  - "Abstract\n   Enterprise network administrators worldwide are in various stages\
    \ of\n   preparing for or deploying IPv6 into their networks.  The\n   administrators\
    \ face different challenges than operators of Internet\n   access providers and\
    \ have reasons for different priorities.  The\n   overall problem for many administrators\
    \ will be to offer Internet-\n   facing services over IPv6 while continuing to\
    \ support IPv4, and while\n   introducing IPv6 access within the enterprise IT\
    \ network.  The\n   overall transition will take most networks from an IPv4-only\n\
    \   environment to a dual-stack network environment and eventually an\n   IPv6-only\
    \ operating mode.  This document helps provide a framework\n   for enterprise\
    \ network architects or administrators who may be faced\n   with many of these\
    \ challenges as they consider their IPv6 support\n   strategies.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   An enterprise network is defined in [RFC4057] as a network\
    \ that has\n   multiple internal links, one or more router connections to one\
    \ or\n   more providers, and is actively managed by a network operations\n   entity\
    \ (the \"administrator\", whether a single person or a department\n   of administrators).\
    \  Administrators generally support an internal\n   network, consisting of users'\
    \ workstations; personal computers;\n   mobile devices; other computing devices\
    \ and related peripherals; a\n   server network, consisting of accounting and\
    \ business application\n   servers; and an external network, consisting of Internet-accessible\n\
    \   services such as web servers, email servers, VPN systems, and\n   customer\
    \ applications.  This document is intended as guidance for\n   enterprise network\
    \ architects and administrators in planning their\n   IPv6 deployments.\n   The\
    \ business reasons for spending time, effort, and money on IPv6\n   will be unique\
    \ to each enterprise.  The most common drivers are due\n   to the fact that when\
    \ Internet service providers, including mobile\n   wireless carriers, run out\
    \ of IPv4 addresses, they will provide\n   native IPv6 and non-native IPv4.  The\
    \ non-native IPv4 service may be\n   NAT64, NAT444, Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite),\
    \ Mapping of Address and Port\n   using Translation (MAP-T), Mapping of Address\
    \ and Port using\n   Encapsulation (MAP-E), or other transition technologies.\
    \  Compared to\n   tunneled or translated service, native traffic typically performs\n\
    \   better and more reliably than non-native.  For example, for client\n   networks\
    \ trying to reach enterprise networks, the IPv6 experience\n   will be better\
    \ than the transitional IPv4 if the enterprise deploys\n   IPv6 in its public-facing\
    \ services.  The native IPv6 network path\n   should also be simpler to manage\
    \ and, if necessary, troubleshoot.\n   Further, enterprises doing business in\
    \ growing parts of the world may\n   find IPv6 growing faster there, where again\
    \ potential new customers,\n   employees, and partners are using IPv6.  It is\
    \ thus in the\n   enterprise's interest to deploy native IPv6 at the very least\
    \ in its\n   public-facing services but ultimately across the majority or all\
    \ of\n   its scope.\n   The text in this document provides specific guidance for\
    \ enterprise\n   networks and complements other related work in the IETF, including\n\
    \   [IPv6-DESIGN] and [RFC5375].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Enterprise Assumptions
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Enterprise Assumptions\n   For the purpose of this document, we assume\
    \ the following:\n   o  The administrator is considering deploying IPv6 (but see\n\
    \      Section 1.2 below).\n   o  The administrator has existing IPv4 networks\
    \ and devices that will\n      continue to operate and be supported.\n   o  The\
    \ administrator will want to minimize the level of disruption to\n      the users\
    \ and services by minimizing the number of technologies\n      and functions that\
    \ are needed to mediate any given application.\n      In other words, provide\
    \ native IP wherever possible.\n   Based on these assumptions, an administrator\
    \ will want to use\n   technologies that minimize the number of flows being tunneled,\n\
    \   translated, or intercepted at any given time.  The administrator will\n  \
    \ choose transition technologies or strategies that both allow most\n   traffic\
    \ to be native and manage non-native traffic.  This will allow\n   the administrator\
    \ to minimize the cost of IPv6 transition\n   technologies by containing the number\
    \ and scale of transition\n   systems.\n   Tunnels used for IPv6/IPv4 transition\
    \ are expected as near-/mid-term\n   mechanisms, while IPv6 tunneling will be\
    \ used for many long-term\n   operational purposes such as security, routing control,\
    \ mobility,\n   multihoming, traffic engineering, etc.  We refer to the former\
    \ class\n   of tunnels as \"transition tunnels\".\n"
- title: 1.2.  IPv4-Only Considerations
  contents:
  - "1.2.  IPv4-Only Considerations\n   As described in [RFC6302], administrators\
    \ should take certain steps\n   even if they are not considering IPv6.  Specifically,\
    \ Internet-facing\n   servers should log the source port number, timestamp (from\
    \ a reliable\n   source), and the transport protocol.  This will allow investigation\n\
    \   of malefactors behind address-sharing technologies such as NAT444,\n   MAP,\
    \ or DS Lite.  Such logs should be protected for integrity,\n   safeguarded for\
    \ privacy, and periodically purged within applicable\n   regulations for log retention.\n\
    \   Other IPv6 considerations may impact ostensibly IPv4-only networks,\n   e.g.,\
    \ [RFC6104] describes the rogue IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA)\n   problem, which\
    \ may cause problems in IPv4-only networks where IPv6 is\n   enabled in end systems\
    \ on that network.  Further discussion of the\n   security implications of IPv6\
    \ in IPv4-only networks can be found in\n   [RFC7123].\n"
- title: 1.3.  Reasons for a Phased Approach
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Reasons for a Phased Approach\n   Given the challenges of transitioning\
    \ user workstations, corporate\n   systems, and Internet-facing servers, a phased\
    \ approach allows\n   incremental deployment of IPv6, based on the administrator's\
    \ own\n   determination of priorities.  This document outlines suggested\n   phases:\
    \ a Preparation and Assessment Phase, an Internal Phase, and an\n   External Phase.\
    \  The Preparation Phase is highly recommended to all\n   administrators, as it\
    \ will save errors and complexity in later\n   phases.  Each administrator must\
    \ decide whether to begin with an\n   External Phase (enabling IPv6 for Internet-facing\
    \ systems, as\n   recommended in [RFC5211]) or an Internal Phase (enabling IPv6\
    \ for\n   internal interconnections first).\n   Each scenario is likely to be\
    \ different to some extent, but we can\n   highlight some considerations:\n  \
    \ o  In many cases, customers outside the network will have IPv6 before\n    \
    \  the internal enterprise network.  For these customers, IPv6 may\n      well\
    \ perform better, especially for certain applications, than\n      translated\
    \ or tunneled IPv4, so the administrator may want to\n      prioritize the External\
    \ Phase such that those customers have the\n      simplest and most robust connectivity\
    \ to the enterprise, or at\n      least its external-facing elements.\n   o  Employees\
    \ who access internal systems by VPN may find that their\n      ISPs provide translated\
    \ IPv4, which does not support the required\n      VPN protocols.  In these cases,\
    \ the administrator may want to\n      prioritize the External Phase and any other\
    \ remotely accessible\n      internal systems.  It is worth noting that a number\
    \ of emerging\n      VPN solutions provide dual-stack connectivity; thus, a VPN\
    \ service\n      may be useful for employees in IPv4-only access networks to access\n\
    \      IPv6 resources in the enterprise network (much like many public\n     \
    \ tunnel broker services, but specifically for the enterprise).\n      Some security\
    \ considerations are described in [RFC7359].\n   o  Internet-facing servers cannot\
    \ be managed over IPv6 unless the\n      management systems are IPv6 capable.\
    \  These might be Network\n      Management Systems (NMS), monitoring systems,\
    \ or just remote\n      management desktops.  Thus, in some cases, the Internet-facing\n\
    \      systems are dependent on IPv6-capable internal networks.  However,\n  \
    \    dual-stack Internet-facing systems can still be managed over IPv4.\n   o\
    \  Virtual Machines (VMs) may enable a faster rollout once initial\n      system\
    \ deployment is complete.  Management of VMs over IPv6 is\n      still dependent\
    \ on the management software supporting IPv6.\n   o  IPv6 is enabled by default\
    \ on all modern operating systems, so it\n      may be more urgent to manage and\
    \ have visibility on the internal\n      traffic.  It is important to manage IPv6\
    \ for security purposes,\n      even in an ostensibly IPv4-only network, as described\
    \ in\n      [RFC7123].\n   o  In many cases, the corporate accounting, payroll,\
    \ human resource,\n      and other internal systems may only need to be reachable\
    \ from the\n      internal network, so they may be a lower priority.  As enterprises\n\
    \      require their vendors to support IPv6, more internal applications\n   \
    \   will support IPv6 by default, and it can be expected that\n      eventually\
    \ new applications will only support IPv6.  The\n      inventory, as described\
    \ in Section 2.2, will help determine the\n      systems' readiness, as well as\
    \ the readiness of the supporting\n      network elements and security, which\
    \ will be a consideration in\n      prioritization of these corporate systems.\n\
    \   o  Some large organizations (even when using private IPv4 addresses\n    \
    \  [RFC1918]) are facing IPv4 address exhaustion because of the\n      internal\
    \ network growth (for example, the vast number of VMs) or\n      because of the\
    \ acquisition of other companies that often raise\n      private IPv4 address\
    \ overlapping issues.\n   o  IPv6 restores end-to-end transparency even for internal\n\
    \      applications (of course security policies must still be enforced).\n  \
    \    When two organizations or networks merge [RFC6879], the unique\n      addressing\
    \ of IPv6 can make the merger much easier and faster.  A\n      merger may, therefore,\
    \ prioritize IPv6 for the affected systems.\n   These considerations are in conflict;\
    \ each administrator must\n   prioritize according to their company's conditions.\
    \  It is worth\n   noting that the reasons given in \"A Large Corporate User's\
    \ View of\n   IPng\", described in [RFC1687], for reluctance to deploy have largely\n\
    \   been satisfied or overcome in the intervening years.\n"

  - "2.1.  Program Planning\n   Since enabling IPv6 is a change to the most fundamental\
    \ Internet\n   Protocol, and since there are so many interdependencies, having\
    \ a\n   professional project manager organize the work is highly recommended.\n\
    \   In addition, an executive sponsor should be involved in determining\n   the\
    \ goals of enabling IPv6 (which will establish the order of the\n   phases) and\
    \ should receive regular updates.\n   It may be necessary to complete the Preparation\
    \ Phase before\n   determining whether to prioritize the Internal or External\
    \ Phase,\n   since needs and readiness assessments are part of that phase.  For\
    \ a\n   large enterprise, it may take several iterations to really understand\n\
    \   the level of effort required.  Depending on the required schedule, it\n  \
    \ may be useful to roll IPv6 projects into other architectural upgrades\n   --\
    \ this can be an excellent way to improve the network and reduce\n   costs.  However,\
    \ by increasing the scope of projects, the schedule is\n   often affected.  For\
    \ instance, a major systems upgrade may take a\n   year to complete, where just\
    \ patching existing systems may take only\n   a few months.\n   The deployment\
    \ of IPv6 will not generally stop all other technology\n   work.  Once IPv6 has\
    \ been identified as an important initiative, all\n   projects, both new and in\
    \ progress, will need to be reviewed to\n   ensure IPv6 support.\n   It is normal\
    \ for assessments to continue in some areas while\n   execution of the project\
    \ begins in other areas.  This is fine, as\n   long as recommendations in other\
    \ parts of this document are\n   considered, especially regarding security (for\
    \ instance, one should\n   not deploy IPv6 on a system before security has been\
    \ evaluated).\n"

- title: 2.2.1.  Network Infrastructure Readiness Assessment
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Network Infrastructure Readiness Assessment\n   The goal of this assessment\
    \ is to identify the level of IPv6\n   readiness of network equipment.  This will\
    \ identify the effort\n   required to move to an infrastructure that supports\
    \ IPv6 with the\n   same functional service capabilities as the existing IPv4\
    \ network.\n   This may also require a feature comparison and gap analysis between\n\
    \   IPv4 and IPv6 functionality on the network equipment and software.\n   IPv6\
    \ support will require testing; features often work differently in\n   vendors'\
    \ labs than production networks.  Some devices and software\n   will require IPv4\
    \ support for IPv6 to work.\n   The inventory will show which network devices\
    \ are already capable,\n   which devices can be made IPv6 ready with a code/firmware\
    \ upgrade,\n   and which devices will need to be replaced.  The data collection\n\
    \   consists of a network discovery to gain an understanding of the\n   topology\
    \ and inventory network infrastructure equipment and code\n   versions with information\
    \ gathered from static files and IP address\n   management, DNS, and DHCP tools.\n\
    \   Since IPv6 might already be present in the environment, through\n   default\
    \ configurations or VPNs, an infrastructure assessment (at\n   minimum) is essential\
    \ to evaluate potential security risks.\n"
- title: 2.2.2.  Application Readiness Assessment
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  Application Readiness Assessment\n   Just like network equipment, application\
    \ software needs to support\n   IPv6.  This includes OS, firmware, middleware,\
    \ and applications\n   (including internally developed applications).  Vendors\
    \ will\n   typically handle IPv6 enablement of off-the-shelf products, but often\n\
    \   enterprises need to request this support from vendors.  For\n   internally\
    \ developed applications, it is the responsibility of the\n   enterprise to enable\
    \ them for IPv6.  Analyzing how a given\n   application communicates over the\
    \ network will dictate the steps\n   required to support IPv6.  Applications should\
    \ avoid instructions\n   specific to a given IP address family.  Any applications\
    \ that use\n   APIs, such as the C language, that expose the IP version\n   specifically,\
    \ need to be modified to also work with IPv6.\n   There are two ways to IPv6-enable\
    \ applications.  The first approach\n   is to have separate logic for IPv4 and\
    \ IPv6, thus leaving the IPv4\n   code path mainly untouched.  This approach causes\
    \ the least\n   disruption to the existing IPv4 logic flow, but introduces more\n\
    \   complexity, since the application now has to deal with two logic\n   loops\
    \ with complex race conditions and error recovery mechanisms\n   between these\
    \ two logic loops.  The second approach is to create a\n   combined IPv4/IPv6\
    \ logic, which ensures operation regardless of the\n   IP version used on the\
    \ network.  Knowing whether a given\n   implementation will use IPv4 or IPv6 in\
    \ a given deployment is a\n   matter of some art; see Source Address Selection\
    \ [RFC6724] and Happy\n   Eyeballs [RFC6555].  It is generally recommended that\
    \ the application\n   developer use industry IPv6-porting tools to locate the\
    \ code that\n   needs to be updated.  Some discussion of IPv6 application porting\n\
    \   issues can be found in [RFC4038].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.2.3.  Importance of Readiness Validation and Testing\n   Lastly, IPv6 introduces\
    \ a completely new way of addressing endpoints,\n   which can have ramifications\
    \ at the network layer all the way up to\n   the applications.  So to minimize\
    \ disruption during the transition\n   phase, we recommend complete functionality,\

    \ when\n   deploying IPv6.  IPv6 is not so different than IPv4: it is a\n   connectionless\
    \ network protocol using the same lower-layer service\n   and delivering the same\
    \ service to the upper layer.  Therefore, the\n   security issues and mitigation\

    \ inherently more secure than IPv4\n   because it is new.  Nothing can be more\
    \ wrong.  Indeed, being a new\n   protocol means that bugs in the implementations\
    \ have yet to be\n   discovered and fixed and that few people have the operational\n\
    \   security expertise needed to operate securely an IPv6 network.  This\n   lack\
    \ of operational expertise is the biggest threat when deploying\n   IPv6: the\
    \ importance of training is to be stressed again.\n   One security myth is that,\
    \ thanks to its huge address space, a\n   network cannot be scanned by enumerating\
    \ all IPv6 addresses in a /64\n   LAN; hence, a malevolent person cannot find\
    \ a victim.  [RFC5157]\n   describes some alternate techniques to find potential\
    \ targets on a\n   network, for example, enumerating all DNS names in a zone.\n\
    \   Additional advice in this area is also given in [HOST-SCANNING].\n   Another\
    \ security myth is that IPv6 is more secure because it mandates\n   the use of\
    \ IPsec everywhere.  While the original IPv6 specifications\n   may have implied\
    \ this, [RFC6434] clearly states that IPsec support is\n   not mandatory.  Moreover,\
    \ if all the intra-enterprise traffic is\n   encrypted, both malefactors and security\
    \ tools that rely on payload\n   inspection (Intrusion Prevention System (IPS),\
    \ firewall, Access\n   Control List (ACL), IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)\
    \ ([RFC7011] and\n   [RFC7012]), etc.) will be affected.  Therefore, IPsec is\
    \ as useful in\n   IPv6 as in IPv4 (for example, to establish a VPN overlay over\
    \ a non-\n   trusted network or to reserve for some specific applications).\n\
    \   The last security myth is that amplification attacks (such as\n   [SMURF])\
    \ do not exist in IPv6 because there is no more broadcast.\n   Alas, this is not\
    \ true as ICMP error (in some cases) or information\n   messages can be generated\
    \ by routers and hosts when forwarding or\n   receiving a multicast message (see\
    \ Section 2.4 of [RFC4443]).\n   Therefore, the generation and the forwarding\
    \ rate of ICMPv6 messages\n   must be limited as in IPv4.\n   It should be noted\
    \ that in a dual-stack network, the security\n   implementation for both IPv4\
    \ and IPv6 needs to be considered, in\n   addition to security considerations\
    \ related to the interaction of\n   (and transition between) the two, while they\
    \ coexist.\n"
- title: 2.4.2.  Similarities between IPv6 and IPv4 Security
  contents:
  - "2.4.2.  Similarities between IPv6 and IPv4 Security\n   As mentioned earlier,\
    \ IPv6 is quite similar to IPv4; therefore,\n   several attacks apply for both\
    \ protocol families, including:\n   o  Application layer attacks: such as cross-site\
    \ scripting or SQL\n      injection\n   o  Rogue device: such as a rogue Wi-Fi\
    \ access point\n   o  Flooding and all traffic-based denial of services (including\
    \ the\n      use of control plane policing for IPv6 traffic: see [RFC6192])\n\
    \   A specific case of congruence is IPv6 Unique Local Addresses (ULAs)\n   [RFC4193]\
    \ and IPv4 private addressing [RFC1918], which do not provide\n   any security\
    \ by 'magic'.  In both cases, the edge router must apply\n   strict filters to\
    \ block those private addresses from entering and,\n   just as importantly, leaving\
    \ the network.  This filtering can be done\n   by the enterprise or by the ISP,\
    \ but the cautious administrator will\n   prefer to do it in the enterprise.\n\
    \   IPv6 addresses can be spoofed as easily as IPv4 addresses, and there\n   are\
    \ packets with bogon IPv6 addresses (see [CYMRU]).  Anti-bogon\n   filtering must\
    \ be done in the data and routing planes.  It can be\n   done by the enterprise\
    \ or by the ISP, or both, but again the cautious\n   administrator will prefer\
    \ to do it in the enterprise.\n"
- title: 2.4.3.  Specific Security Issues for IPv6
  contents:
  - "2.4.3.  Specific Security Issues for IPv6\n   Even if IPv6 is similar to IPv4,\
    \ there are some differences that\n   create some IPv6-only vulnerabilities or\
    \ issues.  We give examples of\n   such differences in this section.\n   Privacy\
    \ extension addresses [RFC4941] are usually used to protect\n   individual privacy\
    \ by periodically changing the interface identifier\n   part of the IPv6 address\
    \ to avoid tracking a host by its otherwise\n   always identical and unique 64-bit\
    \ Extended Unique Identifier\n   (EUI-64) based on Media Access Control (MAC).\
    \  While this presents a\n   real advantage on the Internet, moderated by the\
    \ fact that the prefix\n   part remains the same, it complicates the task of following\
    \ an audit\n   trail when a security officer or network operator wants to trace\
    \ back\n   a log entry to a host in their network because when the tracing is\n\
    \   done, the searched IPv6 address could have disappeared from the\n   network.\
    \  Therefore, the use of privacy extension addresses usually\n   requires additional\
    \ monitoring and logging of the binding of the IPv6\n   address to a data-link\
    \ layer address (see also the monitoring section\n   in [IPv6-SECURITY], Section\
    \ 2.5).  Some early enterprise deployments\n   have taken the approach of using\
    \ tools that harvest IP/MAC address\n   mappings from switch and router devices\
    \ to provide address\n   accountability; this approach has been shown to work,\
    \ though it can\n   involve gathering significantly more address data than in\
    \ equivalent\n   IPv4 networks.  An alternative is to try to prevent the use of\n\
    \   privacy extension addresses by enforcing the use of DHCPv6, such that\n  \
    \ hosts only get addresses assigned by a DHCPv6 server.  This can be\n   done\
    \ by configuring routers to set the M bit in RAs, combined with\n   all advertised\
    \ prefixes being included without the A bit set (to\n   prevent the use of stateless\
    \ autoconfiguration).  Of course, this\n   technique requires that all hosts support\
    \ stateful DHCPv6.  It is\n   important to note that not all operating systems\
    \ exhibit the same\n   behavior when processing RAs with the M bit set.  The varying\
    \ OS\n   behavior is related to the lack of prescriptive definition around the\n\
    \   A, M, and O bits within the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP).\n   [DHCPv6-SLAAC-PROBLEM]\
    \ provides a much more detailed analysis on the\n   interaction of the M bit and\
    \ DHCPv6.\n   Extension headers complicate the task of stateless packet filters\n\
    \   such as ACLs.  If ACLs are used to enforce a security policy, then\n   the\
    \ enterprise must verify whether its ACLs (but also stateful\n   firewalls) are\
    \ able to process extension headers (this means\n   understand them enough to\
    \ parse them to find the upper-layer\n   payloads) and to block unwanted extension\
    \ headers (e.g., to implement\n   [RFC5095]).  This topic is discussed further\
    \ in [RFC7045].\n   Fragmentation is different in IPv6 because it is done only\
    \ by the\n   source host and never during a forwarding operation.  This means\
    \ that\n   ICMPv6 packet-too-big messages must be allowed to pass through the\n\
    \   network and not be filtered [RFC4890].  Fragments can also be used to\n  \
    \ evade some security mechanisms such as RA-Guard [RFC6105].  See also\n   [RFC5722]\
    \ and [RFC7113].\n   One of the biggest differences between IPv4 and IPv6 is the\n\
    \   introduction of NDP [RFC4861], which includes a variety of important\n   IPv6\
    \ protocol functions, including those provided in IPv4 by the\n   Address Resolution\
    \ Protocol (ARP) [RFC0826].  NDP runs over ICMPv6\n   (which as stated above means\
    \ that security policies must allow some\n   ICMPv6 messages to pass, as described\
    \ in RFC 4890), but has the same\n   lack of security as, for example, ARP, in\
    \ that there is no inherent\n   message authentication.  While Secure Neighbor\
    \ Discovery (SEND)\n   [RFC3971] and Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs)\
    \ [RFC3972]\n   have been defined, they are not widely implemented).  The threat\n\
    \   model for RAs within the NDP suite is similar to that of DHCPv4 (and\n   DHCPv6),\
    \ in that a rogue host could be either a rogue router or a\n   rogue DHCP server.\
    \  An IPv4 network can be made more secure with the\n   help of DHCPv4 snooping\
    \ in edge switches, and likewise RA snooping\n   can improve IPv6 network security\
    \ (in IPv4-only networks as well).\n   Thus, enterprises using such techniques\
    \ for IPv4 should use the\n   equivalent techniques for IPv6, including RA-Guard\
    \ [RFC6105] and all\n   work in progress from the Source Address Validation Improvement\n\
    \   (SAVI) WG, e.g., [RFC6959], which is similar to the protection given\n   by\
    \ dynamic ARP monitoring in IPv4.  Other DoS vulnerabilities are\n   related to\
    \ NDP cache exhaustion, and mitigation techniques can be\n   found in ([RFC6583]).\n\
    \   As stated previously, running a dual-stack network doubles the attack\n  \
    \ exposure as a malevolent person has now two attack vectors: IPv4 and\n   IPv6.\
    \  This simply means that all routers and hosts operating in a\n   dual-stack\
    \ environment with both protocol families enabled (even if\n   by default) must\
    \ have a congruent security policy for both protocol\n   versions.  For example,\
    \ permit TCP ports 80 and 443 to all web\n   servers and deny all other ports\
    \ to the same servers must be\n   implemented both for IPv4 and IPv6.  It is thus\
    \ important that the\n   tools available to administrators readily support such\
    \ behavior.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Routing
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Routing\n   An important design choice to be made is what IGP is to use\
    \ inside\n   the network.  A variety of IGPs (IS-IS, OSPFv3, and Routing\n   Information\
    \ Protocol Next Generation (RIPng)) support IPv6 today, and\n   picking one over\
    \ the other is a design choice that will be dictated\n   mostly by existing operational\
    \ policies in an enterprise network.  As\n   mentioned earlier, it would be beneficial\
    \ to maintain operational\n   parity between IPv4 and IPv6; therefore, it might\
    \ make sense to\n   continue using the same protocol family that is being used\
    \ for IPv4.\n   For example, in a network using OSPFv2 for IPv4, it might make\
    \ sense\n   to use OSPFv3 for IPv6.  It is important to note that although OSPFv3\n\
    \   is similar to OSPFv2, they are not the same.  On the other hand, some\n  \
    \ organizations may chose to run different routing protocols for\n   different\
    \ IP versions.  For example, one may chose to run OSPFv2 for\n   IPv4 and IS-IS\
    \ for IPv6.  An important design question to consider\n   here is whether to support\
    \ one IGP or two different IGPs in the\n   longer term.  [IPv6-DESIGN] presents\
    \ advice on the design choices\n   that arise when considering IGPs and discusses\
    \ the advantages and\n   disadvantages to different approaches in detail.\n"
- title: 2.6.  Address Plan
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Address Plan\n   The most common problem encountered in IPv6 networking\
    \ is in applying\n   the same principles of conservation that are so important\
    \ in IPv4.\n   IPv6 addresses do not need to be assigned conservatively.  In fact,\
    \ a\n   single, larger allocation is considered more conservative than\n   multiple\
    \ non-contiguous small blocks because a single block occupies\n   only a single\
    \ entry in a routing table.  The advice in [RFC5375] is\n   still sound and is\
    \ recommended to the reader.  If considering ULAs,\n   give careful thought to\
    \ how well it is supported, especially in\n   multiple address and multicast scenarios,\
    \ and assess the strength of\n   the requirement for ULA.  [ULA-USAGE] provides\
    \ much more detailed\n   analysis and recommendations on the usage of ULAs.\n\
    \   The enterprise administrator will want to evaluate whether the\n   enterprise\
    \ will request address space from a Local Internet Registry\n   (LIR) such as\
    \ an ISP; a Regional Internet Registry (RIR) such as\n   AfriNIC, APNIC, ARIN,\
    \ LACNIC, or RIPE-NCC; or a National Internet\n   Registry (NIR) operated in some\
    \ countries.  The normal allocation is\n   Provider-Aggregated (PA) address space\
    \ from the enterprise's ISP, but\n   use of PA space implies renumbering when\
    \ changing providers.\n   Instead, an enterprise may request Provider-Independent\
    \ (PI) space;\n   this may involve an additional fee, but the enterprise may then\
    \ be\n   better able to be multihomed using that prefix and will avoid a\n   renumbering\
    \ process when changing ISPs (though it should be noted\n   that renumbering caused\
    \ by outgrowing the space, merger, or other\n   internal reason would still not\
    \ be avoided with PI space).\n   The type of address selected (PI vs. PA) should\
    \ be congruent with the\n   routing needs of the enterprise.  The selection of\
    \ address type will\n   determine if an operator will need to apply new routing\
    \ techniques\n   and may limit future flexibility.  There is no right answer,\
    \ but the\n   needs of the External Phase may affect what address type is selected.\n\
    \   Each network location or site will need a prefix assignment.\n   Depending\
    \ on the type of site/location, various prefix sizes may be\n   used.  In general,\
    \ historical guidance suggests that each site should\n   get at least a /48, as\
    \ documented in RFC 5375 and [RFC6177].  In\n   addition to allowing for simple\
    \ planning, this can allow a site to\n   use its prefix for local connectivity,\
    \ should the need arise, and if\n   the local ISP supports it.\n   When assigning\
    \ addresses to end systems, the enterprise may use\n   manually configured addresses\
    \ (common on servers) or Stateless\n   Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) or DHCPv6\
    \ for client systems.\n   Early IPv6 enterprise deployments have used SLAAC both\
    \ for its\n   simplicity and the time DHCPv6 has taken to mature.  However, DHCPv6\n\
    \   is now very mature; thus, workstations managed by an enterprise may\n   use\
    \ stateful DHCPv6 for addressing on corporate LAN segments.  DHCPv6\n   allows\
    \ for the additional configuration options often employed by\n   enterprise administrators,\
    \ and by using stateful DHCPv6,\n   administrators correlating system logs know\
    \ which system had which\n   address at any given time.  Such an accountability\
    \ model is familiar\n   from IPv4 management, though DHCPv6 hosts are identified\
    \ by a DHCP\n   Unique Identifier (DUID) rather than a MAC address.  For equivalent\n\
    \   accountability with SLAAC (and potentially privacy addresses), a\n   monitoring\
    \ system that harvests IP/MAC mappings from switch and\n   router equipment could\
    \ be used.\n   A common deployment consideration for any enterprise network is\
    \ how\n   to get host DNS records updated.  Commonly, either the host will send\n\
    \   DNS updates or the DHCP server will update records.  If there is\n   sufficient\
    \ trust between the hosts and the DNS server, the hosts may\n   update (and the\
    \ enterprise may use SLAAC for addressing).  Otherwise,\n   the DHCPv6 server\
    \ can be configured to update the DNS server.  Note\n   that an enterprise network\
    \ with this more controlled environment will\n   need to disable SLAAC on network\
    \ segments and force end hosts to use\n   DHCPv6 only.\n   In the data center\
    \ or server room, assume a /64 per VLAN.  This\n   applies even if each individual\
    \ system is on a separate VLAN.  In a\n   /48 assignment, typical for a site,\
    \ there are then still 65,535 /64\n   blocks.  Some administrators reserve a /64\
    \ but configure a small\n   subnet, such as /112, /126, or /127, to prevent rogue\
    \ devices from\n   attaching and getting numbers; an alternative is to monitor\
    \ traffic\n   for surprising addresses or Neighbor Discovery (ND) tables for new\n\
    \   entries.  Addresses are either configured manually on the server or\n   reserved\
    \ on a DHCPv6 server, which may also synchronize forward and\n   reverse DNS (though\
    \ see [RFC6866] for considerations on static\n   addressing).  SLAAC is not recommended\
    \ for servers because of the\n   need to synchronize RA timers with DNS Times\
    \ to Live (TTLs) so that\n   the DNS entry expires at the same time as the address.\n\
    \   All user access networks should be a /64.  Point-to-point links where\n  \
    \ NDP is not used may also utilize a /127 (see [RFC6164]).\n   Plan to aggregate\
    \ at every layer of network hierarchy.  There is no\n   need for variable length\
    \ subnet mask (VLSM) [RFC1817] in IPv6, and\n   addressing plans based on conservation\
    \ of addresses are shortsighted.\n   Use of prefixes longer then /64 on network\
    \ segments will break common\n   IPv6 functions such as SLAAC [RFC4862].  Where\
    \ multiple VLANs or\n   other Layer 2 domains converge, allow some room for expansion.\n\
    \   Renumbering due to outgrowing the network plan is a nuisance, so\n   allow\
    \ room within it.  Generally, plan to grow to about twice the\n   current size\
    \ that can be accommodated; where rapid growth is planned,\n   allow for twice\
    \ that growth.  Also, if DNS (or reverse DNS) authority\n   may be delegated to\
    \ others in the enterprise, assignments need to be\n   on nibble boundaries (that\
    \ is, on a multiple of 4 bits, such as /64,\n   /60, /56, ..., /48, /44), to ensure\
    \ that delegated zones align with\n   assigned prefixes.\n   If using ULAs, it\
    \ is important to note that AAAA and PTR records for\n   ULAs are not recommended\
    \ to be installed in the global DNS.\n   Similarly, reverse (address-to-name)\
    \ queries for ULA must not be sent\n   to name servers outside of the organization,\
    \ due to the load that\n   such queries would create for the authoritative name\
    \ servers for the\n   ip6.arpa zone.  For more details, please refer to Section\
    \ 4.4 of\n   [RFC4193].\n   Enterprise networks are increasingly including virtual\
    \ networks where\n   a single, physical node may host many virtualized addressable\n\
    \   devices.  It is imperative that the addressing plans assigned to\n   these\
    \ virtual networks and devices be consistent and non-overlapping\n   with the\
    \ addresses assigned to real networks and nodes.  For example,\n   a virtual network\
    \ established within an isolated lab environment may,\n   at a later time, become\
    \ attached to the production enterprise\n   network.\n"
- title: 2.7.  Tools Assessment
  contents:
  - "2.7.  Tools Assessment\n   Enterprises will often have a number of operational\
    \ tools and support\n   systems that are used to provision, monitor, manage, and\
    \ diagnose the\n   network and systems within their environment.  These tools\
    \ and\n   systems will need to be assessed for compatibility with IPv6.  The\n\
    \   compatibility may be related to the addressing and connectivity of\n   various\
    \ devices as well as IPv6 awareness of the tools and processing\n   logic.\n \
    \  The tools within the organization fall into two general categories:\n   those\
    \ that focus on managing the network and those that are focused\n   on managing\
    \ systems and applications on the network.  In either\n   instance, the tools\
    \ will run on platforms that may or may not be\n   capable of operating in an\
    \ IPv6 network.  This lack in functionality\n   may be related to operating system\
    \ version or based on some hardware\n   constraint.  Those systems that are found\
    \ to be incapable of\n   utilizing an IPv6 connection, or which are dependent\
    \ on an IPv4\n   stack, may need to be replaced or upgraded.\n   In addition to\
    \ devices working on an IPv6 network natively, or via a\n   transition tunnel,\
    \ many tools and support systems may require\n   additional software updates to\
    \ be IPv6 aware or even a hardware\n   upgrade (usually for additional memory,\
    \ IPv6 addresses are larger and\n   for a while, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses will\
    \ coexist in the tool).  This\n   awareness may include the ability to manage\
    \ IPv6 elements and/or\n   applications in addition to the ability to store and\
    \ utilize IPv6\n   addresses.\n   Considerations when assessing the tools and\
    \ support systems may\n   include the fact that IPv6 addresses are significantly\
    \ larger than\n   IPv4, requiring data stores to support the increased size. \
    \ Such\n   issues are among those discussed in [RFC5952].  Many organizations\n\
    \   may also run dual-stack networks; therefore, the tools need to not\n   only\
    \ support IPv6 operation but may also need to support the\n   monitoring, management,\
    \ and intersection with both IPv6 and IPv4\n   simultaneously.  It is important\
    \ to note that managing IPv6 is not\n   just constrained to using large IPv6 addresses,\
    \ but also that IPv6\n   interfaces and nodes are likely to use two or more addresses\
    \ as part\n   of normal operation.  Updating management systems to deal with these\n\
    \   additional nuances will likely consume time and considerable effort.\n   For\
    \ networking systems, like node management systems, it is not\n   always necessary\
    \ to support local IPv6 addressing and connectivity.\n   Operations such as SNMP\
    \ MIB polling can occur over IPv4 transport\n   while seeking responses related\
    \ to IPv6 information.  Where this may\n   seem advantageous to some, it should\
    \ be noted that without local IPv6\n   connectivity, the management system may\
    \ not be able to perform all\n   expected functions -- such as reachability and\
    \ service checks.\n   Organizations should be aware that changes to older IPv4-only\
    \ SNMP\n   MIB specifications have been made by the IETF and are related to\n\
    \   legacy operation in [RFC2096] and [RFC2011].  Updated specifications\n   are\
    \ now available in [RFC4292] and [RFC4293] that modified the older\n   MIB framework\
    \ to be IP protocol agnostic, supporting both IPv4 and\n   IPv6.  Polling systems\
    \ will need to be upgraded to support these\n   updates as well as the end stations,\
    \ which are polled.\n"

    \ security and monitoring of various elements, and\n   outward-facing or accessible\
    \ services.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Connectivity
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Connectivity\n   The enterprise will need to work with one or more service\
    \ providers\n   to gain connectivity to the Internet or transport service\n  \
    \ infrastructure such as a BGP/MPLS IP VPN as described in [RFC4364]\n   and [RFC4659].\
    \  One significant factor that will guide how an\n   organization may need to\
    \ communicate with the outside world will\n   involve the use of PI and/or PA\
    \ IPv6 space.\n   Enterprises should be aware that, depending on which address\
    \ type\n   they selected (PI vs. PA) in their planning phase, they may need to\n\
    \   implement new routing functions and/or behaviors to support their\n   connectivity\
    \ to the ISP.  In the case of PI, the upstream ISP may\n   offer options to route\
    \ the prefix (typically a /48) on the\n   enterprise's behalf and update the relevant\
    \ routing databases.\n   Otherwise, the enterprise may need to perform this task\
    \ on their own\n   and use BGP to inject the prefix into the global BGP system.\n\
    \   Note that the rules set by the RIRs for an enterprise acquiring PI\n   address\
    \ space have changed over time.  For example, in the European\n   region, the\
    \ RIPE-NCC no longer requires an enterprise to be\n   multihomed to be eligible\

    \  It is possible that the rules may change\n   again and may vary between RIRs.\n\

    \ is preferred since it provides the most robust and\n   efficient form of connectivity.\
    \  If native IPv6 connectivity is not\n   possible due to technical or business\
    \ limitations, the enterprise may\n   utilize readily available transition tunnel\

  - "3.2.  Security\n   The most important part of security for external IPv6 deployment\
    \ is\n   filtering and monitoring.  Filtering can be done by stateless ACLs or\n\
    \   a stateful firewall.  The security policies must be consistent for\n   IPv4\
    \ and IPv6 (or else the attacker will use the less-protected\n   protocol stack),\
    \ except that certain ICMPv6 messages must be allowed\n   through and to the filtering\
    \ device (see [RFC4890]):\n   o  Packet Too Big: essential to allow Path MTU discovery\
    \ to work\n   o  Parameter Problem\n   o  Time Exceeded\n   In addition, NDP messages\
    \ (including Neighbor Solicitation, RAs,\n   etc.) are required for local hosts.\n\
    \   It could also be safer to block all fragments where the transport\n   layer\
    \ header is not in the first fragment to avoid attacks as\n   described in [RFC5722].\
    \  Some filtering devices allow this filtering.\n   Ingress filters and firewalls\
    \ should follow [RFC5095] in handling\n   routing extension header type 0, dropping\
    \ the packet and sending\n   ICMPv6 Parameter Problem, unless Segments Left =\
    \ 0 (in which case,\n   ignore the header).\n   If an IPS is used for IPv4 traffic,\
    \ then an IPS should also be used\n   for IPv6 traffic.  In general, make sure\
    \ IPv6 security is at least as\n   good as IPv4.  This also includes all email\
    \ content protection (anti-\n   spam, content filtering, data leakage prevention,\
    \ etc.).\n   The edge router must also implement anti-spoofing techniques based\
    \ on\n   [RFC2827] (also known as BCP 38).\n   In order to protect the networking\
    \ devices, it is advised to\n   implement control plane policing as per [RFC6192].\n\
    \   The potential NDP cache exhaustion attack (see [RFC6583]) can be\n   mitigated\
    \ by two techniques:\n   o  Good NDP implementation with memory utilization limits\
    \ as well as\n      rate limiters and prioritization of requests.\n   o  Or, as\
    \ the external deployment usually involves just a couple of\n      exposed statically\
    \ configured IPv6 addresses (virtual addresses of\n      web, email, and DNS servers),\
    \ then it is straightforward to build\n      an ingress ACL allowing traffic for\
    \ those addresses and denying\n      traffic to any other addresses.  This actually\
    \ prevents the attack\n      as a packet for a random destination will be dropped\

    \ SYN flooding, and related IP source addresses) from monitoring tools\n   and\
    \ evaluating data read from SNMP MIBs [RFC4293] (some of which also\n   enable\
    \ the detection of abnormal bandwidth utilization) and syslogs\n   (finding server\

    \ (including personally\n   identifiable information) and care in securing it\
    \ should be taken,\n   with periodic purges.  Integrity protection on logs and\
    \ sources of\n   log data is also important to detect unusual behavior\n   (misconfigurations\
    \ or attacks).  Logs may be used in investigations,\n   which depend on trustworthy\
    \ data sources (tamper resistant).\n   In addition, monitoring of external services\
    \ (such as web sites)\n   should be made address specific, so that people are\

- title: 3.4.  Servers and Applications
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Servers and Applications\n   The path to the servers accessed from the\
    \ Internet usually involves\n   security devices (firewall and IPS), server load\
    \ balancing (SLB), and\n   real physical servers.  The latter stage is also multi-tiered\
    \ for\n   scalability and security between presentation and data storage.  The\n\
    \   ideal transition is to enable native dual stack on all devices; but\n   as\
    \ part of the phased approach, operators have used the following\n   techniques\
    \ with success:\n   o  Use a network device to apply NAT64 and basically translate\
    \ an\n      inbound TCP connection (or any other transport protocol) over IPv6\n\
    \      into a TCP connection over IPv4.  This is the easiest to deploy as\n  \
    \    the path is mostly unchanged, but it hides all IPv6 remote users\n      behind\
    \ a single IPv4 address, which leads to several audit trail\n      and security\
    \ issues (see [RFC6302]).\n   o  Use the server load balancer, which acts as an\
    \ application proxy\n      to do this translation.  Compared to the NAT64, it\
    \ has the\n      potential benefit of going through the security devices as native\n\
    \      IPv6 (so more audit and trace abilities) and is also able to\n      insert\
    \ an HTTP X-Forward-For header that contains the remote IPv6\n      address. \
    \ The latter feature allows for logging and rate limiting\n      on the real servers\
    \ based on the IPV6 address even if those\n      servers run only IPv4.\n   In\
    \ either of these cases, care should be taken to secure logs for\n   privacy reasons\

- title: 4.2.  Network Infrastructure
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Network Infrastructure\n   The typical enterprise network infrastructure\
    \ comprises a combination\n   of the following network elements -- wired access\
    \ switches, wireless\n   access points, and routers (although it is fairly common\
    \ to find\n   hardware that collapses switching and routing functionality into\
    \ a\n   single device).  Basic wired access switches and access points\n   operate\
    \ only at the physical and link layers and don't really have\n   any special IPv6\
    \ considerations other than being able to support IPv6\n   addresses themselves\
    \ for management purposes.  In many instances,\n   these devices possess a lot\
    \ more intelligence than simply switching\n   packets.  For example, some of these\
    \ devices help assist with link-\n   layer security by incorporating features\
    \ such as ARP inspection and\n   DHCP snooping, or they may help limit where multicast\
    \ floods by using\n   IGMP (or, in the case of IPv6, Multicast Listener Discovery\
    \ (MLD))\n   snooping.\n   Another important consideration in enterprise networks\
    \ is first-hop\n   router redundancy.  This directly ties into network reachability\
    \ from\n   an end host's point of view.  IPv6 ND [RFC4861] provides a node with\n\
    \   the capability to maintain a list of available routers on the link,\n   in\
    \ order to be able to switch to a backup path should the primary be\n   unreachable.\
    \  By default, ND will detect a router failure in 38\n   seconds and cycle onto\
    \ the next default router listed in its cache.\n   While this feature provides\
    \ a basic level of first-hop router\n   redundancy, most enterprise IPv4 networks\
    \ are designed to fail over\n   much faster.  Although this delay can be improved\
    \ by adjusting the\n   default timers, care must be taken to protect against transient\n\
    \   failures and to account for increased traffic on the link.  Another\n   option\
    \ in which to provide robust first-hop redundancy is to use the\n   Virtual Router\
    \ Redundancy Protocol Version 3 (VRRPv3) for IPv6\n   [RFC5798].  This protocol\
    \ provides a much faster switchover to an\n   alternate default router than default\
    \ ND parameters.  Using VRRPv3, a\n   backup router can take over for a failed\
    \ default router in around\n   three seconds (using VRRPv3 default parameters).\
    \  This is done\n   without any interaction with the hosts and a minimum amount\
    \ of VRRP\n   traffic.\n   Last but not least, one of the most important design\
    \ choices to make\n   while deploying IPv6 on the internal network is whether\
    \ to use SLAAC\n   [RFC4862], the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6\
    \ (DHCPv6)\n   [RFC3315], or a combination thereof.  Each option has advantages\
    \ and\n   disadvantages, and the choice will ultimately depend on the\n   operational\
    \ policies that guide each enterprise's network design.\n   For example, if an\
    \ enterprise is looking for ease of use, rapid\n   deployment, and less administrative\
    \ overhead, then SLAAC makes more\n   sense for workstations.  Manual or DHCPv6\
    \ assignments are still\n   needed for servers, as described in the Address Plan\
    \ and External\n   Phase sections of this document; see Sections 2.6 and 3,\n\
    \   respectively.  However, if the operational policies call for precise\n   control\
    \ over IP address assignment for auditing, then DHCPv6 may be\n   preferred. \
    \ DHCPv6 also allows you to tie into DNS systems for host\n   entry updates and\
    \ gives you the ability to send other options and\n   information to clients.\
    \  It is worth noting that in general\n   operation, RAs are still needed in DHCPv6\
    \ networks, as there is no\n   DHCPv6 Default Gateway option.  Similarly, DHCPv6\
    \ is needed in RA\n   networks for other configuration information, e.g., NTP\
    \ servers or,\n   in the absence of support for DNS resolvers in RAs [RFC6106],\
    \ DNS\n   resolver information.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.3.  End-User Devices\n   Most operating systems (OSes) that are loaded on workstations\
    \ and\n   laptops in a typical enterprise support IPv6 today.  However, there\n\
    \   are various out-of-the-box nuances that one should be mindful about.\n   For\
    \ example, the default behavior of OSes vary; some may have IPv6\n   turned off\
    \ by default, some may only have certain features such as\n   privacy extensions\
    \ to IPv6 addresses (RFC 4941) turned off, while\n   others have IPv6 fully enabled.\
    \  Further, even when IPv6 is enabled,\n   the choice of which address is used\
    \ may be subject to source address\n   selection (RFC 6724) and Happy Eyeballs\
    \ (RFC 6555).  Therefore, it is\n   advised that enterprises investigate the default\
    \ behavior of their\n   installed OS base and account for it during the Inventory\
    \ Phases of\n   their IPv6 preparations.  Furthermore, some OSes may have some\n\
    \   transition tunneling mechanisms turned on by default, and in such\n   cases,\
    \ it is recommended to administratively shut down such\n   interfaces unless required.\n\
    \   It is important to note that it is recommended that IPv6 be deployed\n   at\
    \ the network and system infrastructure level before it is rolled\n   out to end-user\
    \ devices; ensure IPv6 is running and routed on the\n   wire, and secure and correctly\
    \ monitored, before exposing IPv6 to end\n   users.\n   Smartphones and tablets\
    \ are significant IPv6-capable platforms,\n   depending on the support of the\
    \ carrier's data network.\n   IPv6 support for peripherals varies.  Much like\

- title: 5.  IPv6 Only
  contents:
  - "5.  IPv6 Only\n   Early IPv6 enterprise deployments have generally taken a dual-stack\n\
    \   approach to enabling IPv6, i.e., the existing IPv4 services have not\n   been\
    \ turned off.  Although IPv4 and IPv6 networks will coexist for a\n   long time,\
    \ the long-term enterprise network roadmap should include\n   steps to simplify\
    \ engineering and operations by deprecating IPv4 from\n   the dual-stack network.\
    \  In some extreme cases, deploying dual-stack\n   networks may not even be a\
    \ viable option for very large enterprises\n   due to the address space described\
    \ in RFC 1918 not being large enough\n   to support the network's growth.  In\
    \ such cases, deploying IPv6-only\n   networks might be the only choice available\
    \ to sustain network\n   growth.  In other cases, there may be elements of an\
    \ otherwise dual-\n   stack network that may be run in IPv6 only.\n   If nodes\
    \ in the network don't need to talk to an IPv4-only node, then\n   deploying IPv6-only\
    \ networks should be straightforward.  However,\n   most nodes will need to communicate\
    \ with some IPv4-only nodes; an\n   IPv6-only node may, therefore, require a translation\
    \ mechanism.  As\n   [RFC6144] points out, it is important to look at address\
    \ translation\n   as a transition strategy towards running an IPv6-only network.\n\
    \   There are various stateless and stateful IPv4/IPv6 translation\n   methods\
    \ available today that help IPv6-to-IPv4 communication.  RFC\n   6144 provides\
    \ a framework for IPv4/IPv6 translation and describes in\n   detail various scenarios\
    \ in which such translation mechanisms could\n   be used.  [RFC6145] describes\
    \ stateless address translation.  In this\n   mode, a specific IPv6 address range\
    \ will represent IPv4 systems\n   (IPv4-converted addresses), and the IPv6 systems\
    \ have addresses\n   (IPv4-translatable addresses) that can be algorithmically\
    \ mapped to a\n   subset of the service provider's IPv4 addresses.  NAT64 [RFC6146]\n\
    \   describes stateful address translation.  As the name suggests, the\n   translation\
    \ state is maintained between IPv4 address/port pairs and\n   IPv6 address/port\
    \ pairs, enabling IPv6 systems to open sessions with\n   IPv4 systems.  DNS64\
    \ [RFC6147] describes a mechanism for synthesizing\n   AAAA resource records (RRs)\
    \ from A RRs.  Together, RFCs 6146 and RFC\n   6147 provide a viable method for\
    \ an IPv6-only client to initiate\n   communications to an IPv4-only server. \
    \ As described in Enterprise\n   Assumptions, Section 1.1, the administrator will\
    \ usually want most\n   traffic or flows to be native and only translate as needed.\n\
    \   The address translation mechanisms for the stateless and stateful\n   translations\
    \ are defined in [RFC6052].  It is important to note that\n   both of these mechanisms\
    \ have limitations as to which protocols they\n   support.  For example, RFC 6146\
    \ only defines how stateful NAT64\n   translates unicast packets carrying TCP,\
    \ UDP, and ICMP traffic only.\n   The classic problems of IPv4 NAT also apply,\
    \ e.g., handling IP\n   literals in application payloads.  The ultimate choice\
    \ of which\n   translation mechanism to chose will be dictated mostly by existing\n\
    \   operational policies pertaining to application support, logging\n   requirements,\
    \ etc.\n   There is additional work being done in the area of address\n   translation\
    \ to enhance and/or optimize current mechanisms.  For\n   example, [DIVI] describes\
    \ limitations with the current stateless\n   translation, such as IPv4 address\
    \ sharing and application layer\n   gateway (ALG) problems, and presents the concept\
    \ and implementation\n   of dual-stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation (dIVI) to address\
    \ those\n   issues.\n   It is worth noting that for IPv6-only access networks\
    \ that use\n   technologies such as NAT64, the more content providers (and\n \
    \  enterprises) that make their content available over IPv6, the less\n   the\
    \ requirement to apply NAT64 to traffic leaving the access network.\n   This particular\
    \ point is important for enterprises that may start\n   their IPv6 deployment\
    \ well into the global IPv6 transition.  As time\n   progresses, and given the\
    \ current growth in availability of IPv6\n   content, IPv6-only operation using\
    \ NAT64 to manage some flows will\n   become less expensive to run versus the\
    \ traditional NAT44 deployments\n   since only IPv6-to-IPv4 flows need translation.\
    \  [RFC6883] provides\n   guidance and suggestions for Internet Content Providers\
    \ and\n   Application Service Providers in this context.\n   Enterprises should\
    \ also be aware that networks may be subject to\n   future convergence with other\
    \ networks (i.e., mergers, acquisitions,\n   etc.).  An enterprise considering\
    \ IPv6-only operation may need to be\n   aware that additional transition technologies\
    \ and/or connectivity\n   strategies may be required depending on the level of\
    \ IPv6 readiness\n   and deployment in the merging networking.\n"

    \  This is where IPv6-related research\n      and/or teaching is most likely to\
    \ occur, and where many of the\n      next generation of network engineers are\
    \ studying, so enabling\n      some or all of the campus computer science department\
    \ network is a\n      sensible first step.\n   o  The eduroam wireless network.\
    \  Eduroam [EDUROAM] is the de facto\n      wireless roaming system for academic\
    \ networks and uses\n      authentication based on 802.1X, which is agnostic to\
    \ the IP\n      version used (unlike web-redirection gateway systems).  Making\
    \ a\n      campus' eduroam network dual stack is a very viable early step.\n \
    \  The general IPv6 deployment model in a campus enterprise will still\n   follow\
    \ the general principles described in this document.  While the\n   above early\
    \ stage projects are commonly followed, these still require\n   the campus to\
    \ acquire IPv6 connectivity and address space from their\n   NREN (or other provider\
    \ in some parts of the world) and to enable\n   IPv6 on the wire on at least part\
    \ of the core of the campus network.\n   This implies a requirement to have an\
    \ initial address plan, and to\n   ensure appropriate monitoring and security\
    \ measures are in place, as\n   described elsewhere in this document.\n   Campuses\
    \ that have deployed to date do not use ULAs, nor do they use\n   NPTv6.  In general,\
    \ campuses have very stable PA-based address\n   allocations from their NRENs\
    \ (or their equivalent).  However, campus\n   enterprises may consider applying\
    \ for IPv6 PI; some have already done\n   so.  The discussions earlier in this\
    \ text about PA vs. PI still\n   apply.\n   Finally, campuses may be more likely\
    \ than many other enterprises to\n   run multicast applications, such as IP TV\
    \ or live lecture or seminar\n   streaming, so they may wish to consider support\
    \ for specific IPv6\n   multicast functionality, e.g., the Embedded Rendezvous\
    \ Point\n   (Embedded-RP) [RFC3956] in routers and MLDv1 and MLDv2 snooping in\n\
    \   switches.\n"
