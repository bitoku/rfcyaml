Abstract RFC 4492 describes elliptic curve cipher suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS).
However, all those cipher suites use HMAC SHA 1 as their Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm.
This document describes sixteen new cipher suites for TLS that specify stronger MAC algorithms.
Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) with SHA 256 or SHA 384, and eight use AES in Galois Counter Mode (GCM).
[RFC4492] describes Elliptic Curve Cryptography
(ECC) cipher suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS).
However, all of the RFC 4492 suites use HMAC SHA1 as their MAC algorithm.
Due to recent analytic work on SHA 1 [Wang05], the IETF is gradually moving away from SHA 1 and towards stronger hash algorithms.
TLS ECC cipher suites that use SHA 256 and SHA 384 [SHS] rather than SHA 1.
TLS 1.2 [RFC5246], adds support for authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) cipher modes [RFC5116].
This document also specifies a set of ECC cipher suites using one such mode, Galois Counter Mode (GCM) [GCM].
Another document [RFC5288] provides support for GCM with other key establishment methods.
Conventions Used in This Document
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "
SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
This document defines 16 new cipher suites to be added to TLS.
All use Elliptic Curve Cryptography for key exchange and digital signature, as defined in RFC 4492.
The first eight cipher suites use AES [AES] in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
[CBC] mode with an HMAC based MAC:
CipherSuite TLS ECDHE ECDSA WITH AES 128
; CipherSuite TLS ECDH ECDSA WITH AES 128
These SHALL be as follows:
For cipher suites ending with  SHA256, the PRF is the TLS PRF [RFC5246] with SHA 256 as the hash function.
The MAC is HMAC [RFC2104] with SHA 256 as the hash function.
For cipher suites ending with  SHA384, the PRF is the TLS PRF [RFC5246] with SHA 384 as the hash function.
The MAC is HMAC [RFC2104] with SHA 384 as the hash function.
Galois Counter Mode Based Cipher Suites
The second eight cipher suites use the same asymmetric algorithms as those in the previous section but use the new authenticated encryption modes defined in TLS 1.2 with AES in Galois Counter Mode (GCM) [GCM]:
CipherSuite TLS ECDHE ECDSA WITH AES 128 GCM
256 GCM described in [RFC5116].
GCM is used as described in [RFC5288].
The PRFs SHALL be as follows:
For cipher suites ending with  SHA256, the PRF is the TLS PRF [RFC5246] with SHA 256 as the hash function.
For cipher suites ending with  SHA384, the PRF is the TLS PRF [RFC5246] with SHA 384 as the hash function.
The security considerations in RFC 4346, RFC 4492, and [RFC5288] apply to this document as well.
In addition, as described in [RFC5288], these cipher suites may only be used with TLS 1.2 or greater.
IANA Considerations IANA has assigned the following values for these cipher suites:
CipherSuite TLS ECDHE ECDSA WITH AES 128
; CipherSuite TLS ECDH ECDSA WITH AES 128
