  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   This document describes how Novell IPX operates over various\
    \ WAN\n   media. It is strongly motivated by a desire for IPX to treat ALL wide\n\
    \   area links in the same manner. Sections 3 and 4 describe this common\n   \"\
    IPX WAN\" protocol.\n   IPX WAN protocol operation begins immediately after link\n\
    \   establishment. While IPX is a connectionless datagram protocol, WANs\n   are\
    \ often connection-oriented.  Different WANs have different methods\n   of link\
    \ establishment. The subsections of section 1 of this document\n   describe what\
    \ link establishment means to IPX for different media.\n   They also describe\
    \ other WAN-media-dependent aspects of IPX\n   operation, such as protocol identification,\
    \ frame encapsulation, and\n   link tear down.\n"
- title: 1.1 Operation Over PPP
  contents:
  - "1.1 Operation Over PPP\n   IPX uses PPP [1] when operating over point-to-point\
    \ synchronous and\n   asynchronous networks.\n   With PPP, link establishment\
    \ means the IPX NCP [4] reaches the Open\n   state. NetWare IPX will reject all\
    \ NCP options, and uses normal frame\n   encapsulation as defined by PPP. The\
    \ IPXWAN protocol MUST NOT occur\n   until the IPX NCP reaches the Open state.\n\
    \   PPP allows either side of a connection to stop forwarding IPX if one\n   end\
    \ sends an IPXCP or an LCP Terminate-Request. When a router detects\n   this,\
    \ it will immediately reflect the lost connectivity in its\n   routing information\
    \ database instead of naturally aging it out.\n"
- title: 1.2 Operation over X.25 Switched Virtual Circuits
  contents:
  - "1.2 Operation over X.25 Switched Virtual Circuits\n   With X.25, link establishment\
    \ means successfully opening an X.25\n   virtual circuit.  As specified in RFC-1356,\
    \ \"Multiprotocol\n   Interconnect on X.25 and ISDN in the Packet Mode\" [2],\
    \ the protocol\n   identifier 0x800000008137 is used in the X.25 Call User Data\
    \ field of\n   the Call Request frame, and indicates that the virtual circuit\
    \ will\n   be devoted to IPX.\n   Furthermore, each IPX packet is encapsulated\
    \ directly in X.25 data\n   frame sequences without additional framing.\n   Either\
    \ side of the virtual circuit may close it, thereby tearing down\n   the IPX link.\
    \ When a router detects this, it will immediately reflect\n   the lost connectivity\
    \ in its routing information database instead of\n   naturally aging it out.\n"
- title: 1.3 Operation over X.25 Permanent Virtual Circuits
  contents:
  - "1.3 Operation over X.25 Permanent Virtual Circuits\n   The nature of X.25 PVC's\
    \ is that no call request is made.  When the\n   router is informed that X.25\
    \ Layer 2 is up, the router should assume\n   that link establishment is complete.\n\
    \   Each IPX packet is encapsulated in an X.25 data frame sequence\n   without\
    \ additional framing. Novell IPX assumes a particular X.25\n   permanent circuit\
    \ is devoted to the use of IPX.\n   If a router receives a layer 2 error condition\
    \ (e.g., X.25 Restart),\n   it should reflect lost connectivity for the permanent\
    \ circuits in its\n   routing information database and re-perform the necessary\
    \ steps to\n   obtain a full IPX connection.\n"

- title: 'Primary Network Number:'
  contents:
  - "Primary Network Number:\n      Every IPX WAN router has a \"primary network number\"\
    . This is an\n      IPX network number unique to the entire internet.  This number\n\
    \      will be a permanently assigned network number for the router.\n      Those\
    \ readers familiar with NetWare 3.x servers should realize\n      that this is\
    \ the \"Internal\" network number.\n"
- title: 'Router Name:'
  contents:
  - "Router Name:\n      Every IPX WAN router must have a \"Router Name\". This is\
    \ a symbolic\n      name given to the router. Its purpose is to allow routers\
    \ to know\n      who they are connected to after link establishment - particularly\n\
    \      for network management purposes.  A symbolic name conveys more\n      information\
    \ to an operator than a set of numbers. The symbolic\n      name should be between\
    \ 1 and 47 characters in length containing\n      the characters 'A' through 'Z',\
    \ underscore (_), hyphen (-) and\n      \"at\" sign (@). The string of characters\
    \ should be followed by a\n      null character (byte of zero) and padded to 48\
    \ characters using\n      the null character.  Those readers familiar with NetWare\
    \ 3.x\n      servers should realize that the file server name is the Router\n\
    \      Name.\n"
- title: 3. IPX WAN Protocol Description
  contents:
  - "3. IPX WAN Protocol Description\n   IPX WAN links have the concept of a LINK\
    \ MASTER and a LINK SLAVE.\n   This relationship is decided upon based on information\
    \ contained\n   within the first IPX packets transferred across the WAN link.\n\
    \   After link establishment, both sides of the link send \"Timer Request\"\n\
    \   packets and start a timer waiting for a \"Timer Response\". These\n   \"Timer\
    \ Request\" packets are sent every 20 seconds until a response is\n   received\
    \ or a time-out occurs trying to initialize a connection (the\n   timer is restarted\
    \ each time a new \"Timer Request\" is sent). The\n   time-out should be configurable,\
    \ and is normally about one minute.\n   This is directly dependent on the call\
    \ setup time for the connection.\n   If a time-out occurs, the router issues a\
    \ disconnect on the offending\n   connection and optionally attempts to retry\
    \ the connection.\n   When a \"Timer Request\" is received, the router with the\
    \ lowest\n   primary network number MUST respond with a \"Timer Response\" packet\
    \ -\n   and become the \"Slave\" of the link. If the \"Slave\" determines that\
    \ it\n   cannot support any of the Routing Types included in the \"Timer\n   Request\"\
    \ packet, the \"Slave\" should issue a disconnect on the\n   connection being\
    \ established. The \"Master\" of the link (determined\n   when a \"Timer Response\"\
    \ packet is received) is responsible for\n   defining the network number that\
    \ is to be used as a common network\n   number for the new WAN link, and for calculating\
    \ the RIP transport\n   time that will be advertized to other RIP routers for\
    \ the new link.\n   This is calculated by stopping the timer which was started\
    \ when a\n   \"Timer Request\" was initiated and applying the algorithm in section\n\
    \   4.2.\n   To allow this, both sides of the link MUST have an adequate pool\
    \ of\n   WAN network numbers (unique within the internetwork) available to be\n\
    \   assigned to the link when the call is fully completed. The \"Master\"\n  \
    \ of the link MUST then select a network number and construct an\n   \"Information\
    \ Request\" packet containing the calculated link delay,\n   the common network\
    \ number, and its own router name. On receiving this\n   packet, the \"Slave\"\
    \ MUST turn the packet around, overwrite the router\n   name and node identifier\
    \ and send an \"Information Response\".\n   After the \"Master\" has received\
    \ the \"Information Response\" and the\n   \"Slave\" has received the \"Information\
    \ Request\", standard IPX RIP and\n   SAP packets are transferred across the WAN\
    \ link, as currently defined\n   for LAN links. The \"IPX Router Specification\"\
    \ [5] contains\n   information describing the Novell RIP/SAP protocol for third\
    \ party\n   developers.\n   Note that the \"Information Request\" and \"Information\
    \ Response\"\n   packets are specific to the \"Routing Type\"=0 information exchanges.\n\
    \   With this routing type, no retransmission is made of any of the\n   Information\
    \ packets. If a response has not been received within the\n   predefined time-out\
    \ period, a disconnect is issued on the link, and\n   the link can optionally\
    \ be attempted later.\n   If a router detects an error for which no suitable protocol\
    \ response\n   exists (e.g., unable to allocate a network number), the link should\n\
    \   be terminated according to the relevant media specification.\n   Under certain\
    \ circumstances, particularly on X.25 permanent circuits,\n   it is only possible\
    \ to detect the remote router went away when it\n   comes back up again.  In this\
    \ case, one side of the link receives a\n   Timer Request packet when IPX is in\
    \ a fully connected state.  The\n   side receiving the Timer Request MUST realize\
    \ that a problem\n   occurred, and revert to the IPX link establishment phase.\n\
    \   Furthermore, the routing information learned from this connection\n   should\
    \ be immediately discarded.\n"
- title: 4. Information Exchange Packet Formats
  contents:
  - "4. Information Exchange Packet Formats\n   All IPX WAN information exchange packets\
    \ conform to the standard\n   Novell IPX packet format. The packets use the IPX\
    \ defined packet type\n   04 defining a Packet Exchange Packet. The socket number\
    \ 0x9004 is a\n   Novell reserved socket number for exclusive use with IPX WAN\n\
    \   information exchange. IPX defines that a network number of 0 is\n   interpreted\
    \ as being a local network of unknown number that requires\n   no routing. This\
    \ feature is of use to us in transferring these\n   packets before the common\
    \ network number is exchanged. Some routers\n   need to know a \"Node Number\"\
    \ (or MAC address) for each node on a\n   link. Node numbers will be formed from\
    \ the \"WNode ID\" field.  The\n   node number will be the 4 bytes of WNode ID\
    \ followed by 2 bytes of\n   zero.\n   Router Type number assignment. Other vendors\
    \ IPX routing protocols\n   can make use of the IPXWAN protocol definition by\
    \ obtaining Router\n   Types from Novell. This document will then include the\
    \ new Router\n   Types (with the references to vendor protocol description documents).\n\
    \   WOption Number assignment. These numbers only need to be assigned\n   from\
    \ Novell for the \"Timer Request\" and \"Timer Response\" packets.\n   Other packet\
    \ types (e.g., the \"Information Request\" packets, are\n   dependent on the \"\
    Router Type\" negotiated and can contain any (vendor\n   defined) packet type\
    \ other than 0 or 1. WOption numbers in these\n   packets are then defined by\
    \ the vendor defining the Routing Type. The\n   same packet format should still\
    \ be maintained.\n"
