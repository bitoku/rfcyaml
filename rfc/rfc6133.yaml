- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes how the Sieve email filtering language\n\
    \   [RFC5228], along with some extensions [RFC5230] [RFC5435] [RFC6134]\n   [RFC6132]\
    \ [RFC6131], can be used to generate automatic replies to\n   incoming electronic\
    \ mail messages based on the presence information\n   of the recipient.  This\
    \ can be used, for example, to inform the\n   sender that messages will not be\
    \ answered immediately because the\n   recipient is busy or away.\n   The auto-reply\
    \ message can additionally be based on information about\n   the sender from the\
    \ recipient's address book, sub-lists therefrom, or\n   other lists available\
    \ to the recipient, so that different senders\n   might get different responses.\
    \  The recipient can create separate\n   rules for friends, family members, colleagues,\
    \ and so on.\n   This can be used in mail filtering software, email-based information\n\
    \   services, and other automatic responder situations.  There are many\n   programs\
    \ currently in use that automatically respond to email.  Some\n   of them send\
    \ many useless or unwanted responses, or send responses to\n   inappropriate addresses.\
    \  The mechanism described herein will help\n   avoid those problems (but see\
    \ the discussion in Section 4).\n   Implementations need to take care of tracking\
    \ previous messages\n   received from the same sender, and they will start or\
    \ stop sending\n   responses as the presence status of the recipient changes.\n\
    \   An important note, though: users of any auto-reply mechanism should\n   really\
    \ think about whether automatic replies are necessary, and at\n   what interval\
    \ they make sense when they are.  Email is not Instant\n   Messaging, and senders\
    \ generally expect that replies might take a\n   while.  Consider whether it's\
    \ truly important to tell people that\n   you'll read their mail in an hour or\
    \ so, or whether that can just be\n   taken as how email works.  There are times\
    \ when this makes sense, but\n   let's not use it to exacerbate information overload.\
    \  Judicious use\n   of appropriate presence information might serve to mitigate\
    \ these\n   issues.\n   Implementors, therefore, need to consider this with respect\
    \ to the\n   features they expose to users, and the potential for inappropriate\n\
    \   use those features represent.  The ability to create auto responders\n   might\
    \ be hidden behind an \"advanced\" button, and users might be\n   warned of the\
    \ consequences and advised of the considerations in the\n   previous paragraph.\n"
- title: 2.  How To Create Auto-Replies
  contents:
  - "2.  How To Create Auto-Replies\n   When an email message arrives, the Sieve script\
    \ can use the\n   notify_method_capability of the Notify extension [RFC5435] to\
    \ check\n   the recipient's presence information.  The Notify-presence extension\n\
    \   [RFC6132] makes additional presence, such as \"away\" and \"do not\n   disturb\"\
    \ status, available.  The script can use the External-lists\n   extension [RFC6134]\
    \ to look the sender up in the recipient's address\n   book or other list.  If\
    \ the information retrieved warrants an auto-\n   reply message, the message can\
    \ then be composed based on that\n   information.\n   The Vacation extension [RFC5230]\
    \ provides an easy way to send the\n   auto-reply message to the sender, as it\
    \ automatically keeps track of\n   the automatic replies and attempts to avoid\
    \ excessive messages and\n   mail loops.  The Vacation-seconds extension [RFC6131]\
    \ allows auto-\n   replies to be sent this way more frequently than once per day,\
    \ when\n   that's appropriate.  (Alternatively, the script can use the Notify\n\
    \   extension [RFC5435] to send a notification by a means other than\n   email.)\n\
    \   Personal and Group Responders can refuse to generate responses except\n  \
    \ to known correspondents or addresses otherwise known to the\n   recipient. \
    \ Such responders can also generate different kinds of\n   responses for \"trusted\"\
    \ vs. \"untrusted\" addresses.  This might be\n   useful, for instance, to avoid\
    \ inappropriate disclosure of personal\n   or confidential information to arbitrary\
    \ addresses.\n"
- title: 3.  Example Use Cases for Auto-Replies
  contents:
  - "3.  Example Use Cases for Auto-Replies\n   1.  In this example, we check that\
    \ the envelope \"from\" is in the\n       recipient's address book [RFC6134] and\
    \ that the recipient's\n       presence shows \"extended away\" [RFC6132].  If\
    \ both of those are\n       true, the \"vacation\" action [RFC5230] is used to\
    \ send an auto-\n       reply, making sure we don't reply to the same sender more\
    \ than\n       once every half hour [RFC6131].  The variables extension\n    \
    \   [RFC5229] is used to extract the value of the recipient's\n       natural-language\
    \ presence status message, which will be used as\n       the response to the sender.\n\
    \   require [\"envelope\", \"extlists\", \"enotify\", \"variables\",\n       \
    \     \"vacation-seconds\"];\n   if allof (\n       envelope :list \"from\" \"\
    :addrbook:default\",\n       notify_method_capability \"xmpp:me@example.com\"\
    \ \"show\" \"xa\"\n     ) {\n       # :matches \"*\" is used here to extract the\
    \ value\n       if notify_method_capability :matches\n           \"xmpp:myjid@example.com\"\
    \ \"status\" \"*\" {\n         set \"resp_msg\" \"${1}\";\n       } else {\n \
    \        set \"resp_msg\" \"Away for a while, without access to email.\";\n  \
    \     }\n       vacation :handle \"ext-away\" :seconds 1800 \"${resp_msg}\";\n\
    \     }\n   2.  In the next example, we'll check for the recipient's personal\n\
    \       assistant, and give very detailed information about the\n       recipient's\
    \ status to that sender.  For other senders in the\n       \"family\" and \"friends\"\
    \ lists, we'll also send an auto-reply.\n       Other senders will be considered\
    \ less important, and don't need\n       auto-replies.\n   require [\"envelope\"\
    , \"extlists\", \"enotify\", \"vacation-seconds\"];\n   if envelope :is \"from\"\
    \ \"assistant@example.com\"\n     {\n       if notify_method_capability \"xmpp:me@example.com\"\
    \ \"show\" \"away\"\n         {\n           vacation :handle \"away\" :seconds\
    \ 600\n               \"I'm away for now, but I'll be back soon.\";\n        \
    \ }\n       elsif notify_method_capability \"xmpp:me@example.com\" \"show\" \"\
    dnd\"\n         {\n           vacation :handle \"dnd\" :seconds 1800\n       \
    \        \"I'm not to be disturbed.  I'll check mail later.\";\n         }\n \
    \      elsif notify_method_capability \"xmpp:me@example.com\" \"show\" \"xa\"\n\
    \         {\n           vacation :handle \"ext-away\" :seconds 3600\n        \
    \       \"I'm away for a while, without access to email.\";\n         }\n    \
    \   elsif notify_method_capability \"xmpp:me@example.com\" \"busy\" \"yes\"\n\
    \         {\n           vacation :handle \"busy\" :seconds 1800\n            \
    \   \"I'm very busy, but might check email now and then.\";\n         }\n    \
    \ }\n   elsif envelope :list \"from\" [\":addrbook:family\",\n               \
    \                 \":addrbook:friends\"]\n     {\n       if notify_method_capability\
    \ \"xmpp:me@example.com\" \"show\"\n              [\"away\", \"dnd\", \"xa\"]\n\
    \         {\n           vacation :handle \"away\" :seconds 3600\n            \
    \   \"I'm not available to respond to email.\";\n         }\n     }\n   else\n\
    \     { # We could respond as below, making it only once a day\n       # for less\
    \ important senders.  Better to just omit\n       # that, though (see the end\
    \ of the Introduction section).\n       #\n       # vacation :handle \"catchall\"\
    \ :days 1\n       #     \"I got your message, and might read it eventually.\"\
    ;\n     }\n   3.  For this example, if the sender is a work colleague and the\n\
    \       recipient is on extended away status, then reply with a message\n    \
    \   giving alternative contact information.  The message might also\n       include\
    \ details about the reason for the absence, or other\n       personal or confidential\
    \ information that shouldn't be shared\n       with senders who aren't associated\
    \ with the recipient's company.\n   require [\"envelope\", \"extlists\", \"enotify\"\
    , \"vacation\"];\n   if envelope :list \"from\" \":addrbook:co-workers\"\n   \
    \  {\n       if notify_method_capability \"xmpp:me@example.com\" \"show\" \"xa\"\
    \n         {\n           vacation :handle \"bigtrip\" :days 3\n              \
    \ \"I'm on an extended business trip to Texas for the Foo\n                project.\
    \  Contact my backup, Susan <susan@example.com>,\n                or call my assistant\
    \ on +1 666 555 1234 if you urgently\n                need to contact me.\";\n\
    \         }\n     }\n   4.  This example is used to send an acknowledgment to\
    \ every message\n       received.  A :seconds value of zero is used to reply to\
    \ every\n       message, with no removal of duplicates to the same sender.  This\n\
    \       requires that the Sieve engine allow an interval of zero; if it\n    \
    \   does not, and it imposes a minimum value, not every message will\n       receive\
    \ an auto-reply.\n   require [\"envelope\", \"extlists\", \"vacation-seconds\"\
    ];\n   if not envelope :list \"from\" \":addrbook:staff\"\n     {\n       vacation\
    \ :handle \"auto-resp\" :seconds 0\n           \"Your request has been received.\
    \  A service\n            representative will contact you as soon as\n       \
    \     possible, usually within one business day.\";\n     }\n   5.  This example\
    \ uses the same structure to automatically send a copy\n       of each incoming\
    \ message to the recipient's backup, if the sender\n       is a customer contact\
    \ or co-worker, or if the message's subject\n       includes the word \"urgent\"\
    .\n   require [\"envelope\", \"extlists\", \"enotify\"];\n   if anyof (\n    \
    \   envelope :list \"from\" [\":addrbook:customers\",\n                      \
    \        \":addrbook:co-workers\"],\n       header :contains \"subject\" \"urgent\"\
    \n     ) {\n       if notify_method_capability \"xmpp:me@example.com\" \"show\"\
    \ \"xa\"\n         {\n           redirect \"susan@example.com\"; # send a copy\
    \ to my backup\n           keep; # also keep a copy for myself\n         }\n \
    \    }\n   }\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   See the Security Considerations sections of the\
    \ following\n   specifications for discussion of security considerations not covered\n\
    \   here:\n   o  Sieve base specification [RFC5228]\n   o  Sieve Vacation extension\
    \ [RFC5230]\n   o  Vacation \"Seconds\" parameter [RFC6131]\n   o  Sieve Externally\
    \ Stored Lists extension [RFC6134]\n   o  Sieve Notify extension [RFC5435] (and\
    \ any applicable notification\n      methods)\n   This document describes how\
    \ to set up a system that creates automatic\n   replies in an intelligent way.\
    \  Despite the \"intelligence\", errors in\n   scripts can result in too many\
    \ auto-reply messages, especially when\n   the reply interval is minimal (using\
    \ the \"notify\" action, or the\n   \"vacation\" action with a small value for\
    \ \":seconds\").\n   Despite the \"intelligence\", too, errors in scripts can\
    \ result in\n   private information getting to senders inappropriately.  In example\
    \ 3\n   in Section 3, for instance, if the :list test checks the wrong list,\n\
    \   or none at all, information about the recipient's business trip might\n  \
    \ be sent to someone who has no need to know about it, and that\n   information\
    \ should not have been sent.\n   Even without errors in scripts, a sender who\
    \ recognizes that auto-\n   replies are dependent upon the recipient's presence\
    \ can use that fact\n   to probe the presence information.  One result of that\
    \ can be that\n   the sender discerns changes in the recipient's presence that\
    \ the\n   sender would normally not be allowed to see, making this an\n   unintentional\
    \ back door into the user's presence information.\n   Another result is that this\
    \ can create a \"covert channel\", allowing\n   the recipient to send information\
    \ to a sender by changing his\n   presence information, his address book, and/or\
    \ his Sieve script\n   (though in this regard, the exposure is comparable to any\
    \ other case\n   of shared presence information).\n   An auto responder can cause\
    \ leaks of other pieces of information,\n   including potentially providing the\
    \ ability to attack cryptographic\n   keying material.  For example, using the\
    \ time it takes to perform a\n   cryptographic operation, an attacker may obtain\
    \ information about the\n   secret key.  An auto responder that doesn't take timing\
    \ into account\n   could accidentally leak this kind of information.\n   Moreover,\
    \ if an auto responder script directly returns the results of\n   a cryptographic\
    \ operation, that could also provide an attack vector.\n   For example, if a script\
    \ returns the results of a decryption\n   operation, an attacker can send an arbitrarily\
    \ encrypted message and\n   use the results as a chosen cyphertext attack to decode\
    \ the\n   encryption key.  Authors of scripts should be careful about what\n \
    \  information they return to senders.\n"
