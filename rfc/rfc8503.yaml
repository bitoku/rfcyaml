  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC6513], [RFC6514], and [RFC6625] specify procedures for\
    \ supporting\n   multicast in Multiprotocol Label Switching/Border Gateway Protocol\n\
    \   (MPLS/BGP) Layer 3 (IP) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).  Throughout\n   this\
    \ document, we will use the term \"MVPN\" (for \"multicast VPN\")\n   [RFC6513]\
    \ to refer to a BGP/MPLS IP VPN that supports multicast.\n   Provider Edge (PE)\
    \ routers that attach to a particular MVPN exchange\n   customer multicast (C-multicast)\
    \ routing information with neighboring\n   PEs.  In [RFC6513], two basic methods\
    \ for exchanging C-multicast\n   routing information are defined: (1) Protocol\
    \ Independent Multicast\n   (PIM) [RFC7761] and (2) BGP.\n   In the rest of this\
    \ document, we will use the term \"PIM-MVPN\" to\n   refer to the case where PIM\
    \ is used for exchanging C-multicast\n   routing information and \"BGP-MVPN\"\
    \ to refer to the case where BGP is\n   used for exchanging C-multicast routing\
    \ information.\n   This document describes managed objects to configure and/or\
    \ monitor\n   MVPNs.  Most of the managed objects are common to both PIM-MVPN\
    \ and\n   BGP-MVPN, and some managed objects are BGP-MVPN specific.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   This document adopts the definitions, abbreviations, and\
    \ mechanisms\n   described in [RFC4364], [RFC6513], and [RFC6514].  Familiarity\
    \ with\n   multicast, MPLS, Layer 3 (L3) VPN, and MVPN concepts and/or\n   mechanisms\
    \ is assumed.  Some terms specifically related to this\n   document are explained\
    \ below.\n   An MVPN can be realized by using various kinds of transport\n   mechanisms\
    \ for forwarding a packet to all or a subset of PEs across\n   service provider\
    \ networks.  Such transport mechanisms are referred to\n   as provider tunnels\
    \ (P-tunnels).\n   A Provider Multicast Service Interface (PMSI) [RFC6513] is\
    \ a\n   conceptual interface instantiated by a P-tunnel.  A PE uses a PMSI to\n\
    \   send customer multicast traffic to all or some PEs in the same VPN.\n   There\
    \ are two kinds of PMSIs: Inclusive PMSI (I-PMSI) and Selective\n   PMSI (S-PMSI)\
    \ [RFC6513].  An I-PMSI enables a PE attached to a\n   particular MVPN to transmit\
    \ a message to all PEs in the same MVPN.\n   An S-PMSI enables a PE to transmit\
    \ a message to a selected set of PEs\n   in the same MVPN.\n   As described in\
    \ [RFC4382], each PE maintains one default forwarding\n   table and zero or more\
    \ Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) tables.\n   Throughout this document, we\
    \ will use the term \"MVRF\" (for \"multicast\n   VRF\") to refer to a VRF that\
    \ contains multicast routing information.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be\
    \ interpreted as described in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when,\
    \ they appear in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"

  - "2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of\
    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\
    \ please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are\
    \ accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information\
    \ Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network\
    \ Management Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms\
    \ defined in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies\
    \ a MIB\n   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n\
    \   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This MIB module contains some read-only objects\
    \ that may be deemed\n   sensitive.  It also contains some read-write objects\
    \ whose settings\n   will change the device's MVPN-related behavior.  Appropriate\
    \ security\n   procedures that are related to SNMP in general but are not specific\n\
    \   to this MIB module need to be implemented by concerned operators.\n   There\
    \ are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS\
    \ clause of read-write.  Such objects may be\n   considered sensitive or vulnerable\
    \ in some network environments.  The\n   support for SET operations in a non-secure\
    \ environment without proper\n   protection opens devices to attack.  These are\
    \ the tables and objects\n   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   o  mvpnSPTunnelLimit\n\
    \      The value of this object is used to control the maximum number of\n   \
    \   selective provider tunnels that a PE allows for a particular MVPN.\n     \
    \ Access to this object may be abused to impact the performance of\n      the\
    \ PE or prevent the PE from having new selective provider\n      tunnels.\n  \
    \ o  mvpnBgpCmcastRouteWithdrawalTimer\n      The value of this object is used\
    \ to control the delay for the\n      advertisement of withdrawals of C-multicast\
    \ routes.  Access to\n      this object may be abused to impact the performance\
    \ of a PE.\n   o  mvpnBgpSrcSharedTreeJoinTimer\n      The value of this object\
    \ is used to control the delay for the\n      advertisement of Source/Shared Tree\
    \ Join C-multicast routes.\n      Access to this object may be abused to impact\
    \ the propagation of\n      C-multicast routing information.\n   o  mvpnBgpMsgRateLimit\n\
    \      The value of this object is used to control the upper bound for\n     \
    \ the rate of BGP C-multicast routing information message exchange\n      among\
    \ PEs.  Access to this object may be abused to impact the\n      performance of\
    \ the PE or disrupt the C-multicast routing\n      information message exchange\
    \ using BGP.\n   o  mvpnBgpMaxSpmsiAdRoutes\n      The value of this object is\
    \ used to control the upper bound for\n      the number of S-PMSI A-D routes.\
    \  Access to this object may be\n      abused to impact the performance of the\
    \ PE or prevent the PE from\n      receiving S-PMSI A-D routes.\n   o  mvpnBgpMaxSpmsiAdRouteFreq\n\
    \      The value of this object is used to control the upper bound for\n     \
    \ the frequency of S-PMSI A-D route generation.  Access to this\n      object\
    \ may be abused to impact the performance of the PE or\n      prevent the PE from\
    \ generating new S-PMSI A-D routes.\n   o  mvpnBgpMaxSrcActiveAdRoutes\n     \
    \ The value of this object is used to control the upper bound for\n      the number\
    \ of Source Active A-D routes.  Access to this object may\n      be abused to\
    \ impact the performance of the PE or prevent the PE\n      from receiving Source\
    \ Active A-D routes.\n   o  mvpnBgpMaxSrcActiveAdRouteFreq\n      The value of\
    \ this object is used to control the upper bound for\n      the frequency of Source\
    \ Active A-D route generation.  Access to\n      this object may be abused to\
    \ impact the performance of the PE or\n      prevent the PE from generating new\
    \ Source Active A-D routes.\n   Some of the objects in this MIB module may be\
    \ considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.  This includes\
    \ INDEX objects\n   with a MAX-ACCESS of not-accessible, and any indices from\
    \ other\n   modules exposed via AUGMENTS.  It is thus important to control even\n\
    \   GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even\n   encrypt\
    \ the values of these objects when sending them over the\n   network via SNMP.\
    \  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n\
    \   o  The address-related objects in this MIB module may have impact on\n   \
    \   privacy and security.  These objects may reveal the locations of\n      senders\
    \ and recipients.\n      *  mvpnPmsiTunnelPimGroupAddr\n      *  mvpnSpmsiCmcastGroupAddr\n\
    \      *  mvpnSpmsiCmcastSourceAddr\n      *  mvpnAdvtPeerAddr\n      *  mvpnMrouteCmcastGroupAddr\n\

    \      *  mvpnMrouteRtAddr\n      *  mvpnMrouteNextHopGroupAddr\n      *  mvpnMrouteNextHopSourceAddrs\n\
    \      *  mvpnMrouteNextHopAddr\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include\
    \ adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by\
    \ using IPsec),\n   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed\
    \ to\n   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this\n\
    \   MIB module.\n   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described\
    \ by the\n   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming\n\
    \   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for\n   authentication\
    \ and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)\n   [RFC3414] with the AES\
    \ cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations\n   MAY also provide support for\
    \ the Transport Security Model (TSM)\n   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure\
    \ transport such as SSH\n   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].\n   Further, deployment\
    \ of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED\
    \ to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n\
    \   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance\
    \ of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects\
    \ only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET\
    \ or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"
