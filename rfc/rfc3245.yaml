    \ below), specifically its group working\n   on \"Questions 1 and 2\", and members\
    \ of the IETF and\n   telecommunications communities, Scott Bradner, as Area Director\n\
    \   responsible for the ENUM work and ISOC Vice President for Standards,\n   initiated\
    \ an effort to produce explanations of the decisions made by\n   the IETF about\

  - "2.2. The need for a single root in the DNS\n   In the Domain Name System (DNS),\
    \ each domain name is globally unique.\n   This is a fundamental fact in the DNS\
    \ system and follows\n   mathematically from the structure of that system as well\
    \ as the\n   resource identification requirements of the Internet.  Which DNS\n\
    \   server is authoritative for a specific domain is defined by\n   delegations\
    \ from the parent domain, and this is repeated recursively\n   until the so-called\
    \ root zone, which is handled by a well-known set\n   of DNS servers.  Note that\
    \ words like \"authoritative\" and\n   \"delegation\" and their variations are\
    \ used here in their specific,\n   technical, DNS sense and may not have the same\
    \ meanings they normally\n   would in an ITU context.\n   Given that one starts\
    \ with the well-known root zone, every party\n   querying the DNS system will\
    \ end up at the same set of servers for\n   the same domain, regardless of who\
    \ is sending the query, when the\n   query is sent and where in the network the\
    \ query is initiated.  In\n   May 2000 the IAB published a document on the need\
    \ for a single root\n   in the DNS.  This document explores the issues in greater\
    \ detail.\n   See RFC 2826 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2826.txt).\n"
- title: 2.3. Storing E.164 numbers in the DNS
  contents:
  - "2.3. Storing E.164 numbers in the DNS\n   An E.164 number is also globally unique,\
    \ and because of that it has\n   most of the same properties as a domain name.\
    \  This was the reason\n   why storing E.164 numbers in the DNS system is technically\
    \ a simple\n   mapping.  ENUM is just that, a way to store E.164 numbers in the\
    \ DNS.\n   Multiple ENUM trees in the DNS hierarchy would have the telephony\n\
    \   equivalent of permitting every carrier to assign a different meaning\n   to\
    \ an E.164 country code, with each one potentially mapping a given\n   number\
    \ to a different circuit or rejecting it entirely.  For the\n   Internet, if there\
    \ were multiple trees, there would be no way to\n   determine which domains might\
    \ contain ENUM records.  Thus, each\n   application that uses ENUM facilities\
    \ would have to be manually\n   configured with a list of domains to be searched.\
    \  This would incur\n   the same problems of scaling and updates that led to the\
    \ development\n   of the DNS.\n   The goal with ENUM is that one party should\
    \ be able to look up\n   information in DNS, which another party has stored in\
    \ DNS.  This must\n   be possible with only the E.164 number as input to the algorithm.\n\
    \   If the party storing information in DNS has two (or more) places to\n   choose\
    \ from, and chooses one of them, how is a second party looking\n   up things to\
    \ know what place was selected?  An analogy would be if\n   one knew only www.whitehouse,\
    \ and not the TLD, and ask people to go\n   to that website.  Is the correct domain\
    \ name www.whitehouse.gov,\n   www.whitehouse.com or www.whitehouse.se?  It should\
    \ be noted that\n   www.whitehouse.com exists and is a pornography site.\n   Thus,\
    \ the only way of knowing where to look up E.164/ENUM numbers in\n   DNS is to\
    \ use one and only one domain, and have everyone agree on\n   what that domain\
    \ is.  Note that ENUM is a system for use with E.164\n   numbers in their general,\
    \ global, context.  Nothing technical can, or\n   should, try to prevent parties\
    \ that wish to use ENUM-like mechanisms,\n   or other systems that have the same\
    \ general structure as telephone\n   numbers, from working out private, out of\
    \ band, agreements to support\n   those applications.  However, such applications\
    \ are neither E.164 nor\n   ENUM, any more than internal extension numbers in\
    \ a PBX are normally\n   considered to be part of either.\n"

- title: 3.2. IAB Statement on Infrastructure Domain and Subdomains
  contents:
  - "3.2. IAB Statement on Infrastructure Domain and Subdomains\n   (Taken from http://www.iab.org/iab/DOCUMENTS/iab-arpa-stmt.txt,\
    \ May\n   2000.)\n   Over the last several months, the IAB has been reviewing,\
    \ and\n   discussing with ICANN and other parties, the handling of various\n \
    \  Internet Protocol-related infrastructure components that the\n   community\
    \ has concluded should be placed into the DNS.\n   Historically, the most visible\
    \ infrastructure domain has been the\n   IPv4 address reverse-mapping domain.\
    \  This domain was placed in \"in-\n   addr.arpa\" as part of the initial ARPANET\
    \ transition strategy from\n   host table naming (see RFC 881-http://www.ietf.org/rfc/\
    \ rfc0881.txt).\n   Other than the IPv4 reverse-mapping subdomain, it became the\
    \ only\n   active subdomain of that domain as the <host-table-name>.ARPA names\n\
    \   that were also part of the transition were gradually removed.  Other\n   infrastructure\
    \ domains were, in the past, placed under the \"INT\" TLD\n   and various organizational\
    \ names.\n   It is in the interest of general Internet stability, to pay adequate\n\
    \   attention to the placement of secondary DNS servers, and\n   administrative\
    \ cleanliness, to start rationalizing this situation by\n   locating new infrastructure\
    \ subdomains in a single domain and\n   migrating existing ones to it as appropriate.\
    \  It appears that our\n   original infrastructure domain \"ARPA\", redesignated\
    \ from an\n   abbreviation for \"ARPANET\" to an acronym for \"Address and Routing\n\
    \   Parameters Area\" is best suited for this purpose.\n"
- title: 3.3. Infrastructure subdomains
  contents:
  - "3.3. Infrastructure subdomains\n   Operationally, it is easier to ensure good\
    \ stability for DNS in\n   general if we have as few DNS zones as possible that\
    \ are used for\n   parameters for infrastructure purposes.  Today, new infrastructure\n\
    \   domains are put in ARPA and old assignments which were made in other\n   domains\
    \ are being migrated to ARPA.  Currently, ARPA is used for in-\n   addr.arpa (for\
    \ reverse mapping of IPv4 addresses), ip6.arpa, (for\n   reverse mapping of IPv6\
    \ addresses), and e164.arpa, (the subject of\n   this memo).  In the future, URI\
    \ schemes, URN namespaces and other new\n   address families will be stored in\
    \ ARPA.\n   Theoretically, each set of infrastructure parameters could be stored\n\
    \   in a separate domain as a TLD.  (For example, .URI, .UNI, .IPV6, new\n   TLD,\
    \ which only can be created via the ICANN process (which might\n   take a year\
    \ or more) and would unnecessarily and undesirably flatten\n   the DNS tree. \
    \ It is much easier to have one TLD with easily created\n   new subdomains (2nd\
    \ level domains), one for each parameter.  Thus it\n   was logical to store E.164\
    \ numbers in ARPA.\n"
- title: 3.4. The ARPA domain (derived from RFC 3172, September 2001)
  contents:
  - "3.4. The ARPA domain (derived from RFC 3172, September 2001)\n   The \"arpa\"\
    \ domain was originally established as part of the initial\n   deployment of the\
    \ DNS, to provide a transition mechanism from the\n   Host Tables that were previously\
    \ standard in the ARPANET.  It was\n   also used to provide a permanent home for\
    \ IPv4 address to name\n   mappings (\"reverse mappings\") which were previously\
    \ also handled\n   using the Host Table mechanism.  The Internet Architecture\
    \ Board\n   (IAB), in cooperation with the Internet Corporation for Assigned\n\
    \   Names and Numbers (ICANN), is currently responsible for managing the\n   Top\
    \ Level Domain (TLD) name \"arpa\".  This arrangement is documented\n   in Appendix\
    \ A of RFC 3172.  This domain name provides the root of the\n   name hierarchy\
    \ of the reverse mapping of IP addresses to domain\n   names.  More generally,\
    \ this domain name undertakes a role as a\n   limited use domain for Internet\
    \ infrastructure applications, by\n   providing a name root for the mapping of\
    \ particular protocol values\n   to names of service entities.  This domain name\
    \ provides a name root\n   for the mapping of protocol values into lookup keys\
    \ to retrieve\n   operationally critical protocol infrastructure data records\
    \ or\n   objects for the Internet.\n   The IAB may add other infrastructure uses\
    \ to the \"arpa\" domain in the\n   future.  Any such additions or changes will\
    \ be in accordance with the\n   procedures documented in Section 2.1 and Section\
    \ 3 of this document.\n   [referring to RFC 3172] This domain is termed an \"\
    infrastructure\n   domain\", as its role is to support the operating infrastructure\
    \ of\n   the Internet.  In particular, the \"arpa\" domain is not to be used in\n\
    \   the same manner (e.g., for naming hosts) as other generic Top Level\n   Domains\
    \ are commonly used.\n   The operational administration of this domain, in accordance\
    \ with the\n   provisions described in this document, shall be performed by the\
    \ IANA\n   under the terms of the MoU between the IAB and ICANN concerning the\n\
    \   IANA [RFC 2860].\n"

  - "3.5. Assignment of the .ARPA top level domain\n   As documented in appendix A\
    \ of RFC 3172, on April 28, 2000 the US\n   Department of Commerce, acting under\
    \ the authority of its purchase\n   order with ICANN, directed ICANN to operate\

  contents:
  - "3.6. Name Server Requirements for .ARPA (from RFC 3172)\n   As this domain is\
    \ part of the operationally critical infrastructure\n   of the Internet, the stability,\
    \ integrity and efficiency of the\n   operation of this domain is a matter of\
    \ importance for all Internet\n   users.\n   The \"arpa\" domain is positioned\
    \ as a top level domain in order to\n   avoid potential operational instabilities\
    \ caused by multiple DNS\n   lookups spanning several operational domains that\
    \ would be required\n   to locate the servers of each of the parent names of a\
    \ more deeply\n   nested infrastructure name.  The maximal lookup set for ARPA\
    \ is a\n   lookup of the name servers for the \"arpa\" domain from a root server,\n\
    \   and the query agent is then provided with a list of authoritative\n   \"arpa\"\
    \ name servers.\n   The efficient and correct operation of the \"arpa\" domain\
    \ is\n   considered to be sufficiently critical that the operational\n   requirements\
    \ for the root servers apply to the operational\n   requirements of the \"arpa\"\
    \ servers.  All operational requirements\n   noted in RFC 2870, as they apply\

    \ the \"arpa\" servers.\n   Many of the servers that are authoritative for the\
    \ root zone (or the\n   \".\" zone) also currently serve as authoritative for\
    \ the \"arpa\" zone.\n   As noted in RFC 2870, this arrangement is likely to change\

- title: '3.7. Summary: ENUM use of .ARPA'
  contents:
  - "3.7. Summary: ENUM use of .ARPA\n   The ARPA domain is the preferred TLD for\
    \ infrastructure and parameter\n   use.  The ENUM structure should be placed in\
    \ a single domain subtree\n   (see separate contribution, COM 2-11), and is expected\
    \ to evolve into\n   important Internet infrastructure, and hence should be placed\
    \ there.\n   This decision is facilitated by the MOU between ICANN and IETF and\n\
    \   the instructions from the US Government to ICANN, which provide for\n   IAB\
    \ supervision of that domain.  Despite some confusion with the name\n   of a US\
    \ Department of Defense agency, DARPA, these uses are\n   consistent with all\
    \ of the historical uses of the ARPA domain, which\n   have been for infrastructure\
    \ purposes (initially when the\n   hierarchical DNS was created to replace the\
    \ old flat namespace of\n   ARPANET): the domain was never used for any internal\
    \ or specific\n   DARPA purpose.  Recognizing the potential difficulties with\
    \ multiple\n   infrastructure domains, the Internet Architecture Board concluded\
    \ in\n   May 2000 that all new infrastructure information was to be stored in\n\
    \   the ARPA domain and existing infrastructure subtrees migrated there\n   as\
    \ feasible.  http://www.iab.org/iab/DOCUMENTS/iab-arpa-stmt.txt\n   provides additional\
    \ context for these decisions.\n   The ENUM Working Group decided to follow that\

    \   infrastructure services require that their servers be operated with\n   the\
    \ same level of attention to reliability and security that the root\n   servers\
    \ require.  In addition, for an infrastructure service such as\n   E164.ARPA some\
    \ additional requirements were felt by the IAB to be\n   important.  Organizations\
