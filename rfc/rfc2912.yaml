  - "1. Introduction\n   In \"A Syntax for Describing Media Feature Sets\" [1], an\
    \ expression\n   format is presented for describing media feature capabilities\
    \ as a\n   combination of simple media feature tags, registered according to\n\
    \   \"Media Feature Tag Registration Procedure\" [2].  This provides a\n   format\
    \ for message handling agents to describe the media feature\n   content of messages\
    \ that they can handle.\n   This memo defines a MIME 'Content-features:' header\
    \ that can be used\n   to annotate a MIME message part using these feature expressions.\n\
    \   This header provides a means to indicate media-related features of\n   message\
    \ content that go beyond the MIME content type.\n   Consideration is also given\
    \ to how it may be used to present message\n   media content information that\
    \ is problematic to express within the\n   basic MIME framework.\n"

    \ a conformant\n         implementation, but may help those who wish to understand\
    \ the\n         design in greater depth.\n"
- title: 2. Motivation and goals
  contents:
  - "2. Motivation and goals\n   It is envisaged that media feature labelling of message\
    \ parts may be\n   used in the following ways:\n   o  to supply more detailed\
    \ media feature information about a message\n      content than can be provided\
    \ by the 'Content-type:' header.\n   o  to provide summary media feature information\
    \ (possibly including\n      MIME content types) about the content of a composite\
    \ MIME message\n      part (e.g. 'multipart' or 'message'), without having to\
    \ open up\n      the inner content of the message.\n   o  to supply media feature\
    \ information about external data referenced\n      by a message part (e.g. 'message/external-body'\
    \ MIME type).  This\n      information would not be available by examination of\
    \ the message\n      content.\n   o  to describe the content of a message that\
    \ is encrypted or encoded\n      using some application-specific file structure\
    \ that hides the\n      content from a MIME processor.  This information also\
    \ would not be\n      generally available by examination of the message content.\n"
- title: 3. The 'Content-features:' MIME header
  contents:
  - "3. The 'Content-features:' MIME header\n   A new header field is defined that\
    \ extends the allowable formats for\n   'optional-field' [4] with the following\
    \ syntax:\n      optional-field =/ \"Content-features\" \":\" Feature-expr\n \
    \     Feature-expr   =  filter      ; See [1], section 4.1\n   where 'filter'\
    \ is the media feature expression format defined by \"A\n   Syntax for Describing\
    \ Media Feature Sets\" [1].\n   This header provides additional information about\
    \ the message content\n   directly contained or indirectly referenced in the corresponding\
    \ MIME\n   message part.\n"
- title: 3.1 Whitespace and folding long headers
  contents:
  - "3.1 Whitespace and folding long headers\n   In some circumstances, media feature\
    \ expressions can be very long.\n   According to \"A Syntax for Describing Media\
    \ Feature Sets\" [1],\n   whitespace is allowed between lexical elements of a\
    \ media feature\n   expression.  Further, RFC822/MIME [4,5] allows folding of\
    \ long\n   headers at points where whitespace appears to avoid line length\n \
    \  restrictions.\n   Therefore, it is recommended that whitespace is included\
    \ as\n   permitted, especially in long media feature expressions, to\n   facilitate\
    \ the folding of headers by agents that do not otherwise\n   understand the syntax\
    \ of this field.\n"

- title: 3.2.1 Simple message parts
  contents:
  - "3.2.1 Simple message parts\n   When applied to a simple MIME message part, the\
    \ header should appear\n   just once and is used to convey additional information\
    \ about the\n   message part content that goes beyond that provided by the MIME\n\
    \   'Content-type:' header field.  The 'Content-features:' header may\n   indicate\
    \ a content type that is different than that given by the MIME\n   'Content-type:'\
    \ header.  This is possible but not recommended when\n   applied to a non-composite\
    \ body part:  in any case, MIME content type\n   processing must be performed\
    \ in accordance with the 'Content-type:'\n   header.\n         NOTE:  Once the\
    \ message content has been delivered to an\n         application, it is possible\
    \ that subsequent processing may be\n         affected by content type information\
    \ indicated by the media\n         feature expression.  See example 4.5 below.\n"
- title: 3.2.2 Multipart and other composites
  contents:
  - "3.2.2 Multipart and other composites\n   'Content-features:' headers may be applied\
    \ to a MIME multipart\n   indicating information about the inner content of the\
    \ multipart.\n   Implementations must not assume a one-to-one relationship between\n\
    \   'Content-features' headers and contained body parts.  Headers may\n   appear\
    \ on a containing multipart wrapper in a different order than\n   the body parts\
    \ to which they refer;  a single header may refer to\n   more than one contained\
    \ body part;  several headers may refer to the\n   same contained body part.\n\
    \   If it is important to relate specific media features to specific\n   contained\
    \ MIME body parts, then the 'Content-features:' header should\n   be applied directly\
    \ to the body part concerned, rather than the\n   surrounding composite.\n   \
    \      NOTE:  The intent here is to allow summary media feature\n         information\
    \ to be provided without having to open up and\n         examine the inner content\
    \ of the MIME message.\n   Similar usage may apply when the message format is\
    \ a non-MIME or\n   opaque composite;  e.g. 'application/zip', or an encrypted\
    \ message.\n   In these cases, the option of examining the message content to\n\
    \   discover media feature information is not available.\n"
- title: 3.2.3 Reference to external data
  contents:
  - "3.2.3 Reference to external data\n   Media feature information about data indirectly\
    \ referenced by a MIME\n   body part rather than contained within a message can\
    \ be conveyed\n   using one or more 'Content-features:' headers.\n   For example,\
    \ media information --including contained MIME content\n   type(s)-- about the\
    \ data referenced by a MIME 'Message/external-body'\n   may be conveyed.\n"

- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   When applied to simple or multipart MIME formatted\
    \ data, a media\n   feature expression provides summary information about the\
    \ message\n   data, which in many cases can be determined by examination of the\n\
    \   message content.  Under these circumstances, no additional security\n   considerations\
    \ appear to be raised.\n   When applied to other message composites, especially\
    \ encrypted\n   message content, feature expressions may disclose information\
    \ that is\n   otherwise unavailable.  In these cases, some security considerations\n\
    \   associated with media content negotiation [1,2] may have greater\n   relevance.\n\
    \   It is suggested here that media feature descriptions may be usefully\n   employed\
    \ with encrypted message content.  In doing this, take care to\n   ensure that\
    \ the purpose of encryption is not compromised  (e.g.\n   encryption might be\
    \ intended to conceal the fact that a particular\n   application data format is\
    \ being used, which fact might be disclosed\n   by an injudiciously applied Content-features\
    \ header).\n   If a 'Content-features' header is applied to a multipart/signed\n\
    \   object (or indeed outside any other form of signed data) the media\n   feature\
    \ information is not protected.  This unprotected information\n   could be tampered\
    \ with, possibly fooling implementations into doing\n   inappropriate things with\
    \ the contained material.  (Putting the media\n   feature information inside the\
    \ signed information would overcome\n   this, at the cost of requiring implementations\
    \ to parse the inner\n   structure to find it.)\n"
