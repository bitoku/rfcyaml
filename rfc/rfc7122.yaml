  - "1.  Introduction\n   DTN communication protocols include the Bundle Protocol\
    \ described in\n   RFC 5050 [RFC5050], which provides transmission of application\
    \ data\n   blocks (\"bundles\") through optional intermediate custody transfer,\n\
    \   and the Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) -- LTP Motivation\n   [RFC5325],\
    \ LTP Specification [RFC5326], and LTP Security [RFC5327] --\n   which can be\
    \ used to transmit bundles reliably and efficiently over a\n   point-to-point\
    \ link.  It is often desirable to test these protocols\n   over Internet Protocol\
    \ links.  \"Delay Tolerant Networking TCP\n   Convergence Layer Protocol\" [CLAYER]\
    \ defines a method for\n   transporting bundles over TCP.  This document specifies\
    \ the preferred\n   method for transmitting either bundles or LTP blocks across\
    \ the\n   Internet using datagrams in place of TCP.  Figure 1 shows the general\n\
    \   protocol layering described in the DTN documents.  DTN Applications\n   interact\
    \ with the Bundle Protocol Layer, which in turn uses a\n   Convergence Layer to\
    \ prepare a bundle for transmission.  The\n   Convergence Layer will typically\
    \ rely on a lower-level protocol to\n   carry out the transmission.\n        \

- title: 2.  General Recommendation
  contents:
  - "2.  General Recommendation\n   In order to utilize DTN protocols across the Internet,\
    \ whether for\n   testing purposes or as part of a larger network path, it is\
    \ necessary\n   to encapsulate them into a standard Internet Protocol so that\
    \ they\n   travel easily across the Internet.  This is particularly true for\n\
    \   LTP, which provides no endpoint addressing.  This encapsulation\n   choice\
    \ needs to be made carefully in order to avoid redundancy, since\n   DTN protocols\
    \ may provide their own reliability mechanisms.\n   Congestion control is vital\
    \ to the continued functioning of the\n   Internet, particularly for situations\
    \ where data will be sent at\n   arbitrarily fast data rates.  The Bundle Protocol\
    \ delegates provision\n   of reliable delivery and, implicitly, congestion control\
    \ to the\n   convergence layer used (Section 7.2 of RFC 5050 [RFC5050]).  In\n\
    \   situations where TCP will work effectively in communications between\n   pairs\
    \ of DTN nodes, use of the TCP convergence layer [CLAYER] will\n   provide the\
    \ required reliability and congestion control for transport\n   of bundles and\
    \ would be the default choice in the Internet.\n   Alternatives such as encapsulating\
    \ bundles directly in datagrams and\n   using UDP or DCCP are not generally appropriate\
    \ because they offer\n   limited reliability and, in the case of UDP, no congestion\
    \ control.\n   LTP, on the other hand, offers its own form of reliability.\n \
    \  Particularly for testing purposes, it makes no sense to run LTP over\n   a\
    \ protocol like TCP that offers reliability already.  In addition,\n   running\
    \ LTP over TCP would reduce the flexibility available to users,\n   since LTP\
    \ offers more control over what data is delivered reliably\n   and what data is\
    \ delivered best effort, a feature that TCP lacks.  As\n   such, it would be better\
    \ to run LTP over an unreliable protocol.\n   One solution would be to use UDP.\
    \  UDP provides no reliability,\n   allowing LTP to manage that itself.  However,\
    \ UDP also does not\n   provide congestion control.  Because LTP is designed to\
    \ run over\n   fixed-rate radio links, it does provide rate control but not\n\
    \   congestion control.  Lack of congestion control in network\n   connections\
    \ is a major problem that can cause artificially high loss\n   rates and/or serious\
    \ fairness issues.  Previous standards documents\n   are unanimous in recommending\
    \ congestion control for protocols to be\n   used on the Internet, see \"Congestion\
    \ Control Principles\" [RFC2914],\n   \"Unicast UDP Usage Guidelines\" [RFC5405],\
    \ and \"Queue Management and\n   Congestion Avoidance\" [RFC2309], among others.\
    \  RFC 5405, in\n   particular, calls congestion control \"vital\" for \"applications\
    \ that\n   can operate at higher, potentially unbounded data rates\".  Therefore,\n\
    \   any Bundle Protocol implementation permitting the use of UDP to\n   transport\
    \ LTP segments or bundles outside an isolated network for the\n   transmission\
    \ of any non-trivial amounts of data MUST implement\n   congestion control consistent\
    \ with RFC 5405.\n   Alternatively, the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)\n\
    \   [RFC4340] was designed specifically to provide congestion control\n   without\
    \ reliability for those applications that traverse the Internet\n   but do not\
    \ desire to retransmit lost data.  As such, it is\n   RECOMMENDED that, if possible,\
    \ DCCP be used to transport LTP segments\n   across the Internet.\n"

- title: 3.1.  How and Where to Deal with Fragmentation
  contents:
  - "3.1.  How and Where to Deal with Fragmentation\n   The Bundle Protocol allows\
    \ bundles with sizes limited only by node\n   resource constraints.  In IPv4,\
    \ the maximum size of a UDP datagram is\n   nearly 64 KB.  In IPv6, when using\
    \ jumbograms [RFC2675], UDP\n   datagrams can technically be up to 4 GB in size\
    \ [RFC2147], although\n   this option is rarely used.  (Note: RFC 2147 was obsoleted\
    \ by RFC\n   2675.)  It is well understood that sending large IP datagrams that\n\
    \   must be fragmented by the network has enormous efficiency penalties\n   [Kent87].\
    \  The Bundle Protocol specification provides a bundle\n   fragmentation concept\
    \ [RFC5050] that allows a large bundle to be\n   divided into bundle fragments.\
    \  If the Bundle Protocol is being\n   encapsulated in DCCP or UDP, it therefore\
    \ SHOULD create each fragment\n   of sufficiently small size that it can then\
    \ be encapsulated into a\n   datagram that will not need to be fragmented at the\
    \ IP layer.\n   IP fragmentation can be avoided by using IP Path MTU Discovery\n\
    \   [RFC1191] [RFC1981], which depends on the deterministic delivery of\n   ICMP\
    \ Packet Too Big (PTB) messages from routers in the network.  To\n   bypass a\
    \ condition referred to as a black hole [RFC2923], a newer\n   specification is\
    \ available in [RFC4821] to determine the IP Path MTU\n   without the use of PTB\
    \ messages.  This document does not attempt to\n   recommend one fragmentation\
    \ avoidance mechanism over another; the\n   information in this section is included\
    \ for the benefit of\n   implementers.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  DCCP
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  DCCP\n   Because DCCP implementations are not required to support IP\n\

    \ cannot be sent as a single MTU-sized datagram.\n"

    \   be fragmented, as discussed above.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Bundle Protocol over a Datagram Convergence Layer
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Bundle Protocol over a Datagram Convergence Layer\n   In general, the use\
    \ of the Bundle Protocol over a datagram CL is\n   discouraged in IP networks.\
    \  Bundles can be of (almost) arbitrary\n   length, and the Bundle Protocol does\
    \ not include an effective\n   retransmission mechanism.  Whenever possible, the\
    \ Bundle Protocol\n   SHOULD be operated over the TCP Convergence Layer or over\
    \ LTP.\n   If a datagram CL is used for transmission of bundles, every datagram\n\
    \   MUST contain exactly one bundle or 4 octets of zero bits as a keep-\n   alive.\
    \  Bundles that are too large for the path MTU SHOULD be\n   fragmented and reassembled\

    \   LTP segments are transported over a \"local data-link layer\" (RFC 5325\n\
    \   [RFC5325]); we will use the term \"transport\" from here on.  Transport\n\
    \   of LTP using datagrams is an appropriate choice.  When a datagram\n   transport\
    \ is used to send LTP segments, every datagram MUST contain\n   exactly one LTP\
    \ segment or 4 octets of zero bits as a keep-alive.\n   LTP MUST perform segmentation\

- title: 3.4.  Keep-Alive Option
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Keep-Alive Option\n   It may be desirable for a UDP or DCCP CL or transport\
    \ to send \"keep-\n   alive\" packets during extended idle periods.  This may\
    \ be needed to\n   refresh a contact table entry at the destination, or to maintain\
    \ an\n   address mapping in a NAT or a dynamic access rule in a firewall.\n  \
    \ Therefore, the CL or transport MAY send a datagram containing exactly\n   4\
    \ octets of zero bits.  The CL or transport receiving such a packet\n   MUST discard\
    \ this packet.  The receiving CL or transport may then\n   perform local maintenance\
    \ of its state tables; these maintenance\n   functions are not covered in this\
    \ document.  Note that packets\n   carrying bundles or segments will always contain\
    \ more than 4 octets\n   of information (either the bundle or the LTP header);\
    \ keep-alive\n   packets will therefore never be mistaken for actual data packets.\
    \  If\n   UDP or DCCP is being used for communication in both directions\n   between\
    \ a pair of bundle agents, transmission and processing of keep-\n   alives in\
    \ the two directions occurs independently.  Keep-alive\n   intervals SHOULD be\

  - "3.5.  Checksums\n   Both the core Bundle Protocol specification and core LTP\n\

- title: 3.5.1.  DCCP
  contents:
  - "3.5.1.  DCCP\n   A DCCP transmitter MUST, therefore, ensure that the entire packet\
    \ is\n   checksummed by setting the Checksum Coverage to zero.  Likewise, the\n\
    \   DCCP receiver MUST ignore all packets with partial checksum coverage.\n"
- title: 3.5.2.  UDP
  contents:
  - "3.5.2.  UDP\n   A UDP transmitter, therefore, MUST NOT disable UDP checksums,\
    \ and the\n   UDP receiver MUST NOT disable the checking of received UDP checksums.\n\
    \   Even when UDP checksums are enabled, a small probability of UDP\n   packet\
    \ corruption remains.  In some environments, it may be\n   acceptable for LTP\
    \ or the Bundle Protocol to occasionally receive\n   corrupted input.  In general,\

  - "3.6.  DCCP Congestion Control Modules\n   DCCP supports pluggable congestion\
    \ control modules in order to\n   optimize its behavior to particular environments.\
    \  The two most\n   common congestion control modules (CCIDs) are TCP-like Congestion\n\
    \   Control (CCID2) [RFC4341] and TCP-Friendly Rate Control (CCID3)\n   [RFC4342].\
    \  TCP-like Congestion Control is designed to emulate TCP's\n   congestion control\
    \ as much as possible.  It is recommended for\n   applications that want to send\
    \ data as quickly as possible, while\n   TCP-Friendly Rate Control is aimed at\
    \ applications that want to avoid\n   sudden changes in sending rate.  DTN use\
    \ cases seem to fit more into\n   the first case, so DCCP CL's and transports\
    \ SHOULD use TCP-like\n   Congestion Control (CCID2) by default.\n"

  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   Port number assignments 1113/UDP and 4556/UDP have\
    \ been registered\n   with IANA.  The assignment for 1113/UDP referenced [RFC5326];\
    \ this\n   entry has been changed to add the present document in addition to\n\
    \   [RFC5326].  The assignment of 4556/UDP had no reference; this entry\n   has\
    \ been changed to point to the present document.  The service name\n   for 4556/UDP\
    \ has been changed from dtn-bundle-udp to dtn-bundle.\n   Port number 1113/DCCP\
    \ (ltp-deepspace) with Service Code 7107696 has\n   been assigned for the transport\
    \ of LTP.  Port number 4556/DCCP (dtn-\n   bundle) with Service Code 1685351985\
    \ has been assigned for the\n   transport of bundles.  The port number assignment\
    \ for 4556/TCP is\n   addressed in the [CLAYER] document.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This memo describes the use of datagrams to transport\
    \ DTN application\n   data.  Hosts may be in the position of having to accept\
    \ and process\n   packets from unknown sources; the DTN Endpoint ID can be discovered\n\
    \   only after the bundle has been retrieved from the DCCP or UDP packet.\n  \
    \ Hosts SHOULD use authentication methods available in the DTN\n   specifications\
    \ to prevent malicious hosts from inserting unknown data\n   into the application.\n\
    \   Hosts need to listen for and process DCCP or UDP data on the known\n   LTP\
    \ or Bundle Protocol ports.  A denial-of-service scenario exists\n   where a malicious\
    \ host sends datagrams at a high rate, forcing the\n   receiving hosts to use\
    \ their resources to process and attempt to\n   authenticate this data.  Whenever\
    \ possible, hosts SHOULD use IP\n   address filtering to limit the origin of packets\
    \ to known hosts.\n"
