- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The shortage of available public IPv4 addresses means that\
    \ it is not\n   always possible for operators to allocate a full IPv4 address\
    \ to\n   every connected device.  This problem is particularly acute while an\n\
    \   operator is migrating from their existing, native IPv4 network to a\n   native\
    \ IPv6 network with IPv4 provided as an overlay service.  During\n   this phase,\
    \ public IPv4 addresses are needed to provide for both\n   existing and transition\
    \ networks.\n   Two main types of solutions have emerged to address the problem\
    \ (see\n   Appendix A of [RFC6269]):\n   1.  Deploying Carrier-Grade Network Address\
    \ Translation devices\n       (CGNs) [RFC6888].\n   2.  Distributing the same\
    \ public IPv4 address to multiple clients\n       differentiated by non-overlapping\
    \ Layer 4 port sets.\n   This memo focuses on the second category of solutions.\n\
    \   [RFC7341] introduces a \"DHCP 4o6 server\", which offers dynamic\n   leasing\
    \ for IPv4 addresses to clients as described in DHCPv4\n   [RFC2131], but transported\
    \ within a DHCPv6 message flow.  This memo\n   specifies a new DHCPv4 option --\
    \ OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS -- and\n   describes how it can be used for the dynamic\
    \ leasing of shared IPv4\n   addresses.\n   Although DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 is used\
    \ as the underlying DHCPv4\n   transport mechanism throughout this document, OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS\
    \ as\n   a DHCPv4 option may also be used in other solutions, if required.\n"
- title: 2.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "2.  Applicability Statement\n   The solution allows multiple hosts to be simultaneously\
    \ allocated the\n   same IP address.  As the IP address is no longer a unique\
    \ identifier\n   for a host, this solution is only suitable for specific architectures\n\
    \   based on the Address plus Port model (A+P) [RFC6346].  Specifically,\n   this\
    \ document presents a solution that applies to [RFC7596] and\n   certain configurations\
    \ of [RFC7597] (e.g., Embedded Address bit\n   (EA-bit) length set to 0).\n  \
    \ The solution should only be used on point-to-point links, tunnels,\n   and/or\
    \ in environments where authentication at the link layer is\n   performed before\
    \ IP address assignment.  It is not suitable for\n   network access over shared\
    \ media (e.g., Ethernet, WLAN, cable).\n"

- title: 4.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "4.  Terminology\n   This document uses the following terms:\n   Shared IPv4 address:\
    \  An IPv4 address with a restricted Layer 4\n                         port set.\n\
    \   Port Set ID (PSID):   Identifier for a range of ports assigned to a\n    \
    \                     DHCP client.\n"
- title: 5.  Functional Overview
  contents:
  - "5.  Functional Overview\n   Functionally, the dynamic allocation of shared IPv4\
    \ addresses by the\n   DHCP 4o6 server is similar to the dynamic allocation process\
    \ for\n   \"full\" IPv4 addresses as described in [RFC2131].  The essential\n\
    \   difference is that the DHCP 4o6 server can allocate the same IPv4\n   address\
    \ to more than one DHCP 4o6 client simultaneously, providing\n   that each shared-address\
    \ allocation also includes a range of Layer 4\n   source ports unique to that\
    \ address (i.e., the combined tuple of IPv4\n   address and Port Set ID is to\
    \ be unique for each active lease).\n   The DHCP 4o6 client implements OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS\
    \ (described\n   below), which is a DHCPv4 option containing PSID information.\
    \  The\n   client includes this option within the Parameter Request List option\n\
    \   [RFC2132] in its DHCPv4 DHCPDISCOVER and DHCPREQUEST messages,\n   indicating\
    \ its support for shared, dynamic address leasing to the\n   DHCP 4o6 server.\n\
    \   OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS is also implemented by the server to identify\n   clients\
    \ that support shared, dynamic address leasing.  With this\n   option, the server\
    \ can dynamically allocate PSIDs to clients and\n   maintain shared IPv4 address\
    \ leases.  The server then manages unique\n   client leases based on the IPv4\
    \ address and PSID tuple, instead of\n   using only the IPv4 address.\n   In the\
    \ event that a client capable of dynamic, shared addressing\n   receives more\
    \ than one DHCP 4o6 offer, where a received offer does\n   not contain OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS\
    \ (i.e., it is an offer for a full\n   IPv4 address), then the client SHOULD prefer\
    \ the full IPv4 offer over\n   the shared IPv4 address offer(s), unless specifically\
    \ configured\n   otherwise.\n"
- title: 6.  Client-Server Interaction
  contents:
  - "6.  Client-Server Interaction\n   The following DHCPv4 message flow is transported\
    \ within the\n   DHCPv4-query and DHCPv4-response messages as described in DHCPv4\
    \ over\n   DHCPv6 [RFC7341].\n   1.  When the client constructs the DHCPv4 DHCPDISCOVER\
    \ message to be\n       transported within the DHCPv4-query message, the DHCPDISCOVER\n\
    \       message MUST include the client identifier option (constructed as\n  \
    \     per [RFC4361]) and the Parameter Request List option with the\n       code\
    \ OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS.  The client MAY insert an\n       OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS\
    \ with preferred values in related fields as a\n       suggestion to the DHCP\
    \ 4o6 server.\n   2.  DHCP 4o6 servers that receive the DHCPDISCOVER message and\n\
    \       support shared IPv4 addresses respond with a DHCPOFFER message\n     \
    \  with the shared IPv4 address in the yiaddr field, and they MUST\n       add\
    \ an OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS option containing an available\n       restricted port\
    \ set.  If the DHCPDISCOVER included an\n       OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS option containing\
    \ a non-zero PSID-len field,\n       the DHCP 4o6 server MAY allocate a port set\
    \ of the requested size\n       to the client (depending on policy).  The DHCPOFFER\
    \ message is\n       then encapsulated in the DHCPv4-response message and sent\
    \ to the\n       client.\n   3.  The client evaluates all received DHCPOFFER messages\
    \ and selects\n       one (e.g., based on the configuration parameters received,\
    \ such\n       as the size of the offered port set).  The client then sends a\n\
    \       DHCPREQUEST encapsulated in the DHCPv4-query message containing\n    \
    \   the corresponding OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS received in the DHCPOFFER\n       message.\n\
    \   4.  The server identified in the DHCPREQUEST message creates a\n       binding\
    \ for the client.  The binding includes the client\n       identifier, the IPv4\
    \ address, and the PSID.  These parameters are\n       used by both the server\
    \ and the client to identify a lease in any\n       DHCP message.  The server\
    \ MUST respond with a DHCPACK message\n       containing OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS\
    \ for the requesting client.\n   5.  On receipt of the DHCPACK message with the\
    \ configuration\n       parameters, the client MUST NOT perform an in-use probe\
    \ on the\n       address, such as ARPing for a duplicate allocated address.\n\
    \   6.  If the client chooses to relinquish its lease by sending a\n       DHCPRELEASE\
    \ message, the client MUST include the leased network\n       address and OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS\
    \ (with the allocated PSID) to\n       identify the lease to be released.\n  \
    \ In the case where the client has stored the previously allocated\n   address\
    \ and restricted port set, the logic described in Section 3.2\n   of [RFC2131]\
    \ MUST be followed on the condition that the client's\n   source IPv6 address\
    \ for DHCP 4o6 does not change.  Note that this\n   corresponds to the INIT-REBOOT\
    \ state defined in [RFC2131].  The\n   client MUST include the OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS\
    \ with the requested\n   port-set information in the message flow, which starts\
    \ with a\n   DHCPREQUEST message.  If the client's DHCP 4o6 IPv6 source address\n\
    \   is changed for any reason, the client MUST re-initiate the DHCP 4o6\n   shared-address\
    \ provisioning process by sending a\n   DHCPDISCOVER message.\n"
- title: 7.  Client Behavior
  contents:
  - "7.  Client Behavior\n   A DHCP 4o6 client sending a DHCPDISCOVER message for\
    \ a shared IPv4\n   address MUST include the OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS Option Code\
    \ in the\n   Parameter Request List option.  If a client has previously been\n\
    \   successfully allocated an IPv4 address and PSID, the client's\n   DHCPDISCOVER\
    \ message MAY include the Requested IP Address option\n   along with an OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS\
    \ to request that a specific IPv4\n   address and PSID be reassigned.  Alternatively,\
    \ the client MAY omit\n   the Requested IP Address option but include an OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS\n\
    \   with a non-zero value in only the PSID-len field, as a hint to the\n   server\
    \ for the preferred size of the port set.\n   A client that requests OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS\
    \ but receives DHCPOFFER\n   and DHCPACK messages without OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS\
    \ SHOULD proceed as\n   described in Section 9 of [RFC7341] and configure a full\
    \ IPv4 address\n   with no address sharing (see Section 8.1).\n   When receiving\
    \ a DHCPACK message containing OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS, the\n   client MUST use the\
    \ received explicit PSID for configuring the\n   interface for which the DHCP\
    \ 4o6 request was made.\n   The client MUST NOT probe a newly received IPv4 address\
    \ (e.g., using\n   ARP) to see if it is in use by another host.\n   When the client\
    \ renews or releases its DHCP lease, it MUST include\n   the offset, PSID length,\
    \ and PSID values in OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS, and\n   send it to the server within\
    \ corresponding DHCPv4 messages.\n   In the event that the client's DHCP 4o6 IPv6\
    \ source address is\n   changed for any reason, the client MUST re-initiate the\
    \ DHCP 4o6\n   shared-address provisioning process by sending a DHCPDISCOVER\n\
    \   message.\n"
- title: 7.1.  Restrictions to Client Usage of a Shared IPv4 Address
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Restrictions to Client Usage of a Shared IPv4 Address\n   As a single IPv4\
    \ address is being shared between a number of\n   different clients, the allocated\
    \ shared address is only suitable for\n   certain uses.  The client MUST implement\
    \ a function to ensure that\n   only the allocated Layer 4 ports of the shared\
    \ IPv4 address are used\n   for sourcing new connections or accepting inbound\
    \ connections.\n   The client MUST apply the following rules for all traffic destined\n\
    \   to, or originating from, the shared IPv4 address:\n   o  The client MUST use\
    \ only port-aware protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, the\n      Datagram Congestion Control\
    \ Protocol (DCCP)) and be ICMP compliant\n      with [RFC5508].\n   o  All connections\
    \ originating from the shared IPv4 address MUST use\n      a source port taken\
    \ from the allocated restricted port set.\n   o  The client MUST NOT accept inbound\
    \ connections on ports outside of\n      the allocated restricted port set.\n\
    \   In order to prevent addressing conflicts that could arise from the\n   allocation\
    \ of the same IPv4 address, the client MUST NOT use the\n   received restricted\
    \ IPv4 address to perform ARP operations.\n   The mechanism by which a client\
    \ implements the above rules is out of\n   scope for this document.\n   In the\
    \ event that the DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 configuration mechanism\n   fails for any\
    \ reason, the client MUST NOT configure an IPv4\n   link-local address [RFC3927]\
    \ (taken from the 169.254.0.0/16 range).\n"
- title: 8.  Server Behavior
  contents:
  - "8.  Server Behavior\n   The DHCP 4o6 server MUST NOT reply with OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS\
    \ unless\n   the client has explicitly listed the Option Code in the Parameter\n\
    \   Request List (Option 55) [RFC2132].\n   The DHCP 4o6 server SHOULD reply with\
    \ OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS if the\n   client includes OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS in its\
    \ Parameter Request List.\n   In order to achieve dynamic management of shared\
    \ IPv4 addresses, the\n   server is required to implement an address and port-set\
    \ pool that\n   provides the same function as the address pool in a regular DHCP\n\
    \   server.  Also, the server uses the combination of address and PSID as\n  \

    \ pool of available addresses and PSIDs, and not\n      already allocated, ELSE\n\
    \   o  The address requested in the Requested IP Address option along\n      with\
    \ the PSID parameters requested in the OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS, if\n      that pair\
    \ of address and PSID is valid and not already allocated,\n      ELSE\n   o  A\
    \ new address with a PSID allocated from the server's pool of\n      available\
    \ addresses and PSIDs.\n   Upon receipt of a DHCPRELEASE message with OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS,\
    \ the\n   server searches for the lease using the address in the ciaddr field\n\
    \   and the PSID information in the OPTION_V4_PORTPARAMS, and marks the\n   lease\
    \ as unallocated if a record (matching that PSID) is maintained\n   by the server\
    \ for that client.\n   The port-set assignment MUST be coupled with the address\
    \ assignment\n   process.  Therefore, the server MUST assign the address and port\
    \ set\n   in the same DHCP message.\n   When defining the pools of IPv4 addresses\
    \ and PSIDs that are\n   available to lease to clients, the server MUST implement\
    \ a mechanism\n   to reserve some port ranges (e.g., 0-1023) from allocation to\n\
    \   clients.  The reservation policy SHOULD be configurable.\n"

    \ configured otherwise\n   (e.g., by allocating a full IPv4 address).\n"
- title: 10.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations described in [RFC2131]\
    \ and [RFC7341] are\n   also potentially applicable to this solution.  Unauthorized\
    \ DHCP 4o6\n   servers in the network could be used to stage an amplification\
    \ attack\n   or to supply an invalid configuration, leading to service disruption.\n\
    \   The risks of these types of attacks can be reduced by using unicast\n   DHCP\
    \ 4o6 message flows (enabled by supplying DHCP 4o6 server unicast\n   addresses\
    \ within the OPTION_DHCP4_O_DHCP6_SERVER option [RFC7341]).\n   A malicious user\
    \ could attempt a DoS attack by requesting a large\n   number of IPv4 address\
    \ (or fractional address) and port-set\n   allocations, exhausting the available\
    \ addresses and port sets for\n   other clients.  This can be mitigated by implementing,\
    \ on each\n   applicable customer site, a DHCP 4o6 address allocation policy that\n\
    \   limits the number of simultaneously active IPv4 leases for clients\n   whose\
    \ requests originate from that customer site.\n   The purpose of the client identifier\
    \ option is to ensure that the\n   same client retains the same parameters over\
    \ time.  However, this\n   interferes with the client's privacy, as it allows\
    \ the server to\n   track the client.  Clients can manage their level of exposure\
    \ by\n   controlling the value of the client identifier, thereby trading off\n\
    \   stability of parameter allocation for privacy.  We expect that\n   guidance\
    \ on this trade-off will be discussed in a future version of\n   [DHCP-Anonymity].\n\
    \   Additional security considerations are discussed in Section 10 of\n   [RFC7597]\
    \ and Section 9 of [RFC7596].\n"
- title: 10.1.  Port Randomization
  contents:
  - "10.1.  Port Randomization\n   Preserving port randomization [RFC6056] may be\
    \ more difficult because\n   the host can only randomize the ports inside a fixed\
    \ port range (see\n   Section 13.4 of [RFC6269]).\n   More discussion regarding\
    \ improving the robustness of TCP against\n   blind in-window attacks can be found\
    \ in [RFC5961].  To provide\n   protection against attacks, means other than (IPv4)\
    \ source port\n   randomization should be used (e.g., use [RFC5961] to improve\
    \ the\n   robustness of TCP against blind in-window attacks, or use IPv6).\n"
