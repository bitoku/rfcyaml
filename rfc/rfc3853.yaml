  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) specification (RFC\
    \ 3261 [1])\n   currently details optional support (a normative MAY) for the use\
    \ of\n   secure MIME, or S/MIME (RFC 2633 [8]).  Since RFC 3261 was published,\n\
    \   the S/MIME specification and the underlying Cryptographic Message\n   Syntax\
    \ (CMS, RFC 3369 [3]) have undergone some revision.  Ongoing\n   work has identified\
    \ AES as a algorithm that might be used for content\n   encryption in S/MIME.\n\
    \   The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES [6]) is widely believed to be\n   faster\
    \ than Triple-DES (3DES, which has previously been mandated for\n   usage with\
    \ S/MIME) and to be comparably secure.  AES is also believed\n   to have comparatively\
    \ low memory requirements, which makes it\n   suitable for use in mobile or embedded\
    \ devices, an important use-case\n   for SIP.\n   As an additional consideration,\
    \ the SIP specification has a\n   recommendation (normative SHOULD) for support\
    \ of Transport Layer\n   Security (TLS, RFC 2246 [7]).  TLS support in SIP requires\
    \ the usage\n   of AES.  That means that currently, implementations that support\
    \ both\n   TLS and S/MIME must support both 3DES and AES.  A similar duplication\n\
    \   of effort exists with DSS in S/MIME as a digital signature algorithm\n   (the\
    \ mandatory TLS ciphersuite used by SIP requires RSA).  Unifying\n   the ciphersuite\
    \ and signature algorithm requirements for TLS and\n   S/MIME would simplify security\
    \ implementations.\n   It is therefore desirable to bring the S/MIME requirement\
    \ for SIP\n   into parity with ongoing work on the S/MIME standard, as well as\
    \ to\n   unify the algorithm requirements for TLS and S/MIME.  To date, S/MIME\n\
    \   has not yet seen widespread deployment in SIP user agents, and\n   therefore\
    \ the minimum ciphersuite for S/MIME could be updated without\n   obsoleting any\
    \ substantial deployments of S/MIME for SIP (in fact,\n   these changes will probably\
    \ make support for S/MIME easier).  This\n   document therefore updates the normative\
    \ requirements for S/MIME in\n   RFC 3261.\n   Note that work on these revisions\
    \ in the S/MIME working group is\n   still in progress.  This document will continue\
    \ to track that work as\n   it evolves.  By initiating this process in the SIP\
    \ WG now, we provide\n   an early opportunity for input into the proposed changes\
    \ and give\n   implementers some warning that the S/MIME requirements for SIP\
    \ are\n   potentially changing.\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   In this document, the key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"\
    REQUIRED\",\n   \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"NOT\n   RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" are to be interpreted as\n\
    \   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [2] and indicate requirement levels for\n  \
    \ compliant SIP implementations.\n"
- title: 3.  S/MIME Ciphersuite Requirements for SIP
  contents:
  - "3.  S/MIME Ciphersuite Requirements for SIP\n   The following updates the text\
    \ of RFC 3261 Section 23.3, specifically\n   the fifth bullet point.  The text\
    \ currently reads:\n   o  S/MIME implementations MUST at a minimum support SHA1\
    \ as a digital\n      signature algorithm, and 3DES as an encryption algorithm.\
    \  All\n      other signature and encryption algorithms MAY be supported.\n  \
    \    Implementations can negotiate support for these algorithms with\n      the\
    \ \"SMIMECapabilities\" attribute.\n   This text is updated with the following:\n\
    \   S/MIME implementations MUST at a minimum support RSA as a digital\n   signature\
    \ algorithm and SHA1 as a digest algorithm [5], and AES as an\n   encryption algorithm\
    \ (as specified in [4].  For key transport, S/MIME\n   implementations MUST support\
    \ RSA key transport as specified in\n   section 4.2.1. of [5].  S/MIME implementations\
    \ of AES MUST support\n   128-bit AES keys, and SHOULD support 192 and 256-bit\
    \ keys.  Note that\n   the S/MIME specification [8] mandates support for 3DES\
    \ as an\n   encryption algorithm, DH for key encryption and DSS as a signature\n\
    \   algorithm.  In the SIP profile of S/MIME, support for 3DES, DH and\n   DSS\
    \ is RECOMMENDED but not required.  All other signature and\n   encryption algorithms\
    \ MAY be supported.  Implementations can\n   negotiate support for algorithms\
    \ with the \"SMIMECapabilities\"\n   attribute.\n   Since SIP is 8-bit clean,\
    \ all implementations MUST use 8-bit binary\n   Content-Transfer-Encoding for\
    \ S/MIME in SIP.  Implementations MAY\n   also be able to receive base-64 Content-Transfer-Encoding.\n"
