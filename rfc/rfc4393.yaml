  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The third-generation partnership project 2 (3GPP2) for 3rd\
    \ generation\n   cellular telephony has defined a standard file format to contain\n\
    \   audio/visual sequences that may be downloaded to cellular phones\n   [3gpp2].\
    \  At the time of writing, the 3GPP2 file format (3G2) can\n   contain H.263,\
    \ H.264, or MPEG-4 video; and 13K Vocoder, EVRC or AMR\n   Narrow-band speech,\
    \ or AAC audio; and 3GPP timed text.\n   Within the file, as with all files in\
    \ the 'ISO' family, there is an\n   intrinsic file-type box, which identifies\
    \ those specifications to\n   which the file complies, and which players (possibly\
    \ compliant with\n   only one specification) are permitted by the content author\
    \ to play\n   the file.  This identification is through four-letter 'brands'.\n\
    \   Files identified by the MIME [MIME1] type defined in this document\n   MUST\
    \ contain, in their compatible brands list, a brand defined in a\n   standard\
    \ (issued by 3GPP2) that can apply to 3GPP2 files.\n   The MIME types defined\
    \ in this document are needed correctly to\n   identify such files when they are\
    \ served over HTTP, included in\n   multi-part documents, or used in other places\
    \ where MIME types are\n   used.\n"

- title: 2.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  Security Considerations\n   The 3GPP2 file format may contain audio, video,\
    \ and displayable text\n   data.  There is currently no provision for 'active'\
    \ elements (such as\n   scripts) of any kind.\n   Clearly, it is possible to author\
    \ malicious files that attempt to\n   call for an excessively large picture size,\
    \ high sampling-rate audio,\n   etc.  However, clients can and usually do protect\
    \ themselves against\n   this kind of attack.\n   It should be noted that selected\
    \ metadata fields may encompass\n   information partly intended to protect the\
    \ media against unauthorized\n   use or distribution.  In this case, the intention\
    \ is that alteration\n   or removal of the data in the field would be treated\
    \ as an offense\n   under national agreement-based World Intellectual Property\n\
    \   Organization (WIPO) treaties.\n   3GPP2 files have an extensible structure,\
    \ so it is theoretically\n   possible that metadata fields or media formats could\
    \ be defined in\n   the future that could be used to induce particular actions\
    \ on the\n   part of the recipient, thus presenting additional security risks;\
    \ but\n   this type of capability is currently not supported in the referenced\n\
    \   specification.\n   Encryption, signing, or authentication of these file formats\
    \ can be\n   done using any media-independent transformations of the file or media\n\
    \   data.\n"
- title: 3.  MIME Types
  contents:
  - "3.  MIME Types\n   This registration applies to all files defined as using the\
    \ '3G2'\n   file format and identified with a suitable brand in a 3GPP2\n   specification.\
    \  The usual file suffix for all these files is \".3g2\".\n"
