- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The administrative structures of the Internet Numbers Registry\
    \ System\n   described in this document are largely the result of the interaction\n\
    \   of operational practices, existing routing technology, number\n   resource\
    \ assignments that have occurred over time, and network\n   architectural history.\
    \  Further discussion and analysis of these\n   interactions are outside the scope\
    \ of this document.\n   This document provides information about the current Internet\
    \ Numbers\n   Registry System used in the distribution of globally unique Internet\n\
    \   Protocol (IP) address space and autonomous system (AS) numbers.  It\n   also\
    \ describes the processes used for further evolution of the\n   Internet Numbers\
    \ Registry System.  This document does not propose any\n   changes to the current\
    \ operation of this system.\n   This document replaces RFC 2050.  Since the publication\
    \ of RFC 2050,\n   the Internet Numbers Registry System has changed significantly.\
    \  This\n   document describes the present Internet Numbers Registry System.\n"
- title: 2.  Goals
  contents:
  - "2.  Goals\n   Internet number resources are currently distributed according to\
    \ the\n   following (non-exclusive) goals:\n   1)  Allocation Pool Management:\
    \ Due to the fixed lengths of IP\n       addresses and AS numbers, the pools from\
    \ which these resources\n       are allocated are finite.  As such, allocations\
    \ must be made in\n       accordance with the operational needs of those running\
    \ the\n       networks that make use of these number resources and by taking\n\
    \       into consideration pool limitations at the time of allocation.\n   2)\
    \  Hierarchical Allocation: Given current routing technology, the\n       distribution\
    \ of IP addresses in a hierarchical manner increases\n       the likelihood of\
    \ continued scaling of the Internet's routing\n       system.  As such, it is\
    \ currently a goal to allocate IP addresses\n       in such a way that permits\
    \ aggregation of these addresses into a\n       minimum number of routing announcements.\
    \  However, whether IP\n       addresses are actually announced to the Internet\
    \ and the manner\n       of their advertisement into the Internet's routing system\
    \ are\n       operational considerations outside the scope of the Internet\n \
    \      Numbers Registry System.\n   3)  Registration Accuracy: A core requirement\
    \ of the Internet Numbers\n       Registry System is to maintain a registry of\
    \ allocations to\n       ensure uniqueness and to provide accurate registration\n\
    \       information of those allocations in order to meet a variety of\n     \
    \  operational requirements.  Uniqueness ensures that IP addresses\n       and\
    \ AS numbers are not allocated to more than one party at the\n       same time.\n\
    \   These goals may sometimes conflict with each other or with the\n   interests\
    \ of individual end users, Internet service providers, or\n   other number resource\
    \ consumers.  Careful analysis, judgment, and\n   cooperation among registry system\
    \ providers and consumers at all\n   levels via community-developed policies are\
    \ necessary to find\n   appropriate compromises to facilitate Internet operations.\n"
- title: 3.  Internet Numbers Registry System Structure
  contents:
  - "3.  Internet Numbers Registry System Structure\n   The Internet Registry (IR)\
    \ hierarchy was established to provide for\n   the allocation of IP addresses\
    \ and AS numbers with consideration to\n   the above goals.  This hierarchy is\
    \ rooted in the Internet Assigned\n   Numbers Authority (IANA) address allocation\
    \ function, which serves a\n   set of \"Regional Internet Registries\" (RIRs);\
    \ the RIRs then serve a\n   set of \"Local Internet Registries\" (LIRs) and other\
    \ customers.  LIRs\n   in turn serve their respective number resource consumers\
    \ (which may\n   be themselves, their customers, \"sub-LIRs\", etc.)\n   IETF\n\
    \      The IETF specifies the underlying technical facilities and\n      constraints\
    \ of Internet numbers administered by the Internet\n      Numbers Registry System.\
    \  These specifications are aimed at\n      enabling and protecting the long-term\
    \ viability of the Internet,\n      and adjustments to those specifications are\
    \ made over time as\n      circumstances warrant.  The IETF has also reserved\
    \ portions of the\n      Internet number spaces and identifiers for future needs.\n\
    \   IANA\n      The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is a role, not\
    \ an\n      organization.  For the Internet Numbers Registry System, the IANA\n\
    \      role manages the top of the IP address and AS number allocation\n     \
    \ hierarchies.  The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and\n      Numbers\
    \ (ICANN) currently fulfills the IANA role in accordance\n      with the IETF-ICANN\
    \ \"Memorandum of Understanding Concerning\n      Technical Work of the Internet\
    \ Assigned Numbers Authority\", which\n      was signed and ratified in March\
    \ 2000 [RFC2860].  In addition,\n      ICANN performs the IANA services related\
    \ to the IP address space\n      and AS numbers according to global number resource\
    \ policies that\n      have been developed by the community and formalized under\
    \ a\n      Memorandum of Understanding between ICANN and the Regional\n      Internet\
    \ Registries [ASOMOU] and documented in [ICANNv4],\n      [ICANNv6], and [ICANNASN].\n\
    \   Regional IRs\n      In order to promote distribution of the Internet number\
    \ resource\n      registration function, RFC 1366 proposed delegating responsibility\n\
    \      to regional bodies.  (Note: RFC 1366 was replaced by RFC 1466,\n      which\
    \ was replaced by RFC 2050.)  These bodies became known as the\n      Regional\
    \ Internet Registries (RIRs).  The RIRs operate in\n      continent-sized geopolitical\
    \ regions.  Currently, there are five\n      RIRs: AfriNIC serving Africa, APNIC\
    \ serving parts of Asia and the\n      Pacific region, ARIN serving North America\
    \ and parts of the\n      Caribbean, LACNIC serving Latin America and parts of\
    \ the\n      Caribbean, and RIPE NCC serving Europe, parts of Asia and the\n \
    \     Middle East.  The RIRs were established in a bottom-up fashion via\n   \
    \   a global policy process that has been documented as the ICANN\n      \"Internet\
    \ Consensus Policy 2\" [ICP-2], which details the\n      principles and criteria\
    \ for establishment of Regional Internet\n      Registries.  The RIRs also conduct\
    \ regional number policy\n      development used in the administration of the\
    \ number resources for\n      which they are responsible.\n   Local IRs\n    \
    \  Local Internet Registries (LIRs) are established through a\n      relationship\
    \ with the body from which they received their\n      addresses, typically the\
    \ RIR that serves the region in which they\n      operate, a parent LIR, or other\
    \ number-allocating entity.  In\n      cases where LIRs span multiple regions,\
    \ those LIRs have\n      established relationships with multiple RIRs.  LIRs perform\
    \ IP\n      address allocation services for their customers, typically ISPs,\n\
    \      end users, or child LIRs (also known as \"sub-LIRs\").\n"
- title: 4.  Internet Numbers Registry Technical Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Internet Numbers Registry Technical Considerations\n   As a result of the\
    \ system of technical standards and guidelines\n   established by the IETF as\
    \ well as historical and operational\n   constraints, there have been technical\
    \ considerations regarding the\n   services provided by the Internet Numbers Registry\
    \ System as it\n   evolved.  These technical considerations have included:\n \
    \  1)  Reverse DNS: In situations where reverse DNS was used, the\n       policies\
    \ and practices of the Internet Numbers Registry System\n       have included\
    \ consideration of the technical and operational\n       requirements posed by\
    \ reverse DNS zone delegation [RFC5855].\n   2)  Public WHOIS: The policies and\
    \ practices of the Internet Numbers\n       Registry System have included consideration\
    \ of the technical and\n       operational requirements for supporting WHOIS services\
    \ [RFC3013]\n       [RFC3912].\n   As the Internet and the Internet Numbers Registry\
    \ System continue to\n   evolve, it may be necessary for the Internet community\
    \ to examine\n   these and related technical and operational considerations and\
    \ how\n   best to meet them.  This evolution is discussed in the next section.\n"
- title: 5.  Internet Numbers Registry Evolution
  contents:
  - "5.  Internet Numbers Registry Evolution\n   Over the years, the Internet Numbers\
    \ Registry System has developed\n   mechanisms by which the structures, policies,\
    \ and processes of the\n   Internet Numbers Registry System itself can evolve\
    \ to meet the\n   changing demands of the global Internet community.  Further\
    \ evolution\n   of the Internet Numbers Registry System is expected to occur in\
    \ an\n   open, transparent, and broad multi-stakeholder manner.\n   Per the delineation\
    \ of responsibility for Internet address policy\n   issues specified in the IETF/IAB/ICANN\
    \ MOU [RFC2860], discussions\n   regarding the evolution of the Internet Numbers\
    \ Registry System\n   structure, policy, and processes are to take place within\
    \ the ICANN\n   framework and will respect ICANN's core values [ICANNBL].  These\
    \ core\n   values encourage broad, informed participation reflecting the\n   functional,\
    \ geographic, and cultural diversity of the Internet at all\n   levels of policy\
    \ development and decision making, as well as the\n   delegation of coordination\
    \ functions and recognition of the policy\n   roles of other responsible entities\
    \ that reflect the interests of\n   affected parties.  The discussions regarding\
    \ Internet Numbers\n   Registry evolution must also continue to consider the overall\n\
    \   Internet address architecture and technical goals referenced in this\n   document.\n\
    \   The foregoing does not alter the IETF's continued responsibility for\n   the\
    \ non-policy aspects of Internet addressing such as the\n   architectural definition\
    \ of IP address and AS number spaces and\n   specification of associated technical\
    \ goals and constraints in their\n   application, assignment of specialized address\
    \ blocks, and\n   experimental technical assignments as documented in RFC 2860.\
    \  In\n   addition, in the cases where the IETF sets technical recommendations\n\
    \   for protocols, practices, or services that are directly related to IP\n  \
    \ address space or AS numbers, such recommendations must be taken into\n   consideration\
    \ in Internet Numbers Registry System policy discussions\n   regardless of venue.\n"
- title: 6.  Summary of Changes since RFC 2050
  contents:
  - "6.  Summary of Changes since RFC 2050\n   Since RFC 2050 was published, the Internet\
    \ and the Internet Numbers\n   Registry System have undergone significant change.\
    \  This document\n   describes the Internet Numbers Registry System as it presently\
    \ exists\n   and omits policy and operational procedures that have been superseded\n\
    \   by ICANN and RIR policy since the publication of RFC 2050.\n   One particular\
    \ change of note is that RFC 2050 defined an appeal\n   process and included:\n\
    \      If necessary, after exhausting all other avenues, the appeal may\n    \
    \  be forwarded to IANA for a final decision.  Each registry must, as\n      part\
    \ of their policy, document and specify how to appeal a\n      registry assignment\
    \ decision.\n   The RIRs have developed consensus-based policies for appeals,\
    \ and\n   over time, they have become accepted by the respective RIR\n   communities.\
    \  As a result, the ability to further appeal to IANA is\n   no longer appropriate.\n"
