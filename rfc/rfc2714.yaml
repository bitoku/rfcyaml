- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   This document assumes that the reader has a general understanding\
    \ of\n   CORBA.\n   Traditionally, LDAP directories have been used to store data.\
    \ Users\n   and programmers think of the directory as a hierarchy of directory\n\
    \   entries, each containing a set of attributes.  You look up an entry\n   from\
    \ the directory and extract the attribute(s) of interest.  For\n   example, you\
    \ can look up a person's telephone number from the\n   directory.  Alternatively,\
    \ you can search the directory for entries\n   with a particular set of attributes.\
    \  For example, you can search for\n   all persons in the directory with the surname\
    \ \"Smith\".\n   CORBA applications require access to CORBA objects. Traditionally,\n\
    \   CORBA applications have used the COS Naming service for storage and\n   retrieval\
    \ of CORBA object references. When deployed in environments\n   with a directory,\
    \ CORBA applications should be able to use the\n   directory as a repository for\
    \ CORBA object references. The directory\n   provides a centrally administered,\
    \ and possibly replicated, service\n   for use by CORBA applications distributed\
    \ across the network.\n   For example, an application server may use the directory\
    \ for\n   \"registering\" CORBA objects representing the services that it\n  \
    \ manages, so that a client can later search the directory to locate\n   those\
    \ services as it needs.\n   The motivation for this document is to define a common\
    \ way for\n   applications to store and retrieve CORBA object references from\
    \ the\n   directory.  Using this common schema, any CORBA application that\n \
    \  needs to read or store CORBA object references in the directory can\n   do\
    \ so in an interoperable way.\n   Note that this schema is defined for storing\
    \ CORBA \"object\n   references,\" not CORBA objects in general. There might be\
    \ other ways\n   to store CORBA objects in an LDAP directory but they are not\
    \ covered\n   by this schema.\n"
- title: 2. Representation of CORBA Object References
  contents:
  - "2. Representation of CORBA Object References\n   This document defines schema\
    \ elements to represent a CORBA object\n   reference in LDAP directory. Applications\
    \ in possession of a\n   reference to an object can invoke calls on that object.\
    \  Such a\n   reference is termed an \"interoperable object reference,\" or IOR.\n\
    \   Access to CORBA objects by using IORs is achieved transparently to\n   the\
    \ application, by means of the General Inter-ORB Protocol.\n   A CORBA object\
    \ reference is represented in the directory by the\n   object class corbaObjectReference.\
    \ corbaObjectReference is a subclass\n   of the abstract corbaObject object class.\
    \ corbaObjectReference is an\n   auxiliary object class, which means that it needs\
    \ to be mixed in with\n   a structural object class.\n   The object class corbaContainer\
    \ is used in a directory entry which\n   represents a CORBA object or object reference.\
    \ It is a structural\n   object class, and when representing an object reference,\
    \ the\n   corbaObjectReference object class would also need to be present in\n\
    \   the entry.  corbaContainer is not required when a subclass of\n   corbaObject\
    \ (such as corbaObjectReference) is mixed in with another\n   structural object\
    \ class.\n   The definitions for the object classes corbaObject,\n   corbaObjectReference,\
    \ and corbaContainer are presented in Section 4.\n   The corbaObject class has\
    \ two optional attributes: corbaRepositoryId\n   and description.  corbaRepositoryId\
    \ is a multivalued attribute that\n   is used to store the repository ids of the\
    \ interfaces implemented by\n   a CORBA object.  description is used to store\
    \ a textual description\n   of a CORBA object.\n   The corbaObjectReference class\
    \ has one mandatory attribute: corbaIor.\n   corbaIor is used to store the object's\
    \ stringified IOR.\n   corbaIor and corbaRepositoryId are defined in Section 3;\
    \ description\n   is defined in [v3Schema].\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1 corbaIor\n   This attribute stores the string representation of the interoperable\n\
    \   object reference (IOR) for a CORBA object. An IOR is an opaque handle\n  \
    \ for the object which contains the information necessary to locate the\n   object,\
    \ even if the object is in another ORB.\n   This attribute's syntax is 'IA5 String'\
    \ and its case is\n   insignificant.\n   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.42.2.27.4.1.14\n    NAME\

- title: 3.2 corbaRepositoryId
  contents:
  - "3.2 corbaRepositoryId\n   Each CORBA interface has a unique \"repository id\"\
    \ (also called \"type\n   id\") that identifies the interface.  A CORBA object\
    \ has one or more\n   repository ids, one for each interface that it implements.\n\
    \   The format of a repository id can be any string, but the OMG\n   specifies\
    \ four standard formats:\n      a. IDL-style\n       IDL:Prefix/ModuleName/InterfaceName:VersionNumber\n\
    \   For example, the repository id for the \"NamingContext\" in OMG's COS\n  \
    \ Naming module is:  \"IDL:omg.org/CosNaming/NamingContext:1.0\".\n      b. RMI-style\n\
    \       RMI:ClassName:HashCode[:SUID]\n   This format is used by RMI-IIOP remote\
    \ objects [RMI-IIOP].\n   \"ClassName\" is the fully qualified name of the class\
    \ (for example,\n   \"java.lang.String\"). \"HashCode\" is the object's hash code\
    \ (that is,\n   that obtained by invoking the \"hashCode()\" method).  \"SUID\"\
    \ is the\n   \"stream unique identifier\", which is a 64-bit number that uniquely\n\
    \   identifies the serialization version of the class; SUID is optional\n   in\
    \ the repository id.\n      c. DCE-style\n       DCE:UUID\n   This format is used\
    \ for DCE/CORBA interoperability [CORBA-DCE].\n   \"UUID\" represents a DCE UUID.\n\
    \      d. \"local\"\n   This format is defined by the local Object Request Broker\
    \ (ORB).\n   The corbaRepositoryId attribute is a multivalued attribute; each\n\
    \   value records a single repository id of an interface implemented by\n   the\
    \ CORBA object.  This attribute need not contain a complete list of\n   the interfaces\
    \ implemented by the CORBA object.\n   This attribute's syntax is 'Directory String'\
    \ and its case is\n   significant.  The values of this attribute are encoded using\
    \ UTF-8.\n   Some values may require translation from their native representation\n\
    \   in order to be correctly encoded using UTF-8.\n   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.42.2.27.4.1.15\n\
