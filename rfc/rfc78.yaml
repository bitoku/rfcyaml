- title: What was Learned
  contents:
  - "What was Learned\n   The UCSB and RAND NCPs responded as specified in Document\
    \ #1.  RAND\n   uncovered a few minor problems with their Network Services Program\n\
    \   (NSP) that interfaces video graphics consoles to the NCP.  The nature\n  \
    \ of these problems were data format conversions and human factors\n   aspects\
    \ of display presentation of status information.\n"

  - "The Immediate Future\n   1. Both UCSB and RAND will be happy to participate with\
    \ other sites\n   in verifying their NCPs.\n   2. We intend to conduct additional\
