    \ continues the discussion of a possible transaction oriented\n   transport protocol.\
    \  This memo does not propose a standard.\n   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n\
    DISCUSSION\nIn response to Bob Braden's call for a transaction oriented\nprotocol\
    \ (RFC-955), the following thoughts come to mind:\n   o   The perceived problem\
    \ is that connection set-up and tear-down\n       take too long.\n   o   Other\
    \ aspects of TCP's reliability/robustness approach are\n       presumably still\
    \ desirable.\n   o   We have some spare command bits in the TCP header, and I\
    \ trust\n       that there's still a version number field.\n   o   So why not\
    \ add NYS (no-way handshake) and NIF (graceless close)\n       commands to TCP\
    \ and leave everything else as was (except for the\n       version, of course)?\n\
    Philosophically, that might be somewhat at variance with \"the spirit of\nTCP,\"\
    \ but pragmatically it ought to do the trick. Some careful crafting\nmight be\
    \ required for ISN handling with NYS, but my guess is that if you\nhave to resend\
    \ the first/possibly only segment you just pretend you're\nall of a sudden in\
    \ the middle of SN space (initially you start at the\nbottom of it) and when it\
    \ sees the funny ISN the NYS handler knows it\nshould dequeue anything it might\
    \ have had pending for (re)transmission\nand start fresh, assuming that if anything\
    \ gets through to the starting\nside belatedly it'll get chucked because of being\
    \ well outside the left\nedge of the window, if I'm remembering that part right--and\
    \ please be\naware that I'm not bothering to confirm recollections because I don't\n\
    want to pretend that this is the spec: it's just meant to be the\nconcept, in\
    \ TV talk.  (On the NYS emitting side, presumably you just\ndrop right into ack_expected\
    \ state--or whatever the right name is--after\nsetting an appropriate bit that'll\
    \ get you to fiddle the ISN if you take\na timeout.)   Maybe you even fiddle the\
    \ ISNs more elaborately, to allow\nfor several false starts rather than \"two\
    \ strikes and you're out,\" and\nmaybe we take some spurious segment hits if SNs\
    \ get suitably balled up,\nbut if you really think handshaking is too expensive\
    \ then that's the way\nthe premise crumbles.\nRFC 962                        \

    \ closes\n"
