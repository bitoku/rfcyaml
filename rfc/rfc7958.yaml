  - "Abstract\n   The root zone of the Domain Name System (DNS) has been\n   cryptographically\
    \ signed using DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC).\n   In order to obtain secure\
    \ answers from the root zone of the DNS using\n   DNSSEC, a client must configure\
    \ a suitable trust anchor.  This\n   document describes the format and publication\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) is described in [RFC1034] and\
    \ [RFC1035].\n   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are described in [RFC4033],\n\
    \   [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC4509], [RFC5155], and [RFC5702].\n   A discussion\
    \ of operational practices relating to DNSSEC can be found\n   in [RFC6781].\n\
    \   In the DNSSEC protocol, Resource Record Sets (RRSets) are signed\n   cryptographically.\
    \  This means that a response to a query contains\n   signatures that allow the\
    \ integrity and authenticity of the RRSet to\n   be verified.  DNSSEC signatures\
    \ are validated by following a chain of\n   signatures to a \"trust anchor\".\
    \  The reason for trusting a trust\n   anchor is outside the DNSSEC protocol,\
    \ but having one or more trust\n   anchors is required for the DNSSEC protocol\
    \ to work.\n   The publication of trust anchors for the root zone of the DNS is\
    \ an\n   IANA function performed by ICANN.  A detailed description of\n   corresponding\
    \ key management practices can be found in [DPS], which\n   can be retrieved from\
    \ the IANA Repository at\n   <https://www.iana.org/dnssec/>.\n   This document\
    \ describes the formats and distribution methods of\n   DNSSEC trust anchors that\
    \ have been used by IANA for the root zone of\n   the DNS since 2010.  Other organizations\
    \ might have different formats\n   and mechanisms for distributing DNSSEC trust\
    \ anchors for the root\n   zone; however, most operators and software vendors\
    \ have chosen to\n   rely on the IANA trust anchors.\n   It is important to note\
    \ that at the time of this writing, IANA\n   intends to change the formats and\
    \ distribution methods in the future.\n   If such a change happens, IANA will\
    \ publish the changes on its web\n   site at <https://www.iana.org/dnssec/files>.\n\
    \   The formats and distribution methods described in this document are a\n  \
    \ complement to, not a substitute for, the automated DNSSEC trust\n   anchor update\
    \ protocol described in [RFC5011].  That protocol allows\n   for secure in-band\
    \ succession of trust anchors when trust has already\n   been established.  This\
    \ document describes one way to establish an\n   initial trust anchor that can\
    \ be used by [RFC5011].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Definitions\n   The term \"trust anchor\" is used in many different contexts\
    \ in the\n   security community.  Many of the common definitions conflict because\n\
    \   they are specific to a specific system, such as just for DNSSEC or\n   just\
    \ for S/MIME messages.\n   In cryptographic systems with hierarchical structure,\
    \ a trust anchor\n   is an authoritative entity for which trust is assumed and\
    \ not\n   derived.  The format of the entity differs in different systems, but\n\
    \   the basic idea, that trust is assumed and not derived, is common to\n   all\
    \ the common uses of the term \"trust anchor\".\n   The root zone trust anchor\
    \ formats published by IANA are defined in\n   Section 2.  [RFC4033] defines a\
    \ trust anchor as \"A configured DNSKEY\n   RR or DS RR hash of a DNSKEY RR\"\
    .  Note that the formats defined here\n   do not match the definition of \"trust\
    \ anchor\" from [RFC4033];\n   however, a system that wants to convert the trusted\
    \ material from\n   IANA into a Delegation Signer (DS) RR can do so.\n   The key\
    \ words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"\
    SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n\
    \   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  IANA DNSSEC Root Zone Trust Anchor Formats and Semantics
  contents:
  - "2.  IANA DNSSEC Root Zone Trust Anchor Formats and Semantics\n   IANA publishes\
    \ trust anchors for the root zone in three formats:\n   o  an XML document that\
    \ contains the hashes of the DNSKEY records\n   o  certificates in PKIX format\
    \ [RFC5280] that contain DS records and\n      the full public key of DNSKEY records\n\
    \   o  Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) in PKCS #10 format [RFC2986]\n    \
    \  that contain DS records and the full public key of DNSKEY records\n   These\
    \ formats and the semantics associated with each are described in\n   the rest\
    \ of this section.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Hashes in XML
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Hashes in XML\n   The XML document contains a set of hashes for the DNSKEY\

  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  XML Semantics\n   The TrustAnchor element is the container for all of\
    \ the trust anchors\n   in the file.\n   The id attribute in the TrustAnchor element\
    \ is an opaque string that\n   identifies the set of trust anchors.  Its value\
    \ has no particular\n   semantics.  Note that the id element in the TrustAnchor\
    \ element is\n   different than the id element in the KeyDigest element, described\n\
    \   below.\n   The source attribute in the TrustAnchor element gives information\n\
    \   about where to obtain the TrustAnchor container.  It is likely to be\n   a\
    \ URL and is advisory only.\n   The Zone element in the TrustAnchor element states\
    \ to which DNS zone\n   this container applies.  The root zone is indicated by\
    \ a single\n   period (.) character without any quotation marks.\n   The TrustAnchor\
    \ element contains one or more KeyDigest elements.\n   Each KeyDigest element\
    \ represents the digest of a DNSKEY record in\n   the zone defined in the Zone\
    \ element.\n   The id attribute in the KeyDigest element is an opaque string that\n\
    \   identifies the hash.  Its value is used in the file names and URI of\n   the\
    \ other trust anchor formats.  This is described in Section 3.1.\n   For example,\
    \ if the value of the id attribute in the KeyDigest\n   element is \"Kjqmt7v\"\
    , the URI for the CSR that is associated with\n   this hash will be <https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/Kjqmt7v.csr>.\n\
    \   Note that the id element in the KeyDigest element is different than\n   the\
    \ id element in the TrustAnchor element described above.\n   The validFrom and\
    \ validUntil attributes in the KeyDigest element\n   specify the range of times\
    \ that the KeyDigest element can be used as\n   a trust anchor.  Note that the\
    \ KeyDigest element is optional; if it\n   is not given, the trust anchor can\
    \ be used until a KeyDigest element\n   covering the same DNSKEY record, but having\
    \ a validUntil attribute,\n   is trusted by the relying party.  Relying parties\
    \ SHOULD NOT use a\n   KeyDigest outside of the time range given in the validFrom\
    \ and\n   validUntil attributes.\n   The KeyTag element in the KeyDigest element\
    \ contains the key tag for\n   the DNSKEY record represented in this KeyDigest.\n\
    \   The Algorithm element in the KeyDigest element contains the signing\n   algorithm\
    \ identifier for the DNSKEY record represented in this\n   KeyDigest.\n   The\
    \ DigestType element in the KeyDigest element contains the digest\n   algorithm\
    \ identifier for the DNSKEY record represented in this\n   KeyDigest.\n   The\

  contents:
  - "4.  Accepting DNSSEC Trust Anchors\n   A validator operator can choose whether\
    \ or not to accept the trust\n   anchors described in this document using whatever\
    \ policy they want.\n   In order to help validator operators verify the content\
    \ and origin of\n   trust anchors they receive, IANA uses digital signatures that\
    \ chain\n   to an ICANN-controlled Certificate Authority (CA) over the trust\n\
    \   anchor data.\n   It is important to note that the ICANN CA is not a DNSSEC\
    \ trust\n   anchor.  Instead, it is an optional mechanism for verifying the\n\
    \   content and origin of the XML and certificate trust anchors.  It is\n   also\
    \ important to note that the ICANN CA cannot be used to verify the\n   origin\
    \ of the trust anchor in the CSR format.\n   The content and origin of the XML\
    \ file can be verified using a\n   digital signature on the file.  IANA provides\
    \ a detached\n   Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652] signature that chains\
    \ to\n   the ICANN CA with the XML file.  The URL for a detached CMS signature\n\
    \   for the XML file is\n   <https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.p7s>.\n\
    \   (IANA also provided a detached OpenPGP [RFC4880] signature as a\n   second\
    \ parallel verification mechanism for the first trust anchor\n   publication but\
    \ has indicated that it will not use this parallel\n   mechanism in the future.)\n\
    \   Another method IANA uses to help validator operators verify the\n   content\
    \ and origin of trust anchors they receive is to use the\n   Transport Layer Security\
    \ (TLS) protocol for distributing the trust\n   anchors.  Currently, the CA used\
    \ for data.iana.org is well known,\n   that is, one that is a WebTrust-accredited\
    \ CA.  If a system\n   retrieving the trust anchors trusts the CA that IANA uses\
    \ for the\n   \"data.iana.org\" web server, HTTPS SHOULD be used instead of HTTP\
    \ in\n   order to have assurance of data origin.\n"
