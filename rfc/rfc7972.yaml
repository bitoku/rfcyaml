  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines the formal Uniform Resource Name (URN)\n\
    \   Namespace Identifier (NID) for EIDR Identifiers.\n   EIDR Identifiers are\
    \ centrally registered, globally unique\n   identifiers for audiovisual works\
    \ and their variants, primarily film\n   and television.  A unique set of metadata\
    \ parameters describing the\n   associated work is bound to the EIDR Identifier\
    \ at the time of\n   registration.\n   EIDR Identifiers are a special kind of\
    \ DOI Name allocated by EIDR\n   Association specifically for audiovisual works.\
    \  The Digital Object\n   Identifier (DOI) system provides an infrastructure for\
    \ persistent\n   unique identification of objects of any type and is specified\
    \ in\n   [ISO26234].  A DOI Name is the identifier that is permanently\n   assigned\
    \ to an object.  The use of DOI Names ensures persistence,\n   global uniqueness,\
    \ and an open resolution infrastructure.\n   As a DOI Name, an EIDR Identifier\
    \ has two components: a prefix\n   assigned exclusively to EIDR Association by\
    \ the DOI Registration\n   Authority and a suffix defined by EIDR Association.\
    \  Currently, EIDR\n   Identifiers use the prefix \"10.5240\", but additional\
    \ prefixes might\n   be introduced in the future.\n   The following is an example\
    \ of an EIDR Identifier in its canonical\n   representation:\n               \
    \    10.5240/7791-8534-2C23-9030-8610-5\n   where \"10.5240\" is the prefix and\
    \ \"7791-8534-2C23-9030-8610-5\" is the\n   suffix.\n   The canonical URN representation\
    \ of the same EIDR Identifier is:\n                   urn:eidr:10.5240:7791-8534-2C23-9030-8610-5\n\
    \   Note that \":\" is used as separator between the prefix and the suffix\n \
    \  since \"/\" is a URN reserved character.\n   [EIDR-OVERVIEW] and [EIDR-INTRO]\
    \ provide additional background\n   information.\n   This document obsoletes RFC\
    \ 7302.  See Appendix A for a summary of\n   changes.\n"
- title: 2.  Completed URN Namespace Definition Template
  contents:
  - "2.  Completed URN Namespace Definition Template\n   The namespace definition\
    \ according to the template in [RFC3406] is as\n   follows:\n   Namespace ID:\n\
    \      eidr\n   Registration Information:\n      Version 1\n      2014-03-03\n\
    \   Declared registrant of the namespace:\n      Name:\n         Entertainment\
    \ Identifier Registry Association\n      Address:\n         c/o Alliances Management\n\
    \         544 Hillside Road\n         Redwood City, CA 94062\n         USA\n \
    \     Contact:\n         URL: http://eidr.org/contact/\n         Email: info@eidr.org\n\
    \   Declaration of syntactic structure:\n      An EIDR Identifier is a special\
    \ kind of DOI Name (see [ISO26234])\n      and, as such, consists of two components:\
    \ a prefix denoted EIDR-\n      PREFIX and a suffix denoted EIDR-SUFFIX.  The\
    \ URN representation\n      URN-EIDR of an EIDR Identifier conforms to the syntax\
    \ (expressed\n      using [RFC5234]):\n                   URN-EIDR = \"urn:eidr:\"\
    \ EIDR-NSS\n                   EIDR-NSS = EIDR-PREFIX \":\" EIDR-SUFFIX\n    \
    \               EIDR-PREFIX = 1*EIDR-CHARS\n                   EIDR-SUFFIX = 1*EIDR-CHARS\n\
    \                   EIDR-CHARS = ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\" / \".\" / \"_\"\n     \
    \ The only value of EIDR-PREFIX currently in use is \"10.5240\".\n      Additional\
    \ prefix values conforming to the EIDR-PREFIX syntax\n      might be introduced\
    \ by EIDR Association in the future.  In all\n      cases, each of these additional\
    \ prefix values will be associated\n      with suffix values that conform to a\
    \ subset of the EIDR-SUFFIX\n      syntax.  These additional prefixes and their\
    \ corresponding\n      suffixes will be documented in future revisions to this\n\
    \      registration.\n      An implementation can process an EIDR-NSS with an\
    \ unknown prefix\n      as an opaque string per the \"Rules of Lexical Equivalence\"\
    \ below,\n      and resolve it as a generic DOI Name per the \"Process for\n \
    \     identifier resolution\" below.\n      When EIDR-PREFIX is equal to \"10.5240\"\
    , the syntax of EIDR-SUFFIX\n      is further constrained according to the RP2079-SUFFIX\
    \ syntax\n      specified in [SMPTERP2079]:\n                   RP2079-SUFFIX\
    \ = 5(4HEXDIG \"-\") CHECK\n                   CHECK         = DIGIT / ALPHA\n\
    \      where CHECK is the Mod 37,36 check character as specified in\n      [ISO7064],\
    \ computed over the 20 hexadecimal digits HEXDIG of\n      RP2079-SUFFIX.\n  \
    \    EXAMPLE: urn:eidr:10.5240:7791-8534-2C23-9030-8610-5\n   Relevant ancillary\
    \ documentation:\n      [ISO26234] specifies DOI Name syntax and registration.\n\
    \      [SMPTERP2079] specifies the syntax of the EIDR Identifier with the\n  \
    \    prefix \"10.5240\".\n   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n      An EIDR\
    \ Identifier is a DOI Name.  The ISO 26324 Registration\n      Authority ensures\
    \ DOI Name uniqueness; therefore, the URN-EIDR\n      derived from an EIDR Identifier\
    \ is guaranteed to be unique and\n      never reassigned.\n      Furthermore,\
    \ an EIDR Identifier is associated with a single URN-\n      EIDR.\n   Identifier\
    \ persistence considerations:\n      An EIDR Identifier is a DOI Name.  The ISO\
    \ 26324 Registration\n      Authority ensures that a DOI Name remains valid indefinitely;\n\
    \      therefore, the URN-EIDR derived from an EIDR Identifier remains\n     \
    \ valid indefinitely.\n   Process of identifier assignment:\n      EIDR Association\
    \ registers each EIDR Identifier with the ISO 26324\n      Registration Authority.\n\
    \      Entities involved in the motion picture and television industry,\n    \
    \  either directly in the production of content or in its\n      distribution\
    \ and related services, are eligible to apply for\n      registrant status.  Registrants\
    \ pay an annual membership fee that\n      depends on the size of the company.\n\
    \   Process for identifier resolution:\n      As a DOI Name, the resolution of\
    \ the EIDR Identifier associated\n      with an EIDR-NSS is handled by the ISO\
    \ 26324 Registration\n      Authority.\n      The ISO 26324 Registration Authority\
    \ operates a web service that\n      allows the EIDR Identifier associated with\
    \ an EIDR-NSS to be\n      resolved by issuing an HTTP GET request to the following\
    \ URI (see\n      [RFC7231] and [RFC2818]):\n                           \"https://doi.org/\"\
    \ URN-EIDR\n      If the EIDR Identifier exists, then an XML Schema instance\n\
    \      document (see [XMLSchema]) containing metadata associated with the\n  \
    \    EIDR Identifier is returned; otherwise, the HTTP status code \"404\n    \
    \  Not Found\" is returned.\n   EXAMPLE: https://doi.org/urn:eidr:10.5240:7791-8534-2C23-9030-8610-5\n\
    \      NOTE: The web service uses the HTTP Accept header to determine the\n  \
    \    format of the response.  When using a web browser to access the\n      resource\
    \ above, the query string \"?locatt=type:Full\" is appended\n      to the URI\
    \ to explicitly request an XML response.\n      EIDR Association operates additional\
    \ services specifically\n      tailored to EIDR users (see [EIDR-SERVICES] and\
    \ [DOI-EIDR-PROXY]).\n      These services include additional features, e.g.,\
    \ the ability to\n      register EIDR Identifiers and web-based GUI tools.\n \
    \  Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n      Lexical equivalence of the URN-EIDR is\
    \ defined by case-insensitive\n      string match.\n      NOTE: The URN-EIDR includes\
    \ the \"urn:eidr:\" string, as specified\n      under \"Declaration of syntactic\
    \ structure\".\n   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n      As specified above, the\
    \ syntax of the URN-EIDR is a subset of the\n      URN syntax specified in [RFC2141].\n\
    \   Validation mechanism:\n      The validity of an EIDR-NSS can only be guaranteed\
    \ by completing\n      the resolution process.\n      For EIDR-NSS with an EIDR-PREFIX\
    \ equal to \"10.5240\", the CHECK\n      value can be used for integrity checking,\
    \ as specified above.\n   Scope:\n      EIDR Identifiers are centrally registered,\
    \ globally unique\n      identifiers for use with audiovisual works worldwide.\n"
- title: 3.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Namespace Considerations\n   EIDR Identifiers are intended for use in Internet\
    \ applications, where\n   URNs are routinely used to identify audiovisual resources.\
    \  There is\n   no direct mapping from EIDR Identifiers to existing URN namespaces.\n"
- title: 4.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Community Considerations\n   The primary registrants of EIDR Identifiers\
    \ are producers and\n   distributors of audiovisual works, metadata aggregators,\
    \ and\n   audiovisual archives.  Any bona fide member of the ecosystem can\n \
    \  become an EIDR member and register any work.  EIDR Identifiers can be\n   used\
    \ by anyone to unambiguously identify an audiovisual asset and\n   retrieve underlying\
    \ metadata.  The primary benefits of their use are\n   associated with works in\
    \ wide distribution, management of long or\n   complex distribution chains, and\
    \ aggregation of information from\n   multiple sources.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has registered the Formal URN Namespace 'eidr'\
    \ in the \"Uniform\n   Resource Names (URN) Namespaces\" registry, using the registration\n\
    \   template in Section 2 of this document.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This document specifies the syntax of the URN-EIDR\
    \ namespace and\n   makes no security representations.  Furthermore, the details\
    \ of\n   assignment and resolution processes are defined external to this\n  \
    \ document by EIDR Association and the ISO 26324 Registration\n   Authority, and\
    \ are thus outside the scope of this document.  Note,\n   however, that failure\
    \ to conform to the syntactic and lexical\n   equivalence rules in this specification\
    \ when using an EIDR Identifier\n   as a criteria for accessing restricted resources\
    \ can result in\n   granting unauthorized access to these resources.\n"
