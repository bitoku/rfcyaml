    \          Charter for Arpanet Users Interest Working Group\n"
- title: Background
  contents:
  - "Background\n   The ARPANET Users Interest Working Group (NIC Ident = USING) was\n\
    \   formed at a meeting of 15 network people on May 23, 1973 in an\n   attempt\
    \ to improve the Network user's working environment. USING will\n   attempt to\
    \ represent the interests and needs of users in the Network\n   community, so\
    \ as to increase awareness of user requirements and\n   encourage better provision\
    \ of the neeed services. The group believes\n   that the network is moving beyond\
    \ a concentration of resources in\n   self-perpetuating research and development;\
    \ the Network is becoming a\n   service and its viability as such is dependent\
    \ on user satisfaction.\n   A second group, the ARPANET Users Group (NIC Ident\
    \ = USERS) is\n   organized as a forum for users to express their desires and\n\
    \   complaints. Acting as a steering committee and lobby for this group,\n   USING\
    \ will forward their ideas to the appropriate centers.\n"
- title: Membership
  contents:
  - "Membership\n   Group membership, in USING, is open to individuals interested\
    \ in\n   working to improve Network user support and able and willing to make\n\
    \   meaningful contributions to USING's activities.\n   Membership, in USERS,\
    \ is open to any interested person.\n"
- title: Scope
  contents:
  - "Scope\n   USING has set as its scope those facets of Network activity that\n\
    \   affect the provision of services to users. This includes the\n   availability\
    \ of resources, their reliability and ease of use.\n"
- title: Goals
  contents:
  - "Goals\n   USING's overall goal is to ensure that the ARPANET becomes a coherent\n\
    \   system in which users can regulate their own working environment\n   according\
    \ to their level of experience and the degree of transparency\n   (of specific\
    \ system idiosyncrasies) they desire.  System resources\n   should be self-documenting,\
    \ and all levels of assistance (on- and\n   off-line) should be available, again,\
    \ to be regulated by the user.\n   Short Term Objectives, for the initial 6-12\
    \ months\n    1. Specification of a user-level Common Command Language (CCL);\n\
    \    2. Specification of a Network Editor for CCL;\n    3. Further definition\
    \ and focusing of User Issues;\n    4. Encouraging establishment of a User's consulting\
    \ service;\n    5. Publication of a New-Users Handbook.\n    Long Term Activities\n\
    \    1. Monitor and/or provide impetus for user-oriented Network\n       development\
    \ efforts, including resource directories, tutorials\n       [static and dynamic],\
    \ training courses and referral services;\n    2. Provide mechanisms to encourage,\
    \ analyze, and respond to user\n       feedback;\n    3. Develop profile information\
    \ relative to users' requirements,\n       types, usage attributes, and affiliations;\n\
    \    4. Stimulate mechanisms to facilitate entry of new users to the\n       ARPANET;\n\
    \    5. Sponsor user seminars and encourage formation of viable user\n       working\
    \ groups where appropriate.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form\
