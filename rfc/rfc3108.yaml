  - "1. Introduction\n   SDP will be used in conjunction with a connection handling
    /device\n   control protocol such as Megaco (H.248) [26], SIP [18] or MGCP [25]\n
    \  to communicate the information needed to set up ATM and AAL2 bearer\n   connections.
    \ These connections include voice connections, voiceband\n   data connections,
    clear channel circuit emulation connections, video\n   connections and baseband
    data connections (such as fax relay, modem\n   relay, SSCOP, frame relay etc.).\n
    \  These conventions use standard SDP syntax as defined in RFC 2327 [1]\n   to
    describe the ATM-level and AAL-level connections, addresses and\n   other parameters.
    \ In general, parameters associated with layers\n   higher than the ATM adaptation
    layer are included only if they are\n   tightly coupled to the ATM or AAL layers.
    \ Since the syntax conforms\n   to RFC 2327, standard SDP parsers should react
    in a well-defined and\n   safe manner on receiving session descriptions based
    on the SDP\n   conventions in this document.  This is done by extending the values\n
    \  of fields defined in RFC 2327 rather than by defining new fields.\n   This
    is true for all SDP lines except the of the media attribute\n   lines, in which
    case new attributes are defined.  The SDP protocol\n   allows the definition of
    new attributes in the media attribute lines\n   which are free-form.  For the
    remaining lines, the fact that the\n   <networkType> field in an SDP descriptor
    is set to \"ATM\" should\n   preclude the misinterpretation of extended parameter
    values by RFC\n   2327-compliant SDP parsers.\n   These conventions are meant
    to address the following ATM\n   applications:\n      1. Applications in which
    a new SVC is set-up for each service\n         connection.  These SVCs could be
    AAL1 or AAL5 SVCs or single-\n         CID AAL2 SVCs.\n      2. Applications in
    which existing path resources are assigned to\n         service connections.  These
    resources could be:\n         *  AAL1/AAL5 PVCs, SPVCs or cached SVCs,\n         *
    \ AAL2 single-CID PVCs, SPVCs or cached SVCs,\n         *  CIDs within AAL2 SVCs/PVCs/SPVCs
    that multiplex multiple\n            CIDs.\n         *  Subchannels (identified
    by CIDs) within AAL1 [8] or AAL2\n            [11] SVCs/PVCs/SPVCs.\n   Note that
    the difference between PVCs and SPVCs is in the way the\n   bearer virtual circuit
    connection is set up.  SPVCs are a class of\n   PVCs that use bearer signaling,
    as opposed to node-by-node\n   provisioning, for connection establishment.\n   This
    document is limited to the case when the network type is ATM.\n   This includes
    raw RTP encapsulation [45] or voice sample\n   encapsulation [46] over AAL5 with
    no intervening IP layer.  It does\n   not address SDP usage for IP, with or without
    ATM as a lower layer.\n   In some cases, IP connection set-up is independent of
    lower layers,\n   which are configured prior to it.  For example, AAL5 PVCs that\n
    \  connect IP routers can be used for VoIP calls.  In other cases, VoIP\n   call
    set-up is closely tied to ATM-level connection set-up.  This\n   might require
    a chaining of IP and ATM descriptors, as described in\n   section 5.6.4.1.\n   This
    document makes no assumptions on who constructs the session\n   descriptions (media
    gateway, intermediate ATM/AAL2 switch, media\n   gateway controller etc.).  This
    will be different in different\n   applications.  Further, it allows the use of
    one session description\n   for both directions of a connection (as in SIP and
    MGCP applications)\n   or the use of separate session descriptions for different
    directions.\n   It also addresses the ATM multicast and anycast capabilities.\n
    \  This document makes no assumptions about how the SDP description will\n   be
    coded.  Although the descriptions shown here are encoded as text,\n   alternate
    codings are possible:\n   -  Binary encoding such as ASN.1.  This is an option
    (in addition to\n      text encoding) in the Megaco context.\n   -  Use of extended
    ISUP parameters [36] to encode the information in\n      SDP descriptors, with
    conversion to/from binary/text-based SDP\n      encoding when needed.\n"

    - "2.1  Representation of Extension Attributes\n   The SDP protocol [1] requires
      that non-standard attributes and codec\n   names use an \"X-\" prefix.\n   In
      this internet document, the \"X-\" prefix is used consistently for\n   codec
      names (Table 2) that have not been registered with the IANA.\n   The IANA-registered
      codec names listed in [31] do not use this\n   prefix, regardless of  whether
      they are statically or dynamically\n   assigned payload types.\n   However,
      this prefix is not used for the extension SDP attributes\n   defined in this
      document.  This has been done to enhance legibility.\n   This document suggests
      that parsers be flexible in the use of the\n   \"X-\" prefix convention.  They
      should accept codec names and attribute\n   names with or without the \"X-\"
      prefix.\n"

    - "2.2 Representation of Parameter Values\n   Depending on the format of their
      representation in SDP, the\n   parameters defined in this document fall into
      the following classes:\n   (1) Parameters always represented in a decimal format.\n
      \  (2) Parameters always represented in a hexadecimal format.\n   (3) Parameters
      always represented as character strings.\n   (4) Parameters that can be represented
      in either decimal or\n       hexadecimal format.\n   No prefixes are needed
      for classes 1 - 3, since the format is fixed.\n   For class 4, a \"0x\" prefix
      shall always be used to differentiate the\n   hexadecimal from the decimal format.\n
      \  For both decimal and hex representations, if the underlying bit field\n   is
      smaller or larger than the binary equivalent of the SDP\n   representation,
      then leading 0 bits should be added or removed as\n   needed.  Thus, 3 and 0x3
      translate into the following five-bit\n   pattern: 0 0011.  The SDP representations
      0x12 and 18 translate into\n   the following five-bit pattern: 1 0010.\n   Leading
      0 digits shall not be used in decimal representations.\n   Generally, these
      are also not used in hexadecimal representations.\n   Exceptions are when an
      exact number of hex digits is expected, as in\n   the case of NSAP addresses.
      \ Parsers shall not reject leading zeros\n   in hex values.\n   Both single-character
      and multi-character string values are enclosed\n   in double quotes (i.e., \").
      \ By contrast, single quotes (i.e., ') are\n   used for emphasizing keywords
      rather than to refer to characters or\n   strings.\n   In the text representation
      of decimal and hex numbers, digits to the\n   left are more significant than
      digits to the right.\n"
    title: 2.2 Representation of Parameter Values
  - contents:
    - "2.3 Directionality Convention\n   This section defined the meaning of the terms
      'forward' and\n   'backward' as used in this document.  This is specially applicable
      to\n   parameters that have a specific direction associated with them.\n   In
      this document, 'forward' refers to the direction away from the ATM\n   node
      under consideration, while 'backward' refers to the direction\n   towards the
      ATM node.  This convention must be used in all SDP-based\n   session descriptions
      regardless of whether underlying bearer is an\n   SVC, a dynamically allocated
      PVC/SPVC or a dynamically allocated CID.\n   This is regardless of which side
      originates the service connection.\n   If ATM SVC or AAL2 Q.2630.1 signaling
      is used, the directionality\n   convention is independent of which side originates
      the SVC or AAL2\n   connection.\n   This provides a simple way of identifying
      the direction in which a\n   parameter is applicable, in a manner that is independent
      of the\n   underlying ATM or AAL2 bearer.  This simplicity comes at a price,\n
      \  described below.\n   The convention used by all ATM/AAL2 signaling specifications
      (e.g.,\n   Q.2931 Section 1.3.3 and Q.2630.1) mandates that forward direction
      is\n   from the end initiating setup/establishment via bearer signaling\n   towards
      the end receiving the setup/establishment request.  The\n   backward direction
      is in the opposite direction.  In some cases, the\n   'forward' and 'backward'
      directions of the ATM signaling convention\n   might be the exact opposite of
      the SDP convention described above,\n   requiring the media gateway to perform
      the necessary translation.  An\n   example case in which this is needed is described
      below.\n   Consider an SDP description sent by a media gateway controller to
      the\n   gateway originating a service-level call.  In the backward SVC call\n
      \  set-up model, this gateway terminates (rather than originates) an SVC\n   call.
      \ The media gateway refers to the traffic descriptor (and hence\n   the PCR)
      in the direction away from this gateway as the forward\n   traffic descriptor
      and forward PCR.  Clearly, this is at odds with\n   ATM SVC signaling which
      refers to this very PCR as the backward PCR.\n   The gateway needs to be able
      to perform the required swap of\n   directions.  In this example, the media
      gateway terminating the\n   service level call (and hence originating the SVC
      call) does not need\n   to perform this swap.\n   Certain parameters within
      attributes are defined exclusively for the\n   forward or  backward directions.
      \ Examples for the forward direction\n   are the <fsssar> subparameter within
      the 'aal2sscs3661unassured'\n   media attribute line, the <fsssar>, <fsscopsdu>
      and <fsscopuu>\n   subparameters within the 'aal2sscs3661assured' media attribute
      line,\n   the <fsscopsdu> and <fsscopuu> subparameters within the 'aal5sscop'\n
      \  media attribute line, and the <fmaxFrame> parameter within the\n   'aal2sscs3662'
      media attribute line.  Examples for the backward\n   direction are the <bsssar>
      subparameter within the\n   'aal2sscs3661unassured' media attribute line, the
      <bsssar>,\n   <bsscopsdu> and <bsscopuu> subparameters within the\n   'aal2sscs3661assured'
      media attribute line, the <bsscopsdu> and\n   <bsscopuu> subparameters within
      the 'aal5sscop' media attribute line,\n   and the <bmaxFrame> parameter within
      the 'aal2sscs3662' media\n   attribute line.\n"

    - "2.4 Case convention\n   As defined in RFC 2327 [1], SDP syntax is case-sensitive.
      \ Since\n   these ATM conventions conform strictly with SDP syntax, they are\n
      \  case-sensitive.  SDP line types (e.g., \"c\", \"m\", \"o\", \"a\") and fields\n
      \  in the SDP lines should be built according to the case conventions in\n   [1]
      and in this document.  It is suggested, but not required, that\n   SDP parsers
      for ATM applications be case-tolerant where ignoring case\n   does not result
      in ambiguity.  Encoding names, which are defined\n   outside the SDP protocol,
      are case-insensitive.\n"

    - "2.5 Use of special characters in SDP parameter values\n   In general, RFC 2327-conformant
      string values of SDP parameters [1]\n   do not include special characters that
      are neither alphabets nor\n   digits.  An exception is the \"/\" character used
      in the value\n   \"RTP/AVP\" of transport sub-field of the 'm' line.\n   String
      values used in SDP descriptions of ATM connections retain this\n   convention,
      while allowing the use of the special character \"/\" in a\n   manner commensurate
      with [1].  In addition, the special characters\n   \"$\" and \"-\" are used
      in the following manner.  A \"$\" value is a\n   wildcard that allows the recipient
      of the SDP description to select\n   any permitted value of the parameter.  A
      \"-\" value indicates that it\n   is not necessary to specify the value of the
      parameter in the SDP\n   description because this parameter is irrelevant for
      this\n   application, or because its value can be known from another source\n
      \  such as provisioning, defaults, another protocol, another SDP\n   descriptor
      or another part of the same SDP descriptor.  If the use of\n   these special
      characters is construed as a violation of RFC 2327 [1]\n   syntax, then reserved
      string values can be used.  The string \"CHOOSE\"\n   can be used in lieu of
      \"$\".  The string \"OMIT\" can be used in lieu of\n   \"-\" for an omitted
      parameter.\n"

    in section 1, the SDP conventions\n   in this document provide the following session
    control capabilities:\n      *  Identification of the underlying bearer network
    type as ATM.\n      *  Identification by an ATM network element of its own address,
    in\n         one of several possible formats.  A connection peer can\n         initiate
    SVC set-up to this address.  A call agent or\n         connection peer can select
    an pre-established bearer path to\n         this address.\n      *  Identification
    of the ATM bearer connection that is to be bound\n         to the service-level
    connection.  Depending on the application,\n         this is either a VCC or a
    subchannel (identified by a CID)\n         within a VCC.\n      * Identification
    of media type: audio, video, data.\n      *  In AAL1/AAL5  applications, declaration
    of a set of payload\n         types that can be bound to the ATM bearer connection.
    \ The\n         encoding names and payload types defined for use in the RTP\n
    \        context [31] are re-used for AAL1 and AAL5, if applicable.\n      *  In
    AAL2 applications, declaration of a set of profiles that can\n         be bound
    to the ATM bearer connection.  A mechanism for\n         dynamically defining
    custom profiles within the SDP session\n         description is included.  This
    allows the use of custom\n         profiles for connections that span multi-network
    interfaces.\n      *  A means of correlating service-level connections with\n
    \        underlying ATM bearer connections.  The backbone network\n         connection
    identifier or bnc-id specified in ITU Q.1901 [36]\n         standardization work
    is used for this purpose.  In order to\n         provide a common SDP base for
    applications based on Q.1901 and\n         SIP/SIP+, the neutral term 'eecid'
    is used in lieu of 'bnc-id'\n         in the SDP session descriptor.\n      *
    \ A means of  mapping codec types and packetization periods into\n         service
    types (voice, voiceband data and facsimile).  This is\n         useful in determining
    the encoding to use when the connection\n         is upspeeded in response to
    modem or facsimile tones.\n      *  A means of describing the adaptation type,
    QoS class, ATM\n         transfer capability/service category, broadband bearer

  - "4. Format of the ATM Session Description\n   The sequence of lines in the session
    descriptions in this document\n   conforms to RFC 2327 [1].  In general, a session
    description consists\n   of a  session-level part followed by zero or more media-level
    parts.\n   ATM session descriptions consist of a session-level part followed by\n
    \  one or two media-level parts.  The only two media applicable are the\n   ATM
    bearer medium and RTCP control (where applicable).\n   The session level part
    consists of the following lines:\n   v=  (protocol version, zero or one line)\n
    \  o=  (origin, zero or one line)\n   s=  (session name, zero or one line)\n   c=
    \ (connection information, one line)\n   b=  (bandwidth, zero or more lines)\n
    \  t=  (timestamp, zero or one line)\n   k=  (encryption key, zero or one line)\n
    \  In ATM session descriptions, there are no media attribute lines in\n   the
    session level part.  These are present in the media-level parts.\n   The media-level
    part for the ATM bearer consists of the following\n   lines:\n   m=  (media information
    and transport address, one line)\n   b=  (bandwidth, zero or more lines)\n   k=
    \ (encryption key, zero or more lines)\n   a=  (media attribute, zero or more
    lines)\n   The media-level part for RTCP control consists of the following\n   lines:\n
    \  m=  (media information and transport address, one line)\n   c=  (connection
    information for control only, one line)\n   In general, the 'v', 'o', 's', and
    't' lines are mandatory.  However,\n   in the Megaco [26] context, these lines
    have been made optional.  The\n   'o', 's', and 't' lines are omitted in most
    MGCP [25] applications.\n   Note that SDP session descriptors for ATM can contain
    bandwidth (b=)\n   and encryption key (k=) lines.  Like all other lines, these
    lines\n   should strictly conform to the SDP standard [1].\n   The bandwidth (b=)
    line is not necessarily redundant in the ATM\n   context since, in some applications,
    it can be used to convey\n   application-level information which does not map
    directly into the\n   atmTrfcDesc media attribute line.  For instance, the 'b'
    line can be\n   used in SDP descriptors in RTSP commands to describe content\n
    \  bandwidth.\n   The encryption key line (k=) can be used to indicate an encryption\n
    \  key for the bearer, and a method to obtain the key.  At present, the\n   encryption
    of ATM and AAL2 bearers has not been conventionalized,\n   unlike the encryption
    of RTP payloads.  Nor has the authentication or\n   encryption of ATM or AAL2
    bearer signaling.  In the ATM and AAL2\n   contexts, the term 'bearer' can include
    'bearer signaling' as well as\n   'bearer payloads'.\n   The order of lines in
    an ATM session description is exactly in the\n   RFC 2327-conformant order depicted
    above.  However, there is no order\n   of the media attribute ('a') lines with
    respect to other 'a' lines.\n   The SDP protocol version for session descriptions
    using these\n   conventions is 0.  In conformance with standard SDP, it  is strongly\n
    \  recommended that the 'v' line be included at the beginning of each\n   SDP
    session description.  In some contexts such as Megaco, the\n   'v' line is optional
    and may be omitted unless several session\n   descriptions are provided in sequence,
    in which case the 'v' line\n   serves as a delimiter.  Depending on the application,
    sequences of\n   session descriptions might refer to:\n   -  Different connections
    or sessions.\n   -  Alternate ways of realizing the same connection or session.\n
    \  -  Different layers of the same session (section 5.6.4.1).\n   The 'o', 's'
    and 't' lines are included for strict conformance with\n   RFC 2327.  It is possible
    that these lines might not carry useful\n   information in some ATM-based applications.
    \ Therefore, some\n   applications might omit these lines, although it is recommended
    that\n   they not do so.  For maximum interoperability, it is preferable that\n
    \  SDP parsers not reject session descriptions that do not contain these\n   lines.\n"

  - contents:
    - "5.1 The Origin Line\n   The origin line for an ATM-based session is structured
      as follows:\n         o=<username> <sessionID> <version> <networkType>\n           <addressType>
      <address>\n   The <username> is set to \"-\".\n   The <sessionID> can be  set
      to one of the following:\n      *  an NTP timestamp referring to the moment
      when the SDP session\n         descriptor was created.\n      *  a Call ID,
      connection ID or context ID that uniquely identifies\n         the session within
      the scope of the ATM node.  Since calls can\n         comprise multiple connections
      (sessions), call IDs are\n         generally not suitable for this purpose.\n
      \  NTP time stamps can be represented as decimal or hex integers.  The\n   part
      of the NTP timestamp that refers to an integer number of seconds\n   is sufficient.
      \ This is a 32-bit field\n   On the other hand, call IDs, connection IDs and
      context IDs can be\n   can be 32 hex digits long.\n   The <sessionID> field
      is represented as a decimal or hex number of up\n   to 32 digits.  A \"0x\"
      prefix is used before the hex representation.\n   The <version> refers to the
      version of the SDP session descriptor\n   (not that of the SDP protocol).  This
      is can be set to one of the\n   following:\n      *  0.\n      *  an NTP timestamp
      referring to the moment when the SDP session\n         descriptor was modified.
      \ If the SDP session descriptor has not\n         been modified by an intermediate
      entity (such as an MGC), then\n         the <version> timestamp will be the
      same as the <sessionId>\n         timestamp, if any.  As with the <sessionId>,
      only the integer\n         part of the NTP timestamp is used.\n   When equated
      to the integer part of an NTP timestamp, the <version>\n   field is 10 digits
      wide.  This is more restricted than [1], which\n   allows unlimited size.  As
      in [1], the most significant digit is\n   non-zero when an NTP timestamp is
      used.\n   The <networkType> in SDP session descriptions for ATM applications\n
      \  should be assigned the string value \"ATM\" or wildcarded to a \"$\" or\n
      \  \"-\".\n   The <addressType> and <address>  parameters are identical to those\n
      \  for the connection information ('c') line (Section 5.3).  Each of\n   these
      parameters can be wildcarded per the conventions described for\n   the 'c' line
      in Section 5.3.  These parameters should not me omitted\n   since this would
      violate SDP syntax [1].\n   As with the 'c' line, SDP parsers are not expected
      to check the\n   consistency of <networkType> with <addressType>, <address>
      pairs.\n   The <addressType> and <address> need to be consistent with each\n

    - "5.3 The Connection Information Line\n   In general, the connection information
      line [1] is structured as\n   follows:\n        c=<networkType> <addressType>
      <address>\n   For ATM networks, additional values of <networkType>, <addressType>\n
      \  and <address> are defined, over and above those listed in [1].  The\n   ABNF
      syntax (Section 9) for ATM SDP does not limit the ways in which\n   <networkType>
      can be combined with <addressType>, <address> pairs.\n   However, some combinations
      will not be valid in certain applications,\n   while others will never be valid.
      \ Invalid combinations should be\n   rejected by application-specific functions,
      and not by generic\n   parsers.  The ABNF syntax does limit the ways in which
      <addressType>\n   and <address> can be paired.\n   For ATM networks, the value
      of <networkType> should be set to \"ATM\".\n   Further, this may be wildcarded
      to \"$\" or \"-\".  If this is done, an\n   node using ATM as the basic transport
      mechanism will select a value\n   of \"ATM\".  A node that interfaces with multiple
      network types (\"IN\",\n   \"ATM\" etc.) that include ATM can also choose a
      value of \"ATM\".\n   When the SDP description is built by a node such as a
      media gateway,\n   the <address> refers to the address of the node building
      the SDP\n   description.  When this description is forwarded to another node,
      it\n   still contains the original node's address.  When the media gateway\n
      \  controller builds part or all of the SDP description, the local\n   descriptor
      contains the address of the local node, while the remote\n   descriptor contains
      the address of the remote node.  If the <address>\n   and/or <addressType> are
      irrelevant or are known by other means, they\n   can be set to a \"$\" or a
      \"-\", as described below.\n   Additionally, in all contexts, the 'm' line can
      have an ATM address\n   in the <virtualConnectionId> subparameter which, if
      present, is the\n   remote address if the 'c' line address is local, and vice
      versa.\n   For ATM networks, the <addressType> can be NSAP, E164 or GWID\n   (ALIAS).
      \ For ATM networks, the <address> syntax depends on the\n   syntax of the <addressType>.
      \ SDP parsers should check the\n   consistency of <addressType> with <address>.\n
      \  NSAP: If the addressType is NSAP, the address is expressed in the\n   standard
      dotted hex form.  This is a string of 40 hex digits, with\n   dots after the
      2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, 18th, 22nd, 26th, 30th, 34th and\n   38th digits.  The
      last octet of the NSAP address is the 'selector'\n   field that is available
      for non-standard use.  An example of a line\n   with an NSAP address is:\n       c=ATM
      NSAP 47.0091.8100.0000.0060.3e64.fd01.0060.3e64.fd01.00\n   A \"0x\" prefix
      shall not be used in this case since this is always in\n   hexadecimal format.\n
      \  E164: If the addressType is E164, the address is expressed as a\n   decimal
      number  with up to 15 digits.  For example:\n        c=ATM E164 9738294382\n
      \  The use of E.164 numbers in the B-ISDN context is defined in ITU\n   E.191.
      \ There is a disparity between the ATM forum and the ITU in the\n   use of E.164
      numbers for ATM addressing.  The ATM forum (e.g., UNI\n   Signaling 4.0) allows
      only International Format E.164 numbers, while\n   the ITU (e.g., Q.2931) allows
      private numbering plans.  Since the\n   goal of this SDP specification is to
      interoperate with all bearer\n   signaling protocols, it allows the use of numbers
      that do not conform\n   to the E.164 International Format.  However, to maximize
      overall\n   consistency, network administrators can restrict the provisioning
      of\n   numbers to the E.164 International Format.\n   GWID (ALIAS): If the addressType
      is GWID, it means that the address\n   is a Gateway Identifier or Node Alias.
      \ This may or may not be\n   globally unique.  In this format, the address is
      expressed as an\n   alphanumeric string (\"A\"-\"Z\", \"a\"-\"z\", \"0\" - \"9\",\".\",\"-\",\"_\").
      \ For\n   example:\n       c=ATM GWID officeABCmgx101vism12\n   Since these
      SDP conventions can be used for more than gateways, the\n   string \"ALIAS\"
      can be used instead of \"GWID\" in the 'c' line.  Thus,\n   the example above
      is equivalent to:\n       c=ATM ALIAS officeABCmgx101vism12\n   An example of
      a GWID (ALIAS)is the CLLI code used for telecom\n   equipment.  For all practical
      purposes, it should be adequate for the\n   GWID (ALIAS) to be a variable length
      string with a maximum size of 32\n   characters.\n   The connection information
      line is always present in an SDP session\n   descriptor.  However, each of the
      parameters on this line can be\n   wildcarded to a \"$\" or a \"-\", independently
      of whether other\n   parameters on this line are wildcarded or not.  Not all
      syntactically\n   legal wildcard combinations are meaningful in a particular\n
      \  application.\n   Examples of meaningful wildcard combinations in the ATM
      context are:\n         c=- - -\n         c=$ $ $\n         c=ATM - -\n         c=ATM
      $ $\n         c=ATM <addressType> -\n         c=ATM <addressType> $\n   Specifying
      the ATM address type without specifying the ATM address is\n   useful when the
      recipient is asked to select an ATM address of a\n   certain type (NSAP, E.164
      etc.).\n   Examples of syntactically legal wildcard combinations of dubious\n
      \  utility are:\n         c=- $ -\n         c=- $ $\n         c=- <addressType>
      -\n         c=$ <addressType> $\n         c=- <addressType> <address>\n         c=$
      <addressType> <address>\n   Note that <addressType> and/or <address> should
      not omitted without\n   being set to a \"-\" or \"$\" since this would violate
      basic SDP syntax\n   [1].\n"

        are limited to ATM-specific values.\n   The <vpi>, <vci> and <cid> are the
        Virtual Path Identifier, Virtual\n   Circuit Identifier and Channel Identifier
        respectively. The <vpi> is\n   an 8 or 12 bit field. The <vci> is a 16-bit
        field. The <cid> is an\n   8-bit field ([8] and [11]). For AAL1 applications,
        it corresponds to\n   the channel number defined in Annex C of [8].\n   The
        <vpci> is a 16-bit field defined in Section 4.5.16 of ITU Q.2931\n   [Ref.
        15].  The <vpci> is similar to the <vpi>, except for its width\n   and the
        fact that it retains its value across VP crossconnects.  In\n   some applications,
        the size of the <vpci> is the same as the size of\n   the <vpi> (8 or 12 bits).
        \ In this case, the most significant 8 or 4\n   bits are ignored.\n   The
        <vcci> is a 16-bit field defined in ITU Recommendation Q.2941.2\n   [32].
        \ The <vcci> is similar to the <vci>, except for the fact that\n   it retains
        its value across VC crossconnects.\n   In general, <vpci> and <vcci> values
        are unique between a pair of\n   nodes.  When they are unique between a pair
        of nodes but not unique\n   within a network, they need to be qualified, at
        any node, by the ATM\n   address of the remote node.  These parameters can
        be pre-provisioned\n   or signaled.  When signaled, the <vpci> is encapsulated
        in the\n   connection identifier information element of SVC signaling messages.\n
        \  The <vcci> is encapsulated in the Generic Information Transport (GIT)\n
        \  information element of SVC signaling messages.  In an ATM node pair,\n
        \  either node can assign <vcci> values and signal it to the other end\n   via
        SVC signaling.  A glare avoidance scheme is defined in [32] and\n   [44].
        \ This mechanism works in SVC applications.  A different glare\n   avoidance
        technique is needed when a pool of existing PVCs/SPVCs is\n   dynamically
        assigned to calls.  One such scheme for glare reduction\n   is the assignment
        of <vcci> values from different ends of the <vcci>\n   range, using the lowest
        or highest available value as applicable.\n   When <vpci> and <vcci> values
        are pre-provisioned, administrations\n   have the option of provisioning them
        uniquely in a network.  In this\n   case, the ATM address of the far end is
        not needed to qualify these\n   parameters.\n   In the AAL2 context, the definition
        of a VCC implies that there is no\n   CID-level switching between its ends.
        \ If either end can assign <cid>\n   values, then a glare reduction mechanism
        is needed.  One such scheme\n   for glare reduction is the assignment of <cid>
        values from different\n   ends of the <cid> range, using the lowest or highest
        available value\n   as applicable.\n   The <portId> parameter is used to identify
        the physical trunk port on\n   an ATM module.  It can be represented as a
        hexadecimal number of up\n   to 32 hex digits.\n   In some applications, it
        is meaningful to bundle a set of connections\n   between a pair of ATM nodes

        a \"$\".\n      *  <address> is replaced with a \"$\", but <addressType> is
        not.\n   Examples of wildcarding the <virtualConnectionId> in the AAL1 and\n
        \  AAL5 contexts are: $, VCCI-$, BCG-100/VPI-20/VCI-$.  Examples of\n   wildcarding

        \  In H.323 Annex C applications [45], the <transport> parameter has a\n   value

        over AAL5 per [45] can be indicated explicitly via\n   the aalApp media attribute.\n
        \  A value of \"AAL1/custom\", \"AAL2/custom\" or \"AAL5/custom\" for the\n

        considered equivalent to\n   the value \"AAL1/ATMF\" defined above.  \"AAL1/AVP\"
        is unsuitable\n   because the AVP profile is closely tied to RTP.\n   An example
        'm' line use for audio media over AAL1 is:\n      m=audio VCCI-27 AAL1/ATMF
        0\n   This indicates the use of an AAL1 VCC with VCCI=24 to carry PCMU\n   audio
        that is encapsulated according to ATMF's af-vtoa-78 [7].\n   Another example
        of the use of the 'm' line use for audio media over\n   AAL1 is:\n      m=audio
        $  AAL1/ATMF 0 8\n   This indicates that any AAL1 VCC may be used.  If it
        exists already,\n   then its selection is subject to glare rules.  The audio
        media on\n   this VCC is encapsulated according to ATMF's af-vtoa-78 [7].

        \                   <payloadType#2>...<payloadType #n>\n   For example:\n

        \        a=aalType:AAL5\n         a=aalApp:itu_h323c - -\n   implies that
        any VCI on VPI= 3 of trunk port #9 may be used.  This VC\n   encapsulates
        RTP packets directly on AAL5 per [45].  The 'rtpmap'\n   (rather than the
        'atmmap') attribute is used to dynamically map the\n   payload type of 96
        into the codec name X-G727-32 (Table 2).  This\n   name represents 32 kbps
        EADPCM.\n   The 'm' line for AAL5-based video media can be constructed as\n
        \  follows:\n      m=video <virtualConnectionId> AAL5/ITU  <payloadType#1>\n
        \               <payloadType#2>...<payloadType #n>\n   In this case, the use
        of AAL5/ITU as the transport points to H.222.1\n   as the controlling standard
        [51].  An example 'm' line use for video\n   media is:\n      m=video PORT-9/VPI-3/VCI-$
        \ AAL5/ITU  33\n   This indicates that any VCI on VPI= 3 of trunk port #9
        may be used.\n   The video media on this VCC is encapsulated according to
        ITU-T\n   H.222.1 [51].  The encoding scheme is an MPEG 2 transport stream\n
        \  (\"MP2T\" in Table 1).  This is statically mapped per [31] to a payload\n
        \  type of 33.\n   Using the parameter definitions in the previous subsections,
        the\n   media information line for AAL2-based audio media can be constructed\n

      - "m=<media> <virtualConnectionId> <transport#1> <format list#1>\n        <transport#2>
        <format list#2> ... <transport#M> <format list#M>\n   where <format list#i>
        has the form <profile#i_1>...<profile#i_N>\n   Unlike the 'm' line for AAL1
        or AAL5 applications, the 'm' line for\n   AAL2 applications can have multiple
        <transport> parameters, each\n   followed by a <format list>.  This is because
        it is possible to\n   consider definitions from multiple sources (ATMF, ITU
        and non-\n   standard documents) when selecting AAL2 profile to be bound to
        a\n   connection.\n   In most applications, the ordering of profiles implies
        a preference\n   (preferred profiles before less favored ones).  Therefore,
        there can\n   be multiple instances of the same <transport> value in the same
        'm'\n   line.\n   An example 'm' line use for audio media over AAL2 is:\n
        \     m=audio VCCI-27/CID-19 AAL2/ITU 7 AAL2/custom 100 AAL2/ITU 1\n   This
        indicates the use of CID #19 on VCCI #27 to carry audio.  It\n   provides
        a preferential list of profiles for this connection: profile\n   AAL2/ITU
        7 defined in [13], AAL2/custom 100 defined in an\n   application-specific
        or interoperability document and profile\n   AAL2/ITU 1 defined in [13].\n
        \  Another example of the use of the 'm' line use for audio media over\n   AAL2
        is:\n      m=audio VCCI-$/CID-$  AAL2/ATMF 6 8\n   This indicates that any
        AAL2 CID may be used, subject to any\n   applicable glare avoidance/reduction
        rules.  The profiles that can be\n   bound to this connection are AAL2/ATMF
        6 defined in af-vtoa-0113.000\n   [44] and AAL2/ATMF 8 defined in af-vmoa-0145.000
        [52].  These sources\n   use non-overlapping profile number ranges.  The profiles
        they define\n   fall under the <transport> category \"AAL2/ATMF\".  This application\n
        \  does not order profiles preferentially.  This rule is known a priori.\n
        \  It is not embedded in the 'm' line.\n   Another example of the use of the
        'm' line use for audio media over\n   AAL2 is:\n      m=audio VCCI-20/CID-$
        \ AAL2/xyzCorporation 11\n   AAL2 VCCs in this application are single-CID
        VCCs.  Therefore, it is\n   possible to wildcard the CID.  The single-CID
        VCC with VCCI=20 is\n   selected.  The AAL2 profile to be used is AAL2/xyzCorporation
        11\n   defined by xyzCorporation.\n   In some applications, an \"-\" can be
        used in lieu of:\n   -  <format list>\n   -  <transport> and <format list>\n
        \  This implies that these parameters are irrelevant or are known by\n   other
        means (such as defaults).  For example:\n         m=audio VCCI-234 - -\n         a=aalType:AAL1\n
        \  indicates the use of VCCI=234 with AAL1 adaptation and unspecified\n   encoding.\n
        \  In another example application, the 'aal2sscs3662' attribute can\n   indicate
        <faxDemod> = \"on\" and any other competing options as \"off\",\n   and the
        <aalType> attribute can indicate AAL2.  Thus:\n      m=audio VCCI-123/CID-5
        - -\n      a=aalType:AAL2\n      a=aal2sscs3662:audio off off on off on off
        off off - - -\n   Besides indicating an audio medium, a VCCI of 123 and a
        CID of 5, the\n   'm' line indicates an unspecified profile.  The media attribute
        lines\n   indicate an adaptation layer of AAL2, and the use of the audio SAP\n
        \  [13] to carry demodulated facsimile.\n   The media information line for
        \"data\" media has one of the following\n   the following formats:\n      m=data
        <virtualConnectionId> - -\n      m=data - - -\n   The data could be circuit
        emulation data carried over AAL1 or AAL2,\n   or packet data carried over
        AAL5.  Media attribute lines, rather than\n   the 'm' line, are used to indicate
        the adaptation type for the data\n   media.  Examples of the representation
        of data media are listed\n   below.\n         m=data  PORT-7/VPI-6/VCI-$  -
        -\n         a=aalApp:AAL5_SSCOP-                             -\n   implies
        that any VCI on VPI= 6 of trunk port #7 may be used.  This VC\n   uses SSCOP
        on AAL5 to transport data.\n         m=data  PORT-7/VPI-6/VCI-50  - -\n         a=aalType:AAL1_SDT\n
        \        a=sbc:6\n   implies that VCI 50 on VPI 6 on port 7 uses structured
        AAL1 to\n   transfer 6 x 64 kbps circuit emulation data.  This may be alternately\n
        \  represented as:\n         m=data  PORT-7/VPI-6/VCI-50  - -\n         b=AS:384\n
        \        a=aalType:AAL1_SDT\n   The following lines:\n         m=data VCCI-123/CID-5
        - -\n         a=aalType:AAL2\n         a=sbc:2\n   imply that CID 5 of VCCI
        123 is used to transfer 2 x 64 kbps circuit\n   emulation data.\n   In the
        AAL1 context, it is also permissible to represent circuit mode\n   data as
        an \"audio\" codec.  If this is done, the codec types used are\n   X-CCD or
        X-CCD-CAS.  These encoding names are dynamically mapped into\n   payload types
        through the 'atmmap' attribute.  For example:\n         m=audio VCCI-27 AAL1/AVP
        98\n         a=atmmap:98 X-CCD\n         a=sbc:6\n   implies that AAL1 VCCI=27
        is used for 6 x 64 transmission.\n   In the AAL2 context, the X-CCD codec
        can be assigned a profile type\n   and number.  Even though it is not possible
        to construct a profile\n   table as described in ITU I.366.2 for this \"codec\",
        it is preferable\n   to adopt the common AAL2 profile convention in its case.
        \ An example\n   AAL2 profile mapping for the X-CCD codec could be as follows:\n
        \     PROFILE TYPE         PROFILE NUMBER        \"CODEC\" (ONLY ONE)\n        \"custom\"
        \               200                     X-CCD\n   The profile does not identify

    - "5.6 The Media Attribute Lines\n   In an SDP line sequence, the media information
      line 'm' is followed\n   by one or more media attribute or 'a' lines.  Media
      attribute lines\n   are per the format below:\n      a=<attribute>:<value>\n
      \  or\n      a=<value>\n   In general, media attribute lines are optional except
      when needed to\n   qualify the media information line.  This qualification is
      necessary\n   when the \"m\" line for an AAL1 or AAL5 session specifies a payload\n
      \  type that needs to be dynamically mapped.  The 'atmmap' media\n   attribute
      line defined below is used for this purpose.\n   In attribute lines, subparameters
      that are meant to be left\n   unspecified are set to a \"-\".  These are generally
      inapplicable or,\n   if applicable, are known by other means such as provisioning.
      \ In\n   some cases, a media attribute line with all parameters set to \"-\"\n
      \  carries no information and should be preferably omitted.  In other\n   cases,
      such as the 'lij' media attribute line, the very presence of\n   the media attribute
      line conveys meaning.\n   There are no restrictions placed by RFC 2327 [1] regarding
      the order\n   of 'a' lines with respect to other 'a' lines.  However, these
      lines\n   must not contradict each other or the other SDP lines.\n   Inconsistencies
      are not to be ignored and should be flagged as\n   errors.  Repeated media attribute
      lines can carry additional\n   information.  These should not be inconsistent
      with each other.\n   Applications will selectively use the optional media attribute
      lines\n   listed below.  This is meant to be an exhaustive list for describing\n
      \  the general attributes of ATM bearer networks.\n   The base specification
      for SDP, RFC 2327 [1], allows the definition f\n   new attributes.  In keeping
      with this spirit, some of the attributes\n   defined in this document can also
      be used in SDP descriptions of IP\n   nd other non-ATM sessions.  For example,
      the 'vsel', 'dsel' and\n   'fsel' attributes defined below refer generically
      to codec-s.  These\n   can be bed for service-specific codec negotiation and
      assignment in\n   non-ATM s well as ATM applications.\n   SDP media attributes
      defined in this document for use in the ATM\n   context are classified as:\n
      \     *  ATM bearer connection attributes (Section 5.6.1)\n      *  AAL attributes
      (Section 5.6.2)\n      *  Service attributes (Section 5.6.3).\n      *  Miscellaneous
      media attributes, that cannot be classified as\n         ATM, AAL or service
      attributes (Section 5.6.4).\n   In addition to these, the SDP attributes defined
      in [1] can also be\n   used in the ATM context.  Examples are:\n      *  The
      attributes defined in RFC 2327 which allow indication of\n         the direction
      in which a session is active.  These are\n         a=sendonly, a=recvonly, a=sendrecv,
      a=inactive.\n      *  The 'Ptime' attribute defined in RFC 2327.  It indicates
      the\n         packet period.  It is not recommended that this attribute be\n
      \        used in ATM applications since packet period information is\n         provided
      with other parameters (e.g., the profile type and\n         number in the 'm'
      line, and the 'vsel', 'dsel' and 'fsel'\n         attributes).  Also, for AAL1
      applications, 'ptime' is not\n         applicable and should be flagged as an
      error.  If used in AAL2\n         and AAL5 applications, 'ptime' should be consistent
      with the\n         rest of the SDP description.\n      *  The 'fmtp' attribute
      used to designate format-specific\n         parameters.\n"

        attribute.  This stands for 'end-to-end connection\n         identifier'.
        \ It provides a means of correlating service-level\n         connections with
        underlying ATM bearer connections.  In the\n         Q.1901 [36] context,
        the eecid is synonymous with the bnc-id\n         (backbone network connection
        identifier).\n      *  The 'aalType' attribute.  This is used to indicate
        the nature\n         of the ATM adaptation layer (AAL).\n      *  The 'capability'
        attribute, which indicates the ATM transfer\n         capability (ITU nomenclature),
        synonymous with the ATM Service\n         Category (ATMF nomenclature).\n
        \     *  The 'qosClass' attribute, which indicates the QoS class of the\n
        \        ATM bearer connection.\n      *  The 'bcob' attribute, which indicates
        the broadband connection\n         oriented bearer class, and whether end-to-end
        timing is\n         required.\n      *  The 'stc' attribute, which indicates
        susceptibility to\n         clipping.\n      *  The 'upcc' attribute, which
        indicates the user plane connection\n         configuration.\n      *  The
        'atmQOSparms' attribute, which is used to describe certain\n         key ATM
        QoS parameters.\n      *  The 'atmTrfcDesc' attribute, which is used to describe
        ATM\n         traffic descriptor parameters.\n      *  The 'abrParms' attribute,
        which is used to describe  ABR-\n         specific parameters.  These parameters
        are per the UNI 4.0\n         signaling  specification [5].\n      *  The
        'abrSetup' attribute, which is used to indicate the ABR\n         parameters
        needed during call/connection establishment.\n      *  The 'bearerType' attribute,
        which is used to indicate whether\n         the underlying bearer is an ATM
        PVC/SPVC, an ATM SVC, or a\n         subchannel within an existing ATM SVC/PVC/SPVC.\n
        \     *  The 'lij' attribute, which is used to indicate the presence of\n
        \        a connection that uses the Leaf-initiated-join capability\n         described
        in UNI 4.0 [5], and to optionally describe parameters\n         associated
        with this capability.\n      *  The 'anycast' attribute, which is used to
        indicate the\n         applicability of the anycast function described in
        UNI 4.0 [5],\n         and to optionally qualify it with certain parameters.\n
        \     *  The 'cache' attribute, which is used to enable SVC caching and\n
        \        to specify an inactivity timer for SVC release.\n      *  The 'bearerSigIE'
        attribute, which can be used to represent ITU\n         Q-series information
        elements in bit-map form.  This is useful\n         in describing parameters
        that are not closely coupled to the\n         ATM and AAL layers.  Examples
        are the B-HLI and B-LLI IEs\n         specified in ITU Q.2931 [15], and the

        - "5.6.1.1 The 'eecid' attribute\n   The 'eecid' attribute is synonymous with
          the 4-byte 'bnc-id'\n   parameter used by T1SI, the ATM forum and the ITU
          (Q.1901)\n   standardization effort.  The term 'eecid' stands for 'end-to-end\n
          \  connection identifier', while 'bnc-id' stands for 'backbone network\n
          \  connection identifier'.  The name \"backbone\" is slightly misleading\n
          \  since it refers to the entire ATM network including the ATM edge and\n
          \  ATM core networks.  In Q.1901 terminology, an ATM \"backbone\" connects\n
          \  TDM or analog edges.\n   While the term 'bnc-id' might be used in the
          bearer signaling plane\n   and in an ISUP (Q.1901) call control plane, SDP
          session descriptors\n   use the neutral term 'eecid'.  This provides a common
          SDP baseline\n   for applications that use ISUP (Q.1901) and applications
          that use\n   SIP/SIP+.\n   Section 5.6.6 depicts the use of the eecid in
          call establishment\n   procedures.  In these procedures, the eecid is used
          to correlate\n   service-level calls with SVC set-up requests.\n   In the
          forward SVC establishment model, the call-terminating gateway\n   selects
          an eecid and transmits it via SDP to the call-originating\n   gateway.  The
          call originating gateway transmits this eecid to the\n   call terminating
          gateway via the bearer set-up message (SVC set-up or\n   Q.2630.1 establish
          request).\n   In the backward SVC establishment model, the call-originating
          gateway\n   selects an eecid and transmits it via SDP to the call-terminating\n
          \  gateway.  The call terminating gateway transmits this eecid to the\n
          \  call originating gateway via the bearer set-up message (SVC set-up or\n
          \  Q.2630.1 establish request).\n   The value of the eecid attribute values
          needs to be unique within the\n   node terminating the SVC set-up but not
          across multiple nodes.\n   Hence, the SVC-terminating gateway has complete
          control over using\n   and releasing values of this parameter.  The eecid
          attribute is used\n   to correlate, one-to-one, received bearer set-up requests
          with\n   service-level call control signaling.\n   Within an SDP session
          description, the eecid attribute is used as\n   follows:\n         a=eecid:<eecid>\n
          \  where <eecid> consists of up to 8 hex digits (equivalent to 4\n   octets).
          \ Since this is always represented in hex, the \"0x\" prefix\n   shall not
          be used.\n   Within the text representation of the <eecid> parameter, hex
          digits\n   to the left are more significant than hex digits to the right\n
          \  (Section 2.2).\n   This SDP document does not specify how the eecid (synonymous
          with\n   bnc-id) is to be communicated through bearer signaling (Q.931,
          UNI,\n   PNNI, AINI, IISP, proprietary signaling equivalent, Q.2630.1).
          \ This\n   is a task of these bearer signaling protocols.  However, the\n
          \  following informative statements are made to convey a sense of the\n
          \  interoperability that is a goal of current standardization efforts:\n
          \  -  ITU Q.2941.3 and the ATMF each recommend the use of the GIT IE for\n
          \     carrying the eecid (synonymous with bnc-id) in the set-up message\n
          \     of ATM signaling protocols (Q.2931, UNI 4.0, PNNI, AINI, IISP).\n
          \     The coding for carrying the eecid (bnc-id) in the GIT IE is\n      defined
          in ITU Q.2941.3 and accepted by the ATM forum.\n   -  Another alternate
          method is to use the called party subaddress IE.\n      In some networks,
          this might be considered a protocol violation\n      and is not the recommended
          means of carrying the eecid (bnc-id).\n      The GIT IE is the preferred
          method of transporting the eecid\n      (bnc-id) in ATM signaling messages.\n
          \  -  The establish request (ERQ) message of the Q.2630.1 [37] signaling\n
          \     protocol can use the SUGR (Served User Generated Reference) IE to\n
          \     transport the eecid (bnc-id).\n   The node assigning the eecid can
          release and re-use it when it\n   receives a Q.2931 [15] set-up message
          or a Q.2630.1 [37] establish\n   request message containing the eecid.\n
          \  However, in both cases (backward and forward models), it is\n   recommended
          that this eecid be retained until the connection\n   terminates.  Since
          the eecid space is large enough, it is not\n   necessary to release it as
          soon as possible.\n"

          \ An n x 64\n   clear channel is represented by the encoding names of \"X-CCD\"

          take on integral values\n   in the inclusive range [1...31].  When omitted,
          other means are to be\n   used to determine the subchannel count.\n   Use
          of the 'sbc' attribute provides a direct way to indicate the\n   number

          between P and non-P cells, a value of 46 indicates no\n   padding in P-cells

        - "5.6.3.2 The 'silenceSupp' attribute\n   When present, the 'silenceSupp'
          attribute is used to indicate the use\n   or non-use of silence suppression.
          \ The format of the 'silenceSupp'\n   media attribute line is as follows:\n
          \  a=silenceSupp: <silenceSuppEnable> <silenceTimer> <suppPref> <sidUse>\n
          \                  <fxnslevel>\n   If any of the parameters in the silenceSupp
          media attribute line is\n   not specified, is inapplicable or is implied,
          then it is set to \"-\".\n   The <silenceSuppEnable> can take on values
          of \"on\" or \"off\".  If it\n   is \"on\", then silence suppression is
          enabled.\n   The <silenceTimer> is a 16-bit field which can be represented
          in\n   decimal or hex.  Each increment (tick) of this timer represents a\n
          \  millisecond.  The maximum value of this timer is between 1 and 3\n   minutes.
          \ This timer represents the time-lag before silence\n   suppression kicks
          in.  Even though this can, theoretically, be as low\n   as 1 ms, most DSP
          algorithms take more than that to detect silence.\n   Setting <silenceTimer>
          to a large value (say 1 minute> is equivalent\n   to disabling silence suppression
          within a call.  However, idle\n   channel suppression between calls on the
          basis of silence suppression\n   is still operative in non-switched, trunking
          applications if\n   <silenceSuppEnable> = \"on\" and <silenceTimer> is a
          large value.\n   The <suppPref> specifies the preferred silence suppression
          method\n   that is preferred or already selected.  It can take on the string\n
          \  values of \"standard\" and \"custom\".  If its value is \"standard\",
          then\n   a standard method (e.g., ITU-defined) is preferred to custom methods\n
          \  if such a standard is defined.  Otherwise, a custom method may be\n   used.
          \ If <suppPref> is set to \"custom\", then a custom method, if\n   available,
          is preferred to the standard method.\n   The <sidUse> indicates whether
          SIDs (Silence Insertion Descriptors)\n   are to be used, and whether they
          use fixed comfort noise or sampled\n   background noise.  It can take on
          the string values of \"No SID\",\n   \"Fixed Noise\", \"Sampled Noise\".\n
          \  If the value of <sidUse> is \"Fixed Noise\", then <fxnslevel> provides\n
          \  its level.  It can take on integer values in the range 0-127, as\n   follows:\n

          (rows in the profile tables of ITU I.366.2 or\n   AF-VTOA-0113) are represented
          as four-tuples following the <profile>\n   parameter in the 'profileDesc'
          media attribute line.  If a member of\n   one of these four-tuples is not
          specified or is implied, then it is\n   set to \"-\".\n   The <uuiCodeRange>
          parameter is represented by D1-D2, where D1 and D2\n   are decimal integers
          in the range 0 through 15.\n   The <encodingName> parameter can take one
          of the values in column 2\n   of Table 2.  Additionally, it can take on
          the following descriptor\n   strings: \"PCMG\", \"SIDG\" and \"SID729\".

          \  packet length in octets.\n   The <packetTime> is a decimal integer representation
          of the AAL2\n   packetization interval in microseconds.\n   For instance,
          the 'profileDesc' media attribute line below defines\n   the AAL2/custom
          100 profile.  This profile is reproduced in the Table\n   3 below.  For

          1 5000\n   If the <packetTime> parameter is to be omitted or implied, then
          the\n   same profile can be represented as follows:\n   a=profileDesc:AAL2/custom
          100 0-7 PCMG 40 - 0-7 SIDG 1 - 8-15\n        G726-32 40 - 8-15 SIDG 1 -\n
          \  If a gateway has a provisioned or hard coded definition of a profile,\n

          list of one or more\n   3-tuples.  Each 3-tuple indicates a codec, an optional
          packet length\n   and an optional packetization period.  This complements
          the 'm' line\n   information and should be consistent with it.\n   Within
          each 3-tuple, the <encodingName> parameter can take one of the\n   values
          in column 2 of Table 2.  The <packetLength> is a decimal\n   integer representation
          of the packet length in octets.  The\n   <packetTime> is a decimal integer
          representation of the packetization\n   interval in microseconds.\n   The
          'onewaySel' attribute must not be used in SDP descriptors that\n   have
          one or more of the following attributes: 'vsel', 'dsel', 'fsel'.\n   If
          it is present, then command containing the SDP description may be\n   rejected.

          parameters may\n   not be set to \"-\".  However, the parameters <packetLength>
          and\n   <packetTime> can be set to \"-\" when not needed.\n   For example,\n
          \     a=onewaySel:v f G729 10 10000\n      a=onewaySel:v b G726-32 40 10000\n
          \  indicates that for voice service, the codec to be used in the forward\n
          \  direction is G.729 or G.729a (both are interoperable), and the codec\n
          \  to be used in the backward direction is G726-32.  A packet length of\n
          \  10 octets and a packetization interval of 10 ms are associated with\n
          \  the G.729/G.729a codec.  A packet length of 40 octets and a\n   packetization
          interval of 10 ms are associated with the G726-32\n   codec.\n   For example,\n
          \     a=onewaySel:d f G726-32 20 5000\n      a=onewaySel:d b PCMU 40 5000\n
          \  indicates that for voiceband service (fax not included), the codec to\n
          \  be used in the forward direction is G726-32), and the codec to be\n   used
          in the backward direction is PCMU.  A packet length of 20 octets\n   and
          a packetization interval of 5 ms are associated with the G726-32\n   codec.
          \ A packet length of 40 octets and a packetization interval of\n   5 ms
          are associated with the PCMU codec.\n   This media attribute line can be
          used in ATM as well as non-ATM\n   contexts.  Within the ATM context, it
          can be applied to the AAL1,\n   AAL2 and AAL5 adaptations.  The <packetLength>
          and <packetTime> are\n   not meaningful in the AAL1 case and should be set
          to \"-\".  In the\n   AAL2 case, these lines determine the use of some or
          all of the rows\n   in a given profile table.  If multiple 3-tuples are
          present, they can\n   indicate a hierarchical assignment of some rows in
          that profile to\n   voice service (e.g., row A preferred to row B etc.).
          \ If multiple\n   profiles are present on the 'm' line, the profile qualified
          by this\n   attribute is the first profile.\n   With most of the encoding
          names in Figure 2, the packet length and\n   packetization period can be
          derived from each other.  One of them can\n   be set to \"-\" without a
          loss of information.  There are some\n   exceptions such as the IANA-registered
          encoding names G723, DVI4 and\n   L16 for which this is not true.  Therefore,
          there is a need to retain\n   both the packet length and packetization period

          alternative\n   descriptions of the same session.  In others, these describe\n
          \  different layers of the same connection (e.g., IP, ATM, frame relay).\n
          \  This is useful when these connectivity at these layers are\n   established
          at the same time (e.g., an IP-based session over an ATM\n   SVC).  To distinguish
          between the alternation and concatenation of\n   SDP descriptions, a 'chain'
          attribute can be used in the case of\n   concatenation.\n   When present,
          the 'chain' attribute binds an SDP description to the\n   next or previous
          SDP description.  The next or previous description\n   is separated from
          the current one by a 'v' line.  It is not necessary\n   that this description
          also have a 'chain' media attribute line.\n   Chaining averts the need to
          set up a single SDP description for a\n   session that is simultaneously
          created at multiple layers.  It allows\n   the SDP descriptors for different
          layers to remain simple and clean.\n   Chaining is not needed in the Megaco
          context, where it is possible to\n   create separate terminations for the
          different layers of a\n   connection.\n   The 'chain' media attribute line

          chain attribute from a description since it expressly\n   precludes the
          possibility of chaining.  If the 'chain' attribute is\n   absent in an SDP
          description, chaining can still be realized by the\n   presence of a chain
          media attribute line in the previous or next\n   description.\n"

        the\n        terminating media gateway controller (TMGC) through the\n        appropriate
        mechanism (ISUP with Q.1901 extensions, SIP etc.).\n        Although this
        is not necessary, it can provide the TMGC with the\n        NSAP address provided
        by the OMG.\n   (4)  The TMGC sends the appropriate control message to the
        TMG.  This\n        includes the session descriptor received from the OMG.
        \ This\n        descriptor contains the NSAP address of the OMG.\n   (5)  The
        TMG acknowledges the control message from the TMGC.  Along\n        with the
        acknowledgement, it provides an SDP descriptor with a\n        locally assigned
        eecid.\n   v=0\n   o=- 2873397714 0 ATM NSAP\n      47.0091.8100.0000.0040.2A74.EB03.0020.4421.2A04.00\n

        media gateway controller (TMGC) signals the\n        originating media gateway
        controller (OMGC) through the\n        appropriate mechanism (ISUP with Q.1901
        extensions, SIP etc.).\n        It provides the OMGC with the NSAP address
        and the eecid\n        provided by the TMG.\n   (7)  The OMGC sends the appropriate
        control message to the OMG.  This\n        includes the session descriptor
        received from the TMG.  This\n        descriptor contains the NSAP address
        of the TMG and the EECID\n        assigned by the TMG.  Additionally, the
        OMGC instructs the OMG\n        to set up an SVC to the TMG.  It also requests
        the OMG to notify\n        the OMGC when SVC set-up is complete.  Depending
        on the control\n        protocol used, this can be done through a variety
        of means.  In\n        the Megaco context, the request to set-up an SVC (not
        the\n        notification request for the SVC set-up event) can be made\n
        \       through the following local descriptor:\n   v=0\n   o=- 2873397874
        0 ATM - -\n   s=-\n   c=ATM - -\n   t=0 0\n   m=audio $ - -\n   a=bearerType:SVC
        on\n   The 'bearerType' attribute indicates that an SVC is to be used and\n
        \  that the <localInitiation> flag is on i.e., the SVC is to be set up\n   by
        the TMG.\n   (8)  The OMG acknowledges the control message from the OMGC.\n
        \  (9)  The OMG sends an SVC set-up message to the TMG.  Within the GIT\n
        \       information element, it includes eecid (B3D58E32) received from\n
        \       the TMG.\n   (10) The TMG uses the eecid to correlate the SVC set-up
        request with\n        the service-level control message received before from
        the TMGC.\n   (11) The TMG returns an SVC connect message to the OMG.  On
        receiving\n        this message, the OMG sends an event notification to the
        OMGC\n        indicating successful SVC set-up.\n        Note that, for this
        example,  the \"v=\", \"o=\", \"s=\" and \"t=\"\n        lines can be omitted
        in the Megaco context.\n"

    - "8.1 Bearer Security\n   At present, standard means of encrypting ATM and AAL2
      bearers are not\n   conventionalized in the same manner as means of encrypting
      RTP\n   payloads.  Nor has the authentication of ATM or AAL2 bearer\n   signaling.\n
      \  The SDP encryption key line (k=) defined in RFC 2327 can be used to\n   represent
      the encryption key and the method of obtaining the key.  In\n   the ATM and
      AAL2 contexts, the term 'bearer' can include 'bearer\n   signaling' as well
      as 'bearer payloads'.\n"

    - "8.2 Security of the SDP description\n   The SDP session descriptions might
      originate in untrusted areas such\n   as equipment owned by end-subscribers
      or located at end-subscriber\n   premises.  SDP relies on the security mechanisms
      of the encapsulating\n   protocol or layers below the encapsulating protocol.
      \ Examples of\n   encapsulating protocols are the Session Initiation Protocol
      (SIP),\n   MGCP and Multimedia Gateway Control Protocol (MEGACO).  No additional\n
      \  security mechanisms are needed.  SIP, MGCP and MEGACO can use IPSec\n   authentication
      as described in RFC 1826 [Ref.  27].  IPSec encryption\n   can be optionally
      used with authentication to provide an additional,\n   potentially more expensive
      level of security.  IPSec security\n   associations can be made between equipment
      located in untrusted areas\n   and equipment located in trusted areas through
      configured shared\n   secrets or the use of a certificate authority.\n"
