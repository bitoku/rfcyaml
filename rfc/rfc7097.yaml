  - "1.  Introduction\n   RTP [RFC3550] provides a transport for real-time media flows\
    \ such as\n   audio and video together with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), which\n\
    \   provides periodic feedback about the media streams received in a\n   specific\
    \ duration.  In addition, RTCP can be used for timely feedback\n   about individual\
    \ events to report (e.g., packet loss) [RFC4585].\n   Both long-term and short-term\
    \ feedback enable a media sender to adapt\n   its media transmission and/or encoding\
    \ dynamically to the observed\n   path characteristics.\n   RFC 3611 [RFC3611]\
    \ defines RTCP Extended Reports as a detailed\n   reporting framework to provide\
    \ more than just the coarse Receiver\n   Report (RR) statistics.  The detailed\
    \ reporting may enable a media\n   sender to react more appropriately to the observed\
    \ networking\n   conditions as these can be characterized better, although at\
    \ the\n   expense of extra overhead.\n   Among many other report blocks, RFC 3611\
    \ specifies the Loss Run\n   Length Encoding (RLE) block, which reports runs of\
    \ packets received\n   and lost with the granularity of individual packets.  This\
    \ can help\n   both error recovery and path loss characterization.  In addition\
    \ to\n   lost packets, RFC 3611 defines the notion of \"discarded\" packets:\n\
    \   packets that were received but dropped from the de-jitter buffer\n   because\
    \ they were either too early (for buffering) or too late (for\n   playout).  The\
    \ \"discard rate\" metric is part of the Voice over IP\n   (VoIP) metrics report\
    \ block even though it is not just applicable to\n   audio: it is specified as\
    \ the fraction of discarded packets since the\n   beginning of the session (see\
    \ Section 4.7.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611]).\n   The discard metric is believed to\
    \ be applicable to a large class of\n   RTP applications that use a de-jitter\
    \ buffer [RFC5481].\n   Recently proposed extensions to the Extended Reports (XRs)\
    \ reporting\n   suggest enhancing this discard metric:\n   o  Reporting the number\
    \ of discarded packets in a measurement\n      interval, i.e., either during the\
    \ last reporting interval or since\n      the beginning of the session, as indicated\
    \ by a flag in the\n      suggested XR [RFC7002].  If an endpoint needs to report\
    \ packet\n      discard due to reasons other than early and late arrival (for\n\
    \      example, discard due to duplication, redundancy, etc.), then it\n     \
    \ should consider using the Discarded Packets report block\n      [RFC7002].\n\
    \   o  Reporting gaps and bursts of discarded packets during a\n      measurement\
    \ interval, i.e., the last reporting interval or the\n      duration of the session\
    \ [RFC7003].\n   o  Reporting the sum of payload bytes discarded during a measurement\n\
    \      interval, i.e., the last reporting interval or the duration of the\n  \
    \    session [DISCARD-METRIC].\n   However, none of these metrics allow a receiver\
    \ to report precisely\n   which packets were discarded.  While this information\
    \ could in theory\n   be derived from high-frequency reporting on the number of\
    \ discarded\n   packets [RFC7002] or from the gap/burst report [RFC7003], these\
    \ two\n   mechanisms do not appear feasible: the former would require an unduly\n\
    \   high amount of reporting, which still might not be sufficient due to\n   the\
    \ non-deterministic scheduling of RTCP packets.  The latter incurs\n   significant\
    \ complexity and reporting overhead and might still not\n   deliver the desired\
    \ accuracy.\n   This document defines a discard report block following the idea\
    \ of\n   the run-length encoding applied for lost and received packets in\n  \
    \ [RFC3611].\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP\
    \ 14, RFC 2119\n   [RFC2119].\n   The terminology defined in RTP [RFC3550] and\

    \   The \"chunks\" encoding the run length have the same representation as\n \

  - "4.  Protocol Operation\n   This section describes the behavior of the reporting\
    \ node (= media\n   receiver) and the media sender.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Reporting Node (Receiver)
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Reporting Node (Receiver)\n   Transmission of RTCP XR Discard RLE report\
    \ blocks is up to the\n   discretion of the media receiver, as is the reporting\
    \ granularity.\n   However, it is RECOMMENDED that the media receiver signal all\n\
    \   discarded packets using the method defined in this document.  If all\n   packets\
    \ over a reporting period are discarded, the media receiver MAY\n   use the Discard\
    \ Report Block [RFC7002] instead.  In case of limited\n   available reporting\
    \ bandwidth, it is up to the receiver whether or\n   not to include RTCP XR Discard\
    \ RLE report blocks.\n   The media receiver MAY send the Discard RLE report blocks\
    \ as part of\n   the regularly scheduled RTCP packets, as per RFC 3550.  It MAY\
    \ also\n   include Discard RLE report blocks in immediate or early feedback\n\
    \   packets, as per RFC 4585.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Media Sender
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Media Sender\n   The media sender MUST be prepared to operate without receiving\
    \ any\n   Discard RLE report blocks.  If Discard RLE report blocks are\n   generated\
    \ by the media receiver, the media sender cannot rely on all\n   these reports\
    \ being received, nor can the media sender rely on a\n   regular generation pattern\
    \ from the media receiver.\n   However, if the media sender receives RTCP XR reports\
    \ but the reports\n   contain no Discard RLE report blocks and is aware that the\
    \ media\n   receiver supports Discard RLE report blocks, it MAY assume that no\n\
    \   packets were discarded at the media receiver.\n"
- title: 5.  SDP Signaling
  contents:
  - "5.  SDP Signaling\n   A participant of a media session MAY use SDP to signal\
    \ its support\n   for the report block specified in this document or use them\
    \ without\n   any prior signaling (see Section 5 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611]).\n   For\
    \ signaling in SDP, the RTCP XR attribute as defined in RFC 3611\n   [RFC3611]\
    \ MUST be used.  The SDP [RFC4566] attribute 'xr-format'\n   defined in RFC 3611\
    \ is augmented as described in the following to\n   indicate the discard RLE metric.\n\
    \      rtcp-xr-attrib = \"a=\" \"rtcp-xr\" \":\" [xr-format *(SP xr-format)]\n\
    \                       CRLF   ; defined in [RFC3611]\n      xr-format      =/\
    \ xr-discard-rle\n      xr-discard-rle = \"discard-rle\"\n   The parameter 'discard-rle'\
    \ is used to indicate support for the\n   Discard RLE report block defined in\
    \ Section 3.\n   When SDP is used in Offer/Answer context, the mechanism defined\
    \ in\n   RFC 3611 [RFC3611] for unilateral \"rtcp-xr\" attribute parameters\n\
    \   applies (see Section 5.2 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611]).\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The Discard RLE report block provides per-packet\
    \ statistics so the\n   risk to confidentiality documented in Section 7, Paragraph\
    \ 3, of RFC\n   3611 [RFC3611] applies.  In some situations, returning very detailed\n\
    \   error information (e.g., over-range measurement or measurement\n   unavailable)\
    \ using this report block can provide an attacker with\n   insight into the security\
    \ processing.  Implementers should consider\n   the guidance in [NO-SRTP] for\
    \ using appropriate security mechanisms,\n   i.e., where security is a concern,\
    \ the implementation should apply\n   encryption and authentication to the report\
    \ block.  For example, this\n   can be achieved by using the AVPF profile together\
    \ with the Secure\n   RTP profile as defined in RFC 3711 [RFC3711]; an appropriate\n\
    \   combination of the two profiles (an \"SAVPF\") is specified in RFC 5124\n\
    \   [RFC5124].  However, other mechanisms also exist [SRTP-OPTIONS] and\n   might\
    \ be more suitable.\n   Additionally, The security considerations of RFC 3550\
