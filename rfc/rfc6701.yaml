    \   behavior of all IETF participants with respect to Intellectual\n   Property\
    \ Rights (IPR) about which they might reasonably be aware.\n   The IETF takes\
    \ conformance to these IPR policies very seriously.\n   However, there has been\
    \ some ambiguity as to what the appropriate\n   sanctions are for the violation\
    \ of these policies, and how and by\n   whom those sanctions are to be applied.\n\
    \   This document discusses these issues and provides a suite of\n   potential\
    \ actions that can be taken within the IETF community in\n   cases related to\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF has developed and documented policies that govern\
    \ the\n   behavior of all IETF participants with respect to intellectual\n   property\
    \ about which they might reasonably be aware.  These are\n   documented in RFC\
    \ 3979 [BCP79] and are frequently brought to the\n   attention of IETF participants.\
    \  This document summarizes and\n   references those policies, but does not replace\
    \ or stand in for the\n   full statement of the policies found in [BCP79].  Readers\
    \ and IETF\n   participants need to be aware of the content of [BCP79].\n   The\
    \ policies set out in RFC 3979 [BCP79] state that each individual\n   participant\
    \ is responsible for disclosing or ensuring the disclosure\n   of Intellectual\
    \ Property Rights (IPR) where all of the following\n   apply:\n   -  they are\
    \ aware of the IPR\n   -  the IPR is relevant to the IETF work they are participating\
    \ in\n   -  the IPR is owned by the individual or by a company that employs or\n\
    \      sponsors the individual's work.\n   Conformance to these IPR policies is\
    \ very important, and there is a\n   need to understand both what sanctions can\
    \ be applied to participants\n   who violate the policies, and who is in a position\
    \ to apply the\n   sanctions.\n   This document discusses these issues and provides\
    \ a suite of\n   potential actions that can be taken within the IETF community\
    \ in\n   cases related to patents.  All of these sanctions are currently\n   available\
    \ in IETF processes, and at least two instances of violation\n   of the IPR policy\
    \ have been handled using some of the sanctions\n   listed.  As explicitly called\
    \ out in Section 4, a posting rights (PR)\n   action (described in [BCP25] and\
    \ [RFC3683]) is an applicable sanction\n   for the case of a breach of the IETF's\
    \ IPR policy.\n   Note: This document specifies some administrative sanctions\
    \ that can\n   be imposed by and through IETF administrative processes.  In\n\
    \   particular, this document does not address or limit other legal\n   sanctions,\
    \ rights, or remedies that are available outside of the IETF\n   or any of the\
    \ legal rights or remedies that anyone has regarding IPR.\n   This document does\
    \ not consider the parallel, but important, issue of\n   ways to actively promote\
    \ conformance with the IETF's IPR policy.\n   That topic is discussed in [RFC6702].\n"
- title: 2.  Description of IETF IPR Policy
  contents:
  - "2.  Description of IETF IPR Policy\n   The IETF's IPR policy is set out in [BCP79].\
    \  Nothing in this\n   document defines or redefines the IETF's IPR policy.  This\
    \ section\n   simply highlights some important aspects of those policies.\n  \
    \ Additional information on the IETF's IPR policy may be found at\n   [URLIPR]\
    \ and [URLIESGIPR].\n"
- title: 2.1.  Responsibilities of IETF Participants and Timeliness
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Responsibilities of IETF Participants and Timeliness\n   According to RFC\
    \ 3979 [BCP79], individual IETF participants have a\n   personal responsibility\
    \ to disclose or ensure the timely disclosure\n   of IPR of which they are aware\
    \ and which they own or which is owned\n   by a company that employs or sponsors\
    \ them, and which impinges upon\n   the contribution that they make to the IETF.\n\
    \   A \"contribution\" is also defined in RFC 3979 [BCP79] and includes\n   Internet-Drafts,\
    \ emails to IETF mailing lists, presentations at IETF\n   meetings, and comments\
    \ made at the microphone during IETF meetings.\n   Remote participants as well\
    \ as those participating in person at IETF\n   meetings are bound by this definition.\n\
    \   The timeliness of disclosure is very important within RFC 3979\n   [BCP79].\
    \  No precise definition of \"timeliness\" is given in RFC 3979\n   [BCP79], and\
    \ it is not the purpose of this document to do so.  But it\n   is important to\
    \ understand that the impact that an IPR disclosure has\n   on the smooth working\
    \ of the IETF is directly related to how late in\n   the process the disclosure\
    \ is made.  Thus, a disclosure made on a\n   published RFC is very likely to be\
    \ more disruptive to the IETF than\n   such a disclosure on an early revision\
    \ of an individual submission of\n   an Internet-Draft.\n   Third-party disclosures\
    \ can also be made by anyone who has cause to\n   believe that IPR exists.  Such\
    \ disclosures must be accompanied by the\n   reasons for the disclosures.\n  \
    \ It is important to note that each individual IETF participant has a\n   choice\
    \ under the IETF's IPR policy.  If the individual is unwilling\n   or unable to\
    \ disclose the existence of relevant IPR in a timely\n   manner, that individual\
    \ has the option to refrain from contributing\n   to and participating in IETF\
    \ activities about the technology covered\n   by the IPR.\n"
- title: 2.2.  How Attention Is Drawn to These Responsibilities
  contents:
  - "2.2.  How Attention Is Drawn to These Responsibilities\n   The IETF draws the\
    \ attention of all participants to the IPR policy\n   [BCP79] through the \"Note\
    \ Well\" statement that appears on the IETF\n   web pages [URLNoteWell], in presentations\
    \ at working group and\n   plenary meetings, as well as in the boilerplate text\
    \ appearing in\n   each Internet-Draft and RFC.  Additionally, the Note Well statement\n\
    \   is accepted by any person signing up to join an email list hosted at\n   ietf.org.\n\
    \   [RFC6702] suggests a number of additional ways in which the attention\n  \
    \ of IETF participants can be drawn to the IPR policy.\n"
- title: 2.3.  How IPR Disclosures Are Made
  contents:
  - "2.3.  How IPR Disclosures Are Made\n   The procedure for filing IPR disclosures\
    \ is shown on the IETF's web\n   site at [URLDisclose].  Third-party disclosures\
    \ can also be made by\n   email to the IETF Secretariat or via the web page.\n\
    \   Note that early disclosures or warnings that there might be IPR on a\n   technology\
    \ can also be made.\n"
- title: 2.4.  How Working Groups Consider IPR Disclosures
  contents:
  - "2.4.  How Working Groups Consider IPR Disclosures\n   In the normal course of\
    \ events, a working group that is notified of\n   the existence of IPR must make\
    \ a decision about whether to continue\n   with the work as it is, or whether\
    \ to revise the work to attempt to\n   avoid the IPR claim.  This decision is\
    \ made on the working group's\n   mailing list using normal rough consensus procedures.\
    \  However,\n   discussions of the applicability of an IPR claim or of the\n \
    \  appropriateness or merit of the IPR licensing terms are outside the\n   scope\
    \ of the WG.  The IPR situation is considered by working group\n   participants\
    \ as the document advances through the development process\n   [RFC2026], in particular\
    \ at key times such as adoption of the\n   document by the working group and during\
    \ last call.\n   It needs to be clearly understood that the way that the working\
    \ group\n   handles an IPR disclosure is distinct from the sanctions that can\
    \ be\n   applied to the individuals who violated the IETF's IPR policy.  That\n\
    \   is, the decision by a working group to, for example, entirely re-work\n  \
    \ an Internet-Draft in order to avoid a piece of IPR that has been\n   disclosed\
    \ should not be seen as a sanction against the authors.\n   Indeed, and especially\
    \ in the case of a late IPR disclosure, that a\n   working group decides to do\
    \ this can be considered a harmful side\n   effect on the working group (in that\
    \ it slows down the publication of\n   an RFC and might derail other work the\
    \ working group could be doing)\n   and should be considered as one of the reasons\
    \ to apply sanctions to\n   the individuals concerned as described in the next\
    \ two sections.\n"
- title: 2.5.  The Desire for Sanctions
  contents:
  - "2.5.  The Desire for Sanctions\n   Not conforming to the IETF's IPR policy undermines\
    \ the work of the\n   IETF, and sanctions ought to be applied against offenders.\n"
- title: 2.6.  Severity of Violations
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Severity of Violations\n   Clearly there are different sorts of violations\
    \ of IPR policy.\n   Sometimes, a working group participant simply does not realize\
    \ that\n   the IPR that they invented applies to a particular working group\n\
    \   draft.  Sanctions (if any) need not be at all severe.  However, a\n   working\
    \ group document editor who waits until near the publication of\n   a document\
    \ to reveal IPR of which they themselves are the author\n   should be subject\
    \ to more serious sanctions.  These are judgments\n   that can be made by the\
    \ working group chairs and area director.\n   This topic forms the bulk of the\
    \ material in Sections 5 and 6.\n"
- title: 3.  Who Initiates Sanctions
  contents:
  - "3.  Who Initiates Sanctions\n   Any IETF participant can draw attention to an\
    \ apparent violation of\n   the IETF's IPR policy.  This can be done by sending\
    \ email with a\n   short summary of the relevant facts and events to the appropriate\n\
    \   IETF mailing list.  Normally, the working group chairs and area\n   directors\
    \ assume the responsibility for ensuring the smooth running\n   of the IETF and\
    \ for the enforcement of IETF policies including the\n   IPR policy.  Thus, when\
    \ sanctions are appropriate, working group\n   chairs will be the first actors\
    \ when there is an active working group\n   involved in the technical work, and\
    \ area directors will be the first\n   actors in other cases.  The first step\
    \ will usually be the working\n   group chairs or area director to gather the\
    \ facts and discuss the\n   matter with the IETF participants involved.\n   Working\
    \ group chairs are already empowered to take action against\n   working group\
    \ participants who flout the IPR rules and so disrupt the\n   smooth running of\
    \ the IETF or a specific working group, just as they\n   can take such action\
    \ in the face of other disruptions.\n   The working group chairs have the responsibility\
    \ to select the\n   appropriate actions since they are closest to the details\
    \ of the\n   issue.  Where there is no working group involved or where making\
    \ the\n   decision or applying the sanctions is uncomfortable or difficult for\n\
    \   the working group chairs, the responsible AD is available to guide or\n  \
    \ direct the action if necessary.\n"
- title: 4.  Available Sanctions
  contents:
  - "4.  Available Sanctions\n   This section lists some of the sanctions available\
    \ to handle the case\n   of an individual who violates the IETF's IPR policies.\
    \  It is not\n   intended to be an exhaustive list, nor is it suggested that only\
    \ one\n   sanction be applied in any case.  Furthermore, it is not suggested\n\
    \   here that every case of IPR policy infringement is the same or that\n   the\
    \ severest sanctions may be applied in each case.\n   In many cases, it may be\
    \ appropriate to notify a wider IETF community\n   of the violation and sanctions\
    \ so that patterns of behavior can be\n   spotted and handled.\n   The sanctions\
    \ are listed in approximate order of severity, but the\n   ordering should not\
    \ be taken as definitive or as driving different\n   decisions in different cases.\
    \  Section 5 provides some notes on\n   fairness, while Section 6 gives some guidance\
    \ on selecting an\n   appropriate sanction in any specific case.\n   a. A private\
    \ discussion between the working group chair or area\n      director and the individual\
    \ to understand what went wrong and how\n      it can be prevented in the future.\n\
    \   b. A formal, but private, warning that the individuals must improve\n    \
    \  their behavior or risk one of the other sanctions.\n   c. A formal warning\
    \ on an IETF mailing list that the individuals must\n      improve their behavior\
    \ or risk one of the other sanctions.\n   d. Announcement to the working group\
    \ of the failure by the\n      individuals (\"name and shame\").\n   e. On-going\
    \ refusal to accept the individuals as editors of any new\n      working group\
    \ documents.  The appointment of editors of working\n      group documents is\
    \ entirely at the discretion of the working group\n      chairs acting for the\
    \ working group as explained in RFC 2418\n      [BCP25].\n   f. Removal of the\
    \ individuals as working group document editors on\n      specific documents or\
    \ across the whole working group.\n   g. Re-positioning of the individuals' attribution\
    \ in a document to\n      the \"Acknowledgements\" section with or without a note\
    \ explaining\n      why they are listed there and not in the \"Authors' Addresses\"\
    \n      section (viz. the IPR policy violation).  This action can also be\n  \
    \    recorded by the area director in the Datatracker entries for the\n      documents\
    \ concerned.\n   h. Deprecation or rejection of the individual document (whether\
    \ it be\n      an RFC or Internet-Draft) or cessation of work on the affected\n\
    \      technology.\n   i. Application of a temporary suspension of indiviuals'\
    \ posting\n      rights to a specific mailing list according to the guidelines\n\
    \      expressed in [BCP25].  Such bans are applied to specific\n      individuals\
    \ and to individual working group mailing lists at the\n      discretion of the\
    \ working group chairs for a period of no more\n      than 30 days.\n   j. The\
    \ removal of individuals' posting privileges using a Posting\n      Rights Action\
    \ (PR Action) as per [RFC3683].  This is a more\n      drastic measure that can\
    \ be applied when other sanctions are\n      considered insufficient or to have\
    \ been ineffective.  When a PR\n      action is in place, the subjects have their\
    \ posting rights to a\n      particular IETF mailing list removed for a period\
    \ of a year\n      (unless the action is revoked or extended), and maintainers\
    \ of any\n      IETF mailing list may, at their discretion and without further\n\
    \      recourse to explanation or discussion, also remove posting rights.\n  \
    \    PR actions are introduced by an area director and are considered\n      by\
    \ the IETF community and the IESG in order to determine IETF\n      consensus.\n\
    \   Note that individuals who have supplied text that is included in an\n   IETF\
    \ document (RFC or Internet-Draft) have a right to be recognized\n   for their\
    \ contribution.  This means that authors' names cannot be\n   entirely removed\
    \ from a document in the event that they violate the\n   IETF's IPR policy unless\
    \ the text they contributed is also completely\n   removed.  But an individual's\
    \ name can be removed from the front page\n   and even moved from the \"Authors'\
    \ Addresses\" section so long as\n   proper acknowledgement of the contribution\
    \ is given in the\n   \"Acknowledgements\" section.\n"
- title: 4.1.  An Additional Note on the Applicability of PR Actions
  contents:
  - "4.1.  An Additional Note on the Applicability of PR Actions\n   The applicability\
    \ of PR actions in the event of IPR policy possibly\n   needs some explanation.\
    \  According to [RFC3683], a PR action may be\n   considered as a practice for\
    \ use by the IETF in the case that \"a\n   participant has engaged in a 'denial-of-service'\
    \ attack to disrupt\n   the consensus-driven process\".\n   [RFC3683] further\
    \ cites RFC 2418 [BCP25] and [RFC3005] for guidelines\n   for dealing with abusive\
    \ behavior.  RFC 2418 is updated by RFC 3934\n   in this matter (see [BCP25]).\n\
    \   In some cases, ignoring or flouting the IETF's IPR policy may be\n   considered\
    \ as disruptive to the smooth operation of a working group\n   or of the whole\
    \ IETF such that the offender might be deemed to be a\n   disruptive individual\
    \ under the terms of [BCP25] and [RFC3683], and\n   so is liable to be the subject\
    \ of a sanction that restricts their\n   rights to post to IETF mailing lists\
    \ as described in bullets h and i\n   of Section 4 of this document.\n"

    \ appeal the decision.  The\n   IETF's appeals procedures are described in Section\
    \ 6.5 of [RFC2026]\n   and reinforced in the IESG statement at [URLIESG2026].\

    \  The judgment needs to\n   be applied equitably should similar situations arise\
    \ in the future.\n   If in any doubt, the person selecting and applying the sanctions\n\
    \   should seek the opinion of the relevant part of the IETF community or\n  \
    \ the community as a whole.  Furthermore, the person should not\n   hesitate to\
    \ seek the advice of their colleagues (co-chairs, area\n   directors, or the whole\

    \ and\n   so may be regarded as an attack on the correct operation of the IETF.\n\

  - "Appendix A.  Guidance on Selecting and Applying Sanctions\n   As discussed in\
    \ Section 6, the selection of sanctions needs to be a\n   carefully made judgment\
    \ call that considers all relevant\n   circumstances and events.  This Appendix\
    \ provides a list of questions\n   that might form part of that judgment.\n  \
    \ This list of considerations is for guidance and is not prescriptive\n   or exhaustive,\
    \ and it does not imply any weighting of the\n   considerations.\n   -  How long\
    \ has the participant been active in the IETF?\n   -  Is there some exceptional\
    \ circumstance?\n   -  Are there special circumstances that imply that the individual\n\
    \      would not have seen or understood the pointers to and content of\n    \
    \  [BCP79]?\n   -  How late is the disclosure?  Is the document already a working\n\
    \      group document?  How many revisions have been published?  How much\n  \
    \    time has elapsed?  Have last calls been held?  Has the work been\n      published\
    \ as an RFC?\n   -  Is the individual a minor contributor to the IETF work, or\
    \ is the\n      individual clearly a major contributor?\n   -  Is there a reason\
    \ for the individual forgetting the existence of\n      the IPR (for example,\
    \ it was filed many years previous to the work\n      in the IETF)?\n   -  Was\
    \ the individual told by their company that disclosure was\n      imminent, but\
    \ then something different happened?\n   -  How speedy and humble was the individual's\
    \ apology?\n   -  How disruptive to the IETF work are the disclosure and the\n\
    \      associated license terms?  A factor in this will be whether or not\n  \
    \    the IETF community sees the need to re-work the document.\n   -  Does the\
    \ large number of patents that the individual has invented\n      provide any\
    \ level of excuse for failing to notice that one of\n      their patents covered\
    \ the IETF work?\n"
