Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Proxy Mobile IPv6 Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, the Proxy Mobile IPv6 MIB can be used to monitor and control the mobile access gateway (MAG) and the local mobility anchor (LMA) functions of a Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) entity.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The Proxy Mobile IPv6 Protocol Entities
[RFC5213] is an extension to the Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) protocol that facilitates network based localized mobility management (NETLMM) for IPv6 nodes in a PMIPv6 domain.
There are three types of entities envisaged by the PMIPv6 protocol.
mobile node (MN): In the PMIPv6 context, this term is used to refer to an IP host or router whose mobility is managed by the network.
Local Mobility Anchor is the home agent for the mobile node in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.
It is the topological anchor point for the mobile node's home network prefix(es) and is the entity that manages the mobile node's binding state.
The local mobility anchor has the functional capabilities of a home agent as defined in the Mobile IPv6 base specification [RFC6275] with the additional capabilities required for supporting the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol as defined in the PMIPv6 specification [RFC5213].
Mobile Access Gateway is the entity on an access router that manages the mobility related signaling for a mobile node that is attached to its access link.
It is responsible for tracking the mobile node's movements to and from the access link and for signaling the mobile node's local mobility anchor.
This document defines a set of managed objects (MOs) that can be used to monitor and control PMIPv6 entities.
The terminology used in this document is consistent with the definitions used in the Mobile IPv6 protocol specification [RFC6275] and in the NETLMM goals document [RFC4831].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
Proxy Mobile IPv6 Monitoring and Control Requirements
For managing a PMIPv6 entity, it is necessary to monitor the following:  capabilities of PMIPv6 entities  signaling traffic due to PMIPv6 signaling  binding related details (at LMA and MAG)
binding related statistics (at LMA and MAG) 4.
The basic principle has been to keep the MIB as simple as possible and, at the same time, to make it effective enough so that the essential needs of monitoring and control are met.
The Proxy Mobile IPv6 Management Information Base (PMIPV6 MIB) extends the Mobile IPv6 Management Information Base (MIPV6 MIB)
It is assumed that PMIPV6 MIB will always be implemented in conjunction with the MOBILEIPV6 MIB [RFC4295].
The PMIPV6 MIB uses the textual conventions defined in the INET ADDRESS MIB [RFC4001] and IP MIB [RFC4293].
The PMIPV6 MIB is composed of the following groups of definitions: pmip6Core: a generic group containing objects that are common to all the Proxy Mobile IPv6 entities.
Objects belonging to this group will be implemented on the corresponding Proxy Mobile IPv6 entity.
pmip6BindingCacheTable belongs to this group.
this group models the mobile access gateway service.
Objects belonging to this group have the "pmip6Mag" prefix and will be implemented on the corresponding MAG.
pmip6Lma: this group models the local mobility anchor service.
Objects belonging to this group have the "pmip6Lma" prefix and will be implemented on the corresponding LMA.
pmip6Notifications: defines the set of notifications that will be used to asynchronously monitor the Proxy Mobile IPv6 entities.
The tables contained in the above groups are as follows: pmip6BindingCacheTable: models the Binding Cache on the local mobility anchor.
pmip6MagProxyCOATable: models the Proxy Care of Addresses configured on the egress interfaces of the mobile access gateway.
pmip6MagMnIdentifierTable: provides a mapping from the MAG  internal pmip6MagMnIndex to the mobile node identifier.
pmip6MagMnLLIdentifierTable: provides a mapping from the MAG  internal pmip6MagMnLLIndex to the corresponding interface of the mobile node link layer identifier.
pmip6MagHomeNetworkPrefixTable: contains the home network prefixes assigned to interfaces of all mobile nodes attached to the MAG.
Each interface is distinguished by the attached mobile node identifier (MN Identifier) and the link layer identifier (MN LL Identifier).
pmip6MagBLTable: models the Binding Update List (BL) that includes PMIPv6 related information and is maintained by the mobile access gateway.
: contains the mobile node's policy profile that includes the essential operational parameters that are required by the network entities for managing the mobile node's mobility service.
pmip6LmaLMAATable: contains the LMA Addresses (LMAAs) that are configured on the local mobility anchor.
Each LMA Address acts as a transport endpoint of the tunnel between the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway.
pmip6LmaMnIdentifierTable: provides a mapping from the LMA  internal pmip6BindingMnIndex to the mobile node identifier.
pmip6LmaMnLLIdentifierTable: provides a mapping from the LMA  internal pmip6BindingMnLLIndex to the corresponding interface of the mobile node link layer identifier.
pmip6LmaHomeNetworkPrefixTable: contains the list of home network prefixes assigned to the connected interfaces of the mobile nodes anchored on an LMA.
A Proxy Mobile IPv6 Textual Conventions MIB module containing Textual Conventions to represent commonly used Proxy Mobile IPv6 management information is defined.
The intent is that these TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs) will be imported and used in PMIPv6 related MIB modules that would otherwise define their own representation(s).
This MIB module includes references to RFC 4283 [RFC4283] and RFC 5213 [RFC5213].

"This variable specifies the length of time in milliseconds
the local mobility anchor MUST wait before it deletes a Binding Cache entry of a mobile node, upon receiving a Proxy Binding Update message from a mobile access gateway with a lifetime value of 0.
During this wait time, if the local mobility anchor receives a Proxy Binding Update for the same mobility binding, with a lifetime value greater than 0, then it must update the Binding Cache entry with the accepted binding values.
By the end of this wait time, if the local mobility anchor did not receive any valid Proxy Binding Update message for that mobility binding, it MUST delete the Binding Cache entry.
This delay essentially ensures that a mobile node's Binding Cache entry is not deleted too quickly and allows some time for the new mobile access gateway to complete the signaling for the mobile node.
The default value for this variable is 10000 milliseconds.
"This variable specifies the length of time in milliseconds
the local mobility anchor MUST wait for the de registration message for an existing mobility session before it decides to create a new mobility session.
The default value for this variable is 1500 milliseconds.
Note that there is a dependency between this value and the values used in the retransmission algorithm for Proxy Binding Updates.
The retransmissions need to happen before MaxDelayBeforeNewBCEAssign runs out, as otherwise there are situations where a de registration from a previous mobile access gateway may be lost, and the local mobility anchor creates, needlessly, a new mobility session and new prefixes for the mobile node.
However, this affects situations where there is no information from the lower layers about the type of a handoff or other parameters that can be used for identifying the mobility session. "
"This variable specifies the maximum length of time difference in milliseconds between the timestamp in the received Proxy Binding Update message and the current time of day on the local mobility anchor that is allowed by the local mobility anchor for the received message to be considered valid.

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and the corresponding sensitivity/vulnerability: The value of the following objects is used to enable or disable the PMIPv6 functionality on the corresponding PMIPv6 entity.
Access to these MOs may be abused to disrupt the communication that depends on the PMIPv6 functionality.
pmip6MagStatus pmip6LmaStatus Access to the following MOs may be abused to misconfigure PMIPv6 entities and disrupt communications.

Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: The following address related objects may be considered to be particularly sensitive and/or private.
The following MN Identifier related MOs may be used to identify users.
These may be considered to be sensitive and/or private.
pmip6MagMnLLIdentifier pmip6LmaMnIdentifier pmip6LmaMnLLIdentifier pmip6MagProfMnIdentifier SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Implementations MUST provide the security features described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), including full support for authentication and privacy via the User based Security Model (USM)
[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
