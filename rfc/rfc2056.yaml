- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Z39.50 is an information retrieval protocol that does not\
    \ fit neatly\n   into a retrieval model designed primarily around the stateless\
    \ fetch\n   of data.  Instead, it models a general user inquiry as a session-\n\
    \   oriented, multi-step task, any step of which may be suspended\n   temporarily\
    \ while the server requests additional parameters from the\n   client before continuing.\
    \  Some, none, or all of these client/server\n   interactions may require participation\
    \ of the client user, depending\n   only on the client software (the protocol\
    \ itself makes no such\n   requirements).\n   On the other hand, retrieval of\
    \ \"well-known\" data may be performed in\n   a single step, that is, with a degenerate\
    \ Z39.50 session consisting\n   of exactly one protocol search request and response.\
    \  Besides the\n   basic search sub-service, there are several ancillary sub-services\n\
    \   (e.g., Scan, Result Set Delete).  Among the functions covered by\n   combinations\
    \ of the sub-services, two core functions emerge as\n   appropriately handled\
    \ by two separate URL schemes:  the Session URL\n   and the Retrieval URL.\n \
    \  Using two schemes instead of one makes a critical distinction between\n   a\
    \ Z39.50 Session URL, which opens a client session initialized for\n   interactive\
    \ use by the user, and a Z39.50 Retrieval URL, which opens\n   and closes a client\
    \ session to retrieve a specific information item.\n   Making this distinction\
    \ at the scheme level allows the user interface\n   to reflect it on to the user,\
    \ without requiring the user interface to\n   parse otherwise opaque parts of\
    \ the URL (consistent with current\n   practice).\n"
- title: 2. Some Basic Concepts
  contents:
  - "2. Some Basic Concepts\n   This section briefly describes the usage of Z39.50-specific\n\
    \   terminology within the URL definitions below: specifically, the terms\n  \
    \ database, elementset, recordsyntax, and docid.\n   The Z39.50 protocol specifies\
    \ various information retrieval\n   operations, the two most basic of which are\
    \ Search and Present. In a\n   Search operation a client provides search criteria\
    \ and indicates a\n   database (or several databases) on the server to search.\
    \  The\n   essential result of a Search operation is that a result set is\n  \
    \ created at the server, consisting of pointers to the selected\n   database records.\n\
    \   Z39.50 models database records, abstract database records, and\n   retrieval\
    \ records.  A database record is a unit of information in a\n   database, represented\
    \ in a data structure local to the server.  An\n   abstract database record is\
    \ an abstract representation of that\n   information, where the client and server\
    \ share a common understanding\n   of the representation.  This allows logical\
    \ elements to be addressed\n   and selected for transfer, via an element set specification,\
    \ or, as\n   used below, an \"elementset\".  A retrieval record is the set of\n\
    \   selected elements packaged in an exportable structure, by the\n   application\
    \ of a \"recordsyntax\".\n   Thus a Search operation results in entries pointing\
    \ to database\n   records; via a Present operation, a client requests a retrieval\n\
    \   record, corresponding to a database record, corresponding to an entry\n  \
    \ in the result set. The client indicates the composition and format of\n   the\
    \ retrieval record by specifying an elementset and recordsyntax,\n   respectively.\n\
    \   A special case of a Z39.50 search is a \"known-item\" search, when a\n   client\
    \ intends that a search identify a single, known database\n   record, or \"document\"\
    \ (for purposes of illustration, assume that a\n   database record corresponds\
    \ to a document), and further, the client\n   knows an identifier for the document\
    \ that can be used to effect this\n   known-item search.  In this case, this identifier\
    \ is often referred\n   to as a document identifier, or \"docid\".\n"
- title: 3. The Z39.50 Session URL
  contents:
  - "3. The Z39.50 Session URL\n   The Z39.50 Session URL may be informally described\
    \ as providing the\n   mechanism to switch the user to a Z39.50 client application.\n\
    \   -  Host is required.\n   -  Port is optional, and defaults to 210.\n   - \
    \ All other parameters are optional.\n   -  The Z39.50 client will start a session\
    \ to the specified host/port\n      (alternatively, it need not explicitly start\
    \ a session, but may\n      instead utilize an already open session to the same\
    \ host/port).\n   -  A database must be included if docid is included.\n   - \
    \ If docid is included, the client will perform the specified search\n      (in\
    \ the same manner as for the retrieval URL, specified below).\n   -  If docid\
    \ is not included, and other parameters (besides host/port)\n      are specified,\
    \ the client may use those parameters as \"hints\".\n      Various clients may\
    \ choose to treat them as requirements, or as\n      preferences, or ignore them.\n\
    \   -  In any case (whether a search is performed or not), the client\n      will\
    \ leave the Z39.50 session open for the user, to do\n      retrievals, new searches,\
    \ etc.  (This is the main distinction\n      from the Retrieval URL which leaves\
    \ it up to the client whether\n      or not to keep the Z39.50 session open.)\n"
- title: 4. The Z39.50 Retrieval URL
  contents:
  - "4. The Z39.50 Retrieval URL\n   The Z39.50 Retrieval URL is intended to allow\
    \ a Z39.50 session to be\n   used as a transparent transfer mechanism to retrieve\
    \ a specific\n   information object.  A Z39.50 client uses information in the\
    \ URL to\n   formulate a Search Request.  The server's Search Response indicates\n\
    \   how many records match the Request.  If the number of matching\n   records\
    \ does not equal one, the retrieval is considered unsuccessful,\n   and the client\
    \ application's behavior is not defined.  If the number\n   of matching records\
    \ equals one, the server may have included the\n   desired record in the Search\
    \ Response.  If not, the client requests\n   transmission of the record with a\
    \ Present Request.  After the client\n   has received the specified record it\
    \ may close the Z39.50 session\n   immediately, or keep it open for subsequent\
    \ retrievals.\n   -  Host is required.\n   -  Port is optional, and defaults to\
    \ 210.\n   -  A database is required.\n   -  The meaning of a retrieval URL with\
    \ no docid is undefined.\n   -  The docid is placed into a type-1 query, as the\
    \ single term, in\n      the general format (tag 45), using the Bib-1 attribute\
    \ set, with\n      a Use attribute value of docid, and a structure attribute of\
    \ URx.\n      The docid string is server-defined and completely opaque to the\n\
    \      client.\n   - If element set name (esn) is not specified, it is the client's\n\
    \      choice.  If esn is specified, it should be used either in the\n      Search\
    \ request for the value of small- and/or medium-\n      set-element-set-names\
    \ or in a Present request following a\n      Search.  These terms and their use\
    \ are defined within the Z39.50\n      Standard [2].\n   -  If record syntax (rs)\
    \ is not specified, it is the client's choice.\n      If one or more record syntaxes\
    \ are specified, the client should\n      select one (preferably the first in\
    \ the list that it supports)\n      and use it in a Search or Present request\
    \ as the value of\n      PreferredRecordSyntax.\n"

    \   apply.  This means, for example, that a locator might no longer point\n  \
    \ to the object that was originally intended.  It also means that it\n   may be\
    \ possible to construct a URL so that an attempt to perform a\n   harmless idempotent\

    \ damaging remote operation to occur.\n"
