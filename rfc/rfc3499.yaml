    \ to be\nrepresented using only the ASCII characters already allowed in so-called\n\
    host names today.  This backward-compatible representation is required\nin existing\
    \ protocols like DNS, so that IDNs can be introduced with no\nchanges to the existing\

    \ the restart of its Label\nDistribution Protocol (LDP) component, on LSRs that\
    \ are capable of\npreserving the MPLS forwarding component across the restart.\n\
    The mechanism described in this document is applicable to all LSRs, both\nthose\
    \ with the ability to preserve forwarding state during LDP restart\nand those\
    \ without (although the latter needs to implement only a subset\nof the mechanism\
    \ described in this document).  Supporting (a subset of)\nthe mechanism described\
    \ here by the LSRs that can not preserve their\nMPLS forwarding state across the\
    \ restart would not reduce the negative\nimpact on MPLS traffic caused by their\
    \ control plane restart, but it\nwould minimize the impact if their neighbor(s)\
    \ are capable of preserving\nthe forwarding state across the restart of their\
    \ control plane and\nimplement the mechanism described here.\nThe mechanism makes\
    \ minimalistic assumptions on what has to be preserved\nacross restart - the mechanism\
    \ assumes that only the actual MPLS\nforwarding state has to be preserved; the\
    \ mechanism does not require any\nof the LDP-related states to be preserved across\
    \ the restart.\nThe procedures described in this document apply to downstream\n\

    By knowing what parts of a message the sender deems critical, a content\ngateway\

    \  In addition, critical\ncontent can help the gateway chose the notification\

    \ used for the upstream bottleneck\nlink carrying the ACKs, typically using header\

    \                         Messaging\nInstant Messaging (IM) refers to the transfer\

    \ not required to be,\nshort.  IMs are often used in a conversational mode, that\
    \ is, the\ntransfer of messages back and forth is fast enough for participants\
    \ to\nmaintain an interactive conversation.\nThis document proposes the MESSAGE\
    \ method, an extension to the Session\nInitiation Protocol (SIP) that allows the\
    \ transfer of Instant Messages.\nSince the MESSAGE request is an extension to\
    \ SIP, it inherits all the\nrequest routing and security features of that protocol.\
    \  MESSAGE\nrequests carry the content in the form of MIME body parts.  MESSAGE\n\
    requests do not themselves initiate a SIP dialog; under normal usage\neach Instant\
    \ Message stands alone, much like pager messages.  MESSAGE\nrequests may be sent\
    \ in the context of a dialog initiated by some other\nSIP request.  [STANDARDS\
