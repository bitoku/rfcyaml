This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing subnetworks which use the IEEE 802.5 Token Ring technology described in 802.5 Token Ring Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications, IEEE Standard 802.5 1989 [7].
This memo is a replacement for RFC 1231.
The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
Network Management Framework consists of four major components.
[2] defines MIB II, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
[3] which defines the administrative and other architectural aspects of the framework.
RFC 1448 [4] which defines the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Object Definitions Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.
This memo defines three tables: the 802.5 Interface Table, which contains state and parameter information which is specific to 802.5 interfaces, the 802.5 Statistics Table, which contains 802.5 interface statistics, and the 802.5 Timer Table, which contains the values of 802.5 defined timers.
A managed system will have one entry in the 802.5 Interface Table and one entry in the 802.5 Statistics Table for each of its 802.5 interfaces.
The 802.5 Timer Table is obsolete, but its definition has been retained in this memo for backward compatibility.
This memo also defines OBJECT IDENTIFIERs, some to identify interface tests for use with the ifTestTable [6], and some to identify Token Ring interface Chip Sets.
All representations of MAC addresses in this MIB Module use the MacAddress textual convention [5] for which the address is in the "canonical" order defined by IEEE 802.1a, i.e., as if it were transmitted least significant bit first, even though 802.5 requires MAC addresses to be transmitted most significant bit first.
16 bit addresses, if needed, are represented by setting their upper 4 octets to all zeros, i.e., AAFF would be represented as 00000000AAFF.
Relationship to RFC 1213 When this MIB module is used in conjunction with the "old" (i.e., pre RFC 1573) interfaces group, the relationship between an 802.5 interface and an interface in the context of the RFC 1213 is one  to one.
That is, the value of an ifIndex object instance for an 802.5 interface can be directly used to identify corresponding instances of the objects defined in this memo.
3.3.  Relationship to RFC 1573 RFC 1573, the Interface MIB Evolution, requires that any MIB module which is an adjunct of the Interface MIB, clarify specific areas within the Interface MIB.
These areas were intentionally left vague in RFC 1573 to avoid over constraining the MIB module, thereby precluding management of certain media types.
Section 3.3 of RFC 1573 enumerates several areas which a media  specific MIB module must clarify.
Each of these areas is addressed in a following subsection.
The implementor is referred to RFC 1573 in order to understand the general intent of these areas.
Layering Model For the typical usage of this IEEE 802.5 MIB module, there will be no sub layers "above" or "below" the 802.5 interface.
However, this MIB module does not preclude such layering.
Virtual Circuits 802.5 does not support virtual circuits.
This MIB module defines two tests for 802.5 interfaces:
Implementation of these tests is not required.
The ifRcvAddressTable is defined to contains all MAC addresses, unicast, multicast (group) and broadcast, for which an interface will receive packets.
For 802.5 interfaces, its use includes functional addresses.
The format of the address, contained in ifRcvAddressAddress, is the same as for ifPhysAddress.
For functional addresses on a particular 802.5 interface, only one ifRcvAddressTable entry is required.
That entry is the one for the address which has the functional address bit
with the bit mask of all functional addresses for which the interface will accept frames.
For an 802.5 interface, ifPhysAddress contains the interface's IEEE MAC address, stored as an octet string of length 6, in IEEE 802.1a "canonical" order, i.e., the Group Bit is positioned as the low order bit (0x01) of the first octet.
The objects defined in this memo apply to each interface for which the ifType has the value: iso88025 tokenRing(9) 4.

1 408 526 5260 EMail: kzm@cisco.com" DESCRIPTION "
The MIB module for IEEE Token Ring entities."
This table contains state and parameter information which   is specific to 802.5 interfaces.
It is mandatory that   systems having 802.5 interfaces implement this table in   addition to the ifTable (see RFCs 1213 and 1573).
SEQUENCE OF Dot5Entry MAX ACCESS
"This table contains Token Ring interface parameters and state variables, one entry per 802.5 interface."
A list of Token Ring status and parameter values for an 802.5 interface.
"The value of this object identifies the 802.5 interface for which this entry contains management information.
The value of this object for a particular interface has the same value as the ifIndex object, defined in MIB II for the same interface."
INTEGER { noop(1), open(2), reset(3), close(4) } MAX ACCESS
When this object is set to the value of open(2), the station should go into the open state.
The progress and success of the open is given by the values of the objects dot5RingState and dot5RingOpenStatus.
When this object is set to the value of reset(3), then the station should do a reset.
On a reset, all MIB counters should retain their values, if possible.
Other side affects are dependent on the hardware chip set.
When this object is set to the value of close(4), the station should go into the stopped state by removing itself from the ring.
Setting this object to a value of noop(1) has no effect.
When read, this object always has a value of noop(1).
The open(2) and close(4) values correspond to the up(1) and down(2)
values of MIB II's ifAdminStatus and ifOperStatus, i.e., the setting of ifAdminStatus and dot5Commands affects the values of both dot5Commands and ifOperStatus."
Before an open is completed, this object has the value for the 'no status' condition.
The dot5RingState and dot5RingOpenStatus objects provide for debugging problems when the station can not even enter the ring.
The object's value is a sum of values, one for each currently applicable condition.
The following values are defined for various conditions: 0
No Problems detected 32   Ring Recovery 64
reserved 1024   Auto Removal Error 2048
no status, open not completed."
The current interface state with respect to entering or leaving the ring."
"This object indicates the success, or the reason for failure, of the station's most recent attempt to enter the ring."
, fourMegabit(3), sixteenMegabit(4) } MAX ACCESS
The ring speed at the next insertion into the ring.
Note that this may or may not be different to the current ring speed which is given by MIB II's ifSpeed.
For interfaces which do not support changing ring speed, dot5RingSpeed can only be set to its current value.
When dot5RingSpeed has the value unknown(1), the ring's actual ring speed is to be used."
The MAC address of the up stream neighbor station in the ring."
"If this object has a value of true(1) then this interface will participate in the active monitor selection process.
If the value is false(2) then it will not.
Setting this object does not take effect until the next Active Monitor election, and might not take effect until the next time the interface is opened."
The bit mask of all Token Ring functional addresses for which this interface will accept frames."
It is mandatory that systems   having 802.5 interfaces implement this table.
SEQUENCE OF Dot5StatsEntry MAX ACCESS
A table containing Token Ring statistics, one entry per 802.5 interface.
All the statistics are defined using the syntax Counter32 as 32 bit wrap around counters.
Thus, if an interface's hardware maintains these statistics in 16 bit counters, then the agent must read the hardware's counters frequently enough to prevent loss of significance, in order to maintain 32 bit counters in software."
"An entry contains the 802.5 statistics for a particular interface.
"The value of this object identifies the 802.5 interface for which this entry contains management information.
The value of this object for a particular interface has the same value as MIB II's ifIndex object for the same interface."
{ dot5StatsEntry 1 } dot5StatsLineErrors OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
"This counter is incremented when a frame or token is copied or repeated by a station, the E bit is zero in the frame or token and one of the following conditions exists:
1) there is a non data bit (J or K bit) between the SD and the ED of the frame or token, or 2) there is an FCS error in the frame."
"This counter is incremented when a station detects the absence of transitions for five half bit timers (burst five error)."
{ dot5StatsEntry 3 } dot5StatsACErrors OBJECT
"This counter is incremented when a station receives an AMP or SMP frame in which A is equal to C is equal to 0, and then receives another SMP frame with A
is equal to 0 without first receiving an AMP frame.
It denotes a station that cannot set the AC bits properly."
"This counter is incremented when a station transmits an abort delimiter while transmitting."
"This counter is incremented when a station recognizes an internal error."
"This counter is incremented when a station is transmitting and its TRR timer expires.
This condition denotes a condition where a transmitting station in strip mode does not receive the trailer of the frame before the TRR timer goes off."
"This counter is incremented when a station recognizes a frame addressed to its specific address, but has no available buffer space indicating that the station is congested."
"This counter is incremented when a station recognizes a frame addressed to its specific address and detects that the FS field A bits are set to 1 indicating a possible line hit or duplicate address."
"This counter is incremented when a station acting as the active monitor recognizes an error condition that needs a token transmitted."
"The number of Soft Errors the interface has detected.
It directly corresponds to the number of Report Error MAC frames that this interface has transmitted.
Soft Errors are those which are recoverable by the MAC layer protocols."
{ dot5StatsEntry 11 } dot5StatsHardErrors OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
"The number of times this interface has detected an immediately recoverable fatal error.
It denotes the number of times this interface is either transmitting or receiving beacon MAC frames."
"The number of times this interface has detected the loss of signal condition from the ring."
"The number of times this interface has transmitted a beacon frame."
"The number of Claim Token MAC frames received or transmitted after the interface has received a Ring Purge MAC frame.
This counter signifies the number of times the ring has been purged and is being recovered back into a normal operating state."
"The number of times the interface has detected an open or short circuit in the lobe data path.
The adapter will be closed and dot5RingState will signify this condition."
} dot5StatsRemoves OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
"The number of times the interface has received a Remove Ring Station MAC frame request.
"The number of times the interface has sensed that it is the only station on the ring.
This will happen if the interface is the first one up on a ring, or if there is a hardware problem."
"The number of times the interface has detected that the frequency of the incoming signal differs from the expected frequency by more than that specified by the IEEE 802.5 standard."
This group contains the values of timers for 802.5   interfaces.
This table is obsolete, but its definition   is retained here for backwards compatibility.
"This table contains Token Ring interface timer values, one entry per 802.5 interface."
A list of Token Ring timer values for an 802.5 interface.
The value of this object for a particular interface has the same value as MIB II's ifIndex object for the same interface."
"The time out value used to ensure the interface will return to Repeat State, in units of 100 micro seconds.
The value should be greater than the maximum ring latency."
Maximum period of time a station is permitted to transmit frames after capturing a token, in units of 100 micro seconds."
"The time out value for enqueuing of an SMP PDU after reception of an AMP or SMP frame in which the A and C bits were equal to 0, in units of 100 micro seconds."
{ dot5TimerEntry 4 } dot5TimerValidTransmit OBJECT TYPE
"The time out value used by the active monitor to detect the absence of valid transmissions, in units of 100 micro seconds."

"The time out value which determines how often a station shall send a Report Error MAC frame to report its error counters, in units of 100 micro seconds."
"The time out value which determines how long a station shall remain in the state of transmitting Beacon frames before entering the Bypass state, in units of 100 micro seconds."
"The time out value which determines how long a station shall receive Beacon frames from its downstream neighbor before entering the Bypass state, in units of 100 micro seconds."
A test to be performed is identified   as an OBJECT IDENTIFIER.
"Invoking this test causes the station to test the insert ring logic of the hardware if the station's lobe media cable is connected to a wiring concentrator.
Note that this command inserts the station into the network, and thus, could cause problems if the station is connected to a operational network."
However, the following   definitions are retained for backwards compatibility.

This memo has the following differences from RFC 1231: (1)
This memo is formatted using the SNMPv2 SMI.
The relationship of the "open" and "close" states of dot5Commands to the value of ifAdminStatus has been clarified.
In particular, the setting of one affects the value of the other.
The relationship dot5RingSpeed and ifSpeed has been clarified.
In particular, ifSpeed indicates the current ring speed; dot5RingSpeed indicates the ring speed at the next insertion into the ring.
If the interface doesn't support changing ring speed, then dot5RingSpeed can only be set to its current value.
When dot5RingSpeed has the value 'unknown(1)', the ring speed is to be set to the ring's actual ring speed.
(4)  Write access to dot5ActMonParticipate is not required, and a change to the value of dot5ActMonParticipate does not take effect until the next Active Monitor election.
access to dot5Functional is not required.
A new object, dot5LastBeaconSent has been defined to contain the timestamp of the last beacon frame sent.
The dot5TimerTable has been designated as obsolete.
(8)  Text has been added describing the applicability of RFC 1573 [6] to 802.5 interfaces.
(9)  Other minor editorial changes.
Security Considerations Security issues are not discussed in this memo.
