  - "Abstract\n   This document defines the text/red MIME sub-type.  \"Red\" is short\
    \ for\n   redundant.  The actual RTP packetization for this MIME type is\n   specified\
    \ in RFC 2198.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Text is an important component of any multimedia communication\n\
    \   system.  Like audio, the transport of text can benefit from the use\n   of\
    \ redundancy in order to improve reliability and end-user\n   experience.\n  \
    \ RFC 2198 [1] defines an RTP [2] payload format for redundant audio\n   data.\
    \  The format defined in that document is quite suitable for\n   providing redundancy\
    \ for text, as well as audio.\n   RFC 4103 [8] specifies one usage of RFC 2198\
    \ and the text/red MIME\n   type for the transport of redundant text data.\n \
    \  This memo provides the MIME sub-type registration information for\n   text/red.\
    \  While this document focuses on the use of this MIME sub-\n   type in SDP [5],\
    \ the application of this MIME sub-type is not\n   restricted to SDP.\n"

  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   One new MIME sub-type has been registered by the\
    \ IANA, as described\n   below:\n   MIME media type name: text\n   MIME subtype\
    \ name: RED\n   Required parameters:\n      rate: the RTP clock rate of the payload\
    \ carried within the RTP\n      packet.  Typically, this rate is 1000, but other\
    \ rates MAY be\n      specified.  This parameter MUST be set equal to the clock\
    \ rate of\n      the text payload format carried as the primary encoding.\n  \
    \    pt: a comma-separated ordered list of RTP payload types\n      enumerating\
    \ the primary, secondary, etc., in accordance with RFC\n      2198.  Because comma\
    \ is a special character, the list MUST be a\n      quoted-string (enclosed in\
    \ double quotes).  For static payload\n      types, each list element is simply\
    \ the type number.  For dynamic\n      payload types, each list element is a mapping\
    \ of the dynamic\n      payload type number to an embedded MIME content-type specification\n\
    \      for the payload format corresponding to the dynamic payload type.\n   \
    \   The format of the mapping is:\n               dynamic-payload-type \"=\" content-type\n\
    \      If the content-type string includes a comma, then the content-\n      type\
    \ string MUST be a quoted-string.  If the content-type string\n      does not\
    \ include a comma, it MAY still be quoted.  Because it is\n      part of the list,\
    \ which must itself be a quoted-string, the\n      quotation marks MUST be quoted\
    \ with backslash quoting as specified\n      in RFC 2045 [4].  If the content-type\
    \ string itself contains a\n      quoted-string, then the requirement for backslash\
    \ quoting is\n      recursively applied.\n   Optional parameters: ptime, maxptime\
    \ (these attributes are originally\n      defined in RFC 2327 [5] and RFC 3267\
    \ [6], respectively)\n   Restrictions on Usage:\n      This type is defined only\
    \ for transfer via RTP.\n      It shall not be defined for a storage format.\n\
    \   Encoding considerations:\n      See restrictions on Usage above; this section\
    \ is included per\n      the requirements in RFC 3555 [7].\n   Security considerations:\
    \ Refer to section 5 of RFC 4102.\n   Interoperability considerations: none\n\
    \   Published specification: RFC 2198\n   Applications which use this media type:\n\
    \      Text streaming and conferencing tools.\n   Additional information: none\n\

- title: 4.  Mapping to SDP Parameters
  contents:
  - "4.  Mapping to SDP Parameters\n   The information carried in the MIME media type\
    \ specification has a\n   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description\
    \ Protocol (SDP)\n   [5], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When\
    \ SDP is\n   used to specify sessions employing the RFC 2198 in a text session,\n\
    \   the mapping is as follows:\n   -  The MIME type (\"text\") goes in SDP \"\
    m=\" as the media name.\n   -  The value of the parameter \"rate\" goes in SDP\
    \ \"a=rtpmap\".\n   -  The MIME subtype (RED) goes in SDP \"a=rtpmap\" as the\
    \ encoding\n      name.\n   -  The parameters \"ptime\" and \"maxptime\" go in\
    \ the SDP \"a=ptime\" and\n      \"a=maxptime\" attributes, respectively.\n  \
    \ -  The pt parameter is mapped to an a=fmtp attribute by eliminating\n      the\
    \ parameter name (pt) and changing the commas to slashes.  For\n      example,\
    \ 'pt=\"101,102\"' maps to 'a=fmtp:99 101/102', where = '99'\n      is the payload\
    \ type of the redundancy frames.  Note that the\n      single quote marks (')\
    \ used in this example are not present in the\n      actual message encoding,\
    \ but are present here only for\n      readability.  The level of redundancy is\
    \ shown by the number of\n      elements in the payload type list.\n   Any dynamic\
    \ payload type in the list MUST be represented by its\n   payload type number\
    \ and not by its content-type.  The mapping of\n   payload types to the content-type\
    \ is done using the normal SDP\n   procedures with \"a=rtpmap\".\n   An example\
    \ of SDP is:\n        m=text 11000 RTP/AVP 98 100\n        a=rtpmap:98 t140/1000\n\
    \        a=rtpmap:100 red/1000\n        a=fmtp:100 98/98\n   For each redundancy\
    \ payload type defined, the ordering of the primary\n   and redundancy encoding(s)\
    \ is fixed.  If more than one combination of\n   primary and redundancy encoding(s)\
    \ is desired, multiple redundancy\n   payload types needs to be defined.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations listed in RFC 2198\
    \ apply.  Further, it\n   should be understood that text data, perhaps even more\
    \ so than audio\n   data, is susceptible to unwanted modification that may lead\
    \ to\n   undesired results.  To prevent modification of the primary,\n   secondary,\
    \ or header information, payload integrity protection over\n   at least the complete\
    \ RTP packet is RECOMMENDED, for example using\n   SRTP [9].\n"
