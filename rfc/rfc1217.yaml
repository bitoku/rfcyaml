  - "Date: 4/1/91\n   The Consortium for Slow Commotion Research (CSCR) [1] is pleased\
    \ to\n   respond to your research program announcement (RFC 1216) on Ultra\n \
    \  Low-Speed Networking (ULSNET).  CSCR proposes to carry out a major\n   research\
    \ and development program on low-speed, low-efficiency\n   networks over a period\
    \ of several eons.  Several designs are\n   suggested below for your consideration.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Military requirements place a high premium on ultra-robust\
    \ systems\n   capable of supporting communication in extremely hostile\n   environments.\
    \  A major contributing factor in the survivability of\n   systems is a high degree\
    \ of redundancy.  CSCR believes that the\n   system designs offered below exhibit\
    \ extraordinary redundancy\n   features which should be of great interest to DARPA\
    \ and the\n   Department of Defense.\n"

  - "2. Jam-Resistant Land Mobile Communications\n   This system uses a highly redundant\
    \ optical communication technique\n   to achieve ultra-low, ultra-robust transmission.\
    \  The basic unit is\n   the M1A1 tank.  Each tank is labelled with the number\
    \ 0 or 1 painted\n   four feet high on the tank turret in yellow, day-glo luminescent\n\
    \   paint.  Several detection methods are under consideration:\n     (a)  A tree\
    \ or sand-dune mounted forward observer (FO) radios\n          to a reach echelon\
    \ main frame computer the binary values\n          of tanks moving in a serial\
    \ column.  The mainframe decodes\n          the binary values and voice-synthesizes\
    \ the alphameric\n          ASCII-encoded messages which is then radioed back\
    \ to the\n          FO.  The FO then dispatches a runner to his unit HQ with\n\
    \          the message.  The system design includes two redundant,\n         \
    \ emergency back-up forward observers in different trees\n          with a third\
    \ in reserve in a foxhole.\n     (b)  Wide-area communication by means of overhead\n\
    \          reconnaissance satellites which detect the binary signals\n       \
    \   from the M1A1 mobile system and download this\n          information for processing\
    \ in special U.S. facilities in the\n          Washington, D.C. area.  A Convection\
    \ Machine [2] system\n          will be used to perform a codebook table look-up\
    \ to decode\n          the binary message.  The decoded message will be relayed\n\
    \          by morse-code over a packet meteor burst communications\n         \
    \ channel to the appropriate Division headquarters.\n     (c)  An important improvement\
    \ in the sensitivity of this system\n          can be obtained by means of a coherent\
    \ detection strategy.\n          Using long baseline interferometry, phase differences\n\
    \          among the advancing tank column elements will be used to\n        \
    \  signal a secondary message to select among a set of\n          codebooks in\
    \ the Convenction Machine.  The phase analysis\n          will be carried out\
    \ using Landsat imagery enhanced by\n          suitable processing at the Jet\
    \ Propulsion Laboratory.  The\n          Landsat images (of the moving tanks)\
    \ will be correlated\n          with SPOT Image images to obtain the phase-encoded\n\
    \          information.  The resulting data will be faxed to\n          Washington,\
    \ D.C., for use in the Convection Machine\n          decoding step.  The remainder\
    \ of this process is as for (b)\n          above.\n     (d)  It is proposed to\
    \ use SIMNET to simulate this system.\n"

  - "3. Low Speed Undersea Communication\n   Using the 16\" guns of the Battleship\
    \ Missouri, a pulse-code modulated\n   message will be transmitted via the Pacific\
    \ Ocean to the Ames\n   Research Center in California.  Using a combination of\
    \ fixed and\n   towed acoustic hydrophone arrays, the PCM signal will be detected,\n\
    \   recorded, enhanced and analyzed both at fixed installations and\n   aboard\
    \ undersea vessels which have been suitably equipped.  An\n   alternative acoustic\
    \ source is to use M1A1 main battle tanks firing\n   150 mm H.E. ordnance.  It\
    \ is proposed to conduct tests of this method\n   in the Persian Gulf during the\
    \ summer of 1991.\n"
- title: 4. Jam-Resistant Underwater Communication
  contents:
  - "4. Jam-Resistant Underwater Communication\n   The ULS system proposed in (2)\
    \ above has the weakness that it is\n   readily jammed by simple depth charge\
    \ explosions or other sources of\n   acoustic noise (e.g., Analog Equipment Corporation\
    \ DUCK-TALK voice\n   synthesizers linked with 3,000 AMP amplifiers).  An alternative\
    \ is to\n   make use of the ultimate in jam resistance: neutrino transmission.\n\
    \   For all practical purposes, almost nothing (including several light-\n   years\
    \ of lead) will stop a neutrino.  There is, however, a slight\n   cross-section\
    \ which can be exploited provided that a cubic mile of\n   sea water is available\
    \ for observing occasional neutrino-chlorine\n   interactions which produce a\
    \ detectable photon burst.  Thus, we have\n   the basis for a highly effective,\
    \ extremely low speed communication\n   system for communicating with submarines.\n\
    \   There are a few details to be worked out:\n     (a)  the only accelerator\
    \ available to us to generate neutrino\n          bursts is located at Batavia\
    \ National Laboratory (BNL).\n     (b)  the BNL facility can only send neutrino\
    \ bursts in one\n          direction (through the center of the Earth) to a site\
    \ near\n          Tierra del Fuego, Chile.  Consequently, all submarines must\n\
    \          be scheduled to pass near Tierra del Fuego on a regular\n         \
    \ basis to coincide with the PCM neutrino signalling from\n          the BNL source.\n\
    \     (c)  the maximum rate of neutrino burst transmission is\n          approximately\
    \ once every 20 seconds.  This high rate can be\n          reduced considerably\
    \ if the pwer source for the accelerator\n          is limited to a rate sustainable\
    \ by discharging a large\n          capacitor which is trickle charged by a 2\
    \ square foot solar\n          panel mounted to face north.\n"
- title: 5. Options for Further Reducing Effective Throughput
  contents:
  - "5. Options for Further Reducing Effective Throughput\n     (a)  Anti-Huffman\
    \ Coding.  The most frequent symbol is\n          assigned the longest code, with\
    \ code lengths reducing with\n          symbol probability.\n     (b)  Minimum\
    \ likelihood decoding.  The least likely\n          interpretation of the detected\
    \ symbol is selected to\n          maximize the probability of decoding error.\n\
    \     (c)  Firefly cryptography.  A random signal (mason jar full of\n       \
    \   fireflies) is used to encipher the transmitted signal by\n          optical\
    \ combining.  At the receiving site, another jar of\n          fireflies is used\
    \ to decipher the message.  Since the\n          correlation between the transmitting\
    \ and receiving firefly\n          jars is essentially nil, the probability of\
    \ successful\n          decipherment is quite low, yielding a very low effective\n\
    \          transmission rate.\n     (d)  Recursive Self-encapsulation.  Since\
    \ it is self-evident that\n          layered communication is a GOOD THING, more\
    \ layers\n          must be better.  It is proposed to recursively encapsulate\n\
    \          each of the 7 layers of OSI, yielding a 49 layer\n          communications\
    \ model.  The redundancy and\n          retransmission and flow control achieved\
    \ by this means\n          should produce an extremely low bandwidth system if,\n\
    \          indeed, any information can be transmitted at all.  It is\n       \
    \   proposed that the top level application layer utilize ASN.1\n          encoded\
    \ in a 32 bit per character set.\n     (e)  Scaling.  The initial M1A1 tank basis\
    \ for the land mobile\n          communication system can be improved.  It is\
    \ proposed to\n          reduce the effective data rate further by replacing the\n\
    \          tanks with shuttle launch vehicles.  The only slower method\n     \
    \     of signalling might be the use of cars on any freeway in the\n         \
    \ Los Angeles area.\n     (f)  Network Management.  It is proposed to adopt the\
    \ Slow\n          Network Management Protocol (SNMP) as a standard for\n     \
    \     ULSNET.  All standard Management Information Base\n          variables will\
    \ be specified in Serbo-Croatian and all\n          computations carried-out in\
    \ reverse-Polish.\n     (g)  Routing.  Two alternatives are proposed:\n      \
    \         (1) Mashed Potato Routing\n               (2) Airline Baggage Routing\
    \ [due to S. Cargo]\n          The former is a scheme whereby any incoming packets\
    \ are\n          stored for long periods of time before forwarding.  If space\n\
    \          for storage becomes a problem, packets are compressed by\n        \
    \  removing bits at random.  Packets are then returned to the\n          sender.\
    \  In the latter scheme, packets are mislabelled at the\n          initial switch\
    \ and randomly labelled as they are moved\n          through the network.  A special\
    \ check is made before\n          forwarding to avoid routing to the actual intended\n\
    \          destination.\n   CSCR looks forward to a protracted and fruitless discussion\
    \ with you\n   on this subject as soon as we can figure out how to transmit the\n\
    \   proposal.\n"
