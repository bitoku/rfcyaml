- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   As of this writing, the BGP Path Attributes registry maintained\
    \ by\n   IANA contains entries for DPA, ADVERTISER, and RCID_PATH /\n   CLUSTER_ID.\
    \  The first of these is associated with [BGPDPA], an\n   Internet-Draft that\
    \ was abandoned in 1996.  The latter are associated\n   with [RFC1863], an RFC\
    \ that was reclassified as Historic by [RFC4223]\n   in 2005.  Neither specification\
    \ is currently in use, nor have they\n   ever been.\n   Note that the deprecated\
    \ CLUSTER_ID is distinct from CLUSTER_LIST\n   [RFC4456].  CLUSTER_LIST is not\
    \ being deprecated.\n"
