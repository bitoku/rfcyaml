    \   selector sub-options, as defined in [RFC6089].\n   The binary traffic selector\
    \ format defined here, allows for efficient\n   identification of flow(s) based\
    \ on well-known fields in IPv4\n   [RFC0791], IPv6 [RFC2460], and transport layer\
    \ headers like TCP\n   [RFC0793] and UDP [RFC0768].\n"

    \    Each flag indicates whether the corresponding field is present in\n     \
    \ the message.\n   (A)Start Source Address\n      This field identifies the first\
    \ source address, from the range of\n      32-bit IPv4 addresses to be matched,\
    \ on data packets sent from a\n      corresponding node to the mobile node as\
    \ seen by the home agent.\n      In other words, this is one of the addresses\
    \ of the correspondent\n      node.\n   (B)End Source Address\n      If more than\
    \ one contiguous source address needs to be matched,\n      then this field can\
    \ be used to indicate the end value of a range\n      starting from the value\
    \ of the Start Source Address field.  This\n      field MUST NOT be included unless\
    \ the Start Source Address field\n      is included.  When this field is included,\
    \ the receiver will match\n      all of the addresses between fields (A) and (B),\
    \ inclusive of (A)\n      and (B).\n   (C)Start Destination Address\n      This\
    \ field identifies the first destination address, from the\n      range of 32-bit\
    \ IPv4 addresses to be matched, on data packets sent\n      from a corresponding\
    \ node to the mobile node as seen by the home\n      agent.  In other words, this\
    \ is one of the registered home\n      addresses of the mobile node.\n   (D)End\
    \ Destination Address\n      If more than one contiguous destination address needs\
    \ to be\n      matched, then this field can be used to indicate the end value\
    \ of\n      a range starting from the value of the Start Destination Address\n\
    \      field.  This field MUST NOT be included unless the Start\n      Destination\
    \ Address field is included.  When this field is\n      included, the receiver\
    \ will match all of the addresses between\n      fields (C) and (D), inclusive\
    \ of (C) and (D).\n   (E)Start IPsec SPI - Security Parameter Index\n      This\
    \ field identifies the first 32-bit IPsec SPI value, from the\n      range of\
    \ SPI values to be matched, on data packets sent from a\n      corresponding node\
    \ to the mobile node as seen by the home agent.\n      This field is defined in\
    \ [RFC4303].\n   (F)End IPsec SPI - Security Parameter Index\n      If more than\
    \ one contiguous SPI value needs to be matched, then\n      this field can be\
    \ used to indicate the end value of a range\n      starting from the value of\
    \ the Start IPsec SPI field.  This field\n      MUST NOT be included unless the\
    \ Start IPsec SPI field is included.\n      When this field is included, the receiver\
    \ will match all of the\n      SPI values between fields (E) and (F), inclusive\
    \ of (E) and (F).\n   (G)Start Source Port\n      This field identifies the first\
    \ 16-bit source port number, from\n      the range of port numbers to be matched,\
    \ on data packets sent from\n      a corresponding node to the mobile node as\
    \ seen by the home agent.\n      This is from the range of port numbers defined\
    \ by IANA\n      (http://www.iana.org).\n   (H)End Source Port\n      If more\
    \ than one contiguous source port number needs to be\n      matched, then this\
    \ field can be used to indicate the end value of\n      a range starting from\
    \ the value of the Start Source Port field.\n      This field MUST NOT be included\
    \ unless the Start Source Port field\n      is included.  When this field is included,\
    \ the receiver will match\n      all of the port numbers between fields (G) and\
    \ (H), inclusive of\n      (G) and (H).\n   (I)Start Destination Port\n      This\
    \ field identifies the first 16-bit destination port number,\n      from the range\
    \ of port numbers to be matched, on data packets sent\n      from a corresponding\
    \ node to the mobile node as seen by the home\n      agent.\n   (J)End Destination\
    \ Port\n      If more than one contiguous destination port number needs to be\n\
    \      matched, then this field can be used to indicate the end value of\n   \
    \   a range starting from the value of the Start Destination Port\n      field.\
    \  This field MUST NOT be included unless the Start\n      Destination Port field\
    \ is included.  When this field is included,\n      the receiver will match all\
    \ of the port numbers between fields (I)\n      and (J), inclusive of (I) and\
    \ (J).\n   (K)Start DS - Differential Services\n      This field identifies the\
    \ first differential services value, from\n      the range of differential services\
    \ values to be matched, on data\n      packets sent from a corresponding node\
    \ to the mobile node as seen\n      by the home agent.  Note that this field is\
    \ called a \"Type of\n      Service field\" in [RFC0791].  [RFC3260] then clarified\
    \ that the\n      field has been redefined as a 6-bit DS field with 2 bits reserved,\n\
    \      later claimed by Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC3168].\n  \
    \    For the purpose of this specification, the (K)Start DS field is 8\n     \
    \ bits long, where the 6 most significant bits indicate the DS field\n      to\
    \ be matched and the 2 least significant bits' values MUST be\n      ignored in\
    \ any comparison.\n   (L)End DS - Differential Services\n      If more than one\
    \ contiguous DS value needs to be matched, then\n      this field can be used\
    \ to indicate the end value of a range\n      starting from the value of the Start\
    \ DS field.  This field MUST\n      NOT be included unless the Start DS field\
    \ is included.  When this\n      field is included, it MUST be coded the same\
    \ way as defined for\n      (K).  When this field is included, the receiver will\
    \ match all of\n      the values between fields (K) and (L), inclusive of (K)\
    \ and (L).\n   (M)Start Protocol\n      This field identifies the first 8-bit\
    \ protocol value, from the\n      range of protocol values to be matched, on data\
    \ packets sent from\n      a corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by\
    \ the home agent.\n   (N)End Protocol\n      If more than one contiguous protocol\
    \ value needs to be matched,\n      then this field can be used to indicate the\
    \ end value of a range\n      starting from the value of the Start Protocol field.\
    \  This field\n      MUST NOT be included unless the Start Protocol field is included.\n\
    \      When this field is included, the receiver will match all of the\n     \
    \ values between fields (M) and (N), inclusive of (M) and (N).\n   Reserved\n\
    \      Reserved for future use.  These bits MUST be set to zero by the\n     \
    \ sender and ignored by the receiver.\n"

    \                  Figure 2: IPv6 binary traffic selector\n   Flags (A-P)\n  \
    \    Each flag indicates whether the corresponding field is present in\n     \
    \ the message\n   (A)Start Source Address\n      This field identifies the first\
    \ source address, from the range of\n      128-bit IPv6 addresses to be matched,\
    \ on data packets sent from a\n      corresponding node to the mobile node as\
    \ seen by the home agent.\n      In other words, this is one of the addresses\
    \ of the correspondent\n      node.\n   (B)End Source Address\n      If more than\
    \ one contiguous source address needs to be matched,\n      then this field can\
    \ be used to indicate the end value of a range\n      starting from the value\
    \ of the Start Source Address field.  This\n      field MUST NOT be included unless\
    \ the Start Source Address field\n      is included.  When this field is included,\
    \ the receiver will match\n      all of the addresses between fields (A) and (B),\
    \ inclusive of (A)\n      and (B).\n   (C)Start Destination Address\n      This\
    \ field identifies the first destination address, from the\n      range of 128-bit\
    \ IPv6 addresses to be matched, on data packets\n      sent from a corresponding\
    \ node to the mobile node as seen by the\n      home agent.  In other words, this\
    \ is one of the registered home\n      addresses of the mobile node.\n   (D)End\
    \ Destination Address\n      If more than one contiguous destination address needs\
    \ to be\n      matched, then this field can be used to indicate the end value\
    \ of\n      a range starting from the value of the Start Destination Address\n\
    \      field.  This field MUST NOT be included unless the Start\n      Destination\
    \ Address field is included.  When this field is\n      included, the receiver\
    \ will match all of the addresses between\n      fields (C) and (D), inclusive\
    \ of (C) and (D).\n   (E)Start IPsec SPI - Security Parameter Index\n      This\
    \ field identifies the first 32-bit IPsec SPI value, from the\n      range of\
    \ SPI values to be matched, on data packets sent from a\n      corresponding node\
    \ to the mobile node as seen by the home agent.\n      This field is defined in\
    \ [RFC4303].\n   (F)End IPsec SPI - Security Parameter Index\n      If more than\
    \ one contiguous SPI value needs to be matched, then\n      this field can be\
    \ used to indicate the end value of a range\n      starting from the value of\
    \ the Start IPsec SPI field.  This field\n      MUST NOT be included unless the\
    \ Start IPsec SPI field is included.\n      When this field is included, the receiver\
    \ will match all of the\n      SPI values between fields (E) and (F), inclusive\
    \ of (E) and (F).\n   (G)Start Flow Label\n      This field identifies the first\
    \ flow label value, from the range\n      of flow label values to be matched,\
    \ on data packets sent from a\n      corresponding node to the mobile node as\
    \ seen by the home agent.\n      According to [RFC2460], the flow label is 24\
    \ bits long.  For the\n      purpose of this specification, the sender of this\
    \ option MUST\n      prefix the flow label value with 8 bits of \"0\" before inserting\
    \ it\n      in the (G)Start Flow Label field.  The receiver SHOULD ignore the\n\
    \      first 8 bits of this field before using it in comparisons with\n      flow\
    \ labels in packets.\n   (H)End Flow Label\n      If more than one contiguous\
    \ flow label value needs to be matched,\n      then this field can be used to\
    \ indicate the end value of a range\n      starting from the value of the Start\
    \ Flow Label field.  This field\n      MUST NOT be included unless the Start Flow\
    \ Label field is\n      included.  When this field is included, the receiver will\
    \ match\n      all of the flow label values between fields (G) and (H), inclusive\n\
    \      of (G) and (H).  When this field is included, it MUST be coded the\n  \
    \    same way as defined for (G).\n   (I)Start Source Port\n      This field identifies\
    \ the first 16-bit source port number, from\n      the range of port numbers to\
    \ be matched, on data packets sent from\n      a corresponding node to the mobile\
    \ node as seen by the home agent.\n   (J)End Source Port\n      If more than one\
    \ contiguous source port number needs to be\n      matched, then this field can\
    \ be used to indicate the end value of\n      a range starting from the value\
    \ of the Start Source Port field.\n      This field MUST NOT be included unless\
    \ the Start Source Port field\n      is included.  When this field is included,\
    \ the receiver will match\n      all of the port numbers between fields (I) and\
    \ (J), inclusive of\n      (I) and (J).\n   (K)Start Destination Port\n      This\
    \ field identifies the first 16-bit destination port number,\n      from the range\
    \ of port numbers to be matched, on data packets sent\n      from a corresponding\
    \ node to the mobile node as seen by the home\n      agent.\n   (L)End Destination\
    \ Port\n      If more than one contiguous destination port number needs to be\n\
    \      matched, then this field can be used to indicate the end value of\n   \
    \   a range starting from the value of the Start Destination Port\n      field.\
    \  This field MUST NOT be included unless the Start\n      Destination Port field\
    \ is included.  When this field is included,\n      the receiver will match all\
    \ of the port numbers between fields (K)\n      and (L), inclusive of (K) and\
    \ (L).\n   (M)Start TC - Traffic Class\n      This field identifies the first\
    \ traffic class value, from the\n      range of traffic class values to be matched,\
    \ on data packets sent\n      from a corresponding node to the mobile node as\
    \ seen by the home\n      agent.  This field is equivalent to the Start DS field\
    \ in the IPv4\n      traffic selector in Figure 1.  As per [RFC3260], the field\
    \ is\n      defined as a 6-bit DS field with 2 bits reserved, later claimed by\n\
    \      Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC3168].  For the purpose\n  \
    \    of this specification, the (M)Start TC field is 8 bits long, where\n    \
    \  the 6 most significant bits indicate the DS field to be matched\n      and\
    \ the 2 least significant bits' values MUST be ignored in any\n      comparison.\n\
    \   (N)End TC - Traffic Class\n      If more than one contiguous TC value needs\
    \ to be matched, then\n      this field can be used to indicate the end value\
    \ of a range\n      starting from the value of the Start TC field.  This field\
    \ MUST\n      NOT be included unless the Start TC field is included.  When this\n\
    \      field is included, it MUST be coded the same way as defined for\n     \
    \ (M).  When this field is included, the receiver will match all of\n      the\
    \ values between fields (M) and (N), inclusive of (M) and (N).\n   (O)Start NH\
    \ - Next Header\n      This field identifies the first 8-bit next header value,\
    \ from the\n      range of next header values to be matched, on data packets sent\n\
    \      from a corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by the home\n    \
    \  agent.\n   (P)End NH - Next Header\n      If more than one contiguous next\
    \ header value needs to be matched,\n      then this field can be used to indicate\
    \ the end value of a range\n      starting from the value of the Start NH field.\
    \  This field MUST\n      NOT be included unless the Start next header field is\
    \ included.\n      When this field is included, the receiver will match all of\
    \ the\n      values between fields (O) and (P), inclusive of (O) and (P).\n  \
    \ Reserved\n      Reserved for future use.  These bits MUST be set to zero by\
    \ the\n      sender and ignored by the receiver.\n"
