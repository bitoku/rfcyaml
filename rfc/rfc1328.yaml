- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document considers issues of downgrading from X.400(1988) to\n\
    \   X.400(1984) [MHS88a, MHS84].  Annexe B of X.419 specifies some\n   downgrading\
    \ rules [MHS88b], but these are not sufficient for\n   provision of service in\
    \ an environment containing both 1984 and 1988\n   components.  This document\
    \ defines a number of extensions to this\n   annexe.\n   This specification is\
    \ not tutorial.  COSINE Study 8.2 by J.A.I.\n   Craigie gives a useful overview\
    \ [Cra88].\n"
- title: 1.  The need to Downgrade
  contents:
  - "1.  The need to Downgrade\n   It is expected that X.400(1988) systems will be\
    \ extensively deployed,\n   whilst there is still substantial use of X.400(1984).\
    \  If 1988\n   features are to be used, it it important for there to be a clear\n\
    \   approach to downgrading.  This document specifies an approach to\n   downgrading\
    \ for the Internet and COSINE communities.  As 1988 is a\n   strict superset of\
    \ 1984, the mapping is a one-way problem.\n"
- title: 2.  Avoiding Downgrading
  contents:
  - "2.  Avoiding Downgrading\n   Perhaps the most important consideration is to configure\
    \ systems so\n   as to minimise the need for downgrading.  Use of 1984 systems\
    \ to\n   interconnect 1988 systems should be strenuously avoided.\n   In practice,\
    \ many of the downgrading issues will be avoided.  When a\n   1988 originator\
    \ sends to a 1984 recipient, 1988 specific features\n   will not be used as they\
    \ will not work!  For distribution lists with\n   1984 and 1988 recipients, messages\
    \ will tend to be \"lowest common\n   denominator\".\n"
- title: 3.  Addressing
  contents:
  - "3.  Addressing\n   In general there is a problem with O/R addresses which use\
    \ 88\n   specific features.  The X.419 downgrade approach will mean that\n   addresses\
    \ using these features cannot be specified from 84 systems.\n   Worse, a message\
    \ originating from such an address cannot be\n   transferred into X.400(1984).\
    \  This is unacceptable.  Two approaches\n   are defined.  The first is a general\
    \ purpose mechanism, which can be\n   implemented by the gateway only.  The second\
    \ is a special purpose\n   mechanism to optimise for a form of X.400(88) address\
    \ which is\n   expected to be used frequently (Common Name).  The second approach\n\
    \   requires cooperation from all X.400(88) UAs and MTAs which are\n   involved\
    \ in these interactions.\n"
- title: 3.1  General Approach
  contents:
  - "3.1  General Approach\n   The first approach is to use a DDA \"X400-88\".  The\
    \ DDA value is an\n   std-or encoding of the address as defined in RFC 1327 [Kil92].\
    \  This\n   will allow source routing through an appropriate gateway.  This\n\
    \   solution is general, and does not require co-operation.  For example:\n"
- title: '88:'
  contents:
  - "88:\n     PD-ADDRESS=Empire State Building;  PRMD=XX; ADMD=ZZ; C=US;\n"
- title: '84:'
  contents:
  - "84:\n     O=MHS-Relay; PRMD=UK.AC; C=GB;\n     DD.X400-88=/PD-ADDRESS=Empire\
    \ State Building/PRMD=XX/ADMD=ZZ/C=US/;\n   The std-or syntax can use IA5 characters\
    \ not in the printable string\n   set (typically to handle teletext versions).\
    \  To enable this to be\n   handled, the std-or encoded in encapsulated into printable\
    \ string\n   using the mappings of Section 3.4 of RFC 1327.  Where the generated\n\
    \   address is longer than 128 characters, up to three overflow domain\n   defined\
    \ attributes are used:  X400-C1; X400-C2; X400-C3.\n"
- title: 3.2  Common Name
  contents:
  - "3.2  Common Name\n   Where a common name attribute is used, this is downgraded\
    \ to the\n   Domain Defined Attribute \"Common\".  For example:\n   88:\n    \
    \   CN=Postmaster; O=A; ADMD=B; C=GB;\n   84:\n       DD.Common=Postmaster; O=A;\
    \ ADMD=B; C=GB;\n   The downgrade will always happen correctly.  However, it will\
    \ not\n   always be possible for the gateway to do the reverse mapping.\n   Therefore,\
    \ this approach requires that all 1988 MTAs and UAs which\n   wish to interact\
    \ with 1984 systems through gateways following this\n   specification will need\
    \ to understand the equivalence of these two\n   forms of address.\n"
- title: 4.  MTS
  contents:
  - "4.  MTS\n   Annexe B of X.419 is sufficient, apart from the addressing.\n   The\
    \ discard of envelope fields is unfortunate.  However, the\n   criticality mechanism\
    \ ensures that no information the originator\n   specifies to be critical is discarded.\
    \  There is no sensible\n   alternative.  If mapping to a system which support\
    \ the MOTIS-86 trace\n   extensions, it is recommended that the internal trace\
    \ of X.400(88) is\n   mapped on to this, noting the slight differences in syntax.\n"
- title: 5.  IPM Downgrading
  contents:
  - "5.  IPM Downgrading\n   The IPM service in X.400(1984) is usually provided by\
    \ content type 2.\n   In many cases, it will be useful for a gateway to downgrade\
    \ P2 from\n   content type 22 to 2.  This will clearly need to be made dependent\
    \ on\n   the destination, as it is quite possible to carry content type 22\n \
    \  over P1(1984).  The decision to make this downgrade will be on the\n   basis\
    \ of gateway configuration.\n   When a gateway downgrades from 22 to 2, the following\
    \ should be done:\n   1.  Strip any 1988 specific headings (language indication,\
    \ and\n       partial message indication).\n   2.  Downgrade all O/R addresses,\
    \ as described in Section 3.\n   3.  If a directory name is present, there is\
    \ no method to preserve\n       the semantics within a 1984 O/R Address.  However,\
    \ it is\n       possible to pass the information across, so that the information\n\
    \       in the Distinguished Name can be informally displayed to the\n       end\
    \ user.  This is done by appendend a text representation of\n       the Distinguished\
    \ Name to the Free Form Name enclosed in round\n       brackets.  It is recommended\
    \ that the \"User Friendly Name\"\n       syntax is used to represent the Distinguished\
    \ Name [Kil90].  For\n       example:\n       (Steve Hardcastle-Kille, Computer\
    \ Science,\n        University College London, GB)\n   4.  The issue of body part\
    \ downgrade is discussed in Section 6.\n"
- title: 5.1  RFC 822 Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.1  RFC 822 Considerations\n   A message represented as content type 22 may\
    \ have originated from RFC\n   822 [Cro82].  The downgrade for this type of message\
    \ can be improved.\n   This is discussed in RFC 1327 [Kil92].\n"
- title: 6.  Body Part downgrading
  contents:
  - "6.  Body Part downgrading\n   The issue of body part downgrade is very much linked\
    \ up with the\n   whole issue of body part format conversion.  If no explicit\n\
    \   conversion is requested, conversion depends on the MTA knowing the\n   remote\
    \ UA's capabilities.  The following options are available for\n   body part conversion\
    \ in all cases, including this one.  It is assumed\n   that body part conversion\
    \ is avoided where possible.\n   1.  Downgrade to a standard 1984 body part, without\
    \ loss of\n       information\n   2.  Downgrade to a standard 1984 body part,\
    \ with loss of information\n   3.  Discard the body part, and replace with a (typically\
    \ IA5 text)\n       message.  For example:\n       **********************************************\n\
    \       *\n       *  There was a hologram here which could\n       *  not be converted\n\
    \       *\n       **********************************************\n   4.  Bounce\
    \ the message\n   If conversion is prohibited, 4) must be done.  If conversion-with-\n\
    \   loss is prohibited, 1) should be done if possible, otherwise 4).  In\n   other\
    \ cases 2) should be done if possible.  If it is not possible,\n   the choice\
    \ between 3) and 4) should be a configuration choice.  X.419\n   only recognises\
    \ 4).  3) Seems to be a useful choice in practice,\n   particularly where the\
    \ message contains other body parts.  Another\n   option is available when downgrading:\n\
    \      1.  Encapsulate the body part as a Nationally Defined 1984\n          body\
    \ part (body part 7).\n   This should be used when configured for the recipient\
    \ UA.\n"
