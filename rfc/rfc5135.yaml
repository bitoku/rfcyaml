  - "1.  Introduction\n   In order for IP multicast applications to function well\
    \ over NATs,\n   multicast UDP must work as seamlessly as unicast UDP.  However,\
    \ NATs\n   have little consistency in IP multicast operation, which results in\n\
    \   inconsistent user experiences and failed IP multicast operation.\n   This\
    \ document targets requirements intended to enable correct\n   operations of Any\
    \ Source Multicast and Source-Specific Multicast in\n   devices running Internet\
    \ Group Management Protocol (IGMP) proxy\n   routing and NAT and without applying\
    \ NAT to IP multicast group\n   addresses.  This profile of functionality is the\
    \ expected best\n   practice for residential access routers, small branch routers,\
    \ or\n   similar deployments.\n   Most of the principles outlined in this document\
    \ do also apply when\n   using protocols other than IGMP, such as Protocol Independent\n\
    \   Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM), or when performing NAT between\n   multiple\
    \ \"inside\" interfaces, but explicit consideration for these\n   cases is outside\
    \ the scope of this document.\n   This document describes the behavior of a device\
    \ that functions as a\n   NAT for unicast flows and also forwards IP multicast\
    \ traffic in\n   either direction ('inside' to 'outside', or 'outside' to 'inside').\n\
    \   This allows a host 'inside' the NAT to both receive multicast traffic\n  \
    \ and to source multicast traffic.  Hosts on the 'inside' interface(s)\n   of\
    \ a NAT indicate their interest in receiving an IP multicast flow by\n   sending\
    \ an IGMP message to their local interface.  An IP multicast-\n   capable NAT\
    \ will see that IGMP message (IGMPv1 [RFC1112], IGMPv2\n   [RFC2236], IGMPv3 [RFC3376]),\
    \ possibly perform some functions on that\n   IGMP message, and forward it to\
    \ its upstream router.  This causes the\n   upstream router to send that IP multicast\
    \ traffic to the NAT, which\n   forwards it to those 'inside' segment(s) with\
    \ host(s) that had\n   previously sent IGMP messages for that IP multicast traffic.\n\
    \   Out of scope of this document are PIM-SM [RFC4601] and IPv6\n   [RFC2460].\
    \  The IGMP Proxy devices that are scoped in this document\n   do not forward\
    \ PIM-SM.  IPv6 is out of scope because NAT is not\n   considered necessary with\
    \ IPv6.\n   This document is a companion document to \"NAT Behavioral Requirements\n\
    \   for Unicast UDP\" [RFC4787].\n"

    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n   In this document, the term \"NAT\" applies to both\
    \ Network Address and\n   Port Translator (NAPT) as well as a NAT that does not\
    \ translate\n   ports.\n   The term 'inside' refers to the interface(s) on a NAT\
    \ that contain\n   hosts that wish to source or receive IP multicast traffic.\
    \  The term\n   'outside' refers to the interface(s) that the NAT forwards IGMP\n\

    \                Figure 2: Network with NATing IGMP Proxy\n   In IP multicast,\
    \ IGMP is the protocol used by hosts, such as the one\n   shown in Figure 1. \
    \ For the NAT device in Figure 2 to look like the\n   single host for IP multicast\
    \ services towards the DSL/cable modem and\n   to forward IP multicast traffic\
    \ from and to the multiple hosts in the\n   picture, it needs to perform so called\
    \ \"IGMP Proxying\" [RFC4605] --\n   but within the context of also performing\
    \ NAT.  NAT is not covered by\n   [RFC4605].  Adding NAT to IGMP proxying does\
    \ not need to change the\n   processing of the IGMP messages as defined in RFC\
    \ 4605:\n      IGMP messages are never logically forwarded by the IGMP proxying\n\
    \      device, but rather sourced or received by it.  In general, receipt\n  \
    \    of IGMP messages by the device updates the device's IGMP state.\n      The\
    \ updated state changes the device's forwarding of multicast\n      messages or\
    \ triggers the sending of IGMP messages.  \"Forwarding\"\n      of IGMP protocol\
    \ messages may thus only happen implicitly by\n      implementation optimizations\
    \ that create shortcuts in this\n      machinery.\n   This specifically means\
    \ that IGMP protocol packets sent by the NAT\n   device will always use the IP\
    \ address of the interface ('inside' or\n   'outside') from which they are sent,\
    \ but because those packets are\n   logically \"sourced\" and not \"forwarded\"\
    , NAT does not have any impact\n   on this.\n   Unlike unicast flows, packets\
    \ with a multicast destination IP address\n   do not have their destination IP\
    \ address or destination port changed\n   by a NAT.  However, their source IP\
    \ address (and source UDP port, in\n   some cases with a NAPT) is changed if the\
    \ packet goes from an\n   'inside' interface of a NAT to the 'outside' interface\
    \ of a NAT --\n   similar to the behavior of a unicast packet across those same\n\
    \   interfaces.\n   Adding NAT to IGMP proxying changes the processing of IP multicast\n\
    \   data packets forwarded across the IGMP proxying device as described\n   in\
    \ the following sections.  These changes actually simplify the\n   ability to\
    \ deploy IGMP proxying over a device that does *not* perform\n   NAT.\n   With\
    \ an IGMP Proxy NAT Device, IP multicast data traffic sourced from\n   hosts on\
    \ the 'inside' is NATed such that it will look like it is\n   being sourced from\
    \ a host directly connected to the WAN router, thus\n   eliminating all non-standard\
    \ PIM-SM concerns/configurations described\n   in Section 3.2 of [RFC4605].\n"

- title: 4.2.2.  IGMPv3
  contents:
  - "4.2.2.  IGMPv3\n   When an IGMPv3 proxying device receives an IGMP membership\
    \ on an\n   'inside' interface, it creates its own IGMP proxying membership state\n\
    \   and its own IGMP forwarding table.  It then creates an independent\n   IGMP\
    \ membership report on its 'outside' interface reporting the IP\n   multicast\
    \ groups/channels -- but there is no direct relationship or\n   \"forwarding\"\
    \ of IGMP membership reports or queries across the\n   interfaces.  The NAT device\

    \ and forward the IP multicast\n   packet to the 'inside' interface(s) based on\
    \ its IGMP forwarding\n   table.\n   By performing NAT on IGMPv3 membership reports,\
    \ the membership\n   reports appear to originate from a single IGMPv3 reporter\
    \ instead of\n   different reporters.  Because IGMPv3 has different types of\n\
    \   membership reports differentiating between status (IS_INCLUDE,\n   IS_EXCLUDE)\
    \ and change indication (e.g., TO_INCLUDE, TO_EXCLUDE), if\n   a NAT were to interleave\

    \ the NAT would create a sequence of\n   packets that are not compliant with an\
    \ IGMPv3 reporter [RFC3376].\n   For this reason, the following requirements are\
    \ specified:\n   REQ-12:  If a NAT supports IGMPv3, the NAT MUST implement IGMP/MLD\n\
    \            Proxying [RFC4605].  Such compliance causes the NAT to\n        \
    \    aggregate the IGMPv3 membership reports and report only the\n           \
    \ aggregated information upstream.\n   REQ-13:  If a NAT supports IGMPv3, the\
    \ NAT MUST implement Source-\n            Specific Multicast (SSM) for IP [RFC4607]\
    \ and IGMPv3/MLDv2\n            for SSM [RFC4604].\n   Failure to implement IGMP\
    \ aggregation [RFC4605] will cause undesired\n   temporary black holing of IP\
    \ multicast traffic.  For example,\n   consider two hosts behind the same NAT.\
    \  If one host is joining a\n   session at the same time another is leaving the\
    \ session, and the NAT\n   were to merely relay the join and leave upstream, the\

    \   When a host both receives an ASM stream and sends traffic into it,\n   using\
    \ RTP [RFC3550], there is a potential problem if a NAT merely\n   followed the\
    \ requirements of [RFC4787].  The problem is that RTP uses\n   the source transport\
    \ address (source IP address and source UDP port)\n   and the Real-time Transport\
    \ Protocol / RTP Control Protocol (RTP/\n   RTCP) SSRC value to identify session\
    \ members.  If a session member\n   sees the same SSRC arrive from a different\
    \ transport address, that\n   session member will perform RTP collision detection\
    \ (Section 8.2 of\n   [RFC3550]).  If a NAT merely followed the requirements of\
    \ [RFC4787]\n   and timed out a UDP session after 2 minutes of inactivity and\

  - "5.  Requirements Summary\n   This section summarizes the requirements.\n   REQ-1:\
    \   For IP multicast packets that are forwarded to a host(s) on\n            its\
    \ 'inside' interface(s), a NAT MUST NOT modify the\n            destination IP\
    \ address or destination port of the packets.\n   REQ-2:   A NAT MUST forward\
    \ IP multicast UDP datagrams from its\n            'outside' interface to multicast\
    \ receivers on its 'inside'\n            interface(s).\n   REQ-3:   A NAT SHOULD\
    \ forward IP multicast non-UDP protocols (e.g.,\n            PGM [RFC3208], RSVP\
    \ [RFC2205]) from its 'outside' interface\n            to IP multicast receivers\
    \ on its 'inside' interface(s).\n   REQ-4:   A NAT MUST modify the source IP address\
    \ of packets that\n            arrive from an 'inside' interface towards the 'outside'\n\
    \            interface so that those packets use the NAT's 'outside' IP\n    \
    \        address(es).\n            a:  If the NAT also performs port translation\
    \ (that is, it\n                is a NAPT), the NAT MUST also create a mapping\
    \ to allow\n                responses to that IP multicast packet to be received\
    \ by\n                the appropriate host.  For Any Source Multicast, also\n\
    \                see Section 4.3.\n            b:  To allow hosts to learn the\
    \ NAT's 'outside' interface\n                address, the NAT MUST have \"Endpoint-Independent\n\
    \                Mapping\" behavior (REQ-1 of [RFC4787]), no matter if the\n \
    \               destination IP address is a unicast address or an IP\n       \
    \         multicast address.\n            c:  If the NAT has multiple public IP\
    \ addresses, the NAT\n                SHOULD have an address pooling behavior\
    \ of \"Paired\" (as\n                described in Section 4.1 of [RFC4787]) for\
    \ its IP\n                multicast mappings as well as for its unicast UDP\n\
    \                mappings.  This allows a multicast source to discover\n     \
    \           the NAT's public IP address using a unicast address\n            \
    \    discovery mechanism (e.g., [ICE]) and communicate that\n                discovered\
    \ IP address to a multicast receiver.\n   REQ-5:   A NAT MUST forward IP multicast\
    \ UDP datagrams from its\n            'inside' interface(s) to its 'outside' interface.\n\
    \            a:  NATs that support the above requirement MUST also\n         \
    \       provide a configuration option to disable this feature.\n            \
    \    Otherwise, a multihomed network would cause duplicate\n                instances\
    \ of the multicast data traffic on the public\n                network.\n   REQ-6:\
    \   The NAT's default configuration MUST NOT forward\n            administratively\
    \ scoped IP multicast traffic (239.0.0.0/8)\n            [RFC2365] from its 'inside'\
    \ interface(s) to its 'outside'\n            interface.\n   REQ-7:   The NAT MUST\
    \ NOT forward Local Network Control Block\n            (224.0.0/24) [RFC3171]\
    \ (also known as \"link-local\n            multicast\") traffic from its 'inside'\
    \ interface(s) to its\n            'outside' interface.\n   REQ-8:   A NAT MAY\
    \ support IGMPv1 (although IGMPv1 is considered\n            obsolete).\n   REQ-9:\
    \   A NAT MUST support IGMPv2.\n   REQ-10:  A NAT SHOULD support IGMPv3.\n   REQ-11:\
    \  If a NAT supports IGMPv1 and/or IGMPv2 (but not IGMPv3), the\n            NAT\
    \ MAY simply receive IGMP membership reports on the\n            'inside' interface,\
    \ NAT them, and relay the IGMP membership\n            report, and do the same\
    \ function in the opposite direction\n            to the IGMP listeners.  That\
    \ is, the NAT does not need to do\n            any aggregation of IGMP messages.\n\
    \            a:  If a NAT relays IGMPv1 or IGMPv2 messages in this\n         \
    \       manner, it MUST NOT decrement the TTL of the IGMP\n                messages,\
    \ as they are already sent with TTL=1.\n            b:  However, it is RECOMMENDED\
    \ that such a NAT implement\n                IGMP/MLD Proxying [RFC4605], because\
    \ IGMP aggregation\n                provides a useful optimization.\n   REQ-12:\
    \  If a NAT supports IGMPv3, the NAT MUST implement IGMP/MLD\n            Proxying\
    \ [RFC4605].  Such compliance causes the NAT to\n            aggregate the IGMPv3\
    \ membership reports and report only the\n            aggregated information upstream.\n\
    \   REQ-13:  If a NAT supports IGMPv3, the NAT MUST implement Source-\n      \
    \      Specific Multicast (SSM) for IP [RFC4607] and IGMPv3/MLDv2\n          \
    \  for SSM [RFC4604].\n   REQ-14:  If a host on the 'inside' interface of a NAT\
    \ belongs to an\n            Any Source Multicast host group and the host sends\
    \ a UDP\n            packet to the same group, the NAT SHOULD have a UDP mapping\n\
    \            timer of 60 minutes for that mapping.\n            a:  This UDP mapping\
    \ SHOULD be destroyed when the host\n                leaves that host group. \
    \ The NAT is aware of this\n                through receipt of an IGMP message\
    \ from the host.\n            b:  If a NAT has exhausted its resources, the NAT\
    \ MAY time\n                out that mapping before 60 minutes have elapsed, but\n\
    \                this is discouraged.  Note that even in a situation with\n  \
    \              resource exhaustion, a NAT is still required to follow\n      \
    \          the minimum mapping duration of 2 minutes (REQ-5 of\n             \
    \   [RFC4787]).\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The Security Considerations sections of IGMPv3\
    \ [RFC3376] and IGMP\n   Proxying [RFC4605] apply to a device complying with this\
    \ document.\n   When a host is using RTP and participating in an Any Source Multicast\n\
    \   session, the host's periodic RTCP receiver reports cause the NAT to\n   create\
    \ a mapping.  When the group size is less than approximately\n   300, the RTCP\
    \ reports are sent frequently enough that a NAT's mapping\n   will always be kept\
    \ open.  When the group size is larger than\n   approximately 300, the RTCP reports\
    \ are sent less frequently.  The\n   recommendation in Section 4.3 causes the\
    \ NAT mapping to be kept open\n   for the duration of the host's participation\

    \ periodicity of\n   the host's RTCP transmissions.\n"

- title: Appendix A.  Application Considerations
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Application Considerations\n   SSM requires listeners to know the\
    \ SSM channel (S,G), which is\n   comprised of the IP source address (S) and the\
    \ IP multicast group\n   (G).  An SSM source needs to communicate its IP address\
    \ in its SSM\n   session establishment message (e.g., in its Session Description\n\
    \   Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566]).  When the SSM sender is behind a NAT and\n   the\
    \ SSM receiver(s) are on the other side of that NAT, the SSM sender\n   will need\
    \ to determine its IP source address relevant to the SSM\n   receivers; generally,\
    \ this will be the 'outside' IP address of the\n   NAT.  This 'outside' address\
    \ needs to be included in the SSM session\n   establishment message (e.g., SDP)\
    \ so that listeners on the 'outside'\n   of the NAT can receive the SSM channel.\n\
    \   If there are SSM listeners on both the 'outside' and 'inside' of the\n   NAT,\
    \ it may be valuable to consider using ICE [ICE] in the session\n   advertisement;\
    \ the full scope of the interaction between SSM and ICE\n   is beyond the scope\
    \ of this document.\n   If multiple SSM sources on the 'inside' of a NAT choose\
    \ the same\n   multicast group address, those sources are uniquely identifiable\n\
    \   because their IP addresses are unique.  However, if their multicast\n   traffic\
    \ is NATed and sent on the NAT's public interface, the traffic\n   from those\
    \ individual sources is no longer uniquely identifiable.\n   This will cause problems\
    \ for multicast receivers, which will see an\n   intermixing of traffic from those\
    \ sources.  Resolution of this issue\n   is left for future study.  In the meantime,\
    \ applications that source\n   SSM multicast traffic are encouraged to allow the\
    \ user to modify the\n   multicast SSM address so that users can avoid this problem\
    \ if that\n   application is placed behind a NAT.\n   A multicast source that\
    \ wants its traffic to not traverse a router\n   (e.g., leave a home network)\
    \ may find it useful to send traffic with\n   IP TTL=1.  Both ASM and SSM sources\
    \ may find this useful.\n   As many NATs use the same private address space (e.g.,\n\
    \   192.168.0.0/16, [RFC1918]), RTP stacks are encouraged to generate\n   CNAMEs\
    \ properly (see end of Section 6.5.1 of [RFC3550].)\n"
