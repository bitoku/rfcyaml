- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The global IPv4 address free pool at IANA was exhausted\
    \ in February\n   2011.  Service providers will now have a hard time finding enough\n\
    \   IPv4 global addresses to sustain product and subscriber growth.  Due\n   to\
    \ the huge existing global infrastructure, both hardware and\n   software, vendors,\
    \ and service providers must continue to support\n   IPv4 technologies for the\
    \ foreseeable future.  As legacy applications\n   and hardware are retired, the\
    \ reliance on IPv4 will diminish;\n   however, this is a process that will take\
    \ years, perhaps decades.\n   To maintain legacy IPv4 address support, service\
    \ providers will have\n   little choice but to share IPv4 global addresses among\
    \ multiple\n   customers.  Techniques to do so are outside of the scope of this\n\
    \   document.  All include some form of address translation/address\n   sharing,\
    \ being NAT44 [RFC3022], NAT64 [RFC6146] or DS-Lite [DS-LITE].\n   The effects\
    \ on the Internet of the introduction of those address\n   sharing techniques\
    \ have been documented in [RFC6269].\n   Address sharing techniques come with\
    \ their own logging infrastructure\n   to track the relation between which original\
    \ IP address and source\n   port(s) were associated with which user and external\
    \ IPv4 address at\n   any given point in time.  In the past, to support abuse\
    \ mitigation or\n   public safety requests, the knowledge of the external global\
    \ IP\n   address was enough to identify a subscriber of interest.  With\n   address\
    \ sharing technologies, only providing information about the\n   external public\
    \ address associated with a session to a service\n   provider is no longer sufficient\
    \ information to unambiguously\n   identify customers.\n   Note: This document\
    \ provides recommendations for Internet-facing\n   servers logging incoming connections.\
    \  It does not provide any\n   recommendations about logging on carrier-grade\
    \ NAT or other address\n   sharing tools.\n"
- title: 2.  Recommendations
  contents:
  - "2.  Recommendations\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"\
    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n   It is RECOMMENDED as best current practice that Internet-facing\n\
    \   servers logging incoming IP addresses from inbound IP traffic also\n   log:\n\
    \   o  The source port number.\n   o  A timestamp, RECOMMENDED in UTC, accurate\
    \ to the second, from a\n      traceable time source (e.g., NTP [RFC5905]).\n\
    \   o  The transport protocol (usually TCP or UDP) and destination port\n    \
    \  number, when the server application is defined to use multiple\n      transports\
    \ or multiple ports.\n   Discussion: Carrier-grade NATs may have different policies\
    \ to recycle\n   ports; some implementations may decide to reuse ports almost\n\
    \   immediately, some may wait several minutes before marking the port\n   ready\
    \ for reuse.  As a result, servers have no idea how fast the\n   ports will be\
    \ reused and, thus, should log timestamps using a\n   reasonably accurate clock.\
    \  At this point, the RECOMMENDED accuracy\n   for timestamps is to the second\
    \ or better.  Representation of\n   timestamps in UTC is preferred to local time\
    \ with UTC-offset or time\n   zone, as this extra information can be lost in the\
    \ reporting chain.\n   Examples of Internet-facing servers include, but are not\
    \ limited to,\n   web servers and email servers.\n   Although the deployment of\
    \ address sharing techniques is not foreseen\n   in IPv6, the above recommendations\
    \ apply to both IPv4 and IPv6, if\n   only for consistency and code simplification\
    \ reasons.\n   Discussions about data-retention policies are out of scope for\
    \ this\n   document.  Server security and transport security are important for\n\
    \   the protection of logs for Internet-facing systems.  The operator of\n   the\
    \ Internet-facing server must consider the risks, including the\n   data and services\
    \ on the server, to determine the appropriate\n   measures.  The protection of\
    \ logs is critical in incident\n   investigations.  If logs are tampered with,\
    \ evidence could be\n   destroyed.\n   The above recommendations also apply to\
    \ devices such as load-\n   balancers logging incoming connections on behalf of\
    \ actual servers.\n   The above recommendations apply to current logging practices.\
    \  They\n   do not require any changes in the way logging is performed; e.g.,\n\
    \   which packets are examined and logged.\n"
- title: 3.  ISP Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  ISP Considerations\n   ISP deploying IP address sharing techniques should\
    \ also deploy a\n   corresponding logging architecture to maintain records of\
    \ the\n   relation between a customer's identity and IP/port resources\n   utilized.\
    \  However, recommendations on this topic are out of scope\n   for this document.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   In the absence of the source port number and\
    \ accurate timestamp\n   information, operators deploying any address sharing\
    \ techniques will\n   not be able to identify unambiguously customers when dealing\
    \ with\n   abuse or public safety queries.\n"
