It was specifically defined for the "http" and "https" URI schemes.
The present memo formally updates RFC 6455, which defines the URI schemes defined for the WebSocket Protocol, to extend the use of these well known URIs to those URI schemes.
It also contains an IANA registry for URI suffixes to be used with this path prefix for forming well known URIs.
In [RFC5785], this mechanism is specifically defined for the "http" and "https" URI schemes (now defined in [RFC7230]).
Other URI schemes such as "coap" and "coaps" [RFC7252] have since picked up this mechanism, sharing the registry of URI suffixes with that for HTTP(S).
[RFC6455], which defines the URI schemes defined for the WebSocket Protocol, "
ws" and "wss", does not define the use of well known URIs for these URI schemes.
The present memo formally updates [RFC6455] to extend the use of [RFC5785] well known URIs to the URI schemes "ws" and "wss".
Well known URIs for "ws" and "wss" share the registry for URI suffixes established by [RFC5785]; no change is necessitated by the present memo in the registry or its IANA considerations.
This document does not require any IANA actions.
The Security Considerations of [RFC5785] apply and need to be considered for all well known URIs.
It has always been possible to form "ws" and "wss" URIs in such a way that they map to well known HTTP(S)
URIs when using the procedure in Section 4 of [RFC6455]; no new security considerations are created by now formally making the well known URI mechanism available for "ws" and "wss".
However, with well known URIs becoming available for the WebSocket Protocol, applications that want to define well known URI suffixes specifically for WebSocket use also need to consider whether the resources becoming available under the equivalent HTTP(S)
URI formed by Section 4 of [RFC6455] pose any information disclosure or other security considerations.
