- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   RFC 6514 created a space of Tunnel Type code points for a new BGP\n\
    \   attribute called the \"P-Multicast Service Interface Tunnel (PMSI\n   Tunnel)\
    \ attribute\".  However, the RFC did not create a corresponding\n   IANA registry.\n\
    \   There now is need to make further code point allocations from this\n   name\
    \ space.  This document serves to update RFC 6514 in that it\n   creates an IANA\
    \ registry for that purpose.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   In 'BGP Encodings and Procedures for Multicast in MPLS/BGP\
    \ IP VPNs'\n   [RFC6514], an optional transitive BGP attribute called the\n  \
    \ \"P-Multicast Service Interface Tunnel (PMSI Tunnel) attribute\" is\n   specified.\
    \  This BGP attribute uses an octet field to specify the\n   PMSI tunnel type.\
    \  RFC 6514 allocates the values 0-7.\n   There is now a need to make further\
    \ code point allocations from this\n   name space.  In particular, \"Inter-Area\
    \ P2MP Segmented LSPs\"\n   [SEAMLESS-MCAST] needs to make such an allocation.\
    \  However, the RFC\n   did not create an IANA registry for these code points.\n\
    \   This document creates a new IANA registry called \"P-Multicast Service\n \
    \  Interface Tunnel (PMSI Tunnel) Tunnel Types\" for these code points.\n   The\
    \ registry is created in the \"Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)\n   Parameters\"\
    \ registry.\n   Creating this registry is an update of RFC 6514 [RFC6514].\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has created a new registry called \"P-Multicast\

    \ 0x00 to 0xFA is IETF Review\n   [RFC5226].  Values 0xFB to 0xFE are experimental\
