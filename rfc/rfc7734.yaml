- title: 3.  Solution Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Solution Overview\n   The EVPN solution for SPBM, as specified in [IEEE.802.1Q],\n\
    \   incorporates control-plane interworking in the PE to map ISIS-SPB\n   [RFC6329]\
    \ information elements into the EVPN Next Layer Reachability\n   Information (NLRI)\
    \ and vice versa.  This requires each PE to act both\n   as an EVPN BGP speaker\
    \ and as an ISIS-SPB edge node.  Associated with\n   this are procedures for configuring\
    \ the forwarding operations of the\n   PE such that an arbitrary number of EVPN-attached\
    \ SPBM islands can be\n   interconnected without any topological or multipathing\
    \ dependencies.\n   This model also permits PBB PEs as defined in [RFC7623] to\
    \ seamlessly\n   communicate with the SPBM islands.\n                        \

    \        Figure 1: PBB and SPBM EVPN Network\n   Figure 1 illustrates the generalized\
    \ space addressed by this memo.\n   SPBM networks may be multihomed onto an IP/MPLS\
    \ network that\n   implements EVPN for the purpose of interconnecting with other\
    \ SPBM\n   networks and/or PBB PEs.  The multipathing configuration of each SPBM\n\
    \   network can be unique as the backbone VLAN ID (B-VID) configuration\n   (how\
    \ multipathing is performed in SPBM) is not propagated across the\n   IP/MPLS\
    \ network implementing EVPN.  As with PBB networking, the B-VID\n   is local to\
    \ the SPBM network, so in SPBM a B-MAC associated with the\n   B-VID is advertised\
    \ with the supported I-SIDs at the PBB gateway.\n   Each EVPN is identified by\
    \ a route target.  I-SID-based load-\n   balancing as specified in [RFC7623] allows\
    \ multiple gateways per\n   B-VID (each with different I-SIDs) across the EVPN;\
    \ it is supported\n   by the interworking between PBBNs and SPBM networks.  However,\
    \ SPBM\n   only allows a single active designated forwarder (DF) per B-VID as\n\
    \   described below.  The route target identifies the set of SPBM islands\n  \
    \ and PBB PEs that are allowed to communicate.  Each SPBM island is\n   administered\
    \ to have an Ethernet Segment ID (ESI) Label extended\n   community associated\
    \ with it.\n   BGP acts as a common repository of the I-Component Service ID (I-SID)\n\
    \   attachment points for the set of attached PEs / SPBM islands.  This\n   is\
    \ in the form of {B-MAC address, I-SID, Tx-Rx-attribute} tuples.\n   BGP distributes\
    \ I-SID information into each SPBM island on the basis\n   of locally registered\
    \ interest.  If an SPBM island has no Backbone\n   Edge Bridges (BEBs) registering\
    \ interest in a particular I-SID,\n   information about that I-SID from other\
    \ SPBM islands, PBB PEs, or\n   PBBNs MUST NOT be leaked into the local ISIS-SPB\
    \ routing system.  For\n   each B-VID in an SPBM island, a single SPBM-PE MUST\
    \ be elected the DF\n   for the B-VID.  An SPBM-PE can be a DF for more than one\
    \ B-VID.  This\n   is described further in Section 4.2.  The SPBM-PE originates\
    \ IS-IS\n   advertisements as if it were an IB-BEB that proxies for the other\n\
    \   SPBM islands and PBB PEs in the EVPN defined by the route target, but\n  \
    \ the PE typically will not actually host any I-components.\n   An SPBM-PE that\
    \ is a DF for a B-VID MUST strip the B-VID tag\n   information from frames relayed\
    \ towards the EVPN.  The DF MUST also\n   insert the appropriate B-VID tag information\
    \ into frames relayed\n   towards the SPBM island on the basis of the local I-SID/B-VID\n\
    \   bindings advertised in ISIS-SPB.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Elements of Procedure\n   A PE MUST implement and perform the following procedures.\n"
- title: 4.1.  PE Configuration
  contents:
  - "4.1.  PE Configuration\n   At SPBM island commissioning a PE is configured with:\n\
    \   1) The route target for the service instance.  Where a route target\n    \
    \  is defined as identifying the set of SPBM islands, PBBNs and\n      PBB PEs\
    \ are to be interconnected by the EVPN.\n   2) The unique ESI for the SPBM island.\
    \  Mechanisms for deriving a\n      unique ESI for the SPBM island are out of\
    \ scope.\n   The following is configured as part of commissioning an ISIS-SPB\n\
    \   node:\n   1) A Shortest Path Source ID (SPSourceID) used for algorithmic\n\
    \      construction of multicast addresses.  Note this is required for\n     \
    \ SPBM BEB operation independent of the EVPN operation.\n   2) The set of B-VIDs\
    \ used in the SPBM island and multipathing\n      algorithm IDs to use for each.\
    \  The set of B-VIDs and multipathing\n      algorithms used can be different\
    \ in different domains.  Therefore,\n      the B-VID is local to an SPBM domain\
    \ and is removed for frames\n      carried over the IP/MPLS network.\n   A Type\
    \ 1 Route Distinguisher for the node can be auto-derived.  The\n   actual procedure\
    \ is out of scope for this document.\n"
- title: 4.2.  DF Election
  contents:
  - "4.2.  DF Election\n   PEs self-appoint themselves for the role of DF for a B-VID\
    \ for a\n   given SPBM island.  The procedure used is as per Section 8.5\n   (Designated\
    \ Forwarder Election) of [RFC7432].\n   A PE that assumes the role of DF for a\
    \ given B-VID is responsible for\n   originating specific information into BGP\
    \ from ISIS-SPB and vice\n   versa.  A PE that ceases to perform the role of DF\
    \ for a given B-VID\n   is responsible for withdrawing the associated information\
    \ from BGP\n   and ISIS-SPB, respectively.  The actual information exchanged is\n\
    \   outlined in the following sections.\n"

    \ accordingly.  NLRI creation/modification\n   will ensure:\n   -  the Route Distinguisher\

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Security issues associated with incorrect interconnection\
    \ of customer\n   LANs cannot be directly addressed by implementations of this\n\
    \   document, as it requires misconfiguration in the Shortest Path\n   Bridging\
    \ domains.  The identifiers so administered have global\n   significance to the\
    \ larger system.  They are relayed transparently by\n   EVPN and only policed\
    \ in the SPBM domains.  Therefore, care is\n   required in synchronization of\
    \ identifiers that need to be common for\n   inter-domain operation.\n   There\
    \ are only two identifiers unique to this solution provisioned at\n   an SPBM-PE\
    \ at service turn-up: the route target and the ESI.  The ESI\n   needs to be unique\
    \ and common to all SPBM-PEs connected to a common\n   SPBM network or PBBN, else\
    \ portions of the overall network will not\n   share reachability.  (The EVPN\
    \ will assume that separate networks are\n   interconnected by SPBM.)  Security\
    \ issues exist when SPBM domains are\n   incorrectly cross-connected together\
    \ via EVPN; this will result in\n   black-holing or incorrect delivery of data\
    \ with associated privacy\n   issues.  This error may occur by provisioning the\
    \ incorrect RT value\n   at an SPBM-PE or associating the RT with the wrong interface.\
    \  This\n   error can be avoided by consistency-checking the route target\n  \
    \ provisioning at SPBM-PEs when performing service additions and/or\n   changes.\n\
    \   The behavior that is potentially most destructive to the overall\n   system\
    \ is frequent changes to the DF elections for a given ESI.  This\n   would occur\
    \ if the SPBM-PEs continuously had their links go up and\n   down in a such a\
    \ way that the SPBM-PE was being severed from and\n   reconnected to either the\
    \ IP/MPLS network or the attached SPBM\n   network.  Either of these scenarios\
    \ would result in significant\n   control-plane traffic as DF associated information\
    \ was advertised and\n   withdrawn from both the SPBM and BGP control planes.\
    \  Dual-homing of\n   SPBM-PEs on both networks would minimize the likelihood\
    \ of this\n   scenario occurring.\n   The issues associated with securing the\
    \ BGP control plane\n   (independent of this particular memo) are reflected in\
    \ the Security\n   Considerations section of [RFC4761].\n"
