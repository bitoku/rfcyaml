Abstract Some IETF protocols make use of Ethernet frame formats and IEEE 802 parameters.
This document discusses some use of such parameters in IETF protocols and specifies IANA considerations for allocation of code points under the IANA OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier).
Some IETF protocols use Ethernet or other [IEEE]
802 related communication frame formats and parameters [IEEE802].
These include MAC (Media Access Control) identifiers and protocol identifiers.
This document specifies IANA considerations for the allocation of code points under the IANA OUI.
It also discusses some other IETF use of IEEE 802 code points.
[RFC5226] is incorporated herein except where there are contrary provisions in this document.
Notations Used in This Document
This document uses hexadecimal notation.
that is, 8 bit byte) is represented by two hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer.
Successive octets are separated by a hyphen.
This document consistently uses IETF bit ordering although the physical order of bit transmission within an octet on an IEEE [802.3] link is from the lowest order bit to the highest order bit (i.e., the reverse of the IETF's ordering).
In this document: "IAB" stands for Individual Address Block, not for Internet Architecture Board; "MAC" stands for Media Access Control, not for Message Authentication Code; and "OUI" stands for Organizationally Unique Identifier. "
For example, 2  24 is two to the twenty fourth power.
The IEEE Registration Authority Originally the responsibility of Xerox Corporation, the registration authority for Ethernet parameters is now the IEEE Registration Authority, available on the web at:
Anyone may apply to that Authority for parameters.
They may impose fees or other requirements but commonly waive fees for applications from standards development organizations.
A list of some allocated OUIs and IABs and their holders is downloadable from the IEEE Registration Authority site.
00 5E has been allocated to IANA.
Ethernet Identifier Parameters Section 2.1 discusses EUI 48
MAC identifiers, their relationship to OUIs and IABs, and allocations under the IANA OUI.
Section 2.2 extends this to EUI 64 identifiers.
Section 2.3 discusses other IETF MAC identifier use not under the IANA OUI.
48 Bit MAC Identifiers and OUIs
48 bit MAC "addresses" are the most commonly used Ethernet interface identifiers.
Those that are globally unique are also called EUI 48 identifiers.
An EUI 48 is structured into an initial 3 octet OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) and an additional 3 octets assigned by the OUI holder.
For organizations not requiring 3 octets' worth of identifiers, the IEEE allocates IABs (Individual Address Blocks)
instead, where the first 4 1/2 octets (36 bits) are assigned, giving the holder of the IAB 1 1/2 octets (12 bits) they can control.
The IEEE describes its assignment procedures and policies for IEEE 802 related identifiers in [802 O&A].
Two bits within the initial 3 octets of an EUI 48 have special significance: the Group bit (01 00 00) and the Local bit (02 00 00).
OUIs and IABs are allocated with the Local bit zero and the Group bit unspecified.
Multicast identifiers may be constructed by turning on the Group bit, and unicast identifiers constructed by leaving the Group bit zero.
For globally unique EUI 48 identifiers allocated by an OUI or IAB owner, the Local bit is zero.
If the Local bit is a one, the identifier is considered by IEEE 802 to be a local identifier under the control of the local network administrator.
If the Local bit is on, the holder of an OUI (or IAB) has no special authority over 48 bit
whose first 3 (or 4 1/2) octets correspond to their OUI (or IAB).
EUI 48 Allocations under the IANA
00 5E has been assigned to IANA as stated in Section 1.2.1 above.
This includes 2  24 EUI 48 multicast identifiers from 01 00 5E 00 00 00 to 01 00 5E FF FF FF and 2  24 EUI 48 unicast identifiers from 00 00 5E 00 00 00 to 00 00 5E FF FF FF.
Of these EUI 48 identifiers, the following allocations have been made thus far:  The 2  23 multicast identifiers from 01 00 5E 00 00 00 through 01
00 5E 7F FF FF have been allocated for IPv4 multicast [RFC1112].
The 2  20 multicast identifiers from 01 00 5E 80 00 00
through 01 00 5E 8F FF FF have been allocated for MPLS multicast [RFC5332].
The 2  8 unicast identifiers from 00 00 5E 00 00 00 through 00 00
5E 00 00 FF are reserved and require IESG Ratification for allocation (see Section 5.1).
The 2  8 unicast identifiers from 00 00 5E 00
01 00 through 00 00
5E 00 01 FF have been allocated for the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)
EUI 48 IANA Allocation Considerations EUI 48 allocations under the current or a future IANA OUI
(see Section 5.2) must meet the following requirements:  must be for standards purposes (either for an IETF Standard or other standard related to IETF work),  must be for a block of a power of two identifiers starting at a boundary that is an equal or greater power of two, including the allocation of one
(2  0) identifier,  must not be used to evade the requirement for vendors to obtain their own block of identifiers from the IEEE, and  must be documented in an Internet Draft or RFC.
In addition, approval must be obtained as follows (see the procedure in Section 5.1):
EUI 48 identifiers require Expert Review.
Large allocations of 131072 (2  17) or more EUI 48 identifiers require IESG Ratification (see Section 5.1).
To simplify record keeping, all future allocations of 256
(2  8) or fewer identifiers shall have the Group bit unspecified, that is, shall be allocations of parallel equal size blocks of multicast and unicast identifiers, even if one of these two types is not needed for the proposed use.
The only exception is that requests for unicast
only identifier blocks of any size may be allocated out of the remaining identifiers in the large unicast range from 00 00 5E 00 02 00 to 00 00 5E 8F FF FF.
64 Bit MAC Identifiers IEEE also defines a system of 64 bit MAC identifiers including EUI 64s.
Uptake of these "MAC 64" identifiers has been limited.
They are currently used in constructing some IPv6 Interface Identifiers as described below and by the following IEEE standards:  IEEE 1394 (also known as FireWire and i.
Adding a 5 octet (40 bit) extension to a 3 octet (24 bit)
OUI forms an EUI 64 identifier under that OUI.
As with EUI 48 identifiers, the OUI has the same Group/unicast and Local/Global bits.
The discussion below is almost entirely in terms of the "Modified" form of EUI 64 identifiers; however, anyone allocated such an identifier also has the unmodified form and may use it as a MAC identifier on any link that uses such 64 bit identifiers for interfaces.
IPv6 Use of Modified EUI
64 Identifiers MAC 64 identifiers are used to form the lower 64 bits of some IPv6 addresses (Section 2.5.1 and Appendix A of [RFC4291] and Appendix A of [RFC5214]).
When so used, the MAC 64 is modified by inverting the Local/Global bit to form an IETF "Modified EUI 64 identifier".
Below is an illustration of a Modified EUI 64 identifier under the IANA OUI,
where aa bb cc dd ee is the extension.
The first octet is shown as 02 rather than 00 because, in Modified EUI 64 identifiers, the sense of the Local/Global bit is inverted compared with EUI 48 identifiers.
It is the globally unique values (universal scope) that have the 02 bit on in the first octet, while those with this bit off are locally assigned and out of scope for global allocation.
The Local/Global bit was inverted to make it easier for network operators to type in local scope identifiers.
Thus, such Modified EUI 64 identifiers as 1, 2, etc.
(ignoring leading zeros), are local.
Without the modification, they would have to be 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 01, 02 00 00 00 00
02, etc., to be local.
As with MAC 48 identifiers, the 01 bit on in the first octet indicates a group identifier.
When the first two octets of the extension of a Modified EUI 64 identifier are FF FE, the remainder of the extension is a 24 bit value as assigned by the OUI owner for an EUI 48.
For example: 02 00 5E FF FE
yy yy yy or 03 00
where yy yy yy is the portion (of an EUI 48 global unicast or multicast identifier) that is assigned by the OUI owner (IANA in this case).
Thus, any holder of one or more EUI 48 identifiers under the IANA OUI also has an equal number of Modified EUI 64 identifiers that can be formed by inserting FF FE in the middle of their EUI 48 identifiers and inverting the Local/Global bit.
(Note: [EUI 64] defines FF FF as the bits to be inserted to create an IEEE EUI 64 identifier from a MAC 48 identifier.
That document says the FF FE value is used when starting with an EUI 48 identifier.
The IETF uses only FF FE to create Modified EUI 64 identifiers from 48 bit Ethernet station identifiers regardless of whether they are EUI 48 or MAC 48 local identifiers.
EUI 48 and local MAC 48 identifiers are syntactically equivalent, and this doesn't cause any problems in practice.)
In addition, certain Modified EUI 64 identifiers under the IANA OUI are reserved for holders of IPv4 addresses as follows: 02 00 5E FE
xx xx xx xx where xx xx xx xx is a 32 bit IPv4 address.
For Modified EUI 64 identifiers based on an IPv4 address, the Local/Global bit should be set to correspond to whether the IPv4 address is local or global.
(Keep in mind that the sense of the Modified EUI 64 identifier Local/Global bit is reversed from that in (unmodified) MAC 64 identifiers.)
EUI 64 IANA Allocation Considerations
The following table shows which Modified EUI 64 identifiers under the IANA OUI are reserved, used, or available as indicated.
02 00 5E 00 00 00 00 00 to 02 00 5E 0F FF FF FF FF reserved 02 00 5E 10 00 00 00 00 to 02 00 5E EF FF FF FF FF available for allocation 02 00 5E F0 00 00 00 00
to 02 00 5E FD FF FF FF FF reserved 02 00 5E FE 00 00 00 00 to 02 00 5E FE FF FF FF FF used by IPv4 address holders as described above 02 00 5E FF 00 00 00 00 to 02 00 5E FF FD FF FF FF reserved 02 00 5E FF FE 00 00 00 to 02 00 5E FF FE FF FF FF used by holders of EUI 48 identifiers under the IANA OUI as described above 02 00 5E FF FF 00 00 00 to 02 00 5E FF FF FF FF FF reserved The reserved identifiers above require IESG Ratification (see Section 5.1) for allocation.
IANA EUI 64 identifier allocations under the IANA OUI must meet the following requirements:  must be for standards purposes (either for an IETF Standard or other standard related to IETF work),  must be for a block of a power of two identifiers starting at a boundary which is an equal or greater power of two, including the allocation of one (2  0) identifier,  must not be used to evade the requirement for vendors to obtain their own block of identifiers from the IEEE, and  must be documented in an Internet Draft or RFC.
In addition, approval must be obtained as follows (see the procedure in Section 5.1):
EUI 64 identifiers require Expert Review.
Allocations of any size, including 536870912 (2  29) or more EUI 64 identifiers, may be made with IESG Ratification (see Section 5.1).
To simplify record keeping, all allocations of 65536 (2  16) or less EUI 64 identifiers shall have the Group bit unspecified, that is, shall be allocations of parallel equal size blocks of multicast and unicast identifiers, even if one of these two types is not needed for the proposed use.
Other MAC 48 Identifiers Used by IETF
There are two other blocks of MAC 48 identifiers that are used by the IETF as described below.
All MAC 48 multicast identifiers prefixed "33 33" (that is, the 2  32 multicast MAC identifiers in the range from 33 33 00 00 00 00 to 33 33 FF FF FF FF) are used by the IETF for global IPv6 multicast [RFC2464].
In all these identifiers, the Group bit (the bottom bit of the first octet) is on, as is required to work properly with existing hardware as a multicast identifier.
They also have the Local bit on and are used for this purpose in IPv6 networks.
It was the custom during IPv6 design to use "3" for unknown or example values, and 3333 Coyote Hill Road, Palo Alto, California, is the address of PARC
(Palo Alto Research Center, formerly "Xerox PARC").
Ethernet was originally specified by Digital Equipment Corporation, Intel Corporation, and Xerox Corporation.
Ethernet protocol has sometimes been known as "DIX" Ethernet from the first letters of the names of these companies.)
The 'CF Series' The Informational [RFC2153] declared the 3 octet values from CF 00 00 through CF FF FF to be OUIs available for allocation by IANA to software vendors for use in PPP [RFC1661] or for other uses where vendors do not otherwise need an IEEE assigned OUI.
It should be noted that, when used as MAC 48 prefixes, these values have the Local and Group bits on, while all IEEE allocated OUIs have those bits off.
The Group bit is meaningless in PPP.
To quote [RFC2153]: "The 'CF0000' series was arbitrarily chosen to match the PPP NLPID 'CF', as a matter of mnemonic convenience.
CF 00 00 is reserved, and IANA lists multicast identifier CF 00 00 00 00 00 as used for Ethernet loopback tests.
In over a decade of availability, only a handful of values in the 'CF Series' have been allocated.
(See http://www.iana.org under both Ethernet Parameters and PPP Parameters.)
The IANA Considerations in [RFC2153] are updated as follows (no technical changes are made): Use of these identifiers based on IANA allocation is deprecated.
IANA is directed not to allocate any further values in the 'CF Series'.
Ethernet Protocol Parameters Ethernet protocol parameters provide a means of indicating the contents of a frame   for example, that its contents are IPv4 or IPv6.
The concept has been extended to labeling by "tags".
A tag in this sense is a prefix whose type is identified by an Ethertype that is then followed by either another tag, an Ethertype, or an LSAP protocol indicator for the "main" body of the frame, as described below.
Traditionally in the [802 O&A] world, tags are fixed length and do not include any encoding of their own length.
Thus, anything that is processing a frame cannot, in general, safely process anything in the frame past an Ethertype it does not understand.
An example is the C tag (formerly the Q tag)
It provides customer VLAN and priority information for a frame.
There are two types of protocol identifier parameters that can occur in Ethernet frames after the initial MAC 48 destination and source identifiers:
These are 16 bit identifiers appearing as the initial two octets after the MAC destination and source (or after a tag) which, when considered as an unsigned integer, are equal to or larger than 0x0600.
These are 8 bit protocol identifiers that occur in pairs immediately after an initial 16 bit (two octet) remaining frame length, which is in turn after the MAC destination and source (or after a tag).
Such a length must, when considered as an unsigned integer, be less than 0x5DC
or it could be mistaken as an Ethertype.
LSAPs (Link Layer Subnet Access Points) occur in pairs where one is intended to indicate the source protocol handler and one the destination protocol handler; however, use cases where the two are different have been relatively rare.
Neither Ethertypes nor LSAPs are allocated by IANA; instead, they are allocated by the IEEE Registration Authority (see Section 1.2 above and the Ethertype Annex below).
However, both LSAPs and Ethertypes have extension mechanisms so that they can be used with five octet Ethernet protocol identifiers under an OUI, including those allocated by IANA under the IANA OUI.
When using the IEEE 802 LLC format (SNAP) [802 O&A] for a frame, an OUI based protocol identifier can be expressed as follows:
xx xx AA AA 03
zz zz where xx xx is the frame length and, as above, must be small enough not to be confused with an Ethertype; "AA" is the LSAP that indicates this use and is sometimes referred to as the SNAP SAP; "03" is the LLC control octet indicating datagram service;
yy yy yy is an OUI; and zz zz is a protocol number, under that OUI, allocated by the OUI owner.
The odd five octet length for such OUI based protocol identifiers was chosen so that, with the LLC control octet ("03"), the result is 16 bit aligned.
When using an Ethertype to indicate the main type for a frame body, the special "OUI Extended Ethertype" 88 B7 is available.
Using this Ethertype, a frame body can begin with 88 B7 yy yy
yy zz zz where yy yy yy and zz zz have the same meaning as in the SNAP format described above.
It is also possible, within the SNAP format, to use an arbitrary Ethertype.
Putting the Ethertype as the zz zz field after an all zeros OUI (00 00 00) does this.
It looks like xx xx AA AA 03 00 00 00
zz where zz zz is the Ethertype.
(Note that, at this point, the 802 protocol syntax facilities are sufficiently powerful that they could be chained indefinitely.
Whether support for such chaining is generally required is not clear, but [802 O&A] requires support for xx xx AA AA 03 00 00 00 88 B7 yy yy yy zz zz even though this could be more efficiently expressed by simply pinching out the "00 00 00 88 B7" in the middle.)
As well as labeling frame contents, 802 Protocol types appear within NBMA (Non Broadcast Multi Access)
Next Hop Resolution Protocol [RFC2332] messages.
Such messages have provisions for both two octet Ethertypes and OUI based protocol types.
3.1.  Ethernet Protocol Allocation under the IANA OUI Two octet protocol numbers under the IANA OUI are available, as in xx xx AA AA 03 00 00
A number of such allocations have been made out of the 2  16 protocol numbers available from 00 00 5E 00 00 to 00 00 5E FF FF (see [IANA]).
The extreme values of this range, 00 00 5E 00 00 and 00 00 5E FF FF, are reserved and require IESG Ratification for allocation (see Section 5.1).
New allocations of SNAP SAP protocol (zz zz) numbers under the IANA OUI must meet the following requirements:  the allocation must be for standards use (either for an IETF Standard or other standard related to IETF work),  it must be documented in an Internet Draft or RFC, and  such protocol numbers are not to be allocated for any protocol that has an Ethertype (because that can be expressed by putting an all zeros "OUI" before the Ethertype as described above).
In addition, the Expert Review (or IESG Ratification for the two reserved values) must be obtained using the procedure specified in Section 5.1. 4.
Some IEEE 802 and other protocols provide for parameters based on an OUI beyond those discussed above.
Such parameters most commonly consist of an OUI plus one octet of additional value.
They are usually called "vendor specific" parameters, although "organization specific" might be more accurate.
They would look like yy yy yy zz where yy yy yy is the OUI and zz is the additional specifier.
An example is the Cipher Suite Selector in IEEE 802.11 ([802.11], page 125).
Values may be allocated under the IANA OUI for such other OUI based parameter usage by Expert Review except that, for each use, the additional specifier values consisting of all zero bits and all one bits (0x00 and 0xFF for a one octet specifier) are reserved and require IESG Ratification (see Section 5.1) for allocation.
The allocations must be for standards use (either for an IETF Standard or other standard related to IETF work) and be documented in an Internet Draft or RFC.
The first time a value is allocated for a particular parameter of this type, an IANA registry will be created to contain that allocation and any subsequent allocations of values for that parameter under the IANA OUI.
The Expert will specify the name of the registry.
(If a different policy from that above is required for such a parameter, a BCP or Standards Track RFC must be adopted updating this BCP and specifying the new policy and parameter.)
The entirety of this document concerns IANA Considerations for the allocation of Ethernet parameters in connection with the IANA OUI and related matters.
Specifically: Section 1.2.1 provides information on the IANA assigned OUI.
current EUI 48 assignments under this OUI.
Section 2.1.2 specifies IANA considerations for EUI 48 assignments.
Section 2.2.2 specifies IANA considerations for EUI 64 assignments.
Section 3.1 provides a pointer to current protocol identifier assignments under the IANA OUI, and specifies IANA considerations for protocol identifier assignments.
Section 4 briefly provides IANA considerations relating to OUI  based miscellaneous allocations.
Expert Review and IESG Ratification
This section specifies the procedure for Expert Review and IESG Ratification of MAC, protocol, and other IANA OUI based identifiers.
The Expert(s) referred to in this document shall consist of one or more persons appointed by and serving at the pleasure of the IESG.
The procedure described for Expert Review allocations in this document is fully consistent with the IANA Expert Review policy described in Section 4.1 of [RFC5226].
While finite, the universe of code points from which Expert judged allocations will be made is felt to be large enough that the requirements given in this document and the Experts' good judgment are sufficient guidance.
The idea is for the Expert to provide a light sanity check for small allocations of EUI identifiers with increased scrutiny by the Expert for medium sized allocations of EUI identifiers, and allocations of protocol identifiers and other IANA OUI based parameters.
However, it can make sense to allocate very large portions of the MAC identifier code point space.
(Note that existing allocations include one for 1/2 of the entire multicast code point space and one for 1/16 of the multicast code point space.)
In those cases, and in cases of the allocation of "reserved" values, IESG Ratification of an Expert Review approval recommendation is required as described below.
The procedure is as follows:
The applicant always completes the appropriate Template from the Template Annex below and sends it to IANA
IANA always sends the Template to an appointed Expert.
If the Expert recuses themselves or is non responsive, IANA may choose an alternative appointed Expert or, if none are available, will contact the IESG.
If the allocation is based on Expert Review: If IANA receives a disapproval from an Expert selected to review an application Template, the application will be denied.
If IANA receives approval and code points are available, IANA will make the requested allocation.
If the allocation is based on IESG Ratification, the procedure starts with the first two steps above for Expert Review.
If the Expert disapproves the application, they simply inform IANA; however, if the Expert believes the application should be approved, or is uncertain and believes that the circumstances warrant the attention of the IESG, the Expert will inform IANA about their advice and IANA will forward the application, together with the reasons for approval or uncertainty, to the IESG.
The IESG must decide whether the allocation will be granted.
This can be accomplished by a management item in an IESG telechat as done for other types of requests.
If the IESG decides not to ratify a favorable opinion by the Expert or decides against an application where the Expert is uncertain, the application is denied, otherwise it is granted.
The IESG will communicate its decision to the Expert and to IANA.
Informational IANA Web Page Material IANA also maintains an informational listing on its web site concerning Ethertypes, OUIs, and multicast addresses allocated under OUIs other than the IANA OUI.
IANA shall update that list when changes are provided by the Expert.
When the available space for either multicast or unicast EUI 48 identifiers under OUI 00 00 5E have been 90% or more exhausted, IANA should request an additional OUI from the IEEE Registration Authority (see Section 1.2) for further IANA allocation use.
