- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Current versions of the Internet Protocol make an implicit\
    \ assumption\n   that a node's point of attachment remains fixed.  Datagrams are\
    \ sent\n   to a node based on the location information contained in the node's\n\
    \   IP address.\n   If a node moves while keeping its IP address unchanged, its\
    \ IP\n   network number will not reflect its new point of attachment.  The\n \
    \  routing protocols will not be able to route datagrams to it\n   correctly.\n\
    \   A number of considerations arise for routing these datagrams to a\n   Mobile\
    \ Node.\n"
- title: 2.  Addressing
  contents:
  - "2.  Addressing\n   Each Mobile Node must have at least one Home-Address which\
    \ identifies\n   it to other nodes.  This Home-Address must be globally unique.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Ownership
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Ownership\n   The presence of ownership information in the Home-Address\
    \ would be\n   beneficial.  A Mobile Node will be assigned a Home-Address by the\n\
    \   organization that owns the machine, and will be able to use that\n   Home-Address\
    \ regardless of the current point of attachment.\n   The ownership information\
    \ must be organized in such a fashion to\n   facilitate \"inverse\" lookup in\
    \ the Domain Name Service, and other\n   future services.\n   Ownership information\
    \ could be used by other nodes to ascertain the\n   current topological location\
    \ of the Mobile Node.\n   Ownership information could also be used for generation\
    \ of accounting\n   records.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Topology
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Topology\n   There is no requirement that the Home-Address contain topological\n\
    \   information.  Indeed, by the very nature of mobility, any such\n   topological\
    \ information is irrelevant.\n   Topological information in the Home-Address must\
    \ not hinder mobility,\n   whether by prevention of relocation, or by wasting\
    \ bandwidth or\n   processing efficiency.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Manufacturer
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Manufacturer\n   There is no requirement that the Home-Address contain\
    \ manufacturer\n   information.\n   Manufacturer information in the Home-Address\
    \ must not hinder\n   mobility, whether by prevention of relocation, or by wasting\n\
    \   bandwidth or processing efficiency.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Numbering
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Numbering\n   The number of mobile nodes is expected to be constrained\
    \ by the\n   population of users within the lifetime of the IPng protocol.  The\n\
    \   maximum world-wide sustainable population is estimated as 16e9,\n   although\
    \ during the lifetime of IPng the population is not expected\n   to exceed 8e9.\n\
    \   Each user is assumed to be mobile, and to have a maximum combined\n   personal\
    \ mobile and home network(s) on the order of 4e3 nodes.\n   The expectation is\
    \ that only 46 bits will be needed to densely number\n   all mobile and home nodes.\n\
    \   The size of addressing elements is also constrained by bandwidth\n   efficiency\
    \ and processing efficiency, as described later.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Configuration
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Configuration\n   Since the typical user would be unlikely to be aware\
    \ of or willing\n   and able to maintain 4e3 nodes, the assignment of Home-Addresses\
    \ must\n   be automatically configurable.  Registration of the nodes must be\n\
    \   dynamic and transparent to the user, both at home and away from home.\n"
- title: 3.  Communication
  contents:
  - "3.  Communication\n   A Mobile Node must continue to be capable of communicating\
    \ directly\n   with other nodes which do not implement mobility functions.\n \
    \  No protocol enhancements are required in hosts or routers that are\n   not\
    \ serving any of the mobility functions.  Similarly, no additional\n   protocols\
    \ are needed by a router (that is not acting as a Home Agent\n   or a Foreign\
    \ Agent) to route datagrams to or from a Mobile Node.\n   A Mobile Node using\
    \ its Home-Address must be able to communicate with\n   other nodes after having\
    \ been disconnected from the Internet, and\n   then reconnected at a different\
    \ point of attachment.\n   A Mobile Node using its Home-Address must be able to\
    \ communicate with\n   other nodes while roaming between different points of attachment,\n\
    \   without loss of transport connections.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Topological Changes
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Topological Changes\n   In order that transport connections be maintained\
    \ while roaming,\n   topological changes must not affect transport connections.\n\
    \   For correspondent nodes which do not implement mobility functions,\n   topological\
    \ changes should not be communicated to the correspondent.\n   For correspondent\
    \ nodes which implement mobility functions, the\n   correspondent should be capable\
    \ of determining topological changes.\n   Topological change information must\
    \ be capable of insertion and\n   removal by routers in the datagram path, as\
    \ well as by the\n   correspondent and Mobile Node.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Routing Updates
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Routing Updates\n   Mobile Nodes are expected to be able to change their\
    \ point of\n   attachment no more frequently than once per second.\n   Changes\
    \ in topology which occur more frequently must be handled at\n   the link layer\
    \ transparently to the internetwork layer.  It is\n   further noted that engineering\
    \ margins may require the link layer to\n   handle all changes at a frequency\
    \ in the neighborhood of 10 seconds.\n   Changes in topology which occur less\
    \ frequently must be immediately\n   reflected in the mobility updates.  This\
    \ may preclude the use of the\n   Domain Name Service as the repository of mobility\
    \ topological\n   information.\n   It must be noted that global routing updates\
    \ do not operate at this\n   frequency.  As old topological information may be\
    \ obsoleted faster\n   than global routing updates, access to the repository of\
    \ mobility\n   topological information must be independent of prior topological\n\
    \   information.\n   The mobility specific repository should use ownership information\
    \ in\n   the Home-Address for access to the repository.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Path Optimization
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Path Optimization\n   Optimization of the path from a correspondent to\
    \ a mobile node is not\n   required.  However, such optimization is desirable.\n\
    \   For correspondent nodes which implement mobility functions, the\n   correspondent\
    \ should be capable of determining the optimal path.\n   The optimization mechanism\
    \ is also constrained by security, bandwidth\n   efficiency and processing efficiency,\
    \ as described later.\n"
- title: 3.4.  At Home
  contents:
  - "3.4.  At Home\n   Mobile Nodes do not require special \"virtual\" home network\
    \ addresses.\n   The assumption that extra addresses or multiple routers are available\n\
    \   is unwarranted in small networks.\n   Mobile Nodes must operate without special\
    \ assistance from routers in\n   order to communicate directly with other nodes\
    \ on the home subnetwork\n   link.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Away From Home
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Away From Home\n   When a router is present, and the correspondent does\
    \ not implement\n   mobility functions, the router must be capable of redirecting\
    \ the\n   correspondent to communicate directly with the Mobile Node.\n   When\
    \ no router is present, Mobile Nodes must be capable of\n   communicating directly\
    \ with other nodes on the same link.\n   Mobility must not create an environment\
    \ which is less secure than the\n   current Internet.\n   Changes in topology\
    \ must not affect internode security mechanisms.\n"

- title: 4.1.  Authentication
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Authentication\n   Mobility registration messages must be authenticated\
    \ between the home\n   topological repository and Mobile Node.\n   When the correspondent\
    \ implements mobility functions, redirection or\n   path optimization must be\
    \ authenticated between the correspondent and\n   Mobile Node.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.  Anonymity\n   The capability to attach to a foreign administrative domain\
    \ without\n   the awareness of the foreign administration is not prohibited.\n\

    \ attachment.\n"

  - "4.3.  Location Privacy\n   The capability to attach to a foreign administrative\
    \ domain without\n   the awareness of correspondents is not prohibited.  However,\
    \ any\n   mobility mechanism must provide the ability for the home\n   administration\
    \ to trace the current path to the point of attachment.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Content Privacy
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Content Privacy\n   Security mechanisms which provide content privacy must\
    \ not obscure or\n   have a dependency on the topological location of Mobile Nodes.\n"
- title: 5.  Bandwidth
  contents:
  - "5.  Bandwidth\n   Mobility must operate in the current link environment, and\
    \ must not\n   be dependent on bandwidth improvements.  The Mobile Node's directly\n\
    \   attached link is likely to be bandwidth limited.\n   In particular, radio\
    \ frequency spectrum is already a scarce\n   commodity.  Higher bandwidth links\
    \ are likely to continue to be\n   scarce in the mobile environment.\n   Current\
    \ applications of mobility using radio links include HF links\n   which are subject\
    \ to serious fading and noise constraints, VHF and\n   UHF line of sight radio\
    \ between ships or field sites, and UHF\n   Satellite Communications links.\n\
    \   The HF radio bandwidth is fixed at 1200 or 2400 bps by international\n   treaty,\
    \ statute, and custom, and is not likely to change.\n   The European standard\
    \ for cellular radio is 2400 bps GSM.\n   The most prevalent deployed analog cellular\
    \ and land-line modulation\n   used by mobile nodes is 2400 bps.\n   Current digital\
    \ cellular deployment is 19,200 bps CDPD shared among\n   many users.  At early\
    \ installations, under light loads, effective FTP\n   throughput has been observed\
    \ as low as 200 bps.\n   Future digital cellular deployment is 9,600 and 14,400\
    \ bps CDMA,\n   which is shared between voice and data on a per user basis.\n\
    \   Effective FTP throughput has been measured as low as 7,200 bps.\n   Future\
    \ Personal Communications Services (PCS) will also have\n   relatively little\
    \ bandwidth.  In industrialized nations, the\n   bandwidth available to each user\
    \ is constrained by the density of\n   deployment, and is commensurate with planned\
    \ digital cellular\n   deployment.\n   It appears likely that satellite-based\
    \ PCS will be widely deployed\n   for basic telephony communications in many newly-industrialized\
    \ and\n   lesser-developed countries.  There is already significant PCS\n   interest\
    \ in East and SouthEast Asia, India, and South America.\n   Van Jacobson header\
    \ prediction is widely used, and essential to\n   making the use of such links\
    \ viable.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Administrative Messages
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Administrative Messages\n   The number of administrative mobility messages\
    \ sent or received by\n   the Mobile Node must be limited to as few as possible.\
    \  In order to\n   meet the frequency requirement of changing point of attachment\
    \ once\n   per second, registration of changes must not require more than a\n\
    \   single request and reply.\n   The size of administrative mobility messages\
    \ must be kept as short as\n   possible.  In order to meet the frequency requirement\
    \ of changing\n   point of attachment once per second, the registration messages\
    \ must\n   not total more than 120 bytes for a complete transaction, including\n\
    \   link and internet headers.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Response Time
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Response Time\n   For most mobile links in current use, the typical TCP/IPv4\
    \ datagram\n   overhead of 40 bytes is too large to maintain an acceptable typing\n\
    \   response of 200 milliseconds round trip time.\n   Therefore, the criteria\
    \ for IPng mobility is that the response time\n   not be perceptably worse than\
    \ IPv4.\n   This allows no more than 6 bytes of additional overhead per datagram\n\
    \   to be added by IPng.\n      This was a primary concern in the design of mobility\
    \ forwarding\n      headers.  Larger headers were rejected outright, and negotiation\n\
    \      is provided for smaller headers than the default method.\n      Topological\
    \ headers are removed by the Foreign Agent prior to\n      datagram transmission\
    \ over the slower link to the Mobile Node,\n      which also aids header prediction,\
    \ as described below.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Header Prediction
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Header Prediction\n   Header prediction can be useful in reducing bandwidth\
    \ usage on\n   multiple related datagrams.  It requires a point-to-point peer\n\
    \   relationship between nodes, so that a header history can be\n   maintained\
    \ between the peers.\n   Header prediction is less effective in mobile environments,\
    \ as the\n   header history is lost each time a Mobile Node changes its point\
    \ of\n   attachment.  The new Foreign Agent will not have the same history as\n\
    \   the previous Agent.\n   In order for header prediction to operate successfully,\
    \ changing\n   topological information must be removed from datagram overhead\
    \ prior\n   to transmission of the datagram on any final hop's directly attached\n\
    \   link.  This applies to both the Mobile Node peering with a Foreign\n   Agent,\
    \ and also the final link to a Correspondent.  Otherwise, header\n   prediction\
    \ cannot be relied upon to improve bandwidth utilization on\n   low-speed Mobile\
    \ and Correspondent links.\n   Since the changing topological information cannot\
    \ be removed in the\n   forwarding path of the datagram, header prediction will\
    \ also be\n   affected at any other pair of routers in the datagram path.  Each\n\
    \   time that a Mobile Node moves, the topological portion of the header\n   will\
    \ change, and header history used at those routers will be\n   updated.  Unless\
    \ topological information is limited to as few headers\n   as possible, this may\
    \ render header prediction ineffective as more\n   Mobile Nodes are deployed.\n"
- title: 6.  Processing
  contents:
  - "6.  Processing\n   Mobility must operate in the current processor environment,\
    \ and must\n   not be dependent on hardware improvements.\n   Common hardware\
    \ implementations of Mobile Nodes include lower speed\n   processors, and highly\
    \ integrated components.  These are not readily\n   upgradable.\n   The most prevalent\
    \ mobile platform is a low speed i86, i286 or i386.\n   The most common ASIC processor\
    \ is a low speed i186.\n"
- title: 6.1.  Fixed Location
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Fixed Location\n   The processing limitations require that datagram header\
    \ fields which\n   are frequently examined by Mobile Nodes, or used for datagram\n\
    \   forwarding to or from Mobile Nodes, are in a fixed location and do\n   not\
    \ require lengths and offsets.\n      Varied number of fields was explicitly rejected\
    \ in the design of\n      mobility registration and forwarding headers.\n"
