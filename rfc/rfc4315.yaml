  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The UIDPLUS extension of the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)\n\
    \   provides a set of features intended to reduce the amount of time and\n   resources\
    \ used by some client operations.  The features in UIDPLUS\n   are primarily intended\
    \ for disconnected-use clients.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction and Overview
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction and Overview\n   The UIDPLUS extension is present in any IMAP\
    \ server implementation\n   that returns \"UIDPLUS\" as one of the supported capabilities\
    \ to the\n   CAPABILITY command.\n   The UIDPLUS extension defines an additional\
    \ command.  In addition,\n   this document recommends new status response codes\
    \ in IMAP that\n   SHOULD be returned by all server implementations, regardless\
    \ of\n   whether or not the UIDPLUS extension is implemented.\n   The added facilities\
    \ of the features in UIDPLUS are optimizations;\n   clients can provide equivalent\
    \ functionality, albeit less\n   efficiently, by using facilities in the base\
    \ protocol.\n"

    \ lines sent by the client and\n   server, respectively.\n   The key words \"\
    MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\",\
    \ \"SHOULD NOT\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to\n   be interpreted\
    \ as described in [KEYWORDS].\n   A \"UID set\" is similar to the [IMAP] sequence\
    \ set; however, the \"*\"\n   value for a sequence number is not permitted.\n"

  - "2.  Additional Commands\n   The following command definition is an extension\
    \ to [IMAP] section\n   6.4.\n"
- title: 2.1.  UID EXPUNGE Command
  contents:
  - "2.1.  UID EXPUNGE Command\n   Arguments:  sequence set\n   Data:       untagged\
    \ responses: EXPUNGE\n   Result:     OK - expunge completed\n               NO\
    \ - expunge failure (e.g., permission denied)\n               BAD - command unknown\
    \ or arguments invalid\n      The UID EXPUNGE command permanently removes all\
    \ messages that both\n      have the \\Deleted flag set and have a UID that is\
    \ included in the\n      specified sequence set from the currently selected mailbox.\
    \  If a\n      message either does not have the \\Deleted flag set or has a UID\n\
    \      that is not included in the specified sequence set, it is not\n      affected.\n\
    \      This command is particularly useful for disconnected use clients.\n   \
    \   By using UID EXPUNGE instead of EXPUNGE when resynchronizing with\n      the\
    \ server, the client can ensure that it does not inadvertantly\n      remove any\
    \ messages that have been marked as \\Deleted by other\n      clients between\
    \ the time that the client was last connected and\n      the time the client resynchronizes.\n\
    \      If the server does not support the UIDPLUS capability, the client\n   \
    \   should fall back to using the STORE command to temporarily remove\n      the\
    \ \\Deleted flag from messages it does not want to remove, then\n      issuing\
    \ the EXPUNGE command.  Finally, the client should use the\n      STORE command\
    \ to restore the \\Deleted flag on the messages in\n      which it was temporarily\
    \ removed.\n      Alternatively, the client may fall back to using just the EXPUNGE\n\
    \      command, risking the unintended removal of some messages.\n   Example:\
    \    C: A003 UID EXPUNGE 3000:3002\n               S: * 3 EXPUNGE\n          \
    \     S: * 3 EXPUNGE\n               S: * 3 EXPUNGE\n               S: A003 OK\
    \ UID EXPUNGE completed\n"
- title: 3.  Additional Response Codes
  contents:
  - "3.  Additional Response Codes\n   The following response codes are extensions\
    \ to the response codes\n   defined in [IMAP] section 7.1.  With limited exceptions,\
    \ discussed\n   below, server implementations that advertise the UIDPLUS extension\n\
    \   SHOULD return these response codes.\n   In the case of a mailbox that has\
    \ permissions set so that the client\n   can COPY or APPEND to the mailbox, but\
    \ not SELECT or EXAMINE it, the\n   server SHOULD NOT send an APPENDUID or COPYUID\
    \ response code as it\n   would disclose information about the mailbox.\n   In\
    \ the case of a mailbox that has UIDNOTSTICKY status (as defined\n   below), the\
    \ server MAY omit the APPENDUID or COPYUID response code as\n   it is not meaningful.\n\
    \   If the server does not return the APPENDUID or COPYUID response\n   codes,\
    \ the client can discover this information by selecting the\n   destination mailbox.\
    \  The location of messages placed in the\n   destination mailbox by COPY or APPEND\
    \ can be determined by using\n   FETCH and/or SEARCH commands (e.g., for Message-ID\
    \ or some unique\n   marker placed in the message in an APPEND).\n   APPENDUID\n\
    \      Followed by the UIDVALIDITY of the destination mailbox and the UID\n  \
    \    assigned to the appended message in the destination mailbox,\n      indicates\
    \ that the message has been appended to the destination\n      mailbox with that\
    \ UID.\n      If the server also supports the [MULTIAPPEND] extension, and if\n\
    \      multiple messages were appended in the APPEND command, then the\n     \
    \ second value is a UID set containing the UIDs assigned to the\n      appended\
    \ messages, in the order they were transmitted in the\n      APPEND command. \
    \ This UID set may not contain extraneous UIDs or\n      the symbol \"*\".\n \
    \        Note: the UID set form of the APPENDUID response code MUST NOT\n    \
    \     be used if only a single message was appended.  In particular,\n       \
    \  a server MUST NOT send a range such as 123:123.  This is\n         because\
    \ a client that does not support [MULTIAPPEND] expects\n         only a single\
    \ UID and not a UID set.\n      UIDs are assigned in strictly ascending order\
    \ in the mailbox\n      (refer to [IMAP], section 2.3.1.1) and UID ranges are\
    \ as in\n      [IMAP]; in particular, note that a range of 12:10 is exactly\n\
    \      equivalent to 10:12 and refers to the sequence 10,11,12.\n      This response\
    \ code is returned in a tagged OK response to the\n      APPEND command.\n   COPYUID\n\
    \      Followed by the UIDVALIDITY of the destination mailbox, a UID set\n   \
    \   containing the UIDs of the message(s) in the source mailbox that\n      were\
    \ copied to the destination mailbox and containing the UIDs\n      assigned to\
    \ the copied message(s) in the destination mailbox,\n      indicates that the\
    \ message(s) have been copied to the destination\n      mailbox with the stated\
    \ UID(s).\n      The source UID set is in the order the message(s) were copied;\
    \ the\n      destination UID set corresponds to the source UID set and is in\n\
    \      the same order.  Neither of the UID sets may contain extraneous\n     \
    \ UIDs or the symbol \"*\".\n      UIDs are assigned in strictly ascending order\
    \ in the mailbox\n      (refer to [IMAP], section 2.3.1.1) and UID ranges are\
    \ as in\n      [IMAP]; in particular, note that a range of 12:10 is exactly\n\
    \      equivalent to 10:12 and refers to the sequence 10,11,12.\n      This response\
    \ code is returned in a tagged OK response to the COPY\n      command.\n   UIDNOTSTICKY\n\
    \      The selected mailbox is supported by a mail store that does not\n     \
    \ support persistent UIDs; that is, UIDVALIDITY will be different\n      each\
    \ time the mailbox is selected.  Consequently, APPEND or COPY\n      to this mailbox\
    \ will not return an APPENDUID or COPYUID response\n      code.\n      This response\
    \ code is returned in an untagged NO response to the\n      SELECT command.\n\
    \         Note: servers SHOULD NOT have any UIDNOTSTICKY mail stores.\n      \
    \   This facility exists to support legacy mail stores in which it\n         is\
    \ technically infeasible to support persistent UIDs.  This\n         should be\
    \ avoided when designing new mail stores.\n   Example:    C: A003 APPEND saved-messages\

    \       S: A007 OK [READ-WRITE] SELECT completed\n   In this example, A003 and\
    \ A004 demonstrate successful appending and\n   copying to a mailbox that returns\
    \ the UIDs assigned to the messages.\n   A005 is an example in which no messages\
    \ were copied; this is because\n   in A003, we see that message 2 had UID 304,\
    \ and message 3 had UID\n   319; therefore, UIDs 305 through 310 do not exist\
    \ (refer to section\n   2.3.1.1 of [IMAP] for further explanation).  A006 is an\
    \ example of a\n   message being copied that did not return a COPYUID; and, as\
    \ expected,\n   A007 shows that the mail store containing that mailbox does not\n\
    \   support persistent UIDs.\n"
