  - "1.  Introduction\n   IEEE 802.16e is an air interface for fixed and mobile broadband\n\
    \   wireless access systems.  The IEEE 802.16 [802.16] standard specifies\n  \
    \ the air interface, including the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer\n   and multiple\
    \ physical layer (PHY) specifications.  It can be deployed\n   in licensed as\
    \ well as unlicensed spectrum.  While the PHY and MAC\n   are specified in IEEE\
    \ 802.16, the details of IPv4 and IPv6 operation\n   over the air interface are\
    \ not included.  This document specifies the\n   operation of IPv6 over the IEEE\
    \ 802.16 air interface.\n   IPv6 packets can be carried over the IEEE Std 802.16\
    \ specified air\n   interface via:\n   1.  the IP-specific part of the Packet\
    \ CS or\n   2.  the 802.3[802.3]-specific part of the Packet CS\n   The scope\
    \ of this specification is limited to the operation of IPv6\n   over IP CS only.\n\
    \   The IEEE 802.16 specification includes the PHY and MAC details.  The\n   convergence\
    \ sublayers are a part of the MAC.  The packet convergence\n   sublayer includes\
    \ the IP-specific part that is used by the IPv6\n   layer.\n   The mobile station\
    \ (MS)/host is attached to an access router via a\n   base station (BS).  The\
    \ host and the BS are connected via the IEEE\n   Std 802.16 air interface at the\
    \ link and physical layers.  The IPv6\n   link from the MS terminates at an access\
    \ router that may be a part of\n   the BS or an entity beyond the BS.  The base\
    \ station is a layer 2\n   entity (from the perspective of the IPv6 link between\
    \ the MS and\n   access router (AR)) and relays the IPv6 packets between the AR\
    \ and\n   the host via a point-to-point connection over the air interface.\n"

    \ specifies two main service-specific convergence\n   sublayers:\n   1.  ATM convergence\
    \ sublayer\n   2.  Packet convergence sublayer\n   The Packet CS is used for the\
    \ transport of packet-based protocols,\n   which include:\n   1.  IEEE Std 802.3(Ethernet)\n\
    \   2.  Internet Protocol (IPv4 and IPv6)\n   The service-specific CS resides\
    \ on top of the MAC Common Part\n   Sublayer (CPS) as shown in Figure 1.  The\
    \ service-specific CS is\n   responsible for:\n   o  accepting packets (Protocol\
    \ Data Units, PDUs) from the upper\n      layer,\n   o  performing classification\
    \ of the packet/PDU based on a set of\n      defined classifiers that are service\
    \ specific,\n   o  delivering the CS PDU to the appropriate service flow and\n\
    \      transport connection, and\n   o  receiving PDUs from the peer entity.\n\
    \   Payload header suppression (PHS) is also a function of the CS but is\n   optional.\n\

    \   Ethernet and IP, are defined in the IEEE 802.16 specification, which\n   enable\
    \ the packets from the upper layer to be processed by the\n   appropriate service-specific\
    \ part of the Packet CS.  IPv6 can be\n   transported directly over the IP-specific\

    \             of Packet CS\n     Figure 2: IPv6 over IP- and 802.3-specific parts\
    \ of the Packet CS\n   The figure above shows that while there are multiple methods\
    \ by which\n   IPv6 can be transmitted over an 802.16 air interface, the scope\
    \ of\n   this document is limited to IPv6 operation over IP CS only.\n   Transmission\
    \ of IP over Ethernet is specified in [IPoE-over-802.16].\n   Transmission of\
    \ IPv4 over IP CS is specified in [IPv4-over-IPCS].\n   It should be noted that\
    \ immediately after ranging (802.16 air\n   interface procedure) and exchange\
    \ of SBC-REQ/RSP messages (802.16\n   specific), the MS and BS exchange their\
    \ capabilities via REG-REQ\n   (Registration Request) and REG-RSP (Registration\
    \ Response) 802.16 MAC\n   messages.  These management frames negotiate parameters\
    \ such as the\n   Convergence Sublayer supported by the MS and BS.  By default,\
    \ Packet,\n   IPv4, and 802.3/Ethernet are supported.  IPv6 via the IP CS is\n\
    \   supported by the MS and the BS only when the IPv6 support bit in the\n   capability\
    \ negotiation messages (REG-REQ and REG-RSP) implying such\n   support is indicated\
    \ in the parameter \"Classification/PHS options and\n   SDU (Service Data Unit)\
    \ encapsulation support\" (refer to [802.16]).\n   Additionally, during the establishment\
    \ of the transport connection\n   for transporting IPv6 packets, the DSA-REQ (Dynamic\
    \ Service Addition)\n   and DSA-RSP messages between the BS and MS indicate via\
    \ the CS-\n   Specification TLV the CS that the connection being set up shall\
    \ use.\n   When the IPv6 packet is preceded by the IEEE 802.16 6-byte MAC\n  \
    \ header, there is no specific indication in the MAC header itself\n   about the\
    \ payload type.  The processing of the packet is based\n   entirely on the classifiers.\
    \  Based on the classification rules, the\n   MAC layer selects an appropriate\
    \ transport connection for the\n   transmission of the packet.  An IPv6 packet\
    \ is transported over a\n   transport connection that is specifically established\
    \ for carrying\n   such packets.\n   Transmission of IPv6 as explained above is\
    \ possible via multiple\n   methods, i.e., via IP CS or via Ethernet interfaces.\
    \  Every Internet\n   host connected via an 802.16 link:\n   1.  MUST be able\
    \ to send and receive IPv6 packets via IP CS when the\n       MS and BS indicate\
    \ IPv6 protocol support over IP CS\n   2.  MUST be able to send and receive IPv6\
    \ packets over the Ethernet\n       (802.3)-specific part of the Packet CS when\
    \ the MS and BS\n       indicate IPv6 protocol support over Ethernet CS.  However,\
    \ when\n       the MS and BS indicate IPv6 protocol support over both IP CS and\n\
    \       Ethernet CS, the MS and BS MUST use IP CS for sending and\n       receiving\
    \ IPv6 packets.\n   When the MS and BS support IPv6 over IP CS, it MUST be used\
    \ as the\n   default mode for transporting IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.16 and the\n\
    \   recommendations in this document that are followed.  Inability to\n   negotiate\
    \ a common convergence sublayer for IPv6 transport between\n   the MS and BS will\
    \ result in failure to set up the transport\n   connection and thereby render\
    \ the host unable to send and receive\n   IPv6 packets.  In the case of a host\
    \ that implements more than one\n   method of transporting IPv6 packets, the default\
    \ choice of which\n   method to use (i.e., IPv6 over the IP CS or IPv6 over 802.3)\
    \ is IPv6\n   over IP CS when the BS also supports such capability.\n   In any\
    \ case, the MS and BS MUST negotiate at most one convergence\n   sublayer for\
    \ IPv6 transport on a given link.\n   In addition, to ensure interoperability\
    \ between devices that support\n   different encapsulations, it is REQUIRED that\
    \ BS implementations\n   support all standards-track encapsulations defined for\
    \ 802.16 by the\n   IETF.  At the time of writing this specification, this is\
    \ the only\n   encapsulation, but additional specifications are being worked on.\
    \  It\n   is, however, not required that the BS implementations use all the\n\
    \   encapsulations they support; some modes of operation may be off by\n   configuration.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.1.  IPv6 Link in 802.16\n   In 802.16, the transport connection between an\
    \ MS and a BS is used to\n   transport user data, i.e., IPv6 packets in this case.\
    \  A transport\n   connection is represented by a CID, and multiple transport\n\
    \   connections can exist between an MS and a BS.\n   When an AR and a BS are\
    \ colocated, the collection of transport\n   connections to an MS is defined as\
    \ a single link.  When an AR and a\n   BS are separated, it is recommended that\
    \ a tunnel be established\n   between the AR and a BS whose granularity is no\
    \ greater than 'per MS'\n   or 'per service flow' (An MS can have multiple service\
    \ flows which\n   are identified by a service flow ID).  Then the tunnel(s) for\

    \   point-to-point link.\n   The collection of service flows (tunnels) to an MS\

    \   is fully consistent with a standard IP link, without exception, and\n   conforms\
    \ with the definition of a point-to-point link in neighbor\n   discovery for IPv6\
    \ [RFC4861].  Hence, the point-to-point link model\n   for IPv6 operation over\
    \ the IP-specific part of the Packet CS in\n   802.16 SHOULD be used.  A unique\
    \ IPv6 prefix(es) per link (MS/host)\n   MUST be assigned.\n"
- title: 6.2.  IPv6 Link Establishment in 802.16
  contents:
  - "6.2.  IPv6 Link Establishment in 802.16\n   In order to enable the sending and\
    \ receiving of IPv6 packets between\n   the MS and the AR, the link between the\
    \ MS and the AR via the BS\n   needs to be established.  This section illustrates\
    \ the link\n   establishment procedure.\n   The MS goes through the network entry\
    \ procedure as specified by\n   802.16.  A high-level description of the network\
    \ entry procedure is\n   as follows:\n   1.  The MS performs initial ranging with\
    \ the BS.  Ranging is a\n       process by which an MS becomes time aligned with\
    \ the BS.  The MS\n       is synchronized with the BS at the successful completion\
    \ of\n       ranging and is ready to set up a connection.\n   2.  The MS and BS\
    \ exchange basic capabilities that are necessary for\n       effective communication\
    \ during the initialization using SBC-REQ/\n       RSP (802.16 specific) messages.\n\
    \   3.  The MS progresses to an authentication phase.  Authentication is\n   \
    \    based on Privacy Key Management version 2 (PKMv2) as defined in\n       the\
    \ IEEE Std 802.16 specification.\n   4.  On successful completion of authentication,\
    \ the MS performs\n       802.16 registration with the network.\n   5.  The MS\
    \ and BS perform capability exchange as per 802.16\n       procedures.  Protocol\
    \ support is indicated in this exchange.  The\n       CS capability parameter\
    \ indicates which classification/PHS\n       options and SDU encapsulation the\
    \ MS supports.  By default,\n       Packet, IPv4, and 802.3/Ethernet shall be\
    \ supported; thus,\n       absence of this parameter in REG-REQ (802.16 message)\
    \ means that\n       named options are supported by the MS/SS.  Support for IPv6\
    \ over\n       the IP-specific part of the Packet CS is indicated by Bit #2 of\n\
    \       the CS capability parameter (refer to [802.16]).\n   6.  The MS MUST request\
    \ the establishment of a service flow for IPv6\n       packets over IP CS if the\
    \ MS and BS have confirmed capability for\n       supporting IPv6 over IP CS.\
    \  The service flow MAY also be\n       triggered by the network as a result of\
    \ pre-provisioning.  The\n       service flow establishes a link between the MS\
    \ and the AR over\n       which IPv6 packets can be sent and received.\n   7.\
    \  The AR and MS SHOULD send router advertisements and solicitations\n       as\
    \ specified in neighbor discovery [RFC4861].\n   The above flow does not show\
    \ the actual 802.16 messages that are used\n   for ranging, capability exchange,\
    \ or service flow establishment.\n   Details of these are in [802.16].\n"

    \ on an 802.16 link is configurable.\n   The default MTU for IPv6 packets over\
    \ an 802.16 link SHOULD be 1500\n   octets.\n   The 802.16 MAC PDU is composed\
    \ of a 6-byte header followed by an\n   optional payload and an optional CRC covering\
    \ the header and the\n   payload.  The length of the PDU is indicated by the Len\
    \ parameter in\n   the Generic MAC header.  The Len parameter has a size of 11\

    \   can vary.  In certain deployment scenarios, the MTU value can be\n   greater\
    \ than the default.  Neighbor discovery for IPv6 [RFC4861]\n   defines an MTU\
    \ option that an AR MUST advertise, via router\n   advertisement (RA), if a value\
    \ different from 1500 is used.  The MN\n   processes this option as defined in\

  contents:
  - "7.  IPv6 Prefix Assignment\n   The MS and the AR are connected via a point-to-point\

    \   serves multiple IPv6 hosts may be the end point of the connection.\n   Hence,\
    \ one or more /64 prefixes SHOULD be assigned to a link.  The\n   prefixes are\
    \ advertised with the on-link (L-bit) flag set as\n   specified in [RFC4861].\

  contents:
  - "8.1.  Router Solicitation\n   On completion of the establishment of the IPv6\
    \ link, the MS may send\n   a router solicitation message to solicit a router\
    \ advertisement\n   message from the AR to acquire necessary information as per\
    \ the\n   neighbor discovery for IPv6 specification [RFC4861].  An MS that is\n\
    \   network attached may also send router solicitations at any time.\n   Movement\
    \ detection at the IP layer of an MS in many cases is based on\n   receiving periodic\
    \ router advertisements.  An MS may also detect\n   changes in its attachment\
    \ via link triggers or other means.  The MS\n   can act on such triggers by sending\
    \ router solicitations.  The router\n   solicitation is sent over the IPv6 link\
    \ that has been previously\n   established.  The MS sends router solicitations\
    \ to the all-routers\n   multicast address.  It is carried over the point-to-point\
    \ link to the\n   AR via the BS.  The MS does not need to be aware of the link-local\n\
    \   address of the AR in order to send a router solicitation at any time.\n  \
    \ The use of router advertisements as a means for movement detection is\n   not\
    \ recommended for MNs connected via 802.16 links as the frequency\n   of periodic\
    \ router advertisements would have to be high.\n"

  - "Appendix A.  WiMAX Network Architecture and IPv6 Support\n   The WiMAX (Worldwide\
    \ Interoperability for Microwave Access) forum\n   [WMF] has defined a network\
    \ architecture in which the air interface\n   is based on the IEEE 802.16 standard.\
    \  The addressing and operation\n   of IPv6 described in this document are applicable\
    \ to the WiMAX\n   network as well.\n   WiMAX is an example architecture of a\
    \ network that uses the 802.16\n   specification for the air interface.  WiMAX\
    \ networks are also in the\n   process of being deployed in various parts of the\
    \ world, and the\n   operation of IPv6 within a WiMAX network is explained in\
    \ this\n   appendix.\n   The WiMAX network architecture consists of the Access\
    \ Service Network\n   (ASN) and the Connectivity Service Network (CSN).  The ASN\
    \ is the\n   access network that includes the BS and the AR in addition to other\n\
    \   functions such as AAA, mobile IP foreign agent, paging controller,\n   location\
    \ register, etc.  The ASN is defined as a complete set of\n   network functions\
    \ needed to provide radio access to a WiMAX\n   subscriber.  The ASN is the access\
    \ network to which the MS attaches.\n   The IPv6 access router is an entity within\
    \ the ASN.  The term ASN is\n   specific to the WiMAX network architecture.  The\
    \ CSN is the entity\n   that provides connectivity to the Internet and includes\
    \ functions\n   such as mobile IP home agent and AAA.  The figure below shows\
    \ the\n   WiMAX reference model:\n                        -------------------\n\

    \ 7: WiMAX network reference model\n   Three different types of ASN realizations\
    \ called profiles are defined\n   by the architecture.  ASNs of profile types\
    \ A and C include BS' and\n   ASN-gateway(s) (ASN-GW), which are connected to\
    \ each other via an R6\n   interface.  An ASN of profile type B is one in which\
    \ the\n   functionality of the BS and other ASN functions are merged together.\n\
    \   No ASN-GW is specifically defined in a profile B ASN.  The absence of\n  \
    \ the R6 interface is also a profile B specific characteristic.  The MS\n   at\
    \ the IPv6 layer is associated with the AR in the ASN.  The AR may\n   be a function\
    \ of the ASN-GW in the case of profiles A and C and is a\n   function in the ASN\
    \ in the case of profile B.  When the BS and the AR\n   are separate entities\
    \ and linked via the R6 interface, IPv6 packets\n   between the BS and the AR\
    \ are carried over a Generic Routing\n   Encapsulation (GRE) tunnel.  The granularity\
    \ of the GRE tunnel should\n   be on a per-MS basis or on a per-service-flow basis\
    \ (an MS can have\n   multiple service flows, each of which is identified uniquely\
    \ by a\n   service flow ID).  The protocol stack in WiMAX for IPv6 is shown\n\

- title: Appendix B.  IPv6 Link in WiMAX
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.  IPv6 Link in WiMAX\n   WiMAX is an example of a network based on\
    \ the IEEE Std 802.16 air\n   interface.  This section describes the IPv6 link\
    \ in the context of a\n   WiMAX network.  The MS and the AR are connected via\
    \ a combination of:\n   1.  The transport connection that is identified by a Connection\n\
    \       Identifier (CID) over the air interface, i.e., the MS and BS, and\n  \
    \ 2.  A GRE tunnel between the BS and AR that transports the IPv6\n       packets\n\
    \   From an IPv6 perspective, the MS and the AR are connected by a point-\n  \
    \ to-point link.  The combination of transport connection over the air\n   interface\
    \ and the GRE tunnel between the BS and AR creates a (point-\n   to-point) tunnel\
    \ at the layer below IPv6.\n   The collection of service flows (tunnels) to an\
    \ MS is defined as a\n   single link.  Each link has only an MS and an AR.  Each\
    \ MS belongs to\n   a different link.  No two MSs belong to the same link.  A\
    \ different\n   prefix should be assigned to each unique link.  This link is fully\n\
    \   consistent with a standard IP link, without exception, and conforms\n   with\
    \ the definition of a point-to-point link in [RFC4861].\n"
- title: Appendix C.  IPv6 Link Establishment in WiMAX
  contents:
  - "Appendix C.  IPv6 Link Establishment in WiMAX\n   The mobile station performs\
    \ initial network entry as specified in\n   802.16.  On successful completion\
    \ of the network entry procedure, the\n   ASN gateway/AR triggers the establishment\
    \ of the initial service flow\n   (ISF) for IPv6 towards the MS.  The ISF is a\
    \ GRE tunnel between the\n   ASN-GW/AR and the BS.  The BS in turn requests the\
    \ MS to establish a\n   transport connection over the air interface.  The end\
    \ result is a\n   transport connection over the air interface for carrying IPv6\
    \ packets\n   and a GRE tunnel between the BS and AR for relaying the IPv6 packets.\n\
    \   On successful completion of the establishment of the ISF, IPv6\n   packets\
    \ can be sent and received between the MS and AR.  The ISF\n   enables the MS\
    \ to communicate with the AR for host configuration\n   procedures.  After the\
    \ establishment of the ISF, the AR can send a\n   router advertisement to the\
    \ MS.  An MS can establish multiple service\n   flows with different quality of\
    \ service (QoS) characteristics.  The\n   ISF can be considered as the primary\
    \ service flow.  The ASN-GW/AR\n   treats each ISF, along with the other service\
    \ flows to the same MS,\n   as a unique link that is managed as a (virtual) interface.\n"
- title: Appendix D.  Maximum Transmission Unit in WiMAX
  contents:
  - "Appendix D.  Maximum Transmission Unit in WiMAX\n   The WiMAX forum [WMF] has\
    \ specified the Max SDU size as 1522 octets.\n   Hence, the IPv6 path MTU can\
    \ be 1500 octets.  However, because of the\n   overhead of the GRE tunnel used\
    \ to transport IPv6 packets between the\n   BS and AR and the 6-byte MAC header\
    \ over the air interface, using a\n   value of 1500 would result in fragmentation\
    \ of packets.  It is\n   recommended that the MTU for IPv6 be set to 1400 octets\
    \ in WiMAX\n   networks, and this value (different from the default) be communicated\n\
    \   to the MS.  Note that the 1522-octet specification is a WiMAX forum\n   specification\
    \ and not the size of the SDU that can be transmitted\n   over 802.16, which has\
    \ a higher limit.\n"
