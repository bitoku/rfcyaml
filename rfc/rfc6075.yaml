- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The [ACAP] specification includes the specification and\
    \ creation of\n   the ACAP Vendor Registry, and this registry has subsequently\
    \ been\n   reused by several specifications, including both [ANNOTATE] and\n \
    \  [METADATA], and is proving to be a useful mechanism for namespacing\n   various\
    \ names to within a specific vendor's scope.\n   The use of textual rather than\
    \ numeric identifiers for vendors\n   benefits engineers and operators who are\
    \ diagnosing protocol problems\n   by allowing them some possibility of identifying\
    \ the origin of a\n   vendor attribute without having to look it up in a registry\
    \ (although\n   that remains a necessary fallback).  As such, engineers and operators\n\
    \   already have to be familiar with international technical English to\n   diagnose\
    \ textual protocol problems, the restriction to ASCII may help\n   and is not\
    \ believed to harm that intended use.  Exposure of vendor\n   attributes directly\
    \ in end-user user interfaces was not an intended\n   use of the registry.\n \
    \  This document merely updates the registry to reduce ambiguity in the\n   original\
    \ specification and dissociates it from the original document\n   in all but name,\
    \ allowing easier referencing.  It replaces Section\n   7.4 and portions of Section\
    \ 4, particularly Section 4.3, of [ACAP].\n"
- title: 2.  Conventions Used in This Document
  contents:
  - "2.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [KEYWORDS].\n   The formal syntax is to be considered normative and is specified\n\
    \   using [ABNF].  Where a formal syntax and the prose are in conflict,\n   the\
    \ formal syntax takes precedence.\n"
- title: 3.  The Vendor Subtree Registry
  contents:
  - "3.  The Vendor Subtree Registry\n   A Vendor Token is a UTF-8 string that begins\
    \ with \"vendor.\" and that\n   is followed by the name of the company or product.\
    \  This name MUST\n   NOT contain any slash character, period, or the percent\
    \ and asterisk\n   characters typically used as wildcards.\n   Following this\
    \ may be names, separated from the Vendor Token by a\n   period, which need not\
    \ be registered, thus forming a complete Vendor\n   Name.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Internationalization
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Internationalization\n   Vendor Tokens are able to contain any valid Unicode\
    \ codepoint,\n   encoded as [UTF-8], except the special characters.  Since the\n\
    \   publication of [ACAP], however, concerns have been raised on the\n   handling\
    \ and comparison of full Unicode strings; therefore, this\n   specification restricts\
    \ the current registrations to the ASCII subset\n   of UTF-8.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ characters such as ASCII control characters, most\n   whitespace, and quotes\
    \ are likely to be confusing and have been\n   similarly restricted.\n   Therefore,\
    \ this document allows only ASCII letters, digits, the\n   hyphen, and space to\
    \ be used in registrations (the <iana-vendor-tag>\n   ABNF production in Section\
    \ 3.2).\n   At the time of publication of this document, no existing\n   registrations\
    \ violate the new restricted syntax on characters allowed\n   in registrations.\
    \  [ACAP] required all Vendor Tokens to be registered\n   with IANA, so the new\
    \ restriction is not believed to introduce any\n   interoperability issue.\n \
    \  Finally, note that this document does not change the requirement on\n   processors\
    \ to accept other non-ASCII Unicode codepoints in Vendor\n   Tokens (the <possible-vendor-tag>\
    \ ABNF production in Section 3.2).\n"
- title: 3.2.  Formal Syntax
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Formal Syntax\n   This syntax draws upon productions found within [ABNF]\
    \ and [UTF-8].\n   Productions replace those in Section 4.3 of [ACAP].\n   vendor-name\

    \                     ;; MUST be able to accept.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Examples
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Examples\n   A company Example, Ltd. might register the Subtree \"vendor.example\"\
    .\n   This means it may use \"vendor.example\", or any name at all beginning\n\
    \   \"vendor.example.\", such as \"vendor.example.product\".\n   These names might\
    \ be used in several protocols, and are reserved in\n   all the relevant protocols,\
    \ so \"vendor.example\" might be an ACAP\n   [ACAP] dataset class name, and \"\
    /vendor/vendor.example\" might be a\n   tree of IMAP ANNOTATE entries [ANNOTATE].\n\
    \   Example, Ltd. is free to use either \"vendor.example\", and group\n   specific\
    \ products under it using the relevant protocol's hierarchy --\n   perhaps \"\
    /shared/vendor/vendor.example/product\" annotation\n   [ANNOTATE], or using more\
    \ specific names, such as \"/shared/vendor/\n   vendor.example.product\" annotation.\n\
    \   Note that the solidus (\"/\") characters in the examples above are\n   protocol\
    \ delimiters that are themselves not part of the Vendor Token.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Changes from RFC 2244
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Changes from RFC 2244\n   This non-normative section details changes from\
    \ the original\n   specification of the registry in RFC 2244.\n   o  Vendor Tokens\
    \ are restricted to ASCII for registration purposes.\n   o  Clarifications that\
    \ \"vendor.<company/product name>\" means\n      \"vendor.company name\" or \"\
    vendor.product name\" - \"vendor.company/\n      product\" is and always has been\
    \ illegal.\n   o  Made \"vendor.company\" a name in its own right - RFC 2244 only\n\
    \      refers to a prefix of \"vendor.company.\".\n   o  Added example registration,\
    \ in line with [EXAMPLES].\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   This specification updates the IANA registry named\
    \ the ACAP \"Vendor\n   Subtrees\" registry.  IANA has updated the registry to\
    \ point at this\n   document.\n   Vendors may reserve a portion of the ACAP namespace,\
    \ which is also\n   used as the namespace for several other protocols, for private\
    \ use.\n   Vendor Names are reserved for use by that company or product,\n   wherever\
    \ used, once registered.  Registration is on a first come,\n   first served basis.\
    \  Whenever possible, private attributes and\n   classes should be eschewed in\
    \ favour of improving interoperable\n   protocols.\n   Vendors may only use names\
    \ conforming to iana-vendor-tag at the\n   current time; future revisions of this\
    \ specification may change this.\n   To: iana@iana.org\n   Subject: Registration\
    \ of ACAP Vendor Subtree\n   Private Prefix: vendor.name\n   Person and email\
    \ address to contact for further information:\n   (company names and addresses\
    \ should be included where appropriate)\n"
- title: 4.1.  Example Registration
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Example Registration\n   IANA is requested to add the following registration,\
    \ for use by\n   specification authors in examples, similarly to the domains specified\n\
    \   in [EXAMPLES]:\n   To: iana@iana.org\n   Subject: Registration of ACAP Vendor\
    \ Subtree\n   Private Prefix: vendor.example\n   Person and email address to contact\
    \ for further information:\n   Dave Cridland <dave.cridland@isode.com>\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   There are no known security issues with this\
    \ registry.  Individual\n   protocols using Vendor Subtree names may have security\
    \ issues, and\n   the introduction of Unicode has, in itself, security implications\
    \ --\n   the restriction of this is thought to mitigate these.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  Acknowledgements\n   Thanks must go to Chris Newman, John Myers, and the\
    \ other designers\n   of ACAP for the initial creation of the registry.  Thanks\
    \ also to\n   Alexey Melnikov for advice on this revision.\n"
