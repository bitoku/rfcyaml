  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes a convention for using the Cryptographic\n\
    \   Message Syntax (CMS) [CMS] to protect a content collection.  The\n   content-collection\
    \ content type is used to transfer one or more\n   contents, each identified by\
    \ a content type.  If desired, the\n   content-with-attributes content type can\
    \ be used to associate\n   arbitrary attributes with the content.\n   The convention\
    \ described in this document is not needed when CMS is\n   used with MIME [MSG].\
    \  MIME multipart [MIME] provides a\n   straightforward and widely deployed mechanism\
    \ for carrying more than\n   one content item, each associated with a MIME type.\n\
    \   However, CMS is not always used with MIME.  Sometimes CMS is used in\n   an\
    \ exclusively ASN.1 [ASN1] environment.  In this case, the content-\n   collection\
    \ content type is used to gather more than one content item,\n   each with an\
    \ object identifier to specify the content type.\n   In this document, the key\
    \ words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD,\n   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and\
    \ OPTIONAL are to be interpreted as\n   described in [STDWORDS].\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Content Collection Example\n   This section provides one simple example\
    \ to illustrate the need for\n   the content-collection content type.  Consider\
    \ an art collector who\n   wants to sell one of his pieces, an ancient Greek urn\
    \ called an\n   amphora.  The collector wants to compose a digitally signed offer\
    \ for\n   sale.  It includes three parts.  The first part contains the owner's\n\
    \   offer for sale, including the asking price.  The second part contains\n  \
    \ a high-quality image of the amphora.  The final part contains an\n   appraisal\
    \ from a well-respected ceramics expert.  The final part is\n   digitally signed\
    \ by the expert.  Figure 1 illustrates the structure,\n   and the CMS SignedData\
    \ content type is used for the two digital\n   signatures.\n   +---------------------------------------------------------+\n\
