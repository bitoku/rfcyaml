  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF has specified Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213]\
    \ as the\n   base protocol for network-based localized mobility management\n \
    \  (NetLMM).  The scope of the base protocol covers the setup and\n   maintenance\
    \ of a tunnel between a Mobile Node's (MN's) Mobile Access\n   Gateway (MAG) and\
    \ its selected Local Mobility Anchor (LMA).  Data\n   packets will always traverse\
    \ the MN's MAG and its LMA, irrespective\n   of the location of the MN's remote\
    \ communication endpoint.  Even\n   though an MN may be attached to the same MAG\
    \ or a different MAG as\n   its Correspondent Node (CN) within the same provider\
    \ domain, packets\n   being associated with their communication will traverse\
    \ the MN's and\n   the CN's LMA, which can be located topologically far away from\
    \ the\n   MN's and the CN's MAG or even in a separate provider domain.\n   [RFC5213]\
    \ addresses the need to enable local routing of traffic\n   between two nodes\
    \ being attached to the same MAG, but does not\n   specify the complete procedure\
    \ to establish such localized routing\n   state on the shared MAG.\n   The NetLMM\
    \ Extensions (NetExt) Working Group has an objective to\n   design a solution\
    \ for localized routing in PMIPv6.  This objective\n   includes the specification\
    \ of protocol messages and associated\n   protocol operation between PMIPv6 components\
    \ to support the setup of\n   a direct routing path for data packets between the\
    \ MN's and the CN's\n   MAG, while both hosts receive mobility service according\
    \ to the\n   PMIPv6 protocol [RFC5213].  As a result of localized routing, these\n\
    \   packets will be forwarded between the two associated MAGs without\n   traversing\
    \ the MN's and the CN's LMA(s).  In cases where one or both\n   nodes hand over\
    \ to a different MAG, the localized routing protocol\n   maintains the localized\
    \ routing path.  Relevant protocol interfaces\n   may include the interface between\
    \ associated MAGs, between a MAG and\n   an LMA, and between LMAs.  The setup\
    \ of localized routing with CNs\n   not registered with a PMIPv6 network is out\
    \ of scope of the NetExt\n   solution and this problem statement.\n   This document\
    \ analyzes and discusses the problem space of always\n   using the default route\
    \ through two communicating mobile nodes' local\n   mobility anchors.  Furthermore,\
    \ the problem space of enabling\n   localized routing in PMIPv6 is analyzed and\
    \ described, while\n   different communication and mobility scenarios are taken\
    \ into\n   account.  Based on the analysis, a list of key functional\n   requirements\
    \ is provided, serving as input to the design of the\n   protocol solution.\n"

- title: 3.1.  General Observation
  contents:
  - "3.1.  General Observation\n   The Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) protocol [RFC3775] has\
    \ built-in mechanisms\n   for direct communication between an MN and a CN.  Mechanisms\
    \ for\n   route optimization in MIPv6 cannot be directly applied in PMIPv6.\n\
    \   Following the paradigm of PMIPv6, MNs are not involved in mobility\n   signaling\
    \ and hence cannot perform signaling to set up localized\n   routes.  Instead,\
    \ the solution for localized routing must consider\n   functions in the network\
    \ to find out whether or not a localized route\n   is to be used and then control\
    \ the setup and maintenance of localized\n   routing states accordingly without\
    \ any assistance from the MN and the\n   CN.  In the case of communication between\
    \ two nodes attached to the\n   PMIPv6 network infrastructure and where each node\
    \ is registered with\n   an LMA, data packets between these two nodes will always\
    \ traverse the\n   responsible LMA(s).  At least some deployments would benefit\
    \ from\n   having such communication localized, rather than having packets\n \
    \  traverse the core network to the LMA(s).  In the context of this\n   document,\
    \ such localized communication comprises offloading traffic\n   from LMAs and\
    \ establishing an optimized forwarding path between the\n   two communication\
    \ endpoints.\n   Localized routing is understood in [RFC5213] as optimization\
    \ of\n   traffic between an MN and a CN that are attached to an access link\n\
    \   connected to the same MAG.  In such a case, the MAG forwards traffic\n   directly\
    \ between the MN and the CN, assuming the MAG is enabled to\n   support this feature\
    \ (setting of the EnableMAGLocalRouting flag on\n   the MAG) and the MN's LMA\
    \ enforces this optimization.  [RFC5213] does\n   not specify how an LMA can enforce\
    \ optimization for such local\n   communication.  Maintaining local forwarding\
    \ between the MN and the\n   regular IPv6 CN gets more complex in the case where\
    \ the MN performs a\n   handover to a different MAG.  Such a use case is not considered\
    \ in\n   the specification and is out of scope of this problem statement.\n  \
    \ This document focuses on use cases where both nodes, the MN and the\n   CN,\
    \ are within a PMIPv6 network and served by an LMA in a domain of\n   LMAs.\n\
    \   With localized routing, operators have the possibility of offloading\n   traffic\
    \ from LMAs and from the core network.  Establishment of a\n   direct path between\
    \ the MN's and the CN's MAG can be beneficial for\n   the following reasons: First,\
    \ by limiting the communication to the\n   access nodes, the data traffic traversing\
    \ the MAG - LMA path\n   (network) can be reduced.  This is significant, considering\
    \ that the\n   transport network between the access and the core is often the\n\
    \   bottleneck in terms of costs and performance.  Second, there may be\n   performance\
    \ benefits for data flows between the MN and the CN in\n   terms of delay and\
    \ packet loss, especially when the MN and the CN are\n   attached to the same\
    \ MAG and the LMA is topologically far away from\n   that MAG.  Even when the\
    \ MN and the CN are attached to different\n   MAGs, there could be benefit in\
    \ limiting the communication to the\n   access network only, rather than traversing\
    \ the transport network to\n   the LMA.  Furthermore, offloading traffic from\
    \ the LMA by means of\n   localized routing can improve scalability of the LMA,\
    \ as it\n   represents a bottleneck for traffic being forwarded by many MAGs.\n"

    \ Architecture for Localized Routing in PMIPv6\n   All \"A\" use cases below assume\
    \ that both the MN and the CN are\n   registered with an LMA according to the\
    \ PMIPv6 protocol.  Whereas\n   MAG1 is always considered as the MN's current\
    \ Proxy Care-of Address,\n   the CN can be either connected to the same MAG or\
    \ to a different MAG\n   or LMA as the MN.  Accordingly, these topological differences\
    \ are\n   denoted as follows:\n   A[number of MAGs][number of LMAs]\n   A11: The\
    \ MN and the CN (CN1) connect to the same MAG (MAG1) and are\n      registered\
    \ with the same LMA (LMA).  The common MAG may forward\n      data packets between\
    \ the MN and the CN directly without forwarding\n      any packet to the LMA.\
    \  [RFC5213] addresses this use case, but\n      does not specify the complete\
    \ procedure to establish such\n      localized routing state on the shared MAG.\n\
    \   A12: The MN and the CN (CN1) connect to the same MAG (MAG1) and are\n    \
    \  registered with different LMAs (LMA1 and LMA2).  The common MAG\n      may\
    \ forward data packets between the MN and the CN directly\n      without forwarding\
    \ any packet to the LMAs.  Following the policy\n      of [RFC5213] and enforcement\
    \ of the setup of a localized\n      forwarding path, potential problems exist\
    \ in the case where LMA1\n      and LMA2 differ in their policy to control the\
    \ MAG.\n   A21: The CN (CN2) connects to a different MAG (MAG2) than the MN\n\
    \      (MAG1), but the MN and the CN are registered with the same LMA\n      (LMA1).\
    \  The result of localized routing should be the existence\n      of routing information\
    \ at MAG1 and MAG2, which allows direct\n      forwarding of packets between the\
    \ MN's MAG1 and the CN's MAG2.  As\n      LMA1 is the common anchor for the MN\
    \ and the CN and maintains\n      location information for both nodes, no major\
    \ race condition and\n      instability in updating the states for localized routing\
    \ is\n      expected.\n   A22: The CN (CN2) connects to a different MAG (MAG2)\
    \ and a different\n      LMA (LMA2) than the MN (MAG1, LMA1).  The result of localized\n\
    \      routing should be the existence of routing information at MAG1 and\n  \
    \    MAG2, which allows direct forwarding of packets between the MN's\n      MAG1\
    \ and the CN's MAG2.  As the location information of the CN and\n      the MN\
    \ is maintained at different LMAs, both LMAs need to be\n      involved in the\
    \ procedure to set up localized routing.  In the\n      case of a handover of\
    \ the MN and/or the CN to a different MAG,\n      non-synchronized control of\
    \ updating the states for localized\n      routing may result in race conditions,\
    \ superfluous signaling, and\n      packet loss.\n   The following list summarizes\
    \ general problems with setting up and\n   maintaining localized routing between\
    \ an MN and a CN.  In the context\n   of this problem statement, the MN and the\
    \ CN are always assumed to be\n   registered at an LMA according to the PMIPv6\
    \ protocol [RFC5213].\n   o  MNs do not participate in mobility management and\
    \ hence cannot\n      perform binding registration at a CN on their own.  Rather,\n\
    \      entities in the network infrastructure must take over the role of\n   \
    \   MNs to set up and maintain a direct route.  Accordingly, a\n      solution\
    \ for localized routing in PMIPv6 must specify protocol\n      operation between\
    \ relevant network components, such as between a\n      MAG and an LMA, to enable\
    \ localized routing for data traffic\n      without traversing the MN's and the\
    \ CN's LMA(s).\n   o  In the case where the MN and the CN are both registered\
    \ with\n      different LMAs according to the PMIPv6 protocol, relevant\n    \
    \  information for the setup of a localized routing path, such as the\n      current\
    \ MAG of the MN and the CN, is distributed between these\n      LMAs.  This may\
    \ complicate the setup and stable maintenance of\n      states enabling localized\
    \ routing.\n   o  In the case where localized routing between an MN and a CN has\n\
    \      been successfully set up and both nodes move and attach to a new\n    \
    \  access router simultaneously, signaling the new location and\n      maintenance\
    \ of states for localized routing at relevant routers\n      may run into a race\
    \ condition situation.  This can happen in the\n      case where coordination\
    \ of signaling for localized routing and\n      provisioning of relevant state\
    \ information is distributed between\n      different network entities, e.g.,\
    \ different LMAs.  In such a case,\n      as a result of the MN's handover, updated\
    \ information about the\n      MN's location may arrive at the CN's previous MAG,\
    \ while the CN\n      has already moved to a new MAG.  The same applies to the\
    \ other\n      direction, where the system may update the MN's previous MAG about\n\
    \      the CN's new location, while the MN has moved to a new MAG in the\n   \
    \   meantime.  The protocol solution must deal with such exceptional\n      handover\
    \ cases efficiently to avoid or resolve such problems.\n"

  - "3.3.  IPv4 Considerations\n   According to [RFC5844], the basic configuration\
    \ requirements for\n   supporting IPv4 in PMIPv6 are that LMAs and MAGs are both\
    \ IPv4 and\n   IPv6 enabled.  Also, LMAs and MAGs must have a globally unique\
    \ IPv6\n   address configured, irrespective of enabled support for IPv6 routing\n\
    \   between these components.  This requirement should also apply to\n   configuration\
    \ requirements of localized routing.\n   Additional issues emerge when localized\
    \ routing is considered for\n   PMIPv6 with IPv4 support.  These can be classified\
    \ into two general\n   groups: issues with localized routing between an MN's and\
    \ a CN's IPv4\n   Home Addresses, and transport plane issues.  The following\n\
    \   subsections analyze these two groups.\n"

    \ the case where an LMA and a MAG hold a registration to support\n   IPv4 Home\
    \ Address mobility for an MN, the MAG and the LMA must\n   support appropriate\
    \ encapsulation of IPv4 packets.  To enable\n   localized routing, the MN's MAG\

    \ MAG and needs to ensure that the\n   chosen encapsulation mode is supported\

    \ causes failure in\n   setting up a localized route.\n   When localized routing\
    \ is used for IPv4 traffic, the conceptual data\n   structures on associated MAGs\

    \ that need to be\n   performed by the PMIPv6-enabled network infrastructure to\
    \ substitute\n   mobile nodes in setting up a direct route.\n   o  Detection of\
    \ the possibility to perform localized routing.  This\n      function includes\
    \ looking at a data packet's source and\n      destination address.\n   o  Initiation\
    \ of a procedure that sets up a localized routing path.\n   o  Discovery of stateful\
    \ entities (i.e., the LMA(s) and/or the\n      MAG(s)) that maintain and can provide\
    \ relevant information needed\n      to set up a localized routing path.  Such\
    \ information may include\n      the routable address of an LMA or MAG, where\
    \ one or both mobile\n      nodes are connected to and registered with that LMA\
    \ or MAG.\n   o  Control in setting up and maintaining (e.g., during handover)\
    \ the\n      localized routing path.  Control is also needed to terminate the\n\
    \      use of a localized routing path and to delete associated states,\n    \
    \  whereas a trigger for the termination may come from a non-PMIPv6-\n      related\
    \ component.\n   o  Enforcement of administrative policy rules to localized routing.\n\
    \      Such policies allow operators to have further control of the setup\n  \
    \    of a localized route and enable the possibility to disallow\n      localized\
    \ routing, for example, to ensure that traffic traverses\n      charging-related\
    \ functions on the LMA.  Explicit authorization of\n      localized routing is,\
    \ for example, discussed in [PMIP6-LR].  As a\n      further example, mobile-node-\
    \ and operator-specific policy rules\n      can be established on PMIPv6 components\
    \ during PMIPv6\n      bootstrapping according to [RFC5779].\n"

  - "5.  Roaming Considerations\n   Figure 2 shows PMIPv6 roaming cases where PMIPv6\
    \ components (e.g.,\n   LMAs, MAGs) tied by the MN and the CN may be distributed\
    \ between\n   different provider domains (i.e., domain A, B, C) and the MN and/or\n\
    \   CN moves from one provider domain to another one.  In order to\n   support\
    \ localized routing when roaming occurs, it is required that\n   MAGs to which\
    \ the MN and CN connect be within the same provider\n   domain, and each MAG has\
    \ a security relationship with the\n   corresponding LMA, which maintains the\
    \ registration of the MN or the\n   CN, respectively.\n   According to the roaming\
    \ model as depicted in Figure 2, the MN's\n   PMIPv6 domain is characterized by\
    \ its MAG (MAG1/MAG1') and its LMA\n   (LMA1), whereas the CN's PMIPv6 domain\
    \ is characterized by the CN's\n   MAG (MAG2/MAG2') and its LMA (LMA2/LMA2').\
    \  A solution for localized\n   routing cannot take any assumption about whether\
    \ or not the MN and CN\n   share the same PMIPv6 domain; hence, MAG1/MAG1' may\
    \ not share a\n   security association with LMA2/LMA2', and MAG2/MAG2' may not\
    \ share a\n   security association with LMA1, respectively.\n   It is not required\
    \ that LMAs, which hold the registration for the MN\n   and the CN, respectively,\
    \ be part of the same provider domain as the\n   MAGs where the MN and CN attach.\
    \  When the MN's MAG and LMA belong to\n   different provider domains (A and C),\
    \ localized routing is subject to\n   policy governing the service level agreements\
    \ between these domains.\n   The same applies to the provider domains that provide\
    \ the CN's MAG\n   and LMA.  Based on the above requirements, four PMIPv6 roaming\
    \ and\n   non-roaming cases can be taken into account.\n   o  Case 1: The MN's\
    \ MAG (MAG1), the CN's MAG (MAG2), the MN's LMA\n      (LMA1), and the CN's LMA\
    \ (LMA2) are located in the same provider\n      domain A.\n   o  Case 2: The\
    \ MN's MAG (MAG1), the CN's MAG (MAG2), and the MN's LMA\n      (LMA1) are located\
    \ in the same domain A, while the CN's LMA\n      (LMA2') is located in provider\
    \ domain B.\n   o  Case 3: The MN's MAG (MAG1') and the CN's MAG (MAG2') are located\n\
    \      in domain C, while the MN's LMA (LMA1) and the CN's LMA (LMA2) are\n  \
    \    located in provider domain A.\n   o  Case 4: The MN's MAG (MAG1') and the\
    \ CN's MAG (MAG2') are located\n      in provider domain C, while the MN's LMA\
    \ (LMA1) is located in\n      provider domain A and the CN's LMA (LMA2') is located\
    \ in provider\n      domain B.\n   In these roaming cases, the MN can be allowed\
    \ to roam within its\n   domain (e.g., the MN's home domain in which the MN's\
    \ LMA is located)\n   or over different domains (e.g., the MN moves from its home\
    \ domain to\n   a visited domain).  During mobility, the CN and MN should remain\n\
    \   attached to MAGs of the same provider domain to maintain efficient\n   routing\
    \ of traffic between their MAGs.\n                                     |\n   \

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   A protocol solution for localized routing in\
    \ a PMIPv6 network must\n   counter unauthorized change of a routing path.  In\
    \ particular, the\n   control plane for localized routing must preclude the blocking\
    \ or\n   hijacking of mobile nodes' traffic by malicious or compromised\n   network\
    \ components.  A security solution must support suitable\n   mechanisms for authentication\
    \ of control plane components of the\n   localized routing functional architecture\
    \ for both roaming and\n   non-roaming scenarios.  Any possibility for Internet\
    \ hosts to\n   interfere with the localized routing procedure in a malicious manner\n\
    \   must be precluded.\n   Since network entities other than MNs and CNs perform\
    \ signaling to\n   set up localized routing, the MIPv6 return routability test\
    \ [RFC3775]\n   is not suitable to authenticate associated signaling messages\
    \ in\n   PMIPv6.  Solutions for localized routing in PMIPv6 need to mitigate,\n\
    \   or to provide sufficient defense against, possible security threats.\n   When\
    \ PMIPv6 participants are administered within the same domain,\n   infrastructure-based\
    \ authorization mechanisms, such as IPsec, may be\n   usable to protect signaling\
    \ for localized routing.\n   Existing security associations according to [RFC5213]\
    \ can be re-used\n   to protect signaling for localized routing on the interface\
    \ between a\n   MAG and an LMA.  In the case where a protocol solution for localized\n\
    \   routing in PMIPv6 relies on protocol operation between MAGs, means\n   for\
    \ protection of signaling between these MAGs must be provided.  The\n   same applies\
    \ for signaling on a possible protocol interface between\n   two LMAs of the same\
    \ domain.\n"
