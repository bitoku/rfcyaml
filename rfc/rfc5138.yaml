  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a URN (Uniform Resource Name) namespace\
    \ that\n   is engineered by the Commission for the Management and Application\
    \ of\n   Geoscience Information (CGI) for naming (i) persistent resources\n  \
    \ published by the CGI and (ii) resources published by organizations\n   that\
    \ wish them to be used in the context of services conforming to\n   protocols\
    \ and agreements issued by CGI.  The formal Namespace\n   Identifier (NID) is\
    \ \"cgi\".\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   CGI is a Commission of the International Union of Geological\
    \ Sciences\n   (IUGS) concerned with developing best practices in the management\
    \ and\n   application of geoscience information.  The active membership is\n \
    \  primarily drawn from organizations with statutory responsibility for\n   providing\
    \ geoscience information to external users (e.g., Geologic\n   Surveys).  An important\
    \ focus of activity is the development of\n   standards for networked data interchange\
    \ to complement or supersede\n   the traditional map product.\n   A number of\
    \ documents, definitions, and other artifacts, are required\n   to support this.\
    \  CGI wishes to provide persistent,\n   location-independent identifiers for\
    \ these resources.  In addition,\n   organizations that subscribe to the interchange\
    \ standards proposed by\n   CGI require external identifiers for data objects\
    \ that are\n   transferred.  CGI wishes to provide a scheme to enable data providers\n\
    \   to uniquely identify data, which is consistent with the requirements\n   of\
    \ the interchange framework.\n   Products and services that conform to CGI endorsed\
    \ interchange\n   specifications enable users to exchange and process geoscience\n\
    \   information across networks, computing platforms, and products.\n   Interoperability\
    \ in such an environment is facilitated by the use of\n   a system of identifiers\
    \ that is global in scope.  CGI is the lead\n   forum for statutory organizations\
    \ that act as primary providers of\n   technical data in this application domain.\n\
    \   Motivated by these concerns, CGI would like to assign formal URNs to\n   published\
    \ resources in order to provide persistent,\n   location-independent identifiers\
    \ for them.  The process for\n   registering a namespace identifier is documented\
    \ in [RFC3406].\n   The official IANA registry of URN namespaces is available\
    \ online at:\n   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces>\n"

    \   NG12 5GG\n      U K\n      Attn. Ian Jackson (ij@bgs.ac.uk)\n   Declaration\
    \ of syntactic structure:\n      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs\
    \ that use the \"cgi\"\n      NID has the following structure:\n      urn:cgi:{CGIResource}:{ResourceSpecificString}\n\
    \      where the \"CGIResource\" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the\n \
    \     URN syntax requirements [RFC2141] and defines a specific class of\n    \
    \  resource type.  Each resource type has a specific labeling scheme\n      that\
    \ is covered by \"ResourceSpecificString\", which also conforms\n      to the\
    \ naming requirements of [RFC2141].\n      The CGI maintains a naming authority,\
    \ the CGI Naming Authority\n      (CGINA), that manages the assignment of CGIResource\
    \ classes and\n      the specific registration values assigned for each resource\
    \ class.\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n      The CGI Naming Authority\
    \ (CGINA) provides information on the\n      registered resources and the registrations\
    \ for each.  More\n      information about CGINA and the registration activities\
    \ and\n      procedures to be followed are available at:\n      <http://www.cgi-iugs.org/CGIIdentifierScheme>\n\
    \      A URN resolver is available at:\n      <http://www.cgi-iugs.org/uri>\n\
    \      The resolver provides a registry of CGI URNs used in CGI services.\n  \
    \ Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n      The CGINA manages resources using\
    \ the \"cgi\" NID and is the\n      authority for managing the resources and subsequent\
    \ strings\n      associated.  In the associated procedures, CGINA ensures the\n\
    \      uniqueness of the strings themselves or permits secondary\n      responsibility\
    \ for management of well-defined sub-trees.\n      CGI may permit use of experimental-type\
    \ values that will not be\n      registered.  As a consequence, multiple users\
    \ may end up using the\n      same value for separate uses.  As experimental usage\
    \ is only\n      intended for testing purposes, this should not interfere with\n\
    \      operational services.\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n    \
    \  CGINA provides clear documentation of the registered uses of the\n      \"\
    cgi\" NID.  This is structured such that each CGIResource has a\n      separate\
    \ description and associated ResourceSpecificString with\n      separate registration\
    \ tables for elements of the strings that are\n      separately maintained.\n\
    \      The registration tables and information are published and\n      maintained\
    \ by CGINA on the CGI web site, indicated above.\n   Process of identifier assignment:\n\
    \      CGINA defines CGIResource classes used with the \"cgi\" NID, and\n    \
    \  specifies the process for identifier assignment for each class.\n      These\
    \ are described at:\n      <http://www.cgi-iugs.org/CGIIdentifierScheme>\n   \
    \   and a set of registers is linked from there.  Each such resource\n      may\
    \ have three types of registration activities:\n         1) Registered values\
    \ associated with CGI resources\n         2) Registration of values or sub-trees\
    \ to other entities\n         3) Name models for use in experimental purposes\n\
    \   Process for Identifier Resolution:\n      The namespace is not listed with\
    \ a Resolution Discovery System\n      (RDS); this is not relevant.\n   Rules\
    \ for Lexical Equivalence:\n      No special considerations; the rules for lexical\
    \ equivalence of\n      [RFC2141] apply.\n   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n  \
    \    No special considerations.\n   Validation mechanism:\n      None specified.\
    \  URN assignment will be handled by procedures\n      implemented in support\
    \ of CGINA activities.\n   Scope:\n      Global\n"

- title: 4.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Namespace Considerations\n   There is currently no available namespace that\
    \ will allow the CGI to\n   uniquely specify and access resources, such as schemas\
    \ and\n   registries, that are required by organizations implementing CGI\n  \
    \ standards.  There is also a need for other standards organizations,\n   such\
    \ as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) to be able to access\n   CGI-specific\
    \ resources.\n   The CGI members considered use of other existing NIDs, such as\
    \ those\n   for OGC.  However, these do not support the semantics required and\
    \ in\n   particular do not allow for the delegation of identifier assignment\n\
    \   within the CGI community that is demonstrated here.\n"
- title: 5.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Community Considerations\n   CGI standards require access to resources, such\
    \ as schemas,\n   registries, catalogues, documents, and services.  In order for\
    \ the\n   larger IT community to be able to implement applications that access\n\
    \   CGI resources effectively, a unique namespace is required.  We desire\n  \
    \ these resources to be freely and openly available as a set of\n   community\
    \ resources.\n   The design of the CGI namespace builds on the experience of the\
    \ Open\n   Geospatial Consortium (OGC) which has defined the framework of\n  \
    \ geospatial services within which CGI standards have been developed.\n   The\
    \ OGC membership has expertise in using the OGC URN [OGC-URN]\n   [OGC-DEF], gained\
    \ through implementation experiments and a variety of\n   operational testbeds.\
    \  The CGI namespace is compatible with this\n   experience.\n"
