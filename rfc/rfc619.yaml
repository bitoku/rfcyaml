  - "                  Mean Round-Trip Times in the ARPANET\nIn one of our current\
    \ measurement projects we are interested in the\naverage values of important network\
    \ parameters.  For this purpose we\ncollect data on the network activity over\
    \ seven consecutive days.  This\ndata collection is only interrupted by down-time\
    \ or maintenance of\neither the net or our collecting facility (the \"late\" Sigma-7\
    \ or, in\nfuture, the 360/91 at CCN).\nThe insight gained from the analysis of\
    \ this data has been reported in\nNetwork Measurement Group Note 18 (NIC 20793):\n\
    \    L.  Kleinrock and W. Naylor\n    \"On Measured Behavior of the ARPA Network\"\
    \nThis paper will be presented at the NCC '74 in Chicago.\nIn this RFC we want\
    \ to report the mean round-trip times (or delays) that\nwere observed during these\
    \ week-long measurements since we think these\nfigures are of general interest\
    \ to the ARPA community.  Let us first\ndefine the term \"round trip time\" as\
    \ it is used by the statistics\ngathering program in the IMPs.  When a message\
    \ is sent from a source\nHOST to a destination HOST, the following events, among\
    \ others, can be\ndistinguished (T(i) is the time of event i):\n  T(1): The message\
    \ is passed from the user program to the NCP in the\n        source HOST\n  T(2):\
    \ The proper entry is made in the pending packet table (PPT) for\n        single\
    \ packet messages or the pending leader table (PLT) for\n        multiple packet\
    \ messages after the first packet is received by\n        the source IMP\n  T(3):\
    \ The first packet of the message is put on the proper output\n        queue in\
    \ the source IMP (at this time the input of the second\n        packet is initiated)\n\
    \  T(4): The message is put on the HOST-output queue in the destination\n    \
    \    IMP (at this time the reassembly of the message is complete)\n  T(5): The\
    \ RFNM is sent from the destination IMP to the source IMP\n  T(6): The RFNM arrives\
    \ at the source IMP\n  T(7): The RFNM is accepted by the source HOST\nThe time\
    \ intervals T(i)-T(i-1) are mainly due to the following delays\nand waiting times:\n\
    \  T(2)-T(1): -HOST processing delay\n             -HOST-IMP transmission delay\
    \ for the 32-bit leader\n             -Waiting time for a message number to become\
    \ free (only\n              four messages can simultaneously be transmitted between\n\
    \              any pair of source IMP - destination IMP)\n             -Waiting\
    \ time for a buffer to become free (there must be\n              more than three\
    \ buffers on the \"free buffer list\")\n             -HOST-IMP transmission delay\
    \ for the first packet\n             -Waiting time for an entry in the PPT or\
    \ PLT to become\n              available (there are eight entries in the PPT and\
    \ twelve\n              in the PLT table)\n  T(3)-T(2): -Waiting time for a store-and-forward\
    \ (S/F) buffer to\n              become free (the maximum number of S/F-buffers\
    \ is 20).\n             -Waiting time for a logical ACK-channel to become free\n\
    \              (there are 8 logical ACK-channels for each physical\n         \
    \     channel).\n             -For multiple packet messages, waiting time until\
    \ the\n              ALLOCATE is received (unless an allocation from a previous\n\
    \              multiple-packet message still exists; such an allocation\n    \
    \          is returned in the RFNM and expires after 125 msec)\n  T(4)-T(3): -Queuing\
    \ delay, transmission delay, and propagation delay\n              in all the IMPs\
    \ and lines in the path from source IMP to\n              destination IMP\n  \
    \           -Possibly retransmission delay due to transmission errors\n      \
    \        or lack of buffer space (for multiple packet messages the\n         \
    \     delays for the individual packets overlap)\n  T(5)-T(4): -Queuing delay\
    \ in the destination IMP\n             -IMP-HOST transmission delay for the first\
    \ packet\n             -For multiple-packet messages, waiting time for reassembly\n\
    \              buffers to become free to piggy-back an ALLOCATE on the\n     \
    \         RFNM (if this waiting time exceeds one second then the\n           \
    \   RFNM is sent without the ALLOCATE)\n  T(6)-T(5): -Queuing delay, transmission\
    \ delay, and propagation delay\n              for the RFNM in all the IMPs and\
    \ lines in the path from\n              destination IMP to source IMP\n  T(7)-T(6):\
    \ -Queuing delay for the RFNM in the source IMP\n             -IMP-HOST transmission\
    \ delay for the RFNM\nIMP processing delays are not included in this table since\
    \ they are\nusually very small.  Also, some of the abovementioned waiting times\n\
    reduce to zero in many cases, e.g. the waiting time for a message number\nto become\
    \ available and the waiting time for a buffer to become free.\nIf the source and\
    \ destination HOSTs are attached to the same IMP, this\ntable can be simplified\
    \ as follows:\n  T(2)-T(1):  as before\n  T(3)-T(2):  for multiple packet messages:\
    \ waiting time until\n              reassembly space becomes available (there\
    \ are up to 66\n              reassembly buffers)\n  T(4)-T(3):  for multiple\
    \ packet messages: HOST-IMP transmission delay\n              for packets 2,3,...\n\
    \  T(5)-T(4):  as before\n  T(6)-T(5):  0\n  T(7)-T(6):  as before\nUp to now\
    \ we have neglected the possibility that a single packet message\nis rejected\
    \ at the destination IMP because of lack of reassembly space.\nIf this occurs,\
    \ the single packet message is treated as a request for\nbuffer space allocation\
    \ and the time interval T(3)-T(2) increased by the\nwaiting time until the corresponding\
    \ \"ALLOCATE\" is received.\nThe round trip time (RTT) is now defined as the time\
    \ interval T(6)-T(2).\nNote that the RTT for multiple packet messages does include\
    \ the waiting\ntime until the ALLOCATE is received.  It does, however, not include\
    \ the\nsource HOST processing delay (i.e. delays in the NCP), the HOST-IMP\ntransmission\
    \ delay, and the waiting time until a message number becomes\navailable.  Note\
    \ also, that the RFNM is sent after the first packet of a\nmultiple packet message\
    \ has been received by the destination HOST.\nLet us now turn to the presentation\
    \ of the average round trip times as\nthey were measured during continuous seven-day\
    \ periods in August and\nDecember '73.  In August, an average number of 2935 messages/minute\
    \ were\nentering the ARPANET.  The overall mean round trip delay for all these\n\
    messages was 93 milliseconds (msec).  The corresponding numbers for\nDecember\
    \ were 2226 messages/minute and 200 msec.  An obvious question\nthat immediately\
    \ arises is: why did the average round trip delay more\nthan double while the\
    \ rate of incoming messages decreased?  The answer\nto this question can be found\
    \ in the large round trip delays for the\nstatus reports that are sent from each\
    \ IMP to the NCC.  Each IMP sends,\non the average, 2.29 status reports per minute\
    \ to the NCC.  Since there\nwere 45 sites connected to the net in December, a\
    \ total of 103.05 status\nreports per minute were sent to the NCC.  Thus 4.63\
    \ percent of all\nmessages that entered the net were status reports.\nThe average\
    \ round trip delay for all these status reports in December\nwas 1.66 sec.  This\
    \ number is five to ten times larger than the average\nround-trip delay for status\
    \ reports we observed in August.  It is not\nyet clear what change in the collection\
    \ of status reports caused this\nincrease.  One reason appears to be that the\
    \ number of these reports was\ndoubled between August and December.  Since the\
    \ large round-trip delays\nof these status reports distort the overall picture\
    \ somewhat, we are\ngoing to present the December data - wherever appropriate\
    \ - with and\nwithout the effect of these delays.  (We should point out here that\
    \ the\ntraffic/delay picture is distorted by the accumulated statistics\nmessages\
    \ which were collected to produce this data.  We have, however,\nignored this\
    \ effect since these measurement messages represent less than\n0.3% of the total\
    \ traffic.)  The overall mean round trip delay without\nthe status reports in\
    \ December is 132 msec.  This value is still more\nthan 35 msec larger than the\
    \ corresponding value for August.  However,\nbefore we shall attempt to explain\
    \ this difference we will first present\nthe measured data.\nTable 1 shows the\
    \ mean round trip delay as a function of the number of\nhops over the minimum-hop\
    \ path.  This minimum number of hops was\ncalculated from the (static) topology\
    \ of the net as it existed in August\nand December of last year.  The actual number\
    \ of hops over which any\ngiven message travels may, of course, be larger due\
    \ to network\ncongestion, line failures or IMP failures.  In fact, for August\
    \ we\nobserved a minimum mean path length of 3.24 while the actual measured\n\
    mean path length was 3.30; in December we observed 4.02 and 4.40,\nrespectively.\
    \  (See Network Measurement Group Note #18 for an\nexplanation of the computation\
    \ of actual mean path length.)  As expected\nwe observe a sharp increase of the\
    \ mean round trip delay as the minimum\nnumber of hops is increased.  Note, however,\
    \ that the mean round trip\ndelay is not a strictly increasing function of the\
    \ minimum number of\nhops.\nTable 2 gives the mean round trip delay for messages\
    \ from a given site.\nThe December data is presented with and without the large\
    \ delays\nincurred by the sending of status reports to the NCC.  Table 3 shows\
    \ the\nmean round trip delay for messages to a given site.  The largest round\n\
    trip delays, in December, were incurred by messages sent to the NCC-TIP\nsince\
    \ these messages include all the status reports.\nTable 4, finally, gives for\
    \ each site the mean round trip delays to\nthose three destination IMP/TIP's to\
    \ which the most messages were sent\nduring the seven-day measurement period in\
    \ December.  Let us first say\nfew words about the traffic distribution which\
    \ is dealt with in more\ndetail in Network Measurement Group Note #18.  There\
    \ are several sites\nwhich like to use their IMP as a kind of local multiplexer\
    \ (UTAH, MIT,\nHARV, CMU, USCT, CCAT, XROX, HAWT, MIT2).  For these sites the\
    \ most\nfavorite destination site is the source IMP itself.  For several other\n\
    sites the most favorite destination site is just one hop away (BBN,\nAMES, AMST,\
    \ NCCT,  RUTT).  Nobody will be surprised that for many sites\nISI (ILL, MTRT,\
    \ ETAT, SDAT, ARPT, RMLT, LONT) or SRI (UCSB, RADT, NBST)\nis the most favorite\
    \ site.  There are several other sites (SDC, LL,\nCASE, DOCT, BELV, ABRD, FNWT,\
    \ LBL, NSAT, TYMT, MOFF, WPAT) which were\nrather inactive in terms of generating\
    \ traffic during the seven-day\nmeasurement period in December.  Most of their\
    \ messages were status\nreports sent to the NCC.  (Those IMPs, for which the frequency\
    \ of\nmessages to the NCC-TIP is less than 2.2 messages per minute, were down\n\
    for some time during the measurement period).\nLet us now attempt to give a few\
    \ explanations for the overall increase\nin the mean round trip delay between\
    \ August and December.  These\nexplanations may also help to understand the differences\
    \ in the mean\nround trip delays for any given source IMP-destination IMP pair\
    \ as\nobserved in Table 4.\n1.  Frequency of routing messages.  Routing messages\
    \ are the major\n    source of queuing delay in a very lightly loaded net.  In\
    \ August, a\n    routing message was sent every 640 msec.  Since a routing message\
    \ is\n    1160 bits long, 3.625 percent of the bandwidth of a 50 kbs circuit\n\
    \    was used for the sending of routing messages.  For randomly arriving\n  \
    \  packets this corresponds to a mean queuing delay of 0.42 msec per\n    hop.\
    \  Between August and December the frequency of sending routing\n    messages\
    \ was made dependent on line speed and line utilization.  As\n    a result, routing\
    \ messages are now sent on a 50 kbs circuit with\n    zero load every 128 msec.\
    \  This corresponds to a line utilization of\n    18.125 percent and a mean queuing\
    \ delay of 2.10 msec.  The queuing\n    delay due to routing messages in a very\
    \ lightly loaded net in\n    December was therefore five times as large as it\
    \ was in August.\n2.  Traffic matrix.  The overall mean round trip delay depends\
    \ on the\n    traffic matrix.  If most of the messages are sent over distances\
    \ of\n    0 or 1 hop the overall round trip delay will be small.  The heavy\n\
    \    traffic between AMES and AMST over a high-speed circuit in August\n    contributed\
    \ to the small overall mean round trip delay.\n3.  Network topology.  The mean\
    \ round trip delay depends on the number\n    of hops between source-IMP and destination-IMP\
    \ and therefore on the\n    network topology.  Disregarding line or IMP failures,\
    \ the mean\n    number of hops for a message in August and December was,\n   \
    \ respectively, 3.24 and 4.02.\n4.  Averaging.  The network load, given in number\
    \ or messages per\n    minute, represents an average over a seven-day period.\
    \  Even though\n    this number may be small, considerable queuing delays could\
    \ have\n    been incurred during bursts of traffic.\n5.  Host delays.  The round\
    \ trip delay includes the transmission delay\n    of the first packet from the\
    \ destination-IMP to the destination-\n    HOST; therefore, the mean round trip\
    \ delay may be influenced by HOST\n    delays that are independent of the network\
    \ load.\n                   Table 1 Mean Round Trip Delay as a\n             \
