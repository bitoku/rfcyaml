  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information\
    \ Base (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n\
    \   A separate memo [16] defines managed objects, in a manner independent\n  \
    \ of the type of network, for controlling the selection, collection and\n   storage\
    \ of accounting information into files for later retrieval via\n   a file transfer\
    \ protocol. This memo defines a set of ATM-specific\n   accounting information\
    \ which can be collected for connections on ATM\n   networks.\n"
- title: 2.  The SNMP Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  The SNMP Network Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently\
    \ consists of five major\n   components:\n   o    An overall architecture, described\
    \ in RFC 2271 [1].\n   o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events\
    \ for the\n        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure\
    \ of\n        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in\n\
    \        STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].\n      \
    \  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5],\n        RFC\
    \ 1903 [6] and RFC 1904 [7].\n   o    Message protocols for transferring management\
    \ information.  The\n        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called\
    \ SNMPv1 and\n        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second version of\
    \ the SNMP\n        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track\n\
    \        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and\n     \
    \   RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is\n        called\
    \ SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and\n        RFC 2274 [12].\n\
    \   o    Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The\n    \
    \    first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is\n        described\
    \ in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second set of protocol\n        operations and associated\
    \ PDU formats is described in RFC 1905\n        [13].\n   o    A set of fundamental\
    \ applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and\n        the view-based access control\
    \ mechanism described in RFC 2275\n        [15].\n   Managed objects are accessed\
    \ via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base\
    \ or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n   defined using the mechanisms defined in\
    \ the SMI.\n   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.\
    \  A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate\n\
    \   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically\n   equivalent,\
    \ except where objects or events are omitted because no\n   translation is possible\
    \ (e.g., use of Counter64).  Some machine\n   readable information in SMIv2 will\
    \ be converted into textual\n   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.\
    \  However, this\n   loss of machine readable information is not considered to\
    \ change the\n   semantics of the MIB.\n"
- title: 3.  Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview\n   In [16], the items of accounting data to be collected are specified\n\
    \   as a set of objects.  Which objects are contained in such a set is\n   selectable\
    \ by an administrator through the specification of one or\n   more (subtree, list)\
    \ tuples, where the set of objects to be collected\n   is the union of the subsets\
    \ specified by each tuple:\n       'subtree' specifies a OBJECT IDENTIFIER value\
    \ such that every\n           object in the subset is named by the subtree's value\
    \ appended\n           with a single additional sub-identifier.\n       'list'\
    \ specifies an OCTET STRING value, such that if the N-th bit\n           of the\
    \ string's value is set then the the subset contains the\n           object named\
    \ by appending N as a single additional sub-\n           identifier to the subtree.\n\
    \   This memo specifies such a subtree containing a set of objects\n   defining\
    \ items of accounting information which are applicable to ATM\n   connections.\n\
    \   Note that all of the objects defined here have a MAX-ACCESS clause of\n  \
    \ not-accessible, since their purpose is not to be read/written by\n   SNMP, but\
    \ rather, to be the syntax and semantics of the set of\n   information which can\
    \ be represented within a single (subtree, list)\n   tuple.\n"
