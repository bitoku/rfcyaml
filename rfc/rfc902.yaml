  - "Status of this Memo\n   This memo is a policy statement on how protocols become\
    \ official\n   standards for the ARPA-Internet and the DARPA research community.\n\
    \   This is an official policy statement of the ICCB and the DARPA.\n   Distribution\

- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   The purpose of this memo is to explain how protocol standards\
    \ are\n   adopted for the ARPA-Internet and the DARPA research community.\n  \
    \ There are three important aspects to be discussed:  the process, the\n   authority,\
    \ and the complex relationship between the DARPA community\n   and the DDN community.\
    \  To do this some background must be given and\n   some of the players described.\n\
    \      DARPA = Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\n      DDN   = Defense\
    \ Data Network\n"
- title: The DARPA World
  contents:
  - "The DARPA World\n   The DARPA world is headed up by the DARPA office.  DARPA\
    \ sponsors\n   research on many subjects with a number of contractors.  This set\
    \ of\n   contractors is called the \"DARPA research community\".  DARPA\n   typically\
    \ casts its research efforts into \"programs\" that involve\n   work by several\
    \ contractors.  One program is the \"Internet Program\",\n   which is researching\
    \ computer communications issues and constructing\n   experimental communication\
    \ systems.  When the experiments are\n   successful, the results are often put\
    \ into use to support further\n   work in the Internet Program and other DARPA\
    \ research programs.  In\n   this way, DARPA developed the ARPANET, SATNET, Packet\
    \ Radio Networks,\n   and the Internet.\n   In 1981 DARPA established the Internet\
    \ Configuration Control Board\n   (ICCB) to help manage the DARPA Internet Program.\n"

  contents:
  - "The ICCB\n   The concerns of the ICCB fall into two categories:\n      Short\
    \ Term Issues:\n         Keeping the Internet operating as an on-going resource,\
    \ i.e.,\n         dealing with problems that arise due to the growth in the size\n\
    \         of the system and the level of use of the system.  Sometimes\n     \
    \    this suggests research on new procedures and algorithms, or\n         suggests\
    \ changes to the existing protocols and procedures.\n         Sometimes the results\
    \ of long range research become available\n         and their introduction into\
    \ the current system becomes a short\n         term concern.\n      Long Term\
    \ Issues:\n         The ICCB also considers communication problems related to\
    \ the\n         Internet more abstractly.  The ICCB suggests to DARPA possible\n\
    \         research topics and experiments.  The ICCB may act as a\n         sounding\
    \ board for ideas suggested by others.\n   DARPA has delegated some aspects of\
    \ the management of the Internet\n   Program and operation of the (experimental)\
    \ ARPA-Internet for the\n   DARPA research community to the ICCB.\n   The members\
    \ of ICCB were chosen to represent a spectrum of interests\n   and viewpoints.\
    \  The ICCB members are from different organizations,\n   their individual backgrounds\
    \ specialize in different operating\n   systems and their viewpoints on computer\
    \ communication issues are\n   diverse.\n   The chairman of the ICCB is also the\
    \ \"Internet Architect\", and the\n   assistant chairman is the \"Deputy Internet\
    \ Architect\".  The ICCB\n   currently has 12 members. The Internet Architect\
    \ is Dave Clark of\n   MIT, and the Deputy Internet Architect is Jon Postel of\

    \  It\n   integrates many networks and communication systems now used and\n  \
    \ planned within the DoD.  One part of the DDN system is networks that\n   are\
    \ also part of the Internet, specifically MILNET and the networks\n   connected\
    \ to it.\n   The DDN is managed by the DDN Program Management Office (DDN-PMO).\n\
    \   The DDN-PMO sets policy for the use of DDN facilities and enforces\n   protocol\
    \ standards established for use in the DDN networks.\n"

  - "DARPA Internet Protocol Policy\n   Within the DoD, there are three protocol committees:\
    \ the Protocol\n   Standard Steering Group (PSSG), the Protocol Standard Technical\
    \ Panel\n   (PSTP), and the Protocol Configuration Control Board (PCCB).  These\n\
    \   committees have members that represent most elements of the DoD.\n   Generally,\
    \ they develop and recommend guidelines for protocol\n   standardization and usage\
    \ to the DDN-PMO, and to all of the DoD.  The\n   PSSG is a policy setting committee\
    \ for all of DoD on matters of\n   protocols standards.\n"
- title: The Relationship between the DARPA World and the DDN World
  contents:
  - "The Relationship between the DARPA World and the DDN World\n   There is cooperation\
    \ between DDN-PMO and DARPA about the Internet.  A\n   few people serve on both\
    \ the DoD committees (PSSG, PSTP, or PCCB) and\n   the DARPA committee (ICCB).\
    \  There are good working relationships\n   between the key people in the DARPA\
    \ office and the DDN-PMO, and\n   between the technical people in both worlds\
    \ at lower levels.\n   For example, the ICCB may decide that a certain protocol\
    \ is to be\n   used in the ARPA-Internet, and develop an implementation plan and\n\
    \   schedule.  The DDN-PMO would separately consider the issue.  It may\n   decide\
    \ to require that protocol to be implemented in DDN on the same\n   schedule,\
    \ or it may decide to wait for some results from the DARPA\n   experiment with\
    \ that protocol before committing to a schedule, or it\n   may decide that that\
    \ protocol is not required in the DDN.\n   There are two documents that specify\
    \ TCP.  RFC-793 is the official\n   specification of the DARPA research community.\
    \  Military Standard\n   1778 is the official specification of the DDN community.\
    \  The two\n   documents specify the same protocol.\n   Organizations that are\
    \ connected to the Internet through authority\n   derived from DARPA follow the\
    \ rules set by the ICCB and DARPA.\n   Organizations that are connected to the\
    \ Internet through authority\n   derived from DDN-PMO follow the rules set by\
    \ the DDN-PMO.\n"
- title: DARPA Official Protocol Designation
  contents:
  - "DARPA Official Protocol Designation\n   Official protocols for the ARPA-Internet\

    \ designation indicated in\n   the first few paragraphs of the defining RFC. \
    \ That is, the RFC\n   defining an official protocol should have a policy statement\
    \ that\n   says,\n      \"This RFC specifies a standard for the DARPA community.\
    \  Hosts on\n      the ARPA-Internet are expected to adopt and implement this\n\

  - "The Normal Development of an DARPA Protocol Standard\n   There probably never\
    \ has been a \"normal\" case.  In most instances\n   some exception or another\
    \ has been made to the following procedure.\n   The Typical Chain of Events\n\
    \      The development of a protocol starts with some discussion with\n      random\
    \ people in messages and meetings over an idea of a new\n      protocol and the\
    \ form it ought to take.\n      Someone writes a draft and proposes this draft\
    \ to a group of\n      people who are interested in the problem.  They suggest\
    \ revisions\n      and iterate the discussion.  Eventually, they may decide that\
    \ they\n      have a reasonable definition of the new protocol and then pass\n\
    \      this definition on to the RFC Editor.\n      The next step is that the\
    \ RFC Editor sends a draft to other people\n      who might also be interested\
    \ in the problem.  These people can\n      number just a few, or be part of a\
    \ large mailing list.  Depending\n      upon the results from this selected informal\
    \ group, the draft can\n      be revised and rewritten several times.\n      When\
    \ this process stabilizes, the protocol draft is sent out as an\n      RFC, identified\
    \ as a draft proposal of a protocol that may become\n      an official protocol.\
    \  The RFC is sent to the ARPA-Internet world\n      at large.\n      After a\
    \ certain amount of time, if only a few comments are sent\n      back, some people\
    \ may try to implement the draft protocol.\n      Test implementation of a protocol\
    \ is a difficult management issue.\n"

  - "DARPA Internet Protocol Policy\n      Experiments must be done with a small number\
    \ of participants due\n      to the difficulty in changing many implementations\
    \ at the same\n      time if changes in the protocol are necessary.\n        \
    \ In cases where the ICCB deems it necessary, a set of test\n         implementations\
    \ will be done.  A few participants are picked\n         (typically 5 or fewer)\
    \ for such experiments.  This may lead to\n         revision of the protocol before\
    \ further implementations are\n         encouraged or before the protocol is made\
    \ official.\n      If no problems arise, a new RFC is issued containing the complete\n\
    \      definition of the protocol, and that the protocol is an official\n    \
    \  protocol of the ARPA-Internet and DARPA research community.\n   In general,\
    \ lower level protocols are more critically judged than\n   higher level protocols\
    \ (for example, a protocol like TCP would be\n   subject to more careful study\
    \ than an application like the DAYTIME\n   protocol).\n"
- title: The Bottom Line
  contents:
  - "The Bottom Line\n   For the ARPA-Internet and the DARPA research community, DARPA\
    \ is in\n   charge.  DARPA delegates the authority for protocol standards to the\n\
    \   ICCB.  The ICCB delegates the actual administration of the protocol\n   standards\
    \ to the Deputy Internet Architect.\n   For the DoD in general, the PSSG is in\
    \ charge.  The PSSG delegates\n   the authority for the day to day management\
    \ of protocol standards in\n   the DDN to the DDN-PMO.\n"
