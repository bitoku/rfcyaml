- title: INTRODUCTION
  contents:
  - "INTRODUCTION\n   This document defines the basic components of a Network Standard\
    \ Data\n   Specification (NSDS) syntax.  A NSDS is intended to provide a\n   mechanism\
    \ for specifying all the attributes of a collection of bits.\n      The definition\
    \ of a complete NSDS syntax is expected to require an\n      extended effort.\
    \  Therefore the initial scope of this document has\n      been constrained to\
    \ provide only a basic syntactic environment.\n   In order to demonstrate a specific\
    \ use for the NSDS, this document\n   also provides the complete syntax for specifying\
    \ the PATHNAME\n   attributes of a collection of bits, to the level of a file.\
    \  Addition\n   of new subparamters should not be difficult.\n      In this context,\
    \ \"pathname\" referes to that information which\n      specifies the LOCATION\
    \ of a collection of bits.\n      The pathname syntax is essentially the same\
    \ as that proposed in\n      RFC 615 (NIC -- 21531,).  Modifications were made\
    \ in order to\n      allow for graceful addition of other file attributes and\
    \ to\n      optimize use by humans and by processes.\n   I would like to thank\
    \ Jon Postel, Jerry Popek, Vint Cerf, Jim White,\n   Charlie Kline, Buz Owen,\
    \ Ken Pogran, Jerry Burchfiel and Tom Boynton\n   for their suggestions.\n"
- title: HUMAN AND MACHINE FACTORS
  contents:
  - "HUMAN AND MACHINE FACTORS\n   Since computers tend to prefer more highly structured\
    \ envireonments\n   than do humans, aspects of the NSDS syntax are permitted to\
    \ be\n   different for computers than they are for humans.  Specifically:\n  \
    \    For computers (highly-structured mode), keyword fields are fixed\n      length\
    \ and the variable-length data subfields are prefaced by a\n      byte count.\
    \  Additionally in highly structured mode, the possible\n      contents of data\
    \ subfields may be more constrained than for the\n      semi-structured mode.\n\
    \      For humans (semi-structured mode), keyword subfields are variable\n   \
    \   length and data subfields are surrounded by delimeter characters.\n      A\
    \ keyword must be long enough to distinguish it from other\n      keywords.  That\
    \ is, partial-name specification is permitted.\n"

    \   indicates semi-structured syntax, two indicate that highly-structured\n  \
    \ syntax is being used.\n      Only <flag> must be considered in relation to any\
    \ host's current\n      syntax.  It is not currently known to conflict with any\
    \ host's\n      syntax.\n         Exclamation mark (!) is the only other character\
    \ that seems\n         permissible (on the assumption that the character should\
    \ be a\n         graphic).  Its use would cause minor problems at Multics; but\n\
    \         more importantly as a graphic, it is too similar to the numeral\n  \
    \       \"1\".\n   The basic (highest-level) syntax for individual <path> and\n\
    \   <otherstuff> fields is the same, as defined below.  The remaining\n   lower-level\
    \ syntax (including permissible keywords and data subfield\n   contents) for <otherstuff>\
    \ fields is left for later.\n"

    \ omitted.  The order is as indicated for <key>s, below. That is,\n   Network,\
    \ Host, ... Siteparm.\n      Keywords are used, even though pathname attributes\
    \ are ordered, to\n      facilitate the addition of new fields and to be consistent\

    \    unordered.\n   <Field>s or <h-rest> subfields may be repeated, as permitted\

    \   subfields is interpreted as a series of <h-field>s with identical\n   <key>s.\n\
    \      Also, note that since the syntax does not constrain the contents\n    \
    \  of <data> subfields, compound names within a single <data>\n      subfield\
    \ are allowed.  The delimeter used to separate names within\n      a <data> subfield\
