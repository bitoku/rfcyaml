  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information\
    \ Base (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n\
    \   In particular, it describes managed objects which provide an inverted\n  \
    \ mapping of the interface stack table used for managing network\n   interfaces.\n"
- title: 2.  The SNMP Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  The SNMP Network Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently\
    \ consists of five major\n   components:\n    o An overall architecture, described\
    \ in RFC 2571 [1].\n    o Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events\
    \ for the\n      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of\n\
    \      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD\n   \
    \   16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].  The\n      second\
    \ version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, which\n      consists of RFC\
    \ 2578 [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].\n    o Message protocols for transferring\
    \ management information.  The\n      first version of the SNMP message protocol\
    \ is called SNMPv1 and\n      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second version\
    \ of the SNMP\n      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track\n\
    \      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC\n   \
    \   1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is called\n      SNMPv3\
    \ and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574\n      [12].\n  \
    \  o Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The\n      first\
    \ set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is\n      described in\
    \ STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second set of protocol\n      operations and associated\
    \ PDU formats is described in RFC 1905\n      [13].\n    o A set of fundamental\
    \ applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and\n      the view-based access control\
    \ mechanism described in RFC 2575\n      [15].\n   A more detailed introduction\
    \ to the current SNMP Management Framework\n   can be found in RFC 2570 [18].\n\
    \   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the\
    \ Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n   defined using\
    \ the mechanisms defined in the SMI.\n   This memo specifies a MIB module that\
    \ is compliant to the SMIv2.  A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced\
    \ through the appropriate\n   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must\
    \ be semantically\n   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because\
    \ no\n   translation is possible (e.g., use of Counter64).  Some machine\n   readable\
    \ information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual\n   descriptions in SMIv1\
    \ during the translation process.  However, this\n   loss of machine readable\
    \ information is not considered to change the\n   semantics of the MIB.\n"
- title: 3.  Interface Sub-Layers and the ifStackTable
  contents:
  - "3.  Interface Sub-Layers and the ifStackTable\n   MIB-II [16] defines objects\
    \ for managing network interfaces by\n   providing a generic interface definition\
    \ together with the ability to\n   define media-specific extensions.  The generic\
    \ objects are known as\n   the 'interfaces' group.\n   Experience in defining\
    \ media-specific extensions showed the need to\n   distinguish between the multiple\
    \ sub-layers beneath the\n   internetwork-layer.  Consider, for example, an interface\
    \ with PPP\n   running over an HDLC link which uses a RS232-like connector.  Each\
    \ of\n   these sub-layers has its own media-specific MIB module.\n   The latest\
    \ definition of the 'interfaces' group in the IF-MIB [17]\n   satisfies this need\
    \ by having each sub-layer be represented by its\n   own conceptual row in the\
    \ ifTable.  It also defines an additional MIB\n   table, the ifStackTable, to\
    \ identify the \"superior\" and \"subordinate\"\n   sub-layers through ifIndex\
    \ \"pointers\" to the appropriate conceptual\n   rows in the ifTable.\n   Each\
    \ conceptual row in the ifStackTable represents a relationship\n   between two\
    \ interfaces, where this relationship is that the \"higher-\n   layer\" interface\
    \ runs \"on top\" of the \"lower-layer\" interface.  For\n   example, if a PPP\
    \ module operated directly over a serial interface,\n   the PPP module would be\
    \ a \"higher layer\" to the serial interface, and\n   the serial interface would\
    \ be a \"lower layer\" to the PPP module.\n   This concept of \"higher-layer\"\
    \ and \"lower-layer\" is the same as\n   embodied in the definitions of the ifTable's\
    \ packet counters.\n   The ifStackTable is INDEX-ed by the ifIndex values of the\
    \ two\n   interfaces involved in the relationship.  By necessity, one of these\n\
    \   ifIndex values must come first, and the IF-MIB chose to have the\n   higher-layer\
    \ interface first, and the lower-layer interface second.\n   Due to this, it is\
    \ straight-forward for a Network Management\n   application to read a subset of\
    \ the ifStackTable and thereby\n   determine the interfaces which run underneath\
    \ a particular interface.\n   However, to determine which interfaces run on top\
    \ of a particular\n   interface, a Network Management application has no alternative\
    \ but to\n   read the whole table.  This is very inefficient when querying a\n\
    \   device which has many interfaces, and many conceptual rows in its\n   ifStackTable.\n\
    \   This MIB provides an inverted Interfaces Stack Table, the\n   ifInvStackTable.\
    \  While it contains no additional information beyond\n   that already contained\
    \ in the ifStackTable, the ifInvStackTable has\n   the ifIndex values in its INDEX\
    \ clause in the reverse order, i.e.,\n   the lower-layer interface first, and\
    \ the higher-layer interface\n   second.  As a result, the ifInvStackTable is\
    \ an inverted version of\n   the same information contained in the ifStackTable.\
    \  Thus, the\n   ifInvStackTable provides an efficient means for a Network Management\n\
    \   application to read a subset of the ifStackTable and thereby\n   determine\
    \ which interfaces run on top of a particular interface.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   There are no management objects defined in this\
    \ MIB that have a MAX-\n   ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So,\
    \ if this MIB is\n   implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder\
    \ can\n   alter or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP\n\
    \   SET operations.\n   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if\
    \ the network\n   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there\
    \ is no\n   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and\n\
    \   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.\n   It is recommended\
    \ that the implementers consider the security\n   features as provided by the\
    \ SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use\n   of the User-based Security Model\
    \ RFC 2574 [12] and the View- based\n   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is\
    \ recommended.\n   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the\
    \ SNMP\n   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly\n   configured\
    \ to give access to the objects only to those principals\n   (users) that have\
    \ legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET\n   (change/create/delete) them.\n"
