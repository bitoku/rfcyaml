  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] and the\n\
    \   Authentication Header (AH) [RFC4302] are the mechanisms for applying\n   cryptographic\
    \ protection to data being sent over an IPsec Security\n   Association (SA) [RFC4301].\n\
    \   This document provides guidance and recommendations so that ESP and\n   AH\
    \ can be used with cryptographic algorithms that are up to date.\n   The challenge\
    \ of such documents is making sure that, over time, IPsec\n   implementations\
    \ can use secure and up-to-date cryptographic\n   algorithms while keeping IPsec\
    \ interoperable.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Updating Algorithm Implementation Requirements and Usage Guidance\n   The\
    \ field of cryptography evolves continuously: new, stronger\n   algorithms appear,\
    \ and existing algorithms are found to be less\n   secure than originally thought.\
    \  Therefore, algorithm implementation\n   requirements and usage guidance need\
    \ to be updated from time to time\n   to reflect the new reality.  The choices\
    \ for algorithms must be\n   conservative to minimize the risk of algorithm compromise.\n\
    \   Algorithms need to be suitable for a wide variety of CPU\n   architectures\
    \ and device deployments ranging from high-end bulk\n   encryption devices to\
    \ small, low-power Internet of Things (IoT)\n   devices.\n   The algorithm implementation\
    \ requirements and usage guidance may need\n   to change over time to adapt to\
    \ the changing world.  For this reason,\n   the selection of mandatory-to-implement\
    \ algorithms was removed from\n   the main Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version\
    \ 2 (IKEv2)\n   specification [RFC7296] and placed in a separate document.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Updating Algorithm Requirement Levels
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Updating Algorithm Requirement Levels\n   The mandatory-to-implement algorithm\
    \ of tomorrow should already be\n   available in most implementations of AH/ESP\
    \ by the time it is made\n   mandatory.  This document attempts to identify and\
    \ introduce those\n   algorithms for future mandatory-to-implement status.  There\
    \ is no\n   guarantee that the algorithms in use today may become mandatory in\n\
    \   the future.  Published algorithms are continuously subjected to\n   cryptographic\
    \ attack and may become too weak or could become\n   completely broken before\
    \ this document is updated.\n   This document only provides recommendations for\
    \ the mandatory-to-\n   implement algorithms and \"too weak\" algorithms that\
    \ are recommended\n   not to be implemented.  As a result, any algorithm listed\
    \ at the\n   IPsec IANA registry that is not mentioned in this document MAY be\n\
    \   implemented.  It is expected that this document will be updated over\n   time\
    \ and future versions will only mention algorithms that have\n   evolved in status.\
    \  For clarification, when an algorithm has been\n   mentioned in [RFC7321], this\
    \ document states explicitly the update of\n   the status.\n   Although this document\
    \ updates the algorithms to keep the AH/ESP\n   communication secure over time,\
    \ it also aims at providing\n   recommendations so that AH/ESP implementations\
    \ remain interoperable.\n   AH/ESP interoperability is addressed by an incremental\
    \ introduction\n   or deprecation of algorithms.  In addition, this document also\n\
    \   considers the new use cases for AH/ESP deployment, such as IoT.\n   It is\
    \ expected that deprecation of an algorithm be performed\n   gradually.  This\
    \ provides time for various implementations to update\n   their implemented algorithms\
    \ while remaining interoperable.  Unless\n   there are strong security reasons,\
    \ an algorithm is expected to be\n   downgraded from MUST to MUST- or SHOULD,\
    \ instead of MUST NOT (see\n   Section 2).  Similarly, an algorithm that has not\
    \ been mentioned as\n   mandatory-to-implement is expected to be introduced with\
    \ a SHOULD\n   instead of a MUST.\n   The current trend toward IoT and its adoption\
    \ of AH/ESP requires this\n   specific use case to be taken into account as well.\
    \  IoT devices are\n   resource-constrained devices, and their choice of algorithms\
    \ is\n   motivated by minimizing the footprint of the code, the computation\n\
    \   effort, and the size of the messages to send.  This document\n   indicates\
    \ \"(IoT)\" when a specified algorithm is specifically listed\n   for IoT devices.\
    \  Requirement levels that are marked as \"IoT\" apply\n   to IoT devices and\
    \ to server-side implementations that might\n   presumably need to interoperate\
    \ with them, including any general-\n   purpose VPN gateways.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Document Audience
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Document Audience\n   The recommendations of this document mostly target\
    \ AH/ESP\n   implementers as implementations need to meet both high security\n\
    \   expectations as well as high interoperability between various vendors\n  \
    \ and with different versions.  Interoperability requires a smooth move\n   to\
    \ more secure cipher suites.  This may differ from a user point of\n   view that\
    \ may deploy and configure AH/ESP with only the safest cipher\n   suite.\n   This\
    \ document does not give any recommendations for the use of\n   algorithms, it\
    \ only gives recommendations for implementations.  The\n   use of algorithms by\
    \ a specific user is dictated by their own\n   security policy requirements, which\
    \ are outside the scope of this\n   document.\n   The algorithms considered here\
    \ are listed by IANA as part of the\n   IKEv2 parameters.  IKEv1 is out of scope\
    \ of this document.  IKEv1 is\n   deprecated; the recommendations of this document\
    \ must not be\n   considered for IKEv1, nor may IKEv1 parameters be considered\
    \ by this\n   document.\n   The IANA registry for \"Internet Key Exchange Version\
    \ 2 (IKEv2)\n   Parameters\" contains some entries that are not for use with ESP\
    \ or\n   AH.  This document does not modify the status of those algorithms.\n"
- title: 2.  Requirements Language
  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear\
    \ in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n   We define some additional terms here:\n\
    \   SHOULD+   This term means the same as SHOULD.  However, it is likely\n   \
    \          that an algorithm marked as SHOULD+ will be promoted at\n         \
    \    some future time to be a MUST.\n   SHOULD-   This term means the same as\
    \ SHOULD.  However, an algorithm\n             marked as SHOULD- may be deprecated\

    \ that this algorithm will no longer be a MUST in\n             a future document.\
    \  Although its status will be determined\n             at a later time, it is\
    \ reasonable to expect that if a\n             future revision of a document alters\
    \ the status of a MUST-\n             algorithm, it will remain at least a SHOULD\
    \ or a SHOULD-\n             level.\n   IoT       The Internet of Things.\n"
- title: 3.  Manual Keying
  contents:
  - "3.  Manual Keying\n   Manual keying SHOULD NOT be used, as it is inherently dangerous.\n\
    \   Without any secure keying protocol, such as IKE, IPsec does not offer\n  \
    \ Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) protection; there is no entity to\n   ensure the\
    \ refreshing of session keys, the tracking of Security\n   Parameter Index (SPI)\
    \ uniqueness, and the single use of nonces,\n   Initialization Vectors (IVs),\
    \ and counters.  This document was\n   written for deploying ESP/AH using IKE\
    \ [RFC7296] and assumes that\n   keying happens using IKEv2 or higher.\n   If\
    \ manual keying is used regardless, Counter Mode algorithms such as\n   ENCR_AES_CTR,\
    \ ENCR_AES_CCM, ENCR_AES_GCM, and ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305\n   MUST NOT be used,\
    \ as it is incompatible with a secure and persistent\n   handling of the counter\
    \ (as explained in the Security Considerations\n   section of [RFC3686]).  This\
    \ particularly applies to IoT devices that\n   have no state across reboots. \
    \ At the time of writing, ENCR_AES_CBC\n   is the only mandatory-to-implement\
    \ encryption algorithm suitable for\n   manual keying.\n"
- title: 4.  Encryption Must Be Authenticated
  contents:
  - "4.  Encryption Must Be Authenticated\n   Encryption without authentication is\
    \ not effective and MUST NOT be\n   used.  IPsec offers three ways to provide\
    \ both encryption and\n   authentication:\n   o  ESP with an Authenticated Encryption\
    \ with Associated Data (AEAD)\n      cipher\n   o  ESP with a non-AEAD cipher\
    \ + authentication\n   o  ESP with a non-AEAD cipher + AH with authentication\n\
    \   The fastest and most modern method is to use ESP with a combined mode\n  \
    \ cipher, such as an AEAD cipher, that handles encryption/decryption\n   and authentication\
    \ in a single step.  In this case, the AEAD cipher\n   is set as the encryption\
    \ algorithm, and the authentication algorithm\n   is set to none.  Examples of\
    \ this are ENCR_AES_GCM_16 and\n   ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305.\n   A more traditional\
    \ approach is to use ESP with an encryption and an\n   authentication algorithm.\
    \  This approach is slower, as the data has\n   to be processed twice: once for\
    \ encryption/decryption and once for\n   authentication.  An example of this is\
    \ ENCR_AES_CBC combined with\n   AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_512_256.\n   The last method that\
    \ can be used is ESP+AH.  This method is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  It is the slowest\
    \ method and also takes up more octets\n   due to the double header of ESP+AH.\
    \  This results in a smaller\n   effective MTU for the encrypted data.  With this\
    \ method, ESP is only\n   used for confidentiality without an authentication algorithm,\
    \ and a\n   second IPsec protocol of type AH is used for authentication.  An\n\
    \   example of this is ESP with ENCR_AES_CBC with AH with\n   AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_512_256.\n"

    \ sense, the status for\n   256-bit keys has been raised from MAY in [RFC7321]\
    \ to MUST.\n   IANA has allocated codes for cryptographic algorithms that have\

    \  Usually, the use of these algorithms is limited to\n   specific cases, and\

    \ that are\n   not expected to be used to secure IPsec communications.  Such\n\
    \   algorithms are noted as non-IPsec.  As a result, these algorithms\n   MUST\

    \ is a more modern approach and\n   alternative for ENCR_3DES than ENCR_AES_CBC,\
    \ and so it is expected to\n   be favored to replace ENCR_3DES.\n   ENCR_BLOWFISH\
    \ has been downgraded to MUST NOT as it has been\n   deprecated for years by TWOFISH,\

    \ ENCR_NULL status was set to MUST in [RFC7321] and remains a MUST to\n   enable\

    \   ENCR_AES_CBC status remains at MUST.  ENCR_AES_CBC MUST be\n   implemented\
    \ in order to enable interoperability between\n   implementations that followed\
    \ [RFC7321].  However, there is a trend\n   for the industry to move to AEAD encryption,\
    \ and the overhead of\n   ENCR_AES_CBC remains quite large, so it is expected\
    \ to be replaced by\n   AEAD algorithms in the long term.\n   ENCR_AES_CCM_8 status\

    \ encryption) in conjunction with AH; some configurations\n   of this combination\
    \ of services have been shown to be insecure\n   [PD10].  In addition, AUTH_NONE\
    \ authentication cannot be combined\n   with ESP NULL encryption.\n   AUTH_HMAC_MD5_96\
    \ and AUTH_KPDK_MD5 were not mentioned in [RFC7321].\n   As MD5 is known to be\
    \ vulnerable to collisions, these algorithms MUST\n   NOT be used.\n   AUTH_HMAC_SHA1_96\
    \ has been downgraded from MUST in [RFC7321] to MUST-\n   as there is an industry-wide\
    \ trend to deprecate its usage.\n   AUTH_DES_MAC was not mentioned in [RFC7321].\
    \  As DES is known to be\n   vulnerable, it MUST NOT be used.\n   AUTH_AES_XCBC_96\
    \ is set as SHOULD only in the scope of IoT, as IoT\n   deployments tend to prefer\
    \ AES-based Hashed Message Authentication\n   Code (HMAC) functions in order to\
    \ avoid implementing SHA2.  For the\n   wide VPN deployment, as it has not been\
    \ widely adopted, it has been\n   downgraded from SHOULD to MAY.\n   AUTH_AES_128_GMAC\
    \ status has been downgraded from SHOULD+ to MAY.\n   Along with AUTH_AES_192_GMAC\
    \ and AUTH_AES_256_GMAC, these algorithms\n   should only be used for AH and not\
    \ for ESP.  If using ENCR_NULL,\n   AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_256_128 is recommended for\
    \ integrity.  If using AES-\n   GMAC in ESP without authentication, ENCR_NULL_AUTH_AES_GMAC\
    \ is\n   recommended.  Therefore, these algorithms are kept at MAY.\n   AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_256_128\
    \ was not mentioned in [RFC7321], as no\n   SHA2-based authentication was mentioned.\
    \  AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_256_128 MUST\n   be implemented in order to replace AUTH_HMAC_SHA1_96.\
    \  Note that due\n   to a long standing common implementation bug of this algorithm\
    \ that\n   truncates the hash at 96 bits instead of 128 bits, it is recommended\n\
    \   that implementations prefer AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_512_256 over\n   AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_256_128\
    \ if they implement AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_512_256.\n   AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_512_256 SHOULD\
    \ be implemented as a future replacement\n   of AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_256_128 or when\
    \ stronger security is required.\n   This value has been preferred to AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_384,\
    \ as the\n   additional overhead of AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_512 is negligible.\n"

  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   The security of a system that uses cryptography\
    \ depends on both the\n   strength of the cryptographic algorithms chosen and\
    \ the strength of\n   the keys used with those algorithms.  The security also\
    \ depends on\n   the engineering and administration of the protocol used by the\
    \ system\n   to ensure that there are no non-cryptographic ways to bypass the\n\
    \   security of the overall system.\n   This document concerns itself with the\
    \ selection of cryptographic\n   algorithms for the use of ESP and AH, specifically\
    \ with the selection\n   of mandatory-to-implement algorithms.  The algorithms\
    \ identified in\n   this document as \"MUST implement\" or \"SHOULD implement\"\
    \ are not known\n   to be broken at the current time, and cryptographic research\
    \ to date\n   leads us to believe that they will likely remain secure into the\n\
    \   foreseeable future.  However, this is not necessarily forever.\n   Therefore,\
    \ we expect that revisions of that document will be issued\n   from time to time\
