  - " Hereafter proposed protocols shall be submitted in the form of\non-line documents,\
    \ preferably as nls files at the Network\nInformation Center. This will greatly\
    \ facilitate the review\nprocess and enable editorial and substantive changes\
    \ to proceed\nquickly. This also will permit timely updating of protocol\ndocuments\
    \ as may be neccessitated by future decisions. On-line\ndocuments are also easily\
    \ distributed to the network community.\nIf you find great difficulty in complying\
    \ with this request\nplease contact me.                                      \
    \               \nIt should be noted by all Telnet protocol readers and especially\n\
    implementers that all the existing Telnet Options that involve\nsubnegotiation\
    \ are modified [see RFC 562] to terminate the\nsubnegotiation strings with IAC\
    \ SE. The value of SE is 240. Also\nnote that within subnegotiations the occurance\
    \ of a byte with the\nvalue 255 [IAC] requires doubling that byte on transmission.\
