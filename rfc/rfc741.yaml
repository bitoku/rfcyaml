    \     1.  INTRODUCTION\n   Currently,  computer  communication  networks  are\
    \ designed  for data\n   transfer.   Since there  is  a  growing  need  for  communication\
    \  of\n   real-time interactive voice over computer networks, new communication\n\
    \   discipline  must be developed.   The current HOST-to-HOST protocol of\n  \
    \ the ARPANET,  which was designed  (and optimized)  for data transfer,\n   was\
    \ found  unsuitable  for  real-time  network  voice  communication.\n   Therefore\
    \   this  Network  Voice  Protocol  (NVP)  was  designed  and\n   implemented.\n\
    \   Important design objectives of the NVP are:\n      - Recovery  of loss of\
    \ any message  without  catastrophic effects.\n        Therefore  all answers\
    \ have to be unambiguous, in the sense that\n        it must be clear to which\
    \ inquiry a reply refers.\n      - Design  such that no system  can tie up the\
    \ resources of another\n        system unnecessarily.\n      - Avoidance of end-to-end\
    \ retransmission.\n      - Separation of control signals from data traffic.\n\
    \      - Separation of vocoding-dependent parts from vocoding-independent\n  \
    \      parts.\n      - Adaptation to the dynamic network performance.\n      -\
    \ Optimal  performance,  i.e.  guaranteed  required bandwidth, and\n        minimized\
    \ maximum delay.\n      - Independence from lower level protocols.\n   The protocol\
    \ consists of two parts:\n      (1) The control protocol,\n      (2) The data\
    \ protocol.\n   Control messages are sent as controlled (TYPE 0/0) messages, and\
    \ data\n   messages  may be sent as either controlled (TYPE 0/0) or uncontrolled\n\
    \   (TYPE  0/3)   messages   (see  BBN  Report  1822  for  definition  of\n  \
    \ MESSAGE-TYPE).\n   Throughout this document a \"word\" means a \"16-bit quantity\"\
    .\n"

    \ 2.  THE CONTROL PROTOCOL\n   Throughout  this document the 12-bit MESSAGE-ID\
    \ (see BBN Report 1822)\n   is referred to as LINK (its 8 MSBs) and SUB-LINK (its\
    \ 4 LSBs).\n   The control  protocol starts with an initial connection phase on\
    \ link\n   377 and continues on other links assigned at run time.\n   Four links\
    \ are used for each voice communication:\n      Link L    will be used for control,\
    \ from CALLER to ANSWERER.\n      Link K    will be used for control, from ANSWERER\
    \ to CALLER.\n      Link L+1  will be used for data,    from CALLER to ANSWERER.\n\
    \      Link K+1  will be used for data,    from ANSWERER to CALLER.\n   Both \
    \ L and K should be between 340 and 375 (octal). L and K need not\n   differ.\n\
    \   The first message  (CALLER  to ANSWERER)  on link 377 indicates which\n  \
    \ user wants to talk to whom and specifies K. As a response (on K), the\n   ANSWERER\
    \ either refuses the call or accepts it and assigns L.\n   The CALLER  then calls\
    \  again  (this  time on link L).  The  ANSWERER\n   initiates  a negotiation\
    \  session  to verify the compatibility of the\n   two parties.\n   The negotiation\
    \  consists  of suggestions  put forth by  one  of  the\n   parties,  which are\
    \ either  accepted  or rejected by the other party.\n   The suggesting  party\
    \ in the negotiation  is called  the  NEGOTIATION\n   MASTER.  The other party\
    \ is called the NEGOTIATION SLAVE. Usually the\n   ANSWERER  is the negotiation\
    \  master,  unless agreed otherwise by the\n   method described later.\n   If\
    \ the negotiation  fails,  either  party may terminate  the call  by\n   sending\
    \  a \"GOODBYE\".  If the negotiation  is successfully ended, the\n   ANSWERER\
    \  rings bells to draw human attention  and sends \"RINGING\" to\n   the CALLER.\
    \ When the call is answered (by a human), a \"READY\" is sent\n   to the CALLER\
    \  and the data starts flowing (on L+1 and K+1). However,\n   a \"READY\" can\
    \ be sent without a preceeding \"RINGING\".\n   This bell ringing  occurs  only\
    \ after the  initial  call  (not  after\n   renegotiation).\n   The assignment\
    \  of L and  K  cannot  be  changed  after  the  initial\n   connection phase.\n\
    \   Only one control message can be sent in a network-message. Extra bits\n  \
    \ needed to fill the network-message are ignored.\n"

    \ (incompatibility) is discovered: either to try\n         alternative options\
    \ or to abort the connection. Upon completion\n         of successful  negotiation,\
    \ the NEGOTIATION MASTER sends either\n         #9 (RINGING)  only  if it is the\
    \ ANSWERER  and if  this  is  an\n         initial  connection,  else it sends\

    \ readiness  of  the  other\n         party.  The inquiries  (#8) before the successful\
    \ completion of\n         the negotiation are ignored. However, these inquiries\
    \ after the\n         first RINGING  (#9)  and before the first READY (#6) are\
    \ needed\n         to keep the ANSWERER ringing.\n         Note that the negotiation\
    \ process can be shortened by using the\n         VERSION option, as shown in\
    \ the examples that follow.\n   ON RENEGOTIATION\n      At any stage after links\
    \  are  agreed  upon,  either  party  might\n      request  a RENEGOTIATION. \
    \ If the request is approved by the other\n      party, either party might become\
    \ the NEGOTIATION MASTER, depending\n      on the type of renegotiation  request.\
    \  When renegotiation starts,\n      no previously  negotiated  agreements  (except\
    \ LINK numbers) hold,\n      and all items have to be  renegotiated  from  scratch.\
    \  Note  that\n      renegotiation  may entirely  replace  the  negotiation  phase\
    \  and\n      allows the CALLER to be the NEGOTIATION MASTER.\n      Upon issuance\
    \  (or reception)  of RENEGOTIATION  REQUEST, all data\n      messages   are \
    \ ignored  until  the  positive  indication  of  the\n      successful completion\
    \ of the renegotiation (#6).\n      After the completion  of renegotiation,  the\
    \ frame-count  (see the\n      section on MESSAGE-HEADER) may be reset to zero.\n\
    \   THE HEADER OF DATA MESSAGES\n      Data messages  are the messages  which\
    \ contain vocoded speech. The\n      first 32 bits of each data message  is the\
    \  MESSAGE-HEADER,  which\n      carries sequence and timing information as described\
    \ below.\n      For each vocoding  scheme a \"FRAME\" is defined as the transmission\n\
    \      interval  (as agreed  upon at the negotiation  stage in <WHAT#6>).\n  \
    \    Since this interval  is defined  by the  number  of  samples,  its\n    \
    \  duration  can be found by multiplying the sampling period <WHAT#2>\n      by\
    \ the interval  length  (in samples) <WHAT#6>. For example, in V1\n      the sampling\
    \  period  is 150  microseconds  and  the  transmission\n      interval is 128\
    \ samples, which yields:\n         128*150 microseconds = 19.2 milliseconds.\n\

    \  THE LPC DATA PROTOCOL\n   The DATA sent at each transmission interval is called\
    \ a PARCEL.\n   Network messages always contain an integral number of PARCELs.\n\
    \   There are two independent  issues  in the coding.  One is, obviously,\n  \
    \ the acoustic  coding,  i.e., which parameters have to be transmitted.\n   SIMPLE\
    \  acoustic  coding  is sending  all  the  parameters  at  every\n   transmission\
    \ interval. OPTIMIZED acoustic coding sends only as little\n   as acoustically\
    \  needed.  DELCO is an example  of OPTIMIZED  acoustic\n   coding.\n   In this\
    \ document  only the format  of the SIMPLE  acoustic  coding is\n   defined.\n\
    \   All the transmitted  parameters are sent as pointers into agreed-upon\n  \
    \ tables.  These tables  are  defined  as  two  lists  of  values.  The\n   transmitter\
    \ table {X(J)} is used in the following way: The value V is\n   coded  as the\
    \ code  J if X(J-1) < V =< X(J). The receiver table {R(J)\n   is used to retrieve\
    \  the value R(J) if the code J was received. X(-1)\n   is implicitly  defined\
    \  as minus-infinity,  and X(Jmax) is explicitly\n   defined as plus-infinity.\n\
    \   For each parameter, {X(J)} and {R(J)} may be defined independently.\n   The\
    \ second  coding  issue is the information  coding  technique.  The\n   SIMPLE\
    \  (information-wise)  way of sending  the information is to use\n   binary  \
    \ coding  for  the  codes  representing  the  parameters.  The\n   OPTIMIZED \
    \ way is to compute  distributions for each parameter and to\n   define the appropriate\
    \ coding. It is very probable that the PITCH and\n   GAIN will be decoded  absolutely\
    \ in the first PARCEL of each message,\n   and incrementally thereafter.\n   At\
    \ present, only the SIMPLE (information-wise) coding is used.\n   The details\
    \  of the LPC data protocol  and its Tables-Set-#1  can  be\n   found in Appendix\
    \ 1.\n"

    \   Hence  at  each  transmission   interval   (128  samples   times  150\n  \
    \ microseconds)  67 bits are sent, which results in a data rate of 3490\n   bps.\

    \  SIMPLE-SIMPLE  coding  is used,  which requires  the  least\n   computation\

    \    The following  tables  are arranged in three columns, {X(j)}, {j},\n    \
    \  and {R(j)}.  Note that the entries in the {X(j)} column are half a\n      step\
    \ off the other columns.  This is to  indicate  that  INTERVALS\n      from X-domain\
    \ (pitch, gain, and the Ks) are mapped into CODES {j},\n      which are transmitted\
    \  over the network,  to be translated  by the\n      receiver   into  the  {R(j)}.\
    \   These  intervals  are  defined  as\n      OPEN-CLOSE  intervals.  For  example,\
    \  the  PITCH  value  (at  the\n      transmitter)  of 4131 belongs to the interval\
    \ \"(4024,4131]\", hence\n      it is coded  as j=6 which  is mapped  by the receiver\
    \ to the value\n      21.  Similarly, the value of 2400 for INDEX7 is found to\
    \ belong to\n      the interval  \"(2009,2811]\", coded into the CODE 3 and mapped\
    \ back\n      into 2411.\n      Note  that  if N bits  are used  by a certain\
    \ CODE, then there are\n      2**N+1  entries  in the X-table,  but only  2**N\
    \  entries  in  the\n      R-table.\n      The  transformation   values   used\
    \  for  PITCH,   GAIN,  and  the\n      K-parameters  (in the X- and R-tables)\
    \  are as defined in NSC Note\n      42.\n      Values  above  and below  the\
    \ range of the X-table are mapped into\n      the maximum and minimum table indices,\
    \ respectively.\n      Note that R(J) of INDEX5 is identical to R(2J) of INDEX6,\
    \ and that\n      R(J)  of INDEX6  is identical to R(2J) of INDEX7. Therefore,\
    \ it is\n      possible to store only the R-table of INDEX7, without the R-tables\n\
    \      of INDEX5 and INDEX6.\n      In the SPS-41 implementation there is no need\
    \ to store any R-table\n      for the K-parameters.  The transmitted  index can\
    \ be used directly\n      (with the appropriate  scaling)  as an index into the\
    \ SPS built-in\n      TRIG tables.\n   COMMENTS ON THE PITCH TABLE\n      The\
    \ level J=0 defines the UNVOICED condition. The receiver maps it\n      into the\
    \ number of samples per frame (here 128).\n      This PITCH table differs  significantly\
    \  from previous  tables and\n      supersedes  the table published  in NSC Note\
    \ 36.  Details  of  the\n      calculation  of the table  can be found  in NSC\
    \ Note 42. Immediate\n      questions should be referred to John Markel.\n"

    \ TABLE\n      The level J=0 defines absolute silence.\n      This table  is designed\

    \ of 43.5 dB.\n      NSC Notes  36, 45, 56 and 58 supply background for the GAIN\
    \ table.\n      Gain is the energy of the pre-emphasized, windowed signal.\n \
    \     This table  is the NEW GAIN table. NSC Notes 56 and 58 explain the\n   \
    \   reasoning behind the NEW GAIN.\n   COMMENTS ON THE INDEX7 TABLE\n      Positive\
    \ values are coded into the range [0-63, decimal]. Negative\n      values  are\
    \ coded into the 7-bits two's complement of the codes of\n      their absolute\
    \ value [65-127, decimal].\n      Note that all values -403 < V < 403 are coded\

    \  TIME-END-SILENCE.\n         The amount  of time  the transmitter  backs  up\
    \ at the end of a\n         LONG-SILENCE  in order to ensure  a smooth  transition\
    \  back to\n         speech.\n      TRI      2.000 sec  TIME-RESPONSE-INITIAL.\n\
    \         Time for waiting  for response for an initial call (#1 and #3).\n  \
    \       The initial call is repeated every TRI until an answer arrives,\n    \
    \     or until TRIGU expires.\n      TRIGU   20.000 sec  TIME-RESPONSE-INITIAL-GIVEUP.\n\
    \         If no response  to an initial  call is  received  within  TRIGU\n  \
    \       after the FIRST initial call, the system gives up, assuming the\n    \
    \     other system is down.\n      TRQ      1.000 sec  TIME-RESPONSE-INQUIRY.\n\
