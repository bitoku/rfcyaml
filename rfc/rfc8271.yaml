  - "1.  Introduction\n   Packet Switch Capable (PSC) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label
    Switched\n   Paths (LSPs) can be set up using Generalized Multiprotocol Label\n
    \  Switching (GMPLS) signaling procedures specified in [RFC3473] for\n   both
    unidirectional and bidirectional tunnels.  The GMPLS signaling\n   allows sending
    and receiving the RSVP messages in-band with the data\n   traffic or out-of-band
    over a separate control channel.  Fast Reroute\n   (FRR) [RFC4090] has been widely
    deployed in the packet TE networks\n   today and is desirable for TE GMPLS LSPs.
    \ Using FRR methods also\n   allows the leveraging of existing mechanisms for
    failure detection\n   and restoration in deployed networks.\n   The FRR procedures
    defined in [RFC4090] describe the behavior of the\n   Point of Local Repair (PLR)
    to reroute traffic and signaling onto the\n   bypass tunnel in the event of a
    failure for protected LSPs.  Those\n   procedures are applicable to the unidirectional
    protected LSPs\n   signaled using either RSVP-TE [RFC3209] or GMPLS procedures\n
    \  [RFC3473].  When using the FRR procedures defined in [RFC4090] with\n   co-routed
    bidirectional GMPLS LSPs, it is desired that same PLR and\n   Merge Point (MP)
    pairs are selected in each direction and that both\n   PLR and MP assign the same
    bidirectional bypass tunnel.  This\n   document updates the FRR procedures defined
    in [RFC4090] to\n   coordinate the bidirectional bypass tunnel assignment and
    to exchange\n   MP labels between upstream and downstream PLRs of the protected\n
    \  co-routed bidirectional LSP.\n   When using FRR procedures with co-routed bidirectional
    GMPLS LSPs, it\n   is possible in some cases for the RSVP signaling refreshes
    to stop\n   reaching certain nodes along the protected LSP path after the PLRs\n
    \  finish rerouting of the signaling messages.  This can occur after a\n   failure
    event when using node protection bypass tunnels.  As shown in\n   Figure 2, this
    is possible even with selecting the same bidirectional\n   bypass tunnels in both
    directions and the same PLR and MP pairs.\n   This is caused by the asymmetry
    of paths that may be taken by the\n   bidirectional LSP's signaling in the forward
    and reverse directions\n   due to upstream and downstream PLRs independently triggering
    FRR.  In\n   such cases, after FRR, the RSVP soft-state timeout causes the\n   protected
    bidirectional LSP to be torn down, with subsequent traffic\n   loss.\n   Protection
    State Coordination Protocol [RFC6378] is applicable to FRR\n   [RFC4090] for local
    protection of co-routed bidirectional LSPs in\n   order to minimize traffic disruptions
    in both directions.  However,\n   this does not address the above-mentioned problem
    of RSVP soft-state\n   timeout that can occur in the control plane.\n   This document
    defines a solution to the RSVP soft-state timeout issue\n   by providing mechanisms
    in the control plane to complement the FRR\n   procedures of [RFC4090].  This
    solution allows the RSVP soft state\n   for co-routed, protected bidirectional
    GMPLS LSPs to be maintained in\n   the control plane and enables co-routing of
    the traffic paths in the\n   forward and reverse directions after FRR.\n   The
    procedures defined in this document apply to PSC TE co-routed,\n   protected bidirectional
    LSPs and co-routed bidirectional FRR bypass\n   tunnels both signaled by GMPLS.
    \ Unless otherwise specified in this\n   document, the FRR procedures defined
    in [RFC4090] are not modified by\n   this document.  The FRR mechanism for associated
    bidirectional GMPLS\n   LSPs where two unidirectional GMPLS LSPs are bound together
    by using\n   association signaling [RFC7551] is outside the scope of this\n   document.\n"

      - "4.5.1.  Bidirectional Bypass Tunnel Assignment Signaling Procedure\n   It
        is desirable to coordinate the bidirectional bypass tunnel\n   selected at
        the downstream and upstream PLRs so that the rerouted\n   traffic flows on
        co-routed paths after FRR.  To achieve this, a new\n   RSVP subobject is defined
        for RRO that identifies a bidirectional\n   bypass tunnel that is assigned
        at a downstream PLR to protect a\n   bidirectional LSP.\n   When the procedures
        defined in this document are in use, the\n   BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject MUST
        be added by each downstream PLR in\n   the RSVP Path RRO message of the GMPLS
        signaled bidirectional\n   protected LSP to record the downstream bidirectional
        bypass tunnel\n   assignment.  This subobject is sent in the RSVP Path RRO
        message\n   every time the downstream PLR assigns or updates the bypass tunnel\n
        \  assignment.  The downstream PLR can assign a bypass tunnel when\n   processing
        the first Path message of the protected LSP as long as it\n   has a topological
        view of the downstream MP and the traversed path\n   information in the Explicit
        Route Object (ERO).  For the protected\n   LSP where the downstream MP cannot
        be determined from the first Path\n   message (e.g., when using loose hops
        in the ERO), the downstream PLR\n   needs to wait for the Resv message with
        RRO in order to assign a\n   bypass tunnel.  However, in both cases, the downstream
        PLR cannot\n   update the data plane until it receives Resv messages containing
        the\n   MP labels.\n   The upstream PLR (downstream MP) simply reflects the
        bypass tunnel\n   assignment in the reverse direction.  The absence of the\n
        \  BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject in Path RRO means that the relevant node\n
        \  or interface is not protected by a bidirectional bypass tunnel.\n   Hence,
        the upstream PLR need not assign a bypass tunnel in the\n   reverse direction.\n
        \  When the BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject is added in the Path RRO:\n   o  The
        IPv4 or IPv6 subobject containing the Node-ID address MUST\n      also be
        added [RFC4561].  The Node-ID address MUST match the\n      source address
        of the bypass tunnel selected for this protected\n      LSP.\n   o  The BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT
        subobject MUST be added immediately after\n      the Node-ID address.\n   o
        \ The Label subobject MUST also be added [RFC3209].\n   The rules for adding
        an IPv4 or IPv6 Interface address subobject and\n   Unnumbered Interface ID
        subobject as specified in [RFC3209] and\n   [RFC4090] are not modified by
        the above procedure.  The options\n   specified in Section 6.1.3 in [RFC4990]
        are also applicable as long\n   as the above-mentioned rules are followed
        when using the FRR\n   procedures defined in this document.\n   An upstream
        PLR (downstream MP) SHOULD check all BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT\n   subobjects in the
        Path RRO to see if the destination address in the\n   BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT matches
        the address of the upstream PLR.  For each\n   BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject
        that matches, the upstream PLR looks for\n   a tunnel that has a source address
        matching the downstream PLR that\n   inserted the BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT, as indicated
        by the Node-ID address\n   and the same Tunnel ID as indicated in the BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT.
        \ The\n   RRO can contain multiple addresses to identify a node.  However,
        the\n   upstream PLR relies on the Node-ID address preceding the\n   BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT
        subobject for identifying the bypass tunnel.  If\n   the bypass tunnel is
        not found, the upstream PLR SHOULD send a Notify\n   message [RFC3473] with
        Error Code \"FRR Bypass Assignment Error\"\n   (value 44) and Sub-code \"Bypass
        Tunnel Not Found\" (value 1) to the\n   downstream PLR.  Upon receiving this
        error, the downstream PLR SHOULD\n   remove the bypass tunnel assignment and
        select an alternate bypass\n   tunnel if one available.  The RRO containing
        BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT\n   subobject(s) is then simply forwarded downstream in
        the RSVP Path\n   message.\n   A downstream PLR may add, remove, or change
        the bypass tunnel\n   assignment for a protected LSP resulting in the addition,
        removal, or\n   modification of the BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject in the Path
        RRO,\n   respectively.  In this case, the downstream PLR SHOULD generate a\n
        \  modified Path message and forward it downstream.  The downstream MP\n   SHOULD
        check the RRO in the received Path message and update the\n   bypass tunnel
        assignment in the reverse direction accordingly.\n"

    PLRs finish\n   rerouting of the signaling messages.  However, unlike with the\n
    \  in-band signaling, unidirectional link failures as described in\n   Section
    5.3 do not result in soft-state timeout with GMPLS out-of-\n   band signaling.
    \ Apart from this, the FRR procedure described in\n   Section 5 is equally applicable
    to the GMPLS out-of-band signaling.\n"

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   This document introduces a new BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT
    subobject for the\n   RECORD_ROUTE Object that is carried in an RSVP signaling
    message.\n   Thus, in the event of the interception of a signaling message, more\n
    \  information about the LSP's fast reroute protection can be deduced\n   than
    was previously the case.  This is judged to be a very minor\n   security risk
    as this information is already available by other\n   means.  If an MP does not
    find a matching bypass tunnel with given\n   source and destination addresses
    locally, it ignores the\n   BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject.  Due to this, security
    risks introduced\n   by inserting a random address in this subobject is minimal.
    \ The\n   Notify message for the \"FRR Bypass Assignment Error\" defined in this\n
    \  document does not result in tear-down of the protected LSP and does\n   not
    affect service.\n   Security considerations for RSVP-TE and GMPLS signaling extensions\n
    \  are covered in [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].  Further, general\n   considerations
    for securing RSVP-TE in MPLS-TE and GMPLS networks can\n   be found in [RFC5920].
    \ This document updates the mechanisms defined\n   in [RFC4090], which also discusses
    related security measures that are\n   also applicable to this document.  As specified
    in [RFC4090], a PLR\n   and its selected merge point trust RSVP messages received
    from each\n   other.  The security considerations pertaining to the original RSVP\n
    \  protocol [RFC2205] also remain relevant to the updates in this\n   document.\n"
