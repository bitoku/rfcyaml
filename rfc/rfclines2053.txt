The AM Domain The AM Domain is an official Internet top level domain of Armenia.
AM is the ISO 3166 2 letter country code for the Republic of Armenia and thus the AM Domain is established as a top level domain and registered with the InterNIC the same way other country domains are.
The AM Domain hierarchy is flat.
This means that any organization may be registered directly under the AM TLD.
However, subdomains are allowed, such as ORG and MIL, as well as CO and AC.
Please note that MIL.AM and GOV.AM domains are reserved by the Ministry of Defense and The Government of Armenia, respectively.
Other domains may be reserved for appropriate organizations by contacting AM Network Information Center at HOSTMASTER@AMNIC.NET. Registration
There are two types of registrations (1) Delegation, where a branch of the AM Domain is delegated to an organization running name servers to support that branch; or (2)
Direct Registration, in which the information is put directly into the main database.
In Direct Registration there are two cases: (a)
an IP host (with an IP address), and
(b) non IP host (for example, a UUCP host).
Any particular registration will involve any one of these three situations.
The registration is performed by the AM Network Information Center, national Internet registry of Armenia.
