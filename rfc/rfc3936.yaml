- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo specifies procedures for modifying the Resource\
    \ reSerVation\n   Protocol (RSVP) [RSVP], including (but not limited to) adding,\n\
    \   updating, extending or obsoleting: messages, message formats and\n   procedures,\
    \ object classes and class types, object formats and\n   procedures; header formats,\
    \ error codes and subcodes and semantics,\n   and procedures for sending, receiving,\
    \ and addressing RSVP messages.\n   IANA recognizes the following RSVP name spaces:\
    \ Message Types, Class\n   Names, Class Numbers, Class Types and Sub-objects,\
    \ Virtual\n   Destination Ports, and Error Codes and (Subcode) Values (all of\
    \ these\n   will collectively be referred to as RSVP entities in this document).\n\
    \   This memo specifies ranges for each name space and assignment\n   policies\
    \ for each range.  New RSVP name spaces must be defined in a\n   Standards Track\
    \ RFC which include guidelines for IANA assignments\n   within the new name spaces.\n\
    \   The assignment policies used in this document are: Standards Action\n   (as\
    \ defined in [IANA]), Expert Review, and Organization/Vendor\n   Private (more\
    \ simply, \"Vendor Private\"); the last two are defined in\n   this document.\
    \  The intent of these assignment policies is to ensure\n   that extensions to\
    \ RSVP receive adequate review before code-points\n   are assigned, without being\
    \ overly rigid.  Thus, if an extension is\n   widely accepted and its ramifications\
    \ are well understood, it may\n   receive an assignment from the Standards Action\
    \ space; however, if an\n   extension is experimental in nature, it receives an\
    \ assignment from\n   the Expert Review space, and may, with maturity, move to\
    \ Standards\n   Track.  Assignments from the Vendor Private space are not reviewed,\n\
    \   but there are mechanisms in place to ensure that these codepoints can\n  \
    \ co-exist in a network without harm.\n   A standards body other than the IETF\
    \ that wishes to obtain an\n   assignment for an RSVP entity must decide from\
    \ which type of\n   name/number space they desire their assignment be made from,\
    \ and then\n   submit the appropriate documentation.  For example, if the assignment\n\
    \   is to be made from a number space designated as Standards Action, a\n   Standards\
    \ Track RFC MUST be submitted in support of the request for\n   assignment.\n\
    \   This memo updates the IANA Considerations section (section 7) of\n   [RSVP-TE],\
    \ replacing the assignment policies stated there.\n   Conventions used in this\
    \ document\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",\
    \ \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP\
    \ 14, RFC 2119\n   [KEYWORDS].\n"
- title: 2.  Assignment Policies for RSVP Entities
  contents:
  - "2.  Assignment Policies for RSVP Entities\n   For each of the RSVP name spaces\
    \ identified by IANA, the space is\n   divided into assignment ranges; the following\
    \ terms are used in\n   describing the procedures by which IANA assigns values:\
    \ \"Standards\n   Action\" (as defined in [IANA]), \"Expert Review\", and\n  \
    \ \"Organization/Vendor Private\", defined below.\n   \"Expert Review\" ranges\
    \ refer to values that are to be reviewed by an\n   Expert designated by the IESG.\
    \  The code points from these ranges are\n   typically used for experimental extensions;\
    \ such assignments MUST be\n   requested by Experimental RFCs that document their\
    \ use and\n   processing, and the actual assignments made during the IANA actions\n\
    \   for the document.  Values from \"Expert Review\" ranges MUST be\n   registered\
    \ with IANA.\n   \"Organization/Vendor Private\" ranges refer to values that are\n\
    \   enterprise-specific; these MUST NOT be registered with IANA.  For\n   Vendor\
    \ Private values, the first 4-octet word of the data field MUST\n   be an enterprise\
    \ code [ENT] as registered with the IANA SMI Network\n   Management Private Enterprise\
    \ Codes, and the rest of the data\n   thereafter is for the private use of the\
    \ registered enterprise.  (For\n   each RSVP entity that has a Vendor Private\
    \ range, it must be\n   specified where exactly the data field starts; see below\
    \ for\n   examples.)  In this way, different enterprises, vendors, or Standards\n\
    \   Development Organizations (SDOs) can use the same code point without\n   fear\
    \ of collision.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Message Types
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Message Types\n   A Message Type is an 8-bit number that identifies the\
    \ function of the\n   RSVP message.  Values from 0 through 239 are to be assigned\
    \ by\n   Standards Action.  Values from 240 through 255 are to be assigned by\n\
    \   Expert Review.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Class Names and Numbers
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Class Names and Numbers\n   Each class of data objects in an RSVP message\
    \ is identified by an all\n   upper-case Class Name and an 8-bit Class Number\
    \ (also known as\n   Class-Num or C-Num).  Class Numbers are divided broadly into\
    \ three\n   ranges (0-127, 128-191, and 192-255) determined by the two high-order\n\
    \   bits of the Class-Num object (the 'b' below represents a bit).\n   Note: the\
    \ first 32-bit word of an Object whose Class-Num or Class-\n   Type is from the\
    \ Vendor Private range MUST be that vendor's SMI\n   enterprise code in network\
    \ octet order (these enterprise codes can be\n   obtained from, and registered\
    \ with, IANA).  An implementation\n   encountering a Vendor Private object with\
    \ an SMI enterprise code that\n   it does not recognize MUST treat that object\
    \ (and enclosing message)\n   based on the Class-Num, as specified in [RSVP],\
    \ section 3.10.\n      o  Class-Num = 0bbbbbbb\n         Class Numbers from 0\
    \ through 119 are to be assigned by\n         Standards Action.  Class Numbers\
    \ from 120 through 123 are to be\n         assigned by Expert Review.  Class Numbers\
    \ from 124 through 127\n         are reserved for Vendor Private Use.\n      o\
    \  Class-Num = 10bbbbbb\n         Class Numbers from 128 through 183 are to be\
    \ assigned by\n         Standards Action.  Class Numbers from 184 through 187\
    \ are to be\n         assigned by Expert Review.  Class Numbers from 188 through\
    \ 191\n         are reserved for Vendor Private Use.\n      o  Class-Num = 11bbbbbb\n\
    \         Class Numbers from 192 through 247 are to be assigned by\n         Standards\
    \ Action.  Class Numbers from 248 through 251 are to be\n         assigned by\
    \ Expert Review.  Class Numbers from 252 through 255\n         are reserved for\
    \ Vendor Private Use.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Class Types
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Class Types\n   Within each object class there is an 8-bit Class Type (also\
    \ known as\n   a C-Type).  Class Types are scoped to a Class Number.  In general,\n\
    \   the appropriateness of allowing assignments of Class Types through\n   Expert\
    \ Review or Vendor Private depends on the semantics of the Class\n   Number itself.\
    \  Thus, any new Class Number definition must specify an\n   appropriate IANA\
    \ Considerations policy for assigning additional Class\n   Type values.\n   For\
    \ Class Numbers that pre-date this document (specifically, 0, 1,\n   3-25, 30-37,\
    \ 42-45, 64, 65, 128-131, 161-165, 192-196, and 207), the\n   default assignment\
    \ policy for new Class Types is Standards Action,\n   unless a Standards Track\
    \ or Best Current Practice RFC supercedes\n   this.\n"
- title: 2.3.1.  Sub-objects
  contents:
  - "2.3.1.  Sub-objects\n   Within an object, sub-objects may be defined, generally\
    \ as a Type-\n   Length-Value triple.  This memo defines the assignment policies\
    \ for\n   sub-objects of EXPLICIT_ROUTE and RECORD_ROUTE.  An RFC defining new\n\
    \   sub-objects MUST state how IANA is to assign the sub-object Types.\n   The\
    \ EXPLICIT_ROUTE object [RSVP-TE] carries a variable length sub-\n   object that\
    \ is identified by a 7-bit Type field.  Types 0 through 119\n   are to be assigned\
    \ by Standards Action.  Types 120 through 123 are to\n   be assigned by Expert\
    \ Review.  Types 124 through 127 are to be\n   reserved for Vendor Private Use.\n\
    \   The RECORD_ROUTE object [RSVP-TE] carries a variable length sub-\n   object\
    \ that is identified by an 8-bit Type field.  Types 0 through\n   191 are to be\
    \ assigned by Standards Action.  Types 192 through 251\n   are to be assigned\
    \ by Expert Review.  Types 252 through 255 are to be\n   reserved for Vendor Private\
    \ Use.\n   The first four octets of the sub-object contents of a Vendor Private\n\
    \   sub-object of an EXPLICIT_ROUTE or RECORD_ROUTE object MUST be that\n   vendor's\
    \ SMI enterprise code in network octet order.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Virtual Destination Ports
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Virtual Destination Ports\n   Virtual destination ports are described in\
    \ [RSVP-IPSEC], which also\n   specifies how IANA assignments are to be made.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Error Codes and Values
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Error Codes and Values\n   An Error Code is an 8-bit quantity that appears\
    \ in an ERROR_SPEC\n   object to broadly define an error condition.  With each\
    \ Error Code\n   there may be a 16-bit Error Value that further specifies the\
    \ cause of\n   the error.  Error Value may be globally defined, in which case\
    \ the\n   sub-code component is assigned by IANA.\n   Error Code values from 0\
    \ through 239 are to be assigned by Standards\n   Action.  Values from 240 through\
    \ 251 are to be assigned by Expert\n   Review.  Values from 252 through 255 are\
    \ reserved for Vendor Private\n   Use.  If the Error Code is for Vendor Private\
    \ Use, the first four\n   octets following the Error Value MUST be the vendor's\
    \ SMI enterprise\n   code in network octet order.\n   Globally defined Error Values\
    \ are assigned by Standards Action.\n"
- title: 3.  Modifying RSVP Procedures
  contents:
  - "3.  Modifying RSVP Procedures\n   RSVP entities have associated procedures describing\
    \ when and how they\n   are to be sent, received, processed, and responded to.\
    \  A change to a\n   procedure that affects the processing of an RSVP entity that\
    \ belongs\n   to a range designated \"Standards Action\" MUST be documented in\
    \ a\n   Standards Track RFC.  A change to a procedure that affects the\n   processing\
    \ of an RSVP entity that belongs to a range designated\n   \"Expert Review\" MUST\
    \ be documented in an Experimental RFC.\n"

- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   It is hoped that the procedures outlined in this\
    \ memo will ensure\n   that changes made to RSVP will be better reviewed and thus\
    \ more\n   architecturally sound, thereby enhancing the security both of the\n\
    \   protocol and of networks deploying it.\n"
