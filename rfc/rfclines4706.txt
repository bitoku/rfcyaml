Abstract This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes objects used for managing parameters of the "Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line" family of interface types: ADSL, ADSL2, ADSL2 , and their variants.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in the Internet community for the purpose of managing ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2  lines.
The MIB module described in RFC 2662
[RFC2662] describes objects used for managing Asymmetric Bit Rate DSL (ADSL) interfaces per [T1E1.413], [G.992.1], and [G.992.2].
These object descriptions are based upon the specifications for the ADSL Embedded Operations Channel (EOC) as defined in American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
T1E1.413/1995 [T1E1.413] and International Telecommunication Union (ITU T)
G.992.1 [G.992.1] and G.992.2 [G.992.2].
This document does not obsolete RFC 2662
[RFC2662], but rather provides a more comprehensive management model that includes the ADSL2 and ADSL2  technologies per G.992.3, G.992.4, and G.992.5 ([G.992.3], [G.992.4], and [G.992.5] respectively).
In addition, objects have been added to improve the management of ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2  lines.
Additionally, the management framework for New Generation ADSL lines specified [TR 90] by the Digital Subscriber Line Forum (DSLF) has been taken into consideration.
That framework is based on ITU T G.997.1 standard [G.997.1] as well as on two amendments: ([G.997.1am1] and [G.997.1am2]).
This document refers to all three documents as G.997.1.
That is, a MIB attribute whose REFERENCE section provides a paragraph number in ITU T G.997.1 is actually originated from either G.997.1 [G.997.1] or one of its amendment documents.
Note that the revised ITU T G.997.1 standard also refers to the next generation of VDSL technology, known as VDSL2, as per ITU T G.993.2 [G.993.2].
However, managing VDSL2 lines is currently beyond the scope of this document.
The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2 transmission, as discussed in the IANA Considerations section of this document.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
This section outlines the relationship of this MIB module with other MIB modules described in RFCs.
Specifically, IF MIB as presented in RFC 2863
General IF MIB Integration (RFC 2863)
The ADSL2 Line MIB specifies the detailed attributes of a data interface.
As such, it needs to integrate with RFC 2863 [RFC2863].
ADSL lines that are identified with ifType adsl(94) MUST be managed with the MIB specified by RFC 2662.
lines identified with ifType adsl2plus(238) MUST be managed with the MIB specified by this document.
In any case, the SNMP agent may use either ifType interleave(124) or fast(125) for each channel, e.g., depending on whether or not it is capable of using an interleaver on that channel.
It may use the ifType channel(70) when all channels are capable of using an interleaver (e.g., for ADSL2 XTUs).
Note that the ifFixedLengthGroup from RFC 2863
[RFC2863] MUST be supported and that the ifRcvAddressGroup does not apply to this MIB module.
The MIB branch identified by ifType contains tables appropriate for the interface types described above.
Most such tables extend the ifEntry table and are indexed by ifIndex.
For interfaces in systems implementing this MIB module, those table entries indexed by ifIndex MUST be persistent.
The following attributes are part of the mandatory ifGeneralInformationGroup in the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863] and are not duplicated in the ADSL2 Line MIB.
This object MUST have an octet string with zero length.
Use of ifTable Objects 2.2.
The IANA has allocated ifType adsl2plus(238) for Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop Version 2.
A separate ifType number was necessary to distinguish between ADSL lines that are managed with the RFC 2662 management model and ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2  lines managed with the model defined in this document.
Also, the IANA has assigned transmission number 238 to the ADSL2 LINE MIB module.
An assignment was in fact done when RFC 2662 was published, but as this MIB does not obsolete RFC 2662, it required a new assignment from IANA.

Line consists of two units:
ATU C (the central office termination unit) and ATU R (the remote termination unit).
There are up to 4 channels, each carrying an independent information flow, as shown in the figure below.
#4 carried over the line Figure 2: General topology for an ADSL/ADSL2/ADSL2  Line 2.7.
Counters, Interval Buckets, and Thresholds 2.7.1.
Counters Managed There are various types of counters specified in this MIB.
Each counter refers either to the whole ADSL/ADSL2/ADSL2  line, to one of the XTU entities, or to one of the bearer channels.
On the whole line level For full initializations, failed full initializations, short initializations, and failed short initializations, there are event counters, current 15 minute and 0
to 96 15 minute history bucket(s) of "interval counters", as well as current and 0 to 30 previous 1 day interval counter(s).
Each current 15 minute "failed" event bucket has an associated threshold notification.
On the XTU level For the LOS Seconds, ES, SES, FEC seconds, and UAS, there are event counters, current 15 minute and 0 to 96 15 minute history bucket(s) of "interval counters", as well as current and 0 to 30 previous 1 day interval counter(s).
Each current 15 minute event bucket has an associated threshold notification.
On the bearer channel level For the coding violations (CRC anomalies) and corrected blocks (i.e., FEC events), there are event counters, current 15 minute and 0 to 96 15 minute history bucket(s) of "interval counters", as well as current and 0 to 30 previous 1 day interval counter(s).
Each current 15 minute event bucket has an associated threshold notification.
Although it is possible to support up to 96 15 minute history buckets of "interval counters", systems implementing this MIB module SHOULD practically support at least 16 buckets, as specified in ITU T G.997.1, paragraph 7.2.7.2.
Similarly, it is possible to support up to 30 previous 1 day "interval counters", but systems implementing this MIB module SHOULD support at least 1 previous day bucket.
There is no requirement for an agent to ensure a fixed relationship between the start of a 15 minute interval and any wall clock; however, some implementations may align the 15 minute intervals with quarter hours.
Likewise, an implementation may choose to align one day intervals with the start of a day.
Counters are not reset when an XTU is reinitialized, only when the agent is reset or reinitialized (or under specific request outside the scope of this MIB module).
Validity As in RFC 3593
[RFC2662], in case the data for an interval is suspect or known to be invalid, the agent MUST report the interval as invalid.
If the current 15 minute event bucket is determined to be invalid, the element management system SHOULD ignore its content, and the agent MUST NOT generate notifications based upon the value of the event bucket.
A valid 15 minute event bucket SHOULD usually count the events for exactly 15 minutes.
Similarly, a valid 1 day event bucket SHOULD usually count the events for exactly 24 hours.
However, the following scenarios are exceptional: 1)
For implementations that align the 15 minute intervals with quarter hours, and the 1 day intervals with start of a day, the management system may still start the PM process not aligned with the wall clock.
Such a management system may wish to retrieve even partial information for the first event buckets, rather than declaring them all as invalid.
For an event bucket that suffered relatively short outages, the management system may wish to retrieve the available PM outcomes, rather than declare the whole event bucket as invalid.
This is more important for 1 day event buckets.
An event bucket may be shorter or longer than the formal duration if a clock adjustment was performed during the interval.
This MIB allows supporting the exceptional scenarios described above by reporting the actual Monitoring Time of a monitoring interval.
This parameter is relevant only for Valid intervals, but is useful for these exceptional scenarios: a)
The management system MAY still declare a partial PM interval as Valid and report the actual number of seconds the interval lasted.
If the interval was shortened or extended due to clock corrections, the management system SHOULD report the actual number of seconds the interval lasted, besides reporting that the interval is Valid.
As a managed node can handle a large number of XTUs, (e.g., hundreds or perhaps thousands of lines), provisioning every parameter on every XTU may become burdensome.
Moreover, most lines are provisioned identically with the same set of parameters.
To simplify the provisioning process, this MIB module makes use of profiles and templates.
A configuration profile is a set of parameters that can be shared by multiple entities.
There are configuration profiles to address the line level provisioning, and another type of profile that addresses the channel level provisioning parameters.
A configuration template is actually a profile of profiles.
That is, a template is comprised of one line configuration profile and one or more channel configuration profiles.
A template provides the complete configuration of a line.
The same configuration can be shared by multiple lines.
Similarly to the configuration profiles and templates, this MIB module makes use of templates and profiles for specifying the alarm thresholds associated with performance parameters.
This allows provisioning multiple lines with the same criteria for generating threshold crossing notifications.
The following paragraphs describe templates and profiles used in this MIB module 2.8.1.
Line Configuration Profiles Line configuration profiles contain parameters for configuring the low layer of ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2  lines.
They are defined in the adsl2LineConfProfTable.
The line configuration includes issues such as the specific ADSL/ADSL2 or ADSL2  modes to enable on the respective line, power spectrum parameters, rate adaptation criteria, and SNR margin  related parameters.
A subset of the line configuration parameters depends upon the specific ADSL Mode allowed (i.e., Does the profile allow ADSL, ADSL2, and/or ADSL2 ) as well as what annex/annexes of the standard are allowed.
This is the reason a line profile MUST include one or more mode specific extensions.
Channel Configuration Profiles Channel configuration profiles contain parameters for configuring bearer channels over the ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2  lines.
They are sometimes considered the service layer configuration of the ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2  lines.
They are defined in the adsl2ChConfProfTable.
The channel configuration includes issues such as the desired minimum and maximum rate on each traffic flow direction and impulse noise protection parameters.
Line Configuration Templates Line configuration templates allow combining line configuration profiles and channel configuration profiles to a comprehensive configuration of the ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2  line.
They are defined in the adsl2LineConfTemplateTable.
The line configuration template includes one index (OID) of a line configuration profile and one to four indexes of channel configuration profiles.
The template also addresses the issue of distributing the excess available data rate on each traffic flow direction (i.e., the data rate left after each channel is allocated a data rate to satisfy its minimum requested data rate) among the various channels.
Alarm Configuration Profiles and Templates  Line Alarm Configuration Profiles Line level Alarm configuration profiles contain the threshold values for Performance Monitoring (PM) parameters, counted either on the whole line level or on an XTU level.
Thresholds are required only for failures and anomalies, e.g., there are thresholds for failed initializations and LOS seconds, but not for the aggregate number of full initializations.
These profiles are defined in the adsl2LineAlarmConfProfileTable.
Channel Alarm Configuration Profiles Channel level Alarm configuration profiles contain the threshold values for PM parameters counted on a bearer channel level.
Thresholds are defined for two types of anomalies: corrected blocks and coding violations.
These profiles are defined in the adsl2ChAlarmConfProfileTable.
Line Alarm Configuration Templates Line Alarm configuration templates allow combining line level alarm configuration profiles and channel level alarm configuration profiles to a comprehensive configuration of the PM thresholds for ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2  line.
They are defined in the adsl2LineAlarmConfTemplateTable.
The line alarm configuration template includes one index (OID) of a line level alarm configuration profile and one to four indexes of channel level alarm configuration profiles.
Managing Profiles and Templates The index value for each profile and template is a locally unique, administratively assigned name having the textual convention 'SnmpAdminString' (RFC 3411 [RFC3411]).
One or more lines may be configured to share parameters of a single configuration template (e.g., adsl2LConfTempTemplateName   'silver') by setting its adsl2LineCnfgTemplate objects to the value of this template.
One or more lines may be configured to share parameters of a single Alarm configuration template (e.g., adsl2LAlarmConfTempTemplateName   'silver') by setting its adsl2LineAlarmCnfgTemplate objects to the value of this template.
Before a template can be deleted or taken out of service, it MUST first be unreferenced from all associated lines.
Implementations MAY also reject template modification while it is associated with any line.
Before a profile can be deleted or taken out of service, it MUST first be unreferenced from all associated templates.
Implementations MAY also reject profile modification while it is referenced by any template.
Implementations MUST provide a default profile whose name is 'DEFVAL' for each profile and template type.
The values of the associated parameters will be vendor specific unless otherwise indicated in this document.
Before a line's templates have been set, these templates will be automatically used by setting adsl2LineCnfgTemplate and adsl2LineAlarmCnfgTemplate to 'DEFVAL' where appropriate.
This default profile name, 'DEFVAL', is considered reserved in the context of profiles and templates defined in this MIB module.
Profiles and templates are created, assigned, and deleted dynamically using the profile name and profile row status in each of the profile tables.
If the implementation allows modifying a profile or template while it is associated with a line, then such changes MUST take effect immediately.
These changes MAY result in a restart (hard reset or soft restart) of the units on the line.
The number of bearer channels is configured by setting the template attributes adsl2LConfTempChan1ConfProfile, adsl2LConfTempChan2ConfProfile, adsl2LConfTempChan3ConfProfile, and adsl2LConfTempChan4ConfProfile and then assigning that template to a DSL line using the adsl2LineCnfgTemplate attribute.
When the number of bearer channels for a DSL line changes, the SNMP agent will automatically create or destroy rows in channel related tables associated with that line.
For example, when a DSL line is operating with one bearer channel, there will be zero rows in channel related tables for channels two, three, and four.
The SNMP agent MUST create and destroy channel related rows as follows:
When the number of bearer channels for a DSL line changes to a higher number, the SNMP agent will automatically create rows in the adsl2ChannelStatusTable, and adsl2PMChCurrTable tables for that line.
When the number of bearer channels for a DSL line changes to a lower number, the SNMP agent will automatically destroy rows in the adsl2ChannelStatusTable, adsl2PMChCurrTable, adsl2PMChHist15MinTable, and adsl2PMChHist1DTable tables for that line.
The ability to generate the SNMP notifications coldStart/warmStart (per [RFC3418]), which are per agent (e.g., per Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer, or DSLAM, in such a device), and linkUp/linkDown (per [RFC2863]), which are per interface (i.e., ADSL/ADSL2 or ADSL2  line), is REQUIRED.
A linkDown notification MAY be generated whenever any of ES, SES, CRC Anomaly, LOS, LOF, or UAS event occurs.
The corresponding linkUp notification MAY be sent when all link failure conditions are cleared.
The notifications defined in this MIB module are for status change (e.g., initialization failure) and for the threshold crossings associated with the following events: full initialization failures, short initialization failures, ES, SES, FEC Seconds, LOS Seconds, UAS, FEC Seconds, FEC events, and CRC anomalies.
Each threshold has its own enable/threshold value.
When that value is 0, the notification is disabled.
The adsl2LineStatusAtur and adsl2LineStatusAtuc are bitmasks representing all outstanding error conditions associated with the ATU R and ATU C (respectively).
Note that since the ATU R status is obtained via the EOC, this information may be unavailable in case the ATU R is unreachable via EOC during a line error condition.
Therefore, not all conditions may always be included in its current status.
Notifications corresponding to the bit fields in those two status objects are defined.
Note that there are other status parameters that refer to the ATU R (e.g., downstream line attenuation).
Those parameters also depend on the availability of EOC between the ATU C and the ATU R. A threshold notification occurs whenever the corresponding current 15 minute interval error counter becomes equal to or exceeds the threshold value.
Only one notification SHOULD be sent per interval per interface.
Since the current 15 minute counter is reset to 0 every 15 minutes, if the condition persists, the notification may recur as often as every 15 minutes.
For example, to get a notification whenever a "loss of" event occurs (but at most once every 15 minutes), set the corresponding threshold to 1.
The agent will generate a notification when the event originally occurs.
Notifications, other than the threshold notifications listed above, SHOULD be rate limited (throttled)
such that there is an implementation specific gap between the generation of consecutive notifications of the same event.
When notifications are rate  limited, they are dropped and not queued for sending at a future time.
This is intended to be a general rate limiting statement for notifications that otherwise have no explicit rate limiting assertions in this document.
Note that the Network Management System, or NMS, may receive a linkDown notification, as well, if enabled (via ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable [RFC2863]).
At the beginning of the next 15 minute interval, the counter is reset.
When the first second goes by and the event occurs, the current interval bucket will be 1, which equals the threshold, and the notification will be sent again.

61 3 9264 3385 " DESCRIPTION "
This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in the Internet community for the purpose of managing ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2  lines.
The MIB module described in RFC 2662
[RFC2662] describes objects used for managing Asymmetric Bit Rate DSL (ADSL) interfaces per [T1E1.413], [G.992.1], and [G.992.2].
These object descriptions are based upon the specifications for the ADSL Embedded Operations Channel (EOC) as defined in American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
T1E1.413/1995 [T1E1.413] and International Telecommunication Union (ITU T)
This document does not obsolete RFC 2662
[RFC2662], but rather provides a more comprehensive management model that includes the ADSL2 and ADSL2  technologies per G.992.3, G.992.4, and G.992.5 ([G.992.3], [G.992.4], and [G.992.5], respectively).
In addition, objects have been added to improve the management of ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2  lines.
Additionally, the management framework for New Generation ADSL lines specified by the Digital Subscriber Line Forum (DSLF) has been taken into consideration [TR 90].
That framework is based on ITU T G.997.1 standard [G.997.1] as well as two amendments:
Note that the revised ITU T G.997.1 standard also refers to the next generation of VDSL technology, known as VDSL2, per ITU T G.993.2
However, managing VDSL2 lines is currently beyond the scope of this document.
The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2 transmission, as discussed in the IANA Considerations section of this document.
This version of this MIB module is part of RFC 4706: see the RFC itself for full legal notices."
October 4th, 2006 DESCRIPTION "Initial version, published as RFC 4706."
The table adsl2LineTable contains configuration, command, and status parameters of the ADSL2 line.
The index of this table is an interface index where the interface has an ifType of adsl2plus(238).
Several objects in this table MUST be maintained in a persistent manner."
MAX ACCESS  read write STATUS
"The value of this object identifies the row in the ADSL2 Line Configuration Templates Table, (adsl2LineConfTemplateTable), which applies for this ADSL2 line.
This object MUST be maintained in a persistent manner."
MAX ACCESS  read write STATUS
"The value of this object identifies the row in the ADSL2 Line Alarm Configuration Template Table, (adsl2LineAlarmConfTemplateTable), which applies to this ADSL2 line.
This object MUST be maintained in a persistent manner."
current DESCRIPTION "Power management state forced.
Defines the line states to be forced by the near end ATU on this line.
The various possible values are: l3toL0(0), l0toL2(2), or l0orL2toL3(3).
This object MUST be maintained in a persistent manner."
3 } adsl2LineCmndConfLdsf  OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
Loop diagnostics mode forced (LDSF).
Defines whether the line should be forced into the loop diagnostics mode by the near end ATU on this line or only be responsive to loop diagnostics initiated by the far end ATU.
This object MUST be maintained in a persistent manner.
However, in case the operator forces loop diagnostics mode then the access node should reset the object (inhibit) when loop diagnostics mode procedures are completed."
The status of the recent occasion the Loop diagnostics mode forced (LDSF) was issued for the associated line.
The default value in case LDSF was never requested for the associated line.
The recent command completed successfully.
The Loop Diagnostics process is in progress.
The NE or the line card doesn't support LDSF.
The NE cannot initiate the command, due to a nonspecific reason.
The Loop Diagnostics process aborted.
The Loop Diagnostics process failed.
The NE cannot initiate the command, due to the specific mode of the relevant line.
The NE cannot initiate the command, as the relevant line is administratively 'Up'.
The NE cannot initiate the command, due to reaching the maximum number of rows in the results table.
The NE cannot initiate the command, due to lack of internal memory resources.
This parameter is defined in order to improve testing of the performance of ATUs supporting automode when it is enabled in the MIB.
Change the value of this parameter to 'true' indicates a change in loop conditions applied to the devices under test.
The ATUs shall reset any historical information used for automode and for shortening G.994.1 handshake and initialization.
Automode is the case where multiple operation modes are enabled through the adsl2LConfProfAtuTransSysEna object in the line configuration profile being used for the ADSL line, and where the selection of the actual operation mode depends not only on the common capabilities of both ATUs (as exchanged in G.994.1), but also on achievable data rates under given loop conditions.
This object MUST be maintained in a persistent manner."
"ITU T G.997.1 (amendment 1), 7.3.1.1.10
The ATU Transmission System (ATS) in use.
It is coded in a bit map representation with only a single bit set to '1' (the selected coding for the ADSL line).

"The table adsl2SCStatusTable contains status parameters of the ADSL2 sub carriers.
The following points apply to this table: 1.
The main purpose of this table is to hold the results of a DELT.
This table also holds parameters obtained at line initialization time.
The rows in this table are volatile; that is, they are lost if the SNMP agent is rebooted.
Due to the large OCTET STRING attributes in this table, the worst case memory requirements for this table are very high.
The manager may use the row status attribute of this table to delete rows in order to reclaim memory.
The manager may create rows in this table.
The SNMP agent may create rows in this table.
Only the manager may delete rows in this table.
The maximum number of rows allowable in this table is indicated by the scalar attribute adsl2ScalarSCMaxInterfaces.
The number of rows available in this table is indicated by the scalar attribute adsl2ScalarSCAvailInterfaces.
The SNMP agent is permitted to create rows in this table when a DELT completes successfully or when line initialization occurs.
It is not mandatory for the SNMP agent to create rows in this table; hence, it may be necessary for the manager to create rows in this table before any results can be stored.
If the manager attempts to create a row in this table and there are no more rows available, the creation attempt will fail, and the response to the SNMP SET PDU will contain the error noCreation(11).
If the SNMP agent attempts to create a row in this table and there are no more rows available, the creation attempt will fail, and the attribute adsl2LineCmndConfLdsfFailReason will indicate the reason for the failure.
The failure reason will be either tableFull(10) or noResources(11).
An example of use of this table is as follows: Step 1.
: The DELT is started by setting the : adsl2LineCmndConfLdsf from inhibit to force.
: The DELT completes, and valid data is : available.
The row in the adsl2SCStatusTable where the : results will be stored does not yet exist so : the SNMP agent attempts to create the row.
: Due to a low memory condition, a row in the : adsl2SCStatusTable table cannot be created at : this time.
: The reason for the failure, tableFull(10), is : indicated in the adsl2LineCmndConfLdsfFailReason : attribute.
Another example of use of this table is as follows : Step 1.
: The DELT is started by setting the : adsl2LineCmndConfLdsf from inhibit to force.
: The DELT completes and valid data is : available.
The row in the adsl2SCStatusTable where the : results will be stored does not yet exist so : the SNMP agent attempts to create the row.
: The row creation is successful.
The value of the attribute : adsl2LineCmndConfLdsfFailReasonreason is set : to success(2).
Another example of use of this table is as follows: Step 1.
: The manager creates a row in adsl2SCStatusTable : for a particular ADSL2 line.
: The DELT is started on the above mentioned : line by setting the adsl2LineCmndConfLdsf from : inhibit to force.
: The DELT completes, and valid data is : available.
The value of the attribute : adsl2LineCmndConfLdsfFailReasonreason is set : to success(2)."
"The table Adsl2SCStatusEntry contains status parameters of the ADSL2 sub carriers.

The SNR Margin per sub carrier, expressing the ratio between the received signal power and received noise power per subscriber.
It is an array of 512 octets, designed for supporting up to 512 (downstream) sub carriers.

A management application intended to manage ADSL links (e.g., G.992.1) with this MIB module must be modified to adapt itself to certain differences between RFC 2662 [RFC2662] and this MIB module, including the following aspects:  Although the configuration templates/profiles allow referring to 1 4 bearer channels, ADSL links are limited to 2 channels at most.
Although the channel configuration profile allows higher data rates, ADSL links are limited to downstream/upstream data rates as assumed in RFC 2662 [RFC2662].
The Impulse Noise Protection (INP) configuration parameters are given by minimum protection and maximum delay parameters.
The line configuration profile includes a sub table that addresses mode specific parameters.
For ADSL links, the management application SHOULD create a row in that table for the 'adsl' mode.
The line configuration profile includes parameters that are irrelevant for ADSL links.
Similarly, many status parameters in the MIB are irrelevant for certain ADSL modes.
Therefore, it is advised to consult with ITU G.997.1 standard [G.997.1] regarding the scope and relevance of each parameter in this MIB.
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:  adsl2LineTable
adsl2LineCmndConfPmsf    adsl2LineCmndConfLdsf    adsl2LineCmndAutomodeColdStart Unauthorized changes to adsl2LineCnfgTemplate could have a major adverse operational effect on many lines simultaneously.
Unauthorized changes to adsl2LineAlarmCnfgTemplate could have a contrary effect on notifications.
Unauthorized changes to adsl2LineCmndConfPmsf could have an adverse affect on the power consumption of a line and may disrupt an operational service.
Unauthorized changes to adsl2LineCmndConfLdsf could cause an unscheduled line test to be carried out on the line.
Unauthorized changes to adsl2LineCmndAutomodeColdStart could cause an unscheduled cold reset to the line.
This table contains one object, adsl2SCStatusRowStatus, that supports SET operations.
Unauthorized changes could result in line test results being deleted prematurely.
The table consists of the following objects that support SET operations:
adsl2LConfTempRowStatus Unauthorized changes to adsl2LConfTempLineProfile, adsl2LConfTempChan1ConfProfile, adsl2LConfTempChan2ConfProfile, adsl2LConfTempChan3ConfProfile, or adsl2LConfTempChan4ConfProfile could have an adverse operational effect on several lines; could change several lines over to running in unwanted levels of operation; or could result in several services undergoing changes in the number of channels that carry the service.
Unauthorized changes to adsl2LConfTempChan1RaRatioDs, adsl2LConfTempChan2RaRatioDs, adsl2LConfTempChan3RaRatioDs, or adsl2LConfTempChan4RaRatioDs, would alter the relative rate allocations among all channels belonging to a line.
This could have an adverse operational effect on several lines.
Unauthorized changes to adsl2LConfTempRowStatus could result in templates being created or brought into service prematurely; or could result in templates being inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.
adsl2LConfProfRowStatus Unauthorized changes resulting in the setting of any of the above objects to an incorrect value could have an adverse operational effect on several lines.
Also, unauthorized changes to adsl2LConfProfRowStatus could result in unwanted line profiles being created or brought into service prematurely; or could result in line profiles being inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.
adsl2LConfProfModeSpecRowStatus Unauthorized changes resulting in the setting of any of the above objects to an incorrect value could have an adverse operational effect on several lines.
Also, unauthorized changes to adsl2LConfProfModeSpecRowStatus could result in unwanted PSD configurations being created or brought into service prematurely; or could result in PSD configurations being inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.
adsl2ChConfProfImaEnabled    adsl2ChConfProfRowStatus Unauthorized changes resulting in the setting of any of the above objects to an incorrect value could have an adverse operational effect on several lines.
Also, unauthorized changes to adsl2ChConfProfRowStatus could result in unwanted channel profiles being created or brought into service prematurely; or could result in channel profiles being inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.
adsl2LAlarmConfTempRowStatus Unauthorized changes to adsl2LAlarmConfTempLineProfile, adsl2LAlarmConfTempChan1ConfProfile, adsl2LAlarmConfTempChan2ConfProfile, adsl2LAlarmConfTempChan3ConfProfile, or
adsl2LAlarmConfTempChan4ConfProfile could have an adverse effect on the management of notifications generated at the scope of several to many lines; or could change several to many lines over to running with unwanted management rates for generated notifications.
Unauthorized changes to adsl2LAlarmConfTempRowStatus could result in alarm templates being created or brought into service prematurely; or could result in alarm templates being inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.
Increasing any of the threshold values could result in a notification being suppressed or deferred.
Setting a threshold to 0 could result in a notification being suppressed.
Suppressing or deferring a notification could prevent the timely delivery of important diagnostic information.
Decreasing any of the threshold values could result in a notification being sent from the network falsely reporting a threshold crossing.
Changing a threshold value could also have an impact on the amount of notifications the agent sends.
The Notifications Section of this document has a paragraph that provides general guidance on the rate limiting of notifications.
Agent implementations not providing rate limiting could result in notifications being generated at an uncontrolled rate.
Unauthorized changes to a threshold value could result in an undesired notification rate.
Unauthorized changes to row status could result in unwanted line alarm profiles being created or brought into service.
Also, changes to the row status could result in line alarm profiles being inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.

Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
adsl2LineInventoryTable Access to these objects would allow an intruder to obtain information about which vendor's equipment is in use on the network.
Further, such information is considered sensitive in many environments for competitive reasons.
adsl2LInvTransmissionCapabilities SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], Section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
It is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access only to those objects whose principals (users) have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
