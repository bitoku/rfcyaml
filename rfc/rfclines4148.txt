Abstract This memo defines a registry for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM).
It assigns and registers an initial set of OBJECT IDENTITIES to currently defined metrics in the IETF.
This memo also defines the rules for adding IP Performance Metrics that are defined in the future and for encouraging all IP performance metrics to be registered here.
IANA has been assigned to administer this new registry.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
This memo defines a registry of the current metrics and a framework for the integration of future metrics for the following reasons:  to permit metrics to be clearly referenced by MIB modules or other data models;  to provide metrics identifiers for measurement interoperability;  to take special care with the integration of future standardized metrics because it is a continuous process;  to provide room where other standards bodies can register their metrics in order to encourage IP performance metrics to have OBJECT IDENTITIES rooted at a common point because the intent of the IPPM WG is to cooperate with other appropriate standards bodies (or fora) to promote consistent metrics;  and, similarly, to provide room for enterprises to register metrics.
IP Performance Metrics Registry Framework MIB modules need to be able to reference IPPM Metrics precisely.
The registry associates an OBJECT IDENTITY with each metric.
One way Delay and Type P
One way Delay Poisson Stream have different OBJECT IDENTITIES.
The registry has one branch.
Metrics are identified in the 'ianaIppmMetrics' subtree.
This document defines an initial registry of the existing metrics defined in the IPPM WG and the rules to manage the registry.
Documents defining metrics in the future will include in the IANA section the registration information to identify these metrics unambiguously.
Initial IPPM Metrics Registry Creation
The initial registry identifies the metrics currently defined in the RFCs produced in the IPPM WG.
To date, the IPPM WG defined 33 metrics related to the following 7 topics: 1.
IPPM Metrics for Measuring Connectivity, RFC 2678 [RFC2678] 2.
One way Delay Metrics, RFC 2679 [RFC2679] 3.
One way Packet Loss Metrics, RFC 2680
Round trip Delay Metrics, RFC 2681
One way Loss Pattern Sample Metrics, RFC 3357 [RFC3357] 6.
IP Packet Delay Variation Metric, RFC 3393
IPPM Metrics for periodic streams, RFC 3432
These are sequentially registered in the node ianaIppmMetrics.
The naming conventions used for the existing metrics, and encouraged for new IPPM metrics, are:  Metrics names conform SMIv2 rules for descriptors defined in section 3.1 of [RFC2578];
This section describes the rules for the management of the registry by IANA.
Management Rules Registrations are done sequentially by IANA in the ianaIppmMetrics subtree on the basis of 'Specification Required', as defined in [RFC2434].
The reference of the specification must point to a stable document including a title, a revision, and a date.
The name always starts with the name of the organization and must respect the SMIv2 rules for descriptors defined in section 3.1 of [RFC2578].
A document that creates new metrics would have an "IANA Considerations" section in which it would describe new metrics to be registered.
An OBJECT IDENTITY assigned to a metric is definitive and cannot be reused.
If a new version of a metric is produced, then it is assigned with a new name and a new identifier.
The following is a proposed template to insert in the IANA considerations section.
For each metric, that section would instantiate the following statement: IANA has registed the following metric in the IANA IPPM METRICS

This module does not define any management objects.
Instead, it assigns a set of OBJECT IDENTITIES which may be used by other MIB modules to identify specific IP Performance Metrics.
Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB modules that define management objects.
This document has therefore no impact on the security of the Internet.
