  contents:
  - "Status of this Memo\n   This RFC describes an existing print server protocol\
    \ widely used on\n   the Internet for communicating between line printer daemons\
    \ (both\n   clients and servers).  This memo is for informational purposes only,\n\
    \   and does not specify an Internet standard.  Please refer to the\n   current\
    \ edition of the \"IAB Official Protocol Standards\" for the\n   standardization\
    \ state and status of this protocol.  Distribution of\n   this memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The Berkeley versions of the Unix(tm) operating system provide\
    \ line\n   printer spooling with a collection of programs: lpr (assign to\n  \
    \ queue), lpq (display the queue), lprm (remove from queue), and lpc\n   (control\
    \ the queue).  These programs interact with an autonomous\n   process called the\
    \ line printer daemon.  This RFC describes the\n   protocols with which a line\
    \ printer daemon client may control\n   printing.\n   This memo is based almost\
    \ entirely on the work of Robert Knight at\n   Princeton University.  I gratefully\
    \ acknowledge his efforts in\n   deciphering the UNIX lpr protocol and producing\
    \ earlier versions of\n   this document.\n"
- title: 2. Model of Printing Environment
  contents:
  - "2. Model of Printing Environment\n   A group of hosts request services from a\
    \ line printer daemon process\n   running on a host.  The services provided by\
    \ the process are related\n   to printing jobs.  A printing job produces output\
    \ from one file.\n   Each job will have a unique job number which is between 0\
    \ and 999,\n   inclusive.  The jobs are requested by users which have names. \
    \ These\n   user names may not start with a digit.\n"
- title: 3. Specification of the Protocol
  contents:
  - "3. Specification of the Protocol\n   The specification includes file formats\
    \ for the control and data\n   files as well as messages used by the protocol.\n"
- title: 3.1 Message formats
  contents:
  - "3.1 Message formats\n   LPR is a a TCP-based protocol.  The port on which a line\
    \ printer\n   daemon listens is 515.  The source port must be in the range 721\
    \ to\n   731, inclusive.  A line printer daemon responds to commands send to\n\
    \   its port.  All commands begin with a single octet code, which is a\n   binary\
    \ number which represents the requested function.  The code is\n   immediately\
    \ followed by the ASCII name of the printer queue name on\n   which the function\
    \ is to be performed.  If there are other operands\n   to the command, they are\
    \ separated from the printer queue name with\n   white space (ASCII space, horizontal\
    \ tab, vertical tab, and form\n   feed).  The end of the command is indicated\
    \ with an ASCII line feed\n   character.\n"
- title: 4. Diagram Conventions
  contents:
  - "4. Diagram Conventions\n   The diagrams in the rest of this RFC use these conventions.\
    \  These\n   diagrams show the format of an octet stream sent to the server. \
    \ The\n   outermost box represents this stream.  Each box within the outermost\n\
    \   one shows one portion of the stream.  If the contents of the box is\n   two\
    \ decimal digits, this indicates that the binary 8 bit value is to\n   be used.\
    \  If the contents is two uppercase letters, this indicates\n   that the corresponding\
    \ ASCII control character is to be used.  An\n   exception to this is that the\
    \ character SP can be interpreted as\n   white space.  (See the preceding section\
    \ for a definition.)  If the\n   contents is a single letter, the ASCII code for\
    \ this letter must be\n   sent.  Otherwise, the contents are intended to be mnemonic\
    \ of the\n   contents of the field which is a sequence of octets.\n"
- title: 5. Daemon commands
  contents:
  - "5. Daemon commands\n   The verbs in the command names should be interpreted as\
    \ statements\n   made to the daemon.  Thus, the command \"Print any waiting jobs\"\
    \ is an\n   imperative to the line printer daemon to which it is sent.  A new\n\
    \   connection must be made for each command to be given to the daemon.\n"

    \   The commands are described in the next section (6).\n   After this command\
    \ is sent, the client must read an acknowledgement\n   octet from the daemon.\

    \ the receive data file and receive\n   control file subcommands in either order.\

    \ is\n   sent as the first operand.  The name of the control file is sent as\n\

    \ job number, followed by the host name which has constructed the\n   control\
    \ file.  Acknowledgement processing must occur as usual after\n   the command\
    \ is sent.\n   The next \"Operand 1\" octets over the same TCP connection are\

    \ total number\n   of bytes in the stream may be sent as the first operand, otherwise\n\
    \   the field should be cleared to 0.  The name of the data file should\n   start\

    \  The job number should be followed by the host name which has\n   constructed\
    \ the data file.  Interpretation of the contents of the\n   data file is determined\
    \ by the contents of the corresponding control\n   file.  If a data file length\
    \ has been specified, the next \"Operand 1\"\n   octets over the same TCP connection\

- title: 7. Control file lines
  contents:
  - "7. Control file lines\n   This section  discusses the format of  the lines in\
    \ the  control file\n   which is sent to the line printer daemon.\n   Each line\
    \ of the control file consists of a single, printable ASCII\n   character which\
    \ represents a function to be performed when the file\n   is printed.  Interpretation\
    \ of these command characters are case-\n   sensitive.  The rest of the line after\
    \ the command character is the\n   command's operand.  No leading white space\
    \ is permitted after the\n   command character.  The line ends with an ASCII new\
    \ line.\n   Those commands which have a lower case letter as a command code are\n\
    \   used to specify an actual printing request.  The commands which use\n   upper\
    \ case are used to describe parametric values or background\n   conditions.\n\
    \   Some commands must be included in every control file.  These are 'H'\n   (responsible\
    \ host) and 'P' (responsible user).  Additionally, there\n   must be at least\
    \ one lower case command to produce any output.\n"
