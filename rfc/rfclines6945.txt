This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines objects used for monitoring the RPKI Router Protocol [RFC6810].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579], and
The objects defined in this document are used to monitor the RPKI  Router Protocol [RFC6810].
The MIB module defined here is broken into these tables: the RPKI Router Cache Server (Connection) Table, the RPKI Router Cache Server Errors Table, and the RPKI Router Prefix Origin Table.
The RPKI Router Cache Server Table contains information about the state and current activity of connections with the RPKI router cache servers.
It also contains counters for the number of messages received and sent, plus the number of announcements, withdrawals, and active records.
The RPKI Router Cache Server Errors Table contains counters of occurrences of errors on the connections (if any).
The RPKI Router Prefix Origin Table contains IP prefixes with their minimum and maximum prefix lengths and the Origin Autonomous System (AS).
This data is the collective set of information received from all RPKI cache servers that the router is connected with.
The cache servers are running the RPKI Router Protocol.
Two notifications have been defined to inform a Network Management Station (NMS) or operators about changes in the connection state of the connections listed in the RPKI Router Cache Server (Connection) Table.
The following MIB module imports definitions from [RFC2578], [RFC2579], [RFC2580], [RFC4001], and [RFC2287].
That means we have a normative reference to each of those documents.
The MIB module also has a normative reference to the RPKI Router Protocol [RFC6810].
Furthermore, for background and informative information, the MIB module refers to [RFC1982], [RFC4252], [RFC5246], and [RFC5925].

"This timer represents the timestamp (value of sysUpTime) at which time any of the Counter32 objects in this MIB module encountered a discontinuity.
For objects that use rpkiRtrDiscontinuityTimer to indicate discontinuity, only values received since the time indicated by rpkiRtrDiscontinuityTimer are comparable to each other.
A manager should take the possibility of rollover into account when calculating difference values.
In principle, that should only happen if the SNMP agent or the instrumentation for this MIB module starts or restarts."

IANA Considerations IANA has assigned the MIB module in this document the following OBJECT IDENTIFIER within the SMI Numbers registry.
There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
So, if this MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB module via direct SNMP SET operations.
Most of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
They are vulnerable in the sense that when an intruder sees the information in this MIB module, then it might help him/her to set up an attack on the router or cache server.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
Implementations MUST provide the security features described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), including full support for authentication and privacy via the User based Security Model (USM)
[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
