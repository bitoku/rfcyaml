  - "1.  Introduction\n   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC 3761 [1]) is a system that
    transforms\n   E.164 numbers [2] into domain names and then uses DNS (RFC 1034
    [3])\n   features such as delegation through NS records, and the use of Naming\n
    \  Authority Pointer (NAPTR) records, to look up the communication\n   services
    available for a specific domain name.\n   This document registers an Enumservice
    according to the guidelines\n   given in RFC 3761 to be used for provisioning
    in the services field\n   of a NAPTR [4] resource record to indicate what class
    of\n   functionality a given endpoint offers.  The registration is defined\n   within
    the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS, [5] [6] [4] [7]\n   [8]) hierarchy,
    for use with the \"E2U\" DDDS application defined in\n   RFC 3761.\n   Enumservices
    have a type and subtype.  This latter is optional, as it\n   may be implicit in
    the service type.  The type defines the kind of\n   communication session that
    can be initiated using the contact\n   indicated by the URI generated by the enclosing
    NAPTR.  In\n   telecommunications engineering terms, it reflects the \"teleservice\".\n
    \  The subtype defines the subsystem that is to be used to initiate the\n   communication
    session.  Note that the subtype definition is usually\n   associated with the
    URI scheme that is to be used.\n   Both the type and subtype (where present) must
    be supported for the\n   NAPTR to be used by a potential correspondent.\n   There
    are a number of DDDS applications in addition to ENUM (for\n   example, see [7]
    and [8]).  However, an Enumservice indication\n   operates only within the context
    of the \"E2U\" (ENUM) DDDS\n   Application.\n   Whilst the protocol elements that
    make up ENUM are defined in the\n   above documents and in this one, further examples
    of the use to which\n   these may be put are given in other documents, for example,
    in ETSI\n   TS 102 172 [11].\n   This document registers the Enumservice \"voice\"
    (which has a defined\n   subtype \"tel\"), as per the IANA registration process
    defined in the\n   ENUM specification RFC 3761.  This service indicates that the
    contact\n   held in the generated URI can be used to initiate an interactive\n
    \  voice (audio) call.\n"

    Type: \"voice\"\n   Enumservice Subtype: \"tel\"\n   URI Scheme: 'tel:'\n   Functional
    Specification:\n      The kind of communication indicated by this Enumservice
    is\n      \"Interactive Voice\".  From a protocol perspective, this\n      communication
    is expected to involve bidirectional media streams\n      carrying audio data.\n
    \     A client may imply that the person controlling population of a\n      NAPTR
    holding this Enumservice indicates his capability to engage\n      in an interactive
    voice session when contacted using the URI\n      generated by this NAPTR.\n   Security
    Considerations:\n      See Section 5.\n   Intended Usage: COMMON\n   Authors:\n
    \     Rudolf Brandner, Lawrence Conroy, and Richard Stastny (for author\n      contact
    detail, see Authors' Addresses section)\n   Any other information the author deems
    interesting:\n      This Enumservice indicates that the person responsible for
    the\n      NAPTR is accessible via the Public Switched Telephone Network\n      (PSTN)
    or Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) using the value of the\n      generated URI.\n
    \     The kind of subsystem required to initiate a Voice Enumservice\n      with
    this subtype is a \"Dialer\".  This is a subsystem that either\n      provides
    a local connection to the PSTN or PLMN or provides an\n      indirect connection
    to those networks.  The subsystem will use the\n      telephone number held in
    the generated URI to place a voice call.\n      The voice call is placed to a
    network that uses E.164 numbers to\n      route calls to an appropriate destination.\n
    \     Note that the PSTN/PLMN connection may be indirect.  The end user\n      receiving
    this NAPTR may have a relationship with a Communications\n      Service Provider
    that accepts call initiation requests from that\n      subsystem using an IP-based
    protocol such as SIP or H.323, and\n      places the call to the PSTN using a
    remote gateway service.  In\n      this case, the provider either may accept requests
    using \"tel:\"\n      URIs or has a defined mechanism to convert \"tel:\" URI
    values into\n      a \"protocol-native\" form.\n      The \"tel:\" URI value SHOULD
    be fully qualified (using the \"global\n      phone number\" form of RFC 3966
    [10]).  A \"local phone number\" as\n      defined in that document SHOULD NOT
    be used unless the controller\n      of the zone in which the NAPTR appears is
    sure that it can be\n      distinguished unambiguously by all clients that can
    access the\n      resource record and that a call from their network access points\n
    \     can be routed to that destination.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   DNS, as used by ENUM, is a global, distributed
    database.  Thus, any\n   information stored there is visible to anyone anonymously.
    \ Whilst\n   this is not qualitatively different from publication in a telephone\n
    \  directory, it does open the data subjects to having \"their\"\n   information
    collected automatically without any indication that this\n   has been done or
    by whom.\n   Such data harvesting by third parties is often used to generate lists\n
    \  of targets for unrequested information; in short, they are used to\n   address
    \"spam\".  Anyone who uses a Web-archived mailing list is aware\n   that the volume
    of \"spam\" email sent increases when he or she posts\n   to the mailing list;
    publication of a telephone number in ENUM is no\n   different, and may be used
    for attempts to send \"junk faxes\" or \"junk\n   SMS\", for example.\n   Many
    mailing list users have more than one email address and use\n   \"sacrificial\"
    email accounts when posting to such lists to help\n   filter out unrequested emails
    sent to them.  This is not so easy with\n   published telephone numbers; the PSTN
    E.164 number assignment process\n   is much more involved and usually a single
    E.164 number (or a fixed\n   range of numbers) is associated with each PSTN access.
    \ Thus,\n   providing a \"sacrificial\" phone number in any publication is not\n
    \  possible.\n   Due to the implications of publishing data on a globally accessible\n
    \  database, as a principle the data subjects MUST give their explicit\n   informed
    consent to data being published in ENUM.\n   In addition, they should be made
    aware that, due to storage of such\n   data during harvesting by third parties,
    removal of the data from\n   publication will not remove any copies that have
    been taken; in\n   effect, any publication may be permanent.\n   However, regulations
    in many regions will require that the data\n   subjects can at any time request
    that the data be removed from\n   publication and that their consent for its publication
    be explicitly\n   confirmed at regular intervals.\n   When placing a voice call
    via the PSTN (or from the Public Land\n   Mobile Network), the sender may be charged
    for this action.  In both\n   kinds of networks, calling some numbers is more
    expensive than\n   sending to others; both kinds of networks have \"premium rate\"\n
    \  services that can be charged at a rate considerably more than a\n   \"normal\"
    call.  As such, it is important that end users be asked to\n   confirm placing
    the call and that the destination number be presented\n   to them.  It is the
    originating user's choice whether or not to place\n   a call to this destination
    number, but the originating user SHOULD be\n   shown the destination number so
    that he or she can make this\n   decision.\n   In addition to the specific security
    considerations given above, all\n   security considerations given in RFC 3761
    apply, as well as the\n   DNS-specific threats covered in RFC 3833 [12].\n"
