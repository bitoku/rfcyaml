    \   Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6).  The option allows a\n   DHCPv6\
    \ relay agent to request a list of relay agent options that the\n   server echoes\
    \ back to the relay agent.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   DHCPv6 [2] provides a framework for configuring IPv6 clients\
    \ with\n   addresses and other network parameters.  It includes a relay agent\n\
    \   capability.  A relay agent is an intermediary node that delivers DHCP\n  \
    \ messages between clients and servers.  The relay agent and the server\n   exchange\
    \ information using options in relay agent messages.  The\n   relay agent may\
    \ add relay agent options to the client DHCP message\n   before forwarding it.\n\
    \   The information that relay agents supply can be used in the server's\n   decision\
    \ making about the addresses, delegated prefixes, and\n   configuration parameters\
    \ that the client is to receive.  Likewise,\n   the relay may need some of the\
    \ information to efficiently return\n   replies to clients.\n   In DHCPv4, the\
    \ server generally echoes the relay agent option back\n   verbatim to the relay\
    \ agent in server-to-client replies [3].\n   However, DHCPv6 [2] does not require\
    \ the server to do so.  This could\n   be problematic, as the relay agent may\
    \ need to use some relay options\n   even if the server does not recognize them.\n\
    \   This memo defines a relay agent echo request option that the relay\n   agent\
    \ uses to explicitly request a list of options that the server\n   echoes back\
    \ to the relay agent.\n"

- title: 3.  The Relay Agent Echo Request Option
  contents:
  - "3.  The Relay Agent Echo Request Option\n   The relay agent adds options in the\
    \ Relay Forward message that the\n   server uses to guide its decision making\
    \ with regard to address\n   assignment, prefix delegation, and configuration\
    \ parameters.  The\n   relay agent also knows which of these options that it will\
    \ need to\n   efficiently return replies to the client.  It uses the relay agent\n\
    \   Echo Request option to inform the server of the list of relay agent\n   options\
    \ that the server must echo back.\n   The format of the DHCPv6 Relay Agent Echo\

- title: 4.  DHCPv6 Relay Agent Behavior
  contents:
  - "4.  DHCPv6 Relay Agent Behavior\n   A relay agent MAY include an Echo Request\
    \ option in a Relay Forward\n   message to inform the server about options the\
    \ relay agent wants the\n   server to echo back to the relay agent.  If the relay\
    \ agent takes\n   different actions based on whether an option is echoed back\
    \ or not,\n   then the relay agent SHOULD NOT include such an option in the Echo\n\
    \   Request option.  Note that the relay uses the OPTION_ORO [2] to\n   request\
    \ the server to return options (e.g., [4]) other than relay\n   agent options\
    \ in the Relay Forward message.\n"
- title: 5.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior
  contents:
  - "5.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior\n   When a server creates a Relay-Reply, it SHOULD\
    \ perform ERO processing\n   after processing the ORO and other options processing.\
    \  For each\n   option in the ERO:\n   a.  If the option is already in the Relay-Reply,\
    \ the server MUST\n       ignore that option and continue to process any remaining\
    \ options\n       in the ERO.\n   b.  If the option was not in the received Relay-Forward,\
    \ the server\n       MUST ignore that option and continue to process any remaining\n\
    \       options in the ERO.\n   c.  Otherwise, the server MUST copy the option,\
    \ verbatim, from the\n       received Relay-Forward to the Relay-Reply, even if\
    \ the server\n       does not otherwise recognize that option.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   As the Echo Request option is only exchanged\
    \ between relay agents and\n   DHCPv6 servers, section 21.1 of [2] provides details\
    \ on securing\n   DHCPv6 messages sent between servers and relay agents.  And,\
    \ section\n   23 of [2] provides general DHCPv6 security considerations.\n"
