  - "Abstract\n   This memo makes recommendations for software that automatically\n\
    \   responds to incoming electronic mail messages, including \"out of the\n  \
    \ office\" or \"vacation\" response generators, mail filtering software,\n   email-based\
    \ information services, and other automatic responders.\n   The purpose of these\
    \ recommendations is to discourage undesirable\n   behavior which is caused or\
    \ aggravated by such software, to encourage\n   uniform behavior (where appropriate)\
    \ among automatic mail responders,\n   and to clear up some sources of confusion\
    \ among implementors of\n   automatic email responders.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Many programs which automatically respond to email are currently\
    \ in\n   use.  Although these programs vary widely in their function, several\n\
    \   problems with this class of programs have been observed, including:\n   significant\
    \ numbers of useless or unwanted response and responses\n   sent to inappropriate\
    \ addresses, and occasional incidences of mail\n   loops or \"sorcerer's apprentice\"\
    \ mode.  This memo recommends behavior\n   for programs that automatically respond\
    \ to electronic mail in order\n   to reduce the number of problems caused by such\
    \ programs.\n   (Note: the term \"sorcerer's apprentice mode\" is defined as a\
    \ bug in a\n   protocol where, under some circumstances, the receipt of a message\n\
    \   causes multiple messages to be sent, each of which, when received,\n   triggers\
    \ the same bug.) (From [I1.JARGON])\n   This document is limited in scope to Internet\
    \ electronic mail\n   messages and many of its recommendations are specifically\
    \ tailored\n   for the protocol elements and data models used in Internet electronic\n\
    \   mail messages and SMTP transport envelopes.  Use of these\n   recommendations\
    \ in other messaging contexts such as instant\n   messaging, SMS, or Usenet has\
    \ not been considered, and is outside of\n   the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Types of automatic responses
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Types of automatic responses\n   There are several different types of automatic\
    \ responses.  At least\n   two types of automatic responses have been defined\
    \ in IETF standards\n   - Delivery Status Notifications [I2.RFC3464] which are\
    \ intended to\n   report the status of a message delivery by the message transport\n\
    \   system, and Message Disposition Notifications [I3.RFC3798] which are\n   intended\
    \ to report of the disposition of a message after it reaches a\n   recipient's\
    \ mailbox.  These responses are defined elsewhere and are\n   generally not within\
    \ the purview of this document, except that this\n   document recommends specific\
    \ cases where they should or should not be\n   used.\n   Other types of automatic\
    \ response in common use include:\n   -  \"Out of office\" or \"vacation\" notices,\
    \ which are intended to\n      inform the sender of a message that the message\
    \ is unlikely to be\n      read, or acted on, for some amount of time,\n   - \
    \ \"Change of address\" notices, intended to inform the sender of a\n      message\
    \ that the recipient address he used is obsolete and that a\n      different address\
    \ should be used instead (whether or not the\n      subject message was forwarded\
    \ to the current address),\n   -  \"Challenges\", which require the sender of\
    \ a message to demonstrate\n      some measure of intelligence and/or willingness\
    \ to agree to some\n      conditions before the subject message will be delivered\
    \ to the\n      recipient (often to minimize the effect of \"spam\" or viruses\
    \ on\n      the recipient),\n   -  Email-based information services, which accept\
    \ requests\n      (presumably from humans) via email, provide some service, and\n\
    \      issue responses via email also.  (Mailing lists which accept\n      subscription\
    \ requests via email fall into this category),\n   -  Information services similar\
    \ to those mentioned above except that\n      they are intended to accept messages\
    \ from other programs, and\n   -  Various kinds of mail filters (including \"\
    virus scanners\") which\n      act on behalf of a recipient to alter the content\
    \ of messages\n      before forwarding them to that recipient, and issue responses\
    \ in\n      the event a message is altered.\n   Recognizing the wide variety of\
    \ response types in use, these\n   recommendations distinguish between several\
    \ classes of automatic\n   responders according to the party or service on whose\
    \ behalf the\n   responder acts:\n   -  \"Service Responders\" exist to provide\
    \ access to some service via\n      email requests and responses.  These are permanently\
    \ associated\n      with one or more email addresses, and when sending to such\
    \ an\n      address the sender presumably expects an automatic response.  An\n\
    \      email-based file retrieval service is an example of a Service\n      Responder.\
    \  A calendar service that allows appointment requests to\n      be made via email,\
    \ and which responds to such requests, would be\n      another example of a Service\
    \ Responder.\n   -  \"Personal Responders\" exist to make automatic responses\
    \ on behalf\n      of a single recipient address, in addition to, or in lieu of,\
    \ that\n      recipient reading the message.  These responders operate according\n\
    \      to criteria specified on a per-recipient basis.  The UNIX\n      \"vacation\"\
    \ program is an example of a Personal Responder.  A\n      responder that accepts\
    \ mail sent to a single address, attempts to\n      analyze and classify the contents,\
    \ and then issues a response\n      which is dependent on that classification,\
    \ is also a Personal\n      Responder.\n   -  \"Group Responders\" exist to make\
    \ automatic responses on behalf of\n      any of a significant set of recipient\
    \ addresses (say, every\n      recipient in a particular DNS domain), in advance\
    \ of, or in lieu\n      of, a response from the actual recipient.  Group Responders\
    \ are\n      similar to Personal Responders except that in the case of a Group\n\
    \      Responder the criteria for responding are not set on a per-\n      recipient\
    \ basis.  A \"virus scanner\" program that filtered all mail\n      sent to any\
    \ recipient on a particular server, and sent responses\n      when a message was\
    \ rejected or delivered in an altered form, might\n      be an example of a Group\
    \ Responder.\n   Appropriate behavior for a responder varies from one class to\n\
    \   another.  A behavior which might be appropriate from a Service\n   Responder\
    \ (where the sender is expecting an automatic response) might\n   not be appropriate\
    \ from a Personal Responder.  For example, a Service\n   Responder might send\
    \ a very long response to a request, or one that\n   is not in a human-readable\
    \ format, according to the needs of that\n   service.  However a Personal Responder\
    \ should assume that a human\n   being is reading the response and send only brief\
    \ responses in plain\n   text.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Notation and Definitions
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Notation and Definitions\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"SHOULD\"\
    , \"SHOULD NOT\",\n   \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", and \"MAY\" in this\
    \ document are to\n   be interpreted as described in [N1.RFC2119].\n   The term\
    \ \"subject message\" is used to refer to a message which causes\n   a response\
    \ to be sent.\n   The term \"response\" refers to a message that is automatically\
    \ issued\n   on receipt of a subject message by a responder.\n   A \"responder\"\
    \ is a process that automatically responds to subject\n   messages under some\
    \ well-defined set of conditions.\n   Unless specified otherwise, the term \"\
    recipient\" refers to the email\n   addresses to which a subject message was delivered\
    \ (rather than, for\n   instance, the address to which the response was sent).\
    \  A \"recipient\"\n   address might be permanently associated with a responder,\
    \ or it might\n   be the address of a human being whose mail is, under some conditions,\n\
    \   answered by a responder.\n"
- title: 2.  When (not) to send automatic responses
  contents:
  - "2.  When (not) to send automatic responses\n   An automatic responder MUST NOT\
    \ blindly send a response for every\n   message received.  In practice there are\
    \ always reasons to refuse to\n   respond to some kinds of received messages,\
    \ e.g., for loop\n   prevention, to avoid responding to \"spam\" or viruses, to\
    \ avoid being\n   used as a means to launder or amplify abusive messages, to avoid\n\
    \   inappropriately revealing personal information about the recipient\n   (e.g.,\
    \ to avoid an automatic indication that a recipient has not read\n   his mail\
    \ recently), and to thwart denial-of-service attacks against\n   the responder.\
    \  The criteria for deciding whether to respond will\n   differ from one responder\
    \ to another, according to the responder's\n   purpose.  In general, care should\
    \ be taken to avoid sending useless\n   or redundant responses, and to avoid contributing\
    \ to mail loops or\n   facilitating denial-of-service attacks.\n   Here are some\
    \ broad guidelines:\n   -  Automatic responses SHOULD NOT be issued in response\
    \ to any\n      message which contains an Auto-Submitted header field (see below),\n\
    \      where that field has any value other than \"no\".\n   -  Personal and Group\
    \ responses that are intended to notify the\n      sender of a message of the\
    \ recipient's inability to read or reply\n      to the message (e.g., \"away from\
    \ my mail\" or \"too busy\"\n      notifications) SHOULD NOT issue the same response\
    \ to the same\n      sender more than once within a period of several days, even\
    \ though\n      that sender may have sent multiple messages.  A 7-day period is\n\
    \      RECOMMENDED as a default.\n   -  Personal and Group responses whose purpose\
    \ is to notify the sender\n      of a message of a temporary absence of the recipient\
    \ (e.g.,\n      \"vacation\" and \"out of the office\" notices) SHOULD NOT be\
    \ issued\n      unless a valid address for the recipient is explicitly included\
    \ in\n      a recipient (e.g., To, Cc, Bcc, Resent-To, Resent-Cc, or Resent-\n\
    \      Bcc) field of the subject message.  Since a recipient may have\n      multiple\
    \ addresses forwarded to the same mailbox, recipients\n      SHOULD be able to\
    \ specify a set of addresses to the responder\n      which it will recognize as\
    \ valid for that recipient.\n      Note: RFC 2822 section 3.6.3 permits varying\
    \ uses of the Bcc\n      field, some of which would allow the sender of the subject\
    \ message\n      to explicitly specify the recipient's address as a \"Bcc\" recipient\n\
    \      without a Bcc field appearing in the message as delivered, or\n      without\
    \ the Bcc field in the delivered message containing the\n      recipient's address.\
    \  However, perhaps because Bcc's are rarely\n      used, the heuristic of not\
    \ responding to messages for which the\n      recipient was not explicitly listed\
    \ in a To, CC, or Bcc header\n      field has been found to work well in practice.\n\
    \   -  Personal and Group Responders MAY refuse to generate responses\n      except\
    \ to known correspondents or addresses of otherwise \"trusted\"\n      individuals.\
    \  Such responders MAY also generate different kinds of\n      responses for \"\
    trusted\" vs. \"untrusted\" addresses.  This might be\n      useful, for instance,\
    \ to avoid inappropriate disclosure of\n      personal information to arbitrary\
    \ addresses.\n   -  Responders MUST NOT generate any response for which the\n\
    \      destination of that response would be a null address (e.g., an\n      address\
    \ for which SMTP MAIL FROM or Return-Path is <>), since the\n      response would\
    \ not be delivered to a useful destination.\n      Responders MAY refuse to generate\
    \ responses for addresses commonly\n      used as return addresses by responders\
    \ - e.g., those with local-\n      parts matching \"owner-*\", \"*-request\",\
    \ \"MAILER-DAEMON\", etc.\n      Responders are encouraged to check the destination\
    \ address for\n      validity before generating the response, to avoid generating\n\
    \      responses that cannot be delivered or are unlikely to be useful.\n   -\
    \  In order to avoid responding to spam and to certain kinds of\n      attacks,\
    \ automatic responses from Service Responders SHOULD NOT be\n      sent for extremely\
    \ malformed requests.  This may include checking\n      that the subject message\
    \ has a content-type and content\n      appropriate to that service.\n   -  Because\
    \ the vast majority of email is unauthenticated, and return\n      addresses are\
    \ easily forged, in order to avoid being used as a\n      means of denial-of-service\
    \ attacks (i.e., to flood mailboxes with\n      unwanted content) Service Responders\
    \ SHOULD NOT return large\n      responses (say, more than a few kilobytes) without\
    \ specific\n      knowledge that the request was actually authorized by the party\n\
    \      associated with the address to which the response will be sent.\n     \
    \ Similarly, Service Responders SHOULD NOT cause unwanted side-\n      effects\
    \ (such as subscribing the sender to a mailing list) without\n      reasonable\
    \ assurance that the request was authorized by the\n      affected party.\n  \
    \    NOTE: Since each responder has a different purpose and a different\n    \
    \  set of potential threats to which it might be subjected, whether\n      any\
    \ particular means of authentication is appropriate for a\n      particular responder\
    \ is not in scope for this document.\n   -  A responder MAY refuse to send a response\
    \ to a subject message\n      which contains any header or content which makes\
    \ it appear to the\n      responder that a response would not be appropriate.\
    \  For instance,\n      if the subject message contained a Precedence header field\n\
    \      [I4.RFC2076] with a value of \"list\" the responder might guess that\n\
    \      the traffic had arrived from a mailing list, and would not respond\n  \
    \    if the response were only intended for personal messages.  For\n      similar\
    \ reasons, a responder MAY ignore any subject message with a\n      List-* field\
    \ [I5.RFC2369].  (Because Precedence is not a standard\n      header field, and\
    \ its use and interpretation vary widely in the\n      wild, no particular responder\
    \ behavior in the presence of\n      Precedence is recommended by this specification.)\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Format of automatic responses\n   The following sections specify details\
    \ of the contents of automatic\n   responses, including the header of the response\

    \ is\n   transmitted to the email transport system.\n"

- title: 3.1.1.  From field
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  From field\n   In correspondence between humans, the From field serves\
    \ multiple\n   purposes: It identifies the author of the message (or in some cases,\n\
    \   the party or parties on whose behalf the message was sent), and it is\n  \
    \ the default destination of replies from humans.  Unfortunately, some\n   mail\
    \ systems still send non-delivery reports and other kinds of\n   automatic responses\
    \ to the From address.\n   For automatic responses, the role of the From field\
    \ in determining\n   the destination of replies to the response from humans is\
    \ less\n   significant, because in most cases it is not useful or appropriate\n\
    \   for a human (or anyone) to reply to an automatic response.  One\n   exception\
    \ is when there is some problem with the response; it should\n   be possible to\
    \ provide feedback to the person operating the\n   responder.\n   So in most cases\
    \ the From address in an automatic response needs to\n   be chosen according to\
    \ the following criteria:\n   -  To provide an indication of the party or agent\
    \ on whose behalf the\n      response was sent,\n   -  To provide an address to\
    \ which a recipient of an inappropriate\n      response can request that the situation\
    \ be corrected, and\n   -  To diminish the potential for mail loops.\n   The following\
    \ behavior is thus recommended:\n   -  For responses sent by Service Responders,\
    \ the From field SHOULD\n      contain an address which can be used to reach the\
    \ (human)\n      maintainer of that service.  The human-readable portion of the\n\
    \      From field (the display-name preceding the address) SHOULD contain\n  \
    \    a name or description of the service to identify the service to\n      humans.\n\
    \   -  For responses sent by Personal Responders, the From field SHOULD\n    \
    \  contain the name of the recipient of the subject message (i.e.,\n      the\
    \ user on whose behalf the response is being sent) and an\n      address chosen\
    \ by the recipient of the subject message to be\n      recognizable to correspondents.\
    \  Often this will be the same\n      address that was used to send the subject\
    \ message to that\n      recipient.\n      In the case of a recipient having multiple\
    \ mail addresses\n      forwarded to the same mailbox (and responder), a Personal\n\
    \      Responder MAY use heuristics to guess, based on the information\n     \
    \ available in various message header fields, which of several\n      addresses\
    \ for that recipient the sender is likely to have used,\n      and use that address\
    \ in the From field of the response.  However\n      it MUST be possible for a\
    \ recipient on whose behalf the responder\n      is acting to explicitly specify\
    \ the human-readable name and\n      address to be used in the From header fields\
    \ of responses.\n      Note: Due to privacy reasons it may be inappropriate for\n\
    \      responders to disclose an address that is derived, say, from the\n    \
    \  recipient's login information (e.g., POP or IMAP user name or\n      account\
    \ name on a multiuser computer) or which discloses the\n      specific name of\
    \ the computer where the response was generated.\n      Furthermore these do not\
    \ necessarily produce a valid public email\n      address for the recipient. \
    \ For this reason, Personal Responders\n      MUST allow the From field of a Personal\
    \ Response to be set by the\n      recipient on whose behalf the responder is\
    \ acting.\n   -  For Group Responders, the From address SHOULD contain an email\n\
    \      address which could be used to reach the maintainer of that Group\n   \
    \   Responder.  Use of the Postmaster address for this purpose is NOT\n      RECOMMENDED.\n\
    \      The human-readable portion of the From address (the \"phrase\"\n      before\
    \ the address, see [N2.RFC2822], section 3.2.6) SHOULD\n      contain an indication\
    \ of the function performed by the Group\n      Responder and on whose behalf\
    \ it operates (e.g., \"Example Agency\n      virus filter\")\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Reply-To field\n   If a reply is expected by the responder, the Reply-To\
    \ field of the\n   response SHOULD be set to the address at which the reply is\

    \   Responders which request replies to be sent to responders MUST\n   prevent\
    \ mail loops and sorcerer's apprentice mode.  Note that since\n   (according to\
    \ the previous section) the From field of the response\n   SHOULD contain the\
    \ address of a human, if the Reply-To field of the\n   response is used to direct\
    \ replies to a responder it will not be the\n   same as the address in the From\
    \ field.\n   Discussion: this assumes that the human recipient's user agent will\n\
    \   normally send replies to the Reply-To address (if present), as\n   recommended\
    \ by [I6.RFC822] since 1982, but that it is still possible\n   for a recipient\
    \ to reply to the From address if he or she finds it\n   useful to do so.  This\

    \ that the message\n   is an automatic response, followed by contents of the Subject\
    \ field\n   (or a portion thereof) from the subject message.  The prefix \"Auto:\"\
    \n   MAY be used as such an indication.  If used, this prefix SHOULD be\n   followed\
    \ by an ASCII SPACE character (0x20).\n   NOTE: Just as the (Latin-derived) prefix\
    \ \"Re:\" that is commonly used\n   to indicate human-generated responses is sometimes\
    \ translated to\n   other languages by mail user agents, or otherwise interpreted\
    \ by mail\n   user agents as indication that the message is a reply, so the (Greek)\n\
    \   prefix \"Auto:\" may also be translated or used as a generic indication\n\
    \   that the message is an automatic response.  However the \"Auto:\"\n   indication\
    \ is intended only as an aid to humans in processing the\n   message.  Mail processing\
    \ software SHOULD NOT assume that the\n   presence of \"Auto:\" at the beginning\
    \ of a Subject field is an\n   indication that the message was automatically submitted.\n\
    \   Note that the Subject field of the subject message may contain\n   encoded-words\
    \ formatted according to [N3.RFC2047] and [N4.RFC2231],\n   and such text MAY\
    \ be included in the Subject field of a response.  In\n   generating responses\
    \ containing such fields there is rarely a need to\n   decode and re-encode such\
    \ text.  It is usually sufficient to leave\n   those encoded-words as they were\
    \ in the subject message, merely\n   prepending \"Auto: \" or other indication.\
    \  However, it is still\n   necessary to ensure that no line in the resulting\
    \ Subject field that\n   contains an encoded-word is greater than 76 ASCII characters\
    \ in\n   length (this refers to the encoded form, not the number of characters\n\
    \   in the text being encoded).  Also, if the responder truncates the\n   Subject\
    \ from the subject message it is necessary to avoid truncating\n   Subject text\
    \ in the middle of an encoded-word.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.  Message content\n   In general, messages sent by Personal or Group Responders\
    \ SHOULD be\n   brief, and in text/plain format.  A multipart/alternative construct\n\
    \   MAY be used to communicate responses in multiple languages,\n   especially\
    \ if in doing so it is desirable to use multiple charsets.\n   Response messages\
    \ SHOULD NOT include significant content from the\n   subject message.  In particular,\
    \ Personal and Group responses SHOULD\n   NOT contain non-text content from the\
    \ subject message, and they\n   SHOULD NOT include attachments from the subject\
    \ message.  Neither of\n   these conditions applies to responders that specifically\
    \ exist for\n   the purpose of altering or translating content sent to them (for\n\
    \   instance, a FORTRAN-to-C translator); however, such responders MUST\n   employ\
    \ measures to avoid being used as a means of laundering or\n   forwarding undesirable\
    \ content, such as spam or viruses.\n   Note that when text from the Subject or\
    \ other fields from the header\n   of the subject message is included in the body\
    \ of the response, it is\n   necessary to decode any encoded-words that appeared\
    \ in those fields\n   before including in the message body, and to use an appropriate\n\
    \   content-type, charset, and content-transfer-encoding.  In some cases\n   it\
    \ may be necessary to transliterate text from the charset(s) used in\n   the header\
    \ of the subject message, to the charset(s) used in the body\n   of the response.\
    \  (It is much easier to implement a responder if text\n   from the header of\
    \ the subject message never needs to appear in the\n   body of the response.)\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Use of DSNs and MDNs instead of this specification\n   In general, it\
    \ is appropriate to use Delivery Status Notifications\n   (DSNs) for responses\
    \ that are generated by the mail transport system\n   as a result of attempts\
    \ to relay, forward, or deliver mail, and only\n   when the purpose of that response\
    \ is to provide the sender of the\n   subject message with information about the\
    \ status of that mail\n   delivery.  For instance, a \"virus scanner\" which is\
    \ activated by a\n   mail delivery process to filter harmful content prior to\
    \ delivery,\n   could return a DSN with the Action field set to \"failed\" with\
    \ a\n   Status code of 5.7.1 (Delivery not authorized, message refused) if\n \
    \  the entire message was not delivered due to security reasons; or it\n   could\
    \ return a DSN with the Action field set to \"relayed\" or\n   \"delivered\" (as\
    \ appropriate) with a Status code set to 2.6.4\n   (conversion with loss performed)\
    \ if the message was relayed or\n   delivered with the presumably harmful content\
    \ removed.  The DSN\n   specification [I2.RFC3464], rather than this document,\
    \ governs the\n   generation and format of DSNs.\n   Similarly, it is appropriate\
    \ to use Message Disposition Notifications\n   (MDNs) only for responses generated\
    \ on the recipient's behalf, which\n   are generated on or after delivery to a\
    \ recipient's mailbox, and for\n   which the purpose of the response is to indicate\
    \ the disposition of\n   the message.  The MDN specification [I3.RFC3798], rather\
    \ than this\n   document, governs the generation and format of MDNs.\n   This\
    \ document is not intended to alter either the DSN or MDN\n   specifications.\
    \  Responses that fit within the criteria of DSN or\n   MDN, as defined by the\
    \ respective specifications, should be generated\n   according to the DSN or MDN\

- title: 4.  Where to send automatic responses (and where not to send them)
  contents:
  - "4.  Where to send automatic responses (and where not to send them)\n   In general,\
    \ automatic responses SHOULD be sent to the Return-Path\n   field if generated\
    \ after delivery.  If the response is generated\n   prior to delivery, the response\
    \ SHOULD be sent to the reverse-path\n   from the SMTP MAIL FROM command, or (in\
    \ a non-SMTP system) to the\n   envelope return address which serves as the destination\
    \ for non-\n   delivery reports.\n   If the response is to be generated after\
    \ delivery, and there is no\n   Return-Path field in the subject message, there\
    \ is an implementation\n   or configuration error in the SMTP server that delivered\
    \ the message\n   or gatewayed the message outside of SMTP.  A Personal or Group\n\
    \   responder SHOULD NOT deliver a response to any address other than\n   that\
    \ in the Return-Path field, even if the Return-Path field is\n   missing.  It\
    \ is better to fix the problem with the mail delivery\n   system than to rely\
    \ on heuristics to guess the appropriate\n   destination of the response.  Such\
    \ heuristics have been known to\n   cause problems in the past.\n   A Service\
    \ Responder MAY deliver the response to the address(es) from\n   the >From field,\
    \ or to another address from the request payload,\n   provided this behavior is\
    \ precisely defined in the specification for\n   that service.  Services responders\
    \ SHOULD NOT use the Reply-To field\n   for this purpose.\n   The Reply-To field\
    \ SHOULD NOT be used as the destination for\n   automatic responses from Personal\
    \ or Group Responders.  In general,\n   this field is set by a human sender based\
    \ on his/her anticipation of\n   how human recipients will respond to the specific\
    \ content of that\n   message.  For instance, a human sender may use Reply-To\
    \ to request\n   that replies be sent to an entire mailing list.  Even for replies\n\
    \   from humans, there are cases where it is not appropriate to respond\n   to\
    \ the Reply-To address, especially if the sender has asked that\n   replies be\
    \ sent to a group and/or mailing list.  Since a Personal or\n   Group Responder\
    \ operates on behalf of a human recipient, it is safer\n   to assume that any\
    \ Reply-To field present in the message was set by a\n   human sender on the assumption\
    \ that any reply would come from a human\n   who had some understanding of the\
    \ roles of the sender and other\n   recipients.  An automatic responder lacks\
    \ the information necessary\n   to understand those roles.  Sending automatic\
    \ responses to Reply-To\n   addresses can thus result in a large number of people\
    \ receiving a\n   useless or unwanted message; it can also contribute to mail\
    \ loops.\n   Use of the From field as the destination for automatic responses\
    \ has\n   some of the same problems as use of Reply-To.  In particular, the\n\
    \   From field may list multiple addresses, while automatic responses\n   should\
    \ only be sent to a single address.  In general, the From and\n   Reply-To addresses\
    \ are used in a variety of ways according to\n   differing circumstances, and\
    \ for this reason Personal or Group\n   Responders cannot reliably assume that\
    \ an address in the From or\n   Reply-To field is an appropriate destination for\
    \ the response.  For\n   these reasons the From field SHOULD NOT be used as a\
    \ destination for\n   automatic responses.\n   Similarly, the Sender field SHOULD\
    \ NOT be used as the destination for\n   automatic responses.  This field is intended\
    \ only to identify the\n   person or entity that sent the message, and is not\
    \ required to\n   contain an address that is valid for replies.\n   The Return-Path\
    \ address is really the only one from the message\n   header that can be expected,\
    \ as a matter of protocol, to be suitable\n   for automatic responses that were\
    \ not anticipated by the sender.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Automatic responders introduce the potential\

    \ for the purpose of wider distribution\n      of the content or masking the source\
    \ of such content;\n   -  Use of such responders to mount denial-of-service attacks\
    \ by using\n      responders to relay messages to large numbers of addresses,\
    \ or to\n      flood individual mailboxes with a large amount of unwanted\n  \
    \    content, or both;\n   -  Deliberate or accidental use of such responders\
    \ to construct mail\n      loops or \"sorcerer's apprentice mode\", thus taxing\
    \ the resources\n      of the mail transport system;\n   -  Use of such responders\
    \ to determine whether recipient addresses\n      are valid, especially when such\
    \ information is not otherwise\n      provided (e.g., SMTP RCPT or VRFY command\

    \ about recipients' recent usage\n      of his mailbox or recent activity;\n \
    \  -  In addition, the responder itself may be subject to attack by\n      sending\
    \ it large numbers of requests.\n   This document attempts to reduce the vulnerability\
    \ of responders to\n   such attack, in particular by\n   -  Recommending that\
    \ responders not relay significant content from\n      the subject message (thus\
    \ minimizing the potential for use of\n      responders to launder or amplify\
    \ attacker-chosen content)\n   -  Recommending that responders clearly mark responses\
    \ with the\n      \"Auto-Submitted: auto-replied\" header field to distinguish\
    \ them\n      from messages originated by humans (in part, to minimize the\n \
    \     potential for loops and denial-of-service attacks),\n   -  Recommending\
    \ that Personal and Group Responders limit the number\n      of responses sent\
    \ to any individual per period of time (also\n      limiting the potential damage\
    \ caused by loops),\n   -  Recommending that responders respond to at most one\
    \ address per\n      incoming message (to minimize the potential for deliberate\
    \ or\n      accidental denial-of-service via \"multiplication\" or sorcerer's\n\
    \      apprentice mode),\n   -  Recommending that responses from Personal and\
    \ Group Responders\n      should be brief and in plain text format (to minimize\
    \ the\n      potential for mail responders to be used as mechanisms for\n    \
    \  transmitting harmful content and/or disguising the source of\n      harmful\
    \ content).\n   However, because email addresses are easily forged, attacks are\
    \ still\n   possible for any email responder which does not limit access and\n\
    \   require authentication before issuing a response.  The above measures\n  \
    \ attempt to limit the damage which can be done, but they cannot\n   entirely\
    \ prevent attacks.\n   This section describes vulnerabilities inherent in automatically\n\
    \   responding to mail.  Other vulnerabilities are associated with some\n   mail-based\
    \ services which automatically respond to email messages,\n   but these are not\
    \ caused by the fact that the server automatically\n   responds to incoming messages.\
    \  In general, any network-based service\n   (including those accessed by email)\
    \ needs to provide security that is\n   sufficient to prevent the service from\
    \ being used as a means to\n   inappropriately or destructively access the resources\
    \ that are\n   accessible by the service.\n   It has also been noted that Personal\
    \ and Group Responders sometimes\n   inappropriately disclose recipients' personal\
    \ information.  This\n   might happen automatically (as when a Group Responder\
    \ automatically\n   supplies a recipient's personal or mobile telephone number\

    \ information SHOULD NOT include personal information about\n   the recipient\
    \ which is not already known to, or easily available to,\n   the sender of the\
    \ subject message.  User interfaces which allow\n   recipients to supply response\

    \ intended as\n   illustration only and is not a normative part of this standard.\n\
    \   The vacation program is a Personal Responder.\n   The vacation program refuses\
    \ to respond to any message which:\n   -  appears to be spam (for instance, if\
    \ it has been labelled as\n      advertising by the sender or as potential spam\
    \ by some\n      intermediary),\n   -  appears to contain a virus (for instance,\

    \ address of a\n      form that is frequently used by non-delivery reports.\n\
    \   The format of the vacation response is as follows:\n   -  The From header\
    \ field is set to a name and email address specified\n      by the user on whose\
    \ behalf the responses are being sent.  (On\n      some systems it may be reasonable\
    \ to have a default setting for\n      the From field of vacation responses that\

    \   -  The Reply-To field is set only if explicitly configured by the\n      user\
    \ on whose behalf the responses are being sent.  For example, a\n      user might\
    \ direct replies to a secretary or co-worker who has been\n      delegated to\

    \ contains Auto: followed by a string chosen by\n      the user on whose behalf\
    \ the responses are being sent.  A default\n      setting of something like \"\
    away from my mail\" might be\n      appropriate.  If the Subject field contains\

    \   -  The Auto-Submitted field has the value \"auto-replied\".\n   -  The message\
    \ body contains some text specified by the user on whose\n      behalf the response\
    \ is being sent.  A brief summary of the subject\n      message is also included,\

    \ series of\n   internet-drafts on \"Behavior of Mail Based Servers\", and in\n\
    \   particular, one document on \"Answering Servers\".  While these\n   documents\
    \ were (to this author's knowledge) never formally published,\n   they provided\
    \ the first well-reasoned argument (known to this author)\n   as to the best way\
    \ for such servers to interface with email systems\n   and protocols.\n   The\
    \ idea for the Auto-Submitted field comes from the X.400/MHS mail\n   system [I7.X420].\
    \  [I8.RFC2156] defined an \"Autosubmitted\" field for\n   use when gatewaying\
    \ between X.400 and Internet mail.  Jacob Palme\n   wrote an internet-draft defining\
    \ use of the \"Auto-Submitted\" field\n   for Internet mail, which made it through\
    \ Last Call without\n   significant objections, but got stalled in an attempt\
