- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document presents a framework for supporting Emergency\n\
    \   Telecommunications Services (ETS) within the scope of a single\n   administrative\
    \ domain.  This narrow scope provides a reference point\n   for considering protocols\
    \ that could be deployed to support ETS.\n   [rfc4375] is a complementary effort\
    \ that articulates requirements for\n   a single administrative domain and defines\
    \ it as \"collection of\n   resources under the control of a single administrative\
    \ authority\".\n   We use this other effort as both a starting point and guide\
    \ for this\n   document.\n   A different example of a framework document for ETS\
    \ is [rfc4190],\n   which focused on support for ETS within IP telephony.  In\
    \ this case,\n   the focal point was a particular application whose flows could\
    \ span\n   multiple autonomous domains.  Even though this document uses a\n  \
    \ somewhat more constrained perspective than [rfc4190], we can still\n   expect\
    \ some measure of overlap in the areas that are discussed.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Differences between Single and Inter-Domain
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Differences between Single and Inter-Domain\n   The progression of our\
    \ work in the following sections is helped by\n   stating some key differences\
    \ between the single and inter-domain\n   cases.  From a general perspective,\
    \ one can start by observing the\n   following.\n      a) Congruent with physical\
    \ topology of resources, each domain is\n         an authority zone, and there\
    \ is currently no scalable way to\n         transfer authority between zones.\n\
    \      b) Each authority zone is under separate management.\n      c) Authority\
    \ zones are run by competitors; this acts as further\n         deterrent to transferring\
    \ authority.\n   As a result of the initial statements in (a) through (c) above,\n\
    \   additional observations can be made that distinguish the single and\n   inter-domain\
    \ cases, as follows.\n      d) Different policies might be implemented in different\n\
    \         administrative domains.\n      e) There is an absence of any practical\
    \ method for ingress nodes\n         of a transit domain to authenticate all of\
    \ the IP network layer\n         packets that have labels indicating a preference\
    \ or importance.\n      f) Given item (d) above, all current inter-domain QoS\
    \ mechanisms\n         at the network level generally create easily exploited\
    \ and\n         significantly painful Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed\n\
    \         Denial of Service (DDoS) attack vectors on the network.\n      g) A\
    \ single administrative domain can deploy various mechanisms\n         (e.g.,\
    \ access control lists) into each and every edge device\n         (e.g., ethernet\
    \ switch or router) to ensure that only\n         authorized end-users (or layer\
    \ 2 interfaces) are able to emit\n         frames/packets with non-default QoS\
    \ labels into the network.\n         This is not feasible in the inter-domain\
    \ case because the\n         inter-domain link contains aggregated flows.  In\
    \ addition, the\n         dissemination of access control lists at the network\
    \ level is\n         not scalable in the inter-domain case.\n      h) A single\
    \ domain can deploy mechanisms into the edge devices to\n         enforce its\
    \ domain-wide policies -- without having to trust any\n         third party to\
    \ configure things correctly.  This is not\n         possible in the inter-domain\
    \ case.\n   While the above is not an all-inclusive set of differences, it does\n\
    \   provide some rationale why one may wish to focus efforts in the more\n   constrained\
    \ scenario of a single administrative domain.\n"
- title: '2.  Common Practice: Provisioning'
  contents:
  - "2.  Common Practice: Provisioning\n   The IEPREP working group and mailing list\
    \ have had extensive\n   discussions about over-provisioning.  Many of these exchanges\
    \ have\n   debated the need for QoS mechanisms versus over-provisioning of\n \
    \  links.\n   In reality, most IP network links are provisioned with a percentage\n\
    \   of excess capacity beyond that of the average load.  The 'shared'\n   resource\
    \ model together with TCP's congestion avoidance algorithms\n   helps compensate\
    \ for those cases where spikes or bursts of traffic\n   are experienced by the\
    \ network.\n   The thrust of the debate within the IEPREP working group is whether\n\
    \   it is always better to over-provision links to such a degree that\n   spikes\
    \ in load can still be supported with no loss due to congestion.\n   Advocates\
    \ of this position point to many ISPs in the US that take\n   this approach instead\
    \ of using QoS mechanisms to honor agreements\n   with their peers or customers.\
    \  These advocates point to cost\n   effectiveness in comparison to complexity\
    \ and security issues\n   associated with other approaches.\n   Proponents of\
    \ QoS mechanisms argue that the relatively low cost of\n   bandwidth enjoyed in\
    \ the US (particularly, by large ISPs) is not\n   necessarily available throughout\
    \ the world.  Beyond the subject of\n   cost, some domains are comprised of physical\
    \ networks that support\n   wide disparity in bandwidth capacity -- e.g., attachment\
    \ points\n   connected to high capacity fiber and lower capacity wireless links.\n\
    \   This document does not advocate one of these positions over the\n   other.\
    \  The author does advocate that network\n   administrators/operators should perform\
    \ a cost analysis between\n   over-provisioning for spikes versus QoS mechanisms\
    \ as applied within\n   a domain and its access link to another domain (e.g.,\
    \ a customer and\n   its ISP).  This analysis, in addition to examining policies\
    \ and\n   requirements of the administrative domain, should be the key to\n  \
    \ deciding how (or if) ETS should be supported within the domain.\n   If the decision\
    \ is to rely on over-provisioning, then some of the\n   following sections will\
    \ have little to no bearing on how ETS is\n   supported within a domain.  The\
    \ exception would be labeling\n   mechanisms used to convey information to other\
    \ communication\n   architectures (e.g., SIP-to-SS7/ISUP gateways).\n"
- title: 3.  Objective
  contents:
  - "3.  Objective\n   The primary objective is to provide a target measure of service\n\
    \   within a domain for flows that have been labeled for ETS.  This level\n  \
    \ may be better than best effort, the best available service that the\n   network\
    \ (or parts thereof) can offer, or a specific percentage of\n   resource set aside\
    \ for ETS.  [rfc4375] presents a set of requirements\n   in trying to achieve\
    \ this objective.\n   This framework document uses [rfc4375] as a reference point\
    \ in\n   discussing existing areas of engineering work or protocols that can\n\
    \   play a role in supporting ETS within a domain.  Discussion of these\n   areas\
    \ and protocols are not to be confused with expectations that\n   they exist within\
    \ a given domain.  Rather, the subjects discussed in\n   Section 4 below are ones\
    \ that are recognized as candidates that can\n   exist and could be used to facilitate\
    \ ETS users or data flows.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Scenarios
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Scenarios\n   One of the topics of discussion on the IEPREP mailing list\
    \ and in the\n   working group meetings is the operating environment of the ETS\
    \ user.\n   Many variations can be dreamed of with respect to underlying network\n\
    \   technologies and applications.  Instead of getting lost in hundreds\n   of\
    \ potential scenarios, we attempt to abstract the scenarios into two\n   simple\
    \ case examples.\n      (a) A user in their home network attempts to use or leverage\
    \ any\n          ETS capability within the domain.\n      (b) A user visits a\
    \ foreign network and attempts to use or\n          leverage any ETS capability\
    \ within the domain.\n   We borrow the terms \"home\" and \"foreign\" network\
    \ from that used in\n   Mobile IP [rfc3344].  Case (a) is considered the normal\
    \ and vastly\n   most prevalent scenario in today's Internet.  Case (b) above\
    \ may\n   simply be supported by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)\n\
    \   [rfc2131], or a static set of addresses, that are assigned to\n   'visitors'\
    \ of the network.  This effort is predominantly operational\n   in nature and\
    \ heavily reliant on the management and security policies\n   of that network.\n\
    \   A more ambitious way of supporting the mobile user is through the use\n  \
    \ of the Mobile IP (MIP) protocol.  MIP offers a measure of\n   application-transparent\
    \ mobility as a mobile host moves from one\n   subnetwork to another while keeping\
    \ the same stable IP address\n   registered at a global anchor point.  However,\
    \ this feature may not\n   always be available or in use.  In any case, where\
    \ it is in use, at\n   least some of the packets destined to and from the mobile\
    \ host go\n   through the home network.\n"
- title: 4.  Topic Areas
  contents:
  - "4.  Topic Areas\n   The topic areas presented below are not presented in any\
    \ particular\n   order or along any specific layering model.  They represent\n\
    \   capabilities that may be found within an administrative domain.  Many\n  \
    \ are topics of on-going work within the IETF.\n   It must be stressed that readers\
    \ of this document should not expect\n   any of the following to exist within\
    \ a domain for ETS users.  In many\n   cases, while some of the following areas\
    \ have been standardized and\n   in wide use for several years, others have seen\
    \ very limited\n   deployment.\n"
- title: 4.1.  MPLS
  contents:
  - "4.1.  MPLS\n   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is generally the first protocol\n\
    \   that comes to mind when the subject of traffic engineering is brought\n  \
    \ up.  MPLS signaling produces Labeled Switched Paths (LSPs) through a\n   network\
    \ of Label Switch Routers [rfc3031].  When traffic reaches the\n   ingress boundary\
    \ of an MPLS domain (which may or may not be congruent\n   with an administrative\
    \ domain), the packets are classified, labeled,\n   scheduled, and forwarded along\
    \ an LSP.\n   [rfc3270] describes how MPLS can be used to support Differentiated\n\
    \   Services.  The RFC discusses the use of the 3-bit EXP (experimental)\n   field\
    \ to convey the Per Hop Behavior (PHB) to be applied to the\n   packet.  As we\
    \ shall see in later sections, this 3-bit field can be\n   mapped to fields in\
    \ several other protocols.\n   The inherent features of classification, scheduling,\
    \ and labeling are\n   viewed as symbiotic, and therefore, they are often integrated\
    \ with\n   other protocols and architectures.  Examples of this include RSVP and\n\
    \   Differentiated Services.  Below, we discuss several instances where a\n  \
    \ given protocol specification or mechanism has been known to be\n   complemented\
    \ with MPLS.  This includes the potential labels that may\n   be associated with\
    \ ETS.  However, we stress that MPLS is only one of\n   several approaches to\
    \ support traffic engineering.  In addition, the\n   complexity of the MPLS protocol\
    \ and architecture may make it suited\n   only for large domains.\n"
- title: 4.2.  RSVP
  contents:
  - "4.2.  RSVP\n   The original design of RSVP, together with the Integrated Services\n\
    \   model, was one of an end-to-end signaling capability to set up a path\n  \
    \ of reserved resources that spanned networks and administrative\n   domains [rfc2205].\
    \  Currently, RSVP has not been widely deployed by\n   network administrators\
    \ for QoS across domains.  Today's limited\n   deployment by network administrators\
    \ has been mostly constrained to\n   boundaries within a domain, and commonly\
    \ in conjunction with MPLS\n   signaling.  Early deployments of RSVP ran into\
    \ unanticipated scaling\n   issues; it is not entirely clear how scalable an RSVP\
    \ approach would\n   be across the Internet.\n   [rfc3209] is one example of how\
    \ RSVP has evolved to complement\n   efforts that are scoped to operate within\
    \ a domain.  In this case,\n   extensions to RSVP are defined that allow it to\
    \ establish intra-\n   domain Labeled Switched Paths (LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label\
    \ Switching\n   (MPLS).\n   [rfc2750] specifies extensions to RSVP so that it\
    \ can support generic\n   policy-based admission control.  This standard goes\
    \ beyond the\n   support of the POLICY_DATA object stipulated in [rfc3209], by\n\
    \   defining the means of control and enforcement of access and usage\n   policies.\
    \  While the standard does not advocate a particular policy\n   architecture,\
    \ the IETF has defined one that can complement [rfc2750]\n   -- we expand on this\
    \ in Section 4.3 below.\n"
- title: 4.2.1.  Relation to ETS
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  Relation to ETS\n   The ability to reserve resources correlates to an\
    \ ability to provide\n   preferential service for specifically classified traffic\
    \ -- the\n   classification being a tuple of 1 or more fields which may or may\
    \ not\n   include an ETS specific label.  In cases where a tuple includes a\n\
    \   label that has been defined for ETS usage, the reservation helps\n   ensure\
    \ that an emergency-related flow will be forwarded towards its\n   destination.\
    \  Within the scope of this document, this means that RSVP\n   would be used to\
    \ facilitate the forwarding of traffic within a\n   domain.\n   We note that this\
    \ places an importance on defining a label and an\n   associated field that can\
    \ be set and/or examined by RSVP-capable\n   nodes.\n   Another important observation\
    \ is that major vendor routers currently\n   constrain their examination of fields\
    \ for classification to the\n   network and transport layers.  This means that\
    \ application layer\n   labels will mostly likely be ignored by routers/switches.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Policy
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Policy\n   The Common Open Policy Service (COPS) protocol [rfc2748] was\
    \ defined\n   to provide policy control over QoS signaling protocols, such as\
    \ RSVP.\n   COPS is based on a query/response model in which Policy Enforcement\n\
    \   Points (PEPs) interact with Policy Decision Points (i.e., policy\n   servers)\
    \ to exchange policy information.  COPS provides application-\n   level security\
    \ and can operate over IPsec or TLS.  COPS is also a\n   stateful protocol that\
    \ supports a push model.  This means that\n   servers can download new policies\
    \ or alter existing ones to known\n   clients.\n   [rfc2749] articulates the usage\
    \ of COPS with RSVP.  It specifies COPS\n   client types, context objects, and\
    \ decision objects.  Thus, when an\n   RSVP reservation is received by a PEP,\
    \ the PEP decides whether to\n   accept or reject it based on policy.  This policy\
    \ information can be\n   stored a priori to the reception of the RSVP PATH message,\
    \ or it can\n   be retrieved on an on-demand basis.  A similar course of action\
    \ could\n   be applied in cases where ETS-labeled control flows are received by\n\
    \   the PEP.  This of course would require an associated (and new) set of\n  \
    \ documents that first articulates types of ETS signaling and then\n   specifies\
    \ its usage with COPS.\n   A complementary document to the COPS protocols is COPS\
    \ Usage for\n   Policy Provisioning (COPS-PR) [rfc3084].\n   As a side note, the\
    \ current lack of deployment by network\n   administrators of RSVP has also played\
    \ at least an indirect role in\n   the subsequent lack of implementation and deployment\
    \ of COPS-PR.\n   [rfc3535] is an output from the IAB Network Management Workshop\
    \ in\n   which the topic of COPS and its current state of deployment was\n   discussed.\
    \  At the time of that workshop in 2002, COPS-PR was\n   considered a technology/architecture\
    \ that did not fully meet the\n   needs of network operators.  It should also\
    \ be noted that at the 60th\n   IETF meeting held in San Diego in 2004, COPS was\
    \ discussed as a\n   candidate protocol that should be declared as historic because\
    \ of\n   lack of use and concerns about its design.  In the future, an altered\n\
    \   design of COPS may emerge that addresses the concern of operators,\n   but\
    \ speculation on that or other possibilities is beyond the scope of\n   this document.\n"

- title: 4.4.1.  IEEE 802.1 VLANs
  contents:
  - "4.4.1.  IEEE 802.1 VLANs\n   The IEEE 802.1q standard defined a tag appended\
    \ to a Media Access\n   Controller (MAC) frame for support of layer 2 Virtual\
    \ Local Area\n   Networks (VLANs).  This tag has two parts: a VLAN identifier\
    \ (12\n   bits) and a Prioritization field of 3 bits.  A subsequent standard,\n\
    \   IEEE 802.1p, later incorporated into a revision of IEEE 802.1d,\n   defined\
    \ the Prioritization field of this new tag [iso15802].  It\n   consists of 8 levels\
    \ of priority, with the highest priority being a\n   value of 7.  Vendors may\
    \ choose a queue per priority codepoint, or\n   aggregate several codepoints to\
    \ a single queue.\n   The 3-bit Prioritization field can be easily mapped to the\
    \ old ToS\n   field of the upper-layer IP header.  In turn, these bits can also\
    \ be\n   mapped to a subset of differentiated codepoints.  Bits in the IP\n  \
    \ header that could be used to support ETS (e.g., specific Diffserv\n   codepoints)\
    \ can in turn be mapped to the Prioritization bits of\n   802.1p.  This mapping\
    \ could be accomplished in a one-to-one manner\n   between the 802.1p field and\
    \ the IP ToS bits, or in an aggregate\n   manner if one considers the entire Diffserv\
    \ field in the IP header.\n   In either case, because of the scarcity of bits,\
    \ ETS users should\n   expect that their traffic will be combined or aggregated\
    \ with the\n   same level of priority as some other types of \"important\" traffic.\n\
    \   In other words, given the existing 3-bit Priority Field for 802.1p,\n   there\
    \ will not be an exclusive bit value reserved for ETS traffic.\n   Certain vendors\
    \ are currently providing mappings between the 802.1p\n   field and the ToS bits.\
    \  This is in addition to integrating the\n   signaling of RSVP with the low-level\
    \ inband signaling offered in the\n   Priority field of 802.1p.\n   It is important\
    \ to note that the 802.1p standard does not specify the\n   correlation of a layer\
    \ 2 codepoint to a physical network bandwidth\n   reservation.  Instead, this\
    \ standard provides what has been termed as\n   \"best effort QoS\".  The value\
    \ of the 802.1p Priority codepoints is\n   realized at the edges: either as the\
    \ MAC payload is passed to upper\n   layers (like IP), or as it is bridged to\
    \ other physical networks like\n   Frame Relay.  Either of these actions help\
    \ provide an intra-domain\n   wide propagation of a labeled flow for both layer\
    \ 2 and layer 3\n   flows.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.4.2.  IEEE 802.11e QoS\n   The 802.11e standard is a proposed enhancement that\
    \ specifies\n   mechanisms to provide QoS to the 802.11 family of protocols for\n\
    \   wireless LANs.\n   Previously, 802.11 had two modes of operation.  One was\
    \ Distributed\n   Coordination Function (DCF) , which is based on the classic\
    \ collision\n   detection schema of \"listen before sending\".  A second optional\
    \ mode\n   is the Point Coordination Function (PCF).  The modes splits access\n\
    \   time into contention-free and contention-active periods --\n   transmitting\
    \ data during the former.\n   The 802.11e standard enhances DCF by adding support\
    \ for 8 different\n   traffic categories or classifications.  Each higher category\
    \ waits a\n   little less time than the next lower one before it sends its data.\n\
    \   In the case of PCF, a Hybrid Coordination Function has been added\n   that\
    \ polls stations during contention-free time slots and grants them\n   a specific\
    \ start time and maximum duration for transmission.  This\n   second mode is more\
    \ complex than enhanced DCF, but the QoS can be\n   more finely tuned to offer\

    \ 27 M downstream, and anywhere from 320 kb to 10 M upstream\n   (i.e., in the\
    \ direction of the user towards the Internet).\n   The evolution of the DOCSIS\
    \ specification, from 1.0 to 1.1, brought\n   about changes to support a service\
    \ other than best effort.  One of\n   the changes was indirectly added when the\
    \ 802.1d protocol added the\n   Priority field, which was incorporated within\
    \ the DOCSIS 1.1\n   specification.  Another change was the ability to perform\
    \ packet\n   fragmentation of large packets so that Priority-marked packets (i.e.,\n\
    \   packets marked with non-best effort labels) can be multiplexed in\n   between\
    \ the fragmented larger packet.\n   It's important to note that the DOCSIS specifications\
    \ do not specify\n   how vendors implement classification, policing, and scheduling\
    \ of\n   traffic.  Hence, operators must rely on mechanisms in Cable Modem\n \
    \  Termination Systems (CMTS) and edge routers to leverage indirectly or\n   directly\
    \ the added specifications of DOCSIS 1.1.  As in the case of\n   802.1p, ETS-labeled\
    \ traffic would most likely be aggregated with\n   other types of traffic, which\
    \ implies that an exclusive bit (or set\n   of bits) will not be reserved for\
    \ ETS users.  Policies and other\n   managed configurations will determine the\
    \ form of the service\n   experienced by ETS labeled traffic.\n   Traffic engineering\
    \ and management of ETS labeled flows, including\n   its classification and scheduling\
    \ at the edges of the DOCSIS cloud,\n   could be accomplished in several ways.\
    \  A simple schema could be\n   based on non-FIFO queuing mechanisms like class-based\
    \ weighted fair\n   queuing (or combinations and derivations thereof).  The addition\
    \ of\n   active queue management like Random Early Detection could provide\n \
    \  simple mechanisms for dealing with bursty traffic contributing to\n   congestion.\
    \  A more elaborate scheme for traffic engineering would\n   include the use of\
    \ MPLS.  However, the complexity of MPLS should be\n   taken into consideration\
    \ before its deployment in networks.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Multicast
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Multicast\n   Network layer multicast has existed for quite a few years.\
    \  Efforts\n   such as the Mbone (multicast backbone) have provided a form of\n\
    \   tunneled multicast that spans domains, but the routing hierarchy of\n   the\
    \ Mbone can be considered flat and non-congruent with unicast\n   routing.  Efforts\
    \ like the Multicast Source Discovery Protocol\n   [rfc3618] together with the\
    \ Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse\n   Mode (PIM-SM) have been used by\
    \ a small subset of Internet Service\n   Providers to provide forms of inter-domain\
    \ multicast [rfc4601].\n   However, network layer multicast has not been accepted\
    \ as a common\n   production level service by a vast majority of ISPs.\n   In\
    \ contrast, intra-domain multicast in domains has gained more\n   acceptance as\
    \ an additional network service.  Multicast can produce\n   denial-of-service\
    \ attacks using the any sender model, with the\n   problem made more acute with\
    \ flood and prune algorithms.  Source-\n   specific multicast [rfc3569], together\
    \ with access control lists of\n   who is allowed to be a sender, reduces the\
    \ potential and scope of\n   such attacks.\n"
- title: 4.5.1.  IP Layer
  contents:
  - "4.5.1.  IP Layer\n   The value of IP multicast is its efficient use of resources\
    \ in\n   sending the same datagram to multiple receivers.  An extensive\n   discussion\
    \ on the strengths of and concerns about multicast is\n   outside the scope of\
    \ this document.  However, one can argue that\n   multicast can very naturally\
    \ complement the push-to-talk feature of\n   land mobile radio (LMR) networks.\n\
    \   Push-to-talk is a form of group communication where every user in the\n  \
    \ \"talk group\" can participate in the same conversation.  LMR is the\n   type\
    \ of network used by First Responders (e.g., police, firemen, and\n   medical\
    \ personnel) that are involved in emergencies.  Currently,\n   certain vendors\
    \ and providers are offering push-to-talk service to\n   the general public in\
    \ addition to First Responders.  Some of these\n   systems are operated over IP\
    \ networks or are interfaced with IP\n   networks to extend the set of users that\
    \ can communicate with each\n   other.  We can consider at least a subset of these\
    \ systems as either\n   closed IP networks, or domains, since they do not act\
    \ as transits to\n   other parts of the Internet.\n   The potential integration\
    \ of LMR talk groups with IP multicast is an\n   open issue.  LMR talk groups\
    \ are established in a static manner with\n   man-in-the-loop participation in\
    \ their establishment and teardown.\n   The seamless integration of these talk\
    \ groups with multicast group\n   addresses is a feature that has not been discussed\
    \ in open forums.\n"
- title: 4.5.2.  IEEE 802.1d MAC Bridges
  contents:
  - "4.5.2.  IEEE 802.1d MAC Bridges\n   The IEEE 802.1d standard specifies fields\
    \ and capabilities for a\n   number of features.  In Section 4.3.2 above, we discussed\
    \ its use for\n   defining a Prioritization field.  The 802.1d standard also covers\
    \ the\n   topic of filtering MAC layer multicast frames.\n   One of the concerns\
    \ about multicast is that broadcast storms can\n   arise and generate a denial\

    \ out multicast frames in cases\n   where the subnetwork resource is relatively\
    \ small (e.g., 802.11\n   networks).  Operational considerations with respect\
    \ to ETS may wish\n   to consider doing this on an as-needed basis, balancing\
    \ the\n   conditions of the network with the perceived need for multicast.  In\n\

- title: 4.6.  Discovery
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Discovery\n   If a service is being offered to explicitly support ETS,\
    \ then it\n   would seem reasonable that discovery of the service may be of\n\
    \   benefit.  For example, if a domain has a subset of servers that\n   recognize\
    \ ETS-labeled traffic, then dynamic discovery of where these\n   servers are (or\
    \ even if they exist) would be more beneficial than\n   relying on statically\
    \ configured information.\n   The Service Location Protocol (SLP) [rfc2608] is\
    \ designed to provide\n   information about the existence, location, and configuration\
    \ of\n   networked services.  In many cases, the name of the host supporting\n\
    \   the desired service is needed to be known a priori in order for users\n  \
    \ to access it.  SLP eliminates this requirement by using a descriptive\n   model\
    \ that identifies the service.  Based on this description, SLP\n   then resolves\
    \ the network address of the service and returns this\n   information to the requester.\
    \  An interesting design element of SLP\n   is that it assumes that the protocol\
    \ is run over a collection of\n   nodes that are under the control of a single\
    \ administrative\n   authority.  This model follows the scope of this framework\
    \ document.\n   However, the scope of SLP may be better suited for parts of an\n\
    \   enterprise network versus an entire domain.\n   Anycasting [rfc1546] is another\
    \ means of discovering nodes that\n   support a given service.  Interdomain anycast\
    \ addresses, propagated\n   by BGP, represent anycast in a wide scope and have\
    \ been used by\n   multiple root servers for a while.  Anycast can also be realized\
    \ in a\n   more constrained and limited scope (i.e., solely within a domain or\n\
    \   subnet), and as in the case of multicast, it may not be supported.\n   [rfc4291]\
    \ covers the topic of anycast addresses for IPv6.  Unlike\n   SLP, users/applications\
    \ must know the anycast address associated with\n   the target service.  In addition,\
    \ responses to multiple requests to\n   the anycast address may come from different\
    \ servers.  Lack of\n   response (not due to connectivity problems) correlates\
    \ to the\n   discovery that a target service is not available.  Detailed tradeoffs\n\
    \   between this approach and SLP are outside the scope of this framework\n  \
    \ document.\n   The Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) is used to implement\
    \ a\n   binding of strings to data in order to support dynamically configured\n\
    \   delegation systems [rfc3401].  The DDDS functions by mapping some\n   unique\
    \ string to data stored within a DDDS Database by iteratively\n   applying string\
    \ transformation rules until a terminal condition is\n   reached.  The potential\
    \ then exists that a client could specify a set\n   of known tags (e.g., RetrieveMail:Pop3)\
    \ that would identify/discover\n   the appropriate server with which it can communicate.\n"
- title: 4.7.  Differentiated Services (Diffserv)
  contents:
  - "4.7.  Differentiated Services (Diffserv)\n   There are a number of examples where\
    \ Diffserv [rfc2474] has been\n   deployed strictly within a domain, with no extension\
    \ of service to\n   neighboring domains.  Various reasons exist for Diffserv not\
    \ being\n   widely deployed in an inter-domain context, including ones rooted\
    \ in\n   the complexity and problems in supporting the security requirements\n\
    \   for Diffserv codepoints.  An extensive discussion on Diffserv\n   deployment\
    \ is outside the scope of this document.\n   [Baker] presents common examples\
    \ of various codepoints used for\n   well-known applications.  The document does\
    \ not recommend these\n   associations as being standard or fixed.  Rather, the\
    \ examples in\n   [Baker] provide a reference point for known deployments that\
    \ can act\n   as a guide for other network administrators.\n   An argument can\
    \ be made that Diffserv, with its existing codepoint\n   specifications of Assured\
    \ Forwarding (AF) and Expedited Forwarding\n   (EF), goes beyond what would be\
    \ needed to support ETS within a\n   domain.  By this we mean that the complexity\
    \ in terms of maintenance\n   and support of AF or EF may exceed or cause undue\
    \ burden on the\n   management resources of a domain.  Given this possibility,\
    \ users or\n   network administrators may wish to determine if various queuing\n\
    \   mechanisms, like class-based weighted fair queuing, is sufficient to\n   support\
    \ ETS flows through a domain.  Note, as we stated earlier in\n   Section 2, over-provisioning\
    \ is another option to consider.  We\n   assume that if the reader is considering\
    \ something like Diffserv,\n   then it has been determined that over-provisioning\
    \ is not a viable\n   option given their individual needs or capabilities.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Services used to offer better or best available\
    \ service for a\n   particular set of users (in the case of this document, ETS\
    \ users) are\n   prime targets for security attacks or simple misuse.  Hence,\n\
    \   administrators that choose to incorporate additional\n   protocols/services\
    \ to support ETS are strongly encouraged to consider\n   new policies to address\
    \ the added potential of security attacks.\n   These policies, and any additional\
    \ security measures, should be\n   considered independent of any mechanism or\
    \ equipment that restricts\n   access to the administrative domain.\n   Determining\
    \ how authorization is accomplished is an open issue.  Many\n   times the choice\
    \ is a function of the service that is deployed.  One\n   example is source addresses\
    \ in an access list permitting senders to\n   the multicast group (as described\
    \ in Section 4.5).  Within a single\n   domain environment, cases can be found\
    \ where network administrators\n   tend to find this approach acceptable.  However,\
    \ other services may\n   require more stringent measures that employ detailed\
    \ credentials, and\n   possibly multiple levels of access and authentication.\
    \  Ease of use,\n   deployment, scalability, and susceptibility to security breach\
    \ all\n   play a role in determining authorization schemas.  The potential is\n\
    \   that accomplishing this for only a single domain may be easier than\n   at\
    \ the inter-domain scope, if only in terms of scalability and trust.\n"
- title: 6.  Summary Comments
  contents:
  - "6.  Summary Comments\n   This document has presented a number of protocols and\
    \ complementary\n   technologies that can be used to support ETS users.  Their\
    \ selection\n   is dictated by the fact that all or significant portions of the\n\
    \   protocols can be operated and controlled within a single\n   administrative\
    \ domain.  It is this reason why other protocols, like\n   those under current\
    \ development in the Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS)\n   working group, have not\
    \ been discussed.\n   By listing a variety of efforts in this document, we avoid\
    \ taking on\n   the role of \"king maker\" and at the same time indirectly point\
    \ out\n   that a variety of solutions exist in support of ETS.  These solutions\n\
    \   may involve QoS, traffic engineering, or simply protection against\n   detrimental\
    \ conditions (e.g., spikes in traffic load).  Again, the\n   choice is up to the\
    \ reader.\n"
