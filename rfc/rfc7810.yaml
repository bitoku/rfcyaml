  - "1.  Introduction\n   In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial\n\
    \   information networks (e.g., stock market data providers), network-\n   performance\
    \ information (e.g., latency) is becoming as critical to\n   data-path selection\
    \ as other metrics.\n   In these networks, extremely large amounts of money rest\
    \ on the\n   ability to access market data in \"real time\" and to predictably\
    \ make\n   trades faster than the competition.  Because of this, using metrics\n\
    \   such as hop count or cost as routing metrics is becoming only\n   tangentially\
    \ important.  Rather, it would be beneficial to be able to\n   make path-selection\
    \ decisions based on performance data (such as\n   latency) in a cost-effective\
    \ and scalable way.\n   This document describes extensions (hereafter called \"\
    IS-IS TE Metric\n   Extensions\") to the IS-IS Extended Reachability TLV defined\
    \ in\n   [RFC5305], that can be used to distribute network-performance\n   information\
    \ (such as link delay, delay variation, packet loss,\n   residual bandwidth, and\
    \ available bandwidth).\n   The data distributed by the IS-IS TE Metric Extensions\
    \ proposed in\n   this document is meant to be used as part of the operation of\
    \ the\n   routing protocol (e.g., by replacing cost with latency or considering\n\
    \   bandwidth as well as cost), to enhance Constrained-SPF (CSPF), or for\n  \
    \ other uses such as supplementing the data used by an ALTO server\n   [RFC7285].\
    \  With respect to CSPF, the data distributed by IS-IS TE\n   Metric Extensions\
    \ can be used to set up, fail over, and fail back\n   data paths using protocols\
    \ such as RSVP-TE [RFC3209].\n   Note that the mechanisms described in this document\
    \ only disseminate\n   performance information.  The methods for initially gathering\
    \ that\n   performance information, such as described in [RFC6375], or acting\
    \ on\n   it once it is distributed are outside the scope of this document.\n \
    \  Example mechanisms to measure latency, delay variation, and loss in\n   an\
    \ MPLS network are given in [RFC6374].  While this document does not\n   specify\
    \ how the performance information should be obtained, the\n   measurement of delay\
    \ SHOULD NOT vary significantly based upon the\n   offered traffic load.  Thus,\
    \ queuing delays SHOULD NOT be included in\n   the delay measurement.  For links\
    \ such as Forwarding Adjacencies,\n   care must be taken that measurement of the\
    \ associated delay avoids\n   significant queuing delay; that could be accomplished\
    \ in a variety of\n   ways, including either by measuring with a traffic class\
    \ that\n   experiences minimal queuing or by summing the measured link delays\
    \ of\n   the components of the link's path.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  TE Metric Extensions to IS-IS\n   This document registers new IS-IS TE sub-TLVs\
    \ that can be announced\n   in the \"Sub-TLVs for TLVs 22, 23, 141, 222, and 223\"\
    \ registry in\n   order to distribute network-performance information.  The extensions\n\
    \   in this document build on the ones provided in IS-IS TE [RFC5305] and\n  \
    \ GMPLS [RFC4203].\n   IS-IS Extended Reachability TLV 22 (defined in [RFC5305]),\
    \ Inter-AS\n   Reachability Information TLV 141 (defined in [RFC5316]), and MT-ISIS\n\
    \   TLV 222 (defined in [RFC5120]) have nested sub-TLVs that permit the\n   TLVs\
    \ to be readily extended.  This document registers several sub-\n   TLVs:\n  \
    \ Type    Description\n   ----------------------------------------------------\n\
    \    33     Unidirectional Link Delay\n    34     Min/Max Unidirectional Link\
    \ Delay\n    35     Unidirectional Delay Variation\n    36     Unidirectional\
    \ Link Loss\n    37     Unidirectional Residual Bandwidth\n    38     Unidirectional\
    \ Available Bandwidth\n    39     Unidirectional Utilized Bandwidth\n   As can\
    \ be seen in the list above, the sub-TLVs described in this\n   document carry\
    \ different types of network-performance information.\n   The new sub-TLVs include\
    \ a bit called the Anomalous (or \"A\") bit.\n   When the A bit is clear (or when\
    \ the sub-TLV does not include an A\n   bit), the sub-TLV describes steady-state\
    \ link performance.  This\n   information could conceivably be used to construct\
    \ a steady-state\n   performance topology for initial tunnel-path computation,\
    \ or to\n   verify alternative failover paths.\n   When network performance violates\
    \ configurable link-local thresholds,\n   a sub-TLV with the A bit set is advertised.\
    \  These sub-TLVs could be\n   used by the receiving node to determine whether\
    \ to fail traffic to a\n   backup path or whether to calculate an entirely new\
    \ path.  From an\n   MPLS perspective, the intent of the A bit is to permit label\
    \ switched\n   path ingress nodes to determine whether the link referenced in\
    \ the\n   sub-TLV affects any of the label switched paths for which it is\n  \
    \ ingress.  If they are affected, then they can determine whether those\n   label\
    \ switched paths still meet end-to-end performance objectives.\n   If not, then\
    \ the node could conceivably move affected traffic to a\n   pre-established protection\
    \ label switched path or establish a new\n   label switched path and place the\
    \ traffic in it.\n   If link performance then improves beyond a configurable minimum\
    \ value\n   (reuse threshold), that sub-TLV can be re-advertised with the A bit\n\
    \   cleared.  In this case, a receiving node can conceivably do whatever\n   re-optimization\
    \ (or failback) it wishes to do (including nothing).\n   Note that when a sub-TLV\
    \ does not include the A bit, that sub-TLV\n   cannot be used for failover purposes.\
    \  The A bit was intentionally\n   omitted from some sub-TLVs to help mitigate\
    \ oscillations.  See\n   Section 5 for more information.\n   Consistent with existing\
    \ IS-IS TE specification [RFC5305], the\n   bandwidth advertisements defined in\
    \ this document MUST be encoded as\n   IEEE floating-point values.  The delay\
    \ and delay-variation\n   advertisements defined in this document MUST be encoded\
    \ as integer\n   values.  Delay values MUST be quantified in units of microseconds,\n\
    \   packet loss MUST be quantified as a percentage of packets sent, and\n   bandwidth\
    \ MUST be sent as bytes per second.  All values (except\n   residual bandwidth)\
    \ MUST be calculated as rolling averages where the\n   averaging period MUST be\
    \ a configurable period of time.  See\n   Section 5 for more information.\n"

  - "3.  Interface and Neighbor Addresses\n   The use of IS-IS TE Metric Extensions\
    \ sub-TLVs is not confined to the\n   TE context.  In other words, IS-IS TE Metric\

    \ paths in the\n   absence of a TE subsystem.\n   However, as for the TE case,\

  contents:
  - "5.  Announcement Thresholds and Filters\n   The values advertised in all sub-TLVs\
    \ (except min/max delay and\n   residual bandwidth) MUST represent an average\
    \ over a period or be\n   obtained by a filter that is reasonably representative\
    \ of an average.\n   For example, a rolling average is one such filter.\n   Min\
    \ and max delay MUST each be derived in one of the following ways:\n   by taking\
    \ the lowest and/or highest measured value over a measurement\n   interval or\
    \ by making use of a filter or other technique to obtain a\n   reasonable representation\
    \ of a min and max value representative of\n   the interval, with compensation\
    \ for outliers.\n   The measurement interval, any filter coefficients, and any\n\
    \   advertisement intervals MUST be configurable per sub-TLV.\n   In addition\
    \ to the measurement intervals governing re-advertisement,\n   implementations\
    \ SHOULD provide configurable accelerated advertisement\n   thresholds per sub-TLV,\
    \ such that:\n   1.  If the measured parameter falls outside a configured upper\
    \ bound\n       for all but the minimum delay metric (or lower bound for minimum\n\
    \       delay metric only) and the advertised sub-TLV is not already\n       outside\
    \ that bound or,\n   2.  If the difference between the last advertised value and\
    \ current\n       measured value exceeds a configured threshold then,\n   3. \
    \ The advertisement is made immediately.\n   4.  For sub-TLVs that include an\
    \ A bit, an additional threshold\n       SHOULD be included corresponding to the\
    \ threshold for which the\n       performance is considered anomalous (and sub-TLVs\
    \ with the A bit\n       are sent).  The A bit is cleared when the sub-TLV's performance\n\
    \       has been below (or re-crosses) this threshold for an\n       advertisement\
    \ interval(s) to permit fail back.\n   To prevent oscillations, only the high\
    \ threshold or the low threshold\n   (but not both) may be used to trigger any\
    \ given sub-TLV that supports\n   both.\n   Additionally, once outside the bounds\
    \ of the threshold, any\n   re-advertisement of a measurement within the bounds\
    \ would remain\n   governed solely by the measurement interval for that sub-TLV.\n"

    \   lengthen the period within which they are refreshed.\n   Only the accelerated\
    \ advertisement threshold mechanism described in\n   Section 5 may shorten the\

    \ might occur in very large networks\n   if measurement intervals are set low\
    \ enough to overwhelm the\n   processing of flooded information at some of the\
    \ routers in the\n   topology.  Therefore, care should be taken in setting these\
    \ values.\n   Additionally, the default measurement interval for all sub-TLVs\n\
    \   SHOULD be 30 seconds.\n   Announcements MUST also be able to be throttled\
    \ using configurable\n   inter-update throttle timers.  The minimum announcement\
    \ periodicity\n   is 1 announcement per second.  The default value SHOULD be set\
    \ to 120\n   seconds.\n   Implementations SHOULD NOT permit the inter-update timer\
    \ to be lower\n   than the measurement interval.\n   Furthermore, it is RECOMMENDED\
    \ that any underlying performance-\n   measurement mechanisms not include any\
    \ significant buffer delay, any\n   significant buffer-induced delay variation,\
