  - "Abstract\n   The document describes a proxy-based mechanism allowing the use\
    \ of\n   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) by IPv6 nodes in a point-to-\n   multipoint\
    \ architecture with a \"split-horizon\" forwarding scheme,\n   primarily deployed\
    \ for Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) and Fiber access\n   architectures.  Based\
    \ on the DAD signaling, the first-hop router\n   stores in a Binding Table all\
    \ known IPv6 addresses used on a point-\n   to-multipoint domain (e.g., VLAN).\
    \  When a node performs DAD for an\n   address already used by another node, the\
    \ first-hop router defends\n   the address rather than the device using the address.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies a function called Duplicate Address\
    \ Detection\n   (DAD) proxy allowing the use of DAD by the nodes on the same point-\n\
    \   to-multipoint domain with a \"split-horizon\" forwarding scheme,\n   primarily\
    \ deployed for Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) and Fiber access\n   architectures\
    \ [TR-101].  It only impacts the first-hop router and it\n   doesn't need modifications\
    \ on the other IPv6 nodes.  This mechanism\n   is fully effective if all the nodes\
    \ of a point-to-multipoint domain\n   (except the DAD proxy itself) perform DAD.\n\
    \   This document explains also why the DAD mechanism [RFC4862] without a\n  \
    \ proxy cannot be used in a point-to-multipoint architecture with a\n   \"split-horizon\"\
    \ forwarding scheme (IPv6 over PPP [RFC5072] is not\n   affected).  One of the\
    \ main reasons is that, because of this\n   forwarding scheme, IPv6 nodes on the\
    \ same point-to-multipoint domain\n   cannot have direct communication: any communication\
    \ between them must\n   go through the first-hop router of the same domain.\n\
    \   It is assumed in this document that link-layer addresses on a point-\n   to-multipoint\
    \ domain are unique from the first-hop router's point of\n   view (e.g., in an\
    \ untrusted Ethernet architecture, this assumption\n   can be guaranteed thanks\
    \ to mechanisms such as Media Access Control\n   (MAC) address translation performed\
    \ by an aggregation device between\n   IPv6 nodes and the first-hop router).\n"

  - "3.  Why Existing IETF Solutions Are Not Sufficient\n   In a DSL or Fiber access\
    \ architecture depicted in Figure 1, CPE1,\n   CPE2, CPE3, and the BNG are IPv6\
    \ nodes, while AN is an L2 bridge\n   providing connectivity between the BNG and\
    \ each CPE.  The AN enforces\n   a split-horizon model so that CPEs can only send\
    \ and receive frames\n   (e.g., Ethernet frames) to and from the BNG but not to\
    \ each other.\n   That said, the BNG is on the same link with all CPEs, but a\
    \ given CPE\n   is not on the same link with any other CPE.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Duplicate Address Detection
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Duplicate Address Detection\n   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) [RFC4862]\
    \ is performed when an IPv6\n   node verifies the uniqueness of a tentative IPv6\
    \ address.  This node\n   sends a Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message with the\
    \ IP destination\n   set to the solicited-node multicast address of the tentative\
    \ address.\n   This NS message is multicasted to other nodes on the same link.\
    \  When\n   the tentative address is already used on the link by another node,\n\
    \   this last one replies with a Neighbor Advertisement (NA) message to\n   inform\
    \ the first node.  So, when performing DAD, a node expects the\n   NS messages\
    \ to be received by any node currently using the tentative\n   address.\n   However,\
    \ in a point-to-multipoint network with a split-horizon\n   forwarding scheme\
    \ implemented in the AN, the CPEs are prevented from\n   talking to each other\
    \ directly.  All packets sent out from a CPE are\n   forwarded by the AN only\
    \ to the BNG but not to any other CPE.  NS\n   messages sent by a certain CPE\
    \ will be received only by the BNG and\n   will not reach other CPEs.  So, other\
    \ CPEs have no idea that a\n   certain IPv6 address is used by another CPE.  That\
    \ means, in a\n   network with split-horizon, DAD, as defined in [RFC4862], can't\
    \ work\n   properly without additional help.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Neighbor Discovery Proxy
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Neighbor Discovery Proxy\n   Neighbor Discovery (ND) Proxy [RFC4389] is\
    \ designed for forwarding ND\n   messages between different IP links where the\
    \ subnet prefix is the\n   same.  An ND Proxy function on a bridge ensures that\
    \ packets between\n   nodes on different segments can be received by this function\
    \ and have\n   the correct link-layer address type on each segment.  When the\
    \ ND\n   Proxy receives a multicast ND message, it forwards it to all other\n\
    \   interfaces on a same link.\n   In DSL or Fiber networks, when the AN, acting\
    \ as an ND Proxy,\n   receives an ND message from a CPE, it will forward it to\
    \ the BNG but\n   none of the other CPEs, as only the BNG is on the same link\
    \ with the\n   CPE.  Hence, implementing ND Proxy on the AN would not help a CPE\n\
    \   acknowledge link-local addresses used by other CPEs.\n   As the BNG must not\
    \ forward link-local scoped messages sent from a\n   CPE to other CPEs, ND Proxy\
    \ cannot be implemented in the BNG.\n"
- title: 3.3.  6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery
  contents:
  - "3.3.  6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery\n   [RFC6775] defines an optional modification\
    \ of DAD for IPv6 over Low-\n   Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN).\
    \  When a 6LoWPAN node\n   wants to configure an IPv6 address, it registers that\
    \ address with\n   one or more of its default routers using the Address Registration\n\
    \   Option (ARO).  If this address is already owned by another node, the\n   router\
    \ informs the 6LoWPAN node that this address cannot be\n   configured.\n   This\
    \ mechanism requires modifications in all hosts in order to\n   support the ARO.\n"
- title: 3.4.  IPv6 Mobility Manager
  contents:
  - "3.4.  IPv6 Mobility Manager\n   According to [RFC6275], a home agent acts as\
    \ a proxy for mobile nodes\n   when they are away from the home network: the home\
    \ agent defends a\n   mobile node's home address by replying to NS messages with\
    \ NA\n   messages.\n   There is a problem for this mechanism if it is applied\
    \ in a DSL or\n   Fiber public access network.  Operators of such networks require\
    \ that\n   an NA message is only received by the sender of the corresponding NS\n\
    \   message, for security and scalability reasons.  However, the home\n   agent\
    \ per [RFC6275] multicasts NA messages on the home link and all\n   nodes on this\
    \ link will receive these NA messages.  This shortcoming\n   prevents this mechanism\
    \ from being deployed in DSL or Fiber access\n   networks directly.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Duplicate Address Detection Proxy (DAD-Proxy) Specifications\n   First, it\
    \ is important to note that, as this mechanism is strongly\n   based on DAD [RFC4862],\
    \ it is not completely reliable, and the goal\n   of this document is not to fix\
    \ DAD.\n"
- title: 4.1.  DAD-Proxy Data Structure
  contents:
  - "4.1.  DAD-Proxy Data Structure\n   A BNG needs to store in a Binding Table information\
    \ related to the\n   IPv6 addresses generated by any CPE.  This Binding Table\
    \ can be\n   distinct from the Neighbor Cache.  This must be done per point-to-\n\
    \   multipoint domain (e.g., per Ethernet VLAN).  Each entry in this\n   Binding\
    \ Table MUST contain the following fields:\n   o  IPv6 Address\n   o  Link-layer\
    \ Address\n   For security or performances reasons, it must be possible to limit\n\
    \   the number of IPv6 addresses per link-layer address (possibly, but\n   not\
    \ necessarily, to 1).\n   On the reception of an unsolicited NA (e.g., when a\
    \ CPE wishes to\n   inform its neighbors of a new link-layer address) for an IPv6\
    \ address\n   already recorded in the Binding Table, each entry associated to\
    \ this\n   IPv6 address MUST be updated consequently: the current link-layer\n\
    \   address is replaced by the one included in the unsolicited NA\n   message.\n\
    \   For security or performances reasons, the Binding Table MUST be large\n  \
    \ enough for the deployment in which it is used: if the Binding Table\n   is distinct\
    \ from the Neighbor Cache, it MUST be at least the same\n   size as this last\
    \ one.  Implementations MUST either state the fixed\n   size of the Binding Table\
    \ that they support or make the size\n   configurable.  In the latter case, implementations\
    \ MUST state the\n   largest Binding Table size that they support.  Additionally,\n\
    \   implementations SHOULD allow an operator to inquire about the current\n  \
    \ occupancy level of the Binding Table to determine if it is about to\n   become\
    \ full.  Implementations encountering a full Binding Table will\n   likely handle\
    \ it in a way similar to NS message loss.\n   It is recommended to apply technical\
    \ solutions to minimize the risk\n   that the Binding Table becomes full.  These\
    \ solutions are out of the\n   scope of this document.\n"
- title: 4.2.  DAD-Proxy Mechanism
  contents:
  - "4.2.  DAD-Proxy Mechanism\n   When a CPE performs DAD, as specified in [RFC4862],\
    \ it sends a\n   Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message, with the unspecified address\
    \ as\n   the source address, in order to check if a tentative address is\n   already\
    \ in use on the link.  The BNG receives this message and MUST\n   perform actions\
    \ specified in the following sections based on the\n   information in the Binding\
    \ Table.\n"

  contents:

    \   o  IPv6 Address field set to the tentative address in the NS message.\n  \
    \ o  Link-layer Address field set to the link-layer source address in\n      the\
    \ link-layer header of the NS message.\n   The BNG MUST NOT reply to the CPE or\
    \ forward the NS message.\n"
- title: 4.2.2.  An Entry Already Exists for the Tentative Address
  contents:
  - "4.2.2.  An Entry Already Exists for the Tentative Address\n   When there is an\
    \ entry for the tentative address, the BNG MUST check\n   the following conditions:\n\
    \   o  The address in the Target Address field in the NS message is equal\n  \
    \    to the address in the IPv6 Address field in the entry.\n   o  The source\
    \ address of the IPv6 Header in the NS message is equal\n      to the unspecified\
    \ address.\n   When these conditions are met and the source address of the link-\n\
    \   layer header in the NS message is equal to the address in the Link-\n   layer\
    \ Address field in the entry, that means the CPE is still\n   performing DAD for\
    \ this address.  The BNG MUST NOT reply to the CPE\n   or forward the NS message.\n\
    \   When these conditions are met and the source address of the link-\n   layer\
    \ header in the NS message is not equal to the address in the\n   Link-layer Address\
    \ field in the entry, that means possibly another\n   CPE is performing DAD for\
    \ an already owned address.  The BNG then has\n   to verify whether there is a\
    \ real conflict by checking if the CPE\n   whose IPv6 address is in the entry\
    \ is still connected.  In the\n   following text, we will call IPv6-CPE1 the IPv6\
    \ address of the\n   existing entry in the Binding Table, Link-layer-CPE1 the\
    \ link-layer\n   address of that entry, and Link-layer-CPE2 the link-layer address\
    \ of\n   the CPE that is performing DAD, which is different from Link-layer-\n\
    \   CPE1.\n   The BNG MUST check if the potential address conflict is real.  In\n\
    \   particular:\n   o  If IPv6-CPE1 is in the Neighbor Cache and it is associated\
    \ with\n      Link-layer-CPE1, the reachability of IPv6-CPE1 MUST be confirmed\n\
    \      as explained in Section 4.2.3.\n   o  If IPv6-CPE1 is in the Neighbor Cache,\
    \ but in this cache it is\n      associated with a link-layer address other than\
    \ Link-layer-CPE1,\n      that means that there is possibly a conflict with another\
    \ CPE, but\n      that CPE did not perform DAD.  This situation is out of the\
    \ scope\n      of this document, since one assumption made above is that all the\n\
    \      nodes of a point-to-multipoint domain (except the DAD proxy\n      itself)\
    \ perform DAD.\n   o  If IPv6-CPE1 is not in the Neighbor Cache, then the BNG\
    \ MUST\n      create a new entry based on the information of the entry in the\n\
    \      Binding Table.  This step is necessary in order to trigger the\n      reachability\
    \ check as explained in Section 4.2.3.  The entry in\n      the Neighbor Cache\
    \ MUST be created based on the algorithm defined\n      in Section 7.3.3 of [RFC4861],\
    \ in particular by treating this case\n      as though a packet other than a solicited\
    \ Neighbor Advertisement\n      were received from IPv6-CPE1.  Thus, the new entry\
    \ of the Neighbor\n      Cache MUST contain the following information:\n     \
    \ *  IPv6 address: IPv6-CPE1\n      *  Link-layer address: Link-layer-CPE1\n \
    \     *  State: STALE\n      The reachability of IPv6-CPE1 MUST be confirmed as\
    \ soon as\n      possible following the procedure explained in Section 4.2.3.\n"

    \   Given that the IPv6-CPE1 is in an entry of the Neighbor Cache, the\n   reachability\

    \ and emit alarms whenever a\n   duplication of IPv6 addresses is detected by\
    \ the DAD-Proxy function.\n   Moreover, the BNG SHOULD implement a function to\
    \ allow an operator to\n   access logs and to see the current entries in the Binding\
    \ Table.  The\n   management of access rights to get this information is out of\
    \ the\n   scope of this document.\n"

  - "6.1.  Interoperability with SEND\n   The mechanism described in this document\
    \ will not interoperate with\n   SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) [RFC3971]. \
    \ This is due to the BNG\n   not owning the private key associated with the Cryptographically\n\
    \   Generated Address (CGA) [RFC3972] needed to correctly sign the\n   proxied\
    \ ND messages [RFC5909].\n   Secure Proxy ND Support for SEND [RFC6496] has been\
