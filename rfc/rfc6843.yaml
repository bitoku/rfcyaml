    - "1.1.  Packet Delay Metrics Block\n   This document defines a new block type
      to augment those defined in\n   [RFC3611] for use in a range of RTP applications.
      \ The new block type\n   supports the reporting of the mean, minimum, and maximum
      values of\n   the network round-trip delay between RTP interfaces in peer RTP
      end\n   systems as measured, for example, using the RTCP method described in\n
      \  [RFC3550].  It also supports reporting of the component of the round-\n   trip
      delay internal to the local RTP system.\n   The network metrics belong to the
      class of transport metrics defined\n   in [RFC6792].\n"

  - contents:
    - "1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports\n   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined
      in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]\n   defined an extensible structure for reporting using
      an RTCP Extended\n   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report
      block for\n   use with [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].\n"

    - "1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework\n   The Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390]
      provides guidance on the\n   definition and specification of performance metrics.
      \ The RTP\n   Monitoring Architectures [RFC6792] provides guidelines for reporting\n
      \  block format using RTCP XR.  The metrics block described in this\n   document
      is in accordance with the guidelines in [RFC6390] and\n   [RFC6792].\n"
    title: 1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework
  - contents:
    - "1.4.  Applicability\n   These metrics are applicable to a range of RTP applications
      in which\n   this report block would be useful, such as multimedia conferencing\n
      \  and streaming audio and video.  Knowledge of the round-trip delay and\n   delay
      characteristics can aid other receivers in sizing their receive\n   buffers
      and selecting a playout delay.  The same information is also\n   valuable to
      network managers in troubleshooting network and user\n   experience issues.\n"

    stream.  Instances of this metrics block refer by synchronization\n   source (SSRC)
    to the separate auxiliary Measurement Information block\n   [RFC6776], which contains
    measurement periods (see [RFC6776], Section\n   4.2).  This metrics block relies
    on the measurement period in the\n   Measurement Information block indicating
    the span of the report and\n   SHOULD be sent in the same compound RTCP packet
    as the Measurement\n   Information block.  If the measurement period is not received
    in the\n   same compound RTCP packet as this metrics block, this metrics block\n

    title: 3.1.  Report Block Structure
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Definition of Fields in Delay Metrics Report Block\n   Block type (BT):
      8 bits\n      A Delay Report Block is identified by the constant 16.\n   Interval
      Metric flag (I): 2 bit\n      This field is used to indicate whether the delay
      metrics are\n      Sampled, Interval or Cumulative metrics:\n         I=10:
      Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the\n         most recent
      measurement interval duration between successive\n         metrics reports.\n
      \        I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to the\n         accumulation
      period characteristic of cumulative measurements.\n         I=01: Sampled Value
      - the reported value is a sampled\n         instantaneous value.\n   Reserved
      (resv): 6 bits\n      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set to zero by
      senders and\n      ignored by receivers (see [RFC6709], Section 4.2).\n   block
      length: 16 bits\n      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus
      one.  For\n      the delay block, the block length is equal to 6.\n   SSRC of
      source: 32 bits\n      As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].\n   Mean Network
      Round-Trip Delay: 32 bits\n      The Mean Network Round-Trip Delay is the mean
      value of the RTP-to-\n      RTP interface round-trip delay over the measurement
      period,\n      expressed in units of 1/65536 seconds.  This value is typically\n
      \     determined using \"the NTP timestamp field\" in the RTCP sender\n      report
      (SR) and \"the last SR (LSR) field\",\"delay since last SR\n      (DLSR) field\"
      in the RTCP receiver report (RR) (see [RFC3550],\n      Section 6.4.1 and Figure
      2).  It also can be determined using \"the\n      NTP timestamp field\" in the
      RTCP Receiver Reference Time Report\n      Block and \"last RR (LRR) field\",
      \"delay since last RR (DLRR)\n      field\" in the DLRR Report Block (see [RFC3611],
      Section 4.5).\n      If only one measurement of Round-Trip Delay is available
      for the\n      time span of the report (i.e., the measurement period) (whether\n
      \     Interval or Cumulative), this single value SHOULD be reported as\n      the
      mean value.\n      If the measurement is unavailable, the value of this field
      with\n      all bits set to 1 MUST be reported.\n   Min Network Round-Trip Delay:
      32 bits\n      The Min Network Round Trip Delay is the minimum value of the
      RTP-\n      to-RTP interface round-trip delay over the measurement period,\n
      \     expressed in units of 1/65536 seconds.  This value is typically\n      determined
      using the NTP timestamp field in the RTCP SR and LSR\n      field and DLSR field
      in the RTCP RR.  It also can be determined\n      using the NTP timestamp field
      in the RTCP Receiver Reference Time\n      Report Block and LRR field and DLRR
      field in the DLRR Report\n      Block.\n      If only one measurement of Round
      Trip Delay is available for the\n      time span of the report (i.e., the measurement
      period) (whether\n      Interval or Cumulative), this single value SHOULD be
      reported as\n      the minimum value.\n      If the measurement is unavailable,
      the value of this field with\n      all bits set to 1 MUST be reported.\n   Max
      Network Round-Trip Delay: 32 bits\n      The Max Network Round-Trip Delay is
      the maximum value of the RTP-\n      to-RTP interface round-trip delay over
      the measurement period,\n      expressed in units of 1/65536 seconds.  This
      value is typically\n      determined using the NTP timestamp field in the RTCP
      SR and LSR\n      field and DLSR field in the RTCP RR.  It also can be determined\n
      \     using the NTP timestamp field in the RTCP Receiver Reference Time\n      Report
      Block and LRR field and DLRR field in the DLRR Report\n      Block.\n      If
      only one measurement of Round-Trip Delay is available for the\n      time span
      of the report (i.e.,the measurement period) (whether\n      Interval or Cumulative),
      this single value SHOULD be reported as\n      the maximum value.\n      If
      the measurement is unavailable, the value of this field with\n      all bits
      set to 1 MUST be reported.\n   End System Delay: 64 bits\n      The End System
      Delay is the internal round-trip delay within the\n      reporting endpoint,
      calculated using the nominal value of the\n      jitter buffer delay plus the
      accumulation/encoding and decoding/\n      playout delay associated with the
      codec being used.  The value of\n      this field is represented using a 64-bit
      NTP-format timestamp as\n      defined in [RFC5905], which is a 64-bit unsigned
      fixed-point\n      number with the integer part in the first 32 bits and the\n
      \     fractional part in the last 32 bits.\n      If the measurement is unavailable,
      the value of this field with\n      all bits set to 1 MUST be reported.\n"
