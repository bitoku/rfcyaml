  - "1.  Introduction\n   This specification introduces an alternative, low-latency\
    \ security\n   mechanism for protecting signaling related to the route optimization\n\
    \   in Mobile IPv6.  The default mechanism specified in [1] uses a\n   periodic\
    \ return routability test to verify both the \"right\" of the\n   mobile node\
    \ to use a specific home address, as well as the validity\n   of the claimed care-of\
    \ address.  That mechanism requires no\n   configuration and no trusted entities\
    \ beyond the mobile node's home\n   agent.\n   The mechanism specified in this\
    \ document, however, requires the\n   configuration of a shared secret between\
    \ mobile node and its\n   correspondent node.  As a result, messages relating\
    \ to the\n   routability tests can be omitted, leading to significantly smaller\n\
    \   latency.  In addition, the right to use a specific home address is\n   ensured\
    \ in a stronger manner than in [1].  On the other hand, the\n   applicability\
    \ of this mechanisms is limited due to the need for\n   preconfiguration.  This\
    \ mechanism is also limited to use only in\n   scenarios where mobile nodes can\
    \ be trusted not to misbehave, as the\n   validity of the claimed care-of addresses\
    \ is not verified.\n   The keywords \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [2].  Other\n   terminology is used as already defined in [1].\n"
- title: 2.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "2.  Applicability Statement\n   This mechanism is useful in scenarios where the\
    \ following conditions\n   are all met:\n    -  Mobile node and correspondent\
    \ node are administered within the\n       same domain.\n    -  The correspondent\
    \ node has good reason to trust the actions of\n       the mobile node.  In particular,\
    \ the correspondent node needs to\n       be certain that the mobile node will\
    \ not launch flooding attacks\n       against a third party as described in [5].\n\
    \    -  The configuration effort related to this mechanism is acceptable.\n  \
    \     Users MUST be able to generate/select a sufficiently good value\n      \
    \ for Kcn (see [3])\n    -  There is a desire to take advantage of higher efficiency\
    \ or\n       greater assurance with regards to the correctness of the home\n \
    \      address offered via this mechanism.\n    -  This mechanism is used only\
    \ for authenticating Binding Update\n       messages (and not, e.g., data), so\
    \ the total volume of traffic is\n       low (see RFC 4107 [4], and the discussion\
    \ in section 4).\n   This mechanism can also be useful in software development,\
    \ testing,\n   and diagnostics related to mobility signaling.\n   Generally speaking,\
    \ the required level of trust that the\n   correspondent node needs for enabling\
    \ a precomputable Kbm with a\n   mobile node is more often found within relatively\
    \ small, closed\n   groups of users who are personally familiar with each other,\
    \ or who\n   have some external basis for establishing trustworthy interactions.\n\
    \   A typical example scenario where this mechanism is applicable is\n   within\
    \ a corporation, or between specific users.  Application in the\n   general Internet\
    \ is typically not possible due to the effort that is\n   required to manually\
    \ configure the correspondent nodes.  Application\n   at a public network operator\
    \ is typically not possible due to\n   requirements placed on the trustworthiness\
    \ of mobile nodes.\n"
- title: 3.  Precomputing a Binding Management Key (Kbm)
  contents:
  - "3.  Precomputing a Binding Management Key (Kbm)\n   A mobile node and a correspondent\
    \ node may preconfigure data useful\n   for creating a Binding Management Key\
    \ (Kbm), which can then be used\n   for authorizing binding management messages,\
    \ especially Binding\n   Update and Binding Acknowledgement messages.  This data\
    \ is as\n   follows:\n    -  A shared key (Kcn) used to generate keygen tokens,\
    \ at least 20\n       octets long\n    -  A nonce for use when generating the\
    \ care-of keygen token\n    -  A nonce for use when generating the home keygen\
    \ token\n   The keygen tokens MUST be generated from Kcn and the nonces as\n \
    \  specified in Mobile IPv6 [1] return routability.  Likewise, the\n   binding\
    \ management key Kbm must subsequently be generated from the\n   keygen tokens\
    \ in the same way as specified in Mobile IPv6 [1].  The\n   preconfigured data\
    \ is associated to the mobile node's home address.\n   Kcn MUST be generated with\
    \ sufficient randomness (see RFC 4086 [3]).\n   Replay protection for Binding\
    \ Update messages using Kbm computed from\n   the preconfigured data depends upon\
    \ the value of the Sequence Number\n   field in the Binding Update.  If the correspondent\
    \ node does not\n   maintain information about the recently used values of that\
    \ field,\n   then there may be an opportunity for a malicious node to replay old\n\
    \   Binding Update messages and fool the correspondent node into routing\n   toward\
    \ an old care-of address.  For this reason, a correspondent node\n   that uses\
    \ a precomputable Kbm also MUST keep track of the most recent\n   value of the\
    \ Sequence Number field of Binding Update messages using\n   the precomputable\
    \ Kbm value (for example, by committing it to stable\n   storage).\n   When a\
    \ Binding Update is to be authenticated using such a\n   precomputable binding\
    \ key (Kbm), the Binding Authorization Data\n   suboption MUST be present.  The\
    \ Nonce Indices option SHOULD NOT be\n   present.  If it is present, the nonce\
    \ indices supplied SHOULD be\n   ignored and are not included as part of the calculation\
    \ for the\n   authentication data, which is to be performed exactly as specified\
    \ in\n   [1].\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   A correspondent node and a mobile node may use\
    \ a precomputable\n   binding management key (Kbm) to manage the authentication\n\
    \   requirements for binding cache management messages.  Such keys must\n   be\
    \ handled carefully to avoid inadvertent exposure to the threats\n   outlined\
    \ in [5].  Many requirements listed in this document are\n   intended to ensure\
    \ the safety of the manual configuration.  In\n   particular, Kcn MUST be generated\
    \ with sufficient randomness (see RFC\n   4086 [3]), as noted in Section 3.\n\
    \   Manually configured keys MUST be used in conformance with RFC 4107\n   [4].\
    \  Used according to the applicability statement, and with the\n   other security\
    \ measures mandated in this specification, the keys will\n   satisfy the properties\
    \ in that document.  In order to ensure\n   protection against dictionary attacks,\
    \ the configured security\n   information is intended to be used ONLY for authenticating\
    \ Binding\n   Update messages.\n   A mobile node MUST use a different value for\
    \ Kcn for each node in its\n   Binding Update List, and a correspondent node MUST\
    \ ensure that every\n   mobile node uses a different value of Kcn.  This ensures\
    \ that the\n   sender of a Binding Update can always be uniquely determined. \
    \ This\n   is necessary, as this authorization method does not provide any\n \
    \  guarantee that the given care-of address is legitimate.  For the same\n   reason,\
    \ this method SHOULD only be applied between nodes that are\n   under the same\
    \ administration.  The return routability procedure is\n   RECOMMENDED for all\
    \ general use and MUST be the default, unless the\n   user explicitly overrides\
    \ this by entering the aforementioned\n   preconfigured data for a particular\
    \ peer.\n   Replay protection for the Binding Authorization Data option\n   authentication\
    \ mechanism is provided by the Sequence Number field of\n   the Binding Update.\
    \  This method of providing replay protection fails\n   when the Binding Update\
    \ sequence numbers cycle through the 16 bit\n   counter (i.e., not more than 65,536\
    \ distinct uses of Kbm), or if the\n   sequence numbers are not protected against\
    \ reboots.  If the mobile\n   node were to send a fresh Binding Update to its\
    \ correspondent node\n   every hour, 24 hours a day, every day of the year, this\
    \ would require\n   changing keys every 7 years.  Even if the mobile node were\
    \ to do so\n   every minute, this would provide protection for over a month. \
    \ Given\n   typical mobility patterns, there is little danger of replay problems;\n\
    \   nodes for which problems might arise are expected to use methods\n   other\
    \ than manual configuration for Kcn and the associated nonces.\n   When the Sequence\
    \ Number field rolls over, the parties SHOULD\n   configure a new value for Kcn,\
    \ so that new Kbm values will be\n   computed.\n   If a correspondent node does\
    \ NOT keep track of the sequence number\n   for Binding Update messages from a\
    \ particular mobile node, then the\n   correspondent node could be fooled into\
    \ accepting an old value for\n   the mobile node's care-of address.  In the unlikely\
    \ event that this\n   address was reallocated to another IPv6 node in the meantime,\
    \ that\n   IPv6 node would then be vulnerable to unwanted traffic emanating from\n\
    \   the correspondent node.\n   Note that where a node has been configured to\
    \ use the mechanism\n   specified in this document with a particular peer, it\
    \ SHOULD NOT\n   attempt to use another mechanism, even if the peer requests this\
    \ or\n   claims not to support the mechanism in this document.  This is\n   necessary\
    \ in order to prevent bidding down attacks.\n   There is no upper bound on the\
    \ lifetime defined for the precomputable\n   Kbm.  As noted, the key is very likely\
    \ to be quite secure over the\n   lifetime of the security association and usefulness\
    \ of applications\n   between a mobile node and correspondent node that fit the\
    \ terms\n   specified in section 2.\n"
