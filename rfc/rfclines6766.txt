Abstract This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
This document proposes an extension to the GBOND MIB module with a set of objects for managing multi pair bonded xDSL interfaces using Time Division Inverse Multiplexing (TDIM), as defined in ITU T Recommendation G.998.3.
Introduction Multi pair bonding using Time Division Inverse Multiplexing (TDIM), a.k.a. G.Bond/TDIM, is specified in ITU T Recommendation G.998.3 [G.998.3], which defines a method for bonding (or aggregating)
multiple xDSL lines (or individual bearer channels in multiple xDSL lines) into a single bidirectional logical link carrying a mix of various traffic streams, e.g., Ethernet, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Time Division Multiplexing (TDM).
The MIB module defined in this document provides G.Bond/TDIM specific objects for the management of G.998.3 bonded interfaces, extending the common bonding objects specified in the GBOND MIB [RFC6765] module.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
The Broadband Forum Management Framework for xDSL Bonding
This document makes use of the Broadband Forum technical report "Management Framework for xDSL Bonding" [TR 159], defining a management model and a hierarchy of management objects for the bonded xDSL interfaces.
Relationship to Other MIB Modules
This section outlines the relationship of the MIB modules defined in this document with other MIB modules described in the relevant RFCs.
Specifically, the following MIB modules are discussed: the Interfaces Group MIB (IF MIB) and the G.Bond MIB (GBOND MIB).
Relationship to the Interfaces Group MIB Module A G.Bond/TDIM port is a private case of a bonded multi pair xDSL interface and as such is managed using generic interface management objects defined in the IF MIB
In particular, an interface index (ifIndex) is used to index instances of G.Bond/TDIM ports, as well as xDSL lines/channels, in a managed system.
The GBOND MIB module [RFC6765] defines management objects common for all bonded multi pair xDSL interfaces.
In particular, it describes the bonding management, bonded port and channel configuration, initialization sequence, etc.
Both the GBOND MIB and G9983 MIB modules are REQUIRED to manage a G.Bond/TDIM port.
All management objects defined in the G9983 MIB module are contained in a single group g9983Port.
This group is further split into 6 sub groups, structured as recommended by RFC 4181
[RFC4181]:  g9983PortNotifications containing notifications (TDIM Service 'down'/'up').
g9983PortConfTable containing objects for configuration of a G.Bond/TDIM port.
g9983PortCapTable containing objects reflecting capabilities of a G.Bond/TDIM port.
g9983PortStatTable containing objects providing overall status information of a G.Bond/TDIM port, complementing the generic status information from the ifTable of the IF MIB and the gBondPortStatFltStatus of GBOND MIB.
g9983SvcTable containing objects for configuration and status of the services in a G.Bond/TDIM port.
g9983PM containing objects for OPTIONAL historical Performance Monitoring (PM) of a G.Bond/TDIM port.
The G.Bond/TDIM specification allows an optional Forward Error Correction (FEC) and Interleaver block, which if supported and enabled provides a degree of protection against micro interruptions, alien noise, and even individual Bonding Channel Entity (BCE) failures, a.k.a. cut line protection.
Management objects in the g9983PortConfTable can be used to configure and query the FEC and Interleaver function of the G.Bond/TDIM port.
Service Configuration Unlike the other two xDSL Multi Pair Bonding schemes (G.Bond/ATM and G.Bond/Ethernet), which send the information required for reassembly of the fragmented data along with the data, G.Bond/TDIM is a synchronous scheme, requiring both ends to know the data distribution tables before any actual data transfer can happen.
Management objects in the g9983PortConfTable (g9983PortConfAdminServices), g9983SvcTable, and g9983OperSvcTable can be used to configure and query the configuration of services transported via the G.Bond/TDIM link.
The services may be configured independently of the link state (i.e., in service and out of  service), as G.998.3 communicates changes in the service configuration via specific Bonding Communication Channel (BCC) messages, switching both ends of the link to the new configuration synchronously.
There can be up to 60 active services defined on a G.Bond/TDIM link.
This MIB module provides an ability to define up to 255 services via the g9983SvcTable, with each row representing a possible service, and then set the actual service configuration using the g9983PortConfAdminServices object (a byte vector of service indices), listing the active services in the order of their position in the G.Bond/TDIM frame.
This design allows one to easily modify service drop priority, which directly corresponds to the service position.
The actual list of services is provided via the read only g9983OperSvcTable, where each entry's index corresponds to the service position, starting from index 1 for the first entry, 2 for the second entry, etc., providing an easy service navigation for a management application using GET NEXT (instead of counting bytes in the g9983PortConfAdminServices object).
The service configuration can only be changed on a Bonding Terminating Unit at the Central Office (BTU C).
When configuring the services, please bear in mind that the sum of all the services' bandwidth SHOULD be less than or equal to the target data rate of the bonded link.
Note that G.Bond/TDIM links are symmetrical; i.e., their upstream data rate equals the downstream data rate.
Management of TDM Services and Service Drop Priority during Bandwidth Degradation
The G.Bond/TDIM protocol provides an ability to map TDM services into the TDIM bonded link directly, without any additional overhead.
It addresses only structure agnostic TDM transport, disregarding any structure that may be imposed on these streams, in particular, the structure imposed by the standard TDM framing [G.704].
During bandwidth degradation, services with a lower priority are impaired or dropped first.
Synchronous services (fractional DS1/E1, clear channel E1/T1, T3/E3, clock) that are positioned in the beginning of the G.Bond/TDIM frame have higher priority than asynchronous services (Ethernet, ATM, Generic Framing Procedure (GFP)
encapsulated) that are positioned farther away.
Within the services of the same type, those with a lower position (index) have higher priority.
This MIB module provides specific 'up'/'down' notifications (g9983SvcUp/g9983SvcDown) for each of the configured services.
During bandwidth degradation, a number of services may be suspended (dropped) simultaneously, according to their drop priority (position in the service list).
Please note that it is possible for a higher  priority service to be dropped before a lower priority one.
For example, suppose there are two services configured on a 2 Mbps G.Bond/TDIM link: a T1 service (g9983SvcType with a value of ds1, with a bandwidth requirement of 1.5 Mbps), and an Ethernet service with a size of 0.5 Mbps.
When the actual link bandwidth is reduced to 1.4 Mbps, the T1 service with a g9983OperSvcPosition value of 1 would be dropped, while the Ethernet service with a g9983OperSvcPosition value of 2 would remain up.
Notifications SHOULD be rate limited (throttled)
such that there is an implementation specific gap between the generation of consecutive notifications of the same event.
This mechanism prevents "notification flooding" in cases where g9983OperSvcState oscillates between the 'up' and 'down' states.
When notifications are rate  limited, they are dropped and not queued for sending at a future time.
This is intended to be a general rate limiting statement for notifications that otherwise have no explicit rate limiting assertions in this document.
Performance Monitoring The OPTIONAL Performance Monitoring counters, thresholds, and history buckets (interval counters), similar to those defined in [TR 159],
are implemented using the textual conventions defined in the HC PerfHist TC MIB [RFC3705].
PerfHist TC MIB defines 64 bit versions of the textual conventions found in the PerfHist TC MIB [RFC3593].
The agent SHOULD align the beginning of each interval to a fifteen  minute boundary of a wall clock.
Likewise, the beginning of each one day interval SHOULD be aligned with the start of a day.
Counters are not reset when a G.Bond TDIM port is re initialized, but rather only when the agent is reset or re initialized.
Note that the accumulation of certain performance events for a monitored entity is inhibited (counting stops) during periods of service unavailability on that entity.
The DESCRIPTION clause of Performance Monitoring counters in this MIB module specifies which of the counters are inhibited during periods of service unavailability.
Mapping of Broadband Forum TR 159 and ITU T G.998.3
This section contains the mapping between relevant managed objects (attributes) defined in [TR 159] and the managed objects defined in this document.
Note that all management objects defined in [G.998.3] have corresponding objects in [TR 159].
: Mapping of TR 159 Managed Objects Note that some of the mapping between the objects defined in TR 159 and the ones defined in this MIB module is not one to one; for example, while TR 159 PM attributes aGroupPerf  map to the corresponding gBondPortPm  objects of the GBOND MIB module, there are no dedicated PM attributes for the g9983PortPm  and g9983SvcPm  objects introduced in this MIB module.
However, since their definition is identical to the definition of gBondPortPm  objects of the GBOND MIB module, we can map g9983PortPm  and g9983SvcPm  to the relevant aGroupPerf  attributes of TR 159 and use the term 'partial mapping' to denote the fact that this mapping is not one to one.

"The compliance statement for G.Bond/TDIM interfaces.
Compliance with the following external compliance statements is REQUIRED:
There are a number of managed objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
Changing of the g9983PortConfAdminServices object may lead to a potential service disruption, by changing a particular service's position (therefore changing its drop priority) or even removing the service from the link altogether.
Changing of g9983SvcTable configuration parameters (e.g., g9983SvcType or g9983SvcSize) may lead to a potential service impairment; for example, a TDM service would be dropped if there is not enough actual bandwidth on the bonded link to support this service.
Changing of g9983PortConfTable configuration parameters (e.g., g9983PortConfFecAdminState) may lead to anything from link quality and rate degradation to a complete link initialization failure.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., those with MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments since, collectively, they provide information about the performance of network interfaces and can reveal some aspects of their configuration.
In particular, since a bonded xDSL port can be comprised of multiple Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) voice grade copper, located in the same bundle with other pairs belonging to another operator/customer, it is theoretically possible to eavesdrop on a G.Bond transmission, simply by "listening" to cross talk from the bonded pairs, especially if the operating parameters of the G.Bond link in question are known.
It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
g9983PortStatFecOperState in the g9983PortStatTable indicates whether the FEC function is enabled, which may aid in deciphering the G.Bond/TDIM transmissions.
The g9983OperSvcTable provides current operational service configuration, which may aid in deciphering the G.Bond/TDIM transmissions.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for authentication and privacy via the User based Security Model (USM)
[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
IANA Considerations IANA has allocated value 210 as the Object identifier for g9983MIB MODULE IDENTITY <http://www.iana.org/
> in the MIB 2 transmission sub tree.
