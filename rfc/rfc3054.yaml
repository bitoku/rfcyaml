  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document represents the current view from the TIA working\
    \ group\n   on VoIP (Voice over IP) telephone specification [1], TIA TR-41.3.4,\n\
    \   with the intent of using this as part of its \"whole device\"\n   specification\
    \ as an optional method of device control.\n   Industry feedback has made it clear\
    \ that interoperability and\n   acoustic performance of Internet telephones is\
    \ key to the rapid and\n   extensive commercialization of these products.  To\
    \ facilitate this,\n   the TIA has established working group TR-41.3.4 to develop\
    \ a standard\n   for VoIP telephones.  The TR-41.3.4 working group has included\
    \ the\n   \"whole device\" within the scope of the standard, so a full range of\n\
    \   requirements including acoustic performance, protocols, methods for\n   powering\
    \ and safety are provided.  Where possible, the requirements\n   are based on\
    \ existing standards, which are included by reference.\n   The TIA TR-41.3.4 working\
    \ group has also recognized that its proposed\n   standard must enable creative\
    \ application of the equipment, encourage\n   the development of new capabilities\
    \ and allow for high levels of\n   product customization.  To achieve this, peer\
    \ to peer architectures\n   that are based on protocols such as H.323 or SIP and\
    \ master/slave\n   architectures such as Megaco/H.248 Protocol are both necessary\
    \ and\n   complementary.\n   In support of the Megaco/H.248 Protocol development\
    \ effort, the TR-\n   41.3.4 working group has considered product enabling issues\
    \ and\n   requirements, and has developed an approach to use the Megaco/H.248\n\
    \   Protocol for Internet telephone device control.  This document\n   represents\
    \ the working group's current view.\n   This document covers the general requirements\
    \ of the Megaco IP Phone\n   application (section 3), architectural approach and\
    \ MG organization\n   (section 4), details of specific Termination types used\
    \ and Packages\n   supported by each (section 5), and the Megaco IP Phone Protocol\n\
    \   Profile (section 6).\n"

    \ design approach and\n   organization of the Megaco IP Phone MG.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Design Approach
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Design Approach\n   Design intent of the Megaco IP Phone is to keep it\
    \ determinedly\n   simple while providing required support for fully featured\
    \ business\n   telephones and the flexibility to allow for a very wide range of\n\
    \   telephone configurations and similar appliances.\n   The approach to achieve\
    \ this goal is to provide a very simple and\n   direct master/slave control model\
    \ in which very little feature\n   intelligence is required in the end device.\
    \  This design intent\n   matches the Megaco/H.248 Protocol approach well.\n \
    \  It is important to note that additional functionality, built-in\n   feature\
    \ capability or system-specific optimization can easily be\n   provided, at the\
    \ option of the implementer, by defining additional\n   Termination types, Event/Signal\
    \ Packages, or providing built-in\n   application capability.  This document defines\
    \ the minimal design\n   only.\n"
- title: 4.2.  General Structure
  contents:
  - "4.2.  General Structure\n   As shown in Figure 1 below, the Megaco IP Phone is\
    \ organized as a\n   Media Gateway (MG) that consists of a User Interface Termination\
    \ and\n   a set of Audio Transducer Terminations.\n   Several - potentially thousands\
    \ - of Megaco IP Phone MGs may be\n   controlled by a single Media Gateway Controller\
    \ (MGC).  This is\n   distinguished from the organization between traditional\
    \ analog or PBX\n   telephones behind an IP network, where the MGC would control\
    \ an MG\n   which in turn controls the collection of telephone devices in\n  \
    \ question.  In the case of a Megaco IP Phone MG, the MG directly\n   implements\
    \ the media terminations like handset, handsfree and\n   headset, as well as the\
    \ user interface.  In this case, the Megaco IP\n   Phone itself is the MG.\n \

- title: 4.3.  Termination / Package Organization
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Termination / Package Organization\n   As shown in Figure 1, each Audio\
    \ Transducer Termination represents an\n   individually controllable audio input/output\
    \ element of the telephone\n   device, such as Handset, Handsfree, Headset, etc.\
    \  By separating each\n   audio element as a distinct Termination, more flexible\
    \ applications\n   can be easily implemented, such as paging, group listening,\
    \ and so\n   on. Since this is actually only the logical view of the device,\n\
    \   represented by protocol, it is also quite possible to simplify\n   representation\
    \ of the device by hiding all available audio\n   input/outputs behind a single\
    \ Audio Transducer Termination, for\n   example the Handset, and implement control\
    \ of multiple real\n   input/outputs locally inside the device.\n   All non-audio\
    \ user interface elements are associated with the User\n   Interface Termination.\
    \  This special Termination supports Packages to\n   implement all user interaction\
    \ with the telephone user interface,\n   including Function Keys, Indicators,\
    \ the Dialpad, etc, as appropriate\n   for the specific device capabilities (within\
    \ constraints given in the\n   section on User Interface Termination).  The User\
    \ Interface\n   Termination cannot be placed in any Context.  This grouping of\
    \ user\n   interface elements behind a well-know Termination greatly simplifies\n\
    \   audits to determine actual device configuration, and reduces the\n   number\
    \ of Terminations involved in representing user interface.\n   In addition, TerminationID\
    \ naming conventions are provided to\n   identify specific Terminations within\
    \ the Megaco IP Phone MG and\n   group them into related sets.  These conventions\
    \ use a set of well\n   known identifier names to specify the individual Terminations,\
    \ for\n   example the User Interface Termination (\"ui\"), the Handset Audio\n\
    \   Transducer (\"at/hs\"), or the Handsfree Audio Transducer (\"at/hf\").\n \
    \  This specific naming is important in this application, especially for\n   the\
    \ Audio Transducer Terminations, since the real input/output\n   elements to which\
    \ they map on the physical device have very different\n   functional significance\
    \ to the end-user, yet they may be represented\n   in the protocol using exactly\
    \ the same sets of Packages.  Naming\n   conventions allow the controlling MGC\
    \ to distinguish this end-user\n   meaning without specific advance knowledge\
    \ of physical device\n   configuration and without the requirement to provide\
    \ different\n   Packages for each audio input/output type.\n   Using these same\
    \ TerminationID naming conventions in combination with\n   wildcards, the MGC\
    \ application can target commands to groups of\n   related Terminations, for example\
    \ the collection of all Audio\n   Transducer Terminations (\"at/*\").  This is\
    \ especially useful during\n   the discover phase, for example to efficiently\
    \ Audit all available\n   Audio Transducer Terminations, and to efficiently send\
    \ commands to a\n   set of related Terminations in a single command, for example\
    \ to\n   simultaneously Subtract all Audio Transducer Terminations from a\n  \
    \ particular Context.  Further information on TerminationID naming\n   conventions\
    \ and their use can be found under the sections on Control\n   Interaction and\
    \ Capability Discovery (next two subsections) and under\n   Termination Types.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Control Interaction
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Control Interaction\n   To provide control of audio paths, Audio Transducer\
    \ Terminations are\n   manipulated using Contexts in the normal way, by sending\
    \ Add, Move,\n   Subtract and Modify commands addressed to the specific Terminations\n\
    \   being manipulated.  For example creating a Context (Context A)\n   containing\
    \ an RTP Termination (Tr) and a Handset Audio Transducer\n   Termination (Ta1)\
    \ creates a voice connection to/from the handset.\n   Moving a Handsfree Audio\
    \ Transducer Termination (Ta2) into the\n   Context, and removing the Handset,\
    \ sets up a handsfree conversation.\n   This situation is shown in Figure 1. \
    \ See the section on Audio\n   Transducer Termination Types for further details\
    \ on specific Package\n   support requirements.\n   User input elements, such\
    \ as Keypad or Function Keys, generate Events\n   through Notify commands sent\
    \ from the User Interface Termination of\n   the Megaco IP Phone MG to the controlling\
    \ MGC for handling.  These\n   Events are according to the specific set of Packages\
    \ supported by the\n   User Interface Termination of the device.  See the section\
    \ on User\n   Interface Termination Type for further details on specific Package\n\
    \   support requirements.\n   User output elements such as the Text Display or\
    \ Indicators are\n   controlled by Signals sent by the MGC, addressed to the User\n\
    \   Interface Termination of the Megaco IP Phone MG, generally as part of\n  \
    \ a Modify command, using syntax defined in the corresponding Packages.\n   Since\
    \ the User Interface Termination cannot be part of any context,\n   Add, Move\
    \ and Subtract commands sent to it are not valid.  See the\n   section on User\
    \ Interface Termination Type for further details on\n   specific Package support\
    \ requirements.\n   Some elements, for example Softkeys, have both user input\
    \ and output\n   aspects, so both react to Signals and generate Events as above.\n\
    \   The TerminationID naming conventions may be used to target commands\n   to\
    \ specific Terminations by well known name, for example to Add the\n   Handsfree\
    \ Audio Transducer Termination (\"at/hf\") to a Context.  The\n   naming conventions\
    \ in combination with wildcards may be used to\n   efficiently send commands to\
    \ groups of related Terminations, for\n   example to simultaneously Subtract all\
    \ Audio Transducer Terminations\n   (\"at/*\") from a particular Context.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Capability Discovery
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Capability Discovery\n   At startup or service change, the Megaco IP Phone\
    \ MG identifies\n   itself to its controlling MGC as being a Megaco IP Phone class\
    \ of\n   device by use of the IPPhone Protocol Profile.  This is the first and\n\
    \   most important stage of capability discovery, and implicitly provides\n  \
    \ a great deal of the necessary information in a single step.\n   Thereafter,\
    \ the MGC can make a large number of assumptions regarding\n   organization and\
    \ behavior of the MG.  See the section on IPPhone\n   Protocol Profile for further\
    \ details of ServiceChange operation.\n   Device capabilities, including the list\
    \ of all Terminations and\n   supported Packages for each, are queried through\
    \ the AuditValue\n   command.  Wildcarded AuditValue commands targeted at the\
    \ whole MG\n   (i.e., addressed to ContextID=Null, TerminationID=ALL) return the\n\
    \   list of all Terminations, including the User Interface Termination\n   and\
    \ all supported Audio Transducer Terminations.  Since the returned\n   TerminationIDs\
    \ use well known identifier names, the MGC can derive\n   the specific audio input/output\
    \ elements available on the physical\n   device, and their intended purpose. \
    \ Further AuditValues commands on\n   individual named Terminations provide further\
    \ details of each, for\n   example for the MGC to query user interface support\
    \ Packages\n   available on the User Interface Termination (\"ui\").  TerminationID\n\
    \   naming conventions in combination with wildcards can be used with\n   AuditValues\
    \ commands to query specific Package support for the\n   collection of all Audio\
    \ Transducer Terminations (\"at/*\").\n   Since the structure of the Megaco IP\
    \ Phone MG is well known in\n   advance, by virtue of the IPPhone Protocol Profile,\
    \ audits can be\n   efficiently directed at discovering only what additional information\n\
    \   is required by the MGC.  Thus the MGC is able to efficiently and\n   unambiguously\
    \ discover both the specific user interface capabilities\n   and the supported\
    \ audio input/outputs of the Megaco IP Phone MG,\n   without specific advance\
    \ knowledge of physical device configuration.\n   It is not necessary for the\
    \ MGC to attempt to infer function from\n   supported Packages within a random\
    \ collection of Terminations, and a\n   great deal of behavior common to all Megaco\
    \ IP Phone MGs can simply\n   be assumed.  This pre-determined organization and\
    \ behavior therefore\n   greatly reduces design complexity of both MG and MGC,\
    \ and greatly\n   improves interoperability.\n"

    \ *  Microphone (\"mi\") -- input only,\n      *  Speaker (\"sp\")    -- output\
    \ only.\n   TerminationIDs of the Audio Transducer Terminations MUST be of the\n\
    \   form \"at/<name>\", where <name> is the 2 character identifier listed\n  \
    \ above, used for both command addressing and command response return.\n   If\

    \ Examples of valid TerminationIDs\n   include: \"at/hs\" (handset), \"at/mi/02\"\
    \ (microphone 2), \"at/*\" (all\n   audio input/outputs).  ABNF text encoding\
    \ for this MUST be as\n   described in Megaco/H.248 Protocol Appendix B.1 [3].\n\

    \ TerminationIDs and wildcards MUST be encoded as\n   described in Megaco/H.248\
    \ Protocol Appendix A.1 [3], with alphabetic\n   characters of the identifiers\
    \ given above mapping to octet sub-\n   strings in the ASN.1 encoding and the\

- title: 6.  IPPhone Protocol Profile
  contents:
  - "6.  IPPhone Protocol Profile\n   The following subsections provide details of\
    \ the IPPhone Protocol\n   Profile, used between Megaco IP Phone MGs and their\
    \ controlling MGCs.\n   This includes implicit application-level agreements between\
    \ the\n   Megaco IP Phone MG and its controlling MGC on organization and\n   behavior\
    \ of the MG, types of Terminations used and the specific\n   minimum Package support\
    \ for each, and specific minimum selections on\n   the transport and encoding\
    \ methods used.\n   Use of a this Profile greatly simplifies assumptions necessary\
    \ by the\n   MGC regarding MG organization, thereby reducing complexity and cost\n\
    \   of both MG and MGC, and improves interoperability for the specific\n   Megaco\
    \ IP Phone application.  Since the Profile is specific to the\n   Megaco IP Phone\
    \ MG, no other applications of Megaco/H.248 Protocol\n   are affected.\n   It\
    \ is important to note that the IPPhone Profile specifies minimum\n   functionality\
    \ only, for interoperability purposes.  Additional\n   Termination types, Package\
    \ support, transport or encoding methods, or\n   other capabilities MAY be added\
    \ at the discretion of the implementer\n   within the general structure described.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.1.  Profile Descriptor and Usage\n   Profile name: \"IPPhone\"\n   Version:\
    \ 1\n   The Megaco/H.248 Protocol [3] describes startup and service change\n \
    \  procedures in detail, including use of Profiles.\n   In brief, the above Profile\
    \ name and version are supplied by the\n   Megaco IP Phone MG on startup or at\
    \ service change, in the\n   ServiceChangeDescriptor parameter of the ServiceChange\
    \ command,\n   issued to the controlling MGC as part of the registration procedure.\n\
    \   In response, the MGC may 1) accept control by acknowledging the\n   Service\
    \ Change, 2) pass control to a different MGC by replying with a\n   new MGC to\
    \ try, or 3) refuse control entirely by rejecting the\n   Service Change.  If\
    \ MGC control is refused, the Megaco IP Phone MG\n   may attempt registration\
    \ with other MGCs in its list of MGCs to try.\n   Once a controlling MGC accepts\
    \ the IPPhone Profile, both it and the\n   Megaco IP Phone MG become bound by\
    \ the Profile rules and constraints\n   described in subsequent subsections as\
    \ well as Megaco IP Phone\n   Termination/Package organization and behavior rules\
    \ described in\n   previous sections of this document.  Thereafter, any protocol\
    \ use\n   outside these rules is considered an error.\n"
