  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines an extension for expressing threaded\n
    \  discussions within the Atom Syndication Format [RFC4287].\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction

  - "2.  Notational Conventions\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
    14, [RFC2119], as\n   scoped to those conformance targets.\n   The XML Namespaces
    URI [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114] for the XML\n   elements and attributes described
    in this specification is:\n   http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0\n   In this
    document, the namespace prefix \"thr:\" is used for the above\n   Namespace URI.
    \ Note that the choice of namespace prefix is arbitrary\n   and not semantically
    significant.\n   This specification uses a shorthand form of terms from the XML\n
    \  Infoset [W3C.REC-xml-infoset-20040204].  The phrase \"Information\n   Item\"
    is omitted when naming Element and Attribute Information Items.\n   Therefore,
    when this specification uses the term \"element,\" it is\n   referring to an Element
    Information Item in Infoset terms.  Likewise,\n   when this specification uses
    the term \"attribute,\" it is referring to\n   an Attribute Information Item.\n
    \  This specification allows the use of IRIs [RFC3987].  Every URI\n   [RFC3986]
    is also an IRI, so a URI may be used wherever an IRI is\n   named.  When an IRI
    that is not also a URI is given for\n   dereferencing, it MUST be mapped to a
    URI using the steps in Section\n   3.1 of [RFC3987].  When an IRI is serving as
    an identifier, it MUST\n   NOT be so mapped.\n   Some sections of this specification
    are illustrated with a non-\n   normative RELAX NG Compact schema [RELAXNG].  In
    those sections, this\n   specification uses the atomCommonAttributes, atomMediaType,
    and\n   atomURI patterns, defined in [RFC4287].\n   However, the text of this
    specification provides the sole definition\n   of conformance.\n"

  - "3.  The 'in-reply-to' Extension Element\n   The \"in-reply-to\" element is used
    to indicate that an entry is a\n   response to another resource.  The element
    MUST contain a \"ref\"\n   attribute identifying the resource that is being responded
    to.\n   The element is not unlike the references and in-reply-to email\n   message
    headers, defined by [RFC2822].  However, unlike the in-\n   reply-to header, the
    \"in-reply-to\" element is required to identify\n   the unique identifier of only
    a single parent resource.  If the entry\n   is a response to multiple resources,
    additional \"in-reply-to\"\n   elements MAY be used.  There is no direct equivalent
    to the\n   references header, which lists the unique identifiers of each\n   preceding
    message in a thread.\n   in-reply-to =\n     element thr:in-reply-to {\n       atomCommonAttributes,\n
    \      ref,\n       href?,\n       source?,\n       type?,\n       ( undefinedContent
    )\n     }\n   ref = attribute ref { atomURI }\n   href = attribute href { atomURI
    }\n   type = attribute type { atomMediaType }\n   source = attribute source {
    atomURI }\n   The \"ref\" attribute specifies the persistent, universally unique\n
    \  identifier of the resource being responded to.  The value MUST\n   conform
    to the same construction and comparison rules as the value of\n   the atom:id
    element, as defined in Section 4.2.6 of [RFC4287].\n   Though the IRI might use
    a dereferenceable scheme, processors MUST\n   NOT assume that it can be dereferenced.\n
    \  If the resource being responded to does not have a persistent,\n   universally
    unique identifier, the publisher MUST assign an\n   identifier that satisfies
    all the considerations in Section 4.2.6 of\n   [RFC4287] for use as the value
    of the \"ref\" attribute.  In that case,\n   if a representation of the resource
    can be retrieved from an IRI that\n   can be used as a valid atom:id value, then
    this IRI SHOULD be used as\n   the value of both the \"ref\" and \"href\" attributes.\n
    \  The \"source\" attribute MAY be used to specify the IRI [RFC3987] of an\n   Atom
    Feed or Entry Document containing an atom:entry with an atom:id\n   value equal
    to the value of the \"ref\" attribute.  The IRI specified,\n   once appropriately
    mapped to a corresponding URI, MUST be\n   dereferenceable.\n   The \"href\" attribute
    specifies an IRI that may be used to retrieve a\n   representation of the resource
    being responded to.  The IRI\n   specified, once appropriately mapped to a corresponding
    URI, MUST be\n   dereferenceable.\n   The \"type\" attribute MAY be used to provide
    a hint to the client\n   about the media type [RFC4288] of the resource identified
    by the\n   \"href\" attribute.  The \"type\" attribute is only meaningful if a\n
    \  corresponding \"href\" attribute is also provided.\n   This specification assigns
    no significance to the order in which\n   multiple \"in-reply-to\" elements appear
    within an entry.\n   An example of an entry with a response follows:\n   <feed
    xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"\n         xmlns:thr=\"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0\">\n

    a response to the original entry</summary>\n     </entry>\n   </feed>\n   To allow
    Atom processors that are not familiar with the in-reply-to\n   extension to know
    that a relationship exists between the entry and\n   the resource being responded
    to, publishers are advised to consider\n   including a \"related\" link referencing
    a representation of the\n   resource identified by the in-reply-to element.  Although
    such links\n   are unlikely to be processed as a reference to a predecessor in
    a\n   threaded conversation, they are helpful in at least establishing a\n   semantically
    meaningful relationship between the linked resources.\n   For example,\n   <feed
    xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"\n         xmlns:thr=\"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0\">\n

  title: 3.  The 'in-reply-to' Extension Element
- contents:
  - "4.  The 'replies' Link Relation\n   An Atom link element with a rel attribute
    value of \"replies\" may be\n   used to reference a resource where responses to
    an entry may be\n   found.  If the type attribute of the atom:link is omitted,
    its value\n   is assumed to be \"application/atom+xml\".\n   A \"replies\" link
    appearing as a child of the Atom feed or source\n   element indicates that the
    referenced resource likely contains\n   responses to any of that feed's entries.
    \ A \"replies\" link appearing\n   as a child of an Atom entry element indicates
    that the linked\n   resource likely contains responses specific to that entry.\n
    \  An atom:link element using the \"replies\" rel attribute value MAY\n   contain
    a \"thr:count\" attribute whose value is an unsigned, non-\n   negative integer,
    conforming to the canonical representation of the\n   XML Schema nonNegativeInteger
    data type [W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-\n   20041028], that provides a hint to clients
    as to the total number of\n   replies contained by the linked resource.  The value
    is advisory and\n   may not accurately reflect the actual number of replies.\n
    \  The link MAY also contain a \"thr:updated\" attribute, whose value is a\n   [RFC3339]
    date-time stamp conforming to the same construction rules\n   as the Atom Date
    Construct defined in [RFC4287], and is used to\n   provide a hint to clients as
    to the date and time of the most\n   recently updated reply contained by the linked
    resource.  The value\n   is advisory and may not accurately reflect the actual
    date and time\n   of the most recent reply.\n   For example,\n   <feed xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"\n
    \        xmlns:thr=\"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0\">\n     <id>http://www.example.org/myfeed</id>\n
    \    <title>My Example Feed</title>\n     <updated>2005-07-28T12:00:00Z</updated>\n
    \    <link href=\"http://www.example.org/myfeed\" />\n     <author><name>James</name></author>\n
    \    <entry>\n       <id>tag:entries.com,2005:1</id>\n       <title>My original
    entry</title>\n       <updated>2006-03-01T12:12:12Z</updated>\n       <link href=\"http://www.example.org/entries/1\"
    />\n       <link rel=\"replies\"\n             type=\"application/atom+xml\"\n
    \            href=\"http://www.example.org/mycommentsfeed.xml\"\n             thr:count=\"10\"
    thr:updated=\"2005-07-28T12:10:00Z\" />\n       <summary>This is my original entry</summary>\n
    \    </entry>\n   </feed>\n   Although Atom feed, entry, and source elements MAY
    each contain any\n   number of atom:link elements using the \"replies\" link relation,
    this\n   specification assigns no significance to the presence or order of\n   such
    links.  Multiple replies links appearing within an atom:entry\n   may reference
    alternative representations of the same set of\n   responses or may reference
    entirely distinct resources containing\n   distinct sets of responses.  Processors
    MUST NOT assume that multiple\n   replies links are referencing different representations
    of the same\n   resource and MUST process each replies link independently of any\n
    \  others.\n"
  title: 4.  The 'replies' Link Relation
- contents:
  - "5.  The 'total' Extension Element\n   The \"total\" element is used to indicate
    the total number of unique\n   responses to an entry known to the publisher.  Its
    content MUST be an\n   unsigned non-negative integer value conforming to the canonical\n
    \  representation of the XML Schema nonNegativeInteger data type\n   [W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028].\n
    \     total = element thr:total { xsd:nonNegativeInteger }\n   Atom entries MAY
    contain a \"total\" element but MUST NOT contain more\n   than one.\n   There
    is no implied relationship between the value of the \"total\"\n   element of an
    Atom entry and any individual or aggregate values of\n   the \"thr:count\" attributes
    of its Atom link elements having a\n   \"replies\" relation.\n"
  title: 5.  The 'total' Extension Element
- contents:
  - "6.  Considerations for Using thr:count, thr:updated, and total\n   The thr:count,
    thr:updated, and total extensions provide additional\n   metadata about the thread
    of discussion associated with an entry.\n   The values are intended to make it
    easier for feed consumers to\n   display basic contextual information about the
    thread without\n   requiring that those consumers dereference, parse, and analyze
    linked\n   resources.  That said, there are a number of considerations\n   implementors
    need to be aware of.\n   First, these extensions MUST NOT be assumed to provide
    completely\n   accurate information about the thread of discussion.  For instance,\n
    \  the actual total number of responses contained by a linked resource\n   MAY
    differ from the number specified in the thr:count attribute.\n   Feed publishers
    SHOULD make an effort to ensure that the values are\n   accurate.  The non-authoritative
    nature of \"external reference\n   metadata\", like the replies link attributes,
    is discussed in detail\n   in Section 3.3 of the W3C document \"Tag Finding 12:
    \ Authoritative\n   Metadata\" [TAG12].\n   Second, the values of the these extensions
    are volatile and may\n   change at a faster rate than that of the containing entry.
    \ Frequent\n   updates to these values, or to any part of the Atom document, could\n
    \  have a detrimental impact on the cacheability of the document using\n   the
    attributes, leading to an increase in overall bandwidth\n   consumption.\n   Feed
    publishers SHOULD consider a change to the values of the thr:\n   count, thr:updated,
    and total extensions an \"insignificant\" update in\n   terms of [RFC4287], meaning
    that the value of the containing feed,\n   entry, or source element's atom:updated
    element SHOULD NOT be\n   affected by a change to the values of these extensions.\n
    \  Lastly, implementors need to be aware that although the Atom\n   specification
    [RFC4287] explicitly allows the link element to contain\n   arbitrary extensions,
    the specification does not require that\n   implementations support such extensions.
    \ Specifically, relating to\n   the use of extensions, Atom does not define any
    level of mandatory\n   conformance on the part of feed consumers beyond a requirement
    that\n   implementations ignore any extension the implementation does not\n   understand.
    \ As a result, some implementations MAY NOT be capable of\n   fully utilizing
    the extensions defined by this or any specification.\n"
  title: 6.  Considerations for Using thr:count, thr:updated, and total
- contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   As this specification defines an extension to
    the Atom Syndication\n   Format, it is subject to the same security considerations
    defined in\n   [RFC4287].\n   Feeds using the mechanisms described here could
    be crafted in such a\n   way as to cause a consumer to initiate excessive (or
    even an unending\n   sequence of) network requests, causing denial of service
    (to the\n   consumer, the target server, and/or intervening networks).  Consumers\n
    \  can mitigate this risk by requiring user intervention after a certain\n   number
    of requests, or by limiting requests either according to a\n   hard limit, or
    with heuristics.\n   The mechanisms described here can be used to construct threaded\n
    \  conversations spanning resources distributed across multiple domains.\n   For
    example, an individual posting an entry to one weblog hosted on\n   one Internet
    domain could mark that entry as a response to an entry\n   from a different weblog
    hosted on a different domain.  Implementors\n   should note that such distributed
    responses can be leveraged by an\n   attacker to attach inappropriate or unwanted
    content to a discussion.\n   Such attacks can be prevented or mitigated by allowing
    users to\n   explicitly configure the sources from which responses may be\n   retrieved,
    or by applying heuristics to determine the legitimacy of a\n   given response
    source.\n   Implementors should also note the potential for abuse that exists\n
    \  when malicious content publishers edit or change previously published\n   content.
    \ In closed, centralized comment systems, after-the-fact\n   editing of comments
    is typically not an issue, as such changes are\n   easily prevented, detected,
    or tracked.  With the form of distributed\n   comments enabled through the use
    of the thr:in-reply-to extension,\n   however, such changes become more difficult
    to detect, raising the\n   possibility of serious attribution and repudiation
    concerns.  XML\n   Digital Signatures, as specified in Section 5.1 of [RFC4287],
    present\n   one possible avenue for mitigating such concerns, although the\n   presence
    of a valid XML Digital Signature within an entry is not, by\n   itself, a reliable
    defense against repudiation issues.\n"
  title: 7.  Security Considerations

  - "8.  IANA Considerations\n   This specification defines one new Atom link relation
    type that has\n   been registered in the IANA Registry of Link Relation, as defined

    4)\n      Expected display characteristics: (see Section 4)\n      Security considerations:
