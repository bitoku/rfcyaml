    \ responsible\n   for managing the operations of network resources.  This document\n\

    \ mechanism for a manager to suppress or defer the reporting of alarm\n   conditions\

- title: 4.  ARC MIB Overview
  contents:
  - "4.  ARC MIB Overview\n   There is a need to provide a mechanism for controlling\
    \ the reporting\n   of alarm conditions of resources in a network device.  For\
    \ example,\n   (a) inhibiting the reporting of alarm conditions of a resource\
    \ until\n   the resource is problem-free, (b) inhibiting the reporting of alarm\n\
    \   conditions of a resource for a specified time period, or (c)\n   inhibiting\
    \ the reporting of alarm conditions of a resource\n   indefinitely until explicitly\
    \ allowed by the managing system at a\n   later time.\n   The alarm reporting\
    \ control (ARC) feature provides an automatic in-\n   service provisioning capability.\
    \  It allows sufficient time for\n   service setup, customer testing, and other\
    \ maintenance activities in\n   an \"alarm-free\" state.  Once a resource is \"\
    problem-free\", alarm\n   reporting can be automatically or manually turned on\
    \ (i.e., allowed).\n   By putting a network resource in ARC mode, (i.e., in nalm,\
    \ nalmTI,\n   nalmQI, or nalmQICD states, as described in the MIB), the technicians\n\
    \   and managing systems will not be flooded with unnecessary work items\n   during\
    \ operations activities such as service provisioning and network\n   setup/teardown.\
    \  This will reduce maintenance costs and improve the\n   operation and maintenance\
    \ of these systems.  Putting a network\n   resource in ARC mode shall not affect\
    \ the availability of active\n   alarm condition information for potential retrieval.\n\
    \   ITU-T Recommendation M.3100 Amendment 3 [M.3100 Amd3] provides the\n   business\
    \ requirements, analysis, and design of the Alarm Reporting\n   Control feature.\n\
    \   This document defines the MIB objects to support a subset of the ARC\n   functions\
    \ described in M.3100 Amd3.  In particular, it defines a\n   table that can be\
    \ used to specify the ARC settings for the resources\n   in a system.\n   Defined\
    \ in M.3100 Amendment 3 [M.3100 Amd3], there are five ARC\n   states: alm, nalm,\
    \ nalmQI, nalmQICD and nalmTI.  In the ARC MIB\n   module, the arcState object\
    \ is defined to model the M.3100 ARC\n   states. Note that the state alm (alarm\
    \ reporting is allowed) is not\n   listed in the enumeration of the value of this\
    \ object.  However, this\n   state is implicitly supported by the mib.  Once a\
    \ resource enters the\n   normal reporting mode (i.e., into the alm state) for\
    \ the specified\n   alarm type, the corresponding row will be automatically deleted\
    \ from\n   the arc table.  Also the manual setting of arcState to alm can be\n\
    \   achieved through setting the RowStatus object to 'destroy'.\n   The ARC MIB\
    \ module defined in this document provides a way to control\n   the reporting\
    \ of alarm conditions.  A set of applicable alarm\n   conditions is defined in\
    \ ITU-T Recommendation M.3100 [M.3100] and is\n   named \"probable causes\". \
    \ These probable causes (alarm conditions)\n   have been included in the IANAItuProbableCause\
    \ TC, which is defined\n   in the IANA-ITU-ALARM-TC MIB module [RFC3877].  The\
    \ IANA-ITU-ALARM-TC\n   MIB module is maintained in the IANA web-site [ITUALARMTC].\n\
    \   [RFC3877].\n   The ARC MIB module defines an IANAItuProbableCauseOrZero TC\
    \ which can\n   take any value of IANAItuProbableCause or 0.  The ARC MIB module\n\
    \   further uses IANAItuProbableCauseOrZero to define the ARC settings\n   for\
    \ the managed resource in the network elements.  Specification of\n   objects\
    \ for defining and storing alarms, including active and history\n   alarms, standing\
    \ and transient alarms, and alarm notifications are\n   out of the scope of this\
    \ document.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Relationship between ARC mode and alarm reporting
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Relationship between ARC mode and alarm reporting\n   When the ARC MIB\
    \ module is used in a managed system, the following\n   rules apply:\n   For alarm\
    \ condition raised prior to entering ARC mode, reporting of\n   alarm raised and\
    \ alarm cleared will be sent as usual.\n   For alarm condition raised after entering\
    \ ARC mode and also cleared\n   before exiting ARC mode, no reporting of alarm\
    \ raised will be sent\n   and no reporting of alarm cleared will be sent.\n  \
    \ For alarm condition raised after entering ARC mode and not cleared\n   when\
    \ exiting ARC mode, the reporting of alarm raised will be deferred\n   until the\
    \ moment of exiting ARC mode.  The reporting of alarm cleared\n   will be sent\
    \ as usual (i.e., at the time of alarm cleared).\n   Further details of the ARC\
    \ function can be found in M.3100 Amd3\n   [M.3100 Amd3].\n"

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.\
    \  Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n\
    \   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment\
    \ without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.\
    \  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n\
    \      arcTITimeInterval,\n      arcCDTimeInterval,\n      arcState,\n      arcNalmTimeRemaining,\n\
    \      arcRowStatus,\n      arcStorageType.\n   Setting these objects may have\
    \ disruptive effects on network\n   operation that range from omission of alarm\
    \ notifications to flooding\n   of unwanted alarm notifications from the network.\
    \  The consequence of\n   suppressing or deferring the reporting of an alarm can\
    \ prevent the\n   timely delivery of important diagnostic information, including\n\
    \   information that can help identify an attack.\n   Some of the readable objects\
    \ in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible)\
    \ may be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.\
    \  It is thus important to\n   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these\
    \ objects and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending\
    \ them over\n   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their\n\
    \   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n      arcTITimeInterval,\n      arcCDTimeInterval,\n\
    \      arcState,\n      arcNalmTimeRemaining,\n      arcRowStatus,\n      arcStorageType.\n\
    \   Reading these objects will provide information about the setting\n   which\
    \ affects alarm notification generation.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did\
    \ not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for\
    \ example by using IPSec),\n   there is no control as to who on the secure network\
    \ is allowed to\n   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\
    \ in this\n   MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the\
    \ security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section\
    \ 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for\n\
    \   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior\
    \ to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3\
    \ and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n\
    \   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance\
    \ of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects\
    \ only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET\
    \ or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"
