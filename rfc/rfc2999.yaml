    \ Service allows applications to identify themselves to network\nQuality of Service\
    \ (QoS) policy agents, using RSVP signaling.  However,\nit does not require them\

    \ (ECMP) is a routing technique for routing packets\nalong multiple paths of equal\
    \ cost.  The forwarding engine identifies\npaths by next-hop.  When forwarding\
    \ a packet the router must decide\nwhich next-hop (path) to use.  This document\
