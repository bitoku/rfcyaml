  - "1.  Introduction\n   Since the late 1980s, participants in IEEE 802 and the IETF\
    \ have\n   cooperated in the development of Management Information Bases (MIBs)\n\
    \   and Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) applications\n   relating\
    \ to IEEE standards.  This has included the Bridge MIB\n   [RFC1493] [RFC4188],\
    \ the multicast filtering and VLAN extension MIB\n   [RFC2674] [RFC4363], the\
    \ Hub MIB [RFC2108], the Ethernet-like\n   Interfaces MIB [RFC3635], the MAU MIB\
    \ [RFC3636], the WAN Interfaces\n   Sublayer MIB [RFC3637], the Power Ethernet\
    \ MIB [RFC3621], IEEE 802.1X\n   RADIUS usage guidelines [RFC3580], the revised\
    \ Extensible\n   Authentication Protocol (EAP) specification [RFC3748], RADIUS/EAP\n\
    \   [RFC3579], and the EAP State Machine specification [RFC4137].  This\n   document\
    \ describes the policies and procedures that have been put in\n   place to encourage\
    \ cooperation between the IETF and IEEE 802.\n   Details of the relationship history\
    \ are included in Appendix A.\n   In order to improve communications between the\
    \ IETF and IEEE 802,\n   members of the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG)\
    \ and\n   Internet Architecture Board (IAB) (including Bert Wijnen, James\n  \
    \ Kempf, and Bernard Aboba) met with the IEEE 802 Executive Committee\n   in Vancouver,\
    \ Canada, in January 2004.  At that meeting, a number of\n   issues were discussed\
    \ and new procedures were put in place.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Liaison Communications
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Liaison Communications\n   IETF Working Groups are organized into areas,\
    \ which have one or more\n   Area Directors.  The Area Directors, plus the IETF\
    \ Chair, comprise\n   the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG).  IEEE 802\
    \ Working\n   Groups have one or more Task Groups.  The IEEE 802 Working Group\n\
    \   Chairs, plus the IEEE 802 Chair, comprise the IEEE 802 Executive\n   Committee\
    \ (ExComm).\n   Participants in the IETF are appointed as liaisons to other\n\
    \   organizations by the IAB or IESG as appropriate.  This includes a\n   liaison\
    \ to IEEE 802 as well as liaisons to specific IEEE 802 Working\n   Groups.  The\
    \ IETF liaison web page includes a list of IETF liaisons,\n   as well as a pointer\
    \ to the archive of liaison statements received by\n   the IETF [Liaison-Page].\
    \  IETF processes for management of liaison\n   relationships are described in\
    \ [BCP102]; procedures for handling of\n   incoming liaison statements are described\
    \ in [BCP103].  In order to\n   ensure that liaison statements from IEEE 802 to\
    \ the IETF are archived\n   and responded to, IEEE 802 liaisons to IETF should\
    \ utilize the IETF\n   liaison management tool to submit liaison communications.\
    \  A username\n   and password suitable for use with the tool can be obtained\
    \ by\n   sending mail to iesg-secretary@ietf.org.  If a liaison management\n \
    \  account is not available, liaison communications can be sent to the\n   IETF\
    \ liaison(s) to IEEE 802 and copied to statements@ietf.org.\n   However, in this\
    \ case substantially greater processing delays will\n   occur due to the need\
    \ for manual handling by the IETF Secretariat\n   staff.\n   Liaison requests\
    \ from the IETF to IEEE 802 should be sent to the\n   Chair(s) of the IEEE 802\
    \ WG to which the request pertains, with a\n   copy sent to the IEEE 802 Chair\
    \ and the IEEE 802 liaison(s) to IETF.\n   IEEE 802 procedures for communicating\
    \ with other standards bodies are\n   described in Section 14.1 of [Policy]. \
    \ Liaison communications to\n   IEEE 802 WGs are archived by the individual WGs.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Access to IEEE 802 Archives
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Access to IEEE 802 Archives\n   Access to IEEE 802 standards more than\
    \ six months old is provided\n   free of charge on the IEEE 802 website via the\
    \ Get IEEE 802 Program\n   [GetIEEE-802].  Access to IEEE 802 work-in-progress\
    \ has frequently\n   arisen as an issue in cooperation between IETF and IEEE 802.\
    \  While\n   in the past IETF Working Groups (WGs) have successfully negotiated\n\
    \   access to IEEE 802 work-in-progress, each instance has been handled\n   separately\
    \ and took significant time and effort to complete.  In\n   order to more easily\
    \ enable document access for IETF WGs\n   collaborating with IEEE 802, a liaison\
    \ statement was sent to the IETF\n   in July 2004 by Paul Nikolich, Chair of IEEE\
    \ 802 [IEEE-802Liaison],\n   describing the process by which IETF WGs can obtain\
    \ access to IEEE\n   802 work-in-progress.  IEEE 802 WG Chairs have the authority\
    \ to grant\n   membership in their WGs, and can use this authority to grant\n\
    \   membership to an IETF WG chair upon request.  The IETF WG chair will\n   be\
    \ provided with access to the username/password for the IEEE 802 WG\n   archives,\
    \ and is permitted to share that information with\n   participants in the IETF\
    \ WG.  Since it is possible to participate in\n   IETF without attending meetings,\
    \ or even joining a mailing list, IETF\n   WG chairs will provide the information\
    \ to anyone who requests it.\n   However, since IEEE 802 work-in-progress is copyrighted,\n\
    \   incorporating material into IETF documents or posting the\n   username/password\
    \ on mailing lists or websites is not permitted.\n"
- title: 1.3.  New Work Review
  contents:
  - "1.3.  New Work Review\n   In order to enable IEEE 802 review of proposed IETF\
    \ WG charters, as\n   well as to enable IETF review of proposed IEEE 802 Project\n\
    \   Authorization Requests (PARs), the New Work mailing list is used.\n   The\
    \ IEEE 802 Executive Committee is subscribed to the list, so that\n   it can receive\
    \ proposed IETF WG Charters.  Proposed IEEE 802 PARs are\n   posted to the New\
    \ Work list as well.  Where a New Work announcement\n   is of particular interest,\
    \ it is also (manually) forwarded to the\n   relevant IETF and IEEE 802 mailing\
    \ lists.\n   However, by the time an IETF WG Charter or IEEE 802 PAR appears on\n\
    \   New Work, a IETF BOF or IEEE 802 \"Call for Interest\" has already\n   occurred,\
    \ interest has been demonstrated and considerable work has\n   gone into development\
    \ of the Charter or PAR.  If problems are found\n   at that point, it is often\
    \ too late in the process to make major\n   changes.  Therefore, where a potential\
    \ work item is likely to be\n   controversial, discussions between IETF and IEEE\
    \ 802 are encouraged\n   to occur earlier in the process.\n"
- title: 1.4.  MIB Review
  contents:
  - "1.4.  MIB Review\n   With travel budgets under pressure, it has become increasingly\n\
    \   difficult for companies to fund employees to attend both IEEE 802 and\n  \
    \ IETF meetings.  As a result, an alternative is needed to past\n   arrangements\
    \ that involved chartering MIB work items within an IETF\n   WG.  In order to\
    \ encourage wider review of MIBs developed by IEEE 802\n   WGs, it is recommended\
    \ that Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)\n   MIBs developed in IEEE 802\
    \ follow the MIB guidelines [RFC4181] and be\n   reviewed as part of the IETF\
    \ SNMP quality control process ('MIB\n   Doctors').  An IEEE 802 group may request\
    \ assignment of a 'MIB\n   Doctor' to assist in a MIB review by contacting the\
    \ IETF Operations\n   and Management Area Director.\n   By standardizing IEEE\
    \ 802 MIBs only within IEEE 802 while utilizing\n   the SNMP quality control process,\
    \ the IETF and IEEE 802 seek to\n   ensure quality while decreasing overhead.\
    \  A trial run of this\n   process has taken place in IEEE 802.1 where a MIB Doctor\
    \ (David\n   Harrington) has agreed to review IEEE 802.1 MIBs.  Currently,\n \
    \  discussion is under way on how change control of selected IEEE 802.1\n   MIB\
    \ documents published as RFCs can be transferred to IEEE 802.1\n   [MIB-TRANSFER].\n"
- title: 1.5.  EAP Review
  contents:
  - "1.5.  EAP Review\n   Several IEEE 802 standards, including [IEEE-802.1X-2004],\n\
    \   [IEEE-802.11i], and [IEEE-802.16e], depend on EAP [RFC3748] and EAP\n   key\
    \ management, described in [KEYFRAME].  Rather than developing\n   their own EAP\
    \ methods, or extensions for EAP key management, IEEE 802\n   working groups should\
    \ send a liaison letter to the IETF, outlining\n   the required functionality\
    \ or requesting a review of draft text.\n   Most recently, a security review of\
    \ IEEE 802.16e D8 [EAPREVIEW] has\n   been carried out by the EAP WG, at the request\
    \ of the IEEE 802.16\n   Chair, Roger Marks [IEEE-802.16-Liaison1] [IEEE-802.16-Liaison2].\n"
- title: 1.6.  AAA Review
  contents:
  - "1.6.  AAA Review\n   IEEE 802 WGs requiring new AAA applications should send\
    \ a liaison\n   request to the IETF.  Where new attributes are required rather\
    \ than a\n   new application, an Internet-Draft can be submitted and review can\n\
    \   be requested from AAA-related WGs such as the AAA or RADEXT WGs.  For\n  \
    \ attributes of general utility, and particularly those useful in\n   multiple\
    \ potential applications, allocation from the IETF standard\n   attribute space\
    \ is preferred to creation of IEEE 802 Vendor-Specific\n   Attributes (VSAs).\
    \  As noted in [RFC3575]:\n   RADIUS defines a mechanism for Vendor-Specific extensions\
    \ (Attribute\n   26) and the use of that should be encouraged instead of allocation\
    \ of\n   global attribute types, for functions specific only to one vendor's\n\
    \   implementation of RADIUS, where no interoperability is deemed useful.\n  \
    \ Where allocation of VSAs are required, it is recommended that IEEE\n   802 create\
    \ a uniform format for all of IEEE 802, rather than having\n   each IEEE 802 group\
    \ create their own VSA format.  The VSA format\n   defined in [IEEE-802.11F] is\
    \ inappropriate for this, since the Type\n   field is only a single octet, allowing\
    \ for only 255 attributes.\n   Recently, the AAA Doctors list has been created\
    \ within the IETF\n   Operations and Management Area Directorate, serving a similar\n\
    \   function to the MIB Doctors.  While the AAA Doctors have not yet been\n  \
    \ called upon to assist with and review AAA work outside of the IETF,\n   this\
    \ group could potentially be of assistance to IEEE 802 working\n   groups requiring\
    \ help with AAA.\n"
- title: 1.7.  Document Review
  contents:
  - "1.7.  Document Review\n   With the areas of cooperation between IEEE 802 and\
    \ IETF increasing,\n   the document review process has extended beyond the traditional\n\
    \   subjects of SNMP MIBs and AAA.  For example, as part of the IETF\n   CAPWAP\
    \ WG charter, IEEE 802.11 was asked to review the CAPWAP\n   Taxonomy Document\
    \ [RFC4118]; Dorothy Stanley organized an ad hoc\n   group for this purpose. \
    \ IEEE 802.11 has also reviewed [IDSEL] and\n   [IABLINK].  Within IETF, IEEE\
    \ 802 comments are resolved using normal\n   WG and IETF processes.\n   IETF participants\
    \ can comment as part of the IEEE 802 ballot process,\n   regardless of their\
    \ voting status within IEEE 802.  Comments must be\n   composed in the format\
    \ specified for the ballot, and submitted by the\n   ballot deadline.\n"
- title: 1.8.  EtherType Allocation
  contents:
  - "1.8.  EtherType Allocation\n   The EtherType field is very limited, so that allocations\
    \ are made\n   solely on an \"as needed\" basis.  For related uses, a single EtherType\n\
    \   should be requested, with additional fields serving as sub-protocol\n   identifiers,\
    \ rather than applying for multiple EtherTypes.  EtherType\n   allocation policy\
    \ is described in [TYPE-TUT].\n   While a fee is normally charged by IEEE 802\
    \ for the allocation of an\n   EtherType, IEEE 802 will consider waiving the fee\
    \ for allocations\n   relating to an IETF standards track document, based on a\
    \ request from\n   the IESG.\n"
- title: 2.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  Security Considerations\n   As IEEE 802 becomes increasingly involved in\
    \ the specification of\n   standards for link-layer security, experience has shown\
    \ that it is\n   helpful to obtain outside review of work-in-progress prior to\n\
    \   publication.  This has proven somewhat challenging since access to\n   IEEE\
    \ 802 work-in-progress documents is often tightly controlled.  For\n   example,\
    \ special permission had to be obtained for IEEE 802.11i to be\n   able to circulate\
    \ a version of its security standard-in-progress for\n   review.  A liaison between\
    \ an IEEE 802 group and an IETF WG can help\n   in obtaining the necessary level\
    \ of review.\n   Experience has also shown that IETF standards may not be written\
    \ to\n   the level of clarity required by the IEEE 802 standards process.  In\n\
    \   the case of EAP [RFC3748], the process of developing the EAP state\n   machine\
    \ specification [RFC4137] proved useful in uncovering aspects\n   requiring clarification,\
    \ and the joint review process exposed IEEE\n   802 and IETF documents-in-progress\
    \ to wider review than might\n   otherwise have been possible.\n   Similarly,\
    \ the development of [IEEE-802.11i], [RFC3748], [KEYFRAME],\n   and [RFC4017]\
    \ led to a deeper understanding of the limitations and\n   security vulnerabilities\
    \ of the EAP/AAA system.  As described in\n   [Housley], it is not advisable to\
    \ develop new AAA key management\n   applications without completing a security\
    \ analysis, such as the\n   analysis provided in [KEYFRAME].\n   Due to weaknesses\
    \ in the RADIUS specification [RFC2865], it is\n   relatively easy for protocol\
    \ extensions to introduce serious security\n   vulnerabilities.  As a result,\
    \ IETF review of IEEE 802 RADIUS\n   extensions is advisable, and the RADIUS IANA\
    \ Considerations [RFC3575]\n   have been revised so as to require such a review\
    \ in most cases.\n"

- title: A.1.1.  Bridge MIB
  contents:
  - "A.1.1.  Bridge MIB\n   The relationship between IETF and IEEE 802 began in the\
    \ late 1980s\n   with SNMP MIBs developed for the original IEEE 802.1D standard.\n\
    \   Because the IEEE specification [IEEE-802.1D] contained only a\n   functional\
    \ definition of the counters and operations, the IETF's\n   Bridge MIB WG took\
    \ on the role of defining the Bridge MIB [RFC1493],\n   which was published as\
    \ an RFC.  Fred Baker and later Keith McCloghrie\n   served as chairs of the Bridge\
    \ WG.\n   The Bridge MIB combined the work of Keith McCloghrie, Eric Decker,\n\
    \   and Paul Langille, with spanning tree expertise provided by Anil\n   Rijsinghani.\
    \  Mick Seaman (author of 802.1D) and Floyd Backes (who\n   had written the code\
    \ for Digital Equipment's spanning tree\n   implementation) were the main contacts\
    \ within IEEE 802.1.  Since\n   Mick, Floyd, Anil, and Paul all worked for Digital\
    \ Equipment\n   Corporation at the time, much of the coordination between IEEE\
    \ 802.1\n   and the Bridge MIB WG took place in the hallways at Digital, rather\n\
    \   than within official channels.\n"
- title: A.1.2.  MAU and Hub MIBs
  contents:
  - "A.1.2.  MAU and Hub MIBs\n   In the early 1990s when IEEE 802.3 was completing\
    \ the first Ethernet\n   standards, SNMP was not yet the dominant network management\
    \ protocol.\n   As a result, a 'protocol independent' MIB is included in Clause\
    \ 30 of\n   the IEEE 802.3 standard [IEEE-802.3], which is updated each time the\n\
    \   Ethernet standard is enhanced to support higher speeds.  In parallel,\n  \
    \ IEEE 802 participants interested in network management were active in\n   the\
    \ formation of the IETF HUBMIB WG, which took on the task of\n   transforming\
    \ IEEE 802 definitions into SNMP MIBs documented as\n   Standards Track RFCs.\
    \  This included Dan Romascanu, Chair of the IETF\n   HUBMIB WG since 1996.\n\
    \   The Charter of the HUBMIB WG explicitly mentions that the IEEE 802.3\n   standard\
    \ is the starting point for the Ethernet MIB, but at the same\n   time reserves\
    \ the right to deviate from the IEEE model -- either to\n   cover only part of\
    \ the capabilities offered by the standard or to add\n   MIB objects that are\
    \ not directly derived from the IEEE model (mostly\n   implemented in software).\
    \  If management needs lead to requirements\n   for hardware support, the IETF\
    \ HUBMIB WG is to provide this input to\n   IEEE 802.3 in a timely manner.\n \
    \  Cooperation between the IETF HUBMIB WG and IEEE 802.3 has continued\n   for\
    \ more than a decade until today, mostly based on the work of a few\n   editors\
    \ supported by their companies, who are taking the IEEE\n   standards and mapping\
    \ them into a management data model and MIBs.\n   Work items include:\n   - The\
    \ Hub MIB [RFC2108], which has gone through three iterations,\n     and is probably\
    \ ending its evolution, as repeaters are less used\n     in Ethernets.\n   - The\
    \ MAU MIB, which has been updated each time a new Ethernet speed\n     is developed,\
    \ with [RFC3636] accommodating 10-Gbps Ethernet.\n   - The Ethernet-like Interfaces\
    \ MIB was not originally a work item\n     of the HUBMIB WG, but the WG took responsibility\
    \ for a revision,\n     published as [RFC3635].\n   - The WAN Interface Sublayer\
    \ MIB [RFC3637] and the Power Ethernet MIB\n     [RFC3621] were developed in IEEE\
    \ 802.3 and the IETF HUBMIB WG.\n   In 2000, an official liaison was established\
    \ between IEEE 802.3 and\n   the IETF HUBMIB WG, and Dan Romascanu was appointed\
    \ IETF liaison.\n   The conditions of the liaison agreement allows editors and\
    \ other\n   participants in the IETF HUBMIB WG access to work-in-progress drafts\n\
    \   in IEEE 802.3 on a personal basis, for the purpose of working on MIBs\n  \
    \ before the release of the standard.  However, the username and\n   password\
    \ for IEEE 802.3 document access are not for publication on\n   any IETF website\
    \ or mailing list.\n"
- title: A.1.3.  802.1p/Q MIB
  contents:
  - "A.1.3.  802.1p/Q MIB\n   In 1996 as the 802.1p and 802.1Q [IEEE-802.1Q] standards\
    \ were being\n   completed, a need was perceived for development of an SNMP MIB,\
    \ based\n   on the management clauses of those standards.  IEEE 802 management\n\
    \   clauses are written in a manner that was independent of any protocol\n   that\
    \ may be used to implement them.\n   At that time, there were a number of proprietary\
    \ VLAN management MIBs\n   that were both inadequate and difficult to understand.\
    \  As a result,\n   there was a need for a more comprehensive, simpler model for\
    \ VLAN\n   management, along with the priority and multicast filtering\n   management\
    \ also defined by these standards.\n   A small group of participants from the\
    \ 802.1 WG began working on the\n   problem independently, then combined their\
    \ work.  The original\n   authors of the Bridge MIB, on which some of the work\
    \ was based,\n   reviewed the initial work.\n   By the end of 1997, the work was\
    \ ready for review by a larger\n   audience.  Andrew Smith worked with Keith McCloghrie,\
    \ chair of the\n   Bridge MIB WG (dormant at the time), to obtain a meeting slot\
    \ at the\n   March 1998 IETF meeting.  After this, review and development of the\n\
    \   MIB continued on the IETF standards track.\n   During the development of [RFC2674],\
    \ there was no official inter-\n   working between the IETF Bridge MIB and IEEE\
    \ 802.1 groups.\n   Development of this MIB was successful, because the main developers\n\
    \   (Andrew Smith and Les Bell) were involved in both the IEEE 802.1 and\n   the\
    \ IETF Bridge MIB WGs.\n"
- title: A.1.4.  802.3ad and 802.1X MIBs
  contents:
  - "A.1.4.  802.3ad and 802.1X MIBs\n   As part of the IEEE 802.3ad and IEEE 802.1X\
    \ standards work, it was\n   decided that it would be better to develop a MIB\
    \ as part of the\n   standards, rather than wait until an IETF WG was formed,\
    \ and develop\n   the MIBs separately, so as to avoid a significant time lag in\
    \ their\n   development.\n   As Les Bell was the participant in IEEE 802.3ad and\
    \ IEEE 802.1 most\n   familiar with SNMP MIB development, he put together the\
    \ initial MIBs\n   based on the management framework the groups had come up with.\n\
    \   Additional assistance was then received for both MIBs from within the\n  \
    \ IEEE 802.3ad and IEEE 802.1X groups.  Tony Jeffree, editor of both\n   standards,\
    \ acted as editor of the MIBs as well.\n   The problem with IEEE 802 developing\
    \ these MIBs without IETF\n   involvement was the lack of review.  IEEE 802 members\
    \ are generally\n   not familiar with MIBs, and very few comments were received\
    \ as part\n   of the balloting process for either MIB.\n   In the case of the\
    \ IEEE 802.3ad MIB, this meant that basic errors\n   were not discovered until\
    \ just before publication.  Unfortunately, by\n   then it was too late, and the\
    \ corrections submitted to the IEEE\n   802.3ad chair and document editor did\
    \ not get applied to the\n   published version.\n   Subsequent to the publication\
    \ of [IEEE-802.1X], the IEEE 802.1X MIB\n   was reviewed within the Bridge WG,\
    \ and several syntax errors were\n   found.  These have been corrected in the\
    \ version of the MIB module\n   that was developed as part of [IEEE-802.1X-2004].\
    \  However, while\n   [IEEE-802.1X-MIB] was originally published as a work in\
    \ progress\n   within the Bridge WG, there was not sufficient interest to complete\n\
    \   its publication as an RFC.  As a result, the draft has now expired.\n"
- title: A.1.5.  802.1t, 802.1u, 802.1v, and 802.1w MIBs
  contents:
  - "A.1.5.  802.1t, 802.1u, 802.1v, and 802.1w MIBs\n   802.1t and 802.1u were minor\
    \ amendments to the 802.1D and 802.1Q\n   standards, requiring some additions\
    \ to the MIB published in\n   [RFC2674].  802.1v was a new feature extending the\
    \ VLAN\n   classification schemes of 802.1Q, also requiring extensions to\n  \
    \ [RFC2674].  802.1w was a new version of Spanning Tree, requiring\n   rewriting\
    \ of part of [RFC1493].\n   When Les Bell took on the role of Chair of the IETF\
    \ Bridge MIB WG in\n   2001, these issues were raised as new work items and two\
    \ volunteers\n   were found to become editors of the Internet-Drafts.  A work\
    \ item was\n   also included to publish the IEEE 802.1X MIB as an Informational\
    \ RFC.\n   This approach worked well for a while, but it then became difficult\n\
    \   for the participants, including the editors and the Chair, to sustain\n  \
    \ a level of interest sufficient to overcome the difficulties\n   introduced by\
    \ budget cutbacks.  As a result, the drafts have now\n   expired, although there\
    \ are no significant technical issues\n   outstanding.\n"
- title: A.2.  AAA/EAP
  contents:
  - "A.2.  AAA/EAP\n   Since the late 1990s, IEEE 802.1 has been involved in work\
    \ relating\n   to authentication and authorization [IEEE-802.1X], which led to\n\
    \   discovery of issues in several IETF specifications, including\n   [RFC2284]\
    \ and [RFC2869].  Similarly, IETF participants have uncovered\n   issues in early\
    \ versions of the RADIUS usage specifications such as\n   [RFC3580], as well as\
    \ the IEEE 802.1X state machine [Mishra].\n   In order to address these issues\
    \ and ensure synchronization between\n   IEEE 802.1 and the IETF EAP and AAA WGs,\
    \ a liaison arrangement was\n   utilized during the development of [IEEE-802.1X]\
    \ and\n   [IEEE-802.1X-2004].\n   IEEE 802.11 groups such as IEEE 802.11i and\
    \ IEEE 802.11F have also\n   become dependent on EAP and AAA work.  This relationship\
    \ was more\n   challenging since IEEE 802.11 required development of EAP methods\
    \ and\n   the EAP Key Management Framework, which represented substantial new\n\

- title: A.2.1.  IEEE 802.1X
  contents:
  - "A.2.1.  IEEE 802.1X\n   IEEE 802.1X-2001 [IEEE-802.1X] defined the encapsulation\
    \ of EAP\n   [RFC2284] over IEEE 802, as well as a state machine for the joint\n\
    \   operation of IEEE 802.1X and EAP.\n   During the development of IEEE 802.1X-2001,\
    \ several problems were\n   discovered in the specification for RADIUS/EAP [RFC2869],\
    \ and as a\n   result, work was begun on a revision [RFC3579].  In addition,\n\
    \   clarifications were required on how RADIUS attributes defined in\n   [RFC2865],\
    \ [RFC2866], [RFC2867], [RFC2868], [RFC2869], and [RFC3162]\n   would be interpreted\
    \ by IEEE 802.1X implementations.  To address\n   this, a non-normative RADIUS\
    \ usage appendix was added to\n   [IEEE-802.1X], and published as [RFC3580].\n\
    \   Subsequent to the publication of [IEEE-802.1X], a formal analysis of\n   the\
    \ IEEE 802.1X state machine by the University of Maryland disclosed\n   several\
    \ security issues [Mishra].  Discussion within IEEE 802.1\n   pointed to lack\
    \ of clarity in [RFC2284], which resulted from the\n   absence of a specification\
    \ for the EAP state machine specification.\n   At that time, EAP was handled within\
    \ the IETF PPPEXT WG, which was\n   largely inactive.  In order to undertake work\
    \ on a revised EAP\n   specification as well as the specification of the EAP state\
    \ machine,\n   the IETF EAP WG was formed in July 2002.  Bernard Aboba, a\n  \
    \ participant in IEEE 802.1 as well as PPPEXT, was named co-chair.\n   Work on\
    \ the EAP state machine [RFC4137] and revised EAP specification\n   [RFC3748]\
    \ proceeded in parallel within the EAP WG, with issues or\n   changes in one document\
    \ requiring changes to the other document, as\n   well as revisions to [IEEE-802.1X-2004].\
    \  The revised RADIUS/EAP\n   specification [RFC3579] was also reviewed within\
    \ the EAP WG, since at\n   that time the RADEXT WG had not yet been formed.\n\
    \   The revision to IEEE 802.1X [IEEE-802.1X-2004] included the\n   following:\n\
    \   - a revised RADIUS usage appendix based on [RFC3580]\n   - clarifications\
    \ based on [RFC3579]\n   - a revised IEEE 802.1X state machine, based on [RFC3748]\
    \ and\n     [RFC4137]\n   Due to the deep dependencies between [IEEE-802.1X-2004],\
    \ [RFC3748],\n   and [RFC4137], a liaison was established between IEEE 802.1X-REV\
    \ and\n   the IETF EAP WG in August 2002.  This enabled participants in the\n\
    \   IETF EAP WG to obtain access to the IEEE 802.1X revision in progress.\n  \
    \ IEEE 802 groups are duty bound to consider all comments received,\n   regardless\
    \ of their origin.  This allows IETF participants to comment\n   as part of the\
    \ IEEE 802 ballot process, regardless of their voting\n   status within IEEE 802.\
    \  Where there is active cooperation, IETF WGs\n   may be made aware that IEEE\
    \ 802 ballots are occurring and that their\n   comments are welcome.  IEEE 802.1X-REV\
    \ and IEEE 802.11i ballots were\n   announced on the EAP WG mailing list, as are\
    \ IEEE 802 interim meeting\n   arrangements.\n   Similarly, during the IEEE 802.1X-REV\
    \ ballot process, comments were\n   received relating to [RFC3748], [RFC4137],\
    \ and [RFC3579].  These\n   comments were tracked on the EAP WG Issues List, and\
    \ were\n   subsequently addressed in the documents.\n   In April 2003, [RFC3580]\
    \ was approved by the IESG for publication as\n   an RFC, and in May 2003, [RFC3579]\
    \ was approved for publication as an\n   RFC.  The review process for both drafts\
    \ involved bringing the\n   documents to IETF last call, and then reposting the\
    \ IETF last-call\n   announcement on the IEEE 802.1 mailing list.  While ballot\
    \ comments\n   on IEEE 802.1X-REV were also reflected in changes to both documents,\n\
    \   it was necessary for both documents to be approved for publication as\n  \
    \ RFCs well in advance of Sponsor Ballot, in order to ensure that RFC\n   numbers\
    \ would be assigned in time, so as to avoid delaying\n   publication.\n   Overall,\
    \ despite the complex inter-dependencies between\n   [IEEE-802.1X-2004], [RFC3748],\
    \ and [RFC4137], the documents were\n   produced without undue delay.  This was\
    \ largely due to the work of\n   joint participants in IEEE 802.1 and IETF EAP\
    \ WG.\n"
- title: A.2.2.  IEEE 802.11i
  contents:
  - "A.2.2.  IEEE 802.11i\n   IEEE 802.11i was chartered to specify security enhancements\
    \ to\n   [IEEE-802.11].  Since [IEEE-802.11i] utilized IEEE 802.1X, it\n   depended\
    \ on [IEEE-802.1X-2004].  As a result, IEEE 802.11i and IEEE\n   802.1 held joint\
    \ meetings at IEEE 802 plenaries and established a\n   liaison arrangement that\
    \ permitted members of either group (as well\n   as EAP WG participants) access\
    \ to IEEE 802.11i work-in-progress.\n   Since [IEEE-802.11i] depended on [IEEE-802.1X-2004],\
    \ it inherited the\n   dependencies of [IEEE-802.1X-2004], including work on EAP,\
    \ EAP\n   methods, and AAA support for EAP.  In addition, since IEEE 802.11i\n\
    \   utilized EAP for key management whereas [IEEE-802.1X] does not,\n   additional\
    \ security requirements arose with respect to EAP methods.\n   In February 2002,\
    \ IEEE 802.11 sent a liaison letter to the IESG\n   [IEEE-80211Liaison1] requesting\
    \ additional work on EAP, EAP methods,\n   and EAP key management.  This letter\
    \ was presented at the second EAP\n   BOF at IETF 53, and was used as input to\
    \ the EAP WG charter.  In\n   March 2003, another liaison letter was presented,\
    \ providing further\n   clarifications on requirements for EAP method work\n \
    \  [IEEE-80211Liaison2].  This included a request from IEEE 802.11i for\n   the\
    \ EAP WG to consider changing the mandatory-to-implement EAP method\n   within\
    \ [RFC3748], so as to provide a method meeting the security\n   requirements of\
    \ IEEE 802.11i.\n   During IETF 56, the request for changing the mandatory-to-implement\n\
    \   method was considered by the EAP WG.  A recommendation was made by\n   the\
    \ Internet Area Director Erik Nordmark that the IEEE 802.11i\n   requirements\
    \ be documented in an RFC and that the EAP WG consider the\n   security requirements\
    \ for EAP methods in various situations.  It was\n   recommended not to change\
    \ the mandatory-to-implement method, since\n   the EAP WG was not chartered to\
    \ do work on methods.  However, it was\n   decided to produce a document describing\
    \ the EAP method requirements\n   for WLAN usage.  This document was subsequently\
    \ published as\n   [RFC4017].\n   Most recently, IEEE 802.11r has been involved\
    \ in discussions relating\n   to fast handoff, which may potentially require AAA\
    \ extensions as well\n   as changes to the EAP key hierarchy.  However, the direction\
    \ of this\n   work has not yet been determined so that no liaison request has\
    \ been\n   formulated yet.\n   In April 2003, Dorothy Stanley was appointed liaison\
    \ from IEEE 802.11\n   to the IETF, in order to help coordinate between IEEE 802.11\
    \ and IETF\n   WGs, including AAA, BMWG, CAPWAP, and EAP.\n"
- title: A.2.3.  IEEE 802.11F
  contents:
  - "A.2.3.  IEEE 802.11F\n   IEEE 802.11F was chartered with development of a recommended\
    \ practice\n   for Inter-Access Point Communications.  As part of development\
    \ of an\n   Inter-Access Point Protocol (IAPP), it was necessary to secure\n \
    \  communications between the access points, as well as to support the\n   reverse\
    \ resolution of the MAC address of the previous access point to\n   its IP address,\
    \ so as to allow the two access points to communicate\n   via IAPP.  Since the\
    \ two access points might not be on the same link,\n   Inverse ARP [RFC2390] was\
    \ not considered sufficient in all cases.\n   IEEE 802.11F elected to extend the\
    \ RADIUS protocol [RFC2865] to\n   provide inverse address resolution as well\
    \ as IPsec key management.\n   This was accomplished via use of Vendor-Specific\
    \ Attributes (VSAs),\n   as well as new RADIUS commands, added through definition\
    \ of\n   additional values for the RADIUS Service-Type attribute.  As a\n   result,\
    \ IETF review was not required under the IANA considerations\n   included in [RFC2865].\
    \  Subsequently, the RADIUS IANA considerations\n   [RFC3575] were revised so\
    \ as to require IETF review in most cases.\n   No liaison arrangement was developed\
    \ between IEEE 802.11F and IETF\n   WGs such as AAA WG or SEAMOBY WG, so as to\
    \ allow IETF participants\n   access to the IEEE 802.11F specifications prior\
    \ to publication.  Once\n   IEEE 802.11F entered into Recirculation ballot, only\
    \ comments\n   relating to changes in the specification could be considered. \
    \ As a\n   result, issues raised relating to the IEEE 802.11F RADIUS extensions\n\
    \   were rejected.\n   IEEE 802.11F was a Trial Use Recommended Practice.  The\
    \ IEEE 802\n   Executive Committee approved its withdrawal on November 18, 2005.\
    \  As\n   a result, the RADIUS parameters allocated for use by IEEE 802.11F are\n\
    \   available to be reclaimed.\n"
