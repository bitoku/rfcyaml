The following is the approved scheme to connect our computers to the network.
This configuration will become effective December 18, 1974.
All host interfaces are local (except host number 005 which is an easily convertible local/distant interface and we have been asked by Div 6 to avoid using it
6 can more easily check out PDP 10 IMP interfaces).
The PDP 11 with the line printer is intentionally on host 105 so that a simple minded program can respond when someone tries to ICP to its logger socket "To login to BBN (System C) use host number 241(10)".
