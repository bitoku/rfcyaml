- title: 1.  Introduction and History
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction and History\n   RFC 4844 [N1] defines four RFC streams.  When\
    \ a document is submitted\n   for publication, the review that it receives depends\
    \ on the stream in\n   which it will be published.  The four streams defined in\
    \ RFC 4844\n   are:\n      - The IETF stream\n      - The IAB stream\n      -\
    \ The IRTF stream\n      - The Independent Submission stream\n   The IETF is responsible\
    \ for maintaining the Internet Standards\n   Process, which includes the requirements\
    \ for developing, reviewing\n   and approving Standards Track and BCP RFCs.  These\
    \ RFCs, and any\n   other IETF-generated Informational or Experimental documents,\
    \ are\n   reviewed by appropriate IETF bodies [N2] and published as part of the\n\
    \   IETF stream.\n   Documents published in streams other than the IETF stream\
    \ might not\n   receive any review by the IETF for such things as security,\n\
    \   congestion control, or inappropriate interaction with deployed\n   protocols.\
    \  Generally, there is no attempt for IETF consensus or IESG\n   approval.  Therefore,\
    \ the IETF disclaims, for any of the non-IETF\n   stream documents, any knowledge\
    \ of the fitness of those RFCs for any\n   purpose.\n   IESG processing described\
    \ in this document is concerned only with the\n   last two categories, which comprise\
    \ the Independent Submission stream\n   and the IRTF stream, respectively [N1].\n\
    \   Following the approval of RFC 2026 [N2] and prior to the publication\n   of\
    \ RFC 3932 [I1], the IESG reviewed all Independent Submission stream\n   documents\
    \ before publication.  This review was often a full-scale\n   review of technical\
    \ content, with the Area Directors (ADs) attempting\n   to clear points with the\
    \ authors, stimulate revisions of the\n   documents, encourage the authors to\
    \ contact appropriate working\n   groups (WGs), and so on.  This was a considerable\
    \ drain on the\n   resources of the IESG, and because this was not the highest\
    \ priority\n   task of the IESG members, it often resulted in significant delays.\n\
    \   In March 2004, the IESG decided to make a major change in this review\n  \
    \ model, with the IESG taking responsibility only for checking for\n   conflicts\
    \ between the work of the IETF and the documents submitted.\n   Soliciting technical\
    \ review is deemed to be the responsibility of the\n   RFC Editor.  If an individual\
    \ AD chooses to review the technical\n   content of the document and finds issues,\
    \ that AD will communicate\n   these issues to the RFC Editor, and they will be\
    \ treated the same way\n   as comments on the documents from other sources.\n\
    \   Prior to 2006, documents from the IRTF were treated as either IAB\n   submissions\
    \ or Independent Submissions via the RFC Editor.  However,\n   the Internet Research\
    \ Steering Group (IRSG) has established a review\n   process for the publication\
    \ of RFCs from the IRTF stream [I2].  Once\n   these procedures are fully adopted,\
    \ the IESG will be responsible only\n   for checking for conflicts between the\
    \ work of the IETF and the\n   documents submitted, but results of the check will\
    \ be reported to the\n   IRTF.  These results may be copied to the RFC Editor\
    \ as a courtesy.\n   This document describes only the review process done by the\
    \ IESG when\n   the RFC Editor or the IRTF requests that review.  The RFC Editor\
    \ will\n   request the review of Independent Submission stream documents, and\n\
    \   the IRTF will request review of IRTF stream documents.  There are\n   many\
    \ other interactions between document editors and the IESG, for\n   instance,\
    \ an AD may suggest that an author submit a document as input\n   for work within\
    \ the IETF rather than to the RFC Editor as part of the\n   Independent Submission\
    \ stream, or the IESG may suggest that a\n   document submitted to the IETF is\
    \ better suited for submission to the\n   RFC Editor as part of Independent Submission\
    \ stream, but these\n   interactions are not described in this memo.\n   For the\
    \ convenience of the reader, this document includes description\n   of some actions\
    \ taken by the RFC Editor, the IAB, and the IRSG.  The\n   inclusion of these\
    \ actions is not normative.  Rather, these actions\n   are included to describe\
    \ the overall process surrounding the\n   normative IESG procedures described\
    \ in this document.  No RFC Editor,\n   IAB, or IRSG procedures are set by this\
    \ document.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Changes since RFC 3932
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Changes since RFC 3932\n   RFC 3932 provided procedures for the review\
    \ of Independent Submission\n   stream submissions.  With the definition of procedures\
    \ by the IRSG\n   for the IRTF stream, it has become clear that similar procedures\n\
    \   apply to the review by the IESG of IRTF stream documents.\n   The IAB and\
    \ the RFC Editor have made updates to the formatting of the\n   title page for\
    \ all RFCs [N3].  With these changes, the upper left\n   hand corner of the title\
    \ page indicates the stream that produced the\n   RFC.  This label replaces some\
    \ of the information that was previously\n   provided in mandatory IESG notes\
    \ on non-IETF-stream documents.\n   The IESG may request the inclusion of an IESG\
    \ note in an Independent\n   Submission or IRTF stream document to explain the\
    \ specific\n   relationship, if any, to IETF work.  In case there is a dispute\
    \ about\n   the content of the IESG note, this document provides a dispute\n \
    \  resolution process.\n"
- title: 2.  Background Material
  contents:
  - "2.  Background Material\n   The review of Independent Submissions by the IESG\
    \ was prescribed by\n   RFC 2026 [N2], Section 4.2.3.  The procedure described\
    \ in this\n   document is compatible with that description.\n   The procedures\
    \ developed by the IRTF for documents created by the\n   Research Groups also\
    \ include review by the IESG [I2].\n   The IESG Charter (RFC 3710 [I5], Section\
    \ 5.2.2) describes the review\n   process that was employed in Spring 2003 (even\
    \ though the RFC was not\n   published until 2004); with the publication of RFC\
    \ 3932 [I1], the\n   procedure described in RFC 3710 was no longer relevant to\
    \ documents\n   submitted via the RFC Editor.  The publication of this document\n\
    \   further updates Section 5.2.2 of RFC 3710, now covering both the IRTF\n  \
    \ and the Independent Submission streams.\n"
- title: 3.  Detailed Description of IESG Review
  contents:
  - "3.  Detailed Description of IESG Review\n   The RFC Editor reviews Independent\
    \ Submission stream submissions for\n   suitability for publication as RFCs. \
    \ As described in RFC 4846 [I3],\n   the RFC Editor asks the IESG to review the\
    \ documents for conflicts\n   with the IETF standards process or work done in\
    \ the IETF community.\n   Similarly, documents intended for publication as part\
    \ of the IRTF\n   stream are sent to the IESG for review for conflicts with the\
    \ IETF\n   standards process or work done in the IETF community [I2].\n   The\
    \ IESG review of these Independent Submission and IRTF stream\n   documents results\
    \ in one of the following five types of conclusion,\n   any of which may be accompanied\
    \ by a request to include an IESG note\n   if the document is published.\n   1.\
    \ The IESG has concluded that there is no conflict between this\n      document\
    \ and IETF work.\n   2. The IESG has concluded that this work is related to IETF\
    \ work done\n      in WG <X>, but this relationship does not prevent publishing.\n\
    \   3. The IESG has concluded that publication could potentially disrupt\n   \
    \   the IETF work done in WG <X> and recommends not publishing the\n      document\
    \ at this time.\n   4. The IESG has concluded that this document violates IETF\
    \ procedures\n      for <Y> and should therefore not be published without IETF\
    \ review\n      and IESG approval.\n   5. The IESG has concluded that this document\
    \ extends an IETF protocol\n      in a way that requires IETF review and should\
    \ therefore not be\n      published without IETF review and IESG approval.\n \
    \  The RFC headers and boilerplate [N3] is intended to describe the\n   relationship\
    \ of the document to the IETF standards process.  In\n   exceptional cases, when\
    \ the relationship of the document to the IETF\n   standards process might be\
    \ unclear, the IESG may request the\n   inclusion of an IESG note to clarify the\
    \ relationship of the document\n   to the IETF standards process.  Such a note\
    \ is likely to include\n   pointers to related IETF RFCs.  The dispute resolution\
    \ process in\n   Section 4 is provided to handle situations in which the IRSG\
    \ or RFC\n   Editor is concerned with the content of the requested IESG note.\n\
    \   The last two responses are included respectively, for the case where\n   a\
    \ document attempts to take actions (such as registering a new URI\n   scheme)\
    \ that require IETF Review, Standards Action, or IESG Approval\n   (as these terms\
    \ are defined in RFC 5226 [I6]), and for the case where\n   there is a proposed\
    \ change or extension to an IETF protocol that was\n   not anticipated by the\
    \ original authors and that may be detrimental\n   to the normal usage of the\
    \ protocol, but where the protocol documents\n   do not explicitly say that this\
    \ type of extension requires IETF\n   review.\n   If a document requires IETF\
    \ review, the IESG will offer the author\n   the opportunity to ask for publication\
    \ as an AD-sponsored individual\n   document, which is subject to full IETF review,\
    \ including possible\n   assignment to a WG or rejection.  Redirection to the\
    \ full IESG review\n   path is not a guarantee that the IESG will accept the work\
    \ item, or\n   even that the IESG will give it any particular priority; it is\
    \ a\n   guarantee that the IESG will consider the document.\n   The IESG will\
    \ normally complete review within four weeks of\n   notification by the RFC Editor\
    \ or IRTF.  In the case of a possible\n   conflict, the IESG may contact a WG\
    \ or a WG Chair for an outside\n   opinion of whether publishing the document\
    \ is harmful to the work of\n   that WG and, in the case of a possible conflict\
    \ with an IANA\n   registration procedure, the IANA expert for that registry.\n\
    \   If the IESG does not find any conflict between an Independent\n   Submission\
    \ and IETF work, then the RFC Editor is responsible for\n   judging the technical\
    \ merits for that submission, including\n   considerations of possible harm to\
    \ the Internet.  If the IESG does\n   not find any conflict between an IRTF submission\
    \ and IETF work, then\n   the IRSG is responsible for judging the technical merits\
    \ for that\n   submission, including considerations of possible harm to the\n\
    \   Internet.\n   The RFC Editor, in agreement with the IAB, shall manage mechanisms\n\
    \   for appropriate technical review of Independent Submissions.\n   Likewise,\
    \ the IRSG, in agreement with the IAB, shall manage\n   mechanisms for appropriate\
    \ technical review of IRTF submissions.\n"
- title: 4.  Dispute Resolution
  contents:
  - "4.  Dispute Resolution\n   Experience has shown that the IESG and the RFC Editor\
    \ have worked\n   well together regarding publication recommendations and IESG\
    \ notes.\n   Where questions have arisen, they have been quickly resolved when\
    \ all\n   parties become aware of the concerns.  However, should a dispute ever\n\
    \   arise, a third party can assist with resolution.  Therefore, this\n   dispute\
    \ procedure has an informal dialogue phase followed by an\n   arbitration phase\
    \ if the matter remains unresolved.\n   If the IESG requests the inclusion of\
    \ an IESG note and the IRSG or\n   the RFC Editor intends to publish the document\
    \ without the requested\n   IESG note, then they must provide a clear and concise\
    \ description of\n   the concerns to the IESG before proceeding.  A proposal for\
    \ alternate\n   IESG note text from the IRSG or the RFC Editor is highly encouraged.\n\
    \   If the IESG does not want the document to be published without the\n   requested\
    \ IESG note, then the IESG must initiate an informal\n   dialogue.  The dialogue\
    \ should not take more than six weeks.  This\n   period of time allows the IESG\
    \ to conduct an IETF Last Call\n   concerning the content of the requested IESG\
    \ note (and not on the\n   document as a whole) to determine community consensus\
    \ if desired.  At\n   the end of the dialogue, the IESG can reaffirm the original\
    \ IESG\n   note, provide an alternate IESG note, or withdraw the note\n   altogether.\
    \  If an IESG note is requested, the IRSG or the RFC Editor\n   must state whether\
    \ they intend to include it.\n   If dialogue fails to resolve IRSG or RFC Editor\
    \ concerns with the\n   content of a requested IESG note and they intend to publish\
    \ the\n   document as an RFC without the requested IESG note, then the IESG can\n\
    \   formally ask the IAB to provide arbitration.  The IAB is not\n   obligated\
    \ to perform arbitration and may decline the request.  If the\n   IAB declines,\
    \ the RFC Editor decides whether the IESG note is\n   included.  If the IAB accepts,\
    \ the IAB review will occur according to\n   procedures of the IAB's own choosing.\
    \  The IAB can direct the\n   inclusion of the IESG note, direct the withdrawal\
    \ of the IESG note,\n   or leave the final decision to the RFC Editor.  Unlike\
    \ the IAB\n   reviews specified in RFC 4846 [I3], if the IAB directs the inclusion\n\
    \   or withdrawal the IESG note, the IAB decision is binding, not\n   advisory.\n"
- title: 5.  Examples of Cases Where Publication Is Harmful
  contents:
  - "5.  Examples of Cases Where Publication Is Harmful\n   This section gives a couple\
    \ of examples where delaying or preventing\n   publication of a document might\
    \ be appropriate due to conflict with\n   IETF work.  It forms part of the background\
    \ material, not a part of\n   the procedure.\n   Rejected Alternative Bypass:\n\
    \      As a WG is working on a solution to a problem, a participant\n      decides\
    \ to ask for Independent Submission stream publication of a\n      solution that\
    \ the WG has rejected.  Publication of the document\n      will give the publishing\
    \ party an RFC number before the WG is\n      finished.  It seems better to have\
    \ the WG product published first,\n      and have the non-adopted document published\
    \ later, with a clear\n      disclaimer note saying that \"the IETF technology\
    \ for this function\n      is X\".\n      Example: Photuris (RFC 2522), which\
    \ was published after\n      IKE (RFC 2409).\n      Note: In general, the IESG\
    \ has no problem with rejected\n      alternatives being made available to the\
    \ community; such\n      publications can be a valuable contribution to the technical\n\
    \      literature.  However, it is necessary to avoid confusion with the\n   \
    \   alternatives adopted by the WG.\n   Inappropriate Reuse of \"free\" Bits:\n\
    \      In 2003, a proposal for an experimental RFC was published that\n      wanted\
    \ to reuse the high bits of the \"fragment offset\" part of the\n      IP header\
    \ for another purpose.  No IANA consideration says how\n      these bits can be\
    \ repurposed, but the standard defines a specific\n      meaning for them.  The\
    \ IESG concluded that implementations of this\n      experiment risked causing\
    \ hard-to-debug interoperability problems\n      and recommended not publishing\
    \ the document in the RFC series.\n      The RFC Editor accepted the recommendation.\n\
    \   The RFC series is one of many available publication channels; this\n   document\
    \ takes no position on the question of which documents are\n   appropriate for\
    \ publication in the RFC Series.  That is a matter for\n   discussion in the Internet\
    \ community.\n"
