Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects to configure and/or monitor Multicast communication over IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) supported by the Multiprotocol Label Switching/Border Gateway Protocol (MPLS/BGP) on a Provider Edge (PE) router.
Introduction [RFC6513], [RFC6514], and [RFC6625]
specify procedures for supporting multicast in Multiprotocol Label Switching/Border Gateway Protocol (MPLS/BGP)
Layer 3 (IP) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
Throughout this document, we will use the term "MVPN" (for "multicast VPN")
[RFC6513] to refer to a BGP/MPLS IP VPN that supports multicast.
Provider Edge (PE) routers that attach to a particular MVPN exchange customer multicast (C multicast) routing information with neighboring PEs.
, two basic methods for exchanging C multicast routing information are defined: (1) Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) [RFC7761] and (2) BGP.
In the rest of this document, we will use the term "PIM MVPN" to refer to the case where PIM is used for exchanging C multicast routing information and "BGP MVPN" to refer to the case where BGP is used for exchanging C multicast routing information.
This document describes managed objects to configure and/or monitor MVPNs.
Most of the managed objects are common to both PIM MVPN and BGP MVPN, and some managed objects are BGP MVPN specific.
This document adopts the definitions, abbreviations, and mechanisms described in [RFC4364], [RFC6513], and [RFC6514].
Layer 3 (L3) VPN, and MVPN concepts and/or mechanisms is assumed.
Some terms specifically related to this document are explained below.
An MVPN can be realized by using various kinds of transport mechanisms for forwarding a packet to all or a subset of PEs across service provider networks.
Such transport mechanisms are referred to as provider tunnels (P tunnels).
A Provider Multicast Service Interface (PMSI)
[RFC6513] is a conceptual interface instantiated by a P tunnel.
A PE uses a PMSI to send customer multicast traffic to all or some PEs in the same VPN.
There are two kinds of PMSIs:
Inclusive PMSI (I PMSI) and Selective PMSI (S PMSI)
I PMSI enables a PE attached to a particular MVPN to transmit a message to all PEs in the same MVPN.
An S PMSI enables a PE to transmit a message to a selected set of PEs in the same MVPN.
As described in [RFC4382], each PE maintains one default forwarding table and zero or more Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) tables.
Throughout this document, we will use the term "MVRF" (for "multicast VRF") to refer to a VRF that contains multicast routing information.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580

current DESCRIPTION "Objects required for MVPN notifications."
This MIB module contains some read only objects that may be deemed sensitive.
It also contains some read write objects whose settings will change the device's MVPN related behavior.
Appropriate security procedures that are related to SNMP in general but are not specific to this MIB module need to be implemented by concerned operators.
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection opens devices to attack.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
The value of this object is used to control the maximum number of selective provider tunnels that a PE allows for a particular MVPN.
Access to this object may be abused to impact the performance of the PE or prevent the PE from having new selective provider tunnels.
The value of this object is used to control the delay for the advertisement of withdrawals of C multicast routes.
Access to this object may be abused to impact the performance of a PE.
The value of this object is used to control the delay for the advertisement of Source/Shared Tree Join C multicast routes.
Access to this object may be abused to impact the propagation of C multicast routing information.
The value of this object is used to control the upper bound for the rate of BGP C multicast routing information message exchange among PEs.
Access to this object may be abused to impact the performance of the PE or disrupt the C multicast routing information message exchange using BGP.
The value of this object is used to control the upper bound for the number of S PMSI A D routes.
Access to this object may be abused to impact the performance of the PE or prevent the PE from receiving S PMSI A D routes.
The value of this object is used to control the upper bound for the frequency of S PMSI A D route generation.
Access to this object may be abused to impact the performance of the PE or prevent the PE from generating new S PMSI A D routes.
The value of this object is used to control the upper bound for the number of Source Active A D routes.
Access to this object may be abused to impact the performance of the PE or prevent the PE from receiving Source Active A D routes.
The value of this object is used to control the upper bound for the frequency of Source Active A D route generation.
Access to this object may be abused to impact the performance of the PE or prevent the PE from generating new Source Active A D routes.
Some of the objects in this MIB module may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
This includes INDEX objects with a MAX ACCESS of not accessible, and any indices from other modules exposed via AUGMENTS.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
The address related objects in this MIB module may have impact on privacy and security.
These objects may reveal the locations of senders and recipients.
mvpnMrouteNextHopAddr SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for authentication and privacy via the User based Security Model (USM)
[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER value recorded in the "SMI Network Management
MGMT Codes Internet standard MIB" registry:
MIB  { mib 2 243 }
