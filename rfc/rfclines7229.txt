Abstract This document provides several certificate policy identifiers for testing certificate handling software.
This document provides several certificate policy identifiers for testing certificate handling software.
These certificate policy identifiers are not intended for use in the public Internet.
The certificate policy identifiers provided in this document are consistent with the certificate profile specified in [RFC5280].
They are appropriate for testing the certificate policy processing, especially the handling of the certificate policy extension, the policy constraints extension, and the policy mapping extension.
Certificate Policy Identifiers for Testing
The following certificate policy identifiers are provided for testing certificate handling software.
object identifiers are used to name certificate policies.
Object Identifiers used ONLY for TESTING
{ id TEST 1 }
{ id TEST 3 }
{ id TEST 4 }
{ id TEST 5 }
This specification does not identify particular certificate policies for use in the Internet public key infrastructure.
The actual policies used for production certificates can have a significant impact on the confidence that one can place in the certificate.
No confidence should be placed in any certificate that makes use of these certificate policy identifiers, since they are intended only for testing.
The object identifiers used in this document are defined in an arc delegated by IANA to the PKIX Working Group.
No further action by IANA is necessary for this document or any anticipated updates.
This appendix provides the certificate policy identifiers (object identifiers) in an ASN.1 module.
No fancy structures are needed, so this module is compatible with [ASN1 2008].
