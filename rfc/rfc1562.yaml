- title: Background
  contents:
  - "Background\n   This document is an AARNet (Australian Academic and Research Network)\n\
    \   Engineering Note (AEN-001).  AARNet Engineering Notes are engineering\n  \
    \ documents of the AARNet Engineering Working Group, and record current\n   or\
    \ proposed operational practices related to the provision of\n   Internetworking\
    \ services within Australia, and AARNet in particular.\n"
- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   AARNet is a member network of the global Internet and participates\
    \ in\n   the global Internet X.500 based Directory Service. A number of RFC's\n\
    \   have been issued that make recommendations that alter or supplement\n   the\
    \ OSI/ETU standards for X.500 [1]. In general, these RFCs will be\n   followed\
    \ by the AARNet Directory Service.  However, in certain cases\n   we wish to align\
    \ ourselves with our national ISO body (Standards\n   Australia) rather than the\
    \ Internet where they conflict.  In naming,\n   we have chosen to align ourselves\
    \ with Standards Australia and this\n   document notes the difference in our approach\
    \ to the Internet\n   guidelines suggested in RFC 1384 [2].\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The intended audience of this document is the administrators\
    \ (or\n   potential administrators) of an X.500 Directory System Agent (DSA).\n\
    \   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the relevant Internet\n   documents,\
    \ especially RFC 1384.\n"
- title: 2.  The Australian X.500 domain
  contents:
  - "2.  The Australian X.500 domain\n   Standards Australia (SAA) have produced a\
    \ document [3] that describes\n   the organisation of the Australian X.500 namespace.\
    \ It is considered\n   that, as far as possible, we should align the AARNet Directory\n\
    \   Service with these requirements in order to provide a smooth\n   transition\
    \ to an Australian Directory Service as ultimately the OSI\n   Registration Authority\
    \ of Standards Australia has naming authority\n   for the DIT subtree underneath\
    \ the node \"c=AU\".\n   The SAA document defines only two types of objects that\
    \ can be placed\n   directly below the c=AU node in the DIT, organisations with\n\
    \   nationally recognised names and localities representing the states\n   and\
    \ territories of the Commonwealth of Australia.\n   It is intended to follow this\
    \ scheme with one modification. The\n   recommendation doesn't indicate where\
    \ ADMD and PRMD names should be\n   registered and so these objects will be treated\
    \ as for organisations\n   with nationally recognised names.\n"
- title: 3.  Entries representing DSAs
  contents:
  - "3.  Entries representing DSAs\n   The naming convention currently used by the\
    \ Internet leads to a large\n   amount of clutter due to organisational DSAs being\
    \ named directly\n   under the country node. The \"normal\" user of a directory\
    \ service\n   isn't interested in the mechanics of the service and so the presence\n\
    \   of these entries in such a prominent location is unfortunate. In\n   order\
    \ to avoid this clutter, and to conform to SAA requirements, we\n   have created\
    \ a pseudo organisation called DMD where all Australian\n   DSAs should be registered.\n\
    \   Rather than continue the Quipu tradition of naming DSAs after\n   endangered\
    \ South American animals, in Australia, it is suggested that\n   DSAs be named\
    \ after Australian fauna.\n"
- title: 4.  Entries representing the states and territories of Australia
  contents:
  - "4.  Entries representing the states and territories of Australia\n   Immediately\
    \ subordinate to the Australian entry are locality objects\n   representing the\
    \ eight states and territories of the Commonwealth of\n   Australia. The RDN of\
    \ these entries will use the stateOrProvinceName\n   attribute and have values\
    \ consisting of the standard Australian two\n   or three letter abbreviations\
    \ for the particular state of territory.\n"
- title: 5.  Entries representing organisations
  contents:
  - "5.  Entries representing organisations\n   SAA recommends that organisations\
    \ are registered as immediate\n   subordinates of either the Australian entry\
    \ or of the eight states\n   and territories depending on the uniqueness of the\
    \ organisation's\n   name.\n   Organisations that can demonstrate that they have\
    \ a name unique\n   within Australia (for example, if it has been allocated a\
    \ name by an\n   organisation that can guarantee this uniqueness such as the\n\
    \   Australian Securities Commission) may be added immediately beneath\n   the\
    \ Australian entry.  If the name is only unique within a specific\n   state or\
    \ territory, then the entry must be added immediately beneath\n   the state entry.\n\
    \   The names chosen for the distinguished name of an organisation must\n   be\
    \ the officially registered name of the organisation and have a\n   maximum length\
    \ of 64 characters, but other more familiar names can be\n   added as additional\
    \ organisation names to aid searching.\n"
- title: 6.  Entries representing residential people
  contents:
  - "6.  Entries representing residential people\n   An individual may be registered\
    \ in the directory and their entry will\n   be placed subordinate to the entry\
    \ for their state of residence. The\n   RDN of such an entry will be composed\
    \ of a combination of their\n   common name and their street address.\n"
