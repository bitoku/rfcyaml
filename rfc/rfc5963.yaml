- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Most Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) work at the Layer 2\
    \ level,\n   making the adoption of IPv6 an easy task.  However, IXPs normally\n\
    \   implement additional services such as statistics, route servers,\n   looking\
    \ glasses, and broadcast controls that may be impacted by the\n   implementation\
    \ of IPv6.  This document clarifies the impact of IPv6\n   on a new or an existing\
    \ IXP.  The document assumes an Ethernet switch\n   fabric, although other Layer\
    \ 2 configurations could be deployed.\n"
- title: 2.  Switch Fabric Configuration
  contents:
  - "2.  Switch Fabric Configuration\n   An Ethernet-based IXP switch fabric implements\
    \ IPv6 over Ethernet as\n   described in [RFC2464] .  Therefore, the switching\
    \ of IPv6 traffic\n   happens in the same way as in IPv4.  However, some management\n\
    \   functions (such as switch management, SNMP (Simple Network Management\n  \
    \ Protocol) [RFC3411] support, or flow analysis exportation) may\n   require IPv6\
    \ as an underlying layer, and this should be assessed by\n   the IXP operator.\n\
    \   There are two common configurations of IXP switch ports to support\n   IPv6:\n\
    \   1.  dual-stack LAN (Local Area Network): when both IPv4 and IPv6\n       traffic\
    \ share a common LAN.  No extra configuration is required\n       in the switch.\n\
    \   2.  independent VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)[IEEE.P802-1Q.1998]:\n  \
    \     when an IXP logically separates IPv4 and IPv6 traffic in\n       different\
    \ VLANs.\n   In both configurations, IPv6 and IPv4 traffic can either share a\n\
    \   common physical port or use independent physical ports.  The use of\n   independent\
    \ ports can be more costly in both capital expenses (as new\n   ports are needed)\
    \ and operational expenses.\n   When using the same physical port for both IPv4\
    \ and IPv6 traffic,\n   some changes may be needed at the participants' interfaces'\n\
    \   configurations.  If the IXP implements the \"dual-stack\n   configuration\"\
    , IXP's participants will configure dual-stack\n   interfaces.  On the other hand,\
    \ if the IXP implements the\n   \"independent VLAN configuration\", IXP participants\
    \ are required to\n   pass one additional VLAN tag across the interconnection.\
    \  In this\n   case, if the IXP did not originally use VLAN tagging, VLAN tagging\n\
    \   should be established and the previously configured LAN may continue\n   untagged\
    \ as a \"native VLAN\" or be transitioned to a tagged VLAN.  The\n   \"independent\
    \ VLAN\" configuration provides a logical separation of\n   IPv4 and IPv6 traffic,\
    \ simplifying separate statistical analysis for\n   IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.  Conversely,\
    \ the \"dual-stack\" configuration\n   (when performing separate statistical analysis\
    \ for IPv4 and IPv6\n   traffic) would require the use of flow techniques such\
    \ as IPFIX (IP\n   Flow Information Export) [RFC5101] to classify traffic based\
    \ on the\n   different Ethertypes (0x0800 for IPv4, 0x0806 for ARP (Address\n\
    \   Resolution Protocol), and 0x86DD for IPv6).\n   The only technical requirement\
    \ for IPv6 referring link MTUs is that\n   they need to be greater than or equal\
    \ to 1280 octets [RFC2460].  The\n   MTU size for every LAN in an IXP should be\
    \ well known by all its\n   participants.\n"
- title: 3.  Addressing Plan
  contents:
  - "3.  Addressing Plan\n   Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) have specific address\
    \ policies to\n   assign Provider Independent (PI) IPv6 addresses to IXPs.  Those\n\
    \   allocations are usually /48 or shorter prefixes [RIR_IXP_POLICIES].\n   Depending\
    \ on the country and region of operation, address assignments\n   may be made\
    \ by NIRs (National Internet Registries).  Unique Local\n   IPv6 Unicast Addresses\
    \ ([RFC4193]) are normally not used in an IXP\n   LAN as global reverse DNS resolution\
    \ and whois services are required.\n   IXPs will normally use manual address configuration.\
    \  The manual\n   configuration of IPv6 addresses allows IXP participants to replace\n\
    \   network interfaces with no need to reconfigure Border Gateway\n   Protocol\
    \ (BGP) sessions' information, and it also facilitates\n   management tasks. \
    \ The IPv6 Addressing Architecture [RFC4291]\n   requires that interface identifiers\
    \ are 64 bits in size for prefixes\n   not starting with binary 000, resulting\
    \ in a maximum prefix length of\n   /64.  Longer prefix lengths up to /127 have\
    \ been used operationally.\n   If prefix lengths longer than 64 bits are chosen,\
    \ the implications\n   described in [RFC3627] need to be considered.  A /48 prefix\
    \ allows\n   the addressing of 65536 /64 LANs.\n   When selecting the use of static\
    \ Interface Identifiers (IIDs), there\n   are different options on how to fill\
    \ its 64 bits (or 16 hexadecimal\n   characters).  A non-exhaustive list of possible\
    \ IID selection\n   mechanisms is the following:\n   1.  Some IXPs like to include\
    \ the decimal encoding of each\n       participant's ASN (Autonomous System Number)\
    \ inside its\n       correspondent IPv6 address.  The ASN decimal number is used\
    \ as\n       the BCD (binary code decimal) encoding of the upper part of the\n\
    \       IID such as shown in this example:\n       *  IXP LAN prefix: 2001:db8::/64\n\
    \       *  ASN: 64496\n       *  IPv6 Address: 2001:db8:0000:0000:0000:0006:4496:0001/64\
    \ or its\n          equivalent representation 2001:db8::6:4496:1/64\n       In\
    \ this example, we are right-justifying the participant's ASN\n       number from\
    \ the 112nd bit.  Remember that 32-bit ASNs require a\n       maximum of 10 characters.\
    \  With this example, up to 2^16 IPv6\n       addresses can be configured per\
    \ ASN.\n   2.  Although BCD encoding is more \"human-readable\", some IXPs prefer\n\
    \       to use the hexadecimal encoding of the ASNs number as the upper\n    \
    \   part of the IID as follow:\n       *  IXP LAN prefix: 2001:db8::/64\n    \
    \   *  ASN: 64496 (DEC) or fbf0 (HEX)\n       *  IPv6 Address: 2001:db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:fbf0:0001/64\
    \ or its\n          equivalent representation 2001:db8::fbf0:1/64\n       In this\
    \ case, a maximum of 8 characters will be needed to\n       represent 32-bit ASNs.\n\
    \   3.  A third scheme for statically assigning IPv6 addresses on an IXP\n   \
    \    LAN could be to relate some portions of a participant's IPv6\n       address\
    \ to its IPv4 address.  In the following example, the last\n       four decimals\
    \ of the IPv4 address are copied to the last\n       hexadecimals of the IPv6\
    \ address, using the decimal number as the\n       BCD encoding for the last three\
    \ characters of the IID such as in\n       the following example:\n       *  IXP\
    \ LAN prefix: 2001:db8::/64\n       *  IPv4 Address: 192.0.2.123/23\n       *\
    \  IPv6 Address: 2001:db8:2::123/64\n   4.  A fourth approach might be based on\
    \ the IXPs ID for that\n       participant.\n   IPv6 prefixes for IXP LANs are\
    \ typically publicly well known and\n   taken from dedicated IPv6 blocks for IXP\
    \ assignments reserved for\n   this purpose by the different RIRs.  These blocks\
    \ are usually only\n   meant for addressing the exchange fabric, and may be filtered\
    \ out by\n   DFZ (Default Free Zone) operators.  When considering the routing\
    \ of\n   the IXP LANs two options are identified:\n   o  IXPs may decide that\
    \ LANs should not to be globally routed in\n      order to limit the possible\
    \ origins of a Denial-of-Service (DoS)\n      attack to its participants' AS (Autonomous\
    \ System) boundaries.  In\n      this configuration, participants may route these\
    \ prefixes inside\n      their networks (e.g., using BGP no-export communities\
    \ or routing\n      the IXP LANs within the participants' IGP) to perform fault\n\
    \      management.  Using this configuration, the monitoring of the IXP\n    \
    \  LANs from outside of its participants' AS boundaries is not\n      possible.\n\
    \   o  IXP may decide that LANs should (attempt to) be globally routed.\n    \
    \  In this case, IXP LANs monitoring from outside its participants'\n      AS\
    \ boundaries may be possible, but the IXP LANs will be vulnerable\n      to DoS\
    \ from outside of those boundaries.\n   Additionally, possible IXP external services\
    \ (such as DNS, web pages,\n   FTP servers) need to be globally routed.  These\
    \ should be addressed\n   from separate address blocks, either from upstream providers'\
    \ address\n   space or separate independent assignments.  Strict prefix length\n\
    \   filtering could be a reason for requesting more than one /48\n   assignment\
    \ from a RIR (i.e., requesting one /48 assignment for the\n   IXPs LANs that may\
    \ not be globally routed and a different, non-IXP\n   /48 assignment for the IXP\
    \ external services that will be globally\n   routed).\n"

  - "4.  Multicast IPv6\n   There are two elements that need to be evaluated when\
    \ studying IPv6\n   multicast in an IXP: multicast support for neighbor discovery\
    \ and\n   multicast peering.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Multicast Support and Monitoring for Neighbor Discovery at an IXP
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Multicast Support and Monitoring for Neighbor Discovery at an IXP\n   IXPs\
    \ typically control broadcast traffic across the switching fabric\n   in order\
    \ to avoid broadcast storms by only allowing limited ARP\n   [RFC0826] traffic\
    \ for address resolution.  In IPv6 there is not\n   broadcast support, but IXPs\
    \ may intend to control multicast traffic\n   in each LAN instead.  ICMPv6 Neighbor\
    \ Discovery [RFC4861] implements\n   the following necessary functions in an IXP\
    \ switching fabric: Address\n   Resolution, Neighbor Unreachability Detection,\
    \ and Duplicate Address\n   Detection.  In order to perform these functions, Neighbor\n\
    \   Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisement packets are exchanged using\n   the\
    \ link-local all-nodes multicast address (ff02::1) and/or\n   solicited-node multicast\
    \ addresses (ff02:0:0:0:0:1:ff00:0000 to ff02:\n   0:0:0:0:1:ffff:ffff).  As described\
    \ in [RFC4861], routers will\n   initialize their interfaces by joining their\
    \ solicited-node multicast\n   addresses using either Multicast Listener Discovery\
    \ (MLD) [RFC2710]\n   or MLDv2 [RFC3810].  MLD messages may be sent to the corresponding\n\
    \   group address: ff02::2 (MLD) or ff02::16 (MLDv2).  Depending on the\n   addressing\
    \ plan selected by the IXP, each solicited-node multicast\n   group may be shared\
    \ by a sub-set of participants' conditioned by how\n   the last three octets of\
    \ the addresses are selected.  In Section 3,\n   example 1, only participants\
    \ with ASNs with the same last two digits\n   are going to share the same solicited-node\
    \ multicast group.\n   Similar to the ARP policy, an IXP may limit multicast traffic\
    \ across\n   the switching fabric in order to only allow ICMPv6 Neighbor\n   Solicitation,\
    \ Neighbor Advertisement, and MLD messages.  Configuring\n   default routes in\
    \ an IXP LAN without an agreement between the parties\n   is normally against\
    \ IXP policies.  ICMPv6 Router Advertisement\n   packets should neither be issued\
    \ nor accepted by routers connected to\n   the IXP.  Where possible, the IXP operator\
    \ should block link-local RA\n   (Router Advertisement) packets using IPv6 RA-GUARD\
    \ [V6OPS-RA-GUARD] .\n   If this is not possible, the IXP operator should monitor\
    \ the exchange\n   for rogue Router Advertisement packets as described in\n  \
    \ [V6OPS-ROGUE-RA] .\n"
- title: 4.2.  IPv6 Multicast Traffic Exchange at an IXP
  contents:
  - "4.2.  IPv6 Multicast Traffic Exchange at an IXP\n   For IPv6 Multicast traffic\
    \ exchange, an IXP may decide to use either\n   the same LAN being used for unicast\
    \ IPv6 traffic exchange, the same\n   LAN being used for IPv4 Multicast traffic\
    \ exchange, or a dedicated\n   LAN for IPv6 Multicast traffic exchange.  The reason\
    \ for having a\n   dedicated LAN for multicast is to prevent unwanted multicast\
    \ traffic\n   from reaching participants that do not have multicast support.\n\
    \   Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) [RFC4601] messages will be sent\n   to\
    \ the link-local IPv6 'ALL-PIM-ROUTERS' multicast group ff02::d in\n   the selected\
    \ LAN and should be allowed.  Implementing IPv6 PIM\n   snooping will allow only\
    \ the participants associated with a\n   particular group to receive its multicast\
    \ traffic.  BGP reachability\n   information for IPv6 multicast address family\
    \ (SAFI=2) is normally\n   exchanged using MP-BGP (Multi-Protocol BGP) [RFC4760]\
