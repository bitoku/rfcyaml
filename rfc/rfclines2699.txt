This investigation only targeted the protocols as documented in the Request For Comments Series (RFCs).
This investigation discovered little reason for concern with regards to the functionality of the protocols.
A few minor cases of older implementations still using two digit years (ala RFC 850) were discovered, but almost all Internet protocols were given a clean bill of health.
Several cases of "period" problems were discovered, where a time field would "roll over" as the size of field was reached.
