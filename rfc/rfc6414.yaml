  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IP network layer provides route convergence to protect\
    \ data\n   traffic against planned and unplanned failures in the Internet.  Fast\n\
    \   convergence times are critical to maintain reliable network\n   connectivity\
    \ and performance.  Convergence Events [6] are recognized\n   at the IP Layer\
    \ so that Route Convergence [6] occurs.  Technologies\n   that function at sub-IP\
    \ layers can be enabled to provide further\n   protection of IP traffic by providing\
    \ the failure recovery at the\n   sub-IP layers so that the outage is not observed\
    \ at the IP layer.\n   Such sub-IP protection technologies include, but are not\
    \ limited to,\n   High Availability (HA) stateful failover, Virtual Router Redundancy\n\
    \   Protocol (VRRP) [8], Automatic Link Protection (APS) for SONET/SDH,\n   Resilient\
    \ Packet Ring (RPR) for Ethernet, and Fast Reroute for\n   Multiprotocol Label\
    \ Switching (MPLS-FRR) [9].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Scope
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Scope\n   Benchmarking terminology was defined for IP-layer convergence\
    \ in [6].\n   Different terminology and methodologies specific to benchmarking\
    \ sub-\n   IP layer protection mechanisms are required.  The metrics for\n   benchmarking\
    \ the performance of sub-IP protection mechanisms are\n   measured at the IP layer,\
    \ so that the results are always measured in\n   reference to IP and independent\
    \ of the specific protection mechanism\n   being used.  The purpose of this document\
    \ is to provide a single\n   terminology for benchmarking sub-IP protection mechanisms.\n\
    \   A common terminology for sub-IP layer protection mechanism\n   benchmarking\
    \ enables different implementations of a protection\n   mechanism to be benchmarked\
    \ and evaluated.  In addition,\n   implementations of different protection mechanisms\
    \ can be benchmarked\n   and evaluated.  It is intended that there can exist unique\n\
    \   methodology documents for each sub-IP protection mechanism based upon\n  \
    \ this common terminology document.  The terminology can be applied to\n   methodologies\
    \ that benchmark sub-IP protection mechanism performance\n   with a single stream\
    \ of traffic or multiple streams of traffic.  The\n   traffic flow may be unidirectional\
    \ or bidirectional as to be\n   indicated in the methodology.\n"
- title: 1.2.  General Model
  contents:
  - "1.2.  General Model\n   The sequence of events to benchmark the performance of\
    \ sub-IP\n   protection mechanisms is as follows:\n   1. Failover Event - Primary\
    \ Path fails\n   2. Failure Detection - Failover Event is detected\n   3. Failover\
    \ - Backup Path becomes the Working Path due to Failover\n      Event\n   4. Restoration\
    \ - Primary Path recovers from a Failover Event\n   5. Reversion (optional) -\
    \ Primary Path becomes the Working Path\n   These terms are further defined in\
    \ this document.\n   Figures 1 through 5 show models that MAY be used when benchmarking\n\
    \   sub-IP protection mechanisms, which MUST use a Protection-Switching\n   System\
    \ that consists of a minimum of two Protection-Switching Nodes,\n   an Ingress\
    \ Node known as the Headend Node and an Egress Node known as\n   the Merge Node.\
    \  The Protection-Switching System MUST include either\n   a Primary Path and\
    \ Backup Path, as shown in Figures 1 through 4, or a\n   Primary Node and Standby\
    \ Node, as shown in Figure 5.  A Protection-\n   Switching System may provide\
    \ link protection, node protection, path\n   protection, local link protection,\
    \ and high availability, as shown in\n   Figures 1 through 5, respectively.  A\
    \ Failover Event occurs along the\n   Primary Path or at the Primary Node.  The\
    \ Working Path is the Primary\n   Path prior to the Failover Event and the Backup\
    \ Path after the\n   Failover Event.  A Tester is set outside the two paths or\
    \ nodes as it\n   sends and receives IP traffic along the Working Path.  The tester\n\
    \   MUST record the IP packet sequence numbers, departure time, and\n   arrival\
    \ time so that the metrics of Failover Time, Additive Latency,\n   Packet Reordering,\
    \ Duplicate Packets, and Reversion Time can be\n   measured.  The Tester may be\
    \ a single device or a test system.  If\n   Reversion is supported, then the Working\
    \ Path is the Primary Path\n   after Restoration (Failure Recovery) of the Primary\
    \ Path.\n   Link Protection, as shown in Figure 1, provides protection when a\n\
    \   Failover Event occurs on the link between two nodes along the Primary\n  \
    \ Path.  Node Protection, as shown in Figure 2, provides protection\n   when a\
    \ Failover Event occurs at a Node along the Primary Path.  Path\n   Protection,\
    \ as shown in Figure 3, provides protection for link or\n   node failures for\
    \ multiple hops along the Primary Path.  Local Link\n   Protection, as shown in\
    \ Figure 4, provides sub-IP protection of a\n   link between two nodes, without\
    \ a Backup Node.  An example of such a\n   sub-IP protection mechanism is SONET\
    \ APS.  High Availability\n   Protection, as shown in Figure 5, provides protection\
    \ of a Primary\n   Node with a redundant Standby Node.  State Control is provided\n\
    \   between the Primary and Standby Nodes.  Failure of the Primary Node\n   is\
    \ detected at the sub-IP layer to force traffic to switch to the\n   Standby Node,\
    \ which has state maintained for zero or minimal packet\n   loss.\n          \

  - "3.1.1.  Path\n   Definition:\n      A unidirectional sequence of nodes <R1, ...,\
    \ Rn> and links\n      <L12,... L(n-1)n> with the following properties:\n    \
    \  a. R1 is the ingress node and forwards IP packets, which input\n         into\
    \ DUT/SUT, to R2 as sub-IP frames over link L12.\n      b. Ri is a node which\
    \ forwards data frames to R(i+1) over Link\n         Li(i+1) for all i, 1<i<n-1,\
    \ based on information in the sub-IP\n         layer.\n      c. Rn is the egress\
    \ node, and it outputs sub-IP frames from\n         DUT/SUT as IP packets.  L(n-1)n\
    \ is the link between the R(n-1)\n         and Rn.\n   Discussion:\n      The\
    \ path is defined in the sub-IP layer in this document, unlike\n      an IP path\
    \ in RFC 2026 [1].  One path may be regarded as being\n      equivalent to one\
    \ IP link between two IP nodes, i.e., R1 and Rn.\n      The two IP nodes may have\
    \ multiple paths for protection.  A packet\n      will travel on only one path\
    \ between the nodes.  Packets belonging\n      to a microflow [10] will traverse\
    \ one or more paths.  The path is\n      unidirectional.  For example, the link\
    \ between R1 and R2 in the\n      direction from R1 to R2 is L12.  For traffic\
    \ flowing in the\n      reverse direction from R2 to R1, the link is L21.  Example\
    \ paths\n      are the SONET/SDH path and the label switched path for MPLS.\n\
    \   Measurement Units:\n      n/a\n   Issues:\n      \"A bidirectional path\"\
    , which transmits traffic in both directions\n      along the same nodes, consists\
    \ of two unidirectional paths.\n      Therefore, the two unidirectional paths\
    \ belonging to \"one\n      bidirectional path\" will be treated independently\
    \ when\n      benchmarking for \"a bidirectional path\".\n   See Also:\n     \
