  - "                       Restricted Use of IMP DDT\n    At the recent workshop\
    \ on \"Automated Resource Sharing on the\nARPANET\", considerable interest was\
    \ expressed on the topic of network\nsecurity.  In particular, representatives\
    \ of several sites felt that\nuncontrolled use of IMP DDT made access control\
    \ mechanisms quite\nvulnerable to interception or tampering.* Individuals at the\
    \ workshop\nseemed to be in general agreement that use of DDT should be much more\n\
    controlled than at present.  In addition, as the network continues to\ntake on\
    \ a more and more operational character, and NCC use of DDT (which\nmust be coordinated\
    \ with other DDT usage) increases** we begin to see\nother reasons for controlling\
    \ access to the DDT mechanism.\n    Currently, and for the foreseeable future,\
    \ it is important that the\nNCC be able to use DDT at any IMP at any time.  It\
    \ is also sometimes\nnecessary for site personnel to be able to operate a stand\
    \ alone DDT\nafter an IMP crash.  Sometimes the NCC needs to ask site personnel\
    \ to\noperate the IMP DDT for the NCC if the network is partitioned.  We have\n\
    protected all DDT commands that can affect the running IMP program by\nrequiring\
    \ that sense switch 4 be turned on at the site, or a software\noverride flag be\
    \ enabled.  Only the BBN IMP Teletype, the BBN TIP\nTeletype, and the PDP-1 can\
    \ enable override.  The NCC monitors these\nflags and reports any change in status.\n\
    \    In line with this approach, we will soon modify the IMP system so\nthat any\
    \ access to IMP DDT will require the same enabling actions (sense\nswitch four\
    \ turned on or override enabled from BBN) now required for\ncore modification.\
    \  This will still allow the NCC the same ability to\noperate DDT which it now\
    \ has, and will permit site personnel to operate\nDDT at the request of the NCC.\
    \  As is currently true, the NCC will\n----------------\n*Examples are easy to\
    \ construct, but are intentionally omitted from this\ndocument.\n**DDT is currently\
    \ used by the NCC operators for core verification, for\ninterface debugging, for\
    \ loading TIP and VDH code, etc.  There is\ndiscussion of using DDT in conjunction\
    \ with an \"auto-dialer\" to examine\na TIP's \"view\" of a modem port at the\
    \ same time that the auto-dialer is\nexamining the outside world's \"view\" of\
    \ the port, of running \"automatic\"\ncore verification, of loading Satellite\
    \ IMP code, etc.\nmonitor the setting of sense switch four and take appropriate\
    \ action if\nunauthorized use is observed.  We feel that this change will be\n\
    sufficient to discourage \"hackers\", although it is obviously\ninsufficient to\
    \ protect a node against a determined and malicious\nattack.\n    It should be\
    \ noted that it is not our current intent to prohibit\noccasional use of DDT for\
    \ communication between sites via \"DDT\"\nmessages.  Currently, there are two\
    \ DDT commands, C and L, which set the\nsingle-character message and multi-character\
    \ message headers\nrespectively.  We will continue this facility, either by always\n\
    permitting the use of these DDT commands, or by implementing some new\ncode outside\
    \ DDT for this purpose.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form\
