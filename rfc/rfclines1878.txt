Abstract This memo clarifies issues surrounding subnetting IP networks by providing a standard subnet table.
This table includes subnetting for Class A, B, and C networks, as well as Network IDs, host ranges and IP broadcast addresses with emphasis on Class C subnets.
This memo is intended as an informational companion to Subneting RFC [1] and the Hosts Requirements RFC [2].
Introduction The growth of networking since the time of STD 5, RFC 950 and STD 3, RFC 1123 has resulted in larger and more complex network subnetting.
The previously mentioned RFCs comprise the available guidelines for creating subnetted networks,
however they have occassionaly been misinterpreted leading to confusion regarding proper subnetting.
This document itemizes the potential values for IPv4 subnets.
Additional information is provided for Hex and Decmial values, classfull equivalants, and number of addresses available within the indicated block.
The following table lists the variable length subnets from 1 to 32, the CIDR [3] representation form (/xx) and the Decmial equivalents.
(M   Million, K Thousand, A,B,C  traditional class values)
This is a single host route Subnets and Networks
The number of available network and host addresses are derived from the number of bits used for subnet masking.
The tables below depict the number of subnetting bits and the resulting network, broadcast address, and host addresses.
Please note that all zeros and all ones subnets are included in Tables 1 1 and 1 2 per the current, standards  based practice for using all definable subnets [4].
Table 1 1 represents traditional subnetting of a Class B network address.
Host Addr Range  Brodcast Addr.
Bits of Subnet  hosts/subnet 255.255.128.0   2 nets
N.N.3.255 6 bit subnet    1022
N.N.254.255 Table 1 2 represents traditional subnetting of a Class C network address (which is identical to extended Class B subnets).
Host Addr Range  Brodcast Addr.
Bits of Subnet  hosts/subnet 255.255.255.128 2
N.N.N.127 1 bit Class C   126
N.N.N.129 158    N.N.N.159 N.N.N.160   N.N.N.161 190    N.N.N.191 N.N.N.192
N.N.N.225 254    N.N.N.255 255.255.255.240 16 nets
N.N.N.103 N.N.N.104   N.N.N.105 110    N.N.N.111 N.N.N.112
N.N.N.137 142    N.N.N.143 N.N.N.144   N.N.N.145 150
N.N.N.7 14 bit Class B
N.N.N.245 246    N.N.N.247 N.N.N.248   N.N.N.249 250    N.N.N.251 N.N.N.252   N.N.N.253 254    N.N.N.255
For the sake of completeness within this memo, tables 2 1 and 2 2
illistrate some options for subnet/host partions within selected block sizes using calculations which exclude all zeros and all ones subnets [2].
Many vendors only support subnetting based upon this premise.
Modern software will be able to utilize all definable networks.
Subnet all zeroes and all ones excluded.
Host all zeroes and all ones excluded.
