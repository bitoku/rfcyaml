  - "1.  Introduction\n   It has been discovered that certain BGP Path Attribute values
    have\n   been used in BGP implementations that have been deployed in the wild\n
    \  while not being assigned by IANA for such usage.  Unregistered usage\n   of
    BGP Path Attribute values can lead to deployment problems for new\n   technologies.\n
    \  The use of these unregistered values was noticed when the BGP Large\n   Communities
    attribute [RFC8092] was initially assigned value 30 by\n   IANA.  It was subsequently
    discovered that a widely deployed BGP-4\n   [RFC4271] implementation had released
    code that used path attribute\n   30 and that applied a \"Treat-as-withdraw\"
    [RFC7606] strategy to\n   routes containing a valid Large Community attribute,
    since it was\n   expecting a different data structure.  Because these routes were\n
    \  dropped, early adopters of Large Communities were unreachable from\n   parts
    of the Internet.  As a workaround, a new Early IANA Allocation\n   was requested.\n
    \  The squatting of values 30, 31, 129, 241, 242, and 243 has been\n   confirmed
    by the involved vendors or through source code review.\n"

  - "2.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has marked values 30, 31, 129, 241, 242, and
    243 as \"Deprecated\"\n   in the \"BGP Path Attributes\" subregistry under the
    \"Border Gateway\n   Protocol (BGP) Parameters\" registry.  The marking \"Deprecated\"
    means\n   \"use is not recommended\" ([IANA-GUIDELINES]).\n"
