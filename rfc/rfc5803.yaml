- title: 1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.  Overview\n   This document describes how the authPassword LDAP attribute\n\
    \   [AUTHPASS] can be used for storing secrets used by [SCRAM] Simple\n   Authentication\
    \ and Security Layer [RFC4422] Mechanisms.\n      The \"scheme\" part of the authPassword\
    \ attribute is the SCRAM\n      mechanism name (always without the \"-PLUS\" suffix),\
    \ e.g., \"SCRAM-\n      SHA-1\".  See [SCRAM] for the exact syntax of SCRAM mechanism\n\
    \      names.\n      The \"authInfo\" part of the authPassword attribute is the\
    \ iteration\n      count (iter-count in the ABNF below), followed by \":\" and\
    \ base64-\n      encoded [BASE64] salt.\n      The \"authValue\" part of the authPassword\
    \ attribute is the base64-\n      encoded [BASE64] StoredKey [SCRAM], followed\
    \ by \":\" and base64-\n      encoded [BASE64] ServerKey [SCRAM].\n   Syntax of\
    \ the attribute can be expressed using ABNF [RFC5234].  Non-\n   terminal references\
    \ in the following ABNF are defined in either\n   [AUTHPASS], [RFC4422], or [RFC5234].\n\
    \       scram-mech     = \"SCRAM-SHA-1\" / scram-mech-ext\n                  \
    \    ; Complies with ABNF for <scheme>\n                      ; defined in [AUTHPASS].\n\
    \       scram-authInfo = iter-count \":\" salt\n                      ; Complies\
    \ with ABNF for <authInfo>\n                      ; defined in [AUTHPASS].\n \
    \      scram-authValue = stored-key \":\" server-key\n                      ;\
    \ Complies with ABNF for <authValue>\n                      ; defined in [AUTHPASS].\n\
    \       iter-count   = %x31-39 *DIGIT\n                      ; SCRAM iteration\
    \ count.\n                      ; A positive number without leading zeros.\n \
    \      salt         = <base64-encoded value>\n       stored-key   = <base64-encoded\
    \ value>\n                      ; See definition in [SCRAM].\n       server-key\
    \   = <base64-encoded value>\n                      ; See definition in [SCRAM].\n\
    \       scram-mech-ext = \"SCRAM-\" 1*9mech-char\n                      ; Other\
    \ SCRAM mechanisms registered\n                      ; in the IANA registry for\
    \ SASL\n                      ; mechanism names.\n       mech-char    = <Defined\
    \ in RFC 4422>\n   Note that the authPassword attribute is multivalued.  For example,\
    \ it\n   may contain multiple SCRAM hashes for different hashing algorithms.\n"

- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   This document defines how the authPassword attribute\
    \ can be used to\n   store SCRAM secrets.  Therefore, security considerations\
    \ relevant to\n   [SCRAM] and hash functions used with it are also relevant to\
    \ this\n   document.\n   General security considerations related to the authPassword\
    \ attribute\n   (as specified in [AUTHPASS]) also apply to the use of authPassword\
    \ as\n   specified in this document.  In particular, the values of\n   authPassword\
    \ SHOULD be protected as if they were cleartext passwords.\n   A read operation\
    \ on this attribute that is not protected by a privacy\n   layer (such as IPsec\
    \ or TLS) can expose this attribute to an attacker\n   who a) would be able to\
    \ use the intercepted value to impersonate the\n   user to all servers providing\
    \ SCRAM access using the same hash\n   function, password, iteration count, and\
    \ salt or b) would be able to\n   perform an offline dictionary or brute-force\
    \ attack in order to\n   recover the user's password.\n   Servers MUST validate\
    \ the format of the authPassword attribute before\n   using it for performing\
    \ a SCRAM authentication exchange.  It is\n   possible that an attacker compromised\
    \ the LDAP server or got access\n   to the entry containing the attribute in order\
    \ to exploit a\n   vulnerability in the subsystem performing the SCRAM authentication\n\
    \   exchange.  Big iteration counts and invalid base64 encoding are two\n   possible\
    \ (but not the only) exploits in the format specified in the\n   document.\n"
