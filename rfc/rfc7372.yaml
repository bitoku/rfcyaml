  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC3463] introduced Enhanced Mail System Status Codes,\
    \ and [RFC5248]\n   created an IANA registry for these.\n   [RFC6376] and [RFC7208]\
    \ introduced, respectively, DomainKeys\n   Identified Mail (DKIM) and Sender Policy\
    \ Framework (SPF), two\n   protocols for conducting message authentication.  Another\
    \ common\n   email acceptance test is the reverse Domain Name System (DNS) check\n\
    \   on an email client's IP address, as described in Section 3 of\n   [RFC7001].\n\
    \   The current set of enhanced status codes does not include any code\n   for\
    \ indicating that a message is being rejected or deferred due to\n   local policy\
    \ reasons related to any of these mechanisms.  This is\n   potentially useful\
    \ information to agents that need more than\n   rudimentary handling information\
    \ about the reason a message was\n   rejected on receipt.  This document introduces\
    \ enhanced status codes\n   for reporting those cases to clients.\n   Section\
    \ 3.2 updates [RFC7208], as new enhanced status codes relevant\n   to that specification\
    \ are being registered and recommended for use.\n"

- title: 4.  General Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  General Considerations\n   By the nature of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol\
    \ (SMTP), only one\n   enhanced status code can be returned for a given exchange\
    \ between\n   client and server.  However, an operator might decide to defer or\n\
    \   reject a message for a plurality of reasons.  Clients receiving these\n  \
    \ codes need to consider that the failure reflected by one of these\n   status\
    \ codes might not reflect the only reason, or the most important\n   reason, for\
    \ non-acceptance of the message or command.\n   It is important to note that Section\
    \ 6.1 of [RFC6376] discourages\n   special treatment of messages bearing no valid\
    \ DKIM signature.  There\n   are some operators that disregard this advice, a\
    \ few of which go so\n   far as to require a valid Author Domain Signature (that\
    \ is, one\n   matching the domain(s) in the From header field) in order to accept\n\
    \   the message.  Moreover, some nascent technologies built atop SPF and\n   DKIM\
    \ depend on such authentications.  This work does not endorse\n   configurations\
    \ that violate DKIM's recommendations but rather\n   acknowledges that they do\
    \ exist and merely seeks to provide for\n   improved interoperability with such\
    \ operators.\n   A specific use case for these codes is mailing list software,\
    \ which\n   processes rejections in order to remove from the subscriber set those\n\
    \   addresses that are no longer valid.  There is a need in that case to\n   distinguish\
    \ authentication failures from indications that the\n   recipient address is no\
    \ longer valid.\n   If a receiving server performs multiple authentication checks\
    \ and\n   more than one of them fails, thus warranting rejection of the\n   message,\
    \ the SMTP server SHOULD use the code that indicates multiple\n   methods failed\
    \ rather than only reporting the first one that failed.\n   It may be the case\
    \ that one method is always expected to fail; thus,\n   returning that method's\
    \ specific code is not information useful to\n   the sending agent.\n   The reverse\
    \ IP DNS check is defined in Section 3 of [RFC7001].\n   Any message authentication\
    \ or policy enforcement technologies\n   developed in the future should also include\
    \ registration of their own\n   enhanced status codes so that this kind of specific\
    \ reporting is\n   available to operators that wish to use them.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Use of these codes reveals local policy with\
    \ respect to email\n   authentication, which can be useful information to actors\
    \ attempting\n   to deliver undesired mail.  It should be noted that there is\
    \ no\n   specific obligation to use these codes; if an operator wishes not to\n\
    \   reveal this aspect of local policy, it can continue using a generic\n   result\
    \ code such as 5.7.7, 5.7.1, or even 5.7.0.\n"
