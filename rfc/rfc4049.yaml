  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies a new ASN.1 [ASN1] type for representing\n\
    \   time:  BinaryTime.  This ASN.1 type can be used to represent date and\n  \
    \ time values.\n   This document also specifies an alternative to the signing-time\n\
    \   attribute used with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [CMS]\n   SignedData\
    \ and AuthenticatedData content types, allowing the\n   BinaryTime type to be\
    \ used instead of the traditional UTCTime and\n   GeneralizedTime types.\n"
- title: 1.1.  BinaryTime
  contents:
  - "1.1.  BinaryTime\n   Many operating systems represent date and time as an integer.\
    \  This\n   document specifies an ASN.1 type for representing date and time in\
    \ a\n   manner that is also an integer.  Although some conversion may be\n   necessary\
    \ due to the selection of a different epoch or a different\n   granularity, an\
    \ integer representation has several advantages over\n   the UTCTime and GeneralizedTime\
    \ types.\n   First, a BinaryTime value is smaller than either a UTCTime or a\n\
    \   GeneralizedTime value.\n   Second, in some operating systems, the value can\
    \ be used with little\n   or no conversion.  Conversion, when it is needed, requires\
    \ only\n   straightforward computation.  If the endian ordering is different\n\
    \   from the ASN.1 representation of an INTEGER, then straightforward\n   manipulation\
    \ is needed to obtain an equivalent integer value.  If the\n   epoch is different\
    \ than the one chosen for BinaryTime, addition or\n   subtraction is needed to\
    \ compensate.  If the granularity is something\n   other than seconds, then multiplication\
    \ or division is needed to\n   compensate.  Also, padding may be needed to convert\
    \ the variable-\n   length ASN.1 encoding of INTEGER to a fixed-length value used\
    \ in the\n   operating system.\n   Third, date comparison is very easy with BinaryTime.\
    \  Integer\n   comparison is easy, even when multi-precision integers are involved.\n\
    \   Date comparison with UTCTime or GeneralizedTime can be complex when\n   the\
    \ two values to be compared are provided in different time zones.\n   This is\
    \ a rare instance which both memory and processor cycles can be\n   saved.\n"

- title: 2.  BinaryTime Definition
  contents:
  - "2.  BinaryTime Definition\n   The BinaryTime ASN.1 type is used to represent\
    \ an absolute time and\n   date.  A positive integer value is used to represent\
    \ time values\n   based on coordinated universal time (UTC), which is also called\n\
    \   Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and ZULU clock time.\n   The syntax for BinaryTime\
    \ is:\n      BinaryTime ::= INTEGER (0..MAX)\n   The integer value is the number\
    \ of seconds, excluding leap seconds,\n   after midnight UTC, January 1, 1970.\
    \  This time format cannot\n   represent time values prior to January 1, 1970.\
    \  The latest UTC time\n   value that can be represented by a four-octet integer\
    \ value is\n   03:14:07 on January 19, 2038, which is represented by the hexadecimal\n\
    \   value 7FFFFFFF.  Time values beyond 03:14:07 on January 19, 2038, are\n  \
    \ represented by integer values that are longer than four octets, and a\n   five-octet\
    \ integer value is sufficient to represent dates covering\n   the next seventeen\
    \ millennia.\n   This specification uses a variable-length encoding of INTEGER.\
    \  This\n   permits any time value after midnight UTC, January 1, 1970, to be\n\
    \   represented.\n   When encoding an integer value that consists of more than\
    \ one octet,\n   which includes almost all the time values of interest, the bits\
    \ of\n   the first octet and bit 8 of the second octet MUST NOT all be ones or\n\
    \   all zeros.  This rule ensures that an integer value is always encoded\n  \
    \ in the smallest possible number of octets.  However, it means that\n   implementations\
    \ cannot assume a fixed length for the integer value.\n"
- title: 3.  Binary Signing Time Attribute Definition
  contents:
  - "3.  Binary Signing Time Attribute Definition\n   The binary-signing-time attribute\
    \ type specifies the time at which\n   the signer (purportedly) performed the\
    \ signing process.  The binary-\n   signing-time attribute type is intended for\
    \ use in the CMS SignedData\n   content type; however, the attribute can also\
    \ be used with the\n   AuthenticatedData content type.\n   The binary-signing-time\
    \ attribute MUST be a signed attribute or an\n   authenticated attribute; it MUST\
    \ NOT be an unsigned attribute,\n   unauthenticated attribute, or unprotected\
    \ attribute.\n   The following object identifier identifies the binary-signing-time\n\
    \   attribute:\n      id-aa-binarySigningTime OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1)\n\

    \ BinarySigningTime:\n      BinarySigningTime ::= BinaryTime\n   In [CMS], the\
    \ SignedAttributes syntax and the AuthAttributes syntax\n   are each defined as\
    \ a SET OF Attributes.  However, the binary-\n   signing-time attribute MUST have\
    \ a single attribute value, even\n   though the syntax is defined as a SET OF\
    \ AttributeValue.  There MUST\n   NOT be zero or multiple instances of AttributeValue\
    \ present.\n   The SignedAttributes contained in the signerInfo structure within\n\
    \   SignedData MUST NOT include multiple instances of the binary-\n   signing-time\
    \ attribute.  Similarly, the AuthAttributes in an\n   AuthenticatedData MUST NOT\
    \ include multiple instances of the binary-\n   signing-time attribute.\n   No\
    \ requirement is imposed concerning the correctness of the signing\n   time itself,\
    \ and acceptance of a purported signing time is a matter\n   of a recipient's\
    \ discretion.  It is expected, however, that some\n   signers, such as time-stamp\
    \ servers, will be trusted implicitly.\n"
