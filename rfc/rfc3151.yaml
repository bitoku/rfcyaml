  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a URN (Uniform Resource Name) namespace\
    \ that\n   is designed to allow Public Identifiers to be expressed in URI\n  \
    \ (Uniform Resource Identifiers) syntax.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   XML [1] external entities have two identifiers: a system\
    \ identifier\n   and a public identifier.  The system identifier is a URI, by\n\
    \   definition, but the public identifier is simply a string.\n   Historically,\
    \ the system identifier of an external entity has been a\n   local, or system-specific\
    \ identifier while the public identifier has\n   been a more global, persistent\
    \ name.\n   Unfortunately, public identifiers do not fit neatly into the existing\n\
    \   web architecture because they are not legal URIs.  Many new\n   specifications\
    \ (XSLT, XML Schema, etc.) have the implicit or explicit\n   requirement that\
    \ all external identifiers be URIs.\n   The purpose of this namespace is to allow\
    \ public identifiers to be\n   encoded in URNs in a reliable, comparable way.\n\
    \   This document describes a scheme for representing public identifiers\n   as\
    \ URNs by introducing a public identifier namespace, \"publicid\".\n   This namespace\
    \ specification is for a formal namespace.\n"
- title: 1.1 Public Identifiers
  contents:
  - "1.1 Public Identifiers\n   Any string which consists only of the public identifier\
    \ characters\n   (defined by Production 13 of Extensible Markup Language (XML)\
    \ 1.0\n   Second Edition [1]) is a legal public identifier.\n   In addition to\
    \ the character set restriction, public identifiers must\n   be normalized by\
    \ changing all strings of whitespace (the characters\n   #x20, #x9, #xD, and #xA)\
    \ to single space characters (#x20), and\n   removing all leading and trailing\
    \ whitespace.\n   In keeping with this specification's goal of allowing public\n\
    \   identifiers to be encoded in a reliable, comparable way, this\n   specification\
    \ mandates that public identifiers be normalized before\n   encoding them into\
    \ URNs.  Throughout this specification, we assume\n   that normalization has already\
    \ been performed.\n"
- title: 1.2 Formal Public Identifiers
  contents:
  - "1.2 Formal Public Identifiers\n   SGML [2] defines a restricted subset of public\
    \ identifier called a\n   \"Formal Public Identifier\" (FPI).\n   FPIs are strings\
    \ composed from the same range of characters as public\n   identifiers, but with\
    \ an explicit internal structure.  The structure\n   of Formal Public Identifiers\
    \ is normatively described in SGML [2]; we\n   review it here for convenience.\n\
    \   Most Formal Public Identifiers consist of the following fields, in\n   this\
    \ order: an owner identifier, a public text class, a public text\n   description,\
    \ a public text language or public text designating\n   sequence, and an optional\
    \ public text display version.\n   Owner identifiers may begin with \"-//\" or\
    \ \"+//\"; otherwise \"//\" is\n   used to delimit fields in the FPI (with the\
    \ exception of the public\n   text class which is delimited from the public text\
    \ description by a\n   space).\n   In other words, most FPIs look like this:\n\
    \      owner//class description//language//version\n   and most owners begin with\
    \ \"+//\" or \"-//\", although they are not\n   required to.  Here are some example\
    \ FPIs:\n   +//IDN python.org//DTD XML Bookmark Exchange Language 1.0//EN//XML\n\
    \   -//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2//EN\n   -//ArborText::prod//DTD Help Navigation\
    \ Document::19970708//EN\n   ISO/IEC 10179:1996//DTD DSSSL Architecture//EN\n\
    \   ISO 8879:1986//ENTITIES Added Latin 1//EN\n   This document describes an algorithm\
    \ for encoding public identifiers\n   into URNs that explicitly allows the structured\
    \ nature of formal\n   public identifiers to be preserved.  However, an algorithm\
    \ for\n   correctly identifying a Formal Public Identifier and determining the\n\
    \   various fields within it is out of scope for this document and not\n   necessary\
    \ for the implementation of this URN namespace.\n"

    \      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) for URNs in the \"publicid\"\n    \
    \  namespace has the following structure:\n         urn:publicid:{transcribed-public-identifier}\n\
    \      Where:\n            {transcribed-public-identifier} is the text of the\
    \ public\n            identifier transcribed according to the following rules:\n\
    \               -  A space in the public identifier is transcribed as\n      \
    \            \"+\".  Whitespace normalization must be performed\n            \
    \      before constructing a URN in the \"publicid\" namespace,\n            \
    \      therefore adjacent \"+\" characters never occur in URNs\n             \
    \     in this namespace.\n               -  The sequence of characters \"//\"\
    \ is transcribed as \":\".\n               -  The sequence of characters \"::\"\
    \ is transcribed as \";\".\n               -  A literal \"+\" character is transcribed\
    \ as \"%2B\".\n               -  A literal \":\" character (except in \"::\")\
    \ is\n                  transcribed as \"%3A\".\n               -  A literal \"\
    /\" character (except in \"//\") is\n                  transcribed as \"%2F\"\
    .\n               -  A literal \";\" character is transcribed as \"%3B\".\n  \
    \             -  A literal \"'\" character is transcribed as \"%27\".\n      \
    \         -  A literal \"?\" character is transcribed as \"%3F\".\n          \
    \     -  A literal \"#\" character is transcribed as \"%23\".\n              \
    \ -  A literal \"%\" character is transcribed as \"%25\".\n   The special rules\
    \ for \"//\" and \"::\" are designed to preserve the\n   structured nature of\
    \ formal public identifiers without requiring the\n   translator to have special\
    \ knowledge of FPI syntax.\n   The rules for \"+\", \":\", \"/\", and \";\" are\
    \ required to preserve literal\n   occurrences of these characters in the 'publicid'\
    \ URN namespace.\n   The remaining characters, \" \" (space), \"'\", \"?\", \"\
    #\", and \"%\", are\n   the only other legal characters in public identifiers\
    \ that cannot be\n   literally transcribed into a URN by the rules of RFC 2141\
    \ [4] and RFC\n   2396 [5].\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n      Extensible\
    \ Markup Language (XML) Version 1.0 Second Edition [1]\n      Standard Generalized\
    \ Markup Language (SGML) [2]\n      Registration procedures for public text owner\
    \ identifiers [3]\n   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n      The identifier\
    \ uniqueness considerations for URNs in the\n      \"publicid\" namespace are\
    \ the same as the identifier uniqueness\n      considerations for public identifiers.\
    \  Formal Public Identifiers\n      with registered owner identifiers are required\
    \ to be unique.  For\n      unregistered owner identifiers and informal public\
    \ identifiers,\n      they may or may not be unique.  No enforcement policy can\
    \ be\n      asserted.\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n      The persistence\
    \ of URNs in the \"publicid\" namespace is the same as\n      the persistence\
    \ of the corresponding public identifier.\n      The \"publicid\" namespace is\
    \ available for a wide range of uses; it\n      cannot be subjected to a uniform\
    \ persistence policy.  As a general\n      rule, formal public identifiers with\
    \ registered owner identifiers\n      are more likely to be persistent than informal\
    \ public identifiers\n      or formal public identifiers with unregistered owner\
    \ identifiers.\n      One exception to this rule is the \"IDN\" scheme for producing\
    \ a\n      registered owner identifier from a domain name.  That scheme\n    \
    \  contains at least all the weaknesses associated with the\n      persistence\
    \ of domain names.\n      It is important to note that a properly registered owner\n\
    \      identifier can apply any policy desired to the portion of the\n      \"\
    publicid\" URN namespace identified by that owner identifier.\n   Process of identifier\
    \ assignment:\n      Identifiers in the \"publicid\" namespace are assigned by\
    \ applying\n      the conversions described above to a public identifier.  In\
    \ order\n      to provide a URN in this namespace for a resource that does not\n\
    \      have a public identifier, one must be created (according to the\n     \
    \ rules for creating public identifiers).\n      There is no requirement that\
    \ a resource have only one public\n      identifier.\n   Process of identifier\
    \ resolution:\n      Identifiers in the \"publicid\" namespace may be resolved\
    \ by the\n      same policies and procedures as public identifiers.  Public\n\
    \      identifiers can be resolved in many different ways.  Many existing\n  \
    \    systems provide facilities for resolving them by way of OASIS\n      TR9401\
    \ [6] Catalog files.  Other systems resolve them by mapping\n      each component\
    \ to a local pathname component.  And some systems\n      simply \"know about\"\
    \ a fixed set of public identifiers.  In\n      addition, URNs in the 'publicid'\
    \ namespace may be resolvable by\n      other mechanisms unique to URIs (such\
    \ as caches).\n   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n      Whitespace normalization\
    \ is performed before constructing a URN in\n      the \"publicid\" namespace,\
    \ so URNs are lexically equivalent if and\n      only if they are lexically identical.\n\
    \   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n      No special considerations.  URNs in this\
    \ namespace conform to both\n      RFC 2141 and RFC 2396.\n   Validation mechanism:\n\
    \      None specified.\n   Scope:\n      Global\n"
