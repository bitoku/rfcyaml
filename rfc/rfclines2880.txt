This document describes how to map Group 3 fax capability identification bits, described in ITU T.30 [6], into the Internet fax feature schema described in "Content feature schema for Internet fax" [4].
This is a companion to the fax feature schema document [4], which itself defines a profile of the media feature registration mechanisms [1,2,3], for use in performing capability identification between extended Internet fax systems [5].
1.1 Organization of this document Section 2 introduces the mechanisms that combine feature tag constraints to describe complex recipient capabilities.
Section 3 surveys Group 3 fax (T.30) capability bits that relate to media handling capabilities.
Section 4 describes the dependencies between Group 3 fax (T.30) capability bits.
These are presented in a decision table format [16] with descriptive text in place of the action bodies.
Section 5 describes a formal mechanism for converting Group 3 fax (T.30) capability masks to fax feature schema statements.
The conversion process is driven by the decision tables introduced previously, using fax feature schema statements and combining rules in the action bodies.
Section 6 presents an example of a Group 3 fax (T.30) capability mask, and uses the formal mechanism described previously to convert that into a corresponding fax feature schema statement.

Combining feature tags A fax document can be described by media features.
Any single media feature value can be thought of as just one component of a feature collection that describes some instance of a document (e.g.  a printed fax, a displayed image, etc.).
Such a feature collection consists of a number of media feature tags (each per [1]) and associated feature values.
A feature set contains a number of feature collections.
Thus, a feature set can describe a number of different fax document instances.
These can correspond to different treatments of a single document (e.g. different resolutions used for printing a given fax), a number of different documents subjected to a common treatment (e.g. the range of different images that can be rendered on a given display), or some combination of these (see examples below).
Thus, a description of a feature set can describe the rendering requirements of a fax document or the capabilities of a receiving eifax system.
2.1 Relationship to Group 3 fax A "feature tag" can be compared with a single bit in a T.30 DCS frame, describing a specific attribute of a specific fax document.
A "feature collection" corresponds to a complete T.30 DCS frame, describing a range of attributes of a specific fax document.
A "feature set" corresponds to a DIS or DTC frame, describing the range of document attributes that can be accepted by a given fax machine.
Within T.30 DIS/DTC frames, dependencies between the various capabilities are implicit in the definitions of the capabilities.
E.g. multi level coding (DIS/DTC bit 68) requires support for 200 200dpi resolution (DIS/DTC bit 15).
In the feature set description framework used by eifax systems [1,2,3,4] such dependencies between different features are expressed explicitly.
Later sections of this memo describe how the implicit dependencies of T.30 are expressed using the media feature set notation.
The general approach to describing feature sets, described more fully in [2], is to use functions ("predicates") that, when applied to a feature collection value, yield a Boolean value that is TRUE if the feature collection describes an acceptable fax document instance, otherwise FALSE.
In the examples below the following notation is used: (x ?
x' for some relationship with value 'y'.
represents the logical AND of predicates 'p1', 'p2' up to 'pn'.
The following expression uses the syntax of [2] to describe a data resource that can be displayed either: (a)  as a 750x500 pixel image using 15 colours, or (b)  at 150dpi on an A4 page.
The following expression describes a receiving system that has: (a)  a screen capable of displaying 640 480 pixels and 16 million colours (24 bits per pixel), 800 600 pixels and 64 thousand colours (16 bits per pixel) or 1024 768 pixels and 256 colours (8 bits per pixel), or (b)  a printer capable of rendering 300dpi on A4 paper.

Survey of media related T.30 capability bits
The following sections refer to T.30 DIS/DTC bits identified and described in Table 2/T.30 and accompanying notes [6].
Bit numbers that are not referenced below are considered to be not related to media features, hence not relevant to the Internet fax feature schema.
some of the DIS/DTC bits identified below are documented in revisions of the T.30 specification that may be not yet publicly available from the ITU.
All Group 3 fax systems are required to support a basic resolution of 200 100dpi (dots per inch) or 8 3.85dpmm (dots per millimetre).
Setting this bit indicates additional support for 200 200dpi or 8 7.7dpmm.
For multi level images, 200 200dpi is the basic resolution, and this bit must be set.
The other basic resolution options apply to bi  level images only.
All Group 3 fax systems are required to support Modified Huffman (MH) 1 dimensional coding for bi level images.
(A bi level image is one with just two pixel states such as black and white, as opposed to a grey scale or colour image.)
Setting this bit indicates additional support for Modified Read (MR) 2 dimensional coding for bi level images.
Both MH and MR coding are described in ITU T.4 [7].
3.3 DIS/DTC bits 17,18 (width)
All Group 3 fax systems are required to support 215mm paper width.
These bits can be set to indicate additional support for 255mm and 303mm paper widths.
3.4 DIS/DTC bits 19,20 (length)
All Group 3 fax systems are required to support 297mm paper length.
These bits can be set to indicate additional support for 364mm and unlimited paper lengths.
Setting this bit indicates support for Modified Modified Read (MMR)
2 dimensional coding for bi level images, in addition to the required support for MH coding.
MMR coding is described in ITU T.6 [8].
3.6 DIS/DTC bit 36 (JBIG multi level coding)
If multi level images are to be handled, support for JPEG coding is required (i.e. bit 68 must be set).
Setting bit 36 indicates additional support for JBIG lossless coding of multi level images.
JBIG coding for multi level images is described in ITU T.43 [10] and T.4 Annex G [7].
3.7 DIS/DTC bit 37 (plane interleave)
Setting this bit indicates support for plane interleave for JBIG  coded multi level images in addition to stripe interleave, which is standard for JBIG multi level images.
JBIG coding for multi level images is described in ITU T.43 [10] and T.4 Annex G [7].
3.8 DIS/DTC bits 41,42,43 (resolution)
Setting these bits indicates support for resolutions in addition to 200 100dpi and 200 200dpi, or 8 3.85dpmm and
(Or in addition to the basic 200 200dpi resolution when using a multi level image mode.)
Bit 41 indicates support for 8 15.4dpmm bi level images (independently of the settings of bits 44 and 45).
Bit 42 indicates support for 300 300dpi bi level images (independently of the settings of bits 44 and 45).
Also applies to multi level images or MRC mask if bit 97 is set.
Bit 43 indicates support for 400 400dpi
and/or 16 15.4dpmm bi level images, depending upon the settings of bits 44 and 45.
Also applies to multi level images or MRC mask if bit 97 is set.
See also: bits 15,44,45,97. 3.9 DIS/DTC bits
These bits are used to indicate the preferred resolution units for received images.
Because the exact resolution and x/y pixel density measures in dpi or dpmm are slightly different,
some image size and aspect ratio distortion may occur if the sender and receiver use different units.
Even when sender and recipient have different preferred units, image transfer must be accomplished.
For most fax uses, the dpi and dpmm measurements are sufficiently close to each other that the difference is not noticed.
The preferred units setting affects the detailed interpretation of the following resolutions:
204 98 Bit 15    200 200
196 Bit 43    400 400
But terminals are required to accept the inch  and metric based measures given above as equivalent, distorting the image if necessary to accommodate the differences.
See also: bits 15, 43 3.10
This bit indicates support for JPEG coding of multi level images.
JPEG coding for multi level images is described in ITU T.81 [12] and T.4 Annex E [7].
This bit indicates support for colour images, in addition to just grey scale.
Both grey scale and colour require multi level coding.
The difference is that grey is single component while colour is multi  component.
71 (bits/sample) Standard support for multi level images uses 8 bits per sample.
Setting this bit indicates additional support for 12 bits per sample.
For a grey scale multi level image, there is just one sample per pixel, giving 256 or 4096 possible pixel values.
For a full colour multi level image there are three samples per pixel, giving 256^3 (16777216) or 4096^
When related to a mapped colour image, bit 71 also affects the maximum number of entries in the mapping table:  when it is reset, up to 4096 different pixel values can be used;  when set, up to 65536 different values can be used.
Standard support for JPEG coded multi level images uses 4:1:1 chrominance subsampling.
That is, for each 4 luminance samples in the image data there is a single chrominance sample.
Setting this bit indicates that JPEG coded colour images without subsampling can also be supported.
This is not applicable to JBIG coding (bit 36).
Standard support for multi level images requires use of D50 illuminant.
Setting this bit indicates that a custom illuminant also can be supported for multi level images (both grey scale and colour).
Details of the custom illuminant are contained in the image data.
Use of a custom illuminant with multi level images is described in ITU T.4 Annex E [7].
Standard support for a default colour gamut is required for multi  level images.
Setting this bit indicates that a custom gamut also can be supported for multi level images (both grey scale and colour).
Details of the custom gamut are contained in the image data.
All Group 3 faxes are required to support A4 paper size.
These bits can be set to indicate additional support for North American letter and legal paper sizes.
Setting bit 78 indicates support for JBIG coding of bi level images (using T.85 encoding rules), in addition to the required support for MH coding.
JBIG coding of bi level images is described in ITU T.85 [14].
3.18 DIS/DTC bit 79 (JBIG stripe size)
Setting bit 79 (along with bit 78) indicates support for the 'LO' option with JBIG coded bi level images.
Basic bi level JBIG coding uses 128 lines per stripe;  the 'LO' option allows other stripe sizes to be used.
The stripe size is used for all stripes except the last, which may have fewer lines than the indicated value.
JBIG coding of bi level images is described in ITU T.85 [14].
3.19 DIS/DTC bit 92,93,94 (MRC maximum functional mode)
If these bits are all zero, then Mixed Raster Content (MRC) coding is not supported.
Otherwise, they represent a number in the range 1 7 that indicates an MRC maximum functional mode.
MRC coding of images is described in ITU T.44 [11] and T.4 Annex H [17].
3.20 DIS/DTC bit 95 (MRC stripe size)
Standard support for MRC uses a maximum stripe size of 256 lines.
When this bit is set, the maximum stripe size is a full page.
This bit is meaningful only if bits 92 94 indicate an MRC coding capability.
MRC coding of images is described in ITU T.44 [11] and T.4 Annex H [17].
3.21 DIS/DTC bit 97 (resolution)
Setting this bit indicates that the additional resolutions indicated by bits 42 and 43 may be used for multi level images and any MRC mask layer.
When this bit is set, bit 42 implies 300dpi and bit 43 implies 400dpi for multi level or MRC mask layer images (irrespective of the preferred units indicated by bits 44 and 45).
3.22 DIS/DTC bit 98 (resolution)
Setting this bit indicates that the additional resolution 100 100dpi may be used for multi level images.
100dpi is not used for bi level images, including the MRC mask layer.
See also: bit 36,68,92 94.
Summary of T.30 capability dependencies
This section contains a number of decision tables that indicate the allowable combinations of T.30 DIS/DTC mask bits.
Within the decision table bodies, the following symbols are use to indicate values of T.30 DIS/DTC bits: 0    bit set to '0' 1    bit set to '1' x    don't care bit value: may be '0' or '1'
0   bit must be '0' ('1' is invalid in given combination)
1   bit must be '1' ('0' is invalid in given combination)

Bi level codes are used for the mask layer.
T.30 bits   15 92 93 94 95
8 3.85dpmm is required in all cases for Group 3 fax conformance.
For multi  level coders (colour/grey) and MRC mask layers
the base resolution is 200 200dpi (i.e. bit 15 must be set).
When multi level coders (JPEG or T.43) or MRC are used, only inch  based square resolutions are available.
However, the base non square resolution (i.e. 200x100dpi or 8x3.85dpmm) must still be available as a capability for use with the mandatory bi level coder (MH).
Hence, any references to metric and non square resolutions in the table below apply only to bi level coders.
When describing MRC capabilities, the complete set of usable resolutions is listed.
However, there are some restrictions on their use:  (a)
100dpi resolution can be used only with multi level images, and (b) any multi level image resolution is required to be an integral sub multiple of the applicable mask resolution.
In the following table: dpi    dots per inch dpmm   dots per millimetre Preferred resolutions are indicated here, even though inch  or mm  based units must be accepted, according to the T.30 protocol [6].
8 3.85dpmm or 16 15.4dpmm 0
Also supports 8 15.4dpmm (bi level only)
4.3 Colour capabilities Bit 68 (JPEG) is required for any colour/grey scale mode, and bit 36 indicates additional T.43 capability.

Mapping T.30 capabilities to fax feature schema This section follows the structure of the previous section, except that the decision tables are restated with feature set expression mappings in the action stub.
The feature set expressions use media feature tags presented in "Content feature schema for Internet fax" [4].
To construct a feature set expression corresponding to a collection of DIS frame bits:  Compare the DIS bits with each decision table in the following sections (5.1 to 5.4).
Some decision tables consist of a number of sub tables separated by horizontal lines.
The DIS bits will match exactly one row from each table or sub  table:  collect the corresponding feature set expression from the action stub (the right hand column of the table).
In the case of the table in section 5.2, which consists of several sub tables, combine the feature set expressions from each sub table with a logical OR:
In this way, a single feature set expression is obtained for the table.
T513 T52 T53 T54 )
the feature set expression obtained from the table in section 5.1.1 T512 is obtained from the table in section 5.1.2 T513 is obtained from the table in section
5.1.3 T52 is obtained from the table in section 5.2 T53 is obtained from the table in section
5.3 T54 is obtained from the table in section 5.4
The resulting expression is the feature set expression corresponding to the DIS bits given.
Remember that there may be other capabilities not expressed by the DIS bits that should be incorporated into the final feature expression (e.g. TIFF image file structure).
To do the reverse transformation, match the feature set to each row of each decision table using the matching algorithm in RFC 2533 [2], and OR together the DIS bit masks for each row whose feature set expression is completely contained by (i.e. is a subset of) that given (where the bit value in a table is '

Although motivated by the requirements of eifax [5], this document is concerned with describing capabilities of Group 3 fax systems [6].
As such, the algorithms do not of themselves create equivalent Internet fax capability statements but, rather, they construct capability expressions that might be incorporated into those for eifax systems.
This point is illustrated at the end of the first example below where subsection 6.1.1 has been added, which combines T.30 capabilities with an appropriate TIFF file format capability to yield an expression that might be used to describe an Internet fax system.
6.1 Common black and white fax machine DIS/

subsampling (1:1:1):  not supported  0 74
Custom gamut range:  not supported
Multi level resolution 300x300dpi or    0
not supported Following the procedure in section 5, matching these DIS bits against the decision tables in sections 5.1 to 5.4, we get:
(& (color binary) (image coding [MH,MR,MMR]) )
no capabilities [Bits 68,98   0,0]
no capabilities [Bits 68,71   0,0]
no capabilities [Bits 68,74   0,0]
no capabilities [Bits 68,75   0,0]
no capability constraint [Bits 76,77   1,0]
Combining these as indicated in section 5, we get the following.
(The initial expression is constructed verbatim per the rules in the first part of section 5, even though it contains some redundancy.)
This in turn is simplified as follows.

Security Considerations Security considerations are discussed in the fax feature schema description [4].
This memo is not believed to introduce any additional security concerns.
