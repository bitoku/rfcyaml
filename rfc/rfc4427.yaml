- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines a common terminology for Generalized\
    \ Multi-\n   Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)-based recovery mechanisms (i.e.,\n\
    \   protection and restoration).\n   The terminology proposed in this document\
    \ is independent of the\n   underlying transport technologies and borrows from\
    \ the G.808.1 ITU-T\n   Recommendation [G.808.1] and from the G.841 ITU-T Recommendation\n\
    \   [G.841].  The restoration terminology and concepts have been gathered\n  \
    \ from numerous sources including IETF documents.\n   In the context of this document,\
    \ the term \"recovery\" denotes both\n   protection and restoration.  The specific\
    \ terms \"protection\" and\n   \"restoration\" will only be used when differentiation\
    \ is required.\n   This document focuses on the terminology for the recovery of\
    \ Label\n   Switched Paths (LSPs) controlled by a GMPLS control plane.  The\n\
    \   proposed terminology applies to end-to-end, segment, and span (i.e.,\n   link)\
    \ recovery.  Note that the terminology for recovery of the\n   control plane itself\
    \ is not in the scope of this document.\n   Protection and restoration of switched\
    \ LSPs under tight time\n   constraints is a challenging problem.  This is particularly\
    \ relevant\n   to optical networks that consist of Time Division Multiplex (TDM)\n\
    \   and/or all-optical (photonic) cross-connects referred to as GMPLS\n   nodes\
    \ (or simply nodes, or even sometimes \"Label Switching Routers,\n   or LSRs\"\
    ) connected in a general topology [RFC3945].\n   Recovery typically involves the\
    \ activation of a recovery (or\n   alternate) LSP when a failure is encountered\
    \ in the working LSP.\n   A working or recovery LSP is characterized by an ingress\
    \ interface,\n   an egress interface, and a set of intermediate nodes and spans\n\
    \   through which the LSP is routed.  The working and recovery LSPs are\n   typically\
    \ resource disjoint (e.g., node and/or span disjoint).  This\n   ensures that\
    \ a single failure will not affect both the working and\n   recovery LSPs.\n \
    \  A bi-directional span between neighboring nodes is usually realized\n   as\
    \ a pair of unidirectional spans.  Therefore, the end-to-end path\n   for a bi-directional\
    \ LSP consists of a series of bi-directional\n   segments (i.e., Sub-Network Connections,\
    \ or SNCs, in the ITU-T\n   terminology) between the source and destination nodes,\
    \ traversing\n   intermediate nodes.\n"

- title: 4.  Recovery Terminology Common to Protection and Restoration
  contents:
  - "4.  Recovery Terminology Common to Protection and Restoration\n   This section\
    \ defines the following general terms common to both\n   protection and restoration\
    \ (i.e., recovery).  In addition, most of\n   these terms apply to end-to-end,\
    \ segment, and span LSP recovery.\n   Note that span recovery does not protect\
    \ the nodes at each end of the\n   span, otherwise end-to-end or segment LSP recovery\
    \ should be used.\n   The terminology and the definitions were originally taken\
    \ from\n   [G.808.1].  However, for generalization, the following language,\n\
    \   which is not directly related to recovery, has been adapted to GMPLS\n   and\
    \ the common IETF terminology:\n   An LSP is used as a generic term to designate\
    \ either an SNC (Sub-\n   Network Connection) or an NC (Network Connection) in\
    \ ITU-T\n   terminology.  The ITU-T uses the term transport entity to designate\n\
    \   either a link, an SNC, or an NC.  The term \"Traffic\" is used instead\n \
    \  of \"Traffic Signal\".  The term protection or restoration \"scheme\" is\n\
    \   used instead of protection or restoration \"architecture\".\n   The reader\
    \ is invited to read [G.841] and [G.808.1] for references to\n   SDH protection\
    \ and Generic Protection Switching terminology,\n   respectively.  Note that restoration\
    \ is not in the scope of\n   [G.808.1].\n"
- title: 4.1.  Working and Recovery LSP/Span
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Working and Recovery LSP/Span\n   A working LSP/span is an LSP/span transporting\
    \ \"normal\" user traffic.\n   A recovery LSP/span is an LSP/span used to transport\
    \ \"normal\" user\n   traffic when the working LSP/span fails.  Additionally,\
    \ the recovery\n   LSP/span may transport \"extra\" user traffic (i.e., pre-emptable\n\
    \   traffic) when normal traffic is carried over the working LSP/span.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Traffic Types
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Traffic Types\n   The different types of traffic that can be transported\
    \ over an\n   LSP/span, in the context of this document, are defined hereafter:\n\
    \   A. Normal traffic:\n   User traffic that may be protected by two alternative\
    \ LSPs/spans (the\n   working and recovery LSPs/spans).\n   B. Extra traffic:\n\
    \   User traffic carried over recovery resources (e.g., a recovery\n   LSP/span)\
    \ when these resources are not being used for the recovery of\n   normal traffic\
    \ (i.e., when the recovery resources are in standby\n   mode).  When the recovery\
    \ resources are required to recover normal\n   traffic from the failed working\
    \ LSP/span, the extra traffic is pre-\n   empted.  Extra traffic is not protected\
    \ by definition, but may be\n   restored.  Moreover, extra traffic does not need\
    \ to commence or be\n   terminated at the ends of the LSPs/spans that it uses.\n\
    \   C. Null traffic:\n   Traffic carried over the recovery LSP/span if it is not\
    \ used to carry\n   normal or extra traffic.  Null traffic can be any kind of\
    \ traffic\n   that conforms to the signal structure of the specific layer, and\
    \ it\n   is ignored (not selected) at the egress of the recovery LSP/span.\n"
- title: 4.3.  LSP/Span Protection and Restoration
  contents:
  - "4.3.  LSP/Span Protection and Restoration\n   The following subtle distinction\
    \ is generally made between the terms\n   \"protection\" and \"restoration\",\
    \ even though these terms are often\n   used interchangeably [RFC3386].\n   The\
    \ distinction between protection and restoration is made based on\n   the resource\
    \ allocation done during the recovery LSP/span\n   establishment.  The distinction\
    \ between different types of\n   restoration is made based on the level of route\
    \ computation,\n   signaling, and resource allocation during the restoration LSP/span\n\
    \   establishment.\n   A. LSP/Span Protection\n   LSP/span protection denotes\
    \ the paradigm whereby one or more\n   dedicated protection LSP(s)/span(s) is/are\
    \ fully established to\n   protect one or more working LSP(s)/span(s).\n   For\
    \ a protection LSP, this implies that route computation took place,\n   that the\
    \ LSP was fully signaled all the way, and that its resources\n   were fully selected\
    \ (i.e., allocated) and cross-connected between the\n   ingress and egress nodes.\n\
    \   For a protection span, this implies that the span has been selected\n   and\
    \ reserved for protection.\n   Indeed, it means that no signaling takes place\
    \ to establish the\n   protection LSP/span when a failure occurs.  However, various\
    \ other\n   kinds of signaling may take place between the ingress and egress\n\
    \   nodes for fault notification, to synchronize their use of the\n   protection\
    \ LSP/span, for reversion, etc.\n   B. LSP/Span Restoration\n   LSP/span restoration\
    \ denotes the paradigm whereby some restoration\n   resources may be pre-computed,\
    \ signaled, and selected a priori, but\n   not cross-connected to restore a working\
    \ LSP/span.  The complete\n   establishment of the restoration LSP/span occurs\
    \ only after a failure\n   of the working LSP/span, and requires some additional\
    \ signaling.\n   Both protection and restoration require signaling.  Signaling\
    \ to\n   establish the recovery resources and signaling associated with the\n\
    \   use of the recovery LSP(s)/span(s) are needed.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Recovery Scope
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Recovery Scope\n   Recovery can be applied at various levels throughout\
    \ the network.  An\n   LSP may be subject to local (span), segment, and/or end-to-end\n\
    \   recovery.\n   Local (span) recovery refers to the recovery of an LSP over\
    \ a link\n   between two nodes.\n   End-to-end recovery refers to the recovery\
    \ of an entire LSP from its\n   source (ingress node end-point) to its destination\
    \ (egress node end-\n   point).\n   Segment recovery refers to the recovery over\
    \ a portion of the network\n   of a segment LSP (i.e., an SNC in the ITU-T terminology)\
    \ of an end-\n   to-end LSP.  Such recovery protects against span and/or node\
    \ failure\n   over a particular portion of the network that is traversed by an\n\
    \   end-to-end LSP.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Recovery Domain
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Recovery Domain\n   A recovery domain is defined as a set of nodes and\
    \ spans, over which\n   one or more recovery schemes are provided.  A recovery\
    \ domain served\n   by one single recovery scheme is referred to as a \"single\
    \ recovery\n   domain\", while a recovery domain served by multiple recovery schemes\n\
    \   is referred to as a \"multi recovery domain\".\n   The recovery operation\
    \ is contained within the recovery domain.  A\n   GMPLS recovery domain must be\
    \ entirely contained within a GMPLS\n   domain.  A GMPLS domain (defined as a\
    \ set of nodes and spans\n   controlled by GMPLS) may contain multiple recovery\
    \ domains.\n"
- title: 4.6.  Recovery Types
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Recovery Types\n   The different recovery types can be classified depending\
    \ on the\n   number of recovery LSPs/spans that are protecting a given number\
    \ of\n   working LSPs/spans.  The definitions given hereafter are from the\n \
    \  point of view of a working LSP/span that needs to be protected by a\n   recovery\
    \ scheme.\n   A. 1+1 type: dedicated protection\n   One dedicated protection LSP/span\
    \ protects exactly one working\n   LSP/span, and the normal traffic is permanently\
    \ duplicated at the\n   ingress node on both the working and protection LSPs/spans.\
    \  No extra\n   traffic can be carried over the protection LSP/span.\n   This\
    \ type is applicable to LSP/span protection, but not to LSP/span\n   restoration.\n\
    \   B. 0:1 type: unprotected\n   No specific recovery LSP/span protects the working\
    \ LSP/span.\n   However, the working LSP/span can potentially be restored through\
    \ any\n   alternate available route/span, with or without any pre-computed\n \
    \  restoration route.  Note that no resources are pre-established for\n   this\
    \ recovery type.\n   This type is applicable to LSP/span restoration, but not\
    \ to LSP/span\n   protection.  Span restoration can be achieved, for instance,\
    \ by\n   moving all the LSPs transported over a failed span to a dynamically\n\
    \   selected span.\n   C. 1:1 type: dedicated recovery with extra traffic\n  \
    \ One specific recovery LSP/span protects exactly one specific working\n   LSP/span,\
    \ but the normal traffic is transmitted over only one LSP\n   (working or recovery)\
    \ at a time.  Extra traffic can be transported\n   using the recovery LSP/span\
    \ resources.\n   This type is applicable to LSP/span protection and LSP restoration,\n\
    \   but not to span restoration.\n   D. 1:N (N > 1) type: shared recovery with\
    \ extra traffic\n   A specific recovery LSP/span is dedicated to the protection\
    \ of up to\n   N working LSPs/spans.  The set of working LSPs/spans is explicitly\n\
    \   identified.  Extra traffic can be transported over the recovery\n   LSP/span.\
    \  All these LSPs/spans must start and end at the same nodes.\n   Sometimes, the\
    \ working LSPs/spans are assumed to be resource disjoint\n   in the network so\
    \ that they do not share any failure probability, but\n   this is not mandatory.\
    \  Obviously, if more than one working LSP/span\n   in the set of N are affected\
    \ by some failure(s) at the same time, the\n   traffic on only one of these failed\
    \ LSPs/spans may be recovered over\n   the recovery LSP/span.  Note that N can\
    \ be arbitrarily large (i.e.,\n   infinite).  The choice of N is a policy decision.\n\
    \   This type is applicable to LSP/span protection and LSP restoration,\n   but\
    \ not to span restoration.\n   Note: a shared recovery where each recovery resource\
    \ can be shared by\n   a maximum of X LSPs/spans is not defined as a recovery\
    \ type but as a\n   recovery scheme.  The choice of X is a network resource management\n\
    \   policy decision.\n   E. M:N (M, N > 1, N >= M) type:\n   A set of M specific\
    \ recovery LSPs/spans protects a set of up to N\n   specific working LSPs/spans.\
    \  The two sets are explicitly identified.\n   Extra traffic can be transported\
    \ over the M recovery LSPs/spans when\n   available.  All the LSPs/spans must\
    \ start and end at the same nodes.\n   Sometimes, the working LSPs/spans are assumed\
    \ to be resource disjoint\n   in the network so that they do not share any failure\
    \ probability, but\n   this is not mandatory.  Obviously, if several working LSPs/spans\
    \ in\n   the set of N are concurrently affected by some failure(s), the\n   traffic\
    \ on only M of these failed LSPs/spans may be recovered.  Note\n   that N can\
    \ be arbitrarily large (i.e., infinite).  The choice of N\n   and M is a policy\
    \ decision.\n   This type is applicable to LSP/span protection and LSP restoration,\n\
    \   but not to span restoration.\n"
- title: 4.7.  Bridge Types
  contents:
  - "4.7.  Bridge Types\n   A bridge is the function that connects the normal traffic\
    \ and extra\n   traffic to the working and recovery LSP/span.\n   A. Permanent\
    \ bridge\n   Under a 1+1 type, the bridge connects the normal traffic to both\
    \ the\n   working and protection LSPs/spans.  This type of bridge is not\n   applicable\
    \ to restoration types.  There is, of course, no extra\n   traffic connected to\
    \ the recovery LSP/span.\n   B. Broadcast bridge\n   For 1:N and M:N types, the\
    \ bridge permanently connects the normal\n   traffic to the working LSP/span.\
    \  In the event of recovery switching,\n   the normal traffic is additionally\
    \ connected to the recovery\n   LSP/span.  Extra traffic is either not connected\
    \ or connected to the\n   recovery LSP/span.\n   C. Selector bridge\n   For 1:N\
    \ and M:N types, the bridge connects the normal traffic to\n   either the working\
    \ or the recovery LSP/span.  Extra traffic is either\n   not connected or connected\
    \ to the recovery LSP/span.\n"
- title: 4.8.  Selector Types
  contents:
  - "4.8.  Selector Types\n   A selector is the function that extracts the normal\
    \ traffic from\n   either the working or the recovery LSP/span.  Extra traffic\
    \ is either\n   extracted from the recovery LSP/span, or is not extracted.\n \
    \  A. Selective selector\n   Is a selector that extracts the normal traffic from\
    \ either the\n   working LSP/span output or the recovery LSP/span output.\n  \
    \ B. Merging selector\n   For 1:N and M:N protection types, the selector permanently\
    \ extracts\n   the normal traffic from both the working and recovery LSP/span\n\
    \   outputs.  This alternative works only in combination with a selector\n   bridge.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.10.  Switch-over Mechanism\n   A switch-over is an action that can be performed\

- title: 4.11.  Reversion operations
  contents:
  - "4.11.  Reversion operations\n   A revertive recovery operation refers to a recovery\

    \   D. Recovery Switching time:\n   The time between the initialization of the\
    \ recovery switching\n   operation and the moment the normal traffic is selected\
    \ from the\n   recovery LSP/span.\n   E. Total Recovery time:\n   The total recovery\

    \ time that must elapse after a recovered fault before an\n   LSP/span can be\
    \ used again to transport the normal traffic and/or to\n   select the normal traffic\
    \ from.\n   Note: the hold-off time is defined as the time between the reporting\n\

  contents:
  - "5.  Recovery Phases\n   It is commonly accepted that recovery implies that the\
    \ following\n   generic operations need to be performed when an LSP/span or a\
    \ node\n   failure occurs:\n   - Phase 1: Failure Detection\n   The action of\
    \ detecting the impairment (defect of performance\n   degradation) as a defect\
    \ condition and the consequential activation\n   of SF or SD trigger to the control\
    \ plane (through internal interface\n   with the transport plane).  Thus, failure\
    \ detection (which should\n   occur at the transport layer closest to the failure)\
    \ is the only\n   phase that cannot be achieved by the control plane alone.\n\
    \   - Phase 2: Failure Localization (and Isolation)\n   Failure localization provides,\
    \ to the deciding entity, information\n   about the location (and thus the identity)\
    \ of the transport plane\n   entity that causes the LSP(s)/span(s) failure.  The\
    \ deciding entity\n   can then make an accurate decision to achieve finer grained\
    \ recovery\n   switching action(s).\n   - Phase 3: Failure Notification\n   Failure\
    \ notification phase is used 1) to inform intermediate nodes\n   that LSP(s)/span(s)\
    \ failure has occurred and has been detected and 2)\n   to inform the recovery\
    \ deciding entities (which can correspond to any\n   intermediate or end-point\
    \ of the failed LSP/span) that the\n   corresponding LSP/span is not available.\n\
    \   - Phase 4: Recovery (Protection or Restoration)\n   See Section 4.3.\n   -\
    \ Phase 5: Reversion (Normalization)\n   See Section 4.11.\n   The combination\
    \ of Failure Detection and Failure Localization and\n   Notification is referred\
    \ to as Fault Management.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Entities Involved During Recovery
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Entities Involved During Recovery\n   The entities involved during the\
    \ recovery operations can be defined\n   as follows; these entities are parts\
    \ of ingress, egress, and\n   intermediate nodes, as defined previously:\n   A.\
    \ Detecting Entity (Failure Detection):\n   An entity that detects a failure or\
    \ group of failures; thus providing\n   a non-correlated list of failures.\n \
    \  B. Reporting Entity (Failure Correlation and Notification):\n   An entity that\
    \ can make an intelligent decision on fault correlation\n   and report the failure\
    \ to the deciding entity.  Fault reporting can\n   be automatically performed\
    \ by the deciding entity detecting the\n   failure.\n   C. Deciding Entity (part\
    \ of the failure recovery decision process):\n   An entity that makes the recovery\
    \ decision or selects the recovery\n   resources.  This entity communicates the\
    \ decision to the impacted\n   LSPs/spans with the recovery actions to be performed.\n\
    \   D. Recovering Entity (part of the failure recovery activation\n   process):\n\
    \   An entity that participates in the recovery of the LSPs/spans.\n   The process\
    \ of moving failed LSPs from a failed (working) span to a\n   protection span\
    \ must be initiated by one of the nodes that terminates\n   the span, e.g., A\
    \ or B.  The deciding (and recovering) entity is\n   referred to as the \"master\"\
    , while the other node is called the\n   \"slave\" and corresponds to a recovering\
    \ only entity.\n   Note: The determination of the master and the slave may be\
    \ based on\n   configured information or protocol-specific requirements.\n"

    \ additional restoration signaling.\n   Therefore, this mechanism protects against\
    \ working LSP failure(s) but\n   requires activation of the restoration LSP after\
