  - "                         Multics Address Change\n   We will be changing the Network\
    \ address of MIT-Multics from 6 to 44\n   (decimal) on Monday, December 17, 1973.\
    \  Please make any necessary\n   table and program changes then, and accept our\
    \ apologies for the\n   inconvenience.\n   The change was necessitated by the\
    \ fact that 1) there were some nine\n   uses for the four ports on IMP 6, making\
    \ the second MIT IMP\n   desirable; 2) there were four very active Hosts on IMP\
    \ 6, making the\n   shift of at least one of them to the new, less busy IMP desirable;\n\
    \   and 3) the new Multics machine is some 2000 feet from the old IMP,\n   making\
    \ it the logical candidate for the move.\n   It is likely that we will have one\
    \ or two additional test sessions on\n   the new IMP prior to the changeover date.\
    \  These will be announced in\n   our \"message of the day\", and would only affect\
    \ -- temporarily --\n   users who cannot employ numeric Host addresses directly.\n\
