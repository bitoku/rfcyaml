  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IEEE 802.11i MAC Security Enhancements Amendment [IEEE802.11i]\n\
    \   makes use of IEEE 802.1X [IEEE802.1X], which in turn relies on the\n   Extensible\
    \ Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in [RFC3748].\n   Today, deployments\
    \ of IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs are based on EAP and\n   use several EAP methods,\
    \ including EAP-TLS [RFC2716], EAP-TTLS\n   [TTLS], PEAP [PEAP], and EAP-SIM [EAPSIM].\
    \  These methods support\n   authentication credentials that include digital certificates,\
    \ user-\n   names and passwords, secure tokens, and SIM secrets.\n   This document\
    \ defines requirements for EAP methods used in IEEE\n   802.11 wireless LAN deployments.\
    \  EAP methods claiming conformance to\n   the IEEE 802.11 EAP method requirements\
    \ for wireless LANs must\n   complete IETF last call review.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Requirements Specification
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements Specification\n   In this document, several words are used\
    \ to signify the requirements\n   of the specification.  The key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",\n   \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",\n   and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to\
    \ be interpreted as described in\n   [RFC2119].\n   An EAP authentication method\
    \ is not compliant with this specification\n   if it fails to satisfy one or more\
    \ of the MUST or MUST NOT\n   requirements.  An EAP authentication method that\
    \ satisfies all the\n   MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, and SHOULD NOT requirements is\
    \ said to be\n   \"unconditionally compliant\"; one that satisfies all the MUST\
    \ and MUST\n   NOT requirements but not all the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT requirements\
    \ is\n   said to be \"conditionally compliant\".\n"
- title: 1.2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Terminology\n   authenticator\n      The end of the link initiating EAP\
    \ authentication.  The term\n      authenticator is used in [IEEE802.1X], and\
    \ authenticator has the\n      same meaning in this document.\n   peer\n     \
    \ The end of the link that responds to the authenticator.  In\n      [IEEE802.1X],\
    \ this end is known as the supplicant.\n   Supplicant\n      The end of the link\
    \ that responds to the authenticator in\n      [IEEE802.1X].\n   backend authentication\
    \ server\n      A backend authentication server is an entity that provides an\n\
    \      authentication service to an authenticator.  When used, this\n      server\
    \ typically executes EAP methods for the authenticator.  This\n      terminology\
    \ is also used in [IEEE802.1X].\n   EAP server\n      The entity that terminates\
    \ the EAP authentication method with the\n      peer.  In the case where no backend\
    \ authentication server is used,\n      the EAP server is part of the authenticator.\
    \  In the case where\n      the authenticator operates in pass-through mode, the\
    \ EAP server is\n      located on the backend authentication server.\n   Master\
    \ Session Key (MSK)\n      Keying material that is derived between the EAP peer\
    \ and server\n      and exported by the EAP method.  The MSK is at least 64 octets\
    \ in\n      length.  In existing implementations, an AAA server acting as an\n\
    \      EAP server transports the MSK to the authenticator.\n   Extended Master\
    \ Session Key (EMSK)\n      Additional keying material derived between the EAP\
    \ client and\n      server that is exported by the EAP method.  The EMSK is at\
    \ least\n      64 octets in length.  The EMSK is not shared with the\n      authenticator\
    \ or any other third party.  The EMSK is reserved for\n      future uses that\
    \ are not yet defined.\n   4-Way Handshake\n      A pairwise Authentication and\

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Credential Types\n   The IEEE 802.11i MAC Security Enhancements Amendment\
    \ requires that\n   EAP authentication methods be available.  Wireless LAN deployments\n\
    \   are expected to use different credential types, including digital\n   certificates,\

    \ (GSM and UMTS secrets).  Other credential\n   types that may be used include\
    \ public/private key (without\n   necessarily requiring certificates) and asymmetric\
    \ credential support\n   (such as password on one side, public/private key on\
    \ the other).\n"
- title: 2.2.  Mandatory Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Mandatory Requirements\n   EAP authentication methods suitable for use\
    \ in wireless LAN\n   authentication MUST satisfy the following criteria:\n  \
    \ [1]  Generation of symmetric keying material.  This corresponds to\n       \
    \ the \"Key derivation\" security claim defined in [RFC3748],\n        Section\
    \ 7.2.1.\n   [2]  Key strength.  An EAP method suitable for use with IEEE 802.11\n\
    \        MUST be capable of generating keying material with 128-bits of\n    \
    \    effective key strength, as defined in [RFC3748], Section 7.2.1.\n       \
    \ As noted in [RFC3748], Section 7.10, an EAP method supporting\n        key derivation\
    \ MUST export a Master Session Key (MSK) of at\n        least 64 octets, and an\
    \ Extended Master Session Key (EMSK) of at\n        least 64 octets.\n   [3] \
    \ Mutual authentication support.  This corresponds to the \"Mutual\n        authentication\"\
    \ security claim defined in [RFC3748], Section\n        7.2.1.\n   [4]  Shared\
    \ state equivalence.  The shared EAP method state of the\n        EAP peer and\
    \ server must be equivalent when the EAP method is\n        successfully completed\
    \ on both sides.  This includes the\n        internal state of the authentication\
    \ protocol but not the state\n        external to the EAP method, such as the\
    \ negotiation occurring\n        prior to initiation of the EAP method.  The exact\
    \ state\n        attributes that are shared may vary from method to method, but\n\
    \        typically include the method version number, the credentials\n      \
    \  presented and accepted by both parties, the cryptographic keys\n        shared,\
    \ and the EAP method specific attributes negotiated, such\n        as ciphersuites\
    \ and limitations of usage on all protocol state.\n        Both parties must be\
    \ able to distinguish this instance of the\n        protocol from all other instances\
    \ of the protocol, and they must\n        share the same view regarding which\
    \ state attributes are public\n        and which are private to the two parties\
    \ alone.  The server must\n        obtain the authenticated peer name, and the\
    \ peer must obtain the\n        authenticated server name (if the authenticated\
    \ server name is\n        available).\n   [5]  Resistance to dictionary attacks.\
    \  This corresponds to the\n        \"Dictionary attack resistance\" security\
    \ claim defined in\n        [RFC3748], Section 7.2.1.\n   [6]  Protection against\
    \ man-in-the-middle attacks.  This corresponds\n        to the \"Cryptographic\
    \ binding\", \"Integrity protection\", \"Replay\n        protection\", and \"\
    Session independence\" security claims defined\n        in [RFC3748], Section\
    \ 7.2.1.\n   [7]  Protected ciphersuite negotiation.  If the method negotiates\
    \ the\n        ciphersuite used to protect the EAP conversation, then it MUST\n\
    \        support the \"Protected ciphersuite negotiation\" security claim\n  \
    \      defined in [RFC3748], Section 7.2.1.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Recommended Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Recommended Requirements\n   EAP authentication methods used for wireless\
    \ LAN authentication\n   SHOULD support the following features:\n   [8]  Fragmentation.\
    \  This implies support for the \"Fragmentation\"\n        claim defined in [RFC3748],\
    \ Section 7.2.1.  [RFC3748], Section\n        3.1 states:  \"EAP methods can assume\
    \ a minimum EAP MTU of 1020\n        octets, in the absence of other information.\
    \  EAP methods SHOULD\n        include support for fragmentation and reassembly\
    \ if their\n        payloads can be larger than this minimum EAP MTU.\"\n   [9]\
    \  End-user identity hiding.  This corresponds to the\n        \"Confidentiality\"\

  contents:
  - "2.4.  Optional Features\n   EAP authentication methods used for wireless LAN\
    \ authentication MAY\n   support the following features:\n   [10] Channel binding.\
    \  This corresponds to the \"Channel binding\"\n        security claim defined\
    \ in [RFC3748], Section 7.2.1.\n   [11] Fast reconnect.  This corresponds to the\
    \ \"Fast reconnect\"\n        security claim defined in [RFC3748], Section 7.2.1.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.5.  Non-compliant EAP Authentication Methods\n   EAP-MD5-Challenge (the current\
    \ mandatory-to-implement EAP\n   authentication method), is defined in [RFC3748],\
    \ Section 5.4.  As\n   defined in [RFC3748], EAP-MD5-Challenge, One-Time Password\
    \ (Section\n   5.5), and Generic Token Card (Section 5.6) are non-compliant with\
    \ the\n   requirements specified in this document.  As noted in [RFC3748],\n \
    \  these methods do not support any of the mandatory requirements\n   defined\
    \ in Section 2.2, including key derivation and mutual\n   authentication.  In\
    \ addition, these methods do not support any of the\n   recommended features defined\
    \ in Section 2.3 or any of the optional\n   features defined in Section 2.4.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   Within [IEEE802.11i], EAP is used for both authentication\
    \ and key\n   exchange between the EAP peer and server.  Given that wireless local\n\
    \   area networks provide ready access to an attacker within range, EAP\n   usage\
    \ within [IEEE802.11i] is subject to the threats outlined in\n   [RFC3748], Section\
    \ 7.1.  Security considerations relating to EAP are\n   discussed in [RFC3748],\
    \ Sections 7; where an authentication server is\n   utilized, the security considerations\
    \ described in [RFC3579], Section\n   4, will apply.\n   The system security properties\
    \ required to address the threats\n   described in [RFC3748], Section 7.1, are\
    \ noted in [Housley56].  In\n   the material below, the requirements articulated\
    \ in [Housley56] are\n   listed, along with the corresponding recommendations.\n\
    \   Algorithm independence\n      Requirement: \"Wherever cryptographic algorithms\
    \ are chosen, the\n      algorithms must be negotiable, in order to provide resilience\n\
    \      against compromise of a particular cryptographic algorithm.\"\n      This\
    \ issue is addressed by mandatory requirement [7] in Section\n      2.2.  Algorithm\
    \ independence is one of the EAP invariants\n      described in [KEYFRAME].\n\
    \   Strong, fresh session keys\n      Requirement: \"Session keys must be demonstrated\
    \ to be strong and\n      fresh in all circumstances, while at the same time retaining\n\
    \      algorithm independence.\"\n      Key strength is addressed by mandatory\
    \ requirement [2] in Section\n      2.2.  Recommendations for ensuring the Freshness\
    \ of keys derived\n      by EAP methods are discussed in [RFC3748], Section 7.10.\n\
    \   Replay protection\n      Requirement: \"All protocol exchanges must be replay\
    \ protected.\"\n      This is addressed by mandatory requirement [6] in Section\
    \ 2.2.\n   Authentication\n      Requirements: \"All parties need to be authenticated.\
    \  The\n      confidentiality of the authenticator must be maintained.  No\n \
    \     plaintext passwords are allowed.\"\n      Mutual authentication is required\
    \ as part of mandatory requirement\n      [3] in Section 2.2.  Identity protection\
    \ is a recommended\n      capability, described in requirement [9] in Section\
    \ 2.3.  EAP does\n      not support plaintext passwords, as noted in [RFC3748],\
    \ Section\n      7.14.\n   Authorization\n      Requirement: \"EAP peer and authenticator\
    \ authorization must be\n      performed.\"\n      Authorization issues are discussed\
    \ in [RFC3748], Sections 1.2 and\n      7.16.  Authentication, Authorization,\
    \ and Accounting (AAA)\n      protocols such as RADIUS [RFC2865][RFC3579] may\
    \ be used to enable\n      authorization of EAP peers by a central authority.\
    \  AAA\n      authorization issues are discussed in [RFC3579], Sections 2.6.3\n\
    \      and 4.3.7.\n   Session keys\n      Requirement: \"Confidentiality of session\
    \ keys must be maintained.\"\n      Issues relating to Key Derivation are described\
    \ in [RFC3748],\n      Section 7.10, as well as in [KEYFRAME].\n   Ciphersuite\
    \ negotiation\n      Requirement: \"The selection of the \"best\" ciphersuite\
    \ must be\n      securely confirmed.\"\n      This is addressed in mandatory requirement\
    \ [7] in Section 2.2.\n   Unique naming\n      Requirement: \"Session keys must\
    \ be uniquely named.\"\n      Key naming issues are addressed in [KEYFRAME].\n\
    \   Domino effect\n      Requirement: \"Compromise of a single authenticator cannot\n\
    \      compromise any other part of the system, including session keys\n     \
    \ and long-term secrets.\"\n      This issue is addressed by mandatory requirement\
    \ [6] in Section\n      2.2.\n   Key binding\n      Requirement: \"The key must\
    \ be bound to the appropriate context.\"\n      This issue is addressed in optional\
    \ requirement [10] in Section\n      2.4.  Channel binding is also discussed in\
    \ Section 7.15 of\n      [RFC3748] and Section 4.3.7 of [RFC3579].\n"
