  - "THIS IS THE FIRST OF WHAT ARE PLANNED TO BE MONTHLY REPORTS ON\nTHE STATUS OF\
    \ THE NEW-PROTOCOL TELNET IMPLEMENTAIONS ON THE SERVER\nHOSTS ON THE ARPA NETWORK.\
    \  INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT ARE DATA ONLY\nON SERVER TELNETS AT THE VARIOUS SITES.\
    \  ONE WOULD HOPE THAT ANY\nSITE WITH AN OPERATIONAL NEW-PROTOCOL SERVER TELNET\
    \ WOULD ALSO BOAST\nA NEW-PROTOCOL USER TELNET; WE CAN CERTAINLY ASSUME THIS FOR\
    \ TENEX\nSITES AT WHICH TENEX 1.32 IS OPERATING.  HOWEVER, NO FURTHER CLAIMS\n\
    ARE MADE FOR THE SERVER DATA CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT.\nI AM SORRY TO REPORT THAT\
    \ AT THIS LATE DATE, A MONTH AFTER THE RELEASE\nOF TENEX 1.32, LESS THAN ONE-THIRD\
    \ OF THE SERVER SITES HAVE ANY NEW-\nPROTOCOL SERVER OPERATING, ACCORDING TO MY\
    \ SURVEYS*, AND ONLY HALF\nOF THOSE ARE USING CORRECTLY THE LOGGER SOCKET CONVENTIONS,\
    \ AS I\nUNDERSTAND THEM.  AT THE END OF THIS REPORT IS A COMPLETE TABULATION\n\
    COMPILED FROM MY SURVEYS;  THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY:\n\tTOTAL SERVER HOSTS\t\
    \t32\t100%\n\tSTATUS UNKNOWN (1)\t\t 3\t  9%\n\tNO NEW-PROT SERVER\t\t19\t 59%\n\
    \tTOTAL NEW-PROT IMPLEM.\t\t10\t 31%\n\t  NEW-PROT ON SOCKET 27,\n\t  OLD ON SOCKET\
    \ 1 (2)\t\t 5\t 16%\n \t  NEW-PROT ON 1 AND 27 (3)\t 4\t 13%\n\t  NEW-PROT ON\
    \ 1 ONLY (3)\t 1\t  3%\nNOTES:\n*  ALL DATA IN THIS REPORT WERE GATHERED VIA A\
    \ SURVEYING PROGRAM\n   RUN AT VARIOUS TIMES, PLUS A FEW MANUAL CHECKS TO FILL\
    \ OUT THE\n   DATA.  WHAT IS REPORTED HERE IS THE WAY THE VARIOUS SERVERS WORK\n\
    \   AS SEEN BY THE NEW-PROTOCOL USER TELNET AT BBNA, AS OF 15 AUG.\n   1974. \
    \ THERE MAY BE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THESE RESULTS AND THOSE\n   FROM SURVEYS\
    \ MADE AT OTHER SITES.\n(1) NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS TO CONNECT TO THESE SITES ALL FAILED\
    \ DUE TO\n   THE SITES' BEING DOWN TO THE NETWORK.\n(2) THESE ARE THE SITES WHOSE\
    \ OPERATION IS 100% CORRECT ACCORDING\n   TO ALL PROTOCOLS AND CONVENTIONS, AS\
    \ I UNDERSTAND THEM.\n(3) WE REALIZE THAT SOME OF THE SERVERS THAT APPEAR HERE\
    \ AS NEW-\n   PROTOCOL SERVERS ON SOCKET 1 ARE ACTUALLY SERVERS WHICH ATTEMPT\n\
