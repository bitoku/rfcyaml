- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a method for generating an aggregated\n\
    \   pseudowire (PW) status message transmitted for a statically\n   configured\
    \ PW on a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label\n   Switched Path (LSP) to\
    \ indicate the status of one or more PWs carried\n   on the LSP.\n   The method\
    \ for transmitting the PW status information is not new;\n   however, this protocol\
    \ extension allows a Service Provider (SP) to\n   reliably monitor the individual\
    \ PW status while not overwhelming the\n   network with multiple periodic status\
    \ messages.  This is achieved by\n   sending a single cumulative summary status\
    \ verification message for\n   all the PWs grouped in the same LSP.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   When PWs use a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network\
    \ as the\n   Packet Switched Network (PSN), they are set up using static label\n\
    \   assignment per Section 4 of [RFC8077], and the PW status information\n   is\
    \ propagated using the method described in [RFC6478].  There are two\n   basic\
    \ modes of operation described in [RFC6478], Section 5.3:\n   (1) periodic retransmission\
    \ of non-zero status messages and (2) a\n   simple acknowledgment of PW status\
    \ (Section 5.3.1 of [RFC6478]).  The\n   LSP-level protocol described below applies\
    \ to the case when\n   PW status is acknowledged immediately with a requested\
    \ refresh value\n   of zero (no refresh).  In this case, the PW status refresh\
    \ reduction\n   protocol is necessary for several reasons, such as the following:\n\
    \     i. The PW status refresh reduction protocol greatly increases the\n    \
    \    scalability of the PW status protocol by reducing the amount of\n       \
    \ messages that a Provider Edge (PE) needs to periodically send to\n        its\
    \ neighbors.\n    ii. The PW status refresh reduction protocol will detect a remote\
    \ PE\n        restart.\n   iii. If the local state is lost for some reason, the\
    \ PE needs to be\n        able to request a status refresh reduction from the\
    \ remote PE.\n    iv. The PW status refresh reduction protocol can optionally\
    \ detect a\n        remote PE provisioning change.\n"

- title: 1.3.  Notational Conventions
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Notational Conventions\n   All multiple-word atomic identifiers use underscores\
    \ (\"_\") between\n   the words to join the words.  Many of the identifiers are\
    \ composed of\n   a concatenation of other identifiers.  These are expressed using\n\
    \   double-colon (\"::\") notation.\n   Where the same identifier type is used\
    \ multiple times in a\n   concatenation, they are qualified by a prefix joined\
    \ to the\n   identifier by a dash (\"-\").  For example, Src-Node_ID is the Node_ID\n\
    \   of a node referred to as \"Src\" (\"Src\" is short for \"source\").\n   The\
    \ notation does not define an implicit ordering of the information\n   elements\
    \ involved in a concatenated identifier.\n"
- title: 2.  PW Status Refresh Reduction Protocol
  contents:
  - "2.  PW Status Refresh Reduction Protocol\n   The PW status refresh reduction\
    \ protocol consists of a simple message\n   that is sent at the LSP level, using\
    \ the MPLS Generic Associated\n   Channel (G-ACh) [RFC5586].\n   For a particular\
    \ LSP where the PW status refresh reduction protocol\n   is enabled, a PE using\
    \ this protocol MUST send the PW status refresh\n   reduction Message as soon\
    \ as a PW is configured on that LSP.  The\n   message is then retransmitted at\
    \ a locally configured interval\n   indicated in the Refresh Timer field.  If\
    \ no acknowledgment is\n   received, the protocol does not reach the ACTIVE state\n\
    \   (Section 2.1.3), and the PE SHOULD NOT send any PW status messages\n   with\
    \ a Refresh Timer of zero as described in [RFC6478],\n   Section 5.3.1.\n   It\
    \ is worth noting that no relationship exists between the locally\n   configured\
    \ timer for the PW status refresh reduction protocol and the\n   individual PW\
    \ status Refresh Timers.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Protocol States
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Protocol States\n   The protocol can be in three possible states: INACTIVE,\
    \ STARTUP, and\n   ACTIVE.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  INACTIVE
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  INACTIVE\n   This state is entered when the protocol is turned off. \
    \ This state is\n   also entered if all PWs on a specific LSP are deprovisioned.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  STARTUP
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  STARTUP\n   In this state, the PE transmits periodic PW status refresh\
    \ reduction\n   Messages with the Ack Session ID (Section 4) set to 0.  The PE\n\
    \   remains in this state until a PW status refresh message is received\n   with\
    \ the correct local Session ID in the Ack Session ID field.  State\n   can transition\
    \ from the STARTUP state to the ACTIVE or INACTIVE\n   state.\n"
- title: 2.1.3.  ACTIVE
  contents:
  - "2.1.3.  ACTIVE\n   This state is entered once the PE receives a PW status refresh\n\
    \   reduction Message with the correct local Session ID in the Ack\n   Session\
    \ ID field within 3.5 times the Refresh Timer field value of\n   the last PW status\
    \ refresh reduction Message transmitted.  This state\n   is immediately exited\
    \ in the following scenarios:\n     i. A valid PW status refresh reduction Message\
    \ is not received\n        within 3.5 times the current Refresh Timer field value\
    \ (assuming\n        that a timer transition procedure is not in progress).\n\
    \        New state: STARTUP.\n    ii. A PW status refresh reduction Message is\
    \ received with the wrong\n        Ack Session ID field value or a zero Ack Session\
    \ ID field value.\n        New state: STARTUP.\n   iii. All PWs using the particular\
    \ LSP are deprovisioned, or the\n        protocol is disabled.\n        New state:\
    \ INACTIVE.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Timer Value Change Transition Procedure
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Timer Value Change Transition Procedure\n   If a PE needs to change the\
    \ value of the Refresh Timer field while\n   the PW status refresh reduction protocol\
    \ is in the ACTIVE state, the\n   following procedure must be followed:\n    \
    \ i. A PW status refresh reduction Message is transmitted with the\n        new\
    \ timer value.\n    ii. If the new value is greater than the original one, the\
    \ PE will\n        operate according to the new timer value immediately.\n   iii.\
    \ If the new value is smaller than the original one, the PE will\n        operate\
    \ according to the original timer value for a period\n        3.5 times the original\
    \ timer value or until the first valid PW\n        status refresh reduction Message\
    \ is received.\n        A PE receiving a PW status refresh reduction Message with\
    \ a new\n        timer value will immediately acknowledge the new value via a\
    \ PW\n        status refresh reduction Message and will start operating\n    \
    \    according to the new timer value.\n"
- title: 3.  PW Status Refresh Reduction Procedure
  contents:
  - "3.  PW Status Refresh Reduction Procedure\n   When the PW status refresh reduction\
    \ protocol on a particular LSP is\n   in the ACTIVE state, the PE can send all\
    \ PW status messages, for PWs\n   on that LSP, with a Refresh Timer value of zero.\
    \  This greatly\n   decreases the amount of messages that the PE needs to transmit\
    \ to the\n   remote PE because once the PW status message for a particular PW\
    \ is\n   acknowledged, further repetitions of that message are no longer\n   necessary.\n\
    \   To further reduce the amount of possible messages when an LSP starts\n   forwarding\
    \ traffic, care should be taken to permit the PW status\n   refresh reduction\
    \ protocol to reach the ACTIVE state quickly, and\n   before the first PW status\
    \ Refresh Timer expires.  This can be\n   achieved by using a PW status refresh\
    \ reduction Message Refresh Timer\n   value that is much smaller than the PW status\
    \ message Refresh Timer\n   value in use (Section 5.3.1 of [RFC6478]).\n   If\
    \ the PW status refresh reduction protocol session is terminated by\n   entering\
    \ the INACTIVE state or the STARTUP state, the PE MUST\n   immediately resend\
    \ all the previously sent PW status messages for\n   that particular LSP for which\
    \ the session was terminated.  In this\n   case, the Refresh Timer value MUST\
    \ NOT be set to 0 and MUST be set\n   according to the local policy of the PE\
    \ router.  Implementations MUST\n   take care to avoid flooding the remote PE\
    \ with a large number of PW\n   status messages at once.  If the PW status refresh\
    \ reduction protocol\n   session is terminated for administrative reasons and\
    \ the local PE can\n   still communicate with the remote PE, the local PE SHOULD\
    \ pace the\n   transmission of PW status messages to the remote PE.\n"

    \      *  Checksum\n         A 16-bit field containing the one's complement of\
    \ the one's\n         complement sum of the entire message (including the G-ACh\n\
    \         header), with the Checksum field replaced by zero for the\n        \
    \ purpose of computing the checksum.  An all-zero value means\n         that no\

    \      *  Message Sequence Number\n         An unsigned 16-bit integer that is\
    \ started from 1 when the\n         protocol enters the ACTIVE state.  The sequence\
    \ number wraps\n         back to 1 when the maximum value is reached.  The value\
    \ 0 is\n         reserved and MUST NOT be used.\n      *  Last Received Message\
    \ Sequence Number\n         The sequence number of the last message received.\
    \  If no\n         message has yet been received during this session, this field\n\
    \         is set to 0.\n      *  Message Type\n         The type of control message\
    \ that follows.  Control message\n         types are allocated in this document\
    \ and by IANA.\n      *  (U) Unknown flag bit\n         Upon receipt of an unknown\
    \ message or TLV, if U is clear (0),\n         a notification message with code\
    \ \"Unknown TLV (U-Bit=0)\"\n         (code 0x4) MUST be sent to the remote PE,\
    \ and the keepalive\n         session MUST be terminated by entering the STARTUP\
    \ state; if\n         U is set (1), the unknown message, or message containing\
    \ an\n         unknown TLV, MUST be acknowledged and silently ignored, and the\n\
    \         following messages, or TLVs, if any, processed as if the\n         unknown\
    \ message or TLV did not exist.  In this case, the PE MAY\n         send back\
    \ a single notification message per keepalive session\n         with code \"Unknown\
    \ TLV (U-Bit=1)\".  This last step is OPTIONAL.\n      *  (C) Configuration flag\
    \ bit\n         The C-Bit is used to signal the end of PW configuration\n    \
    \     transmission.  If it is set, the sending PE has finished\n         sending\
    \ all of its current configuration information.\n      *  Flags\n         The\
    \ remaining 6 bits of PW status refresh reduction Message\n         Flags to be\

    \ and ignored on reception.\n      *  Control Message Body\n         The Control\
    \ Message Body is defined in Section 5 and is\n         specific to the type of\
    \ message.\n   It should be noted that the Checksum, Message Sequence Number,\
    \ Last\n   Received Message Sequence Number, Message Type, Flags, and Control\n\
    \   Message Body are OPTIONAL.  The Total Message Length field is used to\n  \
    \ parse how many optional fields are included.  Hence, all optional\n   fields\
    \ that precede a specific field that needs to be included in a\n   specific implementation\
    \ MUST be included if that optional field is\n   also included.\n   If any of\
    \ the above values are outside the specified range, a\n   notification message\

    \ Message is OPTIONAL.\n   A PE that desires to use the PW Configuration Message\
    \ to verify the\n   configuration of PWs on a particular LSP should advertise\
    \ its PW\n   configuration to the remote PE on LSPs that have active keepalive\n\
    \   sessions.  When a PE receives PW configuration information using this\n  \
    \ protocol and it does not support processing the information or is not\n   willing\
    \ to process it, it MUST acknowledge all the PW Configuration\n   Messages with\
    \ the notification code \"PW configuration not supported\".\n   In this case,\
    \ the information in the PW Configuration Message is\n   silently ignored.  If\
    \ a PE receives such a notification, it SHOULD\n   stop sending PW Configuration\
    \ Messages for the duration of the PW\n   status refresh reduction keepalive session.\n\
    \   If PW configuration information is received, it is used to verify the\n  \
    \ accuracy of the local configuration information against the remote\n   PE's\
    \ configuration information.  If a configuration mismatch is\n   detected, where\
    \ a particular PW is configured locally but not on the\n   remote PE, the following\
    \ actions SHOULD be taken:\n     i. The local PW MUST be considered in \"Not Forwarding\"\
    \ state\n        (Section 6.3.2 of [RFC8077]).\n    ii. The PW Attachment Circuit\
    \ status is set to reflect the PW fault.\n   iii. An alarm SHOULD be raised to\
    \ a network management system.\n    iv. A notification message with the notification\
    \ code \"PW\n        configuration mismatch\" MUST be sent to the remote PE. \
    \ Only one\n        such message is REQUIRED per configuration message even if\
    \ the\n        configuration message is split into multiple configuration\n  \
    \      messages due to individual message-size restrictions on a\n        particular\
    \ link.  Upon receipt of such a message, the receiving\n        PE MAY raise an\
    \ alarm to a network management system.  This\n        alarm MAY be cleared when\

  contents:
  - "6.1.  PW ID List Advertising and Processing\n   When configuration messages are\

    \ known\n   configuration information has been sent.  This process allows the\n\
    \   receiving PE to immediately proceed to verify all the currently\n   configured\
    \ PWs on that LSP, eliminating the need for a long waiting\n   period.\n   If\
    \ a new PW is added to a particular LSP, the PE MUST place the\n   configuration\
    \ verification of this PW on hold for a period of at\n   least 30 seconds.  This\
