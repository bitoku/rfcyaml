  - "1.  Introduction\n   Diffserv has been deployed in many networks; it provides\n\
    \   differentiated traffic forwarding based on the Diffserv Codepoint\n   (DSCP)\
    \ field, which is part of the IP header [RFC2474].  This\n   document defines\
    \ a set of common Diffserv classes (Per-Hop Behaviors\n   (PHBs)) and codepoints\
    \ for use at interconnection points to which and\n   from which locally used classes\
    \ and codepoints should be mapped.\n   As described by Section 2.3.4.2 of [RFC2475],\
    \ the re-marking of\n   packets at domain boundaries is a Diffserv feature.  If\
    \ traffic\n   marked with unknown or unexpected DSCPs is received, [RFC2474]\n\
    \   recommends forwarding that traffic with default (best-effort)\n   treatment\
    \ without changing the DSCP markings to better support\n   incremental Diffserv\
    \ deployment in existing networks as well as with\n   routers that do not support\
    \ Diffserv or are not configured to support\n   it.  Many networks do not follow\
    \ this recommendation and instead\n   re-mark unknown or unexpected DSCPs to zero\
    \ upon receipt for default\n   (best-effort) forwarding in accordance with the\
    \ guidance in [RFC2475]\n   to ensure that appropriate DSCPs are used within a\
    \ Diffserv domain.\n   This document is based on the latter approach and defines\
    \ additional\n   DSCPs that are known and expected at network interconnection\n\
    \   interfaces in order to reduce the amount of traffic whose DSCPs are\n   re-marked\
    \ to zero.\n   This document is motivated by requirements for IP network\n   interconnection\
    \ with Diffserv support among providers that operate\n   Multiprotocol Label Switching\
    \ (MPLS) in their backbones, but it is\n   also applicable to other technologies.\
    \  The operational\n   simplifications and methods in this document help align\
    \ IP Diffserv\n   functionality with MPLS limitations resulting from the widely\n\
    \   deployed Short Pipe Model for MPLS tunnel operation [RFC3270].\n   Further,\
    \ limiting Diffserv to a small number of Treatment Aggregates\n   can enable network\
    \ traffic to leave a network with the DSCP value\n   with which it was received,\
    \ even if a different DSCP is used within\n   the network, thus providing an opportunity\
    \ to extend consistent\n   Diffserv treatment across network boundaries.\n   In\
    \ isolation, use of a defined set of interconnection PHBs and DSCPs\n   may appear\
    \ to be additional effort for a network operator.  The\n   primary offsetting\
    \ benefit is that mapping from or to the\n   interconnection PHBs and DSCPs is\
    \ specified once for all of the\n   interconnections to other networks that can\
    \ use this approach.\n   Absent this approach, the PHBs and DSCPs have to be negotiated\
    \ and\n   configured independently for each network interconnection, which has\n\
    \   poor administrative and operational scaling properties.  Further,\n   consistent\
    \ end-to-end Diffserv treatment is more likely to result\n   when an interconnection\
    \ codepoint scheme is used because traffic is\n   re-marked to the same DSCPs\
    \ at all network interconnections.\n   The interconnection approach described\
    \ in this document (referred to\n   as \"Diffserv-Intercon\") uses a set of PHBs\
    \ (mapped to four\n   corresponding MPLS Treatment Aggregates) along with a set\
    \ of\n   interconnection DSCPs allowing straightforward rewriting to domain-\n\
    \   internal DSCPs and defined DSCP markings for traffic forwarded to\n   interconnected\
    \ domains.  The solution described here can be used in\n   other contexts benefiting\
    \ from a defined Diffserv interconnection\n   interface.\n   The basic idea is\
    \ that traffic sent with a Diffserv-Intercon PHB and\n   DSCP is restored to that\
    \ PHB and DSCP at each network\n   interconnection, even though a different PHB\
    \ and DSCP may be used\n   within each network involved.  The key requirement\
    \ is that the\n   network ingress interconnect DSCP be restored at the network\
    \ egress,\n   and a key observation is that this is only feasible in general for\
    \ a\n   small number of DSCPs.  Traffic sent with other DSCPs can be\n   re-marked\
    \ to an interconnect DSCP or dealt with via an additional\n   agreement(s) among\
    \ the operators of the interconnected networks; use\n   of the MPLS Short Pipe\
    \ Model favors re-marking unexpected DSCPs to\n   zero in the absence of an additional\
    \ agreement(s), as explained\n   further in this document.\n   In addition to\
    \ the common interconnecting PHBs and DSCPs,\n   interconnecting operators need\
    \ to further agree on the tunneling\n   technology used for interconnection (e.g.,\
    \ MPLS, if used) and control\n   or mitigate the impacts of tunneling on reliability\
    \ and MTU.\n"

  - "1.1.  Related Work\n   In addition to the activities that triggered this work,\
    \ there are\n   additional RFCs and Internet-Drafts that may benefit from an\n\
    \   interconnection PHB and DSCP scheme.  [RFC5160] suggests\n   Meta-QoS-Classes\
    \ to help enable deployment of standardized end-to-end\n   QoS classes.  The Diffserv-Intercon\
    \ class and codepoint scheme is\n   intended to complement that work (e.g., by\
    \ enabling a defined set of\n   interconnection DSCPs and PHBs).\n   Border Gateway\
    \ Protocol (BGP) support for signaling Class of Service\n   at interconnection\
    \ interfaces [BGP-INTERCONNECTION] [SLA-EXCHANGE] is\n   complementary to Diffserv-Intercon.\
    \  These two BGP documents focus on\n   exchanging Service Level Agreement (SLA)\
    \ and traffic conditioning\n   parameters and assume that common PHBs identified\
    \ by the signaled\n   DSCPs have been established (e.g., via use of the Diffserv-Intercon\n\
    \   DSCPs) prior to BGP signaling of PHB id codes.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Applicability Statement\n   This document is applicable to the use of Differentiated\
    \ Services for\n   interconnection traffic between networks and is particularly\
    \ suited\n   to interconnection of MPLS-based networks that use MPLS Short Pipe\n\
    \   Model tunnels.  This document is also applicable to other network\n   technologies,\
    \ but it is not intended for use within an individual\n   network, where the approach\
    \ specified in [RFC5127] is among the\n   possible alternatives; see Section 3\
    \ for further discussion.\n   The Diffserv-Intercon approach described in this\
    \ document simplifies\n   IP-based interconnection to domains operating the MPLS\
    \ Short Pipe\n   Model for IP traffic, both terminating within the domain and\n\
    \   transiting onward to another domain.  Transiting traffic is received\n   and\
    \ sent with the same PHB and DSCP.  Terminating traffic maintains\n   the PHB\
    \ with which it was received; however, the DSCP may change.\n   Diffserv-Intercon\
    \ is also applicable to Pipe Model tunneling\n   [RFC2983] [RFC3270], but it is\
    \ not applicable to Uniform Model\n   tunneling [RFC2983] [RFC3270].\n   The Diffserv-Intercon\
    \ approach defines a set of four PHBs for support\n   at interconnections (or\
    \ network boundaries in general).\n   Corresponding DSCPs for use at an interconnection\
    \ interface are also\n   defined.  Diffserv-Intercon allows for a simple mapping\
    \ of PHBs and\n   DSCPs to MPLS Treatment Aggregates.  It is extensible by IETF\n\
    \   standardization, and this allows additional PHBs and DSCPs to be\n   specified\
    \ for the Diffserv-Intercon scheme.  Coding space for private\n   interconnection\
    \ agreements or provider internal services is\n   available, as only a single\
    \ digit number of standard DSCPs are\n   applied by the Diffserv-Intercon approach.\n"

  - "1.3.  Document Organization\n   This document is organized as follows: Section\
    \ 2 reviews the MPLS\n   Short Pipe Model for Diffserv Tunnels [RFC3270], because\

    \ how other PHBs (and\n   associated DSCPs) may be mapped to these Treatment Aggregates.\n\
    \   Section 4 also discusses treatment of IP traffic, MPLS VPN Diffserv\n   considerations,\

- title: 2.  MPLS and Short Pipe Model Tunnels
  contents:
  - "2.  MPLS and Short Pipe Model Tunnels\n   This section provides a summary of\
    \ the implications of MPLS Short\n   Pipe Model tunnels and, in particular, their\
    \ use of PHP (see RFC\n   3270) on the Diffserv tunnel framework described in\
    \ RFC 2983.  The\n   Pipe and Uniform Models for Differentiated Services and Tunnels\
    \ are\n   defined in [RFC2983].  RFC 3270 adds the Short Pipe Model to reflect\n\
    \   the impact of MPLS PHP, primarily for MPLS-based IP tunnels and VPNs.\n  \
    \ The Short Pipe Model and PHP have subsequently become popular with\n   network\
    \ providers that operate MPLS networks and are now widely used\n   to transport\
    \ unencapsulated IP traffic.  This has important\n   implications for Diffserv\
    \ functionality in MPLS networks.\n   Per RFC 2474, the recommendation to forward\
    \ traffic with unrecognized\n   DSCPs with default (best-effort) service without\
    \ rewriting the DSCP\n   has not been widely deployed in practice.  Network operation\
    \ and\n   management are simplified when there is a 1-1 match between the DSCP\n\
    \   marked on the packet and the forwarding treatment (PHB) applied by\n   network\
    \ nodes.  When this is done, CS0 (the all-zero DSCP) is the\n   only DSCP used\
    \ for default forwarding of best-effort traffic, and a\n   common practice is\
    \ to re-mark to CS0 any traffic received with\n   unrecognized or unsupported\
    \ DSCPs at network edges.\n   MPLS networks are more subtle in this regard, as\
    \ it is possible to\n   encode the provider's DSCP in the MPLS TC field and allow\
    \ that to\n   differ from the PHB indicated by the DSCP in the MPLS-encapsulated\
    \ IP\n   packet.  If the MPLS label with the provider's TC field is present at\n\
    \   all hops within the provider network, this approach would allow an\n   unrecognized\
    \ DSCP to be carried edge-to-edge over an MPLS network,\n   because the effective\
    \ DSCP used by the provider's MPLS network would\n   be encoded in the MPLS label\
    \ TC field (and also carried\n   edge-to-edge).  Unfortunately, this is only true\
    \ for Pipe Model\n   tunnels.\n   Short Pipe Model tunnels and PHP behave differently\
    \ because PHP\n   removes and discards the MPLS provider label carrying the provider's\n\
    \   TC field before the traffic exits the provider's network.  That\n   discard\
    \ occurs one hop upstream of the MPLS tunnel endpoint (which is\n   usually at\
    \ the network edge), resulting in no provider TC information\n   being available\
    \ at the tunnel egress.  To ensure consistent handling\n   of traffic at the tunnel\
    \ egress, the DSCP field in the MPLS-\n   encapsulated IP header has to contain\
    \ a DSCP that is valid for the\n   provider's network, so that the IP header cannot\
    \ be used to carry a\n   different DSCP edge-to-edge.  See Appendix A for a more\
    \ detailed\n   discussion.\n"
- title: 3.  Relationship to RFC 5127
  contents:
  - "3.  Relationship to RFC 5127\n   This document draws heavily upon the approach\
    \ to aggregation of\n   Diffserv TCs for use within a network as described in\
    \ RFC 5127, but\n   there are important differences caused by characteristics\
    \ of network\n   interconnects that differ from links within a network.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Background of RFC 5127
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Background of RFC 5127\n   Many providers operate MPLS-based backbones\
    \ that employ backbone\n   traffic engineering to ensure that if a major link,\
    \ switch, or router\n   fails, the result will be a routed network that continues\
    \ to\n   function.  Based on that foundation, [RFC5127] introduced the concept\n\
    \   of Diffserv Treatment Aggregates, which enable traffic marked with\n   multiple\
    \ DSCPs to be forwarded in a single MPLS TC based on robust\n   provider backbone\
    \ traffic engineering.  This enables differentiated\n   forwarding behaviors within\
    \ a domain in a fashion that does not\n   consume a large number of MPLS TCs.\n\
    \   RFC 5127 provides an example aggregation of Diffserv service classes\n   into\
    \ four Treatment Aggregates.  A small number of aggregates are\n   used because:\n\
    \   o  The available coding space for carrying TC information (e.g.,\n      Diffserv\
    \ PHB) in MPLS (and Ethernet) is only 3 bits in size and is\n      intended for\
    \ more than just Diffserv purposes (see, e.g.,\n      [RFC5129]).\n   o  The common\
    \ interconnection DSCPs ought not to use all 8 possible\n      values.  This leaves\
    \ space for future standards, private bilateral\n      agreements, and local use\
    \ PHBs and DSCPs.\n   o  Migrations from one DSCP scheme to a different one is\
    \ another\n      possible application of otherwise unused DSCPs.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Differences from RFC 5127
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Differences from RFC 5127\n   Like RFC 5127, this document also uses four\
    \ Treatment Aggregates, but\n   it differs from RFC 5127 in some important ways:\n\
    \   o  It follows RFC 2475 in allowing the DSCPs used within a network to\n  \
    \    differ from those used to exchange traffic with other networks (at\n    \
    \  network edges), but it provides support to restore ingress DSCP\n      values\
    \ if one of the recommended interconnect DSCPs in this\n      document is used.\
    \  This results in DSCP re-marking at both network\n      ingress and network\
    \ egress, and this document assumes that such\n      re-marking at network edges\
    \ is possible for all interface types.\n   o  Diffserv-Intercon suggests limiting\
    \ the number of interconnection\n      PHBs per Treatment Aggregate to the minimum\
    \ required.  As further\n      discussed below, the number of PHBs per Treatment\
    \ Aggregate is no\n      more than two.  When two PHBs are specified for a Diffserv-\n\
    \      Intercon Treatment Aggregate, the expectation is that the provider\n  \
    \    network supports DSCPs for both PHBs but uses a single MPLS TC for\n    \
    \  the Treatment Aggregate that contains the two PHBs.\n   o  Diffserv-Intercon\
    \ suggests mapping other PHBs and DSCPs into the\n      interconnection Treatment\
    \ Aggregates as further discussed below.\n   o  Diffserv-Intercon treats network\
    \ control (NC) traffic as a special\n      case.  Within a provider's network,\
    \ the CS6 DSCP is used for local\n      network control traffic (routing protocols\
    \ and Operations,\n      Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) traffic that is\
    \ essential to\n      network operation administration, control, and management)\
    \ that\n      may be destined for any node within the network.  In contrast,\n\
    \      network control traffic exchanged between networks (e.g., BGP)\n      usually\
    \ terminates at or close to a network edge and is not\n      forwarded through\
    \ the network because it is not part of internal\n      routing or OAM for the\
    \ receiving network.  In addition, such\n      traffic is unlikely to be covered\
    \ by standard interconnection\n      agreements; rather, it is more likely to\
    \ be specifically\n      configured (e.g., most networks impose restrictions on\
    \ use of BGP\n      with other networks for obvious reasons).  See Section 4.2\
    \ for\n      further discussion.\n   o  Because RFC 5127 used a Treatment Aggregate\
    \ for network control\n      traffic, Diffserv-Intercon can instead define a fourth\
    \ Treatment\n      Aggregate for use at network interconnections instead of the\n\
    \      Network Control Treatment Aggregate in RFC 5127.  Network control\n   \
    \   traffic may still be exchanged across network interconnections as\n      further\
    \ discussed in Section 4.2.  Diffserv-Intercon uses this\n      fourth Treatment\
    \ Aggregate for Voice over IP (VoIP) traffic, where\n      network-provided service\
    \ differentiation is crucial, as even minor\n      glitches are immediately apparent\
    \ to the humans involved in the\n      conversation.\n"

  - "4.  The Diffserv-Intercon Interconnection Classes\n   At an interconnection,\
    \ the networks involved need to agree on the\n   PHBs used for interconnection\
    \ and the specific DSCP for each PHB.\n   This document defines a set of four\
    \ interconnection Treatment\n   Aggregates with well-defined DSCPs to be aggregated\
    \ by them.  A\n   sending party re-marks DSCPs from internal usage to the\n  \

    \ extension of\n           the set of DSCPs carried by this Treatment Aggregate).\
    \  This\n           Treatment Aggregate is intended to provide Diffserv-Intercon\n\
    \           network interconnection of a subset of the Real-Time\n           Treatment\
    \ Aggregate defined in RFC 5127, specifically the\n           portions that consume\
    \ significant bandwidth.  This traffic is\n           expected to consist of the\
    \ following classes defined in RFC\n           4594: Broadcast Video, Real-Time\
    \ Interactive, and Multimedia\n           Conferencing.  This Treatment Aggregate\
    \ should be configured\n           with a rate-based queue (consistent with the\
    \ recommendation\n           for the transported TCs in RFC 4594).  By comparison\
    \ to RFC\n           5127, the number of DSCPs has been reduced to one\n     \
    \      (initially).  The AF42 and AF43 PHBs could be added if there\n        \
    \   is a need for three-color marked Multimedia Conferencing\n           traffic.\n\
    \   Assured Elastic Treatment Aggregate:  This Treatment Aggregate\n         \
    \  consists of PHBs AF31 and AF32 (i.e., DSCPs 011 010 and 011\n           100).\
    \  By comparison to RFC 5127, the number of DSCPs has\n           been reduced\
    \ to two.  This document suggests to transport\n           signaling marked by\
    \ AF31 (e.g., as recommended by GSMA IR.34\n           [IR.34]).  AF33 is reserved\
    \ for the extension of PHBs to be\n           aggregated by this Treatment Aggregate.\
    \  For Diffserv-\n           Intercon network interconnection, the following service\n\
    \           classes (per RFC 4594) should be mapped to the Assured\n         \
    \  Elastic Treatment Aggregate: the Signaling service class\n           (being\
    \ marked for lowest loss probability), the Multimedia\n           Streaming service\
    \ class, the Low-Latency Data service class,\n           and the High-Throughput\
    \ Data service class.\n   Default / Elastic Treatment Aggregate:   Transports\
    \ the Default PHB,\n           CS0 with DSCP 000 000.  An example in RFC 5127\
    \ refers to this\n           Treatment Aggregate as \"Elastic Treatment Aggregate\"\
    .  An\n           important difference from RFC 5127 is that any traffic with\n\
    \           unrecognized or unsupported DSCPs may be re-marked to this\n     \
    \      DSCP.  For Diffserv-Intercon network interconnection, the\n           Standard\
    \ service class and Low-Priority Data service class\n           defined in RFC\
    \ 4594 should be mapped to this Treatment\n           Aggregate.  This document\
    \ does not specify an interconnection\n           class for Low-Priority Data\
    \ (also defined RFC 4594).  This\n           traffic may be forwarded with a Lower\
    \ Effort PHB in one\n           domain (e.g., the PHB proposed by Informational\
    \ [RFC3662]),\n           but the methods specified in this document re-mark this\n\
    \           traffic with DSCP CS0 at a Diffserv-Intercon network\n           interconnection.\
    \  This has the effect that Low-Priority Data\n           is treated the same\
    \ as data sent using the Standard service\n           class.  (Note: In a network\
    \ that implements RFC 2474, Low-\n           Priority traffic marked as CS1 would\
    \ otherwise receive better\n           treatment than Standard traffic using the\
    \ default PHB.)\n   RFC 2475 states that ingress nodes must condition all inbound\
    \ traffic\n   to ensure that the DS codepoints are acceptable; packets found to\n\
    \   have unacceptable codepoints must either be discarded or have their\n   DS\
    \ codepoints modified to acceptable values before being forwarded.\n   For example,\
    \ an ingress node receiving traffic from a domain with\n   which no enhanced service\
    \ agreement exists may reset the DS codepoint\n   to CS0.  As a consequence, an\
    \ interconnect SLA needs to specify not\n   only the treatment of traffic that\
    \ arrives with a supported\n   interconnect DSCP but also the treatment of traffic\
    \ that arrives with\n   unsupported or unexpected DSCPs; re-marking to CS0 is\
    \ a widely\n   deployed behavior.\n   During the process of setting up a Diffserv\
    \ interconnection, both\n   networks should define the set of acceptable and unacceptable\
    \ DSCPs\n   and specify the treatment of traffic marked with each DSCP.\n   While\
    \ Diffserv-Intercon allows modification of unacceptable DSCPs, if\n   traffic\
    \ using one or more of the PHBs in a PHB group (e.g., AF3x,\n   consisting of\
    \ AF31, AF32, and AF33) is accepted as part of a\n   supported Diffserv-Intercon\
    \ Treatment Aggregate, then traffic using\n   other PHBs from the same PHB group\
    \ should not be modified to use PHBs\n   outside of that PHB group and, in particular,\
    \ should not be re-marked\n   to CS0 unless the entire PHB group is re-marked\
    \ to CS0.  This avoids\n   unexpected forwarding behavior (and potential reordering;\
    \ see also\n   [RFC7657]) when using Assured Forwarding (AF) PHBs [RFC2597].\n"

    \   Providers only need to deploy mappings of internal DSCPs to/from\n   Diffserv-Intercon\
    \ DSCPs, so that they can exchange traffic using the\n   desired PHBs.  In the\
    \ example, provider O has decided that the\n   properties of his internal class\
    \ AF21 are best met by the Diffserv-\n   Intercon Assured Elastic Treatment Aggregate,\
    \ PHB AF31.  At the\n   outgoing peering interface connecting provider O with\
    \ provider T, the\n   former's peering router re-marks AF21 traffic to AF31. \
    \ The domain\n   internal PHB of provider T that meets the requirement of the\n\
    \   Diffserv-Intercon Assured Elastic Treatment Aggregate is from the\n   AF2x\
    \ PHB group.  Hence, AF31 traffic received at the interconnection\n   with provider\
    \ T is re-marked to AF21 by the peering router of domain\n   T, and domain T has\
    \ chosen to use MPLS TC value 2 for this aggregate.\n   At the penultimate MPLS\
    \ node, the top MPLS label is removed and\n   exposes the IP header marked by\
    \ the DSCP that has been set at the\n   network ingress.  The peering router connecting\
    \ domain T with domain\n   F classifies the packet by its domain-T-internal DSCP\
    \ AF21.  As the\n   packet leaves domain T on the interface to domain F, this\
    \ causes the\n   packet's DSCP to be re-marked to AF31.  The peering router of\
    \ domain\n   F classifies the packet for domain-F-internal PHB AF11, as this is\n\
    \   the PHB with properties matching the Diffserv-Intercon Assured\n   Elastic\
    \ Treatment Aggregate.\n   This example can be extended.  The figure shows provider\
    \ W using CS2\n   for traffic that corresponds to Diffserv-Intercon Assured Elastic\n\
    \   Treatment Aggregate PHB AF31; that traffic is mapped to AF31 at the\n   Diffserv-Intercon\
    \ interconnection to provider T.  In addition,\n   suppose that provider O supports\
    \ a PHB marked by AF22, and this PHB\n   is supposed to obtain Diffserv transport\
    \ within provider T's domain.\n   Then provider O will re-mark it with DSCP AF32\
    \ for interconnection to\n   provider T.\n   Finally, suppose that provider W\
    \ supports CS3 for internal use only.\n   Then no Diffserv-Intercon DSCP mapping\
    \ needs to be configured at the\n   peering router.  Traffic, sent by provider\
    \ W to provider T marked by\n   CS3 due to a misconfiguration may be re-marked\
    \ to CS0 by provider T.\n"

    \ Model tunnels [RFC2983]\n   [RFC3270] when used edge-to-edge in a network.\n\
    \   o  With the Uniform Model, neither the DSCP nor the PHB change.  This\n  \
    \    implies that a network management packet received with a CS6 DSCP\n     \
    \ would be forwarded with an MPLS TC corresponding to CS6.  The\n      Uniform\

- title: 4.3.  Treatment of Network Control Traffic at Carrier Interconnection
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Treatment of Network Control Traffic at Carrier Interconnection\n     \
    \ Interfaces\n   As specified in Section 3.2 of RFC 4594, NC traffic marked by\
    \ CS6 is\n   expected at some interconnection interfaces.  This document does\
    \ not\n   change RFC 4594 but observes that network control traffic received at\n\
    \   a network ingress is generally different from network control traffic\n  \
    \ within a network that is the primary use of CS6 envisioned by RFC\n   4594.\
    \  A specific example is that some CS6 traffic exchanged across\n   carrier interconnections\
    \ is terminated at the network ingress node,\n   e.g., when BGP is used between\
    \ the two routers on opposite ends of an\n   interconnection link; in this case,\
    \ the operators would enter into a\n   bilateral agreement to use CS6 for that\
    \ BGP traffic.\n   The end-to-end discussion in Section 4.2 is generally inapplicable\
    \ to\n   network control traffic -- network control traffic is generally\n   intended\
    \ to control a network, not be transported between networks.\n   One exception\
    \ is that network control traffic makes sense for a\n   purchased transit agreement,\
    \ and preservation of the CS6 DSCP marking\n   for network control traffic that\
    \ is transited is reasonable in some\n   cases, although it is generally inappropriate\
    \ to use CS6 for\n   forwarding that traffic within the network that provides\
    \ transit.\n   Use of an IP tunnel is suggested in order to conceal the CS6 markings\n\
    \   on transiting network control traffic from the network that provides\n   the\
    \ transit.  In this case, the Pipe Model for Diffserv tunneling is\n   used.\n\
    \   If the MPLS Short Pipe Model is deployed for unencapsulated IPv4\n   traffic,\
    \ an IP network provider should limit access to the CS6 and\n   CS7 DSCPs, so\
    \ that they are only used for network control traffic for\n   the provider's own\
    \ network.\n   Interconnecting carriers should specify treatment of CS6-marked\n\
    \   traffic received at a carrier interconnection that is to be forwarded\n  \
    \ beyond the ingress node.  An SLA covering the following cases is\n   recommended\
    \ when a provider wishes to send CS6-marked traffic across\n   an interconnection\
    \ link and that traffic's destination is beyond the\n   interconnected ingress\
    \ node:\n   o  classification of traffic that is network control traffic for both\n\
    \      domains.  This traffic should be classified and marked for the CS6\n  \
    \    DSCP.\n   o  classification of traffic that is network control traffic for\
    \ the\n      sending domain only.  This traffic should be forwarded with a PHB\n\
    \      that is appropriate for transiting NC service class traffic\n      [RFC4594]\
    \ in the receiving domain, e.g., AF31 as specified by this\n      document.  As\
    \ an example, GSMA IR.34 recommends an Interactive\n      class / AF31 to carry\
    \ SIP and DIAMETER traffic.  While this is\n      service control traffic of high\
    \ importance to interconnected\n      Mobile Network Operators, it is certainly\
    \ not network control\n      traffic for a fixed network providing transit among\
    \ such operators\n      and hence should not receive CS6 treatment in such a transit\n\
    \      network.\n   o  any other CS6-marked traffic should be re-marked or dropped.\n"

- title: Appendix A.  The MPLS Short Pipe Model and IP Traffic
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  The MPLS Short Pipe Model and IP Traffic\n   The MPLS Short Pipe\
    \ Model (or penultimate hop label popping) is\n   widely deployed in carrier networks.\
    \  If unencapsulated IP traffic is\n   transported using MPLS Short Pipe, IP headers\
    \ appear inside the last\n   section of the MPLS domain.  This impacts the number\
    \ of PHBs and\n   DSCPs that a network provider can reasonably support.  See Figure\
    \ 2\n   for an example.\n   For encapsulated IP traffic, only the outer tunnel\
    \ header is relevant\n   for forwarding.  If the tunnel does not terminate within\
    \ the MPLS\n   network section, only the outer tunnel DSCP is involved, as the\
    \ inner\n   DSCP does not affect forwarding behavior; in this case, all DSCPs\n\
    \   could be used in the inner IP header without affecting network\n   behavior\
    \ based on the outer MPLS header.  Here, the Pipe Model\n   applies.\n   Layer\
    \ 2 and Layer 3 VPN traffic all use an additional MPLS label; in\n   this case,\
    \ the MPLS tunnel follows the Pipe Model.  Classification\n   and queuing within\
    \ an MPLS network is always based on an MPLS label,\n   as opposed to the outer\
    \ IP header.\n   Carriers often select PHBs and DSCPs without regard to\n   interconnection.\
    \  As a result, PHBs and DSCPs typically differ\n   between network carriers.\
    \  With the exception of best-effort traffic,\n   a DSCP change should be expected\
    \ at an interconnection at least for\n   unencapsulated IP traffic, even if the\
    \ PHB is suitably mapped by the\n   carriers involved.\n   Although RFC 3270 suggests\
    \ that the Short Pipe Model is only\n   applicable to VPNs, current networks also\
    \ use it to transport\n   non-tunneled IPv4 traffic.  This is shown in Figure\
    \ 2 where Diffserv-\n   Intercon is not used, resulting in exposure of the internal\
    \ DSCPs of\n   the upstream network to the downstream network across the\n   interconnection.\n\

    \ Hop Popping Example\n   The packet's IP DSCP must be in a well-understood Diffserv\
    \ context\n   for schedulers and classifiers on the interfaces of the ultimate\
    \ MPLS\n   link (last link traversed before leaving the network).  The necessary\n\
    \   Diffserv context is network-internal, and a network operating in this\n  \
    \ mode enforces DSCP usage in order to obtain robust differentiated\n   forwarding\
    \ behavior.\n   Without Diffserv-Intercon treatment, the traffic is likely to\
    \ leave\n   each network marked with network-internal DSCP.  DSCP_send in the\n\
    \   figure above has to be re-marked into the first network's Diffserv\n   scheme\
    \ at the ingress MPLS Edge Router, to DSCP_d in the example.\n   For that reason,\
    \ the traffic leaves this domain marked by the\n   network-internal DSCP_d.  This\
    \ structure requires that every carrier\n   deploys per-peer PHB and DSCP mapping\
    \ schemes.\n   If Diffserv-Intercon is applied, DSCPs for traffic transiting the\n\
    \   domain can be mapped from and remapped to an original DSCP.  This is\n   shown\
    \ in Figure 3.  Internal traffic may continue to use internal\n   DSCPs (e.g.,\
    \ DSCP_d), and they may also be used between a carrier and\n   its direct customers.\n\
