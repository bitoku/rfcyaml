  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] provides\
    \ mechanisms\n   to describe attributes of multimedia sessions and of media streams\n\
    \   (e.g., Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] sessions) within\n   a\
    \ multimedia session, but does not provide any mechanism to describe\n   individual\
    \ media sources within a media stream.\n   Several recently proposed protocols,\
    \ notably RTP single-source\n   multicast [EXT-SSM], have found it useful to describe\
    \ specific media\n   sources in SDP messages.  Single-source multicast, in particular,\n\
    \   needs to ensure that receivers' RTP synchronization source (SSRC)\n   identifiers\
    \ do not collide with those of media senders, as the RTP\n   specification [RFC3550]\
    \ requires that colliding sources change their\n   SSRC values after a collision\
    \ has been detected.  Earlier work has\n   used mechanisms specific to each protocol\
    \ to describe the individual\n   sources of an RTP session.\n   Moreover, whereas\
    \ the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] is\n   defined as allowing\
    \ multiple sources in an RTP session (for example,\n   if a user has more than\
    \ one camera), SDP has no existing mechanism\n   for an endpoint to indicate that\
    \ it will be using multiple sources or\n   to describe their characteristics individually.\n\
    \   To address all these problems, this document defines a mechanism to\n   describe\
    \ RTP sources, identified by their synchronization source\n   (SSRC) identifier,\
    \ in SDP, to associate attributes with these\n   sources, and to express relationships\
    \ among individual sources.  It\n   also defines a number of new SDP attributes\
    \ that apply to individual\n   sources (\"source-level\" attributes), describes\
    \ how a number of\n   existing media stream (\"media-level\") attributes can also\
    \ be applied\n   at the source level, and establishes IANA registries for source-level\n\
    \   attributes and source grouping semantics.\n"

- title: 3.  Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview\n   In the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550], an association\n\
    \   among a group of communicating participants is known as an RTP\n   Session.\
    \  An RTP session is typically associated with a single\n   transport address\
    \ (in the case of multicast) or communication flow\n   (in the case of unicast),\
    \ though RTP translators and single-source\n   multicast [EXT-SSM] can make the\
    \ situation more complex.  RTP\n   topologies are discussed in more detail in\
    \ [RFC5117].\n   Within an RTP session, the source of a single stream of RTP packets\n\
    \   is known as a synchronization source (SSRC).  Every synchronization\n   source\
    \ is identified by a 32-bit numeric identifier.  In addition,\n   receivers (who\
    \ may never send RTP packets) also have source\n   identifiers, which are used\
    \ to identify their RTP Control Protocol\n   (RTCP) receiver reports and other\
    \ feedback messages.\n   Messages of the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566],\
    \ known\n   as session descriptions, describe multimedia sessions.  A multimedia\n\
    \   session is a set of multimedia senders and receivers as well as the\n   data\
    \ streams flowing from senders to receivers.  A multimedia session\n   contains\
    \ a number of media streams, which are the individual RTP\n   sessions or other\
    \ media paths over which one type of multimedia data\n   is carried.  Information\
    \ that applies to an entire multimedia session\n   is called session-level information,\
    \ while information pertaining to\n   one media stream is called media-level information.\
    \  The collection\n   of all the information describing a media stream is known\
    \ as a media\n   description.  (Media descriptions are also sometimes known informally\n\
    \   as SDP \"m\"-lines, after the SDP syntax that begins a media\n   description.)\
    \  Several standard information elements are defined at\n   both the session level\
    \ and the media level.  Extended information can\n   be included at both levels\
    \ through the use of attributes.\n   (The term \"media stream\" does not appear\
    \ in the SDP specification\n   itself, but is used by a number of SDP extensions,\
    \ for instance,\n   Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [ICE], to denote\
    \ the\n   object described by an SDP media description.  This term is\n   unfortunately\
    \ rather confusing, as the RTP specification [RFC3550]\n   uses the term \"media\
    \ stream\" to refer to an individual media source\n   or RTP packet stream, identified\
    \ by an SSRC, whereas an SDP media\n   stream describes an entire RTP session,\
    \ which can contain any number\n   of RTP sources.  In this document, the term\
    \ \"media stream\" means an\n   SDP media stream, i.e., the thing described by\
    \ an SDP media\n   description, whereas \"media source\" is used for a single\
    \ source of\n   media packets, i.e., an RTP media stream.)\n   The core SDP specification\
    \ does not have any way of describing\n   individual media sources, particularly\
    \ RTP synchronization sources,\n   within a media stream.  To address this problem,\
    \ in this document we\n   introduce a third level of information, called source-level\n\
    \   information.  Syntactically, source-level information is described by\n  \
    \ a new SDP media-level attribute, \"ssrc\", which identifies specific\n   synchronization\
    \ sources within an RTP session and acts as a meta-\n   attribute mapping source-level\
    \ attribute information to these\n   sources.\n   This document also defines an\
    \ SDP media-level attribute, \"ssrc-\n   group\", which can represent relationships\
    \ among media sources within\n   an RTP session in much the same way as the \"\
    group\" attribute\n   [RFC3388] represents relationships among media streams within\
    \ a\n   multimedia session.\n"
- title: 4.  Media Attributes
  contents:
  - "4.  Media Attributes\n   This section defines two media-level attributes, \"\
    ssrc\" and \"ssrc-\n   group\".\n"
- title: 4.1.  The "ssrc" Media Attribute
  contents:
  - "4.1.  The \"ssrc\" Media Attribute\n   a=ssrc:<ssrc-id> <attribute>\n   a=ssrc:<ssrc-id>\
    \ <attribute>:<value>\n   The SDP media attribute \"ssrc\" indicates a property\
    \ (known as a\n   \"source-level attribute\") of a media source (RTP stream) within\
    \ an\n   RTP session. <ssrc-id> is the synchronization source (SSRC) ID of the\n\
    \   source being described, interpreted as a 32-bit unsigned integer in\n   network\
    \ byte order and represented in decimal. <attribute> or\n   <attribute>:<value>\
    \ represents the source-level attribute specific to\n   the given media source.\
    \  The source-level attribute follows the\n   syntax of the SDP \"a=\" line. \
    \ It thus consists of either a single\n   attribute name (a flag) or an attribute\
    \ name and value, e.g.,\n   \"cname:user@example.com\".  No attributes of the\
    \ former type are\n   defined by this document.\n   Within a media stream, \"\
    ssrc\" attributes with the same value of\n   <ssrc-id> describe different attributes\
    \ of the same media sources.\n   Across media streams, <ssrc-id> values are not\
    \ correlated (unless\n   correlation is indicated by media-stream grouping or\
    \ some other\n   mechanism) and MAY be repeated.\n   Each \"ssrc\" media attribute\
    \ specifies a single source-level attribute\n   for the given <ssrc-id>.  For\
    \ each source mentioned in SDP, the\n   source-level attribute \"cname\", defined\
    \ in Section 6.1, MUST be\n   provided.  Any number of other source-level attributes\
    \ for the source\n   MAY also be provided.\n   The \"ssrc\" media attribute MAY\
    \ be used for any RTP-based media\n   transport.  It is not defined for other\
    \ transports.\n   If any other SDP attributes also mention RTP SSRC values (for\n\
    \   example, Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) [RFC3830] [RFC4567]), the\n  \
    \ values used MUST be consistent.  (These attributes MAY provide\n   additional\
    \ information about a source described by an \"ssrc\"\n   attribute or MAY describe\
    \ additional sources.)\n   Though the source-level attributes specified by the\
    \ ssrc property\n   follow the same syntax as session-level and media-level attributes,\n\
    \   they are defined independently.  All source-level attributes MUST be\n   registered\
    \ with IANA, using the registry defined in Section 12.2.\n   Figure 4 in Section\
    \ 10 gives a formal Augmented Backus-Naur Form\n   (ABNF) [RFC5234] grammar for\
    \ the \"ssrc\" attribute.\n   The \"ssrc\" media attribute is not dependent on\

- title: 4.2.  The "ssrc-group" Media Attribute
  contents:
  - "4.2.  The \"ssrc-group\" Media Attribute\n   a=ssrc-group:<semantics> <ssrc-id>\
    \ ...\n   The SDP media attribute \"ssrc-group\" expresses a relationship among\n\
    \   several sources of an RTP session.  It is analogous to the \"group\"\n   session-level\
    \ attribute [RFC3388], which expresses a relationship\n   among media streams\
    \ in an SDP multimedia session (i.e., a\n   relationship among several logically\
    \ related RTP sessions).  As\n   sources are already identified by their SSRC\
    \ IDs, no analogous\n   property to the \"mid\" attribute is necessary; groups\
    \ of sources are\n   identified by their SSRC IDs directly.\n   The <semantics>\
    \ parameter is taken from the specification of the\n   \"group\" attribute [RFC3388].\
    \  The initial semantic values defined for\n   the \"ssrc-group\" attribute are\
    \ FID (Flow Identification) [RFC3388]\n   and FEC (Forward Error Correction) [RFC4756].\
    \  In each case, the\n   relationship among the grouped sources is the same as\

    \ semantics registered with IANA as of this writing\n   are not useful for source\
    \ grouping.  LS (Lip Synchronization)\n   [RFC3388] is redundant for sources within\
    \ a media stream as RTP\n   sources with the same CNAME are implicitly synchronized\
    \ in RTP.  SRF\n   (Single Reservation Flow) [RFC3524] and ANAT (Alternative Network\n\
    \   Address Types) [RFC4091] refer specifically to the media stream's\n   transport\
    \ characteristics.  CS (Composite Session) [FLUTE] is used to\n   group FLUTE\
    \ sessions, and so is not applicable to RTP.)\n   The \"ssrc-group\" attribute\
    \ indicates the sources in a group by\n   listing the <ssrc-id>s of the sources\
    \ in the group.  It MUST list at\n   least one <ssrc-id> for a group and MAY list\
    \ any number of additional\n   ones.  Every <ssrc-id> listed in an \"ssrc-group\"\
    \ attribute MUST be\n   defined by a corresponding \"ssrc:\" line in the same\

    \ on charset.\n   Figure 5 in Section 10 gives a formal Augmented Backus-Naur\
    \ Form\n   (ABNF) [RFC5234] grammar for the \"ssrc-group\" attribute.\n"
- title: 5.  Usage of Identified Source Identifiers in RTP
  contents:
  - "5.  Usage of Identified Source Identifiers in RTP\n   The synchronization source\
    \ identifiers used in an RTP session are\n   chosen randomly and independently\
    \ by endpoints.  As such, it is\n   possible for two RTP endpoints to choose the\
    \ same SSRC identifier.\n   Though the probability of this is low, the RTP specification\n\
    \   [RFC3550] requires that all RTP endpoints MUST be prepared to detect\n   and\
    \ resolve collisions.\n   As a result, all endpoints MUST be prepared for the\
    \ fact that\n   information about specific sources identified in a media stream\
    \ might\n   be out of date.  The actual binding between SSRCs and source CNAMEs\n\
    \   can only be identified by the source description (SDES) RTCP packets\n   transmitted\
    \ on the RTP session.\n   When endpoints are choosing their own local SSRC values\
    \ for media\n   streams for which source-level attributes have been specified,\
    \ they\n   MUST NOT use for themselves any SSRC identifiers mentioned in media\n\
    \   descriptions they have received for the media stream.\n   However, sources\
    \ identified by SDP source-level attributes do not\n   otherwise affect RTP transport\
    \ logic.  Specifically, sources that are\n   only known through SDP, for which\
    \ neither RTP nor RTCP packets have\n   been received, MUST NOT be counted for\
    \ RTP group size estimation, and\n   report blocks MUST NOT be sent for them in\
    \ SR or RR RTCP messages.\n   Endpoints MUST NOT assume that only the sources\
    \ mentioned in SDP will\n   be present in an RTP session; additional sources,\
    \ with previously\n   unmentioned SSRC IDs, can be added at any time, and endpoints\
    \ MUST be\n   prepared to receive packets from these sources.  (How endpoints\n\
    \   handle such packets is not specified here; they SHOULD be handled in\n   the\
    \ same manner as packets from additional sources would be handled\n   had the\
    \ endpoint not received any a=ssrc: attributes at all.)\n   An endpoint that observes\
    \ an SSRC collision between its explicitly\n   signaled source and another entity\
    \ that has not explicitly signaled\n   an SSRC MAY delay its RTP collision-resolution\
    \ actions [RFC3550] by\n   5*1.5*Td, where Td is the deterministic, calculated,\
    \ reporting\n   interval for receivers defined in Section 6.3.1 of the RTP\n \
    \  specification [RFC3550], to see whether the conflict still exists.\n   (This\
    \ gives precedence to explicitly signaled sources and places the\n   burden of\
    \ collision resolution on non-signaled sources.)  SSRC\n   collisions between\
    \ multiple explicitly-signaled sources, however,\n   MUST be acted upon immediately.\n\
    \   If, following RTP's collision-resolution procedures [RFC3550], a\n   source\
    \ identified by source-level attributes has been forced to\n   change its SSRC\
    \ identifier, the author of the SDP containing the\n   source-level attributes\
    \ for these sources SHOULD send out an updated\n   SDP session description with\
    \ the new SSRC if the mechanism by which\n   SDP is being distributed for the\
    \ multimedia session has a mechanism\n   to distribute updated SDP.  This updated\
    \ SDP MUST include a\n   \"previous-ssrc\" source-level attribute, described in\
    \ Section 6.2,\n   listing the source's previous SSRC ID.  (If only a single source\
    \ with\n   a given CNAME has collided, the other RTP session members can infer\
    \ a\n   correspondence between the source's old and new SSRC IDs without\n   requiring\
    \ an updated session description.  However, if more than one\n   source collides\
    \ at once, or if sources are leaving and re-joining,\n   this inference is not\
    \ possible.  To avoid confusion, therefore,\n   sending updated SDP messages is\
    \ always RECOMMENDED.)\n   Endpoints MUST NOT reuse the same SSRC ID for identified\
    \ sources with\n   the same CNAME for at least the duration of the RTP session's\n\
    \   participant timeout interval (see Section 6.3.5 of [RFC3550]).  They\n   SHOULD\
    \ NOT reuse any SSRC ID ever mentioned in SDP (either by\n   themselves or by\
    \ other endpoints) for the entire lifetime of the RTP\n   session.\n   Endpoints\
    \ MUST be prepared for the possibility that other parties in\n   the session do\
    \ not understand SDP source-level attributes, unless\n   some higher-level mechanism\
    \ normatively requires them.  See Section 9\n   for more discussion of this.\n"

    \   sessions containing source attributes.  For brevity, only the media\n   sections\
    \ of the descriptions are given.\n   m=audio 49168 RTP/AVP 0\n   a=ssrc:314159\
    \ cname:user@example.com\n   Figure 1: Example of a declaration of a single synchronization\
    \ source\n   The example in Figure 1 shows an audio stream advertising a single\n\
    \   source.\n   m=video 49170 RTP/AVP 96\n   a=rtpmap:96 H264/90000\n   a=ssrc:12345\

    \    Figure 2: Example of a media stream containing several independent\n    \
    \               sources from a single session member\n   The example in Figure\
    \ 2 shows a video stream where one participant\n   (identified by a single CNAME)\
    \ has several cameras.  The sources\n   could be further distinguished by RTCP\
    \ Source Description (SDES)\n   information.\n   m=video 49174 RTP/AVPF 96 98\n\

    \ among sources\n   used for RTP retransmission [RFC4588] can be explicitly signaled.\n\
    \   This prevents the complexity of associating original sources with\n   retransmission\
    \ sources when SSRC multiplexing is used for RTP\n   retransmission, as is described\
    \ in Section 5.3 of [RFC4588].\n"
- title: 8.  Usage With the Offer/Answer Model
  contents:
  - "8.  Usage With the Offer/Answer Model\n   When used with the SDP Offer/Answer\
    \ Model [RFC3264], SDP source-\n   specific attributes describe only the sources\
    \ that each party is\n   willing to send (whether it is sending RTP data or RTCP\
    \ report\n   blocks).  No mechanism is provided by which an answer can accept\
    \ or\n   reject individual sources within a media stream; if the set of\n   sources\
    \ in a media stream is unacceptable, the answerer's only option\n   is to reject\
    \ the media stream or the entire multimedia session.\n   The SSRC IDs for sources\
    \ described by an SDP answer MUST be distinct\n   from the SSRC IDs for sources\
    \ of that media stream in the offer.\n   Similarly, new SSRC IDs in an updated\
    \ offer MUST be distinct from the\n   SSRC IDs for that media stream established\
    \ in the most recent offer/\n   answer exchange for the session and SHOULD be\
    \ distinct from any SSRC\n   ID ever used by either party within the multimedia\
    \ session (whether\n   or not it is still being used).\n"
- title: 9.  Backward Compatibility
  contents:
  - "9.  Backward Compatibility\n   According to the definition of SDP, interpreters\
    \ of SDP session\n   descriptions ignore unknown attributes.  Thus, endpoints\
    \ MUST be\n   prepared that recipients of their RTP media session may not\n  \
    \ understand their explicit source descriptions, unless some external\n   mechanism\
    \ indicates that they were understood.  In some cases (such\n   as RTP Retransmission\
    \ [RFC4588]), this may constrain some choices\n   about the bitstreams that are\
    \ transmitted.\n   Source descriptions are specified in this document such that\
    \ RTP\n   endpoints that are compliant with the RTP specification [RFC3550]\n\
    \   will be able to decode the media streams they describe whether or not\n  \
    \ they support explicit source descriptions.  However, some deployed\n   RTP implementations\
    \ may not actually support multiple media sources\n   in a media stream.  Media\
    \ senders MAY wish to restrict themselves to\n   a single source at a time unless\
    \ they have some means of concluding\n   that the receivers of the media stream\
    \ support source multiplexing.\n"
