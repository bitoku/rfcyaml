    \ Pre-assigned Journal Numbers\nThis is to announce that RFC numbers can now be\
    \ obtained on-line through\nNLS at OFFICE-1;  they can no longer be obtained on-line\
    \ at SRI-ARC.\nYou may still call the NIC to get an RFC number, if you do not\
    \ wish to\nuse the on-line facilities.\nAlso, please note that pre-assigned journal\
    \ numbers (excepting RFC\nnumbers) can be used through NLS only on the system\
    \ (OFFICE-1 or SRI-\nARC) from which they were taken.\n       [ This RFC was put\
    \ into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives\
    \ by Alex McKenzie with    ]\n       [ support from GTE, formerly BBN Corp.  \
    \          11/99 ]\n"
