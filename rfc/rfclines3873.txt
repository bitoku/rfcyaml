Abstract The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a reliable transport protocol operating on top of a connectionless packet network such as IP.
It is designed to transport public switched telephone network (PSTN) signaling messages over the connectionless packet network, but is capable of broader applications.
This memo defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module which describes the minimum set of objects needed to manage the implementation of the SCTP.
This memo defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module which describes managed objects for implementations of the SCTP.
The document starts with a brief description of the SNMP framework and continues with the MIB explanation and security consideration sections among others.
The managed objects in this MIB module are based on [RFC2012] update: "Management Information Base for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)" referred as [TCPMIB]
(work in progress), and RFC 3291 "Textual Conventions for Internet Network Addresses" [RFC3291].
Terms related to the SCTP architecture are explained in [RFC2960].
Other specific abbreviations are listed below.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
This chapter explains the main objects this MIB defines.
A detailed view of the MIB structure with the OID values is below.
The main groups are explained further in the MIB definition.
This branch contains the SCTP statistics and general parameters (both of them scalars) and the SCTP MIB tables.
The SCTP MIB includes both Counter32s and Counter64s to deal with statistics.
Counter64s are used for those counters, which are likely to wrap around in less than one hour, according to [RFC2863].
In addition Gauge32 is also used.
These statistics are based on the TCP model, but adapted to the SCTP states.
They store the number of successful association attempts, how many associations have been initiated by the local or the remote SCTP layer, and the number of associations terminated in a graceful (by means of SHUTDOWN procedure) or ungraceful way (by means of CLOSE procedure).
This set of objects specifies statistics related to the whole SCTP layer.
There are, e.g., statistics related to both SCTP packets and SCTP chunks.
Statistics related to a specific association, or local/remote IP addresses are defined inside their associated table.
This section of the MIB contains the general variables for the SCTP protocol.
Maximum, minimum, initial and default values are listed here.
SCTP RTO mechanism definition is based on the TCP MIB [TCPMIB].
In SCTP, only options 'other' and 'vanj' are valid since SCTP defines Van Jacobson's algorithm (vanj) as the one to be used to calculate RTO. '
Other' is left for future use.
There are several tables included in the SCTP MIB.
The first group deals with the SCTP association variables and is composed of a main and two extended tables.
The second group is a bunch of tables used to perform reverse lookups.
It is NOT possible to create rows in any table (sctpAssocTable, sctpAssocLocalAddrTable, sctpRemAddrTable and Reverse Lookup tables) using SNMP.
It is NOT possible to delete rows in any table using SNMP except in sctpAssocTable under the particular conditions explained below.
The sctpAssocTable  is the main MIB table, where all the association related information is stored on a per association basis.
It is structured according to expanded tables.
The main table is called sctpAssocTable and is indexed by sctpAssocId (the association identification).
This is a value that uniquely identifies an association.
The MIB does not restrict what value must be written here, however it must be unique within the table.
The sctpAssoc index is also shared by two more tables:  sctpAssocLocalAddrTable: to store the local IP address(es).
sctpAssocRemAddrTable: to store the remote addresses and the per remote address related information.
Entries in the sctpAssocTable are created when trying to establish the association, i.e., when sending the COOKIE ECHO message (originating side) or the COOKIE ACK message (server side).
At this point, i.e., at established state, all entry fields are filled in with valid values.
Note: The following representation is a conceptual mode of describing the relationship between the tables in this MIB.
Note that the real relationship of the tables is by sharing an index, so tables are not truly within tables.
Every entry is explained when defining the corresponding objects in the MIB.
mib 2 {1 3 6 1 2 1}  (104)sctpMIB
(8) sctpAssocRemAddrStartTime Both sctpAssocLocalAddrTable and sctpAssocRemAddrTable are indexed by addresses.
'Addr' and 'AddrType' use the syntax InetAddress and InetAddressType defined in the Textual Conventions for Internet Network Address (RFC3291).
The InetAddressType TC has codepoints for unknown, IPv4, IPv6, non global IPv4, non global IPv6, and DNS addresses, but only the IPv4 and IPv6 address types are required to be supported by implementations of this MIB module.
Implementations that connect multiple zones are expected to support the non global IPv4 and non global IPv6 address types as well.
Note that DNS addresses are not used in this MIB module.
They are always resolved to the on the wire form prior to connection setup, and the on the wire form is what appears in the MIB objects.
The sctpAssocLocalAddrTable table will have as many entries as local IP addresses have been defined for the association.
The sctpAssocRemAddrTable table will contain as many entries as remote IP addresses are known to reach the peer.
For the multihoming concept see reference RFC2960.
To keep the name of the remote peer (when provided by the peer at initialization time), an entry has been created in the sctpAssocTable called sctpAssocRemHostName.
When no DNS name is provided by the remote endpoint, this value will be NULL (zero length string).
Otherwise, the received DNS name will be stored here.
If it is necessary to abort an existing association, the value deleteTCB(9) must be written in the variable sctpAssocState.
That is the only way to delete rows in any of the mentioned tables.
There are five reverse lookup tables to help management applications efficiently access conceptual rows in other tables.
These tables allow management applications to avoid expensive tree walks through large numbers of associations.
All of these tables are optional.
If these tables are implemented, an entry in them must be created after the entry in the main table (sctpAssocTable) associated with it has been created.
This ensures that the field indexing the lookup table exists.
The defined reverse lookup tables allow for performing a lookup using the following variables:
Local Port: It allows a management application to find all the associations that use a specific local port
Remote Port: It allows a management application to find all the associations that use a specific remote port  Remote Host Name: It allows a management application to find all the associations with a specific host name.
: It allows a management application to find all the associations that use a specific remote IP address as primary.
Remote IP address: a management application to find all the associations that use a specific remote IP address.
As an example the picture below shows the table to look up by local port.
It is not possible for the operator to either create or delete rows in these tables.
The rows in this table will dynamically appear and be removed as the corresponding entries in sctpAssocTable are.
The conformance section recommends all the inverse lookup tables in this MIB as optional.
General layer and per association parameters and statistics are considered mandatory.
IP addresses use the global IPv4 and global IPv6 address formats.
Unknown value and DNS name formats are not used.
Names, if present, are stored in the sctpRemoteHostName variable.

Compiling Notes When compiling the MIB module warnings similar to the following may occur:  warning: index of row
`sctpAssocLocalAddrEntry' can exceed OID size limit by 141 subidentifier(s)
index of row `sctpAssocRemAddrEntry' can exceed OID size limit by 141 subidentifier(s)
index of row `sctpLookupRemHostNameEntry' can exceed OID size limit by 140 subidentifier(s)
index of row `sctpLookupRemPrimIPAddrEntry' can exceed OID size limit by 141 subidentifier(s)
`sctpLookupRemIPAddrEntry' can exceed OID size limit by 141 subidentifier(s)
These warnings are due to the fact that the row objects have index objects of type InetAddress or OCTET STRING whose size limit is 255 octets, and if that size limit were reached the names of column instances in those rows would exceed the 128 sub identifier limit imposed by current versions of the SNMP.
Actual limitations for the index object sizes are noted in the conceptual row DESCRIPTION clauses.
For the InetAddress index objects these size limits will not be reached with any of the address types in current use.
There are management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX  ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
The sctpAssocState object has a MAX ACCESS clause of read write, which allows termination of an arbitrary connection.
Unauthorized access could cause a denial of service.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
Thus, it is important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:  The sctpAssocTable, sctpAssocLocalAddressTable, sctpAssocRemAddressTable and the lookup tables contain objects providing information on the active associations on the device, local and peer's IP addresses, the status of these associations and the associated processes.
This information may be used by an attacker to launch attacks against known/unknown weakness in certain protocols/applications.
The sctpAssocTable contains objects providing information on local and remote ports objects, that can be used to identify what ports are open on the machine and can thus suggest what attacks are likely to succeed, without the attacker having to run a port scanner.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
The above objects also have privacy implications, i.e., they disclose who is connecting to what hosts.
These are sensitive from a perspective of preventing traffic analysis, and also to protect individual privacy.
