SEPTEMBER, 1974, SURVEY OF NEW PROTOCOL TELNET SERVERS
LAST MONTH'S SURVEY PRODUCED A GRATIFYING AMOUNT OF FEEDBACK
CLARIFYING THE STATUS OF SEVERAL SITES
; HOWEVER THERE HAVE BEEN VERY FEW CHANGES IN THE STATUS OF HOST SERVERS.
THE CHANGES IN THIS MONTH'S LIST
, IN NUMERICAL ORDER (HOST NUMBER THROUGHOUT ARE OCTAL):
UCLA NMC IS NO LONGER
A SERVER; HOST 205 IS NOW
BBN TENEXD, A NEW SYSTEM (BBNB) IS NOW HOST 61;
RAND RCC WAS ACCIDENTALLY OMITTED FROM THE PREVIOUS LIST; SDC LAB HAS BEEN TEMPORARILY ELIMINATED FROM THE LIST
IT RETURNS TO THE NET
; I4 TENEXA (117) IS NOT A SERVER
TENEX (217) IS, AND HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE LIST; AMES 67 FIXED A BUG, REVEALING TO THE WORLD
THE NEW PROTOCOL SERVER (NO OPTIONS)
THAT WAS THERE ALL ALONG; ISI DEVTENEX (226) AND USC ECL (327) HAVE BEEN ADDED.
WHAT FOLLOWS IS AN UPDATE OF THE SUMMARY AND TABULATION
THERE IS STILL A LONG WAY TO GO TO 100% NEW PROTOCOL IMPLEMENTATION.
ALL DATA IN THIS REPORT WERE GATHERED VIA
RUN AT VARIOUS TIMES, PLUS A FEW MANUAL CHECKS TO FILL OUT THE DATA.
WHAT IS REPORTED HERE IS THE WAY
THE VARIOUS SERVERS WORK AS SEEN BY THE NEW PROTOCOL USER TELNET
AT BBNA, AS OF 23 SEPT.
(2) THESE ARE THE SITES
WHOSE OPERATION IS 100% CORRECT
ACCORDING TO ALL PROTOCOL AND CONVENTIONS, AS I UNDERSTAND THEM.
(3) WE REALIZE THAT SOME OF THE SERVERS
WHICH ATTEMPT TO COMMUNICATE WITH
BOTH OLD  AND NEW PROTOCOL USER TELNETS
ACCORDING TO WHAT CONTROL SEQUENCES ARE RECEIVED.
TABULATION OF SERVER STATUS FOR ALL SERVER SITES:
O3 KEY TO SERVER STATUS TABLE:
TO USER (SERVER SAYS "
(# IS OPTION NUMBER IN NEW PROTOCOL.
ALL OPTIONS IMPLEMENTED BY ANYONE ARE: 0
THERE APPEARS TO BE A MINOR BUG IN SU AI'S SERVER:
IT SEEMS TO SEND AN IMPROPER RESPONSE TO A REQUEST FOR OPTION 0.
