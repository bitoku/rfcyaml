  - "                              NAME/FINGER\nIntroduction\n   This note describes\
    \ the Name/Finger protocol.  This is a simple\n   protocol which provides an interface\
    \ to the Name and Finger programs\n   at several network sites.  These programs\
    \ return a friendly,\n   human-oriented status report on either the system at\
    \ the moment or a\n   particular person in depth.  Currently only the SAIL (SU-AI),\
    \ SRI\n   (SRI-(KA/KL)), and ITS (MIT-(AI/ML/MC/DMS)) sites support this\n   protocol,\
    \ but there are other systems with similar programs that\n   could easily be made\
    \ servers; there is no required format and the\n   protocol consists mostly of\
    \ specifying a single \"command line\".\nTo use via the network:\n   ICP to socket\
    \ 117 (octal, 79. decimal) and establish two 8-bit\n   connections.\n   Send a\
    \ single \"command line\", ending with <CRLF>.\n   Receive information which will\
    \ vary depending on the above line and\n   the particular system.  The server\
    \ closes its connections as soon as\n   this output is finished.\nThe command\
    \ line:\n   Systems may differ in their interpretations of this line.  However,\n\
    \   the basic scheme is straightforward:  if the line is null (i.e. just\n   a\
    \ <CRLF> is sent) then the server should return a \"default\" report\n   which\
    \ lists all people using the system at that moment.  If on the\n   other hand\
    \ a user name is specified (e.g. FOO<CRLF>) then the\n   response should concern\
    \ only that particular user, whether logged in\n   or not.\n   Both ITS and SAIL\
    \ sites allow several names to be included on the\n   line, separated by commas;\
    \ but the syntax for some servers can be\n   slightly more elaborate.  For example,\
    \ if \"/W\" (called the \"Whois\n   switch\") also appears on the line given to\
    \ an ITS server, much fuller\n   descriptions are returned.  The complete documentation\
    \ may be found\n   at any time in the files \".INFO.;NAME ORDER\" on MIT-AI,\n\
    \   \"FINGER.LES[UP,DOC]\" on SU-AI, and \"<DOCUMENTATION>FINGER.DOC\" on\nName/Finger\n\
    \   SRI-KL, all freely accessible by FTP (with the exception of SRI-KL,\n   where\
    \ TOPS-20 requires the \"anonymous\" login convention).\n   Allowable \"names\"\
    \ in the command line should of course include \"user\n   names\" or \"login names\"\
    \ as defined by the system, but it is also\n   reasonable to understand last names\
    \ or even full names as well.  If a\n   name is ambiguous, all possible derivations\
    \ should be returned in\n   some fashion; SAIL will simply list the possible names\
    \ and no more,\n   whereas an ITS server will furnish the full standard information\
    \ for\n   each possibility.\nResponse to null command line - \"default\" listing:\n\
    \   This is a request for a list of all online users, much like a TOPS-10\n  \
    \ or TENEX \"systat\".  To fulfill the basic intent of the Name/Finger\n   programs,\
    \ the returned list should include at least the full names of\n   each user and\
    \ the physical locations of their terminals insofar as\n   they can be determined.\
    \  Including the job name and idle time (number\n   of minutes since last typein,\
    \ or since last job activity) is also\n   reasonable and useful.  The appendix\
    \ has examples which demonstrate\n   how this information can be formatted.\n\
    Response to non-null command line - \"name\" listing:\n   For in-depth status\
    \ of a specified user, there are two main cases.\n   If the user is logged in,\
    \ a line or two is returned in the same\n   format as that for the \"default\"\
    \ listing, but showing only that user.\n   If not logged in, things become more\
    \ interesting.  Furnishing the\n   full name and time of last logout is the expected\
    \ thing to do, but\n   there is also a \"plan\" feature, wherein a user may leave\
    \ a short\n   message that will be included in the response to such requests.\
    \  This\n   is easily implemented by (for example) having the program look for\
    \ a\n   specially named text file on the user's directory or some common\n   area.\
    \  See the examples for typical \"plans\".\nImplementation miscellany:\n   Anyone\
    \ wishing to implement such a server is encouraged to get in\n   touch with the\
    \ maintainers of NAME by sending a message to BUG-NAME @\n   MIT-AI;  apart from\
    \ offering advice and help, a list of all sites\n   with such servers is kept\
    \ there.  It is also suggested that any\n   existing programs performing similar\
    \ functions locally (i.e. not as\n   net servers) be extended to allow specification\
    \ of other sites, or\n   names at other sites.  For example, on ITS systems one\
    \ can say\n   \":NAME<cr>\" for a local default listing, or \":NAME @SAIL<cr>\"\
    \ for\n   SAIL's default listing, or \":NAME Foo@MC<cr>\" to ask MIT-MC about\n\
    \   Foo's status, etc.\nName/Finger\n   It should be noted that connecting directly\
    \ to the server from a TIP\n   or an equally narrow-minded TELNET-protocol user\
    \ program can result\n   in meaningless attempts at option negotiation being sent\
    \ to the\n   server, which will foul up the command line interpretation unless\
    \ the\n   server knows enough to filter out IAC's and perhaps even respond\n \
    \  negatively (IAC WON'T) to all option commands received.  This is a\n   convenience\
    \ but is not at all required, since normally the user side\n   is just an extended\
    \ NAME/FINGER type program.\nAnd finally a little background:\n   The FINGER program\
    \ at SAIL, written by Les Earnest, was the\n   inspiration for the NAME program\
    \ on ITS.  Earl Killian at MIT and\n   Brian Harvey at SAIL were jointly responsible\
    \ for implementing the\n   protocol just described, and Greg Hinchliffe has recently\
    \ brought up\n   a similar server for SRI-KA and SRI-KL.\nAppendix - Examples\n\
    Note: it is possible for some lines of the actual output to exceed 80\nchars in\
    \ length.  The handling of such lines is of course dependant on\nthe particular\
    \ user program; in these examples, lines have been\ntruncated to 72 chars for\
    \ greater clarity.\n                Three examples with a null command line:\n\
