  - "1.  Overview\n   This document provides an overview of the NSFNET Backbone routing\n\
    \   with specific emphasis on the intra-backbone routing.\n   By the end of 1987,\
    \ the American National Standardization Institute\n   (ANSI) forwarded a specification\
    \ for an Intermediate System to\n   Intermediate System routing protocol to the\
    \ International\n   Standardization Organizations (ISO) for the adaptation as\
    \ an\n   international standard.  This ANSI IS-IS protocol is used as the\n  \
    \ interior gateway protocol (IGP) of the NSFNET backbone.  Documented\n   here\
    \ is an implementation description which also includes further\n   definitions\
    \ that were necessary for the integration into an Internet\n   Protocol (IP) environment.\
    \  Therefore, it should be viewed as a\n   continuation of the specifications\
    \ of the ANSI IS-IS protocol [1] and\n   the ISO standard End System to Intermediate\
    \ System (ES-IS) protocol\n   [2].  While the ANSI IS-IS protocol suffices as\
    \ an IGP, additional\n   methods are used to orchestrate routing between the backbone\
    \ and the\n   attached mid-level networks; most notably the Exterior Gateway\n\
    \   Protocol (EGP).  Further information about the overall NSFNET routing\n  \
    \ as well as some future aspects can be found in [3], [4], [5] and [6].\n"

  - "2.  A brief overview of the NSFNET backbone\n   The NSFNET backbone is a wide\
    \ area network which currently connects\n   thirteen sites within the continental\
    \ United States.  All connections\n   are permanent point-to-point links at T1\
    \ speed (1.544Mbps).  These T1\n   links may contain multiple logical links at\
    \ sub-T1 and up to the full\n   T1 speed.  The result is a hybrid circuit/packet\
    \ switching network\n   able to contain a connectivity-richer logical topology\
    \ than the\n   underlying physical topology would allow by itself.  Each site\
    \ has a\n   Nodal Switching Subsystem (NSS) which is responsible for packet\n\
    \   switching.  Each NSS is a RISC technology based multiprocessor system\n  \
    \ using IBM RT/PC processors which operate a modified version of a\n   4.3BSD\
    \ kernel.  For the purpose of routing, each NSS is considered as\n   a single\
    \ entity which has connections to both other NSS (via the\n   logical network\
    \ infrastructure) and to regional networks (via local\n   area network attachments;\
    \ typically an Ethernet).\n   The routing protocol which is used for the inter-NSS\
    \ routing within\n   the NSFNET backbone is an adaptation of the ANSI IS-IS routing\n\
    \   protocol [1].  The routing protocol which is used between the\n   backbone\
    \ and the attached mid-level networks is the Exterior Gateway\n   Protocol (EGP)\
    \ [3].  The information exchange between the backbone\n   and its connected EGP\
    \ peers is subject to policy based routing\n   restrictions which are maintained\
    \ in the Policy Based Routing\n   Database [4,5].\n"
- title: 3.  An overview of the ANSI IS-IS routing document
  contents:
  - "3.  An overview of the ANSI IS-IS routing document\n   The ANSI IS-IS routing\
    \ protocol specifies a two level hierarchical\n   routing where Level 1 routing\
    \ deals with routing within an area,\n   while Level 2 routing deals with routing\
    \ between different areas.\n   This routing protocol belongs to a class of so\
    \ called \"Link State\"\n   protocols where each node maintains a complete topology\
    \ of the whole\n   network.  The route computation is based on a modified version\
    \ of\n   Dijkstra's Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm.\n   Both Level 1 and\
    \ Level 2 routing use two types of Protocol Data Units\n   (PDU):\n        The\
    \ Level 1 Router Link PDU lists IS neighbors.  The Level 1 End\n        System\
    \ PDU lists ES neighbors.\n        The Level 2 Router Link PDU lists neighbor\
    \ Level 2 routes.  The\n        Level 2 End System PDU lists address prefixes\
    \ for systems in\n        other Routing Domains.\n   The ANSI IS-IS document separates\
    \ subnetwork independent functions\n   from the subnetwork dependent functions.\
    \  Subnetwork independent\n   functions include dissemination of Router Link and\
    \ End System Link\n   PDU's and the Routing Algorithm.  The subnetwork dependent\
    \ functions\n   cover different types of subnets such as X.25, permanent point-to-\n\
    \   point links and LANs.\n   The IS-IS Protocol is designed to interoperate with\
    \ the End System to\n   Intermediate System (ES-IS) routing exchange protocol\
    \ [2].  The ES-IS\n   protocol is used to determine connectivity and network layer\n\
    \   addresses.  This information is used to construct the Router Link\n   PDUs.\n"
- title: 4.  How the ANSI IS-IS protocol is adapted for the NSFNET backbone
  contents:
  - "4.  How the ANSI IS-IS protocol is adapted for the NSFNET backbone\n    routing\n\
    \   The NSFNET backbone implements a subset of the ANSI IS-IS protocol.\n   With\
    \ respect to subnetwork independent functions, it only supports\n   Level 2 routing.\
    \  With respect to subnetwork dependent functions, it\n   only supports general\
    \ topology subnetworks with permanent point-to-\n   point links.  Since the ANSI\
    \ IS-IS protocol is designed for ISO\n   Network Service Access Point (NSAP) addresses,\
    \ there is a need to\n   encapsulate IP addresses into NSAP addresses.\n   For\
    \ this, the Initial Domain Part (IDP) is unused.  The Domain\n   Specific Part\
    \ (DSP) includes nine bytes which are partitioned as\n   follows:\n        2 bytes\
    \ - administrative domain\n        2 bytes - empty\n        4 bytes - IP address\n\
    \        1 byte  - empty\n   In the ANSI IS-IS protocol, each router has its own\
    \ identifier (ID)\n   which is 6 bytes long.  For the NSFNET implementation, the\
    \ first 2\n   bytes of the ID are empty and the last four bytes include the IP\n\
    \   address of a particular router.\n   The NSFNET backbone PDUs (both IS-IS and\
    \ IS-ES) are transmitted as a\n   protocol on top of IP, with \"85\" being the\
    \ assigned protocol number\n   for this purpose.  The IS-IS PDUs are distinguished\
    \ from the IS-ES\n   PDUs by the Protocol Discriminator Field within the PDUs.\
    \  The IP\n   fragmentation/reassembly mechanism provides support for transmission\n\
    \   of up to 64 kilobytes in a single IP packet.  Within the backbone, it\n  \
    \ is highly unlikely that the size of IS-IS PDUs will exceed this\n   limit. \
    \ Therefore, no IS-IS fragmentation/reassembly is implemented\n   for this environment.\
    \  This is different from the ISO framework where\n   the ISIS is located directly\
    \ on top of the Data Link Layer.\n   For the purpose of the NSFNET Backbone routing,\
    \ each Autonomous\n   System (AS) is treated as a separate Administrative Domain\
    \ (AD).  The\n   list of administrative domains (as obtained via EGP and filtered\n\
    \   through the Policy Based Routing Database) which are connected\n   directly\
    \ to a particular NSS is distributed in the set of the\n   partitionAreaAddresses\
    \ part of the Level 2 Router Links PDU.  Each\n   area address is 5 bytes long\
    \ and consists of 3 empty bytes (IDP)\n   followed by 2 bytes of the Administrative\
    \ Domain.\n   The reachability information obtained from regional networks via\
    \ EGP\n   is distributed within the backbone by End System PDUs.  In order to\n\
    \   support multi-domain topologies, the ANSI IS-IS protocol allows for a\n  \
    \ set of Address Prefixes to be entered by the System Management at the\n   boundary\
    \ IS.  In the NSFNET Backbone, these Address Prefixes are\n   obtained via the\
    \ Exterior Gateway Protocol.  For each network listed\n   in EGP NR packets which\
    \ is received from an EGP peer, the network and\n   administrative domain number\
    \ of the EGP peer are encapsulated into\n   NSAP addresses (as described above).\
    \  A complete NSAP address is used\n   as an address prefix in the reachable address\
    \ prefix neighbor part of\n   the End System PDU.  The cost field in the reachable\
    \ address prefix\n   neighbor part of the End System PDU is derived from the Policy\
    \ Based\n   Routing Database maintained in each NSS.\n   At each NSS, the reachability\
    \ information obtained from other nodes\n   (via their End System PDU's) is passed\
    \ on to the mid-level network\n   EGP peers, following the appropriate processing\
    \ and filtering\n   according to the Policy Based Routing Database.\n   The Network\
    \ Entity Title (NET) (which is used in the IS-ES protocol)\n   is eleven bytes\
    \ long and is constructed by first encapsulating an IP\n   address into a NSAP\
    \ address, then taking the first 11 bytes of this\n   address as a NET.\n"
