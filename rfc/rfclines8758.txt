Abstract This document deprecates RC4 in Secure Shell (SSH).
Therefore, this document formally moves RFC 4345 to Historic status.
The usage of RC4 suites (also designated as "arcfour") for SSH is specified in [RFC4253] and [RFC4345].
[RFC4253] specifies the allocation of the "arcfour" cipher for SSH.
[RFC4345] specifies and allocates the "arcfour128" and "arcfour256" ciphers for SSH.
RC4 encryption has known weaknesses [RFC7465] [RFC8429]; therefore, this document starts the deprecation process for their use in Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC4253].
Accordingly, [RFC4253] is updated to note the deprecation of the RC4 ciphers, and [RFC4345] is moved to Historic status, as all ciphers it specifies MUST NOT be used.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
[RFC4253] is updated to prohibit arcfour's use in SSH.
[RFC4253], Section 6.3 allocates the "arcfour" cipher by defining a list of defined ciphers in which the "arcfour" cipher appears as optional, as shown in Table 1.
This document updates the status of the "arcfour" ciphers in the list found in [RFC4253]
, Section 6.3 by moving it from OPTIONAL to MUST NOT.
[RFC4253] defines the "arcfour" ciphers with the following text:
The "arcfour" cipher is the Arcfour stream cipher with 128 bit    keys.
The Arcfour cipher is believed to be compatible with the    RC4 cipher [SCHNEIER].
Arcfour (and RC4) has problems with weak    keys, and should be used with caution.
Arcfour (and RC4) has known weaknesses [RFC7465]
[RFC8429] and MUST NOT be used.
The IANA has updated the "Encryption Algorithm Names" subregistry in the "Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Parameters" registry [IANA].
The registration procedure is IETF review, which is achieved by this document.
The registry has been updated as follows:
This document only prohibits the use of RC4 in SSH; it introduces no new security considerations.
