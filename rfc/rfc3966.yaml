  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines the URI scheme \"tel\", which describes\
    \ resources\n   identified by telephone numbers.  A telephone number is a string\
    \ of\n   decimal digits that uniquely indicates the network termination point.\n\
    \   The number contains the information necessary to route the call to\n   this\
    \ point.  (This definition is derived from [E.164] but encompasses\n   both public\
    \ and private numbers.)\n   The termination point of the \"tel\" URI telephone\
    \ number is not\n   restricted.  It can be in the public telephone network, a\
    \ private\n   telephone network, or the Internet.  It can be fixed or wireless\
    \ and\n   address a fixed wired, mobile, or nomadic terminal.  The terminal\n\
    \   addressed can support any electronic communication service (ECS),\n   including\
    \ voice, data, and fax.  The URI can refer to resources\n   identified by a telephone\
    \ number, including but not limited to\n   originators or targets of a telephone\
    \ call.\n   The \"tel\" URI is a globally unique identifier (\"name\") only; it\
    \ does\n   not describe the steps necessary to reach a particular number and\n\
    \   does not imply dialling semantics.  Furthermore, it does not refer to\n  \
    \ a specific physical device, only to a telephone number.\n   As commonly understood,\
    \ telephone numbers comprise two related but\n   distinct concepts: a canonical\
    \ address-of-record and a dial string.\n   We define the concepts below:\n   Address-of-record\
    \ or identifier: The telephone number is understood\n      here as the canonical\
    \ address-of-record or identifier for a\n      termination point within a specific\
    \ network.  For the public\n      network, these numbers follow the rules in E.164\
    \ [E.164], while\n      private numbers follow the rules of the owner of the private\n\
    \      numbering plan.  Subscribers publish these identifiers so that\n      they\
    \ can be reached, regardless of the location of the caller.\n      (Naturally,\
    \ not all numbers are reachable from everywhere, for a\n      variety of technical\
    \ and local policy reasons.  Also, a single\n      termination point may be reachable\
    \ from different networks and may\n      have multiple identifiers.)\n   Dial\
    \ string: \"Dial strings\" are the actual numbers, symbols, and\n      pauses\
    \ entered by a user to place a phone call.  A dial string is\n      consumed by\
    \ one or more network entities and understood in the\n      context of the configuration\
    \ of these entities.  It is used to\n      generate an address-of-record or identifier\
    \ (in the sense\n      described above) so that a call can be routed.  Dial strings\
    \ may\n      require prepended digits to exit the private branch exchange (PBX)\n\
    \      the end system is connected to, and they may include post-dial\n      dual-tone\
    \ multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling that could control an\n      interactive voice\
    \ response (IVR) system or reach an extension.\n      Dial strings are beyond\
    \ the scope of this document.\n   Both approaches can be expressed as a URI. \
    \ For dial strings, this\n   URI is passed to an entity that can reproduce the\
    \ actions specified\n   in the dial string.  For example, in an analog phone system,\
    \ a dialer\n   translates the dial string into a sequence of actions such as waiting\n\
    \   for dial tone, sending DTMF digits, pausing, and generating post-dial\n  \
    \ DTMF digits after the callee picks up.  In an integrated services\n   digital\
    \ network (ISDN) or ISDN user part (ISUP) environment, the\n   signaling elements\
    \ that receive protocol messages containing the dial\n   string perform the appropriate\
    \ protocol actions.  As noted, this\n   approach is beyond the scope of this specification.\n\
    \   The approach described here has the URI specify the telephone number\n   as\
    \ an identifier, which can be either globally unique or only valid\n   within\
    \ a local context.  The dialling application is aware of the\n   local context,\
    \ knowing, for example, whether special digits need to\n   be dialed to seize\
    \ an outside line; whether network, pulse, or tone\n   dialling is needed; and\
    \ what tones indicate call progress.  The\n   dialling application then converts\
    \ the telephone number into a dial\n   sequence and performs the necessary signaling\
    \ actions.  The dialer\n   does not have to be a user application as found in\
    \ traditional\n   desktop operating systems but could well be part of an IP-to-PSTN\n\
    \   gateway.\n   To reach a telephone number from a phone on a PBX, for example,\
    \ the\n   user of that phone has to know how to convert the telephone number\n\
    \   identifier into a dial string appropriate for that phone.  The\n   telephone\
    \ number itself does not convey what needs to be done for a\n   particular terminal.\
    \  Instructions may include dialling \"9\" before\n   placing a call or prepending\
    \ \"00\" to reach a number in a foreign\n   country.  The phone may also need\
    \ to strip area and country codes.\n   The identifier approach described in this\
    \ document has the\n   disadvantage that certain services, such as electronic\
    \ banking or\n   voicemail, cannot be specified in a \"tel\" URI.\n   The notation\
    \ for phone numbers in this document is similar to that in\n   RFC 3191 [RFC3191]\
    \ and RFC 3192 [RFC3192].  However, the syntax\n   differs as this document describes\
    \ URIs whereas RFC 3191 and RFC 3192\n   specify electronic mail addresses.  RFC\
    \ 3191 and RFC 3192 use \"/\" to\n   indicate parameters (qualifiers).  Since\
    \ URIs use the forward slash\n   to describe path hierarchy, the URI scheme described\
    \ here uses the\n   semicolon, in keeping with Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\
    \ URI\n   conventions [RFC3261].\n   The \"tel\" URI can be used as a request\
    \ URI in SIP [RFC3261] requests.\n   The SIP specification also inherits the 'subscriber'\
    \ part of the\n   syntax as part of the 'user element' in the SIP URI.  Other\
    \ protocols\n   may also use this URI scheme.\n   The \"tel\" URI does not specify\
    \ the call type, such as voice, fax, or\n   data call, and does not provide the\
    \ connection parameters for a data\n   call.  The type and parameters are assumed\
    \ to be negotiated either\n   in-band by the telephone device or through a signaling\
    \ protocol such\n   as SIP.\n   This document obsoletes RFC 2806.\n"

  - "3.  URI Syntax\n   The URI is defined using the ABNF (augmented Backus-Naur form)\n\
    \   described in RFC 2234 [RFC2234] and uses elements from the core\n   definitions\
    \ (appendix A of RFC 2234).\n   The syntax definition follows RFC 2396 [RFC2396],\
    \ indicating the\n   actual characters contained in the URI.  If the reserved\
    \ characters\n   \"+\", \";\", \"=\", and \"?\" are used as delimiters between\
    \ components of\n   the \"tel\" URI, they MUST NOT be percent encoded.  These\
    \ characters\n   MUST be percent encoded if they appear in tel URI parameter values.\n\
    \   Characters other than those in the \"reserved\" and \"unsafe\" sets (see\n\
    \   RFC 2396 [RFC2396]) are equivalent to their \"% HEX HEX\" percent\n   encoding.\n\

- title: 5.1.5.  Local Numbers
  contents:
  - "5.1.5.  Local Numbers\n   Local numbers are unique only within a certain geographical\
    \ area or a\n   certain part of the telephone network, e.g., a private branch\n\
    \   exchange (PBX), a state or province, a particular local exchange\n   carrier,\
    \ or a particular country.  URIs with local phone numbers\n   should only appear\
    \ in environments where all local entities can\n   successfully set up the call\
    \ by passing the number to the dialling\n   software.  Digits needed for accessing\
    \ an outside line, for example,\n   are not included in local numbers.  Local\
    \ numbers SHOULD NOT be used\n   unless there is no way to represent the number\
    \ as a global number.\n   Local numbers SHOULD NOT be used for several reasons.\
    \  Local numbers\n   require that the originator and recipient are configured\n\
    \   appropriately so that they can insert and recognize the correct\n   context\
    \ descriptors.  Since there is no algorithm to pick the same\n   descriptor independently,\
    \ labelling numbers with their context\n   increases the chances of misconfiguration\
    \ so that valid identifiers\n   are rejected by mistake.  The algorithm to select\
    \ descriptors was\n   chosen so that accidental collisions would be rare, but\
    \ they cannot\n   be ruled out.\n   Local numbers MUST have a 'phone-context'\
    \ parameter that identifies\n   the scope of their validity.  The parameter MUST\
    \ be chosen to\n   identify the local context within which the number is unique\n\
    \   unambiguously.  Thus, the combination of the descriptor in the\n   'phone-context'\
    \ parameter and local number is again globally unique.\n   The parameter value\
    \ is defined by the assignee of the local number.\n   It does NOT indicate a prefix\
    \ that turns the local number into a\n   global (E.164) number.\n   There are\
    \ two ways to label the context:  via a global number or any\n   number of its\
    \ leading digits (e.g., \"+33\") and via a domain name,\n   e.g., \"houston.example.com\"\
    .  The choice between the two is left to\n   the \"owner\" of the local number\
    \ and is governed by whether there is a\n   global number or domain name that\
    \ is a valid identifier for a\n   particular local number.\n   The domain name\
    \ does not have to resolve to any actual host but MUST\n   be under the administrative\
    \ control of the entity managing the local\n   phone context.\n   A global number\
    \ context consists of the initial digits of a valid\n   global number.  All global\
    \ numbers with these initial digits must be\n   assigned to the same organization,\
    \ and no such matching number can be\n   used by any other organization.  For\
    \ example, +49-6151-16 would be a\n   suitable context for the Technical University\
    \ of Darmstadt, as it\n   uses all numbers starting with those digits.  If such\
    \ an initial\n   string of digits does not exist, the organization SHOULD use\
    \ the\n   lowest number of the global number range assigned to it.  (This can\n\
    \   occur if two organizations share the same decimal block of numbers.\n   For\
    \ example, assume an organization owns the number range +1-212-\n   555-0100 through\
    \ +1-212-555-0149.  +1-212-555-1 would not be a valid\n   global number context,\
    \ but +1-212-555-0100 would work.) It is not\n   required that local numbers within\
    \ the context actually begin with\n   the chosen set of initial numbers.\n   A\
    \ context consisting of the initial digits of a global number does\n   not imply\
    \ that adding these to the local number will generate a valid\n   E.164 number.\
    \  It might do so by coincidence, but this cannot be\n   relied upon.  (For example,\
    \ \"911\" should be labeled with the context\n   \"+1\", but \"+1-911\" is not\
    \ a valid E.164 number.)\n   National freephone numbers do not need a context,\
    \ even though they\n   are not necessarily reachable from outside a particular\
    \ country code\n   or numbering plan.  Recall that \"tel\" URIs are identifiers;\
    \ it is\n   sufficient that a global number is unique, but it is not required\n\
    \   that it be reachable from everywhere.\n      Even non-freephone numbers may\
    \ be out of date or may not be\n      reachable from a particular location.  For\
    \ example, premium\n      services such as \"900\" numbers in the North American\
    \ numbering\n      plan are often not dialable from outside the particular country\n\
    \      code.\n      The two label types were chosen so that, in almost all cases,\
    \ a\n      local administrator can pick an identifier that is reasonably\n   \
    \   descriptive and does not require a new IANA-managed assigned\n      number.\
    \  It is up to the administrator to assign an appropriate\n      identifier and\
    \ to use it consistently.  Often, an organization can\n      choose among several\
    \ different identifiers.\n   If the recipient of a \"tel\" URI uses it simply\
    \ for identification,\n   the receiver does not need to know anything about the\
    \ context\n   descriptor.  It simply treats it as one part of a globally unique\n\
    \   identifier, with the other being the local number.  If a recipient of\n  \
    \ the URI intends to place a call to the local number, it MUST\n   understand\
    \ the context and be able to place calls within that\n   context.\n"

- title: 7.1.  Why Not Just Put Telephone Numbers in SIP URIs?
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Why Not Just Put Telephone Numbers in SIP URIs?\n   The \"tel\" URI describes\
    \ a service, reaching a telephone number, that\n   is independent of the means\
    \ of doing so, be it via a SIP-to-PSTN\n   gateway, a direct SIP call via E.164\
    \ number (\"ENUM\") translation\n   [RFC3761], some other signaling protocols\
    \ such as H.323, or a\n   traditional circuit-switched call initiated on the client\
    \ side via,\n   say, the Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI). \
    \ Thus,\n   in spirit, it is closer to the URN schemes that also leave the\n \
    \  resolution to an external mechanism.  The same \"tel\" URI may get\n   translated\
    \ to any number of other URIs in the process of setting up\n   the call.\n"
- title: 7.2.  Why Not Distinguish between Call Types?
  contents:
  - "7.2.  Why Not Distinguish between Call Types?\n   Signaling protocols such as\
    \ SIP allow negotiating the call type and\n   parameters, making the very basic\
    \ indication within the URI scheme\n   moot.  Also, since the call type can change\
    \ frequently, any such\n   indication in a URI is likely to be out of date.  If\
    \ such designation\n   is desired for a device that directly places calls without\
    \ a\n   signaling protocol such as SIP, mechanisms such as the \"type\"\n   attribute\
    \ for the \"A\" element in HTML may be more appropriate.\n"
- title: 7.3.  Why "tel"?
  contents:
  - "7.3.  Why \"tel\"?\n   \"tel\" was chosen because it is widely recognized that\
    \ none of the\n   other suggestions appeared appropriate.  \"Callto\" was discarded\n\
    \   because URI schemes locate a resource and do not specify an action to\n  \
    \ be taken.  \"Telephone\" and \"phone\" were considered too long and not\n  \
    \ easily recognized internationally.\n"

- title: 9.  Use of "tel" URIs with SIP (Informative)
  contents:
  - "9.  Use of \"tel\" URIs with SIP (Informative)\n   SIP can use the \"tel\" URI\
    \ anywhere a URI is allowed, for example as a\n   Request-URI, along with \"sip\"\
    \ and \"sips\" URIs.  For brevity, we will\n   imply \"sips\" URIs when talking\
    \ about SIP URIs.  Both \"tel\" and SIP\n   URIs can contain telephone numbers.\
    \  In SIP URIs, they appear as the\n   user part, i.e., before the @ symbol (section\
    \ 19.1.6 in [RFC3261]).\n   Unless a SIP UA connects directly to a PSTN gateway,\
    \ one of the SIP\n   proxy servers has to translate the \"tel\" URI to a SIP URI,\
    \ with the\n   host part of that URI pointing to a gateway.  Typically, the outbound\n\
    \   proxy server, as the first proxy server visited by a call request,\n   performs\
    \ this translation.  A proxy server can translate all \"tel\"\n   URIs to the\
    \ same SIP host name or select a different gateway for\n   different \"tel\" prefixes,\
    \ based, for example, on information learned\n   from TRIP [RFC3219].  However,\
    \ a proxy server could also delegate\n   this translation task to any other proxy\
    \ server, as proxy servers are\n   free to apply whatever routing logic they desire.\
    \  For local numbers,\n   the proxy MUST NOT translate \"tel\" URIs whose contexts\
    \ it does not\n   understand.\n   As noted earlier, all phone numbers MUST use\
    \ the global form unless\n   they cannot be represented as such.  If the local-number\
    \ format is\n   used, it MUST be qualified by the 'phone-context' parameter.\n\
    \   Effectively, the combination of local number and phone context makes\n   the\
    \ \"tel\" URI globally unique.\n   Although web pages, vCard business cards, address\
    \ books, and\n   directories can easily contain global \"tel\" URIs, users on\
    \ twelve-\n   button (IP) phones cannot dial such numbers directly and are\n \
    \  typically accustomed to dialling shorter strings, e.g., for PBX\n   extensions\
    \ or local numbers.  These so-called dial strings (section\n   1) are not directly\
    \ represented by \"tel\" URIs, as noted.  We refer to\n   the rules that govern\
    \ the translation of dial strings into SIP and\n   \"tel\" URIs, global or local,\
    \ as the dial plan.  Currently,\n   translations from dial strings to \"tel\"\
    \ URIs have to take place in\n   end systems.  Future efforts may provide means\
    \ to carry dial strings\n   in a SIP URI, for example, but no such mechanisms\
    \ exist as of this\n   writing.\n   A SIP UA can use a dial plan to translate\
    \ dial strings into SIP or\n   \"tel\" URIs.  The dial plan can be manually configured\
    \ or, preferably,\n   downloaded as part of a device configuration mechanism.\
    \  (At this\n   time, there is no standardized mechanism for this.)\n   A mobile\
    \ user can use at least two dial plans, namely the dial plan\n   for the network\
    \ that he is currently visiting and the dial plan for\n   his home network.  Generally,\
    \ dialed numbers meant to represent\n   global numbers will look the same after\
    \ the translation regardless of\n   the dial plan, even if, say, the visited network\
    \ uses '0' for\n   dialling an 'outside' number and the user's home network uses\
    \ '9', as\n   long as the user is aware of the current dial plan.  However, local\n\
    \   extensions without a direct global equivalent may well behave\n   differently.\
    \  To avoid any ambiguity, the dial plan MUST insert a\n   suitable 'phone-context'\
    \ string when performing the translation.  If\n   the 'phone-context' is a domain\
    \ name, there are three cases:\n   1.  The outbound proxy recognizes the domain\
    \ name in the \"tel\" or SIP\n       URI as its local context and can route the\
    \ request to a gateway\n       that understands the local number.\n   2.  The\
    \ outbound proxy does not use the same phone context but can\n       route to\
    \ a proxy that handles this phone context.  This routing\n       can be done via\
    \ a lookup table, or the domain name of the phone\n       context might be set\
    \ up to reflect the SIP domain name of a\n       suitable proxy.  For example,\
    \ a proxy may always route calls with\n       \"tel\" URIs like\n          tel:1234;phone-context=munich.example.com\n\
    \       to the SIP proxy located at munich.example.com.  (Proxies\n       receiving\
    \ a tel URI with a context they do not understand are\n       obligated to return\
    \ a 404 (Not Found) status response so that an\n       outbound proxy may decide\
    \ to attempt such a heuristic.)\n   3.  The outbound proxy does not recognize\
    \ the phone context and\n       cannot find the appropriate proxy for that phone\
    \ context.  In\n       that case, the translation fails, and the outbound proxy\
    \ returns\n       a 404 (Not Found) error response.\n"

  contents:
  - "11.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations parallel those for\
    \ the mailto URL\n   [RFC2368].\n   Web clients and similar tools MUST NOT use\
    \ the \"tel\" URI to place\n   telephone calls without the explicit consent of\
    \ the user of that\n   client.  Placing calls automatically without appropriate\
    \ user\n   confirmation may incur a number of risks, such as those described\n\
    \   below:\n   o  Calls may incur costs.\n   o  The URI may be used to place malicious\
    \ or annoying calls.\n   o  A call will take the user's phone line off-hook, thus\
    \ preventing\n      its use.\n   o  A call may reveal the user's possibly unlisted\
    \ phone number to the\n      remote host in the caller identification data and\
    \ may allow the\n      attacker to correlate the user's phone number with other\n\
    \      information, such as an e-mail or IP address.\n   This is particularly\
    \ important for \"tel\" URIs embedded in HTML links,\n   as a malicious party\
    \ may hide the true nature of the URI in the link\n   text, as in\n   <a href=\"\
    tel:+1-900-555-0191\">Find free information here</a>\n   <a href=\"tel:+1-900-555-0191\"\
    >tel:+1-800-555-0191</a>\n   \"tel\" URIs may reveal private information, similar\
    \ to including phone\n   numbers as text.  However, the presence of the tel: schema\
