- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Effective telecommunications capabilities can be imperative\
    \ to\n   facilitate immediate recovery operations for serious disaster events,\n\
    \   such as, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and terrorist attacks.\n   Disasters\
    \ can happen unexpectedly, at any time or place.  Quick\n   response for recovery\
    \ operations requires immediate access to any\n   public telecommunications capabilities\
    \ at hand.  These capabilities\n   include:  conventional telephone, cellular\
    \ phones, and Internet\n   access via online terminals, IP telephones, and wireless\
    \ Personal\n   Digital Assistants (PDAs).  The commercial telecommunications\n\
    \   infrastructure is rapidly evolving to Internet-based technology.\n   Therefore,\
    \ the Internet community needs to consider how it can best\n   support emergency\
    \ management and recovery operations.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [1].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Problem
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Problem\n   Standards have been developed by other standards bodies concerning\n\
    \   emergency communications.  As discussed in [3], some of these\n   standards,\
    \ such as T1.631 [5], define specific indicators or labels\n   for emergency communications\
    \ in Signaling System 7 (SS7) networks.\n   Certain requirements must be defined\
    \ in order to achieve peering\n   across hybrid networks (networks that communicate\
    \ between IP and\n   other types of networks, such as that realized by the Public\
    \ Switched\n   Telephone Network) in order to achieve an interworking of services.\n"
- title: 2.  Scope
  contents:
  - "2.  Scope\n   [3] has defined a set of general system requirements to support\n\
    \   Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS).  This document defines an\n  \
    \ additional set of system requirements to achieve support for ETS\n   within\
    \ the specific context of IP telephony (note that this document\n   views IP telephony\
    \ within the context of an end-to-end application\n   layer service).  Solutions\
    \ to requirements are not defined.  The\n   document does not specify protocol\
    \ enhancements or specifications.\n   Note that [4], Requirements for Resource\
    \ Priority Mechanisms for the\n   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), is an RFC\
    \ that shares some overlap\n   with this document.  However, [4] only applies\
    \ to SIP and is not\n   meant to be applied to a more general perspective of IP\
    \ telephony as\n   it relates to ETS.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Out of Scope
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Out of Scope\n   An item that is not in scope of this document is mandating\
    \ acceptance\n   and support of the requirements presented in this document. \
    \ The IETF\n   does not mandate requirements or capabilities to independent networks\n\
    \   that comprise the Internet.  As an example, Internet Service\n   Providers\
    \ (ISP) may choose not to operate any telephony-related\n   gateways or services.\
    \  The IETF cannot and does not mandate that an\n   ISP deploy either telephony-related\
    \ gateways or telephony-related\n   services.  There is an expectation that business\
    \ contracts, for\n   example Service Level Agreements (SLA), will be used to satisfy\
    \ those\n   following requirements that apply to service providers.  Absence of\n\
    \   an SLA implies best effort service is provided.\n   It is assumed that some\
    \ ISPs will choose to offer ETS services and\n   that other carriers will choose\
    \ not to offer ETS services.  These\n   requirements do not apply to ISPs that\
    \ have chosen not to offer ETS\n   services.\n"
- title: 3.  IP Telephony Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  IP Telephony Requirements\n   The requirements in this section relate only\
    \ to Telephony Signaling\n   as used in Internet-based telephony services.  They\
    \ are an extension\n   to the general requirements specified in [3].  The following\n\
    \   requirements explicitly do not relate to IP-layer mechanisms, such as\n  \
    \ Differentiated Services or Integrated Services.\n   1) Telephony signaling applications\
    \ used with Internet-based\n      telephony MUST be able to carry labels.\n  \
    \ 2) The ability to carry labels MUST be extensible to support various\n     \
    \ types and numbers of labels.  A single binary value will not be\n      sufficient\
    \ given the various labeling standards in existence\n      today.\n   3) Telephony\
    \ signaling labels SHOULD have a mapping with the various\n      emergency related\
    \ labels/markings used in other telephony based\n      networks, such as the Public\
    \ Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).\n      This ensures that a telephone call\
    \ placed over a hybrid\n      infrastructure (traditional PSTN over some portion(s)\
    \ of the path,\n      Internet telephony over some other portion(s) of the path)\
    \ can\n      carry the labels end-to-end with appropriate translation at\n   \
    \   PSTN/Internet boundaries.  Absence of a mapping means that the\n      signaling\
    \ reverts to a default service (presumably one attributed\n      to the general\
    \ public).\n   4) Application layer IP telephony capabilities MUST NOT preclude\
    \ the\n      ability to do application layer accounting.\n      Accounting is\
    \ a useful feature in support of billing and tracking\n      down abuse of service.\
    \  If specific solutions or protocols in\n      support of ETS require accounting,\
    \ then this will be articulated\n      in future document(s).\n   5) Application\
    \ layer mechanisms in gateways and stateful proxies that\n      are specifically\
    \ in place to recognize ETS type labels MUST be\n      able to support \"best\
    \ available\" service (this will probably be\n      realized as better than best\
    \ effort).  These labels MAY exist in\n      the application layer headers of\
    \ data (i.e., bearer) traffic or\n      signaling traffic used for call completion.\n\
    \      The support for best available service SHOULD focus on probability\n  \
    \    of forwarding packets.  Probability MAY reach 100% depending on\n      the\
    \ local policy associated with the label.  Local policy MUST\n      also be used\
    \ to determine if better than best effort is to be\n      applied to a specific\
    \ label (or related set of labels).\n      Additional comments on this topic are\
    \ presented below in item 2 of\n      section 4.\n      The above paragraphs MUST\
    \ be taken in their entirety.  The ability\n      to support best available service\
    \ does not mean that the\n      application layer mechanism is expected to be\
    \ activated.  Further,\n      we do not define the means by which best available\
    \ service is\n      realized.  Application layer mechanisms that do not recognize\
    \ ETS\n      type labels are not subject to this requirement.\n"
- title: 4.  Issues
  contents:
  - "4.  Issues\n   This section presents issues that arise in considering solutions\
    \ for\n   the telephony requirements that have been defined for ETS.  This\n \
    \  section does not specify solutions, nor is it to be confused with\n   requirements.\
    \  Subsequent documents that articulate a more specific\n   set of requirements\
    \ for a particular service may make a statement\n   about the following issues.\n\
    \   1) Alternate paths\n      Experience with The Government Emergency Telecommunications\n\
    \      Service (GETS) over the PSTN has shown the utility of alternate\n     \
    \ paths to a destination to help facilitate emergency-related\n      communications.\
    \  From the perspective of the Internet, this\n      utility may be difficult\
    \ to achieve and have a more limited\n      benefit.  Unlike the PSTN, which creates\
    \ a fixed path during call\n      setup phase, the Internet uses dynamic routing\
    \ for IP packets.\n      This dynamic routing capability automatically causes\
    \ IP packets to\n      travel the best current path.  The Internet network infrastructure\n\
    \      does not have the concept of a \"call\" or the concept of \"call\n    \
    \  setup\", though IP telephony applications might have application\n      layer\
    \ awareness of calls or the call setup concept.\n   2) Application of Best Available\
    \ Service\n      In item 5 of section 3 above, we discuss the requirement of\n\
    \      supporting best available service.  We note that in this document,\n  \
    \    the scope of that support is constrained to the application layer\n     \
    \ and flows that traverse that layer.  This may involve direct\n      support\
    \ for the flow containing the ETS type label, or may involve\n      indirect support\
    \ (e.g., ETS labels in signaling messages that\n      cause an effect on corresponding\
    \ data or bearer flows).\n      It is critical to understand that how the support\
    \ for best\n      available service can be realized is outside the scope of this\n\
    \      document.  In addition, the perceived effectiveness of a given\n      approach\
    \ or implementation is also outside the scope of this\n      document.\n"
- title: 5.  Security
  contents:
  - "5.  Security\n   Only authorized users or operators SHOULD be able to create\
    \ non-\n   ordinary Labels (i.e., labels that may alter the default best effort\n\
    \   service).  Labels SHOULD be associated with mechanisms to provide\n   strong\
    \ end-to-end integrity during their transmission through the\n   telephony systems.\
    \  Finally, in cases where labels are expected to be\n   acted upon by operators,\
    \ these operators SHOULD have the capability\n   of authenticating the label on\
    \ a received message or transmission in\n   order to prevent theft of service\
    \ and reduce risk of denial of\n   service (e.g., by unauthorized users consuming\
    \ any limited\n   resources).\n   Security is also discussed in the general requirements\
    \ of [3], which\n   applies to section 3 above.\n"
