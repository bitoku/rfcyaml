  - "1.  Introduction\n   Multimedia applications often suffer from packet losses\
    \ in IP\n   networks.  In order to get a reasonable degree of quality when there\n\
    \   is packet loss, it is necessary to have loss concealment mechanisms\n   at\
    \ the decoder.  Video loss concealment is a range of techniques to\n   mask the\
    \ effects of packet loss in video communications.\n   In some applications, reporting\
    \ the information of receivers applying\n   video loss concealment could give\
    \ monitors or senders useful\n   information on the Quality of Experience (QoE)\
    \ of the application.\n   One example is no-reference video quality evaluation.\
    \  Video probes\n   located upstream from the video endpoint or terminal may not\
    \ see loss\n   occurring between the probe and the endpoint, and also may not\
    \ be\n   fully aware of the specific loss concealment methods being\n   dynamically\
    \ applied by the video endpoint.  Evaluating error\n   concealment is important\
    \ in this circumstance to estimate the\n   subjective impact of impairments.\n\
    \   This document defines one new block type for video loss concealment\n   to\
    \ augment those defined in [RFC3611] and [RFC7294] for use in a\n   range of RTP\
    \ video applications.  The metrics defined in this\n   document belong to the\
    \ class of transport-related terminal metrics\n   defined in [RFC6792].\n"
- title: 1.1.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports
  contents:
  - "1.1.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports\n   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in\
    \ [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]\n   defines an extensible structure for reporting using\
    \ an RTCP Extended\n   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report\
    \ block that\n   is used as defined in [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].\n"
- title: 1.2.  Performance Metrics Framework
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Performance Metrics Framework\n   The Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390]\
    \ provides guidance on the\n   definition and specification of performance metrics.\
    \  The RTP\n   monitoring framework [RFC6792] provides guidelines for the reporting\n\
    \   block format using RTCP XR.  The XR block type described in this\n   document\
    \ is in accordance with the guidelines in [RFC6390] and\n   [RFC6792].\n"
- title: 1.3.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Applicability\n   These metrics are applicable to video applications the\
    \ video\n   component of audio/video applications using RTP and applying packet\n\
    \   loss concealment mechanisms that are incorporated into the receiving\n   endpoint\
    \ to mitigate the impact of network impairments on QoE.  For\n   example, in an\
    \ IPTV system, set-top boxes could use this RTCP XR\n   block to report loss and\
    \ loss concealment metrics to an IPTV\n   management system to enable the service\
    \ provider to monitor the\n   quality of the IPTV service being delivered to end\
    \ users.\n"

- title: 3.  Video Loss Concealment Methods
  contents:
  - "3.  Video Loss Concealment Methods\n   Video loss concealment mechanisms can\
    \ be classified into 4 types as\n   follows:\n   a) Frame freeze\n      The impaired\
    \ video frame is not displayed; instead, the previously\n      displayed frame\
    \ is frozen for the duration of the loss event.\n   b) Interframe extrapolation\n\
    \      If an area of the video frame is damaged by loss, the same area\n     \
    \ from the previous frame(s) can be used to estimate what the\n      missing pixels\
    \ would have been.  This can work well in a scene\n      with no motion but can\
    \ be very noticeable if there is significant\n      movement from one frame to\
    \ another.  Simple decoders can simply\n      reuse the pixels that were in the\
    \ missing area, while more complex\n      decoders can try to use several frames\
    \ to do a more complex\n      extrapolation.  Another example of a sophisticated\
    \ form of\n      interframe repair is to estimate the motion of the damaged region\n\
    \      based on the motion of surrounding regions, and use that to select\n  \
    \    what part of the previous frame to use for repair.  Some important\n    \
    \  frames, such as Instantaneous Decoding Refresh (IDR) frames, may\n      not\
    \ depend on any other frames and may be involved in a scene\n      change.  Using\
    \ the interframe extrapolation method to conceal the\n      loss of these frames\
    \ may not obtain a satisfactory result.\n   c) Interpolation\n      A decoder\
    \ uses the undamaged pixels in the video frame to estimate\n      what the missing\
    \ block of pixels should have.\n   d) Error-resilient encoding\n      The sender\
    \ encodes the message in a redundant way so that the\n      receiver can correct\
    \ errors using the redundant information.\n      There are usually two kinds of\
    \ error-resilient encoding: One is\n      that the redundant data useful for error\
    \ resiliency performed at\n      the decoder can be embedded into the compressed\
    \ image/video\n      bitstream.  The other is encoding at the bitstream level,\
    \ e.g.,\n      Forward Error Correction (FEC).\n   Usually, methods b, c, and\
    \ d are deployed together to provide\n   comprehensive loss concealment in complex\
    \ decoders, while method a is\n   relatively independent and may be applied in\
    \ some simple decoders.\n   Moreover, the frame-freeze method repairs video based\
    \ on frames,\n   while the other methods repair video based on fine-grained elements,\n\
    \   such as macroblocks or bitstreams; this will cause the measurement\n   metrics\
    \ of frame-freeze and the other methods to be slightly\n   different.  Thus, In\
    \ this document, we differentiate between frame-\n   freeze and the other 3 loss\
    \ concealment mechanisms.\n"

  - "4.  Video Loss Concealment Report Block\n   This block reports the video loss\
    \ concealment metrics to complement\n   the audio metrics defined in [RFC7294].\
    \  The report block MUST be\n   sent in conjunction with the information from\
    \ the Measurement\n   Information Block [RFC6776].  Instances of this metric block\

    \   Information Block [RFC6776].  The Video Loss Concealment Report Block\n  \
    \ relies on the measurement period in the Measurement Information Block\n   indicating\
    \ the span of the report.  If the measurement period is not\n   received in the\
    \ same compound RTCP packet as this metric block, this\n   metric block MUST be\

    \ on which the loss concealment method corresponding to the\n      Video Loss\

    \ is unavailable.\n   Mean Frame-Freeze Duration: 32 bits\n      Mean Frame-Freeze\
    \ Duration is the mean duration, expressed in\n      units of RTP timestamp from\
    \ the sending side of the reporting\n      block, of the frame-freeze events.\
    \  The value of Mean Frame-Freeze\n      Duration is calculated by summing the\
    \ total duration of all frame\n      freeze events and dividing by the number\
    \ of events.  This metric\n      is optional.  It only exists when Video Loss\
    \ Concealment Method\n      Type=10.\n   Mean Impaired Frame Proportion (MIFP):\

    \   method during the interval, expressed as a fixed-point number with\n     \
    \ the binary point at the left edge of the field.  It is calculated\n      by\
    \ summing the impaired proportion of each video frame and\n      dividing by the\

    \ as \"V\" in the\n      definition of \"Video Loss Concealment Method Type\"\
    ) was applied\n      during the interval, expressed as a fixed-point number with\
    \ the\n      binary point at the left edge of the field.  It is calculated by\n\
    \      summing the concealed proportion of each video frame and dividing\n   \
    \   by the number of frames during this period.  The concealed\n      proportion\
    \ of each video frame is obtained by dividing the number\n      of concealed macroblocks\
    \ from this video frame by the total\n      macroblock number of the video frame,\
    \ which is equivalent to\n      multiplying the result of the division by 256,\
    \ limiting the\n      maximum value to 255 (to avoid overflow), and taking the\
    \ integer\n      part.\n      When calculating the MCFP, a value of 0xFF SHOULD\
    \ be used for a\n      lost frame that is totally concealed, and a value of 0\
    \ SHOULD be\n      used for the frame if there are no concealed macroblocks in\
    \ it.\n      For Video Loss Concealment Method Type=10, each frame covered in\n\
    \      the period of frame freeze is considered to be totally concealed;\n   \
    \   this means a value of 0xFF MUST be assigned.\n   Fraction of Frames Subject\
    \ to Concealment (FFSC): 8 bits\n      Fraction of Frames Subject to Concealment\
    \ is calculated by\n      dividing the number of frames to which loss concealment\
    \ (using\n      Video Loss Concealment Method Type) was applied by the total\n\
    \      number of frames and expressing this value as a fixed-point number\n  \
    \    with the binary point at the left edge of the field.  It is\n      equivalent\
    \ to multiplying the result of the division by 256,\n      limiting the maximum\
    \ value to 255 (to avoid overflow), and taking\n      the integer part.\n    \
    \  A value of 0 indicates that there were no concealed frames, and a\n      value\
    \ of 0xFF indicates that the frames in the entire measurement\n      interval\
    \ are all concealed.\n   Reserved: 8 bits\n      These bits are reserved for future\
