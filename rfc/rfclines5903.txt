Abstract This document describes three Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) groups for use in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and Internet Key Exchange version 2
(IKEv2) protocols in addition to previously defined groups.
These groups are based on modular arithmetic rather than binary arithmetic.
These groups are defined to align IKE and IKEv2 with other ECC implementations and standards, particularly NIST standards.
In addition, the curves defined here can provide more efficient implementation than previously defined ECC groups.
This document obsoletes RFC 4753.
This document describes default Diffie Hellman groups for use in IKE and IKEv2 in addition to the Oakley Groups included in [IKE] and the additional groups defined since [IANA IKE].
This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the IKE protocol and the concept of Oakley Groups, as defined in RFC 2409
RFC 2409 [IKE] defines five standard Oakley Groups: three modular exponentiation groups and two elliptic curve groups over GF[2^N].
One modular exponentiation group (768 bits Oakley Group 1) is mandatory for all implementations to support, while the other four are optional.
Nineteen additional groups subsequently have been defined and assigned values by IANA.
All of these additional groups are optional.
The purpose of this document is to expand the options available to implementers of elliptic curve groups by adding three ECP groups (elliptic curve groups modulo a prime).
The reasons for adding such groups include the following.
The groups proposed afford efficiency advantages in software applications since the underlying arithmetic is integer arithmetic modulo a prime rather than binary field arithmetic.
(Additional computational advantages for these groups are presented in [GMN].)
The groups proposed encourage alignment with other elliptic curve standards.
The proposed groups are among those standardized by NIST, the Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group (SECG), ISO, and ANSI.
(See Section 5 for details.)
The groups proposed are capable of providing security consistent with the Advanced Encryption Standard [AES].
In summary, due to the performance advantages of elliptic curve groups in IKE implementations and the need for further alignment with other standards, this document defines three elliptic curve groups based on modular arithmetic.
These groups were originally proposed in [RFC4753].
This document changes the format of the shared key produced by a Diffie Hellman exchange using these groups.
The shared key format used in this specification appeared earlier as an erratum to RFC 4753 [Err9], but some implementors of RFC 4753 were unaware of the erratum and did not implement the correction.
Implementations of RFC 4753 that incorporate the correction are interoperable with implementations of this specification.
However, there is a potential for interoperability problems between implementations of this specification and implementations of RFC 4753 that did not implement the correction from the erratum.
These problems could be difficult to detect and analyze since both use the same code point but the secret value (which is probably not available to the trouble desk) is computed differently.
Where peers are not interoperable, the initiator will never receive a response and eventually times out.
Section 9 provides more details of the changes from [RFC4753].
This document obsoletes RFC 4753 and addresses the erratum.
The key words "MUST" and "SHOULD" that appear in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
The notation adopted in RFC 2409 [IKE] is used below to describe the groups proposed.
256 Bit Random ECP Group IKE and IKEv2 implementations SHOULD support an ECP group with the following characteristics.
The curve is based on the integers modulo the generalized Mersenne prime p given by: p   2^(256) 2^(224) 2^(192) 2^(96)

The group was chosen verifiably at random using SHA 1 as specified in [IEEE 1363] from the seed:

Security Considerations Since this document proposes groups for use within IKE and IKEv2, many of the security considerations contained within [IKE] and [IKEv2] apply here as well.
The groups proposed in this document correspond to the symmetric key sizes 128 bits, 192 bits, and 256 bits.
This allows the IKE key exchange to offer security comparable with the AES algorithms [AES].
The following table summarizes the appearance of these three elliptic curve groups in other standards.
[ISO 14888 3], [ISO 15946 2], [ISO 15946 3], and [ISO 15946 4].
IANA Considerations IANA has updated its registries of Diffie Hellman groups for IKE in [IANA IKE] and for IKEv2 in [IANA IKEv2] to include the groups defined above.
In [IANA IKE], the groups appear as entries in the list of Diffie  Hellman groups given by Group Description (attribute class 4).
The descriptions are "256 bit random ECP group", "384 bit random ECP group", and "521 bit random ECP group".
In each case, the group type (attribute class 5) has the value 2 (ECP, elliptic curve group over GF[P]).
In [IANA IKEv2], the groups appear as entries in the list of IKEv2 transform type values for Transform Type 4
These entries in both [IANA IKE] and [IANA IKEv2] have been updated.
The update consisted of changing the reference from [RFC4753] to this document.
ECP Key Exchange Data Formats
In an ECP key exchange, the Diffie Hellman public value passed in a KE payload consists of two components, x and y, corresponding to the coordinates of an elliptic curve point.
Each component MUST have bit length as given in the following table.
This length is enforced, if necessary, by prepending the value with zeros.
The Diffie Hellman public value is obtained by concatenating the x and y values.
The Diffie Hellman shared secret value consists of the x value of the Diffie Hellman common value.
These formats should be regarded as specific to ECP curves and may not be applicable to EC2N (elliptic curve group over GF[2^N])
The following are examples of the IKEv2 key exchange payload for each of the three groups specified in this document.
We denote by g^n the scalar multiple of the point g by the integer n; it is another point on the curve.
In the literature, the scalar multiple is typically denoted ng; the notation g^n is used in order to conform to the notation used in [IKE] and [IKEv2].

Changes from RFC 4753 Section 7 (ECP Key Exchange Data Formats) of [RFC4753] states that The Diffie Hellman public value is obtained by concatenating the x and y values.
The format of the Diffie Hellman shared secret value is the same as that of the Diffie Hellman public value.
This document replaces the second of these two paragraphs with the following: The Diffie Hellman shared secret value consists of the x value of the Diffie Hellman common value.
This change aligns the ECP key exchange format with that used in other standards.
This change appeared earlier as an erratum to RFC 4753 [Err9].
This document obsoletes RFC 4753 and addresses the erratum.
Section 8 (Test Vectors) of [RFC4753] provides three examples of Diffie Hellman key agreement using the ECP groups.
This document changes the last paragraph of each subsection of Section 8 to reflect the new format.
