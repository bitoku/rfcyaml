  - "1.  Introduction\n   When experimenting with a protocol or defining a new extension
    to a\n   protocol, one needs either a protocol number, a new message, or an\n
    \  option to carry the information related to the experiment.  Most\n   implementations
    end up using unassigned values for the new messages.\n   Many times this creates
    problems when the same value is assigned\n   through the IETF standards action,
    by IANA, or if the implementation\n   gets deployed with these messages.  Therefore,
    it is considered a\n   good practice to set aside some code points that identify
    the\n   experimental protocols or messages for experimental purposes.  The\n   need
    for experimental messages is shown in [3].\n   This document defines new messages
    for experimenting with extensions\n   to the Mobile IPv6 protocol.  These messages
    should be strictly used\n   for experiments.  Experiments that are successful
    should be\n   standardized in the IETF.  An implementation MUST NOT be released
    or\n   deployed with the experimental messages.\n   This document defines a new
    Mobility Header message, which is the\n   Experimental Mobility message that can
    be sent at any time by the\n   mobile node, the home agent or the correspondent
    node.  Since\n   Mobility Header messages cannot be combined and sent in one packet,\n
    \  there is always only one Mobility Header message in any Mobile IPv6\n   packet.
    \ Home agent or correspondent node implementations that do not\n   recognize the
    mobility message type, discard the message and send a\n   Binding Error message
    as described in [2], with the Status field set\n   to 2 (unrecognized MH Type
    value).  Mobile nodes that do not\n   recognize the mobility message type should
    discard the message and\n   send an ICMP Parameter problem with code 0.\n   This
    document also defines a new mobility option, the Experimental\n   Mobility option,
    which can be carried in any Mobility Header message.\n   Mobility options, by
    definition, can be skipped if an implementation\n   does not recognize the mobility
    option type [2].\n   The messages defined in this document can also be used for
    Network\n   Mobility (NEMO) [4] and Proxy Mobile IPv6 [5] since these protocols\n
    \  also use Mobility Header messages.\n   Experimental code points could potentially
    disrupt a deployed network\n   when experiments using these code points are performed
    in the\n   network.  Therefore, the network scope of support for experimental\n
    \  values should carefully be evaluated before deploying any experiment\n   across
    extended network domains, such as the public Internet.\n   Experimental mechanisms
    should only be used for actual\n   experimentation.  By design, only a single
    code point is allocated\n   for the message and another one for the option.  This
    limits the\n   number of experiments among a set of peers to one at a time.  When\n
    \  experimental mechanisms are shown to be useful, and there is a desire\n   to
    deploy them beyond the experiment they should be standardized and\n   given new
    code points.\n"

  - "3.  Experimental Mobility Header Message\n   The Experimental Mobility Header
    message is based on the Mobility\n   Header message defined in Section 6.1 of
    RFC 3775 [2].  There are no\n   fields in the message beyond the required fields
    in the Mobility\n   Header.  The 'MH Type' field in the Mobility Header indicates
    that it\n   is an Experimental Mobility Header message.\n   If no data is present
    in the message, two bytes of padding are\n   required.  The 'Header Len' field
    in the Mobility Header is set to 0\n   since the first 8 octets are excluded while
    calculating the length of\n   the Mobility Header message.\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Protection for the Experimental Mobility Header
    message and Mobility\n   option depends on the experiment that is being carried
    out and the\n   kind of information that is being carried in the messages.  If
    these\n   messages carry information that should not be revealed on the wire,\n
    \  or that can affect the binding cache entry at the home agent or the\n   correspondent
    node, they should be protected in a manner similar to\n   Binding Updates and
    Binding Acknowledgements.\n   Security analyzers such as firewalls and network
    intrusion detection\n   monitors often rely on unambiguous interpretations of
    the fields\n   described in this document.  As new values for the fields are\n
    \  assigned, existing security analyzers that do not understand the new\n   values
    may fail, resulting in either loss of connectivity, if the\n   analyzer declines
    to forward the unrecognized traffic, or in loss of\n   security if it does forward
    the traffic and the new values are used\n   as part of an attack.\n   When experimental
    code points are deployed within an administratively\n   self-contained network
    domain, it must be ensured that each code\n   point is used consistently to avoid
    interference between experiments.\n   When experimental code points are used in
    traffic that crosses\n   multiple administrative domains, the experimenters should
    assume that\n   there is a risk that the same code points will be used simultaneously\n
    \  by other experiments and that there is a possibility that the\n   experiments
    will interfere.  Particular attention should be given to\n   security threats
    that such interference might create.  Please see RFC\n   4727 for more details
    [6].\n"

    in Section 3, has\n   been assigned the type value (11), allocated from the same
    space as\n   the 'MH Type' field in the Mobility Header [2].\n   The Experimental
    Mobility option, defined in Section 4, has been\n   assigned the type value (18),
    allocated from the same space as\n   Mobility Options [2].\n"
