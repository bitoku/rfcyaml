  - "1.  Introduction\n   Although electronic mail is preferable as a means of third-party\n\
    \   communication, in some cases it may be necessary to print\n   information,\
    \ in hard-copy form, at a remote location.  The remote\n   output device may consist\
    \ of a standard line printer, a printer with\n   multiple fonts and faces, a printer\
    \ that can reproduce graphics, or a\n   facsimile device.  Remote output may be\
    \ accompanied by information\n   that identifies the intended recipient.  This\
    \ memo describes a\n   technique for \"remote printing\" using the Internet mail\n\
    \   infrastructure.  In particular, this memo focuses on the case in\n   which\
    \ remote printers are connected to the international telephone\n   network.  Furthermore,\
    \ it describes an experiment in remote printing.\n"
- title: 1.1.  The Advantage of a General-Purpose Infrastructure
  contents:
  - "1.1.  The Advantage of a General-Purpose Infrastructure\n   The experiment in\
    \ remote printing is about \"outreach\"; specifically,\n   integrating the e-mail\
    \ and facsimile communities.  By providing easy\n   access to remote printing\
    \ recipients, enterprise-wide access is\n   enhanced, regardless of kind of institution\
    \ (e.g., commercial,\n   educational, or government), or the size of institution\
    \ (e.g.,\n   global, regional, or local).  This approach at outreach allows an\n\
    \   organization to make it easier for the \"outside world\" to communicate\n\
    \   with the personnel in the organization who are users of facsimile but\n  \
    \ not e-mail; e.g., the sales person, the university registrar, or the\n   (elected)\
    \ official.  The ease in which the Internet mail\n   infrastructure can be used\
    \ to provide this facility is (yet) another\n   example of the power of a general-purpose\
    \ infrastructure.\n"
- title: 2.  Procedure
  contents:
  - "2.  Procedure\n   When information is to be remotely printed, the user application\n\
    \   constructs an RFC 822 [1] message, containing a \"Message-ID\" field\n   along\
    \ with a \"multipart/mixed\" content [2] having two parts, the\n   first being\
    \ a \"application/remote-printing\" content-type, and the\n   second being an\
    \ arbitrary content-type corresponding to the\n   information to be printed. \
    \ The message is then sent to the remote\n   printer server's electronic mail\
    \ address.\n   It should be noted that not all content-types have a natural printing\n\
    \   representation, e.g., an \"audio\" or \"video\" content.  For this\n   reason,\
    \ the second part of the \"multipart/mixed\" content should be\n   one of the\
    \ following:\n      text/plain, message/rfc822, application/postscript image/tiff\n\
    \      (defined in Appendix A), any multipart\n   Note that:\n   (1)  With the\
    \ \"text/plain\" content-type, not all character sets may\n        be available\
    \ for printing.\n   (2)  With the \"message\" content-type, the subordinate content\
    \ will be\n        processed recursively.\n   (3)  With the \"application/postscript\"\
    \ content-type, the remote\n        printer server should evaluate the contents\
    \ in a safe execution\n        environment.\n   (4)  With the \"multipart\" content-type\
    \ the subordinate contents will\n        be processed recursively: for a \"multipart/mixed\"\
    \ or\n        \"multipart/digest\" content, each subordinate content will start\n\
    \        on a new page, whilst for a \"multipart/parallel\" content, all\n   \
    \     subordinate contents will, if possible, start on the same page.\n      \
    \  Naturally, when processing a \"multipart/alternative\" content,\n        only\
    \ one subordinate content will be printed.\n   When the remote printer server\
    \ finishes its processing, a message is\n   returned to the originator, indicating\
    \ either success or failure.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Naming, Addressing, and Routing
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Naming, Addressing, and Routing\n   A printer is identified by a telephone\
    \ number which corresponds to a\n   G3-facsimile device connected to the international\
    \ telephone network,\n   e.g.,\n        +1 415 968 2510\n   where \"+1\" indicates\
    \ the IDDD country code, and the remaining string\n   is a telephone number within\
    \ that country.  This number is used to\n   construct the address of a remote\
    \ printer server, which forms the\n   recipient address for the message, e.g.,\n\
    \        remote-printer@0.1.5.2.8.6.9.5.1.4.1.tpc.int\n   That is, the local-part\
    \ of the remote printer server's address is\n   ALWAYS \"remote-printer\", and\
    \ the domain-part is constructed by\n   reversing the telephone number, converting\
    \ each digit to a domain-\n   label, and being placed under \"tpc.int.\"\n   The\
    \ message is routed in exactly the same fashion as all other\n   electronic mail,\
    \ i.e., using the MX algorithm [3].  Since a remote\n   printer server might be\
    \ able to access many printers, the wildcarding\n   facilities of the DNS [4,5]\
    \ are used accordingly.  For example, if a\n   remote printer server residing\
    \ at \"dbc.mtview.ca.us\" was willing to\n   access any printer with a telephone\
    \ number prefix of\n        +1 415 968\n      then this resource record might\
    \ be present\n        *.8.6.9.5.1.4.1.tpc.int.    IN MX 10 dbc.mtview.ca.us.\n\
    \   Naturally, if several remote printer servers were willing to access\n   any\
    \ printer in that prefix, multiple MX resource records would be\n   present.\n\
    \   It should be noted that the presence of a wildcard RR which matches a\n  \
    \ remote printer server's address does not imply that the corresponding\n   telephone\
    \ number is valid, or, if valid, that a G3-facsimile device\n   is connected at\
    \ the phone number.\n"

- title: 2.4.  Remote Printing without MIME
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Remote Printing without MIME\n   If the originator's user agent doesn't\
    \ support MIME, (e.g., the\n   originator accesses the Internet mail infrastructure\
    \ via a gateway in\n   another mail dominion), then it is still possible for remote\
    \ printing\n   to occur, albeit in a more limited fashion.  Specifically, because\
    \ a\n   \"application/remote-printing\" content is not present, cover sheet\n\
    \   information must be derived from some other source; and, the message\n   body\
    \ will be treated as a \"text/plain\" content.\n   Typically, a cover sheet consists\
    \ of three sections:\n   o    information identifying the originator;\n   o  \
    \  information identifying the recipient; and,\n   o    additional information\
    \ supplied by the remote printer server.\n   To identify the originator, the remote\
    \ printer server will use the\n   message headers, usually by stripping any trace\
    \ headers (i.e.,\n   \"Received\" and \"Return-Path\") and then re-ordering the\
    \ remaining\n   headers starting with the \"From\" header.\n   To identify the\
    \ recipient, an alternative syntax is used for\n   recipient addressing, in which\
    \ the local-part of the remote printer\n   server's address consists of \"remote-printer\"\
    \ followed by an RFC 822\n   atom, e.g.,\n   remote-printer.Arlington_Hewes/Room_403@0.1.5.2.8.6.9.5.1.4.1.tpc.int\n\
    \   This mailbox syntax is purposefully restricted in the interests of\n   pragmatism.\n\
    \   The atom following \"remote-printer\" is considered an opaque string\n   for\
    \ use in recipient identification when generating a cover sheet.\n   To paraphrase\
    \ RFC 822, an atom is defined as:\n    atom    = 1*atomchar\n    atomchar=   <any\
    \ upper or lowercase alphabetic character (A-Z a-z)>\n              / <any digit\
    \ (0-9)>\n              / \"!\" / \"#\" / \"$\" / \"%\" / \"&\" / \"'\" / \"*\"\
    \ / \"+\"\n              / \"-\" / \"/\" / \"=\" / \"?\" / \"^\" / \"_\" / \"\
    `\" / \"{\"\n              / \"|\" / \"}\" / \"~\"\n   When generating a cover\
    \ sheet using this opaque string, the remote\n   printer server will interpret\
    \ an underscore character (\"_\") as a\n   space, and a solidus character (\"\
    /\") as an end-of-line sequence.  A\n   remote printer server will interpret two\
    \ consecutive underscore\n   characters in the opaque string as a single underscore,\
    \ and two\n   consecutive solidus characters as a single solidus.  So, the opaque\n\
    \   string,\n        Arlington_Hewes/Room_403\n   used in the example above might\
    \ appear on the cover sheet as\n        To: Arlington Hewes\n            Room\
    \ 403\n   Note that some Internet mail software (especially gateways from\n  \
    \ outside the Internet) impose stringent limitations on the size of a\n   mailbox-string.\
    \  Thus, originating user agents should take care in\n   limiting the local-part\
    \ to no more than 70 or so characters.\n   Note that by using the alternative\
    \ syntax for recipient addressing,\n   it is completely legal to send non- textual\
    \ messages in which the\n   cover sheet information is automatically derived --\
    \ simply by\n   including \"MIME-Version:\" and \"Content-Type:\" headers in the\
    \ message,\n   but omitting the initial \"application/remote-printing\" content,\
    \ e.g.,\n"

    \ printing, an\n   experiment is underway.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Infrastructure
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Infrastructure\n   The domain \"tpc.int.\" is being populated in order\
    \ to provide the MX-\n   based infrastructure for routing to a remote printer\
    \ server.  In\n   order to facilitate distributed operations, this domain is divided\n\
    \   into a zone for each IDDD country code.  Sites participating in the\n   experiment\
    \ contact the appropriate zone administrator in order to be\n   listed, by examining\
    \ the SOA resource record associated with the\n   zone.  For example, a site in\
    \ the Netherlands (IDDD country code 31)\n   would contact the zone administrator\
    \ for the domain \"1.3.tpc.int.\" in\n   order to be listed, e.g.,\n        %\
    \ dig 1.3.tpc.int. soa\n   Each zone administrator has a simple set of procedures\
    \ for listing a\n   participant.  For example, in the US (IDDD country code 1),\n\
    \   participating sites send an \"exchange file\" to the administrator,\n   which\
    \ indicates the prefixes that the site wishes to list.  The zone\n   administrator\
    \ for the domain \"1.tpc.int.\" merges the exchange files\n   from all participating\
    \ sites to create a zone for each area code.\n   These zones are then replicated\
    \ using the normal DNS zone transfer\n   procedures.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Zones
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Zones\n   It should be noted that zones under \"tpc.int\" are created\
    \ on the\n   basis of IDDD country codes and area codes; they are not created\
    \ for\n   each subdomain.  For example, in the US and Canada (IDDD country code\n\
    \   1), no more than one zone is allocated for each area code.  In\n   contrast,\
    \ for countries with a smaller numbering plan, only a single\n   zone, for the\
    \ whole country would be allocated.  For example, if Fiji\n   (IDDD country code\
    \ 679), were to join the experiment, then it is\n   likely that a single zone\
    \ would be added to the DNS, i.e.,\n   \"9.7.6.tpc.int.\"\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  MX records
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  MX records\n   The MX records present in a zone can have an arbitrary\
    \ level of\n   precision.  For example, the North American Numbering Plan (IDDD\n\
    \   country code 1) is structured by a 3-digit area code, followed by a\n   3-digit\
    \ exchange prefix, followed by a 4-digit station number.  As\n   such, one might\
    \ expect that MX records in this zone would be similar\n   to\n        *.5.1.4.1.tpc.int.\
    \          IN MX 10 dbc.mtview.ca.us.\n   which accessed any printer with a telephone\
    \ number prefix of\n        +1 415\n   (i.e., allowing access to any printer in\
    \ area code 415), or might be\n   similar to\n        *.8.6.9.5.1.4.1.tpc.int.\
    \    IN MX 10 dbc.mtview.ca.us.\n   (i.e., allowing access to any printer in area\
    \ code 415, exchange\n   prefix 968).\n   However, the level of precision is arbitrary.\
    \  For example, if all of\n   the printers in an organization had a telephone\
    \ number prefix of\n        +1 415 96\n   then an MX record such as\n        *.6.9.5.1.4.1.tpc.int.\

  - "4.  Future Issues\n   The experiment in remote printing described herein does\
    \ not address\n   several issues, e.g.,\n   o    determining which content-types\
    \ and character sets are\n        supported by a remote printer server;\n   o\
    \    introduction of authentication, integrity, privacy,\n        authorization,\
    \ and accounting services;\n   o    preferential selection of a remote printer\
    \ server; and,\n   o    aggregation of multiple print recipients in a single\n\
    \        message.\n   Initially, the experiment will not address these issues.\
    \  However,\n   subsequent work might consider these issues in detail.\n"

- title: Appendix B.  Uniform Addressing
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.  Uniform Addressing\n   A user may choose to include several recipients\
    \ in a message, one or\n   more of which may be recipients reached via remote\
    \ printing.\n   However, the message format accepted by a remote printer server\n\
    \   contains only a single recipient.\n   There are three solutions to this problem:\
    \ first, during composition,\n   a \"smart\" user agent can determine that one\
    \ or more remote printing\n   recipients are present, and submit the appropriate\
    \ messages.  This\n   has the disadvantage that the submission for the e-mail\
    \ recipients\n   does not contain any information about the remote-printing\n\
    \   recipients.\n   A second solution is to use the alternative syntax for recipient\n\
    \   addressing described in Section 2.4 -- however, this minimizes useful\n  \
    \ information available when constructing the cover sheet.\n   A third solution\
    \ is for a site participating as a client to offer a\n   remote printing recipient\
    \ exploder server to its users.  Each remote\n   printing recipient is assigned\
    \ a mailbox relative to the exploder,\n   and, as such, appears as an \"ordinary\"\
    \ e-mail address.  Using this\n   strategy, the user agent has no knowledge of\
    \ which recipients are\n   accessible via e-mail or remote-printing -- the user\
    \ simply specifies\n   a collection of mailbox recipients.  Those recipients which\
    \ are\n   accessible via remote-printing are automatically routed to the\n   exploder.\
    \  For each recipient in the envelope, a local database is\n   consulted to retrieve\
    \ addressing information for the recipient, and a\n   message is submitted to\
    \ the appropriate remote printer server.\n"
