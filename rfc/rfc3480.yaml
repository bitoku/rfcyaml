  title: Specification of Requirements
- contents:
  - "1. Overview\n   Supporting MPLS TE over unnumbered links (i.e., links that do
    not\n   have IP addresses) involves two components: (a) the ability to carry\n
    \  (TE) information about unnumbered links in IGP TE extensions (ISIS or\n   OSPF),
    and (b) the ability to specify unnumbered links in MPLS TE\n   signalling.  The
    former is covered in [GMPLS-ISIS, GMPLS-OSPF].  The\n   focus of this document
    is on the latter.\n   Current signalling used by MPLS TE does not provide support
    for\n   unnumbered links because the current signalling does not provide a\n   way
    to indicate an unnumbered link in its Explicit Route Objects.\n   This document
    proposes simple procedures and extensions that allow\n   CR-LDP signalling [CR-LDP]
    to be used with unnumbered links.\n"
  title: 1. Overview
- contents:
  - "2. Link Identifiers\n   An unnumbered link has to be a point-to-point link.  An
    LSR at each\n   end of an unnumbered link assigns an identifier to that link.
    \ This\n   identifier is a non-zero 32-bit number that is unique within the\n
    \  scope of the LSR that assigns it.  If one is using OSPF or ISIS as\n   the
    IGP in support of traffic engineering, then the IS-IS and/or OSPF\n   and CR-LDP
    modules on an LSR must agree on the identifiers.\n   There is no a priori relationship
    between the identifiers assigned to\n   a link by the LSRs at each end of that
    link.\n   LSRs at the two end points of an unnumbered link exchange with each\n
    \  other the identifiers they assign to the link.  Exchanging the\n   identifiers
    may be accomplished by configuration, by means of a\n   protocol such as LMP ([LMP]),
    by means of CR-LDP (especially in the\n   case where a link is a Forwarding Adjacency,
    see below), or by means\n   of IS-IS or OSPF extensions ([ISIS-GMPLS], [OSPF-GMPLS]).\n
    \  Consider an (unnumbered) link between LSRs A and B.  LSR A chooses an\n   identifier
    for that link.  So does LSR B.  From A's perspective, we\n   refer to the identifier
    that A assigned to the link as the \"link\n   local identifier\" (or just \"local
    identifier\"), and to the identifier\n   that B assigned to the link as the \"link
    remote identifier\" (or just\n   \"remote identifier\").  Likewise, from B's perspective,
    the identifier\n   that B assigned to the link is the local identifier, and the\n
    \  identifier that A assigned to the link is the remote identifier.\n   In the
    context of this document, the term \"Router ID\" means a stable\n   IP address
    of an LSR that is always reachable if there is any\n   connectivity to the LSR.
    \ This is typically implemented as a\n   \"loopback address\"; the key attribute
    is that the address does not\n   become unusable if an interface on the LSR is
    down.  In some cases,\n   this value will need to be configured.  If one is using
    OSPF or ISIS\n   as the IGP in support of traffic engineering, then it is RECOMMENDED\n
    \  for the Router ID to be set to the \"Router Address\" as defined in\n   [OSPF-TE],
    or \"Traffic Engineering Router ID\" as defined in [ISIS-\n   TE].\n   This section
    is equally applicable to the case of unnumbered\n   component links (see [LINK-BUNDLE]).\n"

  - "3. Unnumbered Forwarding Adjacencies\n   If an LSR that originates an LSP advertises
    this LSP as an unnumbered\n   Forwarding Adjacency in IS-IS or OSPF (see [LSP-HIER]),
    or the LSR\n   uses the Forwarding Adjacency formed by this LSP as an unnumbered\n
    \  component link of a bundled link (see [LINK-BUNDLE]), the LSR MUST\n   allocate
    an identifier to that Forwarding Adjacency (just like for\n   any other unnumbered
    link).  Moreover, the REQUEST message used for\n   establishing the LSP that forms
    the Forwarding Adjacency MUST contain\n   an LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID TLV (described
    below), with the LSR's\n   Router ID set to the head end's Router ID, and the
    Interface ID set\n   to the identifier that the LSR allocated to the Forwarding
    Adjacency.\n   If the REQUEST message contains the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID TLV,
    then\n   the tail-end LSR MUST allocate an identifier to that Forwarding\n   Adjacency
    (just like for any other unnumbered link).  Furthermore,\n   the MAPPING message
    for the LSP MUST contain an\n   LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID TLV, with the LSR's Router
    ID set to the\n   tail-end's Router ID, and the Interface ID set to the identifier\n
    \  allocated by the tail-end LSR.\n   For the purpose of processing the Explicit
    Route TLV and the\n   Interface ID TLV, an unnumbered Forwarding Adjacency is
    treated as an\n   unnumbered (TE) link or an unnumbered component link as follows.
    \ The\n   LSR that originates the Adjacency sets the link local identifier for\n
    \  that link to the value that the LSR allocates to that Forwarding\n   Adjacency,
    and the link remote identifier to the value carried in the\n   Interface ID field
    of the Reverse Interface ID TLV (for the\n   definition of Reverse Interface ID
    TLV see below).  The LSR that is a\n   tail-end of that Forwarding Adjacency sets
    the link local identifier\n   for that link to the value that the LSR allocates
    to that Forwarding\n   Adjacency, and the link remote identifier to the value
    carried in the\n   Interface ID field of the Forward Interface ID TLV (for the\n
    \  definition of Forward Interface ID see below).\n"
