- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Since the very first e-mail to fax gateway objects appeared,\
    \ a number\n   of different methods to specify a fax address as an e-mail address\n\
    \   have been used by implementors. Two major objectives for this were\n     -\
    \ enable an e-mail user to send faxes from his/her e-mail\n       interface;\n\
    \     - enable some kind of \"fax over e-mail service\" transport, to\n      \
    \ reduce the costs of fax transmissions, and use the existing\n       e-mail infrastructure.\n\
    \   This memo describes the MINIMAL addressing method and standard\n   extensions\
    \ to encode FAX addresses in e-mail addresses, as required\n   in reference [13].\
    \ The opposite problem, i.e. to allow a traditional\n   numeric-only fax device\
    \ user to access the e-mail transport service,\n   is not discussed here.\n  \
    \ All implementations supporting this FAX over e-mail address format\n   MUST\
    \ support as a minimum the specification described in this\n   document.  The\
    \ generic complex case of converting the whole PSTN\n   addressing in e-mail is\
    \ out of scope in this minimal specification:\n   there is some work in progress\
    \ in the field, where also a number of\n   standard optional extensions are being\
    \ defined.\n   In this document the formal definitions are described using ABNF\n\
    \   syntax, as defined into [7]. We will also use some of the \"CORE\n   DEFINITIONS\"\
    \ defined in \"APPENDIX A - CORE\" of that document. The\n   exact meaning of\
    \ the capitalised words\n      \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\",\n      \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\"\
    , \"OPTIONAL\"\n   is defined in reference [6].\n"
- title: 2. Minimal Fax address
  contents:
  - "2. Minimal Fax address\n   The \"service-selector\" defined in section 2 of reference\
    \ [13] for the\n   fax service is:\n      service-selector = \"FAX\"\n   The minimal\
    \ addressing for the fax service also requires support for\n   a \"qualif-type1\"\
    \ element (see section 2 of reference [13]).  This\n   element is an OPTIONAL\
    \ element of the fax address, but its support,\n   when present, is REQUIRED:\n\
    \      qualif-type1 = \"/\" t33-sep \"=\" sub-addr\n   where\n      t33-sep =\
    \ \"T33S\"\n      sub-addr = 1*( DIGIT )\n   Thus, the minimal specification of\
    \ a fax in e-mail address is:\n      fax-address = fax-mbox [ \"/T33S=\" sub-addr\
    \ ]\n      fax-mbox = \"FAX=\" global-phone\n   Note:\n     See section 4.1 in\
    \ case multiple sub-addr per fax-mbox need to be\n     specified.\n   The Minimal\
    \ supported syntax for global-phone (as described in\n   section reference [13])\
    \ is:\n   global-phone = \"+\" 1*( DIGIT , written-sep )\n   written-sep = ( \"\
    -\" / \".\" )\n   The use of other dialling schemas for PSTN numbers (like private\n\
    \   numbering plans or local dialling conventions) is also allowed.\n   However,\
    \ this does not preclude nor remove the minimal compulsory\n   requirement to\
    \ support the \"global-phone\" syntax as defined above.\n   Any non \"global-phone\"\
    \ dialling schema MUST NOT use the leading \"+\"\n   between the \"=\" sign and\
    \ the dialling string. The \"+\" sign is\n   strictly reserved for the standard\
    \ \"global-phone\" syntax.\n   Note:\n     The specification of these different\
    \ dialling schemas is out of\n     scope for this minimal specification.\n   User\
    \ specification of PSTN e-mail addresses will be facilitated if\n   they can insert\
    \ these separators between dial elements like digits\n   etc.  For this reason\
    \ we allow them in the syntax the written-sep\n   element.\n   Implementors' note:\n\
    \     Use of the written-sep elements is allowed, but not recommended.\n     Any\
    \ occurences of written-sep elements in a pstn-mbox MUST be\n     ignored by all\
    \ conformant implementations. User Agents SHOULD\n     remove written-sep elements\
    \ before submitting messages to the\n     Message Transport System.\n"

  contents:
  - "3. The e-mail address of the I-fax device: mta-I-fax\n   An \"I-fax device\"\
    \ has an e-mail address, or to be more exact, a name\n   which enables a mail\
    \ system to identify it on the e-mail global\n   system.\n   In Internet mail,\
    \ this is the Right Hand Side (RHS) part of the\n   address, i.e. the part on\
    \ the right of the \"@\" sign. We will call\n   this mta-I-fax\n      mta-I-fax\
    \ = domain\n   For \"domain\" strings used in SMTP transmissions, the string MUST\n\
    \   conform to the requirements of that standard's <domain>\n   specifications\
    \ [1], [3].  For \"domain\" strings used in message\n   content headers, the string\
    \ MUST conform to the requirements of the\n   relevant standards [2], [3].\n \
    \  Note: in both cases, the standards permit use of \"domain names\" or\n    \
    \     \"domain literals\" in addresses.\n"
- title: 4. The fax-email
  contents:
  - "4. The fax-email\n   The complete structure used to transfer a minimal FAX address\
    \ over\n   the Internet e-mail transport system is called \"fax-email\". This\n\
    \   object is an e-mail address which conforms to RFC822 [2] and RFC1123\n   [3]\
    \ \"addr-spec\" syntax, with some extra structure which allows the\n   FAX number\
    \ to be identified.\n         fax-email =  [\"/\"] fax-address [\"/\"] \"@\" mta-I-fax\n\
    \   Implementors' note:\n     The optional \"/\" characters can result from other\
    \ mail transport\n     services gateways, where it is also an optional element.\n\
    \     Implementations MUST accept the optional slashes but SHOULD NOT\n     generate\
    \ them. Gateways are allowed to strip them off when\n     converting to Internet\
    \ mail addressing.\n     It is essential to remind that \"fax-address\" element\
    \ MUST strictly\n     follow the \"quoting rules\" spcified in the relevant standards\
    \ [2],\n     [3]\n"

    \ note:\n     The UA could accept multiple subaddress elements for the same\n\
    \     global-phone, but it must generate multiple \"fax-mbox\" elements\n    \
    \ when passing the message to the MTA.\n"

- title: 5. Conclusion
  contents:
  - "5. Conclusion\n   This proposal creates a minimal standard encoding for FAX addresses\n\

- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   This document specifies a means by which FAX addresses\
    \ can be encoded\n   into e-mail addresses. As routing of e-mail messages is determined\
    \ by\n   Domain Name System (DNS) information, a successful attack on this\n \
    \  service could force the mail path via some particular gateway or\n   message\
    \ transfer agent where mail security can be affected by\n   compromised software.\n\
    \   There are several means by which an attacker might be able to deliver\n  \
    \ incorrect mail routing information to a client. These include: (a)\n   compromise\
    \ of a DNS server, (b) generating a counterfeit response to\n   a client's DNS\
    \ query, (c) returning incorrect \"additional\n   information\" in response to\
    \ an unrelated query. Clients SHOULD ensure\n   that mail routing is based only\
    \ on authoritative answers. Once DNS\n   Security mechanisms [5] become more widely\
    \ deployed, clients SHOULD\n   employ those mechanisms to verify the authenticity\
    \ and integrity of\n   mail routing records.\n   7. Author's Address\n   Claudio\
