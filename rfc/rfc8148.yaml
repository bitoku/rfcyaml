  - "Abstract\n   This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services\n
    \  mechanisms to support the next generation of emergency calls placed\n   by
    vehicles (automatically in the event of a crash or serious\n   incident, or manually
    invoked by a vehicle occupant) and conveying\n   vehicle, sensor, and location
    data related to the crash or incident.\n   Such calls are often referred to as
    \"Automatic Crash Notification\"\n   (ACN), or \"Advanced Automatic Crash Notification\"
    (AACN), even in the\n   case of manual trigger.  The \"Advanced\" qualifier refers
    to the\n   ability to carry a richer set of data.\n   This document also registers
    a MIME media type and Emergency Call\n   Data Type for the vehicle, sensor, and
    location data (often referred\n   to as \"crash data\" even though there is not
    necessarily a crash) and\n   an INFO package to enable carrying this and related
    data in SIP INFO\n   requests.  An external specification for the data format,
    contents,\n   and structure is referenced in this document.\n   This document
    reuses the technical aspects of next-generation Pan-\n   European eCall (a mandated
    and standardized system for emergency\n   calls by in-vehicle systems (IVSs) within
    Europe and other regions).\n   However, this document specifies use of a different
    set of vehicle\n   (crash) data, specifically, the Vehicle Emergency Data Set
    (VEDS)\n   rather than the eCall Minimum Set of Data (MSD).  This document is
    an\n   extension of the IETF eCall document, with the primary differences\n   being
    that this document makes the MSD data set optional and VEDS\n   mandatory, and
    it adds attribute values to the metadata/control\n   object to permit greater
    functionality.  This document registers a\n   new INFO package (identical to that
    registered for eCall but with the\n   addition of the VEDS MIME type).  This document
    also describes legacy\n   (circuit-switched) ACN systems and their migration to
    next-generation\n   emergency calling, to provide background information and context.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Emergency calls made by in-vehicle systems (e.g., automatically
    in\n   the event of a crash or serious incident or manually by a vehicle\n   occupant)
    assist in significantly reducing road deaths and injuries\n   by allowing emergency
    services to respond quickly and appropriately\n   to the specifics of the incident,
    often with better location\n   accuracy.\n   Drivers often have a poor location
    awareness, especially outside of\n   major cities, at night, and when away from
    home (especially abroad).\n   In the most crucial cases, the victim(s) might not
    be able to call\n   because they have been injured or trapped.\n   For more than
    two decades, some vehicles have been equipped with\n   telematics systems that,
    among other features, place an emergency\n   call automatically in the event of
    a crash or manually in response to\n   an emergency call button.  Such systems
    generally have on-board\n   location determination systems that make use of satellite-based\n
    \  positioning technology, inertial sensors, gyroscopes, etc., which can\n   provide
    an accurate position for the vehicle.  Such built-in systems\n   can take advantage
    of the benefits of being integrated into a\n   vehicle, such as more power capacity,
    ability to have larger or\n   specialized antenna, ability to be engineered to
    avoid or minimize\n   degradation by vehicle glass coatings, interference from
    other\n   vehicle systems, etc.  Thus, the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)\n
    \  can be provided with a good estimate of where the vehicle is during\n   an
    emergency.  Vehicle manufacturers are increasingly adopting such\n   systems,
    both for the safety benefits and for the additional features\n   and services
    they enable (e.g., remote engine diagnostics, remote\n   door unlock, stolen vehicle
    tracking and disabling, etc.).\n   A common term for such systems is Automatic
    Crash Notification (ACN)\n   or Advanced Automatic Crash Notification (AACN).
    \ Sometimes the word\n   \"Collision\" is used instead of \"Crash.\"  In this
    document, \"ACN\" is\n   used as a general term.  ACN systems transmit some amount
    of data\n   specific to the incident, referred to generally as \"crash data\"
    (the\n   term is commonly used even though there might not have been a crash).\n
    \  While different systems transmit different amounts of crash data,\n   standardized
    formats, structures, and mechanisms are needed to\n   provide interoperability
    among systems and PSAPs.\n   As of the date of this document, currently deployed
    in-vehicle\n   telematics systems are circuit-switched and lack a standards-based\n
    \  ability to convey crash data directly to the PSAP (generally relying\n   on
    either a human advisor or an automated text-to-speech system to\n   provide the
    PSAP call taker with some crash data orally, or in some\n   cases via a proprietary
    mechanism).  In most cases, the PSAP call\n   taker needs to first realize that
    the call is related to a vehicle\n   incident, and then listen to the data and
    transcribe it.  Circuit-\n   switched ACN systems are referred to here as \"CS-ACN\".\n
    \  The transition to next-generation emergency calling provides an\n   opportunity
    to vastly improve the scope, breadth, reliability, and\n   usefulness of crash
    data by transmitting a standardized set during\n   call setup; the data can be
    processed by the PSAP in an integrated,\n   automated way and made available to
    the call taker at call\n   presentation.  It also provides the ability for the
    call taker to\n   request that a vehicle take certain actions, such as flashing
    lights\n   or unlocking doors.  In addition, vehicle manufacturers are provided\n
    \  an opportunity to take advantage of the same standardized mechanisms\n   for
    data transmission and request processing for internal use if they\n   wish (such
    as telemetry between the vehicle and a service center for\n   both emergency and
    non-emergency uses, including location-based\n   services, multimedia entertainment
    systems, remote door unlocking,\n   remote diagnostics, and roadside assistance
    applications).\n   Next-generation ACN provides an opportunity for such calls
    to be\n   recognized and processed as such during call setup, and routed to an\n
    \  equipped PSAP where the vehicle data is available to assist the call\n   taker
    in assessing and responding to the situation.  Next-generation\n   (IP-based)
    ACN systems are referred to here as NG-ACN.\n   An ACN call can be initiated by
    a vehicle occupant or automatically\n   initiated by vehicle systems in the event
    of a serious incident.\n   (The \"A\" in \"ACN\" does stand for \"Automatic\",
    but the term is broadly\n   used to refer to the class of calls that are placed
    by an in-vehicle\n   system (IVS) or by Telematics Service Providers (TSPs) and
    that carry\n   incident-related data as well as voice.)  Automatically triggered\n
    \  calls indicate a car crash or some other serious incident (e.g., a\n   fire).
    \ Manually triggered calls include reports of observed crashes\n   or serious
    hazards (such as impaired drivers or roadway debris),\n   requests for medical
    assistance, etc.\n   The Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials
    (APCO) and\n   the National Emergency Number Association (NENA) have jointly\n
    \  developed a standardized set of incident-related vehicle data for ACN\n   use,
    called the Vehicle Emergency Data Set (VEDS) [VEDS].  Such data\n   is often referred
    to as crash data although it is applicable in\n   incidents other than crashes.\n
    \  This document describes how the IETF mechanisms for IP-based\n   emergency
    calls are used to provide the realization of next-\n   generation ACN.  Although
    this specification is designed with the\n   requirements for North America ACN
    in mind (and both APCO and NENA\n   are based in the U.S.), it is specified generically
    such that the\n   technology can be reused or extended to suit requirements in
    other\n   regions.\n   This document reuses the technical aspects of next-generation
    Pan-\n   European eCall (a mandated and standardized system for emergency\n   calls
    by in-vehicle systems within Europe), as described in\n   [RFC8147].  However,
    this document specifies use of a different set\n   of vehicle (crash) data, specifically,
    VEDS rather than the eCall\n   Minimum Set of Data (MSD).  This document is an
    extension of\n   [RFC8147], with the differences being that this document makes
    the\n   MSD data set optional and VEDS mandatory, and it adds new attribute\n
    \  values to the metadata/control object defined in that document.  This\n   document
    also registers a new INFO package (identical to that defined\n   in [RFC8147]
    with the addition of the VEDS MIME type).\n   This document registers the application/EmergencyCallData.VEDS+xml\n
    \  MIME media type, the VEDS Emergency Call Data Type, and the\n   EmergencyCallData.VEDS
    INFO package to enable carrying this and\n   related data in SIP INFO requests.\n
    \  Section 6 introduces VEDS.  Section 7 describes how VEDS data and\n   metadata/control
    blocks are transported within NG-ACN calls.\n   Section 8 describes how such calls
    are placed.\n   These mechanisms are used to place emergency calls that are\n
    \  identifiable as ACN calls and that carry standardized crash data in\n   an
    interoperable way.\n   Calls by in-vehicle systems are placed using cellular networks,
    which\n   might ignore location information sent by an originating device in an\n
    \  emergency call INVITE, instead substituting their own location\n   information
    (although often determined in cooperation with the\n   originating device).  Standardized
    crash data structures typically\n   include location as determined by the IVS.
    \ A benefit of this is that\n   it allows the PSAP to see both the location as
    determined by the\n   cellular network and the location as determined by the IVS.\n
    \  This specification inherits the ability to utilize test call\n   functionality
    from Section 15 of [RFC6881].\n"

  - "3.  Document Scope\n   This document is focused on how an ACN emergency call
    is set up and\n   incident-related data (including vehicle, sensor, and location
    data)\n   is transmitted to the PSAP using IETF specifications.  For the direct\n
    \  model, this is the end-to-end description (between the vehicle and\n   the
    PSAP).  For the TSP model, this describes the call leg between\n   the TSP and
    the PSAP, leaving the call leg between the vehicle and\n   the TSP up to the entities
    involved (i.e., IVS and TSP vendors) who\n   are free to use the same mechanism
    for both legs, or not.\n   Note that Europe has a mandated and standardized system
    for emergency\n   calls by in-vehicle systems.  This Pan-European system is known
    as\n   \"eCall\" and is the subject of a separate document, [RFC8147], which\n
    \  this document builds on.  Vehicles designed to operate in multiple\n   regions
    might need to support eCall as well as NG-ACN as described\n   here.  A vehicle
    IVS might determine whether to use eCall or ACN by\n   first determining the region
    or country in which it is located (e.g.,\n   from a GNSS location estimate and/or
    identity of or information from\n   an MNO).  If other regions adopt other data
    formats, a multi-region\n   vehicle might need to support those as well.  This
    document adopts\n   the call setup and other technical aspects of [RFC8147], which
    uses\n   [RFC7852]; this makes it straightforward to use a different data set\n
    \  while keeping other technical aspects unchanged.  Hence, both next-\n   generation
    eCall (NG-eCall) and the NG-ACN mechanism described here\n   are compatible, differing
    primarily in the specific data block that\n   is sent (the eCall MSD in the case
    of NG-eCall and VEDS in this\n   document) and some additions to the metadata/control
    data block.  If\n   other regions adopt their own vehicle data sets, this can
    be\n   similarly accommodated without changing other technical aspects.\n   Note
    that any additional data formats require a new INFO package to\n   permit transport
    within SIP INFO requests.\n"

  - "4.  Overview of Legacy Deployment Models\n   Legacy (circuit-switched) systems
    for placing emergency calls by\n   in-vehicle systems generally have some ability
    to convey at least\n   location and in some cases telematics data to the PSAP.
    \ Most such\n   systems use one of three architectural models, which are described\n
    \  here as: \"TSP\", \"direct\", and \"paired\".  These three models are\n   illustrated
    below.\n   In the TSP model, both emergency and routine TSP service calls are\n
    \  placed to a TSP; a proprietary technique (e.g., a proprietary in-band\n   modem)
    is used for data transfer between the TSP and the vehicle.\n   In an emergency,
    typically a TSP agent verifies the emergency,\n   bridges in the PSAP, and communicates
    location, crash data (such as\n   impact severity and trauma prediction), and
    other data (such as the\n   vehicle description) to the PSAP call taker orally
    (in some cases, a\n   proprietary out-of-band interface is used).  Since the TSP
    knows the\n   location of the vehicle (from on-board GNSS and sensors), location-\n
    \  based routing is usually used to route to the appropriate PSAP.  In\n   some
    cases, the TSP is able to transmit location automatically, using\n   similar techniques
    as for wireless calls.  A three-way voice call is\n   generally established between
    the vehicle, the TSP, and the PSAP,\n   allowing communication between the PSAP
    call taker, the TSP agent,\n   and the vehicle occupants (who might be unconscious).\n

    1: Legacy TSP Model\n   In the paired model, the IVS uses a local link (typically
    Bluetooth\n   [Bluetooth]) with a previously paired handset to establish an\n
    \  emergency call with the PSAP (by dialing a standard emergency number;\n   9-1-1
    in North America) and then communicates location data to the\n   PSAP via text-to-speech;
    crash data might or might not be conveyed\n   also using text-to-speech.  Some
    such systems use an automated voice\n   prompt menu for the PSAP call taker (e.g.,
    \"this is an automatic\n   emergency call from a vehicle; press 1 to open a voice
    path to the\n   vehicle; press 2 to hear the location read out\") to allow the

    text-to-speech; crash data might or might not be conveyed using\n   text-to-speech.

  - "5.  Migration to Next Generation\n   The migration of emergency calls placed
    by in-vehicle systems to\n   next-generation (all-IP) technology per this document
    provides a\n   standardized mechanism to identify such calls and to convey crash\n
    \  data with the call setup, as well as enabling additional\n   communications
    modalities and enhanced functionality.  This allows\n   ACN calls and crash data
    to be automatically processed by the PSAP\n   and made available to the call taker
    in an integrated, automated way.\n   Because the crash data is carried in the
    initial SIP INVITE (per\n   [RFC7852]) the PSAP can present it to the call taker
    simultaneously\n   with the appearance of the call.  The PSAP can also process
    the data\n   to take other actions (e.g., if multiple calls from the same location\n
    \  arrive when the PSAP is busy and a subset of them are NG-ACN calls, a\n   PSAP
    might choose to store the information and reject the calls,\n   since the IVS
    will receive confirmation that the information has been\n   successfully received;
    a PSAP could also choose to include a message\n   stating that it is aware of
    the incident and responders are on the\n   way, and a PSAP could call the vehicle
    back when a call taker is\n   available).\n   The migration of origination devices
    and networks, PSAPs, emergency\n   services networks, and other telephony environments
    to next\n   generation technology provides enhanced interoperability and\n   functionality,
    especially for emergency calls carrying additional\n   data such as vehicle crash
    data.  (In the U.S., a network\n   specifically for emergency responders is being
    developed.  This\n   network, FirstNet, will be next generation from the start,
    enhancing\n   the ability for data exchange between PSAPs and responders.)\n   NG-ACN
    calls can be recognized as such during call set-up; they can\n   be routed to
    a PSAP that is prepared both technically and\n   operationally to handle such
    calls, and the vehicle-determined\n   location and crash data can be processed
    automatically by the PSAP\n   and made available to the call taker simultaneously
    with the call\n   appearance.  Enhanced functionality includes the ability for
    the PSAP\n   call taker to request the vehicle to take an action, such as sending\n
    \  an updated set of data, conveying a message to the occupants,\n   flashing
    lights, unlocking doors, etc.\n   Vehicle manufacturers using the TSP model can
    choose to take\n   advantage of the same mechanism to carry telematics data and
    requests\n   and responses between the vehicle and the TSP for both emergency
    and\n   non-emergency calls as are used for the interface with the PSAP.\n   An
    IVS establishes a next-generation emergency call (see [RFC6443]\n   and [RFC6881])
    with an initial INVITE containing a Request-URI\n   indicating an ACN emergency
    call and Call-Info header fields\n   indicating that both vehicle crash and capabilities
    data are\n   included; the IVS typically does not perform routing or location\n
    \  queries (relying on the MNO for this).\n   [RFC8147] registers new service
    URN children within the \"sos\"\n   subservice.  These URNs request NG-ACN resources
    and differentiate\n   between manually and automatically triggered NG-ACN calls
    (which\n   might be subject to different treatment depending on policy).  The\n
    \  two service URNs registered in [RFC8147] are\n   \"urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic\"
    and \"urn:service:sos.ecall.manual\".\n   The same service URNs are used for ACN
    as for eCall since in any\n   region only one of these is supported, making a
    distinction\n   unnecessary.  (Further, PSAP equipment might support multiple
    data\n   formats, allowing a PSAP to handle a vehicle that erroneously sent\n
    \  the wrong data object.)\n   Note that in North America, routing queries performed
    by clients\n   outside of an ESInet typically treat all sub-services of \"sos\"\n
    \  identically to \"sos\" with no sub-service.  However, the Request-URI\n   header
    field retains the full sub-service; route and handling\n   decisions within an
    ESInet or PSAP can take the sub-service into\n   account.  For example, in a region
    with multiple cooperating PSAPs,\n   an NG-ACN call might be routed to a PSAP
    that is NG-ACN capable, or\n   one that specializes in vehicle-related incidents.\n
    \  Migration of the three architectural models to next generation\n   (all-IP)
    is described below.\n   In the TSP model, the IVS transmits crash and location
    data to the\n   TSP either by reusing the mechanisms and data objects described
    in\n   this document or by using a proprietary mechanism.  In an emergency,\n
    \  the TSP bridges in the PSAP, and the TSP transmits crash and other\n   data
    to the PSAP using the mechanisms and data objects described in\n   this document.
    \ There is a three-way call between the vehicle, the\n   TSP, and the PSAP, allowing
    communication between the PSAP call\n   taker, the TSP agent, and the vehicle
    occupants (who might be\n   unconscious).  The TSP relays PSAP requests and vehicle
    responses.\n                   proprietary\n     ///----\\\\\\    or standard

    that the TSP model can be more difficult when the\n   vehicle is in a different
    country than the TSP (e.g., a US resident\n   driving in Canada) because of the
    additional complexity in choosing\n   the correct PSAP based on vehicle location
    performed by a TSP in a\n   different country.)\n   In the direct model, the IVS
    communicates crash data to the PSAP\n   directly using the mechanisms and data
    objects described in this\n   document.\n     ///----\\\\\\           NG emergency

    for transmitting crash data\n   through the link to the handset for inclusion
    in an NG emergency call\n   and receiving additional data items from the response.
    \ Hence,\n   manufacturers that use the paired model for legacy calls might choose\n

    Model\n   Regardless of model, if the call is routed to a PSAP that is not\n   NG-ACN
    capable, the PSAP ignores (or does not receive) the vehicle\n   data.  This is
    detectable by the IVS or TSP when the status response\n   to the INVITE (e.g.,
    200 OK) lacks a metadata/control structure\n   acknowledging receipt of the data
    [RFC8147].  The IVS or TSP then\n   proceeds as it would for a CS-ACN call (e.g.,
    oral conveyance of\n   data).\n"

  - "6.  Vehicle Data\n   APCO and NENA have jointly developed a standardized set
    of incident-\n   related vehicle data for ACN use, called the Vehicle Emergency
    Data\n   Set (VEDS) [VEDS].  Such data is often referred to as crash data\n   although
    it is applicable in incidents other than crashes.\n   VEDS provides a standard
    data set for the transmission, exchange, and\n   interpretation of vehicle-related
    data.  A standard data format\n   allows the data to be generated by an IVS or
    TSP and interpreted by\n   PSAPs, emergency responders, and medical facilities.
    \ It includes\n   incident-related information such as airbag deployment, location
    and\n   compass orientation of the vehicle, spatial orientation of the\n   vehicle
    (e.g., upright, on a side, roof, or bumper), sensor data that\n   can indicate
    the potential severity of the crash and the likelihood\n   of severe injuries
    to the vehicle occupants, etc.  This data better\n   informs the PSAP and emergency
    responders as to the type of response\n   that might be needed.  Some of this
    information has been included in\n   U.S. government guidelines for field triage
    of injured patients\n   [triage-2008] [triage-2011].  These guidelines are designed
    to help\n   responders identify the potential existence of severe internal\n   injuries
    and to make critical decisions about how and where a patient\n   needs to be transported.\n
    \  VEDS is an XML structure (see [VEDS]) transported in SIP using the\n   application/EmergencyCallData.VEDS+xml
    MIME media type.\n   If new data blocks are needed (e.g., in other regions or
    for enhanced\n   data), the steps required during standardization are briefly\n
    \  summarized below:\n   o  A set of data is standardized by a Standards Development\n
    \     Organization (SDO) or appropriate organization.\n   o  A MIME media type
    for the crash data set is registered with IANA\n      *  If the data is specifically
    for use in emergency calling, the\n         MIME media type is normally under
    the application type with a\n         subtype starting with EmergencyCallData.\n
    \     *  If the data format is XML, then by convention the name has a\n         suffix
    of \"+xml\".\n   o  The item is registered in the \"Emergency Call Data Types\"\n
    \     registry, as defined in Section 11.1.9 of [RFC7852].\n      *  For emergency-call-specific
    formats, the registered name is the\n         root of the MIME media type (not
    including the\n         EmergencyCallData prefix and any suffix such as \"+xml\")
    as\n         described in Section 4.1 of [RFC7852].\n   o  A new INFO package
    is registered that permits carrying the new\n      media type, the metadata/control
    object (defined in [RFC8147]),\n      and for compatibility, the MSD and VEDS
    objects, in SIP INFO\n      requests.\n"

  - "7.  Data Transport\n   [RFC7852] establishes a general mechanism for including
    blocks of\n   data within a SIP emergency call.  This document makes use of that\n
    \  mechanism.  This document also registers an INFO package (in\n   Section 14.7)
    to enable NG-ACN-related data blocks to be carried in\n   SIP INFO requests (per
    [RFC6086], new SIP INFO method usages require\n   the definition of an INFO package).\n
    \  VEDS is an XML structure defined by APCO and NENA [VEDS].  It is\n   carried
    in a body part with MIME media type application/\n   EmergencyCallData.VEDS+xml.\n
    \  An IVS transmits a VEDS data block (see [VEDS]) by including it as a\n   body
    part of a SIP message per [RFC7852].  The body part is\n   identified by its MIME
    media type (application/\n   EmergencyCallData.VEDS+xml) in the Content-Type header
    field of the\n   body part.  The body part is assigned a unique identifier that
    is\n   listed in a Content-ID header field in the body part.  The SIP\n   message
    is marked as containing the VEDS data by adding (or appending\n   to) a Call-Info
    header field at the top level of the SIP message.\n   This Call-Info header field
    contains a Content Identifier (CID) URL\n   referencing the body part's unique
    identifier and a \"purpose\"\n   parameter identifying the data as a VEDS data
    block per the\n   \"Emergency Call Data Types\" registry entry; the \"purpose\"
    parameter's\n   value is \"EmergencyCallData.VEDS\".  A VEDS data block is carried
    in a\n   SIP INFO request by using the INFO package defined in Section 14.7.\n
    \  A PSAP or IVS transmits a metadata/control object (see [RFC8147]) by\n   including
    it in a SIP message as a MIME body part per [RFC7852].  The\n   body part is identified
    by its MIME media type (application/\n   EmergencyCallData.Control+xml) in the
    Content-Type header field of\n   the body part.  The body part is assigned a unique
    identifier that is\n   listed in a Content-ID header field in the body part.  The
    SIP\n   message is marked as containing the metadata/control block by adding\n
    \  (or appending to) a Call-Info header field at the top level of the\n   SIP
    message.  This Call-Info header field contains a CID URL\n   referencing the body
    part's unique identifier and a \"purpose\"\n   parameter identifying the data
    as a metadata/control block per the\n   \"Emergency Call Data Types\" registry
    entry; the \"purpose\" parameter's\n   value is \"EmergencyCallData.Control\".
    \ A metadata/control object is\n   carried in a SIP INFO request by using the
    INFO package defined in\n   Section 14.7.\n   A body part containing a VEDS or
    metadata/control object has a\n   Content-Disposition header field value containing
    \"By-Reference\" and\n   is always enclosed in a multipart body part (even if
    it would\n   otherwise be the only body part in the SIP message).\n   An IVS initiating
    an NG-ACN call includes in the initial INVITE a\n   VEDS data block and a metadata/control
    object informing the PSAP of\n   its capabilities.  The VEDS and metadata/control
    body parts (and\n   Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO))
    have a\n   Content-Disposition header field with the value \"By-Reference;\n   handling=optional\".
    \ Specifying handling=optional prevents the INVITE\n   from being rejected if
    it is processed by a legacy element (e.g., a\n   gateway between SIP and circuit-switched
    environments) that does not\n   understand the VEDS or metadata/control (or PIDF-LO)
    objects.  The\n   PSAP creates a metadata/control object acknowledging receipt
    of the\n   VEDS data and includes it in the SIP final response to the INVITE.\n
    \  The metadata/control object is not included in provisional (e.g.,\n   180)
    responses.\n   If the IVS receives an acknowledgment for a VEDS data object with\n
    \  received=false, this indicates that the PSAP was unable to properly\n   decode
    or process the VEDS.  The IVS action is not defined (e.g., it\n   might only log
    an error).  Since the PSAP is able to request an\n   updated VEDS during the call,
    if an initial VEDS is unsatisfactory in\n   any way, the PSAP can choose to request
    another one.\n   A PSAP can request that the vehicle send an updated VEDS data
    block\n   during a call.  To do so, the PSAP creates a metadata/control object\n
    \  requesting VEDS data and includes it as a body part of a SIP INFO\n   request
    sent within the dialog.  The IVS then includes an updated\n   VEDS data object
    as a body part of a SIP INFO request and sends it\n   within the dialog.  If the
    IVS is unable to send the VEDS for any\n   reason, it instead sends a metadata/control
    object containing an\n   <ack> element acknowledging the request and containing
    an\n   <actionResult> element with the \"success\" parameter set to \"false\"\n
    \  and a \"reason\" parameter (and optionally a \"details\" parameter)\n   indicating
    why the request cannot be accomplished.  Per [RFC6086],\n   metadata/control objects
    and VEDS data are sent using the INFO\n   package defined in Section 14.7.  In
    addition, to align with the way\n   a VEDS or metadata/control block is transmitted
    in a SIP message\n   other than a SIP INFO request, one or more Call-Info header
    fields\n   are included in the SIP INFO request referencing the VEDS or\n   metadata/control
    block.  See Section 14.7 for more information on the\n   use of SIP INFO requests
    within NG-ACN calls.\n   Any metadata/control object sent by a PSAP can request
    that the\n   vehicle perform an action (such as sending a data block, flashing\n
    \  lights, providing a camera feed, etc.).  The IVS sends an\n   acknowledgment
    for any request other than a successfully executed\n   send-data action.  Multiple
    requests with the same \"action:\" value\n   MUST be sent in separate metadata/control
    body parts (to avoid any\n   ambiguity in the acknowledgment).  For each metadata/control
    block\n   received containing one or more <request> elements (except for\n   successfully
    executed send-data requests), the IVS sends a metadata/\n   control object containing
    an <ack> element acknowledging the received\n   metadata/control block, containing
    an <actionResult> element per\n   <request> element.\n   If the IVS is aware that
    VEDS data it sent previously has changed, it\n   MAY send an unsolicited VEDS
    in any convenient SIP message, including\n   a SIP INFO request during the call.
    \ The PSAP sends an acknowledgment\n   for an unsolicited VEDS object; if the
    IVS sent the unsolicited VEDS\n   in a SIP INFO request, the acknowledgment is
    sent in a new SIP INFO\n   request; otherwise, it is sent in the reply to the
    SIP request\n   containing the VEDS.\n"

    using one\n   of the SOS sub-services \"SOS.ecall.automatic\" or \"SOS.ecall.manual\"\n
    \  in the Request-URI.  This SIP INVITE request includes standard sets\n   of
    both crash and capabilities data as described in Section 7.\n   Entities along
    the path between the vehicle and the PSAP are able to\n   identify the call as
    an ACN call and handle it appropriately.  The\n   PSAP is able to identify the
    crash and capabilities data included in\n   the SIP INVITE request by examining
    the Call-Info header fields for\n   \"purpose\" parameters whose values start
    with EmergencyCallData.  The\n   PSAP is able to access the data it is capable

      \ A\n      registry is created in Section 14.4 for messages and their IDs.\n

  - "10.  Test Calls\n   An NG-ACN test call is a call that is recognized and treated
    to some\n   extent as an NG-ACN call but is not given emergency call treatment\n
    \  nor handled by a PSAP call taker.  The specific handling of test\n   NG-ACN
    calls is outside the scope of this document; typically, the\n   test call facility
    allows the IVS, user, or TSP to verify that an\n   NG-ACN call can be successfully
    established with voice and/or other\n   media communication.  The IVS might also
    be able to verify that the\n   crash data was successfully received.\n   This
    document builds on [RFC8147], which inherits the ability to\n   utilize test call
    functionality from Section 15 of [RFC6881].  A\n   service URN starting with \"test.\"
    indicates a test call.  Per\n   [RFC8147], \"urn:service:test.sos.ecall\" is used
    for test NG-ACN\n   calls.\n   MNOs, emergency authorities, ESInets, and PSAPs
    handle a vehicle call\n   requesting the \"test\" service URN so that the desired
    functionality\n   is tested, but this is outside the scope of this document.  (One\n
    \  possibility is that MNOs route such calls as non-emergency calls to\n   an
    ESInet, which routes them to a PSAP that supports NG-ACN calls;\n   the PSAP accepts
    test calls, sends a crash data acknowledgment, and\n   plays an audio clip (for
    example, saying that the call reached an\n   appropriate PSAP and the vehicle
    data was successfully processed) in\n   addition to supporting media loopback
    per [RFC6881].)\n   Note that since test calls are placed using \"test\" as the
    parent\n   service URN and \"sos\" as a child, such calls are not treated as an\n
    \  emergency call, so some functionality might not apply (such as\n   preemption
    or availability for devices lacking service\n   (\"non-service-initialized\" (NSI)
    devices) if those are available for\n   emergency calls).\n"

  - "11.  Example Call Initiation\n   Figure 10 shows an NG-ACN call initiation.  The
    vehicle initiates an\n   NG-ACN call using an MNO.  The MNO routes the call to
    an ESInet, as\n   for any emergency call.  The ESInet routes the call to an appropriate\n
    \  NG-ACN-capable PSAP (using location information and the fact that it\n   is
    an NG-ACN call).  The call is processed by the Emergency Services\n   Routing
    Proxy (ESRP), as the entry point to the ESInet.  The ESRP\n   routes the call
    to an appropriate NG-ACN-capable PSAP, where the call\n   is handled by a call
    taker.  (In deployments where there is no\n   ESInet, the MNO itself routes the
    call directly to an appropriate\n   NG-ACN-capable PSAP.)\n                               +---------------------------------------+\n

    \                   Figure 10: Example Call Initiation\n   Figure 11 illustrates
    an example SIP emergency call INVITE request as\n   generated by the IVS.  It
    includes a PIDF-LO with vehicle-determined\n   location information, a VEDS block
    with crash data, and a metadata/\n   control block with capabilities data.  The
    INVITE has a request URI\n   containing the urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic service
    URN.  For\n   brevity, the example VEDS block does not show VEDS location\n   information,
    although this is generally present.\n   The example VEDS data structure shows
    information about a crashed\n   vehicle.  The example communicates that the car
    is a model year 2015\n   Saab 9-5 (a car that does not exist).  The front airbag
    deployed as a\n   consequence of the crash.  The <VehicleBodyCategoryCode> indicates\n
    \  that the crashed vehicle is a passenger car (the code is set to\n   \"101\")
    and that it is not a convertible (the <ConvertibleIndicator>\n   value is set
    to \"false\").\n   The <VehicleCrashPulse> element provides further information
    about\n   the crash, namely that the force of impact based on the change in\n
    \  velocity over the duration of the crash pulse was 100 MPH.  The\n   principal
    direction of the force of the impact is set to \"12\" (which\n   refers to 12
    o'clock, corresponding to a frontal collision).  This\n   value is in the <CrashPulsePrincipalDirectionOfForceValue>
    element.\n   The <CrashPulseRolloverQuarterTurnsValue> indicates the number of\n
    \  quarter turns in concert with a rollover expressed as a number; in\n   our
    case 1.\n   No roll bar was deployed, as indicated in\n   <VehicleRollbarDeployedIndicator>
    being set to \"false\".\n   Next, there is information indicating seat belt and
    seat sensor data\n   for individual seat positions in the vehicle.  In our example,\n
    \  information from the driver seat is available (value \"1\" in the\n   <VehicleSeatLocationCategoryCode>
    element) showing that the seat belt\n   was monitored (<VehicleSeatbeltMonitoredIndicator>
    element), the seat\n   belt was fastened (<VehicleSeatbeltFastenedIndicator> element),
    and\n   the seat sensor determined that the seat was occupied\n   (<VehicleSeatOccupiedIndicator>
    element).\n   The weight of the vehicle when empty is listed as 600 kilograms
    in\n   our example.\n   The <SevereInjuryIndicator> element is set to \"true\",
    indicating a\n   likelihood that a vehicle occupant has suffered a severe injury\n
    \  requiring immediate trauma care.\n   Additional information is provided, including
    the presence of fuel\n   leakage (<FuelLeakingIndicator> element), an indication
    whether the\n   vehicle was subjected to multiple impacts (<MultipleImpactsIndicator>\n
    \  element), the orientation of the vehicle at final rest\n   (<VehicleFinalRestOrientationCategoryCode>
    element), and an\n   indication that no parts of the vehicle are currently detected

  - "12.  Security Considerations\n   Since this document relies on [RFC8147] and
    [RFC7852], the security\n   considerations described in those specifications apply
    here.  The\n   security considerations of [RFC5069] apply as well.  Implementors
    are\n   cautioned to read and understand the discussion in those documents.\n
    \  In emergency service systems where location data is supplied or\n   determined
    with the assistance of an end host, it is possible that\n   the location is incorrect,
    either intentionally (e.g., in a denial-\n   of-service attack against the emergency
    services infrastructure) or\n   due to a malfunctioning device.  The reader is
    referred to [RFC7378]\n   for a discussion of some of these vulnerabilities.\n
    \  In addition to the security considerations discussion specific to the\n   metadata/control
    object in [RFC8147], note that vehicles MAY decline\n   to carry out any requested
    action (e.g., if the vehicle requires but\n   is unable to verify the certificate
    used to sign the request).  The\n   vehicle MAY use any value in the reason registry
    to indicate why it\n   did not take an action (e.g., the generic \"unable\" or
    the more\n   specific \"security-failure\").  Because some actions carry more\n
    \  potential risk than others (e.g., unlocking a door versus flashing\n   lights),
    vehicle policy MAY decline to carry out some requests in\n   some circumstances
    (e.g., decline a request to unlock doors, send an\n   updated VEDS, or enable
    a camera received in a vehicle-terminated\n   call while carrying out such requests
    received in a vehicle-initiated\n   emergency call).\n"

  - "13.  Privacy Considerations\n   Since this document builds on [RFC8147], which
    itself builds on\n   [RFC7852], the data structures specified there, and the corresponding\n
    \  privacy considerations discussed there, apply here as well.  The VEDS\n   data
    structure contains optional elements that can carry identifying\n   and personal
    information, both about the vehicle and about the owner,\n   as well as location
    information, so it needs to be protected against\n   unauthorized disclosure,
    as discussed in [RFC7852].  Local\n   regulations may impose additional privacy
    protection requirements.\n   The additional functionality enabled by this document,
    such as access\n   to vehicle camera streams, carries a burden of protection,
    so\n   implementations need to be careful that access is only provided\n   within
    the context of an emergency call or to an emergency services\n   provider (e.g.,
    by verifying that the request for camera access is\n   signed by a certificate
    issued by an emergency services registrar).\n"

      title: 14.7.1.  Overall Description
    - contents:
      - "14.7.2.  Applicability\n   This section describes why the INFO package mechanism,
        rather than\n   some other mechanism, has been chosen for the specific use
        case.\n   The use of the SIP INFO method is based on an analysis of the\n
        \  requirements against the intent and effects of the INFO method versus\n
        \  other approaches (which included the SIP MESSAGE method, SIP OPTIONS\n
        \  method, SIP re-INVITE method, media-plane transport, and non-SIP\n   protocols).
        \ In particular, the transport of emergency call data\n   blocks occurs within
        a SIP emergency dialog, per Section 7, and is\n   normally carried in the
        initial INVITE request and its response; the\n   use of the INFO method only
        occurs when emergency-call-related data\n   needs to be sent mid call.  While
        the SIP MESSAGE method could be\n   used, it is not tied to a SIP dialog as
        is the INFO method and thus\n   might not be associated with the dialog.  Both
        the SIP OPTIONS or\n   re-INVITE methods could also be used, but they are
        seen as less clean\n   than the INFO method.  The SIP SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY method
        could be\n   coerced into service, but the semantics are not a good fit, e.g.,
        the\n   subscribe/notify mechanism provides one-way communication consisting\n
        \  of (often multiple) notifications from notifier to subscriber\n   indicating
        that certain events in the notifier have occurred, whereas\n   what's needed
        here is two-way communication of data related to the\n   emergency dialog.
        \ Use of media-plane mechanisms was discounted\n   because the number of messages
        needing to be exchanged in a dialog is\n   normally zero or very few, and
        the size of the data is likewise very\n   small.  The overhead caused by user-plane
        setup (e.g., to use the\n   Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) as transport)
        would be\n   disproportionately large.\n   Based on the analyses, the SIP
        INFO method was chosen to provide for\n   mid-call data transport.\n"

        INFO package is a multipart\n   body containing zero or one application/EmergencyCallData.VEDS+xml\n
        \  parts (containing a VEDS data block), zero or more application/\n   EmergencyCallData.Control+xml
        (containing a metadata/control object)\n   parts, and zero or one application/EmergencyCallData.eCall.MSD
        parts\n   (containing an MSD).  At least one VEDS, MSD, or metadata/control\n
        \  body part is expected; the behavior upon receiving a SIP INFO request\n
        \  with none is undefined.\n   The body parts are sent per [RFC6086]; in addition,
        to align with how\n   these body parts are sent in non-INFO messages, each
        associated body\n   part is referenced by a Call-Info header field at the
        top level of\n   the SIP message.  The body part has a Content-Disposition
        header\n   field set to \"By-Reference\".\n   A VEDS, metadata/control block,
        or MSD is always enclosed in a\n   multipart body part (even if it would otherwise
        be the only body part\n   in the SIP message).  The outermost multipart that
        contains only body\n   parts associated with the INFO package has a Content-Disposition\n
        \  value of \"Info-Package\".\n   Service providers in the call path are not
        expected to add Additional\n   Data [RFC7852] to SIP INFO requests (as they
        would to an initial\n   INVITE request).\n"

        established emergency call\n   dialog to send requests, updated data, or an
        acknowledgment.  Because\n   requests are normally sent only on manual action
        of the PSAP call\n   taker (who suspects some aspect of the vehicle state
        has changed) and\n   updated data is sent only when an aspect of previously
        sent data has\n   changed, the rate of SIP INFO requests associated with the\n
        \  EmergencyCallData.VEDS INFO package is normally quite low (most\n   dialogs
        are likely to contain zero SIP INFO requests, while others\n   can be expected
        to carry an occasional request).\n"
