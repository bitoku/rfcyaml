  - "1.  Introduction\n   Network elements such as firewalls are an integral aspect\
    \ of a\n   majority of IP networks today, given the state of security in the\n\
    \   Internet, threats, and vulnerabilities to data networks.  Current IP\n   networks\
    \ are predominantly based on IPv4 technology, and hence\n   firewalls have been\
    \ designed for these networks.  Deployment of IPv6\n   networks is currently progressing,\
    \ albeit at a slower pace.\n   Firewalls for IPv6 networks are still maturing\
    \ and in development.\n   Mobility support for IPv6 has been standardized as specified\
    \ in RFC\n   3775.  Given the fact that Mobile IPv6 is a recent standard, most\n\
    \   firewalls available for IPv6 networks do not support Mobile IPv6.\n   Unless\
    \ firewalls are aware of Mobile IPv6 protocol details, these\n   security devices\
    \ will interfere with the smooth operation of the\n   protocol and can be a detriment\
    \ to deployment.\n   Mobile IPv6 enables IP mobility for IPv6 nodes.  It allows\
    \ a mobile\n   IPv6 node to be reachable via its home IPv6 address irrespective\
    \ of\n   any link that the mobile attaches to.  This is possible as a result\n\
    \   of the extensions to IPv6 defined in the Mobile IPv6 specification\n   [1].\n\
    \   Mobile IPv6 protocol design also incorporates a feature termed Route\n   Optimization.\
    \  This set of extensions is a fundamental part of the\n   protocol that enables\
    \ optimized routing of packets between a mobile\n   node and its correspondent\
    \ node and therefore optimized performance\n   of the communication.\n   In most\
    \ cases, current firewall technologies, however, do not support\n   Mobile IPv6\
    \ or are not even aware of Mobile IPv6 headers and\n   extensions.  Since most\
    \ networks in the current business environment\n   deploy firewalls, this may\
    \ prevent future large-scale deployment of\n   the Mobile IPv6 protocol.\n   This\
    \ document presents in detail some of the issues that firewalls\n   present for\
    \ Mobile IPv6 deployment, as well as the impact of each\n   issue.\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   Return Routability Test (RRT): The Return Routability Test\
    \ is a\n      procedure defined in RFC 3775 [1].  It is performed prior to the\n\
    \      Route Optimization (RO), where a mobile node (MN) instructs a\n      correspondent\
    \ node (CN) to direct the mobile node's data traffic\n      to its claimed care-of\
    \ address (CoA).  The Return Routability\n      procedure provides some security\
    \ assurance and prevents the misuse\n      of Mobile IPv6 signaling to maliciously\
    \ redirect the traffic or to\n      launch other attacks.\n"

- title: 4.  Overview of Firewalls
  contents:
  - "4.  Overview of Firewalls\n   The following section provides a brief overview\
    \ of firewalls.  It is\n   intended as background information so that issues with\
    \ the Mobile\n   IPv6 protocol can then be presented in detail in the following\n\
    \   sections.\n   There are different types of firewalls, and state can be created\
    \ in\n   these firewalls through different methods.  Independent of the\n   adopted\
    \ method, firewalls typically look at five parameters of the\n   traffic arriving\
    \ at the firewalls:\n   o  Source IP address\n   o  Destination IP address\n \
    \  o  Protocol type\n   o  Source port number\n   o  Destination port number\n\
    \   Based on these parameters, firewalls usually decide whether to allow\n   the\
    \ traffic or to drop the packets.  Some firewalls may filter only\n   incoming\
    \ traffic, while others may also filter outgoing traffic.\n   According to Section\
    \ 3.29 of RFC 2647 [2], stateful packet filtering\n   refers to the process of\
    \ forwarding or rejecting traffic based on the\n   contents of a state table maintained\
    \ by a firewall.  These types of\n   firewalls are commonly deployed to protect\
    \ networks from different\n   threats, such as blocking unsolicited incoming traffic\
    \ from the\n   external networks.  The following briefly describes how these\n\
    \   firewalls work since they can create additional problems with the\n   Mobile\
    \ IPv6 protocol as described in the subsequent sections.\n   In TCP, an MN sends\
    \ a TCP SYN message to connect to another host in\n   the Internet.\n   Upon receiving\
    \ that SYN packet, the firewall records the source IP\n   address, the destination\
    \ IP address, the Protocol type, the source\n   port number, and the destination\
    \ port number indicated in that packet\n   before transmitting it to the destination.\n\
    \   When an incoming message from the external networks reaches the\n   firewall,\
    \ it searches the packet's source IP address, destination IP\n   address, Protocol\
    \ type, source port number, and destination port\n   number in its entries to\
    \ see if the packet matches the\n   characteristics of a request sent previously.\
    \  If so, the firewall\n   allows the packet to enter the network.  If the packet\
    \ was not\n   solicited from an internal node, the packet is blocked.\n   When\
    \ the TCP close session packets are exchanged or after some\n   configurable period\
    \ of inactivity, the associated entry in the\n   firewall is deleted.  This mechanism\
    \ prevents entries from remaining\n   when TCP are abruptly terminated.\n   A\
    \ similar entry is created when using UDP.  The difference with this\n   transport\
    \ protocol is that UDP is connectionless and does not have\n   packets signaling\
    \ the initiation or termination of a session.\n   Consequently, the duration of\
    \ the entries relies solely on timers.\n"

  - "5.  Analysis of Various Scenarios Involving MIP6 Nodes and Firewalls\n   The\
    \ following section describes various scenarios involving MIP6\n   nodes and firewalls\
    \ and also presents the issues related to each\n   scenario.\n   The Mobile IPv6\
    \ specifications define three main entities: the mobile\n   node (MN), the correspondent\
    \ node (CN), and the home agent (HA).\n   Each of these entities may be in a network\
    \ protected by one or many\n   firewalls:\n   o  Section 5.1 analyzes the issues\
    \ when the MN is in a network\n      protected by firewall(s)\n   o  Section 5.2\
    \ analyzes the issues when the CN is in a network\n      protected by firewall(s)\n\
    \   o  Section 5.3 analyzes the issues when the HA is in a network\n      protected\
    \ by firewall(s)\n   The MN may also be moving from an external network, to a\
    \ network\n   protected by firewall(s).  The issues of this case are described\
    \ in\n   Section 5.4.\n   Some of the described issues (e.g., Sections 5.1 and\
    \ 5.2) may require\n   modifications to the protocols or to the firewalls, and\
    \ others (e.g.,\n   Section 5.3) may require only that appropriate rules and\n\

    \   Network protected\n   Figure 1: Issues between MIP6 and firewalls when MN\
    \ is in a network\n             protected by firewalls\n   A number of issues\
    \ need to be considered:\n   Issue 1: When MN A connects to the network, it should\
    \ acquire a local\n      IP address (CoA) and send a Binding Update (BU) to its\
    \ Home Agent\n      to update the HA with its current point of attachment.  The\n\
    \      Binding Updates and Acknowledgements should be protected by IPsec\n   \
    \   ESP according to the MIPv6 specifications [1].  However, as a\n      default\
    \ rule, many firewalls drop IPsec ESP packets because they\n      cannot determine\
    \ whether inbound ESP packets are legitimate.  It\n      is difficult or impossible\
    \ to create useful state by observing the\n      outbound ESP packets.  This may\
    \ cause the Binding Updates and\n      Acknowledgements between the mobile nodes\
    \ and their home agent to\n      be dropped.\n   Issue 2: Let's now consider a\
    \ node in the external network, B, trying\n      to establish a communication\
    \ with MN A.\n      *  B sends a packet to the mobile node's home address.\n \
    \     *  The packet is intercepted by the MN's home agent, which tunnels\n   \
    \      it to the MN's CoA [1].\n      *  When arriving at the firewall(s) protecting\
    \ MN A, the packet\n         may be dropped since the incoming packet may not\
    \ match any\n         existing state.  As described in Section 4, stateful inspection\n\
    \         packet filters (for example) typically drop unsolicited\n         incoming\
    \ traffic.\n      *  B will thus not be able to contact MN A and establish a\n\
    \         communication.\n      Even though the HA is updated with the location\
    \ of an MN,\n      firewalls may prevent correspondent nodes from establishing\n\
    \      communications when the MN is in a network protected by\n      firewall(s).\n\
    \   Issue 3: Let's assume a communication between MN A and an external\n     \
    \ node B.  MN A may want to use Route Optimization (RO) so that\n      packets\
    \ can be directly exchanged between the MN and the CN\n      without passing through\
    \ the HA.  However, the firewalls protecting\n      the MN might present issues\
    \ with the Return Routability procedure\n      that needs to be performed prior\
    \ to using RO.\n      According to the MIPv6 specifications, the Home Test message\
    \ of\n      the RRT must be protected by IPsec in tunnel mode.  However,\n   \
    \   firewalls might drop any packet protected by ESP, since the\n      firewalls\
    \ cannot analyze the packets encrypted by ESP (e.g., port\n      numbers).  The\
    \ firewalls may thus drop the Home Test messages and\n      prevent the completion\
    \ of the RRT procedure.\n   Issue 4: Let's assume that MN A successfully sends\
    \ a Binding Update\n      to its home agent (resp. correspondent nodes) -- which\
    \ solves\n      issue 1 (resp. issue 3) -- and that the subsequent traffic is\
    \ sent\n      from the HA (resp. CN) to the MN's CoA.  However there may not be\n\
    \      any corresponding state in the firewalls.  The firewalls\n      protecting\
    \ A may thus drop the incoming packets.\n      The appropriate states for the\
    \ traffic to the MN's CoA need to be\n      created in the firewall(s).\n   Issue\
    \ 5: When MN A moves, it may move to a link that is served by a\n      different\
    \ firewall.  MN A might be sending a BU to its CN;\n      however, incoming packets\
    \ may be dropped at the firewall, since\n      the firewall on the new link that\
    \ the MN attaches to does not have\n      any state that is associated with the\
    \ MN.\n   The issues described above result from the fact that the MN is behind\n\
    \   the firewall.  Consequently, the MN's communication capability with\n   other\
    \ nodes is affected by the firewall rules.\n"

    \   Network protected                  Node\n       by a firewall\n   Figure 2:\
    \ Issues between MIP6 and firewalls when a CN is in a network\n             protected\
    \ by firewalls\n   The following issues need to be considered:\n   Issue 1: The\
    \ MN (MN B) should use its Home Address (HoA B) when\n      establishing the communication\
    \ with the CN (CN C), if MN B wants\n      to take advantage of the mobility support\
    \ provided by the Mobile\n      IPv6 protocol for its communication with CN C.\
    \  The state created\n      by the firewall protecting CN C is therefore created\
    \ based on the\n      IP address of C (IP C) and the home address of Node B (IP\
    \ HoA B).\n      The states may be created via different means, and the protocol\n\
    \      type as well as the port numbers depend on the connection setup.\n    \
    \     Uplink packet filters (1)\n            Source IP address: IP C\n       \
    \     Destination IP address: HoA B\n            Protocol Type: TCP/UDP\n    \
    \        Source Port Number: #1\n            Destination Port Number: #2\n   \
    \      Downlink packet filters (2)\n            Source IP address: HoA B\n   \
    \         Destination IP address: IP C\n            Protocol Type: TCP/UDP\n \
    \           Source Port Number: #2\n            Destination Port Number: #1\n\
    \      Nodes C and B might be topologically close to each other, while\n     \
    \ B's home agent may be far away, resulting in a trombone effect\n      that can\
    \ create delay and degrade the performance.  MN B may\n      decide to initiate\
    \ the route optimization procedure with Node C.\n      Route optimization requires\
    \ MN B to send a Binding Update to Node\n      C in order to create an entry in\
    \ its binding cache that maps the\n      MN's home address to its current care-of-address.\
    \  However, prior\n      to sending the binding update, the mobile node must first\
    \ execute\n      a Return Routability Test:\n      *  Mobile Node B has to send\
    \ a Home Test Init (HoTI) message via\n         its home agent and\n      *  a\
    \ Care of Test Init (COTI) message directly to its\n         Correspondent Node\
    \ C.\n      The Care of Test Init message is sent using the CoA of B as the\n\
    \      source address.  Such a packet does not match any entry in the\n      protecting\
    \ firewall (2).  The CoTi message will thus be dropped by\n      the firewall.\n\
    \      The HoTI is a Mobility Header packet, and as the protocol type\n      differs\
    \ from the established state in the firewall (see (2)), the\n      HoTI packet\
    \ will also be dropped.\n      As a consequence, the RRT cannot be completed,\
    \ and route\n      optimization cannot be applied.  Every packet has to go through\n\
    \      Node B's home agent and tunneled between B's home agent and B.\n      \

    \ or desirable,\n      since currently the firewall does not have any means to\
    \ verify the\n      validity of Binding Update messages and therefore to modify\
    \ the\n      state information securely.  Changing the firewall states without\n\
    \      verifying the validity of the Binding Update messages could lead\n    \
    \  to denial of service attacks.  Malicious nodes may send fake\n      binding\
    \ updates, forcing the firewall to change its state\n      information, and therefore\
    \ leading the firewall to drop packets\n      from the connections that use the\
    \ legitimate addresses.  An\n      adversary might also use an address update\

    \    successful.  The CN may be protected by different firewalls, and\n      as\
    \ a result of the MN's change of IP address, incoming and\n      outgoing traffic\
    \ may pass through a different firewall.  The new\n      firewall may not have\
    \ any state associated with the CN, and\n      incoming packets (and potentially\
    \ outgoing traffic as well) may be\n      dropped at the firewall.\n      Firewall\
    \ technology allows clusters of firewalls to share state\n      [3].  This, for\
    \ example, allows the support of routing asymmetry.\n      However, if the previous\
    \ and the new firewalls, through which the\n      packets are routed after the\
    \ Binding Update has been sent, do not\n      share state, this may result in\
    \ packets being dropped at the new\n      firewall.  As the new firewall does\
    \ not have any state associated\n      with the CN, incoming packets (and potentially\
    \ outgoing traffic as\n      well) may be dropped at the new firewall.\n"

  - "5.3.  Scenario Where the HA Is in a Network Protected by Firewall(s)\n   In the\
    \ scenarios where the home agent is in a network protected by\n   firewall(s),\
    \ the following issues may exist:\n   Issue 1: If the firewall(s) protecting the\
    \ home agent block ESP\n      traffic, much of the MIPv6 signaling (e.g., Binding\
    \ Update, HoT)\n      may be dropped at the firewall(s), preventing MN(s) from\
    \ updating\n      their binding cache and performing Route Optimization, since\n\
    \      Binding Update, HoT, and other MIPv6 signaling must be protected\n    \
    \  by IPsec ESP.\n   Issue 2: If the firewall(s) protecting the home agent block\n\
    \      unsolicited incoming traffic (e.g., as stateful inspection packet\n   \
    \   filters do), the firewall(s) may drop connection setup requests\n      from\
    \ CNs, and packets from MNs.\n   Issue 3: If the home agent is in a network protected\
    \ by several\n      firewalls, an MN/CN's change of IP address may result in the\n\
    \      passage of traffic to and from the home agent through a different\n   \
    \   firewall that may not have the states corresponding to the flows.\n      As\
    \ a consequence, packets may be dropped at the firewall.\n"
- title: 5.4.  Scenario Where the MN Moves to a Network Protected by Firewall(s)
  contents:
  - "5.4.  Scenario Where the MN Moves to a Network Protected by Firewall(s)\n   Let's\
    \ consider an HA in a network protected by firewall(s).  The\n   following issues\
    \ need to be investigated:\n   Issue 1: Similarly to issue 1 described in Section\
    \ 5.1, the MN will\n      send a Binding Update to its home agent after acquiring\
    \ a local IP\n      address (CoA).  The Binding Updates and Acknowledgements should\
    \ be\n      protected by IPsec ESP according to the MIPv6 specifications [1].\n\
    \      However, as a default rule, many firewalls drop ESP packets.  This\n  \
    \    may cause the Binding Updates and Acknowledgements between the\n      mobile\
    \ nodes and their home agent to be dropped.\n   Issue 2: The MN may be in a communication\
    \ with a CN, or a CN may be\n      attempting to establish a connection with the\
    \ MN.  In both cases,\n      packets sent from the CN will be forwarded by the\
    \ MN's HA to the\n      MN's CoA.  However, when the packets arrive at the firewall(s),\n\
    \      the incoming traffic may not match any existing state, and the\n      firewall(s)\
    \ may therefore drop it.\n   Issue 3: If the MN is in a communication with a CN,\
    \ the MN may\n      attempt to execute an RRT for packets to be route optimized.\n\
    \      Similarly to issue 3, Section 5.1, the Home Test message that\n      should\
    \ be protected by ESP may be dropped by firewall(s)\n      protecting the MN.\
    \  Firewall(s) may as a default rule drop any ESP\n      traffic.  As a consequence,\
    \ the RRT cannot be completed.\n   Issue 4: If the MN is in a communication with\
    \ a CN, and assuming that\n      the MN successfully sent a Binding Update to\
    \ its CN to use Route\n      Optimization, packets will then be sent from the\
    \ CN to the MN's\n      CoA and from the MN's CoA to the CN.\n      Packets sent\
    \ from the CN to the MN's CoA may, however, not match\n      any existing entry\
    \ in the firewall(s) protecting the MN, and\n      therefore be dropped by the\
    \ firewall(s).\n      If packet filtering is applied to uplink traffic (i.e.,\
    \ traffic\n      sent by the MN), packets sent from the MN's CoA to the CN may\
    \ not\n      match any entry in the firewall(s) either and may be dropped as\n\
    \      well.\n"

  - "6.  Conclusions\n   Current firewalls may not only prevent route optimization\
    \ but may\n   also prevent regular TCP and UDP sessions from being established\
    \ in\n   some cases.  This document describes some of the issues between the\n\
    \   Mobile IPv6 protocol and current firewall technologies.\n   This document\
    \ captures the various issues involved in the deployment\n   of Mobile IPv6 in\
    \ networks that would invariably include firewalls.\n   A number of different\
    \ scenarios are described, which include\n   configurations where the mobile node,\
    \ correspondent node, and home\n   agent exist across various boundaries delimited\
    \ by the firewalls.\n   This enables a better understanding of the issues when\
    \ deploying\n   Mobile IPv6 as well as the issues for firewall design and policies\
    \ to\n   be installed therein.\n"
