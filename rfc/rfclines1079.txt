Motivation Most operating systems have provisions to keep track of the speed (bit rate) of directly attached terminals and modems.
This information is used to control various timing dependent display processes, e.g., the number of padding characters used for delay.
Some software also has user interfaces that are tuned differently for fast and slow terminals.
The purpose of this option is to provide similar information for telnet connections.
Command Name and Code TERMINAL SPEED Code
TERMINAL SPEED Sender is willing to send terminal speed information in a subsequent sub negotiation.
IAC WON'T TERMINAL SPEED Sender refuses to send terminal speed information.
IAC DO TERMINAL SPEED Sender is willing to receive terminal speed information in a subsequent sub negotiation.
IAC DON'T TERMINAL SPEED Sender refuses to accept terminal speed information.
IAC SB TERMINAL SPEED SEND IAC SE Sender requests receiver to transmit his (the receiver's) terminal speed.
The code for SEND is 1.
IAC SB TERMINAL SPEED IS ...
IAC SE Sender is stating his terminal speed.
The code for IS is 0.
TERMINAL SPEED Terminal speed information will not be exchanged.
TERMINAL SPEED Terminal speed information will not be exchanged.
Description of the Option WILL and DO are used only to obtain and grant permission for future discussion.
Once the two hosts have exchanged a WILL and a DO, the sender of the DO TERMINAL SPEED is free to request speed information.
Only the sender of the DO may send requests (IAC SB TERMINAL SPEED SEND IAC SE) and only the sender of the WILL may transmit actual speed information (within an IAC SB TERMINAL SPEED IS ...
Terminal speed information may not be sent spontaneously, but only in response to a request.
The terminal speed information is an NVT ASCII string.
This string contains the decimal representation of the transmit and receive speeds of the terminal, separated by a comma, e.g., 9600,100 No leading zeros may be included.
No extraneous characters such as spaces may be included.
The following is an example of use of the option:
IAC WILL TERMINAL SPEED (Host1 is now free to request status information at any time.)
IAC SB TERMINAL SPEED SEND IAC SE Host2: IAC SB TERMINAL SPEED IS "1200,1200" IAC SE (This command is 15 octets.)
Many systems allow only certain discrete terminal speeds.
In such cases it is possible that a speed may be received that does not match one of the allowed values.
We suggest that you pick the nearest speed that is allowed, rounding in a "safe" direction.
Safety will depend upon the use of the speed information.
If it is being used for padding, it is best to round up, since too much padding is better than too little.
