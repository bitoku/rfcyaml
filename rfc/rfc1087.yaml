- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   At great human and economic cost, resources drawn from the U.S.\n\
    \   Government, industry and the academic community have been assembled\n   into\
    \ a collection of interconnected networks called the Internet.\n   Begun as a\
    \ vehicle for experimental network research in the mid-\n   1970's, the Internet\
    \ has become an important national infrastructure\n   supporting an increasingly\
    \ widespread, multi-disciplinary community\n   of researchers ranging, inter alia,\
    \ from computer scientists and\n   electrical engineers to mathematicians, physicists,\
    \ medical\n   researchers, chemists, astronomers and space scientists.\n   As\
    \ is true of other common infrastructures (e.g., roads, water\n   reservoirs and\
    \ delivery systems, and the power generation and\n   distribution network), there\
    \ is widespread dependence on the Internet\n   by its users for the support of\
    \ day-to-day research activities.\n   The reliable operation of the Internet and\
    \ the responsible use of its\n   resources is of common interest and concern for\
    \ its users, operators\n   and sponsors.  Recent events involving the hosts on\
    \ the Internet and\n   in similar network infrastructures underscore the need\
    \ to reiterate\n   the professional responsibility every Internet user bears to\n\
    \   colleagues and to the sponsors of the system.  Many of the Internet\n   resources\
    \ are provided by the U.S. Government.  Abuse of the system\n   thus becomes a\
    \ Federal matter above and beyond simple professional\n   ethics.\n"
- title: IAB Statement of Policy
  contents:
  - "IAB Statement of Policy\n   The Internet is a national facility whose utility\
    \ is largely a\n   consequence of its wide availability and accessibility.\n \
    \  Irresponsible use of this critical resource poses an enormous threat\n   to\
    \ its continued availability to the technical community.\n   The U.S. Government\
    \ sponsors of this system have a fiduciary\n   responsibility to the public to\
    \ allocate government resources wisely\n   and effectively.  Justification for\
    \ the support of this system\n   suffers when highly disruptive abuses occur.\
    \  Access to and use of\n   the Internet is a privilege and should be treated\
    \ as such by all\n   users of this system.\n   The IAB strongly endorses the view\
    \ of the Division Advisory Panel of\n   the National Science Foundation Division\
    \ of Network, Communications\n   Research and Infrastructure which, in paraphrase,\
    \ characterized as\n   unethical and unacceptable any activity which purposely:\n\
    \      (a) seeks to gain unauthorized access to the resources of the\n       \
    \   Internet,\n      (b) disrupts the intended use of the Internet,\n      (c)\
    \ wastes resources (people, capacity, computer) through such\n          actions,\n\
    \      (d) destroys the integrity of computer-based information,\n   and/or\n\
    \      (e) compromises the privacy of users.\n   The Internet exists in the general\
    \ research milieu.  Portions of it\n   continue to be used to support research\
    \ and experimentation on\n   networking.  Because experimentation on the Internet\
    \ has the\n   potential to affect all of its components and users, researchers\
    \ have\n   the responsibility to exercise great caution in the conduct of their\n\
    \   work.  Negligence in the conduct of Internet-wide experiments is both\n  \
    \ irresponsible and unacceptable.\n   The IAB plans to take whatever actions it\
    \ can, in concert with\n   Federal agencies and other interested parties, to identify\
    \ and to set\n   up technical and procedural mechanisms to make the Internet more\n\
    \   resistant to disruption.  Such security, however, may be extremely\n   expensive\
    \ and may be counterproductive if it inhibits the free flow\n   of information\
    \ which makes the Internet so valuable.  In the final\n   analysis, the health\
    \ and well-being of the Internet is the\n   responsibility of its users who must,\
    \ uniformly, guard against abuses\n   which disrupt the system and threaten its\
    \ long-term viability.\n"
