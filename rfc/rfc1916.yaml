  - "1. Introduction\n   There are immediate and increasingly severe requirements\
    \ to renumber\n   both small and large-scale networks. The Procedures for\n  \
    \ Internet/Enterprise Renumbering (PIER) working group in the IETF\n   urgently\
    \ requests specific input for producing concrete guidance for\n   the renumbering\
    \ task as quickly as possible.  As part of collecting\n   such information, the\
    \ PIER working group therefore is soliciting\n   input from people and organizations\
    \ with experience in changing the\n   IP addresses of enterprise networks or in\
    \ making major changes in the\n   subnetting of existing networks. We are especially\
    \ interested in\n   actual case studies -- that is, accounts describing what was\
    \ actually\n   done to renumber one or more networks.  Information is also solicited\n\
    \   on specific tools used in the process, and on areas in which tools\n   were\
    \ needed but not available.  Because applications that use IP\n   addresses directly\
    \ in their configuration or security mechanisms pose\n   specific difficulties\
    \ and coordination issues for renumbering, a\n   catalogue of such applications\
    \ is being compiled.\n   All interested parties are invited to submit material\
    \ in any of these\n   areas:\n   A) Accounts of the experience of renumbering\
    \ networks:\n   -- Retrospective reports on renumbering efforts.\n   -- Journals\
    \ or running accounts of a renumbering effort, written\n      while the task is\
    \ underway.\n   B) Information on tools to help renumbering:\n   -- Descriptions\
    \ of tools used, whether commercial, freeware, or ad\n      hoc (such as perl\
    \ scripts).\n   -- Descriptions of specific needs where a tool could clearly have\n\
    \      helped, but none was found.\n   C) Information on applications using embedded\
    \ IP addresses:\n   -- Software applications that use embedded IP addresses for\
    \ security\n      keys, authentication, or any other \"inappropriate\" purposes.\n\
    \   -- Hardware devices whose IP addresses are hardcoded into the\n      hardware\
    \ design (and so may require extensive time lags to\n      retool).\n   -- Both\
    \ software and hardware whose vendors are no longer in business\n      and that\
    \ may require replacement or specialized solutions.\n   The focus of this solicitation\
    \ is on experience with renumbering that\n   has been done or is now underway\
    \ in IPv4 networks, and not on future\n   changes to protocols or environments\
    \ that may eventually be useful.\n   We are especially concerned with the most\
    \ common situation faced\n   today: single-homed networks that are not transit\
    \ providers. However,\n   experience with renumbering more complex environments\
    \ is also\n   welcome.\n   The information provided will be used as an information\
    \ base from\n   which at least three documents will be composed: a document\n\
    \   summarizing the processes to follow when renumbering, a document\n   describing\
    \ the available tools, and a document containing a list of\n   known applications\
    \ requiring special attention when renumbering. The\n   information will also\
    \ be available on the PIER home page,\n   http://www.isi.edu/div7/pier. More specific\
    \ reports on renumbering\n   particular environments may also be produced in those\
    \ cases where\n   enough information is received from the community.\n   Although\
    \ our emphasis is on technical issues and responses, solidly\n   based advice\
    \ on smoothing the human problems is also appreciated.\n   Political and cultural\
    \ sensitivities, and handling them, are major\n   issues in the real world.\n\
    \   There is no requirement that a formal document be submitted, although\n  \
    \ with the permission of the submitter, selected accounts of experience\n   in\
    \ renumbering will be published by PIER as part of their planned\n   series of\
    \ case studies. If you wish to have your account released as\n   a PIER case study,\
    \ please follow the standard RFC format described in\n   RFC 1543, \"Instructions\
    \ to RFC Authors\". (For convenience, these\n   formatting rules are given in\
    \ Appendix A below.)\n   The people and organization(s) involved and the network(s)\
    \ renumbered\n   need not be identified in any document made public by PIER: please\n\
    \   explicitly indicate if a submission should have its anonymity\n   protected.\n\
    \   The deadline for the submission of your information is May 15, 1996,\n   though\
    \ early submission is encouraged. Any information, however\n   informally written,\
    \ that can be submitted earlier, would be greatly\n   appreciated and will help\
    \ shape the further work of the PIER group.\n   In particular, if you expect to\
    \ submit a detailed write-up by May 15,\n   1996, please let us know as soon as\
    \ possible.\n   Please send submissions, questions, or suggestions to the PIER\n\
    \   discussion list, pier@isi.edu.\n   To subscribe to the PIER discussion list,\
    \ please send your request to\n   pier-request@isi.edu. Further information on\
    \ PIER is available on the\n   PIER home page, http://www.isi.edu/div7/pier.\n\
    \   Mail may also be sent directly to the editors, without its appearing\n   on\
    \ the PIER list, by sending to pier-solicit@bellcore.com.\n"
- title: 2.  Renumbering Experience
  contents:
  - "2.  Renumbering Experience\n   An account of a renumbering effort should provide\
    \ enough concrete\n   information, based on actual experience, so that the reader\
    \ can\n   understand exactly what was done. Broadly speaking, we anticipate two\n\
    \   styles of account:\n   i) Retrospective reports\n      Based on one or more\
    \ renumbering efforts, recapitulate what was\n      done and what was learned\
    \ in the effort. Such a report should\n      describe:\n      -- The environment\
    \ being renumbered.\n      -- The planning undertaken.\n      -- What was done.\n\
    \      -- What worked.\n      -- What didn't (unanticipated issues, problems with\
    \ planned\n         approaches).\n      In addition, the report would be even\
    \ more useful if it also\n      addressed:\n      -- The reasons for taking the\
    \ approach chosen.\n      -- Any alternative approaches that were rejected, and\
    \ why.\n      -- What could have been done in advance to make the task easier.\n\
    \      -- Lessons learned: how would you do it next time?\n      It is hoped that\
    \ individuals and organizations that have already\n      been through a renumbering\
    \ effort could quickly look back over\n      their experiences, and capture their\
    \ knowledge.\n   ii) Running accounts\n      Many people are in the midst of a\
    \ renumbering effort, or are about\n      to embark on one in the next few months.\
    \ If, in the midst of that\n      hectic task, one could write down a brief account\
    \ or \"diary\" of\n      what actually happens, as it happens, such a report is\
    \ likely to\n      capture the glitches and fixes of even the best-planned effort\n\
    \      more accurately than any retrospective.\n   Of course, these are only rough\
    \ categories: any record of the\n   experience of renumbering or of information\
    \ gained by such experience\n   can be a valuable contribution to PIER. When submitting\
    \ accounts of\n   renumbering efforts, please attempt to be as articulate and\
    \ concise\n   as possible.\n"
- title: 3.  Information on Tools
  contents:
  - "3.  Information on Tools\n   Information on the tools that were used in renumbering\
    \ is valuable,\n   whether provided as a separate note or as part of an account\
    \ of a\n   renumbering effort. We welcome comments, however detailed or brief,\n\
    \   on any tools that helped with renumbering, whether or not you intend\n   to\
    \ produce an account of the entire renumbering effort.\n   Some areas in which\
    \ tools may be used in renumbering include:\n   -- Identifying what needs to be\
    \ changed in your network, such as\n      configuration files, hosts and servers\
    \ with embedded or cached IP\n      addresses, DNS, access control lists (ACLs),\
    \ firewalls, routers,\n      license servers, and other applications.\n   -- Identifying\
    \ external factors (such as remote servers, routers, and\n      Internet registries)\
    \ that need to be updated to accommodate your\n      new numbers.\n   -- Identifying\
    \ dependencies between the different places where the\n      numbers must be updated.\n\
    \   -- Notifying external agents.\n   -- Generating the new information (such\
    \ as routing, configuration,\n      and ACLs) required in order to carry out the\
    \ updates.\n   -- Coordinating updates.\n   -- Making the updates.\n   -- Verifying\
    \ the updates.\n   -- Trouble-shooting and debugging.\n   -- Maintaining network\
    \ functionality.\n   -- Informing your users and other affected human beings (such\
    \ as NOC\n      staff) of the changes.\n   The most useful tools are those that\
    \ are, or can be, available to\n   other renumbering efforts. For a given tool,\
    \ it would be helpful to\n   describe:\n   -- How to obtain it (if not a well-known\
    \ tool).\n   -- What you used it for.\n   -- How you used it.\n   -- What its\
    \ strengths and limitations are for these specific uses.\n   If a tool was created\
    \ as part of the renumbering effort, a\n   description of exactly what it does\
    \ should be included. (For example,\n   a script to check for IP addresses in\
    \ configuration files on user\n   machines should be described in terms of just\
    \ what it did to obtain\n   the list of machines, what files it looked for, and\
    \ how it checked\n   them.)\n   Although the primary goal of this solicitation\
    \ is to learn what tools\n   exist and are useful, we also value specific, experience-based\n\
    \   descriptions of ways in which tools could have helped even though\n   nothing\
    \ was available during the renumbering to perform these\n   functions. Advisories\
    \ on tools that appear to be useful but in\n   practice created further problems\
    \ may also be considered, as\n   appropriate.\n"
- title: 4.  Application Information
  contents:
  - "4.  Application Information\n   Information on applications that require special\
    \ attention when\n   renumbering are of particular interest, since specialized\n\
    \   applications are among the most difficult aspects of renumbering.  It\n  \
    \ typically requires special intervention with the vendor to provide\n   new security\
    \ keys, new license addresses, new versions of\n   applications, or perhaps even\
    \ new hardware or proms to change the\n   hardcoded IP addresses.\n   A list of\
    \ any such applications that required \"extra\" efforts during\n   the renumbering\
    \ process is valuable. Please include as much specific\n   information as possible,\
    \ including but not limited to: application\n   name, version, platform, vendor,\
    \ operating system, operating system\n   version, the steps taken to overcome\
    \ the problem, and lead times\n   needed.\n   In particular, any applications\
    \ that are no longer supported, or\n   whose vendor has ceased to do business,\
    \ are extremely important since\n   these applications will likely be some of\
    \ the more difficult issues a\n   renumbering effort will encounter.  Any solutions\
    \ to these types of\n   problems, including replacement applications and proprietary\n\
    \   solutions, are also sought.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This RFC raises no security issues, although\
    \ accounts of renumbering\n   are encouraged to describe any security issues encountered,\
    \ any tools\n   that helped identify or resolve the issues, and the actions taken\
    \ to\n   address them. Submissions should give serious consideration to the\n\
    \   content and context of issues regarding security.\n"
