Abstract The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
[1] defines a network representation of a search filter transmitted to an LDAP server.
Some applications may find it useful to have a common way of representing these search filters in a human readable form.
This document defines a human readable string format for representing LDAP search filters.
An LDAP search filter is defined in [1] as follows:
OCTET STRING where the LDAPString above is limited to the IA5 character set.
The AttributeType is a string representation of the attribute object identifier in dotted OID format (e.g., "2.5.4.10"), or the shorter string name of the attribute (e.g., "organizationName", or "o").
OCTET STRING has the form defined in [2].
The Filter is encoded for transmission over a network using the Basic Encoding Rules defined in [3], with simplifications described in [1].
2.  String Search Filter Definition
The string representation of an LDAP search filter is defined by the following BNF.
It uses a prefix format.
> <attr> is a string representing an AttributeType, and has the format defined in [1].
<value> is a string representing an AttributeValue, or part of one, and has the form defined in [2].
This section gives a few examples of search filters written using this notation.
Security Considerations Security issues are not discussed in this memo.
