IAC WILL EXOPL The sender of this command requests permission to begin negotiating, or confirms that it will begin negotiating, TELNET options which are on the "Extended Options List".
The sender of this command REFUSES to negotiate, or to continue negotiating, options on the "Extended Options List".
IAC DON'T EXOPL The sender of this command
DEMANDS that the receiver conduct no further negotiation of options on the "Extended Options List".
The subcommand contains information required for the negotiation of an option of the "Extended Options List".
The format of the subcommand is discussed in section 5 below.
Default WON'T EXOPL, DON'T EXOPL Negotiation of options on the "Extended Options List" is not permitted.
Eventually, a 257th TELNET option will be needed.
This option will extend the option list for another 256 options in a manner which is easy to implement.
The option is proposed now, rather than later (probably much later), in order to reserve the option number (255).
An Abstract Description of the Option
The EXOPL option has five subcommand codes:  WILL, WON'T, DO, DON'T, and SB.
They have exactly the same meanings as the TELNET commands with the same names, and are used in exactly the same way.
For consistency, these subcommand codes will have the same values as the TELNET command codes (250 254).
Thus, the format for negotiating a specific option on the "Extended Options List" (once both parties have agreed to use it) is: IAC SB EXOPL DO/DON'T/
Once both sides have agreed to use the specific option specified by <option code
>, subnegotiation may be required.
In this case the format to be used is: IAC SB EXOPL SB <option code
