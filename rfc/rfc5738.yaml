- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This specification extends IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501] to permit\
    \ UTF-8\n   [RFC3629] in headers as described in \"Internationalized Email\n \
    \  Headers\" [RFC5335].  It also adds a mechanism to support mailbox\n   names,\
    \ login names, and passwords using the UTF-8 charset.  This\n   specification\
    \ creates five new IMAP capabilities to allow servers to\n   advertise these new\
    \ extensions, along with two new IMAP LIST\n   selection options and a new IMAP\
    \ LIST return option.\n"
- title: 2.  Conventions Used in This Document
  contents:
  - "2.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", and \"MAY\"\n   in this document are to be interpreted\
    \ as defined in \"Key words for\n   use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels\"\
    \ [RFC2119].\n   The formal syntax uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)\n\
    \   [RFC5234] notation including the core rules defined in Appendix B of\n   [RFC5234].\
    \  In addition, rules from IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501], UTF-8\n   [RFC3629], \"Collected\
    \ Extensions to IMAP4 ABNF\" [RFC4466], and IMAP4\n   LIST Command Extensions\
    \ [RFC5258] are also referenced.\n   In examples, \"C:\" and \"S:\" indicate lines\

- title: 3.  UTF8=ACCEPT IMAP Capability
  contents:
  - "3.  UTF8=ACCEPT IMAP Capability\n   The \"UTF8=ACCEPT\" capability indicates\
    \ that the server supports UTF-8\n   quoted strings, the \"UTF8\" parameter to\
    \ SELECT and EXAMINE, and UTF-8\n   responses from the LIST and LSUB commands.\n\
    \   A client MUST use the \"ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT\" command (defined in\n   [RFC5161])\
    \ to indicate to the server that the client accepts UTF-8\n   quoted-strings.\
    \  The \"ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT\" command MUST only be used\n   in the authenticated\
    \ state.  (Note that the \"UTF8=ONLY\" capability\n   described in Section 7 and\
    \ the \"UTF8=ALL\" capability described in\n   Section 6 imply the \"UTF8=ACCEPT\"\
    \ capability.  See additional\n   information in these sections.)\n"
- title: 3.1.  IMAP UTF-8 Quoted Strings
  contents:
  - "3.1.  IMAP UTF-8 Quoted Strings\n   The IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501] base specification\
    \ forbids the use of 8-bit\n   characters in atoms or quoted strings.  Thus, a\
    \ UTF-8 string can only\n   be sent as a literal.  This can be inconvenient from\
    \ a coding\n   standpoint, and unless the server offers IMAP4 non-synchronizing\n\
    \   literals [RFC2088], this requires an extra round trip for each UTF-8\n   string\
    \ sent by the client.  When the IMAP server advertises the\n   \"UTF8=ACCEPT\"\
    \ capability, it informs the client that it supports\n   native UTF-8 quoted-strings\
    \ with the following syntax:\n     string        =/ utf8-quoted\n     utf8-quoted\
    \   = \"*\" DQUOTE *UQUOTED-CHAR DQUOTE\n     UQUOTED-CHAR  = QUOTED-CHAR / UTF8-2\
    \ / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4\n                ; UTF8-2, UTF8-3, and UTF8-4 are as defined\
    \ in RFC 3629\n   When this quoting mechanism is used by the client (specifically\
    \ an\n   octet sequence beginning with *\" and ending with \"), then the server\n\
    \   MUST reject octet sequences with the high bit set that fail to comply\n  \
    \ with the formal syntax in [RFC3629] with a BAD response.\n   The IMAP server\
    \ MUST NOT send utf8-quoted syntax to the client unless\n   the client has indicated\
    \ support for that syntax by using the \"ENABLE\n   UTF8=ACCEPT\" command.\n \
    \  If the server advertises the \"UTF8=ACCEPT\" capability, the client MAY\n \
    \  use utf8-quoted syntax with any IMAP argument that permits a string\n   (including\
    \ astring and nstring).  However, if characters outside the\n   US-ASCII repertoire\
    \ are used in an inappropriate place, the results\n   would be the same as if\
    \ other syntactically valid but semantically\n   invalid characters were used.\
    \  For example, if the client includes\n   UTF-8 characters in the user or password\
    \ arguments (and the server\n   has not advertised \"UTF8=USER\"), the LOGIN command\
    \ will fail as it\n   would with any other invalid user name or password.  Specific\
    \ cases\n   where UTF-8 characters are permitted or not permitted are described\n\
    \   in the following paragraphs.\n   All IMAP servers that advertise the \"UTF8=ACCEPT\"\
    \ capability SHOULD\n   accept UTF-8 in mailbox names, and those that also support\
    \ the\n   \"Mailbox International Naming Convention\" described in RFC 3501,\n\
    \   Section 5.1.3 MUST accept utf8-quoted mailbox names and convert them\n   to\
    \ the appropriate internal format.  Mailbox names MUST comply with\n   the Net-Unicode\
    \ Definition (Section 2 of [RFC5198]) with the specific\n   exception that they\
    \ MUST NOT contain control characters (0000-001F,\n   0080-009F), delete (007F),\
    \ line separator (2028), or paragraph\n   separator (2029).\n   An IMAP client\
    \ MUST NOT issue a SEARCH command that uses a mixture of\n   utf8-quoted syntax\
    \ and a SEARCH CHARSET other than UTF-8.  If an IMAP\n   server receives such\
    \ a SEARCH command, it SHOULD reject the command\n   with a BAD response (due\
    \ to the conflicting charset labels).\n"
- title: 3.2.  UTF8 Parameter to SELECT and EXAMINE
  contents:
  - "3.2.  UTF8 Parameter to SELECT and EXAMINE\n   The \"UTF8=ACCEPT\" capability\
    \ also indicates that the server supports\n   the \"UTF8\" parameter to SELECT\
    \ and EXAMINE.  When a mailbox is\n   selected with the \"UTF8\" parameter, it\
    \ alters the behavior of all\n   IMAP commands related to message sizes, message\
    \ headers, and MIME\n   body headers so they refer to the message with UTF-8 headers.\
    \  If the\n   mailstore is not UTF-8 header native and the SELECT or EXAMINE\n\
    \   command with UTF-8 header modifier succeeds, then the server MUST\n   return\
    \ results as if the mailstore were UTF-8 header native with\n   upconversion requirements\
    \ as described in Section 8.  The server MAY\n   reject the SELECT or EXAMINE\
    \ command with the [NOT-UTF-8] response\n   code, unless the \"UTF8=ALL\" or \"\
    UTF8=ONLY\" capability is advertised.\n   Servers MAY include mailboxes that can\
    \ only be selected or examined\n   if the \"UTF8\" parameter is provided.  However,\
    \ such mailboxes MUST\n   NOT be included in the output of an unextended LIST,\
    \ LSUB, or\n   equivalent command.  If a client attempts to SELECT or EXAMINE\
    \ such\n   mailboxes without the \"UTF8\" parameter, the server MUST reject the\n\
    \   command with a [UTF-8-ONLY] response code.  As a result, such\n   mailboxes\
    \ will not be accessible by IMAP clients written prior to\n   this specification\
    \ and are discouraged unless the server advertises\n   \"UTF8=ONLY\" or the server\
    \ implements IMAP4 LIST Command Extensions\n   [RFC5258].\n     utf8-select-param\
    \ = \"UTF8\"\n               ;; Conforms to <select-param> from RFC 4466\n   \

    \ funky-new-mailbox\n     S: d NO [UTF-8-ONLY] Mailbox requires UTF-8 client\n"
- title: 3.3.  UTF-8 LIST and LSUB Responses
  contents:
  - "3.3.  UTF-8 LIST and LSUB Responses\n   After an IMAP client successfully issues\
    \ an \"ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT\"\n   command, the server MUST NOT return in LIST results\
    \ any mailbox names\n   to the client following the IMAP4 Mailbox International\
    \ Naming\n   Convention.  Instead, the server MUST return any mailbox names with\n\
    \   characters outside the US-ASCII repertoire using utf8-quoted syntax.\n   (The\
    \ IMAP4 Mailbox International Naming Convention has proved\n   problematic in\
    \ the past, so the desire is to make this syntax\n   obsolete as quickly as possible.)\n"
- title: 3.4.  UTF-8 Interaction with IMAP4 LIST Command Extensions
  contents:
  - "3.4.  UTF-8 Interaction with IMAP4 LIST Command Extensions\n   When an IMAP server\
    \ advertises both the \"UTF8=ACCEPT\" capability and\n   the \"LIST-EXTENDED\"\
    \ [RFC5258] capability, the server MUST support the\n   LIST extensions described\
    \ in this section.\n"
- title: 3.4.1.  UTF8 and UTF8ONLY LIST Selection Options
  contents:
  - "3.4.1.  UTF8 and UTF8ONLY LIST Selection Options\n   The \"UTF8\" LIST selection\
    \ option tells the server to include\n   mailboxes that only support UTF-8 headers\
    \ in the output of the list\n   command.  The \"UTF8ONLY\" LIST selection option\
    \ tells the server to\n   include all mailboxes that support UTF-8 headers and\
    \ to exclude\n   mailboxes that don't support UTF-8 headers.  Note that \"UTF8ONLY\"\
    \n   implies \"UTF8\", so it is not necessary for the client to request\n   both.\
    \  Use of either selection option will also result in UTF-8\n   mailbox names\
    \ in the result as described in Section 3.3 and implies\n   the \"UTF8\" List\
    \ return option described in Section 3.4.2.\n"
- title: 3.4.2.  UTF8 LIST Return Option
  contents:
  - "3.4.2.  UTF8 LIST Return Option\n   If the client supplies the \"UTF8\" LIST\
    \ return option, then the server\n   MUST include either the \"\\NoUTF8\" or the\
    \ \"\\UTF8Only\" mailbox\n   attribute as appropriate.  The \"\\NoUTF8\" mailbox\
    \ attribute indicates\n   that an attempt to SELECT or EXAMINE that mailbox with\
    \ the \"UTF8\"\n   parameter will fail with a [NOT-UTF-8] response code.  The\n\
    \   \"\\UTF8Only\" mailbox attribute indicates that an attempt to SELECT or\n\
    \   EXAMINE that mailbox without the \"UTF8\" parameter will fail with a\n   [UTF-8-ONLY]\
    \ response code.  Note that computing this information may\n   be expensive on\
    \ some server implementations, so this return option\n   should not be used unless\
    \ necessary.\n   The ABNF [RFC5234] for these LIST extensions follows:\n     list-select-independent-opt\

- title: 4.  UTF8=APPEND Capability
  contents:
  - "4.  UTF8=APPEND Capability\n   If the \"UTF8=APPEND\" capability is advertised,\
    \ then the server\n   accepts UTF-8 headers in the APPEND command message argument.\
    \  A\n   client that sends a message with UTF-8 headers to the server MUST\n \
    \  send them using the \"UTF8\" APPEND data extension.  If the server also\n \
    \  advertises the CATENATE capability (as specified in [RFC4469]), the\n   client\
    \ can use the same data extension to include such a message in a\n   CATENATE\
    \ message part.  The ABNF for the APPEND data extension and\n   CATENATE extension\
    \ follows:\n     utf8-literal   = \"UTF8\" SP \"(\" literal8 \")\"\n     append-data\
    \    =/ utf8-literal\n     cat-part       =/ utf8-literal\n   A server that advertises\

    \   Internationalized eMail Address (IMA) [RFC5504].\n   IMAP servers that do\

    \ an APPEND command that includes any 8-bit in\n   the message headers with a\
    \ \"NO\" response.\n   Note that the \"UTF8=ONLY\" capability described in Section\
    \ 7 implies\n   the \"UTF8=APPEND\" capability.  See additional information in\

- title: 7.  UTF8=ONLY Capability

  - "7.  UTF8=ONLY Capability\n   The \"UTF8=ONLY\" capability permits an IMAP server\
    \ to advertise that\n   it does not support the international mailbox name convention\n\
    \   (modified UTF-7), and does not permit selection or examination of any\n  \
    \ mailbox unless the \"UTF8\" parameter is provided.  As this is an\n   incompatible\
    \ change to IMAP, a clear warning is necessary.  IMAP\n   clients that find implementation\
    \ of the \"UTF8=ONLY\" capability\n   problematic are encouraged to at least detect\
    \ the \"UTF8=ONLY\"\n   capability and provide an informative error message to\
    \ the end-user.\n   When an IMAP mailbox internally uses UTF-8 header native storage,\
    \ the\n   down-conversion step is necessary to permit selection or examination\n\
    \   of the mailbox in a backwards compatible fashion will become more\n   difficult\
    \ to support.  Although it is hoped that deployed IMAP\n   servers will not advertise\
    \ \"UTF8=ONLY\" for some years, this\n   capability is intended to minimize the\
    \ disruption when legacy support\n   finally goes away.\n   The \"UTF8=ONLY\"\
    \ capability implies the \"UTF8=ACCEPT\" capability, the\n   \"UTF8=ALL\" capability,\
    \ and the \"UTF8=APPEND\" capability.  A server\n   that advertises \"UTF8=ONLY\"\

  - "8.  Up-Conversion Server Requirements\n   When an IMAP4 server uses a traditional\
    \ mailbox format that includes\n   7-bit headers and it chooses to permit access\
    \ to that mailbox with\n   the \"UTF8\" parameter, it MUST support minimal up-conversion\
    \ as\n   described in this section.\n   The server MUST support up-conversion\
    \ of the following address\n   header-fields in the message header: From, Sender,\
    \ To, CC, Bcc,\n   Resent-From, Resent-Sender, Resent-To, Resent-CC, Resent-Bcc,\

    \ those charsets in this conversion.\n   Up-conversion of MIME header encoding\
    \ of the following headers MUST\n   also be implemented: Subject, Date ([RFC5322]\
    \ comments only),\n   Comments, Keywords, and Content-Description.\n   Server\
    \ implementations also SHOULD up-convert all MIME body headers\n   [RFC2045],\
    \ SHOULD up-convert or remove the deprecated (and misused)\n   \"name\" parameter\
    \ [RFC1341] on Content-Type, and MUST up-convert the\n   Content-Disposition [RFC2183]\

- title: Appendix A.  Design Rationale
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Design Rationale\n   This non-normative section discusses the reasons\
    \ behind some of the\n   design choices in the above specification.\n   The basic\
    \ approach of advertising the ability to access a mailbox in\n   UTF-8 mode is\
    \ intended to permit graceful upgrade, including servers\n   that support multiple\
    \ mailbox formats.  In particular, it would be\n   undesirable to force conversion\
    \ of an entire server mailstore to\n   UTF-8 headers, so being able to phase-in\
    \ support for new mailboxes\n   and gradually migrate old mailboxes is permitted\
    \ by this design.\n   \"UTF8=USER\" is optional because many identity systems\
    \ are US-ASCII\n   only, so it's helpful to inform the client up front that UTF-8\
    \ won't\n   work.\n   \"UTF8=APPEND\" is optional because it effectively requires\
    \ IMAP server\n   support for down-conversion, which is a much more complex operation\n\
    \   than up-conversion.\n   The \"UTF8=ONLY\" mechanism simplifies diagnosis of\
    \ interoperability\n   problems when legacy support goes away.  In the situation\
    \ where\n   backwards compatibility is broken anyway, just-send-UTF-8 IMAP has\n\
    \   the advantage that it might work with some legacy clients.  However,\n   the\
    \ difficulty of diagnosing interoperability problems caused by a\n   just-send-UTF-8\
    \ IMAP mechanism is the reason the \"UTF8=ONLY\"\n   capability mechanism was\
    \ chosen.\n   The up-conversion requirements are designed to balance the desire\
    \ to\n   deprecate and eventually eliminate complicated encodings (like MIME\n\
    \   header encodings) without creating a significant deployment burden\n   for\
    \ servers.  As IMAP4 servers already require a MIME parser, this\n   includes\
    \ additional server up-conversion requirements not present in\n   POP3 Support\
    \ for UTF-8 [RFC5721].\n   The set of mandatory charsets comes from two sources:\
    \ MIME\n   requirements [RFC2049] and IETF Policy on Character Sets [RFC2277].\n\
    \   Including a requirement to up-convert widely deployed encoded\n   ideographic\
    \ charsets to UTF-8 would be reasonable for most scenarios,\n   but may require\
    \ unacceptable table sizes for some embedded devices.\n   The open-ended recommendation\
    \ to support widely deployed charsets\n   avoids the political ramifications of\
    \ attempting to list such\n   charsets.  The authors believe market forces, existing\
    \ open-source\n   software, and public conversion tables are sufficient to deploy\
    \ the\n   appropriate charsets.\n"
