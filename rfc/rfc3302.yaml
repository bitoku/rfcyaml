    - "4.1  TIFF Scope\n   TIFF describes image data that typically comes from scanners,
      frame\n   grabbers, and paint- and photo-retouching programs.  TIFF is not a\n
      \  printer language or page description language.  The purpose of TIFF\n   is
      to describe and store raster image data.  A primary goal of TIFF\n   is to provide
      a rich environment within which applications can\n   exchange image data.  This
      richness is required to take advantage of\n   the varying capabilities of scanners
      and other imaging devices.\n   Though TIFF is a rich format, it can easily be
      used for simple\n   scanners and applications as well because the number of
      required\n   fields is small.\n"

    - "4.2  TIFF Features\n   Some of the features of TIFF (from [TIFF]) are:\n      -
      \ TIFF is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-\n         color,
      and full-color image data in several color spaces.\n      -  TIFF includes a
      number of compression schemes that allow\n         developers to choose the
      best space or time tradeoff for their\n         applications.\n      -  TIFF
      is designed to be extensible and to evolve gracefully as\n         new needs
      arise.\n      -  TIFF allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private
      or\n         special-purpose information.\n"

    - "5.1  image/tiff\n   The image/tiff content-type was previously defined in RFC
      1528 as\n   containing TIFF 6.0 encoded image data, with specific reference
      made\n   to a subset known as TIFF Class F.  This document redefines the\n   original
      image/tiff definition to refer to TIFF 6.0 [TIFF] encoded\n   image data, consistent
      with existing practice for TIFF aware Internet\n   applications.  This definition
      is further enhanced by introducing the\n   new \"application parameter\" (section
      6.2) to enable identification of\n   a specific subset of TIFF and TIFF extensions
      for the encoded image\n   data.\n"
    title: 5.1  image/tiff
  - contents:
    - "5.2  Application parameter\n   There are cases where it may be useful to identify
      the application\n   applicable to the content of an image/tiff body.  Typically,
      this\n   would be used to assist the recipient in dispatching a suitable\n   rendering
      package to handle the display or processing of the image\n   file.  As a result,
      an optional \"application\" parameter is defined\n   for image/tiff to identify
      a particular application's subset of TIFF\n   and TIFF extensions for the encoded
      image data, if it is known.  No\n   values are defined in this document.\n      Example:\n
      \              Content-type: image/tiff; application=foo\n   There is no default
      value for application, as the absence of the\n   application parameter indicates
      that the encoded TIFF image is\n   Baseline TIFF or that it is not necessary
      to identify the\n   application.  It is up to the recipient's implementation
      to determine\n   the application (if necessary) and render the image to the
      user.\n   New values for the image/tiff application parameter must be approved\n
      \  by the IESG prior to registration.  As a result, the publication of a\n   description
      of parameter values in an RFC is required.\n   Guidelines on writing IANA considerations
      for RFCs can be found in\n   RFC 2434.\n   An application parameter is a hint
      to the receiver.  It MUST NOT be\n   used as a blind request to execute some
      arbitrary program.\n   Instead, it should be viewed rather as an indication
      of what sort of\n   application would be able to handle the content most appropriately.\n"

    of Standard MIME media type image/tiff\n      MIME media type name: image\n      MIME
    subtype name: tiff\n      Required parameters: none\n      Optional parameters:
    application\n         There is no format specified for the value of this parameter\n
    \        in addition to that specified by [MIME1].  Various\n         applications
    of TIFF may define values as required as hints\n         to the receiver.  There
    is no default value for application,\n         as the absence of the application
    parameter indicates that\n         the encoded TIFF image is Baseline TIFF or
    that it is not\n         necessary to identify the application.  It is up to the\n
    \        implementation to determine the application (if necessary)\n         and
    render the image to the user.\n      Encoding considerations:\n         This media
    type consists of binary data.  The base64 encoding\n         should be used on
    transports that cannot accommodate binary\n         data directly.\n      Security
    considerations:\n         TIFF utilizes a structure which can store image data
    and\n         attributes of this image data.  The fields defined in the TIFF\n
    \        specification are of a descriptive nature and provide\n         information
    that is useful to facilitate the viewing and\n         rendering of images by
    a recipient.  As such, the fields\n         currently defined in the TIFF specification
    do not in\n         themselves create additional security risks, since the fields\n
    \        are not used to induce any particular behavior by the\n         recipient
    application.\n         TIFF has an extensible structure, so that it is theoretically\n
    \        possible that fields could be defined in the future which\n         could
    be used to induce particular actions on the part of the\n         recipient, thus
    presenting additional security risks, but\n         this type of capability is
    not supported in the referenced\n         TIFF specification.  Indeed, the definition
    of fields which\n         would include such processing instructions is inconsistent\n
    \        with the goals and spirit of the TIFF specification as\n         defined
    to date.\n      Interoperability considerations:\n         The ability of implementations
    to handle all the defined\n         applications (or profiles within applications)
    of TIFF may\n         not be ubiquitous.  As a result, implementations may decode\n
    \        and attempt to display the encoded TIFF image data only to\n         determine
    that the image cannot be rendered.  The presence of\n         the application
    parameter may aid in allowing this\n         determination before dispatching
    for rendering.  However, it\n         should be noted that the parameter value
    is not intended to\n         convey levels of capabilities for a particular application.\n
