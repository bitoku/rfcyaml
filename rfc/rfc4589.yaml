  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document creates a registry for location type tokens.\
    \  We\n   anticipate that the network, through configuration or management\n \
    \  protocols, tells a mobile device what kind of location it finds\n   itself\
    \ in.  The device and associated software can then tailor its\n   behavior to\
    \ the environment.  For example, this document defines the\n   terms \"classroom\"\
    , \"place-of-worship\", and \"theater\".  A considerate\n   owner of a cell phone\
    \ might program the device to switch from ringer\n   to vibrate mode in such environments.\
    \  Just knowing the geographic\n   location, be it as civic (street address) or\
    \ geospatial coordinates,\n   would generally not allow the device to make a similar\
    \ decision.\n   Naturally, the number of descriptive terms for physical environments\n\
    \   is almost unbounded.  This registry tries to identify common terms\n   that\
    \ are likely to be useful for communications devices and for\n   controlling and\
    \ guiding communications behavior.  The terms roughly\n   correspond to the level\
    \ of details of location descriptions and icons\n   found on geographic maps,\
    \ for example, and are meant to be in common\n   use across a variety of cultures\
    \ and countries.  The registration\n   process described in the IANA Considerations\
    \ section allows this list\n   to be extended as needed, while aiming to prevent\
    \ an unnecessary\n   explosion in the registry.\n   The use of tokens (i.e., protocol\
    \ constants) makes it easier to build\n   systems across multiple languages. \
    \ A user interface can readily\n   translate a finite set of tokens to user-appropriate\
    \ textual or\n   iconic representations.  Protocols using this registry are encouraged\n\
    \   to provide additional mechanisms to accommodate location types not\n   currently\
    \ registered via free-text fields with appropriate language\n   and character\
    \ set labeling.\n   The terms defined in this registry do not attempt to provide\
    \ a\n   hierarchy of location descriptions, except in certain special cases.\n\
    \   For example, the term \"restaurant\" is defined to include the term\n   \"\
    cafe\", and the term \"public\" encompasses a range of descriptors, as\n   noted\
    \ below.  The registry makes these more generic terms available\n   as often the\
    \ more detailed distinctions may not be available, or\n   privacy concerns suggest\
    \ the use of less precise terms that are still\n   sufficient to guide communications\
    \ behavior or evaluate the source of\n   a phone call or message, say.\n   In\
    \ many cases, a location might be described by multiple terms that\n   apply at\
    \ the same time.  For example, the combination of \"restaurant\"\n   and \"airport\"\
    \ is immediately recognizable.  This registry makes no\n   attempt to limit the\
    \ number of terms that can be used to describe a\n   single place or to restrict\
    \ what combinations are allowed, given that\n   there are few combinations that\
    \ are physically impossible.  Common\n   sense is probably a better guide here;\
    \ the authors would not want to\n   rule out creative business models such as\
    \ combinations of \"parking\"\n   and \"restaurant\" or \"bar\" and \"hospital\"\
    .  The number of terms that\n   can be used within the same protocol element is\
    \ left to the protocol\n   description.\n   This document does not describe how\
    \ the values of the registry are to\n   be used, as this description is provided\
    \ by other documents.  For\n   example, [5] describes options for carrying civic\
    \ address\n   information, including the place type attributes listed in this\n\
    \   document, using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv4 and\n   DHCPv6).\
    \  A usage for Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service\n   (RADIUS) is described\
    \ in [6], where this information is conveyed from\n   the RADIUS client to the\
    \ RADIUS server.  Rich presence (RPID [4])\n   also utilizes the values of the\
    \ location types registry.\n"

    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].\n"

- title: 5.1.  Registering Tokens
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Registering Tokens\n   This document creates new IANA registries for location\
    \ types as\n   listed in Section 3, starting with 'aircraft' and finishing with\n\
    \   'watercraft'.\n   IANA will maintain this registry both in the form of an\
    \ XML schema\n   and a list of tokens, with the same content.\n   Following the\
    \ policies outline in RFC 2434 [2], new tokens are\n   assigned after Expert Review.\
    \  The Expert Reviewer will generally\n   consult the IETF GeoPRIV working group\
    \ mailing list or its designated\n   successor.  Updates or deletions of tokens\
    \ from the registration\n   follow the same procedures.\n   The expert review\
    \ should be guided by a few common sense\n   considerations.  For example, tokens\
    \ should not be specific to a\n   country, region, organization, or company; they\
    \ should be well-\n   defined and widely recognized.  The expert's support of\
    \ IANA will\n   include providing IANA with the new token(s) when the update is\n\
    \   provided only in the form of a schema, and providing IANA with the\n   new\
    \ schema element(s) when the update is provided only in the form of\n   a token.\n\
    \   To ensure widespread usability across protocols, tokens MUST follow\n   the\
    \ character set restrictions for XML Names [3].\n   Each registration must include\
    \ the name of the token and a brief\n   description similar to the ones offered\
    \ herein for the initial\n   registrations contained this document:\n   Token\
    \ Identifier:  Identifier of the token.\n   Description:  Brief description indicating\
    \ the meaning of the token,\n      including one or more examples where the term\
    \ encompasses several\n      more precise terms.\n   XML namespace:  Tokens MAY\
    \ be used as elements within other\n      appropriate XML documents.  Each token\
    \ lists the namespace it is\n      part of, typically urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:location-type:ext,\
    \ where\n      'ext' is the name of the extension.\n   Note that the usage of\
    \ these tokens is not limited to XML and the\n   'Token Identifier' is the XML\
    \ element content and not the XML element\n   name.\n"
