- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   BGP-4 Multiprotocol Extensions [BGP-MP] defines the format of two\
    \ BGP\n   attributes (MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI) that can be used to\n\
    \   announce and withdraw the announcement of reachability information.\n   This\
    \ document defines how compliant systems should make use of those\n   attributes\
    \ for the purpose of conveying IPv6 routing information.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The BGP-4 protocol [BGP-4] in particular, and path vector\
    \ routing\n   protocols in general, are mostly independent of the particular\n\
    \   Address Family for which the protocol is being used.\n   IPv6 falls under\
    \ the generic category of protocols for which BGP-4 is\n   suitable and, unless\
    \ stated otherwise in this document, the BGP-4\n   procedures to apply when using\
    \ BGP-4 to carry IPv6 reachability\n   information are those defined in [BGP-4]\
    \ and in subsequent documents\n   that extend or update the BGP-4 specification.\n\
    \   In terms of routing information, the most significant difference\n   between\
    \ IPv6 and IPv4 (for which BGP was originally designed) is the\n   fact that IPv6\
    \ introduces scoped unicast addresses and defines\n   particular situations when\
    \ a particular address scope must be used.\n   This document concerns itself essentially\
    \ with the necessary rules to\n   accommodate IPv6 address scope requirements.\n"
- title: 2. IPv6 Address Scopes
  contents:
  - "2. IPv6 Address Scopes\n   IPv6 defines 3 unicast address scopes [ADDR-ARCH]:\
    \ global, site-local\n   and link-local. Site-local addresses are non-link-local\
    \ address which\n   are valid within the scope of a \"site\" and cannot be exported\
    \ beyond\n   it. As this document makes no assumption on the characteristics of\
    \ a\n   particular routing realm where BGP-4 is used, it makes no distinction\n\
    \   between global and site-local addresses and refers to both as\n   \"global\"\
    \ or \"non-link-local\". Network administrators must however\n   respect address\
    \ scope restrictions and should be aware that the\n   concepts of a BGP-4 routing\
    \ domain and \"site\" are orthogonal notions\n   and that they may or may not\
    \ coincide in a given situation.\n   Companion IPv6 specifications further define\
    \ that only link-local\n   address can be used when generating ICMP Redirect Messages\
    \ [ND] and\n   as next hop addresses in some routing protocols (eg. RIPng [RIP]).\n\
    \   This restrictions does imply that an IPv6 router must have a link-\n   local\
    \ next hop address for all directly connected routes (routes for\n   which the\
    \ given router and the next hop router share a common subnet\n   prefix).\n  \
    \ Link-local addresses are not, however, well suited to be used as next\n   hop\
    \ attributes in BGP-4 given the rules defined for this attribute in\n   the protocol\
    \ specification [BGP-4].\n   For the above reasons, when BGP-4 is used to convey\
    \ IPv6 reachability\n   information it is sometimes necessary to announce a next\
    \ hop\n   attribute that consists of a global address and a link-local address.\n\
    \   The following section describes the rules that should be followed\n   when\
    \ constructing the Network Address of Next Hop field of an\n   MP_REACH_NLRI attribute.\n"
- title: 3. Constructing the Next Hop field
  contents:
  - "3. Constructing the Next Hop field\n   A BGP speaker shall advertise to its peer\
    \ in the Network Address of\n   Next Hop field the global IPv6 address of the\
    \ next hop, potentially\n   followed by the link-local IPv6 address of the next\
    \ hop.\n   The value of the Length of Next Hop Network Address field on a\n  \
    \ MP_REACH_NLRI attribute shall be set to 16, when only a global\n   address is\
    \ present, or 32 if a link-local address is also included in\n   the Next Hop\
    \ field.\n   The link-local address shall be included in the Next Hop field if\
    \ and\n   only if the BGP speaker shares a common subnet with the entity\n   identified\
    \ by the global IPv6 address carried in the Network Address\n   of Next Hop field\
    \ and the peer the route is being advertised to.\n   In all other cases a BGP\
    \ speaker shall advertise to its peer in the\n   Network Address field only the\
    \ global IPv6 address of the next hop\n   (the value of the Length of Network\
    \ Address of Next Hop field shall\n   be set to 16).\n   As a consequence, a BGP\
    \ speaker that advertises a route to an\n   internal peer may modify the Network\
    \ Address of Next Hop field by\n   removing the link-local IPv6 address of the\
    \ next hop.\n"
- title: 4. Transport
  contents:
  - "4. Transport\n   TCP connections, on top of which BGP-4 messages are exchanged,\
    \ can be\n   established either over IPv4 or IPv6. While BGP-4 itself is\n   independent\
    \ of the particular transport used it derives implicit\n   configuration information\
    \ from the address used to establish the\n   peering session.  This information\
    \ (the network address of a peer) is\n   taken in account in the route dissemination\
    \ procedure. Thus, when\n   using TCP over IPv4 as a transport for IPv6 reachability\
    \ information,\n   additional explicit configuration of the peer's network address\
    \ is\n   required.\n   Note that the information referred above is distinct from\
    \ the BGP\n   Identifier used in the BGP-4 tie breaking procedure. The BGP\n \
    \  Identifier is a 32 bit unsigned integer exchanged between two peers\n   at\
    \ session establishment time, within an OPEN message. This is a\n   system wide\
    \ value determined at startup which must be unique in the\n   network and should\
    \ be derived from an IPv4 address regardless of the\n   network protocol(s) a\
    \ particular BGP-4 instance is configured to\n   convey at a given moment.\n \
    \  The use of TCP over IPv6 as transport protocol for IPv6 reachability\n   information\
    \ also has the advantage of providing explicit confirmation\n   of IPv6 network\
    \ reachability between two peers.\n"
- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   The extensions defined in this document allow\
    \ BGP to propagate\n   reachability information about IPv6 routes. As such, no\
    \ new security\n   issues are raised beyond those that already exist in BGP-4\
    \ and its\n   use with IPv4.\n"
