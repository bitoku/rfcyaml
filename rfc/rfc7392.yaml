  - "1.  Introduction\n   Procedures for dynamically establishing Multi-Segment Pseudowires\n\
    \   (MS-PWs), where their paths are automatically determined using a\n   dynamic\
    \ routing protocol, are defined in [RFC7267].  For 1:1\n   protection of MS-PWs\
    \ with primary and backup paths, MS-PWs need to be\n   established through a diverse\
    \ set of Switching Provider Edges (S-PEs)\n   to avoid any single points of failure\
    \ at the PW level.  [RFC7267]\n   allows this through BGP-based mechanisms.  This\
    \ document defines an\n   additional mechanism that allows Source Terminating\
    \ Provider Edges\n   (ST-PEs) to explicitly choose the path that a PW would take\
    \ through\n   the intervening S-PEs.  Explicit path routing of dynamic MS-PWs\
    \ may\n   also be required for controlled setup of dynamic MS-PWs and network\n\
    \   resource management.\n   Note that in many deployments the ST-PE will not\
    \ have a view of the\n   topology of S-PEs and so the explicit route will need\
    \ to be supplied\n   from a management application.  How that management application\n\
    \   determines the explicit route is outside the scope of this document.\n"

    \ signaling, but has not been assigned an S-PE address, and that\n   receives\

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Next-Hop Selection\n   A PW Label Mapping message containing an Explicit\
    \ Route TLV specifies\n   the next hop for a given MS-PW path.  Selection of this\
    \ next hop by\n   the ST-PE or S-PE inserting the ER-Hop TLV may involve a selection\n\
    \   from a set of possible alternatives.  The mechanism for making a\n   selection\
    \ from this set is implementation specific and is outside the\n   scope of this\
    \ document.  The mechanism used to select a particular\n   path is also outside\
    \ the scope of this document, but each node MUST\n   determine a loop-free path\
    \ if it is to signal the MS-PW.  [RFC6073],\n   Section 7.6 provides a mechanism\
    \ by which a node can check that the\n   path taken by an MS-PW does not include\
    \ loops.\n   As noted in Section 1, in many deployments the ST-PE will not have\
    \ a\n   view of the topology of S-PEs and so the path will need to be\n   supplied\
    \ from a management application.\n   If a loop-free path cannot be found by an\
    \ ST-PE or S-PE, then a node\n   MUST NOT attempt to signal the MS-PW.  For an\
    \ S-PE, if it cannot\n   determine a loop-free path, then the received Label Mapping\
    \ message\n   MUST be released with a status code of \"PW Loop Detected\" as per\n\
    \   Section 4.2.3 of [RFC7267].\n   To determine the next hop for the MS-PW path,\
    \ a node performs the\n   following steps.  Note that these procedures assume\
    \ that a valid S-PE\n   address has been assigned to the node, as per Section\
    \ 3.1, above.\n   1.  The node receiving the Label Mapping message that contains\
    \ an\n       ER-TLV MUST evaluate the first ER-Hop.  If the L bit is not set\n\
    \       in the first ER-Hop and if the node is not part of the abstract\n    \
    \   node described by the first ER-Hop (i.e., it does not lie within\n       the\
    \ prefix as determined by the prefix length specified in the\n       ER-Hop TLV),\
    \ it has received the message in error.  Therefore,\n       the node MUST reply\
    \ with a Label Release message with a \"Bad\n       Initial ER-Hop Error\" (0x04000004)\
    \ status code.  If the L bit is\n       set and the local node is not part of\
    \ the abstract node described\n       by the first ER-Hop, the node selects a\
    \ next hop that is along\n       the path to the abstract node described by the\
    \ first ER-Hop.  If\n       there is no ER-Hop TLV contained in the ER-TLV, the\
    \ message is\n       also in error, and the node SHOULD return a \"Bad Explicit\
    \ Routing\n       TLV Error\" (0x04000001) status code in a Label Release message\n\
    \       sent to the upstream node.  Note that this statement does not\n      \
    \ preclude a Label Mapping message with no ER-TLV.  If a Label\n       Mapping\
    \ message with no ER-TLV is received, then it MUST be\n       processed as per\
    \ [RFC7267].\n   2.  If there are no further ER-Hop TLVs following the first ER-Hop\n\
    \       TLV, this indicates the end of the explicit route.  The Explicit\n   \
    \    Route TLV MUST be removed from the Label Mapping message.  This\n       node\
    \ may or may not be the end of the PW.  Processing continues\n       as per Section\
    \ 4.2, where a new Explicit Route TLV MAY be added\n       to the Label Mapping\
    \ message.\n   3.  If a second ER-Hop TLV does exist, and the node is also a part\
    \ of\n       the abstract node described by the second ER-Hop, then the node\n\
    \       deletes the first ER-Hop and continues processing with step 2,\n     \
    \  above.  Note that this makes the second ER-Hop into the first\n       ER-Hop\
    \ for the iteration for the next PW segment.\n   4.  The node determines if it\
    \ is topologically adjacent to the\n       abstract node described by the second\
    \ ER-Hop.  That is, it is\n       directly connected to the next node by a PW\
    \ control-plane\n       adjacency.  If so, the node selects a particular next\
    \ hop that is\n       a member of the abstract node.  The node then deletes the\
    \ first\n       ER-Hop and continues processing as per Section 4.2, below.\n \
    \  5.  Next, the node selects a next hop within the abstract node of the\n   \
    \    first ER-Hop that is along the path to the abstract node of the\n       second\
    \ ER-Hop.  If no such path exists, then there are two cases:\n       A.  If the\
    \ second ER-Hop is a strict ER Hop, then there is an\n           error, and the\
    \ node MUST return a Label Release message to\n           the upstream node with\
    \ a \"Bad Strict Node Error\" (0x04000002)\n           status code.\n       B.\
    \  Otherwise, if the second ER-Hop is a loose ER Hop, then the\n           node\
    \ selects any next hop that is along the path to the next\n           abstract\
    \ node.  If no path exists within the MPLS domain,\n           then there is an\
    \ error, and the node MUST return a Label\n           Release message to the upstream\
    \ node with a \"Bad Loose Node\n           Error\" (0x04000003) status code.\n\
    \   6.  Finally, the node replaces the first ER-Hop with any ER Hop that\n   \
    \    denotes an abstract node containing the next hop.  This is\n       necessary\
    \ so that when the explicit route is received by the next\n       hop, it will\
    \ be accepted.\n   7.  Progress the Label Mapping message to the next hop.\n"
