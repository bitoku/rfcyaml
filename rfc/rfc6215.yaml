- title: 1.1.  Updates to the MPLS-TP UNI and NNI
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Updates to the MPLS-TP UNI and NNI\n   The Transport Service Interfaces\
    \ for MPLS-TP are defined in Section\n   3.4.3 of [RFC5921].  These definitions\
    \ are illustrated by showing\n   MPLS-TP Provider Edges (PEs) containing a UNI\
    \ and an NNI.  The\n   figures illustrate the UNI and the NNI as a span.  However,\
    \ it is\n   convention to illustrate these interfaces as reference points.\n \
    \  Furthermore, in the case of a UNI, it is useful to illustrate the\n   distribution\
    \ of UNI functions between the Customer Edge (CE) side and\n   the PE side of\
    \ the UNI, i.e., the UNI-C (User-to-User Interface,\n   Client side) and UNI-N\
    \ (User-to-Network Interface, Network side), in\n   order to show their relationship\
    \ to one another.\n   This document provides updated illustrations of the MPLS-TP\
    \ UNI and\n   MPLS-TP NNI to show these additional details.  These illustrations\n\
    \   obsolete the corresponding ones in [RFC5921].  This document also\n   defines\
    \ additional terminology referenced in the illustrations.  No\n   other updates\
    \ are made by this document.\n   Awareness of the Transport Service layer need\
    \ exist only at PE nodes,\n   and so only these nodes are illustrated in the figures.\
    \  MPLS-TP\n   Provider (P) nodes need have no awareness of this layer.  Both\
    \ PE and\n   P nodes participate in the Transport Path layer.  A PE terminates\n\
    \   (i.e., is a Label Edge Router (LER) with respect to) the transport\n   paths\
    \ it supports, and is responsible for multiplexing and\n   demultiplexing of Transport\
    \ Service Instance traffic over such\n   transport paths.\n"
