    \ that need to be configured and monitored in a\n   standard way.\n   The \"ietf-system\"\
    \ YANG module defined in this document provides the\n   following features:\n\
    \   o  configuration and monitoring of system identification\n   o  configuration\
    \ and monitoring of system time-of-day\n   o  configuration of user authentication\n\

- title: 2.1.  System Identification
  contents:
  - "2.1.  System Identification\n   There are many common properties used to identify\
    \ devices, operating\n   systems, software versions, etc. that need to be supported\
    \ in the\n   system data module.  These objects are defined as operational state\n\
    \   data, and the information returned by the server is intended to be\n   specific\
    \ to the device vendor.\n   Some user-configurable administrative strings are\
    \ also provided, such\n   as the system location and description.\n"
- title: 2.2.  System Time Management
  contents:
  - "2.2.  System Time Management\n   Management of the date and time used by the\
    \ system needs to be\n   supported.  The use of one or more NTP servers to automatically\
    \ set\n   the system date and time needs to be possible.  Utilization of the\n\
    \   Time Zone Database [RFC6557] also needs to be supported.  It should\n   be\
    \ possible to configure the system to use NTP.\n"
- title: 2.3.  User Authentication
  contents:
  - "2.3.  User Authentication\n   The authentication mechanism needs to support password\
    \ authentication\n   over RADIUS in order to support deployment scenarios with\
    \ centralized\n   authentication servers.  Additionally, for scenarios when no\n\
    \   centralized authentication server exists or for situations where the\n   centralized\
    \ authentication server cannot be reached from the device,\n   local users need\
    \ to be supported.\n   Since the mandatory transport protocol for NETCONF is Secure\
    \ Shell\n   (SSH) [RFC6242], the authentication model needs to support SSH's\n\
    \   \"publickey\" and \"password\" authentication methods [RFC4252].\n   The model\
    \ for authentication configuration should be flexible enough\n   to support authentication\
    \ methods defined by other standards\n   documents or by vendors.  It should be\
    \ possible to configure the\n   system authentication properties.\n"
- title: 2.4.  DNS Resolver
  contents:
  - "2.4.  DNS Resolver\n   The configuration of the DNS resolver within the system\
    \ containing\n   the NETCONF server is required in order to control how domain\
    \ names\n   are resolved.\n"
- title: 2.5.  System Control
  contents:
  - "2.5.  System Control\n   A few operations are needed to support common tasks\
    \ such as\n   restarting the device or setting the system date and time.\n"

    \       $<id>$<salt>$<password hash>\n            $<id>$<parameter>$<salt>$<password\
    \ hash>\n          The '$0$' prefix signals that the value is clear text.  When\n\
    \          such a value is received by the server, a hash value is\n         \
    \ calculated, and the string '$<id>$<salt>$' or\n          $<id>$<parameter>$<salt>$\

    \ the stored password hash string for that user, extracts\n          the salt,\
    \ and calculates the hash with the salt and given\n          password as input.\
    \  If the calculated hash value is the same\n          as the stored value, the\
    \ password given by the client is\n          accepted.\n          This type defines\

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   The YANG modules defined in this memo are designed\
    \ to be accessed via\n   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer\
    \ is the\n   secure transport layer and the mandatory to implement secure\n  \
    \ transport is SSH [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control model\n   [RFC6536]\
    \ provides the means to restrict access for particular\n   NETCONF users to a\
    \ pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF\n   protocol operations and content.\n\
    \   There are a number of data nodes defined in the \"ietf-system\" YANG\n   module\
    \ which are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true,\n   which is the\
    \ default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive\n   or vulnerable in\
    \ some network environments.  Write operations (e.g.,\n   edit-config) to these\
    \ data nodes without proper protection can have a\n   negative effect on network\
    \ operations.  These are the subtrees and\n   data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:\n\
    \   o  /system/clock/timezone: This choice contains the objects used to\n    \
    \  control the time zone used by the device.\n   o  /system/ntp: This container\
    \ contains the objects used to control\n      the Network Time Protocol servers\
    \ used by the device.\n   o  /system/dns-resolver: This container contains the\
    \ objects used to\n      control the Domain Name System servers used by the device.\n\
    \   o  /system/radius: This container contains the objects used to\n      control\
    \ the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service servers\n      used by the device.\n\
    \   o  /system/authentication/user-authentication-order: This leaf\n      controls\
    \ how user login attempts are authenticated by the device.\n   o  /system/authentication/user:\
    \ This list contains the local users\n      enabled on the system.\n   Some of\
    \ the readable data nodes in the \"ietf-system\" YANG module may\n   be considered\
    \ sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.\n   It is thus important\
    \ to control read access (e.g., via get,\n   get-config or notification) to these\
    \ data nodes.  These are the\n   subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:\n\
    \   o  /system/platform: This container has objects that may help\n      identify\
    \ the specific NETCONF server and/or operating system\n      implementation used\
    \ on the device.\n   o  /system/authentication/user: This list has objects that\
    \ may help\n      identify the specific user names and password information in\
    \ use\n      on the device.\n   Some of the RPC operations in the \"ietf-system\"\
    \ YANG module may be\n   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.\
    \  It\n   is thus important to control access to these operations.  These are\n\
    \   the operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   o  set-current-datetime:\
    \ Changes the current date and time on the\n      device.\n   o  system-restart:\
    \ Reboots the device.\n   o  system-shutdown: Shuts down the device.\n   Since\
    \ this document describes the use of RADIUS for purposes of\n   authentication,\
    \ it is vulnerable to all of the threats that are\n   present in other RADIUS\
    \ applications.  For a discussion of such\n   threats, see [RFC2865] and [RFC3162],\
    \ and Section 4 of [RFC3579].\n   This document provides configuration parameters\
    \ for SSH's \"publickey\"\n   and \"password\" authentication mechanisms.  Section\
    \ 9.4 of [RFC4251]\n   and Section 11 of [RFC4252] discuss security considerations\
    \ for these\n   mechanisms.\n   The \"iana-crypt-hash\" YANG module defines a\
    \ type \"crypt-hash\" that\n   can be used to store MD5 hashes.  [RFC6151] discusses\
    \ security\n   considerations for MD5.  The usage of MD5 is NOT RECOMMENDED.\n"
