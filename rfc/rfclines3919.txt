Abstract This memo defines additional (to those in RFC 2896) protocol identifier examples for IP version 6 and MPLS protocols.
These can be used to produce valid protocolDirTable INDEX encodings, as defined by the Remote Network Monitoring MIB (Management Information Base)
[RFC2021] and the RMON Protocol Identifier Reference [RFC2895].
This document contains additional (to those in RFC 2896) protocol identifier macros for well known protocols.
A conformant implementation of the RMON 2 MIB [RFC2021] can be accomplished without the use of these protocol identifiers, and accordingly, this document does not specify any IETF standard.
It is published to encourage better interoperability between RMON 2 agent implementations, by providing RMON related IPv6 and MPLS protocol information.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
This memo defines basic protocol identifiers for IP version 6 and MPLS protocols.
The "Remote Network Monitoring MIB Protocol Identifier Macros" [RFC2896], defines various protocol identifiers.
The syntax of the protocol identifier descriptor is defined in the RMON Protocol Identifier Reference [RFC2895].
The reader should be familiar with these documents.
The intent of this document is not to adapt each protocol identifier defined in the RFC 2895 and in the RFC 2896 to IP version 6, but to define protocol identifiers for IP version 6 protocols and for MPLS protocol.
Relationship to the Remote Network Monitoring
MIB RMON MIB implementations use protocol identifiers to describe unambiguous capabilities in protocolDirTable entries.
This section defines protocol identifiers for MPLS with unambiguous names to distinguish MPLS Unicast from MPLS Multicast.

IPv6 Protocols ip6 PROTOCOL IDENTIFIER PARAMETERS {} ATTRIBUTES {} DESCRIPTION "The protocol identifiers for the Internet Protocol, Version 6 [RFC2460].
" CHILDREN "Children of 'ip6' are selected by the value in the Protocol field (one octet), as defined in the PROTOCOL NUMBERS table within the Assigned Numbers Document.
The value of the Protocol field is encoded in an octet string as [ 0.0.0.a ], where 'a' is the protocol field.
Children of 'ip6' are encoded as [ 0.0.0.a ], and named as 'ip6 a' where 'a' is the protocol field value.
For example, a protocolDirID fragment value of: 0.0.0.1.0.0.0.41.0.0.0.58 defines an encapsulation of IPv6 ICMP (ether2.ip6.icmp6)
" ADDRESS FORMAT "16 octets of the IPv6 address, in network byte order.
Each ip packet contains two addresses, the source address and the destination address.
ether2.ip.ipip6.udp is a different protocolDirID than ether2.ip6.udp, as identified in the protocolDirTable.
As such, two different local protocol index values will be assigned by the agent.
E.g., (full INDEX values shown):
ADDRESS FORMAT "The 'ipip6' address format is the same as the IPv6 address format.
ether2.ip.ipip6.udp is a different protocolDirID than ether2.ip6.udp, as identified in the protocolDirTable.
As such, two different local protocol index values will be assigned by the agent.
E.g., (full INDEX values shown):
12.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.41.0.0.0.17.3.0.0.0 " REFERENCE "RFC 2473
[RFC2473] defines Generic Packet Tunneling in IPv6 Specification."
This document contains textual descriptions of well known networking protocols, not the definition of any networking behavior.
As such, no security considerations are raised by its publication.
