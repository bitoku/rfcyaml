  - "1.  Introduction and Overview\n   [RFC2831] defines how HTTP Digest Authentication\
    \ [RFC2617] can be\n   used as a Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)\
    \ [RFC4422]\n   mechanism for any protocol that has a SASL profile.  It was intended\n\
    \   both as an improvement over CRAM-MD5 [RFC2195] and as a convenient\n   way\
    \ to support a single authentication mechanism for web, email, the\n   Lightweight\
    \ Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), and other protocols.\n   While it can be argued\
    \ that it is an improvement over CRAM-MD5, many\n   implementors commented that\
    \ the additional complexity of DIGEST-MD5\n   makes it difficult to implement\
    \ fully and securely.\n   Below is an incomplete list of problems with the DIGEST-MD5\
    \ mechanism\n   as specified in [RFC2831]:\n   1.  The mechanism has too many\
    \ options and modes.  Some of them are\n       not well described and are not\
    \ widely implemented.  For example,\n       DIGEST-MD5 allows the \"qop\" directive\
    \ to contain multiple values,\n       but it also allows for multiple qop directives\
    \ to be specified.\n       The handling of multiple options is not specified,\
    \ which results\n       in minor interoperability problems.  Some implementations\n\
    \       amalgamate multiple qop values into one, while others treat\n       multiple\
    \ qops as an error.  Another example is the use of an\n       empty authorization\
    \ identity.  In SASL, an empty authorization\n       identity means that the client\
    \ is willing to authorize as the\n       authentication identity.  The document\
    \ is not clear on whether\n       the authzid must be omitted or if it can be\
    \ specified with an\n       empty value to convey this.  The requirement for backward\n\
    \       compatibility with HTTP Digest means that the situation is even\n    \
    \   worse.  For example, DIGEST-MD5 requires all usernames/passwords\n       that\
    \ can be entirely represented in the ISO-8859-1 charset to be\n       down converted\
    \ from UTF-8 [RFC3629] to ISO-8859-1 [ISO-8859-1].\n       Another example is\
    \ the use of quoted strings.  Handling of\n       characters that need escaping\
    \ is not properly described, and the\n       DIGEST-MD5 document has no examples\
    \ to demonstrate correct\n       behavior.\n   2.  The DIGEST-MD5 document uses\
    \ ABNF from RFC 822 [RFC0822], which\n       allows an extra construct and allows\
    \ for \"implied folding\n       whitespace\" to be inserted in many places.  The\
    \ difference from a\n       more common ABNF defined in [RFC5234] is confusing\
    \ for some\n       implementors.  As a result, many implementations do not accept\n\
    \       folding whitespace in many places where it is allowed.\n   3.  The DIGEST-MD5\
    \ document uses the concept of a \"realm\" to define a\n       collection of accounts.\
    \  A DIGEST-MD5 server can support one or\n       more realms.  The DIGEST-MD5\
    \ document does not provide any\n       guidance on how realms should be named\
    \ and, more importantly, how\n       they can be entered in User Interfaces (UIs).\
    \  As a result, many\n       DIGEST-MD5 clients have confusing UIs, do not allow\
    \ users to\n       enter a realm, and/or do not allow users to pick one of the\n\
    \       server-supported realms.\n   4.  Use of username in the inner hash is\
    \ problematic.  The inner hash\n       of DIGEST-MD5 is an MD5 hash of colon-separated\
    \ username, realm,\n       and password.  Implementations may choose to store\
    \ inner hashes\n       instead of clear text passwords.  This has some useful\n\
    \       properties, such as protection from compromise of authentication\n   \
    \    databases containing the same username and password on other\n       servers\
    \ if a server with the username and password is\n       compromised; however,\
    \ this is rarely done in practice.  First,\n       the inner hash is not compatible\
    \ with widely deployed Unix\n       password databases, and second, changing the\
    \ username would\n       invalidate the inner hash.\n   5.  Description of DES/3DES\
    \ [DES] and RC4 security layers are\n       inadequate to produce independently\
    \ developed interoperable\n       implementations.  In the DES/3DES case, this\
    \ is partly a problem\n       with existing DES APIs.\n   6.  DIGEST-MD5 outer\
    \ hash (the value of the \"response\" directive)\n       does not protect the\
    \ whole authentication exchange, which makes\n       the mechanism vulnerable\
    \ to \"man-in-the-middle\" (MITM) attacks,\n       such as modification of the\
    \ list of supported qops or ciphers.\n   7.  The following features are missing\
    \ from DIGEST-MD5, making it\n       insecure or unsuitable for use in protocols:\n\
    \       A.  Channel bindings [RFC5056].\n       B.  Hash agility (i.e., no easy\
    \ way to replace the MD5 hash\n           function with another one).\n      \
    \ C.  Support for SASLPrep [RFC4013] or any other type of Unicode\n          \
    \ character normalization of usernames and passwords.  The\n           original\
    \ DIGEST-MD5 document predates SASLPrep and does not\n           recommend any\
    \ Unicode character normalization.\n   8.  The cryptographic primitives in DIGEST-MD5\
    \ are not up to today's\n       standards, in particular:\n       A.  The MD5\
    \ hash is sufficiently weak to make a brute force\n           attack on DIGEST-MD5\
    \ easy with common hardware [RFC6151].\n       B.  The RC4 algorithm is prone\
    \ to attack when used as the\n           security layer without discarding the\
    \ initial key stream\n           output [RFC6229].\n       C.  The DES cipher\
    \ for the security layer is considered insecure\n           due to its small key\
    \ space [RFC3766].\n   Note that most of the problems listed above are already\
    \ present in\n   the HTTP Digest authentication mechanism.\n   Because DIGEST-MD5\
    \ is defined as an extensible mechanism, it is\n   possible to fix most of the\
    \ problems listed above.  However, this\n   would increase implementation complexity\
    \ of an already complex\n   mechanism even further, so the effort is not worth\
    \ the cost.  In\n   addition, an implementation of a \"fixed\" DIGEST-MD5 specification\n\
    \   would likely either not interoperate with any existing implementation\n  \
    \ of [RFC2831] or would be vulnerable to various downgrade attacks.\n   Note that\
    \ despite DIGEST-MD5 seeing some deployment on the Internet,\n   this specification\
    \ recommends obsoleting DIGEST-MD5 because DIGEST-\n   MD5, as implemented, is\
    \ not a reasonable candidate for further\n   standardization and should be deprecated\
    \ in favor of one or more new\n   password-based mechanisms currently being designed.\n\
    \   The Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) family\n  \
    \ of SASL mechanisms [RFC5802] has been developed to provide similar\n   features\
    \ as DIGEST-MD5 but with a better design.\n"
