  - "1.  REQUIREMENTS\n   There is substantial interest in establishing a new Directory\
    \ Service\n   on the Internet. In the short term, there is pressure to establish\n\
    \   two new services:\n   -  White Pages lookup of users;\n   -  Support for X.509\
    \ Authentication for a range of applications in\n      particular for Privacy\
    \ Enhanced mail [Lin89].\n   In the medium term, there are likely to be many requirements\
    \ for\n   Directory Services, including:\n   - General resource lookup, for information\
    \ ranging from committee\n     structures to bibliographic data;\n   - Support\
    \ of management of the Internet infrastructure, and\n     integration of configuration\
    \ information into the higher level\n     directory;\n   - Support of applications\
    \ on the Internet. For example:\n      o  Electronic distribution lists;\n   \
    \   o  Capability information on advanced user agents;\n      o  Location of files\
    \ and archive services.\n   - Support for Mail Handling Systems; Be they RFC-822\
    \ based or X.400\n     based (IETF MHS-DS WG), e.g.,:\n      o  Support for routing;\n\
    \      o  Info on User agent capabilities; essential for a usage of\n        \
    \ Multimedia mail like MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail\n         Extensions).\n\
    \   For the longer term, more sophisticated usages of X.500 are possible\n   extending\
    \ it into a useful and fast yellow pages service.\n"
- title: 2. SUMMARY OF SOLUTION
  contents:
  - "2. SUMMARY OF SOLUTION\n   In principle, the current Internet Domain Name System\
    \ (DNS) could be\n   used for many of these functions, with appropriate extensions.\n\
    \   However, it is suggested that a higher level of directory service is\n   needed.\
    \ It is proposed to establish an Internet Directory Service\n   based on X.500.\
    \  This provides appropriate functionality for the\n   services envisaged and\
    \ gives flexibility for future extension. This\n   extension could be achieved\
    \ either by tracking the evolution of the\n   OSI Standard or by work specific\
    \ to the Internet. In practice, it is\n   likely to be a mixture of both.\n  \
    \ By deploying X.500 in some form on the Internet, a truly global and\n   universal\
    \ Directory Service can be built that will provide Internet\n   users with fast\
    \ access to all kinds of data. The X.500 Directory\n   Service in this case may\
    \ range from a simple white pages service\n   (information on people and services)\
    \ to coupling various existing\n   databases and information repositories in a\
    \ universal way.\n   Currently, several different but cooperating X.500 Directory\
    \ Services\n   pilots are taking place on the Internet. These pilots form an\n\
    \   important base for experimenting with this new service. Starting with\n  \
    \ these pilots, with the X.500 products arriving on the market today,\n   and\
    \ given sufficient funding for the central services described in\n   this paper\
    \ an operational X.500 Directory Service can be deployed.\n   The final goal of\
    \ the strategy described in this paper is to deploy a\n   fully operational Directory\
    \ Service on the Internet, providing the\n   functions mentioned in the previous\
    \ section.\n"
- title: 3.  INFORMATION FRAMEWORK
  contents:
  - "3.  INFORMATION FRAMEWORK\n   The most critical aspect of the Directory Service\
    \ is to establish an\n   Internet Information Framework. When establishing a sophisticated\n\
    \   distributed directory with a coherent information framework, it\n   involves\
    \ substantial effort to map data onto this framework. This\n   effort is an operational\
    \ effort and far outweighs the technical\n   effort of establishing servers and\
    \ user agents.\n"
- title: 3.1   The Technical Model
  contents:
  - "3.1   The Technical Model\n   By choosing the X.500 model as a basis for the\
    \ information framework,\n   it will also be part of a (future) global information\
    \ framework. The\n   key aspects of this model are:\n   - A hierarchical navigational\
    \ system that couples distributed\n     databases (of various kinds), which allows\
    \ for management of the\n     data by the organization/person responsible for\
    \ the data;\n   - Each object in this information structure (called the Directory\n\
    \     Information Tree, DIT) is represented as an entry;\n   - Objects are typed\
    \ by an \"object class\", which permits multiple\n     inheritance;\n   - An object\
    \ is described by a set of attributes;\n   - Each attribute is typed. Attribute\
    \ types are hierarchical;\n   - Each attribute type has an associated attribute\
    \ syntax, which may\n     be generic or shared with other attributes (e.g., Integer\
    \ Syntax;\n     Distinguished name Syntax); This allows for representation of\n\
    \     simple attributes (e.g., strings or bitmaps) or complex ones with\n    \
    \ detailed structures.\n   - Each entry has an unambiguous and unique global name;\n\
    \   - Alternate hierarchies may be built by use of aliases or pointers of\n  \
    \   distinguished name syntax.\n   This framework allows for representation of\
    \ basic objects such as\n   users within organizations. It is also highly extensible,\
    \ and so can\n   be used for a range of other applications.\n"
- title: 3.2   Extending the Technical Model
  contents:
  - "3.2   Extending the Technical Model\n   In the longer term, the model could be\
    \ extended to deal with a number\n   of other requirements which potentially must\
    \ be met by an Internet\n   Directory Service. Possible extensions include:\n\
    \   - Support of ordered attributes (needed by some applications such as\n   \
    \  message storage);\n   - Extensions to allow unification with management information,\n\
    \     associated with SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) [CFSD90]\n   \
    \  or other management protocols;\n   - Handling of non-hierarchical data in a\
    \ better manner for searching\n     and retrieval, whilst retaining the basic\
    \ hierarchy for management\n     purposes.  This is essentially building a general\
    \ purpose resource\n     location service on top of the basic infrastructure.\
    \ It will need\n     work on the information model, and not just the access protocols.\n\
    \   It is noted that although X.500 may not provide the ultimate solution\n  \
    \ to information retrieval, it has good potential for solving a lot of\n   information\
    \ service related problems.\n"
- title: 3.3   The Operational Model
  contents:
  - "3.3   The Operational Model\n   To make the Directory Service with a coherent\
    \ information framework\n   really operational requires a lot of effort. The most\
    \ probable\n   operational model is one where larger organizations on the Internet\n\
    \   maintain their part of the DIT on their own DSA (Directory System\n   Agent).\
    \ Smaller organizations will \"rent\" DSA space from regional\n   networks or\
    \ other service providers. Together these DSAs will form\n   the Internet Directory\
    \ Service Infrastructure. To couple the various\n   parts of the DIT that are\
    \ contained on these Internet DSAs, a special\n   DSA containing the Root for\
    \ the naming hierarchy within the DIT has\n   to be established and maintained.\n\
    \   The following tasks can be foreseen:\n   -  Defining the naming hierarchy;\
    \ See section 4.\n   -  Creating the Directory Infrastructure; See section 5.\n\
    \   -  Getting the Data into the directory; and\n   -  Managing the data in the\
    \ Directory. See section 6.\n"
- title: 4.  NAME ASSIGNMENT
  contents:
  - "4.  NAME ASSIGNMENT\n   In order to deploy the Internet Directory Service, it\
    \ is important to\n   define how the naming hierarchy will be structured. Although\
    \ the\n   basic model suggests a simple monolithic \"database\" containing all\
    \ of\n   the Internet's information infrastructure, with a namespace divided\n\
    \   along geographic boundaries, this may not be the definite model that\n   turns\
    \ out to be the most appropriate to the Internet. Different\n   models may evolve\
    \ according to the needs of the Internet and the\n   applications used on the\
    \ Internet (i.e., some parts of the DIT may be\n   assigned at the root for the\
    \ Internet). Below this one can envisage\n   several loosely coupled namespaces\
    \ each with their own area of\n   applicability. This should be handled as a part\
    \ of the general\n   operation of a directory service. An example of this might\
    \ be\n   assignment of a representation of the Domain Namespace under the root\n\
    \   of the DIT. This is further discussed in [BHK91a].\n   However, the core DIT\
    \ information will be nationally assigned. The\n   parts of the DIT below country\
    \ level will be managed differently in\n   each country. In many countries, registration\
    \ authorities will be\n   established according to the OSI Standard [ISO]. This\
    \ has been done\n   in some countries by the national ISO member body representative\
    \ (for\n   example in the UK by BSI).\n   The lower parts of the hierarchy will,\
    \ in general, be delegated to\n   organizations who will have control over Name\
    \ Assignment in that part\n   of the tree. There is no reason to mandate how to\
    \ assign this\n   hierarchy, although it is appropriate to give guidelines. Proposed\n\
    \   solutions to assignment of namespace are given in [BHK92].\n   In North America,\
    \ there is an alternative approach being developed by\n   the North American Directory\
    \ Forum (NADF), which leverages existing\n   registration mechanisms [For91].\
    \ It is not yet clear what form a\n   final North American Directory Service will\
    \ take. It is expected that\n   similar initiatives will be taken in other places,\
    \ such as Europe.\n   For the Internet, the Internet Society (ISOC) has been suggested\
    \ as a\n   possible Naming Authority.\n   A discussion of the main issues involved\
    \ with representing the Real\n   World in the Directory Service is part of the\
    \ work undertaken by the\n   IETF OSI DS Working Group.\n   The core of the Internet\
    \ Directory will therefore come to exist of a\n   country based structure with\
    \ different national naming schemes below\n   the countries.  It is clearly desirable\
    \ that the Internet Directory\n   Service follows any evolving national and international\
    \ hierarchies.\n   However, this should not be allowed to cause undue delay. The\n\
    \   strategy proposed is to proceed with name assignment as needed, and\n   to\
    \ establish interim registration authorities where necessary, taking\n   practical\
    \ steps to be aligned with emerging national authorities\n   wherever possible.\n\
    \   It is suggested that the Internet Directory Service does two things:\n   First,\
    \ each national part of the Internet DIT namespace should be\n   delegated to\
    \ an appropriate organization, which will usually be in\n   the country of question.\
    \  Second, the delegated organization should\n   assign names for that country\
    \ as part of the Internet Directory\n   Service. This should be done in a manner\
    \ which is appropriately\n   aligned with any emerging local or national service,\
    \ but does not\n   unduly delay the deployment of the Internet Directory Service.\
    \  For\n   most countries, this will fit in as a natural evolution of the early\n\
    \   directory piloting, where operators of pilots have acted as interim\n   name\
    \ registration authorities.\n"
- title: 5.  DIRECTORY INFRASTRUCTURE

  - "5.  DIRECTORY INFRASTRUCTURE\n   To provide access to the Internet Directory\
    \ Service, an\n   infrastructure has to be built. Although the technical components\
    \ of\n   an X.500 infrastructure are clear: DSAs (that hold the actual data)\n\
    \   and DUAs (that allow users and applications to access the data), a\n   lot\
    \ more is needed for deployment of an Internet Directory Service.\n   The Integrated\
    \ Directory Services (IDS) Working Group of the IETF is\n   playing a key role\
    \ in solving most of the issues that are related to\n   the building of an appropriate\

- title: 5.1   Short Term Requirements
  contents:
  - "5.1   Short Term Requirements\n   -  Central Operations. There is a need for\
    \ a number of operations\n      to be managed as a service for the whole Internet.\
    \ These services\n      are:\n      o A root DSA; containing the top-level of\
    \ the DIT, has to be\n        provided.  Currently, this root DSA is managed by\
    \ the Paradise\n        project.\n      o Name assignment; Inserting names into\
    \ the Directory, this has\n        been discussed in section 4. This could be\
    \ done in conjunction\n        with the appropriate Registration Authority or\
    \ by the\n        Registration Authority.  In most cases it is likely to be the\n\
    \        former, and mechanisms will need to be set up to allow\n        organizations\
    \ to get their names installed into the directory,\n        either direct or through\
    \ the registration authority.\n      o Knowledge management; i.e., the information\
    \ on \"which DSA holds\n        what part of the DIT, and how can that DSA be\
    \ accessed\". DSAs\n        will be established by Organizations. There will be\
    \ a need to\n        centrally coordinate the management of the knowledge information\n\
    \        associated with these DSAs. This is likely to be coupled to the\n   \
    \     name assignment.\n      o Knowledge and Data replication; For the Directory\
    \ to perform\n        well, knowledge and data high up in the DIT must be\n  \
    \      significantly replicated. A service must be provided to make\n        replicated\
    \ information available to DSAs that need it.\n      It is suggested that for\
    \ the time being, Paradise should be used\n      as the initial basis for handling\
    \ the top-level of the DIT and for\n      provision of the central services. However,\
    \ the services mentioned\n      above need to be provided at a national level\
    \ for every\n      participating country in the Internet Directory Service. Whenever\n\
    \      an organization starts a new country branch of the DIT in the\n      Internet\
    \ Directory Service the central operations will have to\n      help out to make\
    \ sure that these services will be properly\n      installed on a national level.\n\
    \   - An effective service will need to have sufficient implementations,\n   \
    \  in order to give full coverage over different hardware and software\n     platforms,\
    \ and to demonstrate openness. The recent Directory\n     Information Services\
    \ (pilot) Infrastructure Working Group's (DISI)\n     Survey of Directory Implementations\
    \ suggests that there will not be\n     a problem here.  This provides a list\
    \ of available X.500\n     implementations and their capabilities [LW91].\n  \
    \ - An executive summary, necessary to convince the management of\n     computer\
    \ centers to invest manpower into setting up a X.500\n     Directory Service.\
    \  This is provided by DISI [WR92].\n   - Due to the possible different and rather\
    \ independent structured\n     namespaces that can be envisaged in the DIT for\
    \ different purposes,\n     DUAs will have to be \"tuned intelligently\" for the\
    \ applications that\n     they are used for.\n   - To allow users easy access\
    \ to the Internet Directory Service even\n     from low powered workstations,\
    \ a lightweight protocol has to be\n     developed over TCP/IP. Already two private\
    \ protocols that do this\n     have been developed: The Michigan DIXIE protocol\
    \ [HSB91] and the PSI\n     Directory Assistance Service [Ros91]. The IETF OSI\
    \ Directory\n     Services Working Group (OSI-DS WG) is currently working on a\n\
    \     standard lightweight protocol called LDAP.\n   - Although the Internet Directory\
    \ Service does not have to make any\n     mandatory requirements about the use\
    \ of lower layers, it is noted\n     that the use of STD 35, RFC 1006 to allow\
    \ use of OSI applications on\n     top of TCP/IP is essential for deployment in\
    \ the Internet. Other\n     stacks like the ones using CLNS, CONS and X.25(80)\
    \ will probably\n     also be deployed in parts of the Internet. DSAs with different\n\
    \     stacks will be linked through use of either application level relays\n \
    \    (chaining) or Transport Service bridges.\n   - There are multiple issues\
    \ that are not dealt with (properly) in the\n     X.500 standard and thus prevent\
    \ the building of an Internet\n     Directory service.  Intermediate solutions\
    \ for these issues have to\n     be established in an \"open\" way. The results\
    \ will have to be\n     deployed as well as to be fed back into the relevant standard\n\
    \     committees. The IETF OSI-DS WG deals with these issues. Section 7\n    \
    \ describes several of these issues.\n   - Site support. The IETF IDS WG is looking\
    \ at providing the necessary\n     documentation to help with the provision of\
    \ support for Directory\n     users at participating sites.\n"

  - "6.  DATAMANAGEMENT\n   The whole of the Directory Infrastructure won't stand\
    \ much chance\n   without proper datamanagement of the data contained within the\
    \ DIT.\n   Procedures need to be established to assure a certain Level of\n  \
    \ Quality of the data contained in the DIT.\n   Due to the very nature of X.500,\
    \ the management of the data is\n   distributed over various sources. This has\
    \ the obvious advantage that\n   the data will be maintained by the owner of the\
    \ data. It does\n   however, make it quite impossible to describe one single procedure\n\
    \   for datamanagement.\n   For the Internet Directory Service, guidelines will\
    \ have to be\n   developed (by the IETF IDS WG), to help organizations that start\
    \ with\n   deployment of X.500 on how to manage data in their part of the DIT.\n\
    \   The guidelines should describe a minimum level of quality that has to\n  \
    \ be supplied to make the service operational. The IETF OSI-DS WG will\n   initiate\
    \ a pilot on Quality of Service parameters in the Directory,\n   that will be\
    \ of use.\n   Pilot datamanagement projects will have to be done (e.g., existing\n\

  - "7.  TECHNICAL ISSUES\n   The IETF has established the OSI-DS WG. The major component\
    \ of the\n   initial work of this group is to establish a technical framework\
    \ for\n   deploying a Directory Service on the Internet, making use of the\n \
    \  X.500 protocols and services [CCI88b].  This section describes the\n   work\
    \ already done by this working group, which has been implicitly\n   focused on\
    \ the technical infrastructure needed to deploy the Internet\n   Directory service.\n\
    \   The OSI Directory Standards do not yet contain sufficient specifics\n   to\
    \ enable the Internet Directory Service to be built. Full openness\n   and interoperability\
    \ are a key goal, so we may need Internet specific\n   agreements, at least until\
    \ the ISO standards are more complete. This\n   section notes areas where the\
    \ standards do not have sufficient\n   coverage, and indicates the RFCs which\
    \ have been written to overcome\n   these problems.\n   The work is being limited\
    \ to (reasonably well) understood issues.\n   This means that whilst we will attempt\
    \ to solve a wider range of\n   problems, not all potential requirements will\
    \ necessarily be met.\n   The technical work is done in conjunction with the RARE\
    \ WG on Network\n   Application Support WG (formerly RARE WG3). The IETF WGs and\
    \ the RARE\n   WG have a common technical mailing list. It is intended that this\n\
    \   will lead to a common European and North American technical approach.\n"
- title: 7.1   Schema
  contents:
  - "7.1   Schema\n   A Directory needs to be used in the context of an Information\n\
    \   Framework. The standard directory provides a number of a attributes\n   and\

    \ community will have requirements for additional attributes\n   and object classes.\
    \ There is a need to establish a mechanism to\n   register such information.\n\
    \   Pilots in the European RARE Community and the US PSI White Pages\n   Pilot\
    \ have based their information framework on the THORN and RARE\n   Naming Architecture.\

    \ and object classes, has\n   been released as RFC 1274 [BHK91a].\n"
- title: 7.2   Use on the Internet
  contents:
  - "7.2   Use on the Internet\n   It is a recognized policy on the Internet to deploy\
    \ OSI Applications\n   over non-OSI lower layers (such as STD 35, RFC 1006) [RC87].\
    \ This\n   policy allows deployment of OSI Applications before an OSI lower\n\
    \   layer infrastructure has been deployed. Thus, the Internet Directory\n   Service\
    \ will decouple deployment of the OSI Directory from deployment\n   of the OSI\
    \ lower layers. As the Internet Directory service will\n   extend into the far\
    \ corners of the Internet namespace, where the\n   underlying technology is not\
    \ always TCP/IP, the Internet Directory\n   Service will not make any mandatory\
    \ requirements about use of lower\n   layers. When configuring the Internet Directory\
    \ Services, variations\n   in the lower layers must be considered. The following\
    \ options are\n   possible:\n   - Operation on top of TCP/IP using a lightweight\
    \ protocol.\n   - Operation over TCP/IP using STD 35, RFC 1006. This is a practical\n\
    \     requirement of deployment at very many Internet sites, and is the\n    \
    \ basis of the existing services. It is highly recommended that all\n     participating\
    \ DSAs support this stack.\n   - Use of OSI Network Service (Connection Oriented\
    \ or Connectionless).\n   - X.25(80) will probably not be used in the core infrastructure\
    \ of\n     the Internet Directory Service, but is the basis of some European\n\
    \     activities.  It may be needed later to interconnect with US\n     commercial\
    \ systems not on the Internet. There will be a practical\n     need to interwork\
    \ with DSAs which only support this stack.\n   This approach has the following\
    \ implications:\n   1. There is a need to represent TCP/IP addresses within OSI\
    \ Network\n      Addresses. This is specified in RFC 1277 [HK91a].\n   2. It will\
    \ be desirable to have a uniform method to present Network\n      Addresses of\
    \ this style. Therefore, a string representation of\n      presentation addresses\
    \ is specified in RFC 1278 [HK91d].\n   3. This approach leads to the situation\
    \ where not all DSAs can\n      communicate directly due the different choice\
    \ of lower layers.\n      This is already a practical result of many European\
    \ sites operating\n      DSAs over X.25.  When the Internet Directory Service\
    \ is deployed,\n      the issue of which DSAs operate which stacks must be considered\
    \ in\n      order to achieve a coherent service.  In particular, there may be\
    \ a\n      need to require DSAs that serve parts higher up in the DIT to serve\n\
    \      multiple stacks. This will be tackled as an operational issue.\n   4. There\
    \ may be a requirement to extend the distributed operations, so\n      that there\
    \ is no requirement for full connectivity (i.e., each DSA\n      supports each\
    \ stack). A solution to this problem, by defining\n      \"relay DSAs\" is specified\
    \ in RFC 1276 [HK91b].\n"
- title: 7.3   Replication of Knowledge and Data
  contents:
  - "7.3   Replication of Knowledge and Data\n   There are a number of requirements\
    \ on replication, both of data (the\n   actual information on objects in the directory)\
    \ and knowledge (the\n   information on where do I find what data) information,\
    \ which must be\n   met before an Internet Directory can be deployed. The 1988\
    \ standard\n   cannot be used as is, because it does not deal with replication\
    \ or\n   caching. This leads to serious problems with performance. There is a\n\
    \   partial solution available in the 1992 version of the standard,\n   however\
    \ there are no products available yet that implement this\n   solution.  These\
    \ issues are discussed in more detail in RFC 1275\n   [HK91c].\n   As it took\
    \ too long for 1992 implementations to arrive to be of any\n   help to the already\
    \ rapidly growing pilot that urgently needed a\n   solution, an option was chosen\
    \ to use a simple interim approach as\n   defined in RFC 1276.  It will be clearly\
    \ emphasized that this is an\n   interim approach, which will be phased out as\
    \ soon as the appropriate\n   standards are available and stable implementations\
    \ are deployed. The\n   interim approach is based on the approach used in the\
    \ QUIPU\n   Implementation and it is widely deployed in the existing pilots.\n"
- title: 7.4   Presentation of Directory Names
  contents:
  - "7.4   Presentation of Directory Names\n   The standard does not specify a means\
    \ to present directory names to\n   the user. This is seen as a serious deficiency,\
    \ and a standard for\n   presenting directory names is required. For Distinguished\
    \ Names, a\n   string representation is defined in [HK92a]. However, as the\n\
    \   distinguished name is not very friendly for the user, a more user\n   oriented\
    \ specification of a standard format for representing names,\n   and procedures\
    \ to resolve them is chosen on the Internet, and is\n   specified in [HK92b].\n"

  contents:
  - "7.5   DSA Naming and MD Structure\n   There are some critical issues related\
    \ to naming of DSAs and the\n   structure of Directory Management Domains. The\
    \ main issues are:\n   - It is hard to achieve very high replication of knowledge\n\
    \     information as this is very widely spread;\n   - There is a need to give\
    \ DSAs more reasonable names, which will\n     contain an indication on the role\

- title: 8. SECURITY
  contents:
  - "8. SECURITY\n   A Directory can be an important component in the overall provision\
    \ of\n   security in a distributed system environment, especially when\n   public-key\
    \ cryptographic technology is employed. The directory can\n   serve as a repository\
    \ for authentication information, which, in turn,\n   forms the basis of a number\
    \ of OSI Authentication Services (e.g.,\n   X.400) and non-OSI Services (e.g.,\
    \ privacy-enhanced mail, PEM). The\n   directory may also use this and other stored\
    \ authentication\n   information to provide a wide range of security Services\
    \ used by the\n   Directory system itself.\n"
- title: 8.1   Directory Provision of Authentication
  contents:
  - "8.1   Directory Provision of Authentication\n   The directory will be used to\
    \ provide X.509 strong authentication.\n   This places minimal requirements on\
    \ the directory. To use this\n   infrastructure, users of authentication services\
    \ must have access to\n   the directory. In practice, this type of authentication\
    \ can be\n   deployed only on a limited scale without use of a directory, and\
    \ so\n   this provision is critical for applications such as Privacy Enhanced\n\
    \   Mail [Lin93]. The PEM development is considering issues relating to\n   deploying\
    \ Certification Authorities, and this discussion is not\n   duplicated here.\n\
    \   PEM defines a key management architecture based on the use of\n   public-key\
    \ certificates, in support of the message encipherment and\n   authentication\
    \ procedures defined in [Lin93]. The PEM certificate\n   management design [Ken93]\
    \ makes use of the authentication framework\n   defined by X.509. In this framework,\
    \ as adopted by PEM, a\n   \"certification authority\" representing an organization\
    \ applies a\n   digital signature to a collection of data consisting of a user's\n\
    \   public component, various information that serves to identify the\n   user,\
    \ and the identity of the organization whose signature is\n   affixed.  This establishes\
    \ a binding between these user credentials,\n   the user's public component and\
    \ the organization which vouches for\n   this binding. The resulting, signed,\
    \ data item is called a\n   certificate. The organization identified as the certifying\
    \ authority\n   for the certificate is the \"issuer\" of that certificate. The\
    \ format\n   of the certificate is defined in X.509.\n   In signing the certificate,\
    \ the certification authority vouches for\n   the user's identification, in the\
    \ context specified by the identity\n   of the issuer. Various types of organization\
    \ may issue certificates,\n   including corporate, educational, professional,\
    \ or governmental\n   entities. Moreover, these issuers may operate under different\n\
    \   certification policies, so that not all certificates may be equally\n   credible\
    \ (i.e., some certificates may be more trustworthy as accurate\n   identifiers\
    \ of users, organizations, mailing lists, etc). The PEM\n   certificate management\
    \ design allows for this diversity of\n   certification policies, while ensuring\
    \ that any certificate can be\n   traced unambiguously to the policy under which\
    \ it was issued.\n   The digital signature is affixed on behalf of that organization\
    \ and\n   is in a form which can be recognized by all members of the privacy-\n\
    \   enhanced electronic mail community. This ability to universally\n   verify\
    \ any PEM certificate results because the PEM certification\n   design is a singly\
    \ rooted tree, in which the Internet Society acts as\n   the root. Once generated,\
    \ certificates can be stored in directory\n   servers, transmitted via unsecure\
    \ message exchanges, or distributed\n   via any other means that make certificates\
    \ easily accessible to\n   message originators, without regard for the security\
    \ of the\n   transmission medium.\n"
- title: 8.2   Directory Security
  contents:
  - "8.2   Directory Security\n   A number of security services are possible with\
    \ the directory:\n   Peer Authentication at Bind\n      Authentication (one or\
    \ two way) between DUA/DSA and DSA/DSA,\n      established during the bind operation.\
    \ This authentication may be\n      provided using simple passwords (not recommended),\
    \ one-way hashed\n      passwords (more secure), or via public key cryptography\
    \ (most\n      secure). The various authentication options are specified in\n\
    \      X.500(88), but most existent implementations implement only simple\n  \
    \    password authentication.\n   Per-operation Authentication and Integrity\n\
    \      This is usually used to identify the DUA originating an operation\n   \
    \   to the Directory (e.g., to authenticate prior to data\n      modification).\
    \ It may also be used to verify the identity of the\n      DSA which provided\
    \ data in a response to the user. In both\n      examples, the integrity of the\
    \ data also is ensured through the\n      use of digital signatures. This is specified\
    \ in X.500(88), but not\n      yet widely implemented.\n   Single Entry Access\
    \ Control\n      This is used to control which users (DUAs) can access and modify\n\
    \      data within an entry. This is specified in X.500(92) and most DSA\n   \
    \   implementations provide this function.\n   Multiple Entry Access Control\n\
    \      This is used to control search and list operations, in order to\n     \
    \ allow location of information by searching, but to deter\n      \"trawling\"\
    \ of information and organizational structure. Usually,\n      these access controls\
    \ are limited in their ability to prevent\n      trawling because of the conflicting\
    \ goal of allowing a certain\n      level of legitimate browsing in support of\
    \ \"white pages\"\n      functionality.\n   Service Authorization\n      This\
    \ allows DSAs to control service in a data independent manner,\n      based on\
    \ peer authentication. For example, one might prevent\n      students from making\
    \ non-local queries, while permitting such\n      queries by faculty and staff.\n\
    \   Security Policy\n      This term encompasses the security goals for which\
    \ data access\n      control, service authorization, and authentication mechanisms\
    \ are\n      used to implement. For example, a local security policy might\n \
    \     require that all directory database modifications employ strong\n      authentication\
    \ and originate from a computer at a known (local)\n      location.\n   Data Confidentiality\n\
    \      The directory does not include explicit features to protect the\n     \
    \ confidentiality of data while in transit (e.g., between a DUA and\n      DSA\
    \ or between DSAs). Instead, it is assured that lower layer\n      security protocols\
    \ or other local security facilities will be\n      employed to provide this security\
    \ service. Ongoing work on\n      adaptation of the Network Layer Security Protocol\
    \ (NLSP) is a\n      candidate for provision of this security service with directories.\n\
    \   There is no specification of any Internet-wide security policy for\n   directories,\
    \ nor are there currently any security mechanisms required\n   of all directories.\
    \ Deployment of a directory could be based on a\n   variety of policies:\n   -\
    \ Read only system, containing only public data and restricted to\n     local\
    \ modification.\n   - Use of X.509 authentication, and private access control\
    \ mechanisms\n     (this will not allow open access control management, but this\
    \ is not\n     seen as a fundamental problem).\n   It will be important to understand\
    \ if global Internet requirements\n   for minimum essential directory security\
    \ mechanisms will be required\n   to promote widespread use of directories. We\
    \ recommend that an\n   informational RFC be written to analyze this issue, with\
