- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document describes an extension to the OSPF protocol to reduce\n\
    \   periodic flooding of Link State Advertisements (LSAs) in stable\n   topologies.\n\
    \   Current OSPF behavior requires that all LSAs, except DoNotAge LSAs,\n   to\
    \ be refreshed every 30 minutes.  This document proposes to\n   generalize the\
    \ use of DoNotAge LSAs in order to reduce protocol\n   traffic in stable topologies.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The explosive growth of IP-based networks has placed focus\
    \ on the\n   scalability of Interior Gateway Protocols such as OSPF.  Networks\n\
    \   using OSPF are growing every day and will continue to expand to\n   accommodate\
    \ the demand for connections to the Internet or intranets.\n   Internet Service\
    \ Providers and users that have large networks have\n   noticed non-negligible\
    \ protocol traffic, even when their network\n   topologies were stable.\n   OSPF\
    \ requires every LSA to be refreshed every 1800 seconds or else\n   they will\
    \ expire when they reach 3600 seconds [1].\n   This document proposes to overcome\
    \ the LSA expiration by generalizing\n   the use of DoNotAge LSAs.  This technique\
    \ will facilitate OSPF\n   scaling by reducing OSPF traffic overhead in stable\
    \ topologies.\n"
- title: 2.  Changes in the Existing Implementation
  contents:
  - "2.  Changes in the Existing Implementation\n   This enhancement relies on the\
    \ implementation of the DoNotAge bit and\n   the Indication-LSA.  The details\
    \ of the implementation of the\n   DoNotAge bit and the Indication-LSA are specified\
    \ in \"Extending OSPF\n   to Support Demand Circuits\" [2].\n   Flooding-reduction-capable\
    \ routers will continue to send hellos to\n   their neighbors and keep aging their\
    \ self-originated LSAs in their\n   database.  However, these routers will flood\
    \ their self-originated\n   LSAs with the DoNotAge bit set.  Thus, self-originated\
    \ LSAs do not\n   have to be re-flooded every 30 minutes and the re-flooding interval\n\
    \   can be extended to the configured forced-flooding interval.  As in\n   normal\
    \ OSPF operation, any change in the contents of the LSA will\n   cause a reoriginated\
    \ LSA to be flooded with the DoNotAge bit set.\n   This will reduce protocol traffic\
    \ overhead while allowing changes to\n   be flooded immediately.\n   Flooding-reduction-capable\
    \ routers will flood received non-self-\n   originated LSAs with the DoNotAge\
    \ bit set on all normal or flooding-\n   reduction-only interfaces within the\
    \ LSA's flooding scope.  If an\n   interface is configured as both flooding-reduction-capable\
    \ and\n   Demand-Circuit, then the flooding is done if and only if the contents\n\
    \   of the LSA have changed.  This allows LSA flooding for unchanged LSAs\n  \
    \ to be periodically forced by the originating router.\n"
- title: 3.  Backward Compatibility
  contents:
  - "3.  Backward Compatibility\n   Routers supporting the demand circuit extensions\
    \ [2] will be able to\n   correctly process DoNotAge LSAs flooded by routers supporting\
    \ the\n   flooding reduction capability described herein.  These routers will\n\
    \   also suppress flooding DoNotAge LSAs on interfaces configured as\n   demand\
    \ circuits.  However, they will also flood DoNotAge LSAs on\n   interfaces that\
    \ are not configured as demand circuits.\n   When there are routers in the OSPF\
    \ routing domain, stub area, or NSSA\n   area, that do not support the demand\
    \ circuit extensions [2] then the\n   use of these flooding reduction capabilities\
    \ will be subject to the\n   demand circuit interoperability constraints articulated\
    \ in section\n   2.5 of \"Extending OSPF to Support Demand Circuits\" [2].  This\
    \ implies\n   that detection of an LSA, with the DC bit clear, will result in\
    \ the\n   re-origination of self-originated DoNotAge LSAs with the DoNotAge\n\
    \   clear and purging of non-self-originated DoNotAge LSAs.\n"

- title: A.  Configurable Parameters
  contents:
  - "A.  Configurable Parameters\n   This memo defines new configuration parameters\
    \ for the flooding\n   reduction feature.  The feature must be enabled by configuration\
    \ on a\n   router and is, by default, off.\n    flooding-reduction <all | list\
    \ of interfaces> Indicates that the\n       router has the flooding reduction\
    \ feature enabled.  By default,\n       this parameter applies to all interfaces\
    \ running under the OSPF\n       instance to which it applies.  The feature can\
    \ be enabled on a\n       subset of explicitly specified interfaces.\n    flooding-interval\
    \ <n minutes> Indicates the interval in minutes for\n       the periodic flooding\
    \ of self-originated LSAs.  By default, this\n       value is 30 minutes as per\
    \ [1].  The minimum value is also 30\n       minutes.  A value of infinity will\
    \ prevent re-flooding of self-\n       originated LSAs that have not changed.\n"
