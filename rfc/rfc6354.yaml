  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines a simple enhancement to RFC 2198 [RFC2198]\
    \ to\n   support RTP sessions with forward-shifted redundant encodings, i.e.,\n\
    \   redundant data sent before the corresponding primary data.\n   Forward-shifted\
    \ redundancy can be used to conceal losses of a large\n   number of consecutive\
    \ media frames (e.g., consecutive loss of seconds\n   of media).  Such capability\
    \ is highly desirable, especially in\n   wireless mobile communication environments\
    \ where the radio signal to\n   a mobile wireless media receiver can be temporarily\
    \ blocked by tall\n   buildings, mountains, tunnels, etc.  In other words, the\
    \ receiver\n   enters into a shadow of the radio coverage.  No new data will be\n\
    \   received when the receiver is in a shadow.\n   In some extreme cases, the\
    \ receiver may have to spend seconds or even\n   tens of seconds in a shadow.\
    \  The traditional backward-shifted\n   redundant encoding scheme (i.e., redundant\
    \ data is sent after the\n   primary data), as currently supported by RFC 2198\
    \ [RFC2198], does not\n   address such consecutive frame losses.\n   In contrast,\
    \ the forward-shifted redundancy scheme allows one to\n   apply effective anti-shadow\
    \ loss management at the receiver (as\n   illustrated in Appendix A), thus preventing\
    \ service interruptions\n   when a mobile receiver runs into such a shadow.\n\
    \   Anti-shadow loss concealment as described in this document can be\n   readily\
    \ applied to the streaming of pre-recorded media.  Because of\n   the need of\
    \ generating the forward-shifted anti-shadow redundant\n   stream, to apply anti-shadow\
    \ loss concealment to the streaming of\n   live media will require the insertion\
    \ of a delay equal to or greater\n   than the amount of forward-shifting at the\
    \ source of media.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Sending Redundant Data Inband vs. Out-of-Band
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Sending Redundant Data Inband vs. Out-of-Band\n   Regardless of the direction\
    \ of time shift (e.g., forward-shifting, or\n   backward-shifting as in RFC 2198)\
    \ or the encoding scheme (e.g.,\n   Forward Error Correction (FEC), or non-FEC),\
    \ there is always the\n   option of sending the redundant data and the primary\
    \ data either in\n   the same RTP session (i.e., inband) or in separate RTP sessions\n\
    \   (i.e., out-of-band).  There are pros and cons for either approach, as\n  \
    \ outlined below.\n   Inband Approach:\n   o  Pro: A single RTP session is faster\
    \ to set up and easier to\n      manage.\n   o  Pro: A single RTP session presents\
    \ a simpler problem for NAT/\n      firewall traversal.\n   o  Pro: Less overall\
    \ overhead -- one source of RTP/UDP/IP overhead.\n   o  Con: Lack of flexibility\
    \ -- difficult for middle boxes such as\n      gateways to add/remove the redundant\
    \ data.\n   o  Con: Need more specification -- special payload formats need to\
    \ be\n      defined to carry the redundant data inband.\n   Out-of-Band Approach:\n\
    \   o  Pro: Flexibility -- redundant data can be more easily added,\n      removed,\
    \ or replaced by a middle box such as a gateway.\n   o  Pro: Little or no specification\
    \ -- no new payload format is\n      needed.\n   o  Con: Multiple RTP sessions\
    \ may take longer to set up and may be\n      more complex to manage.\n   o  Con:\
    \ Multiple RTP sessions for NAT/firewall traversal are harder\n      to address.\n\
    \   o  Con: Bigger overall overhead -- more than one source of RTP/UDP/IP\n  \
    \    overhead.\n   It is noteworthy that the specification of inband payload formats,\
    \ as\n   described in this document and in RFC 2198, does not preclude a\n   deployment\
    \ from using the out-of-band approach.  Rather, it gives the\n   deployment the\
    \ choice to use whichever approach is deemed most\n   beneficial under a given\
    \ circumstance.\n"

- title: 3.  Allowing Forward-Shifted Redundant Data
  contents:
  - "3.  Allowing Forward-Shifted Redundant Data\n   In RFC 2198, the timestamp offset\
    \ in the additional header\n   corresponding to a redundant block is defined as\
    \ a 14-bit unsigned\n   offset of the timestamp relative to the timestamp given\
    \ in the RTP\n   header.  As stated in RFC 2198:\n      The use of an unsigned\
    \ offset implies that redundant data must be\n      sent after the primary data,\
    \ and is hence a time to be subtracted\n      from the current timestamp to determine\
    \ the timestamp of the data\n      for which this block is the redundancy.\n \
    \  This effectively prevents RFC 2198 from being used to support\n   forward-shifted\
    \ redundant blocks.\n   In order to support the use of forward-shifted redundant\
    \ blocks, the\n   media type \"fwdred\", which allows a parameter called \"forwardshift\"\
    ,\n   is introduced to indicate the capability of and willingness to use\n   forward-shifted\
    \ redundancy and the base value of timestamp forward-\n   shifting.  The base\
    \ value of \"forwardshift\" is an integer equal to or\n   greater than '0' in\
    \ RTP timestamp units.\n   In an RTP session that uses forward-shifted redundant\
    \ encodings, the\n   timestamp of a redundant block in a received RTP packet is\
    \ determined\n   as follows:\n      timestamp of redundant block = timestamp in\
    \ RTP header\n                          - timestamp offset in additional header\n\
    \                          + forward-shift base value\n   Note that generally,\
    \ in a forward-shifted session, the timestamp\n   offset in the additional header\
    \ is set to '0'.\n   The sender MUST NOT change the contents of a packet that\
    \ appears in a\n   forward-shifted stream when it is time to send it in the main\
    \ stream.\n"

    \ Description Protocol (SDP)\n   [RFC4566], which is commonly used to describe\
    \ RTP sessions.  When SDP\n   is used to specify sessions employing the forward-shifted\

    \ goes in SDP \"a=rtpmap\" as the\n      encoding name.\n   o  The required parameter\
    \ \"forwardshift\" goes in the SDP \"a=fmtp\"\n      attribute by copying it directly\
    \ from the media type string as\n      \"forwardshift=value\".\n   The following\

    \  Redundancy\n   (This Appendix is included for Informational purposes.)\n  \
    \ It is not unusual in a wireless mobile communication environment that\n   the\
    \ radio signal to a mobile wireless media receiver can be\n   temporarily blocked\
    \ by tall buildings, mountains, tunnels, etc. for a\n   period of time.  In other\
    \ words, the receiver enters into a shadow of\n   the radio coverage.  When the\
    \ receiver is in such a shadow, no new\n   data will be received.  In some extreme\
    \ cases, the receiver may have\n   to spend seconds or even tens of seconds in\
    \ such a shadow.\n   Without special design considerations to compensate for the\
    \ loss of\n   data due to shadowing, a mobile user may experience an unacceptable\n\
    \   level of service interruptions.  Traditional redundant encoding\n   schemes\
    \ (including RFC 2198 and most FEC schemes) are known to be\n   ineffective in\
    \ dealing with such losses of consecutive frames.\n   However, the employment\
    \ of forward-shifted redundancy, in combination\n   with the anti-shadow loss\
    \ concealment at the receiver, as described\n   here, can effectively prevent\
    \ service interruptions due to the effect\n   of shadowing.\n"
- title: A.1.  Sender-Side Operations
  contents:
  - "A.1.  Sender-Side Operations\n   For anti-shadow loss management, the RTP sender\
    \ simply adds a\n   forward-shifted redundant stream (called anti-shadow or AS\
    \ stream)\n   while transmitting the primary media stream.  The amount of forward-\n\
    \   shifting, which should remain constant for the duration of the\n   session,\
    \ will determine the maximal length of shadows that can be\n   completely concealed\
    \ at the receiver, as explained below.\n   Except for the fact that the redundant\
    \ stream is forward-shifted\n   relative to the primary stream (i.e., the redundant\
    \ data is sent\n   ahead of the corresponding primary data), the design decision\
    \ and\n   trade-offs on the quality, encoding, bandwidth overhead, etc. of the\n\
    \   redundant stream are not different from the traditional RTP payload\n   redundant\
    \ scheme.\n   The following diagram illustrates a segment of the transmission\n\
    \   sequence of a forward-shifted redundant RTP session, in which the AS\n   stream\
    \ is forward-shifted by 155 frames.  If, for simplicity here, we\n   assume that\

  - "A.2.1.  Normal-Mode Operation\n   In the normal mode, after receiving a new RTP\
    \ packet that contains\n   the primary data and forward-shifted AS data, the receiver\
    \ passes the\n   primary data directly to the appropriate media decoder for play-out\n\
    \   (a de-jittering buffer may be used before the play-out, but for\n   simplicity\
    \ we assume that none is used here), while the received AS\n   data is stored\
    \ in an anti-shadow buffer.\n   Moreover, data stored in the anti-shadow buffer\
    \ will be continuously\n   checked to determine whether it has expired.  If any\
    \ redundant data\n   in the anti-shadow buffer is found to have a timestamp older\
    \ (i.e.,\n   smaller) than that of the last primary frame passed to the media\n\
    \   decoder, it will be considered expired and be purged from the\n   anti-shadow\
    \ buffer.\n   The following example illustrates the operation of the anti-shadow\n\
    \   buffer in normal mode.  We use the same assumption as in Figure 1,\n   and\

    \      ...\n     Figure 3: Example of Anti-Shadow Buffer Operation in Normal Mode\n\
    \   Before the beginning of the session (t<0), the anti-shadow buffer\n   will\
    \ be empty.  When the first primary frame is received, the play-\n   out will\
    \ start immediately, and the first received AS frame is stored\n   in the anti-shadow\
    \ buffer.  With the arrival of more forward-shifted\n   redundant frames, the\
    \ anti-shadow buffer will gradually be filled up.\n   For the example shown in\
    \ Figure 3, after 3.08 seconds (the amount of\n   the forward-shifting minus one\
    \ frame) from the start of the session,\n   the anti-shadow buffer will be full,\
    \ holding exactly 3.1 seconds\n   worth of redundant data, with the oldest frame\
    \ corresponding to\n   t=3.1 sec and the youngest frame corresponding to t=6.18\
    \ sec.\n   It is not difficult to see that in normal mode, because of the\n  \
    \ continuous purge of expired frames and the addition of new frames,\n   the anti-shadow\
    \ buffer will always be full, holding the next\n   'forwardshift' amount of redundant\
    \ frames.\n"

  - "A.2.2.  Anti-Shadow-Mode Operation\n   When the receiver enters a shadow (or\
    \ any other conditions that\n   prevent the receiver from getting new media data),\
    \ the receiver\n   switches to the anti-shadow mode, in which it simply continues\
    \ the\n   play-out from the forward-shifted redundant data stored in the\n   anti-shadow\
    \ buffer.\n   For the example in Figure 3, if the receiver enters a shadow at\n\
    \   t=3120, it can continue the play-out by using the forward-shifted\n   redundant\
    \ frames (ts=260-414) from the anti-shadow buffer.  As long\n   as the receiver\
    \ can move out of the shadow by t=6240, there will be\n   no service interruption.\n\
    \   When the shadow condition ends (meaning new data starts to arrive\n   again),\
    \ the receiver immediately switches back to the normal mode of\n   operation,\
    \ playing out from newly arrived primary frames.  At the\n   same time, the arrival\
    \ of new AS frames will start to re-fill the\n   anti-shadow buffer.\n   However,\
    \ if the duration of the shadow is longer than the amount of\n   forward-shifting,\
    \ the receiver will run out of media frames from its\n   anti-shadow buffer. \
    \ At that point, service interruption will occur.\n"
