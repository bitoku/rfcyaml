  - "Abstract\n   This document provides an overview of a workshop held by the Internet\n\
    \   Architecture Board (IAB) on Internet Technology Adoption and\n   Transition\
    \ (ITAT).  The workshop was hosted by the University of\n   Cambridge on December\
    \ 4th and 5th of 2013 in Cambridge, UK.  The goal\n   of the workshop was to facilitate\
    \ adoption of Internet protocols,\n   through examination of a variety of economic\
    \ models, with particular\n   emphasis at the waist of the hourglass (e.g., the\
    \ middle of the\n   protocol stack).  This report summarizes contributions and\n\
    \   discussions.  As the topics were wide ranging, there is no single set\n  \
    \ of recommendations for IETF participants to pursue at this time.\n   Instead,\
    \ in the classic sense of early research, the workshop noted\n   areas that deserve\
    \ further exploration.\n   Note that this document is a report on the proceedings\
    \ of the\n   workshop.  The views and positions documented in this report are\n\

- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet is a complex ecosystem that encompasses all\
    \ aspects of\n   society.  At its heart is a protocol stack with an hourglass\
    \ shape,\n   and IP at its center.  Recent research points to possible\n   explanations\
    \ for the success of such a design and for the significant\n   challenges that\
    \ arise when trying to evolve or change its middle\n   section, e.g., as partially\
    \ evident in the difficulties encountered\n   by IPv6.  The workshop had a number\
    \ of other key examples to\n   consider, including the next generation of HTTP\
    \ and real time web-\n   browser communications (WebRTC).  The eventual success\
    \ of many if not\n   all of these protocols will largely depend on our understanding\
    \ of\n   not only what features and design principles contribute lasting\n   value,\
    \ but also how deployment strategies can succeed in unlocking\n   that value to\
    \ foster protocol adoption.  The latter is particularly\n   important in that\
    \ most if not all Internet protocols exhibit strong\n   externalities that create\
    \ strong barriers to adoption, especially in\n   the presence of a well-established\
    \ incumbent.  That is, factors\n   beyond the control of the end points (such\
    \ as middleboxes) can limit\n   deployment, sometimes by design.\n   The Internet\
    \ Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops\n   designed to consider\
    \ long-term issues and strategies for the\n   Internet, and to suggest future\
    \ directions for the Internet\n   architecture.  This long-term planning function\
    \ of the IAB is\n   complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed\
    \ by working\n   groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), under the\n\
    \   leadership of the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) and area\n  \
    \ directorates.\n   Taking into account [RFC5218] on what makes a protocol successful,\n\
    \   this workshop sought to explore how the complex interactions of\n   protocols'\
    \ design and deployment affect their success.  One of the\n   workshop's goals\
    \ was, therefore, to encourage discussions to develop\n   an understanding of\
    \ what makes protocol designs successful not only\n   in meeting initial design\
    \ goals but more importantly in their ability\n   to evolve as these goals and\
    \ the available technology change.\n   Another equally important goal was to develop\
    \ protocol deployment\n   strategies that ensure that new features can rapidly\
    \ gain enough of a\n   foothold to ultimately realize broad adoption.  Such strategies\
    \ must\n   be informed by both operational considerations and economic factors.\n\
    \   Participants in this workshop consisted of operators, researchers\n   from\
    \ the fields of computer science and economics, and engineers.\n   Contributions\
    \ were wide ranging.  As such, this report makes few\n   recommendations for the\
    \ IETF to consider.\n"

    \  At the end,\n   workshop participants reviewed potential follow-up items. \

    \ is\n   given at the end.\n   Section 2 reviews the motivations and existing\
    \ work, and Section 3\n   discusses the economics of protocol adoption.  Section\
    \ 4 covers\n   innovative models for protocol adoption.  Section 5 delves into\

- title: 2.  Motivations and Review of Existing Work
  contents:
  - "2.  Motivations and Review of Existing Work\n   Our workshop began with an introduction\
    \ that asks the question: is\n   the neck of the Internet hourglass closed for\
    \ business?  There are\n   numerous instances where progress has been slow, the\
    \ three biggest\n   that come to mind being IPv6 [RFC2480], the Stream Control\n\
    \   Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC4960], and DNS Security (DNSSEC)\n   [RFC4034].\
    \  The impact of DNSSEC is of particular interest, because\n   it is relied upon\
    \ for the delivery of other services, such as DNS-\n   Based Authentication of\
    \ Named Entities (DANE) [RFC6698], and it could\n   be used for application discovery\
    \ services through DNS (specifically\n   where security properties are part of\
    \ that discovery).  Thus,\n   slowdown at the neck of the glass can have an impact\
    \ closer to the\n   lip.\n   Even when one considers the classic neck of the hourglass\
    \ to be IP\n   and transport layers, it was suggested that the hourglass might\n\
    \   extend as high as the application layer.\n                          ______________________\n\

    \n                         HTTP(s) as the new neck?\n   This idea was rebutted\
    \ by the argument that protocols do continue to\n   evolve, that protocols like\
    \ SMTP and IMAP in the applications space\n   have continued to evolve, as has\
    \ the transport layer.\n   The workshop moved on to a review of RFC 5218, which\
    \ discusses\n   protocol success factors.  This work was presented in the IETF\
    \ 70\n   plenary and was the basis for this ongoing work.  There were two\n  \
    \ clear outcomes from the discussion.  The first was that the Internet\n   Architecture\
    \ Board should review and consider that document in the\n   context of evaluating\
    \ Birds of a Feather (BoF) session proposals at\n   the IETF, so that any working\
    \ group proposal is carefully crafted to\n   address a specific design space and\
    \ provide positive net value.\n   Another aspect was to continue work on tracking\
    \ the value-specific\n   works in terms of success, wild success, or failure.\
    \  On that last\n   point, failure remains difficult to judge, particularly at\
    \ the neck\n   of the hourglass.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Economics of Protocol Adoption\n   Several papers were presented that looked\
    \ at economic aspects of\n   protocol adoption.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  When can bundling help adoption of network technologies or\n      services?\n\
    \   Economics of bundling is a long-studied field, but not as applied to\n   protocols.\
    \  It is relevant to the IETF and inherent to two key\n   notions: layering and\
    \ \"mandatory to implement\".  Two current examples\n   include DANE atop DNSSEC\
    \ and WebRTC atop SCTP.  The workshop reviewed\n   a model [Weber13] that explores\
    \ how bundling of two technologies may\n   lead to increased or decreased adoption\
    \ of one or both.  This will\n   depend on a number of factors, including costs,\
    \ benefits, and\n   externalities associated with each technology.  (Simply put,\
    \ an\n   externality is an effect or use decision by one set of parties that\n\
    \   has either a positive or negative impact on others who did not have a\n  \
    \ choice or whose interests were not taken into account.)  Bundling of\n   capabilities\
    \ may provide positive value when individual capabilities\n   on their own do\
    \ not provide sufficient critical mass to propel\n   further adoption.  Specifically,\
    \ bundling can help when one\n   technology does not provide positive value until\
    \ critical mass of\n   deployment exists, and where a second technology has low\
    \ adoption\n   cost and immediate value and hence drives initial adoption until\n\
    \   enough of a user base exists to allow critical mass sufficient for\n   the\
    \ first technology to get positive value.  One question was what\n   happens where\
    \ one technology depends on the other.  That is directly\n   tied to \"mandatory\
    \ to implement\" discussions within the IETF.  That\n   is a matter for follow-on\
    \ work.  IETF participants can provide\n   researchers anecdotal experience to\
    \ help improve models in this area.\n"
- title: '3.2.  Internet Protocol Adoption: Learning from Bitcoin'
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Internet Protocol Adoption: Learning from Bitcoin\n   The workshop considered\
    \ an examination of protocol success factors in\n   the context of Bitcoin [Boehme13].\
    \  Here, there were any number of\n   barriers to success, including adverse press,\
    \ legal uncertainties,\n   glitches and breaches, previous failed attempts, and\
    \ speculative\n   attacks.  Bitcoin has thus far overcome these barriers thanks\
    \ to\n   several key factors:\n   o  First, there is a built-in reward system\
    \ for early adopters.\n      Participants are monetarily rewarded at an exponentially\
    \ declining\n      rate.\n   o  There exist exchanges or conversion mechanisms\
    \ to directly convert\n      Bitcoin to other currencies.\n   o  Finally, there\
    \ is some store of value in the currency itself,\n      e.g., people find intrinsic\
    \ value in it.\n   The first two of these factors may be transferable to other\n\
    \   approaches.  One key protocol success factor is direct benefit to the\n  \
    \ participant.  Another key protocol success factor is the ability to\n   interface\
    \ with other systems for mutual benefit.  In the context of\n   Bitcoin, there\
    \ has to be a way to exchange the coins for other\n   currencies.  The Internet\
    \ email system had simpler adaption\n   mechanisms to allow interchange with non-Internet\
    \ email systems; this\n   facilitated its success.  Another more simply stated\
    \ approach is \"IP\n   over everything\".\n   A key message from this presentation\
    \ is that if a protocol imposes\n   externalities or costs on other systems, find\
    \ a means to establish\n   incentives for those other players for implementation.\
    \  As it\n   happens, there is a limited example that is directly relevant to\
    \ the\n   IETF.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.3.  Long term strategy for a successful deployment of DNSSEC - on all\n   \
    \   levels\n   The workshop reviewed the approach Sweden's .SE registry has taken\
    \ to\n   improving deployment of DNSSEC [Lowinder13].  .SE has roughly 1.5\n \
    \  million domains.  IIS (<https://www.iis.se>) manages the ccTLD\n   (Country\
    \ Code Top Level Domain).  They made the decision to encourage\n   deployment\
    \ of DNSSEC within .SE.  They began by understanding what\n   the full ecosystem\
    \ looked like, who their stakeholders were, and the\n   financial, legal, and\
    \ technical aspects to deployment.  As they began\n   their rollout, they charged\
    \ extra for DNSSEC.  As they put it, this\n   didn't work very well.\n   They\
    \ went on to fund development of OpenDNSSEC to remove technical\n   barriers to\
    \ deployment at end sites, noting that tooling was lacking\n   in this area. \
    \ Even with this development, more tooling is necessary,\n   as they point out\
    \ a need for APIs between the signing zone and the\n   registrar.\n   To further\
    \ encourage deployment, the government of Sweden provided\n   financial incentives\
    \ to communities to see that their domains were\n   signed.  .SE further provided\
    \ an incentive to registrars to see that\n   their domains were signed.  In summary,\
    \ .SE examined all the players\n   and provided incentives for each to participate.\n\
    \   The workshop discussed whether or not this model could be applied to\n   other\
    \ domains.  .SE was in a position to effectively subsidize DNS\n   deployment\
    \ because of their ability to set prices.  This may be\n   appropriate for certain\
    \ other top-level domains, but it was pointed\n   out that the margins of other\
    \ domains do not allow for a cost\n   reduction to be passed on at this point\
    \ in time.\n"

  - "3.4.  Framework for analyzing feasibility of Internet protocols\n   One of the\
    \ goals of the workshop was to provide ways to determine\n   when work in the\

    \ approach that combines value net analysis,\n   deployment environment analysis,\
    \ and technical architecture analysis\n   that leads to feasibility and solution\
    \ analysis [Leva13].  This work\n   provided an alternative to RFC 5218 that had\

  - "4.1.  On the Complexity of Designed Systems (and its effect on protocol\n   \
    \   deployment)\n   The workshop reviewed a comparison between the hourglass model\
    \ and\n   what systems biologists might call the bow tie model [Meyer13].  The\n\
    \   crux of this comparison is that both rely on certain building blocks\n   to\
    \ accomplish a certain end.  In the case of our hourglass model, IP\n   sits notably\
    \ in the center, whereas in the case of systems biology,\n   adenosine triphosphate\
    \ (ATP) is the means by which all organisms\n   convert nutrients to usable energy,\
    \ and thus resides centrally within\n   the biological system.\n   The workshop\
    \ also examined the notion of \"robust yet fragile\", which\n   examines the balance\
    \ between the cost of implementing robust systems\n   versus their value.  That\
    \ is, highly efficient systems can prove\n   fragile in the face of failure or\
    \ may prove hard to evolve.\n   The key question asked during this presentation\
    \ was how we could\n   apply what has been learned in systems biology or what\
    \ do the\n   findings reduce to for engineers?  The answer was that more work\
    \ is\n   needed.  The discussion highlighted the complexity of the Internet in\n\
    \   terms of predicting network behavior.  As such, one promising area to\n  \
    \ examine may be that of network management.\n"

    \   The workshop considered how network protocol capabilities enable\n   certain\
    \ sorts of services that are beneficial to consumers and\n   service providers.\
    \  This model looks at smart data pricing (SDP) in\n   which some behavior is\
    \ desired and rewarded through a pricing model\n   [Sen13].  The example given\
    \ was use of time-dependent pricing (TDP)\n   and demonstrated how a service provider\
    \ was able to load shift\n   traffic to off-peak periods.  Explicit Congestion\
    \ Notification (ECN)\n   and RADIUS were used by the project alongside a simple\
    \ GUI.  This\n   sort of work may prove useful to service providers as caching\
    \ models\n   evolve over time.  The question within the room was how will protocol\n\
    \   developers consider these sorts of requirements.\n"
- title: 5.  Making Standards Better
  contents:
  - "5.  Making Standards Better\n   There were several papers that focused on how\
    \ standards are produced.\n"
- title: '5.1.  Standards: a love/hate relationship with patents'
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Standards: a love/hate relationship with patents\n   One of the biggest\
    \ barriers to deployment is that of the unseen\n   patent by the non-practicing\
    \ entity (NPE) [Lear13].  While this\n   problem is relatively well understood\
    \ by the industry, the discussion\n   looked at patents as a means to improve\
    \ interoperability.  Those who\n   hold patents have the ability to license them\
    \ in such a way that a\n   single approach towards standardization is the result\
    \ (e.g., they get\n   to decide the venue for their work).\n"
- title: '5.2.  Bridge Networking Research and Internet Standardization: Case'
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Bridge Networking Research and Internet Standardization: Case\n      Study\
    \ on Mobile Traffic Offloading and IPv6 Transition\n      Technologies\n   There\
    \ was a presentation and discussion about the gap between the\n   research community\
    \ and standards organizations.  Two cases were\n   examined: mobile offloading\
    \ and IPv6 transition technologies\n   [Ding13].  In the case of mobile offloading,\
    \ a mechanism was examined\n   that required understanding of both 3GPP (Third\
    \ Generation\n   Partnership Project) and IETF standards.  Resistance in both\n\
    \   organizations was encountered.  In the 3GPP, the problem was that the\n  \
    \ organization already had an offloading model in play.  In the IETF,\n   the\
    \ problem was a lack of understanding of the interdisciplinary\n   space.  The\
    \ researchers noted that in the case of the IETF, they may\n   have taken the\
    \ wrong tack by having jumped into the solution without\n   having fully explained\
    \ the problem they were trying to solve.  In the\n   case of IPv6 transition technologies,\
    \ researchers encountered a\n   crowded field and not much appetite for new transition\
    \ technologies.\n   The workshop discussed whether the standards arena is the\
    \ best venue\n   or measurement of success for researchers.  The IRTF is meant\
    \ to\n   bridge academic research and the IETF.  As we will discuss below,\n \
    \  several avenues for continued dialog are contemplated.\n"
- title: 5.3.  An Internet Architecture for the Challenged
  contents:
  - "5.3.  An Internet Architecture for the Challenged\n   The workshop engaged in\
    \ a very provocative discussion about whether\n   the existing Internet architecture\
    \ serves the broadest set of needs.\n   Three specific aspects were examined:\
    \ geographic, technical, and\n   socioeconomic.  Researchers presented an alternative\
    \ hourglass or\n   protocol architecture known as Lowest Common Denominator Networking\n\
    \   (LCDNet) that re-examines some of the base assumptions of the\n   existing\
    \ architecture, including its \"always on\" nature\n   [Sathiaseelan13].\n   The\
    \ workshop questioned many of the baseline assumptions of the\n   researchers.\
    \  In part, this may have been due to constrained\n   discussion time on the topic,\
    \ where a fuller explanation was\n   warranted.\n"
- title: 6.  Other Challenges and Approaches
  contents:
  - "6.  Other Challenges and Approaches\n   The workshop held a number of other discussions\
    \ about different\n   approaches to technology adoption.  We should highlight\
    \ that a number\n   of papers were submitted to the workshop on routing security,\
    \ two of\n   which were not possible to present.\n"
- title: '6.1.  Resilience of the commons: routing security'
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Resilience of the commons: routing security\n   The workshop discussed\
    \ a presentation on the tragedy of the commons\n   in the context of global inter-domain\
    \ routing [Robachevsky13].  The\n   \"Internet Commons\" is a collection of networks\
    \ that we depend on but\n   do not control.  The main threat to the commons in\
    \ the context of BGP\n   is routing pollution, or unwanted or unnecessary routing\
    \ entries.\n   The Internet Society has been working with service providers to\n\
    \   improve resiliency by driving a common understanding of both problem\n   and\
    \ solution space and by developing a shared view with regard to\n   risk and benefits,\
    \ with the idea being that there would be those who\n   would engage in reciprocal\
    \ cooperation with the hopes that others\n   would do similarly in order to break\
    \ the tragedy.\n   What was notable in discussion was that there was no magic\
    \ bullet to\n   addressing the resiliency issue, and that this was a matter of\n\
    \   clearly identifying the key players and convincing them that their\n   incentives\
    \ were aligned.  It also involved developing approaches to\n   measure resiliency.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Getting to the Next Version of TLS
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Getting to the Next Version of TLS\n   Originally, the workshop had planned\
    \ to look at the question of\n   whether the IETF could mandate stronger security.\
    \  This evolved into\n   a discussion about getting to the next version of Transport\
    \ Layer\n   Security (TLS) and what challenges lie ahead.  It was pointed out\n\
    \   that there were still many old versions of TLS in existence today,\n   due\
    \ to many old implementations.  In particular, it was pointed out\n   that a substantial\
    \ amount of traffic is still encrypted using Triple\n   DES.\n   One concern about\
    \ the next generation is that perfect could become\n   the enemy of good.  Another\
    \ point that was made was that perhaps a\n   testing platform might help interoperability.\
    \  Finally, there was\n   some discussion about how new versions of TLS get promoted.\n"
- title: 7.  Outcomes
  contents:
  - "7.  Outcomes\n   This wide-ranging workshop discussed many aspects that go to\
    \ the\n   success or failure of the work of the IETF.  While there is no single\n\
    \   silver bullet that we can point to for making a protocol successful,\n   the\
    \ workshop did discuss a number of outcomes and potential next\n   steps.\n"
- title: 7.1.  Work for the IAB and the IETF
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Work for the IAB and the IETF\n   The IAB's role in working group formation\
    \ consists of providing\n   guidance to the IESG on which Birds of a Feather sessions\
    \ should be\n   held, reviewing proposed working group charters, and shepherding\
    \ some\n   work so that it can reach a suitable stage for standardization.  In\n\
    \   each of these stages, the IAB has an opportunity to apply the lessons\n  \
    \ of RFC 5218, as well as other work such as the notion of bundling\n   choices,\
    \ when members give advice.\n   In addition to working group creation, the IAB\
    \ has an opportunity to\n   track and present protocol success stories, either\
    \ through wikis or\n   through discussion at plenary sessions.  For instance,\
    \ at the time of\n   writing, there is much interest in Bitcoin, its success,\
    \ and what\n   parallels and lessons can be drawn.  Specifically, it would be\
    \ useful\n   to track examples of first-mover advantages.\n   Finally, one area\
    \ that the IETF may wish to consider, relating\n   specifically to DNSSEC, as\
    \ raised by our speakers was standardization\n   of the provisioning interface\
    \ of DNSSEC (DS keys) between parent and\n   child zone.  Contributions in this\
    \ area would be welcome.\n"
- title: 7.2.  Potential for the Internet Research Task Force
  contents:
  - "7.2.  Potential for the Internet Research Task Force\n   There are at least two\
    \ possible activities that the IRTF might wish\n   to consider.  The first would\
    \ be a research group that considers\n   protocol alternatives and recommendations\
    \ that might be useful in\n   areas where environments are constrained, due to\
    \ bandwidth or other\n   resources.  Such a group has already been proposed, in\
    \ fact.\n   The second possibility is a more general group that focuses on\n \
    \  economic considerations relating to Internet protocol design.  In\n   particular,\
    \ there were a number of areas that were presented to the\n   working group that\
    \ deserve further investigation and could use\n   collaboration between researchers,\
    \ engineers, and operators.  Two\n   examples are work on bundling and systems\
    \ biology.\n"
- title: 7.3.  Opportunities for Others
  contents:
  - "7.3.  Opportunities for Others\n   Incentive models often involve many different\
    \ players.  As we\n   considered work in the workshop, our partners such as ICANN\
    \ and the\n   Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) can continue to play a role\
    \ in\n   encouraging deployment of protocols through their policies.  Their\n\
    \   members can also participate in any activity of the IRTF that is\n   related\
    \ to this work.\n   Specifically, RIRs have a specific role to play in encouraging\n\
    \   security of the routing system, and ICANN has a specific role to play\n  \
    \ in securing the domain name service.\n   The suggestion was made that the IETF\
    \ working groups could leverage\n   graduate students in many universities around\
    \ the world in helping\n   review documents (Internet-Drafts, RFCs, etc.).  This\
    \ would serve as\n   a source of education in real-world processes to students\
    \ and would\n   engage the research community in IETF processes more thoroughly;\
    \ it\n   would also provide a scale-out resource for handling the IETF review\n\
    \   workload.  Several attendees who have such students were prepared to\n   try\
    \ this out.\n"
