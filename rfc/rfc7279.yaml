- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   There has been some recent concern expressed about a lack\
    \ of clarity\n   around when new message types and codes should be added to ICMP\n\
    \   (including ICMPv4 [RFC0792] and ICMPv6 [RFC4443]).  We lay out a\n   policy\
    \ regarding when (and when not) to move functionality into ICMP.\n   This document\
    \ is the result of discussions among ICMP experts within\n   the Operations and\
    \ Management (OPS) area's IP Diagnostics Technical\n   Interest Group [DIAGNOSTICS]\
    \ and concerns expressed by the OPS area\n   leadership.\n   Note that this document\
    \ does not supercede the \"IANA Allocation\n   Guidelines For Values In the Internet\
    \ Protocol and Related Headers\"\n   [RFC2780], which specifies best practices\
    \ and processes for the\n   allocation of values in the IANA registries but does\
    \ not describe the\n   policies to be applied in the standards process.\n   The\
    \ key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\
    \   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in\
    \ this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Acceptable Use Policy
  contents:
  - "2.  Acceptable Use Policy\n   In this document, we describe an acceptable use\
    \ policy for new ICMP\n   message types and codes, and provide some background\
    \ about the\n   policy.\n   In summary, any future message types added to ICMP\
    \ should be limited\n   to two broad categories:\n   1.  to inform a datagram's\
    \ originator that a forwarding plane anomaly\n       has been encountered downstream.\
    \  The datagram originator must be\n       able to determine whether or not the\
    \ datagram was discarded by\n       examining the ICMP message.\n   2.  to discover\
    \ and convey dynamic information about a node (other\n       than information\
    \ usually carried in routing protocols), to\n       discover and convey network-specific\
    \ parameters, and to discover\n       on-link routers and hosts.\n   Normally,\
    \ ICMP SHOULD NOT be used to implement a general-purpose\n   routing or network\
    \ management protocol.  However, ICMP does have a\n   role to play in conveying\
    \ dynamic information about a network, which\n   would belong in category 2 above.\n"

- title: 2.1.1.  ICMP Use as a Routing Protocol
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  ICMP Use as a Routing Protocol\n   As mentioned in Section 2, using ICMP\
    \ as a general-purpose routing or\n   network management protocol is not advisable\
    \ and SHOULD NOT be used\n   that way.\n   ICMP has a role in the Internet as\
    \ an integral part of the IP layer;\n   it is not as a routing protocol or as\
    \ a transport protocol for other\n   layers including routing information.  From\
    \ a more pragmatic\n   perspective, some of the key characteristics of ICMP make\
    \ it a less-\n   than-ideal choice for a routing protocol.  These key characteristics\n\
    \   include that ICMP is frequently filtered, is not authenticated, and\n   is\
    \ easily spoofed.  In addition, specialist hardware processing of\n   ICMP would\
    \ disrupt the deployment of an ICMP-based routing or\n   management protocol.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  A Few Notes on RPL
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  A Few Notes on RPL\n   RPL, the IPv6 routing protocol for low-power and\
    \ lossy networks (see\n   [RFC6550]) uses ICMP as a transport.  In this regard,\
    \ it is an\n   exception among the ICMP message types.  Note that, although RPL\
    \ is\n   an IP routing protocol, it is not deployed on the general Internet;\n\
    \   it is limited to specific, contained networks.\n   This should be considered\
    \ anomalous and is not a model for future\n   ICMP message types.  That is, ICMP\
    \ is not intended as a transport for\n   other protocols and SHOULD NOT be used\
    \ in that way in future\n   specifications.  In particular, while it is adequate\
    \ to use ICMP as a\n   discovery protocol, it does not extend to full routing\
    \ capabilities.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Applications Using ICMP
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Applications Using ICMP\n   Some applications make use of ICMP error notifications,\
    \ or even\n   deliberately create anomalous conditions in order to elicit ICMP\n\
    \   messages.  These ICMP messages are then used to generate feedback to\n   the\
    \ higher layer.  Some of these applications include some of the\n   most widespread\
    \ examples, such as PING, TRACEROUTE, and Path MTU\n   Discovery (PMTUD).  These\
    \ uses are considered acceptable because they\n   use existing ICMP message types\
    \ and do not change ICMP functionality.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Extending ICMP
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Extending ICMP\n   ICMP multi-part messages are specified in [RFC4884]\
    \ by defining an\n   extension mechanism for selected ICMP messages.  This mechanism\n\
    \   addresses a fundamental problem in ICMP extensibility.  An ICMP\n   multi-part\
    \ message carries all of the information that ICMP messages\n   carried previously,\
    \ as well as additional information that\n   applications may require.\n   Some\
    \ currently defined ICMP extensions include ICMP extensions for\n   Multiprotocol\
    \ Label Switching [RFC4950] and ICMP extensions for\n   interface and next-hop\
    \ identification [RFC5837].\n   Extensions to ICMP SHOULD follow the requirements\
    \ provided in\n   [RFC4884].\n"
- title: 2.4.  ICMPv4 vs. ICMPv6
  contents:
  - "2.4.  ICMPv4 vs. ICMPv6\n   Because ICMPv6 is used for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery,\
    \ deployed IPv6\n   routers, IPv6-capable security gateways, and IPv6-capable\
    \ firewalls\n   normally support administrator configuration of how specific ICMPv6\n\
    \   message types are handled.  By contrast, deployed IPv4 routers,\n   IPv4-capable\
    \ security gateways, and IPv4-capable firewalls are less\n   likely to allow an\
    \ administrator to configure how specific ICMPv4\n   message types are handled.\
    \  So, at present, ICMPv6 messages usually\n   have a higher probability of travelling\
    \ end-to-end than ICMPv4\n   messages.\n"
- title: 3.  ICMP's Role in the Internet
  contents:
  - "3.  ICMP's Role in the Internet\n   ICMP was originally intended to be a mechanism\
    \ for gateways or\n   destination hosts to report error conditions back to source\
    \ hosts in\n   ICMPv4 [RFC0792]; ICMPv6 [RFC4443] is modeled after it.  ICMP is\
    \ also\n   used to perform IP-layer functions, such as diagnostics (e.g., PING).\n\
    \   ICMP is defined to be an integral part of IP and must be implemented\n   by\
    \ every IP module.  This is true for ICMPv4 as an integral part of\n   IPv4 (see\
    \ the Introduction of [RFC0792]), and for ICMPv6 as an\n   integral part of IPv6\
    \ (see Section 2 of [RFC4443]).  When first\n   defined, ICMP messages were thought\
    \ of as IP messages that didn't\n   carry any higher-layer data.  It could be\
    \ conjectured that the term\n   \"control\" was used because ICMP messages were\
    \ not \"data\" messages.\n   The word \"control\" in the protocol name did not\
    \ describe ICMP's\n   function (i.e., it did not \"control\" the Internet); rather,\
    \ it was\n   used to communicate about the control functions in the Internet.\
    \  For\n   example, even though ICMP included a redirect message type that\n \
    \  affects routing behavior in the context of a LAN segment, it was not\n   and\
    \ is not used as a generic routing protocol.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document describes a high-level policy for\
    \ adding ICMP types and\n   codes.  While special attention must be paid to the\
    \ security\n   implications of any particular new ICMP type or code, this\n  \
    \ recommendation presents no new security considerations.\n   From a security\
    \ perspective, ICMP plays a part in the Photuris\n   protocol [RFC2521].  But\
    \ more generally, ICMP is not a secure\n   protocol and does not include features\
    \ to be used to discover network\n   security parameters or to report on network\
    \ security anomalies in the\n   forwarding plane.\n   Additionally, new ICMP functionality\
    \ (e.g., ICMP extensions, or new\n   ICMP types or codes) needs to consider potential\
    \ ways that ICMP can\n   be abused (e.g., Smurf IP DoS [CA-1998-01]).\n"
