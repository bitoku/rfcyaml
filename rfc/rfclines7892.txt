Abstract IANA defined the "OTN Signal Type" subregistry of the "Generalized Multi Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters" registry in RFC 7139.
This document updates the "OTN Signal Type" subregistry to allow registration via Specification Required.
Introduction IANA maintains "OTN Signal Type" subregistry of the "Generalized Multi Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters" registry for OTN signal types (as defined in [RFC4328] and updated by [RFC7139]).
This subregistry is defined to use only the Standards Action registration policy as defined by [RFC5226].
This document updates [RFC7139] to allow the "OTN Signal Type" subregistry to also use the Specification Required policy as defined in [RFC5226].
This document does not introduce any new security considerations to the existing GMPLS signaling protocols.
Refer to [RFC7139] for further details of the specific security measures.
Additionally, [RFC5920] provides an overview of security vulnerabilities and protection mechanisms for the GMPLS control plane.
IANA Considerations IANA maintains the "OTN Signal Type" subregistry of the "Generalized Multi Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters" registry.
The registry currently is defined to use the Standards Action registration policy as defined by [RFC5226].
Per this document, IANA has updated the registration policies for the "OTN Signal Type" subregistry to be "Standards Action" for Standards Track documents and "Specification Required" for other documents.
