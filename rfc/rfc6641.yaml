- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The NFS version 4 (NFSv4) protocol provides a mechanism for a\n\
    \   collection of NFS file servers to collaborate in providing an\n   organization-wide\
    \ file namespace.  The DNS SRV Resource Record (RR)\n   allows a simple way for\
    \ an organization to publish the root of its\n   file system namespace, even to\
    \ clients that might not be intimately\n   associated with such an organization.\
    \  The DNS SRV RR can be used to\n   join these organization-wide file namespaces\
    \ together to allow\n   construction of a global, uniform NFS file namespace.\n"

- title: 1.  Background
  contents:
  - "1.  Background\n   Version 4 of the NFS protocol [RFC3530] introduced the fs_locations\n\
    \   attribute.  Use of this attribute was elaborated further in the NFSv4\n  \
    \ minor version 1 protocol [RFC5661], which also defined an extended\n   version\
    \ of the attribute as fs_locations_info.  With the advent of\n   these attributes,\
    \ NFS servers can cooperate to build a file namespace\n   that crosses server\
    \ boundaries.  The fs_locations and\n   fs_locations_info attributes are used\
    \ as referrals, so that a file\n   server may indicate to its client that the\
    \ file name tree beneath a\n   given name in the server is not present on itself\
    \ but is represented\n   by a file system in some other set of servers.  The mechanism\
    \ is\n   general, allowing servers to describe any file system as being\n   reachable\
    \ by requests to any of a set of servers.  Thus, starting\n   with a single NFSv4\
    \ server, using these referrals, an NFSv4 client\n   could see a large namespace\
    \ associated with a collection of\n   interrelated NFSv4 file servers.  An organization\
    \ could use this\n   capability to construct a uniform file namespace for itself.\n\
    \   An organization might wish to publish the starting point for this\n   namespace\
    \ to its clients.  In many cases, the organization will want\n   to publish this\
    \ starting point to a broader set of possible clients.\n   At the same time, it\
    \ is useful to require that clients know only the\n   smallest amount of information\
    \ in order to locate the appropriate\n   namespace.  Also, that required information\
    \ should be constant\n   through the life of an organization if the clients are\
    \ not to require\n   reconfiguration as administrative events change, for instance,\
    \ a\n   server's name or address.\n"

- title: 3.  Use of the SRV Resource Record in DNS
  contents:
  - "3.  Use of the SRV Resource Record in DNS\n   Providing an organization's published\
    \ file system namespace is a\n   service, and the DNS [RFC1034][RFC1035] provides\
    \ methods for\n   discovery of that service.  This standard defines a mapping\
    \ from a\n   DNS name to the NFS file system(s) providing the root of the file\n\
    \   system namespace associated with that DNS name; such file systems are\n  \
    \ called \"domain root\" file systems.  From such file systems, like\n   other\
    \ NFS file systems, an NFS client can use the standard NFS\n   mechanisms to navigate\
    \ the rest of the NFS file servers that make up\n   the file system namespace\
    \ for the given domain.\n   Such domain root file systems are mounted at a conventional\
    \ point in\n   the NFS client namespace.  The mechanism results in a uniform cross-\n\
    \   organizational file namespace, similar to that seen in both AFS\n   [AFS][RFC5864]\
    \ and Distributed Computing Environment / Distributed\n   File System (DCE/DFS)\
    \ [DFS].  An NFS client need know only the domain\n   name for an organization\
    \ in order to locate the file namespace\n   published by that organization.\n\
    \   The DNS SRV RR type [RFC2782] is used to locate domain root file\n   servers.\
    \  The format of the DNS SRV record is as follows:\n      _Service._Proto.Name\
    \ TTL Class SRV Priority Weight Port Target\n   The Service name used is \"_nfs-domainroot\"\
    , in conformance with RFC\n   6335 [RFC6335].  The Protocol name used is \"_tcp\"\
    , for NFS service\n   over TCP.  Future NFS services using other protocols MUST\
    \ use another\n   protocol name.  The \"_udp\" label MUST NOT be used to imply\
    \ use of UDP\n   with NFSv4, as neither RFC 3530 [RFC3530] nor RFC 5661 [RFC5661]\n\
    \   defines NFSv4 over UDP.  The Target fields give the domain names of\n   the\
    \ NFS servers that export file systems for the domain's root.  An\n   NFS client\
    \ may then interpret any of the exported root file systems\n   as the root of\
    \ the file system published by the organization with the\n   given domain name.\n\
    \   The domain root service is not useful for NFS versions prior to\n   version\
    \ 4, as the fs_locations attribute was introduced only in NFSv4\n   (as described\
    \ in Section 1).\n   In order to allow the NFSv4 servers as given to export a\
    \ variety of\n   file systems, those file servers MUST export the given domain's\
    \ root\n   file systems at \"/.domainroot/{Name}\" within their pseudo-file\n\
    \   systems, where the \"{Name}\" is the name of the organization as used\n  \
    \ in the SRV RR.\n   As an example, suppose a client wished to locate the root\
    \ of the file\n   system published by organization example.net.  The DNS servers\
    \ for\n   the domain would publish records like\n      $ORIGIN example.net.\n\
    \      _nfs-domainroot._tcp IN SRV 0 0 2049 nfs1tr.example.net.\n      _nfs-domainroot._tcp\
    \ IN SRV 1 0 18204 nfs2ex.example.net.\n   The resulting domain names nfs1tr.example.net\
    \ and nfs2ex.example.net\n   indicate NFSv4 file servers that export the root\
    \ of the published\n   namespace for the example.net domain.  In accordance with\
    \ RFC 2782\n   [RFC2782], these records are to be interpreted using the Priority\
    \ and\n   Weight field values, selecting an appropriate file server with which\n\
    \   to begin a network conversation.  The two file servers would export\n   file\
    \ systems that would be found at \"/.domainroot/example.net\" in\n   their pseudo-file\
    \ systems, which clients would mount.  Clients then\n   carry out subsequent accesses\
    \ in accordance with the ordinary NFSv4\n   protocol.  The first record uses the\
    \ port number 2049 assigned to\n   NFS, and another port is specified for the\
    \ second record; the NFS\n   servers would provide NFS service at their indicated\
    \ port numbers,\n   and NFS clients would connect to the service via the corresponding\n\
    \   port numbers on those indicated servers.\n   Other file system protocols could\
    \ make use of the same domain root\n   abstraction, but it is necessary to use\
    \ different Service names not\n   specified here.\n"
- title: 4.  Integration with Use of NFS Version 4
  contents:
  - "4.  Integration with Use of NFS Version 4\n   NFSv4 clients adhering to this\
    \ specification implement a special\n   directory, analogous to an Automounter\
    \ [AMD1][AMD2] directory, the\n   entries in which are domain names that have\
    \ recently been traversed.\n   When an application attempts to traverse a new\
    \ name in that special\n   directory, the NFSv4 client consults DNS to obtain\
    \ the SRV data for\n   the given name, and if successful, it mounts the indicated\
    \ file\n   system(s) in that name in the special directory.  The goal is that\n\
    \   NFSv4 applications will be able to look up an organization's domain\n   name\
    \ in the special directory, and the NFSv4 client will be able to\n   discover\
    \ the file system that the organization publishes.  Entries in\n   the special\
    \ directory will be domain names, and they will each appear\n   to the application\
    \ as a directory name pointing to the root directory\n   of the file system published\
    \ by the organization responsible for that\n   domain name.\n   As noted in Section\
    \ 3, the domain root service is not useful for NFS\n   versions prior to version\
    \ 4.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Globally Useful Names: Conventional Mount Point\n   In order for the inter-organizational\
    \ namespace to function as a\n   global file namespace, the client-side mount\
    \ point for that namespace\n   must be the same on different clients.  Conventionally,\
    \ on Portable\n   Operating System Interface (POSIX) machines, the name \"/nfs4/\"\
    \ is\n   used so that names on one machine will be directly usable on any\n  \
    \ machine.  Thus, the example.net published file system would be\n   accessible\
    \ as\n           /nfs4/example.net/\n   on any POSIX client.  Using this convention,\
    \ \"/nfs4/\" is the name of\n   the special directory that is populated with domain\
    \ names, leading to\n   file servers and file systems that capture the results\
    \ of SRV record\n   lookups.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Mount Options

  - "4.2.  Mount Options\n   SRV records are necessarily less complete than the information\
    \ in the\n   existing NFSv4 attributes fs_locations [RFC3530] or fs_locations_info\n\
    \   [RFC5661].  For the rootpath field of fs_location, or the fli_fs_root\n  \
    \ field of fs_locations_info, NFS servers MUST use the \"/.domainroot/\n   {Name}\"\
    \ string.  Thus, the servers listed as targets for the SRV RRs\n   MUST export\
    \ the root of the organization's published file system as\n   the directory \"\

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This functionality introduces a new reliance\
    \ of NFSv4 on the\n   integrity of DNS.  Forged SRV records in DNS could cause\
    \ the NFSv4\n   client to connect to the file servers of an attacker, rather than\
    \ the\n   legitimate file servers of an organization.  This is similar to\n  \
    \ attacks that can be made on the base NFSv4 protocol, if server names\n   are\
    \ given in fs_location attributes: the client can be made to\n   connect to the\
    \ file servers of an attacker, not the file servers\n   intended to be the target\
    \ for the fs_location attributes.\n   If DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [RFC4033]\
    \ is available, it SHOULD\n   be used to avoid both such attacks.  Domain-based\
    \ service principal\n   names are an additional mechanism that also apply in this\
    \ case, and\n   it would be prudent to use them.  They provide a mapping from\
    \ the\n   domain name that the user specified to names of security principals\n\
    \   used on the NFSv4 servers that are indicated as the targets in the\n   SRV\
    \ records (as providing file service for the root file systems).\n   With domain-based\
    \ service principal names, the idea is that one wants\n   to authenticate {nfs,\
    \ domainname, host.fqdn}, not simply {nfs,\n   host.fqdn}, when the server is\
    \ a domain's root file server obtained\n   through a DNS SRV RR lookup that may\
    \ or may not have been secure.\n   The domain administrator can thus ensure that\
    \ only domain root NFSv4\n   servers have credentials for such domain-based service\
    \ principal\n   names.\n   Domain-based service principal names are defined in\
    \ RFCs 5178\n   [RFC5178] and 5179 [RFC5179].  To make use of RFC 5178's domain-based\n\
    \   names, the syntax for \"domain-based-name\" MUST be used with a service\n\
    \   of \"nfs\", a domain matching the name of the organization whose root\n  \
    \ file system is being sought, and a hostname given in the target of\n   the DNS\
    \ SRV RR.  Thus, in the example above, two file servers\n   (nfs1tr.example.net\
    \ and nfs2ex.example.net) are located as hosting\n   the root file system for\
    \ the organization example.net.  To\n   communicate with, for instance, the second\
    \ of the given file servers,\n   Generic Security Service Application Program\
    \ Interface (GSS-API) is\n   used with the name-type of GSS_C_NT_DOMAINBASED_SERVICE\
    \ defined in\n   RFC 5178 and with a symbolic name of\n           nfs@example.net@nfs2ex.example.net\n\
    \   in order to verify that the named server (nfs2ex.example.net) is\n   authorized\
    \ to provide the root file system for the example.net\n   organization.\n   NFSv4\
    \ itself contains a facility for the negotiation of security\n   mechanisms to\
    \ be used between NFS clients and NFS servers.  Section\n   3.3 of RFC 3530 [RFC3530]\
    \ and Section 2.6 of RFC 5661 [RFC5661] both\n   describe how security mechanisms\
    \ are to be negotiated.  As such,\n   there is no need for this document to describe\
    \ how that negotiation\n   is to be carried out when the NFS client contacts the\
    \ NFS server for\n   the specified domain root file system(s).\n   Using SRV records\
    \ to advertise the locations of NFS servers may\n   expose those NFS servers to\
    \ attacks.  Organizations should carefully\n   consider whether they wish their\
    \ DNS servers to respond\n   differentially to different DNS clients, perhaps\
    \ exposing their SRV\n   records to only those DNS requests that originate within\
    \ a given\n   perimeter, in order to reduce this exposure.\n"
