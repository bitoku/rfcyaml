  - "                      Announcement of RJS at UCSB\n    There now is resident\
    \ under socket 5 at UCSB a server program which\nsupports a subset of the Remote\
    \ Job Entry Protocol of RFC #407.  This\ndocument includes enough information\
    \ to allow the user to gain access\nto, and use the more basic function of UCSB's\
    \ RJS.  An RFC containing\nmore detailed documentation will be forthcoming shortly.\n\
    \    The accounting parameters needed to login to RJS are a userid and a\npassword,\
    \ each consisting of one to eight alphameric characters, the\nfirst of which must\
    \ be alphabetic.  The userid is, at present,\ncompletely arbitrary.  The password\
    \ is arbitrary the first time it is\nused with a particular userid; in subsequent\
    \ logins with that userid,\nthe same password must appear.  Eventually, users\
    \ will be assigned\nuserid-password pairs by UCSB Computer Center.\n    The only\
    \ transmission mode supported currently is T (TELNET-like\ncarriage control);\
    \ any other is treated as T.  The other modes will soon\nbe added.  The only disposition\
    \ supported is the default transmit-and-\ndiscard; any other is treated as transmit-and\
    \ discard.  The other\ndispositions may or may not be added later.\n    For consistency\
    \ and user convenience, the command 'INUSER' may be\nsubstituted for 'INID' and\
    \ 'OUTPATH' for 'OUT'.  The following commands\nare not as yet implemented: ABORT,\
    \ ALTER, BACK, HOLD, OP RECOVER,\nRESTART, AND SKIP.  At least some of these will\
    \ be implemented\nrelatively soon.\n    In order to accommodate users of TENEX\
    \ FTP servers, the commands\n'INACCT' and 'OUTACCT' have been added.  These are\
    \ used to set the\naccount number used in the file retrieval and storage operations,\n\
    respectively.  The command 'ACCT' may be used to get both account\nnumbers.  If\
    \ one of these account numbers has not been specified, the\nFTP 'ACCT' command\
    \ will be omitted from the appropriate file operation.\nThese commands have the\
    \ familiar syntax of <command verb> followed by\n<space> or optionally '-', followed\
    \ by <parameter> and <CR> <LF>.  The\n<operand> is an account number consisting\
    \ of one to six alphameric\ncharacters.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine\
    \ readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by Alex McKenzie\
    \ with    ]\n       [ support from GTE, formerly BBN Corp.             9/99 ]\n"
