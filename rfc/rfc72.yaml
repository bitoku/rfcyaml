  - "           PROPOSED MORATORIUM ON CHANGES TO NETWORK PROTOCOL\n       Bill Crowther's\
    \ RFC No. 67 raised a much more  fundamental  issue\n   than  the  question  of\
    \ marking.  Any change to presently established\n   protocol  is  going  to  involve\
    \  changes  in  the  hardware/software\n   development  efforts  that have, in\
    \ some instances, been going on for\n   over 6 months.  In the case  of  Multics,\
    \  this  effort  has  yielded\n   programs  either  complete or in the advanced\
    \ debugging stages.  This\n   is no doubt true for many other sites as well.\n\
    \       The arguments being developed  here  are  not  that  the  present\n  \
    \ protocol  is  ideal,  but  rather that everyone has agreed that it is\n   workable\
    \ and has begun implementation of it.  We would therefore like\n   to propose\
    \ a moratorium on most changes to this protocol for the next\n   6 months, or\
    \ however long it takes to get this system running and  to\n   observe its characteristics.\n\
    \       Specifically this means not making changes that only  effect  the\n  \
    \ efficiency  or  ease of implementation.  If a major design problem is\n   uncovered\
    \ it should still be brought forward  for  consideration,  as\n   could  issues\
    \ that represent extensions to the existing system.  But,\n   changes to the details\
    \ of the present system should not be made.\n       There are several points to\
    \ be made in favor  of  this  argument.\n   The  first,  and  perhaps  the  most\
    \ important, is getting the system\n   working as soon as possible.  The major\
    \ benefits of the network  will\n   be  in the uses to which it is put, and development\
    \ along those lines\n   cannot really get off its feet until the network is operational.\
    \   We\n   feel that, although the effort needed to reprogram part of the NCP\
    \ at\n   a later date will undoubtedly be greater, it will be  hidden  by  the\n\
    \   parallel  effort  then  going  on  involving network usage and higher\n  \
    \ level network development.\n       Another problem that immediately arises is\
    \ what should constitute\n   an  official  change to the protocol.  The history\
    \ of the development\n   of the current protocol shows that once an  idea  is\
    \  raised,  it  is\n   modified  many  times  before it is generally agreeable\
    \ to all.  Thus\n   each new suggestion  for  change  could  conceivably  retard\
    \  program\n   development in terms of months.\n       Finally there  is  the\
    \  consideration  that  an  idea  may  prove\n   unfeasible  once  actual operation\
    \ of the network begins.  Any one of\n   the currently agreed upon issues may\
    \  be  reopened  when  full  scale\n   testing begins to take place.\n       We\
    \ think that these considerations are important enough to freeze\n   the  network\
    \  protocol  unless  any  problems arise that would make a\n   certain feature\
    \ unimplementable.   Changes  then  leading  simply  to\n   greater  efficiency\
    \ would be saved until actual network operation has\n   been tested.\n       This\
    \ is not to say that new ideas  or  arguments  should  not  be\n   brought  forward,\
    \  but  that  they should be brought forward with the\n   understanding that they\
    \  are  not  to  be  considered  for  immediate\n   implementation but rather\
    \ to be discussed with a view toward possible\n   later implementation.  This\
    \ concept might  be  reflected  by  titling\n   such documents, \"Proposal for\
    \ Post-Moratorium Changes to ...\"\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable\
    \ form for entry ]\n          [ into the online RFC archives by Bob Hinden 6/97\
    \ ]\n"
