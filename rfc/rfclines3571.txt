Abstract This document describes a portion of the Policy Information Base (PIB) to control policy usage collection and reporting in a device.
The provisioning classes specified here allow a Policy Decision Point (PDP) to select which policy objects should collect usage information, what information should be collected and when it should be reported.
This PIB requires the presence of other PIBs (defined elsewhere) that provide the policy objects from which usage information is collected.
The Framework of Common Open Policy Service with Policy Provisioning (COPS PR)
Usage Feedback describes the overall approach to policy usage monitoring and reporting.
This document defines the specific Policy Information Base (PIB) framework for policy usage feedback.
The policy classes for monitoring and reporting policy usage feedback, as well as policy classes for controlling reporting intervals, suspension, resumption and solicitation are defined.

Selection, Usage and Linkage Policies
There are three basic types of policies used to define what the PEP is to monitor, record and report.
These are the selection criteria policy, the usage policy and the feedback report linkage policy.
The selection criteria policy is installed by the PDP.
It defines the conditions used by the PEP to monitor and record a usage policy.
The selection criteria policy may only be used for defining usage feedback selection criteria.
However, a more general case is a policy that already exists for policy enforcement that may also be used for specifying feedback usage selection criteria.
An example of this is the frwkRoleCombo instance, which may be used in defining QoS enforcement policies, but may also be used to specify conditions on which to base usage i.e. count the number of packets meeting the criterion of an interface capability set name and role combination.
The usage policy defines what attributes are recorded by the PEP.
These policies have an ACCESS clause of 'report only'.
Generally, the usage policies specify counts related to a specific action such as a packet being dropped.
The feedback framework PIB defines two usage policy classes, frwkFeedbackTraffic and frwkFeedbackIfTraffic.
Usage PRCs may be generic, collecting basic statistics, or they may be specific to a particular usage.
The PDP decides which PRC(s) best suit(s)
The PEP may support only one usage feedback PRC, in which case all statistics are gathered using instances of that PRC.
Alternatively, the PEP may support multiple usage feedback PRCs.
The PDP then decides which PRC to associate with a particular selection criterion.
A usage feedback policy and selection policy are tightly associated with one another.
A third policy, the frwkFeedbackLinkTable, is used to associate, or provide a linkage for the selection and usage policies.
The frwkFeedbackLinkTable also specifies when to report the usage feedback.
The frwkFeedbackLinkTable entry permits the same selection criteria instance to be re used for various usage feedback policies.
The frwkFeedbackLinkTable contains the value of the selection criteria instance as well as the value of the usage feedback PRC.
Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between the selection criteria, linkage and usage policies.
The PDP is not aware of the instance identifier of the usage feedback policy when installing the selection criteria and feedback linkage policies.
The usage feedback policy is instantiated on the PEP by the installation of a feedback report linkage and the PEP designates the instance identifier.
The usage feedback policy class always contains an attribute of type ReferenceId that contains the instance value of the associated frwkFeedbackLinkTable instance installed by the PDP.
An example of this is the attribute frwkFeedbackTrafficLinkRef.
Connection Establishment and Initial Configuration
Request The Accounting Timer object in the COPS Connection Accept message contains the minimum number of seconds between reporting intervals as described in [COPS] and [FEEDBACKFWK].
This is used as the basic unit of measurement in defining intervals for specific usage policies with the frwkFeedbackLinkInterval attribute.
The PEP notifies the PDP of the selection criteria policy classes and usage policy classes it supports during the initial request for configuration data using frwkPRCSupport instances [FR PIB].
The PEP also indicates whether it supports the frwkFeedbackLinkTable as well.
The PDP responds to the initial request for configuration with a DECISION that installs policies.
The PDP may also specify maximum reporting intervals associated with each of the usage policies.
This is done with the frwkFeedbackLinkInterval attribute in the frwkFeedbackLink class.
It may also specify reporting thresholds by including an instance of a threshold class (e.g. frwkFeedbackTrafficThreshold) in the decision.
The PEP monitors and records the usage per the conditions defined by its associated selection criteria policy.
Periodically the PEP reports the usage with a REPORT message or provides a REPORT when solicited by the PDP.
The PDP solicits usage feedback with the frwkFeedbackActionIndicator attribute of the frwkFeedbackAction class.
Unsolicited Reports Periodic Reporting Reporting may be periodic in nature and unsolicited.
The intervals at which the unsolicited reports are provided by the PEP are defined in the specific Linkage policies.
The defined intervals are based on the number of seconds specified by the PDP in the ACCT Timer value.
The PDP may specify that the associated usage instance be included in a periodic unsolicited report only if the threshold is reached and/or if the usage value has changed from the previous reporting interval.
There are cases when the PEP must supply unsolicited feedback reports that may not fall on an interval boundary.
The PEP MUST provide an unsolicited REPORT containing all defined usage instances just prior to the PEP issuing a Delete Request State and just prior to the PEP de activating a PIB instance context.
Reporting Conditions Periodic unsolicited reports for individual usage feedback instances can be suppressed by specifying additional conditions in the frwkFeedbackLink instances.
If this flag is set in the frwkFeedbackLinkFlags attribute, the associated usage instance is only included in a periodic unsolicited report if its value changed since the last unsolicited report.
If this flag is set in the frwkFeedbackLinkFlags attribute, the associated usage instance is only included in a periodic unsolicited report if the threshold condition referenced in the frwkLinkThreshold field evaluates successfully for the associated usage instance.
Both conditions can be combined in one frwkFeedbackLinkUsage object.
In this case, both conditions need to succeed for the usage instance to be reported.
Unsolicited reports triggered by a Delete Request State or the deactivation of a PIB instance are not subject to these conditions all usage objects must be included in these cases.
The PDP may solicit policy usage feedback by issuing an unsolicited Decision containing the frwkFeedbackActionIndicator set to `solicitReport'.
The PEP is to provide a solicited REPORT feedback containing usage feedback.
The PEP shall continue to provide periodic feedback at the specified intervals established at client connection acceptance.
The reporting conditions (ChangeOnly and Threshold) do not affect solicited reports all requested usage instances must be included.
Resuming and Suspending Periodic Feedback Reporting
The PDP may suspend usage monitoring and tracking at the PEP with the frwkFeedbackActionIndicator set to 'suspendMonitoringAndReports'.
The PEP must stop tracking usage information and must not issue any feedback reports.
The PDP may only suspend feedback reporting by setting the ActionIndicator to 'suspendReports'.
The PEP must cease sending unsolicited reports but is to continue monitoring and tracking usage.
The PDP may resume the sending of feedback reports and may resume usage monitoring by setting the ActionIndicator to 'resume'.
The PDP may suspend or resume all usage instances or the PDP may specify one or more instances that are to be suspended or resumed.
The frwkFeedbackActionList attribute contains a tag identifier that references a list of one or more frwkFeedbackActionList instances.
The PDP may halt usage monitoring, tracking and reporting of usage policies by removing the associated Linkage entry.
In the event that the connection is lost between the PEP and PDP, the PEP continues to track usage information as long as it continues to operate with the installed policy.
When the locally installed policy at the PEP expires, the usage policy data also expires.
Upon successful reconnection where the PEP is still caching policy, the PDP indicates to the PEP that the PEP may resume sending of the COPS accounting type report messages.
The PDP does this by issuing an unsolicited decision containing the frwkFeedbackResumeIndicator set to 'resume'.
The PEP should resume reporting at the next appropriate feedback interval established upon the acceptance of the re connection.
The PDP is aware of the request state Handle(s) and the supported PRCs either through the state synchronization mechanism or because the PDP considers itself synchronized with the PEP upon reconnection.
Usage Policy and Under specified Selection Criteria Some of the usage policy objects created in the PEP with COPS PR can be used by the PEP
multiple times they effectively act as templates for the objects created by the PEP.
COPS PR only has the identity (OID) of the object that is shared between all the assignments the PEP created.
However it is desirable to collect usage information for each of the derived objects individually.
This capability is achieved in the feedback framework PIB by distributing additional information to qualify a specific assignment of an object between the selection criteria PRC and the feedback usage PRC.
A selection criteria PRC that refers to a shared object, but contains no qualifying information, selects all of the object's assignments.
Such a selection criteria PRC SHOULD be combined with a feedback usage PRC that includes all the necessary information to identify a specific assignment a single selection criteria policy can then result in the generation of many feedback usage objects, one for each derived object.
If the selection criteria PRC contains all the required qualifying attributes for a specific assignment, it is combined with a feedback usage PRC that only contains the desired metrics but no additional attributes.
Example: A frwkRoleCombo instance may be used as a selection criteria, identifying a set of interfaces through their role combination and capability set.
If it is desired to get per interface traffic statistics, the usage PRC has to include an additional attribute to qualify the specific interface.
This could be achieved by linking the frwkFeedbackIfTraffic class with a frwkRoleCombo instance in a frwkFeedbackLink instance.
Multiple frwkFeedbackIfTraffic instances will be created by the PEP, one for each interface selected by the frwkRoleCombo instance.
The frwkFeedbackIfTraffic class contains the frwkFeedbackIfTrafficIfIndex attribute that allows the PDP to identify each interface's individual counters when the PEP reports the frwkFeedbackIfTraffic instances.
If traffic usage collection is only desired for an individual interface, a selection criteria should be used that qualifies the interface completely, for example a frwkIfRoleCombo instance.
In this case, it can be linked to the usage class that has no additional qualifying attributes, frwkFeedbackTraffic.
Summary of the Feedback Framework Policy Information Base 3.1.
Only The selection criteria and linkage policy classes follow the definitions specified by [SPPI].
This structure specifies well  defined policy classes and their instances residing in a common, virtual repository [FR PIB].
The additional PIB ACCESS clause attribute of "report only" denotes the usage policy class reported by the PEP.
The SPPI does not support the Counter32/64 textual conventions (TC) of SNMP for feedback collection two similar textual conventions have been defined in this PIB: Usage32 and Usage64.
In addition to the differential functionality of 'Counter', where only the difference between two samples generally carries information, a single value of a 'Usage' attribute usually provides absolute information, since  its initial value is known (0)  no wrap around events should occur  the time or event when the initial value was set should be available directly or indirectly from other objects.
When 'Usage' attributes are defined in a PRC, events that could cause a reset of the attribute to its initial value should be defined in the description as well as the mechanism that allows the PDP to detect the time of the last reset.
No usual COPS activity however should cause the reset of a Usage attribute.
3.3.  Feedback Groups and PRCs
These policy classes defined in this PIB are common to account type reporting for various technologies and apply to ALL SUBJECT  CATEGORIES.
The policy classes are divided into three new groups, namely, The Feedback Report Group, The Feedback Usage Group and The Feedback Selection Group.
The policy classes in the Feedback Report Group are:  Feedback Action  Feedback Action List  Feedback Selection Usage Combination Capability  Feedback Linkage  Feedback Traffic Statistics Threshold
The policy classes in the Feedback Usage Group are:  Feedback Traffic  Feedback Interface Traffic
The policy class in the Feedback Selection Group is:  Feedback RoleCombo Filter Selection 3.3.1.
The Feedback Action class contains the attributes that specify action that the PEP is to take regarding policy usage, monitoring and tracking.
The PDP may suspend usage monitoring and periodic reporting, suspend periodic reporting only, resume usage and periodic reporting or solicit immediate reporting.
The action may affect all feedback policies or be associated with one or more frwkFeedbackLink instances.
The frwkFeedbackActionIndicator attribute defines the action.
The frwkFeedbackActionPri attribute indicates whether the action applies to all of the usage policies or to a list.
The frwkFeedbackActionList attribute is the identifier of the list of Linkage policy instances to which the action is to be applied.
The PDP can solicit the PEP for immediate usage feedback.
The PEP shall respond with a solicited report containing the usage feedback.
The PDP can direct the resumption of usage monitoring and reporting per the defined intervals.
For example, the PEP may have re  connected to a PDP and has cached usage policies.
The PDP indicates to the PEP to resume usage tracking and monitoring and to send all the cached usage policy.
The PEP shall respond at the next appropriate interval with an unsolicited report containing the usage feedback.
The PDP can suspend the monitoring of usage policy.
The PEP maintains the current usage that has been monitored, but discontinues any further monitoring until the PDP directs the PEP to resume monitoring in a subsequent Decision.
The PDP can also suspend just the reporting of usage, but not interrupt the monitoring and tracking of usage.
The PEP shall discontinue sending Report messages with usage feedback until the PDP directs the PEP to resume.
The PEP then begins reporting the usage feedback at the next interval.
This class defines sets of linkage instances that can be referred to from the frwkFeedbackActionList attribute.
This class defines the valid selection criteria PRC, usage PRC and threshold PRC combinations supported by the PEP.
This class links the selection criteria instance with the usage class.
This table permits the reuse of a selection criteria instance for multiple usage policies.
The linkage table also permits the definition of a maximum reporting interval to use when issuing the COPS accounting type reports for the usage instance.
A value of 0 in this attribute indicates that the usage policy must be solicited.
This class is used to provide threshold values for the attributes described in the traffic usage classes below.
This class includes the packet counts, byte counts and a reference to the associated Linkage instance.
This class is similar to the previous Feedback Traffic class, except that it includes an additional reference to an interface index.
This class should be used with a selection criteria instance that matches an element that is assigned to multiple interfaces.
The interface field can be used to associate the instances of this table with the specific element's assignment.
This class is used as selection criteria based on role combination, capability set and a filter instance.

This PIB defines structured information that may be sensitive when transported by the COPS protocol [COPS PR].
This PIB does not contain classes that directly contain security relevant information like passwords or monetary amounts.
However, unauthorized access or changes to information defined in this PIB could compromise network operations or reveal sensitive business or personal information.
Specifically for the classes: frwkFeedbackLinkCaps This class has the ACCESS clause 'notify'.
Access to this information reveals feedback collection capabilities of the COPS client and malicious changes could affect feedback operation by misleading the server to generate corrupt feedback configuration.
These classes have the ACCESS clause 'install' and allow the COPS server to control feedback collection and reporting on the client.
Access to this information exposes the client's configuration; malicious changes could disrupt network or business operations and raise privacy issues.
frwkFeedbackTraffic, frwkFeedbackIfTraffic These classes have the ACCESS clause 'report only' and contain the usage information delivered from the COPS client to the server.
Unauthorized access to this information may reveal detailed information on the network and its users.
Malicious changes may affect network and business operations.
[COPS] and [COPS PR] define mechanisms to secure the COPS protocol communication and implementations of COPS servers or clients supporting this
PIB MUST follow the security guidelines specified there.
This document describes the frwkFeedbackPib Policy Information Base (PIB) module for registration under the "pib" branch registered with IANA.
The IANA has assigned PIB number 5.
This PIB uses "all" in the SUBJECT CATEGORY clause, so it applies to all COPS client types.
No new COPS client type is requested for this PIB.
