- title: Prerequisites
  contents:
  - "Prerequisites\n   This document assumes that you have examined different alternatives\n\
    \   for physical connectivity and will assist you in navigating the\n   Internet\
    \ infrastructure so that you can use that connectivity. In\n   choosing your upstream\
    \ provider, you should consider their ability to\n   deal with the Internet infrastructure.\n\
    \   What will you be doing and what role will you play?\n   o  If you are interested\
    \ in connecting yourself (or a small\n      organization), you are an Internet\
    \ end user.  You will probably\n      want to contact an Internet Service Provider\
    \ (ISP) for most of\n      your needs.  Read section I and the first part of section\
    \ II.\n   o  If you are interested in connecting your organization and in\n  \
    \    having address space to distribute within your network, you are an\n    \
    \  Internet high volume end user.  You will need more address space,\n      but\
    \ still may chose to work with an Internet Service Provider\n      (ISP) for most\

  contents:
  - "I.      Preparation of Systems and Network Planning\n   STEP ONE: PREPARE INFORMATION,\
    \ ORGANIZE HARDWARE, FIGURE OUT TO WHOM\n   YOU WILL CONNECT, AND TEST IN-COUNTRY\
    \ SYSTEMS.\n"
- title: A.  What do I need to connect to the Internet?
  contents:
  - "A.  What do I need to connect to the Internet?\n   You can connect using dial-up\
    \ or dedicated lines, and you can choose\n   UUCP or IP.  It is preferable to\
    \ be running the UNIX operating system\n   with TCP/IP over a dedicated line,\
    \ although you can begin by using\n   UUCP over a dial-up line.  Although there\
    \ are alternatives to UNIX,\n   for historical reasons and robustness UNIX is\
    \ better prepared to\n   handle Internet connectivity.  It is best to use TCP/IP\
    \ inside your\n   network even if you use another method for your external\n \
    \  connectivity.\n   You will need to obtain an Internet Protocol (IP) address,\
    \ or block\n   of addresses, and a domain name.  You may also need an Autonomous\n\
    \   System Number (ASN) and an IN-ADDR.ARPA (reverse addressing) domain\n   name.\
    \  However, you may begin by having dial-up connectivity to\n   another organization\
    \ that supports one or more mail exchange (MX)\n   record(s) for your site.  This\
    \ would allow you to receive email at\n   your own domain name without requiring\
    \ you to invest as much\n   initially.\n"
- title: B.  What connectivity medium should I choose?
  contents:
  - "B.  What connectivity medium should I choose?\n   You may be constrained by telecommunications\
    \ regulations in your\n   country as to your choice of dial-up, digital phone\
    \ lines, fiber\n   optic cable, or satellite suppliers.  If not, cost, bandwidth,\
    \ and\n   reliability will determine your choice.\n"
- title: C.  What else do I need to do?
  contents:
  - "C.  What else do I need to do?\n   Before you do anything else:\n   1. Designate\
    \ an administrative contact person and a technical contact\n   person.\n   Choose\
    \ one person to be the administrative contact and another person\n   to be the\
    \ technical contact.  Write down their full names, email and\n   postal addresses,\
    \ and telephone and fax numbers (with country\n   prefixes in the form + country\
    \ code (e.g., +011), city code, and\n   local telephone number).  The administrative\
    \ contact should be a\n   member of your organization and must reside in the country.\
    \  The\n   technical contact should be the key network support person and may\
    \ be\n   represented initially by someone outside of the country.  Note that\n\
    \   the technical contact must transition to a network support person\n   residing\
    \ in the country.  The Internet Registries will request this\n   information in\
    \ the form of database entries called objects.  For\n   example, on the RIPE template,\
    \ the administrative contact should be\n   listed in the admin-c field in the\
    \ database objects, and the\n   technical contact in the tech-c field in the database\
    \ objects (more\n   information on database objects follows in section II D below).\n\
    \   2. Determine your cost-recovery charging scheme, if needed, so that\n   you\
    \ can sustain operations.\n   No form or record will specifically request this,\
    \ but it is important\n   that you project your costs adequately so that you can\
    \ assess fees to\n   cover them and ensure stability of operations.\n   3. Diagram\
    \ your network topology.\n   Determine the number of groups and end users.  Describe\
    \ the size and\n   shape of your current network.  Design your addressing plan\
    \ based on\n   this information.  It may be helpful to consider your organization\n\
    \   chart when doing this, if you anticipate it to be fairly stable.\n   If you\
    \ are restricted to using the local telecommunications company's\n   telephone\
    \ circuit, choose your circuit carrier based on capacity and\n   where it lands\
    \ geographically.  Consider an asymmetric circuit, e.g.,\n   128kbps in and 64kbps\
    \ out, if you expect to have more incoming\n   traffic than outgoing (e.g., if\
    \ most of the traffic is expected to\n   originate from web servers outside your\
    \ network).\n   4.  Determine to whom you will connect.\n   See the prerequisites\
    \ section for types of connection providers that\n   might be appropriate for\
    \ your situation.  Determine which ISP or\n   telecommunications company best\
    \ fits your connectivity needs.\n   5.  Predict your address space and bandwidth\
    \ requirements from end\n   user needs.\n   Since address space is finite and\
    \ must be conserved, end users are\n   not permitted to reserve address space.\
    \  Address space is based on\n   what your needs are and how you justify those\
    \ needs.  Evaluation of\n   IP address space requests is usually based on the\
    \ documentation you\n   provide for the following 24 months (as per RFC 2050),\
    \ as specified\n   in the address space usage template and in the addressing plan\
    \ you\n   submit.  Once you have used your assigned address space, you can\n \
    \  request additional space based on an updated estimate of growth in\n   your\
    \ network.  This usually includes detailed documentation, updating\n   the appropriate\
    \ regional registry database with details of your end\n   user assignments, and\
    \ assigning address space both conservatively and\n   efficiently.\n   You will\
    \ need to justify your needs for address space by\n   communicating your network\
    \ design and should be prepared to clearly\n   present your plan for effective\
    \ use of the request.  Determine your\n   current and future user needs.  If you\
    \ are offering virtual web\n   services, it is no longer necessary to assign one\
    \ IP address per\n   domain.  HTTP/1.1 defines the \"host\" header to allow vanity\
    \ names\n   without the use of an IP address.  Allocations for points of presence\n\
    \   (POP) throughout your region should also be determined.  Predictions\n   of\
    \ user behavior can be based on analysis of published rates,\n   interviews with\
    \ individual and institutional subscribers, and case\n   histories of other countries\
    \ (see \"History of the Internet in\n   Thailand\").  For example,\n      Area1\n\
    \        10 dialup modems\n        10 leased lines to organization's LANs (size\
    \ of the LANs)\n      Area2\n         5 dialup modems\n      Main POP\n      \
    \   5 servers: mail, WWW, DNS, FTP, etc.\n   When you design your plan, you should\
    \ design it for what you need\n   now, what you believe you will need six months\
    \ from now, and then one\n   year and two years from now.\n   6.  Set up, connect,\
    \ and test your hardware and software.\n   It is important to ensure that you\
    \ have enough representative systems\n   set up and their connectivity tested\
    \ using temporary addresses before\n   contacting the appropriate agency for address\
    \ space.\n"

  contents:
  - "II.     Address Space Allocation\n   STEP TWO: OBTAIN ADDRESS SPACE ALLOCATION\
    \ AND REGISTRATION FROM THE\n   ISP YOU ARE CONNECTING TO, OR (AS A LAST RESORT)\
    \ YOUR REGIONAL\n   REGISTRY.\n   Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (under the\
    \ current version 4) are\n   32-bit numbers usually expressed as 4 octets in dotted\
    \ decimal\n   notation (for example, 128.223.162.27, which is the IP address for\n\
    \   the Network Startup Resource Center (NSRC) web server at the time of\n   this\
    \ writing).  Public IP addresses make up the Internet address\n   space.  Addresses\
    \ are allocated in a hierarchical manner and are\n   designed to be unique.\n\
    \   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) allocates large\n   address\
    \ blocks to the three current Regional Internet Registries\n   (IRs): ARIN, APNIC,\
    \ and RIPE NCC which, in turn, allocate smaller\n   blocks to Local Internet Registries\
    \ or large ISPs.  Local Internet\n   Registries, which are typically ISPs or collections\
    \ of ISPs\n   represented at a country level, and large ISPs process the vast\n\
    \   majority of address space assignments to ISPs and end users\n   Contact the\
    \ Internet service provider from whom you are getting your\n   connectivity services\
    \ (your upstream provider) with an address\n   allocation request.  It is important\
    \ and required that you contact\n   your upstream provider first, and not the\
    \ Regional IR automatically.\n   The first question the Regional Registry will\
    \ ask you is why you\n   cannot get address space from your upstream provider.\n"
- title: A.  Who is my upstream provider?
  contents:
  - "A.  Who is my upstream provider?\n   If there is an ISP already functioning in\
    \ your country, contact them\n   directly.  If you are to be the first connection\
    \ in your country, you\n   may need to contact your Regional IR in your geographic\
    \ region, but\n   you should always contact your upstream provider first for assistance\n\
    \   and guidance.  Since address allocation is hierarchical, the\n   administrative\
    \ organizations and procedures also represent this\n   hierarchical structure.\
    \  It is important not to skip a step in the\n   hierarchy.  Current Regional\
    \ Registries include ARIN (the Americas,\n   Caribbean, and Africa), RIPE (Europe,\
    \ Africa, and the Middle East),\n   and APNIC (the Pacific Rim and Asia).  Contact\
    \ information for these\n   organizations is listed in Appendix A.\n   You should\
    \ contact your Regional Internet Registry if 1) the ISP you\n   are connecting\
    \ to is unable or unwilling to provide address space, or\n   2) your particular\
    \ connectivity requirements will result in non-local\n   data to your customers\
    \ possibly taking a different route over the\n   Internet than data destined for\
    \ your upstream provider's customers,\n   or 3) you anticipate a quick growth\
    \ rate that may require changing\n   your current upstream provider to a larger\
    \ one and you wish to avoid\n   the renumbering that such a move would require.\n"
- title: B.  How much address space should I ask for?
  contents:
  - "B.  How much address space should I ask for?\n   Regional IRs typically assign\
    \ address blocks on the basis of an\n   immediate need and projected utilization\
    \ rate within one year.  (If\n   you are in the ARIN region, it is one year for\
    \ end user organizations\n   and three months for ISPs.)  Calculate your address\
    \ space request\n   accordingly.  It is recommended to include the organization\
    \ chart and\n   network topology diagram referred to in section I.C, number 3\n\
    \   (above).  Note that address space is allocated based on CIDR bit\n   boundaries\
    \ (see next section).  The registries will need to\n   understand your network\
    \ engineering and deployment plans in\n   significant detail before they can allocate\
    \ address space.\n   Therefore, the more detailed information you can provide,\
    \ the more\n   likely your request will be processed quickly.\n   If you obtain\
    \ address space from your ISP, it is very likely that you\n   will need to renumber\
    \ should you decide to change upstream providers\n   and/or if you grow considerably.\
    \  As this renumbering may affect your\n   customers (and their customers, etc.)\
    \ if they are using dedicated\n   lines, you should carefully weigh the cost/benefit\
    \ involved in\n   obtaining address space from your upstream provider.\n   If\
    \ you are singly homed, you should obtain your address space from\n   your upstream\
    \ ISP.  If you plan on enlarging but remaining singly\n   homed, you should continue\
    \ to obtain space this way as it promotes\n   aggregation.  If, however, you plan\
    \ to be multi-homed as part of your\n   growth plan, it would make sense to become\
    \ a member of an appropriate\n   Regional IR (or, if one exists in your region,\
    \ a national Network\n   Information Center (NIC) and obtain a /19 or \"provider\
    \ aggregatable\"\n   address space.\n   The minimum routable block is often a\
    \ /19, so if you plan on\n   enlarging, it is better to pay the fees to the Regional\
    \ IR now and\n   obtain a /19 block so that you will not have to renumber later.\
    \  Note\n   that if you are an ISP in the ARIN region, ARIN  has special\n   requirements\
    \ before you can do this in terms of the amount of address\n   space you have\
    \ previously used, which must be a /21.  The current\n   policy is that you must\
    \ have used a /19 previously from your upstream\n   ISP before going to ARIN,\
    \ or you must be multi-homed and show you\n   have used a /21 and be willing to\
    \ renumber and ARIN will issue a /20\n   from a reserved /19.\n   As of February\
    \ 8, 1999, ARIN lowered the minimum allocation size for\n   IP addresses from\
    \ a /19 to a /20.  ARIN will issue initial\n   allocations of prefixes no longer\
    \ than /20.  If allocations smaller\n   than /20 are needed, ISPs and end users\
    \ should request address space\n   from their upstream provider.  ARIN does not\
    \ guarantee that addresses\n   will be globally routable.\n   APNIC and RIPE NCC\
    \ do not have these requirements.  For APNIC, new\n   allocations to members will\
    \ be a /19.\n   Remember that your upstream provider should route you if you ask\n\
    \   them.  You are a customer of the ISP, so if the service is not what\n   you\
    \ need you should change ISPs.\n   IF YOU ARE CONNECTED TO ONLY ONE PROVIDER,\
    \ AND ARE NOT VERY LARGE\n   YET, GET AN ADDRESS RANGE FROM YOUR PROVIDER.  SKIP\
    \ THE REST OF THIS\n   SECTION AND ALL OF SECTION V.\n"
- title: C.  What is CIDR?
  contents:
  - "C.  What is CIDR?\n   CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing.  Historically,\
    \ IP\n   addresses were assigned within classes: Class A (8 bits of network\n\
    \   address, 24 bits of host address), Class B (16 bits of network\n   address,\
    \ 16 bits of host address), or Class C (24 bits of network\n   address, 8 bits\
    \ of host address).  With the advent of CIDR, address\n   space is now allocated\
    \ and assigned on bit boundaries.  Using CIDR\n   means you are able to assign\
    \ addresses corresponding with the number\n   of hosts on the network, thereby\
    \ conserving address space.\n   The following table illustrates this:\n   Addrs\

  - "D.  How do I request and register address space?\n   You will need to send a\
    \ database object to the appropriate registry\n   to request and register address\
    \ space.  The registration databases\n   are composed of records that are a series\
    \ of fields separated by one\n   or more blank lines; each field consists of two\
    \ parts, the tag and\n   the value.  Do not modify the tags in the templates or\
    \ errors will\n   occur.  Values for particular fields are specified in the templates;\n\
    \   be careful to enter appropriate information.\n   The first line of a template\
    \ denotes the record type.  For example,\n   an IP address template's first line\
    \ is inetnum, therefore the record\n   is known as an inetnum object.  This first\
    \ line is also used as the\n   primary key for the record, therefore if you want\
    \ to modify the first\n   field of the record, the only way to do so is to delete\
    \ the record\n   entirely and add a new record with the corrected information.\n\

  - "A.  What is an ASN and do I need one?\n   Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) are\
    \ used to facilitate routing in\n   multi-homed environments.  They are allocated\
    \ when your routing\n   policy is different from your provider's.  This generally\
    \ means your\n   site is multi-homed.  In nearly all cases, unless you are multi-homed\n\
    \   to more than one ISP, you will not need an ASN.  If your routing\n   policy\
    \ does not differ from your service provider's, you should use\n   the service\
    \ provider's ASN.  If there is constant traffic between you\n   and a point in\
    \ another country, you may want to connect to a second\n   ISP in that country.\
    \  Note that the resultant multi-homing generally\n   makes the system more robust\
    \ and may also change registry (and\n   therefore request) relationships.  It\
    \ also increases costs greatly.\n   You may have to reduce traffic on your international\
    \ lines by\n   choosing to connect to a local exchange point.  This allows traffic\n\
    \   to stay within your country and off of expensive international links.\n  \
    \ If you implement this plan, you will be multi-homed and will need to\n   read\
    \ the autonomous systems and routing sections of this document.\n"

  - "A.  Do I need to register with a routing database?\n   You do not need to register\
    \ with a routing database if you are simply\n   carrying default routes to your\
    \ (single) ISP.  If you get your\n   address space from an ISP, the ISP will register\
    \ you.  If you are\n   connected to more than one ISP, then you should register\
    \ with a\n   routing database.\n   The more multi-homed you are, the larger your\
    \ routing tables need to\n   be.  If you are connected to public exchange points\
    \ (see examples\n   below), or to more than one backbone ISP, you need to carry\
    \ full\n   routing tables and run without a default route.\n   Example European\
    \ Exchange Points:\n   LINX            London Internet Exchange\n   M9-IX    \
    \       Moscow Internet Exchange\n   NIX.CZ          Neutral Internet Exchange,\

    \ Area Ethernet - West\n   PAIX            Palo Alto Internet Exchange\n   Depending\
    \ on the requirements of your international ISP, you may be\n   able to have only\
    \ a default route to them and specific routes to\n   other suppliers if you have\
    \ an in-country exchange point.  Or they\n   may require that you carry a full\

    \ (NCC),\n   ANS (Advanced Network Solutions, Inc.), Bell Canada (formerly\n \
    \  CA*net), Cable and Wireless (CW), and the Routing Arbiter Database\n   (RADB).\
    \  The IRR is a way for ASNs to publicize their own intended\n   routing policies\
    \ without having to request a change from a go-\n   between.\n   \"whois\" queries\
    \ to \"whois.ra.net\" return data that they gather from\n   the entire IRR set\
    \ of routing registries.  Tools such as \"peval\" and\n   \"rtconfig\" return\
    \ data only from the RADB.  Thus, when running those\n   tools and desiring data\
    \ from a set of registries, one must enumerate\n   them as in the following example.\
    \  \"whois\" queries to the client\n   configure the precedence of routing databases.\
    \  For example:\n      @RtConfig set sources = \"TEST, RADB, RIPE, ANS, BELL,\
    \ CW\"\n   There are several other registries, such as ALTDB.  A list, and other\n\
    \   information on RADB, is available at:\n      http://www.radb.net/\n   As of\
    \ January 1, 2000, the transition to the Routing Policy\n   Specification Language\
    \ (RSPL) is complete.  RIPE-181 object\n   submissions are no longer accepted.\
    \  For more information, see:\n      http://www.merit.edu/radb/announce.html\n\
    \   With the exception of the Routing Arbiter Database, each registry\n   serves\
    \ a limited customer base.  ANS, Cable and Wireless, and Bell\n   Canada accept\
    \ routing registrations for their customers alone, and\n   the RIPE NCC oversees\
    \ European registrations. The Routing Arbiter\n   Database is unique in that it\
    \ handles registrations for networking\n   organizations not covered by the other\
    \ routing registries. The\n   Routing Arbiter also provides coordination among\
    \ all the registries\n   to ensure consistent representation of routing policies.\n\
    \   All Regional IRs need to register with one (only one) of the routing\n   databases\
    \ in the IRR. If you are announcing routes via BGP4, you need\n   to register\
    \ your routes in the Routing Registry in only one of the\n   IRR's.  Logically,\
    \ this will be the \"closest\" IRR to you.  However,\n   note that some ISPs do\

    \      ftp://ftp.apnic.net/apnic/docs/in-addr-request\n   CAUTION: You must set-up\
    \ your name server to accept the delegation\n   prior to submission of this form.\n\
    \   Send the completed form via email to APNIC at:\n      domreg@rs.apnic.net\n\
    \   For Countries in the ARIN Region\n   How IN-ADDR.ARPA is registered is dependent\
    \ on the registration of\n   the block needing reverse entries.  For example,\
    \ all blocks that have\n   been registered directly from the Regional IR may have\
    \ IN-ADDR.ARPA\n   delegation established by ARIN.  In this case, IN-ADDR.ARPA\n\
    \   delegations are registered using the ARIN modify template.  This\n   template\
    \ can be found at:\n      ftp://ftp.arin.net/templates/modifytemplate.txt\n  \
    \ or\n      http://www.arin.net/templates/modifytemplate.txt\n   Instructions\
    \ for completing the template can be found at the bottom\n   of the template.\n\
    \   CAUTION: Do not list your network number in reverse on the template.\n   Send\
    \ the completed form via email to ARIN at:\n      hostmaster@arin.net\n   All\
    \ blocks that have been reassigned to your organization by an ISP\n   will have\
    \ IN-ADDR.ARPA established by your provider.  In this case,\n   contact the ISP\
    \ that reassigned IP address space to your organization\n   and coordinate IN-ADDR.ARPA\
    \ delegation.\n   For Countries in the RIPE Region\n   The domain object needs\
    \ to be entered in the RIPE database before\n   requesting reverse delegation.\n\
    \   domain: 0.194.in-addr.arpa\n   descr: Our organization allocation\n   admin-c:\
