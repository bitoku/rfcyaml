The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
Short Overview of Fibre Channel
The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point to point serial data channel, structured for high performance.
Fibre Channel provides a general transport vehicle for higher level protocols such as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)
command sets, the High  Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and others.
Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple communication points, called N Ports, interconnected either by a switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point to point link.
A Fibre Channel "node" consists of one or more N Ports.
A Fabric may consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are switches.
An N Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch called an F Port.
When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single port on a switch via an "Arbitrated Loop" topology, the switch port is called an FL Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL Ports.
Nx Port is used to refer to either an N Port or an NL Port.
Fx Port is used to refer to either an F Port or an FL Port.
A switch port, which is interconnected to another switch port via an Inter Switch Link (ISL), is called an E Port.
A B Port connects a bridge device with an E Port on a switch; a B Port provides a subset of E Port functionality.
Many Fibre Channel components (including the Fabric, each node, and most ports) have globally unique names.
These globally unique names are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).
More information on WWNs can be found in [FC FS].
WWNs are expected to be persistent across agent and unit resets.
Fibre Channel frames contain 24 bit address identifiers that identify the frame's source and destination ports.
Each FC port has both an address identifier and a WWN.
When a Fabric is in use, the FC address identifiers are dynamic and are assigned by a switch.
Each octet of a 24 bit address represents a level in an address hierarchy, with a Domain ID being the highest level of the hierarchy.
Virtual Fabrics allow a single physical Fabric to be divided into multiple logical Fabrics.
Each Virtual Fabric may be managed independently like traditional Fabrics.
Virtual Fabrics are designed to achieve a better utilization of a physical infrastructure and to isolate events in one Virtual Fabric from affecting other Fabrics.
When one Core Switch provides switching functions for multiple Virtual Fabrics, that Core Switch is modeled as containing multiple Virtual Switches, one for each Virtual Fabric.
Each Virtual Fabric is identified by a 12 bit Virtual Fabric ID (VF ID).
When frames from multiple Virtual Fabrics are transmitted over a physical link, the VF ID carried in
a frame's Virtual Fabric Tagging Header (VFT Header) identifies which Virtual Fabric the frame belongs to.
The use of VFT Headers is enabled through an initial negotiation exchange between the two connected ports.
This MIB extends beyond [RFC4044] to cover the functionality, in Fibre Channel switches, of providing Fibre Channel's Virtual Fabrics function.
This MIB module provides the means for monitoring the operation of, and configuring some parameters of, one or more instances of Fibre Channel Virtual Fabric functionality.
(Note that there are no definitions in this MIB module of "managed actions" which can be invoked via a remote network management protocol such as SNMP.)
The following MIB module has IMPORTS from [RFC2578], [RFC2579],
[RFC2580], [RFC2863], [RFC4044], and [RFC4439].
In REFERENCE clauses, it refers to [FC SW 4].
Fibre Channel Management Instance A Fibre Channel management instance is defined in [RFC4044] as a separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality.
Fibre Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel management instances in whatever way is most convenient for the implementation(s).
For example, one such grouping accommodates a single SNMP agent having multiple AgentX
[RFC2741] sub agents, with each sub agent implementing a different Fibre Channel management instance.
The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC MGMT MIB [RFC4044] as the index value to uniquely identify each Fibre Channel management instance, for example within the same SNMP context ([RFC3411] section 3.3.1).
The t11vfVirtualSwitchTable augments the fcmSwitchTable, and the primary index variable of the fcmSwitchTable is fcmInstanceIndex.
Representing Core and Virtual Switches
In the presence of Virtual Switches, fcmSwitchTable in RFC4044 contains a row for each Virtual Switch.
fcmSwitchTable, t11vfCoreSwitchTable, and t11vfVirtualSwitchTable are complementary.
The t11vfCoreSwitchTable and t11vfVirtualSwitchTable contain information that helps the management client determine which Switches are Virtual Switches and how each relates to a Core Switch.
A Virtual Switch must reside in a single Core Switch, and a Core Switch is defined as a set of entities with the same Core Switch Name.
RFC 4044 was defined before Virtual Switches were standard and represented only physical Switches, so the RFC 4044 tables were not defined as read create.
With the advent of Virtual Switches, Virtual Switches can now be created by administrators, and read create tables are required.
The StorageType of RFC 4044 tables were not defined, and StorageTypes used in this MIB should also apply to the RFC 4044 tables that this MIB augments.

" DESCRIPTION "This module defines management information specific to Fibre Channel Virtual Fabrics.
A Virtual Fabric is a Fabric composed of partitions of switches, links and N Ports with a single Fabric management domain, Fabric Services and independence from other Virtual Fabrics.
This version of this MIB module is part of RFC 4747; see the RFC itself for full legal notices."

In switches that do not support Virtual Fabrics, this object has the value of 1.
If Virtual Fabrics are supported, this object is the maximum number of Virtual Fabrics supported by the Core Switch.
For the purpose of this count, the Control VF ID is ignored."
"The storage type for this conceptual row.
Conceptual rows having the value 'permanent' need not allow write access to any columnar objects in the row."
A table of Virtual Switches.
When one Core Switch provides switching functions for multiple Virtual Fabrics, that Core Switch is modeled as containing multiple Virtual Switches, one for each Virtual Fabric.
This table contains one row for every Virtual Switch on every Core Switch.
This table augments the basic switch information in the fcmSwitchTable Table in the FC MGMT MIB.
" REFERENCE "fcmSwitchTable is defined in the FC MGMT MIB [RFC4044].
An entry of the Virtual Switch table.
Each row is for a Virtual Switch.
This table augments the fcmSwitchTable, i.e., every entry in this table has a one to one correspondence with an entry in the fcmSwitchTable.
At the time when the fcmSwitchTable was defined, it applied to physical switches.
With the definition and usage of virtual switches, fcmSwitchTable now applies to virtual switches as well as physical switches, and (in contrast to physical switches) it is appropriate to provide the capability for virtual switches to be created via remote management applications, e.g., via SNMP.
So, this entry contains a RowStatus object (to allow the creation of a virtual switch), as well as a StorageType object.
Obviously, if a row is created/deleted in this table, the corresponding row in the fcmSwitchTable will be created/deleted."

A collection of objects for monitoring and configuring Virtual Fabrics in a Fibre Channel switch."
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: t11vfCoreSwitchMaxSupported, t11vfVirtualSwitchVfId, t11vfCoreSwitchStorageType, t11vfVirtualSwitchStorageType and t11vfVirtualSwitchRowStatus the ability to change the configuration of Virtual Fabrics on a particular switch.
t11vfPortTaggingAdminStatus, t11vfLocallyEnabledRowStatus, t11vfPortVfId, t11vfPortStorageType and t11vfLocallyEnabledStorageType
the ability to change the configuration of Virtual Fabrics on a port of a particular switch.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
, t11vfPortTaggingOperStatus, t11vfLocallyEnabledOperStatus, the ability to discover configuration of Virtual Fabrics on a virtual switch or a port.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
IANA Considerations IANA has assigned 147 for the MIB module under the appropriate subtree.
