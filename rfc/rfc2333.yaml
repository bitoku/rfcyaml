  - "2. Introduction\n   This document summarizes the key features of NHRP and discusses
    the\n   environments for which the protocol is well suited.  For the purposes\n
    \  of description, NHRP can be considered a generalization of Classical\n   IP
    and ARP over ATM which is defined in [3] and of the Transmission\n   of IP Datagrams
    over the SMDS Service, defined in [4].  This\n   generalization occurs in 2 distinct
    directions.\n   Firstly, NHRP avoids the need to go through extra hops of routers\n
    \  when the Source and Destination belong to different Logical Internet\n   Subnets
    (LIS).  Of course, [3] and [4] specify that when the source\n   and destination
    belong to different LISs, the source station must\n   forward data packets to
    a router that is a member of multiple LISs,\n   even though the source and destination
    stations may be on the same\n   logical NBMA network.  If the source and destination
    stations belong\n   to the same logical NBMA network, NHRP provides the source
    station\n   with an inter-LIS address resolution mechanism at the end of which\n
    \  both stations can exchange packets without having to use the services\n   of
    intermediate routers.  This feature is also referred to as\n   \"short-cut\" routing.
    \ If the destination station is not part of the\n   logical NBMA network, NHRP
    provides the source with the NBMA address\n   of the current egress router towards
    the destination.\n   The second generalization is that NHRP is not specific to
    a\n   particular NBMA technology.  Of course, [3] assumes an ATM network\n   and
    [4] assumes an SMDS network at their respective subnetwork\n   layers.\n   NHRP
    is specified for resolving the destination NBMA addresses of IP\n   datagrams
    over IP subnets within a large NBMA cloud.  NHRP has been\n   designed to be extensible
    to network layer protocols other than IP,\n   possibly subject to other network
    layer protocol specific additions.\n   As an important application of NHRP, the
    Multiprotocol Over ATM\n   (MPOA) Working Group of the ATM Forum has decided to
    adopt and to\n   integrate NHRP into its MPOA Protocol specification [5].  As
    such,\n   NHRP will be used in resolving the ATM addresses of MPOA packets\n   destined
    outside the originating subnet.\n"
  title: 2. Introduction

  - "3. Key Features\n   NHRP provides a mechanism to obtain the NBMA network address
    of the\n   destination, or of a router along the path to the destination. NHRP\n
    \  is not a routing protocol, but may make use of routing information.\n   This
    is further discussed in Section 5.\n   The most prominent feature of NHRP is that
    it avoids extra router\n   hops in an NBMA with multiple LISs.  To this goal,
    NHRP provides the\n   source with the NBMA address of the destination, if the
    destination\n   is directly attached to the NBMA. If the destination station is
    not\n   attached to the NBMA, then NHRP provides the source with the NBMA\n   address
    of an exit router that has connectivity to the destination.\n   In general, there
    may be multiple exit routers that have connectivity\n   to the destination.  If
    NHRP uses the services of a dynamic routing\n   algorithm in fulfilling its function,
    which is necessary for robust\n   and scalable operation, then the exit router
    identified by NHRP\n   reflects the selection made by the network layer dynamic
    routing\n   protocol.  In general, the selection made by the routing protocol\n
    \  would often reflect a desirable attribute, such as identifying the\n   exit
    router that induces the least number of hops in the original\n   routed path.\n
    \  NHRP is defined for avoiding extra hops in the delivery of IP packets\n   with
    a single destination.  As such, it is not intended for direct\n   use in a point-to-multipoint
    communication setting.  However,\n   elements of NHRP may be used in certain multicast
    scenarios for the\n   purpose of providing short cut routing. Such an effort is
    discussed\n   in [6].  In this case, NHRP would avoid intermediate routers in
    the\n   multicast path. The scalability of providing short-cut paths in a\n   multicast
    environment is an open issue.\n   NHRP can be used in host-host, host-router and
    router-host\n   communications.  When used in router-router communication, NHRP
    (as\n   defined in [1]) can produce persistent routing loops if the\n   underlying
    routing protocol looses information critical to loop\n   suppression. This may
    occur when there is a change in router metrics\n   across the autonomous system
    boundaries.  NHRP for router-router\n   communication that avoids persistent forwarding
    loops will be\n   addressed in a separate document.\n   A special case of router-router
    communication where loops will not\n   occur is when the destination host is directly
    adjacent to the non-\n   NBMA interface of the egress router.  If it is believed
    that the\n   adjacency of the destination station to the egress router is a stable\n
    \  topological configuration, then NHRP can safely be used in this\n   router-router
    communication scenario.  If the NHRP Request has the Q\n   bit set, indicating
    that the requesting party is a router, and if the\n   destination station is directly
    adjacent to the egress router as a\n   stable topological configuration, then
    the egress router can issue a\n   corresponding NHRP reply.  If the destination
    is not adjacent to the\n   egress router, and if Q bit is set in the Request,
    then a safe mode\n   of operation for the egress router would be to issue a negative
    NHRP\n   Reply (NAK) for this particular request, thereby enforce data packets\n
    \  to follow the routed path.\n   As a result of having inter-LIS address resolution
    capability, NHRP\n   allows the communicating parties to exchange packets by fully\n
    \  utilizing the particular features of the NBMA network.  One such\n   example
    is the use of QoS guarantees when the NMBA network is ATM.\n   Here, due to short-cut
    routing, ATM provided QoS guarantees can be\n   implemented without having to
    deal with the issues of re-assembling\n   and re-segmenting IP packets at each
    network layer hop.\n   NHRP protocol can be viewed as a client-server interaction.
    \ An NHRP\n   Client is the one who issues an NHRP Request. An NHRP Server is
    the\n   one who issues a reply to an NHRP request, or the one who forwards a\n
    \  received NHRP request to another Server. Of course, an NHRP entity\n   may
    act both as a Client and a Server.\n"

  - "4. Use of NHRP\n   In general, issuing an NHRP request is an application dependent\n
    \  action [7].  For applications that do not have particular QoS\n   requirements,
    and that are executed within a short period of time, an\n   NBMA short-cut may
    not be a necessity. In situations where there is a\n   \"cost\" associated with
    NBMA short-cuts, such applications may be\n   better served by network layer hop-by-hop
    routing. Here, \"cost\" may\n   be understood in a monetary context, or as additional
    strain on the\n   equipment that implements short-cuts. Therefore, there is a
    trade-off\n   between the \"cost\" of a short-cut path and its utility to the
    user.\n   Reference [7] proposes that this trade-off should be addressed at the\n
    \  application level. In an environment consisting of LANs and routers\n   that
    are interconnected via dedicated links, the basic routing\n   decision is whether
    to forward a packet to a router, or to broadcast\n   it locally.  Such a decision
    on local vs. remote is based on the\n   destination address. When routing IP packets
    over an NBMA network,\n   where there is potentially a direct Source to Destination\n
    \  connectivity with QoS options, the decision on local vs. remote is no\n   longer
    as fundamentally important as in the case where packets have\n   to traverse routers
    that are interconnected via dedicated links.\n   Thus, in an NBMA network with
    QoS options, the basic decision becomes\n   the one of short-cut vs. hop-by-hop
    network layer routing.  In this\n   case, the relevant criterion becomes applications'
    QoS requirements\n   [7]. NHRP is particularly applicable for environments where
    the\n   decision on local vs. remote is superseded by the decision on short-\n
    \  cut vs. hop-by-hop network layer routing.\n   Let us assume that the trade-off
    is in favor of a short-cut NBMA\n   route.  Generally, an NHRP request can be
    issued by a variety of NHRP\n   aware entities, including hosts and routers with
    NBMA interfaces.  If\n   an IP packet traverses multiple hops before a short-cut
    path has been\n   established, then there is a chance that multiple short-cut
    paths\n   could be formed. In order to avoid such an undesirable situation, a\n
    \  useful operation rule is to authorize only the following entities to\n   issue
    an NHRP request and to perform short-cut routing.\n     i)  The host that originates
    the IP packet, if the host has an NBMA\n         interface.\n     ii) The first
    router along the routing path of the IP packet such\n         that the next hop
    is reachable through the NBMA interface of\n         that particular router.\n
    \   iii) A policy router within an NBMA network through which the IP\n         packet
    has to traverse.\n"
  title: 4. Use of NHRP
- contents:
  - "5. Protocol Scalability\n   As previously indicated, NHRP is defined for the
    delivery of IP\n   packets with a single destination. Thus, this discussion is
    confined\n   to a unicast setting.  The scalability of NHRP can be analyzed at\n
    \  three distinct levels:\n     o Client level\n     o LIS level\n     o Domain
    level\n   At the the Client level, the scalability of NHRP is affected by the\n
    \  processing and memory limitations of the NIC that provides interface\n   to
    the NBMA network.  When the NBMA network is connection oriented,\n   such as ATM,
    NIC limitations may bound the scalability of NHRP in\n   certain applications.
    \ For example, a server that handles hundreds of\n   requests per second using
    an ATM interface may be bounded by the\n   performance characteristics of the
    corresponding NIC.  Similarly,\n   when the NHRP Client resides at an NBMA interface
    of a router, memory\n   and processing limitations of router's NIC may bound the
    scalability\n   of NHRP.  This is because routers generally deal with an aggregation\n
    \  of traffic from multiple sources, which in turn creates a potentially\n   large
    number of SVCCs out of the router's NBMA interface.\n   At the LIS level, the
    main issue is to maintain and deliver a sizable\n   number of NBMA to Network
    layer address mappings within large LISs.\n   To this goal, NHRP implementations
    can use the services of the Server\n   Cache Synchronization Protocol (SCSP) [8]
    that allows multiple\n   synchronized NHSs within an LIS, and hence resolve the
    associated\n   scalability issue.\n   At the NHRP Domain level, network layer
    routing is used in resolving\n   the NBMA address of a destination outside the
    LIS.  As such, the\n   scalability of NHRP is closely tied to the scalability
    of the network\n   layer routing protocol used by NHRP.  Dynamic network layer
    routing\n   protocols are proven to scale well.  Thus, when used in conjunction\n
    \  with dynamic routing algorithms, at the NHRP domain level, NHRP\n   should
    scale in the same order as the routing algorithm, subject to\n   the assumption
    that all the routers along the path are NHRP aware.\n   If an NHRP Request is
    processed by a router that does not implement\n   NHRP, it will be silently discarded.
    \ Then, short-cuts cannot be\n   implemented and connectivity will be provided
    on a hop-by-hop basis.\n   Thus, when NHRP is implemented in conjunction with
    dynamic network\n   layer routing, a scaling requirement for NHRP is that virtually
    all\n   the routers within a logical NBMA network should be NHRP aware.\n   One
    can also use static routing in conjunction with NHRP.  Then, not\n   all the routers
    in the NBMA network need to be NHRP aware.  That is,\n   since the routers that
    need to process NHRP control messages are\n   specified by static routing, routers
    that are not included in the\n   manually defined static paths do not have to
    be NHRP aware.  Of\n   course, static routing does not scale, and if the destination
    is off\n   the NBMA network, then the use of static routing could result in\n
    \  persistently suboptimal routes.  Use of static routing also has\n   fairly
    negative failure modes.\n"
  title: 5. Protocol Scalability

  - "6. Discussion\n   NHRP does not replace existing routing protocols. In general,
    routing\n   protocols are used to determine the proper path from a source host
    or\n   router, or intermediate router, to a particular destination.  If the\n
    \  routing protocol indicates that the proper path is via an interface\n   to
    an NBMA network, then NHRP may be used at the NBMA interface to\n   resolve the
    destination IP address into the corresponding NBMA\n   address.  Of course, the
    use of NHRP is subject to considerations\n   discussed in Section 4.\n   Assuming
    that NHRP is applicable and the destination address has been\n   resolved, packets
    are forwarded using the particular data forwarding\n   and path determination
    mechanisms of the underlying NBMA network.\n   Here, the sequence of events are
    such that route determination is\n   performed by IP routing, independent of NHRP.
    Then, NHRP is used to\n   create a short-cut track upon the path determined by
    the IP routing\n   protocol. Therefore, NHRP \"shortens\" the routed path.  NHRP
    (as\n   defined in [1]) is not sufficient to suppress persistent forwarding\n
    \  loops when used for router-router communication if the underlying\n   routing
    protocol looses information critical to loop suppression [9].\n   Work is in progress
    [10] to augment NHRP to enable its use for the\n   router-router communication
    without persistent forwarding loops.\n   When the routed path keeps changing on
    some relatively short time\n   scale, such as seconds, this situation will have
    an effect on the\n   operation of NHRP. In certain router-router operations, changes
    in\n   the routed path could create persistent routing loops. In host-\n   router,
    or router-host communications, frequent changes in routed\n   paths could result
    in inefficiencies such as frequent creation of\n   short-cut paths which are short
    lived.\n"

  - "7. Security Considerations\n   NHRP is an address resolution protocol, and SCSP
    is a database\n   synchronization protocol.  As such, they are possibly subject
    to\n   server (for NHRP) or peer (for SCSP) spoofing and denial of service\n   attacks.
    \ They both provide authentication mechanisms to allow their\n   use in environments
    in which spoofing is a concern.  Details can be\n   found in sections 5.3.4 in
    [1] and B.3.1 in [8].  There are no\n   additional security constraints or concerns
    raised in this document\n   that are not already discussed in the referenced sections.\n"
