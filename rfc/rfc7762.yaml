- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Content Security Policy (CSP) specification [CSP] defines\
    \ a\n   mechanism that web developers can use to control the resources that a\n\
    \   particular page can fetch or execute, as well as a number of\n   additional\
    \ security-relevant policy decisions.\n   The policy language specified in that\
    \ document consists of an\n   extensible set of \"directives\", each of which\
    \ controls a specific\n   resource type or policy decision.  This specification\
    \ establishes a\n   registry to ensure that extensions to CSP are listed and\n\
    \   standardized.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Use of the Registry
  contents:
  - "3.  Use of the Registry\n   Content Security Policy directives must be documented\
    \ in a readily\n   available public specification in order to be registered by\
    \ IANA.\n   This documentation MUST fully explain the syntax, intended usage,\
    \ and\n   semantics of the directive.  The intent of this requirement is to\n\
    \   assure interoperable independent implementations, and to prevent\n   accidental\
    \ namespace collisions between implementations of dissimilar\n   features.\n \
    \  Documents defining new Content Security Policy directives MUST\n   register\
    \ them with IANA, as described in Section 3.  The IANA\n   registration policy\
    \ for such parameters is \"Specification Required\"\n   [RFC5226] and is further\
    \ discussed in Section 3.2.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   This specification creates a new top-level IANA registry\
    \ named\n   \"Content Security Policy Directives\".\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Content Security Policy Directives Registry\n   New Content Security Policy\
    \ directives, and updates to existing\n   directives, MUST be registered with\
    \ IANA.\n   When registering a new Content Security Policy directive, the\n  \
    \ following information MUST be provided:\n   o  The directive's name, an ASCII\
    \ string conforming to the\n      \"directive-name\" rule specified in Section\
    \ 4.1 of [CSP].  The ABNF\n      [RFC5234] is as follows:\n          directive-name\

- title: 4.2.  Registration Policy for Content Security Policy Directives
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Registration Policy for Content Security Policy Directives\n   The registration\
    \ policy for Content Security Policy directives is\n   \"Specification Required\"\
    \ [RFC5226], which uses a designated expert to\n   review the specification.\n\
    \   When appointing an Expert (or Experts), the IESG SHOULD draw from the\n  \
    \ W3C's security community, coordinating through the liaison.\n   The designated\
    \ expert, when deliberating on whether to include a new\n   directive in the registry,\
    \ SHOULD consider the following criteria.\n   This is not an exhaustive list,\
    \ but representative of the issues to\n   consider when rendering a decision:\n\
    \   o  Content Security Policy is a restrictive feature, which allows web\n  \
    \    developers to deny themselves access to resources and APIs that\n      would\
    \ otherwise be available.  Deploying Content Security Policy\n      is, therefore,\
    \ a strict reduction in risk.  The expert SHOULD\n      carefully consider whether\
    \ proposed directives would violate this\n      property.\n   o  Granular directives\
    \ are valuable, but the expert SHOULD strive to\n      strike a reasonable balance\
    \ between providing developers with all\n      the knobs and switches possible\
    \ and providing only those with\n      known security implications.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The registry in this document does not in itself\
    \ have security\n   implications.  The directives specified, however, certainly\
    \ do.  The\n   documents referenced when registering new directives MUST contain\n\
    \   detailed security and privacy considerations sections, and SHOULD\n   contain\
    \ usage information that informs web developers as to the\n   directive's expected\
    \ implementation.\n"
