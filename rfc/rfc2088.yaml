- title: 1.   Abstract
  contents:
  - "1.   Abstract\n   The Internet Message Access Protocol [IMAP4] contains the \"\
    literal\"\n   syntactic construct for communicating strings.  When sending a\n\
    \   literal from client to server, IMAP4 requires the client to wait for\n   the\
    \ server to send a command continuation request between sending the\n   octet\
    \ count and the string data.  This document specifies an\n   alternate form of\
    \ literal which does not require this network round\n   trip.\n"

  - "2.   Conventions Used in this Document\n   In examples, \"C:\" and \"S:\" indicate\
    \ lines sent by the client and\n   server respectively.\n"
- title: 3.   Specification
  contents:
  - "3.   Specification\n   The non-synchronizing literal is added an alternate form\
    \ of literal,\n   and may appear in communication from client to server instead\
    \ of the\n   IMAP4 form of literal.  The IMAP4 form of literal, used in\n   communication\
    \ from client to server, is referred to as a\n   synchronizing literal.\n   Non-synchronizing\
    \ literals may be used with any IMAP4 server\n   implementation which returns\
    \ \"LITERAL+\" as one of the supported\n   capabilities to the CAPABILITY command.\
    \  If the server does not\n   advertise the LITERAL+ capability, the client must\
    \ use synchronizing\n   literals instead.\n   The non-synchronizing literal is\
    \ distinguished from the original\n   synchronizing literal by having a plus ('+')\
    \ between the octet count\n   and the closing brace ('}').  The server does not\
    \ generate a command\n   continuation request in response to a non-synchronizing\
    \ literal, and\n   clients are not required to wait before sending the octets\
    \ of a non-\n   synchronizing literal.\n   The protocol receiver of an IMAP4 server\
    \ must check the end of every\n   received line for an open brace ('{') followed\
    \ by an octet count, a\n   plus ('+'), and a close brace ('}') immediately preceeding\
    \ the CRLF.\n   If it finds this sequence, it is the octet count of a non-\n \
    \  synchronizing literal and the server MUST treat the specified number\n   of\
    \ following octets and the following line as part of the same\n   command.  A\
    \ server MAY still process commands and reject errors on a\n   line-by-line basis,\
    \ as long as it checks for non-synchronizing\n   literals at the end of each line.\n\
    \   Example:    C: A001 LOGIN {11+}\n               C: FRED FOOBAR {7+}\n    \
    \           C: fat man\n               S: A001 OK LOGIN completed\n"

    \ Backus-Naur\n   Form (BNF) notation as specified in [RFC-822] as modified by\
    \ [IMAP4].\n   Non-terminals referenced but not defined below are as defined by\n\
