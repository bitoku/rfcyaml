  - "2.  Introduction\n   The Internet is a world-wide network of networks with gateways\n\
    \   linking organizations in North and South America, Europe, The Pacific\n  \
    \ Basin and other countries not previously included.  The organizations\n   are\
    \ administratively independent from one another.  There is no\n   central, worldwide,\
    \ technical control point.  Yet, working together\n   these organizations have\
    \ created what to a user seems to be a single\n   virtual network that spans the\
    \ globe.\n   The networks all use a common suite of networking protocols, TCP/IP.\n\
    \   It is because of this commonality of protocols, this commonality of\n   network\
    \ functionality and interoperability that the networks provide\n   what may appear\
    \ to be a seamless, integrated virtual network,\n   irregardless of the underlying\
    \ heterogeneity of the underlying\n   computer hardware or communications transport.\n\
    \   The most basic functions provided are electronic mail, access to\n   remote\
    \ computational and informational facilities and file transfer.\n   The networking\
    \ protocols were first deployed in the late 1960's in\n   the United States. \
    \ For several years, they were only used for very\n   specific research activities\
    \ and in some computer science\n   departments.\n   In 1985, at a meeting of National\
    \ Science Foundation networking\n   specialists and higher educations representatives,\
    \ a new national\n   data networking backbone, using these protocols, was outlined\
    \ and\n   acted as a catalyst resulting in dramatic changes in data networking\n\
    \   technologies and usage.\n   Originally conceived to connect the six national\
    \ supercomputing\n   centers that had been established, in the ensuing years,\
    \ the NSFNet\n   backbone network and its associated mid-level networks have grown\n\
    \   dramatically.  The networks built for mission and discipline specific\n  \
    \ uses have also grown dramatically.  More importantly, because of the\n   common\
    \ technology, they have been able to be connected together,\n   increasing their\
    \ reach and as a result, their usefulness to the user\n   community with very\
    \ little additional expense.  The end result is a\n   robust technology supporting\
    \ the higher education and research\n   community.  Its continued development\
    \ and growth are essential to\n   maintaining excellence in education and research.\n\
    \   The use of the Internet has steadily and dramatically grown over the\n   past\
    \ years.  More and more sites have connected.  Each site may have\n   more and\
    \ more uses of the network, as existing users expand and new\n   users are added\
    \ resulting in exponential growth of network traffic.\n   But even more dramatic\
    \ are the explosions in growth due to the\n   innovative applications.  Networks\
    \ are having a dramatic effect on\n   everything from libraries to elementary\
    \ schools, from sharing\n   expensive scientific instruments to using databases\
    \ to access\n   atmospheric data to electronic publishing and interpersonal\n\
    \   collaborations building \"workplaces without walls\".\n   The number of organizations\
    \ connected at present is constantly\n   growing.  At present, the organizations\
    \ that connect through the\n   Internet include universities and colleges, research\
    \ laboratories,\n   government and private, libraries, specialized scientific\
    \ centers,\n   state agencies, K-12 (Kindergarten-12th Grade) organizations,\n\
    \   individuals, and individual research labs.  But no matter what kind\n   of\
    \ organization it is, they all have the same need to understand what\n   it means\
    \ to connect to the Internet.\n   An institution must anticipate and prepare for\
    \ four critical phases\n   in the deployment of an Internet connection.  The list\
    \ of issues\n   discussed within this document is not exhaustive but rather the\n\
    \   information provided should alert decision makers to major concerns\n   they\
    \ should address during the different phases of network\n   deployment.\n   As\
    \ each issue is discussed, both soft and hard cost items will be\n   identified.\
    \  Both must be considered when determining the real cost\n   of deploying an\
    \ Internet connection.  The hard cost items include\n   costs for which invoices\
    \ are created.  They include the costs for new\n   circuits or phone lines, the\
    \ purchase of modems or csu's and routers,\n   network membership dues and upgrades\
    \ to existing hardware to make it\n   network compatible.  Soft costs are harder\
    \ to quantify but no less\n   important.  These costs include training and education\
    \ of staff,\n   faculty, and students, modifications to support staffing and\n\
    \   structure, deployment of new network applications or network services\n  \
    \ such as FTP servers, centralized electronic mail services, or\n   campus-wide\
    \ information systems.  It should also be recognized that\n   the soft costs involved\
    \ also result in benefits that can easily be\n   seen as people investment and\
    \ organizational investment.\n   The four phases of an Internet Connection deployment\
    \ are:\n      A.  Initial planning/Pre-Internet installation phase\n      B. \
    \ Initial Implementation and Startup phase\n      C.  Full Production/Maintenance\
    \ phase\n      D.  Evaluation/Upgrade phase\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1  Ask the Vital Question\n   An institution must first address the question,\
    \ \"What does my\n   community/institution gain from participating in the Internet\n\
    \   community?\".\n   Both commercial and non-profit education and research institutions\n\
    \   rightfully spend a great deal of high level effort to define their\n   mission\
    \ and goals.  Any introduction of new technology --\n   particularly one which\
    \ involves new modes and methodologies of\n   communication -- should be assessed\
    \ in light of the institution's own\n   mission and goals as well as the wants\
    \ and needs of the user\n   community it serves.\n   Following, and as part of\
    \ this evaluation, key institution decision\n   makers (at the highest levels\
    \ of the organization) will require\n   information not only on the cost of connection,\
    \ but more importantly\n   on the purpose and scope of participation in the Internet.\
    \  The\n   decision to participate requires not only the strong commitment of\n\
    \   senior administration but also the support and endorsement of the\n   general\
    \ institutional community.  In the case of an educational\n   institution, it\
    \ is critical to have the support and active interest\n   of the faculty.  This\
    \ decision will also involve a campus wide needs\n   assessment to determine the\
    \ interest and support of the campus\n   community.\n"
- title: 3.2  Reasons Why to Participate
  contents:
  - "3.2  Reasons Why to Participate\n   The deployment of an Internet connection\
    \ provides the impetus for the\n   development of a campus wide strategy for the\
    \ use of information\n   technology which may otherwise never be accessible. \
    \ It may be\n   difficult to quantify such benefits but they must be included\
    \ in the\n   justification process.  Many institutions have already done this\
    \ and\n   are very likely already connected.  An interested institution might\n\
    \   will consult with a nearby, connected organization to see what\n   benefit\
    \ they have derived from the connection.  An institution\n   looking at a connection\
    \ for the first time must decide if a major\n   reason is simply to participate\
    \ in a technology that has already\n   proven itself as being important to education;\
    \ more importantly, it\n   may be a requirement now to compete with peer organizations.\n\
    \   This is especially important to consider when recruiting both new\n   faculty\
    \ and students.  New faculty will want to continue with their\n   research and\
    \ academic collaborations which may require resources not\n   affordable to the\
    \ institution.  These resources can be made available\n   via the network.  As\
    \ a result, a university or college may be able to\n   recruit students and offer\
    \ a new curriculum that demands access to\n   resources that would only be available\
    \ via the network.  The\n   potential gain in prestige, research participation\
    \ and dollars is\n   well work the investment.\n   Many universities have also\
    \ discovered economic efficiencies.  Many\n   subscription services have traditionally\
    \ required a dedicated and\n   expensive access method.  More and more of these\
    \ services are now\n   accessible via the Internet.  This trend will undoubtedly\
    \ continue as\n   more and more commercial companies make their services available.\n\
    \   While the subscription fee may not alter, the cost of the dedicated\n   connection\
    \ may by used to finance an Internet connection; not only\n   will the availability\
    \ of the particular service be greater but the\n   underlying access medium can\
    \ be used for multiple functions.\n   Libraries, many already with automated catalogs,\
    \ are looking at\n   various new applications to deal with the glut of information,\n\
    \   shrinking dollars and limited shelf space.  Electronic journals,\n   image-based\
    \ text, publishing on demand are all issues that are being\n   evaluated for the\
    \ digital library.  Universities are automating and\n   integrating a variety\
    \ of activities and providing access to the\n   students and staff via a campus\
    \ network.  At some universities,\n   students are able to register for classes,\
    \ look at their grades, and\n   check their bill from their dorm room instead\
    \ of having to suffer\n   through long lines.  Some universities are able to keep\
    \ in contact\n   with their alumni, through a variety of on-line information\n\
    \   resources.\n   NSFNet was first created to facilitate access to five national\n\
    \   supercomputer centers, centers which still provide to researchers\n   leading\
    \ edge computational technologies to support research in a\n   variety of areas,\
    \ from black holes to pollution in the L.A. basin.\n   Today, researchers and\
    \ students alike have access to a broad range of\n   computational, informational,\
    \ and scientific instrumentation that can\n   be used remotely, with no loss of\
    \ productivity.  For some\n   organizations, this means that they now can recruit\
    \ faculty with\n   research requirements that they themselves could never afford.\
    \  It\n   means access to research funding.  At the same time, it opens up the\n\
    \   opportunity to faculty and students to select their next institution\n   for\
    \ reasons other than the hardware currently owned.\n"
- title: 3.3  Connection Options
  contents:
  - "3.3  Connection Options\n   There are a variety of connection options.  Factors\
    \ besides costs may\n   be used to select the appropriate option or a series of\
    \ options.\n   These factors include size and projected use (traffic) of the\n\
    \   connection, nature of the use and purpose of the enterprise driving\n   the\
    \ effort.\n   There are three basic categories of IP service connection available\n\
    \   at this time.  All three categories support essentially the same set\n   of\
    \ functions.  They support a variety of line speeds (which affects\n   total capacity\
    \ of the connection) and will run on a variety of\n   hardware platforms.  Performance\
    \ depends on the line speed, the\n   hardware and software used, and the use.\n\
    \   The three basic connection categories are:\n        a)  dedicated connection\n\
    \        b)  dialup connection\n        c)  dialup access to a connection service\n\
    \   A dedicated connection requires a dedicated, point-to-point\n   telecommunications\
    \ circuit and an IP router (a dedicated networking\n   device), linking the organization\
    \ to the Internet.  Line speeds range\n   from 9.6 Kb to 45 Mb, with the most\
    \ common connection speeds being\n   56Kb and 1.54 Mb.  A dedicated connection\
    \ to the Internet most\n   commonly connects to a campus-wide network with several\
    \ hosts and\n   workstations.\n   A dialup connection requires a workstation,\
    \ which may or may not be\n   dedicated to networking, with appropriate networking\
    \ software and an\n   attached modem.  It uses a regular phone line.  When a network\n\
    \   connection is needed, the workstation is used to establish a\n   connection\
    \ over the modem and phone line. At the end of use, the\n   connection is broken.\
    \  Line speeds range from 9.6Kb to 56Kb, with\n   lower speeds being most common.\
    \  It can be used to connect a single\n   workstation or a LAN.  However, if it\
    \ is used to connect a LAN, the\n   workstation must provide some routing functionality.\n\
    \   Several IP service providers offer dialup access to a connection\n   service.\
    \  Such a service provides only remote login capabilities or\n   other limited\
    \ functions by calling a local phone number and setting\n   up a single function\
    \ environment.  A terminal emulator is used from a\n   MAC or a PC.  The service\
    \ can support speeds from 2.4Kb - 19.2 Kb.\n   Providers usually charge a flat-rate\
    \ connection fee as opposed to a\n   connection fee and traffic charge.\n   As\
    \ each type of connection alternative is examined, the organization\n   must consider\
    \ the technical evolution and cost projections.  The\n   appropriate campus agency\
    \ (usually an information or\n   telecommunications area) should inventory the\
    \ existing campus\n   networking.  For those organizations that do currently have\
    \ a campus\n   network, the inventory will provide valuable input to the development\n\
    \   of a short and long term technology evolution strategy.\n   If a campus network\
    \ does not yet exist, the development of a campus\n   networking strategy may\
    \ have the effect of an upgrade of technology\n   throughout the campus.  In either\
    \ case, the question of how to get\n   network connectivity to the workstations\
    \ on the faculty and staff\n   desks, large user rooms, residence halls, libraries\
    \ and campus stores\n   must eventually be addressed.\n   A connection to the\
    \ Internet does not always imply the development of\n   a campus-wide network.\
    \  In some cases, it may be appropriate for only\n   a small segment of the organization's\
    \ community to have access to the\n   Internet.  Often, organizations will use\
    \ such a strategy as a way to\n   introduce the technology to a small group of\
    \ enthusiastic customers\n   who become champions in their own right.\n"

  - "3.4  Connection Service Providers\n   There are several organizations, not-for-profit\
    \ and commercial, that\n   now offer connectivity services to the Internet.  Refer\

- title: 3.6  Cost Assessment
  contents:
  - "3.6  Cost Assessment\n   An organization contemplating a connection to the Internet\
    \ should be\n   careful to consider not only the physical connection and startup\n\
    \   costs but also the costs of supporting the resulting service\n   infrastructure.\
    \  This infrastructure includes the development and\n   continued support of a\
    \ campus-wide network.  At some universities,\n   this network may only support\
    \ data, but at many universities and\n   other organizations, the development\
    \ of a campus-wide network must\n   evolve to consider data, voice, and video\
    \ as the applications and\n   requirements of information technologies supported\
    \ by internetworking\n   technologies expand.\n   The Internet provides access\
    \ to a wide variety of resources and a\n   broad set of functions and services\
    \ which may or may not have been\n   available locally.  Support staff will require\
    \ education and training\n   to support and in turn train the faculty, other staff,\
    \ and students\n   in the use of the new technology and new resources made available.\n\
    \   This training may mean strategic re-orientation and deployment of\n   campus\
    \ networking information services.  The costs of such added-\n   value services\
    \ should be planned for in advance.\n   Increased use of the campus network will\
    \ make additional demands on\n   existing network technical staff.  Areas of the\
    \ institution not\n   currently participating in data network services will want\
    \ to\n   participate.  While not all of these services can be exactly\n   quantified\
    \ in terms of costs, they must be anticipated and\n   incorporated into campus\
    \ planning for an Internet connection.  These\n   areas may include libraries,\
    \ dormitories, student services, and data\n   depositories.\n   The implementation\
    \ of an Internet connection provides the impetus for\n   the development of a\
    \ campus-wide strategy for the use of information\n   technologies which may otherwise\
    \ have never been accessible.  It may\n   be difficult to quantify such benefits\
    \ but they must be included in\n   the justification process.  The benefits can\
    \ include access to\n   expensive, scientific instruments such as computational\
    \ services\n   (i.e., massively parallel supercomputers) or particle accelerators.\n\
    \   Clearly, this access means that the organization will have the use of\n  \
    \ these facilities without the cost of buying one, thus provide an\n   effective\
    \ recruiting tool for bright, young PHD's who require this\n   kind of resource.\n"

    \   the use of the campus net, but now extend to guidelines for the\n   appropriate\
    \ use of the Internet as well.  Appropriate use policy must\n   include policies\
    \ developed by the Internet community.  NSF has an\n   acceptable use policy which\
    \ applies to use of the backbone networks\n   they provide.  See Appendix B. \

- title: 4.3  IP Addresses and Domain Names
  contents:
  - "4.3  IP Addresses and Domain Names\n   Every organization connecting to the network\
    \ must have a unique\n   identifier.  This identifier is known as the campus IP\
    \ network\n   address.  In addition to a numerical identifier, most organizations\n\
    \   also get what is known as a domain name.  It is through the numerical\n  \
    \ address and the domain name that the organization's hosts will become\n   know\
    \ throughout the Internet.\n   An organization must register with the authority\
    \ that assigns a IP\n   addresses and for a domain name.  The IP address is assigned\
    \ by the\n   Internet Address Naming Authority (IANA).  The Domain Name is picked\n\
    \   by the organization.  A domain name is simply a character string that\n  \
    \ maps to the IP address.  It makes it easier for humans to remember\n   than\
    \ a unique set of numbers.  It is beyond the scope of this\n   document to include\
    \ a tutorial on IP addresses and domain names.  For\n   more information on IP\
    \ addresses and domain names, refer to Doug\n   Comer's textbook, \"Internetworking\
    \ with TCP/IP: Principles,\n   Protocols, and Architectures\" [3].  (See also\
    \ FYI 5, RFC 1178,\n   \"Choosing a Name for Your Computer\" [4].)\n   There are\
    \ different classes of Internet addresses, which correspond\n   to the number\
    \ of hosts an organization anticipates connecting to its\n   networks.  Thus the\
    \ campus should carefully consider the planned\n   growth of its own network in\
    \ applying for the appropriate class of\n   membership.  The IP service provider\
    \ is an excellent source of advice\n   in choosing a membership class.\n   At\
    \ this time, there is no cost associated with registration for IP\n   addresses\
    \ or domain names.\n   The actual procedure for applying for the IP address and\
    \ domain name\n   should be explained and is often provided to the connecting\n\
    \   organization by the IP service provider.\n"

- title: 4.5  Support
  contents:
  - "4.5  Support\n   Perhaps the most challenging task in the initial deployment\
    \ of the\n   Internet connection is the resulting reorientation of network\n \
    \  technical and network information services.  There are added\n   responsibilities\
    \ for network management as well as added network\n   information services to\
    \ support the connection.  Cognizant\n   administrators must recognize, plan and\
    \ budget for these added tasks.\n   Administration must also ensure that there\
    \ is a clear delineation of\n   duties among technical and network information\
    \ services staff to\n   avoid needless duplication of effort or conflict.\n  \
    \ Concurrent with the deployment of the network, the education of the\n   user\
    \ community is critical.  This includes creation of documentation\n   on basic\
    \ information about the Internet and specific campus resources\n   as well as\
    \ details on remote resources (library catalogs, information\n   servers, etc)\
    \ and how to use them.\n   Many organizations have already created excellent documentation\
    \ that\n   they are willing to share.  They generally only require attribution\n\
    \   in return for distribution rights (for educational purposes only).\n"
- title: 4.6  Training
  contents:
  - "4.6  Training\n   Networking problems experienced by end-users are often the\
    \ result of\n   mis-information or campus-specific configurations as opposed to\n\
    \   problems at the mid-level or backbone.  An investment in staff and\n   user\
    \ training and documentation at the beginning of the network\n   deployment is\
    \ an investment that will show a clear return in the long\n   term.\n   User training\
    \ is critical but depending on the size of the campus, it\n   is impossible to\
    \ expect the support staff to train users on an\n   individual basis.  Rather,\
    \ it's important to consider developing and\n   promoting a hierarchy of support\
    \ personal, so the central support\n   staff is actually training the trainers\
    \ who then go out and support\n   their particular group of users.\n   The most\
    \ critical course taught to users is on local information on\n   the basic functions\
    \ of the network, electronic mail, file transfer,\n   and remote login.  Good\
    \ documentation will help promote the\n   successful use of the network.  Documentation\
    \ should be clear,\n   concise and to the point.  During the training, it is important\
    \ to\n   address the most commonly asked questions first.\n"
- title: 4.7  Promotion
  contents:

    \ that is just learning.\n   Faculty involvement from the very beginning is vital.\
    \  It is\n   important to gain their support and to build on it.  Whether it is\n\

    \ and\n   relative ease of use of the network.  This ongoing maturation of the\n\
    \   network constitutes a vital service to the user community.\n   As the network\
    \ becomes a crucial tool in the user community's daily\n   routine, so does the\
    \ interface between the operations, information,\n   and user services staffs\
    \ and the end users gain in importance.\n   Responding to end-user problems with\

- title: 6.  Evaluation Strategies
  contents:
  - "6.  Evaluation Strategies\n   A system as complex and ubiquitous as the campus\
    \ data network\n   requires periodic review and evaluation.  As the campus network\n\
    \   provides the primary access to the larger Internet community,\n   evaluation\
    \ strategies must include analyses of how and where the\n   Internet is most heavily\
    \ used and how campus data flows might\n   optimize that traffic.\n   Evaluation\
    \ of network statistics provide key information on how the\n   network is used\
    \ and who is using it.  In turn, this must lead to\n   assessment mechanisms to\
    \ gauge user satisfaction with the network and\n   the tools used to make use\
    \ of the network.  At the base level, there\n   are the tools provided within\
    \ the network protocol itself -- Telnet,\n   FTP, SMTP mail -- that provide fundamental\
    \ access to the Internet.\n   But as campus use of the network and the Internet\
    \ matures, the campus\n   network community itself will build on those tools to\
    \ provide special\n   \"campus customized\" tools used on the network.  Network\
    \ services\n   should evaluate user needs and, where appropriate, design user\n\
    \   friendly interface mechanisms especially suited to special campus\n   area\
    \ needs.\n   While the use of quantitative methods of evaluation are important,\n\
    \   they can not replace qualitative methods.  If end-users are unhappy,\n   if\
    \ problems continue to be reported even though the statistics and\n   technical\
    \ monitors show few errors, organizations must recognize that\n   serious problems\
    \ do exist and take immediate action to resolve them.\n   The use of the Internet\
    \ itself and its impact on campus research and\n   instruction goals must be reviewed\
    \ and evaluated.  The introduction\n   of new technology inevitably involves reorientation\
    \ and new means of\n   communication.  While this should be a benefit to the campus\n\
    \   community as a whole, the new technologies may leave some segments of\n  \
    \ the community disoriented.  A careful evaluation of the impact of\n   this new\
    \ technology should determine not only which areas of campus\n   benefit from\
    \ Internet participation, but also which areas are not\n   benefitting from the\
    \ new technology.  Planning strategies should\n   include special attention to\
    \ areas not making use of network\n   resources to make those areas aware of the\
    \ potential benefits and to\n   provide training in the use of the network.  In\
    \ summary,\n   universities, schools, colleges and institutions in the Internet\n\
    \   community must incorporate a mechanism to evaluate both hidden\n   benefits\
    \ as well as hidden costs of that participation.\n"

- title: 10.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   Institutions who wish to connect to the Internet\
    \ should be aware that\n   the Internet network is, by nature, and open network.\
    \  As such,\n   connecting institutions must make sure that security mechanisms\
    \ are\n   in force on their own campus network to ensure that unauthorized or\n\
    \   inappropriate use of campus resources is not exploited by either the\n   internal\
    \ campus or by the external Internet community.  Moreover, it\n   is incumbent\
    \ on the institution to ensure that the campus community\n   is aware of the proper\
    \ use of the Internet.  The institution bears\n   the responsibility to educate\
    \ its users on the appropriate use of\n   campus systems within the context of\
    \ proper and ethical use of the\n   Internet.\n   An assessment of security on\
    \ the campus network prior to connecting\n   to the Internet should ensure that\
    \ all required security patches are\n   installed on all campus connected systems\
    \ as well as on the campus\n   network.  Systems with sensitive data or information\
    \ should be\n   physically secure as well as up to date with software security\n\
    \   patches.  In so far as possible, network addressable devices should\n   be\
    \ secure.  Changes to these devices should only be effected by\n   authorized\
    \ network management personnel to avoid potential security\n   risks.\n   For\
    \ more information on security issues, refer to FYI 8, RFC 1244,\n   \"Site Security\
    \ Handbook\" [1].\n   In summary, it is only the cooperation and attention of\
    \ each\n   connecting institution on the Internet to security issues that will\n\
    \   ensure the security of the Internet as a whole.\n"
