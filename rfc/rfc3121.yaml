  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a URN (Uniform Resource Name) namespace\
    \ that\n   is engineered by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured\n\
    \   Information Standards (OASIS) for naming persistent resources\n   published\
    \ by OASIS (such as OASIS Standards, XML (Extensible Markup\n   Language) Document\
    \ Type Definitions, XML Schemas, Namespaces,\n   Stylesheets, and other documents).\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information\n\
    \   Standards (OASIS) produces many kinds of documents: specifications,\n   working\
    \ drafts, technical resolutions, schemas, stylesheets, etc.\n   OASIS wishes to\
    \ provide global, distributed, persistent, location-\n   independent names for\
    \ these resources.\n   The Extensible Markup Language (XML) requires that all\
    \ resources\n   provide a system identifier, which must be a URI, in addition\
    \ to an\n   optional public identifier (which provides an alternate mechanism\
    \ for\n   constructing identifiers) and many evolving specifications require\n\
    \   authors to identify documents by URI alone (XML Namespaces, XML\n   Schema,\
    \ XSLT, etc.).\n   Motivated by these observations, OASIS would like to assign\
    \ URNs to\n   some resources in order to retain unique, permanent location-\n\
    \   independent names for them.\n   This namespace specification is for a formal\
    \ namespace.\n"

    \ 667 5115\n   Declaration of structure:\n      The Namespace Specific String\
    \ (NSS) of all URNs assigned by OASIS\n      will have the following hierarchical\
    \ structure:\n      There are two branches at the top of the hierarchy: \"names\"\
    \ and\n      \"member\".\n   The Names Hierarchy\n      The NSS in the names hierarchy\
    \ begins with a document class\n      identifier.  There are three classes of\
    \ identifiers:\n      \"specification\", \"tc\", and \"technical\".\n      Specifications\n\
    \         The \"specification\" hierarchy is for OASIS Specifications.  The\n\
    \         general structure of the NSS in the specification hierarchy has\n  \
    \       the form:\n            urn:oasis:names:specification:{specification-id}\n\
    \                           :{type}{:subtype}?:{document-id}\n         where \"\
    specification-id\" is a unique identifier for the\n         specification, \"\
    type\" identifies the document type (document,\n         schema, stylesheet, entity,\
    \ xmlns, etc.), the optional\n         \"subtype\" provides additional information\
    \ about the document\n         type (for example, stylesheet or schema language),\
    \ and\n         \"document-id\" is a unique identifier for the document.\n   \
    \      The Director of Technical Operations at OASIS assigns document\n      \
    \   types, subtypes, and all unique identifiers.\n      Technical Committee Work\
    \ Products\n         The \"tc\" hierarchy is for work products of OASIS Technical\n\
    \         Committees.  The general structure of the NSS in the tc\n         hierarchy\
    \ has the form:\n            urn:oasis:names:tc:{tc-id}:{type}{:subtype}?:{document-id}\n\
    \         where \"tc-id\" is a unique identifier for the Technical\n         Committee,\
    \ and the remaining fields are assigned as per the\n         specification hierarchy.\n\
    \      Technical Papers\n         The \"technical\" hierarchy identifies legacy\
    \ documents\n         (Technical Notes, Resolutions, Memoranda, and Research Papers).\n\
    \         The general structure of the NSS in the \"technical\" hierarchies\n\
    \         has the form:\n            urn:oasis:names:technical:{document-type}\n\
    \                           :{document-id}:{amendment-id}\n         The document\
    \ type is one of the following: \"note\",\n         \"resolution\", \"memorandum\"\
    , or \"researchpaper\".\n         The document and amendment identifiers are derived\
    \ from the\n         legacy system for naming these documents.  The document\n\
    \         identifier consists of a two digit year and a sequential\n         number,\
    \ the amendment identifier is the year of the amendment.\n      The Members Hierarchy\n\
    \         The NSS in the members hierarchy begins with a unique member\n     \
    \    identifier assigned by OASIS.  The string following the member\n        \
    \ identifier is opaque.  For example:\n            urn:oasis:member:A00024:x\n\
    \         The member identifiers will be assigned by The Director of\n       \
    \  Technical Operations at OASIS.  The opaque string is defined by\n         the\
    \ owner of the branch that begins with\n         \"urn:oasis:member:{member-id}:\"\
    .\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n      None\n   Identifier uniqueness\
    \ considerations:\n      Identifier uniqueness will be enforced by the Director\
    \ of\n      Technical Operations who assigns unique identifiers to all\n     \
    \ documents identified by URN.\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n  \
    \    OASIS is committed to maintaining the accessibility and\n      persistence\
    \ of all the resources that are assigned URNs.\n   Process of identifier assignment:\n\
    \      Assignment is limited to the owner and those authorities that are\n   \
    \   specifically designated by the owner.  OASIS will assign portions\n      of\
    \ its namespace (specifically, those under the members hierarchy)\n      for assignment\
    \ by other parties.\n   Process of identifier resolution:\n      The owner will\
    \ distribute catalogs (OASIS TR9401 Catalogs) that\n      map the assigned URNs\
    \ to resource identifiers (e.g., URLs).  A\n      more interactive, online resolution\
    \ system will also be deployed\n      in the near future.\n      The owner will\
    \ authorize additional resolution services as\n      appropriate.\n   Rules for\
    \ Lexical Equivalence:\n      URNs are lexically equivalent if they are lexically\
    \ identical.\n   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n      No special considerations.\n\
    \   Validation mechanism:\n      None specified.  The owner will publish OASIS\
    \ TR9401 Catalogs.\n      The presence of a URN in a catalog indicates that it\
    \ is valid.\n   Scope:\n      Global\n"
