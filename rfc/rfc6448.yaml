- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   There are applications that need to transfer Kerberos credentials\n\
    \   between them without having a prior relationship with established\n   Kerberos\
    \ keys.  When transferred over a transport that provides\n   confidentiality and\
    \ integrity, the unencrypted form of the KRB-CRED\n   message MAY be used.  One\
    \ application employing this method is the\n   Kerberos attribute transport mechanism,\
    \ described in Section 2.7 of\n   the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)\
    \ V2.0 Kerberos Attribute\n   Profile [SAMLv2-KRB-ATTRIB].\n   In the SAML application,\
    \ the Identity Provider (IdP) somehow obtains\n   a Kerberos service ticket from\
    \ the Kerberos Key Distribution Center\n   (KDC) when required by the SAML system\
    \ and transfers the credential\n   to a Service Provider (SP) within an attribute\
    \ statement.  The SP can\n   then use the credential to access a Kerberos protected\
    \ service.\n   The Kerberos 5 specification as described in [RFC4120] mentions\
    \ the\n   non-standard legacy use of unencrypted KRB-CRED messages with the\n\
    \   Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)\n   [RFC1964]\
    \ by the MIT, Heimdal, and Microsoft Kerberos\n   implementations.  This document\
    \ provides a formal specification of\n   the unencrypted form of the KRB-CRED\
    \ message to enable its continued\n   use in new applications.\n"

- title: 3.  The Unencrypted Form of the KRB-CRED Message
  contents:
  - "3.  The Unencrypted Form of the KRB-CRED Message\n   The unencrypted form of\
    \ the KRB-CRED message contains EncryptedData\n   as defined in Section 5.2.9\
    \ of [RFC4120].  The encryption type\n   (etype) MUST be specified as 0.  The\
    \ optional key version number\n   (kvno) SHOULD NOT be present and MUST be ignored\
    \ by the recipient if\n   present.  The ciphertext (cipher) is a copy of the EncKrbCredPart,\n\
    \   which is in cleartext, as defined in Section 5.8.1 of [RFC4120].\n"
- title: 4.  Kerberos Encryption Type 0 Is Not an Encryption System
  contents:
  - "4.  Kerberos Encryption Type 0 Is Not an Encryption System\n   The Kerberos Encryption\
    \ Type 0 is an invalid value [RFC3961].  This\n   means that no encryption type\
    \ with value 0 will ever be defined; no\n   encryption or key management operations\
    \ will use this value.  Layers\n   above the encryption layer often transport\
    \ encryption types as\n   integer values.  These layers are free to use a 0 in\
    \ an encryption\n   type integer as a flag or sentinel value, or for other context-\n\
    \   specific purposes.  For example, Section 3 of this specification\n   defines\
    \ the semantics of a 0 carried in the KRB-CRED message's\n   encryption type field.\
    \  In the context of the KRB-CRED message, it is\n   a message-specific indicator\
    \ to be interpreted as the message is not\n   encrypted.  This approach was chosen\
    \ due to existing Kerberos\n   implementations that conform to this specification.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The KRB-CRED message contains sensitive information\
    \ related to\n   Kerberos credentials being transferred, such as their secret\
    \ session\n   keys, client and server principal names, and validity period.\n\
    \   Possession of this information, along with the ticket itself, would\n   allow\
    \ an attacker to impersonate the client named in the ticket.  The\n   possibility\
    \ of modification of the KRB-CRED message enables the\n   attacker to substitute\
    \ the credentials.  This can result in the\n   recipient using the credentials\
    \ of a client that was not intended.\n   As a result, the KRB-CRED message must\
    \ be carefully safeguarded.\n   The use of an unencrypted form of the KRB-CRED\
    \ message MUST only be\n   used with a transport where sender and recipient identities\
    \ can be\n   established to be known to each other.  The transport MUST also\n\
    \   provide confidentiality, integrity, and mutual authentication.\n   Examples\
    \ of transports that MAY be securely used to transport an\n   unencrypted KRB-CRED\
    \ message would include Transport Layer Security\n   (TLS) [RFC5246], where mutual\
    \ authentication has been established, or\n   the use of messages where the KRB-CRED\
    \ is encoded within an encrypted\n   and signed SAML 2.0 [OASIS-SAMLv2] statement.\n"
