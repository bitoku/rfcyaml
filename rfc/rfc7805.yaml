- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   TCP has a long history.  Over time, many RFCs have accumulated\
    \ that\n   describe aspects of the TCP protocol, implementation, and extensions.\n\
    \   Some of these have been superseded, are no longer recommended for\n   use,\
    \ or have simply never seen widespread use.\n   Sections 6 and 7.1 of the TCP\
    \ roadmap document [RFC7414] already\n   reclassified a number of TCP extensions\
    \ as \"Historic\" and describes\n   the reasons for doing so, but it did not instruct\
    \ the RFC Editor to\n   change the status of these RFCs in the RFC database. \
    \ The purpose of\n   this document is to do just that.\n   In addition, this document\
    \ reclassifies all other documents mentioned\n   in the TCP roadmap that currently\
    \ have an \"Unknown\" status to either\n   \"Historic\" or \"Informational\".\n"
- title: 2.  Status Changes
  contents:
  - "2.  Status Changes\n   The following two sections give a short justification\
    \ why a specific\n   TCP extension or a TCP-related document is being reclassified\
    \ as\n   \"Historic\" or \"Informational\".  In addition, the letter code after\
    \ an\n   RFC number indicates from which original status a particular RFC is\n\
    \   changed to \"Historic\" or \"Informational\" (see BCP 9 [RFC2026] for an\n\
    \   explanation of these categories):\n      S - Standards Track (Proposed Standard,\
    \ Draft Standard, or\n      Internet Standard)\n      E - Experimental\n     \
    \ I - Informational\n      H - Historic\n      B - Best Current Practice\n   \
    \   U - Unknown (not formally defined)\n   For the content of the documents itself,\
    \ the reader is referred\n   either to the corresponding RFC or, for a brief description,\
    \ to the\n   TCP roadmap document [RFC7414].\n"
- title: 2.1.  Moving to "Historic" Status
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Moving to \"Historic\" Status\n   This document changes the status of the\
    \ following RFCs to \"Historic\"\n   [RFC2026]:\n   o  [RFC675]  U, \"Specification\
    \ of Internet Transmission Control\n      Program\" was replaced by the final\
    \ TCP specification [RFC793]\n   o  [RFC721]  U, \"Out-of-Band Control Signals\
    \ in a Host-to-Host\n      Protocol\" was a proposal that was not incorporated\
    \ into the final\n      TCP specification [RFC793]\n   o  [RFC761]  U, \"DoD Standard\
    \ Transmission Control Protocol\" was\n      replaced by the final TCP specification\
    \ [RFC793]\n   o  [RFC813]  U, \"Window and Acknowledgement Strategy in TCP\"\
    \ was\n      incorporated into [RFC1122]\n   o  [RFC816]  U, \"Fault Isolation\
    \ and Recovery\" was incorporated into\n      [RFC1122] and [RFC5461]\n   o  [RFC879]\
    \  U, \"The TCP Maximum Segment Size and Related Topics\" was\n      incorporated\
    \ into [RFC1122] and [RFC6691]\n   o  [RFC896]  U, \"Congestion Control in IP/TCP\
    \ Internetworks\" was\n      incorporated into [RFC1122] and [RFC6633]\n   o \
    \ [RFC1078] U, \"TCP Port Service Multiplexer (TCPMUX)\" should be\n      deprecated,\
    \ because:\n      *  It modifies the TCP connection establishment semantics by\
    \ also\n         completing the three-way handshake when a service is not\n  \
    \       available.\n      *  It requires all new connections to be received on\
    \ a single\n         port, which limits the number of connections between two\n\
    \         machines.\n      *  It complicates firewall implementation and management\
    \ because\n         all services share the same port number.\n      *  There are\
    \ very limited deployments, and these are not used in\n         an Internet context.\
    \  (The only reported use is for SGI's Data\n         Migration Facility in private\
    \ networks.)\n   o  [RFC6013] E, \"TCP Cookie Transactions (TCPCT)\" should be\n\
    \      deprecated (although only published in 2011) because:\n      *  It uses\
    \ the experimental TCP option codepoints, which prohibit\n         a large-scale\
    \ deployment.\n      *  [RFC7413] and [TCP-EDO] are alternatives that have more\
    \ \"rough\n         consensus and running code\" behind them.\n      *  There\
    \ are no known wide-scale deployments.\n"

    \ of the following RFCs to\n   \"Informational\" [RFC2026]:\n   o  [RFC700] U,\
    \ \"A Protocol Experiment\", which presents a field report\n      about the deployment\
    \ of a very early version of TCP\n   o  [RFC794]  U, \"Pre-emption\", which recommends\

    \ with the TCP retransmission timeout calculation\n   o  [RFC964]  U, \"Some Problems\
    \ with the Specification of the Military\n      Standard Transmission Control\

    \ MIL-STD-1778 document,\n      which was intended as a successor to [RFC793]\n\
    \   o  [RFC1071] U, \"Computing the Internet Checksum\", which lists a\n     \
