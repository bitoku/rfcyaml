  - "1.  Introduction\n   This specification defines the behavior required of Diameter\
    \ agents\n   to route requests when the User-Name Attribute Value Pair (AVP)\n\
    \   contains a Network Access Identifier (NAI) formatted with multiple\n   realms\
    \ (hereafter referred to as a Decorated NAI).  Decorated NAIs\n   are used in\
    \ order to force the routing of request messages through a\n   predefined list\
    \ of mediating realms.  This specification does not\n   define a new Diameter\
    \ application but instead defines behaviour that\n   would be common across all\
    \ new Diameter applications that require\n   request routing based on Decorated\
    \ NAI.\n   The Diameter Base Protocol [RFC3588] NAI usage is originally based\
    \ on\n   [RFC2486], which has since been revised to [RFC4282].  While the use\n\
    \   of multiple realms is generally discouraged, RFC 4282 does allow\n   multiple\
    \ realms.  The use of this facility appears in, for instance,\n   [RFC4284]. \
    \ However, RFC 4282 does not define how the Decorated NAIs\n   should be handled\
    \ by Diameter agents, so this specification was\n   written to capture those requirements.\n"

- title: 3.  Problem Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Problem Overview\n   Section 6.1 of \"The Diameter Base Protocol\" (RFC 3588)\
    \ defines the\n   request routing in detail.  That specification concerns only\
    \ the\n   cases where a Destination-Realm AVP is included in a Diameter request\n\
    \   message.  As described in RFC 3588 Section 6.1, a Diameter peer\n   originating\
    \ a request message MAY retrieve the realm information from\n   the User-Name\
    \ AVP and use that realm to populate the Destination-\n   Realm AVP.  In that\
    \ case, the User-Name AVP is in form of an NAI\n   including the realm part.\n\
    \   Decorated NAIs are used to force routing of messages through a\n   predefined\
    \ list of realms and, in that way, force certain inter-realm\n   roaming arrangements;\
    \ see Section 2.7 of RFC 4282.  For example, a\n   terminal (e.g., a mobile host)\
    \ may learn, based on some application-\n   or implementation-specific manner,\
    \ that its network access\n   authentication signaling must traverse certain realms\
    \ in order to\n   reach the home realm.  In this case, the terminal would decorate\
    \ its\n   NAI during the network access authentication with the list of\n   intermediating\
    \ realms and the home realm.  As a result, the network\n   access server (NAS)\
    \ and intermediating Diameter agents would make\n   sure that all Diameter request\
    \ messages traverse through the desired\n   realms as long as the request messages\
    \ contain the User-Name AVP with\n   a Decorated NAI.\n   NAI decoration has previously\
    \ been used in RADIUS-based [RFC2865]\n   roaming networks, using RFC 2486 NAIs\
    \ in a proprietary manner.  There\n   is a need to replicate the same NAI-based\
    \ routing enforcement\n   functionality in Diameter-based roaming networks.  Moreover,\
    \ there\n   are publicly available specifications (e.g., see [3GPP.23.234],\n\
    \   [3GPP.24.234], [3GPP.23.003], [3GPP.29.273], and [WiMAX]) that assume\n  \
    \ NAI-decoration-based request routing enforcement is fully supported\n   by RFC\
    \ 3588.  The same assumption is carried over to Network Server\n   Application\
    \ Requirements (NASREQ) [RFC4005] and Extensible\n   Authentication Protocol (EAP)\
    \ [RFC4072] Diameter applications.\n   Figure 1 illustrates an example deployment\
    \ scenario where Decorated\n   NAIs would be used to force a certain route through\
    \ desired realms.\n   A roaming terminal (e.g., a mobile host) discovers a number\
    \ of\n   Network Access Providers (NAP): NAP A and NAP B.  None of the NAPs\n\
    \   are able to provide direct connectivity to the roaming terminal's\n   home\
    \ realm (i.e., h.example.com).  However, the roaming terminal\n   learns, somehow,\
    \ that NAP B is able to provide connectivity to\n   h.example.com through x.example.com\
    \ (i.e., the visited realm from the\n   roaming terminal point of view).  During\
    \ the network access\n   authentication, the roaming terminal would decorate its\
    \ NAI as\n   h.example.com!username@x.example.com.  The roaming terminal has also\n\
    \   an alternative route to its home realm through NAP A: z.example.com\n   and\
    \ x.example.com.  If the roaming terminal were to choose to use NAP\n   A, then\
    \ it would decorate its NAI as\n   x.example.com!h.example.com!username@z.example.com.\
    \  Diameter agents\n   would now be able to route the request message through\
    \ desired realms\n   using the Decorated NAI originally found in the User-Name\
    \ AVP.\n         .--.                  .--.                    .--.\n       _(.\

    \ to the network access authentication\n   and authorization procedures.  It can\
    \ be used with any Diameter\n   application whose commands are proxiable and include\
    \ the User-Name\n   AVP with an NAI.  Generally, the NAI decoration can be used\
    \ to force\n   a certain route for all Diameter request messages at a realm\n\
    \   granularity.\n   As a problem summary, we have two main issues:\n   o  Updating\
    \ both Destination-Realm and User-Name AVPs based on the\n      Decorated NAI\
    \ extracted from the User-Name AVP.  The update would\n      be done by intermediating\
    \ Diameter agents that participate in\n      realm-based request routing.  Specifically,\
    \ this would concern\n      Diameter proxies.\n   o  How Diameter agents could\
    \ implement the handling of the NAI-\n      decoration-based routing enforcement\
    \ in a way that is still\n      backwards compatible with RFC 3588.\n   Section\
    \ 2.3 of [RFC5113] also discusses NAI-decoration-related issues\n   with EAP [RFC3748]\
    \ in general.\n"

    \ to separate\n   realms in the list of decorated realms in the NAI (as shown\
    \ in\n   examples in [RFC4282]).\n"
- title: 4.2.  Internationalization of Decorated NAIs
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Internationalization of Decorated NAIs\n   RFC 3588, Section 1.3 states\
    \ that NAI realm names are required to be\n   unique and are piggybacked on the\
    \ administration of the Domain Name\n   System (DNS) ([RFC1034], [RFC1035]) namespace.\
    \  However, an NAI, with\n   or without decoration, may contain international\
    \ characters as\n   allowed by RFC 4282.  This causes problems, as international\n\
    \   characters as such are not supported by RFC 1034 and RFC 1035.  The\n   conversion\
    \ of International Domain Names (IDN), which in this\n   document's scope are\
    \ NAI realms, are discussed in [RFC3490] and are\n   further to be revised in\
    \ [IDNA].\n   The general guidance for handling NAI realms with international\n\
    \   characters is described in Section 2.4 of RFC 4282 and discussed more\n  \
    \ in [NAI] based on recent operational experiences.  This specification\n   does\
    \ not attempt to fix the issue with the internationalization of\n   NAIs, as the\
    \ problem space is large and concerns much more than just\n   NAI realms and NAI\
    \ decoration.  However, this specification has the\n   following assumptions:\n\
    \   o  The conversion from a realm name that includes international\n      characters\
    \ to ASCII-compatible encoding should only take place\n      when DNS infrastructure\
    \ needs to be queried and not, for example,\n      during the realm-placement\
    \ processing of Decorated NAIs.  The\n      conversion is normally handled by\
    \ a DNS resolver library on the\n      local Diameter agent or, when not available\
    \ in the resolver\n      library, by the Diameter agent.  In both cases, the realm\
    \ in the\n      NAI remains unchanged.\n   o  It is the responsibility of the\
    \ operators administrating their\n      realm and domain name spaces to ensure\
    \ that the DNS is provisioned\n      properly for all realms that may appear in\
    \ Decorated NAIs.  This\n      implicitly requires that the conversion from any\
    \ realm with\n      international characters to a domain name cannot fail (i.e.,\
    \ the\n      realms conform to the preconditions for internationalized domain\n\
    \      names).\n   From the above discussion, it can be concluded that avoiding\n\
    \   international characters in realms contained in NAIs is the best way\n   to\
    \ avoid problems with internationalized domain names and Decorated\n   NAI handling\
    \ in general.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.3.  Ensuring Backwards Compatibility\n   The handling of the NAI-decoration-based\
    \ routing enforcement as\n   described in this specification will be supported\
    \ by any new Diameter\n   application.  Therefore, backwards compatibility with\
    \ existing\n   Diameter implementations, applications, and deployments will be\n\
    \   guaranteed.  Existing Diameter agents not compliant with this\n   specification\
    \ will not advertise support for these new applications\n   that implement the\
    \ enhanced routing solution based on Decorated NAIs,\n   and will therefore be\
    \ bypassed.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Enhanced Request Routing Solution
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Enhanced Request Routing Solution\n   When a Diameter client originates\
    \ a request message, the\n   Destination-Realm AVP is populated with the realm\
    \ part of the NAI\n   available in the User-Name AVP (the realm given after the\
    \ '@'\n   character of the NAI).  The NAI in the User-Name AVP may or may not\n\
    \   be decorated.\n   When a Diameter agent receives a request message containing\
    \ the\n   Destination-Realm AVP with a realm that the agent is configured to\n\
    \   process locally (and, in the case of proxies, the Diameter\n   application\
    \ is locally supported), it MUST do the following further\n   processing before\
    \ handling the message locally:\n   o  If the User-Name AVP is available in the\
    \ request message, then the\n      Diameter agent MUST inspect whether the User-Name\
    \ AVP contains a\n      Decorated NAI.  If the NAI is not decorated, then the\
    \ Diameter\n      agent proceeds with a normal RFC 3588 message processing.\n\
    \   o  If the User-Name AVP contains a Decorated NAI, then the Diameter\n    \
    \  agent MUST process the NAI as defined in RFC 4282 and update the\n      value\
    \ of the User-Name AVP accordingly.  Furthermore, the Diameter\n      agent MUST\
    \ update the Destination-Realm AVP to match the new realm\n      in the User-Name\
    \ AVP.\n   o  The request message is then sent to the next hop using the normal\n\
    \      request routing rules as defined in RFC 3588.\n   Figure 2 illustrates\
    \ an example of a roaming terminal that originates\n   signaling with the home\
    \ realm (h.example.com), through a NAP and two\n   intermediating realms (z.example.com,\
    \ x.example.com) before reaching\n   the home realm (h.example.com).  The example\
    \ shows how the User-Name\n   AVP and the Destination-Realm AVP change at each\
    \ realm before\n   reaching the final destination.  If the signaling were originated\n\
    \   from the NAS/NAP only, then step 1 can be omitted.\n   1) Roaming Terminal\

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   A malicious node initiating (or indirectly causing\
