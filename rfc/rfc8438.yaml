  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document extends the Internet Message Access Protocol
    (IMAP)\n   [IMAP4rev1] with a new capability called \"STATUS=SIZE\".  To determine\n
    \  the total storage size of a mailbox, an IMAP client currently needs\n   to
    retrieve all message sizes individually using the FETCH command\n   with the RFC822.SIZE
    data item.  The STATUS=SIZE capability provides\n   a more efficient means of
    achieving this.  It extends the STATUS\n   command with a new \"SIZE\" data item,
    which indicates the total size\n   of all messages in the target mailbox.  This
    way, this information\n   can be queried with just one STATUS command.  When the
    LIST-STATUS\n   IMAP capability [LIST-STATUS] is also available, the SIZE data
    item\n   can be queried for many mailboxes at once using just one LIST\n   command.\n
    \  This capability is particularly useful for IMAP clients that do not\n   cache
    the state of the message store, such as most webmail clients.\n   Without the
    \"STATUS=SIZE\" capability, such clients need to fetch all\n   message sizes from
    the server when the size of an individual mailbox\n   needs to be determined.
    \ For example, a user may request detailed\n   quota usage information for each
    mailbox to find out which specific\n   mailboxes consume most of the available
    storage resources.  Using\n   this information, the user can get an overview of
    which mailboxes\n   need to be cleaned up to reduce quota usage.  The QUOTA capability\n
    \  [QUOTA] is no help in that scenario, since the provided QUOTAROOT\n   command
    can only yield the STORAGE resource usage of a whole quota\n   root, not each
    individual mailbox within that root.\n"

    sent by a client that is connected\n   to a server.  \"S:\" indicates lines sent
    by the server to the client.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT
    RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in\n   BCP 14 [KEYWORDS] [KEYWORDS2] when, and only when, they appear
    in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"

  - "3.  STATUS Command and Response Extensions\n   This extension defines one new
    status data item for the STATUS\n   command and response:\n   SIZE\n      The
    total size of the mailbox in octets.  This is not strictly\n      required to
    be an exact value, but it MUST be equal to or greater\n      than the sum of the
    values of the RFC822.SIZE FETCH message data\n      item [IMAP4rev1] of all messages
    in the mailbox.  When the QUOTA\n      capability [QUOTA] is also supported, this
    value SHOULD be equal\n      to the storage usage value used to enforce the STORAGE
    resource\n      limit for this mailbox.  This way, the client can directly infer\n
    \     the quota usage.\n   Since the total storage size of a mailbox can easily
    exceed 4 GB,\n   clients MUST be capable of receiving 63-bit SIZE data item values.\n
    \  The message size is chosen to be at most 63 bits wide rather than 64\n   bits
    to make implementations on various platforms (such as Java)\n   easier.\n   Example:\n
    \  C: A01 STATUS frop (MESSAGES SIZE UIDNEXT)\n   S: * STATUS frop (MESSAGES 8
    SIZE 44421 UIDNEXT 242344)\n   S: A01 OK STATUS completed\n   The same information
    can be obtained by using the following commands,\n   albeit less efficiently:\n
    \  C: A02 SELECT \"frop\"\n   S: * FLAGS (\\Answered \\Flagged \\Deleted \\Seen
    \\Draft)\n   S: * 8 EXISTS\n   S: * 1 RECENT\n   S: * OK [UNSEEN 7] First unseen.\n
    \  S: * OK [UIDVALIDITY 1364851417] UIDs valid\n   S: * OK [UIDNEXT 242344] Predicted
    next UID\n   S: * OK [HIGHESTMODSEQ 3914] Highest\n   S: A02 OK [READ-WRITE] Select
    completed.\n   C: A03 FETCH 1:* (RFC822.SIZE)\n   S: * 1 FETCH (RFC822.SIZE 3224)\n
    \  S: * 2 FETCH (RFC822.SIZE 1222)\n   S: * 3 FETCH (RFC822.SIZE 444)\n   S: *
    4 FETCH (RFC822.SIZE 4516)\n   S: * 5 FETCH (RFC822.SIZE 544)\n   S: * 6 FETCH
    (RFC822.SIZE 922)\n   S: * 7 FETCH (RFC822.SIZE 31126)\n   S: * 8 FETCH (RFC822.SIZE
    2423)\n   S: A03 OK Fetch completed.\n   When the LIST-STATUS IMAP capability
    [LIST-STATUS] is also available,\n   the STATUS command can be combined with the
    LIST command to further\n   improve efficiency.  This way, the sizes of many mailboxes
    can be\n   queried with just one LIST command.\n   Example:\n   C: A04 LIST \"\"
    % RETURN (STATUS (MESSAGES SIZE))\n   S: * LIST () \".\" \"INBOX\"\n   S: * STATUS
    \"INBOX\" (MESSAGES 17 SIZE 16234)\n   S: * LIST () \".\" \"frop\"\n   S: * STATUS
    \"frop\" (MESSAGES 8 SIZE 44421)\n   S: A04 OK List completed.\n"
