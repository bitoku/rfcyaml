Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects to configure the Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) identifiers for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and the MPLS based Transport Profile (TP).
This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects for modeling a Transport Profile (TP) based on Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) [RFC3031].
This MIB module should be used for performing the OAM (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance) operations for MPLS Tunnel LSPs (Label Switched Paths), Pseudowires, and Sections.
At the time of this writing, SNMP SET is no longer recommended as a way to configure MPLS networks as was described in [RFC3812].
However, since the MIB modules specified in this document are intended to work in parallel with the MIB modules for MPLS specified in [RFC3812], certain objects defined here are specified with a MAX ACCESS of read write or read create so that specifications of the base tables in [RFC3812] and the new MIB modules in this document are consistent.
Although the example described in Section 6 specifies means to configure OAM identifiers for MPLS TP Tunnels, this should be seen as indicating how the MIB values would be returned in the specified circumstances having been configured by alternative means.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580

The MPLS transport profile OAM identifiers MIB module is designed to satisfy the following requirements and constraints:
The MIB module supports configuration of OAM identifiers for MPLS point to point Tunnels, point to multipoint LSPs, co routed bidirectional LSPs, associated bidirectional LSPs, and Pseudowires.
Brief Description of MIB Objects
The objects described in this section support the functionality described in [RFC5654] and [RFC6370].
The tables support both IP compatible and ICC
based OAM identifiers configurations for MPLS Tunnels, LSPs, and Pseudowires.
The mplsOamIdMegTable is used to manage one or more Maintenance Entities (MEs) that belong to the same transport path.
When a new entry is created with mplsOamIdMegOperatorType set to ipCompatible (1), then as per [RFC6370] (MEG ID for an LSP is LSP ID, and MEG ID for a PW is PW Path ID), MEP ID can be automatically formed.
For an ICC based transport path, the user is expected to configure the ICC identifier explicitly in this table for MPLS Tunnels, LSPs, and Pseudowires.
The mplsOamIdMeTable defines a relationship between two points (source and sink) of a transport path to which maintenance and monitoring operations apply.
The two points that define an ME are called Maintenance Entity Group End Points (MEPs).
In between MEPs, there are zero or more intermediate points, called Maintenance Entity Group Intermediate Points (MIPs).
MEPs and MIPs are associated with the MEG and can be shared by more than one ME in a MEG.
MPLS OAM Identifier Configuration for MPLS LSP:
In this section, we provide an example of the OAM identifier configuration for an MPLS co routed bidirectional LSP.
This example provides usage of MEG and ME tables for management and monitoring operations of an MPLS LSP.
This example considers the OAM identifiers configuration on a head end LSR to manage and monitor an MPLS LSP.
Only relevant objects that are applicable for IP based OAM identifiers of MPLS
co routed bidirectional LSPs are illustrated here.
This will create an entry in the mplsOamIdMegTable to manage and monitor the MPLS Tunnel.
The following ME table is used to associate the path information to a MEG.
The source MEP ID is derived from the IP compatible MPLS
RowPointer MUST point to the first accessible column of an    MPLS LSP

"This object contains an unused value for mplsOamIdMegIndex, or a zero to indicate that none exist.
Negative values are not allowed, as they do not correspond to valid values of mplsOamIdMegIndex."
"This table contains information about the Maintenance Entity Groups (MEGs).
A MEG, as mentioned in the MPLS TP OAM framework, defines a set of one or more Maintenance Entities (MEs).
MEs define a relationship between any two points of a transport path in an OAM domain to which maintenance and monitoring operations apply."
"An entry in this table represents an MPLS TP MEG.
An entry can be created by a network administrator or by an SNMP agent as instructed by an MPLS TP OAM framework.
When a new entry is created with mplsOamIdMegOperatorType set to ipCompatible (1), then as per RFC 6370 (MEG ID for an LSP is LSP ID, and MEG ID for a PW is PW Path ID), MEP ID can be automatically formed.
For a co routed bidirectional LSP, MEG ID is A1 {Global ID::Node
For an associated bidirectional LSP, MEG ID is A1 {Global ID::Node ID::Tunnel Num::LSP Num}:: Z9 {Global ID::Node ID::Tunnel Num::LSP Num}.
For an LSP, MEP ID is formed using Global ID::Node ID::Tunnel Num::LSP Num.
For a PW, MEG ID is formed using AGI:: A1 {Global ID::Node ID::AC ID}:: Z9 {Global ID::Node ID::AC ID}.
For a PW, MEP ID is formed using AGI::Global ID::Node
MEP ID is retrieved from the mplsOamIdMegServicePointer object based on the mplsOamIdMegServicePointerType value.
The ICC MEG ID for an LSP and a PW is formed using the objects mplsOamIdMegIdIcc and mplsOamIdMegIdUmc.
MEP ID can be formed using MEG ID::MEP Index.

The value up (1) indicates that the MEG and its monitored path are operationally up.
The value down (2) indicates that the MEG is operationally down.
When the value of mplsOamIdMegOperStatus is up (1), all the bits of mplsOamIdMegSubOperStatus must be cleared.
When the value of mplsOamIdMegOperStatus is down (2), at least one bit of mplsOamIdMegSubOperStatus must be set."

"This object contains an unused value for mplsOamIdMeMpIndex, or a zero to indicate that none exist.
Negative values are not allowed, as they do not correspond to valid values of mplsOamIdMeMpIndex."
"This table contains MPLS TP ME information.
The ME is some portion of a transport path that requires management bounded by two points (called MEPs), and the relationship between those points to which maintenance and monitoring operations apply.
This table is generic enough to handle MEP and MIP information within a MEG."
An entry in this table represents an MPLS TP ME.
This entry represents the ME if the source and sink MEPs are defined.
An ME is a point to point entity.
One ME has two such MEPs.
A MEG is a group of one or more MEs.
One MEG can have two or more MEPs.
For a point to point LSP, one MEG has one ME, and this ME is associated with two MEPs (source and sink MEPs) within a MEG.
Each mplsOamIdMeIndex value denotes the ME within a MEG.
In the case of unidirectional point to point transport paths, a single unidirectional ME is defined to monitor it, and mplsOamIdMeServicePointer points to a unidirectional point to point path.
In the case of associated bidirectional point to point transport paths, two independent unidirectional MEs are defined to independently monitor each direction, and each mplsOamIdMeServicePointer MIB object points to a unique unidirectional transport path.
This has implications for transactions that terminate at or query a MIP, as a return path from a MIP to a source MEP does not necessarily exist within the MEG.
In the case of co routed bidirectional point to point transport paths, a single bidirectional ME is defined to monitor both directions congruently, and the mplsOamIdMeServicePointer MIB object points to a co routed bidirectional point to point transport path.
In the case of unidirectional point to multipoint transport paths, a single unidirectional ME for each leaf is defined to monitor the transport path from the root to that leaf, and each leaf has different transport path information in the mplsOamIdMeServicePointer MIB object.
Note that the MplsOamIdMeEntry should be created manually once the MEG is configured for OAM operations.
"Uniquely identifies an ME index within a MEG.
Managers should obtain new values for row creation in this table by reading mplsOamIdMeIndexNext."
MAX ACCESS    not accessible STATUS

"This object denotes the ME name.
Each ME has a unique name within a MEG."
If the mplsOamIdMegMpLocation object value is perNode (1), the MP interface index should point to the incoming interface or outgoing interface, or be zero (to indicate that the MP OAM packets are initiated from the forwarding engine).
If the mplsOamIdMegMpLocation object value is perInterface (2), the MP interface index should point to the incoming interface or outgoing interface."

"Indicates the source MEP index of the ME.
This object should be configured if the mplsOamIdMegOperatorType object in the mplsOamIdMegEntry is configured as iccBased (2).
If the MEG is configured for an IP based operator, the value of this object should be set to zero, and the MEP ID will be automatically derived from the service identifiers (MPLS TP LSP/PW Identifier).
"Indicates the sink MEP index of the ME.
This object should be configured if the mplsOamIdMegOperatorType object in the mplsOamIdMegEntry is configured as iccBased (2).
If the MEG is configured for an IP based operator, the value of this object should be set to zero, and the MEP ID will be automatically derived from the service identifiers (MPLS TP LSP/PW Identifier).
"Indicates the MP type within the MEG.
The object should have the value mep (1) only in the ingress or egress nodes of the transport path.
The object can have the value mip (2) in the intermediate nodes and possibly in the egress nodes of the transport path."
"Indicates the direction of the MEP.
This object should be configured if mplsOamIdMeMpType is configured as mep (1); otherwise, notApplicable (3) is set.
"This variable represents a pointer to the MPLS TP transport path.

This MIB relates to a system that will provide network connectivity and packet forwarding services.
As such, improper manipulation of the objects represented by this MIB may result in denial of service to a large number of end users.
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection opens devices to attack.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: The mplsOamIdMegTable and the mplsOamIdMeTable collectively show the MPLS OAM characteristics.
If an administrator does not want to reveal this information, then these tables should be considered sensitive/vulnerable.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for authentication and privacy via the User based Security Model (USM)
[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
As described in [RFC4221] and [RFC6639], and as requested in the MPLS TC STD MIB [RFC3811], MPLS related Standards Track MIB modules should be rooted under the mplsStdMIB subtree.
The following subsection lists a new assignment that has been made by IANA under the mplsStdMIB subtree for the MPLS OAM ID STD MIB module defined in this document.
New assignments can only be made via a Standards Action as specified in [RFC5226].
IANA Considerations for MPLS OAM ID STD MIB IANA has to assign the OID { mplsStdMIB 21 } to the MPLS OAM ID STD MIB module specified in this document.
