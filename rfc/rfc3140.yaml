  - "1. Introduction\n   Differentiated Services [RFC 2474, RFC 2475] introduces the
    notion of\n   Per Hop Behaviors (PHBs) that define how traffic belonging to a\n
    \  particular behavior aggregate is treated at an individual network\n   node.
    \ In IP packet headers, PHBs are not indicated as such; instead\n   Differentiated
    Services Codepoint (DSCP) values are used.  There are\n   only 64 possible DSCP
    values, but there is no such limit on the\n   number of PHBs.  In a given network
    domain, there is a locally\n   defined mapping between DSCP values and PHBs.  Standardized
    PHBs\n   recommend a DSCP mapping, but network operators may choose\n   alternative
    mappings.\n   In some cases it is necessary or desirable to identify a particular\n
    \  PHB in a protocol message, such as a message negotiating bandwidth\n   management
    or path selection, especially when such messages pass\n   between management domains.
    \ Examples where work is in progress\n   include communication between bandwidth
    brokers, and MPLS support of\n   diffserv.\n   In certain cases, what needs to
    be identified is not an individual\n   PHB, but a set of PHBs.  One example is
    a set of PHBs that must\n   follow the same physical path to prevent re-ordering.
    \ An instance of\n   this is the set of three PHBs belonging to a single Assured\n
    \  Forwarding class, such as the PHBs AF11, AF12 and AF13 [RFC 2597].\n   This
    document defines a binary encoding to uniquely identify PHBs\n   and/or sets of
    PHBs in protocol messages.  This encoding MUST be used\n   when such identification
    is required.\n   This document replaces RFC 2836, which omitted considerations
    for the\n   Class Selector codepoints.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",
    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described
    in [RFC2119].\n"

    - "1.1. Usage Scenarios\n   Diffserv services are expected to be supported over
      various\n   underlying technologies which we broadly refer to as \"link layers\"\n
      \  for the purpose of this discussion.  For the transport of IP packets,\n   some
      of these link layers make use of connections or logical\n   connections where
      the forwarding behavior supported by each link\n   layer device is a property
      of the connection.  In particular, within\n   the link layer domain, each link
      layer node will schedule traffic\n   depending on which connection the traffic
      is transported in.\n   Examples of such \"link layers\" include ATM and MPLS.\n
      \  For efficient support of diffserv over these link layers, one model\n   is
      for different Behavior Aggregates (BAs) (or sets of Behavior\n   Aggregates)
      to be transported over different connections so that they\n   are granted different
      (and appropriate) forwarding behaviors inside\n   the link layer cloud.  When
      those connections are dynamically\n   established for the transport of diffserv
      traffic, it is very useful\n   to communicate at connection establishment time
      what forwarding\n   behavior(s) is (are) to be granted to each connection by
      the link\n   layer device so that the BAs transported experience consistent\n
      \  forwarding behavior inside the link layer cloud.  This can be\n   achieved
      by including in the connection establishment signaling\n   messages the encoding
      of the corresponding PHB, or set of PHBs, as\n   defined in this document.  Details
      on proposed usage of PHB encodings\n   by some MPLS label distribution protocols
      (RSVP and LDP) for support\n   of Diff-Serv over MPLS, can be found in [MPLS-DS].\n
      \  In another approach, the ATM Forum has a requirement to indicate\n   desired
      IP QOS treatments in ATM signaling, so that ATM switches can\n   be just as
      supportive of the desired service as are IP forwarders.\n   To do so the Forum
      is defining a new VC call setup information\n   element is which will carry
      PHB identification codes (although will\n   be generalized to do more if needed).\n"
    title: 1.1. Usage Scenarios
  title: 1. Introduction
- contents:
  - "2. Encoding\n   PHBs and sets of PHBs are encoded in an unsigned 16 bit binary
    field.\n   The 16 bit field is arranged as follows:\n   Case 1: PHBs defined by
    standards action, as per [RFC 2474].\n   The encoding for a single PHB is the
    recommended DSCP value for that\n   PHB, left-justified in the 16 bit field, with
    bits 6 through 15 set\n   to zero.  Note that the recommended DSCP value MUST
    be used, even if\n   the network in question has chosen a different mapping.\n
    \  The encoding for a set of PHBs is the numerically smallest of the set\n   of
    encodings for the various PHBs in the set, with bit 14 set to 1.\n   (Thus for
    the AF1x PHBs, the encoding is that of the AF11 PHB, with\n   bit 14 set to 1.)\n
    \        0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15\n       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n
    \      |         DSCP          | 0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   X   0 |\n       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n
    \  Case 2: PHBs not defined by standards action, i.e., experimental or\n   local
    use PHBs as allowed by [RFC 2474].  In this case an arbitrary\n   12 bit PHB identification
    code, assigned by the IANA, is placed\n   left-justified in the 16 bit field.
    \ Bit 15 is set to 1, and bit 14\n   is zero for a single PHB or 1 for a set of
    PHBs.  Bits 12 and 13 are\n   zero.\n         0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
    \  9  10  11  12  13  14  15\n       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n
    \      |                      PHB id code              | 0   0   X   1 |\n       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n
    \  Bits 12 and 13 are reserved either for expansion of the PHB\n   identification
    code, or for other use, at some point in the future.\n   In both cases, when a
    single PHBID is used to identify a set of PHBs\n   (i.e., bit 14 is set to 1),
    that set of PHBs MUST constitute a PHB\n   Scheduling Class (i.e., use of PHBs
    from the set MUST NOT cause\n   intra-microflow traffic reordering when different
    PHBs from the set\n   are applied to traffic in the same microflow).  The set
    of AF1x PHBs\n   [RFC 2597] is an example of a PHB Scheduling Class.  Sets of
    PHBs\n   that do not constitute a PHB Scheduling Class can be identified by\n
    \  using more than one PHBID.\n"

  - "3. Signalling the Class Selector Codepoints\n   [RFC 2474] defines the eight
    DS codepoint values of the form 'xxx000'\n   (where x may be '0' or '1') as the
    Class Selector Codepoints.\n   Codepoint 000000 is the recommended DSCP value
    for the Default PHB,\n   and hence the Case 1 PHBID constructed from that codepoint
    is used to\n   signal the Default PHB (see Section 2 above).\n   For convenience
    and consistent operation with networks that employ IP\n   Precedence [RFC 1812],
    the Case 1 format PHBIDs constructed from the\n   other seven Class Selector Codepoints
    may also be used to signal\n   PHBs.  In each case, the PHB signaled by such a
    PHBID is the PHB to\n   which the embedded class selector codepoint (or IP Precedence
    value\n   that corresponds to it in non-diffserv domains) is mapped in the\n   recipient's
    network.  Note that different networks will employ\n   different mappings; see
    Section 4 of [RFC 2474] for further\n   discussion.\n   Any specified use of PHBIDs
    SHOULD allow the use of the eight Case 1\n   PHBIDs constructed from the Class
    Selector Codepoints.\n"

  - "4. IANA Considerations\n   IANA is requested to create a new assignment registry
    for \"Per-Hop\n   Behavior Identification Codes\", initially allowing values in
    the\n   range 0 to 4095 decimal.\n   Assignment of values in this field require:\n
    \     -  the identity of the assignee\n      -  a brief description of the new
    PHB, with enough detail to\n         distinguish it from existing standardized
    and non-standardized\n         PHBs. In the case of a set of PHBs, this description
    should\n         cover all PHBs in the set.\n      -  a reference to a stable
    document describing the PHB in detail.\n   During the first year of existence
    of this registry, IANA is\n   requested to refer all requests to the IETF diffserv
    WG for review.\n   Subsequently, requests should be reviewed by the IETF Transport
    Area\n   Directors or by an expert that they designate.\n   If the number of assignments
    begins to approach 4096, the Transport\n   Area Directors should be alerted.\n"
  title: 4. IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   This encoding in itself raises no security issues.
    However, users of\n   this encoding should consider that modifying a PHB identification\n
    \  code may constitute theft or denial of service, so protocols using\n   this
    encoding must be adequately protected.\n   Just signalling a PHBID SHOULD NOT
    be sufficient to grant the sender\n   access to a PHB that it would otherwise
    not be able to use.  In cases\n   where this is an issue, receivers SHOULD treat
    received PHBIDs as\n   requests for service, and use local policy to determine
    whether to\n   grant or deny such requests.\n"

  - "Changes from RFC 2836\n   [RFC 2836] did not consider the Class Selector code
    points, which are\n   covered by section 3 of the present document. A clarification
    has\n   been added at the end of section 2 for the case of PHB Scheduling\n   Classes.
    \ The second paragraph of section 5 has been added.\n"
