  - "Abstract\n   The IP Version 6 addressing architecture defines an \"anycast\"
    address\n   as an IPv6 address that is assigned to one or more network interfaces\n
    \  (typically belonging to different nodes), with the property that a\n   packet
    sent to an anycast address is routed to the \"nearest\"\n   interface having that
    address, according to the routing protocols'\n   measure of distance.  This document
    defines a set of reserved anycast\n   addresses within each subnet prefix, and
    lists the initial allocation\n   of these reserved subnet anycast addresses.\n"

  - "1. Introduction\n   IP Version 6 (IPv6) defines a new type of address, known
    as an\n   \"anycast\" address, that allows a packet to be routed to one of a\n
    \  number of different nodes all responding to the same address [2, 3].\n   The
    anycast address may be assigned to one or more network interfaces\n   (typically
    on different nodes), with the network delivering each\n   packet addressed to
    this address to the \"nearest\" interface based on\n   the notion of \"distance\"
    determined by the routing protocols in use.\n   The uses of anycast addresses
    are still evolving, but such addresses\n   offer the potential for a number of
    important services [5, 6].  For\n   example, an anycast address may be used to
    allow nodes to access one\n   of a collection of servers providing a well-known
    service, without\n   manual configuration in each node of the list of servers;
    or an\n   anycast address may be used in a source route to force routing\n   through
    a specific internet service provider, without limiting\n   routing to a single
    specific router providing access to that ISP.\n   IPv6 defines a required Subnet-Router
    anycast address [3] for all\n   routers within a subnet prefix, and allows additional
    anycast\n   addresses to be taken from the unicast address space.  This document\n
    \  defines an additional set of reserved anycast addresses within each\n   subnet
    prefix, and lists the initial allocation of these reserved\n   subnet anycast
    addresses.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].\n"

  - "2. Format of Reserved Subnet Anycast Addresses\n   Within each subnet, the highest
    128 interface identifier values are\n   reserved for assignment as subnet anycast
    addresses.\n   The construction of a reserved subnet anycast address depends on
    the\n   type of IPv6 addresses used within the subnet, as indicated by the\n   format
    prefix in the addresses.  In particular, for IPv6 address\n   types required to
    have 64-bit interface identifiers in EUI-64 format,\n   the universal/local bit
    MUST be set to 0 (local) in all reserved\n   subnet anycast addresses, to indicate
    that the interface identifier\n   in the address is not globally unique.  IPv6
    addresses of this type\n   are currently specified to be those having format prefixes
    001\n   through 111, except for Multicast Addresses (1111 1111) [3].\n   Specifically,
    for IPv6 address types required to have to have 64-bit\n   interface identifiers
    in EUI-64 format, these reserved subnet anycast\n   addresses are constructed
    as follows:\n   |              64 bits            |      57 bits     |   7 bits
    \  |\n   +---------------------------------+------------------+------------+\n
    \  |           subnet prefix         | 1111110111...111 | anycast ID |\n   +---------------------------------+------------------+------------+\n
    \                                    |   interface identifier field  |\n   For
    other IPv6 address types (that is, with format prefixes other\n   than those listed
    above), the interface identifier is not in EUI-64\n   format and may be other
    than 64 bits in length; these reserved subnet\n   anycast addresses for such address
    types are constructed as follows:\n   |              n bits             |    121-n
    bits    |   7 bits   |\n   +---------------------------------+------------------+------------+\n
    \  |           subnet prefix         | 1111111...111111 | anycast ID |\n   +---------------------------------+------------------+------------+\n
    \                                    |   interface identifier field  |\n   The
    subnet prefix here consists of all fields of the IPv6 address\n   except the interface
    identifier field.  The interface identifier\n   field in these reserved subnet
    anycast addresses is formed from a\n   7-bit anycast identifier (\"anycast ID\"),
    with the remaining (highest\n   order) bits filled with all one's; however, for
    interface identifiers\n   in EUI-64 format, the universal/local bit in the interface
    identifier\n   MUST be set to 0.  The anycast identifier identifies a particular\n
    \  reserved anycast address within the subnet prefix, from the set of\n   reserved
    subnet anycast addresses.\n   The motivation for reserving the highest addresses
    from each subnet\n   rather than the lowest addresses, is to avoid conflicting
    with some\n   existing official and unofficial uses of the low-numbered addresses\n
    \  in a subnet.  For example, these low-numbered addresses are often\n   used
    for the ends of a point-to-point link, for tunnel endpoints, for\n   manually
    configured unicast addresses when a hardware token is not\n   available for the
    network interface, and even for manually configured\n   static addresses for the
    routers on a link.  Reserving only 128\n   values for anycast identifiers (rather
    than perhaps 256) means that\n   the minimum possible size of interface identifiers
    in an IPv6 address\n   is 8 bits (including room in the subnet for unicast addresses
    as well\n   as reserved subnet anycast addresses), allowing the division between\n
    \  subnet prefix and interface identifier in this case to be\n   byte-aligned.\n
    \  As with all IPv6 anycast addresses [3], these reserved subnet anycast\n   addresses
    are allocated from the IPv6 unicast address space.  All\n   reserved subnet anycast
    addresses as defined in this document are\n   reserved on all links, with all
    subnet prefixes.  They MUST NOT be\n   used for unicast addresses assigned to
    any interface.\n"

  - "4. Examples\n   To illustrate the construction of reserved subnet anycast addresses,\n
    \  this section details the construction of the reserved Mobile IPv6\n   Home-Agents
    subnet anycast address [4].  As noted in Section 3, the\n   7-bit anycast identifier
    for the Mobile IPv6 Home-Agents anycast\n   address is 126 (decimal) or 7E (hexadecimal).\n
    \  For IPv6 addresses containing a format prefix indicating that\n   interface
    identifiers are required to be 64 bits in length and are\n   required to be in
    EUI-64 format (currently format prefixes 001\n   through 111, except for 1111
    1111 [3]), the reserved Mobile IPv6\n   Home-Agents subnet anycast address consists
    of the 64-bit subnet\n   prefix followed by the 64-bit interface identifier shown
    below:\n   |0              1|1              3|3              4|4              6|\n

    types, the interface identifier may be other\n   than 64 bits in length and is
    not in EUI-64 format.  In this example,\n   assume that the length of the interface
    identifier is 64 bits, to\n   allow clear comparison with the example given above
    (although\n   interface identifiers of lengths other than 64 bits follow the same\n
    \  general construction of the interface identifier shown here).  In\n   this
    case, the reserved Mobile IPv6 Home-Agents subnet anycast\n   address consists
    of the 64-bit subnet prefix followed by the 64-bit\n   interface identifier shown
    below:\n   |0              1|1              3|3              4|4              6|\n

    poses a security\n   concern only in allowing potential attackers a well-known
    address to\n   attack.  By designating certain services to be located at specific\n
    \  reserved anycast addresses, an attacker may more profitably focus an\n   attack
    against such a specific service.  Any such attack, however, is\n   best dealt
    with in each service that uses a reserved anycast address.\n   RFC 1546, which
    originally proposed the idea of anycasting in IP,\n   also points out a number
    of security considerations with the use of\n   anycasting in general [6].\n"
