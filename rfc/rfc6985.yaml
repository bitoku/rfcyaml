  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines a method to unambiguously specify the\
    \ sequence of\n   packet sizes used in a load test.\n   Benchmarking methodologies\
    \ [RFC2544] have always relied on test\n   conditions with constant packet sizes,\
    \ with the goal of understanding\n   what network device capability has been tested.\
    \  Tests with the\n   smallest size stress the header processing capacity, and\
    \ tests with\n   the largest size stress the overall bit-processing capacity.\
    \  Tests\n   with sizes in between may determine the transition between these\
    \ two\n   capacities.\n   Streams of constant packet size differ significantly\
    \ from the\n   conditions encountered in operational deployment, so additional\
    \ tests\n   are sometimes conducted with a mixture of packet sizes.  The set of\n\
    \   sizes used is often called an Internet Mix, or \"IMIX\" [Spirent]\n   [IXIA]\
    \ [Agilent].\n   The mixture of sizes a networking device will encounter is highly\n\
    \   variable and depends on many factors.  An IMIX suited for one\n   networking\
    \ device and deployment will not be appropriate for another.\n   However, the\
    \ mix of sizes may be known, and the tester may be asked\n   to augment the fixed-size\
    \ tests.  The references above cite the\n   original studies and their methodologies.\
    \  Similar methods can be\n   used to determine new size mixes present on a link\
    \ or network.  We\n   note that the architecture for IP Flow Information Export\
    \ [RFC5470]\n   provides one method to gather packet-size information on private\n\
    \   networks.\n   To address this need and the perpetual goal of specifying repeatable\n\
    \   test conditions, this memo proposes a way to specify the exact\n   repeating\
    \ sequence of packet sizes from the usual set of fixed sizes:\n   the IMIX Genome.\
    \  Other, less exact forms of size specification are\n   also recommended for\
    \ extremely complicated or customized size mixes.\n   We apply the term \"genome\"\
    \ to infer that the entire test packet-size\n   sequence can be replicated if\
    \ this information is known -- a parallel\n   to the information needed for biological\
    \ replication.\n   This memo takes the position that it cannot be proven for all\n\
    \   circumstances that the sequence of packet sizes does not affect the\n   test\
    \ result; thus, a standardized specification of sequence is\n   valuable.\n"

- title: 3.  Scope and Goals
  contents:
  - "3.  Scope and Goals\n   This memo defines a method to unambiguously specify the\
    \ sequence of\n   packet sizes that have been used in a load test, assuming that\
    \ a\n   relevant mix of sizes is known to the tester and the length of the\n \
    \  repeating sequence is not very long (<100 packets).\n   The IMIX Genome will\
    \ allow an exact sequence of packet sizes to be\n   communicated as a single-line\
    \ name, resolving the current ambiguity\n   with results that simply refer to\
    \ \"IMIX\".  This aspect is critical\n   because no ability has been demonstrated\
    \ to extrapolate results from\n   one IMIX to another IMIX -- and certainly no\
    \ ability to extrapolate\n   results to other circumstances -- even when the mix\
    \ varies only\n   slightly from another IMIX.\n   While documentation of the exact\
    \ sequence is ideal, the memo also\n   covers the case where the sequence of sizes\
    \ is very long or may be\n   generated by a pseudorandom process.\n   It is a\
    \ colossal non-goal to standardize one or more versions of the\n   IMIX.  This\
    \ topic has been discussed on many occasions on the BMWG\n   mailing list [IMIXonList].\
    \  The goal is to enable customization with\n   minimal constraints while fostering\
    \ repeatable testing once the\n   fixed-size testing is complete.  Thus, the requirements\
    \ presented in\n   this specification, expressed in [RFC2119] terms, are intended\
    \ for\n   those performing/reporting laboratory tests to improve clarity and\n\
    \   repeatability.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Specification of the IMIX Genome\n   The IMIX Genome is specified in the\
    \ following format:\n   IMIX - 123456...x\n   where each number is replaced by\
    \ the letter corresponding to the size\n   of the packet at that position in the\
    \ sequence.  The following table\n   gives the letter encoding for the [RFC2544]\
    \ standard sizes (64, 128,\n   256, 512, 1024, 1280, and 1518 bytes) and \"jumbo\"\
    \ sizes (2112, 9000,\n   and 16000 bytes).  Note that the 4-octet Ethernet frame\
    \ check\n   sequence may fail to detect bit errors in the larger jumbo frames\n\

    \   |\n                    +--------------+--------------------+\n   For example,\
    \ a five-packet sequence with sizes 64,64,64,1280,1518\n   would be designated:\n\
    \   IMIX - aaafg\n   If z (MTU) is used, the tester MUST specify the length of\
    \ the MTU in\n   the report.\n   While this approach allows some flexibility,\
    \ there are also\n   constraints.\n   o  Packet sizes not defined by RFC 2544\
    \ would need to be approximated\n      by those available in the table.\n   o\
    \  The genome for very long sequences can become undecipherable by\n      humans.\n\
    \   Some questions testers must ask and answer when using the IMIX Genome\n  \
    \ are:\n   1.  Multiple source-destination address pairs: Is the IMIX sequence\n\
    \       applicable to each pair, across multiple pairs in sets, or across\n  \
    \     all pairs?\n   2.  Multiple tester ports: Is the IMIX sequence applicable\
    \ to each\n       port, across multiple ports in sets, or across all ports?\n\
    \   The chosen configuration would be expressed in the following general\n   form:\n\
    \   +-------------------+------------------------+---------------------+\n   |\
    \ Source Address +  | Destination Address +  | Corresponding IMIX  |\n   | Port\
    \ AND/OR Blade | Port AND/OR Blade      |                     |\n   +-------------------+------------------------+---------------------+\n\
    \   | x.x.x.x Blade2    | y.y.y.y Blade3         | IMIX - aaafg        |\n   +-------------------+------------------------+---------------------+\n\
    \   where testers can specify the IMIX used between any two entities in\n   the\
    \ test architecture (and \"Blade\" is a component in a multi-\n   component device\
    \ chassis).\n"
