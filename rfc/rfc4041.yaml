  - "Abstract\n   It has often been the case that morality has not been given proper\n\
    \   consideration in the design and specification of protocols produced\n   within\
    \ the Routing Area.  This has led to a decline in the moral\n   values within\
    \ the Internet and attempts to retrofit a suitable moral\n   code to implemented\
    \ and deployed protocols has been shown to be\n   sub-optimal.\n   This document\
    \ specifies a requirement for all new Routing Area\n   Internet-Drafts to include\
    \ a \"Morality Considerations\" section, and\n   gives guidance on what that section\
    \ should contain.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   It is well accepted by popular opinion and other reliable\
    \ metrics\n   that moral values are declining and that degeneracy is increasing.\n\
    \   Young people are particularly at risk from the rising depravity in\n   society\
    \ and much of the blame can be squarely placed at the door of\n   the Internet.\
    \  If you do not feel safe on the streets at night, what\n   do you think it is\
    \ like on the Information Superhighway?\n   When new protocols or protocol extensions\
    \ are developed within the\n   Routing Area, it is often the case that not enough\
    \ consideration is\n   given to the impact of the protocol on the moral fiber\
    \ of the\n   Internet.  The result is that moral consequences are only understood\n\
    \   once the protocols have been implemented, and sometimes not until\n   after\
    \ they have been deployed.\n   The resultant attempts to restore appropriate behavior\
    \ and purge the\n   community of improper activities are not always easy or\n\
    \   architecturally pleasant.  Further, it is possible that certain\n   protocol\
    \ designs make morality particularly hard to achieve.\n   Recognising that moral\
    \ issues are fundamental to the utility and\n   success of protocols designed\
    \ within the IETF, and that simply making\n   a wishy-washy liberal-minded statement\
    \ does not necessarily provide\n   adequate guarantees of a correct and proper\
    \ outcome for society, this\n   document defines requirements for the inclusion\
    \ of Morality\n   Considerations sections in all Internet-Drafts produced within\
    \ the\n   Routing Area.  Meeting these requirements will ensure that proper\n\
    \   consideration is given to moral issues at all stages of the protocol\n   development\
    \ process, from Requirements and Architecture, through\n   Specification and Applicability.\n\
    \   The remainder of this document describes the necessary subsections of\n  \
    \ the Morality Considerations sections, and gives guidance about what\n   information\
    \ should be contained in those subsections.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Null Morality Considerations Sections
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Null Morality Considerations Sections\n   It may be the case that the authors\
    \ of Internet-Drafts have no or few\n   morals.  This does not relieve them of\
    \ their duty to understand the\n   consequences of their actions.\n   The more\
    \ likely an author is to say that a null Morality\n   Considerations section is\
    \ acceptable, the more pressure must be\n   exerted on him by the Area and the\
    \ appropriate Working Group to\n   ensure that he gives full consideration to\
    \ his actions, and reflects\n   long and hard on the consequences of his writing\
    \ and the value of his\n   life.\n   On the other hand, some authors are well\
    \ known to have the highest\n   moral pedigree: a fact that is plainly obvious\
    \ from the company they\n   keep, the Working Groups they attend, and their eligibility\
    \ for\n   NomCom.  It is clearly unnecessary for such esteemed persons to waste\n\
    \   effort on Morality Considerations sections.  It is inconceivable that\n  \
    \ anything that they write would have anything other than a beneficial\n   effect\
    \ on the Routing Area and the Internet in general.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Mandatory Subsections
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Mandatory Subsections\n   If the Morality Considerations section is present,\
    \ it MUST contain at\n   least the following subsections.  The content of these\
    \ subsections is\n   surely self-evident to any right-thinking person.  Further\
    \ guidance\n   can be obtained from your moral guardian, your household gods,\
    \ or\n   from any member of the IMM (Internet Moral Majority).\n   -  Likelihood\
    \ of misuse by depraved or sick individuals.  This\n      subsection must fully\
    \ address the possibility that the proposed\n      protocols or protocol extensions\
    \ might be used for the\n      distribution of blue, smutty, or plain disgusting\
    \ images.\n   -  Likelihood of misuse by misguided individuals.  There is an\n\
    \      obvious need to protect minors and people with misguided thought\n    \
    \  processes from utilising the protocols or protocol extensions for\n      purposes\
    \ that would inevitably do them harm.\n   -  Likelihood of misuse by large, multi-national\
    \ corporations.  Such\n      a thought is, of course, unthinkable.\n   -  Availability\
    \ of oversight facilities.  There are those who would\n      corrupt our morals\
    \ motivated as they are by a hatred of the\n      freedom of Internet access with\
    \ which we are graced.  We place a\n      significant burden of responsibility\
    \ on those who guard our\n      community from these evil-doers and it is only\
    \ fitting that we\n      give them as much support as is possible.  Therefore,\
    \ all\n      encryption and obfuscation techniques MUST be excluded -\n      individuals\
    \ who have nothing to hide need to fear the oversight of\n      those whose morals\
    \ are beyond doubt.\n   -  Inter-SDO impact.  We must allow for other moral frameworks\
    \ and\n      fully respect other people's right to subscribe to other belief\n\
    \      systems.  Such people are, however, wrong and doomed to spend\n      eternity\
    \ in a dark corner with only dial-up access.  So it has\n      been written.\n\
    \   -  Care and concern for avian carriers.  A duck may be somebody's\n      mother.\n\
    \   Even if one or more of these subsections are considered irrelevant,\n   they\
    \ MUST all still be present, and MUST contain a full rebuttal of\n   this deviant\
    \ thought.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Provision of Services
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Provision of Services\n   We must do our utmost to ensure that services\

    \ Quality of\n   Service (QoS) and meeting the needs of the consumer of the service.\n\

- title: 3.2.  Political Correctness (PC)
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Political Correctness (PC)\n   Political correctness has gone too far.\
    \  This problem can be traced\n   way back to the 1970s when the desktop PC was\
    \ invented.  It is\n   necessary for Internet-Drafts to observe a form of political\n\
    \   correctness, but note that you do not always have to mean what you\n   say.\n"
- title: 3.2.1.  Differentiated Services
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Differentiated Services\n   Segregation of packets on the grounds of\
    \ color is now banned and\n   Internet-Drafts must not make use of this technique.\n\
    \   If you follow all of the recommendations in this document, you will\n   find\
    \ that \"packets of color\" (as we must now refer to them) tend to\n   avoid your\
    \ points of presence, and you will no longer be troubled by\n   them.\n"

- title: 3.3.  Protection or Abstinence
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Protection or Abstinence\n   Much has been made recently of the need to\
    \ provide protection within\n   the Internet.  It is the role of the IMM to determine\
    \ when protection\n   is required, and the role of the IESG bulldogs to ensure\
    \ that we are\n   all protected.\n   However, protection is only one way to prevent\
    \ unplanned outages and,\n   as we all know, the ready availability of protection\
    \ schemes such as\n   1:1 (one-on-one) or 1:n (orgy-mode) have lead to a belief\
    \ that it is\n   acceptable to switch (or swing) at will.  It should be noted\
    \ that\n   protection can fail, and under no circumstances should extra traffic\n\
    \   be countenanced.\n   In reality, the only safe way to avoid passing data to\
    \ your friends\n   is to agree to pledge to have no control plane before marriage.\

- title: 3.4.  Promiscuity
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Promiscuity\n   Various disgusting protocols indulge in promiscuity.  This\
    \ appears to\n   happen most often when an operator is unwilling to select a single\n\
    \   partner and wants to play the field.\n   Promiscuous modes of operation are\
