  - "1.  Introduction\n   The design of Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) is generally\n
    \  focused on saving energy, which is often a very constrained resource.\n   Other
    constraints, such as memory capacity and duty cycle\n   restrictions on LLN devices,
    usually derive from that primary\n   concern.  Energy is often available only
    from primary batteries that\n   are expected to last for years or is scavenged
    from the environment\n   in very limited amounts.  Any protocol that is intended
    for use in\n   LLNs must be designed with a primary focus on saving energy, which
    is\n   a strict requirement.\n   Controlling the amount of data transmission is
    one possible means of\n   saving energy.  In a number of LLN standards, the frame
    size is\n   limited to much smaller values than the IPv6 maximum transmission\n
    \  unit (MTU) of 1280 bytes.  In particular, an LLN that relies on the\n   classical
    Physical Layer (PHY) of IEEE 802.15.4 [IEEE.802.15.4] is\n   limited to 127 bytes
    per frame.  The need to compress IPv6 packets\n   over IEEE 802.15.4 led to the
    6LoWPAN Header Compression (6LoWPAN-HC)\n   [RFC6282] work.\n   As more and more
    protocols need to be compressed, the encoding\n   capabilities of the original
    dispatch defined in the 6LowPAN\n   adaptation-layer framework ([RFC4944] and
    [RFC6282]) becomes\n   saturated.  This specification introduces a new context
    switch\n   mechanism for 6LoWPAN compression, expressed in terms of Pages and\n
    \  signaled by a new Paging Dispatch mechanism.\n"

    in\n   [RFC2119].\n   The terminology used in this document is consistent with
    and\n   incorporates that described in \"Terms Used in Routing for Low-Power\n
    \  and Lossy Networks\" [RFC7102] and \"Terminology for Constrained-Node\n   Networks\"
    [RFC7228].\n"

  - "3.  Updating RFC 4944\n   This document adapts 6LoWPAN while maintaining backward
    compatibility\n   with IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4 [RFC4944] by introducing the concept
    of\n   a \"parsing context\" in the 6LoWPAN parser, a context being identified\n
    \  by a Page Number.  This specification defines 16 Pages.\n   Pages are delimited
    in a 6LoWPAN packet by a Paging Dispatch value\n   that indicates the next current
    Page.  The Page Number is encoded in\n   a Paging Dispatch with the Value Bit
    Pattern of 11 11xxxx, where xxxx\n   is the Page Number, 0 to 15, as described
    in Figure 1:\n                            0\n                            0 1 2
    3 4 5 6 7\n                           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n                           |1|1|1|1|Page
    Nb|\n                           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n            Figure 1: Paging
    Dispatch with Page Number Encoding\n   Values of the Dispatch byte defined in
    [RFC4944] are considered as\n   belonging to the Page 0 parsing context, which
    is the default and\n   does not need to be signaled explicitly at the beginning
    of a 6LoWPAN\n   packet.  This ensures backward compatibility with existing\n
    \  implementations of 6LoWPAN.\n   The Dispatch bits defined in [RFC4944] are
    used in Page 0 and are\n   free to be reused in Pages 1 to 15.  In Section 4,
    this specification\n   allocates some values in Page 1 and leaves the rest open
    for future\n   allocations.\n   Values made available by this specification in
    Pages 1 to 14 are to\n   be assigned for new protocols whereas Page 15 is reserved
    for\n   Experimental Use [RFC5226].\n   Note: This specification does not use
    the Escape Dispatch, which\n   extends Page 0 to more values, but rather allocates
    another Dispatch\n   Bit Pattern (11 11xxxx) for a new Paging Dispatch that is
    present in\n   all Pages, including Page 0 and Pages defined in future\n   specifications,
    to indicate the next parsing context represented by\n   its Page Number.  The
    rationale for avoiding that approach is that\n   there can be multiple occurrences
    of a new header indexed by this\n   specification in a single frame and the overhead
    on an octet each\n   time for the Escape Dispatch would be prohibitive.\n   A
    Page (say Page N) is said to be active once the Page N Paging\n   Dispatch is
    parsed, and it remains active until another Paging\n   Dispatch is parsed.\n"

  - "4.  Page 1 Paging Dispatch\n   This specification defines some special properties
    for Page 1,\n   detailed below:\n      The Dispatch bits defined for LOWPAN_IPHC
    by the \"Compression\n      Format for IPv6 Datagrams over IEEE 802.15.4-Based
    Networks\"\n      [RFC6282] are defined with the same values in Page 1, so there
    is\n      no need to switch context from Page 1 to Page 0 to decode a packet\n
    \     that is encoded per [RFC6282].\n      Mesh Headers represent Layer 2 information
    and are processed\n      before any Layer 3 information that is encoded in Page
    1.  If a\n      6LoWPAN packet requires a Mesh Header, the Mesh Header MUST always\n
    \     be placed in the packet before the first Page 1 Paging Dispatch,\n      if
    any.\n      For the same reason, Fragment Headers as defined in [RFC4944] MUST\n
    \     always be placed in the packet before the first Page 1 Paging\n      Dispatch,
    if any.\n      The NALP Dispatch Bit Pattern as defined in [RFC4944] is only\n
    \     defined for the first octet in the packet.  Switching back to Page\n      0
    for NALP inside a 6LoWPAN packet does not make sense.\n      As a result, there
    is no need to restore the Page 0 parsing\n      context after a context was switched
    to Page 1, so the value for\n      the Page 0 Paging Dispatch of 11 110000 may
    not actually occur in\n      those packets that adhere to 6LoWPAN specifications
    available at\n      the time of writing this specification.\n"
