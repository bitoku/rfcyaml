- title: 1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of\
    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\
    \ please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are\
    \ accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information\
    \ Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network\
    \ Management Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms\
    \ defined in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies\
    \ a MIB\n   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n\
    \   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"
- title: 2.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "2.  Introduction\n   A Multimedia Terminal Adapter (MTA) is used to deliver broadband\n\
    \   Internet, data, and/or voice access jointly with telephony service to\n  \
    \ a subscriber's or customer's premises using a cable network\n   infrastructure.\
    \  An MTA is normally installed at the subscriber's or\n   customer's premises\
    \ and is coupled to a multiple system operator\n   (MSO) using a hybrid fiber\
    \ coax (HFC) access network.\n   An MTA is provisioned by the MSO for broadband\
    \ Internet, data, and/or\n   voice service.  For more information on MTA provisioning,\
    \ refer to\n   [PKT-SP-PROV] and [RFC4682].  MTA devices include one or more\n\
    \   endpoints (e.g., telephone ports), which receive call signaling\n   information\
    \ to establish ring cadence, and codecs, which provide\n   telephony service.\n\
    \   For more information on call signaling refer to, [PKT-SP-MGCP] and\n   [RFC3435].\n\
    \   For more information on codecs, refer to [PKT-SP-CODEC].\n   Given the complexity\
    \ of such systems, it is important that a suitable\n   event management mechanism\
    \ be defined to allow for effective\n   management.  This MIB module provides\
    \ objects suitable for generation\n   and management of events on the MTA.\n"

    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [RFC2119].\n   The terms \"MIB module\" and \"information module\" are\
    \ used\n   interchangeably in this memo.  As used here, both terms refer to any\n\
    \   of the three types of information modules defined in Section 3 of RFC\n  \
    \ 2578 [RFC2578].  Some of the terms used in this memo are defined\n   below.\

- title: 4.  Overview
  contents:
  - "4.  Overview\n   PacketCable, European Telecommunications Standards Institute\
    \ (ETSI),\n   and International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication\n  \
    \ Standardization Sector (ITU-T) IPCablecom-compliant Multimedia\n   Terminal\
    \ Adaptors (MTAs) are required to generate management events\n   upon the occurrence\
    \ of certain operational conditions (for instance,\n   \"AC power failure, MTA\
    \ operational on battery power\").  The complete\n   set of conditions and the\
    \ corresponding management events to be\n   generated are specified in [PKT-SP-MEM1.5]\
    \ (PacketCable),\n   [ETSITS101909-22] (ETSI), and [ITU-T-J176] (ITU-T).  In addition,\
    \ the\n   MTA manufacturer is allowed to specify vendor-specific management\n\
    \   events.  For example, vendor XYZ can specify \"Memory read error,\n   terminating\
    \ process, code: XYZ123\".\n   When management events are generated, they can\
    \ either be stored in a\n   local log on the MTA or transmitted using two possible\
    \ mechanisms:\n   SNMP or syslog.  This choice between storing and transmitting\
    \ is\n   required to be configurable and manageable by the management station\n\
    \   for each management event (default values can be provided when the\n   events\
    \ are defined).  This document proposes a MIB that can provide\n   for configuration\
    \ and management of such management events.  A means\n   to log the events is\
    \ provided within the specified MIB module.  For\n   syslog as a transport, the\
    \ necessary information (format, transport,\n   etc.) is also specified.  For\
    \ SNMP as a transport, the MIB objects\n   specified in the SNMP-TARGET-MIB and\
    \ SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB as\n   utilized, is specified in [RFC3413].\n   Further,\
    \ each management event can be uniquely identified using the\n   'Organization\
    \ ID' and 'Event ID'.  The 'Organization ID' is the\n   private enterprise number\
    \ of the organization specifying the event\n   (e.g., 4491 for CableLabs) and\
    \ a unique identifier that identifies\n   the event.  The 'Event ID' is an identifier\
    \ that uniquely identifies\n   the event within the 'Organization ID' space. \
    \ This document does not\n   specify any management events.  It only provides\
    \ a mechanism to\n   manage the storage and transmission of events.\n   The EVENT\
    \ MIB module specified in this document is intended to update\n   the EVENT MIB\
    \ modules from which it is partly derived:\n   - the PacketCable 1.5 Management\
    \ Event MIB Specification\n     [PKT-SP-EVEMIB1.5] and\n   - the ITU-T IPCablecom\
    \ management event mechanism MIB requirements\n     [ITU-T-J176].\n   Several\
    \ normative and informative references are used to help define\n   Management\
    \ Event MIB objects.  As a convention, wherever the\n   requirements are equivalent\
    \ at the time of the writing, the\n   PacketCable reference is used.  However,\
    \ MTA implementations MUST\n   refer to the corresponding specifications to ensure\
    \ compliance.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Structure of the MIB
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Structure of the MIB\n   The Management Event MIB module is identified\
    \ by pktcIetfEventMib and\n   is structured into the following sub-trees:\n  \
    \ - pktcEventControl specifies the management information pertinent to\n     control\
    \ of the device's event generation capabilities.\n   - pktcEventThrottle specifies\
    \ the management information pertinent to\n     throttling the transmission of\
    \ management events using syslog or\n     SNMP.\n   - pktcEventStatus specifies\
    \ the management information for the device\n     to report status information\
    \ related to the generated events.\n   - pktcEvents specifies the management information\
    \ for the device to\n     list all the events it is capable of generating.\n \
    \  - pktcEventLog specifies the management information for the device to\n   \
    \  store the generated events.\n   - pktcEventNotifications specifies the management\
    \ information that\n     defines the SNMP trap and inform messages.\n"
- title: 4.2.  pktcEventControl
  contents:
  - "4.2.  pktcEventControl\n   The group of objects in this sub-tree provide for\
    \ three important\n   controls: ability to reset the event logs and event descriptions,\n\
    \   syslog configuration, and event classes.\n   Some highlights are as follows:\n\
    \   pktcEventReset - this MIB object allows a management station to reset\n  \
    \ the event logs, the event descriptions, or both.\n   pktcEventSyslog - this\
    \ group of MIB objects allows the management\n   station to provide information\
    \ for transmission of events to a syslog\n   server, such as message formats and\
    \ transport protocols.\n   pktcEventClassTable - this MIB table allows for MTAs\
    \ to classify the\n   management events into different categories, termed 'event\
    \ classes'.\n   It then allows for common operations to be affected across all\
    \ the\n   events pertaining to a specific event class.\n"
- title: 4.3.  pktcEventThrottle
  contents:
  - "4.3.  pktcEventThrottle\n   As indicated earlier, the generated events can be\
    \ stored locally or\n   transmitted using SNMP, syslog, or both.  However, the\
    \ management\n   stations receiving such events may wish to control the rate of\n\
    \   transmission of such events.  This event-throttling behavior is\n   provided\
    \ by the MIB objects in this sub-tree.\n   Some highlights are as follows:\n \
    \  pktcEventThrottleAdminStatus - this MIB object allows for\n   transmissions\
    \ to be unconstrained, maintained below threshold,\n   stopped at the threshold,\
    \ or inhibited.\n   pktcEventThrottleThreshold - this MIB object specifies the\
    \ throttle,\n   i.e., the number of events over an interval that is considered\
    \ to be\n   the threshold.\n   pktcEventThrottleInterval - this MIB object specifies\
    \ the interval\n   over which the threshold is calculated.\n"
- title: 4.4.  pktcEventStatus
  contents:
  - "4.4.  pktcEventStatus\n   This sub-tree is designed to provide status information\
    \ related to\n   event transmissions.  It currently contains one MIB object,\n\
    \   pktcEventTransmissionStatus, that allows a client to report the\n   status\
    \ of event transmissions.\n"
- title: 4.5.  pktcEvent
  contents:
  - "4.5.  pktcEvent\n   This sub-tree is designed to provide a list of all the events\
    \ that\n   can be generated by an MTA and its associated descriptions.  The MIB\n\
    \   objects are grouped under the MIB table pktcEventTable.\n"
- title: 4.6.  pktcEventLog
  contents:
  - "4.6.  pktcEventLog\n   This sub-tree is designed to allow the MTA to store all\
    \ the events\n   that are generated during its operation.  The events are stored\
    \ with\n   information such as the time of the event, its description and\n  \
    \ related characteristics like severity levels.\n"
- title: 4.7.  pktcEventNotifications
  contents:
  - "4.7.  pktcEventNotifications\n   This sub-tree specifies the notification information,\
    \ i.e., when MTAs\n   transmit messages using SNMP traps and informs.  SNMP traps\
    \ refer to\n   the SNMPv2-Trap-PDU.  SNMPv1 traps are disallowed.\n"
- title: 5.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules
  contents:
  - "5.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules\n   Some management objects defined in\
    \ other MIB modules are applicable\n   to an entity implementing this MIB.  In\
    \ particular, it is assumed\n   that an entity implementing the PKTC-IETF-EVENT-MIB\
    \ module will also\n   implement the 'interfaces' group of the IF-MIB [RFC2863].\n"

    \     DESCRIPTION\n               \"This MIB object allows a management station\
    \ to\n               clear the local log of generated events, reset the\n    \
    \           management event descriptions, or both.\n               MTAs generate\
    \ management events.  These events are stored\n               in the MIB table\
    \ pktcEventLogTable.  If a management\n               station needs to clear all\
    \ the current entries (e.g.,\n               after a troubleshooting operation\
    \ is complete), it can\n               do so by setting the resetEventLogTable(0)\
    \ bit to a\n               value of '1'.\n               The MTA is pre-configured\
    \ with the events that it can\n               generate.  This is stored in the\
    \ MIB table\n               pktcEventTable.  This table also contains the\n  \
    \             descriptions associated with these events.  These\n            \
    \   descriptions can be modified by a management station.\n               However,\
    \ if the management station wishes to reset the\n               descriptions to\
    \ factory defaults, it can do so by\n               setting the resetEventTable(1)\
    \ bit to a value of '1'.\n               The MTA actions are summarized below:\n\
    \                 Bit resetEventLogTable(0) set to a value of '1'\n          \
    \        - delete all entries in pktcEventLogTable;\n                  - reset\
    \ the value of pktcEventLogIndex to '0'.\n                 Bit resetEventTable(1)\
    \ set to a value of '1'\n                  - reset the pktcEventTable to the\n\
    \                    factory default values.\n                 Bits resetEventLogTable(0)\
    \ and resetEventTable(1)\n                 set to a value of '1'\n           \
    \       - perform the above actions as though they were\n                    performed\
    \ individually (in any order).\n                 Setting a reset bit to a value\
    \ of '0' MUST NOT\n                 result in any action.\n               The\
    \ MTA MUST perform the above actions regardless of\n               persistence\
    \ (i.e., storage in non-volatile memory).\n               The MTA MUST always\
    \ return a value of '00' when\n               this MIB object is read.\n     \
    \          A management station that resets tables using this MIB\n          \
    \     object needs to be careful about the impact to other\n               management\
    \ stations that may be reliant on the\n               information contained in\
    \ the table(s) being reset.  For\n               example, say management station\
    \ A creates a specific set\n               of event descriptions in the event\
    \ table\n               (pktcEventTable) for debugging purposes and expects any\n\
    \               generated events to report the modified descriptions.  In\n  \
    \             such a case, if another management station resets the\n        \
    \       event table to factory defaults, any subsequent events\n             \
    \  will not contain the modified descriptions expected by\n               management\
    \ station A.  Such multi-manager contentions are\n               not addressed\
    \ within this MIB module.  Thus, management\n               stations are RECOMMENDED\
    \ to use this MIB object with\n               care and caution, and only when\
    \ absolutely required.\"\n       ::= { pktcEventControl 1 }\n   ---\n   -- syslog-specific\

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects\
    \ may be\n   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.\
    \  The\n   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper\n\
    \   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.\n   Security\
    \ threats include events unreported on errors, redirection of\n   events (deliberately\
    \ or otherwise) or minimized reporting of errors.\n   Such threats can mask certain\
    \ misconfiguration attempts and denial of\n   service attacks that can be recognized\
    \ and thwarted via event\n   reporting.\n   MIB objects of significance include:\n\
    \   - those that control the event generation, the target syslog address\n   \
    \  for events and the reporting status, i.e.:\n       pktcEventReset\n       pktcEventSyslogAddressType\n\
    \       pktcEventSyslogAddress\n       pktcEventSyslogPort\n       pktcEventSyslogMessageFormat\n\
    \       pktcEventSyslogTransport\n       pktcEventClassStatus\n   - those related\
    \ to event classes, i.e.: pktcEventClassSeverity\n   - those related to throttling,\
    \ i.e.: pktcEventThrottleAdminStatus\n     pktcEventThrottleThreshold pktcEventThrottleInterval\n\
    \   - those related to the event reporting capabilities of an MTA, i.e:\n    \
    \ pktcEventSeverityLevel pktcEventReporting pktcEventText\n   The MIB object pktcEventReset\
    \ deserves special mention since access\n   to this MIB object can be used to\
    \ disrupt event collection by\n   management stations.  For example, consider\
    \ a management station that\n   modifies the descriptions in the event table pktcEventTable.\
    \  It\n   would then expect management events generated by the MTA to reflect\n\
    \   the modified values.  A rogue management station that has access to\n   the\
    \ pktcEventReset can reset the event table, resulting in the\n   management station\
    \ not receiving events with the expected\n   descriptions.  Further, a rogue management\
    \ station with access to\n   pktcEventReset can also clear local logs, eliminating\
    \ local logs of\n   generated events for management stations that are not configured\
    \ to\n   receive syslog or SNMP messages.  The same concerns apply when\n   allowed\
    \ management stations performing such operations are unaware of\n   other management\
    \ stations that may be reliant on the event table or\n   the event log table for\
    \ management or monitoring.  This MIB module\n   does not address such multi-manager\
    \ contentions, and recommends that\n   the MIB object pktcEventReset be used with\
    \ caution.\n   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects\
    \ with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive\
    \ or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to\n \
    \  control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly\n   to\
    \ even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over\n   the network\
    \ via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n\
    \   pktcEventLogTable: This table contains the log of generated event\n   messages.\
    \  Read access to this table might reveal some specific\n   information that should\
    \ be kept confidential.\n   pktcEventTransmissionStatus: This MIB object reveals\
    \ the status of\n   event transmission and MAY be sensitive in some environments.\n\
    \   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even\
    \ if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n   even then,\
    \ there is no control as to who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access\
    \ and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n\
    \   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as\n  \
    \ provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full\
    \ support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication and\
    \ privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n\
    \   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable\
    \ cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to\
    \ ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module,\
    \ is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals\
    \ (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to perform GET or SET (change/create/delete)\
    \ operations.\n"
