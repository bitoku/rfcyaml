  - "1.  Introduction\n   This specification defines \"full mode\" carriage of facsimile
    data\n   over the Internet, building upon previous work in A Simple Mode of\n
    \  Facsimile Using Internet Mail [RFC3965] and Extended Facsimile Using\n   Internet
    Mail [RFC2532].  This specification also adds the remaining\n   functionality
    necessary to achieve reliable and capable negotiation\n   for Internet mail, on
    par with classic [T30] facsimile.  These\n   additional features are designed
    to provide the highest level of\n   interoperability with the standards-compliant
    email infrastructure\n   and mail user agents, while providing a level of service
    that closely\n   approximates the level of service currently enjoyed by fax users.\n
    \  Basic terminology is discussed in [RFC2542].  Implementations that\n   conform
    to this specification MUST also conform to [RFC3965] and\n   [RFC2532].\n   The
    new features are designed to be interoperable with the existing\n   base of mail
    transfer agents (MTAs) and mail user agents (MUAs), and\n   to take advantage
    of existing standards for optional functionality\n   (e.g., positive delivery
    confirmation and disposition notification).\n   Enhancements described in this
    document utilize the existing Internet\n   email messaging infrastructure, where
    possible, instead of creating\n   fax-specific features that are unlikely to be
    implemented in non-fax\n   messaging software.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST
    NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described
    in [RFC2119].\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Content Negotiation\n   Classic facsimile service is interactive, such that
    a sending station\n   can discover the capabilities of the receiving station,
    prior to\n   sending a facsimile of a document.  This permits the sender to\n
    \  transmit the best quality of facsimile supported by both the sending\n   station
    and the receiving station.  Internet mail is\n   store-and-forward, with potentially
    long latency, such that\n   before-the-fact negotiation is problematic.\n   Use
    of a negotiation mechanism permits senders to transfer a richer\n   document form
    than is permitted when using the safer-but-universal\n   default form.  Without
    this mechanism, the sender of a document\n   cannot be certain that the receiving
    station will be able to support\n   the form.\n   The capabilities that can be
    negotiated by an FFPIM participant are\n   specified in [RFC2534] and [RFC2879].
    \ Implementations that are\n   conformant to FFPIM MUST support content negotiation
    as described\n   there.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  UA-based Content Negotiation\n   One method for exchanging the capabilities
      information uses a\n   post-hoc technique, which permits an originator to send
      the best\n   version known to be supported by the recipient, and to also send
      a\n   better suited version if the recipient requests it.  This mechanism\n
      \  is specified in [RFC3297].  FFPIM implementations MUST support this\n   mechanism.\n"
    title: 2.1.  UA-based Content Negotiation
  - contents:
    - "2.2.  ESMTP-based Content Negotiation\n   Another method uses an ESMTP option
      specified in [RFC4141].  It\n   requires support for content negotiation along
      the entire path the\n   email travels.  Using this mechanism, receiving ESMTP
      servers are\n   able to report capabilities of the addresses (mailboxes) they\n
      \  support, and sending email clients are able to signal both permission\n   and
      constraints on conversions.\n   FFPIM participants MAY support this mechanism.\n
      \  NOTE: This specification provides for content conversion by\n      unspecified
      intermediaries.  Use of this mechanism carries\n      significant risk.  Although
      intermediaries always have the ability\n      to perform damaging transformations,
      use of this specification\n      could result in more exploitation of that potential
      and,\n      therefore, more misbehavior.  Use of intermediaries is discussed\n
      \     in [RFC3238].\n"
    title: 2.2.  ESMTP-based Content Negotiation
  - contents:
    - "2.3.  Interactions between UA and ESMTP Negotiation Mechanisms\n   FFPIM participants
      must ensure that their use of the UA and ESMTP\n   methods for content negotiation
      is compatible.  For example, two\n   mechanisms might consult two different
      repositories of capabilities\n   information, and those repositories might contain
      different\n   information.  Presumably, this means that at least one of these\n
      \  repositories is inaccurate.  Therefore, the larger problem is one of\n   correctness,
      rather than synchronization.\n   This specification does not require a particular
      method of using the\n   mechanisms together.\n"

  - "3.  Content Format\n   FFPIM allows the transfer of enhanced TIFF data relative
    to [RFC3965]\n   and [RFC2532].  The details for these enhancements are contained
    in\n   [RFC3949].  Implementations that are conformant to FFPIM SHOULD\n   support
    TIFF enhancements.\n   It should also be noted that the content negotiation mechanism\n
    \  permits a sender to know the full range of content types that are\n   supported
    by the recipient.  Therefore, requirements for support of\n   TIFF represent a
    functional minimum for FFPIM.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   As this document is an extension of [RFC3965]
    and [RFC2532], the\n   Security Considerations sections of [RFC3965] and [RFC2532]
    apply to\n   this document, including discussion of PGP and S/MIME use for\n   authentication
    and privacy.\n   It appears that the mechanisms added by this specification do
    not\n   introduce new security considerations.  However, the concerns raised\n
    \  in [RFC2532] are particularly salient for these new mechanisms.\n   Use of
    this specification should occur with particular attention to\n   the following
    security concerns:\n   * Negotiation can be used as a denial of service attack.\n
    \  * Negotiation may lead to the use of an unsafe data format.\n   * Negotiation
    discloses information and therefore raises privacy\n     concerns.\n   Use of
    the ESMTP CONNEG option permits content transformation by an\n   intermediary,
    along the mail transfer path.  When the contents are\n   encrypted, the intermediary
    cannot perform the conversion, because it\n   is not expected to have access to
    the relevant secret keying\n   material.  When the contents are signed, but not
    encrypted,\n   conversion will invalidate the signature.  Therefore, permission
    to\n   convert SHOULD NOT normally be used with signed or sealed messages.\n"

  - "Appendix A.  Direct Mode\n   Email is a store-and-forward service, typically
    with highly variable\n   delay between the time a message leaves the sender's
    realm and the\n   time it arrives in the receiver's realm.  The number of relays\n
    \  between sender and receiver is also unknown and variable.  By\n   contrast,
    facsimile is generally considered to be direct and\n   immediate.\n   An email
    profile that fully emulates facsimile must solve several\n   different problems.
    \ One is to ensure that the document\n   representation semantics are faithful.
    \ Another is that the\n   interaction between sender and receiver is similar to
    that of\n   telephony-based facsimile.  In particular, it must ensure the\n   timeliness
    of the interaction.  The specifications for FFPIM and its\n   predecessors enable
    email to emulate the former, the information\n   (semantics) activities of facsimile.\n
    \  The ESMTP CONNEG option sets the stage for achieving the latter, with\n   email-based
    facsimile transfer that has interactive negotiations, on\n   a par with telephony-based
    facsimile.  The key, additional\n   requirement is to achieve timeliness.  Ultimately,
    timeliness\n   requires configuring sender and receiver email servers to interact\n
    \  directly.  The sender's MTA must directly contact the receiver's MTA.\n   With
    typical email service configurations, the content and\n   interaction semantics
    of facsimile can be emulated quite well, but\n   timeliness cannot be assured.\n
    \  To achieve direct sending, the originating MTA must not use\n   sending-side
    intermediaries such as outbound enterprise MTAs.\n   Instead, it must be configured
    to do transmissions directly to hosts\n   specified in email addresses, based
    on queries to the public DNS.  To\n   achieve direct receiving, the target MTAs
    must have DNS A records,\n   without MX records.  That is, they also must be configured
    not to use\n   intermediaries.\n   The sender may then use ESMTP Conneg to determine
    the capabilities of\n   the receiver.  Afterwards the sender will use the capabilities\n
    \  information to tailor the TIFF message content it sends.\n"
