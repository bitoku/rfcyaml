  - "2.1 Overview\n   MAPOS/PPP tunneling mode is based on header rewriting.  Figure\
    \ 2.\n   shows an example of MAPOS/PPP tunneling mode.  The MAPOS network uses\n\
    \   MAPOS 16 [2] in this example.  Consider a tunneling path between\n   customer\
    \ premise equipment (CPE) A and CPE B which are industry\n   standard POS equipment.\
    \  The ingress/egress MAPOS switches A/B\n   assigns unique MAPOS addresses (0x0203\
    \ and 0x0403) to the CPEs.\n   These MAPOS addresses are used in the MAPOS network,\
    \ for frame\n   forwarding between CPE A and CPE B.  NSP [5] will not be running\n\
    \   between the CPEs and the switches in this case.\n   MAPOS switch A rewrites\
    \ the first 2 octets of every frame from CPE A,\n   which are fixed as 0xFF and\
    \ 0x03, to the MAPOS address of its peer,\n   which is 0x0403.  Frames are forwarded\
    \ by the MAPOS network and\n   arrives at the egress MAPOS switch B which rewrites\
    \ the first 2\n   octets to their original values.  If MAPOS v1 [1] is used in\
    \ the\n   MAPOS network, only the first octet is rewritten.\n    +-----+ POS/0x0203\

  - "2.2.1 Physical Layer\n   For transport media between border MAPOS switch and\

    \ power\n   budget and all physical requirements are the same as those of PPP\n\
    \   over SONET/SDH [3].\n   SONET/SDH overheads are terminated at the ingress/egress\

  - "2.2.2 Link layer\n   Link layer framing between CPE and MAPOS switch also follows\
    \ the\n   specification of PPP over SONET/SDH [3].\n   HDLC operation including\
    \ byte stuffing, scrambling, FCS generation is\n   terminated at the ingress/egress\
    \ switch.  In a MAPOS switch, HDLC\n   frame [4] is picked up from a SONET/SDH\
    \ payload and the first octet\n   (HDLC address) for MAPOS v1 [1], or the first\
    \ two octets (HDLC\n   address and control field) for MAPOS 16 [2] are rewritten.\
    \  The\n   operation inside the border switch is as follows:\n    From CPE (Ingress\
    \ Switch receiving):\n      SONET/SDH framing\n         -> X^43+1 De-scrambling\
    \ -> HDLC Byte de-stuffing\n         -> HDLC FCS detection (if error, silently\

    \         -> HDLC Byte stuffing -> X^43+1 Scrambling -> SONET/SDH framing\n  \
    \ For STS-3c-SPE/VC-4, non-scrambled frame can be used for\n   compatibility with\
    \ RFC 1619.  However, the use of 32bit-CRC and\n   X^43+1 scrambling is recommended\
    \ in RFC2615 [3] and for MAPOS\n   networks.\n   Maximum transmission unit (MTU)\
    \ of the link must not be negotiated\n   larger than MAPOS-MTU which is 65280\
    \ octets.\n   Figure 3 shows a CPE-side L2 frame and the converted frame in the\n\

- title: 2.3.2 Path Establishment
  contents:
  - "2.3.2 Path Establishment\n   A MAPOS/PPP tunneling path is established by following\
    \ steps.\n      a) Choose MAPOS address pair on both ingress/egress switches and\n\
    \         configure their ports to PPP tunneling mode (see 2.3.1).\n      b) When\
    \ the routes for both directions become stable, the\n         tunneling path is\
    \ established.  The link between the CPEs may\n         be set up at that moment;\
    \ PPP LCP controls are transparently\n         exchanged by the CPEs.\n   To add\
    \ a new path, operators should pick unused MAPOS address-pair.\n   They may be\
    \ determined simply by choosing switches and ports for each\n   CPE, because there\
    \ is one-to-one correspondence between MAPOS\n   addresses and switch ports.\n\
    \   Then, those ports should be configured to MAPOS/PPP tunneling mode on\n  \
    \ both of the switches.  Frame reachability is provided by SSP [6] in\n   the\
    \ MAPOS network.  When the frame forwarding for each direction are\n   stable,\
    \ the path is established and frame forwarding is started.\n   Until then, the\
    \ link between border switches and CPE should be down.\n   A MAPOS/PPP tunneling\
    \ path should be managed by the pair of MAPOS\n   addresses.  It should be carefully\
    \ handled to avoid misconfiguration\n   such as path duplication.  For convenient\
    \ management, path database\n   can be used to keep information about pairs of\
    \ MAPOS addresses.  Note\n   that the path database is not used for frame forwarding.\
    \  It is for\n   OAM&P use only.\n"
- title: 2.3.3 Failure detection and indication
  contents:
  - "2.3.3 Failure detection and indication\n   When any link or node failure is detected,\
    \ it should be indicated to\n   each peer of the path.  This is done by PPP [7]\
    \ keep-alive (LCP Echo\n   request/reply) for end-to-end detection.\n   Consideration\
    \ is required to handle SONET/SDH alarms.  When a link\n   between CPE and the\
    \ MAPOS switch fails, it is detected by both the\n   MAPOS switch and the CPE\
    \ seeing SONET/SDH alarms.  However, far-side\n   link remains up and no SONET/SDH\
    \ error is found;  SONET/SDH alarms\n   are not transferred to the far end because\
    \ each optical path is\n   terminated in MAPOS network.  In this case, the far\
    \ end will see\n   'link up, line protocol down' status due to keep-alive expiration.\n\
    \   For example, Figure 5 shows a tunneling path.  When link 1 goes down,\n  \
    \ MAPOS sw A and CPE A detects SONET/SDH alarms but MAPOS sw B and CPE\n   A'\
    \ do not see this failure.  When PPP keep-alive expires, CPE A'\n   detects the\
    \ failure and stops the packet transmission.  The same\n   mechanism is used for\
    \ failure within the MAPOS cloud (link 2).  When\n   a MAPOS switch is down, SSP\
    \ handles it as a topology change.\n              1                       2  \

    \ Path removal\n   A MAPOS/PPP tunneling path is removed by following steps.\n\
    \      a) Choose the path to remove, configure MAPOS switches on both\n      \
    \   ends of the path to disable the ports connected to the CPEs.\n      b) Path\
    \ database may be updated that the path is removed.\n      c) When CPE is detached,\
    \ port may be reset to MAPOS default\n         configurations.\n   Frames arriving\
    \ after the destination port was disabled should be\n   silently discarded and\
    \ should not be forwarded to the port.\n"
- title: 2.3.5 Provisioning and Design Consideration
  contents:
  - "2.3.5 Provisioning and Design Consideration\n   Because MAPOS does not have any\
    \ QoS control at its protocol level,\n   and POS does not have flow-control feature,\
    \ it is difficult to\n   guarantee end-end throughput.  Sufficient bandwidth for\
    \ inter-switch\n   link should be prepared to support all paths on the link.\n\
    \   Switches are recommended to ensure per-port fairness using any\n   appropriate\
    \ queuing algorithm.  This is especially important for\n   over-subscribed configuration,\
    \ for example to have more than 16 OC12c\n   paths on one OC192c inter-switch\
    \ link.\n   Although MAPOS v1 can be applied to the MAPOS/PPP tunneling mode,\n\
    \   MAPOS 16 is recommended for ease of address management.\n   Automatic switch\
    \ address negotiation mechanism is not suitable for\n   the MAPOS/PPP tunneling\
    \ mode, because the path management mechanism\n   becomes much more complex.\n"

- title: 4. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Security Considerations\n   There is no way to control or attack a MAPOS network\
    \ from CPE side\n   under PPP tunneling mode.  It is quite difficult to inject\
    \ other\n   stream because it is completely transparent from the viewpoint of\
    \ the\n   CPE.  However, operators must carefully avoid misconfiguration such\n\
    \   as path duplication.  Per-path isolation is extremely important;\n   switches\
    \ are recommended to implement this feature (like VLAN\n   mechanism).\n   In\
    \ addition, potential vulnerability still exists in a mixed\n   environment where\
    \ PPP tunneling mode and MAPOS native mode coexists\n   in the same network. \
    \ Use of such environment is not recommended,\n   until an isolation feature is\
    \ implemented in all MAPOS switches in\n   the network.  Note that there is no\
    \ source address field in the MAPOS\n   framing, which may make path isolation\
    \ difficult in a mixed MAPOS/PPP\n   environment.\n"
