  - "1.  Introduction\n   Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access
    (PANA)\n   [RFC5191] is a UDP-based protocol to perform Extensible\n   Authentication
    Protocol (EAP) authentication between a PANA Client\n   (PaC) and a PANA Authentication
    Agent (PAA).\n   This document specifies PANA Relay Element (PRE) functionality,
    which\n   enables PANA messaging between a PaC and a PAA where the two nodes\n
    \  cannot reach each other by means of regular IP routing.  For example,\n   in
    ZigBee IP [ZIGBEEIP] that uses 6LoWPAN [RFC4944], a joining node\n   (PaC) can
    only use a link-local IPv6 address to communicate with a\n   parent node prior
    to PANA authentication.  The PAA typically resides\n   in a 6LowPAN Border Router
    (6LBR) [6LoWPAN-ND], which is often\n   multiple IP hops away from the PaC.  The
    PRE implemented on the\n   parent node is used for relaying PANA messages between
    the PaC and\n   the PAA in this scenario.\n"

  title: 1.1.  Specification of Requirements
- contents:
  - "2.  PANA Relay Element\n   A PANA Relay Element (PRE) is a node that is located
    between a PaC\n   and a PAA.  It is responsible for relaying the PANA messages
    between\n   the PaC and the PAA.  The PRE does not need to maintain per-PaC\n
    \  state.  From the PaC's perspective, the PRE appears as the PAA.\n   Normal
    IP routing is performed between the PRE and the PAA.  A PAA\n   can communicate
    with multiple PREs.  A PRE can communicate with\n   multiple PAAs, and it will
    choose one PAA to communicate with for a\n   given PaC.  By default, the PaC discovers
    the PRE using the normal\n   mechanism for PAA discovery as defined in [RFC5192].
    \ PREs are\n   assumed to be configured with the IP address(es) of the PAA(s).\n
    \  Dynamic PAA discovery schemes for PREs are outside the scope of this\n   document.\n
    \  The PRE and the PAA support the relay operation as follows.\n   When the PRE
    receives a PANA message from the PaC, it creates a PANA-\n   Relay (PRY) message
    (see Section 4.1) containing a Relayed-Message\n   AVP (see Section 5.2) and a
    PaC-Information AVP (see Section 5.1).\n   The Relayed-Message AVP encapsulates
    the entire PANA Message received\n   from the PaC.  The PaC-Information AVP contains
    the PaC's IP address\n   and UDP port number used for sending the PANA messages.
    \ The PRY\n   message is sent to the PAA.\n   When the PAA receives the PRY message,
    it retrieves the PaC-\n   originated PANA message from the Relayed-Message AVP
    and the PaC's IP\n   address and UDP port number from the PaC-Information AVP.
    \ The PaC-\n   originated PANA message is processed in the same way as specified
    in\n   [RFC5191], with the following exceptions:\n   (a) The IP address and the
    port number contained in the PaC-\n       Information AVP and the source IP address
    and UDP port number of\n       the PRE are used to identify the PaC among multiple
    PANA-Client-\n       Initiation messages sent from different PaCs through the
    same PRE\n       or sent from more than one PaC with the same the IP address and\n
    \      the port number through different PREs.\n   (b) The IP address and the
    port number contained in the PaC-\n       Information AVP are maintained by the
    PAA in the PANA session\n       attribute \"IP address and UDP port number of
    the PaC\" [RFC5191].\n   (c) The IP address and UDP port number of the PRE are
    maintained by\n       the PAA in a new PANA session attribute \"IP address and
    UDP port\n       number of the PRE\".  A PANA session is referred to as a relayed\n
    \      PANA session if this attribute has a non-null value.\n   When the PAA originates
    a PANA message for a relayed PANA session, it\n   sends a PRY message to the PRE's
    IP address and sets the destination\n   UDP port number to the UDP port number
    of the PRE maintained in the\n   PANA session attribute \"IP address and UDP port
    number of the PRE\".\n   The PRY message includes a Relayed-Message AVP containing
    the PAA-\n   originated PANA message and also includes a PaC-Information AVP\n
    \  containing the PaC's IP address and UDP port number.\n   When the PRE receives
    the PRY message, it retrieves the PAA-\n   originated PANA message from the Relayed-Message
    AVP and the PaC's IP\n   address and UDP port number from and PaC-Information
    AVPs.  The PAA-\n   originated PANA message is sent to the PaC's IP address with
    the\n   source UDP port number set to the PANA port number (716) and the\n   destination
    UDP port number set to the UDP port number contained in\n   the Relayed-Message
    AVP.\n   The Session Identifier and Sequence Number of any PRY message are set\n
    \  to zero.  PRY messages are never retransmitted by the PRE or the PAA.\n   Note
    that the PANA message carried in a Relayed-Message AVP may be\n   retransmitted
    by the PaC or PAA, leading to transmission of a new PRY\n   message carrying the
    same Relayed-Message AVP.\n   A PAA that supports this specification MUST be able
    to process PRY\n   messages for PaC-initiated PANA sessions.\n   This specification
    assumes there is at most one PRE between the PaC\n   and the PAA.  Performing
    relay operation on a PANA message that is\n   already relayed (i.e., carried inside
    a PRY message) is out of scope\n   of this specification.\n   Figure 1 is an example
    message flow with a PRE.\n    PaC        PRE                          PAA   srcIP:port->dstIP:port\n

  - "3.  Security of Messages Sent between PRE and PAA\n   PRE/PAA security is OPTIONAL
    since PANA messages are designed to be\n   used in untrusted networks, but if
    a cryptographic mechanism is\n   supported, it SHOULD be IPsec.  When the device
    characteristics\n   preclude support for IPsec, an alternative mechanism such
    as DTLS\n   [RFC4347], or link-layer cryptographic security, etc., may be used\n
    \  instead.  This section describes how IPsec [RFC4301] can be used for\n   securing
    the PANA relay messages.\n   When IPsec is used, each PRE must have an established
    pairwise trust\n   relationship with a PAA.  That is, if messages from a PaC will
    be\n   relayed by a PRE to a PAA, the PRE and PAA must be configured to use\n
    \  IPsec for the messages they exchange.\n   PREs and PAAs that support secure
    PRE to PAA communication use IPsec\n   under the following conditions:\n   Selectors
    \       PREs are manually configured with the addresses of\n                    the
    PAAs to which PANA messages are to be forwarded.\n                    PAAs that
    will be using IPsec for securing PANA\n                    messages must also
    be configured with a list of the\n                    PREs to which messages will
    be returned.  The\n                    selectors for the PREs and PAAs will be
    the pairs of\n                    addresses defining PREs and PAAs that exchange
    PANA\n                    messages on the PANA UDP port 716 in their source or\n
    \                   destination port.\n   Mode             PREs and PAAs use transport
    mode and ESP.  The\n                    information in PANA messages is not generally\n
    \                   considered confidential, so encryption need not be\n                    used
    (i.e., NULL encryption can be used).\n   Key management   Because the PREs and
    PAA must be manually\n                    configured, manually configured key
    management may\n                    suffice, but does not provide defense against\n
    \                   replayed messages.  Accordingly, IKE with preshared\n                    secrets
    SHOULD be supported.  IKE with public keys\n                    MAY be supported.\n
    \  Security policy  PANA messages between PREs and PAAs should only be\n                    accepted
    from PANA peers as identified in the local\n                    configuration.\n
    \  Authentication   Shared keys, indexed to the source IP address of the\n                    received
    PANA message, are adequate in this\n                    application.\n   Availability
    \    Appropriate IPsec implementations are likely to be\n                    available
    for PAAs and for PREs in more featureful\n                    devices used in
    enterprise and core ISP networks.\n                    IPsec is less likely to
    be available for PREs in\n                    low-end devices primarily used in
    the home or small\n                    office markets.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   A PRE's main objective is to assist transport
    of PANA messages\n   between the PaC and the PAA.  Relay operation performed between
    the\n   PRE and the PAA forms an additional logical link for relaying the\n   end-to-end
    PANA messages between the PaC and the PAA.  In that sense,\n   a PRE resembles
    a bridge or a router that sits between the PaC and\n   the PAA when non-relayed
    PANA [RFC5191] is used.\n   A PRE can pose certain threats to the relayed PANA
    messages.  A PRE\n   can delay or drop PANA messages sent by the PaC or the PAA.
    \ It can\n   also spoof or modify PANA messages sent towards the PaC or the PAA.\n
    \  These threats are similar to what an on-path bridge/router (i.e., a\n   man-in-the-middle,
    MitM) can pose to non-relayed PANA.  EAP and PANA\n   protocols are designed to
    operate over unsecure links where\n   aforementioned threats can already exist.
    \ Even though these threats\n   cannot be leveraged to gain unauthorized network
    access, or\n   compromise of cryptographic keys (e.g., MK, MSK, EMSK, etc.), other\n
    \  damages such as preventing authentication to complete, or denial-of\n   service
    are still possible.\n   Even though the PRE-to-PAA relay path appears to be a
    separate\n   additional logical link for transporting the PANA messages, the PRE\n
    \  may pose a few additional risks versus traditional on-path bridges\n   and
    routers.  The following explains the risks and mitigations of PRE\n   as a relay
    device.\n   The PRE inserts PaC-Information AVP as the PaC-generated PANA packet\n
    \  is encapsulated in a PRY packet to the PAA.  This AVP carries the IP\n   address
    and the UDP port number values of the PANA packet as sent by\n   the PAC.  These
    values are already carried inside the IP and UDP\n   headers with non-relayed
    PANA and they are not necessarily secured.\n   EAP and PANA are designed to work
    in the absence of their protection.\n   Therefore, no additional PANA-layer security
    is needed when these\n   values are carried as PANA AVPs between the PRE and the
    PAA.  If a\n   future document defines additional payload AVPs for the PRY messages,\n
    \  there may be a need to define additional security for those messages.\n   A
    rogue PRE can spoof PANA messages on behalf of a victim PaC and\n   receive the
    PAA response irrespective of the location of the PRE with\n   respect to the network
    topology.  Achieving the same threat with non-\n   relayed PANA requires the rogue
    node be an MitM, otherwise the\n   spoofed packets may be dropped by the ingress
    filtering network\n   elements, or the responses would be directly sent to the
    victim PaC\n   IP address and may not be received by the rogue node.  Nevertheless,\n
    \  such a rogue PRE cannot perform full initial authentication on behalf\n   of
    the victim PaC unless it also holds the PaC's credentials\n   (including the master
    key).  Furthermore, any spoofed PANA messages\n   after the initial authentication
    will fail the integrity checks at\n   the PAA when a key-generating EAP method
    is used.\n   The only state that can change on the PAA upon a rogue PRE sending
    a\n   spoofed PRY is the IP address and UDP port number of the PRE stored\n   as
    PANA session attributes, which impacts where the PAA sends the\n   next PANA packet
    (i.e., to the rogue PRE instead of the legitimate\n   PRE).  The PAA also needs
    to handle the PaC-Information AVP in\n   addition to the PaC-originated PANA message
    carried in the Relayed-\n   Message AVP, so use of the PRE may impose additional
    storage\n   requirements on the PAA.  A rogue PRE generating a valid PANA packet\n
    \  requires it be a MitM in order to synch up with the PANA session\n   state
    and attributes on the PaC.  Such a MitM can already disturb the\n   EAP and PANA
    even without playing the role of a PRE.\n   An unauthorized node pretending as
    PAA can spoof the relayed PANA\n   messages to the PRE in order to get them delivered
    to the PaC.  While\n   the harm caused by such spoofed packets are limited (due
    to the EAP\n   and PANA design with unsecured network operation in mind), the\n
    \  processing of bogus packets can cause processing load on the PaC.\n   Some
    of the risks stemming from the aforementioned threats are\n   already handled
    by the EAP and PANA as described.  The residual risks\n   shall be mitigated using
    additional physical or cryptographic\n   security in the network hosting the PREs
    and the PAAs.  Access\n   control lists implemented on the PRE, PAA, or intermediary
    firewalls\n   supported by cryptographic or physical authentication/authorization\n
    \  are needed for protecting legitimate PRE and PAAs against rogue ones.\n   Details
    of the cryptographic mechanisms using IPsec are specified in\n   Section 3.  Use
    of manually configured preshared keys for IPsec\n   between PREs and PAAs does
    not defend against replayed PANA messages.\n   PREs do not need to maintain per-PaC
    state; therefore, they are\n   robust against resource consumption DoS (Denial-of-Service)
    attacks.\n   In the relay operation, the IP address of the PAA that is seen by
    the\n   PaC (i.e., an IP address of the PRE) is different from the IP address\n
    \  of the PAA that is seen by the authentication server.  If an EAP\n   channel
    binding solution uses the IP address of the PAA as part of\n   channel binding
    parameters, such a solution must take this into\n   account.  Note that the same
    issue arises even when non-relayed PANA\n   is used and the PAA has one IP address
    configured on its interface\n   facing the PaC and another IP address on the other
    interface facing\n   the authentication server.\n"
