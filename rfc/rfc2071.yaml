  - "1. Introduction\n   The popularity of connecting to the global Internet over\
    \ the course\n   of the past several years has spawned new problems; what most\
    \ people\n   casually refer to as \"growing pains\" can be attributed to more\
    \ basic\n   problems in understanding the requirements for Internet connectivity.\n\
    \   However, the reasons why organizations may need to renumber their\n   networks\
    \ can greatly vary. We'll discuss these issues in some amount\n   of detail below.\

- title: 2. Background
  contents:
  - "2. Background\n   The ability for any network or interconnected devices, such\
    \ as\n   desktop PCs or workstations, to obtain connectivity to any potential\n\
    \   destination in the global Internet is reliant upon the possession of\n   unique\
    \ IP host addresses [1].  A duplicate host address that is being\n   used elsewhere\
    \ in the Internet could best be described as\n   problematic, since the presence\
    \ of duplicate addresses would cause\n   one of the destinations to be unreachable\
    \ from some origins in the\n   Internet.  It should be noted, however, that globally\
    \ unique IP\n   addresses are not always necessary, and is dependent on the\n\
    \   connectivity requirements [2].\n   However, the recent popularity in obtaining\
    \ Internet connectivity has\n   made these types of connectivity dependencies\
    \ unpredictable, and\n   conventional wisdom in the Internet community dictates\
    \ that the\n   various address allocation registries, such as the InterNIC, as\
    \ well\n   as the ISP's, become more prudent in their address allocation\n   strategies.\
    \  In that vein, the InterNIC has defined address\n   allocation policies [3]\
    \ wherein the majority of address allocations\n   for end-user networks are accommodated\
    \ by their upstream ISP, except\n   in cases where dual- or multihoming and very\
    \ large blocks of\n   addresses are required.  With this allocation policy becoming\n\
    \   standard current practice, it presents unique problems regarding the\n   portability\
    \ of addresses from one provider to another.\n   As a practical matter, end users\
    \ cannot assume they \"own\" address\n   allocations, if their intention is to\
    \ be to have full connectivity to\n   the global Internet. Rather, end users will\
    \ \"borrow\" part of the\n   address space of an upstream provider's allocation.\
    \ The larger\n   provider block from which their space is suballocated will have\
    \ been\n   assigned in a manner consistent with global Internet routing.\n   Not\
    \ having \"permanent\" addresses does not mean users will not have\n   unique\
    \ identifiers. Such identifiers are typically Domain Name System\n   (DNS) [4]\
    \ names for endpoints such as servers and workstations.\n   Mechanisms such as\
    \ the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [5]\n   can help automate the\
    \ assignment and maintenance of host names, as\n   well as the 'borrowed' addresses\
    \ required for routing-level\n   connectivity.\n   The PIER Working Group is developing\
    \ procedures and guidelines for\n   detailed renumbering of specific technologies,\
    \ such as routers [6].\n   PIER WG documents are intended to suggest methods both\
    \ for making\n   existing networks prepared for convenient renumbering, as well\
    \ as for\n   operational transition to new addressing schemes.\n   Also, in many\
    \ instances, organizations who have never connected to\n   the Internet, yet have\
    \ been using arbitrary blocks of addresses since\n   their construction, have\
    \ different and unique challenges.\n"
- title: 3. Network Renumbering Defined
  contents:
  - "3. Network Renumbering Defined\n   In the simplest of definitions, the exercise\
    \ of renumbering a network\n   consists of changing the IP host addresses, and\
    \ perhaps the network\n   mask, of each device within the network that has an\
    \ address\n   associated with it. This activity may or may not consist of all\n\
    \   networks within a particular domain, such as FOO.EDU, or networks\n   which\
    \ comprise an entire autonomous system.\n   Devices which may need to be renumbered,\
    \ for example, are networked\n   PC's, workstations, printers, file servers, terminal\
    \ servers, and\n   routers. Renumbering a network may involve changing host parameters\n\
    \   and configuration files which contain IP addresses, such as\n   configuration\
    \ files which contain addresses of DNS and other servers,\n   addresses contained\
    \ in SNMP [7] management stations, and addresses\n   configured in access control\
    \ lists. While this is not an all-\n   inclusive list, the PIER working group\
    \ is making efforts to compile\n   documentation to identify these devices in\
    \ a more detailed fashion.\n   Network renumbering need not be sudden activity,\
    \ either; in most\n   instances, an organization's upstream service provider(s)\
    \ will allow\n   a grace period where both the \"old\" addresses and the \"new\"\
    \ addresses\n   may be used in parallel.\n"

  - "4. Reasons for Renumbering\n   The following sections discuss particular reasons\
    \ which may\n   precipitate network renumbering, and are not presented in any\n\
    \   particular order of precedence.  They are grouped into reasons that\n   primarily\
    \ reflect decisions made in the past, operational\n   requirements of the present,\
    \ or plans for the future.\n   Some of these requirements reflect evolution in\
    \ the organization's\n   mission, such as a need to communicate with business\
    \ partners, or to\n   work efficiently in a global Internet.  Other requirements\
    \ reflect\n   changes in network technologies.\n"
- title: 4.1  Past
  contents:
  - "4.1  Past\n   Many organizations implemented IP-based networks not for connectivity\n\
    \   to the Internet, but simply to make use of effective data\n   communications\
    \ mechanisms.  These organizations subsequently found\n   valid reasons to connect\
    \ to other organizations or the Internet in\n   general, but found the address\
    \ structures they chose incompatible\n   with overall Internet practice.\n   Other\
    \ organizations connected early to the Internet, but did so at a\n   time when\
    \ address space was not scarce.  Yet other organizations\n   still have no requirement\
    \ to connect to the Internet, but have legacy\n   addressing structures that do\
    \ not scale to adequate size.\n"
- title: 4.1.1  Initial addressing using non-unique addresses
  contents:
  - "4.1.1  Initial addressing using non-unique addresses\n   As recently as two years\
    \ ago, many organizations had no intention of\n   connecting to the Internet,\
    \ and constructed their corporate or\n   organizational network(s) using unregistered,\
    \ non-unique network\n   addresses.  Obviously, as most problems evolve, these\
    \ same\n   organizations determined that Internet connectivity had become a\n\
    \   valuable asset, and subsequently discovered that they could no longer\n  \
    \ use the same unregistered, non-unique network addresses that were\n   previously\
    \ deployed throughout their organization.  Thus, the labor\n   of renumbering\
    \ to valid network addresses is now upon them, as they\n   move to connect to\
    \ the global Internet.\n   While obtaining valid, unique addresses is certainly\
    \ required to\n   obtain full Internet connectivity in most circumstances, the\
    \ number\n   of unique addresses required can be significantly reduced by the\n\
    \   implementation of Network Address Translation (NAT) devices [8] and\n   the\
    \ use of private address space, as specified in [9].  NAT reduces\n   not only\
    \ the number of required unique addresses, but also localizes\n   the changes\
    \ required by renumbering.\n   It should also be noted that NAT technology may\
    \ not always be a\n   viable option, depending upon scale of addressing, performance\
    \ or\n   topological constraints.\n"
- title: 4.1.2  Legacy address allocation
  contents:
  - "4.1.2  Legacy address allocation\n   There are also several instances where organizations\
    \ were originally\n   allocated very large amounts of address space, such as traditional\n\
    \   \"Class A\" or \"Class B\" allocations, while the actual address\n   requirements\
    \ are much less than the total amount of address space\n   originally allocated.\
    \  In many cases, these organizations could\n   suffice with a smaller CIDR allocation,\
    \ and utilize the allocated\n   address space in a more efficient manner.  As\
    \ allocation requirements\n   become more stringent, mechanisms to review how\
    \ these organizations\n   are utilizing their address space could, quite possibly,\
    \ result in a\n   request to return the original allocation to a particular registry\n\
    \   and renumber with a more appropriately sized address block.\n"
- title: 4.1.3  Limitations of Bridged Internetworks
  contents:
  - "4.1.3  Limitations of Bridged Internetworks\n   Bridging has a long and distinguished\
    \ history in legacy networks.  As\n   networks grow, however, traditional bridged\
    \ networks reach\n   performance- and stability-related limits, including (but\
    \ not limited\n   to) broadcast storms.\n   Early routers did not have the speed\
    \ to handle the needs of some\n   large networks.  Some organizations were literally\
    \ not able to move\n   to routers until router forwarding performance improved\
    \ to be\n   comparable to bridges.  Now that routers are of comparable or\n  \
    \ superior speed, and offer more robust features, replacing bridged\n   networks\
    \ becomes reasonable.\n   IP addresses assigned to pure bridged networks tend\
    \ not to be\n   subnetted, yet subnetting is a basic approach for router networks.\n\
    \   Introducing subnetting is a practical necessity in moving from\n   bridging\
    \ to routing.\n   Special cases of bridging are realized in workgroup switching\n\
    \   systems, discussed below.\n"

    \ come from routing mechanisms that\n   advertise excessive numbers of routing\
    \ updates (e.g., RIP, IGRP).\n   Likewise, appropriate replacement protocols (e.g.,\
    \ OSPF, EIGRP, S-IS)\n   will work best with a structured addressing system that\
    \ encourages\n   aggregation.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.5  Limitations of System Administration Methodologies\n   There can be operational\
    \ limits to growth based on the difficulty of\n   adds, moves and changes.  As\
    \ enterprise networks grow, it may be\n   necessary to delegate portions of address\
    \ assignment and maintenance.\n   If address space has been assigned randomly\
    \ or inefficiently, it may\n   be difficult to delegate portions of the address\
    \ space.\n   It is not unusual for organizational networks to grow sporadically,\n\
    \   obtaining an address prefix here and there, in a non-contiguous\n   fashion.\
    \  Depending on the number of prefixes that an organization\n   acquires over\
    \ time, it may become increasingly unmanageable or demand\n   higher levels of\
    \ maintenance and administration when individual\n   prefixes are acquired in\
    \ this way.\n   Reasonable IP address management may in general simplify continuing\n\
    \   system administration; a good numbering plan is also a good\n   renumbering\
    \ plan.  Renumbering may force a discipline into system\n   administration that\
    \ will reduce long-term support costs.\n   It has been observed \"...there is\
    \ no way to renumber a network\n   without an inventory of the hosts (absent DHCP).\

- title: 4.2.3   Change of Internet Service Provider
  contents:
  - "4.2.3   Change of Internet Service Provider\n   As mentioned previously in Section\
    \ 2, it is increasingly becoming\n   current practice for organizations to have\
    \ their IP addresses\n   allocated by their upstream ISP.  Also, with the advent\
    \ of Classless\n   Inter Domain Routing (CIDR) [11], and the considerable growth\
    \ in the\n   size of the global Internet table, Internet Service Providers are\n\
    \   becoming more and more reluctant to allow customers to continue using\n  \
    \ addresses which were allocated by the ISP, when the customer\n   terminates\
    \ service and moves to another ISP.  The prevailing reason\n   is that the ISP\
    \ was previously issued a CIDR block of contiguous\n   address space, which can\
    \ be announced to the remainder of the\n   Internet community as a single prefix.\
    \ (A prefix is what is referred\n   to in classless terms as a contiguous block\
    \ of IP addresses.)  If a\n   non-customer advertises a specific component of\
    \ the CIDR block, then\n   this adds an additional routing entry to the global\
    \ Internet routing\n   table.  This is what is commonly referred to as \"punching\
    \ holes\" in a\n   CIDR block. Consequently, there are usually no routing anomalies\
    \ in\n   doing this since a specific prefix is always preferred over an\n   aggregate\
    \ route.  However, if this practice were to happen on a large\n   scale, the growth\
    \ of the global routing table would become much\n   larger, and perhaps too large\
    \ for current backbone routers to\n   accommodate in an acceptable fashion with\
    \ regards to performance of\n   recalculating routing information and sheer size\
    \ of the routing table\n   itself.  For obvious reasons, this practice is highly\
    \ discouraged by\n   ISP's with CIDR blocks, and some ISP's are making this a\
    \ contractual\n   issue, so that customers understand that addresses allocated\
    \ by the\n   ISP are non-portable.\n   It is noteworthy to mention that the likelihood\
    \ of being forced to\n   renumber in this situation is inversely proportional\
    \ to the size of\n   the customer's address space.  For example, an organization\
    \ with a\n   /16 allocation may be allowed to consider the address space\n   \"\
    portable\", while an organization with multiple non-contiguous /24\n   allocations\
    \ may not.  While the scenarios may be vastly different in\n   scope, it becomes\
    \ an issue to be decided at the discretion of the\n   initial allocating entity,\
    \ and the ISP's involved; the major deciding\n   factor being whether or not the\
    \ change will fragment an existing CIDR\n   block and whether it will significantly\
    \ contribute to the overall\n   growth of the global Internet routing tables.\n\
    \   It should also be noted that (contrary to opinions sometimes voiced)\n   this\
    \ form of renumbering is a technically necessary consequence of\n   changing ISP's,\
    \ rather than a commercial or political mandate.\n"

- title: 4.2.4  Internal Use of LAN Switching
  contents:
  - "4.2.4  Internal Use of LAN Switching\n   Introducing workgroup switches may introduce\
    \ subtle renumbering\n   needs.  Fundamentally, workgroup switches are specialized,\
    \ high-\n   performance bridges, which make their main forwarding decisions based\n\
    \   on Layer 2 (MAC) address information. Even so, they rarely are\n   independent\
    \ of Layer 3 (IP) address structure.  Pure Layer 2\n   switching has a \"flat\"\
    \ address space that will need to be renumbered\n   into a hierarchical, subnetted\
    \ space consistent with routing.\n   Introducing single switches or stacks of\
    \ switches may not have\n   significant impact on addressing, as long as it is\
    \ understood that\n   each system of switches is a single broadcast domain. Each\
    \ broadcast\n   domain should map to a single IP subnetwork.\n   Virtual LANs\
    \ (VLANs) further extend the complexity of the role of\n   workgroup switches.\
    \ It is generally true that moving an end station\n   from one switch port to\
    \ another within the same VLAN will not cause\n   major changes in addressing.\
    \ Many overview presentations of this\n   technology do not make it clear that\
    \ moving the same end station\n   between different VLANs will move the end station\
    \ into another IP\n   subnet, requiring a significant address change.\n   Switches\
    \ are commonly managed by SNMP applications. These network\n   management applications\
    \ communicate with managed devices using IP.\n   Even if the switch does not do\
    \ IP forwarding, it will itself need IP\n   addresses if it is to be managed.\
    \ Also, if the clients and servers in\n   the workgroup are managed by SNMP, they\
    \ will also require IP\n   addresses. The workgroup, therefore, will need to appear\
    \ as one or\n   more IP subnetworks.\n   Increasingly, internetworking products\
    \ are not purely Layer 2 or\n   Layer 3 devices. A workgroup switch product often\
    \ includes a routing\n   function, so the numbering plan must support both flat\
    \ Layer 2 and\n   hierarchical Layer 3 addressing.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.4  Internal Use of NBMA Cloud Services\n   \"Cloud\" services such as frame\
    \ relay often are more economical than\n   traditional services. At first glance,\
    \ when converting existing\n   enterprise networks to NBMA, it might appear that\
    \ the existing subnet\n   structure should be preserved, but this is often not\
    \ the case.\n   Many organizations often  began by treating the \"cloud\" as a\
    \ single\n   subnet, but experience has shown it is often better to treat the\n\
    \   individual virtual circuits as separate subnets, which appear as\n   traditional\
    \ point-to-point circuits.  When the individual point-to-\n   point VCs become\
    \ separate subnets, efficient address utilization\n   requires the use of long\
    \ prefixes (i.e., 30 bit) for these subnets.\n   In practice, obtaining 30 bit\
    \ prefixes means the logical network\n   should support variable length subnet\
    \ masks (VLSM).  VLSMs are the\n   primary method in which an assigned prefix\
    \ can be subnetted\n   efficiently for different media types. This is accomplished\
    \ by\n   establishing one or more prefix lengths for LAN media with more than\n\
    \   two hosts, and subdividing one or more of these shorter prefixes into\n  \
    \ longer /30 prefixes that minimize address loss.\n   There are alternative ways\

    \ point-to-multipoint VCs.\n   These often have a significant performance impact,\
    \ and may be less\n   reliable because a single routing point of failure is created.\n\
    \   Motivations for such alternatives tend to include:\n      1.  A desire not\
    \ to use VLSM. This is often founded in fear\n          rather than technology.\n\
    \      2.  Router implementation issues that limit the number of subnets\n   \
    \       or interfaces a given router can support.\n      3.  An inherently point-to-multipoint\

    \ can be accommodated with CIDR.  Also,\n   many organizations have begun to deploy\
    \ classless interior routing\n   protocols within their domains that make use\
    \ of route summarization\n   and other optimized routing features, effectively\
    \ reducing the total\n   number of routes being propagated within their internal\
    \ network(s),\n   and making it much easier to administer and maintain.\n   Hierarchical\
    \ routing protocols such as OSPF scale best when the\n   address assignment of\
    \ a given network reflects the topology, and the\n   topology of the network can\
    \ often be fluid. Given that the network is\n   fluid, even the best planned address\
    \ assignment scheme, given time,\n   will diverge from the actual topology. While\
    \ not required, some\n   organization may choose to gain the benefit of both technical\
    \ and\n   administrative scalability of their IGP by periodically renumbering\n\
    \   to have address assignments reflect the network topology. Patrick\n   Henry\
    \ once said \"the tree of liberty must from time to time be\n   watered with the\
    \ blood of patriots.\" In the Internet, routing trees\n   of the best-planned\
    \ networks need from time to time be watered with\n   at least the sweat of network\
    \ administrators.  Improving aggregation\n   is also highly encouraged to reduce\
    \ the size of not only the global\n   Internet routing table, but also the size\
    \ and scalability of interior\n   routing within the enterprise.\n"

- title: 4.3.1  Internal Use of Switched Virtual Circuit Services
  contents:
  - "4.3.1  Internal Use of Switched Virtual Circuit Services\n   Services such as\
    \ ATM virtual circuits, switched frame relay, etc.,\n   present challenges not\
    \ considered in the original IP design.  The\n   basic IP decision in forwarding\
    \ a packet is whether the destination\n   is local or remote, in relation to the\
    \ source host's subnet. Address\n   resolution mechanisms are used to find the\
    \ medium address of the\n   destination in the case of local destinations, or\
    \ to find the medium\n   address of the router in the case of remote routers.\n\
    \   In these new services, there are cases where it is far more effective\n  \
    \ to \"cut-through\" a new virtual circuit to the destination. If the\n   destination\
    \ is on a different subnet than the source, the cut-through\n   typically is to\
    \ the egress router that serves the destination subnet.\n   The advantage of cut-through\
    \ in such a case is that it avoids the\n   latency of multiple router hops, and\
    \ reduces load on \"backbone\"\n   routers. The cut-through decision is usually\
    \ made by an entry router\n   that is aware of both the routed and switched environments.\n\
    \   This entry router communicates with a address resolution server using\n  \
    \ the Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) [13]. This server maps the\n   destination\
    \ network address to either a next-hop router (where cut-\n   through is not appropriate)\
    \ or to an egress router reached over the\n   switched service. Obviously, the\
    \ data base in such a server may be\n   affected by renumbering. Clients may have\
    \ a hard-coded address of the\n   server, which again may need to change.  While\
    \ the NHRP protocol\n   specifications are still evolving at the time of this\
    \ writing,\n   commercial implementations based on drafts of the protocol standard\n\
    \   are in use.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.3.2  Transitioning to IP version 6\n   Of course, when IPv6 [14] deployment\
    \ is set in motion, and as\n   methodologies are developed to transition to IPv6,\
    \ renumbering will\n   also be necessary, but perhaps not immediately mandatory.\
    \  To aid in\n   the transition to IPv6, mechanisms to deploy dual- IPv4/IPv6\
    \ stacks\n   on network hosts should also become available. It is also envisioned\n\
    \   that Network Address Translation (NAT) devices will be developed to\n   assist\
    \ in the IPv4 to IPv6 transition, or perhaps supplant the need\n   to renumber\
    \ the majority of interior networks altogether, but that is\n   beyond the scope\
    \ of this document. At the very least, DNS hosts will\n   need to be reconfigured\
    \ to resolve new host names and addresses, and\n   routers will need to be reconfigured\
    \ to advertise new prefixes.\n   IPv6 address allocation will be managed by the\
    \ Internet Assigned\n   Numbers Authority (IANA) as set forth in [15].\n"
- title: 5. Summary
  contents:
  - "5. Summary\n   As indicated by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) in [16],\
    \ the\n   task of renumbering networks is becoming more widespread and\n   commonplace.\
    \  Although there are numerous reasons why an organization\n   would desire, or\
    \ be required to renumber, there are equally as many\n   reasons why address allocation\
    \ should be done with great care and\n   forethought at the onset, in order to\
    \ minimize the impact that\n   renumbering would have on the organization. Even\
    \ with the most\n   forethought and vision, however, an organization cannot foresee\
    \ the\n   possibility for renumbering. The best advice, in this case, is to be\n\
    \   prepared, and get ready for renumbering.\n"
- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   Although no obvious security issues are discussed\
    \ in this document,\n   it stands to reason that renumbering certain devices can\
    \ defeat\n   security systems designed and based on static IP host addresses.\n\
    \   Care should be exercised by the renumbering entity to ensure that all\n  \
    \ security systems deployed with the network(s) which may need to be\n   renumbered\
    \ be given special consideration and significant forethought\n   to provide continued\
    \ functionality and adequate security.\n"
