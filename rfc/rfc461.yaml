  - "                  TELNET Protocol Meeting Announcement\nSince the publication\
    \ of RFC #318 there have been a great number of\nproposals for changes and/or\
    \ extensions to the (still unofficial) TELNET\nProtocol. It now seems appropriate\
    \ to have a meeting of concerned\nparties to try, once again, to reach a consensus\
    \ position and define an\n\"official\" protocol (with perhaps, some room for optional\
    \ expansion).\nAccordingly, I hereby announce a TELNET Protocol meeting to be\
    \ held at\nUCLA on Monday, March 5. I  expect this to be a working meeting (rather\n\
    than a tutorial to bring new members of the network community up-to-\nspeed) and\
    \ therefore wish to invite the attendance of only those\nindividuals prepared\
    \ to discuss at LEAST those issues which have already\nbeen raised.  At a minimum,\
    \ attendees should be familiar with the\nfollowing:\n    RFC 318\n    RFC 328\n\
    \    RFC 340\n    RFC 357\n    RFC 393\n    RFC 426\n    RFC 435\nA familiarity\
    \ with deliberations of the TELNET Committee prior to RFC\n318 would probably\
    \ also be helpful.  Finally, attendees should be aware\nthat there are few (no?)\
    \ Hosts which follow the echo-control conventions\ndescribed in RFC 318.\nAnyone\
    \ wishing to attend this meeting should contact Alex McKenzie at\nBBN (NIC ident\
    \ aam) 50 Moulton Street, Cambridge, Mass. 02l38.  My\ntelephone number is\n \
    \   (617) 491-1850 ext. 441\nWhen there is some indication of the number of individuals\
    \ planning to\nattend, a meeting room will be selected, a time announced, etc.\n\
