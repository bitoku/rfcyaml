  - "1.  Provenance of This Document\n   In 2001, the IRTF Routing Research Group\
    \ (IRTF RRG) chairs, Abha\n   Ahuja and Sean Doran, decided to establish a sub-group\
    \ to look at\n   requirements for inter-domain routing (IDR).  A group of well-known\n\
    \   routing experts was assembled to develop requirements for a new\n   routing\
    \ architecture.  Their mandate was to approach the problem\n   starting from a\
    \ blank slate.  This group was free to take any\n   approach, including a revolutionary\
    \ approach, in developing\n   requirements for solving the problems they saw in\
    \ inter-domain\n   routing.  Their eventual approach documented requirements for\
    \ a\n   complete future routing and addressing architecture rather than just\n\
    \   the requirements for IDR.\n   Simultaneously, an independent effort was started\
    \ in Sweden with a\n   similar goal.  A team, calling itself Babylon, with participation\n\
    \   from vendors, service providers, and academia, assembled to\n   understand\
    \ the history of inter-domain routing, to research the\n   problems seen by the\
    \ service providers, and to develop a proposal of\n   requirements for a follow-on\
    \ to the current routing architecture.\n   This group's approach required an evolutionary\
    \ approach starting from\n   current routing architecture and practice.  In other\
    \ words, the group\n   limited itself to developing an evolutionary strategy and\n\
    \   consequently assumed that the architecture would probably remain\n   domain-based.\
    \  The Babylon group was later folded into the IRTF RRG\n   as Sub-Group B to\
    \ distinguish it from the original RRG Sub-Group A.\n   This document, which was\
    \ a part of Sub-Group B's output, provides a\n   snapshot of the state of Inter-Domain\
    \ Routing (IDR) at the time of\n   original writing (2001) with some minor updates\
    \ to take into account\n   developments since that date, bringing it up to date\
    \ in 2006.  The\n   development of the new requirements set was then motivated\
    \ by an\n   analysis of the problems that IDR has been encountering in the recent\n\
    \   past.  This document is intended as a counterpart to the Routing\n   Requirements\
    \ document (\"A Set of Possible Requirements for a Future\n   Routing Architecture\"\
    ), which documents the requirements for future\n   routing systems as captured\
    \ separately by the IRTF RRG Sub-Groups A\n   and B [RFC5772].\n   The IRTF RRG\
    \ supported publication of this document as a historical\n   record of the work\
    \ completed on the understanding that it does not\n   necessarily represent either\
    \ the latest technical understanding or\n   the technical consensus of the research\
    \ group at the time of\n   publication.  The document has had substantial review\
    \ by members of\n   the Babylon team, members of the IRTF RRG, and others over\
    \ the years.\n"
- title: 2.  Introduction

  - "2.  Introduction\n   For the greater part of its existence, the Internet has\
    \ used a\n   domain-oriented routing system whereby the routers and other nodes\n\
    \   making up the infrastructure are partitioned into a set of\n   administrative\
    \ domains, primarily along ownership lines.  Individual\n   routing domains (also\
    \ known as Autonomous Systems (ASs)), which maybe\n   a subset of an administrative\
    \ domain, are made up of a finite,\n   connected set of nodes (at least in normal\
    \ operation).  Each routing\n   domain is subject to a coherent set of routing\
    \ and other policies\n   managed by a single administrative authority.  The domains\
    \ are\n   interlinked to form the greater Internet, producing a very large\n \
    \  network: in practice, we have to treat this network as if it were\n   infinite\
    \ in extent as there is no central knowledge about the whole\n   network of domains.\
    \  An early presentation of the concept of routing\n   domains can be found in\
    \ Paul Francis' OSI routing architecture paper\n   from 1987 [Tsuchiya87] (Paul\
    \ Francis was formerly known as Paul\n   Tsuchiya).\n   The domain concept and\
    \ domain-oriented routing has become so\n   fundamental to Internet-routing thinking\
    \ that it is generally taken\n   as an axiom these days and not even defined again\
    \ (cf., [NewArch03]).\n   The issues discussed in the present document notwithstanding,\
    \ it has\n   proved to be a robust and successful architectural concept that\n\
    \   brings with it the possibility of using different routing mechanisms\n   and\
    \ protocols within the domains (intra-domain) and between the\n   domains (inter-domain).\
    \  This is an attractive division, because\n   intra-domain protocols can exploit\
    \ the well-known finite scope of the\n   domain and the mutual trust engendered\
    \ by shared ownership to give a\n   high degree of control to the domain administrators,\
    \ whereas inter-\n   domain routing lives in an essentially infinite region featuring\
    \ a\n   climate of distrust built on a multitude of competitive commercial\n \
    \  agreements and driven by less-than-fully-public policies from each\n   component\
    \ domain.  Of course, like any other assumption that has been\n   around for a\
    \ very long time, the domain concept should be reevaluated\n   to make sure that\
    \ it is still helping!\n   It is generally accepted that there are major shortcomings\
    \ in the\n   inter-domain routing of the Internet today and that these may result\n\
    \   in severe routing problems within an unspecified period of time.\n   Remedying\
    \ these shortcomings will require extensive research to tie\n   down the exact\
    \ failure modes that lead to these shortcomings and\n   identify the best techniques\
    \ to remedy the situation.  Comparatively,\n   intra-domain routing works satisfactorily,\
    \ and issues with intra-\n   domain routing are mainly associated with the interface\
    \ between\n   intra- and inter-domain routing.\n      Reviewer's Note: Even in\
    \ 2001, there was a wide difference of\n      opinion across the community regarding\
    \ the shortcomings of inter-\n      domain routing.  In the years between writing\
    \ and publication,\n      further analysis, changes in operational practice, alterations\
    \ to\n      the demands made on inter-domain routing, modifications made to\n\
    \      BGP and a recognition of the difficulty of finding a replacement\n    \
    \  may have altered the views of some members of the community.\n   Changes in\
    \ the nature and quality of the services that users want\n   from the Internet\
    \ are difficult to provide within the current\n   framework, as they impose requirements\
    \ never foreseen by the original\n   architects of the Internet routing system.\n\
    \   The kind of radical changes that have to be accommodated are\n   epitomized\
    \ by the advent of IPv6 and the application of IP mechanisms\n   to private commercial\
    \ networks that offer specific service guarantees\n   beyond the best-effort services\
    \ of the public Internet.  Major\n   changes to the inter-domain routing system\
    \ are inevitable to provide\n   an efficient underpinning for the radically changed\
    \ and increasingly\n   commercially-based networks that rely on the IP protocol\
    \ suite.\n   Current practice stresses the need to separate the concerns of the\n\
    \   control plane and the forwarding plane in a router: this document\n   will\
    \ follow this practice, but we still use the term \"routing\" as a\n   global\
    \ portmanteau to cover all aspects of the system.\n   This document provides a\
    \ historical perspective on the current state\n   of inter-domain routing and\
    \ its relationship to intra-domain routing\n   in Section 3 by revisiting the\
    \ previous IETF requirements document\n   intended to steer the development of\
    \ a future routing system.  These\n   requirements, which informed the design\
    \ of the Border Gateway\n   Protocol (BGP) in 1989, are contained in RFC 1126\
    \ -- \"Goals and\n   Functional Requirements for Inter-Autonomous System Routing\"\
    \n   [RFC1126].\n   Section 3 also looks at some other work on requirements for\
    \ domain-\n   based routing that was carried out before and after RFC 1126 was\n\
    \   published.  This work fleshes out the historical perspective and\n   provides\
    \ some additional insights into alternative approaches that\n   may be instructive\
    \ when building a new set of requirements.\n   The motivation for change and the\
    \ inspiration for some of the\n   requirements for new routing architectures derive\
    \ from the problems\n   attributable to the current domain-based routing system\
    \ that are\n   being experienced in the Internet today.  These will be discussed\
    \ in\n   Section 5.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Background
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Background\n   Today's Internet uses an addressing and routing structure\
    \ that has\n   developed in an ad hoc, more or less upwards-compatible fashion.\
    \  The\n   structure has progressed from supporting a non-commercial Internet\n\
    \   with a single administrative domain to a solution that is able to\n   control\
    \ today's multi-domain, federated Internet, carrying traffic\n   between the networks\
    \ of commercial, governmental, and not-for-profit\n   participants.  This is not\
    \ achieved without a great deal of 24/7\n   vigilance and operational activity\
    \ by network operators: Internet\n   routing often appears to be running close\
    \ to the limits of stability.\n   As well as directing traffic to its intended\
    \ endpoint, inter-domain\n   routing mechanisms are expected to implement a host\
    \ of domain-\n   specific routing policies for competing, communicating domains.\
    \  The\n   result is not ideal, particularly as regards inter-domain routing\n\
    \   mechanisms, but it does a pretty fair job at its primary goal of\n   providing\
    \ any-to-any connectivity to many millions of computers.\n   Based on a large\
    \ body of anecdotal evidence, but also on a growing\n   body of experimental evidence\
    \ [Labovitz02] and analytic work on the\n   stability of BGP under certain policy\
    \ specifications [Griffin99], the\n   main Internet inter-domain routing protocol,\
    \ BGP version 4 (BGP-4),\n   appears to have a number of problems.  These problems\
    \ are discussed\n   in more detail in Section 5.  Additionally, the hierarchical\
    \ nature\n   of the inter-domain routing problem appears to be changing as the\n\
    \   connectivity between domains becomes increasingly meshed [RFC3221],\n   which\
    \ alters some of the scaling and structuring assumptions on which\n   BGP-4 is\
    \ built.  Patches and fix-ups may relieve some of these\n   problems, but others\
    \ may require a new architecture and new\n   protocols.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  The Legacy of RFC 1126\n   RFC 1126 [RFC1126] outlined a set of requirements\
    \ that were intended\n   to guide the development of BGP.\n      Editors' Note:\
    \ When this document was reviewed by Yakov Rekhter,\n      one of the designers\
    \ of BGP, his view was that \"While some people\n      expected a set of requirements\
    \ outlined in RFC 1126 to guide the\n      development of BGP, in reality the\
    \ development of BGP happened\n      completely independently of RFC 1126.  In\
    \ other words, from the\n      point of view of the development of BGP, RFC 1126\
    \ turned out to be\n      totally irrelevant\".  On the other hand, it appears\
    \ that BGP, as\n      currently implemented, has met a large proportion of these\n\
    \      requirements, especially for unicast traffic.\n   While the network is\
    \ demonstrably different from what it was in 1989,\n   having:\n   o  moved from\
    \ single to multiple administrative control,\n   o  increased in size by several\
    \ orders of magnitude, and\n   o  migrated from a fairly tree-like connectivity\
    \ graph to a meshier\n      style\n   many of the same requirements remain.  As\
    \ a first step in setting\n   requirements for the future, we need to understand\
    \ the requirements\n   that were originally set for the current protocols.  In\
    \ charting a\n   future architecture, we must first be sure to do no harm.  This\
    \ means\n   a future domain-based routing system has to support, as its base\n\
    \   requirement, the level of function that is available today.\n   The following\
    \ sections each relate to a requirement, or non-\n   requirement listed in RFC\
    \ 1126.  In fact, the section names are\n   direct quotes from the document. \
    \ The discussion of these\n   requirements covers the following areas:\n   Explanation:\
    \       Optional interpretation for today's audience of\n                    \
    \  the original intent of the requirement.\n   Relevance:         Is the requirement\
    \ of RFC 1126 still relevant, and\n                      to what degree?  Should\
    \ it be understood\n                      differently in today's environment?\n\

- title: 3.2.  ISO OSI IDRP, BGP, and the Development of Policy Routing
  contents:
  - "3.2.  ISO OSI IDRP, BGP, and the Development of Policy Routing\n   During the\
    \ decade before the widespread success of the World Wide\n   Web, ISO was developing\
    \ the communications architecture and protocol\n   suite Open Systems Interconnection\
    \ (OSI).  For a considerable part of\n   this time, OSI was seen as a possible\
    \ competitor for and even a\n   replacement for the IP suite as this basis for\
    \ the Internet.  The\n   technical developments of the two protocols were quite\
    \ heavily\n   interrelated with each providing ideas and even components that\
    \ were\n   adapted into the other suite.\n   During the early stages of the development\
    \ of OSI, the IP suite was\n   still mainly in use on the ARPANET and the relatively\
    \ small scale\n   first phase NSFNET.  This was effectively a single administrative\n\
    \   domain with a simple tree-structured network in a three-level\n   hierarchy\
    \ connected to a single logical exchange point (the NSFNET\n   backbone).  In\
    \ the second half of the 1980s, the NSFNET was starting\n   on the growth and\
    \ transformation that would lead to today's Internet.\n   It was becoming clear\
    \ that the backbone routing protocol, the\n   Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)\
    \ [RFC0904], was not going to cope even\n   with the limited expansion being planned.\
    \  EGP is an \"all informed\"\n   protocol that needed to know the identities\
    \ of all gateways, and this\n   was no longer reasonable.  With the increasing\
    \ complexity of the\n   NSFNET and the linkage of the NSFNET network to other\
    \ networks, there\n   was a desire for policy-based routing that would allow administrators\n\
    \   to manage the flow of packets between networks.  The first version of\n  \
    \ the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP-1) [RFC1105] was developed as a\n   replacement\
    \ for EGP with policy capabilities -- a stopgap EGP version\n   3 had been created\
    \ as an interim measure while BGP was developed.\n   BGP was designed to work\
    \ on a hierarchically structured network, such\n   as the original NSFNET, but\
    \ could also work on networks that were at\n   least partially non-hierarchical\
    \ where there were links between ASs\n   at the same level in the hierarchy (we\
    \ would now call these \"peering\n   arrangements\") although the protocol made\
    \ a distinction between\n   different kinds of links (links are classified as\
    \ upwards, downwards,\n   or sideways).  ASs themselves were a \"fix\" for the\
    \ complexity that\n   developed in the three-tier structure of the NSFNET.\n \
    \  Meanwhile, the OSI architects, led by Lyman Chapin, were developing a\n   much\
    \ more general architecture for large-scale networks.  They had\n   recognized\
    \ that no one node, especially an end-system (host), could\n   or should attempt\
    \ to remember routes from \"here\" to \"anywhere\" --\n   this sounds obvious\
    \ today, but was not so obvious 20 years ago.  They\n   were also considering\
    \ hierarchical networks with independently\n   administered domains -- a model\
    \ already well entrenched in the\n   public-switched telephone network.  This\
    \ led to a vision of a network\n   with multiple independent administrative domains\
    \ with an arbitrary\n   interconnection graph and a hierarchy of routing functionality.\
    \  This\n   architecture was fairly well established by 1987 [Tsuchiya87].  The\n\
    \   architecture initially envisaged a three-level routing functionality\n   hierarchy\
    \ in which each layer had significantly different\n   characteristics:\n   1.\
    \  *End-system to intermediate system (IS) routing (host to\n       router)*,\
    \ in which the principal functions are discovery and\n       redirection.\n  \
    \ 2.  *Intra-domain IS-IS routing (router to router)*, in which \"best\"\n   \
    \    routes between end-systems in a single administrative domain are\n      \
    \ computed and used.  A single algorithm and routing protocol would\n       be\
    \ used throughout any one domain.\n   3.  *Inter-domain IS-IS routing (router\
    \ to router)*, in which routes\n       between routing domains within administrative\
    \ domains are\n       computed (routing is considered separately between administrative\n\
    \       domains and routing domains).\n   Level 3 of this hierarchy was still\
    \ somewhat fuzzy.  Tsuchiya says:\n      The last two components, Inter-Domain\
    \ and Inter-Administration\n      routing, are less clear-cut.  It is not obvious\
    \ what should be\n      standardized with respect to these two components of routing.\
    \  For\n      example, for Inter-Domain routing, what can be expected from the\n\
    \      Domains?  By asking Domains to provide some kind of external\n      behavior,\
    \ we limit their autonomy.  If we expect nothing of their\n      external behavior,\
    \ then routing functionality will be minimal.\n      Across administrations, it\
    \ is not known how much trust there will\n      be.  In fact, the definition of\
    \ trust itself can only be\n      determined by the two or more administrations\
    \ involved.\n      Fundamentally, the problem with Inter-Domain and Inter-\n \
    \     Administration routing is that autonomy and mistrust are both\n      antithetical\
    \ to routing.  Accomplishing either will involve a\n      number of tradeoffs\
    \ which will require more knowledge about the\n      environments within which\
    \ they will operate.\n   Further refinement of the model occurred over the next\
    \ couple of\n   years and a more fully formed view is given by Huitema and Dabbous\
    \ in\n   1989 [Huitema90].  By this stage, work on the original IS-IS link-\n\
    \   state protocol, originated by the Digital Equipment Corporation\n   (DEC),\
    \ was fairly advanced and was close to becoming a Draft\n   International Standard.\
    \  IS-IS is of course a major component of\n   intra-domain routing today and\
    \ inspired the development of the Open\n   Shortest Path First (OSPF) family.\
    \  However, Huitema and Dabbous were\n   not able to give any indication of protocol\
    \ work for Level 3.  There\n   are hints of possible use of centralized route\
    \ servers.\n   In the meantime, the NSFNET consortium and the IETF had been\n\
    \   struggling with the rapid growth of the NSFNET.  It had been clear\n   since\
    \ fairly early on that EGP was not suitable for handling the\n   expanding network\
    \ and the race was on to find a replacement.  There\n   had been some intent to\
    \ include a metric in EGP to facilitate routing\n   decisions, but no agreement\
    \ could be reached on how to define the\n   metric.  The lack of trust was seen\
    \ as one of the main reasons that\n   EGP could not establish a globally acceptable\
    \ routing metric: again\n   this seems to be a clearly futile aim from this distance\
    \ in time!\n   Consequently, EGP became effectively a rudimentary path-vector\n\
    \   protocol that linked gateways with Autonomous Systems.  It was\n   totally\
    \ reliant on the tree-structured network to avoid routing\n   loops, and the all-informed\
    \ nature of EGP meant that update packets\n   became very large.  BGP version\
    \ 1 [RFC1105] was standardized in 1989,\n   but it had been in development for\
    \ some time before this and had\n   already seen action in production networks\
    \ prior to standardization.\n   BGP was the first real path-vector routing protocol\
    \ and was intended\n   to relieve some of the scaling problems as well as providing\
    \ policy-\n   based routing.  Routes were described as paths along a \"vector\"\
    \ of\n   ASs without any associated cost metric.  This way of describing\n   routes\
    \ was explicitly intended to allow detection of routing loops.\n   It was assumed\
    \ that the intra-domain routing system was loop-free\n   with the implication\
    \ that the total routing system would be loop-free\n   if there were no loops\
    \ in the AS path.  Note that there were no\n   theoretical underpinnings for this\
    \ work, and it traded freedom from\n   routing loops for guaranteed convergence.\n\
    \   Also, the NSFNET was a government-funded research and education\n   network.\
    \  Commercial companies that were partners in some of the\n   projects were using\
    \ the NSFNET for their research activities, but it\n   was becoming clear that\
    \ these companies also needed networks for\n   commercial traffic.  NSFNET had\
    \ put in place \"acceptable use\"\n   policies that were intended to limit the\
    \ use of the network.\n   However, there was little or no technology to support\
    \ the legal\n   framework.\n   Practical experience, IETF IAB discussion (centered\
    \ in the Internet\n   Architecture Task Force) and the OSI theoretical work were\
    \ by now\n   coming to the same conclusions:\n   o  Networks were going to be\
    \ composed out of multiple administrative\n      domains (the federated network),\n\
    \   o  The connections between these domains would be an arbitrary graph\n   \
    \   and certainly not a tree,\n   o  The administrative domains would wish to\
    \ establish distinctive,\n      independent routing policies through the graph\
    \ of Autonomous\n      Systems, and\n   o  Administrative domains would have a\
    \ degree of distrust of each\n      other that would mean that policies would\
    \ remain opaque.\n   These views were reflected by Susan Hares' (working for Merit\n\
    \   Networks at that time) contribution to the Internet Architecture\n   (INARC)\
    \ workshop in 1989, summarized in the report of the workshop\n   [INARC89]:\n\
    \      The rich interconnectivity within the Internet causes routing\n      problems\
    \ today.  However, the presenter believes the problem is\n      not the high degree\
    \ of interconnection, but the routing protocols\n      and models upon which these\
    \ protocols are based.  Rich\n      interconnectivity can provide redundancy which\
    \ can help packets\n      moving even through periods of outages.  Our model of\
    \ interdomain\n      routing needs to change.  The model of autonomous confederations\n\
    \      and autonomous systems [RFC0975] no longer fits the reality of\n      many\
    \ regional networks.  The ISO models of administrative domain\n      and routing\
    \ domains better fit the current Internet's routing\n      structure.\n      With\
    \ the first NSFNET backbone, NSF assumed that the Internet\n      would be used\
    \ as a production network for research traffic.  We\n      cannot stop these networks\
    \ for a month and install all new routing\n      protocols.  The Internet will\
    \ need to evolve its changes to\n      networking protocols while still continuing\
    \ to serve its users.\n      This reality colors how plans are made to change\
    \ routing\n      protocols.\n   It is also interesting to note that the difficulties\
    \ of organizing a\n   transition were recognized at this stage and have not been\
    \ seriously\n   explored or resolved since.\n   Policies would primarily be interested\
    \ in controlling which traffic\n   should be allowed to transit a domain (to satisfy\
    \ commercial\n   constraints or acceptable use policies), thereby controlling\
    \ which\n   traffic uses the resources of the domain.  The solution adopted by\n\
    \   both the IETF and OSI was a form of distance vector hop-by-hop\n   routing\
    \ with explicit policy terms.  The reasoning for this choice\n   can be found\
    \ in Breslau and Estrin's 1990 paper [Breslau90]\n   (implicitly -- because some\
    \ other alternatives are given such as a\n   link state with policy suggestion,\
    \ which, with hindsight, would have\n   even greater problems than BGP on a global\
    \ scale network).\n   Traditional distance-vector protocols exchanged routing\
    \ information\n   in the form of a destination and a metric.  The new protocols\n\
    \   explicitly associated policy expressions with the route by including\n   either\
    \ a list of the source ASs that are permitted to use the route\n   described in\
    \ the routing update, and/or a list of all ASs traversed\n   along the advertised\
    \ route.\n   Parallel protocol developments were already in progress by the time\n\
    \   this paper was published: BGP version 2 [RFC1163] in the IETF and the\n  \
    \ Inter-Domain Routing Protocol (IDRP) [ISO10747], which would be the\n   Level\
    \ 3 routing protocol for the OSI architecture.  IDRP was\n   developed under the\
    \ aegis of the ANSI XS3.3 working group led by\n   Lyman Chapin and Charles Kunzinger.\
    \  The two protocols were very\n   similar in basic design, but IDRP has some\
    \ extra features, some of\n   which have been incorporated into later versions\
    \ of BGP; others may\n   yet be so, and still others may be seen to be inappropriate.\
    \  Breslau\n   and Estrin summarize the design of IDRP as follows:\n      IDRP\
    \ attempts to solve the looping and convergence problems\n      inherent in distance\
    \ vector routing by including full AD\n      (Administrative Domain -- essentially\
    \ the equivalent of what are\n      now called ASs) path information in routing\
    \ updates.  Each routing\n      update includes the set of ADs that must be traversed\
    \ in order to\n      reach the specified destination.  In this way, routes that\
    \ contain\n      AD loops can be avoided.\n      IDRP updates also contain additional\
    \ information relevant to\n      policy constraints.  For instance, these updates\
    \ can specify what\n      other ADs are allowed to receive the information described\
    \ in the\n      update.  In this way, IDRP is able to express source specific\n\
    \      policies.  The IDRP protocol also provides the structure for the\n    \
    \  addition of other types of policy related information in routing\n      updates.\
    \  For example, User Class Identifiers (UCI) could also be\n      included as\
    \ policy attributes in routing updates.\n      Using the policy route attributes\
    \ IDRP provides the framework for\n      expressing more fine grained policy in\
    \ routing decisions.\n      However, because it uses hop-by-hop distance vector\
    \ routing, it\n      only allows a single route to each destination per-QOS to\
    \ be\n      advertised.  As the policy attributes associated with routes\n   \
    \   become more fine grained, advertised routes will be applicable to\n      fewer\
    \ sources.  This implies a need for multiple routes to be\n      advertised for\
    \ each destination in order to increase the\n      probability that sources have\
    \ acceptable routes available to them.\n      This effectively replicates the\
    \ routing table per forwarding\n      entity for each QoS, UCI, source combination\
    \ that might appear in\n      a packet.  Consequently, we claim that this approach\
    \ does not\n      scale well as policies become more fine grained, i.e., source\
    \ or\n      UCI specific policies.\n   Over the next three or four years, successive\
    \ versions of BGP (BGP-2\n   [RFC1163], BGP-3 [RFC1267], and BGP-4 [RFC1771])\
    \ were deployed to\n   cope with the growing and by now commercialized Internet.\
    \  From BGP-2\n   onwards, BGP made no assumptions about an overall structure\
    \ of\n   interconnections allowing it to cope with today's dense web of\n   interconnections\
    \ between ASs.  BGP version 4 was developed to handle\n   the change from classful\
    \ to classless addressing.  For most of this\n   time, IDRP was being developed\
    \ in parallel, and both protocols were\n   implemented in the Merit gatedaemon\
    \ routing protocol suite.  During\n   this time, there was a movement within the\
    \ IETF that saw BGP as a\n   stopgap measure to be used until the more sophisticated\
    \ IDRP could be\n   adapted to run over IP instead of the OSI connectionless protocol\n\
    \   Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP).  However, unlike its intra-\n   domain\
    \ counterpart IS-IS, which has stood the test of time, and\n   indeed proved to\
    \ be more flexible than OSPF, IDRP was ultimately not\n   adopted by the market.\
    \  By the time the NSFNET backbone was\n   decommissioned in 1995, BGP-4 was the\
    \ inter-domain routing protocol\n   of choice and OSI's star was already beginning\
    \ to wane.  IDRP is now\n   little remembered.\n   A more complete account of\
    \ the capabilities of IDRP can be found in\n   Chapter 14 of David Piscitello\
    \ and Lyman Chapin's book \"Open Systems\n   Networking: TCP/IP and OSI\", which\
    \ is now readable on the Internet\n   [Chapin94].\n   IDRP also contained quite\
    \ extensive means for securing routing\n   exchanges, much of it based on X.509\
    \ certificates for each router and\n   public-/private-key encryption of routing\
    \ updates.\n   Some of the capabilities of IDRP that might yet appear in a future\n\
    \   version of BGP include the ability to manage routes with explicit QoS\n  \

- title: 3.3.  Nimrod Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Nimrod Requirements\n   Nimrod as expressed by Noel Chiappa in his early\
    \ document, \"A New IP\n   Routing and Addressing Architecture\" [Chiappa91] and\
    \ later in the\n   NIMROD working group documents [RFC1753] and [RFC1992] established\
    \ a\n   number of requirements that need to be considered by any new routing\n\
    \   architecture.  The Nimrod requirements took RFC 1126 as a starting\n   point\
    \ and went further.\n   The three goals of Nimrod, quoted from [RFC1992], were\
    \ as follows:\n   1.  To support a dynamic internetwork of _arbitrary size_ (our\n\
    \       emphasis) by providing mechanisms to control the amount of\n       routing\
    \ information that must be known throughout an\n       internetwork.\n   2.  To\
    \ provide service-specific routing in the presence of multiple\n       constraints\
    \ imposed by service providers and users.\n   3.  To admit incremental deployment\
    \ throughout an internetwork.\n   It is certain that these goals should be considered\
    \ requirements for\n   any new domain-based routing architecture.\n   o  As discussed\
    \ in other sections of this document, the rate of\n      growth of the amount\
    \ of information needed to maintain the routing\n      system is such that the\
    \ system may not be able to scale up as the\n      Internet expands as foreseen.\
    \  And yet, as the services and\n      constraints upon those services grow, there\
    \ is a need for more\n      information to be maintained by the routing system.\
    \  One of the\n      key terms in the first requirements is \"control\".  While\n\
    \      increasing amounts of information need to be known and maintained\n   \
    \   in the Internet, the amounts and kinds of information that are\n      distributed\
    \ can be controlled.  This goal should be reflected in\n      the requirements\
    \ for the future domain-based architecture.\n   o  If anything, the demand for\
    \ specific services in the Internet has\n      grown since 1996 when the Nimrod\
    \ architecture was published.\n      Additionally, the kinds of constraints that\
    \ service providers need\n      to impose upon their networks and that services\
    \ need to impose\n      upon the routing have also increased.  Any changes made\
    \ to the\n      network in the last half-decade have not significantly improved\n\
    \      this situation.\n   o  The ability to incrementally deploy any new routing\
    \ architecture\n      within the Internet is still an absolute necessity.  It\
    \ is\n      impossible to imagine that a new routing architecture could\n    \
    \  supplant the current architecture on a flag day.\n   At one point in time,\
    \ Nimrod, with its addressing and routing\n   architectures, was seen as a candidate\
    \ for IPng.  History shows that\n   it was not accepted as the IPng, having been\
    \ ruled out of the\n   selection process by the IESG in 1994 on the grounds that\
    \ it was \"too\n   much of a research effort\" [RFC1752], although input for the\n\
    \   requirements of IPng was explicitly solicited from Chiappa [RFC1753].\n  \
    \ Instead, IPv6 has been put forth as the IPng.  Without entering a\n   discussion\
    \ of the relative merits of IPv6 versus Nimrod, it is\n   apparent that IPv6,\
    \ while it may solve many problems, does not solve\n   the critical routing problems\
    \ in the Internet today.  In fact, in\n   some sense, it exacerbates them by adding\
    \ a requirement for support\n   of two Internet protocols and their respective\
    \ addressing methods.\n   In many ways, the addition of IPv6 to the mix of methods\
    \ in today's\n   Internet only points to the fact that the goals, as set forth\
    \ by the\n   Nimrod team, remain as necessary goals.\n   There is another sense\
    \ in which the study of Nimrod and its\n   architecture may be important to deriving\
    \ a future domain-based\n   routing architecture.  Nimrod can be said to have\
    \ two derivatives:\n   o  Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS), in that it took\
    \ the notion\n      of forwarding along well-known paths.\n   o  Private Network-Node\
    \ Interface (PNNI), in that it took the notion\n      of abstracting topological\
    \ information and using that information\n      to create connections for traffic.\n\
    \   It is important to note, that whilst MPLS and PNNI borrowed ideas\n   from\
    \ Nimrod, neither of them can be said to be an implementation of\n   this architecture.\n"

    \ from the analysis of\n   BGP routing tables and routing registry databases:\n\
    \   o  The connectivity between provider ASs is becoming more like a\n      dense\
    \ mesh than the tree structure that was commonly assumed to be\n      commonplace\
    \ a couple of years ago.  This has been driven by the\n      increasing amounts\
    \ charged for peering and transit traffic by\n      global service providers.\
    \  Local direct peering and Internet\n      exchanges are becoming steadily more\
    \ common as the cost of local\n      fibre connections drops.\n   o  End-user\
    \ sites are increasingly resorting to multi-homing onto two\n      or more service\
    \ providers as a way of improving resiliency.  This\n      has a knock-on effect\
    \ of spectacularly fast depletion of the\n      available pool of AS numbers as\
    \ end-user sites require public AS\n      numbers to become multi-homed and corresponding\
    \ increase in the\n      number of prefixes advertised in BGP.\n   o  Multi-homed\
    \ sites are using advertisement of longer prefixes in\n      BGP as a means of\
    \ traffic engineering to load spread across their\n      multiple external connections\
    \ with further impact on the size of\n      the BGP tables.\n   o  Operational\
    \ practices are not uniform, and in some cases lack of\n      knowledge or training\
    \ is leading to instability and/or excessive\n      advertisement of routes by\
    \ incorrectly configured BGP speakers.\n   o  All these factors are quickly negating\
    \ the advantages in limiting\n      the expansion of BGP routing tables that were\
    \ gained by the\n      introduction of Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) and\n\

    \  for IPv6 to realize the worldview in which the default-free zone\n      would\
    \ be limited to perhaps 10,000 prefixes.\n   o  The typical \"width\" of the Internet\
    \ in AS hops is now around five,\n      and much less in many cases.\n   These\
    \ conclusions have a considerable impact on the requirements for\n   the future\
    \ domain-based routing architecture:\n   o  Topological hierarchy (e.g., mandating\
    \ a tree-structured\n      connectivity) cannot be relied upon to deliver scalability\
    \ of a\n      large Internet routing system.\n   o  Aggregation cannot be relied\

- title: 5.2.  Convergence and Recovery Issues
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Convergence and Recovery Issues\n   BGP today is a stable protocol under\
    \ most circumstances, but this has\n   been achieved at the expense of making\
    \ the convergence time of the\n   inter-domain routing system very slow under\
    \ some conditions.  This\n   has a detrimental effect on the recovery of the network\
    \ from\n   failures.\n   The timers that control the behavior of BGP are typically\
    \ set to\n   values in the region of several tens of seconds to a few minutes,\n\
    \   which constrains the responsiveness of BGP to failure conditions.\n   In the\
    \ early days of deployment of BGP, poor network stability and\n   router software\
    \ problems lead to storms of withdrawals closely\n   followed by re-advertisements\
    \ of many prefixes.  To control the load\n   on routing software imposed by these\
    \ \"route flaps\", route-flap\n   damping was introduced into BGP.  Most operators\
    \ have now implemented\n   a degree of route-flap damping in their deployments\
    \ of BGP.  This\n   restricts the number of times that the routing tables will\
    \ be\n   rebuilt, even if a route is going up and down very frequently.\n   Unfortunately,\
    \ route-flap damping responds to multiple flaps by\n   increasing the route suppression\
    \ time exponentially, which can result\n   in some parts of the Internet being\
    \ unreachable for hours at a time.\n   There is evidence ([RFC3221] and measurements\
    \ by some of the Sub-\n   Group B members [Jiang02]) that in today's network,\
    \ route flap is\n   disproportionately associated with the fine-grained prefixes\
    \ (length\n   22 or longer) associated with traffic engineering at the periphery\
    \ of\n   the network.  Auto-aggregation, as previously discussed, would tend\n\
    \   to mask such instability and prevent it being propagated across the\n   whole\
    \ network.  Another question that needs to be studied is the\n   continuing need\
    \ for an architecture that requires global convergence.\n   Some of our studies\
    \ (unpublished) show that, in some localities at\n   least, the network never\
    \ actually reaches stability; i.e., it never\n   really globally converges.  Can\
    \ a global, and beyond, network be\n   designed with the requirement of global\

  contents:
  - "5.4.  Multi-Homing Issues\n   As discussed previously, the increasing use of\
    \ multi-homing as a\n   robustness technique by peripheral networks requires that\
    \ multiple\n   routes have to be advertised for such domains.  These routes must\
    \ not\n   be aggregated close in to the multi-homed domain as this would defeat\n\
    \   the traffic engineering implied by multi-homing and currently cannot\n   be\
    \ aggregated further away from the multi-homed domain due to the\n   lack of auto-aggregation\
    \ capabilities.  Consequentially, the default-\n   free zone routing table is\
    \ growing exponentially, as it was before\n   CIDR.\n   The longest prefix match\
    \ routing technique introduced by CIDR, and\n   implemented in BGP-4, when combined\
    \ with provider address allocation\n   is an obstacle to effective multi-homing\
    \ if load sharing across the\n   multiple links is required.  If an AS has been\
    \ allocated, its\n   addresses from an upstream provider, the upstream provider\
    \ can\n   aggregate those addresses with those of other customers and need only\n\
    \   advertise a single prefix for a range of customers.  But, if the\n   customer\
    \ AS is also connected to another provider, the second\n   provider is not able\
    \ to aggregate the customer addresses because they\n   are not taken from his\
    \ allocation, and will therefore have to\n   announce a more specific route to\
    \ the customer AS.  The longest match\n   rule will then direct all traffic through\
    \ the second provider, which\n   is not as required.\n   Example:\n          \

    \           AS3\n                       Figure 1: Address Aggregation\n   In Figure\
    \ 1, AS3 has received its addresses from AS1, which means AS1\n   can aggregate.\
    \  But if AS3 wants its traffic to be seen equally both\n   ways, AS3 is forced\
    \ to announce both the aggregate and the more\n   specific route to AS2.\n   This\
    \ problem has induced many ASs to apply for their own address\n   allocation even\
    \ though they could have been allocated from an\n   upstream provider further\
    \ exacerbating the default-free zone route\n   table size explosion.  This problem\
    \ also interferes with the desire\n   of many providers in the default-free zone\
    \ to route only prefixes\n   that are equal to or shorter than 20 or 19 bits.\n\
    \   Note that some problems that are referred to as multi-homing issues\n   are\
    \ not, and should not be, solvable through the routing system\n   (e.g., where\
    \ a TCP load distributor is needed), and multi-homing is\n   not a panacea for\
    \ the general problem of robustness in a routing\n   system [Berkowitz01].\n \

    \ of the\n   difficulties of transition, deployment needs to start well in advance\n\
    \   of actual exhaustion so that the network as a whole is ready for the\n   new\
    \ capability when it is needed.  This implies that standardization\n   needs to\
    \ be complete and implementations available at least well in\n   advance of expected\
    \ exhaustion so that deployment of upgrades that\n   can handle the longer AS\
    \ numbers, should be starting around 2008, to\n   give a reasonable expectation\
    \ that the change has been rolled out\n   across a large fraction of the Internet\

- title: 5.9.  Interaction between Inter-Domain Routing and Intra-Domain Routing
  contents:
  - "5.9.  Interaction between Inter-Domain Routing and Intra-Domain Routing\n   Today,\
    \ many operators' backbone routers run both I-BGP and an intra-\n   domain protocol\
    \ to maintain the routes that reach between the borders\n   of the domain.  Exporting\
    \ routes from BGP into the intra-domain\n   protocol in use and bringing them\
    \ back up to BGP is not recommended\n   [RFC2791], but it is still necessary for\
    \ all backbone routers to run\n   both protocols.  BGP is used to find the egress\
    \ point and intra-\n   domain protocol to find the path (next-hop router) to the\
    \ egress\n   point across the domain.  This is not only a management problem but\n\
    \   may also create other problems:\n   o  BGP is a path-vector protocol (i.e.,\
    \ a protocol that uses distance\n      metrics possibly overridden by policy metrics),\
    \ whereas most\n      intra-domain protocols are link-state protocols.  As such,\
    \ BGP is\n      not optimized for convergence speed although distance-vector\n\
    \      algorithms generally require less processing power.  Incidentally,\n  \
    \    more efficient distance-vector algorithms are available such as\n      [Xu97].\n\
    \   o  The metrics used in BGP and the intra-domain protocol are rarely\n    \
    \  comparable or combinable.  Whilst there are arguments that the\n      optimizations\
    \ inside a domain may be different from those for end-\n      to-end paths, there\
    \ are occasions, such as calculating the\n      \"topologically nearest\" server\
    \ when computable or combinable\n      metrics would be of assistance.\n   o \
    \ The policies that can be implemented using BGP are designed for\n      control\
    \ of traffic exchange between operators, not for controlling\n      paths within\
    \ a domain.  Policies for BGP are most conveniently\n      expressed in Routing\
    \ Policy Support Language (RPSL) [RFC2622] and\n      this could be extended if\
    \ thought desirable to include additional\n      policy information.\n   o  If\
    \ the NEXT HOP destination for a set of BGP routes becomes\n      inaccessible\
    \ because of intra-domain protocol problems, the routes\n      using the vanished\
    \ next hop have to be invalidated at the next\n      available UPDATE.  Subsequently,\
    \ if the next-hop route reappears,\n      this would normally lead to the BGP\
    \ speaker requesting a full\n      table from its neighbor(s).  Current implementations\
    \ may attempt\n      to circumvent the effects of intra-domain protocol route\
    \ flap by\n      caching the invalid routes for a period in case the next hop\
    \ is\n      restored through the \"graceful restart\" mechanism.\n         Editors'\
    \ Note: This was standardized as [RFC4724].\n   o  Synchronization between intra-domain\
    \ and inter-domain routing\n      information is a problem as long as we use different\
    \ protocols for\n      intra-domain and inter-domain routing, which will most\
    \ probably be\n      the case even in the future because of the differing requirements\n\
    \      in the two situations.  Some sort of synchronization between those\n  \
    \    two protocols would be useful.  In the RFC \"IS-IS Transient\n      Blackhole\
    \ Avoidance\" [RFC3277], the intra-domain protocol side of\n      the story is\
    \ covered (there is an equivalent discussion for OSPF).\n   o  Synchronizing in\
    \ BGP means waiting for the intra-domain protocol\n      to know about the same\
    \ networks as the inter-domain protocol,\n      which can take a significant period\
    \ of time and slows down the\n      convergence of BGP by adding the intra-domain\
    \ protocol convergence\n      time into each cycle.  In general, operators no\
    \ longer attempt\n      full synchronization in order to avoid this problem (in\
    \ general,\n      redistributing the entire BGP routing feed into the local intra-\n\
    \      domain protocol is unnecessary and undesirable but where a domain\n   \
    \   has multiple exits to peers and other non-customer networks,\n      changes\
    \ in BGP routing that affect the exit taken by traffic\n      require corresponding\
    \ re-routing in the intra-domain routing).\n"
- title: 5.10.  Policy Issues
  contents:
  - "5.10.  Policy Issues\n   There are several classes of issues with current BGP\
    \ policy:\n   o  Policy is installed in an ad hoc manner in each autonomous system.\n\
    \      There isn't a method for ensuring that the policy installed in one\n  \
    \    router is coherent with policies installed in other routers.\n   o  As described\
    \ in Griffin [Griffin99] and in McPherson [RFC3345], it\n      is possible to\
    \ create policies for ASs, and instantiate them in\n      routers, that will cause\
    \ BGP to fail to converge in certain types\n      of topology\n   o  There is\
    \ no available network model for describing policy in a\n      coherent manner.\n\
    \   Policy management is extremely complex and mostly done without the\n   aid\
    \ of any automated procedures.  The extreme complexity means that a\n   highly-qualified\
    \ specialist is required for policy management of\n   border routers.  The training\
    \ of these specialists is quite lengthy\n   and needs to involve long periods\
    \ of hands-on experience.  There is,\n   therefore, a shortage of qualified staff\
    \ for installing and\n   maintaining the routing policies.  Because of the overall\
    \ complexity\n   of BGP, policy management tends to be only a relatively small\

    \ widely\n   deployed, it will do so without causing the disappearance of IPv4.\n\
    \   This means that unless something is done, service providers would\n   need\
