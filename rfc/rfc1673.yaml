- title: Executive Summary
  contents:
  - "Executive Summary\n   The question of the future of the Internet protocol (IP)\
    \ is an issue\n   of national if not international concern. It is critical to\
    \ the\n   building of a National Information Infrastructure, comparable to the\n\
    \   adoption of basic standards for the industrial era such as railways,\n   highways\
    \ and electricity.\n   The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) is a non-profit\n\
    \   organization, with 700 voluntary utility members, managing a\n   technical\
    \ research and development program for the electric utility\n   industry to improve\
    \ power production, distribution and use. The\n   electric power industry is a\
    \ major user of computing and\n   communications and is fully committed to open\
    \ systems.\n   While the industry is today a heavy user of the Internet Protocol\n\
    \   Suite (IPS) it is following a long term strategy based on\n   international\
    \ standards developed by ISO and CCITT and national\n   standards developed by\
    \ the IEEE, ANSI and other standards bodies that\n   employ formal review and\
    \ voting procedures.\n   This strategy is based on a survey of needs in all aspects\
    \ of the\n   electrical power supply enterprise.  It concluded that these needs\n\
    \   are met more effectively by the current suite of OSI protocols and\n   international\
    \ standards under development. Therefore, EPRI developed\n   the Utility Communications\
    \ Architecture (UCA) specification for\n   communications and the Database Access\
    \ Integrated Services\n   specification for data exchange both based on the OSI\
    \ model and\n   international standards.\n   These specifications have been incorporated\
    \ into the Industry\n   Government Open Systems Specification (IGOSS).  They are\
    \ receiving\n   favorable response and application by the industry and its suppliers\n\
    \   as well as the support of the natural gas and waterworks industries.\n   The\
    \ issues facing the Internet community concerning growth and the\n   address and\
    \ routing limitations of IP in particular, provide an ideal\n   opportunity for\
    \ creating the  national uniform information transport\n   superhighway. This\
    \ is critical to the NII Agenda and the only\n   proposal that will achieve this\
    \ goal is one that is acceptable from\n   both private and public sector viewpoints\
    \ with both a national and an\n   international perspective.\n   EPRI also believes\
    \ it is critically important that new requirements\n   need to be achieved by\
    \ convergence of efforts to develop additional\n   standards.  Security, directory\
    \ services, network management, and the\n   ability to support real-time applications\
    \ are four examples of where\n   new convergent standards efforts are required.\n\
    \   Just as society could not in the past accept multiple standards for\n   the\
    \ gauge of the nation's railways,  we can no longer accept multiple\n   standards\
    \ for information transport.\n"
- title: Engineering Considerations
  contents:
  - "Engineering Considerations\n   1. Mandatory Requirement.\n      Inter networking\
    \ must evolve to provide an industrial strength\n      computing and communications\
    \ environment for multiple uses of\n      globally connected network resources.\
    \  Specifically the underlying\n      transport must provide high integrity support\
    \ for upper layer\n      industrial OSI applications including but not limited\
    \ to MMS  and\n      TP. Use of interface layers such as RFC 1006 is not acceptable\n\
    \      except as a transition strategy.\n   2. Basic Requirements.\n      - Scaleability\n\
    \        The addressing scheme must have essentially an unlimited address\n  \
    \      space to encompass an arbitrarily large number of information\n       \
    \ objects.  Specifically it must solve the fundamental limitations\n        of\
    \ 32 bit formats, a format for 20 octets and above is considered\n        suitable.\n\
    \      - Routing table economy\n        Network addressing must achieve significant\
    \ economy in routing\n        database size with very large networks.\n      -\
    \ Support for the existing Internet\n        The existing internetworking paradigm\
    \ and existing OSI and IPS\n        applications are to be supported.\n   3. Key\
    \ Engineering Considerations - A pragmatic solution.\n      - Available now\n\
    \        The solution must be available now using mature, internationally\n  \
    \      agreed standards and off-the-shelf implementations for hosts and\n    \
    \    routers.  The solution must leverage existing investments in\n        standards\
    \ development, deployment and experience while at the\n        same time provide\
    \ for all basic requirements.\n      - Ease of Transition\n        Any solution\
    \ must provide an evolutionary transition path using\n        an OSI.\n      -\
    \ IP dual network layer strategy.\n        This must be achievable without modifications\
    \ to existing\n        inter-domain routing protocols while providing the ability\
    \ to\n        support proprietary protocols such as IPX and Appletalk.  The\n\
    \        scheme must provide the ability to encompass other addressing\n     \
    \   schemes such as X.121 and E.164.  Existing SNMP and CMIP MIBs\n        must\
    \ be applicable and available.  Internet domain names need\n        to be retained.\n\
    \      - Routing effectiveness\n        This key objective requires features such\
    \ as route aggregation,\n        service selection, and low frequency host advertisements;\
    \ host\n        routing intelligence should not be required.\n      - Flexible\
    \ Efficient Administration\n        Operational needs will need to be met in an\
    \ economic and\n        flexible manner.  Addressing allocations can be either\n\
    \        geographically based or based on carrier ID or both and will be\n   \
    \     administered by policy not network topology.  Simplified and\n        robust\
    \ configurability is required which includes the ability to\n        identify\
    \ resources e.g., multi-homed hosts and applications,\n        instead of interfaces.\n\
    \      - Mobility\n        Dynamic addressing is required where hosts have the\
    \ ability to\n        learn their own network address with the minimum of human\n\
    \        intervention.\n"
