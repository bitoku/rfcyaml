- title: INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR EACH SERVICE AVAILABLE TO THE NETWORK
  contents:
  - "INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR EACH SERVICE AVAILABLE TO THE NETWORK\n   There are\
    \ two classes of information which a site needs to provide\n   for each service\
    \ or process it makes available over the Network:\n      i) information required\
    \ by system programmers in order to\n      establish a connection to the facility\n\
    \      ii) information required by a user to gain access to and use the\n    \
    \  facility\n   The above two basic kinds of information which need to be in each\n\
    \   facility description will comprise a \"functional document\" (see RFC\n  \
    \ 115, NIC (5822,) for a description of functional documents and\n   recommended\
    \ procedures for updating them).\n   The information required by user site system\
    \ programmers may be a\n   detailed document or a reference to a document containing\
    \ a protocol\n   common to several facilities or some combination of the above.\
    \  All\n   information required such as connection socket numbers, message\n \
    \  formats, and character set information must be included.  Two\n   examples\
    \ of system programmer type information are RFC 74, NIC\n   (5417,) and RFC 105,\
    \ NIC (5775,) prepared by James White of UCSB.\n   The information required by\
    \ user site users is of three types:\n      a) information unique to Network users\
    \ of the facility\n      b) information in common between Network users and server\
    \ site\n      users of the facility\n      c) information unique to particular\
    \ Network user site.\n   The information of type c) would be prepared by the user\
    \ site from\n   the information provided by the server site.  An example might\
    \ be\n   keying conventions required in order to send certain codes to the\n \
    \  server site.\n   Future documentation will probably be written with information\
    \ types\n   a) and b) above integrated in one document, but initially server\n\
    \   sites will probably have user manuals or documentation for their\n   local\
    \ users and will need to write a short document giving any\n   additional information\
    \ required for Network users.  This information\n   will vary, but might include\
    \ a different login or control card\n   sequence, varying echo or syntax for user\
    \ sites operating with\n   character at a time, line at a time, server site or\
    \ user site echoing\n   and so forth.  Some features available to server site\
    \ users may not\n   be available to Network user site users or certain features\
    \ may\n   behave differently.\n   In addition to the above types of information,\
    \ there should be\n   instructions to the user on how to obtain help or answers\
    \ to\n   questions about using the facility.\n   Information about how to obtain\
    \ administrative access (charge\n   numbers, etc.) to a site should be contained\
    \ in the document, ARPA\n   Network Current Guides to Network Facilities, NIC\
    \ (5148,).  This\n   information is being collected by BBN.  This document will\
    \ in turn\n   contain references to the functional documents containing detailed\n\
    \   descriptions of available Network facilities and how to use them.\n   Even\
    \ if there are no special conventions or information unique to a\n   Network user\
    \ as opposed to a server site user, this fact should be\n   explicitly stated\
    \ in order to avoid confusion or uncertainty.\n"

  contents:
  - "NETWORK INFORMATION CENTER POLICY ON DISTRIBUTION AND UPDATING OF\n   DOCUMENTATION\n\
    \   The Network Information Center will distribute and maintain one copy\n   of\
    \ each functional document describing a facility in each Network\n   Station NIC\
    \ Collection.  For this purpose we would appreciate it if\n   100 copies of each\
    \ manual and set of manual updates, when they occur,\n   could be sent to the\
    \ NIC.  Users at sites desiring their own copies\n   of user documentation can\
    \ obtain them either directly from the server\n   site or by copying the master\
    \ in their local NIC Collection.  In\n   order that users may know where to obtain\
    \ additional copies of the\n   documentation, an address and a price, if any,\
    \ should be included in\n   the information about each facility.\n        [ This\
    \ RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n        [ into the online\
    \ RFC archives by Mirsad Todorovac 10/98 ]\n"
