  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a multipurpose internet mail extensions (MIME)\n\
    \   directory profile for holding a lightweight directory access protocol\n  \
    \ (LDAP) schema.  It is intended for communication with the Internet\n   schema\
    \ listing service.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"\
    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\

- title: 1. Overview
  contents:
  - "1. Overview\n   This document defines how a MIME type may be used to transfer\
    \ a\n   single LDAPv3 schema definition.\n   A schema for use with LDAPv3 consists\
    \ of any number of object class,\n   attribute type, matching rule and syntax\
    \ definitions.  These concepts\n   are defined in the LDAPv3 protocol definition\
    \ [2].  The schema MAY\n   have a numeric OID assigned to it by a schema listing\
    \ or registration\n   service.\n   A schema may import definitions from another\
    \ schema.  Schema imports\n   are not, however, transitive.\n   For example, a\
    \ schema contains a definition for a \"modem\" object\n   class, which is to be\
    \ defined as a subclass of the X.521 \"device\"\n   object class.  In this case,\
    \ the schema MUST import the definitions\n   of X.521.\n"
- title: 2. The "schema-ldap-0" MIME Directory Profile Registration
  contents:
  - "2. The \"schema-ldap-0\" MIME Directory Profile Registration\n   This profile\
    \ is identified by the following registration template\n   information.\n   To:\
    \ ietf-mime-direct@imc.org\n   Subject: Registration of text/directory MIME profile\
    \ \"schema-ldap-0\"\n   Profile name: schema-ldap-0\n   Profile purpose: To represent\
    \ a schema defined for use with LDAPv3\n   servers.\n   Profile types: SOURCE,\
    \ ldapSchemas, attributeTypes, matchingRules,\n   objectClasses, matchingRuleUse,\
    \ ldapSyntaxes\n   Profile special notes:\n   The charset parameter MUST be present\
    \ on the MIME content, and the\n   value of this parameter MUST be \"utf-8\".\
    \  This ensures that schema\n   values can be used in LDAPv3 attribute values\
    \ without a character set\n   translation.\n   Neither the \"BEGIN\" and \"END\"\
    \ types nor type grouping are used in\n   contents of this profile.\n   All of\
    \ the types in this profile with the exception of ldapSchemas\n   may be multi-valued.\
    \  Each value is present on its own contentline.\n   Values may be present in\
    \ any order, and need not be arranged by type.\n   The \"SOURCE\" type is optional,\
    \ and if values are present they SHOULD\n   be URIs of the \"ldap\" form.  If\
    \ the URI is of the \"ldap\" form, the\n   object indicated by the URI is a subschema\
    \ entry.  The use of other\n   forms are reserved for future applications.\n \
    \  In this version of the profile, exactly one value of the ldapSchemas\n   type\
    \ MUST be present.  (Later versions of the profile may permit\n   multiple ldapSchemas\
    \ values to be present in a content.)\n   Implementors should note that there\
    \ will likely be values of the\n   profile types in most contents much longer\
    \ than 76 bytes.  In\n   addition, there may be non-ASCII characters and embedded\
    \ CRLFs inside\n   of values, which could require either quoting of the value\
    \ or use of\n   a content transfer encoding.\n   If a contentline in a particular\
    \ content contains a \"context\"\n   parameter and the value of that parameter\
    \ is not \"ldap\", then that\n   contentline SHOULD be ignored.\n   Intended usage:\
    \ COMMON\n"
