  - "Abstract\n   A Segment Routing (SR) architecture leverages source routing and\n\
    \   tunneling paradigms and can be directly applied to the use of a\n   Multiprotocol\
    \ Label Switching (MPLS) data plane.  A node steers a\n   packet through a controlled\
    \ set of instructions called \"segments\" by\n   prepending the packet with an\
    \ SR header.\n   The segment assignment and forwarding semantic nature of SR raises\n\
    \   additional considerations for connectivity verification and fault\n   isolation\
    \ for a Label Switched Path (LSP) within an SR architecture.\n   This document\
    \ illustrates the problem and defines extensions to\n   perform LSP Ping and Traceroute\
    \ for Segment Routing IGP-Prefix and\n   IGP-Adjacency Segment Identifiers (SIDs)\
    \ with an MPLS data plane.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   \"Detecting Multiprotocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data-Plane\
    \ Failures\"\n   [RFC8029] defines a simple and efficient mechanism to detect\
    \ data-\n   plane failures in Label Switched Paths (LSPs) by specifying\n   information\
    \ to be carried in an MPLS \"echo request\" and \"echo reply\"\n   for the purposes\
    \ of fault detection and isolation.  Mechanisms for\n   reliably sending the echo\
    \ reply are defined.  The functionality\n   defined in [RFC8029] is modeled after\
    \ the Ping/Traceroute paradigm\n   (ICMP echo request [RFC792]) and is typically\
    \ referred to as \"LSP\n   Ping\" and \"LSP Traceroute\".  [RFC8029] supports\
    \ hierarchical and\n   stitching LSPs.\n   [SR] introduces and describes an SR\
    \ architecture that leverages the\n   source routing and tunneling paradigms.\
    \  A node steers a packet\n   through a controlled set of instructions called\
    \ \"segments\" by\n   prepending the packet with an SR header.  A detailed definition\
    \ of\n   the SR architecture is available in [SR].\n   As described in [SR] and\
    \ [SR-MPLS], the SR architecture can be\n   directly applied to an MPLS data plane,\
    \ the SID will be 20 bits, and\n   the SR header is the label stack.  Consequently,\
    \ the mechanics of\n   data-plane validation of [RFC8029] can be directly applied\
    \ to SR\n   MPLS.\n   Unlike LDP or RSVP, which are the other well-known MPLS\
    \ control plane\n   protocols, the basis of Segment ID assignment in SR architecture\
    \ is\n   not always on a hop-by-hop basis.  Depending on the type of Segment\n\
    \   ID, the assignment can be unique to the node or within a domain.\n   This\
    \ nature of SR raises additional considerations for validation of\n   fault detection\
    \ and isolation in an SR network.  This document\n   illustrates the problem and\
    \ describes a mechanism to perform LSP Ping\n   and Traceroute for Segment Routing\
    \ IGP-Prefix and IGP-Adjacency SIDs\n   within an MPLS data plane.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Coexistence of SR-Capable and Non-SR-Capable Node Scenarios\n   [INTEROP]\
    \ describes how SR operates in a network where SR-capable and\n   non-SR-capable\
    \ nodes coexist.  In such a network, one or more\n   SR-based LSPs and non-SR-based\
    \ LSPs are stitched together to achieve\n   an end-to-end LSP.  This is similar\
    \ to a network where LDP and RSVP\n   nodes coexist and the mechanism defined\
    \ in Section 4.5.2 of [RFC8029]\n   is applicable for LSP Ping and Trace.\n  \
    \ Section 8 of this document explains one of the potential gaps that is\n   specific\
    \ to SR-Capable and non-SR-capable node scenarios and explains\n   how the existing\
    \ mechanism defined in [RFC8029] handles it.\n"

  - "4.1.  Path Validation in Segment Routing Networks\n   [RFC8029] defines the MPLS\
    \ OAM mechanisms that help with fault\n   detection and isolation for an MPLS\
    \ data-plane path by the use of\n   various Target Forwarding Equivalence Class\
    \ (FEC) Stack sub-TLVs that\n   are carried in MPLS echo request packets and used\
    \ by the responder\n   for FEC validation.  While it is obvious that new sub-TLVs\
    \ need to be\n   assigned for SR, the unique nature of the SR architecture raises\
    \ the\n   need for additional operational considerations for path validation.\n\

    \      9124 --> Adjacency segment ID from R2 to R4.\n      9123 --> Adjacency\
    \ Segment ID from R2 to R3.\n   The forwarding semantic of the Adjacency Segment\
    \ ID is to pop the\n   Segment ID and send the packet to a specific neighbor over\
    \ a specific\n   link.  A malfunctioning node may forward packets using the Adjacency\n\
    \   Segment ID to an incorrect neighbor or over an incorrect link.  The\n   exposed\
    \ Segment ID (of an incorrectly forwarded Adjacency Segment ID)\n   might still\
    \ allow such a packet to reach the intended destination,\n   even though the intended\
    \ strict traversal was broken.\n   In the topology above, assume that R1 sends\
    \ traffic with a segment\n   stack as {9124, 5008} so that the path taken will\
    \ be\n   R1-R2-R4-R5-R7-R8.  If the Adjacency Segment ID 9124 is misprogrammed\n\
    \   in R2 to send the packet to R1 or R3, the packet may still be\n   delivered\
    \ to R8 (if the nodes are configured with the same SR Global\n   Block (SRGB))\
    \ [SR] but not via the expected path.\n   MPLS traceroute may help with detecting\
    \ such a deviation in the\n   above-mentioned scenario.  However, in a different\
    \ example, it may\n   not be helpful, for example, if R3 forwards a packet with\
    \ Adjacency\n   Segment ID 9236 via link L1 (due to misprogramming) when it was\n\
    \   expected to be forwarded over link L2.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.1.  FECs in Target FEC Stack TLV\n   When LSP echo request packets are generated\
    \ by an initiator, FECs\n   carried in the Target FEC Stack TLV may need to differ\
    \ to support an\n   SR architecture.  The following defines the Target FEC Stack\
    \ TLV\n   construction mechanics by an initiator for SR scenarios.\n      Ping\n\
    \         The initiator MUST include FEC(s) corresponding to the\n         destination\
    \ segment.\n         The initiator MAY include FECs corresponding to some or all\
    \ of\n         the segments imposed in the label stack by the initiator to\n \
    \        communicate the segments traversed.\n      Traceroute\n         The initiator\

    \ Change TLV\n         with one or more of the original segments being popped,\

    \         Stack TLV in the next (TTL+1) traceroute request, as defined in\n  \
    \       Section 4.6 of [RFC8029].\n         When a received echo reply does not\
    \ contain the FEC Stack\n         Change TLV, the initiator MUST NOT attempt to\
    \ remove any FECs\n         from the Target FEC Stack TLV in the next (TTL+1)\
    \ traceroute\n         request.\n   As defined in [SR-OSPF] and [SR-IS-IS], the\
    \ Prefix SID can be\n   advertised as an absolute value, an index, or as a range.\
    \  In any of\n   these cases, the initiator MUST derive the Prefix mapped to the\n\
    \   Prefix SID and use it in the IGP-Prefix Segment ID defined in\n   Sections\
    \ 5.1 and 5.2.  How the responder uses the details in the\n   SR-FEC sub-TLV to\

- title: 7.5.  TTL Consideration for Traceroute
  contents:
  - "7.5.  TTL Consideration for Traceroute\n   The LSP Traceroute operation can properly\
    \ traverse every hop of the\n   SR network for the Uniform Model as described\
    \ in [RFC3443].  If one\n   or more LSRs employ a Short Pipe Model, as described\
    \ in [RFC3443],\n   then the LSP Traceroute may not be able to properly traverse\
    \ every\n   hop of the SR network due to the absence of TTL copy operation when\n\
    \   the outer label is popped.  The Short Pipe is one of the most\n   commonly\
    \ used models.  The following TTL manipulation technique MAY\n   be used when\
    \ the Short Pipe Model is used.\n   When tracing an LSP according to the procedures\
    \ in [RFC8029], the TTL\n   is incremented by one in order to trace the path sequentially\
    \ along\n   the LSP.  However, when a source-routed LSP has to be traced, there\n\
    \   are as many TTLs as there are labels in the stack.  The LSR that\n   initiates\
    \ the traceroute SHOULD start by setting the TTL to 1 for the\n   tunnel in the\
    \ LSP's label stack it wants to start the tracing from,\n   the TTL of all outer\
    \ labels in the stack to the max value, and the\n   TTL of all the inner labels\
    \ in the stack to zero.  Thus, a typical\n   start to the traceroute would have\
    \ a TTL of 1 for the outermost label\n   and all the inner labels would have a\
    \ TTL of 0.  If the FEC Stack TLV\n   is included, it should contain only those\
    \ for the inner-stacked\n   tunnels.  The Return Code/Subcode and FEC Stack Change\
    \ TLV should be\n   used to diagnose the tunnel as described in [RFC8029].  When\
    \ the\n   tracing of a tunnel in the stack is complete, then the next tunnel in\n\
    \   the stack should be traced.  The end of a tunnel can be detected from\n  \
    \ the Return Code when it indicates that the responding LSR is an\n   egress for\
    \ the stack at depth 1.  Thus, the traceroute procedures in\n   [RFC8029] can\
    \ be recursively applied to traceroute a source-routed\n   LSP.\n"
- title: 8.  Backward Compatibility with Non-SR Devices
  contents:
  - "8.  Backward Compatibility with Non-SR Devices\n   [INTEROP] describes how SR\
    \ operates in a network where SR-capable and\n   non-SR-capable nodes coexist.\
    \  In such networks, there may not be any\n   FEC mapping in the responder when\
    \ the initiator is SR-capable, while\n   the responder is not (or vice-versa).\
    \  But this is not different from\n   RSVP and LDP interoperation scenarios. \
    \ When LSP Ping is triggered,\n   the responder will set the FEC-return-code to\
    \ Return 4, \"Replying\n   router has no mapping for the FEC at stack-depth\"\
    .\n   Similarly, when an SR-capable node assigns Adj-SID for a non-SR-\n   capable\
    \ node, the LSP traceroute may fail as the non-SR-capable node\n   is not aware\
    \ of the \"IGP Adjacency Segment ID\" sub-TLV and may not\n   reply with the FEC\
    \ Stack Change sub-TLVs.  This may result in any\n   further downstream nodes\
    \ replying back with a Return Code of 4,\n   \"Replying router has no mapping\
    \ for the FEC at stack-depth\".\n"
