  - "                         Network Questionnaires\n    In recent times, a steady\
    \ stream of questionnaires has been arriving\nfrom the network community. Each\
    \ questionnaire creates an additional\ndistraction from more useful work and raises\
    \ the general annoyance level\nsomewhat. The arrival of the seven-page NCP questionnaire\
    \ (RFC 460) has\npushed the annoyance level over the top.\n    We are wondering\
    \ if any of the questionnaire polluters has given any\nthought to the fact that\
    \ it takes time to fill out these questionnaires\nespecially if one wants to do\
    \ a conscientious job and provide reasonable\nanswers to questions which are frequently\
    \ only partially applicable.\n    It seems rather presumptuous for RFC 460 to\
    \ provide a lengthy\nquestionnaire without any explanation as to the motivation\
    \ for it and\nthen request a response in two weeks. And tantalize us yet with\
    \ the\npromise of additional questionnaires in the future.\n    Sites which have\
    \ the luxury of people who have nothing better to do\nthan create questionnaires\
    \ and other meta-work should realize that there\nare some sites that operate with\
    \ limited personnel resources, do have\nsomething better to do, and will get nothing\
    \ done if they are\ncontinually swamped with all kinds of meta-work.\n  This material\
    \ has not been reviewed for public release and is intended\n  only for use with\
    \ the ARPA network. It should not be quoted or cited\n  in any publication not\
    \ related to the ARPA network.\n        [ This RFC was put into machine readable\
    \ form for entry ]\n        [ into the online RFC archives by Alex McKenzie with\
    \    ]\n        [ support from GTE, formerly BBN Corp.             9/99 ]\n"
