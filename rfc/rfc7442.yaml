  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC6826] describes how to map Point-to-Multipoint Label
    Switched\n   Paths (P2MP LSPs) created by mLDP [RFC6388] to multicast trees\n
    \  created by Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) in\n   Source-Specific
    Multicast (SSM) mode [RFC4607].  This document\n   describes how to map mLDP P2MP
    trees to multicast trees created by\n   PIM-SM in Any-Source Multicast (ASM) mode.
    \ It describes two possible\n   mechanisms for doing this.\n   The first mechanism,
    described in Section 2, is OPTIONAL for\n   implementations, but the second mechanism,
    described in Section 3, is\n   REQUIRED for all implementations claiming conformance
    to this\n   specification.\n   Note that from a deployment point of view these
    two mechanisms are\n   mutually exclusive.  That is, on the same network one could
    deploy\n   either one of the mechanisms, but not both.\n   The reader of this
    document is expected to be familiar with PIM-SM\n   [RFC4601] and mLDP [RFC6388].\n
    \  This document relies on the procedures in [RFC6826] to support source\n   trees.
    \ For example, following these procedures a Label Switching\n   Router (LSR) may
    initiate an mLDP Label Map with the Transit\n   IPv4/IPv6 Source TLV for (S,G)
    when receiving a PIM (S,G) Join.\n   This document uses BGP Source Active auto-discovery
    routes, as\n   defined in [RFC6514].  For the sake of brevity in the rest of this\n
    \  document, we'll refer to these routes as just \"Source Active\n   auto-discovery
    routes\".\n   Consider a deployment scenario where the service provider has\n
    \  provisioned the network in such a way that the Rendezvous Point (RP)\n   for
    a particular ASM group G is always between the receivers and the\n   sources.
    \ If the network is provisioned in this manner, the ingress\n   Provider Edge
    (PE) for (S,G) is always the same as the ingress PE for\n   the RP, and thus the
    Source Active auto-discovery (A-D) routes are\n   never needed.  If it is known
    a priori that the network is\n   provisioned in this manner, mLDP in-band signaling
    can be supported\n   using a different set of procedures, as specified in [RFC7438].
    \ A\n   service provider will provision the PE routers to use either the\n   procedures
    in [RFC7438] or those described in this document.\n   Like [RFC6826], each IP
    multicast tree is mapped one-to-one to a P2MP\n   LSP in the MPLS network.  This
    type of service works well if the\n   number of LSPs that are created is under
    the control of the MPLS\n   network operator, or if the number of LSPs for a particular
    service\n   is known to be limited.\n   It is to be noted that the existing BGP
    Multicast VPN (MVPN)\n   procedures [RFC6514] can be used to map Internet IP multicast
    trees\n   to P2MP LSPs.  These procedures would accomplish this for IP\n   multicast
    trees created by PIM-SM in SSM mode, as well as for IP\n   multicast trees created
    by PIM-SM in ASM mode.  Furthermore, these\n   procedures would also support the
    ability to aggregate multiple IP\n   multicast trees to one P2MP LSP in the MPLS
    network.  The details of\n   this particular approach are out of scope for this
    document.\n   This document assumes that a given LSR may have some interfaces
    that\n   are IP multicast capable, while other interfaces would be MPLS\n   capable.\n"
