3rd Level Ideas and other Noises
On 12 August 70, I met a BBN with representatives from BBN and MIT and we discussed third llevel protocol.
Dial up The following proposed dial up protocol was agreed upon at the meeting.
The purpose of this piece of protocol is to get a process at one site (hereafter the using site) in contact with the logger at the other site (hereafter the serving site).
To initiate contact, the using process attaches a receive socket US and requests connection to socket 1 in the serving host.
The serving Host may decide to refuse contact, in which case it will respond with the standard CLS.
If it accepts contact, however, it will send exactly an even 32 bit number over the connection and close the connection.
This even 32 bit number is the name of a receive socket in the serving Host.
p. Note that SS must be even.
At this point the user should be connected to the logger at the serving site.
We next agreed on an initial network standard console: 7 bit ASCII in 8 bit fields with the eight bit on, transmitted in contiguous streams.
The speific codes are listed in appendix H of the IMP Operations manual, BBN report #1877.
This seems to work only some hardship on PDP 10's and be fine for all others.
