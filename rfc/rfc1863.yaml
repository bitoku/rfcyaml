    \   The intention of the proposed technique is to reduce overhead and\n   management\

    \ might be required or desired among routers\n   within a single routing domain\

  - "1. Overview\n   Current deployments of Exterior Routing protocols, such as the\
    \ Border\n   Gateway Protocol [BGP4] and the adaptation of the ISO Inter-Domain\n\
    \   Routing Protocol [IDRP], require that all BGP/IDRP routers, which\n   participate\
    \ in inter-domain routing (border routers) and belong to\n   the same routing\
    \ domain, establish a full mesh connectivity with each\n   other for purpose of\
    \ exchanging routing information acquired from\n   other routing domains. In large\
    \ routing domains the number of intra-\n   domain connections that needs to be\
    \ maintained by each border route\n   can be significant.\n   In addition, it\
    \ may be desired for a border router to establish\n   routing sessions with all\
    \ border routers in other domains which are\n   reachable via a shared communication\
    \ media. We refer to routers that\n   are directly reachable via a shared media\
    \ as adjacent routers.  Such\n   direct peering allows a router to acquire \"\
    first hand\" information\n   about destinations which are directly reachable through\
    \ adjacent\n   routers and select the optimum direct paths to these destinations.\n\
    \   Establishment of BGP/IDRP sessions among all adjacent border routers\n   would\
    \ result in a full mesh routing connectivity.  Unfortunately for\n   a switched\
    \ media as ATM, SMDS or Frame Relay network which may\n   inter-connect a large\
    \ number of routers,  due to the number of\n   connections that would be needed\
    \ to maintain a full mesh direct\n   peering between the routers,  makes this\
    \ approach impractical.\n   In order to alleviate the \"full mesh\" problem, this\
    \ paper proposes to\n   use IDRP/BGP Route Servers which would relay external\
    \ routes with all\n   of their attributes between client routers. The clients\
    \ would\n   maintain IDRP/BGP sessions only with the assigned route servers\n\
    \   (sessions with more than one server would be needed if redundancy is\n   desired).\
    \  All routes that are received from a client router would be\n   propagated to\
    \ other clients by the Route Server.  Since all external\n   routes and their\
    \ attributes are relayed unmodified between the client\n   routers, the client\
    \ routers would acquire the same routing\n   information as they would via direct\
    \ peering.  We refer to such\n   arrangement as virtual peering.  Virtual peering\
    \ allows client\n   routers independently apply selection criteria to the acquired\n\
    \   external routes according to their local policies as they would if a\n   direct\
    \ peering were established.\n   The routing approach described in this paper assumes\
    \ that border\n   routers possess a mechanism to resolve the media access address\
    \ of\n   the next hop router for any route acquired from a virtual peer.\n   It\
    \ is fair to note that the approach presented in this paper only\n   reduces the\
    \ number of routing connection each border router needs to\n   maintain. It does\
    \ not reduce the volume of routing information that\n   needs to maintained at\
    \ each border router.\n   Besides addressing the \"full mesh\" problems,  the\
    \ proposal attempts\n   to achieve the following goals:\n   - to minimize BGP/IDRP\
    \ changes that need to be implemented in client\n     routers in order to inter-operate\
    \ with route servers;\n   - to provide for redundancy of distribution of routing\
    \ information to\n     route server clients;\n   - to minimize the amount of routing\
    \ updates that have to be sent to\n     route server clients;\n   - to provide\
    \ load distribution between route servers;\n   - to avoid an excessive complexity\
    \ of the interactions between Route\n     Servers themselves.\n"

  - "2. Terms And Acronyms\n   The following terms and acronyms are used in this paper:\n\
    \  Routing Domain     -  a collection of routers with the same set of\n      \
    \                  routing policies.  For IPv4 it can be identified\n        \
    \                with an Autonomous System Number, for IPv6\n                \
    \        it can be identified with a Routing Domain\n                        Identifier.\n\
    \  Border Router (BR) -  a router that acquires external routes, i.e.\n      \
    \                  routes to internet points outside its routing\n           \
    \             domain.\n  Route Server (RS)  -  a process that collects routing\
    \ information\n                        from border routers and distributes this\n\
    \                        information to 'client routers'.\n  RS Client (RC)  \
    \   -  a router than peers with an RS in order to\n                        acquire\
    \ routing information.  A server's client\n                        can be a router\
    \ or another route server.\n  RS Cluster (RSC)   -  two or more of route servers\
    \ that share the same\n                        subset of clients.  A RS Cluster\
    \ provides\n                        redundancy of routing information to its\n\

- title: 3. RS Model
  contents:
  - "3. RS Model\n   In the proposed scheme a Route Server (RS) does not apply any\n\
    \   selection criteria to the routes received from border routers for the\n  \
    \ purpose of distributing these routes to its clients.  All routes\n   acquired\
    \ from border routers or other Route Servers are relayed to\n   the client border\
    \ routers.\n   There can be two classes of Route Servers: Route Servers that relay\n\
    \   external routes between routers in a single routing domain and Route\n   Servers\
    \ that relay external routes between border routers in\n   different routing domains.\
    \  The former are Intra-Domain Route Servers\n   and the latter are Inter-Domain\
    \ Route Servers.\n   In the RS model proposed in this document there is no routing\n\
    \   exchange between Intra-Domain Route Servers and Inter-Domain Route\n   Servers.\
    \  Routes that cross a domain boundary must always pass\n   through a border router\
    \ of such a domain which may apply\n   administrative filters to such routes.\n\
    \   Operations of Intra-Domain Route Servers and Inter-Domain Route\n   Servers\
    \ are identical.\n   One or more Route Servers form an RS Cluster (RSC).  For\
    \ redundancy's\n   sake two or more RSs can be configured to operate in an RS\
    \ Cluster.\n   All route servers in an RSC share the same clients,  i.e. cluster\n\
    \   clients establish connections to all route servers in such an RSC for\n  \
    \ the purpose of exchanging routing information. Each cluster is\n   assigned\
    \ an unique RSC Identifier (RCID) represented by a 2-octet\n   unsigned integer.\n\
    \   Clusters which provide virtual connectivity between their clients\n   would\
    \ be normally exchanging routing information among themselves so\n   that all\
    \ external routes are propagated to all participating clients.\n   Though a Route\
    \ Server Client (RC) can be associated with multiple\n   RSC, it seems that there\
    \ is no real advantage of doing so except for\n   a short transition period to\
    \ provide a graceful re-assignment from\n   one RSC to another or, if for some\
    \ reason, there are multiple RS\n   groups that don't exchange routing information\
    \ with each other.\n   The inter-cluster route exchange can be accomplished by\
    \ forming a\n   full mesh routing adjacency between clusters.  In this approach,\n\
    \   illustrated in the diagram below,  each RS in each RSC would maintain\n  \
    \ a routing connection with every RS in other RS clusters.  Only routes\n   that\
    \ are acquired from border routers are propagated to RSs in other\n   RS clusters.\n\

    \         !  RS11  RS12   ! --- !  RS21    RS22  !\n          -----------------\

    \                         \\         /\n                       -----------------\n\
    \                       !  RS31  RS32   !   <RSC#3>\n                       -----------------\n\

    \   Another way to propagate routing information between clusters would\n   be\
    \ to form a cluster hierarchy in which an RS in one cluster\n   maintains sessions\
    \ only with RSs in designated clusters.  In this\n   approach an RS must advertise\
    \ all acquired routes to an RS in another\n   cluster except the routes that are\
    \ acquired from that cluster.\n   Nevertheless,  it allows for minimizing the\
    \ number of routing\n   sessions which can be highly desirable in some network.\
    \  It is\n   important for the hierarchical scheme that the inter-cluster route\n\
    \   exchange links form a tree, i.e. there is only one route propagation\n   path\
    \ between any two clusters, otherwise routing loops may result.\n   For detection\
    \ and pruning of routing loops in a hierarchical cluster\n   topology, it is advisable\
    \ to include the \"RCID Path\" attribute (see\n   4.3.4) in all routing updates\
    \ sent between route servers. This\n   attribute lists IDs of all clusters in\
    \ the route propagation path.\n   When a duplicate ID is detected in this attribute\
    \ an offending route\n   needs to be discarded.\n   The diagram below which illustrates\
    \ the hierarchical approach is\n   created from the diagram above by removing\
    \ the route exchange link\n   between clusters 2 and 3.\n         BR11   BR12\
    \   BR1n     BR21  BR22  BR2n\n           |     |  ... |        |     | ...  |\n\
    \          -----------------     ------------------\n          !  RS11  RS12 \
    \  ! --- !  RS21    RS22  !\n          -----------------     ------------------\n\
    \               <RSC#1>  \\                <RSC#2>\n                         \\\
    \n                       -----------------\n                       !  RS31  RS32\
    \   !   <RSC#3>\n                       -----------------\n                  \
    \       |     | ... |\n                        BR31  BR32  BR3n\n   It seems that\
    \ the only disadvantage of the hierarchical model, is the\n   management headache\
    \ of avoiding routing loops and redundant\n   information flow by insuring that\
    \ inter-cluster links always form a\n   tree.  But more study is needed to fully\
    \ evaluate the comparative\n   merits of the full-mesh and hierarchical models.\n\
    \   Since RSs in the same cluster maintain routing sessions with the same\n  \
    \ set of clients, it may seem that there is no need to exchange routing\n   information\
    \ between RSs in the same cluster. Nevertheless, such a\n   route exchange may\
    \ help to maintain identical routing databases in\n   the servers during client\
    \ acquisition periods and when a partial\n   failure may affect some routing sessions.\n\
    \   Route servers in the same RS cluster exchange control messages in\n   attempt\
    \ to subdivide the responsibilities of providing routing\n   information to their\
    \ clients.  In order to simplify the RS design,\n   the RS messaging is implemented\
    \ on top of exterior protocol which is\n   used by route servers for the routing\
    \ information exchange.\n"

    \ in UPDATE messages from route servers are processed\n   as if they were received\
    \ directly from the border routers specified\n   in the ADVERTISER attributes\

    \ external routes from RS clients that are also\n   border routers.  A RS also\
    \ may acquire external routes from other\n   RSs.  Route servers relay all acquired\
    \ routes unaltered to their\n   clients.  No route selection is performed for\
    \ purpose of route re-\n   advertisement to RS clients.\n   While route servers\
    \ receive and store routing data from all their\n   client,  Routing Servers in\
    \ the same cluster coordinate their route\n   advertisement in the attempt to\
    \ ensure that only one RS provides\n   routing updates to a given client.  If\
    \ an RS fails,  other Route\n   Servers in the cluster take over the responsibility\
    \ of providing\n   routing updates to the clients that were previously served\
    \ by the\n   failed RS.  A route flap that can result from such switch-over can\
    \ be\n   eliminated by the configuring client's \"Hold Time\" of their BGP-\n\
    \   4/IDRP sessions with the route servers to be larger than the switch-\n   over\
    \ time.  The switch-over time is determined by the Hold Time of\n   BGP-4/IDRP\
    \ sessions between the route servers in the cluster and the\n   period that is\
    \ needed for that route servers to reconcile their route\n   advertisement responsibilities.\
    \  The reconciliation protocol is\n   described in 4.3.3.\n   The BGP-4/IDRP operations\
    \ of route servers differs from the\n   \"standard\" operation in the following\
    \ ways:\n   -    when receiving routes from another RS, the RS Client mode of\n\
    \        operation is assumed, i.e., when a route with completely\n        identical\
    \ attributes has been previously acquired from an RS\n        belonging to the\
    \ same cluster as the RS that advertises the new\n        route, the previously\
    \ acquired route should be discarded and\n        the newly acquired route should\
    \ be accepted.  Such a route\n        replacement should not trigger any route\
    \ advertisement action\n        on behalf of the route.\n   -    all acquired\
    \ routes are advertised to a client router except\n        routes which were acquired\
    \ from that client (no route echoing);\n   -    if the hierarchical model of inter-cluster\
    \ route exchange is\n        used,  all acquired routes are advertised to an RS\
    \ in another\n        RSC except routes that are acquired from that RSC.  In the\n\
    \        full-mesh model, only routes which are acquired from border\n       \
    \ routers are advertised to route servers in other clusters;\n   -    if route\
    \ servers in the same RS cluster are configured to\n        exchange routing information,\
    \  only external routes that are\n        acquired from border routers are advertised\
    \ to route servers in\n        the local cluster;\n   -    the ADVERTISER path\
    \ attribute is included in every UPDATE\n        messages that is generated by\
    \ RS.  This attribute must\n        specify the identifying address of the border\
    \ router from which\n        information provided in UPDATE has been acquired.\
    \  All other\n        routing attributes should be relayed to RS's peers unaltered.\n\
    \   -    when a route advertised by to an RS by a client becomes\n        unreachable\

    \ activities,  route servers\n   which are members of the same RS cluster establish\
    \ and maintain\n   BGP/IDRP connections between themselves forming a full-mesh\n\
    \   connectivity.  Normally, there is no need for more than two-three\n   route\
    \ servers in one cluster.\n   Route servers belonging to the same cluster send\
    \ to each other LIST\n   messages with lists of clients to which they're providing\
    \ routing\n   information;  let's call such clients \"informed clients\".\n  \
    \ Each RS maintains a separate \"informed client\" list for each RS in\n   the\
    \ local cluster including itself.  All such lists are linked in an\n   ascending\
    \ order that is determined by the number of clients in each\n   list; the order\
    \ among the lists with the same number of clients is\n   determined by comparing\
    \ the identifying addresses of the\n   corresponding RSs -- an RS in such a \"\
    same number of clients\" subset\n   is positioned after all RSs with the lower\

- title: 4.3.3.3 New Client Processing
  contents:
  - "4.3.3.3 New Client Processing\n   Whenever an RS acquires a new BGP/IDRP peer\
    \ it scans through all\n   \"informed client\" lists in order to determine if\
    \ this peer has\n   already been receiving routing updates from another RS in\
    \ the local\n   RS cluster.  If the identifying address of the peer is found in\
    \ one\n   of the list,  no routing updates are sent to that peer.\n   If the peer's\
    \ Router Id is not found,  the route server initiates a\n   'DelayTimer' timer\
    \ for that peer and the decision is postponed until\n   that timer expires.  The\
    \ delay value is calculated as followed:\n      the RS determines the relative\
    \ position of its own \"informed\n      client\" list in the linked list of all\
    \ \"informed client\" lists.\n      If such position is expressed with a number,\
    \ say N,  in the 1 to\n      \"maximum number of lists\" range, then the delay\
    \ value is set to\n      (N-1)*<DelayGranularity>.\n   Upon expiration of the\
    \ DelayTimer,  the \"informed client\" lists are\n   scanned once again to see\
    \ if the corresponding peer has already been\n   receiving routing updates from\
    \ another RS in the local RS cluster.\n   If the Router Id of the peer is found\
    \ in one of the lists as a result\n   of receiving a new LIST message, no routing\
    \ updates are sent to that\n   peer.  Otherwise,  the peer's Router ID is entered\
    \ in the \"informed\n   client\" list that belongs to the RS,  the transmission\
    \ of the updated\n   LIST message is immediately scheduled, and routing updates\
    \ are sent\n   to the client.\n   The rational for the delay is to minimize races\
    \ in the decision as\n   which RS among route servers in the same RSC is going\
    \ to provide\n   routing information to a given client.  The RS with least number\
    \ of\n   \"informed clients\" would have a shortest delay and is the most\n  \
    \ probable to win the race.  This helps to equalize the number of\n   \"informed\
    \ clients\" between RSc in a cluster.\n   After an BGP/IDRP peer is placed in\
    \ the \"informed client\" list, it is\n   only removed from the list when the\
    \ BGP/IDRP connection to this peer\n   is lost.  While an RS client is in the\
    \ list it is accurately updated\n   with all routing changes.\n"
