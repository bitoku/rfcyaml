  - "1. Introduction\n   This memo specifies how SOAP 1.1 envelopes[1] are transmitted\
    \ using a\n   BEEP profile[2].  In the W3C, the XMLP effort is evolving SOAP.\n\
    \   Accordingly, this memo provides a mechanism for negotiating the use\n   of\
    \ new features.\n   Throughout this memo, the term \"envelope\" refers to the\
    \ \"SOAP-\n   Env:Envelope\" element defined in Section 4 of [1].  Further, the\n\
    \   terms \"peer\", \"client\", \"server\", \"one-to-one\", and \"one-to-many\"\
    \ are\n   used in the context of BEEP.  In particular, Sections 2.1 and 2.1.1\n\
    \   of [2] discuss BEEP roles and exchange styles.\n"
- title: 2. BEEP Profile Identification
  contents:
  - "2. BEEP Profile Identification\n   The BEEP profile for SOAP is identified as\n\
    \       http://iana.org/beep/soap\n   in the BEEP \"profile\" element during channel\
    \ creation.\n   In BEEP, when the first channel is successfully created, the\n\
    \   \"serverName\" attribute in the \"start\" element identifies the \"virtual\n\
    \   host\" associated with the peer acting in the server role, e.g.,\n       <start\
    \ number='1' serverName='stockquoteserver.example.com'>\n           <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/soap'\
    \ />\n       </start>\n   The \"serverName\" attribute is analagous to HTTP's\
    \ \"Host\" request-\n   header field (c.f., Section 14.23 of [3]).\n   There are\
    \ two states in the BEEP profile for SOAP, \"boot\" and\n   \"ready\":\n   o \
    \ In the \"boot\" state, the peer requesting the creation of the\n      channel\
    \ sends a \"bootmsg\" (either during channel initialization or\n      in a \"\
    MSG\" message).\n      *  If the other peer sends a \"bootrpy\" (either during\
    \ channel\n         initialization or in a \"RPY\" message), then the \"ready\"\
    \ state\n         is entered\n      *  Otherwise, the other peer sends an \"error\"\
    \ (either during\n         channel initialization or in a \"ERR\" message), then\
    \ no state\n         change occurs.\n   o  In the \"ready\" state, either peer\
    \ begins a SOAP message pattern by\n      sending a \"MSG\" message containing\
    \ an envelope.  The other peer\n      completes the message pattern either by:\n\
    \      *  sending back a \"RPY\" message containing an envelope; or,\n      *\
    \  sending back zero or more \"ANS\" messages, each containing an\n         envelope,\
    \ followed by a \"NUL\" message.\n      Regardless, no state change occurs.\n"
- title: 2.1 Profile Initialization
  contents:
  - "2.1 Profile Initialization\n   The boot message is used for two purposes:\n \
    \     resource identification: each channel bound to the BEEP profile\n      for\
    \ SOAP provides access to a single resource (a network data\n      object or service).\n\
    \      feature negotiation: if new features of SOAP (such as compression)\n  \
    \    emerge, their use can be negotiated.\n   The DTD syntax for the boot message\
    \ and its response are:\n       <!ELEMENT bootmsg     EMPTY>\n       <!ATTLIST\
    \ bootmsg\n                 resource    CDATA             #REQUIRED\n        \
    \         features    NMTOKENS          \"\">\n       <!ELEMENT bootrpy     EMPTY>\n\
    \       <!ATTLIST bootrpy\n                 features    NMTOKENS          \"\"\
    >\n   The boot message contains a mandatory and an optional attribute:\n   o \
    \ the \"resource\" attribute, which is analagous to HTTP's \"abs_path\"\n    \
    \  Request-URI parameter (c.f., Section 5.1.2 of [3]); and,\n   o  the \"features\"\
    \ attribute, which, if present, contains one or more\n      feature tokens, each\
    \ indicating an optional feature of the BEEP\n      profile for SOAP that is being\
    \ requested for possible use over the\n      channel.\n   Section 6.1 defines\
    \ a registration template for optional features.\n   If the peer acting in the\
    \ server role recognizes the requested\n   resource, it replies with the boot\
    \ response that contains one\n   optional attribute:\n   o  the \"features\" attribute,\
    \ if present, contains a subset of the\n      feature tokens in the boot message,\
    \ indicating which features may\n      be used over the channel.  (If not present\
    \ or empty, then no\n      features may be used.)\n   Otherwise, if the boot message\
    \ is improperly formed, or if the\n   requested resource isn't recognized, the\
    \ peer acting in the server\n   role replies with an error message (c.f., Section\
    \ 7.1 of [2]).\n   Typically, the boot message and its response are exchanged\
    \ during\n   channel initialization (c.f., Section 2.3.1.2 of [2]).\n   For example,\
    \ here the boot message and its response are exchanged\n   during channel initialization:\n\
    \       C: <start number='1' serverName='stockquoteserver.example.com'>\n    \
    \   C:     <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/soap'>\n       C:         <![CDATA[<bootmsg\
    \ resource='/StockQuote' />]]>\n       C:     </profile>\n       C: </start>\n\
    \       S: <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/soap'>\n       S:     <![CDATA[<bootrpy\
    \ />]]>\n       S: </profile>\n   The channel bound to the BEEP profile for SOAP\
    \ is now in the \"ready\"\n   state.\n   Alternatively, here is an example in\
    \ which the boot exchange is\n   unsuccessful:\n       C: <start number='1' serverName='stockquoteserver.example.com'>\n\
    \       C:     <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/soap'>\n       C:         <![CDATA[<bootmsg\
    \ resource='/StockPick' />]]>\n       C:     </profile>\n       C: </start>\n\
    \       S: <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/soap'>\n       S:     <![CDATA[<error\
    \ code='550'>resource not\n       S:                                supported</error>]]>\n\
    \       S: </profile>\n   Although the channel was created successfully, it remains\
    \ in the\n   \"boot\" state.\n"
- title: 3. SOAP Message Packages
  contents:
  - "3. SOAP Message Packages\n   The BEEP profile for SOAP transmits envelopes encoded\
    \ as UTF-8 using\n   the media type \"application/xml\"[4], e.g.,\n   MSG 1 1\
    \ . 0 364\n   Content-Type: application/xml\n   <SOAP-ENV:Envelope\n     xmlns:SOAP-ENV=\"\
    http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\"\n     SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/\"\

    \   </SOAP-ENV:Body>\n   </SOAP-ENV:Envelope>\n   END\n   In addition, the BEEP\
    \ profile for SOAP also allows envelopes to be\n   transmitted as the root part\
    \ of a \"multipart/related\"[5] content, and\n   with subordinate parts referenced\
    \ using the rules of Section 3 of [6]\n   (i.e., using either the \"Content-ID:\"\
    [7] or \"Content-Location:\"[8]\n   headers), e.g.,\n   MSG 1 2 . 364 668\n  \
    \ Content-Type: multipart/related; boundary=\"MIME_boundary\";\n             \
    \    type=application/xml;\n                 start=\"<claim061400a.xml@claiming-it.com>\"\
    \n   --MIME_boundary\n   Content-Type: application/xml\n   Content-ID: <claim061400a.xml@claiming-it.com>\n\
    \   <?xml version='1.0' ?>\n   <SOAP-ENV:Envelope\n     xmlns:SOAP-ENV=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\"\
    >\n   <SOAP-ENV:Body>\n   ..\n   <theSignedForm href=\"cid:claim061400a.tiff@claiming-it.com\"\

    \ <claim061400a.tiff@claiming-it.com>\n   ...binary TIFF image...\n   --MIME_boundary--\n\
    \   END\n   Consistent with Section 2 of [6], it is strongly recommended that\
    \ the\n   multipart contain a \"start\" parameter, and that the root part contain\n\
    \   a \"Content-ID:\" header.  However, because BEEP provides an 8bit-wide\n \
    \  path, a \"transformative\" Content-Transfer-Encoding (e.g., \"base64\" or\n\
    \   \"quoted-printable\") should not be used.  Further note that MIME[9]\n   requires\
    \ that the value of the \"Content-ID\" header be globally\n   unique.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1 One-way Message\n   A one-way message involves sending a message without\
    \ any response\n   being returned.\n   The BEEP profile for SOAP achieves this\
    \ using a one-to-many exchange,\n   in which the client sends a \"MSG\" message\
    \ containing an envelope, and\n   the server immediately sends back a \"NUL\"\
    \ message, before processing\n   the contents of the envelope.\n"

    \ sends a \"MSG\" message containing an envelope, and\n   the server sends back\

    \ SOAP does not use the \"ERR\" message for\n   SOAP faults when performing one-to-one\
    \ exchanges -- whatever response\n   is generated by the server is always returned\
    \ in the \"RPY\" message.\n"

  - "5. URL Schemes\n   This memo defines two URL schemes, \"soap.beep\" and \"soap.beeps\"\
    ,\n   which identify the use of SOAP over BEEP over TCP.  Note that, at\n   present,\
    \ a \"generic\" URL scheme for SOAP is not defined.\n"
- title: 5.1 The soap.beep URL Scheme
  contents:
  - "5.1 The soap.beep URL Scheme\n   The \"soap.beep\" URL scheme uses the \"generic\
    \ URI\" syntax defined in\n   Section 3 of [10], specifically:\n   o  the value\
    \ \"soap.beep\" is used for the scheme component; and,\n   o  the server-based\
    \ naming authority defined in Section 3.2.2 of [10]\n      is used for the authority\
    \ component.\n   o  the path component maps to the \"resource\" component of the\
    \ boot\n      message sent during profile initialization (if absent, it defaults\n\
    \      to \"/\").\n   The values of both the scheme and authority components are\
    \ case-\n   insensitive.\n   For example, the URL\n       soap.beep://stockquoteserver.example.com/StockQuote\n\
    \   might result in the example shown in Section 2.1.\n"
- title: 5.1.1 Resolving IP/TCP Address Information
  contents:
  - "5.1.1 Resolving IP/TCP Address Information\n   The \"soap.beep\" URL scheme indicates\
    \ the use of the BEEP profile for\n   SOAP running over TCP/IP.\n   If the authority\
    \ component contains a domain name and a port number,\n   e.g.,\n       soap.beep://stockquoteserver.example.com:1026\n\
    \   then the DNS is queried for the A RRs corresponding to the domain\n   name,\
    \ and the port number is used directly.\n   If the authority component contains\
    \ a domain name and no port number,\n   e.g.,\n       soap.beep://stockquoteserver.example.com\n\
    \   the SRV algorithm[11] is used with a service parameter of \"soap-beep\"\n\
    \   and a protocol parameter of \"tcp\" to determine the IP/TCP addressing\n \
    \  information.  If no appropriate SRV RRs are found (e.g., for \"_soap-\n   beep._tcp.stockquoteserver.example.com\"\
    ), then the DNS is queried for\n   the A RRs corresponding to the domain name\
    \ and the port number used\n   is assigned by the IANA for the registration in\
    \ Section 7.4.\n   If the authority component contains an IP address, e.g.,\n\
    \       soap.beep://10.0.0.2:1026\n   then the DNS is not queried, and the IP\
    \ address is used directly.  If\n   a port number is present, it is used directly;\
    \ otherwise, the port\n   number used is assigned by the IANA for the registration\
    \ in Section\n   7.4.\n   While the use of literal IPv6 addresses in URLs is discouraged,\
    \ if a\n   literal IPv6 address is used in a \"soap.beep\" URL, it must conform\
    \ to\n   the syntax specified in [12].\n"
- title: 5.2 The soap.beeps URL Scheme
  contents:
  - "5.2 The soap.beeps URL Scheme\n   The \"soap.beeps\" URL scheme is identical,\
    \ in all ways, to the\n   \"soap.beep\" URL scheme specified in Section 5.1, with\
    \ the exception\n   that prior to starting the BEEP profile for SOAP, the BEEP\
    \ session\n   must be tuned for privacy.  In particular, note that both URL schemes\n\
    \   use the identical algorithms and parameters for address resolution as\n  \
    \ specified in Section 5.1.1 (e.g., the same service name for SRV\n   lookups,\

  - "8. Security Considerations\n   Although service provisioning is a policy matter,\
    \ at a minimum, all\n   implementations must provide the following tuning profiles:\n\
    \   for authentication: http://iana.org/beep/SASL/DIGEST-MD5\n   for confidentiality:\
    \ http://iana.org/beep/TLS (using the\n      TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher)\n\
    \   for both: http://iana.org/beep/TLS (using the\n      TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA\
    \ cipher supporting client-side\n      certificates)\n   Further, implementations\
    \ may choose to offer MIME-based security\n   services providing message integrity\
    \ and confidentiality, such as\n   OpenPGP[13] or S/MIME[14].\n   Regardless,\
    \ consult [2]'s Section 9 for a discussion of BEEP-specific\n   security issues.\n"

    \ 7.3, respectively.\n   The IANA has also registered \"SOAP over BEEP\" as a\

    \ a list of SOAP profile features, c.f.,\n   Section 6.1.  The IESG is responsible\
    \ for assigning a designated\n   expert to review the specification prior to the\
    \ IANA making the\n   assignment.  Prior to contacting the IESG, developers of\
