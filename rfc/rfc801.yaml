  - "------------\n   ARPA sponsored research on computer networks led to the development\n\
    \   of the ARPANET.  The installation of the ARPANET began in September\n   1969,\
    \ and regular operational use was underway by 1971.  The ARPANET\n   has been\
    \ an operational service for at least 10 years.  Even while it\n   has provided\
    \ a reliable service in support of a variety of computer\n   research activities,\
    \ it has itself been a subject of continuing\n   research, and has evolved significantly\
    \ during that time.\n   In the past several years ARPA has sponsored additional\
    \ research on\n   computer networks, principally networks based on different underlying\n\
    \   communication techniques, in particular, digital packet broadcast\n   radio\
    \ and satellite networks.  Also, in the ARPA community there has\n   been significant\
    \ work on local networks.\n   It was clear from the start of this research on\
    \ other networks that\n   the base host-to-host protocol used in the ARPANET was\
    \ inadequate for\n   use in these networks.  In 1973 work was initiated on a host-to-host\n\
    \   protocol for use across all these networks.  The result of this long\n   effort\
    \ is the Internet Protocol (IP) and the Transmission Control\n   Protocol (TCP).\n\
    \   These protocols allow all hosts in the interconnected set of these\n   networks\
    \ to share a common interprocess communication environment.\n   The collection\
    \ of interconnected networks is called the ARPA Internet\n   (sometimes called\
    \ the \"Catenet\").\n   The Department of Defense has recently adopted the internet\
    \ concept\n   and the IP and TCP protocols in particular as DoD wide standards\
    \ for\n   all DoD packet networks, and will be transitioning to this\n   architecture\
    \ over the next several years.  All new DoD packet\n   networks will be using\
    \ these protocols exclusively.\n   The time has come to put these protocols into\
    \ use in the operational\n   ARPANET, and extend the logical connectivity of the\
    \ ARPANET hosts to\n   include hosts in other networks participating in the ARPA\
    \ Internet.\n   As with all new systems, there will be some aspects which are\
    \ not as\n   robust and efficient as we would like (just as with the initial\n\
    \   ARPANET).  But with your help, these problems can be solved and we\n     \
    \                                            NCP/TCP Transition Plan\n   can move\
    \ into an environment with significantly broader communication\n   services.\n"

  - "----------\n   The implementation of IP/TCP on several hosts has already been\n\
    \   completed, and the use of some services is underway.  It is urgent\n   that\
    \ the implementation of of IP/TCP be begun on all other ARPANET\n   hosts as soon\
    \ as possible and no later than 1 January 1982 in any\n   case.  Any new host\
    \ connected to the ARPANET should only implement\n   IP/TCP and TCP-based services.\
    \  Several important implementation\n   issues are discussed in the last section\
    \ of this memo.\n   Because all hosts can not be converted to TCP simultaneously,\
    \ and\n   some will implement only IP/TCP, it will be necessary to provide\n \
    \  temporarily for communication between NCP-only hosts and TCP-only\n   hosts.\
    \  To do this certain hosts which implement both NCP and IP/TCP\n   will be designated\
    \ as relay hosts.  These relay hosts will support\n   Telnet, FTP, and Mail services\
    \ on both NCP and TCP.  These relay\n   services will be provided  beginning in\
    \ November 1981, and will be\n   fully in place in January 1982.\n   Initially\
    \ there will be many NCP-only hosts and a few TCP-only hosts,\n   and the load\
    \ on the relay hosts will be relatively light.  As time\n   goes by, and the conversion\
    \ progresses, there will be more TCP\n   capable hosts, and fewer NCP-only hosts,\
    \ plus new TCP-only hosts.\n   But, presumably most hosts that are now NCP-only\
    \ will implement\n   IP/TCP in addition to their NCP and become \"dual protocol\"\
    \ hosts.\n   So, while the load on the relay hosts will rise, it will not be a\n\
    \   substantial portion of the total traffic.\n   The next section expands on\
    \ this plan, and the following section\n   gives some milestones in the transition\
    \ process.  The last section\n   lists the key documents describing the new protocols\
    \ and services.\n   Appendices present scenarios for use of the relay services.\n"

  - "----------------\n   The goal is to make a complete switch over from the NCP\
    \ to IP/TCP by\n   1 January 1983.\n      It is the task of each host organization\
    \ to implement IP/TCP for\n      its own hosts.  This implementation task must\
    \ begin by\n      1 January 1982.\n                                          \
    \       NCP/TCP Transition Plan\n      IP:\n         This is specified in RFCs\
    \ 791 and 792.  Implementations exist\n         for several machines and operating\
    \ systems.  (See Appendix D.)\n      TCP:\n         This is specified in RFC793.\
    \  Implementations exist for several\n         machines and operating systems.\
    \  (See Appendix D.)\n   It is not enough to implement the IP/TCP protocols, the\
    \ principal\n   services must be available on this IP/TCP base as well.  The\n\
    \   principal services are: Telnet, File Transfer, and Mail.\n      It is the\
    \ task of each host organization to implement the\n      principal services for\
    \ its own hosts.  These implementation tasks\n      must begin by 1 January 1982.\n\
    \      Telnet:\n         This is specified in RFC 764.  It is very similar to\
    \ the Telnet\n         used with the NCP.  The primary differences are that the\
    \ ICP is\n         eliminated, and the NCP Interrupt is replaced with the TCP\n\
    \         Urgent.\n      FTP:\n         This is specified in RFC 765.  It is very\
    \ similar to the FTP\n         used with the NCP.  The primary differences are\
    \ that in\n         addition to the changes for Telnet, that the data channel\
    \ is\n         limited to 8-bit bytes so FTP features to use other\n         transmission\
    \ byte sizes are eliminated.\n      Mail:\n         This is specified in RFC 788.\
    \  Mail is separated completely\n         from FTP and handled by a distinct server.\
    \  The procedure is\n         similar in concept to the old FTP/NCP mail procedure,\
    \ but is\n         very different in detail, and supports additional functions\
    \ --\n         especially mail relaying, and multi-recipient delivery.\n   Beyond\
    \ providing the principal services in the new environment, there\n   must be provision\
    \ for interworking between the new environment and\n   the old environment between\
    \ now and January 1983.\n      For Telnet, there will be provided one or more\
    \ relay hosts.  A\n      Telnet relay host will implement both the NCP and TCP\
    \ environments\n      and both user and server Telnet in both environments.  Users\n\
    \      requiring Telnet service between hosts in different environments\n    \
    \                                             NCP/TCP Transition Plan\n      will\
    \ first connect to a Telnet relay host and then connect to the\n      destination\
    \ host.  (See Appendix A.)\n      For FTP, there will be provided one or more\
    \ relay hosts.  An FTP\n      relay host will implement both the NCP and TCP environments,\
    \ both\n      user and server Telnet, and both user and server FTP in both\n \
    \     environments.  Users requiring FTP service between hosts in\n      different\
    \ environments will first connect via Telnet to an FTP\n      relay host, then\
    \ use FTP to move the file from the file donor host\n      to the FTP relay host,\
    \ and finally use FTP to move the file from\n      the FTP relay host to the file\
    \ acceptor host.  (See Appendix B.)\n      For Mail, hosts will implement the\
    \ new Simple Mail Transfer\n      Protocol (SMTP) described in RFC 788.  The SMTP\
    \ procedure provides\n      for relaying mail among several protocol environments.\
    \  For\n      TCP-only hosts, using SMTP will be sufficient.  For NCP-only hosts\n\
    \      that have not been modified to use SMTP, the special syntax\n      \"user.host@forwarder\"\
    \ may be used to relay mail via one or more\n      special forwarding host.  Several\
    \ mail relay hosts will relay mail\n      via SMTP procedures between the NCP\
    \ and TCP environments, and at\n      least one special forwarding host will be\
    \ provided.  (See\n      Appendix C.)\n"

  - "---------------------\n   There are several implementation issues that need attention,\
    \ and\n   there are some associated facilities with these protocols that are\n\
    \   not necessarily obvious.  Some of these may need to be upgraded or\n   redesigned\
    \ to work with the new protocols.\n   Name Tables\n      Most hosts have a table\
    \ for converting character string names of\n      hosts to numeric addresses.\
    \  There are two effects of this\n      transition that may impact a host's table\
    \ of host names: (1) there\n      will be many more names, and (2) there may be\
    \ a need to note the\n      protocol capability of each host (SMTP/TCP, SMTP/NCP,\
    \ FTP/NCP,\n      etc.).\n      Some hosts have kept this table in the operating\
    \ system address\n      space to provide for fast translation using a system call.\
    \  This\n      may not be practical in the future.\n      There may be applications\
    \ that could take alternate actions if\n      they could easily determine if a\
    \ remote host supported a\n      particular protocol.  It might be useful to extend\
    \ host name\n      tables to note which protocols are supported.\n      It might\
    \ be necessary for the host name table to contain names of\n      hosts reachable\
    \ only via relays if this name table is used to\n      verify the spelling of\
    \ host names in application programs such as\n      mail composition programs.\n\
    \      It might be advantageous to do away with the host name table and\n    \
    \  use a Name Server instead, or to keep a relatively small table as\n      a\
    \ cache of recently used host names.\n      A format, distribution, and update\
    \ procedure for the expanded host\n      table will be published soon.\n   Mail\
    \ Programs\n      It may be possible to move to the new SMTP mail procedures by\n\
    \      changing only the mailer-daemon and implementing the SMTP-server,\n   \
    \   but in some hosts there may be a need to make some small changes\n      to\
    \ some or all of the mail composition programs.\n      There may be a need to\
    \ allow users to identify relay hosts for\n      messages they send.  This may\
    \ require a new command or address\n      syntax not now currently allowed.\n\

    \ IP/TCP\n      Continuing use of IP and TCP will lead to a better understanding\n\
    \      of the performance characteristics and parameters.  Implementers\n    \
    \  should expect to make small changes from time to time to improve\n      performance.\n\
    \   Shortcuts\n      There are some very tempting shortcuts in the implementation\
    \ of IP\n      and TCP.  DO NOT BE TEMPTED!  Others have and they have been\n\
    \      caught!  Some deficiencies with past implementations that must be\n   \
    \   remedied and are not allowed in the future are the following:\n         IP\
    \ problems:\n            Some IP implementations did not verify the IP header\n\
    \            checksum.\n            Some IP implementations did not implement\
    \ fragment\n            reassembly.\n            Some IP implementations used\
    \ static and limited routing\n            information, and did not make use of\
    \ the ICMP redirect\n            message information.\n            Some IP implementations\
    \ did not process options.\n            Some IP implementations did not report\
    \ errors they detected\n            in a useful way.\n         TCP problems:\n\
    \            Some TCP implementations did not verify the TCP checksum.\n     \
    \       Some TCP implementations did not reorder segments.\n            Some TCP\
    \ implementations did not protect against silly\n            window syndrome.\n\
    \            Some TCP implementations did not report errors they detected\n  \
    \          in a useful way.\n            Some TCP implementations did not process\
    \ options.\n         Host problems:\n            Some hosts had limited or static\
    \ name tables.\n                                                 NCP/TCP Transition\
    \ Plan\n   Relay Service\n      The provision of relay services has started. \
    \ There are two\n      concerns about the relay service: (1) reliability, and\
    \ (2) load.\n      The reliability is a concern because relaying puts another\
    \ host in\n      the chain of things that have to all work at the same time to\
    \ get\n      the job done.  It is desirable to provide alternate relay hosts if\n\
    \      possible.  This seems quite feasible for mail, but it may be a bit\n  \
    \    sticky for Telnet and FTP due to the need for access control of\n      the\
    \ login accounts.\n      The load is a potential problem, since an overloaded\
    \ relay host\n      will lead to unhappy users.  This is another reason to provide\
    \ a\n      number of relay hosts, to divide the load and provide better\n    \
    \  service.\n      A Digression on the Numbers\n      How bad could it be, this\
    \ relay load?  Essentially any \"dual\n      protocol\" host takes itself out\
    \ of the game (i.e., does not need\n      relay services). Let us postulate that\
    \ the number of NCP-only\n      hosts times the number of TCP-only hosts is a\
    \ measure of the relay\n      load.\n      Total Hosts  Dual Hosts  NCP Hosts\

    \ protocols may be implemented by\n      user-mode programs via the \"Internet\
    \ User Queue\" interface. The\n      GGP or Gateway-Gateway Protocol is used to\

    \ it has two types\n      of connections -- normal data connections and \"TCP\
    \ Virtual\n      Terminal\" (TVT) connections.  The former are used for bulk data\n\
    \      transfers while the latter provide terminal access for remote\n      terminals.\n\
    \      Note that TVTs use the standard (\"New\") TELNET protocol.  This is\n \
    \     identical to that used on the ARPANET with NCP and in fact, is\n      largely\

    \ 1981\n      From:  Ed Cain <cain@EDN-UNIX>\n      This TCP/IP/ICMP implementation\
    \ runs as a user process in version\n      6 UNIX, with modifications obtained\
    \ from BBN for network access.\n      IP reassembles fragments into datagrams,\
    \ but has no separate IP\n      user interface.  TCP supports user and server\
    \ Telnet, echo,\n      discard, internet mail, and a file transfer service. ICMP\n\
    \      generates replies to Echo Requests, and sends Source-Quench when\n    \
    \  reassembly buffers are full.\n      Hardware - PDP-11/70 and PDP-11/45 running\
    \ UNIX version 6, with\n      BBN IPC additions.  Software - written in C, requiring\
    \ 25K\n      instruction space, 20K data space.  Supports 10 connections.\n  \

    \ Digital Technology Incorporated (DTI) IP/TCP for VAX/VMS\n      The following\
    \ describes the IP and TCP implementation that DTI\n      plans to begin marketing\
    \ in 4th Quarter 1981 as part of its\n      VAX/VMS network software package.\n\
    \      Hardware:  VAX-11/780 or /750.  Operating System:  DEC standard\n     \
    \ VAX/VMS Release 2.0 and above.  Implementation Language:   Mostly\n      C,\
    \ with some MACRO.  Connections supported:  Maximum of 64.\n      User level protocols\
    \ available:  TELNET, FTP, and MTP will be\n      available. (The NFE version\
    \ uses AUTODIN II protocols.)\n   MIT MULTICS\n      Date:  13 May 1981\n    \
    \  From:  Dave Clark <Clark@MIT-Multics>\n      Multics TCP/IP is implemented\
    \ in PL/1 for the HISI 68/80. It has\n      been in experimental operation for\
    \ about 18 months; it can be\n      distributed informally as soon as certain\
    \ modifications to the\n      system are released by Honeywell.  The TCP and IP\
    \ package are\n      currently being tuned for performance, especially high throughput\n\
    \      data transfer.\n      Higher level services include user and server telnet,\
    \ and a full\n      function MTP mail forwarding package.\n      The TCP and IP\
    \ contain good logging and debugging facilities,\n      which have proved useful\
    \ in the checkout of other implementations.\n      Please contact us for further\
    \ information.\n   SRI LSI-11\n      Date:  15 May 1981\n      From:  Jim Mathis\
    \ <mathis.tscb@Sri-Unix>\n      The IP/TCP implementation for the Packet Radio\
    \ terminal interface\n      unit is intended to run on an LSI-11 under the MOS\
    \ real-time\n      operating system.  The TCP is written in MACRO-11 assembler\n\
    \      language.  The IP is currently written in assembler language; but\n   \
    \   is being converted into C. There are no plans to convert the TCP\n      from\
    \ assembler into C.\n                                                 NCP/TCP\
    \ Transition Plan\n      The TCP implements the full specification.  The TCP appears\
    \ to be\n      functionally compatible with all other major implementations. \
    \ In\n      particular, it is used on a daily basis to provide communications\n\
    \      between users on the Ft. Bragg PRNET and ISID on the ARPANET.\n      The\
    \ IP implementation is reasonably complete, providing\n      fragmentation and\
    \ reassembly; routing to the first gateway; and a\n      complete host-side GGP\
    \ process.\n      A measurement collection mechanism is currently under development\n\
    \      to collect TCP and IP statistics and deliver them to a measurement\n  \
    \    host for data reduction.\n   UCLA IBM\n      Date:  13 May 1981\n      From:\
    \  Bob Braden <Braden@ISIA>\n      Hardware:  IBM 360 or 370, with a \"Santa Barbara\"\
    \ interface to the\n      IMP.\n      Operating System:  OS/MVS with ACF/VTAM.\
    \  An OS/MVT version is\n      also available.  The UCLA NCP operates as a user\
    \ job, with its own\n      internal multiprogramming and resource management mechanisms.\n\
    \      Implementation Language:  BAL (IBM's macro assembly language)\n      User-Level\
    \ Protocols Available:  User and Server Telnet\n"
