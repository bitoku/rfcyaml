  contents:
  - "1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of\
    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\
    \ please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are\
    \ accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information\
    \ Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network\
    \ Management Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms\
    \ defined in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies\
    \ a MIB\n   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n\
    \   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Introduction\n   This specification defines a portion of the MIB for use\

    \  Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol Version 3 (VRRPv3) for both IPv4\n   and\

- title: 4.  Relationship to RFC 2787
  contents:
  - "4.  Relationship to RFC 2787\n   This document obsoletes RFC 2787 [RFC2787].\
    \  The major changes in\n   this document reflect changes in the VRRP protocol\
    \ between RFC 2338\n   [RFC2338] and RFC 5798 [RFC5798].  This document is also\
    \ updated to\n   conform to current MIB conventions.\n"
- title: 5.  Relation to Interface Group (IF-MIB)
  contents:
  - "5.  Relation to Interface Group (IF-MIB)\n   Since a router can be participating\
    \ in VRRP on one or more\n   interfaces, \"ifIndex\" is used as an index into\
    \ the tables defined in\n   the VRRP MIB.  This MIB module imports ifIndex from\
    \ the IF-MIB.  At\n   this time, the latest version of the IF-MIB is from RFC\
    \ 2863\n   [RFC2863].\n"
- title: 6.  Multi-Stack Implementations
  contents:
  - "6.  Multi-Stack Implementations\n   This MIB module is designed to support multi-stack\
    \ implementations\n   that run VRRP over IPv4 and IPv6.  The IP version, Virtual\
    \ Router\n   Identifier (VRID), and ifIndex are used to uniquely identify rows\
    \ in\n   a multi-stack implementation.\n"
- title: 7.  Interpretation of RFC 5798
  contents:
  - "7.  Interpretation of RFC 5798\n   During the review of this document, it emerged\
    \ that there are\n   different possible interpretations of [RFC5798].  The authors\
    \ of that\n   document and the VRRP working group were unable to reach consensus\
    \ as\n   to which interpretation is correct.  This document makes the\n   following\
    \ assumption:\n      IPv4 and IPv6 virtual routers are treated as two separate\
    \ logical\n      entities and represented as two separate entries in the\n   \
    \   vrrpv3OperationsTable.  This is required due to the undefined\n      behavior\
    \ of the protocol in [RFC5798] in a multi-stack scenario.\n"
- title: 8.  VRRP MIB Structure and Design
  contents:
  - "8.  VRRP MIB Structure and Design\n   This MIB module contains three tables:\n\
    \   (1)  The vrrpv3OperationsTable contains objects that define the\n        operational\
    \ characteristics of a VRRP router.  Rows in this\n        table correspond to\
    \ instances of virtual routers.\n   (2)  The vrrpv3StatisticsTable contains the\
    \ operating statistics for\n        a VRRP router.\n   (3)  The vrrpv3AssociatedIpAddrTable\
    \ contains the addresses of the\n        virtual router(s) that a given VRRP router\
    \ is backing up.\n   Tables are indexed on ifIndex, VRID, and the IP version to\
    \ uniquely\n   identify a VRRP router.\n   Notifications in this MIB module are\
    \ controlled using the mechanisms\n   defined in [RFC3413].\n"
- title: 9.  VRRP Multi-Stack Scenario
  contents:
  - "9.  VRRP Multi-Stack Scenario\n   The following section provides examples of\
    \ how some of the objects in\n   this MIB are instantiated.\n   KEY:\n   ----\n\

- title: 11.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "11.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.\
    \  Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n\
    \   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment\
    \ without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.\
    \  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n\
    \   The objects vrrpv3OperationsPriority, vrrpv3OperationsPrimaryIpAddr,\n   vrrpv3OperationsAdvInterval,\
    \ vrrpv3OperationsPreemptMode,\n   vrrpv3OperationsAcceptMode, vrrpv3OperationsRowStatus,\
    \ and\n   vrrpv3AssociatedIpAddrRowStatus possess the read-create attribute.\n\
    \   Manipulation of these objects is capable of affecting the operation\n   of\
    \ a virtual router.\n   Examples of how these objects could adversely affect the\
    \ operation of\n   a virtual router include:\n   o An unauthorized change to vrrpv3OperationsPriority\
    \ can affect the\n     priority used in master election, resulting in this router\
    \ either\n     becoming master when it should not, or in some other router being\n\
    \     elected by preference.  While this will disrupt the operator's\n     plans,\
    \ it will only replicate the unfortunate failure of multiple\n     routers, and\
    \ any router that does become master will be capable of\n     filling that role.\n\
    \   o Modification of vrrpv3OperationsPrimaryIpAddr would cause the\n     configured\
    \ router to take on an incorrect IP address if it becomes\n     master, which\
    \ would be potentially very disruptive to the network\n     operation.\n   o A\
    \ malicious change to vrrpv3OperationsAdvInterval could either\n     result in\
    \ the configured router flooding the network with\n     advertisements when it\
    \ becomes master, or the new master not\n     advertising frequently enough such\
    \ that some routers do not learn\n     about the new master.\n   o vrrpv3OperationsPreemptMode\
    \ controls whether this router will\n     preempt another master router.  Setting\
    \ it inappropriately will at\n     worse cause one router to be master against\
    \ the operator's plans,\n     but that router will still be qualified to operate\
    \ as a master.\n   o Setting the vrrpv3OperationsAcceptMode could prevent an\n\
    \     IPv6-capable VRRP router from accepting packets addressed to the\n     address\
    \ owner's IPv6 address as its own even if it is not the IPv6\n     address owner.\
    \  Although the default for this object is false(2),\n     unauthorized setting\
    \ of this object to false might restrict the\n     function of some parts of the\
    \ network.\n   o The vrrpv3OperationsRowStatus object that could be used to disable\n\
    \     a virtual router.  While there are other columns that, if changed,\n   \
    \  could disrupt operations, they cannot be changed without first\n     changing\
    \ the RowStatus object.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate\
    \ security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n\
    \   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to\n   access\
    \ and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this\n   MIB module.\n\
    \   Implementations MUST provide the security features described by the\n   SNMPv3\
    \ framework (see [RFC3410]), including full support for\n   authentication and\
    \ privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)\n   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher\
    \ algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations\n   MAY also provide support for the Transport\
    \ Security Model (TSM)\n   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such\
    \ as SSH\n   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].\n   Further, deployment of SNMP\
    \ versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED\
    \ to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n\
    \   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance\
    \ of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects\
    \ only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET\
    \ or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"
