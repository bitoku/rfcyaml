- title: 1.  Overall Applicability
  contents:
  - "1.  Overall Applicability\n   The SIP extensions specified in this document make\
    \ certain\n   assumptions regarding network topology, linkage between SIP and\
    \ lower\n   layers, and the availability of transitive trust.  These assumptions\n\
    \   apply only to private networks and are not appropriate for use in an\n   Internet\
    \ environment.  The mechanisms specified here were designed to\n   satisfy the\
    \ requirements specified in the 3GPP Release 5 requirements\n   on SIP [RFC4083]\
    \ for which either no general-purpose solution was\n   planned (where insufficient\
    \ operational experience was available to\n   understand if a general solution\
    \ would be needed) or for which a more\n   general solution is not yet mature.\

- title: 4.1.  The P-Associated-URI Header Field
  contents:
  - "4.1.  The P-Associated-URI Header Field\n   This extension allows a registrar\
    \ to return a set of associated URIs\n   for a registered SIP address-of-record.\
    \  We define the P-Associated-\n   URI header field, used in the 200 (OK) response\
    \ to a REGISTER\n   request.  The P-Associated-URI header field contains the set\
    \ of\n   associated URIs that are associated with the registered address-of-\n\
    \   record.\n   In addition to the address-of-record, an associated URI is a URI\
    \ that\n   the service provider has allocated to a user.  A registrar contains\n\
    \   information that allows zero or more URIs to be associated with an\n   address-of-record.\
    \  Usually, all these URIs (the address-of-record\n   and the associated URIs)\
    \ are allocated for the usage of a particular\n   user.  This extension to SIP\
    \ allows the User Agent Client (UAC) to\n   know, upon a successful authenticated\
    \ registration, which other URIs,\n   if any, the service provider has associated\
    \ with an address-of-record\n   URI.\n   Note that, in standard SIP usage [RFC3261],\
    \ the registrar does not\n   register the associated URIs on behalf of the user.\
    \  Only the\n   address-of-record that is present in the To header field of the\n\
    \   REGISTER is registered and bound to the contact address.  The only\n   information\
    \ conveyed is that the registrar is aware of other URIs\n   that can be used by\
    \ the same user.\n   A situation may be possible, however, in which an application\
    \ server\n   (or even the registrar itself) registers any of the associated URIs\n\
    \   on behalf of the user by means of a third-party registration.\n   However,\
    \ this third-party registration is out of the scope of this\n   document.  A UAC\
    \ MUST NOT assume that the associated URIs are\n   registered.\n   If a UAC wants\
    \ to check whether any of the associated URIs is\n   registered, it can do so\
    \ by mechanisms specified outside this\n   document, e.g., the UA MAY send a REGISTER\
    \ request with the To header\n   field value set to any of the associated URIs\
    \ and without a Contact\n   header field.  The 200 (OK) response will include\
    \ a Contact header\n   field with the list of addresses-of-record that have been\
    \ registered\n   with contact addresses.  If the associated URI is not registered,\
    \ the\n   UA MAY register it prior to its utilization.\n"
- title: 4.1.1.  Applicability Statement for the P-Associated-URI Header Field
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  Applicability Statement for the P-Associated-URI Header Field\n   The\
    \ P-Associated-URI header field is applicable in SIP networks where\n   the SIP\
    \ provider allows a set of identities that a user can claim (in\n   header fields\
    \ like the From header field) in requests that the UA\n   generates.  Furthermore,\
    \ it assumes that the provider knows the\n   entire set of identities that a user\
    \ can legitimately claim and that\n   the user is willing to restrict its claimed\
    \ identities to that set.\n   This is in contrast to normal SIP usage, where the\
    \ From header field\n   is explicitly an end-user-specified field.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.  Usage of the P-Associated-URI Header Field
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  Usage of the P-Associated-URI Header Field\n   The registrar inserts\
    \ the P-Associated-URI header field into the 200\n   (OK) response to a REGISTER\
    \ request.  The header field value is\n   populated with a list of URIs that are\
    \ associated to the address-of-\n   record.\n   If the registrar supports the\
    \ P-Associated-URI header field extension\n   and there is at least one associated\
    \ URI, then the registrar MUST\n   insert the P-Associated-URI header field in\
    \ all the 200 (OK)\n   responses to a REGISTER request.  The absence of a P-Associated-URI\n\
    \   header field indicates that there are no associated URIs for the\n   registered\
    \ address-of-record.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.1.  Procedures at the UA
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.1.  Procedures at the UA\n   A UAC may receive a P-Associated-URI header\
    \ field in the 200 (OK)\n   response for a REGISTER request.  The presence of\
    \ a header field in\n   the 200 (OK) response for a REGISTER request implies that\
    \ the\n   extension is supported at the registrar.\n   The header field value\
    \ contains a list of one or more associated URIs\n   to the address-of-record.\
    \  The UAC MAY use any of the associated URIs\n   to populate the From header\
    \ field value, or any other SIP header\n   field value that provides information\
    \ of the identity of the calling\n   party, in a subsequent request.\n   The UAC\
    \ MAY check whether or not the associated URI is registered.\n   This check can\
    \ be done, e.g., by populating the To header field value\n   in a REGISTER request\
    \ sent to the registrar and without a Contact\n   header field.  The 200 (OK)\
    \ response will include a Contact header\n   field with the list of address-of-record\
    \ that have been registered\n   with contact addresses.  As described in SIP [RFC3261],\
    \ the 200 (OK)\n   response may contain a Contact header field with zero or more\
    \ values\n   (zero meaning the address-of-record is not registered).\n"
- title: 4.1.2.2.  Procedures at the Registrar
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.2.  Procedures at the Registrar\n   A registrar that receives and authorizes\
    \ a REGISTER request MAY\n   associate zero or more URIs with the registered address-of-record.\n\
    \   If the address-of-record under registration does not have any\n   associated\
    \ URIs, the P-Associated-URI header field SHALL NOT be\n   included.\n   Otherwise,\
    \ a registrar that supports this specification MUST include\n   a P-Associated-URI\
    \ header field in the 200 (OK) response to a\n   REGISTER request that contains\
    \ a contact header.  The header field\n   MUST be populated with a comma-separated\
    \ list of URIs that are\n   associated to the address-of-record under registration.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.3.  Procedures at the Proxy
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.3.  Procedures at the Proxy\n   This header is not intended to be used\
    \ by proxies -- a proxy does not\n   add, read, modify, or delete the header field;\
    \ therefore, any proxy\n   MUST relay this header field unchanged.\n"
- title: 4.2.  The P-Called-Party-ID Header Field
  contents:
  - "4.2.  The P-Called-Party-ID Header Field\n   A proxy server inserts a P-Called-Party-ID\
    \ header field, typically in\n   an INVITE request, en route to its destination.\
    \  The header is\n   populated with the Request-URI received by the proxy in the\
    \ request.\n   The User Agent Server (UAS) identifies to which address-of-record,\n\
    \   out of several registered addresses-of-record, the invitation was\n   sent\
    \ (for example, the user may be simultaneously using one personal\n   SIP URI\
    \ and one business SIP URI to receive invitation to sessions).\n   The UAS can\
    \ use the information to render different distinctive\n   audiovisual alerting\
    \ tones, depending on the URI used to receive the\n   invitation to the session.\n\
    \   Users in the 3GPP IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) may get one or\n   several\
    \ SIP URIs (address-of-record) to identify the user.  For\n   example, a user\
    \ may get one business SIP URI and one personal SIP\n   URI.  As an example of\
    \ utilization, the user may make available the\n   business SIP URI to coworkers\
    \ and may make available the personal SIP\n   URI to members of the family.\n\
    \   At a certain point in time, both the business SIP URI and the\n   personal\
    \ SIP URI are registered in the SIP registrar, so both URIs\n   can receive invitations\
    \ to new sessions.  When the user receives an\n   invitation to join a session,\
    \ he/she should be aware of which of the\n   registered SIP URIs this session\
    \ was sent to.\n   This requirement is stated in the 3GPP Release 5 requirements\
    \ on SIP\n   [RFC4083].\n   The problem arises during the terminating side of\
    \ a session\n   establishment.  At that time, the SIP proxy that is serving a\
    \ UA gets\n   an INVITE request, and the SIP server retargets the SIP URI that\
    \ is\n   present in the Request-URI, and replaces that SIP URI with the SIP\n\
    \   URI published by the user in the Contact header field of the REGISTER\n  \
    \ request at registration time.\n   One can argue that the To header field conveys\
    \ the semantics of the\n   called user, and therefore, this extension to SIP is\
    \ not needed.\n   Although the To header field in SIP may convey the called party\
    \ ID in\n   most situations, there are two particular cases when the above\n \
    \  assumption is not correct:\n   1.  The session has been forwarded, redirected,\
    \ etc., by previous SIP\n       proxies, before arriving to the proxy that is\
    \ serving the called\n       user.\n   2.  The UAC builds an INVITE request and\
    \ the To header field is not\n       the same as the Request-URI.\n   The problem\
    \ of using the To header field is that this field is\n   populated by the UAC\
    \ and not modified by proxies in the path.  If the\n   UAC, for any reason, did\
    \ not populate the To header field with the\n   address-of-record of the destination\
    \ user, then the destination user\n   is not able to distinguish to which address-of-record\
    \ the session was\n   destined.\n   Another possible solution to the problem is\
    \ built upon the\n   differentiation of the Contact header field value between\
    \ different\n   address-of-record at registration time.  The UA can differentiate\n\
    \   each address-of-record it registers by assigning a different Contact\n   header\
    \ field value.  For example, when the UA registers the address-\n   of-record\
    \ sip:id1, the Contact header field value can be sip:id1@ua,\n   while the registration\
    \ of the address-of-record sip:id2 can be bound\n   to the Contact header field\
    \ value sip:id2@ua.\n   The solution described above assumes that the UA explicitly\
    \ registers\n   each of its addresses-of-record, and therefore, it has full control\n\
    \   over the contact address values assigned to each registration.\n   However,\
    \ if the UA does not have full control of its registered\n   addresses-of-record,\
    \ because of, e.g., a third-party registration,\n   the solution does not work.\
    \  This may be the case of the 3GPP\n   registration, where the UA may have previously\
    \ indicated to the\n   network, by means outside of SIP, that some other addresses-of-record\n\
    \   may be automatically registered when the UA registers a particular\n   address-of-record.\
    \  The requirement is covered in the 3GPP Release 5\n   requirements on SIP [RFC4083].\n\
    \   In the next paragraphs, we show an example of the problem, in the\n   case\
    \ in which there has been some sort of call forwarding in the\n   session, so\
    \ that the UAC is not aware of the intended destination URI\n   in the current\
    \ INVITE request.\n   We assume that a UA is registering to its proxy (P1).\n\

    \  A particular home\n   network may have roaming agreements with one or more\
    \ visited\n   networks.  The effect of this is that when a mobile terminal is\n\
    \   roaming, it can use resources provided by the visited network in a\n   transparent\
    \ fashion.\n   One of the conditions for a home network to accept the registration\n\
    \   of a UA roaming to a particular visited network, is the existence of\n   a\
    \ roaming agreement between the home and the visited network.  There\n   is a\
    \ need to indicate to the home network which network is the\n   visited network\
    \ that is providing services to the roaming UA.\n   3GPP user agents always register\
    \ to the home network.  The REGISTER\n   request is proxied by one or more proxies\
    \ located in the visited\n   network towards the home network.  For the sake of\
    \ a simple approach,\n   it seems sensible that the visited network includes an\
    \ identification\n   that is known to the home network.  This identification should\
    \ be\n   globally unique, and it takes the form of a quoted-text string or a\n\
    \   token.  The home network may use this identification to verify the\n   existence\
    \ of a roaming agreement with the visited network, and to\n   authorize the registration\
    \ through that visited network.\n   Note that P-Visited-Network-ID information\
    \ reveals the location of\n   the user, to the level of the coverage area of the\

    \ proxies between the UA\n       and the home network proxy via established relationships\
    \ between\n       the home network and the visited network, supported by the use\

  - "4.3.2.  Usage of the P-Visited-Network-ID Header Field\n   The P-Visited-Network-ID\
    \ header field is used to convey to the\n   registrar or home proxy in the home\
    \ network the identifier of a\n   visited network.  The identifier is a text string\
    \ or token that is\n   known by both the registrar or the home proxy at the home\
    \ network and\n   the proxies in the visited network.\n   Typically, the home\
    \ network authorizes the UA to roam to a particular\n   visited network.  This\
    \ action requires an existing roaming agreement\n   between the home and the visited\
    \ network.\n   While it is possible for a home network to identify one or more\n\
    \   visited networks by inspecting the domain name in the Via header\n   fields,\
    \ this approach has a heavy dependency on DNS.  It is an option\n   for a proxy\
    \ to populate the Via header field with an IP address, for\n   example, and in\
    \ the absence of a reverse DNS entry, the IP address\n   will not convey the desired\
    \ information.\n   Any SIP proxy in the visited network that receives any of the\n\
    \   requests indicated in Section 5.7 MAY insert a P-Visited-Network-ID\n   header\
    \ field when it forwards the request.  In case a REGISTER\n   request or other\
    \ request is traversing different administrative\n   domains (e.g., different\
    \ visited networks), a SIP proxy MAY insert a\n   new P-Visited-Network-ID header\
    \ field if the request does not contain\n   a P-Visited-Network-ID header field\
    \ with the same network identifier\n   as its own network identifier (e.g., if\
    \ the request has traversed\n   other different administrative domains).\n   Note\
    \ also that, there is no requirement for this header field value\n   to be readable\
    \ in the proxies.  Therefore, a first proxy MAY insert\n   an encrypted header\
    \ field that only the registrar can decrypt.  If\n   the request traverses a second\
    \ proxy located in the same\n   administrative domain as the first proxy, the\
    \ second proxy may not be\n   able to read the contents of the P-Visited-Network-ID\
    \ header field.\n   In this situation, the second proxy will consider that its\
    \ visited\n   network identifier is not already present in the value of the header\n\
    \   field, and therefore, it will insert a new P-Visited-Network-ID\n   header\
    \ field value (hopefully with the same identifier that the first\n   proxy inserted,\
    \ although perhaps, not encrypted).  When the request\n   arrives at the registrar\
    \ or proxy in the home network, it will notice\n   that the header field value\
    \ is repeated (both the first and the\n   second proxy inserted it).  The decrypted\
    \ values should be the same,\n   because both proxies where part of the same administrative\
    \ domain.\n   While this situation is not desirable, it does not create any harm\
    \ at\n   the registrar or proxy in the home network.\n   The P-Visited-Network-ID\
    \ header field is normally used at\n   registration.  However, this extension\
    \ does not preclude other\n   usages.  For example, a proxy located in a visited\
    \ network that does\n   not maintain registration state MAY insert a P-Visited-Network-ID\n\
    \   header field into any standalone request outside a dialog or a\n   request\
    \ that creates a dialog.  At the time of writing this document,\n   the only requests\
    \ that create dialogs are INVITE requests [RFC3261],\n   SUBSCRIBE requests [RFC6665],\
    \ and REFER requests [RFC3515].\n   In order to avoid conflicts with identifiers,\
    \ especially when the\n   number of roaming agreements between networks increase,\
    \ care must be\n   taken when selecting the value of the P-Visited-Network-ID\
    \ header\n   field.  The identifier MUST be globally unique to avoid duplications.\n\
    \   Although there are many mechanisms to create globally unique\n   identifiers\
    \ across networks, one such mechanism is already in\n   operation, and that is\
    \ DNS.  The P-Visited-Network-ID header field\n   does not have any connection\
    \ to DNS, but the values in the header\n   field can be chosen from the DNS entry\
    \ representing the domain name\n   of the network.  This guarantees the uniqueness\
    \ of the value.\n"

    \ that provides the user with services.\n   In other cases, the SIP server that\
    \ provides the user with services\n   may simply wish to know crude location information\
    \ in order to\n   provide certain services to the user.  For example, many of\

    \ by.\n   Some regulatory requirements exist mandating that for cellular radio\n\
    \   systems, the identity of the cell where an emergency call is\n   established\
    \ is made available to the emergency authorities.\n   The SIP server that provides\
    \ services to the user may desire to have\n   knowledge about the access network.\
    \  This is achieved by defining a\n   new private SIP extension header field,\
    \ P-Access-Network-Info header\n   field.  This header field carries information\

    \  Field\n   This mechanism is appropriate in environments where SIP services\
    \ are\n   dependent on SIP elements knowing details about the IP and lower-\n\
    \   layer technologies used by a UA to connect to the SIP network.\n   Specifically,\
    \ the extension requires that the UA know the access\n   technology it is using,\
    \ and that a proxy desires such information to\n   provide services.  Generally,\
    \ SIP is built on the everything over IP\n   and IP over everything principle,\
    \ where the access technology is not\n   relevant for the operation of SIP.  Since\
    \ SIP systems generally\n   should not care or even know about the access technology,\
    \ this SIP\n   extension is not for general SIP usage.\n   The information revealed\
    \ in the P-Access-Network-Info header field is\n   potentially very sensitive.\
    \  Proper protection of this information\n   depends on the existence of specific\
    \ business and security\n   relationships amongst the proxies that will see SIP\
    \ messages\n   containing this header field.  It also depends on explicit knowledge\n\
    \   of the UA of the existence of those relationships.  Therefore, this\n   mechanism\

    \ proxy that is providing services, the\n   UA inserts a P-Access-Network-Info\
    \ header field into field the SIP\n   message.  This header contains information\
    \ on the access network that\n   the UA is using to get IP connectivity.  The\
    \ header is typically\n   ignored by intermediate proxies between the UA and the\
    \ SIP proxy that\n   is providing services.  The proxy providing services can\
    \ inspect the\n   header and make use of the information contained there to provide\n\
    \   appropriate services, depending on the value of the header.  Before\n   proxying\
    \ the request onwards to an untrusted administrative network\n   domain, this\
    \ proxy strips the header from the message.\n   Additionally, the first outbound\
    \ proxy, if in possession of\n   appropriate information, can also add a P-Access-Network-Info\

    \ involved in a transaction\n   about the common charging functional entities\
    \ to receive the\n   generated charging records or charging events.\n   The solution\
    \ provided by 3GPP is to define two types of charging\n   functional entities:\
    \ Charging Collection Function (CCF) and Event\n   Charging Function (ECF).  CCF\
    \ is used for offline charging (e.g., for\n   postpaid account charging).  ECF\
    \ is used for online charging (e.g.,\n   for pre-paid account charging).  There\
    \ may be more than a single\n   instance of CCF and ECF in a network, in order\
    \ to provide redundancy\n   in the network.  In case there are more than a single\
    \ instance of\n   either the CCF or the ECF addresses, implementations SHOULD\

    \   charging records generated from different entities that are related\n   to\
    \ the same session.\n   The correlation information includes, but is not limited\
    \ to, a\n   globally unique charging identifier that makes the billing effort\n\

  contents:
  - "4.6.3.  Usage of the transit-ioi\n   The transit-ioi is added to the P-Charging-Vector\
    \ header field when\n   traversing transit networks.  It is allowed to have multiple\n\
    \   transit-ioi values within one SIP message or response.  The values\n   within\
    \ the response are independent from the values set up within the\n   request.\n\
    \   The element could be added either by a transit network itself or by\n   the\
    \ succeeding network at the entry point where the preceding network\n   is known.\
    \  Based on network policy, a void value can be used.\n   Depending on the call\
    \ scenario, each transit network can add either a\n   transit network name or\
    \ a void value.  However, it cannot be\n   guaranteed that all the values that\
    \ are added will appear within the\n   P-Charging-Vector header field.\n   Some\
    \ networks can screen the P-Charging-Vector header field and\n   delete transit-ioi\
    \ values, e.g., networks not supporting this value.\n   There are scenarios where\
    \ the appearance of the transit-ioi values of\n   all networks is needed to have\
    \ a correct end-to-end view.\n   The policies of adding, modifying, and deleting\
    \ transit-ioi values\n   are out of the scope of this document.\n   The transit-ioi\
    \ contains an indexed value that MUST be incremented\n   with each value added\
    \ to the P-Charging-Vector header field.\n   A void value has no index.  By adding\
    \ the next value, the index has\n   to be incremented by the number of void entries\
    \ +1.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.1.  P-Associated-URI Header Field\n   The information returned in the P-Associated-URI\
    \ header field is not\n   viewed as particularly sensitive.  Rather, it is simply\
    \ informational\n   in nature, providing openness to the UAC with regard to the\
    \ automatic\n   association performed by the registrar.  If end-to-end protection\
    \ is\n   not used at the SIP layer, it is possible for proxies between the\n \
    \  registrar and the UA to modify the contents of the header value.\n   The lack\
    \ of encryption, either end-to-end or hop-by-hop, may lead to\n   leak some privacy\
    \ regarding the list of authorized identities.  For\n   instance, a user who registers\
    \ an address-of-record of\n   sip:user1@example.com may get another SIP URI associated\
    \ as\n   sip:first.last@example.com returned in the P-Associated-URI header\n\
    \   field value.\n   An eavesdropper could possibly collect the list of identities\
    \ a user\n   is registered.  This can have privacy implications.  To mitigate\
    \ this\n   problem, this extension SHOULD only be used in a secured environment,\n\
    \   where encryption of SIP messages is provided either end-to-end or\n   hop-by-hop\
    \ and where a trust relationship equivalent with that\n   defined in RFC 3325\
    \ [RFC3325] between entities exists.  That is, the\n   privacy of the user relies\
    \ on the other entities in the session not\n   disclosing information that they\
    \ have learned about the user.\n   While the P-Associated-URI header field value\
    \ allows the implicit\n   registration of a bundle of URIs with one REGISTER Message,\
    \ the\n   impact of security using the P-Associated-URI header field is no\n \
    \  higher than using separate REGISTER messages for each of the URIs.\n"
- title: 6.2.  P-Called-Party-ID Header Field
  contents:
  - "6.2.  P-Called-Party-ID Header Field\n   Due to the nature of the P-Called-Party-ID\
    \ header field, this header\n   does not introduce any significant security concern.\
    \  It is possible\n   for an attacker to modify the contents of the header.  However,\

    \ within a 3GPP environment, the P-Called-Party-ID is not\n   sent towards end\
    \ users but may be exchanged between carriers where\n   other security mechanisms\
    \ than SIP encryption are used.\n"

    \ the proxy in the\n   visited network that inserts the header, and the registrar\
    \ or the\n   home proxy, to modify the value of P-Visited-Network-ID header field.\n\
    \   Therefore, intermediaries participating in this mechanism MUST apply\n   a\

- title: 6.4.  P-Access-Network-Info Header Field
  contents:
  - "6.4.  P-Access-Network-Info Header Field\n   A Trust Domain is formally defined\
    \ in RFC 3324 [RFC3324].  For the\n   purposes of this document, we refer to the\
    \ 3GPP trust domain as the\n   collection of SIP proxies and application servers\
    \ that are operated\n   by a 3GPP network operator and are compliant with the\
    \ requirements\n   expressed in 3GPP TS 24.229 [TS24.229].\n   This extension\
    \ assumes that the access network is trusted by the UA\n   (because the UA's home\
    \ network has a trust relationship with the\n   access network), as described\
    \ earlier in this document.\n   This extension assumes that the information added\
    \ to the header by\n   the UAC should be sent only to trusted entities and MUST\
    \ NOT be used\n   outside of the trusted administrative network domain.\n   The\
    \ SIP proxy that provides services to the user, utilizes the\n   information contained\
    \ in this header to provide additional services\n   and UAs are expected to provide\
    \ correct information.  However, there\n   are no security problems resulting\
    \ from a UA inserting incorrect\n   information.  Networks providing services\
    \ based on the information\n   carried in the P-Access-Network-Info header field\
    \ will therefore need\n   to trust the UA sending the information.  A rogue UA\
    \ sending false\n   access network information will do no more harm than to restrict\
    \ the\n   user from using certain services.\n   The mechanism provided in this\
    \ document is designed primarily for\n   private systems like 3GPP.  Most security\
    \ requirements are met by way\n   of private standardized solutions.\n   For instance,\
    \ 3GPP will use the P-Access-Network-Info header field to\n   carry relatively\
    \ sensitive information like the cell ID.  Therefore,\n   the information MUST\
    \ NOT be sent outside of the 3GPP domain.\n   The UA is aware -- if it is a 3GPP\
    \ UA -- that it is operating within\n   a trusted domain.\n   The 3GPP UA is aware\
    \ of whether or not a secure association to the\n   home network domain for transporting\
    \ SIP signaling is currently\n   available, and, as such, the sensitive information\
    \ carried in the\n   P-Access-Network-Info header field MUST NOT be sent in any\
    \ initial\n   unauthenticated and unprotected requests (e.g., REGISTER).\n   Any\
    \ UA that is using this extension and is not part of a private\n   trusted domain\
    \ should not consider the mechanism as secure, and, as\n   such, MUST NOT send\
    \ sensitive information in the P-Access-Network-\n   Info header field.\n   Any\
    \ proxy that is operating in a private trust domain where the\n   P-Access-Network-Info\
    \ header field is supported is REQUIRED to delete\n   the header, if it is present,\
    \ from any message prior to forwarding it\n   outside of the trusted domain.\n\
    \   A proxy receiving a message containing the P-Access-Network-Info\n   header\
    \ field from an untrusted entity is not able to guarantee the\n   validity of\
    \ the contents.  Thus, this content SHOULD be deleted based\n   on local policy.\n"

- title: Appendix A.  Changes from RFC 3455
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Changes from RFC 3455\n   1.   Procedures for the P-Associated-URI\
    \ header field at a proxy.\n        RFC 3455 indicates that it defines no procedures\
    \ for the\n        P-Associated-URI header field at a proxy.  What is implicitly\n\
    \        meant here is that the proxy does not add, read, modify, or\n       \
    \ delete the header; therefore, RFC 3261 proxy procedures only\n        apply\
    \ to the header.\n   2.   P-Called-Party-ID header field and the History-Info\
    \ header\n        field: At the time RFC 3455 was written, the History-Info header\n\
    \        field was a long way from specification.  This header has now\n     \
    \   been specified and approved in RFC 7044.  It is acknowledged\n        that\
    \ the History-Info header field will provide equivalent\n        coverage to that\
    \ of the P-Called-Party-ID header field.\n        However, the P-Called-Party-ID\
    \ header field is used entirely\n        within the 3GPP system and does not appear\
    \ to SIP entities\n        outside that of a single 3GPP operator.\n   3.   Procedures\
    \ at the UA for the P-Charging-Function Addresses\n        header field: The text\
    \ in Section 4.5.2.1 of RFC 3455 does not\n        adequately take into account\
    \ procedures for UAs located inside\n        the private network, e.g., as gateways\
    \ and such that may play a\n        full part in network charging procedures.\
    \  Section 4.5.2.1 is\n        replaced with new text.\n   4.   The text in Section\
    \ 4.6.2.1 of RFC 3455 does not adequately take\n        into account procedures\
    \ for UAs located inside the private\n        network, e.g., as gateways and such\
    \ that may play a full part in\n        network charging procedures.  Section\
    \ 4.6.2.1 is now replaced\n        with new text.\n   5.   Recognition of additional\
    \ values of access technology in the\n        P-Access-Network-Info header field\
    \ (Section 4.4): A number of\n        new access technologies are contemplated\
    \ in 3GPP, and the reuse\n        of IMS to support Next Generation Networks (NGN)\
    \ is also\n        resulting in new access technologies.  Values for access\n\
    \        technologies are defined explicitly in RFC 3455, and no IANA\n      \
    \  procedures are defined to maintain a separate registry.  In\n        particular,\
    \ the new values: \"IEEE 802.11\", \"IEEE-802.11g\",\n        \"IEEE-802.11n\"\
    , \"ADSL\" / \"ADSL2\", \"ADSL2+\", \"RADSL\", \"SDSL\",\n        \"HDSL\", \"\
    HDSL2\", \"G.SHDSL\", \"VDSL\", \"IDSL\", \"IEEE-802.3\",\n        \"IEEE-802.3a\"\
    , \"IEEE-802.3e\", \"IEEE-802.3i\", \"IEEE-802.3j\",\n        \"IEEE-802.3u\"\
    , \"IEEE-802.3ab\", \"IEEE-802.3ae\", \"IEEE-802.3ak\",\n        \"IEEE-802.3aq\"\
    , \"IEEE-802.3an\", \"IEEE-802.3y\", \"IEEE-802.3z\",\n        and \"IEEE-802.3y\"\
    \ are defined.\n   6.   Replacement of existing value of access technology in\
    \ the\n        P-Access-Network-Info header field (Section 4.4): The value of\n\
    \        \"3GPP-CDMA2000\" was replaced long ago in 3GPP2 by three new\n     \
    \   values: \"3GPP2-1X\", \"3GPP2-1X-HRPD\", and \"3GPP2-UMB\".  It is not\n \
    \       believed that there was any deployment of the \"3GPP-CDMA2000\"\n    \
    \    value.\n   7.   Network-provided P-Access-Network-Info header field: The\n\
    \        P-Access-Network-Info header field may additionally be provided\n   \
    \     by proxies within the network.  This does not impact the values\n      \
    \  provided by a UA; rather, the header is repeated.  Such values\n        are\
    \ identified by the string \"network-provided\".  A special\n        class of\
    \ values are defined for use here, as the same\n        granularity of values\
    \ may not be possible as for those available\n        from the UA: \"3GPP-GERAN\"\
    , \"3GPP-UTRAN\", \"3GPP-WLAN\",\n        \"3GPP-GAN\", and \"3GPP-HSPA\".  Outbound\
    \ proxies remove P-Access-\n        Network-Info header fields containing the\
    \ \"network-provided\"\n        value.\n   8.   Definition of additional parameters\
    \ to the P-Charging-Vector\n        header field: Section 5.6 of RFC 3455 defines\
    \ the syntax of the\n        P-Charging-Vector header field.  Additional parameters\
    \ were\n        considered too application specific for specification in RFC\n\
    \        3455, but it was acknowledged that they would exist, and indeed\n   \
    \     additional specification of such parameters, relating to\n        specific\
    \ access technologies, has occurred in 3GPP.  Therefore,\n        this update\
    \ states that applications using the P-Charging-Vector\n        header field within\
    \ their own applicability are allowed to\n        define generic-param extensions\
    \ without further reference to the\n        IETF specification process.\n   9.\
    \   In Section 5.7, it was added that the P-Called-Party-ID can\n        appear\
    \ in the PUBLISH method.\n   10.  Referencing: RFC 3427 was deleted from the References\
    \ section as\n        it was not used within the document.  Various informative\n\
    \        references have now been published as RFCs and have been updated\n  \
    \      to include the appropriate RFC number.  References to 3GPP TS\n       \
    \ 32.200 were replaced by references to 3GPP TS 32.240 [TS32.240],\n        which\
    \ is the successor specification.  References to 3GPP TS\n        32.225 were\
    \ replaced by references to 3GPP TS 32.260 [TS32.260],\n        which is the successor\
    \ specification.  The referencing style was\n        changed to symbolic references.\
    \  Dates have been removed from\n        all 3GPP references (i.e., latest version\
    \ applies).\n   11.  Various editorial changes in alignment with style used in\
    \ RFC\n        3261 such as placing response code text in parentheses and using\n\
    \        words \"request\" and \"response\" in association with method names\n\
    \        have been applied.\n"
