  - "1.  Introduction\n   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture
    that\n   provides optimal multicast forwarding through a \"BIER domain\" without\n
    \  requiring intermediate routers to maintain any multicast-related,\n   per-flow
    state.  Neither does BIER explicitly require a tree-building\n   protocol for
    its operation.  A multicast data packet enters a BIER\n   domain at a Bit-Forwarding
    Ingress Router (BFIR) and leaves the BIER\n   domain at one or more Bit-Forwarding
    Egress Routers (BFERs).  The\n   BFIR router adds a BIER packet header to the
    packet.  The BIER packet\n   header contains a BitString in which each bit represents
    exactly one\n   BFER to forward the packet to.  The set of BFERs to which the\n
    \  multicast packet needs to be forwarded is expressed by the set of\n   bits
    in the BIER packet header.\n   The BIER architecture requires routers participating
    in BIER to\n   exchange BIER-related information within a given domain and permits\n
    \  link-state routing protocols to perform distribution of such\n   information.
    \ This document describes extensions to OSPF necessary to\n   advertise BIER-specific
    information in the case where BIER uses MPLS\n   encapsulation as described in
    [RFC8296].\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described
    in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\n   capitals,
    as shown here.\n"

  - "2.  Flooding of the BIER Information in OSPF\n   All BIER-specific information
    that a Bit-Forwarding Router (BFR)\n   needs to advertise to other BFRs is associated
    with a BFR-prefix.  A\n   BFR-prefix is a unique (within a given BIER domain)
    routable IP\n   address that is assigned to each BFR as described in detail in\n
    \  Section 2 of [RFC8279].\n   Given that BIER information must be associated

      in\n      Section 2 of [RFC8279].  If the BFR is not locally configured with\n
      \     a valid BFR-id, the value of this field is set to 0, which is\n      defined
      as illegal in [RFC8279].\n   BAR:  Single-octet BIER Algorithm used to calculate

      detect advertisement of duplicate valid BFR-ids for a\n   given MT-ID and sub-domain-id.
      \ When such duplication is detected by\n   the BFR, it MUST behave as described
      in Section 5 of [RFC8279].\n   The supported BAR and IPA algorithms MUST be
      consistent for all\n   routers supporting a given BFR sub-domain.  If a router
      receives a\n   BIER Sub-TLV advertisement with a value in the BAR or IPA fields
      that\n   does not match the locally configured value for a given BFR sub-\n
      \  domain, the router MUST report a misconfiguration for such BIER sub-\n   domain
      and MUST ignore the BIER Sub-TLV containing the error.\n   The use of non-zero

      \                Figure 1: BIER Propagation between Areas\n   The following
      procedure is used in order to propagate BIER-related\n   information between
      areas:\n      When an OSPF Area Border Router (ABR) advertises a Type-3 Summary\n
      \     LSA from an intra-area or inter-area prefix to all its attached\n      areas,
      it will also originate an OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque\n      LSA, as described
      in [RFC7684].  The flooding scope of the OSPFv2\n      Extended Prefix Opaque
      LSA type will be set to area-local.  The\n      route-type in the OSPFv2 Extended
      Prefix TLV is set to inter-area.\n      When determining whether a BIER Sub-TLV
      should be included in this\n      LSA, an OSPF ABR will:\n      *  Examine its
      best path to the prefix in the source area and find\n         the advertising
      router associated with the best path to that\n         prefix.\n      *  Determine
      if the advertising router advertised a BIER Sub-TLV\n         for the prefix.
      \ If yes, the ABR will copy the information from\n         that BIER Sub-TLV
      when advertising the BIER Sub-TLV to each\n         attached area.\n      In
      Figure 1, R1 advertises a prefix 192.0.2.1/32 in Area 1.  It\n      also advertises
      an OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSA for prefix\n      192.0.2.1/32 and includes

      it copies the entire BIER\n      Sub-TLV (including all of its Sub-TLVs) that
      it received from R1\n      in Area 1 and includes it in the OSPFv2 Extended
      Prefix Opaque LSA\n      it generates for 192.0.2.1/32 in Area 0.  ABR R3 calculates

  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   This document introduces new sub-TLVs for the
    existing OSPFv2\n   Extended Prefix TLV.  It does not introduce any new security
    risks to\n   OSPF.  Existing security extensions as described in [RFC2328] and\n
    \  [RFC7684] apply.\n   It is assumed that both the BIER and OSPF layers are under
    a single\n   administrative domain.  There can be deployments where potential\n
    \  attackers have access to one or more networks in the OSPF routing\n   domain.
    \ In these deployments, stronger authentication mechanisms\n   such as those specified
    in [RFC7474] SHOULD be used.\n   The Security Considerations section of [RFC8279]
    discusses the\n   possibility of performing a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack by
    setting\n   too many bits in the BitString of a BIER-encapsulated packet.\n   However,
    this sort of DoS attack cannot be initiated by modifying the\n   OSPF BIER advertisements
    specified in this document.  A BFIR decides\n   which systems are to receive a
    BIER-encapsulated packet.  In making\n   this decision, it is not influenced by
    the OSPF control messages.\n   When creating the encapsulation, the BFIR sets
    one bit in the\n   encapsulation for each destination system.  The information
    in the\n   OSPF BIER advertisements is used to construct the forwarding tables\n
    \  that map each bit in the encapsulation into a set of next hops for\n   the
    host that is identified by that bit, but the information is not\n   used by the
    BFIR to decide which bits to set.  Hence, an attack on\n   the OSPF control plane
    cannot be used to cause this sort of DoS\n   attack.\n   While a BIER-encapsulated
    packet is traversing the network, a BFR\n   that receives a BIER-encapsulated
    packet with n bits set in its\n   BitString may have to replicate the packet and
    forward multiple\n   copies.  However, a given bit will only be set in one copy
    of the\n   packet.  This means that each transmitted replica of a received\n   packet
    has fewer bits set (i.e., is targeted to fewer destinations)\n   than the received
    packet.  This is an essential property of the BIER\n   forwarding process as defined
    in [RFC8279].  While a failure of this\n   process might cause a DoS attack (as
    discussed in the Security\n   Considerations section of [RFC8279]), such a failure
    cannot be caused\n   by an attack on the OSPF control plane.\n   Implementations
    MUST ensure that malformed BIER and BIER MPLS\n   Encapsulation Sub-TLVs as defined
    in this document are detected and\n   that they do not provide a vulnerability
    for attackers to crash the\n   OSPF router or routing process.  Reception of malformed
    TLVs or sub-\n   TLVs SHOULD be counted and/or logged for further analysis.  Logging\n
    \  of malformed TLVs and sub-TLVs SHOULD be rate-limited to prevent a\n   DoS
    attack (distributed or otherwise) from overloading the OSPF\n   control plane.\n"
