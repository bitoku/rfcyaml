  - "Abstract\n   The original registration procedure for formal Uniform Resource
    Name\n   (URN) namespaces required IETF Consensus.  That requirement\n   discouraged
    some registrations and increased the risk for problems\n   that could occur as
    a result.  The requirements have now been changed\n   by RFC 8141, which adopts
    a different model, focusing on encouraging\n   registration and publication of
    information for all appropriate\n   namespaces.  This document clarifies the status
    of relevant older\n   RFCs and confirms and documents advice to IANA about selected\n
    \  existing registrations.  This document also obsoletes RFCs 3044 and\n   3187
    and moves them to Historic status.  These RFCs describe the ISSN\n   and ISBN
    namespaces, which are now outdated because the descriptions\n   reside in registration
    templates.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   As a part of the initial development of the Uniform Resource
    Name\n   (URN) system in the late 1990s, the IETF URN Working Group agreed\n   that
    it was important to demonstrate that the URN syntax could\n   accommodate existing
    identifier systems.  RFC 2288 [RFC2288] showed\n   the feasibility of using International
    Standard Book Number (ISBN),\n   International Standard Serial Number (ISSN),
    and Serial Item and\n   Contribution Identifier (SICI) [ANSI-SICI] as URNs; however,
    it did\n   not formally register corresponding URN namespaces.  This was in part\n
    \  due to the still-evolving process to formalize criteria for namespace\n   definition
    documents and registration, consolidated later by the IETF\n   into successive
    Namespace Definition Mechanism documents [RFC2611]\n   [RFC3406].\n   URN namespaces
    were subsequently registered for ISBN [RFC3187] and\n   ISSN [RFC3044] as well
    as for a fairly large collection of other\n   identifiers including National Bibliography
    Number (NBN) [RFC3188].\n   The comprehensive list can be found in the IANA Uniform
    Resource\n   Names (URN) Namespaces registry [IANA-URN] (see also Section 4).\n
    \  While a URN namespace for SICI could be registered at any time, the\n   SICI
    standard has not gained broad international acceptance and has\n   not had a namespace
    defined to date.\n   The predecessor registration procedure for URN namespaces
    [RFC3406]\n   required IETF Consensus for formal namespaces.  That requirement\n
    \  discouraged some registrations and increased the risk for problems,\n   including
    use of names without registration (\"squatting\").  If names\n   are not registered
    in a consistent way, there is a possibility of the\n   same name being used to
    identify different namespaces with different\n   rules, resulting in considerable
    confusion.  The requirements have\n   now been changed in RFC 8141 [RFC8141] to
    adopt a different model\n   that focuses more on encouraging registration of all
    namespaces that\n   follow the formal namespace syntax, with as much information\n
    \  collected as possible consistent with that goal.\n   Therefore, this document
    does the following:\n   o  Describes the instructions developed with IANA to adapt
    selected\n      existing registrations to the new model.  Those registration\n
    \     updates have been completed for ISBN and ISSN Namespace\n      Identifiers
    (NIDs) and URN namespaces.\n   o  Obsoletes the separate RFCs that specify the
    namespaces for ISSNs\n      and ISBNs to eliminate any ambiguity about the status
    of new\n      templates and updated registrations.\n   o  Provides information
    about the status of NBNs under the new\n      definitions.\n   o  Provides suggestions
    to IANA about the handling of other existing\n      registrations not explicitly
    discussed in this document.\n"

  - "2.  Obsoleting Older Registration RFCs for ISSNs and ISBNs\n   The existing RFCs
    that describe URN namespaces for ISSNs [RFC3044]\n   and ISBNs [RFC3187] have
    been identified as \"Historic\" concurrent\n   with publication of this document.
    \ The new registration templates\n   for those namespaces have already been submitted
    and incorporated\n   into the URN Namespaces registry by IANA.\n   Those updated
    templates reflect not only the new template formats but\n   substantive changes
    to the definitions of the namespaces.  The\n   significant changes are summarized
    in the subsections that follow.\n   For both ISSN and ISBN namespaces, URN registration
    practices within\n   them are expected to evolve along with the ISO ISBN and ISSN\n
    \  standards without requiring resubmission of the templates or other\n   formal
    IETF or IANA URN namespace registration update approval\n   procedures.  The subsections
    that follow clarify the relationship\n   between the original URN namespace registrations
    for ISBN and ISSN\n   and the recently registered templates that follow the principles
    of\n   RFC 8141.  Approval and registration of those new templates made the\n
    \  older templates obsolete.\n"

    - "2.1.  ISBN URN Changes\n   The revised ISBN namespace reflects the latest version
      of the ISO\n   ISBN standard, ISO 2108:2017 [ISO-ISBN-b].  The namespace allows
      for\n   the use of both the old ten-character ISBN numbers described in RFC\n
      \  3187 and ISO 2108:1992 [ISO-ISBN-a] (formerly known as ISBN-10) and\n   the
      thirteen-character identifiers introduced in ISO 2108:2005\n   [ISO-ISBN-c]
      (formerly known as ISBN-13).\n   For more details, review the new ISBN registration
      template and\n   associated documentation [ISBN-Template].\n"
    title: 2.1.  ISBN URN Changes
  - contents:
    - "2.2.  ISSN URN Changes\n   The updated ISSN namespace reflects the changes
      between the current\n   ISSN standard [ISO-ISSN] and its predecessor on which
      RFC 3044 was\n   based.  ISO 3297:2007 introduced the linking ISSN (ISSN-L),
      which is\n   designated for all media of a serial publication, irrespective
      of how\n   many there are.  Traditional ISSN applies to a single medium only,\n
      \  such as the printed version of a serial.\n   For more details, review the
      new ISSN registration template and\n   associated documentation [ISSN-Template].\n"

  title: 2.  Obsoleting Older Registration RFCs for ISSNs and ISBNs
- contents:
  - "3.  The Older Registration RFC for NBNs\n   NBN is not a formal international
    standard or even a single\n   identifier system but an umbrella concept that covers
    all of the\n   identifier systems the adopting national libraries and their partners\n
    \  use to identify resources that do not have other identifiers.  For\n   instance,
    if a book received via legal deposit does not have an ISBN,\n   the national library
    gives it a local identifier.  The NBN\n   specification provides a simple means
    of expressing these local\n   identifiers so that they become globally unique
    URNs, such as\n   urn:nbn:fi-fe19981001.\n   In addition to the namespace registration
    itself, RFC 3188 provides\n   some generic information about NBNs and their use
    and specifies the\n   syntax of URN:NBNs.  That syntax guarantees uniqueness by
    requiring\n   the usage of country codes and institutional identifiers as a part
    of\n   the Namespace Specific String (NSS).  When RFC 3188 is revised, it\n   should
    be accompanied with a template that revises the registration\n   of the URN:NBN
    namespace.\n"

  - "4.  Other Existing URN Registrations and RFCs\n   The RFC Series and the IANA
    URN Namespaces registry contain many URN\n   namespace registrations in addition
    to those for which this document\n   calls out explicit actions.  In general,
    those existing registrations\n   are still appropriate but omit some information
    called for in RFC\n   8141 [RFC8141].  Reregistration with new templates is recommended
    but\n   not required.  Until and unless those registrations are updated as\n   provided
    for in RFC 8141, the existing registration templates should\n   be read as not
    requiring or allowing any features that were not\n   allowed and specified by
    the earlier URN [RFC2141] and registration\n   [RFC3406] specifications.\n"
  title: 4.  Other Existing URN Registrations and RFCs
- contents:
  - "5.  Registration Examples\n   For examples of registrations using the new model
    and for information\n   and help in understanding other parts of this document,
    review the\n   new ISBN and ISSN registration templates [ISBN-Template]\n   [ISSN-Template]
    and associated documentation in the IANA URN\n   Namespaces registry.\n"
  title: 5.  Registration Examples
- contents:
  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has completed updates for the registry entries
    for URN ISSN and\n   ISBN namespaces to reflect the new templates that are compliant
    with\n   RFC 8141.  With respect to namespaces other than those listed above,\n
    \  when registrations and templates are available that conform to the\n   newer
    rules, they may be substituted for the older ones.  However,\n   neither this
    document nor RFC 8141 supersedes any existing\n   registrations (those for ISBN
    and ISSN are superseded by the recently\n   registered templates).  Therefore,
    IANA needs to be prepared to\n   maintain a registry whose contents reflect old-style
    templates for\n   some namespaces and the newer ones for others.\n   IANA should
    also note that the portions of the ISBN and ISSN\n   registrations that point
    to ISO Standards are intended to identify\n   current versions (which may change)
    rather than only the versions\n   that are active at the time this document is
    approved (see\n   Section 2).  That provision relies on ISO TC 46 and its respective\n
    \  registration authorities to maintain stability of URN references\n   discussed
    in this document.\n"
  title: 6.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   While particular URN namespaces and their registrations
    might\n   conceivably have security implications, this specification merely\n
    \  specifies a transition of a set of namespace registrations and does\n   not
    have such implications.  The security implications associated\n   with particular
    namespaces are expected to be listed in registration\n   templates as specified
    in RFC 8141.\n"
