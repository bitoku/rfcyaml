  - "1.  Introduction\n   Ethernet pseudowires are widely deployed to support packet\
    \ transport\n   of Ethernet services.  These services in-turn provide transport\
    \ for a\n   variety of client networks, e.g., IP and MPLS.  This document uses\n\
    \   procedures defined in the existing IETF specifications of Ethernet\n   pseudowires\
    \ carried over MPLS networks.\n   Many of the requirements for the services provided\
    \ by the mechanisms\n   explained in this document are also recognized by the\
    \ MPLS transport\n   profile (MPLS-TP) design effort formed jointly by the IETF\
    \ and ITU-T\n   [RFC5654].  For example, the ability to operate solely with network\n\
    \   management control, the ability to use Operations, Administration,\n   and\
    \ Maintenance (OAM) that does not rely on IP forwarding, and the\n   ability to\
    \ provide light-weight proactive connection verification\n   (CV) functionality.\n\
    \   The solution described in this document does not address all of the\n   MPLS-TP\
    \ requirements, but it provides a viable form of packet\n   transport service\
    \ using tools that are already available.\n   The key purpose of this document\
    \ is to demonstrate that there is an\n   existing IETF mechanism with known implementations\
    \ that satisfies the\n   requirements posed by the operator community.  It is\
    \ recognized that\n   it is possible to design a more efficient method of satisfying\
    \ the\n   requirements, and the IETF anticipates that improved solutions will\n\
    \   be proposed in the future as part of the MPLS-TP effort.  Indeed, the\n  \
    \ solution described in this document is not intended to detract from\n   the\
    \ MPLS-TP effort.  Instead, it provides legitimacy for that work by\n   showing\
    \ that there is a real demand from networks that are already\n   deployed, and\
    \ by indicating that the MPLS-TP solutions work is based\n   on sound foundations.\n\
    \   Much of the notation used in this document is defined in [RFC3985] to\n  \
    \ which the reader is referred for definitions.\n   The architecture required\
    \ for this mechanism is illustrated in Figure\n   1.\n     +----------------------------------------------------------------+\n\

  contents:
  - "3.  Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)\n   Within a connection,\
    \ traffic units sent from the single source are\n   constrained to stay within\
    \ the connection under defect-free\n   conditions.  During misconnected defects,\
    \ a connection can no longer\n   be assumed to be constrained, and traffic units\
    \ (and by implication\n   also OAM packets) can 'leak' unidirectionally outside\
    \ a connection.\n   Therefore, during a misconnected state, it is not possible\
    \ to rely on\n   OAM, which relies on a request/response mechanism, and, for this\n\
    \   reason, such OAM should be treated with caution if used for\n   diagnostic\
    \ purposes.\n   Further, when implementing an Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) function\n\
    \   with MPLS, use of the label stack as the path selector such that the\n   OAM\
    \ and data are not in a co-path SHOULD be avoided, as any failure\n   in the data\
    \ path will not be reflected in the OAM path.  Therefore,\n   an OAM that is carried\
    \ within the data-path below the PW label (such\n   as Virtual Circuit Connectivity\
    \ Verification (VCCV)) is NOT\n   vulnerable to the above failure mode.  For these\
    \ reasons, the OAM\n   mechanism is as described in [RFC5085], which uses Bidirectional\n\
    \   Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC5880] for connection verification\n   (CV).\
    \  The method of using BFD as a CV method in VCCV is described in\n   [RFC5885].\
    \  One of the VCCV profiles described in Section 3.1 or\n   Section 3.2 MUST be\
    \ used.  Once a VCCV control channel is provisioned\n   and the operational status\
    \ of the PW is UP, no other profile should\n   be used until such time as the\
    \ PW's operational status is set to\n   DOWN.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This RFC provides a description of the use of\
    \ existing IETF Proposed\n   Standards to solve a network problem, and raises\
    \ no new security\n   issues.\n   The PWE3 security considerations are described\
    \ in [RFC3985] and the\n   Ethernet pseudowire security considerations of [RFC4448].\n\
    \   The Ethernet pseudowire is transported on an MPLS PSN; therefore, the\n  \
    \ security of the pseudowire itself will only be as good as the\n   security of\
    \ the MPLS PSN.  The server MPLS PSN can be secured by\n   various methods, as\
    \ described in [RFC3031].\n   The use of static configuration exposes an MPLS\
    \ PSN to a different\n   set of security risks to those found in a PSN using dynamic\
    \ routing.\n   If a path is misconfigured in a statically configured network,\
    \ the\n   result can be a persistent black hole, or much worse, a persistent\n\
    \   forwarding loop.  On the other hand, most of the distributed\n   components\
    \ are less complex.  This is however offset by the need to\n   provide fail-over\
    \ and redundancy in the management and configuration\n   system and the communications\
    \ paths between those central systems and\n   the LSRs.\n   Security achieved\
    \ by access control of media access control (MAC)\n   addresses, and the security\
    \ of the client layers, is out of the scope\n   of this document.\n"
