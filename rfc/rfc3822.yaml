    \   Figure 1: FCIP Entity and SLPv2 Agent Relationship.\n   As indicated in Figure\
    \ 1, each FCIP Entity contains an FCIP Control\n   and Services Module that interfaces\
    \ to an SLPv2 SA and UA.\n   The SA constructs a service advertisement of the\
    \ type\n   \"service:fcip:entity\" for each of the service URLs it wishes to\n\
    \   register.  The service advertisement contains a lifetime, along with\n   other\
    \ attributes defined in the service template.\n   The remainder of the discovery\
    \ process is identical to that used by\n   any client/server pair implementing\
    \ SLPv2:\n   1. If an SLPv2 DA is found [RFC2608], the SA contacts the DA and\n\
    \      registers the service advertisement.  Whether or not one or more\n    \
    \  SLPv2 DAs are discovered, the SA maintains the service\n      advertisement\
    \ itself and answers multicast UA queries directly.\n   2. When the FCIP Entity\
    \ requires contact information for a peer FCIP\n      Entity, the UA either contacts\
    \ the DA using unicast or the SA\n      using multicast using an SLPv2 service\
    \ request.  The UA service\n      request includes a query, based on the attributes,\
    \ to indicate the\n      characteristics of the peer FCIP Entities it requires.\n\
    \   3. Once the UA has the IP address and port number of a peer FCIP\n      Entity,\
    \ it may begin the normal connection procedure, as described\n      in [RFC3821],\
    \ to a peer FCIP Entity.\n   The use of a DA is RECOMMENDED for SLPv2 operations\
    \ in an FCIP\n   environment.\n"

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The SLPv2 security model as specified in [RFC2608]\
    \ does not provide\n   confidentiality, but does provide an authentication mechanism\
    \ for UAs\n   to assure that service advertisements only come from trusted SAs\
    \ with\n   the exception that it does not provide a mechanism for authenticating\n\
    \   \"zero-result responses\".  See [RFC3723] for a discussion of the SLPv2\n\
    \   [RFC2608] security model.\n   Once an FCIP Entity is discovered, authentication\
    \ and authorization\n   are handled by the FCIP protocol.  It is the responsibility\
    \ of the\n   providers of these services to ensure that an inappropriately\n \
    \  advertised or discovered service does not compromise their security.\n   When\
    \ no security is used for SLPv2, there is a risk of distribution\n   of false\
    \ discovery information.  The primary countermeasure for this\n   risk is authentication.\
    \  When this risk is a significant concern,\n   IPsec SAs SHOULD be used for FCIP\
    \ traffic subject to this risk to\n   ensure that FCIP traffic only flows between\
    \ endpoints that have\n   participated in IKE authentication.  For example, if\
    \ an attacker\n   distributes discovery information falsely claiming that it is\
    \ an FCIP\n   endpoint, it will lack the secret information necessary to\n   successfully\
    \ complete IKE authentication, and hence will be prevented\n   from falsely sending\
    \ or receiving FCIP traffic.\n   There remains a risk of a denial of service attack\
    \ based on repeated\n   use of false discovery information that will cause the\
    \ initiation of\n   IKE negotiation.  The countermeasures for this are administrative\n\
    \   configuration of each FCIP Entity to limit the peers that it is\n   willing\
    \ to communicate with (i.e., by IP address range and/or DNS\n   domain), and maintenance\
    \ of a negative authentication cache to avoid\n   repeatedly contacting an FCIP\
    \ Entity that fails to authenticate.\n   These three measures (i.e., IP address\
    \ range limits, DNS domain\n   limits, negative authentication cache) MUST be\
    \ implemented.\n"
- title: 6.1.  Security Implementation
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Security Implementation\n   Security for SLPv2 in an IP storage environment\

    \   can be assumed to support IPsec.  SLP servers, however, cannot be\n   assumed\
    \ to implement IPsec, since there is no such requirement in\n   standard SLP.\
    \  In particular, SLP Directory Agents (DA) may be\n   running on machines other\
    \ than those running the IPS protocols.\n   IPsec SHOULD be implemented for SLPv2\
    \ as specified in [RFC3723]; this\n   includes ESP with a non-null transform to\
    \ provide both authentication\n   and confidentiality.\n   Because the IP storage\
    \ services have their own authentication\n   capabilities when located, SLPv2\
    \ authentication is OPTIONAL to\n   implement and use (as discussed in more detail\
