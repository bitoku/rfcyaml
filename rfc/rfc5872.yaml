  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document relaxes the IANA rules for the Protocol for
    Carrying\n   Authentication for Network Access (PANA) [RFC5191].  Rules for the\n
    \  following protocol fields, all defined in [RFC5191], are affected:\n   o  Message
    Types\n   o  Message Flags\n   o  Attribute-Value Pair (AVP) Flags\n   o  Result-Code
    AVP Values\n   o  Termination-Cause AVP Values\n   The rationale for this update
    is that there can be situations in\n   which it makes sense to grant an allocation
    under special\n   circumstances.  At the time of this writing, the IETF is in
    the\n   process of approving one such allocation.  By changing the current\n   IANA
    rules to allow for IESG Approval [RFC5226] as well, it has\n   become possible
    for the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) to\n   consider an allocation
    request, even if it does not fulfill the\n   default rule.  For instance, an experimental
    protocol extension could\n   perhaps deserve an allocation from a field of reserved
    bits, as long\n   as a sufficient number of bits still remain for other purposes,
    and\n   the PANA community is happy with such allocation.\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has updated the registries related to PANA Message
    Types,\n   Message Flags, AVP Flags, Result-Code AVP Values, and Termination-\n
    \  Cause AVP Values, as specified below.  All other PANA IANA registries\n   are
    to remain unchanged.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Message Types\n   The Message Types namespace is used to identify PANA
      messages.  Value\n   0 is not used and is not assigned by IANA.  The range of
      values from\n   1 - 65,519 are for permanent, standard Message Types, allocated
      by\n   IETF Review or IESG Approval [RFC5226].  Previously, the rule for\n   this
      range was allocation by IETF Review only.  [RFC5191] defined the\n   range of
      values from 1 - 4.  The same Message Type is used for both\n   the request and
      the answer messages, except for type 1.  The Request\n   bit distinguishes requests
      from answers.\n   The range of values from 65,520 - 65,535 (hexadecimal values
      0xfff0 -\n   0xffff) is reserved for experimental messages.  As these codes
      are\n   only for experimental and testing purposes, no guarantee is made for\n
      \  interoperability between the communicating PANA Client (PaC) and PANA\n   Authentication
      Agent (PAA) using experimental commands, as outlined\n   in [RFC3692].\n"

  - contents:
    - "2.2.  Message Flags\n   There are 16 bits in the Flags field of the PANA message
      header.\n   Section 6.2 of [RFC5191] assigned bit 0 ('R'), 1 ('S'), 2 ('C'),
      3\n   ('A'), 4 ('P'), and 5 ('I').  Allocations from the remaining free\n   bits
      in the PANA header Flag field are made via Standards Action or\n   IESG Approval
      [RFC5226].  Previously, the rule for these bits was\n   allocation by Standards
      Action only.\n"

      defined\n   in Section 6.3 of [RFC5191].  That RFC also assigned bit 0 ('V').\n
      \  The remaining bits are assigned via Standards Action or IESG Approval\n   [RFC5226].
      \ Previously, the rule for these bits was allocation by\n   Standards Action
      only.\n"

      Result-Code AVP (AVP\n   Code 7) defines the values from 0 - 2.\n   All remaining
      values are available for assignment via IETF Review or\n   IESG Approval [RFC5226].
      \ Previously, the rule for these values was\n   allocation by IETF Review only.\n"

      \  All remaining values are available for assignment via IETF Review or\n   IESG

  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   This specification does not change the security
    properties of PANA.\n   However, a few words are necessary about the use of the
    experimental\n   code points defined in Section 2.1.  Potentially harmful side
    effects\n   from the use of the experimental values need to be carefully\n   evaluated
    before deploying any experiment across networks that the\n   owner of the experiment
    does not entirely control.  Guidance given in\n   [RFC3692] about the use of experimental
    values needs to be followed.\n"
