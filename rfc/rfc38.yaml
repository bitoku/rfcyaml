    \    from NWG/RFC #36\n   The proposed protocol does not allow for the possible\
    \ multiplexing of\n   connections over links.\n   Generally, this presents no\
    \ problem, but it might cause loading\n   restrictions in the future. Two cases\
    \ where routing multiple\n   connections over the same link are apparent:\n  \
    \       a) Where a user has several high speed connections, such as\n        \
    \    between processes that transmit files over the network.\n            Assigning\
    \ these connections to the same link limits the\n            percentage of network\
    \ resources that may be used by that\n            user. This becomes particularly\
    \ important when several\n            store-and-forward IMP's are used by the\
    \ network to effect\n            the communication.\n         b) When two hosts\
    \ each have their own independent network and\n            desire to allow access\
    \ to the other hosts's network over\n            the ARPA net, a shortage of links\
    \ may develop. Again, the\n            assignment of several connections to the\
    \ same link could\n            help solve the problem.\n   The following changes\
    \ in the protocol would make possible the future\n   use of multiplexed links.\
    \ It is not necessary to add the\n   multiplexing, itself, to the protocol at\
    \ this time.\n         a) The END and RDY must specify relevant sockets in addition\
    \ to\n            the link number. Only the local socket name need be\n      \
    \      supplied.\n         b) Problems arise with the RSM and SPD commands. Should\
    \ they\n            refer to an entire link, or just to a given connection?\n\
    \            Since there is a proposal to modify the RFNM to accommodate\n   \
    \         these commands, it might be better to add another set of\n         \
    \   commands to block and unblock a connection, but I am not\n            convinced\
    \ that that is the best solution.\n         c) The destintation socket must be\
    \ added to the header of each\n            message on the data link. Presumably\
    \ this would consist of\n            32 bits immediately after the header and\
    \ before the marking.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for\
    \ entry ]\n         [ into the online RFC archives by Karl Reinsch 1/97 ]\n"
