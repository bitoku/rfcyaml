  - "Section 2.\n   The IAB shall consist of a number of members not to exceed 15.\n\
    \   Members of the IAB shall serve in that capacity as individuals, and\n   not\
    \ as representatives of any company, agency, or other organization.\n   Individuals\
    \ shall be nominated for membership by:\n      (a) the IAB;\n      (b) the President\
    \ of the Internet Society;\n      (c) the Board of Trustees of the Internet Society;\
    \  or\n      (d) a duly executed petition of at least 1% of the current\n    \
    \      membership of the Internet Society, or, if the current\n          membership\
    \ of the Society exceeds 15,000, of at least 150\n          members, delivered\
    \ to and validated by the Secretary of\n          the Society.\n   The Internet\
    \ Society Board of Trustees shall approve or disapprove\n   such a nomination\
    \ within 60 days.  Approval shall be by the\n   affirmative vote of at least three-fifths\
    \ of the members of the Board\n   of Trustees then in office.\n   Any member of\
    \ the IAB may be replaced by the Board of Trustees, by\n   the affirmative vote\
    \ of at least four-fifths of the members of the\n   Board of Trustees then in\
    \ office, whenever in their judgement the\n   best interests of the Society will\
    \ be served thereby.  A member of\n   the IAB shall also be replaced, upon the\
    \ confirming vote of a\n   majority of the members of the Board of Trustees then\
    \ in office, if\n   and when a duly executed petition of at least 5% of the voting\n\
    \   membership of the Internet Society is delivered to and validated by\n   the\
    \ Secretary of the Society.  The vote of the Board of Trustees, and\n   any action\
    \ pursuant to that vote, shall be taken no later than at the\n   next regularly\
    \ scheduled meeting of the Board following the date on\n   which the Secretary\
    \ declares the receipt of a valid petition.\n   The Board of Trustees shall review\
    \ each IAB member's contribution to\n   the IAB at three-year intervals, and shall\
    \ at that time explicitly\n   reaffirm or revoke the membership.  There is no\
    \ limit to the number\n   of times the Board of Trustees may reaffirm the membership\
    \ of any\n   individual IAB member.  However, it is expected that the decision\
    \ to\n   reaffirm or revoke will be reached with respect to the current\n   composition\
    \ of the IAB as a whole, and the extent to which the goals\n   and requirements\
    \ of the Internet Society are served by the IAB as\n   then currently constituted.\n\
    \   Whenever the Board of Trustees determines that a vacancy exists on\n   the\
    \ IAB, it shall circulate among the membership of the Internet\n   Society, by\
    \ electronic mail, a call for nominations, specifying a\n   closing date for nominations\
    \ to be received by the Secretary of the\n   Society that is no less than 30 days\
    \ after the date on which the call\n   is circulated.  At its discretion, the\
    \ Board may also circulate the\n   call for nominations among the membership of\
    \ the Society my means\n   other than electronic mail, and may also advertise\
    \ or circulate the\n   call by such other means and among the members of such\
    \ other groups\n   as it sees fit and appropriate.\n"

    \ a\n        member of the IAB or one of its corollary organizations,\n      \
    \  if he or she determines that reimbursement of specific\n        expenses is\

    \        Society, the Board of Trustees may approve the payment of\n        compensation\
    \ to an individual whose service as a member of the\n        IAB or of one of\
    \ its corollary organizations is\n        (1) considered by the Board to be essential\
    \ to the welfare of\n            the Society, and\n        (2) is, in the Board's\
    \ estimation, unobtainable in the absence\n            of reasonable compensation.\n\
    \        In determining the need for and amount of compensation, the\n       \
    \ Board shall apply the criteria and voting rules that it normally\n        applies\
