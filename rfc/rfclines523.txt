SURVEY is in Operation Again The purpose of this message is to inform the network community that the survey program at MIT DMCG computer system is in operation now.
We are surveying hosts every 20 minutes instead of the earlier 15 minutes.
It appears that some sites had problems with incomplete ICP's when survey first came up.
The problem has definitely been fixed now.
Please let me know (tel 617 253 1428 or 253 1449) if any site is being inconvenienced by the survey program.
Upon written request I will be willing to not survey a particular server site.
Upon oral or written request, I will add sites who wish to be surveyed but are not surveyed.
The sites currently being surveyed are (host number in decimal): 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,11,13,14,15,16,23,31,32,35,65,66,69,70,74,78,86,133, 134,138,198.
We issue an RFC to socket1 and now go though the complete ICP, ie establish telnet connections and then close them.
The time for response is now the time to establish the telnet connections, so if your response time shows a larger number don't be alarmed (I think the new numbers are more meaningful and reflect the situation more accurately.)
We are also providing a NETSTATUS service on socket 15.
Where first item is month, day, year, hour, minute and then is a list of host numbers, code, response time in tenths of second.
The list ends with a minus 1, and we close the connections right after sending data
(The service is designed so that both human users and programs can use the data ).
You can of course log into dmcg and use our NETWRK subsystem which has commands for displaying the survey data in many formats (Ref.
We are also recording this data on the DATACOMPUTER (CCA).
Your comments and suggestions will be appreciated.
