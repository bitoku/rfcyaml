  - "1.  Introduction\n   IODEF extensions via class extension through AdditionalData\
    \ and\n   RecordItem elements, per Section 5.2 of [RFC5070], generally register\n\
    \   their namespaces and schemas with the IANA XML Namespace registry at\n   http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/ns.html\
    \ and the IANA XML\n   Schema registry at\n   http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/schema.html,\n\
    \   respectively [RFC3688].\n   In addition to schema reviews required by IANA,\
    \ these registry\n   requests should be accompanied by a review by IODEF experts\
    \ to ensure\n   the specified AdditionalData and/or RecordItem contents are\n\
    \   compatible with IODEF and with other existing IODEF extensions.  This\n  \
    \ document specifies that review.\n"
