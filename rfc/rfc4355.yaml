  - "1.  Introduction\n   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC 3761 [2]) is a system that\
    \ transforms\n   E.164 numbers [3] into domain names and then uses DNS (Domain\
    \ Name\n   Service, RFC 1034 [4]) services like delegation through NS records\n\
    \   and NAPTR records to look up what services are available for a\n   specific\
    \ domain name.\n   This document registers Enumservices according to the guidelines\n\
    \   given in RFC 3761 to be used for provisioning in the services field\n   of\
    \ a NAPTR [5] resource record to indicate what class of\n   functionality a given\
    \ endpoint offers.  The registration is defined\n   within the DDDS (Dynamic Delegation\
    \ Discovery System [6][7][5][8][9])\n   hierarchy, for use with the \"E2U\" DDDS\
    \ Application defined in RFC\n   3761.\n   The following Enumservices are registered\
    \ with this document:\n   \"email\", \"fax\", \"sms\", \"ems\", and \"mms\". \
    \ These share a common\n   feature in that they each indicate that the functionality\
    \ of the\n   given endpoints and the associated resources are capable of receiving\n\
    \   discrete messages, albeit of different types.\n   According to RFC 3761, the\
    \ Enumservice registered must be able to\n   function as a selection mechanism\
    \ when choosing one NAPTR resource\n   record from another.  That means that the\
    \ registration MUST specify\n   what is expected when using that very NAPTR record,\
    \ and the Uniform\n   Resource Identifier (URI) scheme that is the outcome of\
    \ the use of\n   it.\n   Therefore, an Enumservice acts as a hint, indicating\
    \ the kind of\n   service with which the URI constructed using the regexp field\
    \ is\n   associated.  There can be more than one Enumservice included within a\n\
    \   single NAPTR; this indicates that there is more than one service that\n  \
    \ can be achieved using the associated URI scheme.\n   The common thread with\
    \ this set of definitions is that they reflect\n   the kind of service that the\
    \ end-user will hope to achieve with the\n   communication using the associated\
    \ URI.\n   The services specified here are intended not to specify the protocol\n\
    \   or even method of connection that must be used to achieve each\n   service.\
    \  Instead they define the kind of interactive behaviour that\n   an end-user\
    \ will expect, leaving the end system to decide (based on\n   policies outside\
    \ the remit of this specification) how to execute the\n   service.\n   Since the\
    \ same URI scheme may be used for different services (e.g.,\n   'tel:'), and the\
    \ same kind of service may use different URI schemes\n   (e.g., for VoIP 'h323:'\
    \ and 'tel:' may be used), it is necessary in\n   some cases to specify the service\
    \ and the URI scheme used.\n   The service parameters defined in RFC 3761 allow,\
    \ therefore, a \"type\"\n   and a \"subtype\" to be specified.  Within this set\
    \ of specifications,\n   the convention is assumed that the \"type\" (being the\
    \ more generic\n   term) defines the service and the \"subtype\" defines the URI\
    \ scheme.\n   Even where currently only one URI scheme is associated with a given\n\
    \   service, it should be considered that an additional URI scheme to be\n   used\
    \ with this service may be added later.  Thus, the subtype is\n   needed to identify\
    \ the specific Enumservice intended.\n   In this document, there are two URI schemes\
    \ that are used within the\n   various services.  These are 'tel:', as specified\
    \ in RFC 3966 [10]\n   and 'mailto:', as specified in RFC 2368 [11].\n"

  - "5.1.  Introduction\n   An ENUM NAPTR indicates ability on the part of the Subscriber\
    \ to\n   receive specified communication service (or services) provided via\n\
    \   the contact address (shown in the generated URI).\n   In the case of MMS,\
    \ EMS, and SMS services, the capability of these\n   services is a nested superset;\
    \ thus, a service supporting MMS can\n   support also delivery of EMS or SMS message\
    \ content to a recipient\n   that is receiving a Multimedia Message, whilst a\
    \ service supporting\n   EMS can also deliver SMS message content to a recipient\
    \ that can\n   accept receipt of EMS Messages.\n   Thus, even if a client wants\
    \ only to generate and send content that\n   could be carried in an SMS message,\
    \ the client MAY choose to consider\n   also NAPTRs holding EMS and/or MMS Enumservices,\
    \ as these indicate\n   that the destination can accept EMS and/or MMS messages.\
    \  These\n   services will be able to deliver SMS content to the recipient\n \
    \  address.\n   Conversely, a client capable of sending MMS messages may choose\
    \ to\n   consider also NAPTRs indicating support for EMS or SMS messages\n   (assuming\
    \ that the network to which it is connected provides these\n   services as well,\
    \ or is capable of providing a gateway to systems\n   that do provide these services).\
    \  In taking this choice, it would\n   have to \"downgrade\" its User Interface\
    \ to allow only generation of\n   content that conforms to SMS or EMS standards.\n\
    \   These behaviours on the part of the client are purely optional and\n   are\
    \ NOT the subject of any protocol standardisation.\n"

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   DNS, as used by ENUM, is a global, distributed\
    \ database.  Thus, any\n   information stored there is visible to anyone anonymously.\
    \  Whilst\n   this is not qualitatively different from publication in a Telephone\n\
    \   Directory, it does open data subjects to having \"their\" information\n  \
    \ collected automatically without any indication that this has been\n   done or\
    \ by whom.\n   Such data harvesting by third parties is often used to generate\
    \ lists\n   of targets for unrequested information; in short, they are used to\n\
    \   address \"spam\".  Anyone who uses a Web-archived mailing list is aware\n\
    \   that the volume of \"spam\" email they are sent increases when they\n   post\
    \ to the mailing list.  Publication of a telephone number in ENUM\n   is no different,\
    \ and may be used to send \"junk faxes\" or \"junk SMS\",\n   for example.\n \
    \  Many mailing list users have more than one email address and use\n   \"sacrificial\"\
    \ email accounts when posting to such lists to help\n   filter out unrequested\
    \ emails sent to them.  This is not so easy with\n   published telephone numbers;\
    \ the PSTN E.164 number assignment process\n   is much more involved, and usually\
    \ a single E.164 number (or a fixed\n   range of numbers) is associated with each\
    \ PSTN access.  Thus,\n   providing a \"sacrificial\" phone number in any publication\
    \ is not\n   possible.\n   Due to the implications of publishing data on a globally\
    \ accessible\n   database, as a principle, data subjects MUST give their explicit\n\
    \   informed consent to data being published in ENUM.\n   In addition, they should\
    \ be made aware that, due to storage of such\n   data during harvesting by third\
    \ parties, removal of the data from\n   publication will not remove any copies\
    \ that have been taken; in\n   effect, any publication may be permanent.\n   However,\
    \ regulations in many regions will require that data subjects\n   can at any time\
    \ request that the data is removed from publication and\n   that their consent\
    \ for its publication is explicitly confirmed at\n   regular intervals.\n   When\
    \ placing a fax call via the PSTN or a sending a message via the\n   Public Land\
    \ Mobile Network, the sender may be charged for this\n   action.  In both kinds\
    \ of network, calling or messaging to some\n   numbers is more expensive than\
    \ sending to others; both networks have\n   \"premium rate\" services that can\
    \ charge considerably more than a\n   \"normal\" call or message destination.\
    \  As such, it is important that\n   end-users be asked to confirm sending the\
    \ message and that the\n   destination number be presented to them.  It is the\
    \ originating\n   user's choice on whether or not to send a message to this destination\n\
    \   number, but end-users SHOULD be shown the destination number so that\n   they\
    \ can make this decision.\n   Although a fax number, like other E.164 numbers,\
    \ doesn't appear to\n   reveal as much identity information about a user as a\
    \ name in the\n   format user@host (e.g., an email or SIP address), the information\
    \ is\n   still publicly available; thus, there is still the risk of unwanted\n\
    \   communication.\n   An analysis of threats specific to the dependence of ENUM\
    \ on the DNS,\n   and the applicability of DNSSEC [18] to these, is provided in\
    \ RFC\n   3761 [2].  A thorough analysis of threats to the DNS itself is\n   covered\
    \ in RFC 3833 [19].\n   An email address is a canonical address by which a user\
    \ is known.\n   Placing this address in ENUM is comparable to placing a SIP or\
    \ H.323\n   address in the DNS.\n   DNS does not make any policy decisions about\
    \ the records that it\n   shares with an inquirer.  All DNS records must be assumed\
    \ to be\n   available to all inquirers at all times.  The information provided\n\
    \   within an ENUM NAPTR resource record must, therefore, be considered\n   to\
    \ be open to the public, which is a cause for some privacy\n   considerations.\n\
    \   Therefore, ENUM Subscribers should be made aware of this risk.  Since\n  \
    \ it is within the responsibility of the ENUM Subscriber which data is\n   entered\
    \ in ENUM, it is within the ENUM Subscriber's control if he\n   enters email addresses:\n\
    \   1.  allowing inference of private data, e.g., his first and last name\n  \
    \ 2.  at all\n   It should also be considered that it is the purpose of public\n\
    \   communication identifiers to be publicly known.  To reduce spam and\n   other\
    \ unwanted communication, other means should be made available,\n   such as incoming\
    \ message filtering.\n   Some Value Added Service Providers use receipt of a short\
    \ message to\n   a given special service telephone number as a trigger to start\n\
    \   delivery of data messages to the calling number.  By sending an SMS\n   (or,\
    \ in principle, an EMS or MMS) to one of these special service\n   numbers, one\
    \ is entering into a contract to pay for receipt of a set\n   of messages containing\
    \ information (e.g., news, sports results, \"ring\n   tones\").\n   Thus, it is\
    \ very important that the end terminal presents the\n   destination number to\
    \ which any message is to be sent using the \"sms:\n   tel\", \"ems:tel\", or\
    \ \"mms:tel\" Enumservices, to allow the end-user to\n   cancel any message before\
    \ it is sent to one of these numbers.\n   At present, these systems use the circuit\
    \ switched network trusted\n   calling line identifier to identify the destination\
    \ for the\n   subsequent charged information messages, and so it is believed that\n\
    \   sending using the \"sms:mailto\", \"ems:mailto\", or \"mms:mailto\"\n   Enumservices\
    \ does not have this risk currently.\n"
