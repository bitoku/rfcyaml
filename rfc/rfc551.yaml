    \        Several Atomic Energy Commission installations are planning to\n   enter\
    \ the network in the (hopefully) near future.  These sites\n   include Argonne\
    \ National Laboratory (IBM 360/195), Lawrence Berkeley\n   Labs, (CDC 7600), and\
    \ New York University (CDC 6600).  Our\n   applications make early implementation\
    \ of an RJE facility imperative,\n   and although we are resigned to the necessity\
    \ of implementing FTP, we\n   would like to avoid RJE protocol at least in the\
    \ first go-around.  We\n   would like to be able to use FTP to transfer a file,\
    \ have it queued\n   for execution, and return output and status information.\n\
    \        To this end we propose to implement local conventions within the\n  \
    \ site dependent PATHNAME parameter of the FTP.  Specifically, the\n   following\
    \ commands are specified:\nSTOR           RJE.JOB<rest of pathname>  queue this\
    \ file for execution\n(STOR/RETR)    RJE.PR <    >              transfer remote\
    \ job print file\n(STOR/RETR)    RJE.PU <    >                 \"        \"  \
    \  \"  punch   \"\n(STOR/RETR)    RJE.MT <    >                 \"        \" \
    \   \"  magtape \"\nRETR           RJE.STAT  <    >           retrieve  status\
    \ of remote job\n        The job execution parameters are not part of the protocol,\
    \ but\n   must be specified in the standard site dependent control cards which\n\
    \   are transmitted with the file.  These parameters also determine the\n   output\
    \ disposition, and the output can be retrieved by the user via\n   RETR, or (optionally)\
    \ automatically by server initiation via STOR.*\n   The RETR RJE.STAT causes the\
    \ server to create a file with the status\n   information and transfer it to the\
    \ user.  The FTP user/acct/pass\n   logon is used only to validate the data transfer,\
    \ not the job's right\n   to execute, and to identify and distribute the output.\n\
    \        We are concerned that we may have overlooked some problems which\n  \
    \ are obvious to more knowledgeable people and invite (and request)\n   comments.\n\
    \   *  note that in this case the RJE server is an FTP user.\n         [ This\
    \ RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n         [   into the online\
