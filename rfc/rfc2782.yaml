  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a DNS RR which specifies the location of\
    \ the\n   server(s) for a specific protocol and domain.\n"
- title: Overview and rationale
  contents:
  - "Overview and rationale\n   Currently, one must either know the exact address\
    \ of a server to\n   contact it, or broadcast a question.\n   The SRV RR allows\
    \ administrators to use several servers for a single\n   domain, to move services\
    \ from host to host with little fuss, and to\n   designate some hosts as primary\
    \ servers for a service and others as\n   backups.\n   Clients ask for a specific\
    \ service/protocol for a specific domain\n   (the word domain is used here in\
    \ the strict RFC 1034 sense), and get\n   back the names of any available servers.\n\
    \   Note that where this document refers to \"address records\", it means A\n\
    \   RR's, AAAA RR's, or their most modern equivalent.\n"
- title: Definitions
  contents:
  - "Definitions\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\"\
    \ and \"MAY\"\n   used in this document are to be interpreted as specified in\
    \ [BCP 14].\n   Other terms used in this document are defined in the DNS\n   specification,\
    \ RFC 1034.\n"
- title: Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "Applicability Statement\n   In general, it is expected that SRV records will\
    \ be used by clients\n   for applications where the relevant protocol specification\
    \ indicates\n   that clients should use the SRV record. Such specification MUST\n\
    \   define the symbolic name to be used in the Service field of the SRV\n   record\
    \ as described below. It also MUST include security\n   considerations. Service\
    \ SRV records SHOULD NOT be used in the absence\n   of such specification.\n"
- title: Introductory example
  contents:
  - "Introductory example\n   If a SRV-cognizant LDAP client wants to discover a LDAP\
    \ server that\n   supports TCP protocol and provides LDAP service for the domain\n\
    \   example.com., it does a lookup of\n      _ldap._tcp.example.com\n   as described\
    \ in [ARM].  The example zone file near the end of this\n   memo contains answering\
    \ RRs for an SRV query.\n   Note: LDAP is chosen as an example for illustrative\
    \ purposes only,\n   and the LDAP examples used in this document should not be\
    \ considered\n   a definitive statement on the recommended way for LDAP to use\
    \ SRV\n   records. As described in the earlier applicability section, consult\n\
    \   the appropriate LDAP documents for the recommended procedures.\n"
- title: The format of the SRV RR
  contents:
  - "The format of the SRV RR\n   Here is the format of the SRV RR, whose DNS type\
    \ code is 33:\n        _Service._Proto.Name TTL Class SRV Priority Weight Port\
    \ Target\n        (There is an example near the end of this document.)\n   Service\n\
    \        The symbolic name of the desired service, as defined in Assigned\n  \
    \      Numbers [STD 2] or locally.  An underscore (_) is prepended to\n      \
    \  the service identifier to avoid collisions with DNS labels that\n        occur\
    \ in nature.\n        Some widely used services, notably POP, don't have a single\n\
    \        universal name.  If Assigned Numbers names the service\n        indicated,\
    \ that name is the only name which is legal for SRV\n        lookups.  The Service\
    \ is case insensitive.\n   Proto\n        The symbolic name of the desired protocol,\
    \ with an underscore\n        (_) prepended to prevent collisions with DNS labels\
    \ that occur\n        in nature.  _TCP and _UDP are at present the most useful\
    \ values\n        for this field, though any name defined by Assigned Numbers\
    \ or\n        locally may be used (as for Service).  The Proto is case\n     \
    \   insensitive.\n   Name\n        The domain this RR refers to.  The SRV RR is\
    \ unique in that the\n        name one searches for is not this name; the example\
    \ near the end\n        shows this clearly.\n   TTL\n        Standard DNS meaning\
    \ [RFC 1035].\n   Class\n        Standard DNS meaning [RFC 1035].   SRV records\
    \ occur in the IN\n        Class.\n   Priority\n        The priority of this target\
    \ host.  A client MUST attempt to\n        contact the target host with the lowest-numbered\
    \ priority it can\n        reach; target hosts with the same priority SHOULD be\
    \ tried in an\n        order defined by the weight field.  The range is 0-65535.\
    \  This\n        is a 16 bit unsigned integer in network byte order.\n   Weight\n\
    \        A server selection mechanism.  The weight field specifies a\n       \
    \ relative weight for entries with the same priority. Larger\n        weights\
    \ SHOULD be given a proportionately higher probability of\n        being selected.\
    \ The range of this number is 0-65535.  This is a\n        16 bit unsigned integer\
    \ in network byte order.  Domain\n        administrators SHOULD use Weight 0 when\
    \ there isn't any server\n        selection to do, to make the RR easier to read\
    \ for humans (less\n        noisy).  In the presence of records containing weights\
    \ greater\n        than 0, records with weight 0 should have a very small chance\
    \ of\n        being selected.\n        In the absence of a protocol whose specification\
    \ calls for the\n        use of other weighting information, a client arranges\
    \ the SRV\n        RRs of the same Priority in the order in which target hosts,\n\
    \        specified by the SRV RRs, will be contacted. The following\n        algorithm\
    \ SHOULD be used to order the SRV RRs of the same\n        priority:\n       \
    \ To select a target to be contacted next, arrange all SRV RRs\n        (that\
    \ have not been ordered yet) in any order, except that all\n        those with\
    \ weight 0 are placed at the beginning of the list.\n        Compute the sum of\
    \ the weights of those RRs, and with each RR\n        associate the running sum\
    \ in the selected order. Then choose a\n        uniform random number between\
    \ 0 and the sum computed\n        (inclusive), and select the RR whose running\
    \ sum value is the\n        first in the selected order which is greater than\
    \ or equal to\n        the random number selected. The target host specified in\
    \ the\n        selected SRV RR is the next one to be contacted by the client.\n\
    \        Remove this SRV RR from the set of the unordered SRV RRs and\n      \
    \  apply the described algorithm to the unordered SRV RRs to select\n        the\
    \ next target host.  Continue the ordering process until there\n        are no\
    \ unordered SRV RRs.  This process is repeated for each\n        Priority.\n \
    \  Port\n        The port on this target host of this service.  The range is 0-\n\
    \        65535.  This is a 16 bit unsigned integer in network byte order.\n  \
    \      This is often as specified in Assigned Numbers but need not be.\n   Target\n\
    \        The domain name of the target host.  There MUST be one or more\n    \
    \    address records for this name, the name MUST NOT be an alias (in\n      \
    \  the sense of RFC 1034 or RFC 2181).  Implementors are urged, but\n        not\
    \ required, to return the address record(s) in the Additional\n        Data section.\
    \  Unless and until permitted by future standards\n        action, name compression\
    \ is not to be used for this field.\n        A Target of \".\" means that the\
    \ service is decidedly not\n        available at this domain.\n"
- title: Domain administrator advice
  contents:
  - "Domain administrator advice\n   Expecting everyone to update their client applications\
    \ when the first\n   server publishes a SRV RR is futile (even if desirable).\
    \  Therefore\n   SRV would have to coexist with address record lookups for existing\n\
    \   protocols, and DNS administrators should try to provide address\n   records\
    \ to support old clients:\n      - Where the services for a single domain are\
    \ spread over several\n        hosts, it seems advisable to have a list of address\
    \ records at\n        the same DNS node as the SRV RR, listing reasonable (if\
    \ perhaps\n        suboptimal) fallback hosts for Telnet, NNTP and other protocols\n\
    \        likely to be used with this name.  Note that some programs only\n   \
    \     try the first address they get back from e.g. gethostbyname(),\n       \
    \ and we don't know how widespread this behavior is.\n      - Where one service\
    \ is provided by several hosts, one can either\n        provide address records\
    \ for all the hosts (in which case the\n        round-robin mechanism, where available,\
    \ will share the load\n        equally) or just for one (presumably the fastest).\n\
    \      - If a host is intended to provide a service only when the main\n     \
    \   server(s) is/are down, it probably shouldn't be listed in\n        address\
    \ records.\n      - Hosts that are referenced by backup address records must use\
    \ the\n        port number specified in Assigned Numbers for the service.\n  \
    \    - Designers of future protocols for which \"secondary servers\" is\n    \
    \    not useful (or meaningful) may choose to not use SRV's support\n        for\
    \ secondary servers.  Clients for such protocols may use or\n        ignore SRV\
    \ RRs with Priority higher than the RR with the lowest\n        Priority for a\
    \ domain.\n   Currently there's a practical limit of 512 bytes for DNS replies.\n\
    \   Until all resolvers can handle larger responses, domain\n   administrators\
    \ are strongly advised to keep their SRV replies below\n   512 bytes.\n   All\
    \ round numbers, wrote Dr. Johnson, are false, and these numbers\n   are very\
    \ round: A reply packet has a 30-byte overhead plus the name\n   of the service\
    \ (\"_ldap._tcp.example.com\" for instance); each SRV RR\n   adds 20 bytes plus\
    \ the name of the target host; each NS RR in the NS\n   section is 15 bytes plus\
    \ the name of the name server host; and\n   finally each A RR in the additional\
    \ data section is 20 bytes or so,\n   and there are A's for each SRV and NS RR\
    \ mentioned in the answer.\n   This size estimate is extremely crude, but shouldn't\
    \ underestimate\n   the actual answer size by much.  If an answer may be close\
    \ to the\n   limit, using a DNS query tool (e.g. \"dig\") to look at the actual\n\
    \   answer is a good idea.\n"
- title: The "Weight" field
  contents:
  - "The \"Weight\" field\n   Weight, the server selection field, is not quite satisfactory,\
    \ but\n   the actual load on typical servers changes much too quickly to be\n\
    \   kept around in DNS caches.  It seems to the authors that offering\n   administrators\
    \ a way to say \"this machine is three times as fast as\n   that one\" is the\
    \ best that can practically be done.\n   The only way the authors can see of getting\
    \ a \"better\" load figure is\n   asking a separate server when the client selects\
    \ a server and\n   contacts it.  For short-lived services an extra step in the\n\
    \   connection establishment seems too expensive, and for long-lived\n   services,\
    \ the load figure may well be thrown off a minute after the\n   connection is\
    \ established when someone else starts or finishes a\n   heavy job.\n   Note:\
    \ There are currently various experiments at providing relative\n   network proximity\
    \ estimation, available bandwidth estimation, and\n   similar services.  Use of\
    \ the SRV record with such facilities, and in\n   particular the interpretation\
    \ of the Weight field when these\n   facilities are used, is for further study.\
    \  Weight is only intended\n   for static, not dynamic, server selection.  Using\
    \ SRV weight for\n   dynamic server selection would require assigning unreasonably\
    \ short\n   TTLs to the SRV RRs, which would limit the usefulness of the DNS\n\
    \   caching mechanism, thus increasing overall network load and\n   decreasing\
    \ overall reliability.  Server selection via SRV is only\n   intended to express\
    \ static information such as \"this server has a\n   faster CPU than that one\"\
    \ or \"this server has a much better network\n   connection than that one\".\n"
- title: The Port number
  contents:
  - "The Port number\n   Currently, the translation from service name to port number\
    \ happens\n   at the client, often using a file such as /etc/services.\n   Moving\
    \ this information to the DNS makes it less necessary to update\n   these files\
    \ on every single computer of the net every time a new\n   service is added, and\
    \ makes it possible to move standard services out\n   of the \"root-only\" port\

  - "Security Considerations\n   The authors believe this RR to not cause any new\
    \ security problems.\n   Some problems become more visible, though.\n   - The\
    \ ability to specify ports on a fine-grained basis obviously\n     changes how\
    \ a router can filter packets.  It becomes impossible\n     to block internal\
    \ clients from accessing specific external\n     services, slightly harder to\
    \ block internal users from running\n     unauthorized services, and more important\
    \ for the router\n     operations and DNS operations personnel to cooperate.\n\
    \   - There is no way a site can keep its hosts from being referenced\n     as\
    \ servers.  This could lead to denial of service.\n   - With SRV, DNS spoofers\
    \ can supply false port numbers, as well as\n     host names and addresses.  \
    \ Because this vulnerability exists\n     already, with names and addresses, this\
    \ is not a new\n     vulnerability, merely a slightly extended one, with little\n\
    \     practical effect.\n"
