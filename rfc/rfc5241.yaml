  - "Abstract\n   This document proposes a new revenue source for the IETF to support\n\
    \   standardization activities: protocol field naming rights, i.e., the\n   association\
    \ of commercial brands with protocol fields.  This memo\n   describes a process\
    \ for assignment of rights and explores some of the\n   issues associated with\
    \ the process.  Individuals or organizations\n   that wish to purchase naming\
    \ rights for one or more protocol fields\n   are expected to follow this process.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Normal engineering practice involves assigning names to\
    \ fields in\n   network protocols.  These names are generally carefully chosen\
    \ to\n   reflect the function of the field, for example, the IPv4 Destination\n\
    \   Address field.\n   As protocol designers engage in their work, many become\
    \ intensely\n   involved with these protocol fields.  Some of the most intense\n\
    \   discussions within the IETF have been over details about such fields.\n  \
    \ In fact, it is an advantage to the continued viability of the IETF\n   that\
    \ dueling is outlawed in the countries in which it meets.\n   But the financial\
    \ realities of funding the Internet engineering and\n   standardization processes\
    \ may dictate that the IETF must consider\n   whether names associated with such\
    \ protocol fields represent an asset\n   capable of responsible monetization.\
    \  This notion may be offensive to\n   some protocol purists; however, we believe\
    \ the exigencies of the\n   situation make the proposal below worthy of consideration.\n\
    \   This document describes a process and some issues associated with\n   managing\
    \ the sale of commercial branding rights (or naming rights)\n   for IETF protocol\
    \ fields.  The authors believe that this modest\n   proposal may serve as a source\
    \ of revenue capable of supporting IETF\n   standardization activities for years\
    \ to come.\n   This proposal arose from the realization that the sports industry\
    \ has\n   made energetic and successful use of naming rights, for stadiums in\n\
    \   particular, e.g., the Staples Center in Los Angeles (basketball),\n   Qualcomm\
    \ Stadium in San Diego (football), Minute Maid Park in Houston\n   (baseball),\
    \ and the Aaron's \"Lucky Dog\" get-a-lap-back (car racing).\n   The Internet\
    \ has enabled a new online economy that, even in the wake\n   of the burst bubble\
    \ in early 2000, is generating astounding growth\n   and new services.  It is\
    \ clear that many old-economy companies would\n   place high value on being associated\
    \ with the new online economy and\n   would be willing to pay for the privilege.\
    \  Internet protocols are\n   used around the world in myriad operating systems\
    \ and devices.  To be\n   part of the Internet protocols is to be part of the\
    \ engine that is\n   revolutionizing how commerce is done.  Many protocol fields\
    \ are\n   displayed in popular user applications either as key aspects of the\n\
    \   GUI or in error or diagnostic messages.  By requiring the use of the\n   branded\
    \ protocol field, the IETF is in a position to put client\n   company brands in\
    \ front of not only the thousands of software\n   developers who build with these\
    \ protocols but also the hundreds of\n   millions of users who benefit from them.\
    \  Finally, those who license\n   and brand a protocol field will be able to use\
    \ that field in their\n   other marketing and claim, truthfully, that they are\
    \ \"in the\n   network\".\n   This proposal includes creating a primary name value\
    \ for each\n   protocol field in the IANA registry and setting up a process whereby\n\
    \   an organization or an individual can license the right to record a\n   name\
    \ of their choice in that field.\n   This document makes the case for the need\
    \ for additional revenue for\n   the IETF (Section 2), followed by an introduction\
    \ of the concept of\n   branding in IETF protocols (Section 3).  Several rules\
    \ and\n   constraints necessary to make such a revenue stream practical are\n\
    \   then explored (Sections 4-14).  Finally, this memo concludes with an\n   initial\
    \ assessment of the changes required by the IANA and RFC Editor\n   to support\
    \ such a service (Sections 15-17).\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"\
    REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    ,  \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Revenue Needs
  contents:
  - "2.  Revenue Needs\n   Running the IETF is not inexpensive.  It was reported at\
    \ the 71st\n   IETF meeting in Philadelphia, PA, USA that the 2008 budget [BUDGET]\n\
    \   for the IETF had surpassed US$4.5 M, up from $4.1 M in 2007.  About\n   US$3\
    \ M of revenue in this budget flows directly from IETF activities,\n   including\
    \ meeting fees and sponsorships, and the remainder flows from\n   the Internet\
    \ Society (ISOC).  Over the last few years the IETF has\n   had to raise meeting\
    \ fees repeatedly in order to keep this budget\n   balance reasonable.\n   Raising\
    \ an additional US$1 M from the rental of naming rights could\n   significantly\
    \ change the budget dynamics.  Perhaps meeting fees could\n   be reduced for all\
    \ attendees or special subsidies could be provided\n   to needy students, researchers,\
    \ or job seekers.  Other options for\n   the use of the increased revenue could\
    \ be sizing the break cookies\n   large enough to feed a family of geeks for a\
    \ week rather than the\n   mere day and a half as was the case at the 71st IETF,\
    \ or renting out\n   a bar for the working group chairs social rather than having\
    \ to put\n   up with the rowdy locals.  There are many other equally deserving\n\
    \   ways that the IETF could spend the resources generated by this\n   proposal.\
    \  It should be noted that any such benefits may have to be\n   delayed for a\
    \ few years to pay for the startup costs noted below.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Within the IETF
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Within the IETF\n   When a protocol field name is licensed from the IETF,\
    \ all future IETF\n   activities, and documentation for products claiming to conform\
    \ to\n   IETF standards, MUST use the complete branded name.  The output from\n\
    \   protocol implementations, and associated documentation, MUST be\n   considered\
    \ non-conformant if the complete branded name is not used.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Externally
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Externally\n   The official IETF name for a purchased field is the complete\
    \ branded\n   name.  Thus, all externally generated documentation that references\n\
    \   the protocol must be considered incomplete unless it used the\n   complete\
    \ branded name where one exists.  The IETF leaves it to the\n   licensee to enforce\
    \ the use of complete branded names in non-IETF\n   documents.\n"
- title: 4.  Names Must Be in Good Taste
  contents:
  - "4.  Names Must Be in Good Taste\n   The combination of brand names and protocol\
    \ field names must avoid\n   uses that may be considered offensive by some part\
    \ of the Internet\n   community.  Name purchases shall be reviewed for taste.\
    \  Prospective\n   purchasers must prepare a proposal for how the branded protocol\
    \ name\n   will be used in advertising or other media.  (Note that a well-\n \
    \  developed taste-review process may prove useful for other IETF\n   activities,\
    \ for example, IETF working group names, T-shirts, and host\n   presentations.)\n\
    \   Within the limits of taste, the branded protocol field may be used\n   for\
    \ any purpose.\n"
- title: 5.  When Names Change
  contents:
  - "5.  When Names Change\n   As has been discovered in other areas where naming\
    \ rights are sold or\n   leased, commercial realities and developments mean that\
    \ a brand name\n   can suddenly go out of favor or even cease to denote an existing\n\
    \   entity.  In addition, branding is leased (i.e., sold to be used over\n   a\
    \ limited time) and the branding for a particular field may change\n   when the\
    \ lease is up.  Thus, there must be a mechanism to change\n   branding when needed.\
    \  See the IANA Considerations, RFC Editor\n   Considerations, and Tools Considerations\
    \ sections for more\n   information.\n"
- title: 6.  Example Names
  contents:
  - "6.  Example Names\n   The most effective names are those that pair the semantics\
    \ of a field\n   with a characteristic desirable to a sponsor.  The following\
    \ examples\n   of good and bad pairings illustrate how an appropriate pairing\
    \ can be\n   appealing.\n"

- title: 7.  Who Can Buy Naming Rights?
  contents:
  - "7.  Who Can Buy Naming Rights?\n   Any organization or individual can purchase\
    \ the right to brand a\n   protocol field.  The IETF will not undertake to ensure\
    \ that the\n   purchasing organization has the right to use the name they choose\
    \ to\n   use.  All purchasing organizations MUST indemnify the IETF against\n\
    \   any challenges to the authority of the purchasing organization to use\n  \
    \ the name.\n"
- title: 8.  Scope of Naming Applicability
  contents:
  - "8.  Scope of Naming Applicability\n   Because the application of IETF protocols\
    \ is not controlled in a way\n   that corresponds to legal jurisdictions, it is\
    \ difficult to restrict\n   naming rights to include just those places where a\
    \ particular\n   trademark may be registered.  The process described in this memo\
    \ does\n   not include the use of geographic or geopolitical boundaries on the\n\
    \   use of branded fields.  The design team is working on a proposal to\n   overcome\
    \ this issue.  If the design team is successful, the same\n   proposal should\
    \ find application in a number of areas of\n   international diplomacy.\n"
- title: 9.  Who Can Sell Naming Rights?
  contents:
  - "9.  Who Can Sell Naming Rights?\n   The IETF SHALL retain the sole right to permit\
    \ branded protocol names\n   to be used within IETF protocols.  The IETF MAY sell\
    \ rights for\n   external use of branded protocol names if the protocols have\
    \ been\n   developed within the IETF process and if the protocol field has not\n\
    \   already been branded by someone else using the same process.\n"
- title: 10.  Pricing
  contents:
  - "10.  Pricing\n   Multiple pricing strategies for the naming rights to protocol\
    \ fields\n   will likely be used over time.  The primary objective of pricing\
    \ is\n   to enable the greatest possible revenue for the IETF.  Initially,\n \
    \  prices will be set by negotiation between the party wishing to\n   purchase\
    \ the naming right and the Internet Auction Board (IAB)\n   representative.  However,\
    \ we strongly suggest migrating to an all pay\n   auction (also known as a Tullock\
    \ auction) for finding the optimal\n   price when there are multiple bidders [KOVENOCK].\
    \  Alternatively,\n   open-outcry auctions [EKLOR], perhaps with a secret reserve\
    \ price,\n   could be held at IETF meetings using a BoF session, permitting taste\n\
    \   review and brand assignment (sale) to be conducted concurrently and\n   with\
    \ open participation.  See [MILGROM] for information on various\n   auction styles.\n"
- title: 11.  Time of Ownership
  contents:
  - "11.  Time of Ownership\n   The design team could not come to consensus on a default\
    \ term of a\n   lease of the authority to name a protocol field.  It was split\n\
    \   between a term that would best represent the half-life of an Internet\n  \
    \ startup (1 or 2 years) and a term that would best represent the\n   half-life\
    \ of a product offered by a mature Internet company (8 to 10\n   years).  The\
    \ idea of terms any longer than 10 years, for example,\n   leases that would terminate\
    \ when a protocol advanced on the standards\n   track (i.e., roughly infinite),\
    \ was discussed but generally discarded\n   because so few companies survive in\
    \ any recognizable form for that\n   length of time in the Internet space.  In\
    \ the end, the design team\n   concluded that the lease term should be part of\
    \ the negotiation\n   between the IETF and the purchasing organization.\n"
- title: 12.  How Are Naming Rights Purchased?
  contents:
  - "12.  How Are Naming Rights Purchased?\n   The right to name a protocol field\
    \ is purchased using the following\n   process: licensees complete an application\
    \ where they identify the\n   protocol field they wish to use and the particular\
    \ RFC in which it\n   appears (Internet-Draft tags are available for short term\
    \ lease).  At\n   that time, they identify their brand and present their proposal\
    \ for\n   external use and length of ownership.  The next step is a taste\n  \
    \ review followed by an auction or IAB negotiation.  The purchase\n   concludes\
    \ with the IANA updating their protocol field name mapping\n   database.\n"
- title: 13.  Dispute Resolutions
  contents:
  - "13.  Dispute Resolutions\n   All disputes arising from this process MUST be resolved\
    \ using the\n   ICANN Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy [UDRP].  While\n\
    \   the protocol fields are not domain names, branding them presents the\n   same\
    \ types of issues and we feel that it's better to make use of an\n   existing\
    \ process rather than to invent a new one.\n"

- title: 15.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "15.  IANA Considerations\n   Upon the adoption of this proposal the IANA SHALL\
    \ set up a protocol\n   field-to-brand-name database (the \"IETF Protocol Branding\
    \ Catalog\")\n   that includes all protocol fields in IETF-developed or -maintained\n\
    \   protocols.  This database can be bootstrapped from the existing\n   protocol\
    \ registries database [PROTREG], but this list will have to be\n   augmented to\
    \ include all fields in all IETF protocols, even the ones\n   in which no IANA\
    \ assignments are made.\n   The two brand name fields associated with each protocol\
    \ field (the\n   ASCII field and the optional UTF-8 field) are initialized as\
    \ NULL.\n   Whenever the IETF leases a protocol field, the IANA SHALL enter the\n\
    \   brand name(s) into the brand-named fields associated with the\n   protocol\
    \ field and SHALL set the lease termination date to the proper\n   value.\n  \
    \ In addition, the IANA SHALL regularly scan the database to look for\n   leases\
    \ terminating within the next 30 days and inform the IETF of any\n   such leases\
    \ so that the IAB can approach the leaseholder to sign up\n   for an additional\
    \ term.  The IANA SHALL remove any brand names from\n   their database when the\
    \ lease expires.\n"
- title: 16.  RFC Editor Considerations
  contents:
  - "16.  RFC Editor Considerations\n   Upon the adoption of this proposal the RFC\
    \ Editor SHALL create XML\n   versions of all IETF RFCs.  The XML must be such\
    \ that a perfect copy\n   of the original RFC can be produced using a tool such\
    \ as xml2rfc\n   [XML2RFC].  The XML versions of RFCs must identify all individual\n\
    \   protocol fields using an XML protocol field element of the form:\n     <pfield\
    \ name=\"IPv4 Destination Address\"/>\n   (Doing this for all existing RFCs may\
    \ involve some work.)\n   As the XML RFCs are completed, the RFC Editor SHALL\
    \ then create an\n   ASCII version of the RFC from the XML file using the naming\n\
    \   convention of \"Real_RFCxxxx.txt\".  During the translation, each\n   protocol\
    \ field is looked up in the IANA protocol field-to-brand name\n   database.  If\
    \ there is an ASCII brand name associated with the\n   protocol field, the word\
    \ \"the\" and the brand name are prepended to\n   the IETF name for the field\
    \ (unless the name appears in ASCII art\n   where changing the length of the name\
    \ would distort the art).  For\n   example, if the protocol field is \"Destination\
    \ Address\" and the brand\n   name in the IANA database is \"Garmin GPS\", the\
    \ string \"the Garmin GPS\n   Destination Address\" would be used in the Real_RFC.\
    \  Changing the\n   lengths of such names may require adjusting the other details\
    \ of the\n   document such as page numbering in the Table of Contents.  The\n\
    \   software to do some of the formatting might be a bit tricky.\n   The RFC Editor\
    \ may optionally produce other non-normative versions of\n   Real_RFCs.  For example,\
    \ a non-normative Portable Document Format\n   (PDF) version may be created in\
    \ addition to the ASCII Real_RFC\n   version.  The RFC Editor may use the UTF-8\
    \ brand, if present, in such\n   alternate versions.\n   The Real_RFC SHALL be\
    \ used for all normal purposes within the IETF\n   and elsewhere with the original\
    \ version being reserved as an archival\n   reference.\n   The RFC Editor SHALL\
    \ rebuild all the Real_RFCs on a regular basis to\n   create up-to-date Real_RFCs\
    \ that reflect the current status of the\n   protocol field licenses.\n   The\
    \ RFC Editor SHALL provide a list of un-leased field names to the\n   IANA for\
    \ inclusion in the IETF Protocol Branding Catalog.\n"

- title: 19.  Conclusion
  contents:
  - "19.  Conclusion\n   The discussion above has introduced the concept of branding\
    \ IETF\n   protocols and the associated implications.  Clearly there are non-\n\
    \   trivial costs to starting up and maintaining such a revenue stream.\n   However,\
    \ advertising has a long and distinguished history of\n   supporting valuable\
    \ community services such as free broadcast\n   television and Google.\n   As\
    \ branded protocols become established, new protocols will be\n   developed with\
    \ names conducive to branding.  In fact, licensees may\n   initiate new IETF work\
    \ just to see an appropriate field established.\n   So, besides the economic benefits\
    \ to the IETF, this initiative may in\n   fact help ensure the IETF is never without\
    \ work and, thus, self-\n   sustaining and self-perpetuating.\n"
