- title: 1.0  Introduction

  - "1.0  Introduction\n   This paper is a list of the essential things, in my view,\
    \ that a\n   person who is responsible for providing network information should\n\
    \   have in their hands as reference material.  One of the basic problems\n  \
    \ of information is making it easily available to those who have need\n   of the\
    \ data.  Libraries have been performing a cataloging function\n   for many centuries.\
    \  Information flow is now being provided at such a\n   fast rate that it is difficult\
    \ to keep up with it, even partially.\n   Computer networks have only added to\
    \ the problem by opening up even\n   more information.\n   Attempting to make\
    \ this wealth of information available to those who\n   would find it useful poses\
    \ some problems.\n   First, we need to know of its existence.  To that end, this\
    \ paper\n   provides an index into the vast realm of network information. Most\
    \ of\n   the documents listed here are POINTERS to the final information.\n  \
    \ Second, even if you know of a document's existence, you may not know\n   if\
    \ it is important or relevant.  Few of us are knowledgeable in more\n   than a\
    \ limited area.  We need to rely on others to make us aware of\n   the importance\
    \ of databases in a specific discipline. The librarians\n   can be of great assistance\
    \ here.  They are familiar with the research\n   databases that individuals search\
    \ in Law, Mathematics, and many\n   others.\n   Finally, once the existence and\
    \ importance are known, the information\n   needs to be indexed so that researchers\
    \ can find it.  This is the\n   most difficult task to accomplish.  Information\
    \ available on the\n   network is hardly ever static.  It is always moving, growing,\n\
    \   changing, and dying.  Computers should be able to assist us in\n   managing\
    \ this ever-changing environment.  Right now, we have to\n   catalog the information\
    \ as it passes through the network.  In my\n   case, I generally save it in a\
    \ file somewhere, spending far too much\n   time trying to retrieve it again when\
    \ needed.\n"

- title: 12.0  Glossary

  - "12.0  Glossary\n      I use some concepts here that may not be familiar to all.\
    \  The\n      following is a brief explanation of some of the concepts.\n   12.1\
    \  BITNET:\n      A network of normally mini or mainframe computers.  BITNET\n\
    \      connects many universities and colleges together.  It provides\n      e-mail\
    \ and file transfer capabilities.  It does not have the\n      ability to do remote\
    \ login (Telnet sessions).\n   12.2  Internet:\n      A very large network that\
    \ connects just about any type of\n      computer together.  It supports e-mail,\
    \ file transfer (FTP), and\n      remote login (Telnet).\n   12.3  Anonymous FTP:\n\
    \      The ability to transfer a file from a remote computer connected\n     \
    \ to Internet without having an account on the remote computer.\n      The program\
    \ that performs the file transfer is normal FTP.  To\n      connect to a remote\
    \ computer offering anonymous FTP you can use\n      the following commands from\
    \ a computer connected to Internet:\n      FTP Internet computer name\n      When\
    \ prompted for a userid:  type anonymous\n      When prompted for a password type\
    \ your e-mail address\n      To get a listing of files type dir\n      To change\
    \ directory type cd directory name\n      To get a file type get filename\n  \
    \    To get a binary file type binary then get filename\n      To end session\
    \ type quit\n      Example:\n      FTP pilot.njin.net\n      Username:  anonymous\n\
    \      Password:  yourname@computer.edu\n      cd pub/ftp-list\n      get ftp.list\n\
    \      quit\n   12.4  Telnet:\n      The ability to establish a connection to\
    \ a remote computer\n      connected to the Internet network.  There are two types\
    \ of\n      programs that are used to do this.  One, normally referred to as\n\
    \      Telnet, normally establishes a VT100 type terminal emulation to\n     \
    \ the remote computer.  The second, TN3270, establishes a full\n      screen IBM\
    \ 3270 type terminal connection.\n   12.5  Listserv:\n      A program available\
    \ on many BITNET connected computers that can\n      act as a mail forward system\
    \ and as a file repository.  BITNET is\n      another network that links many\
    \ colleges and universities\n      together.  It does not normally link to military\
    \ or government\n      institutions as does the Internet.  To subscribe to a listserv,\n\
    \      you normally send mail to the machine which has the mailing list\n    \
    \  with the command to subscribe.  As an example, to subscribe to a\n      list\
    \ for discussion of topics pertinent to Mechanical Engineering,\n      you would\
    \ send e-mail to listserv@utarlvml with the content of the\n      message containing\
    \ the one line command to subscribe:\n      SUB MECH-1 John Doe  (Where John Doe\
    \ would be your full name)\n      The document \"Interest Groups\" listed below\
    \ contains the list of\n      the majority of these lists that you can subscribe.\n"

  contents:
  - "Disclaimer\n   The information provided in the previous sections has been put\n\
    \   together from multiple sources acquired from the network.  Much of it\n  \
    \ came from reading newsgroups and trying things out to see how they\n   worked.\
    \  The information is as accurate as I have been able to\n   determine, as of\
    \ December 5, 1991.\n   I used a DEC5500 system running Ultrix to check most of\
    \ these\n   sources.  Most of the information is oriented toward Internet, since\n\
    \   it has the ability to remote login (Telnet) and File Transfer (FTP).\n"
