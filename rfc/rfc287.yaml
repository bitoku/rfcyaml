  - "                        Status of Network Hosts\n     This RFC reports on the\
    \ status of most Network Hosts from\nDecember 6 to December 18.  Due to hardware\
    \ debugging, the BBN\nprototype Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) was unavailable\
    \ for most\nof the two weeks from November 22 to December 6. There was, therefore,\n\
    no Host status reports for that period.\n     Several Hosts are currently excluded\
    \ from the daily testing.\nThese Hosts fall into two categories:\n   1) Hosts\
    \ which are not expected to be functioning on\n      the Network as servers (available\
    \ for use from\n      other sites) on a regular basis for at least two\n     \
    \ weeks. Included here are:\n   Network\n   Address              Site        \
    \        Computer\n     133                BBN                 PDP-10 (B)\n  \
    \    71                Rand                PDP-10\n      13                Case\
    \                PDP-10\n      15                Ames/(Paoli)        ILLIAC/(B6500)\n\
    \      16                Ames                IBM-360/67\n   2) Hosts which are\
    \ currently intended to be users only.\n      Included here are the Terminal IMPs,\
    \ which are\n      presently in the Network (AMES, MITRE, NBS and BBN*).\n   \
    \   This category also includes the Network Control Center\n      Computer (Network\
    \ Address 5) which is used solely for\n      gathering statistics from the Network.\
    \ Finally,\n      included among these Hosts are the following:\n   -------  \

    \ installed in\nWashington at the beginning of December.\n     The tables on the\
