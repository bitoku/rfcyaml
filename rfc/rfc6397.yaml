  - "1.  Introduction\n   Researchers and engineers often wish to analyze network
    behavior by\n   studying routing protocol transactions and routing information
    base\n   snapshots in relation to geographical topologies.  Usually, the\n   Border
    Gateway Protocol [RFC4271] is the subject of study, and the\n   analysis can be
    significantly aided by the availability and extension\n   of the \"Multi-Threaded
    Routing Toolkit (MRT) Routing Information\n   Export Format\" [RFC6396].  The
    MRT format was originally defined in\n   the MRT Programmer's Guide [MRT-GUIDE].\n
    \  The addition of geo-location coordinates (longitude and latitude)\n   pertaining
    to the geographical location of both the BGP collector and\n   its BGP peers to
    BGP export data enables a researcher or enquiring\n   individual to gain a terrestrial
    insight to the routes seen by a BGP\n   speaker.  Such data may ultimately aid
    researchers in understanding\n   any disparity between the geographical location
    of networks and the\n   topological location of networks in addition to the relationships\n
    \  between geographical position and routing anomalies.  Such insight\n   could
    provide future input into network design and network security.\n   This memo documents
    an optional extension to the MRT format [RFC6396]\n   and introduces an additional
    definition of an MRT Subtype field that\n   includes the terrestrial coordinates
    of a BGP collector and its BGP\n   peers.\n"

  - "5.  BGP Collector Construction\n   This section aids the reader in understanding
    the function of a BGP\n   collector.\n   The BGP collector is a hardware- or software-based
    device that speaks\n   the Border Gateway Protocol.  Its intended function is
    to store (and\n   archive) the BGP routing data it receives from other BGP speakers\n
    \  with which it has peering relationships, providing data for later\n   analysis.
    \ The general nature of a BGP collector is that it is a\n   passive device in
    that it listens to route updates and does not\n   announce or propagate any information
    it knows or receives.  It\n   should be noted that this is not always the case;
    network operators\n   sometimes enable the collection of BGP routing data on active
    BGP\n   speakers to obtain a situational view of the routing system as they\n
    \  see it at a particular point in time.\n   As a fully fledged BGP speaker, the
    BGP collector can fit into any\n   BGP topology including Internal BGP (iBGP),
    External BGP (eBGP), and\n   so on.  The implementation of a BGP collector in
    a network topology\n   is therefore limited by that network's use of BGP.\n"

  - "6.  Privacy Considerations\n   The GEOPRIV [RFC6280] architecture requires that
    privacy rules\n   attached to a location object be transmitted alongside the location\n
    \  information in the object.  If a BGP collector adds location\n   coordinates
    to an MRT record based on GEOPRIV location objects, then\n   it would have to
    include privacy rules as well.  Since the MRT geo-\n   location format does not
    support the provision of privacy rules, each\n   location entry in an MRT object
    is assigned the following default\n   privacy rules [RFC4119]:\n   -- retransmission-allowed:
    True\n   -- retention-expires: 100 years from timestamp of the MRT object\n   --
    ruleset-reference: Empty\n   -- note-well: Empty\n   Location information derived
    from a location object with more\n   restrictive privacy rules MUST NOT be included
    in an MRT geo-location\n   record unless there are non-technical measures in place
    that enforce\n   and communicate the constraints on the use of the location\n
    \  information in the MRT geo-location format (e.g., contractual\n   agreements
    between peers).\n"

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   This extension to the MRT format [RFC6396] defines
    fields that are of\n   a descriptive nature and provides information that is useful
    in the\n   analysis of routing systems.  As such, the author believes that they\n
    \  do not constitute an additional network-based security risk.  It is\n   recommended
    that the operators of the BGP collector and BGP peers\n   consider their own privacy
    and security concerns before supplying\n   geographical coordinates to BGP data
    collection systems.  Special\n   attention should be given to the physical security
    of an organization\n   before supplying geographical coordinates, especially if
    the\n   resulting BGP data with geo-location extensions is made public.\n   Entities
    that operate BGP collectors, and users of data provided by\n   BGP collectors,
    should be aware that the geo-location data supplied\n   by a peer can only be
    taken at face value.  It is possible that a BGP\n   peer may supply coordinates
    that are purposefully misleading or\n   inaccurate.  It is therefore up to the
    BGP collector whether or not\n   to include this information or use its own methods
    to either trust or\n   validate the data provided.  It is not recommended that
    a BGP\n   collector use geographical coordinates not supplied by a BGP peer.\n"
