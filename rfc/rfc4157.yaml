  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies the prospero Uniform Resource Identifier\n\
    \   (URI) scheme that was originally specified in RFC 1738.  The purpose\n   of\
    \ this document is to allow RFC 1738 to be made obsolete while\n   keeping the\
    \ information about the scheme on standards track.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   URIs were previously defined in RFC 2396 [RFC2396], which\
    \ was updated\n   by RFC 3986 [RFC3986].  Those documents also specify how to\
    \ define\n   schemes for URIs.\n   The first definitions for many URI schemes\
    \ appeared in RFC 1738\n   [RFC1738].  Because that document has been made obsolete,\
    \ this\n   document copies the prospero URI scheme from it to allow that\n   material\
    \ to remain on standards track.\n"
- title: 2.  Scheme Definition
  contents:
  - "2.  Scheme Definition\n   The prospero URL scheme is used to designate resources\
    \ that are\n   accessed through the Prospero Directory Service.  The Prospero\n\
    \   protocol is described in the original Prospero specification [PROSP].\n  \
    \ Historical note: The Prospero protocol was not widely implemented and\n   almost\
    \ no Prospero servers are in use today.\n   A prospero URL takes the form:\n \
    \  prospero://<host>:<port>/<hsoname>;<field>=<value>\n   If :<port> is omitted,\
    \ the port defaults to 1525.  No username or\n   password is allowed.\n   The\
    \ <hsoname> is the host-specific object name in the Prospero\n   protocol, suitably\
    \ encoded.  This name is opaque and interpreted by\n   the Prospero server.  The\
    \ semicolon \";\" is reserved and may not\n   appear without quoting in the <hsoname>.\n\
    \   Prospero URLs are interpreted by contacting a Prospero directory\n   server\
    \ on the specified host and port to determine appropriate access\n   methods for\
    \ a resource.  The access methods might themselves be\n   represented as different\
    \ URLs.  External Prospero links are\n   represented as URLs of the underlying\
    \ access method and are not\n   represented as Prospero URLs.\n   Note that a\
    \ slash \"/\" may appear in the <hsoname> without quoting,\n   and no significance\
    \ may be assumed by the application.  Though\n   slashes may indicate hierarchical\
    \ structure on the server, such\n   structure is not guaranteed.  Note that many\
    \ <hsoname>s begin with a\n   slash, in which case the host or port will be followed\
    \ by a double\n   slash: the slash from the URL syntax, followed by the initial\
    \ slash\n   from the <hsoname> (e.g., <URL:prospero://example.com//pros/name>\n\
    \   designates a <hsoname> of \"/pros/name\").\n   In addition, after the <hsoname>,\
    \ optional fields and values\n   associated with a Prospero link may be specified\
    \ as part of the URL.\n   When present, each field/value pair is separated from\
    \ each other and\n   from the rest of the URL by a \";\" (semicolon).  The name\
    \ of the field\n   and its value are separated by a \"=\" (equal sign).  If present,\
    \ these\n   fields serve to identify the target of the URL.  For example, the\n\
    \   OBJECT-VERSION field can be specified to identify a specific version\n   of\
    \ an object.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   Many security considerations for URI schemes\
    \ are discussed in\n   [RFC3986].  [PROSP] uses passwords in the clear for authentication,\n\
    \   and offers no privacy, both of which are considered extremely unsafe\n   in\
    \ current practice.\n"
