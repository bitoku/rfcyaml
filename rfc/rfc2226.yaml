- title: 1.  Introduction.
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction.\n   The IETF's first step in solving the problems of running\
    \ IP over\n   Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology is described in RFC\
    \ 1577\n   [1].  It provides for unicast communication between hosts and routers\n\
    \   within Logical IP Subnets (LISs), and proposes a centralized ATM ARP\n   Server\
    \ which provides IP to ATM address resolution services to LIS\n   members.\n \
    \  Two classes of IP service were omitted - multicast and broadcast\n   transmissions.\
    \ Multicasting allows a single transmit operation to\n   cause a packet to be\
    \ received by multiple remote destinations.\n   Broadcasting typically allows\
    \ a single transmit operation to cause a\n   packet to be received by all IP hosts\
    \ that are members of a\n   particular 'subnet'.\n   To address the need for multicast\
    \ support (represented by\n   transmission to IP addresses in the Class D space),\
    \ RFC 2022\n   (\"Support for Multicast over UNI 3.0/3.1 based ATM Networks\"\
    ) [2] was\n   created.  This memo creates an analog of the RFC 1577 ARP Server\
    \ - a\n   new entity known as the MARS (Multicast Address Resolution Server).\n\
    \   The MARS operates as a centralized registry and distribution\n   mechanism\
    \ for mappings between IP multicast addresses and groups of\n   ATM unicast addresses.\
    \ Host behavior is also defined for establishing\n   and managing point to multipoint\
    \ VCs, based on the information\n   returned by the MARS, when hosts wish to transmit\
    \ packets to a\n   multicast group.\n   This memo aims to show how RFC 2022 may\
    \ be used to emulate IP\n   broadcast within Logical IP Subnets. While the broadcast\
    \ technique\n   does not align itself well with the underlying point-to-point\
    \ nature\n   of ATM, clearly, some applications will still wish to use IP\n  \
    \ broadcasts.  Client-server applications where the client searches for\n   a\
    \ server by sending out a broadcast is one scenario.  Routing\n   protocols, most\
    \ notably RIP, are other examples.\n"
- title: 2.  Review of Unicast and Multicast.
  contents:
  - "2.  Review of Unicast and Multicast.\n   Both the unicast and multicast cases\
    \ take advantage of the point-to-\n   point and point-to-multipoint capabilities\
    \ defined in the ATM Forum\n   UNI 3.1 document [4].  A unicast IP address has\
    \ a single ATM level\n   destination.  Unicast transmissions occur over point\
    \ to point Virtual\n   Channels (VCs) between the source and destination. The\
    \ ARP Server\n   holds mappings between IP destination addresses and their associated\n\
    \   ATM destination address. Hosts issue an ARP_REQUEST to the ARP Server\n  \
    \ when they wish to ascertain a particular mapping.  The ARP Server\n   replies\
    \ with either an ARP_REPLY containing the ATM address of the\n   destination,\
    \ or an ARP_NAK when the ARP Server is unable to resolve\n   the address. If the\
    \ request is successful the host establishes a VC\n   to the destination interface.\
    \ This VC is then used to forward the\n   first (and subsequent) packets to that\
    \ particular IP destination. RFC\n   1577 describes in further detail how hosts\
    \ are administratively\n   grouped in to Logical IP Subnets (LISs), and how the\
    \ ARP Server\n   establishes the initial mappings for members of the LIS it serves.\n\
    \   The basic host behavior for multicasting is similar - the sender must\n  \
    \ establish and manage a point to multipoint VC whose leaf nodes are\n   the group's\
    \ actual members. Under UNI 3.1 these VCs can only be\n   established and altered\
    \ by the source (root) interface.\n   The MARS is an evolution of the ARP Server\
    \ model, and performs two\n   key functions.  The first function is the maintenance\
    \ of a list of\n   ATM addresses corresponding to the members for each group.\
    \  This list\n   is created by a host registration process which involves two\
    \ messages\n   - a MARS_JOIN which declares that a host wishes to join the specified\n\
    \   group(s), and a MARS_LEAVE which indicates that a host wishes to\n   leave\
    \ the specified group(s).\n   MARS_JOIN and MARS_LEAVE messages are also redistributed\
    \ to all\n   members of the group so that active senders may dynamically adjust\n\
    \   their point to multipoint VCs accordingly.\n   The other major function is\
    \ the retrieval of group membership from\n   MARS (analogous to the ARP Server\
    \ providing unicast address\n   mappings). When faced with the need to transmit\
    \ an IP packet with a\n   Class D destination address, a host issues a MARS_REQUEST\
    \ to the\n   MARS. If the group has members the MARS returns a MARS_MULTI\n  \
    \ (possibly in multiple segments) carrying a set of ATM addresses. The\n   host\
    \ then establishes an initial point to multipoint VC using these\n   ATM addresses\
    \ as the leaf nodes. If the MARS had no mapping it would\n   return a MARS_NAK.\n\
    \   (RFC 2022 also discusses how the MARS can arrange for Class D groups\n   to\
    \ be supported by either multicast servers, or meshes of point to\n   multipoint\
    \ VCs from host to host.  However, from the host's\n   perspective this is transparent,\
    \ and is not central to this\n   discussion of IP broadcast support.)\n   This\
    \ memo describes how a host may utilize the registration and group\n   management\
    \ functions in an existing MARS based IP/ATM network to\n   emulate IP broadcasts.\n"
- title: 3.  Broadcast as a special case of Multicast.
  contents:
  - "3.  Broadcast as a special case of Multicast.\n   Many of the problems that occur\
    \ when implementing a broadcast\n   solution also occur in when implementing a\
    \ multicast solution.  In\n   fact, broadcast may be considered a special case\
    \ of multicast.  That\n   is, broadcast is a multicast group whose members include\
    \ all members\n   in the LIS.\n   There are two broadcast groups which this memo\
    \ addresses:\n      1) 255.255.255.255 - \"All ones\" broadcast\n      2) x.z\
    \ - CIDR-prefix (subnet) directed broadcast\n   Broadcast (1) is sometimes referred\
    \ to as a limited broadcast to this\n   physical network.  Broadcast (2) can be\
    \ thought of as the the\n   broadcast for subnets or networks in the old paradigm.\
    \ As described\n   in [6] and [7], the notion of subnets and networks is being\
    \ replaced\n   with a more efficient utilization of the routing address space\
    \ known\n   as Classless Inter-Domain Routing.  The CIDR-prefix (x) is the\n \
    \  combination of IP address and subnet mask that denotes the subnet\n   number.\
    \  The host portion of the address (z) is all ones.  One should\n   note that\
    \ while these broadcasts have different scopes at the IP or\n   network layer,\
    \ they have precisely the same scope at the link layer\n   -- namely that all\
    \ members of the LIS will receive a copy.\n   These addresses may be used in two\
    \ environments:\n      o  Broadcasting to all members of a given LIS where\n \
    \        a priori knowledge of a host's IP address and\n         subnet mask are\
    \ known (e.g. the CIDR-prefix directed\n         broadcast).\n      o  Broadcasting\
    \ to all members of a physical network\n         without knowledge of a host's\
    \ IP address and\n         subnet mask (e.g. the all ones broadcast).\n   On a\
    \ broadcast medium like Ethernet, these two environments result in\n   the same\
    \ physical destination.  That is, all stations on that network\n   will receive\
    \ the broadcast even if they are on different logical\n   subnets, or are non-IP\
    \ stations.  With ATM, this may not be the case.\n   Because ATM is non-broadcast,\
    \ a registration process must take place.\n   And if there are stations that register\
    \ to some broadcast groups, but\n   not others, then the different broadcast groups\
    \ will have different\n   memberships.  The notion of broadcast becomes inconsistent.\n\
    \   One case that requires the use of the all ones broadcast is that of\n   the\
    \ diskless boot, or bootp client, where the host boots up, and does\n   not know\
    \ its own IP address or subnet mask.  Clearly, the host does\n   not know which\
    \ subnet it belongs to.   So, to send a broadcast to its\n   bootp server, the\
    \ diskless workstation must use the group which\n   contains no subnet information,\
    \ i.e. the 255.255.255.255 broadcast\n   group.  Carrying the example a little\
    \ further, the bootp server,\n   after receiving the broadcast, can not send either\
    \ a directed frame\n   nor a subnet directed broadcast to respond to the diskless\n\
    \   workstation.  Instead, the bootp server must also use the\n   255.255.255.255\
    \ group to communicate with the client.\n   While the all ones broadcast is required\
    \ at the IP layer, it also has\n   relevance at the link layer when deciding which\
    \ broadcast group to\n   register with in MARS.  In other words, a bootp client\
    \ wishing to\n   register for a link layer broadcast, can only register for\n\
    \   255.255.255.255 in the MARS address space because the client's subnet\n  \
    \ is unknown at the time.  Given that some applications must use the\n   all ones\
    \ address in MARS for their broadcast group, and that we wish\n   to minimize\
    \ the number of broadcast groups used by LIS members, the\n   all ones group in\
    \ MARS MUST be used by all members of the LIS when\n   registering to receive\
    \ broadcast transmissions.  The VCC used for\n   transmitting any broadcast packet\
    \ will be based on the members\n   registered in the MARS under the 255.255.255.255\
    \ address position.\n   This VCC will be referred to as the \"broadcast channel\"\
    \ through the\n   remainder of this memo.\n"
- title: 4.  The MARS role in broadcast.
  contents:
  - "4.  The MARS role in broadcast.\n   Many solutions have been proposed, some of\
    \ which are listed in\n   Appendix A.  This memo addresses a MARS solution which\
    \ appears to do\n   the best job of solving the broadcast problem.\n   There are\
    \ a number of characteristics of the MARS architecture that\n   should be kept\
    \ intact.  They include:\n   o  MARS contains no knowledge of subnet prefixes\
    \ and subnet masks.\n      Each group address registered with MARS is managed\
    \ independently.\n   o  A MARS may only serve one LIS. This insures that the\n\
    \      broadcast group 255.255.255.255 is joined by hosts from one\n      LIS,\
    \ keeping its scope bound to conventional interpretation.\n   o  The Multicast\
    \ Server (MCS) described in [2] may be used to service\n      the broadcast groups\
    \ defined in this memo without modification.\n      The MCS will reduce the number\
    \ of channels used by the network.\n   The MARS needs no additional code or special\
    \ algorithms to handle the\n   resolution of IP broadcast addresses. It is simply\
    \ a general database\n   that holds {Protocol address, ATM.1, ATM.2, ... ATM.n}\
    \ mappings, and\n   imposes no constraints on the type and length of the 'Protocol\n\
    \   address'. Whether the hosts view it as Class D or 'broadcast' (or\n   even\
    \ IP) is purely a host side issue.\n   It is likely that end points will want\
    \ to use the IP broadcast\n   emulation described here in order to support boot\
    \ time location of\n   the end point's IP address. This leads to the observation\
    \ that the\n   MARS should NOT expect to see both the IP source and ATM source\n\
    \   address fields of the MARS_JOIN filled in.  This is reasonable, since\n  \
    \ only the ATM source address is used when registering the end point as\n   a\
    \ group member.\n   The MARS architecture is sufficient to insure the integrity\
    \ of the\n   broadcast group list without any modification.\n"
- title: 5.  Host Requirements for Broadcast.
  contents:
  - "5.  Host Requirements for Broadcast.\n   The following list of bullets describes\
    \ additional characteristics of\n   a MARS-compliant host.  These characteristics\
    \ are required to take\n   advantage of the broadcast function.\n   o  A host\
    \ must register as a MARS client.\n   o  A host, soon after registration MUST\
    \ issue a MARS_JOIN to the\n      all ones broadcast address (i.e. 255.255.255.255)\
    \ with the\n      mar$flags.layer3grp reset.\n   o  When transmitting packets,\
    \ the host should map all IP layer\n      broadcasts to the VCC (broadcast channel)\
    \ created and maintained\n      based on the all ones entry in MARS.\n   o  A\
    \ host MUST monitor the MARS_JOIN/MARS_LEAVE messages\n      for 255.255.255.255\
    \ to keep the broadcast channel current.\n   o  A broadcast channel should be\
    \ torn down after a period of\n      inactivity.  The corresponding timeout period\
    \ MAY be specified\n      with a minimum value of one minute, and a RECOMMENDED\n\
    \      default value of 20 minutes.\n   One should note that while every member\
    \ participating in the\n   broadcast MUST be a member of the all ones group, not\
    \ all members\n   will choose to transmit broadcast information.  Some members\
    \ will\n   only elect to receive broadcast information passively.  Therefore,\
    \ in\n   a LIS with n stations, there may be less than n channels terminated\n\
    \   at each station for broadcast information.  Further reductions may be\n  \
    \ gained by adding a Multicast Server (MCS) to the broadcast\n   environment which\
    \ could reduce the number of VCs to two (one\n   incoming, one outgoing), or one\
    \ for a station that only wishes to\n   listen.\n   It is well understood that\
    \ broadcasting in this environment may tax\n   the resources of the network and\
    \ of the hosts that use it.\n   Therefore, an implementer MAY choose to provide\
    \ a mechanism for\n   retracting the host's entry in the broadcast group after\
    \ it has been\n   established or prior to joining the group.  The MARS_LEAVE is\
    \ used to\n   request withdrawal from the group if the host wishes to disable\n\
    \   broadcast reception after it has joined the group.  The default\n   behavior\
    \ SHALL be to join the all ones broadcast group in MARS.\n"
- title: 6.  Implications of IP broadcast on ATM level resources.
  contents:
  - "6.  Implications of IP broadcast on ATM level resources.\n   RFC 2022 discusses\
    \ some of the implications of large multicast groups\n   on the allocation of\
    \ ATM level resources, both within the network and\n   within end station ATM\
    \ interfaces.\n   The default mechanism is for IP multicasting to be achieved\
    \ using\n   meshes of point to multipoint VCs, direct from source host to group\n\
    \   members. Under certain circumstances system administrators may, in a\n   manner\
    \ completely transparent to end hosts, redirect multicast\n   traffic through\
    \ ATM level Multicast Servers (MCSs). This may be\n   performed on an individual\
    \ group basis.\n   It is sufficient to note here that the IP broadcast 'multicast\
    \ group'\n   will constitute the largest consumer of VCs within your ATM network\n\
    \   when it is active. For this reason it will probably be the first\n   multicast\
    \ group to have one or more ATM MCSs assigned to support it.\n   However, there\
    \ is nothing unique about an MCS assigned to support IP\n   broadcast traffic,\
    \ so this will not be dealt with further in this\n   memo. RFC 2022 contains further\
    \ discussion on the possible\n   application of multiple MCSs to provide fault-tolerant\
    \ architectures.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.  Further discussion.\n   A point of discussion on the ip-atm forum revolved\
    \ around \"auto\n   configuration\" and \"diskless boot\".  This memo describes\
    \ a broadcast\n   solution that requires the use of the MARS.  Therefore, at a\
    \ minimum,\n   the ATM address of the MARS must be manually configured into a\n\
    \   diskless workstation.  Suggestions such as universal channel numbers,\n  \
    \ and universal ATM addresses have been proposed, however, no agreement\n   has\
    \ been reached.\n   Another topic for discussion is multiprotocol support.  MARS\
    \ is\n   designed for protocol independence.  This memo specifically addresses\n\
    \   the IP broadcast case, identifying which addresses are most effective\n  \
    \ in the IP address space.  However, the principles apply to any layer\n   3 protocol.\
    \  Further work should be performed to identify suitable\n   addresses for other\
    \ layer 3 protocols.\n   Finally, there has been support voiced for a link layer\
    \ broadcast\n   that would be independent of the layer 3 protocol.  Such a solution\n\
    \   may provide a simpler set of rules through which broadcast\n   applications\

- title: A.1.1  Base Solution without modifications to ARP Server.
  contents:
  - "A.1.1  Base Solution without modifications to ARP Server.\n   One may choose\
    \ as an existing starting point to use only what is\n   available in RFC 1577.\
    \  That is, a host can easily calculate the\n   range of members in its LIS based\
    \ on its own IP address and subnet\n   mask.  The host can then issue an ARP Request\
    \ for every member of the\n   LIS.  With this information, the host can then set\
    \ up point-to-point\n   connections with all members, or can set up a point-to-multipoint\n\
    \   connection to all members.  There you have it, the poor man's\n   broadcast.\n\
    \   While this solution is very straight forward, it suffers from a\n   number\
    \ of problems.\n   o  The load on the ARP Server is very large.  If all stations\
    \ on\n      a LIS choose to implement broadcasting, the initial surge of ARP\n\
    \      Requests will be huge.  Some sort of slow start sequence would be\n   \
    \   needed.\n   o  The amount of resource required makes this a non-scalable\n\
    \      solution.  The authors believe that broadcasting will require an\n    \
    \  MCS to reduce the number of channel resources required to support\n      each\
    \ broadcast 'group'.  Using the ARP Server in this manner does\n      not allow\
    \ an MCS to be transparently introduced. (Basic RFC1577\n      interfaces also\
    \ do not implement the extended LLC/SNAP\n      encapsulation required to safely\
    \ use more than one MCS).\n   o  The diskless boot solution can not function in\
    \ this environment\n      because it may be unable to determine which subnet to\
    \ which it\n      belongs.\n"
- title: A.1.2  Enhanced ARP Server solution.
  contents:
  - "A.1.2  Enhanced ARP Server solution.\n   This solution is similar to the base\
    \ solution except that it takes\n   some of the (MARS) multicast solution and\
    \ embeds it in the ARP\n   Server.  The first enhancement is to add the MARS_MULTI\
    \ command to\n   the set of opcodes that the ARP Server supports.  This would\
    \ allow a\n   host to issue a single request, and to get back the list of members\n\
    \   in one or more MARS_REPLY packets.  Rather than have a registration\n   mechanism,\
    \ the ARP Server could simply use the list of members that\n   have already been\
    \ registered.  When a request comes in for the subnet\n   broadcast address, the\
    \ ARP Server would aggregate the list, and send\n   the results to the requester.\n\
    \   This suffers from two drawbacks.\n   1)  Scalability with regard to number\
    \ of VCs is still an issue.\n       One would eventually need to add in some sort\
    \ of multicast\n       server solution to the ARP Server.\n   2)  The diskless\
    \ boot scenario is still broken.  There is no\n       way for a station to perform\

  - "A.2  MARS Solutions.\n   If we wish to keep the ARP Server constant as described\
    \ in RFC 1577,\n   the alternative is to use the Multicast Address Resolution\
    \ Server\n   (MARS) described in [2].\n   MARS has three nice features for broadcasting.\n\
    \   1)  It has a generalized registration approach which allows\n       for any\
    \ address to have a group of entities registered.\n       So, if the subnet address\
    \ is not known, a host can\n       register for an address that is known (e.g.\
    \ 255.255.255.255).\n   2)  The command set allows for lists of members to be\
    \ passed\n       in a single MARS_MULTI packet.   This reduces traffic.\n   3)\
    \  MARS contains an architecture for dealing with the\n       scalability issues.\
    \  That is, Multicast Servers (MCSs)\n       may be used to set up the point-to-multipoint\
    \ channels\n       and reduce the number of channels that a host needs to\n  \
    \     set up to one.  Hosts wishing to broadcast will instead\n       send the\
    \ packet to the MCS who will then forward it to\n       all members of the LIS.\n"
- title: A.2.1.  CIDR-prefix (Subnet) Broadcast solution.
  contents:
  - "A.2.1.  CIDR-prefix (Subnet) Broadcast solution.\n   One of the earliest solutions\
    \ was to simply state that broadcast\n   support would be implemented by using\
    \ a single multicast group in the\n   class D address space -- namely, the CIDR-prefix\
    \ (subnet) broadcast\n   address group.  All members of a LIS would be required\
    \ to register to\n   this address, and use it as required.  A host wishing to\
    \ use either\n   the 255.255.255.255 broadcast, or the network broadcast addresses\n\
    \   would internally map the VC to the subnet broadcast VC.  The all ones\n  \
    \ and network broadcast addresses would exist on MARS, but would be\n   unused.\n\
    \   The problem with this approach goes back to the diskless workstation\n   problem.\
    \  Because the workstation may not know which subnet it\n   belongs to, it doesn't\
    \ know which group to register with.\n"
- title: A.2.2.  All one's first, subnet broadcast second
  contents:
  - "A.2.2.  All one's first, subnet broadcast second\n   This solution acknowledges\
    \ that the diskless boot problem requires a\n   generic address (one that does\
    \ not contain CIDR-prefix (subnet)\n   information) to register with and to use\
    \ until subnet knowledge is\n   known.  In essence, all stations first register\
    \ to the\n   255.255.255.255 group, then as they know their subnet information,\n\
    \   they could optionally de-register from the all one's group and\n   register\
    \ to the CIDR-prefix (subnet) broadcast group.\n   This solution would appear\
    \ to solve a couple of problems:\n   1)  The bootp client can function if the\
    \ server remains\n       registered to the all one's group continuously.\n   2)\
    \  There will be less traffic using the all ones group\n       because the preferred\
    \ transactions will be on the\n       subnet broadcast channel.\n   Unfortunately\
    \ the first bullet contains a flaw.  The server must\n   continually be registered\
    \ to two groups -- the all ones group and the\n   subnet broadcast group.  If\
    \ this server has multiple processes that\n   are running different IP applications,\
    \ it may be difficult for the\n   link layer to know which broadcast VC to use.\
    \  If it always uses the\n   all ones, then it will be missing members that have\
    \ removed\n   themselves from the all ones and have registered to the subnet\n\
    \   broadcast.  If it always uses the subnet broadcast group, the\n   diskless\
    \ boot scenario gets broken.  While making the decision at the\n   link layer\
    \ may require additional control flows be built into the\n   path, it may also\
    \ require the rewriting of application software.\n   In some implementations,\
    \ a simple constant is used to indicate to the\n   link layer that this packet\
    \ is to be transmitted to the broadcast\n   \"MAC\" address.  The assumption is\
    \ that the physical network broadcast\n   and the logical protocol broadcast are\
    \ one and the same.  As pointed\n   out earlier, this is not the case with ATM.\
    \  Therefore applications\n   would need to specifically identify the subnet broadcast\
    \ group\n   address to take advantage of the smaller group.\n   These problems\
    \ could be solved in a number of ways, but it was\n   thought that they added\
    \ unnecessarily to the complexity of the\n   broadcast solution.\n"
- title: Appendix B.  Should MARS Be Limited to a Single LIS?
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.  Should MARS Be Limited to a Single LIS?\n   RFC 2022 explicitly\
    \ states that a network administrator MUST ensure\n   that each LIS is served\
    \ by a separate MARS, creating a one-to-one\n   mapping between cluster and a\
    \ unicast LIS.  But, it also mentions\n   that relaxation of this restriction\
    \ MAY occur after future research\n   warrants it.  This appendix discusses some\
    \ to the potential\n   implications to broadcast should this restriction be removed.\n\
    \   The most obvious change would be that the notion of a cluster would\n   span\
    \ more than one LIS.  Therefore, the broadcast group of\n   255.255.255.255 would\
    \ contain members from more than one LIS.\n   It also should be emphasized that\
    \ the one LIS limitation is not a\n   restriction of the MARS architecture.  Rather,\
    \ it is only enforced if\n   an administrator chooses to do so.\n"
