    \ fully described in the \"Secure Hash Standard\" [FIPS180-3].\n   The listed\

    \ hashalgs(2) 3 }\n   When one of these OIDs appears in an AlgorithmIdentifier,\
    \ all\n   implementations MUST accept both NULL and absent parameters as legal\n\
    \   and equivalent encodings.\n   Conforming certification authority (CA) implementations\
    \ SHOULD use\n   SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512 when generating certificates\
