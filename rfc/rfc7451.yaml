- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Domain name registries implement a variety of operational\
    \ and\n   business models.  The differences in these models make it impossible\n\
    \   to develop a \"one size fits all\" provisioning protocol; the\n   Extensible\
    \ Provisioning Protocol [RFC5730] was designed to focus on a\n   minimal set of\
    \ common functionality with built-in extension\n   capabilities that allow new\
    \ features to be specified on an \"as\n   needed\" basis.  Guidelines for extending\
    \ EPP are documented in RFC\n   3735 [RFC3735].\n   RFCs 3735 and 5730 do not\
    \ describe how extension development can be\n   managed and coordinated.  This\
    \ has led to a situation in which server\n   operators can develop different extensions\
    \ to address similar needs,\n   such as the provisioning of Value Added Tax (VAT)\
    \ information.\n   Clients then need to support multiple extensions that serve\
    \ similar\n   purposes, and interoperability suffers as a result.\n   An IANA\
    \ registry can be used to help manage and coordinate the\n   development of protocol\
    \ extensions.  This document describes an IANA\n   registry that will be used\
    \ to coordinate the development of EPP\n   extensions.\n"
- title: 2.  Extension Specification and Registration Procedure
  contents:
  - "2.  Extension Specification and Registration Procedure\n   This section describes\
    \ the format of an IANA registry and the\n   procedures used to populate and manage\
    \ registry entries.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Extension Specification
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Extension Specification\n   This registry uses the \"Specification Required\"\
    \ policy described in\n   RFC 5226 [RFC5226].  An English language version of\
    \ the extension\n   specification will be referenced from the registry, though\
    \ non-\n   English versions of the specification may also be provided.  Note\n\
    \   that Section 2.1 of RFC 3735 [RFC3735] provides specific guidelines\n   for\
    \ documenting EPP extensions.\n   Note that the \"Specification Required\" policy\
    \ implies review by a\n   \"designated expert\".  Section 3 of RFC 5226 [RFC5226]\
    \ describes the\n   role of designated experts and the function they perform.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  Designated Expert Evaluation Criteria
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Designated Expert Evaluation Criteria\n   A high-level description of\
    \ the role of the designated expert is\n   described in Section 3.2 of RFC 5226\
    \ [RFC5226].  Specific guidelines\n   for the appointment of designated experts\
    \ and the evaluation of EPP\n   extensions are provided here.\n   The IESG should\
    \ appoint a small pool of individuals (perhaps 3 - 5)\n   to serve as designated\
    \ experts, as described in Section 3.2 of RFC\n   5226 [RFC5226].  The pool should\
    \ have a single administrative chair\n   who is appointed by the IESG.  The designated\
    \ experts should use the\n   existing eppext mailing list (eppext@ietf.org) for\
    \ public discussion\n   of registration requests.  This implies that the mailing\
    \ list should\n   remain open after the work of the EPPEXT working group has concluded.\n\
    \   Extensions should be evaluated for architectural soundness using the\n   guidelines\
    \ described in RFC 3735 [RFC3735], including the Security\n   Considerations section\
    \ of that document.  Expert evaluation should\n   explicitly include consideration\
    \ of the privacy consequences of\n   proposed extensions, and, at a minimum, ensure\
    \ that any privacy\n   considerations are fully documented in the relevant specification(s).\n\
    \   The results of the evaluation should be shared via email with the\n   registrant\
    \ and the eppext mailing list.  Issues discovered during the\n   evaluation can\
    \ be corrected by the registrant, and those corrections\n   can be submitted to\
    \ the designated experts until the designated\n   experts explicitly decide to\
    \ accept or reject the registration\n   request.  The designated experts must\
    \ make an explicit decision and\n   that decision must be shared via email with\
    \ the registrant and the\n   eppext mailing list.  If the specification for an\
    \ extension is an\n   IETF Standards Track document, no review is required by\
    \ the\n   designated expert.\n   Designated experts should be permissive in their\
    \ evaluation of\n   requests to register extensions that have been implemented\
    \ and\n   deployed by at least one registry/registrar pair.  This implies that\n\
    \   it may indeed be possible to register multiple extensions that\n   provide\
    \ the same functionality.  Requests to register extensions that\n   have not been\
    \ deployed should be evaluated with a goal of reducing\n   functional duplication.\
    \  A potential registrant who submits a request\n   to register a new, un-deployed\
    \ extension that includes similar\n   functionality to an existing, registered\
    \ extension should be made\n   aware of the existing extension.  The registrant\
    \ should be asked to\n   reconsider their request given the existence of a similar\
    \ extension.\n   Should they decline to do so, perceived similarity should not\
    \ be a\n   sufficient reason for rejection as long as all other requirements are\n\
    \   met.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Registration Procedure
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Registration Procedure\n   The registry contains information describing\
    \ each registered\n   extension.  Registry entries are created and managed by\
    \ sending forms\n   to IANA that describe the extension and the operation to be\
    \ performed\n   on the registry entry.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.  Required Information
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Required Information\n   Name of Extension: A case-insensitive, ASCII\
    \ text string that\n   contains the name of the extension specification.  Non-ASCII\n\
    \   representations of the extension name can be included in the \"Notes\"\n \
    \  described below.\n   Document Status: The document status (\"Informational\"\
    , \"Standards\n   Track\", etc.) of the specification document.  For documents\
    \ that are\n   not RFCs, this will always be \"Informational\".\n   Reference:\
    \ A publicly available reference to the specification of\n   this extension. \
    \ This could be an RFC number or some other pointer to\n   the document defining\
    \ the extension.\n   Registrant Name and Email Address: The name and email address\
    \ of the\n   person that is responsible for managing the registry entry.  If the\n\
    \   registration is of an IETF Standards Track document, this can simply\n   be\
    \ listed as \"IESG, <iesg@ietf.org>\".\n   TLDs: A text string containing the\
    \ top-level domain name (or domain\n   names), including the preceding \".\",\
    \ for which the extension has been\n   specified (e.g., \".org\").  If there are\
    \ multiple TLDs, they are given\n   as a list of domain names separated by commas,\
    \ (e.g. \".com\", \".net\").\n   Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) TLDs should\
    \ be specified in\n   A-label [RFC5890] format.  If the extension is not associated\
    \ with a\n   specific top-level domain, the case-insensitive text string \"Any\"\
    \ can\n   be used to indicate that.\n   IPR Disclosure: A pointer to any Intellectual\
    \ Property Rights (IPR)\n   disclosure document(s) related to this extension,\
    \ or \"None\" may be\n   used if there are no such disclosures.  This can be an\
    \ IPR disclosure\n   filed with the IETF in accordance with RFC 3979 [RFC3979]\
    \ as updated\n   by RFC 4879 [RFC4879] if the extension is part of an IETF\n \
    \  Contribution, or it can be other IPR disclosure documents identifying\n   the\
    \ claimed intellectual property rights and terms of use for\n   extensions that\
    \ are not part of an IETF Contribution.\n   Status: Either \"Active\" or \"Inactive\"\
    .  The \"Active\" status is used\n   for extensions that are currently implemented\
    \ and in use.  The\n   \"Inactive\" status is used for extensions that are not\
    \ implemented or\n   are otherwise not being used.\n   Notes: Either \"None\"\
    \ or other text that describes optional notes to\n   be included with the registered\
    \ extension.  If the Status value is\n   \"Inactive\", text should be included\
    \ to describe how and when this\n   state was reached.\n"

    \ form to IANA to update the registrant information.\n   Entries can change state\
    \ from \"Active\" to \"Inactive\" and back again\n   as long as state-change requests\
    \ conform to the processing\n   requirements identified in this document.  In\
    \ addition to entries\n   that become \"Inactive\" due to a lack of implementation,\
