  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document contains the body parts defined in RFC 1495\
    \ for\n   carrying image formats that were originally defined in MIME through\n\
    \   an X.400 system.\n   It also documents the OIDs assigned to these data formats\
    \ as FTAM\n   body parts, which allow the MIME types to be converted to FTAM body\n\
    \   parts; this will probably be more useful than the new body parts\n   defined\
    \ here.\n"
