  - "                             Mail Priority\n   In RFC 539 (NIC--17644,3d:gy)\
    \ Postel and I suggested that mail\n   senders be allowed to assign a degree of\
    \ priority to their mail.\n   White (RFC 555--17993,6c:gy) objected to defining\
    \ shades of urgency,\n   without having their effects upon the Mail Protocol server\
    \ also\n   defined.\n   If priority levels were to be assigned by automata, I\
    \ would agree\n   with Jim.  Unfortunately, the human sender of the mail will\
    \ usually\n   be the one to assign the priority, and humans will not be consistent\n\
    \   in that assignment.\n   Also unfortunately, the concept of urgency is an integral\
    \ part of\n   communication.  If it weren't, we could ignore its inclusion into\
    \ the\n   MP.\n   Since distinctions in urgency are useful (necessary?) and since\n\
    \   humans will be the ones assigning specific degrees of urgency\n   (thereby\
    \ making it impossible for server processes to automatically\n   do the \"right\
    \ thing\" in response), we suggested only including the\n   INFORMATION as part\
    \ of the protocol.  Let the human and server-\n   process receivers decide between\
    \ themselves how the server-process\n   should deal with that information.\n \
    \  Now that I have argued all that, let me suggest interpretations for\n   urgency\
    \ values.  This is so that programmers can have automata-\n   generated mail (e.g.,\
    \ notification of the status of previously sent\n   mail) carry reasonable urgency\
    \ values:\n      10  Phone in the middle of the night, if necessary.\n       9\n\
    \       8  Deliver to user's terminal NOW.\n       7\n       6  Deliver to user's\
    \ terminal only if user is at \"exec\"\n          level.\n       5\n       4 \
    \ Deliver immediately after sign-on or before sign-off.\n       3\n       2  Deliver\
    \ into standard mailbox.\n       1\n       0  Junk Mail\n         [ This RFC was\
