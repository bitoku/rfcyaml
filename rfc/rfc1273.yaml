  - "Introduction\n   The global TCP/IP Internet interconnects millions of individuals\
    \ at\n   thousands of institutions worldwide, offering the potential for\n   significant\
    \ collaboration through network services and electronic\n   information exchange.\
    \  At the same time, such powerful connectivity\n   offers many avenues for security\
    \ violations, as evidenced by a number\n   of well publicized events over the\
    \ past few years.  In response, many\n   sites have imposed mechanisms to limit\
    \ their exposure to security\n   intrusions, ranging from disabling certain inter-site\
    \ services, to\n   using external gateways that only allow electronic mail delivery,\
    \ to\n   gateways that limit remote interactions via access control lists, to\n\
    \   disconnection from the Internet.  While these measures are preferable\n  \
    \ to the damage that could occur from security violations, taken to an\n   extreme\
    \ they could eventually reduce the Internet to little more than\n   a means of\
    \ supporting certain pre-approved point-to-point data\n   transfers.  Such diminished\
    \ functionality could hinder or prevent the\n   deployment of important new types\
    \ of network services, impeding both\n   research and commercial advancement.\n\
    \   To understand the evolution of this situation, we have designed a\n   study\
    \ to measure changes in Internet service-level reachability over\n   a period\
    \ of one year.  The study considers upper layer service\n   reachability instead\
    \ of basic IP connectivity because the former\n   indicates the willingness of\
    \ organizations to participate in inter-\n   organizational computing, which will\
    \ be an important component of\n   future wide area distributed applications.\n\
    \   The data we gather will contribute to Internet research and\n   engineering\
    \ planning activities in a number of ways.  The data will\n   indicate the mechanisms\
    \ sites use to distance themselves from\n   Internet connectivity, the types of\
    \ services that sites are willing\n   to run (and hence the type of distributed\
    \ collaboration they are\n   willing to support), and variations in these characteristics\
    \ as a\n   function of geographic location and type of institution (commercial,\n\
    \   educational, etc.).  Understanding these trends will allow\n   application\
    \ designers and network builders to more realistically plan\n   for how to support\
    \ future wide area distributed applications such as\n   digital library systems,\
    \ information services, wide area distributed\n   file systems, and conferencing\
    \ and other collaboration-support\n   systems.  The measurements will also be\
    \ of general interest, as they\n   represent direct measurements of the evolution\
    \ of a global electronic\n   society.\n   Clearly, a study of this nature and\
    \ magnitude raises a number of\n   potential concerns.  In this note we overview\
    \ our experimental\n   design, considerations of network and remote site load,\
    \ mechanisms\n   used to control the measurement collection process, and our efforts\n\
    \   to inform sites measured by this study, along with concomitant\n   network\
    \ appropriate use and privacy issues.\n   A point we wish to stress from the outset\
    \ is that this is not a study\n   of network security.  The experiments do not\
    \ attempt to probe the\n   security mechanisms of any machine on the network.\
    \  The study is\n   concerned solely with the evolution of network connectivity\
    \ and\n   service reachability.\n"
- title: Experimental Design
  contents:
  - "Experimental Design\n   The study consists of a set of runs of a program over\
    \ the span of one\n   to two days each month, repeated bimonthly for a period\
    \ of one year\n   (in January 1992, March 1992, May 1992, July 1992, September\
    \ 1992,\n   and November 1992).  Each program run attempts to connect to 13\n\
    \   different TCP services at each of approximately 12,700 Internet\n   domains\
    \ worldwide, recording the failure/success status of each\n   attempt.  The program\
    \ will attempt no data transfers in either\n   direction.  If a connection is\
    \ successful, it is simply closed and\n   counted.  (Note in particular that this\
    \ means that the security\n   mechanism behind individual network services will\
    \ not be tested.)\n   The machines on which connections are attempted will be\
    \ selected at\n   random from a large list of machines in the Internet, constrained\n\
    \   such that at most 1 to 3 machines is contacted in any particular\n   domain.\n\
    \   The services to which connections will be attempted are:\n    __________________________________________________________________\n\
    \      Port Number   Service                Port Number   Service\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \          13        daytime                    111       Sun portmap\n      \
    \    15        netstat                    513       rlogin\n          21     \
    \   FTP                        514       rsh\n          23        telnet     \
    \                540       UUCP\n          25        SMTP                    \

    \  krcmd, kshell\n          79        finger\n     _________________________________________________________________\n\
    \   This list was chosen to span a representative range of  service\n   types,\
    \ each of which can be expected to be found on any machine in a\n   site (so that\
    \ probing random machines is meaningful).  The one\n   exception  is  the  Domain\
    \  Naming  System,  for which the machines\n   to probe are selected from information\
    \  obtained  from the  Domain\n   system itself.  Only TCP services are tested,\
    \ since the TCP\n   connection mechanism  allows  one  to  determine  if  a server\
    \ is\n   running in an application-independent fashion.\n   As an aside, it would\
    \ be possible  to  retrieve  \"Well  Known\n   Service\"  records  from the Domain\
    \ Naming System, as a somewhat less\n   \"invasive\" measurement approach.  However,\
    \  these  records are  not\n   required  for proper network operation, and hence\
    \ are far from\n   complete or consistent in the  Domain  Naming  System.  The\
    \  only way\n   to collect the data we want is to measure them in the fashion\n\
    \   described above.\n"
- title: Network and Remote Site Load
  contents:
  - "Network and Remote Site Load\n   The measurement software is quite careful to\
    \ avoid generating\n   unnecessary internet packets, and to avoid congesting the\
    \ internet\n   with too much concurrent activity.  Once it has successfully\n\
    \   connected to a particular service in a domain, the software never\n   attempts\
    \ to connect to that service on any machine in that domain\n   again, for the\
    \ duration of the current measurement run (i.e., the\n   current 60 days).  Once\
    \ it has recorded 3 connection refusals at any\n   machines in that domain for\
    \ a service, it does not try that service\n   at that domain again during the\
    \ current measurement run.  If it\n   experiences 3 timeouts on any machine in\
    \ a domain, it gives up on the\n   domain, possibly to be retried again a day\
    \ later (to overcome\n   transient network problems).  In the worst case there\
    \ will be 3\n   connection failures for each service at 3 different machines,\
    \ which\n   amounts to 37 connection requests per domain (3 for each of the 12\n\
    \   services other than the Domain Naming System, and one for the Domain\n   Naming\
    \ System).  However, the average will be much less than this.\n   To quantify\
    \ the actual Internet load, we now present some\n   measurements from test runs\
    \ of the measurement software that were\n   performed in August 1991.  In total,\
    \ 50,549 Domain Naming System\n   lookups were performed, and 73,760 connections\
    \ were attempted.  This\n   measurement run completed in approximately 10 hours,\
    \ never initiating\n   more than 20 network operations (name lookups or connection\
    \ attempts)\n   concurrently.  The total NSFNET backbone load from all traffic\n\
    \   sources that month was approximately 5 billion packets.  Therefore,\n   the\
    \ traffic from our measurement study amounted to less than .5% of\n   this volume\
    \ on the day that the measurements were collected.  Since\n   the Internet contains\
    \ several other backbones besides NSFNET, the\n   proportionate increase in total\
    \ Internet traffic was significantly\n   less than .5%.\n   The cost to a remote\
    \ site being measured is effectively zero.  From\n   the above measurements, on\
    \ average we attempted 5.7 connections per\n   remote domain.  The cost of a connection\
    \ open/close sequence is quite\n   small, particularly when compared to the cost\
    \ of the many electronic\n   mail and news transmissions that most sites experience\
    \ on a given\n   day.\n"
- title: Control Over Measurement Collection Process
  contents:
  - "Control Over Measurement Collection Process\n   The measurement software evolved\
    \ from an earlier set of experiments\n   used to measure the reach of an experimental\
    \ Internet white pages\n   tool called netfind [Schwartz & Tsirigotis 1991b],\
    \ and has been\n   evolved and tested extensively over a period of two years.\
    \  During\n   this time it has been used in a number of experiments of increasing\n\
    \   scale.  The software uses several redundant checks and other\n   mechanisms\
    \ to ensure that careful control is maintained over the\n   network operations\
    \ that are performed [Schwartz & Tsirigotis 1991a].\n   In addition, we monitor\
    \ the progress and network loading of the\n   measurements during the measurement\
    \ runs, observing the log of\n   connection requests in progress as well as physical\
    \ and transport\n   level network status (which indicate the amount of concurrent\
    \ network\n   activity in progress).  Finally, because the measurements are\n\
    \   controlled from a single centralized location, it is quite easy to\n   stop\
    \ the measurements at any time.\n"
- title: Network Appropriate Use and Privacy Issues
  contents:
  - "Network Appropriate Use and Privacy Issues\n   When we performed our initial\
    \ test runs of this study, we attempted\n   to inform site administrators at each\
    \ study site about this study, by\n   posting a message on the USENET newsgroup\
    \ \"alt.security\" and by\n   sending individual electronic mail messages to site\
    \ administrators.\n   We also informed the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)\
    \ at CMU\n   of the study.  As a practical matter, informing all sites turned\
    \ out\n   to be quite difficult.  Part of the problem was that no channels\n \
    \  exist to allow such information to be easily disseminated.\n   Approximately\
    \ half of the messages we sent to site administrators\n   were returned by remote\
    \ mail systems as undeliverable.  Moreover, the\n   network traffic and remote\
    \ site administrative load caused by the\n   study announcement messages far outstripped\
    \ the network and\n   administrative load required by the study itself.  Some\
    \ sites felt\n   that the announcement was an unnecessary imposition of their\
    \ time.\n   In addition to these practical problems, a broad announcement of this\n\
    \   study could affect the measurements it attempts to gather.  Some\n   sites\
    \ would likely react to the announcement by changing the\n   reachability of their\
    \ services.  Asking for explicit permission from\n   sites would yield even worse\
    \ methodological problems, as this would\n   have provided a self-selected study\
    \ group consisting of sites that\n   are less likely to disconnect from the Internet.\n\
    \   In contrast with our attempts to announce the study, running the\n   study\
    \ without announcing it caused only a small number of site\n   administrators\
    \ to notice the traffic and inquire about it to either\n   the CERT or to one\
    \ of the responsible network contacts at the\n   University of Colorado.  The\
    \ remote site administrator and network\n   overhead of announcing the the study,\
    \ coupled with the practical and\n   methodological problems of announcing the\
    \ study, lead us to prefer to\n   run the study without further broad announcements.\
    \  Yet, to avoid\n   causing alarm at a site detecting our network measurement\
    \ activity,\n   it makes sense to announce the study.\n   To resolve this problem,\
    \ we discussed the study with the Internet\n   Activities Board, Internet Engineering\
    \ Steering Group, National\n   Science Foundation, representatives of several\
    \ U.S.  regional\n   networks, and a number of individuals involved with network\
    \ security,\n   including the Computer Emergency Response Team, members of the\n\
    \   Internet Engineering Task Force Security and Advisory Group, and a\n   member\
    \ of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Computer\n   Incident Advisory\
    \ Capability.  The first part of our efforts resulted\n   in the production of\
    \ Internet Request For Comments (RFC) number 1262\n   [Cerf 1991].  Beyond this,\
    \ we have agreed that the appropriate action\n   at this point is to announce\
    \ the study well ahead of running it via\n   the current RFC, augmented with an\
    \ electronic posting that briefly\n   describes the study goals and methodology\
    \ and points to this RFC.\n   That announcement will be posted to the Internet\
    \ Engineering Task\n   Force mailing list, the comp.protocols.tcp-ip USENET bulletin\
    \ board,\n   and the Computer Emergency Response Team's cert-tools mailing list.\n\
    \   Moreover, in case a site misses these announcements, we will run the\n   measurement\
    \ software in a fashion intended to minimize the effort a\n   site administrator\
    \ might expend to determine the nature of the\n   activity after detecting it.\
    \  In particular, we will run the program\n   from an account called \"testnet\"\
    \ on a machine with few other users\n   logged in.  \"Fingering\" [Zimmerman 1990]\
    \ this machine will indicate\n   the testnet login.  \"Fingering\" the testnet\
    \ login will return\n   information about this study.\n   The data collected by\
    \ this study is somewhat sensitive to privacy and\n   security concerns, in the\
    \ sense that it might be used as a \"road map\"\n   of accessible network services.\
    \  We will treat the raw data as\n   private information, publishing measurements\
    \ only in global\n   statistical terms, divorced from the actual sites that make\
    \ up the\n   underlying data points.  We previously carried out a study with much\n\
    \   larger privacy implications than the current study [Schwartz & Wood\n   1991],\
    \ and successfully masked the data to protect individual\n   privacy.\n"
