  - "Abstract\n   The IAB suggests that while RFC 1597 establishes reserved IP address\n\
    \   space for the use of private networks which are isolated and will\n   remain\
    \ isolated from the Internet, any enterprise which anticipates\n   external connectivity\
    \ to the Internet should apply for a globally\n   unique address from an Internet\
    \ registry or service provider.\n"
- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   With the advent of RFC 1466 and RFC 1597 the criteria for the\n\
    \   allocation of unique IP numbers and the reservation of unique IP\n   numbers\
    \ have been defined. The IAB and the IANA wish to offer\n   guidance to the Internet\
    \ registries as to the application of these\n   two documents.  The author submits\
    \ this document as an informational\n   RFC on behalf of the Internet Architecture\
    \ Board and the IANA.\n"
- title: Guidance to Internet Registries
  contents:
  - "Guidance to Internet Registries\n   RFC 1466 lists the criteria to which Internet\
    \ registries should\n   conform.  One of the criteria is that the Internet registry\
    \ is\n   committed to allocate IP numbers according to the guidelines\n   established\
    \ by the IANA and the IR. Those guidelines (for Classes A,\n   B, and C addresses)\
    \ are documented in RFC 1466.\n   Internet Registries have agreed to comply with\
    \ the guidelines\n   established by RFC 1466 and therefore, if an organization\
    \ meets the\n   size requirement for the requested address(es) and submits an\n\
    \   engineering plan, the organization has fulfilled the necessary\n   requirements.\
    \  The Internet Registry will make the allocation based\n   on the established\
    \ criteria.\n   The preconditions defined in RFC 1466 are limited to number of\
    \ hosts\n   and subnets as well as an engineering plan.  The existence of private\n\
    \   address space (RFC 1597) shall not prevent an enterprise from\n   obtaining\
    \ public address space according to the allocation criteria\n   (currently, RFC\
    \ 1466).\n   An enterprise may be required by a Internet registry to submit an\n\
    \   engineering plan documenting a realistic deployment schedule and\n   reasonable\
    \ attention to conservation of address space to support the\n   size of the enterprise's\
    \ request for globally unique IP addresses.\n   It is perfectly appropriate for\
    \ an Internet registry to inform an\n   organization of the provisions of RFC\
    \ 1597.  Any organization\n   considering the use of private network numbers should\
    \ carefully\n   consider the potential advantages and possible problems as discussed\n\
    \   in RFCs 1597 and 1627.\n   RFC 1597 establishes reserved IP address space\
    \ for the use of private\n   networks which are isolated and will remain isolated\
    \ from the\n   Internet. Thus RFC 1597 documents a way that private enterprises\
    \ may\n   assure that their networks will remain segregated from the Internet.\n\
    \   The addresses designated in RFC 1597 should not be routed by the\n   Internet.\n\
    \   Any enterprise with a significantly large number of hosts which might\n  \
    \ require external connectivity to the Internet at the IP layer should\n   apply\
    \ for a block of globally unique addresses from an Internet\n   registry.  Enterprises\
    \ with a small to medium number of hosts that\n   require external connectivity\
    \ to the Internet at the IP layer should\n   expect to use globally unique addresses\
    \ for these hosts, assigned to\n   them by their current Internet service provider\
    \ from its own assigned\n   addresses, if it has such addresses to distribute.\n\
    \   If an enterprise with a small to medium number of hosts desires\n   unique\
    \ IP addresses, and is unable to obtain them under reasonable\n   conditions from\
    \ a service provider, or has no service provider, the\n   Internet registries\
    \ are recommended to assign such addresses without\n   conditions with respect\
    \ to service provider selection.  The\n   registries should make clear to the\
    \ enterprise that when the\n   enterprise decides to connect to the Internet,\
    \ the assigned addresses\n   are no guarantee of Internet-wide IP connectivity.\
    \ In fact, some\n   service providers may require renumbering as a condition of\n\
    \   connectivity.\n   Any organization which anticipates having external connectivity\
    \ is\n   encouraged to apply for a globally unique IP address.  Globally\n   unique\
    \ addresses are necessary to differentiate between destinations\n   on the Internet.\
    \  One must understand, however, that the globally\n   unique address by itself\
    \ does not necessarily guarantee global\n   connectivity.  Individual network\
    \ service providers may place\n   restrictions on what addresses they will or\
    \ will not route based on\n   operational limitations.\n"
