Abstract This document requests IANA to deprecate the following BGP path attributes: DPA, ADVERTISER, and RCID PATH
/ CLUSTER ID, associated with an abandoned Internet Draft and a Historic RFC.
As of this writing, the BGP Path Attributes registry maintained by IANA contains entries for DPA, ADVERTISER, and RCID PATH / CLUSTER ID.
The first of these is associated with [BGPDPA], an Internet Draft that was abandoned in 1996.
The latter are associated with [RFC1863], an RFC that was reclassified as Historic by [RFC4223] in 2005.
Neither specification is currently in use, nor have they ever been.
Note that the deprecated CLUSTER ID is distinct from CLUSTER LIST [RFC4456].
CLUSTER LIST is not being deprecated.
IANA Considerations Per this document, IANA has marked the BGP Path Attributes registry entries for DPA (Value 11), ADVERTISER (Value 12), and RCID PATH / CLUSTER ID (Value 13) as "deprecated".
There are no meaningful security consequences arising from this registry update.
