- title: 2. Brief Description of Example SPIRITS Services
  contents:
  - "2. Brief Description of Example SPIRITS Services\n   To illustrate the motivation\
    \ for the overall SPIRIT architecture,\n   this section provides a brief description\
    \ of the example SPIRITS\n   services:\n   +  Internet Call Waiting (ICW),\n \
    \  +  Internet Caller-ID Delivery, and\n   +  Internet Call Forwarding.\n   These\
    \ services are considered from the end-user point of view under\n   the assumptions\
    \ below:\n   +  Service subscription (or cancellation) is a separate process and\n\
    \      may be done over the telephone, via postal mail, or over the Web.\n   +\
    \  The subscriber's IP host (e.g., a PC) is loaded with the necessary\n      software\
    \ [including a Personal Identification Number (PIN) and the\n      IP addresses\
    \ of the SPIRITS servers] for realizing the SPIRITS\n      services.  The software\
    \ may be sent by postal mail or downloaded\n      from the Web.\n   +  The subscriber\
    \ activates a SPIRITS service by an act of service\n      session registration,\
    \ which can take place anytime after he (or\n      she) is connected to the Internet.\
    \  The subscriber may specify the\n      life span of the session.  As soon as\
    \ the session ends, the\n      SPIRITS service is deactivated.  Naturally, the\
    \ subscriber should\n      also be able to deactivate a SPIRITS service anytime\
    \ during the\n      service session.\n   For certain services (such as ICW or\
    \ Caller-ID Delivery) the\n   assumption is that the service subscriber has a\
    \ single telephone line\n   and a PC, which is connected to the Internet via this\
    \ telephone.\n   (Only under this assumption these services make sense.)\n   Nevertheless,\
    \ in other services (such as Web-based Call Center, in\n   which a call center\
    \ assistant could re-direct or reject a call\n   presented in a pop-up window)\
    \ this assumption may be unnecessary or\n   even inapplicable.\n"
- title: 2.1 Internet Call Waiting (ICW)
  contents:
  - "2.1 Internet Call Waiting (ICW)\n   The Internet call waiting service enables\
    \ a subscriber engaged in an\n   Internet dial-up session to\n      o  be notified\
    \ of an incoming call to the very same telephone line\n         that is being\
    \ used for the Internet connection;\n      o  specify the desirable treatment\
    \ of the call; and\n      o  have the call handled as specified.\n   The details\
    \ of the ICW service lie in the ways that a waiting call\n   can be treated [1].\
    \  Typical ways for handling a call include:\n   +  Accept the incoming call over\
    \ the PSTN by terminating the Internet\n      connection.  (As switching cannot\
    \ be done immediately, the caller\n      may hear an opening announcement followed\
    \ by the \"ringing\" tone.)\n   +  Forward the incoming call to another telephone\
    \ number.  The\n      subscriber will remain connected to the Internet, while\
    \ the caller\n      will hear an announcement indicating the call is being forwarded\n\
    \      and eventually be connected to the new destination number.\n   +  Accept\
    \ the incoming call by voice over IP.  The subscriber will\n      answer the incoming\
    \ call via the already established Internet\n      connection.  (The proposed\
    \ SPIRITS architecture, however, does not\n      reflect this feature.)\n   +\
    \  Redirect the incoming call to voice mail.  The subscriber will\n      remain\
    \ connected to the Internet, while the caller will hear an\n      announcement\
    \ inviting him (or her) to leave a message.\n   +  Play a pre-recorded message\
    \ to the calling party and disconnect\n      the call.  The subscriber will remain\
    \ connected to the Internet.\n   +  Reject the incoming call.  The subscriber\
    \ will remain connected to\n      the Internet, while the caller will hear an\
    \ announcement rejecting\n      the call.\n   The subscriber may specify the call\
    \ treatment on the fly when\n   notified of an incoming call.  Alternatively,\
    \ the subscriber may\n   specify a priori a general treatment for all calls (e.g.,\
    \ re-directed\n   to voice mail) or call treatments tailored to the origination\n\
    \   numbers.  As a result, when a call comes in, the subscriber won't be\n   presented\
    \ the call but can examine afterwards the treatment and\n   outcome of the call\
    \ from the log that is kept for all the calls\n   processed during the ICW service.\
    \  Typical information recorded in\n   the log includes the incoming call date\
    \ and time, calling party\n   number, calling party name, and call disposition.\n"
- title: 2.2 Internet Caller-ID Delivery
  contents:
  - "2.2 Internet Caller-ID Delivery\n   This service allows the subscriber to see\
    \ the caller's number or name\n   or both while being connected to the Internet.\
    \  If the subscriber has\n   only one telephone line and is using the very line\
    \ for the Internet\n   connection, the service is a subset of the ICW service\
    \ and follows\n   the relevant description in Section 2.1.  Otherwise, the subscriber's\n\
    \   IP host serves as an auxiliary device of the telephone to which the\n   call\
    \ is first sent.\n"
- title: 2.3 Internet Call Forwarding
  contents:
  - "2.3 Internet Call Forwarding\n   The Internet call forwarding service allows\
    \ a service subscriber to\n   forward an incoming call to another telephone number\
    \ while being\n   connected to the Internet.  If the subscriber has only one telephone\n\
    \   line and is using the very line for the Internet connection, the\n   service\
    \ is a subset of the ICW service and follows the relevant\n   description in Section\
    \ 2.1.  Otherwise, the subscriber's IP host\n   serves as an auxiliary device\
    \ of the telephone to which the call is\n   first sent.\n"
- title: 3. SPIRITS Architecture
  contents:
  - "3. SPIRITS Architecture\n   Figure 1 of the Appendix depicts the SPIRITS architecture,\
    \ which\n   includes the following entities:\n   1. Service Control Function (SCF)\
    \ [2], which executes service logic,\n      interacts with the entities in the\
    \ IP domain (e.g., the SPIRITS\n      Gateway and PINT Server) through the SPIRITS\
    \ Client, and instructs\n      the switches on how to complete a call.  Physically,\
    \ the SCF may\n      be located in either stand-alone general-purpose computers\
    \ called\n      Service Control Points (SCPs) or specialized pieces of equipment\n\
    \      called Service Nodes (SNs) [2].\n   2. Service Switching Function (SSF)\
    \ [2], which normally resides in a\n      switch and is responsible for the recognition\
    \ of Intelligent\n      Network (IN) triggers and interactions with the SCF.\n\
    \   3. SPIRITS Client, which is responsible for receiving PSTN requests\n    \
    \  from the SCF as well as sending responses back.  It may be co-\n      located\
    \ with the SCF.  If not, it communicates with the SCF over\n      the D interface.\n\
    \   4. PINT Server, which receives PINT requests from the PINT Client and\n  \
    \    relays them to the PSTN for execution over the E interface.\n   5. SPIRITS\
    \ Gateway, which is co-located with the PINT Server or PINT\n      Gateway (or\
    \ both when they are co-located as assumed here for\n      simplicity) and serves\
    \ as an intermediary between the SPIRITS\n      Server and SPRITS Client via the\
    \ B and C interfaces, respectively.\n   6. PINT Client, which resides in the subscriber's\
    \ IP host and is\n      responsible for initiating PINT requests, which are sent\
    \ to the\n      PINT server over the A interface.\n   7. SPIRITS Server, which\
    \ terminates PSTN requests and is responsible\n      for all interactions (e.g.,\
    \ incoming call notification and\n      relaying the call treatment) between the\
    \ subscriber and the\n      SPIRITS Gateway.\n   The rest of the Section describes\
    \ the interfaces between the entities\n   in detail.\n"
- title: 3.1 Interface A
  contents:
  - "3.1 Interface A\n   This interface is used for sending PINT requests to PINT\
    \ Server.  Its\n   principal use is for service session registration and as a\
    \ result\n   activation of a SPIRITS service (see Section 2).  In addition, this\n\
    \   interface may be used for service subscription.\n"
- title: 3.2 Interface B
  contents:
  - "3.2 Interface B\n   This interface serves two main purposes: 1) to notify the\
    \ subscriber\n   of incoming calls together with the calling number and name,\
    \ if\n   available; and 2) to send to the SPRITS Gateway the subscriber's\n  \
    \ choice of call disposition specified on the fly.\n"
- title: 3.3 Interface C
  contents:
  - "3.3 Interface C\n   This interface is used for communications between the SPIRITS\
    \ Client\n   and SPIRITS Gateway.  The SPIRITS Gateway may in turn communicate\n\
    \   with the SPIRITS Server, or may act as a virtual server, terminating\n   the\
    \ requests without sending them down to the SPIRITS Server.\n"
- title: 3.4 Interface D
  contents:
  - "3.4 Interface D\n   This interface is for communications between the SPIRITS\
    \ Client and\n   the SCF.  Specifically, from the SCF to the SPIRITS Client, the\n\
    \   parameters associated with the applicable IN triggers are sent.  From\n  \
    \ the SPIRITS Client to SCF, the subscriber's call disposition is sent.\n   The\
    \ SCF \"transforms\" the user's disposition into appropriate actions,\n   such\
    \ as playing an announcement to the caller, and resuming the\n   suspended call\
    \ processing in the SSP.\n"
- title: 3.5 Interface E
  contents:
  - "3.5 Interface E\n   This interface is for sending PINT requests to the SCF for\
    \ execution.\n"
- title: 4. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Security Considerations\n   As Figure 1 demonstrates, there are two distinct\
    \ communications\n   interfaces, B and C.  The B interface is, in general, across\
    \ the\n   public Internet and is thus most vulnerable to security attacks\n  \
    \ resulting in theft or denial of service.  The C interface, on the\n   other\
    \ hand is likely to be implemented across a service provider's\n   intranet, where\
    \ the security measures should be applied at the\n   discretion of the service\
    \ provider.  Even then, because at least one\n   IP host (the PINT gateway) is\
    \ connected to the Internet, special\n   measures (e.g., installation of firewalls,\
    \ although this particular\n   measure alone may be insufficient) need to be taken\
    \ to protect the\n   interface C and the rest of the network from security attacks.\n\
    \   The assumption that the PINT Client and SPIRITS server are co-\n   located,\
    \ dictates that the security considerations for the A and B\n   interfaces are\
    \ exactly the same.  Detailed security requirements and\n   solutions for interface\
    \ A (and, consequently, B) can be found in RFC\n   2848 [3].  In addition, security\
    \ requirements are listed in the\n   companion SPIRITS Protocol Requirements RFC.\n"
