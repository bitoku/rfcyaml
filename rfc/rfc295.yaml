- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   This is a report on the decisions reached at the protocol workshop\n\
    \   held in conjunction with the Network Working Group meeting held in\n   Cambridge\
    \ from 10 to 14 October, 1971.\n   The workshop addressed itself to protocols\
    \ of four types: IMP-Host,\n   Host-Host, Initial Connection, and Process-Process.\n"
- title: IMP-Host Protocol
  contents:
  - "IMP-Host Protocol\n   The idea of IMP provided status reports to be exchanged\
    \ via new\n   IMP-Host protocol messages was discussed and rejected because it\
    \ was\n   felt that the level of state information which could be reported was\n\
    \   not sufficient to be worth the trouble of implementing this mechanism.\n"
- title: Host-Host Protocol
  contents:
  - "Host-Host Protocol\n   The Host-Host Protocol was discussed and several problems\
    \ were brought\n   to light, among them were the following listed together with\
    \ the\n   group's recommendations.\n      The GVB - RET mechanism may prove useful\
    \ sometime in the\n      future so it will be retained though no one appears to\
    \ be\n      using it now, however spontaneous RET commands are\n      explicitly\
    \ prohibited.\n      The ECO - ERP commands are useful and should be supported,\n\
    \      but spontaneous ERP commands are explicitly prohibited.  A\n      further\
    \ restriction is that a second ECO will not be sent\n      until the first ECO\
    \ has been answered.  Note that any of\n      the following may be an answer to\
    \ an ECO: ERP, RST,\n      \"Destination dead\", or \"Incomplete Transmission\"\
    .\n      The RST - RRP commands are useful, but the proper use of\n      these\
    \ commands for determining the status of host software\n      is still open for\
    \ discussion (please direct comments to Jon\n      Postel), however spontaneous\
    \ RRP commands are explicitly\n      prohibited.\n   The problem of unmatched\
    \ CLS commands are discussed and four\n   \"solutions\" were proposed:\n     \
    \ Hold forever\n      Send a RST and clear the entry\n      Clear the entry and\
    \ possibly mess up a future connection\n      Assign socket numbers in a sequential\
    \ fashion to reduce\n      the possibility of confusion and clear the entry.\n\
    \   Note that the first two suggestions follow the protocol while the last\n \
    \  two do not.\n   The idea of flow control on the control link was suggested.\
    \  A Request\n   for Comments is to be prepared exploring this idea more fully.\n\
    \   The usefulness of the ERR command is compromised if the receiver\n   mearly\
    \ throws it out.  Thus ERR's are to be logged, if at all\n   possible, and checked\
    \ out with the sending site.\n   The NCP document should make clear the implications\
    \ of queueing or not\n   queueing STR & RTS commands.\n"
- title: Initial Connection Protocol
  contents:
  - "Initial Connection Protocol\n   The Initial Connection Protocol (ICP) was discussed\
    \ and found to be\n   satisfactory however the following points were stressed:\n\
    \     The socket number sent by the logger (S) must be in\n     agreement with\
    \ the socket numbers used in the STR & RTS\n     sent by the logger.\n     The\
    \ implications of queueing or not queueing of RTS & STR\n     commands should\
    \ be made clear in the ICP document.  This is\n     particularly important if\
    \ the user chooses the \"listen\"\n     option.\n"
- title: Telnet Protocol
  contents:
  - "Telnet Protocol\n   The Telnet committee has been reactivated to consider the\
    \ following\n   problems:\n     Clarification of the terminology half duplex,\
    \ full duplex,\n     character mode, line mode, ASCII, and echoing.\n     Clarification\
    \ of the end of line convention. Especially to\n     answer the question \"Should\
    \ there be a special end-of-line\n     character?\"\n     Clarification of the\
    \ conditions for leaving Hide-your-input mode.\n     Clarification of the operation\
    \ of Break and Synch.\n     Specification of a server-to-user Synch.\n     Clarification\
    \ of the definition of the Network Virtual Terminal.\n     Preparation of a new\
    \ document defining the Telnet protocol\n     with the above improvements.\n"

  - "The protocol workshop did agree that:\n  It is the servers option for disconnection\
    \ to imply logout\n  or not.\n  It is the servers option for logout to imply disconnection\n\
    \  or not.\n  Extra characters used locally to fill the time for format\n  effectors\
    \ to take effect should not be sent over the\n  network\n  Synch means to examine\
    \ the data stream from the current\n  point to a data mark (x'80').  If any break\
    \ type characters\n  (e.g. etx, sub, Break) are found they are to have their\n\
    \  normal effect.\n  Upper and lower case are to be available to all Telnet users.\n"
