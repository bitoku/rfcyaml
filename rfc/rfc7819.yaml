  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [RFC2131]\
    \ is used to\n   provide addressing and configuration information to IPv4 hosts.\
    \  DHCP\n   uses several identifiers that could become a source for gleaning\n\
    \   information about the IPv4 host.  This information may include device\n  \
    \ type, operating system information, location(s) that the device may\n   have\
    \ previously visited, etc.  This document discusses the various\n   identifiers\
    \ used by DHCP and the potential privacy issues [RFC6973].\n   In particular,\
    \ it takes into consideration the problem of pervasive\n   monitoring [RFC7258].\n\
    \   Future works may propose protocol changes to fix the privacy issues\n   that\
    \ have been analyzed in this document.  Those changes are out of\n   scope for\
    \ this document.\n   The primary focus of this document is around privacy considerations\n\
    \   for clients to support client mobility and connection to random\n   networks.\
    \  The privacy of DHCP servers and relay agents is considered\n   less important\
    \ as they are typically open for public services.  And,\n   it is generally assumed\
    \ that communication from relay agent to server\n   is protected from casual snooping,\
    \ as that communication occurs in\n   the provider's backbone.  Nevertheless,\
    \ the topics involving relay\n   agents and servers are explored to some degree.\
    \  However, future work\n   may want to further explore the privacy of DHCP servers\
    \ and relay\n   agents.\n"
- title: 2.  Requirements Language and Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements Language and Terminology\n   Naming conventions from [RFC2131]\
    \ and related documents are used\n   throughout this document.\n   In addition,\
    \ the following terminology is used:\n   Stable identifier  - Any property disclosed\
    \ by a DHCP client that\n           does not change over time or changes very\
    \ infrequently and is\n           unique for said client in a given context. \
    \ Examples include\n           MAC address, client-id, and a hostname.  Some identifiers\
    \ may\n           be considered stable only under certain conditions; for\n  \
    \         example, one client implementation may keep its client-id\n        \
    \   stored in stable storage, while another may generate it on\n           the\
    \ fly and use a different one after each boot.  Stable\n           identifiers\
    \ may or may not be globally unique.\n"
- title: 3.  DHCP Options Carrying Identifiers
  contents:
  - "3.  DHCP Options Carrying Identifiers\n   In DHCP, there are a few options that\
    \ contain identification\n   information or that can be used to extract identification\
    \ information\n   about the client.  This section enumerates various options and\
    \ the\n   identifiers that they convey and that can be used to disclose client\n\
    \   identification.  They are targets of various attacks that are\n   analyzed\
    \ in Section 5.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Client Identifier Option
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Client Identifier Option\n   The Client Identifier option [RFC2131] is\
    \ used to pass an explicit\n   client identifier to a DHCP server.\n   The client\
    \ identifier is an opaque key that must be unique to that\n   client within the\
    \ subnet to which the client is attached.  It\n   typically remains stable after\
    \ it has been initially generated.  It\n   may contain a hardware address, identical\
    \ to the contents of the\n   'chaddr' field, or another type of identifier, such\
    \ as a DNS name.\n   Section 9.2 of [RFC3315] specifies DUID-LLT (Link-layer plus\
    \ time) as\n   the recommended DUID (DHCP Unique Identifier) type in DHCPv6.\n\
    \   Section 6.1 of [RFC4361] introduces this concept to DHCP.  Those two\n   documents\
    \ recommend that client identifiers be generated by using the\n   permanent link-layer\
    \ address of the network interface that the client\n   is trying to configure.\
    \  [RFC4361] updates the recommendation for a\n   Client Identifier as follows:\
    \ \"[it] consists of a type field whose\n   value is normally 255, followed by\
    \ a four-byte IA_ID field, followed\n   by the DUID for the client as defined\
    \ in RFC 3315, section 9\".  This\n   does not change the lifecycle of client\
    \ identifiers.  Clients are\n   expected to generate their client identifiers\
    \ once (during first\n   operation) and store them in non-volatile storage or\
    \ use the same\n   deterministic algorithm to generate the same client identifier\
    \ values\n   again.\n   This means that typically an implementation will use the\
    \ available\n   link-layer address during its first boot.  Even if the administrator\n\
    \   enables link-layer address randomization, it is likely that it was\n   not\
    \ yet enabled during the first device boot.  Hence the original,\n   unobfuscated\
    \ link-layer address will likely end up being announced as\n   the client identifier,\
    \ even if the link-layer address has changed (or\n   even if it is being changed\
    \ on a periodic basis).  The exposure of\n   the original link-layer address in\
    \ the client identifier will also\n   undermine other privacy extensions such\
    \ as [RFC4941].\n"
- title: 3.2.  Address Fields and Options
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Address Fields and Options\n   The 'yiaddr' field [RFC2131] in a DHCP message\
    \ is used to convey an\n   allocated address from the server to the client.\n\
    \   The DHCP specification [RFC2131] provides a way to specify the client\n  \
    \ link-layer address in the DHCP message header.  A DHCP message header\n   has\
    \ 'htype' and 'chaddr' fields to specify the client link-layer\n   address type\
    \ and the link-layer address, respectively.  The 'chaddr'\n   field is used both\
    \ as a hardware address for transmission of reply\n   messages and as a client\
    \ identifier.\n   The 'requested IP address' option [RFC2131] is used by a client\
    \ to\n   suggest that a particular IP address be assigned.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Client FQDN Option
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Client FQDN Option\n   The Client Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) option\
    \ [RFC4702] is\n   used by DHCP clients and servers to exchange information about\
    \ the\n   client's FQDN and about who has the responsibility for updating the\n\
    \   DNS with the associated A and PTR RRs.\n   A client can use this option to\
    \ convey all or part of its domain name\n   to a DHCP server for the IP-address-to-FQDN\
    \ mapping.  In most cases,\n   a client sends its hostname as a hint for the server.\
    \  The DHCP\n   server may be configured to modify the supplied name or to substitute\n\
    \   a different name.  The server should send its notion of the complete\n   FQDN\
    \ for the client in the Domain Name field.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Parameter Request List Option
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Parameter Request List Option\n   The Parameter Request List option [RFC2131]\
    \ is used to inform the\n   server about options the client wants the server to\
    \ send to the\n   client.  The contents of a Parameter Request List option are\
    \ the\n   option codes of the options requested by the client.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Vendor Class and Vendor-Identifying Vendor Class Options
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Vendor Class and Vendor-Identifying Vendor Class Options\n   The Vendor\
    \ Class option [RFC2131], the Vendor-Identifying Vendor\n   Class option, and\
    \ the Vendor-Identifying Vendor Information option\n   [RFC3925] are used by the\
    \ DHCP client to identify the vendor that\n   manufactured the hardware on which\
    \ the client is running.\n   The information contained in the data area of this\
    \ option is\n   contained in one or more opaque fields that identify the details\
    \ of\n   the hardware configuration of the host on which the client is running\n\
    \   or of industry consortium compliance -- for example, the version of\n   the\
    \ operating system the client is running or the amount of memory\n   installed\
    \ on the client.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Civic Location Option
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Civic Location Option\n   DHCP servers use the Civic Location Option [RFC4776]\
    \ to deliver\n   location information (the civic and postal addresses) to DHCP\n\
    \   clients.  It may refer to three locations: the location of the DHCP\n   server,\
    \ the location of the network element believed to be closest to\n   the client,\
    \ or the location of the client, identified by the \"what\"\n   element within\
    \ the option.\n"
- title: 3.7.  Coordinate-Based Location Option
  contents:
  - "3.7.  Coordinate-Based Location Option\n   The GeoConf and GeoLoc options [RFC6225]\
    \ are used by a DHCP server to\n   provide coordinate-based geographic location\
    \ information to DHCP\n   clients.  They enable a DHCP client to obtain its geographic\n\
    \   location.\n"
- title: 3.8.  Client System Architecture Type Option
  contents:
  - "3.8.  Client System Architecture Type Option\n   The Client System Architecture\
    \ Type Option [RFC4578] is used by a\n   DHCP client to send a list of supported\
    \ architecture types to the\n   DHCP server.  It is used by clients that must\
    \ be booted using the\n   network rather than from local storage, so the server\
    \ can decide\n   which boot file should be provided to the client.\n"
- title: 3.9.  Relay Agent Information Option and Suboptions
  contents:
  - "3.9.  Relay Agent Information Option and Suboptions\n   A DHCP relay agent includes\
    \ a Relay Agent Information option[RFC3046]\n   to identify the remote host end\
    \ of the circuit.  It contains a\n   \"circuit ID\" suboption for the incoming\
    \ circuit, which is an agent-\n   local identifier of the circuit from which a\
    \ DHCP client-to-server\n   packet was received, and a \"remote ID\" suboption\
    \ that provides a\n   trusted identifier for the remote high-speed modem.\n  \
    \ Possible encoding of the \"circuit ID\" suboption includes: router\n   interface\
    \ number, switching hub port number, remote access server\n   port number, frame\
    \ relay Data Link Connection Identifier (DLCI), ATM\n   virtual circuit number,\
    \ cable data virtual circuit number, etc.\n   Possible encoding of the \"remote\
    \ ID\" suboption includes: a \"caller\n   ID\" telephone number for dial-up connection,\
    \ a \"user name\" prompted\n   for by a remote access server, a remote caller's\
    \ ATM address, a\n   \"modem ID\" of a cable data modem, the remote IP address\
    \ of a point-\n   to-point link, a remote X.25 address for X.25 connections, etc.\n\
    \   The link-selection suboption [RFC3527] is used by any DHCP relay\n   agent\
    \ that desires to specify a subnet/link for a DHCP client request\n   that it\
    \ is relaying but needs the subnet/link specification to be\n   different from\
    \ the IP address the DHCP server should use when\n   communicating with the relay\
    \ agent.  It contains an IP address that\n   can identify the client's subnet/link.\
    \  Also, assuming there is\n   knowledge of the network topology, it also reveals\
    \ client location.\n   A DHCP relay includes a Subscriber-ID option [RFC3993]\
    \ to associate\n   some provider-specific information with clients' DHCP messages\
    \ that\n   is independent of the physical network configuration through which\n\
    \   the subscriber is connected.  The \"subscriber-id\" assigned by the\n   provider\
    \ is intended to be stable as customers connect through\n   different paths and\
    \ as network changes occur.  The Subscriber-ID is\n   an ASCII string that is\
    \ assigned and configured by the network\n   provider.\n"

- title: 4.1.  DNS Updates
  contents:
  - "4.1.  DNS Updates\n   The Client FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) Option [RFC4702]\
    \ used\n   along with DNS Updates [RFC2136] defines a mechanism that allows both\n\
    \   clients and server to insert into the DNS domain information about\n   clients.\
    \  Both forward (A) and reverse (PTR) resource records can be\n   updated.  This\
    \ allows other nodes to conveniently refer to a host,\n   despite the fact that\
    \ its IP address may be changing.\n   This mechanism exposes two important pieces\
    \ of information: current\n   address (which can be mapped to current location)\
    \ and client's\n   hostname.  The stable hostname can then be used to correlate\
    \ the\n   client across different network attachments even when its IP\n   addresses\
    \ keep changing.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Allocation Strategies
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Allocation Strategies\n   A DHCP server running in typical, stateful mode\
    \ is given a task of\n   managing one or more pools of IP addresses.  When a client\
    \ requests\n   an address, the server must pick an address out of a configured\
    \ pool.\n   Depending on the server's implementation, various allocation\n   strategies\
    \ are possible.  Choices in this regard may have privacy\n   implications.  Note\
    \ that the constraints in DHCP and DHCPv6 are\n   radically different, but servers\
    \ that allow allocation strategy\n   configuration may allow configuring them\
    \ in both DHCP and DHCPv6.\n   Not every allocation strategy is equally suitable\
    \ for DHCP and for\n   DHCPv6.\n   Iterative allocation:  A server may choose\
    \ to allocate addresses one\n      by one.  That strategy has the benefit of being\
    \ very fast, thus\n      being favored in deployments that prefer performance.\
    \  However, it\n      makes the allocated addresses very predictable.  Also, since\
    \ the\n      addresses allocated tend to be clustered at the beginning of an\n\
    \      available pool, it makes scanning attacks much easier.\n   Identifier-based\
    \ allocation:  Some server implementations may choose\n      to allocate an address\
    \ that is based on one of the available\n      identifiers, e.g., client identifier\
    \ or MAC address.  It is also\n      convenient, as a returning client is very\
    \ likely to get the same\n      address.  Those properties are convenient for\
    \ system\n      administrators, so DHCP server implementers are often requested\
    \ to\n      implement it.  The downside of such an allocation is that the\n  \
    \    client has a very stable IP address.  That means that correlation\n     \
    \ of activities over time, location tracking, address scanning, and\n      OS/vendor\
    \ discovery apply.  This is certainly an issue in DHCPv6,\n      but due to a\
    \ much smaller address space it is almost never a\n      problem in DHCP.\n  \
    \ Hash allocation:  This is an extension of identifier-based\n      allocation.\
    \  Instead of using the identifier directly, it is\n      hashed first.  If the\
    \ hash is implemented correctly, it removes\n      the flaw of disclosing the\
    \ identifier, a property that eliminates\n      susceptibility to address scanning\
    \ and OS/vendor discovery.  If\n      the hash is poorly implemented (e.g., it\
    \ can be reversed), it\n      introduces no improvement over identifier-based\
    \ allocation.\n   Random allocation:  A server can pick a resource randomly out\
    \ of an\n      available pool.  This allocation scheme essentially prevents\n\
    \      returning clients from getting the same address again.  On the\n      other\
    \ hand, it is beneficial from a privacy perspective as\n      addresses generated\
    \ that way are not susceptible to correlation\n      attacks, OS/vendor discovery\
    \ attacks, or identity discovery\n      attacks.  Note that even though the address\
    \ itself may be\n      resilient to a given attack, the client may still be susceptible\n\
    \      if additional information is disclosed in another way, e.g., the\n    \
    \  client's address may be randomized, but it still can leak its MAC\n      address\
    \ in the Client Identifier option.\n   Other allocation strategies may be implemented.\n\
    \   Given the limited size of most IPv4 public address pools, allocation\n   mechanisms\
    \ in IPv4 may not provide much privacy protection or leak\n   much useful information,\
    \ if misused.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.6.  Pervasive Monitoring\n   Pervasive monitoring [RFC7258] is widespread (and\
    \ often covert)\n   surveillance through intrusive gathering of protocol artifacts,\n\
    \   including application content, or protocol metadata such as headers.\n   An\
    \ operator who controls a nontrivial number of access points or\n   network segments\
    \ may use obtained information about a single client\n   and observe the client's\
    \ habits.  Although users may not expect true\n   privacy from their operators,\
    \ the information that is set up to be\n   monitored by users' service operators\
    \ may also be gathered by an\n   adversary who monitors a wide range of networks\
    \ and develops\n   correlations from that information.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.7.  Finding Client's IP Address or Hostname\n   Many DHCP deployments use DNS\
    \ Updates [RFC4702] that put a client's\n   information (current IP address, client's\
    \ hostname) into the DNS,\n   where it is easily accessible by anyone interested.\
    \  Client ID is\n   also disclosed, albeit not in an easily accessible form (SHA-256\n\
    \   digest of the client-id).  As SHA-256 is considered irreversible,\n   DHCP\
    \ client ID can't be converted back to client-id.  However,\n   SHA-256 digest\
    \ can be used as a unique identifier that is accessible\n   by any host.\n"
- title: 5.8.  Correlation of Activities over Time
  contents:
  - "5.8.  Correlation of Activities over Time\n   As with other identifiers, an IP\
    \ address can be used to correlate the\n   activities of a host for at least as\
    \ long as the lifetime of the\n   address.  If that address was generated from\
    \ some other, stable\n   identifier and that generation scheme can be deduced\
    \ by an attacker,\n   the duration of the correlation attack extends to that of\
    \ the\n   identifier.  In many cases, its lifetime is equal to the lifetime of\n\
    \   the device itself.\n"
- title: 5.9.  Location Tracking
  contents:
  - "5.9.  Location Tracking\n   If a stable identifier is used for assigning an address\
    \ and such\n   mapping is discovered by an attacker, it can be used for tracking\
    \ a\n   user.  In particular, both passive (a service that the client\n   connects\
    \ to can log the client's address and draw conclusions\n   regarding its location\
    \ and movement patterns based on the addresses\n   it is connecting from) and\
    \ active (an attacker can send ICMP echo\n   requests or other probe packets to\
    \ networks of suspected client\n   locations) methods can be used.  To give a\
    \ specific example, by\n   accessing a social portal from\n   tomek-laptop.coffee.somecity.com.example,\n\
    \   tomek-laptop.mycompany.com.example, and\n   tomek-laptop.myisp.example.com,\
    \ the portal administrator can draw\n   conclusions about tomek-laptop's owner's\
    \ current location and his\n   habits.\n"
- title: 5.10.  Leasequery and Bulk Leasequery
  contents:
  - "5.10.  Leasequery and Bulk Leasequery\n   Attackers may pretend to be an access\
    \ concentrator, either as a DHCP\n   relay agent or as a DHCP client, to obtain\
    \ location information\n   directly from the DHCP server(s) using the DHCP leasequery\
    \ [RFC4388]\n   mechanism.\n   Location information is information needed by the\
    \ access concentrator\n   to forward traffic to a broadband-accessible host. \
    \ This information\n   includes knowledge of the host hardware address, the port\
    \ or virtual\n   circuit that leads to the host, and/or the hardware address of\
    \ the\n   intervening subscriber modem.\n   Furthermore, the attackers may use\
    \ the DHCP bulk leasequery [RFC6926]\n   mechanism to obtain bulk information\
    \ about DHCP bindings, even\n   without knowing the target bindings.\n   Additionally,\
    \ active leasequery [RFC7724] is a mechanism for\n   subscribing to DHCP lease\
    \ update changes in near real-time.  The\n   intent of this mechanism is to update\
    \ an operator's database;\n   however, if the mechanism is misused, an attacker\
    \ could defeat the\n   server's authentication mechanisms and subscribe to all\
    \ updates.  He\n   then could continue receiving updates, without any need for\
    \ local\n   presence.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   In current practice, the client privacy and client\
    \ authentication are\n   mutually exclusive.  The client authentication procedure\
    \ reveals\n   additional client information in the certificates and identifiers.\n\
    \   Full privacy for the clients may mean the clients are also anonymous\n   to\
    \ the server and the network.\n"
