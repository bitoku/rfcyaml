  - "Purpose:\n   This Request for Comments records an agreement between SUN\n   Microsystems,\
    \ Inc. and the Internet Society to permit the flow of\n   SUN's Open Network Computing\
    \ Remote Procedure Call and External Data\n   Representation specifications into\
    \ the Internet Standards process\n   conducted by the Internet Engineering Task\
    \ Force.  It should be noted\n   by readers that paragraph 4 means, in part, that\
    \ someone or some\n   organization other than the named \"Licensees\" must be\
    \ separately\n   \"licensed\" to make use of these specifications for implementation\
    \ or\n   other purposes.  SUN Microsystems commits to providing such a license\n\
    \   under \"substantially similar terms\" and at no charge.  If the\n   referenced\
    \ RFCs are re-issued as Proposed Standards, SUN could offer\n   a blanket license\
    \ to implementors which could, itself, be documented\n   and recorded as an RFC\
    \ for reference.\n                AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN\n                THE INTERNET\
    \ SOCIETY\n                      AND\n                SUN MICROSYSTEMS, INC.\n\
    \                 IN THE MATTER OF\n              ONC RPC AND XDR PROTOCOLS\n\
    \   1. For good and valuable consideration, receipt and sufficiency of\n   which\
    \ is hereby acknowledged, Sun Microsystems, Inc. (\"Donor\") hereby\n   grants\
    \ to the Internet Society and the Internet Engineering Task\n   Force, their officers,\
    \ employees, the IETF Secretariat and\n   contractors (\"Licensees\") for the\
    \ sole purpose of making Donor's Open\n   Network Computing (\"ONC\") Remote Procedure\
    \ Call (\"RPC\") and External\n   Data Representation (\"XDR\") (together the\
    \ \"Technology\", which is the\n   technical specifications set forth in Exhibit\
    \ \"A\" attached hereto\n   [sic] and incorporated herein by reference) an Internet\
    \ standard,\n   entering the Internet Standard process as a Proposed Standard,\
    \ a\n   cost-free, perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide right and license\n   under\
    \ any copyrights, patents or other rights in Donor's Technology\n   to use, reproduce,\
    \ modify, distribute, propose, test, develop,\n   analyze, enhance, revise, adopt,\
    \ maintain, perform and display\n   publicly, and prepare derivative works that\
    \ are based on or\n   incorporate all or part of the Technology, and to reproduce,\n\
    \   distribute and perform or display publicly any such derivative works,\n  \
    \ in any form and in all languages (computer and foreign), including\n   the right\
    \ and license to use the marks \"ONC RPC\" and \"ONC XDR\"\n   (\"Marks\") in\
    \ association therewith, and to authorize others to do so.\n   Donor agrees to\
    \ permit Licensees to use Donor's name and address to\n   indicate the original\
    \ source of the Technology.\n   2. Donor further exclusively transfers to Licensees\
    \ the worldwide\n   right and license to further evolve, develop and modify the\n\
    \   Technology for the purpose of making the Technology an Internet\n   Standard\
    \ through the Internet Standardization Process (as specified\n   in RFC 1602),\
    \ including the right and license to use the Marks in\n   association with any\
    \ such modifications, and to authorize others to\n   do so. In particular, Donor\
    \ acknowledges that if it performs any\n   evolution, development and modification\
    \ of the Technology outside of\n   the Internet Standardization Process, that\
    \ this should be clearly\n   indicated as being a non-standard development, and\
    \ that no reference\n   to the Internet Standards Process is allowed for any such\
    \ Technology\n   developed outside of the Internet Standards Process.\n   3. Donor\
    \ hereby acknowledges that Licensees assumes no obligation to\n   maintain any\
    \ confidentiality with respect to the Technology licensed\n   hereunder, and Donor\
    \ represents that, to the best of its knowledge,\n   there are no infringement\
    \ claims against the Technology. Donor\n   represents that the Technology was\
    \ not prepared jointly with others.\n   Licensees acknowledge that any rights\
    \ not expressly granted herein\n   are reserved by Donor.\n   4. Donor hereby\
    \ acknowledges that Licensees have no duty to publish\n   or otherwise use or\
    \ disseminate the Technology, including, in\n   particular, an obligation to raise\
    \ the Technology to the Internet\n   standards-track.  In the event the Technology\
    \ is elevated to Proposed\n   standard level, Donor hereby agrees to license the\
    \ Technology to\n   others under substantially similar terms as those licensed\
    \ to\n   Licensee herein at no charge (with the exception that such use of the\n\
    \   Technology by such Licensees shall be for purposes other than making\n   the\
    \ Technology an Internet Standard), so long as such licensees of\n   the Technology\
    \ implement the Internet standard.  In the event the\n   Technology is not elevated\
    \ to Proposed standard level within 24\n   months of the execution of this agreement,\
    \ then Section 2 of this\n   agreement is null and void.\n   5. THE TECHNOLOGY\
    \ IS PROVIDED TO LICENSEES \"AS IS\", AND ALL\n   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES,\
    \ EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING FITNESS\n   FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. MERCHANTABILITY\
    \ AND NONINFRINGEMENT ARE\n   HEREBY DISCLAIMED.\n   6. IN NO EVENT WILL DONOR\
    \ BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR\n   DATA, OR FOR DIRECT, SPECIAL,\
    \ INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\n   PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED\
    \ AND REGARDLESS OF THEORY OF\n   LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY\
    \ TO USE THE TECHNOLOGY,\n   EVEN IF DONOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\
    \ OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   7. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between\
    \ the\n   parties concerning its subject matter, and supersedes all prior\n  \
    \ written or oral agreements and discussions. All additions or\n   modifications\
    \ to this agreement must be made in writing and must be\n   signed by an authorized\
    \ representative of each party.  If any term or\n   condition of this Agreement\
    \ is declared void or unenforceable as\n   provided herein or by a court of competent\
    \ jurisdiction, the\n   remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.\
    \ The\n   parties agree to comply strictly with all applicable export control\n\
    \   laws and regulations.  Where no U.S.  Federal law governs, this\n   agreement\
    \ will be governed by the law of the State of California\n   without reference\
    \ to its conflict of laws provision.\n"
