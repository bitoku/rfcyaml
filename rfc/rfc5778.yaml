  - "1.  Introduction\n   Performing the Mobile IPv6 protocol [RFC3775] requires the\
    \ mobile\n   node (MN) to own a home address and to have an assigned home agent\n\
    \   (HA) to the MN.  The MN needs to register with the HA in order to\n   enable\
    \ its reachability and mobility, when away from its home link.\n   The registration\
    \ process itself may require an establishment of IPsec\n   security associations\
    \ (SAs) and cryptographic material between the MN\n   and the HA.  Alternatively,\
    \ the registration process may be secured\n   using a mobility message authentication\
    \ option, which enables IPv6\n   mobility in an MN without having to establish\
    \ an IPsec SA with its\n   HA.  Providing the collection of home address, HA address,\
    \ and keying\n   material is generally referred to as the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping\n\
    \   problem [RFC4640].  The purpose of this specification is to provide\n   Diameter\
    \ support for the interaction between the HA and the\n   Authentication, Authorization,\
    \ and Accounting (AAA) server.  This\n   specification satisfies the requirements\
    \ defined in [RFC5637] for the\n   bootstrapping problem in the split scenario\
    \ [RFC5026] and also\n   specifies Diameter support for the Authentication Protocol\
    \ for Mobile\n   IPv6 [RFC4285].  The Diameter support defined in this specification\n\
    \   also applies to Dual Stack Mobile IPv6 [RFC5555].\n   From a Mobility Service\
    \ Provider (MSP) perspective, it is important\n   to verify that the MN is authenticated\
    \ and authorized to utilize\n   Mobile IPv6 service, and is accounted for those.\
    \  Only when the MN is\n   authenticated and authorized does the MSP allow the\
    \ bootstrapping of\n   Mobile IPv6 parameters.  Thus, prior to processing the\
    \ Mobile IPv6\n   registrations, the HA participates in the authentication of\
    \ the MN to\n   verify the MN's identity.  The HA also participates in the Mobile\n\
    \   IPv6 authorization process involving the Diameter infrastructure.\n   The\
    \ HA, due to its role in traffic forwarding, may also perform\n   accounting for\
    \ the Mobile IPv6 service provided to the MN.\n   This document enables the following\
    \ functionality:\n   Authentication:  The MN's identity needs to be verified.\
    \  As a\n      Diameter client supporting the new Diameter Mobile IPv6\n     \
    \ application, the HA may need to support more than one\n      authentication\
    \ type depending on the environment.  Although the\n      authentication is performed\
    \ by the AAA server, there is an impact\n      for the HA as different sets of\
    \ command codes are needed for the\n      respective authentication procedures.\n\
    \   Authorization:  The HA must verify that the user is authorized to the\n  \
    \    Mobile IPv6 service using the assistance of the MSP Diameter\n      servers.\
    \  This is accomplished through the use of new Diameter\n      applications specifically\
    \ designed for performing Mobile IPv6\n      authorization decisions.  This document\
    \ defines required AAA\n      procedures and requires the HA to support them and\
    \ to participate\n      in this authorization signaling.\n   Accounting:  For\
    \ accounting purposes and capacity planning, it is\n      required that the HA\
    \ provides accounting reports to the Diameter\n      infrastructure and thus supports\
    \ the related Diameter accounting\n      procedures.\n   Session Management: \
    \ The management of the mobility services may\n      require the Diameter server\
    \ or the HA to terminate the Mobile IPv6\n      service before the binding expires.\
    \  This document defines\n      procedures for the AAA-based session management.\n\
    \   Figure 1 depicts the reference architecture for this document.\n         \

    \            Figure 1: Architecture Overview\n   Mobile IPv6 signaling between\
    \ the MN and the HA can be protected\n   using two different mechanisms, namely,\
    \ using IPsec or the\n   Authentication Protocol for Mobile IPv6 [RFC4285].  For\
    \ these two\n   approaches, several different authentication and key exchange\n\
    \   solutions are available.  When IPsec is used to protect Mobile IPv6\n   signaling\
    \ messages, Internet Key Exchange v2 (IKEv2) is used\n   [RFC4877] for the setup\
    \ of the IPsec SAs.  IKEv2 supports EAP-based\n   (Extensible Authentication Protocol)\
    \ initiator authentication,\n   certificates, and pre-shared secrets.  Alternatively,\
    \ the\n   Authentication Protocol for Mobile IPv6 uses a mechanism that is very\n\
    \   similar to the one used for protecting Mobile IPv4 signaling\n   messages.\n\
    \   The ability to use different credentials and methods to authenticate\n   the\
    \ MN has an impact on the AAA interactions between the HA (acting\n   as a Diameter\
    \ client) and the Diameter server.  This specification is\n   only limited to\
    \ the following MN authentication methods:\n   o  IKEv2 usage with EAP\n   o \
    \ Mobile IPv6 Authentication Protocol\n   New authentication mechanisms may be\
    \ added later by separate\n   specifications.\n   For accounting of Mobile IPv6\
    \ services provided to the MN, this\n   specification uses the Diameter base protocol\
    \ accounting defined in\n   [RFC3588].\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Support for Mobile IPv6 with IKEv2 and EAP\n   The use of IKEv2 with EAP\
    \ between the MN and the HA allows the AAA to\n   authenticate the MN.  When EAP\
    \ is used with IKEv2, the Diameter EAP\n   application logic and procedures, as\
    \ defined in [RFC4072], are re-\n   used.  EAP methods that do not establish a\
    \ shared key SHOULD NOT be\n   used, as they are subject to a number of man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks as\n   stated in Section 2.16 and Section 5 of [RFC4306].  Attribute-value\n\
    \   pairs (AVPs) specific to Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping are added to the\n   EAP\

    \ and EAP\n   The MN and the HA start the interaction with an IKE_SA_INIT exchange.\n\
    \   In this phase, cryptographic algorithms are negotiated, and nonces\n   and\
    \ Diffie-Hellman parameters are exchanged.  Message (3) starts the\n   IKE_AUTH\
    \ phase.  This second phase authenticates the previous\n   messages, exchanges\
    \ identities and certificates, and establishes the\n   first CHILD_SA.  It is\
    \ used to mutually authenticate the MN (acting\n   as an IKEv2 initiator) and\
    \ the HA (acting as an IKEv2 responder).\n   The identity of the user/MN is provided\
    \ in the IDi field.  The MN\n   indicates its willingness to be authenticated\
    \ via EAP by omitting the\n   AUTH field in message (3) (see Section 2.16 of [RFC4306]).\n\
    \   As part of the authentication process, the MN MAY request a home\n   address\
    \ or a home prefix or suggest one (see [RFC4877]), using a\n   CFG_REQUEST payload\
    \ in the message (3).\n   The HA extracts the IDi field from the message (3) and\
    \ sends a\n   Diameter-EAP-Request (DER) message (4) towards the authenticating\n\
    \   Diameter server.  The EAP-Payload AVP contains a EAP-Response/\n   Identity\
    \ with the identity extracted from the IDi field.\n   This message is routed to\
    \ the MN's Diameter server/EAP server.  The\n   Diameter server selects the EAP\
    \ method and replies with the Diameter-\n   EAP-Answer (DEA) message.  Depending\
    \ on the type of EAP method\n   chosen, a number of DER and DEA messages carry\
    \ the method-specific\n   exchanges between the MN and the Diameter server/EAP\
    \ server.\n   At the end of the EAP authentication phase, the Diameter server\n\
    \   indicates the result of the authentication in the Result-Code AVP and\n  \
    \ provides the corresponding EAP packet (EAP Success or EAP Failure).\n   The\
    \ last IKEv2 message sent by the HA contains the home address or\n   the home\
    \ prefix.  In the latter case, a CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange is\n   necessary to\
    \ set up IPsec SAs for Mobile IPv6 signaling.\n   In some deployment scenarios,\
    \ the HA may also act as an IKEv2\n   responder for a conventional IPsec VPN access.\
    \  The challenge in this\n   case is that the IKEv2 responder may not know if\
    \ IKEv2 is used for\n   Mobile IPv6 service or for IPsec VPN access service. \
    \ A network\n   operator needs to be aware of this limitation.  One solution already\n\
    \   supported by IKEv2 is to use different responder identities when\n   operating\
    \ as a conventional IPsec VPN gateway or as an HA.  The MN\n   can then indicate\
    \ the preferred responder type using the appropriate\n   IDr payload in the IKE_AUTH\
    \ message.\n   Eventually, when the HA receives a Binding Update (BU), the HA\n\
    \   authenticates and authorizes the MN.  It is RECOMMENDED that the HA\n   sends\
    \ an accounting request message every time it receives a BU.\n"
