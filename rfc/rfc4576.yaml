    \  issue that may arise when a Service Provider (SP) provides \"BGP/MPLS\n   IP
    VPN\" service to a customer and the customer uses OSPFv2 to\n   advertise its
    routes to the SP.  In this situation, a Customer Edge\n   (CE) Router and a Provider
    Edge (PE) Router are OSPF peers, and\n   customer routes are sent via OSPFv2 from
    the CE to the PE.  The\n   customer routes are converted into BGP routes, and
    BGP carries them\n   across the backbone to other PE routers.  The routes are
    then\n   converted back to OSPF routes sent via OSPF to other CE routers.  As\n
    \  a result of this conversion, some of the information needed to\n   prevent

    from a PE to a CE, the route will be ignored by any\n   PE that receives it back
    from a CE.  This document specifies the\n   necessary procedure, using one of

  - "1.  Introduction\n   [VPN] describes a method by which a Service Provider (SP)
    can use its\n   IP backbone to provide an \"IP VPN\" service to customers.  In
    that\n   sort of service, a customer's edge devices (CE devices) are connected\n
    \  to the provider's edge routers (PE routers).  Each CE device is in a\n   single
    Virtual Private Network (VPN).  Each PE device may attach to\n   multiple CEs
    of the same or of different VPNs.  A VPN thus consists\n   of a set of \"network
    segments\" connected by the SP's backbone.\n   A CE exchanges routes with a PE,
    using a routing protocol to which\n   the customer and the SP jointly agree.  The
    PE runs that routing\n   protocol's decision process (i.e., it performs the routing\n
    \  computation) to determine the set of IP address prefixes for which\n   the
    following two conditions hold:\n      -  Each address prefix in the set can be
    reached via that CE.\n      -  The path from that CE to each such address prefix
    does NOT\n         include the SP backbone (i.e., it does not include any PE\n
    \        routers).\n   The PE routers that attach to a particular VPN redistribute
    routes to\n   these address prefixes into BGP, so that they can use BGP to\n   distribute
    the VPN's routes to each other.  BGP carries these routes\n   in the \"VPN-IPv4
    address family\", so that they are distinct from\n   ordinary Internet routes.
    \ The VPN-IPv4 address family also extends\n   the IP addresses on the left so
    that address prefixes from two\n   different VPNs are always distinct to BGP,
    even if both VPNs use the\n   same piece of the private RFC 1918 address space.
    \ Thus, routes from\n   different VPNs can be carried by a single BGP instance
    and can be\n   stored in a common BGP table without fear of conflict.\n   If a
    PE router receives a particular VPN-IPv4 route via BGP, and if\n   that PE is
    attached to a CE in the VPN to which the route belongs,\n   then BGP's decision
    process may install that route in the BGP route\n   table.  If so, the PE translates
    the route back into an IP route and\n   redistributes it to the routing protocol
    that is running on the link\n   to that CE.\n   This methodology provides a \"peer
    model\".  CE routers peer with PE\n   routers, but CE routers at different sites
    do not peer with each\n   other.\n   If a VPN uses OSPFv2 as its internal routing
    protocol, it is not\n   necessarily the case that the CE routers of that VPN use
    OSPFv2 to\n   peer with the PE routers.  Each site in a VPN can use OSPFv2 as
    its\n   intra-site routing protocol while using BGP or RIP (for example) to\n
    \  distribute routes to a PE router.  However, it is certainly\n   convenient
    when OSPFv2 is being used intra-site to use it on the PE-\n   CE link as well,
    and [VPN] explicitly allows this.  In this case, a\n   PE will run a separate
    instance of OSPFv2 for each VPN that is\n   attached to the PE; the PE will in
    general have multiple VPN-specific\n   OSPFv2 routing tables.\n   When OSPFv2
    is used on a PE-CE link that belongs to a particular VPN,\n   the PE router must
    redistribute to that VPN's OSPFv2 instance certain\n   routes that have been installed
    in the BGP routing table.  Similarly,\n   a PE router must redistribute to BGP
    routes that have been installed\n   in the VPN-specific OSPF routing tables.  Procedures
    for this are\n   specified in [VPN-OSPF].\n   The routes that are redistributed
    from BGP to OSPFv2 are advertised\n   in LSAs that are originated by the PE.  The
    PE acts as an OSPF border\n   router, advertising some of these routes in AS-external
    LSAs, and\n   some in summary LSAs, as specified in [VPN-OSPF].\n   Similarly,
    when a PE router receives an LSA from a CE router, it runs\n   the OSPF routing
    computation.  Any route that gets installed in the\n   OSPF routing table must
    be translated into a VPN-IPv4 route and then\n   redistributed into BGP.  BGP
    will then distribute these routes to the\n   other PE routers.\n"

  title: 2.  Specification of Requirements
- contents:
  - "3.  Information Loss and Loops\n   A PE, say PE1, may learn a route to a particular
    VPN-IPv4 address\n   prefix via BGP.  This may cause it to generate a summary
    LSA or an\n   AS-external LSA in which it reports that address prefix.  This LSA\n
    \  may then be distributed to a particular CE, say CE1.  The LSA may\n   then
    be distributed throughout a particular OSPF area, reaching\n   another CE, say
    CE2.  CE2 may then distribute the LSA to another PE,\n   say PE2.\n   As stated
    in the previous section, PE2 must run the OSPF routing\n   computation to determine
    whether a particular address prefix,\n   reported in an LSA from CE2, is reachable
    from CE2 via a path that\n   does not include any PE router.  Unfortunately, there
    is no standard\n   way to do this.  The OSPFv2 LSAs do not necessarily carry the\n
    \  information needed to enable PE2 to determine that the path to\n   address
    prefix X in a particular LSA from CE2 is actually a path that\n   includes, say
    PE1.  If PE2 then leaks X into BGP as a VPN-IPv4 route,\n   then PE2 is violating
    one of the constraints for loop-freedom in BGP;\n   viz., that routes learned
    from a particular BGP domain are not\n   redistributed back into that BGP domain.
    \ This could cause a routing\n   loop to be created.\n   It is therefore necessary
    to have a means by which an LSA may carry\n   the information that a particular
    address prefix has been learned\n   from a PE router.  Any PE router that receives
    an LSA with this\n   information would omit the information in this LSA from its
    OSPF\n   routing computation, and thus it would not leak the information back\n
    \  into BGP.\n   When a PE generates an AS-external LSA, it could use a distinct
    tag\n   value to indicate that the LSA is carrying information about an\n   address
    prefix for whom the path includes a PE router.  However, this\n   method is not
    available in the case where the PE generates a Summary\n   LSA.  Per [VPN-OSPF],
    each PE router must function as an OSPF area 0\n   router.  If the PE-CE link
    is an area 0 link, then it is possible for\n   the PE to receive, over that link,
    a summary LSA that originated at\n   another PE router.  Thus, we need some way
    of marking a summary LSA\n   to indicate that it is carrying information about
    a path via a PE\n   router.\n"
  title: 3.  Information Loss and Loops

  - "4.  Using the LSA Options to Prevent Loops\n   The high-order bit of the LSA
    Options field (a previously unused bit)\n   is used to solve the problem described
    in the previous section.  We\n   refer to this bit as the DN bit.  When a type
    3, 5, or 7 LSA is sent\n   from a PE to a CE, the DN bit MUST be set.  The DN
    bit MUST be clear\n   in all other LSA types.\n                  +-------------------------------------+\n
    \                 | DN | * | DC | EA | N/P | MC | E | * |\n                  +-------------------------------------+\n
    \                        Options Field with DN Bit\n                          (RFC
    2328, Section A.2)\n   When the PE receives, from a CE router, a type 3, 5, or
    7 LSA with\n   the DN bit set, the information from that LSA MUST NOT be used
    during\n   the OSPF route calculation.  As a result, the LSA is not translated\n
    \  into a BGP route.  The DN bit MUST be ignored in all other LSA types.\n   This
    prevents routes learned via BGP from being redistributed to BGP.\n   (This restriction
    is analogous to the usual OSPF restriction that\n   inter-area routes that are
    learned from area 0 are not passed back to\n   area 0.)\n   Note that the DN bit
    has no other effect on LSA handling.  In\n   particular, an LSA with the DN bit
    set will be put in the topological\n   database, aged, flooded, etc., just as
    if DN were not set.\n"
  title: 4.  Using the LSA Options to Prevent Loops
- contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   An attacker may cause the DN bit to be set, in
    an LSA traveling from\n   CE to PE, when the DN bit should really be clear.  This
    may cause the\n   address prefixes mentioned in that LSA to be unreachable from
    other\n   sites of the VPN.  Similarly, an attacker may cause the DN bit to be\n
    \  clear, in an LSA traveling in either direction, when the DN bit\n   should
    really be set.  This may cause routing loops for traffic that\n   is destined
    to the address prefixes mentioned in that LSA.\n   These possibilities may be
    eliminated by using cryptographic\n   authentication as specified in Section D
    of [OSPFv2].\n"
