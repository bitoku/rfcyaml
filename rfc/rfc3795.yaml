  - "Abstract\n   This document describes IPv4 addressing dependencies in an attempt\
    \ to\n   clarify the necessary steps in re-designing and re-implementing\n   specifications\
    \ to become network address independent, or at least, to\n   dually support IPv4\
    \ and IPv6.  This transition requires several\n   interim steps, one of them being\
    \ the evolution of current IPv4\n   dependent specifications to a format independent\
    \ of the type of IP\n   addressing schema used.  Hence, it is hoped that specifications\
    \ will\n   be re-designed and re-implemented to become network address\n   independent,\
    \ or at least to dually support IPv4 and IPv6.\n   To achieve that step, it is\
    \ necessary to survey and document all IPv4\n   dependencies experienced by current\
    \ standards (Full, Draft, and\n   Proposed) as well as Experimental RFCs.  Hence,\
    \ this document\n   describes IPv4 addressing dependencies that deployed IETF\
    \ Application\n   Area documented Standards may experience.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The exhaustive documentation of IPv4 addresses usage in\
    \ currently\n   deployed IETF documented standards has now been broken into seven\n\
    \   documents conforming to current IETF main areas, i.e., Applications,\n   Internet,\
    \ Operations and Management, Routing, Sub-IP, and Transport.\n   A general overview\
    \ of the documentation, as well as followed\n   methodology and historical perspective\
    \ can be found in [1].  This\n   document represents one of the seven blocks,\
    \ and its scope is limited\n   to surveying possible IPv4 dependencies in IETF\
    \ Application Area\n   documented Standards.\n"
- title: 2.  Document Organization
  contents:
  - "2.  Document Organization\n   The remainder sections are organized as follows.\
    \  Sections 3, 4, 5,\n   and 6 describe, respectively, the raw analysis of Internet\
    \ Standards\n   [2]:\n   Full, Draft, and Proposed Standards, and Experimental\
    \ RFCs.  For each\n   section, standards are analysed by their RFC number, in\
    \ sequential\n   order, i.e., from RFC 1 to RFC 3200.  Exceptions to this are\
    \ some\n   RFCs above RFC 3200.  They have been included, given that they\n  \
    \ obsoleted RFCs within the range 1-3200.  Also, the comments presented\n   for\
    \ each RFC are raw in their nature, i.e., each RFC is simply\n   analysed in terms\
    \ of possible IPv4 addressing dependencies.  Finally,\n   Section 7 presents a\
    \ global overview of the data described in the\n   previous sections, and suggests\
    \ possible future steps.\n"

    \   Section 3.2.1 (Common Variables) provides the following variable\n   definitions:\n\
    \      \"Peer Address (peer.peeraddr, pkt.peeraddr), Peer Port\n      (peer.peerport,\
    \ pkt.peerport): These are the 32-bit Internet\n      address and 16-bit port\
    \ number of the peer.\n      Host Address (peer.hostaddr, pkt.hostaddr), Host\
    \ Port\n      (peer.hostport, pkt.hostport): These are the 32-bit Internet\n \
    \     address and 16-bit port number of the host.  They are included\n      among\
    \ the state variables to support multi-homing.\"\n   Section 3.4.3 (Receive Procedure)\
    \ defines the following procedure:\n      \"The source and destination Internet\
    \ addresses and ports in the IP\n      and UDP headers are matched to the correct\
    \ peer.  If there is no\n      match a new instantiation of the protocol machine\
    \ is created and\n      the association mobilized.\"\n   Section 3.6 (Access Control\
    \ Issues) proposes a simple authentication\n   scheme in the following way:\n\
    \      \"If a more comprehensive trust model is required, the design can\n   \
    \   be based on an access-control list with each entry consisting of a\n     \
    \ 32-bit Internet address, 32-bit mask and three-bit mode.  If the\n      logical\
    \ AND of the source address (pkt.peeraddr) and the mask in\n      an entry matches\
    \ the corresponding address in the entry and the\n      mode (pkt.mode) matches\
    \ the mode in the entry, the access is\n      allowed; otherwise an ICMP error\
    \ message is returned to the\n      requestor.  Through appropriate choice of\
    \ mask, it is possible to\n      restrict requests by mode to individual addresses,\
    \ a particular\n      subnet or net addresses, or have no restriction at all.\
    \  The\n      access-control list would then serve as a filter controlling which\n\
    \      peers could create associations.\"\n   Appendix B Section 3 (B.3 Commands)\
    \ defines the following command:\n      \"Set Trap Address/Port (6): The command\
    \ association identifier,\n      status and data fields are ignored.  The address\
    \ and port number\n      for subsequent trap messages are taken from the source\
    \ address and\n      port of the control message itself.  The initial trap counter\
    \ for\n      trap response messages is taken from the sequence field of the\n\
    \      command.  The response association identifier, status and data\n      fields\
    \ are not significant.  Implementations should include sanity\n      timeouts\
    \ which prevent trap transmissions if the monitoring\n      program does not renew\
    \ this information after a lengthy interval.\"\n   The address clearly assumes\
    \ the IPv4 version.  Also, there are\n   numerous places in sample code and in\
    \ algorithms that use the above\n   mentioned variables.  It seems that there\
    \ is no reason to modify the\n   actual protocol.  A small number of textual changes\
    \ and an update to\n   implementations, so they can understand both IPv4 and IPv6\
    \ addresses,\n   will suffice to have a NTP version that works on both network\
    \ layer\n   protocols.\n"

    \ servers, the\n      Directory of Services server etc.\n      A client can itself\
    \ choose for how long it should cache the\n      information.\n      The IP-address\
    \ of the Directory of Services server might not\n      change for a day or two,\
    \ and neither might any other information.\"\n   Also, subsection 4.1. (Caching\
    \ a Whois++ servers hostname) contains:\n      \"An example of cached information\
    \ that might change is the cached\n      hostname, IP-address and portnumber which\
    \ a client gets back in a\n      servers-to-ask response.  That information is\
    \ cached in the server\n      since the last poll, which might occurred several\
    \ weeks ago.\n      Therefore, when such a connection fails, the client should\
    \ fall\n      back to use the serverhandle instead, which means that it contacts\n\
    \      the Directory of Services server and queries for a server with\n      that\
    \ serverhandle.  By doing this, the client should always get\n      the last known\

    \      A <dns name> is a standard name, acceptable to the domain name\n      service.\
    \  It must be sufficiently qualified to be useful to the\n      receiver of the\

    \ to become IP-version neutral.\n   Besides adding a reference to the use of IPv6\
    \ addresses, the \"host\"\n   field should only be defined as a \"dns name\".\
    \  However, if the use of\n   literal IP addresses is to be included, the format\
    \ specified in RFC\n   2372 has to be followed.\n   Later in section 8. (TIP Uniform\
    \ Resource Locators):\n      \"A TIP URL takes the form:\n         tip://<transaction\
    \ manager address>?<transaction string>\n      where <transaction manager address>\
    \ identifies the TIP transaction\n      manager (as defined in Section 7 above);\

    \     determines the syntactic interpretation of the Namespace\n         Specific\
    \ String.  The Namespace Specific String is a sequence\n         of characters\

    \ of literal\n   IP addresses.  Therefore, this section also needs to be re-written,\n\
    \   and special care should be taken to avoid the use of IP (either IPv4\n   or\

    \ (iCalendar)\n   Section 4.8.4.7 (Unique Identifier) states:\n      \"Property\
    \ Name: UID\n      Purpose: This property defines the persistent, globally unique\n\
    \      identifier for the calendar component.\n      Value Type: TEXT\n      Property\
    \ Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be\n      specified on this\
    \ property.\n      Conformance: The property MUST be specified in the \"VEVENT\"\
    ,\n      \"VTODO\", \"VJOURNAL\" or \"VFREEBUSY\" calendar components.\n     \
    \ Description: The UID itself MUST be a globally unique identifier.\n      The\
    \ generator of the identifier MUST guarantee that the identifier\n      is unique.\
    \  There are several algorithms that can be used to\n      accomplish this.  The\
    \ identifier is RECOMMENDED to be the\n      identical syntax to the [RFC 822]\
    \ addr-spec.  A good method to\n      assure uniqueness is to put the domain name\
    \ or a domain literal IP\n      address of the host on which the identifier was\
    \ created on the\n      right hand side of the \"@\", and on the left hand side,\
    \ put a\n      combination of the current calendar date and time of day (i.e.,\n\
    \      formatted in as a DATE-TIME value) along with some other currently\n  \
    \    unique (perhaps sequential) identifier available on the system\n      (for\
    \ example, a process id number).  Using a date/time value on\n      the left hand\
    \ side and a domain name or domain literal on the\n      right hand side makes\
    \ it possible to guarantee uniqueness since no\n      two hosts should be using\
    \ the same domain name or IP address at\n      the same time.  Though other algorithms\
    \ will work, it is\n      RECOMMENDED that the right hand side contain some domain\n\
    \      identifier (either of the host itself or otherwise) such that the\n   \
    \   generator of the message identifier can guarantee the uniqueness\n      of\
    \ the left hand side within the scope of that domain.\"\n   Although the above\
    \ does not explicitly state the use of IPv4\n   addresses, it addresses the explicit\
    \ use of RFC 822 (obsoleted by RFC\n   2822).  To become IPv6 compliant it should\
    \ follow the guidelines for\n   RFC 2822 (see section 5.129).\n"

    \ the majority simply require minor actions, such\n   as adding a caveat to IPv6\
    \ addressing that would avoid ambiguity, or\n   re-writing a section to avoid\
    \ IP-version dependent syntax.  The\n   remaining instances are documented below.\
