  - "1.  Introduction\n   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945]\
    \ extends\n   MPLS from supporting Packet Switching Capable (PSC) interfaces and\n\
    \   switching to include support of four new classes of interfaces and\n   switching:\
    \ Layer-2 Switching (L2SC), Time-Division Multiplex (TDM),\n   Lambda Switch (LSC),\
    \ and Fiber-Switch (FSC) Capable.  A functional\n   description of the extensions\
    \ to MPLS signaling that are needed to\n   support these new classes of interfaces\
    \ and switching is provided in\n   [RFC3471].  [RFC3473] describes the RSVP-TE-specific\
    \ formats and\n   mechanisms needed to support all four classes of interfaces.\n\
    \   This document presents the technology details that are specific to\n   G.709\
    \ Optical Transport Networks (OTN) as specified in the ITU-T\n   G.709 recommendation\
    \ [ITUT-G709] (and referenced documents),\n   including pre-OTN developments.\
    \  Per [RFC3471], G.709 technology-\n   specific parameters are carried through\
    \ the signaling protocol in\n   dedicated traffic parameter objects.\n   The G.709\
    \ traffic parameters defined hereafter (see Section 3.2) MUST\n   be used when\
    \ the label is encoded as defined in this document.\n   Moreover, the label MUST\
    \ be encoded as defined in Section 4 when\n   these G.709 traffic parameters are\
    \ used.\n   In the context of this memo, by pre-OTN developments, one refers to\n\
    \   Optical Channel, Digital Wrapper and Forward Error Correction (FEC)\n   solutions\
    \ that are not fully G.709 compliant.  Details concerning\n   pre-OTN Synchronous\
    \ Optical Network (SONET)/Synchronous Digital\n   Hierarchy (SDH) based solutions\
    \ including Section/Regenerator Section\n   overhead (SOH/RSOH) and Line/Multiplex\
    \ Section overhead (LOH/MSOH)\n   transparency are covered in [RFC3946].\n   ***\
    \ Note on ITU-T G.709 Recommendation ***\n   The views on the ITU-T G.709 OTN\
    \ Recommendation presented in this\n   document are intentionally restricted to\
    \ the GMPLS perspective within\n   the IETF CCAMP WG context.  Hence, the objective\
    \ of this document is\n   not to replicate the content of the ITU-T OTN recommendations.\n\
    \   Therefore, readers interested in more details concerning the\n   corresponding\

- title: 2.  GMPLS Extensions for G.709 - Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  GMPLS Extensions for G.709 - Overview\n   [ITUT-G709] defines several networking\
    \ layers constituting the\n   optical transport hierarchy:\n   - with full functionality:\n\
    \     . Optical Transmission Section (OTS)\n     . Optical Multiplex Section (OMS)\n\
    \     . Optical Channel (OCh)\n   - with reduced functionality:\n     . Optical\
    \ Physical Section (OPS)\n     . Optical Channel with reduced functionality (OChr)\n\
    \   It also defines two layers constituting the digital transport\n   hierarchy:\n\
    \   - Optical Channel Transport Unit (OTUk)\n   - Optical Channel Data Unit (ODUk)\n\
    \   However, only the OCh and the ODUk layers are defined as switching\n   layers.\
    \  Both OCh (but not OChr) and ODUk layers include the overhead\n   for supervision\
    \ and management.  The OCh overhead is transported in a\n   non-associated manner\
    \ (also referred to as the non-associated\n   overhead naOH) in the Optical Transport\
    \ Module (OTM) Overhead Signal\n   (OOS), together with the OTS and OMS non-associated\
    \ overhead.  The\n   OOS is transported via a dedicated wavelength, referred to\
    \ as the\n   Optical Supervisory Channel (OSC).  It should be noticed that the\n\
    \   naOH is only functionally specified and as such, it is open to\n   vendor-specific\
    \ solutions.  The ODUk overhead is transported in an\n   associated manner as\
    \ part of the digital ODUk frame.\n   As described in [ITUT-G709], in addition\
    \ to the support of ODUk\n   mapping into OTUk (k = 1, 2, 3), G.709 supports ODUk\
    \ multiplexing.\n   It refers to the multiplexing of ODUj (j = 1, 2) into an ODUk\
    \ (k > j)\n   signal, in particular:\n     - ODU1 into ODU2 multiplexing\n   \
    \  - ODU1 into ODU3 multiplexing\n     - ODU2 into ODU3 multiplexing\n     - ODU1\
    \ and ODU2 into ODU3 multiplexing\n   Adapting GMPLS to control G.709 OTN can\
    \ be achieved by creating:\n     - a Digital Path layer, by extending the previously\
    \ defined\n       \"Digital Wrapper\" in [RFC3471] corresponding to the ODUk\n\
    \       (digital) path layer.\n     - an Optical Path layer, by extending the\
    \ \"Lambda\" concept (defined\n       in [RFC3471]) to the OCh (optical) path\
    \ layer.\n     - a label space structure, by considering a tree whose root is\
    \ an\n       OTUk signal and leaves the ODUj signals (k >= j); enabling the\n\
    \       identification of the exact position of a particular ODUj signal\n   \
    \    in an ODUk multiplexing structure.\n   Thus, the GMPLS signaling extensions\
    \ for G.709 need to cover the\n   Generalized Label Request, the Generalized Label\
    \ as well as the\n   specific technology dependent objects included in the so-called\n\
    \   traffic parameters as specified in [RFC3946] for SONET/SDH networks.\n   Moreover,\
    \ because multiplexing in the digital domain (such as ODUk\n   multiplexing) has\
    \ been specified in the amended version of the G.709\n   ITU-T recommendation\
    \ (October 2001), this document also proposes a\n   label space definition suitable\
    \ for that purpose.  Notice also that\n   one uses the G.709 ODUk (i.e., Digital\
    \ Path) and OCh (i.e., Optical\n   Path) layers directly in order to define the\
    \ corresponding label\n   spaces.\n"
- title: 3.  Generalized Label Request
  contents:
  - "3.  Generalized Label Request\n   The Generalized Label Request, as defined in\
    \ [RFC3471], includes a\n   common part (i.e., used for any switching technology)\
    \ and a\n   technology dependent part (i.e., the traffic parameters).  In this\n\
    \   section, both parts are extended to accommodate GMPLS Signaling to\n   the\
    \ G.709 transport plane recommendation (see [ITUT-G709]).\n"
- title: 3.1.  Common Part
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Common Part\n   As defined in [RFC3471], the LSP Encoding Type, the Switching\
    \ Type\n   and the Generalized Protocol Identifier (Generalized-PID) constitute\n\
    \   the common part of the Generalized Label Request.  The encoding of\n   the\
    \ RSVP-TE GENERALIZED_LABEL_REQUEST object is specified in\n   [RFC3473] Section\
    \ 2.1.\n   As mentioned above, this document extends the LSP Encoding Type, the\n\
    \   Switching Type, and G-PID (Generalized-PID) values to accommodate\n   G.709\
    \ Recommendation [ITUT-G709].\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  LSP Encoding Type
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  LSP Encoding Type\n   Because G.709 Recommendation defines two networking\
    \ layers (ODUk\n   layers and OCh layer), the LSP Encoding Type code-points can\
    \ reflect\n   these two layers defined in [RFC3471] Section 3.1 as \"Digital\n\
    \   Wrapper\" and \"Lambda\" code.  The LSP Encoding Type is specified per\n \
    \  networking layer or, more precisely, per group of functional\n   networking\
    \ layers: the ODUk layers and the OCh layer.\n   Therefore, an additional LSP\
    \ Encoding Type code-point for the G.709\n   Digital Path layer is defined; it\
    \ enlarges the existing \"Digital\n   Wrapper\" code-point defined in [RFC3471].\
    \  The former MUST be\n   generated when the interface or tunnel on which the\
    \ traffic will be\n   transmitted supports G.709 compliant Digital Path layer\
    \ encoding.\n   The latter MUST only be used for non-G.709 compliant Digital Wrapper\n\
    \   layer(s) encoding.  A transit or an egress node (receiving a Path\n   message\
    \ containing a GENERALIZED_LABEL_REQUEST object) MUST generate\n   a PathErr message,\
    \ with a \"Routing problem/Unsupported Encoding\"\n   indication, if the requested\
    \ LSP Encoding Type cannot be supported on\n   the corresponding incoming interface.\n\
    \   In the same way, an additional LSP Encoding Type code-point for the\n   G.709\
    \ Optical Channel layer is defined; it enlarges the existing\n   \"Lambda\" code-point\
    \ defined in [RFC3471].  The former MUST be\n   generated when the interface or\
    \ tunnel on which the traffic will be\n   transmitted supports G.709-compliant\
    \ Optical Channel layer encoding.\n   The latter MUST only be used for non-G.709\
    \ compliant Lambda layer(s)\n   encoding.  A transit or an egress node (receiving\
    \ a Path message that\n   contains a GENERALIZED_LABEL_REQUEST object) MUST generate\
    \ a PathErr\n   message with a \"Routing problem/Unsupported Encoding\" indication,\
    \ if\n   the requested LSP Encoding Type cannot be supported on the\n   corresponding\
    \ incoming interface.\n   Consequently, the following additional code-points for\
    \ the LSP\n   Encoding Type are defined:\n        Value           Type\n     \
    \   -----           ----\n        12             G.709 ODUk (Digital Path)\n \
    \       13             G.709 Optical Channel\n   Moreover, the code-point for\
    \ the G.709 Optical Channel (OCh) layer\n   will indicate the requested capability\
    \ of an end-system to use the\n   G.709 non-associated overhead (naOH), i.e.,\
    \ the OTM Overhead Signal\n   (OOS) multiplexed into the OTM-n.m interface signal.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  Switching Type
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Switching Type\n   The Switching Type indicates the type of switching\
    \ that should be\n   performed at the termination of a particular link (see [RFC4202]).\n\
    \   No additional Switching Type values are to be considered in order to\n   accommodate\
    \ G.709 switching types, because an ODUk switching (and\n   thus LSPs) belongs\
    \ to the TDM class, while an OCh switching (and thus\n   LSPs) belong to the Lambda\
    \ class (i.e., LSC).\n   Intermediate and egress nodes MUST verify that the value\
    \ indicated in\n   the Switching Type field is supported on the corresponding\
    \ incoming\n   interface.  If the requested value can not be supported, the node\n\
    \   MUST generate a PathErr message with a \"Routing problem/Switching\n   Type\"\
    \ indication.\n"

  - "3.1.3.  Generalized-PID (G-PID)\n   The G-PID (16 bits field), as defined in\
    \ [RFC3471], identifies the\n   payload carried by an LSP, i.e., an identifier\
    \ of the client layer of\n   that LSP.  This identifier is used by the endpoints\
    \ of the G.709 LSP.\n   The G-PID can take one of the following values when the\

    \ in an OTU1 (OTU2 or OTU3), the upstream node\n      requests results simply\
    \ in an ODU1 (ODU2 or ODU3) signal request.\n      In such conditions, the downstream\

    \ is then mapped into the ODU2 (or ODU3) via OPU2 (or\n      OPU3) and then mapped\

    \ into one ODTUG3.  The latter is\n      mapped into an ODU3 (via OPU3) and then\
    \ mapped into an OTU3.\n      Since an ODU2 multiplexed signal is requested (Signal\
    \ Type = 2,\n      and NMC = 4), the downstream node has to return four ODU labels\n\
    \      which can take for instance the following values:\n      - t3=18, t2=0,\
    \ t1=0 (first  part of ODU2 in first TS of ODTUG3)\n      - t3=22, t2=0, t1=0\

    \  part of ODU2 in sixth TS of ODTUG3)\n      - t3=26, t2=0, t1=0 (fourth part\
    \ of ODU2 in ninth TS of ODTUG3)\n   4. When a single OCh signal of 40 Gbps is\
    \ requested (Signal Type =\n      8), the downstream node must return a single\
    \ wavelength label as\n      specified in [RFC3471].\n   5. When requesting multiple\
    \ ODUk LSP (i.e., with a multiplier (MT)\n      value > 1), an explicit list of\
    \ labels is returned to the\n      requestor node.\n      When the downstream\
    \ node receives a request for a 4 x ODU1 signal\n      (Signal Type = 1, NMC =\
    \ 1 and MT = 4) multiplexed into an ODU3, it\n      returns an ordered list of\
    \ four labels to the upstream node: the\n      first ODU1 label corresponds to\
    \ the first signal of the LSP, the\n      second ODU1 label corresponds to the\
    \ second signal of the LSP,\n      etc.  For instance, the corresponding labels\

- title: Appendix B.  G.709 Indexes
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.  G.709 Indexes\n   - Index k: The index \"k\" is used to represent\
    \ a supported bit rate\n   and the different versions of OPUk, ODUk and OTUk.\
    \ k=1 represents an\n   approximate bit rate of 2.5 Gbit/s, k=2 represents an\
    \ approximate bit\n   rate of 10 Gbit/s, k = 3 an approximate bit rate of 40 Gbit/s\
    \ and k =\n   4 an approximate bit rate of 160 Gbit/s (under definition).  The\n\
    \   exact bit-rate values are in kbits/s:\n    . OPU: k=1: 2 488 320.000, k=2:\
    \  9 995 276.962, k=3: 40 150 519.322\n    . ODU: k=1: 2 498 775.126, k=2: 10\
    \ 037 273.924, k=3: 40 319 218.983\n    . OTU: k=1: 2 666 057.143, k=2: 10 709\
    \ 225.316, k=3: 43 018 413.559\n   - Index m: The index \"m\" is used to represent\
    \ the bit rate or set of\n   bit rates supported on the interface.  This is a\
    \ one or more digit\n   \"k\", where each \"k\" represents a particular bit rate.\
    \  The valid\n   values for m are (1, 2, 3, 12, 23, 123).\n   - Index n: The index\
    \ \"n\" is used to represent the order of the OTM,\n   OTS, OMS, OPS, OCG and\
    \ OMU.  This index represents the maximum number\n   of wavelengths that can be\
    \ supported at the lowest bit rate supported\n   on the wavelength.  It is possible\
    \ that a reduced number of higher\n   bit rate wavelengths are supported.  The\
    \ case n=0 represents a single\n   channel without a specific wavelength assigned\
    \ to the channel.\n   - Index r: The index \"r\", if present, is used to indicate\
    \ a reduced\n   functionality OTM, OCG, OCC and OCh (non-associated overhead is\
    \ not\n   supported).  Note that for n=0 the index r is not required as it\n \
    \  implies always reduced functionality.\n"
