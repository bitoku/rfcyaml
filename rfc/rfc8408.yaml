  - "Abstract\n   A Path Computation Element (PCE) can compute Traffic Engineering
    (TE)\n   paths through a network; these paths are subject to various\n   constraints.
    \ Currently, TE paths are Label Switched Paths (LSPs)\n   that are set up using
    the RSVP-TE signaling protocol.  However, other\n   TE path setup methods are
    possible within the PCE architecture.  This\n   document proposes an extension

  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC5440] describes the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    for\n   communication between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path\n   Computation
    Element (PCE) or between a PCE and a PCE.  A PCC\n   requests, from a PCE, a path
    subject to various constraints and\n   optimization criteria.  The PCE responds
    to the PCC with a hop-by-hop\n   path in an Explicit Route Object (ERO).  The
    PCC uses the ERO to set\n   up the path in the network.\n   [RFC8231] specifies
    extensions to PCEP that allow a PCC to delegate\n   its LSPs to a PCE.  The PCE
    can then update the state of LSPs\n   delegated to it.  In particular, the PCE
    may modify the path of an\n   LSP by sending a new ERO.  The PCC uses this ERO
    to reroute the LSP\n   in a make-before-break fashion.  [RFC8281] specifies a
    mechanism that\n   allows a PCE to dynamically instantiate an LSP on a PCC by
    sending\n   the ERO and the characteristics of the LSP.  The PCC creates the LSP\n
    \  using the ERO and other attributes sent by the PCE.\n   So far, PCEP and its
    extensions have assumed that the TE paths are\n   label switched and are established
    via the RSVP-TE signaling\n   protocol.  However, other methods of LSP setup are
    possible in the\n   PCE architecture (see [RFC4655] and [RFC4657]).  This document\n
    \  generalizes PCEP to allow other LSP setup methods to be used.  It\n   defines
    two new TLVs and specifies the base procedures to facilitate\n   this:\n   o  The
    PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV allows a PCEP speaker to\n      announce which
    LSP setup methods it supports when the PCEP session\n      is established.\n   o
    \ The PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV allows a PCEP speaker to specify which\n      setup
    method should be used for a given LSP.  When multiple path\n      setup types
    are deployed in a network, a given PCEP session may\n      have to simultaneously
    support more than one path setup type.  A\n      PCEP speaker uses the PATH-SETUP-TYPE
    TLV to explicitly indicate\n      the intended path setup type in the appropriate
    PCEP messages,\n      unless the path setup type is RSVP-TE (which is assumed
    to be the\n      path setup type if no other setup type is indicated).  This is
    so\n      that both the PCC and the PCE can take the necessary steps to set\n
    \     up the path.\n   This document defines a path setup type code for RSVP-TE.
    \ When a new\n   path setup type (other than RSVP-TE) is introduced for setting
    up a\n   path, a path setup type code and, optionally, a sub-TLV pertaining to\n
    \  the new path setup type will be defined by the document that\n   specifies
    the new path setup type.\n"

    \ Each PST has zero or one sub-TLVs associated with it, and\n      each sub-TLV
    is associated with exactly one PST.  Each sub-TLV\n      MUST obey the rules for
    TLV formatting defined in [RFC5440].  That\n      is, each sub-TLV is padded to
    a four-byte alignment, and the\n      Length field of each sub-TLV does not include
    the padding bytes.\n      This document does not define any sub-TLVs; an example
    sub-TLV can\n      be found in [PCEP-EXTENSIONS].\n   A PCEP speaker MUST check

    of the appended sub-TLVs,\n      excluding any padding bytes in the final sub-TLV.\n
    \  o  The Num of PSTs field MUST be greater than zero.\n   If a PCEP speaker receives
    a PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV that\n   violates these rules, then the PCEP
    speaker MUST send a PCErr message\n   with Error-Type = 10 (Reception of an invalid
    object) and Error-value\n   = 11 (Malformed object) and MUST close the PCEP session.

    PATH-\n   SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV, then it MUST ignore all but the first\n   instance
    of this TLV.\n   The absence of the PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV from the OPEN\n

    PST value of 0 (Path is set up using the RSVP-TE signaling\n   protocol) and no
    sub-TLVs.  A PCEP speaker MAY omit the PATH-SETUP-\n   TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV if
    the only PST it supports is RSVP-TE.  If a\n   PCEP speaker supports other PSTs
    besides RSVP-TE, then it SHOULD\n   include the PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV

    a\n   PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV from its peer, it MUST assume that the\n
    \  peer supports only the PSTs listed in the TLV.  If the PCEP speaker\n   and
    its peer have no PSTs in common, then the PCEP speaker MUST send\n   a PCErr message
    with Error-Type = 21 (Invalid traffic engineering\n   path setup type) and Error-value
    = 2 (Mismatched path setup type) and\n   close the PCEP session.\n   If the peer
    has sent no PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV, then the PCEP\n   speaker MUST infer
    that the peer supports path setup using at least\n   RSVP-TE.  The PCEP speaker
    MAY also infer that the peer supports\n   other path setup types, but the means
    of inference are outside the\n   scope of this document.\n   When a PCC sends
    a PCReq message to a PCE [RFC5440], it MUST include\n   the PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV
    in the RP object, unless the intended PST is\n   RSVP-TE (in which case it MAY
    omit the PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV).  If the\n   PCE is capable of expressing the path
    in a format appropriate to the\n   intended PST, it MUST use the appropriate ERO
    format in the PCRep\n   message.\n   When a PCE sends a PCRep message to a PCC
    [RFC5440], it MUST include\n   the PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV in the RP object, unless
    the PST is RSVP-TE\n   (in which case it MAY omit the PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV).  If
    the PCE does\n   not support the intended PST, it MUST send a PCErr message with\n
    \  Error-Type = 21 (Invalid traffic engineering path setup type) and\n   Error-value
    = 1 (Unsupported path setup type) and close the PCEP\n   session.  If the PSTs

    a PCErr message with Error-Type = 21\n   (Invalid traffic engineering path setup
    type) and Error-value = 2\n   (Mismatched path setup type) and close the PCEP
    session.\n   When a stateful PCE sends a PCUpd message [RFC8231] or a PCInitiate\n

    the SRP object, unless the intended PST is RSVP-TE (in which case\n   it MAY omit

    with the PCUpd or PCInitiate message, it MUST send\n   a PCErr message with Error-Type
    = 21 (Invalid traffic engineering\n   path setup type) and Error-value = 1 (Unsupported
    path setup type)\n   and close the PCEP session.\n   When a PCC sends a PCRpt
    message to a stateful PCE [RFC8231], it MUST\n   include the PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV
    in the SRP object, unless the PST is\n   RSVP-TE (in which case it MAY omit the
    PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV).  The PCC\n   MUST include the SRP object in the PCRpt message
    if the PST is not\n   RSVP-TE, even when the SRP-ID-number is the reserved value
    of\n   0x00000000.  If the PCRpt message is triggered by a PCUpd or\n   PCInitiate
    message, then the PST that the PCC indicates in the PCRpt\n   message MUST match
    the PST that the stateful PCE intended in the\n   PCUpd or PCInitiate message.
    \ If it does not match, then the PCE MUST\n   send a PCErr message with Error-Type
    = 21 (Invalid traffic\n   engineering path setup type) and Error-value = 2 (Mismatched
    path\n   setup type) and close the PCEP session.\n"

    setup types in PCEP.\n   o  What are the criteria for when devices will use the

    \ How can the network be migrated to the new path setup type, and\n      are there

    \  o  Are paths set up using the new path setup type intended to coexist\n      with
    other paths over the long term, and if so, how is this\n      situation managed
    with PCEP?\n   o  How can operators verify the correct operation of PCEP in the\n
    \     network with respect to the new path setup type?  Which fault\n      conditions
    must be reported to the operators?\n   o  Are there any existing management interfaces
