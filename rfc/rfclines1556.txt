Abstract This document describes the format and syntax of the "direction" keyword to be used with bi directional texts in MIME.
The MIME standards (RFC 1521 and 1522) defined methods for transporting non ASCII data via a standard RFC822 e mail system.
Specifically, the Content type field allows for the inclusion of any ISO language such as Arabic (ISO 8859 6) or Hebrew (ISO 8859 8).
The problem is that the these two languages are read from right to left and can have bi directional data such as mixed Hebrew and English on the same line.
Fortunately, ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) has tackled this problem previously and has issued a technical report called "Handling of Bi Directional Texts".
ECMA TR/53, as it is called, was used to update the Standard ECMA 48 which in turn was used as the basis for ISO/IEC 6429 which was adopted under a special "fast track procedure".
It is based on this information that a new character set is being defined which will indicate that the bi  directional message is either encoded in implicit mode or explicit mode.
The default is visual mode which requires no special character set other than the standard ones previously defined by ISO 8859.
Examples of new character sets for bi directionality support: Content type: text/plain; charset ISO 8859 6 e Content type: text/plain; charset ISO 8859 6
; charset ISO 8859 8 e Content type:
; charset ISO 8859 8
The "i" suffix refers to implicit mode and the "e" suffix
Implicit Implicit directionality is a presentation method in which the direction is determined by an algorithm according to the type of characters and their position relative to the adjacent characters and according to their primary direction.
The complete algorithm is quite complex and sites wishing to implement it should refer to the ECMA Technical Report for further details.
Explicit Explicit directionality is a presentation method in which the direction is explicitly defined by using control sequences which are interleaved within the text and are used for direction determination.
This presentation method is also defined in ECMA TR/53, which defines three new control functions and updates 22 existing control functions in the ECMA 48 standard.
Visual Visual directionality is a presentation method that displays text according to the primary display direction only, which is left to right.
All text is viewed in the same direction which is the primary display direction.
The displaying application is not aware of the contents direction and displays the text as if it were a uni  directional text.
The composing application needs to prepare the text in such a way that it will be displayed correctly.
No control characters or algorithms are used to determine how the data is to be displayed.
This is the simplest of all methods and the default method for use with MIME encoded texts.
Security Considerations Security issues are not discussed in this memo.
