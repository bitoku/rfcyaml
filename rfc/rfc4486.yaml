  - "4.  Subcode Usage\n   If a BGP speaker decides to terminate its peering with
    a neighbor\n   because the number of address prefixes received from the neighbor\n
    \  exceeds a locally configured upper bound (as described in [BGP-4]),\n   then
    the speaker MUST send to the neighbor a NOTIFICATION message\n   with the Error
    Code Cease and the Error Subcode \"Maximum Number of\n   Prefixes Reached\".  The
    message MAY optionally include the Address\n   Family information [BGP-MP] and
    the upper bound in the \"Data\" field,\n   as shown in Figure 1, where the meaning
    and use of the <AFI, SAFI>\n   tuple is the same as defined in [BGP-MP], Section
    7.\n                  +-------------------------------+\n                  | AFI
    (2 octets)                |\n                  +-------------------------------+\n
    \                 | SAFI (1 octet)                |\n                  +-------------------------------+\n
    \                 | Prefix upper bound (4 octets) |\n                  +-------------------------------+\n
    \                    Figure 1: Optional Data Field\n   If a BGP speaker decides
    to administratively shut down its peering\n   with a neighbor, then the speaker
    SHOULD send a NOTIFICATION message\n   with the Error Code Cease and the Error
    Subcode \"Administrative\n   Shutdown\".\n   If a BGP speaker decides to de-configure
    a peer, then the speaker\n   SHOULD send a NOTIFICATION message with the Error
    Code Cease and the\n   Error Subcode \"Peer De-configured\".\n   If a BGP speaker
    decides to administratively reset the peering with a\n   neighbor, then the speaker
    SHOULD send a NOTIFICATION message with\n   the Error Code Cease and the Error
    Subcode \"Administrative Reset\".\n   If a BGP speaker decides to disallow a BGP
    connection (e.g., the peer\n   is not configured locally) after the speaker accepts
    a transport\n   protocol connection, then the BGP speaker SHOULD send a NOTIFICATION\n
    \  message with the Error Code Cease and the Error Subcode \"Connection\n   Rejected\".\n
    \  If a BGP speaker decides to administratively reset the peering with a\n   neighbor
    due to a configuration change other than the ones described\n   above, then the
    speaker SHOULD send a NOTIFICATION message with the\n   Error Code Cease and the
    Error Subcode \"Other Configuration Change\".\n   If a BGP speaker decides to
    send a NOTIFICATION message with the\n   Error Code Cease as a result of the collision
    resolution procedure\n   (as described in [BGP-4]), then the subcode SHOULD be
    set to\n   \"Connection Collision Resolution\".\n   If a BGP speaker runs out
    of resources (e.g., memory) and decides to\n   reset a session, then the speaker
    MAY send a NOTIFICATION message\n   with the Error Code Cease and the Error Subcode
    \"Out of Resources\".\n   It is RECOMMENDED that a BGP speaker behave as though
    the\n   DampPeerOscillations attribute [BGP-4] were true for this peer when\n
    \  re-trying a BGP connection after the speaker receives a Cease\n   NOTIFICATION
    message with a subcode of \"Administrative Shutdown\",\n   \"Peer De-configured\",
    \"Connection Rejected\", or \"Out of Resources\".\n   An implementation SHOULD
    impose an upper bound on the number of\n   consecutive automatic retries.  Once
    this bound is reached, the\n   implementation would stop re-trying any BGP connections
    until some\n   administrative intervention, i.e., set the AllowAutomaticStart\n
    \  attribute [BGP-4] to FALSE.\n"

    BGP Cease\n   NOTIFICATION message.  Future assignments are to be made using either\n
    \  the Standards Action process defined in [RFC-2434], or the Early IANA\n   Allocation
    process defined in [RFC-4020].  Assignments consist of a\n   name and the value.\n"
