- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document discusses how RFC 1858 compliant filters can be\n\
    \   vulnerable to a variant of the \"Tiny Fragment Attack\" described in\n   section\
    \ 3.1 of the RFC.  This document describes the attack and\n   recommends corrective\
    \ action.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   RFC 1858 provides an excellent description of a class of\
    \ attack on\n   Internet firewalls and proposes countermeasures.  However one\
    \ of\n   these countmeasures, the \"Indirect Method\" (section 3.2.2) is\n   vulnerable\
    \ to a combination of two of the attacks described.\n   The attack combines the\
    \ features of the \"Tiny Fragment Attack\"\n   (section 3) and the \"Overlapping\
    \ Fragment Attack\" (section 4).\n"
- title: 1.1 The scope of the attack
  contents:
  - "1.1 The scope of the attack\n   Where the filtering rules allow incoming connections\
    \ to a machine AND\n   there other ports which allow only outgoing connections\
    \ on the same\n   host, the attack allows incoming connections to the supposedly\n\
    \   outgoing-only ports.\n   Note that only the initial connection message need\
    \ be fragmented.\n   Once the connection is established further traffic on it\
    \ is legal.\n   The significance of this weakness will depend on the security\
    \ policy\n   in force.\n"
- title: 2. The Tiny Overlapping Fragment Attack
  contents:
  - "2. The Tiny Overlapping Fragment Attack\n   The attack typically consists of\
    \ sending three fragments.\n   Fragment 1: (Fragment offset = 0; length >= 16)\n\
    \      Includes whole header and is entirely legal.  Typically it\n      describes\
    \ a SYN packet initiating a new TCP connection to a port\n      on the target\
    \ host that is allowed to receive incoming\n      connections.\n      e.g., Incoming\
    \ connection to port 25 SMTP.\n   Fragment 2: (Fragment offset = 0; length = 8)\n\
    \      Is only the first 8 bytes and could be legal depending on the\n      other\
    \ 8-bytes of the header, but is NOT legal combined with the\n      corresponding\
    \ bytes from Fragment 1.  Such a fragment includes\n      only the port numbers\
    \ and sequence number from the TCP header.\n      Typically this packet replaces\
    \ the destination port number with a\n      port number on which the destination\
    \ host that is not allowed to\n      receive incoming connections.\n   Fragment\
    \ 3:  (Fragment offset >= 2; length = rest of message)\n      Contains no header\
    \ and completes the message.  (This third\n      fragment is not part of the attack.\
    \  However Fragment 1 cannot be\n      the complete message or it would be passed\
    \ up to the application\n      before Fragment 2 arrived so a third fragment is\
    \ necessary.)\n"
- title: 2.1 Example of the attack
  contents:
  - "2.1 Example of the attack\n   Consider the following trivial set of rules for\
    \ incoming packets:\n   +---+-------+-------+-------+-------+-----------------------+\n\
    \   | No|Action | Source| Dest. | Flags | Purpose               |\n   |   |  \
    \     | Port  | Port  |       |                       |\n   +===+=======+=======+=======+=======+=======================+\n\
    \   | 1 |Permit | >1023 | SMTP  |  ANY  | Incoming E-mail       |\n   +---+-------+-------+-------+-------+-----------------------+\n\
    \   | 2 |Permit | >1023 |  ANY  |  Ack=1| Existing FTP data     |\n   |   |  \
    \             |       |       | channel connections.  |\n   +---+-------+-------+-------+-------+-----------------------+\n\
    \   | 3 |Deny   | ANY   |  ANY  |  ANY  | Default deny          |\n   +---+-------+-------+-------+-------+-----------------------+\n\
    \   Fragment 1: attacker(1234) -> target(SMTP) Ack=0\n      This is a new SMTP\
    \ connection and is permitted by rule 1.\n   Fragment 2: attacker(1234) -> target(Telnet=23)\
    \ Ack=absent\n      All fields present conform to rule 2, as it could be the start\
    \ of\n      an FTP packet.\n   Depending on the precise implementation of the\
    \ fragment reassembly in\n   the target machine's IP stack, fragment B may overwrite\
    \ fragment A to\n   produce:-\n      attacker(1234) -> target(Telnet) Ack=0\n\
    \          (new telnet connection)\n"
- title: 2.2 The failure of "Indirect Method"
  contents:
  - "2.2 The failure of \"Indirect Method\"\n   The Indirect Method attempts to solve\
    \ both Tiny Fragment and\n   Overlapping Fragment attacks, solely by rejecting\
    \ packets with FO=1.\n   However none of the above fragments have FO=1, so none\
    \ are rejected.\n   The failure is clear on careful reading.  In section 3.2.2\
    \ \"Indirect\n   Method\", RFC 1858 states:-\n      The indirect method relies\
    \ on the observation that when a TCP\n      packet is fragmented so as to force\
    \ \"interesting\" header fields\n      out of the zero-offset fragment, there\
    \ must exist a fragment with\n      FO equal to 1.\n   This is normally true where\
    \ the fragments are genuine fragments,\n   generally by bona fide software, but\
    \ it is simply not true that a\n   hacker forging fragments is forced to produce\
    \ an FO=1 fragment simply\n   because (s)he has produced an 8-byte FO=0 fragment.\
    \  The\n   vulnerability flows from this false premise.\n"
- title: 3. Countermeasures
  contents:
  - "3. Countermeasures\n   Whereas apparently very elegant, RFC 1858's Indirect Method\
    \ is not\n   robust.  In addition to blocking FO=1 packets, it is also necessary\n\
    \   to block FO=0 that hold less than a complete header.\n      if FO=0 and PROTOCOL=TCP\
    \ and TRANSPORTLEN < tmin then\n              DROP PACKET\n      if FO=1 and PROTOCOL=TCP\
    \ then\n              DROP PACKET\n"
