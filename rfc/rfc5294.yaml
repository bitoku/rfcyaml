  - "1.  Introduction\n   There has been some analysis of the security threats to\
    \ the multicast\n   routing infrastructures [RFC4609], some work on implementing\n\
    \   confidentiality, integrity, and authorization in the multicast\n   payload\
    \ [RFC3740], and also some analysis of security threats in\n   Internet Group\
    \ Management Protocol/Multicast Listener Discovery\n   (IGMP/MLD) [DALEY-MAGMA],\
    \ but no comprehensive analysis of security\n   threats to PIM at the host-connecting\
    \ (typically \"Local Area\n   Network\") links.\n   We define these PIM host threats\
    \ to include:\n   o  Nodes using PIM to attack or deny service to hosts on the\
    \ same\n      link,\n   o  Nodes using PIM to attack or deny service to valid\
    \ multicast\n      routers on the link, or\n   o  Nodes using PIM (Register messages)\
    \ to bypass the controls of\n      multicast routers on the link.\n   The attacking\
    \ node is typically a host or a host acting as an\n   illegitimate router.\n \
    \  A node originating multicast data can disturb existing receivers of\n   the\
    \ group on the same link, but this issue is not PIM-specific so it\n   is out\
    \ of scope.  Subverting legitimate routers is out of scope.\n   Security implications\
    \ on multicast routing infrastructure are\n   described in [RFC4609].\n   This\
    \ document analyzes the PIM host-interface vulnerabilities,\n   formulates a few\
    \ specific threats, proposes some potential ways to\n   mitigate these problems,\
    \ and analyzes how well those methods\n   accomplish fixing the issues.\n   It\
    \ is assumed that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts of\n   PIM.\n\
    \   Analysis of PIM-DM [RFC3973] is out of scope of this document.\n"

  - "2.  Host-Interface PIM Vulnerabilities\n   This section briefly describes the\
    \ main attacks against host-\n   interface PIM signaling, before we get to the\
    \ actual threats and\n   mitigation methods in the next sections.\n   The attacking\
    \ node may be either a malicious host or an illegitimate\n   router.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Nodes May Send Illegitimate PIM Register Messages
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Nodes May Send Illegitimate PIM Register Messages\n   PIM Register messages\
    \ are sent unicast, and contain encapsulated\n   multicast data packets.  Malicious\
    \ hosts or routers could also send\n   Register messages themselves, for example,\
    \ to get around rate-limits\n   or to interfere with foreign Rendezvous Points\
    \ (RPs), as described in\n   [RFC4609].\n   The Register message can be targeted\
    \ to any IP address, whether in or\n   out of the local PIM domain.  The source\
    \ address may be spoofed,\n   unless spoofing has been prevented [RFC3704], to\
    \ create arbitrary\n   state at the RPs.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Nodes May Become Illegitimate PIM Neighbors
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Nodes May Become Illegitimate PIM Neighbors\n   When PIM has been enabled\
    \ on a router's host interface, any node can\n   also become a PIM neighbor using\
    \ PIM Hello messages.  Having become a\n   PIM neighbor in this way, the node\
    \ is able to send other PIM messages\n   to the router and may use those messages\
    \ to attack the router.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Routers May Accept PIM Messages from Non-Neighbors
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Routers May Accept PIM Messages from Non-Neighbors\n   The PIM-SM (Sparse\
    \ Mode) specification recommends that PIM messages\n   other than Hellos should\
    \ not be accepted, except from valid PIM\n   neighbors.  The Bidirectional-PIM\
    \ (BIDIR-PIM) specification specifies\n   that packets from non-neighbors \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\" be accepted; see Section\n   5.2 of [RFC5015].  However, the specification\
    \ does not mandate this,\n   so some implementations may be susceptible to attack\
    \ from PIM\n   messages sent by non-neighbors.\n"

- title: 2.4.1.  PIM-SM Designated Router Election
  contents:
  - "2.4.1.  PIM-SM Designated Router Election\n   In PIM-SM, the Designated Router\
    \ (DR) on a Local Area Network (LAN)\n   is responsible for Register-encapsulating\
    \ data from new sources on\n   the LAN, and for generating PIM Join/Prune messages\
    \ on behalf of\n   group members on the LAN.\n   A node that can become a PIM\
    \ neighbor can also cause itself to be\n   elected DR, whether or not the DR Priority\
    \ option is being used in\n   PIM Hello messages on the LAN.\n"
- title: 2.4.2.  BIDIR-PIM Designated Forwarder Election
  contents:
  - "2.4.2.  BIDIR-PIM Designated Forwarder Election\n   In BIDIR-PIM [RFC5015], a\
    \ Designated Forwarder (DF) is elected per\n   link.  The DF is responsible for\
    \ forwarding data downstream onto the\n   link, and also for forwarding data from\
    \ its link upstream.\n   A node that can become a BIDIR-PIM neighbor (this is\
    \ just like\n   becoming a PIM neighbor, except that the PIM Hello messages must\n\
    \   include the Bidirectional Capable PIM-Hello option) can cause itself\n   to\
    \ be elected DF by sending DF Offer messages with a better metric\n   than its\
    \ neighbors.\n   There are also some other BIDIR-PIM attacks related to DF election,\n\
    \   including spoofing DF Offer and DF Winner messages (e.g., using a\n   legitimate\
    \ router's IP address), making all but the impersonated\n   router believe that\
    \ router is the DF.  Also, an attacker might\n   prevent the DF election from\
    \ converging by sending an infinite\n   sequence of DF Offer messages.\n   For\
    \ further discussion of BIDIR-PIM threats, we refer to the Security\n   Considerations\
    \ section in [RFC5015].\n"
- title: 2.5.  A Node May Become an Illegitimate PIM Asserted Forwarder
  contents:
  - "2.5.  A Node May Become an Illegitimate PIM Asserted Forwarder\n   With a PIM\
    \ Assert message, a router can be elected to be in charge of\n   forwarding all\
    \ traffic for a particular (S,G) or (*,G) onto the LAN.\n   This overrides DR\
    \ behavior.\n   The specification says that Assert messages should only be accepted\n\
    \   from known PIM neighbors, and \"SHOULD\" be discarded otherwise.  So,\n  \
    \ either the node must be able to spoof an IP address of a current\n   neighbor,\
    \ form a PIM adjacency first, or count on these checks being\n   disabled.\n \
    \  The Assert Timer, by default, is 3 minutes; the state must be\n   refreshed\
    \ or it will be removed automatically.\n   As noted before, it is also possible\
    \ to spoof an Assert (e.g., using\n   a legitimate router's IP address) to cause\
    \ a temporary disruption on\n   the LAN.\n"
- title: 2.6.  BIDIR-PIM Does Not Use RPF Check
  contents:
  - "2.6.  BIDIR-PIM Does Not Use RPF Check\n   PIM protocols do not perform Reverse\
    \ Path Forwarding (RPF) check on\n   the shared tree (e.g., in PIM-SM from the\
    \ RP to local receivers).  On\n   the other hand, RPF check is performed, e.g.,\
    \ on stub host\n   interfaces.  Because all forwarding in BIDIR-PIM is based on\
    \ the\n   shared tree principle, it does not use RPF check to verify that the\n\
    \   forwarded packets are being received from a \"topologically correct\"\n  \
    \ direction.  This has two immediately obvious implications:\n   1.  A node may\
    \ maintain a forwarding loop until the Time to Live\n       (TTL) runs out by\
    \ passing packets from interface A to B. This is\n       not believed to cause\
    \ significant new risk as with a similar ease\n       such a node could generate\
    \ original packets that would loop back\n       to its other interface.\n   2.\
    \  A node may spoof source IP addresses in multicast packets it\n       sends.\
    \  Other PIM protocols drop such packets when performing the\n       RPF check.\
    \  BIDIR-PIM accepts such packets, allowing easier\n       Denial-of-Service (DoS)\
    \ attacks on the multicast delivery tree\n       and making the attacker less\
    \ traceable.\n"

    \   vulnerabilities.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Denial-of-Service Attack on the Link
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Denial-of-Service Attack on the Link\n   The easiest attack is to deny\
    \ the multicast service on the link.\n   This could mean either not forwarding\
    \ all (or parts of) multicast\n   traffic from upstream onto the link, or not\
    \ registering or forwarding\n   upstream the multicast transmissions originated\
    \ on the link.\n   These attacks can be done in multiple ways: the most typical\
    \ one\n   would be becoming the DR through becoming a neighbor with Hello\n  \
    \ messages and winning the DR election.  After that, one could, for\n   example:\n\
    \   o  Not send any PIM Join/Prune messages based on the IGMP reports, or\n  \
    \ o  Not forward or register any sourced packets.\n   Sending PIM Prune messages\
    \ may also be an effective attack vector\n   even if the attacking node is not\
    \ elected DR, since PIM Prune\n   messages are accepted from downstream interfaces\
    \ even if the router\n   is not a DR.\n   An alternative mechanism is to send\
    \ a PIM Assert message, spoofed to\n   come from a valid PIM neighbor or non-spoofed\
    \ if a PIM adjacency has\n   already been formed.  For the particular (S,G) or\
    \ (*,G) from the\n   Assert message, this creates the same result as getting elected\
    \ as a\n   DR.  With BIDIR-PIM, similar attacks can be done by becoming the DF\n\
    \   or by preventing the DF election from converging.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Denial-of-Service Attack on the Outside
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Denial-of-Service Attack on the Outside\n   It is also possible to perform\
    \ Denial-of-Service attacks on nodes\n   beyond the link, especially in environments\
    \ where a multicast router\n   and/or a DR is considered to be a trusted node.\n\
    \   In particular, if DRs perform some form of rate-limiting, for\n   example,\
    \ on new Join/Prune messages, becoming a DR and sending those\n   messages yourself\
    \ allows one to subvert these restrictions;\n   therefore, rate-limiting functions\
    \ need to be deployed at multiple\n   layers, as described in [RFC4609].\n   In\
    \ addition, any host can send PIM Register messages on their own, to\n   whichever\
    \ RP it wants; further, if unicast RPF (Reverse Path\n   Forwarding) mechanisms\
    \ [RFC3704] have not been applied, the packet\n   may be spoofed.  This can be\
    \ done to get around rate-limits, and/or\n   to attack remote RPs, and/or to interfere\
    \ with the integrity of an\n   ASM group.  This attack is also described in [RFC4609].\n\
    \   Also, BIDIR-PIM does not prevent nodes from using topologically\n   incorrect\
    \ addresses (source address spoofing) making such an attack\n   more difficult\
    \ to trace.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Confidentiality, Integrity, or Authorization Violations
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Confidentiality, Integrity, or Authorization Violations\n   Contrary to\
    \ unicast, any node is able to legitimately receive all\n   multicast transmission\
    \ on the link by just adjusting the appropriate\n   link-layer multicast filters.\
    \  Confidentiality (if needed) must be\n   obtained by cryptography.\n   If a\
    \ node can become a DR, it is able to violate the integrity of any\n   data streams\
    \ sent by sources on the LAN, by modifying (possibly in\n   subtle, unnoticeable\
    \ ways) the packets sent by the sources before\n   Register-encapsulating them.\n\
    \   If a node can form a PIM neighbor adjacency or spoof the IP address\n   of\
    \ a current neighbor, then if it has external connectivity by some\n   other means\
    \ other than the LAN, the node is able to violate the\n   integrity of any data\
    \ streams sent by external sources onto the LAN.\n   It would do this by sending\
    \ an appropriate Assert message onto the\n   LAN to prevent the genuine PIM routers\
    \ forwarding the valid data,\n   obtaining the multicast traffic via its other\
    \ connection, and\n   modifying those data packets before forwarding them onto\
    \ the LAN.\n   In either of the above two cases, the node could operate as normal\n\
    \   for some traffic, while violating integrity for some other traffic.\n   A\
    \ more elaborate attack is on authorization.  There are some very\n   questionable\
    \ models [HAYASHI] where the current multicast\n   architecture is used to provide\
    \ paid multicast service, and where the\n   authorization/authentication is added\
    \ to the group management\n   protocols such as IGMP.  Needless to say, if a host\
    \ would be able to\n   act as a router, it might be possible to perform all kinds\
    \ of\n   attacks: subscribe to multicast service without using IGMP (i.e.,\n \
    \  without having to pay for it), deny the service for the others on the\n   same\
    \ link, etc.  In short, to be able to ensure authorization, a\n   better architecture\
    \ should be used instead (e.g., [RFC3740]).\n"

- title: 4.1.  Passive Mode for PIM
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Passive Mode for PIM\n   The current PIM specification seems to mandate\
    \ running the PIM Hello\n   protocol on all PIM-enabled interfaces.  Most implementations\
    \ require\n   PIM to be enabled on an interface in order to send PIM Register\n\
    \   messages for data sent by sources on that interface or to do any\n   other\
    \ PIM processing.\n   As described in [RFC4609], running full PIM, with Hello\
    \ messages and\n   all, is unnecessary for those stub networks for which only\
    \ one router\n   is providing multicast service.  Therefore, such implementations\n\
    \   should provide an option to specify that the interface is \"passive\"\n  \
    \ with regard to PIM: no PIM packets are sent or processed (if\n   received),\
    \ but hosts can still send and receive multicast on that\n   interface.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Use of IPsec among PIM Routers
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Use of IPsec among PIM Routers\n   Instead of passive mode, or when multiple\
    \ PIM routers exist on a\n   single link, one could also use IPsec to secure the\
    \ PIM messaging, to\n   prevent anyone from subverting it.  The actual procedures\
    \ have been\n   described in [RFC4601] and [LINKLOCAL].\n   However, it is worth\
    \ noting that setting up IPsec Security\n   Associations (SAs) manually can be\
    \ a very tedious process, and the\n   routers might not even support IPsec; further\
    \ automatic key\n   negotiation may not be feasible in these scenarios either.\
    \  A Group\n   Domain of Interpretation (GDOI) [RFC3547] server might be able\
    \ to\n   mitigate this negotiation.\n"
- title: 4.3.  IP Filtering PIM Messages
  contents:
  - "4.3.  IP Filtering PIM Messages\n   To eliminate both the unicast and multicast\
    \ PIM messages, in similar\n   scenarios to those for which PIM passive mode is\
    \ applicable, it might\n   be possible to block IP protocol 103 (all PIM messages)\
    \ in an input\n   access list.  This is more effective than PIM passive mode,\
    \ as this\n   also blocks Register messages.\n   This is also acceptable when\
    \ there is more than one PIM router on the\n   link if IPsec is used (because\
    \ the access-list processing sees the\n   valid PIM messages as IPsec AH/ESP packets).\
    \  In this case, unicast\n   Register messages must also be protected with IPsec\
    \ or the routing\n   topology must be such that the link is never used to originate,\
    \ or\n   transit unicast Register messages.\n   When multiple routers exist on\
    \ a link, IPsec is not required if it is\n   possible to prevent hosts from sending\
    \ PIM messages at the Ethernet\n   switch (or equivalent) host ports.  This could\
    \ be accomplished in at\n   least two ways:\n   1.  Use IP access lists on the\
    \ stub routers to allow PIM messages\n       from the valid neighbor IP addresses\
    \ only, and implement IP\n       spoofing prevention at the Ethernet-switch-port\
    \ level using\n       proprietary mechanisms, or\n   2.  Filter out all PIM messages\
    \ at configured host ports on Ethernet\n       switches instead of doing it on\
    \ the routers.\n   The main benefit of this approach is that multiple stub routers\
    \ can\n   still communicate through the LAN without IPsec but hosts are not\n\
    \   able to disturb the PIM protocol.  The drawback is that Ethernet\n   switches\
    \ need to implement much finer-grained IP layer filtering, and\n   the operational\
    \ requirements of carefully maintaining these filters\n   could be significant.\n"

    \ if BIDIR-PIM is used,\n   ingress filtering will need to be applied in stub\
    \ interfaces to\n   multicast packets, as well as unicast, to prevent hosts using\
