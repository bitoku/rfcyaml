- title: 1.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "1.  Problem Statement\n   [ISO10589] defines the format of a Link State PDU (LSP)\
    \ that includes\n   a Remaining Lifetime field.  This field is set by the originator\n\
    \   based on local configuration and then decremented by all systems once\n  \
    \ the entry is stored in their LSP Database (LSPDB) consistent with the\n   passing\
    \ of time.  This allows all Intermediate Systems (ISs) to age\n   out the LSP\
    \ at approximately the same time.\n   Each LSP also has a checksum field to allow\
    \ receiving systems to\n   detect errors that may have occurred during transmission.\
    \  [ISO10589]\n   mandates that the checksum is calculated by the originator of\
    \ the LSP\n   and cannot be modified by other routers.  Therefore, the Remaining\n\
    \   Lifetime is deliberately excluded from the checksum calculation.  In\n   cases\
    \ where cryptographic authentication is included in an LSP\n   ([RFC5304] or [RFC5310]),\
    \ the Remaining Lifetime field is also\n   excluded from the hash calculation.\
    \  If the Remaining Lifetime field\n   gets corrupted during flooding, this corruption\
    \ is therefore\n   undetectable.  The consequences of such corruption depend upon\
    \ how\n   the Remaining Lifetime is altered.\n   In cases where the Remaining\
    \ Lifetime becomes larger than the\n   originator intended, the impact is benign.\
    \  As the originator is\n   responsible for refreshing the LSP before it ages\
    \ out, a new version\n   of the LSP will be generated before the LSP ages out,\
    \ so no harm is\n   done.\n   In cases where the Remaining Lifetime field becomes\
    \ smaller than the\n   originator intended, the LSP may age out prematurely (i.e.,\
    \ before\n   the originator refreshes the LSP).  This has two negative\n   consequences:\n\
    \   1.  The LSP will be purged by an IS when the Remaining Lifetime\n       expires.\
    \  This will cause a temporary loss of reachability to\n       destinations impacted\
    \ by the content of that LSP.\n   2.  Unnecessary LSP flooding will occur as a\
    \ result of the premature\n       purge and subsequent regeneration/flooding of\
    \ a new version of\n       the LSP by the originator.\n   If the corrupted Remaining\
    \ Lifetime is only modestly shorter than the\n   lifetime assigned by the originator,\
    \ the negative impacts are also\n   modest.  If, however, the corrupted Remaining\
    \ Lifetime becomes very\n   small, then the negative impacts can become significant,\
    \ especially\n   in cases where the cause of the corruption is persistent so that\
    \ the\n   cycle repeats itself frequently.\n   A backwards-compatible solution\
    \ to this problem is defined in the\n   following sections.\n"

    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Solution
  contents:
  - "2.  Solution\n   As discussed in the previous section, the problematic case is\
    \ when\n   the Remaining Lifetime is corrupted and becomes much smaller than it\n\
    \   should be.  The goal of the solution is then to prevent premature\n   purging.\n\
    \   Under normal circumstances, updates to an LSP -- including purging,\n   if\
    \ appropriate -- are the responsibility of the originator of the\n   LSP.  There\
    \ is a maximum time between generations of a given LSP.\n   Once this time has\
    \ expired, it is the responsibility of the\n   originator to refresh the LSP (i.e.,\
    \ issue a new version with a\n   higher sequence number) even if the contents\
    \ of the LSP have not\n   changed.  [ISO10589] defines maximumLSPGenerationInterval\
    \ to be\n   sufficiently less than the maximum lifetime of an LSP so that the\
    \ new\n   version can be flooded network wide before the old version ages out\n\
    \   on any IS.\n   [ISO10589] defines two cases where a system other than the\
    \ originator\n   of an LSP is allowed to purge an LSP:\n   1.  The LSP ages out.\
    \  This should only occur if the originating IS\n       is no longer reachable\
    \ and therefore is unable to update the LSP.\n   2.  There is a Designated Intermediate\
    \ System (DIS) change on a LAN.\n       The pseudonode LSPs generated by the previous\
    \ DIS are no longer\n       required and may be purged by the new DIS.\n   In\
    \ both of these cases, purging is not necessary for correct\n   operation of the\
    \ protocol.  It is provided as an optimization to\n   remove stale entries from\
    \ the LSPDB.\n   In cases where the Remaining Lifetime in a received LSP has been\n\
    \   corrupted and is smaller than the Remaining Lifetime at the\n   originating\
    \ node, when the Remaining Lifetime expires on the\n   receiving node, it can\
    \ appear as if the originating IS has failed to\n   regenerate the LSP before\
    \ it ages out (case #1 above).  To prevent\n   this from having a negative impact,\
    \ a modest change to the storage of\n   \"new\" LSPs in the LSPDB is specified.\n\
    \   Section 7.3.16 of [ISO10589] defines the rules to determine whether a\n  \
    \ received LSP is older, the same, or newer than the copy of the same\n   LSP\
    \ in the receiver's LSPDB.  The key elements are:\n   o  Higher sequence numbers\
    \ are newer.\n   o  If sequence numbers are the same, an LSP with a zero Remaining\n\
    \      Lifetime (a purged LSP) is newer than the same LSP with a non-zero\n  \
    \    Remaining Lifetime.\n   o  If both the received and local copy of the LSP\
    \ have a non-zero\n      Remaining Lifetime, they are considered the same even\
    \ if the\n      Remaining Lifetimes differ.\n   Section 7.3.15.1.e(1) of [ISO10589]\
    \ defines the actions to take on\n   receipt of an LSP generated by another IS\
    \ that is newer than the\n   local copy and has a non-zero Remaining Lifetime.\
    \  An additional\n   action is defined by this document:\n   vi.  If the Remaining\
    \ Lifetime of the new LSP is less than MaxAge, it\n        is set to MaxAge.\n\
    \   This additional action ensures that no matter what value of Remaining\n  \
    \ Lifetime is received, a system other than the originator of an LSP\n   will\
    \ never purge the LSP until the LSP has existed in the database\n   for at least\
    \ MaxAge.\n   It is important to note that no change is proposed for handling\
    \ the\n   receipt of purged LSPs.  The rules specified in Section 7.3.15.1.b of\n\
    \   [ISO10589] still apply, i.e., an LSP received with a zero Remaining\n   Lifetime\
    \ is still considered newer than a matching LSP with a non-\n   zero Remaining\
    \ Lifetime.  Therefore, the changes proposed here will\n   not result in LSPDB\
    \ inconsistency among routers in the network.\n"

  - "3.  Deployment Considerations\n   This section discusses some possible deployment\
    \ issues for this\n   protocol extension.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Inconsistent Values for MaxAge
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Inconsistent Values for MaxAge\n   [ISO10589] defines MaxAge (the maximum\
    \ value for the Remaining\n   Lifetime in an LSP) as an architectural constant\
    \ of 20 minutes (1200\n   seconds).  However, in practice, implementations have\
    \ supported\n   allowing this value to be configurable.  The common intent of\
    \ a\n   configurable value is to support longer lifetimes than the default,\n\
    \   thus reducing the periodic regeneration of LSPs in the absence of\n   topology\
    \ changes.  See a discussion of this point in [RFC3719].  It\n   is therefore\
    \ possible for the value of MaxAge on the IS that\n   originates an LSP to be\
    \ higher or lower than the value of MaxAge on\n   the ISs that receive the LSP.\n\
    \   If the value of MaxAge of the IS that originated the LSP is smaller\n   than\
    \ the value of MaxAge of the receiver of an LSP, then setting the\n   Remaining\
    \ Lifetime of the received LSP to the local value of MaxAge\n   will ensure that\
    \ it is not purged prematurely.  However, if the value\n   of MaxAge on the receiver\
    \ is less than that of the originator, then\n   it is still possible to have an\
    \ LSP purged prematurely when using the\n   extension defined in the previous\
    \ section.  Implementors of this\n   extension may wish to protect against this\
    \ case by making the value\n   to which the Remaining Lifetime is set under the\
    \ conditions described\n   in the previous section configurable.  If that is done,\
    \ the\n   configured value MUST be greater than or equal to the locally\n   configured\
    \ value of MaxAge.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Reporting Corrupted Lifetime
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Reporting Corrupted Lifetime\n   Reporting reception of an LSP with a possible\
    \ corrupt Remaining\n   Lifetime field can be useful in identifying a problem\
    \ in the network.\n   In order to minimize the reports of false positives, the\
    \ following\n   algorithm SHOULD be used in determining whether the Remaining\n\
    \   Lifetime in the received LSP is possibly corrupt:\n   o  The LSP has passed\
    \ all acceptance tests as specified in\n      Section 7.3.15.1 of [ISO10589].\n\
    \   o  The LSP is newer than the copy in the local LSPDB (including the\n    \
    \  case of not being present in the LSPDB).\n   o  The Remaining Lifetime in the\
    \ received LSP is less than\n      ZeroAgeLifetime.\n   o  The adjacency to the\
    \ neighbor from which the LSP is received has\n      been up for a minimum of\
    \ ZeroAgeLifetime.\n   In such a case, an IS SHOULD generate a CorruptRemainingLifetime\n\
    \   event.\n   Note that it is not possible to guarantee that all cases of a corrupt\n\
    \   Remaining Lifetime will be detected using the above algorithm.  It is\n  \
    \ also not possible to guarantee that all CorruptRemainingLifetime\n   events\
    \ reported using the above algorithm are valid.  As a diagnostic\n   aid, an implementation\
    \ MAY wish to retain the value of the Remaining\n   Lifetime received when the\
    \ LSP was added to the LSPDB.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Impact of Delayed LSP Purging
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Impact of Delayed LSP Purging\n   The extensions defined in this document\
    \ may result in retaining an\n   LSP longer than its original lifetime.  In order\
    \ for this to occur,\n   the scheduled refresh of the LSP by the originator of\
    \ the LSP must\n   fail to occur -- this implies that the originator is no longer\n\
    \   reachable.  In such a case, its neighbors will update their own LSPs\n   to\
    \ report the loss of connectivity to the originator.  [ISO10589]\n   specifies\
    \ that LSPs from a node that is unreachable (failure of the\n   two-way connectivity\
    \ check) will not be used.  Note that this\n   behavior applies to ALL information\
    \ in the set of LSPs from such a\n   node.\n   Retention of stale LSPs therefore\
    \ has no negative side effects other\n   than requiring additional memory for\
    \ the LSPDB.  In networks where a\n   combination of pathological behaviors (e.g.,\
    \ LSP corruption and\n   frequent resetting of nodes in the network) is seen,\
    \ this could lead\n   to a large number of stale LSPs being retained, but such\
    \ networks are\n   already compromised.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The ability to introduce corrupt LSPs is not\
    \ altered by the rules\n   defined in this document.  Use of authentication as\
    \ defined in\n   [RFC5304] and [RFC5310] prevents such LSPs from being intentionally\n\
    \   introduced.  A man-in-the-middle attack that modifies an existing LSP\n  \
    \ by changing the Remaining Lifetime to a small value can cause\n   premature\
    \ purges even in the presence of cryptographic\n   authentication.  The mechanisms\
    \ defined in this document prevent such\n   an attack from being effective.\n"
