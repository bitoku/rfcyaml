  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) defines monitoring of\
    \ the received\n   (e.g., Adj-RIB-In) Routing Information Bases (RIBs) per peer.\
    \  The\n   pre-policy Adj-RIB-In conveys to a BMP receiver all RIB data before\n\
    \   any policy has been applied.  The post-policy Adj-RIB-In conveys to a\n  \
    \ BMP receiver all RIB data after policy filters and/or modifications\n   have\
    \ been applied.  An example of pre-policy versus post-policy is\n   when an inbound\
    \ policy applies attribute modification or filters.\n   Pre-policy would contain\
    \ information prior to the inbound policy\n   changes or filters of data.  Post-policy\
    \ would convey the changed\n   data or would not contain the filtered data.\n\
    \   Monitoring the received updates that the router received before any\n   policy\
    \ has been applied is the primary level of monitoring for most\n   use cases.\
    \  Inbound policy validation and auditing are the primary\n   use cases for enabling\
    \ post-policy monitoring.\n   In order for a BMP receiver to receive any BGP data,\
    \ the BMP sender\n   (e.g., router) needs to have an established BGP peering session\
    \ and\n   actively be receiving updates for an Adj-RIB-In.\n   Being able to only\
    \ monitor the Adj-RIB-In puts a restriction on what\n   data is available to BMP\
    \ receivers via BMP senders (e.g., routers).\n   This is an issue when the receiving\
    \ end of the BGP peer is not\n   enabled for BMP or when it is not accessible\
    \ for administrative\n   reasons.  For example, a service provider advertises\
    \ prefixes to a\n   customer, but the service provider cannot see what it advertises\
    \ via\n   BMP.  Asking the customer to enable BMP and monitoring of the Adj-\n\
    \   RIB-In are not feasible.\n   BMP [RFC7854] only defines Adj-RIB-In being sent\
    \ to BMP receivers.\n   This document updates the per-peer header defined in Section\
    \ 4.2 of\n   [RFC7854] by adding a new flag to distinguish between Adj-RIB-In\
    \ and\n   Adj-RIB-Out. BMP senders use the new flag to send either Adj-RIB-In\n\
    \   or Adj-RIB-Out.\n   Adding Adj-RIB-Out provides the ability for a BMP sender\
    \ to send to\n   BMP receivers what it advertises to BGP peers, which can be used\
    \ for\n   outbound policy validation and to monitor routes that were\n   advertised.\n"

- title: 4.  Per-Peer Header
  contents:
  - "4.  Per-Peer Header\n   The per-peer header has the same structure and flags\
    \ as defined in\n   Section 4.2 of [RFC7854] with the addition of the O flag as\
    \ shown\n   here:\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n   |V|L|A|O| Resv\
    \  |\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n   *  The O flag indicates Adj-RIB-In if set to 0\
    \ and Adj-RIB-Out if set\n      to 1.\n   The existing flags are defined in Section\
    \ 4.2 of [RFC7854], and the\n   remaining bits are reserved for future use.  They\
    \ MUST be transmitted\n   as 0, and their values MUST be ignored on receipt.\n\
    \   When the O flag is set to 1, the following fields in the per-peer\n   header\
    \ are redefined:\n   *  Peer Address: The remote IP address associated with the\
    \ TCP\n      session over which the encapsulated Protocol Data Unit (PDU) is\n\
    \      sent.\n   *  Peer AS: The Autonomous System number of the peer to which\
    \ the\n      encapsulated PDU is sent.\n   *  Peer BGP ID: The BGP Identifier\
    \ of the peer to which the\n      encapsulated PDU is sent.\n   *  Timestamp:\
    \ The time when the encapsulated routes were advertised\n      (one may also think\
    \ of this as the time when they were installed\n      in the Adj-RIB-Out), expressed\
    \ in seconds and microseconds since\n      midnight (zero hour), January 1, 1970\
    \ (UTC).  If zero, the time is\n      unavailable.  Precision of the timestamp\
    \ is implementation-\n      dependent.\n"

- title: 5.1.  Post-policy
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Post-policy\n   The primary use case in monitoring Adj-RIB-Out is to monitor\
    \ the\n   updates transmitted to a BGP peer after outbound policy has been\n \
    \  applied.  These updates reflect the result after modifications and\n   filters\
    \ have been applied (e.g., post-policy Adj-RIB-Out).  Some\n   attributes are\
    \ set when the BGP message is transmitted, such as next\n   hop.  Post-policy\
    \ Adj-RIB-Out MUST convey to the BMP receiver what is\n   actually transmitted\
    \ to the peer.\n   The L flag MUST be set to 1 to indicate post-policy.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Pre-policy
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Pre-policy\n   Similar to Adj-RIB-In policy validation, pre-policy Adj-RIB-Out\
    \ can\n   be used to validate and audit outbound policies.  For example, a\n \
    \  comparison between pre-policy and post-policy can be used to validate\n   the\
    \ outbound policy.\n   Depending on the BGP peering session type -- Internal BGP\
    \ (IBGP),\n   IBGP route reflector client, External BGP (EBGP), BGP confederations,\n\
    \   route server client -- the candidate routes that make up the pre-\n   policy\
    \ Adj-RIB-Out do not contain all local RIB routes.  Pre-policy\n   Adj-RIB-Out\
    \ conveys only routes that are available based on the\n   peering type.  Post-policy\
    \ represents the filtered/changed routes\n   from the available routes.\n   Some\
    \ attributes are set only during transmission of the BGP message,\n   i.e., post-policy.\
    \  It is common that the next hop may be null,\n   loopback, or similar during\
    \ the pre-policy phase.  All mandatory\n   attributes, such as next hop, MUST\
    \ be either zero or have an empty\n   length if they are unknown at the pre-policy\
    \ phase completion.  The\n   BMP receiver will treat zero or empty mandatory attributes\
    \ as self-\n   originated.\n   The L flag MUST be set to 0 to indicate pre-policy.\n"
- title: 6.  BMP Messages
  contents:
  - "6.  BMP Messages\n   Many BMP messages have a per-peer header, but some are not\
    \ applicable\n   to Adj-RIB-In or Adj-RIB-Out monitoring, such as Peer Up and\
    \ Down\n   Notifications.  Unless otherwise defined, the O flag should be set\
    \ to\n   0 in the per-peer header in BMP messages.\n"
- title: 6.1.  Route Monitoring and Route Mirroring
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Route Monitoring and Route Mirroring\n   The O flag MUST be set accordingly\
    \ to indicate if the route monitor\n   or route mirroring message conveys Adj-RIB-In\
    \ or Adj-RIB-Out.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Statistics Report
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Statistics Report\n   The Statistics Report message has a Stat Type field\
    \ to indicate the\n   statistic carried in the Stat Data field.  Statistics report\
    \ messages\n   are not specific to Adj-RIB-In or Adj-RIB-Out and MUST have the\
    \ O\n   flag set to zero.  The O flag SHOULD be ignored by the BMP receiver.\n\
    \   This document defines the following new statistics types:\n   *  Stat Type\
    \ = 14: Number of routes in pre-policy Adj-RIB-Out. This\n      statistics type\
    \ is 64-bit Gauge.\n   *  Stat Type = 15: Number of routes in post-policy Adj-RIB-Out.\
    \ This\n      statistics type is 64-bit Gauge.\n   *  Stat Type = 16: Number of\
    \ routes in per-AFI/SAFI pre-policy Adj-\n      RIB-Out.  The value is structured\

- title: 6.3.  Peer Up and Down Notifications
  contents:
  - "6.3.  Peer Up and Down Notifications\n   Peer Up and Down Notifications convey\
    \ BGP peering session state to\n   BMP receivers.  The state is independent of\
    \ whether or not route\n   monitoring or route mirroring messages will be sent\
    \ for Adj-RIB-In,\n   Adj-RIB-Out, or both.  BMP receiver implementations SHOULD\
    \ ignore the\n   O flag in Peer Up and Down Notifications.\n"

    \   field.  The value is administratively assigned.  There is no\n      requirement\
    \ to terminate the string with null or any other\n      character.\n      Multiple\
    \ Admin Labels can be included in the Peer Up Notification.\n      When multiple\
    \ Admin Labels are included, the BMP receiver MUST\n      preserve their order.\n\

- title: 7.1.  Peer and Update Groups
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Peer and Update Groups\n   Peer and update groups are used to group updates\
    \ shared by many\n   peers.  This is a level of efficiency in implementations,\
    \ not a true\n   representation of what is conveyed to a peer in either pre-policy\
    \ or\n   post-policy.\n   One of the use cases to monitor post-policy Adj-RIB-Out\
    \ is to\n   validate and continually ensure the egress updates match what is\n\
    \   expected.  For example, wholesale peers should never have routes with\n  \
    \ community X:Y sent to them.  In this use case, there may be hundreds\n   of\
    \ wholesale peers, but a single peer could have represented the\n   group.\n \
    \  From a BMP perspective, it should be simple to include a group name\n   in\
    \ the Peer Up, but it is more complex than that.  BGP\n   implementations have\
    \ evolved to provide comprehensive and structured\n   policy grouping, such as\
    \ session, AFI/SAFI, and template-based group\n   policy inheritances.\n   This\
    \ level of structure and inheritance of polices does not provide a\n   simple\
    \ peer group name or ID, such as wholesale peer.\n   This document defines a new\
    \ Admin Label type for Peer Up Information\n   TLVs (Section 6.3.1) that can be\
    \ used instead of requiring a group\n   name.  These labels have administrative\
    \ scope relevance.  For\n   example, labels \"type=wholesale\" and \"region=west\"\
    \ could be used to\n   monitor expected policies.\n   Configuration and assignment\
    \ of labels to peers are BGP\n   implementation-specific.\n"
