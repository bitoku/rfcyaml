  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   As an adjunct to the usual, two-way electronic mail service,\
    \ it is at\n   times useful to employ a one-way text notification service, called\n\
    \   radio paging.  This memo describes a technique for radio paging using\n  \
    \ the Internet mail infrastructure.  In particular, this memo focuses\n   on the\
    \ case in which radio pagers are identified via the\n   international telephone\
    \ network.\n   The technique described by this memo, mapping telephone numbers\
    \ to\n   domain names, is derived from the TPC.INT subdomain.  Consult RFC\n \
    \  1530, \"Principles of Operation for the TPC.INT Subdomain: General\n   Principles\
    \ and Policy\" for overview information.\n"
- title: 2.  Naming, Addressing, and Routing
  contents:
  - "2.  Naming, Addressing, and Routing\n   A radio pager is identified by a telephone\
    \ number, e.g.,\n     +1 415 940 8776\n   where \"+1\" indicates the IDDD country\
    \ code, and the remaining string\n   is a telephone number within that country.\n\
    \   In addition to a telephone number, a PIN may also be required to\n   uniquely\
    \ identify a radio pager.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Addressing
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Addressing\n   This number is used to construct the address of a radio\
    \ paging\n   server, which forms the recipient address for the message, e.g.,\
    \ one\n   of:\n     pager.ATOM@6.7.7.8.0.4.9.5.1.4.1.tpc.int\n     pager-alpha.ATOM@6.7.7.8.0.4.9.5.1.4.1.tpc.int\n\
    \     pager-numeric@6.7.7.8.0.4.9.5.1.4.1.tpc.int\n   where \"ATOM\" is an RFC\
    \ 822 atom [1], an opaque string for use in\n   recipient identification when\
    \ communicating with the paging network,\n   and the domain-part is constructed\
    \ by reversing the telephone number,\n   converting each digit to a domain-label,\
    \ and being placed under\n   \"tpc.int\".  (The telephone number must not include\
    \ any international\n   access codes.)\n   Note that the mailbox syntax is purposefully\
    \ restricted in the\n   interests of pragmatism.  To paraphrase STD 11, RFC 822,\
    \ an atom is\n   defined as:\n     atom    = 1*atomchar\n     atomchar=   <any\
    \ upper or lowercase alphabetic character\n                  (A-Z a-z)>\n    \
    \           / <any digit (0-9)>\n               / \"!\" / \"#\" / \"$\" / \"%\"\
    \ / \"&\" / \"'\" / \"*\" / \"+\"\n               / \"-\" / \"/\" / \"=\" / \"\
    ?\" / \"^\" / \"_\" / \"`\" / \"{\"\n               / \"|\" / \"}\" / \"~\"\n\
    \   Finally, note that some Internet mail software (especially gateways\n   from\
    \ outside the Internet) impose stringent limitations on the size\n   of a mailbox-string.\
    \  Thus, originating user agents should take care\n   in limiting the local-part\
    \ to no more than 70 or so characters.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Routing
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Routing\n   The message is routed in exactly the same fashion as all other\n\
    \   electronic mail, i.e., using the MX algorithm [2].  Since a radio\n   paging\
    \ server might be able to access many radio pagers, the\n   wildcarding facilities\
    \ of the DNS [3,4] are used accordingly.  For\n   example, if a radio paging server\
    \ residing at \"dbc.mtview.ca.us\" is\n   willing to access any radio pager with\
    \ a telephone number prefix of\n     +1 415 940\n   then this resource record\
    \ might be present\n     *.0.4.9.5.1.4.1.tpc.int.       IN MX 10 dbc.mtview.ca.us.\n\
    \   Naturally, if several radio paging servers were willing to access any\n  \
    \ radio pager in that prefix, multiple MX resource records would be\n   present.\
    \  (The DNS servers for the TPC.INT subdomain perform a\n   rudimentary form of\
    \ load balancing by rotating the order of the MX\n   records returned on each\
    \ query.)\n   It should be noted that the presence of a wildcard RR which matches\
    \ a\n   radio paging server's address does not imply that the corresponding\n\
    \   telephone number is valid, or, if valid, that a radio pager is\n   identified\
    \ by the phone number.  Rather, the presence of a wildcard\n   RR indicates that\
    \ a radio paging server is willing to attempt access.\n"
- title: 3.  Procedure
  contents:
  - "3.  Procedure\n   When information is to be sent to a radio pager, the user application\n\
    \   constructs an RFC 822 message, containing a \"Message-ID\" field and a\n \
    \  textual content (e.g., a \"text/plain\" content [5]).\n   The message is then\
    \ sent to the radio paging server's electronic mail\n   address.  The radio paging\
    \ server begins by looking at the local part\n   of the address.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Alpha-numeric Radio Pagers
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Alpha-numeric Radio Pagers\n   If the local-part is either \"pager.ATOM\"\
    \ or \"pager-alpha.ATOM\" then\n   this indicates that the recipient is using\
    \ an alpha-numeric radio\n   pager, and ATOM either identifies a paging network\
    \ (CARRIER), or a\n   radio pager identity number (PIN), or both, according to\
    \ these rules:\n   (1)  if ATOM consists entirely of numeric characters, then\
    \ ATOM is a\n        PIN, and the domain-part refers to the IXO access telephone\n\
    \        number for a radio paging carrier; otherwise,\n   (2)  if ATOM does not\
    \ contain a hyphen character (\"-\"), then ATOM is\n        a CARRIER, a local\
    \ database is consulted to determine the\n        corresponding IXO access telephone\
    \ number, and the telephone\n        number corresponding to the domain-part is\
    \ used to identify the\n        radio pager; otherwise,\n   (3)  if ATOM does\
    \ contain a hyphen character (\"-\"), then everything\n        to the left of\
    \ the first hyphen is a CARRIER, and everything to\n        the right of that\
    \ hyphen is a PIN, a local database is consulted\n        to determine the corresponding\
    \ IXO access telephone number, and\n        the PIN is used is used to identify\
    \ the radio pager.\n   If the local-part starts with \"pager.\", then the message\
    \ sent to the\n   radio pager consists of the body of the message; otherwise,\
    \ if the\n   local-part starts with \"pager-alpha.\", then the radio paging server\n\
    \   determines which information in the headers and body of the message\n   are\
    \ used when constructing the paging message.  For example, some\n   radio paging\
    \ servers might choose to examine the \"To\" and \"Subject\"\n   fields, in addition\
    \ to the body, whilst other radio paging servers\n   might choose to simply send\
    \ the body verbatim.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Numeric Radio Pagers
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Numeric Radio Pagers\n   If the local-part is the literal string \"pager-numeric\"\
    \ then this\n   indicates that the recipient is using a numeric pager, and the\
    \ radio\n   pager dials the telephone number corresponding to the domain-part.\n\
    \   The message sent to the radio pager consists of the body of the\n   message,\
    \ which must consist solely of digits.\n"
- title: 3.3.  MAILing versus SENDing
  contents:
  - "3.3.  MAILing versus SENDing\n   An SMTP client communicating with a radio paging\
    \ server may use\n   attempt either the MAIL or SEND command.  The radio paging\
    \ server\n   MUST support the MAIL command, and MAY support any of the SEND, SOML,\n\
    \   or SAML commands.\n   If the MAIL command is used, then a positive completion\
    \ reply to both\n   the RCPT and DATA commands indicates, at a minimum, that the\
    \ message\n   has been queued for transmission into the radio paging network for\n\
    \   the recipient, but is at least queued for transmission into the radio\n  \
    \ paging network.\n   If the SEND command is used, then a positive completion\
    \ reply to both\n   the RCPT and DATA commands indicates that the message has\
    \ been\n   accepted by the radio paging network for delivery to the recipient.\n\
    \   If the SOML or SAML command is used, then a positive completion reply\n  \
    \ to both the RCPT and DATA commands indicates that the message may\n   have been\
    \ accepted by the radio paging network for delivery to the\n   recipient.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Latency
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Latency\n   Although the Internet electronic mail service tends to perform\n\
    \   delivery in a timely and reliable manner, some paging services will\n   wish\
    \ to provide a higher degree of assurance to their clients, in\n   particular\
    \ guaranteeing that a positive reply code means that the\n   page has been sent\
    \ on the radio paging network.  For such\n   requirements, the primary constraints\
    \ are server implementation and\n   client/server network connectivity.\n   A\
    \ client that uses the SEND or SAML commands is explicitly requesting\n   real-time\
    \ transmission on the radio paging network and is requiring\n   that the server\
    \ reply code will carry a statement of success or\n   failure about that transmission.\n\
    \   The IP level of the Internet performs datagram store-and-forward\n   service,\
    \ but gives the end system hosts the appearance of direct\n   connectivity, by\
    \ virtue of allowing interactive service.  The\n   Internet electronic mail service\
    \ adds another layer of store-and-\n   forward indirection, so that messages may\
    \ go through any number of\n   relays (and/or gateways).  This may introduce arbitrarily\
    \ large\n   delays of minutes, hours, or days.\n   A client that configures their\
    \ Internet attachment to permit \"direct\"\n   SMTP connectivity to a radio paging\
    \ server will be able to submit\n   paging requests to the server directly, without\
    \ additional SMTP-\n   relaying. That is, transmission from radio paging client\
    \ to server\n   will be one \"SMTP-hop\"only.  This will eliminate any possibility\
    \ of\n   non-deterministic delay by the Internet itself.\n   The combination of\
    \ configuring radio paging server and client to\n   allow direct IP/SMTP-level\
    \ interaction and ensuring that they use\n   SEND or SAML commands only will mean\
    \ that a client receiving a\n   positive reply from the server is assured that\
    \ the page has been sent\n   on the radio paging network.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Usage Examples\n   These examples make use of the \"iddd.tpc.int\" subdomain.\
    \  The DNS\n   servers for this subdomain, upon encountering a domain of the form:\n\

- title: 5.  Server Configuration Example
  contents:
  - "5.  Server Configuration Example\n   A hypothetical radio paging carrier, e.g.,\n\
    \     Pigeon Paging\n   might choose to integrate its radio paging services with\
    \ Internet e-\n   mail in the following fashion:\n   (1)  The radio paging carrier\
    \ establishes a top-level domain name,\n        e.g.,\n             pigeon.net\n\
    \   (2)  The radio paging carrier installs and operates one or more\n        radio\
    \ paging servers, each having a unique entry in the DNS,\n         e.g.,\n   \
    \          ixo1.pigeon.net.              IN A  a.b.c.d\n        Each of these\
    \ radio paging servers runs an SMTP server which\n        implements the SEND\
    \ command as described in Section 3.3 above.\n   (3)  The radio paging carrier\
    \ coordinates with the administrators of\n        the TPC.INT subdomain to have\
    \ the appropriate MX records added\n        to the DNS, assigning cost values\
    \ in the MX records to reflect\n        any difference in the quality of service\
    \ between the radio\n        paging servers, e.g.,\n             4.3.2.1.5.5.5.0.0.8.1.tpc.int.\
    \ IN MX  5 ixo1.pigeon.net.\n             4.3.2.1.5.5.5.0.0.8.1.tpc.int. IN MX\
    \  5 ixo2.pigeon.net.\n        which would provide both load-balancing and redundancy\n\
    \        (particularly if the servers were located at different points in\n  \
    \      the Internet).  At this point, messages can be sent using the\n       \
    \ addressing formats described in Section 2.2 above.\n   (4)  The radio paging\
    \ carrier may choose to make available a client\n        program which uses the\
    \ SMTP SEND command, in order to achieve\n        \"real-time\" delivery of messages\
    \ into the radio paging network.\n   (5)  Finally, the radio paging carry may\
    \ choose to assign each of its\n        customers a mailbox, e.g.,\n         \
    \    mrose@pager.pigeon.net\n        which maps to the TPC.INT address for the\
    \ customer's radio pager.\n        The system(s) listed in the DNS for this domain\
    \ would maintain\n        the appropriate mail aliases for this mapping, e.g.,\n\
    \             R: 220 pager.pigeon.net SMTP ready\n             S: HELO malamud.com\n\
    \             R: 220 pager.pigeon.net\n             S: EXPN mrose\n          \
    \   R: 250 <pager-alpha.98765@18005551234.iddd.tpc.int>\n        At the carrier's\
    \ discretion, these systems may also be the\n        systems running the radio\
    \ paging servers.  However, this needn't\n        be the case.  For example, consider\
    \ a situation where a client\n        program which uses the SMTP SEND command,\
    \ wants to ensure that it\n        is talking to radio paging server for an address:\
    \ e.g.,\n             R: 220 pager.pigeon.net SMTP ready\n             S: EHLO\
    \ malamud.com\n             R: 220-pager.pigeon.net\n             R: 220 SEND\n\
    \             S: VRFY mrose\n             R: 551 User not local;\n           \
    \          try <pager-alpha.98765@18005551234.iddd.tpc.int>\n        or\n    \
    \         R: 220 pager.pigeon.net SMTP ready\n             S: EHLO malamud.com\n\
    \             R: 220-pager.pigeon.net\n             R: 220 SEND\n            \
    \ S: VRFY mrose\n             R: 250 <pager-alpha.98765@18005551234.iddd.tpc.int>\n"
