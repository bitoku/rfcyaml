- title: 1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.  Overview\n   There are a number of systems (for example, [RBRIDGES], [802.1aq],\n\
    \   and [OTV]) that use Layer-2 addresses carried in a link state routing\n  \
    \ protocol, specifically Intermediate System to Intermediate System\n   [IS-IS]\
    \ [RFC1195], to provide true Layer-2 routing.  In almost all\n   the technologies\
    \ mentioned above, classical Layer-2 packets are\n   encapsulated with an outer\
    \ header.  The outer header format varies\n   across all these technologies. \
    \ This outer header is used to route\n   the encapsulated packets to their destination.\n\
    \   Each Intermediate System (IS) advertises one or more IS-IS Link State\n  \
    \ Protocol Data Units (PDUs) with routing information.  Each Link State\n   PDU\
    \ (LSP) is composed of a fixed header and a number of tuples, each\n   consisting\
    \ of a Type, a Length, and a Value.  Such tuples are\n   commonly known as TLVs.\
    \  In this document, we specify a set of TLVs\n   to be added to [IS-IS] PDUs,\
    \ to support these proposed systems.  The\n   TLVs are generic Layer-2 additions,\
    \ and specific ones, as needed, are\n   defined in the IS-IS technology-specific\
    \ extensions.  This document\n   does not propose any new forwarding mechanisms\
    \ using this additional\n   information carried within IS-IS.\n"

    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  TLV Enhancements to IS-IS
  contents:
  - "2.  TLV Enhancements to IS-IS\n   This section specifies the enhancements for\
    \ the TLVs that are needed\n   in common by Layer-2 technologies.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Multi-Topology-Aware Port Capability TLV
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Multi-Topology-Aware Port Capability TLV\n   The Multi-Topology-aware Port\
    \ Capability (MT-PORT-CAP) is IS-IS TLV\n   type 143 and has the following format:\n\
    \   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n   | Type=MTPORTCAP|                  (1 byte)\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\

    \   o  Type: TLV Type, set to MT-PORT-CAP TLV 143.\n   o  Length: Total number\
    \ of bytes contained in the value field,\n      including the length of the sub-TLVs\
    \ carried in this TLV.\n   o  R: Reserved 4 bits, MUST be sent as zero and ignored\
    \ on receipt.\n   o  Topology Identifier: MT ID is a 12-bit field containing the\
    \ MT ID\n      of the topology being announced.  This field when set to zero\n\
    \      implies that it is being used to carry base topology information.\n   o\
    \  Sub-TLVs: The MT-PORT-CAP TLV value contains sub-TLVs formatted as\n      described\
    \ in [RFC5305].  They are defined in the technology-\n      specific documents.\n\
    \   The MT-PORT-CAP TLV may occur multiple times and is carried within an\n  \
    \ IS-IS Hello (IIH) PDU.\n"
- title: 2.2.  The MAC-Reachability TLV
  contents:
  - "2.2.  The MAC-Reachability TLV\n   The MAC-Reachability (MAC-RI) TLV is IS-IS\
    \ TLV type 147 and has the\n   following format:\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n   | Type=\
    \ MAC-RI  |                  (1 byte)\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n   |   Length   \

    \   |                          MAC (N)       (6 bytes)                 |\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-...+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \   o  Type: TLV Type, set to 147 (MAC-RI).\n   o  Length: Total number of bytes\
    \ contained in the value field given\n      by 5 + 6*n bytes.\n   o  Topology-id/Nickname\
    \ : Depending on the technology in which it is\n      used, this carries the topology-id\
    \ or nickname.  When this field\n      is set to zero, this implies that the Media\
    \ Access Control (MAC)\n      addresses are reachable across all topologies or\
    \ across all\n      nicknames of the originating IS.\n   o  Confidence: This carries\
    \ an 8-bit quantity indicating the\n      confidence level in the MAC addresses\
    \ being transported.  Whether\n      this field is used, and its semantics if\
    \ used, are further defined\n      by the specific protocol using Layer-2 IS-IS.\
    \  If not used, it\n      MUST be set to zero on transmission and be ignored on\
    \ receipt.\n   o  RESV: (4 bits) MUST be sent as zero and ignored on receipt.\n\
    \   o  VLAN-ID: This carries a 12-bit VLAN identifier that is valid for\n    \
    \  all subsequent MAC addresses in this TLV, or the value zero if no\n      VLAN\
    \ is specified.\n   o  MAC(i): This is the 48-bit MAC address reachable from the\
    \ IS that\n      is announcing this TLV.\n   The MAC-RI TLV is carried in a standard\
    \ Link State PDU (LSP).  This\n   TLV can be carried multiple times in an LSP\
    \ and in multiple LSPs.  It\n   MUST contain only unicast addresses.  The manner\
    \ in which these TLVs\n   are generated by the various Layer-2 routing technologies\
    \ and the\n   manner in which they are consumed are detailed in the technology-\n\
    \   specific documents.\n   In most of the technologies, these MAC-RI TLVs will\
    \ translate to\n   populating the hardware with these entries and with appropriate\
    \ next-\n   hop information as derived from the advertising IS.\n"
