  - "Abstract\n   Secure DNS is based on cryptographic techniques.  A necessary part\
    \ of\n   the strength of these techniques is careful attention to the\n   operational\
    \ aspects of key and signature generation, lifetime, size,\n   and storage.  In\
    \ addition, special attention must be paid to the\n   security of the high level\
    \ zones, particularly the root zone.  This\n   document discusses these operational\
    \ aspects for keys and signatures\n   used in connection with the KEY and SIG\

- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   This document describes operational considerations for the\n\
    \   generation, lifetime, size, and storage of DNS cryptographic keys and\n  \
    \ signatures for use in the KEY and SIG resource records [RFC 2535].\n   Particular\
    \ attention is paid to high level zones and the root zone.\n"
- title: 2. Public/Private Key Generation
  contents:
  - "2. Public/Private Key Generation\n   Careful generation of all keys is a sometimes\
    \ overlooked but\n   absolutely essential element in any cryptographically secure\
    \ system.\n   The strongest algorithms used with the longest keys are still of\
    \ no\n   use if an adversary can guess enough to lower the size of the likely\n\
    \   key space so that it can be exhaustively searched.  Technical\n   suggestions\
    \ for the generation of random keys will be found in [RFC\n   1750].\n   Long\
    \ term keys are particularly sensitive as they will represent a\n   more valuable\
    \ target and be subject to attack for a longer time than\n   short period keys.\
    \  It is strongly recommended that long term key\n   generation occur off-line\
    \ in a manner isolated from the network via\n   an air gap or, at a minimum, high\
    \ level secure hardware.\n"
- title: 3. Public/Private Key Lifetimes
  contents:
  - "3. Public/Private Key Lifetimes\n   No key should be used forever.  The longer\
    \ a key is in use, the\n   greater the probability that it will have been compromised\
    \ through\n   carelessness, accident, espionage, or cryptanalysis.  Furthermore,\
    \ if\n   key rollover is a rare event, there is an increased risk that, when\n\
    \   the time does come to change the key, no one at the site will\n   remember\
    \ how to do it or operational problems will have developed in\n   the key rollover\
    \ procedures.\n   While public key lifetime is a matter of local policy, these\n\
    \   considerations imply that, unless there are extraordinary\n   circumstances,\
    \ no long term key should have a lifetime significantly\n   over four years. \
    \ In fact, a reasonable guideline for long term keys\n   that are kept off-line\
    \ and carefully guarded is a 13 month lifetime\n   with the intent that they be\
    \ replaced every year.  A reasonable\n   maximum lifetime for keys that are used\
    \ for transaction security or\n   the like and are kept on line is 36 days with\
    \ the intent that they be\n   replaced monthly or more often.  In many cases,\
    \ a key lifetime of\n   somewhat over a day may be reasonable.\n   On the other\
    \ hand, public keys with too short a lifetime can lead to\n   excessive resource\
    \ consumption in re-signing data and retrieving\n   fresh information because\
    \ cached information becomes stale.  In the\n   Internet environment, almost all\
    \ public keys should have lifetimes no\n   shorter than three minutes, which is\
    \ a reasonable estimate of maximum\n   packet delay even in unusual circumstances.\n"
- title: 4. Public/Private Key Size Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Public/Private Key Size Considerations\n   There are a number of factors that\
    \ effect public key size choice for\n   use in the DNS security extension.  Unfortunately,\
    \ these factors\n   usually do not all point in the same direction.  Choice of\
    \ zone key\n   size should generally be made by the zone administrator depending\
    \ on\n   their local conditions.\n   For most schemes, larger keys are more secure\
    \ but slower.  In\n   addition, larger keys increase the size of the KEY and SIG\
    \ RRs.  This\n   increases the chance of DNS UDP packet overflow and the possible\n\
    \   necessity for using higher overhead TCP in responses.\n"
- title: 4.1 RSA Key Sizes
  contents:
  - "4.1 RSA Key Sizes\n   Given a small public exponent, verification (the most common\n\
    \   operation) for the MD5/RSA algorithm will vary roughly with the\n   square\
    \ of the modulus length, signing will vary with the cube of the\n   modulus length,\
    \ and key generation (the least common operation) will\n   vary with the fourth\
    \ power of the modulus length.  The current best\n   algorithms for factoring\
    \ a modulus and breaking RSA security vary\n   roughly with the 1.6 power of the\
    \ modulus itself.  Thus going from a\n   640 bit modulus to a 1280 bit modulus\
    \ only increases the verification\n   time by a factor of 4 but may increase the\
    \ work factor of breaking\n   the key by over 2^900.\n   The recommended minimum\
    \ RSA algorithm modulus size is 704 bits which\n   is believed by the author to\
    \ be secure at this time.  But high level\n   zones in the DNS tree may wish to\
    \ set a higher minimum, perhaps 1000\n   bits, for security reasons.  (Since the\
    \ United States National\n   Security Agency generally permits export of encryption\
    \ systems using\n   an RSA modulus of up to 512 bits, use of that small a modulus,\
    \ i.e.\n   n, must be considered weak.)\n   For an RSA key used only to secure\
    \ data and not to secure other keys,\n   704 bits should be adequate at this time.\n"
- title: 4.2 DSS Key Sizes
  contents:
  - "4.2 DSS Key Sizes\n   DSS keys are probably roughly as strong as an RSA key of\
    \ the same\n   length but DSS signatures are significantly smaller.\n"
- title: 5. Private Key Storage
  contents:
  - "5. Private Key Storage\n   It is recommended that, where possible, zone private\
    \ keys and the\n   zone file master copy be kept and used in off-line, non-network\n\
    \   connected, physically secure machines only.  Periodically an\n   application\
    \ can be run to add authentication to a zone by adding SIG\n   and NXT RRs and\
    \ adding no-key type KEY RRs for subzones/algorithms\n   where a real KEY RR for\
    \ the subzone with that algorithm is not\n   provided. Then the augmented file\
    \ can be transferred, perhaps by\n   sneaker-net, to the networked zone primary\
    \ server machine.\n   The idea is to have a one way information flow to the network\
    \ to\n   avoid the possibility of tampering from the network.  Keeping the\n \
    \  zone master file on-line on the network and simply cycling it through\n   an\
    \ off-line signer does not do this.  The on-line version could still\n   be tampered\
    \ with if the host it resides on is compromised.  For\n   maximum security, the\
    \ master copy of the zone file should be off net\n   and should not be updated\
    \ based on an unsecured network mediated\n   communication.\n   This is not possible\
    \ if the zone is to be dynamically updated\n   securely [RFC 2137]. At least a\
    \ private key capable of updating the\n   SOA and NXT chain must be on line in\
    \ that case.\n   Secure resolvers must be configured with some trusted on-line\
    \ public\n   key information (or a secure path to such a resolver) or they will\
    \ be\n   unable to authenticate.  Although on line, this public key\n   information\
    \ must be protected or it could be altered so that spoofed\n   DNS data would\
    \ appear authentic.\n   Non-zone private keys, such as host or user keys, generally\
    \ have to\n   be kept on line to be used for real-time purposes such as DNS\n\
    \   transaction security.\n"
- title: 6. High Level Zones, The Root Zone, and The Meta-Root Key
  contents:
  - "6. High Level Zones, The Root Zone, and The Meta-Root Key\n   Higher level zones\
    \ are generally more sensitive than lower level\n   zones.  Anyone controlling\
    \ or breaking the security of a zone thereby\n   obtains authority over all of\
    \ its subdomains (except in the case of\n   resolvers that have locally configured\
    \ the public key of a\n   subdomain).  Therefore, extra care should be taken with\
    \ high level\n   zones and strong keys used.\n   The root zone is the most critical\
    \ of all zones.  Someone controlling\n   or compromising the security of the root\
    \ zone would control the\n   entire DNS name space of all resolvers using that\
    \ root zone (except\n   in the case of resolvers that have locally configured\
    \ the public key\n   of a subdomain). Therefore, the utmost care must be taken\
    \ in the\n   securing of the root zone. The strongest and most carefully handled\n\
    \   keys should be used.  The root zone private key should always be kept\n  \
    \ off line.\n   Many resolvers will start at a root server for their access to\
    \ and\n   authentication of DNS data.  Securely updating an enormous population\n\
    \   of resolvers around the world will be extremely difficult.  Yet the\n   guidelines\
    \ in section 3 above would imply that the root zone private\n   key be changed\
    \ annually or more often and if it were staticly\n   configured at all these resolvers,\
    \ it would have to be updated when\n   changed.\n   To permit relatively frequent\
    \ change to the root zone key yet\n   minimize exposure of the ultimate key of\
    \ the DNS tree, there will be\n   a \"meta-root\" key used very rarely and then\
    \ only to sign a sequence\n   of regular root key RRsets with overlapping time\
    \ validity periods\n   that are to be rolled out. The root zone contains the meta-root\
    \ and\n   current regular root KEY RR(s) signed by SIG RRs under both the\n  \
    \ meta-root and other root private key(s) themselves.\n   The utmost security\
    \ in the storage and use of the meta-root key is\n   essential.  The exact techniques\
    \ are precautions to be used are\n   beyond the scope of this document.  Because\
    \ of its special position,\n   it may be best to continue with the same meta-root\
    \ key for an\n   extended period of time such as ten to fifteen years.\n"
