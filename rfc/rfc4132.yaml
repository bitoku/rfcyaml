  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites\
    \ to the TLS\n   protocol [TLS] to support the Camellia encryption algorithm as\
    \ a bulk\n   cipher algorithm.  This proposal provides a new option for fast and\n\
    \   efficient bulk cipher algorithms.\n   Note: This work was done when the first\

- title: 1.1.  Camellia
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Camellia\n   Camellia was selected as a recommended cryptographic primitive\
    \ by the\n   EU NESSIE (New European Schemes for Signatures, Integrity and\n \
    \  Encryption) project [NESSIE] and included in the list of\n   cryptographic\
    \ techniques for Japanese e-Government systems, which\n   were selected by the\
    \ Japan CRYPTREC (Cryptography Research and\n   Evaluation Committees) [CRYPTREC].\
    \  Camellia is also included in\n   specification of the TV-Anytime Forum [TV-ANYTIME].\
    \  The TV-Anytime\n   Forum is an association of organizations that seeks to develop\n\
    \   specifications to enable audio-visual and other services based on\n   mass-market\
    \ high-volume digital storage in consumer platforms.\n   Camellia is specified\
    \ as Cipher Suite in TLS used by Phase 1 S-7\n   (Bi-directional Metadata Delivery\
    \ Protection) specification and S-5\n   (TV-Anytime Rights Management and Protection\
    \ Information for\n   Broadcast Applications) specification.  Camellia has been\
    \ submitted\n   to other several standardization bodies such as ISO (ISO/IEC 18033)\n\
    \   and IETF S/MIME Mail Security Working Group [Camellia-CMS].\n   Camellia supports\
    \ 128-bit block size and 128-, 192-, and 256-bit key\n   sizes; i.e., the same\
    \ interface specifications as the Advanced\n   Encryption Standard (AES) [AES].\n\
    \   Camellia was jointly developed by NTT and Mitsubishi Electric\n   Corporation\
    \ in 2000 [CamelliaTech].  It was carefully designed to\n   withstand all known\
    \ cryptanalytic attacks and even to have a\n   sufficiently large security leeway.\
    \  It has been scrutinized by\n   worldwide cryptographic experts.\n   Camellia\
    \ was also designed to be suitable for both software and\n   hardware implementations\
    \ and to cover all possible encryption\n   applications, from low-cost smart cards\
    \ to high-speed network\n   systems.  Compared to the AES, Camellia offers at\
    \ least comparable\n   encryption speed in software and hardware.  In addition,\
    \ a\n   distinguishing feature is its small hardware design.  Camellia\n   perfectly\
    \ meets one of the current TLS market requirements, for which\n   low power consumption\
    \ is mandatory.\n   The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described\
    \ in\n   [Camellia-Desc].  The Camellia homepage,\n   http://info.isl.ntt.co.jp/camellia/,\
    \ contains a wealth of information\n   about camellia, including detailed specification,\
    \ security analysis,\n   performance figures, reference implementation, and test\
    \ vectors.\n"
