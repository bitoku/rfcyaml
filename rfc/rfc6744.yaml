  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is part of the ILNP document set, which has\
    \ had\n   extensive review within the IRTF Routing RG.  ILNP is one of the\n \
    \  recommendations made by the RG Chairs.  Separately, various refereed\n   research\
    \ papers on ILNP have also been published during this decade.\n   So, the ideas\
    \ contained herein have had much broader review than the\n   IRTF Routing RG.\
    \  The views in this document were considered\n   controversial by the Routing\
    \ RG, but the RG reached a consensus that\n   the document still should be published.\
    \  The Routing RG has had\n   remarkably little consensus on anything, so virtually\
    \ all Routing RG\n   outputs are considered controversial.\n   At present, the\
    \ Internet research and development community is\n   exploring various approaches\
    \ to evolving the Internet Architecture to\n   solve a variety of issues including,\
    \ but not limited to, scalability\n   of inter-domain routing [RFC4984].  A wide\
    \ range of other issues\n   (e.g., site multihoming, node multihoming, site/subnet\
    \ mobility, node\n   mobility) are also active concerns at present.  Several different\n\
    \   classes of evolution are being considered by the Internet research\n   and\
    \ development community.  One class is often called \"Map and\n   Encapsulate\"\
    , where traffic would be mapped and then tunnelled\n   through the inter-domain\
    \ core of the Internet.  Another class being\n   considered is sometimes known\
    \ as \"Identifier/Locator Split\".  This\n   document relates to a proposal that\
    \ is in the latter class of\n   evolutionary approaches.\n   This document describes\
    \ a new option for the IPv6 Destination Options\n   header that is used with the\
    \ Identifier-Locator Network Protocol for\n   IPv6 (ILNPv6).  ILNPv6 is an experimental\
    \ protocol that is backwards\n   compatible with, and incrementally upgradable\
    \ from, IPv6.  This\n   option is ONLY used in ILNPv6 sessions and is never used\
    \ with classic\n   IPv6 sessions.\n   The Nonce Option for the IPv6 Destination\
    \ Options Header that is\n   described in this document provides two functions.\
    \  First, it\n   provides protection against off-path attacks for packets when\
    \ ILNPv6\n   is in use.  Second, it provides a signal during initial network-layer\n\
    \   session creation that ILNPv6 is proposed for use with this network-\n   layer\
    \ session, rather than classic IPv6.  This last function is\n   particularly important\
    \ for ensuring that ILNP is both incrementally\n   deployable and backwards compatible\
    \ with IPv6.  Consequently, this\n   option MUST NOT be used except by an ILNPv6-capable\
    \ node.\n   Further, each Nonce value is unidirectional.  Since packets often\n\
    \   travel asymmetric paths between two correspondents, having separate\n   Nonces\
    \ for each direction limits the number of on-path nodes that can\n   easily learn\
    \ an ILNP session's nonce.  So a typical TCP session will\n   have two different\
    \ nonce values in use: one nonce is used from Local\n   Node to the Correspondent\
    \ Node and a different nonce is used from the\n   Correspondent Node to the Local\
    \ Node.\n"

  - "1.1.  ILNP Document Roadmap\n   This document defines a new IPv6 Nonce Destination\
    \ Option used by\n   ILNPv6 nodes (1) to indicate to ILNP correspondent nodes\
    \ (by\n   inclusion within the initial packets of an ILNP session) that the\n\
    \   node is operating in the ILNP mode and (2) to prevent off-path\n   attacks\
    \ against ILNP ICMP messages.  This Nonce is used, for example,\n   with all ILNP\
    \ ICMPv6 Locator Update messages that are exchanged among\n   ILNP correspondent\
    \ nodes.\n   The ILNP architecture can have more than one engineering\n   instantiation.\
    \  For example, one can imagine a \"clean-slate\"\n   engineering design based\
    \ on the ILNP architecture.  In separate\n   documents, we describe two specific\
    \ engineering instances of ILNP.\n   The term \"ILNPv6\" refers precisely to an\
    \ instance of ILNP that is\n   based upon, and backwards compatible with, IPv6.\
    \  The term \"ILNPv4\"\n   refers precisely to an instance of ILNP that is based\
    \ upon, and\n   backwards compatible with, IPv4.\n   Many engineering aspects\
    \ common to both ILNPv4 and ILNPv6 are\n   described in [RFC6741].  A full engineering\
    \ specification for either\n   ILNPv6 or ILNPv4 is beyond the scope of this document.\n\
    \   Readers are referred to other related ILNP documents for details not\n   described\
    \ here:\n   a) [RFC6740] is the main architectural description of ILNP, including\n\
    \      the concept of operations.\n   b) [RFC6741] describes engineering and implementation\
    \ considerations\n      that are common to both ILNPv4 and ILNPv6.\n   c) [RFC6742]\
    \ defines additional DNS resource records that support\n      ILNP.\n   d) [RFC6743]\
    \ defines a new ICMPv6 Locator Update message used by an\n      ILNP node to inform\
    \ its correspondent nodes of any changes to its\n      set of valid Locators.\n\
    \   e) [RFC6745] defines a new ICMPv4 Locator Update message used by an\n    \
    \  ILNP node to inform its correspondent nodes of any changes to its\n      set\
    \ of valid Locators.\n   f) [RFC6746] defines a new IPv4 Nonce Option used by\
    \ ILNPv4 nodes to\n      carry a security nonce to prevent off-path attacks against\
    \ ILNP\n      ICMP messages and also defines a new IPv4 Identifier Option used\n\
    \      by ILNPv4 nodes.\n   g) [RFC6747] describes extensions to Address Resolution\
    \ Protocol\n      (ARP) for use with ILNPv4.\n   h) [RFC6748] describes optional\
    \ engineering and deployment functions\n      for ILNP.  These are not required\
    \ for the operation or use of ILNP\n      and are provided as additional options.\n"

- title: 2.  Syntax
  contents:
  - "2.  Syntax\n   The Nonce Option is carried within an IPv6 Destination Options\n\
    \   header.  Section 4 of [RFC2460] provides much more information on the\n  \
    \ various options and optional headers used with IPv6.\n   More than one option\
    \ might be inside the IPv6 Destination Options\n   Header; however, at most, one\
    \ Nonce Option exists in a given IPv6\n   packet.\n   A system that receives a\
    \ packet containing more than one Nonce Option\n   SHOULD discard the packet as\
    \ \"Authentication Failed\" (instead of\n   passing the packet up to the appropriate\
    \ transport-layer protocol or\n   to ICMP) and SHOULD log the event, including\
    \ the Source Locator,\n   Source Identifier, Destination Locator, Destination\
    \ Identifier,\n   upper-layer protocol (e.g., OSPF, TCP, UDP) if any, and transport-\n\
    \   layer port numbers (if any), as a security fault in accordance with\n   local\
    \ logging policies.\n   As of this writing, IPv6 Destination Options headers,\
    \ and the options\n   carried by such headers, are extremely uncommon in the deployed\n\
    \   Internet.  So, it is expected that this Nonce Option commonly would\n   be\
    \ the only IPv6 Destination Option present in a given IPv6 packet.\n   If a Common\

  - "3.  Transport Protocol Effects\n   When the initial packet(s) of an IPv6 session\

    \   discussed in more detail in Section 6 below.)\n   When a network-layer session\
    \ is using ILNPv6, the transport-layer\n   pseudo-header calculations MUST set\
    \ to zero the high-order 64-bits\n   (\"Locator\" or \"Routing Prefix\") of each\
    \ IPv6 address.  This has the\n   effect that the transport-layer is no longer\
    \ aware of the topological\n   network location of either node in that transport-layer\
    \ session.\n   The preceding rule applies not only to unicast ILNPv6 sessions\
    \ but\n   also to multicast or anycast ILNPv6 sessions.\n"
- title: 4.  Location Changes
  contents:
  - "4.  Location Changes\n   When a node has a change in its Locator set that causes\
    \ all\n   previously valid Locators to become invalid, the node MUST send an\n\
    \   ICMP Locator Update message (containing the Nonce Option with the\n   appropriate\
    \ nonce value) to each of its correspondents [RFC6740]\n   [RFC6743].\n   In the\
    \ deployed Internet, packets sometimes arrive at a destination\n   out of order.\
    \  A receiving node MUST drop a packet arriving from a\n   correspondent if the\
    \ Source Locator of the received packet is not in\n   the receiving node's Identifier-Locator\
    \ Communication Cache's\n   (ILCC's) Set of Correspondent Locators UNLESS that\
    \ packet contains a\n   Nonce Option with the appropriate nonce value for that\
    \ Source\n   Identifier and Destination Identifier pair.  This is done to reduce\n\
    \   the risk of ILNP session hijacking or ILNP session interference\n   attacks.\n\
    \   Hence, the node that has had all previously valid Locators become\n   invalid\
    \ MUST include the Nonce Option with the appropriate nonce\n   value in all packets\
    \ (data or otherwise) to all correspondents for at\n   least three round-trip\
    \ times (RTTs) for each correspondent.  (N.B. An\n   implementation need not actually\
    \ calculate RTT values; it could just\n   use a fixed timer with a time long enough\
    \ to cover the longest RTT\n   path, such as 1 minute.)  This \"gratuitous authentication\"\
    \ ensures\n   that the correspondent can authenticate any received packet, even\
    \ if\n   the ICMP Locator Update control message arrives and is processed\n  \
    \ AFTER some other packet using the new Source Locator(s).  If an ILNP\n   session\
    \ is using IPsec, then, of course, IPsec SHOULD continue to be\n   used even if\
    \ one or more participating nodes change location.\n   Because IP Security for\
    \ ILNP [RFC6741] binds only to the Identifiers,\n   and not to the Locators in\
    \ the packet, changes in Locator value have\n   no impact on IP Security for ILNP\
    \ sessions.\n   As mobility and multihoming are functionally equivalent for ILNP,\n\
    \   this section applies equally to either situation and also to any\n   other\
    \ situation in which a node's set of Locators might change over\n   time.\n"

- title: 5.1.  ILNP Communication Cache
  contents:
  - "5.1.  ILNP Communication Cache\n   As described in [RFC6741], ILNP nodes maintain\
    \ an Identifier-Locator\n   Communication Cache (ILCC) that contains several variables\

    \   cache.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Mode Indicator
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Mode Indicator\n   To support ILNP, and to retain needed incremental deployability\
    \ and\n   backwards compatibility, the network layer needs a (logical) mode bit\n\
    \   in the Transport Control Block (or equivalent for one's\n   implementation)\
    \ to track which IP sessions are using traditional IPv6\n   and which IP sessions\
    \ are using ILNPv6.\n   If a given transport-layer session is using ILNP, then\
    \ an entry\n   corresponding to the network-layer components of that transport-layer\n\
    \   session also will exist in the ILNP Communication Cache.  Multiple\n   transport-layer\
    \ sessions between a given pair of nodes normally share\n   a single entry in\
    \ the ILNP Communication Cache, provided their\n   network-layer details (e.g.,\
    \ Identifiers, Nonces) are identical.\n   Because two different ILNP nodes at\
    \ two different locations might\n   share the same Identifier value, it is important\
    \ for an ILNP\n   implementation to use the ILNP Nonce values to distinguish between\n\
    \   different ILNP nodes that happen to be using the same (or some of the\n  \
    \ same) Identifier value(s).\n"
- title: 5.3.  IP Security
  contents:
  - "5.3.  IP Security\n   Whether or not ILNP is in use, the IPsec subsystem MUST\

    \ sent from the local node [RFC4301].  By combining the information\n   in the\
    \ IPsec SAD, of what IPsec Selectors apply, and the information\n   in the ILCC,\
    \ an implementation has sufficient knowledge to apply\n   IPsec properly to both\
    \ received and transmitted packets.\n"
- title: 6.  Backwards Compatibility
  contents:
  - "6.  Backwards Compatibility\n   This option MUST NOT be present in an IPv6 packet\
    \ unless the packet\n   is part of an ILNPv6 session.  As is explained below in\
    \ more detail,\n   the presence or absence of this option from the initial packets\
    \ of a\n   new IPv6 session is an important indication of whether the session\
    \ is\n   using classic IPv6 or ILNPv6.\n   ILNPv6 nodes MUST include this option\
    \ in the first few packets of\n   each ILNPv6 session, MUST include this option\
    \ in all ICMP messages\n   generated by endpoints participating in an ILNPv6 session,\
    \ and MAY\n   include this option in any and all packets of an ILNPv6 session.\
    \  It\n   is recommended that this option be included in all packets of the\n\
    \   ILNPv6 session if the packet loss for that session is known to be\n   much\
    \ higher than normal.\n   If a node supports ILNP and the node wishes to be able\
    \ to receive\n   incoming new ILNP sessions, then that node's FQDN SHOULD have\
    \ one or\n   more Node Identifier (NID) records and also one or more Locator\n\
    \   (e.g., L64 or LP) records associated with it in the DNS [RFC6742].\n   When\
    \ a host (\"initiator\") initiates a new IP session with a\n   correspondent (\"\
    responder\"), it normally will perform a DNS lookup to\n   determine the address(es)\
    \ of the responder.  A host that has been\n   enhanced to support the Identifier/Locator\
    \ Split operating mode\n   SHOULD look for Node Identifier (\"NID\") and Locator\
    \ (\"L64\") records\n   in any received DNS replies.  DNS servers that support\
    \ Identifier and\n   Locator (i.e., L64 or LP) records might include them (when\

    \ A\n   or AAAA records associated with a specified DNS FQDN.\n   If the initiator\
    \ supports ILNP, and from DNS data learns that the\n   responder also supports\

    \  Indeed, it is not expected that\n   this behaviour will need to be coded into\
    \ non-ILNP nodes, as this is\n   the normal behaviour for nodes receiving unknown\
    \ option headers.\n   If the initiator EITHER does not receive a response from\
    \ the\n   responder in a timely manner (e.g., within the applicable TCP timeout\n\
    \   for a TCP session), and does not receive an ICMP Unreachable error\n   message\
    \ for that packet, OR receives an ICMP Parameter Problem error\n   message for\
    \ that packet, then the initiator infers that the responder\n   is not able to\
    \ support ILNP.  In this case, the initiator should try\n   again to create the\
    \ new IP session, but this time use classic IPv6\n   and hence MUST NOT include\
    \ the ILNP Nonce Destination Option.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The ILNPv6 Nonce Destination Option is used ONLY\
    \ for ILNPv6 sessions,\n   because this option is part of the backwards compatibility\
    \ and\n   incremental-deployment approach for the Identifier-Locator Network\n\
    \   Protocol (ILNP).  This option MUST NOT be used with classic IPv6\n   sessions.\n\
    \   The ILNPv6 Nonce Destination Option only seeks to provide protection\n   against\
    \ off-path attacks on an IP session.  Ordinary IPv6 is\n   vulnerable to on-path\
    \ attacks unless IPsec is in use [CA-1995-01]\n   [RFC4301].  This option exists\
    \ to provide non-cryptographic\n   protection for ILNP sessions, protection equivalent\
    \ to the security\n   of IP sessions that do NOT use IPsec.\n   When ILNPv6 is\
    \ in use, the ILNP Nonce Destination Option MUST be\n   included in any ICMP control\
    \ messages (e.g., ICMP Unreachable, ICMP\n   Locator Update) sent by participants\
    \ in that ILNPv6 session, even if\n   IPsec also is in use for that ILNPv6 session.\
    \  Note that certain ICMP\n   messages, for example, a \"Packet Too Big\" message,\
    \ might be generated\n   by transit devices that are not aware of the ILNP Nonce\
    \ in use for\n   that ILNPv6 session; hence, they are not able to include the\
    \ ILNP\n   Nonce.  Again, this is also true of classic IPv6 in the same\n   operational\
    \ situations, so this does not create a new security issue.\n   For ILNPv6 sessions,\
    \ any ICMP control messages received from a\n   participant in that ILNPv6 session\
    \ that lack a Nonce Destination\n   Option MUST be discarded as forgeries.  This\
    \ security event SHOULD be\n   logged in accordance with local security logging\
    \ policies, including\n   details of the received packet (i.e., Source Locator,\
    \ Source\n   Identifier, Destination Locator, Destination Identifier, upper-layer\n\
    \   protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, OSPF) if any, transport-layer port numbers\n   if\
    \ any, and the date and time the packet was received).\n   For ILNPv6 sessions,\
    \ ICMP control messages received from a\n   participant in that ILNPv6 session\
    \ that have a Nonce Destination\n   Option, but do NOT have the correct nonce\
    \ value inside the Nonce\n   Destination Option, MUST be discarded as forgeries.\
    \  This security\n   event SHOULD be logged as described above.\n   Of course,\
    \ longer nonce values provide greater resistance to random\n   guessing of the\
    \ nonce value.  However, ILNPv6 sessions operating in\n   higher risk environments\
    \ SHOULD also use the cryptographic\n   authentication provided by IP Security\
    \ for ILNP [RFC6741] [RFC4301].\n   Use of IP Security for ILNP for an ILNPv6\
    \ session does not eliminate\n   the need for the ILNPv6 Nonce Option to be included\
    \ as described here\n   or as described in [RFC6743].\n   As a performance optimisation,\
    \ it is suggested that when both the\n   Nonce Option and IPsec are present in\
    \ a packet and the Nonce Option\n   has not been encrypted the Nonce Option value\
    \ be checked for validity\n   before beginning IPsec processing.  This minimises\
    \ the ability of an\n   off-path attacker to force the recipient to perform expensive\n\
    \   cryptographic computations on received control packets.\n   For environments\
    \ with data at differing Sensitivity Levels operating\n   over common infrastructure\
    \ (e.g., when the IPv6 CALIPSO is deployed),\n   it is recommended that the ILNP\
    \ Nonce Option be encrypted by using\n   ESP Transport-Mode or ESP Tunnel-Mode\
    \ in order to reduce the covert\n   channel bandwidth potential created by the\
    \ Nonce Option and to\n   prevent a node at one Sensitivity Level from attacking\
    \ an ILNP\n   session at a different Sensitivity Level [RFC5570].  Further, Multi-\n\
    \   Level Secure (MLS) systems SHOULD use different nonce values for ILNP\n  \
    \ sessions having different Sensitivity Levels [RFC5570].  Also, an MLS\n   implementation\
    \ of ILNP will also store the Sensitivity Label\n   information associated with\
    \ each ILNP session in the implementation's\n   ILCC.  When the Nonce Option and\
    \ the CALIPSO Option are present in\n   the same IPv6 Destination Options header,\
    \ the CALIPSO Option SHOULD\n   appear before the Nonce Option.\n   In all cases,\
    \ the ILNP Nonce Value MUST be unpredictable and\n   cryptographically random.\
    \  [RFC4086] provides concrete advice on how\n   to generate a suitable nonce\
    \ value.\n   As this is an option within the IPv6 Destination Options header,\n\
    \   rather than an option within the IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Option Header, the\n   presence\
    \ of this option in an IPv6 packet ought not disturb routers\n   along the path\
    \ an IP packet containing this option happens to travel.\n   Further, many deployed\
    \ modern IP routers (both IPv4 and IPv6) have\n   been explicitly configured to\
    \ ignore all IP Options, even including\n   the \"Router Alert\" option, when\
    \ forwarding packets not addressed to\n   the router itself.  Reports indicate\
    \ this has been done to preclude\n   use of IP Options as a (Distributed) Denial-of-Service\
    \ attack vector\n   on backbone routers.\n   As the Nonce is used in the checksum\
    \ of all Authentication Header\n   (AH) protected packets, as an implementation\
    \ hint, it would seem\n   sensible to include the Nonce value from the ILCC for\
    \ that ILNP\n   session.\n"

  - "8.  IANA Considerations\n   Consistent with the procedures of [RFC2780], IANA\
    \ has assigned a new\n   IPv6 Destination Option Type value of 0x8B.\n   The Nonce\
    \ Option MUST NOT change in transit and MUST be included in\n   IP Authentication\
    \ Header calculations.\n   Further, if an end system receives an IPv6 packet containing\
    \ this\n   option, but does not recognise this option, the end system MUST\n \
    \  discard the packet and, regardless of whether or not the received\n   packet's\
