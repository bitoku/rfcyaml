1.  Introduction A management system contains:  several (potentially many) nodes, each with a processing entity, termed an agent, which has access to management instrumentation; at least one management station; and, a management protocol, used to convey management information between the agents and management stations.
Operations of the protocol are carried out under an administrative framework which defines authentication, authorization, access control, and privacy policies.
Management stations execute management applications which monitor and control managed elements.
Managed elements are devices such as hosts, routers, terminal servers, etc., which are monitored and controlled via access to their management information.
Management information is viewed as a collection of managed objects, residing in a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base (MIB).
Collections of related objects are defined in MIB modules.
These modules are written using a subset of OSI's Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [1], termed the Structure of Management Information (SMI)
The management protocol, SNMPv2 [3], provides for the exchange of messages which convey management information between the agents and the management stations.
It is the purpose of this document to define managed objects which describe the behavior of a SNMPv2 entity.
For the purpose of exposition, the original Internet standard Network Management Framework, as described in RFCs 1155 (STD 16), 1157 (STD 15), and 1212 (STD 16), is termed the SNMP version 1 framework (SNMPv1).
The current framework is termed the SNMP version 2 framework (SNMPv2).

The initial revision of this MIB module was published as RFC 1450."
"A textual description of the entity.
This value should include the full name and version identification of the system's hardware type, software operating system, and networking software."
"The vendor's authoritative identification of the network management subsystem contained in the entity.
This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining `what kind of box' is being managed.
For example, if vendor `Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242, it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242.1.1 to its `Fred Router'."
"The time (in hundredths of a second) since the network management portion of the system was last re initialized."
MAX ACCESS  read write STATUS
The textual identification of the contact person for this managed node, together with information on how to contact this person.
If no contact information is known, the value is the zero length string."
MAX ACCESS  read write STATUS
An administratively assigned name for this managed node.
By convention, this is the node's fully qualified domain name.
If the name is unknown, the value is the zero length string."
MAX ACCESS  read write STATUS
The physical location of this node (e.g., `telephone closet, 3rd floor').
If the location is unknown, the value is the zero length string."
"A value which indicates the set of services that this entity may potentially offers.
The value is a sum.
This sum initially takes the value zero, Then, for each layer, L, in the range 1 through 7, that this node performs transactions for, 2 raised to (L 1) is added to the sum.
For example, a node which performs only routing functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3 1)).
In contrast, a node which is a host offering application services would have a value of 72 (2^(4 1)   2^(7 1)).
For systems including OSI protocols, layers 5 and 6 may also be counted."
MAX ACCESS not accessible STATUS
current DESCRIPTION "The (conceptual) table listing the capabilities of the local SNMPv2 entity acting in an agent role with respect to various MIB modules.
SNMPv2 entities having dynamically  configurable support of MIB modules will have a dynamically varying number of conceptual rows."
{ system 9 } sysOREntry OBJECT
MAX ACCESS not accessible STATUS
An entry (conceptual row) in the sysORTable."
MAX ACCESS not accessible STATUS
"A textual description of the capabilities identified by the corresponding instance of sysORID."
"The value of sysUpTime at the time this conceptual row was last instanciated."
"Indicates whether the SNMP entity is permitted to generate authenticationFailure traps.
The value of this object overrides any configuration information; as such, it provides a means whereby all authenticationFailure traps may be disabled.
Note that it is strongly recommended that this object be stored in non volatile memory so that it remains constant across re initializations of the network management system."
"The total number of GetRequest PDUs, GetNextRequest PDUs, GetBulkRequest PDUs, SetRequest PDUs, and InformRequest PDUs delivered to the SNMP entity which were silently dropped because the size of a reply containing an alternate Response PDU with an empty variable bindings field was greater than either a local constraint or the maximum message size associated with the originator of the request."
The authoritative identification of the notification currently being sent.
This variable occurs as the second varbind in every SNMPv2
Trap PDU and InformRequest PDU."
The authoritative identification of the enterprise associated with the trap currently being sent.
When a SNMPv2 proxy agent is mapping an RFC1157 Trap PDU into a SNMPv2 Trap PDU, this variable occurs as the last varbind."
{ snmpMIBObjects 5 } coldStart NOTIFICATION TYPE STATUS  current DESCRIPTION
"A coldStart trap signifies that the SNMPv2 entity, acting in an agent role, is reinitializing itself and that its configuration may have been altered."
A warmStart trap signifies that the SNMPv2 entity, acting in an agent role, is reinitializing itself such that its configuration is unaltered."
"An authenticationFailure trap signifies that the SNMPv2 entity, acting in an agent role, has received a protocol message that is not properly authenticated.
While all implementations of the SNMPv2 must be capable of generating this trap, the snmpEnableAuthenTraps object indicates whether this trap will be generated."
SNMPv2 entities, all acting in a manager role, to   coordinate their use of the SNMPv2 set operation.
An advisory lock used to allow several cooperating SNMPv2 entities, all acting in a manager role, to coordinate their use of the SNMPv2 set operation.
This object is used for coarse grain coordination.
To achieve fine grain coordination, one or more similar objects might be defined within each MIB group, as appropriate."

The total number valid SNMP PDUs which were delivered to the SNMP protocol entity and for which the value of the error status field is `readOnly'.
It should be noted that it is a protocol error to generate an SNMP PDU which contains the value `readOnly' in the error status field, as such this object is provided as a means of detecting incorrect implementations of the SNMP."
