  - "principal changes:\n     1)  The number of hosts the system can handle was increased\n\
    \         from three to four. Although this caused a rather large\n         internal\
    \ change to the IMP, the only external effects of\n         the change are the\
    \ presence of a new status light [light\n         8 monitors Host 4], and the\
    \ lengthening of the 10-second\n         and snapshot statistics.\n     2)  The\
    \ host handling routines were modified to gather more\n         accurate and voluminous\
    \ statistics on host usage of the\n         network, and report them to NCC.\n\
    \     3)  The 10-sec. statistics were changed to measure time for\n         the\
    \ host \"round trip\" statistic in units of 800 rather\n         than 100 microseconds.\n\
    \          It is not anticipated that the new system should have any\n     direct\
    \ effect on the hosts.\n          [ This RFC was put into machine readable form\
