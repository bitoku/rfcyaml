- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Although the use of the SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) Reason\n\
    \   header field in responses is considered in general in RFC 3326, its\n   use\
    \ is not specified for any particular response code.  Nonetheless,\n   existing\
    \ deployments have been using Reason header fields to carry\n   failure-related\
    \ Q.850 cause codes in SIP responses to INVITE requests\n   that have been gatewayed\
    \ to Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)\n   systems.  This document normatively\
    \ describes the use of the Reason\n   header field in carrying Q.850 cause codes\
    \ in SIP responses.\n"

    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\

- title: 3.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "3.  Applicability\n   This document allows SIP responses to carry Reason header\
    \ fields as\n   follows:\n      Any SIP Response message, with the exception of\
    \ a 100 (Trying),\n      MAY contain a Reason header field with a Q.850 [Q.850]\
    \ cause code.\n      The Reason header field is not needed in the 100 (Trying)\n\
    \      responses, since they are transmitted hop by hop, not end to end.\n   \
    \   SIP responses with Reason header fields carrying values other than\n     \
    \ Q.850 [Q.850] cause codes are outside of the scope of this\n      document.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This specification allows the presence of the\
    \ Reason header field\n   containing Q.850 [Q.850] cause codes in responses. \
    \ The presence of\n   the Reason header field in a response does not affect the\
    \ treatment\n   of the response.  Nevertheless, there could be situations where\
    \ a\n   wrong Q.850 [Q.850] cause code could, for example, cause an\n   announcement\
    \ system to play the wrong information.  To avoid such\n   situations, it is RECOMMENDED\
    \ that this header field be protected by\n   a suitable integrity mechanism. \
    \ The use of transport- or network-\n   layer hop-by-hop security mechanisms,\
    \ such as Transport Layer\n   Security (TLS) or IPsec with appropriate cipher\
    \ suites, can satisfy\n   this requirement.\n"
