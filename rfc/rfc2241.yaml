  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document defines three new DHCP options for delivering\n  \
    \ configuration information to clients of the Novell Directory\n   Services. The\
    \ first option carries a list of NDS servers. The second\n   option carries the\
    \ name of the client's NDS tree. The third carries\n   the initial NDS context.\
    \ These three options provide an NDS client\n   with enough information to connect\
    \ to an NDS tree without manual\n   configuration of the client.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Novell Directory Services is a distributed, replicated, hierarchical\n\
    \   database of objects representing network resources such as nodes,\n   services,\
    \ users, and applications. An NDS client must be able to\n   locate an NDS server\
    \ in order to authenticate itself to the network\n   and gain access to the database.\
    \ In addition, the node's user is\n   better served if the NDS client's attention\
    \ is focused on the area of\n   the NDS database likely to be of the most interest\
    \ to the user.  This\n   specification describes DHCP options [1] that carry NDS\
    \ information\n   to TCP/IP clients of NDS. The first option, the NDS Servers\
    \ Option,\n   carries a list of NDS servers. The other two options, the NDS Tree\n\
    \   Name Option and the NDS Context Option, provide the client with a\n   default\
    \ context within the NDS database.\n   The NDS Tree Name Option and the NDS Context\
    \ Option carry 16-bit\n   Unicode text encoded into an octet stream using UTF-8\
    \ [4]. A complete\n   DHCP implementation can represent of the entire Unicode\
    \ character set\n   supported by NDS. At the same time, 7-bit ASCII text is unchanged\
    \ by\n   the UTF-8 transformation. In environments where the NDS tree name and\n\
    \   context are restricted to the range of 7-bit ASCII characters, ASCII-\n  \
    \ only DHCP clients and servers can support these options by using the\n   ASCII\
    \ text as the UTF-8 encoded data.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"\
    REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    ,  \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119. [2]\n"
- title: 2. NDS Servers Option
  contents:
  - "2. NDS Servers Option\n   This option specifies one or more NDS servers for the\
    \ client to\n   contact for access to the NDS database. Servers SHOULD be listed\
    \ in\n   order of preference.\n   The code for this option is 85. The minimum\
    \ length of this option is\n   4 octets, and the length MUST be a multiple of\
    \ 4.\n      Code   Len        Address 1               Address 2\n     +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--\n\

    \  +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--\n"
- title: 3. NDS Tree Name Option
  contents:
  - "3. NDS Tree Name Option\n   This option specifies the name of the NDS tree the\
    \ client will be\n   contacting. NDS tree names are 16-bit Unicode strings. For\n\
    \   transmission in the NDS Tree Name Option, an NDS tree name is\n   transformed\
    \ into octets using UTF-8. The string should NOT be zero\n   terminated.\n   The\
    \ code for this option is 86. The maximum possible length for this\n   option\
    \ is 255 bytes.\n       Code Len  NDS Tree Name\n      +----+----+----+----+----+----+--\n\
    \      | 86 | n  | c1 | c2 | c3 | c4 |  ...\n      +----+----+----+----+----+----+--\n"
- title: 4. NDS Context Option
  contents:
  - "4. NDS Context Option\n   This option specifies the initial NDS context the client\
    \ should use.\n   NDS contexts are 16-bit Unicode strings. For transmission in\
    \ the NDS\n   Context Option, an NDS context is transformed into octets using\
    \ UTF-\n   8. The string should NOT be zero terminated.\n   A single DHCP option\
    \ can only contain 255 octets. Since an NDS\n   context name can be longer than\
    \ that, this option can appear more\n   than once in the DHCP packet. The contents\
    \ of all NDS Context options\n   in the packet should be concatenated as suggested\
    \ in the DHCP\n   specification [3, page 24] to get the complete NDS context.\
    \ A single\n   encoded character could be split between two NDS Context Options.\n\
    \   The code for this option is 87. The maximum length for each instance\n   of\
    \ this option is 255, but, as just described, the option may appear\n   more than\
    \ once if the desired NDS context takes up more than 255\n   octets. Implementations\
    \ are discouraged from enforcing any specific\n   maximum to the final concatenated\
    \ NDS context.\n       Code Len  Initial NDS Context\n      +----+----+----+----+----+----+--\n\
    \      | 87 | n  | c1 | c2 | c3 | c4 |  ...\n      +----+----+----+----+----+----+--\n"

  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   DHCP currently provides no authentication or security\
    \ mechanisms.\n   Potential exposures to attack are discussed in section 7 of\
    \ the DHCP\n   protocol specification [3]. In particular, these DHCP options allow\n\
    \   an unauthorized DHCP server to misdirect an NDS client to a\n   nonexistent\
    \ NDS server or even a spoof NDS server. These threats are\n   similar to what\
    \ NDS faces during normal operations in its native IPX\n   environment.\n"
