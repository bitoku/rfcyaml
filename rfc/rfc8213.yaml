  - "Abstract\n   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) has no\n\
    \   guidance for how to secure messages exchanged between servers and\n   relay\
    \ agents.  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6\n   (DHCPv6) states\
    \ that IPsec should be used to secure messages\n   exchanged between servers and\
    \ relay agents but does not require\n   encryption.  With recent concerns about\
    \ pervasive monitoring and\n   other attacks, it is appropriate to require securing\
    \ relay-to-relay\n   and relay-to-server communication for DHCPv6 and relay-to-server\n\
    \   communication for DHCPv4.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4)\
    \ [RFC2131]\n   and the Bootstrap Protocol [RFC1542] have no guidance for how\
    \ to\n   secure messages exchanged between servers and relay agents.  The\n  \
    \ Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) [RFC3315]\n   states that\
    \ IPsec should be used to secure messages exchanged between\n   servers and relay\
    \ agents but does not recommend encryption.  With\n   recent concerns about pervasive\
    \ monitoring [RFC7258], it is\n   appropriate to require use of IPsec with encryption\
    \ for relay-to-\n   server communication for DHCPv4 and require use of IPsec with\n\
    \   encryption for relay-to-relay and relay-to-server communication for\n   DHCPv6.\n\
    \   This document specifies the optional requirements for relay agent and\n  \
    \ server implementations to support IPsec authentication and encryption\n   and\
    \ recommends that operators enable this IPsec support.\n"

  - "3.  Security of Messages Exchanged between Servers and Relay Agents\n   For DHCPv6\
    \ [RFC3315], this specification REQUIRES relay and server\n   implementations\
    \ to support IPsec encryption of relay-to-relay and\n   relay-to-server communication\
    \ as documented below.  The remainder of\n   this section replaces the text in\
    \ Section 21.1 of [RFC3315] when this\n   specification is followed.\n   For DHCPv4\
    \ [RFC2131], this specification REQUIRES relay and server\n   implementations\
    \ to support IPsec encryption of relay-to-server\n   communication as documented\
    \ below.\n   This specification RECOMMENDS that operators enable IPsec for this\n\
    \   communication.\n   By using IPsec with encryption for this communication,\
    \ potentially\n   sensitive client message and relay included information, such\
    \ as the\n   DHCPv4 Relay Agent Information option (82) [RFC3046], vendor-specific\n\
    \   information (for example, the options defined in [CableLabs-DHCP]),\n   and\
    \ Access-Network-Identifier option(s) [RFC7839], are protected from\n   pervasive\
    \ monitoring and other attacks.\n   Relay agents and servers MUST be able to exchange\
    \ messages using the\n   IPsec mechanisms described in [RFC4301] with the conditions\
    \ below.\n   If a client message is relayed through multiple relay agents (relay\n\
    \   chain), each of the relay agents MUST have established independent,\n   pairwise\
    \ trust relationships.  That is, if messages from client C\n   will be relayed\
    \ by relay agent A to relay agent B and then to the\n   server, relay agents A\
    \ and B MUST be configured to use IPsec for the\n   messages they exchange, and\
    \ relay agent B and the server MUST be\n   configured to use IPsec for the messages\
    \ they exchange.\n   Relay agents and servers use IPsec with the following conditions:\n\
    \   Selectors        Relay agents are manually configured with the\n         \
    \           addresses of the relay agent or server to which DHCP\n           \
    \         messages are to be forwarded.  Each relay agent and\n              \
    \      server that will be using IPsec for securing DHCP\n                   \
    \ messages MUST also be configured with a list of the\n                    relay\
    \ agents to which messages will be returned.\n                    The selectors\
    \ for the relay agents and servers will\n                    be the pairs of addresses\
    \ defining relay agents and\n                    servers and the direction of\
    \ DHCP message exchange\n                    on DHCPv4 UDP port 67 or DHCPv6 UDP\
    \ port 547.\n   Mode             Relay agents and servers MUST use IPsec in transport\n\
    \                    mode and use Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).\n   Encryption\
    \ and authentication algorithms\n                    This document REQUIRES combined\
    \ mode algorithms for\n                    ESP authenticated encryption, ESP encryption\n\
    \                    algorithms, and ESP authentication algorithms as per\n  \
    \                  Sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 of [RFC7321],\n                \
    \    respectively.  Encryption is required as relay\n                    agents\
    \ may forward unencrypted client messages as\n                    well as include\
    \ additional sensitive information,\n                    such as vendor-specific\
    \ information (for example,\n                    the options defined in [CableLabs-DHCP])\
    \ and the\n                    Access-Network-Identifier Option defined in\n \
    \                   [RFC7839].\n   Key management   Because both relay agents\
    \ and servers tend to be\n                    managed by a single organizational\
    \ entity, public\n                    key schemes MAY be optional.  Manually configured\n\
    \                    key management MAY suffice but does not provide\n       \
    \             defense against replayed messages.  Accordingly,\n             \
    \       Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)\n                   \
    \ [RFC7296] with pre-shared secrets SHOULD be\n                    supported.\
    \  IKEv2 with public keys MAY be supported.\n                    Additional information\
    \ on manual vs. automated key\n                    management and when one should\
    \ be used over the\n                    other can be found in [RFC4107].\n   Security\
    \ policy  DHCP messages between relay agents and servers MUST\n              \
    \      only be accepted from DHCP peers as identified in\n                   \
    \ the local configuration.\n   Authentication   Shared keys, indexed to the source\
    \ IP address of the\n                    received DHCP message, are adequate in\
    \ this\n                    application.\n   Note: As using IPsec with multicast\
    \ has additional complexities (see\n   [RFC5374]), relay agents SHOULD be configured\
    \ to forward DHCP\n   messages to unicast addresses.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The security model specified in this document\
    \ is hop by hop.  For\n   DHCPv6, there could be multiple relay agents between\
    \ a client and\n   server, and each of these hops needs to be secured.  For DHCPv4,\n\
    \   there is no support for multiple relays.\n   As this document only mandates\
    \ securing messages exchanged between\n   relay agents and servers, the message\
    \ exchanges between clients and\n   the first-hop relay agent or server are not\
    \ secured.  Clients may\n   follow the recommendations in [RFC7844] to minimize\
    \ what information\n   they expose or make use of secure DHCPv6 [SEC-DHCPv6] to\
    \ secure\n   communication between the client and server.\n   As mentioned in\
    \ Section 14 of [RFC4552], the following are known\n   limitations of the usage\
    \ of manual keys:\n   o  As the sequence numbers cannot be negotiated, replay\
    \ protection\n      cannot be provided.  This leaves DHCP insecure against all\
    \ the\n      attacks that can be performed by replaying DHCP packets.\n   o  Manual\
    \ keys are usually long lived (changing them often is a\n      tedious task).\
    \  This gives an attacker enough time to discover the\n      keys.\n   It should\
    \ be noted that if the requirements in this document are\n   followed, while the\
    \ DHCP traffic on the wire between relays and\n   servers is encrypted, the unencrypted\
    \ data may still be available\n   through other attacks on the DHCP servers, relays,\
    \ and related\n   systems.  Securing these systems and the data in databases and\
    \ logs\n   also needs to be considered on both the systems themselves and when\n\
    \   transferred over a network (i.e., to network attached storage for\n   backups\
    \ or to operational support systems).\n   Use of IPsec as described herein is\
    \ also applicable to Lightweight\n   DHCPv6 Relay Agents [RFC6221], as they have\
    \ a link-local address that\n   can be used to secure communication with their\
    \ next-hop relay(s).\n"
