This Network Working Group Request for Comments documents the currently assigned values from several series of numbers used in network protocol implementations.
This RFC will be updated periodically, and in any case current information can be obtained from Joyce Reynolds.
The assignment of numbers is also handled by Joyce.
If you are developing a protocol or application that will require the use of a link, socket, port, protocol, network number, etc., please contact Joyce to receive a number assignment.

Most of the protocols mentioned here are documented in the RFC series of notes.
The more prominent and more generally used are documented in the "Internet Protocol Transition Workbook" [39] or in the old "ARPANET Protocol Handbook" [40] prepared by the NIC.
Some of the items listed are undocumented.
Further information on protocols can be found in the memo "Official ARPA Internet Protocols" [104].
In all cases the name and mailbox of the responsible individual is indicated.
In the lists that follow, a bracketed entry, e.g., [nn,iii], at the right hand margin of the page indicates a reference for the listed protocol, where the number ("nn") cites the document and the letters ("iii") cites the person.
Whenever possible, the letters are a NIC Ident as used in the WHOIS service.
RFC 960 Network Numbers ASSIGNED NETWORK NUMBERS
The network numbers listed here are used as internet addresses by the Internet Protocol (IP)
The IP uses a 32 bit address field and divides that address into a network part and a "rest" or local address part.
The division takes 3 forms or classes.
The first type of address, or class A, has a 7 bit network number and a 24 bit local address.
The highest order bit is set to 0.
This allows 128 class A networks.
The second type of address, class B, has a 14 bit network number and a 16 bit local address.
The two highest order bits are set to 1 0.
This allows 16,384 class B networks.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
The third type of address, class C, has a 21 bit network number and a 8 bit local address.
The three highest order bits are set to 1 1 0.
This allows 2,097,152 class C networks.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
No addresses are allowed with the three highest order bits set to 1 1 1.
These addresses (sometimes called "class D") are reserved.
This is called the "dotted decimal" notation.
For example, the internet address of USC ISIB.ARPA in dotted decimal is 010.003.000.052, or 10.3.0.52.
The dotted decimal notation will be used in the listing of assigned network numbers.
A networks will have nnn.rrr.rrr.rrr, the class B networks will have nnn.nnn.rrr.rrr, and the class C networks will have nnn.nnn.nnn.rrr, where nnn represents part or all of a network number and rrr represents part or all of a local address.
There are four catagories of users of Internet Addresses: Research, Defense, Government (Non Defense), and Commercial.
To reflect the allocation of network identifiers among the categories, a one character code is placed to the left of the network number: R for Research, D for Defense, G for Government, and C for Commercial (see Appendix A for further details on this division of the network identification).
Network numbers are assigned for networks that are connected to the ARPA Internet and DDN Internet, and for independent networks that use the IP family protocols (these are usually commercial).
These independent networks are marked with an asterisk preceding the number.
The administrators of independent networks must apply separately for permission to interconnect their network with either the ARPA Internet of the DDN Internet.
Independent networks should not be listed in the working tables of either the ARPA Internet or DDN Internet hosts or gateways.
For various reasons, the assigned numbers of networks are sometimes changed.
To ease the transition the old number will be listed for a transition period as well.
These "old number" entries will be marked with a "T" following the number and preceding the name, and the network name will be suffixed " TEMP".
: In certain contexts, it is useful to have fixed addresses with functional significance rather than as identifiers of specific hosts.
When such usage is called for, the address zero is to be interpreted as meaning "this", as in "this network".
The address of all ones are to be interpreted as meaning "all", as in "all hosts".
Or, the address 0.0.0.37 could be interpreted as meaning host 37 on this network.

RFC 960 Version Numbers ASSIGNED VERSION NUMBERS
In the Internet Protocol (IP) [39,92] there is a field to identify the version of the internetwork general protocol.
This field is 4 bits in size.
RFC 960 Protocol Numbers ASSIGNED PROTOCOL NUMBERS
In the Internet Protocol (IP)
[39,92] there is a field, called Protocol, to identify the the next level protocol.
This is an 8 bit field.
RFC 960 Port Numbers ASSIGNED
PORT NUMBERS Ports are used in the TCP [39,93] to name the ends of logical connections which carry long term conversations.
For the purpose of providing services to unknown callers, a service contact port is defined.
This list specifies the port used by the server process as its contact port.
The contact port is sometimes called the "well known port".
To the extent possible, these same port assignments are used with the UDP [39,91].
To the extent possible, these same port assignments are used with the ISO TP4 [57].
The assigned ports use a small portion of the possible port numbers.
The assigned ports have all except the low order eight bits cleared to zero.
The low order eight bits are specified here.

SWIFT RVF  Swift Remote Vitural File Protocol
Locus PC Interface Net Map Server
The Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) [108,105] specifies that groups of gateways may form autonomous systems.
The EGP provides a 16 bit field for identifying such systems.
The values of this field are registered here.
The Internet Domain Naming System (DOMAIN) includes several parameters.
These are documented in RFC 883 [72].
The CLASS parameter is listed here.
The per CLASS parameters are defined in separate RFCs as indicated.
Logical Addresses ASSIGNED ARPANET LOGICAL ADDRESSES
The ARPANET facility for "logical addressing" is described in RFC 878 [65].
A portion of the possible logical addresses are reserved for standard uses.
There are 49,152 possible logical host addresses.
Of these, 256 are reserved for assignment to well known functions.
Assignments for well known functions are made by Joyce Reynolds.
Assignments for other logical host addresses are made by the NIC.
The word "link" here refers to a field in the original ARPANET Host/IMP interface leader.
The link was originally defined as an 8 bit field.
Later specifications defined this field as the "message id" with a length of 12 bits.
The name link now refers to the high order 8 bits of this 12 bit message id field.
The Host/IMP interface is defined in BBN Report 1822 [10].
The low order 4 bits of the message id field are called the sub link.
Unless explicitly specified otherwise for a particular protocol, there is no sender to receiver significance to the sub link.
The sender may use the sub link in any way he chooses (it is returned in the RFNM by the destination IMP), the receiver should ignore the sub link.
Some of the networks of all classes are IEEE 802 Networks.
These systems may use a Service Access Point field in much the same way the ARPANET uses the "link" field.
For further information and SAP number assignments, please contact: Mr. Maris Graube, Chairman, IEEE 802, Route 1, 244 H, Forest Grove, Oregon, 97116.
The IEEE 802.3 header does not have a type field to indicate what protocol is used at the next level.
As a work around for this problem, one can put the Ethernet type field value in the IEEE 802.3 header's length field and use the following test to determine the appropriate processing on receipt.
If the value in the length field of the IEEE 802.3 header is greater than the Ethernet maximum packet length, then interpret the value as an Ethernet type field.
Otherwise, interpret the packet as an IEEE 802.3 packet.
The proposed standard for transmission of IP datagrams over IEEE 802.3 networks is specified in RFC 948 [127].
RFC 960 Ethernet Numbers ETHERNET NUMBERS OF INTEREST
Many of the networks of all classes are Ethernets (10Mb) or Experimental Ethernets (3Mb).
These systems use a message "type" field in much the same way the ARPANET uses the "link" field.
If you need an Ethernet number, contact the XEROX Corporation, Office Products Division, Network Systems Administration Office, 333 Coyote Hill Road, Palo Alto, California, 94304.
[HGM] The standard for transmission of IP datagrams over Ethernets and Experimental Ethernets is specified in RFC 894 [54] and RFC 895 [76] respectively.
The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) specified in RFC 826 [75] has several parameters.
The assigned values for these parameters are listed here.
[GXP] Protocol Type (pro) Use the same codes as listed in the section called "Ethernet Numbers of Interest" (all hardware types use this code set for the protocol type).
RFC 960 Public Data Network Numbers ASSIGNED PUBLIC DATA NETWORK NUMBERS
One of the Internet Class A Networks is the international system of Public Data Networks.
This section lists the mapping between the Internet Addresses and the Public Data Network Addresses (X.121).
213 00045 00   RAND TN
The standard for transmission of IP datagrams over the Public Data Network is specified in RFC 877 [60].
RFC 960 Telnet Options ASSIGNED TELNET OPTIONS
The Telnet Protocol has a number of options that may be negotiated.
These options are listed here.
"Official ARPA Internet Protocols" [104] provides more detailed information.
These are the Official Machine Names as they appear in the NIC Host Table.
Their use is described in RFC 810 [41].

The network numbers in class A, B, and C network addresses are allocated among Research, Defense, Government (Non Defense) and Commercial uses.
Class A (highest order bit 0)
12286 Reserved Addresses: (0, 16383)
1572862 Reserved Addresses: (0, 2097151)
All addresses in this class are reserved for future use.
Within the Research community, network identifiers will only be granted to applicants who show evidence that they are acquiring standard Bolt Beranek and Newman gateway software or have implemented or are acquiring a gateway meeting the Exterior Gateway Protocol requirements.
Acquisition of the Berkeley BSD
4.2 UNIX software might be considered evidence of the latter.
Rather, the identifiers could be moved from Research to Defense, Government or Commercial status.
Thus, network identifiers may change state among Research, Defense, Government and Commercial, but the number of identifiers allocated to each use must remain within the limits indicated above.
To make possible this fluid assignment, the network identifier spaces are not allocated by simple partition, but rather by specific assignment.
These assignments are shared by the four communities.
These assignments are shared by the four communities.
These assignments are shared by the four communities.
These assignments are shared by the four communities.
TCP, IP and Telnet Option Identifiers
These assignments are shared by the four communities.
Joyce Reynolds is the coordinator for all number assignments.
