  - "1 Introduction\n   Wireless technology, including wireless LANs, data transfer\
    \ over\n   cellular radio (GSM, 3GPP, etc), and mobile operations from aircraft\n\
    \   and near earth spacecraft are becoming increasingly important.  Some\n   market\
    \ projections suggest that a mobile Internet in parallel with or\n   augmenting\
    \ the wired Internet may be comparable in size to the wired\n   Internet as early\
    \ as 2003.\n   The wireless operators have not, however, chosen to use IPv4, TCP,\n\
    \   full HTTP/HTML, and other applications for a variety of reasons.\n   These\
    \ relate to edge device cost, bandwidth limitations, perceived\n   protocol imperfections,\
    \ unnecessary complexities, the chattiness of\n   the application protocols, and\
    \ network layer addressing issues.\n   Unfortunately, this creates some serious\
    \ issues at the wired/wireless\n   demarcation: end to end operation is sacrificed,\
    \ security is\n   compromised, and automated content modification in some form\
    \ becomes\n   necessary.  The IAB considers these to be serious fundamental issues,\n\
    \   which will in time be a serious impediment to the usability of the\n   combined\
    \ Internet if not addressed.\n   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB), on February\
    \ 29 thru March 2,\n   2000, held an invitational workshop on wireless internetworking.\
    \  The\n   goal of the workshop was to assess current and future uses of\n   Internet\
    \ technology in wireless environments, to make recommendations\n   on research\
    \ and standardization tasks to improve acceptance of\n   Internet network and\
    \ transport protocols in wireless environments,\n   and to evaluate methods to\
    \ improve communication and collaboration\n   among Internet standards working\
    \ groups and those of the telephony\n   and wireless sectors.\n   The following\
    \ topics were defined for discussion:\n        + Local area wireless technologies\n\
    \        + Cellular wireless technologies\n        + Wireless Application Protocol\
    \ (WAP)\n        + Near-space and aviation wireless applications\n        + Voice\
    \ over IP (VoIP) over wireless networks\n        + Security over wireless networks\n\
    \        + Transport and QoS over wireless networks\n        + Use of WWW protocols\
    \ over wireless and small screen devices\n        + Addressing requirements for\
    \ wireless devices\n        + Compression and bit error requirements for wireless\
    \ networks\n   The fundamental question addressed in these discussion is \"what\
    \ are\n   the issues, and what really needs to be done to unify the Internet\n\
    \   below the application layer.\"  Applications will also need to be\n   addressed,\
    \ but were perceived to be more than could be usefully\n   discussed in a three-day\
    \ workshop, and probably require different\n   expertise.\n   Section 2 presents\
    \ a concise overview of the individual presentations\n   made during the workshop.\
    \  References to more extensive materials are\n   provided.  Details on major\
    \ discussion topics are provided in section\n   3.  Section 4 presents the recommendations\
    \ made to wireless\n   operators, IRTF, and IETF on the architectural roadmap\
    \ for the next\n   few years.  It should be noted that not all participants agreed\
    \ with\n   all of the statements, and it was not clear whether anyone agreed\n\
    \   with all of them.  However, the recommendations made are based on\n   strong\
    \ consensus among the participants.  Finally, section 5\n   highlights references\
    \ to security considerations discussed, appendix\n   A lists contact information\
    \ of workshop participants, and appendix B\n   lists the author contact information.\n"

- title: 3.1 Discussion on "Walled Garden" Service Model
  contents:
  - "3.1 Discussion on \"Walled Garden\" Service Model\n   Presentations from members\
    \ involved in the cellular wireless (3GPP,\n   3G.IP, MWIF) and WAP environments\
    \ quickly illustrated a significant\n   difference in protocol specification and\
    \ service models from that\n   typically assumed by the Internet community.  These\
    \ communities focus\n   on defining a profile (set of protocols and operational\
    \ parameters)\n   that combine to provide a well defined user service.  In addition,\n\
    \   the carriers typically prefer to have complete (or as much as\n   possible)\
    \ control over the entire service, including user access\n   device, transmission\
    \ facilities, and service \"content\".  This style\n   of service model appears\
    \ to have been inherited from the classic\n   telephony provider model.  The term\
    \ \"walled garden\" was coined to\n   describe the resulting captive customer\
    \ economic and service model.\n   That is, the user is constrained within the\
    \ limits of the service\n   provided by the carrier with limited ability to extend\
    \ features or\n   access services outside the provider.           The \"walled\
    \ garden\"\n   service model is in stark contrast to the \"open\" service assumed\
    \ in\n   the Internet.  The application, access device, and service content\n\
    \   may each be controlled by a different entity, and the service\n   provider\
    \ is typically viewed as little more than a \"bit pipe\".\n   Additionally, specification\
    \ typically define a standalone protocol or\n   application rather than the set\
    \ of features and interoperation with\n   other components required to deploy\
    \ a commercial service.\n   Some discussion focused on whether cellular carriers\
    \ could be\n   persuaded to transition toward the Internet \"open\" service model.\n\
    \   Responses indicated that there was little hope of this as carriers\n   will\
    \ always fight being reduced to a \"bit pipe\", fearing they cannot\n   sustain\
    \ sufficient revenues without the value added services.  An\n   additional point\
    \ raised was that the closed model of the \"walled\n   garden\" simplifies a number\
    \ of issues, such as security,\n   authorization, and billing when the entire\
    \ network is considered\n   secured and controlled under a single administration.\
    \  These\n   simplification can eliminate roadblocks to service deployment before\n\
    \   scalable, interdomain solutions are available.\n   Even though there seems\
    \ little hope of evolving carriers away from\n   the \"walled garden\" service\
    \ in the short term, there was significant\n   value in recognizing its presence.\
    \  This led to observations that\n   \"walled garden\" Internet-based services\
    \ will operate somewhat like\n   current intranet services.  Also, mechanisms\
    \ should be investigated\n   to simplify interoperation and controlled access\
    \ to the Internet.\n   Finally, the difference between Internet protocol specification\n\
    \   contrasted to service profiles highlights some of the confusion those\n  \
    \ in the telephony environment encounter when attempting to incorporate\n   Internet\
    \ capabilities.\n   Much of the current work in extending Internet-based services\
    \ to\n   cellular customers has focused on data services such as email or web\n\
    \   access.  One observation on the reluctance of carriers to release any\n  \
    \ control over services was that this may be an impediment to adoption\n   of\
    \ Internet-based voice services.  Current work on voice over IP\n   (VoIP) and\
    \ call signaling (SIP [30]) loosens control over these\n   services, much of the\
    \ functionality is moved into the SIP agent with\n   the carrier being reduced\
    \ to an access provider (i.e., \"bit pipe\").\n"
- title: 3.2 Discussion on Mobility and Roaming
  contents:
  - "3.2 Discussion on Mobility and Roaming\n   An inherent characteristic of wireless\
    \ systems is their potential for\n   accommodating device roaming and mobility.\
    \  Some discussion focused\n   on the model of mobility presented to the user.\

    \ some actions\n   at one location, then shuts down and moves, followed by restart\
    \ at a\n   new location.\n   3G.IP uses the term \"macro mobility\" to describe\

    \ discussion.  Cellular\n   operators have already deployed protocols providing\
    \ significant\n   support for roaming.  This has led several efforts, such as\
    \ 3GPP and\n   3G.IP, toward architecture relying on telephone system for all\n\
    \   mobility support, hiding roaming from the IP layer.\n   Arguments for cellular-based\
    \ roaming centered on concerns about the\n   mobile IP model.  There was concern\
    \ that home agent and foreign agent\n   involvement in delivery might introduce\
    \ bottleneck, and the\n   perception that mobile IP handoff is too slow.  A rebuttal\
    \ offered\n   was that IETF mobileip working group is introducing hierarchy and\n\
    \   route optimization to improve performance and robustness [50], and\n   there\
    \ was disagreement on the point regarding slow handoff under\n   mobile IP.\n\
    \   Detriments to the cellular-based roaming include the lack of IP\n   support\
    \ out to the mobile device and the added tunneling protocols\n   and overhead\
    \ required.  Additionally, roaming is less well defined\n   when traversing service\

    \   Fixing identification with the device may simplify manufacture and\n   provide\

    \   TCP makes assumptions on loss as congestion indication.  The\n   statement\
    \ was made that TCP was designed for links with about 1%\n   corruption loss,\
    \ and provided that constraint is met then TCP should\n   function properly. \
    \ Presentation on IS-95 CDMA-based data service\n   showed that it conditions\
    \ line to provide 1--2% error rate with\n   little correlation between loss. \
    \ Similar conditioning and Forward\n   Error Correction (FEC) mechanisms may be\
    \ appropriate for other\n   wireless and satellite systems [4].  This may not\
    \ be true for all\n   wireless media, but it was interesting in the fact that\
    \ it indicates\n   TCP should work properly on many wireless media.  However,\
    \ the amount\n   of discussion and suggestions on TCP performance optimizations\
    \ showed\n   that there can be a considerable gap between merely working and\n\
    \   working well.\n   One issue raised several times was related to the effects\
    \ of non-\n   congestive loss on TCP performance.  In the wireless environment\n\
    \   non-congestive loss may be more prevalent due to corruption loss\n   (especially\
    \ if the wireless link cannot be conditioned to properly\n   control error rate)\
    \ or an effect of mobility (e.g., temporary outage\n   while roaming through an\
    \ area of poor coverage).  These losses can\n   have great detrimental effect\
    \ on TCP performance, reducing the\n   transmission window and halving the congestion\
    \ window size.  Much of\n   the discussion focused on proposing mechanisms to\
    \ explicitly indicate\n   a non-congestive loss to the TCP source.  Suggestions\
    \ included a\n   Non-Congestive Loss Indication (NCLI) sent for instance when\
    \ packet\n   corruption loss is detected, or sending a Source Encourage (SE) to\n\
    \   stimulate source transmission at the end of an outage.  In addition\n   to\
    \ data corruption, wireless links can also experience dropouts.  In\n   this situation\
    \ any active TCP sessions will commence periodic\n   retransmissions, using an\
    \ exponentially increasing back-off timer\n   between each attempt.  When the\
    \ link becomes available it may be many\n   seconds before the TCP sessions resume\
    \ transmission.  Mechanisms to\n   alleviate this problem, including packet caching\
    \ and triggered\n   retransmission were discussed.  The more generic form of all\
    \ of these\n   mechanisms is one that allows the state of the layer two (datalink)\n\
    \   system to signal to the TCP session its current operating mode.\n   Developing\
    \ a robust form of such a signaling mechanism, and\n   integrating these signals\
    \ into the end-to-end TCP control loop may\n   present opportunities to improve\
    \ TCP transport efficiency for\n   wireless environments.\n   TCP improvements\
    \ have been incorporated to support \"long\" links\n   (i.e., those with large\
    \ delay and bandwidth characteristics) [36],\n   however considerable expertise\
    \ may still be required to tune socket\n   buffers for maximum performance.  Some\
    \ work has been done on auto-\n   tuning buffers, which shows promise [58].  An\
    \ additional problem with\n   large windows and auto-tuning is the added header\
    \ overheads.  This\n   may exasperate the problems of running TCP over low bandwidth\
    \ links.\n   Suggestions included to explore dynamic negotiation of large window\n\
    \   extensions in the middle of a connection to alleviate these issues.\n   A\
    \ final issue raised with regardport (see discussion below in section\n   3.4.3).\n\
    \   There was also concern regarding mobility effects on TCP performance.\n  \
    \ TCP has implicit assumptions on bounding propagation delay.  If delay\n   exceeds\
    \ the smoothed round trip time plus four times the round trip\n   variance then\
    \ the segment is considered lost, triggering the normal\n   backoff procedures.\
    \  Could these assumptions be violated by segment\n   loss or duplication during\
    \ handoff? Work on D-SACK [25] may alleviate\n   these worries, detecting reordering\
    \ and allowing for adaptive DUP-ACK\n   threshold.  Finally, there was suggestion\
    \ it might be appropriate to\n   adapt (i.e., trigger slow start) immediately\
    \ after mobile handoff on\n   the assumption that path characteristics may differ.\n"

  - "3.7 Discussion on Header Compression\n   A critical deterrent to Internet protocol\
    \ adoption in the highly\n   band-width constrained wireless cellular environment\
    \ is the bit\n   overhead of the protocol encoding.  Examples presented highlighted\n\
    \   how a voice application (layered over IP [52,19], UDP [51], and RTP\n   [57])\
    \ requires a minimum of 40 bytes of headers for IPv4 or 60 bytes\n   for IPv6\
    \ before any application payload (e.g., 24 byte voice sample).\n   This overhead\
    \ was also presented as a contributing factor for the\n   creation of WAP Wireless\
    \ Datagram Protocol (WDP) rather than IP for\n   very low datarate bearers.\n\
    \   Discussion on header compression techniques to alleviate these\n   concerns\
    \ focused on work being performed within the IETF Robust\n   Header Compression\
    \ (rohc) working group.  This working group has\n   established goals for wireless\
    \ environment, to conserve radio\n   spectrum, to accommodate mobility, and to\
    \ be robust to packet loss\n   both before the point where compression is applied\
    \ and between\n   compressor and decompressor.  Additional requirements established\n\
    \   were that the technique be transparent, does not introduce additional\n  \
    \ errors, and that it is compatible with common protocol layerings\n   (e.g.,\
    \ IPv4, IPv6, RTP/UDP/IP, TCP/IP).\n   The primary observation was that this problem\
    \ is now largely solved!\n   The working group is currently evaluating the ROCCO\
    \ [38] and ACE [42]\n   protocols, and expects to finalize its recommendations\
    \ in the near\n   future.  It was reported that these encodings have a minimum\
    \ header\n   of 1 byte and result in average overhead of less than 2 bytes for\
    \ an\n   RTP/UDP/IP packet.  There is some extra overhead required if\n   transport\
    \ checksum is required and some issues still to be analyzed\n   related to interoperation\
    \ with encryption and tunneling.\n   A detriment to IPv6 adoption often cited\
    \ is its additional header\n   overhead, primarily attributed to its larger address\
    \ size.  A\n   secondary observation made was that it's believed that IPv6\n \
    \  accommodates greater header compression than IPv4.  This was\n   attributed\
    \ to the elimination of the checksum and identification\n   fields from the header.\n\
    \   Discussion on use of WWW protocols over wireless highlighted protocol\n  \
    \ encodings as another potential detriment to their adoption.  A number\n   of\
    \ alternatives were mentioned for investigation, including use of a\n   \"deflate\"\

    \ that optimizing protocol\n   encoding for bit savings often leads to shortcomings\
    \ or limitations\n   on protocol evolution.  However, it was also argued that\
    \ environments\n   where physical limitations have an effect on transmission capacity\n\
    \   and system performance may present exceptions where optimized\n   encodings\
    \ are beneficial.  Cellular wireless and near-space satellite\n   may fall into\
    \ this category.\n   The WAP protocols exhibit several examples where existing\
    \ Internet\n   protocols were felt to be too inefficient for adoption with very\
    \ low\n   datarate bearer services and limited capability devices.  The WAP\n\
    \   Wireless Session Protocol (WSP) is based on HTTPv1.1 [23], however\n   WSP\
    \ incorporates several changes to address perceived inefficiencies.\n   WSP uses\
    \ a more compact binary header encoding and optimizations for\n   efficient connection\

    \ Internet, and over 600\n   million wireless data (\"web handset\") users by\
    \ the year 2004.  Right\n   up front there was caution about these projections,\
    \ especially the\n   wireless data since it is highly speculative with little\
    \ history.\n   Secondly, there was some doubt regarding potential for significant\n\
    \   revenues from user base over 1 billion subscribers; this may be\n   pushing\
    \ the limits of world population with sufficient disposable\n   income to afford\

    \ nearly all the presentations on 3G cellular network technologies\n   discussion\
    \ on scaling to support the projected large number of\n   wireless data users\
    \ resulted in strong advocacy by the Internet\n   representatives for adoption\
    \ of IPv6 protocols.  There were some\n   positive signs that groups have begun\
    \ investigation into IPv6.  For\n   example, 3GPP has already defined IPv6 as\
    \ an option in their 1998 and\n   1999 specifications (release R98 and R99), and\
    \ are considering\n   specifying IPv6 as mandatory in the release 2000.  The MWIF\
    \ effort is\n   also cognizant of IPv4 and IPv6 issues and is currently wrestling\n\
    \   with their recommendations in this area.\n   Although there was limited positive\
    \ signs on IPv6 awareness,\n   indication is that there are long fights ahead\
    \ to gain consensus for\n   IPv6 adoption in any of the 3G standards efforts.\
    \  There was\n   considerable feedback that the telephony carriers perceive IPv6\
    \ as\n   more difficult to deploy, results in higher infrastructure equipment\n\
    \   expenses, and adds difficulty in interoperation and gatewaying to the\n  \
    \ current (IPv4) Internet.  Arguments for sticking with IPv4 primarily\n   came\
    \ down to the abundance and lower pricing of IPv4-based products,\n   and secondary\
    \ argument of risk aversion; there is currently minimal\n   IPv6 deployment or\
    \ operational experience and expertise, and the\n   carriers do not want to drive\
    \ development of this expertise.\n   Finally, some groups argue IPv4 is sufficient\
    \ for \"walled garden\"\n   use, using IPv4 private address space (i.e., the \"\
    net 10\" solution).\n   One other area of concern regarding IPv6 usage is perceived\
    \ memory\n   and processing overhead and its effect on small, limited capability\n\
    \   devices.  This was primarily directed at IPv6 requirement for IPsec\n   implementation\
    \ to claim conformance.  Arguments that continued\n   increase in device capacity\
    \ will obviate these concerns were\n   rejected.  It was stated that power constraints\
    \ on these low-end\n   devices will continue to force concerns on memory and processing\n\
    \   overhead, and impact introduction of other features.  There was no\n   conclusion\
    \ on whether IPsec could be made optional for these devices,\n   or the effect\
    \ if these devices were \"non-compliant\".\n   Emerging 3G cellular networks appear\
    \ ideal environment for IPv6\n   introduction.  IPv6 addresses scaling requirements\
    \ of wireless data\n   user projections and eliminates continued cobbling of systems\n\
    \   employing (IPv4) private address space and NAT.  This appears an area\n  \
    \ for IAB and Internet community to take a strong stance advocating\n   adoption\

    \   There were many examples where non-IETF standards organizations would\n  \
    \ like to directly adopt IETF standards to enable Internet (or similar)\n   services.\
    \  For example IEEE 802.11 WLAN relies on adoption of IETF\n   standards for mobile\
    \ IP, end-to-end security, and AAA services.  3GPP\n   is looking into the IETF\
    \ work on header compression.  WAPF derived\n   its transport, security, and application\
    \ environment from Internet\n   protocols.  At first glance these would seem successes\
    \ for adoption\n   of Internet technologies, however the decision to rely on IETF\n\
    \   standards often introduced frustrations too.\n   One common theme for frustration\
    \ is differences in standardization\n   procedures.  For instance, 3GPP follows\
    \ a strict model of publishing\n   recommendations yearly; any feature that cannot\
    \ be finalized must be\n   dropped.  On the other hand the IETF working groups\
    \ have much less\n   formalized schedules, and in fact often seem to ignore published\n\
    \   milestone dates.  This has led to a common perception within other\n   standards\
    \ organizations that the IETF cannot deliver [on time].\n   A second area identified\
    \ where IETF differs from other organizations\n   is in publication of \"system\
    \ profile\".  For example defining\n   interoperation of IPsec, QoS for VoIP and\
    \ video conferencing, and\n   billing as a \"service\".  Wading through all the\
    \ protocol\n   specifications, deciding on optional features and piecing together\n\
    \   the components to deliver a commercial quality service takes\n   considerable\
    \ expertise.\n   Thirdly, there was often confusion about how to get involved\
    \ in IETF\n   standards effort, submit requirements, and get delivery commitments.\n\
    \   Many people seem unaware and surprised at how open and simple it is\n   to\
    \ join in IETF standardization via working group meetings and\n   mailing list.\n\
    \   There wasn't really a large amount of discussions on ways to address\n   these\
    \ differences in standards practices.  However, it did seem\n   beneficial to\
    \ understand these concerns and frustrations.  It seemed\n   clear there can be\
