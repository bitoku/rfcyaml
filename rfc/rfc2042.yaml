  - "Process:\n   This document describes the process for creating new BGP attribute\n\
    \   type codes.  Basic attribute type codes are described in RFC 1771,\n   pages\
    \ 12 through 15.  These, and new attribute type codes that are\n   used in the\
    \ Internet are registered with the IANA.\n   The actual process will involve the\
    \ documentation of such attribute\n   type codes in an RFC.  There is no intention\
    \ of segmenting the code\n   space into public/private or IP/OSI or any other\
    \ sectioning.\n   As each attribute type code is in the process of being developed,\
    \ it\n   will use an octet value of 255, which will be reserved for this use.\n\
    \   At the time an attribute type code is assigned a number by the IANA,\n   the\
    \ documetnation and code base will be updated to reflect the\n   authorized attribute\
    \ type code value.\n   IANA maintained values will be published in the periodically\
    \ updated\n   Assigned Numbers RFC [6].  Requests for assignment of a new attribute\n\
    \   type code should be sent to the IANA (IANA@IANA.ORG) with a subject\n   that\
    \ includes the phrase \"BGP Attribute Type\".\n   Currently in use attribute type\
    \ codes are listed below:\n                 Value      Code                  \
