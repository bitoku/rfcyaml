  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) [RFC5357]\
    \ is an\n   extension of the One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP)\n   [RFC4656].\
    \  The TWAMP specification gathered wide review as it\n   approached completion,\
    \ and the by-products were several\n   recommendations for new features in TWAMP.\
    \  There is a growing number\n   of TWAMP implementations at present, and widespread\
    \ usage is\n   expected.  There are even devices that are designed to test\n \
    \  implementations for protocol compliance.\n   This memo describes a simple extension\
    \ for TWAMP: the option to use\n   different security modes in the TWAMP-Control\
    \ and TWAMP-Test\n   protocols (mixed security mode).  It also describes a new\
    \ IANA\n   registry for additional features, called the TWAMP Modes registry.\n\
    \   When the Server and Control-Client have agreed to use the mixed\n   security\
    \ mode during control connection setup, then the Control-\n   Client, the Server,\
    \ the Session-Sender, and the Session-Reflector\n   MUST all conform to the requirements\
    \ of this mode as described in\n   Sections 3, 4, and 5.\n   This memo updates\
    \ [RFC5357].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Requirements Language
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Purpose and Scope
  contents:
  - "2.  Purpose and Scope\n   The purpose of this memo is to describe and specify\
    \ an extension for\n   TWAMP [RFC5357], and to request the establishment of a\
    \ registry for\n   future TWAMP extensions.\n   The scope of the memo is limited\
    \ to specifications of the following:\n   o  Extension of the modes of operation\
    \ through assignment of one new\n      value in the Modes field (see Section 3.1\
    \ of [RFC4656]), while\n      retaining backward compatibility with TWAMP [RFC5357]\n\
    \      implementations.  This value adds the OPTIONAL ability to use\n      different\
    \ security modes in the TWAMP-Control and TWAMP-Test\n      protocols.  The motivation\
    \ for this extension is to permit the\n      low-packet-rate TWAMP-Control protocol\
    \ to utilize a stronger mode\n      of integrity protection than that used in\
    \ the TWAMP-Test protocol.\n"
- title: 3.  TWAMP Control Extensions
  contents:
  - "3.  TWAMP Control Extensions\n   The TWAMP-Control protocol is a derivative of\
    \ the OWAMP-Control\n   protocol, and coordinates a two-way measurement capability.\
    \  All\n   TWAMP-Control messages are similar in format and follow similar\n \
    \  guidelines to those defined in Section 3 of [RFC4656], with the\n   exceptions\
    \ described in TWAMP [RFC5357] and in the following\n   sections.\n   All OWAMP-Control\
    \ messages apply to TWAMP-Control, except for the\n   Fetch-Session command.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Extended Control Connection Setup
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Extended Control Connection Setup\n   TWAMP-Control connection establishment\
    \ follows the same procedure\n   defined in Section 3.1 of [RFC4656].  This extended\
    \ mode assigns one\n   new bit position (and value) to allow the Test protocol\
    \ security mode\n   to operate in Unauthenticated mode, while the Control protocol\n\
    \   operates in Encrypted mode.  With this extension, the complete set of\n  \
    \ TWAMP Mode values are as follows:\n   Value  Description             Reference/Explanation\n\
    \   0      Reserved\n   1      Unauthenticated         RFC 4656, Section 3.1\n\
    \   2      Authenticated           RFC 4656, Section 3.1\n   4      Encrypted\
    \               RFC 4656, Section 3.1\n   8      Unauth. TEST protocol,  new bit\
    \ position (3)\n          Encrypted CONTROL\n   In the original OWAMP and TWAMP\
    \ Modes field, setting bit position 0,\n   1, or 2 indicated the security mode\
    \ of the Control protocol, and the\n   Test protocol inherited the same mode (see\
    \ Section 4 of [RFC4656]).\n   In this extension to TWAMP, when the Control-Client\
    \ sets Modes Field\n   bit position 3, it SHALL discontinue the inheritance of\
    \ the security\n   mode in the Test protocol, and each protocol's mode SHALL be\
    \ as\n   specified below.  When the desired TWAMP-Test protocol mode is\n   identical\
    \ to the Control Session mode, the corresponding Modes Field\n   bit (position\
    \ 0, 1, or 2) SHALL be set by the Control-Client.  The\n   table below gives the\
    \ various combinations of integrity protection\n   that are permissible in TWAMP\
    \ (with this extension).  The TWAMP-\n   Control and TWAMP-Test protocols SHALL\
    \ use the mode in each column\n   corresponding to the bit position set in the\
    \ Modes Field.\n   --------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \   Protocol | Permissible Mode Combinations (Modes bit set)\n   --------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \   Control  |    Unauth.(0)|  Auth. == Encrypted (1,2,3)\n   --------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \            |    Unauth.(0)|         Unauth.  (3)\n            -----------------------------------------------\n\
    \   Test     |              |          Auth.(1)\n            -----------------------------------------------\n\
    \            |              |        Encrypted (2)\n   --------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \   Note that the TWAMP-Control protocol security measures are identical\n   in\
    \ the Authenticated and Encrypted Modes.  Therefore, only one new\n   bit position\
    \ (3) is needed to convey the single mixed security mode.\n   The value of the\
    \ Modes Field sent by the Server in the Server-\n   Greeting message is the bit-wise\
    \ OR of the modes (bit positions) that\n   it is willing to support during this\
    \ session.  Thus, the last four\n   bits of the 32-bit Modes Field are used. \
    \ When no other features are\n   activated, the first 28 bits MUST be zero.  A\
    \ client conforming to\n   this extension of [RFC5357] MAY ignore the values in\
    \ the first 28\n   bits of the Modes Field, or it MAY support other features that\
    \ are\n   communicated in these bit positions.\n   Other ways in which TWAMP extends\
    \ OWAMP are described in [RFC5357].\n"
- title: 4.  Extended TWAMP Test
  contents:
  - "4.  Extended TWAMP Test\n   The TWAMP-Test protocol is similar to the OWAMP-Test\
    \ protocol\n   [RFC4656] with the exception that the Session-Reflector transmits\n\
    \   test packets to the Session-Sender in response to each test packet it\n  \
    \ receives.  TWAMP [RFC5357] defines two different test packet formats:\n   one\
    \ for packets transmitted by the Session-Sender and one for packets\n   transmitted\
    \ by the Session-Reflector.  As with the OWAMP-Test\n   protocol, there are three\
    \ security modes that also determine the test\n   packet format: unauthenticated,\
    \ authenticated, and encrypted.  This\n   TWAMP extension makes it possible to\
    \ use TWAMP-Test Unauthenticated\n   mode regardless of the mode used in the TWAMP-Control\
    \ protocol.\n   When the Server has identified the ability to support the mixed\n\
    \   security mode, the Control-Client has selected the mixed security\n   mode\
    \ in its Set-Up-Response, and the Server has responded with a zero\n   Accept\
    \ field in the Server-Start message, these extensions are\n   REQUIRED.\n"

    \ stronger security/\n   integrity protection on the TWAMP-Control protocol while\n\
    \   simultaneously emphasizing accuracy or efficiency on the TWAMP-Test\n   protocol,\
    \ thus making it possible to increase overall security when\n   compared to the\
    \ previous options (when resource constraints would\n   have forced less security\
    \ for TWAMP-Control and conditions are such\n   that use of unauthenticated TWAMP-Test\
    \ is not a significant concern).\n   The security considerations that apply to\

    \ behavior\n   when the new mode is used.  According to this document, IANA created\n\
    \   a registry for the TWAMP Modes field.  This field is a recognized\n   extension\
    \ mechanism for TWAMP.\n"
- title: 6.1.  Registry Specification
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Registry Specification\n   IANA created a TWAMP Modes registry.  TWAMP\
    \ Modes are specified in\n   TWAMP Server Greeting messages and Set-up Response\
    \ messages\n   consistent with Section 3.1 of [RFC4656] and Section 3.1 of\n \
    \  [RFC5357], and extended by this memo.  Modes are currently indicated\n   by\
    \ setting single bits in the 32-bit Modes Field.  However, more\n   complex encoding\
    \ may be used in the future.  Thus, this registry can\n   contain a total of 2^32\
    \ possible assignments.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Registry Management
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Registry Management\n   Because the TWAMP Modes registry can contain a\
    \ maximum of 2^32\n   values, and because TWAMP is an IETF protocol, this registry\
    \ must be\n   updated only by \"IETF Review\" as specified in [RFC5226] (an RFC\n\
    \   documenting registry use that is approved by the IESG).  For the\n   TWAMP\
    \ Modes registry, we expect that new features will be assigned\n   using monotonically\
    \ increasing single bit positions and in the range\n   [0-31], unless there is\
    \ a good reason to do otherwise (more complex\n   encoding than single bit positions\
    \ may be used in the future, to\n   access the 2^32 value space).\n"
