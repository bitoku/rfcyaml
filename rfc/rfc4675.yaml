  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes Virtual LAN (VLAN) and re-prioritization\n\
    \   attributes that may prove useful for provisioning of access to IEEE\n   802\
    \ local area networks [IEEE-802] with the Remote Authentication\n   Dial-In User\
    \ Service (RADIUS) or Diameter.\n   While [RFC3580] enables support for VLAN assignment\
    \ based on the\n   tunnel attributes defined in [RFC2868], it does not provide\
    \ support\n   for a more complete set of VLAN functionality as defined by\n  \
    \ [IEEE-802.1Q].  The attributes defined in this document provide\n   support\
    \ within RADIUS and Diameter analogous to the management\n   variables supported\
    \ in [IEEE-802.1Q] and MIB objects defined in\n   [RFC4363].  In addition, this\
    \ document enables support for a wider\n   range of [IEEE-802.1X] configurations.\n"

    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 1.3.  Attribute Interpretation
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Attribute Interpretation\n   The attributes described in this document\
    \ apply to a single instance\n   of a NAS port, or more specifically an IEEE 802.1Q\
    \ bridge port.\n   [IEEE-802.1Q], [IEEE-802.1D], and [IEEE-802.1X] do not recognize\n\
    \   finer management granularity than \"per port\".  In some cases, such as\n\
    \   with IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs, the concept of a \"virtual port\" is\n   used\
    \ in place of the physical port.  Such virtual ports are typically\n   based on\
    \ security associations and scoped by station, or Media Access\n   Control (MAC)\
    \ address.\n   The attributes defined in this document are applied on a per-user\n\
    \   basis and it is expected that there is a single user per port;\n   however,\
    \ in some cases that port may be a \"virtual port\".  If a NAS\n   implementation\
    \ conforming to this document supports \"virtual ports\",\n   it may be possible\
    \ to provision those \"virtual ports\" with unique\n   values of the attributes\
    \ described in this document, allowing\n   multiple users sharing the same physical\
    \ port to each have a unique\n   set of authorization parameters.\n   If a NAS\
    \ conforming to this specification receives an Access-Accept\n   packet containing\
    \ an attribute defined in this document that it\n   cannot apply, it MUST act\
    \ as though it had received an Access-Reject.\n   [RFC3576] requires that a NAS\
    \ receiving a Change of Authorization\n   Request (CoA-Request) reply with a CoA-NAK\
    \ if the Request contains an\n   unsupported attribute.  It is recommended that\
    \ an Error-Cause\n   attribute with the value set to \"Unsupported Attribute\"\
    \ (401) be\n   included in the CoA-NAK.  As noted in [RFC3576], authorization\n\
    \   changes are atomic so that this situation does not result in session\n   termination\
    \ and the preexisting configuration remains unchanged.  As\n   a result, no accounting\
    \ packets should be generated.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Egress-VLANID\n   Description\n      The Egress-VLANID attribute represents\
    \ an allowed IEEE 802 Egress\n      VLANID for this port, indicating if the VLANID\
    \ is allowed for\n      tagged or untagged frames as well as the VLANID.\n   \
    \   As defined in [RFC3580], the VLAN assigned via tunnel attributes\n      applies\
    \ both to the ingress VLANID for untagged packets (known as\n      the PVID) and\
    \ the egress VLANID for untagged packets.  In\n      contrast, the Egress-VLANID\
    \ attribute configures only the egress\n      VLANID for either tagged or untagged\
    \ packets.  The Egress-VLANID\n      attribute MAY be included in the same RADIUS\
    \ packet as [RFC3580]\n      tunnel attributes; however, the Egress-VLANID attribute\
    \ is not\n      necessary if it is being used to configure the same untagged\n\
    \      VLANID included in tunnel attributes.  To configure an untagged\n     \
    \ VLAN for both ingress and egress, the tunnel attributes of\n      [RFC3580]\
    \ MUST be used.\n      Multiple Egress-VLANID attributes MAY be included in Access-\n\
    \      Request, Access-Accept, CoA-Request, or Accounting-Request\n      packets;\
    \ this attribute MUST NOT be sent within an Access-\n      Challenge, Access-Reject,\
    \ Disconnect-Request, Disconnect-ACK,\n      Disconnect-NAK, CoA-ACK, or CoA-NAK.\
    \  Each attribute adds the\n      specified VLAN to the list of allowed egress\

- title: 2.2.  Ingress-Filters
  contents:

    \ 8.4.5.  When the\n      attribute has the value \"Enabled\", the set of VLANs\

- title: 2.3.  Egress-VLAN-Name
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Egress-VLAN-Name\n   Description\n      Clause 12.10.2.1.3 (a) in [IEEE-802.1Q]\
    \ describes the\n      administratively assigned VLAN Name associated with a VLAN-ID\n\
    \      defined within an IEEE 802.1Q bridge.  The Egress-VLAN-Name\n      attribute\
    \ represents an allowed VLAN for this port.  It is similar\n      to the Egress-VLANID\
    \ attribute, except that the VLAN-ID itself is\n      not specified or known;\
    \ rather, the VLAN name is used to identify\n      the VLAN within the system.\n\
    \      The tunnel attributes described in [RFC3580] and the Egress-VLAN-\n   \
    \   Name attribute both can be used to configure the egress VLAN for\n      untagged\
    \ packets.  These attributes can be used concurrently and\n      MAY appear in\
    \ the same RADIUS packet.  When they do appear\n      concurrently, the list of\
    \ allowed VLANs is the concatenation of\n      the Egress-VLAN-Name and the Tunnel-Private-Group-ID\
    \ (81)\n      attributes.  The Egress-VLAN-Name attribute does not alter the\n\
    \      ingress VLAN for untagged traffic on a port (also known as the\n      PVID).\
    \  The tunnel attributes from [RFC3580] should be relied upon\n      instead to\
    \ set the PVID.\n      The Egress-VLAN-Name attribute contains two parts; the\
    \ first part\n      indicates if frames on the VLAN for this port are to be\n\
    \      represented in tagged or untagged format, the second part is the\n    \
    \  VLAN name.\n      Multiple Egress-VLAN-Name attributes MAY be included within\

- title: 2.4.  User-Priority-Table
  contents:
  - "2.4.  User-Priority-Table\n   Description\n      [IEEE-802.1D] clause 7.5.1 discusses\
    \ how to regenerate (or re-map)\n      user priority on frames received at a port.\
    \  This per-port\n      configuration enables a bridge to cause the priority of\
    \ received\n      traffic at a port to be mapped to a particular priority.\n \
    \     [IEEE-802.1D] clause 6.3.9 describes the use of remapping:\n         The\
    \ ability to signal user priority in IEEE 802 LANs allows\n         user priority\
    \ to be carried with end-to-end significance across\n         a Bridged Local\
    \ Area Network.  This, coupled with a consistent\n         approach to the mapping\
    \ of user priority to traffic classes and\n         of user priority to access_priority,\
    \ allows consistent use of\n         priority information, according to the capabilities\
    \ of the\n         Bridges and MACs in the transmission path...\n         Under\
    \ normal circumstances, user priority is not modified in\n         transit through\
    \ the relay function of a Bridge; however,\n         network management can control\
    \ how user priority is propagated.\n         Table 7-1 provides the ability to\
    \ map incoming user priority\n         values on a per-Port basis.  By default,\
    \ the regenerated user\n         priority is identical to the incoming user priority.\n\
    \      This attribute represents the IEEE 802 prioritization that will be\n  \
    \    applied to frames arriving at this port.  There are eight possible\n    \
    \  user priorities, according to the [IEEE-802] standard.\n      [IEEE-802.1D]\
    \ clause 14.6.2.3.3 specifies the regeneration table\n      as 8 values, each\
    \ an integer in the range 0-7.  The management\n      variables are described\
    \ in clause 14.6.2.2.\n      A single User-Priority-Table attribute MAY be included\
    \ in an\n      Access-Accept or CoA-Request packet; this attribute MUST NOT be\n\
    \      sent within an Access-Request, Access-Challenge, Access-Reject,\n     \
    \ Disconnect-Request, Disconnect-ACK, Disconnect-NAK, CoA-ACK, CoA-\n      NAK\
    \ or Accounting-Request.  Since the regeneration table is only\n      maintained\

    \   The attributes in this specification have no special translation\n   requirements\
    \ for Diameter to RADIUS or RADIUS to Diameter gateways;\n   they are copied as\
    \ is, except for changes relating to headers,\n   alignment, and padding.  See\
    \ also [RFC3588] Section 4.1 and [RFC4005]\n   Section 9.\n   What this specification\
    \ says about the applicability of the\n   attributes for RADIUS Access-Request\
    \ packets applies in Diameter to\n   AA-Request [RFC4005] or Diameter-EAP-Request\
    \ [RFC4072].  What is said\n   about Access-Challenge applies in Diameter to AA-Answer\
    \ [RFC4005] or\n   Diameter-EAP-Answer [RFC4072] with Result-Code AVP set to\n\
    \   DIAMETER_MULTI_ROUND_AUTH.\n   What is said about Access-Accept applies in\
    \ Diameter to AA-Answer or\n   Diameter-EAP-Answer messages that indicate success.\
    \  Similarly, what\n   is said about RADIUS Access-Reject packets applies in Diameter\
    \ to\n   AA-Answer or Diameter-EAP-Answer messages that indicate failure.\n  \
    \ What is said about COA-Request applies in Diameter to Re-Auth-Request\n   [RFC4005].\n\
    \   What is said about Accounting-Request applies to Diameter\n   Accounting-Request\
    \ [RFC4005] as well.\n"

  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   This specification does not create any new registries.\n\
    \   This document uses the RADIUS [RFC2865] namespace; see\n   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types>.\
    \  Allocation of four\n   updates for the section \"RADIUS Attribute Types\" has\
    \ been made by the\n   IANA.  The RADIUS attributes are:\n   56 - Egress-VLANID\n\

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This specification describes the use of RADIUS\
    \ and Diameter for\n   purposes of authentication, authorization, and accounting\
    \ in IEEE 802\n   local area networks.  RADIUS threats and security issues for\
    \ this\n   application are described in [RFC3579] and [RFC3580]; security issues\n\
    \   encountered in roaming are described in [RFC2607].  For Diameter, the\n  \
    \ security issues relating to this application are described in\n   [RFC4005]\
    \ and [RFC4072].\n   This document specifies new attributes that can be included\
    \ in\n   existing RADIUS packets, which are protected as described in\n   [RFC3579]\
    \ and [RFC3576].  In Diameter, the attributes are protected\n   as specified in\
    \ [RFC3588].  See those documents for a more detailed\n   description.\n   The\
    \ security mechanisms supported in RADIUS and Diameter are focused\n   on preventing\
    \ an attacker from spoofing packets or modifying packets\n   in transit.  They\
    \ do not prevent an authorized RADIUS/Diameter server\n   or proxy from inserting\
    \ attributes with malicious intent.\n   VLAN attributes sent by a RADIUS/Diameter\
    \ server or proxy may enable\n   access to unauthorized VLANs.  These vulnerabilities\
    \ can be limited\n   by performing authorization checks at the NAS.  For example,\
    \ a NAS\n   can be configured to accept only certain VLANIDs from a given\n  \
    \ RADIUS/Diameter server/proxy.\n   Similarly, an attacker gaining control of\
    \ a RADIUS/Diameter server or\n   proxy can modify the user priority table, causing\
    \ either degradation\n   of quality of service (by downgrading user priority of\
    \ frames\n   arriving at a port), or denial of service (by raising the level of\n\
    \   priority of traffic at multiple ports of a device, oversubscribing\n   the\
    \ switch or link capabilities).\n"
