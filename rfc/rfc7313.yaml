- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   It is sometimes necessary to perform routing consistency\
    \ validations\n   such as checking for possible missing route withdrawals between\
    \ BGP\n   speakers [RFC4271].  Currently, such validations typically involve\n\
    \   offline, manual operations that can be tedious and time-consuming.\n   In\
    \ this document, we enhance the existing BGP route refresh\n   mechanisms [RFC2918]\
    \ to provide for the demarcation of the beginning\n   and the ending of a route\
    \ refresh (which refers to the complete\n   re-advertisement of the Adj-RIB-Out\
    \ to a peer, subject to routing\n   policies).  The enhancement can be used to\
    \ facilitate online, non-\n   disruptive consistency validation of BGP routing\
    \ updates.\n   This document updates [RFC2918] by redefining a field in the ROUTE-\n\
    \   REFRESH message that was previously designated as Reserved.\n"
- title: 2.  Requirements Language
  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119] only when\n   they appear in all upper case.  They may also appear\
    \ in lower or\n   mixed case as English words, without any normative meaning.\n"
- title: 3.  Protocol Extensions
  contents:
  - "3.  Protocol Extensions\n   The BGP protocol extensions introduced in this document\
    \ include the\n   definition of a new BGP capability, named \"Enhanced Route Refresh\n\
    \   Capability\", and the specification of the message subtypes for the\n   ROUTE-REFRESH\
    \ message.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Enhanced Route Refresh Capability
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Enhanced Route Refresh Capability\n   The \"Enhanced Route Refresh Capability\"\
    \ is a new BGP capability\n   [RFC5492].  IANA has assigned a Capability Code\
    \ of 70 for this\n   capability.  The Capability Length field of this capability\
    \ is zero.\n   By advertising this capability to a peer, a BGP speaker conveys\
    \ to\n   the peer that the speaker supports the message subtypes for the\n   ROUTE-REFRESH\
    \ message and the related procedures described in this\n   document.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Subtypes for ROUTE-REFRESH Message
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Subtypes for ROUTE-REFRESH Message\n   The \"Reserved\" field of the ROUTE-REFRESH\
    \ message specified in\n   [RFC2918] is redefined as the \"Message Subtype\" with\
    \ the following\n   values:\n             0 - Normal route refresh request [RFC2918]\n\
    \                 with/without Outbound Route Filtering (ORF) [RFC5291]\n    \
    \         1 - Demarcation of the beginning of a route refresh\n              \
    \   (BoRR) operation\n             2 - Demarcation of the ending of a route refresh\n\
    \                 (EoRR) operation\n           255 - Reserved\n   The remaining\
    \ values of the message subtypes are reserved for future\n   use; see Section\
    \ 6 (\"IANA Considerations\").  The use of the new\n   message subtypes is described\
    \ in Section 4 (\"Operation\").\n"
- title: 4.  Operation
  contents:
  - "4.  Operation\n   A BGP speaker that supports the message subtypes for the ROUTE-\n\
    \   REFRESH message and the related procedures SHOULD advertise the\n   \"Enhanced\
    \ Route Refresh Capability\".\n   The following procedures are applicable only\
    \ if a BGP speaker has\n   received the \"Enhanced Route Refresh Capability\"\
    \ from a peer.\n   Before the speaker starts a route refresh that is either initiated\n\
    \   locally, or in response to a \"normal route refresh request\" from the\n \
    \  peer, the speaker MUST send a BoRR message.  After the speaker\n   completes\
    \ the re-advertisement of the entire Adj-RIB-Out to the peer,\n   it MUST send\
    \ an EoRR message.\n   Conceptually, the \"entire Adj-RIB-Out\" for a peer in\
    \ this section\n   refers to all the route entries in the \"Adj-RIB-Out\" for\
    \ the peer at\n   the start of the route refresh operation.  These route entries\n\
    \   comprise both the reachability as well as unreachability information.\n  \
    \ When a route entry in the \"Adj-RIB-Out\" changes, only the modified\n   route\
    \ entry needs to be advertised.\n   In processing a ROUTE-REFRESH message from\
    \ a peer, the BGP speaker\n   MUST examine the \"message subtype\" field of the\
    \ message and take the\n   appropriate actions.  The message processing rules\
    \ for ROUTE-REFRESH\n   message with subtype of 0 are described in [RFC2918] and\
    \ [RFC5291].\n   A BGP speaker can receive a BoRR message from a peer at any time,\n\
    \   either as a result of a peer responding to a ROUTE-REFRESH message,\n   or\
    \ as a result of a peer unilaterally initiating a route refresh.\n   When a BGP\
    \ speaker receives a BoRR message from a peer, it MUST mark\n   all the routes\
    \ with the given Address Family Identifier and\n   Subsequent Address Family Identifier,\
    \ <AFI, SAFI> [RFC2918], from\n   that peer as stale.  As it receives routes from\
    \ its peer's subsequent\n   Adj-RIB-Out re-advertisement, these replace any corresponding\
    \ stale\n   routes.  When a BGP speaker receives an EoRR message from a peer,\
    \ it\n   MUST immediately remove any routes from the peer that are still\n   marked\
    \ as stale for that <AFI, SAFI>.  Such purged routes MAY be\n   logged for future\
    \ analysis.  A BGP speaker MAY ignore any EoRR\n   message received without a\
    \ prior receipt of an associated BoRR\n   message.  Such messages MAY be logged\
    \ for future analysis.\n   An implementation MAY impose a locally configurable\
    \ upper bound on\n   how long it would retain any stale routes.  Once the upper\
    \ bound is\n   reached, the implementation MAY remove any routes from the peer\
    \ that\n   are still marked as stale for that <AFI, SAFI> without waiting for\
    \ an\n   EoRR message.\n   The following procedures are specified in order to\
    \ simplify the\n   interaction with the BGP Graceful Restart [RFC4724].  In particular,\n\
    \   these procedures ensure that End-of-RIB (EoR) defined in Graceful\n   Restart\
    \ and EoRR as defined in this specification are kept separate,\n   thereby avoiding\
    \ any premature cleanup of stale routes.  For a BGP\n   speaker that supports\
    \ the BGP Graceful Restart, it MUST NOT send a\n   BoRR for an <AFI, SAFI> to\
    \ a neighbor before it sends the EoR for the\n   <AFI, SAFI> to the neighbor.\
    \  A BGP speaker that has received the\n   Graceful Restart Capability from its\
    \ neighbor MUST ignore any BoRRs\n   for an <AFI, SAFI> from the neighbor before\
    \ the speaker receives the\n   EoR for the given <AFI, SAFI> from the neighbor.\
    \  The BGP speaker\n   SHOULD log an error of the condition for further analysis.\n"
- title: 5.  Error Handling
  contents:
  - "5.  Error Handling\n   This document defines a new NOTIFICATION error code:\n\
    \          Error Code   Name\n              7        ROUTE-REFRESH Message Error\n\
    \   The following error subcode is defined as well:\n          Subcode      Name\n\
    \             1         Invalid Message Length\n   The error handling specified\
    \ in this section is applicable only when\n   a BGP speaker has received the \"\
    Enhanced Route Refresh Capability\"\n   from a peer.\n   If the length, excluding\
    \ the fixed-size message header, of the\n   received ROUTE-REFRESH message with\
    \ Message Subtype 1 and 2 is not 4,\n   then the BGP speaker MUST send a NOTIFICATION\
    \ message with the Error\n   Code of \"ROUTE-REFRESH Message Error\" and the subcode\
    \ of \"Invalid\n   Message Length\".  The Data field of the NOTIFICATION message\
    \ MUST\n   contain the complete ROUTE-REFRESH message.\n   When the BGP speaker\
    \ receives a ROUTE-REFRESH message with a \"Message\n   Subtype\" field other\
    \ than 0, 1, or 2, it MUST ignore the received\n   ROUTE-REFRESH message.  It\
    \ SHOULD log an error for further analysis.\n"
