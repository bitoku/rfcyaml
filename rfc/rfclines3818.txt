Abstract The charter of the Point to Point Protocol (PPP) Extensions working group (pppext) includes the responsibility to "actively advance PPP's most useful extensions to full standard, while defending against further enhancements of questionable value.
In support of that charter, the allocation of PPP protocol and other assigned numbers will no longer be "first come first served."
Introduction The Point to Point protocol (PPP, RFC 1661 [1]) is a mature protocol with a large number of subprotocols, encapsulations and other extensions.
The main protocol as well as its extensions involve many name spaces in which values must be assigned.
http://www.iana.org/assignments/ppp numbers contains a list of the address spaces and their current assignments.
Historically, initial values in new name spaces have often been chosen in the RFCs creating the name spaces.
The IANA made subsequent assignments with a "First Come First Served" policy.
This memo changes that policy for some PPP address spaces.
Most of the PPP names spaces are quiescent, but some continue to attract proposed extensions.
Extensions of PPP have been defined in RFCs that are "Informational" and so are not subject to review.
These extensions usually require values assigned in one or more of the PPP name spaces.
Making these allocations require "IETF Consensus" will ensure that proposals are reviewed.
The terms "name space", "assigned value", and "registration" are used here with the meanings defined in BCP 26 [2].
The policies "First Come First Served" and "IETF Consensus" used here also have the meanings defined in BCP 26.
IANA Considerations for PPP IETF Consensus, usually through the Point to Point Protocol Extensions working group (pppext), is required for assigning new values in the following address spaces:
PPP DLL PROTOCOL NUMBERS PPP LCP AND IPCP CODES PPP LCP CONFIGURATION OPTION
TYPES PPP CCP CONFIGURATION OPTION TYPES PPP CHAP AUTHENTICATION ALGORITHMS PPP

This memo deals with matters of process, not protocol.
