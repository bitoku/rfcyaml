  - "Abstract\n   The Internet Group Management Protocol Version 3 (IGMPv3) and the\n\
    \   Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol Version 2 (MLDv2) are protocols\n  \
    \ that allow a host to inform its neighboring routers of its desire to\n   receive\
    \ IPv4 and IPv6 multicast transmissions, respectively.\n   Source-specific multicast\
    \ (SSM) is a form of multicast in which a\n   receiver is required to specify\
    \ both the network-layer address of the\n   source and the multicast destination\
    \ address in order to receive the\n   multicast transmission.  This document defines\
    \ the notion of an\n   \"SSM-aware\" router and host, and clarifies and (in some\
    \ cases)\n   modifies the behavior of IGMPv3 and MLDv2 on SSM-aware routers and\n\
    \   hosts to accommodate source-specific multicast.  This document\n   updates\
    \ the IGMPv3 and MLDv2 specifications.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) [RFC1112,\
    \ IGMPv2,\n   IGMPv3] allows an IPv4 host to communicate IP multicast group\n\
    \   membership information to its neighboring routers.  IGMP version 3\n   (IGMPv3)\
    \ [IGMPv3] provides the ability for a host to selectively\n   request or filter\
    \ traffic from individual sources within a multicast\n   group.\n   The Multicast\
    \ Listener Discovery Protocol (MLD) [RFC2710, MLDv2]\n   offers similar functionality\
    \ for IPv6 hosts.  MLD version 2 (MLDv2)\n   provides the analogous \"source filtering\"\
    \ functionality of IGMPv3 for\n   IPv6.\n   Due to the commonality of function,\
    \ the term \"Group Management\n   Protocol\", or \"GMP\", will be used to refer\
    \ to both IGMP and MLD.  The\n   term \"Source Filtering GMP\", or \"SFGMP\",\
    \ will be used to refer\n   jointly to the IGMPv3 and MLDv2 group management protocols.\n\
    \   The use of source-specific multicast is facilitated by small changes\n   to\
    \ the SFGMP protocols on both hosts and routers.  [SSM] defines\n   general requirements\
    \ that must be followed by systems that implement\n   the SSM service model; this\
    \ document defines the concrete application\n   of those requirements to systems\
    \ that implement IGMPv3 and MLDv2.  In\n   doing so, this document defines modifications\
    \ to the host and router\n   portions of IGMPv3 and MLDv2 for use with SSM, and\
    \ presents a number\n   of clarifications to their behavior when used with SSM\
    \ addresses.\n   This document updates the IGMPv3 and MLDv2 specifications.\n"

- title: 2.  Host Requirements for Source-Specific Multicast
  contents:
  - "2.  Host Requirements for Source-Specific Multicast\n   This section defines\
    \ the notion of an \"SSM-aware\" host and then goes\n   on to describe the API\
    \ requirements and the SFGMP protocol\n   requirements of an SSM-aware host. \
    \ It is important to note that SSM\n   can be used by any host that supports source\
    \ filtering APIs and whose\n   operating system supports the appropriate SFGMP.\
    \  The SFGMP\n   modifications described in this section make SSM work better\
    \ on an\n   SSM-aware host, but they are not strict prerequisites for the use\
    \ of\n   SSM.\n   The 232/8 IPv4 address range is currently allocated for SSM\
    \ by IANA\n   [IANA-ALLOCATION].  In IPv6, the FF3x::/32 range (where 'x' is a\n\
    \   valid IPv6 multicast scope value) is reserved for SSM semantics\n   [RFC3306],\
    \ although today SSM allocations are restricted to\n   FF3x::/96.  ([SSM] has\
    \ a more thorough discussion of this topic.)  A\n   host that knows the SSM address\
    \ range and is capable of applying SSM\n   semantics to it is described as an\
    \ \"SSM-aware\" host.\n   A host or router may be configured to apply SSM semantics\
    \ to\n   addresses other than those in the IANA-allocated range.  The GMP\n  \
    \ module on a host or router SHOULD have a configuration option to set\n   the\
    \ SSM address range(s).  If this configuration option exists, it\n   MUST default\
    \ to the IANA-allocated SSM range.  The mechanism for\n   setting this configuration\
    \ option MUST at least allow for manual\n   configuration.  Protocol mechanisms\
    \ to set this option may be defined\n   in the future.\n"
- title: 2.1.  API Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.1.  API Requirements\n   If the host IP module of an SSM-aware host receives\
    \ a non-source-\n   specific request to receive multicast traffic sent to an SSM\n\
    \   destination address, it SHOULD return an error to the application, as\n  \
    \ specified in [MSFAPI] (MODIFICATION).  On a non-SSM-aware host, an\n   application\
    \ that uses the wrong API (e.g., \"join(G)\",\n   \"IPMulticastListen(G,EXCLUDE(S1))\"\
    \ for IGMPv3, or\n   \"IPv6MulticastListen(G,EXCLUDE(S2))\" for MLDv2) to request\
    \ delivery\n   of packets sent to an SSM address will not receive the requested\n\
    \   service, because an SSM-aware router (following the rules of this\n   document)\
    \ will refuse to process the request, and the application\n   will receive no\
    \ indication other than a failure to receive the\n   requested traffic.\n"

  - "2.2.  GMP Requirements\n   This section defines the behavior of the SFGMP protocol\
    \ module on an\n   SSM-aware host, including two modifications to the protocols\
    \ as\n   described in [IGMPv3, MLDv2].  It also includes a number of\n   clarifications\
    \ of protocol operations.  In doing so, it documents the\n   behavior of an SSM-aware\
    \ host with respect to sending and receiving\n   the following GMP message types:\n\

  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  IGMPv1/v2 and MLDv1 Reports\n   An SSM-aware host operating according\
    \ to [IGMPv3, MLDv2] could send\n   an IGMPv1, IGMPv2, or MLDv1 report for an\
    \ SSM address when it is\n   operating in \"older-version compatibility mode.\"\
    \  This is an\n   exceptional (error) condition, indicating that the router(s)\
    \ cannot\n   provide the SFGMP support needed for SSM, and an error is logged\
    \ when\n   the host enters compatibility mode for an SSM address, as described\n\
    \   below.  In this situation, it is likely that traffic sent to a\n   channel\
    \ (S,G) will not be delivered to a receiving host that has\n   requested to receive\
    \ channel (S,G).\n   [IGMPv3] and [MLDv2] specify that a host MAY allow an older-version\n\
    \   report to suppress its own IGMPv3 or MLDv2 Membership Record.  An\n   SSM-aware\
    \ host, however, MUST NOT allow its report to be suppressed\n   in this situation\
    \ (MODIFICATION).  Suppressing reports in this\n   scenario would provide an avenue\

    \ BLOCK_OLD_SOURCES as part of a State-Change Record\n   A report may include\
    \ both SSM destination addresses and non-source-\n   specific, i.e., Any-Source\
    \ Multicast (ASM) destination addresses, in\n   the same message.\n   Additionally,\
    \ a CHANGE_TO_INCLUDE_MODE record may be sent by a host\n   in some cases, for\
    \ instance, when the SSM address range is changed\n   through configuration. \
    \ A router should process such a record\n   according to the normal SFGMP rules.\n\
    \   An SSM-aware host SHOULD NOT send any of the following record types\n   for\

    \      - CHANGE_TO_EXCLUDE_MODE as part of a Filter-Mode-Change Record\n   This\
    \ is a MODIFICATION to [IGMPv3, MLDv2], imposing a restriction on\n   its use\
    \ for SSM destination addresses.  The rationale is that EXCLUDE\n   mode does\
    \ not apply to SSM addresses, and an SSM-aware router will\n   ignore MODE_IS_EXCLUDE\
    \ and CHANGE_TO_EXCLUDE_MODE requests in the SSM\n   range, as described below.\n"

  - "2.2.3.  IGMPv1 Queries, IGMPv2 and MLDv1 General Queries\n   If an IGMPv1 Query,\

    \ require the host to revert to the\n   older (IGMPv1, IGMPv2, or MLDv1) mode\
    \ of operation on that interface.\n   If this occurs, the host will stop reporting\
    \ source-specific\n   subscriptions on that interface and will start using IGMPv1,\
    \ IGMPv2,\n   or MLDv1 to report interest in all SSM destination addresses,\n\
    \   unqualified by a source address.  As a result, SSM semantics will no\n   longer\
    \ be applied to the multicast group address by the router.\n   A router compliant\
    \ with this document would never generate an IGMPv1,\n   IGMPv2, or MLDv1 query\
    \ for an address in the SSM range; thus, this\n   situation only occurs either\
    \ if the router is not SSM-aware, or if\n   the host and the router disagree about\
    \ the SSM address range (for\n   instance, if they have inconsistent manual configurations).\n\
    \   A host SHOULD log an error if it receives an IGMPv1, IGMPv2, or MLDv1\n  \
