  - "Abstract\n   In the spirit of RFC # 369, Evaluation of ARPANET resources, a new\n\
    \   test group was organized at UCSB to take a detailed look at specific\n   network\
    \ resources and develop initial site dependent and function\n   dependent MINIMAN's\
    \ (Concise User Manuals).  As the group was again\n   composed of novices, initial\
    \ effort revolved about basic procedural\n   indoctrination.  In the period between\
    \ January and March 1973 a\n   number of resources were investigated with varying\
    \ degrees of\n   success, as to availability, proper usage, sample problem solutions,\n\
    \   and access to help and documentation.  Included in this paper are a\n   summary\
    \ of the projects undertaken, initial suggestions at MINIMAN\n   composition,\
    \ and suggestions for future test groups.  As these groups\n   are attempting\
    \ to perform a useful function for the ARPANET\n   community, comments and suggestions\
    \ are requested.  Copies of the\n   reports described herein are available on\
    \ request from the Computer\n   Systems Laboratory at UCSB.\n"
- title: Resources Investigated by the Group
  contents:
  - "Resources Investigated by the Group\n   I.  APL\n      APL was investigated primarily\
    \ at MULTICS.  UCSD was also\n      scheduled for evaluation but not carried out.\
    \  APL at MULTICS was\n      used to solve a few trivial problems.  Most effort\
    \ revolved about\n      the difficult task of obtaining any available documentation.\
    \  The\n      octal codes for APL characters were obtained and mapped into the\n\
    \      OLS keyboard.  A side goal of the project, the comparison of APL\n    \
    \  with OLS, was begun but progressed very little.\n   II.  Basic\n      Basic\
    \ was investigated at a number of TENEX sites.  Differences\n      between sites\
    \ were pointed out and necessary file manipulation\n      commands were documented.\
    \  An integration problem was written at\n      one site, sent via FTP to another\
    \ site, and then run again to show\n      comparative execution times and compatability.\
    \  Non-PDP/10 sites\n      were investigated but no report was submitted.\n  \
    \ III.  TSO\n      IBM's Time Sharing option was exercised at UCLA-CCN.  Interesting\n\
    \      results were obtained regarding cost and execution time.\n      Available\
    \ commands were documented and a PL/1 program was written\n      and executed.\n\
    \   IV.  MIT-MATHLAB\n      This, the most successful of the projects, involved\
    \ documentation\n      of help, file manipulation, and MACSYMA access and an original\n\
    \      research project in resource sharing.  A recursive problem in\n      pattern\
    \ recognition and a triple integration were solved to\n      demonstrate MACSYMA\
    \ generated expressions into user programs on\n      the OLS.  More information\
    \ on this project is forthcoming.\n   V.  Local User Guide\n      A first pass\
    \ network users manual was completed for UCSB users.\n      In it are described\
    \ console access and settings, character\n      mappings, current servers, users\
    \ and TIPs, and error conditions.\n      Following minor revisions this guide\
    \ will be distributed to local\n      users.\n   VI.  Local IMLAC Access to Network\n\
    \      Access to network graphics programs was attempted with a local\n      IMLAC.\
    \  Due to the non-uniformity of network IMLACs very little\n      success was\
    \ obtained.  However, a program to access SRI-ARC's NLS\n      was compiled and\
    \ loaded from NIC and attempts were made to iron\n      out the bugs.  In addition\
    \ a project was begun to maintain an\n      IMLAC library and compiler locally\
    \ for network usage.  As in the\n      other projects, basic operating procedures\
    \ were documented.\n   VII.  Harvard Graphics\n      Several attempts were made\
    \ to learn of availability of graphics\n      access to organic molecule synthesis\
    \ programs but no response\n      could be generated.  This project was eventually\
    \ abandoned.\n"
- title: MINIMAN Composition
  contents:
  - "MINIMAN Composition\n   As mentioned in a previous report, concise manuals are\
    \ needed for\n   network resources so that uniniated users may gain basic familiarity\n\
    \   with foreign systems.  In addition, manuals which describe specific\n   network\
    \ wide functions, such as Fortran compilors, are needed if\n   resource sharing\
    \ is to become a real trait of the ARPANET.  For the\n   resources evaluated,\
    \ each group member submitted two reports\n   analagous to the two types of MINIMANS\
    \ needed in the network.  The\n   headings and format of the reports will be included\
    \ here to stimulate\n   future discussion on MINIMAN composition.\n   REPORT #\
    \ 1: Online Help for [a specific host computer]\n         I.  Connection, Login,\
    \ and Optimal TELNET Settings\n        II.  Help Files\n       III.  Job Status\n\
    \        IV.  Time of Day\n         V.  Time/Money  Used/Left\n        VI.  Interpersonal\
    \ Communications\n             A. Console Linking\n             B. Location of\

- title: Future Test Groups
  contents:
  - "Future Test Groups\n   A number of projects are envisioned for future resource\
    \ evaluators\n   and include:\n   1. Complete evaluation of APL at MULTICS and\
    \ UCSD with comparison to\n      the On-Line System (OLS).\n   2. Investigate\
    \ BASIC in depth, network wide.\n   3. Evaluate other symbolic manipulation programs\
    \ such as REDUCE.\n   4. Summarize all games available in the network.\n   5.\
    \ Find and evaluate specific application programs such as ZOG or the\n      weather\
    \ data base at CCA.\n   The projects undertaken will be determined in part by\
    \ local\n   interests.  But a serious effort is being made for reports to\n  \
    \ accompany each evaluation.\n"
- title: Conclusion
  contents:
  - "Conclusion\n   Good results have been obtained from the two test groups thus\
    \ far.\n   Although composed of novices, as far as network familiarity is\n  \
    \ concerned, the groups have been able to produce data and reports\n   which benefit\
    \ the network community.  The reports run the gambit from\n   poor to excellent,\
    \ but even the poorer ones have generated results by\n   motivating more knowledgeable\
    \ system personnel to find time to write\n   the report in the \"right\" way.\
    \  All data and reports compiled by\n   these groups are available to interested\
    \ network users.  In addition,\n   any information or documentation or manuals\
    \ which might fit into the\n   framework of the MINIMAN is requested from the\
    \ network community.  As\n   this information begins to be collected, the network\
    \ may truly start\n   to become a resource sharing network.\n         [ This RFC\
    \ was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n         [ into the online RFC\
    \ archives by Nasser M. Akhtar 2/98 ]\n"
