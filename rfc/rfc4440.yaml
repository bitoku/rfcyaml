  - "1.  Introduction\n   As part of the process of appointing a new chair of the\
    \ Internet\n   Research Task Force (IRTF), the IAB considered the future role\
    \ of the\n   IRTF both on its own and in relationship to the IETF.  The IAB has\n\
    \   expanded this discussion into this IAB report on the role of the\n   IRTF,\
    \ and circulated this document for wider community review.  (As\n   one result\
    \ of this discussion, Aaron Falk was appointed the new chair\n   of the IRTF in\
    \ March 2005.)\n"
- title: 2.  The Relationship between the IRTF, the IAB, and the IETF
  contents:
  - "2.  The Relationship between the IRTF, the IAB, and the IETF\n   Before 1989,\
    \ the IAB (then called the Internet Activities Board)\n   oversaw a number of\
    \ task forces.  In 1989, organizational changes\n   were made to coalesce these\
    \ task forces into two groups, the IETF and\n   the IRTF.  The IRTF was tasked\
    \ to consider long-term research\n   problems in the Internet, and the IETF was\
    \ to concentrate on short-\n   to medium-term engineering issues related to the\
    \ Internet.  At this\n   time, all of the task forces except the IETF were restructured\
    \ as\n   IRTF research groups.  For example, the End-to-End Task Force became\n\
    \   the IRTF's End-to-End Research Group (E2ERG) and the Privacy &\n   Security\
    \ Task Force became the IRTF's Privacy & Security Research\n   Group (PSRG) [IABWebPages]\
    \ [RFC3160] [E2ERG].\n   Much of the early participation in the IETF as well as\
    \ in the IRTF\n   was from the academic and research communities.  (We don't have\
    \ a\n   citation from this, but a look at the members of the IAB from the\n  \
    \ 1980's and early 1990's shows IAB members from institutions such as\n   MIT,\
    \ UCLA, BBN, UCL, SDSC, and the like, while IAB members from the\n   last few\
    \ years were more likely to list their organizations at the\n   time of service\
    \ as Cisco, IBM, Microsoft, Nokia, Qualcomm, and\n   Verisign [IABWebPages]. \
    \ We expect that a study of authors of RFCs\n   would show a similar trend over\
    \ time, with fewer authors from the\n   academic and research communities, and\
    \ more authors from the\n   commercial world.)  While the IRTF has continued to\
    \ have significant\n   participation from the academic and research communities,\
    \ the IETF\n   has focused on standards development and has become dominated by\
    \ the\n   needs of the commercial sector.\n   The IRTF has generally focused on\
    \ investigation into areas that are\n   not considered sufficiently mature for\
    \ IETF standardization, as well\n   as investigation of areas that are not specifically\
    \ the subject of\n   standardization, but could guide future standards efforts.\n\
    \   The IRTF Research Groups guidelines and procedures are described in\n   RFC\
    \ 2014.  The IRTF Chair is appointed by the Internet Architecture\n   Board (IAB),\
    \ and charters IRTF research groups (RGs) in consultation\n   with the Internet\
    \ Research Steering Group (IRSG) and with approval of\n   the IAB.  The chairs\
    \ of the RGs comprise the main part of the IRSG,\n   although the IRTF Chair can\
    \ also appoint at-large members to the\n   IRSG.\n   As RFC 2014 states, the IRTF\
    \ does not set standards.  While\n   technologies developed in an RG can be brought\
    \ to the IETF for\n   possible standardization, \"Research Group input carries\
    \ no more\n   weight than other community input, and goes through the same\n \
    \  standards setting process as any other proposal\" [RFC2014] (Section\n   1.1).\
    \  This is necessary to ensure that RGs don't become a part of\n   the standards\
    \ process itself.\n   RFC 2014 continues to say that \"since the products are\
    \ research\n   results, not Internet standards, consensus of the group is not\n\
    \   required\" [RFC2014] (Section 3).  However, the NameSpace Research\n   Group\
    \ was one RG that did require consensus decisions; this group was\n   chartered\
    \ exclusively to make a recommendation to the IETF.\n   RFC 2014 goes on to describe\
    \ Research Group operation, meeting\n   management, staff roles, group documents,\
    \ and the like.  This\n   document is not a revision of RFC 2014, but instead\
    \ a more wide-\n   ranging discussion of the possible roles of the IRTF.\n   The\
    \ past history of IRTF Chairs is as follows: Dave Clark\n   (1989-1992); Jon Postel\
    \ (1992-1995); Abel Weinrib (1995-1999); Erik\n   Huizer (1999-2001); Vern Paxson\
    \ (2001-2005).\n"
- title: 2.1.  Differences between IRTF and IETF Groups
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Differences between IRTF and IETF Groups\n   Two key differences between\
    \ IRTF research groups and IETF working\n   groups are that IRTF groups are not\
    \ trying to produce standards of\n   any kind and that the output of IRTF groups\
    \ does not require\n   consensus within the RG, or broad consensus from the IETF.\n\
    \   In some cases, IRTF groups have acted as research groups with minimal\n  \
    \ constraints, creating a community for discussing research proposals,\n   with\
    \ mature proposals \"tossed over the fence\" to an IETF group for\n   standardization.\
    \  The Reliable Multicast Research Group (RMRG) was an\n   example of such a group,\
    \ with standardization efforts in the Reliable\n   Multicast Transport working\
    \ group (RMT).\n"
- title: 2.2.  Research Groups as Non-blocking Entities
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Research Groups as Non-blocking Entities\n   As stated in RFC 2014, the\
    \ IRTF does not set standards.  It is\n   important that, unless clearly specified\
    \ otherwise by the IESG,\n   research groups do not act as gateways controlling\
    \ the advancement of\n   standards, experimental RFCs, or informational RFCs produced\
    \ by\n   working groups in the IETF.\n   Similarly, as stated in RFC 2014, existing\
    \ research groups also do\n   not necessarily prevent the creation of new research\
    \ groups in\n   related areas.  Of course, when considering a proposal for a new\n\
    \   research group, it is perfectly appropriate for the IRTF and the IAB\n   to\
    \ consider the relationship with existing research groups.  However,\n   \"multiple\
    \ Research Groups working in the same general area may be\n   formed if appropriate\"\
    \ [RFC2014] (Sections 1.1 and 2.1).\n"
- title: 3.  The Range of IRTF Groups
  contents:
  - "3.  The Range of IRTF Groups\n   There is a wide range of ways that IRTF groups\
    \ can currently be\n   structured.  Some of the most significant are:\n   * Membership:\
    \  Groups might be open or closed (in terms of\n     membership).  The End-to-End\
    \ Research Group and the NameSpace\n     Research Group are both past examples\
    \ of closed RGs.\n   * Timescale:  While RGs are generally long-term, groups could\
    \ be\n     either long-term (ongoing) or short-term with a specific goal; the\n\
    \     NameSpace Research Group is an example of an RG that was chartered\n   \
    \  as a short-lived group [NSRG].  We note that RFC 2014, written in\n     1996,\
    \ assumed that RGs would be long-term: \"Research Groups are\n     expected to\
    \ have the stable long term membership needed to promote\n     the development\
    \ of research collaboration and teamwork in exploring\n     research issues\"\
    \ [RFC2014] (Section 1).\n   * Relationship to IETF:  Groups can include a goal\
    \ of producing\n     proposals to be considered in the IETF (e.g., the Anti-Spam\n\
    \     Research Group) or can be independent of any current or proposed\n     work\
    \ in the IETF (e.g., the Delay-Tolerant Networking Research\n     Group).\n  \
    \ * Range of activities:  IRTF activities could consist not only of\n     research\
    \ groups and their associated meetings, workshops, and other\n     activities,\
    \ but also of separate workshops or other one-time\n     activities organized\
    \ directly by the IRTF.  To date, however, the\n     IRTF has not organized such\
    \ activities other than in the form of\n     BOFs at IETF meetings.\n   * Both\
    \ research and development: IRTF groups can focus on traditional\n     research\
    \ activities, but they could also focus on development, on\n     tool-building,\
    \ on operational testing or protocol interoperability\n     testing, or on other\
    \ activities that don't fit the framework of a\n     working group (WG).  Instead\
    \ of having a specific plan for the\n     evolution of the IRTF, we think that\
    \ this will have to be explored\n     over time, with discussions between the\
    \ IRTF Chair, the IRSG, and\n     the IAB (and with the IESG as appropriate).\n\
    \   As discussed above, the IAB believes that the range of research\n   groups\
    \ could be expanded further, in terms of timescale, relationship\n   to the IETF,\
    \ range of activities, and range between research and\n   development.\n"
- title: 4.  Issues for the Future
  contents:
  - "4.  Issues for the Future\n   This section discusses some of the issues in the\
    \ future evolution of\n   the IRTF.  A key issue, discussed in Section 4.1 below,\
    \ concerns how\n   the IRTF can best contribute on questions of network architecture.\n\
    \   Similar issues could be raised in how the IRTF can best contribute to\n  \
    \ incubating technology for later development in the IETF.  We\n   emphasize that\
    \ we are not proposing that the IRTF should become a de\n   facto holding point\
    \ for technologies that are not making clear\n   progress in the WGs.  Some technologies\
    \ might not make progress in\n   WGs because of key open issues, making an RG\
    \ an appropriate step.\n   Other technologies, however, might not make progress\
    \ in WGs because\n   of a lack of interest, inherent design weaknesses, or some\
    \ other\n   reason that does not justify moving it into an RG instead.\n"
- title: 4.1.  IRTF Groups and Network Architecture
  contents:
  - "4.1.  IRTF Groups and Network Architecture\n   One interest of the IAB is how\
    \ progress is made on issues of network\n   architecture.  This includes help\
    \ in developing and evaluating new\n   architectures, and in understanding the\
    \ evolving architecture and\n   architectural issues of the decentralized, deployed\
    \ Internet\n   infrastructure.  This also includes developing tools that could\
    \ be\n   used in the above tasks.\n   The spectrum of potential activities for\
    \ IRTF groups ranges from the\n   visionary to the specific, including the following:\n\
    \   * Architecture: Where are we, and where do we go from here?\n   * Incubation:\
    \  We think we know where to go, but we don't yet have\n     the tools to get\
    \ there.\n   * Problem focus: We have some specific problems to solve or potential\n\
    \     solutions to evaluate.\n   Some RGs have addressed broad architectural issues,\
    \ with a mixed set\n   of results;  examples of such RGs include the End-to-End\
    \ Research\n   Group, the NameSpace Research Group, and the Routing Research Group.\n\
    \   For other RGs (e.g., the Host Identity Protocol Research Group), the\n   focus\
    \ of the group is to study a specific proposal, with wider\n   architectural issues\
    \ raised at workshops held by the RG.  Finally,\n   some RGs are in specific areas\
    \ with well-defined boundaries, with\n   topics that don't have broad impact on\
    \ the wider Internet\n   architecture.\n   Where an IRTF RG lies on the spectrum\
    \ of possible activities depends\n   in part on where the IETF and the field itself\
    \ lie.  For example, in\n   areas such as network management where the IETF community\
    \ has doubts\n   or concerns about where we should be going with management\n\
    \   technology, it would be useful for the IETF to be able to look to the\n  \
    \ IRTF for architectural evaluation.  In contrast, in areas where the\n   architectural\
    \ approach is better established, an RG with an\n   incubation approach might\
    \ be more appropriate.  Finally, where many\n   pieces of the puzzle are in place,\
    \ but some significant problems\n   remain, an RG with a problem focus might make\
    \ sense.\n   For those RGs with an architectural focus, it would not be\n   appropriate\
    \ for the IAB to charter an RG to come up with *the*\n   architectural perspective\
    \ on some topic; any such result would\n   necessarily have to pass through the\
    \ wide feedback and consensus\n   procedures of the IETF.  However, it is appropriate\
    \ for the IAB to\n   ask an RG for exploration and discussion of an architectural\
    \ issue;\n   e.g., the IAB has asked the Routing Research Group for feedback about\n\
    \   research objectives for inter-domain routing improvements\n   [IABMinutes].\
    \  It is also possible for RGs to make recommendations on\n   architectural or\
    \ other issues, with or without the request of the\n   IAB; e.g., the End-to-End\
    \ Research Group [RFC2309] and the Crypto\n   Forum Research Group have both made\
    \ recommendations to the general\n   IETF community.  However, some RGs function\
    \ better as a breeding\n   ground for ideas, and not as a consensus-building community.\
    \  For\n   example, while the NameSpace Research Group was \"an invitational\n\
    \   research group chartered exclusively to make a recommendation to the\n   IETF\"\
    \ [NSRG], the group never achieved a clear consensus.\n   While the IAB doesn't\
    \ have clear answers on the evolving role of the\n   IRTF in addressing and understanding\
    \ open architectural issues, this\n   is an area that will be explored in the\
    \ upcoming years, in\n   collaboration with the IRTF Chair.  One of the goals\
    \ of the IAB is to\n   make more use of the IRTF in investigating architectural\
    \ issues.\n"
- title: 4.2.  The Relationship between the IETF and the IRTF
  contents:
  - "4.2.  The Relationship between the IETF and the IRTF\n   Another area that could\
    \ use more attention is making the relationship\n   between the IETF and the IRTF\
    \ more productive.  For many (though not\n   all) of the research groups in the\
    \ IRTF, part of the power of the RG\n   lies in its relationship to the IETF.\
    \  Of current and recent RGs, for\n   example, this is true of the Anti-Spam (ASRG),\
    \ the Crypto Forum\n   (CFRG), Host Identity Protocol (HIP), and a number of others.\n\
    \   The interchange between the IETF and the IRTF could be improved in\n   both\
    \ directions: from the IETF to the IRTF in terms of information\n   about IETF\
    \ problems that could be helped by further research and\n   development, and IETF\
    \ evaluation of RG efforts and direction; and\n   from the IRTF to the IETF in\
    \ terms of reports, documents, proposals,\n   BOFs, and the like.  Current paths\
    \ for this interchange include IRTF\n   reports at IETF plenary meetings; RG meetings\
    \ before or after the\n   IETF, or in one of the scheduled sessions during the\
    \ IETF; workshops;\n   and IRTF documents.\n   One possibility (for some research\
    \ groups, not for all of them) could\n   be for an RG to have a design-team-like\
    \ relationship to the IETF or\n   to an IETF working group, with an RG charter\
    \ that includes an\n   agreement of deliverables, with some notion of the time\
    \ frame for\n   those deliverables.  An issue that would need to be resolved here\
    \ is\n   when is it appropriate for an RG to undertake such a relationship vs.\n\
    \   an IETF WG doing it directly, as is sometimes already done.\n   We note that\
    \ as in WGs, RGs are composed of volunteers who make their\n   own choices of\
    \ research and engineering topics.  RGs are usually\n   started by a proposal\
    \ from individuals who want to form the RG.\n   Thus, it is important to realize\
    \ that IRTF activity often will not be\n   viable in the absence of individuals\
    \ who would like to take on the\n   particular work, and this tempers the usefulness\
    \ of IETF WGs\n   providing input to the IRTF regarding desired IRTF directions\
    \ or\n   activities.  For example, while the IETF can request specific\n   research\
    \ activities from IRTF RGs, results will require individuals\n   within the RGs\
    \ willing to undertake this work.\n   IRTF RGs have been of significant benefit\
    \ to the IETF; a number of\n   IETF proposals began as discussions in the End-to-End\
    \ Research Group,\n   for example.  At the same time, the interchange with RGs\
    \ can take\n   significant time and effort from WG chairs and from ADs, sometimes\n\
    \   with little to show for it if the RG's direction is at odds with that\n  \
    \ desired by the WG chairs or ADs.  One task for the future is to\n   improve\
    \ the dialogue between the IETF and the IRTF while not\n   increasing the load\
    \ on WG chairs and ADs.\n   One role of the IRTF could be to open some new communication\
    \ paths\n   between the research community and the IETF.  Over the last ten\n\
    \   years, as the Internet has grown and matured, and the difficulties of\n  \
    \ making changes to the Internet architecture have increased, the\n   research\
    \ community's participation in the IETF has dropped.  We are\n   not necessarily\
    \ expecting to reverse this trend, but it would be good\n   for the output of\
    \ the research community to reach the IETF somewhat\n   more than it does now,\
    \ and for the research community to hear more\n   from the IETF.\n   We would\
    \ like to shape an IRTF that meets the needs of researchers in\n   this domain,\
    \ providing interaction both with other researchers and\n   with other industry\
    \ technologists.  In this respect, we would like to\n   see an IRTF that has momentum\
    \ that is self-sustaining from voluntary\n   efforts, that undertakes (some) work\
    \ on topics that align to the\n   interests of the IETF, and in such a fashion\
    \ continues to be of\n   material assistance to the IETF standardization effort.\
    \  We would\n   also like to see an IRTF that continues to give thoughtful\n \
    \  consideration and input to the development of the Internet\n   architecture.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Relationships between the Research and Development Communities
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Relationships between the Research and Development Communities\n   One\
    \ of the current and future roles played by the IRTF is that of a\n   bridge between\
    \ the research and development communities; the research\n   community in general\
    \ is less of an active force in the IETF than it\n   was in the beginning of the\
    \ IETF's history.  At the risk of resorting\n   to stereotypes, IETFers sometimes\
    \ view the network research community\n   as irrelevant or disconnected from reality,\
    \ while researchers\n   sometimes view the IETF as insufficiently thoughtful or\
    \ as an\n   unproductive place for investing one's research energies.  There is\n\
    \   also a natural difference in timescales, with the IETF more focused\n   on\
    \ near- to medium-term issues, and researchers often more focused on\n   longer-term\
    \ issues.\n   Unfortunately, disconnections between the research and development\n\
    \   communities can hurt both the research and the development.  Just as\n   one\
    \ example, from \"Failure to Thrive: QoS and the Culture of\n   Operational Networking\"\
    \ [B03]: \"Remarkable intelligence and energy\n   have been lavished upon the\
    \ architectural design of QoS, but much\n   less attention has been devoted to\
    \ careful analysis of the relevant\n   problem space from an operational or economic\
    \ perspective.  This\n   discrepancy is symptomatic of a broken (or attenuated)\
    \ feedback loop\n   between network operations and research.\"  Thus, one potential\
    \ role\n   of the IRTF is to help provide a productive forum that improves the\n\
    \   communication in both directions between the two communities.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.3.1.  What's in a Name:  On the Name `Research Group'\n   There have been proposals\
