Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) protocols: PIM SM (Sparse Mode), BIDIR PIM (Bidirectional), and PIM DM (Dense Mode).
This document is part of work in progress to obsolete RFC 2934, and is to be preferred where the two documents overlap.
This document does not obsolete RFC 2934.
This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) protocols (PIM SM [RFC4601], BIDIR PIM [RFC5015], and PIM DM [RFC3973]).
This document is part of work in progress to obsolete RFC 2934
RFC 2934 defined an experimental MIB module for managing the PIM protocols.
The MIB module defined by this document is a re  working of the MIB module from RFC 2934, with major changes that include the following.
This MIB module is independent of IP version, whereas RFC 2934 only supported IPv4.
This MIB module includes support for managing BIDIR PIM.
This MIB module retains limited support for managing PIM DM [RFC3973], but that is no longer its primary purpose.
This MIB module does not include support for managing PIM SM v1.
This MIB module does not depend on the IPv4 Multicast Routing MIB defined in RFC 2932 [RFC2932].
This MIB module includes support for configuring static Rendezvous Points (RPs).
This MIB module includes support for configuring anycast RPs
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
This MIB module contains the following tables.
The PIM Interface Table, which contains one row per IP version for each interface of the router which is running PIM.
The PIM Neighbor Table, which contains one row for each of the router's PIM neighbors.
The PIM Neighbor Secondary Address Table, which contains one row for each secondary address advertised by each of the router's PIM neighbors.
The PIM ( ,G) State Table, which contains one row for each group for which PIM has ( ,G) state.
State Table, which contains one row for each group and interface for which PIM has interface specific ( ,G) state.
The PIM (S,G) State Table, which contains one row for each source and group for which PIM has (S,G) state.
The PIM (S,G,I) State Table, which contains one row for each source, group, and interface for which PIM has interface  specific (S,G) state.
The PIM (S,G,rpt) State Table, which contains one row for each source and group for which PIM has (S,G,rpt) state.
State Table, which contains one row for each source, group, and interface for which PIM has interface  specific (S,G,rpt) state.
The PIM Bidir DF Election Table, which contains one row per interface for each Rendezvous Point (RP) for which Bidirectional PIM Designated Forwarder (DF) election state is maintained.
The PIM Static RP Table, which contains one row per range of multicast group addresses for which a particular configured RP should be used.
The PIM Group Mapping Table, which contains one row for each mapping from a multicast group address prefix to the PIM mode and RP address to use for groups within that group prefix, regardless of the source of the group mapping information.
The PIM Anycast RP Set Table, which contains one row for each RP within each Anycast RP set of which the local router is a member.
This MIB module uses textual conventions defined in the IF MIB [RFC2863], the INET ADDRESS MIB [RFC4001], and the IANA RTPROTO MIB [RTPROTO].
This MIB module REFERENCEs [RFC3376], [RFC3569], [RFC3618], [RFC3810], [RFC3956], [RFC3973], [RFC4601], [RFC4610], [RFC5015], [RFC5059], and [IPMCAST MIB].

"The number of invalid PIM Register messages that have been received by this device.
A PIM Register message is invalid if either the destination address of the Register message does not match the Group to RP mapping on this device, or this device believes the group address to be within an SSM address range, but this Register implies ASM usage.
These conditions can occur transiently while RP mapping changes propagate through the network.
If this counter is incremented repeatedly over several minutes, then there is a persisting configuration error that requires correction.
The active Group to RP mapping on this device is specified by the object pimGroupMappingPimMode.
If there is no such mapping, then the object pimGroupMappingPimMode is absent.
The RP address contained in the invalid Register is pimInvalidRegisterRp.
Multicast data carried by invalid Register messages is discarded.

The default value of 65535 represents an 'infinite' time, in which case, no pimInvalidJoinPrune notifications are ever sent.
The non zero minimum allowed value provides resilience against propagation of denial of service attacks from the control plane to the network management plane.
The storage type of this object is determined by pimDeviceConfigStorageType.
"The number of invalid PIM Join/Prune messages that have been received by this device.
A PIM Join/Prune message is invalid if either the Group to RP mapping specified by this message does not match the Group to RP mapping on this device, or this device believes the group address to be within an SSM address range, but this Join/Prune ( ,G) or (S,G,rpt) implies ASM usage.
These conditions can occur transiently while RP mapping changes propagate through the network.
If this counter is incremented repeatedly over several minutes, then there is a persisting configuration error that requires correction.
The active Group to RP mapping on this device is specified by the object pimGroupMappingPimMode.
If there is no such mapping, then the object pimGroupMappingPimMode is absent.
The RP address contained in the invalid Join/Prune is pimInvalidJoinPruneRp.
Invalid Join/Prune messages are discarded.
This may result in loss of multicast data affecting listeners downstream of pimInvalidJoinPruneOrigin, for multicast data addressed to pimInvalidJoinPruneGroup.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re initialization of the management system, for example, when the device is rebooted."
"The address type stored in pimInvalidJoinPruneOrigin, pimInvalidJoinPruneGroup, and pimInvalidJoinPruneRp.
If no invalid Join/Prune messages have been received, this object is set to unknown(0)."

The storage type of this object is determined by pimDeviceConfigStorageType.
"The number of changes to active RP mappings on this device.
Information about active RP mappings is available in pimGroupMappingTable.
Only changes to active mappings cause this counter to be incremented.
That is, changes that modify the pimGroupMappingEntry with the highest precedence for a group (lowest value of pimGroupMappingPrecedence).
Such changes may result from manual configuration of this device, or from automatic RP mapping discovery methods including the PIM Bootstrap Router (BSR) mechanism.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re initialization of the management system, for example, when the device is rebooted."
The minimum time that must elapse between
pimInterfaceElection notifications originated by this router.
The default value of 65535 represents an 'infinite' time, in which case, no pimInterfaceElection notifications are ever sent.
The storage type of this object is determined by pimDeviceConfigStorageType.
"The number of times this device has been elected DR or DF on any interface.
Elections occur frequently on newly active interfaces, as triggered Hellos establish adjacencies.
This counter is not incremented for elections on an interface until the first periodic Hello has been sent.
If this router is the DR or DF at the time of sending the first periodic Hello after interface activation, then this counter is incremented (once) at that time.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re initialization of the management system, for example, when the device is rebooted."
"The interval between successive State Refresh messages sent by an Originator.
This timer period is called the RefreshInterval in the PIM DM specification.
This object is used only by PIM DM.
The storage type of this object is determined by pimDeviceConfigStorageType."

"The value this router inserts into the Override Interval field of the LAN Prune Delay option in the PIM Hello messages it sends on this interface.
When overriding a prune, PIM routers pick a random timer duration up to the value of this object.
The more PIM routers that are active on a network, the more likely it is that the prune will be overridden after a small proportion of this time has elapsed.
The more PIM routers are active on this network, the larger this object should be to obtain an optimal spread of prune override latencies.

"Whether this interface is a 'stub interface'.
If this object is set to TRUE, then no PIM packets are sent out this interface, and any received PIM packets are ignored.
Setting this object to TRUE is a security measure for interfaces towards untrusted hosts.
This allows an interface to be configured for use with IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) or MLD (Multicast Listener Discovery) only, which protects the PIM router from forged PIM messages on the interface.
To communicate with other PIM routers using this interface, this object must remain set to FALSE.
Changing the value of this object while the interface is operational causes PIM to be disabled and then re enabled on this interface."

The PIM Group Mapping Table
current DESCRIPTION "The (conceptual) table listing mappings from multicast group prefixes to the PIM mode and RP address to use for groups within that group prefix.
Rows in this table are created for a variety of reasons, indicated by the value of the pimGroupMappingOrigin object.
Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'fixed' are created automatically by the router at startup, to correspond to the well defined prefixes of link local and unroutable group addresses.
These rows are never destroyed.
Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'embedded' are created by the router to correspond to group prefixes that are to be treated as being in Embedded RP format.
Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'configRp' are created and destroyed as a result of rows in the pimStaticRPTable being created and destroyed.
Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'configSsm' are created and destroyed as a result of configuration of SSM address ranges to the local router.
Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'bsr' are created as a result of running the PIM Bootstrap Router (BSR) mechanism.
If the local router is not the elected BSR, these rows are created to correspond to group prefixes in the PIM Bootstrap messages received from the elected BSR.
If the local router is the elected BSR, these rows are created to correspond to group prefixes in the PIM Bootstrap messages that the local router sends.
In either case, these rows are destroyed when the group prefixes are timed out by the BSR mechanism.
Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'other' are created and destroyed according to some other mechanism not specified here.
Given the collection of rows in this table at any point in time, the PIM mode and RP address to use for a particular group is determined using the following algorithm.
From the set of all rows, the subset whose group prefix contains the group in question are selected.
If there are no such rows, then the group mapping is undefined.
If there are multiple selected rows, and a subset is defined by pimStaticRPTable (pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'configRp') with pimStaticRPOverrideDynamic set to TRUE, then this subset is selected.
From the selected subset of rows, the subset that have the greatest value of pimGroupMappingGrpPrefixLength are selected.
If there are still multiple selected rows, the subset that has the highest precedence (the lowest numerical value for pimGroupMappingPrecedence) is selected.
If there are still multiple selected rows, the row selected is implementation dependent; the implementation might or might not apply the PIM hash function to select the row.
The group mode to use is given by the value of pimGroupMappingPimMode from the single selected row; the RP to use is given by the value of pimGroupMappingRPAddress, unless pimGroupMappingOrigin is 'embedded', in which case, the RP is extracted from the group address in question."

Security Considerations There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: The following tables and objects could be employed to modify multicast routing behavior in a way that prevents, disrupts, or subverts services provided by the network, including (but not limited to) multicast data traffic delivery.
For example, attacks can be envisaged that would pass nominated multicast data streams through a nominated location, without the sources or listeners becoming aware of this subversion.

pimStaticRPRowStatus pimStaticRPPrecedence pimAnycastRPSetTable pimAnycastRPSetEntry pimAnycastRPSetAddressType
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: The following tables and objects could be employed to determine the topology, disposition, and composition of the network.
This information may be commercially sensitive, and may also be used in preparation for attacks, including any of the attacks described above.
The following tables and objects may also be used to determine whether multicast data is flowing in the network, or has flowed recently.
They may also be used to determine the network location of senders and recipients.
An attacker can apply 'traffic analysis' to this data.
In some cases, the information revealed by traffic analyses can be as damaging as full knowledge of the data being transported.

There is also a specific danger arising from the notification
This is originated by devices that receive an incorrect unicast encapsulated multicast data packet, which poses a clear danger of propagating a DoS (Denial of Service) attack from the data or control plane to the network management plane.
The following steps are taken to guard against this.
The notification is disabled by default.
The writeable field pimInvalidRegisterNotificationPeriod must be set in order to enable it.
The syntax of pimInvalidRegisterNotificationPeriod prevents any given device from originating the notification more frequently than once every 10 seconds.
The counter pimInvalidRegisterMsgsRcvd provides equivalent function to the notification.
Management applications are encouraged to monitor this counter in preference to enabling the notification.
The same measures are taken in respect of pimInvalidJoinPrune, though as this notification can only arise as a result of unroutable control packets, the risk is not so acute.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
IANA Considerations PIM STD MIB is rooted under the mib 2 subtree.
IANA has assigned { mib 2 157 } to the PIM STD MIB module specified in this document.
