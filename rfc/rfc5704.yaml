  - "Abstract\n   This document identifies problems that may result from the absence\
    \ of\n   formal coordination and joint development on protocols of mutual\n  \
    \ interest between standards development organizations (SDOs).  Some of\n   these\
    \ problems may cause significant harm to the Internet.  The\n   document suggests\
    \ that a robust procedure is required prevent this\n   from occurring in the future.\
    \  The IAB has selected a number of case\n   studies, such as Transport MPLS (T-MPLS),\
    \ as recent examples to\n   describe the hazard to the Internet architecture that\
    \ results from\n   uncoordinated adaptation of a protocol.\n   This experience\
    \ has resulted in a considerable improvement in the\n   relationship between the\
    \ IETF and the ITU-T.  In particular, this was\n   achieved via the establishment\
    \ of the \"Joint working team on\n   MPLS-TP\".  In addition, the leadership of\
    \ the two organizations\n   agreed to improve inter-organizational working practices\
    \ so as to\n   avoid conflict in the future between ITU-T Recommendations and\
    \ IETF\n   RFCs.\n   Whilst we use ITU-T - IETF interactions in these case studies,\
    \ the\n   scope of the document extends to all SDOs that have an overlapping\n\
    \   protocol interest with the IETF.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The uncoordinated adaptation of a protocol, parameter, or\
    \ code-point\n   by a standards development organization (SDO), either through\
    \ the\n   allocation of a code-point without following the formal registration\n\
    \   procedures or by unilaterally modifying the semantics of the protocol\n  \
    \ or intended use of the code-point itself, poses a risk of harm to the\n   Internet\
    \ [RFC4775].\n   The purpose of this document is to describe the various problems\
    \ that\n   may occur without formal coordination and joint development on\n  \
    \ protocols of mutual interest between SDOs.  Some of the problems that\n   arise\
    \ may cause significant harm to the Internet.  In particular, the\n   IAB considers\
    \ it an essential principle of the protocol development\n   process that only\
    \ one SDO maintains design authority for a given\n   protocol, with that SDO having\
    \ ultimate authority over the allocation\n   of protocol parameter code-points\
    \ and over defining the intended\n   semantics, interpretation, and actions associated\
    \ with those code-\n   points.\n   There is currently a joint IETF - ITU-T development\
    \ effort underway,\n   known as the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP), which is\
    \ progressing\n   rapidly to extend MPLS in a way that is consistent with the\
    \ MPLS\n   architecture, and fully satisfies the requirements of the transport\n\
    \   network provider [LS26].  By way of a case study, we will refer to\n   the\
    \ design and standardization process of the ITU-T protocol known as\n   Transport\
    \ MPLS (T-MPLS).  Development of T-MPLS was abandoned\n   [RFC5317] by ITU-T Study\
    \ Group 15 due to inherent conflicts with the\n   IETF MPLS design and, in particular,\
    \ with the Internet architecture.\n   These conflicts arose due to the lack of\
    \ coordination with the IETF\n   as the design authority for MPLS.\n   The goal\
    \ of this document is to demonstrate the importance of a\n   coordinated approach\
    \ to successful collaboration between SDOs, and to\n   explain a model for inter-SDO\
    \ collaborative protocol development that\n   is being used successfully by the\
    \ ITU-T and IETF.\n"
- title: 2.  Protocol Design Rules
  contents:
  - "2.  Protocol Design Rules\n   This section describes a number of protocol design\
    \ rules needed to\n   ensure the safe operation of a network.  Whilst these rules\
    \ will be\n   familiar to many protocol designers, the rules are restated here\
    \ to\n   ensure that assumptions are clear and consistent.  Differing\n   assumptions\
    \ have been at the root of many miscoordinations and\n   miscommunications between\
    \ SDOs in the past.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Protocol Safety
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Protocol Safety\n   To understand the reasons why the IAB and IETF regard\
    \ uncoordinated\n   use of code-points and/or protocol modification as posing\
    \ a risk of\n   harm to the Internet, it is necessary to recap some important\n\
    \   principles of protocol design in large-scale networks such as the\n   Internet.\
    \  Many end users and businesses have come to rely on the\n   Internet as part\
    \ of their critical infrastructure, thus large-scale\n   networks, such as the\
    \ Internet, represent significant economic value.\n   Any outage in a large-scale\
    \ network due to a protocol failure will\n   therefore result in significant commercial\
    \ and political damage.\n   When two incompatible protocols, or forms of the same\
    \ protocol, are\n   deployed without coordination, there is a serious risk that\
    \ this may\n   be catastrophic to the stability or security of the network.\n\
    \   Furthermore, the scale and distributed nature of the Internet is such\n  \
    \ that it may be difficult or impossible to rid the network of the\n   long-term\
    \ consequences of the protocol incompatibility.  Therefore,\n   the following\
    \ issues are of critical importance.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Importance of Invariants
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Importance of Invariants\n   Invariants are core properties that are consistent\
    \ across the network\n   and do not change over extremely long time-scales.  Protocol\n\
    \   designers use such invariants as axioms in designing protocols.  A\n   protocol\
    \ often places an absolute reliance on an invariant to resolve\n   a design corner\
    \ case.  One example of an invariance in IP that was\n   inherited in the design\
    \ of MPLS is the invariant that a time to live\n   (TTL) value is monotonically\
    \ decreased and that a packet with TTL<=1\n   will not be forwarded.  This is\
    \ a safety mechanism to mitigate the\n   damaging effects of packet-forwarding\
    \ loops.  Another example is the\n   way that MPLS applies special semantics to\
    \ the reserved label set\n   (0..15) [RFC3032], and the notion that a Label Switched\
    \ Router (LSR)\n   is free to allocate labels with a value of 16 or greater for\
    \ its own\n   use.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Importance of Correct Identification
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Importance of Correct Identification\n   A special type of invariant is\
    \ the allocation of a code-point.  A\n   code-point may be used to identify a\
    \ packet type or a component\n   within a packet.  Without these identifiers,\
    \ a packet is an opaque\n   sequence of bits.  A packet parser operates by first\
    \ identifying the\n   code-point and then using the semantics associated with\
    \ that code-\n   point to interpret other components within the packet.  Once\
    \ a code-\n   point is defined, the interpretation of associated data and the\n\
    \   consequential actions become protocol invariants.  Subsequent\n   protocol\
    \ development must adhere to those invariants.  The semantics\n   for an allocated\
    \ code-point must never change.  If a future\n   enhancement requires different\
    \ semantics, interpretation, or action,\n   then a new code-point must be obtained.\n"
- title: 2.4.  The Role of the Design Authority
  contents:
  - "2.4.  The Role of the Design Authority\n   A code-point such as an IEEE Ethertype\
    \ is allocated to a design\n   authority such as the IETF.  It is this design\
    \ authority that\n   establishes how information identified by the code-point\
    \ is to be\n   interpreted to associate appropriate invariants.  Modification\
    \ and\n   extension of a protocol requires great care.  In particular, it is\n\
    \   necessary to understand the exact nature of the invariants and the\n   consequences\
    \ of modification.  Such understanding may not always be\n   possible when protocols\
    \ are modified by organizations that don't have\n   the experience of the original\
    \ designers or the design authority\n   expert pool.  Furthermore, since there\
    \ can only safely be a single\n   interpretation of the information identified\
    \ by a code-point, there\n   must be a unique authority responsible for authorizing\
    \ and\n   documenting the semantics of the information and consequential\n   protocol\
    \ actions.\n   In the case of IP and MPLS technologies, the design authority is\
    \ the\n   IETF.  The IETF has an internal process for evolving and maintaining\n\
    \   the protocols for which it is the design authority.  The IETF also\n   has\
    \ change processes in place [RFC4929] to work with other SDOs that\n   require\
    \ enhancements to its protocols and architectures.  Similarly,\n   the ITU-T has\
    \ design authority for Recommendation E.164 [E.164] and\n   allocates the relevant\
    \ code-points, even though the IETF has design\n   authority for the protocols\
    \ (\"ENUM\") used to access E.164 numbers\n   through the Internet DNS [RFC3245].\n\
    \   It is a recommendation of this document that the IETF introduces\n   additional\
    \ change mechanisms to encompass all of the technical areas\n   for which it has\
    \ design authority.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Ships in the Night
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Ships in the Night\n   It may be tempting for a designer to assert that\
    \ the protocol\n   extensions it proposes are safe even though it breaks the invariants\n\
    \   of the original protocol because these protocol variants will operate\n  \
    \ as ships in the night.  That is, these protocol variants will never\n   simultaneously\
    \ exist in the same network domain and will never need\n   to inter-work.  This\
    \ is a fundamentally unsound assumption for a\n   number of reasons.  First, it\
    \ is infeasible to ensure that the two\n   instances will never be interconnected\
    \ under any circumstances.\n   Second, even if the operators that deploy the protocols\
    \ apply\n   appropriate due diligence to ensure that the two instances do not\n\
    \   conflict, it is infeasible to ensure that such conflicting protocols\n   will\
    \ not be interconnected under fault conditions.\n   This assumption of ships in\
    \ the night is particularly hazardous when\n   the instances of the protocol share\
    \ the same identifying code-point.\n   This is because a system is unable to determine\
    \ which variant of the\n   protocol it has received, and hence how to correctly\
    \ interpret the\n   associated information or to determine what protocol actions\
    \ may be\n   safely executed.\n"
- title: 3.  Examples of Miscoordination
  contents:
  - "3.  Examples of Miscoordination\n   There are a variety of examples where lack\
    \ of inter-SDO coordination\n   has led to the publication of flawed protocol\
    \ designs.  This section\n   describes a number of case studies that illustrate\
    \ coordination\n   issues.\n"
- title: 3.1.  T-MPLS as a Case Study
  contents:
  - "3.1.  T-MPLS as a Case Study\n   A recent example where another SDO created a\
    \ protocol based on\n   misunderstandings of IETF protocols is T-MPLS.  T-MPLS\
    \ was created in\n   ITU-T in an attempt to design a packet-transport method for\n\
    \   transport-oriented networks.  This is an example of the success that\n   IETF\
    \ protocols have enjoyed, and ITU-T's interest and selection of\n   MPLS is a\
    \ compliment to the IETF work.  Quite late in the ITU-T\n   design and specification\
    \ cycle, there were a number of liaison\n   exchanges between the ITU-T and the\
    \ IETF, where the IETF became\n   increasingly concerned about incompatibility\
    \ of IETF MPLS procedures\n   and technologies with ITU-T T-MPLS [RFC5317].  Extensive\
    \ discussions\n   took place regarding interpretation, definition, and\n   misunderstandings\
    \ regarding aspects such as MPLS Label 14, MPLS swap\n   operation, TTL semantics,\
    \ reservation of additional labels, and EXP\n   bits.  If ITU-T had worked with\
    \ IETF from the start in developing\n   T-MPLS, these problems could have been\
    \ avoided.  A detailed analysis\n   of the T-MPLS case is provided in Appendix\
    \ A.\n"
- title: 3.2.  PPP over SONET/SDH (Synchronous Optical Network / Synchronous
  contents:
  - "3.2.  PPP over SONET/SDH (Synchronous Optical Network / Synchronous\n      Digital\
    \ Hierarchy)\n   An example of where the IETF failed to coordinate with the ITU-T\
    \ is\n   [RFC1619], which defined PPP over SONET.  In the text dealing with\n\
    \   the SONET/SDH Synchronous Payload Envelope (SPE), the document\n   erroneously\
    \ stated that \"no scrambling is needed during insertion\n   into the SPE.\" \
    \ It was later determined by SONET experts operating in\n   the ITU-T and in ANSI\
    \ that this error arose due to an incomplete\n   understanding of the SONET scrambler.\
    \  By not using a scrambler, the\n   protocol was attempting to transport non-transparent\
    \ data over SONET.\n   This resulted in lost or misinterpreted data in the Packet\
    \ over SONET\n   (PoS) network.  This impacted routing, signaling, and end-user\
    \ data\n   traffic.  Details of this work are described in [PPPoSONET].  This\n\
    \   problem would have been prevented if the IETF had worked with ITU-T\n   and\
    \ ANSI in initially developing [RFC1619] .  The problem was\n   resolved by working\
    \ jointly with ITU-T and ANSI experts to publish\n   [RFC2615], which mandated\
    \ the use of scrambling.\n   Note that [RFC1619] was developed four years before\
    \ the IETF and\n   ITU-T agreed on formal procedures for cooperation, as documented\
    \ in\n   [RFC2436] (which was later obsoleted by [RFC3356]).\n"

  contents:
  - "5.  MPLS-TP as Best Practice\n   In order to bridge the gap between the two organizations,\
    \ the IETF\n   and the ITU-T established a joint working team (JWT) to assess\n\
    \   whether it was possible to enhance existing MPLS standards to provide\n  \
    \ a best-in-class solution for transport networks.  The outcome of this\n   investigation\
    \ is reported in [RFC5317].\n   The JWT proposed a design that was acceptable\
    \ to both SDOs.  This has\n   led to the creation of the MPLS-TP project.  This\
    \ is a joint project\n   in which the ITU-T experts work with the IETF on protocol-development\n\
    \   tasks, and IETF members work within the ITU-T to understand\n   requirements\
    \ and to assist in the creation of ITU-T recommendations\n   that describe MPLS-TP\
    \ in which the technical definition is provided\n   through normative references\
    \ to IETF RFCs.\n   Although the JWT approach allowed the IETF and the ITU-T to\
    \ agree on\n   a method of resolving the T-MPLS problem, this approach had a\n\
    \   significant resource cost.  The JWT required considerable protocol-\n   design\
    \ expertise and IETF management time to agree on a suitable\n   technical solution.\
    \  A lightweight process, starting with close\n   coordination during the requirements\

  - "10.  Emerging Issues\n   Although we have used T-MPLS as a case study, there\
    \ are other ongoing\n   ITU-T projects and core IETF specifications that could\
    \ be the subject\n   of either improved coordination or new conflicts, depending\
    \ on\n   whether or not the principles outlined in this document are adhered\n\
    \   to by the IETF and ITU.  Two current examples are [Y.2015] and\n   [Q.Flowsig].\
    \  New areas with potential for cooperation or conflict\n   are emerging from\
    \ the work of ITU-T SG13 Question 7, \"IPv6\" -- for\n   example: [Y.ipv6split]\
    \ and [Y.ipv6migration].\n   Improved coordination, of course, is not limited\
    \ to the relationship\n   between IETF and ITU-T.  This issue is present between\
    \ a set of SDOs.\n   The IETF - ITU-T relationship has simply been used because\
    \ there is a\n   recent example where a potential disaster was, through much hard\n\
    \   work, not only prevented but turned into a net gain for all.\n"

    \ significant problems with potentially damaging operation\n   impact to those\
    \ that deploy and use the Internet.  Both inter- and\n   intra-SDO information\
    \ flow needs to be well managed to ensure that\n   all impacted parties are aware\
    \ of work items.  Finally, the IETF\n   needs to develop a universal change process\

- title: A.1.  Multiple Definitions of Label 14
  contents:
  - "A.1.  Multiple Definitions of Label 14\n   To appreciate why the use of MPLS\
    \ Reserved Label 14 by the T-MPLS\n   protocol represented a safety concern to\
    \ the Internet, it is\n   important to understand the current standards that use\
    \ MPLS Reserved\n   Label 14.\n   The governing standard on the use of MPLS Reserved\
    \ Label 14 is\n   [RFC3429], \"Assignment of the 'OAM Alert Label' for Multiprotocol\n\
    \   Label Switching Architecture (MPLS) Operation and Maintenance (OAM)\n   Functions\"\
    .\n   Label 14 is assigned to a specific protocol, namely, ITU-T\n   Recommendation\
    \ [Y.1711-2002].\n   ITU-T Recommendation [Y.1711-2002] has been superseded by\
    \ newer\n   versions, specifically: [Y.1711-2004], [Y.1711cor1], and [Y.1711am1].\n\
    \   All three documents are currently in force as ITU-T Recommendations.\n   The\
    \ problem is that the changes made to Y.1711 were never reflected\n   in an update\
    \ to RFC 3429, which only defines the protocol as\n   specified by the now superseded\
    \ 2002 Recommendation.  So for example,\n   MPLS equipment responding to an MPLS\
    \ packet containing Label 14 would\n   expect to see the 2002 version of the Y.1711\
    \ [Y.1711-2002] protocol\n   and would not recognize any of the new function codes\
    \ specified in\n   Y.1711 Amendment 1.  This problem arises because Y.1711 does\
    \ not have\n   a version field, and RFC 3429 offers no other method to disambiguate\n\
    \   non-interoperable versions of Y.1711.  Having a version number in the\n  \
    \ protocol permits an implementer to codify non-interoperability.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ the IETF as the authority over Label 14 semantics has\n   the final say over\
    \ maintaining the interoperability of the protocol\n   employing that code-point,\
    \ unless the IETF explicitly delegates such\n   authority.\n   With regard to\
    \ T-MPLS, there was a lack of coordination between the\n   ITU-T and the IETF\
    \ over the redefinition of the semantics of MPLS\n   Label 14, which resulted\
    \ in protocol definitions that conflicted with\n   the IETF MPLS architecture.\n\
    \   The MPLS architecture [RFC3031], defines a swap operation as an\n   atomic\
    \ function that replaces the top label in an MPLS label stack\n   with another\
    \ label, which provides context for the next hop LSR.\n   However, the ITU-T Recommendations\
    \ that specified the new OAM\n   functions defined by Label 14 redefined the label-swap\
    \ operation as a\n   POP, followed by a PUSH, thereby causing all LSRs to inspect\
    \ the\n   label stack for the presence of Label 14 at each hop.  This proposed\n\
    \   new behaviour conflicts with the IETF definition of a swap operation.\n  \
    \ The behaviour proposed in these specifications would have had major\n   consequences\
    \ for deployed hardware designs.  The outcome would have\n   been that the equipments\
    \ built according to the two different\n   specifications would have been incompatible.\
    \  It is important that\n   the atomic procedure defined in [RFC3031] is kept\
    \ unchanged.\n"
- title: A.2.  Redefinition of TTL Semantics
  contents:
  - "A.2.  Redefinition of TTL Semantics\n   The standard method of delivering an\
    \ OAM message to an entity on a\n   Label Switched Path (LSP), such that the OAM\
    \ message shares its fate\n   with the data traffic, is to use TTL expiry.  The\
    \ IETF's Internet\n   Protocol (IP) utilizes this mechanism for traceroute [RFC1393],\
    \ as\n   does MPLS ping [RFC4379].\n   At one stage, the T-MPLS designers considered\
    \ a multi-level OAM\n   design in which the OAM packet was steered to its target\
    \ by a process\n   in which some nodes increased the TTL as they forwarded the\
    \ OAM\n   packet to its next hop.  TTL is a safety device in the IETF IP and\n\
    \   MPLS architecture that prevents a packet from continuously looping\n   under\
    \ fault conditions.  Thus, the proposed extension to support an\n   enhanced OAM\
    \ mechanism violated an MPLS design invariant specifically\n   introduced to ensure\
    \ safe operation of the Internet by preventing\n   persistent forwarding loops.\n"
- title: A.3.  Reservation of Additional Labels
  contents:
  - "A.3.  Reservation of Additional Labels\n   The IETF MPLS protocol uses a small\
    \ number of reserved labels\n   [RFC3032] as a mechanism to provide additional\
    \ context and to trigger\n   some special processing operations in the forwarder.\
    \  All other\n   labels used for forwarding use semantics defined by the forwarding\n\
    \   equivalence class (FEC).  In an early implementation of T-MPLS, the\n   designers\
    \ determined that they needed some additional labels to alert\n   the forwarder\
    \ that the packet needed special processing.  Thus, a\n   conflict was thereby\
    \ introduced between the behaviour of an IETF MPLS\n   LSR and LSRs that operate\
    \ according to the specification in the ITU-T\n   Recommendation.  Thus, some\
    \ LSRs would attribute special semantics to\n   Labels 16..31, whilst other LSRs\
    \ would perform normal forwarding on\n   them.\n"
- title: A.4.  Redefinition of MPLS EXP Bits
  contents:
  - "A.4.  Redefinition of MPLS EXP Bits\n   The early MPLS documents defined the\
    \ form of the MPLS label stack\n   entry [RFC3032].  This includes a three-bit\
    \ field called the \"EXP\n   field\".  The exact use of this field was not defined\
    \ by these\n   documents, except to state that it was to be \"reserved for\n \
    \  experimental use\".\n   Although the intended use of the EXP field was as a\
    \ \"Class of\n   Service\" (CoS) field, it was not named a CoS field by these\
    \ early\n   documents because the use of such a CoS field was not considered to\n\
    \   be sufficiently defined.  Today, a number of standards documents\n   define\
    \ its usage as a CoS field ([RFC3270], [RFC5129]), and hardware\n   is deployed\
    \ that assumes this exclusive usage.\n   The T-MPLS designers, unaware of the\
    \ historic reason for the\n   \"provisional\" naming of this field, assumed that\
    \ they were available\n   for any experimental use and re-purposed them to indicate\
    \ the\n   maintenance-entity level (a hierarchical maintenance mechanism).\n \
    \  The intended use of the EXP field was subsequently carried in\n   [RFC5462],\
    \ which reinforces this use by formally changing the name to\n   Traffic Class\
    \ (TC).\n"

  - "A.5.  The Consequences for the Network Operators\n   Transport network operators\
    \ need a way to realize the statistical\n   gain inherent in packet networking\
    \ while retaining the familiar\n   operational structure of their SONET/SDH networks.\
    \  T-MPLS was an\n   attempt to provide that functionality.  However, creating\
    \ an\n   incompatible variant of MPLS without tight coordination with IETF\n \
    \  created a number of problems for network operators.\n   Firstly, those operators\
    \ that deployed T-MPLS in production networks\n   will need to address the risk\
    \ and complexity of transitioning their\n   network to MPLS-TP.  Secondly, there\
    \ has been a consequential delay\n   of the necessary enhancements to MPLS to\
    \ meet their needs [RFC5654]\n   as the IETF and ITU-T executed a redevelopment\
    \ of MPLS-based\n   transport network protocols.\n   Fortunately, the two organizations\
    \ are now working together to design\n   the necessary enhancements\n   The resulting\
    \ technology, MPLS-TP, brings significant benefits to\n   all.  However, this\
    \ has not been without cost.  Had things continued,\n   we are not sure what would\
    \ have happened -- at the least, the larger\n   MPLS community would have been\
    \ denied the benefit of better OAM, and\n   the transport community would have\
