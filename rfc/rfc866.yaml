  - "                              Active Users\nThis RFC specifies a standard for
    the ARPA Internet community.  Hosts on\nthe ARPA Internet that choose to implement
    an Active Users Protocol are\nexpected to adopt and implement this standard.\nA
    useful debugging and measurement tool is an active users service.  An\nactive
    users service simply sends a list of the currently active users\non the host without
    regard to the input.\nAn active user is one logged in, such as listed in SYSTAT
    or WHO.\nTCP Based Active Users Service\n   One active users service is defined
    as a connection based application\n   on TCP.  A server listens for TCP connections
    on TCP port 11.  Once a\n   connection is established a list of the currently
    active users is\n   sent out the connection (and any data received is thrown away).
    \ The\n   service closes the connection after sending the list.\nUDP Based Active
    Users Service\n   Another active users service service is defined as a datagram
    based\n   application on UDP.  A server listens for UDP datagrams on UDP port\n
    \  11.  When a datagram is received, an answering datagram is sent\n   containing
    a list of the currently active users (the data in the\n   received datagram is
    ignored).\n   If the list does not fit in one datagram then send a sequence of\n
    \  datagrams but don't break the information for a user (a line) across\n   a
    datagram.  The user side should wait for a timeout for all\n   datagrams to arrive.
    \ Note that they are not necessarily in order.\nUser List Syntax\n   There is
    no specific syntax for the user list.  It is recommended\n   that it be limited
    to the ASCII printing characters, space, carriage\n   return, and line feed.  Each
    user should be listed on a separate\n   line.\n"
