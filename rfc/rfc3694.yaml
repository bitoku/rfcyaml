  - "1.  Introduction\n   The proliferation of location-based services that integrate\
    \ tracking\n   and navigation capabilities gives rise to significant privacy and\n\
    \   security concerns.  Such services allow users to identify their own\n   location\
    \ as well as determine the location of others.  In certain\n   peer-to-peer exchanges,\
    \ device identification takes place\n   automatically within a defined location\
    \ perimeter, informing peer\n   devices of a given user's identity and availability.\
    \  Additionally,\n   records of location exchanges can reveal significant information\n\
    \   about the habits, whereabouts, and associations of individual users.\n   The\
    \ Geopriv requirements allow the Location Object (LO) to support a\n   wide variety\
    \ of uses of Location Information (LI); the Geopriv object\n   itself is intended\
    \ to be technology-neutral, allowing a wide variety\n   of devices to provide\
    \ LI in the form of an LO.  Geopriv also requires\n   that many classes of Viewers\
    \ be capable of requesting LI from a\n   Location Server.  The Geopriv requirements\
    \ account for circumstances\n   in which the Target has a contractual relationship\
    \ with the entities\n   that transmit and receive LI and those in which no contract\
    \ exists.\n   Requiring the Geopriv object to support any technology, Target-Viewer\n\
    \   relationship, or underlying legal framework governing LI, complicates\n  \
    \ the protection of privacy and the security of LI.\n   This document analyzes\
    \ threats to LI in transmission and storage.\n   The possibility that the LI will\
    \ be compromised by these threats\n   varies depending on the circumstances. \
    \ A server selling location\n   information to potential marketers poses a distinctly\
    \ lower risk than\n   an outside individual intercepting a Target's present location\
    \ to\n   commit a physical attack.  It is important that these threats are\n \
    \  considered as we work towards defining the LO.\n   Some of the threats discussed\
    \ in this document may be outside the\n   scope of the Geopriv charter, e.g.,\
    \ threats arising from failure to\n   meet contractual obligations.  Nevertheless,\
    \ a comprehensive\n   discussion of threats is necessary to identify desirable\
    \ security\n   properties and counter-measures that will improve the security\
    \ of the\n   LO, and thereby better protect LI.\n"

  - "2.  Habitat of the Geopriv Protocol\n   The Geopriv architecture will be deployed\
    \ in the open Internet - in a\n   security environment in which potential attackers\
    \ can inspect packets\n   on the wire, spoof Internet addresses, and launch large-scale\n\
    \   denial-of-service attacks.  In some architectures, portions of\n   Geopriv\
    \ traffic (especially traffic between the Location Generator\n   and an initial\
    \ Location Server) may occur over managed networks that\n   do not interface with\
    \ the public Internet.\n   The protocol itself assumes interaction between a number\
    \ of logical\n   roles, many of which will commonly be implemented in distributed\n\
    \   network devices (for a full list of Geopriv roles and entities with\n   definitions,\
    \ see [1]).  The endpoints of the common Geopriv\n   transactions are the Location\
    \ Generator (the source of location\n   information from the perspective of the\
    \ network) and the Location\n   Recipient.  Both a Location Generator and a Location\
    \ Recipient may\n   have a relationship with a Location Server; the Location Generator\n\
    \   publishes data to a Location Server (which may provide a grooming/\n   filtration\
    \ function for location information), and the Location\n   Recipient requests\
    \ and/or receives information from the Location\n   Server.  This provides two\
    \ points where Geopriv information could\n   require protection across the wire.\
    \  Rules can also be passed over\n   the network from a Rule Holder to a Location\
    \ Server; this provides\n   another point where the architecture requires security.\n\
    \   It is important to note that Location Generators and Location\n   Recipients\
    \ may be implemented on low-cost devices for which strong\n   cryptographic security\
    \ is currently prohibitively expensive\n   computationally.\n"
- title: 3.  Motivations of Attackers of Geopriv
  contents:
  - "3.  Motivations of Attackers of Geopriv\n   The most obvious motivation for an\
    \ attacker of Geopriv is to learn\n   the location of a subject who wishes to\
    \ keep their position private,\n   or even for authorized Viewers to ascertain\
    \ location information with\n   a greater degree of precision than the Rule Maker\
    \ desires.  However,\n   there are several other potential motivations that cause\
    \ concern.\n   Attackers might also wish to prevent a Target's location from being\n\
    \   distributed, or to modify or corrupt location information in order to\n  \
    \ misrepresent the location of the Target, or to redirect the Target's\n   location\
    \ information to a third party that is not authorized to know\n   this information.\
    \  Attackers may want to identify the associates of a\n   Target, or learn the\
    \ habit or routines of a Target.  Attackers might\n   want to learn the identity\
    \ of all of the parties that are in a\n   certain location.  Finally, some attackers\
    \ may simply want to halt\n   the operation of an entire Geopriv system through\
    \ denial-of-service\n   attacks.\n   There is also a class of attackers who may\
    \ be authorized as\n   legitimate participants in a Geopriv protocol exchange\
    \ but who abuse\n   location information.  This includes the distribution or accumulation\n\
    \   of location information outside the parameters of agreements between\n   the\
    \ principals, possibly for commercial purposes or as an act of\n   unlawful surveillance.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  Eavesdropping and/or Interception\n   Imagine a location-based computer\
    \ game, based on traditional hide-\n   and-seek, in which a centralized server\
    \ provides hints as to the\n   location of the 'hider' to a set of 'seekers'.\
    \  Seekers are given\n   access to very coarse location data, whereas a single\
    \ referee is\n   given access to unfiltered and precise location information of\
    \ the\n   hider.  Each seeker has a wireless device (in the Geopriv\n   architecture,\
    \ a Location Recipient) that feeds them coarse\n   positioning data from the Location\
    \ Server.  The hider carries a\n   device (a Location Generator employing GPS)\
    \ that transmits location\n   information to the Location Server.\n   If one of\
    \ the seekers wished to cheat by attacking the Geopriv\n   protocol, there are\
    \ a number of ways they could mount such an attack\n   in order to learn the precise\
    \ location of the hider.  They might\n   eavesdrop on one of two network connections\
    \ - either the connection\n   between the Location Generator and the Location\
    \ Server, or the\n   connection between the Location Server and the referee's\
    \ Location\n   Recipient (which receives precise information).  They might also\n\
    \   attempt to impersonate the referee to the Location Server, in order\n   to\
    \ receive unfiltered Location Information.  Alternatively, they\n   could impersonate\
    \ the Location Server to the Location Generator\n   carried by the hider, which\
    \ would also give them access to precise\n   location information.  Finally, the\
    \ cheater could attempt to act as\n   the Rule Maker, whereby providing Rules\
    \ to the Location Server would\n   enable the cheater's Location Recipient access\
    \ to uncoarsened\n   location information.\n   From these threats, we can derive\
    \ a need for several security\n   properties of the architecture.\n   o  Confidentiality\
    \ is required on both the connection between the\n      Location Generator and\
    \ the Location Server, as well as the\n      connection between the Location Server\
    \ and any given Location\n      Recipient.\n   o  Location Servers must be capable\
    \ of authenticating and authorizing\n      Location Recipients to prevent impersonation.\n\
    \   o  Similarly, Location Generators must be capable of authenticating\n    \
    \  and authorizing Location Servers in order to prevent\n      impersonation.\n\
    \   o  Finally, the Location Server must be able to authenticate Rule\n      Makers,\
    \ to make sure that unauthorized parties cannot change\n      rules.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.  Identity Spoofing
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  Identity Spoofing\n   Consider a case in which the same boss employs\
    \ two rivals.  One goes\n   on a business trip to Cleveland.  Both rivals carry\
    \ devices that are\n   tracked by a Location Generator (such as cell phones which\
    \ the cell\n   carrier can triangulate), and both rivals allow their boss access\
    \ to\n   their (coarse) location information.  The rival that remained home\n\
    \   wants to hack the Geopriv protocol to make it appear that the\n   traveling\
    \ rival is actually goofing off in South Beach rather than\n   attending a dull\
    \ technology conference in Cleveland.  How would such\n   an attack be mounted?\n\
    \   The attacker might attempt to spoof network traffic from the Location\n  \
    \ Generator to the Location Server (especially if, through some other\n   means\
    \ such as a denial-of-service attack, the Location Generator\n   became unable\
    \ to issue its own reports).  The goal of the attacker\n   may be to provide falsified\
    \ location information appropriate for\n   someone in Miami, or perhaps even to\
    \ replay a genuine location object\n   from a previous visit of the rival to Miami.\
    \  The attacker might also\n   try to spoof traffic from the Location Server to\
    \ the boss' Location\n   Recipient.\n   From these threats we can derive a need\
    \ for several security\n   properties of the architecture.\n   o  There is a need\
    \ for the Location Server to authenticate Location\n      Generators.\n   o  Location\
    \ Recipients must be capable of authenticating Location\n      Servers.\n   o\
    \  Location information must be protected from replay attacks.\n   Identity spoofing\
    \ may create additional threats when the protocol is\n   attacked.  In many circumstances,\
    \ the identity of the Viewer is the\n   basis for controlling whether LI is revealed\
    \ and, if so, how that LI\n   is filtered.  If the identity of that entity is\
    \ compromised, privacy\n   is threatened.  Anyone inside or outside the transaction\
    \ that is\n   capable of impersonating an authorized entity can gain access to\n\
    \   confidential information, or initiate false transmissions in the\n   authorized\
    \ entity's name.  The ability to spoof the identity of the\n   Location Recipient,\
    \ for example, would create the risk of an\n   unauthorized entity accessing both\
    \ the identity and the location of\n   the Target at the moment the LO was sent.\n"
- title: 4.1.3.  Information Gathering
  contents:
  - "4.1.3.  Information Gathering\n   Eavesdropping and interception can also create\
    \ traffic analysis\n   threats as the interceptor collects more data over time.\
    \  Traffic\n   analysis threats are leveraged by an eavesdropper to determine,\
    \ from\n   the very fact of a network transmission, the relationship between the\n\
    \   various entities involved.  If an employer sends the location of an\n   employee\
    \ to a customer, an eavesdropper could determine that these\n   three entities\
    \ are somehow interacting with one another.  If\n   eavesdropping continues over\
    \ time, the collection of interactions\n   would involve the employer, employees,\
    \ and all of their customers.\n   Such a log of information would reveal that\
    \ the employer and employee\n   frequently were associated with one another, and\
    \ would reveal which\n   clients more frequently dealt with the pair.  Thus, the\
    \ traffic\n   analysis threat creates the risk of eavesdroppers determining the\n\
    \   Target's associates.\n   Traffic analysis might also allow an eavesdropper\
    \ to ascertain the\n   identity or characteristics of targets in a particular\
    \ location.  By\n   observing transmissions between Location Generators in a particular\n\
    \   location and Location Servers (perhaps by eavesdropping on a wireless\n  \
    \ or wireline LAN scoped to the location in question), and then\n   possibly following\
    \ the data to various Location Recipients, an\n   attacker may be able to learn\
    \ the associates, including the employer,\n   of targets in that location, and\
    \ perhaps to extrapolate further\n   identity information.\n   If the eavesdropper\
    \ is able to intercept not only an encrypted LO,\n   but the plaintext LI itself,\
    \ other threats are raised.  Let's return\n   to the above example of the employer\
    \ requesting an employee's\n   location information.  In this instance, the interception\
    \ of one such\n   past transaction may reveal the identities and/or locations\
    \ of all\n   three parties involved, in addition to revealing their association.\n\
    \   In circumstances where there is a log of this data, however, analysis\n  \
    \ could reveal any regular route that the employee may travel in\n   visiting\
    \ customers, a general area that the employee works in, the\n   identities and\
    \ location of the employee's entire customer base, and\n   information about how\
    \ the entities relate.\n   Threats based on traffic analysis are difficult to\
    \ meet with protocol\n   security measures, but they are important to note.\n\
    \   From these threats we can derive a need for several security\n   properties\
    \ of the architecture.\n   o  The Rule Maker must be able to define Rules regarding\
    \ the use of\n      their LI.\n   o  The connection between the Location Generator\
    \ and Location Server,\n      as well as the connection between the Location Server\
    \ and Location\n      Recipient must remain confidential.\n   o  Location Servers\
    \ must be capable of authenticating Location\n      Recipients to prevent impersonation.\n\
    \   o  Location Servers must be able to authenticate Rule Makers to\n      ensure\
    \ that unauthorized entities cannot change rules.\n"
- title: 4.1.4.  Denial of Service
  contents:
  - "4.1.4.  Denial of Service\n   Parties who wish to deprive entire networks of\
    \ Geopriv service,\n   rather than just targeting particular users, would probably\
    \ focus\n   their efforts on the Location Server.  Since in many scenarios the\n\
    \   Location Server plays the central role of managing access to location\n  \
    \ information for many devices, it is in such architectures a natural\n   single\
    \ point of failure.\n   The Geopriv protocol appears to have some opportunities\
    \ for\n   amplification attacks.  When the Location Generator publishes\n   location\
    \ information, the Location Server acts as an exploder,\n   potentially delivering\
    \ this information to numerous targets.  If the\n   Location Generator were to\
    \ provide very rapid updates of position (as\n   many as link speed could accommodate,\
    \ especially in high-bandwidth\n   wireless environments), then were the Location\
    \ Server to proxy\n   information to Seekers at a similar rate, this could become\n\
    \   problematic when large numbers of Seekers are tracking the same user.\n  \
    \ Also note that most operations associated with the Location Server\n   probably\
    \ require cryptographic authentication.  Cryptographic\n   operations entail a\
    \ computational expense on the part of the Location\n   Server.  This could provide\
    \ an attractive means for attackers to\n   flood the Location Server with dummied\
    \ Geopriv information that is\n   spoofed to appear to come from a Location Generator,\
    \ Location\n   Recipient, or the Rule Maker.  Because the Location Server has\
    \ to\n   expend resources to verify credentials presented by these Geopriv\n \
    \  messages, floods of Geopriv information could have greater impact\n   than\
    \ denial-of-service attacks based on generic packet flooding.\n   From these threats\
    \ we can derive a need for several security\n   properties of the architecture.\n\
    \   o  Location Servers must use stateless authentication challenges and\n   \
    \   similar measures to ensure that authentication attempts will not\n      unnecessarily\
    \ consume system resources.\n   o  The Rule Maker must be able to provision policies\

  - "4.2.1.  Data Stored at Servers\n   LI maintained at a server is subject to many\
    \ potential risks.  First,\n   there may be accidental misuse of LI by the server.\
    \  Whether by\n   negligence, carelessness, or lack of knowledge, the server may\n\
    \   accidentally release LI to the wrong Location Recipients, or fail to\n   properly\
    \ filter the LI that is sent out.  Second, the server may\n   intentionally misuse\
    \ LI.  A server may decide to sell a \"profile\" it\n   has compiled of a Target\
    \ or Location Recipient despite provisions to\n   the contrary in the Rule Maker's\
    \ Rule.  Alternatively, an individual\n   working for the server may, for personal\
    \ gain, misuse access to the\n   server to obtain LI.  Third, even with the most\
    \ secure and trusted\n   server, there is the risk that someone outside the system\
    \ will hack\n   into it in order to retrieve LI.  Last, there is always the potential\n\
    \   that someone would use the legal system to subpoena an individual's\n   records\
    \ from a Server.  Such a process would likely result in the\n   revelation of\

    \  If a Target requests a map from their present location\n   to a nearby store,\

    \ the Viewer could know the identity of\n   the Target, the Target's current location,\
    \ and the location where the\n   Target might be headed.\n   Data stored at the\
    \ Location Server can also create many of the\n   traffic analysis threats discussed\
    \ in Section 4.1 above.  If access\n   is gained not only to the fact of the LO\

    \ a similar threat to the information maintained at a Location\n   Server, discussed\
    \ above.  A court subpoena or warrant for an\n   individual's device could additionally\
    \ reveal a similar log.\n   Additionally, depending on the device, there is always\
    \ the potential\n   for data to be compromised in some way.  For a Device with\
    \ a screen,\n   there is always the potential that another individual will have\
    \ the\n   opportunity to view the Device display without the user's knowledge.\n\
    \   A Device that provides verbal feedback (i.e., to give directions to\n   the\
    \ blind) creates additional potential for LI to be compromised.  If\n   the Target/Viewer\
    \ is sitting in a public place and requests\n   directions from the Target's home\
    \ to another location, anyone who can\n   hear the Device output may be able to\
    \ determine the Target's\n   identity, their residence, and possibly the location\
    \ to which they\n   are headed.\n   In addition, if the device retained location\
    \ information and the\n   Device were lost or stolen, someone other than the Rule\
    \ Maker could\n   potentially access information regarding who LI was sent to\
    \ and when,\n   as well as potentially the location of the Target during each\n\
    \   transaction.  Such information could enable an entity to determine\n   significant\
    \ private information based on who the owner of the Device\n   has associated\
    \ with in the past, as well as each location where the\n   Target has been and\
    \ for how long.\n"

  - "4.2.4.  Information Contained in Rules\n   In many instances, the Rules a Rule\
    \ Maker creates will reveal\n   information either about the Rule Maker or the\
    \ Target.  A rule that\n   degrades all information sent out by approximately\
    \ 25 miles might\n   tell an interceptor how to determine the Target's true location.\
    \  A\n   Rule that states, \"Tell my boss what room I'm in when I'm in the\n \
    \  building, but when I'm outside the building between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.\n   tell\
    \ him I'm in the building,\" would reveal a lot more information\n   than most\
    \ employees would desire.  Any boss who was the Location\n   Recipient who received\
    \ LI that specified \"in the building\" would then\n   realize that the employee\
    \ was elsewhere.\n   In addition, if an entity had access to a log of data at\
    \ the Location\n   Server or at a Device, knowledge of the content of Rules would\
    \ enable\n   a sort of \"decoding\" of the location information of the device\
    \ to\n   something more accurate.  Thus, my boss could not only tell where I\n\
    \   am at this minute, but could tell how many times over the last year I\n  \
    \ had been outside the building between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.\n   The Rules themselves\
    \ may also reveal information about the Target.  A\n   rule such as the one above\
    \ would clearly reveal the employment\n   relationship between the two individuals,\
    \ as well as the fact that\n   the employee was hiding something from the employer.\n\
    \   In combination with other information, the location information may\n   enable\
    \ the identification of the Target.\n"

    \ would also compromise LI.\n   Without default Rules for LOs, it is likely that\

- title: 5.1.  Fair Information Practices
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Fair Information Practices\n   Principles of fair information practices\
    \ require entities that handle\n   personal information to meet certain obligations\
    \ with respect to its\n   collection, use, maintenance and security, and give\
    \ individuals whose\n   personal information is collected certain due process-like\
    \ rights in\n   the handling of their information.  Fair information practices\
    \ are\n   designed to prevent specific threats posed by the collection of\n  \
    \ personal information about individuals.  For this reason, fair\n   information\
    \ practices are \"countermeasures\" that should be reflected\n   in technical\
    \ systems that handle personal information and the Rules\n   that govern their\
    \ use.  A brief discussion of fair information\n   practices may be beneficial\
    \ in formulating requirements for the LO.\n   There are seven main principles\
    \ of fair information practices:\n   1. Openness: The existence of a record-keeping\
    \ system for personal\n      information must be known, along with a description\
    \ of the main\n      purpose and uses of the data.  Thus, any entity that collects\
    \ LI\n      should inform individuals that this information is being collected\n\
    \      and inform them about what the LI is being used for.  Openness is\n   \
    \   designed to prevent the creation of secret systems.\n   2. Individual Participation:\
    \ Individuals should have a right to view\n      all information collected about\
    \ them, and to be able to correct or\n      remove data that is not timely, accurate,\
    \ relevant, or complete.\n      The practice of individual participation acknowledges\
    \ that\n      sometimes information that is collected may be inaccurate or\n \
    \     inappropriate.\n   3. Collection Limitation: Data should be collected by\
    \ lawful and fair\n      means and should be collected, where appropriate, with\
    \ the\n      knowledge or consent of the subject.  Data collection should be\n\
    \      minimized to that which is necessary to support the transaction.\n    \
    \  Placing limits on collection helps protect individuals from the\n      dangers\
    \ of overcollection - both in terms of collecting too much\n      information,\
    \ or of collecting information for too long of a time\n      period.\n   4. Data\
    \ Quality: Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for\n      which it\
    \ is collected and used; personal information should be\n      accurate, complete,\
    \ and timely.  The requirement of data quality\n      is designed to prevent particular\
    \ kinds of harms that can flow\n      from the use (appropriate or inappropriate)\
    \ of personal\n      information.\n   5. Finality: There should be limits to the\
    \ use and disclosure of\n      personal data: data should be used only for purposes\
    \ specified at\n      the time of collection; data should not be otherwise used\
    \ or\n      disclosed without the consent of the data subject or other legal\n\
    \      authority.  A consumer who provides LI to a business in order to\n    \
    \  receive directions, for example, does not provide that information\n      for\
    \ any other purpose.  The business should then only use that LI\n      to provide\
    \ directions, and not for other purposes.\n   6. Security: Personal Data should\
    \ be protected by reasonable security\n      safeguards against such risks as\
    \ loss, unauthorized access,\n      destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.\
    \  While some\n      security measures may take place outside of the LO (i.e.,\
    \ limiting\n      employee access to Location Servers), other measures may be\
    \ done\n      through the LO or LO applications.\n   7. Accountability: Record\
    \ keepers should be accountable for complying\n      with fair information practices.\
    \  It will typically be easier for\n      an individual to enforce these practices\
    \ if they are explicitly\n      written - either in the Rules written by the Rule\
    \ Maker, or in\n      contracts between the individual and a trusted entity.\n"

- title: 6.1.1.  Rule Maker Should Define Rules
  contents:
  - "6.1.1.  Rule Maker Should Define Rules\n   The Rule Maker for a given Device\
    \ will generally be either the user\n   of, or owner of, the Device.  In certain\
    \ circumstances, the Rule\n   Maker may be both of these entities.  Depending\
    \ on the device, the\n   Rule Maker may or may not be the individual most closely\
    \ aligned with\n   the Target.  For instance, a child carrying a cell phone may\
    \ be the\n   Target, but the parent of that child would likely be the Rule Maker\n\
    \   for the Device.  Giving the Rule Maker control is a potential\n   opportunity\
    \ to buttress the consent component of the collection\n   limitation and finality\
    \ principles discussed above.\n"
- title: 6.1.2.  Geopriv Should Have Default Rules
  contents:
  - "6.1.2.  Geopriv Should Have Default Rules\n   Because some Rule Makers may not\
    \ be informed about the role Rules\n   play in the disclosure of their LI, Geopriv\
    \ should include default\n   Rules.  The Rule Maker is, of course, always free\
    \ to change his or\n   her Rules to provide more or less protection.  To protect\
    \ privacy and\n   physical safety, default Rules should, at a minimum, limit disclosure\n\
    \   and retention of LI.\n   Default Rules are also necessary for so-called \"\
    dumb\" Location\n   Generators (LG).  If a LG is unable to determine the Rules\
    \ set by the\n   Rule Maker before publishing the LO on to a Location Server,\
    \ it is\n   important that some default Rules protect that LO in transit, and\n\
    \   ensure that the LO is eventually only sent to authorized Location\n   Recipients.\
    \  These default LG Rules would help prevent many of the\n   threats discussed\
    \ in this document.  The Rule Maker should be able to\n   determine the content\
    \ of these default Rules at any time.\n"
- title: 6.1.3.  Location Recipient Should Not Be Aware of All Rules
  contents:
  - "6.1.3.  Location Recipient Should Not Be Aware of All Rules\n   A Viewer should\
    \ not be aware of the full Rules defined by the Rule\n   Maker.  The Viewer will\
    \ only need to be aware of those Rules it must\n   obey (i.e., those regarding\
    \ its use and retention of the LI).  Other\n   Rules, such as those specifying\
    \ the accuracy or filtering of the LI,\n   or rules that do not cover the given\
    \ interaction should not be\n   revealed to the Viewer.  This countermeasure is\
    \ consistent with the\n   minimization component of the collection limitation\
    \ principle and\n   ensures that the Rule Maker reveals only what he intends to\
    \ reveal.\n"
- title: 6.1.4.  Certain Rules Should Travel With the LO
  contents:
  - "6.1.4.  Certain Rules Should Travel With the LO\n   Security of LI at the device\
    \ level is a bit complicated, as the Rule\n   Maker has no real control over what\
    \ is done with the LI once it\n   arrives at the Location Recipient.  If certain\
    \ Rules travel with the\n   LO, the Rule Maker can encourage Viewer compliance\
    \ with its Rules.\n   Potentially, a Rule could travel with the LO indicating\
    \ when it was\n   time to purge the data, preventing the compilation of a \"log\"\
    \ of the\n   Target's LI on any Device involved in the transmission of the LO.\n\
    \   Allowing Rules to travel with the LO has the potential to limit the\n   opportunity\
    \ for traffic analysis attacks.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Protection of Identities
  contents:

    \ of the LO.  While, in\n   many instances, some form of identification of the\
    \ Target, Rule\n   Maker, and Viewer will be necessary for authentication, there\
    \ are\n   various methods to separate these authentication \"credentials\" from\n\
    \   the true identity of these devices.  These countermeasures are\n   particularly\
    \ useful in that compromise of a log of LI, no matter\n   where the source, is\

    \  These identifiers would still allow\n   authentication, ensuring that only\
    \ appropriate Location Recipients\n   received the LO.  At the same time, however,\

    \ would have two \"credentials\"\n   associated with an LI transmission: one linked\
