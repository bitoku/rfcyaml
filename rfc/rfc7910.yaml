- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) [RFC5798]\
    \ is a\n   redundancy protocol for establishing a fault-tolerant default router.\n\
    \   The protocol establishes a framework between network devices in order\n  \
    \ to achieve default device failover if the primary devices become\n   inaccessible.\n\
    \   Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) [RFC7761] has no inherent\n   redundancy\
    \ capabilities and its operation is completely independent\n   of VRRP group states.\
    \  As a result, IP multicast traffic is not\n   necessarily forwarded by the same\
    \ device that is elected by VRRP.\n   The VRRP-aware PIM feature provides consistent\
    \ IP multicast\n   forwarding in a redundant network with virtual routing groups\n\
    \   enabled.\n   In a multi-access segment (such as LAN), the elected PIM designated\n\
    \   router (DR) is unaware of the redundancy configuration, and the\n   elected\
    \ DR and VRRP master router (MR) may not be the same.  In order\n   to ensure\
    \ that the PIM DR is always able to forward a PIM Join/Prune\n   (J/P) message\
    \ towards Rendezvous Point (RP) or first-hop router, the\n   VRRP MR becomes the\
    \ PIM DR (if there is only one VRRP group).  PIM is\n   responsible for adjusting\
    \ the DR priority based on the group state.\n   When a failover occurs, multicast\
    \ states are created on the new MR\n   elected by the VRRP group and the MR assumes\
    \ responsibility for the\n   routing and forwarding of all the traffic addressed\
    \ to the VRRP\n   virtual IP address (vIP).  This ensures that the PIM DR runs\
    \ on the\n   same router as the VRRP MR and maintains multicast routing (mroute)\n\
    \   states.  It enables multicast traffic to be forwarded through the\n   VRRP\
    \ MR, allowing PIM to leverage VRRP redundancy, avoid potential\n   duplicate\
    \ traffic, and enable failover, depending on the VRRP states\n   in the router.\n\
    \   This mechanism can be safely deployed into a PIM network without\n   changing\
    \ the behavior of other routers.  When only a specific set of\n   routers enable\
    \ this feature, a user can configure PIM interfaces to\n   track state-change\
    \ events of desired VRRP group(s).  When a router\n   becomes the VRRP MR, the\
    \ PIM component applies the user-defined DR\n   priority value to the interface\
    \ in order to make it PIM DR.  Other\n   routers will not break the functionality\
    \ of this feature, as long as\n   their configured DR priority does not conflict\
    \ with the participating\n   routers.  When deployed in a PIM transit network,\
    \ downstream routers\n   should configure the static route to use vIP as the next-hop\
    \ address\n   for PIM J/P messages in order to take advantage of this feature.\
    \  If\n   dynamic routing is used and the next-hop address is selected by\n  \
    \ unicast routing information as described in [RFC5294], then these\n   routes\
    \ cannot leverage the VRRP redundancy and failover mechanism.\n   These downstream\
    \ routers, however, do not have to support this new\n   feature and there is no\
    \ additional configuration or coordination\n   required from a manageability point\
    \ of view.  This mechanism does not\n   change any bit on the wire, and it has\
    \ been implemented on Cisco IOS\n   software.\n"
- title: 2.  Tracking and Failover
  contents:
  - "2.  Tracking and Failover\n   Without the mechanisms described in this document,\
    \ a PIM component\n   will send PIM J/P messages with the DR's IP address to upstream\n\
    \   routers.  A GenID (Generation Identifier) in a PIM Hello message is\n   randomly\
    \ selected when the router boots and remains the same as long\n   as the router\
    \ is up.  A PIM neighbor reboot can easily be detected if\n   its GenID is different\
    \ from before; in this case, the PIM J/P and\n   RP-Set information can be redistributed\
    \ to the rebooted neighbor.\n   With the VRRP-aware PIM mechanism enabled, the\
    \ PIM component listens\n   to the state-change notifications from VRRP and automatically\
    \ adjusts\n   the priority of the PIM DR based on the VRRP state and ensures the\n\
    \   VRRP MR (if there is only one VRRP group) becomes the DR of the LAN.\n   If\
    \ there are multiple VRRP groups, the DR is determined by the user-\n   configured\
    \ priority value.\n   Upon failover, the PIM component triggers communication\
    \ between\n   upstream and downstream routers in order to create mroute states\
    \ on\n   the new VRRP MR.  The PIM component sends an additional PIM Hello\n \
    \  message using the VRRP vIP as the source address for each active VRRP\n   group\
    \ when a router becomes the VRRP MR.  The PIM Hello message with\n   a new GenID\
    \ will trigger other routers to respond to the VRRP\n   failover event in the\
    \ same way as the PIM neighbor reboot event as\n   described in [RFC5294].  Specifically,\
    \ when a downstream router\n   receives this PIM Hello message, it will add the\
    \ source IP address\n   (in this case the VRRP vIP) into its PIM neighbor list\
    \ and\n   immediately send triggered PIM J/P messages towards vIP.  Upstream\n\
    \   routers will process PIM J/P messages based on the VRRP group state.\n   If\
    \ the PIM J/P next-hop address matches the VRRP vIP, only the\n   current VRRP\
    \ MR will process the PIM J/P messages.  This allows all\n   PIM J/P messages\
    \ to reach the VRRP group vIP and minimizes changes\n   and configurations at\
    \ the downstream routers.\n   Alternatively, the implementation can choose to\
    \ have all VRRP passive\n   routers maintain mroute states and record the GenID\
    \ of the current\n   MR.  When a passive router becomes the MR, it uses the existing\n\
    \   mroute states and the recorded MR GenID in its PIM Hello message.\n   This\
    \ will avoid resending PIM J/P messages upon failover and will\n   eliminate the\
    \ requirement of an additional PIM Hello with vIP.  There\n   is no change in\
    \ on-the-wire behavior or in the PIM and VRRP message\n   format.\n"
- title: 3.  PIM Assert Metric Auto-Adjustment
  contents:
  - "3.  PIM Assert Metric Auto-Adjustment\n   It is possible that, after the VRRP\
    \ MR switches from router A to B, A\n   would still forward multicast traffic,\
    \ which will result in duplicate\n   traffic.  The PIM Assert mechanism will kick\
    \ in because PIM Assert\n   with redundancy is enabled.\n   o  If there is only\
    \ one VRRP group, passive routers will send an\n      arbitrary penalty metric\
    \ preference (PIM_ASSERT_INFINITY - 1) and\n      make MR the Assert winner.\n\
    \   o  If there are multiples VRRP groups configured on an interface, the\n  \
    \    Assert metric preference will be (PIM_ASSERT_INFINITY - 1) if and\n     \
    \ only if all VRRP groups are in Passive state.\n   o  If there is at least one\
    \ VRRP group in Active state, then the\n      original Assert metric preference\
    \ will be used.  That is, the\n      winner will be selected between routers using\
    \ their real Assert\n      metric preference with at least one active VRRP Group,\
    \ as if no\n      VRRP is involved.\n"
- title: 4.  DF Election for BiDir Group
  contents:
  - "4.  DF Election for BiDir Group\n   Change to Designated Forwarder (DF) offer/winner\
    \ metric is handled\n   similarly to PIM Assert handling with VRRP.\n   o  If\
    \ there is only one VRRP group, passive routers will send a large\n      penalty\
    \ metric preference in an offer (PIM_BIDIR_INFINITY_PREF- 1)\n      and make MR\
    \ the DF winner.\n   o  If there are multiples VRRP groups configured on an interface,\
    \ the\n      offer metric preference will be (PIM_BIDIR_INFINITY_PREF- 1) if\n\
    \      and only if all VRRP groups are in Passive state.\n   o  If there is at\
    \ least one VRRP group in Active state, then the\n      original offer metric\
    \ preference to RP will be used.  That is, the\n      winner will be selected\
    \ between routers using their real offer\n      metric, as if no VRRP is involved.\n"
- title: 5.  Tracking Multiple VRRP Groups on an Interface
  contents:
  - "5.  Tracking Multiple VRRP Groups on an Interface\n   A user can configure a\
    \ PIM component to track more than one VRRP\n   groups on an interface.  This\
    \ allows other applications to exploit\n   PIM/VRRP interoperability to achieve\
    \ various goals (e.g., load\n   balancing).  Since each VRRP group that is configured\
    \ on an interface\n   could be in different states at any moment, the DR priority\
    \ is\n   adjusted.  The PIM Assert metric and PIM BiDir DF metric should be\n\
    \   adjusted if and only if all VRRP groups that are configured on an\n   interface\
    \ are in Passive (non-Active) states to ensure that\n   interfaces with all-passive\
    \ VRRP groups do not win DR, Assert, and DF\n   election.  In other words, the\
    \ DR, Assert, and DF winners will be\n   elected among the interfaces with at\
    \ least one active VRRP group.\n"
- title: 6.  Support of HSRP
  contents:
  - "6.  Support of HSRP\n   Although there are differences between VRRP and the Hot\
    \ Standby\n   Router Protocol (HSRP) [RFC2281] -- including the number of backup\n\
    \   (standby) routers, virtual IP address, and timer intervals -- the\n   proposed\
    \ scheme can also enable HSRP-aware PIM with similar failover\n   and the tracking\
    \ mechanism described in this document.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The proposed tracking mechanism does not discuss\
    \ adding\n   authentication to the protocols and introduces no new negative impact\n\
    \   or threats on security to PIM in either SSM (Source-Specific\n   Multicast)\
    \ or ASM (Any-Source Multicast) mode.  Note that VRRP\n   messages from malicious\
    \ nodes could cause unexpected behaviors such\n   as multiple MRs and PIM DRs,\
    \ which are associated with VRRP-specific\n   security issues.  To mitigate the\
    \ vulnerability of frequent VRRP and\n   PIM DR state change from malicious attack,\
    \ an implementation can\n   choose to enable VRRP preemption such that a higher-priority\
    \ VRRP\n   backup router does not take over for a lower-priority MR; this will\n\
    \   reduce the state-change notifications to a PIM component and\n   subsequent\
    \ mroute state changes.  Detailed analysis of PIM and VRRP\n   security is provided\
    \ in [RFC5294] and [RFC5798].\n"
