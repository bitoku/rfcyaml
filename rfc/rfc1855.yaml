  - "1.0  Introduction\n   In the past, the population of people using the Internet\
    \ had \"grown\n   up\" with the Internet, were technically minded, and understood\
    \ the\n   nature of the transport and the protocols.  Today, the community of\n\
    \   Internet users includes people who are new to the environment.  These\n  \
    \ \"Newbies\" are unfamiliar with the culture and don't need to know\n   about\
    \ transport and protocols. In order to bring these new users into\n   the Internet\
    \ culture quickly, this Guide offers a minimum set of\n   behaviors which organizations\
    \ and individuals may take and adapt for\n   their own use.  Individuals should\
    \ be aware that no matter who\n   supplies their Internet access, be it an Internet\
    \ Service Provider\n   through a private account, or a student account at a University,\
    \ or\n   an account through a corporation, that those organizations have\n   regulations\
    \ about ownership of mail and files, about what is proper\n   to post or send,\
    \ and how to present yourself.  Be sure to check with\n   the local authority\
    \ for specific guidelines.\n   We've organized this material into three sections:\
    \ One-to-one\n   communication, which includes mail and talk; One-to-many\n  \
    \ communications, which includes mailing lists and NetNews; and\n   Information\
    \ Services, which includes ftp, WWW, Wais, Gopher, MUDs and\n   MOOs.   Finally,\
    \ we have a Selected Bibliography, which may be used\n   for reference.\n"

  - "2.0  One-to-One Communication (electronic mail, talk)\n   We define one-to-one\
    \ communications as those in which a person is\n   communicating with another\
    \ person as if face-to-face: a dialog.  In\n   general, rules of common courtesy\
    \ for interaction with people should\n   be in force for any situation and on\
    \ the Internet it's doubly\n   important where, for example, body language and\
    \ tone of voice must be\n   inferred. For more information on Netiquette for communicating\

  - "2.1.1 For mail:\n    - Unless you have your own Internet access through an Internet\n\
    \      provider, be sure to check with your employer about ownership\n      of\
    \ electronic mail. Laws about the ownership of electronic mail\n      vary from\
    \ place to place.\n    - Unless you are using an encryption device (hardware or\
    \ software),\n      you should assume that mail on the Internet is not secure.\
    \  Never\n      put in a mail message anything you would not put on a postcard.\n\
    \    - Respect the copyright on material that you reproduce.  Almost\n      every\
    \ country has copyright laws.\n    - If you are forwarding or re-posting a message\
    \ you've received, do\n      not change the wording.  If the message was a personal\
    \ message to\n      you and you are re-posting to a group, you should ask permission\n\
    \      first.  You may shorten the message and quote only relevant parts,\n  \
    \    but be sure you give proper attribution.\n    - Never send chain letters\
    \ via electronic mail.  Chain letters\n      are forbidden on the Internet.  Your\
    \ network privileges\n      will be revoked.  Notify your local system administrator\n\
    \      if your ever receive one.\n    - A good rule of thumb:  Be conservative\
    \ in what you send and\n      liberal in what you receive.  You should not send\
    \ heated messages\n      (we call these \"flames\") even if you are provoked.\
    \  On the other\n      hand, you shouldn't be surprised if you get flamed and\
    \ it's\n      prudent not to respond to flames.\n    - In general, it's a good\
    \ idea to at least check all your mail\n      subjects before responding to a\
    \ message.  Sometimes a person who\n      asks you for help (or clarification)\
    \ will send another message\n      which effectively says \"Never Mind\".  Also\
    \ make sure that any\n      message you respond to was directed to you.  You might\
    \ be cc:ed\n      rather than the primary recipient.\n    - Make things easy for\
    \ the recipient.  Many mailers strip header\n      information which includes\
    \ your return address.  In order to\n      ensure that people know who you are,\
    \ be sure to include a line\n      or two at the end of your message with contact\
    \ information.  You\n      can create this file ahead of time and add it to the\
    \ end of your\n      messages.  (Some mailers do this automatically.)  In Internet\n\
    \      parlance, this is known as a \".sig\" or \"signature\" file.  Your\n  \
    \    .sig file takes the place of your business card.  (And you can\n      have\
    \ more than one to apply in different circumstances.)\n    - Be careful when addressing\
    \ mail.  There are addresses which\n      may go to a group but the address looks\
    \ like it is just one\n      person.  Know to whom you are sending.\n    - Watch\
    \ cc's when replying.  Don't continue to include\n      people if the messages\
    \ have become a 2-way conversation.\n    - In general, most people who use the\
    \ Internet don't have time\n      to answer general questions about the Internet\
    \ and its workings.\n      Don't send unsolicited mail asking for information\
    \ to people\n      whose names you might have seen in RFCs or on mailing lists.\n\
    \    - Remember that people with whom you communicate are located across\n   \
    \   the globe.  If you send a message to which you want an immediate\n      response,\
    \ the person receiving it might be at home asleep when it\n      arrives.  Give\
    \ them a chance to wake up, come to work, and login\n      before assuming the\
    \ mail didn't arrive or that they don't care.\n    - Verify all addresses before\
    \ initiating long or personal discourse.\n      It's also a good practice to include\
    \ the word \"Long\" in the\n      subject header so the recipient knows the message\
    \ will take time\n      to read and respond to. Over 100 lines is considered \"\
    long\".\n    - Know whom to contact for help.  Usually you will have resources\n\
    \      close at hand.  Check locally for people who can help you with\n      software\
    \ and system problems.  Also, know whom to go to if you\n      receive anything\
    \ questionable or illegal.  Most sites also\n      have \"Postmaster\" aliased\
    \ to a knowledgeable user, so you\n      can send mail to this address to get\
    \ help with mail.\n    - Remember that the recipient is a human being whose culture,\n\
    \      language, and humor have different points of reference from your\n    \
    \  own.  Remember that date formats, measurements, and idioms may\n      not travel\
    \ well.   Be especially careful with sarcasm.\n    - Use mixed case.  UPPER CASE\
    \ LOOKS AS IF YOU'RE SHOUTING.\n    - Use symbols for emphasis.  That *is* what\
    \ I meant.  Use\n      underscores for underlining. _War and Peace_ is my favorite\n\
    \      book.\n    - Use smileys to indicate tone of voice, but use them sparingly.\n\
    \      :-) is an example of a smiley (Look sideways).  Don't assume\n      that\
    \ the inclusion of a smiley will make the recipient happy\n      with what you\
    \ say or wipe out an otherwise insulting comment.\n    - Wait overnight to send\
    \ emotional responses to messages.  If you\n      have really strong feelings\
    \ about a subject, indicate it via\n      FLAME ON/OFF enclosures.  For example:\n\
    \      FLAME ON:  This type of argument is not worth the bandwidth\n         \
    \        it takes to send it.  It's illogical and poorly\n                 reasoned.\
    \  The rest of the world agrees with me.\n      FLAME OFF\n    - Do not include\
    \ control characters or non-ASCII attachments in\n      messages unless they are\
    \ MIME attachments or unless your mailer\n      encodes these.  If you send encoded\
    \ messages make sure the\n      recipient can decode them.\n    - Be brief without\
    \ being overly terse.  When replying to a message,\n      include enough original\
    \ material to be understood but no more. It\n      is extremely bad form to simply\
    \ reply to a message by including\n      all the previous message: edit out all\
    \ the irrelevant material.\n    - Limit line length to fewer than 65 characters\
    \ and end a line\n      with a carriage return.\n    - Mail should have a subject\
    \ heading which reflects\n      the content of the message.\n    - If you include\
    \ a signature keep it short.  Rule of thumb\n      is no longer than 4 lines.\
    \  Remember that many people pay for\n      connectivity by the minute, and the\
    \ longer your message is,\n      the more they pay.\n    - Just as mail (today)\
    \ may not be private, mail (and news) are\n      (today) subject to forgery and\
    \ spoofing of various degrees of\n      detectability. Apply common sense \"reality\
    \ checks\" before\n      assuming a message is valid.\n    - If you think the\
    \ importance of a message justifies it, immediately\n      reply briefly to an\
    \ e-mail message to let the sender know you got\n      it, even if you will send\
    \ a longer reply later.\n    - \"Reasonable\" expectations for conduct via e-mail\
    \ depend on your\n      relationship to a person and the context of the communication.\n\
    \      Norms learned in a particular e-mail environment may not apply in\n   \
    \   general to your e-mail communication with people across the\n      Internet.\
    \  Be careful with slang or local acronyms.\n    - The cost of delivering an e-mail\
    \ message is, on the average, paid\n      about equally by the sender and the\
    \ recipient (or their\n      organizations). This is unlike other media such as\
    \ physical mail,\n      telephone, TV, or radio.  Sending someone mail may also\
    \ cost them\n      in other specific ways like network bandwidth, disk space or\
    \ CPU\n      usage.  This is a fundamental economic reason why unsolicited\n \
    \     e-mail advertising is unwelcome (and is forbidden in many contexts).\n \
    \   - Know how large a message you are sending.  Including large files\n     \
    \ such as Postscript files or programs may make your message so\n      large that\
    \ it cannot be delivered or at least consumes excessive\n      resources.  A good\
    \ rule of thumb would be not to send a file\n      larger than 50 Kilobytes. \
    \ Consider file transfer as an\n      alternative, or cutting the file into smaller\
    \ chunks and sending\n      each as a separate message.\n    - Don't send large\
    \ amounts of unsolicited information to people.\n    - If your mail system allows\
    \ you to forward mail, beware the dreaded\n      forwarding loop.  Be sure you\
    \ haven't set up forwarding on several\n      hosts so that a message sent to\
    \ you gets into an endless loop from\n      one computer to the next to the next.\n"
- title: '2.1.2 For talk:'
  contents:
  - "2.1.2 For talk:\n   Talk is a set of protocols which allow two people to have\
    \ an\n   interactive dialogue via computer.\n    - Use mixed case  and proper\
    \ punctuation, as though you were typing\n      a letter or sending mail.\n  \
    \  - Don't run off the end of a line and simply let the terminal wrap;\n     \
    \ use a Carriage Return (CR) at the end of the line.  Also, don't\n      assume\
    \ your screen size is the same as everyone else's.  A good\n      rule of thumb\
    \ is to write out no more than 70 characters, and no\n      more than 12 lines\
    \ (since you're using a split screen).\n    - Leave some margin; don't write to\
    \ the edge of the screen.\n    - Use two CRs to indicate that you are done and\
    \ the other person may\n      start typing.  (blank line).\n    - Always say goodbye,\
    \ or some other farewell, and wait to see a\n      farewell from the other person\
    \ before killing the session.  This\n      is especially important when you are\
    \ communicating with someone\n      a long way away.  Remember that your communication\
    \ relies on both\n      bandwidth (the size of the pipe) and latency (the speed\
    \ of light).\n    - Remember that talk is an interruption to the other person.\
    \  Only\n      use as appropriate.  And never talk to strangers.\n    - The reasons\
    \ for not getting a reply are many.  Don't assume\n      that everything is working\
    \ correctly.  Not all versions of\n      talk are compatible.\n    - If left on\
    \ its own, talk re-rings the recipient.  Let it ring\n      one or two times,\
    \ then kill it.\n    - If a person doesn't respond you might try another tty.\
    \  Use finger\n      to determine which are open.  If the person still doesn't\
    \ respond,\n      do not continue to send.\n    - Talk shows your typing ability.\
    \  If you type slowly and make\n      mistakes when typing it is often not worth\
    \ the time of trying to\n      correct, as the other person can usually see what\
    \ you meant.\n   - Be careful if you have more than one talk session going!\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.1 General Guidelines for mailing lists and NetNews\n    - Read both mailing\
    \ lists and newsgroups for one to two months before\n      you post anything.\
    \  This helps you to get an understanding of\n      the culture of the group.\n\
    \    - Do not blame the system administrator for the behavior of the\n      system\
    \ users.\n    - Consider that a large audience will see your posts.\n      That\
    \ may include your present or your next boss.  Take\n      care in what you write.\
    \  Remember too, that mailing lists and\n      Newsgroups are frequently archived,\
    \ and that your words may be\n      stored for a very long time in a place to\
    \ which many people have\n      access.\n    - Assume that individuals speak for\
    \ themselves, and what they\n      say does not represent their organization (unless\
    \ stated\n      explicitly).\n    - Remember that both mail and news take system\
    \ resources.  Pay\n      attention to any specific rules covering their uses your\n\
    \      organization may have.\n    - Messages and articles should be brief and\
    \ to the point.  Don't\n      wander off-topic, don't ramble and don't send mail\
    \ or post\n      messages solely to point out other people's errors in typing\n\
    \      or spelling.  These, more than any other behavior, mark you\n      as an\
    \ immature beginner.\n    - Subject lines should follow the conventions of the\
    \ group.\n    - Forgeries and spoofing are not approved behavior.\n    - Advertising\
    \ is welcomed on some lists and Newsgroups, and abhorred\n      on others!  This\
    \ is another example of knowing your audience\n      before you post.  Unsolicited\
    \ advertising which is completely\n      off-topic will most certainly guarantee\
    \ that you get a lot of\n      hate mail.\n    - If you are sending a reply to\
    \ a message or a posting be sure you\n      summarize the original at the top\
    \ of the message, or include just\n      enough text of the original to give a\
    \ context.  This will make\n      sure readers understand when they start to read\
    \ your response.\n      Since NetNews, especially, is proliferated by distributing\
    \ the\n      postings from one host to another, it is possible to see a\n    \
    \  response to a message before seeing the original.  Giving context\n      helps\
    \ everyone.  But do not include the entire original!\n    - Again, be sure to\
    \ have a signature which you attach to your\n      message.  This will guarantee\
    \ that any peculiarities of mailers or\n      newsreaders which strip header information\
    \ will not delete the\n      only reference in the message of how people may reach\
    \ you.\n    - Be careful when you reply to messages or postings.  Frequently\n\
    \      replies are sent back to the address which originated the post -\n    \
    \  which in many cases is the address of a list or group!  You may\n      accidentally\
    \ send a personal response to a great many people,\n      embarrassing all involved.\
    \  It's best to type in the address\n      instead of relying on \"reply.\"\n\
    \    - Delivery receipts, non-delivery notices, and vacation programs\n      are\
    \ neither totally standardized nor totally reliable across the\n      range of\
    \ systems connected to Internet mail.  They are invasive\n      when sent to mailing\
    \ lists, and some people consider delivery\n      receipts an invasion of privacy.\
    \  In short, do not use them.\n     - If you find a personal message has gone\
    \ to a list or group, send\n       an apology to the person and to the group.\n\
    \     - If you should find yourself in a disagreement with one person,\n     \
    \  make your responses to each other via mail rather than continue to\n      \
    \ send messages to the list or the group.  If you are debating a\n       point\
    \ on which the group might have some interest, you may\n       summarize for them\
    \ later.\n    - Don't get involved in flame wars.  Neither post nor respond\n\
    \      to incendiary material.\n    - Avoid sending messages or posting articles\
    \ which are no more than\n      gratuitous replies to replies.\n    - Be careful\
    \ with monospacing fonts and diagrams.  These will\n      display differently\
    \ on different systems, and with different\n      mailers on the same system.\n\
    \    - There are Newsgroups and Mailing Lists which discuss topics\n      of \
    \ wide varieties of interests.  These represent a diversity of\n      lifestyles,\
    \ religions, and cultures.  Posting articles or sending\n      messages to a group\
    \ whose point of view is offensive to you\n      simply to tell them they are\
    \ offensive is not acceptable.\n      Sexually and racially harassing messages\
    \ may also have legal\n      implications.  There is software available to filter\
    \ items\n      you might find objectionable.\n"

  - "3.1.2  Mailing List Guidelines\n   There are several ways to find information\

    \ sure you understand\n   your organization's policy about joining these lists\

    \ by the lists to which you subscribe.\n    - Save the subscription messages for\
    \ any lists you join.  These\n      usually tell you how to unsubscribe as well.\n\
    \    - In general, it's not possible to retrieve messages once you have\n    \
    \  sent them.  Even your system administrator will not be able to get\n      a\
    \ message back once you have sent it.  This means you must make\n      sure you\
    \ really want the message to go as you have written it.\n    - The auto-reply\
    \ feature of many mailers is useful for in-house\n      communication, but quite\
    \ annoying when sent to entire mailing\n      lists. Examine \"Reply-To\" addresses\
    \ when replying to messages\n      from lists.  Most auto-replys will go to all\
    \ members of the\n      list.\n    - Don't send large files to mailing lists when\
    \ Uniform\n      Resource Locators (URLs) or pointers to ftp-able versions\n \
    \     will do.  If you want to send it as multiple files, be\n      sure to follow\
    \ the culture of the group.  If you don't\n      know what that is, ask.\n   \
    \ - Consider unsubscribing or setting a \"nomail\" option (when it's\n      available)\
    \ when you cannot check your mail for an extended\n      period.\n    - When sending\
    \ a message to more than one mailing list, especially\n      if the lists are\
    \ closely related, apologize for cross-posting.\n    - If you ask a question,\
    \ be sure to post a summary.  When doing so,\n      truly summarize rather than\
    \ send a cumulation of the messages you\n      receive.\n    - Some mailing lists\
    \ are private.  Do not send mail to these lists\n      uninvited.  Do not report\
    \ mail from these lists to a wider\n      audience.\n    - If you are caught in\
    \ an argument, keep the discussion focused on\n      issues rather than the personalities\
    \ involved.\n"
- title: 3.1.3  NetNews Guidelines
  contents:
  - "3.1.3  NetNews Guidelines\n   NetNews is a globally distributed system which\
    \ allows people to\n   communicate on topics of specific interest.  It is divided\
    \ into\n   hierarchies, with the major divisions being: sci - science related\n\
    \   discussions; comp - computer related discussions; news - for\n   discussions\
    \ which center around NetNews itself; rec - recreational\n   activities; soc -\
    \ social issues; talk - long-winded never-ending\n   discussions; biz - business\
    \ related postings; and alt - the alternate\n   hierarchy.  Alt is so named because\
    \ creating an alt group does not go\n   through the same process as creating a\
    \ group in the other parts of\n   the hierarchy.  There are also regional hierarchies,\
    \ hierarchies\n   which are widely distributed such as Bionet, and your place\
    \ of\n   business may have its own groups as well.  Recently, a \"humanities\"\
    \n   hierarchy was added, and as time goes on its likely more will be\n   added.\
    \  For longer discussions on News see references [2,8,22,23] in\n   the Selected\
    \ Bibliography.\n    - In NetNews parlance, \"Posting\" refers to posting a new\
    \ article\n      to a group, or responding to a post someone else has posted.\n\
    \      \"Cross-Posting\" refers to posting a message to more than one\n      group.\
    \  If you introduce Cross-Posting to a group, or if you\n      direct \"Followup-To:\"\
    \ in the header of your posting, warn\n      readers!  Readers will usually assume\
    \ that the message was\n      posted to a specific group and that followups will\
    \ go to\n      that group.  Headers change this behavior.\n    - Read all of a\
    \ discussion in progress (we call this a thread)\n      before posting replies.\
    \  Avoid posting \"Me Too\" messages,\n      where content is limited to agreement\
    \ with previous posts.\n      Content of a follow-up post should exceed quoted\
    \ content.\n    - Send mail when an answer to a question is for one person only.\n\
    \      Remember that News has global distribution and the whole world\n      probably\
    \ is NOT interested in a personal response.  However, don't\n      hesitate to\
    \ post when something will be of general interest to the\n      Newsgroup participants.\n\
    \    - Check the \"Distribution\" section of the header, but don't\n      depend\
    \ on it.  Due to the complex method by which News is\n      delivered, Distribution\
    \ headers are unreliable.  But, if you\n      are posting something which will\
    \ be of interest to a limited\n      number or readers, use a distribution line\
    \ that attempts to\n      limit the distribution of your article to those people.\
    \  For\n      example, set the Distribution to be \"nj\" if you are posting\n\
    \      an article that will be of interest only to New Jersey readers.\n    -\
    \ If you feel an article will be of interest to more than one\n      Newsgroup,\
    \ be sure to CROSSPOST the article rather than individually\n      post it to\
    \ those groups.  In general, probably only five-to-six\n      groups will have\
    \ similar enough interests to warrant this.\n    - Consider using Reference sources\
    \ (Computer Manuals, Newspapers,\n      help files) before posting a question.\
    \  Asking a Newsgroup where\n      answers are readily available elsewhere generates\
    \ grumpy \"RTFM\"\n      (read the fine manual - although a more vulgar meaning\
    \ of the\n      word beginning with \"f\" is usually implied) messages.\n    -\
    \ Although there are Newsgroups which welcome advertising,\n      in general it\
    \ is considered nothing less than criminal\n      to advertise off-topic products.\
    \  Sending an advertisement\n      to each and every group will pretty much guarantee\
    \ your loss of\n      connectivity.\n    - If you discover an error in your post,\
    \ cancel it as soon as\n      possible.\n    - DO NOT attempt to cancel any articles\
    \ but your own.  Contact\n      your administrator if you don't know how to cancel\
    \ your post,\n      or if some other post, such as a chain letter, needs canceling.\n\
    \    - If you've posted something and don't see it immediately,\n      don't assume\
    \ it's failed and re-post it.\n    - Some groups permit (and some welcome) posts\
    \ which in other\n      circumstances would be considered to be in questionable\
    \ taste.\n      Still, there is no guarantee that all people reading the group\n\
    \      will appreciate the material as much as you do.  Use the Rotate\n     \
    \ utility (which rotates all the characters in your post by 13\n      positions\
    \ in the alphabet) to avoid giving offense.   The\n      Rot13 utility for Unix\
    \ is an example.\n    - In groups which discuss movies or books it is considered\
    \ essential\n      to mark posts which disclose significant content as \"Spoilers\"\
    .\n      Put this word in your Subject: line.  You may add blank lines to\n  \
    \    the beginning of your post to keep content out of sight, or you\n      may\
    \ Rotate it.\n    - Forging of news articles is generally censured. You can protect\n\
    \      yourself from forgeries by using software which generates a\n      manipulation\
    \ detection \"fingerprint\", such as PGP (in the US).\n    - Postings via anonymous\
    \ servers are accepted in some Newsgroups\n      and disliked in others.  Material\
    \ which is inappropriate when\n      posted under one's own name is still inappropriate\
    \ when posted\n      anonymously.\n    - Expect a slight delay in seeing your\
    \ post when posting to a\n      moderated group.  The moderator may change your\
    \ subject\n      line to have your post conform to a particular thread.\n    -\
    \ Don't get involved in flame wars.  Neither post nor respond\n      to incendiary\
    \ material.\n"

    \ If you have problems with any form of information service, start\n      problem\

    \ naming conventions to be enforced.  For\n      example, a \".doc\" file is not\

    \ www.xyz.com.\n      While it is useful to know these conventions, again, don't\n\
    \      necessarily rely on them.\n    - Know how file names work on your own system.\n\
    \    - Be aware of conventions used for providing information during\n      sessions.\

    \ have information about the files available.\n      But, don't assume that these\
    \ files are necessarily up-to-date\n      and/or accurate.\n    - Do NOT assume\
    \ that ANY information you find is up-to-date and/or\n      accurate.  Remember\
    \ that new technologies allow just about anyone\n      to be a publisher, but\
    \ not all people have discovered the\n      responsibilities which accompany publishing.\n\
    \    - Remember that unless you are sure that security and authentication\n  \
    \    technology is in use, that any information you submit to a system\n     \
    \ is being transmitted over the Internet \"in the clear\", with no\n      protection\

    \      originate in a geography which finds them acceptable.  Keep an open\n \

    \ use someone else's FTP site to deposit materials you\n      wish other people\
