  - "Abstract\n   Location of web information for particular companies based on their\n\
    \   names has become an increasingly difficult problem as the Internet\n   and\
    \ the web grow.   The use of a naming convention and the domain\n   name system\
    \ (DNS) for that purpose has caused complications for the\n   latter while not\
    \ solving the problem.  While there have been several\n   proposals to use contemporary,\
    \ high-capability, directory service and\n   search protocols to reduce the dependencies\
    \ on DNS conventions, none\n   of them have been significantly deployed.\n   This\
    \ document proposes a company name to URL mapping service based on\n   the oldest\
    \ and least complex of Internet directory protocols, whois,\n   in order to explore\
    \ whether an extremely simple and widely-deployed\n   protocol can succeed where\
    \ more complex and powerful options have\n   failed or been excessively delayed.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction and Context
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction and Context\n   In recent months, there have been many discussions\
    \ in various\n   segments of the Internet community about \"the top level domain\n\
    \   problem\".  Perhaps characteristically, that term is used by different\n \
    \  groups to identify different, and perhaps nearly orthogonal, issues.\n   Those\
    \ issues include:\n   1.1.  A \"domain administration policy\" issue.\n   1.2.\
    \  A \"name ownership\" issue, of which the trademark issue may\n         constitute\
    \ a special case.\n   1.3.  An information location issue, specifically the problem\
    \ of\n         locating the appropriate domain, or information tied to a\n   \
    \      domain, for an entity given the name by which that entity is\n        \
    \ usually known.\n   Of these, controversies about the first two may be inevitable\n\
    \   consequences of the growth of the Internet.  There have been\n   intermittent\
    \ difficulties with top level domain adminstration and\n   various attempts to\
    \ use the domain registry function as a mechanism\n   for control of service providers\
    \ or services from time to time since\n   a large number of such domains started\
    \ being allocated.  Those\n   problems led to the publication of the policy guidelines\
    \ of\n   [RFC1591].\n   The third appears to be largely a consequence of the explosive\
    \ growth\n   of the World Wide Web and, in particular, the exposure of URL formats\n\
    \   [URL] to the end user because no other mechanisms have been\n   available.\
    \  The absence of an appropriate and adequately-deployed\n   directory service\
    \ has led to the assumption that it should be\n   possible to locate the web pages\
    \ for a company by use of a naming\n   convention involving that company's name\
    \ or product name, i.e., for\n   the XYZ Company, a web page located at\n    \
    \    http://www.xyz.com/\n   or\n        http://www.xyz-company.com/\n   has been\
    \ assumed.\n   However, as the network grows and as increasing numbers of web\
    \ sites\n   are rooted in domains other than \".COM\", this convention becomes\n\
    \   difficult to sustain: there will be too many organizations or\n   companies\
    \ with legitimate claims --perhaps in different lines of\n   business or jurisdictions--\
    \ to the same short descriptive names.  For\n   that reason, there has been a\
    \ general sense in the community for\n   several years that the solution to this\
    \ information location problem\n   lies, not in changes to the domain name system,\
    \ but in some type of\n   directory service.\n   But such directory services have\
    \ not come into being.  There has been\n   ongoing controversy about choices of\
    \ protocols and accessing\n   mechanisms.  IETF has published specifications for\
    \ several different\n   directory and search protocols, including [WHOIS++], [RWHOIS],\n\
    \   [LDAP], [X500], [GOPHER].  One hypothesis about why this has not\n   happened\
    \ is that these mechanisms have been hard to select and deploy\n   because they\
    \ are much more complex than is necessary.  This document\n   proposes an extremely\
    \ simple alternative.\n"
- title: 2. Using WHOIS
  contents:
  - "2. Using WHOIS\n   The WHOIS protocol is the oldest directory access protocol\
    \ in use on\n   the Internet, dating in published form to March 1982 and first\n\
    \   implemented somewhat earlier.  The procotol itself is simple and\n   minimalist:\
    \ the client opens a telnet connection to the WHOIS port\n   (43) and transmits\
    \ a line over it.  The server looks up the line in a\n   fashion that it defines,\
    \ returns one or more lines of information to\n   the client, and closes the connection.\n\
    \   We suggest that modifications or add-ins be created to Web browsers\n   that\
    \ would access a new, commercially-provided Whois server, sending\n   a putative\
    \ company name and receiving back one or more lines, each\n   containing a URL\
    \ followed by one or more blanks and then a matching\n   company name (that order\
    \ was chosen to minimize parsing problems:\n   since URLs cannot contain blanks,\
    \ the first blank character marks the\n   end of the URL and the next non-blank\
    \ marks the beginning of the\n   company name).  As is usual with Whois, the criteria\
    \ used by the\n   server to match the incoming string is at the server's discretion.\n\
    \   The difference between this and the protocol as documented in [WHOIS]\n  \
    \ is that exactly one company name is returned per line (see section 3\n   for\
    \ details of syntax).\n   The client would then be expected to:\n   (i) If a single\
    \ line (company name and URL) is returned, either\n       ask for confirmation\
    \ or simply fetch the associated URL as if it\n       had been typed by the user.\n\
    \   (ii) If multiple lines (names) are returned, present the user with\n     \
    \   a choice, presumably showing company names rather than (or\n        supplemented\
    \ by) URLs, then fetch using the URL selected.\n   Obviously, while the most convenient\
    \ use of the services contemplated\n   in this document would occur through a\
    \ client that was part of, or\n   intimately connected with, a Web browser, a\
    \ user without that type of\n   facility could utilize a traditional WHOIS client\
    \ and paste or\n   otherwise transfer the relevant information into the target\
    \ location\n   of a browser.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1 Line sent from client to server.\n   These lines may take either of two forms:\n\
    \   (i) A simple 7-bit ASCII string, containing a \"company name\"\n   (ii) A\
    \ string in the format (using the ABNF notation of RFC 2234\n        [ABNF]):\n\
    \       Variation \"/\" 1*Octet\n           Variation :== \"0\" | ( Non-zero-digit\

    \           Digit :== 0 | Non-zero-digit\n       Where Octet is any eight-bit\
    \ sequence, representing a prefixed\n       variation number.\n   The first form\
    \ will be construed as equivalent to the second form\n   with the leading string\
    \ \"0/\".  Variation numbers are specified in\n   section 3.3.\n   In all cases,\
    \ the interpretation of what \"company name\" might mean\n   and, in particular,\
    \ what variations of form or spelling,\n   abbreviations, and so on, might be\
    \ accepted is strictly up to the\n   interpretation of the server.  If rules driving\
    \ the server lead to\n   the conclusion that a string matches some company in\
    \ its data, the\n   correctness or incorrectness of that decision is not covered\
    \ by this\n   specification.\n   For variation 0 and, by default, for all others,\
    \ any alphabetic text\n   in lines is to be construed in a case-insensitive fashion.\n"
- title: 3.2 Lines sent from server to client.
  contents:
  - "3.2 Lines sent from server to client.\n   The server is expected to return one\
    \ or more lines to the client,\n   depending on its interpretation of the input\
    \ string.  In general,\n   each line will consist, as described above, of a URL,\
    \ a space, and a\n   \"company name\".  This document deliberately does not specify\
    \ the\n   content or semantics of the \"company name\" string.  It might be a\n\
    \   name, or a name and descriptive information such as location and type\n  \
    \ of business, or other information at the option of the server.  The\n   expectation,\
    \ as mentioned above, is that the information will be\n   displayed by the client\
    \ to aid users in selecting the appropriate\n   URL.\n   These lines, consistent\
    \ with normal Internet practice, will be\n   terminated by a CR LF sequence (rather\
    \ than one or the other of those\n   control characters).\n   When and if different\
    \ variation numbers are introduced, their\n   specifications may include variations\
    \ on what the server is expected\n   to return.\n   In lieu of \"URL and company\
    \ name\" responses, the Server may also\n   return \"error messages\".  These\
    \ take the form of lines containing:\n         \"///\" SP String\n    where the\
    \ String is 7-bit ASCII with no control characters other\n    than SP, unless\
    \ the variation associated with the variation number\n    specifies otherwise.\
    \  For this experiment, all \"error messages\" but\n    the following two are\
    \ discouraged:\n          /// Not found\n                    Indicating that the\
    \ \"company name\" does not match\n                    anything\n          ///\
    \ Variation not supported\n                    Indicating that the variation number\
    \ supplied by the\n                    client is not recognized by the server.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.3.  Registered variations\n   The following two variations are established\
    \ as part of this\n   specification:\n   0/        Query and response are in 7-bit\
    \ ASCII, no controls other\n             than SP, \"Company name\" separated from\

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Why didn't you use <insert-favorite-directory-protocol-here>?\n   Many\
    \ notes raised the question of how much more could be done with a\n   higher-powered\
    \ directory protocol rather than the extremely simple\n   WHOIS.  Questions were\
    \ raised about LDAP, X.500 DAP, CCSO, RWHOIS,\n   and WHOIS++.  We had several\
    \ reasons for avoiding them.  The most\n   important has been a strong commitment\
    \ to see how much can be done\n   with an extremely simplistic approach, and WHOIS\
    \ represented the most\n   simplistic approach we could find.  If it turns out\
    \ to be too simple\n   in practice, things can always evolve to one or more of\
    \ the more\n   advanced protocols.   But, if we started with one of them, we would\n\
    \   never get that information.  Other issues included:\n   * None of the existing\
    \ directory proposals has really emerged as\n     the \"right\" solution with\
    \ a large installed base.  The deployed\n     base of WHOIS and WHOIS clients\
    \ is huge, and using it avoids either\n     having to make a premature choice\
    \ of \"winner\" or to become\n     embroiled in the debate.\n   * For the casual\
    \ user, the mechanisms needed to activate the\n     extensive attribute-based\
    \ directory searches of the stronger\n     protocols are just too complicated\
    \ and may actually act as a\n     deterrent to effective use.\n   * Substantially\
    \ since the dawn of the ARPANET, the Internet\n     experience has been that setting\
    \ up a directory service is easy,\n     but that maintaining one and keeping the\
    \ records up-to-date is\n     extremely difficult.  The economics of operating\
    \ an effective\n     directory service and keeping everything up to date may will\n\
    \     require a revenue-producing product.  Use of a very simple protocol\n  \
    \   for the basic service creates a situation in which basic service\n     can\
    \ rationally be given away while more advanced service are\n     operated on a\
    \ charge or subscription basis.\n"

  - "4.2 And why not use a Web search engine?\n   Web search engines are immensely\
    \ effective and powerful, but address\n   a different problem than this protocol.\
    \  The protocol model here does\n   involve a directory lookup, using a presumed\
    \ company name as a key.\n   The quality of the result will depend on the quality\
    \ of the\n   underlying directory and the editorial and research work that goes\n\
    \   into its construction (neither of which are matters for the protocol\n   itself\
    \ -- we trust that marketplace pressures will separate good\n   servers from poor\
    \ ones).  Web search engines are often more effective\n   at locating information\

  - "5. Thoughts on Directory Providers\n   There is no technical reason why there\

    \ this protocol, nor is\n   there any reason for registries of such providers.\
    \  Presumably,\n   servers that provide the best-quality mappings will eventually\n\
    \   prevail in the marketplace.  However, as with most traditional uses\n   of\

- title: 8. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8. Security Considerations\n   This suggested use of the WHOIS protocol adds\
    \ no significant security\n   risks to those of traditional applications of the\
    \ protocol which is\n   one of the most widely-deployed applications on the Internet.\
    \  As\n   usual, servers should expect to use the string sent to them as an\n\
    \   information retrieval key, not as a function to be executed in some\n   way.\
    \  A more significant risk would arise if the server supporting\n   the translation\
    \ function were somehow spoofed; in that case, an\n   incorrect URL might be returned\
    \ for a particular company. As with the\n   possibility of finding an incorrect\
    \ page using naming conventions,\n   the best protection against the risks that\
    \ could then occur is\n   careful attention to certificates, signatures, and other\n\
    \   authenticity-indicating information.\n"
