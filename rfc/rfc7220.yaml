  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document extends the base PCP [RFC6887] with the ability
    to\n   associate a human-readable description with a PCP-instantiated\n   mapping.
    \ It does this by defining a new DESCRIPTION option.\n   This PCP option can be
    used in simple scenarios with a PCP client and\n   PCP server, as well as in more
    complex scenarios where an\n   interworking function is used to proxy between
    a UPnP IGD Control\n   Point and a PCP server [RFC6970].\n   Querying the PCP
    server to get the description text of an existing\n   mapping is out of scope.\n
    \  The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n
    \  \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n
    \  document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"

    for Opcodes: MAP, PEER\n         Length: Variable,  maximum 1016 octets.\n         May
    appear in: request. May appear in response only if it\n                        appeared

    1: DESCRIPTION Option\n   The 'Reserved' field is initialized as specified in
    Section 7.3 of\n   [RFC6887].\n   The Description field MUST carry UTF-8 encoded
    [RFC3629] description\n   text.  The description text MUST NOT be null terminated.
    \ The length\n   of the description text is indicated by the Length field.  In\n
    \  particular, the description text is not null terminated, and when a\n   client
    or server receives a DESCRIPTION option, it MUST NOT rely on\n   the presence
    of a NUL character in the wire format data to identify\n   the end of the text.\n
    \  This option can be used by a user (or an application) to indicate a\n   description
    associated with a given mapping, such as \"FTP server\",\n   \"My remote access
    to my CP router\", \"Camera\", \"Network attached\n   storage serve\", etc.\n
    \  How the content of the DESCRIPTION option is used is deployment-\n   specific.
    \ For example, the description text can be used by the\n   entity managing the
    PCP server for many purposes, such as the\n   following:\n   o  The description
    text can be used as a hint when cleaning a mapping\n      table by an administrator.\n
    \  o  In some deployments making use of a portal to instruct PCP\n      mappings
    (e.g., Section 5.2 of [PCP-DEPLOY]), the description text\n      can be used to
    store a subscriber identifier.\n"

  - "3.  Behavior\n   Support for the DESCRIPTION option by PCP servers and PCP clients
    is\n   optional.  This option (Code 128; see Figure 1) MAY be included in a\n
    \  PCP MAP/PEER request to associate a description with the requested\n   mapping.\n
    \  A PCP server MAY ignore the DESCRIPTION option sent to it by a PCP\n   client
    (e.g., if it does not support the option or if it is\n   configured to ignore
    it).  To signal that it has not accepted the\n   option, a PCP server simply does
    not include the DESCRIPTION option\n   in the response.  If the PCP client does
    not receive a DESCRIPTION\n   option in a response to a request enclosing a DESCRIPTION
    option,\n   this means the PCP server does not support the option or it is\n   configured
    to ignore it.\n   If the DESCRIPTION option is not included in the PCP client
    request,\n   the PCP server MUST NOT include the DESCRIPTION option in the\n   associated
    response.\n   A PCP server SHOULD be able to store at least 128 bytes for a\n
    \  description.  When the PCP server receives a DESCRIPTION option, it\n   first
    stores the value of the received Description field, truncating\n   it if it cannot
    store the entire value.  The server MUST then send\n   the stored value back to
    the PCP client in the DESCRIPTION option in\n   the response.\n   If the PCP client
    request contains invalid DESCRIPTION options (e.g.,\n   the content is not a legal
    UTF-8 string), the PCP server MUST ignore\n   the request (i.e., MUST NOT return
    a DESCRIPTION option in the\n   response).\n   To update the description text
    of a mapping maintained by a PCP\n   server, the PCP client generates a PCP MAP/PEER
    renewal request that\n   includes a DESCRIPTION option carrying the new description
    text.\n   Upon receipt of the PCP request, the PCP server proceeds to the same\n
    \  operations to validate a MAP/PEER request refreshing an existing\n   mapping.
    \ If validation checks are successfully passed, the PCP\n   server replaces the
    old description text with the new one included in\n   the DESCRIPTION option,
    and the PCP server returns the updated\n   description text in the response, truncated
    (if necessary) as\n   described above.\n   The PCP client uses an empty DESCRIPTION
    option (i.e., Length set to\n   0) to erase the description text associated with
    a mapping.  To\n   indicate that the PCP server has successfully cleared the description\n
    \  text associated with a mapping, the PCP server returns the empty\n   DESCRIPTION
    option in the response.\n"
  title: 3.  Behavior

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   PCP-related security considerations are discussed
    in [RFC6887].  In\n   addition, administrators of PCP servers SHOULD configure
    a maximum\n   description length that does not lead to exhausting storage resources\n
    \  in the PCP server.\n   If the PCP client and the PCP server are not under the
    same\n   administrative entity, the DESCRIPTION option has the potential to\n
    \  leak privacy-related information.  PCP clients should not use the\n   DESCRIPTION
    option for such leakage.  For example, the option should\n   not be used to include
    user identifiers, locations, or names.  Refer\n   to Section 3.2 of [RFC6462]
    for a discussion on information leakage.\n"
