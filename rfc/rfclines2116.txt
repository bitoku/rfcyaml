Abstract This document is a revision to [RFC 1632]:
A Revised Catalog of Available X.500 Implementations and is based on the results of data collection via a WWW home page that enabled implementors to submit new or updated descriptions of currently available implementations of X.500, including commercial products and openly available offerings.
[RFC 1632] is a revision of [RFC 1292].
We contacted each contributor to [RFC 1632] to request an update and published the URL of the WWW home page survey template in several mailing lists to encourage the submission of new product descriptions.
This document contains detailed description of 31 X.500 implementations DSAs, DUAs, and DUA interfaces.
This document catalogs currently available implementations of X.500, including commercial products and openly available offerings.
For the purposes of this survey, we classify X.500 products as, DSA A DSA is an OSI application process that provides the Directory functionality, DUA A DUA is an OSI application process that represents a user in accessing the Directory and uses the DAP to communicate with a DSA, and DUA
Interface A DUA Interface is an application process that  represents a user in accessing the Directory using either DAP but supporting only a  subset of the DAP functionality or a protocol different from DAP to communicate with a  DSA or DUA.
Section 2 of this document contains a listing of implementations cross referenced by keyword.
This list should aid in identifying implementations that meet your criteria.
To compile this catalog, the IDS Working Group solicited input from the X.500 community by publishing a URL for a set of on line description forms deployed on the WWW as a home page on an InterNIC server.
This URL (http://www.internic.net/projects/x500catalog/catalogtop.html) was advertised on the following directory related mailing lists: iso@nic.ddn.mil, isode@nic.ddn.mil, osi ds@cs.ucl.ac.uk, ids@merit.edu, ietf asid@umich.edu, mhs ds@mercury.udev.cdc.com, nadf l@ema.org, and
Readers are encouraged to submit comments regarding both the forms and content of this memo.
Please direct input to the Integrated Directory Services (IDS)
Working Group (ietf ids@umich.edu) or to the authors.
IDS will produce new versions of this document when a significant number of substantive comments have been received or when significant updates and/or modifications to X.500 related standards documents have been ratified.
This will be determined by the IDS chairpersons.
The Internet has experienced a steady growth in X.500 piloting activities.
This document hopes to provide an easily accessible source of information on X.500 implementations for those who wish to consider X.500 technology for deploying a Directory service.
This document contains descriptions of both free and commercial X.500 implementations.
It does not provide instructions on how to install, run, or manage these implementations.
The descriptions and indices are provided to make the readers aware of available options and thus enable more informed choices.
1.3 Disclaimer Implementation descriptions were written by implementors and vendors, and not by the editors.
We worked with the description authors to ensure uniformity and readability, but cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of the descriptions, nor the stability of the implementations.
Overview Section 1 contains introductory information.
Section 2 contains a list of keywords, their definitions, a cross reference of the X.500 implementations by these keywords and a table containing implementor name, implementor abreviation, and the page of this document on which the description begins for a particular implementor.

NAME Critical Angle X.500 Enabler (CAIx500e) ABSTRACT
The X.500 Enabler product allows an LDAP only directory server to be integrated into X.500 environments, by transparently converting X.500 DAP and DSP requests into LDAP requests.
The initial release scheduled for 4Q96 will allow for connections from X.500 capable clients and servers to an LDAP capable server, and will support the following features:   LDAP version 2, as defined in RFC 1777,
all attributes defined for LDAPv2, with the exception of certificates  and revocation lists,   X.500(1988
the X.500(1993) critical extensions field, to aid in deployments incorporating 1993 DSAs.
This release will be available for Solaris 2.5 (SPARC and Intel) and Windows NT
The product is expected to enter a public beta test period in September 1996.
Beta test evaluation copies will be free (limited to two copies per site) but will be set to expire in December 1996.
Released versions of X.500 Enabler will be licensed per server, and will be distributed over the Internet.
(applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)
The X.500 enabler accepts DAP and DSP connections.
It supports Bind (with none or simple credentials), Read, Compare, List, Search, Abandon, AddEntry, ModifyEntry, RemoveEntry and ModifyRDN.
It supports the attributes and object classes defined in X.520 and X.521.
(applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)
The X.500 Enabler will accept connections from X.500(1993) DUAs and DSAs.
Non critical protocol fields which do not map onto LDAPv2 are ignored.
Attribute and object classes from X.520(1993) and X.521(1993) are supported, including collective.
Operational attributes from X.501 are supported, with the exception of subschema.
As LDAPv3 based servers become available, it is expected that the X.500 Enabler will be upgraded to map more of the X.500(1993) protocol onto LDAPv3.
[RFC 1006] is the supported transport service.
The product supports the object classes and attributes defined in RFC 1274.
CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RFCs
The X.500 Enabler is being tested with public domain X.500 and LDAP clients and servers, and with the various X.500 clients and servers connected to the PARADISE project, such as from the ISODE Consortium.
Critical Angle intends to do interoperability testing with commercial LDAP only servers as they become available.
This product will be used to connect LDAP only servers, such as University of Michigan's slapd, and many vendor's forthcoming commercial LDAP server products, into the PARADISE project directory, so that they can be accessed by LDAP and X.500 DUAs throughout the project.
BUGS Bugs reports may be sent to <bug x500e@critical
LIMITATIONS X.509 certificates and revocation lists are not supported due to limitations in the LDAP version 2 protocol.
This restriction will be removed once LDAP version 3 servers become generally available.
Under Windows NT there are limitations on the number of simultaneous incoming connections.
This product supports RFC 1006 for DAP and DSP, and LDAP over TCP.
This product will initially be available for Sun Solaris 2.5 SPARC and Intel, and Windows NT Server 4.0 Intel.
Subsequent versions may be available on additional platforms.
SOFTWARE PLATFORMS An LDAP based server, such as the freely available slapd, is required.
It does not need to run on the same host as the X.500 Enabler.
NUMBER OF IMPLEMENTATIONS IN THE FIELD [No information provided.
This product is licensed per host server, and is distributed over the Internet.
In addition to discounts for large deployment orders, subscription programs permit customers to obtain subsequent update releases at a substantial discount.
Beta test evaluations are free (limited to two copies per site), and will expire 90 days after the start of the beta period.

The CXDUA is a Windows 3.1 DUA that has been derrived from a highly portable and flexible Unix based Administrative Directory User Agent.
The goal of the original design was to support features to assist a directory administrator in managing the directory.
These features include a highly portable GUI, Entry Templates, Entry Lists, Batch Operations and Directory Control Functions.
Both the Windows and the Unix versions support strong authentication.
The Unix DUA has been used in various DMS and NSA pilot projects.

NAME DC X500 Data Connection Ltd 100
Church Street Enfield Middlesex EN2 6BQ UK ABSTRACT DC X500 provides a truly scalable X.500 based enterprise directory server with the necessary architectural flexibility to enable integration with existing database and directory technologies.
From a pure X.500 standpoint, DC X500 provides a full function state of the art DSA implementation.
Architected from scratch according to the 1993 X.500 standards (i.e. not a 1988 DSA with 1993 features grafted on)
Support for all the key X.500 OSI protocols:   Directory Access Protocol (DAP) for user access   Directory System Protocol (DSP) for distributed DSA comunications   Directory Information Shadowing Protocol (DISP) to support replication between servers to give improved performance in a distributed network   Support of the 1993 Basic Access Control and
Simplified Access Control models   Support for the key Internet  X.500 related standards:
integrated Lightweight DAP (LDAP)for DUA access   Madman MIBs for easy integration with SNMP
The DC X500 architecture is based on Data Connection's underlying product architecture which has evolved since 1987 and includes:   genuine multi threaded implementation   true  portability (the product is available on a range of operating systems e.g Windows NT, AIX, HP UX.
and it is possible to port the core  technology to any hardware/software platform)
secure service recording for operation tracking and billing   support for system monitoring (both alarms and statistics)
Key product features include:   Name resolution and integrated use of Search Indices based on 2 3 trees leads to high performance operation evaluation (subsecond response times on  million entry DSAs)
Generic schema support based on 1993 concepts that allows customers to tailor the schema to meet their precise data structuing requirements
System recycle time is minimised (e.g. DC X500 can be backed up while running and  search indices are dynamically updated), helping achieve the goal of continuous (24x7) availability and high reliability.
No artificial software constraints are imposed resulting in a truly scalable product assuming the availability of the necessary hardware DC X500 can be configured  to support millions of entries in a single DSA.
DC X500 is certified for used within the Paradise Pilot project.
The product has also undergone interoperability testing at the EuroSInet interoperability workshops in Europe.

NAME DE ABSTRACT DE (Directory Enquiries) is intended to be a simple to use DUA interface, suitable for the naive user, and suitable for running as a public access dua.
it will work on any terminal.
The user is presented with a series of (verbose) prompts asking for person's name department organization  country.
There is extensive on line help.
The matching algorithms are such that near matches are presented to the user before less good matches.
There have been a few minor enhancements since the description in [RFC 1632].
The power searching feature still sets DE apart from most other DUAs this allows a user to search for an entry even when they do not know the name of the organisation in which the person works you still have to specify the country.
DE also allows UFN style searching.
DE uses slightly different search algorithms depending on whether it is accessing part of the Directory mastered by a Quipu DSA Quipu DSAs
tend to use lots of replication and so encourage searching.
DE incorporates a QOS feature where it maintains a database of past information availability and DSA responsiveness.
Translations exist into at least 4 different languages.
DE runs over ISODE DAP and University of Michigan LDAP.
There is a version of DE, called DOS DE, which has been ported to DOS, and this uses LDAP.
DE was funded by the COSINE PARADISE project, and DE is used as the PARADISE public access dua.
You can test the software by telnet to directory.ja.net and logging in as dua

V2.0 Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG ABSTRACT DIR.X SYNC
V2.0 enables the synchronization of existing e mail address directories in the X.500 based DIR.X directory service.
The standard DIR.X, DIR.X SYNC and DIR.D (all available from Siemens Nixdorf) products are the foundations on which the corporate directory solutions can be tailored to meet the customer's needs.
The corporate directory then becomes the universal information system within the company.
The user can access corporate directory information in different ways:   Using DIR.D, SNI's Windows client for the X.500 service, PC users can gain easy access to the DIR.X server containing the corporate directory data.
The data found can  be transferred to other applications by means of DDE, drag and drop or cut and paste.
(See DIR.D V2.6 for further information).
: Authorized users can access data stored in the central or distributed directory system over their own mail system.
DIR.X SYNC retrieves the inquiry transmitted by mail and directs it on to the X.500 service.
The search results are then delivered back to the user by mail.
Using a WWW interface based on TCL scripts Query by mail does not require additional software on the end system.
Each mail system connected to the X.400 backbone (e.g. MS Mail, cc:
DIR.X SYNC currently supports the address formats of the following e mail systems:
Mail   Intelligent Messaging Mail (Banyan)
The standardized ISO 10021 interface for X.400 addresses is supported, enabling need for extension.
This means that any type of system capable of generating this format (e.g. WordPerfect, Lotus Notes) can be connected.
Address acknowledgment is carried out in ISO format.
Export: Addresses can be exported from local directories.
They are delivered as mail messages in ASCII format to the DIR.X SYNC server.
The upload server stores the exported local addresses in DIR.X as globally valid X.400 addresses.
DIR.X SYNC enables mail members to send a search to the DIR.X SYNC server by e mail.
Using this function, authorized administrators of the synchronized directories can acquire copies of the corporate directory data.
Administration of the DIR.X SYNC server with an administration tool which can be used via command line or a command file.
Other features include:   Replication and distribution:
In addition to the central solution with a single corporate directory server, DIR.X SYNC also supports replicated or distributed data storage in DIR.X SYNC server.
Authentication/Authorization: To prevent unauthorized use of the corporate directory system, the O/R addresses of the authorized administrators and users are configured by the DIR.X SYNC administrator.
When a query by mail or an update arrives, the sender address is compared with this address.
: In the case of error, e.g. incorrect file format, the sender (and the administrator  configurable) are informed of the fault by mail.
At the same time, the error message is saved in a log file for the DIR.X SYNC administrator.
In addition, a "history  file" enables the monitoring of the uploads that have run or are currently running COMPLIANCE with X.500 1988 (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

Characteristics of the DSA are:
The DAP and DSP protocols are provided conformant with X.500 (88).
The DIB is maintained in ASN.1 encoded format in the Unix file system.
Utilities are provided to load and dump the DIB from and to ASCII text files.
As an option, an ORACLE V7 database can also be used.
The DIT structure is held in main memory.
Frequently used attributes may be held in inverted tables in memory to speed up searches.
knowledge on managed domains is stored in Forum LOOK'UP specific attributes of the DSA entries.
The X.500 (88), X.400 (88) and most of the Cosine and Internet Schema are supported.
Object class and attribute definitions are enforced.
Users may define their own.
Simple authentication is provided strong authentication and signed operations have been tested operationally through Telis's participation in PASSWORD, a VALUE project with aim to pilot a European security infrastructure for network applications.
Access control : the DSA offers a mechanism defined by Telis that is functionally equivalent to a profile of the X500 '93 access control mechanism.
The mechanism is based on the notion of administrative domains (autonomous and semi  autonomous).
A domain defines the user groups (categories) and their access rights (consult, modify) to specified attribute types.
The access rights are defined in prescriptive and entry ACI attributes.
Approximate (phonetic) searches will then be carried out in the given language.
The software loads a rule database to which new languages and new rules may be added easily.
Management: a Forum LOOK'UP DSA object has been defined to allow operational parameters of the DSA to be managed via DAP.
The GUI includes a "dashboard" for monitoring of servers and the hardware they are installed on.
The DUAs include a graphical directory browser with powerful search functionality for PCs and Macintosh.

The current recommended maximum for the proprietary database (based on the Unix file system) is a database size of the order of 100,000 objects.
For a larger database one unique server (up to 300,000 objects), the use of the Oracle database is recommended   Of the selected attribute types defined in X.500 (88), the searchGuide attribute is not supported
neither are the following attributes from the Cosine and Internet Schema [RFC 1274]:
OtherMailbox, MailPreferenceOption and the various quality attributes.
INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT Forum LOOK'UP includes a transport stack for TP0 with TCP/IP [RFC 1006] and X.25.
The stack has been ported to SunNet OSI for TP4 with CLNP.
(Novell Netware, Microsoft Lan Manager, IBM Lan Server) can access the DSA without the need for IP on every Workstation.
A module (called SOLO server) available on Novell, OS/2 and UNIX allows to have an IP or X.25 stack only on the file server.
It is in charge of forwarding the request to a DSA.
A direct access (DUA / DSA) through IP, X.25, PSTN or ISDN is also available.
HARDWARE PLATFORMS Forum LOOK'UP can easily be ported to any UNIX machine.
It currently runs on: Sun Solaris and Hewlett Packard.
A port on IBM AIX is to be completed.
The Forum LOOK'UP server is portable to any UNIX like operating system.
X/Motif is the interface used for management.
The DUAs are available on Windows and Macintosh.
ORACLE V7 can be used as a database (option).
NUMBER OF IMPLEMENTATIONS IN THE FIELD 30 servers AVAILABILITY Forum LOOK'UP is commercially available.

NAME FX 500 Firefox International Limited ABSTRACT FX 500 is a core component of Firefoxs product suite for mail, messaging and directories.
FX 500 provides a Directory System Agent (DSA) which adheres to the latest 1993 X.500 standards.
FX 500 may be used in conjunction with the Firefox FX 400 messaging products or may be combined with a range of Directory User Agent and Gateway products in order to satisfy a broad range of directory requirements.
FX 500 affords unique integration opportunities with Novell's NetWare Directory Service (NDS) by offering the option of true dynamic directory integration between NDS and X.500.
FX 500 provides support for key features of the X.500 1993 standard while continuing to support interworking with 1988 based directory user agents and system agents.
The main 1993 features of X.500 supported by FX 500 are:   Basic Access Control
The 1993 DSA Information Model   Replication and Shadowing In summary
, FX 500 supports:   1988 and 1993
X.500 Directory Access Protocol (DAP)   1988 and 1993 X.500 Directory System Protocol (DSP)
1993 X.500 Directory Information Shadowing Protocol (DISP)   1993
the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), as defined by [RFC 1777]   configuration of knowledge information for distributed operation using 1993 operational attributes   local management services, including a knowledge configuration application and extensive diagnostic facilities   an extended set of management applications   operation in a wide variety of network environments including connectivity over X.25, TCP/IP [RFC 1006] and OSI LANs.
The optional application developer's toolkit includes:   the X/Open Directory Services (XDS) API to support directory user agent applications
a Gateway (G XDS) API which is based on a simplified version of the XDS API syntax and allows developers to implement gateways to existing/ proprietary directory databases   a Network Management Interface (NMI) to support management applications and integration with management services.
FX 500 is delivered with a schema defined to support the Common Use and MHS (X.402)
Schemas defined by UK GOSIP V4.
The subschema for FX 500 can be modified by the customer and updated dynamically.
FX 500 provides for search optimisation by supporting keyed search whereby specific attributes can be identified as 'keyed' through local configuration data.
This optimisation avoids the need to do a "brute force" search which requires a traversal of all the nodes of a subtree.
Approximate match search filters are also supported by using a phonetic search based on the "Soundex" algorithm.
(applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)
FX 500 meets both the static and dynamic requirements implied by section 9.2 of X.519 1988.
From section 9.2 of X.519 1988 regarding DSA conformance:   FX 500 supports both the directoryAccessAC and directorySystemAC application contexts.
The FX 500 DSA can act as a first level DSA
The chained mode of operation is supported.

NAME ISODE Consortium Release 3.0 X.500(1993)
Directory ISODE Consortium Ltd. ABSTRACT
This implementation is a source release of an X.500(1993) Directory System Agent (DSA).
It has been designed an implemented as an X.500 1993 DSA not as a 1988 DSA with '93 extensions.
Emphasis has been placed on providing support for a flexible information model, access control, X.509 security features, and standard replication.
The 1993 DSA offers a strong technical foundation on which to build an information and messaging infrastructure that relies on robust and scalable directory services.
The implementation of this DSA incorporates the experience gained through the development, support, and maintenance of the earlier QUIPU, as well as operational experience and standards support.
(applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)
The DSA is aligned to the 1988 ISO IS and the NIST OIW Directory Implementors Guide Version 1. X.500(1993) features such as replication, access control, as well as X.509 certification are also available.
Interoperability testing with other DSAs has been performed.

NAME LDAP University of Michigan ABSTRACT UM LDAP is an implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.
LDAP is a draft Internet standard directory service protocol that runs over TCP/IP.
It can be used to provide a stand  alone directory service, or to provide lightweight access to the X.500 directory.
LDAP is defined by [RFC 1777] and [RFC 1778].
The UM LDAP package includes the following components:
a stand alone LDAP directory server   slurpd a stand alone
ldapd an LDAP to X.500 gateway server   centipede
an LDAP centroid generation and maintenance program   libldap an LDAP client library   liblber a lightweight BER/DER encoding/decoding library   ldif tools data conversion tools for use with slapd   in.xfingerd a finger to LDAP gateway server   go500 a gopher to LDAP gateway server for searching   go500gw a gopher to LDAP gateway server for searching and browsing
an email to LDAP query responder   mail500 an LDAP capable mailer
an LDAP capable mailer that supports remote printing
LDAP tools A collection of shell based LDAP utility programs
In addition, there are some contributed components:
an HTTP to LDAP gateway
a WHOIS to LDAP gateway   saucer a simple command line oriented client program
The latest information about LDAP can always be found on the LDAP Home Page at this URL:
http://www.umich.edu/~rsug/ldap/ COMPLIANCE with X.500 1988
(applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)
The U M LDAP distribution is a complete implementation of the LDAP protocol.
The LDAP protocol does not support access to all X.500 features and operations.
The operations supported are bind, search, compare, add, delete, modify, modify RDN, and abandon.
Note that read and list operations can be emulated using the search operation.
Size and time limits may be specified, as may alias dereferencing and searching, but all X.500 service controls are not supported.
(applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)
Since the LDAP protocol itself has not yet been updated to support any 1993 specific X.500 features, this implementation does support any 1993 features yet either.
PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS Believed to be compliant with: [RFC 1274], [RFC 1777], [RFC 1778], [RFC 1779], [RFC 1781] CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RFCs Includes an implementation of the LDAP API, as defined in [RFC 1823].
Search filters used within UM LDAP comply with [RFC 1558].
The current implementation of the X.500 backended LDAP server (ldapd) is known to work with ISODE based DAP libraries and the QUIPU DSA.
PILOT CONNECTIVITY DUA connectivity should be possible to all pilots.
BUGS Bug reports should be sent to bug ldap@umich.edu.
LIMITATIONS None, aside from those mentioned above under completeness.
INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT LDAP clients use TCP to communicate with the LDAP server.
The LDAP server normally uses [RFC 1006] with TCP/IP to communicate with the DSA, though any other transport mechanism for DSA communication supported by ISODE should be possible.
The complete UM LDAP package has been ported to a wide variety of UNIX systems, including: Sun3 and SPARCs running SunOS 4.1.x or Solaris 2.x, DECStations running Ultrix 4.3, HP 9000 series running HP UX 9.05, IBM RS6000 running AIX 3.2.5, PCs running SCO, FreeBSD, NetBSD, or LINUX, DEC Alphas running OSF/1, and NeXTStatios running NeXTSTEP 3.2.
The complete package has also been ported to VMS.
In addition, the LDAP client libraries and some client programs have been ported to Apple Macintosh and PCs running MSDOS or Windows.

NAME PMDF X500 from: Innosoft International, Inc. 1050
91790 Phone:   1 818 919 3600 email:
ABSTRACT PMDF X500 is Innosoft's implementation of the X.500 standards for Directory Services.
PMDF X500 is based upon the ISODE Consortium code base.
The core of PMDF X500 is the Directory System Agent (DSA) server.
This server provides directory information to Directory User Agents (DUA) using either OSI or TCP/IP networking protocols.
Since PMDF X500 is based on a widely used implementation, it interoperates particularly well with a whole host of X.500 based products from other sources.
In order to facilitate initial loading of directory data as well as ongoing coordination with other directory services, PMDF X500 includes tools to import from and export directory information to Entry Description File (EDF) files.
EDF files are flat text files.
PMDF X500 provides directory coordination functions using EDF files for the following directories:   X.500 DSAs supporting LDAP access
PMDF  generic databases COMPLIANCE with X.500 1988
(applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)
OSI directory services as specified in CCITT X.500 Recommendations and ISO 9594 use the Directory Access Protocol (DAP) and the Directory System Protocol (DSP).
(applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)
PMDF X500 does not yet support the 1993 changes to the X.500 standard.
Support for the 1993 X.500 recommendations is planned for a future release of PMDF X500.
PMDF X500 supports DAP and DSP accesses using Internet protocols as specified in [RFC 1006].
In addition, the Internet community has proposed two lightweight alternatives to DAP called Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), which is specified in [RFC 1777], and Connectionless Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (CLDAP), which is specified in [RFC 1798].
LDAP and CLDAP, which are currently specified to run over TCP/IP, are much simpler protocols than DAP and were designed to reduce the cost of entry associated with using X.500 protocols in client applications.
PMDF X500 includes both LDAP and CLDAP servers.
The LDAP server accesses X.500 directory information using DAP to communicate with X.500 DSAs.
PMDF X500 provides an LDAP server which translates LDAP requests into DAP requests to communicate with X.500 DSAs.
CLDAP defines a very low overhead method for accessing X.500 directory information.
CLDAP is suitable for providing access to information that does not require access controls.
CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RFCs
INTEROPERABILITY PMDF X500 interoperates with a large number of DUAs and DSAs.
This is demonstated by the fact that PMDF X500 is DSA used by several Internet White Pages Project participants.
PMDF X500 DSA interoperability includes at least all of the DSA that are used in the White Pages Project.
PMDF X500 is delivered with several DUAs and in addition is know to support the DUAs from Unisys and Digital Equipment Corporation as well as the publically available DUAs MaX500, Cello, Swix, and the NASA DUA.
PMDF X500 is used by several sites that are participants of the Internet White Pages Project include the Innosoft DSA.
CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS [
INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT DAP and DSP are layered on top of the OSI protocol suite.
PMDF X500 supports this protocol suite over multiple network transports.
For a pure OSI protocol stack, DECnet/OSI can be used to provide the lower layers of the stack.
In addition, PMDF X500 supports running OSI upper layer protocols over a TCP/IP transport in accordance with [RFC 1006].
It is important to note that while [RFC 1006] specifies TCP/IP as a transport, all of the OSI upper layer protocols are always used with DAP and DSP.

DATE LAST UPDATED or CHECKED 13 Dec 1995 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION and/or
NAME X500 DS X500 DUA Bull S.A. ABSTRACT X500 DS and X500 DUA are integral part of the large Bull OSI offer.
Although based on the DCE/GDS (Distributed Computing Environment/Global Directory Service) of OSF, those two products may be installed and used without the DCE environment.
Some enhancements have been added for the user and the management facilities.
X500 DS is designed to implement both the DUA and the DSA functions, whilst X500 DUA only provides the DUA functions.
The X500 DUA package contains:
The interface with the low layers is XTI.
[RFC 1006] is supported under XTI or the OSI Session,   A DUA Cache to improve performances when accessing remote DSAs,   A powerful management application facilitating the configuration of the product and controlling the operations, logs and traces,   A user application for the manipulations of the database entries,   A generic tool to load and unload ASCII and binary files in/from distributed DSAs,
The support of the LDAP [RFC 1777] thanks to an LDAP Server,   A DUA Server that allows to use A Window To Directory (refer to this DUA product description) on a PC.
The X500 DS package contains:
All components of the X500 DUA,   A core DSA to process all requests received from distant DUAs through DAP protocol or from distant DSAs through DSP protocol,
The support of the referral, chained and multi casting modes of operation, access control lists and management of knowledge information (for distribution, shadows and  copies of sub trees),
The support of the simple authentication and of the DCE authentication,   A management application for managing the schema information (creation, deletion and modification of object classes and of attribute types, management of the rules of the DIT).
A C ISAM database that is specially designed for high performances: e.g. less than 10 ms to read an entry on an Escala at the XOM/XDS interface.
These two products are easely installed, configured and administered thanks to the System Management Interface Tool (SMIT) screens of AIX.
(applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)
Compliant with EWOS and OIW Agreements
Consists of both DUA and DSA implementation according to the '88 CCITT X.500 and ISO 9594 standard.
The X/Open standard XDS and XOM interface libraries are also provided.
When the product is installed with the DCE environment, XDS and XOM interfaces are also used to access DCE/CDS (Local Cell Directory Service) transparently.
A GDA (Global Directory Agent) serves then as the gateway between the DCE CDS and GDS.
(applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)
INTERNET STANDARDS Supports [RFC 1277], [RFC 1777].
CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RFCs
This implementation of DAP and DSP can interoperate with other X.500 implementations from other Cebit and EUROSINET demo participants including IBM, HP, ICL, Siemens Nixdorf, SUN, Marben, NEXOR, etc.
It also interoperates with ISODE QUIPU.
BUGS Bull S.A. provides complete software maintenance with the products.
CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS [
INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT OSI TP4 with CLNP (WAN LAN) OSI TP0, 2 & 4 with X.25 (WAN)
[RFC 1006] with TCP/IP Either BSD sockets or XTI can be used to access the transports.
Through XTI, both OSI and TCP/IP protocols are possible on the same machine, thus permitting to build a Directory Service distributed on OSI and TCP/IP networks.
