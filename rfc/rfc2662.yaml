    on the\n   ADSL Forum standard data model [9].  The ADSL standard describes\n
    \  ATU-C and ATU-R as two sides of the ADSL line.  This MIB covers both\n   ATU-C
    and ATU-R agent's perspectives.  Each instance defined in the\n   MIB represents
    a single ADSL line.\n   It should be noted that the ADSL Forum Network Management
    Working\n   Group provided input towards the content of this document.  See the\n
    \  Acknowledgement Section for a list of individuals who made this\n   document

  title: 1.  Abstract
- contents:
  - "2.  The SNMP Network Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently
    consists of five major\n   components:\n   o  An overall architecture, described
    in RFC 2571 [13].\n   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events
    for the\n      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of\n
    \     Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD\n      16,
    RFC 1155 [14], STD 16, RFC 1212 [15] and RFC 1215 [16].  The\n      second version,
    called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578\n      [1], STD 58, RFC 2579 [2]
    and STD 58, RFC 2580 [17].\n   o  Message protocols for transferring management
    information.  The\n      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called
    SNMPv1 and\n      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [7].  A second version of the
    SNMP\n      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track\n      protocol,
    is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [18] and RFC\n      1906 [19].  The
    third version of the message protocol is called\n      SNMPv3 and described in
    RFC 1906 [19], RFC 2572 [20] and RFC 2574\n      [21].\n   o  Protocol operations
    for accessing management information.  The\n      first set of protocol operations
    and associated PDU formats is\n      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [7].  A second
    set of protocol\n      operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC
    1905\n      [8].\n   o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
    [22] and\n      the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575\n
    \     [23].\n   This document specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the
    SMIv2.\n   A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate\n
    \  translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically\n   equivalent,
    except where objects or events are omitted because no\n   translation is possible
    (e.g., use of Counter64).  Some machine\n   readable information in SMIv2 will
    be converted into textual\n   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
    \ However, this\n   loss of machine readable information is not considered to
    change the\n   semantics of the MIB.\n"

  - "3.  Object Definitions\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
    store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB
    are\n   defined using the extended subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One\n   (ASN.1)
    defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named\n   by an OBJECT
    IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The\n   object type together with
    an object instance serves to uniquely\n   identify a specific instantiation of
    the object.  For human\n   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed
    the descriptor, to\n   also refer to the object type.\n"

    - "4.1  Use of the IfTable\n   The ADSL LINE MIB specifies the detailed attributes
      of a data\n   interface.  As such, it needs to integrate with IF-MIB [5].  The
      IANA\n   has assigned the following ifType(s) relative to ADSL:\n       IANAifType
      ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION\n           . . .\n       SYNTAX INTEGER {\n                .

      of each of these types are modeled by this document.  Most\n   MIB tables in

    - "4.2  Relationship with RFC 2037 [25]\n   Implementation of the Entity MIB [25]
      is optional.  It in no way\n   alters the information required in the adslLineMib,
      nor does it alter\n   the relationship with IF-MIB.\n   The Entity MIB introduces
      a standardized way of presenting the\n   components of complex systems, such
      as a Digital Subscriber Line\n   Access Multiplexer (DSLAM), that may contain
      multiple racks, shelves,\n   line cards, and/or ports.   The Entity MIB's main
      goal is to present\n   these system components, their containment relationship,
      and mapping\n   information with other MIBs such as the Interface MIB and the\n
      \  adslLineMib.\n   If ATU-C agent is implemented, the Entity MIB should include
      entities\n   for the ATU-C in the entPhysicalTable.  The MIB's\n   entAliasMappingTable
      would contain mapping information identifying\n   the 'ifIndex' object associated
      with each ATU-C.  However, if ATU-R\n   agent is implemented, the Entity MIB
      should include entities for the\n   ATU-R in the entPhysicalTable.  In this
      case, the MIB's\n   entAliasMappingTable would  contain mapping information
      identifying\n   the 'ifIndex' object associated with each ATU-R.\n   Also associating
      the relationship between the ifTable and Entity MIB,\n   the entPhysicalTable
      contains an 'entPhysicalName' object, which\n   approximates the semantics of
      the 'ifName' object from the Interface\n   MIB.\n"

    - "5.1  Naming Conventions\n   A. Atuc/Atur are used for the ATU-C and ATU-R.
      \ In other RFCs, these\n      are sometimes referred to as the Near End (Ne)
      and Far End (Fe)\n      respectively, but not in this document.\n   B. The terms,
      \"transmit\" and \"receive\", are from the perspective of\n      the corresponding
      table's end of the line.  For example, in the\n      case of Fast channels,
      adslAtucChanConfFastMaxTxRate defines the\n      \"downstream\" rate, while
      adslAturChanConfFastMaxTxRate defines the\n      \"upstream\" rate for a particular
      channel.\n   C. There are two possible channels: fast, and interleaved.  None,
      one\n      or both may be implemented on a particular ADSL Line.  Figure 5\n
      \     illustrates all possible operational configurations.\n   D. Lof, Lol,
      Los, Lpr mean Loss of Framing, Link, Signal, and Power,\n      respectively.
      \ Lpr is used by T1E1, so it is used for consistency\n      (rather than Lop).\n
      \     A Loss of Link condition is declared at the ATU-C if a Loss of\n      Signal
      is not preceded by a `dying-gasp' message from the ATU-R.\n      Note that Loss
      of Link is only supported by the ATU-C.\n   E. ES means errored second. An Errored
      Second is any second\n      containing one or more CRC anomaly, or one or more
      Los(s) or\n      Severely Errored Frame (Sef) defect(s).\n   F. A \"block\"
      is a physical-layer `data buffer' over which CRCs are\n      calculated.  For
      example, in DMT, the block is defined as the ADSL\n      superframe.  The block
      duration is 250 micro-seconds so the block\n      length in bytes, as defined
      in adslAtu*ChanCrcBlockLength, varies\n      with data rate.  See Line Code
      Specific MIBs [11] [12] for more\n      line code specific information.\n   G.
      Atn means Attenuation, Psd is Power Spectral Density and Snr is\n      Signal
      to Noise Ratio.\n   H. LCS means line code specific, e.g.,\n      o DMT = Discrete
      MultiTone\n      o CAP = Carrierless Amplitude and Phase modulation and\n      o
      QAM = Quadrature Amplitude Modulation\n   I. Vendor (in the Inventory objects)
      refers to the manufacturer of\n      the ATU-C or ATU-R assembly, not the modem
      chip vendor. When in\n      doubt, use the manufacturer of the smallest field
      replaceable unit\n      (e.g., stand-alone modem box, plug-in board).\n   J.

        \  [13]).\n   One or more ADSL lines may be configured to share parameters

    - "5.5  Traps\n   These SNMP traps are required: coldStart / warmStart (per [6])
      --\n   which are per agent (e.g., per DSLAM in such a device), and linkUp /\n
      \  linkDown (per [5]) -- which are per interface (i.e., ADSL line).\n   Note:
      RFC 2233 [5] recommends that linkUp / linkDown only be used at\n   a physical-layer
      ifEntry, as discussed above.\n   A linkDown trap is generated whenever any of
      Lof, Los, Lol, Loss of\n   Signal Quality, or Lpr events occurs.  At this operational
      point, a\n   manager can use adslAtu*CurrStatus for additional detailed\n   information.
      The corresponding linkUp trap is sent when all link\n   failure conditions are
      cleared.\n   The traps defined in this MIB are for initialization failure, rate\n
      \  change, and for the threshold crossings associated with the following\n   events:
      Lofs, Lols, Loss, Lprs, and ESs.  Each threshold has its own\n   enable/threshold
      value. When that value is 0, the trap is disabled.\n   The current status objects
      (adslAtu*CurrStatus) indicate, through a\n   bitmask, all outstanding error
      conditions or that the line is\n   operational.  Note that each object claims
      to represent the status of\n   the modem at that end of the line.  However,
      since the SNMP agent\n   likely co-resides with only one end of the line, the
      corresponding\n   far-end current status object may be incomplete. For example,
      when\n   there are errors on the line, the far-end ATU may not be able to\n
      \  correctly report this condition. Therefore, not all conditions are\n   included
      in its current status.\n   A threshold trap occurs whenever the corresponding
      current 15-minute\n   interval error counter becomes equal and/or exceeds to
      the threshold\n   value.  One trap will be sent per interval per interface.
      Since the\n   current 15-minute counter are reset to 0 every 15 minutes, if
      the\n   condition persists, the trap may recur as often as every 15 minutes.\n
      \  For example, to get a trap whenever a \"loss of\" event occurs (but at\n
      \  most once every 15 minutes), set the corresponding \"Thresh15Min\" to\n   1.
      \ The agent will generate a trap when the event originally occurs.\n   Note
      that the NMS will get a linkDown trap, as well, if enabled.  At\n   the beginning
      of the next 15 minute interval, the counter is reset.\n   When the first second
      goes by and the event occurs, the current\n   interval bucket will be 1, which
      equals the threshold and the trap\n   will be sent again.\n   The rate change
      trap is invoked when the transmit rate on a channel\n   either increases by
      adsl(x)Thresh(y)RateUp or decreases by\n   adsl(x)Thresh(y)RateDown. The trap
      is per direction:(x) == Atuc or\n   Atur, and per channel: (y) == Fast or Interleave.
      In other words, the\n   trap is sent whenever the rate changes in either direction
      on either\n   channel and:\n                CurrTxRate >= PrevTxRate plus ThreshRateUp\n
      \                                   or\n               CurrTxRate <= PrevTxRate
      minus ThreshRateDown\n   No trap is sent on initialization.\n   It can be disabled
      by setting the Up (and/or) Down threshold rates to\n   0.\n   The PrevTxRate
      object is set to the current value at initialization\n   and when a trap is
      sent.  Thus rate changes are cumulative until the\n   total change reaches the
      threshold.\n"

    has\n       an entry in an ifTable which may include multiple modem lines.\n       An
    agent may reside at either end of the ADSL line however the\n       MIB is designed

    in the low-level ADSL line protocol.\n       The agent may monitor and control
    this protocol for its needs.\n       ADSL lines may support optional Fast or Interleaved
    channels.\n       If these are supported, additional entries corresponding to

    \      line that supports both channels will have three entries in the\n       ifTable,

  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   1) Blocking unauthorized access to the ADSL
    MIB via the element\n   management system is outside the scope of this document.
    It should be\n   noted that access to the MIB permits the unauthorized entity
    to\n   modify the profiles (sect 6.4) such that both subscriber service and\n
    \  network operations can be interfered with. Subscriber service can be\n   altered
    by modifying any of a number of service characteristics such\n   as rate partitioning
    and maximum transmission rates. Network\n   operations can be impacted by modification
    of trap thresholds such as\n   SNR margins.\n   2) There are a number of managed
    objects in this MIB that may be\n   considered to contain sensitive information.
    \ In particular, the\n   certain objects may be considered sensitive in many environments,\n
    \  since it would allow an intruder to obtain information about which\n   vendor's
    equipment is in use on the network.  Therefore, it may be\n   important in some
    environments to control read access to these\n   objects and possibly to even
    encrypt the values of these object when\n   sending them over the network via
    SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP\n   provide features for such a secure environment.\n
    \  SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the\n   network
    itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,\n   there is no control
    as to who on the secure network is allowed to\n   access and GET (read) the objects
    in this MIB.  It is recommended\n   that the implementors consider the security
    features as provided by\n   the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the
    User-based\n   Security Model RFC 2574 [21] and the View-based Access Control
    Model\n   RFC 2575 [23] is recommended.\n   It is then a customer/user responsibility
    to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is
    properly\n   configured to give access to those objects only to those principals\n
    \  (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.\n   3) ADSL layer connectivity
    from the ATU-R will permit the subscriber\n   to manipulate both the ADSL link
    directly and the AOC/EOC channels\n   for their own loop.  For example,  unchecked
    or unfiltered\n   fluctuations initiated by the subscriber could generate sufficient\n
    \  traps to potentially overwhelm either the management interface to the\n   network
    or the element manager.  Other attacks affecting the ATU-R\n   portions of the
    MIB may also be possible.\n   11. Intellectual Property Notice\n   The IETF takes
