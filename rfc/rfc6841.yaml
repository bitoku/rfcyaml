- title: 1.1.  Background
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Background\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) was not originally designed\
    \ with strong\n   security mechanisms to provide integrity and authenticity of\
    \ its\n   data.  Over the years, a number of vulnerabilities have been\n   discovered\
    \ that threaten the reliability and trustworthiness of the\n   system.\n   The\
    \ Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC, [RFC4033],\n   [RFC4034], [RFC4035])\
    \ address these vulnerabilities by using public\n   key cryptography to add data\
    \ origin authentication, data integrity\n   verification, and authenticated denial-of-existence\
    \ capabilities to\n   the DNS.  In short, DNSSEC provides a way for software to\
    \ verify the\n   origin of DNS data and validate that it has not been modified\
    \ in\n   transit or by intermediaries.\n   To provide a means for stakeholders\
    \ to evaluate the strength and\n   security of the DNSSEC chain of trust, an entity\
    \ operating a DNSSEC-\n   enabled zone may publish a DNSSEC Practice Statement\
    \ (DPS),\n   comprising statements describing critical security controls and\n\
    \   procedures relevant for scrutinizing the trustworthiness of the\n   system.\
    \  The DPS may also identify any of the DNSSEC Policies (DPs)\n   it supports,\
    \ explaining how it meets their requirements.\n   The DP and DPS are not primarily\
    \ aimed at users who rely on signed\n   responses from the DNS (\"relying parties\"\
    ); instead, their audience\n   is other stakeholders of the DNS infrastructure,\
    \ a group that may\n   include bodies such as regulatory authorities.\n   Even\
    \ though this document is heavily inspired by the \"Internet X.509\n   Public\
    \ Key Infrastructure Certificate Policy and Certification\n   Practices Framework\"\
    \ [RFC3647], with large parts being drawn from\n   that document, the properties\
    \ and structure of the DNSSEC trust model\n   are fundamentally different from\
    \ those of the X.509 Public Key\n   Infrastructure (PKI).\n"
- title: 1.2.  Purpose
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Purpose\n   The purpose of this document is twofold.  Firstly, the document\n\
    \   explains the concepts of a DNSSEC Policy (DP) and of a DNSSEC\n   Practice\
    \ Statement (DPS), and it describes the relationship between\n   the two.  Secondly,\
    \ it presents a framework to encourage and assist\n   writers of Policies and\
    \ Practice Statements in creating consistent\n   and comparable documents.  In\
    \ particular, the framework identifies\n   the elements that should be considered\
    \ in formulating a DP or a DPS.\n   It does not, however, define a particular\
    \ Policy or Practice\n   Statement, nor does it seek to provide legal advice or\n\
    \   recommendations as to the contents.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Scope
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Scope\n   The scope of this document is limited to discussion of the topics\n\
    \   that can be covered in a DP or a DPS, but it does not go into the\n   specific\
    \ details that could possibly be included in either a DP or a\n   DPS.  In particular,\
    \ this document describes the types of information\n   that should be considered\
    \ for inclusion in them.\n   This framework should be viewed and used as a checklist\
    \ of factors\n   that ought be taken into consideration prior to deploying DNSSEC,\
    \ and\n   as an outline to create an operational practices disclosure document.\n\
    \   As such, it focuses on the topics affected by the introduction of\n   DNSSEC\
    \ into a zone.  Other aspects, such as the operations of name\n   servers and\
    \ registry systems, are considered out of scope.  The\n   framework is primarily\
    \ aimed at Top-Level Domain (TLD) managers and\n   organizations providing registry\
    \ services, but it may be used by\n   high-value domain holders and so serve as\
    \ a checklist for DNSSEC\n   readiness at a high level.\n   This document assumes\
    \ that the reader is familiar with the general\n   concepts of DNS, DNSSEC, and\
    \ PKI.\n"
- title: 2.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.  Definitions\n   This document makes use of the following defined terms:\n\
    \   Audit logs:  Control evidence information to prove the integrity of\n    \
    \  processes.  This may be generated by DNS and DNSSEC-related\n      systems,\
    \ supplied by the surrounding facility, or obtained from\n      manually generated,\
    \ non-electronic documentation.  Audit logs will\n      be examined by the internal\
    \ and/or external auditors.\n   Activation data:  Data values, other than keys,\
    \ required to operate\n      the cryptographic modules used to protect the keys\
    \ from\n      unauthorized use.\n   Chain of trust:  A hierarchical structure\
    \ of trust consisting of DNS\n      keys, signatures, and delegation signer records\
    \ that, when\n      validated in a series, can provide proof of authenticity of\
    \ the\n      last element in the chain, providing that the first element is\n\
    \      trusted.  Usually, the first element is a trust anchor.\n   Compromise\
    \ (key compromise):  Key compromise is a situation where the\n      private component\
    \ of a signing key is lost, stolen, exposed,\n      modified, or used in an unauthorized\
    \ manner.  More strictly, even\n      a suspicion that one of these has occurred\
    \ will be enough to be\n      considered as key compromise.\n   DNS:  The Domain\
    \ Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical global naming\n      catalog for computers,\
    \ services, or any resource connected to the\n      Internet.\n   DNS zone:  A\
    \ portion of the global Domain Name System (DNS) namespace\n      for which administrative\
    \ responsibility has been delegated.\n   DNSSEC:  DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)\
    \ is a set of IETF\n      specifications [RFC4033] [RFC4034] [RFC4035] that uses\
    \ public key\n      cryptography to add data origin authentication, data integrity\n\
    \      verification, and authenticated denial of existence capabilities\n    \
    \  to DNS.\n   DNSSEC Policy:  A DNSSEC Policy (DP) sets forth the security\n\
    \      requirements and standards to be implemented for a DNSSEC-signed\n    \
    \  zone.\n   DNSSEC Practice Statement:  A DNSSEC Practice Statement (DPS) is\
    \ a\n      practices disclosure document that may support and be a\n      supplemental\
    \ document to the DNSSEC Policy (if such exists), and\n      it states how the\
    \ management of a given zone implements procedures\n      and controls at a high\
    \ level.\n   Key rollover:  An operational process to change one of the DNSSEC\n\
    \      keys used for signing a zone via distribution of public keys in a\n   \
    \   trusted manner.\n   Multi-person control:  A security concept to distribute\
    \ the authority\n      of an operation over multiple persons, to mitigate threats\
    \ caused\n      by a single authorized individual.  For example, a key recovery\n\
    \      function may require some number of authorized individuals (m) out\n  \
    \    of the (n) to whom a portion of the recovery key was distributed,\n     \
    \ to combine their key fragments, before key recovery can occur.\n   PKI:  Public\
    \ Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a concept that makes use of\n      asymmetric cryptography\
    \ to provide a system with integrity,\n      authentication, and confidentiality\
    \ and to do it via distribution\n      of public keys in a trusted manner.\n \
    \  Policy authority:  The body responsible for setting and administering\n   \
    \   a DNSSEC Policy and for determining whether a DPS is suitable for\n      that\
    \ Policy.\n   Relying party:  An entity that relies on a signed response from\
    \ the\n      DNS.\n   Repository:  A location on the Internet to store DP, DPS,\
    \ trust\n      anchors, and other related information that should be kept public.\n\
    \   Security posture:  A security posture is an indicator of how secure\n    \
    \  an entity is and how secure the entity should be.  It is the\n      result\
    \ of an adequate threat model and risk assessment.\n   Separation of duties: \
    \ A security concept that limits the influence\n      of a single person by segregating\
    \ roles and responsibilities.\n   Signing key:  Private component of an asymmetric\
    \ key pair that is\n      used for signing of resource records within the zone.\
    \  Note that\n      the other component, called public key, is used for signature\n\
    \      validation.\n   TLD:  A Top-Level Domain (TLD) is one of the domains at\
    \ the highest\n      level below the root in the hierarchy of the DNS.\n   Trust\
    \ anchor:  Public portion of a key pair that is the authoritative\n      entity\
    \ used to authenticate the first element in a chain of trust.\n"
- title: 3.  Concepts
  contents:
  - "3.  Concepts\n   This section describes the concepts of a DNSSEC Policy and of\
    \ a\n   DNSSEC Practice Statement.  Other related concepts are described as\n\
    \   well.\n"
- title: 3.1.  DNSSEC Policy
  contents:
  - "3.1.  DNSSEC Policy\n   A DNSSEC Policy (DP) sets forth requirements that are\
    \ appropriate for\n   a specified level of assurance.  For example, a DP may encompass\
    \ all\n   topics of this framework, each with a certain set of security\n   requirements,\
    \ possibly grouped according to impact.  The progression\n   from medium to high\
    \ levels of assurance would correspond to\n   increasing security requirements\
    \ and corresponding increasing levels\n   of assurance.\n   A DP also constitutes\
    \ a basis for an audit, accreditation, or another\n   assessment of an entity.\
    \  Each entity can be assessed against one or\n   more DPs that it claims to implement.\n"
- title: 3.2.  DNSSEC Practice Statement
  contents:
  - "3.2.  DNSSEC Practice Statement\n   Most zone managers using DNSSEC will not\
    \ have the need to create a\n   thorough and detailed statement of practices.\
    \  For example, a\n   registrant may be the sole relying party of its own zone\
    \ and would\n   already be aware of the nature and trustworthiness of its services.\n\
    \   In other cases, a zone manager may provide registration services with\n  \
    \ only a very low level of assurances where the domain names being\n   secured\
    \ may pose only marginal risks if compromised.  Publishing a\n   DPS is most relevant\
    \ for entities operating a zone that contains a\n   significant number of delegations\
    \ to other entities.\n   A DNSSEC Practice Statement (DPS) should contain information\
    \ that is\n   relevant to the stakeholders of the relevant zone(s).  Since these\n\
    \   generally include the Internet community, it should not contain such\n   information\
    \ that could be considered to be sensitive details of an\n   entity's operations.\n\
    \   A DNSSEC Practice Statement may identify a supported DP, which may\n   subsequently\
    \ be used by a relying party to evaluate the\n   trustworthiness of any digital\
    \ signatures verified using the public\n   key of that entity.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Relationship between DNSSEC Policy and Practice Statement
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Relationship between DNSSEC Policy and Practice Statement\n   A DNSSEC\
    \ Policy and a DNSSEC Practice Statement address the same set\n   of topics of\
    \ interest to the stakeholders in terms of the level of\n   confidence ascribed\
    \ to the security posture of a zone.  The primary\n   difference is in the focus\
    \ of their provisions.  A Policy sets forth\n   the requirements and standards\
    \ to be implemented for a DNSSEC-signed\n   zone, and may be used to communicate\
    \ requirements that must be met by\n   complying parties; as such, it may also\
    \ be used to determine or\n   establish equivalency between policies associated\
    \ with different\n   zones.  A Practice Statement, by contrast, describes how\
    \ a zone\n   operator (and possibly other participants in the management of a\n\
    \   given zone) implements procedures and controls to meet the\n   requirements\
    \ of applicable Policies.  In other words, the Policy says\n   what needs to be\
    \ done, and the Practice Statement says what is being\n   done.\n   An additional\
    \ difference between a Policy and a Practice Statement\n   relates to the scope\
    \ of coverage of the two kinds of documents, in\n   terms of its applicability.\
    \  A Policy may apply to multiple\n   organizations or multiple zones.  By contrast,\
    \ a Practice Statement\n   would usually apply only to a single zone operator\
    \ or a single\n   organization, since it describes the actual controls in place\
    \ that\n   meet the requirements of applicable Policy.\n   For example, a TLD\
    \ manager or regulatory authority may define\n   requirements in a Policy for\
    \ the operation of one or more zones.  The\n   Policy will be a broad statement\
    \ of the general requirements for\n   managing the zone.  A zone operator may\
    \ be required to write its own\n   Practice Statement to support the Policy, explaining\
    \ how it meets the\n   requirements of the Policy.  Alternatively, a zone operator\
    \ that is\n   also the manager of that zone, and not governed by any external\n\
    \   Policy, may still choose to disclose operational practices by\n   publishing\
    \ a DPS.  The zone operator might do so to provide\n   transparency and to gain\
    \ community trust in its operations.\n   A Policy and a Practice Statement also\
    \ differ in the level of detail\n   each expresses: although there may be variations,\
    \ a Practice\n   Statement will provide a description of procedures and controls\
    \ and\n   so will usually be more detailed than a Policy, which provides\n   general\
    \ principles.\n   The main differences between a Policy and Practice Statement\
    \ can be\n   summarized as follows:\n   (a)  Operation of a DNS zone with DNSSEC\
    \ may be governed by a Policy\n        that establishes requirements stating what\
    \ the entity operating\n        that zone must do.  An entity can use a Practice\
    \ Statement to\n        disclose how it meets the requirements of a Policy or\
    \ how it has\n        implemented critical processes and controls, absent a\n\
    \        controlling Policy.\n   (b)  A Policy may serve the purpose of establishing\
    \ a common basis of\n        trusted operation throughout a set of zones in the\
    \ DNS\n        hierarchy.  By contrast, a Practice Statement is a statement of\n\
    \        a single zone operator or organization.\n   (c)  A Practice Statement\
    \ is generally more detailed than a Policy\n        and specifies how the zone\
    \ operator or organization implements\n        critical processes and controls,\
    \ and how the entity meets any\n        requirements specified in the one or more\
    \ Policies under which\n        it operates DNSSEC.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Set of Provisions
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Set of Provisions\n   A set of provisions is a collection of Policy requirements\
    \ or\n   Practice Statements, which may employ the approach described in this\n\
    \   framework by covering the topics appearing in Section 5 below.  The\n   topics\
    \ are described in detail in Section 4.\n   A Policy can be expressed as a single\
    \ set of provisions.  A Practice\n   Statement can also be expressed as a single\
    \ set of provisions with\n   each component addressing the requirements of one\
    \ or more Policies.\n   Alternatively, it could be a set of provisions that do\
    \ not reference\n   any particular policy but instead describe a set of self-imposed\n\
    \   controls to the stakeholders.  For example, a Practice Statement\n   could\
    \ be expressed as a combination of the following:\n   (a)  a list of Policies\
    \ supported by the DPS;\n   (b)  for each Policy in (a), a set of provisions that\
    \ contains\n        statements addressing the requirements by filling in details\
    \ not\n        stipulated in that policy or expressly left to the discretion of\n\
    \        the implementer.  Such statements serve to show how this\n        particular\
    \ Practice Statement implements the requirements of the\n        particular Policy;\
    \ or\n   (c)  a set of provisions that contains statements regarding the\n   \
    \     DNSSEC operations practices, independent of any Policy.\n   The statements\
    \ provided in (b) may augment or refine the stipulations\n   of an applicable\
    \ Policy, but generally they must not conflict with\n   the stipulations.  In\
    \ certain cases, however, a Policy authority may\n   permit exceptions because\
    \ certain compensating controls of the entity\n   disclosed in its Practice Statement\
    \ allow it to provide a level of\n   assurance equivalent to full compliance with\
    \ the policy.\n   The framework outlines the contents of a set of provisions,\
    \ in terms\n   of eight primary components, as follows:\n   1.  Introduction\n\
    \   2.  Publication and Repositories\n   3.  Operational Requirements\n   4. \
    \ Facility, Management, and Operational Controls\n   5.  Technical Security Controls\n\
    \   6.  Zone Signing\n   7.  Compliance Audit\n   8.  Legal Matters\n   This framework\
    \ can be used by Policy authorities to write DNSSEC\n   Policies and by zone operators\
    \ to write a DNSSEC Practice Statements.\n   Having a set of documents with the\
    \ same structure facilitates\n   comparisons with the corresponding documents\
    \ of other zones.\n"

    \   on any limitations of liability asserted by the registry manager.\n   In most\
    \ cases, the DPS is not a contract or part of a contract;\n   instead, it is laid\
    \ out so that its terms and conditions are applied\n   to the parties by separate\
    \ documents, such as registrar or registrant\n   agreements.  In other cases,\
    \ its contents may form part of a legal\n   contract between parties (either directly\
    \ or via other agreements).\n   In this case, legal expertise should be consulted\
    \ when drawing up\n   sections of the document that may have contractual implications.\n\
    \   At a minimum, the Legal Matters section should indicate under what\n   jurisdiction\
    \ the registry is operated and provide references to any\n   associated agreements\

    \ its own environment and the chain of trust originating from a trust\n   anchor,\
