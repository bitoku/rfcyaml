- title: 1. The W3C URI Interest Group
  contents:
  - "1. The W3C URI Interest Group\n   In October, 2000 the W3C formed a planning\
    \ group whose mission was to\n   evaluate the opportunities for W3C work in the\
    \ area of Uniform\n   Resource Identifiers (URIs) and to develop a proposal for\
    \ continued\n   work in this area.  The Interest Group was composed of W3C members\n\
    \   and invited experts from the IETF to participate as well.  This\n   document\
    \ is a set of recommendations from this group, to the W3C and\n   the IETF for\
    \ work that can and should continue in this area.\n"
- title: 2. URI Partitioning
  contents:
  - "2. URI Partitioning\n   There is some confusion in the web community over the\
    \ partitioning of\n   URI space, specifically, the relationship among the concepts\
    \ of URL,\n   URN, and URI.  The confusion owes to the incompatibility between\
    \ two\n   different views of URI partitioning, which we call the \"classical\"\
    \n   and \"contemporary\" views.\n"
- title: 2.1 Classical View
  contents:
  - "2.1 Classical View\n   During the early years of discussion of web identifiers\
    \ (early to mid\n   90s), people assumed that an identifier type would be cast\
    \ into one\n   of two (or possibly more) classes.  An identifier might specify\
    \ the\n   location of a resource (a URL) or its name (a URN), independent of\n\
    \   location.  Thus a URI was either a URL or a URN.  There was\n   discussion\
    \ about generalizing this by the addition of a discrete\n   number of additional\
    \ classes; for example, a URI might point to\n   metadata rather than the resource\
    \ itself, in which case the URI would\n   be a URC (citation).  URI space was\
    \ thus viewed as partitioned into\n   subspaces:  URL, URN, and additional subspaces\
    \ to be defined.  The\n   only such additional space ever proposed was Uniform\
    \ Resource\n   Characteristics (URC) and there never was any buy-in; so without\
    \ loss\n   of generality, it's reasonable to say that URI space was thought to\n\
    \   be partitioned into two classes: URL and URN.  Thus, for example,\n   \"http:\"\
    \ was a URL scheme, and \"isbn:\" would (someday) be a URN\n   scheme.  Any new\
    \ scheme would be cast into one of these two classes.\n"
- title: 2.2 Contemporary View
  contents:
  - "2.2 Contemporary View\n   Over time, the importance of this additional level\
    \ of hierarchy\n   seemed to lessen; the view became that an individual scheme\
    \ did not\n   need to be cast into one of a discrete set of URI types, such as\n\
    \   \"URL\", \"URN\", \"URC\", etc.  Web-identifier schemes are, in general,\n\
    \   URI schemes, as a given URI scheme may define subspaces.  Thus\n   \"http:\"\
    \ is a URI scheme.  \"urn:\" is also a URI scheme; it defines\n   subspaces, called\
    \ \"namespaces\".  For example, the set of URNs, of the\n   form \"urn:isbn:n-nn-nnnnnn-n\"\
    , is a URN namespace.  (\"isbn\" is an URN\n   namespace identifier.  It is not\
    \ a \"URN scheme\", nor is it a \"URI\n   scheme.\")\n   Further, according to\
    \ the contemporary view, the term \"URL\" does not\n   refer to a formal partition\
    \ of URI space; rather, URL is a useful but\n   informal concept.  A URL is a\
    \ type of URI that identifies a resource\n   via a representation of its primary\
    \ access mechanism (e.g., its\n   network \"location\"), rather than by some other\
    \ attributes it may\n   have.  Thus, as we noted, \"http:\" is a URI scheme. \
    \ An http URI is a\n   URL.  The phrase \"URL scheme\" is now used infrequently,\
    \ usually to\n   refer to some subclass of URI schemes which exclude URNs.\n"
- title: 2.3 Confusion
  contents:
  - "2.3 Confusion\n   The body of documents (RFCs, etc) covering URI architecture,\
    \ syntax,\n   registration, etc., spans both the classical and contemporary\n\
    \   periods.  People who are well-versed in URI matters tend to use \"URL\"\n\
    \   and \"URI\" in ways that seem to be interchangeable.  Among these\n   experts,\
    \ this isn't a problem, but among the Internet community at\n   large, it is a\
    \ problem.  People are not convinced that URI and URL\n   mean the same thing,\
    \ in documents where they (apparently) do.  When\n   one RFC talks about URI schemes\
    \ (e.g. \"URI Syntax\" (RFC 2396) [12]),\n   another talks about URL schemes (e.g.\
    \ \"Registration Procedures for\n   URL Schemes\" (RFC 2717) [1]), and yet another\
    \ talks of URN schemes\n   (\"Architectural Principles of URN Resolution\" (RFC\
    \ 2276) [13]), it is\n   natural to wonder how they difference, and how they relate\
    \ to one\n   another.  While RFC 2396, section 1.2, attempts to address the\n\
    \   distinction between URIs, URLs and URNs, it has not been successful\n   in\
    \ clearing up the confusion.\n"
- title: 3. Registration
  contents:
  - "3. Registration\n   This section examines the state of registration of URI schemes\
    \ and\n   URN namespaces and the mechanisms by which registration currently\n\

- title: 3.1.1 Registered URI schemes
  contents:
  - "3.1.1 Registered URI schemes\n   The official register of URI scheme names is\
    \ maintained by IANA, at\n   http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes.  For\
    \ each scheme, the\n   RFC that defines the scheme is listed; for example \"http:\"\
    \ is defined\n   by RFC2616 [14].  The table lists  34 schemes (at time of publication\n\
    \   of this RFC).  In addition, there are a few \"reserved\" scheme names;\n \
    \  at one point in time, these were intended to become registered\n   schemes\
    \ but have since been dropped.\n"
- title: 3.1.2 Unregistered URI Schemes
  contents:
  - "3.1.2 Unregistered URI Schemes\n   We distinguish between public (unregistered)\
    \ and private schemes.  A\n   public scheme (registered or not) is one for which\
    \ there is some\n   public document describing it.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.1 Public Unregistered Schemes
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.1 Public Unregistered Schemes\n   Dan Conolly's paper, at http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes,\n\
    \   provides a list of known public URI schemes, both registered and un-\n   registered,\
    \ a total of 85 schemes at time of publication of this RFC.\n   50 or so of these\
    \ are unregistered (not listed in the IANA register).\n   Some of these URI schemes\
    \ are obsolete (for example, \"phone\" is\n   obsolete, superceded by \"tel\"\
    ), while some have an RFC, but are not\n   included in the IANA list.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.2 Private Schemes
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.2 Private Schemes\n   It is probably impossible to determine all of these,\
    \ and it's not\n   clear that it's worthwhile to try, except perhaps to get some\
    \ idea of\n   their number.  In the minutes of the August 1997 IETF meeting is\
    \ the\n   observation that there may be 20-40 in use at Microsoft, with 2-3\n\
    \   being added a day, and that WebTV has 24, with 6 added per year.\n"

    \   guidelines.  RFC 2717 describes an organization of schemes into\n   \"trees\"\
    .  It is important to note that these two documents use the\n   historical term\
    \ 'URL' when in fact, they refer to URIs in general.\n   In fact, one of the recommended\
    \ tasks in Section 5 is for these\n   documents to be updated to use the term\
    \ 'URI' instead of 'URL'.\n"

    \ with the \"Contemporary View\"\n      described in section 1, and which considers\
    \ the additional URI\n      issues listed or alluded to in section 3.\n   2. RFCs\
    \ such as 2717 (\"Registration Procedures for URL Scheme Names\")\n      and 2718\
    \ (\"Guidelines for new URL Schemes\") should both be\n      generalized to refer\
    \ to \"URI schemes\", rather than \"URL schemes\"\n      and, after refinement,\
    \ moved forward as Best Current Practices in\n      the IETF.\n   3. The registration\
    \ procedures for alternative trees should be\n      clarified in RFC 2717.\n \
    \  4. Public, but unregistered schemes, should become registered, where\n    \
    \  possible.  Obsolete schemes should be purged or clearly marked as\n      obsolete.\n\
    \   5. IANA registration information should be updated:\n      *  Add 'urn' to\
    \ the list of registered URI schemes with a pointer\n         to the URN namespace\
    \ registry.\n      *  Maintain status information about pending registrations\
    \ (URI\n         schemes and URN NID requests ).\n      *  Insure that it is clear\
    \ that the page is the official registry,\n         e.g., by adding a heading\
    \ to the effect \"This is the Official\n         IANA Registry of URI Schemes\"\
