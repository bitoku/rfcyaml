  - "1.  Introduction\n   Most of the new IANA registries and respective IANA-allocation\n\
    \   processes for protocols defined in the PWE3 IETF working group can be\n  \
    \ found in this document.  The IANA registries defined here are in\n   general\
    \ subdivided into three main ranges: a range to be allocated by\n   IETF consensus\
    \ according to [RFC2434], a range to be allocated by the\n   expert review process\
    \ according to [RFC2434], and a range to be\n   allocated on a first come, first\
    \ served basis that is reserved for\n   vendor proprietary allocations.  Note\
    \ that vendor proprietary types\n   MUST NOT be registered for IETF standards\
    \ or extensions thereof,\n   whether they are still in development or already\
    \ completed.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Specification of Requirements\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"\
    REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has created several registries as described\
    \ in the following\n   paragraphs.  Each of these registries contains numeric\
    \ values used to\n   identify data types.  In each of these registries, the value\
    \ of 0 is\n   reserved and MUST not be used.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Expert Review Directives
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Expert Review Directives\n   Throughout this document, allocation procedures\
    \ for several\n   registries call for an expert review process according to [RFC2434].\n\
    \   The expert should consider the following points:\n      *  Duplication of\
    \ code point allocations should be avoided.\n      *  A brief, clear description\
    \ of the code point allocation\n         requested should be provided.\n     \
    \ *  The type allocation requested should be appropriate for the\n         particular\
    \ requested value range in the registry.\n   The expert reviewing the request\
    \ MUST approve or disapprove the\n   request within 10 business days from when\
    \ he or she received the\n   expert review request.\n"
- title: 3.2.  MPLS Pseudowire Type
  contents:
  - "3.2.  MPLS Pseudowire Type\n   IANA has set up the registry of \"MPLS Pseudowire\
    \ Type\".  This type\n   has 15-bit values.  PW Type values 1 through 30 are specified\
    \ in this\n   document, and PW Type values 31 through 1024 are to be assigned\
    \ by\n   IANA, using the \"Expert Review\" policy defined in [RFC2434].  PW Type\n\
    \   values 1025 through 4096 and 32767 are to be allocated using the IETF\n  \
    \ consensus policy defined in [RFC2434].  PW Type values 4097 through\n   32766\
    \ are reserved for vendor-proprietary extensions and are to be\n   assigned by\
    \ IANA, using the \"First Come First Served\" policy defined\n   in [RFC2434].\
    \  A Pseudowire Type description is required for any\n   assignment from this\
    \ registry.  Additionally, for the vendor-\n   proprietary extensions range, a\
