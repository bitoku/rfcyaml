  title: 2.  Requirements Notation
- contents:
  - "3.  Related Work and Usage Model\n   The NTP service is publicly offered on the
    Internet by a number of\n   organizations.  Those servers can be used but should
    not be abused,\n   so any method that is tasked to disseminate locations of NTP
    servers\n   must act responsibly in a manner that does not lead to public server\n
    \  overloading.  When using DHCPv6 to offer NTP server location, and if\n   there
    is a need to distribute a host with a hardcoded configuration,\n   this configuration
    MUST NOT include server location that is not part\n   of the organization that
    distributes this device.  Typical usage of\n   this option is to specify an NTP
    server that is part of the\n   organization that operates the DHCPv6 server.\n
    \  The location of the NTP service, like any other Internet service, can\n   be
    specified by an IP address or a Fully Qualified Domain Name\n   (FQDN).  By design,
    DHCP offers information to multiple devices and\n   is prone to amplification
    of mistakes, so great care must be taken to\n   define its configuration.  Specification
    of the NTP service by FQDN\n   offers a level of indirection that works as a possible
    mitigation\n   tool in case of misconfiguration.  DNS can be used to redirect\n
    \  misconfigured clients to an IPv6 address that is not configured on\n   any
    host instead of having to change the address of the NTP server\n   itself.\n   While
    the NTP specification defines a comprehensive set of\n   configuration parameters,
    modification of those parameters is best\n   left to the decision of the client
    itself.  The DHCPv6 option for NTP\n   is therefore restricted to server location.\n"
  title: 3.  Related Work and Usage Model

  - "4.  NTP Server Option for DHCPv6\n   This option serves as a container for server
    location information\n   related to one NTP server or Simple Network Time Protocol
    (SNTP)\n   [RFC4330] server.  This option can appear multiple times in a DHCPv6\n
    \  message.  Each instance of this option is to be considered by the NTP\n   client
    or SNTP client as a server to include in its configuration.\n   The option itself
    does not contain any value.  Instead, it contains\n   one or several suboptions
    that carry NTP server or SNTP server\n   location.  This option MUST include one,
    and only one, time source\n   suboption.  The currently defined time source suboptions
    are\n   NTP_OPTION_SRV_ADDR, NTP_OPTION_SRV_MC_ADDR, and NTP_OPTION_SRV_FQDN.\n
    \  It carries the NTP server or SNTP server location as a unicast or\n   multicast
    IPv6 address or as an NTP server or SNTP server FQDN.  More\n   time source suboptions
    may be defined in the future.  While the FQDN\n   option offers the most deployment
    flexibility, resiliency as well as\n   security, the IP address options are defined
    to cover cases where a\n   DNS dependency is not desirable.\n   If the NTP server
    or SNTP server location is an IPv6 multicast\n   address, the client SHOULD use
    this address as an NTP multicast group\n   address and listen to messages sent
    to this group in order to\n   synchronize its clock.\n   The format of the NTP
    Server Option is:\n      0                   1                   2                   3\n

- contents:
  - "5.  Appearance of This Option\n   The OPTION_NTP_SERVER option can appear multiple
    times in a DHCPv6\n   message.  The order in which these options appear is not
    significant.\n   The client uses its usual algorithms to determine which server(s)
    or\n   multicast group(s) should be preferred to synchronize its clock.\n   The
    OPTION_NTP_SERVER option MUST NOT appear in messages other than\n   the following:
    Solicit, Advertise, Request, Renew, Rebind,\n   Information-Request, and Reply.
    \ If this option appears in messages\n   other than those specified above, the
    receiver MUST ignore it.\n   The option number for this option MAY appear in the
    \"Option Request\"\n   option [RFC3315] in the following messages: Solicit, Request,
    Renew,\n   Rebind, Information-Request, and Reconfigure.  If this option number\n
    \  appears in the \"Option Request\" option in messages other than those\n   specified
    above, the receiver SHOULD ignore it.\n"
  title: 5.  Appearance of This Option
- contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This option could be used by an intruder to advertise
    the address of\n   a malicious NTP server or SNTP server and adversely affect
    the clock\n   of clients on the network.  The consequences of such an attack can
    be\n   critical, because many security protocols depend on time\n   synchronization
    to run their algorithms.  As an example, an attacker\n   could break connectivity
    between SEND-enabled nodes [RFC3971], simply\n   by affecting the clock on these
    nodes.\n   To prevent these attacks, it is strongly advisable to secure the use\n
    \  of this option by either:\n   -  using the NTPv4 Autokey public key authentication,
    as defined in\n      [RFC5906] or,\n   -  using authenticated DHCP as described
    in [RFC3315], Section 21.\n"

  - "7.  RFC 4075 Deprecation\n   \"Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Configuration
    Option for DHCPv6\"\n   [RFC4075] provides some degree of automatic time server
    configuration\n   for IPv6, as it specifies how to transmit SNTP [RFC4330] server\n
    \  addresses through DHCPv6.  However, this approach is not suitable for\n   all
    NTP deployments.  It is not an extensible mechanism and\n   introduces some semantic
    confusion through the use of the \"SNTP\"\n   acronym.  Additionally, the approach
    of only offering IPv6 addresses\n   to specify server location does not meet NTP
    requirements that make\n   use of an FQDN (Fully-Qualified Domain Name) as well.
    \ For all the\n   abovementioned reasons, this document makes [RFC4075] deprecated.\n"
