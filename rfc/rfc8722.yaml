  - "Abstract\n   Many Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocols make use of\n\
    \   commonly defined values that are passed in messages or packets.  To\n   ensure\
    \ consistent interpretation of these values between independent\n   implementations,\
    \ there is a need to ensure that the values and\n   associated semantic intent\

    \ the role\n   of Protocol Parameter Registry Operator to a nominated entity.\
    \  This\n   document provides a description of, and the requirements for, these\n\

- title: 1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.  Overview\n   Many IETF protocols make use of commonly defined values that\
    \ are\n   passed within messages or packets.  To ensure consistent\n   interpretation\
    \ of these values between independent implementations,\n   there is a need to\
    \ ensure that the values and associated semantic\n   intent are uniquely defined.\
    \  The IETF uses registries to record each\n   of the possible values of a protocol\
    \ parameter and their associated\n   semantic intent.  These registries, their\
    \ registration policy, and\n   the layout of their content are defined in the\
    \ so-called \"IANA\n   Considerations\" sections of IETF documents.\n   The organizational\
    \ separation between the IETF and its Protocol\n   Parameter Registry Operators\
    \ parallels ones that are fairly common\n   among standards development organizations\
    \ (SDOs) although less common\n   among technology consortia and similar bodies.\
    \  These functions have\n   been separated into different organizations for several\
    \ reasons.\n   They include dealing with administrative issues, addressing concerns\n\
    \   about maintaining an adequate distance between basic policy and\n   specific\
    \ allocations, and avoiding any potential conflicts of\n   interest that might\
    \ arise from commercial or organizational\n   relationships.  For example, most\
    \ ISO and ISO/IEC JTC1 standards that\n   require registration activities specify\
    \ a Registration Authority (RA)\n   or Maintenance Agency (MA) that, in turn,\
    \ control the actual\n   registration decisions.  The databases of what is registered\
    \ for each\n   standard may then be maintained by a secretariat or database function\n\
    \   associated with the RA or MA or, less frequently, by the secretariat\n   of\
    \ the body that created and maintains the standard itself.\n   This structural\
    \ separation of roles exists within several places in\n   the IETF framework (e.g.,\
    \ the RFC Editor function).  The Internet\n   Architecture Board (IAB), on behalf\
    \ of the IETF, has the\n   responsibility to define and manage the relationship\
    \ with the\n   Protocol Parameter Registry Operator role.  This responsibility\n\
    \   includes the selection and management of the Protocol Parameter\n   Registry\
    \ Operator, as well as management of the parameter\n   registration process and\
    \ the guidelines for parameter allocation.\n   As with other SDOs, although it\
    \ may delegate authority for some\n   specific decisions, the IETF asserts authority\
    \ and responsibility for\n   the management of all of its protocol parameters\
    \ and their\n   registries, even while it generally remains isolated from the\n\
    \   selection of particular values once a registration is approved.  This\n  \
    \ document describes the function of these registries as they apply to\n   individual\
    \ protocol parameters defined by the IETF Internet Standards\n   Process (see\
    \ RFC 6410 [BCP9]) to allow for an orderly implementation\n   by the IETF Administration\
    \ Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC), and\n   others as needed, under guidance\
    \ from the IAB.  This document\n   obsoletes RFC 6220 to replace all references\
    \ to the IASA and related\n   structures with those defined by the IASA 2.0 Model\
    \ [RFC8711].\n   Below we provide a description of the requirements for these\n\
    \   delegated functions, which the IETF traditionally refers to as the\n   Internet\
    \ Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) function.\n"
- title: 2.  Roles and Responsibilities Concerning IETF Protocol Parameter
  contents:
  - "2.  Roles and Responsibilities Concerning IETF Protocol Parameter\n    Registries\n\
    \   The IETF's longstanding practice is to outsource the management and\n   implementation\
    \ of some important functions (e.g., [RFC8728]).  The\n   protocol parameter registry\
    \ function falls into this category of\n   outsourced functions, and what follows\
    \ here is the description of the\n   roles and responsibilities with respect to\
    \ the registration of IETF\n   protocol parameters.\n   Specifically, this document\
    \ describes the operation and role of a\n   delegated IETF Protocol Parameter\
    \ Registry Operator, to be selected\n   and administered by the IETF Administrative\
    \ Support Activity (IASA)\n   [RFC8711].  While there is generally a single Protocol\
    \ Parameter\n   Registry Operator, additional Operators may be selected to implement\n\
    \   specific registries, and that has been done occasionally.  Having a\n   single\
    \ Protocol Parameter Registry Operator facilitates coordination\n   among registries,\
    \ even those that are not obviously related, and also\n   makes it easier to have\
    \ consistency of formats and registry\n   structure, which aids users of the registries\
    \ and assists with\n   quality control.\n   Many protocols make use of identifiers\
    \ consisting of constants and\n   other well-known values.  Even after a protocol\
    \ has been defined and\n   deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned\
    \ (e.g., for a\n   new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication\n\
    \   algorithm for IPsec).  To ensure that such quantities have consistent\n  \
    \ values and interpretations in different implementations, their\n   assignment\
    \ must be administered by a central authority.  For IETF\n   protocols, that role\
    \ is provided by a delegated Protocol Parameter\n   Registry Operator.  For any\
    \ particular protocol parameter there is a\n   single delegated Registry Operator.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Protocol Parameter Registry Operator Role
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Protocol Parameter Registry Operator Role\n   The IETF Protocol Parameter\
    \ Registry function is undertaken under the\n   auspices of the Internet Architecture\
    \ Board.\n   The roles of the Protocol Parameter Registry Operator (Registry\n\
    \   Operator) are as follows:\n   *  Review and Advise\n      -  A Registry Operator\
    \ may be requested to review Internet-Drafts\n         that are being considered\
    \ by the Internet Engineering Steering\n         Group (IESG), with the objective\
    \ of offering advice to the IESG\n         regarding the contents of the \"IANA\
    \ Considerations\" section,\n         whether such a section, when required, is\
    \ clear in terms of\n         direction to the Registry Operator, and whether\
    \ the section is\n         consistent with the current published Registry Operator\n\
    \         guidelines.\n   *  Registry\n      -  To operate a registry of protocol\
    \ parameter assignments.\n      -  The delegated Registry Operator registers values\
    \ for Internet\n         protocol parameters only as directed by the criteria\
    \ and\n         procedures specified in RFCs, including Standards Track\n    \
    \     documents [BCP9], Best Current Practice documents, and other\n         RFCs\
    \ that require protocol parameter assignment.\n         If values for Internet\
    \ protocol parameters were not specified,\n         or in case of ambiguity, the\
    \ Registry Operator will continue to\n         assign and register only those\
    \ protocol parameters that have\n         already been delegated to the Registry\
    \ Operator, following past\n         and current practice for such assignments,\
    \ unless otherwise\n         directed in terms of operating practice by the IESG.\
    \  In the\n         case of ambiguity, the Registry Operator is expected to\n\
    \         identify the ambiguity to the IAB or IESG as appropriate and\n     \
    \    either suggest better text or ask the appropriate parties for\n         clarification.\n\
    \      -  For each protocol parameter, the associated registry includes:\n   \
    \      o  a reference to the RFC document that describes the parameter\n     \
    \       and the associated \"IANA Considerations\" concerning the\n          \
    \  parameter, and\n         o  for each registration of a protocol parameter value,\
    \ the\n            source of the registration and the date of the registration,\n\
    \            if the date of registration is known, and\n         o  any other\
    \ information specified as being included in the\n            registration data\
    \ in the RFC document that describes the\n            parameter.\n         o \
    \ If in doubt or in case of a technical dispute, the Registry\n            Operator\
    \ will seek and follow technical guidance exclusively\n            from the IESG.\
    \  Where appropriate, the IESG will appoint an\n            expert to advise the\
    \ Registry Operator.\n      -  The Registry Operator will work with the IETF to\
    \ develop any\n         missing criteria and procedures over time, which the Registry\n\
    \         Operator will adopt when so instructed by the IESG.\n      -  Unless\
    \ special circumstances apply to subsets of the data and\n         specific rules\
    \ are established by IETF consensus, each protocol\n         parameter registry\
    \ operates as a public registry, and the\n         contents of the registry are\
    \ openly available to the public,\n         on-line and free of charge.\n    \
    \  -  The Registry Operator assigns protocol parameter values in\n         accordance\
    \ with the policy associated with the protocol\n         parameter, such as \"\
    First Come First Served\" or \"Expert Review\"\n         [RFC8126].\n   *  Mailing\
    \ Lists\n      -  The Registry Operator maintains public mailing lists as\n  \
    \       specified in IANA Considerations [RFC8126].  Such lists are\n        \
    \ designated for the purpose of review of assignment proposals in\n         conjunction\
    \ with a designated expert review function.  In\n         addition, each Registry\
    \ Operator should maintain a mailing list\n         that enables the registry\
    \ staff of the Registry Operator to be\n         contacted by email.\n   *  Liaison\
    \ Activity\n      -  The Registry Operator will nominate a liaison point of contact.\n\
    \         The Registry Operator, through this liaison, may be requested\n    \
    \     to provide advice to the IESG on IETF protocol parameters as\n         well\
    \ as the \"IANA Considerations\" section of each Internet-\n         Draft that\
    \ is being reviewed for publication as an RFC.  Where\n         appropriate the\
    \ IESG will appoint an expert to advise the\n         Registry Operator.\n   *\
    \  Reporting\n      -  The Registry Operator will submit periodic reports to the\
    \ IAB\n         concerning the operational performance of the registry\n     \
    \    function.  As an example of the requirements for such reports,\n        \
    \ the reader is referred to a supplement [MoU_SUPP2019] to the\n         \"Memorandum\

    \     elsewhere as directed, concerning the status of the registry\n         function.\n\
    \      -  The Registry Operator will publish an annual report describing\n   \
    \      the status of the function and a summary of performance\n         indicators.\n\
    \   *  Intellectual Property Rights and the Registry Operator\n      Unless special\
