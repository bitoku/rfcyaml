  - "1 Introduction: Overview of the Protocol\n   The TCP/IP protocol suite has been
    growing in importance as a multi-\n   vendor communications architecture. With
    the anticipated emergence of\n   OSI, we expect coexistence of TCP/IP and OSI
    to continue for an\n   extended period of time. There is a critical need for routers
    to\n   support both IP traffic and OSI traffic in parallel.\n   There are two
    main methods that are available for routing protocols\n   to support dual OSI
    and IP routers. One method, known as \"Ships in\n   the Night\", makes use of
    completely independent routing protocols for\n   each of the two protocol suites.
    This specification presents an\n   alternate approach, which makes use of a single
    integrated protocol\n   for interior routing (i.e., for calculating routes within
    a routing\n   domain) for both protocol suites.\n   This integrated protocol design
    is based on the OSI Intra-domain IS-\n   IS routing protocol [1], with IP-specific
    functions added. This RFC\n   is considered a companion to the OSI IS-IS Routing
    spec, and will\n   only describe the required additional features.\n   By supporting
    both IP and OSI traffic, this integrated protocol\n   design supports traffic
    to IP hosts, OSI end systems, and dual end\n   systems.  This approach is \"integrated\"
    in the sense that the IS-IS\n   protocol can be used to support pure-IP environments,
    pure-OSI\n   environments, and dual environments. In addition, this approach\n
    \  allows interconnection of dual (IP and OSI) routing domains with\n   other
    dual domains, with IP-only domains, and with OSI-only domains.\n   The protocol
    specified here is based on the work of the IETF IS-IS\n   working group.\n"

  - "1.1 What the Integrated IS-IS offers\n   The integrated IS-IS provides a single
    routing protocol which will\n   simultaneously provide an efficient routing protocol
    for TCP/IP, and\n   for OSI. This design makes use of the OSI IS-IS routing protocol,\n
    \  augmented with IP-specific information. This design provides explicit\n   support
    for IP subnetting, variable subnet masks, TOS-based routing,\n   and external
    routing. There is provision for authentication\n   information, including the
    use of passwords or other mechanisms. The\n   precise form of authentication mechanisms
    (other than passwords) is\n   outside of the scope of this document.\n   Both
    OSI and IP packets are forwarded \"as is\" -- i.e., they are\n   transmitted directly
    over the underlying link layer services without\n   the need for mutual encapsulation.
    The integrated IS-IS is a dynamic\n   routing protocol, based on the SPF (Dijkstra)
    routing algorithm.\n   The protocol described in this specification allows for
    mixing of\n   IP-only, OSI-only, and dual (IP and OSI) routers, as defined below.\n
    \  An IP-only IS-IS router (or \"IP-only\" router) is defined to be a\n   router
    which: (i) Uses IS-IS as the routing protocol for IP, as\n   specified in this
    report; and (ii) Does not otherwise support OSI\n   protocols. For example, such
    routers would not be able to forward OSI\n   CLNP packets.\n   An OSI-only router
    is defined to be a router which uses IS-IS as the\n   routing protocol for OSI,
    as specified in [1]. Generally, OSI-only\n   routers may be expected to conform
    to OSI standards, and may be\n   implemented independent of this specification.\n
    \  A dual IS-IS router (or \"dual\" router) is defined to be a router\n   which
    uses IS-IS as a single integrated routing protocol for both IP\n   and OSI, as
    specified in this report.\n   This approach does not change the way that IP packets
    are handled.\n   IP-only and dual routers are required to conform to the requirements\n
    \  of Internet Gateways [4]. The integrated IS-IS protocol described in\n   this
    report outlines an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) which will\n   provide routing
    within a TCP/IP routing domain (i.e., autonomous\n   system). Other aspects of
    router functionality (e.g., operation of\n   ICMP, ARP, EGP, etc.) are not affected
    by this proposal.\n   Similarly, this approach does not change the way that OSI
    packets are\n   handled. There will be no change at all to the contents nor to
    the\n   handling of ISO 8473 Data packets and Error Reports, nor to ISO 9542\n
    \  Redirects and ES Hellos. ISO 9542 IS Hellos transmitted on LANs are\n   similarly
    unchanged. ISO 9542 IS Hellos transmitted on point-to-point\n   links are unchanged
    except for the addition of IP-related\n   information.  Similarly, other OSI packets
    (specifically those\n   involved in the IS-IS intra-domain routing protocol) remain
    unchanged\n   except for the addition of IP-related information.\n   This approach
    makes use of the existing IS-IS packets, with IP-\n   specific fields added. Specifically:
    (i) authentication information\n   may be added to all IS-IS packets; (ii) the
    protocols supported by\n   each router, as well as each router's IP addresses,
    are specified in\n   ISO 9542 IS Hello, IS-IS Hello and Link State Packets; (iii)\n
    \  internally reachable IP addresses are specified in all Link State\n   Packets;
    and (iv) externally reachable IP addresses, and external\n   routing protocol
    information, may be specified in level 2 Link State\n   Packets. The detailed
    encoding and interpretation of this in\n   formation is specified in sections
    3, 4, and 5 of this RFC.\n   The protocol described in this report may be used
    to provide routing\n   in an IP-only routing domain, in which all routers are
    IP-only.\n   Similarly, this protocol may be used to provide routing in a pure\n
    \  dual domain, in which all routers are dual. Finally, this protocol\n   may
    be used to provide routing in a mixed domain, in which some\n   routers are IP-only,
    some routers are OSI-only, and some routers are\n   dual. The specific topological
    restrictions which apply in this\n   latter case are described in detail in section
    1.4 (\"Support of Mixed\n   Routing Domains\").  The use of IS-IS for support
    of pure OSI domains\n   is specified in [1].\n   This protocol specification does
    not constrain which network\n   management protocol(s) may be used to manage IS-IS-based
    routers.\n   Management information bases (MIBs) for managing IP-only, OSI-only,\n
    \  and dual routers, compatible with CMIP, CMOT, and/or SNMP, are the\n   subject
    of a separate, companion document [8].\n"
  title: 1.1 What the Integrated IS-IS offers
- contents:
  - "1.2 Overview of the ISO IS-IS Protocol\n   The IS-IS Routing Protocol has been
    developed in ISO to provide\n   routing for pure OSI environments. In particular,
    IS-IS is designed\n   to work in conjunction with ISO 8473 (The ISO Connectionless
    Network\n   Layer Protocol [2]), and ISO 9542 (The ISO End System to Intermediate\n
    \  System Protocol [3]). This section briefly describes the manner in\n   which
    IS-IS is used to support pure OSI environments. Enhancements\n   for support of
    IP and dual environments are specified elsewhere in\n   this report.\n   In IS-IS,
    the network is partitioned into \"routing domains\". The\n   boundaries of routing
    domains are defined by network management, by\n   setting some links to be \"exterior
    links\". If a link is marked as\n   \"exterior\", no IS-IS routing messages are
    sent on that link.\n   Currently, ISO does not have a standard for inter-domain
    routing\n   (i.e., for routing between separate autonomous routing domains).\n
    \  Instead, manual configuration is used. The link is statically\n   configured
    with the set of address prefixes reachable via that link,\n   and with the method
    by which they can be reached (such as the DTE\n   address to be dialed to reach
    that address, or the fact that the DTE\n   address should be extracted from the
    IDP portion of the ISO address).\n   OSI IS-IS routing makes use of two-level
    hierarchical routing. A\n   routing domain is partitioned into areas. Level 1
    routers know the\n   topology in their area, including all routers and end systems
    in\n   their area. However, level 1 routers do not know the identity of\n   routers
    or destinations outside of their area. Level 1 routers\n   forward all traffic
    for destinations outside of their area to a level\n   2 router in their area.
    Similarly, level 2 routers know the level 2\n   topology, and know which addresses
    are reachable via each level 2\n   router. However, level 2 routers do not need
    to know the topology\n   within any level 1 area, except to the extent that a
    level 2 router\n   may also be a level 1 router within a single area. Only level
    2\n   routers can exchange data packets or routing information directly\n   with
    external routers located outside of the routing domains.\n    +----------------------+-------------------------------+\n

    \        Figure 1 - ISO Hierarchical Address Structure\n   As illustrated in figure
    1, ISO addresses are subdivided into the\n   Initial Domain Part (IDP), and the
    Domain Specific Part (DSP). The\n   IDP is the part which is standardized by ISO,
    and specifies the\n   format and authority responsible for assigning the rest
    of the\n   address. The DSP is assigned by whatever addressing authority is\n
    \  specified by the IDP. The DSP is further subdivided into a \"High\n   Order
    Part of DSP\" (HO-DSP), a system identifier (ID), and an NSAP\n   selector (SEL).
    The HO-DSP may use any format desired by the\n   authority which is identified
    by the IDP. Together, the combination\n   of [IDP, HO-DSP] identify both the routing
    domain and the area within\n   the routing domain. The combination of [IDP,HO-DSP]
    may therefore be\n   referred to as the \"Area Address\".\n   Usually, all nodes
    in an area have the same area address. However,\n   sometimes an area might have
    multiple addresses. Motivations for\n   allowing this are:\n   - It might be desirable
    to change the address of an area. The most\n     graceful way of changing an area
    from having address A to having\n     address B is to first allow it to have both
    addresses A and B, and\n     then after all nodes in the area have been modified
    to recognize\n     both addresses, then one by one the nodes can be modified to\n
    \    \"forget\" address A.\n   - It might be desirable to merge areas A and B
    into one area. The\n     method for accomplishing this is to, one by one, add
    knowledge of\n     address B into the A partition, and similarly add knowledge
    of\n     address A into the B  partition.\n   - It might be desirable to partition
    an area C into two areas, A\n     and B (where \"A\" might equal \"C\", in which
    case this example\n     becomes one of removing a portion of an area). This would
    be\n     accomplished by first introducing knowledge of address A into\n     the
    appropriate nodes (those destined to become area A), and\n     knowledge of address
    B into the appropriate nodes, and then one\n     by one removing knowledge of
    address C.\n   Since OSI addressing explicitly identifies the area, it is very
    easy\n   for level 1 routers to identify packets going to destinations outside\n
    \  of their area, which need to be forwarded to level 2 routers.\n   In IS-IS,
    there are two types of routers:\n   - Level 1 intermediate systems -- these nodes
    route based on the ID\n     portion of the ISO address. They route within an area.
    They\n     recognize, based on the destination address in a packet, whether\n
    \    the destination is within the area. If so, they route towards\n     the destination.
    If not, they route to the nearest level 2 router.\n   - Level 2 intermediate systems
    -- these nodes route based on the area\n     address (i.e., on the combination
    of [IDP, HO-DSP]). They route\n     towards areas, without regard to the internal
    structure of an area.\n     A level 2 IS may also be a level 1 IS in one area.\n
    \  A level 1 router will have the area portion of its address manually\n   configured.
    It will refuse to become a neighbor with a node whose\n   area addresses do not
    overlap its area addresses. However, if level 1\n   router has area addresses
    A,  B, and C, and a neighbor has area\n   addresses B and D, then the level 1
    router will accept the other node\n   as a neighbor.\n   A level 2 router will
    accept another level 2 router as a neighbor,\n   regardless of area address. However,
    if the area addresses do not\n   overlap, the link would be considered by both
    routers to be \"level 2\n   only\", and only level 2 LSPs would flow on the link.
    External links\n   (to other routing domains) must be from level 2 routers.\n
    \  IS-IS provides an optional partition repair function. In the unlikely\n   case
    that a level 1 area become partitioned, this function, if\n   implemented, allows
    the partition to be repaired via use of level 2\n   routes.\n   IS-IS requires
    that the set of level 2 routers be connected. Should\n   the level 2 backbone
    become partitioned, there is no provision for\n   use of level 1 links to repair
    a level 2 partition.\n   In unusual cases, a single level 2 router may lose connectivity
    to\n   the level 2 backbone. In this case the level 2 router will indicate\n   in
    its level 1 LSPs that it is not \"attached\", thereby allowing level\n   1 routers
    in the area to route traffic for outside of the domain to a\n   different level
    2 router. Level 1 routers therefore route traffic to\n   destinations outside
    of their area only to level 2 routers which\n   indicate in their level 1 LSPs
    that they are \"attached\".\n   An end system may autoconfigure the area portion
    of its address by\n   extracting the area portion of a neighboring router's address.
    If\n   this is the case, then an endnode will always accept a router as a\n   neighbor.
    Since the standard does not specify that the end system\n   MUST autoconfigure
    its area address, an end system may be configured\n   with an area address. In
    this case the end system would ignore router\n   neighbors with non-matching area
    addresses.\n   Special treatment is necessary for broadcast subnetworks, such
    as\n   LANs. This solves two sets of issues: (i) In the absence of special\n   treatment,
    each router on the subnetwork would announce a link to\n   every other router
    on the subnetwork, resulting in n-squared links\n   reported; (ii) Again, in the
    absence of special treatment, each\n   router on the LAN would report the same
    identical list of end systems\n   on the LAN, resulting in substantial duplication.\n
    \  These problems are avoided by use of a \"pseudonode\", which represents\n   the
    LAN. Each router on the LAN reports that it has a link to the\n   pseudonode (rather
    than reporting a link to every other router on the\n   LAN). One of the routers
    on the LAN is elected \"designated router\".\n   The designated router then sends
    out an LSP on behalf of the\n   pseudonode, reporting links to all of the routers
    on the LAN. This\n   reduces the potential n-squared links to n links. In addition,
    only\n   the pseudonode LSP includes the list of end systems on the LAN,\n   thereby
    eliminating the potential duplication (for further\n   information on designated
    routers and pseudonodes, see [1]).\n   The IS-IS provides for optional Quality
    of Service (QOS) routing,\n   based on throughput (the default metric), delay,
    expense, or residual\n   error probability. This is described in greater detail
    in section\n   3.5, and in [1].\n"
  title: 1.2 Overview of the ISO IS-IS Protocol
- contents:
  - "1.3 Overview of the Integrated IS-IS\n   The integrated IS-IS allows a single
    routing protocol to be used to\n   route both IP and OSI packets. This implies
    that the same two-level\n   hierarchy will be used for both IP and OSI routing.
    Each area will be\n   specified to be either IP-only (only IP traffic can be routed
    in that\n   particular area), OSI-only (only OSI traffic can be routed in that\n
    \  area), or dual (both IP and OSI traffic can be routed in the area).\n   This
    proposal does not allow for partial overlap of OSI and IP areas.\n   For example,
    if one area is OSI-only, and an other area is IP-only,\n   then it is not permissible
    to have some routers be in both areas.\n   Similarly, a single backbone is used
    for the routing domain. There is\n   no provision for independent OSI and IP backbones.\n
    \  Similarly, within an IP-only or dual area, the amount of knowledge\n   maintained
    by routers about specific IP destinations will be as\n   similar as possible as
    for OSI. For example, IP-capable level 1\n   routers will maintain the topology
    within the area, and will be able\n   to route directly to IP destinations within
    the area. However, IP-\n   capable level 1 routers will not maintain information
    about\n   destinations outside of the area. Just as in normal OSI routing,\n   traffic
    to destinations outside of the area will be forwarded to the\n   nearest level
    2 router. Since IP routes to subnets, rather than to\n   specific end systems,
    IP routers will not need to keep nor distribute\n   lists of IP host identifiers
    (note that routes to hosts can be\n   announced by using a subnet mask of all
    ones).\n   The IP address structure allows networks to be partitioned into\n   subnets,
    and allows subnets to be recursively subdivided into smaller\n   subnets. However,
    it is undesireable to require any specific\n   relationship between IP subnet
    addresses and IS-IS areas. For\n   example, in many cases, the dual routers may
    be installed into\n   existing environments, which already have assigned IP and/or
    OSI\n   addresses. In addition, even if IP addresses are not already pre-\n   assigned,
    the address limitations of IP constrain what addresses may\n   be assigned. We
    therefore will not require any specific relationship\n   between IP addresses
    and the area structure. The IP addresses can be\n   assigned completely independently
    of the OSI addresses and IS-IS area\n   structure. As will be described in section
    3.2 (\"Hierarchical\n   Abbreviation of IP Reachability Information\"), greater
    efficiency and\n   scaling of the routing algorithm can be achieved if there is
    some\n   correspondence between the IP address assignment structure and the\n
    \  area structure.\n   Within an area, level 1 routers exchange link state packets
    which\n   identify the IP addresses reachable by each router. Specifically,\n
    \  zero or more [IP address, subnet mask, metric] combinations may be\n   included
    in each Link State Packet. Each level 1 router is manually\n   configured with
    the [IP address, subnet mask, metric] combinations\n   which are reachable on
    each interface. A level 1 router routes as\n   follows:\n   - If a specified destination
    address matches an [IP address, subnet\n     mask, metric] reachable within the
    area, the packet is routed via\n     level 1 routing.\n   - If a specified destination
    address does not match any [IP address,\n     subnet mask, metric] combination
    listed as reachable within the\n     area, the packet is routed towards the nearest
    level 2 router.\n   Flexible use of the limited IP address space is important
    in order to\n   cope with the anticipated growth of IP environments. Thus an area\n
    \  (and by implication a routing domain) may simultaneously make use of\n   a
    variety of different address masks for different subnets in the\n   area (or domain).
    Generally, if a specified destination address\n   matches more than one [IP address,
    subnet mask] pair, the more\n   specific address is the one routed towards (the
    one with more \"1\"\n   bits in the mask -- this is known as \"best match\" routing).\n
    \  Level 2 routers include in their level 2 LSPs a complete list of [IP\n   address,
    subnet mask, metric] specifying all IP addresses reachable\n   in their area.
    As described in section 3, this information may be\n   obtained from a combination
    of the level 1 LSPs (obtained from level\n   1 routers in the same area), and/or
    by manual configuration. In\n   addition, Level 2 routers may report external
    reachability\n   information, corresponding to addresses which can be reached
    via\n   routers in other routing domains (autonomous systems)\n   Default routes
    may be announced by use of a subnet mask containing\n   all zeroes. Default routes
    should be used with great care, since they\n   can result in \"black holes\".
    Default routes are permitted only at\n   level 2 as external routes (i.e., included
    in the \"IP External\n   Reachability Information\" field, as explained in sections
    3 and 5).\n   Default routes are not permitted at level 1.\n   The integrated
    IS-IS provides optional Type of Service (TOS) routing,\n   through use of the
    QOS feature from IS-IS.\n"

  - "1.5 Advantages of Using Integrated IS-IS\n   Use of the integrated IS-IS protocol,
    as a single protocol for\n   routing both IP and OSI packets in a dual environment,
    has\n   significant advantages over using separate protocols for\n   independently
    routing IP and OSI traffic.\n   An alternative approach is known as \"Ships In
    the Night\" (S.I.N.).\n   With the S.I.N. approach, completely separate routing
    protocols are\n   used for IP and for OSI. For example, OSPF [5] may be used for\n
    \  routing IP traffic, and IS-IS [1] may be used for routing OSI\n   traffic.
    With S.I.N., the two routing protocols operate more or less\n   independently.
    However, dual routers will need to implement both\n   routing protocols, and therefore
    there will be some degree of\n   competition for resources.\n   Note that S.I.N.
    and the integrated IS-IS approach are not really\n   completely separate options.
    In particular, if the integrated IS-IS\n   is used within a routing domain for
    routing of IP and OSI traffic, it\n   is still possible to use other independent
    routing protocols for\n   routing other protocol suites.\n   In the future, optional
    extensions to IS-IS may be defined for\n   routing other common protocol suites.
    However, such future options\n   are outside of the scope of this document. This
    section will compare\n   integrated IS-IS and S.I.N. for routing of IP and OSI
    only.\n   A primary advantage of the integrated IS-IS relates to the network\n
    \  management effort required. Since the integrated IS-IS provides a\n   single
    routing protocol, within a single coordinated routing domain\n   using a single
    backbone, this implies that there is less information\n   to configure. This combined
    with a single coordinated MIB simplifies\n   network management.\n   Note that
    the operation of two routing protocols with the S.I.N.\n   approach are not really
    independent, since they must share common\n   resources. However, with the integrated
    IS-IS, the interactions are\n   explicit, whereas with S.I.N., the interactions
    are implicit. Since\n   the interactions are explicit, again it may be easier
    to manage and\n   debug dual routers.\n   Another advantage of the integrated
    IS-IS is that, since it requires\n   only one routing protocol, it uses fewer
    resources. In particular,\n   less implementation resources are needed (since
    only one protocol\n   needs to be implemented), less CPU and memory resources
    are used in\n   the router (since only one protocol needs to be run), and less\n
    \  network resources are used (since only one set of routing packets\n   need
    to be transmitted). Primarily this translates into a financial\n   savings, since
    each of these three types of resources cost money.\n   This implies that dual
    routers based on the integrated IS-IS should\n   be less expensive to purchase
    and operate than dual routers based on\n   S.I.N.\n   Note that the operation
    of two routing protocols with the S.I.N.\n   approach are not really independent,
    since they must share common\n   resources. For example, if one routing protocol
    becomes unstable and\n   starts to use excessive resources, the other protocol
    is likely to\n   suffer. A bug in one protocol could crash the other. However,
    with\n   the integrated IS-IS, the interactions are explicit and are defined\n
    \  into the protocol and software interactions. With S.I.N., the\n   interactions
    are implicit.\n   The use of a single integrated routing protocol similarly reduces
    the\n   likely frequency of software upgrades. Specifically, if you have two\n
    \  different routing protocols in your router, then you have to upgrade\n   the
    software any time EITHER of the protocols change. If you make use\n   of a single
    integrated routing protocol, then software changes are\n   still likely to be
    needed, but less frequently.\n   Finally, routing protocols have significant real
    time requirements.\n   In IS-IS, these real time requirements have been explicitly\n
    \  specified. In other routing protocols, these requirements are\n   implicit.
    However, in all routing protocols, there are real time\n   guarantees which must
    be met in order to ensure correct operation. In\n   general, it is difficult enough
    to ensure compliance with real time\n   requirements in the implementation of
    a single real time system. With\n   S.I.N., implementation of two semi-independent
    real-time protocols in\n   a single device makes this more difficult.\n   Note
    that both integrated IS-IS and S.I.N. allow for independence of\n   external routes
    (for traffic from/to outside of the routing domain),\n   and allow for independent
    assignment of OSI and TCP/IP addresses.\n"

  - "3.1 Exchange of Routing Information\n   The exchange of routing information between
    routers makes use of the\n   normal routing packet exchange as defined in the
    OSI IS-IS routing\n   spec, with additional IP-specific information added to the
    IS-IS\n   routing packets.\n   The IS-IS protocol provides for the inclusion of
    variable length\n   fields in all IS-IS packets. These fields are encoded using
    a \"Code,\n   Length, Value\" triplet, where the code and length are encoded in
    one\n   octet each, and the value has the length specified (from 0 to 254\n   octets).
    IS-IS requires that: \"Any codes in a received PDU that are\n   not recognised
    are ignored and passed through unchanged\". This\n   requirement applies to all
    routers implementing IS-IS, including\n   OSI-only, IP-only, and dual routers.
    This allows IP-specific\n   information to be encoded in a manner which OSI-only
    routers will\n   ignore, and also allows OSI-specific information to be encoded
    in a\n   manner which IP-only routers will ignore.\n   IP-capable (i.e., all IP-only
    and dual) routers need to know what\n   network layer protocols are supported
    by other routers in their area.\n   This information is made available by inclusion
    of a \"protocols\n   supported\" field in all IS-IS Hello and Link State Packets.
    This\n   field makes use of the NLPID (Network Layer Protocol Identifier),\n   which
    is a one-octet value assigned by ISO to identify network level\n   protocols.
    NLPID values have been assigned to ISO 8473 and to IP.\n   IP-capable routers
    need to know the IP address of the adjacent\n   interface of neighboring routers.
    This is required for sending ICMP\n   redirects (when an IP-capable router sends
    an ICMP redirect to a\n   host, it must include the IP address of the appropriate
    interface of\n   the correct next-hop router). This information is made available
    by\n   inclusion of the IP interface address in the IS-IS Hello packets.\n   Specifically,
    each IS-IS Hello packet contains the IP address(es) of\n   the interface over
    which the Hello is transmitted. The IS-IS allows\n   multiple IP addresses to
    be assigned to each physical interface.\n   In some cases, it will be useful for
    IP-capable routers to be able to\n   determine an IP address(es) of all other
    routers at their level\n   (i.e., for level 1 routers: all other routers in their
    area; for\n   level 2 routers: all other level 2 routers in the routing domain).\n
    \  This is useful whenever an IP packet is to be sent to a router, such\n   as
    for encapsulation or for transmission of network management\n   packets. This
    information is made available by inclusion of IP\n   address in LSPs. Specifically,
    each IS-IS LSP includes one or more IP\n   addresses of the router which transmits
    the LSP. An IP-capable router\n   is required to include at least one of its IP
    addresses in its LSPs,\n   and may optionally include several or all of its IP
    addresses. Where\n   a single router operates as both a level 1 and a level 2
    router, it\n   is required to include the same IP address(es) in its level 1 and\n
    \  level 2 LSPs.\n   IP-capable routers need to know, for any given IP destination\n
    \  address, the correct route to that destination. Specifically, level 1\n   routers
    need to know what IP addresses are reachable from each level\n   1 router in their
    area. In addition, level 1 routers need to find\n   level 2 routers (for traffic
    to IP addresses outside of their area).\n   Level 2 routers need to know what
    IP addresses are reachable\n   internally (either directly, or via level 1 routing)
    from other level\n   2 routers, and what addresses are reachable externally from
    other\n   level 2 routers. All of this information is made available by\n   inclusion
    of IP reachable address information in the Link State\n   Packets.\n   Internal
    (within the routing domain) and external (outside the\n   domain) reachability
    information is announced separately in level 2\n   LSPs. Reachable IP addresses
    include a default metric, and may\n   include multiple TOS-specific metrics. In
    general, for external\n   routes, metrics may be of type \"internal\" (i.e., directly
    comparable\n   with internal metrics) or of type \"external\" (i.e., not comparable\n
    \  with the internal metric). A route using internal metrics (i.e.,\n   either
    announced as \"IP internal reachability information\", or\n   announced as \"IP
    external reachability information\" with an internal\n   metric) is always preferred
    to a route using external metrics (i.e.,\n   announced as \"IP external reachability
    information\", with an external\n   metric).\n   The detailed encoding of the
    IP-specific information included in\n   routing packets is provided in section
    5 (Structure and Encoding of\n   PDUs).\n"

  - "3.2 Hierarchical Abbreviation of IP Reachability Information\n   Level 2 routers
    include in their level 2 LSPs a list of all [IP\n   address, subnet mask, metric]
    combinations reachable in their area.\n   In general, this information may be
    determined from the level 1 LSPs\n   from all routers in the area. If we ignore
    resource constraints, then\n   it would be permissible for a level 2 router to
    simply duplicate all\n   [IP address, subnet mask, metric] entries from all level
    1 routers in\n   its area (with appropriate metric adjustment), for inclusion
    in its\n   level 2 LSP. However, in order for hierarchical routing to scale to\n
    \  large routing domain sizes, it is highly desired to abbreviate the\n   reachable
    address information.\n   This is accomplished by manual configuration of summary
    addresses.\n   Each level 2 router may be configured with one or more [IP address,\n
    \  subnet mask, metric] entries for announcement in their level 2 LSPs.\n   The
    set of reachable addresses obtained from level 1 LSPs is compared\n   with the
    configured reachable addresses. Redundant information\n   obtained from level
    1 LSPs is not included in level 2 LSPs. Generally\n   it is expected that the
    level 2 configured information will specify\n   more inclusive addresses (corresponding
    to a subnet mask with fewer\n   bits set to 1). This will therefore allow one
    configured\n   address/submask pair (or a small number of such pairs) to\n   hierarchically
    supercede the information corresponding to multiple\n   entries in level 1 LSPs.\n
    \  The manually configured addresses are included in level 2 LSPs only\n   if
    they correspond to at least one address which is reachable in the\n   area. For
    manually configured level 2 addresses, the associated\n   metric values to announce
    in level 2 LSPs are also manually\n   configured. The configured addresses will
    supercede reachable address\n   entries from level 1 LSPs based only on the IP
    address and subnet\n   mask -- metric values are not considered when determining
    if a given\n   configured address supercedes an address obtained from a level
    1 LSP.\n   Any address obtained from a level 1 LSP which is not superceded by\n
    \  the manually configured information is included in the level 2 LSPs.\n   In
    this case, the metric value announced in the level 2 LSPs is\n   calculated from
    the sum of the metric value announced in the\n   corresponding level 1 LSP, plus
    the distance from the level 2 router\n   to the appropriate level 1 router. Note:
    If this sum results in a\n   metric value greater than 63 (the maximum value that
    can be reported\n   in level 2 LSPs), then the value 63 must be used. Delay, expense,
    and\n   error metrics (i.e., those TOS metrics other than the default metric)\n
    \  will be included only if (i) the level 2 router supports the specific\n   TOS;
    (ii) the path from the level 2 router to the appropropriate\n   level 1 router
    is made up of links which support the specific TOS;\n   and (iii) the level 1
    router which can reach the address directly\n   also supports the specific TOS
    for this route, as indicated in its\n   level 1 LSP.\n   In general, the same
    [IP address, subnet mask] pair may be announced\n   in level 1 LSPs sent by multiple
    level 1 routers in the same area. In\n   this case (assuming the entry is not
    superceded by a manually\n   configured entry), then only one such entry shall
    be included in the\n   level 2 LSP. The metric value(s) announced in level 2 LSPs
    correspond\n   to the minimum of the metric value(s) that would be calculated
    for\n   each of the level 1 LSP entries.\n   A level 2 router will have IP addresses
    which are directly reachable\n   via its own interfaces. For purposes of inclusion
    of IP reachable\n   address information in level 2 LSPs, these \"directly reachable\"\n
    \  addresses are treated exactly the same as addresses received in level\n   1
    LSPs.\n   Manually configured addresses may hierarchically supercede multiple\n
    \  level 1 reachable address entries. However, there may be some IP\n   addresses
    which match the manually configured addresses, but which\n   are not reachable
    via level 1 routing. If a level 2 router receives\n   an IP packet whose IP address
    matches a manually configured address\n   which it is including in its level 2
    LSP, but which is not reachable\n   via level 1 routing in the area, then the
    packet must be discarded.\n   In this case, an error report may be returned (as
    specified in RFC\n   1009), with the reason for discard specifying destination\n
    \  unreachable.\n           Figure 2 - An Example Routing Domain (not shown)\n
    \  An example is illustrated in figure 2. Suppose that the network\n   number
    for the entire routing domain is 17 (a class A network).\n   Suppose each area
    is assigned a subnet number consisting of the next\n   8 bits. The area may be
    further subdivided by assigning the next\n   eight bits to each LAN in the area,
    giving each a 24 bit subnet mask\n   (counting the network and subnet fields).
    Finally 8 bits are left for\n   the host field. Suppose that for a particular
    area (given subnet\n   number 17.133) there are a number of IP capable level 1
    routers\n   announcing (in the special IP entry in their level 1 LSPs) subnets\n
    \  17.133.5, 17.133.43, and 17.133.57.\n   Suppose that in this example, in order
    to save space in level 2 LSPs,\n   the level 2 routers in this area are configured
    to announce subnet\n   17.133. Only this one address needs to be announced in
    level 2 LSPs.\n   Thus if an IP packet comes along for an address in subnet 17.133.5,\n
    \  17.133.43 or 17.133.57, then other level 2 routers, in other areas,\n   will
    know to pass the traffic to this area.\n   The inclusion of 17.133 in level 2
    LSPs means that the three subnet\n   addresses starting with 17.133 do not all
    have to be listed\n   separately in level 2 LSPs.\n   If any traffic comes along
    that is for an unreachable address such as\n   17.133.124.7, then level 2 routers
    in other areas in this particular\n   domain will think that this area can handle
    this traffic, will\n   forward traffic to level 2 routers in this area, which
    will have to\n   discard this traffic.\n   Suppose that subnet number 17.133.125
    was actually reachable via some\n   other area, such as the lower right hand area.
    In this case, the\n   level 2 router in the left area would be announcing (in
    its level 2\n   LSPs according to manually configured information) reachability
    to\n   subnet 17.133. However, the level 2 router in the lower right area\n   would
    be announcing (in its level 2 LSPs according to information\n   taken from its
    received level 1 LSPs), reachability to subnet\n   17.133.125. Due to the use
    of best match routing, this works\n   correctly. All traffic from other areas
    destined to subnet 17.133.125\n   would be sent to the level 2 router in the lower
    right area, and all\n   other traffic to subnet 17.133 (i.e., traffic to any IP
    address\n   starting with 17.133, but not starting with 17.133.125) would be sent\n
    \  to the level 2 router in the leftmost area.\n"

  - "3.3 Addressing Routers in IS-IS Packets\n   The IS-IS packet formats explicitly
    require that OSI-style addresses\n   of routers appear in the IS-IS packets. For
    example, these addresses\n   are used to determine area membership of routers.
    It is therefore\n   necessary for all routers making use of the IS-IS protocol
    to have\n   OSI style addresses assigned. For IP-only routers, these addresses\n
    \  will be used only in the operation of the IS-IS protocol, and are not\n   used
    for any other purpose (such as the operation of EGP, ICMP, or\n   other TCP/IP
    protocols).\n   For OSI-only and dual routers, assignment of NSAP addresses is\n
    \  straight forward, but is outside of the scope of this specification.\n   Address
    assignment mechanisms are being set up by standards bodies\n   which allow globally
    unique OSI NSAP addresses to be assigned. All\n   OSI-only and dual routers may
    therefore make use of normal OSI\n   addresses in the operation of the IS-IS protocol.\n
    \  For IP-only routers, there are two ways in which NSAP addresses may\n   be
    obtained for use with the IS-IS protocol.\n   1) For those environments in which
    OSI is being used, or in which it\n      is anticipated that OSI will be used
    in the future, it is\n      permissible to obtain NSAP address assignments in
    the normal\n      manner, assign normal NSAP addresses to IP-only routers, and
    use\n      these addresses in the operation of IS-IS. This approach is\n      recommended
    even for pure IP routing domains, as it will simplify\n      future migration
    from IP-only to dual operation.\n   2) In some cases, routers may have only TCP/IP
    addresses, and it may\n      be undesireable to have to go through the normal
    mechanisms for\n      assignment of NSAP addresses. Instead, an alternate mechanim
    is\n      provided below for algorithmically generating a valid OSI style\n      address
    from existing IP address and autonomous system number\n      assignments.\n   Where
    desired, for IP-only routers, for use in IS-IS packet formats\n   only, OSI-style
    addresses (compatible with the USA GOSIP version 2.0\n   NSAP address format [9])
    may be derived as follows:\n        AFI       1 octet       value \"47\" (specifies
    ICD format)\n        ICD       2 octet       value \"00 05\" (specifies Internet/Gosip)\n
    \       DFI       1 octet       value \"xx\"\n        AA        3 octets      value
    \"xx xx xx\" (specifies special\n                                IP-only use of
    NSAPs)\n        Reserved  2 octets      must be \"00 00\"\n        RD        2
    octets      contains autonomous system number\n        Area      2 octets      must
    be assigned as described below\n        ID        6 octets      must be assigned
    as described below\n        SEL       1 octet       used as described below\n
    \  The AFI value of \"47\" and the ICD value of \"00 05\" specifies the\n   Gosip
    Version 2.0 addressing format. The DFI number of \"xx\" and the\n   AA of \"xx
    xx xx\" specify that this special NSAP address format is\n   being used, solely
    for IS-IS packet formats in an IP-only\n   environment. The reserved field must
    contain \"00 00\", as specified in\n   GOSIP version 2.0.\n   The routing domain
    field contains the Autonomous System number.\n   Strictly speaking, this is not
    necessary, since the IS-IS packets are\n   exchanged within a single AS only.
    However, inclusion of the AS\n   number in this address format will ensure correct
    operation in the\n   event that routers from separate routing domains/ASs are
    incorrectly\n   placed on the same link. The AS number in this context is used
    only\n   for definition of unique NSAP addresses, and does not imply any\n   coupling
    with exterior routing protocols.\n   The Area field must be assigned by the authority
    responsible for the\n   routing domain, such that each area in the routing domain
    must have a\n   unique Area value.\n   The ID must be assigned by the authority
    responsible for the routing\n   domain. The ID must be assigned such that every
    router in the routing\n   domain has a unique value. It is recommended that one
    of the\n   following methods is used:\n   1)use a unique IEEE 802 48 bit station
    ID\n   2)use the value hex \"02 00\" prepended to an IP address of the router.\n
    \  IEEE 802 addresses, if used, must appear in IEEE canonical format.\n   Since
    the IEEE 802 station IDs are assigned to be globally unique,\n   use of these
    values clearly assures uniqueness in the area. Also, all\n   assigned IEEE 802
    station IDs have the global/local bit set to zero.\n   Prepending the indicated
    pattern to the front of the IP address\n   therefore assures that format (2) illustrated
    above cannot produce\n   addresses which collide with format (1). Finally, to
    the extent that\n   IP addresses are also globally unique, format (2) will produce
    unique\n   IDs for routers.\n   The indicated hex value is specified in IEEE 802
    canonical form [10].\n   In IEEE 802 addresses, the multicast bit is the least
    significant bit\n   of the first byte. The global/local bit is the next least
    significant\n   bit of the first byte. The indicated prefix therefore sets the\n
    \  global/local bit to 1, and all other bits in the first two octets to\n   0.\n
    \  Note that within an area, whether ISO addresses are configured into\n   the
    routers through ISO address assignment, or whether the ISO-style\n   address is
    generated directly from the AS number and IP address, all\n   routers within an
    area must have the same high order part of address\n   (AFI, ICD, DFI, AA, RD,
    and Area). This ISO-style address is used in\n   IS-IS Hello messages and is the
    basis by which routers recognize\n   whether neighbor nodes are in or out of their
    area.\n"

  - "3.4 External Links\n   External connectivity (i.e., communications with routers
    outside of\n   the routing domain) is done only by level 2 routers. The ISO version\n
    \  of IS-IS allows external OSI routes to be reported as \"reachable\n   address
    prefixes\" in level 2 LSPs. The integrated IS-IS also allows\n   external IP reachable
    addresses (i.e., IP addresses reachable via\n   inter-domain routing) to be reported
    in level 2 LSPs in the \"IP\n   external reachability information\" field. External
    OSI and external\n   IP routes are handled independently.\n   The routes announced
    in IP external reachability information entries\n   include all routes to outside
    of the routing domain. This includes\n   routes learned from OSPF, EGP, RIP, or
    any other external protocol.\n   External routes may make use of \"internal\"
    or \"external\" metrics.\n   Internal metrics are comparable with the metrics
    used for internal\n   routes. Thus in choosing between an internal route, and
    an external\n   route using internal metrics, the metric values may be directly\n
    \  compared. In contrast, external metrics cannot be directly compared\n   with
    internal metrics. Any route defined solely using internal\n   metrics is always
    preferred to any route defined using external\n   metrics. When an external route
    using external metrics must be used,\n   the lowest value of the external metric
    is preferred regardless of\n   the internal cost to reach the appropriate exit
    point.\n   It is useful, in the operation of external routing protocols, to\n
    \  provide a mechanism for border routers (i.e., routers in the same\n   routing
    domain, which have the ability to route externally to other\n   domains) to determine
    each other's existence, and to exchange\n   external information (in a form understood
    only by the border routers\n   themselves). This is made possible by inclusion
    of \"inter-domain\n   routing protocol information\" fields in level 2 LSPs. The
    inter-\n   domain routing protocol information field is not included in\n   pseudonode
    LSPs.\n   In general there may be multiple types of external inter-domain\n   routing
    protocol information exchanged between border routers. The\n   IS-IS therefore
    specifies that each occurance of the inter-domain\n   routing protocol information
    field include a \"type\" field, which\n   indicates the type of inter-domain routing
    protocol information\n   enclosed. Values to be used in the type field will be
    specified in\n   future versions of the \"Assigned Numbers\" RFC. Initial values
    for\n   this field are specified in Annex A of this specification.\n   Information
    contained in the inter-domain routing protocol\n   information field will be carried
    in level 2 LSPs, and will therefore\n   need to be stored by all level 2 routers
    in the domain. However, only\n   those level 2 routers which are directly involved
    in external routing\n   will use this information. In designing the use of this
    field, it is\n   important to carefully consider the implications that this may
    have\n   on storage requirements in level 2 routers (including those level 2\n
    \  routers which are not directly involved in external routing).\n   The protocols
    used to exchange routing information directly between\n   border routers, and
    external routers (in other routing domains /\n   autonomous systems) are outside
    of the scope of this specification.\n"

  - "3.5 Type of Service Routing\n   The integrated IS-IS protocol provides IP Type
    of Service (TOS)\n   routing, through use of the Quality of Service (QOS) feature
    of IS-\n   IS. This allows for routing on the basis of throughput (the default\n
    \  metric), delay, expense, or residual error probability. Note than any\n   particular
    packet may be routed on the basis of any one of these four\n   metrics. Routing
    on the basis of general combinations of metrics is\n   not supported.\n   The
    support for TOS/QOS is optional. If a particular packet calls for\n   a specific
    TOS, and the correct path from the source to destination\n   is made up of routers
    all of which support that particular TOS, then\n   the packet will be routed on
    the optimal path. However, if there is\n   no path from the source to destination
    made up of routers which\n   support that particular type of service, then the
    packet will be\n   forwarded using the default metric instead. This allows for
    TOS\n   service in those environments where it is needed, while still\n   providing
    acceptable service in the case where an unsupported TOS is\n   requested.\n   NOTE
    - IP does not have a cost TOS. There is therefore no mapping of\n   IP TOS metrics
    which corresponds to the minimum cost metric.\n   The IP TOS field is mapped onto
    the four available metrics as\n   follows:\n   Bits 0-2 (Precedence):  This field
    does not affect the route, but\n                           rather may affect other
    aspects of packet\n                           forwarding.\n   Bits 3 (Delay),
    4 (Throughput) and 5 (Reliability):\n           000     (all normal)            Use
    default metric\n           100     (low delay)             Use delay metric\n
    \          010     (high throughput)       Use default metric\n           001

    State Packets and\n   Complete Sequence Number Packets) may be too large to fit
    into one\n   packet. The OSI IS-IS [1] allows for LSPs and CSNPs to be split into\n
    \  multiple packets. This is independent of ISO 8473 segmentation, and\n   is
    also independent of IP fragmentation. Use of independent multiple\n   packets
    has the advantages (with respect to segmentation or\n   fragmentation) that: (i)
    when information in the IS-IS changes, only\n   those packets effected need to
    be re-issued; (ii) when a single\n   packet is received, it can be processed without
    the need to receive\n   all other packets of the same type from the same router
    before\n   beginning processing.\n   The Integrated IS-IS makes use of the same
    multiple packet function,\n   as defined in [1]. IP-specific fields in IS-IS packets
    may be split\n   across multiple packets. As specified in section 5 (\"Structure
    and\n   Encoding of PDUs\"), some of the IP-specific fields (those which may\n
    \  be fairly long) may be split into several occurences of the same\n   field,
    thereby allowing splitting of the fields across different\n   packets.\n   Multiple
    LSPs from the same router are distinguished by LSP number.\n   Generally, most
    variable length fields may occur in an LSP with any\n   LSP number. Some specific
    variable length fields may be required to\n   occur in LSP number 0. Except where
    explicitly stated otherwise, when\n   an IS-IS router issues multiple LSPs, the
    IP-specific fields may\n   occur in an LSP with any LSP number.\n   Complete Sequence
    Number Packets may be split into multiple packets,\n   with the range to which
    each packet applies explicitly reported in\n   the packet. Partial Sequence Number
    Packets are inherently partial,\n   and so can easily be split into multiple packets

  - "3.10 Order of Preference of Routes / Dijkstra Computation\n   We define the term
    \"IP reachability entry\" to mean the combination of\n   the [IP address, subnet
    mask]. The Dijkstra calculation must\n   calculate routes to each distinct IP
    reachability entry. For the\n   Dijkstra calculation, each IP reachability entry
    can be treated in\n   much the same manner as an OSI end system. Naturally, each
    IP\n   reachability entry is treated as distinct from any OSI end systems\n   which
    may also be reachable in the same area or routing domain.\n   For any particular
    IP reachability entry, this is the same as another\n   entry if and only if: (i)
    the subnet masks are identical; and (ii)\n   for each bit in the subnet mask which
    has the value \"1\", the IP\n   address is identical. This can easily be tested
    by zeroing those bits\n   in the IP address which correspond to a zero bit in
    the mask, and\n   then treating the entry as a 64 bit quantity, and testing for\n
    \  equality between different 64 bit quantities. The actual calculation\n   of
    routes to IP reachability entries is therefore no more complex\n   than calculation
    of routes to OSI end systems (except for the\n   replacement of a 48-bit test
    with a 64-bit test).\n   The Dijkstra computation does not take into consideration
    whether a\n   router is IP-only, OSI-only, or dual. The topological restrictions\n
    \  specified in section 1.4 ensure that IP packets will only be sent via\n   IP-capable
    routers, and OSI packets will only be sent via OSI-capable\n   routers.\n   The
    Integrated IS-IS prefers routes within the area (via level 1\n   routing) whenever
    possible. If level 2 routes must be used, then\n   routes within the routing domain
    (specifically, those routes using\n   internal metrics) are prefered to routes
    outside of the routing\n   domain (using external metrics).\n   The Integrated
    IS-IS protocol makes use of \"best match\" routing of IP\n   packets. This implies
    that a particular destination address may match\n   more than one entry in the
    forwarding database. If a particular IP\n   packet has a destination address which
    matches two different IP\n   reachability entries, then the entry who's mask contains
    the most \"1\"\n   bits is preferred.\n   IP packets whose destination is a router
    are routed the same way as\n   any other IP packet, by forwarding first to the
    appropriate subnet,\n   and then forwarding on that subnet to the destination
    host (which\n   just happens to be a router in this case). In particular, the
    IP\n   forwarding database does not contain explicit routes to the\n   individual
    \"IP interface addresses\" listed by each router in its LSP.\n   However, host
    routes (routes with a subnet mask of all ones) may of\n   course be included in
    the IP reachability entries, and will be\n   handled in the same manner as other
    IP reachability entries.\n   In order to ensure correct interoperation of different
    router\n   implementations, it is necessary to specify the order of preference\n
    \  of possible routes. For OSI destinations, this is outside of the\n   scope
    of this report. For IP destinations, this is specified in\n   section 3.10.1 and
    3.10.2 below. Annex C specifies a detailed\n   Dijkstra calculation and forwarding
    algorithm which is compatible\n   with the order of preference of routes specified
    here.\n   With IS-IS, if a route to a given destination is advertised, or a\n
    \  link between routers is advertised, then metric values associated\n   with
    some or all of the specified TOS metric types may be associated\n   with that
    destination or link. However, the default metric must\n   always be available.
    Normally this ensures that if a route using any\n   TOS metric is available, then
    a route using the default metric will\n   also be available. The only exception
    to this is where the\n   corresponding route using the default metric has a total
    cost (within\n   the area, or within the level 2 backbone) greater than MaxPathMetric.\n
    \  In determining the route to a particular destination for a specified\n   TOS,
    only routes using either the requested TOS metric, or the\n   default TOS metric,
    are considered.\n"

  - "3.10.2 Order of Preference of Routes in Level 2 Routing\n   For those level 2
    routers which also take part in level 1 routing,\n   routes learned via level
    1 routing, using either the requested TOS or\n   the default TOS, are always prefered
    to routes learned through level\n   2 routing. For destinations which are not
    reachable via level 1\n   routing, or for level 2 only routers (routers which
    do not take part\n   in level 1 routing), then level 2 routes are selected as
    follows:\n   1) Routes using internal metrics only are always preferred\n      to
    routes using external metrics.\n   2) If a route using internal metrics only is
    available:\n      a) If the specified destination address matches more\n         than
    one [IP address, subnet mask] pair, then the more\n         specific address match
    (i.e., the largest number of\n         \"1\"s present in the subnet mask) is prefered.\n
    \     b) Amongst routes with equally specific address matches\n         (i.e.,
    an equal number of \"1\"s present in the subnet\n         mask), routes on which
    the requested TOS (if any) is\n         supported are always preferred to routes
    on which the\n         requested TOS is not supported.\n      c) Amongst routes
    of the same TOS with an equally specific\n         address matches, the shortest
    path is prefered. For\n         determination of the shortest path, if a route
    on which\n         the specified TOS is supported is available, then the\n         specified
    TOS metric is used, otherwise the default\n         metric is used. Amongst routes
    of equal cost,\n         loadsplitting may be performed as specified in [1].\n
    \        NOTE: Internal routes (routes to destinations announced\n         in
    the \"IP Internal Reachability Information\" field),\n         and external routes
    using internal metrics (routes to\n         destinations announced in the \"IP
    External Reachability\n         Information\" field, with a metric of type \"internal\")\n
    \        are treated identically for the purpose of the order of\n         preference
    of routes, and the Dijkstra calculation.\n   3) If a route using internal metrics
    only is not available,\n      but a route using external metrics is available:\n
    \     a) If the specified destination address matches more than\n         one
    [IP address, subnet mask] pair, then the more\n         specific address match
    is prefered.\n         NOTE: For external routes, the subnet mask will normally\n
    \        correspond precisely to the network number. This implies\n         that
    this test will always discover equal length matching\n         strings.  However,
    this test is included to allow future\n         migration to more general handling
    of external addresses.\n      b) Amongst routes with equally specific matches,
    routes on\n         which the requested TOS (if any) is supported are always\n
    \        preferred to routes on which the requested TOS is not\n         supported.
    NOTE: for external routes, the route is\n         considered to support the requested
    TOS only if the\n         internal route to the appropriate border router\n         supports
    the requested TOS, and the external route\n         reported by the border router
    also supports the\n         requested TOS.\n      c) Amongst routes of the same
    TOS with an equal length\n         matching address string, the shortest path
    is prefered.\n         For determination of the shortest path:\n         (i)  Routes
    with a smaller announced external metric\n              are always prefered.\n
    \        (ii) Amongst routes with an equal external metric,\n              routes
    with a shorter internal metric are prefered.\n              Amongst routes of
    equal cost, loadsplitting may be\n              performed as specified in [1].\n
    \  For level 2 routers which are announcing manually configured summary\n   addresses
    in their level 2 LSPs, in some cases there will exist IP\n   addresses which match
    the manually configured addresses, but which do\n   not match any addresses which
    are actually reachable via level 1\n   routing in the area. Generally, packets
    to such addresses are handled\n   according to the following rules:\n   1) If
    the specified destination is reachable via level 1 routing,\n      then according
    to the order of preference of routes specified\n      above, the packet will be
    delivered via level 1 routing.\n   2) If the specified destination is not reachable
    via level 1 routing,\n      but is reachable via 2 routing, and there are other
    level 2\n      routers which offer more desireable routes according to the\n      rules
    specified above (for example a route with a more specific\n      match, or a route
    with an equally specific match which supports\n      the correct TOS), then level
    2 routing will forward the packet\n      according to the more desireable route.\n
    \  3) If the specified destination is not reachable via level 1 routing,\n      and
    the manually configured summary address advertised by this\n      router (the
    router which has received the packet and is trying\n      to forward it) represents
    the most desireable route, then the\n      destination is unreachable and the
    packet must be discarded.\n"

  - "4.1 Link Demultiplexing\n   Dual routers may receive a combination of OSI packets,
    and IP\n   packets. It is necessary for the dual routers to be able to clearly\n
    \  and unambiguously distinguish the two protocol suites.\n   This problem is
    not unique to the integrated IS-IS routing protocol.\n   In fact, this problem
    will occur in any multi-protocol environment.\n   This problem is currently being
    worked on independently, and is\n   outside of the scope of this specification.\n
    \  In general, the link type is a configuration parameter. For example,\n   whether
    to use PPP, HDLC, or some other point-to-point protocol over\n   a point-to-point
    link would be configured. For any particular link\n   type, a method must be defined
    for encapsulation of both OSI and IP\n   packets. Definition of such methods for
    common link types is outside\n   of the scope of this specification.\n   IP packets
    are encapsulated directly over the underlying link layer\n   service, using the
    normal method for transmssion of IP packets over\n   each type of link. Similarly
    OSI packets are encapsulated directly\n   over the underlying link layer service,
    using the normal method for\n   transmission of OSI packets over each type of
    link. Finally, note\n   that IS-IS packets are encapsulated using the normal method
    for\n   transmission of OSI packets over any particular link type. This\n   implies
    that all IS-IS routers, including IP-only routers, must be\n   able to receive
    IS-IS packets using the normal encapsulation for OSI\n   packets.\n"

  - "4.2 Multiple IP Addresses per Interface\n   The integrated IS-IS allows each
    router to have multiple IP addresses\n   for each physical interface, up to the
    maximum number which may be\n   contained in a single \"IP Interface Address\"
    field (i.e., up to a\n   maximum of 63 addresses per interface). For example,
    where there are\n   two logical subnets on the same LAN, the interface may have
    two IP\n   addresses, one corresponding to each logical subnet. Each IS-IS Hello\n
    \  packet contains a list of IP addresses associated with the physical\n   interface
    over which the Hello is transmitted.\n   It is permissible to implement routers
    which conform to the\n   Integrated IS-IS specification which restrict the number
    of IP\n   addresses per interface. However, IP-capable routers must be able to\n
    \  interact correctly with other routers which assign multiple IP\n   addresses
    per physical interface (up to the maximum of 63 addresses\n   per interface).\n
    \  Where appropriate (for example, in some cases on point-to-point\n   links),
    some interfaces may have no IP addresses assigned. In this\n   case, the IS-IS
    Hello transmitted on that interface may omit the IP\n   Interface Address field,
    or may include the IP Interface Address\n   field with zero entries.\n"

  - "4.3 LANs, Designated Routers, and Pseudonodes\n   The maintenance of designated
    routers and pseudonodes is specified in\n   [1], and is not changed by this proposal.
    In the case that IP-only\n   and dual routers (or OSI-only and dual routers) are
    mixed on the same\n   LAN in a pure IP area (or a pure OSI area, respectively),
    any router\n   on the LAN may be elected designated router.\n   However, there
    is a fundamental difference in the way that OSI and\n   TCP/IP deal with LANs,
    and other broadcast subnetworks.\n   With OSI, the use of the ES-IS protocol (ISO
    9542) allows the end\n   systems and routers to automatically determine their
    connectivity,\n   thereby allowing all end systems on the LAN to potentially route
    via\n   any of the routers on the LAN.\n   In contract, TCP/IP explictly assigns
    subnet identifiers to each\n   local area network. In some cases, a single physical
    LAN could have\n   multiple subnet identifiers assigned to it. In this case, end
    systems\n   (hosts) which have an address on one logical subnet are explicitly\n
    \  precluded from sending IP packets directly to a router whose address\n   places
    it on a different logical subnet. Each router is manually\n   configured to know
    which subnets it can reach on each interface. In\n   the case that there are multiple
    logical subnets on the same LAN,\n   each router can only exchange IP packets
    with those end systems which\n   are on the same logical subnet. This implies
    that it is not\n   sufficient for the pseudonode LSP to announce all subnets on
    the LAN\n   (i.e., all [IP address, subnet mask] pairs reachable on the LAN).\n
    \  It is therefore necessary for each router to announce in its LSPs\n   those
    subnets which it can reach on each interface, including\n   interfaces to broadcast
    subnetworks such as LANs. The pseudonode LSP\n   does not specify the IP addresses
    which are reachable on the LAN\n   (i.e., does not contain the the IP reachability
    field).\n   As specified elsewhere (see the forthcoming update to the\n   \"Requirements
    of IP Gateways\" [4]), routers may send ICMP redirects\n   only if: (i) the IP
    packet is being forwarded over the same physical\n   interface over which it arrived;
    and (ii) the source address of the\n   forwarded IP packet, the IP address of
    this router's interface (as\n   indicated by the source address of the ICMP redirect),
    and the IP\n   address of the router to which the packet is being redirected (again,\n
    \  as indicated in the ICMP redirect) are all on the same IP subnet.\n"

  - "4.4 Maintaining Router Adjacencies\n   The IS-IS determines whether an adjacency
    is to be established\n   between two routers using means which are independent
    of the IP\n   interface addresses of the routers. Where multiple logical subnets\n
    \  occur on the same physical LAN, this potentially allows adjacencies\n   to
    be brought up between two routers which share physical\n   connectivity to each
    other, but which don't have a logical subnet in\n   common. IP-capable IS-IS routers
    therefore must be able to forward IP\n   packets over existing adjacencies to
    routers with which they share\n   physical connectivity, even when the IP address
    of the adjacent\n   interface of the neighboring router is on a different logical
    IP\n   subnet.\n   For point-to-point links, IS-IS requires exchange of ISO 9542
    ISHs,\n   as the first step in establishing the link between routers. All IS-IS\n
    \  routers are therefore required to transmit and receive ISO 9542 ISH\n   packets
    on point-to-point links.\n   The \"protocols supported\" field (defined in section
    5 below) must be\n   present in all IS-IS Hello packets sent by dual and IP-only
    routers.\n   If this field is missing, then it is assumed that the packet was\n
    \  transmitted by an OSI-only router. Similarly, those 9542 ISHs sent\n   over
    point-to-point links, where there is (or may be) another IS-IS\n   router at the
    other end of the point-to-point link, must also\n   contains the \"protocols supported\"
    field. Note that if this field is\n   mistakenly sent in a 9542 ISH where there
    is an ordinary OSI-only End\n   System at the other end of the link, then (in
    accordance to ISO 9542)\n   the End System is required to ignore the field and
    interpret the ISH\n   correctly. It is therefore safe to always include this field
    in ISHs\n   sent over point-to-point links.\n   Dual routers must operate in a
    dual fashion on every link in the\n   routing domain over which they are running
    IS-IS. Thus, the value of\n   the \"protocols supported\" field must be identical
    on every link\n   (i.e., for any one router running IS-IS, all of the Hellos and
    LSPs\n   transmitted by it must contain the same \"protocols supported\"\n   values).\n"

  - "4.5 Forwarding to Incompatible Routers\n   There may be times when a dual router
    has to forward an IP packet to\n   an OSI-only router, or forward an OSI packet
    to an IP-only router. In\n   this case the packet must be discarded. An error
    report may be\n   transmitted, in accordance with the IP or ISO 8473 specification\n
    \  (respectively). The reason for discard specified in the error report\n   should
    specify \"destination host unreachable\" (for IP), or\n   \"destination unreachable\"
    (for OSI).\n   Similarly, due to errors, in some cases an IP-only router may have
    to\n   forward an IP packet to an OSI-only router. Again, the packet must be\n
    \  discarded, as specified above. This may only occur if IP-only and\n   OSI-only

  - "5.1 Overview of IS-IS PDUs\n   The packets used in IS-IS routing protocol fall
    into three main\n   classes: (i) Hello Packets; (ii) Link State Packets (LSPs);
    and (iii)\n   Sequence Number Packets (SNPs).\n   Hello packets are used to initialize
    and maintain adjacencies between\n   neighboring routers. There are three types
    of IS-IS Hello packets:\n   (i) \"Level 1 LAN IS to IS Hello PDUs\" are used by
    level 1 routers on\n   broadcast LANs. (ii) \"Level 2 LAN IS to IS Hello PDUs\"
    are used by\n   level 2 routers on broadcast LANs. (iii) \"Point-to-Point IS to
    IS\n   Hello PDUs\" are used on non-broadcast media, such as point-to-point\n
    \  links, or general topology subnetworks.\n   On point-to-point links, the exchange
    of ISO 9542 ISHs (intermediate\n   system Hellos) is used to initialize the link,
    and to allow each\n   router to know if there is a router on the other end of
    the link,\n   before IS-IS Hellos are exchanged. All routers implementing IS-IS\n
    \  (whether IP-only, OSI-only, or dual), if they have any interfaces on\n   point-to-point
    links, must therefore be able to transmit ISO 9542\n   ISHs on their point-to-point
    links.\n   Link State Packets (LSPs) are used to exchange link state\n   information.
    There are two types of LSPs: (i) \"Level 1 Link State\n   PDUs\" are transmitted
    by level 1 routers. (ii) \"Level 2 Link State\n   PDUs\" are transmitted by level
    2 routers. Note that level 2 routers\n   will, in most cases, also be level 1
    routers, and will therefore\n   transmit both sorts of LSPs.\n   Sequence number
    PDUs are used to ensure that neighboring routers have\n   the same notion of what
    is the most recent LSP from each other\n   router. The sequence number PDUs therefore
    serve a similar function\n   to acknowledgement packets, but allow more efficient
    operation. There\n   are four types of sequence number packets: (i) \"Level 1
    Complete\n   Sequence Numbers PDU\"; (ii) \"Level 2 Complete Sequence Numbers
    PDU\";\n   (iii) \"Level 1 Partial Sequence Numbers PDU\"; and (iv) \"Level 2\n
    \  Partial Sequence Numbers PDU\". A partial sequence number packet lists\n   the
    most recent sequence number of one or more LSPs, and operates\n   much like an
    acknowlegement. A partial sequence number packet differs\n   from an conventional
    acknowledgement in the sense that it may\n   acknowlege multiple LSPs at once,
    and in the sense that it may act as\n   a request for information. A complete
    sequence number packet contains\n   the most recent sequence number of all LSPs
    in the database. A\n   complete sequence number packet may therefore be used to
    ensure\n   synchronization of the database between adjacent routers either\n   periodically,
    or when a link first comes up.\n"

  - "5.2 Overview of IP-Specific Information for IS-IS\n   There are six new fields
    defined for the Integrated IS-IS: (i)\n   \"Protocols Supported\"; (ii) \"IP Interface
    Address\"; (iii)\n   \"Authentication Information\"; (iv) \"IP Internal Reachability\n
    \  Information\"; (v) \"IP External Reachability Information\"; and (vi)\n   \"Inter-Domain
    Routing Protocol Information\".\n   The \"Protocols Supported\" field identifies
    the protocols which are\n   supported by each router. This field must be included
    in all IS-IS\n   Hello packets and all LSPs with LSP number 0 transmitted by IP-\n
    \  capable routers. If this field is not included in an IS-IS Hello\n   packet
    or an LSP with LSP number 0, it may be assumed that the packet\n   was transmitted
    by an OSI-only router. The \"Protocols Supported\"\n   field must also be included
    in ISO 9542 ISHs send by IP-capable\n   routers over point-to-point links to other
    IS-IS routers.\n   The \"IP Interface Address\" is included in all IS-IS Hello
    packets and\n   LSPs transmitted by IP-only and dual routers. In the Hello packets,\n
    \  this field occurs once only, and contains the IP address(es) of the\n   interface
    on which the Hello packet is transmitted (up to a maximum\n   of 63 IP addresses
    on each interface). If an IS-IS Hello is\n   transmitted over an interface which
    does not have an IP address\n   assigned, then this field may be omitted, or may
    be included with\n   zero entries. In Link State Packets, this field contains
    a list of\n   one or more IP addresses corresponding to one or more interfaces
    of\n   the router which originates the LSP. Each IP-capable router must\n   include
    this field in its LSPs. This field may occur multiple times\n   in an LSP, and
    may occur in an LSP with any LSP number.\n   The \"Authentication Information\"
    field is optional in all IS-IS PDUs.\n   If used, it contains information used
    to authenticate the packet. All\n   IS-IS packets (including 9542 IS Hellos) may
    be authenticated by use\n   of this field.\n   The \"IP Internal Reachability
    Information\" field may be present in\n   all LSPs transmitted by IP-capable routers.
    If present, it identifies\n   a list of zero or more [IP address, subnet mask,
    metrics] reachable\n   by the router which originates the LSP. Each entry must
    contain a\n   default metric, and may contain delay, expense, and error metrics.
    If\n   an IP-capable router does not directly reach any IP addresses, then\n   it
    may omit this field, or may include the field with zero [IP\n   address, subnet
    mask, metrics] entries. If included in level 1 LSPs,\n   this field includes only
    entries directly reachable by the router\n   which originates the LSP, via one
    of its interfaces. If included in\n   level 2 LSPs, this field includes only entries
    reachable by the\n   router which originates the LSP, either via one of its interfaces,
    or\n   indirectly via level 1 routing. This field may occur multiple times\n   in
    an LSP, and may occur in an LSP with any LSP number.\n   The \"IP External Reachability
    Information\" field may be present in\n   level 2 LSPs transmitted by level 2
    IP-capable routers. If present,\n   it identifies a list of zero or more [IP address,
    subnet mask,\n   metrics] entries reachable by the router which originates the
    level 2\n   LSP. Each entry must contain a default metric, and may contain delay,\n
    \  expense, and error metrics. Each entry may contain metrics of type\n   \"internal\",
    or of type \"external\". If a level 2 router does not have\n   any external routes
    (via neighboring routers in other routing\n   domains), when it may omit this
    field, or may include the field with\n   zero entries. This field includes only
    entries reachable by the\n   router which originates the LSP, via a direct link
    to an external\n   router. This field may occur multiple times in a level 2 LSP,
    and may\n   occur in an LSP with any LSP number.\n   The \"Inter-Domain Routing
    Protocol Information\" field may be present\n   in level 2 LSPs transmitted by
    level 2 IP-capable routers. This field\n   is transmitted for the convenience
    of the external routing protocol,\n   and is not used by the IS-IS. For example,
    this may be used to allow\n   border routers to find each other. This field may
    occur multiple\n   times in a level 2 LSP, and may occur in an LSP with any LSP
    number.\n   The DP 10589 version of the OSI IS-IS does not currently allow\n   addition
    of TLV-encoded variable length fields to Sequence Number\n   Packets. However,
    this is being corrected in future versions of\n   10589. In addition, this is
    expected to be the only correction to\n   future versions of 10589 that is not
    backward-compatible with the DP\n   version. The Integrated IS-IS therefore makes
    use of a corrected\n   version of DP 10589, such that the encoding of SNPs has
    been fixed.\n   The correct encoding of sequence number packets (as is expected
    to\n   appear in future versions of ISO 10589) is given in Annex B of this\n   specification.\n

  - "6 Security Considerations\n   The integrated IS-IS has a provision for carrying
    authentication\n   information in all IS-IS packets. This is extensible to multiple\n
    \  authentication mechanisms. However, currently the only defined\n   mechanism
    is a simple password, transmitted in the clear without\n   encryption (see Annex
    D). The use of a simple password does not\n   provide useful protection against
    intentional misbehavior. Rather,\n   this should be thought of as a weak protection
    against accidental\n   errors such as accidental mis-configuration. Definition
    of other\n   authentication mechanisms is beyond the scope of this document.\n

    Number Packets\n   The Integrated IS-IS protocol defined in this specification
    makes use\n   of the ISO Draft Proposed standard for Intra-domain routing (ISO
    DP\n   10589 [1]) as the base routing protocol, upon which IP support may be\n
    \  added.\n   However, DP 10589 contains a bug regarding encoding of the variable\n
    \  length fields in Sequence Number Packets. In particular, DP 10589\n   encodes
    the variable length fields in SNPs in a manner which is not\n   flexible (additional
    variable length fields cannot be defined for\n   sequence number packets), and
    which is inconsistent with the encoding\n   of the variable length fields in all
    other IS-IS and ES-IS packets.\n   The encoding of the variable length fields
    in SNPs is expected to be\n   fixed in future versions of 10589. Also, this bug
    represents the only\n   expected change to 10589 which cannot be made backward
    compatible\n   with existing DP 10589 implementations. For these reasons, the\n
    \  current version of the Integrated IS-IS will use the anticipated\n   future
    encoding of the variable length part of the SNPs. This should\n   allow future
    versions of this specification to be compatible with\n   implementations based
    on this specification.\n   This annex specifies the encoding of SNPs, as amended
    to fix the\n   encoding of variable length fields. This annex is an integral part
    of\n   the Integrated IS-IS specification.\n   The encoding of SNPs for OSI-only
    use is shown in this section. For\n   IP-only or Integrated use, the additional
    variable length fields\n   specified in sections 5.3.6 through 5.3.9 are also
    applicable to\n   SNPs.\n"

  - "C.1 SPF Algorithm for IP and Dual Use\n   This section specifies an SPF Algorithm
    for calculating routes with\n   the IS-IS routing protocol, for support of both
    TCP/IP and OSI. This\n   is based on an extention to the algorithm specified in
    annex C.2 of\n   ISO DP 10589 [1].\n   An algorithm invented by Dijkstra known
    as shortest path first (SPF)\n   is used as the basis for the route calculation.
    It has a\n   computational complexity of the square of the number of nodes, which\n
    \  can be decreased to the number of links in the domain times the log\n   of
    the number of nodes for sparse networks (networks which are not\n   highly connected).\n
    \  A number of additional optimizations are possible:\n   1) If the routing metric
    is defined over a small finite field (as in\n      this standard), the factor
    of log n may be removed by using data\n      structures which maintain a separate
    list of systems for each value\n      of the metric rather than sorting the systems
    by logical distance.\n   2) Updates can be performed incrementally without requiring
    a complete\n      recalculation. However, a full update must be done periodically
    to\n      ensure recovery from data corruption, and studies suggest that with\n
    \     a very small number of link changes (perhaps 2) the expected\n      computation
    complexity of the incremental update exceeds the\n      complete recalculation.
    Thus, this annex specifies the algorithm\n      only for the full update.\n   3)
    If only End System LSP information has changed, it is not necessary\n      to
    re-compute the entire Dijkstra tree. If the proper data\n      structures are
    used, End Systems (including IP reachability\n      entries) may be attached and
    detached as leaves of the tree and\n      their forwarding information base entries
    altered as appropriate.\n   The original SPF algorithm does not support load splitting
    over\n   multiple paths. The algorithm in this annex does permit load\n   splitting
    by identifying a set of equal cost paths to each\n   destination rather than a
    single least cost path.\n"

    paths\n  from the system S performing the calculation. It is stored as a set\n
    \ of triples of the form <N,d(N),{Adj(N)}>, where:\n      N is a system identifier.
    In the level 1 algorithm, N is a\n      6 octet ID for OSI end systems, a 7 octet
    ID for routers, or\n      an 8 octet IP Internal Reachability Information entry.
    For a\n      router which is not a pseudonode, it is the 6 octet system ID,\n
    \     with a 0 appended octet. For a pseudonode it is a true 7 octet\n      quantity,
    comprised of the 6 octet Designated Intermediate\n      System ID and the extra
    octet assigned by the Destinated Router.\n      The IP Internal Reachability Information
    entries consist of a\n      4 octet IP address plus a 4 octet subnet mask, and
    will always\n      be a leaf, i.e., \"End System\" in PATHS.\n      In the level
    2 algorithm, N is either a 7 octet router or\n      pseudonode ID (as in the level
    1 algorithm); a variable\n      length OSI address prefix; an 8 octet IP Internal
    Reachability\n      Information Entry, or an 8 octet IP External Reachability\n
    \     Information entry. The variable length OSI address prefixes,\n      and
    8 octet IP Reachability Information entries will always\n      be a leaf, i.e.,
    \"End System\" in PATHS. As above, the IP\n      Reachability Information entries
    consist of an [IP address,\n      subnet mask] combination.\n      d(N) is N's
    distance from S (i.e., the total metric value\n      from N to S).\n      {Adj(N)}
    is a set of valid adjacencies that S may use for\n      forwarding to N.\n   When
    a system is placed on PATHS, the path(s) designated by its\n   position in the
    graph is guaranteed to be a shortest path.\n  TENT -- This is a list of triples
    of the form <N,d(N),{Adj(N)}>,\n  where N, d(N), and {Adj(N)} are as defined above
    for PATHS.\n  TENT can intuitively be thought of as a tentative placement\n  of
    a system in PATHS. In other words, the triple <N,x,{A}>\n  in TENT means that
    if N were placed in PATHS, d(N) would be x,\n  but N cannot be placed on PATHS
    until is is guaranteed that\n  no path shorter than x exists.\n  Similarly, the
    triple <N,x,{A,B}> in TENT means that if N\n  were placed in PATHS, then d(N)
    would be x via either\n  adjacency A or B.\n   Note: It is suggested that the
    implementation maintain the database\n   TENT as a set of list of triples of the
    form <*,Dist,*>, sorted by\n   distance Dist. In addition, it is necessary to
    be able to process\n   those systems which are pseudonodes before any non-pseudonodes
    at the\n   same distance Dist.\n   The 8 octet system identifiers which specify
    IP reachability entries\n   must always be distinguishable from other system identifiers.
    As\n   specified in section 3.10, two IP reachability entries which differ\n   only
    in the subnet mask are still considered to be separate, and will\n   therefore
    have distinct system identifiers N. The SPF algorithm will\n   therefore calculate
    routes to each such entry, and the correct entry\n   will be selected in the forwarding
    process.\n"

    to external metrics. For external\n   routes (routes to destinations outside of
    the routing domain), the\n   cost d(N) of the path from N to S may include both
    internal and\n   external metrics. d(N) may therefore be maintained as a two-\n
    \  dimensioned vector quantity (specifying internal and external metric\n   values).\n
    \  d(N) is initialized to [internal metric = 0, external metric = 0].\n   In incrementing
    d(N) by 1, if the internal metric value is less than\n   the maximum value MaxPathMetric,
    then the internal metric value is\n   incremented by one and the external metric
    value left unchanged; if\n   the internal metric value is equal to the maximum
    value\n   MaxPathMetric, then the internal metric value is set to 0 and the\n
    \  external metric value is incremented by 1. Note that this can be\n   implemented
    in a straightforward manner by maintaining the external\n   metric as the high
    order bits of the distance.\n   In the code of the algorithm below, the current
    path length is held\n   in the variable \"tentlength\". This variable is a two-dimensional\n
    \  quantity tentlength=[internal metric, external metric], and is used\n   for

    is incremented in the same manner as d(N).\n"

  - "C.1.3 Overview of the Algorithm\n   The basic algorithm, which builds PATHS from
    scratch, starts out by\n   putting the system doing the computation on PATHS (no
    shorter path to\n   SELF can possibly exist). TENT is then pre-loaded from the
    local\n   adjacency database.\n   Note that a system is not placed on PATHS unless
    no shorter path to\n   that system exists. When a system N is placed on PATHS,
    the path to\n   each neighbor M of N, through N, is examined, as the path to N
    plus\n   the link from N to M. If <M,*,*> is in PATHS, this new path will be\n
    \  longer, and thus ignored.\n   If <M,*,*> is in TENT, and the new path is shorter,
    the old entry is\n   removed from TENT and the new path is placed in TENT. If
    the new path\n   is the same length as the one in TENT, then the set of potential\n
    \  adjacencies {Adj(M)} is set to the union of the old set (in TENT) and\n   the
    new set {Adj(N)}. If M is not in TENT, then the path is added to\n   TENT.\n   Next
    the algorithm finds the triple <N,x,{Adj(N)}> in TENT, with\n   minimal x. Note:
    This is done efficiently because of the optimization\n   described above. When
    the list of triples for distance Dist is\n   exhausted, the algorithm then increments
    Dist until it finds a list\n   with a triple of the form <*,Dist,*>.\n   N is
    placed in PATHS. We know that no path to N can be shorter than x\n   at this point
    because all paths through systems already in PATHS have\n   already been considered,
    and paths through systems in TENT still have\n   to be greater than x because
    x is minimal in TENT.\n   When TENT is empty, PATHS is complete.\n   Note that
    external metrics can only occur in \"IP External\n   Reachability Information\"
    entries, which correspond to a leaf (i.e.,\n   End System in PATHS). Any route
    utilizing an entry with an external\n   metric will always be considered to be
    less desireable than any entry\n   which uses an internal metric. This implies
    that in the addition of\n   systems to PATHS, all systems reachable via internal
    routes are\n   always added before any system reachable via external routes.\n"

  - "C.1.4 The Algorithm\n   The Decision Process Algorithm must be run once for each
    supported\n   routing metric (i.e., for each supported Type of Service). A level
    1\n   router runs the algorithm using the level 1 LSP database to compute\n   level
    1 paths (for those level 1 routers which are not level 2\n   routers, this includes
    the path to the nearest attached level 2\n   router). Level 2 routers also separately
    run the algorithm using the\n   level 2 LSP database to compute level 2 paths.
    IP-capable level 2\n   routers must keep level 2 internal IP routes separate from
    level 2\n   external IP routes.\n   Note that this implies that routers which
    are both level 1 and level\n   2 routers, and which support all four routing metrics,
    must run the\n   SPF algorithm 8 times (assuming partition repair is not implemented).\n
    \  If this system is a Level 2 Router which supports the partition\n   repair
    optional function the Decision Process algorithm for computing\n   Level 1 paths
    must be run twice for the default metric. This first\n   execution is done to
    determine which of the area's\n   manualAreaAddresses are reachable in this partition,
    and to elect a\n   Partition Designated Level 2 Router for the partition. The
    partition\n   Designated Level 2 Router will determine if the area is partitioned\n
    \  and will create virtual Level 1 links to the other Partition\n   Designated
    Level 2 Routers in the area in order to repair the Level 1\n   partition. This
    is further described in section 7.2.10 of [1].\n   The SPF algorithm specified
    here will calculate routes for both OSI\n   and IP. In particular, routes are
    calculated to all system\n   identifiers N, where N may specify an OSI End System,
    the OSI address\n   of a router, or an IP reachability entry. In computing the
    forwarding\n   database, it is an implementation specific issue whether the IP\n
    \  forwarding database is kept separately from the OSI forwarding\n   database.
    Where appropriate, this annex will refer separately to\n   entries in these two
    forwarding data bases. This is not meant to\n   preclude any specific implementation
    method.\n   OSI and IP use separate mechanisms to determine whether a packet is\n
    \  in the area (in particular, OSI makes use of area addresses, and IP\n   determines
    that a destination is not in an area by looking in the\n   level 1 forwarding
    database and determining that no entry exists for\n   that destination within
    the area). The route to the nearest level 2\n   router will result in separate
    entries in the forwarding database for\n   OSI and IP. For IP, the route to the
    nearest attached level 2 router\n   may be entered in the forwarding database
    as a default route (i.e., a\n   route with a subnet mask of all 0).\n   One approach
    would be to put the results of each Dijkstra algorithm\n   in a separate forwarding
    database. For a router which supports both\n   level 1 and level 2 routing (including
    level 2 internal and level 2\n   external routes), and which supports all four
    types of service, this\n   would result in twelve separate forwarding databases
    for IP.\n   Implementations may choose to minimize the number of forwarding\n
    \  databases by combining the information from the multiple Dijkstra\n   calculations
    into a single database per supported TOS. This is\n   discussed in section C.2
    below.\n   The SPF algorithm specified in section C.2.3 of [1] is amended to\n
    \  appear as follows:\n   Step 0: Initialize TENT and PATHS to empty. Initialize
    tentlength to\n   [internalmetric=0, externalmetric=0].\n   (tentlength is the
    pathlength of elements in TENT that we are\n   examining.)\n   1) Add <SELF,0,W>
    to PATHS, where W is a special value indicating\n      traffic to SELF is passed
    up to internal processes (rather than\n      forwarded).\n   2) Now pre-load TENT
    with the local adjacency database (Each\n      entry made to TENT must be marked
    as being either an End System\n      or a router to enable the check at the end
    of Step 2 to be made\n      correctly - Note that each local IP reachability entry
    is\n      included as an adjacency, and is marked as being an End System).\n      For
    each adjacency Adj(N) (including level 1 OSI Manual\n      Adjacencies, or level
    2 OSI enabled reachable addresses, and\n      IP reachability entries) on enabled
    circuits, to system N of\n      SELF in state \"Up\" compute:\n         d(N) =
    cost of the parent circuit of the adjacency (N),\n         obtained from metric.k
    , where k = one of {default metric,\n         delay metric, monetary metric, error
    metric}\n         Adj(N) = the adjacency number of the adjacency to N\n   3) If
    a triple <N,x,{Adj(M)}> is in TENT, then:\n         If x = d(N), then {Adj(M)}
    <--- {Adj(M)} U {Adj(N)}.\n   4) If N is a router or an OSI End System entry,
    and there are now\n      more adjacencies in {Adj(M)} than maximumPathSplits,
    then remove\n      excess adjacencies as described in Clause 7.2.7 of [1]. If
    N\n      is an IP Reachability Entry, then excess adjacencies may be\n      removed
    as desired. This will not effect the correctness of\n      routing, but may eliminate
    the determinism for IP routes (i.e.,\n      IP packets still follow optimal routes
    within an area, but\n      where multiple equally good routes exist, will not
    necessarily\n      follow precisely the route that any one particular router\n
    \     would have anticipated).\n   5) If x < d(N), do nothing.\n   6) If x > d(N),
    remove <N,x,{Adj(M)}> from TENT and add the triple\n      <N,d(N),{Adj(N)}>.\n
    \  7) If no triple <N,x,{Adj(M)}> is in TENT, then add <N,d(N),{Adj(N)}>\n      to
    TENT.\n   8) Now add systems to which the local router does not have adjacencies,\n
    \     but which are mentioned in neighboring pseudonode LSPs. The\n      adjacency
    for such systems is set to that of the designated router.\n      Note that this
    does not include IP reachability entries from\n      neighboring pseudonode LSPs.
    In particular, the pseudonode LSPs\n      do not include IP reachability entries.\n
    \  9) For all broadcast circuits in state \"On\", find the pseudonode\n      LSP
    for that circuit (specifically, the LSP with number zero and\n      with the first
    7 octets of LSPID equal to LnCircuitID for that\n      circuit, where n is 1 (for
    level 1 routing) or 2 (level 2\n      routing)). If it is present, for all the
    neighbors N reported in\n      all the LSPs of this pseudonode which do not exist
    in TENT add\n      an entry <N,d(N),{Adj(N)}> to TENT, where:\n         d(N) =
    metric.k  of the circuit.\n         Adj(N) = the adjacency number of the adjacency
    to the DR.\n   10) Go to Step 2.\n   Step 1: Examine the zeroeth link state PDU
    of P, the system just\n   placed on PATHS (i.e., the LSP with the same first 7
    octets of LSPID\n   as P, and LSP number zero).\n   1) If this LSP is present,
    and the \"Infinite Hippity Cost\" bit is\n      clear, then for each LSP of P
    (i.e., all LSPs with the same\n      first 7 octets of LSPID and P, irrespective
    of the value of\n      LSP number) compute:\n         dist(P,N) = d(P) + metric.k(P,N)\n
    \  for each neighbor N (both End System and router) of the system P. If\n   the
    \"Infinite Hippity Cost\" bit is set, only consider the End System\n   neighbors
    of the system P. Note that the End Systems neighbors of the\n   system P includes

  - "C.2.2 Reduction of IP Forwarding Databases\n   The multiple forwarding databases
    used in the basic forwarding method\n   in section C.2.1 can be reduced, by combining
    the multiple databases\n   into one database for each supported TOS.\n   For reduction
    of IP forwarding databases, it is assumed that for any\n   two overlapping address
    entries, either the entries are identical, or\n   one range contains the other.
    In other words, for any two [IP\n   address, subnet mask] entries A and B, if
    there is at least one IP\n   address which matches both entries, then either:
    (i) the two entries\n   are identical; or (ii) entry A contains entry B (i.e.,
    any IP address\n   which matches entry B also matches entry A); or (iii) entry
    B\n   contains entry A (any IP address which matches entry A also matches\n   entry
    B).\n   Non-contiguous subnet masks can be configured to violate this\n   assumption.
    For example, consider the two entries:\n   - A=[address=\"01010101 00000101 00000000
    00000000\",\n     mask=\"11111111 00001111 00000000 00000000\"]\n   - B=[address=\"01010101
    01010000 00000000 00000000\",\n     mask=\"11111111 11110000 00000000 00000000\"]\n
    \  In this case neither entry contains the other. Specifically;\n   - there are
    IP addresses which match both A and B (e.g.,\n     \"01010101 01010101 xxxxxxxx
    xxxxxxxx\"),\n   - there are IP addresses which match A but not B (e.g.,\n     \"01010101
    11110101 xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx\")\n   - there are IP addresses which match B but not
    A (e.g.,\n     \"01010101 01011111 xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx\").\n   The reduction of
    the multiple forwarding databases for each TOS to a\n   single database for each
    TOS is based on the use of \"best match\"\n   routing, combined with reduction
    of the entries placed in the\n   forwarding database in order to eliminate entries
    which are not to be\n   selected (based on the order of preference of routes specified
    in\n   section 3.10). The specific algorithm for creation of the IP\n   forwarding
    database can be described as follows:\n   1) Make use of the the Dijkstra algorithm
    described in section C.1 to\n      create separate forwarding databases for each
    supported TOS for\n      level 1 routes, level 2 internal routes, and level 2
    external\n      routes. (Note that each entry in the forwarding database will\n
    \     specify an [IP address, subnet mask] combination, as well as the\n      next
    hop router for IP packets which match that entry).\n   2) For each level 1 route
    entry which has been placed in the level 1\n      IP forwarding database for a
    specific TOS, copy that entry into\n      the overall IP forwarding database for
    that TOS.\n   3) For each route entry X which has been placed in the level 2 internal\n
    \     IP forwarding database for a specific TOS, search for overlapping\n      entries
    in the level 1 IP forwarding database for the specific TOS,\n      and also for
    the default TOS:\n      a) If there is any overlapping entry Y in the level 1
    forwarding\n         database (for the specfic TOS, or for the default TOS) such\n
    \        that either (i) Y contains X; or (ii) Y is identically specific\n         to
    X; then ignore entry X.\n      b) Otherwise, copy entry X into the overall IP
    forwarding database\n         for the specific TOS.\n   4) For each route entry
    X which has been placed in the level 2\n      external IP forwarding database
    for a specific TOS, search for\n      overlapping entries in the level 1 IP forwarding
    database for\n      the specific TOS, and for the default TOS, and the level 2\n
    \     internal IP forwarding database for the specific TOS, and for\n      the
    default TOS.\n      a) If there is an overlapping entry Y such that either (i)
    Y\n         contains X; or (ii) Y is identically specific to X; then\n         ignore
    entry X.\n      b) Otherwise, copy entry X into the overall IP forwarding database\n
    \        for the specific TOS.\n   This method will result in one forwarding database
    for each supported\n   TOS. The forwarding of packets can then be simplified to
    be as follows:\n   1) For IP packets which map to the default TOS metric (or to
    an\n      unsupported TOS metric), search the default TOS forwarding\n      database
    and select the entry which has the most specific match.\n      Forward the packet
    accordingly.\n   2) For packets which map to a specific (non-default) TOS metric,\n
    \     search the specific TOS forwarding database and select the entry\n      j
    which has the most specific match. Also search the default TOS\n      forwarding
    database and select the entry k which has the most\n      specific match. Forward
    the packet as follows:\n      a) If k is more specific than j, forward according
    to entry k\n      b) If j and k are equally specific, forward according to entry
    j\n      c) If j is more specific than k, forward according to entry j\n                                  Annex

    does not provide useful\n   protection against intentional misbehavior. In particular,
    since the\n   password is transmitted in the clear without encryption, it is easy\n
    \  for a hostile system to intercept the passwords, and to transmit\n   authenticated

    shall be configured on a per-link, per-area, and per-\n   domain basis. Specifically,
    when this form of authentication is used:\n   - IS-IS Hello and 9542 IS Hello
    packets shall contain the\n     per-link password\n   - Level 1 Link State Packets
    shall contain the per-area password\n   - Level 2 Link State Packets shall contain

    (i)\n   \"Transmit Password\", whose value is a single password, and (ii)\n   \"Receive
    Passwords\", whose value is a set of passwords. The transmit\n   password value
    is always transmitted. However, any password contained\n   in the receive password
    set will be accepted on receipt. This method\n   allows the graceful changing
    of passwords without temporary loss of\n   connectivity.\n   For example, consider
    the case that an area has the configured area\n   password \"OLDAREAPASSWORD\".
    In this case, the per-area transmit\n   password value is set to OLDAREAPASSWORD,
    and the per-area receive\n   password value is set to {OLDAREAPASSWORD}. Suppose
    that it is\n   desired to change the per-area password to \"NEWERPASSWORD\".  The\n
    \  first step would be to manually configure all of the routers in the\n   area
    to set the per-area receive password value to {OLDAREAPASSWORD,\n   NEWERPASSWORD}.
    When this step is complete, then all routers in the\n   area will still be using
    the old password OLDAREAPASSWORD in their\n   level 1 LSPs and SNPs. However,
    they will also accept the alternate\n   password NEWERPASSWORD. The second step
    would be to configure the\n   routers in the area to set the per-area transmit
    password to\n   NEWERPASSWORD. When the second step is complete, then all routers\n
    \  will be using the new value of the per-area password, but will accept\n   the
    old value as well. Finally, the third step is to change all\n   routers in the
    area to have the per-area receive password set to\n   {NEWERPASSWORD}.\n   By
    configuring transmit and receive values for the passwords in this\n   manner,
    it is possible to maintain continuous correct operation. For\n   example, in the
    middle of the second step in the above example, some\n   of the routers in the
    area will be transmitting level 1 LSPs and SNPs\n   using the old password OLDAREAPASSWORD,
    and some will be transmitting\n   level 1 LSPs and SNPs using the new password
    NEWERPASSWORD. However,\n   during the second step of the transition all routers
    in the area will\n   accept level 1 LSPs and SNPs using either password.\n                                  Annex

    \  Here suppose that X and Y are running the Integrated IS-IS protocol,\n   and
    are both level 1 routers in the same area. Thus X and Y send IS-\n   IS Hello
    packets on the LAN. These Hello packets are received and\n   forwarded by the
    brouter (using normal bridge functions). Similarly,\n   X and Y receive each other's
    IS-IS LSP packets. In this way, it\n   appears to the Brouter that X and Y are
    exchanging OSI packets, and\n   so they are forwarded using normal bridge functions.
    It appears to X\n   and Y as if they are on the same LAN, and so they learn each
    others\n   48-bit Ethernet addresses and exchange routing information.\n   Now,
    suppose that X receives an IP packet, which it needs to forward\n   via Y. Since
    X thinks that it and Y are on the same Ethernet, it just\n   forwards the IP packet
    directly, using normal Ethernet encapsulation\n   and using the 48-bit Ethernet
    address of Y as the destination address\n   in the Ethernet header. Brouter B,
    when thinking as a bridge says:\n   \"this is an IP packet, I don't forward this
    as a bridge\". Brouter B,\n   when thinking like an IP router says: \"this is
    an IP packet, I know\n   how to forward IP packets. However, this is sent to an
    Ethernet\n   address which is not me, thus I will ignore it\". The result is that\n
    \  the IP packet does not get forwarded.\n   This problem relates directly to
    the fact that X and Y are exchanging\n   OSI packets to determine the connectivity
    of the path between them,\n   but then are trying to send IP packets over the
    path. Also, there is\n   a device between X and Y on the path which treats OSI
    and IP packets\n   differently.\n   Also note that this problem can also occur
    in more complex\n   topologies, whenever a brouter is treating OSI and IP packets
    in a\n   fundamentally different manner.\n"

    IP packets sent to my own Ethernet 48-bit address(es), act as\n     an IP router
    (this is also the same as before).\n   - For IP packets sent to a single station
    48-bit address which is not\n     one of my addresses, act at a bridge (THIS IS
    NEW).\n   With this change, the IP packet transmitted from X to Y is forwarded\n
    \  by the brouter, acting as a bridge. This allows the Brouter and the\n   multiprotocol
    routers to interoperate properly.\n"

  - "E.2.2 Dual Router / Brouter\n   An alternate solution would be for the Brouter
    to route both OSI and\n   IP equally. If the Brouter used the integrated IS-IS
    for this\n   purpose, then it could be part of the same routing domain and\n   interoperate
    like any other dual router (except for the ability to\n   bridge other protocol
    suites).  If it used other protocols for\n   routing OSI and IP, then it would
    need to be part of another routing\n   domain, and could interoperate with integrated
    IS-IS routers like any\n   other external router.\n"
