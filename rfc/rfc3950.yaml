    in detail by\n   RFC 3949, \"File Format for Internet Fax\" [TIFF-FX].\n   While
    a brief scope and feature description is provided in this\n   section as background
    information, the reader is directed to the\n   original TIFF-FX specification
    (File Format for Internet Fax) to\n   obtain complete feature and technical details.\n"

    - "2.1.  TIFF-FX Scope\n   This document defines a TIFF-based file format specification
      for\n   enabling standardized messaging-based fax over the Internet.  It\n   specifies
      the TIFF fields and field values required for compatibility\n   with the existing
      ITU-T Recommendations for Group 3 black-and-white,\n   grayscale and color facsimile.
      \ TIFF has historically been used for\n   handling fax image files in applications
      such as store-and-forward\n   messaging.  Implementations that support this
      file format\n   specification for import/export may elect to support it as a
      native\n   format.  This document recommends a TIFF file structure that is\n
      \  compatible with low-memory and page-level streaming implementations.\n   Unless
      otherwise noted, the current TIFF specification [TIFF] and\n   selected TIFF
      Technical Notes [TTN1, TTN2] are the primary references\n   for describing TIFF
      and defining TIFF fields.  This document is the\n   primary reference for defining
      TIFF field values for fax\n   applications.\n"

    - "2.2.  TIFF-FX Features\n   Some of the features of TIFF-FX are:\n   -  TIFF-FX
      is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-\n      color, full-color
      and mixed content image data.\n   -  TIFF-FX includes a number of compression
      schemes that allow\n      developers to choose the best space or time tradeoff
      for their\n      applications.\n   -  TIFF-FX is designed to be extensible and
      to evolve gracefully as\n      new needs arise.\n"

  - "3.  MIME Definition\n   This document defines the image/tiff-fx MIME sub-type
    to refer to\n   TIFF-FX Profiles J, C, L and M encoded image data and any future\n
    \  TIFF-FX extensions, or a subset.  The image/tiff-fx content type MAY\n   be
    used when black-and-white image data is encoded using TIFF-FX\n   Profiles S or
    F, or a subset, however, the image/tiff content type\n   SHOULD be used.\n"

  - "4.  IANA Registration\n   To: ietf-types@iana.org\n   Subject: Registration of
    Standard MIME media type image/tiff-fx\n   MIME media type name: image\n   MIME
    subtype name: tiff-fx\n   Required parameters: none\n   Optional parameters: none\n
    \  Encoding Considerations:\n      This media type consists of binary data.  The
    base64 encoding\n      should be used on transports that cannot accommodate binary
    data\n      directly.\n   Security considerations:\n      TIFF-FX utilizes a structure
    which can store image data and\n      attributes of this image data.  The fields
    defined in the TIFF-FX\n      specification are of a descriptive nature and provide
    information\n      that is useful to facilitate viewing and rendering of images
    by a\n      recipient.  As such, the fields currently defined in the TIFF-FX\n
    \     specification do not in themselves create additional security\n      risks,
    since the fields are not used to induce any particular\n      behavior by the
    recipient application.\n      TIFF-FX has an extensible structure, so that it
    is theoretically\n      possible that fields could be defined in the future which
    could be\n      used to induce particular actions on the part of the recipient,\n
    \     thus presenting additional security risks, but this type of\n      capability
    is not supported in the referenced TIFF-FX\n      specification.  Indeed, the
    definition of fields which would\n      include such processing instructions is
    inconsistent with the\n      goals and spirit of the TIFF-FX specification.\n
    \     The MIME type and file extension defined by this document MUST NOT\n      be
    used to blindly select a processing program.  It is up to the\n      implementation
    to determine the application (if necessary) and\n      render the image to the
    user.\n   Interoperability considerations:\n      The ability of implementations
    to handle all the defined\n      applications (or profiles within applications)
    of TIFF-FX may not\n      be ubiquitous.  As a result, implementations may decode
    and\n      attempt to display the encoded TIFF-FX image data only to\n      determine
    that the image cannot be rendered.\n   Published specification:\n      TIFF-FX
    (Tag Image File Format Fax eXtended) is defined in:\n      RFC 3949, \"File Format
    for Internet Fax\", February 2005, Buckley,\n      R., Venable, D., McIntyre,
    L., Parsons, G., and J. Rafferty.\n   Applications which use this media type:\n

    number(s):\n           II (little-endian):  49 49 2A 00 hex\n           MM (big-endian):
