This document registers a set of IANA Diameter Command Codes to be used in new vendor specific Diameter applications defined for the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Evolved Packet System (EPS).
These new Diameter applications are defined for Mobile Management Entity (MME)  and Serving GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)
related interfaces in in the architecture for the Evolved 3GPP Packet Switched Domain, which is also known as the Evolved Packet System (EPS).
The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is defining the Evolved 3GPP Packet Switched Domain also known as the Evolved Packet System (EPS).
As part of this architecture, the interfaces based on the Diameter protocol [RFC3588] require the definition of two new Diameter applications.
As defined in [TS29.272], the 3GPP S6a/S6d application (vendor  specific application id: 16777251) enables the transfer of subscriber related data between the Mobile Management Entity (MME) and the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) on the S6a interface and between the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) and the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) on the S6d interface.
Also defined in [TS29.272], the 3GPP S13/S13' application (vendor  specific application id: 16777252) enables the Mobile Equipment Identity check procedure between the Mobile Management Entity (MME) and the Equipment Identity Register (EIR) on the S13 interface and between the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) and the Equipment Identity Register (EIR) on the S13' interface.
Both Diameter applications are defined under the 3GPP vendor id "10415".
This document defines the assigned values of the command codes used in these applications.
The base Diameter specification (Section 1.3 of [RFC3588]) defines most of the terminology used in this document.
Additionally, the terms and acronyms defined in [TS29.272] are used in this document.
The 3GPP S6a/S6d application described in Section 5 of [TS29.272] requires the allocation of command code values for the following command pairs:  3GPP
Cancel Location Request/Answer (CLR/CLA)  3GPP Authentication Information Request/ Answer (AIR/AIA)
3GPP Insert Subscriber Data Request/Answer (IDR/IDA)
Delete Subscriber Data Request/Answer (DSR/DSA)
Purge UE Request/Answer (PUR/PUA)  3GPP
The 3GPP S13/S13 application described in Section 6 of [TS29.272] requires the allocation of a command code value for the following command pair:  3GPP
ME Identity Check Request/Answer (ECR/ECA)
This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the Diameter protocol, in accordance with BCP 26 [RFC5226].
This document defines values in the namespace that has been defined in the Diameter base specification [RFC3588].
(that document's IANA Considerations) details the assignment criteria.
3GPP Authentication Information Answer  AIA
This document describes command codes used in applications that build on top of the Diameter base protocol and
the same security considerations described in [RFC3588] are applicable to this document.
No further extensions are required beyond the security mechanisms offered by [RFC3588].
