    to duplicate the packets and send them in\n   separate redundant streams.  This

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] is widely
    used today\n   for delivering IPTV traffic and other real-time multimedia sessions.\n
    \  Many of these applications support very large numbers of receivers\n   and
    rely on intra-domain UDP/IP multicast for efficient distribution\n   of traffic
    within the network.\n   While this combination has proved successful, there does
    exist a\n   weakness.  As [RFC2354] noted, packet loss is not avoidable, even
    in\n   a carefully managed network.  This loss might be due to congestion;\n   it
    might also be a result of an unplanned outage caused by a flapping\n   link, a
    link or interface failure, a software bug, or a maintenance\n   person accidentally
    cutting the wrong fiber.  Since UDP/IP flows do\n   not provide any means for
    detecting loss and retransmitting packets,\n   it is left up to the RTP layer
    and the applications to detect, and\n   recover from, packet loss.\n   One technique
    to recover from packet loss without incurring unbounded\n   delay for all the
    receivers is to duplicate the packets and send them\n   in separate redundant
    streams.  Variations on this idea have been\n   implemented and deployed today
    [IC2011].  [RTP-DUP] explains how\n   duplication can be achieved for RTP streams
    without breaking the RTP\n   and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) functionality.  In
    this document, we\n   describe the semantics needed in the Session Description
    Protocol\n   (SDP) [RFC4566] to support this technique.\n"

    - "3.1.  \"DUP\" Grouping Semantics\n   Each \"a=group\" line is used to indicate
      an association relationship\n   between the redundant streams.  The streams
      included in one \"a=group\"\n   line are called a \"Duplication Group\".\n   Using
      the SDP Grouping Framework in [RFC5888], this document defines\n   \"DUP\" as
      the grouping semantics for redundant streams.\n   The \"a=group:DUP\" semantics
      MUST be used to group the redundant\n   streams, except when the streams are
      specified in the same media\n   description, i.e., in the same \"m\" line (see
      Section 3.2).  In an\n   \"a=group:DUP\" line, the order of the listed redundant
      streams does\n   not strictly indicate the order of transmission, although it
      is\n   RECOMMENDED that the stream listed first be sent first, with the\n   other
      stream(s) being the (time-delayed) duplicate(s).\n"
    title: 3.1.  "DUP" Grouping Semantics
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Duplication Grouping for SSRC-Multiplexed RTP Streams\n   [RFC5576] defines
      an SDP media-level attribute, called \"ssrc-group\",\n   for grouping the RTP
      streams that are SSRC multiplexed and carried in\n   the same RTP session.  The
      grouping is based on the SSRC identifiers.\n   Since SSRC-multiplexed RTP streams
      are defined in the same \"m\" line,\n   the \"group\" attribute cannot be used.\n
      \  This section explains how duplication is used with SSRC-multiplexed\n   streams
      using the \"ssrc-group\" attribute [RFC5576].\n   The semantics of \"DUP\" for
      the \"ssrc-group\" attribute are the same as\n   the one defined for the \"group\"
      attribute, except that the SSRC\n   identifiers are used to designate the duplication
      grouping\n   associations: a=ssrc-group:DUP *(SP ssrc-id) [RFC5576].  As above,\n
      \  while in an \"a=ssrc-group:DUP\" line, the order of the listed\n   redundant
      streams does not necessarily indicate the order of\n   transmission, but it
      is RECOMMENDED that the stream listed first be\n   sent first, with the other
      stream(s) being the (time-delayed)\n   duplicate(s).\n"

    - "3.3.  SDP Offer/Answer Model Considerations\n   When offering duplication grouping
      using SDP in an offer/answer model\n   [RFC3264], the following considerations
      apply.\n   A node that is receiving an offer from a sender may or may not\n
      \  understand line grouping.  It is also possible that the node\n   understands
      line grouping but does not understand the \"DUP\"\n   semantics.  From the viewpoint
      of the sender of the offer, these\n   cases are indistinguishable.\n   When
      a node is offered a session with the \"DUP\" grouping semantics\n   but it does
      not support line grouping or the duplication grouping\n   semantics, as per
      [RFC5888], the node responds to the offer either\n   (1) with an answer that
      omits the grouping attribute or (2) with a\n   refusal to the request (e.g.,
      \"488 Not Acceptable Here\" or \"606 Not\n   Acceptable in SIP\").\n   In the
      first case, the original sender of the offer must send a new\n   offer without
      any duplication grouping.  In the second case, if the\n   sender of the offer
      still wishes to establish the session, it should\n   retry the request with
      an offer without the duplication grouping.\n   This behavior is specified in
      [RFC5888].\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   In general, the security considerations of [RFC4566]
    apply to this\n   document as well.\n   There is a weak threat for the receiver
    that the duplication grouping\n   can be modified to indicate relationships that
    do not exist.  Such\n   attacks might result in failure of the duplication mechanisms
    and/or\n   mishandling of the media streams by the receivers.\n   In order to
    avoid attacks of this sort, the SDP description needs to\n   be integrity protected
    and provided with source authentication.  This\n   can, for example, be achieved
    on an end-to-end basis using S/MIME\n   [RFC5652] [RFC5751] when the SDP is used
    in a signaling packet using\n   MIME types (application/sdp).  Alternatively,
    HTTPS [RFC2818] or the\n   authentication method in the Session Announcement Protocol
    (SAP)\n   [RFC2974] could be used as well.  As for the confidentiality, if it\n
    \  is desired, it can be useful to use a secure, encrypted transport\n   method
    to carry the SDP description.\n"
