- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Some real-time communication endpoints support the combined\
    \ use of\n   the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] and the Extensible\n\
    \   Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [RFC6120].  To improve\n   interoperability\
    \ among such \"CUSAX\" endpoints [CUSAX], it can be\n   helpful to advertise each\
    \ endpoint's SIP address over XMPP and each\n   endpoint's XMPP address over SIP,\
    \ thus providing hints about the\n   communication capabilities of the endpoints.\
    \  The former feature is\n   enabled by an XMPP extension protocol called Reachability\
    \ Addresses\n   [XEP-0152].  As to the latter feature, discussion in the SIP\n\
    \   community led to the conclusion that it would be best to use the\n   Call-Info\
    \ header field [RFC3261] with a value of \"impp\" (\"instant\n   messaging and\
    \ presence protocol\") for the \"purpose\" header field\n   parameter.  An example\
    \ follows.\n   Call-Info: <xmpp:juliet@example.com> ;purpose=impp\n   Although\
    \ CUSAX endpoints constitute the primary use case for the\n   \"impp\" purpose,\
    \ a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] for an\n   instant messaging and\
    \ presence protocol other than XMPP could be\n   included in the Call-Info header\
    \ field.\n"
- title: 2.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  Security Considerations\n   Advertising an endpoint's XMPP address over SIP\
    \ could inform\n   malicious entities about an alternative attack vector.  Because\
    \ the\n   \"purpose\" header field parameter could be spoofed, the receiving\n\
    \   endpoint ought to check the value against an authoritative source\n   such\
    \ as a user directory.  Clients can integrity protect and encrypt\n   this header\
    \ field using end-to-end mechanisms such as S/MIME or hop-\n   by-hop mechanisms\
    \ such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).\n   This specification provides a new\
    \ way to correlate otherwise possibly\n   unconnected identifiers.  Because such\
    \ correlations can be privacy\n   sensitive, user agents ought to provide a means\
    \ for users to control\n   whether or not these values are sent.\n"
- title: 3.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   This document defines and registers a new predefined\
    \ value \"impp\" for\n   the \"purpose\" header field parameter of the Call-Info\
    \ header field.\n   The IANA has completed this action by adding this RFC as a\
    \ reference\n   to the line for the header field \"Call-Info\" and parameter name\n\
    \   \"purpose\" in the \"Header Field Parameters and Parameter Values\"\n   section\
    \ of the \"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Parameters\"\n   registry as follows:\n\
    \     Header Field: Call-Info\n     Parameter Name: purpose\n     Predefined Values:\
    \ Yes\n     Reference: [RFC3261][RFC5367][RFC6910][RFC6993]\n"
