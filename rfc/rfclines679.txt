February, 1975, Survey of New Protocol TELNET Servers
It has been two and a half months since our last survey, and it has been depressing to note that "progress" toward an all new protocol network has been even slower than previously.
Changes since the last list (with host numbers in octal): SRI ARC (2) and OFFICE 1 (53) have added logger sockets 27, but with Old Protocol servers (are these forerunners of New Protocol servers?); SDC CC (110) has been removed from the list until it starts operating on the network LL 67 (12) now has a New Protocol server on socket 1; CASE 10 (15) has departed from the network; BBN TENEX is now host 361 (formerly 105); ANL (ARGONNE, 67) has come on the net with Old  and New Protocol servers on sockets 1 and 27, respectively.
The following is the latest version  of the summary and tabulation of server host Telnet servers.
All data in this report were gathered via a surveying program run at various times, plus a few manual checks to fill out the data.
What is reported here is the way the various servers work as seen by the new Protocol User Telnet at BBNA, as of 20 Feb. 1975.
These are the sites whose operation is 100% correct according to all protocols and conventions, as I understand them.
(3) We realize that some of the servers that appear here as New  Protocol servers on socket 1 are actually servers which attempt to communicate with both Old  and New Protocol User TELNETs according to what control sequences are received.
Tabulation of server status for all server sites:
No server at this socket ?
Status not ascertained   unable to connect to host I
# Option # implemented outgoing from user
(# is option number in new Protocol.
All options implemented by anyone are: 0    Transmit Binary 1    Echo 3
Suppress Go Ahead 6    Timing Mark )
These servers return improper responses to some TELNET option requests.
