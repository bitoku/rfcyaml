  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a new OSPF Router Information (RI) TLV that\n\
    \   allows OSPF routers to flood their hostname-to-Router-ID mapping\n   information\
    \ across an OSPF network to provide a simple and dynamic\n   mechanism for routers\
    \ running OSPF to learn about symbolic hostnames,\n   just like for routers running\
    \ IS-IS.  This mechanism is applicable to\n   both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   OSPF uses a 32-bit Router ID to uniquely represent and identify\
    \ a\n   node in the network.  For management and operational reasons, network\n\
    \   operators need to check the status of OSPF adjacencies, entries in\n   the\
    \ routing table, and the content of the OSPF link state database.\n   When looking\
    \ at diagnostic information, numerical representations of\n   Router IDs (e.g.,\
    \ dotted-decimal or hexadecimal representations) are\n   less clear to humans\
    \ than symbolic names.\n   One way to overcome this problem is to define a hostname-to-Router-ID\n\
    \   mapping table on a router.  This mapping can be used bidirectionally\n   (e.g.,\
    \ to find symbolic names for Router IDs and to find Router IDs\n   for symbolic\
    \ names) or unidirectionally (e.g., to find symbolic\n   hostnames for Router\
    \ IDs).  Thus, every router has to maintain a\n   table with mappings between\
    \ router names and Router IDs.\n   These tables need to contain all names and\
    \ Router IDs of all routers\n   in the network.  If these mapping tables are built\
    \ by static\n   definitions, it can currently become a manual and tedious process\
    \ in\n   operational networks; modifying these static mapping entries when\n \
    \  additions, deletions, or changes occur becomes a non-scalable process\n   very\
    \ prone to error.\n   This document analyzes possible solutions to this problem\
    \ (see\n   Section 2) and provides a way to populate tables by defining a new\n\
    \   OSPF Router Information TLV for OSPF, the Dynamic Hostname TLV (see\n   Section\
    \ 3).  This mechanism is applicable to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.\n"

- title: 2.  Possible Solutions
  contents:
  - "2.  Possible Solutions\n   There are various approaches to providing a name-to-Router-ID\
    \ mapping\n   service.\n   One way to build this table of mappings is by static\
    \ definitions.\n   The problem with static definitions is that the network administrator\n\
    \   needs to keep updating the mapping entries manually as the network\n   changes;\
    \ this approach does not scale as the network grows, since\n   there needs to\
    \ be an entry in the mapping table for each and every\n   router in the network,\
    \ on every router in the network.  Thus, this\n   approach greatly suffers from\
    \ maintainability and scalability\n   considerations.\n   Another approach is\
    \ having a centralized location where the name-to-\n   Router-ID mapping can be\
    \ kept.  The DNS could be used for this.  A\n   disadvantage with this centralized\
    \ solution is that it is a single\n   point of failure; and although enhanced\
    \ availability of the central\n   mapping service can be designed, it may not\
    \ be able to resolve the\n   hostname in the event of reachability or network\
    \ problems, which can\n   be particularly problematic in times of problem resolution.\
    \  Also,\n   the response time can be an issue with the centralized solution,\n\
    \   which can be equally problematic.  If the DNS is used as the\n   centralized\
    \ mapping table, a network operator may desire a different\n   name mapping than\
    \ the existing mapping in the DNS, or new routers may\n   not yet be in the DNS.\n\
    \   Additionally, for OSPFv3 in native IPv6 deployments, the 32-bit\n   Router\
    \ ID value will not map to IPv4-addressed entities in the\n   network, nor will\
    \ it be DNS resolvable (see Section 4).\n   The third solution that we have defined\
    \ in this document is to make\n   use of the protocol itself to carry the name-to-Router-ID\
    \ mapping in\n   a TLV.  Routers that understand this TLV can use it to create\
    \ the\n   symbolic name-to-Router-ID mapping, and routers that don't understand\n\
    \   it can simply ignore it.  This specification provides these semantics\n  \
    \ and mapping mechanisms for OSPFv2 and OSPFv3, leveraging the OSPF\n   Router\
    \ Information (RI) Link State Advertisement (LSA) ([RFC4970]).\n"
- title: 3.  Implementation
  contents:
  - "3.  Implementation\n   This extension makes use of the Router Information (RI)\
    \ Opaque LSA,\n   defined in [RFC4970], for both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3, by defining\
    \ a new\n   OSPF Router Information (RI) TLV: the Dynamic Hostname TLV.\n   The\
    \ Dynamic Hostname TLV (see Section 3.1) is OPTIONAL.  Upon receipt\n   of the\
    \ TLV, a router may decide to ignore this TLV or to install the\n   symbolic name\
    \ and Router ID in its hostname mapping table.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Dynamic Hostname TLV
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Dynamic Hostname TLV\n   The format of the Dynamic Hostname TLV is as follows:\n\

    \ padding.\n   Value    Hostname, a string of 1 to 255 octets, padded with zeroes\
    \ to\n            4-octet alignment, encoded in the US-ASCII charset.\n   Routers\
    \ that do not recognize the Dynamic Hostname TLV Type ignore\n   the TLV (see\
    \ [RFC4970]).\n   The Value field identifies the symbolic hostname of the router\n\
    \   originating the LSA.  This symbolic name can be the Fully Qualified\n   Domain\
    \ Name (FQDN) for the Router ID, it can be a subset of the FQDN,\n   or it can\
    \ be any string that operators want to use for the router.\n   The use of FQDN\
    \ or a subset of it is strongly recommended since it\n   can be beneficial to\
    \ correlate the OSPF dynamic hostname and the DNS\n   hostname.  The format of\
    \ the DNS hostname is described in [RFC1035]\n   and [RFC2181].  If there is no\
    \ DNS hostname for the Router ID, if the\n   Router ID does not map to an IPv4-addressed\
    \ entity (e.g., see\n   Section 4), or if an alternate OSPF dynamic hostname naming\n\
    \   convention is desired, any string with significance in the OSPF\n   routing\
    \ domain can be used.  The string is not null-terminated.  The\n   Router ID of\
    \ this router is derived from the LSA header, in the\n   Advertising Router field\
    \ of the Router Information (RI) Opaque LSA.\n   The Value field is encoded in\
    \ 7-bit ASCII.  If a user-interface for\n   configuring or displaying this field\
    \ permits Unicode characters, that\n   user-interface is responsible for applying\
    \ the ToASCII and/or\n   ToUnicode algorithm as described in [RFC3490] to achieve\
    \ the correct\n   format for transmission or display.\n   The Dynamic Hostname\
    \ TLV is applicable to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Flooding Scope
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Flooding Scope\n   The Dynamic Hostname TLV MAY be advertised within\
    \ an area-local or\n   autonomous system (AS)-scope Router Information (RI) LSA.\
    \  But the\n   Dynamic Hostname TLV SHOULD NOT be advertised into an area in more\n\
    \   than one RI LSA, irrespective of the scope of the LSA.\n   In other words,\
    \ if a router originates a Dynamic Hostname TLV with an\n   IGP domain (AS) flooding\
    \ scope, it SHOULD NOT send area-scoped\n   Dynamic Hostname TLVs except into\
    \ any attached Not-So-Stubby Area\n   (NSSA) area(s).  Similarly, if a router\
    \ originates an area-scoped\n   Dynamic Hostname TLV (other than NSSA area scoped),\
    \ it SHOULD NOT\n   send an AS-scoped Dynamic Hostname TLV.  When the Dynamic\
    \ Hostname\n   TLV is advertised in more than one LSA (e.g., multiple area-scoped\n\
    \   LSAs, or AS-scoped LSAs plus NSSA area-scope LSA(s)), the hostname\n   SHOULD\
    \ be the same.\n   If a router is advertising any AS-scope LSA (other than Dynamic\n\
    \   Hostname TLV RI LSA), such router SHOULD advertise Dynamic Hostname\n   TLV\
    \ RI LSA in AS scope.  Otherwise, it SHOULD advertise Dynamic\n   Hostname TLV\
    \ RI LSA in area scope.  For example, an AS boundary\n   router (ASBR) SHOULD\
    \ send an AS-scope Dynamic Hostname TLV, whereas\n   area boundary router (ABRs)\
    \ and internal routers SHOULD send an area-\n   scope Dynamic Hostname TLV.\n\
    \   The flooding scope is controlled by the Opaque LSA type in OSPFv2 and\n  \
    \ by the S1 and S2 bits in OSPFv3.  For area scope, the Dynamic\n   Hostname TLV\
    \ MUST be carried within an OSPFv2 Type 10 RI LSA or an\n   OSPFv3 RI LSA with\
    \ the S1 bit set and the S2 bit clear.  If the\n   flooding scope is the entire\
    \ routing domain (AS scope), the Dynamic\n   Hostname TLV MUST be carried within\
    \ an OSPFv2 Type 11 RI LSA or\n   OSPFv3 RI LSA with the S1 bit clear and the\
    \ S2 bit set.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  Multiple OSPF Instances
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Multiple OSPF Instances\n   When an OSPF Router Information (RI) LSA,\
    \ including the Dynamic\n   Hostname TLV, is advertised in multiple OSPF instances,\
    \ the hostname\n   SHOULD either be preserved or include a common base element.\
    \  It may\n   be useful for debugging or other purposes to assign separate\n \
    \  instances different hostnames with a consistent set of suffixes or\n   prefixes\
    \ that can be associated with a specific instance -- in\n   particular, when an\
    \ instance is used for a discrete address family or\n   non-routing information.\n"
- title: 4.  IPv6 Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IPv6 Considerations\n   Both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 employ Router IDs with a common\
    \ size of 32\n   bits.  In IPv4, the Router ID values were typically derived\n\
    \   automatically from an IPv4 address either configured on a loopback or\n  \
    \ physical interface defined on the local system or explicitly defined\n   within\
    \ the OSPF process configuration.  With broader deployment of\n   IPv6, it's quite\
    \ likely that OSPF networks will exist that have no\n   native IPv4-addressed\
    \ interfaces.  As a result, a 32-bit OSPF Router\n   ID will need to be either\
    \ explicitly specified or derived in some\n   automatic manner that avoids collisions\
    \ with other OSPF routers\n   within the local routing domain.\n   Because this\
    \ 32-bit value will not map to IPv4-addressed entities in\n   the network, nor\
    \ will it be DNS resolvable, it is considered\n   extremely desirable from an\
    \ operational perspective that some\n   mechanism exist to map OSPF Router IDs\
    \ to more easily interpreted\n   values -- ideally, human-readable strings.  This\
    \ specification\n   enables a mapping functionality that eases operational burdens\
    \ that\n   may otherwise be introduced with native deployment of IPv6.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Since the hostname-to-Router-ID mapping relies\
    \ on information\n   provided by the routers themselves, a misconfigured or compromised\n\
    \   router can inject false mapping information, including a duplicate\n   hostname\
    \ for different Router IDs.  Thus, this information needs to\n   be treated with\
    \ suspicion when, for example, doing diagnostics about\n   a suspected security\
    \ incident.\n   There is potential confusion from name collisions if two routers\
    \ use\n   and advertise the same dynamic hostname.  Name conflicts are not\n \
    \  crucial, and therefore there is no generic conflict detection or\n   resolution\
    \ mechanism in the protocol.  However, a router that detects\n   that a received\
    \ hostname is the same as the local one can issue a\n   notification or a management\
    \ alert.\n   The use of the FQDN as OSPF dynamic hostname potentially exposes\n\
    \   geographic or other commercial information that can be deduced from\n   the\
    \ hostname when sent in the clear.  OSPFv3 supports confidentiality\n   via transport\
    \ mode IPsec (see [RFC4552]).  OSPFv2 could be operated\n   over IPsec tunnels\
    \ if confidentiality is required.\n   This document raises no other new security\
    \ issues for OSPF.  Security\n   considerations for the base OSPF protocol are\
    \ covered in [RFC2328]\n   and [RFC5340].  The use of authentication for the OSPF\
    \ routing\n   protocols is encouraged.\n"
