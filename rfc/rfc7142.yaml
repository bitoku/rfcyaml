  - "1.  Introduction\n   IS-IS is the \"OSI Intermediate system to Intermediate system\
    \ intra-\n   domain routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction\n\
    \   with the protocol for providing the connectionless-mode Network\n   Service\
    \ (ISO 8473)\", otherwise known as ISO/IEC 10589.  It has been\n   extended for\
    \ use with IP by RFC 1195 [RFC1195] and subsequently\n   enhanced by many other\
    \ RFCs.\n   RFC 1142 [RFC1142] was a republication of ISO DP 10589 originally\n\
    \   provided as a service to the Internet community.  However, ISO DP\n   10589\
    \ was an ISO \"Draft Proposal\", which differed in a considerable\n   number of\
    \ significant respects from the final standardized version\n   published as ISO/IEC\
    \ 10589 [ISO10589-First-Edition], and subsequently\n   revised as ISO/IEC 10589\
    \ Second Edition [ISO10589-Second-Edition].\n   It has been an ongoing source\
    \ of confusion when RFC 1142 has been\n   unwittingly quoted or referenced in\
    \ place of ISO/IEC 10589 itself.\n   All references to IS-IS should be to the\
    \ latest edition of the IS-IS\n   standard (currently ISO/IEC 10589:2002, Second\
    \ Edition), and RFC 1142\n   is only of historic interest.\n   This memo explains\
    \ why RFC 1142, \"OSI IS-IS Intra-domain Routing\n   Protocol\", is reclassified\
    \ to Historic status.  This memo also\n   obsoletes RFC 1142.\n"
