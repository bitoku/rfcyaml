  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) [RFC791] provides
    for\n   expansion of the protocol by supporting a number of \"options\" in the\n
    \  variable-length IPv4 header.  IPv4 options are identified by an\n   option
    \"type\" value, whose registration is managed by IANA [IANA-IP].\n   A number
    of IPv4 options have become obsolete in practice, but have\n   never been formally
    deprecated.  This document deprecates such IPv4\n   options, thus cleaning up
    the corresponding IANA registry.\n   This document also obsoletes [RFC1385], [RFC1393],
    [RFC1475], and\n   [RFC1770], and requests that the RFC Editor change their status
    to\n   Historic.\n"

    options being deprecated.  No\n   other reference information has been found.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Stream ID\n   The Stream ID option is obsolete.  It is specified in RFC
      791\n   [RFC791], and is deprecated in Section 3.2.1.8 of RFC 1122 [RFC1122]\n
      \  and Section 4.2.2.1 of RFC 1812 [RFC1812].\n"

  - contents:
    - "2.2.  Extended Internet Protocol\n   The Extended Internet Protocol option
      is defined in [RFC1385] and is\n   superseded by [RFC2460].\n"
    title: 2.2.  Extended Internet Protocol
  - contents:
    - "2.3.  Traceroute\n   The Traceroute option is defined in [RFC1393].  The Traceroute
      option\n   is defined as Experimental; it was never widely deployed on the\n
      \  public Internet.\n"
    title: 2.3.  Traceroute
  - contents:
    - "2.4.  ENCODE\n   This option was used for experimentation around IP-layer encryption.\n
      \  No products are known to ever have shipped with support for this\n   option.\n"

    - "2.7.  Selective Directed Broadcast\n   The Selective Directed Broadcast option
      was originally defined in\n   [RFC1770].  This option was never widely deployed
      and the approach\n   was abandoned.\n"
    title: 2.7.  Selective Directed Broadcast
  - contents:
    - "2.8.  Dynamic Packet State\n   The Dynamic Packet State option was specified
      in [DIFFSERV-DPS].  The\n   aforementioned document was meant to be published
      as Experimental,\n   but it never became an RFC.  The IP option was never widely
      deployed.\n"

  - contents:
    - "2.9.  Upstream Multicast Pkt.\n   This option was originally specified in [BIDIR-PIM].
      \ Its use was\n   deprecated by [RFC5015], which employs a control-plane mechanism
      to\n   solve the problem of doing upstream forwarding of multicast packets\n
