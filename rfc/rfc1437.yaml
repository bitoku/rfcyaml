  - "Abstract\n   A previous document, RFC 1341, defines a format and general framework\n\
    \   for the representation of a wide variety of data types in Internet\n   mail.\
    \  This document defines one particular type of MIME data, the\n   matter-transport/sentient-life-form\
    \ type.  The matter-\n   transport/sentient-life-form MIME type is intended to\
    \ facilitate the\n   wider interoperation of electronic mail messages that include\
    \ entire\n   sentient life forms, such as human beings.\n   Other informally proposed\
    \ subtypes, such as \"non-sentient-life-form\",\n   \"non-sentient-non-life-form\"\
    , and the orthogonally necessary but\n   nevertheless puzzling \"sentient-non-life-form\"\
    , are not described in\n   this memo.\n"
- title: The matter-transport/sentient-life-form MIME type
  contents:
  - "The matter-transport/sentient-life-form MIME type\n   In order to promote the\
    \ wider interoperability of life-bearing email,\n   this document defines a new\
    \ MIME content-type, \"matter-transport\",\n   and for an initial subtype, \"\
    sentient-life-form\".  This subtype was\n   designed to meet the following criteria:\n\
    \      1.  The syntax must be extremely simple to parse, to minimize the\n   \
    \   risk of accidental death due to misinterpretation of the standard.\n     \
    \ 2.  The data format must be extremely robust, with redundancy to\n      ensure\
    \ that individual life forms will survive and be\n      reconstituted in such\
    \ a form as to be nearly indistinguishable\n      from their initial state, no\
    \ matter how many bizarre email\n      gateways are encountered in transit.\n\
    \      3.  The syntax must be extensible to allow for the description of\n   \
    \   all yet-undiscovered aspects of life forms which will be required\n      for\
    \ the transport of non-human species (e.g. dolphins, Klingons,\n      or politicians).\n\
    \      4.  The syntax must be compatible with SGML, so that with an\n      appropriate\
    \ DTD (Document Type Definition -- the standard\n      mechanism for defining\
    \ a document type using SGML), a general SGML\n      parser could be written to\
    \ parse the data structure and produce\n      directives to a lifeform-reconstitution\
    \ mechanism. However,\n      despite this compatibility, the syntax will most\
    \ likely be far\n      simpler than that of full SGML (so that no SGML knowledge\
    \ is\n      required in order to implement it), since it is anticipated that\n\
    \      the full complexities of SGML will not be necessary for the\n      description\
    \ of even arbitrarily complex organic life forms.\n   The syntax of the new content-type\
    \ is very simple, and indeed makes\n   considerable sacrifice of efficiency in\
    \ the interest of simplicity.\n   It is assumed to describe a three-dimensional\
    \ rectangular solid, with\n   the height, width, and depth (calibrated in centimeters)\
    \ specified as\n   parameters on the content-type line.  (In general, this should\
    \ be a\n   cube that completely contains the life form being transported; but,\n\
    \   where high bandwidth is not available, a somewhat smaller cube can be\n  \
    \ used, provided that facilities are known to be available at the\n   recipient's\
    \ end to administer the medical first aid that could be\n   necessary if an individual\
    \ is reconstituted sans some of its\n   extremities.)  A fourth parameter gives\
    \ the resolution of the matter\n   scan, calibrated in Angstroms.  Thus, the following\
    \ Content-type\n   value:\n      Content-type:  matter-transport/sentient-life-form;\n\
    \              height = 200; width = 60; depth=60; resolution=10\n   implies that\
    \ the cube being described is 60 cm by 60 cm by 200 cm,\n   and is described to\
    \ a resolution of 10 Angstroms.  The resolution\n   gives the quantization unit,\
    \ and therefore determines the quality of\n   the reproduction.  The data stream\
    \ itself then consists of a readout\n   of the molecule found at each location,\
    \ using the given resolution.\n   If the resolution is high enough that more than\
    \ one molecule is found\n   in a given location, the molecule whose nucleus is\
    \ closest to the\n   center of the cube is used.  Each molecule is described by\
    \ its\n   molecular formula, rendered in ASCII for maximum readability if\n  \
    \ matter-transport mail is inadvertently delivered to a human recipient\n   and\
    \ displayed on a terminal screen.  Each molecule is followed by a\n   space (ASCII\
    \ 32) to separate it from the subsequent molecule\n   description.  Extremely\
    \ long molecules may require the use of a\n   content-transfer-encoding such as\
    \ quoted-printable, to ensure that\n   line-wrapping mail systems do not, for\
    \ example, cause the unintended\n   breakdown of complex proteins into their constituent\
    \ elements.\n   The following is a message that gives a somewhat simplified rendition\n\
    \   of a well-known American politician, starting from the top:\n   From:  \"\

- title: MHS (X.400) Gateway Considerations
  contents:
  - "MHS (X.400) Gateway Considerations\n   The proper behavior of a MIME/MHS gateway\
    \ with regard to the\n   transmission of complex multimedia messages is a topic\
    \ of ongoing\n   investigation under the auspices of the IETF.  The addition of\
    \ matter\n   transport should not significantly complicate that effort, as it\
    \ is\n   already necessary to specify gateway behavior for MIME types that\n \
    \  have no X.400 equivalents, and matter transport is simply another\n   such\
    \ untranslatable type.\n   However, real-world X.400 gateways might be considered\
    \ to\n   significantly increase the hazard that mail containing a human being\n\
    \   will be rejected with a message so cryptic that the recipient deletes\n  \
    \ it without ever realizing that an embedded human being is enclosed.\n   For\
    \ this reason, it is recommended that the subject of matter\n   transport be explicitly\
    \ marked \"for further study\" in the next\n   generation of the X.400 specification,\
    \ X.400-1996.  This will give\n   the community ample time to define a more complete\
    \ specification for\n   matter transport as part of X.400-2000, and possibly even\
    \ a readily-\n   implementable specification as part of X.400-2004, although some\
    \ will\n   no doubt argue that this would be too strong a break with tradition.\n"
- title: Implementation Considerations
  contents:
  - "Implementation Considerations\n   The user is cautioned against passing MIME\
    \ transporter messages\n   through computers equipped with the NFS file system.\
    \  A no-file space\n   error caused one of the laboratory rats on our prototype\
    \ system to be\n   truncated to a zero-length file.  Unfortunately we had neglected\
    \ to\n   mount a scratch rat.  (We have decided to permanently retain the\n  \
    \ empty filename in his honor).\n   Byte swapping problems on other storage systems\
    \ can be similarly\n   annoying, but should not be a problem if network byte order\
    \ is always\n   maintained ocrrcelty.\n   Despite the authors' belief in the robustness\
    \ of the protocol,\n   passage of email through certain systems seems to result\
    \ in the\n   sentient-life-form arriving at its destination upside down, resulting\n\
    \   in an annoying \"thud\".  The cause is still under investigation.\n   Interoperation\
    \ with matter-transporters using polar coordinate\n   systems is discouraged,\
    \ due to round-off and other algorithmic errors\n   in certain ubiquitous floating-point\
    \ implementations, leading to\n   results which are best discreetly described\
    \ as \"disappointing.\"\n   Similarly, off-by-one errors should be avoided.\n\
    \   Widespread adoption of this protocol may lead to an increase in user\n   demand\
    \ for reliable backup systems.  More importantly, for the first\n   time management\
    \ may be motivated to adequately fund such systems when\n   they discover the\
    \ possibility that proper email backup may confer\n   upon them virtual immortality.\
    \  (On the other hand, implementors\n   should seriously consider the desirability\
    \ of making their managers\n   immortal.)\n   An additional concern reflects the\
    \ fact that, prior to the\n   introduction of this content-type, duplicate mail\
    \ delivery was a\n   relatively minor nuisance.  With the mail extensions described\
    \ in\n   this document, however, comes the possibility that duplicate mail\n \
    \  delivery will leave a user with, for example, multiple spouses or\n   mothers-in-law.\
    \  The relative weights of the desire to avoid\n   duplicate delivery and the\
    \ desire to avoid lost mail may change\n   accordingly.\n"
- title: Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "Security Considerations\n   Security considerations are not discussed in this\
    \ memo.  However, law\n   enforcement officials might wish to consider the possibility\
    \ that\n   this mechanism could be used by criminals, either to escape\n   extradition\
    \ by mailing themselves outside of a legal jurisdiction, or\n   to outwait the\
    \ statute of limitations by mailing themselves through\n   complex mail routes\
    \ with long delays.  (One supposes that they could\n   also look on the bright\
    \ side, and consider MIME as a possible\n   approach to solving the long-standing\
    \ problem of prison\n   overcrowding.)\n"
