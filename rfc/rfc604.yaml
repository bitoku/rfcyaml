  - "                         Assigned Link Numbers\nThis announcement modifies the\
    \ official host-to-host protocol, and\nupdates the defining documents [NIC 8246,\
    \ NIC 9347].  Please note that\nthe information on page 28 of \"Host/Host Protocol\
    \ for the ARPA Network\"\nabout link number assignments is updated by this note,\
    \ and that a\nprevious update [RFC 317, NIC 9347] is completely replaced.  The\n\
    modification is minor and should have no effect on existing network\nprograms\
    \ or usage.  Four of the reserved link numbers are hereby\nassigned for experimental\
    \ use in the testing of an internetworking\nprotocol defined by Kahn and Cerf.\n\
    Description:\n    Control Link\n        Link 0 is assigned for use as the host-to-host\
    \ protocol control\n        link.\n    Data Links\n        Links 2-71 are available\
    \ for use in connections as provided by\n        the host-to-host protocol.\n\
    \    Internetworking Protocol\n        Links 155-158 are to be used for experiments\
    \ with the\n        Internetworking Protocol.\n    Measurements\n        Links\
    \ 159-191 are assigned for use in measurements under the\n        direction of\
    \ the Network Measurement Center at UCLA.\n    Message Switching\n        Links\
    \ 192-195 are to be used for experiments with the Message\n        Switching Protocol.\n\
    \    Private Experiments\n        Links 196-255 are available for private experimental\
    \ use.\n    Reserved\n        Link 1, and links 72-154 are reserved for future\
