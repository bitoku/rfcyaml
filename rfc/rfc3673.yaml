- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) supports a mechanism\n\
    \   for requesting the return of all user attributes but not all\n   operational\
    \ attributes.  This document describes an LDAP extension\n   which clients may\
    \ use to request the return of all operational\n   attributes.\n"
- title: 1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.  Overview\n   X.500 [X.500] provides a mechanism for clients to request all\n\
    \   operational attributes be returned with entries provided in response\n   to\
    \ a search operation.  This mechanism is often used by clients to\n   discover\
    \ which operational attributes are present in an entry.\n   This documents extends\
    \ the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n   (LDAP) [RFC3377] to provide a\
    \ simple mechanism which clients may use\n   to request the return of all operational\
    \ attributes.  The mechanism\n   is designed for use with existing general purpose\
    \ LDAP clients\n   (including web browsers which support LDAP URLs) and existing\
    \ LDAP\n   APIs.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP\
    \ 14 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  All Operational Attributes
  contents:
  - "2.  All Operational Attributes\n   The presence of the attribute description\
    \ \"+\" (ASCII 43) in the list\n   of attributes in a Search Request [RFC2251]\
    \ SHALL signify a request\n   for the return of all operational attributes.\n\
    \   As with all search requests, client implementors should note that\n   results\
    \ may not include all requested attributes due to access\n   controls or other\
    \ restrictions.  Client implementors should also note\n   that certain operational\
    \ attributes may be returned only if requested\n   by name even when \"+\" is\
    \ present.  This is because some operational\n   attributes are very expensive\
    \ to return.\n   Servers supporting this feature SHOULD publish the Object Identifier\n\
    \   1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.5.1 as a value of the 'supportedFeatures'\n   [RFC3674]\
    \ attribute in the root DSE.\n"
- title: 3.  Interoperability Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Interoperability Considerations\n   This mechanism is specifically designed\
    \ to allow users to request all\n   operational attributes using existing LDAP\
    \ clients.  In particular,\n   the mechanism is designed to be compatible with\
    \ existing general\n   purpose LDAP clients including those supporting LDAP URLs\
    \ [RFC2255].\n   The addition of this mechanism to LDAP is not believed to cause\
    \ any\n   significant interoperability issues (this has been confirmed through\n\
    \   testing).  Servers which have yet to implement this specification\n   should\
    \ ignore the \"+\" as an unrecognized attribute description per\n   [RFC2251,\
    \ Section 4.5.1].  From the client's perspective, a server\n   which does not\
    \ return all operational attributes when \"+\" is\n   requested should be viewed\
    \ as having other restrictions.\n   It is also noted that this mechanism is believed\
    \ to require no\n   modification of existing LDAP APIs.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document provides a general mechanism which\
    \ clients may use to\n   discover operational attributes.  Prior to the introduction\
    \ of this\n   mechanism, operational attributes were only returned when requested\n\
    \   by name.  Some might have viewed this as obscurity feature.  However,\n  \
    \ this feature offers a false sense of security as the attributes were\n   still\
    \ transferable.\n   Implementations SHOULD implement appropriate access controls\n\
    \   mechanisms to restricts access to operational attributes.\n"

  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   This document uses the OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.5.1\
