- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   WebDAV [RFC4918] is an extension to HTTP [RFC2616] to support\n\
    \   improved document authoring capabilities.  The WebDAV Access Control\n   Protocol\
    \ (\"WebDAV ACL\") [RFC3744] extension adds access control\n   capabilities to\
    \ WebDAV.  It introduces the concept of a \"principal\"\n   resource, which is\
    \ used to represent information about authenticated\n   entities on the system.\n\
    \   Some clients have a need to determine which [RFC3744] principal a\n   server\
    \ is associating with the currently authenticated HTTP user.\n   While [RFC3744]\
    \ defines a DAV:current-user-privilege-set property for\n   retrieving the privileges\
    \ granted to that principal, there is no\n   recommended way to identify the principal\
    \ in question, which is\n   necessary to perform other useful operations.  For\
    \ example, a client\n   may wish to determine which groups the current user is\
    \ a member of,\n   or modify a property of the principal resource associated with\
    \ the\n   current user.\n   The DAV:principal-match REPORT provides some useful\
    \ functionality,\n   but there are common situations where the results from that\
    \ query can\n   be ambiguous.  For example, not only is an individual user principal\n\
    \   returned, but also every group principal that the user is a member\n   of,\
    \ and there is no clear way to distinguish which is which.\n   This specification\
    \ proposes an extension to WebDAV ACL that adds a\n   DAV:current-user-principal\
    \ property to resources under access control\n   on the server.  This property\
    \ provides a URL to a principal resource\n   corresponding to the currently authenticated\
    \ user.  This allows a\n   client to \"bootstrap\" itself by performing additional\
    \ queries on the\n   principal resource to obtain additional information from\
    \ that\n   resource, which is the purpose of this extension.  Note that while\
    \ it\n   is possible for multiple URLs to refer to the same principal\n   resource,\
    \ or for multiple principal resources to correspond to a\n   single principal,\
    \ this specification only allows for a single http(s)\n   URL in the DAV:current-user-principal\
    \ property.  If a client wishes\n   to obtain alternate URLs for the principal,\
    \ it can query the\n   principal resource for this information; it is not the\
    \ purpose of\n   this extension to provide a complete list of such URLs, but simply\
    \ to\n   provide a means to locate a resource which contains that (and other)\n\
    \   information.\n"

  - "2.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n   When XML element types in the namespace \"DAV:\" are referenced\
    \ in this\n   document outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string \"\
    DAV:\"\n   will be prefixed to the element type names.\n   Processing of XML by\
    \ clients and servers MUST follow the rules\n   defined in Section 17 of WebDAV\
    \ [RFC4918].\n   Some of the declarations refer to XML elements defined by WebDAV\n\
    \   [RFC4918].\n"
- title: 3.  DAV:current-user-principal
  contents:
  - "3.  DAV:current-user-principal\n   Name:  current-user-principal\n   Namespace:\
    \  DAV:\n   Purpose:  Indicates a URL for the currently authenticated user's\n\
    \      principal resource on the server.\n   Value:  A single DAV:href or DAV:unauthenticated\
    \ element.\n   Protected:  This property is computed on a per-request basis, and\n\
    \      therefore is protected.\n   Description:  The DAV:current-user-principal\
    \ property contains either\n      a DAV:href or DAV:unauthenticated XML element.\
    \  The DAV:href\n      element contains a URL to a principal resource corresponding\
    \ to\n      the currently authenticated user.  That URL MUST be one of the\n \
    \     URLs in the DAV:principal-URL or DAV:alternate-URI-set properties\n    \
    \  defined on the principal resource and MUST be an http(s) scheme\n      URL.\
    \  When authentication has not been done or has failed, this\n      property MUST\
    \ contain the DAV:unauthenticated pseudo-principal.\n      In some cases, there\
    \ may be multiple principal resources\n      corresponding to the same authenticated\
    \ principal.  In that case,\n      the server is free to choose any one of the\
    \ principal resource\n      URIs for the value of the DAV:current-user-principal\
    \ property.\n      However, servers SHOULD be consistent and use the same principal\n\
    \      resource URI for each authenticated principal.\n   COPY/MOVE behavior:\
    \  This property is computed on a per-request\n      basis, and is thus never\
    \ copied or moved.\n   Definition:\n      <!ELEMENT current-user-principal (unauthenticated\
    \ | href)>\n      <!-- href value: a URL to a principal resource -->\n   Example:\n\
    \      <D:current-user-principal xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n        <D:href>/principals/users/cdaboo</D:href>\n\
    \      </D:current-user-principal>\n"
