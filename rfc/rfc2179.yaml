- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document is designed to assist vendors and other participants\
    \ in\n   trade shows, such as Networld+Interop, in designing effective\n   protection\
    \ against network and system attacks by unauthorized\n   individuals.  Generally,\
    \ it has been observed that many system\n   administrators and trade show coordinators\
    \ tend to overlook the\n   importance of system security at trade shows. In fact,\
    \ systems at\n   trade shows are at least as prone to attack as office-based\n\
    \   platforms. Trade show systems should be treated as seriously as an\n   office\
    \ computer. A breach of security of a trade show system can\n   render -- and\
    \ has rendered -- an exhibitor's demonstrations\n   inoperable -- sometimes for\
    \ the entire event!\n   This document is not intended to replace the multitudes\
    \ of\n   comprehensive books on the subject of Internet security.  Rather, its\n\
    \   purpose is to provide a checklist-style collection of frequently\n   overlooked,\
    \ simple ways to minimize the chance of a costly attack.\n   We encourage exhibitors\
    \ to pay special attention to this document and\n   share it with all associated\
    \ representatives.\n"
- title: Physical Security
  contents:
  - "Physical Security\n   Before addressing technical security issues, one of the\
    \ most\n   frequently underrated and overlooked security breaches is the simple\n\
    \   low-tech attack.  The common victim is the one who leaves a console\n   logged\
    \ in, perhaps as root, and leaves the system.  Other times, an\n   anonymous \"\
    helpful soul\" might ask for a password in order to assist\n   the user in \"\
    identifying a problem.\"  This type of method allows an\n   intruder, especially\
    \ one logged in as \"root\", access to system files.\n   Tips:\n   * Educate sales\
    \ and support staff regarding system logins, especially\n     \"root\" or other\
    \ privileged accounts.\n   * Identify individuals who are not using exhibit systems\
    \ for their\n     intended purpose, especially non-booth personnel.\n   * Request\
    \ identification from anyone wishing to access systems\n     for maintenance purposes\
    \ unless their identities are known.\n"
- title: System Security
  contents:
  - "System Security\n   This section discusses technical security procedures for\
    \ workstations\n   on the vendor network.  Although specifics tend to be for Unix\n\
    \   systems, general procedures apply to all platforms.\n"
- title: Password Security
  contents:
  - "Password Security\n   Lack of passwords or easy to guess passwords are a relatively\
    \ low-\n   tech door into systems, but are responsible for a significant number\n\
    \   of breakins. Good passwords are a cornerstone of system security.\n   By default,\
    \ PC operating systems like Windows 95 and MacOS do not\n   provide adequate password\
    \ security. The Windows login password\n   provides no security (hitting the \"\
    ESC\" key allows the user to bypass\n   password entry). Password security for\
    \ these machines is possible,\n   but is beyond the scope of this document.\n\
    \   Tips:\n   * Check /etc/passwd on Unix systems and the user administration\n\
    \     application on other systems for lack of passwords. Some vendors\n     ship\
    \ systems with null passwords, in some cases even for\n     privileged accounts.\n\
    \   * Change passwords, especially system and root passwords.\n   * Mix case,\
    \ numbers and punctuation, especially on privileged\n     accounts.\n   * Change\
    \ system passwords on a regular basis.\n   * Do not use passwords relating to\
    \ the event, the company, or\n     products being displayed.  Systems personnel\
    \ at Networld+Interop,\n     when asked to assist booth personnel, often guess\
    \ even root\n     passwords!\n"
- title: Extra Privileged Accounts
  contents:
  - "Extra Privileged Accounts\n   Some system vendors have been known to ship systems\
    \ with multiple\n   privileged accounts (for example, Unix systems with accounts\
    \ that\n   have root privileges [UID=0]). Some vendors may include a separate\n\
    \   system administration account that places a user in a specific\n   administrative\
    \ program. Each additional privileged account presents\n   yet another opportunity\
    \ for abuse.\n   Generally, if a Unix system does not need additional root accounts,\n\
    \   these can be disabled by placing \"*\" in the password field of\n   /etc/passwd,\
    \ or by using the administrative tool when a system\n   employees enhanced security.\
    \ Verify all systems for extra privileged\n   accounts and either disable them\
    \ or change their password as\n   appropriate.\n   Make certain that privileged\
    \ accounts are inaccessible from anywhere\n   other than the system console. \
    \ Frequently systems rely on files such\n   as /etc/securettys for a list of \"\
    secure\" terminals.  As a general\n   rule, unless a terminal is in this file,\
    \ a root login is not\n   possible.  Specific use of this feature should be covered\
    \ in the\n   system's documentation files.\n   Tips:\n   * Check /etc/passwd on\
    \ Unix systems and the user administration\n     application on other systems\
    \ for additional privileged accounts.\n   * Disable remote login for privileged\
    \ accounts.\n   * Disable any unnecessary privileged accounts.\n   * Limit logins\
    \ from root accounts to \"secure\" terminals or the\n     system console.\n"
- title: Use of Authentication Tokens
  contents:
  - "Use of Authentication Tokens\n   Authentication tokens such as SecureID, Cryptocard,\
    \ DES Gold and\n   others, provide a method of producing \"one-time\" passwords.\
    \  The\n   principle advantage in a trade-show environment is to render\n   worthless,\
    \ packets captured by sniffers on the network.  It should be\n   treated as fact,\
    \ that there are many packet sniffers and other\n   administration tools constantly\
    \ (legitimately) watching the network-\n   -especially at a large network-oriented\
    \ trade show. Typed passwords,\n   by default, are sent clear text across the\
    \ network, allowing others\n   to view them. Authentication tokens provide a password\
    \ that is only\n   valid for that one instance, and are useless after that.  A\
    \ logical\n   extension of the use of authentication tokens would be to use them\n\
    \   for \"trips home\" (from the show network to a home site) to minimize\n  \
    \ the chance of off-site security problems.\n   An alternative to these tokens\
    \ is the secure shell (\"ssh\") protocol\n   which provides an encrypted connection\
    \ between clients and servers.\n   This connection can carry both login traffic\
    \ and arbitrary port-to-\n   port communication, and is a powerful tool for securing\
    \ an in-booth\n   network and communications to and from remote systems.\n   Tips:\n\
    \   * Contact vendors of authentication tokens/cards for further\n     information\
    \ as to how to integrate into specific environments, or\n     on to specific platforms.\n\
    \   * The public-domain utility \"cryptosu\" (csu), when used with a\n     Cryptocard,\
    \ provides a replacement for Unix's \"su\" command,\n     employing a challenge/response\
    \ style of authentication for root\n     access.\n   * Explore the use of ssh\
    \ clients and servers.\n"
- title: Anonymous FTP
  contents:
  - "Anonymous FTP\n   Anonymous FTP accounts can easily turn into a security hole.\
    \  Disable\n   this service if not specifically needed.  In the event that anonymous\n\
    \   FTP is to be used, the following tips may help secure it.\n   * When a user\
    \ logs in as \"anonymous\", they should be locked into a\n     specific directory\
    \ tree. Be sure that FTPd properly chroots to the\n     appropriate directory.\
    \ A \"cd /\" should put an anonymous user at the\n     top of the \"public\" tree,\
    \ and not the system's root directory.\n   * Some systems may allow symbolic links\
    \ (or \"shortcuts\") to take a\n     user outside the allowed tree. Verify all\
    \ links inside the\n     anonymous FTP hierarchy.\n   * Make sure that ftp's root\
    \ directory is \"owned\" by someone other\n     than the 'ftp' account. Typically,\
    \ it should be owned by \"root\".\n   * Do not use a world-writable incoming directory\
    \ unless absolutely\n     necessary. Many sites use these as a way for users to\
    \ transfer\n     files into the site. This can, and frequently does, turn into\
    \ an\n     archive for stolen software (referred to by the pirate community as\n\
    \     \"warez\").\n   * Removing read permissions from the directory permissions\
    \ (chmod 733\n     on Unix systems) prohibits an anonymous user from being able\
    \ to\n     list the contents of a directory. Files can be deposited as usual,\n\
    \     but not retrieved unless the user knows the exact name of the file.\n"
- title: Network File Sharing
  contents:
  - "Network File Sharing\n   Writable file shares without some form of security are\
    \ invitations to\n   destruction of information and demonstrations. Whether using\
    \ NFS on\n   Unix systems, or PC sharing facilities like CIFS, AppleShare, or\n\
    \   NetWare, close attention should be paid to security of the files\n   exported.\
    \  Keep in mind that one's competition frequently shares the\n   same network\
    \ at a trade show!  Security for both read and write\n   access should be employed\
    \ and each access point examined.\n   Exporting a writable NFS filesystem to the\
    \ world grants anyone the\n   ability to read and write any file in the exported\
    \ mount point. If\n   this is done, for example, with a system directory such\
    \ as \"/\" or\n   \"/etc\", it is a simple matter to edit password files to create\
    \ one-\n   self access to a system. Therefore, /etc/exports should be closely\n\
    \   examined to be certain that nothing of a sensitive nature is exported\n  \
    \ to anyone but another trusted host. Anything exported to the general\n   public\
    \ should be exported \"read-only\", and verified for the\n   information that\
    \ is available via the file shares.\n   Tips:\n   * Do not provide file sharing\
    \ space unless needed.\n   * Verify where exported information will be \"visible\"\
    .\n   * Do not maintain any writable shares unless absolutely necessary!\n"
- title: Trusted Hosts
  contents:
  - "Trusted Hosts\n   Trusted host entries are a method for allowing other hosts\n\
    \   \"equivalent\" security access to another host computer. Some vendors\n  \
    \ ship systems with open trusted host files.  Make certain that this\n   issue\
    \ is addressed.\n   Tips:\n   * On Unix systems, check for a '+' entry (all systems\
    \ trusted) in\n     /etc/hosts.equiv and all \".rhosts\" files (there may be multiple\n\
    \     .rhosts files) and remove it.\n   * Check for an \"xhost +\" entry in the\
    \ \"...X11/xdm/Xsession\" file.\n     Most often, an \"xhost\" entry will appear\
    \ with a pathname such as\n     \"/usr/local/lib/xhost +\". Remove this.\n"
- title: SetUID and SetGID binaries (Unix systems)
  contents:
  - "SetUID and SetGID binaries (Unix systems)\n   On Unix systems, the \"suid\" bit\
    \ on a system executable program allows\n   the program to execute as the owner.\
    \ A program that is setUID to\n   \"root\" will allow the program to execute with\
    \ root privileges. There\n   are multiple legitimate reasons for a program to\
    \ have root\n   privileges, and many do. However, it may be unusual to have suid\n\
    \   programs in individual user directories or other non-system places. A\n  \
    \ scan of the filesystems can turn up any program with its suid or sgid\n   bit\
    \ set.  Before disabling any programs, check the legitimacy of the\n   files.\n\
    \   Tips:\n   * \"find / -user root -perm -4000 -print\" will find any occurrence\
    \ of\n     a setuid file anywhere in the system, including those on NFS\n    \
    \ mounted partitions.\n   * \"find / -group kmem -perm -2000 -print\" will do\
    \ the same for kmem\n     group permissions.\n"
- title: System Directory Ownership and Write Permissions
  contents:
  - "System Directory Ownership and Write Permissions\n   Check ownership of all system\
    \ directories and permissions needed to\n   write or modify files. There is no\
    \ simple way to do this on PC\n   operating systems like Windows NT without simply\
    \ checking all files\n   and directories or using a version of \"ls\" that will\
    \ list ACLs.\n   On Unix systems, a directory with permissions such as \"drwxrwxrwx\"\
    \n   (such as /tmp) is world-writable and anyone can create or modify\n   files\
    \ in such area. Pay special attention to \"/\" and \"/etc\". These\n   should\
    \ be owned by some system account-not by an individual user.\n   When in doubt,\
    \ contact the vendor of the system software for\n   confirmation of the appropriate\
    \ directory or file permissions.\n"
- title: Network Services
  contents:
  - "Network Services\n   Any servers not needed should be disabled. The notorious\
    \ \"R services\"\n   (rexec, rsh, and rlogin) are particularly prone to security\
    \ problems\n   and should be disabled unless specifically needed.  Pay particular\n\
    \   attention to trusted hosts files, and be aware of the risk of IP\n   spoofing\
    \ attacks from machines \"pretending\" to be trusted hosts.\n   Tips:\n   * On\
    \ Unix systems, comment out \"R services\" (rexec, rsh, rlogin) in\n     /etc/inetd.conf.\n\
    \   * Check for other unknown or unneeded services.\n"
- title: Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)
  contents:
  - "Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)\n   TFTP can be an easy way for an intruder\
    \ to access system files. It is\n   good general practice to disable TFTP.  If\
    \ TFTP is needed, verify\n   that only files targeted for export are accessible.\
    \  A simple way to\n   check security is to attempt to tftp files such as /etc/passwd\

    \   recent release for the platform.\n"
- title: Web Server Scripting Security
  contents:
  - "Web Server Scripting Security\n   All Web server scripts and binaries should\
    \ be checked (especially the\n   \"...httpd/cgi-bin\" directory) for those that\
    \ allow shell commands to\n   be executed. Many attacks in recent months have\
    \ focused on the use of\n   utilities such as \"phf\" for accessing /etc/passwd\
    \ on a target system.\n   Remove any script that is not needed in the course of\
    \ operation of a\n   web server.\n"
- title: Other Suggestions
  contents:
  - "Other Suggestions\n   * Check with the vendor of the operating system for known\
    \ security\n     issues. Make certain that all systems have the latest version\
    \ of\n     software--especially security patches to fix specific problems.\n \
    \  * Examine log files on the host frequently. On Unix systems, the\n     \"last\"\
    \ command will furnish information on recent logins and where\n     they came\
    \ from. The \"syslogs\" or \"Event Viewer\" will contain more\n     specific information\
    \ on system events.\n   * Web server logfiles (...httpd/log/access_log and\n \
    \    ...httpd/log/error_log) will contain information on who has been\n     accessing\
    \ a WWW server, what has been accessed, and what has\n     failed.\n   * Good\
    \ backups are the best defense against system damage. Perform\n     backups before\
    \ placing a system on the trade show network then\n     continue backups throughout\
    \ the show and again following the event.\n     A final backup set is useful to\
    \ examine for possible attempts at\n     (or successful) penetrations of system\
    \ security.\n"
- title: General Network Security
  contents:
  - "General Network Security\n   As would be expected at network trade shows (large\
    \ or otherwise),\n   there are many entities running packet sniffers. Most are\
    \ exhibitors\n   who have a legitimate need to run them during the course of product\n\
    \   demonstrations. However, be aware that there are many \"listening\n   ears\"\
    \ on network segments--any of whom can \"hear\" or \"see\"\n   information as\
    \ it crosses the net. Particularly prone to\n   eavesdropping are telnet sessions.\
    \ A good rule of thumb is to assume\n   that \"when you type your password, the\
    \ only one that doesn't see it\n   is you!\"\n   It is a good practice to not\
    \ log in (or \"su\") to an account with\n   privileges across the network if at\
    \ all possible. As mentioned\n   previously, authentication tokens and ssh are\
    \ a simple way to add\n   security to system account access.\n"
- title: Packet Filtering
  contents:
  - "Packet Filtering\n   Many routers support basic packet filtering.  If a router\
    \ can be\n   deployed between the local network and the show's network, general\n\
    \   basic packet filtering should be employed.  Below is a good \"general\"\n\
    \   packet filter approach. The approach itself is ordered into\n   categories:\n\
    \   * General global denials/acceptance.\n   * Specific global service denials.\n\
    \   * Specific service acceptance.\n   * Final denial of all other TCP/UDP services.\n\
    \   Based on the theory of denying everything that you don't know is\n   acceptable\
    \ traffic, a good approach to a filter ruleset, in order of\n   execution priority,\
    \ might be:\n   General Global Denials/Acceptance\n   1 Filter spoofed source\
    \ addresses by interface. Match source\n     addresses to routing information\
    \ available for the interface.\n     Discard packets with source addresses arriving\
    \ on one interface\n     (from the \"outside\" for example) claiming a source\
    \ address on\n     another interface (the \"inside\").\n   2 Filter all source\
    \ routed packets unless source routing is\n     specifically needed.\n   3 Allow\
    \ outbound connections from \"inside\" hosts.\n   4 Allow established TCP connections\
    \ (protocol field contains 6 and\n     the TCP flags field either contains ACK\
    \ or does NOT contain SYN\n     bit). Only filter requests for 'new' connections.\n\
    \   5 Filter 'new' connections with source port of 25. Prevents people\n     from\
    \ pretending to be a remote mail server.\n   6 Filter loopback address (source\
    \ address 127.0.0.1). Prevents\n     packets from a misconfigured DNS resolver.\n\
    \   Specific Global Service Denials\n   1 Specifically block all \"R-command\"\
    \ ports\n     (destination ports 512-515).\n   2 Block telnet (destination port\
    \ 23) from any host not requiring\n     telnet access from the outside. (If you\
    \ use ssh, you can\n     block it from all hosts!)\n   3 Add specific filters\
    \ to deny other specific protocols to the\n     network, as needed.\n   Specific\
    \ Host/Service Acceptance\n   1 Add specific access to specific \"public\" hosts'\
    \ services\n     (unsecure FTP or WWW servers).\n   2 Allow SMTP (source and destination\
    \ port 25) for electronic mail\n     to the mail server(s).\n   3 Allow inbound\
    \ FTP connections (source port 20) to the FTP server(s).\n   4 Allow DNS (source\
    \ and destination port 53, UDP & TCP) to name servers.\n     If zone transfers\
    \ are not needed, block the TCP ports.\n   5 Allow RIP packets in (source and\
    \ destination port 520, UDP), if\n     appropriate.\n   6 Add specific filters\
    \ to allow other desired specific protocols\n     or to open certain ports to\
    \ specific machines.\n   Final Service Denial\n   1 Deny all other UDP and TCP\
    \ services not allowed by the previous\n     filters.\n"
