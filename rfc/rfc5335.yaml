  contents:
  - "1.1.  Role of This Specification\n   Full internationalization of electronic\
    \ mail requires several\n   capabilities:\n   o  The capability to transmit non-ASCII\
    \ content, provided for as part\n      of the basic MIME specification [RFC2045],\
    \ [RFC2046].\n   o  The capability to use international characters in envelope\n\
    \      addresses, discussed in [RFC4952] and specified in [RFC5336].\n   o  The\
    \ capability to express those addresses, and information related\n      to them\
    \ and based on them, in mail header fields, defined in this\n      document.\n\
    \   This document specifies an experimental variant of Internet mail that\n  \
    \ permits the use of Unicode encoded in UTF-8 [RFC3629], rather than\n   ASCII,\
    \ as the base form for Internet email header fields.  This form\n   is permitted\
    \ in transmission, if authorized by the SMTP extension\n   specified in [RFC5336]\
    \ or by other transport mechanisms capable of\n   processing it.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Relation to Other Standards
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Relation to Other Standards\n   This document updates Section 6.4 of RFC\
    \ 2045.  It removes the\n   blanket ban on applying a content-transfer-encoding\
    \ to all subtypes\n   of message/, and instead specifies that a composite subtype\
    \ MAY\n   specify whether or not a content-transfer-encoding can be used for\n\
    \   that subtype, with \"cannot be used\" as the default.\n   This document also\
    \ updates [RFC2822] and MIME ([RFC2045]), and the\n   fact that an Experimental\
    \ specification updates a Standards-Track\n   specification means that people\
    \ who participate in the experiment\n   have to consider those standards updated.\n\
    \   Allowing use of a content-transfer-encoding on subtypes of messages\n   is\
    \ not limited to transmissions that are authorized by the SMTP\n   extension specified\
    \ in [RFC5336].  Message/global permits use of a\n   content-transfer-encoding.\n"
- title: 2.  Background and History
  contents:
  - "2.  Background and History\n   Mailbox names often represent the names of human\
    \ users.  Many of\n   these users throughout the world have names that are not\
    \ normally\n   expressed with just the ASCII repertoire of characters, and would\n\
    \   like to use more or less their real names in their mailbox names.\n   These\
    \ users are also likely to use non-ASCII text in their common\n   names and subjects\
    \ of email messages, both received and sent.  This\n   protocol specifies UTF-8\
    \ as the encoding to represent email header\n   field bodies.\n   The traditional\
    \ format of email messages [RFC2822] allows only ASCII\n   characters in the header\
    \ fields of messages.  This prevents users\n   from having email addresses that\
    \ contain non-ASCII characters.  It\n   further forces non-ASCII text in common\
    \ names, comments, and in free\n   text (such as in the Subject: field) to be\
    \ encoded (as required by\n   MIME format [RFC2047]).  This specification describes\
    \ a change to the\n   email message format that is related to the SMTP message\
    \ transport\n   change described in the associated document [RFC4952] and [RFC5336],\n\
    \   and that allows non-ASCII characters in most email header fields.\n   These\
    \ changes affect SMTP clients, SMTP servers, mail user agents\n   (MUAs), list\
    \ expanders, gateways to other media, and all other\n   processes that parse or\
    \ handle email messages.\n   As specified in [RFC5336], an SMTP protocol extension\
    \ \"UTF8SMTP\" is\n   used to prevent the transmission of messages with UTF-8\
    \ header fields\n   to systems that cannot handle such messages.\n   Use of this\
    \ SMTP extension helps prevent the introduction of such\n   messages into message\
    \ stores that might misinterpret, improperly\n   display, or mangle such messages.\
    \  It should be noted that using an\n   ESMTP extension does not prevent transferring\
    \ email messages with\n   UTF-8 header fields to other systems that use the email\
    \ format for\n   messages and that may not be upgraded, such as unextended POP\
    \ and\n   IMAP servers.  Changes to these protocols to handle UTF-8 header\n \
    \  fields are addressed in [EAI-POP] and [IMAP-UTF8] .\n   The objective for this\
    \ protocol is to allow UTF-8 in email header\n   fields.  Issues such as how to\
    \ handle messages containing UTF-8\n   header fields that have to be delivered\
    \ to systems that have not been\n   upgraded to support this capability are discussed\
    \ in [DOWNGRADE].\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Terminology\n   A plain ASCII string is also a valid UTF-8 string; see [RFC3629].\
    \  In\n   this document, ordinary ASCII characters are UTF-8 characters if they\n\
    \   are in headers which contain <utf8-xtra-char>s.\n   Unless otherwise noted,\
    \ all terms used here are defined in [RFC2821],\n   [RFC2822], [RFC4952], or [RFC5336].\n\

- title: 4.  Changes on Message Header Fields
  contents:
  - "4.  Changes on Message Header Fields\n   SMTP clients can send header fields\
    \ in UTF-8 format, if the UTF8SMTP\n   extension is advertised by the SMTP server\
    \ or is permitted by other\n   transport mechanisms.\n   This protocol does NOT\
    \ change the [RFC2822] rules for defining header\n   field names.  The bodies\
    \ of header fields are allowed to contain\n   UTF-8 characters, but the header\
    \ field names themselves must contain\n   only ASCII characters.\n   To permit\
    \ UTF-8 characters in field values, the header definition in\n   [RFC2822] must\
    \ be extended to support the new format.  The following\n   ABNF is defined to\
    \ substitute those definitions in [RFC2822].\n   The syntax rules not covered\
    \ in this section remain as defined in\n   [RFC2822].\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  UTF-8 Syntax and Normalization\n   UTF-8 characters can be defined in terms\

- title: 4.2.  Changes on MIME Headers
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Changes on MIME Headers\n   This specification updates Section 6.4 of [RFC2045].\
    \  [RFC2045]\n   prohibits applying a content-transfer-encoding to all subtypes\
    \ of\n   message/.  This specification relaxes the rule -- it allows newly\n \
    \  defined MIME types to permit content-transfer-encoding, and it allows\n   content-transfer-encoding\
    \ for message/global (see Section 4.6).\n   Background: Normally, transfer of\
    \ message/global will be done in\n   8-bit-clean channels, and body parts will\
    \ have \"identity\" encodings,\n   that is, no decoding is necessary.  In the\
    \ case where a message\n   containing a message/global is downgraded from 8-bit\
    \ to 7-bit as\n   described in [RFC1652], an encoding may be applied to the message;\
    \ if\n   the message travels multiple times between a 7-bit environment and an\n\
    \   environment implementing UTF8SMTP, multiple levels of encoding may\n   occur.\
    \  This is expected to be rarely seen in practice, and the\n   potential complexity\
    \ of other ways of dealing with the issue are\n   thought to be larger than the\
    \ complexity of allowing nested encodings\n   where necessary.\n"

    \  Note that, should downgrading be required, the uFor\n   parameter is dropped\
    \ per the procedure specified in [DOWNGRADE].\n   The \"Return-Path\" header provides\

  contents:
  - "4.6.  message/global\n   Internationalized messages must only be transmitted\
    \ as authorized by\n   [RFC5336] or within a non-SMTP environment which supports\

    \ contains UTF-8 header values as specified in this document, or\n   o  it contains\
    \ UTF-8 values in the headers fields of body parts.\n   The type message/global\
    \ is similar to message/rfc822, except that it\n   contains a message that can\
    \ contain UTF-8 characters in the headers\n   of the message or body parts.  If\
    \ this type is sent to a 7-bit-only\n   system, it has to be encoded in MIME [RFC2045].\
    \  (Note that a system\n   compliant with MIME that doesn't recognize message/global\
    \ would treat\n   it as \"application/octet-stream\" as described in Section 5.2.4\
    \ of\n   [RFC2046].)\n   Alternatively, SMTP servers and other systems which transfer\

    \ considerations:  The media type provides\n      functionality similar to the\

    \  Both of\n      these choices will interoperate with the installed base, but\
    \ with\n      different properties.  Systems unaware of international headers\n\
    \      will typically treat a message/global body part as an unknown\n      attachment,\
    \ while they will understand the structure of a message/\n      rfc822.  However,\
    \ systems that understand message/global will\n      provide functionality superior\
    \ to the result of a down-conversion\n      to message/rfc822.  The most interoperable\

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   If a user has a non-ASCII mailbox address and\
    \ an ASCII mailbox\n   address, a digital certificate that identifies that user\
    \ may have\n   both addresses in the identity.  Having multiple email addresses\
    \ as\n   identities in a single certificate is already supported in PKIX\n   (Public\
    \ Key Infrastructure for X.509 Certificates) and OpenPGP.\n   Because UTF-8 often\
    \ requires several octets to encode a single\n   character, internationalized\
    \ local parts may cause mail addresses to\n   become longer.  As specified in\
    \ [RFC2822], each line of characters\n   MUST be no more 998 octets, excluding\
    \ the CRLF.\n   Because internationalized local parts may cause email addresses\
    \ to be\n   longer, processes that parse, store, or handle email addresses or\n\
    \   local parts must take extra care not to overflow buffers, truncate\n   addresses,\
    \ or exceed storage allotments.  Also, they must take care,\n   when comparing,\
    \ to use the entire lengths of the addresses.\n   In this specification, a user\
    \ could provide an ASCII alternative\n   address for a non-ASCII address.  However,\
    \ it is possible these two\n   addresses go to different mailboxes, or even different\
    \ people.  This\n   configuration may be based on a user's personal choice or\
    \ on\n   administration policy.  We recognize that if ASCII and non-ASCII\n  \
    \ email is delivered to two different destinations, based on MTA\n   capability,\
    \ this may violate the principle of least astonishment, but\n   this is not a\
    \ \"protocol problem\".\n   The security impact of UTF-8 headers on email signature\
    \ systems such\n   as Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM), S/MIME, and OpenPGP\
    \ is\n   discussed in RFC 4952, Section 9.  A subsequent document [DOWNGRADE]\n\
    \   will cover the impact of downgrading on these systems.\n"
