  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) was initially developed
    for two very\n   specific use cases.  Initially, it was intended to be used for\n
    \  reporting feedback between large email operators, or from large email\n   operators
    to end user network access operators, any of whom could be\n   presumed to have
    automated abuse-handling systems.  Secondarily, it\n   is used by those same large
    mail operators to send those same reports\n   to other entities, including those
    involved in sending bulk email for\n   commercial purposes.  In either case, the
    reports would be triggered\n   by direct end user action such as clicking on a
    \"report spam\" button\n   in their email client.\n   Though other uses for ARF
    as defined in [RFC5965] have been discussed\n   (and may be documented similarly
    in the future), abuse reporting\n   remains the primary application, with a small
    amount of adoption of\n   extensions that enable authentication failure reporting.\n
    \  This applicability statement provides direction for using ARF in both\n   contexts.
    \ It also includes some statements about the use of ARF in\n   conjunction with
    other email technologies.\n   The purpose for reporting abusive messages is to
    stop recurrences.\n   The methods described in this document focus on automating
    abuse\n   reporting as much as practical, so as to minimize the work of a\n   site's
    abuse team.  There are further reasons why abuse feedback\n   generation is worthwhile,
    such as instruction of mail filters or\n   reputation trackers, or initiation
    of investigations of particularly\n   egregious abuses.  These other applications
    are not discussed in\n   this memo.\n   Further introduction to this topic may
    be found in [RFC6449], which\n   has more information about the general topic
    of abuse reporting.\n   Many of the specific ARF guidelines in this document were
    taken from\n   the principles presented in [RFC6449].\n   At the time of publication
    of this document, five feedback types are\n   registered.  This document only
    discusses two of them (\"abuse\"\n   [RFC5965] and \"auth-failure\" [RFC6591]),
    as they are seeing\n   sufficient use in practice that applicability statements
    can be made\n   about them.  The others, i.e., \"fraud\" [RFC5965], \"other\"
    [RFC5965],\n   and \"not-spam\" [RFC6430], are either too new or too seldom used
    to be\n   included here.\n"

    most common, application of\n   [RFC5965] is when two mail systems make a private
    agreement to\n   exchange abuse reports -- usually reports due to recipients manually\n
    \  reporting messages as spam.  We refer to these as solicited reports.\n   Other
    uses for ARF involve such reports sent between parties that\n   don't know each
    other.  These unsolicited reports are sent without\n   prior arrangement between
    the parties as to the context and meaning\n   of the reports.  Therefore, the
    constraints on how these unsolicited\n   reports need to be structured such that
    they are likely to be useful\n   to the recipient -- e.g., to what address(es)
    they can usefully be\n   sent, what issues they can be used to report, and how
    they can be\n   handled by the receiver of the report -- are very different.\n
    \  The two cases are covered separately in the sections that follow.\n"

      receives reports of abusive or unwanted mail from\n   its users, most often
      by providing a \"report spam\" button (or similar\n   nomenclature) in the MUA
      (Mail User Agent).  The method of\n   transferring this message and any associated
      metadata from the MUA to\n   the Mailbox Provider's ARF processing system is
      not defined by any\n   standards document but is discussed further in Section
      3.2 of\n   [RFC6449].  Policy concerns related to the collection of this data\n
      \  are discussed in Section 3.4 of [RFC6449].\n   To implement the recommendations
      of this memo, the reports are\n   formatted per [RFC5965] and transmitted as
      an email message\n   [RFC5322], typically using SMTP [RFC5321].\n   Ongoing

      \  However, to allow for handling of new types that are not yet\n   supported,
      an automated report processing system MUST NOT reject (in\n   the SMTP sense)
      a report based solely on an unknown Feedback-Type.\n   The automated system
      can simply set reports of unknown types aside\n   for manual handling.  However,
      Mailbox Providers might only make use\n   of the \"abuse\" Feedback-Type.  Therefore,
      report receivers might be\n   required to do additional analysis to separate
      different types of\n   abuse reports after receipt if they do not have prior
      specific\n   knowledge of the sender of the report.\n   Report receivers MUST
      accept reports that have obscured their user-\n   identifiable data as described

      capable of throttling\n   reports being sent to avoid damage to their own installations.\n
      \  Therefore, Feedback Providers MUST provide a way for report\n   recipients
      to request that no further reports be sent.\n   Unfortunately, no standardized
      mechanism for such requests exists to\n   date, and all existing mechanisms
      for meeting this requirement are\n   out-of-band.\n   Message authentication
      is generally a good idea, but it is especially\n   important to encourage credibility
      of, and thus response to,\n   unsolicited reports.  Therefore, as with any other
      message, Feedback\n   Providers sending unsolicited reports SHOULD send reports
      that they\n   expect will pass the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) [RFC4408] and/or\n
      \  DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) [RFC6376] checks.\n"
    title: 5.1.  General Considerations
  - contents:
    - "5.2.  When to Generate Reports\n   Handling of unsolicited reports has a significant
      cost to the report\n   receiver.  Senders of unsolicited reports, especially
      those sending\n   large volumes of them automatically, SHOULD NOT send reports
      that\n   cannot be used as a basis for action by the recipient, whether this\n
      \  is due to the report being sent about an incident that is not abuse-\n   related,
      the report being sent to an email address that won't result\n   in action, or
      the content or format of the report being hard for the\n   recipient to read
      or use.\n   Feedback Providers SHOULD NOT report all mail sent from a particular\n
      \  sender merely because some of it is determined to be abusive.\n   Mechanical
      reports of mail that \"looks like\" spam, based solely on\n   the results of
      inline content analysis tools, SHOULD NOT be sent\n   since, because of their
      subjective nature, they are unlikely to\n   provide a basis for the recipient
      to take action.  Complaints\n   generated by end users about mail that is determined
      by them to be\n   abusive, or mail delivered to \"spam trap\" or \"honeypot\"
      addresses,\n   are far more likely to be accurate and MAY be sent.\n   If a
      Feedback Provider applies SPF [RFC4408] to arriving messages, a\n   report SHOULD
      NOT be generated to the RFC5321.MailFrom domain if the\n   SPF evaluation produced
      a \"Fail\", \"SoftFail\", \"TempError\", or\n   \"PermError\" report, as no
      reliable assertion or assumption can be\n   made that use of the domain was
      authorized.  A valid exception would\n   be specific knowledge that the SPF
      result is not definitive for that\n   domain under those circumstances (for
      example, a message that is also\n   signed using DKIM [RFC6376] by the same
      domain, and that signature\n   validates).\n"
    title: 5.2.  When to Generate Reports
  - contents:
    - "5.3.  Where to Send Reports\n   Rather than generating feedback reports themselves,
      MUAs SHOULD\n   create abuse reports and send these reports back to their Mailbox\n
      \  Providers so that they can generate and send ARF messages on behalf\n   of
      end users (see Section 3.2 of [RFC6449]).  This allows centralized\n   processing
      and tracking of reports, and provides training input to\n   filtering systems.
      \ There is, however, no standard mechanism for this\n   signaling between MUAs
      and Mailbox Providers to trigger abuse\n   reports.\n   Feedback Providers SHOULD
      NOT send reports to recipients that are\n   uninvolved or only peripherally
      involved.  For example, they SHOULD\n   NOT send reports to the operator of
      every Autonomous System in the\n   path between the apparent originating system
      and the operator\n   generating the report.  Instead, they need to send reports
      to\n   recipients that are both responsible for the messages and able to do\n
      \  something about them.\n   Deciding where to send an unsolicited report will
      typically rely on\n   heuristics.  Abuse addresses in WHOIS [RFC3912] records
      of the IP\n   address relaying the subject message and/or of the domain name
      found\n   in the results of a PTR (\"reverse lookup\") query on that address
      are\n   likely reasonable candidates, as is the abuse@domain role address\n
      \  (see [RFC2142]) of related domains.  Unsolicited reports SHOULD NOT\n   be
      sent to email addresses that are not clearly intended to handle\n   abuse reports.
      \ Legitimate candidates include those found in WHOIS\n   records or on a web
      site that either are explicitly described as an\n   abuse contact or are of
      the form \"abuse@domain\".\n   Where an abusive message is authenticated using
      a domain-level\n   authentication technology such as DKIM [RFC6376] or SPF [RFC4408],\n
      \  the domain that has been verified by the authentication mechanism is\n   often
      a reasonable candidate for receiving feedback about the\n   message.  For DKIM,
      though, while the authenticated domain has some\n   responsibility for the mail
      sent, it can be a poor contact point for\n   abuse issues (for example, it could
      represent the message's author\n   but not its sender, it could identify the
      bad actor responsible for\n   the message, or it could refer to a domain that
      cannot receive mail\n   at all).\n   Often, unsolicited reports will have no
      meaning if sent to abuse\n   reporting addresses belonging to the abusive parties
      themselves.  In\n   fact, it is possible that such reports might reveal information
      about\n   complainants.  Reports SHOULD NOT be sent to such addresses if they\n
      \  can be identified beforehand, except where the abusive party is known\n   to
      be responsive to such reports.\n"
    title: 5.3.  Where to Send Reports
  - contents:
    - "5.4.  What to Put in Reports\n   Reports SHOULD use \"Feedback-Type: abuse\"
      but can use other types as\n   appropriate.  However, the Mailbox Provider generating
      the reports\n   cannot assume that the operator receiving the reports will treat\n
      \  different Feedback-Types differently.\n   Reports SHOULD include the following
      optional fields whenever their\n   corresponding values are available and applicable
      to the report:\n   Original-Mail-From, Arrival-Date, Source-IP, and Original-Rcpt-To.\n
      \  Other optional fields can be included as deemed appropriate by the\n   implementer.\n
      \  Experience suggests that the use of ARF is advisable in most\n   contexts.
      \ Automated recipient systems can handle abuse reports sent\n   in ARF at least
      as well as any other format such as plain text, with\n   or without a copy of
      the message attached.  That holds even for\n   systems that did not request
      ARF reports, assuming such reports are\n   generated considering the possibility
      of recipients that don't use\n   automated ARF parsing.  Anyone sending unsolicited
      reports in ARF can\n   legitimately presume that some recipients will only be
      able to access\n   the human-readable (first, text/plain) part of it and SHOULD
      include\n   all information needed also in this part.  Further, they SHOULD\n
      \  ensure that the report is readable when viewed as plain text, to give\n   low-end
      ticketing systems as much assistance as possible.  In extreme\n   cases, failure
      to take these steps may result in the report being\n   discarded or ignored.\n"
    title: 5.4.  What to Put in Reports
  - contents:
    - "5.5.  What to Do with Reports\n   Receivers of unsolicited reports can take
      advantage of the\n   standardized parts of ARF to automate processing.  Independent
      of the\n   sender of the report, they can improve processing by separating valid\n
      \  reports from invalid reports by, for example, looking for references\n   to
      IP address ranges, domains, and mailboxes for which the recipient\n   organization
      is responsible in the copy of the reported message, and\n   by correlating multiple
      reports of similar messages to identify bulk\n   email senders.\n   Per Section
      4.4 of [RFC6449], a network service provider MAY use ARF\n   data for automated
      forwarding of feedback messages to the originating\n   customer.\n   Published
      abuse mailbox addresses SHOULD NOT reject non-ARF messages\n   based solely
      on the format, as generation of ARF messages can\n   occasionally be unavailable
      or not applicable.  Deviation from this\n   requirement could be done due to
      local policy decisions regarding\n   other message criteria.\n   Although [RFC6449]
      suggests that replying to feedback is not useful,\n   in the case of receipt
      of ARF reports where no feedback arrangement\n   has been established, a non-automated
      reply might be desirable to\n   indicate what action resulted from the complaint,
      heading off more\n   severe filtering by the Feedback Provider.  In addition,
      using an\n   address that cannot receive replies precludes any requests for\n
      \  additional information and increases the likelihood that further\n   reports
      will be discarded or blocked.  Thus, a Feedback Provider\n   sending unsolicited
      reports SHOULD NOT generate reports for which a\n   reply cannot be received.
      \ Where an unsolicited report results in the\n   establishment of contact with
      a responsible and responsive party,\n   this data can be saved for future complaint
      handling and possible\n   establishment of a formal (solicited) feedback arrangement.
      \ See\n   Section 3.5 of [RFC6449] for a discussion of establishment of\n   feedback
      arrangements.\n"

  - "6.  Generating Automatic Authentication Failure Reports\n   There are some cases
    where report generation is caused by automation\n   rather than user requests.
    \ A specific example of this is reporting,\n   using ARF (or extensions to it),
    of messages that fail particular\n   message authentication checks.  Examples
    of this include [RFC6651]\n   and [RFC6652].  The considerations presented below
    apply in those\n   cases.\n   The applicability statement for this use case is
    somewhat smaller, as\n   many of the issues associated with abuse reports are
    not relevant to\n   reports about authentication failures.\n   Automatic feedback
    generators MUST select actual message recipients\n   based on data provided by
    willing report receivers.  In particular,\n   recipients MUST NOT be selected
    using heuristics.\n   If the message under evaluation by the Verifier is an ARF
    [RFC5965]\n   message, a report MUST NOT be automatically generated.\n   The message
    for a new report sent via SMTP MUST be constructed so as\n   to avoid amplification
    attacks, deliberate or otherwise.  The\n   envelope sender address of the report
    MUST be chosen so that these\n   reports will not generate mail loops.  Similar
    to Section 2 of\n   [RFC3464], the envelope sender address of the report MUST
    be chosen\n   to ensure that no feedback reports will be issued in response to
    the\n   report itself.  Therefore, when an SMTP transaction is used to send a\n
    \  report, the MAIL FROM command SHOULD use the NULL reverse-path, i.e.,\n   \"MAIL
    FROM:<>\".  An exception to this would be the use of a reverse-\n   path selected
    such that SPF checks on the report will pass; in such\n   cases, the operator
    will need to make provisions to avoid the\n   amplification attack or mail loop
    via other means.\n   Reports SHOULD use \"Feedback-Type: auth-failure\" but MAY
    use other\n   types as appropriate.  However, the Mailbox Provider generating
    the\n   reports cannot assume that the operator receiving the reports will\n   treat
    different Feedback-Types differently.\n   These reports SHOULD include the following
    fields, although they are\n   optional in [RFC5965], whenever their corresponding
    values are\n   available: Original-Mail-From, Arrival-Date, Source-IP, and\n   Original-Rcpt-To.

    - "7.2.  Forgeries\n   Feedback Providers that relay user complaints directly,
      rather than\n   by reference to a stored message (e.g., IMAP or POP), could
      be duped\n   into sending a complaint about a message that the complaining user\n
      \  never actually received, as an attack on the purported originator of\n   the
      falsified message.  Feedback Providers need to be resilient to\n   such attack
      methods.\n   Also, these reports may be forged as easily as ordinary Internet\n
      \  electronic mail.  User agents and automatic mail handling facilities\n   (such
      as mail distribution list exploders) that wish to make\n   automatic use of
      reports of any kind should take appropriate\n   precautions to minimize the
      potential damage from denial-of-service\n   attacks.\n   Perhaps the simplest
      means of mitigating this threat is to assert\n   that these reports should themselves
      be signed with something like\n   DKIM and/or authorized by something like SPF.
      \ Note, however, that if\n   there is a problem with the email infrastructure
      at either end, DKIM\n   and/or SPF may result in reports that aren't trusted
      or even accepted\n   by their intended recipients, so it is important to make
      sure those\n   components are properly configured.  The use of both technologies
      in\n   tandem can resolve this concern to a degree, since they generally\n   have
      disjoint failure modes.\n"

    - "7.4.  Automatic Generation\n   ARF [RFC5965] reports have historically been
      generated individually\n   as a result of some kind of human request, such as
      someone clicking a\n   \"Report Abuse\" button in a mail reader.  In contrast,
      the mechanisms\n   described in some extension documents (i.e., [RFC6651] and
      [RFC6652])\n   are focused around automated reporting.  This obviously implies
      the\n   potential for much larger volumes or higher frequency of messages,\n
      \  and thus greater mail system load (both for Feedback Providers and\n   report
      receivers).\n   Those mechanisms are primarily intended for use in generating
      reports\n   to aid implementers of DKIM [RFC6376], Author Domain Signing\n   Practices
      (ADSP) [RFC5617], and SPF [RFC4408], and other related\n   protocols during
      development and debugging.  They are not generally\n   intended for prolonged
      forensic use, specifically because of these\n   load concerns.  However, extended
      use is possible by ADministrative\n   Management Domains (ADMDs) that want to
      keep a close watch for fraud\n   or infrastructure problems.  It is important
      to consider the impact\n   of doing so on both Feedback Providers and the requesting
      ADMDs.\n   A sender requesting these reports can cause its mail servers to be\n
      \  overwhelmed if it sends out signed messages whose signatures fail to\n   verify
      for some reason, provoking a large number of reports from\n   Feedback Providers.
      \ Similarly, a Feedback Provider could be\n   overwhelmed by a large volume
      of messages requesting reports whose\n   signatures fail to validate, as the
      Feedback Provider now needs to\n   send reports back to the Signer.\n   Limiting
      the rate of generation of these messages may be appropriate\n   but threatens
      to inhibit the distribution of important and possibly\n   time-sensitive information.\n
      \  In general ARF feedback loop terms, it is often suggested that\n   Feedback
      Providers only create these (or any) ARF reports after an\n   out-of-band arrangement
      has been made between two parties.  These\n   extension mechanisms provide ways
      to adjust parameters of an\n   authorized abuse report feedback loop that is
      configured and\n   activated by private agreement.  The alternative (sending
      reports\n   automatically based solely on data found in the messages) may have\n
      \  unintended consequences.\n"

    - "7.5.  Reporting Multiple Incidents\n   If it is known that a particular host
      generates abuse reports upon\n   certain incidents, an attacker could forge
      a high volume of messages\n   that will trigger such a report.  The recipient
      of the report could\n   then be inundated with reports.  This could easily be
      extended to a\n   distributed denial-of-service attack by finding a number of
      report-\n   generating servers.\n   The incident count referenced in ARF [RFC5965]
      provides a limited\n   form of mitigation.  The host that generates reports
      can elect to\n   send reports only periodically, with each report representing
      a\n   number of identical or nearly identical incidents.  One might even do\n
      \  something inverse-exponentially, sending reports for each of the\n   first
      ten incidents, then every tenth incident up to 100, then every\n   100th incident
      up to 1000, etc., until some period of relative quiet\n   after which the limitation
      resets.\n   The use of this technique for \"nearly identical\" incidents in\n
      \  particular causes a degradation in reporting quality, however.  If\n   for
      example a large number of pieces of spam arrive from one\n   attacker, a reporting
      agent could decide only to send a report about\n   a fraction of those messages.
      \ While this averts a flood of reports\n   to a system administrator, the precise
      details of each incident are\n   similarly not sent.\n   Other rate-limiting
      provisions might be considered, such as detecting\n   a temporary failure response
      from the report destination and thus\n   halting report generation to that destination
      for some period, or\n   simply imposing or negotiating a hard limit on the number
      of reports\n   to be sent to a particular receiver in a given time frame.\n"
