  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies a new iCalendar (RFC 5545) component that\n\
    \   allows the publication of available and unavailable time periods\n   associated\
    \ with a calendar user.  This component can be used in\n   standard iCalendar\
    \ free-busy lookups, including the iCalendar\n   Transport-independent Interoperability\
    \ Protocol (iTIP; RFC 5546)\n   free-busy requests, to generate repeating blocks\
    \ of available or busy\n   time with exceptions as needed.\n   This document also\
    \ defines extensions to the Calendaring Extensions\n   to WebDAV (CalDAV) calendar\
    \ access protocol (RFC 4791) and the\n   associated scheduling protocol (RFC 6638)\
    \ to specify how this new\n   calendar component can be used when evaluating free-busy\
    \ time.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Calendar users often have regular periods of time when they\
    \ are\n   either available to be scheduled or always unavailable.  For example,\n\
    \   an office worker will often wish only to appear free to their work\n   colleagues\
    \ during normal 'office hours' (e.g., Monday through Friday,\n   9 am through\
    \ 5 pm).  Or, a university professor might only be\n   available to students during\
    \ a set period of time (e.g., Thursday\n   afternoons, 2 pm through 5 pm during\
    \ term time only).  Ideally, users\n   ought be able to specify such periods directly\
    \ via their calendar\n   user agent and have them automatically considered as\
    \ part of the\n   normal free-busy lookup for that user.  In addition, it ought\
    \ be\n   possible to present different periods of available time depending on\n\
    \   which user is making the request.\n   iCalendar [RFC5545] defines a \"VFREEBUSY\"\
    \ component that can be used\n   to represent fixed busy time periods, but it\
    \ does not provide a way\n   to specify a repeating period of available or unavailable\
    \ time.\n   Since repeating patterns are often the case, \"VFREEBUSY\" components\n\
    \   are not sufficient to solve this problem.\n   This specification defines a\
    \ new type of iCalendar component that can\n   be used to publish user availability.\n\
    \   CalDAV [RFC4791] provides a way for calendar users to access and\n   manage\
    \ calendar data and exchange this data via scheduling\n   operations.  As part\
    \ of this, the CalDAV calendar-access [RFC4791]\n   feature provides a CALDAV:free-busy-query\
    \ REPORT that returns free-\n   busy information for a calendar collection or\
    \ hierarchy of calendar\n   collections.  Also, the CalDAV calendar-auto-schedule\
    \ [RFC6638]\n   feature allows free-busy information for a calendar user to be\n\
    \   determined.  Both of these operations involve examining user\n   calendars\
    \ for events that 'block time', with the blocked out periods\n   being returned\
    \ in a \"VFREEBUSY\" component.\n   This specification extends the CalDAV calendar-access\
    \ and CalDAV\n   calendar-auto-schedule features to allow the new iCalendar\n\
    \   availability components to be stored and manipulated and to allow\n   free-busy\
    \ lookups to use the information from any such components, if\n   present.\n"

  - "3.  iCalendar Extensions\n   This specification adds a new \"VAVAILABILITY\"\
    \ calendar component to\n   iCalendar.  The \"VAVAILABILITY\" component is itself\
    \ a container for\n   new \"AVAILABLE\" subcomponents.\n   The purpose of the\
    \ \"VAVAILABILITY\" calendar component is to provide a\n   grouping of available\
    \ time information over a specific range of time.\n   Within that, there are specific\
    \ time ranges that are marked as\n   available via a set of \"AVAILABLE\" calendar\
    \ subcomponents.  Together\n   these can be used to specify available time that\
    \ can repeat over set\n   periods of time, and which can vary over time.\n   An\
    \ illustration of how \"VAVAILABILITY\" and \"AVAILABLE\" components\n   work\
    \ is shown below.\n                         Time Range\n   <=========================================================>\n\

    \        <----->              <-----------> Busy Time\n   The overall time range\
    \ is shown at the top.  A \"VAVAILABILITY\"\n   component spans part of the range.\
    \  The time range covered by the\n   \"VAVAILABILITY\" component is considered\
    \ to be busy, except for the\n   ranges covered by the \"AVAILABLE\" components\
    \ within the\n   \"VAVAILABILITY\" component.\n"

    \ indicates a period of time\n      within which availability information is provided.\
    \  A\n      \"VAVAILABILITY\" component can specify a start time and an end time\n\
    \      or duration.  If \"DTSTART\" is not present, then the start time is\n \
    \     unbounded.  If \"DTEND\" or \"DURATION\" are not present, then the end\n\
    \      time is unbounded.  Within the specified time period, availability\n  \
    \    defaults to a free-busy type of \"BUSY-UNAVAILABLE\" (see\n      Section\
    \ 3.2), except for any time periods corresponding to\n      \"AVAILABLE\" subcomponents.\n\
    \      \"AVAILABLE\" subcomponents are used to indicate periods of free\n    \
    \  time within the time range of the enclosing \"VAVAILABILITY\"\n      component.\
    \  \"AVAILABLE\" subcomponents MAY include recurrence\n      properties to specify\
    \ recurring periods of time, which can be\n      overridden using normal iCalendar\
    \ recurrence behavior (i.e., use\n      of the \"RECURRENCE-ID\" property).\n\
    \      If specified, the \"DTSTART\" and \"DTEND\" properties in\n      \"VAVAILABILITY\"\
    \ components and \"AVAILABLE\" subcomponents MUST be\n      \"DATE-TIME\" values\
    \ specified as either the date with UTC time or\n      the date with local time\
    \ and a time zone reference.\n      The iCalendar object containing the \"VAVAILABILITY\"\
    \ component MUST\n      contain appropriate \"VTIMEZONE\" components corresponding\
    \ to each\n      unique \"TZID\" parameter value used in any DATE-TIME properties\
    \ in\n      all components, unless [RFC7809] is in effect.\n      When used to\
    \ publish available time, the \"ORGANIZER\" property\n      specifies the calendar\
    \ user associated with the published\n      available time.\n      If the \"PRIORITY\"\
    \ property is specified in \"VAVAILABILITY\"\n      components, it is used to\
    \ determine how that component is combined\n      with other \"VAVAILABILITY\"\
    \ components.  See Section 4.\n      Other calendar properties MAY be specified\
    \ in \"VAVAILABILITY\" or\n      \"AVAILABLE\" components and are considered attributes\
    \ of the marked\n      block of time.  Their usage is application specific.  For\
    \ example,\n      the \"LOCATION\" property might be used to indicate that a person\
    \ is\n      available in one location for part of the week and a different\n \
    \     location for another part of the week (but see Section 9 for when\n    \
    \  it is appropriate to add additional data like this).\n   Example:  The following\
    \ is an example of a \"VAVAILABILITY\" calendar\n      component used to represent\

- title: 4.  Combining VAVAILABILITY Components
  contents:
  - "4.  Combining VAVAILABILITY Components\n   The \"VAVAILABILITY\" component allows\
    \ a calendar user to describe\n   their availability over extended periods of\
    \ time through the use of\n   recurrence patterns.  This availability might be\
    \ relatively constant\n   from year to year.\n   However, there is usually some\
    \ degree of irregularity, as people take\n   vacations or perhaps spend a few\
    \ weeks at a different office.  For\n   that period of time there is a need to\
    \ redefine their availability.\n   Rather than modify their existing availability,\
    \ the \"PRIORITY\"\n   property allows new \"VAVAILABILITY\" components to override\
    \ others of\n   lower ordinal priority.  Note that iCalendar [RFC5545] defines\
    \ the\n   \"PRIORITY\" property such that a value of 0 is undefined, 1 is the\n\
    \   highest priority, and 9 is the lowest.\n   When combining \"VAVAILABILITY\"\
    \ components, an absence of a \"PRIORITY\"\n   property or a value of 0 implies\
    \ the lowest level of priority.  When\n   two or more VAVAILABILITY components\
    \ overlap, and they have the same\n   PRIORITY value, the overlapping busy time\
    \ type is determined by the\n   following order: BUSY > BUSY-UNAVAILABLE > BUSY-TENTATIVE.\
    \  That is,\n   if one component has a BUSYTYPE set to BUSY and the other has\n\
    \   BUSYTYPE set to BUSY-UNAVAILABLE, then the effective busy time type\n   over\
    \ the time range that they overlap would be BUSY.  It is up to the\n   creator\
    \ of such components to ensure that combining them produces a\n   consistent and\
    \ expected result.\n   To calculate the available time, order the intersecting\n\
    \   \"VAVAILABILITY\" components by priority (the lowest to highest\n   \"PRIORITY\"\
    \ values are 0, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1).\n   Step through the resulting list\
    \ of \"VAVAILABILITY\" components.  For\n   each, the time range covered by the\
    \ \"VAVAILABILITY\" component is set\n   to busy and then portions of it defined\
    \ by the \"AVAILABLE\" components\n   in the \"VAVAILABILITY\" component are set\
    \ to free.\n   Note that, if any \"VAVAILABILITY\" component completely covers\
    \ the\n   date range of interest, then any lower priority \"VAVAILABILITY\"\n\
    \   components can be ignored.\n   Typically, a calendar user's \"default\" availability\
    \ (e.g., business\n   hours of Monday through Friday, 9:00 am to 5:00 pm) would\
    \ use the\n   lowest level of priority: zero.  Any overrides to the \"default\"\
    \ would\n   use higher levels as needed.  To avoid having to keep readjusting\
    \ the\n   \"PRIORITY\" property value when an override has to be \"inserted\"\n\
    \   between two existing components, priority values SHOULD be \"spaced\n   out\"\
    \ over the full range of values.  The table below illustrates this\n   via an\
    \ example.  The first row shows the priority range from low to\n   high, the second\
    \ row shows the corresponding \"PRIORITY\" property\n   value, and the third row\
    \ shows which \"VAVAILABILITY\" component has\n   that priority.  The \"default\"\
    \ availability is created with priority\n   zero (shown as {a} in the table),\
    \ then the first override created\n   with priority 5 (shown as {b} in the table),\
    \ a subsequent\n   availability can be inserted between the two by using priority\
    \ 7\n   (shown as {c} in the table), and another, taking precedence over all\n\
    \   existing ones, with priority 3 (shown as {d} in the table).  As seen\n   in\
    \ the table, additional \"slots\" are open for more \"VAVAILABILITY\"\n   components\
    \ to be added with other priorities if needed.\n            +-----+----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+------+\n\

  - "5.  Calculating Free-Busy Time\n   This section describes how free-busy time\
    \ information for a calendar\n   user is calculated in the presence of \"VAVAILABILITY\"\
    \ calendar\n   components.\n   An iCalendar \"VFREEBUSY\" component is used to\
    \ convey \"rolled-up\"\n   free-busy time information for a calendar user.  This\
    \ can be\n   generated as the result of an iTIP [RFC5546] free-busy request or\n\
    \   through some other mechanism (e.g., a CalDAV calendar-access\n   CALDAV:free-busy-query\
    \ REPORT).\n   When one or more \"VAVAILABILITY\" components are present and intersect\n\
    \   the time range for the free-busy request, first the available time is\n  \
    \ calculated, as outlined in Section 4.  Once that is done, regular\n   \"VEVENT\"\
    \ and \"VFREEBUSY\" components can be \"overlaid\" in the usual\n   way to block\
    \ out time.\n   An example procedure for this is as follows:\n   1.  Initially\
    \ mark the entire period of the free-busy request as\n       free.\n   2.  For\
    \ each \"VAVAILABILITY\" component ordered by PRIORITY (lowest to\n       highest):\n\
    \       A.  Determine if the \"VAVAILABILITY\" intersects the time range of\n\
    \           the free-busy request.  If not, ignore it.\n       B.  Determine if\
    \ the \"VAVAILABILITY\" is completely overridden by\n           a higher priority\
    \ component.  If so, ignore it.\n       C.  For the time period covered by the\
    \ \"VAVAILABILITY\" component,\n           mark time in the free-busy request\
    \ result set as busy, using\n           the busy time type derived from the \"\
    BUSYTYPE\" property in\n           the \"VAVAILABILITY\" component.\n       D.\
    \  Append the \"VAVAILABILITY\" component to a list of components\n          \
    \ for further processing in step 3, if it has not been ignored.\n   3.  For each\
    \ \"VAVAILABILITY\" component in the list resulting from\n       step 2, in order\
    \ from the first item to the last item:\n       A.  For each \"AVAILABLE\" component\
    \ in the \"VAVAILABILITY\"\n           component:\n           i.    Expand all\
    \ recurring instances, taking into account\n                 overridden instances,\
    \ ignoring instances or parts of\n                 instances that fall outside\

    \ by the\n                 \"VAVAILABILITY\" component.\n           ii.   For\
    \ each instance, mark the corresponding time in the\n                 free-busy\
    \ request result set as free.\n   4.  For each \"VEVENT\" or \"VFREEBUSY\" component,\

  contents:
  - "7.2.5.  iTIP Free-Busy Requests\n   The CalDAV calendar-auto-schedule feature\
    \ (see Section 5 of\n   [RFC6638]) includes a mechanism for free-busy information\
    \ to be\n   requested via the CalDAV protocol.  Any \"VAVAILABILITY\" components\
    \ in\n   any calendar collections targeted during such a request MUST be\n   included\
    \ as part of the calculation of the overall free-busy\n   information.  In addition,\
    \ the \"VAVAILABILITY\" component specified in\n   the CALDAV:calendar-availability\
    \ property on the owner's Inbox MUST\n   also be included in the free-busy calculation.\
    \  Processing of all\n   such \"VAVAILABILITY\" components is done as per Section\
    \ 5.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   Calculation of availability information, particularly\
    \ with multiple\n   overlapping time ranges, can be complex, and CalDAV servers\
    \ MUST\n   limit the complexity of such data stored by a client.\n   An attacker\
    \ able to \"inject\" availability information into a calendar\n   user's calendar\
    \ data could ensure that the user never appears free\n   for meetings or appears\
    \ free at inappropriate times.  Calendar\n   systems MUST ensure that availability\
    \ information for a calendar user\n   can only be modified by authorized users.\n\
    \   Security considerations in [RFC5545], [RFC5546], [RFC4791],\n   [RFC6638],\
    \ and [RFC7809] MUST also be adhered to.\n"
- title: 9.  Privacy Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Privacy Considerations\n   Free-busy and availability information can be\
    \ used by attackers to\n   infer the whereabouts or overall level of \"activity\"\
    \ of the\n   corresponding calendar user.  Any calendar system that allows a user\n\
    \   to expose their free-busy and availability information MUST limit\n   access\
    \ to that information to only authorized users.\n   When \"VAVAILABILITY\" components\
    \ are sent to or shared with other\n   calendar users, care has to be taken not\
    \ to expose more information\n   than is needed by each recipient.  For example,\
    \ a business owner will\n   likely not want their customers to know where they\
    \ might be or what\n   they might be doing, but family members might be willing\
    \ to expose\n   such information to each other.  Thus, calendaring systems allowing\n\
    \   \"VAVAILABILITY\" components to be sent or shared to other calendar\n   users\
    \ MUST provide a way for nonessential properties to be removed\n   (e.g., \"SUMMARY\"\
    , \"LOCATION\", and \"DESCRIPTION\").\n   iCalendar \"VFREEBUSY\" information\
    \ generated from \"VAVAILABILITY\"\n   components MUST NOT include information\
    \ other than busy or free time\n   periods.  In particular, user specified property\
    \ values such as\n   \"SUMMARY\", \"LOCATION\", and \"DESCRIPTION\" MUST NOT be\
    \ copied into the\n   free-busy result data.\n   Privacy considerations in [RFC5545],\
    \ [RFC5546], [RFC4791], [RFC6638],\n   and [RFC7809] MUST also be adhered to.\n"
