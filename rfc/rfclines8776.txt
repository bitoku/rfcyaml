Abstract This document defines a collection of common data types and groupings in YANG data modeling language.
These derived common types and groupings are intended to be imported by modules that model Traffic Engineering (TE) configuration and state capabilities.
[RFC7950] is a data modeling language used to model configuration data, state data, Remote Procedure Calls, and notifications for network management protocols such as the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC6241].
The YANG language supports a small set of built in data types and provides mechanisms to derive other types from the built in types.
This document introduces a collection of common data types derived from the built in YANG data types.
The derived types and groupings are designed to be the common types applicable for modeling Traffic Engineering (TE) features in model(s) defined outside of this document.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in [RFC7950].
Prefixes in Data Node Names
In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the corresponding YANG imported modules, as shown in Table 1.

This document defines two YANG modules for common TE types: "ietf te types" for TE generic types and "ietf te packet types" for packet specific types.
Other technology specific TE types are outside the scope of this document.
The "ietf te types" module (Section 4) contains common TE types that are independent and agnostic of any specific technology or control  plane instance.
The "ietf te types" module contains the following YANG reusable types and groupings:
A YANG grouping that defines the generic TE bandwidth.
The modeling structure allows augmentation for each technology.
For unspecified technologies, the string encoded "te bandwidth" type is used.
A YANG grouping that defines the generic TE label.
The modeling structure allows augmentation for each technology.
For unspecified technologies, "rt types:generalized label" is used.
A YANG grouping that defines one way and two way measured Performance Metrics (PM) and indications of anomalies on link(s) or the path as defined in [RFC7471], [RFC8570], and [RFC7823].
A YANG grouping that defines configurable thresholds for advertisement suppression and measurement intervals.
te ds class: A type representing the Differentiated Services (DS) Class Type of traffic as defined in [RFC4124].
te label direction: An enumerated type for specifying the forward or reverse direction of a label.
An enumerated type for specifying that a hop is loose or strict.
A type representing the identifier that uniquely identifies an operator, which can be either a provider or a client.
The definition of this type is taken from [RFC6370] and [RFC5003].
This attribute type is used solely to provide a globally unique context for TE topologies.
A type representing the identifier for a node in a TE topology.
The identifier is represented as 4 octets in dotted quad notation.
This attribute MAY be mapped to the Router Address TLV described in Section 2.4.1 of [RFC3630], the TE Router ID described in Section 3 of [RFC6827], the Traffic Engineering Router ID TLV described in Section 4.3 of [RFC5305], or the TE Router ID TLV described in Section 3.2.1 of [RFC6119].
The reachability of such a TE node MAY be achieved by a mechanism such as that described in Section 6.2 of [RFC6827].
A type representing the identifier for a topology.
It is optional to have one or more prefixes at the beginning, separated by colons.
The prefixes can be "network types" as defined in the "ietf network" module in [RFC8345], to help the user better understand the topology before further inquiry is made.
A type representing the identifier of a TE interface Link Termination Point (LTP) on a specific TE node where the TE link connects.
This attribute is mapped to a local or remote link identifier
A type representing the different resource disjointness options for a TE tunnel path as defined in [RFC4872].
A union type for a TE link's classic or extended administrative groups as defined in [RFC3630], [RFC5305], and [RFC7308].
A type representing the Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) as defined in [RFC4203] and [RFC5307].

A base YANG identity for supported TE tunnel types as defined in [RFC3209] and [RFC4875].
A base YANG identity for supported LSP encoding types as defined in [RFC3471].

Packet TE Types Module Contents
The "ietf te packet types" module (Section 5) covers the common types and groupings that are specific to packet technology.
The "ietf te packet types"
module contains the following YANG reusable types and groupings: backup protection type:

te bandwidth requested type: An enumerated type for the different options to request bandwidth for a specific tunnel.
A YANG grouping that contains the generic performance metrics and additional packet specific metrics.
In addition to [RFC6991] and [RFC8294], this module references the following documents in defining the types and YANG groupings: [RFC3272], [RFC4090], [RFC4202], [RFC4328], [RFC4561], [RFC4657], [RFC5817], [RFC6004], [RFC6511], [RFC7139], [RFC7308], [RFC7551], [RFC7571], [RFC7579], and [G.709].

This document registers two YANG modules in the "YANG Module Names" registry [RFC6020].
Name:  ietf te packet types
yang:ietf te packet types Prefix:  te packet types
The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].
The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory to implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].
The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory to implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].
The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM)
[RFC8341] provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.
The YANG module in this document defines common TE type definitions (e.g., typedef, identity, and grouping statements) in YANG data modeling language to be imported and used by other TE modules.
When imported and used, the resultant schema will have data nodes that can be writable or readable.
Access to such data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
Write operations (e.g., edit config) to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
The security considerations spelled out in the YANG 1.1 specification [RFC7950] apply for this document as well.
