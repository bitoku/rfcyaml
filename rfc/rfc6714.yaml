  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) [RFC4975] expects\
    \ to use\n   MSRP relays [RFC4976] as a means for Network Address Translation\n\
    \   (NAT) traversal and policy enforcement.  However, many Session\n   Initiation\
    \ Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] networks, which deploy MSRP,\n   contain middleboxes.\
    \  These middleboxes anchor and control media;\n   perform tasks such as NAT traversal,\
    \ performance monitoring, and\n   address domain bridging; interconnect Service\
    \ Level Agreement (SLA)\n   policy enforcement; and so on.  One example is the\
    \ Interconnection\n   Border Control Function (IBCF) [GPP23228], defined by the\
    \ 3rd\n   Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).  The IBCF controls a media\n\
    \   relay that handles all types of SIP session media, such as voice,\n   video,\
    \ MSRP, etc.\n   MSRP, as defined in RFC 4975 [RFC4975] and RFC 4976 [RFC4976],\
    \ cannot\n   anchor through middleboxes.  The reason is that MSRP messages have\n\
    \   routing information embedded in the message.  Without an extension\n   such\
    \ as CEMA, middleboxes must read the message to change the routing\n   information.\
    \  This occurs because middleboxes modify the address:port\n   information in\
    \ the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566]\n   c/m-line in order to anchor\
    \ media.  An \"active\" [RFC6135] MSRP User\n   Agent (UA) establishes the MSRP\
    \ TCP or Transport Layer Security (TLS)\n   connection based on the MSRP URI of\
    \ the SDP 'path' attribute.  This\n   means that the MSRP connection will not\
    \ be routed through the\n   middlebox unless the middlebox also modifies the MSRP\
    \ URI of the\n   topmost SDP 'path' attribute.  In many scenarios, this will prevent\n\
    \   the MSRP connection from being established.  In addition, if the\n   middlebox\
    \ modifies the MSRP URI of the SDP 'path' attribute, then the\n   MSRP URI comparison\
    \ procedure [RFC4975], which requires consistency\n   between the address information\
    \ in the MSRP messages and the address\n   information carried in the MSRP URI\
    \ of the SDP 'path' attribute,\n   will fail.\n   The only way to achieve interoperability\
    \ in this situation is for the\n   middlebox to act as an MSRP back-to-back User\
    \ Agent (B2BUA).  Here,\n   the MSRP B2BUA acts as the endpoint for the MSRP signaling\
    \ and media,\n   performs the corresponding modification in the associated MSRP\n\
    \   messages, and originates a new MSRP session toward the actual remote\n   endpoint.\
    \  However, the enabling of MSRP B2BUA functionality requires\n   substantially\
    \ more resource usage in the middlebox, which normally\n   results in a negative\
    \ impact on performance.  In addition, the MSRP\n   message needs to be exposed\
    \ in cleartext to the MSRP B2BUA, which\n   violates the end-to-end principle\
    \ [RFC3724].\n   This specification defines an MSRP extension, Connection\n  \
    \ Establishment for Media Anchoring (CEMA).  In most cases, CEMA allows\n   MSRP\
    \ endpoints to communicate through middleboxes as defined in\n   Section 2, without\
    \ a need for the middleboxes to be MSRP B2BUAs.  In\n   such cases, middleboxes\
    \ that want to anchor the MSRP connection\n   simply modify the SDP c/m-line address\
    \ information, similar to what\n   the middleboxes do for non-MSRP media types.\
    \  MSRP endpoints that\n   support the CEMA extension will use the SDP c/m-line\
    \ address\n   information for establishing the TCP or TLS connection for sending\n\
    \   and receiving MSRP messages.\n   The CEMA extension is backward compatible,\
    \ meaning that CEMA-enabled\n   MSRP endpoints can communicate with non-CEMA-enabled\
    \ endpoints.  In\n   scenarios where MSRP endpoints do not support the CEMA extension,\
    \ an\n   MSRP endpoint that supports the CEMA extension behaves in the same\n\
    \   way as an MSRP endpoint that does not support it.  The CEMA extension\n  \
    \ only provides an alternative mechanism for negotiating and providing\n   address\
    \ information for the MSRP TCP connection.  After the creation\n   of the MSRP\
    \ connection, an MSRP endpoint that supports the CEMA\n   extension acts according\
    \ to the procedures for creating MSRP\n   messages, performing checks when receiving\
    \ MSRP messages defined in\n   RFC 4975 and, when it is using a relay for MSRP\
    \ communications,\n   RFC 4976.\n"

    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP\
    \ 14, RFC 2119\n   [RFC2119].\n   Definitions:\n   Fingerprint-Based TLS Authentication:\
    \  An MSRP endpoint that uses a\n      self-signed certificate and sends a fingerprint\
    \ (i.e., a hash of\n      the self-signed certificate) in SDP to the other MSRP\
    \ endpoint.\n      This fingerprint binds the TLS key exchange to the signaling\
    \ plane\n      and authenticates the other endpoint based on trust in the\n  \
    \    signaling plane.\n   Name-Based TLS Authentication:  An MSRP endpoint that\
    \ uses a\n      certificate that is bound to the endpoint's hostname or SIP\n\
    \      address of record.  In the TLS session setup, the other MSRP\n      endpoint\
    \ verifies that the identity associated with the\n      certificate corresponds\
    \ to that of the peer (as indicated in SIP/\n      SDP) and that the binding of\
    \ the identity to the public key was\n      done by a party that the endpoint\
    \ trusts.  This definition\n      includes traditional certificates issued by\
    \ a well-known\n      certification authority as well as self-signed certificates\n\
    \      published via the SIP Certificate Management Service [RFC6072] and\n  \
    \    other similar mechanisms.\n   B2BUA:  This is an abbreviation for back-to-back\
    \ user agent.\n   MSRP B2BUA:  A network element that terminates an MSRP connection\n\
    \      from one MSRP endpoint and reoriginates that connection toward\n      another\
    \ MSRP endpoint.  Note that the MSRP B2BUA is distinct from\n      a SIP B2BUA.\
    \  A SIP B2BUA terminates a SIP session and\n      reoriginates that session toward\
    \ another SIP endpoint.  In the\n      context of MSRP, a SIP endpoint initiates\
    \ a SIP session toward\n      another SIP endpoint.  However, that INVITE may\
    \ go through, for\n      example, an outbound proxy or inbound proxy to route\
    \ to the remote\n      SIP endpoint.  As part of that SIP session, an MSRP session\
    \ that\n      may follow the SIP session path is negotiated.  However, there is\n\
    \      no requirement to co-locate the SIP network elements with the MSRP\n  \
    \    network elements.\n   TLS B2BUA:  A network element that terminates security\
    \ associations\n      (SAs) from endpoints and establishes separate SAs between\
    \ itself\n      and each endpoint.\n   Middlebox:  A SIP network device that modifies\
    \ SDP media address:port\n      information in order to steer or anchor media\
    \ flows described in\n      the SDP, including TCP and TLS connections used for\
    \ MSRP\n      communication, through a media proxy function controlled by the\n\
    \      SIP endpoint.  In most cases, the media proxy function relays the\n   \
    \   MSRP messages without modification, while in some circumstances it\n     \
    \ acts as an MSRP B2BUA.  Other SIP-related functions -- such as\n      those\
    \ related to routing, modification of SIP information, etc. --\n      performed\
    \ by the Middlebox, and whether it acts as a SIP B2BUA or\n      not, are outside\
    \ the scope of this document.  Section 6 describes\n      additional assumptions\
    \ regarding how the Middlebox handles MSRP in\n      order to support the extension\
    \ defined in this document.\n   Media anchor:  An entity that performs media anchoring\
    \ inserts itself\n      in the media path of a media communication session between\
    \ two\n      entities.  The media anchor will receive, and forward, the media\n\
    \      sent between the entities.\n   This document reuses the terms \"answer\"\
    , \"answerer\", \"offer\", and\n   \"offerer\" as defined in [RFC3264].\n"

  - "3.  Applicability Statement\n   This document defines a Message Session Relay\
    \ Protocol (MSRP)\n   extension, Connection Establishment for Media Anchoring\
    \ (CEMA).\n   Support of this extension is OPTIONAL.  The extension allows\n \
    \  Middleboxes to anchor the MSRP connection, without the need for\n   Middleboxes\

    \ also defines a Session Description Protocol\n   (SDP) attribute, 'msrp-cema',\
    \ that MSRP endpoints use to indicate\n   support of the CEMA extension.\n   The\
    \ CEMA extension is primarily intended for MSRP endpoints that\n   operate in\

    \  An example of such a network is the\n   IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), defined\

    \ unless there is a gateway between these networks that by\n   default always\
    \ enables MSRP B2BUA functionality.\n   This document assumes certain behaviors\
    \ on the part of Middleboxes,\n   as described in Section 6.  These behaviors\
    \ are not standardized.  If\n   Middleboxes do not behave as assumed, then the\
    \ CEMA extension does\n   not add any value over base MSRP behavior.  MSRP endpoints\
    \ that\n   support CEMA are required to use RFC 4975 behavior in cases where\n\
    \   they detect that the CEMA extension cannot be enabled.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  General\n   This section defines how an MSRP endpoint that supports the\
    \ CEMA\n   extension generates SDP offers and answers for MSRP, and which SDP\n\
    \   information elements the MSRP endpoint uses when creating the TCP or\n   TLS\
    \ connection for sending and receiving MSRP messages.\n   Based on the procedures\
    \ described in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, in the\n   following cases the CEMA extension\
    \ will not be enabled, and there\n   will be a fallback to the MSRP connection\
    \ establishment procedures\n   defined in RFC 4975 and RFC 4976:\n   -  A non-CEMA-enabled\
    \ MSRP endpoint becomes \"active\" [RFC6135] (no\n      matter whether it uses\
    \ a relay for its MSRP communication or not),\n      as it will always establish\
    \ the MSRP connection using the SDP\n      'path' attribute, which contains the\
    \ address information of the\n      remote MSRP endpoint, instead of using the\

    \      MSRP message (in order for the relay to establish the MSRP\n      connection\
    \ toward the Middlebox), the session matching [RFC4975]\n      performed by the\

- title: 4.2.  MSRP SDP Offerer Procedures
  contents:
  - "4.2.  MSRP SDP Offerer Procedures\n   When a CEMA-enabled offerer sends an SDP\
    \ offer for MSRP, it generates\n   the SDP offer according to the procedures in\
    \ RFC 4975.  In addition,\n   the offerer follows RFC 4976 if it is using a relay\
    \ for MSRP\n   communication.  The offerer also performs the following additions\
    \ and\n   modifications:\n   1.  The offerer MUST include an SDP 'msrp-cema' attribute\
    \ in the MSRP\n       media description of the SDP offer.\n   2.  If the offerer\
    \ is not using a relay for MSRP communication, it\n       MUST include an SDP\
    \ 'setup' attribute in the MSRP media\n       description of the SDP offer, according\
    \ to the procedures in\n       RFC 6135 [RFC6135].\n   3.  If the offerer is using\
    \ a relay for MSRP communication, it MUST,\n       in addition to including the\
    \ address information of the relay in\n       the topmost SDP 'path' attribute,\
    \ also include the address\n       information of the relay, rather than its own\
    \ address\n       information, in the SDP c/m-line associated with the MSRP media\n\
    \       description.  In addition, it MUST include an SDP 'setup:actpass'\n  \
    \     attribute in the MSRP media description of the SDP offer.\n   When the offerer\
    \ receives an SDP answer, if the MSRP media\n   description of the SDP answer\
    \ does not contain an SDP 'msrp-cema'\n   attribute, and if any one or more of\
    \ the criteria below are met, the\n   offerer MUST fall back to RFC 4975 behavior\
    \ by sending a new SDP\n   offer according to the procedures in RFC 4975 and RFC\
    \ 4976.  The new\n   offer MUST NOT contain an SDP 'msrp-cema' attribute.\n  \
    \ 1.  The SDP c/m-line address information associated with the MSRP\n       media\
    \ description does not match (see Section 4.4) the\n       information in the\
    \ MSRP URI of the 'path' attribute(s) (in which\n       case it is assumed that\
    \ the SDP c/m-line contains the address of\n       a Middlebox), and the MSRP\
    \ endpoint will become \"passive\" (if the\n       MSRP media description of the\
    \ SDP answer contains an SDP 'setup:\n       active' attribute).\n   NOTE: If\
    \ an MSRP URI contains a domain name, it needs to be resolved\n   into an IP address\
    \ and port before it is checked against the SDP\n   c/m-line address information,\
    \ in order to determine whether the\n   address information matches.\n   2.  The\
    \ offerer uses a relay for its MSRP communication, the SDP\n       c/m-line address\
    \ information associated with the MSRP media\n       description does not match\
    \ the information in the MSRP URI of the\n       SDP 'path' attribute(s) (in which\
    \ case it is assumed that the SDP\n       c/m-line contains the address of a Middlebox),\
    \ and the offerer\n       will become \"active\" (either by default or if the\
    \ MSRP media\n       description of the SDP answer contains an SDP 'setup:passive'\n\
    \       attribute).\n   3.  The remote MSRP endpoint, acting as an answerer, uses\
    \ a relay for\n       its MSRP communication, the SDP c/m-line address information\n\
    \       associated with the MSRP media description does not match the\n      \
    \ information in the MSRP URI of the SDP 'path' attributes (in\n       which case\
    \ it is assumed that the SDP c/m-line contains the\n       address of a Middlebox),\
    \ and the MSRP offerer will become\n       \"active\" (either by default or if\
    \ the MSRP media description of\n       the SDP answer contains an SDP 'setup:passive'\
    \ attribute).\n   NOTE: As described in Section 6, in the absence of the SDP\n\
    \   'msrp-cema' attribute in the new offer, it is assumed that a\n   Middlebox\
    \ will act as an MSRP B2BUA in order to anchor MSRP media.\n   The offerer can\
    \ send the new offer within the existing early dialog\n   [RFC3261], or it can\
    \ terminate the early dialog and establish a new\n   dialog by sending the new\
    \ offer in a new initial INVITE request.\n   The offerer MAY choose to terminate\
    \ the session establishment if it\n   can detect that a Middlebox acting as an\
    \ MSRP B2BUA is not the\n   desired remote MSRP endpoint.\n   If the answerer\
    \ uses a relay for its MSRP communication, and the SDP\n   c/m-line address information\
    \ associated with the MSRP media\n   description matches one of the SDP 'path'\
    \ attributes, it is assumed\n   that there is no Middlebox in the network.  In\
    \ that case, the offerer\n   MUST fall back to RFC 4975 behavior, but it does\
    \ not need to send a\n   new SDP offer.\n   In other cases, where none of the\
    \ criteria above are met, and where\n   the MSRP offerer becomes \"active\", it\
    \ MUST use the SDP c/m-line for\n   establishing the MSRP TCP connection.  If\
    \ the offerer becomes\n   \"passive\", it will wait for the answerer to establish\
    \ the TCP\n   connection, according to the procedures in RFC 4975.\n"

    \   Middlebox is MSRP aware.  This means that it implements MSRP B2BUA\n   functionality.\
    \  The Middlebox enables that functionality in cases\n   where the offerer does\
    \ not support the CEMA extension.  In cases\n   where the SDP offer indicates\
    \ support of the CEMA extension, the\n   Middlebox can simply modify the SDP c/m-line\

    \ in SDP offers and\n   answers.\n   If the Middlebox does not implement MSRP\
    \ B2BUA functionality, or does\n   not enable it when the SDP 'msrp-cema' attribute\

  contents:
  - "7.1.  General\n   Unless otherwise stated, the security considerations in RFC\
    \ 4975 and\n   RFC 4976 still apply.  This section only describes additions and\n\
    \   changes introduced by the CEMA extension.\n   The purpose of CEMA is to enable\
    \ MSRP communication over Middleboxes.\n   These Middleboxes are commonly deployed\
    \ by SIP network operators, who\n   also commonly deploy firewall and routing\
    \ policies that prevent media\n   sessions from working unless they traverse the\
    \ Middleboxes.\n   CEMA makes it possible for Middleboxes to tunnel TLS to allow\
    \ end-to-\n   end SAs between endpoints.  This is an improvement over the status\n\
    \   quo, since without CEMA, the Middleboxes would be forced to both read\n  \
    \ and modify the cleartext MSRP messages, which would make end-to-end\n   confidentiality\
    \ and integrity protection of the MSRP transport\n   channel impossible.\n   RFC\
    \ 4975 suggests two ways for MSRP endpoints to verify that the TLS\n   connection\
    \ is established end to end.  The first option is to use\n   certificates from\
    \ a well-known certification authority and verify\n   that the SubjectAltName\
    \ matches the MSRP URI of the other side.  The\n   second option is to use self-signed\
    \ certificates and include a\n   fingerprint of the certificate in the SDP offer/answer.\
    \  Provided the\n   signaling is integrity protected, both endpoints can verify\
    \ that the\n   TLS SA is established with the correct host by matching the received\n\
    \   certificate against the received fingerprint.\n   Fingerprint-based authentication\
    \ is expected to be common for end\n   clients.  In order to ensure the integrity\
    \ of the fingerprint,\n   RFC 4975 recommends using the SIP Identity mechanism\
    \ [RFC4474].\n   However, this mechanism may not be compatible with CEMA, which\n\
    \   operates under the assumption that Middleboxes will modify the\n   contents\
    \ of SDP offers and answers.  Until a mechanism is available\n   that enables\
    \ a subset of the SDP to be signed, end clients that\n   support CEMA and use\
    \ fingerprint-based authentication are forced to\n   trust the entire signaling\
    \ path.  In other words, end clients must\n   accept the fact that every signaling\
    \ proxy could potentially replace\n   the fingerprints and insert a Middlebox\
    \ that acts as a TLS B2BUA.\n   An alternative solution that only requires a limited\
    \ trust in the\n   signaling plane is to use self-signed certificates together\
    \ with the\n   SIP Certificate Management Service [RFC6072].  The security provided\n\
    \   by this solution is roughly equivalent to SIP Identity and\n   fingerprint-based\
    \ authentication (in fact, RFC 6072 is based on\n   RFC 4474).  Section 7.5 discusses\
    \ this approach further.\n   In the remainder of this section, we will assume\
    \ that fingerprint-\n   based authentication is used without SIP Identity or similar\n\

- title: 7.5.  Authentication, Credentials, and Key Management
  contents:
  - "7.5.  Authentication, Credentials, and Key Management\n   One issue with the\

    \ that a CEMA-enabled MSRP endpoint also\n   support self-signed certificates\

- title: 7.6.  Endpoint Procedures for TLS Negotiation
  contents:
  - "7.6.  Endpoint Procedures for TLS Negotiation\n   The CEMA extension does not\
    \ change the endpoint procedures for TLS\n   negotiation.  As in RFC 4975, the\
    \ MSRP endpoint uses the negotiation\n   mechanisms in SDP and then the TLS handshake\
    \ to agree on mechanisms\n   and algorithms that both support.  The mechanisms\
    \ can be divided into\n   three different security levels:\n   1.  MSRPS: Security\
    \ mechanisms that do not rely on trusted signaling,\n       such as name-based\
    \ authentication\n   2.  MSRPS: Mechanisms that do rely on trusted signaling,\
    \ such as\n       fingerprint-based authentication\n   3.  MSRP: Unprotected\n\
    \   If the endpoint uses security mechanisms that do not rely on trusted\n   signaling,\
    \ the endpoint can detect if a Middlebox that acts as a\n   B2BUA is inserted.\
    \  It is therefore RECOMMENDED that such a mechanism\n   be used.\n   If the endpoint\
    \ uses security mechanisms that rely on trusted\n   signaling, the endpoint may\
    \ not be able to detect if a Middlebox that\n   acts as a B2BUA is inserted (by\
    \ the trusted network operator).  To be\n   able to eavesdrop, a Middlebox must\
    \ do an active \"attack\" on the\n   setup signaling.  A Middlebox cannot insert\
    \ itself at a later point.\n   If unprotected MSRP is used, the endpoint cannot\
    \ detect if a\n   Middlebox that acts as a B2BUA is inserted and Middleboxes may\
    \ be\n   inserted at any time during the session.\n   The mechanism in RFC 6072\
    \ [RFC6072] provides end-to-end security\n   without relying on trust in the signaling\
    \ plane and eases the use and\n   deployment of name-based authentication.\n \
    \  The procedures for choosing and offering name-based authentication,\n   fingerprint-based\
    \ authentication, and unprotected MSRP as described\n   in RFC 4975 still apply.\n"
- title: 7.7.  Fingerprint-Based Authentication
  contents:
  - "7.7.  Fingerprint-Based Authentication\n   If the endpoint cannot use a key management\
    \ protocol that does not\n   rely on trust in the signaling plane, such as name-based\n\
    \   authentication, the only alternative is fingerprint-based\n   authentication.\n\
    \   The use of fingerprint-based authentication requires integrity\n   protection\
    \ of the signaling plane.  This can, for example, be hop-by-\n   hop cryptographic\
    \ protection or cryptographic access protection\n   combined with a suitably protected\
    \ core network.  Unless\n   cryptographic end-to-end SDP integrity protection\
    \ or encryption is\n   used, this may be hard for the endpoint to decide.  In\
    \ the end, it is\n   up to the endpoint to decide whether the signaling path is\
    \ trusted\n   or not.\n   How this decision is done is implementation specific,\
    \ but normally,\n   signaling over the Internet SHOULD NOT be trusted.  Signaling\
    \ over a\n   local or closed network might be trusted.  Such networks can, for\n\
    \   example, be a closed enterprise network or a network operated by an\n   operator\
    \ that the end user trusts.  In IMS, for example, the\n   signaling traffic in\
    \ the access network is integrity protected and\n   the traffic is routed over\
    \ a closed network separated from the\n   Internet.  If the network is not trusted,\
    \ the endpoints SHOULD NOT\n   use fingerprint-based authentication.\n   When\
    \ an endpoint receives a fingerprint, that fingerprint represents\n   a binding\
    \ between the identity as established by TLS and that\n   established via SDP.\
    \  As previously noted, the fingerprint is\n   vulnerable to an active MITM attack\
    \ from any on-path proxy.\n   Endpoints SHOULD therefore locally store fingerprints\
    \ associated with\n   the relevant identities when first seen and SHOULD provide\
    \ a warning\n   when a new fingerprint is seen for what otherwise appears to be\
    \ the\n   same peer identity.  While there are valid reasons for keys to change\n\
    \   from time to time, that ought to be the exception -- hence the\n   suggested\
    \ warning.\n   It should, however, be noted that using fingerprint-based\n   authentication\
    \ over an insecure network increases the security\n   compared to unencrypted\
    \ MSRP.  In order to intercept the plaintext\n   media when fingerprint-based\
    \ authentication is used, the attacker is\n   required to be present on both the\
    \ signaling and media paths and\n   actively modify the traffic.  It is very hard\
    \ for the endpoints to\n   detect when such an attack is taking place, though.\
    \  A client using\n   DTLS-SRTP (a Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)\
    \ extension for\n   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)) [RFC5764] for Voice\
    \ over IP\n   (VoIP) media security might wish to use fingerprint-based\n   authentication\
    \ also for MSRP media security.\n   MSRPS with fingerprint-based authentication\
    \ is vulnerable to attacks\n   due to vulnerabilities in the SIP signaling.  If\
    \ there are weaknesses\n   in the integrity protections on the SIP signaling,\
    \ an attacker may\n   insert malicious Middleboxes to alter, record, or otherwise\
    \ harm the\n   media.  With insecure signaling, it can be difficult for an endpoint\n\
    \   to even be aware that the remote endpoint has any relationship to the\n  \
    \ expected endpoint.  Securing the SIP signaling does not solve all\n   problems.\
    \  For example, in a SIP Secure (SIPS) environment, the\n   endpoints have no\
    \ cryptographic way of validating that one or more\n   SIP proxies in the proxy\
    \ chain are not, in fact, malicious.\n"
