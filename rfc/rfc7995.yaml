- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The RFC Series is evolving, as outlined in [RFC6949].  Future\n\
    \   documents will use a canonical format, XML, with renderings in\n   various\
    \ formats, including PDF.\n   Because PDF has a wide range of capabilities and\
    \ alternatives, not\n   all PDFs are \"equal\".  For example, visually similar\
    \ documents could\n   consist of scanned or rasterized images, or include text\
    \ layout\n   options, hyperlinks, embedded fonts, and digital signatures.  (See\n\
    \   [APP-PDF] for a history of PDF.)\n   This document explains some of the relevant\
    \ options and makes\n   recommendations, for both the RFC Series and Internet-Drafts.\n\
    \   The PDF format and the tools to manipulate it are not as well known\n   as\
    \ those for the other RFC formats, at least in the IETF community.\n   This document\
    \ discusses some of the processes for creating and using\n   PDFs using both open\
    \ source and commercial products.\n   The details described in this document are\
    \ expected to change based\n   on experience gained in implementing the new publication\
    \ toolsets.\n   Revised documents will be published capturing those changes as\
    \ the\n   toolsets are completed.  Other implementers must not expect those\n\
    \   changes to remain backwards-compatible with the details described in\n   this\
    \ document.\n"
- title: 2.  Choosing PDF Versions and Standards
  contents:
  - "2.  Choosing PDF Versions and Standards\n   PDF [PDF] has gone through several\
    \ revisions, primarily for the\n   addition of features.  PDF features have generally\
    \ been added in a\n   way that older viewers \"fail gracefully\", but even so,\
    \ the older the\n   PDF version produced, the more legacy viewers will support\
    \ that\n   version but the fewer features will be enabled.\n   As PDF has evolved\
    \ a broad set of capabilities, additional standards\n   for PDF files are applicable.\
    \  These standards establish ground rules\n   that are important for specific\
    \ applications.  For example, PDF/X was\n   specifically designed for Prepress\
    \ digital data exchange, with\n   careful attention to color management and printing\
    \ instructions.  The\n   PDF/E standard was designed for engineering documents\
    \ with dynamic\n   workflows (where a document continues to be revised after\n\
    \   publication) and allows interactive media (including animation\n   and 3D).\n\
    \   Two additional standards families are important to the RFC format,\n   though:\
    \ long-term preservation (PDF/A), and user accessibility\n   (PDF/UA [PDFUA]).\
    \  These then have sub-profiles (PDF/A-1, PDF/A-2\n   [PDFA2], PDF/A-3 [PDFA3]),\
    \ each of which has conformance levels.\n   These standards are then supported\
    \ by various software libraries and\n   tools.\n   It is effective and useful\
    \ to use these standards to capture PDF for\n   RFC requirements, and they will\
    \ make the PDF files useful in\n   workflows that expect them.\n   Recommendations:\n\
    \   o  Use PDF 1.7; although relatively recent, it is well supported by\n    \
    \  widely available viewers.\n   o  For RFCs, require PDF/A-3 with conformance\
    \ level \"U\".  This\n      captures the archivability and long-term stability\
    \ of PDF 1.7\n      files, mandatory Unicode mapping (Sections 14.8.2.4.2 (\"\
    Unicode\n      Mapping in Tagged PDF\") and 9.10.2 (\"Mapping Character Codes\
    \ to\n      Unicode Values\") of [PDF]), and many of the requirement features.\n\
    \   o  Use PDF/A-3 for embedding additional data (including the XML\n      source\
    \ file) in RFCs and Internet-Drafts.\n   o  Use PDF/UA for user accessibility.\n"
- title: 3.  Options and Requirements for PDF RFCs
  contents:
  - "3.  Options and Requirements for PDF RFCs\n   This section lays out options and\
    \ requirements for PDFs produced by\n   the RFC Editor for RFCs.  There are two\
    \ subsections: Section 3.1\n   covers \"visible\" requirements related to how\
    \ the PDF normally appears\n   when it is viewed with a PDF viewer; Section 3.2\
    \ covers \"invisible\"\n   options and requirements, which primarily affect the\
    \ ability to\n   process PDFs in other ways but do not ordinarily control the\
    \ way the\n   document appears.  (Of course, a viewer UI might display processing\n\
    \   capabilities, such as showing whether a document has been digitally\n   signed.)\n\
    \   In many cases, the choice of PDF requirements is heavily influenced\n   by\
    \ the capabilities of available tools to create PDFs.  Most of the\n   discussion\
    \ of tooling is to be found in Appendix C.\n"
- title: 3.1.  "Visible" Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.1.  \"Visible\" Requirements\n   PDF supports rich visible layout of fixed-sized\
    \ pages.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  General Visible Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  General Visible Requirements\n   For a consistent \"look\" of RFCs and\
    \ good style, the PDFs produced by\n   the RFC Editor should have a clear, consistent,\
    \ identifiable, and\n   easy-to-read style.  They should print well on the widest\
    \ range of\n   printers and should look good on displays of varying resolution.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  Page Size and Margins
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Page Size and Margins\n   PDF files are laid out for a particular size\
    \ of page and margins.\n   There are two paper sizes in common use: \"US Letter\"\
    \ (8.5x11 inches,\n   216x279 mm, in popular use in North America) and \"A4\"\
    \ (210x297 mm,\n   8.27x11.7 inches, standard for the rest of the world).  Usually,\
    \ PDF\n   printing software is used in a \"shrink to fit\" mode where the\n  \
    \ printing is adjusted to fit the paper in the printer.  There is some\n   controversy,\
    \ but the argument that A4 is an international standard is\n   compelling.  However,\
    \ if the margins and header positioning are\n   chosen appropriately, the document\
    \ can be printed without any\n   scaling.\n   Recommendation:  The Internet-Draft\
    \ and RFC processors should produce\n      A4 size by default.  However, the margins\
    \ and header positioning\n      need to be chosen to look good on both paper sizes\
    \ without\n      scaling.  Following the advice found in [RFC2346], this means\
    \ that\n      we should use A4 portrait mode with left and right margins of\n\
    \      20 mm, and top and bottom margins of 33 mm.\n"
- title: 3.1.3.  Headers and Footers
  contents:
  - "3.1.3.  Headers and Footers\n   Page headers and footers are part of the page\
    \ layout.  There are a\n   variety of options.  Note that page headers and footers\
    \ in PDF can be\n   typeset in a way that the entire (longer) title might fit.\n\
    \   Recommendation:  Page headers and footers should contain information\n   \
    \   similar to the headings in the current text versions of documents,\n     \
    \ including page numbers, title, author, and date.  However, the\n      page headers\
    \ and footers should be typeset in a way so as to be\n      unobtrusive.  The\
    \ page headers and footers should be placed into\n      the PDF in such a way\
    \ that they do not interfere with screen\n      readers.\n"
- title: 3.1.4.  Paragraph Numbering
  contents:
  - "3.1.4.  Paragraph Numbering\n   One common feature of the Internet-Draft output\
    \ formats is optional\n   visible paragraph numbers, to aid in discussions.  In\
    \ the PDF, and\n   thus in the printed rendition, it is possible to make paragraph\n\
    \   numbers unobtrusive and even to impinge on the margins.\n   Recommendation:\
    \  When the XML \"editing=yes\" option has been chosen,\n      show paragraph\
    \ numbers in the right margin, typeset in a way so as\n      to be unobtrusive.\
    \  (The right margin instead of the left margin\n      prevents the paragraph\
    \ numbers from being confused with the\n      section numbers.)  If possible,\
    \ the paragraph numbers should be\n      coded in such a way that they do not\
    \ interfere with screen\n      readers.\n"
- title: 3.1.5.  Paged Content Layout
  contents:
  - "3.1.5.  Paged Content Layout\n   By its nature, PDF is paginated, so pagination\
    \ issues must be\n   considered.  This is reflected in two areas: running headers\
    \ and\n   footers, and how text is laid out on a page for optimal reading.\n \
    \  Appendix B describes the process of creating a paged document from\n   running\
    \ text such that related material is present on the same page\n   together and\
    \ artifacts of pagination don't interfere with easy\n   reading of the document.\n\
    \   Layout engines differ in the quality of the algorithms used to\n   automate\
    \ these processes.  In some cases, the automated processes\n   require some manual\
    \ assistance to ensure, for example, that a text\n   line intended as a heading\
    \ is \"kept\" with the text for which it is a\n   heading.\n   Recommendations:\n\
    \   o  Headers and footers should be printed on each page.  The\n      information\
    \ should include the RFC number or Internet-Draft name,\n      the page number,\
    \ the category (e.g., Informational), a shortened\n      version of the authors'\
    \ names, the date of the RFC or\n      Internet-Draft, and the short form of the\
    \ document title.\n   o  Choose a layout engine so that\n      *  manual intervention\
    \ is minimized\n      *  widow and orphan processing is automatic\n      *  heading\
    \ and title contiguation is automatic\n"
- title: 3.1.6.  Typeface Choices
  contents:
  - "3.1.6.  Typeface Choices\n   A PDF may refer to a font by name, or it may use\
    \ an embedded font.\n   When a font is not embedded, a PDF viewer will attempt\
    \ to locate a\n   locally installed font of the same name.  If it cannot find\
    \ an exact\n   match, it will find a \"close match\".  If a close match is not\n\
    \   available, it will fall back to something implementation dependent\n   and\
    \ usually undesirable.\n   In addition, the PDF/A standards mandate the embedding\
    \ of fonts.\n   Instead of using additional software to embed the fonts, the software\n\
    \   generating the PDF files should produce PDF/A-conforming files\n   directly,\
    \ thus ensuring that all glyphs include Unicode mappings and\n   embedded fonts\
    \ from the outset.\n   If the HTML version of the document is being visually mimicked,\
    \ the\n   font(s) chosen should have both variable-width and constant-width\n\
    \   components, as well as bold and italic representations.\n   The typefaces\
    \ used by Internet-Drafts and by RFCs need not be\n   identical.\n   Few fonts\
    \ have glyphs for the entire repertoire of Unicode\n   characters; for this purpose,\
    \ the PDF generation tool may need a set\n   of fonts and a way of choosing them.\
    \  The RFC Editor is defining\n   where Unicode characters may be used within\
    \ RFCs [RFC7997].\n   Typefaces are typically licensed, and in many cases there\
    \ is a fee\n   for use by PDF creation tools; however, there is usually no fee\
    \ for\n   display or print of the embedded fonts.\n   Recommendations:\n   o \
    \ For consistent viewing, all fonts should be embedded.  The fonts\n      used\
    \ must be available for use by the IETF community.  Some\n      discussion of\
    \ available typefaces can be found in Appendix C.4.\n   o  The choice of typefaces\
    \ with respect to serif, sans-serif,\n      monospace, etc., should follow the\
    \ recommendations for HTML and\n      CSS renderings (\"CSS\" refers to a Cascading\
    \ Style Sheet) [RFC7992]\n      and [RFC7993].\n   o  The range of Unicode characters\
    \ allowed in the XML source for\n      Internet-Drafts and RFCs may be bounded\
    \ by the availability of\n      embeddable fonts with appropriate glyphs [RFC7997].\n"
- title: 3.1.7.  Hyphenation and Line Breaks
  contents:
  - "3.1.7.  Hyphenation and Line Breaks\n   Typically, when doing page layout of\
    \ running text, especially with\n   narrow page width and long words, layout processors\
    \ of English text\n   often have the option of either hyphenating words or using\
    \ existing\n   hyphens as a place to introduce word breaks.  However, inserting\
    \ line\n   breaks mid-word can be harmful when the \"word\" is actually a sequence\n\
    \   of characters representing a protocol element or protocol sequence.\n   Recommendation:\
    \  Avoid introducing hyphenated line breaks mid-word\n      into the visual display,\
    \ consistent with requirements for\n      plain text and HTML.\n"
- title: 3.1.8.  Hyperlinks
  contents:
  - "3.1.8.  Hyperlinks\n   PDF supports hyperlinks to sections of the same document\
    \ and also to\n   sections of other documents.\n   The conversion to PDF can generate:\n\
    \   o  hyperlinks within the document\n   o  hyperlinks to other RFCs and Internet-Drafts\n\
    \   o  hyperlinks to external locations\n   o  hyperlinks within a table of contents\n\
    \   o  hyperlinks within an index\n   Recommendations:\n   o  All hyperlinks available\
    \ in the HTML rendition of the RFC should\n      also be visible and active in\
    \ the PDF produced.  This includes\n      both internal hyperlinks and hyperlinks\
    \ to external resources.\n   o  The table of contents, including page numbers,\
    \ is useful when\n      printed.  Section numbers and page numbers in the table\

- title: 3.1.9.  Similarity to Other Outputs
  contents:
  - "3.1.9.  Similarity to Other Outputs\n   There is some advantage to having the\
    \ PDF files look like the text or\n   HTML renderings of the same document.  Even\
    \ so, there are several\n   options.  The PDF\n   1.  could look like the text\
    \ version of the document, or\n   2.  could look like the text version of the\
    \ document but with\n       pictures rendered as pictures instead of using their\
    \ ASCII art\n       equivalent, or\n   3.  could look like the HTML version.\n\
    \   Recommendation:  The PDF rendition should look like the HTML\n      rendition,\
    \ at least in spirit.  Some differences from the HTML\n      rendition would include\
    \ different typeface and size (chosen for\n      printing), page numbers in the\
    \ table of contents and index, and\n      the use of page headers and footers.\n\
    \   Most of the choices used for the renderings per [RFC7992] and\n   [RFC7993]\
    \ are thus applicable.  See those documents for specifics on\n   the rendering\
    \ of the specific XML elements.  Some notes:\n   o  Every place in the document\
    \ that would receive an HTML ID would be\n      given an identical PDF named destination.\
    \  In addition, a named\n      destination will be created for each page with\
    \ the form \"pg-#\", as\n      in \"pg-35\".\n   o  No pilcrows are generated\
    \ or made visible.\n   o  The table of contents (generated if the XML's <rfc>\
    \ element's\n      tocInclude attribute has the value \"true\") [RFC7991] will\
    \ have the\n      section number linked to the section start but will also include\
    \ a\n      page number that is linked to the corresponding page.  The section\n\
    \      title and the page number will be separated by a visually\n      appropriate\
    \ separator, and the page numbers will be aligned with\n      each other.\n  \
    \ o  The index (generated if the XML's <rfc> element's indexInclude\n      attribute\
    \ has the value \"true\") will have the section number\n      linked to that section\
    \ named destination but will also include a\n      page number that is linked\
    \ to the page named destination.\n   o  The running header in one line (on page\
    \ 2 and all subsequent\n      pages) has the RFC number on the left (RFC NNNN),\
    \ the (possibly\n      shortened form) title centered, and the date (Month Year)\
    \ on the\n      right.  The text is rendered in a way that is visually\n     \
    \ unobtrusive.\n   o  The running footer in one line (on all pages) has the author's\n\
    \      last name on the left, category centered, and the page number on\n    \
    \  the right ([Page N]).  The text is rendered in a way that is\n      visually\
    \ unobtrusive.\n   o  We should not attempt to replicate in PDF the feature of\
    \ the HTML\n      format that includes a dynamic block that displays up-to-date\n\
    \      information on updates, obsoletions, and errata.\n"

    \ that the running order of text in the content stream\n      matches the logical\
    \ reading order.  That is, a sentence such as\n      \"The Internet Engineering\
    \ Task Force (IETF) supports the\n      Internet.\" would be kept together as\
    \ a sentence, and multiple\n      sentences within a paragraph would be kept together.\n\
    \   All of these end up with essentially the same visual representation\n   of\
    \ the output.  However, each level has trade-offs for auxiliary\n   uses, such\
    \ as searching or indexing, commenting and annotation, and\n   accessibility (text-to-speech).\
    \  Keeping the running order of text in\n   the content stream in the proper order\
    \ supports all of these\n   auxiliary uses.\n   In addition, the \"role map\"\
    \ feature of PDF (Section 14.7.3\n   (\"Structure Types\") of [PDF]) would allow\
    \ for the mapping of the\n   logical tags found in the original XML into tags\
    \ in the PDF.\n   Recommendations:\n   o  Text in content streams should follow\
    \ the XML document's logical\n      order (in the order of tags) to the extent\
    \ possible.  This will\n      provide optimal reuse by software that does not\
    \ understand\n      Tagged PDF.  (PDF/UA requires this.)\n   o  It might be possible\
    \ to use the \"role map\" annotation to capture\n      enough of the xml2rfc source\
    \ structure, to the point where it is\n      possible to reconstruct the XML source\
    \ structure completely.\n      However, there is not a compelling case to do so\
    \ over embedding\n      the original XML, as described in Section 3.2.7.\n"

- title: 3.2.7.  Embedded Files
  contents:
  - "3.2.7.  Embedded Files\n   PDF has the capability of including other files; the\
    \ files may be\n   labeled by both a media type and a role, the AFRelationship\
    \ key\n   [PDFA3].  In this way, the PDF file also acts as a container.\n   Embedded\
    \ content may be compressed.\n   Many PDF viewers support the ability to view\
    \ and extract embedded\n   files, although this capability is not universal.\n\
    \   Embedding content in the PDF file allows the PDF to act as a complete\n  \
    \ package that can be transformed, archived, and digitally signed.\n   (Some sample\
    \ code illustrating how items can be attached to a PDF\n   file and subsequently\
    \ extracted can be found at\n   <https://github.com/Aiybe/xmptest>.)  Useful possibilities:\n\
    \   o  Embed the source XML input file itself within the PDF.  If the\n      source\
    \ SVG and images for illustrations are also embedded, this\n      would make the\
    \ PDF file totally self-referential.\n   o  Embed directly extractable components\
    \ that are useful for\n      independent processing, including ABNF, MIBs, and\
    \ source code for\n      reference implementations.  This capability might be\
    \ supported\n      through other mechanisms from the XML source files but could\
    \ also\n      be supported within the PDF.\n   o  Finding, extracting, and embedding\
    \ other components may require\n      additional markup to clearly identify them\
    \ and additional review\n      to ensure the correctness of embedded files that\
    \ are not visible.\n   Recommendations:\n   o  Embed the XML source and all illustrations,\
    \ for RFCs, as a\n      standard feature for xml2rfc's PDF output.\n   o  If possible,\
    \ make this a standard feature for Internet-Drafts\n      as well.\n   o  Named\
    \ <sourcecode> entries should be embedded.\n   o  Bitmap images (SVG sources,\
    \ JPEGs, PNGs, etc.) should be embedded.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Digital Signatures
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Digital Signatures\n   The RFC Editor and staff are at times called to\
    \ provide evidence that\n   a particular RFC is the \"original\" and has not been\
    \ modified; digital\n   signatures can provide that verification.  As signatures\
    \ also apply\n   to embedded content, embedding the XML source will provide a\
    \ way of\n   signing the source XML that was used to produce the PDF file as well.\n\
    \   PDF has supported digital signatures since PDF 1.2, and there are\n   multiple\
    \ methods and options available for signing PDF files.  The\n   method chosen\
    \ for the signing of Internet-Drafts and RFCs will be\n   determined by separate\
    \ policy.\n   If PDF digital signatures are chosen, the authors suggest the\n\
    \   following:\n   o  PDF documents generated by the Internet-Draft upload tools\
    \ should\n      be signed with no restrictions on what can be done to the\n  \
    \    documents afterwards.\n   o  If Internet-Drafts are allowed to be uploaded\
    \ in PDF form by an\n      individual, the signature being added should be set\
    \ in the same\n      way as that noted in the previous paragraph.  A PDF that\
    \ would not\n      allow the IETF Secretariat to re-sign it in that fashion should\
    \ be\n      rejected.\n   o  PDF documents generated by the RFC Editor should\
    \ be signed and\n      certified, and restrictions placed on them to only allow\n\
    \      additional signatures and comments (markup) to be added.\n"

    \ to\n      avoid features (like scripting) that might trigger some of those\n\
    \      concerns.\n   Mitigations:\n   o  The toolsets for producing PDFs need\
    \ careful security reviews\n      before deploying broadly.\n   o  If users are\

    \ documents is to include the column headings of\n      a table if the table cannot\
    \ be displayed on a single page.\n      Similarly, tables should not be split\
    \ from the table titles.\n   keepWithNext and keepWithPrevious:  The XML attributes\
    \ \"keepWithNext\"\n      and \"keepWithPrevious\" should be used and followed\
