  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes Connectivity Verification (CV) Types\
    \ using\n   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) with Virtual Circuit\n  \
    \ Connectivity Verification (VCCV).  VCCV [RFC5085] provides a control\n   channel\
    \ that is associated with a pseudowire (PW), as well as the\n   corresponding\
    \ operations and management functions such as\n   connectivity/fault verification\
    \ to be used over that control channel.\n   BFD [RFC5880] is used over the VCCV\
    \ control channel primarily as a\n   pseudowire fault detection mechanism, for\
    \ detecting data-plane\n   failures.  Some BFD CV Types can additionally carry\
    \ fault status\n   between the endpoints of the pseudowire.  Furthermore, this\n\
    \   information can then be translated into the native Operations,\n   Administration,\
    \ and Maintenance (OAM) status codes used by the native\n   access technologies,\
    \ such as ATM, Frame Relay, or Ethernet.  The\n   specific details of such status\
    \ interworking are out of the scope of\n   this document, and are only noted here\
    \ to illustrate the utility of\n   BFD over VCCV for such purposes.  Those details\
    \ can be found in\n   [OAM-MSG-MAP].\n   The new BFD CV Types are PW demultiplexer-agnostic,\
    \ and hence\n   applicable for both MPLS and Layer Two Tunneling Protocol version\
    \ 3\n   (L2TPv3) pseudowire demultiplexers.  This document concerns itself\n \
    \  with the BFD VCCV operation over single-segment pseudowires (SS-PWs).\n   This\
    \ specification describes procedures only for BFD asynchronous\n   mode.\n"

- title: 3.1.  BFD CV Type Operation
  contents:
  - "3.1.  BFD CV Type Operation\n   When heart-beat indication is necessary for one\
    \ or more PWs, the\n   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC5880] provides\
    \ a means\n   of continuous monitoring of the PW data path and, in some operational\n\
    \   modes, propagation of PW receive and transmit defect state\n   indications.\n\
    \   In order to use BFD, both ends of the PW connection need to agree on\n   the\
    \ BFD CV Type to use:\n      For statically provisioned pseudowires, both ends\
    \ need to be\n      statically configured to use the same BFD CV Type (in addition\
    \ to\n      being statically configured for VCCV with the same CC Type).\n   \
    \   For dynamically established pseudowires, both ends of the PW must\n      have\
    \ signaled the existence of a control channel and the ability\n      to run BFD\
    \ on it (see Sections 3.3 and 4).\n   Once a node has selected a valid BFD CV\
    \ Type to use (either\n   statically provisioned or selected dynamically after\
    \ the node has\n   both signaled and received signaling from its peer of these\n\
    \   capabilities), it begins sending BFD Control packets:\n   o  The BFD Control\
    \ packets are sent on the VCCV control channel.  The\n      use of the VCCV control\
    \ channel provides the context required to\n      bind and bootstrap the BFD session,\
    \ since discriminator values are\n      not exchanged; the pseudowire demultiplexer\
    \ field (e.g., MPLS PW\n      Label or L2TPv3 Session ID) provides the context\
    \ to demultiplex\n      the first BFD Control packet, and thus single-hop BFD\n\
    \      initialization procedures are followed (see Section 3 of [RFC5881]\n  \
    \    and Section 6 of [RFC5882]).\n   o  A single BFD session exists per pseudowire.\
    \  Both PW endpoints\n      take the Active role sending initial BFD Control packets\
    \ with a\n      Your Discriminator field of zero, and BFD Control packets received\n\
    \      with a Your Discriminator field of zero are associated to the BFD\n   \
    \   session bound to the PW.\n   o  BFD MUST be run in asynchronous mode (see\
    \ [RFC5880]).\n   The operation of BFD VCCV for PWs is therefore symmetrical.\
    \  Both\n   endpoints of the bidirectional pseudowire MUST send BFD messages on\n\
    \   the VCCV control channel.\n   The details of the BFD state machine are as\
    \ per Section 6.2 of\n   [RFC5880].  The following scenario exemplifies the operation:\
    \ when\n   the downstream PE (D-PE) does not receive BFD Control messages from\n\
    \   its upstream peer PE (U-PE) during a certain number of transmission\n   intervals\
    \ (a number provisioned by the operator as \"Detect Mult\" or\n   detection time\
    \ multiplier [RFC5880]), D-PE declares that the PW in\n   its receive direction\
    \ is down.  In other words, D-PE enters the \"PW\n   receive defect\" state for\
    \ this PW.  After this calculated Detection\n   Time (see Section 6.8.4 of [RFC5880]),\
    \ D-PE declares the session\n   Down, and signals this to the remote end via the\
    \ State (Sta) with\n   Diagnostic code 1 (Control Detection Time Expired).  In\
    \ turn, U-PE\n   declares the PW is down in its transmit direction, setting the\
    \ State\n   to Down with Diagnostic code 3 (Neighbor signaled session down) in\n\
    \   its control messages to D-PE.  U-PE enters the \"PW transmit defect\"\n  \
    \ state for this PW.  How it further processes this error condition,\n   and potentially\
    \ conveys this status to the attachment circuits, is\n   out of the scope of this\
    \ specification, and is defined in\n   [OAM-MSG-MAP].\n"
- title: 3.2.  BFD Encapsulation
  contents:
  - "3.2.  BFD Encapsulation\n   The VCCV message comprises a BFD Control packet [RFC5880]\n\
    \   encapsulated as specified by the CV Type.  There are two ways in\n   which\
    \ a BFD connectivity verification packet may be encapsulated over\n   the VCCV\
    \ control channel.  This document defines four BFD CV Types\n   (see Section 3),\
    \ which can be grouped into two pairs of BFD CV Types\n   from an encapsulation\
    \ point of view.  See Table 1 in Section 3, which\n   summarizes the BFD CV Types.\n\
    \   o  IP/UDP BFD Encapsulation (BFD with IP/UDP Headers)\n      In the first\
    \ method, the VCCV encapsulation of BFD includes the\n      IP/UDP headers as\
    \ defined in Section 4 of [RFC5881].  BFD Control\n      packets are therefore\
    \ transmitted in UDP with destination port\n      3784 and source port within\
    \ the range 49152 through 65535.  The IP\n      Protocol Number and UDP Port numbers\
    \ discriminate among the\n      possible VCCV payloads (i.e., differentiate among\
    \ ICMP Ping and\n      LSP Ping defined in [RFC5085] and BFD).\n      The IP version\
    \ (IPv4 or IPv6) MUST match the IP version used for\n      signaling for dynamically\
    \ established pseudowires or MUST be\n      configured for statically provisioned\
    \ pseudowires.  The source IP\n      address is an address of the sender.  The\
    \ destination IP address\n      is a (randomly chosen) IPv4 address from the range\
    \ 127/8 or IPv6\n      address from the range 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:127.0.0.0/104.  The\n\
    \      rationale is explained in Section 2.1 of [RFC4379].  The Time to\n    \
    \  Live/Hop Limit and Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM)\n      procedures\
    \ from Section 5 of [RFC5881] apply to this\n      encapsulation, and hence the\
    \ TTL/Hop Limit is set to 255.\n      If the PW is established by signaling, then\
    \ the BFD CV Type used\n      for this encapsulation is either 0x04 or 0x08.\n\
    \   o  PW-ACH BFD Encapsulation (BFD without IP/UDP Headers)\n      In the second\
    \ method, a BFD Control packet (format defined in\n      Section 4 of [RFC5880])\
    \ is encapsulated directly in the VCCV\n      control channel (see Sections 6\
    \ and 8 of [RFC5882]) and the IP/UDP\n      headers are omitted from the BFD encapsulation.\
    \  Therefore, to\n      utilize this encapsulation, a pseudowire MUST use the\
    \ PW\n      Associated Channel Header (PW-ACH) Control Word format (see\n    \
    \  [RFC5586]) for its Control Word (CW) or L2-Specific Sublayer\n      (L2SS,\
    \ used in L2TPv3).\n      In this encapsulation, a \"raw\" BFD Control packet\
    \ (i.e., a BFD\n      Control packet as defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC5880] without\
    \ IP/\n      UDP headers) follows directly the PW-ACH.  The PW-ACH Channel Type\n\
    \      indicates that the Associated Channel carries \"raw\" BFD.  The PW\n  \
    \    Associated Channel (PWAC) is defined in Section 5 of [RFC4385],\n      and\
    \ its Channel Type field is used to discriminate the VCCV\n      payload types.\n\
    \      The usage of the PW-ACH on different VCCV CC Types is specified\n     \
    \ for CC Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 respectively in Sections 5.1.1,\n      5.1.2,\
    \ and 5.1.3 of [RFC5085], and in all cases requires the use\n      of a CW (see\
    \ Section 7 of [RFC4385]).  When VCCV carries PW-ACH-\n      encapsulated BFD\
    \ (i.e., \"raw\" BFD), the PW-ACH (pseudowire CW's or\n      L2SS') Channel Type\
    \ MUST be set to 0x0007 to indicate \"BFD\n      Control, PW-ACH-encapsulated\"\
    \ (i.e., BFD without IP/UDP headers;\n      see Section 5.2).  This is to allow\
    \ the identification of the\n      encased BFD payload when demultiplexing the\
    \ VCCV control channel.\n      If the PW is established by signaling, then the\
    \ BFD CV Type used\n      for this encapsulation is either 0x10 or 0x20.\n   In\
    \ summary, for the IP/UDP encapsulation of BFD (BFD with IP/UDP\n   headers),\
    \ if a PW Associated Channel Header is used, the Channel Type\n   MUST indicate\
    \ either IPv4 (0x0021) or IPv6 (0x0057).  For the PW-ACH\n   encapsulation of\
    \ BFD (BFD without IP/UDP headers), the PW Associated\n   Channel Header MUST\
    \ be used and the Channel Type MUST indicate BFD\n   Control packet (0x0007).\n"

    \  It should be noted that four BFD CV Types have been defined by\n   combining\
    \ two types of encapsulation with two types of functionality;\n   see Table 1\
    \ in Section 3.\n   Given the bidirectional nature of BFD, before selecting a\
    \ given BFD\n   CV Type capability to be used in dynamically established pseudowires,\n\
    \   there MUST be common CV Types in the VCCV capability advertised and\n   received.\
    \  That is, only BFD CV Types that were both advertised and\n   received are available\
    \ to be selected.  Additionally, only one BFD CV\n   Type can be used (selecting\
    \ a BFD CV Type excludes all the remaining\n   BFD CV Types).\n   The following\
    \ list enumerates rules, restrictions, and clarifications\n   on the usage of\
    \ BFD CV Types:\n   1.  BFD CV Types used for fault detection and status signaling\
    \ (i.e.,\n       CV Types 0x08 and 0x20) SHOULD NOT be used when a control\n \
    \      protocol such as LDP [RFC4447] or L2TPV3 [RFC3931] is available\n     \
    \  that can signal the AC/PW status to the remote endpoint of the\n       PW.\
    \  More details can be found in [OAM-MSG-MAP].\n   2.  BFD CV Types used for fault\
    \ detection only (i.e., CV Types 0x04\n       and 0x10) can be used whether or\
    \ not a protocol that can signal\n       AC/PW status is available.  This includes\
    \ both statically\n       provisioned and dynamically signaled pseudowires.\n\
    \       2.1.  In this case, BFD is used exclusively to detect faults on\n    \
    \         the PW; if it is desired to convey AC/PW fault status, some\n      \
    \       means other than BFD are to be used.  Examples include\n             using\
    \ LDP status messages when using MPLS as a transport\n             (see Section\
    \ 5.4 of [RFC4447]), and the Circuit Status\n             Attribute Value Pair\
    \ (AVP) in an L2TPv3 SLI message for\n             L2TPv3 (see Section 5.4.5 of\
    \ [RFC3931]).\n   3.  Pseudowires that do not use a CW or L2SS using the PW Associated\n\
    \       Channel Header MUST NOT use the BFD CV Types 0x10 or 0x20 (i.e.,\n   \
    \    PW-ACH encapsulation of BFD, without IP/UDP headers).\n       3.1.  PWs that\
    \ use a PW-ACH include CC Type 1 (for both MPLS and\n             L2TPv3 as defined\
    \ in Sections 5.1.1 and 6.1 of [RFC5085]),\n             and MPLS CC Types 2 and\
    \ 3 when using a Control Word (as\n             specified in Sections 5.1.2 and\
    \ 5.1.3 of [RFC5085]).  This\n             restriction stems from the fact that\
    \ the encapsulation uses\n             the Channel Type in the PW-ACH.\n     \
    \  3.2.  PWs that do not use a PW-ACH can use the VCCV BFD\n             encapsulation\
    \ with IP/UDP headers, as the only VCCV BFD\n             encapsulation supported.\
    \  Using the IP/UDP encapsulated BFD\n             CV Types allows for the concurrent\
    \ use of other VCCV CV\n             Types that use an encapsulation with IP headers\
    \ (e.g., ICMP\n             Ping or LSP Ping defined in [RFC5085]).\n   4.  Only\
    \ a single BFD CV Type can be selected and used.  All BFD CV\n       Types are\
    \ mutually exclusive.  After selecting a BFD CV Type, a\n       node MUST NOT\
    \ use any of the other three BFD CV Types.\n   5.  Once a PE has chosen a single\

    \ and CV Types is\n   clearly outlined in Section 7 of [RFC5085].  This section\
    \ augments\n   these rules when the BFD CV Types defined herein are supported.\
    \  The\n   selection of a specific BFD CV Type to use out of the four available\n\
    \   CV Types defined is tied to multiple factors, as described in\n   Section\
    \ 3.3.  Given that BFD is bidirectional in nature, only CV\n   Types that are\
    \ both received and sent in VCCV capability signaling\n   advertisement can be\
    \ selected.\n   When multiple BFD CV Types are advertised, and after applying\
    \ the\n   rules in Section 3.3, the set that both ends of the pseudowire have\n\
    \   in common is determined.  If the two ends have more than one BFD CV\n   Type\
    \ in common, the following list of BFD CV Types is considered in\n   the order\
    \ of the lowest list number CV Type to the highest list\n   number CV Type, and\
    \ the CV Type with the lowest list number is used:\n   1.  0x20 - BFD PW-ACH-encapsulated\

- title: 6.  Congestion Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Congestion Considerations\n   The congestion considerations that apply to\
    \ [RFC5085] apply to this\n   mode of operation as well.  This section describes\
    \ explicitly how\n   they apply.\n   BFD as a VCCV application is required to\
    \ provide details on\n   congestion and bandwidth considerations.  BFD provides\
    \ with a desired\n   minimum transmit interval and a required minimum receive\
    \ interval,\n   negotiates the transmission interval using these configurable\
    \ fields,\n   and has a packet of fixed size (setting the transmission rate).\n\
    \   Therefore, it results in a configuration limited bandwidth\n   utilization.\
    \  As stated in [RFC5085], this is sufficient protection\n   against congestion\
    \ as long as BFD's configured maximum bit-rate is\n   minimal compared to the\
    \ bit-rate of the pseudowire the VCCV channel\n   is associated with.  If the\
    \ pseudowire bit-rate can't be guaranteed\n   to be minimal, like potentially\
    \ for highly variable bit-rate and/or\n   congestion responsive pseudowires, BFD\
    \ will be required to operate\n   using an adaptive congestion control mechanism\
    \ (for example,\n   including a throttled transmission rate on \"congestion detected\"\
    \n   situations, and a slow-start after shutdown due to congestion and\n   until\
    \ basic connectivity is verified).\n   Since the bandwidth utilized by BFD is\
    \ configuration-limited, the\n   VCCV channel MUST NOT be rate-limited below this\
    \ maximum configurable\n   bandwidth or BFD will not operate correctly.  The VCCV\
    \ channel could\n   provide rate-limiting above the maximum BFD rate, to protect\
    \ from a\n   misbehaving BFD application, so that it does not conflict and can\n\
    \   coexist.  Additionally, the VCCV channel SHOULD NOT use any\n   additional\
    \ congestion control loop that would interfere or negatively\n   interact with\
    \ that of BFD.  There are no additional congestion\n   considerations.\n"
