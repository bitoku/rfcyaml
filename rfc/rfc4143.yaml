  - "Abstract\n   This document describes the functional specification and definition\n
    \  of the ENUM Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) record for IFax service.\n   IFax
    is \"facsimile using Internet mail\".  For this use, the Domain\n   Name System
    (DNS) returns the email address of the referenced IFax\n   system.  This mechanism
    allows email-based fax communication to use\n   telephone numbers instead of requiring
    the sender to already know the\n   recipient email address.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.   Functional Specification\n   An IFax client makes a [ENUMbis] DNS query,
    using the target system's\n   telephone number.  The returned NAPTR record specifies
    an email\n   address to be used for reaching the target system.  The email address\n
    \  is then used in accordance with Simple Mode of Facsimile using\n   Internet
    Mail [RFC3965], Extended Facsimile using Internet Mail\n   [RFC2532], or Full
    Mode Fax Profile for Internet Mail [FFPIM] is\n   applied.\n   The key words \"MUST\",
    \"MUST NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", and \"MAY\"\n   in this document are
    to be interpreted as defined in \"Key words for\n   use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement
    Levels\" [KEYWORDS].\n"

  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   DNS, as used by ENUM, is a globally distributed
    database.  Thus, any\n   information stored in it is visible to anyone anonymously.
    \ Although\n   this is not qualitatively different from publication in a telephone\n
    \  directory, it does expose the data subject to automatic data\n   collection
    without any indication that this has been done or by whom.\n   Data harvesting
    by third parties is often used to generate lists of\n   targets for unrequested
    information; in short, the lists are used to\n   address \"spam\".  The publication
    of a telephone number in ENUM,\n   especially when it is an associated Internet
    fax service, may be used\n   to send \"junk faxes\", for example.\n   In the case
    of electronic mail, users subscribed to mailing lists can\n   have \"sacrificial\"
    email accounts.  These special-purpose addresses\n   help the user filter out
    unrequested email.  This is not so easy with\n   published telephone numbers.
    \ The PSTN E.164 number assignment\n   process is much more involved and less
    flexible; usually a single\n   E.164 number (or a fixed range of numbers) is associated
    with each\n   PSTN access.  Thus, it is not possible to use a \"sacrificial\"
    phone\n   number.\n   Due to the implications of publishing data in a globally
    accessible\n   database, as a principle, the data subject MUST give explicit\n
    \  informed consent to data being published in ENUM.\n   Internet Fax is based
    on existing use of Internet mail.  Developers\n   and users should also consider
    the Security Consideration sections in\n   [RFC3965] and [RFC2532].\n   In addition
    to the specific security considerations given above, the\n   Security Considerations
    section of [ENUMbis] applies to this\n   document.\n"
