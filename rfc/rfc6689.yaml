- title: 2.1.  LSP Association
  contents:
  - "2.1.  LSP Association\n   [RFC4872] introduces the concept and mechanisms to\
    \ support the\n   association of one LSP to another LSP across different RSVP\
    \ - Traffic\n   Engineering (RSVP-TE) sessions.  Such association is enabled via\
    \ the\n   introduction of the ASSOCIATION object.  The ASSOCIATION object is\n\
    \   defined in Section 16 of [RFC4872].  It is explicitly defined as\n   having\
    \ both general application and specific use within the context\n   of recovery.\
    \  End-to-end recovery usage is defined in [RFC4872] and\n   is covered in Section\
    \ 2.2 of this document.  Segment recovery usage\n   is defined in [RFC4873] and\
    \ is covered in Section 2.3 of this\n   document.  Resource sharing type LSP association\
    \ is also defined in\n   [RFC4873].  While strictly speaking, such association\
    \ is beyond the\n   scope of this document, it is covered in Section 2.4 of this\
    \ document\n   for completeness.  The remainder of this section covers generic\
    \ usage\n   of the ASSOCIATION object.\n   In general, LSP association using the\
    \ ASSOCIATION object can take\n   place based on the values carried in the ASSOCIATION\
    \ object.  This\n   means that association between LSPs can take place independently\
    \ of\n   and across different sessions.  This is a significant enhancement\n \
    \  from the association of LSPs that is possible in base MPLS [RFC3209]\n   and\
    \ GMPLS [RFC3473].\n   When using the ASSOCIATION object, LSP association is always\n\
    \   initiated by an upstream node that inserts appropriate ASSOCIATION\n   objects\
    \ in the Path message of LSPs that are to be associated.\n   Downstream nodes\
    \ then correlate LSPs based on received ASSOCIATION\n   objects.  Multiple types\
    \ of LSP association are supported by the\n   ASSOCIATION object, and downstream\
    \ correlation is made based on the\n   type.\n   [RFC4872] defines Class Types\
    \ (C-Types) 1 and 2 of the ASSOCIATION\n   object.  Both objects have essentially\
    \ the same semantics, only\n   differing in the type of address carried (IPv4\
    \ and IPv6).  The\n   defined objects carry multiple fields.  The fields, taken\
    \ together,\n   enable the identification of which LSPs are in association with\
    \ one\n   another.  The [RFC4872]-defined fields are:\n      o  Association Type:\n\
    \         This field identifies the usage, or application, of the\n         ASSOCIATION\
    \ object.  The currently defined values are\n         \"Recovery\" [RFC4872] and\
    \ \"Resource Sharing\" [RFC4873].  This\n         field also scopes the interpretation\
    \ of the object.  In other\n         words, the type field is included when matching\
    \ LSPs (i.e., the\n         type fields must match), and the way associations\
    \ are\n         identified may be type dependent.\n      o  Association Source:\n\
    \         This field is used to provide global scope (within the address\n   \
    \      space) to the identified association.  There are no specific\n        \
    \ rules in the general case for which an address should be used\n         by a\
    \ node creating an ASSOCIATION object beyond that the\n         address is \"\
    associated to the node that originated the\n         association\", see [RFC4872].\n\
    \      o  Association ID:\n         This field provides an \"identifier\" that\
    \ further scopes an\n         association.  Again, this field is combined with\
    \ the other\n         ASSOCIATION object fields to support identification of\n\
    \         associated LSPs.  The generic definition does not provide any\n    \
    \     specific rules on how matching is to be done, so such rules are\n      \
    \   governed by the Association Type.  Note that the definition\n         permits\
    \ the association of an arbitrary number of LSPs.\n   As defined, the ASSOCIATION\
    \ object may only be carried in a Path\n   message, so LSP association takes place\
    \ based on the Path state.  The\n   definition permits one or more objects to\
    \ be present.  The support\n   for multiple objects enables an LSP to be associated\
    \ with other LSPs\n   in more than one way at a time.  For example, an LSP may\
    \ carry one\n   ASSOCIATION object to associate the LSP with another LSP for\n\
    \   end-to-end recovery, and at the same time carry a second ASSOCIATION\n   object\
    \ to associate the LSP with another LSP for segment recovery,\n   and at the same\
    \ time carry a third ASSOCIATION object to associate\n   the LSP with yet another\
    \ LSP for resource sharing.\n"
- title: 2.2.  End-to-End Recovery LSP Association
  contents:
  - "2.2.  End-to-End Recovery LSP Association\n   The association of LSPs in support\
    \ of end-to-end LSP recovery is\n   defined in Section 16.2 of [RFC4872].  There\
    \ are also several\n   additional related conformance statements (i.e., use of\
    \ [RFC2119]\n   defined key words) in Sections 7.3, 8.3, 9.3, and 11.1 of [RFC4872].\n\
    \   When analyzing the definition, as with any Standards Track RFC, it is\n  \
    \ critical to note and differentiate which statements are made using\n   [RFC2119]\
    \ defined key words, which relate to conformance, and which\n   statements are\
    \ made without such key words, and are thereby only\n   informative in nature.\n\
    \   As defined in Section 16.2, end-to-end recovery-related LSP\n   association\
    \ may take place in two distinct forms:\n      a. Between multiple (one or more)\
    \ working LSPs and a single shared\n         (associated) recovery LSP.  This\
    \ form essentially matches the\n         shared 1:N (N >= 1) recovery type described\
    \ in the other\n         sections of [RFC4872].\n      b. Between a single working\
    \ LSP and multiple (one or more)\n         recovery LSPs.  This form essentially\
    \ matches all other\n         recovery types described in [RFC4872].\n   Both\
    \ forms share the same Association Type (Recovery) and the same\n   Association\
    \ Source (the working LSP's tunnel sender address).  They\n   also share the same\
    \ definition of the Association ID, which is\n   (quoting [RFC4872]):\n      The\
    \ Association ID MUST be set to the LSP ID of the LSP being\n      protected by\
    \ this LSP or the LSP protecting this LSP.  If unknown,\n      this value is set\
    \ to its own signaled LSP_ID value (default).\n      Also, the value of the Association\
    \ ID MAY change during the\n      lifetime of the LSP.\n   The interpretation\
    \ of the above is fairly straightforward.  The\n   Association ID carries one\
    \ of three values:\n      -  The LSP ID of the LSP being protected.\n      - \
    \ The LSP ID of the protection LSP.\n      -  In the case where the matching LSP\
    \ is not yet known (i.e.,\n         initiated), the LSP ID value of the LSP itself.\n\
    \   The text also explicitly allows for changing the Association ID\n   during\
    \ the lifetime of an LSP.  However, this is only an option, and\n   is neither\
    \ required (i.e., \"MUST\") nor recommended (i.e., \"SHOULD\").\n   It should\
    \ be noted that [RFC4872] does not describe when such a\n   change should be initiated\
    \ or the procedures for executing such a\n   change.  Clearly, care needs to be\
    \ taken when changing the\n   Association ID to ensure that the old association\
    \ is not lost during\n   the transition to a new association.\n   The text does\
    \ not preclude, and it is therefore assumed, that one or\n   more ASSOCIATION\
    \ objects may also be added to an LSP that was\n   originated without any ASSOCIATION\
    \ objects.  Again, this is a case\n   that is not explicitly discussed in [RFC4872].\n\
    \   From the above, this means that the following combinations may occur:\n  \
    \    Case 1. When the ASSOCIATION object of the LSP being protected is\n     \
    \         initialized before the ASSOCIATION objects of any recovery\n       \
    \       LSPs are initialized, the Association ID in the LSP being\n          \
    \    protected and any recovery LSPs will carry the same value,\n            \
    \  and this value will be the LSP ID value of the LSP being\n              protected.\n\
    \      Case 2. When the ASSOCIATION object of a recovery LSP is\n            \
    \  initialized before the ASSOCIATION object of any protected\n              LSP\
    \ is initialized, the Association ID in the recovery LSP\n              and any\
    \ LSPs being protected by that LSP will carry the\n              same value, and\
    \ this value will be the LSP ID value of the\n              recovery LSP.\n  \
    \    Case 3. When the ASSOCIATION objects of both the LSP being\n            \
    \  protected and the recovery LSP are concurrently\n              initialized,\
    \ the value of the Association ID carried in\n              the LSP being protected\
    \ is the LSP ID value of the\n              recovery LSP, and the value of the\
    \ Association ID carried\n              in the recovery LSP is the LSP ID value\
    \ of the LSP being\n              protected.  As this case can only be applied\
    \ to LSPs with\n              matching tunnel sender addresses, the scope of this\
    \ case\n              is limited to end-to-end recovery.  Note that this is\n\
    \              implicit in [RFC4872], as its scope is limited to end-to-\n   \
    \           end recovery.\n   In practical terms, Case 2 will only occur when\
    \ using the shared 1:N\n   (N >= 1) end-to-end recovery type, and Case 1 will\
    \ occur with all\n   other end-to-end recovery types.  Case 3 is allowed, and\
    \ it is\n   subject to interpretation as to how often it will occur.  Some\n \
    \  believe that this will be the common case and, furthermore, that\n   working\
    \ and recovery LSPs will often first be initiated without any\n   ASSOCIATION\
    \ objects, and then Case 3 objects will be added once the\n   LSPs are established.\
    \  Others believe that Case 3 will rarely, if\n   ever occur.  Such perspectives\
    \ have little impact on\n   interoperability, as an [RFC4872]-compliant implementation\
    \ needs to\n   properly handle (identify associations for) all three cases.\n\
    \   It is important to note that Section 16.2 of [RFC4872] provides no\n   further\
    \ requirements on how or when the Association ID value is to be\n   selected.\
    \  The other sections of the document do provide further\n   narrative and three\
    \ additional requirements.  In general, the\n   narrative highlights Case 3 identified\
    \ above but does not preclude\n   the other cases.  The three additional requirements\
    \ are, by [RFC4872]\n   section number:\n     o Section 7.3 -- \"The Association\
    \ ID MUST be set by default to the\n       LSP ID of the protected LSP corresponding\
    \ to N = 1.\"\n       When considering this statement together with the three\
    \ cases\n       enumerated above, it can be seen that this statement clarifies\n\
    \       which LSP ID value should be used when a single shared protection\n  \
    \     LSP is established simultaneously with Case 3, or after Case 2,\n      \
    \ and with more than one LSP to be protected.\n     o Section 8.3 -- \"Secondary\
    \ protecting LSPs are signaled by setting\n       in the new PROTECTION object\
    \ the S bit and the P bit to 1, and in\n       the ASSOCIATION object, the Association\
    \ ID to the associated\n       primary working LSP_ID, which MUST be known before\
    \ signaling of\n       the secondary LSP.\"\n       This requirement clarifies\
    \ that when using the \"Rerouting without\n       Extra-Traffic\" type of recovery,\
    \ it is required to follow either\n       Case 1 or 3, but not 2, as enumerated\
    \ above.\n     o Section 9.3 -- \"Secondary protecting LSPs are signaled by setting\n\
    \       in the new PROTECTION object the S bit and the P bit to 1, and in\n  \
    \     the ASSOCIATION object, the Association ID to the associated\n       primary\
    \ working LSP_ID, which MUST be known before signaling of\n       the secondary\
    \ LSP.\"\n       This requirement clarifies that when using the \"Shared-Mesh\n\
    \       Restoration\" type of recovery, it is required to follow either\n    \
    \   Case 1 or 3, but not 2, as enumerated above.\n     o Section 11.1 -- \"In\
    \ both cases, the Association ID of the\n       ASSOCIATION object MUST be set\
    \ to the LSP ID value of the\n       signaled LSP.\"\n       This requirement\
    \ clarifies that when using the \"LSP Rerouting\"\n       type of recovery, it\
    \ is required to follow either Case 1 or 3,\n       but not 2, as enumerated above.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Segment Recovery LSP Association
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Segment Recovery LSP Association\n   GMPLS segment recovery is defined\
    \ in [RFC4873].  Segment recovery\n   reuses the LSP association mechanisms, including\
    \ the Association Type\n   field value, defined in [RFC4872].  The primary text\
    \ to this effect\n   in [RFC4873] is:\n      3.2.1.  Recovery Type Processing\n\
    \      Recovery type processing procedures are the same as those defined\n   \
    \   in [RFC4872], but processing and identification occur with respect\n     \

    \ that Case 2, as enumerated above, is to be\n   followed; furthermore, the Association\

- title: 2.4.  Resource Sharing LSP Association
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Resource Sharing LSP Association\n   Section 3.2.2 of [RFC4873] defines\
    \ an additional type of LSP\n   association that is used for \"Resource Sharing\"\
    .  Resource sharing\n   enables the sharing of resources across LSPs with different\
    \ SESSION\n   objects.  Without this object, only sharing across LSPs with a shared\n\
    \   SESSION object is possible, see [RFC3209].\n   Resource sharing is indicated\
    \ using a new Association Type value.  As\n   the Association Type field value\
    \ is not the same as what is used in\n   recovery type LSP association, the semantics\
    \ used for the association\n   of LSPs using an ASSOCIATION object containing\
    \ the new type differs\n   from recovery type LSP association.\n   Section 3.2.2\
    \ of [RFC4873] states the following rules for the\n   construction of an ASSOCIATION\
    \ object in support of resource sharing\n   type LSP association:\n      o  The\
    \ Association Type value is set to \"Resource Sharing\".\n      o  Association\

    \ set of LSPs to be associated.\n         The setting of the Association ID value\
    \ to the working LSP's\n         LSP ID value is mentioned, but using the \"MAY\"\
    \ key word.  Per\n         [RFC2119], this translates to the use of the LSP ID\
    \ value as\n         being completely optional and that the choice of Association\
    \ ID\n         is truly up to the originating node.\n   Additionally, the identical\
    \ ASSOCIATION object is used for all LSPs\n   that should be associated using\
    \ Resource Sharing.  This differs from\n   recovery type LSP association where\
    \ it is possible for the LSPs to\n   carry different Association ID fields and\
    \ still be associated (see\n   Case 3 in Section 2.2).\n"
- title: 3.  Association of GMPLS Recovery LSPs
  contents:
  - "3.  Association of GMPLS Recovery LSPs\n   The previous section reviews the construction\
    \ of an ASSOCIATION\n   object, including the selection of the value used in the\
    \ Association\n   ID field, as defined in [RFC4872] and [RFC4873].  This section\n\
    \   reviews how a downstream receiver identifies that one LSP is\n   associated\
    \ within another LSP based on ASSOCIATION objects.  Note\n   that this section\
    \ in no way modifies the normative definitions of\n   end-to-end and segment recovery,\
    \ see [RFC4872] or [RFC4873].\n   As the ASSOCIATION object is only carried in\
    \ Path messages, such\n   identification only takes place based on Path state.\
    \  In order to\n   support the identification of the recovery type association\
    \ between\n   LSPs, a downstream receiver needs to be able to handle all three\n\
    \   cases identified in Section 2.2.  Cases 1 and 2 are simple, as the\n   associated\
    \ LSPs will carry the identical ASSOCIATION object.  This is\n   also always true\
    \ for resource sharing type LSP association, see\n   Section 2.4.  Case 3 is more\
    \ complicated, as it is possible for the\n   LSPs to carry different Association\
    \ ID fields and still be\n   associated.  The receiver also needs to allow for\
    \ changes in the set\n   of ASSOCIATION objects included in an LSP.\n   Based\
    \ on the [RFC4872] and [RFC4873] definitions related to the\n   ASSOCIATION object,\
    \ the following behavior can be followed to ensure\n   that a receiver always\
    \ properly identifies the association between\n   LSPs:\n      o  Covering Cases\
    \ 1 and 2 and resource sharing type LSP\n         association:\n         For ASSOCIATION\

    \ by comparing all fields of each of\n         the ASSOCIATION objects carried\
    \ in the Path messages associated\n         with each LSP.  An association is\
    \ deemed to exist when the same\n         values are carried in all fields of\
    \ an ASSOCIATION object\n         carried in each LSP's Path message.  As more\
    \ than one\n         association may exist (e.g., in support of different\n  \
    \       association types or end-to-end and segment recovery), all\n         carried\
    \ ASSOCIATION objects need to be examined.\n      o  Covering Case 3:\n      \
    \   Any ASSOCIATION object with the Association Type field value of\n        \
    \ \"Recovery\" (1) that does not yield an association in the prior\n         comparison\
    \ needs to be checked to see if a Case 3 association\n         is indicated. As\
    \ this case only applies to end-to-end recovery,\n         the first step is to\
    \ locate any other LSPs with the identical\n         SESSION object fields and\
    \ the identical tunnel sender address\n         fields as the LSP carrying the\
    \ ASSOCIATION object.  If such\n         LSPs exist, a case 3 association is identified\
    \ by comparing the\n         value of the Association ID field with the LSP ID\
    \ field of the\n         other LSP.  If the values are identical, then an end-to-end\n\
    \         recovery association exists.  As this behavior only applies to\n   \
    \      end-to-end recovery, this check need only be performed at the\n       \
    \  egress.\n   No additional behavior is needed in order to support changes in\
    \ the\n   set of ASSOCIATION objects included in an LSP, as long as the change\n\
    \   represents either a new association or a change in identifiers made\n   as\
    \ described in Section 2.2.\n"
