- title: 1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.  Overview\n   Historically, experimentation with DNSSEC alternatives has been\
    \ a\n   problematic endeavor.  There has typically been a desire to both\n   introduce\
    \ non-backwards-compatible changes to DNSSEC and to try these\n   changes on real\
    \ zones in the public DNS.  This creates a problem when\n   the change to DNSSEC\
    \ would make all or part of the zone using those\n   changes appear bogus (bad)\
    \ or otherwise broken to existing security-\n   aware resolvers.\n   This document\
    \ describes a standard methodology for setting up DNSSEC\n   experiments.  This\
    \ methodology addresses the issue of coexistence\n   with standard DNSSEC and\
    \ DNS by using unknown algorithm identifiers\n   to hide the experimental DNSSEC\
    \ protocol modifications from standard\n   security-aware resolvers.\n"
- title: 2.  Definitions and Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Definitions and Terminology\n   Throughout this document, familiarity with\
    \ the DNS system (RFC 1035\n   [5]) and the DNS security extensions (RFC 4033\
    \ [2], RFC 4034 [3], and\n   RFC 4035 [4]) is assumed.\n   The key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to\
    \ be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].\n"
- title: 3.  Experiments
  contents:
  - "3.  Experiments\n   When discussing DNSSEC experiments, it is necessary to classify\
    \ these\n   experiments into two broad categories:\n   Backwards-Compatible: \
    \ describes experimental changes that, while not\n      strictly adhering to the\
    \ DNSSEC standard, are nonetheless\n      interoperable with clients and servers\
    \ that do implement the\n      DNSSEC standard.\n   Non-Backwards-Compatible:\
    \  describes experiments that would cause a\n      standard security-aware resolver\
    \ to (incorrectly) determine that\n      all or part of a zone is bogus, or to\
    \ otherwise not interoperate\n      with standard DNSSEC clients and servers.\n\
    \   Not included in these terms are experiments with the core DNS\n   protocol\
    \ itself.\n   The methodology described in this document is not necessary for\n\
    \   backwards-compatible experiments, although it certainly may be used\n   if\
    \ desired.\n"
- title: 4.  Method
  contents:
  - "4.  Method\n   The core of the methodology is the use of strictly unknown algorithm\n\
    \   identifiers when signing the experimental zone, and more importantly,\n  \
    \ having only unknown algorithm identifiers in the DS records for the\n   delegation\
    \ to the zone at the parent.\n   This technique works because of the way DNSSEC-compliant\
    \ validators\n   are expected to work in the presence of a DS set with only unknown\n\
    \   algorithm identifiers.  From RFC 4035 [4], Section 5.2:\n      If the validator\
    \ does not support any of the algorithms listed in\n      an authenticated DS\
    \ RRset, then the resolver has no supported\n      authentication path leading\
    \ from the parent to the child.  The\n      resolver should treat this case as\
    \ it would the case of an\n      authenticated NSEC RRset proving that no DS RRset\
    \ exists, as\n      described above.\n   And further:\n      If the resolver does\
    \ not support any of the algorithms listed in\n      an authenticated DS RRset,\
    \ then the resolver will not be able to\n      verify the authentication path\
    \ to the child zone.  In this case,\n      the resolver SHOULD treat the child\
    \ zone as if it were unsigned.\n   Although this behavior isn't strictly mandatory\
    \ (as marked by MUST),\n   it is unlikely for a validator to implement a substantially\
    \ different\n   behavior.  Essentially, if the validator does not have a usable\
    \ chain\n   of trust to a child zone, then it can only do one of two things:\n\
    \   treat responses from the zone as insecure (the recommended behavior),\n  \
    \ or treat the responses as bogus.  If the validator chooses the\n   latter, this\
    \ will both violate the expectation of the zone owner and\n   defeat the purpose\
    \ of the above rule.  However, with local policy, it\n   is within the right of\
    \ a validator to refuse to trust certain zones\n   based on any criteria, including\
    \ the use of unknown signing\n   algorithms.\n   Because we are talking about\
    \ experiments, it is RECOMMENDED that\n   private algorithm numbers be used (see\
    \ RFC 4034 [3], Appendix A.1.1.\n   Note that secure handling of private algorithms\
    \ requires special\n   handing by the validator logic.  See \"Clarifications and\n\
    \   Implementation Notes for DNSSECbis\" [6] for further details.)\n   Normally,\
    \ instead of actually inventing new signing algorithms, the\n   recommended path\
    \ is to create alternate algorithm identifiers that\n   are aliases for the existing,\
    \ known algorithms.  While, strictly\n   speaking, it is only necessary to create\
    \ an alternate identifier for\n   the mandatory algorithms, it is suggested that\
    \ all optional defined\n   algorithms be aliased as well.\n   It is RECOMMENDED\
    \ that for a particular DNSSEC experiment, a\n   particular domain name base is\
    \ chosen for all new algorithms, then\n   the algorithm number (or name) is prepended\
    \ to it.  For example, for\n   experiment A, the base name of \"dnssec-experiment-a.example.com\"\
    \ is\n   chosen.  Then, aliases for algorithms 3 (DSA) and 5 (RSASHA1) are\n \
    \  defined to be \"3.dnssec-experiment-a.example.com\" and\n   \"5.dnssec-experiment-a.example.com\"\
    .  However, any unique identifier\n   will suffice.\n   Using this method, resolvers\
    \ (or, more specifically, DNSSEC\n   validators) essentially indicate their ability\
    \ to understand the\n   DNSSEC experiment's semantics by understanding what the\
    \ new algorithm\n   identifiers signify.\n   This method creates two classes of\
    \ security-aware servers and\n   resolvers: servers and resolvers that are aware\
    \ of the experiment\n   (and thus recognize the experiment's algorithm identifiers\
    \ and\n   experimental semantics), and servers and resolvers that are unaware\n\
    \   of the experiment.\n   This method also precludes any zone from being both\
    \ in an experiment\n   and in a classic DNSSEC island of security.  That is, a\
    \ zone is\n   either in an experiment and only possible to validate experimentally,\n\
    \   or it is not.\n"
- title: 5.  Defining an Experiment
  contents:
  - "5.  Defining an Experiment\n   The DNSSEC experiment MUST define the particular\
    \ set of (previously\n   unknown) algorithm identifiers that identify the experiment\
    \ and\n   define what each unknown algorithm identifier means.  Typically,\n \
    \  unless the experiment is actually experimenting with a new DNSSEC\n   algorithm,\
    \ this will be a mapping of private algorithm identifiers to\n   existing, known\
    \ algorithms.\n   Normally the experiment will choose a DNS name as the algorithm\n\
    \   identifier base.  This DNS name SHOULD be under the control of the\n   authors\
    \ of the experiment.  Then the experiment will define a mapping\n   between known\
    \ mandatory and optional algorithms into this private\n   algorithm identifier\
    \ space.  Alternately, the experiment MAY use the\n   Object Identifier (OID)\
    \ private algorithm space instead (using\n   algorithm number 254), or MAY choose\
    \ non-private algorithm numbers,\n   although this would require an IANA allocation.\n\
    \   For example, an experiment might specify in its description the DNS\n   name\
    \ \"dnssec-experiment-a.example.com\" as the base name, and declare\n   that \"\
    3.dnssec-experiment-a.example.com\" is an alias of DNSSEC\n   algorithm 3 (DSA),\
    \ and that \"5.dnssec-experiment-a.example.com\" is an\n   alias of DNSSEC algorithm\
    \ 5 (RSASHA1).\n   Resolvers MUST only recognize the experiment's semantics when\
    \ present\n   in a zone signed by one or more of these algorithm identifiers.\
    \  This\n   is necessary to isolate the semantics of one experiment from any\n\
    \   others that the resolver might understand.\n   In general, resolvers involved\
    \ in the experiment are expected to\n   understand both standard DNSSEC and the\
    \ defined experimental DNSSEC\n   protocol, although this isn't required.\n"
- title: 6.  Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Considerations\n   There are a number of considerations with using this methodology.\n\
    \   1.  If an unaware validator does not correctly follow the rules laid\n   \
    \    out in RFC 4035 (e.g., the validator interprets a DNSSEC record\n       prior\
    \ to validating it), or if the experiment is broader in scope\n       that just\
    \ modifying the DNSSEC semantics, the experiment may not\n       be sufficiently\
    \ masked by this technique.  This may cause\n       unintended resolution failures.\n\
    \   2.  It will not be possible for security-aware resolvers unaware of\n    \
    \   the experiment to build a chain of trust through an experimental\n       zone.\n"
- title: 7.  Use in Non-Experiments
  contents:
  - "7.  Use in Non-Experiments\n   This general methodology MAY be used for non-backwards\
    \ compatible\n   DNSSEC protocol changes that start out as or become standards.\
    \  In\n   this case:\n   o  The protocol change SHOULD use public IANA allocated\
    \ algorithm\n      identifiers instead of private algorithm identifiers.  This\
    \ will\n      help identify the protocol change as a standard, rather than an\n\
    \      experiment.\n   o  Resolvers MAY recognize the protocol change in zones\
    \ not signed\n      (or not solely signed) using the new algorithm identifiers.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   Zones using this methodology will be considered\
    \ insecure by all\n   resolvers except those aware of the experiment.  It is not\
    \ generally\n   possible to create a secure delegation from an experimental zone\
    \ that\n   will be followed by resolvers unaware of the experiment.\n   Implementers\
    \ should take into account any security issues that may\n   result from environments\
    \ being configured to trust both experimental\n   and non-experimental zones.\
    \  If the experimental zone is more\n   vulnerable to attacks, it could, for example,\
    \ be used to promote\n   trust in zones not part of the experiment, possibly under\
    \ the control\n   of an attacker.\n"
