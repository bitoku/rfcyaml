- title: 3.  Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview\n   There is a need for a standardized way of providing the same\
    \ type of\n   alarm thresholding capabilities for Counter64 objects, as already\n\
    \   exists for Counter32 objects.  The RMON-1 alarmTable objects and\n   RMON-1\
    \ notification types are specific to 32-bit objects, and cannot\n   be used to\
    \ properly monitor Counter64-based objects.  Extensions to\n   these existing\
    \ constructs which explicitly support Counter64-based\n   objects are needed.\
    \  These extensions are completely independent of\n   the existing RMON-1 alarm\
    \ mechanisms.\n   The usage of Counter64 objects is increasing.  One of the causes\
    \ for\n   this increase is the increasing speeds of network interfaces; RFC\n\
    \   2863 [RFC2863] says:\n      As the speed of network media increase, the minimum\
    \ time in which\n      a 32 bit counter will wrap decreases.  For example, a 10Mbs\
    \ stream\n      of back-to-back, full-size packets causes ifInOctets to wrap in\n\
    \      just over 57 minutes; at 100Mbs, the minimum wrap time is 5.7\n      minutes,\
    \ and at 1Gbs, the minimum is 34 seconds.  Requiring that\n      interfaces be\
    \ polled frequently enough not to miss a counter wrap\n      is increasingly problematic.\n\
    \   and therefore requires:\n      For interfaces that operate at 20,000,000 (20\
    \ million) bits per\n      second or less, 32-bit byte and packet counters MUST\
    \ be supported.\n      For interfaces that operate faster than 20,000,000 bits/second,\n\
    \      and slower than 650,000,000 bits/second, 32-bit packet counters\n     \
    \ MUST be supported and 64-bit octet counters MUST be supported.\n      For interfaces\
    \ that operate at 650,000,000 bits/second or faster,\n      64-bit packet counters\
    \ AND 64-bit octet counters MUST be\n      supported.\n   Of the variables on\
    \ which thresholds are set using RMON-1's\n   alarmTable, two of the most popular\
    \ are: ifInOctets and ifOutOctets.\n   Thus, the increasing usage of the 64-bit\
    \ versions: ifHCInOctets and\n   ifHCOutOctets means that there is an increasing\
    \ requirement to use\n   RMON-1's thresholding capability for ifHCInOctets and\
    \ ifHCOutOctets.\n   The RMON-1 Alarm Group is implemented not only by all RMON\
    \ probes,\n   but also by the SNMP agents in many other types of devices for the\n\
    \   purpose of monitoring any of their (non-RMON) integer-valued MIB\n   objects.\
    \  The fact that it has been so widely implemented indicates\n   its obvious value.\
    \  Without this extension, that obvious value is\n   becoming incomplete because\
    \ of its lack of support for 64-bit\n   integers.  This extension is the easiest,\
    \ simplest, and most\n   compatible way for an implementation to overcome that\
    \ lack of\n   support.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Relationship to the Remote Monitoring MIBs\n   This MIB is intended to\
    \ be implemented in Remote Monitoring (RMON)\n   probes, which may also support\
    \ the RMON-1 MIB [RFC2819].  Such probes\n   may be stand-alone devices, or may\
    \ be co-located with other\n   networking devices (e.g., ethernet switches and\
    \ repeaters).\n   The functionality of the High Capacity Alarm Group is a superset\
    \ of\n   RMON-1's Alarm Group.  Thus, one day in the distant future, it is a\n\
    \   possibility that RMON-1's Alarm Group will be deprecated in favor of\n   this\
    \ MIB's High Capacity Alarm Group.  However, that day will not\n   come before\
    \ this document, or one of its successors, reaches the same\n   standardization\

- title: 4.1.  MIB Group Overview
  contents:
  - "4.1.  MIB Group Overview\n   The HC-ALARM MIB contains three MIB groups:\n  \
    \   - hcAlarmControlObjects group\n        Controls the configuration of alarms\
    \ for high capacity MIB\n        object instances.\n     - hcAlarmCapabilities\
    \ group\n        Describes the high capacity alarm capabilities provided by the\n\
    \        agent.\n     - hcAlarmNotifications group\n        Provide new rising\
    \ and falling threshold notifications for high\n        capacity objects.\n"
- title: 4.1.1.  High Capacity Alarm Control Group
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  High Capacity Alarm Control Group\n   This group contains one table,\
    \ which is used by a management station\n   to configure high capacity alarm entries.\
    \  To configure alarm\n   thresholding for Counter64 or CounterBasedGauge64 objects,\
    \ a\n   management application must configure the hcAlarmTable in a manner\n \
    \  similar to how RMON-1's alarmTable is configured.\n   Because the language\
    \ in some of the DESCRIPTION clauses of objects in\n   the alarmTable is specific\
    \ to the alarmTable itself, their defined\n   semantics do not allow them to be\
    \ used for this MIB also.  Therefore,\n   the following objects are essentially\
    \ cloned from the alarmTable to\n   the hcAlarmTable:\n       alarmTable     \
    \            hcAlarmTable\n       ----------                 ------------\n  \
    \     alarmIndex                 hcAlarmIndex\n       alarmInterval          \
    \    hcAlarmInterval\n       alarmVariable              hcAlarmVariable\n    \
    \   alarmSampleType            hcAlarmSampleType\n       alarmStartupAlarm   \
    \       hcAlarmStartupAlarm\n       alarmRisingEventIndex      hcAlarmRisingEventIndex\n\
    \       alarmFallingEventIndex     hcAlarmFallingEventIndex\n       alarmOwner\
    \                 hcAlarmOwner\n       alarmStatus                hcAlarmStatus\n\
    \   In addition, the following hcAlarmTable objects are used as high\n   capacity\
    \ values instead of the corresponding 32-bit version in the\n   alarmTable.\n\
    \       alarmTable                 hcAlarmTable\n       ----------           \
    \      ------------\n       alarmValue                 hcAlarmAbsValue\n     \
    \                             hcAlarmValueStatus\n       alarmRisingThreshold\
    \       hcAlarmRisingThreshAbsValueLo\n                                  hcAlarmRisingThreshAbsValueHi\n\
    \                                  hcAlarmRisingThresholdValStatus\n       alarmFallingThreshold\

    \                                  hcAlarmFallingThresholdValStatus\n   Nevertheless,\
    \ the hcAlarmTable does have a few differences from the\n   alarmTable:\n    \
    \  - Counter64 based objects are thresholded properly\n      - an entry is not\
    \ destroyed if the instance identified by the\n        hcAlarmVariable is not\
    \ available during a polling interval.\n      - the RowStatus textual convention\
    \ is used instead of EntryStatus\n        for the hcAlarmStatus object.\n    \
    \  - the non-volatile storage of an HC alarm entry is explicitly\n        controlled\
    \ with a StorageType parameter.\n      - a counter is provided to indicate the\
    \ number of times the\n        hcAlarmVariable object value could not be retrieved\
    \ by the\n        agent.\n"

- title: 10.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB that\n   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.\
    \  Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n\
    \   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment\
    \ without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.\n\
    \   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain\n   sensitive\
    \ information. These are:\n        hcAlarmAbsValue\n        hcAlarmValueStatus\n\
    \   These objects are used together, and may expose the values of\n   particular\
    \ MIB instances, as identified by associated instances of\n   the hcAlarmVariable\
    \ object.\n        hcAlarmVariable\n   This object identifies the object instance\
    \ that the associated\n   hcAlarmEntry will periodically sample.  Because SNMP\
    \ access control\n   is articulated entirely in terms of the contents of MIB views,\
    \ no\n   access control mechanism exists that can restrict the value of this\n\
    \   object to identify only those objects that exist in a particular MIB\n   view.\
    \  Thus, because there is no acceptable means of restricting the\n   read access\
    \ that could be obtained through the alarm mechanism, the\n   probe must only\
    \ grant write access to this object in those views that\n   have read access to\
    \ all objects on the probe.\n   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.\
    \  Even if the network\n   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there\
    \ is no control as\n   to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET\n\
    \   (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.\n   It is recommended\
    \ that the implementors consider the security\n   features as provided by the\
    \ SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use\n   of the User-based Security Model\
    \ STD 62, RFC 3414 [RFC3414] and the\n   View-based Access Control Model STD 62,\
    \ RFC 3415 [RFC3415] is\n   recommended.\n   It is then a customer/user responsibility\
    \ to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB,\
    \ is properly\n   configured to give access to only the objects, and to those\n\
    \   principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET\n   (change/create/delete)\
    \ them.\n"
