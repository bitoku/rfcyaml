    \ management\n   of DOCSIS-compliant Cable Modems (CM) and Cable Modem Termination\n\
    \   Systems (CMTS).  The specification is derived from the DOCSIS Radio\n   Frequency\
    \ Interface specification [RFI1.0].  Please note that the\n   DOCSIS 1.0 standard\
    \ only required that Cable Modems implement SNMPv1\n   and to process Internet\
    \ Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) customer traffic.\n   Design choices in the original\
    \ version of this MIB module reflected\n   those requirements.  DOCSIS 1.1 [RFI1.1]\
    \ and DOCSIS 2.0 [RFI2.0]\n   require support for SNMPv3, as well as for SNMPv1\
    \ and SNMPv2c, and\n   the changes in this MIB module over the previous proposed\
    \ standard\n   version reflect those additional requirements.\n   Future versions\
    \ of DOCSIS, starting with DOCSIS 3.0 [MULPI3.0], are\n   expected to require\
    \ support for the Internet Protocol Version 6\n   (IPv6) as both a Customer Premise\
    \ Equipment (CPE) protocol and one\n   supported by the network elements of the\
    \ DOCSIS CMTS/CM system.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.1.  Structure of the MIB
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Structure of the MIB\n   This MIB module is structured into seven components.\
    \  A component\n   contains one or more MIB groups related by deprecation or logical\n\
    \   extension.\n   o  The docsDevBaseGroup extends the MIB-II 'system' group of\
    \ RFC3418\n      [RFC3418] with objects needed for cable device system management.\n\
    \      Related to this group is the docsDevBaseIgmpGroup (enabling\n      Internet\
    \ Group Management Protocol (IGMP) status and control) and\n      the docsDevBaseMaxCpeGroup\
    \ (managing the maximum number of CPEs\n      permitted access through the cable\
    \ modem).\n   o  The docsDevNmAccessGroup and the docsDevNmAccessExtGroup provide\
    \ a\n      minimum level of SNMP access security (see Section 2.7 of\n      [OSSI1.0],\
    \ Section 2 of [OSSI1.1], and Section 5 of [OSSI2.0]).\n      With the completion\
    \ of the SNMP coexistence document, RFC 3584\n      [RFC3584], these groups have\
    \ been deprecated in this version of\n      the MIB.\n   o  The docsDevSoftwareGroup,\
    \ updated by the docsDevSoftwareGroupV2,\n      provides information for network-downloadable\
    \ software upgrades.\n      See \"Handling of Software Upgrades\", below.\n  \
    \ o  The docsDevServerGroup, updated by the docsDevServerGroupV2,\n      provides\
    \ information about the progress of the interaction between\n      the CM or CMTS\
    \ and various provisioning servers.\n   o  The docsDevEventGroup, updated by the\
    \ docsDevEventGroupV2,\n      provides control and logging for event reporting.\
    \  With the\n      addition of the SNMP Notification MIB, RFC 3413 [RFC3413],\
    \ and\n      Notification Log MIB, RFC 3014 [RFC3014], which cover event\n   \
    \   reporting, the objects in this MIB module have been modified to\n      allow\
    \ for the usage of these RFCs.\n   o  The docsDevFilterGroup configures filters\
    \ at the link layer and IP\n      layer for bridged data traffic.  This group\
    \ has been deprecated in\n      this version of the MIB in favor of the docsDevFilterLLCGroup,\
    \ and\n      by groups from the Differentiated Services MIB [RFC3289] --\n   \
    \   specifically, the groups representing the Data Path, Classifier,\n      and\
    \ Actions tables from that MIB.\n   o  The docsDevCpeGroup, updated by the docsDevInetCpeGroup,\
    \ provides\n      control over which IP addresses may be used by CPEs (e.g., PCs)\n\
    \      serviced by a given cable modem.  This provides anti-spoofing\n      control\
    \ at the point of origin for a large cable modem system.\n      This group is\
    \ separate from docsDevFilter, primarily as this group\n      is only implemented\
    \ on the Cable Modem (CM) and MUST NOT be\n      implemented on the Cable Modem\
    \ Termination System (CMTS).\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  IMPORTed MIB Modules and REFERENCE Clauses
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  IMPORTed MIB Modules and REFERENCE Clauses\n   This MIB module IMPORTs\

    \ [RFC3411], IF-MIB\n   [RFC2863], RMON2-MIB [RFC4502], and DIFFSERV-MIB [RFC3289].\n\

    \ refer to [RFC868], [RFC3617], [RFI1.0], [RFI1.1],\n   [RFI2.0], [OSSI1.1], and\
    \ [OSSI2.0].\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  Persistence Model for Cable Modems
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Persistence Model for Cable Modems\n   Most of the tables in this MIB\
    \ module (e.g., docsDevNmAccessTable,\n   docsDevFilterLLCTable) are specified\
    \ not to let objects persist\n   across reboots.\n   The expectation (and current\
    \ operational practice) is that upon\n   reboot, these tables are cleared and\
    \ repopulated from the DOCSIS\n   configuration file supplied by the cable operator.\
    \  This approach\n   enables a cable modem to adapt to the current cable operator's\n\
    \   environment, which in turn enables cable modem portability across\n   different\
    \ cable operators.\n   A notable exception to the persistence model is docsDevEventTable,\n\
    \   since it is useful to maintain a record of events across reboots for\n   debugging\
    \ purposes.\n"
- title: 3.1.3.  IPv4 Compliance
  contents:
  - "3.1.3.  IPv4 Compliance\n   Please note that the compliance statements in this\
    \ version of the MIB\n   module require support only for IPv4 addresses.  That\
    \ is because the\n   current versions of the DOCSIS protocols (1.0, 1.1, and 2.0)\
    \ are not\n   IPv6 capable.  Although support for IPv6 will require changes to\
    \ the\n   DOCSIS protocols, it is expected that the only changes needed to the\n\
    \   MIB module itself will be the addition of new compliance statements\n   that\
    \ mandate support for IPv6 addresses.\n"

- title: 3.2.1.  Handling of Software Upgrades
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Handling of Software Upgrades\n   The Cable Modem software upgrade process\
    \ is documented in [RFI1.0].\n   From a network management station, the operator\n\
    \   o  sets docsDevSwServer to the address of the Trivial File Transfer\n    \
    \  Protocol (TFTP) server for software upgrades;\n   o  sets docsDevSwFilename\
    \ to the file pathname of the software\n      upgrade image; and\n   o  sets docsDevSwAdminStatus\
    \ to upgrade-from-mgt.\n   Although DOCSIS only specifies the implementation of\
    \ the TFTP\n   protocol [RFC1350] for file transfers, other functional entities\n\
    \   embedded within the cable device (particularly a PacketCable\n   Multimedia\
    \ Terminal Adapter [MTA-PROV]) specify the optional\n   implementation of the\
    \ Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC1945]\n   and [RFC2616] for file transfers.\
    \  The value of the\n   docsDevSwServerTransportProtocol object determines which\
    \ protocol is\n   used for SNMP-initiated software upgrade.\n   One reason for\
    \ the SNMP-initiated upgrade is to allow loading of a\n   temporary software image\
    \ (e.g., special diagnostic software) that\n   differs from the software normally\
    \ used on that device without\n   changing the provisioning database.\n   Note\
    \ that software upgrades should not be accepted blindly by the\n   cable device.\
    \  The cable device may refuse an upgrade if\n   o  the download is incomplete;\n\
    \   o  the file contents are incomplete or damaged; or\n   o  the software is\
    \ not intended for that hardware device (this may\n      include the case of a\
    \ feature set that has not been purchased for\n      this device).\n   A cable\
    \ device that implements the code verification mechanisms of\n   [BPIPLUS] verifies\
    \ the source and integrity of the downloaded image\n   by validating one or more\
    \ Code Verification Signatures that are\n   bundled within the software upgrade.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  Events and Notifications
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Events and Notifications\n   This MIB module provides control facilities\
    \ for reporting events\n   through syslog [RFC3164], notifications (traps and\
    \ informs), and\n   non-volatile logging.  Additional controls allow the agent\
    \ to use the\n   SNMP Notification MIB [RFC3413] and Notification Log MIB [RFC3014]\n\
    \   for event notification.\n   The conventions for event reporting are outside\
    \ the scope of this\n   document.  The definition and coding of common DOCSIS\
    \ notifications\n   can be found in [RFC4547].\n"
- title: 3.2.3.  Notification Throttling
  contents:
  - "3.2.3.  Notification Throttling\n   The CM and CMTS MUST provide support for\
    \ notification message\n   throttling as described below.  The network operator\
    \ can employ\n   notification rate throttling or notification limiting by manipulating\n\
    \   the appropriate MIB variables.\n"
- title: 3.2.3.1.  Notification Rate Throttling
  contents:
  - "3.2.3.1.  Notification Rate Throttling\n   Network operators may employ either\
    \ of two rate control methods.  In\n   the first method, the device ceases to\
    \ send notifications when the\n   rate exceeds the specified maximum message rate.\
    \  It resumes sending\n   notifications only if reactivated by a network management\
    \ station\n   request.\n   In the second method, the device resumes sending notifications\
    \ when\n   the rate falls below the specified maximum message rate.\n   The network\
    \ operator configures the specified maximum message rate by\n   setting the measurement\
    \ interval (in seconds), and the maximum number\n   of notifications to be transmitted\
    \ within the measurement interval.\n   The operator can query the operational\
    \ throttling state (to determine\n   whether notifications are enabled or blocked\
    \ by throttling) of the\n   device, as well as query and set the administrative\
    \ throttling state\n   (to manage the rate control method) of the device.\n"
- title: 3.2.3.2.  Limiting the Notification Rate
  contents:
  - "3.2.3.2.  Limiting the Notification Rate\n   Network operators may wish to limit\
    \ the number of notifications sent\n   by a device over a specified time period.\
    \  The device ceases to send\n   notifications when the number of notifications\
    \ exceeds the specified\n   threshold.  It resumes sending notifications only\
    \ when the\n   measurement interval has passed.\n   The network operator defines\
    \ the maximum number of notifications he\n   is willing to handle and sets the\
    \ measurement interval to a large\n   number (in hundredths of a second).  For\
    \ this case, the\n   administrative throttling state is set to stop at a threshold\
    \ that is\n   the maximum number of notifications.\n   See \"Techniques for Managing\
    \ Asynchronously Generated Alerts\"\n   [RFC1224] for additional technical motivations.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Protocol Filters
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Protocol Filters\n   The Cable Device MIB provides objects for both Link\
    \ Layer Control\n   (LLC) and IP protocol filters.  The LLC protocol filter entries\
    \ can\n   be used to limit CM forwarding to a restricted set of network-layer\n\
    \   protocols (such as IP, Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX), Network\n   Basic\
    \ Input/Output System (NetBIOS), and Appletalk).\n   The IP protocol filter entries\
    \ can be used to restrict upstream or\n   downstream traffic according to source\

    \ to level-2 frames entering the\n   cable modem from either the RF MAC interface\

    \ are used to prohibit\n   the processing and forwarding of certain types of level-2\
    \ traffic\n   that may be disruptive to the network.  The filters, as currently\n\
    \   specified, can be set to cause the modem either to drop frames that\n   match\
    \ at least one filter, or to process a frame that matches at\n   least one filter.\
    \  Some examples of possible configurations would be\n   to permit only IP (and\
    \ ARP) traffic, or to drop NetBIOS traffic.\n"

    \ filters are applied to packets entering the modem from\n   one of the CPE interfaces\
    \ and are intended to prevent a subscriber\n   from stealing or misusing IP addresses\
    \ that were not assigned to the\n   subscriber.  If the filters are active (enabled),\
    \ the source address\n   of the IP packet must match at least one IP address in\
    \ one of these\n   two tables (docsDevCpeTable or docsDevCpeInetTable), or it\
    \ is\n   discarded without further processing.\n   To prevent potential implementation\
    \ ambiguity, the device consults\n   the docsDevCpeTable for the IP packet source\
    \ address before\n   consulting the docsDevCpeInetTable.\n   The table can be\
    \ automatically populated where the first N different\n   IP addresses seen from\
    \ the CPE side of the cable modem are used to\n   populate the table automatically.\
    \  The spoofing filters are specified\n   in the docsDevCpeTable and the docsDevCpeInetTable,\
    \ and the policy\n   for automatically creating filters in those tables is controlled\
    \ by\n   docsDevCpeEnroll and docsDevMaxCpe, as well as by the network\n   management\

  - "3.3.3.  IP Filtering: docsDevFilterIpTable\n   The IP Filtering table acts as\
    \ a classifier table.  Each row in the\n   table describes a template against\
    \ which IP packets are compared.\n   The template includes source and destination\
    \ addresses (and their\n   associated masks), upper level protocol (e.g., TCP,\
    \ UDP), source and\n   destination port ranges, and Terms of Service (ToS) values.\
    \  A row\n   also contains interface and traffic direction match values that have\n\
    \   to be considered in combination.  All columns of a particular row\n   must\
    \ match the appropriate fields in the packet and must match the\n   interface\
    \ and direction items for the packet to result in a match to\n   the packet.\n\
    \   When classifying a packet, each table is scanned, beginning with the\n   lowest\
    \ number filter.  If the agent finds a match, it applies the\n   group of policies\
    \ specified.  If the matched filter has the continue\n   bit set, the agent continues\
    \ the scan possibly matching additional\n   filters and applying additional policies.\
    \  For example, this allows\n   the agent to take one set of actions for the 24.0.16/255.255.255.0\n\
    \   group and one set of actions for telnet packets to/from 24.0.16.30,\n   and\
    \ these sets of actions may not be mutually exclusive.\n   Once a packet is matched,\
    \ one of three actions happen according to\n   the setting of docsDevFilterIpControl\
    \ in the row.  The packet may be\n   dropped, in which case no further processing\
    \ is required.  The packet\n   may be accepted, and processing of the packet continues.\
    \  Lastly, the\n   packet may have a set of policy actions applied to it.  If\n\
    \   docsDevFilterIpContinue is set to true, scanning of the table\n   continues\
    \ and additional matches may result.\n   When a packet matches and docsDevFilterIpControl\
    \ in the filter\n   matched is set to 'policy', the value of docsDevFilterIpPolicyId\
    \ is\n   used as a selector into the docsDevFilterPolicyTable.  The first\n  \
    \ level of indirection may result in zero or more actions being taken\n   according\
    \ to the match.  The docsDevFilterPolicyTable is scanned in\n   row order, and\
    \ all rows where docsDevFilterPolicyId equals\n   docsDevFilterIpPolicyId have\
    \ the action specified by the\n   docsDevFilterPolicyValue 'executed'.\n   For\
    \ an example of the use of these IP Filtering MIB tables, see\n   [RFC2669].\n\
    \   The IP Filtering table and related tables have been deprecated in\n   this\
    \ version of the MIB in favor of the Data Path, Classifier, and\n   Action tables\
    \ from the Differentiated Services MIB [RFC3289].  See\n   the body of the MIB\
    \ for the description of how agents should handle\n   the interaction between\

  - "5.1.  Revision Descriptions\n   This document contains the following revisions\
    \ over RFC 2669:\n   o  All IPv4 address objects were either deprecated and replaced\
    \ or\n      mirrored with IPv6 objects, where appropriate, following the\n   \
    \   guidelines of RFC 4001 [RFC4001].  In particular,\n      docsDevCpeInetTable\
    \ was added, and the docsDevFilterGroup objects\n      were deprecated in favor\
    \ of the DiffServ MIB.\n   o  Objects that were obviated by SNMPv3 and the SNMP\
    \ Coexistence MIBs\n      have been deprecated; e.g., docsDevNmAccessTable.\n\
    \   o  A new object, docsDevIgmpModeControl, has been added to control\n     \
    \ passive versus active IGMP modem operation.\n   o  A new object, docsDevMaxCpe,\
    \ has been added to report the maximum\n      number of CPEs granted network access\
    \ across the CM.\n   o  A new object, docsDevSwServerTransportProtocol, has been\
    \ added to\n      docsDevSoftware, and other object DESCRIPTIONs have been modified,\n\
    \      to enable the use of either TFTP or HTTP for software downloads to\n  \
    \    the device.\n   o  A new object, docsDevEvThrottleThresholdExceeded, has\
    \ been added\n      to replace docsDevEvThrottleInhibited for simplification of\
    \ event\n      threshold management.\n   o  The docsDevEvReporting object has\
    \ been modified to enable local\n      logging to the internal volatile log, and\
    \ not to the internal\n      non-volatile log.\n   o  Minor updates to the description\
    \ text have been made to a number\n      of objects to clarify their meaning.\n\
    \   o  The compliance statements were updated to reflect current\n      requirements\
    \ (including making the docsDevCpe objects optional)\n      and split between\
    \ CM and CMTS devices.\n   o  Text was added to indicate support of the SNMP Notification\

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This MIB module relates to a system that will\
    \ provide metropolitan\n   public internet access.  As such, improper manipulation\
    \ of the\n   objects represented by this MIB module may result in denial of\n\
    \   service to a large number of end-users.  In addition, manipulation of\n  \
    \ docsDevNmAccessTable, docsDevFilterLLCTable, docsDevFilterIpTable,\n   docsDevFilterInetTable,\
    \ and the elements of the docsDevCpe and\n   docsDevCpeInetTable groups may allow\
    \ an end-user to increase his or\n   her service levels, spoof his or her IP addresses,\
    \ change the\n   permitted management stations, or affect other end-users in either\
    \ a\n   positive or negative manner.\n   It is recommended that the implementors\
    \ prevent the \"tiny fragment\"\n   and \"overlapping fragment\" attacks for the\
    \ IP filtering tables in\n   this MIB module, as discussed in [RFC1858] and [RFC3128].\
    \  Prevention\n   of these attacks can be implemented with the following rules,\
    \ when\n   TCP source and/or destination port filtering is enabled:\n   o  Admit\
    \ all packets with fragment offset >= 2.\n   o  Discard all packets with fragment\
    \ offset = 1, or with fragment\n      offset = 0 AND fragment payload length <\
    \ 16.\n   o  Apply filtering rules to all packets with fragment offset = 0.\n\
    \   This MIB module does not affect confidentiality of services on a\n   cable\
    \ modem system.  [BPI] and [BPIPLUS] specify the implementation\n   of the DOCSIS\
    \ Baseline Privacy and Baseline Privacy Plus mechanisms\n   for data transmission\
    \ confidentiality.\n   There are a number of management objects defined in this\
    \ MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such\n\
    \   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n   environments.\
    \  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment without proper\
    \ protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.  These are\
    \ the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   o  The use\
    \ of docsDevNmAccessTable to specify management stations is\n      considered\
    \ only limited protection and does not protect against\n      attacks that spoof\
    \ the management station's IP address.  The use\n      of stronger mechanisms,\
    \ such as SNMPv3 security, should be\n      considered, where possible.  Specifically,\
    \ SNMPv3 USM [RFC3414]\n      and VACM [RFC3415] MUST be used with any v3 agent\
    \ that implements\n      this MIB module.\n   o  The CM may have its software\
    \ changed by the actions of the\n      management system using a combination of\
    \ the following objects:\n      docsDevSwServer, docsDevSwFilename, docsDevSwAdminStatus,\n\
    \      docsDevSwServerAddressType, docsDevSwServerAddress, and\n      docsDevSwServerTransportProtocol.\
    \  An improper software download\n      may result in substantial vulnerabilities\
    \ and the loss of the\n      ability of the management system to control the cable\
    \ modem.  A\n      cable device SHOULD implement the code verification mechanisms\
    \ of\n      [BPIPLUS] to verify the source and integrity of downloaded\n     \
    \ software images.\n   o  The device may be reset by setting docsDevResetNow =\
    \ true(1).\n      This causes the device to reload its configuration files, as\
    \ well\n      as to eliminate all previous non-persistent network management\n\
    \      settings.  As such, this may provide a vector for attacking the\n     \
    \ system.\n   o  Setting docsDevEvThrottleAdminStatus = unconstrained(1) (which\
    \ is\n      also the DEFVAL) may cause flooding of traps, which can disrupt\n\
    \      network service.  Additionally, docsDevThrottleThreshold and\n      docsDevThrottleInterval\
    \ could also be set to high values that may\n      cause a disruption in service.\n\
    \   o  Setting docsDevDateTime to an arbitrary (incorrect) value would\n     \
    \ merely cause the device to record incorrect timestamps on many\n      events/actions\
    \ that rely on this object for reporting.\n   o  Setting docsDevEvControl to resetLog(1)\
    \ will delete any event log\n      history and could potentially impact debugging/troubleshooting\n\
    \      efforts.\n   o  Setting docsDevEvSyslog.\n   o  Setting docsDevEvReporting\
    \ to enable syslog reporting, along with\n      a redirect of the syslog server\
    \ could allow access to sensitive\n      information on network devices.  Modifying\
    \ docsDevEvSyslog,\n      docsDevEvSyslogAddressType, or docsDevEvSyslogAddress\
    \ could allow\n      a redirect of sensitive information.\n   o  Setting docsDevFilterLLCnmatchedAction\
    \ or docsDevFilterIpDefault\n      could cause significant changes to default\
    \ traffic filtering on a\n      device.\n   o  Setting docsDevCpeEnroll to any(2)\
    \ could cause the\n      docsDevFilterCPETable to be populated, which may not\
    \ be the\n      intended functionality.\n   o  Setting docsDevCpeIpMax to a value\
    \ other than that intended by the\n      MSO may allow a user to provision more\
    \ devices than the MSO would\n      like.\n   o  Setting values in the docsDevNmAccess\
    \ table can potentially\n      introduce a mechanism for users to use a local\
    \ NMS device and\n      manipulate other settings in the CM or CMTS.\n   o  Setting\
    \ values in the docsDevFilterLLC and docsDevFilterIP tables\n      can allow or\
    \ deny access to certain devices that the MSO does not\n      want.\n   o  Setting\
    \ docsDevCpeStatus and docsDevCpeInetRowStatus may allow\n      users to provision\
    \ more devices than were intended by the MSO, or\n      to provision different\
    \ ones.\n   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with\
    \ a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or\n\
    \   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to\n   control\
    \ even GET access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt\n   the values\
    \ of these objects when sending them over the network via\n   SNMP.  These are\
    \ the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   o  Rows\
    \ from docsDevNmAccessTable may provide sufficient information\n      for attackers\
    \ to spoof management stations that have management\n      access to the device.\n\
    \   o  The docsDevSwCurrentVers object may provide hints as to the\n      software\
    \ vulnerabilities of the cable device.\n   o  The docsDevFilterLLCTable and docsDevFilterLLCTable\
    \ may provide\n      clues for attacking the cable device and other subscriber\
    \ devices.\n      SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n\
    \      Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n  \
    \    even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is\n     \
    \ allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the\n      objects\
    \ in this MIB module.\n      It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the\
    \ security features\n      as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410],\
    \ section 8),\n      including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms\n\
    \      (for authentication and privacy).\n      Further, deployment of SNMP versions\
    \ prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n      RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy\
    \ SNMPv3 and to\n      enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n\
    \      responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   \
    \   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access\n     \
    \ to the objects only to those principals (users) that have\n      legitimate\
    \ rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)\n      them.\n"
