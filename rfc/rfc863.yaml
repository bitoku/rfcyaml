    the ARPA Internet community.  Hosts on\nthe ARPA Internet that choose to implement
    a Discard Protocol are\nexpected to adopt and implement this standard.\nA useful
    debugging and measurement tool is a discard service.  A discard\nservice simply
    throws away any data it receives.\nTCP Based Discard Service\n   One discard service
    is defined as a connection based application on\n   TCP.  A server listens for
    TCP connections on TCP port 9.  Once a\n   connection is established any data
    received is thrown away.  No\n   response is sent.  This continues until the calling
    user terminates\n   the connection.\nUDP Based Discard Service\n   Another discard
    service is defined as a datagram based application on\n   UDP.  A server listens
    for UDP datagrams on UDP port 9.  When a\n   datagram is received, it is thrown
    away.  No response is sent.\n"
