  - "Abstract\n   This document extends the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n\
    \   (LDAP) bind operation with a mechanism for requesting and returning\n   the\
    \ authorization identity it establishes.  Specifically, this\n   document defines\
    \ the Authorization Identity Request and Response\n   controls for use with the\
    \ Bind operation.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines support for the Authorization Identity\
    \ Request\n   Control and the Authorization Identity Response Control for\n  \
    \ requesting and returning the authorization established in a bind\n   operation.\
    \  The Authorization Identity Request Control may be\n   submitted by a client\
    \ in a bind request if authenticating with\n   version 3 of the Lightweight Directory\
    \ Access Protocol (LDAP)\n   protocol [LDAPv3].  In the LDAP server's bind response,\
    \ it may then\n   include an Authorization Identity Response Control.  The response\n\
    \   control contains the identity assumed by the client.  This is useful\n   when\
    \ there is a mapping step or other indirection during the bind, so\n   that the\
    \ client can be told what LDAP identity was granted.  Client\n   authentication\
    \ with certificates is the primary situation where this\n   applies.  Also, some\
    \ Simple Authentication and Security Layer [SASL]\n   authentication mechanisms\
    \ may not involve the client explicitly\n   providing a DN, or may result in an\
    \ authorization identity which is\n   different from the authentication identity\
    \ provided by the client\n   [AUTH].\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", and \"MAY\"\n   used in this document are to be\
    \ interpreted as described in\n   [RFCKeyWords].\n"

  - "2.  Publishing support for the Authorization Identity Request Control\n    and\
    \ the Authorization Identity Response Control\n   Support for the Authorization\
    \ Identity Request Control and the\n   Authorization Identity Response Control\
    \ is indicated by the presence\n   of the Object Identifiers (OIDs) 2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.16\
    \ and\n   2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.15, respectively, in the supportedControl\n  \
    \ attribute [LDAPATTRS] of a server's root DSA-specific Entry (DSE).\n"
- title: 3.  Authorization Identity Request Control
  contents:
  - "3.  Authorization Identity Request Control\n   This control MAY be included in\
    \ any bind request which specifies\n   protocol version 3, as part of the controls\
    \ field of the LDAPMessage\n   as defined in [LDAPPROT].  In a multi-step bind\
    \ operation, the client\n   MUST provide the control with each bind request.\n\
    \   The controlType is \"2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.16\" and the controlValue is\n\
    \   absent.\n"
- title: 4.  Authorization Identity Response Control
  contents:
  - "4.  Authorization Identity Response Control\n   This control MAY be included\
    \ in any final bind response where the\n   first bind request of the bind operation\
    \ included an Authorization\n   Identity Request Control as part of the controls\
    \ field of the\n   LDAPMessage as defined in [LDAPPROT].\n   The controlType is\
    \ \"2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.15\".  If the bind request\n   succeeded and resulted\
    \ in an identity (not anonymous), the\n   controlValue contains the authorization\
    \ identity (authzId), as\n   defined in [AUTH] section 9, granted to the requestor.\
    \  If the bind\n   request resulted in an anonymous association, the controlValue\
    \ field\n   is a string of zero length.  If the bind request resulted in more\n\
    \   than one authzId, the primary authzId is returned in the controlValue\n  \
    \ field.\n   The control is only included in a bind response if the resultCode\
    \ for\n   the bind operation is success.\n   If the server requires confidentiality\
    \ protections to be in place\n   prior to use of this control (see Security Considerations),\
    \ the\n   server reports failure to have adequate confidentiality protections\n\
    \   in place by returning the confidentialityRequired result code.\n   If the\
    \ client has insufficient access rights to the requested\n   authorization information,\
    \ the server reports this by returning the\n   insufficientAccessRights result\
    \ code.\n   Identities presented by a client as part of the authentication\n \
    \  process may be mapped by the server to one or more authorization\n   identities.\
    \  The bind response control can be used to retrieve the\n   primary authzId.\n\
    \   For example, during client authentication with certificates [AUTH], a\n  \
    \ client may possess more than one certificate and may not be able to\n   determine\
    \ which one was ultimately selected for authentication to the\n   server.  The\
    \ subject DN field in the selected certificate may not\n   correspond exactly\
    \ to a DN in the directory, but rather have gone\n   through a mapping process\
    \ controlled by the server.  Upon completing\n   the certificate-based authentication,\
    \ the client may issue a SASL\n   [SASL] bind request, specifying the EXTERNAL\
    \ mechanism and including\n   an Authorization Identity Request Control.  The\
    \ bind response MAY\n   include an Authorization Identity Response Control indicating\
    \ the DN\n   in the server's Directory Information Tree (DIT) which the\n   certificate\
    \ was mapped to.\n"
- title: 5.  Alternative Approach with Extended Operation
  contents:
  - "5.  Alternative Approach with Extended Operation\n   The LDAP \"Who am I?\" [AUTHZID]\
    \ extended operation provides a\n   mechanism to query the authorization identity\
    \ associated with a bound\n   connection.  Using an extended operation, as opposed\
    \ to a bind\n   response control, allows a client to learn the authorization identity\n\
    \   after the bind has established integrity and data confidentiality\n   protections.\
    \  The disadvantages of the extended operation approach\n   are coordination issues\
    \ between \"Who am I?\" requests, bind requests,\n   and other requests, and that\
    \ an extra operation is required to learn\n   the authorization identity.  For\
    \ multithreaded or high bandwidth\n   server application environments, the bind\
    \ response approach may be\n   preferable.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The Authorization Identity Request and Response\
    \ Controls are subject\n   to standard LDAP security considerations.  The controls\
    \ may be passed\n   over a secure as well as over an insecure channel.  They are\
    \ not\n   protected by security layers negotiated by the bind operation.\n   The\
    \ response control allows for an additional authorization identity\n   to be passed.\
    \  In some deployments, these identities may contain\n   confidential information\
    \ which require privacy protection.  In such\n   deployments, a security layer\
    \ should be established prior to issuing\n   a bind request with an Authorization\
    \ Identity Request Control.\n"

    \ are\n   reserved for the Authorization Identity Request and Response\n   Controls,\
    \ respectively.  The Authorization Identity Request Control\n   has been registered\
