  - "1. Purpose and Overview\n   There is a demand to provide assured forwarding of
    IP packets over\n   the Internet.  In a typical application, a company uses the
    Internet\n   to interconnect its geographically distributed sites and wants an\n
    \  assurance that IP packets within this intranet are forwarded with\n   high
    probability as long as the aggregate traffic from each site does\n   not exceed
    the subscribed information rate (profile).  It is\n   desirable that a site may
    exceed the subscribed profile with the\n   understanding that the excess traffic
    is not delivered with as high\n   probability as the traffic that is within the
    profile.  It is also\n   important that the network does not reorder packets that
    belong to\n   the same microflow, as defined in [Nichols], no matter if they are
    in\n   or out of the profile.\n   Assured Forwarding (AF) PHB group is a means
    for a provider DS domain\n   to offer different levels of forwarding assurances
    for IP packets\n   received from a customer DS domain.  Four AF classes are defined,\n
    \  where each AF class is in each DS node allocated a certain amount of\n   forwarding
    resources (buffer space and bandwidth). IP packets that\n   wish to use the services
    provided by the AF PHB group are assigned by\n   the customer or the provider
    DS domain into one or more of these AF\n   classes according to the services that
    the customer has subscribed\n   to. Further background about this capability and
    some ways to use it\n   may be found in [Clark].\n   Within each AF class IP packets
    are marked (again by the customer or\n   the provider DS domain) with one of three
    possible drop precedence\n   values.  In case of congestion, the drop precedence
    of a packet\n   determines the relative importance of the packet within the AF
    class.\n   A congested DS node tries to protect packets with a lower drop\n   precedence
    value from being lost by preferably discarding packets\n   with a higher drop
    precedence value.\n   In a DS node, the level of forwarding assurance of an IP
    packet thus\n   depends on (1) how much forwarding resources has been allocated
    to\n   the AF class that the packet belongs to, (2) what is the current load\n
    \  of the AF class, and, in case of congestion within the class, (3)\n   what
    is the drop precedence of the packet.\n   For example, if traffic conditioning
    actions at the ingress of the\n   provider DS domain make sure that an AF class
    in the DS nodes is only\n   moderately loaded by packets with the lowest drop
    precedence value\n   and is not overloaded by packets with the two lowest drop
    precedence\n   values, then the AF class can offer a high level of forwarding\n
    \  assurance for packets that are within the subscribed profile (i.e.,\n   marked
    with the lowest drop precedence value) and offer up to two\n   lower levels of
    forwarding assurance for the excess traffic.\n   This document describes the AF
    PHB group. An otherwise DS-compliant\n   node is not required to implement this
    PHB group in order to be\n   considered DS-compliant, but when a DS-compliant
    node is said to\n   implement an AF PHB group, it must conform to the specification
    in\n   this document.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [Bradner].\n"

  - "2. The AF PHB Group\n   Assured Forwarding (AF) PHB group provides forwarding
    of IP packets\n   in N independent AF classes.  Within each AF class, an IP packet
    is\n   assigned one of M different levels of drop precedence.  An IP packet\n
    \  that belongs to an AF class i and has drop precedence j is marked\n   with
    the AF codepoint AFij, where 1 <= i <= N and 1 <= j <= M.\n   Currently, four
    classes (N=4) with three levels of drop precedence in\n   each class (M=3) are
    defined for general use.  More AF classes or\n   levels of drop precedence MAY
    be defined for local use.\n   A DS node SHOULD implement all four general use
    AF classes.  Packets\n   in one AF class MUST be forwarded independently from
    packets in\n   another AF class, i.e., a DS node MUST NOT aggregate two or more
    AF\n   classes together.\n   A DS node MUST allocate a configurable, minimum amount
    of forwarding\n   resources (buffer space and bandwidth) to each implemented AF
    class.\n   Each class SHOULD be serviced in a manner to achieve the configured\n
    \  service rate (bandwidth) over both small and large time scales.\n   An AF class
    MAY also be configurable to receive more forwarding\n   resources than the minimum
    when excess resources are available either\n   from other AF classes or from other
    PHB groups.  This memo does not\n   specify how the excess resources should be
    allocated, but\n   implementations MUST specify what algorithms are actually supported\n
    \  and how they can be parameterized.\n   Within an AF class, a DS node MUST NOT
    forward an IP packet with\n   smaller probability if it contains a drop precedence
    value p than if\n   it contains a drop precedence value q when p < q.  Note that
    this\n   requirement can be fulfilled without needing to dequeue and discard\n
    \  already-queued packets.\n   Within each AF class, a DS node MUST accept all
    three drop precedence\n   codepoints and they MUST yield at least two different
    levels of loss\n   probability.  In some networks, particularly in enterprise
    networks,\n   where transient congestion is a rare and brief occurrence, it may
    be\n   reasonable for a DS node to implement only two different levels of\n   loss
    probability per AF class.  While this may suffice for some\n   networks, three
    different levels of loss probability SHOULD be\n   supported in DS domains where
    congestion is a common occurrence.\n   If a DS node only implements two different
    levels of loss probability\n   for an AF class x, the codepoint AFx1 MUST yield
    the lower loss\n   probability and the codepoints AFx2 and AFx3 MUST yield the
    higher\n   loss probability.\n   A DS node MUST NOT reorder AF packets of the
    same microflow when they\n   belong to the same AF class regardless of their drop
    precedence.\n   There are no quantifiable timing requirements (delay or delay\n
    \  variation) associated with the forwarding of AF packets.\n   The relationship
    between AF classes and other PHBs is described in\n   Section 7 of this memo.\n
    \  The AF PHB group MAY be used to implement both end-to-end and domain\n   edge-to-domain
    edge services.\n"

    the amount of AF\n   traffic that enters or exits the domain at various levels
    of drop\n   precedence.  Such traffic conditioning actions MAY include traffic\n
    \  shaping, discarding of packets, increasing or decreasing the drop\n   precedence
    of packets, and reassigning of packets to other AF\n   classes.  However, the
    traffic conditioning actions MUST NOT cause\n   reordering of packets of the same
    microflow.\n"

  - "4. Queueing and Discard Behavior\n   This section defines the queueing and discard
    behavior of the AF PHB\n   group.  Other aspects of the PHB group's behavior are
    defined in\n   Section 2.\n   An AF implementation MUST attempt to minimize long-term
    congestion\n   within each class, while allowing short-term congestion resulting\n
    \  from bursts. This requires an active queue management algorithm.  An\n   example
    of such an algorithm is Random Early Drop (RED) [Floyd].\n   This memo does not
    specify the use of a particular algorithm, but\n   does require that several properties
    hold.\n   An AF implementation MUST detect and respond to long-term congestion\n
    \  within each class by dropping packets, while handling short-term\n   congestion
    (packet bursts) by queueing packets.  This implies the\n   presence of a smoothing
    or filtering function that monitors the\n   instantaneous congestion level and
    computes a smoothed congestion\n   level.  The dropping algorithm uses this smoothed
    congestion level to\n   determine when packets should be discarded.\n   The dropping
    algorithm MUST be insensitive to the short-term traffic\n   characteristics of
    the microflows using an AF class.  That is, flows\n   with different short-term
    burst shapes but identical longer-term\n   packet rates should have packets discarded
    with essentially equal\n   probability.  One way to achieve this is to use randomness
    within the\n   dropping function.\n   The dropping algorithm MUST treat all packets
    within a single class\n   and precedence level identically.  This implies that
    for any given\n   smoothed congestion level, the discard rate of a particular\n
    \  microflow's packets within a single precedence level will be\n   proportional
    to that flow's percentage of the total amount of traffic\n   passing through that
    precedence level.\n   The congestion indication feedback to the end nodes, and
    thus the\n   level of packet discard at each drop precedence in relation to\n
    \  congestion, MUST be gradual rather than abrupt, to allow the overall\n   system
    to reach a stable operating point.  One way to do this (RED)\n   uses two (configurable)
    smoothed congestion level thresholds.  When\n   the smoothed congestion level
    is below the first threshold, no\n   packets of the relevant precedence are discarded.
    \ When the smoothed\n   congestion level is between the first and the second threshold,\n
    \  packets are discarded with linearly increasing probability, ranging\n   from
    zero to a configurable value reached just prior to the second\n   threshold.  When
    the smoothed congestion level is above the second\n   threshold, packets of the
    relevant precedence are discarded with 100%\n   probability.\n   To allow the
    AF PHB to be used in many different operating\n   environments, the dropping algorithm
    control parameters MUST be\n   independently configurable for each packet drop
    precedence and for\n   each AF class.\n   Within the limits above, this specification
    allows for a range of\n   packet discard behaviors.  Inconsistent discard behaviors
    lead to\n   inconsistent end-to-end service semantics and limit the range of\n
    \  possible uses of the AF PHB in a multi-vendor environment.  As\n   experience
    is gained, future versions of this document may more\n   tightly define specific
    aspects of the desirable behavior.\n"

  - "7. Interactions with Other PHB Groups\n   The AF codepoint mappings recommended
    above do not interfere with the\n   local use spaces nor the Class Selector codepoints
    recommended in\n   [Nichols].  The PHBs selected by those Class Selector codepoints
    may\n   thus coexist with the AF PHB group and retain the forwarding behavior\n
    \  and relationships that was defined for them.  In particular, the\n   Default
    PHB codepoint of '000000' may remain to be used for\n   conventional best effort
    traffic.  Similarly, the codepoints '11x000'\n   may remain to be used for network
    control traffic.\n   The AF PHB group, in conjunction with edge traffic conditioning\n
    \  actions that limit the amount of traffic in each AF class to a\n   (generally
    different) percentage of the class's allocated resources,\n   can be used to obtain
    the overall behavior implied by the Class\n   Selector PHBs.  In this case it
    may be appropriate within a DS domain\n   to use some or all of the Class Selector
    codepoints as aliases of AF\n   codepoints.\n   In addition to the Class Selector
    PHBs, any other PHB groups may co-\n   exist with the AF PHB group within the
    same DS domain.  However, any\n   AF PHB group implementation should document
    the following:\n   (a) Which, if any, other PHB groups may preempt the forwarding\n
    \  resources specifically allocated to each AF PHB class.  This\n   preemption
    MUST NOT happen in normal network operation, but may be\n   appropriate in certain
    unusual situations - for example, the '11x000'\n   codepoint may preempt AF forwarding
    resources, to give precedence to\n   unexpectedly high levels of network control
    traffic when required.\n   (b) How \"excess\" resources are allocated between
    the AF PHB group and\n   other implemented PHB groups.  For example, once the
    minimum\n   allocations are given to each AF class, any remaining resources could\n
    \  be allocated evenly between the AF classes and the Default PHB.  In\n   an
    alternative example, any remaining resources could be allocated to\n   forwarding
    excess AF traffic, with resources devoted to the Default\n   PHB only when all
    AF demand is met.\n   This memo does not specify that any particular relationship
    hold\n   between AF PHB groups and other implemented PHB groups; it requires\n
    \  only that whatever relationship is chosen be documented.\n   Implementations
    MAY allow either or both of these relationships to be\n   configurable.  It is
    expected that this level of configuration\n   flexibility will prove valuable
    to many network administrators.\n"

    attacks, a\n   provider DS domain SHOULD limit the traffic entering the domain
    to\n   the subscribed profiles.  Also, in order to protect a link to a\n   customer
    DS domain from denial of service attacks, the provider DS\n   domain SHOULD allow
    the customer DS domain to specify how the\n   resources of the link are allocated
    to AF packets.  If a service\n   offering requires that traffic marked with an
    AF codepoint be limited\n   by such attributes as source or destination address,
    it is the\n   responsibility of the ingress node in a network to verify validity

  - "Appendix: Example Services\n   The AF PHB group could be used to implement, for
    example, the so-\n   called Olympic service, which consists of three service classes:\n
    \  bronze, silver, and gold.  Packets are assigned to these three\n   classes
    so that packets in the gold class experience lighter load\n   (and thus have greater
    probability for timely forwarding) than\n   packets assigned to the silver class.
    \ Same kind of relationship\n   exists between the silver class and the bronze
    class.  If desired,\n   packets within each class may be further separated by
    giving them\n   either low, medium, or high drop precedence.\n   The bronze, silver,
    and gold service classes could in the network be\n   mapped to the AF classes
    1, 2, and 3.  Similarly, low, medium, and\n   high drop precedence may be mapped
    to AF drop precedence levels 1, 2,\n   or 3.\n   The drop precedence level of
    a packet could be assigned, for example,\n   by using a leaky bucket traffic policer,
    which has as its parameters\n   a rate and a size, which is the sum of two burst
    values: a committed\n   burst size and an excess burst size.  A packet is assigned
    low drop\n   precedence if the number of tokens in the bucket is greater than
    the\n   excess burst size, medium drop precedence if the number of tokens in\n
    \  the bucket is greater than zero, but at most the excess burst size,\n   and
    high drop precedence if the bucket is empty.  It may also be\n   necessary to
    set an upper limit to the amount of high drop precedence\n   traffic from a customer
    DS domain in order to avoid the situation\n   where an avalanche of undeliverable
    high drop precedence packets from\n   one customer DS domain can deny service
    to possibly deliverable high\n   drop precedence packets from other domains.\n
    \  Another way to assign the drop precedence level of a packet could be\n   to
    limit the user traffic of an Olympic service class to a given peak\n   rate and
    distribute it evenly across each level of drop precedence.\n   This would yield
    a proportional bandwidth service, which equally\n   apportions available capacity
    during times of congestion under the\n   assumption that customers with high bandwidth
    microflows have\n   subscribed to higher peak rates than customers with low bandwidth\n
    \  microflows.\n   The AF PHB group could also be used to implement a loss and
    low\n   latency service using an over provisioned AF class, if the maximum\n   arrival
    rate to that class is known a priori in each DS node.\n   Specification of the
    required admission control services, however, is\n   beyond the scope of this
    document.  If low loss is not an objective,\n   a low latency service could be
    implemented without over provisioning\n   by setting a low maximum limit to the
    buffer space available for an\n   AF class.\n"
