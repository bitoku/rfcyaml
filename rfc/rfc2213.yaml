- title: 1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework\n   The SNMPv2 Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of four major\n   components.  They are:\n   o    RFC 1441\
    \ which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for\n        describing and naming\
    \ objects for the purpose of\n        management.\n   o    STD 17, RFC 1213 defines\
    \ MIB-II, the core set of managed\n        objects for the Internet suite of protocols.\n\
    \   o    RFC 1445 which defines the administrative and other\n        architectural\
    \ aspects of the framework.\n   o    RFC 1448 which defines the protocol used\
    \ for network\n        access to managed objects.\n   The Framework permits new\
    \ objects to be defined for the purpose of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Object Definitions
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Object Definitions\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information\
    \ store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB\
    \ are\n   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)\n \
    \  defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an\n   OBJECT\
    \ IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object\n   type together\
    \ with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a\n   specific instantiation\
    \ of the object.  For human convenience, we\n   often use a textual string, termed\
    \ the descriptor, to refer to the\n   object type.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Textual Conventions
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Textual Conventions\n   Several new data types are introduced as a textual\
    \ convention in this\n   MIB document.  These textual conventions enhance the\
    \ readability of\n   the specification and can ease comparison with other specifications\n\
    \   if appropriate.  It should be noted that the introduction of the\n   these\
    \ textual conventions has no effect on either the syntax nor the\n   semantics\
    \ of any managed objects.  The use of these is merely an\n   artifact of the explanatory\
    \ method used.  Objects defined in terms of\n   one of these methods are always\
    \ encoded by means of the rules that\n   define the primitive type.  Hence, no\
    \ changes to the SMI or the SNMP\n   are necessary to accommodate these textual\
    \ conventions which are\n   adopted merely for the convenience of readers and\
    \ writers in pursuit\n   of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous\
    \ MIB documents.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Structure of MIB
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Structure of MIB\n   The MIB is composed of the following sections:\n \
    \       Integrated Services\n             Interface Attributes Table\n       \
    \      Interface Flow Table\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The use of an SNMP SET results in an RSVP or\
    \ Integrated Services\n   reservation under rules that are different compared\
    \ to if the\n   reservation was negotiated using RSVP. However, no other security\n\
    \   considerations exist other than those imposed by SNMP itself.\n"
