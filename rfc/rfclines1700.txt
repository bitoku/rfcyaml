This memo is a status report on the parameters (i.e., numbers and keywords) used in protocols in the Internet community.
Distribution of this memo is unlimited.
This RFC is a snapshot of the ongoing process of the assignment of protocol parameters for the Internet protocol suite.
To make the current information readily available the assignments are kept up to  date in a set of online text files.
This RFC has been assembled by catinating these files together with a minimum of formatting "glue".
The authors appologize for the somewhat rougher formatting and style than is typical of most RFCs.
We expect that various readers will notice specific items that should be corrected.
Please send any specific corrections via email to
<iana@isi.edu>. INTRODUCTION The files in this directory document the currently assigned values for several series of numbers used in network protocol implementations.
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is the central coordinator for the assignment of unique parameter values for Internet protocols.
The IANA is chartered by the Internet Society (ISOC) and the Federal Network Council (FNC) to act as the clearinghouse to assign and coordinate the use of numerous Internet protocol parameters.
The Internet protocol suite, as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its steering group (the IESG), contains numerous parameters, such as internet addresses, domain names, autonomous system numbers (used in some routing protocols), protocol numbers, port numbers, management information base object identifiers, including private enterprise numbers, and many others.
The common use of the Internet protocols by the Internet community requires that the particular values used in these parameter fields be assigned uniquely.
It is the task of the IANA to make those unique assignments as requested and to maintain a registry of the currently assigned values.
Requests for parameter assignments (protocols, ports, etc.) should be sent to
Requests for SNMP network management private enterprise number assignments should be sent to <iana mib@isi.edu>.
The IANA is located at and operated by the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) of the University of Southern California (USC).
If you are developing a protocol or application that will require the use of a link, socket, port, protocol, etc., please contact the IANA to receive a number assignment.

Most of the protocols are documented in the RFC series of notes.
Some of the items listed are undocumented.
Further information on protocols can be found in the memo, "Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1).
The convention in the documentation of Internet Protocols is to express numbers in decimal and to picture data in "big endian" order [COHEN].
That is, fields are described left to right, with the most significant octet on the left and the least significant octet on the right.
The order of transmission of the header and data described in this document is resolved to the octet level.
Whenever a diagram shows a group of octets, the order of transmission of those octets is the normal order in which they are read in English.
For example, in the following diagram the octets are transmitted in the order they are numbered. 0
Whenever an octet represents a numeric quantity the left most bit in the diagram is the high order or most significant bit.
That is, the bit labeled 0 is the most significant bit.
For example, the following diagram represents the value 170 (decimal).
1 2 3 4 5 6 7    1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0    Significance of Bits Similarly, whenever a multi octet field represents a numeric quantity the left most bit of the whole field is the most significant bit.
When a multi octet quantity is transmitted the most significant octet is transmitted first.
There are five classes of IP addresses: Class A through Class E.  Of these, Classes A, B, and C are used for unicast addresses, Class D is used for multicast addresses, and Class E addresses are reserved for future use.
With the advent of classless addressing [CIDR1, CIDR2], the network number part of an address may be of any length, and the whole notion of address classes becomes less important.
There are certain special cases for IP addresses.
<Subnet number>, <Host number> }
if we also use the notation " 1" to mean the field contains all 1 bits.
Some common special cases are as follows:
This host on this network.
Can only be used as a source address (see note later).
Can only be used as a source address.
{  1,  1} Limited broadcast.
Can only be used as a destination address, and a datagram with this address must never be forwarded outside the (sub )net of the source.
} Directed broadcast to specified network.
Can only be used as a destination address.
{<Network number>, <Subnet number>,  1
} Directed broadcast to specified subnet.
Can only be used as a destination address.
} Directed broadcast to all subnets of specified subnetted network.
Can only be used as a destination address.
{127, <any>} Internal host loopback address.
Should never appear outside a host.

Well Known Ports are controlled and assigned by the IANA and on most systems can only be used by system (or root) processes or by programs executed by privileged users.
Ports are used in the TCP [RFC793] to name the ends of logical connections which carry long term conversations.
For the purpose of providing services to unknown callers, a service contact port is defined.
This list specifies the port used by the server process as its contact port.
The contact port is sometimes called the "well known port".
To the extent possible, these same port assignments are used with the UDP [RFC768].
The assigned ports use a small portion of the possible port numbers.
For many years the assigned ports were in the range 0 255.
Recently, the range for assigned ports managed by the IANA has been expanded to the range 0 1023.

The Registered Ports are not controlled by the IANA and on most systems can be used by ordinary user processes or programs executed by ordinary users.
Ports are used in the TCP [RFC793] to name the ends of logical connections which carry long term conversations.
For the purpose of providing services to unknown callers, a service contact port is defined.
This list specifies the port used by the server process as its contact port.
While the IANA can not control uses of these ports it does register or list uses of these ports as a convienence to the community.
To the extent possible, these same port assignments are used with the UDP [RFC768].
The Registered Ports are in the range 1024 65535.

To obtain SUN Remote Procedure Call (RPC) numbers send an e mail request to "rpc@sun.com".
The RPC port management service ('portmap' in SunOS versions less than 5.0 and 'rpcbind' in SunOS versions greater than 5.0)
"registers" the IP port number that is allocated to a particular service when that service is created.
It does not allocate ports on behalf of those services.
For an exact specification of the semantics refer to the source code of svcudp create() and svctcp create() in the archives.
In short however is that these interfaces, and svc tli create their Transport Independent RPC equivalent, take either a user specified port number or RPC ANY ( 1) which effectively means "I don't care."
In the "I don't care" case the create code simply calls socket(2) or t open(3n)
which allocates an IP port based on the rules: if euid of the requesting process is 0 (i.e., root) allocate the next available port number in the reserved port range.
else allocate the next available port in the non reserved range.
Port numbers count up sequentially.
Can a port that is "assigned" can be used when the assignee's service is not present?
Say port 501 is assigned to the "jeans" service.
On a machine that does not have the "jeans" service, nor has any clients that might be expecting to use it, is port 501 available for other uses?
Any dynamic allocation process, like the portmapper, that chooses the next unused port might allocate port 501 dynamically to a process that asked for a "I don't care" port.
So any dynamic allocation scheme may pick an unused port that happened to correspond to a port number that had been "assigned" but was currently unused.
While it might be desirable, it is impossible to guarantee that any unused port, even though officially assigned to a service, is not picked by a dynamic allocator since such an assignment might occur long after the delivery of the system into a site that doesn't watch for the latest list.
There is the restriction that only "superuser" on BSD derived systems such as SunOS can bind to a port number that is less than 1024.
So programs have used this information in the past to identify whether or not the service they were talking to was started by the superuser on the remote system.
Making this assumption is dangerous because not all system enforce this restriction.
Sun RPC services use ports that are currently unused.
If someone noted that an RPC service was using port 781, it would be just as happy using port 891, or 951.
The service doesn't care what port it gets, remote clients will query the portmapper to ask it what port number was assigned to the service when it was started.
The key is that the port was not currently in use.
The only port that ONC/RPC must have is 111 its assigned port for the portmap service.
The most common complaint comes when people put a new service on their system.
When they configure their systems they put the new service configuration commands at the end of their system startup scripts.
During startup, several network services may be started.
Those services that are ONC/RPC based just pick the next available port, those that have pre assigned ports bind to their pre assigned port.
Clearly the correct sequence is to have all services that need a particular port to be started first (or if they are "latent" services that are started by inetd, to have inetd started).
Finally, the RPC services should be started as they will be assigned unused ports.
(In the BSD networking code (which we use) the algorithm for picking ports is in the file in pcb.c, function in pcbbind().)
Services should be started in this order: a) Services that will "run" continuously and have an assigned port.
Note that this includes rpcbind (nee portmap) that has port 111 assigned to it.
b) inetd which will automatically create sockets for those services that have reserved ports but only run on demand (like finger) c) RPC services which will automatically pick unused ports and maximize efficiency of the "IP Port" namespace.
/include/netinet/in.h defines a constant IPPORT RESERVED to be 1024.
IPPORT RESERVED are reserved for   privileged processes (e.g. root).
> IPPORT USERRESERVED are reserved   for servers, not necessarily privileged.
Portmap does not allocate ports, the kernel allocates ports.
The code that does this is part of nearly every UNIX system in the world (and since the BSD code is 'free'
it is often the same code).
RPC services ask the kernel to allocate them a port by calling the "bind()" system call.
The parameter they pass is "INADDR ANY" which means "allocate me any IP port you want".
The kernel does that by looking at all of the ports that are currently in use and picking one that is not currently used.
The number picked is either less that 1024 if the process is privledged, or greater than 1024 if the process is not privledged.
After the kernel has allocated a port, the service registers this allocation with portmap.
The portmapper is merely a registry of previously allocated ports.
Note "allocated" here is being used in the sense that they are used by an open socket, not assigned a well known name.
The role of /etc/services is to provide an idea to people who are looking at network traffic as to where a packet may have originated from or is headed to.
For services like finger that have assigned ports, they can just hard code the port they want into their executable.
(it isn't like it will change, and if they read it from /etc/services and someone had mistyped the port number it won't interoperate with clients anyway!)
It is not practical to read the /etc/services file into the kernel to prevent it from giving out port numbers that are "pre assigned", nor is it generally desirable since with the correct ordering of startup it is completely unneccesary.

[] URL   ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in notes/iana/assignments/sun rpc numbers IP OPTION NUMBERS
The Internet Protocol (IP) has provision for optional header fields identified by an option type field.
Options 0 and 1 are exactly one octet which is their type field.
All other options have their one octet type field, followed by a one octet length field, followed by length 2 octets of option data.
The option type field is sub divided into a one bit copied flag, a two bit class field, and a five bit option number.
These taken together form an eight bit value for the option type field.
IP options are commonly refered to by this value.
Copy Class Number Value Name
137 SSR    Strict Source Route
205 FINN   Experimental Flow Control
The current recommended default time to live (TTL) for the Internet Protocol (IP) [45,105] is 64.
This documents the default Type of Service values that are currently recommended for the most important Internet protocols.
The TOS value is used to indicate "better".
Only one TOS value or property can be requested in any one IP datagram.
Generally, protocols which are involved in direct interaction with a human should select low delay, while data transfers which may involve large blocks of data are need high throughput.
Finally, high reliability is most important for datagram based Internet management functions.
Application protocols not included in these tables should be able to make appropriate choice of low delay (8 decimal, 1000 binary) or high throughput (4 decimal, 0100 binary).
The following are recommended values for TOS:   Type of Service Value   Protocol
(1) Includes all interactive user protocols (e.g., rlogin).
(2) Includes all bulk data transfer protocols (e.g., rcp).
If the implementation does not support changing the TOS during the lifetime of the connection, then the recommended TOS on opening the connection is the default TOS (0000).
Although ICMP request messages are normally sent with the default TOS, there are sometimes good reasons why they would be sent with some other TOS value.
An ICMP response always uses the same TOS value as was used in the corresponding ICMP request message.
An application may (at the request of the user) substitute 0001 (minimize monetary cost) for any of the above values.

[] URL   ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in notes/iana/assignments/character sets NETWORK MANAGEMENT PARAMETERS
For the management of hosts and gateways on the Internet a data structure for the information has been defined.
This data structure should be used with any of several possible management protocols, such as the "Simple Network Management Protocol" (SNMP) [RFC1157], or the "Common Management Information Protocol over TCP" (CMOT)
The data structure is the "Structure and Indentification of Management Information for TCP/IP based Internets" (SMI)
[RFC1155], and the "Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP based Internets" (MIB II) [RFC1213].
The SMI includes the provision for panrameters or codes to indicate experimental or private data structures.
These parameter assignments are listed here.
The older "Simple Gateway Monitoring Protocol" (SGMP)
[RFC1028] also defined a data structure.
The parameter assignments used with SGMP are included here for historical completeness.
The network management object identifiers are under the iso (1), org (3), dod (6), internet (1), or 1.3.6.1, branch of the name space.
[IANA] SMI Network Management MGMT Codes:
Frame Relay DCE 45   v35
Inter Carrier Interface Protocol 53   propVirtual

assocApplicationProtocol OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX OBJECT
IDENTIFIER MAX ACCESS read only STATUS current DESCRIPTION "
An identification of the protocol being used for the application.
For an OSI Application, this will be the Application Context.
For Internet applications, the IANA maintains a registry of the OIDs which correspond to well known applications.
If the application protocol is not listed in the registry, an OID value of the form {applTCPProtoID port} or {applUDProtoID port} are used for TCP based and UDP based protocols, respectively.
OIDs of the form {applTCPProtoID port} are intended to be used   for TCP based protocols that don't have OIDs assigned by other   means.
{applUDPProtoID port} serves the same purpose for   UDP based protocols.
In either case 'port' corresponds to   the primary port number being used by the protocol.
For example,   assuming no other OID is assigned for SMTP, an OID of   {applTCPProtoID 25} could be used, since SMTP is a TCP based   protocol that uses port 25 as its primary port.
IDENTIFIER MAX ACCESS read only STATUS current DESCRIPTION "
An identification of the protocol being used by this group.
For an group employing OSI protocols, this will be the Application Context.
For Internet applications, the IANA maintains a registry of the OIDs which correspond to well known message transfer protocols.
If the application protocol is not listed in the registry, an OID value of the form {applTCPProtoID port} or {applUDProtoID port} are used for TCP based and UDP based protocols, respectively.
In either case 'port' corresponds to the primary port number being used by the group.
applTCPProtoID and applUDPProtoID are defined in [5]."

Some of the networks of all classes are IEEE 802 Networks.
These systems may use a Link Service Access Point (LSAP) field in much the same way the MILNET uses the "link" field.
Further, there is an extension of the LSAP header called the Sub Network Access Protocol (SNAP).
The IEEE likes to describe numbers in binary in bit transmission order, which is the opposite of the big endian order used throughout the Internet protocol documentation.
Assignments: Link Service Access Point
These numbers (and others) are assigned by the IEEE Standards Office.
The address is: IEEE Registration Authority c/o Iris Ringel IEEE Standards
The fee is $1000 and it takes 10 working days after receipt of the request form and fee.
They will not do anything via fax or phone.
At an ad hoc special session on "IEEE 802 Networks and ARP", held during the TCP Vendors Workshop (August 1986), an approach to a consistent way to send DoD IP datagrams and other IP related protocols (such as the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)) on 802 networks was developed, using the SNAP extension (see [RFC1042]).

The standard for transmission of IP datagrams over Ethernets and Experimental Ethernets is specified in [RFC894] and [RFC895] respectively.
Ethernet 48 bit address blocks are assigned by the IEEE.
/o Iris Ringel IEEE Standards Department 445 Hoes Lane,
Fax:  1 908 562 1571 IANA ETHERNET ADDRESS BLOCK
The IANA owns an Ethernet address block which may be used for multicast address asignments or other special purposes.
The address block in IEEE binary is:  0000 0000 0000 0000 0111 1010
In the normal Internet dotted decimal notation this is 0.0.94 since the bytes are transmitted higher order first and bits within bytes are transmitted lower order first (see "Data Notation" in the Introduction).
IEEE CSMA/CD and Token Bus bit transmission order: 00 00 5E IEEE Token Ring bit transmission order: 00 00
Assigned by IANA for other uses Appearance in memory (bits transmitted right to left within octets, octets transmitted left to right):
Assigned by IANA for other uses
The latter representation corresponds to the Internet standard bit order, and is the format that most programmers have to deal with.
Using this representation, the range of Internet Multicast addresses is: 01 00 5E 00 00 00  to  01 00 5E 7F FF FF  in hex, or 1.0.94.0.0.0  to  1.0.94.127.255.255  in dotted decimal ETHERNET VENDOR ADDRESS COMPONENTS Ethernet hardware addresses are 48 bits, expressed as 12 hexadecimal digits (0 9, plus A F, capitalized).
These 12 hex digits consist of the first/left 6 digits (which should match the vendor of the Ethernet interface within the station) and the last/right 6 digits which specify the interface serial number for that interface vendor.
Ethernet addresses might be written unhyphenated (e.g., 123456789ABC), or with one hyphen (e.g., 123456 789ABC), but should be written hyphenated by octets (e.g., 12 34 56 78 9A BC).
These addresses are physical station addresses, not multicast nor broadcast, so the second hex digit (reading from the left) will be even, not odd.
At present, it is not clear how the IEEE assigns Ethernet block addresses.
Whether in blocks of 2  24 or 2  25, and whether multicasts are assigned with that block or separately.
A portion of the vendor block address is reportedly assigned serially, with the other portion intentionally assigned randomly.
If there is a global algorithm for which addresses are designated to be physical (in a chipset) versus logical (assigned in software), or globally assigned versus locally assigned addresses, some of the known addresses do not follow the scheme (e.g., AA0003; 02xxxx).

An Ethernet multicast address consists of the multicast bit, the 23 bit vendor component, and the 24 bit group identifier assigned by the vendor.
For example, DEC is assigned the vendor component 08 00 2B, so multicast addresses assigned by DEC have the first 24 bits 09 00 2B (since the multicast bit is the low order bit of the first byte, which is "the first bit on the wire").

The word "link" here refers to a field in the original MILNET Host/IMP interface leader.
The link was originally defined as an 8 bit field.
Later specifications defined this field as the "message id" with a length of 12 bits.
The name link now refers to the high order 8 bits of this 12 bit message
The Host/IMP interface is defined in BBN Report 1822 [BBN1822].
The low order 4 bits of the message
id field are called the sub link.
Unless explicitly specified otherwise for a particular protocol, there is no sender to receiver significance to the sub link.
The sender may use the sub link in any way he chooses (it is returned in the RFNM by the destination IMP), the receiver should ignore the sub link.
The MILNET facility for "logical addressing" is described in [RFC878] and [RFC1005].
A portion of the possible logical addresses are reserved for standard uses.
There are 49,152 possible logical host addresses.
Of these, 256 are reserved for assignment to well known functions.
Assignments for well known functions are made by the IANA.
Assignments for other logical host addresses are made by the NIC.
All MILNET hosts are assigned addresses by the Defense Data Network (DDN).
The address of a MILNET host may be obtained from the Network Information Center (NIC), represented as an ASCII text string in what is called "host table format".
This section describes the process by which MILNET X.25 addresses may be derived from addresses in the NIC host table format.
A NIC host table address consists of the ASCII text string representations of four decimal numbers separated by periods, corresponding to the four octeted of a thirty two bit Internet address.
The four decimal numbers are referred to in this section as "n", "h' "l", and "i".
Thus, a host table address may be represented as: "n.h.l.i".
Each of these four numbers will have either one, two, or three decimal digits and will never have a value greater than 255.
For example, in the host table, address: "10.2.0.124", n 10, h 2, l 0, and i 124.
To convert a host table address to a MILNET X.25 address: 1.
If h < 64, the host table address corresponds to the X.25 physical address: ZZZZ F IIIHHZZ (SS)
In the example given above, the host table address 10.2.0.124 corresponds to the X.25 physical address 000001240200.
If h > 64 or
h   64, the host table address corresponds to the X.25 logical address
(Note that the decimal representation of "r" will always require five digits);
Thus, the host table address 10.83.0.207 corresponds to the X.25 logical address 000012145500.
In both cases, the "n" and "l" fields of the host table address are not used.

INTERNET / XNS PROTOCOL MAPPINGS Below are two tables describing the arrangement of protocol fields or type field assignments so that one could send XNS Datagrams on the MILNET or Internet Datagrams on 10Mb Ethernet, and also protocol and type fields so one could encapsulate each kind of Datagram in the other.

Below is the current list of PRONET 80 Type Numbers.
a protocol that is on this list does not necessarily mean that there is any implementation of it on ProNET.
Of these, protocols 1, 14, and 20 are the only ones that have ever been seen in ARP packets.
For reference, the header is (one byte/line): destination hardware address source hardware address data link header version (2) data link header protocol number data link header reserved (0) data link header reserved (0)
Some protocols have been known to tuck stuff in the reserved fields.
Those who need a protocol number on ProNET 10/80 should contact John Shriver (jas@proteon.com).

ASSIGNMENTS PPP DLL PROTOCOL NUMBERS
The Point to Point Protocol (PPP) Data Link Layer [146,147,175] contains a 16 bit Protocol field to identify the the encapsulated protocol.
The Protocol field is consistent with the ISO 3309 (HDLC) extension mechanism for Address fields.
All Protocols MUST be assigned such that the least significant bit of the most significant octet equals "0", and the least significant bit of the least significant octet equals "1".
Assigned PPP DLL Protocol Numbers Value (in hex)
Fujitsu Link Backup and Load Balancing (LBLB)
compression on single link in multilink group 00fd
IBM Source Routing BPDU 0205
Multi Link Control Protocol 803f
NETBIOS Framing Control Protocol 807d
SNA over 802.2 Control Protocol 804d
IP6 Header Compression Control Protocol 006f
Stampede Bridging Control Protocol 80cf
It is recommended that values in the "02xx" to "1exx" and "xx01" to "xx1f" ranges not be assigned, as they are compression inefficient.
Protocol field values in the "4xxx" to "7xxx" range are used for protocols with low volume traffic which have no associated NCP.
Protocol field values in the "cxxx" to "exxx" range identify datagrams as Control Protocols (such as LCP).
PPP LCP AND IPCP CODES
The Point to Point Protocol (PPP) Link Control Protocol (LCP),
[146] the Compression Control Protocol (CCP), Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP), [147] and other control protocols, contain an 8 bit Code field which identifies the type of packet.
These Codes are assigned as follows:
