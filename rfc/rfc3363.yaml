- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF had begun the process of standardizing two different\
    \ address\n   formats for IPv6 addresses AAAA [RFC1886] and A6 [RFC2874] and both\n\
    \   are at proposed standard.  This had led to confusion and conflicts on\n  \
    \ which one to deploy.  It is important for deployment that any\n   confusion\
    \ in this area be cleared up, as there is a feeling in the\n   community that\
    \ having more than one choice will lead to delays in the\n   deployment of IPv6.\
    \  The goal of this document is to clarify the\n   situation.\n   This document\
    \ also discusses issues relating to the usage of Binary\n   Labels [RFC 2673]\
    \ to support the reverse mapping of IPv6 addresses.\n   This document is based\
    \ on extensive technical discussion on various\n   relevant working groups mailing\
    \ lists and a joint DNSEXT and NGTRANS\n   meeting at the 51st IETF in August\
    \ 2001.  This document attempts to\n   capture the sense of the discussions and\
    \ reflect them in this\n   document to represent the consensus of the community.\n\
    \   The main arguments and the issues are covered in a separate document\n   [RFC3364]\
    \ that reflects the current understanding of the issues.\n   This document summarizes\
    \ the outcome of these discussions.\n   The issue of the root of reverse IPv6\
    \ address map is outside the\n   scope of this document and is covered in a different\
    \ document\n   [RFC3152].\n"

- title: '2.  IPv6 Addresses: AAAA RR vs A6 RR'
  contents:
  - "2.  IPv6 Addresses: AAAA RR vs A6 RR\n   Working group consensus as perceived\
    \ by the chairs of the DNSEXT and\n   NGTRANS working groups is that:\n   a) AAAA\
    \ records are preferable at the moment for production\n      deployment of IPv6,\
    \ and\n   b) that A6 records have interesting properties that need to be better\n\
    \      understood before deployment.\n   c) It is not known if the benefits of\
    \ A6 outweigh the costs and\n      risks.\n"
- title: 2.1 Rationale
  contents:
  - "2.1 Rationale\n   There are several potential issues with A6 RRs that stem directly\n\
    \   from the feature that makes them different from AAAA RRs: the ability\n  \
    \ to build up addresses via chaining.\n   Resolving a chain of A6 RRs involves\
    \ resolving a series of what are\n   nearly-independent queries.  Each of these\
    \ sub-queries takes some\n   non-zero amount of time, unless the answer happens\
    \ to be in the\n   resolver's local cache already.  Other things being equal,\
    \ we expect\n   that the time it takes to resolve an N-link chain of A6 RRs will\
    \ be\n   roughly proportional to N.  What data we have suggests that users are\n\
    \   already impatient with the length of time it takes to resolve A RRs\n   in\
    \ the IPv4 Internet, which suggests that users are not likely to be\n   patient\
    \ with significantly longer delays in the IPv6 Internet, but\n   terminating queries\
    \ prematurely is both a waste of resources and\n   another source of user frustration.\
    \  Thus, we are forced to conclude\n   that indiscriminate use of long A6 chains\
    \ is likely to lead to\n   increased user frustration.\n   The probability of\
    \ failure during the process of resolving an N-link\n   A6 chain also appears\
    \ to be roughly proportional to N, since each of\n   the queries involved in resolving\
    \ an A6 chain has roughly the same\n   probability of failure as a single AAAA\
    \ query.\n   Last, several of the most interesting potential applications for\
    \ A6\n   RRs involve situations where the prefix name field in the A6 RR\n   points\
    \ to a target that is not only outside the DNS zone containing\n   the A6 RR,\
    \ but is administered by a different organization entirely.\n   While pointers\
    \ out of zone are not a problem per se, experience both\n   with glue RRs and\
    \ with PTR RRs in the IN-ADDR.ARPA tree suggests that\n   pointers to other organizations\
    \ are often not maintained properly,\n   perhaps because they're less susceptible\
    \ to automation than pointers\n   within a single organization would be.\n"
- title: 2.2 Recommended Standard Action
  contents:
  - "2.2 Recommended Standard Action\n   Based on the perceived consensus, this document\
    \ recommends that RFC\n   1886 stay on standards track and be advanced, while\
    \ moving RFC 2874\n   to Experimental status.\n"
- title: 3.  Bitlabels in the Reverse DNS Tree
  contents:
  - "3.  Bitlabels in the Reverse DNS Tree\n   RFC 2673 defines a new DNS label type.\
    \  This was the first new type\n   defined since RFC 1035 [RFC1035].  Since the\
    \ development of 2673 it\n   has been learned that deployment of a new type is\
    \ difficult since DNS\n   servers that do not support bitlabels reject queries\
    \ containing bit\n   labels as being malformed.  The community has also indicated\
    \ that\n   this new label type is not needed for mapping reverse addresses.\n"
- title: 3.1 Rationale
  contents:
  - "3.1 Rationale\n   The hexadecimal text representation of IPv6 addresses appears\
    \ to be\n   capable of expressing all of the delegation schemes that we expect\
    \ to\n   be used in the DNS reverse tree.\n"
- title: 3.2 Recommended Standard Action
  contents:
  - "3.2 Recommended Standard Action\n   RFC 2673 standard status is to be changed\
    \ from Proposed to\n   Experimental.  Future standardization of these documents\
    \ is to be\n   done by the DNSEXT working group or its successor.\n"
- title: 4.  DNAME in IPv6 Reverse Tree
  contents:
  - "4.  DNAME in IPv6 Reverse Tree\n   The issues for DNAME in the reverse mapping\
    \ tree appears to be\n   closely tied to the need to use fragmented A6 in the\
    \ main tree: if\n   one is necessary, so is the other, and if one isn't necessary,\
    \ the\n   other isn't either.  Therefore, in moving RFC 2874 to experimental,\n\
    \   the intent of this document is that use of DNAME RRs in the reverse\n   tree\
    \ be deprecated.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   As this document specifies a course of action,\
    \ there are no direct\n   security considerations.  There is an indirect security\
    \ impact of the\n   choice, in that the relationship between A6 and DNSSEC is\
    \ not well\n   understood throughout the community, while the choice of AAAA does\n\
    \   leads to a model for use of DNSSEC in IPv6 networks which parallels\n   current\
    \ IPv4 practice.\n"
