- title: 2. Terminology
  contents:
  - "2. Terminology\n   It is well understood that in computer networks, the concepts\
    \ of\n   directories, names, network addresses, and routes are separate and\n\
    \   must be analysed separately [RFC 1498].  However, it is also\n   necessary\
    \ to sub-divide the concept of \"network address\" (abbreviated\n   to \"address\"\
    \ from here on) into at least two notions, namely\n   \"identifier\" and \"locator\"\
    . This was perhaps less well understood\n   when RFC 791 was written.\n   In this\
    \ document, the term \"host\" refers to any system originating\n   and/or terminating\
    \ IPv4 packets, and \"router\" refers to any system\n   forwarding IPv4 packets\
    \ from one host or router to another.\n   For the purposes of this document, an\
    \ \"identifier\" is a bit string\n   which is used throughout the lifetime of\
    \ a communication session\n   between two hosts, to identify one of the hosts\
    \ as far as the other\n   is concerned. Such an identifier is used to verify the\
    \ source of\n   incoming packets as being truly the other end of the communication\n\
    \   concerned, e.g. in the TCP pseudo-header [RFC 793] or in an IP\n   Security\
    \ association [RFC 1825].  Traditionally, the source IPv4\n   address in every\
    \ packet is used for this.\n   Note that other definitions of \"identifier\" are\
    \ sometimes used; this\n   document does not claim to discuss the general issue\
    \ of the semantics\n   of end-point identifiers.\n   For the purposes of this\
    \ document, a \"locator\" is a bit string which\n   is used to identify where\
    \ a particular packet must be delivered, i.e.\n   it serves to locate the place\
    \ in the Internet topology where the\n   destination host is attached. Traditionally,\
    \ the destination IPv4\n   address in every packet is used for this. IP routing\
    \ protocols\n   interpret IPv4 addresses as locators and construct routing tables\n\
    \   based on which routers (which have their own locators) claim to know\n   a\
    \ route towards the locators of particular hosts.\n   Both identifiers and locators\
    \ have requirements of uniqueness, but\n   these requirements are different. Identifiers\
    \ must be unique with\n   respect to each set of inter-communicating hosts. Locators\
    \ must be\n   unique with respect to each set of inter-communicating routers (which\n\
    \   we will call a routing \"realm\"). While locators must be unique within\n\
    \   a given routing realm, this uniqueness (but not routability) could\n   extend\
    \ to more than one realm.  Thus we can further distinguish\n   between a set of\
    \ realms with unique locators versus a set of realms\n   with non-unique (overlapping)\
    \ locators.\n   Both identifiers and locators have requirements of lifetime, but\n\
    \   these requirements are different. Identifiers must be valid for at\n   least\
    \ the maximum lifetime of a communication between two hosts.\n   Locators must\
    \ be valid only as long as the routing mechanisms so\n   require (which could\
    \ be shorter or longer than the lifetime of a\n   communication).\n   It will\
    \ be noted that it is a contingent fact of history that the\n   same address space\
    \ and the same fields in the IP header (source and\n   destination addresses)\
    \ are used by RFC 791 and RFC 793 for both\n   identifiers and locators, and that\
    \ in the traditional Internet a\n   host's identifier is identical to its locator,\
    \ as well as being\n   spatially unique (unambiguous) and temporally unique (constant).\n\
    \   These uniqueness conditions had a number of consequences for design\n   assumptions\
    \ of routing (the infrastructure that IPv4 locators enable)\n   and transport\
    \ protocols (that which depends on the IP connectivity).\n   Spatial uniqueness\
    \ of an address meant that it served as both an\n   interface identifier and a\
    \ host identifier, as well as the key to the\n   routing table.  Temporal uniqueness\
    \ of an address meant that there\n   was no need for TCP implementations to maintain\
    \ state regarding\n   identity of the far end, other than the IP address. Thus\
    \ IP addresses\n   could be used both for end-to-end IP security and for binding\
    \ upper\n   layer sessions.\n   Generally speaking, the use of IPv4 addresses\
    \ as locators has been\n   considered more important than their use as identifiers,\
    \ and whenever\n   there has been a conflict between the two uses, the use as\
    \ a locator\n   has prevailed. That is, it has been considered more useful to\
    \ deliver\n   the packet, then worry about how to identify the end points, than\
    \ to\n   provide identity in a packet that cannot be delivered. In other\n   words,\
    \ there has been intensive work on routing protocols and little\n   concrete work\
    \ on other aspects of address usage.\n"
- title: 3. Ideal properties.
  contents:
  - "3. Ideal properties.\n   Whatever the constraints mentioned above, it is easy\
    \ to see the ideal\n   properties of identifiers and locators. Identifiers should\
    \ be\n   assigned at birth, never change, and never be re-used. Locators\n   should\
    \ describe the host's position in the network's topology, and\n   should change\
    \ whenever the topology changes.\n   Unfortunately neither of the these ideals\
    \ are met by IPv4 addresses.\n   The remainder of this document is intended as\
    \ a snapshot of the\n   current real situation.\n"
- title: 4. Overview of the current situation of IPv4 addresses.
  contents:
  - "4. Overview of the current situation of IPv4 addresses.\n   It is a fact that\
    \ IPv4 addresses are no longer all globally unique\n   and no longer all have\
    \ indefinite lifetimes.\n   4.1 Addresses are no longer globally unique locators\n\
    \      [RFC 1918] shows how corporate networks, a.k.a. Intranets, may if\n   \
    \   necessary legitimately re-use a subset of the IPv4 address space,\n      forming\
    \ multiple routing realms. At the boundary between two (or\n      more) routing\
    \ realms, we may find a spectrum of devices that\n      enables communication\
    \ between the realms.\n      At one end of the spectrum is a pure Application\
    \ Layer Gateway\n      (ALG). Such a device acts as a termination point for the\n\
    \      application layer data stream, and is visible to an end-user.  For\n  \
    \    example, when an end-user Ua in routing realm A wants to\n      communicate\
    \ with an end-user Ub in routing realm B, Ua has first\n      to explicitly establish\
    \ communication with the ALG that\n      interconnects A and B, and only via that\
    \ can Ua establish\n      communication with Ub. We term such a gateway a \"non-transparent\"\
    \n      ALG.\n      Another form of ALG makes communication through the ALG\n\
    \      transparent to an end user. Using the previous example, with a\n      \"\
    transparent\" ALG, Ua would not be required to establish explicit\n      connectivity\
    \ to the ALG first, before starting to communicate with\n      Ub. Such connectivity\
    \ will be established transparently to Ua, so\n      that Ua would only see connectivity\
    \ to Ub.\n      For completeness, note that it is not necessarily the case that\n\
    \      communicating via an ALG involves changes to the network header.\n    \
    \  An ALG could be used only at the beginning of a session for the\n      purpose\
    \ of authentication, after which the ALG goes away and\n      communication continues\
    \ natively.\n      Both non-transparent and transparent ALGs are required (by\n\
    \      definition) to understand the syntax and semantics of the\n      application\
    \ data stream.  ALGs are very simple from the viewpoint\n      of network layer\
    \ architecture, since they appear as Internet hosts\n      in each realm, i.e.\
    \ they act as origination and termination points\n      for communication.\n \
    \     At the other end of the spectrum is a Network Address Translator\n     \
    \ (NAT) [RFC 1631]. In the context of this document we define a NAT\n      as\
    \ a device that just modifies the network and the transport layer\n      headers,\
    \ but does not understand the syntax/semantics of the\n      application layer\
    \ data stream (using our terminology what is\n      described in RFC1631 is a\
    \ device that has both the NAT and ALG\n      functionality).\n      In the standard\
    \ case of a NAT placed between a corporate network\n      using private addresses\
    \ [RFC 1918] and the public Internet, that\n      NAT changes the source IPv4\
    \ address in packets going towards the\n      Internet, and changes the destination\
    \ IPv4 address in packets\n      coming from the Internet.  When a NAT is used\
    \ to interconnect\n      routing realms with overlapping addresses, such as a\
    \ direct\n      connection between two intranets, the NAT may modify both\n  \
    \    addresses in the IP header.  Since the NAT modifies address(es) in\n    \
    \  the IP header, the NAT also has to modify the transport (e.g.,\n      TCP,\
    \ UDP) pseudo-header checksum.  Upon some introspection one\n      could observe\
    \  that  when interconnecting routing realms with\n      overlapping addresses,\
    \ the set of operations on the network and\n      transport header performed by\
    \ a NAT forms a (proper) subset of the\n      set of operations on the network\
    \ and transport layer performed by\n      a transparent ALG.\n      By definition\
    \ a NAT does not understand syntax and semantics of an\n      application data\
    \ stream. Therefore, a NAT cannot support\n      applications that carry IP addresses\
    \ at the application layer\n      (e.g., FTP with PORT or PASV command [RFC 959]).\
    \ On the other\n      hand, a NAT can support any application, as long as such\
    \ an\n      application does not carry IP addresses at the application layer.\n\
    \      This is in contrast with an ALG that can support only the\n      applications\
    \ coded into the ALG.\n      One can conclude that both NATs and ALGs have their\
    \ own\n      limitations, which could constrain their usefulness. Combining NAT\n\
    \      and ALG functionality in a single device could be used to overcome\n  \
    \    some, but not all, of these limitations.  Such a device would use\n     \
    \ the NAT functionality for the applications that do not carry IP\n      addresses,\
    \ and would resort to the ALG functionality when dealing\n      with the applications\
    \ that carry IP addresses. For example, such a\n      device would use the NAT\
    \ functionality to deal with the FTP data\n      connection, but would use the\
    \ ALG functionality to deal with the\n      FTP control connection.  However,\
    \ such a device will fail\n      completely handling an application that carries\
    \ IP addresses, when\n      the device does not support the application via the\
    \ ALG\n      functionality, but rather handles it via the NAT functionality.\n\
    \      Communicating through either ALGs or NATs involves changes to the\n   \
    \   network header (and specifically source and destination\n      addresses),\
    \ and to the transport header. Since IP Security\n      authentication headers\
    \ assume that the addresses in the network\n      header are preserved end-to-end,\
    \ it is not clear how one could\n      support IP Security-based authentication\
    \ between a pair of hosts\n      communicating through either an ALG or a NAT.\
    \ Since IP Security,\n      when used for confidentiality, encrypts the entire\
    \ transport layer\n      end-to-end, it is not clear how an ALG or NAT could modify\n\
    \      encrypted packets as they require to.  In other words, both ALGs\n    \
    \  and NATs are likely to force a boundary between two distinct IP\n      Security\
    \ domains, both for authentication and for confidentiality,\n      unless specific\
    \ enhancements to IP Security are designed for this\n      purpose.\n      Interconnecting\
    \ routing realms via either ALGs or NATs relies on\n      the DNS [RFC 1035].\
    \  Specifically, for a given set of\n      (interconnected) routing realms, even\
    \ if network layer addresses\n      are no longer unique across the set, fully\
    \ qualified domain names\n      would need to be unique across the set. However,\
    \ a site that is\n      running a NAT or ALG probably needs to run two DNS servers,\
    \ one\n      inside and one outside the NAT or ALG, giving different answers to\n\
    \      identical queries. This is discussed further in [kre].  DNS\n      security\
    \ [RFC 2065] and some dynamic DNS updates [dns2] will\n      presumably not be\
    \ valid across a NAT/ALG boundary, so we must\n      assume that the external\
    \ DNS server acquires at least part of its\n      tables by some other mechanism.\n\
    \      To summarize, since RFC 1918, we have not really changed the\n      spatial\
    \ uniqueness of an address, so much as recognized that there\n      are multiple\
    \ spaces. i.e.  each space is still a routing realm\n      such as an intranet,\
    \ possibly connected to other intranets, or the\n      Internet, by NATs or ALGs\
    \ (see above discussion). The temporal\n      uniqueness of an address is unchanged\
    \ by RFC 1918.\n   4.2. Addresses are no longer all temporally unique\n      Note\
    \ that as soon as address significance changes anywhere in the\n      address\
    \ space, it has in some sense changed everywhere. This has\n      in fact already\
    \ happened.\n      IPv4 address blocks were for many years assigned chronologically,\n\
    \      i.e.  effectively at random with respect to network topology.\n      This\
    \ led to constantly growing routing tables; this does not\n      scale. Today,\
    \ hierarchical routing (CIDR [RFC 1518], [RFC 1519])\n      is used as a mechanism\
    \ to improve scaling of routing within a\n      routing realm, and especially\
    \ within the Internet (The Annex goes\n      into more details on CIDR).\n   \
    \   Scaling capabilities of CIDR are based on the assumption that\n      address\
    \ allocation reflects network topology as much as possible,\n      and boundaries\
    \ for aggregation of addressing information are not\n      required to be fully\
    \ contained within a single organization - they\n      may span multiple organizations\
    \ (e.g., provider with its\n      subscribers).  Thus if a subscriber changes\
    \ its provider, then to\n      avoid injecting additional overhead in the Internet\
    \ routing\n      system, the subscriber may need to renumber.\n      Changing\
    \ providers is just one possible reason for renumbering.\n      The informational\
    \ document [RFC 1900] shows why renumbering is an\n      increasingly frequent\
    \ event.  Both DHCP [RFC 1541] and PPP [RFC\n      1661] promote the use of dynamic\
    \ address allocation.\n      To summarize, since the development and deployment\
    \ of DHCP and\n      PPP, and since it is expected that renumbering is likely\
    \ to become\n      a common event, IP address significance has indeed been changed.\n\
    \      Spatial uniqueness should be the same, so addresses are still\n      effective\
    \ locators. Temporal uniqueness is no longer assured. It\n      may be quite short,\
    \ possibly shorter than a TCP connection time.\n      In such cases an IP address\
    \ is no longer a good identifier. This\n      has some impact on end-to-end security,\
    \ and breaks TCP in its\n      current form.\n   4.3. Multicast and Anycast\n\
    \      Since we deployed multicast [RFC 1112], we must separate the\n      debate\
    \ over meaning of IP addresses into meaning of source and\n      destination addresses.\
    \  A destination multicast address (i.e. a\n      locator for a topologically\
    \ spread group of hosts) can traverse a\n      NAT, and is not necessarily restricted\
    \ to an intranet (or to the\n      public Internet).  Its lifetime can be short\
    \ too.\n      The concept of an anycast address is of an address that\n      semantically\
    \ locates any of a group of systems performing\n      equivalent functions. There\
    \ is no way such an address can be\n      anything but a locator; it can never\
    \ serve as an identifier as\n      defined in this document, since it does not\
    \ uniquely identify\n      host.  In this case, the effective temporal uniqueness,\
    \ or useful\n      lifetime, of an IP address can be less than the time taken\
    \ to\n      establish a TCP connection.\n      Here we have used TCP simply to\
    \ illustrate the idea of an\n      association - many UDP based applications (or\
    \ other systems\n      layered on IP) allocate state after receiving or sending\
    \ a first\n      packet, based on the source and/or destination. All are affected\n\
    \      by absence of temporal uniqueness whereas only the routing\n      infrastructure\
    \ is affected by spatial uniqueness changes.\n   4.4. Summary\n      Due to dynamic\
    \ address allocation and increasingly frequent\n      network renumbering, temporal\
    \ uniqueness of IPv4 addresses is no\n      longer globally guaranteed, which\
    \ puts their use as identifiers\n      into severe question.  Due to the proliferation\
    \ of Intranets,\n      spatial uniqueness is also no longer guaranteed across\
    \ routing\n      realms; interconnecting routing realms could be accomplished\
    \ via\n      either ALGs or NATs. In principle such interconnection will have\n\
    \      less functionality than if those Intranets were directly\n      connected.\
    \ In practice the difference in functionality may or may\n      not matter, depending\
    \ on individual circumstances.\n"
- title: 5. IPv6 Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. IPv6 Considerations\n   As far as temporal uniqueness (identifier-like behaviour)\
    \ is\n   concerned, the IPv6 model [RFC 1884] is very similar to the current\n\
    \   state of the IPv4 model, only more so.  IPv6 will provide mechanisms\n   to\
    \ autoconfigure IPv6 addresses on IPv6 hosts. Prefix changes,\n   requiring the\
    \ global IPv6 addresses of all hosts under a given prefix\n   to change, are to\
    \ be expected. Thus, IPv6 will amplify the existing\n   problem of finding stable\
    \ identifiers to be used for end-to-end\n   security and for session bindings\
    \ such as TCP state.\n   The IAB feels that this is unfortunate, and that the\
    \ transition to\n   IPv6 would be an ideal occasion to provide upper layer end-to-end\n\
    \   protocols with temporally unique identifiers. The exact nature of\n   these\
    \ identifiers requires further study.\n   As far as spatial uniqueness (locator-like\
    \ behaviour) is concerned,\n   the IPv6 address space is so big that a shortage\
    \ of addresses,\n   requiring an RFC 1918-like approach and address translation,\
    \ is\n   hardly conceivable.  Although there is no shortage of IPv6 addresses,\n\
    \   there is also a well-defined mechanism for obtaining link-local and\n   site-local\
    \ addresses in IPv6 [RFC 1884, section 2.4.8].  These\n   properties of IPv6 do\
    \ not prevent separate routing realms for IPv6,\n   if so desired (resulting in\
    \ multiple security domains as well).\n   While at the present moment we cannot\
    \ identify a case in which\n   multiple IPv6 routing realms would be required,\
    \ it is also hard to\n   give a definitive answer to whether there will be only\
    \ one, or more\n   than one IPv6 routing realms.  If one hypothesises that there\
    \ will be\n   more than one IPv6 routing realm, then such realms could be\n  \
    \ interconnected together via ALGs and NATs. Considerations for such\n   ALGs\
    \ and NATs appear to be identical to those for IPv4.\n"
- title: 'ANNEX: Current Practices for IPv4 Address Allocation & Routing'
  contents:
  - "ANNEX: Current Practices for IPv4 Address Allocation & Routing\n   Initially\
    \ IP address structure and IP routing were designed around\n   the notion of network\
    \ number classes (Class A/B/C networks) [RFC\n   790].  In the earlier 90s growth\
    \ of the Internet demanded significant\n   improvements in both the scalability\
    \ of the Internet routing system,\n   as well as in the IP address space utilization.\
    \  Classful structure\n   of IP address space and associated with it classful\
    \ routing turned\n   out to be inadequate to meet the demands, so during 1992\
    \ - 1993\n   period the Internet adopted Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)\n\
    \   [RFC 1380], [RFC 1518], [RFC 1519].  CIDR  encompasses a new address\n   allocation\
    \ architecture, new routing protocols,  and a new structure\n   of IP addresses.\n\
    \   CIDR improves scalability of the Internet routing system by extending\n  \
    \ the notion of hierarchical routing beyond the level of individual\n   subnets\
    \ and networks, to allow routing information aggregation not\n   only at the level\
    \ of individual subnets and networks, but at the\n   level of individual sites,\
    \ as well as at the level of Internet\n   Service Providers.  Thus an organization\
    \ (site) could act as an\n   aggregator for all the destinations within the organization.\n\
    \   Likewise, a provider could act as an aggregator for all the\n   destinations\
    \ within its subscribers (organizations directly connected\n   to the provider).\n\
    \   Extending the notion of hierarchical routing to the level of\n   individual\
    \ sites and providers, and allowing sites and providers to\n   act as aggregators\
    \ of routing information, required changes both to\n   the address allocation\
    \ procedures, and to the routing protocols.\n   While in pre-CIDR days address\
    \ allocation to sites was done without\n   taking into consideration the need\
    \ to aggregate the addressing\n   information above the level of an individual\
    \ network numbers, CIDR-\n   based  allocation recommends that address allocation\
    \ be done in such\n   a way as to enable sites and providers to act as aggregators\
    \ of\n   addressing information - such allocation is called \"aggregator\n   based\"\
    . To benefit from the \"aggregator based\" address allocation,\n   CIDR introduces\
    \ an inter-domain routing protocol (BGP-4) [RFC 1771,\n   RFC 1772] that provides\
    \ capabilities for routing information\n   aggregation at the level of individual\
    \ sites and providers.\n   CIDR improves address space utilization by eliminating\
    \ the notion of\n   network classes,  and replacing it with the notion of contiguous\n\
    \   variable size (power of 2) address blocks. This allows a better match\n  \
    \ between the amount of address space requested and the amount of\n   address\
    \ space allocated [RFC 1466]. It also facilitates \"aggregator\n   based\" address\
    \ allocation. Eliminating the notion of network classes\n   requires new capabilities\
    \ in the routing protocols (both intra and\n   inter-domain), and IP forwarding.\
    \ Specifically, the CIDR-capable\n   protocols are required to handle reachability\
    \ (addressing)\n   information expressed in terms of variable length address prefixes,\n\
    \   and forwarding  is required to implement the \"longest match\"\n   algorithm.\
    \  CIDR implications on routing protocols are described in\n   [RFC 1817].\n \
    \  The scaling capabilities of CIDR are based on the assumption that\n   address\
    \ allocation reflects network topology as much as possible,\n   especially at\
    \ the level of sites, and their interconnection with\n   providers, to enable\
    \ sites and providers to act as aggregators. If a\n   site changes its provider,\
    \ then to avoid injecting additional\n   overhead in the Internet routing system,\
    \ the site may need to\n   renumber. While CIDR does not require every site that\
    \ changes its\n   providers to renumber, it is important to stress that if none\
    \ of the\n   sites that change their providers will renumber, the Internet routing\n\
    \   system might collapse due to the excessive amount of routing\n   information\
    \ it would need to handle.\n   Maintaining \"aggregator based\" address allocation\
    \ (to promote\n   scalable routing), and the need to support the ability of sites\
    \ to\n   change their providers (to promote competition) demands practical\n \
    \  solutions for renumbering sites.  The need to contain the  overhead\n   in\
    \ a rapidly growing Internet routing system is likely to make\n   renumbering\
    \  more and more common [RFC 1900].\n   The need to scale the Internet routing\
    \ system, and the use of CIDR as\n   the primary mechanism for scaling, results\
    \ in the evolution of\n   address allocation and management policies for the Internet.\
    \ This\n   evolution results in adding the \"address lending\" policy as an\n\
    \   alternative to the \"address ownership\" policy [RFC 2008].\n   IP addressing\
    \ and routing have been in constant evolution since IP\n   was first specified\
    \ [RFC 791]. Some of the addressing and routing\n   principles have been deprecated,\
    \ some of the principles have been\n   preserved, while new principles have been\
    \ introduced. Current\n   Internet routing and addresses (based on CIDR) is an\
    \ evolutionary\n   step that extends the use of hierarchy to maintain a routable\
    \ global\n   Internet.\n"
