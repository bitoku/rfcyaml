  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document examines motivations for Layer 1 Virtual Private\n\
    \   Networks (L1VPNs), provides high-level (service-level) requirements,\n   and\
    \ outlines some of the architectural models that might be used to\n   build L1VPNs.\n\
    \   The objective of the document is mainly to present the requirements\n   and\
    \ architecture based on the work undertaken within Question 11 of\n   Study Group\
    \ 13 of the ITU-T.\n   L1VPNs provide services over layer 1 networks.  This document\n\
    \   provides a framework for L1VPNs and the realization of the framework\n   by\
    \ those networks being controlled by Generalized Multi-Protocol\n   Label Switching\
    \ (GMPLS) protocols.\n   Use of GMPLS protocols for providing L1VPN services has\
    \ several\n   advantages, such as:\n   - Flexible network operation.\n   - Use\
    \ of standardized protocols.\n   - Use of common control and measurement plane\
    \ protocols applicable to\n     various layer 1 networks, including Time Division\
    \ Multiplexing\n     (TDM) networks and optical networks.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n\
    \   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology in\n   [RFC3031],\
    \ [RFC3209], [RFC3471], [RFC3473], [RFC4202], [RFC3945],\n   [RFC4208], and [RFC4026].\n\
    \   In this context, a Layer 1 Network is any transport network that has\n   connectivity\
    \ and/or switching using spatial switching (e.g., incoming\n   port or fiber to\
    \ outgoing port or fiber), lambda-switching, or time-\n   division-multiplex-switching.\n\
    \   A Layer 1 VPN (L1VPN) is a service offered by a core layer 1 network\n   to\
    \ provide layer 1 connectivity between two or more customer sites,\n   and where\
    \ the customer has some control over the establishment and\n   type of the connectivity.\
    \  An alternative definition is simply to say\n   that an L1VPN is a VPN whose\
    \ data plane operates at layer 1.  Further\n   details of the essence of an L1VPN\
    \ are provided in Section 3.\n   In addition, the following new terms are used\
    \ within this document:\n   - Virtual link: A provider network Traffic Engineering\
    \ (TE) link\n     advertised to customers in routing information for purposes\
    \ that\n     include path computation.  A direct data link may or may not exist\n\
    \     between the two end points of a virtual link.\n   - Virtual node: A provider\
    \ network logical node advertised to\n     customers in routing information. \
    \ A virtual node may represent a\n     single physical node, or multiple physical\
    \ nodes and the links\n     between them.\n   - VPN end point: A Customer Edge\
    \ (CE) device's data plane interface,\n     which is connected to a Provider Edge\
    \ (PE) device, and which is\n     part of the VPN membership.  Note that a data\
    \ plane interface is\n     associated with a TE link end point.  For example,\
    \ if a CE router's\n     interface is a channelized interface (defined in SONET/SDH),\
    \ a\n     channel in the channelized interface can be a data plane interface.\n\
    \   - VPN connection (or connection in the L1VPN context): A connection\n    \
    \ between a pair of VPN end points.  Note that in some scenarios a\n     connection\
    \ may be established between a pair of C (Customer)\n     devices using this CE-CE\
    \ VPN connection as a segment or forwarding\n     adjacency defined in [RFC4206].\n\
    \   Note that the following terms are aligned with Provider Provisioned\n   VPN\
    \ (PPVPN) terminology [RFC4026], and in this document, have a\n   meaning in the\
    \ context of L1VPNs, unless otherwise specified.\n   - CE device: A CE device\
    \ is a customer device that receives L1VPN\n     service from the provider.  A\
    \ CE device is connected to at least\n     one PE device.  A CE device can be\
    \ a variety of devices, for\n     example, Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) switch,\
    \ router, and layer\n     2 switch.  A CE device does not have to have the capability\
    \ to\n     switch at layer 1, but it is capable of receiving a layer 1 signal\n\
    \     and either switching it or terminating it with adaptation.  A CE\n     device\
    \ may be attached to one or more C devices on the customer\n     site, and it\
    \ may be a host using a layer 1 connection directly.\n   - PE device: A PE device\
    \ is a provider device that provides L1VPN\n     service to the customer.  A PE\
    \ device is connected to at least one\n     CE device.  A layer 1 PE device is\
    \ a TDM switch, an Optical Cross-\n     Connect (OXC) (see [RFC3945]), or a Photonic\
    \ Cross-Connect (PXC)\n     (see [RFC3945]).  Alternatively, a PE device may be\
    \ an Ethernet\n     Private Line (EPL) type of device that maps Ethernet frames\
    \ onto\n     layer 1 connections (by means of Ethernet over TDM etc.).\n   - P\
    \ (Provider) device: A P device is a provider device that is\n     connected only\
    \ to other provider devices (P or PE devices).  A\n     layer 1 P is a TDM switch,\
    \ OXC, or PXC.\n   - Customer: A customer has authority over a set of CE devices\
    \ within\n     the same VPN (e.g., the owner of CE devices).  Note that a customer\n\
    \     may outsource the management of CE devices to other organizations,\n   \
    \  including to the provider itself.\n   - Provider: A provider has authority\
    \ over the management of the\n     provider network.\n   - Membership information:\
    \ A list of CE-PE TE link addresses belonging\n     to the same VPN.  Membership\
    \ information contains the association\n     of a CE, a PE, and a VPN.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Network Topology
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Network Topology\n   The layer 1 network, made of OXCs, TDM switches, or\
    \ PXCs may be seen\n   as consisting of PE devices that give access from outside\
    \ of the\n   network, and P devices that operate only within the core of the\n\
    \   network.  Similarly, outside the layer 1 network is the customer\n   network\
    \ consisting of C devices with access to the layer 1 network\n   made through\
    \ CE devices.\n   A CE and PE are connected by one or more links.  A CE may also\
    \ be\n   connected to more than one PE, and a PE may have more than one CE\n \
    \  connected to it.\n   A layer 1 connection is provided between a pair of CEs.\
    \  Such a\n   connection follows the hierarchy defined in [RFC4206].  That is,\
    \ a\n   CE-CE connection may be nested in a lower layer connection (e.g., VC3\n\
    \   connection over STM1 connection).  Likewise, the switching\n   capabilities\
    \ of the interfaces of the CEs, PEs, and Ps on which a\n   connection is routed,\
    \ follow the hierarchy defined in [RFC4206].\n"
- title: 3.2.  Introducing Layer 1 VPNs
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Introducing Layer 1 VPNs\n   The concept of a PPVPN has been established\
    \ through many previous\n   documents such as [RFC4664] and [RFC4110].  Terminology\
    \ for PPVPNs is\n   set out in [RFC4026] with special reference to layer 2 and\
    \ layer 3\n   VPNs.\n   The realization of L1VPNs can be based on extensions of\
    \ the concepts\n   of the PPVPN to the layer 1 network.  It must be understood\
    \ that\n   meeting the requirements set out in this document may necessitate\n\
    \   extensions to the existing mechanisms both for the control plane\n   within\
    \ the layer 1 network and for service provisioning at the edge\n   of the network\
    \ (CE and PE devices).  It is at the interface between\n   CE and PE devices that\
    \ the L1VPN service is provided.\n   Note that the fundamental difference between\
    \ L1VPNs and L2/L3 VPNs is\n   that in L1VPNs, data plane connectivity does not\
    \ guarantee control\n   plane connectivity (and vice versa).  But CE-PE control\
    \ plane\n   connectivity is required for L1VPN services provisioned through the\n\
    \   control plane, and CE-CE data plane connectivity is maintained by\n   signaling\
    \ mechanisms based on this control plane connectivity.\n   Furthermore, the provision\
    \ of CE-CE control plane connectivity over\n   the provider network is also required\
    \ for certain levels of L1VPN\n   service, and this can be achieved by the exchange\
    \ of control packets\n   between CEs over the control plane of the provider network.\
    \  This\n   aspect is discussed further in Section 10.2.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Current Technologies for Dynamic Layer 1 Provisioning
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Current Technologies for Dynamic Layer 1 Provisioning\n   Pre-existing\
    \ efforts at standardization have focused on the provision\n   of dynamic connections\
    \ within the layer 1 network (signaling and\n   routing) and the definition of\
    \ interfaces for requesting services\n   between the user and the layer 1 network\
    \ over the User-Network\n   Interface (UNI), and between networks across the External\
    \ Network-\n   Network Interface (E-NNI) (see [RFC3945], [RFC4208], [RFC4139],\
    \ and\n   [RFC4258]).\n   Current UNIs include features to facilitate requests\
    \ for end-to-end\n   (that is, CE to CE) services that include the specification\
    \ of\n   constraints such as explicit paths, bandwidth requirements,\n   protection\
    \ needs, and (of course) destinations.\n   Current E-NNIs include features to\
    \ exchange routing information, as\n   well as to facilitate requests for end-to-end\
    \ services.\n   The UNIs and E-NNIs may be applied in the context of L1VPNs. \
    \ For\n   example, the UNI may be applied between the CE and the PE, and the\n\
    \   E-NNI may be applied between PEs (inter-AS/SP L1VPNs), or between the\n  \
    \ CE and the PE.\n   However, the existing UNI and E-NNI specifications do not\
    \ provide\n   sufficient parameters to support VPNs without some additions.  For\n\
    \   example, there is no way to distinguish between control messages\n   received\
    \ over a shared control link (i.e., a control link shared by\n   multiple VPNs)\
    \ at a UNI/E-NNI, and these messages must be\n   disambiguated to determine the\
    \ L1VPN to which they apply.  A control\n   link is an IP link used for establishing\
    \ a control channel between\n   nodes.\n   Another example is that there is no\
    \ clearly defined way of\n   distributing membership information to be used in\
    \ combination with\n   UNI/E-NNI.  This function is necessary in order to discover\
    \ the\n   existence and location of the CEs to be connected by L1 connections.\n\
    \   Distribution of membership information is typically done by the\n   provider,\
    \ and may be realized by mechanisms such as static\n   provisioning, or by piggybacking\
    \ on routing protocols (e.g., see\n   Section 4.2.1 of [RFC4110]).  Note that\
    \ the method chosen for\n   distribution of membership information depends on\
    \ the solution used\n   for supporting L1VPNs, which is outside of the scope of\
    \ this\n   document.\n   Furthermore, customer addressing realms may overlap with\
    \ each other,\n   and may also overlap with the service provider addressing realm.\n\
    \   This requires address mapping mechanisms, but such mechanisms are not\n  \
    \ well defined in existing UNI/E-NNI specifications.\n   Lastly, there is no clearly\
    \ defined way to restrict connectivity\n   among CEs (or over a UNI/E-NNI).  In\
    \ addition, E-NNIs allow routing\n   information exchange, but there is no clearly\
    \ defined way to allow\n   limited routing information exchange (i.e., a specific\
    \ set of routing\n   information is distributed to a specific set of CEs).\n \
    \  In order for L1VPNs to be supported in a fully functional manner,\n   these\
    \ additional capabilities and other requirements set out later in\n   this document\
    \ must be addressed.\n   Note that inter-AS/SP L1VPNs require additional analysis\
    \ beyond the\n   focus of this document.\n"

- title: 4.1.  Basic Layer 1 Services
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Basic Layer 1 Services\n   Basic layer 1 services may be characterized\
    \ in terms that include:\n   - Connectivity: Between a pair of CEs.\n   - Capacity:\
    \ For example, the bit rate for a TDM service or the\n     capacity of a lambda.\n\
    \   - Transparency: For example, for an SDH network, overhead\n     transparency.\n\
    \   - Availability: The percentage of time that the offered service meets\n  \
    \   the criteria that the provider defines, possibly agreed with each\n     customer.\
    \  To achieve the required level of availability for the\n     customer connections\
    \ the service provider's network may use\n     restoration or protected resources\
    \ [RFC4427].\n   - Performance: The quality of the service delivered to customers,\n\
    \     e.g., the number of error-seconds per month.\n   The layer 1 services may\
    \ be categorized based on the combination of\n   connectivity features (data plane)\
    \ and service control capability\n   features (control plane) available to the\
    \ customer.  A CE is\n   associated with the service interface between a customer\
    \ site and the\n   provider network, and the categorization can be seen in the\
    \ context\n   of this service interface as follows.\n   1.  A single connection\
    \ between a pair of CEs.\n     - Static Service:\n       The classic private line\
    \ service achieved through a permanent\n       connection.\n     - Dynamic Service:\n\
    \       Either a switched connection service, or a customer-controlled\n     \
    \  soft permanent connection service (i.e., the customer is in\n       control\
    \ of when the signaled part is established).\n   2.  Multiple connections among\
    \ a set of CEs.\n     - Static Service:\n       A private network service consisting\
    \ of a mesh of permanent\n       connections.\n     - Dynamic Service:\n     \
    \  A dynamic private network service consisting of any combination\n       of\
    \ switched connection services and customer-controlled soft\n       permanent\
    \ connection services.\n   For service types 1 and 2, connections are point-to-point,\
    \ and can be\n   permanent, soft-permanent, or switched.  For a static service,\
    \ the\n   management plane of the provider network is responsible for the\n  \
    \ management of both the network infrastructure and the end-user\n   connections.\
    \  For dynamic services, the management plane of the\n   provider network is only\
    \ responsible for the configuration of the\n   infrastructure; end-user connections\
    \ are established dynamically via\n   the control plane of the provider network\
    \ upon customer request.\n   This document does not preclude other advanced services\
    \ and topology\n   support, such as point-to-multipoint (P2MP) services, as part\
    \ of the\n   layer 1 services, but these are for further study.\n"

  - "4.2.1.  Customer Merits\n   From the customer's perspective, there are two main\
    \ benefits to a\n   L1VPN.  These benefits apply over and above the advantages\
    \ of access\n   to a dynamically provisioned network.\n   - The customer can outsource\
    \ the direct management of a layer 1\n     network by placing the VPN management\
    \ in the control of a third\n     party.  This frees the customer from the need\
    \ to configure and\n     manage the connectivity information for the CEs that\
    \ participate in\n     the VPN.\n   - The customer can make small-scale use of\
    \ a layer 1 network.  So,\n     for example, by sharing the layer 1 network infrastructure\
    \ with\n     many other users, the customer sites can be connected together\n\
    \     across the layer 1 network without bearing the full cost of\n     deploying\
    \ and managing the layer 1 network.\n   To some extent, the customer may also\
    \ gain from the provider's\n   benefits (see below).  That is, if the provider\
    \ is able to extract\n   more value from the layer 1 network, the customer will\
    \ benefit from\n   lower priced services that are better tailored to the customer's\n\
    \   needs.\n"

    \ requirements from the customers.\n   Additionally, a more flexible VPN structure\
    \ applied to the layer 1\n   network allows the provider to make more comprehensive\
    \ use of the\n   spare (that is, previously unused) resources within the network.\n\
    \   This could be achieved by applying a network model where the provider\n  \

    \   receiving the L1VPN service (i.e., each service department) can offer\n  \
    \ its own services, whose payloads can be any layer (e.g., ATM, IP,\n   TDM).\
    \  The layer 1 transport network and each service network belong\n   to the same\
    \ organization, but may be managed separately.  From the\n   L1VPN service provider's\
    \ point of view, these services are not\n   visible and are not part of the L1VPN\
    \ service.  That is, the type of\n   service being carried within the layer 1\
    \ payload is not known by the\n   service provider.\n   The benefit is that the\
    \ same layer 1 transport network resources are\n   shared by multiple services.\
    \  A large capacity backbone network (data\n   plane) can be built economically\
    \ by having the resources shared by\n   multiple services usually with flexibility\
    \ to modify topologies,\n   while separating the control functions for each service\
    \ department.\n   Thus, each customer can select a specific set of features that\
    \ are\n   needed to provide their own service.\n   Note that it is also possible\
    \ to control and manage these service\n   networks and the layer 1 transport network\
    \ by using GMPLS in the\n   integrated model [RFC3945] instead of using L1VPNs.\
    \  However, using\n   L1VPNs is beneficial in the following points:\n   - Independent\
    \ address space for each of the service networks.\n   - Network isolation (topology\
    \ information isolation, fault isolation\n     among service networks).\n   -\
    \ Independent layer 1 resource view for each of the service networks.\n   - Independent\
    \ policies that could be applied for each of the service\n     networks.\n   These\
    \ points may apply to the management plane functionalities as\n   well as to the\
    \ control plane functionalities.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.3.2. Carrier's Carrier\n   A carrier's carrier is characterized such that one\
    \ carrier that\n   receives another carrier's L1VPN service provides its own services.\n\
    \   In this scenario, two carriers are in different organizations.  It\n   is,\
    \ therefore, expected that the information provided at the service\n   demarcation\
    \ points is more limited than in the multi-service backbone\n   case.  Similarly,\
    \ less control of the L1VPN service is given at the\n   service demarcation points.\
    \  For example, customers of an L1VPN\n   service receive:\n   - A more limited\
    \ view of the L1VPN service provider network.\n   - More limited control over\
    \ the L1VPN service provider network.\n   One of the merits is that each carrier\
    \ can concentrate on a specific\n   service.  For example, the customer of the\
    \ L1VPN service may focus on\n   L3 services, e.g., providing secure access to\
    \ the Internet, leaving\n   the L1VPN provider to focus on the layer 1 service,\
    \ e.g., providing a\n   long-haul bandwidth between cities.  The L1VPN customer\
    \ can construct\n   its own network using layer 1 resources supplied by the L1VPN\n\
    \   provider, usually with flexibility to modify topologies, while\n   separating\
    \ the control functions for each customer carrier.\n"

    \ in Section\n   4.3.2, it is possible for the second tier provider to receive\n\
    \   services from more than one core service provider.  In this scenario,\n  \
    \ there are some benefits for the second tier service provider such as\n   route\
    \ redundancy and dynamic carrier selection based on the price.\n   The second\
    \ tier service provider can support a function that enables\n   a layer 1 resource\
    \ trading service.  Using resource information\n   published by its core service\
    \ providers, a second tier service\n   provider can decide how to best use the\
    \ core providers.  For example,\n   if one core service provider is no longer\
    \ able to satisfy requests\n   for service, an alternate service provider can\
    \ be used.  Or the\n   second tier service provider could choose to respond to\
    \ price changes\n   of service over time.\n   Another example of second tier service\

  contents:

    \ services may wish to\n   set up layer 1 connections not on-demand, but at a\
    \ planned time in\n   the future.  Or, even though customers of L1VPN services\
    \ may wish to\n   use layer 1 connections on-demand, they can tolerate some delay,\
    \ for\n   example, due to lack of resources at that moment.\n   In those scenarios,\
    \ the provider can reserve bandwidth at a specified\n   time in the future, and\
    \ can establish the VPN connections according\n   to a schedule.  This makes it\
    \ possible to use bandwidth more\n   efficiently over time (i.e., support more\
    \ demand).  This service, the\n   scheduling service, may be used to support customers\
    \ who use layer 1\n   connections for data backup applications, content delivery\n\
    \   applications, and some other applications.\n   Furthermore, customers may\
    \ be able to specify when to release layer 1\n   connections in advance.  By considering\
    \ this information, the\n   provider may be able to further engineer scheduling,\
    \ which leads to\n   still more efficient bandwidth usage.\n   Note that scheduling\
    \ of L1VPN services requires time-scoped resource\n   management, which is not\
    \ well considered in current GMPLS protocols\n   and requires the support of the\

    \ to a remote CE.  There is no routing protocol running\n   (i.e., no routing\
    \ neighbor/peering relationship) between a CE and a\n   PE.  The CE does not receive\
    \ routing information from remote customer\n   sites, nor routing information\
    \ about the provider network.\n   The CE's interface may be assigned a public\
    \ or private address, that\n   designates VPN end points.\n   In this model, membership\
    \ information needs to be configured on PEs,\n   so that the PE that receives\
    \ a Path message from the ingress CE can\n   identify the remote PE connected\
    \ to the egress CE.  Distribution of\n   membership information between PEs is\
    \ typically done by the provider,\n   and may be realized by mechanisms such as\
    \ static provisioning, or by\n   piggybacking on routing protocols (auto-discovery).\n\
    \   There are various ways that customers perceive the provider network.\n   In\
    \ one example, the whole provider network may be considered as one\n   node --\
    \ the path specified and recorded in signaling messages\n   reflects this.  Note\
    \ that this is distinct from the Virtual Node\n   service model described in Section\
    \ 7.3.2 because such a model\n   requires that the network is represented to the\
    \ VPN sites as a\n   virtual node -- that is, some form of routing advertisement\

  - "7.3.  Signaling and Routing Service Model (Enhanced Mode)\n   In this service\
    \ model, the CE-PE interface provides the signaling\n   capabilities as in the\
    \ Basic Mode, plus permits limited exchange of\n   information between the control\
    \ planes of the provider and the\n   customer to help such functions as discovery\
    \ of customer network\n   routing information (i.e., reachability or TE information\
    \ in remote\n   customer sites), or parameters of the part of the provider's network\n\
    \   dedicated to the customer.\n   By allowing CEs to obtain customer network\
    \ routing information, a\n   so-called N-square routing problem could be solved.\n\
    \   In addition, by using the received traffic engineering-based routing\n   information,\
    \ a customer can use traffic engineering capabilities.\n   For example, a customer\
    \ can set up two disjoint connections between a\n   pair of CEs.  Another example\
    \ is that a customer can request a\n   connection between a pair of devices within\
    \ customer sites, and not\n   necessarily between CEs, with more effective traffic\
    \ engineering.\n   As such, the customer interface is based on GMPLS signaling\
    \ and\n   mechanisms to exchange reachability/TE information.  Typically, a\n\
    \   routing protocol is used between a CE and PE, or more precisely\n   between\
    \ a CE and the VPN routing context instantiated on the PE.\n   Link state routing\
    \ information would be needed to implement the above\n   two example scenarios.\
    \  Some scenarios may be satisfied with\n   reachability routing information only.\n\
    \   Note that this service model does not preclude the use of mechanisms\n   other\
    \ than routing protocols to exchange reachability/TE information.\n   As with\
    \ the Signaling-based service model, there may be communication\n   between customer\
    \ management system(s) and provider management\n   system(s) in order to provide\
    \ detailed monitoring, fault information\n   etc. to customers.\n   Four specific\
    \ types of the Signaling and Routing service model are\n   the Overlay Extension\
    \ service model, the Virtual Node service model,\n   the Virtual Link service\
    \ model and the Per-VPN Peer service model,\n   depending on how customers perceive\
    \ the provider network in routing\n   and signaling (i.e., the level of information\
    \ details that a customer\n   is allowed to receive in routing and signaling).\n"

    \ information).\n   This may include additional information concerning these TE\
    \ links\n   (e.g., switching type).  Mechanisms other than routing could be used\n\

  - "9.1.  Recovery Scope\n   GMPLS provides various recovery techniques for use in\
    \ different\n   recovery scenarios [RFC4427].  The provider network may apply\
    \ these\n   recovery techniques to protect VPN connections as part of the L1VPN\n\
    \   service, for example as follows:\n   o PE-PE recovery\n     The provider network\
    \ constitutes a recovery domain, and the\n     recovery scope is the PE-PE part\
    \ of the CE-CE VPN connection.\n     It should be possible for the provider network\
    \ to hide the provider\n     network recovery operation from the customer.  Namely,\
    \ it should be\n     possible to configure the provider network to not notify\
    \ the\n     customer when a failure occurs and a PE-PE recovery operation\n  \
    \   successfully repairs the failure.  Further, when PE-PE recovery\n     fails\
    \ and the failure should be notified to the customer, it should\n     be possible\
    \ for the provider network to hide its internal topology.\n   o CE-PE recovery\n\
    \     The recovery scope is either or both of the ingress and egress\n     CE-PE\
    \ links of the CE-CE VPN connection.\n   o CE-CE recovery\n     The recovery scope\

    \   These recovery schemes may be applied in combination.\n   Customers may be\
    \ allowed to specify the desired recovery level in a\n   connection setup request.\
    \  Furthermore, the customer may be allowed\n   to specify the desired recovery\
    \ level in a way that is agnostic of\n   the recovery technique (e.g., when the\
    \ recovery operation does not\n   require cooperation between the provider network\
    \ and the customer\n   network).  In such cases, the provider network must translate\
    \ the\n   specified recovery level into specific recovery techniques, based on\n\
    \   operational policies.  This allows enhanced recovery techniques above\n  \
    \ and beyond the GMPLS specifications to be used in the provider\n   network.\n"
- title: 9.2.  Recovery Resource Sharing Schemes
  contents:
  - "9.2.  Recovery Resource Sharing Schemes\n   The provider network may support\
    \ various recovery resource sharing\n   schemes, such as the following:\n   o\
    \ Shared recovery\n     When the provider network supports shared recovery (e.g.,\
    \ shared\n     mesh restoration [RFC4427]), the provider network may provide\n\
    \     sharing recovery resources between VPN connections that serve with\n   \
    \  only the same VPN, a specific set of VPNs, or any VPN.  The default\n     mode\
    \ is sharing recovery resources with any VPN.\n   o Extra traffic\n     GMPLS\
    \ recovery mechanisms support extra traffic.  Extra traffic\n     allows the transfer\
    \ of preemptable traffic on the recovery\n     resources when these resources\
    \ are not being used for the recovery\n     of protected normal traffic [RFC4427].\n\
    \     In the context of L1VPNs, extra traffic is applied for CE-CE VPN\n     connections,\
    \ or PE-PE part of CE-CE VPN connections.  The latter\n     case may be applied\
    \ only when there is hierarchy (i.e., CE-CE VPN\n     connection is nested on\
    \ top of PE-PE connection).  In this section,\n     the latter aspect is analyzed.\n\
    \     When the provider network allows a CE-CE VPN connection to be set\n    \
    \ up as \"extra traffic\", it means that the VPN connection may use a\n     PE-PE\
    \ connection that protects some other CE-CE VPN connection.  In\n     such a case\
    \ the provider network may restrict extra traffic CE-CE\n     VPN connection to\
    \ use resources (i.e., the PE-PE connections) that:\n     - protect VPN connections\
    \ from the same VPN as the extra traffic\n       connection.\n     - are used\
    \ for a specific set of VPNs.\n     - are available for any VPN.\n   The default\

- title: 10.2.  Control Plane Connectivity between CEs
  contents:
  - "10.2.  Control Plane Connectivity between CEs\n   A customer network connected\
    \ by VPN connections may be controlled by\n   MPLS or GMPLS, and the VPN connections\
    \ may be treated as TE links\n   within the customer network.  In such cases,\
    \ there must be control\n   plane (IP-level) connectivity between the CEs, so\
    \ that control\n   messages, such as signaling and routing messages, can be exchanged\n\
    \   between the CEs.  Furthermore, in some recovery techniques, Notify\n   message\
    \ exchange is needed between the ingress and egress of the VPN\n   connection,\
    \ which requires control plane connectivity between the\n   CEs.  There are several\
    \ potential ways to achieve this.\n   o Use of VPN connections as in-band control\
    \ channels\n     If the CEs have the ability to inject control messages into the\
    \ VPN\n     connections and to extract the messages at the far end of the VPN\n\
    \     connections, then control messages can be exchanged in-band.  For\n    \

    \ the VPN connection provides connectivity in the customer network\n     at a\
    \ different switching capability (implying network technology\n     layer) from\
    \ that used by the provider network to support the CE-PE\n     and PE-PE connectivity,\
    \ then the customer network can utilize any\n     overhead available within the\
    \ VPN connection as a control channel\n     to connect the CEs.  For example,\
    \ if a VPN connection provides a\n     TDM TE link in the customer network but\
    \ is supported by a\n     technology such as lambda or fiber, then the CEs may\
    \ utilize the\n     overhead (DCC) as a control channel, if the network supports\n\
    \     transparent transfer of such overhead.  This operation is\n     transparent\
    \ to the L1VPN service provider.\n   o Use of control-channel-specific VPN connections\n\
    \     A customer establishes VPN connections dedicated as control\n     channels.\
    \  This operation is transparent to the L1VPN service\n     provider, but since\
    \ control plane traffic is likely to be\n     relatively low compared with the\
    \ capacity of VPN connections, this\n     may be an expensive solution for the\
    \ customer.\n   o Use of separate network\n     A customer may utilize another\
    \ network and network service, such as\n     private line service, L3VPN service,\
    \ L2VPN service, or Internet\n     access service, to establish CE-CE control\
    \ channel connectivity.\n     This operation is transparent to the L1VPN service\
    \ provider.\n   o Use of CE-PE control channels\n     In the Signaling-based service\
    \ model, and the Signaling and Routing\n     service model, there must be control\
    \ plane (IP-level) connectivity\n     between the CE and PE, as described in Section\
    \ 10.1.\n     By utilizing this, CE-CE control message exchange could be realized\n\
    \     as part of the service provided by the L1VPN service provider.\n     Namely,\
    \ the provider network transfers control messages received\n     over the CE-PE\
    \ control channel to the other side of the provider\n     network and delivers\
    \ them through the PE-CE control channel.  The\n     realization of this within\
    \ the provider network is up to the\n     operator, but where the provider network\
    \ uses a GMPLS control\n     plane, the customer control plane messages could\
    \ be forwarded\n     through the provider control plane, perhaps using IP tunnels.\n\
    \     Care must be taken to protect the provider network and other\n     customers\
    \ from Denial of Service (DoS) attack.  Traffic saturation\n     over the control\
    \ plane network needs to be carefully managed as\n     well.  Note that if private\
    \ addresses are assigned to the CE-PE\n     control channels, the provider network\
    \ must support VPN-scoped\n     routing and forwarding for control messages.\n"

  - "11.  Manageability Considerations\n   Manageability considerations for GMPLS\
    \ are described in existing\n   documents, such as [RFC3945].  Also, manageability\
    \ considerations for\n   L3VPN are described in existing documents, such as [RFC4176].\
    \  These\n   manageability considerations should also be applied in L1VPNs, and\n\
    \   these aspects are described in this section.  In addition, there are\n   some\
    \ specific manageability considerations for L1VPNs, such as\n   configuration\
    \ and accounting.\n   o Fault management\n   The provider network MUST support\
    \ fault management.  It MUST support\n   liveness detection, and monitoring and\
    \ verification of correct\n   operation.\n   When a failure occurs, the provider\
    \ network SHOULD correlate the\n   failure.  Also, it SHOULD be able to detect\
    \ which customer is\n   affected by the failure.\n   If the provider network can\
    \ resolve failures without intervention\n   from the customer network, it MUST\
    \ be possible to configure the\n   provider network to not report failures to\
    \ the customers.  However,\n   it MAY be part of an agreement between a customer\
    \ and provider that\n   failures are reported to the customer, regardless.\n \
    \  o Configuration management\n   The provider network MUST support configuration\
    \ management, such as\n   the following.\n     - Service mode/model configuration.\n\
    \     - Network representation configuration: Configuration of virtual\n     \
    \  node and virtual link.\n     - Resource allocation configuration: Dedicated,\
    \ shared.  See\n       Section 8 for more detail.\n     - Recovery policy configuration:\
    \ For example, recovery resource\n       sharing schemes, such as shared recovery,\
    \ extra traffic.  See\n       Section 9 for more detail.\n     - Membership configuration.\n\
    \     - Network/Element level configuration: For example, TE link\n       configuration.\n\
    \     It SHOULD be possible for the provider network to verify that\n     configuration\
    \ is correctly made.\n   o Accounting management\n     The provider network MUST\
    \ support accounting management.  It MUST\n     be able to record usage of VPN\
    \ connections for each customer.\n   o Performance management\n     The provider\
    \ network MUST support performance management.\n     In particular, it MUST support\
    \ performance monitoring of parameters\n     associated with the Service Level\
    \ Agreement (SLA), such as bit\n     error rate per VPN connection, and SLA verification.\n\
    \     In addition, it MUST support performance monitoring and analysis of\n  \
    \   parameters related to the network and equipment not directly\n     associated\
    \ with the SLA, such as network resource utilization.\n   o Security management\n\
    \     The provider network MUST support security management.  See Section\n  \
    \   12 for details.\n   o Management systems\n     In order to support various\
    \ management functionalities, the\n     provider network relies on management\
    \ systems and related tools.\n     GMPLS protocols and potential extensions of\
    \ GMPLS MUST be able to\n     work with management systems and related tools to\
    \ provide such\n     functionalities.\n     In particular, MIB modules for GMPLS\
    \ protocols and potential\n     extensions MUST be supported.\n   o Management\
    \ of customer networks\n     Customers MAY outsource management of their network\
    \ (especially CEs\n     and CE-CE links) to the provider network.  In such case,\
    \ the\n     provider MUST be able to manage the customer network, as well as\n\
    \     the provider network.\n"
- title: 12.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "12.  Security Considerations\n   Security is clearly one of the essential requirements\
    \ in L1VPNs.  In\n   this section, key security requirements are highlighted.\
    \  Security\n   considerations for L3VPNs and L2VPNs are described in existing\n\
    \   documents, such as [RFC4110], [RFC4111], and [RFC4664].  These\n   security\
    \ considerations should also be applied in L1VPNs, and these\n   aspects are described\
    \ in this section.  In addition, there are some\n   specific security considerations\
    \ for L1VPNs, such as connectivity\n   restriction and shared control links.\n\
    \   This section first describes types of information to be secured.\n   Then,\
    \ security features or aspects are described.  Finally, some\n   considerations\
    \ concerning scenarios where security mechanisms are\n   applied is described.\n"
- title: 12.1.  Types of Information
  contents:
  - "12.1.  Types of Information\n   It MUST be possible to secure the information\
    \ exchanged between the\n   customer and the provider.  This includes data plane\
    \ information,\n   control plane information, and management plane information.\n\
    \   At layer 1, data plane information is normally assumed to be secured\n   once\
    \ connections are established, since those connections are\n   dedicated to each\
    \ VPN.  That is, it is not possible to communicate\n   unless there is a connection.\
    \  Therefore, in L1VPNs, the main concern\n   of data plane security is restricting\
    \ VPN connections to be used only\n   within the same VPN, as described in Section\
    \ 6.2.  Note that a\n   customer may wish to assure data plane information security\
    \ against\n   not only other customers, but also the provider.  In such case,\
    \ the\n   customer may wish to apply their own security mechanisms for data\n\
    \   plane information (CE-CE security), as later described.\n   In addition, information\
    \ contained in the provider network MUST be\n   secured.  This includes VPN service\
    \ contract information, current VPN\n   connection information, VPN membership\
    \ information, and system\n   information.  Note these types of information MAY\
    \ be accessible to\n   authorized entities.\n"
- title: 12.2.  Security Features
  contents:
  - "12.2.  Security Features\n   Security features include the following:\n   o Data\
    \ integrity\n     The information exchanged between the customer and the provider\n\
    \     MUST be delivered unchanged.\n   o Confidentiality\n     The information\
    \ exchanged between the customer and the provider\n     MUST NOT be disclosed\
    \ to a third party.\n   o Authentication\n     The entity requesting the service\
    \ to the provider MUST be\n     identified and have its identity authenticated,\
    \ and the provider\n     providing the service MUST also be identified and have\
    \ its identify\n     authenticated.\n   o Access control\n     Access to the information\
    \ contained in the provider network, which\n     may be information about the\
    \ customer networks or the existence of\n     customers, as well as about the\
    \ provider network, MUST be\n     restricted to the authorized entity.\n   o DoS\
    \ attack detection and protection\n     The provider network MUST have mechanisms\
    \ to detect DoS attack and\n     to protect against it reactively and proactively.\n"
- title: 12.3.  Scenarios
  contents:
  - "12.3.  Scenarios\n   There are two scenarios (or occasions) in which security\
    \ mechanisms\n   are applied.  One is the service contract phase, where security\n\
    \   mechanisms are applied once.  The other is the service access phase,\n   where\
    \ security mechanisms are applied every time the service is\n   requested.\n \
    \  o Service contract scenario (static)\n     This scenario includes the addition\
    \ of new physical devices, such\n     as CE devices, data links and control links.\
    \  It MUST be guaranteed\n     that these physical devices are connected to the\
    \ right entity.  In\n     addition, authority to access specific information MAY\
    \ be given to\n     each customer as a part of service contract.\n   o Service\
    \ access scenario (dynamic)\n     This scenario includes the reception of connection\
    \ requests,\n     routing information exchange requests (e.g., attempts to establish\n\
    \     a neighbor relationship in routing protocols, or command request\n     via\
    \ the management plane interface), and management information\n     retrieval\
    \ requests.  If a communication channel between the\n     customer and the provider\
    \ (control channel, management interface)\n     is physically separate per customer,\
    \ and the entity connected over\n     this communication channel is identified\
    \ in the service contract\n     phase, the provider can ensure who is requesting\
    \ the service.\n     Also, the communication channel could be considered as secure.\n\
    \     However, when communication channel is physically shared among\n     customers,\
    \ security mechanisms MUST be available and SHOULD be\n     enforced.  Examples\
    \ of such security mechanisms include IPsec\n     [RFC4302] and [RFC4303].  Note\
    \ that even in the case of physically\n     separate communication channels, customers\
    \ may wish to apply\n     security mechanisms to assure higher security, and such\
    \ mechanisms\n     MUST be available.\n     When the entity requesting the service\
    \ is identified, the provider\n     MUST ensure that the request is authorized\
    \ for that entity.  This\n     includes assuring that connection request is between\
    \ VPN end points\n     belonging to the same VPN.\n     Also note that customers\
    \ may wish to apply their own security\n     mechanisms for data plane information\
    \ (CE-CE security).  This\n     includes IPsec [RFC4302] and [RFC4303] for IP\
    \ traffic.\n"
