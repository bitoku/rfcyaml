- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   This memo specifies the frame format for transmission of IPv6\
    \ [IPV6]\n   packets and the method of forming IPv6 link-local addresses on\n\
    \   Ethernet networks.  It also specifies the content of the\n   Source/Target\
    \ Link-layer Address option used the the Router\n   Solicitation, Router Advertisement,\
    \ Neighbor Solicitation, and\n   Neighbor Advertisement messages described in\
    \ [DISC], when those\n   messages are transmitted on an Ethernet.\n"
- title: Maximum Transmission Unit
  contents:
  - "Maximum Transmission Unit\n   The default MTU size for IPv6 packets on an Ethernet\
    \ is 1500 octets.\n   This size may be reduced by a Router Advertisement [DISC]\
    \ containing\n   an MTU option which specifies a smaller MTU, or by manual\n \
    \  configuration of each node.  If a Router Advertisement is received\n   with\
    \ an MTU option specifying an MTU larger than 1500, or larger than\n   a manually\
    \ configured value less than 1500, that MTU option must be\n   ignored.\n"
- title: Frame Format
  contents:
  - "Frame Format\n   IPv6 packets are transmitted in standard Ethernet frames.  The\n\
    \   ethernet header contains the Destination and Source ethernet\n   addresses\
    \ and the ethernet type code, which must contain the value\n   86DD hexadecimal.\
    \  The data field contains the IPv6 header followed\n   immediately by the payload,\
    \ and possibly padding octets to meet the\n   minimum frame size for Ethernet.\n\

  - "Stateless Autoconfiguration and Link-Local Addresses\n   The address token [CONF]\
    \ for an Ethernet interface is the interface's\n   built-in 48-bit IEEE 802 address,\

    \ would appear in the header of\n   an ethernet frame.  (The individual/group\
    \ bit is in the first octet\n   and the OUI is in the first three octets.) A different\
    \ MAC address\n   set manually or by software should not be used as the address\
