  - "1.  Introduction\n   All location-based services rely on ready access to location\n\
    \   information.  Location information can be used in either a direct,\n   Location-by-Value\
    \ (LbyV) approach or an indirect, Location-by-\n   Reference (LbyR) approach.\n\
    \   For LbyV, location information is conveyed directly in the form of a\n   Presence\
    \ Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) [RFC4119].\n   Using LbyV\
    \ might be either infeasible or undesirable in some\n   circumstances.  There\
    \ are cases where LbyR is better able to address\n   location requirements for\
    \ a specific architecture or application.\n   This document provides a list of\
    \ requirements for use with the LbyR\n   approach, and leaves the LbyV model explicitly\
    \ out of scope.\n   As justification for an LbyR model, consider the circumstance\
    \ that in\n   some mobile networks it is not efficient for the end host to\n \
    \  periodically query the Location Information Server (LIS) for up-to-\n   date\
    \ location information.  This is especially the case when power\n   availability\
    \ is a constraint or when a location update is not\n   immediately needed.  Furthermore,\
    \ the end host might want to delegate\n   the task of retrieving and publishing\
    \ location information to a third\n   party, such as to a presence server.  Additionally,\
    \ in some\n   deployments, the network operator may not want to make location\n\
    \   information widely available.  These kinds of location scenarios form\n  \
    \ the basis of motivation for the LbyR model.\n   The concept of an LbyR mechanism\
    \ is simple.  An LbyR is made up of a\n   URI scheme, a domain, and a randomized\
    \ component.  This combination\n   of data elements, in the form of a URI, is\
    \ referred to specifically\n   as a \"location URI\".\n   A location URI is thought\
    \ of as a reference to the current location\n   of the Target, yet the location\
    \ value might remain unchanged over\n   specific intervals of time for several\
    \ reasons.  The type of location\n   information returned as part of the dereferencing\
    \ step may, for\n   example, be influenced by the following factors:\n   - Limitations\
    \ in the process used to generate location information\n     mean that cached\
    \ location might be used.\n   - Policy constraints may dictate that the location\
    \ provided remains\n     fixed over time for specified Location Recipients.  Without\n\
    \     additional information, a Location Recipient cannot assume that the\n  \
    \   location information provided by any location URI is static, and\n     will\
    \ never change.\n   The LbyR mechanism works according to an information life\
    \ cycle.\n   Within this life cycle, location URIs are considered temporary\n\
    \   identifiers, each undergoing the following uses: Creation;\n   Distribution;\
    \ Conveyance; Dereference; and Termination.  The use of a\n   location URI according\
    \ to these various states is generally applied\n   in one of the following ways:\n\
    \   1.  Creation of a location URI, within a location server, based on\n     \
    \  some request for its creation.\n   2.  Distribution of a location URI, via\
    \ a Location Configuration\n       Protocol, between a Target and a location server.\n\
    \   3.  Conveyance, applied to LbyR, for example in SIP (Session\n       Initiation\
    \ Protocol), is the transporting of the location URI, in\n       this case, between\
    \ any successive signaling nodes.\n   4.  Dereference of a location URI, a request/response\
    \ between a\n       client having a location URI and a location server holding\
    \ the\n       location information that the location URI references.\n   5.  Termination\
    \ of a location URI, due to either expiration or\n       cancellation within a\
    \ location server, and that is based on a\n       Target cancellation request\
    \ or some other action, such as timer\n       expiration.\n   Note that this document\
    \ makes no functional differentiation between a\n   Location Server (LS), per\
    \ [RFC3693], and a Location Information\n   Server (LIS), as shown in [RFC5687],\
    \ but may refer to either of them\n   as a location server interchangeably.\n\
    \   Location determination, as distinct from location configuration or\n   dereferencing,\
    \ often includes topics related to manual provisioning\n   processes, automated\
    \ location calculations based on a variety of\n   measurement techniques, and/or\
    \ location transformations (e.g., geo-\n   coding), and is beyond the scope of\
    \ this document.\n   Location Conveyance for either LbyR or LbyV, as defined within\
    \ SIP\n   signaling is considered out of scope for this document.  (See\n   [LOC-CONVEY]\
    \ for an explanation of location conveyance for either\n   LbyR or LbyV scenarios.)\n\
    \   Except for location conveyance, the above stages in the LbyR life\n   cycle\
    \ fall into one of two general categories of protocols, either a\n   Location\
    \ Configuration Protocol or a Location Dereference Protocol.\n   The stages of\
    \ LbyR Creation, Distribution, and Termination, are each\n   found within the\
    \ set of Location Configuration Protocols (LCPs).  The\n   Dereference stage belongs\
    \ solely to the set of Location Dereference\n   Protocols.\n   The issues around\
    \ location configuration protocols have been\n   documented in a location configuration\
    \ protocol problem statement and\n   requirements document [RFC5687].  There are\
    \ currently several\n   examples of documented location configuration protocols,\
    \ namely DHCP\n   [DHCP-LOC-URI], LLDP-MED [LLDP-MED], and HELD [HELD].\n   For\
    \ dereferencing a location URI, depending on the type of reference\n   used, such\
    \ as a HTTP/HTTPS or SIP Presence URI, different operations\n   can be performed.\
    \  While an HTTP/HTTPS URI can be resolved to\n   location information, a SIP\
    \ Presence URI provides further benefits\n   from the SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY concept\
    \ that can additionally be combined\n   with location filters [LOC-FILTERS].\n\
    \   The structure of this document includes terminology, Section 2,\n   followed\
    \ by a discussion of the basic elements that surround how a\n   location URI is\
    \ used.  These elements, or actors, are discussed in an\n   overview section,\
    \ Section 3, accompanied by a graph, associated\n   processing steps, and a brief\
    \ discussion around the use, expiration,\n   authorization, and construction of\
    \ location URIs.\n   Requirements are outlined accordingly, separated as location\n\
    \   configuration requirements, Section 4.1, and location dereference\n   requirements,\
    \ Section 4.2.\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [RFC2119],\n   with the important qualification that, unless otherwise\
    \ stated, these\n   terms apply to the design of the Location Configuration Protocol\
    \ and\n   the Location Dereferencing Protocol, not its implementation or\n   application.\n\
    \   This document reuses the terminology of [RFC3693], such as Location\n   Server\
    \ (LS), Location Recipient (LR), Rule Maker (RM), Target, and\n   Location Object\
    \ (LO).  Furthermore, the following terms are defined\n   in this document:\n\
    \   Location-by-Value (LbyV): Using location information in the form of a\n  \
    \    location object (LO), such as a PIDF-LO.\n   Location-by-Reference (LbyR):\
    \ Representing location information\n      indirectly using a location URI.\n\
    \   Location Configuration Protocol: A protocol that is used by a Target\n   \
    \   to acquire either a location object or a location URI from a\n      location\
    \ configuration server, based on information unique to the\n      Target.\n  \
    \ Location Dereference Protocol: A protocol that is used by a client to\n    \
    \  query a location server, based on the location URI input, and that\n      returns\
    \ location information.\n   Location URI: As defined within this document, an\
    \ identifier that\n      serves as a reference to location information.  A location\
    \ URI is\n      provided by a location server, and is later used as input by a\n\
    \      dereference protocol to retrieve location information.\n"

    \          Figure 1: Location Reference Entities and Interactions\n   Figure 1\
    \ shows the assumed communication model for both a Layer 7\n   location configuration\
    \ protocol and a location dereference protocol.\n   (1) The Target (an end device)\
    \ uses a location configuration protocol\n       to acquire a location reference\
    \ from a LIS, which acts as (or is\n       able to access) an LS.\n       In the\
    \ case where the Target is also a Rule Maker, the location\n       configuration\
    \ protocol can be used to convey policy information.\n       In the case where\
    \ possession of a location URI is the only\n       required form of authorization\
    \ (see Section 3.3), a policy is\n       implied whereby any requester is granted\
    \ access to location\n       information.  This does not preclude other means\
    \ of providing\n       authorization policies.\n       A Target could also acquire\
    \ a location URI from the LS directly\n       using alternative means, for example,\
    \ the acquisition of a\n       presence Address of Record (AoR) to be used for\
    \ location\n       information, in which case, it could be regarded as a location\n\
    \       URI.\n   (2) The Target conveys the location URI to the Location Recipient\n\
    \       (interface out of scope).\n   (3) The Location Recipient dereferences\
    \ the location URI to acquire\n       location information from the LS.\n   The\
    \ LS controls access to location information based on the policy\n   provided\
    \ by the Rule Maker.\n   Note A.  There is no requirement for using the same protocol\
    \ in (1)\n            and (3).\n   Note B.  Figure 1 includes the interaction\
    \ between the owner of the\n            Target and the LIS to obtain Rule Maker\
    \ policies.  This\n            interaction needs to happen before the LIS will\
    \ authorize\n            anything other than what is allowed based on default\n\
    \            policies in order to dereference a location request of the\n    \
    \        Target.  This communication path is out of scope for this\n         \
    \   document.\n   Note C.  The Target might take on the role of the Location Recipient,\n\
    \            in which case, it could attempt to dereference the location\n   \
    \         URI itself, in order to obtain its own location information.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Location URI Usage
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Location URI Usage\n   An example scenario of how the above location configuration\
    \ and\n   location dereference steps might work using SIP is where a Target\n\
    \   obtains a location URI in the form of a subscription URI (e.g., a SIP\n  \
    \ URI) via a location configuration protocol.  In this case, the Target\n   is\
    \ the same as the Recipient; therefore, the Target can subscribe to\n   the URI\
    \ in order to be notified of its current location based on\n   subscription parameters.\
    \  In the example, parameters are set up for a\n   specific Target/Recipient along\
    \ with an expressed geospatial\n   boundary, so that the Target/Recipient receives\
    \ an updated location\n   notification once the boundary is crossed (see [LOC-FILTERS]).\n"
- title: 3.2.  Location URI Expiration
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Location URI Expiration\n   Location URIs may have an expiry associated\
    \ with them, primarily for\n   security considerations, and generally in order\
    \ for the LIS to keep\n   track of the location URIs that have been handed out,\
    \ to know whether\n   a location URI is still valid once the LIS receives it in\
    \ a request,\n   and for preventing a recipient of such a URI from being able\
    \ to (in\n   some cases) permanently track a host.  Expiration of a location URI\n\
    \   limits the time that accidental leaking of a location URI introduces.\n  \
    \ Other justifications for expiration of location URIs include the\n   ability\
    \ for a LIS to do garbage collection.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Location URI Authorization
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Location URI Authorization\n   How a location URI will ultimately be used\
    \ within the dereference\n   step is an important consideration at the time the\
    \ location URI is\n   requested via a location configuration protocol.  The process\
    \ of\n   dereferencing location URIs will be influenced by the specific\n   authorization\
    \ model applied by the Location Information Server and\n   the URI scheme that\
    \ indicates the protocol to be used to resolve the\n   reference to a location\
    \ object.\n   Location URIs manifest themselves in a few different forms.  The\n\
    \   different ways that a location URI can be represented are based on\n   local\
    \ policy, and are depicted in the following four scenarios.\n   1.  No location\
    \ information included in the URI: As is typical, a\n       location URI is used\
    \ to get location information.  However, in\n       this case, the URI representation\
    \ itself does not need to reveal\n       any specific information at all.  Location\
    \ information is\n       acquired by the dereferencing operation using a location\
    \ URI.\n   2.  URI does not identify a Target: By default, a location URI MUST\n\
    \       NOT reveal any information about the Target other than location\n    \
    \   information.  This is true for the URI itself (or in the document\n      \
    \ acquired by dereferencing), unless policy explicitly permits\n       otherwise.\n\
    \   3.  Access control authorization model: If this model is used, the\n     \
    \  location URI MUST NOT include any location information in its\n       representation.\
    \  Location URIs operating under this model could\n       be widely published\
    \ to recipients that are not authorized to\n       receive this information.\n\
    \   4.  Possession authorization model (the URI itself is a secret): If\n    \
    \   this model is used, the location URI is confidential information\n       shared\
    \ between the LIS/LS, the Target, and all authorized\n       Location Recipients.\
    \  In this case, possession implies\n       authorization.  Because knowledge\
    \ of the location URI is used to\n       authenticate and authorize access to\
    \ location information, the\n       URI needs to include sufficient randomness\
    \ to make guessing its\n       value difficult.  A possession model URI can include\
    \ location\n       information in its representation.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Location URI Construction
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Location URI Construction\n   Given scenarios 2 and 4, above, and depending\
    \ on local policy, a\n   location URI may be constructed in such a way as to make\
    \ it difficult\n   to guess.  Accordingly, the form of the URI is then constrained\
    \ by\n   the degree of randomness and uniqueness applied to it.  In this case,\n\
    \   it may be important to protect the actual location information from\n   inspection\
    \ by an intermediate node.  Construction of a location URI\n   in such a way as\
    \ to not reveal any Target-specific information (e.g.,\n   user or device information),\
    \ with the goal of making the location URI\n   appear bland, uninteresting, and\
    \ generic, may be helpful to some\n   degree in order to keep location information\
    \ more difficult to\n   detect.  Thus, obfuscating the location URI in this way\
    \ may provide\n   some level of safeguard against the undetected inspection and\n\
    \   unintended use of what would otherwise be evident location\n   information,\
    \ since it forces a dereference operation at the location\n   dereference server,\
    \ an important step for the purpose of providing\n   statistics, audit trails,\
    \ and general logging for many different\n   kinds of location-based services.\n"

  - "4.  High-Level Requirements\n   This document outlines the requirements for a\
    \ Location by Reference\n   mechanism that can be used by a number of underlying\
    \ protocols.\n   Requirements here address two general types of such protocols,\
    \ a\n   general location configuration protocol and a general location\n   dereferencing\
    \ protocol.\n   The requirements are broken into two sections.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Requirements for a Location Configuration Protocol
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Requirements for a Location Configuration Protocol\n   Below, we summarize\
    \ high-level design requirements needed for a\n   location-by-reference mechanism\
    \ as used within the location\n   configuration protocol.\n   C1. Location URI\
    \ support: The location configuration protocol MUST\n       support a location\
    \ reference in URI form.\n       Motivation: A standardized location reference\
    \ mechanism increases\n       interoperability.\n   C2. Location URI expiration:\
    \ When a location URI has a limited\n       validity interval, its lifetime MUST\
    \ be indicated.\n       Motivation: A location URI may not intend to represent\
    \ a location\n       forever, and the identifier eventually may need to be recycled,\n\
    \       or may be subject to a specific window of validity, after which\n    \
    \   the location reference fails to yield a location, or the location\n      \
    \ is determined to be kept confidential.\n   C3. Location URI cancellation: The\
    \ location configuration protocol\n       MUST support the ability to request\
    \ a cancellation of a specific\n       location URI.\n       Motivation: If the\
    \ Target determines that a location URI should\n       no longer be used to dereference\
    \ a location, then there should be\n       a way to request that the location\
    \ URI be nullified.\n   C4. Location information masking: The location URI MUST\
    \ ensure, by\n       default, through randomization and uniqueness, that the location\n\
    \       URI does not contain location-information-specific components.\n     \
    \  Motivation: It is important to keep any location information\n       masked\
    \ from a casual observing node.\n   C5. Target identity protection: The location\
    \ URI MUST NOT contain\n       information that identifies the Target (e.g., user\
    \ or device).\n       Examples include phone extensions, badge numbers, and first\
    \ or\n       last names.\n       Motivation: It is important to protect caller\
    \ identity or contact\n       address from being included in the form of the location\
    \ URI\n       itself when it is generated.\n   C6. Reuse indicator: There SHOULD\
    \ be a way to allow a Target to\n       control whether a location URI can be\
    \ resolved once only or\n       multiple times.\n       Motivation: The Target\
    \ requesting a location URI may request a\n       location URI that has a 'one-time-use'\
    \ only characteristic, as\n       opposed to a location URI having multiple reuse\
    \ capability.  This\n       would allow the server to return an error with or\
    \ without\n       location information during the subsequent dereference operation.\n\
    \   C7. Selective disclosure: The location configuration protocol MUST\n     \
    \  provide a mechanism that allows the Rule Maker to control what\n       information\
    \ is being disclosed about the Target.\n       Motivation: The Rule Maker has\
    \ to be in control of how much\n       information is revealed during the dereferencing\
    \ step as part of\n       the privacy features.\n   C8. Location URI not guessable:\
    \ As a default, the location\n       configuration protocol MUST return location\
    \ URIs that are random\n       and unique throughout the indicated lifetime. \
    \ A location URI\n       with 128 bits of randomness is RECOMMENDED.\n       Motivation:\
    \ Location URIs should be constructed in such a way\n       that an adversary\
    \ cannot guess them and dereference them without\n       having previously obtained\
    \ them from the Target.\n   C9. Location URI options: In the case of user-provided\
    \ authorization\n       policies, where anonymous or non-guessable location URIs\
    \ are not\n       warranted, the location configuration protocol MAY support a\n\
    \       variety of optional location URI conventions, as requested by a\n    \
    \   Target to a location configuration server (e.g., embedded\n       location\
    \ information within the location URI).\n       Motivation: Users don't always\
    \ have such strict privacy\n       requirements, but may opt to specify their\
    \ own location URI or\n       components to be included within a location URI.\n"

  - "4.2.  Requirements for a Location Dereference Protocol\n   Below, we summarize\
    \ high-level design requirements needed for a\n   location-by-reference mechanism\
    \ as used within the location\n   dereference protocol.\n   D1. Location URI support:\
    \ The location dereference protocol MUST\n       support a location reference\
    \ in URI form.\n       Motivation: It is required that there be consistency of\
    \ use\n       between location URI formats used in a configuration protocol and\n\
    \       those used by a dereference protocol.\n   D2. Authentication: The location\
    \ dereference protocol MUST include\n       mechanisms to authenticate both the\
    \ client and the server.\n       Motivation: Although the implementations must\
    \ support\n       authentication of both parties, any given transaction has the\n\
    \       option not to authenticate one or both parties.\n   D3. Dereferenced location\
    \ form: The value returned by the dereference\n       protocol MUST contain a\
    \ well-formed PIDF-LO document.\n       Motivation: This is in order to ensure\
    \ that adequate privacy\n       rules can be adhered to, since the PIDF-LO format\
    \ comprises the\n       necessary structures to maintain location privacy.\n \
    \  D4. Location URI repeated use: The location dereference protocol MUST\n   \
    \    support the ability for the same location URI to be resolved more\n     \
    \  than once, based on dereference server configuration.\n       Motivation: Through\
    \ dereference server configuration, for\n       example, it may be useful to not\
    \ only allow more than one\n       dereference request, but, in some cases, to\
    \ also limit the number\n       of dereferencing attempts by a client.\n   D5.\
    \ Location confidentiality: The location dereference protocol MUST\n       support\
    \ confidentiality protection of messages sent between the\n       Location Recipient\
    \ and the location server.\n       Motivation: The location URI indicates what\
    \ type of security\n       protocol has to be provided.  An example is a location\
    \ URI using\n       a HTTPS URI scheme.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The method of constructing the location URI to\
    \ include randomized\n   components helps to prevent adversaries from obtaining\
    \ location\n   information without ever retrieving a location URI.  In the\n \
    \  possession model, a location URI, regardless of its construction, if\n   made\
    \ publicly available, implies no safeguard against anyone being\n   able to dereference\
    \ and get the location.  Care has to be paid when\n   distributing such a location\
    \ URI to the trusted location recipients.\n   When this aspect is of concern,\
    \ the authorization model has to be\n   chosen.  Even in this model, care has\
    \ to be taken on how to construct\n   the authorization policies to ensure that\
    \ only those parties have\n   access to location information that are considered\
    \ trustworthy enough\n   to enforce the basic rule set that is attached to location\n\
    \   information in a PIDF-LO document.\n   Any location URI, by necessity, indicates\
    \ the server (name) that\n   hosts the location information.  Knowledge of the\
    \ server in some\n   specific domain could therefore reveal something about the\
    \ location\n   of the Target.  This kind of threat may be mitigated somewhat by\n\
    \   introducing another layer of indirection: namely the use of a\n   (remote)\
    \ presence server.\n   A covert channel for protocol message exchange is an important\n\
    \   consideration, given an example scenario where user A subscribes to\n   location\
    \ information for user B, then every time A gets a location\n   update, an (external)\
    \ observer of the subscription notification may\n   know that B has moved.  One\
    \ mitigation of this is to have periodic\n   notification, so that user B may\
    \ appear to have moved even when\n   static.\n"
