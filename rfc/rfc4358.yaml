    \ (OMA).  OMA defines and manages resources that utilize this\n   URN name model.\

  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   OMA is a specification development body developing technologies\
    \ for\n   mobile devices.  This activity is supported by a membership composed\n\
    \   of network operators, equipment vendors, content providers, and other\n  \
    \ suppliers to the mobile market.\n   Some of the technologies being developed\
    \ by OMA need XML namespaces\n   that are managed so that they are unique and\
    \ persistent.  To assure\n   that the uniqueness is absolute, the registration\
    \ of a specific NID\n   for use by OMA was deemed appropriate.  Therefore, a full\
    \ and\n   complete registration will follow the namespace specification process\n\
    \   as defined in [RFC3406].\n"
- title: 2. URN Specification for "oma" NID
  contents:
  - "2. URN Specification for \"oma\" NID\n   Namespace ID:\n      The NID \"oma\"\
    \ is requested.\n   Registration Information:\n      registration version number:\
    \ 1\n      registration date:           2005-07-18\n   Declared registrant of\
    \ the namespace:\n      Registering organization\n         Name:    Open Mobile\
    \ Alliance\n         Address: 4275 Executive Square\n                  Suite 240s\n\
    \                  La Jolla, CA 92037\n      Designated contact\n         Role:\
    \    Technical Program Manager\n         Email:   TPM@omaorg.org\n   Declaration\
    \ of syntactic structure:\n      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs\
    \ that use the \"oma\"\n      NID will have the following structure:\n       \
    \  urn:oma:{OMAresource}:{ResourceSpecificString}\n      where the \"OMAresource\"\
    \ is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the\n      URN syntax requirements [RFC2141]\
    \ and defines a specific class of\n      resource type.  Each resource type has\
    \ a specific labeling scheme\n      that is covered by \"ResourceSpecificString\"\
    , which also conforms\n      to the naming requirements of [RFC2141].\n      OMA\
    \ maintains a naming authority, the Open Mobile Naming Authority\n      (OMNA),\
    \ that will manage the assignment of \"OMAresources\" and the\n      specific\
    \ registration values assigned for each resource class.\n   Relevant ancillary\
    \ documentation:\n      The Open Mobile Naming Authority (OMNA) provides information\
    \ on\n      the registered resources and the registrations for each.  More\n \
    \     information about OMNA and the registration activities and\n      procedures\
    \ to be followed are available at:\n         http://www.openmobilealliance.org/tech/omna\n\
    \   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n      The OMNA will manage resources\
    \ using the \"oma\" NID and will be the\n      authority for managing the resources\
    \ and subsequent strings\n      associated.  In the associated procedures, OMNA\
    \ will ensure the\n      uniqueness of the strings themselves or shall permit\
    \ secondary\n      responsibility for management of well-defined sub-trees.\n\
    \      OMA may permit use of experimental type values that will not be\n     \
    \ registered.  As a consequence, multiple users may end up using the\n      same\
    \ value for separate uses.  As experimental usage is only\n      intended for\
    \ testing purposes, this should not be a real issue.\n   Identifier persistence\
    \ considerations:\n      OMNA will provide clear documentation of the registered\
    \ uses of\n      the \"oma\" NID.  This will be structured such that each OMAresource\n\
    \      will have a separate description and registration table.\n      The registration\
    \ tables and information will be published and\n      maintained by OMNA on its\
    \ web site.\n   Process of identifier assignment:\n      OMNA will provide procedures\
    \ for registration of each type of\n      resource that it maintains.  Each such\
    \ resource may have three\n      types of registration activities:\n         1)\
    \ Registered values associated with OMA specs or services\n         2) Registration\
    \ of values or sub-trees to other entities\n         3) Name models for use in\
    \ experimental purposes\n   Process for identifier resolution:\n      The namespace\
    \ is not listed with an RDS; this is not relevant.\n   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n\
    \      No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of\n     \
    \ [RFC2141] apply.\n   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n      No special considerations.\n\
    \   Validation mechanism:\n      None specified.  URN assignment will be handled\
    \ by procedures\n      implemented in support of OMNA activities.\n   Scope:\n\
    \      Global\n"

  - "3. Examples\n   The following examples are representative urns that could be\
    \ assigned\n   by OMNA.  They may not be the actual strings that would be assigned.\n\
    \   urn:oma:ac:oma-presence\n     Defines the urn to be used for the Application\
    \ Characteristic\n     object definition for providing attributes to the Presence\
    \ enabler\n     defined in OMA.\n   urn:oma:drms:org-foobar\n     Defines the\
    \ urn associated with the Digital Rights Management\n     System object definition\
    \ allocated to foobar, which is an external\n     organization that made request\
    \ via OMNA for a drms urn.\n"
- title: 4. Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Namespace Considerations\n   The Open Mobile Alliance is developing a variety\
    \ of application and\n   service enablers.  Some of these enablers require that\
    \ supporting\n   information (e.g., data descriptions, attributes, etc.) be fully\n\
    \   specified.  For proper operation, descriptions of the needed\n   supporting\
    \ information must exist and be available in a unique,\n   reliable, and persistent\
    \ manner.  These dependencies provide the\n   basis of need for namespaces, in\
    \ one form or another.\n   As the Open Mobile Alliance work is ongoing and covers\
    \ many technical\n   areas, the possibility of binding to various other namespace\n\
    \   repositories has been deemed impractical.  Each object or\n   description,\
    \ as defined in OMA, could possibly be related to multiple\n   different other\
    \ namespaces, so further conflicts of association could\n   occur.  Thus the intent\
    \ is to utilize the Open Mobile Naming\n   Authority, operated by OMA, as the\
    \ naming authority for OMA-defined\n   objects and descriptions.\n"
- title: 5.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Community Considerations\n   The objects and descriptions required for enablers\
    \ produced by OMA\n   are generally available for use by other organizations.\
    \  The Open\n   Mobile Naming Authority will provide access and support for name\n\
    \   requests by these organizations.  This support can be enabled in a\n   timely\
    \ and responsive fashion as new objects and descriptions are\n   produced.  These\
    \ will be enabled in a fashion similar to current OMNA\n   support.\n"

    \ and any associated\n   mirrors.\n"
