  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a BGP-based mechanism that allows a BGP speaker\n

    peer would use to constrain/filter its outbound routing updates\n   to the speaker.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Currently, it is not uncommon for a BGP speaker [BGP-4]
    to receive,\n   and then filter out some unwanted routes from its peers based
    on its\n   local routing policy.  Since the generation and transmission of\n   routing
    updates by the sender, as well as the processing of routing\n   updates by the
    receiver consume resources, it may be beneficial if\n   the generation of such
    unwanted routing updates can be avoided in the\n   first place.\n   This document
    defines a BGP-based mechanism that allows a BGP speaker\n   to send to its BGP
    peer a set of Outbound Route Filters (ORFs).  The\n   peer would then apply these
    filters, in addition to its locally\n   configured outbound filters (if any),
    to constrain/filter its\n   outbound routing updates to the speaker.\n"

    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
    2119 [RFC2119].\n"
  title: 2.  Specification of Requirements
- contents:
  - "3.  Outbound Route Filter (ORF)\n   This document uses the terms \"Address Family
    Identifier (AFI)\" and\n   \"Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI)\".  In
    the context of\n   this document, the meaning of these terms is the same as in
    [BGP-MP].\n   Conceptually, an ORF entry is a tuple of the form <AFI/SAFI, ORF-\n
    \  Type, Action, Match, ORF-value>; an ORF consists of one or more ORF\n   entries
    that have a common AFI/SAFI and ORF-Type.  An ORF is\n   identified by <AFI/SAFI,
    ORF-Type>.\n   The \"AFI/SAFI\" component provides a coarse granularity control
    by\n   limiting the ORF to only the routes whose Network Layer Reachability\n
    \  Information (NLRI) matches the \"AFI/SAFI\" component of the ORF.\n   The \"ORF-Type\"
    component determines the content of the ORF-value.\n   The \"Action\" component
    controls handling of the ORF Request by the\n   remote peer.  Action can be one
    of ADD, REMOVE, REMOVE-ALL.  ADD adds\n   an ORF entry to the ORF on the remote
    peer; REMOVE deletes a\n   previously installed ORF entry on the remote peer;
    REMOVE-ALL deletes\n   the previously installed entries in the specified ORF on
    the remote\n   peer.\n   The \"Match\" component is used to support matching granularity
    on a\n   per ORF entry basis.  It can be either PERMIT or DENY.  The semantics\n
    \  of PERMIT is to ask the peer to pass updates for the set of routes\n   that
    match the ORF entry.  The semantics of DENY is to ask the peer\n   not to pass
    updates for the set of routes that match the ORF entry.\n   When an ORF is defined,
    an ORF-specific matching rule MUST be\n   specified so that there is no ambiguity
    regarding which ORF entry is\n   considered as the matching entry in the ORF when
    a route is passed\n   through the ORF.\n"

  - "4.  Carrying ORF Entries in BGP\n   ORF entries are carried in the BGP ROUTE-REFRESH
    message [BGP-RR].\n   A BGP speaker can distinguish an incoming ROUTE-REFRESH
    message that\n   carries one or more ORF entries from an incoming plain ROUTE-REFRESH\n
    \  message by using the Message Length field in the BGP message header.\n   A
    single ROUTE-REFRESH message MAY carry multiple ORF entries in one\n   or more
    ORFs, as long as all these entries share the same AFI/SAFI.\n   From the encoding
    point of view, each ORF entry consists of a common\n   part and type-specific
    part, as shown in Figures 1 and 2.\n   The common part consists of <AFI/SAFI,
    ORF-Type, Action, Match>, and\n   is encoded as follows:\n      The AFI/SAFI component
    of an ORF entry is encoded in the AFI/SAFI\n      field of the ROUTE-REFRESH message.\n
    \     Following the AFI/SAFI component is the one-octet When-to-refresh\n      field.
    \ The value of this field can be either IMMEDIATE (0x01) or\n      DEFER (0x02).
    \ The semantics of IMMEDIATE and DEFER are discussed\n      in the \"Operation\"
    section of this document.\n      Following the When-to-refresh field is a collection
    of one or more\n      ORFs, grouped by ORF-Type.\n      The ORF-Type component
    is encoded as a one-octet field.\n      The \"Length of ORF entries\" component
    is a two-octet field that\n      contains the total length (in octets) of the
    ORF entries that\n      follows for the specified ORF type.\n         +--------------------------------------------------+\n

- contents:
  - "6.  Operation\n   A BGP speaker that is willing to receive ORF entries from its
    peer,\n   or would like to send ORF entries to its peer SHOULD advertise the\n
    \  Outbound Route Filtering Capability to the peer using BGP\n   Capabilities
    advertisement [BGP-CAP].\n   A BGP speaker that implements the Outbound Route
    Filtering Capability\n   MUST support the BGP ROUTE-REFRESH message, as defined
    in [BGP-RR].\n   A BGP speaker that advertises the Outbound Route Filtering Capability\n
    \  to a peer using BGP Capabilities advertisement [BGP-CAP] does not\n   have
    to advertise the BGP Route Refresh Capability to that peer.\n   Consider a BGP
    speaker that advertises the Outbound Route Filtering\n   Capability indicating
    its willingness to receive a particular set of\n   <AFI/SAFI, ORF-Type> from its
    peer, and that receives the Outbound\n   Route Filtering Capability indicating
    the desire of the peer to send\n   a particular set <AFI/SAFI, ORF-Type> to the
    speaker.  If for a given\n   AFI/SAFI the intersection between these two sets
    is non-empty, the\n   speaker SHOULD NOT advertise to the peer any routes with
    that\n   AFI/SAFI prior to receiving from the peer any ROUTE-REFRESH message\n
    \  carrying that AFI/SAFI, where the message could be either without any\n   ORF
    entries, or with one or more ORF entry and the When-to-refresh\n   field set to
    IMMEDIATE.  If, on the other hand, for a given AFI/SAFI\n   the intersection between
    these two sets is empty, the speaker MUST\n   follow normal BGP procedures.\n
    \  A BGP speaker may send a ROUTE-REFRESH message with one or more ORF\n   entries
    to its peer only if the peer advertises to the speaker the\n   Outbound Route
    Filtering Capability indicating its willingness to\n   receive ORF entries from
    the speaker, and the speaker advertises to\n   the peer the Outbound Route Filtering
    Capability indicating its\n   desire to send ORF entries to the peer.  The message
    may contain only\n   ORF entries of <AFI/SAFI, ORF-type> that the peer is willing
    to\n   receive, as advertised to the speaker in the Outbound Route Filtering\n
    \  Capability.\n   When a BGP speaker receives a ROUTE-REFRESH message with one
    or more\n   ORF entries from its peer, then the speaker performs the following\n
    \  actions.  If an <AFI/SAFI, ORF-type> carried by the message does not\n   match
    <AFI/SAFI, ORF-type> that the speaker is willing to receive\n   from the peer
    (as advertised to the peer in the Outbound Route\n   Filtering Capability), the
    specified ORF entries in the message are\n   ignored.  Otherwise, the speaker
    modifies the specified ORF\n   previously received, according to the ORF entries
    carried in the\n   message.  If any of the fields of an ORF entry in the message\n
    \  contains an unrecognized value, the whole specified ORF previously\n   received
    is removed.\n   If the Action component of an ORF entry is REMOVE, but the ORF\n
    \  previously received does not contain the specified entry, the ORF\n   entry
    in the message is ignored.\n   ORF entries with either REMOVE or REMOVE-ALL cannot
    remove locally\n   configured outbound route filters.\n   If the When-to-refresh
    indicates IMMEDIATE, then after processing all\n   the ORF entries carried in
    the message the speaker re-advertises to\n   the peer routes from the Adj-RIB-Out
    associated with the peer that\n   have the same AFI/SAFI as what is carried in
    the message, and taking\n   into account all the ORF entries for that AFI/SAFI
    received from the\n   peer.  The speaker MUST re-advertise all the routes that
    have been\n   affected by the ORF entries carried in the message, but MAY also
    re-\n   advertise the routes that have not been affected by the ORF entries\n
    \  carried in the message.\n   If the When-to-refresh indicates DEFER, then after
    processing all the\n   ORF entries carried in the message the speaker defers re-\n
    \  advertisement to the peer routes from the Adj-RIB-Out associated with\n   the
    peer that have the same AFI/SAFI as what is carried in the\n   message, and taking
    into account all the ORF entries received from\n   the peer until the speaker
    receives a subsequent ROUTE-REFRESH\n   message for the same AFI/SAFI either without
    any ORF entries, or with\n   one or more ORF entries and When-to-refresh set to
    IMMEDIATE.\n   If the speaker receives from the peer a ROUTE-REFRESH message without\n
    \  any ORF entries, then the speaker sends to the peer all routes from\n   the
    Adj-RIB-Out associated with the peer whose AFI/SAFI is the same\n   as what is
    carried in the message and taking into account the ORFs\n   (if any) previously
    received from the peer.\n   The set of ORF entries that the speaker sends to the
    peer expresses\n   the speaker's local preference, that the peer may or may not
    decide\n   to honor.\n   During a single BGP session, the speaker MAY pass multiple
    ORF\n   entries to the peer.\n   After a BGP speaker makes changes to the ORF
    entries previously sent\n   to a peer, the speaker MUST send to the peer the updated
    ORF entries\n   with either (a) When-to-refresh set to IMMEDIATE, or (b) When-to-\n
    \  refresh set to DEFER followed by a plain ROUTE-REFRESH message.  The\n   latter
    MUST be used by the speaker when there are other policy\n   changes (in addition
    to the ORF entries) that require the peer to\n   re-advertise all the routes.\n
    \  The lifetime of an ORF is the duration of the BGP session during\n   which
    the ORF is exchanged.\n   An ORF is removed when the last ORF entry is removed
    (either via\n   REMOVE-ALL, or via a sequence of REMOVE).\n   If a particular
    route maintained by a BGP speaker does not match any\n   of the ORF entries of
    any of the (non-empty) ORFs associated with a\n   particular peer, then this route
    SHOULD NOT be advertised to the\n   peer.\n   If a BGP speaker maintains multiple
    ORFs of different ORF-Types for a\n   particular peer, then the decision by the
    speaker to advertise a\n   route to the peer is determined by passing the route
    through each\n   such ORF, and combining the results (combining of PERMIT and
    DENY\n   results in DENY).\n"
