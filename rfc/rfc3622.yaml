    \   federated network identity.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Liberty Architecture seeks to provide federated network\
    \ identity\n   in such a way that enhances security, privacy and trust; thus\n\
    \   creating a networked world across which individuals and businesses\n   can\
    \ engage in virtually any transaction without compromising the\n   privacy and\
    \ security of vital identity information.\n   One fundamental component of this\
    \ architecture is its use of XML [5],\n   and specifically, XML Schema [7] and\
    \ Namespaces [6].  These\n   components require identifiers that will live far\
    \ beyond the lifetime\n   of the organization that produced them.  As such, a\
    \ URN namespace for\n   those components that adheres to the assumptions and policies\
    \ of the\n   Liberty specification is required.\n   This namespace specification\
    \ is for a formal namespace.\n"

  - "2.  Specification Template\n   Namespace ID:\n      \"liberty\" requested.\n\
    \   Registration Information:\n      Registration Version Number: 1\n      Registration\
    \ Date: 2003-04-01\n   Declared registrant of the namespace:\n      Liberty Alliance\
    \ Project\n      c/o IEEE-ISTO\n      445 Hoes Lane\n      Piscataway, NJ 08855-1331,\
    \ USA\n      info@projectliberty.org\n   Declaration of structure:\n      The\
    \ Namespace Specific Strings (NSS) of all URNs assigned by\n      Liberty will\
    \ conform to the syntax defined in section 2.2 of RFC\n      2141 [1].  In addition,\
    \ all Liberty URN NSSs will consist of a\n      left-to-right series of tokens\
    \ delimited by colons.  The left-to-\n      right sequence of colon-delimited\
    \ tokens corresponds to descending\n      nodes in a tree.  To the right of the\
    \ lowest naming authority node\n      there may be zero, one or more levels of\
    \ hierarchical (although\n      not in the RFC 2396 [2] sense of 'hierarchy')\
    \ naming nodes\n      terminating in a rightmost leaf node.  See the section entitled\n\
    \      \"Identifier assignment\" below for more on the semantics of NSSs.\n  \
    \    This syntax convention is captured in the following normative ABNF\n    \
    \  [4] rules for Liberty NSSs:\n      Liberty-NSS        =   1*(subStChar) 0*(\"\
    :\" 1*(subStChar))\n      subStChar       =   trans / \"%\" HEXDIG HEXDIG\n  \
    \    trans           =   ALPHA / DIGIT / other / reserved\n      other       \
    \    =   \"(\" / \")\" / \"+\" / \",\" / \"-\" / \".\" /\n                   \
    \       \"=\" / \"@\" / \";\" / \"$\" /\n                          \"_\" / \"\
    !\" / \"*\" / \"'\"\n      reserved        =   \"%\" / \"/\" / \"?\" / \"#\"\n\
    \      The exclusion of the colon from the list of \"other\" characters\n    \
    \  means that the colon can only occur as a delimiter between string\n      tokens.\
    \  Note that this ABNF rule set guarantees that any valid\n      Liberty NSS is\
    \ also a valid RFC 2141 NSS.\n      For example:\n         urn:liberty:schemas:authctx:2002:05\n\
    \         urn:liberty:schemas:core:2002:12\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n\

    \ Project\n      January 15, 2003\n   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n\
    \      Identifiers are assigned by the Liberty Project within its various\n  \
    \    standards.  In the process of publishing a specification all newly\n    \
    \  minted names are checked against the record of previously assigned\n      names.\n\
    \   Identifier persistence considerations:\n      The assignment process guarantees\
    \ that names are not reassigned\n      and that the binding between the name and\
    \ its resource is\n      permanent, regardless of any standards or organizational\
    \ changes.\n   Process of identifier assignment:\n      Names are assigned by\
    \ the Liberty standards publication process.\n   Process of identifier resolution:\n\
    \      At this time no resolution mechanism is specified.\n   Rules for Lexical\
    \ Equivalence:\n      Lexical equivalence of two Liberty namespace specific strings\n\
    \      (NSSs) is defined as an exact, case-sensitive string match.  The\n    \
    \  Liberty Alliance will assign names of immediately subordinate\n      naming\
    \ authorities in a case-insensitive fashion, so that there\n      will not be\
    \ two Liberty-subordinate naming authorities whose names\n      differ only in\
    \ case.\n   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n      There are no additional characters\
    \ reserved.\n   Validation mechanism:\n      None other than verifying with the\
    \ correct Liberty specifications.\n   Scope:\n      Global\n"

- title: 4.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Community Considerations\n   While there is no resolution mechanism for this\
    \ namespace, the names\n   themselves are used in public implementations of the\
    \ Liberty\n   specifications.  There are circumstances where objects from the\n\
    \   Liberty system will become exposed to the general Internet.  In these\n  \
    \ cases, the use of the Liberty namespace will provide general\n   interoperability\
    \ benefits to the Internet at large.  Additionally,\n   there may be subcomponents\
    \ of the Liberty specifications that may be\n   adopted by other standards, in\
    \ which case the URNs used to identify\n   those components and specifications\
    \ can be easily used to enhance\n   other, non-Liberty based, systems.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Since there is no defined resolution mechanism\
    \ for Liberty URNs it is\n   difficult to authenticate the fact that a given namespace\
    \ actually\n   adheres to the standard, thus applications should be careful to\
    \ not\n   take some unverified sources assertion that what it is sending\n   adheres\
    \ to what the actual URN is assigned to.\n"
