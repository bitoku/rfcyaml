- title: 2  DIT structure
  contents:
  - "2  DIT structure\n   The majority of this document is concerned with DIT structure\
    \ and\n   naming for organisations, organisational units and personal entries.\n\
    \   This section briefly notes three other key issues.\n"
- title: 2.1  The top level of the DIT
  contents:
  - "2.1  The top level of the DIT\n   The following information will be present at\
    \ the top level of the\n   DIT:\n   Participating Countries\n      The entries\
    \ should contain suitable values of the \"Friendly\n      Country\" attribute.\n\
    \   International Organisations\n      An international organisation is an organisation,\
    \ such as the\n      United Nations, which inherently has a brief and scope covering\n\
    \      many nations.  Such organisations might be considered to be\n      supra-national\
    \ and this, indeed, is the raison-d'etre of such\n      organisations.  Such organisations\
    \ will almost all be governmental\n      or quasi-governmental.  A multi-national\
    \ organisation is an\n      organisation which operates in more than one country,\
    \ but is not\n      supra-national.  This classification includes the large commercial\n\
    \      organisations whose production and sales are spread throughout a\n    \
    \  large number of countries.\n      International organisations, may be registered\
    \ at the top level.\n      This will not be done for multi-national organisations.\
    \  The only\n      international organisation registered so far is:  Internet.\
    \  This\n      is not a formal registration, but is adopted for the Internet\n\
    \      Directory Service.\n   Localities\n      A few localities will be registered\
    \ under the root.  The chief\n      purpose of these locality entries is to provide\
    \ a \"natural\" parent\n      node for organisations which are supra-national,\
    \ and yet which do\n      not have global authority in their particular field.\
    \  Such\n      organisations will usually be governmental or quasi-governmental.\n\
    \      Example localities might include: Europe, Africa, West Indies.\n      Example\
    \ organisations within Europe might include: European Court\n      of Justice,\
    \ European Space Agency, European Commission.\n   DSA Information\n      Some\
    \ information on DSAs may be needed at the top level.  This\n      should be kept\
    \ to a minimum.\n   The only directory information for which there is a recognised\
    \ top\n   level registration authority is countries.  Registration of other\n\
    \   information at the top level may potentially cause problems.  At this\n  \
    \ stage, it is argued that the benefits of additional top level\n   registration\
    \ outweighs these problems.  However, this potential\n   problem should be noted\
    \ by anyone making use of such a registration.\n"
- title: 2.2  The DNS within the DIT
  contents:
  - "2.2  The DNS within the DIT\n   The rules for the DNS parts of the DIT are defined\
    \ in [3].  One\n   modification to this is that the DNS tree will be rooted under\n\
    \   \"O=Internet\", rather than at the root of the DIT.\n"
- title: 2.3  Access control
  contents:
  - "2.3  Access control\n   An entry's object class attribute, and any attribute(s)\
    \ used for\n   naming an entry are of special significance and may be considered\
    \ to\n   be \"structural\".  Any inability to access these attributes will often\n\
    \   militate against successful querying of the Directory.  For example,\n   user\
    \ interfaces typically limit the scope of their searches by\n   searching for\
    \ entries of a particular type, where the type of entry\n   is indicated by its\
    \ object class.  Thus, unless the intention is to\n   bar public access to an\
    \ entry or set of entries, the object class and\n   naming attributes should be\
    \ publicly readable.\n"
- title: 3  Naming Style
  contents:
  - "3  Naming Style\n   The first goal of naming is to provide unique identifiers\
    \ for\n   entries.  Once this is achieve, the next major goal in naming entries\n\
    \   should be to facilitate querying of the Directory.  In particular,\n   support\
    \ for a naming structure which facilitates use of user friendly\n   naming is\
    \ desirable.  Other considerations, such as accurately\n   reflecting the organisational\
    \ structure of an organisation, should be\n   disregarded if this has an adverse\
    \ effect on normal querying.  Early\n   experience in the pilot has shown that\
    \ a consistent approach to\n   structure and naming is an aid to querying using\
    \ a wide range of user\n   interfaces, as interfaces are often optimised for DIT\
    \ structures\n   which appear prevalent.\n   Naming is dependent on a number of\
    \ factors and these are now\n   considered in turn.\n"
- title: 3.1  National Guidelines
  contents:
  - "3.1  National Guidelines\n   Where naming is being done in a country which has\
    \ established\n   guidelines for naming, these guidelines should in general be\n\
    \   followed.  These guidelines might be based on an established\n   registration\
    \ authority, or may make use use of an existing\n   registration mechanism (e.g.,\
    \ company name registration).\n   Where an organisation has a name which is nationally\
    \ registered in an\n   existing registry, this name is likely to be appropriate\
    \ for use in\n   the Directory, even in cases where there are no national guidelines.\n"
- title: 3.2  Structure Rules
  contents:
  - "3.2  Structure Rules\n   A DIT structure is suggested in Annex B of X.521, and\
    \ it is\n   recommended that Directory Pilots should follow a slightly modified\n\
    \   form of these guidelines.  The rules should be extended for handling\n   DNS\
    \ [3].  Some simple restrictions should be applied, as described\n   below.\n\
    \   For most countries pilots, the following simple structure should\n   suffice.\
    \  The country entry will appear immediately beneath the root\n   of the tree.\
    \  Organisations which have national significance should\n   have entries immediately\
    \ beneath their respective country entries.\n   Smaller organisations which are\
    \ only known in a particular locality\n   should be placed underneath locality\
    \ entries representing states or\n   similar geographical divisions.  Large organisations\
    \ will probably\n   need to be sub-divided by organisational units to help in\
    \ the\n   disambiguation of entries for people with common names.  Entries for\n\
    \   people and roles will be stored beneath organisations or\n   organisational\
    \ units.  An example plan evolving for the US is the\n   work of the North American\
    \ Directory Forum [2].\n   As noted above, there will be a few exceptions to this\
    \ basic\n   structure.  International organisations will be stored immediately\n\
    \   under the root of the tree.  Multi-national organisations will be\n   stored\
    \ within the framework outlined, but with some use of aliases\n   and attributes\
    \ such as seeAlso to help bind together the constituent\n   parts of these organisations.\
    \  This is discussed in more detail\n   later.\n"
- title: 3.3  Depth of tree
  contents:
  - "3.3  Depth of tree\n   The broad recommendation is that the DIT should be as\
    \ flat as\n   possible.  A flat tree means that Directory names will be relatively\n\
    \   short, and probably somewhat similar in length and component\n   structure\
    \ to paper mail addresses.  A deep DIT would imply long\n   Directory names, with\
    \ somewhat arbitrary component parts, with a\n   result which it is argued seems\
    \ less natural.  Any artificiality in\n   the choice of names militates against\
    \ successful querying.\n   A presumption behind this style of naming is that most\
    \ querying will\n   be supported by the user specifying convenient strings of\
    \ characters\n   which will be mapped onto powerful search operations.  The\n\
    \   alternative approach of the user browsing their way down the tree and\n  \
    \ selecting names from large numbers of possibilities may be more\n   appropriate\
    \ in some cases, and a deeper tree facilitates this.\n   However, these guidelines\
    \ recommend a shallow tree, and implicitly a\n   search oriented approach.\n \
    \  It may be considered that there are two determinants of DIT depth:\n   first,\
    \ how far down the DIT an organisation is placed; second, the\n   structure of\
    \ the DIT within organisations.\n   The structure of the upper levels of the tree\
    \ will be determined in\n   due course by various registration authorities, and\
    \ the pilot will\n   have to work within the given structure.  However, it is\
    \ important\n   that the various pilots are cognisant of what the structures are\n\
    \   likely to be, and move early to adopt these structures.\n   The other principal\
    \ determinant of DIT depth is whether an\n   organisation splits its entries over\
    \ a number of organisational\n   units, and if so, the number of levels.  The\
    \ recommendation here is\n   that this sub-division of organisations is kept to\
    \ a minimum.  A\n   maximum of two levels of organisational unit should suffice\
    \ even for\n   large organisations.  Organisations with only a few tens or hundreds\n\
    \   of employees should strongly consider not using organisational units\n   at\
    \ all.  It is noted that there may be some problems with choice of\n   unique\
    \ RDNs when using a flat DIT structure.  Multiple value RDNs can\n   alleviate\
    \ this problem.  The standard recommends that an\n   organizationalUnitName attribute\
    \ can also be used as a naming\n   attribute to disambiguate entries.  Further\
    \ disambiguation may be\n   achieved by the use of a personalTitle attribute in\
    \ the RDN.\n"
- title: 3.4  Organisation and Organisational Unit Names
  contents:
  - "3.4  Organisation and Organisational Unit Names\n   The naming of organisations\
    \ in the Directory will ultimately come\n   under the jurisdiction of official\
    \ naming authorities.  In the\n   interim, it is recommended that pilots and organisations\
    \ follow these\n   guidelines.  An organisation's RDN should usually be the full\
    \ name of\n   the organisation, rather than just a set of initials.  This means\n\
    \   that University College London should be preferred over UCL. An\n   example\
    \ of the problems which a short name might cause is given by\n   the proposed\
    \ registration of AA for the Automobile Association.  This\n   seems reasonable\
    \ at first glance, as the Automobile Association is\n   well known by this acronym.\
    \  However, it seems less reasonable in a\n   broader perspective when you consider\
    \ organisations such as\n   Alcoholics Anonymous and American Airlines which use\
    \ the same\n   acronym.  Just as initials should usually be avoided for\n   organisational\
    \ RDNs, so should formal names which, for example, exist\n   only on official\
    \ charters and are not generally well known.  There\n   are two reasons for this\
    \ approach:\n   1.  The names should be meaningful.\n   2.  The names should uniquely\
    \ identify the organisation, and be a\n       name which is unlikely to be challenged\
    \ in an open registration\n       process.  For example, UCL might well be challenged\
    \ by United\n       Carriers Ltd.\n   The same arguments on naming style can be\
    \ applied with even greater\n   force to the choice of RDNs for organisational\
    \ units.  While\n   abbreviated names will be in common parlance within an organisation,\n\
    \   they will almost always be meaningless outside of that organisation.\n   While\
    \ many people in academic computing habitually refer to CS when\n   thinking of\
    \ Computer Science, CS may be given several different\n   interpretations.  It\
    \ could equally be interpreted as Computing\n   Services, Cognitive Science, Clinical\
    \ Science or even Counselling\n   Services.\n   For both organisations and organisational\
    \ units, extra naming\n   information should be stored in the directory as alternative\
    \ values\n   of the naming attribute.  Thus, for University College London, UCL\n\
    \   should be stored as an alternative organizationName attribute value.\n   Similarly\
    \ CS could be stored as an alternative organizationalUnitName\n   value for Computer\
    \ Science and any of the other departments cited\n   earlier.  In general, entries\
    \ will be located by searching, and so it\n   is not essential to have names which\
    \ are either memorable or\n   guessable.  Minimising of typing may be achieved\
    \ by use of carefully\n   selected alternate values.\n"
- title: 3.5  Naming human users
  contents:
  - "3.5  Naming human users\n   A reasonably consistent approach to naming people\
    \ is particularly\n   critical as a large percentage of directory usage will be\
    \ looking up\n   information about people.  User interfaces will be better able\
    \ to\n   assist users if entries have names conforming to a common format, or\n\
    \   small group of formats.  It is suggested that the RDN should follow\n   such\
    \ a format.  Alternative values of the common name attribute\n   should be used\
    \ to store extra naming information.  It seems sensible\n   to try to ensure that\
    \ the RDN commonName value is genuinely the most\n   common name for a person\
    \ as it is likely that user interfaces may\n   choose to place greater weight\
    \ on matches on the RDN than on matches\n   on one of the alternative names. \
    \ It is proposed that pilots should\n   ignore the standard's recommendations\
    \ on storing personal titles, and\n   letters indicating academic and professional\
    \ qualifications within\n   the commonName attribute, as this overloads the commonName\
    \ attribute.\n   A personalTitle attribute has already been specified in the COSINE\n\
    \   and Internet Schema, and another attribute could be specified for\n   information\
    \ about qualifications.\n   Furthermore, the common name attribute should not\
    \ be used to hold\n   other attribute information such as telephone numbers, room\
    \ numbers,\n   or local codes.  Such information should be stored within the\n\
    \   appropriate attributes as defined in the COSINE and Internet X.500\n   Schema.\
    \  If such attributes have to be used to disambiguate entries,\n   multi-valued\
    \ RDNs should be used, such that other attribute(s) be\n   used for naming in\
    \ addition to a common name.\n   The choice of RDN for humans will be influenced\
    \ by cultural\n   considerations.  In many countries the best choice will be of\
    \ the\n   form familiar-first-name surname.  Thus, Steve Hardcastle-Kille is\n\
    \   preferred as the RDN choice for one of this document's co-authors,\n   while\
    \ Stephen E. Hardcastle-Kille is stored as an alternative\n   commonName value.\
    \  Sets of initials should not be concatenated into a\n   single \"word\", but\
    \ be separated by spaces and/or \".\" characters.\n   Pragmatic choices will have\
    \ to be made for other cultures.\n"
- title: 3.6  Application Entities
  contents:
  - "3.6  Application Entities\n   The guidelines of X.521 should be followed, in\
    \ that the application\n   entity should always be named relative to an Organisation\
    \ or\n   Organisational Unit.  The application process will often correspond\n\
    \   to a system or host.  In this case, the application entities should\n   be\
    \ named by Common Names which identify the service (e.g., \"FTAM\n   Service\"\
    ).  In cases where there is no useful distinction between\n   application process\
    \ and application entity, the application process\n   may be omitted (This is\
    \ often done for DSAs in the current pilot).\n"
- title: 4  Multinational Organisations
  contents:
  - "4  Multinational Organisations\n   The standard says that only international\
    \ organisations may be placed\n   under the root of the DIT. This implies that\
    \ multi-national\n   organisations must be represented as a number of separate\
    \ entries\n   underneath country or locality entries.  This structure makes it\
    \ more\n   awkward to use X.500 within a multi-national to provide an internal\n\
    \   organisational directory, as the data is now spread widely throughout\n  \
    \ the DIT, rather than all being grouped within a single sub-tree.\n   Many people\
    \ have expressed the view that this restriction is a severe\n   limitation of\
    \ X.500, and argue that the intentions of the standard\n   should be ignored in\
    \ this respect.  This note argues, though, that\n   the standard should be followed.\n\
    \   No attempt to precisely define multinational organisation is essayed\n   here.\
    \  Instead, the observation is made that the term is applied to a\n   variety\
    \ of organisational structures, where an organisation operates\n   in more than\
    \ one country.  This suggests that a variety of DIT\n   structures may be appropriate\
    \ to accommodate these different\n   organisational structures.  This document\
    \ suggests three approaches,\n   and notes some of the characteristics associated\
    \ with each of these\n   approaches.\n   Before considering the approaches, it\
    \ is worth bearing in mind again\n   that a major aim in the choice of a DIT structure\
    \ is to facilitate\n   querying, and that approaches which militate against this\
    \ should be\n   avoided wherever possible.\n"

    \ of\n      the organisation can be followed by the protocol and thus\n      organisation-wide\

    \  The view from the centre of the organisation may\n      well be that all constituent\
    \ organisations should be seen as part\n      of the main organisation, whereas\
    \ other parts of the organisation\n      may only be interested in the organisation's\
    \ centre and a few of\n      its sibling organisations.  The third model gives\
    \ an equally\n      flexible view of organisational structures.\n   Lookup performance\n\
    \      All methods should perform reasonably well, providing information\n   \
    \   is held, or at least replicated, within a single DSA.\n"

  - "5.1  Schema consistency of aliases\n   According to the letter of the standard,\
    \ an alias may point at any\n   entry.  It is beneficial for aliases to be ``schema\
    \ consistent''.\n   The following two checks should be made:\n   1.  The Relative\
    \ Distinguished Name of the alias should be a valid\n       Relative Distinguished\
    \ Name of the entry.\n   2.  If the entry (aliased object) were placed where the\
    \ alias is,\n       there should be no schema violation.\n"
- title: 5.2  Organisational Units
  contents:
  - "5.2  Organisational Units\n   There is a problem that many organisations can\
    \ be either\n   organisations or organisational units, dependent on the location\
    \ in\n   the DIT (with aliases giving the alternate names).  For example, an\n\
    \   organisation may be an independent national organisation and also an\n   organisational\
    \ unit of a parent organisation.  To achieve this, it is\n   important to allow\
    \ an entry to be of both object class organisation\n   and of object class organisational\
    \ unit.\n"
