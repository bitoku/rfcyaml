    \ a\n   remedy to the problem created by the \"Standards Action\" IANA policy\n\
    \   for protocols for which, by the IETF process, implementation and\n   deployment\
    \ experience is desired or required prior to publication.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In Standards Track RFCs, there is often a need to allocate\
    \ code\n   points for various objects, messages, or other protocol entities so\n\
    \   that implementations can interoperate.  Many of these code point\n   spaces\
    \ have registries handled by the Internet Assigned Number\n   Authority (IANA).\
    \  Several IANA allocation policies are described in\n   RFC 2434 [2434].  Some\
    \ of them, such as First Come First Served or\n   Expert Review, do not require\
    \ a formal IETF action before the IANA\n   performs allocation.  However, in situations\
    \ where code points are a\n   scarce resource and/or the IETF community is willing\
    \ to retain tight\n   control of the protocol, policies such as IESG Approval,\
    \ IETF\n   Consensus, or Standards Action have been used.  The Standards Action\n\
    \   policy represents a problem in situations where implementation and/or\n  \
    \ deployment experience are desired or required for the Standards\n   Action.\n\
    \   To break the deadlock, \"pre-RFC\" implementations have sometimes\n   simply\
    \ chosen some \"seemingly unused\" code points; these may turn out\n   to be different\
    \ from those later assigned by IANA.  To make matters\n   worse, these \"pre-RFC\"\
    \ implementations are often deployed.  This\n   creates several potential interoperability\
    \ problems between early\n   implementations and implementations of the final\
    \ standard, as\n   described below:\n   1. IANA allocates code points different\
    \ from those that early\n      implementations assumed would be allocated.  Early\
    \ implementations\n      won't interoperate with standard ones.\n   2. IANA allocates\
    \ code points used silently for other extensions.\n      Different extensions\
    \ will collide.\n   This gets in the way of the main purpose of standards; namely,\
    \ to\n   facilitate interoperable implementations.\n   It is easy to say that\
    \ pre-RFC implementations should be kept private\n   and should not be deployed;\
    \ however, both the length of the standards\n   process and the immense value\
    \ of early implementations and early\n   deployments suggest finding a better\
    \ solution.  As an example, in the\n   case of documents produced by Working Groups\
    \ in the Routing Area, a\n   pre-RFC implementation is highly desirable and sometimes\
    \ even\n   required, and early deployments provide useful feedback on the\n  \
    \ technical and operational quality of the specification.\n   This memo proposes\
    \ that, under strictly controlled circumstances,\n   IANA make an early allocation\
    \ of code points.  The memo lays out the\n   conditions for early allocation,\
    \ as well as the process to be\n   followed; it also says how these allocations\
    \ are dealt with in the\n   event of a failure in the process (such as the RFC\
    \ not being\n   published).\n   This memo only addresses the early allocation\
    \ of code points from\n   spaces whose allocation policy is \"Standards Action\"\
    \ [2434] AND that\n   have been amended to permit early allocation.  This permission\
    \ must\n   be granted by the IESG, and code spaces with permission for early\n\
    \   allocation must be marked as such in the IANA registry.\n"
- title: 2.  Conditions for Early Allocation
  contents:
  - "2.  Conditions for Early Allocation\n   The following conditions must hold before\
    \ a request may be made for\n   early allocation of code points:\n   a) The code\
    \ points must be from a space designated as \"Standards\n      Action\", amended\
    \ by IESG approval to permit Early Allocation.\n   b) The format, semantics, processing,\
    \ and other rules related to\n      handling the protocol entities defined by\
    \ the code points\n      (henceforth called \"specifications\") must be adequately\
    \ described\n      in an Internet draft that is proposed as Standards Track.\n\
    \   c) The specifications of these code points must be stable; i.e., if\n    \
    \  there is a change, implementations based on the earlier and later\n      specifications\
    \ must be seamlessly interoperable.\n   d) There is sufficient interest in early\
    \ (pre-RFC) implementation and\n      deployment in the community.\n   If conditions\
    \ (a) or (b) are not met, then the processes in this memo\n   do not apply.\n"
- title: 3.  Process for Early Allocation
  contents:
  - "3.  Process for Early Allocation\n   There are three processes associated with\
    \ early allocation: making\n   the request for code points; following up on the\
    \ request; and\n   revoking an early allocation.  It cannot be emphasized enough\
    \ that\n   these processes must have a minimal impact on IANA itself, or they\n\
    \   will not be feasible.\n   The processes described below assume that the document\
    \ in question is\n   the product of an IETF Working Group.  If this is not the\
    \ case,\n   replace \"WG chairs\" below with \"shepherding Area Director\".\n"
- title: 3.1.  Request
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Request\n   The process for requesting and obtaining early allocation of\
    \ code\n   points is as follows:\n   1) The authors (editors) of the document\
    \ submit a request for early\n      allocation to the Working Group chairs, specifying\
    \ which code\n      points require early allocation and which document they should\
    \ be\n      assigned to.\n   2) The WG chairs determine whether the conditions\
    \ for early\n      allocations described in section 2 are met; particularly,\n\
    \      conditions (c) and (d).\n   3) The WG chairs gauge whether there is consensus\
    \ within the WG that\n      early allocation is appropriate in the case of the\
    \ given document.\n   4) If it is, with the approval of the Area Director(s),\
    \ the WG chairs\n      request IANA to make an early allocation.\n   5) IANA makes\
    \ an allocation from the appropriate registry, marking it\n      as \"temporary\"\
    , valid for a period of one year from the date of\n      allocation.  The date\
    \ of allocation should also be recorded in the\n      registry and made visible\
    \ to the public.\n   Note that Internet Drafts should not include a specific value\
    \ of a\n   code point until this value has been formally allocated by IANA.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Follow-Up
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Follow-Up\n   It is the responsibility of the document authors and the\
    \ Working\n   Group chairs to review changes in the document, and especially in\
    \ the\n   specifications of the code points for which early allocation was\n \
    \  requested, to ensure that the changes are backward compatible.\n   If at some\
    \ point changes that are not backward compatible are\n   nonetheless required,\
    \ a decision needs to be made as to whether\n   previously allocated code points\
    \ must be deprecated (see section 3.3\n   for more information on code point deprecation).\
    \  The considerations\n   include aspects such as the possibility of existing\
    \ deployments of\n   the older implementations and, hence, the possibility for\
    \ a collision\n   between older and newer implementations in the field.\n   If\
    \ the document progresses to the point at which IANA normally makes\n   code point\
    \ allocations, it is the responsibility of the authors and\n   the WG chairs to\
    \ remind IANA that there were early allocations, and\n   of the code point values\
    \ so allocated, in the IANA Considerations\n   section of the RFC-to-be.  Allocation\
    \ is then just a matter of\n   removing the \"temporary\" tag from the allocation\
    \ description.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Expiry
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Expiry\n   If early allocations expire before the document progresses to\
    \ the\n   point where IANA normally makes allocations, the authors and WG\n  \
    \ chairs may follow an abbreviated version of the process in section\n   3.1 to\
    \ request renewal of the code points.  At most, one renewal\n   request may be\
    \ made; thus, authors should choose carefully when the\n   original request is\
    \ to be made.\n   As an exception to the above rule, under rare circumstances,\
    \ more\n   than one allocation renewal may be justified.  All such renewal\n \
    \  requests must be reviewed by the IESG.  The renewal request to the\n   IESG\
    \ must include the reasons why such renewal is necessary, and the\n   WG's plans\
    \ regarding the specification.\n   If a follow-up request is not made, or the\
    \ document fails to progress\n   to a Standards Track RFC, the WG chairs are responsible\
    \ for informing\n   IANA that the code points are to be marked \"deprecated\"\
    \ (and are not\n   to be allocated).  The WG chairs are further responsible for\n\
    \   informing IANA when the deprecated code points can be completely de-\n   allocated\
    \ (i.e., made available for new allocations).\n   In particular, it is not IANA's\
    \ responsibility to track the status of\n   allocations, their expiration, or\
    \ when they may be re-allocated.\n   Note that if a document is submitted for\
    \ review to the IESG and at\n   the time of submission some early allocations\
    \ are valid (not\n   expired), these allocations should not be expired while the\
    \ document\n   is under IESG consideration or waiting in the RFC Editor's queue\n\
    \   after approval by the IESG.\n"

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   It is important to keep in mind 'denial of service'\
    \ attacks on IANA\n   as a result of the processes in this memo.  There are two\
    \ that are\n   immediately obvious: depletion of code space by early allocations\
    \ and\n   process overloading of IANA itself.  The processes described here\n\
    \   attempt to alleviate both of these, but they should be subject to\n   scrutiny\
    \ to ensure this.\n"
