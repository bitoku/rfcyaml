  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML)\
    \ Schema for\n   video fast update request in a tightly controlled environment,\n\
    \   developed by Microsoft, Polycom, Radvision and used by multiple\n   vendors.\
    \  Implementation of this schema for interactive video\n   applications in Session\
    \ Initiation Protocol (SIP) [5] environments\n   was designed in order to improve\
    \ user experience.  This mechanism is\n   being used by both end user video conferencing\
    \ terminals and\n   conferencing servers in shipping products.  This document\
    \ describes\n   the current method, but new implementations are discouraged from\n\
    \   using this method, except for backward compatibility with legacy\n   systems.\
    \  Shipping products and new products SHOULD use the Full\n   Intra Request, described\
    \ in [7].\n   Sending video fast update using the SIP signaling path, as described\n\
    \   in this document, is inferior to using the RTP Control Protocol\n   (RTCP)\
    \ feedback method [7], since the command flows through all the\n   proxies in\
    \ the signaling path adding delay to the messages and\n   causing unnecessary\
    \ overload to the proxies.  RTCP messages flow\n   end-to-end and not through\
    \ the signaling proxies.  The RTCP feedback\n   document [7] also adds other required\
    \ control functions, such as the\n   flow control command, which is missing from\
    \ this document.\n"

    \ 2119 [2].\n"
- title: 3.  Background
  contents:
  - "3.  Background\n   SIP typically uses the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)\
    \ [6] for the\n   transferring of real-time media.\n   RTP is augmented by a control\
    \ protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of\n   the data delivery in a manner scalable\
    \ to large multicast networks.\n   The RTCP feedback mechanism [8] has been introduced\
    \ in order to\n   improve basic RTCP feedback time in case of loss conditions\
    \ across\n   different coding schemes.  This technique addresses signaling of\
    \ loss\n   conditions and the recommended recovery steps.\n   Just recently, an\
    \ extension to the feedback mechanism has been\n   proposed [7] to express control\
    \ operations on media streams as a\n   result of application logic rather than\
    \ a result of loss conditions.\n   Note that in the decomposed systems, the implementation\
    \ of the new\n   mechanism will require proprietary communications between the\n\
    \   applications/call control components and the media components.\n   This document\
    \ describes a technology that has been deployed in\n   SIP-based systems over\
    \ the last three years and is being used across\n   real-time interactive applications\
    \ from different vendors in an\n   interoperable manner.  This memo documents\
    \ this technology for the\n   purpose of describing current practice and new implementation\
    \ MUST\n   use the RTCP Full Intra Request command specified in the RTCP-based\n\
    \   codec control messages document[7].\n"
- title: 4.  The Video Control Commands
  contents:
  - "4.  The Video Control Commands\n   Output of a video codec is a frame.  The frame\
    \ can carry complete\n   information about a picture or about a picture segment.\
    \  These frames\n   are known as \"Intra\" frames.  In order to save bandwidth,\
    \ other\n   frames can carry only changes relative to previously sent frames.\n\
    \   Frames carrying relative information are known as \"Inter\" frames.\n   Based\
    \ on application logic (such as need to present a new video\n   source), the application\
    \ needs to have an ability to explicitly\n   request from a remote encoder the\
    \ complete information about a \"full\"\n   picture.\n   An \"Intra\" frame may\
    \ be of large size.  In order to prevent causing\n   network congestion, the current\
    \ media capacity and network conditions\n   MUST be validated before sending an\
    \ \"Intra\" frame when receiving a\n   fast update command, defined in this document.\n\
    \   In order to meet the presented requirements, a video primitive is\n   defined\
    \ by this document.\n   The following command is sent to the remote encoder:\n\
    \   o  Video Picture Fast Update\n"

- title: 6.  Error Handling
  contents:
  - "6.  Error Handling\n   Currently, only a single general error primitive is defined.\
    \  It MAY\n   be used for indicating errors in free-text format.  The general\
    \ error\n   primitive MAY report problems regarding XML document parsing,\n  \
    \ inadequate level of media control support, inability to perform the\n   requested\
    \ action, etc.\n   The general error primitive MUST NOT be used for the indication\
    \ of\n   errors other than those related to media control parsing or to\n   resultant\
    \ execution.  The general error primitive MUST NOT be sent\n   back as a result\
    \ of getting an error primitive.\n   When receiving the general error response,\
    \ the user agent client\n   (UAC) that sent the request SHOULD NOT send further\
    \ fast update\n   requests in the current dialog.\n   According to RFC 2976 [3],\
    \ the only allowable final response to a SIP\n   INFO containing a message body\
    \ is a 200 OK.  If SIP INFO is used to\n   carry the request, the error message\
    \ should be carried in a separate\n   INFO request.\n"

- title: 10.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   The video control command transported using\
    \ the method described in\n   the document may cause the sender of the video data\
    \ to send more data\n   within the allowed bandwidth, as described in Section\
    \ 4.\n   This document defines one control message; changing the content of\n\
    \   the message will cause the video sender to ignore the request and\n   send\
    \ an error response.  This may prevent the display of a video\n   stream.  The\
    \ control message itself does not carry any sensitive\n   information.\n   An\
    \ eavesdropper may inject messages or change them, which may lead to\n   either\
    \ more data on the network or loss of video image.  Using data\n   integrity validation\
    \ will prevent adding or changing of messages.\n   If the video media is sent\
    \ over a secure transport, it is recommended\n   to secure the signaling using\
    \ TLS as explained in [5].  In most\n   cases, securing the media will require\
    \ a secure signaling path.\n   The security considerations of [3] and [5] apply\
    \ here.\n"
