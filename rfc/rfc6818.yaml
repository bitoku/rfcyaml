  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document updates the \"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure\n
    \  Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile\" [RFC5280].\n   This
    document makes a recommendation that self-signed certificates\n   used to convey
    trust anchor data be marked as certificate authority\n   (CA) certificates, which
    is not always current practice.\n   The use of self-signed certificates as trust
    anchors in Section 6.2\n   of [RFC5280] is clarified.  While it is optional to
    use additional\n   information in these certificates in the path validation process,\n
    \  [RFC5937] is noted as providing guidance in that regard.\n   The acceptable
    and unacceptable encodings for the explicitText field\n   of the user notice policy
    qualifier are updated to bring them in line\n   with existing practice.\n   The
    rules in Section 7.3 of [RFC5280] for ASCII encoding of\n   Internationalized
    Domain Names (IDNs) as Distinguished Names are\n   aligned with the rules in Section
    7.2 of that document that govern\n   IDN encoding as GeneralNames.\n   In light
    of some observed attacks [Prins], the Security\n   Considerations section now
    gives added depth to the consequences of\n   CA key compromise.  This section
    additionally notes that collision\n   resistance is not a required property of
    one-way hash functions when\n   used to generate key identifiers.\n   This document
    also adds normative and informative references for\n   Trust Anchor formats and
    how they may be used to initialize the path\n   validation inputs.  These are
    needed as a result of the changes made\n   in Section 4 of this document.\n"
