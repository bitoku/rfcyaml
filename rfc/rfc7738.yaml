  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)\
    \ [CCSDS] was\n   formed in 1982 by the major space agencies of the world to provide\
    \ a\n   forum for discussion of common problems in the development and\n   operation\
    \ of space data systems.  At the time of publication of this\n   document, it\
    \ is composed of eleven member agencies, twenty-eight\n   observer agencies, and\
    \ over 100 industrial associates.  Since its\n   establishment, CCSDS has been\
    \ actively developing recommendations for\n   data- and information-systems standards,\
    \ intended to promote\n   interoperability and cross support among cooperating\
    \ space agencies.\n   CCSDS has a permanent secretariat reporting to the CCSDS\
    \ Engineering\n   Steering Group, which maintains documents for the CCSDS protocols.\n\
    \   CCSDS also has its Naming Authority under the Space Assigned Number\n   Authority\
    \ (SANA) [SANA] that manages its registries and namespaces.\n   CCSDS produces\
    \ protocol standards documents requiring a permanent and\n   unique namespace.\
    \  CCSDS also uses Extensible Markup Language (XML)\n   schemas to define XML\
    \ messaging in its various protocols\n   recommendations.  These schemas require\
    \ a persistent, unique, and\n   location-independent namespace for identification\
    \ purposes.\n   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace identifier\n\
    \   (NID), as per [RFC3406].\n"

- title: 3.4.  Declaration of Syntactic Structure
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Declaration of Syntactic Structure\n   The formal syntax definitions below\
    \ are given in ABNF [RFC5234].\n   The namespace-specific string (NSS) in the\
    \ urn:ccsds names hierarchy\n   begins with a subnamespace identifier (SNID),\
    \ followed by a delimiter\n   and a subnamespace-dependent string\n   CCCSDS-URN\
    \ = \"urn:ccsds:\" SNID \":\" SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING\n   where <SNID> is\
    \ a unique subnamespace identifier for the\n   specification, and <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING>\
    \ is a unique\n   identifier within the subnamespace identifier scope.\n   <SNID>\
    \ has the same syntax as an <NID> as defined in [RFC2141].\n   SANA assigns SNIDs.\n\
    \   The syntax of <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING> is dependent on the\n   <SNID>\
    \ and MUST be defined by a CCSDS document.  This document does\n   not pose any\
    \ additional restrictions to the <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-\n   STRING> other than\
    \ what is defined in the NSS syntax as defined by\n   [RFC2141]:\n   SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING\
    \ = 1*<URN chars>\n   <URN chars> is defined in Section 2.2 of [RFC2141].\n"
- title: 3.5.  Relevant Ancillary Documentation
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Relevant Ancillary Documentation\n   SANA keeps the \"urn:ccsds\" namespace\
    \ as a registry [SANA-Reg].\n   Procedures to register a subnamespace identifier\
    \ are described in the\n   header of the registry.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Identifier Uniqueness Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Identifier Uniqueness Considerations\n   SANA is the authority responsible\
    \ for uniqueness of identifiers by\n   the recommendations of CCSDS.  SANA will\
    \ assign unique identifiers\n   and keep a public registry [SANA-Reg].\n"
- title: 3.7.  Identifier Persistence Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.7.  Identifier Persistence Considerations\n   CCSDS is committed to guaranteeing\
    \ the accessibility and persistence\n   of all the resources that are assigned\
    \ URNs.\n"
- title: 3.8.  Process of Identifier Assignment
  contents:
  - "3.8.  Process of Identifier Assignment\n   Assignment of identifiers is limited\
    \ to CCSDS and those authorities\n   explicitly designated by CCSDS.  CCSDS is\
    \ committed to assigning URN\n   identifiers only in accordance with the rules\
    \ specified in this\n   document or in future updates to this document, either\
    \ published as\n   IETF RFC documents or as CCSDS recommendations.\n"
- title: 3.9.  Process for Identifier Resolution
  contents:
  - "3.9.  Process for Identifier Resolution\n   The CCSDS namespace is not currently\
    \ listed with a Resolution\n   Discovery System (RDS), but nothing about the namespace\
    \ prohibits the\n   future definition of appropriate resolution methods or listing\
    \ with\n   an RDS.\n"
- title: 3.10.  Rules for Lexical Equivalence
  contents:
  - "3.10.  Rules for Lexical Equivalence\n   The <SNID> part of URNs in the CCSDS\
    \ hierarchy is case insensitive.\n   Thus, the <SNID> MUST be case normalized\
    \ before comparison.\n"
- title: 3.11.  Conformance with URN Syntax
  contents:
  - "3.11.  Conformance with URN Syntax\n   The intention of this document is to only\
    \ restrict the syntax of the\n   <SNID>.  The syntax of the <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING>\
    \ follows the\n   general syntax of a URN:\n   SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING =\
    \ 1*<URN chars>\n   Documents defining a subnamespace identifier SHOULD specify\
    \ further\n   syntactic restrictions in <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING>.  It is\n\
    \   RECOMMENDED that these documents forbid the assignment of URNs\n   containing\
    \ characters in the <reserved> set (\"%\", \"/\", \"?\", and \"#\")\n   as defined\
    \ in [RFC2141].  This is in accordance with Section 2.2 of\n   [RFC3986].\n"
- title: 3.12.  Validation Mechanism
  contents:
  - "3.12.  Validation Mechanism\n   The validation mechanism of URNs in the hierarchy\
    \ is specific for\n   each SNID and SHOULD be defined when an SNID is assigned.\n\
    \   URNs in the hierarchy without an assigned SNID are considered to be\n   invalid.\n"
- title: 3.13.  Scope
  contents:
  - "3.13.  Scope\n   Global URNs are relevant for the space agencies networks both\
    \ in\n   space and on Earth.\n"

  - "4.  Examples\n   URNs in this section are not guaranteed to be real and are listed\n\

  - "5.  Namespace Considerations\n   CCSDS is an international standards development\
    \ organization in the\n   field of space and Earth communications.  The use of\

    \ usage\n   for:\n      CCSDS documents\n      XML Schemas\n      CCSDS registries\n\
