  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Over the last two years, the attendance at Internet Engineering\
    \ Task\n   Force (IETF) Plenary meetings has grown phenomenally.  Approximately\n\
    \   38% of the attendees are new to the IETF at each meeting.  About 33%\n   of\
    \ those go on to become regular attendees.  When the meetings were\n   smaller,\
    \ it wasn't very difficult for a newcomer to get to know\n   people and get into\
    \ the swing of things.  Today, however, a newcomer\n   meets many more new people,\
    \ some previously known only as the authors\n   of Request For Comments (RFC)\
    \ documents or thought provoking email\n   messages.\n   The purpose of this For\
    \ Your Information (FYI) RFC is to explain to\n   the newcomers how the IETF works.\
    \  This will give them a warm, fuzzy\n   feeling and enable them to make the meeting\
    \ more productive for\n   everyone.  This FYI will also provide the mundane bits\
    \ of information\n   which everyone who attends an IETF meeting should know.\n"

- title: What is the IETF?
  contents:
  - "What is the IETF?\n   The Internet Engineering Task Force is a loosely self-organized\
    \ group\n   of people who make technical and other contributions to the\n   engineering\
    \ and evolution of the Internet and its technologies.  It\n   is the principal\
    \ body engaged in the development of new Internet\n   Standard specifications.\
    \  Its mission includes:\n   o  Identifying, and proposing solutions to, pressing\
    \ operational and\n      technical problems in the Internet;\n   o  Specifying\
    \ the development or usage of protocols and the near-term\n      architecture\
    \ to solve such technical problems for the Internet;\n   o  Making recommendations\
    \ to the Internet Engineering Steering Group\n      (IESG) regarding the standardization\
    \ of protocols and protocol\n      usage in the Internet;\n   o  Facilitating\
    \ technology transfer from the Internet Research Task\n      Force (IRTF) to the\
    \ wider Internet community; and\n   o  Providing a forum for the exchange of information\
    \ within the\n      Internet community between vendors, users, researchers, agency\n\
    \      contractors, and network managers.\n   The IETF Plenary meeting is not\
    \ a conference, although there are\n   technical presentations.  The IETF is not\
    \ a traditional standards\n   organization, although many standards are produced.\
    \  The IETF is the\n   volunteers who meet three times a year to fulfill the IETF\
    \ mission.\n   There is no membership in the IETF.  Anyone may register for and\n\
    \   attend any meeting.  The closest thing there is to being an IETF\n   member\
    \ is being on the IETF or Working Group mailing lists (see the\n   IETF Mailing\
    \ Lists section).  This is where the best information\n   about current IETF activities\
    \ and focus can be found.\n"
- title: Humble Beginnings
  contents:
  - "Humble Beginnings\n   The first IETF meeting was held in January, 1986 at Linkabit\
    \ in San\n   Diego with 15 attendees.  The 4th IETF, held at SRI in Menlo Park\
    \ in\n   October, 1986, was the first at which non-government vendors\n   attended.\
    \  The concept of Working Groups (WG) was introduced at the\n   5th IETF meeting\
    \ at the NASA Ames Research Center in California in\n   February, 1987.  The 7th\
    \ IETF, held at MITRE in McLean, Virginia in\n   July, 1987, was the first meeting\
    \ with over 100 attendees.\n   The 14th IETF meeting was held at Stanford University\
    \ in July, 1989.\n   It marked a major change in the structure of the IETF universe.\
    \  The\n   IAB (then Internet Activities Board, now Internet Architecture\n  \
    \ Board), which until that time oversaw many Task Forces, changed its\n   structure\
    \ to leave only two: the IETF and the IRTF.  The IRTF is\n   tasked to consider\
    \ the long-term research problems in the Internet.\n   The IETF also changed at\
    \ that time.\n   After the Internet Society (ISOC) was formed in January 1992,\
    \ the IAB\n   proposed to ISOC that the IAB's activities should take place under\n\
    \   the auspices of the Internet Society.  During INET92, in Kobe, Japan,\n  \
    \ the ISOC Trustees approved a new charter for the IAB to reflect the\n   proposed\
    \ relationship.\n   A recent first for the IETF was its first European meeting.\
    \  In July,\n   1993, the IETF met in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  The U.S./non-U.S.\n\
    \   attendees split was nearly 50/50.\n"
- title: The Hierarchy
  contents:
  - "The Hierarchy\n   To completely understand the structure of the IETF, it is useful\
    \ to\n   understand the overall structure in which the IETF resides.  There\n\
    \   are four groups in the structure: the ISOC and its Board of Trustees\n   (BOT),\
    \ the IAB, the IESG, and the IETF itself.\n   Internet standardization is an organized\
    \ activity of the ISOC.  The\n   ISOC is a professional society that is concerned\
    \ with the growth and\n   evolution of the worldwide Internet, with the way in\
    \ which the\n   Internet is and can be used, and with the social, political, and\n\
    \   technical issues which arise as a result.  The BOT is responsible for\n  \
    \ approving appointments to the IAB from among the nominees submitted\n   by the\
    \ IETF nominating committee.\n   The IAB is a technical advisory group of the\
    \ ISOC.  It is chartered\n   to provide oversight of the architecture of the Internet\
    \ and its\n   protocols, and to serve, in the context of the Internet Standards\n\
    \   process, as a body to which the decisions of the IESG may be\n   appealed.\
    \  The IAB is responsible for approving appointments to the\n   IESG from among\
    \ the nominees submitted by the IETF nominations\n   committee.\n   The IESG is\
    \ responsible for technical management of IETF activities\n   and the Internet\
    \ Standards process.  As part of the ISOC, it\n   administers the process according\
    \ to the rules and procedures which\n   have been ratified by the ISOC BOT.  The\
    \ IESG is directly responsible\n   for the actions associated with entry into\
    \ and movement along the\n   IETF \"standards track\", including final approval\
    \ of specifications as\n   Internet Standards.\n   The IETF is divided into nine\
    \ functional Areas.  They are:\n   Applications, Internet Services, Network Management,\
    \ Operational\n   Requirements, Routing, Security, Service Applications, Transport,\
    \ and\n   User Services.  Each Area has at least one Area Director.  There is\n\
    \   also an Area Director who oversees Standards Management.  The Area\n   Directors,\
    \ along with the IETF Chair, form the IESG.  Phillip Gross\n   has been the IETF\
    \ Chair since the IETF's 7th meeting.  He founded the\n   IESG and serves as its\
    \ Chair as well.\n   Each Area has several Working Groups.  A Working Group is\
    \ a group of\n   people who work under a charter to achieve a certain goal.  That\
    \ goal\n   may be the creation of an informational document, the creation of a\n\
    \   protocol standard, or the resolution of problems in the Internet.\n   Most\
    \ Working Groups have a finite lifetime.  That is, once a Working\n   Group has\
    \ achieved its goal, it disbands.  As in the IETF, there is\n   no official membership\
    \ for a Working Group.  Unofficially, a Working\n   Group member is somebody who's\
    \ on that Working Group's mailing list;\n   however, anyone may attend a Working\
    \ Group meeting (see the Be\n   Prepared section below).\n   Areas may also have\
    \ Birds of a Feather (BOF) groups.  They generally\n   have the same goals as\
    \ Working Groups, except that they have no\n   charter and usually only meet once\
    \ or twice.  BOFs are often held to\n   determine if there is enough interest\
    \ to form a Working Group.\n"
- title: IETF Mailing Lists
  contents:
  - "IETF Mailing Lists\n   Anyone who plans to attend an IETF meeting should join\
    \ the IETF\n   announcements mailing list.  This is where all of the meeting\n\
    \   information, new and revised Internet-Draft and RFC announcements,\n   IESG\
    \ Recommendations, and Last Calls are posted.  People who'd like\n   to \"get\
    \ technical\" may also join the IETF discussion list,\n   \"ietf@cnri.reston.va.us\"\
    .  This was the only list before the\n   announcement list was created and is\
    \ where discussions of cosmic\n   significance are held (most Working Groups have\
    \ their own mailing\n   lists for discussions relating to their work).  To join\
    \ the IETF\n   announcement list, send a request to:\n        ietf-announce-request@cnri.reston.va.us\n\
    \   To join the IETF discussion list, send a request to:\n        ietf-request@cnri.reston.va.us\n\
    \   To join both of the lists, simply send a single message, to either\n   \"\
    -request\" address, and indicate that you'd like to join both lists.\n   Do not,\
    \ ever, under any circumstances, for any reason, send a request\n   to join a\
    \ list to the list itself!  The thousands of people on the\n   list don't need,\
    \ or want, to know when a new person joins.\n   Similarly, when changing email\
    \ addresses or leaving a list, send your\n   request only to the \"-request\"\
    \ address, not to the main list.  This\n   means you!!\n   The IETF discussion\
    \ list is unmoderated.  This means that anyone can\n   express their opinions\
    \ about issues affecting the Internet.  However,\n   it is not a place for companies\
    \ or individuals to solicit or\n   advertise.  Only the Secretariat can send a\
    \ message to the\n   announcement list.\n   Even though the IETF mailing lists\
    \ \"represent\" the IETF membership at\n   large, it is important to note that\
    \ attending an IETF meeting does\n   not automatically include addition to either\
    \ mailing list.\n"
- title: Registration
  contents:
  - "Registration\n   As previously mentioned, all meeting announcements are sent\
    \ to the\n   IETF announcement list.  Within the IETF meeting announcement is\
    \ a\n   Registration Form and complete instructions for registering,\n   including,\
    \ of course, the cost.  The Secretariat highly recommends\n   that attendees preregister.\
    \  Early registration, which ends about one\n   month before the meeting, carries\
    \ a lower registration fee.  As the\n   size of the meetings has grown, so has\
    \ the length of the lines at the\n   registration desk.  Fortunately, there are\
    \ three lines:\n   \"preregistered and prepaid\" (which moves very quickly),\n\
    \   \"preregistered and on-site payment\" (which moves a little more\n   slowly),\
    \ and \"registration and on-site payment\" (take a guess).\n   Registration is\
    \ open all week.  However, the Secretariat highly\n   recommends that attendees\
    \ arrive for early registration, beginning at\n   6:00 P.M. (meeting local time),\
    \ on the Sunday before the opening\n   plenary.  Not only will there be fewer\
    \ people, but there will also be\n   a reception at which people can get a byte\
    \ to eat.  If the\n   registration lines are long, one can eat first and try again\
    \ when the\n   lines are shorter.\n   Registered attendees (and there isn't any\
    \ other kind) receive a\n   Registration Packet.  It contains a general orientation\
    \ sheet, the\n   At-A-Glance sheet, a list of Working Group acronyms, the most\
    \ recent\n   Agenda, and a name tag.  The At-A-Glance is a very important\n  \
    \ reference and is used throughout the week.  It contains Working\n   Group/BOF\
    \ room assignments and a map of room locations.  Attendees\n   who prepaid will\
    \ also find their receipt in their packet.\n"
- title: Newcomers' Orientation
  contents:
  - "Newcomers' Orientation\n   Newcomers are encouraged to attend the IETF Newcomers'\
    \ Orientation.\n   As the name implies, it is an orientation for first time attendees\
    \ to\n   IETF meetings.  The orientation is organized and conducted by the\n \
    \  IETF Secretariat and is intended to provide useful introductory\n   information.\
    \  The Secretariat tries to keep the orientation session\n   informal, and is\
    \ usually successful at it.\n   The orientation is typically 30-45 minutes long\
    \ and covers a number\n   of topics: what's in the attendee packets, what all\
    \ the dots on name\n   tags mean, and how to read the At-A-Glance.  There is also\
    \ discussion\n   about the organization of the IETF: Working Groups and their\
    \ Areas,\n   and the IESG.  There is ample time at the end for questions.  The\n\
    \   Secretariat also provides handouts which include the text from the\n   IETF\
    \ Overview and a list of important files maintained on the IETF\n   Shadow directories.\n\
    \   The orientation is held on Sunday afternoon and ends about 30 mintues\n  \
    \ before the Registration Reception.  However, attending the\n   orientation does\
    \ NOT mean you can go to the reception early!\n"
- title: Dress Code
  contents:
  - "Dress Code\n   Since attendees must wear their name tags, they must also wear\
    \ shirts\n   or blouses.  Pants or skirts are also highly recommended.  Seriously\n\
    \   though, many newcomers are often embarrassed when they show up Monday\n  \
    \ morning in suits, to discover that everybody else is wearing T-\n   shirts,\
    \ jeans (shorts, if weather permits) and sandals.  There are\n   those in the\
    \ IETF who refuse to wear anything other than suits.\n   Fortunately, they are\
    \ well known (for other reasons) so they are\n   forgiven this particular idiosyncrasy.\
    \  The general rule is \"dress\n   for the weather\" (unless you plan to work\
    \ so hard that you won't go\n   outside, in which case, \"dress for comfort\"\
    \ is the rule!).\n"
- title: Seeing Spots Before Your Eyes
  contents:
  - "Seeing Spots Before Your Eyes\n   Some of the people at the IETF will have a\
    \ little colored dot on\n   their name tag.  A few people have more than one.\
    \  These dots\n   identify people who are silly enough to volunteer to do a lot\
    \ of\n   extra work.  The colors have the following meanings:\n      red    -\
    \ IAB member\n      yellow - IESG member\n      blue   - Working Group/BOF chair\n\
    \      green  - Local host\n   Local hosts are the people who can answer questions\
    \ about the\n   terminal room, restaurants, and points of interest in the area.\n\
    \   Some people have Gold Stars on their name tags.  The stars indicate\n   that\
    \ those people chaired Working Groups or BOFs in the IETF Area\n   which submitted\
    \ all of its Working Group/BOF Minutes and Area Report\n   from the previous meeting\
    \ first.  The stars are the Secretariat's way\n   of saying \"Thank You\" for\
    \ providing the necessary information\n   quickly.\n   It is important that newcomers\
    \ to the IETF not be afraid to strike up\n   conversations with people who wear\
    \ these dots.  If the IAB and IESG\n   members, and Working Group and BOF chairs,\
    \ didn't want to talk to\n   anybody, they wouldn't be wearing the dots in the\
    \ first place.\n   To make life simpler for the Secretariat, Registration Packets\

    \   use, so nobody else needs to worry about them.  Please, don't peel\n   them\
    \ off your packet and put them on your name tag.\n"
- title: Terminal Room
  contents:
  - "Terminal Room\n   One of the most important (depending on your point of view)\
    \ things\n   the local host does is provide Internet access to the meeting\n \
    \  attendees.  In general, the connectivity is excellent.  This is\n   entirely\
    \ due to the Olympian efforts of the local hosts, and their\n   ability to beg,\
    \ borrow and steal.  The people and companies who\n   donate their equipment,\
    \ services, and time are to be heartily\n   congratulated and thanked.\n   While\
    \ preparation far in advance of the meeting is encouraged, there\n   may be some\
    \ unavoidable \"last minute\" things which can be\n   accomplished in the terminal\
    \ room.  It may also be useful to people\n   who need to make trip reports or\
    \ status reports while things are\n   still fresh in their minds.\n"
- title: Social Event
  contents:
  - "Social Event\n   Another of the most important things organized and managed by\
    \ the\n   local hosts is the IETF social event.  The social event has become\n\
    \   something of a tradition at the IETF meetings.  It has been\n   immortalized\
    \ by Marshal Rose with his reference to \"many fine lunches\n   and dinners\"\
    \ [ROSE], and by Claudio and Julia Topolcic with their\n   rendition of \"Nerds\
    \ in Paradise\" on a pink T-shirt.\n   Newcomers to the IETF are encouraged to\
    \ attend the social event.\n   Everyone is encouraged to wear their name tags.\
    \  The social event is\n   designed to give people a chance to meet on a social,\
    \ rather than\n   technical, level.\n   Sometimes, the social event is a computer\
    \ or high-tech related event.\n   At the Boston IETF, for example, the social\
    \ was dinner at the\n   Computer Museum.  Other times, the social might be a dinner\
    \ cruise or\n   a trip to an art gallery.\n"
- title: Agenda
  contents:
  - "Agenda\n   The Agenda for the IETF meetings is a very fluid thing.  It is sent,\n\
    \   in various forms, to the IETF announcement list three times prior to\n   the\
    \ meeting.  The final Agenda is included in the Registration\n   Packets.  Of\
    \ course, \"final\" in the IETF doesn't mean the same thing\n   as it does elsewhere\
    \ in the world.  The final Agenda is simply the\n   version that went to the printers.\n\
    \   The Secretariat will announce Agenda changes during the morning\n   plenary\
    \ sessions.  Changes will also be posted on the bulletin board\n   near the IETF\
    \ Registration Table (not the hotel registration desk).\n   Assignments for breakout\
    \ rooms (that's where the Working Groups and\n   BOFs meet) and a map showing\
    \ the room locations make up the At-A-\n   Glance sheet (included in the Registration\
    \ Packets).  Room\n   assignments are as flexible as the Agenda.  Some Working\
    \ Groups meet\n   multiple times during a meeting and every attempt is made to\
    \ have a\n   Working Group meet in the same room each session.  Room assignment\n\
    \   changes are not necessarily permanent for the week.  Always check the\n  \
    \ At-A-Glance first, then the bulletin board.  When in doubt, check\n   with a\
    \ member of the Secretariat at the Registration Table.\n"
- title: Other General Things
  contents:
  - "Other General Things\n   The opening Plenary on Monday morning is the most heavily\
    \ attended\n   session.  It is where important introductory remarks are made,\
    \ so\n   people are encouraged to attend.\n   The IETF Secretariat, and IETFers\
    \ in general, are very approachable.\n   Never be afraid to approach someone and\
    \ introduce yourself.  Also,\n   don't be afraid to ask questions, especially\
    \ when it comes to jargon\n   and acronyms!\n   Hallway conversations are very\
    \ important.  A lot of very good work\n   gets done by people who talk together\
    \ between meetings and over\n   lunches and dinners.  Every minute of the IETF\
    \ can be considered work\n   time (much to some people's dismay).\n   A \"Bar\
    \ BOF\" is an unofficial get-together, usually in the late\n   evening, during\
    \ which a lot of work gets done over drinks.\n   It's unwise to get between a\
    \ hungry IETFer (and there isn't any other\n   kind) and coffee break brownies\
    \ and cookies, no matter how\n   interesting a hallway conversation is.\n   IETFers\
    \ are fiercely independent.  It's safe to question opinions and\n   offer alternatives,\
    \ but don't expect an IETFer to follow orders.\n   The IETF, and the plenary sessions\
    \ in particular, are not places for\n   vendors to try to sell their wares.  People\

    \ this RFC twice!\n   This is the \"very important registration bullets\" section.\n\
    \   o  To attend an IETF meeting: you have to register and you have to\n     \
    \ pay the registration fee.\n   o  All you need to do to be registered is to send\
    \ in a completed\n      Registration Form.\n   o  You may register by mail, email\
    \ or fax.  Generally, email and fax\n      registration forms will be accepted\
    \ until 1:00 P.M. ET on the\n      Friday before the meeting.\n   o  You may preregister\
    \ and pay, preregister and pay later,\n      preregister and pay on-site, or register\
    \ and pay on-site.\n   o  To get the lower registration fee, you must register\
    \ by the early\n      registration deadline (about one month before the meeting).\
    \  You\n      can still pay later or on-site.\n   o  If you don't register by\
    \ the early registration deadline, a late\n      fee is added.\n   o Everyone\
    \ pays the same fees.  There are no educational or group\n      discounts.  There\
    \ are no discounts for attending only part of the\n      week.\n   o  Register\
    \ only ONE person per registration form.  Substitutions are\n      NOT allowed.\n\
    \   o  You may register then pay later, but you may not pay then register\n  \
    \    later.  Payment MUST be accompanied by a completed registration\n      form.\n\
    \   o  Purchase orders are NOT accepted.  DD Form 1556 is accepted.\n      Invoice\
    \ for payment cannot be accepted.\n   o  Refunds are subject to a $20 service\
    \ charge.  Late fees will not\n      be refunded.\n   o  The registration fee\

- title: Mailing Lists and Archives
  contents:
  - "Mailing Lists and Archives\n   As previously mentioned, the IETF announcement\
    \ and discussion mailing\n   lists are the central mailing lists for IETF activities.\
    \  However,\n   there are many other mailing lists related to IETF work.  For\n\
    \   example, every Working Group has its own discussion list.  In\n   addition,\
    \ there are some long-term technical debates which have been\n   moved off of\
    \ the IETF list onto lists created specifically for those\n   topics.  It is highly\
    \ recommended that everybody follow the\n   discussions on the mailing lists of\
    \ the Working Groups which they\n   wish to attend.  The more work that is done\
    \ on the mailing lists, the\n   less work that will need to be done at the meeting,\
    \ leaving time for\n   cross pollination (i.e., attending Working Groups outside\
    \ one's\n   primary area of interest in order to broaden one's perspective).\n\
    \   The mailing lists also provide a forum for those who wish to follow,\n   or\
    \ contribute to, the Working Groups' efforts, but cannot attend the\n   IETF meetings.\n\
    \   All IETF discussion lists have a \"-request\" address which handles the\n\
    \   administrative details of joining and leaving the list.  It is\n   generally\
    \ frowned upon when such administrivia appears on the\n   discussion mailing list.\n\
    \   Most IETF discussion lists are archived.  That is, all of the\n   messages\
    \ sent to the list are automatically stored on a host for\n   anonymous FTP access.\
    \  To find out where a particular list is\n   archived, send a message to the\

- title: InterNIC Archives
  contents:
  - "InterNIC Archives\n   There is a tremendous amount of material available for\
    \ those who\n   follow the work of the IETF.  To make it easier to know what to\
    \ read\n   to prepare for a meeting, the InterNIC has established a document\n\
    \   archive.  Beginning about one month prior to an IETF meeting, Working\n  \
    \ Group/BOF Chairs and Area Directors put documents relevent to the\n   discussions\
    \ to be held into the archives.  Those people who plan to\n   attend a Working\
    \ Group/BOF session should check the archives for\n   documents which need to\
    \ be read.  The documents are left in the\n   archives for about two months after\
    \ the end of the IETF meeting.\n   On the host \"ds.internic.net\", documents\
    \ are stored in the directory\n   \"/pub/current-ietf-docs\" under subdirectories\
    \ named for each Area and\n   then for each Working Group.  For example, a document\
    \ for the NISI\n   Working Group, which is in the User Services Area, would be\
    \ stored as\n   \"current-ietf-docs/usv/nisi/nisi-doc1.txt\".  Each Area will\
    \ also have\n   a subdirectory called \"bof\", where documents to be discussed\
    \ in BOF\n   sessions will be placed.  A directory called \"plenary\" will also\
    \ be\n   created under \"/pub/current-ietf-docs\" to put documents or viewgraphs\n\
    \   related to a plenary session.  Any filename conflicts will be\n   resolved\
    \ by the archive administrator working with the submitter of\n   the document\
    \ via email.\n   It is important to note that the service is provided by the InterNIC\n\

- title: Be Prepared
  contents:
  - "Be Prepared\n   This topic cannot be stressed enough.  As the IETF grows, it\
    \ becomes\n   more and more important for attendees to arrive prepared for the\n\
    \   Working Group meetings they plan to attend.  This doesn't apply only\n   to\
    \ newcomers; everybody should come prepared.\n   Being prepared means having read\
    \ the documents which the Working\n   Group or BOF Chair has distributed.  It\
    \ means having followed the\n   discussions on the Working Group's mailing list\
    \ or having reviewed\n   the archives.  For the Working Group/BOF Chairs, it means\
    \ getting all\n   of the documents out early (i.e., several weeks) to give everybody\n\
    \   time to read them and announcing an agenda and sticking to it.\n   At the\
    \ Chair's discretion, some time may be devoted to bringing new\n   Working Group\
    \ attendees up to speed.  In fact, long lived Working\n   Groups have occasionally\
    \ held entire sessions which were introductory\n   in nature.  As a rule, however,\
    \ a Working Group is not the place to\n   go for training.  Observers are always\
    \ welcome, but they must realize\n   that the work effort cannot be delayed for\
    \ education.  Anyone wishing\n   to attend a Working Group for the first time\
    \ might seek out the Chair\n   prior to the meeting and ask for some introduction.\n\
    \   Another thing, for everybody, to consider is that Working Groups go\n   through\
    \ phases.  In the initial phase (say, the first two meetings),\n   all ideas are\
    \ welcome.  The idea is to gather all the possible\n   solutions together for\
    \ consideration.  In the development phase, a\n   solution is chosen and developed.\
    \  Trying to reopen issues which were\n   decided more than a couple of meetings\
    \ back is considered bad form.\n   The final phase (the last two meetings) is\
    \ where the \"spit and\n   polish\" are applied to the architected solution. \
    \ This is not the\n   time to suggest architectural changes or open design issues\
    \ already\n   resolved.  It's a bad idea to wait until the last minute to speak\
    \ out\n   if a problem is discovered.  This is especially true for people whose\n\
    \   excuse is that they hadn't read the documents until the day before a\n   comments\
    \ period ended.\n   Time at the IETF meetings is a precious thing.  Working Groups\
    \ are\n   encouraged to meet between IETF meetings, either in person or by\n \
    \  video or telephone conference.  Doing as much work as possible over\n   the\
    \ mailing lists would also reduce the amount of work which must be\n   done at\
    \ the meeting.\n"
- title: RFCs and Internet-Drafts
  contents:
  - "RFCs and Internet-Drafts\n   Originally, RFCs were just what the name implies;\
    \ they were requests\n   for comments.  The early RFCs were messages between the\
    \ ARPANET\n   architects about how to resolve certain problems.  Over the years,\n\
    \   RFCs became more formal.  It reached the point that they were being\n   cited\
    \ as standards, even when they weren't.\n   To help clear up some confusion, there\
    \ are now two special sub-series\n   within the RFCs: FYIs and STDs.  The For\
    \ Your Information RFC sub-\n   series was created to document overviews and topics\
    \ which are\n   introductory.  Frequently, FYIs are created by groups within the\
    \ IETF\n   User Services Area.  The STD RFC sub-series was created to identify\n\
    \   those RFCs which do in fact specify Internet Standards.\n   Every RFC, including\
    \ FYIs and STDs, have an RFC number by which they\n   are indexed and by which\
    \ they can be retrieved.  FYIs and STDs have\n   FYI numbers and STD numbers,\
    \ respectively, in addition to RFC\n   numbers.  This makes it easier for a new\
    \ Internet user, for example,\n   to find all of the helpful, informational documents\
    \ by looking for\n   the FYIs amongst all the RFCs.  If an FYI or STD is revised,\
    \ its RFC\n   number will change, but its FYI or STD number will remain contant\
    \ for\n   ease of reference.\n   There is also an RTR subseries of RFCs for Reseaux\
    \ Associes pour la\n   Recherche Europeenne (RARE) Technical Reports.  These are\
    \ technical\n   reports developed in the RARE community that are published as\
    \ RFCs to\n   provide easy access to the general Internet community.\n   Internet-Drafts\
    \ (I-D) are working documents of the IETF.  Any group\n   (e.g., Working Group,\
    \ BOF) or individual may submit a document for\n   distribution as an I-D.  An\
    \ I-D is valid for six months.  Guidelines\n   require that an expiration date\
    \ appear on every page of an I-D.  An\n   I-D may be updated, replaced or obsoleted\
    \ at any time.  It is not\n   appropriate to use I-Ds as reference material or\
    \ to cite them, other\n   than as a \"working draft\" or \"work in progress\"\
    .\n   For additional information, read the following documents:\n   o  Request\
    \ for Comments on Request for Comments [RFC1111]\n   o  F.Y.I. on F.Y.I: Introduction\
