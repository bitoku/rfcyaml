  - "Abstract\n   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) REFER extension as defined
    in\n   RFC 3515 automatically establishes a typically short-lived event\n   subscription
    used to notify the party sending a REFER request about\n   the receiver's status
    in executing the transaction requested by the\n   REFER.  These notifications
    are not needed in all cases.  This\n   specification provides a way to prevent
    the automatic establishment\n   of an event subscription and subsequent notifications
    using a new SIP\n   extension header field that may be included in a REFER request.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The REFER specification [3] specifies that every REFER creates
    an\n   implicit subscription between the REFER-Issuer and the REFER-\n   Recipient.\n
    \  This document defines a new SIP header field: \"Refer-Sub\" meaningful\n   within
    a REFER transaction only.  This header field, when set to\n   \"false\", specifies
    that a REFER-Issuer requests that the REFER-\n   Recipient doesn't establish an
    implicit subscription and the\n   resultant dialog.\n   This document defines
    a new option tag: \"norefersub\".  This tag, when\n   included in the Supported
    header field, indicates that a User Agent\n   (UA) is capable of accepting a REFER
    request without creating an\n   implicit subscription when acting as a REFER-Recipient.\n"

    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].\n   To
    simplify discussions of the REFER method and its extensions, the\n   three terms
    below are being used throughout the document:\n   o  REFER-Issuer: the UA issuing
    the REFER request\n   o  REFER-Recipient: the UA receiving the REFER request\n
    \  o  REFER-Target: the UA designated in the Refer-To Uniform Resource\n      Identifier
    (URI)\n"
  title: 2.  Terminology
- contents:
  - "3.  Motivation\n   The REFER specification mandates that every REFER creates
    an implicit\n   subscription between the REFER-Issuer and the REFER-Recipient.
    \ This\n   subscription results in at least one NOTIFY being sent from the\n   REFER-Recipient
    to the REFER-Issuer.  The REFER-Recipient may choose\n   to cancel the implicit
    subscription with this NOTIFY.  The REFER-\n   Issuer may choose to cancel this
    implicit subscription with an\n   explicit SUBSCRIBE (Expires: 0) after receipt
    of the initial NOTIFY.\n   One purpose of requiring the implicit subscription
    and initial NOTIFY\n   is to allow for the situation where the REFER request gets
    forked and\n   the REFER-Issuer needs a way to see the multiple dialogs that may
    be\n   established as a result of the forked REFER.  This is the same\n   approach
    used to handle forking of SUBSCRIBE [4] requests.  Where the\n   REFER-Issuer
    explicitly specifies that forking not occur, the\n   requirement that an implicit
    subscription be established is\n   unnecessary.\n   Another purpose of the NOTIFY
    is to inform the REFER-Issuer of the\n   progress of the SIP transaction that
    results from the REFER at the\n   REFER-Recipient.  In the case where the REFER-Issuer
    is already aware\n   of the progress of the requested operation, such as when
    the REFER-\n   Issuer has an explicit subscription to the dialog event package
    at\n   the REFER-Recipient, the implicit subscription and resultant NOTIFY\n   traffic
    related to the REFER can create an unnecessary network\n   overhead.\n"
  title: 3.  Motivation
- contents:
  - "4.  Definitions\n   This document defines a new SIP header field: \"Refer-Sub\".
    \ This\n   header field is meaningful and MAY be used with a REFER request and\n
    \  the corresponding 2XX response only.  This header field set to\n   \"false\"
    specifies that a REFER-Issuer requests that the REFER-\n   Recipient doesn't establish
    an implicit subscription and the\n   resultant dialog.  Note that when using this
    extension, the REFER\n   remains a target refresh request (as in the default case
    -- when the\n   extension is not used).\n   This document adds the following entry
    to Table 2 of [2].  The\n   additions to this table are also provided for extension
    methods at\n   the time of publication of this document.  This is provided as
    a\n   courtesy to the reader and is not normative in any way:\n   Header field
    \       where    proxy ACK  BYE  CAN  INV  OPT  REG  MSG\n   Refer-Sub           R,
    2xx          -    -    -    -    -    -    -\n   Header field        where    SUB
    \ NOT  REF  INF  UPD  PRA  PUB\n   Refer-Sub           R, 2xx    -    -    o    -
    \   -    -    -\n   The Refer-Sub header field MAY be encrypted as part of end-to-end\n
    \  encryption.\n   The syntax of the header field follows the BNF defined below:\n
    \   Refer-Sub       = \"Refer-Sub\" HCOLON refer-sub-value *(SEMI exten)\n    refer-sub-value
    = \"true\" / \"false\"\n    exten           = generic-param\n   where the syntax
    of generic-param is defined in [2].\n   The \"Refer-Sub\" header field set to
    \"false\" MAY be used by the REFER-\n   Issuer only when the REFER-Issuer can
    be certain that the REFER\n   request will not be forked.\n   If the REFER-Recipient
    supports the extension and is willing to\n   process the REFER transaction without
    establishing an implicit\n   subscription, it MUST insert the \"Refer-Sub\" header
    field set to\n   \"false\" in the 2xx response to the REFER-Issuer.  In this case,
    no\n   implicit subscription is created.  Consequently, no new dialog is\n   created
    if this REFER was issued outside any existing dialog.\n   If the REFER-Issuer
    inserts the \"Refer-Sub\" header field set to\n   \"false\", but the REFER-Recipient
    doesn't grant the suggestion (i.e.,\n   either does not include the \"Refer-Sub\"
    header field or includes the\n   \"Refer-Sub\" header field set to \"true\" in
    the 2xx response), an\n   implicit subscription is created as in the default case.\n
    \  This document also defines a new option tag, \"norefersub\".  This tag,\n   when
    included in the Supported header field, specifies that a User\n   Agent (UA) is
    capable of accepting a REFER request without creating\n   an implicit subscription
    when acting as a REFER-Recipient.\n   The REFER-Issuer can know the capabilities
    of the REFER-Recipient\n   from the presence of the option tags in the Supported
    header field of\n   the dialog initiating request or response.  Another way of
    learning\n   the capabilities would be by using presence, such as defined in [6].\n
    \  However, if the capabilities of the REFER-Recipient are not known,\n   using
    the \"norefersub\" tag with the Require header field is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  This
    is due to the fact that in the event the REFER-\n   Recipient doesn't support
    the extension, in order to fall back to the\n   normal REFER, the REFER-Issuer
    will need to issue a new REFER\n   transaction thus resulting in additional round-trips.\n
    \  As described in Section 8.2.2.3 in [2], a REFER-Recipient will reject\n   a
    REFER request containing a Require: norefersub header field with a\n   420 (Bad
    Extension) response unless it supports this extension.  Note\n   that Require:
    norefersub can be present with a Refer-Sub: false\n   header field.\n"

  - "5.  Preventing Forking of REFER Requests\n   The REFER specification allows for
    the possibility of forking a REFER\n   request that is sent outside of an existing
    dialog.  In addition, a\n   proxy may fork an unknown method type.  Should forking
    occur, the\n   sender of the REFER with \"Refer-Sub\" will not be aware as only
    a\n   single 2xx response will be forwarded by the forking proxy.  As a\n   result,
    the responsibility is on the issuer of the REFER with \"Refer-\n   Sub\" to ensure
    that no forking will result.\n   If a REFER request to a given Request-URI might
    fork, the REFER-\n   Issuer SHOULD NOT include the \"Refer-Sub\" header field.
    \ The REFER-\n   Issuer SHOULD use standardized mechanisms for ensuring the REFER\n
    \  request does not fork.  In absence of any other mechanism, the\n   Request-URI
    of the REFER request SHOULD have Globally Routable User\n   Agent URI (GRUU) properties
    according to the definitions of [5] as\n   those properties ensure the request
    will not fork.\n"

  - "7.  IANA Considerations\n   This document registers a new SIP header field \"Refer-Sub\".
    \ This\n   header field is only meaningful for the REFER request defined in RFC\n
    \  3515 [3] and the corresponding response.  The following information\n   has
    been added to the SIP Header field sub-registry in the SIP\n   Parameters Registry:\n
    \  o  Header Name: Refer-Sub\n   o  Compact Form: None\n   o  Reference: RFC 4488\n
    \  This document also registers a new SIP option tag, \"norefersub\",\n   adding
    it to the SIP Option Tags sub-registry in the SIP Parameters\n   Registry.  The
    required information for this registration, as\n   specified in RFC 3261 [2],
    is:\n   o  Name: norefersub\n   o  Description: This option tag specifies a User
    Agent ability of\n      accepting a REFER request without establishing an implicit\n
    \     subscription (compared to the default case defined in RFC 3515\n      [3]).\n"
  title: 7.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   The purpose of this SIP extension is to modify
    the expected behavior\n   of the REFER-Recipient.  The change in behavior is for
    the REFER-\n   Recipient not to establish a dialog and not to send NOTIFY messages\n
    \  back to the REFER-Issuer.  As such, a malicious inclusion of a\n   \"Refer-Sub\"
    header field set to \"false\" reduces the processing and\n   state requirements
    on the recipient.  As a result, its use in a\n   denial-of-service attack seems
    limited.\n   On the other hand, by inserting a \"Refer-Sub\" header field set
    to\n   \"false\", a man-in-the-middle (MitM) can potentially exploit the\n   mechanism
    for easier (than an interception) suppression of the\n   notifications from the
    REFER-Receiver without the REFER-Issuer\n   noticing it.  Also, by removing a
    \"Refer-Sub\" header field set to\n   \"false\", a MitM can cause the REFER-Receiver
    to generate\n   notifications over the implicit dialog that otherwise had been\n
    \  suppressed by the REFER-Issuer.\n   To protect against these kinds of MitM
    attacks, integrity protection\n   should be used.  For example, the REFER-Issuer
    could use S/MIME as\n   discussed in RFC 3261 [2] to protect against these kinds
    of attacks.\n"
