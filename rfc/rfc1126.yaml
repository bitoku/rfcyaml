- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The development of an inter-autonomous systems routing protocol\n\
    \   proceeds from those goals and functions seen as both desirable and\n   obtainable\
    \ for the Internet environment.  This document describes\n   these goals and functional\
    \ requirements.  The goals and functional\n   requirements addressed by this document\
    \ are intended to provide a\n   context within which an inter-autonomous system\
    \ routing architecture\n   can be developed which will meet both current and future\
    \ Internet\n   routing needs.  The goals presented indicate properties and general\n\
    \   capabilities desired of the Internet routing environment and what the\n  \
    \ inter-autonomous system routing architecture is to accomplish as a\n   whole.\n\
    \   The goals are followed by functional requirements, which address\n   either\
    \ detailed objectives or specific functionality to be achieved\n   by the architecture\
    \ and resulting protocol(s).  These functional\n   requirements are enumerated\
    \ for clarity and grouped so as to map\n   directly to areas of architectural\
    \ consideration.  This is followed\n   by a listing and description of general\
    \ objectives, such as\n   robustness, which are applicable in a broad sense. \
    \ Specific\n   functions which are not reasonably attainable or best left to future\n\
    \   efforts are identified as non-requirements.\n   The intent of this document\
    \ is to provide both the goals and\n   functional requirements in a concise fashion.\
    \  Supporting arguments,\n   tradeoff considerations and the like have been purposefully\
    \ omitted\n   in support of this.  An appendix has been included which addresses\n\
    \   this omission to a limited extent and the reader is directed there\n   for\
    \ a more detailed discussion of the issues involved.\n   The goals and functional\
    \ requirements contained in this document are\n   the result of work done by the\
    \ members of the Open Routing Working\n   Group.  It is our intention that these\
    \ goals and requirements reflect\n   not only those foreseen in the Internet community\
    \ but are also\n   similar to those encountered in environments proposed by ANSI,\
    \ ECMA\n   and ISO.  It is expected that there will be some interaction and\n\
    \   relationship between this work and the product of these groups.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Overall Goals\n   In order to derive a set functional requirements there\
    \ must be one or\n   more principals or overall goals for the routing environment\
    \ to\n   satisfy.  These high level goals provide the basis for each of the\n\
    \   functional requirements we have derived and will guide the design\n   philosophy\
    \ for achieving an inter-autonomous system routing solution.\n   The overall goals\
    \ we are utilizing are described in the following\n   sections.\n"
- title: 2.1  Route to Destination
  contents:
  - "2.1  Route to Destination\n   The routing architecture will provide for the routing\
    \ of datagrams\n   from a single source to one or more destinations in a timely\
    \ manner.\n   The larger goal is to provide datagram delivery to an identifiable\n\
    \   destination, one which is not necessarily immediately reachable by\n   the\
    \ source.  In particular, routing is to address the needs of a\n   single source\
    \ requiring datagram delivery to one or more\n   destinations.  The concepts of\
    \ multi-homed hosts and multicasting\n   routing services are encompassed by this\
    \ goal.  Datagram delivery is\n   to be provided to all interconnected systems\
    \ when not otherwise\n   constrained by autonomous considerations.\n"
- title: 2.2  Routing is Assured
  contents:
  - "2.2  Routing is Assured\n   Routing services are to be provided with assurance,\
    \ where the\n   inability to provide a service is communicated under best effort\
    \ to\n   the requester within an acceptable level of error.  This assurance is\n\
    \   not to be misconstrued to mean guaranteed datagram delivery nor does\n   it\
    \ imply error notification for every lost datagram.  Instead,\n   attempts to\
    \ utilize network routing services when such service cannot\n   be provided will\
    \ result in requester notification within a reasonable\n   period given persistent\
    \ attempts.\n"
- title: 2.3  Large System
  contents:
  - "2.3  Large System\n   The design of the architecture, and the protocols within\
    \ this\n   architecture, should accommodate a large number of routing entities.\n\
    \   The exact order of magnitude is a relative guess and the best designs\n  \
    \ would provide for a practical level of unbounded growth.\n   Nevertheless, the\
    \ routing architecture is expected to accommodate the\n   growth of the Internet\
    \ environment for the next 10 years.\n"
- title: 2.4  Autonomous Operation
  contents:
  - "2.4  Autonomous Operation\n   The routing architecture is to allow for stable\
    \ operation when\n   significant portions of the internetworking environment are\n\
    \   controlled by disjoint entities.  The future Internet environment is\n   envisioned\
    \ as consisting of a large number of internetworking\n   facilities owned and\
    \ operated by a variety of funding sources and\n   administrative concerns.  Although\
    \ cooperation between these\n   facilities is necessary to provide interconnectivity,\
    \ it is viewed\n   that both the degree and type of cooperation will vary widely.\n\
    \   Additionally, each of these internetworking facilities desires to\n   operate\
    \ as independently as possible from the concerns and activities\n   of other facilities\
    \ individually and the interconnection environment\n   as a whole.  Those resources\
    \ used by (and available for) routing are\n   to be allowed autonomous control\
    \ by those administrative entities\n   which own or operate them. Specifically,\
    \ each controlling\n   administration should be allowed to establish and maintain\
    \ policies\n   regarding the use of a given routing resource.\n"
- title: 2.5  Distributed System
  contents:
  - "2.5  Distributed System\n   The routing environment developed should not depend\
    \ upon a data\n   repository or topological entity which is either centralized\
    \ or\n   ubiquitous.  The growth pattern of the Internet, coupled with the\n \
    \  need for autonomous operation, dictates an independence from the\n   topological\
    \ and administrative centralization of both data and\n   control flows.  Past\
    \ experience with a centralized topology has shown\n   that it is both impractical\
    \ for the needs of the community and\n   restrictive of administrative freedoms.\
    \  A distributed routing\n   environment should not be restrictive of either redundancy\
    \ or\n   diversity.  Any new routing environment must allow for arbitrary\n  \
    \ interconnection between internetworks.\n"
- title: 2.6  Provide A Credible Environment
  contents:
  - "2.6  Provide A Credible Environment\n   The routing environment and services\
    \ should be based upon mechanisms\n   and information that exhibit both integrity\
    \ and security.  The\n   routing mechanisms should operate in a sound and reliable\
    \ fashion\n   while the routing information base should provide credible data\
    \ upon\n   which to base routing decisions.  The environment can be unreliable\n\
    \   to the extent that the resulting effect on routing services is\n   negligible.\
    \  The architecture and protocol designs should be such\n   that the routing environment\
    \ is reasonably secure from unwanted\n   modification or influence.\n"
- title: 2.7  Be A Managed Entity
  contents:
  - "2.7  Be A Managed Entity\n   Provide a manger insight into the operation of the\
    \ inter-autonomous\n   system routing environment to support resource management,\
    \ problem\n   solving, and fault isolation.  Allow for management control of the\n\
    \   routing system and collect useful information for the internetwork\n   management\
    \ environment.  Datagram events as well as the content and\n   distribution characteristics\
    \ of relevant databases are of particular\n   importance.\n"
- title: 2.8  Minimize Required Resources
  contents:
  - "2.8  Minimize Required Resources\n   Any feasible design should restrain the\
    \ demand for resources required\n   to provide inter-autonomous systems routing.\
    \  Of particular interest\n   are those resources required for data storage, transmission,\
    \ and\n   processing.  The design must be practical in terms of today's\n   technology.\
    \  Specifically, do not assume significant upgrades to the\n   existing level\
    \ of technology in use today for data communication\n   systems.\n"
- title: 3.  Functional Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  Functional Requirements\n   The functional requirements we have identified\
    \ have been derived from\n   the overall goals and describe the critical features\
    \ expected of\n   inter-autonomous system routing.  To an extent, these functions\
    \ are\n   vague in terms of detail.  We do not, for instance, specify the\n  \
    \ quantity or types for quality-of-service parameters.  This is\n   purposeful,\
    \ as the functional requirements specified here are\n   intended to define the\
    \ features required of the inter-autonomous\n   system routing environment rather\
    \ than the exact nature of this\n   environment.  The functional requirements\
    \ identified have been\n   loosely grouped according to areas of architectural\
    \ impact.\n"
- title: 3.1  Route Synthesis Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.1  Route Synthesis Requirements\n   Route synthesis is that functional area\
    \ concerned with both route\n   selection and path determination (identification\
    \ of a sequence of\n   intermediate systems) from a source to a destination. \
    \ The functional\n   requirements identified here provide for path determination\
    \ which is\n   adaptive to topology changes, responsive to administrative policy,\n\
    \   cognizant of quality-of-service concerns, and sensitive to an\n   interconnected\
    \ environment of autonomously managed systems.\n      a) Route around failures\
    \ dynamically\n         Route synthesis will provide a best effort attempt to\
    \ detect\n         failures in those routing resources which are currently being\n\
    \         utilized.  Upon detection of a failed resource, route synthesis\n  \
    \       will provide a best effort to utilize other available routing\n      \
    \   resources in an attempt to provide the necessary routing\n         service.\n\
    \      b) Provide loop free paths\n         The path provided for a datagram,\
    \ from source to destination,\n         will be free of circuits or loops most\
    \ of the time.  At those\n         times a circuit or loop exists, it occurs with\
    \ both negligible\n         probability and duration.\n      c) Know when a path\
    \ or destination is unavailable\n         Route synthesis will be capable of determining\
    \ when a path\n         cannot be constructed to reach a known destination.\n\
    \         Additionally, route synthesis will be capable of determining\n     \
    \    when a given destination cannot be determined because the\n         requested\
    \ destination is unknown (or this knowledge is\n         unavailable).\n     \
    \ d) Provide paths sensitive to administrative policies\n         Route synthesis\
    \ will accommodate the resource utilization\n         policies of those administrative\
    \ entities which manage the\n         resources identified by the resulting path.\
    \  However, it is\n         inconceivable to accommodate all policies which can\
    \ be defined\n         by a managing administrative entity.  Specifically, policies\n\
    \         dependent upon volatile events of great celerity or those which\n  \
    \       are non-deterministic in nature cannot be accommodated.\n      e) Provide\
    \ paths sensitive to user policies\n         Paths produced by route synthesis\
    \ must be sensitive to policies\n         expressed by the user.  These user policies\
    \ are expressed in\n         terms relevant to known characteristics of the topology.\
    \  The\n         path achieved will meet the requirements stated by the user\n\
    \         policy.\n      f) Provide paths which characterize user quality-of-service\n\
    \         requirements\n         The characteristics of the path provided should\
    \ match those\n         indicated by the quality-of-service requested.  When\n\
    \         appropriate, utilize only those resources which can support the\n  \
    \       desired quality-of-service (e.g., bandwidth).\n      g) Provide autonomy\
    \ between inter- and intra-autonomous system\n         route synthesis\n     \
    \    The inter- and intra-autonomous system routing environments\n         should\
    \ operate independent of one another.  The architecture\n         and design should\
    \ be such that route synthesis of either\n         routing environment does not\
    \ depend upon information from the\n         other for successful functioning.\
    \  Specifically, the inter-\n         autonomous system route synthesis design\
    \ should minimize the\n         constraints on the intra-autonomous system route\
    \ synthesis\n         decisions when transiting (or delivering to) the autonomous\n\
    \         system.\n"
- title: 3.2  Forwarding Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.2  Forwarding Requirements\n   The following requirements specifically address\
    \ the functionality of\n   the datagram forwarding process.  The forwarding process\
    \ transfers\n   datagrams to intermediate or final destinations based upon datagram\n\
    \   characteristics, environmental characteristics, and route synthesis\n   decisions.\n\
    \      a) Decouple inter- and intra-autonomous system forwarding\n         decisions\n\
    \         The requirement is to provide a degree of independence between\n   \
    \      the inter-autonomous system forwarding decision and the intra-\n      \
    \   autonomous system forwarding decision within the forwarding\n         process.\
    \  Though the forwarding decisions are to be independent\n         of each other,\
    \ the inter-autonomous system delivery process may\n         necessarily be dependent\
    \ upon intra-autonomous system route\n         synthesis and forwarding.\n   \
    \   b) Do not forward datagrams deemed administratively inappropriate\n      \
    \   Forward datagrams according to the route synthesis decision if\n         it\
    \ does not conflict with known policy.  Policy sensitive route\n         synthesis\
    \ will prevent normally routed datagrams from utilizing\n         inappropriate\
    \ resources.  However, a datagram routed abnormally\n         due to unknown events\
    \ or actions can always occur and the only\n         way to prohibit unwanted\
    \ traffic from entering or leaving an\n         autonomous system is to provide\
    \ policy enforcement within the\n         forwarding function.\n      c) Do not\
    \ forward datagrams to failed resources\n         A datagram is not to be forwarded\
    \ to a resource known to be\n         unavailable, notably an intermediate system\
    \ such as a gateway.\n         This implies some ability to detect and react to\
    \ resource\n         failures.\n      d) Forward datagram according to its characteristics\n\
    \         The datagram forwarding function is to be sensitive to the\n       \
    \  characteristics of the datagram in order to execute the\n         appropriate\
    \ route synthesis decision.  Characteristics to\n         consider are the destination,\
    \ quality-of-service, precedence,\n         datagram (or user) policy, and security.\
    \  Note that some\n         characteristics, precedence for example, affect the\
    \ forwarding\n         service provided whereas others affect the path chosen.\n"

    \ information requirements\n   of the routing environment.  This encompasses both\
    \ the nature and\n   disbursal of routing information.  The characteristics of\
    \ the routing\n   information and its disbursal are given by the following functional\n\
    \   requirements.\n      a) Provide a distributed and descriptive information\
    \ base\n         The information base must not depend upon either centralization\n\
    \         or exact replication.  The content of the information base must\n  \
    \       be sufficient to support all provided routing functionality,\n       \

    \ utilization policies.\n      b) Determine resource availability\n         Provide\
    \ a means of determining the availability of any utilized\n         resource in\
    \ a timely manner.  The timeliness of this\n         determination is dependent\

    \ utilization\n         The dynamics of routing information flow should be such\
    \ that a\n         significant portion of transmission resources are not consumed.\n\
    \         Routing information flow should adjust to the demands of the\n     \

- title: 4.  Non-Goals
  contents:
  - "4.  Non-Goals\n   In view of the conflicting nature of many of the stated goals\
    \ and the\n   careful considerations and tradeoffs necessary to achieve a\n  \
    \ successful design, it is important to also identify those goals or\n   functions\
    \ which we are not attempting to achieve.  The following\n   items are not considered\
    \ to be reasonable goals or functional\n   requirements at this time and are best\
    \ left to future efforts. These\n   are non-goals, or non-requirements, within\
    \ the context of the goals\n   and requirements previously stated by this document\
    \ as well as our\n   interpretation of what can be practically achieved.\n   \
    \   a) Ubiquity\n         It is not a goal to design a routing environment in\

    \ to\n         any other participating autonomous system in a ubiquitous\n   \
    \      fashion.  Within a policy sensitive routing environment, the\n        \
    \ cooperation of intermediate resources will be necessary and\n         cannot\
    \ be guaranteed to all participants.  The concept of\n         ubiquitous connectivity\
    \ will not be a valid one.\n      b) Congestion control\n         The ability\
    \ for inter-autonomous system routing to perform\n         congestion control\
    \ is a non-requirement.  Additional study is\n         necessary to determine\
    \ what mechanisms are most appropriate and\n         if congestion control is\
    \ best realized within the inter-AS\n         and/or intra-AS environments, and\
    \ if both, what the dynamics of\n         the interactions between the two are.\n\
    \      c) Load splitting\n         The functional capability to distribute the\
    \ flow of datagrams,\n         from a source to a destination, across two or more\
    \ distinct\n         paths through route synthesis and/or forwarding is a non-\n\
    \         requirement.\n      d) Maximizing the utilization of resources\n   \
    \      There is no goal or requirement for the inter-autonomous system\n     \
    \    routing environment to be designed such that it attempts to\n         maximize\
    \ the utilization of available resources.\n      e) Schedule to deadline service\n\

  - "A.1  Introduction\n   The information and discussion contained here historically\
    \ precedes\n   that of the main document body and was a major influence on its\n\
    \   content.  It is included here as a matter of reference and to provide\n  \
    \ insight into some of the many issues involved in inter-autonomous\n   systems\
    \ routing.\n   The following definitions are utilized:\n      Boundary Gateway\n\
    \            A boundary gateway is any autonomous system gateway which\n     \
    \       has a network interface directly reachable from another\n            autonomous\
    \ system.  As a member of an autonomous system, a\n            boundary gateway\
    \ participates in the Interior Gateway\n            Protocol and other protocols\
    \ used for routing (and other\n            purposes) between other gateways of\
    \ this same autonomous\n            system and between those networks directly\
    \ reachable by this\n            autonomous system.  A boundary gateway may also\n\
    \            participate in an Inter-Autonomous System Routing Protocol.\n   \
    \         As a participant in the inter-autonomous system routing\n          \
    \  protocol, a boundary gateway interacts with other boundary\n            gateways\
    \ in other autonomous systems, either directly or\n            indirectly, in\
    \ support of the operation of the\n            Inter-Autonomous System Routing\
    \ Protocol.\n      Interior Gateway\n            An interior gateway is any autonomous\
    \ system gateway which\n            is not a boundary gateway.  As such, an interior\
    \ gateway\n            does not have any network interfaces which are directly\n\
    \            reachable by any other autonomous system.  An interior\n        \
    \    gateway is part of an autonomous system and, as such,\n            takes\
    \ part in the Interior Gateway Protocol and other\n            protocols used\
    \ in that autonomous system. However, an\n            interior gateway does not\
    \ directly exchange routing\n            information with gateways in other autonomous\
    \ systems via\n            the Inter-Autonomous System Routing Protocol.\n   The\
    \ following acronyms are used:\n      AS -- Autonomous System\n            This\
    \ document uses the current definition of \"Autonomous\n            System\":\
    \ a collection of cooperating gateways running a\n            common interior\
    \ routing protocol. This implies that networks\n            and hosts may be reachable\
    \ through one or more Autonomous\n            Systems.\n            NOTE: The\
    \ current notion of \"Autonomous System\" implicitly\n            assumes that\
    \ each gateway will belong to exactly one AS.\n            Extensions to allow\
    \ gateways which belong to no AS's\n            and/or gateways which belong to\
    \ multiple AS's, are beyond\n            the scope of this discussion. However,\
    \ we do not preclude\n            the possibility of considering such extensions\
    \ in the\n            future.\n      IARP -- Inter-Autonomous System Routing Protocol\n\
    \            This is the protocol used between boundary gateways for\n       \
    \     the purpose of routing between autonomous systems.\n      IGP -- Interior\
    \ Gateway Protocol\n            This is the protocol used within an autonomous\
    \ system for\n            routing within that autonomous system.\n"

  - "A.2  Architectural Issues\n   The architecture of an inter-autonomous system\
    \ routing environment is\n   mutually dependent with the notion of an Autonomous\
    \ System. In\n   general, the architecture should maximize independence of the\n\
    \   internals of an AS from the internals of other AS's, as well as from\n   the\
    \ inter-autonomous system routing protocols (IARP). This\n   independence should\
    \ allow technological and administrative\n   differences among AS's as well as\
    \ protection against propagation of\n   misbehavior.  The following issues address\
    \ ways to achieve\n   interoperation and protection, and to meet certain performance\n\
    \   criteria. We also put forth a set of minimal constraints to be\n   imposed\
    \ among Autonomous Systems, and between inter- and intra-AS\n   functions.\n"

  - "A.2.1  IGP Behavior\n   The IARP should be capable of tolerating an Autonomous\
    \ System in\n   which its IGP is unable to route packets, provides incorrect\n\
    \   information, and exhibits unstable behavior.  Interfacing to such an\n   ill-behaved\
    \ AS should not produce global instabilities within the\n   IARP and the IARP\
    \ should localize any effects.  On the other hand,\n   the IGP should provide\
    \ a routing environment where the information\n   and connectivity provided to\
    \ the IARP from the IGP does not exhibit\n   rapid and continual changes.  An\
    \ Autonomous System therefore should\n   appear as a relatively stable environment.\n"

  - "A.2.3  General Topology\n   The routing architecture should provide significant\
    \ flexibility\n   regarding the interconnection of AS's.  The specification of\

    \ be administrative and policy limitations on the interconnection\n   of AS's,\

- title: A.2.4  Routing Firewalls
  contents:
  - "A.2.4  Routing Firewalls\n   We expect AS's to have a certain amount of insulation\
    \ from other\n   AS's.  This protection should apply to both the adequacy and\n\
    \   stability of routes produced by the routing scheme, and also to the\n   amount\
    \ of overhead traffic and other costs necessary to run the\n   routing scheme.\
    \  There are several forms which these \"routing\n   firewalls\" may take:\n \
    \     -  An AS must be able to successfully route its own internal\n         traffic\
    \ in the face of arbitrary failures of other IGPs and the\n         IARP.  In\
    \ other words, the AS should be able to effectively\n         shutout the rest\
    \ of the world.\n      -  The IARP should be able to operate correctly in the\
    \ face of IGP\n         failures.  In this case, correct operation is defined\
    \ as\n         recognizing that an AS has failed, and routing around it if\n \
    \        possible (traffic to or from that AS may of course fail).\n      -  In\
    \ addition, problems in Inter-AS Routing should, as much as\n         possible,\
    \ be limited in the extent of their effect.\n   Routing firewalls may be explicit,\
    \ or may be inherent in the design\n   of the algorithms.  We expect that both\
    \ explicit and inherent\n   firewalls will be utilized.  Examples of firewalls\
    \ include:\n      -  Separating Intra- and Inter-AS Routing to some extent\n \
    \        isolates each of these from problems with the other.  Clearly\n     \
    \    defined interfaces between different modules/protocols provides\n       \
    \  some degree of protection.\n      -  Access control restrictions may provide\
    \ some degree of\n         firewalls.  For example, some AS's may be non-transit\
    \ (won't\n         forward transit traffic).  Failures within such AS's may be\n\
    \         prevented from affecting traffic not associated with that AS.\n    \
    \  -  Protocol design can help.  For example, with link state routing\n      \
    \   you can require that both ends must report a link before is may\n        \
    \ be regarded as up, thereby eliminating the possibility of a\n         single\
    \ node causing fictitious links.\n      -  Finally, explicit firewalls may be\
    \ employed using explicit\n         configuration information.\n"

- title: A.2.6.1  Internal Links between Boundary Gateways
  contents:
  - "A.2.6.1  Internal Links between Boundary Gateways\n   In those cases where an\
    \ AS may act as a transit AS (i.e., may pass\n   traffic for which neither the\
    \ source nor the destination is in that\n   AS), the gateways internal to that\
    \ AS will need to know which\n   boundary gateway is to serve as the exit gateway\
    \ from that AS. There\n   are several ways in which this may be accomplished:\n\
    \      1. Boundary gateways are directly connected\n      2. \"Tunneling\" (i)\
    \ using source routing (ii) using encapsulation\n      3. Interior gateways participate\
    \ (i) limited participation (ii)\n         fully general participation\n   With\
    \ solution (1), the boundary gateways in an AS are directly\n   connected.  This\
    \ eliminates the need for other gateways in the AS to\n   have any knowledge of\
    \ Inter-AS Routing.  Transit traffic is passed\n   directly among the boundary\
    \ gateways of the AS.\n   With solution (2), transit traffic may traverse interior\
    \ gateways,\n   but these interior gateways are protected from any need to have\n\
    \   knowledge about Inter-AS routes by means such as source routing or\n   encapsulation.\
    \  The boundary gateway by which the packet enters an AS\n   determines the boundary\
    \ gateway which will serve as the exit gateway.\n   This may require that the\
    \ entrance boundary gateway add a source\n   route to the packet, or encapsulate\
    \ the packet in another level of IP\n   or gateway-to-gateway header.  This allows\
    \ boundary gateways to\n   forward data traffic using the appropriate tunnelling\
    \ technique.\n   Finally, with solution (3), the interior gateways have some knowledge\n\
    \   of Inter-AS Routing.  At a minimum, the interior gateways would need\n   to\
    \ know the identity of each boundary gateway, the address(es) that\n   can be\
    \ reached by that gateway, and the Inter-AS metric associated\n   with the route\
    \ to that address(es).  If the IARP allows for separate\n   routing for multiple\
    \ TOS classes, then the information that the\n   interior gateways need to know\
    \ includes a separate Inter-AS metric\n   for each TOS class.  The Inter-AS metrics\
    \ are necessary to allow\n   gateways to choose among multiple possible exit boundary\
    \ gateways.\n   In general, it is not necessary for the Inter-AS metrics to have\
    \ any\n   relationship with the metric used within an AS for interior routing.\n\
    \   The interior gateways do not need to know how to interpret the\n   exterior\
    \ metrics, except to know that each metric is to be\n   interpreted as an unsigned\
    \ integer and a lesser value is preferable\n   to a greater value.  It would be\
    \ possible, but not necessary, for the\n   interior gateways to have full knowledge\
    \ of the IARP.\n   It is not necessary for the Inter-AS Routing architecture to\
    \ specify\n   which of these solutions are to be used for any particular AS.\n\
    \   Rather, it is possible for individual AS's to choose which scheme or\n   combination\
    \ of schemes to use.  Independence of the IARP from the\n   internal operation\
    \ of each AS implies that this decision be left up\n   to the internal protocols\
    \ used in each AS.  The IARP must be able to\n   operate as if the boundary gateways\
    \ were directly connected.\n"

  contents:
  - "A.2.6.2  Forwarding of Data from the AS\n   The scheme used for forwarding transit\

    \ other AS's.  If\n   either of solutions (1) or (2) in Section A.2.6.1 is followed,\

    \   to any boundary gateway.  Greater efficiency may optionally be\n   achieved\
    \ in some cases by providing interior gateways with additional\n   information\
    \ which will allow them to choose the \"best\" boundary\n   gateway in some sense.\
    \  If solution (3) is followed, then the\n   information passed to interior gateways\

    \ data packet which is allowed access to the AS, the AS is expected\n   to deliver\

- title: A.3  Policy Issues
  contents:
  - "A.3  Policy Issues\n   The interconnection of multiple heterogeneous networks\
    \ and multiple\n   heterogeneous autonomous systems owned and operated by multiple\n\
    \   administrations into a single combined internet is a very complex\n   task.\
    \  It is expected that the administrations associated with such\n   an internet\
    \ will wish to impose a variety of constraints on the\n   operation of the internet.\
    \  Specifically, externally imposed routing\n   constraints may include a variety\
    \ of transit access control,\n   administrative policy, and security constraints.\n\
    \   Transit access control refers to those access control restrictions\n   which\
    \ an AS may impose to restrict which traffic the AS is willing to\n   forward.\
    \  There are a large number of access control restrictions\n   which one could\
    \ envision being used.  For example, some AS's may wish\n   to operate only as\
    \ \"non-transit\" AS's, that is, they will only\n   forward data traffic which\
    \ either originates or terminates within\n   that AS.  Other AS's may restrict\
    \ transit traffic to datagrams which\n   originate within a specified set of source\
    \ hosts. Restrictions may\n   require that datagrams be associated with specific\
    \ applications (such\n   as electronic mail traffic only), or that datagrams be\
    \ associated\n   with specific classes of users.\n   Policy restrictions may allow\
    \ either the source of datagrams, or the\n   organization that is paying for transmission\
    \ of a datagram, to limit\n   which AS's the datagrams may transit.  For example,\
    \ an organization\n   may wish to specify that certain traffic originating within\
    \ their AS\n   should not transit any AS administered by its main competitor.\n\
    \   Security restrictions on traffic relates to the official security\n   classification\
    \ level of traffic.  As an example, an AS may specify\n   that all classified\
    \ traffic is not allowed to leave its AS.\n   The main problem with producing\
    \ a routing scheme which is sensitive\n   to transit access control, administrative\
    \ policy, and security\n   constraints is the associated potential for exponential\
    \ growth of\n   routes.  For example, suppose that there are 20 packets arriving\
    \ at a\n   particular gateway, each for the same destination, but subject to a\n\
    \   different combination of access control, policy, and security\n   constraints.\
    \  It is possible that all 20 packets would need to follow\n   different routes\
    \ to the destination.\n   This explosive growth of routes leads to the question:\
    \ \"Is it\n   practically feasible to deal with complete general external routing\n\
    \   constraints?\" One approach would allow only a smaller subset of\n   constraints,\
    \ chosen to provide some useful level of control while\n   allowing minimal impact\
    \ on the routing protocol.  Further work is\n   needed to determine the feasibility\
    \ of this approach.\n   There is another problem with dealing with transit access\
    \ control,\n   policy, and security restrictions in a fully general way.\n   Specifically,\
    \ it is not clear just what the total set of possible\n   restrictions should\
    \ be.  Efforts to study this issue are currently\n   underway, but are not expected\
    \ to produce definitive results within a\n   short to medium time frame.  It is\
    \ therefore not practical to wait\n   for this effort to be finished before defining\
    \ the next generation of\n   Inter-AS Routing.\n"

- title: A.4.1  Cost on Toll Networks
  contents:
  - "A.4.1  Cost on Toll Networks\n   Consideration must be given to the use of routing\
    \ protocols with toll\n   (i.e., charge) networks.  Although uncommon in the Internet\
    \ at the\n   moment, they will become more common in the future, and thought needs\n\
    \   to be given to allowing their inclusion in an efficient and effective\n  \
    \ manner.\n   There are two areas in which concerns of cost intrude.  First,\n\
    \   provision must be made to include in the routing information\n   distributed\
    \ throughout the system the information that certain links\n   cost money, so\
    \ that traffic patterns may account for the cost.\n   Second, the actual operation\
    \ of the algorithm, in terms of the\n   messages that must be exchanged to operate\
    \ the algorithm, must\n   recognize that fact that on certain links, the exchange\
    \ may have an\n   associated cost which must be taken into account.  These areas\
    \ often\n   involve policy questions on the part of the user.  It is a\n   requirement\
    \ of the algorithm that facilities be available to allow\n   different groups\
    \ to answer these questions in different ways.  The\n   first area is related\
    \ to type-of-service routing, and is discussed in\n   Section A.4.2.  The second\
    \ area is discussed below.\n   Previous attempts at providing these sorts of controls\
    \ were\n   incomplete because they were not thought through fully; a new effort\n\
    \   must avoid these pitfalls.  For instance, even though the Hello rate\n   in\
    \ EGP may be adjusted, turning the rate down too low (to control the\n   costs)\
    \ could cause the route to be dropped from databases through\n   timeout.\n  \
    \ In a large internet, changes will be occurring constantly; a\n   simplistic\
    \ mechanism might mean that a site which is only connected\n   by toll networks\
    \ has to either accept having an old picture of the\n   network, or spend more\
    \ to keep a more current picture of things.\n   However, that is not necessarily\
    \ the case if incomplete knowledge and\n   cache-based techniques are used more.\
    \ For instance, if a site\n   connected only by toll links keeps an incomplete\
    \ or less up-to-date\n   map of the situation, an agreement with a neighbor which\
    \ does not\n   labor under these restrictions might allow it to get up-to-date\n\

    \ it is\n   mandatory that it be built with mechanisms to provide TOS routing.\n\
    \   Unfortunately, we have had very little experience with TOS routing,\n   even\
    \ with a single network.  No TOS routing system has ever been\n   field-tested\
    \ on a large-scale basis.\n   We foresee the need for TOS routing and recognize\
    \ the possible\n   complexities and difficulties in design and implementation.\
    \  We also\n   consider that new applications coming along may require novel\n\
    \   services that are unforeseeable today.  We feel a practical approach\n   is\
    \ to provide a small set of TOS routing functions as a first step\n   while the\
    \ design of the architecture should be such that new classes\n   of TOS can be\
    \ easily added later and incrementally deployed.  The\n   Inter-AS Routing Architecture\
    \ should allow both globally and locally\n   defined TOS classes.\n   We intend\
    \ to address TOS routing based on the following metrics:\n      -  Delay\n   \
    \   -  Throughput\n      -  Cost\n   Delay and throughput are the main network\
    \ performance concerns.\n   Considering that some networks may soon start charging\
    \ users for the\n   transmission services provided, the cost should also be added\
    \ as a\n   factor in route selection.\n   Reliability is not included in the above\
    \ list.  Different\n   applications with different reliability requirements will\
    \ differ in\n   terms of what Transport Protocol they use.  However, IP offers\
    \ only a\n   \"moderate\" level of reliability, suitable to applications such\
    \ as\n   voice, or possibly even less than that required by voice. The level\n\
    \   of reliability offered by IP will not differ substantially based on\n   the\
    \ application.  Thus the requested level of reliability will not\n   affect Inter-AS\
    \ Routing.\n   Delay and throughput will be measured from the physical\n   characteristics\
    \ of communication channels, without considering\n   instantaneous load.  This\
    \ is necessary in order to provide stable\n   routes, and to minimize the overhead\
    \ caused by the Inter-AS Routing\n   scheme.\n   A number of TOS service classes\
    \ may be defined according to these\n   metrics.  Each class will present defined\
    \ requirements for each of\n   the TOS metrics.  For example, one class may require\
    \ low delay,\n   require only low throughput, and require low cost.\n"

    \ respond in a timely\n   fashion to major network problems, such as the failure\
    \ of specific\n   network resources.  In this sense, Inter-AS Routing needs to\
    \ use\n   adaptive routing mechanisms similar to those commonly used within\n\
    \   individual networks and AS's.  It is important that the adaptive\n   routing\
    \ mechanism chosen for Inter-AS Routing achieve rapid\n   convergence following\
    \ internet topological changes, with little or\n   none of the serious convergence\
    \ problems (such as \"counting to\n   infinity\") that have been experienced in\

- title: A.5.2  Large Internets
  contents:
  - "A.5.2  Large Internets\n   One key question in terms of the targets is the maximum\
    \ size of the\n   Internet this algorithm is supposed to support.  To some degree,\
    \ this\n   is tied to the timeline for which this protocol is expected to be\n\
    \   active.  However, it is necessary to have some size targets.\n   Techniques\
    \ that work at one order of size may be impractical in a\n   system ten or twenty\
    \ times larger.\n   Over the past five years there has been an approximate doubling\
    \ of\n   the Internet each year.  In January 1988, there were more than 330\n\
    \   operational networks and more than 700 network assigned numbers.\n   Exact\
    \ figures for the future growth rate of the Internet are\n   difficult to predict\
    \ accurately.  However, if this doubling trend\n   continues, we would reach 10,000\
    \ nets sometime near January 1993.\n   Taking a projection purely on the number\
    \ of networks (the top level\n   routing entity) may be overly conservative since\
    \ the introduction and\n   wide use of subnets has absorbed some growth, but will\
    \ not continue\n   to be able to do so.  In addition, there are plans being discussed\n\
    \   that will continue or accelerate the current rate of growth.\n   Nonetheless,\
    \ the number of networks is very important because\n   networks constitute the\
    \ \"top level entities\" in the current\n   addressing structure.\n   The implications\
    \ of the size parameter are fairly serious.  The\n   current system has only one\
    \ level of addressing above subnets. While\n   it is possible to adjust certain\
    \ parameters (for example, the\n   unsolicited or unnecessary retransmission rate)\
    \ to produce a larger\n   but less robust system, other parameters (for example,\
    \ the rate of\n   change in the system) cannot be so adjusted.  This will provide\n\
    \   eventual limits on the size of a system that can be dealt with in a\n   flat\
    \ address space.\n   The exact size that necessitates moving from the current\
    \ single-\n   level system to a multi-level system is not clear.  Among the\n\
    \   parameters which affect it are the assumed minimum speed of links in\n   the\
    \ system (faster links can allocate more bandwidth to routing\n   traffic before\
    \ it becomes obtrusive), speed and memory capacity of\n   routing nodes (needed\
    \ to store and process routing data), rate at\n   which topology changes, etc.\
    \  The maximum size which can be handled\n   in a single layer is generally thought\
    \ to be somewhere on the order\n   of 10 thousand objects.  The IARP must be designed\
    \ to deal with\n   internets bigger than this.\n"

    \ any new\n   IARP be able to use a new addressing format which allows for\n \
    \  addressing hierarchies beyond the network level.  Any new IARP should\n   allow\
    \ for graceful migration from the current routing protocols, and\n   should also\

    \ routing\n   information and of forwarding packets.  These significant factors\n\
    \   should provide the basis for comparison between competing proposals\n   in\

    \ of the\n   Internet, the expected memory capacity of the gateways, capacity\
    \ of\n   the Inter-AS links, and the computing speed of the gateways. Given\n\
    \   our experience with the current Internet, it is clearly necessary for\n  \
    \ the scheme to function adequately even if the Internet grows more\n   quickly\
    \ than we predict and its capacity grows more slowly.  Memory,\n   CPU, and bandwidth\

    \   in a fully correct and up-to-date form.  Problems in configuration\n   have\
    \ been known to cause significant problems in existing operational\n   networks\
    \ and internets.  The design of an Inter-AS Routing\n   architecture must therefore\
    \ simplify the maintenance of configuration\n   information, consistent with other\
    \ requirements. Simplification of\n   configuration information may require minimizing\

    \ by one\n   party as long as that utilization does not disrupt the current or\n\
