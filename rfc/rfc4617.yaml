  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IVIS uses and produces many kinds of information resources\
    \ such\n   as E-services, E-service instances, specifications, standards,\n  \
    \ working documents, and XML schemas.  An ID in IVIS has to be unique\n   for\
    \ global use every time.\n"

    \      IVIS ancillary documentation is under development.\n   Identifier uniqueness\
    \ considerations:\n      Uniqueness is guaranteed by the IVIS that issues the\
    \ numbers.  The\n      numbers are not reassigned.\n   Identifier persistence\
    \ considerations:\n      Persistence of identifiers is dependent upon the persistence\
    \ of\n      the system name assignment by system name holders.\n   Process of\
    \ identifier assignment:\n      All the assignments of identifiers are fully controlled\
    \ and\n      managed by the IVIS and its subsystems.\n   Process of identifier\
    \ resolution:\n      The holders of system names are responsible for operating\
    \ or\n      delegating resolution servers for the system in which they have\n\
    \      assigned URNs.\n   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n      The entire URN\
    \ is case insensitive.\n   Conformity with URN syntax:\n      IVIS schema URN\
    \ fully conforms to [RFC2141] syntax, except that\n      symbols \"'\" and \"\
    :\" were excluded from <other>.\n   Validation mechanism:\n      <IVIS Org ID>\
    \ could be validated by using a special IVIS database\n      service. <ResID -\
    \ suffix> could be validated by an appropriate\n      subsystem.\n   Scope:\n\
    \      Global.\n"

- title: 4.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Community Considerations\n   Every Latvian ministry's local authority produces\
    \ many kinds of\n   different documents, offers public services.  Each of the\
    \ information\n   resources is already uniquely identified within an authority-\n\
    \   producer.  The IVIS URN namespace helps unify information resource\n   identifiers\
    \ by using existent Latvian government authority\n   identification procedures\
    \ to produce E-services and different\n   documents where many parties are involved.\
    \  Any citizen or\n   organization with Internet web browser capability will be\
    \ entitled to\n   access the namespace and its associated application, registration,\n\
    \   and resolution services.  The primary IVIS namespace usage is to\n   identify\
    \ information resources, such as XML messages, their schemas,\n   and other resources,\
    \ which can be public or have a special\n   destination, when a few different\
    \ parties are involved in the\n   interchange.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   This document includes a RUN Network Identifier (NID)\
    \ registration\n   for IVIS for entry in the IANA registry of URN NIDs (see [RFC2434]\n\
    \   for more information).\n"
- title: 6.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Namespace Considerations\n   To select necessary identifier schema, we spend\
    \ a lot time and\n   decided on URN, because an IVIS URN namespace has to resolve\
    \ the\n   following problems:\n   - Information resource uniqueness\n      Uniqueness\
    \ makes it possible to find a necessary resource and call\n      it anytime. \
    \ Uniqueness gives stability in message sending and\n      storing operations.\n\
    \   - Namespace understandability\n      IVIS URN consists of parts, which can\
    \ guarantee namespace\n      legibility.\n   - Information resource resolution\n\
    \      One of the IVIS namespace parts identifies the place where the\n      resource\
    \ can be found (resolved).\n      Therefore, a new URN assignment is required,\
    \ and individual URNs\n      shall be assigned through the process of development\
    \ of each XML\n      schema.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n      There are no additional security considerations\
    \ besides those\n      normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs\
    \ in\n      general.\n"
