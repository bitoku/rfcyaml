- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The OSI Directory uses distinguished names as the primary keys to\n\
    \   entries in the directory.  Distinguished Names are encoded in ASN.1.\n   When\
    \ a distinguished name is communicated between to users not using\n   a directory\
    \ protocol (e.g., in a mail message), there is a need to\n   have a user-oriented\
    \ string representation of distinguished name.\n   This specification defines\
    \ a string format for representing names,\n   which is designed to give a clean\
    \ representation of commonly used\n   names, whilst being able to represent any\
    \ distinguished name.\n"

- title: 1.  Why a notation is needed
  contents:
  - "1.  Why a notation is needed\n   Many OSI Applications make use of Distinguished\
    \ Names (DN) as defined\n   in the OSI Directory, commonly known as X.500 [1].\
    \  This\n   specification assumes familiarity with X.500, and the concept of\n\
    \   Distinguished Name.  It is important to have a common format to be\n   able\
    \ to unambiguously represent a distinguished name.  This might be\n   done to\
    \ represent a directory name on a business card or in an email\n   message.  There\
    \ is a need for a format to support human to human\n   communication, which must\
    \ be string based (not ASN.1) and user\n   oriented.  This notation is targeted\
    \ towards a general user oriented\n   system, and in particular to represent the\
    \ names of humans.  Other\n   syntaxes may be more appropriate for other uses\
    \ of the directory.\n   For example, the OSF Syntax may be more appropriate for\
    \ some system\n   oriented uses.  (The OSF Syntax uses \"/\" as a separator, and\
    \ forms\n   names in a manner intended to resemble UNIX filenames).\n"

- title: 2.1  Goals
  contents:
  - "2.1  Goals\n   The following goals are laid out:\n    o  To provide an unambiguous\
    \ representation of a distinguished name\n    o  To be an intuitive format for\
    \ the majority of names\n    o  To be fully general, and able to represent any\
    \ distinguished name\n    o  To be amenable to a number of different layouts to\
    \ achieve an\n       attractive representation.\n    o  To give a clear representation\
    \ of the contents of the\n       distinguished name\n"
- title: 2.2  Informal definition
  contents:
  - "2.2  Informal definition\n   This notation is designed to be convenient for common\
    \ forms of name.\n   Some examples are given.  The author's directory distinguished\
    \ name\n   would be written:\n   CN=Steve Kille,\n   O=ISODE Consortium, C=GB\n\
    \   This may be folded, perhaps to display in multi-column format.  For\n   example:\n\
    \   CN=Steve Kille,\n   O=ISODE Consortium,\n   C=GB\n   Another name might be:\n\
    \   CN=Christian Huitema, O=INRIA, C=FR\n   Semicolon (\";\") may be used as an\
    \ alternate separator.  The\n   separators may be mixed, but this usage is discouraged.\n\
    \   CN=Christian Huitema; O=INRIA; C=FR\n   In running text, this would be written\
    \ as <CN=Christian Huitema;\n   O=INRIA; C=FR>.  Another example, shows how different\
    \ attribute types\n   are handled:\n   CN=James Hacker,\n   L=Basingstoke,\n \
    \  O=Widget Inc,\n   C=GB\n   Here is an example of a multi-valued Relative Distinguished\
    \ Name,\n   where the namespace is flat within an organisation, and department\
    \ is\n   used to disambiguate certain names:\n   OU=Sales + CN=J. Smith, O=Widget\
    \ Inc., C=US\n   The final examples show both methods quoting of a comma in an\n\
    \   Organisation name:\n   CN=L. Eagle, O=\"Sue, Grabbit and Runn\", C=GB\n  \
    \ CN=L. Eagle, O=Sue\\, Grabbit and Runn, C=GB\n"
- title: 2.3  Formal definition
  contents:
  - "2.3  Formal definition\n   A formal definition can now be given.  The structure\
    \ is specified in\n   a BNF grammar in Figure 1.  This BNF uses the grammar defined\
    \ in RFC\n   822, with the terminals enclosed in <> [2].  This definition is in\
    \ an\n   abstract character set, and so may be written in any character set\n\
    \   supporting the explicitly defined special characters.  The quoting\n   mechanism\
    \ is used for the following cases:\n    o  Strings containing \",\", \"+\", \"\
    =\" or \"\"\" , <CR>, \"<\",\n       \">\", \"#\", or \";\".\n    o  Strings with\
    \ leading or trailing spaces\n    o  Strings containing consecutive spaces\n \
    \  There is an escape mechanism from the normal user oriented form, so\n   that\
    \ this syntax may be used to print any valid distinguished name.\n   This is ugly.\
    \  It is expected to be used only in pathological cases.\n   There are two parts\
    \ to this mechanism:\n   1.  Attributes types are represented in a (big-endian)\
    \ dotted\n       notation.  (e.g., OID.2.6.53).\n   2.  Attribute values are represented\
    \ in hexadecimal (e.g.  #0A56CF).\n       Each pair of hex digits defines an octet,\
    \ which is the ASN.1 Basic\n       Encoding Rules value of the Attribute Value.\n\
    \   The keyword specification is optional in the BNF, but mandatory for\n   this\
    \ specification.  This is so that the same BNF may be used for the\n   related\
    \ specification on User Friendly Naming [5].  When this\n   specification is followed,\
    \ the attribute type keywords must always be\n   present.\n   A list of valid\
    \ keywords for well known attribute types used in\n   naming is given in Table\
    \ 1.  Keywords may contain spaces, but shall\n   not have leading or trailing\
    \ spaces.  This is a list of keywords\n   which must be supported.  These are\
    \ chosen because they appear in\n   common forms of name, and can do so in a place\
    \ which does not\n   correspond to the default schema used.  A register of valid\
    \ keywords\n   is maintained by the IANA.\n   <name> ::= <name-component> ( <spaced-separator>\
    \ )\n          | <name-component> <spaced-separator> <name>\n   <spaced-separator>\

    \ are considered, but other attribute\n   syntaxes could be supported locally\
    \ (e.g., by use of the syntexes\n   defined in [3].)  It is assumed that the interface\
    \ will translate\n   from the supplied string into an appropriate Directory String\n\
    \   encoding.  The \"+\" notation is used to specify multi-component RDNs.\n \
    \  In this case, the types for attributes in the RDN must be explicit.\n   The\
    \ name is presented/input in a little-endian order (most\n   significant component\
    \ last).  When an address is written in a context\n   where there is a need to\
    \ delimit the entire address (e.g., in free\n   text), it is recommended that\
    \ the delimiters <> are used.  The\n   terminator > is a special in the notation\
    \ to facilitate this\n   delimitation.\n"
