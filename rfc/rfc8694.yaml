- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Computing paths across large multi-domain environments may\
    \ require\n   special computational components and cooperation between entities\
    \ in\n   different domains capable of complex path computation.\n   Issues that\
    \ may exist when routing in multi-domain networks include\n   the following:\n\
    \   *  There is often a lack of full topology and TE information across\n    \
    \  domains.\n   *  No single node has the full visibility to determine an optimal\
    \ or\n      even feasible end-to-end path across domains.\n   *  Knowing how to\
    \ evaluate and select the exit point and next domain\n      boundary from a domain.\n\
    \   *  Understanding how the ingress node determines which domains should\n  \
    \    be used for the end-to-end path.\n   An information exchange across multiple\
    \ domains is often limited due\n   to the lack of trust relationship, security\
    \ issues, or scalability\n   issues, even if there is a trust relationship between\
    \ domains.\n   The Path Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655] provides an architecture\n\
    \   and a set of functional components to address the problem space and\n   the\
    \ issues highlighted above.\n   A PCE may be used to compute end-to-end paths\
    \ across multi-domain\n   environments using a per-domain path computation technique\
    \ [RFC5152].\n   The so-called backward recursive PCE-based computation (BRPC)\n\
    \   mechanism [RFC5441] defines a path computation procedure to compute\n   inter-domain\
    \ constrained Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and\n   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)\
    \ Traffic-Engineered (TE) networks.  However,\n   both per-domain and BRPC techniques\
    \ assume that the sequence of\n   domains to be crossed from source to destination\
    \ is known, either\n   fixed by the network operator or obtained by other means.\n\
    \   In more advanced deployments (including multi-area and multi-\n   Autonomous\
    \ System (multi-AS) environments), the sequence of domains\n   may not be known\
    \ in advance, and the choice of domains in the end-to-\n   end domain sequence\
    \ might be critical to the determination of an\n   optimal end-to-end path.  In\
    \ this case, the use of the hierarchical\n   PCE [RFC6805] architecture and mechanisms\
    \ may be used to discover the\n   intra-area path and select the optimal end-to-end\
    \ domain sequence.\n   This document describes the processes and procedures available\
    \ when\n   using the PCE architecture and protocols for computing inter-area and\n\
    \   inter-AS MPLS and GMPLS Traffic-Engineered paths.\n   The scope of this document\
    \ does not include discussions of deployment\n   scenarios for stateful PCE, active\
    \ PCE, remotely initiated PCE, or\n   PCE as a central controller (PCECC).\n"
- title: 1.1.  Domains
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Domains\n   Generally, a domain can be defined as a separate administrative,\n\
    \   geographic, or switching environment within the network.  A domain\n   may\
    \ be further defined as a zone of routing or computational ability.\n   Under\
    \ these definitions, a domain might be categorized as an\n   Autonomous System\
    \ (AS) or an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) area (as\n   per [RFC4726] and [RFC4655]).\n\
    \   For the purposes of this document, a domain is considered to be a\n   collection\
    \ of network elements within an area or AS that has a common\n   sphere of address\
    \ management or path computational responsibility.\n   Wholly or partially overlapping\
    \ domains are not within the scope of\n   this document.\n   In the context of\
    \ GMPLS, a particularly important example of a domain\n   is the Automatically\
    \ Switched Optical Network (ASON) subnetwork\n   [G-8080].  In this case, computation\
    \ of an end-to-end path requires\n   the selection of nodes and links within a\
    \ parent domain where some\n   nodes may, in fact, be subnetworks.  Furthermore,\
    \ a domain might be\n   an ASON routing area [G-7715].  A PCE may perform the\
    \ path\n   computation function of an ASON Routing Controller as described in\n\
    \   [G-7715-2].\n   It is assumed that the PCE architecture is not applied to\
    \ a large\n   group of domains, such as the Internet.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Path Computation
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Path Computation\n   For the purpose of this document, it is assumed that\
    \ path computation\n   is the sole responsibility of the PCE as per the architecture\
    \ defined\n   in [RFC4655].  When a path is required, the Path Computation Client\n\
    \   (PCC) will send a request to the PCE.  The PCE will apply the\n   required\
    \ constraints, compute a path, and return a response to the\n   PCC.  In the context\
    \ of this document, it may be necessary for the\n   PCE to cooperate with other\
    \ PCEs in adjacent domains (as per BRPC\n   [RFC5441]) or with a parent PCE (as\
    \ per [RFC6805]).\n   It is entirely feasible that an operator could compute a\
    \ path across\n   multiple domains without the use of a PCE if the relevant domain\n\
    \   information is available to the network planner or network management\n  \
    \ platform.  The definition of what relevant information is required to\n   perform\
    \ this network planning operation and how that information is\n   discovered and\
    \ applied is outside the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 1.2.1.  PCE-Based Path Computation Procedure
  contents:
  - "1.2.1.  PCE-Based Path Computation Procedure\n   As highlighted, the PCE is an\
    \ entity capable of computing an inter-\n   domain TE path upon receiving a request\
    \ from a PCC.  There could be a\n   single PCE per domain or a single PCE responsible\
    \ for all domains.  A\n   PCE may or may not reside on the same node as the requesting\
    \ PCC.  A\n   path may be computed by either a single PCE node or a set of\n \
    \  distributed PCE nodes that collaborate during path computation.\n   According\
    \ to [RFC4655], a PCC should send a path computation request\n   to a particular\
    \ PCE using [RFC5440] (PCC-to-PCE communication).  This\n   negates the need to\
    \ broadcast a request to all the PCEs.  Each PCC\n   can maintain information\
    \ about the computation capabilities of the\n   PCEs it is aware of.  The PCC-PCE\
    \ capability awareness can be\n   configured using static configurations or by\
    \ automatic and dynamic\n   PCE discovery procedures.\n   If a network path is\
    \ required, the PCC will send a path computation\n   request to the PCE.  A PCE\
    \ may then compute the end-to-end path if it\n   is aware of the topology and\
    \ TE information required to compute the\n   entire path.  If the PCE is unable\
    \ to compute the entire path, the\n   PCE architecture provides cooperative PCE\
    \ mechanisms for the\n   resolution of path computation requests when an individual\
    \ PCE does\n   not have sufficient TE visibility.\n   End-to-end path segments\
    \ may be kept confidential through the\n   application of Path-Keys to protect\
    \ partial or full path information.\n   A Path-Key is a token that replaces a\
    \ path segment in an explicit\n   route.  The Path-Key mechanism is described\
    \ in [RFC5520].\n"
- title: 1.3.  Traffic Engineering Aggregation and Abstraction
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Traffic Engineering Aggregation and Abstraction\n   Networks are often\
    \ constructed from multiple areas or ASes that are\n   interconnected via multiple\
    \ interconnect points.  To maintain network\n   confidentiality and scalability,\
    \ the TE properties of each area and\n   AS are not generally advertised outside\
    \ each specific area or AS.\n   TE aggregation or abstraction provide a mechanism\
    \ to hide information\n   but may cause failed path setups or the selection of\
    \ suboptimal end-\n   to-end paths [RFC4726].  The aggregation process may also\
    \ have\n   significant scaling issues for networks with many possible routes and\n\
    \   multiple TE metrics.  Flooding TE information breaks confidentiality\n   and\
    \ does not scale in the routing protocol.\n   The PCE architecture and associated\
    \ mechanisms provide a solution to\n   avoid the use of TE aggregation and abstraction.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.4.  Traffic-Engineered Label Switched Paths\n   This document highlights the\
    \ PCE techniques and mechanisms that exist\n   for establishing TE packet and\
    \ optical Label Switched Paths (LSPs)\n   across multiple areas (inter-area TE\
    \ LSP) and ASes (inter-AS TE LSP).\n   In this context and within the remainder\
    \ of this document, we\n   consider all LSPs to be constraint based and traffic\
    \ engineered.\n   Three signaling options are defined for setting up an inter-area\
    \ or\n   inter-AS LSP [RFC4726]:\n   *  Contiguous LSP\n   *  Stitched LSP\n \
    \  *  Nested LSP\n   All three signaling methods are applicable to the architectures\
    \ and\n   procedures discussed in this document.\n"
- title: 1.5.  Inter-area and Inter-AS-capable PCE Discovery
  contents:
  - "1.5.  Inter-area and Inter-AS-capable PCE Discovery\n   When using a PCE-based\
    \ approach for inter-area and inter-AS path\n   computation, a PCE in one area\
    \ or AS may need to learn information\n   related to inter-AS-capable PCEs located\
    \ in other ASes.  The PCE\n   discovery mechanism defined in [RFC5088] and [RFC5089]\
    \ facilitates\n   the discovery of PCEs and disclosure of information related\
    \ to inter-\n   area and inter-AS-capable PCEs.\n"
- title: 1.6.  Objective Functions
  contents:
  - "1.6.  Objective Functions\n   An Objective Function (OF) [RFC5541] or a set of\
    \ OFs specifies the\n   intentions of the path computation and so defines the\
    \ \"optimality\" in\n   the context of the computation request.\n   An OF specifies\
    \ the desired outcome of a computation.  It does not\n   describe or specify the\
    \ algorithm to use.  Also, an implementation\n   may apply any algorithm or set\
    \ of algorithms to achieve the result\n   indicated by the OF.  A number of general\
    \ OFs are specified in\n   [RFC5541].\n   Various OFs may be included in the PCE\
    \ computation request to satisfy\n   the policies encoded or configured at the\
    \ PCC, and a PCE may be\n   subject to policy in determining whether it meets\
    \ the OFs included in\n   the computation request or whether it applies its own\
    \ OFs.\n   During inter-domain path computation, the selection of a domain\n \
    \  sequence, the computation of each (per-domain) path fragment, and the\n   determination\
    \ of the end-to-end path may each be subject to different\n   OFs and policies.\n"

    \ various techniques\n   can be employed to derive an optimal multi-domain path.\
    \  If the\n   domains are connected to a simple path with no branches and single\n\
    \   links between all domains or if the preferred points of\n   interconnection\
    \ are also known, the per-domain path computation\n   [RFC5152] technique may\

    \ methods to reduce the amount of information flooded\n   within the network and\
    \ make the network more manageable.  An IGP\n   hierarchy is designed to improve\
    \ IGP scalability by dividing the IGP\n   domain into areas and limiting the flooding\
