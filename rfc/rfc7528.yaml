- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   HbbTV (Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV) is a new industry\
    \ standard\n   providing an open and business-neutral technology platform that\n\
    \   seamlessly combines TV services delivered via broadcast with services\n  \
    \ delivered via broadband and also enables access to Internet-only\n   services\
    \ for consumers using connected TVs and set-top boxes.  The\n   founding members\
    \ of the HbbTV consortium together with a large group\n   of supporters jointly\
    \ developed the HbbTV specification to create a\n   global standard for hybrid\
    \ entertainment services.  Version 1.2.1 of\n   this specification was published\
    \ by ETSI as ETSI TS 102 796 [HbbTV12]\n   in November 2012.\n   The HbbTV specification\
    \ is based on existing standards and web\n   technologies including the Open IPTV\
    \ Forum (OIPF), Consumer\n   Electronics Association (CEA), Digital Video Broadcasting\
    \ (DVB), and\n   World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).  The standard provides the features\n\
    \   and functionality required to deliver feature-rich broadcast and\n   Internet\
    \ services.  Utilizing standard Internet technology, it\n   enables rapid application\
    \ development.  It defines minimum\n   requirements simplifying the implementation\
    \ in devices and leaving\n   room for differentiation; this limits the investment\
    \ required by\n   consumer electronics manufacturers to build compliant devices.\
    \  The\n   HbbTV Association is a pan-European initiative aimed at providing an\n\
    \   alternative to proprietary technologies and delivering an open\n   platform\
    \ for broadcasters to deliver value-added on-demand services\n   to the end consumer.\n\
    \   HbbTV has a wide range of supporters from across the broadcaster and\n   consumer\
    \ electronics industries.\n   HbbTV would like to assign unique, permanent, location-independent\n\
    \   names based on URNs for some resources it produces or manages.  These\n  \
    \ URNs will be constructed according to the URN syntax defined in\n   [RFC2141].\
    \  This namespace specification is for a formal namespace to\n   be registered\
    \ according to the procedures set forth in [RFC3406].\n"

  - "2.  URN Specification for the HbbTV Namespace Identifier (NID)\n   This section\
    \ provides the information required to register a formal\n   namespace according\

    \   Declaration of structure:\n      URNs assigned by HbbTV will have the following\
    \ structure based on\n      the organizational structure of the resources specified\
    \ in the\n      HbbTV specifications:\n         urn:hbbtv:<NSS>\n      where the\
    \ syntax of \"<NSS>\" is specified in Section 2.2 of the URN\n      Syntax requirements\
    \ [RFC2141].\n      The individual URNs will be assigned by HbbTV through the\
    \ process\n      of development of the HbbTV specifications.\n   Relevant ancillary\
    \ documentation:\n      None.\n   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n    \
    \  HbbTV will establish unique identifiers as appropriate and will\n      ensure\
    \ that an assigned string is never reassigned.\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n\
    \      HbbTV is committed to maintaining the accessibility and\n      persistence\
    \ of all resources that are officially assigned URNs by\n      the organization.\
    \  The registration tables and information will be\n      published and maintained\
    \ by HbbTV on its web site.\n   Process of identifier assignment:\n      The assignment\
    \ of identifiers is fully controlled and managed by\n      HbbTV.\n   Process\
    \ of identifier resolution:\n      Not applicable; the \"hbbtv\" namespace is\
    \ not listed with a\n      Resolution Discovery System.\n   Rules for Lexical\
    \ Equivalence:\n      The \"<NSS>\" is case-insensitive.\n   Conformance with\
    \ URN Syntax:\n      No special considerations.\n   Validation mechanism:\n  \
    \    None specified.  URN assignment will be managed completely and\n      published\
    \ by HbbTV.\n   Scope:\n      Global\n"

- title: 4.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Namespace Considerations\n   A unique formal namespace is required by HbbTV\
    \ in order to specify\n   how the various existing standards can be linked in\
    \ order to create a\n   true end-to-end ecosystem for standards-based IPTV deployments\
    \ and to\n   provide the necessary system-wide resources.\n   URN assignment procedures:\n\
    \      The individual URNs shall be assigned through the process of\n      development\
    \ of HbbTV specifications by the Hybrid Broadcast\n      Broadband TV Association.\
    \  The latest information about HbbTV-\n      defined specifications can always\
    \ be found at the owner's website\n      at\n         <https://hbbtv.org/pages/about_hbbtv/specification.php>\n\
    \   URN resolution/delegation:\n      The resolution and delegation shall be determined\
    \ through the\n      process of development of specifications by the HbbTV Association.\n\
    \      Since the implementations envisaged cover a wide range of devices\n   \
    \   with quite different access methods and capabilities, no single\n      resolution\
    \ or delegation mechanism can be referenced in this\n      document.\n   Type\
    \ of resources to be identified:\n      Types of resources to be identified include\
    \ XML schema definition\n      files, classification schemes, and identification\
    \ systems defined\n      and published by HbbTV.  These resources being identified\n\
    \      constitute a metadata system to describe digital multimedia\n      broadcast\
    \ services or content conveyed as part of such services.\n      The latest HbbTV-defined\
    \ specifications can always be found at\n         <https://hbbtv.org/pages/about_hbbtv/specification.php>\n"
- title: 5.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Community Considerations\n   URNs defined by HbbTV will be used by implementers\
    \ of hybrid\n   broadcast/broadband systems, services, products, and applications\n\
    \   based on the HbbTV specification.  They are an essential component of\n  \
    \ the open ecosystem that is being facilitated by HbbTV.\n   HbbTV specifications\
    \ are developed through a consensus-based process\n   by member organizations\
    \ representing most aspects of the digital\n   television ecosystem.  A full list\

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   There are no additional security considerations\
    \ other than those\n   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs\
    \ in general,\n   which are described in [RFC1737], [RFC2141], and [RFC3406].\n\
    \   This document registers a namespace for URNs.  HbbTV may assign\n   special\
    \ meaning to certain of the characters of the Namespace\n   Specific String (NSS)\
    \ in its specifications.  Any security\n   consideration resulting from such assignment\
    \ is outside the scope of\n   this document.\n"
