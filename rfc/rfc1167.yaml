- title: A WORD ON TERMINOLOGY
  contents:
  - "A WORD ON TERMINOLOGY\n   The expression \"national research and education network\"\
    \ is taken to\n   mean \"the U.S. National Research and Education Network\" in\
    \ the\n   material which follows.  It is implicitly assumed that similar\n   initiatives\
    \ may arise in other countries and that a kind of Global\n   Research and Education\
    \ Network may arise out of the existing\n   international Internet system.  However,\
    \ the primary focus of this\n   paper is on developments in the U.S.\n"
- title: FUNDAMENTALS
  contents:
  - "FUNDAMENTALS\n   1. The NREN in the U.S. will evolve from the existing Internet\
    \ base.\n   By implication, the U.S. NREN will have to fit into an international\n\
    \   environment consisting of a good many networks sponsored or owned and\n  \
    \ operated by non-U.S. organizations around the world.\n   2. There will continue\
    \ to be special-purpose and mission-oriented\n   networks sponsored by the U.S.\
    \ Government which will need to link\n   with, if not directly support, the NREN.\n\
    \   3. The basic technical networking architecture of the system will\n   include\
    \ local area networks, metropolitan, regional and wide-area\n   networks.  Some\
    \ nets will be organized to support transit traffic and\n   others will be strictly\
    \ parasitic.\n   4. Looking towards the end of the decade, some of the networks\
    \ may be\n   mobile (digital, cellular).  A variety of technologies may be used,\n\
    \   including, but not limited to, high speed Fiber Data Distribution\n   Interface\
    \ (FDDI) nets, Distributed-Queue Dual Bus (DQDB) nets,\n   Broadband Integrated\
    \ Services Digital Networks (B-ISDN) utilizing\n   Asynchronous Transfer Mode\
    \ (ATM) switching fabrics as well as\n   conventional Token Ring, Ethernet and\
    \ other IEEE 802.X technology.\n   Narrowband ISDN and X.25 packet switching technology\
    \ network services\n   are also likely play a role along with Switched Multi-megabit\
    \ Data\n   Service (SMDS) provided by telecommunications carriers.  It also\n\
    \   would be fair to ask what role FTS-2000 might play in the system, at\n   least\
    \ in support of government access to the NREN, and possibly in\n   support of\
    \ national agency network facilities.\n   5. The protocol architecture of the\
    \ system will continue to exhibit a\n   layered structure although the layering\
    \ may vary from the present-day\n   Internet and planned Open Systems Interconnection\
    \ structures in some\n   respects.\n   6. The system will include servers of varying\
    \ kinds required to\n   support the general operation of the system (for example,\
    \ network\n   management facilities, name servers of various types, email, database\n\
    \   and other kinds of information servers, multicast routers,\n   cryptographic\
    \ certificate servers) and collaboration support tools\n   including video/teleconferencing\
    \ systems and other \"groupware\"\n   facilities.  Accounting and access control\
    \ mechanisms will be\n   required.\n   7. The system will support multiple protocols\
    \ on an end to end basis.\n   At the least, full TCP/IP and OSI protocol stacks\
    \ will be supported.\n   Dealing with Connectionless and Connection-Oriented Network\
    \ Services\n   in the OSI area is an open issue (transport service bridges and\n\
    \   application level gateways are two possibilities).\n   8. Provision must be\
    \ made for experimental research in networking to\n   support the continued technical\
    \ evolution of the system.  The NREN\n   can no more be a static, rigid system\
    \ than the Internet has been\n   since its inception.  Interconnection of experimental\
    \ facilities with\n   the operational NREN must be supported.\n   9. The architecture\
    \ must accommodate the use of commercial services,\n   private and Government-sponsored\
    \ networks in the NREN system.\n   Apart from the considerations listed above,\
    \ it is also helpful to\n   consider the constituencies and stakeholders who have\
    \ a role to play\n   in the use of, provision of and evolution of NREN services.\
    \  Their\n   interests will affect the architecture of the NREN and the course\
    \ of\n   its creation and evolution.\n"
- title: NREN CONSTITUENTS
  contents:
  - "NREN CONSTITUENTS\n   The Users\n      Extrapolating from the present Internet,\
    \ the users of the system\n      will be diverse.  By legislative intent, it will\
    \ include colleges\n      and universities, government research organizations\
    \ (e.g.,\n      research laboratories of the Departments of Defense, Energy,\n\
    \      Health and Human Services, National Aeronautics and Space\n      Administration),\
    \ non-profit and for-profit research and\n      development organizations, federally\
    \ funded research and\n      development centers (FFRDCs), R&D activities of private\n\
    \      enterprise, library facilities of all kinds, and primary and\n      secondary\
    \ schools.  The system is not intended to be discipline-\n      specific.\n  \
    \    It is critical to recognize that even in the present Internet, it\n     \
    \ has been possible to accommodate a remarkable amalgam of private\n      enterprise,\
    \ academic institutions, government and military\n      facilities.  Indeed, the\
    \ very ability to accept such a diverse\n      constituency turns on the increasing\
    \ freedom of the so-called\n      intermediate-level networks to accept an unrestricted\
    \ set of\n      users.  The growth in the size and diversity of Internet users,\
    \ if\n      it can be said to have been constrained at all, has been limited\n\
    \      in part by usage constraints placed on the federally-sponsored\n      national\
    \ agency networks (e.g., NSFNET, NASA Science Internet,\n      Energy Sciences\
    \ Net, High Energy Physics Net, the recently\n      deceased ARPANET, Defense\
    \ Research Internet, etc.).  Given the\n      purposes of these networks and the\
    \ fiduciary responsibilities of\n      the agencies that have created them, such\
    \ usage constraints seem\n      highly appropriate.  It may be beneficial to search\
    \ for less\n      constraining architectural paradigms, perhaps through the use\
    \ of\n      backbone facilities which are not federally-sponsored.\n      The\
    \ Internet does not quite serve the public in the same sense\n      that the telephone\
    \ network(s) do (i.e., the Internet is not a\n      common carrier), although\
    \ the linkages between the Internet and\n      public electronic mail systems,\
    \ private bulletin board systems\n      such as FIDONET and commercial network\
    \ services such as UUNET,\n      ALTERNET and PSI, for example, make the system\
    \ extremely\n      accessible to a very wide variety of users.\n      It will\
    \ be important to keep in mind that, over time, an\n      increasing number of\
    \ institutional users will support local area\n      networks and will want to\
    \ gain access to NREN by that means.\n      Individual use will continue to rely\
    \ on dial-up access and, as it\n      is deployed, narrow-band ISDN.  Eventually,\
    \ metropolitan area\n      networks and broadband ISDN facilities may be used\
    \ to support\n      access to NREN.  Cellular radio or other mobile communication\n\
    \      technologies may also become increasingly popular as access tools.\n  \
    \ The Service Providers\n      In its earliest stages, the Internet consisted\
    \ solely of\n      government-sponsored networks such as the Defense Department's\n\
    \      ARPANET, Packet Radio Networks and Packet Satellite Networks.\n      With\
    \ the introduction of Xerox PARC's Ethernet, however, things\n      began to change\
    \ and privately owned and operated networks became\n      an integral part of\
    \ the Internet architecture.\n      For a time, there was a mixture of government-sponsored\
    \ backbone\n      facilities and private local area networks.  With the introduction\n\
    \      of the National Science Foundation NSFNET, however, the\n      architecture\
    \ changed again to include intermediate-level networks\n      consisting of collections\
    \ of commercially-produced routers and\n      trunk or access lines which connected\
    \ local area network\n      facilities to the government-sponsored backbones.\
    \  The\n      government-sponsored supercomputer centers (such as the National\n\
    \      Aerospace Simulator at NASA/AMES, the Magnetic Fusion Energy\n      Computing\
    \ Center at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory and the half-\n      dozen or so NSF-sponsored\
    \ supercomputer centers) fostered the\n      growth of communications networks\
    \ specifically to support\n      supercomputer access although, over time, these\
    \ have tended to\n      look more and more like general-purpose intermediate-level\n\
    \      networks.\n      Many, but not all, of the intermediate-level networks\
    \ applied for\n      and received seed funding from the National Science Foundation.\n\
    \      It was and continues to be NSF's position, however, that such\n      direct\
    \ subsidies should diminish over time and that the\n      intermediate networks\
    \ should become self-sustaining.  To\n      accomplish this objective, the intermediate-level\
    \ networks have\n      been turning to an increasingly diverse user constituency\
    \ (see\n      section above).\n      The basic model of government backbones,\
    \ consortium intermediate\n      level nets and private local area networks has\
    \ served reasonably\n      well during the 1980's but it would appear that newer\n\
    \      telecommunications technologies may suggest another potential\n      paradigm.\
    \  As the NSFNET moves towards higher speed backbone\n      operation in the 45\
    \ Mb/s range, the importance of carrier\n      participation in the enterprise\
    \ has increased.  The provision of\n      backbone capacity at attractive rates\
    \ by the inter-exchange\n      carrier (in this case, MCI Communications Corporation)\
    \ has been\n      crucial to the feasibility of deploying such a high speed system.\n\
    \      As the third phase of the NREN effort gets underway, it is\n      becoming\
    \ increasingly apparent that the \"federally-funded\n      backbone\" model may\
    \ and perhaps even should or must give way to a\n      vision of commercially\
    \ operated, gigabit speed systems to which\n      the users of the NREN have access.\
    \  If there is federal subsidy in\n      the new paradigm, it might come through\
    \ direct provision of\n      support for networking at the level of individual\
    \ research grant\n      or possibly through a system of institutional vouchers\
    \ permitting\n      and perhaps even mandating institution-wide network planning\
    \ and\n      provision.  This differs from the present model in which the\n  \
    \    backbone networks are essentially federally owned and operated or\n     \
    \ enjoy significant, direct federal support to the provider of the\n      service.\n\
    \      The importance of such a shift in service provision philosophy\n      cannot\
    \ be over-emphasized.  In the long run, it eliminates\n      unnecessary restrictions\
    \ on the use and application of the\n      backbone facilities, opening up possibilities\
    \ for true ubiquity of\n      access and use without the need for federal control,\
    \ except to the\n      extent that any such services are considered in need of\n\
    \      regulation, perhaps.  The same arguments might be made for the\n      intermediate\
    \ level systems (metropolitan and regional area access\n      networks).  This\
    \ does NOT mean that private networks ranging from\n      local consortia to inter-continental\
    \ systems will be ruled out.\n      The economics of private networking may still\
    \ be favorable for\n      sufficiently heavy usage.  It does suggest, however,\
    \ that\n      achieving scale and ubiquity may largely rely on publicly\n    \
    \  accessible facilities.\n   The Vendors\n      Apart from service provision,\
    \ the technology available to the\n      users and the service providers will\
    \ come largely from commercial\n      sources.  A possible exception to this may\
    \ be the switches used in\n      the gigabit testbed effort, but ultimately, even\
    \ this technology\n      will have to be provided commercially if the system is\
    \ to achieve\n      the scale necessary to serve as the backbone of the NREN.\n\
    \      An important consequence of this observation is that the NREN\n      architecture\
    \ should be fashioned in such a way that it can be\n      constructed from technology\
    \ compatible with carrier plans and\n      available from commercial telecommunications\
    \ equipment suppliers.\n      Examples include the use of SONET (Synchronous Optical\
    \ Network)\n      optical transmission technology, Switched Multimegabit Data\n\
    \      Services offerings (metropolitan area networks), Asynchronous\n      Transmission\
    \ Mode (ATM) switches, frame relays, high speed,\n      multi-protocol routers,\
    \ and so on.  It is somewhat unclear what\n      role the public X.25 networks\
    \ will play, especially where narrow\n      and broadband ISDN services are available,\
    \ but it is also not\n      obvious that they ought to be written off at this\
    \ point.  Where\n      there is still research and development activity (such\
    \ as in\n      network management), the network R&D community can contribute\n\
    \      through experimental efforts and through participation in\n      standards-making\
    \ activities (e.g., ANSI, NIST, IAB/IETF, Open\n      NMF).\n"
- title: OPERATIONS
  contents:
  - "OPERATIONS\n   It seems clear that the current Internet and the anticipated NREN\n\
    \   will have to function in a highly distributed fashion.  Given the\n   diversity\
    \ of service providers and the richness of the constituent\n   networks (as to\
    \ technology and ownership), there will have to be a\n   good deal of collaboration\
    \ and cooperation to make the system work.\n   One can see the necessity for this,\
    \ based on the existing voice\n   network in the U.S.  with its local and inter-exchange\
    \ carrier (IEC)\n   structure.  It should be noted that in the presence of the\
    \ local and\n   IEC structure, it has proven possible to support private and virtual\n\
    \   private networking as well.  The same needs to be true of the NREN.\n   A\
    \ critical element of any commercial service is accounting and\n   billing.  It\
    \ must be possible to identify users (billable parties,\n   anyway) and to compute\
    \ usage charges.  This is not to say that the\n   NREN component networks must\
    \ necessarily bill on the basis of usage.\n   It may prove preferable to have\
    \ fixed access charges which might be\n   modulated by access data rate, as some\
    \ of the intermediate-level\n   networks have found.  It would not be surprising\
    \ to find a mixture of\n   charging policies in which usage charges are preferable\
    \ for small\n   amounts of use and flat rate charges are preferred for high volume\n\
    \   use.\n   It will be critical to establish a forum in which operational matters\n\
    \   can be debated and methods established to allow cooperative operation\n  \
    \ of the entire system.  A number of possibilities present themselves:\n   use\
    \ of the Internet Engineering Task Force as a basis, use of\n   existing telecommunication\
    \ carrier organizations, or possibly a\n   consortium of all service providers\
    \ (and private network operators?).\n   Even if such an activity is initiated\
    \ through federal action, it may\n   be helpful, in the long run, if it eventually\
    \ embraces a much wider\n   community.\n   Agreements are needed on the technical\
    \ foundations for network\n   monitoring and management, for internetwork accounting\
    \ and exchange\n   payments, for problem identification, tracking, escalation\
    \ and\n   resolution.  A framework is needed for the support of users of the\n\
    \   aggregate NREN.  This suggests cooperative agreements among network\n   information\
    \ centers, user service and support organizations to begin\n   with.  Eventually,\
    \ the cost of such operations will have to be\n   incorporated into the general\
    \ cost of service provision.  The federal\n   role, even if it acts as catalyst\
    \ in the initial stages, may\n   ultimately focus on the direct support of the\
    \ users of the system\n   which it finds it appropriate to support and subsidize\
    \ (e.g., the\n   research and educational users of the NREN).\n   A voucher system\
    \ has been proposed, in the case of the NREN, which\n   would permit users to\
    \ choose which NREN service provider(s) to\n   engage.  The vouchers might be\
    \ redeemed by the service providers in\n   the same sort of way that food stamps\
    \ are redeemed by supermarkets.\n   Over time, the cost of the vouchers could\
    \ change so that an initial\n   high subsidy from the federal government would\
    \ diminish until the\n   utility of the vouchers vanished and decisions would\
    \ be made to\n   purchase telecommunications services on a pure cost/benefit basis.\n"
- title: IMPORTANCE OF COMMERCIAL INTERESTS
  contents:
  - "IMPORTANCE OF COMMERCIAL INTERESTS\n   The initial technical architecture should\
    \ incorporate commercial\n   service provision where possible so as to avoid the\
    \ creation of a\n   system which is solely reliant on the federal government for\
    \ its\n   support and operation.  It is anticipated that a hybrid system will\n\
    \   develop but, for example, it is possible that the gigabit backbone\n   components\
    \ of the system might be strictly commercial from the start,\n   even if the lower\
    \ speed components of the NREN vary from private, to\n   public to federally subsidized\
    \ or owned and operated.\n"
- title: CONCLUSIONS
  contents:
  - "CONCLUSIONS\n   The idea of creating a National Research and Education Network\
    \ has\n   captured the attention and enthusiasm of an extraordinarily broad\n\
    \   collection of interested parties.  I believe this is in part a\n   consequence\
    \ of the remarkable range of new services and facilities\n   which could be provided\
    \ once the network infrastructure is in place.\n   If the technology of the NREN\
    \ is commercially viable, one can readily\n   imagine that an economic engine\
    \ of considerable proportions might\n   result from the widespread accessibility\
    \ of NREN-like facilities to\n   business sector.\n"
