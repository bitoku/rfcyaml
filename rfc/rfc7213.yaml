  - "1.  Introduction\n   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) [RFC5921] is the set\
    \ of protocol\n   functions that meet the requirements [RFC5654] for the application\
    \ of\n   MPLS to the construction and operation of packet-switched transport\n\
    \   networks.  The MPLS-TP data plane consists of those MPLS-TP functions\n  \
    \ concerned with the encapsulation and forwarding of MPLS-TP packets\n   and is\
    \ described in [RFC5960].\n   This document presents considerations for link-layer\
    \ addressing of\n   Ethernet frames carrying MPLS-TP packets.  Since MPLS-TP packets\
    \ are\n   MPLS packets, existing procedures ([RFC3032], [RFC5332]) for the\n \
    \  encapsulation of MPLS packets over Ethernet apply.  Because IP\n   functionality\
    \ is optional in an MPLS-TP network, IP-based protocols\n   for Media Access Control\
    \ (MAC) address learning, such as the Address\n   Resolution Protocol (ARP) [RFC826]\
    \ and IPv6 Neighbor Discovery\n   [RFC4861], may not be available.  This document\
    \ specifies the options\n   for the determination and selection of the next-hop\
    \ Ethernet MAC\n   address when MPLS-TP is used between nodes that do not have\
    \ an IP\n   data plane.\n"

- title: 2.  Point-to-Point Link Addressing
  contents:
  - "2.  Point-to-Point Link Addressing\n   When two MPLS-TP nodes are connected by\
    \ a point-to-point Ethernet\n   link, the question arises as to what destination\
    \ Ethernet Media\n   Access Control (MAC) address should be specified in Ethernet\
    \ frames\n   transmitted to the peer node over the link.  The problem of\n   determining\
    \ this address does not arise in IP/MPLS networks because\n   of the presence\
    \ of the Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol (commonly\n   referred to as the\
    \ Address Resolution Protocol and shortened to ARP)\n   [RFC826] or IPv6 Neighbor\
    \ Discovery (ND) protocol [RFC4861], which\n   allow the unicast MAC address of\
    \ the peer device to be learned\n   dynamically.\n   If existing mechanisms are\
    \ available in an MPLS-TP network to\n   determine the destination unicast MAC\
    \ addresses of peer nodes, for\n   example, if the network also happens to be\
    \ an IP/MPLS network, or if\n   the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) [LLDP]\
    \ is in use, these\n   methods SHOULD be used.  If ARP, ND, and LLDP are not available,\
    \ and\n   both peers implement the procedures in Section 4 of this document,\n\
    \   then the GAP mechanism described in this memo SHOULD be used.  The\n   remainder\
    \ of this section discusses alternative options that might be\n   employed when\
    \ none of the preceding mechanisms for learning MAC\n   addresses are available.\n\
    \   One common approach is for each node to be statically configured with\n  \
    \ the MAC address of its peer.  However, static MAC address\n   configuration\
    \ can present an administrative burden and lead to\n   operational problems. \
    \ For example, replacement of an Ethernet\n   interface to resolve a hardware\
    \ fault when this approach is used\n   requires that the peer node be manually\
    \ reconfigured with the new MAC\n   address.  This is especially problematic if\
    \ the peer is operated by\n   another provider.\n   Another approach that may\
    \ be considered is to use the Ethernet\n   broadcast address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF\
    \ as the destination MAC address in\n   frames carrying MPLS-TP packets over a\
    \ link that is known to be\n   point-to-point.  This may, however, lead to excessive\
    \ frame\n   distribution and processing at the Ethernet layer.  Broadcast traffic\n\
    \   may also be treated specially by some devices, and this may not be\n   desirable\
    \ for MPLS-TP data frames.\n   In view of the above considerations, this document\
    \ recommends that,\n   if a non-negotiated address is to be used, both nodes are\
    \ configured\n   to use as a destination MAC address an Ethernet multicast address\n\
    \   reserved for MPLS-TP for use over point-to-point links.  The address\n   allocated\
    \ for this purpose by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority\n   (IANA) is 01-00-5E-90-00-00.\
    \  An MPLS-TP implementation MUST default\n   to passing to the MPLS sub-system\
    \ any MPLS packets received from a\n   point-to-point Ethernet link with this\
    \ destination MAC address.\n   The use of broadcast or multicast addressing for\
    \ the purpose\n   described in this section, i.e., as a placeholder for the unknown\n\
    \   unicast MAC address of the destination, is applicable only when the\n   attached\
    \ Ethernet link is known to be point-to-point.  If a link is\n   not known to\
    \ be point-to-point, these forms of broadcast or multicast\n   addressing MUST\
    \ NOT be used.  Thus, the implementation MUST provide a\n   means for the operator\
    \ to declare that a link is point-to-point if it\n   supports these addressing\
    \ modes.  Moreover, the operator is cautioned\n   that it is not always clear\
    \ whether a given link is, or will remain,\n   strictly point-to-point, particularly\
    \ when the link is supplied by an\n   external provider; point-to-point declarations\
    \ therefore need to be\n   used with care.  Because of these caveats, it is RECOMMENDED\
    \ that\n   implementations support the procedures in Section 4 so that unicast\n\
    \   addressing can be used.\n"
- title: 3.  Multipoint Link Addressing
  contents:
  - "3.  Multipoint Link Addressing\n   When a multipoint Ethernet link serves as\
    \ a section [RFC5960] for a\n   point-to-multipoint MPLS-TP LSP, and multicast\
    \ destination MAC\n   addressing at the Ethernet layer is used for the LSP, the\
    \ addressing\n   and encapsulation procedures specified in [RFC5332] SHALL be\
    \ used.\n   When a multipoint Ethernet link (that is, a link that is not known\
    \ to\n   be point-to-point) serves as a section for a point-to-point MPLS-TP\n\
    \   LSP, unicast destination MAC addresses MUST be used for Ethernet\n   frames\
    \ carrying packets of the LSP.  According to the discussion in\n   the previous\
    \ section, this implies the use of either static MAC\n   address configuration\
    \ or a protocol that enables peer MAC address\n   discovery.\n"
- title: 4.  MAC Address Discovery via the G-ACh Advertisement Protocol
  contents:
  - "4.  MAC Address Discovery via the G-ACh Advertisement Protocol\n   The G-ACh\
    \ Advertisement Protocol (GAP) [RFC7212] provides a simple\n   means of informing\
    \ listeners on a link of the sender's capabilities\n   and configuration.  When\
    \ used for this purpose on an Ethernet link,\n   GAP messages are multicast to\
    \ the address 01-00-5e-80-00-0d (see\n   Section 7 of [RFC7212]).  If these messages\
    \ contain the unicast MAC\n   address of the sender, then listeners can learn\
    \ this address and use\n   it in the future when transmitting frames containing\
    \ MPLS-TP packets.\n   Since the GAP does not rely on IP, this provides a means\
    \ of unicast\n   MAC discovery for MPLS-TP nodes without IP support.\n   This\
    \ document defines a new GAP application \"Ethernet Interface\n   Parameters\"\
    \ (0x0001) to support the advertisement of Ethernet-\n   specific parameters associated\
    \ with the sending interface.  The\n   following Type-Length-Value (TLV) objects\
    \ are defined for this\n   application; the TLV format is as defined in [RFC7212]:\n\
    \      Source MAC Address (type = 0, length = 8): The Value of this\n      object\
    \ is an EUI-64 [EUI-64] unicast MAC address assigned to one\n      of the interfaces\
    \ of the sender that is connected to this data\n      link.  The IEEE-defined\
    \ mapping from 48-bit MAC addresses to\n      EUI-64 form is used.\n      Maximum\
    \ Frame Size (MFS) (type = 1, length = 4): The Value of this\n      object is\
    \ a 32-bit unsigned integer encoded in network byte order\n      that specifies\
    \ the maximum frame size in octets of an Ethernet\n      Frame that can be sent\
    \ over the sending interface.  Where MAC\n      address learning occurs by some\
    \ other means, this TLV group MAY be\n      used to advertise only the MFS.  If\
    \ multiple advertisements are\n      made for the same parameter, use of these\

    \                             MFS Object Format\n   Per [RFC7212], MAC address\
    \ discovery information needs to be\n   periodically retransmitted and is to be\
    \ retained by a receiver based\n   on the period of time indicated by the associated\
    \ Lifetime field.  To\n   expedite the initialization of a link, it is RECOMMENDED\
    \ that a node\n   that has been reconfigured, rebooted, or is aware that it has\
    \ been\n   disconnected from its peer send a GAP Ethernet Interface Parameters\n\
    \   message, and that it issue a GAP Request message for the Ethernet\n   Interface\
    \ Parameters of its peers, at the earliest opportunity.\n   When the MAC address\
    \ in the received Source MAC Address TLV changes,\n   the new MAC address MUST\
    \ be used (see Section 5.2 of [RFC7212]).\n   If a minimum MFS is configured for\
    \ a link and the MFS advertised by\n   the peer is lower than that minimum, the\
    \ operator MUST be notified of\n   the MFS mismatch.  Under these circumstances,\
    \ the operator may choose\n   to configure the LSR to shut down the link, thereby\
    \ triggering a\n   fault and causing the end-to-end path to be repaired.  Alternatively,\n\
    \   the operator may choose to configure the LSR to leave the link up so\n   that\
    \ an OAM message can be used to verify the actual MFS.\n   A peer node could cease\
    \ transmission of G-ACh advertisements, or\n   cease to include a Source MAC Address\
    \ TLV in advertisements, or cease\n   to be connected, any of which will cause\
    \ the TLV lifetime to expire.\n   After the Source MAC Address TLV lifetime has\
    \ expired, this MAC\n   Address MUST NOT be used as the peer MAC address.  The\
    \ node MUST\n   return to selecting MAC addresses as though no advertisements\
    \ were\n   received, using the method configured for this eventuality.\n"

    \ in\n   such frames being distributed to devices other than the intended\n  \
    \ destination node or nodes when the Ethernet link is not point-to-\n   point.\
    \  The operator should take care to ensure that MPLS-TP nodes\n   are aware of\
    \ the Ethernet link type (point-to-point or multipoint).\n   In the case of multipoint\
    \ links, the operator should either ensure\n   that no devices are attached to\
