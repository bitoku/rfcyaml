  - "3. Motivations\n   An enterprise may acquire its Internet connectivity from more\
    \ than\n   one Internet Service Provider (ISP) for some of the following\n   reasons.\
    \  Maintaining connectivity via more than one ISP could be\n   viewed as a way\
    \ to make connectivity to the Internet more reliable.\n   This way when connectivity\
    \ through one of the ISPs fails,\n   connectivity via the other ISP(s) would enable\
    \ the enterprise to\n   preserve its connectivity to the Internet. In addition\
    \ to providing\n   more reliable connectivity, maintaining connectivity via more\
    \ than\n   one ISP could also allow the enterprise to distribute load among\n\
    \   multiple connections. For enterprises that span wide geographical\n   area\
    \ this could also enable better (more optimal) routing.\n   The above considerations,\
    \ combined with the decreasing prices for the\n   Internet connectivity, motivate\
    \ more and more enterprises to become\n   multi-homed to multiple ISPs. At the\
    \ same time, the routing overhead\n   that such enterprises impose on the Internet\
    \ routing system becomes\n   more and more significant. Scaling the Internet,\
    \ and being able to\n   support a growing number of such enterprises demands mechanism(s)\
    \ to\n   contain this overhead. This document assumes that an approach where\n\
    \   routers in the \"default-free\" zone of the Internet would be required\n \
    \  to maintain a route for every multi-homed enterprise that is\n   connected\
    \ to multiple ISPs does not provide an adequate scaling.\n   Moreover, given the\
    \ nature of the Internet, this document assumes\n   that any approach to handle\
    \ routing for such enterprises should\n   minimize the amount of coordination\
    \ among ISPs, and especially the\n   ISPs that are not directly connected to these\
    \ enterprises.\n   There is a difference of opinions on whether the driving factors\n\
    \   behind multi-homing to multiple ISPs could be adequately addressed by\n  \
    \ multi-homing just to a single ISP, which would in turn eliminate the\n   negative\
    \ impact of multi-homing on the Internet routing system.\n   Discussion of this\
    \ topic is beyond the scope of this document.\n   The focus of this document is\
    \ on the routing and addressing\n   strategies that could reduce the routing overhead\
    \ due to multi-homed\n   enterprises connected to multiple ISPs in the Internet\
    \ routing\n   system.\n   The strategies described in this document are equally\
    \ applicable to\n   both IPv4 and IPv6.\n"
- title: 4. Address allocation and assignment
  contents:
  - "4. Address allocation and assignment\n   A multi-homed enterprise connected to\
    \ a set of ISPs would be\n   allocated a block of addresses (address prefix) by\
    \ each of these ISPs\n   (an enterprise connected to N ISPs would get N different\
    \ blocks).\n   The address allocation from the ISPs to the enterprise would be\
    \ based\n   on the \"address-lending\" policy [RFC2008]. The allocated addresses\n\
    \   then would be used for address assignment within the enterprise.\n   One possible\
    \ address assignment plan that the enterprise could employ\n   is to use the topological\
    \ proximity of a node (host) to a particular\n   ISP (to the interconnect between\
    \ the enterprise and the ISP) as a\n   criteria for selecting which of the address\
    \ prefixes to use for\n   address assignment to the node. A particular node (host)\
    \ may be\n   assigned address(es) out of a single prefix, or may have addresses\n\
    \   from different prefixes.\n"
- title: 5. Routing information exchange
  contents:
  - "5. Routing information exchange\n   The issue of routing information exchange\
    \ between an enterprise and\n   its ISPs is decomposed into the following components:\n\
    \      a) reachability information that an enterprise border router\n      advertises\
    \ to a border router within an ISP\n      b) reachability information that a border\
    \ router within an ISP\n      advertises to an enterprise border router\n   The\
    \ primary focus of this document is on (a); (b) is covered only as\n   needed\
    \ by this document.\n"
- title: 5.1. Advertising reachability information by enterprise border routers
  contents:
  - "5.1. Advertising reachability information by enterprise border routers\n   When\
    \ an enterprise border router connected to a particular ISP\n   determines that\
    \ the connectivity between the enterprise and the\n   Internet is up through all\
    \ of its ISPs, the router advertises (to the\n   border router of that ISP) reachability\
    \ to only the address prefix\n   that the ISP allocated to the enterprise. This\
    \ way in a steady state\n   routes injected by the enterprise into its ISPs are\
    \ aggregated by\n   these ISPs, and are not propagated into the \"default-free\"\
    \ zone of\n   the Internet.\n   When an enterprise border router connected to\
    \ a particular ISP\n   detemrines that the connectivity between the enterprise\
    \ and the\n   Internet through one or more of its other ISPs is down, the router\n\
    \   starts advertising reachability to the address prefixes that was\n   allocated\
    \ by these ISPs to the enterprise. This would result in\n   injecting additional\
    \ routing information into the \"default-free\" zone\n   of the Internet. However,\
    \ one could observe that the probability of\n   all multi-homed enterprises in\
    \ the Internet concurrently losing\n   connectivity to the Internet through one\
    \ or more of their ISPs is\n   fairly small.  Thus on average the number of additional\
    \ routes in the\n   \"default-free\" zone of the Internet due to multi-homed enterprises\
    \ is\n   expected to be a small fraction of the total number of such\n   enterprises.\n\
    \   The approach described above is predicated on the assumption that an\n   enterprise\
    \ border router has a mechanism(s) by which it could\n   determine (a) whether\
    \ the connectivity to the Internet through some\n   other border router of that\
    \ enterprise is up or down, and (b) the\n   address prefix that was allocated\
    \ to the enterprise by the ISP\n   connected to the other border router. One such\
    \ possible mechanism\n   could be provided by BGP [RFC1771]. In this case border\
    \ routers\n   within the enterprise would have an IBGP peering with each other.\n\
    \   Whenever one border router determines that the intersection between\n   the\
    \ set of reachable destinations it receives via its EBGP (from its\n   directly\
    \ connected ISP) peerings and the set of reachable\n   destinations it receives\
    \ from another border router (in the same\n   enterprise) via IBGP is empty, the\
    \ border router would start\n   advertising to its external peer reachability\
    \ to the address prefix\n   that was allocated to the enterprise by the ISP connected\
    \ to the\n   other border router. The other border router would advertise (via\n\
    \   IBGP) the address prefix that was allocated to the enterprise by the\n   ISP\
    \ connected to that router. This approach is known as \"auto route\n   injection\"\
    .\n   As an illustration consider an enterprise connected to two ISPs,\n   ISP-A\
    \ and ISP-B. Denote the enterprise border router that connects\n   the enterprise\
    \ to ISP-A as BR-A; denote the enterprise border router\n   that connects the\
    \ enterprise to ISP-B as BR-B. Denote the address\n   prefix that ISP-A allocated\
    \ to the enterprise as Pref-A; denote the\n   address prefix that ISP-B allocated\
    \ to the enterprise as Pref-B.\n   When the set of routes BR-A receives from ISP-A\
    \ (via EBGP) has a\n   non-empty intersection with the set of routes BR-A receives\
    \ from BR-B\n   (via IBGP), BR-A advertises to ISP-A only the reachability to\
    \ Pref-A.\n   When the intersection becomes empty, BR-A would advertise to ISP-A\n\
    \   reachability to both Pref-A and Pref-B. This would continue for as\n   long\
    \ as the intersection remains empty. Once the intersection becomes\n   non-empty,\
    \ BR-A would stop advertising reachability to Pref-B to\n   ISP-A (but would still\
    \ continue to advertise reachability to Pref-A\n   to ISP-A). Figure 1 below describes\
    \ this method graphically.\n        +-------+    +-------+         +-------+ \

    \ information advertised\n   Although strictly an implementation detail, calculating\
    \ the\n   intersection could potentially be a costly operation for a large set\n\
    \   of routes. An alternate solution to this is to make use of a selected\n  \
    \ single (or more) address prefix received from an ISP (the ISP's\n   backbone\
    \ route for example) and configure the enterprise border\n   router to perform\
    \ auto route injection if the selected prefix is not\n   present via IBGP. Let's\
    \ suppose ISP-B has a well known address\n   prefix, ISP-Pref-B for its backbone.\
    \ ISP-B advertises this to BR-B\n   and BR-B in turn advertises this via IBGP\
    \ to BR-A. If BR-A sees a\n   withdraw for ISP-Pref-B it advertises Pref-B to\
    \ ISP-A.\n   The approach described in this section may produce less than the\
    \ full\n   Internet-wide connectivity in the presence of ISPs that filter out\n\
    \   routes based on the length of their address prefixes. One could\n   observe\
    \ however, that this would be a problem regardless of how the\n   enterprise would\
    \ set up its routing and addressing.\n"
- title: 5.2. Further improvements
  contents:
  - "5.2. Further improvements\n   The approach described in the previous section\
    \ allows to\n   significantly reduce the routing overhead in the \"default-free\"\
    \ zone\n   of the Internet due to multi-homed enterprises. The approach\n   described\
    \ in this section allows to completely eliminate this\n   overhead.\n   An enterprise\
    \ border router would maintain EBGP peering not just with\n   the directly connected\
    \ border router of an ISP, but with the border\n   router(s) in one or more ISPs\
    \ that have their border routers directly\n   connected to the other border routers\
    \ within the enterprise.  We\n   refer to such peering as \"non-direct\" EBGP.\n\
    \   An ISP that maintains both direct and non-direct EBGP peering with a\n   particular\
    \ enterprise would advertise the same set of routes over\n   both of these peerings.\
    \ An enterprise border router that maintains\n   either direct or non-direct peering\
    \ with an ISP advertises to that\n   ISP reachability to the address prefix that\
    \ was allocated by that ISP\n   to the enterprise.  Within the ISP routes received\
    \ over direct\n   peering should be preferred over routes received over non-direct\n\
    \   peering.  Likewise, within the enterprise routes received over direct\n  \
    \ peering should be preferred over routes received over non-direct\n   peering.\n\
    \   Forwarding along a route received over non-direct peering should be\n   accomplished\
    \ via encapsulation [RFC1773].\n   As an illustration consider an enterprise connected\
    \ to two ISPs,\n   ISP-A and ISP-B. Denote the enterprise border router that connects\n\
    \   the enterprise to ISP-A as E-BR-A, and the ISP-A border router that\n   is\
    \ connected to E-BR-A as ISP-BR-A; denote the enterprise border\n   router that\
    \ connects the enterprise to ISP-B as E-BR-B, and the ISP-B\n   border router\
    \ that is connected to E-BR-B as ISP-BR-B. Denote the\n   address prefix that\
    \ ISP-A allocated to the enterprise as Pref-A;\n   denote the address prefix that\
    \ ISP-B allocated to the enterprise as\n   Pref-B.  E-BR-A maintains direct EBGP\
    \ peering with ISP-BR-A and\n   advertises reachability to Pref-A over that peering.\
    \ E-BR-A also\n   maintain a non-direct EBGP peering with ISP-BR-B and advertises\n\
    \   reachability to Pref-B over that peering. E-BR-B maintains direct\n   EBGP\
    \ peering with ISP-BR-B, and advertises reachability to Pref-B\n   over that peering.\
    \  E-BR-B also maintains a non-direct EBGP peering\n   with ISP-BR-A, and advertises\
    \ reachability to Pref-A over that\n   peering.\n   When connectivity between\
    \ the enterprise and both of its ISPs (ISP-A\n   and ISP-B is up, traffic destined\
    \ to hosts whose addresses were\n   assigned out of Pref-A would flow through\
    \ ISP-A to ISP-BR-A to E-BR-\n   A, and then into the enterprise. Likewise, traffic\
    \ destined to hosts\n   whose addresses were assigned out of Pref-B would flow\
    \ through ISP-B\n   to ISP-BR-B to E-BR-B, and then into the enterprise. Now consider\n\
    \   what would happen when connectivity between ISP-BR-B and E-BR-B goes\n   down.\
    \  In this case traffic to hosts whose addresses were assigned\n   out of Pref-A\
    \ would be handled as before. But traffic to hosts whose\n   addresses were assigned\
    \ out of Pref-B would flow through ISP-B to\n   ISP-BR-B, ISP-BR-B would encapsulate\
    \ this traffic and send it to E-\n   BR-A, where the traffic will get decapsulated\
    \ and then be sent into\n   the enterprise. Figure 2 below describes this approach\

    \   Figure 2: Reachability information advertised via non-direct EBGP\n   Observe\
    \ that with this scheme there is no additional routing\n   information due to\
    \ multi-homed enterprises that has to be carried in\n   the \"default-free\" zone\
    \ of the Internet. In addition this scheme\n   doesn't degrade in the presence\
    \ of ISPs that filter out routes based\n   on the length of their address prefixes.\n\
    \   Note that the set of routers within an ISP that maintain non-direct\n   peering\
    \ with the border routers within an enterprise doesn't have to\n   be restricted\
    \ to the ISP's border routers that have direct peering\n   with the enterprise's\
    \ border routers. The non-direct peering could be\n   maintained with any router\
    \ within the ISP. Doing this could improve\n   the overall robustness in the presence\
    \ of failures within the ISP.\n"

- title: 5.4. Better (more optimal) routing in steady state
  contents:
  - "5.4. Better (more optimal) routing in steady state\n   The approach described\
    \ in this document assumes that in a steady\n   state an enterprise border router\
    \ would advertise to a directly\n   connected ISP border router only the reachability\
    \ to the address\n   prefix that this ISP allocated to the enterprise. As a result,\n\

    \ to multiple\n   ISPs.  The following briefly reviews the alternatives being\
    \ used\n   today, and compares them with the approaches described above.\n"
- title: 6.1. Solution 1
  contents:
  - "6.1. Solution 1\n   One possible solution suggested in [RFC1518] is for each\
    \ multi-homed\n   enterprise to obtain its IP address space independently from\
    \ the ISPs\n   to which it is attached.  This allows each multi-homed enterprise\
    \ to\n   base its IP assignments on a single prefix, and to thereby summarize\n\
    \   the set of all IP addresses reachable within that enterprise via a\n   single\
    \ prefix.  The disadvantage of this approach is that since the\n   IP address\
    \ for that enterprise has no relationship to the addresses\n   of any particular\
    \ ISPs, the reachability information advertised by\n   the enterprise is not aggregatable\
    \ with any, but default route.\n   results in the routing overhead in the \"default-free\"\
    \ zone of the\n   Internet of O(N), where N is the total number of multi-homed\n\
    \   enterprises across the whole Internet that are connected to multiple\n   ISPs.\n\
    \   As a result, this approach can't be viewed as a viable alternative\n   for\
    \ all, but the enterprises that provide high enough degree of\n   addressing information\
    \ aggregation. Since by definition the number of\n   such enterprises is likely\
    \ to be fairly small, this approach isn't\n   viable for most of the multi-homed\
    \ enterprises connected to multiple\n   ISPs.\n"
- title: 6.2. Solution 2
  contents:
  - "6.2. Solution 2\n   Another possible solution suggested in [RFC1518] is to assign\
    \ each\n   multi-homed enterprise a single address prefix, based on one of its\n\
    \   connections to one of its ISPs.  Other ISPs to which the multi-homed\n   enterprise\
    \ is attached maintain a routing table entry for the\n   organization, but are\
    \ extremely selective in terms of which other\n   ISPs are told of this route\
    \ and would need to perform \"proxy\"\n   aggregation.  Most of the complexity\
    \ associated with this approach is\n   due to the need to perform \"proxy\" aggregation,\
    \ which in turn\n   requires t addiional inter-ISP coordination and more complex\
    \ router\n   configuration.\n"
- title: 7. Discussion
  contents:
  - "7. Discussion\n   The approach described in this document assumes that addresses\
    \ that\n   an enterprise would use are allocated based on the \"address lending\"\
    \n   policy. Consequently, whenever an enterprise changes its ISP, the\n   enterprise\
    \ would need to renumber part of its network that was\n   numbered out of the\
    \ address block that the ISP allocated to the\n   enterprise.  However, these\
    \ issues are not specific to multihoming\n   and should be considered accepted\
    \ practice in todays internet. The\n   approach described in this document effectively\
    \ eliminates any\n   distinction between single-home and multi-homed enterprise\
    \ with\n   respect to the impact of changing ISPs on renumbering.\n   The approach\
    \ described in this document also requires careful address\n   assignment within\
    \ an enterprise, as address assignment impacts\n   traffic distribution among\
    \ multiple connections between an enterprise\n   and its ISPs.\n   Both the issue\
    \ of address assignment and renumbering could be\n   addressed by the appropriate\
    \ use of network address translation\n   (NAT). The use of NAT for multi-homed\
    \ enterprises is the beyond the\n   scope of this document.\n   Use of auto route\
    \ injection (as described in Section 5.1) increases\n   the number of routers\
    \ in the default-free zone of the Internet that\n   could be affected by changes\
    \ in the connectivity of multi-homed\n   enterprises, as compared to the use of\
    \ provider-independed addresses\n   (as described in Section 6.1).  Specifically,\
    \ with auto route\n   injection when a multi-homed enterprise loses its connectivity\n\
    \   through one of its ISPs, the auto injected route has to be propagated\n  \
    \ to all the routers in the default-free zone of the Internet. In\n   contrast,\
    \ when an enterprise uses provider-independent addresses,\n   only some (but not\
    \ all) of the routers in the default-free zone would\n   see changes in routing\
    \ when the enterprise loses its connectivity\n   through one of its ISPs.\n  \
    \ To supress excessive routing load due to link flapping the auto\n   injected\
    \ route has to be advertised until the connectivity via the\n   other connection\
    \ (that was previously down and that triggered auto\n   route injection) becomes\
    \ stable.\n   Use of the non-direct EBGP approach (as described in Section 5.2)\n\
    \   allows to eliminate route flapping due to multi-homed enterprises in\n   the\
    \ default-free zone of the Internet. That is the non-direct EBGP\n   approach\
    \ has better properties with respect to routing stability than\n   the use of\
    \ provider-independent addresses (as described in Section\n   6.1).\n"

  - "8. Applications to multi-homed ISPs\n   The approach described in this document\
    \ could be applicable to a\n   small to medium size ISP that is connected to several\
    \ upstream ISPs.\n   The ISP would acquire blocks of addresses (address prefixes)\
    \ from its\n   upstream ISPs, and would use these addresses for allocations to\
    \ its\n   customers.  Either auto route injection, or the non-direct EBGP\n  \
    \ approach, or a combination of both could be used by the ISP when\n   peering\
    \ with its upstream ISPs. Doing this would provide routability\n   for the customers\
    \ of such ISP, without advertsely affecting the\n   overall scalability of the\
    \ Internet routing system.\n"

  - "9. Security Considerations\n   Since the non-direct EBGP approach (as described\
    \ in Section 5.2)\n   requires EBGP sessions between routers that are more than\
    \ one IP hop\n   from each other, routers that maintain these sessions should\
    \ use an\n   appropriate authentication mechanism(s) for BGP peer authentication.\n\
    \   Security issues related to the IBGP peering, as well as the EBGP\n   peering\
    \ between routers that are one IP hop from each other are\n   outside the scope\
    \ of this document.\n"
