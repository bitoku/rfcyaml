  - "1.  Introduction\n   The media lines in an SDP [3] session may be associated\
    \ with each\n   other in various ways.  SDP itself does not provide methods to\
    \ convey\n   the relationships between the media lines.  Such relationships are\n\
    \   indicated by the extension to SDP as defined in \"Grouping of Media\n   Lines\
    \ in the Session Description Protocol\" (RFC 3388) [2].  RFC 3388\n   defines\
    \ two types of semantics: Lip Synchronization and Flow\n   Identification.\n \
    \  Forward Error Correction (FEC) is a common technique to achieve\n   robust\
    \ communication in error-prone environments.  In this document,\n   we define\
    \ the semantics that allows for grouping of FEC streams with\n   the protected\
    \ payload streams in SDP by further extending RFC 3388.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Forward Error Correction (FEC)\n   Forward Error Correction (FEC) is a common\
    \ technique to achieve\n   robust communication in error-prone environments. \
    \ In FEC,\n   communication uses a bandwidth that is more than payload to send\n\
    \   redundantly coded payload information.  The receivers can readily\n   recover\
    \ the original payload even when some communication is lost in\n   the transmission.\
    \  Compared to other error correction techniques\n   (such as retransmission),\
    \ FEC can achieve much lower transmission\n   delay, and it does not have the\
    \ problem of implosion from\n   retransmission requests in various multicast scenarios.\n\
    \   In general, the FEC data can be sent in two different ways: (1)\n   multiplexed\
    \ together with the original payload stream or (2) as a\n   separate stream. \
    \ It is thus necessary to define mechanisms to\n   indicate the association relationship\
    \ between the FEC data and the\n   payload data they protect.\n   When FEC data\
    \ are multiplexed with the original payload stream, the\n   association relationship\
    \ may, for example, be indicated as specified\n   in \"An RTP Payload for Redundant\
    \ Audio Data\" (RFC 2198) [4].  The\n   generic RTP payload format for FEC [5]\
    \ uses that method.\n   When FEC data are sent as a separate stream from the payload\
    \ data,\n   the association relationship can be indicated in various ways.  This\n\
    \   document on the FEC media line grouping specifies a mechanism for\n   indicating\
    \ such relationships.\n"

- title: 4.1.  FEC Group
  contents:
  - "4.1.  FEC Group\n   Each \"a=group\" line is used to indicate an association\
    \ relationship\n   between the FEC streams and the payload streams.  The streams\n\
    \   included in one \"a=group\" line are called a \"FEC Group\".\n   Each FEC\
    \ group MAY have one or more than one FEC stream, and one or\n   more than one\
    \ payload stream.  For example, it is possible to have\n   one payload stream\
    \ protected by more than one FEC stream , or\n   multiple payload streams sharing\
    \ one FEC stream.\n   Grouping streams in a FEC group only indicates the association\n\
    \   relationship between streams.  The detailed FEC protection\n   scheme/parameters\
    \ are conveyed through the mechanism of the\n   particular FEC algorithm used.\
    \  For example, the FEC grouping is used\n   for generic RTP payload for FEC [5]\
    \ to indicate the association\n   relationship between the FEC stream and the\
    \ payload stream.  The\n   detailed protection level and length information for\
    \ the Unequal Loss\n   Protection (ULP) algorithm is communicated in band within\
    \ the FEC\n   stream.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Offer / Answer Consideration
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Offer / Answer Consideration\n   The backward compatibility in offer /\
    \ answer is generally handled as\n   specified in RFC 3388 [2].\n   Depending\
    \ on the implementation, a node that does not understand FEC\n   grouping (either\
    \ does not understand line grouping at all, or just\n   does not understand the\
    \ FEC semantics) SHOULD respond to an offer\n   containing FEC grouping either\
    \ (1) with an answer that ignores the\n   grouping attribute or (2) with a refusal\
    \ to the request (e.g., 488\n   Not acceptable here or 606 Not acceptable in SIP).\n\
    \   In the first case, the original sender of the offer MUST establish\n   the\
    \ connection without FEC.  In the second case, if the sender of the\n   offer\
    \ still wishes to establish the session, it SHOULD re-try the\n   request with\
    \ an offer without FEC.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Example of FEC Grouping
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Example of FEC Grouping\n   The following example shows a session description\
    \ of a multicast\n   conference.  The first media stream (mid:1) contains the\
    \ audio\n   stream.  The second media stream (mid:2) contains the Generic FEC\
    \ [5]\n   protection for the audio stream.  These two streams form an FEC\n  \
    \ group.  The relationship between the two streams is indicated by the\n   \"\
    a=group:FEC 1 2\" line.  The FEC stream is sent to the same multicast\n   group\
    \ and has the same Time to Live (TTL) as the audio, but on a port\n   number two\
    \ higher.  Likewise, the video stream (mid:3) and its\n   Generic FEC protection\
    \ stream (mid:4) form another FEC group.  The\n   relationship between the two\
    \ streams is indicated by the \"a=group:FEC\n   3 4\" line.  The FEC stream is\
    \ sent to a different multicast address,\n   but has the same port number (30004)\

- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   There is a weak threat for the receiver that\
    \ the FEC grouping can be\n   modified to indicate FEC relationships that do not\
    \ exist.  Such\n   attacks may result in failure of FEC to protect, and/or mishandling\n\
    \   of other media payload streams.  It is recommended that the receiver\n   SHOULD\
    \ do integrity check on SDP and follow the security\n   considerations of SDP\
    \ [3] to only trust SDP from trusted sources.\n"
