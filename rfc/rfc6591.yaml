  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Abuse Reporting Format [ARF] defines a message format
    for sending\n   reports of abuse in the messaging infrastructure, with an eye
    towards\n   automating both the generation and consumption of those reports.\n
    \  There is now also a desire to extend the ARF to include the reporting\n   of
    messages that fail to authenticate using known message\n   authentication methods,
    such as DomainKeys Identified Mail [DKIM] and\n   Sender Policy Framework [SPF],
    as these are sometimes evidence of\n   abuse that can be detected and reported
    through automated means.  The\n   same mechanism can be used to convey forensic
    information about the\n   specific reason the authentication method failed.  Thus,
    this memo\n   presents such extensions to ARF that allow for detailed reporting
    of\n   message authentication method failures.\n"

    - "3.1.  New ARF Feedback Type\n   A new feedback type, \"auth-failure\", is defined
      in this document as\n   an extension, per Section 7.3 of [ARF].\n   A message
      that uses this feedback type has the following modified\n   header field requirements
      for the second (machine-parseable) [MIME]\n   part of the report:\n   Authentication-Results:
      \ Syntax as specified in [AUTH-RESULTS].\n      Furthermore, [ARF] specifies
      this field is OPTIONAL and appears at\n      most once; for this extension,
      this field MUST be present, but it\n      MUST reflect only a single authentication
      method's result.\n   Original-Envelope-Id:  Syntax as specified in [ARF].  Furthermore,\n
      \     [ARF] specifies this field is OPTIONAL and appears at most once;\n      for
      this extension, this field's inclusion is RECOMMENDED, where\n      that value
      is available, to aid in diagnosing the authentication\n      failure.\n   Original-Mail-From:
      \ Syntax as specified in [ARF].  Furthermore,\n      [ARF] specifies this field
      is OPTIONAL and appears at most once;\n      for this extension, this field's
      inclusion is RECOMMENDED, where\n      that value is available, to aid in diagnosing
      the authentication\n      failure.\n   Source-IP:  Syntax as specified in [ARF].
      \ Furthermore, [ARF]\n      specifies this field is OPTIONAL and appears at
      most once; for\n      this extension, this field's inclusion is RECOMMENDED,
      where that\n      value is available, to aid in diagnosing the authentication\n
      \     failure.\n   Reported-Domain:  Syntax as specified in [ARF].  Furthermore,
      [ARF]\n      specifies this field is OPTIONAL and appears at most once; for\n
      \     this extension, this field MUST be present if such a value is\n      available.\n
      \  Delivery-Result:  As specified in Section 3.2.2.  This field is\n      OPTIONAL,
      but it MUST NOT appear more than once.  If present, it\n      SHOULD indicate
      the outcome of the message in some meaningful way,\n      but it MAY be set
      to \"other\" for local policy reasons.\n   The third MIME part of the message
      is either of type \"message/rfc822\"\n   (as defined in [MIME-TYPES]) or of
      type \"text/rfc822-headers\" (as\n   defined in [REPORT]) and contains a copy
      of the entire header block\n   from the original message.  This part MUST be
      included (contrary to\n   [REPORT], which makes it optional).\n   For privacy
      reasons, report generators might need to redact portions\n   of a reported message,
      such as an identifier or address associated\n   with the end user whose complaint
      action resulted in the report.  A\n   discussion of relevant issues and a suggested
      method for doing so can\n   be found in [RFC6590].\n"

      precautions to minimize the potential damage from denial-\n   of-service attacks.\n
      \  Security threats related to forged DSNs include the sending of\n   a.  A
      falsified email authentication method failure notification when\n       the
      message was in fact delivered to the indicated recipient;\n   b.  Falsified
      signature information, such as selector, domain, etc.\n   Perhaps the simplest
      means of mitigating this threat is to assert\n   that these reports should themselves
      be signed with something like\n   DKIM.  On the other hand, if there's a problem
      with the DKIM\n   infrastructure at the verifier, signing DKIM failure reports
      might\n   produce reports that aren't trusted or even accepted by their\n   intended
      recipients.\n"

    - "6.3.  Automatic Generation\n   Automatic generation of these reports by verifying
      agents can cause a\n   denial-of-service attack when a large volume of email
      is sent that\n   causes email authentication failures for whatever reason.\n
      \  Limiting the rate of generation of these messages might be\n   appropriate
      but threatens to inhibit the distribution of important\n   and possibly time-sensitive
      information.\n   In general ARF feedback loop terms, it is suggested that report\n
      \  generators only create these (or any) ARF reports after an out-of-\n   band
      arrangement has been made between two parties.  This mechanism\n   then becomes
      a way to adjust parameters of an authorized abuse report\n   feedback loop that
      is configured and activated by private agreement\n   rather than starting to
      send them automatically based solely on\n   discovered data in the DNS.\n"

    - "6.4.  Envelope Sender Selection\n   In the case of transmitted reports in the
      form of a new message, it\n   is necessary to consider the construction and
      transmission of the\n   message so as to avoid amplification attacks, deliberate
      or\n   otherwise.  See Section 5 of [ARF] for further information.\n"
    title: 6.4.  Envelope Sender Selection
  - contents:
    - "6.5.  Reporting Multiple Incidents\n   If it is known that a particular host
      generates abuse reports upon\n   certain incidents, an attacker could forge
      a high volume of messages\n   that will trigger such a report.  The recipient
      of the report could\n   then be inundated with reports.  This could easily be
      extended to a\n   distributed denial-of-service attack by finding a number of
      report-\n   generating servers.\n   The incident count referenced in [ARF] provides
      a limited form of\n   mitigation.  The host generating reports may elect to
      send reports\n   only periodically, with each report representing a number of\n
      \  identical or near-identical incidents.  One might even do something\n   inverse-exponentially,
      sending reports for each of the first ten\n   incidents, then every tenth incident
      up to 100, then every 100th\n   incident up to 1000, etc., until some period
      of relative quiet after\n   which the limitation resets.\n   The use of this
      technique for \"near-identical\" incidents in\n   particular causes a degradation
      in reporting quality, however.  If,\n   for example, a large number of pieces
      of spam arrive from one\n   attacker, a reporting agent might decide only to
      send a report about\n   a fraction of those messages.  While this averts a flood
      of reports\n   to a system administrator, the precise details of each incident
      are\n   similarly not sent.\n"

    - "6.6.  Redaction of Data in DKIM Reports\n   This memo requires that the canonicalized
      header and body be returned\n   without being subject to redaction when a DKIM
      failure is being\n   reported.  This is necessary to ensure that the returned\n
      \  canonicalized forms are useful for debugging, as they must be\n   compared
      to the equivalent form at the signer.  If a message is\n   altered in transit,
      and the returned data are also redacted, the\n   redacted portion and the altered
      portion may overlap, rendering the\n   comparison results meaningless.  However,
      unredacted data can leak\n   information the reporting entity considers to be
      private.  It is for\n   this reason the return of the canonicalized forms is
      not required.\n"
