- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   RFC 2119 defines a standard set of key words for describing\n  \
    \ requirements of a specification.  Many IETF documents have found that\n   these\
    \ words cannot accurately capture the nuanced requirements of\n   their specification.\
    \  This document defines additional key words that\n   can be used to address\
    \ alternative requirements scenarios.  Authors\n   who follow these guidelines\
    \ should incorporate this phrase near the\n   beginning of their document:\n \
    \  The key words \"MUST (BUT WE KNOW YOU WON'T)\", \"SHOULD CONSIDER\",\n   \"\
    REALLY SHOULD NOT\", \"OUGHT TO\", \"WOULD PROBABLY\", \"MAY WISH TO\",\n   \"\
    COULD\", \"POSSIBLE\", and \"MIGHT\" in this document are to be\n   interpreted\
    \ as described in RFC 6919.\n"

- title: 1.  MUST (BUT WE KNOW YOU WON'T)
  contents:
  - "1.  MUST (BUT WE KNOW YOU WON'T)\n   The phrase \"MUST (BUT WE KNOW YOU WON'T)\"\
    \ is used to indicate\n   requirements that are needed to meet formal review criteria\
    \ (e.g.,\n   mandatory-to-implement security mechanisms), when these mechanisms\n\
    \   are too inconvenient for implementers to actually implement.\n   This phrase\
    \ is frequently used in a contracted form in which the\n   parenthetical is omitted.\
    \  The parenthetical may also be moved later\n   in the sentence for stylistic\
    \ reasons.  If the parenthetical is\n   present, authors MUST provide a reason\
    \ why they know implementors\n   will not heed this instruction in the parenthetical,\
    \ as in the\n   example (BUT WE KNOW YOU WON'T).  In the below example, we show\
    \ a\n   case from RFC 6120 where the original text omitted the parenthetical,\n\
    \   and we have indicated an appropriate parenthetical.\n   For example: \"For\
    \ authentication only, servers and clients MUST\n   support the SASL Salted Challenge\
    \ Response Authentication Mechanism\n   [SCRAM] -- in particular, the SCRAM-SHA-1\
    \ and SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS\n   variants [(BUT WE KNOW YOU WON'T, because your TLS\
    \ library doesn't\n   support extracting channel binding information)].\"  [RFC6120]\n"
- title: 2.  SHOULD CONSIDER
  contents:
  - "2.  SHOULD CONSIDER\n   The phrase \"SHOULD CONSIDER\" indicates that the authors\
    \ of the\n   specification think that implementations should do something, but\n\
    \   they're not sure quite what.\n   For example: \"Applications that take advantage\
    \ of typed links should\n   consider the attack vectors opened by automatically\
    \ following,\n   trusting, or otherwise using links gathered from HTTP headers.\"\
    \n   [RFC5988]\n"
- title: 3.  REALLY SHOULD NOT
  contents:
  - "3.  REALLY SHOULD NOT\n   The phrase \"REALLY SHOULD NOT\" is used to indicate\
    \ dangerous\n   behaviors that some important vendor still does and therefore\
    \ we were\n   unable to make MUST NOT.\n   For example: \"This command really\
    \ should not be used\" [RFC0493]\n"
- title: 4.  OUGHT TO
  contents:
  - "4.  OUGHT TO\n   The phrase \"OUGHT TO\" conveys an optimistic assertion of an\n\
    \   implementation behavior that is clearly morally right, and thus does\n   not\
    \ require substantiation.\n   For example: \"If a decision might affect semantic\
    \ transparency, the\n   implementor ought to err on the side of maintaining transparency\n\
    \   unless a careful and complete analysis shows significant benefits in\n   breaking\
    \ transparency.\"  [RFC2616]\n"
- title: 5.  WOULD PROBABLY
  contents:
  - "5.  WOULD PROBABLY\n   The phrase \"WOULD PROBABLY\" indicates the authors expectation\
    \ about\n   what a reasonable implementation is likely to do in a given case.\n\
    \   There is no requirement for implementations to be reasonable.\n   This phrase\
    \ is also a good example of an aspect of English grammar\n   that is often useful\
    \ in specification writing, namely the passive-\n   aggressive voice, which provides\
    \ a meaning in between the active and\n   the passive voice.\n   For example:\
    \ \"A SMTP client would probably only want to authenticate\n   an SMTP server\
    \ whose server certificate has a domain name that is the\n   domain name that\
    \ the client thought it was connecting to.\"  [RFC3207]\n"
- title: 6.  MAY WISH TO
  contents:
  - "6.  MAY WISH TO\n   The phrase \"MAY WISH TO\" indicates a behavior that might\
    \ seem\n   appealing to some people, but which is regarded as ridiculous or\n\
    \   unnecessary by others.  This phrase is frequently used to avoid\n   further\
    \ delay in approval of a document.\n   For example: \"Verifiers MAY wish to track\
    \ testing mode results to\n   assist the Signer.\"  [RFC6376]\n"
- title: 7.  COULD
  contents:
  - "7.  COULD\n   The phrase \"COULD\" provides a way for specification authors to\n\
    \   articulate existential possibilities, in order to provide a hint that\n  \
    \ might be critical to reliable or secure operation, but without a hard\n   requirement.\
    \  The lack of a requirement allows for vendor product\n   differentiation.\n\
    \   For example: \"An implementation could mitigate this race condition,\n   for\
    \ example, using timers.\"  [RFC6733]\n"
- title: 8.  POSSIBLE
  contents:
  - "8.  POSSIBLE\n   The phrase \"POSSIBLE\" describes what some of the working group\n\
    \   members thought of as an edge case that will never happen, but in\n   practice\
    \ allows the protocol to work at the most fundamental level.\n   For example:\
    \ \"It is also possible for the server to send a completion\n   response for some\
    \ other command (if multiple commands are in\n   progress), or untagged data.\"\
    \  [RFC3501]\n"
- title: 9.  MIGHT
  contents:
  - "9.  MIGHT\n   The phrase \"MIGHT\" conveys a requirement in an intentionally\
    \ stealthy\n   fashion, to facilitate product differentiation (cf. \"COULD\" above).\n\
    \   For example: \"In the case of audio and different \"m\" lines for\n   different\
    \ codecs, an implementation might decide to act as a mixer\n   with the different\
    \ incoming RTP sessions, which is the correct\n   behavior.\"  [RFC5888]\n"
- title: 10.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   Traditionally, security requirements in IETF\
    \ documents have been\n   expressed with a mixture of requirements words from\
    \ RFC 2119\n   [RFC2119] and the phrases used above.  The key words in RFC 2119\
    \ are\n   principally useful when threats and mitigations are clear and well\n\
    \   defined.  The key words in this document can be applied when the\n   threat\
    \ model is ambiguous, and mitigations are unclear or\n   inconvenient.\n"
