  - "1.0 Introduction\n   A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a compact string representation\n\
    \   of the location for a resource that is available via the Internet.\n   RFC\
    \ 2396 [1] defines the general syntax and semantics of URIs, and,\n   by inclusion,\
    \ URLs.  URLs are designated by including a \"<scheme>:\"\n   and then a \"<scheme-specific-part>\"\
    .  Many URL schemes are already\n   defined, however, new schemes may need to\
    \ be defined in the future in\n   order to accommodate new Internet protocols\
    \ and/or procedures.\n   A registration process is needed to ensure that the names\
    \ of all such\n   new schemes are guaranteed not to collide.  Further, the registration\n\
    \   process ensures that URL schemes intended for wide spread, public use\n  \
    \ are developed in an orderly, well-specified, and public manner.\n   This document\
    \ defines the registration procedures to be followed when\n   new URL schemes\
    \ are created.  A separate document, RFC 2718,\n   Guidelines for URL Schemes\
    \ [2], provides guidelines for the creation\n   of new URL schemes.  The primary\
    \ focus of this document is on the\n   <scheme> portion of new URL schemes, referred\
    \ to as the \"scheme name\"\n   throughout this document.\n"

  - "2.1 General\n   In order to increase the efficiency and flexibility of the URL\
    \ scheme\n   name registration process, the need is recognized for multiple\n\
    \   registration \"trees\".  The registration requirements and specific\n   registration\
    \ procedures for each tree differ, allowing the overall\n   registration procedure\
    \ to accommodate the different natural\n   requirements for URL schemes.  For\
    \ example, a scheme that will be\n   recommended for wide support and implementation\
    \ by the Internet\n   community requires a more complete review than a scheme\
    \ intended to\n   be used for resources associated with proprietary software.\n\
    \   The first step in registering a new URL scheme name is to determine\n   which\
    \ registration tree the scheme should be registered in.\n   Determination of the\
    \ proper registration tree is based on the\n   intended use for the new scheme\
    \ and the desired syntax for the scheme\n   name.\n   This document will discuss\
    \ in detail the tree that reflects current\n   practice, under IETF ownership\
    \ and control.  It will also set forth\n   an outline to assist authors in creating\
    \ new trees to address\n   differing needs for wide acceptance and interoperability,\
    \ ease of\n   creation and use, and type and \"strength\" of ownership.\n"
- title: 2.2 The IETF Tree
  contents:
  - "2.2 The IETF Tree\n   The IETF tree is intended for URL schemes of general interest\
    \ to the\n   Internet community.  The tree exists for URL schemes that require\
    \ a\n   substantive review and approval process.  It is expected that\n   applicability\
    \ statements for particular applications will be\n   published from time to time\
    \ that recommend implementation of, and\n   support for, URL schemes that have\
    \ proven particularly useful in\n   those contexts.\n"
- title: 2.3 Additional Registration Trees
  contents:
  - "2.3 Additional Registration Trees\n   From time to time and as required by the\
    \ community, the IESG may\n   create new top-level registration trees.  These\
    \ trees may require\n   significant, little or no registration, and may allow\
    \ change control\n   to rest in the hands of individuals or groups other than\
    \ IETF.  A new\n   tree should only be created if no existing tree can be shown\
    \ to\n   address the set of needs of some sector of the community.\n"

- title: 3.2 The IETF Tree
  contents:
  - "3.2 The IETF Tree\n   Registration in the IETF tree requires publication of the\
    \ URL scheme\n   syntax and semantics in either an Informational or Standards\
    \ Track\n   RFC. In general, the creation of a new URL scheme requires a\n   Standards\
    \ Track RFC.  An Informational RFC may be employed for\n   registration only in\
    \ the case of a URL scheme which is already in\n   wide usage and meets other\
    \ standards set forth in RFC 2718, such as\n   \"demonstrated utility\" within\
    \ the Internet Architecture; the IESG\n   shall have broad discretion in determining\
    \ whether an Informational\n   RFC is suitable in any given case, and may either\
    \ recommend changes\n   to such document prior to publication, or reject it for\
    \ publication.\n   An Informational RFC purporting to describe a URL scheme shall\
    \ not be\n   published without IESG approval.  This is a departure from practice\n\
    \   for Informational RFCs as set forth in RFC 2026, for the purpose of\n   ensuring\
    \ that the registration of URL schemes shall serve the best\n   interests of the\
    \ Internet community.\n   The NAMES of schemes registered in the IETF tree MUST\
    \ NOT contain the\n   dash (also known as the hyphen and minus sign) character\
    \ ('-')\n   USASCII value 2Dh.  Use of this character can cause confusion with\n\
    \   schemes registered in alternative trees (see section 3.3).\n   An analysis\
    \ of the security issues inherent in the new URL scheme is\n   REQUIRED. (This\
    \ is in accordance with the basic requirements for all\n   IETF protocols.) URL\
    \ schemes registered in the IETF tree should not\n   introduce additional security\
    \ risks into the Internet Architecture.\n   For example, URLs should not embed\
    \ information which should remain\n   confidential, such as passwords, nor should\
    \ new schemes subvert the\n   security of existing schemes or protocols (i.e.\
    \ by layering or\n   tunneling).\n   The \"owner\" of a URL scheme name registered\
    \ in the IETF tree is\n   assumed to be the IETF itself.  Modification or alteration\
    \ of the\n   specification requires the same level of processing (e.g.\n   Informational\
    \ or Standards Track RFC) as used for the initial\n   registration.  Schemes originally\
    \ defined via an Informational RFC\n   may, however, be replaced with Standards\
    \ Track documents.\n"
- title: 3.3  Alternative Trees
  contents:
  - "3.3  Alternative Trees\n   While public exposure and review of a URL scheme created\
    \ in an\n   alternative tree is not required, using the IETF Internet-Draft\n\
    \   mechanism for peer review is strongly encouraged to improve the\n   quality\
    \ of the specification.  RFC publication of alternative tree\n   URL schemes is\
    \ encouraged but not required.  Material may be\n   published as an Informational\
    \ RFC by sending it to the RFC Editor\n   (please follow the instructions to RFC\
    \ authors, RFC 2223 [3]).\n   The defining document for an alternative tree may\
    \ require public\n   exposure and/or review for schemes defined in that tree via\
    \ a\n   mechanism other than the IETF Internet-Draft mechanism.\n   URL schemes\
    \ created in an alternative tree must conform to the\n   generic URL syntax, RFC\
    \ 2396.  The tree's defining document may set\n   forth additional syntax and\
    \ semantics requirements above and beyond\n   those specified in RFC 2396.\n \
    \  All new URL schemes SHOULD follow the Guidelines for URL Schemes, set\n   forth\
    \ in RFC 2718 [2].\n   An analysis of the security issues inherent in the new\
    \ URL scheme is\n   encouraged.  Regardless of what security analysis is or is\
    \ not\n   performed, all descriptions of security issues must be as accurate as\n\
    \   possible.  In particular, a statement that there are \"no security\n   issues\
    \ associated with this scheme\" must not be confused with \"the\n   security issues\
    \ associates with this scheme have not been assessed\"\n   or \"the security issues\
    \ associated with this scheme cannot be\n   predicted because of <reason>\".\n\
    \   There is absolutely no requirement that URL schemes created in an\n   alternative\
    \ tree be secure or completely free from risks.\n   Nevertheless, the tree's defining\
    \ document must set forth the\n   standard for security considerations, and in\
    \ any event all known\n   security risks SHOULD be identified.\n   Change control\
    \ must be defined for a new tree.  Change control may be\n   vested in the IETF,\
    \ or in an individual, group or other entity.  The\n   change control standard\
    \ for the tree must be approved by the IESG.\n   The syntax for alternative trees\
    \ shall be as follows: each tree will\n   be identified by a unique prefix, which\
    \ must be established in the\n   same fashion as a URL scheme name in the IETF\
    \ tree, except that the\n   prefix must be defined by a Standards Track document.\
    \  Scheme names\n   in the new tree are then constructed by prepending the prefix\
    \ to an\n   identifier unique to each scheme in that tree, as prescribed by that\n\
    \   tree's identifying document:\n      <prefix>'-'<tree-specific identifier>\n\
    \   For instance, the \"foo\" tree would allow creation of scheme names of\n \
    \  the form: \"foo-blahblah:\" and \"foo-bar:\", where the tree prescribes\n \
    \  an arbitrary USASCII string following the tree's unique prefix.\n"

    \ After all issues raised during a review period of no less than 4\n   weeks have\

    \ the proposed new scheme and either refer the\n   scheme to a working group (existing\
    \ or new) or directly present the\n   scheme to the IESG for a last call.  In\

    \ mechanism; or nonexistent.  The registration mechanism\n   must be documented\
    \ for each alternative tree, and must be consistent\n   for all URL scheme names\
    \ created in that tree.\n   It is the responsibility of the creator of the tree's\
    \ registration\n   requirements to establish that the registration mechanism is\
    \ workable\n   as described; it is within the discretion of the IESG to reject\
    \ the\n   document describing a tree if it determines the registration\n   mechanism\
    \ is impractical or creates an undue burden on a party who\n   will not accept\
    \ it.  (For instance, if an IANA registration mechanism\n   is proposed, IESG\
    \ might reject the tree if its mechanism would create\n   undue liability on the\
    \ part of IANA.)\n   While the template in section 6 of this document is intended\
