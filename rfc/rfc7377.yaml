  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IMAP4 specification allows the searching of only the
    selected\n   mailbox.  A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and a\n
    \  client that wishes to support this must issue a series of SELECT and\n   SEARCH
    commands, waiting for each to complete before moving on to the\n   next.  The
    commands can't be pipelined, because the server might run\n   them in parallel
    and the untagged SEARCH responses could not then be\n   distinguished from each
    other.\n   This extension allows a client to search multiple mailboxes with one\n
    \  command and includes MAILBOX and TAG fields in the ESEARCH response,\n   yielding
    the following advantages:\n   o  A single command limits the number of round trips
    needed to search\n      a set of mailboxes.\n   o  A single command eliminates
    the need to wait for one search to\n      complete before starting the next.\n
    \  o  A single command allows the server to optimize the search if it\n      can.\n
    \  o  A command that is not dependent upon the selected mailbox\n      eliminates
    the need to disrupt the selection state or to open\n      another IMAP connection.\n
    \  o  The MAILBOX, UIDVALIDITY, and TAG fields in the responses allow a\n      client
    to distinguish which responses go with which search (and\n      which mailbox).
    \ A client can safely pipeline these search\n      commands without danger of
    confusion.  The addition of the MAILBOX\n      and UIDVALIDITY fields updates
    the search-correlator item defined\n      in [RFC4466].\n   This extension was
    previously published in an Experimental RFC.\n   There is now implementation experience,
    giving confidence in the\n   protocol, so this document puts the extension on
    the Standards Track,\n   with some minor updates that were informed by the implementation\n
    \  experience.  A brief summary of changes is in Section 7.\n"

  - "2.  New ESEARCH Command\n   Arguments:  OPTIONAL source options\n               OPTIONAL
    result options\n               OPTIONAL charset specification (see [RFC2978])\n
    \              searching criteria (one or more)\n   Responses:  REQUIRED untagged
    response: ESEARCH\n   Result:     OK -- search completed\n               NO --
    error: cannot search that charset or criteria\n               BAD -- command unknown
    or arguments invalid\n   This section defines a new ESEARCH command, which works
    similarly to\n   the UID SEARCH command described in Section 2.6.1 of [RFC4466]\n
    \  (initially described in Section 6.4.4 of [RFC3501] and extended by\n   [RFC4731]).\n
    \  The ESEARCH command further extends searching by allowing for\n   optional
    source and result options.  This document does not define\n   any new result options
    (see Section 3.1 of [RFC4731]).  A server that\n   supports this extension includes
    \"MULTISEARCH\" in its IMAP capability\n   string.\n   Because there has been
    confusion about this, it is worth pointing out\n   that with ESEARCH, as with
    any SEARCH or UID SEARCH command, it MUST\n   NOT be considered an error if the
    search terms include a range of\n   message numbers that extends (or, in fact,
    starts) beyond the end of\n   the mailbox.  For example, a client might want to
    establish a rolling\n   window through the search results this way:\n   C: tag1
    UID ESEARCH FROM \"frobozz\" 1:100\n   ... followed later by this:\n   C: tag1
    UID ESEARCH FROM \"frobozz\" 101:200\n   ... and so on.\n   This tells the server
    to match only the first hundred messages in the\n   mailbox the first time, the
    second hundred the second time, etc.  In\n   fact, it might likely allow the server
    to optimize the search\n   significantly.  In the above example, whether the mailbox
    contains\n   50, 150, or 250 messages, neither of the search commands shown will\n
    \  result in an error.  It is up to the client to know when to stop\n   moving
    its search window.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  The ESEARCH Response\n   In response to an ESEARCH command, the server
      MUST return ESEARCH\n   responses [RFC4731] (that is, not SEARCH responses).
      \ Because message\n   numbers are not useful for mailboxes that are not selected,
      the\n   responses MUST contain information about UIDs, not message numbers.\n
      \  This is true even if the source options specify that only the\n   selected
      mailbox be searched.\n   Presence of a source option in the absence of a result
      option implies\n   the \"ALL\" result option (see Section 3.1 of [RFC4731]).
      \ Note that\n   this is not the same as the result from the SEARCH command described\n
      \  in the IMAP base protocol [RFC3501].\n   Source options describe which mailboxes
      must be searched for\n   messages.  An ESEARCH command with source options does
      not affect\n   which mailbox, if any, is currently selected, regardless of which\n
      \  mailboxes are searched.\n   For each mailbox satisfying the source options,
      a single ESEARCH\n   response MUST be returned if any messages in that mailbox
      match the\n   search criteria.  An ESEARCH response MUST NOT be returned for\n
      \  mailboxes that contain no matching messages.  This is true even when\n   result
      options such as MIN, MAX, and COUNT are specified (see\n   Section 3.1 of [RFC4731]),
      and the values returned (lowest UID\n   matched, highest UID matched, and number
      of messages matched,\n   respectively) apply to the mailbox reported in that
      ESEARCH response.\n   Note that it is possible for an ESEARCH command to return
      no untagged\n   responses (no ESEARCH responses at all) in the case that there
      are no\n   matches to the search in any of the mailboxes that satisfy the source\n
      \  options.  Clients can detect this situation by finding the tagged OK\n   response
      without having received any matching untagged ESEARCH\n   responses.\n   Each
      ESEARCH response MUST contain the MAILBOX, TAG, and UIDVALIDITY\n   correlators.
      \ Correlators allow clients to issue several ESEARCH\n   commands at once (pipelined).
      \ If the SEARCHRES [RFC5182] extension\n   is used in an ESEARCH command, that
      ESEARCH command MUST be executed\n   by the server after all previous SEARCH/ESEARCH
      commands have\n   completed and before any subsequent SEARCH/ESEARCH commands
      are\n   executed.  The server MAY perform consecutive ESEARCH commands in\n
      \  parallel as long as none of them use the SEARCHRES extension.\n"
    title: 2.1.  The ESEARCH Response
  - contents:
    - "2.2.  Source Options: Specifying Mailboxes to Search\n   The source options,
      if present, MUST contain a mailbox specifier as\n   defined in the IMAP NOTIFY
      extension [RFC5465], Section 6 (using the\n   \"filter-mailboxes\" ABNF item),
      with the following differences:\n   1.  The \"selected-delayed\" specifier is
      not valid here.\n   2.  A \"subtree-one\" specifier is added.  The \"subtree\"
      specifier\n       results in a search of the specified mailbox and all selectable\n
      \      mailboxes that are subordinate to it, through an indefinitely\n       deep
      hierarchy.  The \"subtree-one\" specifier results in a search\n       of the
      specified mailbox and all selectable child mailboxes, one\n       hierarchy
      level down.\n   If \"subtree\" is specified, the server MUST defend against
      loops in\n   the hierarchy (for example, those caused by recursive file-system\n
      \  links within the message store).  The server SHOULD do this by\n   keeping
      track of the mailboxes that have been searched and by\n   terminating the hierarchy
      traversal when a repeat is found.  If it\n   cannot do that, it MAY do it by
      limiting the hierarchy depth.\n   If the source options are not present, the
      value \"selected\" is\n   assumed -- that is, only the currently selected mailbox
      is searched.\n   The \"personal\" source option is a particularly convenient
      way to\n   search all of the current user's mailboxes.  Note that there is no\n
      \  way to use wildcard characters to search all mailboxes; the\n   \"mailboxes\"
      source option does not do wildcard expansion.\n   If the source options include
      (or default to) \"selected\", the IMAP\n   session MUST be in \"selected\" state.
      \ If the source options specify\n   other mailboxes and NOT \"selected\", then
      the IMAP session MUST be in\n   either \"selected\" or \"authenticated\" state.
      \ If the session is not in\n   a correct state, the ESEARCH command MUST return
      a \"BAD\" result.\n   The client SHOULD NOT provide source options that resolve
      to\n   including the same mailbox more than once.  A server can, of course,\n
      \  remove the duplicates before processing, but the server MAY return\n   \"BAD\"
      to an ESEARCH command with duplicate source mailboxes.\n   If the server supports
      the SEARCHRES [RFC5182] extension, then the\n   \"SAVE\" result option is valid
      only if \"selected\" is specified or\n   defaulted to as the sole mailbox to
      be searched.  If any source\n   option other than \"selected\" is specified,
      the ESEARCH command MUST\n   return a \"BAD\" result.\n   If the server supports
      the CONTEXT=SEARCH and/or CONTEXT=SORT\n   extension [RFC5267], then the following
      additional rules apply:\n   o  The CONTEXT return option (Section 4.2 of [RFC5267])
      can be used\n      with an ESEARCH command.\n   o  If the UPDATE return option
      is used (Section 4.3 of [RFC5267]), it\n      MUST apply only to the currently
      selected mailbox.  If UPDATE is\n      used and there is no mailbox currently
      selected, the ESEARCH\n      command MUST return a \"BAD\" result.\n   o  The
      PARTIAL search return option (Section 4.4 of [RFC5267]) can be\n      used and
      applies to each mailbox searched by the ESEARCH command.\n   If the server supports
      the Access Control List (ACL) [RFC4314]\n   extension, then the logged-in user
      is required to have the \"r\" right\n   for each mailbox she wants to search.
      \ In addition, any mailboxes\n   that are not explicitly named (accessed through
      \"personal\" or\n   \"subtree\", for example) are required to have the \"l\"
      right.\n   Mailboxes matching the source options for which the logged-in user\n
      \  lacks sufficient rights MUST be ignored by the ESEARCH command\n   processing.
      \ In particular, ESEARCH responses MUST NOT be returned\n   for those mailboxes.\n"

    - "2.3.  Strictness in Search Matches\n   The base IMAP SEARCH command (Section
      6.4.4. of [RFC3501]) requires\n   strict substring matching in text searches.
      \ Many servers, however,\n   use search engines that match strings in different
      ways, for example,\n   matching \"swim\" to both \"swam\" and \"swum\" or only
      doing full word\n   matching (where \"swim\" will not match \"swimming\").  This
      is covered\n   by the \"Fuzzy Search\" extension to IMAP [RFC6203], and that
      extension\n   is compatible with this one and can be combined with it.\n   Whether
      or not Fuzzy Search is implemented or used, this extension\n   explicitly allows
      flexible searching with respect to TEXT and BODY\n   searches.  Servers MAY
      use fuzzy text matching in multimailbox\n   searches.\n"

    - "2.4.  Server-Side Limitations on Search Volume\n   To avoid having a search
      use more than a reasonable share of server\n   resources, servers MAY apply
      limits that go beyond loop protection,\n   such as limits on the number of mailboxes
      that may be searched at\n   once and/or limits on the number or total size of
      messages searched.\n   A server can apply those limits up front, responding
      with \"NO\n   [LIMIT]\" if a limit is exceeded (see [RFC5530] for information
      about\n   response codes).  Alternatively, a server can process the search and\n
      \  terminate it when a limit is exceeded, responding with \"OK [LIMIT]\"\n   and
      returning partial results.  Note that searches that return\n   partial results
      can cause complexity for client implementations and\n   confusion to users.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This new IMAP ESEARCH command allows a single
    command to search many\n   mailboxes at once.  On the one hand, a client could
    do that by\n   sending many IMAP SEARCH commands.  On the other hand, this makes
    it\n   easier for a client to overwork a server by sending a single command\n
    \  that results in an expensive search of tens of thousands of\n   mailboxes.
    \ Server implementations need to be aware of that and\n   provide mechanisms that
    prevent a client from adversely affecting\n   other users.  Limitations on the
    number of mailboxes that may be\n   searched in one command and/or on the server
    resources that will be\n   devoted to responding to a single client, are reasonable
    limitations\n   for an implementation to impose (see also Section 2.4).\n   Implementations
    MUST, of course, apply access controls appropriately,\n   limiting a user's access
    to ESEARCH in the same way its access is\n   limited for any other IMAP commands.
    \ This extension has no data-\n   access risks beyond what may exist in the unextended
    IMAP\n   implementation.\n   Mailboxes matching the source options for which the
    logged-in user\n   lacks sufficient rights MUST be ignored by the ESEARCH command\n
    \  processing (see the paragraph about this in Section 2.2).  In\n   particular,
    any attempt to distinguish insufficient access from non-\n   existent mailboxes
    may expose information about the mailbox hierarchy\n   that isn't otherwise available
    to the client.\n   If \"subtree\" is specified, the server MUST defend against
    loops in\n   the hierarchy (see the paragraph about this in Section 2.2).\n"
