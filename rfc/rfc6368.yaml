  - "1.  Introduction\n   In current deployments, when BGP is used as the Provider/Customer\n\
    \   Edge routing protocol, these peering sessions are typically\n   configured\
    \ as an external peering between the VPN provider autonomous\n   system (AS) and\
    \ the customer network autonomous system.  At each\n   External BGP boundary,\
    \ BGP path attributes [RFC4271] are modified as\n   per standard BGP rules.  This\
    \ includes prepending the AS_PATH\n   attribute with the autonomous-system number\
    \ of the originating\n   Customer Edge (CE) router and the autonomous-system number(s)\
    \ of the\n   Provider Edge (PE) router(s).\n   In order for such routes not to\
    \ be rejected by AS_PATH loop\n   detection, a PE router advertising a route received\
    \ from a remote PE\n   often remaps the customer network autonomous-system number\
    \ to its\n   own.  Otherwise, the customer network can use different autonomous-\n\
    \   system numbers at different sites or configure their CE routers to\n   accept\
    \ routes containing their own AS number.\n   While this technique works well in\
    \ situations where there are no BGP\n   routing exchanges between the client network\
    \ and other networks, it\n   does have drawbacks for customer networks that use\
    \ BGP internally for\n   purposes other than interaction between CE and PE routers.\n\
    \   In order to make the usage of BGP/MPLS VPN services as transparent as\n  \
    \ possible to any external interaction, it is desirable to define a\n   mechanism\
    \ by which PE-CE routers can exchange BGP routes by means\n   other than External\
    \ BGP.\n   One can consider a BGP/MPLS VPN as a provider-managed backbone\n  \
    \ service interconnecting several customer-managed sites.  While this\n   model\
    \ is not universal, it does constitute a good starting point.\n   Independently\
    \ of the presence of VPN service, networks often use a\n   hierarchical design\
    \ utilizing either BGP route reflection [RFC4456]\n   or confederations [RFC5065].\
    \  This document assumes that the IP VPN\n   service interacts with the customer\
    \ network following a similar\n   model.\n"

- title: 3.  IP VPN as a Route Server
  contents:
  - "3.  IP VPN as a Route Server\n   In a typical backbone/area hierarchical design,\
    \ routers that attach\n   an area (or site) to the core use BGP route reflection\
    \ (or\n   confederations) to distribute routes between the top-level core\n  \
    \ Internal BGP (iBGP) mesh and the local area iBGP cluster.\n   To provide equivalent\
    \ functionality in a network using a provider-\n   provisioned backbone, one can\
    \ consider the VPN as the equivalent of\n   an Internal BGP Route Server that\
    \ multiplexes information from _N_\n   VPN attachment points.\n   A route learned\
    \ by any of the PEs in the IP VPN is available to all\n   other PEs that import\
    \ the Route Target used to identify the customer\n   network.  This is conceptually\
    \ equivalent to a centralized route\n   server.\n   In a PE router, PE-received\
    \ routes are not advertised back to other\n   PEs.  It is this split-horizon technique\
    \ that prevents routing loops\n   in an IP VPN environment.  This is also consistent\
    \ with the behavior\n   of a top-level mesh of route reflectors (RRs).\n   In\
    \ order to complete the Route Server model, it is necessary to be\n   able to\
    \ transparently carry the Internal BGP path attributes of\n   customer network\
    \ routes through the BGP/MPLS VPN core.  This is\n   achieved by using a new BGP\
    \ path attribute, described below, that\n   allows the customer network attributes\
    \ to be saved and restored at\n   the BGP/MPLS VPN boundaries.\n   When a route\
    \ is advertised from PE to CE, if it is advertised as an\n   iBGP route, the CE\
    \ will not advertise it further unless it is itself\n   configured as a route\
    \ reflector (or has an External BGP session).\n   This is a consequence of the\
    \ default BGP behavior of not advertising\n   iBGP routes back to iBGP peers.\
    \  This behavior is not modified.\n   On a BGP/MPLS VPN PE, a CE-received route\
    \ MUST be advertised to other\n   VPN PEs that import the Route Targets that are\
    \ associated with the\n   route.  This is independent of whether the CE route\
    \ has been received\n   as an external or internal route.  However, a CE-received\
    \ route is\n   not re-advertised back to other CEs unless route reflection is\n\
    \   explicitly configured.  This is the equivalent of disabling client-\n   to-client\
    \ reflection in BGP route reflection implementations.\n   When reflection is configured\
    \ on the PE router, with local CE routers\n   as clients, there is no need to\
    \ internally mesh multiple CEs that may\n   exist in the site.\n   This Route\
    \ Server model can also be used to support a confederation-\n   style abstraction\
    \ to CE devices.  At this point, we choose not to\n   describe in detail the procedures\
    \ for that mode of operation.\n   Confederations are considered to be less common\
    \ than route reflection\n   in enterprise environments.\n"

    \             <--  pop path attributes <--  vrf-import <--\n   The diagram above\
    \ shows the BGP path attribute stack processing in\n   relation to existing BGP/MPLS\
    \ IP VPN [RFC4364] route processing\n   procedures.  BGP path attributes received\
    \ from a customer network are\n   pushed into the stack, before adding the Export\
    \ Route Targets to the\n   BGP path attributes.  Conversely, the stack is popped\
    \ following the\n   Import Target processing step that identifies the VPN Routing\
    \ and\n   Forwarding (VRF) table in which a PE-received route is accepted.\n \
    \  When the advertising PE performs a \"push\" operation at the\n   \"vrf-export\"\
    \ processing stage, it SHOULD initialize the attributes of\n   the BGP IP VPN\
    \ route advertisement as it would for a locally\n   originated route from the\
    \ respective VRF context.\n   When a PE-received route is imported into a VRF,\
    \ its IGP metric, as\n   far as BGP path selection is concerned, SHOULD be the\
    \ metric to the\n   remote PE address, expressed in terms of the service provider\
    \ metric\n   domain.\n   For the purposes of VRF route selection performed at\
    \ the PE, between\n   routes received from local CEs and remote PEs, customer\
    \ network IGP\n   metrics SHOULD always be considered higher (and thus least preferred)\n\
    \   than local site metrics.\n   When backdoor links are present, this would tend\
    \ to direct the\n   traffic between two sites through the backdoor link for BGP\
    \ routes\n   originated by a remote site.  However, BGP already has policy\n \
    \  mechanisms, such as the LOCAL_PREF attribute, to address this type of\n   situation.\n\
    \   When a given CE is connected to more than one PE, it will not\n   advertise\
    \ the route that it receives from a PE to another PE unless\n   configured as\
    \ a route reflector, due to the standard BGP route\n   advertisement rules.\n\
    \   When a CE reflects a PE-received route to another PE, the fact that\n   the\
    \ original attributes of a route are preserved across the VPN\n   prevents the\
    \ formation of routing loops due to mutual redistribution\n   between the two\
    \ networks.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.  BGP Customer Route Attributes\n   In order to transparently carry the BGP\
    \ path attributes of customer\n   routes, this document defines a new BGP path\
    \ attribute:\n      ATTR_SET (type code 128)\n      ATTR_SET is an optional transitive\
    \ attribute that carries a set of\n      BGP path attributes.  An attribute set\
    \ (ATTR_SET) can include any\n      BGP attribute that can occur in a BGP UPDATE\
    \ message, except for\n      the MP_REACH and MP_UNREACH attributes.\n   The ATTR_SET\
    \ attribute is encoded as follows:\n                      +------------------------------+\n\
    \                      | Attr Flags (O|T) Code = 128  |\n                    \
    \  +------------------------------+\n                      | Attr. Length (1 or\

    \                      | Path Attributes (variable)   |\n                    \
    \  +------------------------------+\n   The Attribute Flags are encoded according\
    \ to RFC 4271 [RFC4271].  The\n   Extended Length bit determines whether the Attribute\
    \ Length is one or\n   two octets.\n   The attribute value consists of a 4-octet\
    \ \"Origin AS\" value followed\n   by a variable-length field that conforms to\
    \ the BGP UPDATE message\n   path attribute encoding rules.  The length of this\
    \ attribute is 4\n   plus the total length of the encoded attributes.\n   The\
    \ ATTR_SET attribute is used by a PE router to store the original\n   set of BGP\
    \ attributes it receives from a CE.  When a PE router\n   advertises a PE-received\
    \ route to a CE, it will use the path\n   attributes carried in the ATTR_SET attribute.\n\
    \   In other words, the BGP path attributes are \"pushed\" into this\n   attribute,\
    \ which operates as a stack, when the route is received by\n   the VPN and \"\
    popped\" when the route is advertised in the PE-to-CE\n   direction.\n   Using\
    \ this mechanism isolates the customer network from the\n   attributes used in\
    \ the customer network and vice versa.  Attributes\n   such as the route reflection\
    \ cluster list attribute are segregated\n   such that customer network cluster\
    \ identifiers won't be considered by\n   the customer network route reflectors\
    \ and vice versa.\n   The Origin autonomous-system number is designed to prevent\
    \ a route\n   originating in a given autonomous-system iBGP from being leaked\
    \ into\n   a different autonomous system without proper AS_PATH manipulation.\n\
    \   It SHOULD contain the autonomous-system number of the customer\n   network\
    \ that originates the given set of attributes.  The value is\n   encoded as a\
    \ 32-bit unsigned integer in network byte order,\n   regardless of whether or\
    \ not the originating PE supports 4-octet AS\n   numbers [RFC4893].\n   The AS_PATH\
    \ and AGGREGATOR attributes contained within an ATTR_SET\n   attribute MUST be\
    \ encoded using 4-octet AS numbers [RFC4893],\n   regardless of the capabilities\
    \ advertised by the BGP speaker to which\n   the ATTR_SET attribute is transmitted.\
    \  BGP speakers that support the\n   extensions defined in this document MUST\
    \ also support RFC 4893\n   [RFC4893].  The reason for this requirement is to\
    \ remove ambiguity\n   between 2-octet and 4-octet AS_PATH attribute encoding.\n\
    \   The NEXT_HOP attribute SHOULD NOT be included in an ATTR_SET.  When\n   present,\
    \ it SHOULD be ignored by the receiving PE.  Future\n   applications of the ATTR_SET\
    \ attribute MAY define meaningful\n   semantics for an included NEXT_HOP attribute.\n\
    \   The ATTR_SET attribute SHALL be considered malformed if any of the\n   following\
    \ apply:\n   o  Its length is less than 4 octets.\n   o  The original path attributes\
    \ carried in the variable-length\n      attribute data include the MP_REACH or\
    \ MP_UNREACH attribute.\n   o  The included attributes are malformed themselves.\n\
    \   An UPDATE message with a malformed ATTR_SET attribute SHALL be\n   handled\
    \ as follows.  If its Partial flag is set and its\n   Neighbor-Complete flag is\
    \ clear, the UPDATE is treated as a route\n   withdraw as discussed in [OPT-TRANS-BGP].\
    \  Otherwise (i.e., Partial\n   flag is clear or Neighbor-Complete is set), the\
    \ procedures of the\n   BGP-4 base specification [RFC4271] MUST be followed with\
    \ respect to\n   an Optional Attribute Error.\n"

  - "6.  Next-Hop Handling\n   When BGP/MPLS VPNs are not in use, the NEXT_HOP attribute\

    \ an\n   important component of BGP route selection.\n   When a BGP/MPLS VPN service\
    \ is used to provide interconnection\n   between different sites, since the customer\

  - "7.  Exchanging Routes between Different VPN Customer Networks\n   In the traditional\
    \ model, where External BGP sessions are used\n   between the BGP/MPLS VPN PE\
    \ and CE, the PE router identifies itself\n   as belonging to the customer network\
    \ autonomous system.\n   In order to use Internal BGP sessions, the PE router\
    \ has to identify\n   itself as belonging to the customer AS.  More specifically,\
    \ the VRF\n   that is used to interconnect to that customer site is assigned to\
    \ the\n   customer AS rather than the VPN provider AS.\n   The Origin AS element\
    \ in the ATTR_SET path attribute conveys the\n   AS number of the originating\
    \ VRF.  This AS number is used in a\n   receiving PE in order to identify route\
    \ exchanges between VRFs in\n   different ASes.\n   In scenarios such as what\
    \ is commonly referred to as an \"extranet\"\n   VPN, routes MAY be advertised\
    \ to both internal and external VPN\n   attachments belonging to different autonomous\
    \ systems.\n                          +-----+                 +-----+\n      \

    \  AS 2            AS 1\n   Consider the example given above, where (PE1, CE1)\
    \ and (PE2, CE3)\n   sessions are iBGP.  In BGP/MPLS VPNs, a route received from\
    \ CE1 above\n   may be distributed to the VRFs corresponding to the attachment\
    \ points\n   for CEs 2 and 3.\n   The desired result in such a scenario is to\
    \ present the internal peer\n   (CE3) with a BGP advertisement that contains the\
    \ same BGP path\n   attributes received from CE1, and to present the external\
    \ peer (CE2)\n   with a BGP advertisement that would correspond to a situation\
    \ where\n   AS 1 and AS 2 have an External BGP session between them.\n   In order\
    \ to achieve this goal, the following set of rules applies:\n      When importing\
    \ a VPN route that contains the ATTR_SET attribute\n      into a destination VRF,\
    \ a PE router MUST check that the \"Origin\n      AS\" number contained in the\
    \ ATTR_SET attribute matches the\n      autonomous system associated with the\
    \ VRF.\n      In case the autonomous-system numbers do match, the route is\n \
    \     imported into the VRF with the attributes contained in the\n      ATTR_SET\
    \ attribute.  Otherwise, in the case of an autonomous-\n      system number mismatch,\
    \ the set of attributes to be associated\n      with the route SHALL be constructed\
    \ as follows:\n      1.  The path attributes are set to the attributes contained\
    \ in the\n          ATTR_SET attribute.\n      2.  iBGP-specific attributes are\
    \ discarded (LOCAL_PREF,\n          ORIGINATOR, CLUSTER_LIST, etc).\n      3.\
    \  The \"Origin AS\" number contained in the ATTR_SET attribute\n          is\
    \ prepended to the AS_PATH following the rules that would\n          apply to\
    \ an External BGP peering between the source and\n          destination ASes.\n\
    \      4.  If the autonomous system associated with the VRF is the same\n    \
    \      as the VPN provider autonomous system and the AS_PATH\n          attribute\
    \ of the VPN route is not empty, it SHALL be prepended\n          to the AS_PATH\
    \ attribute of the VRF route.\n      When advertising the VRF route to an External\
    \ BGP peer, a PE\n      router SHALL apply steps 1 to 4 defined above and subsequently\n\
    \      prepend its own autonomous-system number to the AS_PATH attribute.\n  \
    \    For example, if the route originated in a VRF that supports\n      Internal\
    \ BGP peering and the ATTR_SET attribute and is advertised\n      to a CE that\
    \ is configured in the traditional External BGP mode,\n      then the originator\
    \ AS, the VPN AS_PATH segment, and the customer\n      network AS are prepended\
    \ to the AS_PATH.\n      When importing a route without the ATTR_SET attribute\
    \ to a VRF\n      that is configured in a different autonomous system, a PE router\n\
    \      MUST prepend the VPN provider AS number to the AS_PATH.\n   In all cases\
    \ where a route containing the ATTR_SET attribute is\n   imported, attributes\
    \ present on the VPN route other than the NEXT_HOP\n   attribute are ignored,\
    \ both from the point of view of route selection\n   in the VRF Adj-RIB-In and\
    \ route advertisement to a CE router.  In\n   other words, the information contained\
    \ in the ATTR_SET attribute\n   overrides the VPN route attributes on \"vrf-import\"\
    .\n"

    \   attributes without interfering with its operations.\n   Another example of\
    \ unwanted interaction between customer and IP VPN\n   BGP attributes is a scenario\
    \ where the same service provider\n   autonomous-system number is used to provide\
    \ Internet service as well\n   as the IP VPN service.  In this case, it is not\
    \ uncommon to have a\n   VPN customer route contain the AS number of the service\
    \ provider.\n   The IP VPN should work transparently in this case as in all others.\n\
    \   This protocol extension is designed to behave such that each PE VRF\n   operates\
    \ as a router in the configured AS.  Previously, VRFs operated\n   in the provider\
    \ network AS only.  The VPN backbone provides\n   interconnection between VRFs\
    \ of the same AS, as well as\n   interconnection between different ASes (subject\
    \ to the appropriate\n   policies).  When interconnecting VRFs in the same AS,\
    \ the VPN\n   backbone operates as a top-level route reflection mesh.  When\n\
    \   interconnecting VRFs in different ASes, the provider network provides\n  \
    \ an implicit peering relationship between the ASes that originate and\n   import\
    \ a specific route.\n   This extension is also applicable to scenarios where the\
    \ VPN backbone\n   spans multiple ASes.  When the VPN backbone Inter-AS operation\n\
    \   follows option b) or c) as defined in Section 10 of [RFC4364], the\n   provider\
    \ networks are able to influence the route attributes and\n   route selection\
    \ of the VPN routes while providing a transparent\n   service to the customer\
    \ AS.  Either Internal BGP connectivity or\n   extranets can be provided to the\
    \ customer AS.\n   When VPN provider networks interconnect via option a), there\
    \ is no\n   possibility of providing a fully transparent service.  By definition,\n\
    \   option a) implies that each autonomous-system border router (ASBR)\n   has\
    \ a VRF associated with the customer VPN that is configured to\n   operate in\
    \ the respective provider AS.  These ASBR VRFs then\n   communicate via External\
    \ BGP with their peer provider ASes.\n   In this case, it is still possible to\
    \ have all the customer VRFs with\n   one provider network be configured in the\
    \ same customer AS.  This\n   customer AS will then peer with the provider AS\
    \ implicitly at the\n   ASBR, which will in turn peer explicitly with a second\
    \ provider AS.\n   This is not, however, a scenario in which transparency to the\n\
    \   customer AS is possible.\n"

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   It is worthwhile to consider the security implications\
    \ of this\n   proposal from two independent perspectives: the IP VPN provider\
    \ and\n   the IP VPN customer.\n   From an IP VPN provider perspective, this mechanism\
    \ will assure\n   separation between the BGP path attributes advertised by the\
    \ CE\n   router and the BGP attributes used within the provider network, thus\n\
    \   potentially improving security.\n   Although this behavior is largely implementation\
    \ dependent, it is\n   currently possible for a CE device to inject BGP attributes\
    \ (extended\n   communities, for example) that have semantics on the IP VPN provider\n\
    \   network, unless explicitly disabled by configuration in the PE.\n   With the\
    \ rules specified for the ATTR_SET path attribute, any\n   attribute that has\
    \ been received from a CE is pushed into the stack\n   before the route is advertised\
    \ to other PEs.\n   As with any other field based on values received from an external\n\
    \   system, an implementation must consider the issues of input\n   validation\
    \ and resource management.\n   From the perspective of the VPN customer network,\
    \ it is our opinion\n   that there is no change to the security profile of PE-CE\
    \ interaction.\n   While having an iBGP session allows the PE to specify additional\n\
    \   attributes not allowed on an External BGP session (e.g., LOCAL_PREF),\n  \
    \ this does not significantly change the fact that the VPN customer\n   must trust\
    \ its service provider to provide it with correct routing\n   information.\n"
