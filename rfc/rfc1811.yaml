- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document describes the registration policies for the top-level\n\
    \   domain \".GOV\".   Thus far, Federal Agencies and their subsidiaries\n   have\
    \ registered without any guidance.  This has resulted in multiple\n   registrations\
    \ for Federal Agencies and naming schemes that do not\n   facilitate responsiveness\
    \ to the public.  This document fixes this by\n   restricting registrations to\
    \ coincide with the approved structure of\n   the US government.  The document\
    \ cited, FIPS 95-1, provides a\n   standard recognized structure into which domain\
    \ registrations for\n   top-level domains.  The IANA requires that an organization/country\n\
    \   apply for and get a 2 letter code from ISO/ITU (e.g., US for United\n   States)\
    \ for additional top-level registration.\n   As a side effect, this reduces the\
    \ number of .GOV level registrations\n   and reduces the workload on the Internic.\n"
- title: U.S. GOVERNMENT INTERNET DOMAIN NAMES POLICY
  contents:
  - "U.S. GOVERNMENT INTERNET DOMAIN NAMES POLICY\n   The .GOV domain is delegated\
    \ from the root authority to the US\n   Federal Networking Council.  The .GOV\
    \ domain is for registration of\n   US governmental entities on the federal level\
    \ only.  Registrations\n   for state and local governmental agencies shall be\
    \ made under the .US\n   domain in accordance with the policies for that domain.\n\
    \   1) The document \"Codes for the Identification of Federal and\n   Federally\
    \ Assisted Organizations\", FIPS 95-1 (or its successor)\n   lists the official\
    \ names of US Government agencies.\n     A) Top-level entities (e.g., those with\
    \ codes ending in 00 such as\n     \"1200 Department of Agriculture\"), and independent\
    \ agencies and\n     organizations (e.g., \"National Science Foundation and other\
    \ non-\n     indented listings unless prohibited below) as listed in this\n  \
    \   document are eligible for registration directly under .GOV.\n     B) Autonomous\
    \ law enforcement components of top-level entities\n     (e.g., \"Federal Bureau\
    \ of Investigation\", \"Secret Service\", \"Coast\n     Guard\") are also eligible\
    \ for registration.\n     C) Cross-agency collaborative organizations (e.g., \"\
    Federal\n     Networking Council\", \"Information Infrastructure Task Force\"\
    ) are\n     eligible for registration under .GOV upon presentation of the\n  \
    \   chartering document and are the only non-FIPS-listed\n     organizations eligible\
    \ for registration under .GOV.\n     D) Subsidiary, non-autonomous components\
    \ of top-level or other\n     entities are not eligible for separate registration.\n\
    \     International organizations listed in this document are NOT\n     eligible\
    \ for registration under .GOV.\n     E) Organizations listed as \"Federally Aided\
    \ Organizations\" are not\n     eligible for registration under .GOV and should\
    \ register under\n     .ORG or other appropriate top-level domain.\n     F) Organizations\
    \ subsidiary to \"Department of Defense\" must\n     register under the \".MIL\"\
    \ domain via the Defense Data Network\n     Network Information Center - contact\
    \ registrar@nic.ddn.mil.\n   The only standard exceptions to these rules are changes\
    \ to\n   governmental structure due to statutory, regulatory or executive\n  \
    \ directives not yet reflected in the above document.  The requesting\n   agency\
    \ should provide documentation in one of the above forms to\n   request an exception.\
    \  Other requests for exception should be\n   referred to the Federal Networking\
    \ Council.\n   2) A domain name should be derived from the official name for the\n\
    \   organization (e.g., \"USDA.Gov\" or \"Agriculture.GOV\".)  The\n   registration\
    \ shall be listed in the registration database under the\n   official name (per\
    \ FIPS 95-1) for the organization or under the name\n   in the chartering document.\n\
    \   3) Only ONE registration and delegation shall be made per agency.\n   The\
    \ .GOV registration authority shall provide registrations on a\n   first-come\
    \ first-served basis.  It is an individual agency matter as\n   to which portion\
    \ of the agency is responsible for managing the domain\n   space under a delegated\
    \ agency domain.\n   4) Those agencies and entities that have multiple registrations\
    \ under\n   .GOV may retain them for a maximum of 3 years from the publication\n\
    \   date of this document.  Within 6 months after the publication of this\n  \
    \ document, one primary domain must be selected for the agency.  The\n   other\
    \ (secondary) domains must cease further sub-delegations and\n   registrations\
    \ at this time.  As of 1 year after the publication of\n   this document, the\
    \ secondary domains will become undelegated and will\n   revert to the control\
    \ of the .GOV owner. As of 2 years after the\n   publication of this document,\
    \ all registrations in the secondary\n   domains must be mirrored in the primary\
    \ domain and those names should\n   be used where possible. At the 3 year point,\
    \ all secondary domain\n   registrations will be deleted.\n   5) Those agencies\
    \ and entities already registered in .GOV but not\n   listed in FIPS 95-1 (e.g.,\
    \ DOE labs, state entities) may retain their\n   registration within the constraint\
    \ of the single registration rule\n   (see para 4).  No further non-FIPS-listed\
    \ registrations will be made.\n   State and local entities are strongly encouraged\
    \ to re-register under\n   .US, but this is not mandatory.\n"
