    \                A growing number of devices on a network can produce\n      \

    \   using protocols like NFS, remote disk backup systems\n                like\
    \ rdump, and remote tape access systems can be\n                configured such\
    \ that a single request can result in\n                a block of data being returned\
    \ of as much as 64K octets.\n                Over networks like ethernet with\
    \ a relatively small MTU\n                this results in many fragments to be\

    \      cause an endless loop as the sender repetitively\n                attempts\

    \                Variability of latency can be a problem.\n                Some\
    \ protocols are timing dependent (e.g., LAT and IPX).\n                Future\
    \ applications are likely to be sensitive to\n                network latency.\
    \  Increased device delay can reduce\n                the useful diameter of net.\
    \  It is desired to\n                eliminate the effect of the data rate on\
    \ the latency\n                measurement.  This measurement should only reflect\

    \                taken for a spectrum of frame sizes without changing\n      \
    \          the device setup.\n                Ideally, the measurements for all\
    \ devices would be from\n                the first actual bit of the frame after\
    \ the preamble.\n                Theoretically a vendor could design a device\
    \ that\n                normally would be considered a store and forward\n   \
    \             device, a bridge for example, that begins transmitting\n       \
    \         a frame before it is fully received.  This type of\n               \
    \ device is known as a \"cut through\" device.  The\n                assumption\
    \ is that the device would somehow invalidate\n                the partially transmitted\
    \ frame if in receiving the\n                remainder of the input frame, something\
    \ came up that\n                the frame or this specific forwarding of it was\
    \ in\n                error.  For example, a bad checksum.  In this case,\n  \
    \              the device would still be considered a store and\n            \
    \    forward device and the latency would still be\n                from last\
    \ bit in to first bit out, even though the\n                value would be negative.\
    \  The intent is to treat\n                the device as a unit without regard\
