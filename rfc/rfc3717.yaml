  - "1.  Introduction\n   Optical network technologies are evolving rapidly in terms\
    \ of\n   functions and capabilities.  The increasing importance of optical\n \
    \  networks is evidenced by the copious amount of attention focused on\n   IP\
    \ over optical networks and related photonic and electronic\n   interworking issues\
    \ by all major network service providers,\n   telecommunications equipment vendors,\
    \ and standards organizations. In\n   this regard, the term \"optical network\"\
    \ is used generically in\n   practice to refer to both SONET/SDH-based transport\
    \ networks, as well\n   as switched optical networks (including all-optical networks).\n\
    \   It has been realized that optical networks must be survivable,\n   flexible,\
    \ and controllable.  There is, therefore, an ongoing trend to\n   introduce intelligence\
    \ in the control plane of optical networks to\n   make them more versatile [1].\
    \  An essential attribute of intelligent\n   optical networks is the capability\
    \ to instantiate and route optical\n   layer connections in real-time or near\
    \ real-time, and to provide\n   capabilities that enhance network survivability.\
    \  Furthermore, there\n   is a need for multi-vendor optical network interoperability,\
    \ when an\n   optical network may consist of interconnected vendor-specific optical\n\
    \   sub-networks.\n   The optical network must also be versatile because some\
    \ service\n   providers may offer generic optical layer services that may not\
    \ be\n   client-specific.  It would therefore be necessary to have an optical\n\
    \   network control plane that can handle such generic optical services.\n   There\
    \ is general consensus in the industry that the optical network\n   control plane\
    \ should utilize IP-based protocols for dynamic\n   provisioning and restoration\
    \ of optical channels within and across\n   optical sub-networks.  This is based\
    \ on the practical view that\n   signaling and routing mechanisms developed for\
    \ IP traffic engineering\n   applications could be re-used in optical networks.\
    \ Nevertheless, the\n   issues and requirements that are specific to optical networking\
    \ must\n   be understood to suitably adopt and adapt the IP-based protocols.\n\
    \   This is especially the case for restoration, and for routing and\n   signaling\
    \ in all-optical networks.  Also, there are different views\n   on the model for\
    \ interaction between the optical network and client\n   networks, such as IP\
    \ networks.  Reasonable architectural alternatives\n   in this regard must be\
    \ supported, with an understanding of their\n   relative merits.\n   Thus, there\
    \ are two fundamental issues related to IP over optical\n   networks.  The first\
    \ is the adaptation and reuse of IP control plane\n   protocols within the optical\
    \ network control plane, irrespective of\n   the types of digital clients that\
    \ utilize the optical network.  The\n   second is the transport of IP traffic\
    \ through an optical network\n   together with the control and coordination issues\
    \ that arise\n   therefrom.\n   This document defines a framework for IP over\
    \ optical networks\n   covering the requirements and mechanisms for establishing\
    \ an IP-\n   centric optical control plane, and the architectural aspects of IP\n\
    \   transport over optical networks.  In this regard, it is recognized\n   that\
    \ the specific capabilities required for IP over optical networks\n   would depend\
    \ on the services expected at the IP-optical interface as\n   well as the optical\
    \ sub-network interfaces.  Depending on the\n   specific operational requirements,\
    \ a progression of capabilities is\n   possible, reflecting increasingly sophisticated\
    \ interactions at these\n   interfaces.  This document therefore advocates the\
    \ definition of\n   \"capability sets\" that define the evolution of functionality\
    \ at the\n   interfaces as more sophisticated operational requirements arise.\n\
    \   This document is organized as follows.  In the next section,\n   terminology\
    \ covering some basic concepts related to this framework\n   are described.  The\
    \ definitions are specific to this framework and\n   may have other connotations\
    \ elsewhere.  In Section 3, the network\n   model pertinent to this framework\
    \ is described.  The service model\n   and requirements for IP-optical, and multi-vendor\
    \ optical\n   internetworking are described in Section 4.  This section also\n\
    \   considers some general requirements.  Section 5 considers the\n   architectural\
    \ models for IP-optical interworking, describing the\n   relative merits of each\
    \ model.  It should be noted that it is not the\n   intent of this document to\
    \ promote any particular model over the\n   others.  However, particular aspects\
    \ of the models that may make one\n   approach more appropriate than another in\
    \ certain circumstances are\n   described.  Section 6 describes IP-centric control\
    \ plane mechanisms\n   for optical networks, covering signaling and routing issues\
    \ in\n   support of provisioning and restoration.  The approaches described in\n\
    \   Section 5 and 6 range from the relatively simple to the\n   sophisticated.\
    \  Section 7 describes a number of specialized issues in\n   relation to IP over\
    \ optical networks.  Section 8 describes a possible\n   evolution path for IP\
    \ over optical networking capabilities in terms\n   of increasingly sophisticated\
    \ functionality that may be supported as\n   the need arises.  Section 9 considers\
    \ security issues pertinent to\n   this framework.  Finally, the summary and conclusion\
    \ are presented in\n   Section 10.\n"

  - "2.  Terminology and Concepts\n   This section introduces  terminology pertinent\
    \ to this framework and\n   some related concepts.  The definitions are specific\
    \ to this\n   framework and may have other interpretations elsewhere.\n   WDM\n\
    \   Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is a technology that allows\n   multiple\
    \ optical signals operating at different wavelengths to be\n   multiplexed onto\
    \ a single optical fiber and transported in parallel\n   through the fiber.  In\
    \ general, each optical wavelength may carry\n   digital client payloads at a\
    \ different data rate (e.g., OC-3c, OC-\n   12c, OC- 48c, OC-192c, etc.) and in\
    \ a different format (SONET,\n   Ethernet, ATM, etc.).  For example, there are\
    \ many commercial WDM\n   networks in existence today that support a mix of SONET\
    \ signals\n   operating at OC-48c (approximately 2.5 Gbps) and OC-192\n   (approximately\
    \ 10 Gbps) over a single optical fiber.  An optical\n   system with WDM capability\
    \ can achieve parallel transmission of\n   multiple wavelengths gracefully while\
    \ maintaining high system\n   performance and reliability.  In the near future,\
    \ commercial dense\n   WDM systems are expected to concurrently carry more than\
    \ 160\n   wavelengths at data rates of OC-192c and above, for a total of 1.6\n\
    \   Tbps or more.  The term WDM will be used in this document to refer to\n  \
    \ both WDM and DWDM (Dense WDM).\n   In general, it is worth noting that WDM links\
    \ are affected by the\n   following factors, which may introduce impairments into\
    \ the optical\n   signal path:\n   1. The number of wavelengths on a single fiber.\n\
    \   2. The serial bit rate per wavelength.\n   3. The type of fiber.\n   4. The\
    \ amplification mechanism.\n   5. The number and type of nodes through which the\
    \ signals pass before\n      reaching the egress node or before regeneration.\n\
    \   All these factors (and others not mentioned here) constitute domain\n   specific\
    \ features of optical transport networks.  As noted in [1],\n   these features\
    \ should be taken into account in developing standards\n   based solutions for\
    \ IP over optical networks.\n   Optical cross-connect (OXC)\n   An OXC is a space-division\
    \ switch that can switch an optical data\n   stream from an input port to a output\
    \ port.  Such a switch may\n   utilize optical-electrical conversion at the input\
    \ port and\n   electrical-optical conversion at the output port, or it may be\
    \ all-\n   optical.  An OXC is assumed to have a control-plane processor that\n\
    \   implements the signaling and routing protocols necessary for\n   computing\
    \ and instantiating optical channel connectivity in the\n   optical domain.\n\
    \   Optical channel trail or Lightpath\n   An optical channel trail is a point-to-point\
    \ optical layer connection\n   between two access points in an optical network.\
    \  In this document,\n   the term \"lightpath\" is used interchangeably with optical\
    \ channel\n   trail.\n   Optical mesh sub-network\n   An optical sub-network,\
    \ as used in this framework, is a network of\n   OXCs that supports end-to-end\
    \ networking of optical channel trails\n   providing functionality like routing,\
    \ monitoring, grooming, and\n   protection and restoration of optical channels.\
    \  The interconnection\n   of OXCs in this network can be based on a general mesh\
    \ topology. The\n   following sub-layers may be associated with this network:\n\
    \   (a) An optical multiplex section (OMS) layer network: The optical\n      \
    \ multiplex section layer provides transport for the optical\n       channels.\
    \  The information contained in this layer is a data\n       stream comprising\
    \ a set of  optical channels, which may have a\n       defined aggregate bandwidth.\n\
    \   (b) An optical transmission section (OTS) layer network: This layer\n    \
    \   provides functionality for transmission of optical signals\n       through\
    \ different types of optical media.\n   This framework does not address the interaction\
    \ between the optical\n   sub-network and the OMS, or between the OMS and OTS\
    \ layer networks.\n   Mesh optical network (or simply, \"optical network\")\n\
    \   A mesh optical network, as used in document, is a topologically\n   connected\
    \ collection of optical sub-networks whose node degree may\n   exceed 2.  Such\
    \ an optical network is assumed to be under the purview\n   of a single administrative\
    \ entity.  It is also possible to conceive\n   of a large scale global mesh optical\
    \ network consisting of the\n   voluntary interconnection of autonomous optical\
    \ networks, each of\n   which is owned and administered by an independent entity.\
    \  In such an\n   environment, abstraction can be used to hide the internal details\
    \ of\n   each autonomous optical cloud from external clouds.\n   Optical internetwork\n\
    \   An optical internetwork is a mesh-connected collection of optical\n   networks.\
    \  Each of these networks may be under a different\n   administration.\n   Wavelength\
    \ continuity property\n   A lightpath is said to satisfy the wavelength continuity\
    \ property if\n   it is transported over the same wavelength end-to-end.  Wavelength\n\
    \   continuity is required in optical  networks with no wavelength\n   conversion\
    \ feature.\n   Wavelength path\n   A lightpath that satisfies the wavelength continuity\
    \ property is\n   called a wavelength path.\n   Opaque vs. transparent optical\
    \ networks\n   A transparent optical network is an optical network in which optical\n\
    \   signals are transported from transmitter to receiver entirely in the\n   optical\
    \ domain without OEO conversion.  Generally, intermediate\n   switching nodes\
    \ in a transparent optical network do not have access\n   to the payload carried\
    \ by the optical signals.\n   Note that amplification  of signals at transit nodes\
    \ is permitted in\n   transparent optical networks (e.g., using Erbium Doped Fiber\n\
    \   Amplifiers << EDFAs).\n   On the other hand, in opaque optical networks, \
    \ transit nodes may\n   manipulate  optical signals traversing through them. \
    \ An example of\n   such manipulation would be OEO conversion which may involve\
    \ 3R\n   operations (reshaping, retiming, regeneration, and perhaps\n   amplification).\n\
    \   Trust domain\n   A trust domain is a network under a single technical administration\n\
    \   in which adequate security measures are established to prevent\n   unauthorized\
    \ intrusion from outside the domain.  Hence, it may be\n   assumed that most nodes\
    \ in the domain are deemed to be secure or\n   trusted in some fashion.  Generally,\
    \ the rule for \"single\"\n   administrative control over a trust domain may be\
    \ relaxed in practice\n   if a set of administrative entities agree to trust one\
    \ another to\n   form an enlarged heterogeneous trust domain.  However, to simplify\n\
    \   the discussions in this document, it will be assumed, without loss of\n  \
    \ generality, that the term trust domain applies to a single\n   administrative\
    \ entity with appropriate security policies.  It should\n   be noted that within\
    \ a trust domain, any subverted node can send\n   control messages which can compromise\
    \ the entire network.\n   Flow\n   In this document, the term flow will be used\
    \ to signify the smallest\n   non-separable stream of data, from the point of\
    \ view of an endpoint\n   or termination point (source or destination node). \
    \ The reader should\n   note that the term flow is heavily overloaded in contemporary\n\
    \   networking literature.  In this document, we will consider a\n   wavelength\
    \ to be a flow, under certain circumstances.  However, if\n   there is a method\
    \ to partition the bandwidth of the wavelength, then\n   each partition may be\
    \ considered a flow, for example using time\n   division multiplexing (TDM), it\
    \ may be feasible to consider each\n   quanta of time within a given wavelength\
    \ as a flow.\n   Traffic Trunk\n   A traffic trunk is an abstraction of traffic\
    \ flow traversing the same\n   path between two access points which allows some\
    \ characteristics and\n   attributes of the traffic to be parameterized.\n"

  - "3.1.  Network Interconnection\n   The network model considered in this memo consists\
    \ of IP routers\n   attached to an optical core internetwork, and connected to\
    \ their\n   peers over dynamically established switched optical channels.  The\n\
    \   optical core itself is assumed to be incapable of processing\n   individual\
    \ IP packets in the data plane.\n   The optical internetwork is assumed to consist\
    \ of multiple optical\n   networks, each of which may be administered by a different\
    \ entity.\n   Each optical network consists of sub-networks interconnected by\n\
    \   optical fiber links in a general topology (referred to as an optical\n   mesh\
    \ network).  This network may contain re-configurable optical\n   equipment from\
    \ a single vendor or from multiple vendors.  In the near\n   term, it may be expected\
    \ that each sub-network will consist of\n   switches from a single vendor.  In\
    \ the future, as standardization\n   efforts mature, each optical sub-network\
    \ may in fact contain optical\n   switches from different vendors.  In any case,\
    \ each sub-network\n   itself is assumed to be mesh-connected internally.  In\
    \ general, it\n   can be expected that topologically adjacent OXCs in an optical\
    \ mesh\n   network will be connected via multiple, parallel (bi-directional)\n\
    \   optical links.  This network model is shown in Figure 1.\n   In this environment,\
    \ an optical sub-network may consist entirely of\n   all-optical OXCs or OXCs\
    \ with optical-electrical-optical (OEO)\n   conversion.  Interconnection between\
    \ sub-networks is assumed to be\n   implemented through compatible physical interfaces,\
    \ with suitable\n   optical-electrical conversions where necessary.  The routers\
    \ that\n   have direct physical connectivity with the optical network are\n  \
    \ referred to as \"edge routers\" with respect to the optical network. As\n  \
    \ shown in Figure 1, other client networks (e.g., ATM) may also connect\n   to\
    \ the optical network.\n   The switching function in an OXC is controlled by appropriately\n\
    \   configuring the cross-connect fabric.  Conceptually, this may be\n   viewed\
    \ as setting up a cross-connect table whose entries are of the\n   form <input\
    \ port i, output port j>, indicating that the data stream\n   entering input port\
    \ i will be switched to output port j.  In the\n   context of a wavelength selective\
    \ cross-connect (generally referred\n   to as a WXC), the cross-connect tables\
    \ may also indicate the input\n   and output wavelengths along with the input\
    \ and output ports.  A\n   lightpath from an ingress port in an OXC to an egress\
    \ port in a\n   remote OXC is established by setting up suitable cross-connects\
    \ in\n   the ingress, the egress and a set of intermediate OXCs such that a\n\
    \   continuous physical path exists from the ingress to the egress port.\n   Optical\
    \ paths tend  to be bi-directional, i.e., the return path from\n   the egress\
    \ port to the ingress port is typically routed along the\n   same set of intermediate\
    \ interface cards as the forward path, but\n   this may not be the case under\
    \ all circumstances.\n                           Optical Network\n           \

- title: 3.2.  Control Structure
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Control Structure\n   There are three logical control interfaces identified\
    \ in Figure 1.\n   These are the client-optical internetwork interface, the internal\n\
    \   node-to-node interface within an optical network (between OXCs in\n   different\
    \ sub-networks), and the external node-to-node interface\n   between nodes in\
    \ different optical networks.  These interfaces are\n   also referred to as the\
    \ User-Network Interface (UNI), the internal\n   NNI (INNI), and the external\
    \ NNI (ENNI), respectively.\n   The distinction between these interfaces arises\
    \ out of the type and\n   amount of control information flow across them.  The\
    \ client-optical\n   internetwork interface (UNI) represents a service boundary\
    \ between\n   the client (e.g., IP router) and the optical network.  The client\
    \ and\n   server (optical network) are essentially two different roles: the\n\
    \   client role requests a service connection from a server; the server\n   role\
    \ establishes the connection to fulfill the service request --\n   provided all\
    \ relevant admission control conditions are satisfied.\n   Thus, the control flow\
    \ across the client-optical internetwork\n   interface is dependent on the set\
    \ of services defined across it and\n   the manner in which the services may be\
    \ accessed.  The service models\n   are described in Section 4.  The NNIs represent\
    \ vendor-independent\n   standardized interfaces for control flow between nodes.\
    \  The\n   distinction between the INNI and the ENNI is that the former is an\n\
    \   interface within a given network under a single technical\n   administration,\
    \ while the later indicates an interface at the\n   administrative boundary between\
    \ networks.  The INNI and ENNI may thus\n   differ in the policies that restrict\
    \ control flow between nodes.\n   Security, scalability, stability, and information\
    \ hiding are\n   important considerations in the specification of the ENNI.  It\
    \ is\n   possible in principle to harmonize the control flow across the UNI\n\
    \   and the NNI and eliminate the distinction between them.  On the other\n  \
    \ hand, it may be required to minimize flow of control information,\n   especially\
    \ routing-related information, over the UNI; and even over\n   the ENNI.  In this\
    \ case, UNI and NNIs may look different in some\n   respects.  In this document,\
    \ these interfaces are treated as\n   distinct.\n   The client-optical internetwork\
    \ interface can be categorized as\n   public or private depending upon context\
    \ and service models.  Routing\n   information (i.e., topology state information)\
    \ can be exchanged\n   across a private client-optical internetwork interface.\
    \  On the other\n   hand, such information is not exchanged across a public client-\n\
    \   optical internetwork interface, or such information may be exchanged\n   with\
    \ very explicit restrictions (including, for example abstraction,\n   filtration,\
    \ etc).  Thus, different relationships (e.g., peer or\n   over-lay, Section 5)\
    \ may occur across private and public logical\n   interfaces.\n   The physical\
    \ control structure used to realize these logical\n   interfaces may vary.  For\
    \ instance, for the client-optical\n   internetwork interface, some of the possibilities\
    \ are:\n   1. Direct interface: An in-band or out-of-band IP control channel\n\
    \      (IPCC) may be implemented between an edge router and each OXC to\n    \
    \  which it is connected.  This control channel is used for\n      exchanging\
    \ signaling and routing messages between the router and\n      the OXC.  With\
    \ a direct interface, the edge router and the OXC it\n      connects to are peers\
    \ with respect to the control plane.  This\n      situation is shown in Figure\
    \ 2.  The type of routing and signaling\n      information exchanged across  the\
    \ direct interface may vary\n      depending on the service definition.  This\
    \ issue is addressed in\n      the next section.  Some choices for  the routing\
    \ protocol are OSPF\n      or ISIS (with traffic engineering extensions and additional\n\
    \      enhancements to deal with the peculiar characteristics of optical\n   \
    \   networks) or BGP, or some other protocol.  Other directory-based\n      routing\
    \ information exchanges are also possible.  Some of the\n      signaling protocol\
    \ choices are adaptations of RSVP-TE or CR-LDP.\n      The details of how the\
    \ IP control channel is realized is outside\n      the scope of this document.\n\
    \   2. Indirect interface: An out-of-band IP control channel may be\n      implemented\
    \ between the client and a device in the optical network\n      to signal service\
    \ requests and responses.  For instance, a\n      management system or a server\
    \ in the optical network may receive\n      service requests from clients.  Similarly,\
    \ out-of-band signaling\n      may be used between management systems in client\
    \ and optical\n      networks to signal service requests.  In these cases, there\
    \ is no\n      direct control interaction between clients and respective OXCs.\n\
    \      One reason to have an indirect interface would be that the OXCs\n     \
    \ and/or clients do not support a direct signaling interface.\n   +---------------------------+\

- title: 4.1.  Domain Services Model
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Domain Services Model\n   Under the domain services model, the optical\
    \ network primarily offers\n   high bandwidth connectivity in the form of lightpaths.\
    \ Standardized\n   signaling across the UNI (Figure 1) is used to invoke the following\n\
    \   services:\n   1. Lightpath creation: This service allows a lightpath with\
    \ the\n      specified attributes to be created between a pair of termination\n\
    \      points in the optical network.  Lightpath creation may be subject\n   \
    \   to network-defined policies (e.g., connectivity restrictions) and\n      security\
    \ procedures.\n   2. Lightpath deletion: This service allows an existing lightpath\
    \ to\n      be deleted.\n   3. Lightpath modification: This service allows certain\
    \ parameters of\n      the lightpath to be modified.\n   4. Lightpath status enquiry:\
    \ This service allows the status of\n      certain parameters of the lightpath\
    \ (referenced by its ID) to be\n      queried by the router that created the lightpath.\n\
    \   An end-system discovery procedure may be used over the UNI to verify\n   local\
    \ port connectivity between the optical and client devices, and\n   allows each\
    \ device to bootstrap the UNI control channel.  Finally, a\n   \"service discovery\"\
    \ procedure may be employed as a precursor to\n   obtaining UNI services.  Service\
    \ discovery allows a client to\n   determine the static parameters of the interconnection\
    \ with the\n   optical network, including the UNI signaling protocols supported.\n\
    \   The protocols for neighbor and service discovery are different from\n   the\
    \ UNI signaling protocol itself (for example, see LMP [2]).\n   Because a small\
    \ set of well-defined services is offered across the\n   UNI, the signaling protocol\
    \ requirements are minimal.  Specifically,\n   the signaling protocol is required\
    \ to convey a few messages with\n   certain attributes in a point-to-point manner\
    \ between the router and\n   the optical network.  Such a protocol may be based\
    \ on RSVP-TE or LDP,\n   for example.\n   The optical domain services model does\
    \ not deal with the type and\n   nature of routing protocols within and across\
    \ optical networks.\n   The optical domain services model would result in the\
    \ establishment\n   of a lightpath topology between routers at the edge of the\
    \ optical\n   network.  The resulting overlay model for IP over optical networks\
    \ is\n   discussed in Section 5.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Unified Service Model
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Unified Service Model\n   Under this model, the IP and optical networks\
    \ are treated together as\n   a single integrated network from a control plane\
    \ point of view. In\n   this regard, the OXCs are treated just like any other\
    \ router as far\n   as the control plane is considered.  Thus, in principle, there\
    \ is no\n   distinction between the UNI, NNIs and any other router-to-router\n\
    \   interface from a routing and signaling point of view.  It is assumed\n   that\
    \ this control plane is IP-based, for example leveraging the\n   traffic engineering\
    \ extensions for MPLS or GMPLS, as described in\n   [1].  The unified service\
    \ model has so far been discussed only in the\n   context of a single administrative\
    \ domain.  A unified control plane\n   is possible even when there are administrative\
    \ boundaries within an\n   optical internetwork, but some of the integrated routing\
    \ capabilities\n   may  not be practically attractive or even feasible in this\
    \ case (see\n   Section 5).\n   Under the unified service model and within the\
    \ context of a GMPLS\n   network, optical network services are obtained implicitly\
    \ during\n   end-to-end GMPLS signaling.  Specifically, an edge router can create\n\
    \   a lightpath with specified attributes, or delete and modify\n   lightpaths\
    \ as it creates GMPLS label-switched paths (LSPs).  In this\n   regard, the services\
    \ obtained from the optical network are similar to\n   the domain services model.\
    \  These services, however, may be invoked\n   in a more seamless manner as compared\
    \ to the domain services model.\n   For instance, when routers are attached to\
    \ a single optical network\n   (i.e., there are no ENNIs), a remote router could\
    \ compute an end-to-\n   end path across the optical internetwork.  It can then\
    \ establish an\n   LSP across the optical internetwork.  But the edge routers\
    \ must still\n   recognize that an LSP  across the optical internetwork is a\n\
    \   lightpath, or a conduit for multiple packet-based LSPs.\n   The concept of\
    \ \"forwarding adjacency\" can be used to specify virtual\n   links across optical\
    \ internetworks in routing protocols such as OSPF\n   [3].  In essence, once a\
    \ lightpath is established across an optical\n   internetwork between two edge\
    \ routers, the lightpath can be\n   advertised as a forwarding adjacency (a virtual\
    \ link) between these\n   routers.  Thus, from a data plane point of view, the\
    \ lightpaths\n   result in a virtual overlay between edge routers.  The decisions\
    \ as\n   to when to create such lightpaths, and the bandwidth management for\n\
    \   these lightpaths is identical in both the domain services model and\n   the\
    \ unified service model.  The routing and signaling models for\n   unified services\
    \ is described in Sections 5 and 6.\n"

  - "4.3.  Which Service Model?\n   The relative merits of the above service models\
    \ can be debated at\n   length, but the approach recommended in this framework\
    \ is to define\n   routing and signaling mechanisms in support of both models.\
    \  As noted\n   above, signaling for service requests can be unified to cover\
    \ both\n   models.  The developments in GMPLS signaling [4] for the unified\n\
    \   service model and its adoption for UNI signaling [5, 6] under the\n   domain\

  - "5.  IP transport over Optical Networks\n   To examine the architectural alternatives\
    \ for IP over optical\n   networks, it is important to distinguish between the\
    \ data and control\n   planes.  The optical network provides a service to external\
    \ entities\n   in the form of fixed bandwidth transport pipes (optical paths).\
    \  IP\n   routers at the edge of the optical networks must necessarily have\n\
    \   such paths established between them before communication at the IP\n   layer\
    \ can commence.  Thus, the IP data plane over optical networks is\n   realized\
    \ over a virtual topology of optical paths.  On the other\n   hand, IP routers\
    \ and OXCs can have a peer relation with respect to\n   the control plane, especially\
    \ for routing protocols that permit the\n   dynamic discovery of IP endpoints\
    \ attached to the optical network.\n   The IP over optical network architecture\
    \ is defined essentially by\n   the organization of the control plane.  The assumption\
    \ in this\n   framework is that an IP-based control plane [1] is used, such as\n\
    \   GMPLS.  Depending on the service model(Section 4), however, the\n   control\
    \ planes in the IP and optical networks can be loosely or\n   tightly coupled.\
    \  This coupling determines the following\n   characteristics:\n   o  The details\
    \ of the topology and routing information advertised by\n      the optical network\

    \ exercise in selecting\n      explicit paths for connections across the optical\
    \ network;\n   o  Policies regarding the dynamic provisioning of optical paths\n\
    \      between routers.  These include access control, accounting, and\n     \

  contents:
  - "5.1.1.  The Peer Model\n   Under the peer model, the IP control plane acts as\
    \ a peer of the\n   optical transport network control plane.  This implies that\
    \ a single\n   instance of the control plane is deployed over the IP and optical\n\
    \   domains.  When there is a single optical network involved and the IP\n   and\
    \ optical domains belong to the same entity, then a common IGP such\n   as OSPF\
    \ or IS-IS, with appropriate extensions, can be used to\n   distribute topology\
    \ information [7] over the integrated IP-optical\n   network.  In the case of\
    \ OSPF, opaque LSAs can be used to advertise\n   topology state information. \
    \ In the case of IS-IS, extended TLVs will\n   have to be defined to propagate\

  contents:
  - "5.2.1.  Integrated Routing\n   This routing approach supports the peer model\
    \ within a single\n   administrative domain.  Under this approach, the IP and\
    \ optical\n   networks are assumed to run the same instance of an IP routing\n\
    \   protocol, e.g., OSPF with suitable \"optical\" extensions.  These\n   extensions\
    \ must capture optical link parameters, and any constraints\n   that are specific\
    \ to optical networks.  The topology and link state\n   information maintained\
    \ by all nodes (OXCs and routers) may be\n   identical, but not necessarily. \
    \ This approach permits a router to\n   compute an end-to-end path to another\
    \ router across the optical\n   network.  Suppose the path computation is triggered\
    \ by the need to\n   route a label switched path (LSP) in a GMPLS environment.\
    \  Such an\n   LSP can be established using GMPLS signaling, e.g., RSVP-TE or\
    \ CR-LDP\n   with appropriate extensions.  In this case, the signaling protocol\n\
    \   will establish a lightpath between two edge routers.  This lightpath\n   is\
    \ in essence a tunnel across the optical network, and may have\n   capacity much\
    \ larger than the bandwidth required to support the first\n   LSP.  Thus, it is\
    \ essential that other routers in the network realize\n   the availability of\
    \ excess capacity within the lightpath so that\n   subsequent LSPs between the\
    \ routers can use it rather than\n   instantiating a new lightpath.  The lightpath\
    \ may therefore be\n   advertised as a virtual link in the topology as a means\
    \ to address\n   this issue.\n   The notion of \"forwarding adjacency\" (FA) described\
    \ in [3] is\n   essential in propagating existing lightpath information to other\n\
    \   routers.  An FA is essentially a virtual link advertised into a link\n   state\
    \ routing protocol.  Thus, an FA could be described by the same\n   parameters\
    \ that define resources in any regular link.  While it is\n   necessary to specify\
    \ the mechanism for creating an FA, it is not\n   necessary to specify how an\
    \ FA is used by the routing scheme.  Once\n   an FA is advertised in a link state\
    \ protocol, its usage for routing\n   LSPs is defined by the route computation\
    \ and traffic engineering\n   algorithms implemented.\n   It should be noted that\
    \ at the IP-optical interface, the physical\n   ports over which routers are connected\
    \ to OXCs constrain the\n   connectivity and resource availability.  Suppose a\
    \ router R1 is\n   connected to OXC O1 over two ports, P1 and P2.  Under integrated\n\
    \   routing, the connectivity between R1 and O1 over the two ports would\n   have\
    \ been captured in the link state representation of the network.\n   Now, suppose\
    \ an FA at full port bandwidth is created from R1 to\n   another router R2 over\
    \ port P1.  While this FA is advertised as a\n   virtual link between R1 and R2,\
    \ it is also necessary to remove the\n   link R1-O1 (over P1) from the link state\
    \ representation since that\n   port is no longer available for creating a lightpath.\
    \  Thus, as FAs\n   are created, an overlaid set of virtual links is introduced\
    \ into the\n   link state representation, replacing the links previously advertised\n\
    \   at the IP-Optical interface.  Finally, the details of the optical\n   network\
    \ captured in the link state representation is replaced by a\n   network of FAs.\
    \  The above scheme is one way to tackle the problem.\n   Another approach is\
    \ to associate appropriate dynamic attributes with\n   link state information,\
    \ so that a link that cannot be used to\n   establish a particular type of connection\
    \ will be appropriately\n   tagged.   Generally, however, there is a great deal\
    \ of similarity\n   between integrated routing   and domain-specific routing (described\n\
    \   next).  Both ultimately deal with the creation of  a virtual\n   lightpath\
    \ topology (which is overlaid over the optical network) to\n   meet certain traffic\
    \ engineering objectives.\n"

- title: 5.2.2.1.  Domain-Specific Routing using BGP
  contents:
  - "5.2.2.1.  Domain-Specific Routing using BGP\n   The inter-domain IP routing protocol,\
    \ BGP [8], may be adapted for\n   exchanging routing information between IP and\
    \ optical domains.  This\n   would allow routers to advertise IP address prefixes\
    \ within their\n   network to the optical internetwork and to receive external\
    \ IP\n   address prefixes from the optical internetwork.  The optical\n   internetwork\
    \ transports the reachability information from one IP\n   network to others. \
    \ For instance, edge routers and OXCs can run\n   exterior BGP (EBGP).  Within\
    \ the optical internetwork, interior BGP\n   (IBGP) is may be used between border\
    \ optical switches, and EBGP may\n   be used between different networks (over\
    \ ENNI, Figure 1).\n   Under this scheme, it may be necessary to identify the\
    \ egress points\n   in the optical internetwork corresponding to externally reachable\
    \ IP\n   addresses.  To see this, suppose an edge router intends to establish\n\
    \   an LSP to a destination node across the optical internetwork.  It may\n  \
    \ request a direct lightpath to that destination, without explicitly\n   specifying\
    \ the egress optical port for the lightpath because the\n   optical internetwork\
    \ has knowledge of externally reachable IP\n   addresses.  However, if the same\
    \ edge router were to establish\n   another LSP to a different external destination,\
    \ then for efficiency\n   reasons, it may first need to determine whether there\
    \ is an existing\n   lightpath (with sufficient residual capacity) to the target\n\
    \   destination.  For this purpose, it may be necessary for edge routers\n   to\
    \ keep track of which egress ports in the optical internetwork lead\n   to which\
    \ external destinations.  Thus, a border OXC receiving\n   external IP prefixes\
    \ from an edge router through EBGP must include\n   its own IP address as the\
    \ egress point before propagating these\n   prefixes to other border OXCs or edge\
    \ routers.  An edge router\n   receiving this information need not propagate the\
    \ egress address\n   further, but it must keep the association   between external\
    \ IP\n   addresses and egress OXC addresses.  When optical VPNs are\n   implemented,\
    \ the address prefixes advertised by the border OXCs may\n   be accompanied by\
    \ some VPN specific identification.\n   There are however, some potential negative\
    \ effects that could result\n   from domain-specific routing using BGP in an IPO\
    \ environment:\n   o  The amount of information that optical nodes will have to\
    \ maintain\n      will not be bound by the size of the optical network anymore,\
    \ but\n      will have to include external routes as well.\n   o  The stability\
    \ of the optical network control plane will no longer\n      be dictated solely\
    \ by the dynamics emanating within the optical\n      network, but may be affected\
    \ by the dynamics originating from\n      external routing domains from which\

    \   This is conceptually similar to the address resolution mechanism used\n  \

    \  Under the\n   first choice, the optical internetwork is actively involved in\
    \ end-\n   to-end protection, whereas under the second choice, any protection\n\
    \   service offered in the optical internetwork is not utilized directly\n   by\
    \ client IP network.  Also, under the first choice, the protection\n   in the\
    \ optical internetwork may apply collectively to a number of IP\n   LSPs.  That\
    \ is, with reference to Figure 5, many LSPs may be\n   aggregated into a single\
    \ lightpath between C and D.  The optical\n   internetwork protection may then\
    \ be applied to all of them at once\n   leading to some gain in scalability. \
    \ Under the second choice, each\n   IP LSP must be separately protected.  Finally,\
    \ the first choice\n   allows different restoration signaling to be implemented\
    \ in the IP\n   and optical internetwork.  These restoration protocols are \"\
    patched\n   up\" at the service boundaries to realize end-to-end protection. \
    \ A\n   further advantage of this is that restoration is entirely contained\n\
    \   within the network where the failure occurs, thereby improving the\n   restoration\
    \ latency, and perhaps network stability as a fault within\n   an optical domain\
    \ is contained and corrected within the domain.  For\n   instance, if there is\
    \ a failure in the optical internetwork, optical\n   network protocols restore\
    \ the affected internal segments.  Under the\n   second choice, restoration signaling\
    \ is always end-to-end between IP\n   routers, essentially by-passing the optical\
    \ internetwork.  A result\n   of this is that restoration latency could be higher.\
    \  In addition,\n   restoration protocols in the IP layer must run transparently\
    \ over the\n   optical internetwork in the overlay mode.  IP based recovery\n\
    \   techniques may however be more resource efficient, as it may be\n   possible\
    \ to convey traffic through the redundant capacity under\n   fault-free scenarios.\
    \  In particular, it may be possible to utilize\n   classification, scheduling,\

  - "6.1.  Addressing\n   For interoperability across optical sub-networks using an\
    \ IP-centric\n   control plane, one of the fundamental issues is that of addressing.\n\
    \   What entities should be identifiable from a signaling and routing\n   point\
    \ of view? How should they be addressed? This section presents\n   some high level\
    \ guidelines on this issue.\n   Identifiable entities in optical networks include\
    \ OXCs, optical\n   links, optical channels and sub-channels, Shared Risk Link\
    \ Groups\n   (SRLGs), etc.  An issue here is how granular the identification\n\
    \   should be as far as the establishment of optical trails are\n   concerned.\
    \  The scheme for identification must accommodate the\n   specification of the\
    \ termination points in the optical network with\n   adequate granularity when\
    \ establishing optical trails.  For instance,\n   an OXC could have many ports,\
    \ each of which may in turn terminate\n   many optical channels, each of which\
    \ contain many sub-channels etc.\n   It is perhaps not reasonable to assume that\
    \ every sub-channel or\n   channel termination, or even OXC ports could be assigned\
    \ a unique IP\n   address.  Also, the routing of an optical trail within the network\n\
    \   does not depend on the precise termination point information, but\n   rather\
    \ only on the terminating OXC.  Thus, finer granularity\n   identification of\
    \ termination points is of relevance only to the\n   terminating OXC and not to\
    \ intermediate OXCs (of course, resource\n   allocation at each intermediate point\
    \ would depend on the granularity\n   of resources requested).  This suggests\
    \ an identification scheme\n   whereby OXCs are identified by a unique IP address\
    \ and a \"selector\"\n   identifies further fine-grain information of relevance\
    \ at an OXC.\n   This, of course, does not preclude the identification of these\n\
    \   termination points directly with IP addresses(with a null selector).\n   The\
    \ selector can be formatted to have adequate number of bits and a\n   structure\
    \ that expresses port, channel, sub-channel, etc,\n   identification.\n   Within\
    \ the optical network, the establishment of trail segments\n   between adjacent\
    \ OXCs require the identification of specific port,\n   channel, sub-channel,\
    \ etc.  With a GMPLS control plane, a label\n   serves this function.  The structure\
    \ of the label must be such that\n   it can encode the required information [10].\n\
    \   Another entity that must be identified is the SRLG [11].  An SRLG is\n   an\
    \ identifier assigned to a group of optical links that share a\n   physical resource.\
    \  For instance, all optical channels routed over\n   the same fiber could belong\
    \ to the same SRLG.  Similarly, all fibers\n   routed over a conduit could belong\
    \ to the same SRLG.  The notable\n   characteristic of SRLGs is that a given link\
    \ could belong to more\n   than   one SRLG, and two links belonging to a given\
    \ SRLG may\n   individually belong to two other SRLGs.  This is illustrated in\n\
    \   Figure 6.  Here, the   links 1,2,3 and 4 may belong to SRLG 1, links\n   1,2\
    \ and 3 could belong to SRLG 2 and link 4 could belong to SRLG 3.\n   Similarly,\
    \ links 5 and 6 could belong to SRLG 1, and links 7 and 8\n   could belong to\
    \ SRLG 4.  (In this example, the same SRLG, i.e., 1,\n   contains links from two\
    \ different adjacencies).\n   While the classification of physical resources into\
    \ SRLGs is a manual\n   operation, the assignment of unique identifiers to these\
    \ SRLGs\n   within an optical network is essential to ensure correct SRLG-\n \
    \  disjoint path computation for protection.  SRLGs could be identified\n   with\
    \ a flat identifier (e.g., 32 bit integer).\n   Finally, optical links between\
    \ adjacent OXCs may be bundled for\n   advertisement into a link state protocol\
    \ [12].  A bundled interface\n   may be numbered or unnumbered.  In either case,\
    \ the component links\n   within the bundle must be identifiable.  In concert\
    \ with SRLG\n   identification, this information is necessary for correct path\n\
    \   computation.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Neighbor Discovery
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Neighbor Discovery\n   Routing within the optical network relies on knowledge\
    \ of network\n   topology and resource availability.  This information may be\
    \ gathered\n   and used by a centralized system, or by a distributed link state\n\
    \   routing protocol.  In either case, the first step towards network-\n   wide\
    \ link state determination is the discovery of the status of local\n   links to\
    \ all neighbors by each OXC.  Specifically, each OXC must\n   determine the up/down\
    \ status of each optical link, the bandwidth and\n   other parameters of the link,\
    \ and the identity of the remote end of\n   the link (e.g., remote port number).\
    \  The last piece of information\n   is used to specify an appropriate label when\
    \ signaling for lightpath\n   provisioning.  The determination of these parameters\
    \ could be based\n   on a combination of manual configuration and an automated\
    \ protocol\n   running between adjacent OXCs.  The characteristics of such a\n\
    \   protocol would depend on the type of OXCs that are adjacent (e.g.,\n   transparent\
    \ or opaque).\n   Neighbor discovery would typically require in-band communication\
    \ on\n   the bearer channels to determine local connectivity and link status.\n\
    \   In the case of opaque OXCs with SONET termination, one instance of a\n   neighbor\
    \ discovery protocol (e.g., LMP [2]) would run on each OXC\n   port, communicating\
    \ with the corresponding protocol instance at the\n   neighboring OXC.  The protocol\
    \ would utilize the SONET overhead bytes\n   to transmit the (configured) local\
    \ attributes periodically to the\n   neighbor.  Thus, two neighboring switches\
    \ can automatically determine\n   the identities of each other and the local connectivity,\
    \ and also\n   keep track of the up/down status of local links.  Neighbor discovery\n\
    \   with transparent OXCs is described in [2].\n   +--------------+          +------------+\

  - "6.3.  Topology Discovery\n   Topology discovery is the procedure by which the\
    \ topology and\n   resource state of all the links in a network are determined.\
    \  This\n   procedure may be done as part of a link state routing protocol (e.g.,\n\
    \   OSPF, ISIS), or it can be done via the management plane (in the case\n   of\
    \ centralized path computation).  The implementation of a link state\n   protocol\
    \ within a network (i.e., across sub-network boundaries) means\n   that the same\
    \ protocol runs in OXCs in every sub-network.  If this\n   assumption does not\
    \ hold then interworking of routing between sub-\n   networks is required.  This\
    \ is similar to inter-network routing\n   discussed in Section 6.7.  The focus\
    \ in the following is therefore on\n   standardized link state routing.\n   In\
    \ general, most of the link state routing functionality is\n   maintained when\
    \ applied to optical networks.  However, the\n   representation of optical links,\
    \ as well as some link parameters, are\n   changed in this setting.  Specifically,\n\
    \   o  The link state information may consist of link bundles [12]. Each\n   \
    \   link bundle is represented as an abstract link in the network\n      topology.\
    \  Different bundling representations are possible.  For\n      instance, the\
    \ parameters of the abstract link may include the\n      number, bandwidth and\
    \ the type of optical links contained in the\n      underlying link bundle [12].\
    \  Also, the SRLGs corresponding to\n      each optical link in the bundle may\
    \ be included as a parameter.\n   o  The link state information should capture\
    \ restoration-related\n      parameters for optical links.  Specifically, with\
    \ shared\n      protection (Section 6.5), the link state updates must have\n \
    \     information that allows the computation of shared protection\n      paths.\n\
    \   o  A single routing adjacency could be maintained between neighbors\n    \
    \  which may have multiple optical links (or even multiple link\n      bundles)\
    \ between them.  This reduces the protocol messaging\n      overhead.\n   o  Since\
    \ link availability information changes dynamically, a\n      flexible policy\
    \ for triggering link state updates based on\n      availability thresholds may\
    \ be implemented.  For instance, changes\n      in availability of links of a\
    \ given bandwidth (e.g., OC-48) may\n      trigger updates only after the availability\
    \ figure changes by a\n      certain percentage.\n   These concepts are relatively\
    \ well-understood.  On the other hand,\n   the resource representation models\
    \ and the topology discovery process\n   for hierarchical routing (e.g., OSPF\
    \ with multiple areas) are areas\n   that need further work.\n"
- title: 6.4.  Protection and Restoration Models
  contents:
  - "6.4.  Protection and Restoration Models\n   Automatic restoration of lightpaths\
    \ is a service offered by optical\n   networks.  There could be local and end-to-end\
    \ mechanisms for\n   restoration of lightpaths within a network (across the INNI).\
    \  Local\n   mechanisms are used to select an alternate link (or network segment)\n\
    \   between two OXCs across the INNI when a failure affects the primary\n   link\
    \ (or primary network segment) over which the (protected)\n   lightpath is routed.\
    \  Local restoration does not affect the end-to-\n   end route of the lightpath.\
    \  When local restoration is not possible\n   (e.g., no alternate link is available\
    \ between the adjacent OXCs in\n   question), end-to-end restoration may be performed.\
    \  Under this\n   scenario this, the affected lightpath may be rerouted over an\n\
    \   alternate diverse path to circumvent failed resources.  For end-to-\n   end\
    \ restoration, alternate paths may be pre-computed to expedite the\n   recovery\
    \ time.  End to end restoration may also be mixed with local\n   recovery in various\
    \ ways depending on acceptable tradeoffs between\n   utilization of network resources\
    \ and recovery times.\n   End-to-end protection may be based on two types of protection\n\
    \   schemes; \"1 + 1\" protection or shared protection.  Under 1 + 1\n   protection,\
    \ a back-up path is established for the protected primary\n   path along a physically\
    \ diverse route.  Both paths are active and the\n   failure along the primary\
    \ path results in an immediate switch-over to\n   the back-up path.  Under shared\
    \ protection, back-up paths\n   corresponding to physically diverse primary paths\
    \ may share the same\n   network resources.  When a failure affects a primary\
    \ path, it is\n   assumed that the same failure will not affect the other primary\
    \ paths\n   whose back-ups share resources.\n   It is possible that different\
    \ restoration schemes may be implemented\n   within optical sub-networks.  It\
    \ is therefore necessary to consider a\n   two-level restoration mechanism.  Path\
    \ failures within an optical\n   sub-network could be handled using procedures\
    \ specific to the sub-\n   network.  If this fails, end-to-end restoration across\
    \ sub-networks\n   could be invoked.  The border OXC that is the ingress to a\
    \ sub-\n   network can act as the source for restoration procedures within a\n\
    \   sub-network.  The signaling for invoking end-to-end restoration\n   across\
    \ the INNI is described in Section 6.6.3.  The computation of\n   the back-up\
    \ path for end-to-end restoration may be based on various\n   criteria.  It is\
    \ assumed that the back-up path is computed by the\n   source OXC, and signaled\
    \ using standard methods.\n"
- title: 6.5.  Route Computation
  contents:
  - "6.5.  Route Computation\n   The computation of a primary route for a lightpath\
    \ within an optical\n   network is essentially a constraint-based routing problem.\
    \  The\n   constraint is typically the bandwidth required for the lightpath,\n\
    \   perhaps along with administrative and policy constraints.  The\n   objective\
    \ of path computation could be to minimize the total capacity\n   required for\
    \ routing lightpaths [13].\n   Route computation with constraints may be accomplished\
    \ using a number\n   of algorithms [14].  When 1+1 protection is used, a back-up\
    \ path that\n   does not traverse on any link which is part of the same SRLG as\
    \ links\n   in the primary path must be computed.  Thus, it is essential that\
    \ the\n   SRLGs in the primary path be known during alternate path computation,\n\
    \   along with the availability of resources in links that belong to\n   other\
    \ SRLGs.  This requirement has certain implications on optical\n   link bundling.\
    \  Specifically, a bundled LSA must include adequate\n   information such that\
    \ a remote OXC can determine the resource\n   availability under each SRLG that\
    \ the bundled link refers to, and the\n   relationship between links belonging\
    \ to different SRLGs in the\n   bundle.  For example, considering Figure 3, if\
    \ links 1,2,3 and 4 are\n   bundled together in an LSA, the bundled LSA must indicate\
    \ that there\n   are three SRLGs which are part of the bundle (i.e., 1, 2 and\
    \ 3), and\n   that links in SRLGs 2 and 3 are also part of SRLG 1.\n   To encode\
    \ the SRLG relationships in a link bundle LSA, only links\n   which belong to\
    \ exactly the same set of SRLGs must be bundled\n   together.  With reference\
    \ to Figure 3, for example, two bundles can\n   be advertised for links between\
    \ OXC1 and OXC2, with the following\n   information:\n   Bundle No.     SRLGs\
    \    Link Type   Number   Other Info\n   -------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \     1             1,2       OC-48       3          ---\n     2             1,3\
    \       OC-192      1          ---\n   Assuming that the above information is\
    \ available for each bundle at\n   every node, there are several approaches possible\
    \ for path\n   computation.  For instance,\n   1. The primary path can be computed\
    \ first, and the (exclusive or\n      shared) back-up is computed next based on\
    \ the SRLGs chosen for the\n      primary path.  In this regard,\n      o  The\
    \ primary path computation procedure can output a series of\n         bundles\
    \ the path  is routed over.  Since a bundle is uniquely\n         identified with\
    \ a set of SRLGs, the alternate path can be\n         computed right away based\
    \ on this knowledge.  In this case, if\n         the primary path set up does\
    \ not succeed for lack of resources\n         in a chosen bundle, the primary\
    \ and backup paths must be\n         recomputed.\n      o  It might be desirable\
    \ to compute primary paths without choosing\n         a specific bundle apriori.\
    \  That is, resource availability over\n         all bundles between a node pair\
    \ is taken into account rather\n         than specific bundle information.  In\
    \ this case, the primary\n         path computation procedure would output a series\
    \ of nodes the\n         path traverses.  Each OXC in the path would have the\
    \ freedom to\n         choose the particular bundle to route that segment of the\n\
    \         primary path.  This procedure would increase the chances of\n      \
    \   successfully setting up the primary path when link state\n         information\
    \ is not up to date everywhere.  But the specific\n         bundle chosen, and\
    \ hence the SRLGs in the primary path, must be\n         captured during primary\
    \ path set-up, for example, using the\n         RSVP-TE Route Record Object [15].\
    \  This SRLG information is\n         then used for computing the back-up path.\
    \  The back-up path may\n         also be established specifying only which SRLGs\
    \ to avoid in a\n         given segment, rather than which bundles to use.  This\
    \ would\n         maximize the chances of establishing the back-up path.\n   2.\
    \ The primary path and the back-up path are computed together in one\n      step,\
    \ for example, using Suurbaale's algorithm [16].  In this\n      case, the paths\
    \ must be computed using specific bundle\n      information.\n   To summarize,\
    \ it is essential to capture sufficient information in\n   link bundle LSAs to\
    \ accommodate different path computation procedures\n   and to maximize the chances\
    \ of successful path establishment.\n   Depending on the path computation procedure\
    \ used, the type of support\n   needed during path establishment (e.g., the recording\
    \ of link group\n   or SRLG information during path establishment) may differ.\n\
    \   When shared protection is used, the route computation algorithm must\n   take\
    \ into account the possibility of sharing links among multiple\n   back-up paths.\
    \  Under shared protection, the back-up paths\n   corresponding to SRLG-disjoint\
    \ primary paths can be assigned the same\n   links.  The assumption here is that\
    \ since the primary paths are not\n   routed over links that have the same SRLG,\
    \ a given failure will\n   affect only one of them.  Furthermore, it is assumed\
    \ that multiple\n   failure events affecting links belonging to more than one\
    \ SRLG will\n   not occur concurrently.  Unlike the case of 1+1 protection, the\n\
    \   back-up paths are not established apriori.  Rather, a failure event\n   triggers\
    \ the establishment of a single back-up path corresponding to\n   the affected\
    \ primary path.\n   The distributed implementation of route computation for shared\
    \ back-\n   up paths require knowledge about the routing of all primary and\n\
    \   back-up paths at every node.  This raises scalability concerns.  For\n   this\
    \ reason, it may be practical to consider the centralization of\n   the route\
    \ computation algorithm in a route server that has complete\n   knowledge of the\
    \ link state and path routes.  Heuristics for fully\n   distributed route computation\
    \ without complete knowledge of path\n   routes are to be determined.  Path computation\
    \ for restoration is\n   further described in [11].\n"

    \ for optical\n   paths may be autonomously initiated by different nodes, it is\n\
    \   possible   that two path set-up attempts are in progress at the same\n   time.\

  - "6.6.3.  Restoration\n   Signaling for restoration has two distinct phases.  There\
    \ is a\n   reservation phase in which capacity for the protection path is\n  \
    \ established.  Then, there is an activation phase in which the back-up\n   path\
    \ is actually put in service.  The former phase typically is not\n   subject to\
    \ strict time constraints, while the latter is.\n   Signaling to establish a \"\
    1+1\" back-up path is relatively straight-\n   forward.  This signaling is very\
    \ similar to signaling used for\n   establishing the primary path.  Signaling\
    \ to establish a shared\n   back-up path is a little bit different.  Here, each\
    \ OXC must\n   understand which back-up paths can share resources among themselves.\n\
    \   The signaling message must itself indicate shared reservation.  The\n   sharing\
    \ rule is as described in Section 6.4: back-up paths\n   corresponding to physically\
    \ diverse primary paths may share the same\n   network resources.  It may therefore\
    \ be necessary for the signaling\n   message to carry adequate information that\
    \ allows an OXC to verify\n   that appropriateness of having a set of back-up\
    \ paths sharing\n   certain.\n   Under both 1+1 and shared protection, the activation\
    \ phase has two\n   parts: propagation of failure information to the source OXC\
    \ from the\n   point of failure, and activation of the back-up path.  The signaling\n\
    \   for these two phases must be very fast in order to realize response\n   times\
    \ in the order of tens of milliseconds.  When optical links are\n   SONET-based,\
    \ in-band signals may be used, resulting in expedited\n   response.  With out-of-band\
    \ control, it may be necessary to consider\n   fast signaling over the control\
    \ channel using very short IP packets\n   and prioritized processing.  While it\
    \ is possible to use RSVP or CR-\n   LDP for activating protection paths, these\
    \ protocols do not provide\n   any means to give priority to restoration signaling\
    \ as opposed to\n   signaling for provisioning.  For instance, it is possible\
    \ for a\n   restoration-related RSVP message to be queued behind a number of\n\
    \   provisioning messages thereby delaying restoration.  It may therefore\n  \
    \ be necessary to develop a notion of prioritization for restoration\n   signaling\
    \ and incorporate appropriate mechanisms into existing\n   signaling protocols\
    \ to achieve this.  Alternatively, a new signaling\n   mechanism may be developed\
    \ exclusively for activating protection\n   paths during restoration.\n"

    \ conversions.  Such conversions have\n   the added benefit of permitting 3R regeneration.\
    \  The 3Rs refer to\n   re-power, signal retiming and reshaping.  Unfortunately,\
    \ this\n   regeneration requires that the underlying optical equipment be aware\n\

- title: 8.  Evolution Path for IP over Optical Architecture
  contents:
  - "8.  Evolution Path for IP over Optical Architecture\n   The architectural models\
    \ described in Section 5 imply a certain\n   degree of implementation complexity.\
    \  Specifically, the overlay model\n   was described as the least complex for\
    \ near term deployment and the\n   peer model the most complex.  Nevertheless,\
    \ each model has certain\n   advantages and this raises the question as to the\
    \ evolution path for\n   IP over optical network architectures.\n   The evolution\
    \ approach recommended in this framework is the\n   definition of capability sets\
    \ that start with simpler functionality\n   in the beginning and include more\
    \ complex functionality later.  In\n   this regard, it is realistic to expect\
    \ that initial IP over optical\n   deployments will be based on the domain services\
    \ model (with overlay\n   interconnection), with no routing exchange between the\
    \ IP and optical\n   domains.  Under this model, direct signaling between IP routers\
    \ and\n   optical networks is likely to be triggered by offline traffic\n   engineering\
    \ decisions.  The next step in the evolution of IP-optical\n   interaction is\
    \ the introduction of reachability information exchange\n   between the two domains.\
    \  This would potentially allow lightpaths to\n   be established as part of end-to-end\
    \ LSP set-up.  The final phase is\n   the support for the full peer model with\
    \ more sophisticated routing\n   interaction between IP and optical domains.\n\
    \   Using a common signaling framework (based on GMPLS) from the\n   beginning\
    \ facilitates this type of evolution.  In this evolution, the\n   signaling capability\
    \ and semantics at the IP-optical boundary would\n   become more sophisticated,\
    \ but the basic structure of signaling would\n   remain.  This would allow incremental\
    \ developments as the\n   interconnection model becomes more sophisticated, rather\
    \ than\n   complete re-development of signaling capabilities.\n   From a routing\
    \ point of view, the use of Network Management Systems\n   (NMS) for static connection\
    \ management is prevalent in legacy optical\n   networks.  Going forward, it can\
    \ be expected that connection routing\n   using the control plane will be gradually\
    \ introduced and integrated\n   into operational infrastructures.  The introduction\
    \ of routing\n   capabilities can be expected to occur in a phased approach.\n\
    \   It is likely that in the first phase, service providers will either\n   upgrade\
    \ existing local element management (EMS) software with\n   additional control\
    \ plane capabilities (and perhaps the hardware as\n   well), or upgrade the NMS\
    \ software in order to introduce some degree\n   of automation within each optical\
    \ subnetwork.  For this reason, it\n   may be desirable to partition the network\
    \ into subnetworks and\n   introduce IGP interoperability within each subnetwork\
    \ (i.e., at the\n   I-NNI level), and employ either static or signaled interoperability\n\
    \   between subnetworks.  Consequently, it can be envisioned that the\n   first\
    \ phase in the evolution towards network level control plane\n   interoperability\
    \ in IP over Optical networks will be organized around\n   a system of optical\
    \ subnetworks which are interconnected statically\n   (or dynamically in a signaled\
    \ configuration).  During this phase, an\n   overlay interconnection model will\
    \ be used between the optical\n   network itself and external IP and MPLS routers\
    \ (as described in\n   Section 5.2.3).\n   Progressing with this phased approach\
    \ to IPO routing\n   interoperabibility evolution, the next level of integration\
    \ will be\n   achieved when a single carrier provides dynamic optical routing\n\
    \   interoperability between subnetworks and between domains.  In order\n   to\
    \ become completely independent of the network switching capability\n   within\
    \ subnetworks and across domains, routing information exchange\n   may need to\
    \ be enabled at the UNI level.  This would constitute a\n   significant evolution:\
    \ even if the routing instances are kept\n   separate and independent, it would\
    \ still be possible to dynamically\n   exchange reachability and other types of\
    \ routing information. Another\n   more sophisticated step during this phase is\
    \ to introduce dynamic\n   routing at the E-NNI level.  This means that any neighboring\
    \ networks\n   (independent of internal switching capability) would be capable\
    \ of\n   exchanging routing information with peers across the E-NNI.\n   Another\
    \ alternative would be for private networks to bypass these\n   intermediate steps\
    \ and directly consider an integrated routing model\n   from the onset.  This\
    \ direct evolution strategy is realistic, but is\n   more likely to occur in operational\
    \ contexts where both the IP (or\n   MPLS) and optical networks are built simultaneously,\
    \ using equipment\n   from a single source or from multiple sources that are closely\n\
    \   affiliated.  In any case, due to the current lack of operational\n   experience\
    \ in managing this degree of control plane interaction in a\n   heterogeneous\
    \ network (these issues may exist even if the hardware\n   and software originate\
    \ from the same vendor), an augmented model is\n   likely to be the most viable\
    \ initial option.  Alternatively, a very\n   modular or hierarchical peer model\
    \ may be contemplated.  There may be\n   other challenges (not just of a technical,\
    \ but also administrative\n   and even political issues) that may need to be resolved\
    \ in order to\n   achieve full a peer model at the routing level in a multi-technology\n\
    \   and multi-vendor environment.  Ultimately, the main technical\n   improvement\

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   The architectural framework described in this\
    \ document requires a\n   number of different protocol mechanisms for its realization.\n\
    \   Specifically, the role of neighbor discovery, routing, and signaling\n   protocols\
    \ were highlighted in previous sections.  The general\n   security issues that\
    \ arise with these protocols include:\n   o  The authentication of entities exchanging\
    \ information (e.g.,\n      signaling, routing, or link management) across a control\n\
    \      interface;\n   o  Ensuring the integrity of the information exchanged across\
    \ the\n      interface;\n   o  Protection of the control mechanisms from intrusions\
    \ and other\n      modes of outside interference.\n   Because optical connections\
    \ may carry high volumes of traffic and are\n   generally quite expensive, mechanisms\
    \ are required to safeguard\n   optical networks against intrusions and unauthorized\
    \ utilization of\n   network resources.\n   In addition to the security aspects\
    \ relating to the control plane,\n   the data plane must also be protected from\
    \ external interference.\n   An important consideration in optical networks is\
    \ the separation of\n   control channels from data channels.  This decoupling\
    \ implies that\n   the state of the bearer channels carrying user traffic cannot\
    \ be\n   inferred from the state of the control channels.  Similarly, the\n  \
    \ state of the control channels cannot be inferred from the state of\n   the data\
    \ channels.  The potential security implications of this\n   decoupling should\
    \ be taken into account in the design of pertinent\n   control protocols and in\
    \ the operation of IPO networks.\n   Another issue in IPO networks concerns the\
    \ fact that the underlying\n   optical network elements may be invisible to IP\
    \ client nodes,\n   especially in the overlay model.  This means that traditional\
    \ IP\n   tools such as traceroute cannot be used by client IP nodes to detect\n\
    \   attacks within the optical domain.\n   For the aforementioned reasons, the\
    \ output of the routing protocol\n   security (RPSEC) efforts within the IETF\
    \ should be considered in the\n   design of control protocols for optical networks.\n\
    \   In Section 2, the concept of a trust domain was defined as a network\n   under\
    \ a single technical administration in which adequate security\n   measures are\
    \ established to prevent unauthorized intrusion from\n   outside the domain. \
    \ It should be strongly noted that within a trust\n   domain, any subverted node\

    \ messages is also desirable, especially\n   in scenarios where message attributes\
    \ between communicating entities\n   include sensitive or private information.\
    \  Examples of such\n   attributes include account numbers, contract identification\n\
    \   information, and similar types of private data.\n   The case of equipment\
    \ that are not co-located presents increased\n   security threats.  In such scenarios,\
    \ the communicating entities\n   engaged in protocol message transactions may\
    \ be connected over an\n   external network.  Generally, the external network\
    \ may be outside the\n   span of control of the optical network (or client IP\
    \ network)\n   administrators.  As a result, the protocol messages may be subject\
    \ to\n   increased security threats, such as address spoofing, eavesdropping,\n\
    \   and intrusion.  To mitigate such threats, appropriate security\n   mechanisms\
    \ must be employed to protect the control channels and\n   associated signaling\
    \ and routing messages.\n   Requests for optical connections from client networks\
    \ must also be\n   filtered using appropriate policies to protect against security\n\
    \   infringements and excess resource consumption.  Additionally, there\n   may\
    \ be a need for confidentiality of SRLGs in some circumstances.\n   Optical networks\
    \ may also be subject to subtle forms of denial of\n   service attacks.  An example\
    \ of this would be requests for optical\n   connections with explicit routes that\
    \ induce a high degree of\n   blocking for subsequent requests.  This aspect might\
    \ require some\n   global coordination of resource allocation.\n   Another related\
    \ form of subtle denial of service attack could occur\n   when improbable optical\
    \ paths are requested (i.e., paths within the\n   network for which resources\
    \ are insufficiently provisioned).  Such\n   requests for improbable paths may\
    \ consume ports on optical switching\n   elements within the network resulting\
    \ in denial of service for\n   subsequent connection requests.\n"

  - "9.2.  Security Considerations for Protocol Mechanisms\n   The security requirements\
    \ for IP-centric control protocols employed\n   in the control plane of optical\
    \ networks would depend on the specific\n   characteristics of the protocols and\
    \ the security risks that exist in\n   a particular operational context.  Such\
    \ details relating to\n   particular operational contexts are beyond the scope\
    \ of this document\n   and hence are not considered further.  Nevertheless, it\
    \ must be\n   stated that such control protocols must take into account the issues\n\
    \   associated with the separation of control channels from data channels\n  \
    \ in switched optical networks, and the magnitude and extent of service\n   interruptions\
    \  within the IP domain that could result from outages\n   emanating from the\
    \ optical domain.\n"
- title: 10.  Summary and Conclusions
  contents:
  - "10.  Summary and Conclusions\n   The objective of this document was to define\
    \ a framework for IP over\n   optical networks, considering the service models,\
    \ and routing and\n   signaling issues.  There are a diversity of choices for\
    \ IP-optical\n   control interconnection, service models, and protocol mechanisms.\
    \ The\n   approach advocated in this document was to support different service\n\
    \   models which allow for future enhancements, and define complementary\n   signaling\
    \ and routing mechanisms to enable these capabilities.  An\n   evolutionary scenario,\
    \ based on a common signaling framework (e.g.,\n   based on GMPLS) was suggested,\
    \ with the capability to increase the\n   complexity of interworking functionality\
    \ as the requirements become\n   more sophisticated.  A key aspect of this evolutionary\
    \ principle is\n   that the IP-optical control and service interaction is first\
    \ based on\n   the domain services model with overlay interconnection that will\n\
    \   eventually evolve to support full peer interaction.\n"
