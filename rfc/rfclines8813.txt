Abstract This document updates RFC 5480 to specify semantics for the keyEncipherment and dataEncipherment key usage bits when used in certificates that support Elliptic Curve Cryptography.
Introduction [RFC5480] specifies the syntax and semantics for the Subject Public Key Information field in certificates that support Elliptic Curve Cryptography.
As part of these semantics, it defines what combinations are permissible for the values of the key usage extension [RFC5280].
[RFC5480] specifies 7 of the 9 values; it makes no mention of the keyEncipherment and dataEncipherment key usage bits.
This document corrects this omission by updating Section 3 of [RFC5480] to make it clear that neither keyEncipherment nor the dataEncipherment key usage bits are set for key agreement algorithms defined therein.
The additions are to be made to the end of Section 3 of [RFC5480].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
If the keyUsage extension is present in a certificate that indicates id ecPublicKey in SubjectPublicKeyInfo, then the following values MUST NOT be present: keyEncipherment; and dataEncipherment.
If the keyUsage extension is present in a certificate that indicates id ecDH or id ecMQV in SubjectPublicKeyInfo, then the following values also MUST NOT be present: keyEncipherment; and dataEncipherment.
This document introduces no new security considerations beyond those found in [RFC5480].
This document has no IANA actions.
