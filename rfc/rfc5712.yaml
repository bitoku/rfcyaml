  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic\n
    \  Engineering Soft Preemption, a suite of protocol modifications\n   extending
    the concept of preemption with the goal of reducing or\n   eliminating traffic
    disruption of preempted Traffic Engineering Label\n   Switched Paths (TE LSPs).
    \ Initially, MPLS RSVP-TE was defined with\n   support for only immediate TE LSP
    displacement upon preemption.  The\n   utilization of a reroute request notification
    helps more gracefully\n   mitigate the reroute process of preempted TE LSP.  For
    the brief\n   period soft preemption is activated, reservations (though not\n
    \  necessarily traffic levels) are in effect under-provisioned until the\n   TE
    LSP(s) can be rerouted.  For this reason, the feature is\n   primarily, but not
    exclusively, interesting in MPLS-enabled IP\n   networks with Differentiated Services
    and Traffic Engineering\n   capabilities.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   In a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Resource Reservation\n
    \  Protocol Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) (see [RFC3209]) enabled IP\n   network,
    hard preemption is the default behavior.  Hard preemption\n   provides no mechanism
    to allow preempted Traffic Engineering Label\n   Switched Paths (TE LSPs) to be
    handled in a make-before-break\n   fashion: the hard preemption scheme instead
    utilizes a very intrusive\n   method that can cause traffic disruption for a potentially
    large\n   amount of TE LSPs.  Without an alternative, network operators either\n
    \  accept this limitation, or remove functionality by using only one\n   preemption
    priority or using invalid bandwidth reservation values.\n   Understandably desirable
    features like TE reservation adjustments\n   that are automated by the ingress
    Label Edge Router (LER) are less\n   palatable when preemption is intrusive and
    maintaining high levels of\n   network stability levels is a concern.\n   This
    document defines the use of additional signaling and maintenance\n   mechanisms
    to alert the ingress LER of the preemption that is pending\n   and allow for temporary
    control-plane under-provisioning while the\n   preempted tunnel is rerouted in
    a non-disruptive fashion (make-\n   before-break) by the ingress LER.  During
    the period that the tunnel\n   is being rerouted, link capacity is under-provisioned
    on the midpoint\n   where preemption initiated and potentially one or more links
    upstream\n   along the path where other soft preemptions may have occurred.\n"

  - "3.  Motivations\n   Initially, MPLS RSVP-TE [RFC3209] was defined with support
    for only\n   one method of TE LSP preemption, which immediately tears down TE\n
    \  LSPs, disregarding the preempted in-transit traffic.  This simple but\n   abrupt
    process nearly guarantees preempted traffic will be discarded,\n   if only briefly,
    until the RSVP Path Error message reaches and is\n   processed by the ingress
    LER and a new data path can be established.\n   The Error Code and Error Values
    carried within the RSVP Path Error\n   message to report a preemption action are
    documented in [RFC5711].\n   Note that such preemption is also referred to as
    a fatal error in\n   [RFC5711].  In cases of actual resource contention this might
    be\n   helpful; however, preemption may be triggered by mere reservation\n   contention,
    and reservations may not reflect data-plane contention up\n   to the moment.  The
    result is that when conditions that promote\n   preemption exist and hard preemption
    is the default behavior,\n   inferior priority preempted traffic may be needlessly
    discarded when\n   sufficient bandwidth exists for both the preempted TE LSP and
    the\n   preempting TE LSP(s).\n   Hard preemption may be a requirement to protect
    numerically lower\n   preemption priority traffic in a non-Diffserv-enabled architecture,\n
    \  but in a Diffserv-enabled-architecture, one need not rely exclusively\n   upon
    preemption to enforce a preference for the most valued traffic\n   since the marking
    and queuing disciplines should already be aligned\n   for those purposes.  Moreover,
    even in non-Diffserv-aware networks,\n   depending on the TE LSP sizing rules
    (imagine all LSPs are sized at\n   double their observed traffic level), reservation
    contention may not\n   accurately reflect the potential for data-plane congestion.\n"

    and R4-R5 is 1 Gbit/s.\n   o  Reservable BW on R1-R2, R1-R4, R2-R3, and R3-R5
    is 155 Mbit/s.\n   o  Bandwidths and costs are identical in both directions.\n
    \  o  Each circuit has an IGP metric of 10, and the IGP metric is used\n      by
    CSPF.\n   o  Two TE tunnels are defined:\n      *  LSP1: 155 Mbit/s, setup/hold
    priority 0 tunnel, path R0-R1-R5.\n      *  LSP2: 155 Mbit/s, setup/hold priority
    7 tunnel, path R2-R1-R4.\n      Both TE LSPs are signaled with the \"Soft Preemption
    Desired\" bit\n      of their SESSION-ATTRIBUTE object set.\n   o  Circuit R1-R5
    fails.\n   o  Soft Preemption is functional.\n   When the circuit R1-R5 fails,
    R1 detects the failure and sends an\n   updated IGP LSA/LSP and Path Error message
    to all the head-end LSRs\n   that have a TE LSP traversing the failed link (R0
    in the example\n   above).  Either form of notification may arrive at the head-end
    LSRs\n   first.  Upon receiving the link failure notification, R0 triggers a\n
    \  TE LSP reroute of LSP1, and re-signals LSP1 along shortest path\n   available
    satisfying the TE LSP constraints: R0-R1-R4-R5 path.  The\n   Resv messages for
    LSP1 travel in the upstream direction (from the\n   destination to the head-end
    LSR -- R5 to R0 in this example).  LSP2\n   is soft preempted at R1 as it has
    a numerically lower priority value,\n   and both bandwidth reservations cannot
    be satisfied on the R1-R4\n   link.\n   Instead of sending a PathTear message
    for LSP2 upon preemption as\n   with hard preemption (which would result in an
    immediate traffic\n   disruption for LSP2), R1's local bandwidth accounting for
    LSP2 is\n   zeroed, and a PathErr message with error code \"Reroute\" and a value\n
    \  \"Reroute Request Soft Preemption\" for LSP2 is issued.\n   Upon reception
    of the PathErr message for LSP2, R2 may update the\n   working copy of the TE-DB
    before calculating a new path for the new\n   LSP.  In the case that Diffserv
    [RFC3270] and TE [RFC3209] are\n   deployed, receiving a \"preemption pending\"
    notification may imply to\n   a head-end LSR that the available bandwidth for
    the affected priority\n   level and numerically greater priority levels has been
    exhausted for\n   the indicated node interface.  R2 may choose to reduce or zero
    the\n   available bandwidth for the implied priority range until more\n   accurate
    information is available (i.e., a new IGP TE update is\n   received).  It follows
    that R2 re-computes a new path and performs a\n   non-traffic-disruptive rerouting
    of the new TE LSP T2 by means of the\n   make-before-break procedure.  The old
    path is then torn down.\n"

    - "6.1.  On a Soft Preempting LSR\n   When a new TE LSP is signaled that requires
      a set of TE LSP(s) to be\n   preempted because not all TE LSPs can be accommodated
      on a specific\n   interface, a node triggers a preemption action that consists
      of\n   selecting the set of TE LSPs that must be preempted so as to free up\n
      \  some bandwidth in order to satisfy the newly signaled numerically\n   lower
      preemption TE LSP.\n   With hard preemption, when a TE LSP is preempted, the
      preempting node\n   sends an RSVP PathErr message that serves as notification
      of a fatal\n   action as documented in [RFC5711].  Upon receiving the RSVP PathErr\n
      \  message, the head-end LSR sends an RSVP PathTear message, that would\n   result
      in an immediate traffic disruption for the preempted TE LSP.\n   By contrast,
      the mode of operation with soft preemption is as\n   follows: the preempting
      node's local bandwidth accounting for the\n   preempted TE LSP is zeroed and
      a PathErr with error code \"Reroute\",\n   and a error value \"Reroute Request
      Soft Preemption\" for that TE LSP\n   is issued upstream toward the head-end
      LSR.\n   If more than one soft preempted TE LSP has the same head-end LSR,\n
      \  these soft preemption PathErr notification messages may be bundled\n   together.\n
      \  The preempting node MUST immediately send a PathErr with error code\n   \"Reroute\"
      and a error value \"Reroute Request Soft Preemption\" for\n   each soft preempted
      TE LSP.  The node MAY use the occurrence of soft\n   preemption to trigger an
      immediate IGP update or influence the\n   scheduling of an IGP update.\n   To
      guard against a situation where bandwidth under-provisioning will\n   last forever,
      a local timer (named the \"Soft preemption timer\") MUST\n   be started on the
      preemption node upon soft preemption.  If this\n   timer expires, the preempting
      node SHOULD send an RSVP PathTear and\n   either a ResvTear message or a PathErr
      with the 'Path_State_Removed'\n   flag set.\n   Should a refresh event for a
      soft preempted TE LSP arrive before the\n   soft preemption timer expires, the
      soft preempting node MUST continue\n   to refresh the TE LSP.\n   When the MESSAGE-ID
      extensions defined in [RFC2961] are available and\n   enabled, PathErr messages
      with the error code \"Reroute\" and error\n   value \"Reroute Request Soft Preemption\"
      SHOULD be sent in reliable\n   mode.\n   The preempting node MAY preempt TE
      LSPs that have a numerically\n   higher Holding priority than the Setup priority
      of the newly admitted\n   LSP.  Within the same priority, first it SHOULD attempt
      to preempt\n   LSPs with the \"Soft Preemption Desired\" bit of the SESSION
      ATTRIBUTE\n   object cleared, i.e., the TE LSPs that are considered as Hard\n
      \  Preemptable.\n   Selection of the preempted TE LSP at a preempting midpoint:
      when a\n   numerically lower priority TE LSP is signaled that requires the\n
      \  preemption of a set of numerically higher priority LSPs, the node\n   where
      preemption is to occur has to make a decision on the set of TE\n   LSP(s) that
      are candidates for preemption.  This decision is a local\n   decision and various
      algorithms can be used, depending on the\n   objective (e.g, see [RFC4829]).
      \ As already mentioned, soft\n   preemption causes a temporary link under-provisioning
      condition while\n   the soft preempted TE LSPs are rerouted by their respective
      head-end\n   LSRs.  In order to reduce this under-provisioning exposure, a soft\n
      \  preempting LSR MAY check first if there exists soft preemptable TE\n   LSP
      bandwidth that is flagged by another node but still available for\n   soft preemption
      locally.  If sufficient overlap bandwidth exists, the\n   LSR MAY attempt to
      soft preempt the same TE LSP.  This would help\n   reduce the temporarily elevated
      under-provisioning ratio on the links\n   where soft preemption occurs and reduce
      the number of preempted TE\n   LSPs.  Optionally, a midpoint LSR upstream or
      downstream from a soft\n   preempting node MAY choose to flag the TE LSPs in
      soft preempted\n   state.  In the event a local preemption is needed, the LSPs
      that are\n   in the cache and of the relevant priority level are soft preempted\n
      \  first, followed by the normal soft and hard preemption selection\n   process
      for the given priority.\n   Under specific circumstances such as unacceptable
      link congestion, a\n   node MAY decide to hard preempt a TE LSP (by sending
      a fatal Path\n   Error message, a PathTear, and either a ResvTear or a Path
      Error\n   message with the 'Path_State_Removed' flag set) even if its head-end\n
      \  LSR explicitly requested soft preemption (by setting the \"Soft\n   Preemption
      Desired\" flag of the corresponding SESSION-ATTRIBUTE\n   object).  Note that
      such a decision MAY also be made for TE LSPs\n   under soft preemption state.\n"

      the TE-DB before computing a new\n   path (e.g., by running CSPF) for the new

      are\n   deployed, receiving \"preemption pending\" may imply to a head-end LSR\n
      \  that the available bandwidth for the affected priority level and\n   numerically
      greater priority levels has been exhausted for the\n   indicated node interface.
      \ A head-end LSR MAY choose to reduce or\n   zero the available bandwidth for

      (i.e., a new IGP TE update is\n   received).\n   Once a new path has been computed,

  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not introduce new security
    issues.  The security\n   considerations pertaining to the original RSVP protocol
    [RFC3209]\n   remain relevant.  Further details about MPLS security considerations\n
    \  can be found in [SEC_FMWK].\n   As noted in Section 6.1, soft preemption may
    result in temporary link\n   under provisioning condition while the soft preempted
    TE LSPs are\n   rerouted by their respective head-end LSRs.  Although this is
    a less\n   serious condition than false hard preemption, and despite the\n   mitigation
    procedures described in Section 6.1, network operators\n   should be aware of
    the risk to their network in the case that the\n   soft preemption processes are
    subverted, and should apply the\n   relevant MPLS control plane security techniques
    to protect against\n   attacks.\n"
