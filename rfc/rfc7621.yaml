- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Experience since the publication of the most recent SIP Events\n\
    \   framework (in July 2012) has shown that there is room for\n   interpretation\
    \ around the use of Globally Routable User Agent URIs in\n   that specification.\
    \  This document clarifies the intended behavior.\n   This document updates RFC\
    \ 6665.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is intended to clarify a point of implementor\
    \ confusion\n   arising from lack of clarity in [RFC6665].\n"
- title: 2.  Clarification of GRUU Handling
  contents:
  - "2.  Clarification of GRUU Handling\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",\
    \ \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n   Section 4.5.1 of [RFC6665] contains the following normative\n\
    \   requirement on implementations:\n      Notifiers MUST implement the Globally\
    \ Routable User Agent URI\n      (GRUU) extension defined in [RFC5627], and MUST\
    \ use a GRUU as\n      their local target.  This allows subscribers to explicitly\
    \ target\n      desired devices.\n   The second sentence of this paragraph attempted\
    \ to set context for\n   the normative statement: the reason GRUUs are required\
    \ in this\n   context is to allow you to send SUBSCRIBE or REFER requests to a\n\
    \   specific user agent, with the target of the subscription request\n   being\
    \ something like an INVITE dialog on that device.  Consequently,\n   the requirement\
    \ to include a GRUU as a local target was intended to\n   apply not just to the\
    \ local target for SUBSCRIBE-created dialogs, but\n   to *all* dialogs, even those\
    \ created by INVITE.  This requirement has\n   been interpreted in a variety of\
    \ ways by implementors, so a\n   clarification is in order.\n   Discussion subsequent\
    \ to the publication of [RFC6665] has highlighted\n   obscure cases in which implementations\
    \ might be notifiers in some\n   contexts, but may not wish to act as notifiers\
    \ in others.  Under\n   these narrow circumstances, the restriction described\
    \ above is not\n   necessary for dialogs about which the notifier will never accept\n\
    \   subscriptions (although the use of GRUUs in such a context causes no\n   harm,\
    \ either).\n   This document updates [RFC6665] to clarify the actual requirements.\n\
    \   The replacement text is as follows:\n      Notifiers MUST implement the Globally\
    \ Routable User Agent URI\n      (GRUU) extension defined in [RFC5627].  Notifiers\
    \ MUST use a GRUU\n      as their local target for all dialog-forming methods\
    \ and all\n      target-refresh methods, except for those dialogs for which they\n\
    \      will reject all subscription requests (implicit or explicit).  For\n  \
    \    clarity: an implementation that uses a non-GRUU local contact\n      under\
    \ the exception described above MUST reject a request that\n      might create\
    \ a subscription to the associated dialog, regardless\n      of whether such subscription\
    \ would be created by a SUBSCRIBE or a\n      REFER message.  The rejection code\
    \ under such conditions SHOULD be\n      403 (Forbidden) unless some other code\
    \ is more appropriate to the\n      circumstances.  The foregoing requirements\
    \ to implement and use\n      GRUUs specifically include dialogs created by the\
    \ INVITE method.\n"
