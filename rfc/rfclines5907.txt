Abstract The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used in networks of all types and sizes for time synchronization of servers, workstations, and other networked equipment.
As time synchronization is more and more a mission critical service, standardized means for monitoring and management of this subsystem of a networked host are required to allow operators of such a service to set up a monitoring system that is platform  and vendor independent.
This document provides a standardized collection of data objects for monitoring the NTP entity of such a network participant and it is part of the NTP version 4 standardization effort.
The NTPv4 MIB module is designed to allow Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to be used to monitor and manage local NTP [RFC5905] entities.
It provides a collection of data objects that can be queried using the SNMP protocol and represent the current status of the NTP entity.
This includes general information about the NTP entity itself (vendor, product, version) as well as connectivity to upstream NTP servers used as sources of reference time and to hardware reference clocks like radio clocks.
The most important values are included in order to be able to detect failures before they can have an impact on the overall time synchronization status of the network.
There are also a collection of notification objects to inform about state changes in the NTP entity.
There are objects to control these notifications as well.

The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The NTPv4 MIB module is divided into sections for general server information, current NTP entity status, status information of all mobilized associations (e.g., unicast upstream time servers, multicast or broadcast, time references, and hardware clocks), NTP entity control objects, NTP objects used only for notifications, as well as SNMP notification definitions for core events.
The general server information section contains static information and can be queried to identify which NTP implementation is running on a host.
This includes the vendor and product name of the running NTP software as well as version information, hardware/os platform identity, and the time resolution of the underlying OS.
Section 2 (current NTP status) includes data objects that represent the current operational status of the NTP entity.
The third section contains data objects that represent the set of time references ("associations") with which the NTP entity is currently working.
The fourth section contains objects that can be used to control the NTP entity.
The currently defined objects control how often the heartbeat interval notification is sent out and which notifications are enabled.
The fifth section contains objects that are only used as varbinds in notifications.
There is currently only one object in this section   a message that adds a cleartext event message to notifications.
Certain important events can occur while the NTP entity is running.
The notification section defines SNMP notifications for a collection of the most important ones ("core events") and additionally provides a heartbeat notification as well as a test notification to allow management systems to test the reception of NTP related notifications as well as enable heartbeat based monitoring systems to assure that the NTP entity is still up and running.
Some values are included both in numeric and in human readable (string) format.
This has been done to simplify the representation of a status information.
If the two representations of a certain value differ, the numeric representation takes precedence.

The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:
{ mib 2 197 } 7.
There are currently two management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the objects and their sensitivity/ vulnerability: ntpEntHeartbeatInterval controls the interval of heartbeat notifications.
If set to 1, this will cause the NTP entity to send one notification each second.
This is the maximum rate (1/s) that can be generated automatically.
If it is set to 0, then one single hearbeat notification will be created and no further automatically generated notification is sent.
This functionality can be used to create notifications at a higher rate (as high as the object can be written).
Could be used to switch off notifications in order to delay or eliminate the notification for critical and important events.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: ntpEntSoftwareName, ntpEntSoftwareVersion, ntpEntSoftwareVendor, and ntpEntSystemType
all can be used to identify software and its version as well as the operating system and hardware platform.
This might help a potential attacker to find security problems and therefore can be used in the preparation of an attack.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see RFC 3410 [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
