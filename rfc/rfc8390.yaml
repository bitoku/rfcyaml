  - "Abstract\n   RSVP-TE provides support for the communication of exclusion\n   information
    during Label Switched Path (LSP) setup.  A typical LSP\n   diversity use case
    is for protection, where two LSPs should follow\n   different paths through the
    network in order to avoid single points\n   of failure, thus greatly improving
    service availability.  This\n   document specifies an approach that can be used
    for network scenarios\n   where the full path(s) is not necessarily known by use
    of an abstract\n   identifier for the path.  Three types of abstract identifiers
    are\n   specified: client based, Path Computation Element (PCE) based, and\n   network
    based.  This document specifies two new diversity subobjects\n   for the RSVP
    eXclude Route Object (XRO) and the Explicit Exclusion\n   Route Subobject (EXRS).\n
    \  For the protection use case, LSPs are typically created at a slow\n   rate
    and exist for a long time so that it is reasonable to assume\n   that a given
    (reference) path currently existing (with a well-known\n   identifier) will continue
    to exist and can be used as a reference\n   when creating the new diverse path.
    \ Re-routing of the existing\n   (reference) LSP, before the new path is established,
    is not\n   considered.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Path diversity for multiple connections is a well-known
    operational\n   requirement.  Diversity constraints ensure that Label Switched
    Paths\n   (LSPs) can be established without sharing network resources, thus\n
    \  greatly reducing the probability of simultaneous connection failures.\n   The
    source node can compute diverse paths for LSPs when it has full\n   knowledge
    of the network topology and is permitted to signal an\n   Explicit Route Object
    (ERO).  However, there are scenarios where\n   different nodes perform path computations,
    and therefore there is a\n   need for relevant diversity constraints to be signaled
    to those\n   nodes.  These include (but are not limited to):\n   o  LSPs with
    loose hops in the Explicit Route Object, e.g., inter-\n      domain LSPs; and\n
    \  o  Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) User-Network\n      Interface
    (UNI), where the core node may perform path computation\n      [RFC4208].\n   [RFC4874]
    introduced a means of specifying nodes and resources to be\n   excluded from a
    route using the eXclude Route Object (XRO) and\n   Explicit Exclusion Route Subobject
    (EXRS).  It facilitates the\n   calculation of diverse paths for LSPs based on
    known properties of\n   those paths including addresses of links and nodes traversed
    and\n   Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs) of traversed links.  Employing these\n
    \  mechanisms requires that the source node that initiates signaling\n   knows
    the relevant properties of the path(s) from which diversity is\n   desired.  However,
    there are circumstances under which this may not\n   be possible or desirable,
    including (but not limited to):\n   o  Exclusion of a path that does not originate,
    terminate, or\n      traverse the source node of the diverse LSP, in which case
    the\n      addresses of links and SRLGs of the path from which diversity is\n
    \     required are unknown to the source node.\n   o  Exclusion of a path that
    is known to the source node of the\n      diverse LSP for which the node has incomplete
    or no path\n      information, e.g., due to operator policy.  In this case, the\n
    \     source node is aware of the existence of the reference path, but\n      the
    information required to construct an XRO object to guarantee\n      diversity
    from the reference path is not fully known.  Inter-\n      domain and GMPLS overlay
    networks can impose such restrictions.\n   This is illustrated in Figure 1, where
    the overlay reference model\n   from [RFC4208] is shown.\n      Overlay                                                  Overlay\n

    \ EN  -  Edge Node\n                                  CN  -  Core Node\n                Figure
    1: Overlay Reference Model [RFC4208]\n   Figure 1 depicts two types of UNI connectivity:
    single-homed and\n   dual-homed ENs (which also applies to higher-order multihomed\n
    \  connectivity).  Single-homed EN devices are connected to a single CN\n   device
    via a single UNI link.  This single UNI link may constitute a\n   single point
    of failure.  UNI connection between EN1 and CN1 is an\n   example of singled-homed
    UNI connectivity.\n   Such a single point of failure can be avoided when the EN
    device is\n   connected to two different CN devices, as depicted for EN2 in\n
    \  Figure 1.  For the dual-homing case, it is possible to establish two\n   different
    UNI connections from the same source EN device to the same\n   destination EN
    device.  For example, two connections from EN2 to EN3\n   may use the two UNI
    links EN2-CN1 and EN2-CN4.  To avoid single\n   points of failure within the provider
    network, it is necessary to\n   also ensure path (LSP) diversity within the core
    network.\n   In a network providing a set of UNI interfaces between ENs and CNs\n
    \  such as that shown in Figure 1, the CNs typically perform path\n   computation.
    \ Information sharing across the UNI boundary is\n   restricted based on the policy
    rules imposed by the core network.\n   Typically, the core network topology information
    as well as LSP path\n   information is not exposed to the ENs.  In the network
    shown in\n   Figure 1, consider a use case where an LSP from EN2 to EN4 needs
    to\n   be SRLG diverse from an LSP from EN1 to EN3.  In this case, EN2 may\n   not
    know SRLG attributes of the EN1-EN3 LSP and hence cannot\n   construct an XRO
    to exclude these SRLGs.  In this example, EN2 cannot\n   use the procedures described
    in [RFC4874].  Similarly, an LSP from\n   EN2 to EN3 traversing CN1 needs to be
    diverse from an LSP from EN2 to\n   EN3 going via CN4.  Again, in this case, exclusions
    based on\n   [RFC4874] cannot be used.\n   This document addresses these diversity
    requirements by introducing\n   an approach of excluding the path taken by these
    particular LSP(s).\n   Each reference LSP or route from which diversity is required
    is\n   identified by an abstract \"identifier\".  The type of identifier to\n
    \  use is highly dependent on the core network operator's networking\n   deployment
    scenario; it could be client initiated (provided by the\n   EN), provided by a
    PCE, or allocated by the (core) network.  This\n   document defines three different
    types of identifiers corresponding\n   to these three cases: a client-initiated
    identifier, a PCE-allocated\n   identifier, and an identifier allocated by the
    CN ingress node\n   (UNI-N), i.e., a network-assigned identifier.\n"

      by\n   Figure 1.  Suppose an LSP from EN2 to EN4 needs to be diverse with\n
      \  respect to an LSP from EN1 to EN3.\n   The LSP identifier of the EN1-EN3

    - "1.4.  PCE-Allocated Identifier\n   In scenarios where a PCE is deployed and
      used to perform path\n   computation, typically the ingress node of the core
      network (e.g.,\n   node CN1 in Figure 1) could consult a PCE to allocate identifiers,\n
      \  which are used to signal path diversity constraints.  In other\n   deployment
      scenarios, a PCE is deployed at a network node(s) or it is\n   part of a Network
      Management System (NMS).  In all these cases, the\n   PCE is consulted and the
      Path Key, as defined in [RFC5520], can be\n   used in RSVP signaling as the
      identifier to ensure diversity.\n   An example of specifying LSP diversity using
      a Path Key is shown in\n   Figure 2, where a simple network with two domains
      is shown.  It is\n   desired to set up a pair of path-disjoint LSPs from the
      source in\n   Domain 1 to the destination in Domain 2, but the domains keep
      strict\n   confidentiality about all path and topology information.\n   The
      first LSP is signaled by the source with ERO {A, B, loose Dst}\n   and is set
      up with the path {Src, A, B, U, V, W, Dst}.  However, when\n   sending the Record
      Route Object (RRO) out of Domain 2, node U would\n   normally strip the path
      and replace it with a loose hop to the\n   destination.  With this limited information,
      the source is unable to\n   include enough detail in the ERO of the second LSP
      to avoid it\n   taking, for example, the path {Src, C, D, X, V, W, Dst} for
      path-\n   disjointness.\n          ---------------------    -----------------------------\n

      2: A Simple Multi-domain Network\n   In order to support LSP diversity, node
      U consults the PCE and\n   replaces the path segment {U, V, W} in the RRO with
      a Path Key\n   subobject.  The PCE function assigns an \"identifier\" and puts
      it into\n   the Path Key field of the Path Key subobject.  The PCE ID in the\n
      \  message indicates that this replacement operation was performed by\n   node
      U.\n   With this additional information, the source node is able to signal\n
      \  the subsequent LSPs with the ERO set to {C, D, exclude Path Key\n   (signaled
      in the EXRS RSVP subobject), loose Dst}.  When the\n   signaling message reaches
      node X, it can consult the PCE function\n   associated with node U to expand
      the Path Key in order to calculate a\n   path that is diverse with respect to
      the first LSP.  Alternatively,\n   the source node could use an ERO of {C, D,
      loose Dst} and include an\n   XRO containing the Path Key.\n   This mechanism
      can work with all the Path Key resolution mechanisms,\n   as detailed in Section
      3.1 of [RFC5553].  A PCE, co-located or not,\n   may be used to resolve the
      Path Key, but the node (i.e., a Label\n   Switching Router (LSR)) can also use
      the Path Key information to\n   index a path segment previously supplied to
      it by the entity that\n   originated the Path Key (for example, the LSR that
      inserted the Path\n   Key in the RRO or a management system).\n"

    - "1.5.  Network-Assigned Identifier\n   There are scenarios in which the network
      provides diversity-related\n   information for a service that allows the client
      device to include\n   this information in the signaling message.  If the Shared
      Risk Link\n   Group (SRLG) identifier information is both available and shareable\n
      \  (by policy) with the ENs, the procedure defined in [RFC8001] can be\n   used
      to collect SRLG identifiers associated with an LSP (LSP1).  When\n   a second
      LSP (LSP2) needs to be diverse with respect to LSP1, the EN\n   constructing
      the RSVP signaling message for setting up LSP2 can\n   insert the SRLG identifiers
      associated with LSP1 as diversity\n   constraints into the XRO using the procedure
      described in [RFC4874].\n   However, if the core network SRLG identifiers are
      either not\n   available or not shareable with the ENs based on policies enforced
      by\n   the core network, existing mechanisms cannot be used.\n   In this document,
      a signaling mechanism is defined where information\n   signaled to the CN via
      the UNI does not require shared knowledge of\n   core network SRLG information.
      \ For this purpose, the concept of a\n   Path Affinity Set (PAS) is defined
      for abstracting SRLG information.\n   The motive behind the introduction of
      the PAS is to minimize the\n   exchange of diversity information between the
      core network (CNs) and\n   the client devices (ENs).  The PAS contains an abstract
      SRLG\n   identifier associated with a given path rather than a detailed SRLG\n
      \  list.  The PAS is a single identifier that can be used to request\n   diversity
      and associate diversity.  The means by which the processing\n   node determines
      the path corresponding to the PAS is beyond the scope\n   of this document.\n
      \  A CN on the core network boundary interprets the specific PAS\n   identifier
      (e.g., \"123\") as meaning to exclude the core network SRLG\n   information
      (or equivalent) that has been allocated by LSPs\n   associated with this PAS
      identifier value.  For example, if a path\n   exists for the LSP with the PAS
      identifier \"123\", the CN would use\n   local knowledge of the core network
      SRLGs associated with the LSPs\n   tagged with PAS attribute \"123\" and use
      those SRLGs as constraints\n   for path computation.  If a PAS identifier is
      used as an exclusion\n   identifier in the connection request, the CN (UNI-N)
      in the core\n   network is assumed to be able to determine the existing core
      network\n   SRLG information and calculate a path that meets the determined\n
      \  diversity constraints.\n   When a CN satisfies a connection setup for an
      SRLG-diverse signaled\n   path, the CN may optionally record the core network
      SRLG information\n   for that connection in terms of CN-based parameters and
      associate\n   that with the EN addresses in the Path message.  Specifically,
      for\n   Layer 1 Virtual Private Networks (L1VPNs), Port Information Tables\n
      \  (PITs) [RFC5251] can be leveraged to translate between client (EN)\n   addresses
      and core network addresses.\n   The means to distribute the PAS information
      within the core network\n   is beyond the scope of this document.  For example,
      the PAS and the\n   associated SRLG information can be distributed within the
      core\n   network by an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) or by other means such\n
      \  as configuration.  Regardless of means used to distribute the PAS\n   information,
      the information is kept inside the core network and is\n   not shared with the
      overlay network (see Figure 1).\n"

      \     The L flag is used in the same way as for the XRO subobjects\n      defined

      Flags (A-Flags):\n      The Attribute Flags (A-Flags) are used to communicate
      desirable\n      attributes of the LSP being signaled in the IPv4/IPv6 Diversity\n
      \     subobjects.  Each flag acts independently.  Any combination of\n      flags
      is permitted.\n      0x01 = Destination node exception\n         Indicates that
      the exclusion does not apply to the destination\n         node of the LSP being
      signaled.\n      0x02 = Processing node exception\n         Indicates that the
      exclusion does not apply to the node(s)\n         performing ERO expansion for
      the LSP being signaled.  An\n         ingress UNI-N node is an example of such
      a node.\n      0x04 = Penultimate node exception\n         Indicates that the
      penultimate node of the LSP being signaled\n         MAY be shared with the
      excluded path even when this violates\n         the exclusion flags.  This flag
      is useful, for example, when an\n         EN is not dual homed (like EN4 in
      Figure 1, where all LSPs have\n         to go through CN5).\n         The \"Penultimate
      node exception\" flag is typically set when the\n         destination node is
      single homed (e.g., EN1 or EN4 in\n         Figure 2).  In such a case, LSP
      diversity can only be\n         accomplished inside the core network up to the
      egress node and\n         the penultimate hop must be the same for the LSPs.\n
      \     0x08 = LSP ID to be ignored\n         This flag is used to indicate tunnel-level
      exclusion.\n         Specifically, this flag is used to indicate that if the\n
      \        diversity identifier contains an LSP ID field, then the LSP ID\n         is
      to be ignored, and the exclusion applies to any LSP matching\n         the rest
      of the diversity identifier.\n   Exclusion Flags (E-Flags):\n      The Exclusion
      Flags are used to communicate the desired type(s) of\n      exclusion requested
      in the IPv4/IPv6 Diversity subobjects.  The\n      following flags are defined.
      \ Any combination of these flags is\n      permitted.  Please note that the
      exclusion specified by these\n      flags may be modified by the value of the
      A-Flags.  For example,\n      the node exclusion flag is ignored for the penultimate
      node if the\n      \"Penultimate node exception\" flag of the A-Flags is set.\n
      \     0x01 = SRLG exclusion\n         Indicates that the path of the LSP being
      signaled is requested\n         to be SRLG disjoint with respect to the excluded
      path specified\n         by the IPv4/IPv6 Diversity XRO subobject.\n      0x02
      = Node exclusion\n         Indicates that the path of the LSP being signaled
      is requested\n         to be \"node diverse\" from the excluded path specified
      by the\n         IPv4/IPv6 Diversity XRO subobject.\n      0x04 = Link exclusion\n
      \        Indicates that the path of the LSP being signaled is requested\n         to
      be \"link diverse\" from the path specified by the IPv4/IPv6\n         Diversity
      XRO subobject.\n      0x08 = Reserved\n         This flag is reserved.  It MUST
      be set to zero on transmission\n         and MUST be ignored on receipt for
      both IPv4/IPv6 Diversity XRO\n         subobjects.\n   Resvd:\n      This field
      is reserved.  It MUST be set to zero on transmission\n      and MUST be ignored
      on receipt for both IPv4/IPv6 Diversity XRO\n      subobjects.\n   IPv4/IPv6
      Diversity Identifier Source Address:\n      This field MUST be set to the IPv4/IPv6
      address of the node that\n      assigns the diversity identifier.  Depending
      on the Diversity\n      Identifier Type, the diversity identifier source may
      be a client\n      node, PCE entity, or network node.  Specifically:\n      *
      \ When the Diversity Identifier Type is set to the \"Client-\n         Initiated
      Identifier\", the value MUST be set to IPv4/IPv6\n         tunnel sender address
      of the reference LSP against which\n         diversity is desired.  The IPv4/IPv6
      tunnel sender address is\n         as defined in [RFC3209].\n      *  When the
      Diversity Identifier Type is set to \"PCE-Allocated\n         Identifier\",
      the value MUST be set to the IPv4/IPv6 address of\n         the node that assigned
      the Path Key identifier and that can\n         return an expansion of the Path
      Key or use the Path Key as\n         exclusion in a path computation.  The Path
      Key is defined in\n         [RFC5553].  The PCE ID is carried in the Diversity
      Identifier\n         Source Address field of the subobject.\n      *  When the
      Diversity Identifier Type is set to \"Network-Assigned\n         Identifier\",

      \  but does not support the DI Type, it MUST return a PathErr with the\n   error
      code \"Routing Problem\" (24) and error sub-code \"Unsupported\n   Diversity
      Identifier Type\" (36).\n   In the case of DI Type \"Client-Initiated Identifier\",
      all nodes along\n   the path SHOULD process the diversity information signaled
      in the\n   XRO/EXRS Diversity subobjects to verify that the signaled diversity\n
      \  constraint is satisfied.  If a diversity violation is detected,\n   crankback
      signaling MAY be initiated.\n   In the case of DI Type \"PCE-Allocated Identifier\"
      and \"Network-\n   Assigned Identifier\", the nodes in the domain that perform
      path\n   computation SHOULD process the diversity information signaled in the\n
      \  XRO/EXRS Diversity subobjects as follows.  In the PCE case, the\n   ingress
      node of a domain sends a path computation request for a path\n   from ingress
      node to egress node, including diversity constraints to\n   a PCE.  Or, in the
      PAS case, the ingress node is capable of\n   calculating the path for the new
      LSP from ingress node to the egress\n   node, taking the diversity constraints
      into account.  The calculated\n   path is then carried in the Explicit Route
      Object (ERO).  Hence, the\n   transit nodes in a domain and the domain egress
      node SHOULD NOT\n   process the signaled diversity information unless path computation
      is\n   performed.\n   While processing the EXRS object, if a loose hop expansion
      results in\n   the creation of another loose hop in the outgoing ERO, the processing\n
      \  node MAY include the EXRS in the newly created loose hop for further\n   processing
      by downstream nodes.\n   The A-Flags affect the processing of the Diversity
      XRO/EXRS subobject\n   as follows:\n   o  When the \"Processing node exception\"
      flag is set, the exclusion\n      MUST be ignored for the node processing the
      XRO or EXRS subobject.\n   o  When the \"Destination node exception\" flag is
      set, the exclusion\n      MUST be ignored for the destination node in processing
      the XRO\n      subobject.  The destination node exception for the EXRS subobject\n
      \     applies to the explicit node identified by the ERO subobject that\n      identifies
      the next abstract node.  When the \"Destination node\n      exception\" flag
      is set in the EXRS subobject, exclusion MUST be\n      ignored for said node
      (i.e., the next abstract node).\n   o  When the \"Penultimate node exception\"
      flag is set in the XRO\n      subobject, the exclusion MUST be ignored for the
      penultimate node\n      on the path of the LSP being established.\n      The
      penultimate node exception for the EXRS subobject applies to\n      the node
      before the explicit node identified by the ERO subobject\n      that identifies
      the next abstract node.  When the \"Penultimate\n      node exception\" flag
      is set in the EXRS subobject, the exclusion\n      MUST be ignored for said
      node (i.e., the node before the next\n      abstract node).\n   If the L-flag
      of the Diversity XRO subobject or Diversity EXRS\n   subobject is not set, the
      processing node proceeds as follows.\n   o  If the Diversity Identifier Type
      is set to \"Client-Initiated\n      Identifier\", the processing node MUST ensure
      that the path\n      calculated/expanded for the signaled LSP is diverse from
      the route\n      taken by the LSP identified in the Diversity Identifier Value\n
      \     field.\n   o  If the Diversity Identifier Type is set to \"PCE-Allocated\n
      \     Identifier\", the processing node MUST ensure that any path\n      calculated
      for the signaled LSP is diverse from the route\n      identified by the Path
      Key.  The processing node MAY use the PCE\n      identified by the Diversity
      Identifier Source Address in the\n      subobject for route computation.  The
      processing node MAY use the\n      Path Key resolution mechanisms described
      in [RFC5553].\n   o  If the Diversity Identifier Type is set to \"Network-Assigned\n
      \     Identifier\", the processing node MUST ensure that the path\n      calculated
      for the signaled LSP is diverse with respect to the\n      values associated
      with the PAS Identifier and Diversity Identifier\n      Source Address fields.\n
      \  o  Regardless of whether the path computation is performed locally or\n      at
      a remote node (e.g., PCE), the processing node MUST ensure that\n      any path
      calculated for the signaled LSP is diverse from the\n      requested Exclusion
      Flags.\n   o  If the excluded path referenced in the XRO subobject is unknown
      to\n      the processing node, the processing node SHOULD ignore the\n      Diversity
      XRO subobject and SHOULD proceed with the signaling\n      request.  After sending
      the Resv for the signaled LSP, the\n      processing node MUST return a PathErr
      with the error code \"Notify\n      Error\" (25) and error sub-code \"Route
      of XRO LSP identifier\n      unknown\" (14) for the signaled LSP.\n   o  If
      the processing node fails to find a path that meets the\n      requested constraint,
      the processing node MUST return a PathErr\n      with the error code \"Routing
      Problem\" (24) and error sub-code\n      \"Route blocked by Exclude Route\"
      (67).\n   If the L-flag of the Diversity XRO subobject or Diversity EXRS\n   subobject
      is set, the processing node proceeds as follows:\n   o  If the Diversity Identifier
      Type is set to \"Client-Initiated\n      Identifier\", the processing node SHOULD
      ensure that the path\n      calculated/expended for the signaled LSP is diverse
      from the route\n      taken by the LSP identified in the Diversity Identifier
      Value\n      field.\n   o  If the Diversity Identifier Type is set to \"PCE-Allocated\n
      \     Identifier\", the processing node SHOULD ensure that the path\n      calculated
      for the signaled LSP is diverse from the route\n      identified by the Path
      Key.\n   o  If the Diversity Identifier Type is set to \"Network-Assigned\n
      \     Identifier\", the processing node SHOULD ensure that the path\n      calculated
      for the signaled LSP is diverse with respect to the\n      values associated
      with the PAS Identifier and Diversity Identifier\n      Source Address fields.\n
      \  o  If the processing node fails to find a path that meets the\n      requested
      constraint, it SHOULD proceed with signaling using a\n      suitable path that
      meets the constraint as far as possible.  After\n      sending the Resv for
      the signaled LSP, it MUST return a PathErr\n      message with error code \"Notify
      Error\" (25) and error sub-code\n      \"Failed to satisfy Exclude Route\" (15)
      to the source node.\n   If, subsequent to the initial signaling of a diverse
      LSP, an excluded\n   path referenced in the XRO subobject becomes known to the
      processing\n   node or a change in the excluded path becomes known to the processing\n
      \  node, the processing node MUST re-evaluate the exclusion and\n   diversity
      constraints requested by the diverse LSP to determine\n   whether they are still
      satisfied.\n   o  In the case where the L-flag was not set in the initial setup\n
      \     message, the exclusion and diversity constraints were satisfied at\n      the
      time of the initial setup.  If the processing node re-\n      evaluating the
      exclusion and diversity constraints for a diverse\n      LSP detects that the
      exclusion and diversity constraints are no\n      longer met, it MUST send a
      PathErr message for the diverse LSP\n      with the error code \"Routing Problem\"
      (24) and error sub-code\n      \"Route blocked by Exclude Route\" (67).  The
      Path_State_Removed\n      (PSR) flag [RFC3473] MUST NOT be set.  A source node
      receiving a\n      PathErr message with this error code and sub-code combination\n
      \     SHOULD take appropriate actions and move the diverse LSP to a new\n      path
      that meets the original constraints.\n   o  In the case where the L-flag was
      set in the initial setup message,\n      the exclusion and diversity constraints
      may or may not be\n      satisfied at any given time.  If the exclusion constraints
      for a\n      diverse LSP were satisfied before, and if the processing node re-\n
      \     evaluating the exclusion and diversity constraints for a diverse\n      LSP
      detects that exclusion and diversity constraints are no longer\n      met, it
      MUST send a PathErr message for the diverse LSP with the\n      error code \"Notify
      Error\" (25) and error sub-code \"Failed to\n      satisfy Exclude Route\" (15).
      \ The PSR flag MUST NOT be set.  The\n      source node MAY take no consequent
      action and keep the LSP along\n      the path that does not meet the original
      constraints.  Similarly,\n      if the exclusion constraints for a diverse LSP
      were not satisfied\n      before, and if the processing node re-evaluating the
      exclusion and\n      diversity constraints for a diverse LSP detects that the
      exclusion\n      constraints are met, it MUST send a PathErr message for the\n
      \     diverse LSP with the error code \"Notify Error\" (25) and a new\n      error
      sub-code \"Compliant path exists\" (16).  The PSR flag MUST\n      NOT be set.
      \ A source node receiving a PathErr message with this\n      error code and
      sub-code combination MAY move the diverse LSP to a\n      new path that meets
      the original constraints.\n"

  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not introduce any additional
    security issues in\n   addition to those identified in [RFC5920], [RFC2205], [RFC3209],\n
    \  [RFC3473], [RFC2747], [RFC4874], [RFC5520], and [RFC5553].\n   The diversity
    mechanisms defined in this document rely on the new\n   diversity subobject that
    is carried in the XRO or EXRS, respectively.\n   In Section 7 of [RFC4874], it
    is noted that some administrative\n   boundaries may remove the XRO due to security
    concerns on explicit\n   route information exchange.  However, when the diversity
    subobjects\n   specified in this document are used, removing at the administrative\n
    \  boundary an XRO containing these diversity subobjects would result in\n   the
    request for diversity being dropped at the boundary, and path\n   computation
    would be unlikely to produce the requested diverse path.\n   As such, diversity
    subobjects MUST be retained in an XRO crossing an\n   administrative boundary,
    even if other subobjects are removed.  This\n   retention would be based on operator
    policy.  The use of diversity\n   subobjects is based on mutual agreement.  This
    avoids the need to\n   share the identity of network resources when supporting
    diversity.\n"
