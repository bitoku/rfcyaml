    \  Such an indication is useful to allow the\n   call to be retried without anonymity.\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] allows for\
    \ users to\n   make anonymous calls.  In RFC 3261, this is done by including a\
    \ From\n   header field whose display name has the value of \"Anonymous\".\n \
    \  Greater levels of anonymity were subsequently defined in [RFC3323],\n   which\
    \ introduces the Privacy header field.  The Privacy header field\n   allows a\
    \ requesting User Agent (UA) to ask for various levels of\n   anonymity, including\
    \ user level anonymity, header level anonymity,\n   and session level anonymity.\
    \  [RFC3325] additionally defined the\n   P-Asserted-Identity header field, used\
    \ to contain an asserted\n   identity.  RFC 3325 also defined the 'id' value for\
    \ the Privacy\n   header field, which is used to request the network to remove\
    \ the\n   P-Asserted-Identity header field.\n   Though users need to be able to\
    \ make anonymous calls, users that\n   receive such calls retain the right to\
    \ reject the call because it is\n   anonymous.  SIP does not provide a response\
    \ code that allows the User\n   Agent Server (UAS), or a proxy acting on its behalf,\
    \ to explicitly\n   indicate that the request was rejected because it was anonymous.\
    \  The\n   closest response code is 403 (Forbidden), which doesn't convey a\n\
    \   specific reason.  While it is possible to include a reason phrase in\n   a\
    \ 403 response that indicates to the human user that the call was\n   rejected\
    \ because it was anonymous, that reason phrase is not useful\n   for automata\
    \ and cannot be interpreted by callers that speak a\n   different language.  An\
    \ indication that can be understood by an\n   automaton would allow for programmatic\
    \ handling, including user\n   interface prompts, or conversion to equivalent\
    \ error codes in the\n   Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) when the client\
    \ is a\n   gateway.\n   To remedy this, this specification defines the 433 (Anonymity\n\
    \   Disallowed) response code.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Server Behavior
  contents:
  - "3.  Server Behavior\n   A server (generally acting on behalf of the called party,\
    \ though this\n   need not be the case) MAY generate a 433 (Anonymity Disallowed)\n\
    \   response when it receives an anonymous request, and the server\n   refuses\
    \ to fulfill the request because the requestor is anonymous.  A\n   request SHOULD\
    \ be considered anonymous when the identity of the\n   originator of the request\
    \ has been explicitly withheld by the\n   originator.  This occurs in any one\
    \ of the following cases:\n   o  The From header field contains a URI within the\
    \ anonymous.invalid\n      domain.\n   o  The From header field contains a display\
    \ name whose value is\n      either 'Anonymous' or 'anonymous'.  Note that display\
    \ names make a\n      poor choice for indicating anonymity, since they are meant\
    \ to be\n      consumed by humans, not automata.  Thus, language variations and\n\
    \      even misspelling can cause an automaton to miss a hint in the\n      display\
    \ name.  Despite these problems, a check on the display name\n      is included\
    \ here because RFC 3261 explicitly calls out the usage\n      of the display name\
    \ as a way to declare anonymity.\n   o  The request contained a Privacy header\
    \ field whose value indicates\n      that the user wishes its identity withheld.\
    \  Values meeting this\n      criteria are 'id' [RFC3325] or 'user'.\n   o  The\
    \ From header field contains a URI that has an explicit\n      indication that\
    \ it is anonymous.  One such example of a mechanism\n      that would meet this\
    \ criteria is [coexistence].  This criteria is\n      true even if the request\
    \ has a validated Identity header field\n      [RFC4474], which can be used in\
    \ concert with anonymized From\n      header fields.\n   Lack of a network-asserted\
    \ identity (such as the P-Asserted-Identity\n   header field), in and of itself,\
    \ SHOULD NOT be considered an\n   indication of anonymity.  Even though a Privacy\
    \ header field value of\n   'id' will cause the removal of a network-asserted\
    \ identity, there is\n   no way to differentiate this case from one in which a\
    \ network-\n   asserted identity was not supported by the originating domain.\
    \  As a\n   consequence, a request without a network-asserted identity is\n  \
    \ considered anonymous only when there is some other indication of\n   this, such\
    \ as a From header field with a display name of 'Anonymous'.\n   In addition,\
    \ requests where the identity of the requestor cannot be\n   determined or validated,\
    \ but it is not a consequence of an explicit\n   action on the part of the requestor,\
    \ are not considered anonymous.\n   For example, if a request contains a non-anonymous\
    \ From header field,\n   along with the Identity and Identity-Info header fields\
    \ [RFC4474],\n   but the certificate could not be obtained from the reference\
    \ in the\n   Identity-Info header field, it is not considered an anonymous\n \
    \  request, and the 433 response code SHOULD NOT be used.\n"
- title: 4.  UAC Behavior
  contents:
  - "4.  UAC Behavior\n   A User Agent Client (UAC) receiving a 433 (Anonymity Disallowed)\
    \ MUST\n   NOT retry the request without anonymity unless it obtains\n   confirmation\
    \ from the user that this is desirable.  Such confirmation\n   could be obtained\
    \ through the user interface, or by accessing user-\n   defined policy.  If the\
    \ user has indicated that this is desirable,\n   the UAC MAY retry the request\
    \ without requesting anonymity.  Note\n   that if the UAC were to automatically\
    \ retry the request without\n   anonymity in the absence of an indication from\
    \ the user that this\n   treatment is desirable, then the user's expectations\
    \ would not be\n   met.  Consequently, a user might think it had completed a call\n\
    \   anonymously when it is not actually anonymous.\n   Receipt of a 433 response\
    \ to a mid-dialog request SHOULD NOT cause\n   the dialog to terminate, and SHOULD\
    \ NOT cause the specific usage of\n   that dialog to terminate [RFC5057].\n  \
    \ A UAC that does not understand or care about the specific semantics\n   of the\
    \ 433 response will treat it as a 400 response.\n"
- title: 5.  433 (Anonymity Disallowed) Definition
  contents:
  - "5.  433 (Anonymity Disallowed) Definition\n   This response indicates that the\
    \ server refused to fulfill the\n   request because the requestor was anonymous.\
    \  Its default reason\n   phrase is \"Anonymity Disallowed\".\n"

    \ Number:  433\n   Default Reason Phrase:  Anonymity Disallowed\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The fact that a request was rejected because\
    \ it was anonymous does\n   reveal information about the called party -- that\
    \ the called party\n   does not accept anonymous calls.  This information may\
    \ or may not be\n   sensitive.  If it is, a UAS SHOULD reject the request with\
    \ a 403\n   instead.\n   In the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), the\
    \ Anonymous Call\n   Rejection (ACR) feature is commonly used to prevent unwanted\
    \ calls\n   from telemarketers (also known as spammers).  Since telemarketers\n\
    \   frequently withhold their identity, anonymous call rejection has the\n   desired\
    \ effect in many (but not all) cases.  It is important to note\n   that the response\
    \ code described here is likely to be ineffective in\n   blocking SIP-based spam.\
    \  The reason is that a malicious caller can\n   include a From header field and\
    \ display name that is not anonymous,\n   but is meaningless and invalid.  Without\
    \ a Privacy header field, such\n   a request will not appear anonymous and thus\
    \ not be blocked by an\n   anonymity screening service.  Dealing with SIP-based\
    \ spam is not a\n   simple problem.  The reader is referred to [sipping-spam]\
    \ for a\n   discussion of the problem.\n   When anonymity services are being provided\
    \ as a consequence of an\n   anonymizer function acting as a back-to-back user\
    \ agent (B2BUA)\n   [RFC3323], and the anonymizer receives a 433 response, the\
    \ anonymizer\n   MUST NOT retry the request without anonymization unless it has\
    \ been\n   explicitly configured by the user to do so.  In essence, the same\n\
    \   rules that apply to a UA in processing of a 433 response apply to a\n   network-based\
    \ anonymization function, and for the same reasons.\n"
