  - "Executive Summary\n   This white paper describes engineering considerations for\
    \ IPng as\n   solicited by RFC 1550 [1].  IPng should provide support for existing\n\
    \   and emerging link technologies that it will be transported over. Link\n  \
    \ technologies like Ethernet simply multiplex traffic from upper layer\n   protocols\
    \ onto a single channel. \"Sophisticated\" link technologies\n   like ATM are\
    \ emerging in the marketplace allowing several virtual\n   channels to be established\
    \ over a single wire (or fiber) potentially\n   based on an applications' network\
    \ performance objectives.\n   Support for both \"sophisticated\" (ATM) and existing\
    \ link technologies\n   needs to be considered in an IPng candidate. End-to-end\
    \ applications\n   will communicate through a network where IPng packets travel\
    \ across\n   subnetworks such as Ethernet and Hippi and also more \"sophisticated\"\
    \n   link levels such as ATM.  Though initial support for IPng over ATM\n   subnetworks\
    \ will not facilitate a virtual circuit per application,\n   the hooks to provide\
    \ such a mapping should be in place while also\n   maintaining support for the\
    \ transport of IPng packets across\n   conventional subnetworks. Application support\
    \ for QOS-based link\n   level service requires that the  following types of ATM\
    \ information\n   be mappable (or derivable) from the higher level protocol(s)\
    \ such as\n   IPng: source and destination(s) addresses, connection quality of\n\
    \   service parameters, connection state, and ATM virtual circuit\n   identifier.\
    \ Some of these mappings may be derivable from information\n   provided by proposed\
    \ resource reservation protocols supporting an\n   integrated services Internet\
    \ [4]. However, the ATM virtual circuit\n   identifier should be efficiently derivable\
    \ from IPng packet\n   information.\n   An IPng candidate should provide evidence\
    \ that the mapping from an\n   applications' IPng packets to ATM virtual circuit(s)\
    \ can be\n   accomplished in a heterogeneous Internet architecture keeping in\n\
    \   consideration the gigabit/sec rates that IPng/ATM subnetworks will\n   eventually\
    \ be operating at.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This paper describes parameters that are needed to map IPng\
    \ (or any\n   protocol operating above the link level) to ATM services. ATM is\
    \ a\n   \"sophisticated\" link level technology which provides the potential\n\
    \   capability for applications at the TCP/UDP level to map to a single\n   ATM\
    \ virtual circuit for transport across an ATM network(s) customized\n   to the\
    \ network performance and traffic requirements for that\n   application. This\
    \ is a step above many of today's existing link\n   technologies which can only\
    \ support a single level of network\n   performance that must be shared by all\
    \ applications operating on a\n   single endpoint.\n   The future Internet will\
    \ be comprised of both conventional and\n   \"sophisticated\" link technologies.\
    \  The \"sophisticated\" features of\n   link layers like ATM need to be incorporated\
    \ into an internet where\n   data travels not only across an ATM network but also\
    \ several other\n   existing LAN and WAN technologies. Future networks are likely\
    \ to be a\n   combination of subnetworks providing best-effort link level service\n\
    \   such as Ethernet and also sophisticated subnetworks that can support\n   quality\
    \ of service-based connections like ATM.  One can envision data\n   originating\
    \ from an Ethernet, passing through an ATM network, FDDI\n   network, another\
    \ ATM network, and finally arriving at its destination\n   residing on a HIPPI\
    \ network. IPng packets will travel through such a\n   list of interconnected\
    \ network technologies as ATM is incorporated as\n   one of the components of\
    \ the future Internet.\n   To support per application customizable link level\
    \ connections, four\n   types of ATM information should be derivable from the\
    \ higher level\n   protocol(s) like IPng. This ATM information includes: source\
    \ and\n   destination ATM addresses, connection quality of service parameters,\n\
    \   connection state, and an ATM virtual circuit identifier which maps to\n  \
    \ a single IPng application (i.e., single TCP/UDP application). Some of\n   these\
    \ mapping  could potentially be derivable through information\n   provided by\
    \ proposed resource reservation protocols supporting an\n   integrated services\
    \ Internet [4].  However, the ATM virtual circuit\n   identifier needs to be efficiently\
    \ mappable from IPng packet\n   information.\n   Organization of this white paper\
    \ is as follows. First the\n   characteristics of ATM are described focusing on\
    \ functions that are\n   not provided in today's LAN technologies. This section\
    \ provides\n   background information necessary for the following section describing\n\
    \   the parameters needed to map IPng services to ATM services.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   In this white paper, the term \"application\" refers to a\
    \ process or\n   set of collective processes operating at the TCP/UDP level or\
    \ above\n   in the protocol stack. For example, each instance of \"telnet\" or\n\
    \   \"ftp\" session running on an end station is a distinct application.\n"
- title: 3.  Characteristics of ATM Service
  contents:
  - "3.  Characteristics of ATM Service\n   ATM has several characteristics which\
    \ differentiates it from current\n   link level technologies.  First of all, ATM\
    \ has the capability of\n   providing many virtual channels to transmit information\
    \ over a single\n   wire (or fiber). This is very similar to X.25, where many\
    \ logical\n   channels can be established over a single physical media. But unlike\n\
    \   X.25, ATM allows for each of these channels or circuits to have a\n   customizable\
    \ set of performance and quality of service\n   characteristics. Link level technologies\
    \ like Ethernet provide a\n   single channel with a single performance and quality\
    \ of service\n   characteristic. In a sense,  a single ATM link level media appears\n\
    \   like an array of of link level technologies each with customizable\n   characteristics.\n\
    \   ATM virtual circuits can be established dynamically utilizing its\n   signaling\
    \ protocol. ATM signaling is a source initiated negotiation\n   process for connection\
    \ establishment. This protocol informs elements\n   in the network of the characteristics\
    \ for the desired connection. ATM\n   signaling does not provide any guidelines\
    \ for how network elements\n   decide whether it can accept a call or where a\
    \ signaling request\n   should be forwarded if the end destination (from the link\
    \ level\n   perspective) has not been reached. In short, ATM signaling does not\n\
    \   support any routing functionality of network admission control.\n   ATM signaling\
    \ establishes a \"hard state\" in the network for a call.\n   \"Hard state\" implies\
    \ that the state of a connection in intermediate\n   switching equipment can be\
    \ set and once established it will be\n   maintained until a message is received\
    \ by one of the ends of the call\n   requesting a change in state for the connection\
    \ [2]. As a result, an\n   ATM end system (this could be a workstation with an\
    \ ATM adapter or a\n   router with an ATM interface) receives guaranteed service\
    \ from the\n   ATM network. The ATM network is responsible for maintaining the\n\
    \   connection state. The price the ATM termination points pay for this\n   guarantee\
    \ is the responsibility of changing the state of the\n   connection, specifically\
    \ informing the ATM network to establish,\n   alter, or tear-down the connection.\n\
    \   Each ATM end point in a network has an ATM address associated with it\n  \
    \ to support dynamic connection establishment via signaling. These\n   addresses\
    \ are hierarchical in structure and globally unique [3]. As a\n   result, these\
    \ addresses are routable. This allows ATM networks to\n   eventually support a\
    \ large number of ATM endpoints once a routing\n   architecture and protocols\
    \ to support it become available.\n   The ATM User-Network Interface (UNI) signaling\
    \ protocol based on\n   ITU-TS Q.93B  allows many different service parameters\
    \ to be\n   specified for describing connection characteristics. [3] These\n \
    \  parameters can be grouped into several categories: ATM adaptation\n   layer\
    \ (AAL) information, network QOS objectives, connection traffic\n   descriptor,\
    \ and transit network selector. The AAL information\n   specifies negotiable parameters\
    \ such as AAL type and maximum packet\n   sizes. The network QOS objectives describe\
    \ the service that the ATM\n   user expects from the network. Q.93B allows for\
    \ one of five service\n   classes to be selected by the ATM user. The service\
    \ classes are\n   defined as general traffic types such as circuit emulation (class\
    \ A),\n   variable bit rate audio and video (class B), connection-oriented data\n\
    \   transfer (class C), connectionless data transfer (class D), best\n   effort\
    \ service (class X), and unspecified [3]. Each of these\n   categories are further\
    \ specified through network provider objectives\n   for various ATM performance\
    \ parameters. These parameters may include\n   cell transfer delay, cell delay\
    \ variation, and cell loss ratio. The\n   connection traffic descriptor specifies\
    \ characteristics of the data\n   generated by the user of the connection. This\
    \ information allows the\n   ATM network to commit the resources necessary to\
    \ support the traffic\n   flow with the quality of service the user expects. Characteristics\n\
    \   defined in the ATM Forum UNI specification include peak cell rate,\n   sustainable\
    \ cell rate, and maximum and minimum burst sizes [3].\n   Lastly, the transit\
    \ network selection parameter allows an ATM user to\n   select a preferred network\
    \ provider to service the connection [3].\n"
- title: 4.  Parameters Required to Map IPng to ATM
  contents:
  - "4.  Parameters Required to Map IPng to ATM\n   There are several parameters required\
    \ to map ATM services from a\n   higher level service like IPng. These ATM parameters\
    \ can be\n   categorized in the following manner: addressing parameters,\n   connection\
    \ QOS-related parameters, connection management information,\n   and ATM virtual\
    \ circuit identifier. The first three categories\n   provide support for ATM signaling.\
    \ The last parameter, a connection\n   identifier that maps IPng packets to ATM\
    \ virtual circuits, provides\n   support for an ATM virtual circuit per application\
    \ when the end-to-\n   end connection travels across an ATM subnetwork(s) (this\
    \ does not\n   assume that ATM is the only type of subnetwork that this connection\n\
    \   travels across). Below, mapping issues for each of these parameters\n   will\
    \ be described.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Addressing
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Addressing\n   ATM supports routable addresses to each ATM endpoint to\
    \ facilitate\n   the dynamic establishment of connections. These addresses need\
    \ to be\n   derived from a higher level address such as an IPng address and IPng\n\
    \   routing information.  This type of mapping is not novel. It is a\n   mapping\
    \ that is currently done for support of current IP over link\n   technologies\
    \ such as Ethernet.  An IP over ATM address resolution\n   protocol (ARP) has\
    \ been described in the Internet Standard,\n   \"Classical IP over ATM\" [5].\
    \ In addition, support for IP routing over\n   large ATM networks is being worked\
    \ in the IETF's \"Routing over Large\n   Clouds\" working group.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Quality of Service
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Quality of Service\n   As described in section 3, an ATM virtual circuit\
    \ is established\n   based upon a user's traffic characteristics and network performance\n\
    \   objectives. These characteristics which include delay and throughput\n   requirements\
    \ can only be defined by the application level (at the\n   transport level or\
    \ above) as opposed to the internetworking (IPng)\n   level. For instance, a file\
    \ transfer application transferring a 100\n   MB file has very different link\
    \ level performance requirements than a\n   network time application. The former\
    \ requires a high throughput and\n   low error rate connection whereas the latter\
    \ could perhaps be\n   adequately serviced utilizing a best-effort service. Current\
    \ IP does\n   not provide much support for a quality of service specification\
    \ and\n   provides no support for the specification of link level performance\n\
    \   needs by an application directly. This is due to the fact that only a\n  \
    \ single type of link level performance is available with link\n   technologies\
    \ like Ethernet.  As a result, all applications over IP\n   today receive the\
    \ same level of link service.\n   IPng packets need not explicitly contain information\
    \ parameters\n   describing an application's traffic characteristics and network\n\
    \   performance objectives (e.g., delay = low, throughput = 10 Mb/s).\n   This\
    \ information could potentially be mapped from resource\n   reservation protocols\
    \ that operate at the IP (and potentially IPng)\n   level [4].\n"
- title: 4.3.  Connection Management
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Connection Management\n   The establishment and release of ATM connections\
    \ should ultimately be\n   controlled by the applications utilizing the circuits.\
    \ As described\n   in section 3, ATM signaling establishes a \"hard state\" in\
    \ the network\n   which is controlled by the ATM termination points [2]. Currently,\
    \ IP\n   provides no explicit mechanism for link level connection management.\n\
    \   Future support for link level connection management could be\n   accomplished\
    \ through resource reservation protocols and need not\n   necessarily be supported\
    \ directly via information contained in the\n   IPng protocol.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Connection Identifier
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Connection Identifier\n   A mapping function needs to exist between IPng\
    \ packets and ATM so\n   that application flows map one-to-one to ATM virtual\
    \ circuits.\n   Currently, application traffic flows are identified at the transport\n\
    \   level by UDP/TCP source and destination ports and IP protocol\n   identifiers.\
    \  This level of identification should also be available\n   at the IPng level\
    \ so that information in the IPng packets identify an\n   application's flow and\
    \ map to an ATM virtual circuit supporting that\n   flow when the IPng packets\
    \ travels across an ATM subnetwork(s).\n   Using the current IP protocol, identifying\
    \ an application's traffic\n   flow requires the combination of the following\
    \ five parameters:\n   source and destination IP addresses, source and destination\
    \ UDP/TCP\n   ports, and IP protocol identifier. This application connection\n\
    \   identifier for IP is complex and could potentially be costly to\n   implement\
    \ in IP end stations and routers.  The IPng connection\n   identifier should be\
    \ large enough so that all application level\n   traffic from an IPng end point\
    \ can be mapped into the IPng packet.\n   Currently, ATM provides 24 bits for\
    \ virtual circuit identification\n   (VPI and VCI). This provides sufficient capacity\
    \ for 2^24\n   (16,777,216) connections [6]. The actual number of bits that are\
    \ used\n   for the ATM virtual circuit however is established through\n   negotiation\
    \ between the ATM endpoint and ATM network. This number is\n   useful as an upper\
    \ bound for the number of mappings that are needed\n   to be supported by IPng.\n\
    \   An IPng candidate should be able to identify how IPng packets from an\n  \
    \ application can map to an ATM  virtual circuit. In addition, this\n   mapping\
    \ should be large enough to support a mapping for every IPng\n   application on\
    \ an end system to an ATM virtual circuit. Careful\n   consideration should be\
    \ given to complexity of this mapping for IPng\n   to ATM since it needs to eventually\
    \ support gigabit/sec rates.\n"
