  - "ADDITIONAL NOTES\n   As soon as the user's Telnet connection is established to\
    \ the NIC,\n   the system herald will be printed, followed immediately by a brief\n\
    \   (possibly null) message to network users.  This message will contain\n   any\
    \ items that are of particular interest to network users.\n      use your site\
    \ ident as the user name\n      the password is ARPA\n      use an account number\
    \ consisting of site ident-your last name\n         for example, if we receive\
    \ the string\n                log ucla-nmc arpa ucla-postel\n         the user\
    \ will be logged in as John Postel from UCLA\n   After logging in, the (possibly\
    \ null) system message common to all\n   logins will be printed.\n   If you experience\
    \ any trouble getting into the NIC, call us via the\n   telephone numbers listed\
    \ below.  If the number is not listed as a\n   direct dial, you must contact your\
    \ operator and ask for the appro-\n   priate Zenith or Enterprise number.  If\
    \ the operator is unfamiliar\n   with the use of Enterprise or Zenith numbers,\
    \ ask to speak to the\n   supervisor.\n      Dick Watson for administrative problems.\n\
    \      John Melvin vor NCP or Telnet problems.\n      Marily Auerbach or Dirk\
    \ van Nouhuys for TNLS problems.\n      If NIC personnel do not answer, a local\
    \ answering service will\n      take the call.  Give the name of the person to\
    \ whom your question\n      is directed and your question or comment.  We will\
    \ contact the\n      answering service every morning and reply as soon as possible.\n\
