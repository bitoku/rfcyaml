Abstract This document assigns a Generic Associated Channel (G ACh) Type for carrying ITU T MPLS Transport Profile Operations, Administration, and Management
messages in the MPLS Generic Associated Channel.
The IESG notes that the IETF has developed a set of OAM tools for MPLS TP that have been published as Standards Track RFCs.
A list of the relevant RFCs can be found in RFC 6669.
The approval of this document and the assignment of an ACh Type does not constitute endorsement by the IETF of the alternate MPLS TP OAM documented in G.8113.1.
The IESG recommends instead that the RFCs noted above should be implemented.
The Transport Profile of MPLS (MPLS TP) defined in [RFC5654] is a profile of MPLS technology for use in packet transport networks.
The MPLS TP profile includes a set of Operations, Administration, and Management (OAM) tools defined by the IETF [RFC6669] that are used to meet the OAM functional requirements defined in [RFC5860].
ITU T Recommendation [G.8113.1] documents MPLS TP OAM.
This Recommendation builds upon Ethernet OAM as documented in [Y.1731].
The messages in [G.8113.1] are defined to be carried in a new Generic Associated Channel (G ACh)
Type in the MPLS Generic Associated Channel.
In order to carry these messages in an interoperable fashion, a Generic Associated Channel Type from the IANA maintained
registry "Pseudowire Associated Channel Types" is to be used.
To fulfill the request from ITU T SG15 in [LS370] and to allow deployment of the [G.8113.1] OAM solution without using an experimental G ACh Type, IANA has assigned a G ACh Type <0x8902
> for use by the ITU T for [G.8113.1].
This G ACh Type is known as the "G.8113.1 OAM G ACh Type".
A number of experts in the IETF do not consider that the development or deployment of a second protocol solution within the same architectural problem space is necessary or advisable
Conventions Used in This Document 2.1.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
Scope of the G.8113.1 OAM G ACh Type
The G ACh Type assigned by this document MUST only be used for OAM messages, as defined in the ITU T Recommendation [G.8113.1], carried in the G ACh.
The OAM messages and procedures carried behind this G ACh Type are restricted to only those that address the OAM functional requirements defined in [RFC5860].
Other message types MUST NOT be carried behind this G ACh Type.
All ITU T Recommendations are subject to updates by errata, corrigenda, amendments, or complete revisions.
In any update of [G.8113.1], the G ACh Type assigned by this document MUST NOT be used for any functions not identified as OAM functional requirements in [RFC5860].
An update of [G.8113.1] may use the G ACh Type assigned by this document to support the OAM functions identified in [RFC5860].
When an amendment or complete revision of G.8113.1 is approved, the reference to [G.8113.1], provided in this document, should be updated to show the approval date of the new version.
The G ACh Type assigned by this document may be used on any transport construct that uses the G ACh, e.g., MPLS TP Sections, MPLS TP LSPs, or PWs as described in [G.8113.1].
As noted in [RFC5586], when new G ACh Types are defined, the "security considerations MUST be described in the relevant associated channel type specification".
The IETF takes this opportunity to remind the ITU T of the need to describe security considerations in [G.8113.1].
IANA Considerations IANA maintains the "Pseudowire Associated Channel Types"
sub registry of the "Pseudowire Name Spaces (PWE3)" registry.
IANA has allocated a new G ACh Type as follows:
