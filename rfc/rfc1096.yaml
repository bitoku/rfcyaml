- title: Status of This Memo
  contents:
  - "Status of This Memo\n   This RFC specifies a standard for the Internet community.\
    \  Hosts on\n   the Internet that transmit the X display location within the Telnet\n\
    \   protocol are expected to adopt and implement this standard.\n   Distribution\
    \ of this memo is unlimited.\n   This standard is modelled on RFC 1079 [1], the\
    \ telnet terminal speed\n   option.  Much of the text of this document is copied\
    \ from that RFC.\n"
- title: Motivation
  contents:
  - "Motivation\n   When a user is running the Telnet client under the X window system,\n\
    \   it is useful for the remote Telnet to know the X display location of\n   that\
    \ client.  For example, the user might wish to start other X\n   applications\
    \ from the remote host using the same display location as\n   the Telnet client.\
    \  The purpose of this option is to make this\n   information available through\
    \ telnet connections.\n"

  - "2. Command Meanings\n      IAC WILL X-DISPLAY-LOCATION\n         Sender is willing\
    \ to send the X display location in a\n         subsequent sub-negotiation.\n\
    \      IAC WON'T X-DISPLAY-LOCATION\n         Sender refuses to send the X display\
    \ location.\n      IAC DO X-DISPLAY-LOCATION\n         Sender is willing to receive\
    \ the X display location in a\n         subsequent sub-negotiation.\n      IAC\
    \ DON'T X-DISPLAY-LOCATION\n         Sender refuses to accept the X display location.\n\
    \      IAC SB X-DISPLAY-LOCATION SEND IAC SE\n         Sender requests receiver\
    \ to transmit his (the receiver's) X\n         display location.  The code for\
    \ SEND is 1.  (See below.)\n      IAC SB X-DISPLAY-LOCATION IS ... IAC SE\n  \
    \       Sender is stating his X display location.  The code for IS is\n      \
    \   0.  (See below.)\n"
- title: 3. Default
  contents:
  - "3. Default\n      WON'T X-DISPLAY-LOCATION\n         The X display location will\
    \ not be exchanged.\n      DON'T X-DISPLAY-LOCATION\n         The X display location\
    \ will not be exchanged.\n"
- title: 4. Description of the Option
  contents:
  - "4. Description of the Option\n   WILL and DO are used only to obtain and grant\
    \ permission for future\n   discussion.  The actual exchange of status information\
    \ occurs within\n   option subcommands (IAC SB X-DISPLAY-LOCATION...).\n   Once\
    \ the two hosts have exchanged a WILL and a DO, the sender of the\n   DO X-DISPLAY-LOCATION\
    \ is free to request the X display location.\n   Only the sender of the DO may\
    \ send requests (IAC SB X-DISPLAY-\n   LOCATION SEND IAC SE) and only the sender\
    \ of the WILL may transmit\n   actual X display location (within an IAC SB X-DISPLAY-LOCATION\
    \ IS ...\n   IAC SE command).  The X display location may not be sent\n   spontaneously,\
    \ but only in response to a request.\n   The X display location is an NVT ASCII\
    \ string.  This string follows\n   the normal Unix convention used for the DISPLAY\
    \ environment variable,\n   e.g.,\n         <host>:<dispnum>[.<screennum>]\n \
    \  No extraneous characters such as spaces may be included.\n      The following\
    \ is an example of use of the option:\n         Host1: IAC DO X-DISPLAY-LOCATION\n\
    \         Host2: IAC WILL X-DISPLAY-LOCATION\n      (Host1 is now free to request\
    \ status information at any time.)\n         Host1: IAC SB X-DISPLAY-LOCATION\
    \ SEND IAC SE\n         Host2: IAC SB X-DISPLAY-LOCATION IS \"SRI-NIC.ARPA:0.0\"\
    \ IAC SE\n      (This command is 22 octets.)\n"
- title: 5. Implementation Suggestions
  contents:
  - "5. Implementation Suggestions\n   Since the X display location may not contain\
    \ a hostname on the client\n   host, i.e., \":0\" or \"unix:0.0\", the Telnet\
    \ client will need to modify\n   the location appropriately before sending it\
    \ on to the remote Telnet.\n"
