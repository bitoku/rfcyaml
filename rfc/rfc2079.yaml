- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) are being widely used to specify\
    \ the\n   location of Internet resources.  There is an urgent need to be able\n\
    \   to include URLs in directories that conform to the LDAP and X.500\n   information\
    \ models, and a desire to include other types of Uniform\n   Resource Identifiers\
    \ (URIs) as they are defined.  A number of\n   independent groups are already\
    \ experimenting with the inclusion of\n   URLs in LDAP and X.500 directories.\
    \  This document builds on the\n   experimentation to date and defines a new attribute\
    \ type and an\n   auxiliary object class to allow URIs, including URLs, to be\
    \ stored in\n   directory entries in a standard way.\n"
- title: Background and Intended Usage
  contents:
  - "Background and Intended Usage\n   Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) as defined\
    \ by [1] are the first of\n   several types of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)\
    \ being defined by\n   the IETF.  URIs are widely used on the Internet, most notably\
    \ within\n   Hypertext Markup Language [2] documents. This document defines an\n\
    \   X.500 [3,4] attribute type called labeledURI and an auxiliary object\n   class\
    \ called labeledURIObject to hold all types of URIs, including\n   URLs.  These\
    \ definitions are designed for use in LDAP and X.500\n   directories, and may\
    \ be used in other contexts as well.\n"

- title: Discussion of the labeledURI Attribute Type
  contents:
  - "Discussion of the labeledURI Attribute Type\n   The labeledURI attribute type\
    \ has the caseExactString syntax (since\n   URIs are case-sensitive) and it is\
    \ multivalued.  Values placed in the\n   attribute should consist of a URI (at\
    \ the present time, a URL)\n   optionally followed by one or more space characters\
    \ and a label.\n   Since space characters are not allowed to appear un-encoded\
    \ in URIs,\n   there is no ambiguity about where the label begins.  At the present\n\
    \   time, the URI portion must comply with the URL specification [1].\n   Multiple\
    \ labeledURI values will generally indicate different\n   resources that are all\
    \ related to the X.500 object, but may indicate\n   different locations for the\
    \ same resource.\n   The label is used to describe the resource to which the URI\
    \ points,\n   and is intended as a friendly name fit for human consumption.  This\n\
    \   document does not propose any specific syntax for the label part.  In\n  \
    \ some cases it may be helpful to include in the label some indication\n   of\
    \ the kind and/or size of the resource referenced by the URI.\n   Note that the\
    \ label may include any characters allowed by the\n   caseExactString syntax,\
    \ but that the use of non-IA5 (non-ASCII)\n   characters is discouraged as not\
    \ all directory clients may handle\n   them in the same manner.  If non-IA5 characters\
    \ are included, they\n   should be represented using the X.500 conventions, not\
    \ the HTML\n   conventions (e.g., the character that is an \"a\" with a ring above\
    \ it\n   should be encoded using the T.61 sequence 0xCA followed by an \"a\"\n\
    \   character; do not use the HTML escape sequence \"&aring\").\n"

    \ allow for inclusion of URI\n   values.  This approach does not preclude including\

    \ viewers of the entire document in which the labeledURI value\n   was inserted.\n"

  - "Appendix:  The labeledURL Attribute Type (Deprecated)\n   An earlier draft of\
    \ this document defined an additional attribute\n   type called labeledURL.  This\
    \ attribute type is deprecated, and\n   should not be used when adding new values\
    \ to directory entries.  The\n   original motivation for including a separate\
    \ attribute type to hold\n   URLs was that this would better enable efficient\
    \ progammatic access\n   to specific types of URIs.  After some deliberation,\
    \ the IETF-ASID\n   working group concluded that it was better to simply have\
    \ one\n   attribute than two.\n   The schema definition for labeledURL is included\
    \ here for historical\n   reference only.  Directory client software may want\
    \ to support this\n   schema definition (in addition to labeledURI) to ease the\
    \ transition\n   away from labeledURL for those sites that are using it.\n   Name:\
