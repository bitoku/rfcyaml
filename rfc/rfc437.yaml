  - "                  DATA RECONFIGURATION SERVICE AT UCSB\n   This purpose of this\
    \ RFC is to announce the availability of the Data\n   Reconfiguration Service\
    \ (DRS) at UCSB, and to describe the use of the\n   DRS Time Sharing System. \
    \ The DRS is an experiment in a flexible\n   means for reformatting Network data\
    \ streams.  The DRS provides a\n   means for coupling processes with different\
    \ input/output interfaces,\n   and carrying out user specified transformations\
    \ on the data passing\n   between them.  Samples of representative uses of the\
    \ DRS include\n   field insertion, field deletion, variable length string processing,\n\
    \   string length computation, field transposition, character packing and\n  \
    \ unpacking, and character set translations.\n   To use the DRS, a user first\
    \ defines a \"form\", or a description of\n   the reformatting to be performed\
    \ on data passing between two sockets\n   (a form is associated with each unidirectional\
    \ message path).  DRS\n   may then be directed to establish Network connections\
    \ with the two\n   processes involved and to monitor the dialogue between them.\
    \  DRS\n   receives an input stream from one process, reformats the input\n  \
    \ according to the rules specified by the form, and emits the\n   reformatted\
    \ data as an output stream to the second process.  The two\n   processes communicate\
    \ as if they were directly connected to each\n   other.\n   Three major components\
    \ comprise the DRS: a compiler which reduces DRS\n   source programs (forms) to\
    \ a simpler, machine independent instruction\n   sequence (object program), an\
    \ interpreter which executes the object\n   program created by the compiler, and\
    \ an executive program, the DRS\n   Time Sharing System, which interfaces the\
    \ Network user to the DRS.\n   Detailed descriptions of the DRS source language\
    \ and compiler are\n   available in the following documents:\n      \"The Data\
    \ Reconfiguration Service--An Experiment in Adaptable,\n      Process/Process\
    \ Communications\", The Rand Corp., R-860-ARPA,\n      November 1971.\n      \"\
    Data Reconfiguration Service Compiler: Communications Among\n      Heterogeneous\
    \ Computer Centers Using Remote Resource Sharing\", The\n      Rand Corp.,R-887-ARPA,\
    \ April 1972.\n   The DRS Time Sharing System (DRS/TSS) and its server Telnet\
    \ are\n   currently available and addressable through socket 1281 decimal.\n \
    \  DRS/TSS interfaces the user to the DRS.  In addition to a subset of\n   'TENEX-like'\
    \ executive commands, commands are available for creating\n   and storing forms\
    \ by name, and for invoking the DRS compiler or\n   interpreter.  Since both the\
    \ compiler and the interpreter run\n   asynchronously to the DRS/TSS, the user\
    \ is notified when execution of\n   his requests for compilations or interpreting\
    \ are initiated and\n   terminated.  In addition, a diagnostic message is supplied\
    \ by the\n   interpreter whenever it terminates execution of a form.\n   When\
    \ a user connects to DRS/TSS he is allocated an internal TTY\n   number by which\
    \ his terminal is identified.  When the user issues a\n   command to invoke the\
    \ compiler or interpreter, his TTY number and a\n   user specified job name are\
    \ used to uniquely identify the request.\n   The jobname is thereafter used to\
    \ refer to the request.  A Network\n   host is specified by host name, or by host\
    \ number preceded by #.  A\n   socket number is specified as an integer, optionally\
    \ preceded by a\n   (decimal) to indicate the radix used.  Decimal is the default\
    \ radix\n   and positive the default sign.  A negative socket number is\n   maintained\
    \ in two's complement form.\n   The following control characters are recognized\
    \ by DRS.  Control A\n   (SOH) or rubout (DEL) delete the last character, control\
    \ V (SYN)\n   deletes the last word, control W (ETB) deletes the last phrase,\
    \ and\n   control X (CAN) deletes the entire line.  Control D (EOT) displays\n\
    \   the current word, control E (ENQ) displays the current phrase, and\n   control\
    \ F (ACK) displays the entire line.  Control Y (EM) displays\n   the name of the\
    \ current phrase.  Command accept is carriage return-\n   line feed, or period.\
    \  A space will force recognition of the current\n   word, and '?' will list the\
    \ input(s) currently possible.\n   The following sections describe the DRS/TSS\
    \ command syntax. <CA>\n   denotes command accept, and brackets [] denote optional\
    \ information.\n   All literal information is enclosed in quotes ''.  Choose one\n\
    \   alternative form items in parenthesized lists separated by |.\n"

  - "Command Descriptions:\n   'ATTACH' <tty no.> <password> <CA>\n   Connects the\
    \ user's console to the DRS/TTS terminal with\n   identification number <tty no.>.\
    \ Terminal <tty no.> must have been\n   previously detached, and must not have\
    \ been deleted. (Currently,\n   detached terminals are deleted after 1 hour.)\n\
    \   'BREAK' (<tty list>|<CA>) <CA>\n   Causes links to the terminals specified\
    \ in <tty list> to be broken.\n   If <tty list> is not specified, all established\
    \ links are broken.\n   (See 'LINK', 'MONITOR', and 'SELECT' for a description\
    \ of how links\n   are established.)\n   'COMPILE' <job name> formid> <CA>\n \
    \  Causes form <formid> to be compiled.  Verification that the source\n   for\
    \ form <formid> exists, and that object code does not already exist\n   is made\
    \ before invoking the DRS Compiler, which executes\n   asynchronously to the user's\
    \ terminal.  The DRS Compiler generates a\n   diagnostic file for the form and,\
    \ if no errors are encountered,\n   object files. <job name> is used to identify\
    \ the request and may not\n   be used to identify any other job so long as the\
    \ current request is\n   outstanding.\n   Because of main storage requirements,\
    \ only one compilation is allowed\n   in execution at any time.  Subsequent requests\
    \ are queued for later\n   execution unless the request queue is full, in which\
    \ case the request\n   is refused.  The user is notified when his compilation\
    \ is initiated,\n   and when it terminates.\n   'CONVERT' <integer> ['TO'] <base>\
    \ <CA>\n   Allows the user to convert octal, decimal, or hexadecimal integers\n\
    \   from one radix to another. <base> specifies the desired radix of the\n   result\
    \ and may be 'OCTAL', DECIMAL', or 'HEXADECIMAL'.\n   'DEFINE' <formid> <CA>\n\
    \   Allows the user to define a new source form, or append to an existing\n  \
    \ source form.  The new line indicator '$$' replaces the normal '$' to\n   indicate\
    \ that input will be used to define the source form.  Control\n   C (ETX) signals\
    \ the end of form definition and elicits the normal '$'\n   new line indicator.\n\
    \   Unfortunately, the current facilities for editing forms are extremely\n  \
    \ limited.  Only the line currently being entered may be edited.  Once\n   a line\
    \ has been terminated, with CR-LF, and the new line indicator\n   has appeared,\
    \ the line may not be edited.  The following control\n   characters may be used\
    \ to edit a form while it is being defined.\n   Control A (SOH) or Rubout (DEL)\
    \ delete the last character, control X\n   (CAN) deletes the entire line, and\
    \ control F (ACK) displays the\n   entire line.  If modifications need to be made\
    \ to lines other than\n   the current line, the entire form must be deleted and\
    \ reentered.\n   'DELETE' [<file type>] <formid> <CA>\n   Deletes the specified\
    \ component file(s) of form <formid>. <file type>\n   specifies the component\
    \ file to be deleted, either 'SOURCE',\n   'DIAGNOSTIC', or 'OBJECT_CODE'.  If\
    \ <file type> is not specified, all\n   components of the form are deleted.\n\
    \   'DETACH' <CA> <CA>\n   Breaks the TELNET connection between DRS and the user,\
    \ but does not\n   delete the user's DRS terminal for some fixed period of time,\n\
    \   currently 1 hour.  Any jobs the terminal has active are unaffected\n   when\
    \ the terminal is detached.  The user may subsequently reconnect\n   to his DRS\
    \ terminal by using the 'ATTACH' command.\n   'DIRECTORY' <formid> <CA>\n   Lists\
    \ which component(s) of form <formid> exist.  A complete form\n   consists of\
    \ 'SOURCE', 'DIAGNOSTICS', and 'OBJECT_CODE' files.\n   'DISCONNECT' <CA> <CA>\n\
    \   Breaks the TELNET connection between DRS and the user and deletes the\n  \
    \ user's DRS terminal.  Any jobs the terminal has active are purged.\n   'FULLDUPLEX'\
    \ <CA>\n   Directs DRS to echo user input; nullifies a previous\n   'LINE_AT_A_TIME'\
    \ command.\n   'HALFDUPLEX' <CA>\n   Directs DRS not to echo user input nullifies\
    \ a previous\n   'LINE_AT_A_TIME' command.\n   'HELP' <CA>\n   Lists the DRS control\
    \ characters and their meanings.\n   'LINE_AT_A_TIME' <CA>\n   Tells DRS that\
    \ the user is operating in line_at_a_time mode, and\n   nullifies a previous 'FULLDUPLEX'\
    \ or 'HALFDUPLEX' command.  DRS will\n   not send any output to the user while\
    \ he is inputting commands.\n   'LINK' ('ENABLE'|'DISABLE'|<tty list>|<CA>) <CA>\n\
    \   The link command may be used to enable or disable links to other\n   terminals,\
    \ or to establish links between terminals.\n   'LINK' 'ENABLE' <CA> directs DRS\
    \ to allow subsequent request by other\n   terminals to establish links with the\
    \ user's terminal.\n   'LINK' 'DISABLE' <CA> directs DRS to refuse subsequent\
    \ request by\n   other terminals to establish links with the user's terminal.\n\
    \   'LINK' (<tty list>|<CA>) <CA> requests DRS to establish bidirectional\n  \
    \ links between the user's terminal and the terminals specified in <tty\n   list>.\
    \  If <tty list> is omitted, DRS attempts to link the user's\n   terminal to all\
    \ other active terminals.  While the user's terminal is\n   linked to another\
    \ terminal, all output to the user's terminal will\n   also be routed to the linked\
    \ terminal, and all output to the linked\n   terminal will also be routed to the\
    \ user's terminal.  Unidirectional\n   links may be established via the 'MONITOR'\
    \ and 'SELECT' commands.\n   'LIST' [<file type>] <formid> <CA>\n   Lists the\
    \ contents of the <file type> file of form <formid>. <file\n   type> may be 'SOURCE',\
    \ 'DIAGNOSTIC' or 'OBJECT_CODE', and defaults to\n   'SOURCE'.\n   'LOGIN' <userid>\
    \ <password> <acct no.> <CA>\n   Logs the user in, enables job-oriented commands,\
    \ and specifies the\n   account to which the use of DRS is to be billed.  Currently\
    \ billing\n   for DRS is not implemented, and <userid> and <acct no.> may be\n\
    \   arbitrarily chosen by the user.  When billing for DRS is implemented,\n  \
    \ user ID's and account numbers will be assigned and checked for\n   validity\
    \ at login.  The only currently acceptable <password> is\n   'ARPA'.\n   'LOGOUT'\
    \ <CA>\n   Logs the user out and disables job-oriented commands and billing of\n\
    \   subsequent activity to the previously specified accounting\n   parameters.\
    \  As with 'DISCONNECT', any jobs the terminal has active\n   are purged.\n  \
    \ 'MONITOR' (<tty list>|<CA>)  <CA>\n   Requests DRS to establish unidirectional\
    \ links between the user's\n   terminal and the terminals specified in <tty list>.\
    \  If <tty list> is\n   omitted, DRS attempts to link the user's terminal to all\
    \ other active\n   terminals.  While the user's terminal is monitoring another\
    \ terminal,\n   all output to that terminal will also be routed to the user's\n\
    \   terminal.\n   'QUIT' (<job name>|<CA>)  <CA>\n   Requests DRS to purge the\
    \ job (request for compilation or\n   interpreting) identified by <job name>.\
    \  If <job name> is omitted,\n   all active jobs are purged.\n   'RADIX' <base>\
    \ <CA>\n   Allows the user to specify the radix to be used for subsequent\n  \
    \ integer display. <base> may be 'OCTAL', 'DECIMAL', or 'HEXADECIMAL'.\n   The\
    \ default display radix is decimal.\n   'RENAME' <formid> [\"TO'] <formid> <CA>\n\
    \   Allows the user to rename a form.  The names of all components of the\n  \
    \ form specified by the first <formid> are changed to correspond to the\n   second\
    \ <formid>.  If the form specified by the second <formid>\n   already exists,\
    \ no change of name occurs, and the user is notified.\n   'RESPONSE' ('ALL'|'HANDHOLD'|'PROMPT'|'NORMAL'|'UNUSUAL'|\
    \ 'ERRORS'|\n   'NONE') <CA>\n   Allows the user to specify the level of messages\
    \ the system should\n   provide.  The default response level is 'ALL'.\n   'RUN'\
    \ <job name> ('SIMPLEX' <run parameters>|'DUPLEX' '(' <run\n   parameters> <run\
    \ parameters> ')') <CA>\n   Causes DRS to establish the requested Network connections\
    \ and direct\n   the DRS interpreter to apply the specified form(s) to data passing\n\
    \   over the connections.  The user first specifies the job name by which\n  \
    \ his request will be identified, and second whether simplex or duplex\n   Network\
    \ connections are to be established. 'SIMPLEX' implies that a\n   single unidirectional\
    \ message path is to be employed, and requires\n   one set of <run parameters>.\
    \ 'DUPLEX' implies that two message paths\n   will be employed are requires two\
    \ sets of <run parameters>. < run\n   parameters> specify the data necessary to\
    \ establish a Network\n   connection, time limits for the DRS interpreter, and\
    \ the form which\n   is to be applied to the Network data stream.\n   <run parameters>\
    \ = ('SICP' <socket number>|'UICP' [<hostid>]\n                      <socket number>|'RFC'\
    \  [<hostid>] <socket\n                      number> [<hostid>] <socket number>)\n\
    \                      ['BYTE_SIZE' <integer>] ['CONNECT_TIME'\n             \
    \         <integer>] ['RUN_TIME' <integer>] <formid>\n   Three methods are available\
    \ for establishing Network connections:\n   'SICP', 'UICP', and 'RFC'. 'SICP (Server\
    \ Initial Connection Protocol)\n   and 'UICP' causes DRS to simulate a server\
    \ process addressable\n   through socket <socket number> at UCSB and wait for\
    \ a user process to\n   connect to it. 'UICP' directs DRS to simulate a user process\
    \ and\n   connect to the server addressable through Host <hostid>, socket\n  \
    \ <socket number>. 'RFC' directs DRS to connect directly to the two\n   sockets\
    \ specified.  In the case of 'RFC', one of the two sockets\n   specified must\
    \ be a send socket, and the other must be a receive\n   socket. <hostid> defaults\
    \ to the Host from which the user logged into\n   the DRS/TSS.\n   The remaining\
    \ fields in <run parameters> are defined as follows:\n   'BYTE_SIZE' <integer>\
    \     specifies the byte size to be used, and\n                             defaults\
    \ to 8.\n   'CONNECT_TIME' <integer>  specifies the amount of time, in seconds,\n\
    \                             that DRS should wait for the connection to\n   \
    \                          be established. The default value is 30\n         \
    \                    seconds.\n   'RUN_TIME' <integer>      specifies the maximum\
    \ amount of time, in\n                             seconds, that DRS interpreter\
    \ will be\n                             allowed to execute. The default value\
    \ for\n                             'RUN_TIME' is five minutes.\n   <formid> \
    \                 specifies the form which is to be applied\n                \
    \             to the Network data stream.\n   For each instance of <run parameters>,\
    \ one socket pair is allocated\n   and one form is specified.  In the case of\
    \ 'SIMPLEX' runs, the\n   Network data flows between these two sockets, with the\
    \ form being\n   applied to the data.  In the case of 'DUPLEX' runs, the connections\n\
    \   are somewhat more complex.  For 'DUPLEX' runs, two sets of <run\n   parameters>\
    \ are specified, causing two socket pairs to be allocated,\n   and two forms to\
    \ be specified.  Call these send socket 1, receive\n   socket 1, and form 1 (established\
    \ via the first set of <run\n   parameters> and send socket 2, receive socket\
    \ 2, and form 2\n   (established via the second set of parameters).  When interpreting\n\
    \   begins, data will flow from send socket 1, through form1, to receive\n   socket\
    \ 2, and from send socket 2, through form 2, to receive socket\n   1. (Note that\
    \ without this socket switching, processes would be\n   connected to themselves\
    \ when 'SICP' or 'UICP' is specified.)\n   The user is notified when his requests\
    \ for connections are initiated\n   and when the interpreter begins applying a\
    \ form to a connection.\n   When execution of a form terminates, the user is supplied\
    \ with a\n   diagnostic message provided by the interpreter as well as the actual\n\
    \   run time of the interpreter.\n   'SELECT' (<tty list>|<CA>) <CA>\n   Requests\
    \ DRS to establish unidirectional links between the user's\n   terminal and the\
    \ terminals specified in <tty list>.  If <tty list> is\n   omitted, DRS attempts\
    \ to link the user's terminal to all other active\n   terminals.  While the user's\
    \ terminal has another terminal selected,\n   all output to the user'S terminal\
    \ will also be routed to the selected\n   terminal.\n   ';' <text> <CA>\n   Allows\
    \ the user to enter any comments he chooses. <text> may include\n   the characters\
    \ '?', and '.'.  Note that <CA> must be CR-LF, rather\n   than period.\n     \
