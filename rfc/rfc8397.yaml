  - "1.  Introduction\n   The multiple-level feature of [IS-IS] can increase the scalability\
    \ of\n   TRILL as discussed in [RFC8243].  However, multilevel IS-IS needs\n \
    \  some extensions to support the TRILL multilevel feature.  The two\n   most\
    \ significant extensions are how TRILL switch nicknames are\n   managed and how\
    \ distribution trees are handled [RFC8243].\n   There are two primary alternatives\
    \ to realize TRILL multilevel\n   [RFC8243].  One approach, which is referred\
    \ to as the \"aggregated\n   nickname\" approach, involves assigning nicknames\
    \ to the areas, and\n   allowing nicknames to be reused in different areas by\
    \ having the\n   border TRILL switches rewrite nickname fields when entering or\n\
    \   leaving an area.  For more description of the aggregated nickname\n   approach,\
    \ one can refer to [RFC8243] and [SingleN].  The other\n   approach, which is\
    \ referred to as the \"unique nickname\" approach, is\n   specified in this document.\
    \  The unique nickname approach gives\n   unique nicknames to all the TRILL switches\
    \ in the multilevel campus\n   by having the TRILL switches at the Level 1 / Level\
    \ 2 border\n   advertise into the Level 1 area those nicknames are not available\
    \ for\n   assignment in that area and advertising into the Level 2 area those\n\
    \   nicknames that are used by the Level 1 area so that other areas\n   cannot\
    \ use them anymore.  The advertising of Level 1 nicknames\n   informs the rest\
    \ of the campus how to reach the nicknames residing in\n   that area.  In this\
    \ document, protocol extensions that support such\n   advertisement are specified.\n\
    \   Each RBridge in a unique nickname area calculates two types of trees:\n  \
    \ local distribution trees and global distributions trees.  For multi-\n   destination\
    \ traffic that is limited to an area, the packets will be\n   flooded on a local\
    \ distribution tree.  Otherwise, the multi-\n   destination packets will be flooded\
    \ along a global distribution tree.\n   In the unique nickname approach, nicknames\
    \ are globally valid so that\n   border RBridges do not rewrite the nickname field\
    \ of TRILL data\n   packets that transition between Level 1 and Level 2, as border\n\
    \   RBridges do in the aggregated nickname approach.  If a border RBridge\n  \
    \ is a transit node on a forwarding path, it does not learn MAC\n   addresses\
    \ of the TRILL data packets forwarded along this path.\n   Testing and maintenance\
    \ operations that originate in one area and\n   terminate in a different area\
    \ are also simplified [RFC8243].  For\n   these reasons, the unique nickname approach\
    \ might realize simpler\n   border RBridges than the aggregated nickname approach.\
    \  However, the\n   unique nickname approach is less scalable and may be less\
    \ well suited\n   for very large campuses.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Unicast Routing\n   The plain RBridge RB27 has a different view of the\
    \ topology of the\n   TRILL campus than its border RBridge RB2.  For an outward\
    \ path that\n   reaches an RBridge not in the same area (say, RB44), RB27 calculates\n\
    \   the segment of the path in Area X, the border RBridge RB2 calculates\n   the\
    \ segment in Level 2, while the border RBridge to the destination\n   area, RBridge\
    \ RB3, calculates the segment from itself to RB44.\n   Let us say that S transmits\
    \ a frame to destination D and let us say\n   that D's location is learned by\
    \ the relevant TRILL switches already.\n   These relevant switches have learned\
    \ the following:\n   1) RB27 has learned that D is connected to nickname 44.\n\
    \   2) RB2 has learned that nickname 44 is accessible through RB3.\n   The following\
    \ sequence of events will occur:\n   -  S transmits an Ethernet frame with source\
    \ MAC = S and destination\n      MAC = D.\n   -  RB27 encapsulates with a TRILL\
    \ header with ingress RBridge\n      nickname 27, and egress RBridge nickname\
    \ 44 producing a TRILL Data\n      packet.\n   -  RB2 has announced in the Level\
    \ 1 IS-IS instance in Area X that it\n      owns all nicknames of other areas,\
    \ including 44.  Therefore, IS-IS\n      routes the packet to RB2.\n   -  The\
    \ packet is forwarded through Level 2, from RB2 to RB3, which\n      has advertised,\
    \ in Level 2, it owns the nickname 44.\n   -  RB3, when forwarding into Area Y,\
    \ does not change the ingress\n      nickname 27 or the egress nickname 44.\n\

- title: 3.2.  Multi-destination Routing
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Multi-destination Routing\n   The scope of Multi-destination routing is\
    \ defined by the tree root\n   nickname.  A tree with a Level 2 tree root nickname\

    \ 4.2 for\n   the Level 1 and Level 2 nickname allocation.\n   Border RBridges\
    \ announce the global trees to be calculated only for\n   those Data Labels that\
    \ span across areas.  APPsub-TLVs as specified\n   in Section 3.2 of [RFC7968]\

    \ for a TRILL multi-\n   destination Data packet.\n   If there are legacy TRILL\
    \ switches that do not understand the APPsub-\n   TLVs for tree selection, configuration\
    \ MUST guarantee that Data\n   Labels [RFC7172] being used globally in Level 2\
    \ are disabled on these\n   legacy TRILL switches.  (Otherwise, the legacy TRILL\
    \ switches might\n   use local trees for multi-destination traffic with a global\
    \ scope.)\n   These legacy TRILL switches may use global trees to flood multi-\n\

    \ the\n   root.  Protocol behaviors for local distribution trees have been\n \
    \  specified in Section 4.5 of [RFC6325].  The sole difference is that\n   the\
    \ local distribution tree spans this area only.  A multi-\n   destination packet\
    \ with an egress nickname of the root RBridge of a\n   local tree MUST NOT be\

    \ tree root priority\n   advertises the set of global trees by providing a list\
    \ of Level 2\n   RBridge nicknames as defined in Section 4.5 of [RFC6325].\n \
    \  According to [RFC6325], the RBridge with the highest root priority\n   advertises\
    \ the tree roots for a Level 1 area.  There has to be a\n   border RBridge with\
    \ the highest root tree priority in each area so\n   that it can advertise the\
    \ global tree root nicknames into the area.\n   Also, this border RBridge MUST\
    \ advertise the set of local\n   distribution trees by providing another set of\
    \ nicknames.  Since\n   nicknames of global tree roots and local tree roots indicate\n\

    \   the same way except that (1) for a LAN link, the IS-IS Hellos used\n   are\
    \ Level 2 Hello PDUs [IS-IS] and (2) for a point-to-point link, the\n   Level\
    \ is configured and indicated in flags in the point-to-point\n   Hello.  The state\

  - "4.4.  Capability Indication\n   All border RBridges MUST understand the NickBlockFlags\
    \ APPsub-TLV.\n   Non-border RBridges in an area should understand the NickBlockFlags\n\
    \   APPsub-TLV.  If an RBridge within an area understands the\n   NickBlockFlags\

  contents:
  - "5.  Mix with Aggregated Nickname Areas\n   The design of TRILL multilevel allows\
    \ a mixture of unique nickname\n   areas and aggregated nickname areas (see Section\
    \ 1.2 of [RFC8243]).\n   Usage of nickname space MUST be planned so that nicknames\
    \ used in any\n   one unique nickname area and Level 2 are never used in any other\n\
    \   areas, including unique nickname areas as well as aggregated nickname\n  \
    \ areas.  In other words, nickname reusage is merely allowed among\n   aggregated\
    \ nickname areas.\n   Border RBridges of an aggregated area MUST announce nicknames\
    \ heard\n   from Level 2 into their area like just like a unique nickname border\n\
    \   RBridge.  However, these RBridges do not announce nicknames of their\n   area\
    \ into Level 2.\n   Each border RBridge of the aggregated areas will appear on\
    \ the global\n   tree, as specified in Section 4.1, as a single node.  The global\n\
    \   trees for unique nickname areas span unique nickname areas and Level\n   2\

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Since TRILL multilevel uses the existing IS-IS\
    \ multilevel facilities\n   [IS-IS], flooding of control traffic for link-state\
    \ information is\n   automatically confined to a Level 1 area or to Level 2 (except\
    \ for\n   limited types of information that can be specifically flagged for\n\
    \   wider flooding).  This addresses the TRILL scalability issues as\n   specified\
    \ in Section 2 of [RFC8243], and also, except for the wider\n   flooding case,\
    \ this confines the scope of the effects of malicious\n   events that could be\
    \ communicated through the link state.  However,\n   due to the fact that unique\
    \ nickname areas share a common nickname\n   space, border RBridges still have\
    \ to leak nickname information\n   between levels.  Such leaking means that nickname-related\
    \ events in\n   one area can affect other areas.\n   For this purpose, border\
    \ RBridges need to fabricate the nickname\n   announcements as specified in Section\
    \ 4.3.  Malicious devices may\n   also fake the NickBlockFlags APPsub-TLV to announce\
    \ a range of\n   nicknames.  By doing this, the attacker can attract TRILL data\n\
    \   packets that were originally sent to a bunch of other RBridges.  For\n   this\
    \ reason, RBridges SHOULD be configured to use the IS-IS\n   Authentication TLV\
    \ (10) in the IS-IS PDUs, particularly those\n   containing the NickBlockFlags\
    \ APPsub-TLV, so that IS-IS security\n   [RFC5310] can be used to authenticate\
    \ those PDUs and discard them if\n   they are forged.\n   If border RBridges do\
    \ not prune multi-destination distribution tree\n   traffic in Data Labels that\
    \ are configured to be area local, then\n   traffic that should have been contained\
    \ within an area might be\n   wrongly delivered to end stations in that Data Label\
    \ in other areas.\n   That is, the Data Label would no longer be area local. \
    \ This would\n   generally violate security constraints that require traffic to\
    \ be\n   delivered only to end stations in that Data Label in a single area.\n\
    \   For general TRILL Security Considerations, see [RFC6325].\n"
