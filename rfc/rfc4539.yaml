  - "1.  Introduction\n   The present document registers a media type for SMPTE Material\n\
    \   Exchange Format (MXF).  MXF, defined by SMPTE 377M [SMPTE377M], is a\n   standard\
    \ wrapper format developed for the interchange of audiovisual\n   material, including\
    \ both audiovisual essence and rich metadata.\n   Essence is the raw video, audio,\
    \ and data streams contained and\n   described by MXF.  Metadata carried by MXF\
    \ includes structural\n   metadata and descriptive metadata.  Structural metadata\
    \ relates to\n   the structure and capabilities of the MXF file and is generally\n\
    \   required for proper decoding.  Some examples of structural metadata\n   are\
    \ descriptions of essence types, information to help synchronize\n   playout of\
    \ audio and video, and content length.  Descriptive metadata\n   gives information\
    \ about the program content in the file and is not\n   essential for decoding.\
    \  Some examples of descriptive metadata are\n   program title, actors, and scene\
    \ descriptions.  The essence in MXF\n   files may itself carry data, such as vertical\
    \ blanking interval data\n   used for carriage of Closed Captioning and other\
    \ purposes.\n   MXF is an important tool in providing interoperation between\n\
    \   different video systems as well as digital cinema systems.  MXF also\n   aids\
    \ in the development of video production and distribution\n   workflows that are\
    \ more efficient, multi-vendor, file based, and IT\n   oriented.\n   SMPTE currently\
    \ has standards for the mapping of the following\n   essence types to the MXF\
    \ generic container: MPEG (including MPEG-1\n   and MPEG-2 video streams, as well\
    \ as MPEG audio), DV-DIF (Digital\n   Video Digital Interface Format for the DV\
    \ family of related video\n   encodings), Uncompressed Pictures, SDTI-CP (Serial\
    \ Digital Transport\n   Interface Content Package for delivering packetized audiovisual\n\
    \   content over the SDI interface), D-10 (a specialized video stream\n   incorporating\
    \ MPEG-2 4:2:2P@ML), D-11 (a high-definition video\n   compression standard),\
    \ AES3 audio, Broadcast Wave audio, and A-Law\n   audio.  The flexibility of the\
    \ MXF generic container allows for the\n   possibility of mappings of additional\
    \ essence types in the future.\n   The media type defined here is needed to correctly\
    \ identify MXF files\n   when they are served over HTTP or other network connections,\
    \ included\n   in multi-part documents, indexed by operating systems and digital\n\
    \   asset management systems, or used in other places where media types\n   are\
    \ used.\n"

    \   Subject: Registration of media type application/mxf\n   Type name: application\n\
    \   Subtype name: mxf\n   Required parameters: none\n   Optional parameters: ULs\n\
    \   The optional parameter ULs is a single Uniform Resource Name (URN),\n   or\
    \ a comma-separated list of multiple URNs of SMPTE Universal Labels\n   (which\
    \ are defined by SMPTE 400M [SMPTE400M]).\n   This optional parameter provides\
    \ hints to the decoder regarding the\n   structure of the MXF file, which could\
    \ include Operational Pattern,\n   essence types, descriptive metadata schemes,\
    \ and other elements that\n   are identified by their SMPTE Universal Label.\n\
    \   SMPTE Universal Labels are Object Identifiers (OIDs), as specified by\n  \
    \ [ASN1].  Thus, a URN of a SMPTE Universal Label can use the OID URN\n   namespace\
    \ specified in [RFC3061], or any other future URN namespace\n   that is appropriate\
    \ for SMPTE Universal Labels.\n   Note that, per [RFC2045], some characters (including\
    \ the comma used\n   to separate multiple values) require that the entire parameter\
    \ value\n   be enclosed in quotes.\n   Below is an example of use of the optional\
    \ parameter.  The two SMPTE\n   Universal Labels indicate that the MXF file uses\
    \ the OP1a Operational\n   Pattern and contains IEC DV video at 25 Mbps, 525 lines,\
    \ 59.94 fps\n   interlaced essence.\n      Content-Type:  application/mxf;\n \
    \        ULs=\"urn:oid:1.3.52.4.1.1.1.13.1.2.1.1.1,\n         urn:oid:1.3.52.4.1.1.1.4.1.2.2.2.1.1\"\
    \n   Encoding considerations: binary\n   Security considerations: Application/mxf\
    \ objects are not signed but\n   may be partially encrypted internally.  External\
    \ security mechanisms\n   must be employed to ensure content confidentiality.\
    \  MXF, through\n   metadata extensions, may allow executable code to be transferred\
    \ in\n   the file.  It is suggested that no unauthenticated executables\n   decoded\
    \ from an MXF file be executed.  Some compressed essence types\n   carried in\
    \ MXF may carry a risk that certain pathological bitstreams\n   could lead to\
    \ potential denial-of-service attacks against these\n   essence decoders.\n  \
    \ Interoperability considerations: MXF provides a standard wrapping for\n   a\
    \ number of audio and video essence types according to a number of\n   different\
    \ Operational Patterns (OP).  Thus, interoperability depends\n   upon whether\
    \ the MXF file decoder has the capability to match the\n   features of the MXF\
    \ file encoder.  An Application Specification (AS)\n   can ensure that MXF encoders\
    \ and decoders can interoperate\n   effectively.\n   Published specification:\
    \ RFC 4539, SMPTE 377M [SMPTE377M]\n   Applications that use this media type:\
    \ MXF is a wrapper for many\n   types of audio and video essence types in use\
    \ by many applications in\n   the broadcast and digital cinema industries.  These\
    \ include\n   non-linear editing systems, video servers, video camera systems,\n\
    \   digital asset management systems, and digital video distribution\n   systems.\n\
