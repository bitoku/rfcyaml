Abstract This document describes a method for distributing a MARS service within a LIS[1].
This method uses the Server Cache Synchronization Protocol (SCSP)[2] to synchronize the MARS Server databases within a LIS.
When SCSP is used to synchronize the caches of MARS Servers in a LIS, the LIS defines the boundary of an SCSP Server Group (SG).
The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL,
SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in [5].
The MARS is an extended analog of the ATMARP Server introduced in [4].
It provides the necessary connection and addressing services required by layer 3 multicast services over ATM.
There are three basic elements to the MARS model.
First, the MARS Server which manages and distributes layer 3 group membership information to the LIS.
Second, MARS Clients which register with and query a single MARS Server for layer 3 multicast information.
Third, MCS Clients which register with a single MARS Server and provide layer 3 multicast forwarding services for a LIS.
Both MARS Clients and MCS Clients explicitly register with the MARS Server before exchanging layer 3 multicast information.
During the registration process MARS Clients are place on the Cluster Control VC (CCVC) and MCS Clients are placed on the Server Control VC (SCVC).
Both the CCVC and SCVC are then used to propagate layer 3 multicast updates to the clients which make up a LIS.
During the registration process MARS Clients are also assigned a unique Cluster Member ID (CMI) which is used to identify reflected packets in the presence of MCS Clients.
In the Distributed MARS Model there MAY be multiple MARS Servers in a given LIS, and since any MARS Server within the LIS MUST be able to provide layer 3 multicast information about any multicast group within the LIS, there MUST be a method by which to synchronize multicast information across all MARS Servers within the LIS.
The Server Cache Synchronization Protocol (SCSP) solves the generalized server synchronization/cache replication problem for distributed databases, and thus SCSP MAY be applied to the MARS Server database synchronization problem within a LIS.
When SCSP is used to synchronize the caches of MARS Servers in a LIS, the LIS defines the boundary of and SCSP Server Group (SG).
SCSP is defined in two parts: the protocol independent part and the client/server protocol specific part.
The protocol independent part is specified in [2] whereas this document will specify the client/server protocol specific part where the MARS Server is the client/server protocol.
All MARS Servers belonging to a LIS are said to belong to a Server Group (SG).
A SG is identified by, not surprisingly, its SGID which is contained in a field in all SCSP packets.
All SCSP packets contain a Protocol ID (PID) field as well.
This PID field is set to 0x0003 to signify that SCSP is synchronizing MARS Server databases as opposed to synchronizing some other protocol's databases.
(see Section B.2.0.1 of [2] for more details).
In general, PIDs for SCSP will be assigned by IANA upon request given that a client/server protocol specific specification has been written.
In the case of MARS Servers, the client/server protocol specific specification was written at the same time as SCSP, and thus a PID 0x0003 was assigned in [2].
SCSP places no topological requirements upon a MARS Server SG.
Obviously, however, the resultant graph of MARS Servers must span the set of MARS Servers being synchronized.
For more information about the client/server protocol independent part of SCSP, the reader is encouraged to see [2].
When a SG is using SCSP for synchronization, a MARS Client or MCS Client will register with only one MARS Server although it is allowed to choose any MARS Server in the SG for this registration.
At registration time the MARS Client or MCS Client will be added to that MARS Servers respective CCVC or SCVC.
Also, MARS Clients will be issued a unique CMI for the entire LIS.
This document assumes at a minimum
each MARS Server in the SG will be configured with a unique range of CMIs to assign to clients registering with that MARS Server.
Use of some external means for allocating CMIs to MARS Servers in a SG is possible but beyond the scope of this document.
When a MARS Client or MCS Client successfully registers with a MARS Server in the SG that MARS Server will propagate the registration information to its peer MARS Servers.
The same propagation will occur for any subsequent group membership information learned from the clients.
The peer MARS Server will then update its group membership database and propagate the information out its own CCVC or SCVC if needed.
In the case of a MARS Server failure all peer MARS Servers in the SG MUST flush the client/group membership information learned from the failed MARS Server.
The clients belonging to the failed MARS Servers CCVC and SCVC will migrate to the next available MARS Server as specified in Section 5.3 of [1].
When a client detects a failure of its MARS, it steps to the next backup MARS Server and attempts to register with the server.
If the registration is successful the client will re join all of its previous group membership information.
If the registration fails, the process repeats until a functional MARS Server is found.
Determining the operational state of a MARS Servers in a SG requires that each MARS Server send out an "alive" or "heartbeat" message similar to the MARS Redirect message sent out on the CCVC or SCVC for MARS Clients.
However, this message will only be sent to MARS Servers in the SG and is from here on defined as the MARS Server Redirect Entry.
In order to detect that a MARS Server failure has occurred each server MUST update it's MARS Server Redirect Entry state at least every 2 minutes, it is RECOMMENDED that it is updated every 1 minute.
Failure to receive two consecutive MARS Server Redirect Entry updates from a given MARS Server in the SG will cause all membership information learned from this server to be flushed.
The MARS Server Redirect Entry state is also used to create the MARS REDIRECT MAP messages sent out on CCVC for each MARS Server in the SG.
The ordering of each server learned will be based on the MARS Servers SCSP Sender ID.
The ordering of the MARS REDIRECT MAP will first contain the list of MARS Servers learned via MARS Server Redirect Entry updates in ascending order based on the SCSP Sender ID, followed by any externally configured or learned backup MARS Servers.
In the case of a MARS Client or MCS Client failure where the client is unexpectedly removed from the CCVC or SCVC
the MARS Server MUST notify its peer SG members via a proxy deregister for that client.
Upon receiving a proxy deregister request from a peer SG member all membership information for the deregistering client MUST be removed.
Any Clients sending multicast data to the failed client should also receive an unexpected removal of this client which will intern cause the sending client to revalidate the multicast groups current membership as outlined in Section 5.1.5.1 of [1].

An MCS Client can only register with one MARS Server in the SG and is only placed on the SCVC for the MARS Server for which it is registered with.
When a MCS Client Serve/Register request specifying a group address is received by a MARS Server it MUST create a cache entry associated with this client.
In addition to adding the cache entry it MUST send out a MARS MIGRATE message on it's CCVC.
This is needed so that clients using a mesh topology can migrate to a server based topology.
Details regarding the MARS MIGRATE message can be found in Section 5.1.6 of [1].

When a MARS Client Join/Register request is sent with the mar$flags.register bit set to 1 all of the servers in the SG will create a cache entry for this client using the information in the request.
When a registered MARS Client issues a MARS JOIN for a specific group address range a MARS
Client Join/Register request MUST be sent to the servers in the SG.
The actions taken by each server in the SG depend on previous group membership actions and MCS supported groups.
Each MARS Server MUST perform the necessary redistribution and hole punching algorithms before propagating this request to the CCVC and SCVC on each server.
The redistribution and hole punching algorithms used for propagating join requests to the CCVC are the same as defined in Sections 6.1.2 and 6.2.4 of [1].
If the originating MARS JOIN request is a duplicate of a previously joined range or contains no group address range than a MARS
Client Join/Register MUST NOT be sent to the SG.
The redistribution and hole punching algorithms used for propagating join requests as MARS SJOIN request on a SCVC is the same as Section 6.2.4 except for the following.
Only the MARS Servers which contain the registered MCS Clients for the target group ranges should propagate this information to their SCVCs.
5.4  MARS Client Leave/Deregister request.
The MARS Client Leave/Deregister request is used to propagate the deregistering or leaving of specific group ranges by registered MARS Clients within the SG domain.
It is similar to the MARS LEAVE request defined in Sections 5.2.1 to 5.2.3 of [1].
When a MARS Server in the SG successfully deregisters a registered MARS Client or a registered client leaves a specific group address range for which it had joined the MARS
Server MUST send a MARS Client Leave/Deregister request to the SG.
If a registered MARS Client is unexpectedly removed from the CCVC the MARS
Server MUST act as a proxy and send a MARS Client Leave/Deregister request to the SG.
The format and meanings of the fields in a MARS
Client Leave/Deregister request are the same as in Section 5.3 except the State is coded as 4 decimal for a MARS Client Leave/Deregister request.
When a MARS Client Leave/Deregister request is sent with the mar$flags.register bit set to 1 all of the servers in the SG
receiving this update MUST purge all cache entries for this client.
When a registered MARS Client issues a MARS LEAVE for a specific group address
range a MARS Client LEAVE/
Deregister request MUST be sent to the servers in the SG.
The actions taken by each server in the SG depend on previous group membership actions and MCS supported groups.
Each MARS Server MUST perform the necessary redistribution and hole punching algorithms before propagating this request to the CCVC and SCVC on each server.
The redistribution and hole punching algorithms used for propagating leave requests to the CCVC are the same as defined in Sections 6.1.2 and 6.2.4 of [1].
If the originating MARS LEAVE request does not correspond to a previously joined range or contains no group address range than a MARS
Client Leave/Deregister MUST NOT be sent to the SG.
The redistribution and hole punching algorithms used for propagating leave requests as MARS SLEAVE requests on a SCVC is the same as Section 6.2.4 except for the following.
Only the MARS Servers which contain the registered MCS Clients for the target group ranges should propagate this information to their SCVCs.
The MCS Unserve/Deregister request is used to propagate the deregistering or unservicing of specific groups by a registered MCS Client within the SG domain.
It is similar to an MARS MUNSERV request defined in Section 6.2.2 and 6.2.3 of [1].
When a MARS Server in the SG successfully deregisters a registered MCS Client or registered MCS Client stops serving a specific group address range for which it had serviced the MARS Server MUST send a MCS Unserve/Deregister request to the SG.
If a registered MCS Client is unexpectedly removed from the SCVC
the MARS Server owning the SCVC MUST act as a proxy and send a MCS Unserve/Deregister request to the SG.
The format and meanings of the fields in a MCS Unserve/Deregister request are the same as in Section 5.2 except the State is coded as 5 decimal for a MCS Unserve/Deregister request.
When a MCS Client Unserve/Deregister request is sent with the mar$flags.register bit set to 1 all of the servers in the SG receiving this update MUST purge all cache entries for this client.
When a registered MCS Client issues a MARS MUNSERV for
a specific group address range being served
a MCS Client Unserve/Deregister request MUST be sent to the servers in the SG.
The members of the SG that receive this update must then clear the cache entry associated with this MCS Client.
In addition to clearing one or more cache entries associated with receiving a  MCS Client Unserve/Deregister request each MARS
Server in the SG MUST send out a MARS LEAVE message on it's CCVC in order for clients to change back to a mesh topology.
There is no mechanism to encrypt the CSA Record MARS Specific Part of the message exchanged between servers.
However, there are base SCSP security features in the SCSP Protocol Independent part [2] which can be used to protect against attacks.
Any SCSP MARS is susceptible to Denial of Service (DOS) attacks.
A rouge MARS Client can inundate its Server with MARS packets.
This is a base MARS problem as currently defined by [1].
A rouge host can also inundate its neighboring SCSP MARS with SCSP packets.
However, if the authentication option is used, the SCSP MARS databases will not become corrupted, as the bogus packets will be discarded when the authentication check fails.
Due to the pair wise authentication model of SCSP MARS, the information received from any properly authenticated server is trusted and propagated throughout the server group.
Consequently, if security of any SCSP MARS server is compromised, the entire database becomes vulnerable to corruption originating from the compromised server.
