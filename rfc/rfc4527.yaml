  - "1.  Background and Intent of Use\n   This document specifies an extension to
    the Lightweight Directory\n   Access Protocol (LDAP) [RFC4510] to allow the client
    to read the\n   target entry of an update operation (e.g., Add, Delete, Modify,\n
    \  ModifyDN).  The extension utilizes controls [RFC4511] attached to\n   update
    requests to request and return copies of the target entry.\n   One request control,
    called the Pre-Read request control, indicates\n   that a copy of the entry before
    application of update is to be\n   returned.  Another control, called the Post-Read
    request control,\n   indicates that a copy of the entry after application of the
    update is\n   to be returned.  Each request control has a corresponding response\n
    \  control used to return the entry.\n   To ensure proper isolation, the controls
    are processed as an atomic\n   part of the update operation.\n   The functionality
    offered by these controls is based upon similar\n   functionality in the X.500
    Directory Access Protocol (DAP) [X.511].\n   The Pre-Read controls may be used
    to obtain replaced or deleted\n   values of modified attributes or a copy of the
    entry being deleted.\n   The Post-Read controls may be used to obtain values of
    operational\n   attributes, such as the 'entryUUID' [RFC4530] and 'modifyTimestamp'\n
    \  [RFC4512] attributes, updated by the server as part of the update\n   operation.\n"
  title: 1.  Background and Intent of Use
- contents:
  - "2. Terminology\n   Protocol elements are described using ASN.1 [X.680] with implicit\n
    \  tags.  The term \"BER-encoded\" means the element is to be encoded\n   using
    the Basic Encoding Rules [X.690] under the restrictions\n   detailed in Section
    5.1 of [RFC4511].\n   DN stands for Distinguished Name.\n   DSA stands for Directory
    System Agent (i.e., a directory server).\n   DSE stands for DSA-specific Entry.\n
    \  In this document, the key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",\n   \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",\n   and \"OPTIONAL\"
    are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14\n   [RFC2119].\n"

    - "3.1.  The Pre-Read Controls\n   The Pre-Read request and response controls
      are identified by the\n   1.3.6.1.1.13.1 object identifier.  Servers implementing
      these\n   controls SHOULD publish 1.3.6.1.1.13.1 as a value of the\n   'supportedControl'
      [RFC4512] in their root DSE.\n   The Pre-Read request control is a LDAP Control
      [RFC4511] whose\n   controlType is 1.3.6.1.1.13.1 and whose controlValue is
      a BER-encoded\n   AttributeSelection [RFC4511], as extended by [RFC3673].  The\n
      \  criticality may be TRUE or FALSE.  This control is appropriate for\n   the
      modifyRequest, delRequest, and modDNRequest LDAP messages.\n   The corresponding
      response control is a LDAP Control whose\n   controlType is 1.3.6.1.1.13.1 and
      whose the controlValue, an OCTET\n   STRING, contains a BER-encoded SearchResultEntry.
      \ The criticality\n   may be TRUE or FALSE.  This control is appropriate for
      the\n   modifyResponse, delResponse, and modDNResponse LDAP messages with a\n
      \  resultCode of success (0).\n   When the request control is attached to an
      appropriate update LDAP\n   request, the control requests the return of a copy
      of the target\n   entry prior to the application of the update.  The AttributeSelection\n
      \  indicates, as discussed in [RFC4511][RFC3673], which attributes are\n   requested
      to appear in the copy.  The server is to return a\n   SearchResultEntry containing,
      subject to access controls and other\n   constraints, values of the requested
      attributes.\n   The normal processing of the update operation and the processing
      of\n   this control MUST be performed as one atomic action isolated from\n   other
      update operations.\n   If the update operation fails (in either normal or control\n
      \  processing), no Pre-Read response control is provided.\n"
