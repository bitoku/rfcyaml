- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   A means of indicating the relationships between resources\
    \ on the Web,\n   as well as indicating the type of those relationships, has been\n\
    \   available for some time in HTML [W3C.REC-html401-19991224], and more\n   recently\
    \ in Atom [RFC4287].  These mechanisms, although conceptually\n   similar, are\
    \ separately specified.  However, links between resources\n   need not be format\
    \ specific; it can be useful to have typed links\n   that are independent of their\
    \ serialisation, especially when a\n   resource has representations in multiple\
    \ formats.\n   To this end, this document defines a framework for typed links\
    \ that\n   isn't specific to a particular serialisation or application.  It does\n\
    \   so by redefining the link relation registry established by Atom to\n   have\
    \ a broader domain, and adding to it the relations that are\n   defined by HTML.\n\
    \   Furthermore, an HTTP header field for conveying typed links was\n   defined\
    \ in Section 19.6.2.4 of [RFC2068], but removed from [RFC2616],\n   due to a lack\
    \ of implementation experience.  Since then, it has been\n   implemented in some\
    \ User Agents (e.g., for stylesheets), and several\n   additional use cases have\
    \ surfaced.\n   Because it was removed, the status of the Link header is unclear,\n\
    \   leading some to consider minting new application-specific HTTP\n   headers\
    \ instead of reusing it.  This document addresses this by re-\n   specifying the\
    \ Link header as one such serialisation, with updated\n   but backwards-compatible\
    \ syntax.\n"
- title: 2.  Notational Conventions
  contents:
  - "2.  Notational Conventions\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in BCP 14, [RFC2119], as\n   scoped to those conformance targets.\n   This document\
    \ uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of\n   [RFC2616], and explicitly\
    \ includes the following rules from it:\n   quoted-string, token, SP (space),\
    \ LOALPHA, DIGIT.\n   Additionally, the following rules are included from [RFC3986]:\
    \ URI\n   and URI-Reference; from [RFC4288]: type-name and subtype-name; from\n\
    \   [W3C.REC-html401-19991224]: MediaDesc; from [RFC5646]: Language-Tag;\n   and\
    \ from [RFC5987], ext-value and parmname.\n"
- title: 3.  Links
  contents:
  - "3.  Links\n   In this specification, a link is a typed connection between two\n\
    \   resources that are identified by Internationalised Resource\n   Identifiers\
    \ (IRIs) [RFC3987], and is comprised of:\n   o  A context IRI,\n   o  a link relation\
    \ type (Section 4),\n   o  a target IRI, and\n   o  optionally, target attributes.\n\
    \   A link can be viewed as a statement of the form \"{context IRI} has a\n  \
    \ {relation type} resource at {target IRI}, which has {target\n   attributes}\"\
    .\n   Note that in the common case, the context IRI will also be a URI\n   [RFC3986],\
    \ because many protocols (such as HTTP) do not support\n   dereferencing IRIs.\
    \  Likewise, the target IRI will be converted to a\n   URI (see [RFC3987], Section\
    \ 3.1) in serialisations that do not\n   support IRIs (e.g., the Link header).\n\
    \   This specification does not place restrictions on the cardinality of\n   links;\
    \ there can be multiple links to and from a particular IRI, and\n   multiple links\
    \ of different types between two given IRIs.  Likewise,\n   the relative ordering\
    \ of links in any particular serialisation, or\n   between serialisations (e.g.,\
    \ the Link header and in-content links)\n   is not specified or significant in\
    \ this specification; applications\n   that wish to consider ordering significant\
    \ can do so.\n   Target attributes are a set of key/value pairs that describe\
    \ the link\n   or its target; for example, a media type hint.  This specification\n\
    \   does not attempt to coordinate their names or use, but does provide\n   common\
    \ target attributes for use in the Link HTTP header.\n   Finally, this specification\
    \ does not define a general syntax for\n   expressing links, nor does it mandate\
    \ a specific context for any\n   given link; it is expected that serialisations\
    \ of links will specify\n   both aspects.  One such serialisation is communication\
    \ of links\n   through HTTP headers, specified in Section 5.\n"
- title: 4.  Link Relation Types
  contents:
  - "4.  Link Relation Types\n   In the simplest case, a link relation type identifies\
    \ the semantics\n   of a link.  For example, a link with the relation type \"\
    copyright\"\n   indicates that the resource identified by the target IRI is a\n\
    \   statement of the copyright terms applying to the current context IRI.\n  \
    \ Link relation types can also be used to indicate that the target\n   resource\
    \ has particular attributes, or exhibits particular\n   behaviours; for example,\
    \ a \"service\" link implies that the identified\n   resource is part of a defined\
    \ protocol (in this case, a service\n   description).\n   Relation types are not\
    \ to be confused with media types [RFC4288];\n   they do not identify the format\
    \ of the representation that results\n   when the link is dereferenced.  Rather,\
    \ they only describe how the\n   current context is related to another resource.\n\
    \   Relation types SHOULD NOT infer any additional semantics based upon\n   the\
    \ presence or absence of another link relation type, or its own\n   cardinality\
    \ of occurrence.  An exception to this is the combination\n   of the \"alternate\"\
    \ and \"stylesheet\" registered relation types, which\n   has special meaning\
    \ in HTML4 for historical reasons.\n   There are two kinds of relation types:\
    \ registered and extension.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Registered Relation Types
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Registered Relation Types\n   Well-defined relation types can be registered\
    \ as tokens for\n   convenience and/or to promote reuse by other applications.\
    \  This\n   specification establishes an IANA registry of such relation types;\n\
    \   see Section 6.2.\n   Registered relation type names MUST conform to the reg-rel-type\
    \ rule,\n   and MUST be compared character-by-character in a case-insensitive\n\
    \   fashion.  They SHOULD be appropriate to the specificity of the\n   relation\
    \ type; i.e., if the semantics are highly specific to a\n   particular application,\
    \ the name should reflect that, so that more\n   general names are available for\
    \ less specific use.\n   Registered relation types MUST NOT constrain the media\
    \ type of the\n   context IRI, and MUST NOT constrain the available representation\n\
    \   media types of the target IRI.  However, they can specify the\n   behaviours\
    \ and properties of the target resource (e.g., allowable\n   HTTP methods, request\
    \ and response media types that must be\n   supported).\n   Additionally, specific\
    \ applications of linking may require additional\n   data to be included in the\
    \ registry.  For example, Web browsers might\n   want to know what kinds of links\
    \ should be downloaded when they\n   archive a Web page; if this application-specific\
    \ information is in\n   the registry, new link relation types can control this\
    \ behaviour\n   without unnecessary coordination.\n   To accommodate this, per-entry\
    \ application data can be added to the\n   Link Relation Type registry, by registering\
    \ it in the Link Relation\n   Application Data registry (Section 6.3).\n"
- title: 4.2.  Extension Relation Types
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Extension Relation Types\n   Applications that don't wish to register a\
    \ relation type can use an\n   extension relation type, which is a URI [RFC3986]\
    \ that uniquely\n   identifies the relation type.  Although the URI can point\
    \ to a\n   resource that contains a definition of the semantics of the relation\n\
    \   type, clients SHOULD NOT automatically access that resource to avoid\n   overburdening\
    \ its server.\n   When extension relation types are compared, they MUST be compared\
    \ as\n   strings (after converting to URIs if serialised in a different\n   format,\
    \ such as a Curie [W3C.CR-curie-20090116]) in a case-\n   insensitive fashion,\
    \ character-by-character.  Because of this, all-\n   lowercase URIs SHOULD be\
    \ used for extension relations.\n   Note that while extension relation types are\
    \ required to be URIs, a\n   serialisation of links can specify that they are\
    \ expressed in another\n   form, as long as they can be converted to URIs.\n"
- title: 5.  The Link Header Field
  contents:
  - "5.  The Link Header Field\n   The Link entity-header field provides a means for\
    \ serialising one or\n   more links in HTTP headers.  It is semantically equivalent\

- title: 5.1.  Target IRI
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Target IRI\n   Each link-value conveys one target IRI as a URI-Reference\
    \ (after\n   conversion to one, if necessary; see [RFC3987], Section 3.1) inside\n\
    \   angle brackets (\"<>\").  If the URI-Reference is relative, parsers\n   MUST\
    \ resolve it as per [RFC3986], Section 5.  Note that any base IRI\n   from the\
    \ message's content is not applied.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Context IRI
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Context IRI\n   By default, the context of a link conveyed in the Link\
    \ header field\n   is the IRI of the requested resource.\n   When present, the\
    \ anchor parameter overrides this with another URI,\n   such as a fragment of\
    \ this resource, or a third resource (i.e., when\n   the anchor value is an absolute\
    \ URI).  If the anchor parameter's\n   value is a relative URI, parsers MUST resolve\
    \ it as per [RFC3986],\n   Section 5.  Note that any base URI from the body's\
    \ content is not\n   applied.\n   Consuming implementations can choose to ignore\
    \ links with an anchor\n   parameter.  For example, the application in use may\
    \ not allow the\n   context IRI to be assigned to a different resource.  In such\
    \ cases,\n   the entire link is to be ignored; consuming implementations MUST\
    \ NOT\n   process the link without applying the anchor.\n   Note that depending\
    \ on HTTP status code and response headers, the\n   context IRI might be \"anonymous\"\
    \ (i.e., no context IRI is available).\n   For instance, this is the case on a\
    \ 404 response to a GET request.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Relation Type
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Relation Type\n   The relation type of a link is conveyed in the \"rel\"\
    \ parameter's\n   value.  The \"rel\" parameter MUST NOT appear more than once\
    \ in a given\n   link-value; occurrences after the first MUST be ignored by parsers.\n\
    \   The \"rev\" parameter has been used in the past to indicate that the\n   semantics\
    \ of the relationship are in the reverse direction.  That is,\n   a link from\
    \ A to B with REL=\"X\" expresses the same relationship as a\n   link from B to\
    \ A with REV=\"X\". \"rev\" is deprecated by this\n   specification because it\
    \ often confuses authors and readers; in most\n   cases, using a separate relation\
    \ type is preferable.\n   Note that extension relation types are REQUIRED to be\
    \ absolute URIs\n   in Link headers, and MUST be quoted if they contain a semicolon\
    \ (\";\")\n   or comma (\",\") (as these characters are used as delimiters in\
    \ the\n   header itself).\n"
- title: 5.4.  Target Attributes
  contents:
  - "5.4.  Target Attributes\n   The \"hreflang\", \"media\", \"title\", \"title*\"\
    , \"type\", and any link-\n   extension link-params are considered to be target\
    \ attributes for the\n   link.\n   The \"hreflang\" parameter, when present, is\
    \ a hint indicating what the\n   language of the result of dereferencing the link\
    \ should be.  Note\n   that this is only a hint; for example, it does not override\
    \ the\n   Content-Language header of a HTTP response obtained by actually\n  \
    \ following the link.  Multiple \"hreflang\" parameters on a single link-\n  \
    \ value indicate that multiple languages are available from the\n   indicated\
    \ resource.\n   The \"media\" parameter, when present, is used to indicate intended\n\
    \   destination medium or media for style information (see\n   [W3C.REC-html401-19991224],\
    \ Section 6.13).  Note that this may be\n   updated by [W3C.CR-css3-mediaqueries-20090915]).\
    \  Its value MUST be\n   quoted if it contains a semicolon (\";\") or comma (\"\
    ,\"), and there\n   MUST NOT be more than one \"media\" parameter in a link-value.\n\
    \   The \"title\" parameter, when present, is used to label the destination\n\
    \   of a link such that it can be used as a human-readable identifier\n   (e.g.,\
    \ a menu entry) in the language indicated by the Content-\n   Language header\
    \ (if present).  The \"title\" parameter MUST NOT appear\n   more than once in\
    \ a given link-value; occurrences after the first\n   MUST be ignored by parsers.\n\
    \   The \"title*\" parameter can be used to encode this label in a\n   different\
    \ character set, and/or contain language information as per\n   [RFC5987].  The\
    \ \"title*\" parameter MUST NOT appear more than once in\n   a given link-value;\
    \ occurrences after the first MUST be ignored by\n   parsers.  If the parameter\
    \ does not contain language information, its\n   language is indicated by the\
    \ Content-Language header (when present).\n   If both the \"title\" and \"title*\"\
    \ parameters appear in a link-value,\n   processors SHOULD use the \"title*\"\
    \ parameter's value.\n   The \"type\" parameter, when present, is a hint indicating\
    \ what the\n   media type of the result of dereferencing the link should be. \
    \ Note\n   that this is only a hint; for example, it does not override the\n \
    \  Content-Type header of a HTTP response obtained by actually following\n   the\
    \ link.  There MUST NOT be more than one type parameter in a link-\n   value.\n"
- title: 5.5.  Examples
  contents:
  - "5.5.  Examples\n   For example:\n   Link: <http://example.com/TheBook/chapter2>;\
    \ rel=\"previous\";\n         title=\"previous chapter\"\n   indicates that \"\
    chapter2\" is previous to this resource in a logical\n   navigation path.\n  \
    \ Similarly,\n   Link: </>; rel=\"http://example.net/foo\"\n   indicates that\
    \ the root resource (\"/\") is related to this resource\n   with the extension\
    \ relation type \"http://example.net/foo\".\n   The example below shows an instance\

  - "6.2.  Link Relation Type Registry\n   This specification establishes the Link\
    \ Relation Type registry, and\n   updates Atom [RFC4287] to refer to it in place\
    \ of the \"Registry of\n   Link Relations\".\n   The underlying registry data\
    \ (e.g., the XML file) must include\n   Simplified BSD License text as described\
    \ in Section 4.e of the Trust\n   Legal Provisions (<http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info>).\n"
- title: 6.2.1.  Registering New Link Relation Types
  contents:
  - "6.2.1.  Registering New Link Relation Types\n   Relation types are registered\
    \ on the advice of a Designated Expert\n   (appointed by the IESG or their delegate),\
    \ with a Specification\n   Required (using terminology from [RFC5226]).\n   The\
    \ requirements for registered relation types are described in\n   Section 4.1.\n\
    \   Registration requests consist of the completed registration template\n   below,\
    \ typically published in an RFC or Open Standard (in the sense\n   described by\
    \ [RFC2026], Section 7).  However, to allow for the\n   allocation of values prior\
    \ to publication, the Designated Expert may\n   approve registration once they\
    \ are satisfied that a specification\n   will be published.\n   Note that relation\
    \ types can be registered by third parties, if the\n   Designated Expert determines\
    \ that an unregistered relation type is\n   widely deployed and not likely to\
    \ be registered in a timely manner.\n   The registration template is:\n   o  Relation\
    \ Name:\n   o  Description:\n   o  Reference:\n   o  Notes: [optional]\n   o \
    \ Application Data: [optional]\n   Registration requests should be sent to the\
    \ link-relations@ietf.org\n   mailing list, marked clearly in the subject line\
    \ (e.g., \"NEW RELATION\n   - example\" to register an \"example\" relation type).\n\
    \   Within at most 14 days of the request, the Designated Expert(s) will\n   either\
    \ approve or deny the registration request, communicating this\n   decision to\
    \ the review list and IANA.  Denials should include an\n   explanation and, if\
    \ applicable, suggestions as to how to make the\n   request successful.\n   Decisions\
    \ (or lack thereof) made by the Designated Expert can be\n   first appealed to\
    \ Application Area Directors (contactable using\n   app-ads@tools.ietf.org email\
    \ address or directly by looking up their\n   email addresses on http://www.iesg.org/\
    \ website) and, if the\n   appellant is not satisfied with the response, to the\
    \ full IESG (using\n   the iesg@iesg.org mailing list).\n   IANA should only accept\
    \ registry updates from the Designated\n   Expert(s), and should direct all requests\
    \ for registration to the\n   review mailing list.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The content of the Link header field is not secure,\
    \ private or\n   integrity-guaranteed, and due caution should be exercised when\
    \ using\n   it.  Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) with HTTP ([RFC2818] and\n\
    \   [RFC2817]) is currently the only end-to-end way to provide such\n   protection.\n\
    \   Applications that take advantage of typed links should consider the\n   attack\
    \ vectors opened by automatically following, trusting, or\n   otherwise using\
    \ links gathered from HTTP headers.  In particular,\n   Link headers that use\
    \ the \"anchor\" parameter to associate a link's\n   context with another resource\
    \ should be treated with due caution.\n   The Link entity-header field makes extensive\
    \ use of IRIs and URIs.\n   See [RFC3987] for security considerations relating\
    \ to IRIs.  See\n   [RFC3986] for security considerations relating to URIs.  See\n\

    \  This includes the Link\n   HTTP header.\n   Similarly, the anchor parameter\
    \ of the Link header does not support\n   IRIs, and therefore IRIs must be converted\
    \ to URIs before inclusion\n   there.\n   Relation types are defined as URIs,\

- title: Appendix A.  Notes on Using the Link Header with the HTML4 Format
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Notes on Using the Link Header with the HTML4 Format\n   HTML motivated\
    \ the original syntax of the Link header, and many of\n   the design decisions\
    \ in this document are driven by a desire to stay\n   compatible with these uses.\n\
    \   In HTML4, the link element can be mapped to links as specified here\n   by\
    \ using the \"href\" attribute for the target URI, and \"rel\" to convey\n   the\
    \ relation type, as in the Link header.  The context of the link is\n   the URI\
    \ associated with the entire HTML document.\n   All of the link relation types\
    \ defined by HTML4 have been included in\n   the Link Relation Type registry,\
    \ so they can be used without\n   modification.  However, there are several potential\
    \ ways to serialise\n   extension relation types into HTML4, including\n   o \
    \ As absolute URIs,\n   o  using the document-wide \"profile\" attribute's URI\
    \ as a prefix for\n      relation types, or\n   o  using the RDFa [W3C.REC-rdfa-syntax-20081014]\
    \ convention of\n      mapping token prefixes to URIs (in a manner similar to\
    \ XML name\n      spaces) (note that RDFa is only defined to work in XHTML\n \
    \     [W3C.REC-xhtml-basic-20080729], but is sometimes used in HTML4).\n   Individual\
    \ applications of linking will therefore need to define how\n   their extension\
    \ links should be serialised into HTML4.\n   Surveys of existing HTML content\
    \ have shown that unregistered link\n   relation types that are not URIs are (perhaps\
    \ inevitably) common.\n   Consuming HTML implementations should not consider such\
    \ unregistered\n   short links to be errors, but rather relation types with a\
    \ local\n   scope (i.e., their meaning is specific and perhaps private to that\n\
    \   document).\n   HTML4 also defines several attributes on links that are not\n\
    \   explicitly defined by the Link header.  These attributes can be\n   serialised\
    \ as link-extensions to maintain fidelity.\n   Finally, the HTML4 specification\
    \ gives a special meaning when the\n   \"alternate\" and \"stylesheet\" relation\
    \ types coincide in the same\n   link.  Such links should be serialised in the\
    \ Link header using a\n   single list of relation-types (e.g., rel=\"alternate\
    \ stylesheet\") to\n   preserve this relationship.\n"
- title: Appendix B.  Notes on Using the Link Header with the Atom Format
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.  Notes on Using the Link Header with the Atom Format\n   Atom conveys\
    \ links in the atom:link element, with the \"href\"\n   attribute indicating the\
    \ target IRI and the \"rel\" attribute\n   containing the relation type.  The\
    \ context of the link is either a\n   feed IRI or an entry ID, depending on where\
    \ it appears; generally,\n   feed-level links are obvious candidates for transmission\
    \ as a Link\n   header.\n   When serialising an atom:link into a Link header,\
    \ it is necessary to\n   convert target IRIs (if used) to URIs.\n   Atom defines\
    \ extension relation types in terms of IRIs.  This\n   specification re-defines\
    \ them as URIs, to simplify and reduce errors\n   in their comparison.\n   Atom\
    \ allows registered link relation types to be serialised as\n   absolute URIs.\
    \  Such relation types SHOULD be converted to the\n   appropriate registered form\
    \ (e.g.,\n   \"http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/self\" to \"self\") so\
    \ that\n   they are not mistaken for extension relation types.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ Atom link relation types are always compared in a case-\n   sensitive fashion;\
    \ therefore, registered link relation types SHOULD\n   be converted to their registered\
    \ form (usually, lowercase) when\n   serialised in an Atom document.\n   Note\
    \ also that while the Link header allows multiple relations to be\n   serialised\
    \ in a single link, atom:link does not.  In this case, a\n   single link-value\
    \ may map to several atom:link elements.\n   As with HTML, atom:link defines some\
    \ attributes that are not\n   explicitly mirrored in the Link header syntax, but\
    \ they can also be\n   used as link-extensions to maintain fidelity.\n"
