  - "1.  Abstract\n   The schema defined in this document is a minimal schema to support\n\
    \   PKIX in an LDAPv2 environment, as defined in RFC 2559.  Only PKIX-\n   specific\
    \ components are specified here.  LDAP servers, acting as PKIX\n   repositories\
    \ should support the auxiliary object classes defined in\n   this specification\
    \ and integrate this schema specification with the\n   generic and other application-specific\
    \ schemas as appropriate,\n   depending on the services to be supplied by that\
    \ server.\n   The key words 'MUST', 'SHALL', 'REQUIRED', 'SHOULD', 'RECOMMENDED',\n\
    \   and 'MAY' in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\n   2119.\n"
- title: 2.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "2.  Introduction\n   This specification is part of a multi-part standard for\
    \ development\n   of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for the Internet. LDAPv2\
    \ is one\n   mechanism defined for access to a PKI repository. Other mechanisms,\n\
    \   such as http, are also defined. If an LDAP server, accessed by LDAPv2\n  \
    \ is used to provide a repository, the minimum requirement is that the\n   repository\
    \ support the addition of X.509 certificates to directory\n   entries.  Certificate\
    \ Revocation List (CRL)is one mechanism for\n   publishing revocation information\
    \ in a repository.  Other mechanisms,\n   such as http, are also defined.\n  \
    \ This specification defines the attributes and object classes to be\n   used\
    \ by LDAP servers acting as PKIX repositories and to be understood\n   by LDAP\
    \ clients communicating with such repositories to query, add,\n   modify and delete\
    \ PKI information. Some object classes and attributes\n   defined in X.509 are\
    \ duplicated here for completeness. For end\n   entities and Certification Authorities\
    \ (CA), the earlier X.509\n   defined object classes mandated inclusion of attributes\
    \ which are\n   optional for PKIX. Also, because of the mandatory attribute\n\
    \   specification, this would have required dynamic modification of the\n   object\
    \ class attribute should the attributes not always be present in\n   entries.\
    \ For these reasons, alternative object classes are defined in\n   this document\
    \ for use by LDAP servers acting as PKIX repositories.\n"
- title: 3.  PKIX Repository Objects
  contents:
  - "3.  PKIX Repository Objects\n   The primary PKIX objects to be represented in\
    \ a repository are:\n      -  End Entities\n      -  Certification Authorities\
    \ (CA)\n   These objects are defined in RFC 2459.\n"
- title: 3.1.  End Entities
  contents:
  - "3.1.  End Entities\n   For purposes of PKIX schema definition, the role of end\
    \ entities as\n   subjects of certificates is the major aspect relevant to this\n\
    \   specification. End entities may be human users, or other types of\n   entities\
    \ to which certificates may be issued. In some cases, the\n   entry for the end\
    \ entity may already exist and the PKI-specific\n   information is added to the\
    \ existing entry. In other cases the entry\n   may not exist prior to the issuance\
    \ of a certificate, in which case\n   the entity adding the certificate may also\
    \ need to create the entry.\n   Schema elements used to represent the non PKIX\
    \ aspects of an entry,\n   such as the structural object class used to represent\
    \ organizational\n   persons, may vary, depending on the particular environment\
    \ and set of\n   applications served and are outside the scope of this specification.\n\
    \   The following auxiliary object class MAY be used to represent\n   certificate\
    \ subjects:\n"

    \ units etc. The non PKIX-specific schema elements for\n   these entries, such\
    \ as the structural object class of the object, are\n   outside the scope of this\
