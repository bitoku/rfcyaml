- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   IETF procedures, as defined by [RFC2026], allow for Informational\
    \ or\n   Experimental RFCs to be published without IETF rough consensus.  For\n\
    \   context, it should be remembered that this RFC predates the\n   separation\
    \ of the various streams (e.g., IRTF, IAB, and Independent.)\n   When it was written,\
    \ there were only \"RFCs\".\n   As a consequence, the IESG was permitted to approve\
    \ an Internet-Draft\n   for publication as an RFC without IETF rough consensus.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in BCP\n   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\n\
    \   capitals, as shown here.\n"
- title: 3.  Action
  contents:
  - "3.  Action\n   The IETF MUST NOT publish RFCs on the IETF Stream without\n  \
    \ establishing IETF rough consensus for publication.\n"
- title: 4.  Discussion
  contents:
  - "4.  Discussion\n   The IETF procedures prior to publication of this BCP permitted\
    \ such\n   informational or experimental publication without IETF rough\n   consensus.\
    \  In 2007, the IESG issued a statement saying that no\n   document will be issued\
    \ without first conducting an IETF Last Call\n   [IESG-STATE-AD].  While this\
    \ apparently improved the situation, when\n   looking more closely, it made it\
    \ worse.  Rather than publishing\n   documents without verifying that there is\
    \ rough consensus, as the\n   wording in [RFC2026] suggests, this had the IESG\
    \ explicitly\n   publishing documents on the IETF Stream that have failed to achieve\n\
    \   rough consensus.\n   One could argue that there is a need for publishing some\
    \ documents\n   that the community cannot agree on.  However, we have an explicit\n\
    \   path for such publication, namely the Independent Stream.  Or, for\n   research\
    \ documents, the IRTF Stream, which explicitly publishes\n   minority opinion\
    \ Informational RFCs.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   This document has no IANA actions.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This document introduces no new security considerations.\
    \  It is a\n   process document about changes to the rules for certain corner\
    \ cases\n   in publishing IETF Stream RFCs.  However, this procedure will prevent\n\
    \   publication of IETF Stream documents that have not reached rough\n   consensus\
    \ about their security aspects, thus potentially improving\n   security aspects\
    \ of IETF Stream documents.\n"
