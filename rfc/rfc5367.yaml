- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies a way to create subscription to a list of\n\
    \   resources in SIP.  This is achieved by including the list of\n   resources\
    \ in the body of a SUBSCRIBE request.  Instead of having a\n   subscriber send\
    \ a SUBSCRIBE request for each resource individually,\n   the subscriber defines\
    \ the resource list, subscribes to it, and gets\n   notifications about changes\
    \ in the resources' states using a single\n   SUBSCRIBE dialog.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC4662] specifies how to establish subscriptions to a\
    \ homogeneous\n   resource list in SIP (which is specified in [RFC3261]) and defines\n\
    \   the procedures for getting notifications about changes in the state\n   of\
    \ the associated resources.  Yet, list creation is outside the scope\n   of [RFC4662].\n\
    \   This document specifies a way to create a list with a set of\n   resources\
    \ and subscribe to it using a single SIP request.  This is\n   achieved by including\
    \ the list of resources (as defined in [RFC5363])\n   in the body of the SUBSCRIBE\
    \ request.\n"

    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\

    \ 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  User Agent Client Procedures
  contents:
  - "3.  User Agent Client Procedures\n   A UAC (User Agent Client) that wants to\
    \ create a resource list and\n   subscribe to it using the mechanism described\
    \ in this document\n   constructs a SUBSCRIBE request with at least one body,\
    \ whose\n   disposition is type \"recipient-list\" as defined in [RFC5363], that\n\
    \   contains the URI list.  Additionally, the UAC MUST include the\n   'recipient-list-subscribe'\
    \ option-tag (which is registered with the\n   IANA in Section 9) in a Require\
    \ header field.  The UAC MUST build the\n   rest of the SUBSCRIBE request following\
    \ the rules in [RFC3265].\n   The UAC MUST support the \"rlmi+xml\" format defined\
    \ in [RFC4662] and\n   signal this by including \"rlmi+xml\" in the Accept header.\
    \  The UAC\n   MAY support additional formats and include them in the Accept header\n\
    \   field of the SUBSCRIBE request.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Response Handling
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Response Handling\n   The status code in the response to the SUBSCRIBE\
    \ request does not\n   provide any information about whether or not the resource\
    \ list server\n   was able to successfully subscribe to the URIs in the URI list.\
    \  The\n   UAC obtains this information in the notifications sent by the server.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Subsequent SUBSCRIBE Requests
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Subsequent SUBSCRIBE Requests\n   The previous sections have specified\
    \ how to include a URI list in an\n   initial SUBSCRIBE request to a resource\
    \ list server in order to\n   subscribe to the state of a set of resources.  Once\
    \ the subscription\n   has been created and a dialog between the UAC and the resource\
    \ list\n   server has been established, the UAC can send subsequent SUBSCRIBE\n\
    \   requests to, for example, extend the duration of the subscription.\n   At\
    \ this point, there are no semantics associated with resource-list\n   bodies\
    \ in subsequent SUBSCRIBE requests (although future extensions\n   can define\
    \ them).  Therefore, UACs SHOULD NOT include resource-list\n   bodies in subsequent\
    \ SUBSCRIBE requests to a resource list server.\n      Note that a difference\
    \ between an initial SUBSCRIBE request and\n      subsequent ones is that while\
    \ the initial request is sent to the\n      public URI of the resource list, subsequent\
    \ ones are sent to the\n      URI provided by the server when the dialog is established.\n\
    \      Therefore, from the UAC's point of view, the resource identified\n    \
    \  by the former URI supports recipient-list bodies, while the\n      resource\
    \ identified by the latter does not support them.\n"
- title: 4.  URI-List Document Format
  contents:
  - "4.  URI-List Document Format\n   [RFC5363] mandates that each URI-list services\
    \ specification, such as\n   the subscription service defined here, specifies\
    \ the default format\n   for the recipient-list bodies used within the particular\
    \ service.\n   The default format for the recipient-list bodies for the subscription\n\
    \   service defined in this document is the resource list format defined\n   in\
    \ [RFC4826].  UAs (User Agents) generating recipient-list bodies\n   MUST support\
    \ this format and MAY support other formats.  Resource\n   list servers able to\
    \ handle recipient-list bodies MUST support this\n   format and MAY support other\
    \ formats.\n   The Extensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol\n\
    \   (XCAP) resource list document provides features, such as hierarchical\n  \
    \ lists and the ability to include entries by reference relative to the\n   XCAP\
    \ root URI, that are not needed by the subscription service\n   defined here,\
    \ which only needs to transfer a flat list of URIs\n   between a UA and the resource\
    \ list server.  Therefore, when using the\n   default resource list document,\
    \ UAs SHOULD use flat lists (i.e., no\n   hierarchical lists) and SHOULD NOT use\
    \ <entry-ref> elements.  A\n   resource list server receiving a URI list with\
    \ more information than\n   what has just been described MAY discard all the extra\
    \ information.\n   Figure 1 shows an example of a flat list that follows the resource\n\
    \   list document.\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n   <resource-lists\
    \ xmlns=\"urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:resource-lists\"\n                  xmlns:xsi=\"\
    http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">\n     <list>\n       <entry uri=\"\

    \   <entry uri=\"sip:ted@example.net\" />\n     </list>\n   </resource-lists>\n\

- title: 5.  Resource List Server Behavior
  contents:
  - "5.  Resource List Server Behavior\n   Resource list servers that are able to\
    \ receive and process SUBSCRIBE\n   requests with a recipient-list body SHOULD\
    \ include a 'recipient-list-\n   subscribe' option-tag in a Supported header field\
    \ when responding to\n   OPTIONS requests.\n   On reception of a SUBSCRIBE request\
    \ with a URI list, a resource list\n   server that chooses to accept the \"rlmi+xml\"\
    \ format MUST comply with\n   [RFC4662] for creating the subscription and reporting\
    \ the changes in\n   the resources within the created dialog.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Subsequent SUBSCRIBE Requests
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Subsequent SUBSCRIBE Requests\n   At this point, there are no semantics\
    \ associated with resource-list\n   bodies in subsequent SUBSCRIBE requests (although\
    \ future extensions\n   may define them).  Therefore, a resource list server receiving\
    \ a\n   subsequent SUBSCRIBE request with a resource-list body, following\n  \
    \ standard SIP procedures, rejects it with a 415 (Unsupported Media\n   Type)\
    \ response.\n"
- title: 6.  Providing a URI to Manipulate a Resource List
  contents:
  - "6.  Providing a URI to Manipulate a Resource List\n   A UAC can manipulate a\
    \ resource list at a resource list server.  The\n   resource list server MAY provide\
    \ a URI to manipulate the resource\n   list associated with a subscription using\
    \ the Call-Info header field\n   in the NOTIFY request that establishes the subscription.\
    \  The\n   \"purpose\" parameter of the Call-Info header field MUST have a value\n\
    \   of 'list-management', which we register with the IANA in Section 9.\n   The\
    \ following is an example of such a header field.\n   Call-Info: <http://xcap.example.com/your-list.xml>\n\
    \              ;purpose=list-management\n   The lifetime of a resource list to\
    \ be manipulated by the URI provided\n   by the server is bundled to the lifetime\
    \ of the subscription.  That\n   is, the resource list SHOULD be destroyed when\
    \ the subscription\n   expires or is otherwise terminated.\n   Section 7.1 of\
    \ [RFC3265] does not list the Call-Info header field in\n   the table of header\
    \ fields that NOTIFY requests can carry.  This\n   document updates that table\
    \ so that the Call-Info header field can be\n   optionally included in NOTIFY\
    \ requests.\n"

    \   implementations of resource list servers that handle request-\n   contained\
