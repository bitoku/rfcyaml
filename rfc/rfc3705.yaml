    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n

  title: 1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

  - "2.  Overview\n   In cases where a manager must obtain performance history data
    about\n   the behavior of equipment it manages, several strategies can be\n   followed
    in the design of a MIB module that represents the managed\n   equipment, including:\n
    \  -  The agent counts events on a continuous basis and, whenever\n      desired,
    the manager obtains the value of the event counter and\n      adjusts its understanding
    of the history of events at the agent.\n   -  The agent allocates events to 'buckets'
    where each bucket\n      represents an interval of time.\n   Telecommunications
    equipment often makes use of the latter strategy.\n   For such equipment the standard
    practice is that history data is\n   maintained by the agent in terms of 15-minute
    intervals [T1.231].\n   MIB modules for collecting performance history based on
    15-minute\n   intervals have been defined for the DS1/E1 [RFC2495], DS3/E3\n   [RFC2496],
    SONET/SDH [RFC3592], ADSL [RFC2662], HDLS2 and SHDSL\n   [RFC3276] interface types.
    \ These MIB modules use a common set of\n   textual conventions defined in [RFC3593].\n
    \  A need has arisen to define 64-bit versions of the textual\n   conventions
    in [RFC3593].  Ideally, these high-capacity textual\n   conventions would be based
    on a Gauge64 or Unsigned64 data type, but\n   unfortunately no such types exist
    in SMIv2.  The next best choice\n   would be to base them on the CounterBasedGauge64
    textual convention\n   presented in [RFC2856], but that is not possible either
    since SMIv2\n   allows only base types to be used in defining textual conventions.\n
    \  Therefore, the textual conventions presented in this memo are based\n   directly
    on the Counter64 type, like those in [RFC2856].  They are\n   subject to the following
    limitations:\n   -  The MAX-ACCESS of objects defined using these textual conventions\n
    \     must be read-only, because the MAX-ACCESS of the underlying\n      Counter64
    type is read-only.\n   -  No sub-range can be specified in object definitions
    using these\n      textual conventions, because sub-ranges are not allowed on\n
    \     Counter64 objects.\n   -  No DEFVAL clause can be specified in object definitions
    using\n      these textual conventions, because DEFVALs are not allowed on\n      Counter64
    objects.\n   -  Objects defined using these textual conventions cannot be used
    in\n      an INDEX clause, because there is no INDEX clause mapping defined\n
    \     for objects of type Counter64.\n   Use of the textual conventions presented
    in this memo assumes the\n   following:\n   -  The agent supports 15 minute based
    history counters.\n   -  The agent is capable of keeping a history of 96 intervals
    of 15\n      minute performance data.\n   -  The agent may optionally support
    performance data aggregating the\n      history intervals.\n   -  The agent will
    keep separate tables for the current interval, the\n      history intervals, and
    the total aggregates.\n"

    \ Instead, it\n   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other
    MIB\n   modules to define management objects.\n   Meaningful security considerations
    can only be written in the MIB\n   modules that define management objects.  This
    document has therefore\n   no impact on the security of the Internet.\n"
