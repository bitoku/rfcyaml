  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes requirements for user and data plane\n\
    \   Operations and Management (OAM) for Multi-Protocol Label Switching\n   (MPLS).\
    \  These requirements have been gathered from network operators\n   who have extensive\
    \ experience deploying MPLS networks.  This document\n   specifies OAM requirements\
    \ for MPLS, as well as for applications of\n   MPLS.\n   Currently, there are\
    \ no specific mechanisms proposed to address these\n   requirements.  The goal\
    \ of this document is to identify a commonly\n   applicable set of requirements\
    \ for MPLS OAM at this time.\n   Specifically, a set of requirements that apply\
    \ to the most common set\n   of MPLS networks deployed by service provider organizations\
    \ at the\n   time this document was written.  These requirements can then be used\n\
    \   as a base for network management tool development and to guide the\n   evolution\
    \ of currently specified tools, as well as the specification\n   of OAM functions\

- title: 4.1.  Detection of Label Switched Path Defects
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Detection of Label Switched Path Defects\n   The ability to detect defects\
    \ in a broken LSP MUST not require manual\n   hop-by-hop troubleshooting of each\
    \ LSR used to switch traffic for\n   that LSP.  For example, it is not desirable\
    \ to manually visit each\n   LSR along the data plane path transited by an LSP;\
    \ instead, this\n   function MUST be automated and able to be performed at some\
    \ operator\n   specified frequency from the origination point of that LSP.  This\n\
    \   implies solutions that are interoperable to allow for such automatic\n   operation.\n\
    \   Furthermore, the automation of path liveliness is desired in cases\n   where\
    \ large numbers of LSPs might be tested.  For example, automated\n   ingress LSR\
    \ to egress LSR testing functionality is desired for some\n   LSPs.  The goal\
    \ is to detect LSP path defects before customers do,\n   which requires detection\
    \ and correction of LSP defects in a manner\n   that is both predictable and within\
    \ the constraints of the service\n   level agreement under which the service is\
    \ being offered.  Simply\n   put, the sum of the time it takes an OAM tool to\
    \ detect a defect and\n   the time needed for an operational support system to\
    \ react to this\n   defect, by possibly correcting it or notifying the customer,\
    \ must\n   fall within the bounds of the service level agreement in question.\n\
    \   Synchronization of detection time bounds by tools used to detect\n   broken\
    \ LSPs is required.  Failure to specify defect detection time\n   bounds may result\
    \ in an ambiguity in test results.  If the time to\n   detect broken LSPs is known,\
    \ then automated responses can be\n   specified with respect and regard to resiliency\
    \ and service level\n   specification reporting.  Further, if synchronization\
    \ of detection\n   time bounds is possible, an operational framework can be established\n\
    \   to guide the design and specification of MPLS applications.\n   Although an\
    \ ICMP-based ping [RFC792] can be sent through an LSP as an\n   IP payload, the\
    \ use of this tool to verify the defect-free operation\n   of an LSP has the potential\
    \ of returning erroneous results (both\n   positive and negative) for a number\
    \ of reasons.  For example, in some\n   cases, because the ICMP traffic is based\
    \ on legally addressable IP\n   addressing, it is possible for ICMP messages that\
    \ are originally\n   transmitted inside of an LSP to \"fall out of the LSP\" at\
    \ some point\n   along the path.  In these cases, since ICMP packets are routable,\
    \ a\n   falsely positive response may be returned.  In other cases, where the\n\
    \   data plane of a specific LSP needs to be tested, it is difficult to\n   guarantee\
    \ that traffic based on an ICMP ping header is parsed and\n   hashed to the same\
    \ equal-cost multi-paths (ECMP) as the data traffic.\n   Any detection mechanisms\
    \ that depend on receiving the status via a\n   return path SHOULD provide multiple\
    \ return options with the\n   expectation that one of them will not be impacted\
    \ by the original\n   defect.  An example of a case where a false negative might\
    \ occur\n   would be a mechanism that requires a functional MPLS return path.\n\
    \   Since MPLS LSPs are unidirectional, it is possible that although the\n   forward\
    \ LSP, which is the LSP under test, might be functioning, the\n   response from\
    \ the destination LSR might be lost, thus giving the\n   source LSR the false\
    \ impression that the forward LSP is defective.\n   However, if an alternate return\
    \ path could be specified -- say IP for\n   example -- then the source could specify\
    \ this as the return path to\n   the destination, and in this case, would receive\
    \ a response\n   indicating that the return LSP is defective.\n   The OAM packet\
    \ MUST follow the customer data path exactly in order to\n   reflect path liveliness\
    \ used by customer data.  Particular cases of\n   interest are forwarding mechanisms,\
    \ such as ECMP scenarios within the\n   operator's network, whereby flows are\
    \ load-shared across parallel\n   paths (i.e., equal IGP cost).  Where the customer\
    \ traffic may be\n   spread over multiple paths, the ability to detect failures\
    \ on any of\n   the path permutations is required.  Where the spreading mechanism\
    \ is\n   payload specific, payloads need to have forwarding that is common\n \
    \  with the traffic under test.  Satisfying these requirements\n   introduces\
    \ complexity into ensuring that ECMP connectivity\n   permutations are exercised\
    \ and that defect detection occurs in a\n   reasonable amount of time.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.  Diagnosis of a Broken Label Switched Path\n   The ability to diagnose a\
    \ broken LSP and to isolate the failed\n   component (i.e., link or node) in the\
    \ path is required.  For example,\n   note that specifying recovery actions for\
    \ mis-branching defects in an\n   LDP network is a particularly difficult case.\
    \  Diagnosis of defects\n   and isolation of the failed component is best accomplished\
    \ via a path\n   trace function that can return the entire list of LSRs and links\
    \ used\n   by a certain LSP (or at least the set of LSRs/links up to the\n   location\
    \ of the defect).  The tracing capability SHOULD include the\n   ability to trace\
    \ recursive paths, such as when nested LSPs are used.\n   This path trace function\
    \ MUST also be capable of diagnosing LSP mis-\n   merging by permitting comparison\
    \ of expected vs. actual forwarding\n   behavior at any LSR in the path.  The\
    \ path trace capability SHOULD be\n   capable of being executed from the head-end\
    \ Label Switching Router\n   (LSR) and may permit downstream path components to\
    \ be traced from an\n   intermediate mid-point LSR.  Additionally, the path trace\
    \ function\n   MUST have the ability to support ECMP scenarios described in Section\n\
    \   4.1.\n"

    \   includes but is not limited to:\n      -  consistent use of pipe or uniform\
    \ time to live (TTL) models by\n         an LSR [RFC3443].\n      -  sufficient\

    \  In addition, the ability to measure the quantitative\n   aspects of LSPs, such\

  contents:
  - "4.5.  Frequency of OAM Execution\n   The operator MUST have the flexibility to\
    \ configure OAM parameters to\n   meet their specific operational requirements.\n\
    \   This includes the frequency of the execution of any OAM functions.\n   The\
    \ ability to synchronize OAM operations is required to permit a\n   consistent\
    \ measurement of service level agreements.  To elaborate,\n   there are defect\
    \ conditions, such as mis-branching or misdirection of\n   traffic, for which\
    \ probe-based detection mechanisms that incur\n   significant mismatches in their\
    \ detection frequency may result in\n   flapping.  This can be addressed either\
    \ by synchronizing the rate or\n   having the probes self-identify their probe\
    \ rate.  For example, when\n   the probing mechanisms are bootstrapping, they\
    \ might negotiate and\n   ultimately agree on a probing rate, therefore providing\
    \ a consistent\n   probing frequency and avoiding the aforementioned problems.\n\
    \   One observation would be that wide-spread deployment of MPLS, common\n   implementation\
    \ of monitoring tools, and the need for inter-carrier\n   synchronization of defect\
    \ and service level specification handling\n   will drive specification of OAM\
    \ parameters to commonly agreed on\n   values.  Such values will have to be harmonized\
    \ with the surrounding\n   technologies (e.g., SONET/SDH, ATM) to be useful. \
    \ This will become\n   particularly important as networks scale and mis-configuration\
    \ can\n   result in churn, alarm flapping, etc.\n"
- title: 4.6.  Alarm Suppression, Aggregation, and Layer Coordination
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Alarm Suppression, Aggregation, and Layer Coordination\n   Network elements\
    \ MUST provide alarm suppression functionality that\n   prevents the generation\
    \ of a superfluous generation of alarms by\n   simply discarding them (or not\
    \ generating them in the first place),\n   or by aggregating them together, thereby\
    \ greatly reducing the number\n   of notifications emitted.  When viewed in conjunction\
    \ with the\n   requirement in Section 4.7 below, this typically requires fault\n\
    \   notification to the LSP egress that may have specific time\n   constraints\
    \ if the application using the LSP independently implements\n   path continuity\
    \ testing (for example, ATM I.610 Continuity check\n   (CC)[I610]).  These constraints\
    \ apply to LSPs that are monitored.\n   The nature of MPLS applications allows\
    \ for the possibility of having\n   multiple MPLS applications attempt to respond\
    \ to defects\n   simultaneously, e.g., layer-3 MPLS VPNs that utilize Traffic\n\
    \   Engineered tunnels where a failure occurs on the LSP carrying the\n   Traffic\

  contents:
  - "4.7.  Support for OAM Inter-working for Fault Notification\n   An LSR supporting\
    \ the inter-working of one or more networking\n   technologies over MPLS MUST\

    \  For example, errors\n   occurring over an MPLS transport LSP that supports\

    \ Signal\n   (AIS) cells at the termination points of the LSP.  The mechanism\n\
    \   SHOULD consider possible bounded detection time parameters, e.g., a\n   \"\
    hold off\" function before reacting to synchronize with the OAM\n   functions.\n\
    \   One goal would be alarm suppression by the upper layer using the LSP.\n  \
    \ As observed in Section 4.5, this requires that MPLS perform detection\n   in\

    \ how much traffic\n   is traveling from location to location (i.e., a traffic\
    \ matrix) by\n   analyzing the flow of traffic.  Therefore, traffic accounting\
    \ in an\n   MPLS network can be summarized as the following three items:\n   \
    \   (1) Collecting information to design network\n          For the purpose of\
    \ optimized network design, a service\n          provider may offer the traffic\
    \ information.  Optimizing\n          network design needs this information.\n\
    \      (2) Providing a Service Level Specification\n          Providers and their\
    \ customers MAY need to verify high-level\n          service level specifications,\
    \ either to continuously optimize\n          their networks, or to offer guaranteed\
    \ bandwidth services.\n          Therefore, traffic accounting to monitor MPLS\
    \ applications is\n          required.\n      (3) Inter-AS environment\n     \
    \     Service providers that offer inter-AS services require\n          accounting\
    \ of those services.\n      These three motivations need to satisfy the following:\n\
    \          -  In (1) and (2), collection of information on a per-LSP\n       \
    \      basis is a minimum level of granularity for collecting\n             accounting\
    \ information at both of ingress and egress of an\n             LSP.\n       \
    \   -  In (3), SP's ASBR carry out interconnection functions as an\n         \
    \    intermediate LSR.  Therefore, identifying a pair of ingress\n           \
    \  and egress LSRs using each LSP is needed to determine the\n             cost\
    \ of the service that a customer is using.\n"
- title: 4.11.1.  Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.11.1.  Requirements\n   Accounting on a per-LSP basis encompasses the following\
    \ set of\n   functions:\n      (1) At an ingress LSR, accounting of traffic through\
    \ LSPs that\n          begin at each egress in question.\n      (2) At an intermediate\
    \ LSR, accounting of traffic through LSPs for\n          each pair of ingress\
    \ to egress.\n      (3) At egress LSR, accounting of traffic through LSPs for\
    \ each\n          ingress.\n      (4) All LSRs containing LSPs that are being\
    \ measured need to have\n          a common identifier to distinguish each LSP.\
    \  The identifier\n          MUST be unique to each LSP, and its mapping to LSP\
    \ SHOULD be\n          provided whether from manual or automatic configuration.\n\
    \      In the case of non-merged LSPs, this can be achieved by simply\n      reading\
    \ traffic counters for the label stack associated with the\n      LSP at any LSR\
    \ along its path.  However, in order to measure\n      merged LSPs, an LSR MUST\
    \ have a means to distinguish the source of\n      each flow so as to disambiguate\
    \ the statistics.\n"
- title: 4.11.2.  Location of Accounting
  contents:
  - "4.11.2.  Location of Accounting\n   It is not realistic for LSRs to perform the\
    \ described operations on\n   all LSPs that exist in a network.  At a minimum,\
    \ per-LSP based\n   accounting SHOULD be performed on the edges of the network\
    \ -- at the\n   edges of both LSPs and the MPLS domain.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Provisions to any of the network mechanisms designed\
    \ to satisfy the\n   requirements described herein are required to prevent their\n\
    \   unauthorized use.  Likewise, these network mechanisms MUST provide a\n   means\
    \ by which an operator can prevent denial of service attacks if\n   those network\
    \ mechanisms are used in such an attack.\n   LSP mis-merging has security implications\
    \ beyond that of simply being\n   a network defect.  LSP mis-merging can happen\
    \ due to a number of\n   potential sources of failure, some of which (due to MPLS\
    \ label\n   stacking) are new to MPLS.\n   The performance of diagnostic functions\
    \ and path characterization\n   involve extracting a significant amount of information\
    \ about network\n   construction that the network operator MAY consider private.\n"
