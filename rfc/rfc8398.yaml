  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC5280] defines the rfc822Name subjectAltName name type\
    \ for\n   representing email addresses as described in [RFC5321].  The syntax\n\
    \   of rfc822Name is restricted to a subset of US-ASCII characters and\n   thus\
    \ can't be used to represent internationalized email addresses\n   [RFC6531].\
    \  This document defines a new otherName variant to\n   represent internationalized\
    \ email addresses.  In addition this\n   document requires all email address domains\
    \ in X.509 certificates to\n   conform to IDNA2008 [RFC5890].\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Name Definitions\n   The GeneralName structure is defined in [RFC5280] and\
    \ supports many\n   different name forms including otherName for extensibility.\
    \  This\n   section specifies the SmtpUTF8Mailbox name form of otherName so that\n\
    \   internationalized email addresses can appear in the subjectAltName of\n  \
    \ a certificate, the issuerAltName of a certificate, or anywhere else\n   that\
    \ GeneralName is used.\n   id-on-SmtpUTF8Mailbox OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-on\
    \ 9 }\n   SmtpUTF8Mailbox ::= UTF8String (SIZE (1..MAX))\n   -- SmtpUTF8Mailbox\
    \ conforms to Mailbox as specified\n   -- in Section 3.3 of RFC 6531.\n   When\
    \ the subjectAltName (or issuerAltName) extension contains an\n   internationalized\
    \ email address with a non-ASCII local-part, the\n   address MUST be stored in\
    \ the SmtpUTF8Mailbox name form of otherName.\n   The format of SmtpUTF8Mailbox\
    \ is defined as the ABNF rule\n   SmtpUTF8Mailbox.  SmtpUTF8Mailbox is a modified\
    \ version of the\n   internationalized Mailbox that was defined in Section 3.3\
    \ of\n   [RFC6531], which was derived from Mailbox as defined in Section 4.1.2\n\
    \   of [RFC5321].  [RFC6531] defines the following ABNF rules for Mailbox\n  \
    \ whose parts are modified for internationalization: <Local-part>,\n   <Dot-string>,\
    \ <Quoted-string>, <QcontentSMTP>, <Domain>, and <Atom>.\n   In particular, <Local-part>\
    \ was updated to also support UTF8-non-\n   ascii.  UTF8-non-ascii was described\
    \ by Section 3.1 of [RFC6532].\n   Also, domain was extended to support U-labels,\
    \ as defined in\n   [RFC5890].\n   This document further refines internationalized\
    \ Mailbox ABNF rules as\n   described in [RFC6531] and calls this SmtpUTF8Mailbox.\
    \  In\n   SmtpUTF8Mailbox, labels that include non-ASCII characters MUST be\n\
    \   stored in U-label (rather than A-label) form [RFC5890].  This\n   restriction\
    \ removes the need to determine which label encoding, A- or\n   U-label, is present\
    \ in the domain.  As per Section 2.3.2.1 of\n   [RFC5890], U-labels are encoded\
    \ as UTF-8 [RFC3629] in Normalization\n   Form C and other properties specified\
    \ there.  In SmtpUTF8Mailbox,\n   domain labels that solely use ASCII characters\
    \ (meaning neither A-\n   nor U-labels) SHALL use NR-LDH restrictions as specified\
    \ by\n   Section 2.3.1 of [RFC5890] and SHALL be restricted to lowercase\n   letters.\
    \  NR-LDH stands for \"Non-Reserved Letters Digits Hyphen\" and\n   is the set\
    \ of LDH labels that do not have \"--\" characters in the\n   third and forth\
    \ character position, which excludes \"tagged domain\n   names\" such as A-labels.\
    \  Consistent with the treatment of rfc822Name\n   in [RFC5280], SmtpUTF8Mailbox\
    \ is an envelope <Mailbox> and has no\n   phrase (such as a common name) before\
    \ it, has no comment (text\n   surrounded in parentheses) after it, and is not\
    \ surrounded by \"<\" and\n   \">\" characters.\n   Due to name constraint compatibility\
    \ reasons described in Section 6,\n   SmtpUTF8Mailbox subjectAltName MUST NOT\
    \ be used unless the local-part\n   of the email address contains non-ASCII characters.\
    \  When the local-\n   part is ASCII, rfc822Name subjectAltName MUST be used instead\
    \ of\n   SmtpUTF8Mailbox.  This is compatible with legacy software that\n   supports\
    \ only rfc822Name (and not SmtpUTF8Mailbox).  The appropriate\n   usage of rfc822Name\
    \ and SmtpUTF8Mailbox is summarized in Table 1\n   below.\n   SmtpUTF8Mailbox\
    \ is encoded as UTF8String.  The UTF8String encoding\n   MUST NOT contain a Byte-Order-Mark\
    \ (BOM) [RFC3629] to aid consistency\n   across implementations, particularly\
    \ for comparison.\n    +-----------------+-------------+--------------+-----------------+\n\

- title: 5.  Matching of Internationalized Email Addresses in X.509 Certificates
  contents:
  - "5.  Matching of Internationalized Email Addresses in X.509 Certificates\n   In\
    \ equivalence comparison with SmtpUTF8Mailbox, there may be some\n   setup work\
    \ on one or both inputs depending on whether the input is\n   already in comparison\
    \ form.  Comparing SmtpUTF8Mailboxes consists of\n   a domain part step and a\
    \ local-part step.  The comparison form for\n   local-parts is always UTF-8. \
    \ The comparison form for domain parts\n   depends on context.  While some contexts\
    \ such as certificate path\n   validation in [RFC5280] specify transforming domain\
    \ to A-label\n   (Sections 7.2 and 7.5 in [RFC5280] as updated by [RFC8399]),\
    \ this\n   document recommends transforming to UTF-8 U-label instead.  This\n\
    \   reduces the likelihood of errors by reducing conversions as more\n   implementations\
    \ natively support U-label domains.\n   Comparison of two SmtpUTF8Mailboxes is\
    \ straightforward with no setup\n   work needed.  They are considered equivalent\
    \ if there is an exact\n   octet-for-octet match.  Comparison with email addresses\
    \ such as\n   internationalized email address or rfc822Name requires additional\n\
    \   setup steps for domain part and local-part.  The initial preparation\n   for\
    \ the email addresses is to remove any phrases, comments, and \"<\"\n   or \"\
    >\" characters.  This document calls for comparison of domain\n   labels that\
    \ include non-ASCII characters to be transformed to\n   U-labels if not already\
    \ in that form.  The first step is to detect\n   use of the A-label by using Section\
    \ 5.1 of [RFC5891].  Next, if\n   necessary, transform any A-labels (US-ASCII)\
    \ to U-labels (Unicode) as\n   specified in Section 5.2 of [RFC5891].  Finally,\
    \ if necessary,\n   convert the Unicode to UTF-8 as specified in Section 3 of\
    \ [RFC3629].\n   For ASCII NR-LDH labels, uppercase letters are converted to lowercase\n\
    \   letters.  In setup for SmtpUTF8Mailbox, the email address local-part\n   MUST\
    \ conform to the requirements of [RFC6530] and [RFC6531],\n   including being\
    \ a string in UTF-8 form.  In particular, the local-\n   part MUST NOT be transformed\
    \ in any way, such as by doing case\n   folding or normalization of any kind.\
    \  The <Local-part> part of an\n   internationalized email address is already\
    \ in UTF-8.  For rfc822Name,\n   the local-part, which is IA5String (ASCII), trivially\
    \ maps to UTF-8\n   without change.  Once setup is complete, they are again compared\n\
    \   octet for octet.\n   To summarize non-normatively, the comparison steps, including\
    \ setup,\n   are:\n   1.  If the domain contains A-labels, transform them to U-labels.\n\
    \   2.  If the domain contains ASCII NR-LDH labels, lowercase them.\n   3.  Compare\
    \ strings octet for octet for equivalence.\n   This specification expressly does\
    \ not define any wildcard characters,\n   and SmtpUTF8Mailbox comparison implementations\
    \ MUST NOT interpret any\n   characters as wildcards.  Instead, to specify multiple\
    \ email\n   addresses through SmtpUTF8Mailbox, the certificate MUST use multiple\n\
    \   subjectAltNames or issuerAltNames to explicitly carry any additional\n   email\
    \ addresses.\n"
- title: 6.  Name Constraints in Path Validation
  contents:
  - "6.  Name Constraints in Path Validation\n   This section updates Section 4.2.1.10\
    \ of [RFC5280] to extend\n   rfc822Name name constraints to SmtpUTF8Mailbox subjectAltNames.\n\
    \   SmtpUTF8Mailbox-aware path validators will apply name constraint\n   comparison\
    \ to the subject distinguished name and both forms of\n   subject alternative\
    \ names rfc822Name and SmtpUTF8Mailbox.\n   Both rfc822Name and SmtpUTF8Mailbox\
    \ subject alternative names\n   represent the same underlying email address namespace.\
    \  Since legacy\n   CAs constrained to issue certificates for a specific set of\
    \ domains\n   would lack corresponding UTF-8 constraints, [RFC8399] updates,\n\
    \   modifies, and extends rfc822Name name constraints defined in\n   [RFC5280]\
    \ to cover SmtpUTF8Mailbox subject alternative names.  This\n   ensures that the\
    \ introduction of SmtpUTF8Mailbox does not violate\n   existing name constraints.\
    \  Since it is not valid to include\n   non-ASCII UTF-8 characters in the local-part\
    \ of rfc822Name name\n   constraints, and since name constraints that include\
    \ a local-part are\n   rarely, if at all, used in practice, name constraints updated\
    \ in\n   [RFC8399] allow the forms that represent all addresses at a host or\n\
    \   all mailboxes in a domain and deprecates rfc822Name name constraints\n   that\
    \ represent a particular mailbox.  That is, rfc822Name constraints\n   with a\
    \ local-part SHOULD NOT be used.\n   Constraint comparison with SmtpUTF8Mailbox\
    \ subjectAltName starts with\n   the setup steps defined by Section 5.  Setup\
    \ converts the inputs of\n   the comparison (which is one of a subject distinguished\
    \ name, an\n   rfc822Name, or an SmtpUTF8Mailbox subjectAltName, and one of an\n\
    \   rfc822Name name constraint) to constraint comparison form.  For an\n   rfc822Name\
    \ name constraint, this will convert any domain A-labels to\n   U-labels.  For\
    \ both the name constraint and the subject, this will\n   lowercase any domain\
    \ NR-LDH labels.  Strip the local-part and \"@\"\n   separator from each rfc822Name\
    \ and SmtpUTF8Mailbox, leaving just the\n   domain part.  After setup, this follows\
    \ the comparison steps defined\n   in Section 4.2.1.10 of [RFC5280] as follows.\
    \  If the resulting name\n   constraint domain starts with a \".\" character,\
    \ then for the name\n   constraint to match, a suffix of the resulting subject\
    \ alternative\n   name domain MUST match the name constraint (including the leading\n\
    \   \".\") octet for octet.  If the resulting name constraint domain does\n  \
    \ not start with a \".\" character, then for the name constraint to\n   match,\
    \ the entire resulting subject alternative name domain MUST\n   match the name\
    \ constraint octet for octet.\n   Certificate Authorities that wish to issue CA\
    \ certificates with email\n   address name constraints MUST use rfc822Name subject\
    \ alternative\n   names only.  These MUST be IDNA2008-conformant names with no\
    \ mappings\n   and with non-ASCII domains encoded in A-labels only.\n   The name\
    \ constraint requirement with SmtpUTF8Mailbox subject\n   alternative name is\
    \ illustrated in the non-normative diagram in\n   Figure 1.  The first example\
    \ (1) illustrates a permitted rfc822Name\n   ASCII-only host name name constraint\
    \ and the corresponding valid\n   rfc822Name subjectAltName and SmtpUTF8Mailbox\
    \ subjectAltName email\n   addresses.  The second example (2) illustrates a permitted\
    \ rfc822Name\n   host name name constraint with A-label, and the corresponding\
    \ valid\n   rfc822Name subjectAltName and SmtpUTF8Mailbox subjectAltName email\n\
    \   addresses.  Note that an email address with ASCII-only local-part is\n   encoded\
    \ as rfc822Name despite also having Unicode present in the\n   domain.\n   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\
