  - "                 SCENARIOS FOR USING ARPANET COMPUTERS\n   This scenario booklet\
    \ is provided to facilitate the use of ARPANET\n   host computer systems via the\
    \ ARPANET.  The objective of these\n   scenarios is to aid a user in sampling\
    \ host computers on the ARPANET,\n   thereby stimulating this interest in using\
    \ ARPANET.\n   The scenarios describe the login procedure, the use of some simple\
    \ or\n   interesting facilities, and obtaining on-line help facilities such as\n\
    \   on-line documentation and interactive dialog with experienced users\n   via\
    \ \"link\" or \"message\" type mechanisms.  The use of TELNETS for\n   \"piggy-back\
    \ login\" is included to help system programmers in\n   debugging and testing\
    \ their protocol implementations.  An exercise of\n   editing and running a very\
    \ simple program is also included, where\n   appropriate.\n   The scenarios assume\
    \ the environment of the MIT-DMCG PDP-10 computer\n   system, but are readily\
    \ adaptable to use from other systems.  The\n   annotated script is provided to\
    \ assist you in the use of a particular\n   host computer.  Comments are enclosed\
    \ in parenthesis, and user input\n   is underlined.  In the scripts, a carriage\
    \ return is indicated by\n   '<CR>', and a space by blank (i.e., no type).  Escape\
    \ to local user\n   TELNET is indicated by backslash, the default escape character\
    \ in the\n   MIT_DMCG system.  Additional blank lines have been introduced in\
    \ many\n   instances to improve readability of the script.\n   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:\
    \  The author wishes to acknowledge the help of Bob\n   Bressler, Rich Guida,\
    \ Bob Metcalfe, Jim Michener, and Neal Ryan in\n   preparing this Scenarios booklet.\n\
