    \ as described in \n   the NAOL and NAOP Telnet options.\n      IAC DO NAOHTS\
    \ \n         The data sender requests or agrees to negotiate about output \n \
    \        horizontal tabstops with the data receiver.  In the case where \n   \
    \      agreement has been reached and in the absence of further \n         subnegotiations,\
    \ the data receiver is assumed to be handling output \n         horizontal tabstops.\n\
    \      IAC DON'T NAOHTS \n         The data sender refuses to negotiate about\
    \ output horizontal tabstops \n         with the data receiver, or demands a return\
    \ to the unnegotiated \n         default mode.\n      IAC WILL NAOHTS \n     \
    \    The data receiver requests or agrees to negotiate about output \n       \
    \  horizontal tabstops with the sender.  In the case where agreement has \n  \
    \       been reached and in the absence of further subnegotiations, the data \n\
    \         receiver alone is assumed to be handling output horizontal tabstops.\n\
    \      IAC WON'T NAOHTS \n         The data receiver refuses to negotiate about\
    \ output horizontal \n         tabstops, or demands a return to the unnegotiated\

    \         The data sender specifies, with the 8-bit value(s), which party should\n\
    \         handle output horizontal tabstop considerations and what the stops \n\
    \         should be.  The code for DS is 1.\n      IAC SB NAOHTS DR <8-bit value>\
    \ ... <8-bit value> IAC SE\n         The data receiver specifies, with the 8-bit\

  - "3. Default\n   DON'T NAOHTS/WON'T NAOHTS.\n      In the default absence of negotiations\
    \ concerning which party, data \n      sender or data receiver, is handling output\
    \ horizontal tabstops, neither \n      party is required to handle them and neither\
    \ party is prohibited from \n      handling them; but it is appropriate if at\
    \ least the data receiver \n      handles horizontal tabstops, albeit primitively.\n\
    \   DS and DR SB subcommands as follows (multiple 8-bit values are allowed only\
    \ \n   if each is greater than zero and less than 251):\n      8-bit value : \
    \                    Meaning :\n      0            Command sender suggests that\
    \ he alone will handle  \n                   tabstops, for the connection.   \
    \                   \n      1 to 250     Command sender suggests that the other\
    \ party alone \n                   should handle tabstop considerations, but suggests\
    \ \n                   that the indicated value(s) be used. The value(s)  \n \
    \                  are the column numbers, relative to the physical   \n     \
    \              left side of the printer page or terminal screen,  \n         \
    \          that are to be set.                                \n      251 to 254\
    \   Not allowed, in order to be compatible with        \n                   related\
    \ Telnet options. \n      255          Command sender suggests that the other\
    \ party alone \n                   should handle output tabstops and suggests\
    \ nothing \n                   about how it should be done. \n   The guiding rules\
    \ are that:\n      (1) if neither data receiver nor data sender wants to handle\
    \ output \n      horizontal tabstops, the data receiver must do it, and\n    \
    \  (2) if both data receiver and data sender want to handle output \n      horizontal\
    \ tabstops, the data sender gets to do it.\n   The reasoning for the former rule\
    \ is that if neither wants to do it, then \n   the default in the NAOHTS option\
    \ dominates. If both want to do it, the \n   sender, who is presumed to have special\
    \ knowledge about the data, should be \n   allowed to do it, taking into account\
    \ any suggestions the receiver may make.\n   As with all option negotiations,\
    \ neither party should suggest a state \n   already in effect except to refuse\
    \ to negotiate; changes should be \n   acknowledged; and once refused, an option\
    \ should not be resuggested until \n"
