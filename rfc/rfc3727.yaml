  - "Abstract\n   This document updates the specification of the component matching\n\
    \   rules for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and X.500\n   directories\
    \ (RFC3687) by collecting the Abstract Syntax Notation One\n   (ASN.1) definitions\
    \ of the component matching rules into an\n   appropriately identified ASN.1 module\
    \ so that other specifications\n   may reference the component matching rule definitions\
    \ from within\n   their own ASN.1 modules.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The structure or data type of data held in an attribute\
    \ of a\n   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [LDAP] or X.500 [X500]\n\
    \   directory is described by the attribute's syntax.  Attribute syntaxes\n  \
    \ range from simple data types, such as text string, integer, or\n   boolean,\
    \ to complex data types, for example, the syntaxes of the\n   directory schema\
    \ operational attributes.  RFC 3687 [CMR] defines a\n   generic way of matching\
    \ user selected components in a directory\n   attribute value of any arbitrarily\
    \ complex attribute syntax.\n   This document updates RFC 3687 by collecting the\
    \ Abstract Syntax\n   Notation One (ASN.1) [ASN1] definitions of RFC 3687 into\
    \ an\n   appropriately identified ASN.1 module so that other specifications\n\
    \   may reference these definitions from within their own ASN.1 modules.\n"
