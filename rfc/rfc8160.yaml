- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Secure Shell (SSH) connection protocol [RFC4254] provides\
    \ an\n   encoding for terminal modes, used in the \"pty-req\" channel request\n\
    \   type.\n   A commonly used terminal mode is IUTF8, which indicates that the\n\
    \   terminal driver should assume that terminal I/O uses the UTF-8\n   character\
    \ encoding [RFC3629].  This is typically used by the kernel's\n   terminal driver\
    \ on the server to decide how many bytes of input to\n   treat as a single logical\
    \ character during line editing.\n   SSH does not currently provide an encoding\
    \ for IUTF8.  This document\n   specifies one.\n"

    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  New IUTF8 Opcode for Terminal Mode Encoding
  contents:
  - "3.  New IUTF8 Opcode for Terminal Mode Encoding\n   The opcode value 42 is defined\
    \ for the IUTF8 terminal mode.\n   As specified in Section 8 of [RFC4254], all\
    \ opcodes in the range 1 to\n   159 have a single uint32 argument; therefore,\
    \ the IUTF8 opcode is\n   followed by a single uint32 argument.  The value 0 indicates\
    \ that the\n   IUTF8 mode is disabled, and the value 1 indicates that it is enabled.\n\
    \   As with all other encoded terminal modes, the client SHOULD transmit\n   a\
    \ value for this mode if it knows about one, and the server MAY\n   ignore it.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   This document augments the list of \"Pseudo-Terminal\
    \ Encoded Terminal\n   Modes\" defined in Section 8 of [RFC4254].\n   IANA has\
    \ added the following opcode to the \"Pseudo-Terminal Encoded\n   Terminal Modes\"\
    \ registry:\n   opcode  mnemonic       description\n   ------  --------      \
    \ -----------\n   42      IUTF8          Terminal input and output is assumed\
    \ to be\n                           encoded in UTF-8.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of [RFC4254] apply.\
    \  This additional\n   terminal mode encoding is believed to have no security\
    \ implications\n   differing from the existing set of encoded terminal modes.\n\
    \   Since the IUTF8 terminal mode is intended for use in conjunction with\n  \
    \ the UTF-8 character encoding, the security considerations of\n   [RFC3629] also\
    \ apply to systems in which this mode is enabled.  In\n   particular, terminal\
    \ drivers that interpret this bit as enabling\n   UTF-8-aware line-editing behavior\
    \ should carefully consider how that\n   behavior will treat illegal sequences,\
    \ overlong encodings, and\n   redundant representations of composed characters\
    \ (see [UNICODE]).\n"
