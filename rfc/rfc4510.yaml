    \  protocol for accessing distributed directory services that act in\n   accordance
    with X.500 data and service models.  This document\n   provides a road map of
    the LDAP Technical Specification.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  The LDAP Technical Specification\n   The technical specification detailing
    version 3 of the Lightweight\n   Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), an Internet
    Protocol, consists of\n   this document and the following documents:\n      LDAP:
    The Protocol [RFC4511]\n      LDAP: Directory Information Models [RFC4512]\n      LDAP:
    Authentication Methods and Security Mechanisms [RFC4513]\n      LDAP: String Representation
    of Distinguished Names [RFC4514]\n      LDAP: String Representation of Search
    Filters [RFC4515]\n      LDAP: Uniform Resource Locator [RFC4516]\n      LDAP:
    Syntaxes and Matching Rules [RFC4517]\n      LDAP: Internationalized String Preparation
    [RFC4518]\n      LDAP: Schema for User Applications [RFC4519]\n   The terms \"LDAP\"
    and \"LDAPv3\" are commonly used to refer informally\n   to the protocol specified
    by this technical specification.  The LDAP\n   suite, as defined here, should
    be formally identified in other\n   documents by a normative reference to this
    document.\n   LDAP is an extensible protocol.  Extensions to LDAP may be specified\n
    \  in other documents.  Nomenclature denoting such combinations of\n   LDAP-plus-extensions
    is not defined by this document but may be\n   defined in some future document(s).
    \ Extensions are expected to be\n   truly optional.  Considerations for the LDAP
    extensions described in\n   BCP 118, RFC 4521 [RFC4521] fully apply to this revision
    of the LDAP\n   Technical Specification.\n   IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)
    considerations for LDAP\n   described in BCP 64, RFC 4520 [RFC4520] apply fully
    to this revision\n   of the LDAP technical specification.\n"
  - contents:
    - "1.1.  Conventions\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
      \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and
      \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
      14 [RFC2119].\n"
    title: 1.1.  Conventions
  title: 1.  The LDAP Technical Specification
- contents:
  - "2.  Relationship to X.500\n   This technical specification defines LDAP in terms
    of [X.500] as an\n   X.500 access mechanism.  An LDAP server MUST act in accordance
    with\n   the X.500 (1993) series of International Telecommunication Union -\n
    \  Telecommunication Standardization (ITU-T) Recommendations when\n   providing
    the service.  However, it is not required that an LDAP\n   server make use of
    any X.500 protocols in providing this service.\n   For example, LDAP can be mapped
    onto any other directory system so\n   long as the X.500 data and service models
    [X.501][X.511], as used in\n   LDAP, are not violated in the LDAP interface.\n
    \  This technical specification explicitly incorporates portions of\n   X.500(93).
    \ Later revisions of X.500 do not automatically apply to\n   this technical specification.\n"
  title: 2.  Relationship to X.500
- contents:
  - "3.  Relationship to Obsolete Specifications\n   This technical specification,
    as defined in Section 1, obsoletes\n   entirely the previously defined LDAP technical
    specification defined\n   in RFC 3377 (and consisting of RFCs 2251-2256, 2829,
    2830, 3771, and\n   3377 itself).  The technical specification was significantly\n
    \  reorganized.\n   This document replaces RFC 3377 as well as Section 3.3 of
    RFC 2251.\n   [RFC4512] replaces portions of RFC 2251, RFC 2252, and RFC 2256.\n
    \  [RFC4511] replaces the majority RFC 2251, portions of RFC 2252, and\n   all
    of RFC 3771.  [RFC4513] replaces RFC 2829, RFC 2830, and portions\n   of RFC 2251.
    \ [RFC4517] replaces the majority of RFC 2252 and\n   portions of RFC 2256.  [RFC4519]
    replaces the majority of RFC 2256.\n   [RFC4514] replaces RFC 2253.  [RFC4515]
    replaces RFC 2254.  [RFC4516]\n   replaces RFC 2255.\n   [RFC4518] is new to this
    revision of the LDAP technical\n   specification.\n   Each document of this specification
    contains appendices summarizing\n   changes to all sections of the specifications
    they replace.  Appendix\n   A.1 of this document details changes made to RFC 3377.
    \ Appendix A.2\n   of this document details changes made to Section 3.3 of RFC
    2251.\n   Additionally, portions of this technical specification update and/or\n
    \  replace a number of other documents not listed above.  These\n   relationships
    are discussed in the documents detailing these portions\n   of this technical
    specification.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   LDAP security considerations are discussed in
    each document\n   comprising the technical specification.\n"
