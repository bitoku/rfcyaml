- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) has been through\
    \ several\n   revisions and variants in its 10-year history.  Many of these are\n\
    \   either extinct or extremely rare; in particular, several undocumented\n  \
    \ variants and the variants described in RFC 1064, RFC 1176, and RFC\n   1203\
    \ fall into this category.\n   One variant, IMAP2bis, is at the time of this writing\
    \ very common and\n   has been widely distributed with the Pine mailer.  Unfortunately,\n\
    \   there is no definite document describing IMAP2bis.  This document is\n   intended\
    \ to be read along with RFC 1176 and the most recent IMAP4\n   specification (RFC\
    \ 2060) to assist implementors in creating an IMAP4\n   implementation to interoperate\
    \ with implementations that conform to\n   earlier specifications.  Nothing in\
    \ this document is required by the\n   IMAP4 specification; implementors must\
    \ decide for themselves whether\n   they want their implementation to fail if\
    \ it encounters old software.\n   At the time of this writing, IMAP4 has been\
    \ updated from the version\n   described in RFC 1730.  An implementor who wishes\
    \ to interoperate\n   with both RFC 1730 and RFC 2060 should refer to both documents.\n\
    \   This information is not complete; it reflects current knowledge of\n   server\
    \ and client implementations as well as \"folklore\" acquired in\n   the evolution\
    \ of the protocol.  It is NOT a description of how to\n   interoperate with all\
    \ variants of IMAP, but rather with the old\n   variant that is most likely to\
    \ be encountered.  For detailed\n   information on interoperating with other old\
    \ variants, refer to RFC\n   1732.\n"
- title: IMAP4 client interoperability with IMAP2bis servers
  contents:
  - "IMAP4 client interoperability with IMAP2bis servers\n   A quick way to check\
    \ whether a server implementation supports the\n   IMAP4 specification is to try\
    \ the CAPABILITY command.  An OK response\n   will indicate which variant(s) of\
    \ IMAP4 are supported by the server.\n   If the client does not find any of its\
    \ known variant in the response,\n   it should treat the server as IMAP2bis. \
    \ A BAD response indicates an\n   IMAP2bis or older server.\n   Most IMAP4 facilities\
    \ are in IMAP2bis.  The following exceptions\n   exist:\n   CAPABILITY command\n\
    \            The absense of this command indicates IMAP2bis (or older).\n   AUTHENTICATE\
    \ command.\n            Use the LOGIN command.\n   LSUB, SUBSCRIBE, and UNSUBSCRIBE\
    \ commands\n            No direct functional equivalent.  IMAP2bis had a concept\n\
    \            called \"bboards\" which is not in IMAP4.  RFC 1176 supported\n \
    \           these with the BBOARD and FIND BBOARDS commands.  IMAP2bis\n     \
    \       augmented these with the FIND ALL.BBOARDS, SUBSCRIBE BBOARD,\n       \
    \     and UNSUBSCRIBE BBOARD commands.  It is recommended that\n            none\
    \ of these commands be implemented in new software,\n            including servers\
    \ that support old clients.\n   LIST command\n            Use the command FIND\
    \ ALL.MAILBOXES, which has a similar syn-\n            tax and response to the\
    \ FIND MAILBOXES command described in\n            RFC 1176.  The FIND MAILBOXES\
    \ command is unlikely to produce\n            useful information.\n   * in a sequence\n\
    \            Use the number of messages in the mailbox from the EXISTS\n     \
    \       unsolicited response.\n   SEARCH extensions (character set, additional\
    \ criteria)\n            Reformulate the search request using only the RFC 1176\
    \ syn-\n            tax.  This may entail doing multiple searches to achieve the\n\
    \            desired results.\n   BODYSTRUCTURE fetch data item\n            Use\
    \ the non-extensible BODY data item.\n   body sections HEADER, TEXT, MIME, HEADER.FIELDS,\
    \ HEADER.FIELDS.NOT\n            Use body section numbers only.\n   BODY.PEEK[section]\n\
    \            Use BODY[section] and manually clear the \\Seen flag as\n       \
    \     necessary.\n   FLAGS.SILENT, +FLAGS.SILENT, and -FLAGS.SILENT store data\
    \ items\n            Use the corresponding non-SILENT versions and ignore the\n\
    \            untagged FETCH responses which come back.\n   UID fetch data item\
    \ and the UID commands\n            No functional equivalent.\n   CLOSE command\n\
    \            No functional equivalent.\n   In IMAP2bis, the TRYCREATE special\
    \ information token is sent as a\n   separate unsolicited OK response instead\
    \ of inside the NO response.\n   IMAP2bis is ambiguous about whether or not flags\
    \ or internal dates\n   are preserved on COPY.  It is impossible to know what\
    \ behavior is\n   supported by the server.\n"

  - "IMAP4 server interoperability with IMAP2bis clients\n   The only interoperability\
    \ problem between an IMAP4 server and a\n   well-written IMAP2bis client is an\
    \ incompatibility with the use of\n   \"\\\" in quoted strings.  This is best\
    \ avoided by using literals\n   instead of quoted strings if \"\\\" or <\"> is\
    \ embedded in the string.\n"
