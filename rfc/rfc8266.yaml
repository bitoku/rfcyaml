  - "1.1.  Overview\n   A number of technologies and applications provide the ability\
    \ for a\n   person to choose a memorable, human-friendly name in a communications\n\
    \   context or to set such a name for another entity such as a device,\n   account,\
    \ contact, or website.  Such names are variously called\n   \"nicknames\" (e.g.,\
    \ in chat room applications), \"display names\" (e.g.,\n   in Internet mail),\
    \ or \"petnames\" (see [PETNAME-SYSTEMS]); for\n   consistency, these are all\
    \ called \"nicknames\" in this document.\n   Nicknames are commonly supported\
    \ in technologies for textual chat\n   rooms, such as:\n   o  Internet Relay Chat\
    \ (IRC) [RFC2811]\n   o  The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) [RFC4975] [RFC7701]\n\
    \   o  Centralized Conferencing (XCON) [RFC5239] [XCON-SYSTEM]\n   o  The Extensible\
    \ Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [RFC6120]\n      [XEP-0045]\n   Recent\
    \ chat room technologies also allow internationalized nicknames\n   because they\
    \ support code points from outside the ASCII range\n   [RFC20], typically by means\
    \ of the Unicode coded character set\n   [Unicode].  Although such nicknames tend\
    \ to be used primarily for\n   display purposes, they are sometimes used for programmatic\
    \ purposes\n   as well (e.g., kicking users out of a chat room or avoiding nickname\n\
    \   conflicts).\n   A similar usage enables a person to set their own preferred\
    \ display\n   name or to set a preferred display name for another user (e.g.,\
    \ the\n   \"display-name\" construct in the Internet message format [RFC5322]\
    \ and\n   the <nick/> element in XMPP [XEP-0172]).\n   Memorable, human-friendly\
    \ names are also used in contexts other than\n   personal messaging, such as names\
    \ for devices (e.g., in a network\n   visualization application), websites (e.g.,\
    \ for bookmarks in a web\n   browser), accounts (e.g., in a web interface for\
    \ a list of payees in\n   a bank account), people (e.g., in a contact list application),\
    \ and\n   the like.\n   The rules specified in this document can be applied in\
    \ all of the\n   foregoing contexts.\n   It is important to understand that a\
    \ nickname is a personally\n   memorable name or handle for something that has\
    \ a more stable,\n   underlying identity, such as a URI or a file path.  To ensure\
    \ secure\n   operation of applications that use nicknames, authentication and\n\
    \   authorization decisions MUST be made on the basis of the thing's\n   identity,\
    \ not its nickname.\n   To increase the likelihood that memorable, human-friendly\
    \ names will\n   work in ways that make sense for typical users throughout the\
    \ world,\n   this document defines rules for handling nicknames in terms of the\n\
    \   preparation, enforcement, and comparison of internationalized strings\n  \
    \ (PRECIS) framework specification [RFC8264].\n"

  - "1.2.  Terminology\n   Many important terms used in this document are defined\

- title: 2.1.  Rules
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Rules\n   The following rules apply within the Nickname profile of the\
    \ PRECIS\n   FreeformClass defined in the PRECIS framework specification\n   [RFC8264].\n\
    \   1.  Width Mapping Rule: There is no width mapping rule (such a rule\n    \
    \   is not necessary because width mapping is performed as part of\n       normalization\
    \ using Normalization Form KC (NFKC) as specified\n       below).\n   2.  Additional\
    \ Mapping Rule: The additional mapping rule consists of\n       the following\
    \ sub-rules.\n       a.  Map any instances of non-ASCII space to SPACE (U+0020);\
    \ a\n           non-ASCII space is any Unicode code point having a general\n \
    \          category of \"Zs\", naturally with the exception of SPACE\n       \
    \    (U+0020).  (The inclusion of only ASCII space prevents\n           confusion\
    \ with various non-ASCII space code points, many of\n           which are difficult\
    \ to reproduce across different input\n           methods.)\n       b.  Remove\
    \ any instances of the ASCII space character at the\n           beginning or end\
    \ of a nickname (e.g., \"stpeter \" is mapped to\n           \"stpeter\").\n \
    \      c.  Map interior sequences of more than one ASCII space character\n   \
    \        to a single ASCII space character (e.g., \"St  Peter\" is\n         \
    \  mapped to \"St Peter\").\n   3.  Case Mapping Rule: Apply the Unicode toLowerCase()\
    \ operation, as\n       defined in the Unicode Standard [Unicode].  In applications\
    \ that\n       prohibit conflicting nicknames, this rule helps to reduce the\n\
    \       possibility of confusion by ensuring that nicknames differing\n      \
    \ only by case (e.g., \"stpeter\" vs. \"StPeter\") would not be\n       presented\
    \ to a human user at the same time.  (As explained below,\n       this is typically\
    \ appropriate only for comparison, not for\n       enforcement.)\n   4.  Normalization\
    \ Rule: Apply Unicode Normalization Form KC.  Because\n       NFKC is more \"\
    aggressive\" in finding matches than other\n       normalization forms (in the\
    \ terminology of Unicode, it performs\n       both canonical and compatibility\
    \ decomposition before recomposing\n       code points), this rule helps to reduce\
    \ the possibility of\n       confusion by increasing the number of code points\
    \ that would\n       match; for example, the character \"\u2163\" (ROMAN NUMERAL\
    \ FOUR,\n       U+2163) would match the combination of \"I\" (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER\n\
    \       I, U+0049) and \"V\" (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER V, U+0056).\n   5.  Directionality\
    \ Rule: There is no directionality rule.  The \"Bidi\n       Rule\" (defined in\
    \ [RFC5893]) and similar rules are unnecessary\n       and inapplicable to nicknames,\
    \ because it is perfectly acceptable\n       for a given nickname to be presented\
    \ differently in different\n       layout systems (e.g., a user interface that\
    \ is configured to\n       handle primarily a right-to-left script versus an interface\
    \ that\n       is configured to handle primarily a left-to-right script), as\n\
    \       long as the presentation is consistent in any given layout\n       system.\n\
    \   Implementation experience has shown that applying the rules for the\n   Nickname\
    \ profile is not an idempotent procedure for all code points.\n   Therefore, an\
    \ implementation SHOULD apply the rules repeatedly until\n   the output string\
    \ is stable; if the output string does not stabilize\n   after reapplying the\
    \ rules three (3) additional times after the first\n   application, the implementation\
    \ SHOULD terminate application of the\n   rules and reject the input string as\
    \ invalid.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Preparation
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Preparation\n   An entity that prepares an input string for subsequent\
    \ enforcement\n   according to this profile MUST ensure that the string consists\
    \ only\n   of Unicode code points that conform to the FreeformClass string class\n\
    \   defined in [RFC8264].\n"
- title: 2.3.  Enforcement
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Enforcement\n   An entity that performs enforcement according to this profile\
    \ MUST\n   prepare an input string as described in Section 2.2 and MUST also\n\
    \   apply the following rules specified in Section 2.1 in the order\n   shown:\n\
    \   1.  Additional Mapping Rule\n   2.  Normalization Rule\n   Note: An entity\
    \ SHOULD apply the Case Mapping Rule only during\n   comparison.\n   After all\
    \ of the foregoing rules have been enforced, the entity MUST\n   ensure that the\
    \ nickname is not zero bytes in length (this is done\n   after enforcing the rules\
    \ to prevent applications from mistakenly\n   omitting a nickname entirely, because\
    \ when internationalized strings\n   are accepted a non-empty sequence of characters\
    \ can result in a zero-\n   length nickname after canonicalization).\n   The result\
    \ of the foregoing operations is an output string that\n   conforms to the Nickname\
    \ profile.  Until an implementation produces\n   such an output string, it MUST\
    \ NOT treat the string as conforming (in\n   particular, it MUST NOT assume that\
    \ an input string is conforming\n   before the enforcement operation has been\
    \ completed).\n"
- title: 2.4.  Comparison
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Comparison\n   An entity that performs comparison of two strings according\
    \ to this\n   profile MUST prepare each input string as specified in Section 2.2\n\
    \   and MUST apply the following rules specified in Section 2.1 in the\n   order\
    \ shown:\n   1.  Additional Mapping Rule\n   2.  Case Mapping Rule\n   3.  Normalization\
    \ Rule\n   The two strings are to be considered equivalent if and only if they\n\
    \   are an exact octet-for-octet match (sometimes called \"bit-string\n   identity\"\
    ).\n   Until an implementation determines whether two strings are to be\n   considered\
    \ equivalent, it MUST NOT treat them as equivalent (in\n   particular, it MUST\
    \ NOT assume that two input strings are equivalent\n   before the comparison operation\
    \ has been completed).\n"

    \              Table 1: A Sample of Legal Nicknames\n   Regarding examples 5,\
    \ 6, and 7: applying the Unicode toLowerCase()\n   operation to the character\
    \ \"\u03A3\" (GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA, U+03A3)\n   results in the character\
    \ \"\u03C3\" (GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA, U+03C3);\n   however, the toLowerCase()\
    \ operation does not modify the character\n   \"\u03C2\" (GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL\
    \ SIGMA, U+03C2).  Therefore, the\n   comparison operation defined in Section\
    \ 2.4 would result in matching\n   of the nicknames in examples 5 and 6 but not\
    \ the nicknames in\n   examples 5 and 7 or 6 and 7.\n   Regarding example 8: this\
    \ is an instance where applying the rules for\n   the Nickname profile is not\
    \ an idempotent procedure (see\n   Section 2.1).  In particular:\n   1.  Applying\
    \ toLowerCase() to the character \"\u03D4\" (GREEK UPSILON WITH\n       DIARESIS\
    \ AND HOOK SYMBOL, U+03D4) results in no changes, and\n       applying NFKC to\
    \ that character results in the character \"\u03AB\"\n       (GREEK CAPITAL LETTER\
    \ UPSILON WITH DIALYTIKA, U+03AB).\n   2.  Applying toLowerCase() to \"\u03AB\"\
    \ (GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON WITH\n       DIALYTIKA, U+03AB) results in the\
    \ character \"\u03CB\" (GREEK SMALL\n       LETTER UPSILON WITH DIALYTIKA, U+03CB),\
    \ and applying NFKC to that\n       character results in no changes.\n   Regarding\
    \ example 9: symbol characters such as \"\u221E\" (INFINITY, U+221E)\n   are allowed\
    \ by the PRECIS FreeformClass and thus can be used in\n   nicknames.\n   Regarding\
    \ example 10: applying the Unicode toLowerCase() operation to\n   the character\
    \ \"\u2163\" (ROMAN NUMERAL FOUR, U+2163) results in the\n   character \"\u2173\
    \" (SMALL ROMAN NUMERAL FOUR, U+2173), and applying NFKC\n   to the character\
    \ \"\u2173\" (SMALL ROMAN NUMERAL FOUR, U+2173) results in\n   the characters\
    \ \"i\" (LATIN SMALL LETTER I, U+0069) and \"v\" (LATIN\n   SMALL LETTER V, U+0076).\n"
- title: 4.  Use in Application Protocols
  contents:
  - "4.  Use in Application Protocols\n   This specification defines only the PRECIS-based\
    \ rules for handling\n   of nickname strings.  It is the responsibility of an\
    \ application\n   protocol (e.g., MSRP, XCON, or XMPP) or application definition\
    \ to\n   specify the protocol slots in which nickname strings can appear, the\n\
    \   entities that are expected to enforce the rules governing nickname\n   strings,\
    \ and the point during protocol processing or interface\n   handling when the\
    \ rules need to be enforced.  See Section 6 of\n   [RFC8264] for guidelines about\
    \ using PRECIS profiles in applications.\n   Above and beyond the PRECIS-based\
    \ rules specified here, application\n   protocols can also define application-specific\
    \ rules governing\n   nickname strings (rules regarding the minimum or maximum\
    \ length of\n   nicknames, further restrictions on allowable code points or character\n\
    \   ranges, safeguards to mitigate the effects of visually similar\n   characters,\
    \ etc.).\n   Naturally, application protocols can also specify rules governing\
    \ the\n   actual use of nicknames in applications (reserved nicknames,\n   authorization\
    \ requirements for using nicknames, whether certain\n   nicknames can be prohibited,\
    \ handling of duplicates, the relationship\n   between nicknames and underlying\
    \ identifiers such as SIP URIs or\n   Jabber IDs, etc.).\n   Entities that enforce\
    \ the rules specified in this document are\n   encouraged to be liberal in what\
    \ they accept by following this\n   procedure:\n   1.  Where possible, map characters\
    \ (e.g., through width mapping,\n       additional mapping, case mapping, or normalization)\
    \ and accept\n       the mapped string.\n   2.  If mapping is not possible (e.g.,\
    \ because a character is\n       disallowed in the FreeformClass), reject the\
    \ string.\n"

  - "6.1.  Authentication and Authorization\n   It is important to understand that\
    \ a nickname is a personally\n   memorable name or handle for something that has\
    \ a more stable,\n   underlying identity, such as a URI or a file path.  To ensure\
    \ secure\n   operation of applications that use nicknames, authentication and\n\
    \   authorization decisions MUST be made on the basis of the thing's\n   identity,\
    \ not its nickname.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.2.  Reuse of PRECIS\n   The security considerations described in [RFC8264]\

  contents:
  - "6.4.  Visually Similar Characters\n   [RFC8264] describes some of the security\
    \ considerations related to\n   visually similar characters, also called \"confusable\
    \ characters\" or\n   \"confusables\", and provides some examples of such characters.\n\
    \   Although the mapping rules defined in Section 2 of this document are\n   designed,\
    \ in part, to reduce the possibility of confusion about\n   nicknames, this document\
    \ does not provide more-detailed\n   recommendations regarding the handling of\
    \ visually similar\n   characters, such as those provided in [UTS39].\n"
