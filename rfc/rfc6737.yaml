  - "1.  Introduction\n   Capabilities exchange is an important component of the Diameter
    base\n   protocol [RFC6733], allowing peers to exchange identities and\n   Diameter
    capabilities (protocol version number, supported Diameter\n   applications, security
    mechanisms, etc.).  As defined in RFC 3588,\n   however, the capabilities exchange
    process takes place only once, at\n   the inception of a transport connection
    between a given pair of\n   peers.  Therefore, if a peer's capabilities change
    (due to a software\n   update, for example), the existing connection(s) must be
    torn down\n   (along with all of the associated user sessions) and restarted before\n
    \  the modified capabilities can be advertised.\n   This document defines a new
    Diameter application intended to allow\n   the dynamic update of a subset of Diameter
    peer capabilities over an\n   existing connection.  Because the Capabilities Update
    application\n   specified herein operates over an existing transport connection,\n
    \  modification of certain capabilities is prohibited.  Specifically,\n   modifying
    the security mechanism in use is not allowed; if the\n   security method used
    between a pair of peers is changed, the affected\n   connection MUST be restarted.\n"

  title: 2.  Specification of Requirements
- contents:
  - "3.  Diameter Protocol Considerations\n   This section details the relationship
    of the Diameter Capabilities\n   Update application to the Diameter base protocol.\n
    \  This document specifies Diameter Application-Id 10.  Diameter nodes\n   conforming
    to this specification MUST advertise support by including\n   the value 10 in
    the Auth-Application-Id of the Capabilities-Exchange-\n   Request (CER) and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer
    (CEA) commands\n   [RFC6733].\n"
  title: 3.  Diameter Protocol Considerations
- contents:
  - "4.  Capabilities Update\n   When the capabilities of a Diameter node conforming
    to this\n   specification change, the node MUST notify all of the nodes with\n
    \  which it has an open transport connection and which have also\n   advertised
    support for the Capabilities Update application using the\n   Capabilities-Update-Request
    (CUR) message (Section 4.1.1).  This\n   message allows the update of a peer's
    capabilities (supported\n   Diameter applications, etc.).\n   A Diameter node
    only issues a given command to those peers that have\n   advertised support for
    the Diameter application that defines the\n   command; a Diameter node must cache
    the supported applications in\n   order to ensure that unrecognized commands and/or
    Attribute-Value\n   Pairs (AVPs) are not unnecessarily sent to a peer.\n   The
    receiver of the CUR MUST determine common applications by\n   computing the intersection
    of its own set of supported Application\n   Ids against all of the Application-Id
    AVPs (Auth-Application-Id,\n   Acct-Application-Id, and Vendor-Specific-Application-Id)
    present in\n   the CUR.  The value of the Vendor-Id AVP in the Vendor-Specific-\n
    \  Application-Id MUST NOT be used during computation.\n   If the receiver of
    a CUR does not have any applications in common\n   with the sender, then it MUST
    return a Capabilities-Update-Answer\n   (CUA) (Section 4.1.2) with the Result-Code
    AVP set to\n   DIAMETER_NO_COMMON_APPLICATION [RFC6733], and it SHOULD disconnect\n
    \  the transport-layer connection.  However, if active sessions are\n   using
    the connection, peers MAY delay disconnection until the\n   sessions can be redirected
    or gracefully terminated.  Note that\n   receiving a CUA from a peer advertising
    itself as a relay (see\n   [RFC6733], Section 2.4) MUST be interpreted as having
    common\n   applications with the peer.\n   As for CER/CEA messages, the CUR and
    CUA messages MUST NOT be\n   proxied, redirected, or relayed.\n   Even though
    the CUR/CUA messages cannot be proxied, it is still\n   possible for an upstream
    agent to receive a message for which there\n   are no peers available to handle
    the application that corresponds to\n   the Command Code.  This could happen if,
    for example, the peers are\n   too busy or down.  In such instances, the 'E' bit
    MUST be set in the\n   answer message with the Result-Code AVP set to\n   DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER
    to inform the downstream peer to take\n   action (e.g., re-routing requests to
    an alternate peer).\n"

    - "4.1.  Command Code Values\n   This section defines Command Code [RFC6733] values
      that MUST be\n   supported by all Diameter implementations conforming to this\n
      \  specification.  The following Command Codes are defined in this\n   document:
      Capabilities-Update-Request (CUR, Section 4.1.1), and\n   Capabilities-Update-Answer
      (CUA, Section 4.1.2).  The Diameter\n   Command Code Format (CCF) ([RFC6733],
      Section 3.2) is used in the\n   definitions.\n"

        failure, this\n   message MUST NOT be sent to an alternate peer.\n   When
        Diameter is run over the Stream Control Transmission Protocol\n   (SCTP) [RFC4960],
        which allows connections to span multiple\n   interfaces and multiple IP addresses,
        the Capabilities-Update-Request\n   message MUST contain one Host-IP-Address
