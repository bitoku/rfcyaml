  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)\n\
    \   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.\n   In\
    \ particular, it defines two MIB modules for managing the new\n   capabilities\
    \ of MAC bridges defined by the IEEE 802.1D-1998 MAC\n   Bridges and the IEEE\
    \ 802.1Q-1998 Virtual LAN (VLAN) standards for\n   bridging between Local Area\
    \ Network (LAN) segments.  One MIB module\n   defines objects for managing the\
    \ 'Traffic Classes' and 'Enhanced\n   Multicast Filtering' components of IEEE\
    \ 802.1D-1998.  The other MIB\n   module defines objects for managing IEEE 802.1Q\
    \ VLANs.\n   Provisions are made for support of transparent bridging.  Provisions\n\
    \   are also made so that these objects apply to bridges connected by\n   subnetworks\
    \ other than LAN segments.  This memo also includes several\n   MIB modules in\
    \ a manner that is compliant to the SMIv2 [V2SMI].\n   This memo supplements RFC\
    \ 1493 [BRIDGEMIB] and (to a lesser extent)\n   RFC 1525 [SBRIDGEMIB].\n"

- title: 1.  The SNMP Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The SNMP Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently\
    \ consists of five major\n   components:\n    o  An overall architecture, described\
    \ in an Architecture for\n       Describing SNMP Management Frameworks [ARCH].\n\
    \    o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the\n    \
    \   purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of\n       Management\
    \ Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD\n       16, RFC 1155\
    \ [V1SMI], STD 16, RFC 1212 [V1CONCISE] and RFC 1215\n       [V1TRAPS]. The second\
    \ version, called SMIv2, is described in STD\n       58, RFC 2578 [V2SMI], STD\
    \ 58, RFC 2579 [V2TC] and STD 58, RFC\n       2580 [V2CONFORM].\n    o  Message\
    \ protocols for transferring management information.  The\n       first version\
    \ of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and\n       described in STD 15,\
    \ RFC 1157 [V1PROTO].  A second version of the\n       SNMP message protocol,\
    \ which is not an Internet standards track\n       protocol, is called SNMPv2c\
    \ and described in RFC 1901\n       [V2COMMUNITY] and RFC 1906 [V2TRANS].  The\
    \ third version of the\n       message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described\
    \ in RFC 1906\n       [V2TRANS], Message Processing and Dispatching [V3MPC] and\
    \ User-\n       based Security Model [V3USM].\n    o  Protocol operations for\
    \ accessing management information.  The\n       first set of protocol operations\
    \ and associated PDU formats is\n       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [V1PROTO].\
    \  A second set of\n       protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described\
    \ in\n       RFC 1905 [V2PROTO].\n    o  A set of fundamental applications described\
    \ in SNMPv3\n       Applications [V3APPS] and the view-based access control mechanism\n\
    \       described in View-based Access Control Model [V3VACM].\n   Managed objects\
    \ are accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information\
    \ Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n   defined using the mechanisms defined\
    \ in the SMI.\n   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.\
    \  A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate\n\
    \   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically\n   equivalent,\
    \ except where objects or events are omitted because no\n   translation is possible\
    \ (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable\n   information in SMIv2 will be\
    \ converted into textual descriptions in\n   SMIv1 during the translation process.\
    \  However, this loss of machine\n   readable information is not considered to\
    \ change the semantics of the\n   MIB.\n"
- title: 2.  Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  Overview\n   A common device present in many networks is the Bridge.  This\
    \ device\n   is used to connect Local Area Network segments below the network\n\
    \   layer.  These devices are often known as 'layer 2 switches'.\n   There are\
    \ two major modes defined for this bridging: Source-Route and\n   transparent.\
    \  Source-Route bridging is described by IEEE 802.5\n   [802.5].  and is not discussed\
    \ further in this document.\n   The transparent method of bridging is defined\
    \ by IEEE 802.1D-1998\n   [802.1D] which is an update to the original IEEE 802.1D\
    \ specification\n   [802.1D-ORIG].  Managed objects for that original specification\
    \ of\n   transparent bridging were defined in RFC 1493 [BRIDGEMIB].\n   The original\
    \ IEEE 802.1D is augmented by IEEE 802.1Q-1998 [802.1Q] to\n   provide support\
    \ for 'virtual bridged LANs' where a single bridged\n   physical LAN network may\
    \ be used to support multiple logical bridged\n   LANs, each of which offers a\
    \ service approximately the same as that\n   defined by IEEE 802.1D.  Such virtual\
    \ LANs (VLANs) are an integral\n   feature of switched LAN networks.  A VLAN can\
    \ be viewed as a group of\n   end-stations on multiple LAN segments and can communicate\
    \ as if they\n   were on a single LAN.  IEEE 802.1Q defines port-based Virtual\
    \ LANs\n   where membership is determined by the bridge port on which data\n \
    \  frames are received.  This memo defines the objects needed for the\n   management\
    \ of port-based VLANs in bridge entities.\n   This memo defines those objects\
    \ needed for the management of a\n   bridging entity operating in the transparent\
    \ mode, as well as some\n   objects applicable to all types of bridges.  Managed\
    \ objects for\n   Source-Route bridging are defined in RFC 1525 [SRBRIDGEMIB].\n"
- title: 2.1.  Scope
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Scope\n   This MIB includes a comprehensive set of managed objects which\n\
    \   attempts to match the set defined in IEEE 802.1D and IEEE 802.1Q.\n   However,\
    \ to be consistent with the spirit of the SNMP Framework, a\n   subjective judgement\
    \ was made to omit the objects from those\n   standards most 'costly' to implement\
    \ in an agent and least\n   'essential' for fault and configuration management.\
    \  The omissions\n   are described in section 3 below.\n   Historical note:\n\
    \   The original bridge MIB [BRIDGEMIB] used the following principles for\n  \
    \ determining inclusion of an object in the BRIDGE-MIB module:\n   (1)   Start\
    \ with a small set of essential objects and add only as\n         further objects\
    \ are needed.\n   (2)   Require objects be essential for either fault or configuration\n\
    \         management.\n   (3)   Consider evidence of current use and/or utility.\n\
    \   (4)   Limit the total of objects.\n   (5)   Exclude objects which are simply\
    \ derivable from others in\n         this or other MIBs.\n   (6)   Avoid causing\
    \ critical sections to be heavily instrumented.\n         The  guideline that\
    \ was followed is one counter per critical\n         section per layer.\n"
- title: 3.  Structure of MIBs
  contents:
  - "3.  Structure of MIBs\n   This document defines additional objects, on top of\
    \ those existing in\n   the original BRIDGE-MIB module defined in [BRIDGEMIB]:\
    \ that MIB\n   module is to be maintained unchanged for backwards compatibility.\n\
    \   Section 3.4.3 of the present document contains some recommendations\n   regarding\
    \ usage of objects in the original bridge MIB by devices\n   implementing the\
    \ enhancements defined here.\n   Two MIB modules are defined here:\n   (1)   Managed\
    \ objects for an extended bridge MIB module P-BRIDGE-MIB\n         for the traffic\
    \ class and multicast filtering enhancements\n         defined by IEEE 802.1D-1998\
    \ [802.1D].\n   (2)   Managed objects for a virtual bridge MIB module Q-BRIDGE-MIB\n\
    \         for the Virtual LAN bridging enhancements defined by IEEE\n        \
    \ 802.1Q-1998 [802.1Q].\n"

- title: 3.4.2.  Relation to Interfaces MIB
  contents:
  - "3.4.2.  Relation to Interfaces MIB\n   The Interfaces Group MIB [INTERFACEMIB],\
    \ requires that any MIB which\n   is an adjunct of the Interfaces Group MIB, clarify\
    \ specific areas\n   within the Interfaces Group MIB.  These areas were intentionally\
    \ left\n   vague in the Interfaces Group MIB to avoid over-constraining the MIB,\n\
    \   thereby precluding management of certain media-types.\n   The Interfaces Group\
    \ MIB enumerates several areas which a media-\n   specific MIB must clarify. \
    \ Each of these areas is addressed in a\n   following subsection.  The implementor\
    \ is referred to the Interfaces\n   Group MIB in order to understand the general\
    \ intent of these areas.\n   In the Interfaces Group MIB, the 'interfaces' group\
    \ is defined as\n   being mandatory for all systems and contains information on\
    \ an\n   entity's interfaces, where each interface is thought of as being\n  \
    \ attached to a `subnetwork'.  (Note that this term is not to be\n   confused\
    \ with `subnet' which refers to an addressing partitioning\n   scheme used in\
    \ the Internet suite of protocols.)  The term 'segment'\n   is used in this memo\
    \ to refer to such a subnetwork, whether it be an\n   Ethernet segment, a 'ring',\
    \ a WAN link, or even an X.25 virtual\n   circuit.\n   Implicit in this Extended\
    \ Bridge MIB is the notion of ports on a\n   bridge.  Each of these ports is associated\
    \ with one interface of the\n   'interfaces' group (one row in ifTable) and, in\
    \ most situations, each\n   port is associated with a different interface.  However,\
    \ there are\n   situations in which multiple ports are associated with the same\n\
    \   interface.  An example of such a situation would be several ports\n   each\
    \ corresponding one-to-one with several X.25 virtual circuits but\n   all on the\
    \ same interface.\n   Each port is uniquely identified by a port number.  A port\
    \ number has\n   no mandatory relationship to an interface number, but in the\
    \ simple\n   case a port number will have the same value as the corresponding\n\
    \   interface's interface number.  Port numbers are in the range\n   (1..dot1dBaseNumPorts).\n\
    \   Some entities perform other functionality as well as bridging through\n  \
    \ the sending and receiving of data on their interfaces.  In such\n   situations,\
    \ only a subset of the data sent/received on an interface\n   is within the domain\
    \ of the entity's bridging functionality.  This\n   subset is considered to be\
    \ delineated according to a set of\n   protocols, with some protocols being bridged,\
    \ and other protocols not\n   being bridged.  For example, in an entity which\
    \ exclusively performed\n   bridging, all protocols would be considered as being\
    \ bridged, whereas\n   in an entity which performed IP routing on IP datagrams\
    \ and only\n   bridged other protocols, only the non-IP data would be considered\
    \ as\n   being bridged.  Thus, this Extended Bridge MIB (and in particular,\n\
    \   its counters) is applicable only to that subset of the data on an\n   entity's\
    \ interfaces which is sent/received for a protocol being\n   bridged.  All such\
    \ data is sent/received via the ports of the bridge.\n"
- title: 3.4.2.1.  Layering Model
  contents:
  - "3.4.2.1.  Layering Model\n   This memo assumes the interpretation of the Interfaces\
    \ Group to be in\n   accordance with the Interfaces Group MIB [INTERFACEMIB] which\
    \ states\n   that the interfaces table (ifTable) contains information on the\n\
    \   managed resource's interfaces and that each sub-layer below the\n   internetwork\
    \ layer of a network interface is considered an interface.\n   This document recommends\
    \ that, within an entity, VLANs which are\n   instantiated as an entry in dot1qVlanCurrentTable\
    \ by either\n   management configuration through dot1qVlanStaticTable or by dynamic\n\
    \   means (e.g.  through GVRP), are NOT also represented by an entry in\n   ifTable.\n\
    \   Where an entity contains higher-layer protocol entities e.g. IP-layer\n  \
    \ interfaces that transmit and receive traffic to/from a VLAN, these\n   should\
    \ be represented in the ifTable as interfaces of type\n   propVirtual(53).  Protocol-specific\
    \ types such as l3ipxvlan(137)\n   should not be used here since there is no implication\

  contents:

    \ defines a table\n   'ifStackTable' for describing the relationship between logical\n\
    \   interfaces within an entity.  It is anticipated that implementors\n   will\
    \ use this table to describe the binding of e.g. IP interfaces to\n   physical\
    \ ports, although the presence of VLANs makes the\n   representation less than\
    \ perfect for showing connectivity: the\n   ifStackTable cannot represent the\
    \ full capability of the IEEE 802.1Q\n   VLAN bridging standard since that makes\
    \ a distinction between VLAN\n   bindings on 'ingress' to and 'egress' from a\
    \ port: these\n   relationships may or may not be symmetrical whereas Interface\
    \ MIB\n   Evolution assumes a symmetrical binding for transmit and receive.\n\

    \ in the\n   original bridge MIB [BRIDGEMIB].\n   Much of the groundwork for this\
    \ document was performed by the IEEE\n   802.1 working group during the definition\
    \ of the IEEE 802.1D updates\n   [802.1D] and IEEE 802.1Q [802.1Q].\n   The authors\

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB that\n   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.\
    \  Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n\
    \   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment\
    \ without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.\n\
    \   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network\n   itself\
    \ is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no\n   control as\
    \ to who on the secure network is allowed to access and\n   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects in this MIB.\n   It is recommended that the implementers consider\
