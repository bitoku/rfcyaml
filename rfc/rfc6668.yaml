- title: 1.  Overview and Rationale
  contents:
  - "1.  Overview and Rationale\n   The Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC4251] is a very common\
    \ protocol for secure\n   remote login on the Internet.  Currently, SSH defines\
    \ data integrity\n   verification using SHA-1 and MD5 algorithms [RFC4253].  Due\
    \ to recent\n   security concerns with these two algorithms ([RFC6194] and [RFC6151],\n\
    \   respectively), implementors and users request support for data\n   integrity\
    \ verification using some of the SHA-2 family of secure hash\n   algorithms.\n"

- title: 2.  Data Integrity Algorithms
  contents:
  - "2.  Data Integrity Algorithms\n   This memo adopts the style and conventions\
    \ of [RFC4253] in specifying\n   how the use of new data integrity algorithms\
    \ are indicated in SSH.\n   The following new data integrity algorithms are defined:\n\
    \   hmac-sha2-256     RECOMMENDED   HMAC-SHA2-256\n                          \
    \         (digest length = 32 bytes,\n                                    key\
    \ length    = 32 bytes)\n   hmac-sha2-512     OPTIONAL      HMAC-SHA2-512\n  \
    \                                 (digest length = 64 bytes,\n               \
    \                     key length    = 64 bytes)\n                          Figure\
    \ 1\n   The Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) mechanism was\n   originally\
    \ defined in [RFC2104] and has been updated in [RFC6151].\n   The SHA-2 family\
    \ of secure hash algorithms is defined in\n   [FIPS-180-3].\n   Sample code for\
    \ the SHA-based HMAC algorithms are available in\n   [RFC6234].  The variants,\
    \ HMAC-SHA2-224 and HMAC-SHA2-384 algorithms,\n   were considered but not added\
    \ to this list as they have the same\n   computational requirements of HMAC-SHA2-256\
    \ and HMAC-SHA2-512,\n   respectively, and do not seem to be much used in practice.\n\
    \   Test vectors for use of HMAC with SHA-2 are provided in [RFC4231].\n   Users,\
    \ implementors, and administrators may choose to put these new\n   MACs into the\
    \ proposal ahead of the REQUIRED hmac-sha1 algorithm\n   defined in [RFC4253]\
    \ so that they are negotiated first.\n"

    \ apply to this\n   document.\n   The National Institute of Standards and Technology\
    \ (NIST)\n   publications: NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-107 [800-107] and\n\
    \   NIST SP 800-131A [800-131A] suggest that HMAC-SHA1 and HMAC-SHA2-256\n   have\
    \ a security strength of 128 bits and 256 bits, respectively,\n   which are considered\
    \ acceptable key lengths.\n   Many users seem to be interested in the perceived\
    \ safety of using the\n   SHA2-based algorithms for hashing.\n"
