  - "Abstract\n   OTP [OTP] provides a useful authentication mechanism for situations\n
    \  where there is limited client or server trust.  Currently, OTP is\n   added
    to protocols in an ad-hoc fashion with heuristic parsing.  This\n   specification
    defines an OTP SASL [SASL] mechanism so it can be\n   easily and formally integrated
    into many application protocols.\n"

  title: 1. How to Read This Document
- contents:
  - "2. Intended Use\n   The OTP SASL mechanism replaces the SKEY SASL mechanism [SASL].
    \ OTP\n   is a good choice for usage scenarios where the client is untrusted\n
    \  (e.g., a kiosk client), as a one-time password will only give the\n   client
    a single opportunity to act on behalf of the user.  OTP is\n   also a good choice
    for situations where interactive logins are\n   permitted to the server, as a
    compromised OTP authentication database\n   is only subject to dictionary attacks,
    unlike authentication\n   databases for other simple mechanisms such as CRAM-MD5
    [CRAM-MD5].\n   It is important to note that each use of the OTP mechanism causes
    the\n   authentication database entry for a user to be updated.\n   This SASL
    mechanism provides a formal way to integrate OTP into\n   SASL-enabled protocols
    including IMAP [IMAP4], ACAP [ACAP], POP3\n   [POP-AUTH] and LDAPv3 [LDAPv3].\n"
  title: 2. Intended Use
- contents:
  - "3. Profiling OTP for SASL\n   OTP [OTP] and OTP extended responses [OTP-EXT]
    offer a number of\n   options.  However, for authentication to succeed, the client
    and\n   server need compatible option sets.  This specification defines a\n   single
    SASL mechanism: OTP.  The following rules apply to this\n   mechanism:\n   o   The
    extended response syntax MUST be used.\n   o   Servers MUST support the following
    four OTP extended responses:\n       \"hex\", \"word\", \"init-hex\" and \"init-word\".
    \ Servers MUST support\n       the \"word\" and \"init-word\" responses for the
    standard dictionary\n       and SHOULD support alternate dictionaries.  Servers
    MUST NOT\n       require use of any additional OTP extensions or options.\n   o
    \  Clients SHOULD support display of the OTP challenge to the user\n       and
    entry of an OTP in multi-word format.  Clients MAY also\n       support direct
    entry of the pass phrase and compute the \"hex\" or\n       \"word\" response.\n
    \  o   Clients MUST indicate when authentication fails due to the\n       sequence
    number getting too low and SHOULD offer the user the\n       option to reset the
    sequence using the \"init-hex\" or \"init-word\"\n       response.\n   Support
    for the MD5 algorithm is REQUIRED, and support for the SHA1\n   algorithm is RECOMMENDED.\n"
  title: 3. Profiling OTP for SASL
- contents:
  - "4. OTP Authentication Mechanism\n   The mechanism does not provide any security
    layer.\n   The client begins by sending a message to the server containing the\n
    \  following two pieces of information.\n   (1) An authorization identity.  When
    the empty string is used, this\n   defaults to the authentication identity.  This
    is used by system\n   administrators or proxy servers to login with a different
    user\n   identity.  This field may be up to 255 octets and is terminated by a\n
    \  NUL (0) octet.  US-ASCII printable characters are preferred, although\n   UTF-8
    [UTF-8] printable characters are permitted to support\n   international names.
    \ Use of character sets other than US-ASCII and\n   UTF-8 is forbidden.\n   (2)
    An authentication identity.  The identity whose pass phrase will\n   be used.
    \ This field may be up to 255 octets.  US-ASCII printable\n   characters are preferred,
    although UTF-8 [UTF-8] printable characters\n   are permitted to support international
    names.  Use of character sets\n   other than US-ASCII and UTF-8 is forbidden.\n
    \  The server responds by sending a message containing the OTP challenge\n   as
    described in OTP [OTP] and OTP extended responses [OTP-EXT].\n   If a client sees
    an unknown hash algorithm name it will not be able\n   to process a pass phrase
    input by the user.  In this situation the\n   client MAY prompt for the six-word
    format, issue the cancel sequence\n   as specified by the SASL profile for the
    protocol in use and try a\n   different SASL mechanism, or close the connection
    and refuse to\n   authenticate.  As a result of this behavior, a server is restricted\n
    \  to one OTP hash algorithm per user.\n   On success, the client generates an
    extended response in the \"hex\",\n   \"word\", \"init-hex\" or \"init-word\"
    format.  The client is not required\n   to terminate the response with a space
    or a newline and SHOULD NOT\n   include unnecessary whitespace.\n   Servers MUST
    tolerate input of arbitrary length, but MAY fail the\n   authentication if the
    length of client input exceeds reasonable size.\n"

  - "5. Examples\n   In these example, \"C:\" represents lines sent from the client
    to the\n   server and \"S:\" represents lines sent from the server to the client.\n
    \  The user name is \"tim\" and no authorization identity is provided.\n   The
    \"<NUL>\" below represents an ASCII NUL octet.\n   The following is an example
    of the OTP mechanism using the ACAP\n   [ACAP] profile of SASL.  The pass phrase
    used in this example is:\n             This is a test.\n          C: a001 AUTHENTICATE
    \"OTP\" {4}\n          C: <NUL>tim\n          S: + \"otp-md5 499 ke1234 ext\"\n
    \         C: \"hex:5bf075d9959d036f\"\n          S: a001 OK \"AUTHENTICATE completed\"\n
    \       Here is the same example using the six-words response:\n          C: a001
    AUTHENTICATE \"OTP\" {4}\n          C: <NUL>tim\n          S: + \"otp-md5 499
    ke1234 ext\"\n          C: \"word:BOND FOGY DRAB NE RISE MART\"\n          S:
    a001 OK \"AUTHENTICATE completed\"\n        Here is the same example using the
    OTP-SHA1 mechanism:\n          C: a001 AUTHENTICATE \"OTP\" {4}\n          C:
    <NUL>tim\n          S: + \"otp-sha1 499 ke1234 ext\"\n          C: \"hex:c90fc02cc488df5e\"\n
    \         S: a001 OK \"AUTHENTICATE completed\"\n        Here is the same example
    with the init-hex extended response\n          C: a001 AUTHENTICATE \"OTP\" {4}\n
    \         C: <NUL>tim\n          S: + \"otp-md5 499 ke1234 ext\"\n          C:
    \"init-hex:5bf075d9959d036f:md5 499 ke1235:3712dcb4aa5316c1\"\n          S: a001
    OK \"OTP sequence reset, authentication complete\"\n     The following is an example
    of the OTP mechanism using the IMAP\n     [IMAP4] profile of SASL.  The pass phrase
    used in this example is:\n          this is a test\n       C: a001 AUTHENTICATE
    OTP\n       S: +\n       C: AHRpbQ==\n       S: + b3RwLW1kNSAxMjMga2UxMjM0IGV4dA==\n
    \      C: aGV4OjExZDRjMTQ3ZTIyN2MxZjE=\n       S: a001 OK AUTHENTICATE completed\n
    \  Note that the lack of an initial client response and the base64\n   encoding
    are characteristics of the IMAP profile of SASL.  The server\n   challenge is
    \"otp-md5 123 ke1234 ext\" and the client response is\n   \"hex:11d4c147e227c1f1\".\n"

    beyond those\n   those described in SASL [SASL], OTP [OTP] and OTP extended responses\n
    \  [OTP-EXT].  A brief summary of these considerations follows:\n   This mechanism
    does not provide session privacy, server\n   authentication or protection from
    active attacks.\n   This mechanism is subject to passive dictionary attacks.  The\n
    \  severity of this attack can be reduced by choosing pass phrases well.\n   The
    server authentication database necessary for use with OTP need\n   not be plaintext-equivalent.\n
    \  Server implementations MUST protect against the race attack [OTP].\n"
  title: 6. Security Considerations
- contents:
  - "7. Multinational Considerations\n   As remote access is a crucial service, users
    are encouraged to\n   restrict user names and pass phrases to the US-ASCII character
    set.\n   However, if characters outside the US-ASCII chracter set are used in\n
    \  user names and pass phrases, then they are interpreted according to\n   UTF-8
    [UTF-8].\n   Server support for alternate dictionaries is strongly RECOMMENDED
    to\n   permit use of the six-word format with non-English words.\n"
