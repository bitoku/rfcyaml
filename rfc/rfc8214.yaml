- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes how EVPN can be used to support\
    \ VPWS in\n   MPLS/IP networks.  The use of EVPN mechanisms for VPWS (EVPN-VPWS)\n\
    \   brings the benefits of EVPN to Point-to-Point (P2P) services.  These\n   benefits\
    \ include Single-Active redundancy as well as All-Active\n   redundancy with flow-based\
    \ load-balancing.  Furthermore, the use of\n   EVPN for VPWS eliminates the need\
    \ for the traditional way of PW\n   signaling for P2P Ethernet services, as described\
    \ in Section 4.\n   [RFC7432] provides the ability to forward customer traffic\
    \ to/from a\n   given customer Attachment Circuit (AC), without any Media Access\n\
    \   Control (MAC) lookup.  This capability is ideal in providing P2P\n   services\
    \ (aka VPWS services).  [MEF] defines the Ethernet Virtual\n   Private Line (EVPL)\
    \ service as a P2P service between a pair of ACs\n   (designated by VLANs) and\
    \ the Ethernet Private Line (EPL) service,\n   in which all traffic flows are\
    \ between a single pair of ports that,\n   in EVPN terminology, would mean a single\
    \ pair of Ethernet Segments\n   ES(es).  EVPL can be considered as a VPWS with\
    \ only two ACs.  In\n   delivering an EVPL service, the traffic-forwarding capability\
    \ of EVPN\n   is based on the exchange of a pair of Ethernet Auto-Discovery (A-D)\n\
    \   routes, whereas for more general VPWS as per [RFC4664], the\n   traffic-forwarding\
    \ capability of EVPN is based on the exchange of a\n   group of Ethernet A-D routes\
    \ (one Ethernet A-D route per AC/ES).  In\n   a VPWS service, the traffic from\
    \ an originating Ethernet Segment can\n   be forwarded only to a single destination\
    \ Ethernet Segment; hence, no\n   MAC lookup is needed, and the MPLS label associated\
    \ with the per-EVPN\n   instance (EVI) Ethernet A-D route can be used in forwarding\
    \ user\n   traffic to the destination AC.\n   For both EPL and EVPL services,\
    \ a specific VPWS service instance is\n   identified by a pair of per-EVI Ethernet\
    \ A-D routes that together\n   identify the VPWS service instance endpoints and\
    \ the VPWS service\n   instance.  In the control plane, the VPWS service instance\
    \ is\n   identified using the VPWS service instance identifiers advertised by\n\
    \   each Provider Edge (PE) node.  In the data plane, the value of the\n   MPLS\
    \ label advertised by one PE is used by the other PE to send\n   traffic for that\
    \ VPWS service instance.  As with the Ethernet Tag in\n   standard EVPN, the VPWS\
    \ service instance identifier has uniqueness\n   within an EVPN instance.\n  \
    \ For EVPN routes, the Ethernet Tag IDs are set to zero for port-based,\n   VLAN-based,\
    \ and VLAN bundle interface mode and set to non-zero\n   Ethernet Tag IDs for\
    \ VLAN-aware bundle mode.  Conversely, for\n   EVPN-VPWS, the Ethernet Tag ID\
    \ in the Ethernet A-D route MUST be set\n   to a non-zero value for all four service\
    \ interface types.\n   In terms of route advertisement and MPLS label lookup behavior,\n\
    \   EVPN-VPWS resembles the VLAN-aware bundle mode of [RFC7432] such that\n  \
    \ when a PE advertises a per-EVI Ethernet A-D route, the VPWS service\n   instance\
    \ serves as a 32-bit normalized Ethernet Tag ID.  The value of\n   the MPLS label\
    \ in this route represents both the EVI and the VPWS\n   service instance, so\
    \ that upon receiving an MPLS-encapsulated packet,\n   the disposition PE can\
    \ identify the egress AC from the MPLS label and\n   subsequently perform any\
    \ required tag translation.  For the EVPL\n   service, the Ethernet frames transported\
    \ over an MPLS/IP network\n   SHOULD remain tagged with the originating VLAN ID\
    \ (VID), and any VID\n   translation MUST be performed at the disposition PE.\
    \  For the EPL\n   service, the Ethernet frames are transported as is, and the\
    \ tags\n   are not altered.\n   The MPLS label value in the Ethernet A-D route\
    \ can be set to the\n   Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) Network Identifier (VNI)\
    \ for VXLAN\n   encapsulation as per [RFC7348], and this VNI will have a local\
    \ scope\n   per PE and may also be equal to the VPWS service instance identifier\n\
    \   set in the Ethernet A-D route.  When using VXLAN encapsulation, the\n   BGP\
    \ Encapsulation extended community is included in the Ethernet A-D\n   route as\
    \ described in [EVPN-OVERLAY].  The VNI is like the MPLS label\n   that will be\
    \ set in the tunnel header used to tunnel Ethernet packets\n   from all the service\
    \ interface types defined in Section 2.  The\n   EVPN-VPWS techniques defined\
    \ in this document have no dependency on\n   the tunneling technology.\n   The\
    \ Ethernet Segment Identifier encoded in the Ethernet A-D per-EVI\n   route is\
    \ not used to identify the service.  However, it can be used\n   for flow-based\
    \ load-balancing and mass withdraw functions as per the\n   [RFC7432] baseline.\n\
    \   As with standard EVPN, the Ethernet A-D per-ES route is used for fast\n  \
    \ convergence upon link or node failure.  The Ethernet Segment route is\n   used\
    \ for auto-discovery of the PEs attached to a given multihomed\n   Customer Edge\
    \ node (CE) and to synchronize state between them.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  VLAN-Based Service Interface\n   With this service interface, a VPWS instance\
    \ identifier corresponds\n   to only a single VLAN on a specific interface.  Therefore,\
    \ there is a\n   one-to-one mapping between a VID on this interface and the VPWS\n\
    \   service instance identifier.  The PE provides the cross-connect\n   functionality\
    \ between an MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) identified by\n   the VPWS service\
    \ instance identifier and a specific <port, VLAN>.  If\n   the VLAN is represented\
    \ by different VIDs on different PEs and\n   different ES(es) (e.g., a different\
    \ VID per Ethernet Segment per PE),\n   then each PE needs to perform VID translation\
    \ for frames destined to\n   its Ethernet Segment.  In such scenarios, the Ethernet\
    \ frames\n   transported over an MPLS/IP network SHOULD remain tagged with the\n\
    \   originating VID, and a VID translation MUST be supported in the data\n   path\
    \ and MUST be performed on the disposition PE.\n"
- title: 2.2.  VLAN Bundle Service Interface
  contents:
  - "2.2.  VLAN Bundle Service Interface\n   With this service interface, a VPWS service\
    \ instance identifier\n   corresponds to multiple VLANs on a specific interface.\
    \  The PE\n   provides the cross-connect functionality between the MPLS label\n\
    \   identified by the VPWS service instance identifier and a group of\n   VLANs\
    \ on a specific interface.  For this service interface, each VLAN\n   is presented\
    \ by a single VID, which means that no VLAN translation is\n   allowed.  The receiving\
    \ PE can direct the traffic, based on the EVPN\n   label alone, to a specific\
    \ port.  The transmitting PE can\n   cross-connect traffic from a group of VLANs\

  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Port-Based Service Interface\n   This service interface is a special\

    \ this service interface maps to a\n   VLAN-based service interface (defined in\
    \ Section 2.1); thus, this\n   service interface is not used in EVPN-VPWS.  In\
    \ other words, if one\n   tries to define data-plane and control-plane behavior\
    \ for this\n   service interface, one would realize that it is the same as that\
    \ of\n   the VLAN-based service.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  BGP Extensions\n   This document specifies the use of the per-EVI Ethernet\
    \ A-D route to\n   signal VPWS services.  The ESI field is set to the customer\
    \ ES, and\n   the 32-bit Ethernet Tag ID field MUST be set to the VPWS service\n\
    \   instance identifier value.  The VPWS service instance identifier\n   value\
    \ MAY be set to a 24-bit value, and when a 24-bit value is used,\n   it MUST be\
    \ right-aligned.  For both EPL and EVPL services using a\n   given VPWS service\
    \ instance, the pair of PEs instantiating that VPWS\n   service instance will\
    \ each advertise a per-EVI Ethernet A-D route\n   with its VPWS service instance\
    \ identifier and will each be configured\n   with the other PE's VPWS service\
    \ instance identifier.  When each PE\n   has received the other PE's per-EVI Ethernet\
    \ A-D route, the VPWS\n   service instance is instantiated.  It should be noted\

    \             this flag indicates that the advertising PE is the\n           \
    \       primary PE.  MUST be set to 1 for multihoming\n                  All-Active\
    \ scenarios by all active PE(s).\n         B        If set to 1 in multihoming\
    \ Single-Active scenarios,\n                  this flag indicates that the advertising\
    \ PE is the\n                  backup PE.\n         C        If set to 1, a control\
    \ word [RFC4448] MUST be present\n                  when sending EVPN packets\
    \ to this PE.  It is\n                  recommended that the control word be included\
    \ in the\n                  absence of an entropy label [RFC6790].\n   L2 MTU\
    \ is a 2-octet value indicating the MTU in bytes.\n   A received L2 MTU of zero\
    \ means that no MTU checking against the\n   local MTU is needed.  A received\
    \ non-zero MTU MUST be checked against\n   the local MTU, and if there is a mismatch,\
    \ the local PE MUST NOT add\n   the remote PE as the EVPN destination for the\
    \ corresponding VPWS\n   service instance.\n   The usage of the per-ES Ethernet\
    \ A-D route is unchanged from its\n   usage in [RFC7432], i.e., the \"Single-Active\"\
    \ bit in the flags of the\n   ESI Label extended community will indicate if Single-Active\
    \ or\n   All-Active redundancy is used for this ES.\n   In a multihoming All-Active\
    \ scenario, there is no Designated\n   Forwarder (DF) election, and all the PEs\
    \ in the ES that are active\n   and ready to forward traffic to/from the CE will\
    \ set the P Flag.  A\n   remote PE will do per-flow load-balancing to the PEs\
    \ that set the\n   P Flag for the same Ethernet Tag and ESI.  The B Flag in\n\
    \   Control Flags SHOULD NOT be set in the multihoming All-Active\n   scenario\
    \ and MUST be ignored by receiving PE(s) if set.\n   In a multihoming Single-Active\
    \ scenario for a given VPWS service\n   instance, the DF election should result\
    \ in the primary-elected PE for\n   the VPWS service instance advertising the\
    \ P Flag set and the B Flag\n   clear, the backup-elected PE should advertise\
    \ the P Flag clear and\n   the B Flag set, and the rest of the PEs in the same\
    \ ES should signal\n   both the P Flag and the B Flag clear.  When the primary\
    \ PE/ES fails,\n   the primary PE will withdraw the associated Ethernet A-D routes\
    \ for\n   the VPWS service instance from the remote PE, and the remote PE\n  \
    \ should then send traffic associated with the VPWS instance to the\n   backup\
    \ PE.  DF re-election will happen between the PE(s) in the same\n   ES, and there\
    \ will be a newly elected primary PE and newly elected\n   backup PE that will\
    \ signal the P and B Flags as described.  A remote\n   PE SHOULD receive the P\
    \ Flag set from only one primary PE and the B\n   Flag set from only one backup\
    \ PE.  However, during transient\n   situations, a remote PE receiving a P Flag\
    \ set from more than one PE\n   will select the last advertising PE as the primary\
    \ PE when forwarding\n   traffic.  A remote PE receiving a B Flag set from more\
    \ than one PE\n   will select the last advertising PE as the backup PE.  A remote\
    \ PE\n   MUST receive a P Flag set from at least one PE before forwarding\n  \
    \ traffic.\n   If a network uses entropy labels per [RFC6790], then the C Flag\n\
    \   MUST NOT be set, and the control word MUST NOT be used when sending\n   EVPN-encapsulated\
    \ packets over a P2P LSP.\n"

    \ Model\n   iBGP sessions are established between PE1, PE2, ASBR1, and ASBR3,\n\
    \   possibly via a BGP route reflector.  Similarly, iBGP sessions are\n   established\
    \ among PE3, PE4, ASBR2, and ASBR4.  eBGP sessions are\n   established among ASBR1,\
    \ ASBR2, ASBR3, and ASBR4.\n   All PEs and ASBRs are enabled for the EVPN Subsequent\
    \ Address Family\n   Identifier (SAFI) and exchange per-EVI Ethernet A-D routes,\
    \ one route\n   per VPWS service instance.  For inter-AS option B, the ASBRs\n\
    \   re-advertise these routes with the NEXT_HOP attribute set to their IP\n  \
    \ addresses as per [RFC4271].  The link between the CE and the PE is\n   either\
    \ a C-tagged or S-tagged interface, as described in [802.1Q],\n   that can carry\
    \ a single VLAN tag or two nested VLAN tags, and it is\n   configured as a trunk\
    \ with multiple VLANs, one per VPWS service\n   instance.  It should be noted\
    \ that the VLAN ID used by the customer\n   at either end of a VPWS service instance\
    \ to identify that service\n   instance may be different, and EVPN doesn't perform\
    \ that translation\n   between the two values.  Rather, the MPLS label will identify\
    \ the\n   VPWS service instance, and if translation is needed, it should be\n\
    \   done by the Ethernet interface for each service.\n   For a single-homed CE,\
    \ in an advertised per-EVI Ethernet A-D route,\n   the ESI field is set to zero\
    \ and the Ethernet Tag ID is set to the\n   VPWS service instance identifier that\
    \ identifies the EVPL or EPL\n   service.\n   For a multihomed CE, in an advertised\
    \ per-EVI Ethernet A-D route, the\n   ESI field is set to the CE's ESI and the\
    \ Ethernet Tag ID is set to\n   the VPWS service instance identifier, which MUST\
    \ have the same value\n   on all PEs attached to that ES.  This allows an ingress\
    \ PE in a\n   multihoming All-Active scenario to perform flow-based load-balancing\n\
    \   of traffic flows to all of the PEs attached to that ES.  In all\n   cases,\
    \ traffic follows the transport paths, which may be asymmetric.\n   Either (1)\
    \ the VPWS service instance identifier encoded in the\n   Ethernet Tag ID in an\
    \ advertised per-EVI Ethernet A-D route MUST be\n   unique across all ASes or\
    \ (2) an ASBR needs to perform a translation\n   when the per-EVI Ethernet A-D\
    \ route is re-advertised by the ASBR from\n   one AS to the other AS.\n   A per-ES\
    \ Ethernet A-D route can be used for mass withdraw to withdraw\n   all per-EVI\
    \ Ethernet A-D routes associated with the multihomed site\n   on a given PE.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.  EVPN Comparison to PW Signaling\n   In EVPN, service endpoint discovery and\
    \ label signaling are done\n   concurrently using BGP, whereas with VPWS based\
    \ on [RFC4448], label\n   signaling is done via LDP and service endpoint discovery\
    \ is either\n   through manual provisioning or through BGP.\n   In existing implementations\
    \ of VPWS using PWs, redundancy is limited\n   to Single-Active mode, while with\
    \ EVPN implementations of VPWS, both\n   Single-Active and All-Active redundancy\
    \ modes can be supported.\n   In existing implementations with PWs, backup PWs\
    \ are not used to\n   carry traffic, while with EVPN, traffic can be load-balanced\
    \ among\n   different PEs multihomed to a single CE.\n   Upon link or node failure,\
    \ EVPN can trigger failover with the\n   withdrawal of a single BGP route per\
    \ EVPL service or multiple EVPL\n   services, whereas with VPWS PW redundancy,\
    \ the failover sequence\n   requires the exchange of two control-plane messages:\
    \ one message to\n   deactivate the group of primary PWs and a second message\
    \ to activate\n   the group of backup PWs associated with the access link.\n \
    \  Finally, EVPN may employ data-plane egress link protection mechanisms\n   not\
    \ available in VPWS.  This can be done by the primary PE (on local\n   AC down)\
    \ using the label advertised in the per-EVI Ethernet A-D route\n   by the backup\
    \ PE to encapsulate the traffic and direct it to the\n   backup PE.\n"

  - "6.  Failure Scenarios\n   On a link or port failure between the CE and the PE\
    \ for both\n   single-homed and multihomed CEs, unlike [RFC7432], the PE MUST\n\
    \   withdraw all the associated Ethernet A-D routes for the VPWS service\n   instances\
    \ on the failed port or link.\n"
- title: 6.1.  Single-Homed CEs
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Single-Homed CEs\n   Unlike [RFC7432], EVPN-VPWS uses Ethernet A-D route\
    \ advertisements\n   for single-homed Ethernet Segments.  Therefore, upon a link/port\n\
    \   failure of a given single-homed Ethernet Segment, the PE MUST\n   withdraw\
    \ the associated per-EVI Ethernet A-D routes.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Multihomed CEs
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Multihomed CEs\n   For a faster convergence in multihomed scenarios with\
    \ either\n   Single-Active redundancy or All-Active redundancy, a mass withdraw\n\
    \   technique is used.  A PE previously advertising a per-ES Ethernet A-D\n  \
    \ route can withdraw this route by signaling to the remote PEs to\n   switch all\
    \ the VPWS service instances associated with this multihomed\n   ES to the backup\
    \ PE.\n   Just like RFC 7432, the Ethernet A-D per-EVI route MUST NOT be used\n\
    \   for traffic forwarding by a remote PE until it also receives the\n   associated\
    \ set of Ethernet A-D per-ES routes.\n"
