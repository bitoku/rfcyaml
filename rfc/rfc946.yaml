  title: Status of this Memo
- contents:
  - "Overview\n   In a community of users that share a large degree of common\n   facilities,
    it is often advantageous to use some common feature to\n   improve software performance
    and reduce initial implementation costs.\n   In March of 1982, CMU designed and
    implemented based on the growing\n   CMU PUP-based network a terminal location
    database and modified\n   existing network software to handle a 64-bit number
    which some call\n   the Terminal Location Number or TTYLOC for short.  The number
    can be\n   efficiently stored in operating systems tables and can be passed\n
    \  between various levels of operating system and network layering with\n   minimum
    modifications to existing software.  An initial evaluation of\n   changing software
    to communicate an unfixed or reasonable length\n   terminal location string indicated
    it would be expensive.\n   CMU now wishes to extend this mechanism into the TCP-based
    networking\n   support that is replacing the existing PUP-based software.  The\n
    \  mechanism is not viewed as a replacement for the Telnet Terminal\n   Location
    (SEND-LOCATION) Option but as a shorthand mechansim for\n   communicating hosts
    in the same community.\n"

  - "TTYLOC Number\n   The TTYLOC number is a 64-bit number composed of two (2) 32-bit\n
    \  numbers: The 32-bit official ARPA Internet host address (may be any\n   one
    of the addresses for multi-homed hosts) and a 32-bit number\n   representing the
    terminal on the specified host.  The host address of\n   [0.0.0.0] is defined
    to be \"unknown\", the terminal number of FFFFFFFF\n   (hex, r or-1 in decimal)
    is defined to be \"unknown\" and the terminal\n   number of FFFFFFFE (hex, or
    -2 in decimal) is defined to be\n   \"detached\" for processes that are not attached
    to a terminal.\n"

  - "2. Command Meanings\n   IAC WILL TTYLOC\n      The sender offers to send the
    TTYLOC information or confirms that\n      it can send the TTYLOC information.\n
    \  IAC WON'T TTYLOC\n      The sender refuses to send the TTYLOC information.\n
    \  IAC DO TTYLOC\n      The sender requests to receive the TTYLOC information
    or confirms\n      that it will receive the TTYLOC information.\n   IAC DON'T
    TTYLOC\n      The sender refuses to receive the TTYLOC information.\n   IAC SB
    TTYLOC <format> <TTYLOC number with IAC doubling> IAC SE\n      The sender is
    transmitting the TTYLOC information. The 64-bit\n      TTYLOC number has format
    0. The first 32-bits is the Internet host\n      number and the second 32-bits
    is the line on the specified\n      Internet host. The bytes are in most significant
    8-bit byte to\n      least significant byte order.\n"

  title: 3. Default Specification
- contents:
  - "4. Motivation\n   Many systems provide a mechanism for finding out where a user
    is\n   logged in from usually including information about telephone\n   extension
    and office occupants names. The information is useful for\n   physically locating
    people and/or calling them on the phone.\n   For incoming network connections
    to a host, only the remote host's\n   name is available. This option and the Telnet
    Terminal Location\n   option (RFC-779) provide the information to the system so
    it in turn\n   can provide the information to the various mechanisms (FINGER,
    WHOIS,\n   etc.).\n"

  - "5. Description of the Option\n   When the user Telnet connects to a remote host,
    it can attempt to\n   send the terminal location number information by doing a\n
    \  IAC WILL TTYLOC command. If the Telnet server can use the\n   information,
    it replies with a IAC DO TTYLOC command. The user Telnet\n   then sends the TTYLOC
    number in the subnegotiation.\n   It is recommended that if sending the TTYLOC
    number is refused then\n   the Telnet Terminal Location (SEND-LOCATION in RFC-779)
    should be\n   attempted.\n   The following are two example usage scenarios:\n
    \     User Side First:\n         (User) Host1: IAC WILL TTYLOC\n            Host1
    is asking if it can send the 64-bit terminal location\n            number (I will
    send...).\n         (Server) Host2: IAC DO TTYLOC\n            Host2 indicates
    to Host1 that it will accept the 64-bit\n            terminal location number
    in a subnegotiation (You please do\n            ...).\n         (User) Host1:
    IAC SB TTYLOC 0 <64-bit number> IAC SE\n            Host1 is sending the location
    number to Host2 which can\n            communicate the number to the operating
    system or other\n            system components.\n      Server Side First:\n         (Server)
    HostA: IAC DO TTYLOC\n            HostA indicates to HostB that it would like
    to know the\n            64-bit terminal location number (You please do ...).\n
    \        (User) HostB: IAC WILL TTYLOC\n            HostB agrees to send the 64-bit
    terminal location number to\n            HostA in a subnegotiation (I will send...).\n
    \        (User) HostB: IAC SB TTYLOC 0 <64-bit number> IAC SE\n            HostB
    is sending the location number to HostA which can\n            communicate the
    number to the operating system or other\n            system components.\n"
