  contents:
  - "1.2     Introduction to Directory Services\n   An electronic directory server\
    \ is an electronic process that provides\n   a list of information provided via\
    \ electronic access. This\n   information is variable in content, however it should\
    \ be explicitly\n   defined by the directory purpose. Information about people,\n\
    \   organizations, services, network hardware are just a few examples of\n   data\
    \ content that a directory service can provide. The aim of an\n   X.500 Directory\
    \ service is to make using the directory intuitive and\n   as easy to use as calling\
    \ for directory assistance. The X.500\n   Directory service is an international\
    \ standard ratified by the\n   International organization for Standardization\
    \ (IS) and the ITU-T\n   International Telecommunication Union formerly (CCITT)\
    \ in 1988 [1].\n   The Directory is intended to be global service comprised of\n\
    \   independently operated and distributed Directory Service Agents\n   (DSAs),\
    \ that provide information in the form of a White Pages Phone\n   Directory.\n\
    \   Electronic mail communication benefits from the existence of a global\n  \
    \ electronic White Pages to allow network users to retrieve addressing\n   information\
    \ in an intuitive fashion. Manual searching for names and\n   addresses, specifically\
    \ electronic addresses, can take a great deal\n   of time. A White Pages directory\
    \ service can enable network users to\n   retrieve the addresses of communication\
    \ partners in a user friendly\n   way, using known variables such as common name,\
    \ surname, and\n   organization to facilitate various levels of searches.\n  \
    \ In order to make global communication over computer networks work\n   efficiently,\
    \ a global electronic White Pages service is\n   indispensable. Such a directory\
    \ service could also contain telephone\n   and fax numbers, postal addresses as\
    \ well as platform type to\n   facilitate in translation of documents between\
    \ users on different\n   systems. An electronic White Pages may prove to be useful\
    \ for\n   specific local purposes; replacing paper directories or improving\n\
    \   quality of personnel administration for example. An electronic\n   directory\
    \ is much easier to produce and more timely than paper\n   directories which are\
    \ often out of date as soon as they are printed.\n   The Internet White Pages\
    \ Project provides many companies in the US\n   with an opportunity to pilot X.500\
    \ in their organizations.\n   Operating as a globally distributed directory service,\
    \ this project\n   allows organizations in a wide variety of industry type to\
    \ make\n   themselves known on the Internet and to provide access to their staff\n\
    \   as desired.\n   Some organizations, such as ESnet agreed to manage directory\n\
    \   information for other organizations. ESnet maintains data at their\n   site\
    \ for all the national laboratories. They provide assistance to\n   organizations\
    \ in defining their directory information tree (DIT)\n   structure. They also\
    \ provide free access to the X.500 Directory via\n   Gopher, WWW, DUAs, whois\
    \ and finger protocols.\n   The InterNIC is another directory services provider\
    \ on the Internet.\n   To date [June 1995] they hold X.500 directory data for\
    \ 52\n   organizations and provide free access to this data via various\n   protocols:\
    \ X.500 DUA, E-Mail, whois, Gopher and WWW.\n   To find the most current listing\
    \ of X.500 providers see RFC 1632 -\n   Catalog of Available X.500 Implementations\
    \ [2].\n"

- title: 2.2     The Directory Model
  contents:
  - "2.2     The Directory Model\n   X.500 Directory Model is a distributed collection\
    \ of independent\n   systems which cooperate to provide a logical data base of\
    \ information\n   to provide a global Directory Service. Directory information\
    \ about a\n   particular organization is maintained locally in a Directory System\n\
    \   Agent (DSA). This information is structured within specified\n   standards.\
    \ Adherence to these standards makes the distributed model\n   possible. It is\
    \ possible for one organization to keep information\n   about other organizations,\
    \ and it is possible for an organization to\n   operate independently from the\
    \ global model as a stand alone system.\n   DSAs that operate within the global\
    \ model have the ability to\n   exchange information with other DSAs by means\
    \ of the X.500 protocol.\n   DSAs that are interconnected form the Directory Information\
    \ Tree\n   (DIT). The DIT is a virtual hierarchical data structure. An X.500\n\
    \   pilot using QUIPU software introduced the concept of a \"root\" DSA\n   which\
    \ represents the world; below which \"countries\" are defined.\n   Defined under\
    \ the countries are \"organizations\". The organizations\n   further define \"\
    organizational units\" and/ or \"people\". This DIT\n   identifies the DIT for\
    \ the White Pages X.500 services.\n   Each DSA provides information for the global\
    \ directory. Directories\n   are able to locate in the hierarchical structure\
    \ discussed above,\n   which DSA holds a certain portion of the directory. Each\
    \ directory\n   manages information through a defined set of attributes and in\
    \ a\n   structure defined as the Directory Information Base (DIB).\n   A DSA is\
    \ accessed by means of a Directory User Agent (DUA). A DUA\n   interacts with\
    \ the Directory by communicating with one or more DSAs\n   as necessary to respond\
    \ to a specific query. DUAs can be an IP\n   protocol such as whois or finger,\
    \ or a more sophisticated application\n   which may provide Graphical User Interface\
    \ (GUI) access to the DSA.\n   Access to a DSA can be accomplished by an individual\
    \ or automated by\n   computer application.\n"
- title: 2.3     The Information Model
  contents:
  - "2.3     The Information Model\n   In addition to the Directory Model, the X.500\
    \ standard defines the\n   information model used in the Directory Service. All\
    \ information in\n   the Directory is stored in \"entries\", each of which belong\
    \ to at\n   least one \"object class\". In the White Pages application of X.500\n\
    \   object classes are defined as country, organization, organizational\n   unit\
    \ and person.\n   The object classes to which an entry belongs defines the attributes\n\
    \   associated with a particular entry. Some attributes are mandatory\n   others\
    \ are optional. System administrators may define their own\n   attributes and\
    \ register these with regulating authorities, which will\n   in turn make these\
    \ attributes available on a large scale.\n   Every entry has a Relative Distinguished\
    \ Name (RDN), which uniquely\n   identifies the entry. A RDN is made up of the\
    \ DIT information and the\n   actual entry.\n   The Directory operates under a\
    \ set of rules know as the Directory\n   schema.  This defines correct utilization\
    \ of attributes, and ensures\n   an element of sameness throughout the global\
    \ Directory Service.\n   Under the White Pages object class \"Person\" there are\
    \ three mandatory\n   attributes:\n        objectClass     commonName      surName\n\
    \   These attributes along with the DIT structure above, define the RDN.\n   An\
    \ example of an entry under Sandia National Laboratory is shown\n   here: @c=US@o=Sandia\
    \ National Laboratory@ou=Employees@cn=Barbara\n   Jennings\n                 \
    \                  root\n                                   /  \\\n          \
    \                        /    \\\n                                c=US    c=CA\n\
    \                                /  \\\n                               /    \\\
    \n                  o=Sandia National   o=ESnet\n                    Laboratory\n\

    \  ou=Guests\n              /                \\\n             /              \
    \    \\\n     cn=Barbara Jennings        cn=Paul Brooks\n   Organizations may\
    \ define the best structure suited for their DIT.\n   Typically an organizations\
    \ DIT will look very much like the\n   organizations structure itself. A DIT structure\
    \ is determined by\n   naming rules and as such, becomes the elements unique Relative\n\
    \   Distinguished Name (RDN). The DIT structure may also be dependent on\n   whether\
    \ the DSA information is administered by a flat file or a\n   database. Extra\
    \ consideration to designing of the DIT structure\n   should be taken when using\
    \ flat files versus a database, as it takes\n   longer to search through a flat\
    \ file if the tree structure becomes\n   too complex or intricate. To obtain information\
    \ on recommended schema\n   for DIT structuring see RFC1274 [3].\n"

  - "2.4     Benefits and Uses for X.500 Directory Service\n   The nature of the X.500\
    \ Directory makes it suitable for independently\n   operated segments that can\
    \ be expanded to global distribution. The\n   benefits for local directory use\
    \ are:\n   - with the distributed nature of the service, an organization may\n\
    \   separate the responsibility for management of many DSAs and still\n   retain\
    \ the overall structure;\n   - the robustness of this service allows it to provide\
    \ information to a\n   wide range of applications. Whereas globally integrated\
    \ projects must\n   conform to a specific DIT, independent X.500 operations may\
    \ define\n   unique DITs, object classes and attributes as per their specific\n\
    \   needs;\n   - X.500 is a good alternative for paper directories, offering the\n\
    \   ability to update and modify in an interactive mode. This allows a\n   company\
    \ to provide the most current information with less cost and\n   effort;\n   -\
    \ because of the electronic base of X.500, other electronic\n   applications may\
    \ interact with the application without human\n   intervention.\n   The benefits\
    \ for global directory use are:\n   - the distributed nature of X.500 is well\
    \ suited for large global\n   applications such as the White Pages Directory.\
    \ Maintenance can be\n   performed in a distributed manner;\n   - X.500 offers\
    \ good searching capabilities from any level in the DIT.\n   Also with \"User\
    \ Friendly Naming\" in place, searches are very\n   intuitive;\n   - there are\
    \ DUA interfaces for the White Pages service available for\n   all types of workstations.\
    \ For an overview of X.500 software reference\n   RFC1632.\n   - X.500 is an international\
    \ standard. Using such a standard ensures\n   interoperability within the worldwide\
    \ base.\n"
- title: 2.5     Other Applications of X.500
  contents:
  - "2.5     Other Applications of X.500\n   In addition to the White Pages, X.500\
    \ can be used as a source for any\n   type of information that needs a distributed\
    \ storage base.\n   The University of Michigan is using X.500 for electronic mail\n\
    \   routing. Any mail coming to the university domain, umich.edu; gets\n   expanded\
    \ out to a local address that is stored in the rfc822Mailbox\n   attribute. The\
    \ University also operates a standard X.500 name server\n   which provides name\
    \ lookup service of over 200,000 names. They use\n   the Lightweight Directory\
    \ Access Protocol (LDAP) [11].\n   An implementation of the X.500 Standard directory\
    \ service has been\n   incorporated into the Open Software Foundation (OSF) Distributed\n\
    \   Computing Environment (DCE). This component, known as the Global\n   Directory\
    \ Service (GDS), provides an area where distributed\n   application clients can\
    \ find their application servers. The GDS, in\n   response to requests made by\
    \ other clients, provides the unique\n   network address for a particular DCE\
    \ resource.  Because it is based\n   on a international standard, GDS can offer\
    \ access to resources among\n   users and organizations worldwide. This scalable\
    \ service can be\n   performed in DCE environments that range in size from the\
    \ very small\n   to the very large.\n   Lookup services can be implemented into\
    \ a variety of applications.\n   Cambridge University in Great Britain implemented\
    \ the X.500 directory\n   service into an employee locator application. Based\
    \ on badge sensors\n   at strategic locations, this application can determine\
    \ the\n   whereabouts of an employee on the campus. As the individual moves\n\
    \   about, the sensors register their location in an X.500 Directory.\n   Digital\
    \ Signature Service (DSS) and Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) work\n   on the principal\
    \ of a directory key server which generates and\n   provide users with \"public\"\
    \ codes that match previously registered\n   \"private\" codes. Only the recipient\
    \ can decipher messages sent in\n   this fashion. The X.509 [4] standard for key\
    \ certificates easily fits\n   within the structure of the X.500 Directory Service.\n"

  - "3.1     Introduction\n   Currently in the United States, there are no specific\
    \ legal rules for\n   the information that is provided via an electronic directory\
    \ service.\n   Various organizations and groups associated with usage of the\n\
    \   Internet, noting a need to address privacy and data integrity issues,\n  \
    \ have prepared directives to address this issue. Two such areas\n   addressed\
    \ are those of the rights of registrants included in the\n   directory and the\
    \ responsibility of administrators to guarantee the\n   integrity of such data.\n\
    \   Registries containing information that is related to an individual is\n  \
    \ freely transferred and unregulated in the US, unless the provider of\n   the\
    \ data is an agency or an holder of sensitive information as\n   defined by federal\
    \ legislation and further may differ for each state.\n   An agency is defined\
    \ as: any executive department, military\n   department, Government corporation,\
    \ Government controlled\n   corporation, or other establishment in the executive\
    \ branch of the\n   Government (including the Executive Office of the President),\
    \ or any\n   independent regulatory agency. Sensitive data can be financial\n\
    \   records, medical records, and certain legal documents. As previously\n   noted,\
    \ each state has their own legislation on sensitive or private\n   data.The registered\
    \ persons have little recourse to control list\n   information short of filing\
    \ a lawsuit against the information\n   provider.\n   For individuals who transfer\
    \ data across country boundaries, it is\n   important to understand that other\
    \ countries may have legislation to\n   regulate data. Prior to requesting list\
    \ information from these\n   countries, an administrator should review applicable\
    \ legislation and\n   have some mechanism in place to ensure how data will be\

    \ data and list\n   registrants and access rights must be clearly defined and\
    \ stated.\n   Initially this provides the skeleton of the DIT. Eventually a\n\
    \   statement such as this may provide a basis legally justifying the\n   directory.\n\
    \   All data presented must be defined in the purpose. If for example, a\n   directory\
    \ is for the sole purpose of providing professional\n   addressing information\
    \ - an entry would include name, postal address,\n   office telephone, facsimile\
    \ number, electronic mail address and\n   company name.  Private address information\
    \ listing the home address\n   or phone would be prohibited as would any other\

    \ Systems\n   International (PSI) provides a reliable QUIPU infrastructure for\n\
    \   sites wishing to provide their own X.500 directory. Started in 1989\n   as\

  contents:
  - "4.3     DUA Interfaces for End Users\n   There are a variety of user interfaces\
    \ on the market today that will\n   provide Directory User Agent access to the\
    \ X.500 Directory. Standard\n   protocols such as fred, whois, whois++, finger,\
    \ are used widely.\n   Interfaces are also available via World-wide Web browsers\
    \ and\n   electronic mail.\n   Vendors providing DUAs include ISODE Consortium,\
    \ NeXor, and Control\n   Data Corporation. These applications operate in conjunction\
    \ with the\n   vendor provided DSAs.\n   Historically DUA interfaces were difficult\
    \ to implement and required\n   the entire OSI stack. Implementing such a product\
    \ on a PC or Apple\n   platform required skillful programming. The executable\
    \ for these\n   platforms were usually very large. The IETF has since defined\
    \ and\n   standardized the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [11];\
    \ a\n   protocol for accessing on-line Directory services which offers\n   comparable\
    \ functionality to the Directory Access Protocol (DAP). It\n   runs directly over\
    \ TCP and is used by nearly all X.500 clients. LDAP\n   does not have the overhead\
    \ of the various OSI layers and runs on top\n   of TCP/IP.\n   The functionality\
    \ varies by specific DUA. Each offers access to the\n   X.500 Directory. Most\
    \ offer the ability to make modifications to\n   entries. There are a few that\
    \ offer Kerberos authentication.\n   Further information on LDAP clients for specific\
    \ platforms can be\n   found on the University of Michigan WWW server:\n   http://www.umich.edu/~rsug/ldap.\n\
    \   Another interface that has been tested and recommended for users by\n   our\
    \ Dutch (Surfnet) colleagues is Directory Enquiry (DE). Originally\n   developed\
    \ by University College London for the Paradise project in\n   Europe, the engineers\
    \ at Surfnet have selected DE as the best\n   interface for \"dumb\" terminals.\
    \ They have also translated the\n   interface into Dutch for their local users\
    \ [12].\n   Ideally, users should be able to access X.500 directly from their\n\
    \   electronic mail applications. Vendors (other than the ones mentioned\n   above)\
    \ have been slow to incorporate the X.500 Standards into their\n   electronic\
    \ mail applications.\n"
