  - "1.  Introduction\n   Multiprotocol Label Switching traffic engineering (MPLS-TE)\
    \ networks\n   are often deployed over transport networks such that the transport\n\
    \   networks provide connectivity between the Label Switching Routers\n   (LSRs)\
    \ in the MPLS-TE network.  Increasingly, these transport\n   networks are operated\
    \ using a Generalized Multiprotocol Label\n   Switching (GMPLS) control plane.\
    \  Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in the\n   GMPLS network provide connectivity as\
    \ virtual data links advertised\n   as TE links in the MPLS-TE network.\n   GMPLS\
    \ protocols were developed as extensions to MPLS-TE protocols.\n   MPLS-TE is\
    \ limited to the control of packet switching networks, but\n   GMPLS can also\
    \ control technologies at layers one and two.\n   The GMPLS network may be managed\
    \ by an operator as a separate network\n   (as it may have been when it was under\
    \ management plane control\n   before the use of GMPLS as a control plane), but\
    \ optimizations of\n   management and operation may be achieved by coordinating\
    \ the use of\n   the MPLS-TE and GMPLS networks and operating the two networks\
    \ with a\n   close client/server relationship.\n   GMPLS LSP setup may be triggered\
    \ by the signaling of MPLS-TE LSPs in\n   the MPLS-TE network so that the GMPLS\
    \ network is reactive to the\n   needs of the MPLS-TE network.  The triggering\
    \ process can be under\n   the control of operator policies without needing direct\
    \ intervention\n   by an operator.\n   The client/server configuration just described\
    \ can also apply in\n   migration scenarios for MPLS-TE packet switching networks\
    \ that are\n   being migrated to be under GMPLS control.  [RFC5145] describes\
    \ a\n   migration scenario called the Island Model.  In this scenario, groups\n\
    \   of nodes (islands) are migrated from the MPLS-TE protocols to the\n   GMPLS\
    \ protocols and operate entirely surrounded by MPLS-TE nodes (the\n   sea).  This\
    \ scenario can be effectively managed as a client/server\n   network relationship\
    \ using the framework described in this document.\n   In order to correctly manage\
    \ the dynamic interaction between the MPLS\n   and GMPLS networks, it is necessary\
    \ to understand the operational\n   requirements and the control that the operator\
    \ can impose.  Although\n   this problem is very similar to the multi-layer networks\
    \ described in\n   [MLN-REQ], it must be noted that those networks operate GMPLS\n\
    \   protocols in both the client and server networks, which facilitates\n   smoother\
    \ interworking.  Where the client network uses MPLS-TE\n   protocols over the\
    \ GMPLS server network, there is a need to study the\n   interworking of the two\
    \ protocol sets.\n   This document examines the protocol requirements for protocol\n\
    \   interworking to operate an MPLS-TE network as a client network over a\n  \
    \ GMPLS server network, and provides a framework for such operations.\n"

    \ Figure 1.  It\n   can easily be seen that the interworking between MPLS-TE and\
    \ GMPLS\n   protocols must occur on a node and not on a link.  Nodes on the\n\
    \   interface between the MPLS-TE and GMPLS networks must be responsible\n   for\
    \ handling both protocol sets and for providing any protocol\n   interworking\
    \ that is required.  We call these nodes Border Routers.\n       --------------\

    \   for use within the MPLS-TE client network at the end of the MPLS-TE\n   LSP.\
    \  This may require protocol mapping (and re-mapping), protocol\n   tunneling,\

  contents:
  - "3.2.  Triggered Establishment of GMPLS LSPs\n   The solution MUST provide the\
    \ ability to establish end-to-end MPLS-TE\n   LSPs over a GMPLS server network.\
    \  It SHOULD be possible for GMPLS\n   LSPs across the core network to be set\
    \ up between Border Routers\n   triggered by the signaling of MPLS-TE LSPs in\
    \ the client network, and\n   in this case, policy controls MUST be made available\
    \ at the border\n   routers so that the operator of the GMPLS network can manage\
    \ how core\n   network resources are utilized.  GMPLS LSPs MAY also be pre-\n\
    \   established as the result of management plane control.\n   Note that multiple\
    \ GMPLS LSPs may be set up between a given pair of\n   Border Routers in support\
    \ of connectivity in the MPLS client network.\n   If these LSPs are advertised\

    \ diverse both within the\n   client MPLS-TE network and as they cross the server\
    \ GMPLS network.\n   This means that there SHOULD be a mechanism to request the\
    \ provision\n   of diverse GMPLS LSPs between a pair of Border Routers to provide\n\
    \   protection of the GMPLS span, but also that there SHOULD be a way to\n   keep\

    \ advertisement of TE information from within an MPLS-TE client\n   network to\

    \ path for an LSP to a tail-end LSR that is reached\n   over the GMPLS server\
    \ network.\n   Where there is more than one client MPLS-TE network, the TE\n \

    \ is useful for the LSRs in the MPLS-TE\n   networks to compute paths that cross\
    \ the GMPLS server network and to\n   select the correct Border Routers to provide\
    \ connectivity.\n   The solution MUST NOT distribute TE information from within\
    \ a non-PSC\n   (Packet Switch Capable) GMPLS server network to any client MPLS-TE\n\
    \   network as that information may cause confusion and selection of\n   inappropriate\

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Border routers in the model described in this\
    \ document are present on\n   administrative domain boundaries.  That is, the\
    \ administrative\n   boundary does not lie on a link as it might in the inter-Autonomous-\n\
    \   System (inter-AS) case seen in IP networks.  Thus, many security\n   concerns\
    \ for the inter-domain exchange of control plane messages do\n   not arise in\
    \ this model -- the border router participates fully in\n   both the MPLS and\
    \ the GMPLS network and must participate in the\n   security procedures of both\
    \ networks.  Security considerations for\n   MPLS-TE and GMPLS protocols are discussed\
    \ in [SECURITY].\n   However, policy considerations at the border routers are\
    \ very\n   important and may be considered to form part of the security of the\n\
    \   networks.  In particular, the server network (the GMPLS network) may\n   wish\
    \ to protect itself from behavior in the client network (such as\n   frequent\
    \ demands to set up and tear down server LSPs) by appropriate\n   policies implemented\
    \ at the border routers.  It should be observed\n   that, because the border routers\
    \ form part of both networks, they are\n   trusted in both networks, and policies\
    \ configured (whether locally or\n   centrally) for use by a border router are\
    \ expected to be observed.\n   Nevertheless, authentication and access controls\
    \ for operators will\n   be particularly important at border routers.  Operators\
    \ of the client\n   MPLS-TE network MUST NOT be allowed to configure the server\
    \ GMPLS\n   network (including setting server network policies), and operators\
    \ of\n   the server GMPLS network MUST NOT be able configure the client MPLS-\n\
    \   TE network.  Obviously, it SHOULD be possible to grant an operator\n   privileges\
    \ in both networks.  It may also be desirable to give\n   operators of one network\
    \ access to (for example) status information\n   about the other network.\n  \
    \ Mechanisms for authenticating operators and providing access controls\n   are\
    \ not part of the responsibilities of the GMPLS protocol set, and\n   will depend\
    \ on the management plane protocols and techniques\n   implemented.\n"
- title: 5.  Recommended Solution Architecture
  contents:
  - "5.  Recommended Solution Architecture\n   The recommended solution architecture\
    \ to meet the requirements set\n   out in Section 3 is known as the Border Peer\
    \ Model.  This\n   architecture is a variant of the Augmented Model described\
    \ in\n   [RFC3945].  The remainder of this document presents an overview of\n\
    \   this architecture.\n   In the Augmented Model, routing information from the\
    \ lower layer\n   (server) network is filtered at the interface to the higher\
    \ layer\n   (client) network and a subset of the information is distributed\n\
    \   within the higher layer network.\n   In the Border Peer Model, the interface\
    \ between the client and server\n   networks is the Border Router.  This router\
    \ has visibility of the\n   routing information in the server network yet also\
    \ participates as a\n   peer in the client network.  Thus, the Border Router has\
    \ full\n   visibility into both networks.  However, the Border Router does not\n\
    \   distribute server routing information into the client network, nor\n   does\
    \ it distribute client routing information into the server\n   network.\n   The\
    \ Border Peer Model may also be contrasted with the Overlay Model\n   [RFC3945].\
    \  In this model there is a protocol request/response\n   interface (the user\
    \ network interface (UNI)) between the client and\n   server networks.  [RFC4208]\
    \ shows how this interface may be supported\n   by GMPLS protocols operated between\
    \ client edge and server edge\n   routers while retaining the routing information\
    \ within the server\n   network.  That is, in the Overlay Model there is no exchange\
    \ of\n   routing or reachability information between client and server\n   networks,\
    \ and no network element has visibility into both client and\n   server networks.\
    \  The Border Peer Model can be viewed as placing the\n   UNI within the Border\
    \ Router thus giving the Border Router peer\n   capabilities in both the client\
    \ and server network.\n"

  - "5.1.  Use of Contiguous, Hierarchical, and Stitched LSPs\n   All three LSP types\
    \ MAY be supported in the Border Peer Model, but\n   contiguous LSPs are the hardest\
    \ to support because they require\n   protocol mapping between the MPLS-TE client\
    \ network and the GMPLS\n   server network.  Such protocol mapping can be achieved\
    \ currently\n   since MPLS-TE signaling protocols are a subset of GMPLS, but this\n\
    \   mechanism is not future-proofed.\n   Contiguous and stitched LSPs can only\
    \ be supported where the GMPLS\n   server network has the same switching type\
    \ (that is, packet\n   switching) as the MPLS-TE network.  Requirements for independent\n\
    \   failure recovery within the GMPLS island require the use of loose\n   path\
    \ reoptimization techniques [RFC4736] and end-to-end make-before-\n   break [RFC3209],\
    \ which will not provide rapid recovery.\n   For these reasons, the use of hierarchical\

    \   MPLS-TE information is not consumed by the GMPLS LSRs.  But care is\n   required\
    \ to avoid swamping the control plane of the GMPLS network\n   with MPLS-TE control\
    \ plane (particularly routing) messages.\n   In order to ensure scalability, control\
    \ plane messages for the MPLS-\n   TE client network MAY be carried between Border\
    \ Routers in a single\n   hop MPLS-TE LSP routed through the data plane of the\
    \ GMPLS server\n   network.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Fast Reroute Protection
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Fast Reroute Protection\n   If the GMPLS network is packet switching, Fast\
    \ Reroute protection can\n   be offered on all hops of a contiguous LSP.  If the\
    \ GMPLS network is\n   packet switching then all hops of a hierarchical GMPLS\
    \ LSP or GMPLS\n   stitching segment can be protected using Fast Reroute.  If\
    \ the end-\n   to-end MPLS-TE LSP requests Fast Reroute protection, the GMPLS\
    \ packet\n   switching network SHOULD provide such protection.\n   However, note\
    \ that it is not possible to provide FRR node protection\n   of the upstream Border\
    \ Router without careful consideration of\n   available paths, and protection\
    \ of the downstream Border Router is\n   not possible where hierarchical LSPs\
    \ or stitching segments are used.\n   Note further that Fast Reroute is not available\
    \ in non-packet\n   technologies.  However, other protection techniques are supported\
    \ by\n   GMPLS for non-packet networks and are likely to provide similar\n   levels\
    \ of protection.\n   The limitations of FRR need careful consideration by the\
    \ operator and\n   may lead to the decision to provide end-to-end protection for\
    \ the\n   MPLS-TE LSP.\n"
- title: 5.4.  GMPLS LSP Advertisement
  contents:
  - "5.4.  GMPLS LSP Advertisement\n   In the Border Peer Model, the LSPs established\
    \ by the Border Routers\n   in the GMPLS server network SHOULD be advertised in\
    \ the MPLS-TE\n   client network as real or virtual links.  In case real links\
    \ are\n   advertised into the MPLS-TE client network, the Border Routers in the\n\
    \   MPLS-TE client network MAY establish IGP neighbors.  The Border\n   Routers\
    \ MAY automatically advertise the GMPLS LSPs when establishing\n   them.\n"
- title: 5.5.  GMPLS Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.5.  GMPLS Deployment Considerations\n   The Border Peer Model does not require\
    \ the existing MPLS-TE client\n   network to be GMPLS aware and does not affect\
    \ the operation and\n   management of the existing MPLS-TE client network.  Only\
    \ border\n   routers need to be upgraded with the GMPLS functionality.  In this\n\
    \   fashion, the Border Peer Model renders itself for incremental\n   deployment\
    \ of the GMPLS server network, without requiring\n   reconfiguration of existing\
    \ areas/ASs, changing operation of IGP and\n   BGP or software upgrade of the\
    \ existing MPLS-TE client network.\n"
