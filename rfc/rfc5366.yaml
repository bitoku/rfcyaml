- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Section 5.4 of [RFC4579] describes how to create a conference\
    \ using\n   ad hoc SIP [RFC3261] methods.  The client sends an INVITE request\
    \ to\n   a conference factory URI and receives the actual conference URI,\n  \
    \ which contains the \"isfocus\" feature tag, in the Contact header field\n  \
    \ of a response -- typically a 200 (OK) response.\n   Once the UAC (User Agent\
    \ Client) obtains the conference URI, it can\n   add participants to the newly\
    \ created conference in several ways,\n   which are described in [RFC4579].\n\
    \   Some environments have tough requirements regarding conference\n   establishment\
    \ time.  They require the UAC to be able to request the\n   creation of an ad\
    \ hoc conference and to provide the conference server\n   with the initial set\
    \ of participants in a single operation.  This\n   document describes how to meet\
    \ this requirement using the mechanism\n   to transport URI lists in SIP messages\
    \ described in [RFC5363].\n"

- title: 3.  User Agent Client Procedures
  contents:
  - "3.  User Agent Client Procedures\n   A UAC that wants to include the set of initial\
    \ participants in its\n   initial INVITE request to create an ad hoc conference\
    \ adds a body\n   whose disposition type is 'recipient-list', as defined in [RFC5363],\n\
    \   with a URI list that contains the participants that the UAC wants the\n  \
    \ conference server to invite.  Additionally, the UAC MUST include the\n   'recipient-list-invite'\
    \ option-tag (which is registered with the IANA\n   in Section 8) in a Require\
    \ header field.  The UAC sends this INVITE\n   request to the conference factory\
    \ URI.\n   The INVITE transaction is also part of an offer/answer exchange that\n\
    \   will establish a session between the UAC and the conference server,\n   as\
    \ specified in [RFC4579].  Therefore, the INVITE request may need to\n   carry\
    \ a multipart body: a session description and a URI list.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Response Handling
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Response Handling\n   The status code in the response to the INVITE request\
    \ does not\n   provide any information about whether or not the conference server\n\
    \   was able to bring the users in the URI list into the conference.\n   That\
    \ is, a 200 (OK) response means that the conference was created\n   successfully,\
    \ that the UAC that generated the INVITE request is in\n   the conference, and\
    \ that the server understood the URI list.  If the\n   UAC wishes to obtain information\
    \ about the status of other users in\n   the conference, it SHOULD use general\
    \ conference mechanisms, such as\n   the conference package, which is defined\
    \ in [RFC4575].\n"
- title: 3.2.  Re-INVITE Request Generation
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Re-INVITE Request Generation\n   The previous sections have specified how\
    \ to include a URI list in an\n   initial INVITE request to a conference server.\
    \  Once the INVITE-\n   initiated dialog between the UAC and the conference server\
    \ has been\n   established, the UAC can send subsequent INVITE requests (typically\n\
    \   referred to as re-INVITE requests) to the conference server to, for\n   example,\
    \ modify the characteristics of the media exchanged with the\n   server.\n   At\
    \ this point, there are no semantics associated with 'recipient-\n   list' bodies\
    \ in re-INVITE requests (although future extensions may\n   define them).  Therefore,\
    \ UACs SHOULD NOT include 'recipient-list'\n   bodies in re-INVITE requests sent\
    \ to a conference server.\n      Note that a difference between an initial INVITE\
    \ request and a\n      re-INVITE request is that while the initial INVITE request\
    \ is sent\n      to the conference factory URI, the re-INVITE request is sent\
    \ to\n      the URI provided by the server in a Contact header field when the\n\
    \      dialog was established.  Therefore, from the UAC's point of view,\n   \
    \   the resource identified by the former URI supports 'recipient-\n      list'\
    \ bodies, while the resource identified by the latter does not\n      support\
    \ them.\n"
- title: 4.  URI-List Document Format
  contents:
  - "4.  URI-List Document Format\n   As described in [RFC5363], specifications of\
    \ individual URI-list\n   services, like the conferencing service described here,\
    \ need to\n   specify a default format for 'recipient-list' bodies used within\
    \ the\n   particular service.\n   The default format for 'recipient-list' bodies\
    \ for conferencing UAs\n   (User Agents) is the XML resource list format (which\
    \ is specified in\n   [RFC4826]) extended with the \"Extensible Markup Language\
    \ (XML) Format\n   Extension for Representing Copy Control Attributes in Resource\
    \ Lists\"\n   [RFC5364].  Consequently, conferencing UACs generating 'recipient-\n\
    \   list' bodies MUST support both of these formats and MAY support other\n  \
    \ formats.  Conferencing servers able to handle 'recipient-list' bodies\n   MUST\
    \ support both of these formats and MAY support other formats.\n   As described\
    \ in \"Extensible Markup Language (XML) Format Extension\n   for Representing\
    \ Copy Control Attributes in Resource Lists\"\n   [RFC5364], each URI can be tagged\
    \ with a 'copyControl' attribute set\n   to either \"to\", \"cc\", or \"bcc\"\
    , indicating the role in which the\n   recipient will get the INVITE request.\
    \  Additionally, URIs can be\n   tagged with the 'anonymize' attribute to prevent\
    \ the conference\n   server from disclosing the target URI in a URI list.\n  \
    \ In addition, \"Extensible Markup Language (XML) Format Extension for\n   Representing\
    \ Copy Control Attributes in Resource Lists\" [RFC5364]\n   defines a 'recipient-list-history'\
    \ body that contains the list of\n   recipients.  The default format for 'recipient-list-history'\
    \ bodies\n   for conferencing UAs is also the XML resource list document format\n\
    \   specified in [RFC4826] extended with \"Extensible Markup Language\n   (XML)\
    \ Format Extension for Representing Copy Control Attributes in\n   Resource Lists\"\
    \ [RFC5364].  Consequently, conferencing UACs able to\n   generate 'recipient-list-history'\
    \ bodies MUST support these formats\n   and MAY support others.  Conferencing\
    \ UAs able to understand\n   'recipient-list-history' MUST support these formats\
    \ and MAY support\n   others.  Conferencing servers able to handle 'recipient-list-history'\n\
    \   bodies MUST support these formats and MAY support others.\n   Nevertheless,\
    \ the XML resource list document specified in [RFC4826]\n   provides features,\
    \ such as hierarchical lists and the ability to\n   include entries by reference\
    \ relative to the XML Configuration Access\n   Protocol (XCAP) root URI, that\
    \ are not needed by the conferencing\n   service defined in this document, which\
    \ only needs to transfer a flat\n   list of URIs between a UA (User Agent) and\
    \ the conference server.\n   Therefore, when using the default resource list document,\n\
    \   conferencing UAs SHOULD use flat lists (i.e., no hierarchical lists)\n   and\
    \ SHOULD NOT use <entry-ref> elements.  A conference factory\n   application receiving\
    \ a URI list with more information than what has\n   just been described MAY discard\
    \ all the extra information.\n   Figure 1 shows an example of a flat list that\
    \ follows the XML\n   resource list document (specified in [RFC4826]) extended\
    \ with\n   \"Extensible Markup Language (XML) Format Extension for Representing\n\
    \   Copy Control Attributes in Resource Lists\" [RFC5364].\n   <?xml version=\"\

- title: 5.  Conference Server Procedures
  contents:
  - "5.  Conference Server Procedures\n   Conference servers that are able to receive\
    \ and process INVITE\n   requests with a 'recipient-list' body SHOULD include\
    \ a 'recipient-\n   list-invite' option-tag in a Supported header field when responding\n\
    \   to OPTIONS requests.\n   On reception of an INVITE request containing a 'recipient-list'\
    \ body\n   as described in Section 3, a conference server MUST follow the rules\n\
    \   described in [RFC4579] to create ad hoc conferences.  Once the ad hoc\n  \
    \ conference is created, the conference server SHOULD attempt to add\n   the participants\
    \ in the URI list to the conference as if their\n   addition had been requested\
    \ using any of the methods described in\n   [RFC4579].\n   The INVITE transaction\
    \ is also part of an offer/answer exchange that\n   will establish a session between\
    \ the UAC and the conference server,\n   as specified in [RFC4579].  Therefore,\
    \ the INVITE request may carry a\n   multipart body: a session description and\
    \ a URI list.\n   Once the conference server has created the ad hoc conference\
    \ and has\n   attempted to add the initial set of participants, the conference\n\
    \   server behaves as a regular conference server and MUST follow the\n   rules\
    \ in [RFC4579].\n   The incoming INVITE request will contain a URI-list body or\
    \ reference\n   (as specified in [RFC5363]) with the actual list of recipients.\
    \  If\n   this URI list includes resources tagged with the 'copyControl'\n   attribute\
    \ set to a value of \"to\" or \"cc\", the conference server\n   SHOULD include\
    \ a URI list in each of the outgoing INVITE requests.\n   This list SHOULD be\
    \ formatted according to the XML format for\n   representing resource lists (specified\
    \ in [RFC4826]) and the\n   copyControl extension specified in [RFC5364].\n  \
    \ The URI-list service MUST follow the procedures specified in\n   [RFC5364] with\
    \ respect to the handling of the 'anonymize', 'count',\n   and 'copyControl' attributes.\n\
    \   If the conference server includes a URI list in an outgoing INVITE\n   request,\
    \ it MUST include a Content-Disposition header field (which is\n   specified in\
    \ [RFC2183]) with the value set to 'recipient-list-\n   history' and a 'handling'\
    \ parameter (as specified in [RFC3204]) set\n   to \"optional\".\n"

    \   request with a 'recipient-list' body and, consequently, a\n   'recipient-list-invite'\
    \ option-tag, following standard SIP\n   procedures, rejects it with a 420 (Bad\
    \ Extension), which carries an\n   Unsupported header field listing the 'recipient-list-invite'\
    \ option-\n   tag.\n      This is because the resource identified by the conference\
    \ URI does\n      not actually support this extension.  On the other hand, the\n\
    \      resource identified by the conference factory URI does support\n      this\

    \ using a request-\n   contained URI list.  Both conferencing and URI-list services\
    \ have\n   specific security requirements, which are summarized here.\n   Conferences\
    \ generally have authorization rules about who can or\n   cannot join a conference,\
    \ what type of media can or cannot be used,\n   etc.  This information is used\
    \ by the focus to admit or deny\n   participation in a conference.  It is RECOMMENDED\
    \ that these types of\n   authorization rules be used to provide security for\
    \ a SIP conference.\n   For this authorization information to be used, the focus\
    \ needs to be\n   able to authenticate potential participants.  Normal SIP mechanisms,\n\
    \   including Digest authentication and certificates, can be used.  These\n  \
    \ conference-specific security requirements are discussed further in\n   the requirements\
    \ and framework documents -- [RFC4245] and [RFC4353].\n   For conference creation\
    \ using a list, there are some additional\n   security considerations.  \"Framework\
    \ and Security Considerations for\n   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) URI-List\
    \ Services\" [RFC5363]\n   discusses issues related to SIP URI-list services.\
    \  Given that a\n   conference server sending INVITE requests to a set of users\
    \ acts as a\n   URI-list service, implementations of conference servers that handle\n\
    \   lists MUST follow the security-related rules in [RFC5363].  These\n   rules\
    \ include opt-in lists and mandatory authentication and\n   authorization of clients.\n"
