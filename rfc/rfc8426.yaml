- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Operators are looking to introduce services over Segment Routing\
    \ (SR)\n   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in networks running Resource Reservation\n\
    \   Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) LSPs.  In some instances,\n   operators\
    \ are also migrating existing services from RSVP-TE to SR\n   LSPs.  For example,\
    \ there might be certain services that are well\n   suited for SR and need to\
    \ coexist with RSVP-TE in the same network.\n   Such introduction or migration\
    \ of traffic to SR might require\n   coexistence with RSVP-TE in the same network\
    \ for an extended period\n   of time, depending on the operator's intent.  The\
    \ following document\n   provides solution options for keeping the traffic engineering\n\
    \   database consistent across the network, accounting for the different\n   bandwidth\
    \ utilization between SR and RSVP-TE.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Introduction of SR [RFC8402] in the same network domain\
    \ as RSVP-TE\n   [RFC3209] presents the problem of accounting for SR traffic and\n\
    \   making RSVP-TE aware of the actual available bandwidth on the network\n  \
    \ links.  RSVP-TE is not aware of how much bandwidth is being consumed\n   by\
    \ SR services on the network links; hence, both at computation time\n   (for a\
    \ distributed computation) and at signaling time, RSVP-TE LSPs\n   will incorrectly\
    \ place loads.  This is true where RSVP-TE paths are\n   distributed or centrally\
    \ computed without a common entity managing\n   both SR and RSVP-TE computation\
    \ for the entire network domain.\n   The problem space can be generalized as a\
    \ dark bandwidth problem to\n   cases where any other service exists in the network\
    \ that runs in\n   parallel across common links and whose bandwidth is not reflected\
    \ in\n   the available and reserved values in the Traffic Engineering Database\n\
    \   (TED).  In most practical instances, given the static nature of the\n   traffic\
    \ demands, limiting the reservable bandwidth available to RSVP-\n   TE has been\
    \ an acceptable solution.  However, in the case of SR\n   traffic, there is assumed\
    \ to be very dynamic traffic demands, and\n   there is considerable risk associated\
    \ with stranding capacity or\n   overbooking service traffic resulting in traffic\
    \ drops.\n   The high-level requirements to consider are:\n   1.  Placement of\
    \ SR LSPs in the same domain as RSVP-TE LSPs must not\n       introduce inaccuracies\
    \ in the TED used by distributed or\n       centralized path computation engines.\n\
    \   2.  Engines that compute RSVP-TE paths may have no knowledge of the\n    \
    \   existence of the SR paths in the same domain.\n   3.  Engines that compute\
    \ RSVP-TE paths should not require a software\n       upgrade or change to their\
    \ path-computation logic.\n   4.  Protocol extensions should be avoided or be\
    \ minimal as, in many\n       cases, this coexistence of RSVP-TE and SR may be\
    \ needed only\n       during a transition phase.\n   5.  Placement of SR LSPs\
    \ in the same domain as RSVP-TE LSPs that are\n       computed in a distributed\
    \ fashion must not require migration to a\n       central controller architecture\
    \ for the RSVP-TE LSPs.\n"

    \ solution options.\n   A specific solution is not recommended as all solutions\
    \ are valid,\n   even though some may not satisfy all the requirements.  If a\
    \ solution\n   is acceptable for an operator based on their deployment model,\
    \ then\n   such a solution can be chosen.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Static Partitioning of Bandwidth
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Static Partitioning of Bandwidth\n   In this model, the static reservable\
    \ bandwidth of an interface can be\n   statically partitioned between SR and RSVP-TE;\
    \ each one can operate\n   within that bandwidth allocation and SHOULD NOT preempt\
    \ the other.\n   While it is possible to configure RSVP-TE to only reserve up\
    \ to a\n   certain maximum link bandwidth and manage the remaining link\n   bandwidth\
    \ for other services, this is a deployment where SR and RSVP-\n   TE are separated\
    \ in the same network (ships in the night) and can\n   lead to suboptimal link\
    \ bandwidth utilization not allowing each to\n   consume more, if required and\
    \ constraining the respective\n   deployments.\n   The downside of this approach\
    \ is the inability to use the reservable\n   bandwidth effectively and the inability\
    \ to use bandwidth left unused\n   by the other protocol.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Centralized Management of Available Capacity
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Centralized Management of Available Capacity\n   In this model, a central\
    \ controller performs path placement for both\n   RSVP-TE and SR LSPs.  The controller\
    \ manages and updates its own view\n   of the in-use and available capacity. \
    \ As the controller is a single\n   common entity managing the network it can\
    \ have a unified and\n   consistent view of the available capacity at all times.\n\
    \   A practical drawback of this model is that it requires the\n   introduction\
    \ of a central controller managing the RSVP-TE LSPs as a\n   prerequisite to the\
    \ deployment of any SR LSPs.  Therefore, this\n   approach is not practical for\
    \ networks where distributed TE with\n   RSVP-TE LSPs is already deployed, as\
    \ it requires a redesign of the\n   network and is not backwards compatible. \
    \ This does not satisfy\n   requirement 5.\n   Note that it is not enough for\
    \ the controller to just maintain the\n   unified view of the available capacity,\
    \ it must also perform the path\n   computation for the RSVP-TE LSPs, as the reservations\
    \ for the SR LSPs\n   are not reflected in the TED.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Flooding SR Utilization in IGP
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Flooding SR Utilization in IGP\n   Using techniques in [RFC7810], [RFC7471],\
    \ and [RFC7823], the SR\n   utilization information can be flooded in IGP-TE,\
    \ and the RSVP-TE\n   path computation engine (Constrained Shortest Path First\
    \ (CSPF)) can\n   be changed to consider this information.  This requires changes\
    \ to\n   the RSVP-TE path computation logic and would require upgrades in\n  \
    \ deployments where distributed computation is done across the network.\n   This\
    \ does not fit with requirements 3 and 4 mentioned earlier.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Running SR over RSVP-TE
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Running SR over RSVP-TE\n   SR can run over dedicated RSVP-TE LSPs that\
    \ carry only SR traffic.\n   In this model, the LSPs can be one-hop or multi-hop\
    \ and can provide\n   bandwidth reservation for the SR traffic based on functionality\
    \ such\n   as auto-bandwidth.  The model of deployment would be similar in\n \
    \  nature to running LDP over RSVP-TE.  This would allow the TED to stay\n   consistent\
    \ across the network and any other RSVP-TE LSPs will also be\n   aware of the\
    \ SR traffic reservations.  In this approach, non-SR\n   traffic MUST NOT take\
    \ the SR-dedicated RSVP-TE LSPs, unless required\n   by policy.\n   The drawback\
    \ of this solution is that it requires SR to rely on RSVP-\n   TE for deployment.\
    \  Furthermore, the accounting accuracy/frequency of\n   this method is dependent\
    \ on performance of auto-bandwidth for RSVP-\n   TE.  Note that, for this method\
    \ to work, the SR-dedicated RSVP-TE\n   LSPs must be set up with the best setup\
    \ and hold priorities in the\n   network.\n"
- title: 3.5.  TED Consistency by Reflecting SR Traffic
  contents:
  - "3.5.  TED Consistency by Reflecting SR Traffic\n   The solution relies on dynamically\
    \ measuring SR traffic utilization\n   on each TE interface and reducing the bandwidth\
    \ allowed for use by\n   RSVP-TE.  It is assumed that SR traffic receives precedence\
    \ in terms\n   of the placement on the path over RSVP traffic (that is, RSVP traffic\n\
    \   can be preempted from the path in case of insufficient resources).\n   This\
    \ is logically equivalent to SR traffic having the best preemption\n   priority\
    \ in the network.  Note that this does not necessarily mean\n   that SR traffic\
    \ has higher QoS priority; in fact, SR and RSVP traffic\n   may be in the same\
    \ QoS class.\n   Reducing the bandwidth allowed for use by RSVP-TE can be explored\n\
    \   using the three parameters available in IGP-TE ([RFC5305] [RFC3630]),\n  \
    \ namely Maximum-Link-Bandwidth, Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth, and\n   Unreserved-Bandwidth.\n\
    \   o  Maximum-Link-Bandwidth: This parameter can be adjusted to\n      accommodate\
    \ the bandwidth required for SR traffic with cascading\n      impacts on Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth\
    \ and Unreserved-Bandwidth.\n      However, changing the maximum bandwidth for\
    \ the TE link will\n      prevent any compute engine for SR or RSVP from determining\
    \ the\n      real static bandwidth of the TE link.  Further, when the Maximum-\n\
    \      Reservable-Bandwidth is derived from the Maximum-Link-Bandwidth,\n    \
    \  its definition changes since Maximum-Link-Bandwidth will account\n      for\
    \ the SR traffic.\n   o  Unreserved-Bandwidth: SR traffic could directly adjust\
    \ the\n      Unreserved-Bandwidth, without impacting Maximum-Link-Bandwidth or\n\
    \      Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth.  This model is equivalent to the\n      option\
    \ described in Section 3.4.  Furthermore this would result in\n      overloading\
    \ IGP-TE advertisements to directly reflect both RSVP-TE\n      bandwidth bookings\
    \ and SR bandwidth measurements.\n   o  Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth: As the preferred\
    \ option, SR traffic\n      could adjust the Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth, with\
    \ cascading\n      impact on the Unreserved-Bandwidth.\n   The following methodology\
    \ can be used at every TE node for this\n   solution, using the following parameters:\n\
    \   o  T: Traffic statistics collection time interval.\n   o  k: The number of\
    \ traffic statistics samples that can provide a\n      smoothing function to the\
    \ statistics collection.  The value of k\n      is a constant integer multiplier\
    \ greater or equal to 1.\n   o  N: Traffic averaging calculation (adjustment)\
    \ interval such that N\n      = k * T.\n   o  Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth: The\
    \ maximum available bandwidth for\n      RSVP-TE.\n   o  If Diffserv-aware MPLS\
    \ Traffic Engineering (DS-TE) [RFC4124] is\n      enabled, the Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth\
    \ SHOULD be interpreted as\n      the aggregate bandwidth constraint across all\
    \ Class-Types\n      independent of the Bandwidth Constraints model.\n   o  Initial\
    \ Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth: The Maximum-reservable-\n      bandwidth for TE\
    \ when no SR traffic or RSVP-TE reservations exist\n      on the interface.\n\
    \   o  RSVP-unreserved-bandwidth-at-priority-X: Maximum-Reservable-\n      Bandwidth\
    \ - sum of (existing reservations at priority X and all\n      priorities better\
    \ than X).\n   o  SR traffic threshold percentage: The percentage difference of\n\
    \      traffic demand that, when exceeded, can result in a change to the\n   \
    \   RSVP-TE Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth.\n   o  IGP-TE update threshold: Specifies\
    \ the frequency at which IGP-TE\n      updates should be triggered based on TE\
    \ bandwidth updates on a\n      link.\n   o  M: An optional multiplier that can\
    \ be applied to the SR traffic\n      average.  This multiplier provides the ability\
    \ to grow or shrink\n      the bandwidth used by SR.  Appendix A offers further\
    \ guidance on\n      M.\n   At every interval T, each node SHOULD collect the\
    \ SR traffic\n   statistics for each of its TE interfaces.  The measured SR traffic\n\
    \   includes all labeled SR traffic and any traffic entering the SR\n   network\
    \ over that TE interface.  Further, at every interval N, given\n   a configured\
    \ SR traffic threshold percentage and a set of collected\n   SR traffic statistics\
    \ samples across the interval N, the SR traffic\n   average (or any other traffic\
    \ metric depending on the algorithm used)\n   over this period is calculated.\
    \  This method of sampling traffic\n   statistics and adjusting bandwidth reservation\
    \ accordingly is similar\n   to how bandwidth gets adjusted for auto-bandwidth\
    \ RSVP-TE LSPs.\n   If the difference between the new calculated SR traffic average\
    \ and\n   the current SR traffic average (that was computed in the prior\n   adjustment)\
    \ is at least SR traffic threshold percentage, then two\n   values MUST be updated:\n\
    \   o  New Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth = Initial Maximum-Reservable-\n      Bandwidth\
    \ - (new SR traffic average * M)\n   o  New RSVP-unreserved-bandwidth-at-priority-X\
    \ = New Maximum-\n      Reservable-Bandwidth - sum of (existing reservations at\
    \ priority X\n      and all priorities better than X)\n   A DS-TE LSR that advertises\
    \ a Bandwidth Constraints TLV should update\n   the bandwidth constraints for\
    \ class-types based on operator policy.\n   For example, when Russian Dolls Model\
    \ (RDM) [RFC4127] is in use, then\n   only BC0 may be updated.  Whereas, when\
    \ Maximum Allocation Model\n   (MAM) [RFC4125] is in use, then all Bandwidth Constraints\
    \ (BCs) may\n   be updated equally such that the total value updated is equal\
    \ to the\n   newly calculated SR traffic average.\n   Note that the computation\
    \ of the new RSVP-unreserved-bandwidth-at-\n   priority-X MAY result in RSVP-TE\
    \ LSPs being hard or soft preempted.\n   Such preemption will be based on relative\
    \ priority (e.g., low to\n   high) between RSVP-TE LSPs.  The IGP-TE update threshold\
    \ SHOULD allow\n   for more frequent flooding of unreserved bandwidth.  From an\n\
    \   operational point of view, an implementation SHOULD be able to expose\n  \
    \ both the configured and the actual values of the Maximum-Reservable-\n   Bandwidth.\n\
    \   If LSP preemption is not acceptable, then the RSVP-TE Maximum-\n   Reservable-Bandwidth\
    \ cannot be reduced below what is currently\n   reserved by RSVP-TE on that interface.\
    \  This may result in bandwidth\n   not being available for SR traffic.  Thus,\
    \ it is required that any\n   external controller managing SR LSPs SHOULD be able\
    \ to detect this\n   situation (for example, by subscribing to TED updates [RFC7752])\
    \ and\n   SHOULD take action to reroute existing SR paths.\n   Generically, SR\
    \ traffic (or any non-RSVP-TE traffic) should have its\n   own priority allocated\
    \ from the available priorities.  This would\n   allow SR to preempt other traffic\
    \ according to the preemption\n   priority order.\n   In this solution, the logic\
    \ to retrieve the statistics, calculating\n   averages and taking action to change\
    \ the Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth\n   is an implementation choice, and all changes\
    \ are local in nature.\n   However, note that this is a new network trigger for\
    \ RSVP-TE\n   preemption and thus is a consideration for the operator.\n   The\
    \ above solution offers the advantage of not introducing new\n   network-wide\
    \ mechanisms especially during scenarios of migrating to\n   SR in an existing\
    \ RSVP-TE network and reusing existing protocol\n   mechanisms.\n"

  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Multiplier Value Range\n   The following is a suggestion for the\
    \ range of values for M:\n   M is a per-node positive real number that ranges\
    \ from 0 to 2 with a\n   default of 1 and may be expressed as a percentage.\n\
    \   o  If M < 1, then the SR traffic average is being understated, which\n   \
    \   can result in the link getting full even though Maximum-\n      Reservable-Bandwidth\
    \ does not reach zero.\n   o  If M > 1, then the SR traffic average is overstated,\
    \ thereby\n      resulting in the Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth reaching zero before\n\
    \      the link gets full.  If the reduction of Maximum-Reservable-\n      Bandwidth\
    \ becomes a negative value, then a value of zero SHOULD be\n      used and advertised.\n"
