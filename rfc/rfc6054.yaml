  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) specification\
    \ [RFC4303]\n   and Authentication Header (AH) [RFC4302] are security protocols\
    \ for\n   IPsec [RFC4301].  Several new AES encryption modes of operation have\n\
    \   been specified for ESP: Counter Mode (CTR) [RFC3686], Galois/Counter\n   Mode\
    \ (GCM) [RFC4106], and Counter with Cipher Block Chaining-Message\n   Authentication\
    \ Code (CBC-MAC) Mode (CCM) [RFC4309]; and one that has\n   been specified for\
    \ both ESP and AH: the Galois Message Authentication\n   Code (GMAC) [RFC4543].\
    \  A Camellia counter mode [RFC5528] and a GOST\n   counter mode [RFC4357] have\
    \ also been specified.  These new modes\n   offer advantages over traditional\
    \ modes of operation.  However, they\n   all have restrictions on their use in\
    \ situations in which multiple\n   senders are protecting traffic using the same\
    \ key.  This document\n   addresses this restriction and describes how these modes\

- title: 2.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "2.  Problem Statement\n   The Counter Mode (CTR) of operation [FIPS.800-38A.2001]\
    \ has become\n   important because of its performance and implementation advantages.\n\
    \   It is the basis for several modes of operation that combine\n   authentication\
    \ with encryption, including CCM and GCM.  All of the\n   counter-based modes\
    \ require that, if a single key is shared by\n   multiple encryption engines,\
    \ those engines must coordinate to ensure\n   that every Initialization Vector\
    \ (IV) used with that key is distinct.\n   That is, for each key, no IV value\
    \ can be used more than once.  This\n   restriction on IV usage is imposed on\
    \ ESP CTR, ESP GCM, and ESP CCM.\n   In cryptographic terms, the IV is a nonce.\
    \  (Note that CBC mode\n   [RFC3602] requires IVs that are unpredictable.  CTR,\
    \ GCM, GMAC, and\n   CCM do not have this restriction.)\n   All ESP and AH transforms\
    \ using a block cipher counter mode have a\n   restriction that an application\
    \ must not use the same key, IV, and\n   Salt values to protect two different\
    \ data payloads.  Notwithstanding\n   this security condition, block cipher counter\
    \ mode transforms are\n   often preferred because of their favorable performance\n\
    \   characteristics as compared to other modes.\n   Each of the block cipher counter\
    \ mode transforms specify the\n   construction of keying material for point-to-point\
    \ applications that\n   are keyed by the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2)\
    \ [RFC5996].\n   The specified constructions guarantee that the security condition\
    \ is\n   not violated by a single sender.  Group applications of IPsec\n   [RFC5374]\
    \ may also find counter mode transforms to be valuable.  Some\n   group applications\
    \ can create an IPsec Security Association (SA) per\n   sender, which meets the\
    \ security condition, and no further\n   specification is required.  However,\
    \ IPsec can be used to protect\n   group applications known as Many-to-Many Applications\
    \ [RFC3170],\n   where a single IPsec SA is used to protect network traffic between\n\
    \   members of a multiple-sender IP multicast application.  Some Many-to-\n  \
    \ Many Applications are comprised of a large number of senders, in\n   which case\
    \ defining an individual IPsec SA for each sender is\n   unmanageable.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  IV Formation for Counter Modes with Group Keys\n   This section specifies\
    \ a particular construction of the IV that\n   enables a group of senders to safely\
    \ share a single IPsec SA.  This\n   construction conforms to the recommendations\
    \ of [RFC5116].  A\n   rationale for this method is given in Appendix A.  In the\n\
    \   construction defined by this specification, each IV is formed by\n   concatenating\
    \ a Sender Identifier (SID) field with a Sender-Specific\n   IV (SSIV) field.\
    \  The value of the SID MUST be unique for each\n   sender, across all of the\
    \ senders sharing a particular Security\n   Association.  The value of the SSIV\
    \ field MUST be unique for each IV\n   constructed by a particular sender for\
    \ use with a particular SA.  The\n   SSIV MAY be chosen in any manner convenient\
    \ to the sender, e.g.,\n   successive values of a counter.  The leftmost bits\

- title: 4.  Group Key Management Conventions
  contents:
  - "4.  Group Key Management Conventions\n   Group applications use a Group Key Management\
    \ System (GKMS) composed\n   of one or more Group Controller and Key Server (GCKS)\
    \ entities\n   [RFC3740].  The GKMS distributes IPsec transform policy and\n \
    \  associated keying material to authorized group members.  This\n   document\
    \ RECOMMENDS that the GKMS both allocate unique SIDs to group\n   members and\
    \ distribute them to group members using a GKM protocol\n   such as GDOI or GSAKMP.\
    \  The strategy used by the GKMS does not need\n   to be mandated in order to\
    \ achieve interoperability; the GKMS is\n   solely responsible for allocating\
    \ SIDs for the group.  Allocating\n   SIDs sequentially is acceptable as long\
    \ as the allocation method\n   follows the requirements in this section.\n   The\
    \ following requirements apply to a GKMS that manages SIDs.  One\n   example of\
    \ such a GKMS is [GDOI-UPDATE].\n   o  For each SA for which sender identifiers\
    \ are used, the GKMS MUST\n      NOT give the same sender identifier to more than\
    \ one active group\n      member.  If the GKMS is uncertain as to the SID associated\
    \ with a\n      group member, it MUST allocate it a new one.  If more than one\n\
    \      entity within the GKMS is distributing sender identifiers, then\n     \
    \ the sets of identifiers distributed by each entity MUST NOT\n      overlap.\n\
    \   o  If the entire set of sender identifiers has been exhausted, the\n     \
    \ GKMS MUST refuse to allow new group members to join.\n      Alternatively, the\
    \ GKMS could distribute replacement ESP or AH\n      Security Associations to\
    \ all group members.  When replacement SAs\n      are distributed, the GKMS could\
    \ also distribute larger SID values\n      so that more senders can be accommodated.\n\
    \   o  The GKMS SHOULD allocate a single sender identifier for each group\n  \
    \    member, and issue this value to the sender for all group SAs for\n      which\
    \ that member is a sender.  This strategy enables both the\n      GKMS and the\
    \ senders to avoid managing SIDs on a per-SA basis.  It\n      also simplifies\
    \ the rekeying process, since SIDs do not need to be\n      changed or re-issued\
    \ along with replacement SAs during a rekey\n      event.\n   o  When a GKMS determines\
    \ that a particular group member is no longer\n      a part of the group, then\
    \ it MAY re-allocate any sender identifier\n      associated with that group member\
    \ for use with a new group member.\n      In this case, the GKMS MUST first delete\
    \ and replace any active AH\n      or ESP SAs with which the SID may have been\
    \ used.  This is\n      necessary to avoid re-use of an IV with the cipher key\
    \ associated\n      with the SA.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This specification provides a method for securely\
    \ using cryptographic\n   algorithms that require a unique IV, such as a block\
    \ cipher mode of\n   operation based on counter mode, in a scenario in which there\
    \ are\n   multiple cryptographic devices that each generate IVs.  This is done\n\
    \   by partitioning the set of possible IV values such that each\n   cryptographic\
    \ device has exclusive use of a set of IV values.  When\n   the recommendations\
    \ in this specification are followed, the security\n   of the cryptographic algorithms\
    \ is equivalent to the conventional\n   case in which there is a single sender.\
    \  Unlike CBC mode, CTR, GCM,\n   GMAC, and CCM do not require IVs that are unpredictable.\n\
    \   The security of a group depends upon the correct operation of the\n   group\
    \ members.  Any group member using an SID not allocated to it may\n   reduce the\
    \ security of the system.\n   As is the case with a single sender, a cryptographic\
    \ device storing\n   keying material over a reboot is responsible for storing\
    \ a counter\n   value such that upon resumption it never re-uses counters.  In\
    \ the\n   context of this specification, the cryptographic device would need to\n\
    \   store both SID and SSIV values used with a particular IPsec SA in\n   addition\
    \ to policy associated with the IPsec SA.\n   A group member that reaches the\
    \ end of its IV space MUST stop sending\n   data traffic on that SA.  This can\
    \ happen if the group member does\n   not notify the GKMS in time for the GKMS\
    \ to remedy the problem (e.g.,\n   to provide the group member with a new SID\
    \ or to provide a new SA),\n   or if the GKMS ignores the notification for some\
    \ reason.  In this\n   case, the group member should re-register with the GCKS\
    \ and expect to\n   receive the SAs that it needs to continue participating in\
    \ the group.\n   This specification does not address virtual machine rollbacks\
    \ that\n   may cause the cryptographic device to re-use nonce values.\n   Other\
    \ security considerations applying to IPsec SAs with multiple\n   senders are\
    \ described in [RFC5374].\n"

  - "Appendix A.  Rationale for the IV Formation for Counter Modes with Group\n  \
    \           Keys\n   The two main alternatives for ensuring the uniqueness of\
    \ IVs in a\n   multi-sender environment are to have each sender include a Sender\n\
    \   Identifier (SID) value in either the Salt value or in the explicit IV\n  \
    \ field (recall that the IV used as input to the crypto algorithm is\n   constructed\
    \ by concatenating the Salt and the explicit IV).  The\n   explicit IV field was\
    \ chosen as the location for the SID because it\n   is explicitly present in the\
    \ packet.  If the SID had been included in\n   the Salt, then a receiver would\
    \ need to infer the SID value for a\n   particular AH or ESP packet by recognizing\
    \ which sender had sent that\n   packet.  This inference could be made on the\
    \ IP source address, if AH\n   or ESP is transported directly over IP.  However,\
    \ if an alternate\n   transport mechanism such as UDP is being used [RFC3948]\
    \ (e.g., for\n   NAT traversal), the method used to infer the sender would need\
    \ to\n   take that mechanism into account.  It is simpler to use the explicit\n\
    \   IV field, and thus avoid the need to infer the sender from the packet\n  \
    \ at all.\n   The normative requirement that all of the SID values used with a\n\
    \   particular Security Association must have the same length is not\n   strictly\
    \ necessary, but was added to promote simplicity of\n   implementation.  Alternatively,\
    \ it would be acceptable to have the\n   SID values be chosen to be the codewords\
    \ of a variable-length\n   prefix-free code.  This approach preserves security\
    \ since the\n   distinctness of the IVs follows from the fact that no SID is a\
    \ prefix\n   of another; thus, any pair of IVs has a subset of bits that are\n\
    \   distinct.  If a Huffman code [H52] is used to form the SIDs, then a\n   set\

    \ maximized for a given distribution of SID lengths.\n   Additionally, there are\
    \ simple methods for generating efficient\n   prefix-free codes whose codewords\
    \ are octet strings.  Nevertheless,\n   these methods were disallowed in order\

  - "Appendix B.  Example\n   This section provides an example of SID allocation and\
    \ IV generation,\n   as defined in this document.  A GCKS administrator determines\
    \ that\n   the group has one SA that is shared by all senders.  The algorithm\n\
    \   for the SA is AES-GCM using an SID of size 8 bits.\n   When the first sender\
    \ registers with the GCKS, it is allocated SID 1.\n   The sender subsequently\
    \ sends AES-GCM encrypted packets with the\n   following IVs (shown in network\
    \ byte order): 0x0100000000000001,\n   0x0100000000000002, 0x0100000000000003,\
    \ ... with a final value of\n   0x01FFFFFFFFFFFFFF.  The second sender registering\
    \ with the GCKS is\n   allocated SID 2, and begins sending packets with the following\
    \ IVs:\n   0x0200000000000001, 0x0200000000000002, 0x0200000000000003, ... with\n\
    \   a final value of 0x02FFFFFFFFFFFFFF.\n   According to group policy, the GCKS\
    \ may later distribute policy and\n   keying material for a replacement SA.  When\
    \ group senders begin\n   sending AES-GCM packets encrypted with the new SA, each\
    \ sender\n   continues to use the SID value previously allocated to it.  For\n\
    \   example, the sender allocated SID 2 would be sending on a new SA with\n  \
    \ IV values of 0x0200000000000001, 0x0200000000000002,\n   0x0200000000000003,\
    \ ... with a final value of 0x02FFFFFFFFFFFFFF.\n"
