  - "1.  Introduction\n   DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation [RFC3633] allows a client to include\
    \ a\n   prefix-length hint value in the message sent to the server to\n   indicate\
    \ a preference for the size of the prefix to be delegated.  A\n   prefix-length\
    \ hint is communicated by a client to the server by\n   including an IA_PD Prefix\
    \ Option (IAPREFIX option), encapsulated in\n   an IA_PD option, with the \"IPv6\
    \ prefix\" field set to zero and the\n   \"prefix-length\" field set to a non-zero\
    \ value.  The servers are free\n   to ignore the prefix-length hint values depending\
    \ on server policy.\n   However, some clients may not be able to function (or\
    \ only in a\n   degraded state) when they're provided with a prefix whose length\
    \ is\n   different from what they requested.  For example, if the client is\n\
    \   asking for a /56 and the server returns a /64, the functionality of\n   the\
    \ client might be limited because it might not be able to split the\n   prefix\
    \ for all its interfaces.  For other hints, such as requesting\n   for an explicit\
    \ address, this might be less critical, as it just\n   helps a client that wishes\
    \ to continue using what it used last time.\n   The prefix-length hint directly\
    \ impacts the operational capability of\n   the client; thus, it should be given\
    \ more consideration.\n   [RFC3633] is unclear about how the client and server\
    \ should act in\n   different situations involving the prefix-length hint.  From\
    \ the\n   client perspective, it should be able to use the prefix-length hint\n\
    \   to signal to the server its real-time need and should be able to\n   handle\
    \ prefixes with lengths different from the prefix-length hint.\n   This document\
    \ provides guidance on what a client should do in\n   different situations to\
    \ help it operate properly.  From the server\n   perspective, the server is free\
    \ to ignore the prefix-length hints\n   depending on server policy; however, in\
    \ cases where the server has a\n   policy for considering the hint, this document\
    \ provides guidance on\n   how the prefix-length hint should be handled by the\
    \ server in\n   different situations.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Creation of Solicit Message
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Creation of Solicit Message\n   Problem:\n   The Solicit message allows\
    \ a client to ask servers for prefixes and\n   other configuration parameters.\
    \  The client might want a different\n   prefix length due to configuration changes,\
    \ or it might just want the\n   same prefix again after reboot.  The client might\
    \ also prefer a\n   prefix of a specific length in case the requested prefix is\
    \ not\n   available.  The server could decide whether to provide the client\n\
    \   with the preferred prefix depending on server policy, but the client\n   should\
    \ be able to signal to the server its real-time need.\n   The server usually has\
    \ a record of the prefix it gave to the client\n   during its most recent interaction.\
    \  The best way to assure a\n   completely new delegated prefix is to send a new\
    \ IAID (Identity\n   Association IDentifier) in the IA_PD (Identity Association\
    \ for Prefix\n   Delegation).  However, this would require the client device to\
    \ have\n   persistent storage, because rebooting the device would cause the\n\
    \   client to use the original IAID in the IA_PD.\n   Solution:\n   When the client\
    \ prefers a prefix of a specific length from the\n   server, the client MUST send\
    \ a Solicit message using the same IAID in\n   the IA_PD, include the preferred\
    \ prefix-length value in the \"prefix-\n   length\" field of the IAPREFIX option,\
    \ and set the \"IPv6 prefix\" field\n   to zero.  This is an indication to the\
    \ server that the client prefers\n   a prefix of the specified length, regardless\
    \ of what it received\n   before.\n   When the client wants the same prefix back\
    \ from the server, it MUST\n   send a Solicit message using the same IAID in the\
    \ IA_PD, include the\n   previously delegated prefix value in the \"IPv6 prefix\"\
    \ field of the\n   IAPREFIX option, and include the length of the prefix in the\
    \ \"prefix-\n   length\" field.  This is an indication to the server that the\
    \ client\n   wants the same prefix back.\n   When the client wants the same prefix\
    \ back from the server and would\n   prefer to accept a prefix of a specified\
    \ length in case the requested\n   prefix is not available, the client MUST send\
    \ a Solicit message using\n   the same IAID in the IA_PD, include the previously\
    \ delegated prefix\n   in one IAPREFIX option, and include the prefix-length hint\
    \ in another\n   IAPREFIX option.  There is no requirement regarding the order\
    \ of the\n   two IAPREFIX options.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Receipt of Solicit Message
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Receipt of Solicit Message\n   Problem:\n   [RFC3633] allows a client to\
    \ include a prefix-length hint in the\n   Solicit message to signal its preference\
    \ to the server.  How the\n   prefix-length hint should be handled by the server\
    \ is unclear.  The\n   client might want a different prefix length due to configuration\n\
    \   changes or it might just want the same prefix again after reboot.\n   The\
    \ server should interpret these cases differently.\n   Many servers are configured\
    \ to provide only prefixes of specific\n   lengths to the client, for example,\
    \ if the client requested for a /54\n   but the server could only provide /30,\
    \ /48, and /56.  How should\n   these servers decide which prefix to give to the\
    \ client based on the\n   prefix-length hint?\n   Solution:\n   Upon the receipt\
    \ of Solicit message, if the client included only a\n   prefix-length hint in\
    \ the message, the server SHOULD first check its\n   prefix pool for a prefix\
    \ with a length matching the prefix-length\n   hint value, regardless of the prefix\
    \ record from previous\n   interactions with the client.  If the server does not\
    \ have a prefix\n   with a length matching the prefix-length hint value, then\
    \ the server\n   SHOULD provide the prefix whose length is shorter and closest\
    \ to the\n   prefix-length hint value.\n   If the client included a specific prefix\
    \ value in the Solicit\n   message, the server SHOULD check its prefix pool for\
    \ a prefix\n   matching the requested prefix value.  If the requested prefix is\
    \ not\n   available in the server's prefix pool, and the client also included\
    \ a\n   prefix-length hint in the same IA_PD option, then the server SHOULD\n\
    \   check its prefix pool for a prefix with a length matching the prefix-\n  \
    \ length hint value.  If the server does not have a prefix with a\n   length matching\
    \ the prefix-length hint value, the server SHOULD\n   provide the prefix whose\
    \ length is shorter and closest to the prefix-\n   length hint value.\n   If the\
    \ server will not assign any prefixes to any IA_PDs in a\n   subsequent Request\
    \ from the client, the server MUST send an Advertise\n   message to the client\
    \ as described in Section 11.2 of [RFC3633].\n"
- title: 3.3.  Receipt of Advertise Message
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Receipt of Advertise Message\n   Problem:\n   The server might not be able\
    \ to honor the prefix-length hint due to\n   server policy or lack of resources\
    \ in its prefix pool.  If the prefix\n   length provided by the server in the\
    \ Advertise message is different\n   from what the client requested in the Solicit\
    \ message, the question\n   would be whether the client should use the provided\
    \ prefix length or\n   continue to ask for its preferred prefix length.  There\
    \ are certain\n   situations in which the client could not operate properly if\
    \ it used\n   a prefix whose length is different from what it requested in the\n\
    \   prefix-length hint.  However, if the client ignores the Advertise\n   messages\
    \ and continues to solicit for the preferred prefix length,\n   the client might\
    \ be stuck in the DHCP process.  Another question is\n   whether the client should\
    \ ignore other configuration parameters such\n   as available addresses.\n   Solution:\n\
    \   If the client could use the prefixes included in the Advertise\n   messages\
    \ despite being different from the prefix-length hint, the\n   client SHOULD choose\
    \ the shortest prefix length that is closest to\n   the prefix-length hint.  The\
    \ client SHOULD continue requesting the\n   preferred prefix in the subsequent\
    \ DHCPv6 messages as defined in\n   Section 3.4 of this document.\n   If the client\
    \ sent a Solicit with only IA_PDs and cannot use the\n   prefixes included in\
    \ the Advertise messages, it MUST ignore the\n   Advertise messages and continue\
    \ to send Solicit messages until it\n   gets the preferred prefix.  To avoid traffic\
    \ congestion, the client\n   MUST send Solicit messages at defined intervals,\
    \ as specified in\n   [RFC7083].\n   If the client also solicited for other stateful\
    \ configuration options\n   such as IA_NAs and the client cannot use the prefixes\
    \ included in the\n   Advertise messages, the client SHOULD accept the other stateful\n\
    \   configuration options and continue to request the desired IA_PD\n   prefix\
    \ in subsequent DHCPv6 messages as specified in [RFC7550].\n"
- title: 3.4.  Creation of Renew/Rebind Message
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Creation of Renew/Rebind Message\n   Problem:\n   Servers might not be\
    \ able to provide a prefix with the length equal\n   to or shorter than the prefix-length\
    \ hint.  If the client decided to\n   use the prefix provided by the server despite\
    \ it being longer than\n   the prefix-length hint but would still prefer the prefix-length\
    \ hint\n   originally requested in the Solicit message, there should be some way\n\
    \   for the client to express this preference during Renew/Rebind.  For\n   example,\
    \ if the client requested for a /60 but got a /64, the client\n   should be able\
    \ to signal to the server during Renew/Rebind that it\n   would still prefer a\
    \ /60.  This is to see whether the server has the\n   prefix preferred by the\
    \ client available in its prefix pool during\n   Renew/Rebind.  [RFC3633] is not\
    \ completely clear on whether the\n   client is allowed to include a prefix-length\
    \ hint in the Renew/Rebind\n   message.\n   Solution:\n   During Renew/Rebind,\
    \ if the client prefers a prefix length that is\n   different from the prefix\
    \ it is currently using, then the client\n   SHOULD send the Renew/Rebind message\
    \ with the same IA_PD, and include\n   two IAPREFIX options, one containing the\
    \ currently delegated prefix\n   and the other containing the prefix-length hint.\
    \  This is to extend\n   the lifetime of the prefix the client is currently using,\
    \ get the\n   prefix the client prefers, and go through a graceful switch over.\n\
    \   If the server is unable to provide the client with the newly\n   requested\
    \ prefix, but is able to extend lifetime of the old prefix,\n   the client SHOULD\
    \ continue using the old prefix.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Receipt of Renew/Rebind Message
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Receipt of Renew/Rebind Message\n   Problem:\n   The prefix preferred by\
    \ the client might become available in the\n   server's prefix pool during Renew/Rebind,\
    \ even though it was\n   unavailable during Solicit.  This might be due to a server\n\
    \   configuration change or because some other client stopped using the\n   prefix.\n\
    \   The question is whether the server should remember the prefix-length\n   hint\
    \ the client originally included in the Solicit message and check\n   it during\
    \ Renew/Rebind to see if it has the prefix length the client\n   preferred.  This\
    \ would require the server to keep extra information\n   about the client.  There\
    \ is also the possibility that the client's\n   preference for the prefix length\
    \ might have changed during this time\n   interval, so the prefix-length hint\
    \ remembered by the server might\n   not be what the client prefers during Renew/Rebind.\n\
    \   Instead of having the server remember the prefix-length hint of the\n   client,\
    \ another option is for the client to include the prefix-length\n   hint in the\
    \ Renew/Rebind message.  [RFC3633] is unclear about what\n   the server should\
    \ do if the client also included a prefix-length hint\n   value in the Renew/Rebind\
    \ message and whether the server could\n   provide a different prefix to the client\
    \ during Renew/Rebind.\n   Solution:\n   Upon the receipt of a Renew/Rebind message,\
    \ if the client included in\n   the IA_PD both an IAPREFIX option with the delegated\
    \ prefix value and\n   an IAPREFIX option with a prefix-length hint value, the\
    \ server SHOULD\n   check whether it could extend the lifetime of the original\
    \ delegated\n   prefix and whether it has any available prefix matching the prefix-\n\
    \   length hint (or determine the closest possible to the prefix-length\n   hint)\
    \ within its limit.\n   If the server assigned the prefix included in IA_PD to\
    \ the client,\n   the server SHOULD do one of the following, depending on its\
    \ policy:\n   1. Extend the lifetime of the original delegated prefix.\n   2.\
    \ Extend the lifetime of the original delegated prefix and assign a\n      new\
    \ prefix of the requested length.\n   3. Mark the original delegated prefix as\
    \ invalid by giving it 0\n      lifetimes, and assign a new prefix of the requested\
    \ length.  This\n      avoids the complexity of handling multiple delegated prefixes\
    \ but\n      may break all the existing connections of the client.\n   4. Assign\
    \ the original delegated prefix with 0 preferred-lifetime, a\n      specific non-zero\
    \ valid-lifetime depending on actual requirement,\n      and assign a new prefix\
    \ of the requested length.  This allows the\n      client to finish up existing\
    \ connections with the original prefix\n      and use the new prefix to establish\
    \ new connections.\n   5. Do not include the original delegated prefix in the\
    \ Reply message,\n      and assign a new prefix of the requested length.  The\
    \ original\n      prefix would be valid until its lifetime expires.  This avoids\n\
    \      sudden renumbering on the client.\n   If the server does not know the client's\
    \ bindings (e.g., a different\n   server receiving the message during Rebind),\
    \ then the server SHOULD\n   ignore the original delegated prefix and try to assign\
    \ a new prefix\n   of the requested length.\n   It's unnecessary for the server\
    \ to remember the prefix-length hint\n   the client requested during Solicit.\
    \  It is possible that the\n   client's preference for the prefix length might\
    \ have changed during\n   this time interval, so the prefix-length hint in the\
    \ Renew message is\n   reflecting what the client prefers at the time.\n"
- title: 3.6.  General Recommendation
  contents:
  - "3.6.  General Recommendation\n   The recommendation to address the issues discussed\
    \ in this document\n   is for a client that wants (at least) to have a delegated\
    \ prefix of a\n   specific prefix length to always include an IAPREFIX option\
    \ with just\n   the prefix-length hint in addition to any IAPREFIX options it\
    \ has\n   included for each IA_PD in any Solicit, Request, Renew, and Rebind\n\
    \   messages it sends.  While a server is free to ignore the hint,\n   servers\
    \ that do not choose to ignore the hint should attempt to\n   assign a prefix\
    \ of the hint length (or assign the next closest length\n   that does not exceed\
    \ the hint) if one is available.  Whether a server\n   favors the hint or avoiding\
    \ a renumbering event is a matter of server\n   policy.\n"
