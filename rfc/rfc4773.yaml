  contents:
  - "2.  IANA IPv6 Special Purpose Address Block\n   [RFC2928] specified the assignment\
    \ of the IPv6 address prefix to\n   IANA.  The rationale for this allocation is:\n\
    \      \"The block of Sub-TLA IDs assigned to the IANA (i.e., 2001:\n      0000::/29\
    \ - 2001:01F8::/29) is for assignment for testing and\n      experimental usage\
    \ to support activities such as the 6bone, and\n      for new approaches like\
    \ exchanges.\"  [RFC2928]\n   This address allocation to IANA was intended to\
    \ support testing and\n   experimental activities.  A more general view of the\
    \ roles of IANA\n   with respect to address allocation functions is documented\
    \ in\n   [RFC2860]:\n      \"4.3. [...]  Note that [...] (b) assignments of specialised\n\
    \      address blocks (such as multicast or anycast blocks), and (c)\n      experimental\
    \ assignments are not considered to be policy issues,\n      and shall remain\
    \ subject to the provisions of this Section 4.\n      (For purposes of this MOU,\
    \ the term \"assignments\" includes\n      allocations.)\"  [RFC2860]\n   The\
    \ reference to section 4 here is to the general technical work for\n   the IANA:\n\
    \      \"4.1.  The IANA will assign and register Internet protocol\n      parameters\
    \ only as directed by the criteria and procedures\n      specified in RFCs, including\
    \ Proposed, Draft, and full Internet\n      Standards and Best Current Practice\
    \ documents, and any other RFC\n      that calls for IANA assignment.\"  [RFC2860]\n\
    \   This document directs IANA to undertake designation of special\n   purpose\
    \ address blocks within the purview of direct assignments by\n   the IANA under\
    \ the terms of the assignment criteria specified in RFC\n   2928.\n   This document\
    \ directs IANA to open a Special Purpose IPv6 address\n   registry for the management\
    \ of these IANA-designated address blocks.\n   Special Purpose registrations to\
    \ be made from this registry include\n   addresses for experimental purposes,\
    \ as described in [RFC2928], and\n   other special purpose cases, as documented\
    \ in IESG-reviewed published\n   RFCs, according to the provisions described in\
    \ section 4.1 of\n   [RFC2860].\n"
- title: 3.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA maintains an \"IANA IPv6 Address Special Purpose\
    \ Registry\".  The\n   registry records current IANA address designations from\
    \ the IANA-\n   managed Special Purpose IPv6 address pool.\n   This recommendation\
    \ concerns the management of the address pool\n   assigned by the IETF to the\
    \ IANA in July 1999 by [RFC2928], namely\n   2001:0000::/23.  Following the policies\
    \ outlined in [RFC2434],\n   further assignments of address space to IANA for\
    \ subsequent\n   designation of address prefixes for the purposes listed here\
    \ shall be\n   undertaken only through an IETF Consensus action.  Such directions\n\
    \   for assignments of address space to augment the IANA-managed special\n   purpose\
    \ address pool should, in the general course of events, be\n   consistent with\
    \ prevailing IANA IPv6 address management policies\n   [IPv6-Policies].\n   IANA\
    \ may undertake IPv6 address designations in support of special\n   purposes as\
    \ requested in \"IANA Considerations\" sections in IESG-\n   reviewed RFCs, where\
    \ an address is requested with an intended use of\n   the designated address block\
    \ for the purpose of testing or\n   experimental usage activities initiated by\
    \ IETF, or for specialised\n   use of the address block in a context (e.g., anycast)\
    \ associated with\n   an Internet Standards track protocol.\n   The IANA IPv6\
    \ Special Purpose Address Registry records, for all\n   current address designations\
    \ undertaken by IANA:\n   1.  The designated address prefix.\n   2.  The RFC that\
    \ called for the IANA address designation.\n   3.  The date the designation was\
    \ made.\n   4.  The date the use designation is to be terminated (if specified\
    \ as\n       a limited-use designation).\n   5.  The nature of the purpose of\
    \ the designated address (e.g.,\n       unicast experiment or protocol service\
    \ anycast).\n   6.  For experimental unicast applications and otherwise as\n \
    \      appropriate, the registry will also identify the entity and\n       related\
    \ contact details to whom the address designation has been\n       made.\n   7.\
    \  The registry will also note, for each designation, the intended\n       routing\
    \ scope of the address, indicating whether the address is\n       intended to\
    \ be routable only in scoped, local, or private\n       contexts, or whether the\
    \ address prefix is intended to be routed\n       globally.\n   8.  The date in\
    \ the IANA registry is the date of the IANA action,\n       i.e., the day IANA\
    \ records the allocation.\n   The IANA registry notes, as a general comment, that\
    \ address prefixes\n   listed in the Special Purpose Address Registry are not\
    \ guaranteed\n   routability in any particular local or global context.\n   IANA\
    \ will not maintain further sub-registries for any special purpose\n   address\
    \ block designated according to this direction.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Security of the Internet's routing system relies\
    \ on the ability to\n   authenticate an assertion of unique control of an address\
    \ block.\n   Measures to authenticate such assertions rely on validation that\
    \ the\n   address block forms part of an existing allocated address block, and\n\
    \   that there is a trustable and unique reference in the IANA address\n   registries.\n\
    \   The proposed registry is intended to provide an authoritative source\n   of\
    \ information regarding the currency and intended purpose of special\n   use IPv6\
    \ address blocks that are designated from the IANA-\n   administered Special Use\
    \ registry.  This is a small step towards the\n   creation of a comprehensive\
    \ registry framework that can be used as a\n   trust point for commencing a chain\
    \ of address validation.\n   Consideration should be given to IANA registry publication\
    \ formats\n   that are machine parseable, and also the use of file signatures\
    \ and\n   associated certificate mechanisms to allow applications to confirm\n\
    \   that the registry contents are current, and that they have been\n   published\
    \ by the IANA.\n"
