  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The IPsec series of protocols makes use of various cryptographic\n\
    \   algorithms in order to provide security services.  The Internet Key\n   Exchange\
    \ (IKE (RFC 2409) and IKEv2) provide a mechanism to negotiate\n   which algorithms\
    \ should be used in any given association.  However,\n   to ensure interoperability\
    \ between disparate implementations, it is\n   necessary to specify a set of mandatory-to-implement\
    \ algorithms to\n   ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations\n\
    \   will have available.  This document defines the current set of\n   algorithms\
    \ that are mandatory to implement as part of IKEv2, as well\n   as algorithms\
    \ that should be implemented because they may be promoted\n   to mandatory at\
    \ some future time.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Key Exchange protocol provides for the negotiation\
    \ of\n   cryptographic algorithms between both endpoints of a cryptographic\n\
    \   association.  Different implementations of IPsec and IKE may provide\n   different\
    \ algorithms.  However, the IETF desires that all\n   implementations should have\
    \ some way to interoperate.  In particular,\n   this requires that IKE define\
    \ a set of mandatory-to-implement\n   algorithms because IKE itself uses such\
    \ algorithms as part of its own\n   negotiations.  This requires that some set\
    \ of algorithms be specified\n   as \"mandatory-to-implement\" for IKE.\n   The\
    \ nature of cryptography is that new algorithms surface\n   continuously and existing\
    \ algorithms are continuously attacked.  An\n   algorithm believed to be strong\
    \ today may be demonstrated to be weak\n   tomorrow.  Given this, the choice of\
    \ mandatory-to-implement algorithm\n   should be conservative so as to minimize\
    \ the likelihood of it being\n   compromised quickly.  Thought should also be\
    \ given to performance\n   considerations as many uses of IPsec will be in environments\
    \ where\n   performance is a concern.\n   Finally, we need to recognize that the\
    \ mandatory-to-implement\n   algorithm(s) may need to change over time to adapt\
    \ to the changing\n   world.  For this reason, the selection of mandatory-to-implement\n\
    \   algorithms was removed from the main IKEv2 specification and placed\n   in\
    \ this document.  As the choice of algorithm changes, only this\n   document should\
    \ need to be updated.\n   Ideally, the mandatory-to-implement algorithm of tomorrow\
    \ should\n   already be available in most implementations of IPsec by the time\
    \ it\n   is made mandatory.  To facilitate this, we will attempt to identify\n\
    \   those algorithms (that are known today) in this document.  There is\n   no\
    \ guarantee that the algorithms we believe today may be mandatory in\n   the future\
    \ will in fact become so.  All algorithms known today are\n   subject to cryptographic\
    \ attack and may be broken in the future.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements Terminology\n   Keywords \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", and\n   \"MAY\" that appear in this document are\
    \ to be interpreted as described\n   in [RFC2119].\n   We define some additional\
    \ terms here:\n   SHOULD+    This term means the same as SHOULD.  However, it\
    \ is likely\n              that an algorithm marked as SHOULD+ will be promoted\
    \ at\n              some future time to be a MUST.\n   SHOULD-    This term means\
    \ the same as SHOULD.  However, an algorithm\n              marked as SHOULD-\
    \ may be deprecated to a MAY in a future\n              version of this document.\n\
    \   MUST-      This term means the same as MUST.  However, we expect at\n    \
    \          some point that this algorithm will no longer be a MUST in\n      \
    \        a future document.  Although its status will be determined\n        \
    \      at a later time, it is reasonable to expect that if a\n              future\
    \ revision of a document alters the status of a MUST-\n              algorithm,\
    \ it will remain at least a SHOULD or a SHOULD-.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The security of cryptographic-based systems depends\
    \ on both the\n   strength of the cryptographic algorithms chosen and the strength\
    \ of\n   the keys used with those algorithms.  The security also depends on\n\
    \   the engineering of the protocol used by the system to ensure that\n   there\
    \ are no non-cryptographic ways to bypass the security of the\n   overall system.\n\
    \   This document concerns itself with the selection of cryptographic\n   algorithms\
    \ for the use of IKEv2, specifically with the selection of\n   \"mandatory-to-implement\"\
    \ algorithms.  The algorithms identified in\n   this document as \"MUST implement\"\
    \ or \"SHOULD implement\" are not known\n   to be broken at the current time,\
    \ and cryptographic research so far\n   leads us to believe that they will likely\
    \ remain secure into the\n   foreseeable future.  However, this isn't necessarily\
