  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Service Record (SRV) [RFC2782] identifies the host(s)\
    \ that will\n   support particular services.  The DNS is queried for SRV RR in\
    \ the\n   general form:\n   _Service._Proto.Name\n      Service: the symbolic\
    \ name of the desired service\n      Proto: the protocol of the desired service\n\
    \      Name: the domain name for which this record is valid\n   \"Address Resolution\
    \ for Instant Messaging and Presence\" [RFC3861]\n   provides guidance for locating\
    \ the services associated with URIs that\n   employ the following two URI schemes\
    \ [RFC3986]: 'im' for INSTANT\n   INBOXes [RFC3860] and 'pres' for PRESENTITIES\
    \ [RFC3859].\n   In order to ensure that the association between \"_im\" and \"\
    _pres\" and\n   their respective underlying services are deterministic, the IANA\
    \ has\n   created two independent registries: the Instant Messaging SRV\n   Protocol\
    \ Label registry and the Presence SRV Protocol Label registry.\n   This document\
    \ defines and registers the \"_sip\" protocol label in both\n   registries so\
    \ that computer programs can resolve 'im:' and 'pres:'\n   URIs down to SIP addresses.\n\
    \   Moreover, this document explains how the use of SIP for Presence and\n   Instant\
    \ Messaging uses SRV.\n"

- title: 3.  DNS SRV Usage of SIP with 'im' and 'pres' URIs
  contents:
  - "3.  DNS SRV Usage of SIP with 'im' and 'pres' URIs\n   Although there are standard\
    \ procedures for resolving 'im' and 'pres'\n   URIs (Section 3 of [RFC3861]),\
    \ the labels for SIP are not registered.\n   Section 5 of [RFC3428] states that\
    \ if a user agent (UA) is presented\n   with an IM URI (e.g., \"im:fred@example.com\"\
    ) as the address for an\n   instant message, it SHOULD resolve it to a SIP URI,\
    \ and place the\n   resulting URI in the Request-URI of the MESSAGE request before\n\
    \   sending.\n   Following the procedures defined in [RFC3861], in order to resolve\n\
    \   the IM URI, the UA performs a SRV lookup for:\n   _im._sip.example.com\n \
    \  Assuming that the example.com domain offers a SIP service for instant\n   messaging\
    \ at simple.example.com, this will result in a resolution of\n   _im._sip.example.com.\
    \ to simple.example.com.  Thus, the instant\n   messaging URI im:fred@example.com\
    \ would resolve to a SIP URI of\n   sip:fred@simple.example.com.\n   SIP supports\
    \ both pager [RFC3428] and session [RFC4975] IM mode.\n   However, a DNS SRV lookup\
    \ does not specify which SIP IM mode a domain\n   offer.  If the user agent client\
    \ (UAC) supports both session mode and\n   pager mode, it is then suggested to\
    \ try session mode first; if that\n   mode is rejected, the UAC has to be ready\
    \ to fall back to pager mode.\n   Section 5 of [RFC3856] states that procedures\
    \ defined in [RFC3861]\n   are also used to resolve the protocol-independent PRES\
    \ URI for a\n   presentity (e.g., \"pres:fred@example.com\") into a SIP URI.\n\
    \   Following the procedures defined in [RFC3861], in order to resolve\n   the\
    \ PRES URI, the UA performs a SRV lookup for:\n   _pres._sip.example.com\n   Assuming\
    \ that the example.com domain offers a SIP presence service at\n   simple.example.com,\
    \ this will result in a resolution of\n   _pres._sip.example.com. to simple.example.com.\
    \  Thus, the protocol-\n   independent PRES URI pres:fred@example.com would resolve\
    \ to a SIP URI\n   of sip:fred@simple.example.com.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document merely serves for the registration\
    \ of DNS SRV labels in\n   the appropriate IANA registry.  The document does not\
    \ specify a\n   protocol; therefore, there are no security issues associated with\
    \ it.\n"
