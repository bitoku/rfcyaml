  - "Abstract\n   This document defines an extension for the Simple Mail Transfer\n
    \  Protocol (SMTP) called \"RRVS\" to provide a method for senders to\n   indicate
    to receivers a point in time when the ownership of the\n   target mailbox was
    known to the sender.  This can be used to detect\n   changes of mailbox ownership
    and thus prevent mail from being\n   delivered to the wrong party.  This document
    also defines a header\n   field called \"Require-Recipient-Valid-Since\" that
    can be used to\n   tunnel the request through servers that do not support the
    extension.\n   The intended use of these facilities is on automatically generated\n
    \  messages, such as account statements or password change instructions,\n   that
    might contain sensitive information, though it may also be\n   useful in other
    applications.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Email addresses sometimes get reassigned to a different
    person.  For\n   example, employment changes at a company can cause an address
    used\n   for an ex-employee to be assigned to a new employee, or a mail\n   service
    provider (MSP) might expire an account and then let someone\n   else register
    for the local-part that was previously used.  Those who\n   sent mail to the previous
    owner of an address might not know that it\n   has been reassigned.  This can
    lead to the sending of email to the\n   correct address but the wrong recipient.
    \ This situation is of\n   particular concern with transactional mail related
    to purchases,\n   online accounts, and the like.\n   What is needed is a way to
    indicate an attribute of the recipient\n   that will distinguish between the previous
    owner of an address and\n   its current owner, if they are different.  Further,
    this needs to be\n   done in a way that respects privacy.\n   The mechanisms specified
    here allow the sender of the mail to\n   indicate how \"old\" the address assignment
    is expected to be.  In\n   effect, the sender is saying, \"I know that the intended
    recipient was\n   using this address at this point in time.  I don't want this
    message\n   delivered to anyone else\".  A receiving system can then compare this\n
    \  information against the point in time at which the address was\n   assigned
    to its current user.  If the assignment was made later than\n   the point in time
    indicated in the message, there is a good chance\n   the current user of the address
    is not the correct recipient.  The\n   receiving system can then prevent delivery
    and, preferably, notify\n   the original sender of the problem.\n   The primary
    application is transactional mail (such as account\n   information, password change
    requests, and other automatically\n   generated messages) rather than user-authored
    content.  However, it\n   may be useful in other contexts; for example, a personal
    address book\n   could record the time an email address was added to it, and thus
    use\n   that time with this extension.\n   Because the use cases for this extension
    are strongly tied to privacy\n   issues, attention to the Security Considerations
    (Section 13) and the\n   Privacy Considerations (Section 14) is particularly important.
    \ Note,\n   especially, the limitation described in Section 13.3.\n"

  - "3.  Description\n   To address the problem described in Section 1, a mail-sending
    client\n   (usually an automated agent) needs to indicate to the server to which\n
    \  it is connecting that it expects the destination address of the\n   message
    to have been under continuous ownership (see Section 9) since\n   a specified
    point time.  That specified time would be the time when\n   the intended recipient
    gave the address to the message author, or\n   perhaps a more recent time when
    the intended recipient reconfirmed\n   ownership of the address with the sender.\n
    \  Two mechanisms are defined here: an extension to the Simple Mail\n   Transfer
    Protocol [SMTP] and a new message header field.  The SMTP\n   extension permits
    strong assurance of enforcement by confirming\n   support at each handling step
    for a message and the option to demand\n   support at all nodes in the handling
    path of the message (and\n   returning of the message to the originator otherwise).
    \ The header\n   field can be used when the Message Delivery Agent (MDA) supports
    this\n   function, but an intermediary system between the sending system and\n
    \  the MDA does not.  However, the header field does not provide the\n   same
    strong assurance described above and is more prone to exposure\n   of private
    information (see Section 14.1).\n   The SMTP extension is called \"RRVS\" and
    adds a parameter to the SMTP\n   \"RCPT\" command that indicates the most recent
    point in time when the\n   message author believed the destination mailbox to
    be under the\n   continuous ownership of a specific party.  Similarly, the \"Require-\n
    \  Recipient-Valid-Since\" header field includes an intended recipient\n   coupled
    with a timestamp indicating the same thing.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  The \"RRVS\" SMTP Extension\n   Extensions to SMTP are described in Section
      2.2 of [SMTP].\n   The name of the extension is \"RRVS\", an abbreviation of
      \"Require\n   Recipient Valid Since\".  Servers implementing the SMTP extension\n
      \  advertise an additional EHLO keyword of \"RRVS\", which has no\n   associated
      parameters, introduces no new SMTP commands, and does not\n   alter the MAIL
      command.\n   A Message Transfer Agent (MTA) implementing RRVS can transmit or\n
      \  accept one new parameter to the RCPT command.  An MDA can also accept\n   this
      new parameter.  The parameter is \"RRVS\", and the value is a\n   timestamp
      expressed as \"date-time\" as defined in [DATETIME], with the\n   added restriction
      that a \"time-secfrac\" MUST NOT be used.  The\n   timestamp MAY optionally
      be followed by a semicolon character and a\n   letter (known as the \"no-support
      action\"), indicating the action to\n   be taken when a downstream MTA is discovered
      that does not support\n   the extension.  Valid actions are \"R\" (reject; the
      default) and \"C\"\n   (continue).\n   Formally, the new parameter and its value
      are defined as follows:\n       rrvs-param = \"RRVS=\" date-time [ \";\" ( \"C\"
      / \"R\" ) ]\n   Accordingly, this extension increases the maximum command length
      for\n   the RCPT command by 33 characters.\n   The meaning of this extension,
      when used, is described in\n   Section 5.1.\n"

    - "3.2.  The \"Require-Recipient-Valid-Since\" Header Field\n   The general constraints
      on syntax and placement of header fields in a\n   message are defined in \"Internet
      Message Format\" [MAIL].\n   Using Augmented Backus-Naur Form [ABNF], the syntax
      for the field is:\n     rrvs = \"Require-Recipient-Valid-Since:\" addr-spec
      \";\" date-time\n            CRLF\n   \"date-time\" is defined in Section 3.3,

  - contents:
    - "3.3.  Timestamps\n   The header field version of this protocol has a different
      format for\n   the date and time expression than the SMTP extension does.  This
      is\n   because message header fields use a format to express date and time\n
      \  that is specific to message header fields, and this is consistent\n   with
      that usage.\n   Use of both date and time is done to be consistent with how
      current\n   implementations typically store the timestamp and to make it easy
      to\n   include the time zone.  In practice, granularity beyond the date may\n
      \  or may not be useful.\n"

  title: 3.  Description
- contents:
  - "4.  Use By Generators\n   When a message is generated whose content is sufficiently
    sensitive\n   that an author or author's ADministrative Management Domain (ADMD),\n
    \  see [EMAIL-ARCH], wishes to protect against misdelivery using this\n   protocol,
    it determines for each recipient mailbox on the message a\n   timestamp at which
    it last confirmed ownership of that mailbox.  It\n   then applies the SMTP extension
    when sending the message to its\n   destination.\n   In cases where the outgoing
    MTA does not support the extension, the\n   header field defined above can be
    used to pass the request through\n   that system.  However, use of the header
    field is only a \"best-\n   effort\" approach to solving the stated goals, and
    it has some\n   shortcomings:\n   1.  The positive confirmation of support at
    each handling node, with\n       the option to return the message to the originator
    when\n       end-to-end support cannot be confirmed, will be unavailable;\n   2.
    \ The protocol is focused on affecting delivery (that is, the\n       transaction)
    rather than content, and therefore use of a header\n       field in the content
    is generally inappropriate;\n   3.  The mechanism cannot be used with multiple
    recipients without\n       unintentionally exposing information about one recipient
    to the\n       others (see Section 7); and\n   4.  There is a risk of the timestamp
    parameter being inadvertently\n       forwarded, automatically or intentionally
    by the user (since user\n       agents might not reveal the presence of the header
    field), and\n       therefore exposed to unintended recipients.  (See Section
    14.4.)\n   Thus, the header field format MUST NOT be used unless the originator\n
    \  or relay has specific knowledge that the receiving MDA or an\n   intermediary
    MTA will apply it properly.  In any case, it SHOULD NOT\n   be used for the multi-recipient
    case.\n   Use of the header field mechanism is further restricted by the\n   practices
    described in Section 7.2 of [SMTP], Section 3.6.3 of\n   [MAIL], and Section 7
    of this document.\n"
  title: 4.  Use By Generators
- contents:
  - "5.  Handling By Receivers\n   If a receiver implements this specification, then
    there are two\n   possible evaluation paths:\n   1.  The sending client uses the
    extension, and so there is an RRVS\n       parameter on a RCPT TO command in the
    SMTP session, and the\n       parameters of interest are taken only from there
    (and the header\n       field, if present, is disregarded); or\n   2.  The sending
    client does not use the extension, so the RRVS\n       parameter is not present
    on the RCPT TO commands in the SMTP\n       session, but the corresponding header
    field might be present in\n       the message.\n   When the continuous ownership
    test fails for transient reasons (such\n   as an unavailable database or other
    condition that is likely\n   temporary), normal transient failure handling for
    the message is\n   applied.\n   If the continuous ownership test cannot be completed
    because the\n   necessary datum (the mailbox creation or reassignment date and
    time)\n   was not recorded, the MDA doing the evaluation selects a date and\n
    \  time to use that is the latest possible point in time at which the\n   mailbox
    could have been created or reassigned.  For example, this\n   might be the earliest
    of all recorded mailbox creation/reassignment\n   timestamps, or the time when
    the host was first installed.  If no\n   reasonable substitute for the timestamp
    can be selected, the MDA\n   rejects the message using an SMTP reply code, preferably
    with an\n   enhanced mail system status code (see Section 15.3), that indicates\n
    \  the test cannot be completed.  A message originator can then decide\n   whether
    to reissue the message without RRVS protection or find\n   another way to reach
    the mailbox owner.\n"
  - contents:
    - "5.1.  SMTP Extension Used\n   For an MTA supporting the SMTP extension, the
      requirement is to\n   continue enforcement of RRVS during the relaying process
      to the next\n   MTA or the MDA.\n   A receiving MTA or MDA that implements the
      SMTP extension declared\n   above and observes an RRVS parameter on a RCPT TO
      command checks\n   whether the current owner of the destination mailbox has
      held it\n   continuously, far enough back to include the given point in time,
      and\n   delivers it unless that check returns in the negative.  Specifically,\n
      \  an MDA will do the following before continuing with delivery:\n   1.  Ignore
      the parameter if the named mailbox is known to be a role\n       account as
      listed in \"Mailbox Names for Common Services, Roles\n       and Functions\"
      [ROLES].\n   2.  If the address is not known to be a role account, and if that\n
      \      address has not been under continuous ownership since the\n       timestamp
      specified in the extension, return a 550 error to the\n       RCPT command.
      \ (See also Section 15.3.)\n"

      - "5.1.1.  Relays\n   An MTA that does not make mailbox ownership checks, such
        as an MTA\n   positioned to do SMTP ingress at an organizational boundary,
        SHOULD\n   relay the RRVS extension parameter to the next MTA or MDA so that
        it\n   can be processed there.\n   For the SMTP extension, the optional RRVS
        parameter defined in\n   Section 5.1 indicates the action to be taken when
        relaying a message\n   to another MTA that does not advertise support for
        this extension.\n   When this is the case and the no-support action was not
        specified or\n   is \"R\" (reject), the MTA handling the message MUST reject
        the message\n   by:\n   1.  returning a 550 error to the DATA command, if
        synchronous service\n       is being provided to the SMTP client that introduced
        the message,\n       or\n   2.  generating a Delivery Status Notification
        [DSN] to indicate to\n       the originator of the message that the non-delivery

        system status code is defined for such rejections in\n   Section 15.3.\n   See
        Section 8.2 for additional discussion.\n   When relaying, an MTA MUST preserve
        the no-support action if it was\n   used by the SMTP client.\n"

    - "5.2.  Header Field Used\n   A receiving system that implements this specification,
      upon receiving\n   a message bearing a \"Require-Recipient-Valid-Since\" header
      field when\n   no corresponding RRVS SMTP extension was used, checks whether
      the\n   destination mailbox owner has held it continuously, far enough back\n
      \  to include the given date-time, and delivers it unless that check\n   returns
      in the negative.  Expressed as a sequence of steps:\n   1.  Extract those Require-Recipient-Valid-Since
      fields from the\n       message that contain a recipient for which no corresponding
      RRVS\n       SMTP extension was used.\n   2.  Discard any such fields that match
      any of these criteria:\n       *  are syntactically invalid;\n       *  name
      a role account as listed in [ROLES];\n       *  the \"addr-spec\" portion does
      not match a current recipient, as\n          listed in the RCPT TO commands
      in the SMTP session; or\n       *  the \"addr-spec\" portion does not refer
      to a mailbox handled\n          for local delivery by this ADMD.\n   3.  For
      each field remaining, determine if the named address has been\n       under
      continuous ownership since the corresponding timestamp.  If\n       it has not,
      reject the message.\n   4.  RECOMMENDED: If local delivery is being performed,
      remove all\n       instances of this field prior to delivery to a mailbox; if
      the\n       message is being forwarded, remove those instances of this header\n
      \      field that were not discarded by step 2 above.\n   Handling proceeds
      normally upon completion of the above steps if\n   rejection has not been performed.\n
      \  The final step is not mandatory as not all mail handling agents are\n   capable
      of stripping away header fields, and there are sometimes\n   reasons to keep
      the field intact such as debugging or presence of\n   digital signatures that
      might be invalidated by such a change.  See\n   Section 10 for additional discussion.\n
      \  If a message is to be rejected within the SMTP protocol itself\n   (versus
      generating a rejection message separately), servers\n   implementing this protocol

    are specified for a\n   single message resulting in multiple fields each with

    bearing a multiplicity of\n   Require-Recipient-Valid-Since header fields could
    result in a single\n   delivery attempt for multiple recipients (in particular,
    if two of\n   the recipients are handled by the same server), and if any one of\n
    \  them fails the test, the delivery fails to all of them; it then\n   becomes
    necessary to do one of the following:\n   o  reject the message on completion
    of the DATA phase of the SMTP\n      session, which is a rejection of delivery
    to all recipients, or\n   o  accept the message on completion of DATA, and then
    generate a\n      Delivery Status Notification [DSN] message for each of the failed\n
    \     recipients.\n   Additional complexity arises when a message is sent to two\n
    \  recipients, \"A\" and \"B\", presumably with different timestamps, both\n   of
    which are then redirected to a common address \"C\".  The author is\n   not necessarily
    aware of the current or past ownership of mailbox\n   \"C\", or indeed that \"A\"
    and/or \"B\" have been redirected.  This might\n   result in either or both of
    the two deliveries failing at \"C\", which\n   is likely to confuse the message
    author, who (as far as the author is\n   aware) never sent a message to \"C\"
    in the first place.\n   Finally, there is an obvious concern with the fan-out
    of a message\n   bearing the timestamps of multiple users; tight control over

    is defined as\n   having been under continuous ownership since a given date-time
    if a\n   message sent to the address at any point since the given date-time\n
    \  would not go to anyone except the owner at that given date-time.\n   That is,
    while an address may have been suspended or otherwise\n   disabled for some period,
    any mail actually delivered would have been\n   delivered exclusively to the same
    owner.  It is presumed that some\n   sort of relationship exists between the message
    sender and the\n   intended recipient.  Presumably, there has been some confirmation\n
    \  process applied to establish this ownership of the receiver's\n   mailbox;
    however, the method of making such determinations is a local\n   matter and outside
    the scope of this document.\n   Evaluating the notion of continuous ownership
    is accomplished by\n   doing any query that establishes whether the above condition
    holds\n   for a given mailbox.\n   Determining continuous ownership of a mailbox
    is a local matter at\n   the receiving site.  The only possible answers to the
    continuous-\n   ownership-since question are \"yes\", \"no\", and \"unknown\";
    the action\n   to be taken in the \"unknown\" case is a matter of local policy.\n
    \  For example, when control of a domain name is transferred, the new\n   domain
    owner might be unable to determine whether the owner of the\n   subject address
    has been under continuous ownership since the stated\n   date-time if the mailbox
    history is not also transferred (or was not\n   previously maintained).  It will
    also be \"unknown\" if whatever\n   database contains mailbox ownership data is
    temporarily unavailable\n   at the time a message arrives for delivery.  In this
    latter case,\n   typical SMTP temporary failure handling is appropriate.\n   To
    avoid exposing account details unnecessarily, if the address\n   specified has
    had one continuous owner since it was created, any\n   confirmation date-time
    SHOULD be considered to pass the test, even if\n   that date-time is earlier than
    the account creation date and time.\n   This is further discussed in Section 13.\n"

      to the wrong party after a\n   mailbox ownership change could allow the previous
      owner's data to be\n   exposed without his or her authorization or knowledge.
      \ In contrast,\n   the information that may be exposed to a third party via
      the proposal\n   in this document is limited to information about the mailbox
      history.\n   Given that MSPs have chosen to allow transfers of mailbox ownership\n
      \  without the prior owner's involvement, the information leakage from\n   the
      extensions specified here creates far lower overall risk than the\n   potential
      for delivering mail to the wrong party.\n"

    - "14.2.  Probing Attacks\n   As described above, use of this extension or header
      field in probing\n   attacks can disclose information about the history of the
      mailbox.\n   The harm that can be done by leaking any kind of private information\n
      \  is difficult to predict, so it is prudent to be sensitive to this\n   sort
      of disclosure, either inadvertently or in response to probing by\n   an attacker.
      \ It bears restating, then, that implementing\n   countermeasures against abuse
      of this capability needs strong\n   consideration.\n"

    - "14.3.  Envelope Recipients\n   The email To and Cc header fields are not required
      to be populated\n   with addresses that match the envelope recipient set, and
      Cc may even\n   be absent.  However, the algorithm in Section 3 requires that
      this\n   header field contain a match for an envelope recipient in order to
      be\n   actionable.  As such, use of this specification can reveal some or\n
      \  all of the original intended recipient set to any party that can see\n   the
      message in transit or upon delivery.\n   For a message destined to a single
      recipient, this is unlikely to be\n   a concern, which is one of the reasons
      use of this specification on\n   multi-recipient messages is discouraged.\n"

    - "14.4.  Risks with Use\n   MDAs might not implement the recommendation to remove
      the header\n   field defined here when messages are delivered, either out of\n
      \  ignorance or due to error.  Since user agents often do not render all\n   of
      the header fields present, the message could be forwarded to\n   another party
      that would then inadvertently have the content of this\n   header field.\n   A
      bad actor may detect use of either form of the RRVS protocol and\n   interpret
      it as an indication of high-value content.\n"
