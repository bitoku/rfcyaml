  - "1.  Introduction\n   [AUTHRES] defined a new header field for electronic mail
    messages\n   that presents the results of a message authentication effort in a\n
    \  machine-readable format.  Absent from that specification was the\n   means
    by which the results of two cryptographic signatures, such as\n   those provided
    by [DKIM], can both have results reported in an\n   unambiguous manner.\n   Fortunately,
    [AUTHRES] created IANA registries of reporting\n   properties, enabling an easy
    remedy for this problem.  This memo thus\n   registers an additional reporting
    property allowing a result to be\n   associated with a specific digital signature.\n"

  title: 2.  Keywords
- contents:
  - "3.  Discussion\n   A message can contain multiple signatures of a common sender\n
    \  authentication mechanism, such as [DKIM].  For example, a DomainKeys\n   Identified
    Mail (DKIM) signer could apply signatures using two or\n   more different message
    canonicalization algorithms to determine the\n   resistance of each to being broken
    in transit.\n   By applying supported \"ptype.property\" combinations (cf. the
    ABNF in\n   [AUTHRES]), a result can be associated with a given signature\n   provided
    the signatures are all unique within one of the registered\n   values (e.g., all
    of them had unique \"header.d\" or \"header.i\"\n   values).  This is not guaranteed,
    however; a single signing agent\n   might have practical reasons for affixing
    multiple signatures with\n   the same \"d=\" values while varying other signature
    parameters.  This\n   means one could get a \"dkim=pass\" and \"dkim=fail\" result\n
    \  simultaneously on verification, which is clearly ambiguous.\n   It is thus
    necessary either to create or to identify a signature\n   attribute guaranteed
    to be unique, such that it is possible to\n   unambiguously associate a result
    with the signature to which it\n   refers.\n   Collisions during general use of
    SHA1 and SHA256 are uncommon (see\n   [HASH-ATTACKS]), and RSA key signing mechanisms
    are resilient to\n   producing common substrings.  Thus, the actual digital signature
    for\n   a cryptographic signing of the message is an ideal property for such\n
    \  a unique identification.  It is not, however, necessary to include\n   the
    entire digital signature in an [AUTHRES] header field just to\n   identify which
    result goes with which signature; since the signatures\n   will almost always
    be substantially different, it is anticipated that\n   only the first several
    bytes of a signature will be needed for\n   disambiguating results.\n"

  - "4.  Definition\n   This memo adds the \"header.b\" reporting item to the IANA
    \"Email\n   Authentication Methods\" registry created upon publication of\n   [AUTHRES].
    \ The value associated with this item in the header field\n   MUST be at least
    the first eight characters of the digital signature\n   (the \"b=\" tag from a
    DKIM-Signature) for which a result is being\n   relayed, and MUST be long enough
    to be unique among the results being\n   reported.  Where the total length of
    the digital signature is fewer\n   than eight characters, the entire signature
    MUST be included.\n   Matching of the value of this item against the signature
    itself MUST\n   be case-sensitive.\n   If an evaluating agent observes that, despite
    the use of this\n   disambiguating tag, unequal authentication results are offered
    about\n   the same signature from the same trusted authserv-id, that agent\n   SHOULD
    ignore all such results.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   [AUTHRES] discussed general security considerations
    regarding the use\n   of this header field.  The following new security considerations\n
    \  apply when adding or processing this new ptype/property combination:\n"
  - contents:
    - "6.1.  Improvement\n   Rather than introducing a new security issue, this can
      be seen to fix\n   a security weakness of the original specification: Useful
      information\n   can now be obtained from results that could previously have
      been\n   ambiguous and thus obscured or, worse, misinterpreted.\n"
    title: 6.1.  Improvement
  - contents:
    - "6.2.  Result Forgeries\n   An attacker could copy a valid signature and add
      it to a message in\n   transit, modifying some portion of it.  This could cause
      two results\n   to be provided for the same \"header.b\" value even if the entire
      \"b=\"\n   string is used in an attempt to differentiate the results.  This\n
      \  attack could cause an ambiguous result to be relayed and possibly\n   neutralize
      any benefit given to a \"pass\" result that would have\n   otherwise occurred,
      possibly impacting the delivery of valid\n   messages.\n   It is worth noting,
      however, that a false negative (\"fail\") can be\n   generated in this way,
      but it is extremely difficult to create a\n   false positive (\"pass\") through
      such an attack.  Thus, a cautious\n   implementation could discard the false
      negative in that instance.\n"

  - contents:
    - "6.3.  New Schemes with Small Signatures\n   Should a new signing scheme be
      introduced with a signature whose\n   length is less than eight characters,
      Section 4 specifies that the\n   entire signature must be used.  The obvious
      concern in such a case\n   would be that the signature scheme is itself prone
      to collisions,\n   making the value reported by this field not useful.  In such
      cases,\n   the risk is created by the likelihood of collisions and not by this\n
      \  mechanism; furthermore, Section 4 recommends the results be ignored\n   if
      that were to occur, preventing the application of an ambiguous\n   result.\n"

      a sample\n   Example 1: Header field reporting results from multiple signatures\n
      \  added at initial signing\n   Here we see an example of a message that was
      signed twice by the\n   author's ADministrative Management Domain (ADMD).  One
      signature used\n   \"relaxed\" header canonicalization, and the other used \"simple\"
      header\n   canonicalization; both used \"simple\" body canonicalization.\n   Presumably
      due to a change in one of the five header fields covered\n   by the two signatures,
      the former signature passed, while the latter\n   signature failed to verify.
      \ In particular, the \"relaxed\" header\n   canonicalization of [DKIM] is resilient
      to changes in whitespace in\n   the header, while \"simple\" is not, and the
      latter is the one that\n   failed in this example.\n   The item registered by
      this memo allows an evaluation module to\n   determine which DKIM result goes
      with which signature.  Without the\n   \"header.b\" portion of the result, it
      is unclear which one passed and\n   which one failed.\n"
