- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The purpose of this memo is to focus discussion on the particular\n\
    \   problems with the exhaustion of the top level domain space in the\n   Internet\
    \ and the possible conflicts that can occur when multiple\n   organisations are\
    \ vying for the same name. The proposed solutions in\n   this document are intended\
    \ as a framework for development, such that\n   a general consensus will emerge\
    \ as to the appropriate solution to the\n   problems in each case, leading eventually\
    \ to the adoption of\n   standards.\n"
- title: 2.  Overview of the domain space
  contents:
  - "2.  Overview of the domain space\n   Presently the domain space is organised\
    \ as a heirarchical tree-\n   structured namespace with several top level domains\
    \ (TLDs), and sub-\n   domains beneath them. The initial TLDs allocated and rationale\
    \ are\n   documented in RFC 920 [1].\n   The TLDs are functionally split up into\
    \ 'generic' top-level domains\n   (gTLDs) and two-letter ISO 3166 country domains\
    \ for every country in\n   which Internet connectivity is provided. The allocation\
    \ of sub-\n   domains under these TLDs is entirely up to the registry for that\
    \ TLD.\n   The registry may decide to allocate further levels of structure or\n\
    \   merely allocate domains in a 'flat' manner.\n   Example:\n           +-----+\
    \         +----+                       +----+\n           | COM |         | UK\

    \  +----+       +-----+\n       1. Flat gTLD     2. Heirarchical country     \
    \ 3. Flat country\n   In the example we see that the gTLDs are inherently flat,\
    \ as\n   organisations are allocated domain names directly under the TLD.\n  \
    \ With the country domains however, the domain allocation policy can\n   vary\
    \ widely from country to country, and it does. Some may choose to\n   implement\
    \ a functional sub-structure mirroring the gTLDs, some may\n   choose to implement\
    \ a geographical sub-structure, and some may choose\n   to have no sub-structure\
    \ at all.\n   In the first case the organisation is clearly a commercial one,\
    \ as it\n   is allocatged under the \"COM\" TLD. However, there is no information\n\
    \   as to the country the organisation is based in.  In the third case,\n   we\
    \ know that the organisation is based in France (FR), but without\n   studying\
    \ the actual organisation name we do not know what type of\n   organisation it\
    \ is.  In the second case, we know the country that\n   both organisations are\
    \ based in (UK), and by following the heirarchy,\n   we can deduce that the first\
    \ is an academic organisation (AC), and\n   the second is commercial (CO).\n \
    \  While the system is flexible in not enforcing a strict heirarchy, it\n   can\
    \ lead to exhaustion of domain names in the generic space and lead\n   to conflicts\
    \ between organisations who may both have a legitimate\n   claim to have a particular\
    \ name.\n"
- title: 3.  Possible solutions to name exhaustion
  contents:
  - "3.  Possible solutions to name exhaustion\n   With such a flexible system, there\
    \ are many ways of preventing the\n   name space being exhausted. A solution proposed\
    \ by [2] is to create\n   more gTLDs to allow organisations with the same name\
    \ to be registered\n   uniquely under different TLDs (FIRM, STORE, WEB, ARTS,\
    \ REC, INFO and\n   NOM). However, this has several disadvantages as discussed\
    \ below:\n   a) It creates confusion in users mind as to what TLD refers to a\n\
    \      particular organisation. For example, MCDONALDS.COM maybe the fast\n  \
    \    food corporation and MCDONALDS.FIRM maybe a firm of lawyers, but\n      how\
    \ is the user supposed to know which is which?\n   b) To prevent the above confusion,\
    \ big corporations will simply\n      reserve all the different variations of\
    \ the name, ie. IBM.COM,\n      IBM.FIRM, IBM.STORE etc. Thus we haven't solved\
    \ the name\n      exhaustion or conflict problems, in fact we have made it worse.\n\
    \   c) Names of legitimate trade mark holders or other legally held names\n  \
    \    can still be acquired by anybody, leading to potential conflicts.\n   Another\
    \ set of possible solutions are discussed by The World\n   Intellectual Property\
    \ Organisation [4] but this only addresses\n   dispute resolution when trademarks\
    \ are used as domain names under\n   gTLDs, and not in the full legal context\
    \ of their origin of\n   registration.\n"
- title: 4.  Proposed solution
  contents:
  - "4.  Proposed solution\n   With the aforementioned problems in mind, it is not\
    \ a good idea to\n   create new gTLDs which merely overlap the existing ones.\
    \ As the\n   domain name system is heirarchical it would seem a good idea to\n\
    \   expand on the existing structure rather than creating several\n   duplicate\
    \ structures.\n"
- title: 4.1 The world is not flat so why should domains be?
  contents:
  - "4.1 The world is not flat so why should domains be?\n   With the expansion of\
    \ the Internet to a truly global medium, the\n   notion that there can only be\
    \ one commercial entity, one orgnisation,\n   and one network provider etc. with\
    \ the same name seems impossible.\n   This is the situation that the present system\
    \ finds itself in.  There\n   is a constantly spiralling number of disputes over\
    \ who 'owns' or\n   'deserves' a certain name, with an increasing number ending\
    \ in\n   unnecessary and costly legal action. This is not something that the\n\
    \   providers of a domain name service should concern themselves with,\n   but\
    \ yet with the present system, this seems inevitable.\n"
- title: 4.2 The case for legal names
  contents:
  - "4.2 The case for legal names\n   This proposal allows for country-code-based\
    \ domain names that are\n   related to legally registered names in the country\
    \ (or locality,\n   state or province within that country) that they are based\
    \ in, by\n   creating a functional heirarchy beneath the country TLD.\n   This\
    \ proposal does not seek to do away with gTLDs, but rather\n   suggests that a\
    \ legal name should be sought first and then, if\n   desired, a generic name could\
    \ be used alongside it. The organisation\n   would then, in case of any disputes,\
    \ have a legally-held name which\n   no other organisation could have any claim\
    \ to.\n   This proposal has several advantages:\n   a) The process of deciding\
    \ what names belong to which organisation\n      is no longer a function of the\
    \ domain name registry, but of the\n      company name or trade mark registration\
    \ authority in the given\n      locality. This means that disputes over names\
    \ cannot arise as all\n      names are unique within the context of the legal\
    \ name.\n   b) As all names are unique, there should be no exhaustion\n      (deliberately\
    \ or otherwise) of 'desirable' names by other\n      concerns, as all the owners\
    \ of legally-held names will\n      automatically have the right to the relevant\
    \ domain name.\n"
- title: 4.3 Allocation of legal sub-domains
  contents:
  - "4.3 Allocation of legal sub-domains\n      The sub-domain identifiers should\
    \ be created from the existing\n      indentifiers for company names and trade\
    \ marks within the given\n      locality, state, province or country.\n      The\
    \ general form of such a sub-domain is:\n      <legal-token>.<locality-identifier(s)>.<iso3166-country>\n\
    \      For example:\n      LTD.UK           for limited companies in the UK\n\
    \      PLC.UK           for public limited companies in the UK\n      TM.FR  \
    \          for trademarks in France\n      INC.<state>.US   }\n      LTD.<state>.US\
    \   } for incorpated bodies in the US\n      CO.<state>.US    } (each is equivalent)\n\
    \      CORP.<state>.US  }\n      LLC.<state>.US   for limited liability companies\
    \ in the US\n      GMBH.DE          for German companies\n   The registry for\
    \ the appropriate upper level country, state, province\n   or locality domain\
    \ should create entries in these sub-domains based\n   on the laws for allocating\
    \ such legal names in that particular\n   country, state, province or locality.\
    \  Specifically, the full legal\n   name should be used, but omitting the legal\
    \ token (eg. Ltd, Corp,\n   etc.) as this will be determined by the choice of\
    \ upper level domain.\n   ALL spaces within the name should be converted to hyphens\
    \ '-' and\n   other punctuation either disregarded or also converted into hyphens.\n\
    \   For holders of international trademarks and other international\n   names,\
    \ the gTLD \"INT\" can be used in place of the country identifier.\n   For example:\n\
    \      TM.INT  } for international trademarks\n      REG.INT }\n"
