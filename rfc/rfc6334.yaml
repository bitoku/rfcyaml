  - "1.  Introduction\n   Dual-Stack Lite [RFC6333] is a solution to offer both IPv4
    and IPv6\n   connectivity to customers that are addressed only with an IPv6 prefix\n
    \  (no IPv4 address is assigned to the attachment device).  One of its\n   key
    components is an IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel, commonly referred to as a\n   softwire.
    \ A DS-Lite \"Basic Bridging BroadBand\" (B4) device will not\n   know if the
    network it is attached to offers Dual-Stack Lite service,\n   and if it did would
    not know the remote endpoint of the tunnel to\n   establish a softwire.\n   To
    inform the B4 of the Address Family Transition Router's (AFTR)\n   location, a
    DNS [RFC1035] hostname may be used.  Once this\n   information is conveyed, the
    presence of the configuration indicating\n   the AFTR's location also informs
    a host to initiate Dual-Stack Lite\n   (DS-Lite) service and become a softwire
    initiator.\n   To provide the conveyance of the configuration information, a single\n
    \  DHCPv6 [RFC3315] option is used, expressing the AFTR's Fully\n   Qualified
    Domain Name (FQDN) to the B4 element.\n   The details of how the B4 establishes
    an IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire to the\n   AFTR are out of scope for this document.\n"

  - "3.  The AFTR-Name DHCPv6 Option\n   The AFTR-Name option consists of option-code
    and option-len fields\n   (as all DHCPv6 options have), and a variable-length
    tunnel-endpoint-\n   name field containing a fully qualified domain name that
    refers to\n   the AFTR to which the client MAY connect.\n   The AFTR-Name option
    SHOULD NOT appear in any DHCPv6 messages other\n   than the following: Solicit,
    Advertise, Request, Renew, Rebind,\n   Information-Request, and Reply.\n   The
    format of the AFTR-Name option is shown in the following figure:\n      0                   1

    endpoint.\n                 Figure 1: AFTR-Name DHCPv6 Option Format\n   The tunnel-endpoint-name
    field is formatted as required in DHCPv6\n   [RFC3315] Section 8 (\"Representation
    and Use of Domain Names\").\n   Briefly, the format described is using a single
    octet noting the\n   length of one DNS label (limited to at most 63 octets), followed
    by\n   the label contents.  This repeats until all labels in the FQDN are\n   exhausted,
    including a terminating zero-length label.  Any updates to\n   Section 8 of DHCPv6
    [RFC3315] also apply to encoding of this field.\n   An example format for this
    option is shown in Figure 2, which conveys\n   the FQDN \"aftr.example.com.\".\n

    \                 Figure 2: Example tunnel-endpoint-name\n   Note that in the
    specific case of the example tunnel-endpoint-name\n   (Figure 2), the length of
    the tunnel-endpoint-name is 18 octets, and\n   so an option-len field value of
    18 would be used.\n   The option is validated by confirming that all of the following\n
    \  conditions are met:\n   1.  the option-len is greater than 3;\n   2.  the option-len
    is less than or equal to the remaining number of\n       octets in the DHCPv6
    packet;\n   3.  the individual label lengths do not exceed the option length;\n
    \  4.  the tunnel-endpoint-name is of valid format as described in\n       DHCPv6
    Section 8 [RFC3315];\n   5.  there are no compression tags;\n   6.  there is at
    least one label of nonzero length.\n"
  title: 3.  The AFTR-Name DHCPv6 Option
- contents:
  - "4.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior\n   A DHCPv6 server SHOULD NOT send more than one
    AFTR-Name option.  It\n   SHOULD NOT permit the configuration of multiple names
    within one\n   AFTR-Name option.  Both of these conditions are handled as exceptions\n
    \  by the client, so an operator using software that does not perform\n   these
    validations should be careful not to configure multiple domain\n   names.\n   RFC
    3315 Section 17.2.2 [RFC3315] describes how a DHCPv6 client and\n   server negotiate
    configuration values using the Option Request option\n   (OPTION_ORO).  As a convenience
    to the reader, we mention here that a\n   server will not reply with an AFTR-Name
    option if the client has not\n   explicitly enumerated it on its Option Request
    option.\n"
  title: 4.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior
- contents:
  - "5.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior\n   A client that supports the B4 functionality of
    DS-Lite (defined in\n   [RFC6333]) and conforms to this specification MUST include\n
    \  OPTION_AFTR_NAME on its OPTION_ORO.\n   Because it requires a DNS name for
    address resolution, the client MAY\n   also wish to include the OPTION_DNS_SERVERS
    [RFC3646] option on its\n   OPTION_ORO.\n   If the client receives the AFTR-Name
    option, it MUST verify the\n   option contents as described in Section 3.\n   Note
    that in different environments, the B4 element and DHCPv6 client\n   may be integrated,
    joined, or separated by a third piece of software.\n   For the purpose of this
    specification, we refer to the \"B4 system\"\n   when specifying implementation
    steps that may be processed at any\n   stage of integration between the DHCPv6
    client software and the B4\n   element it is configuring.\n   If the B4 system
    receives more than one AFTR-Name option, it MUST use\n   only the first instance
    of that option.\n   If the AFTR-Name option contains more than one FQDN, as distinguished\n
    \  by the presence of multiple root labels, the B4 system MUST use only\n   the
    first FQDN listed in the configuration.\n   The B4 system performs standard DNS
    resolution using the provided\n   FQDN to resolve a AAAA Resource Record, as defined
    in [RFC3596] and\n   STD 13 ([RFC1034], [RFC1035]).\n   If any DNS response contains
    more than one IPv6 address, the B4\n   system picks only one IPv6 address and
    uses it as a remote tunnel\n   endpoint for the interface being configured in
    the current message\n   exchange.  The B4 system MUST NOT establish more than
    one DS-Lite\n   tunnel at the same time per interface.  For a redundancy and high-\n
    \  availability discussion, see Appendix A.3 (\"High Availability\") of\n   [RFC6333].\n
    \  Note that a B4 system may have multiple network interfaces, and these\n   interfaces
    may be configured differently; some may be connected to\n   networks that call
    for DS-Lite, and some may be connected to networks\n   that are using normal dual
    stack or other means.  The B4 system\n   should approach this specification on
    an interface-by-interface\n   basis.  For example, if the B4 system is attached
    to multiple\n   networks that provide the AFTR-Name option, then the B4 system
    MUST\n   configure a tunnel for each interface separately, as each DS-Lite\n   tunnel
    provides IPv4 connectivity for each distinct interface.  Means\n   to bind an
    AFTR-Name and DS-Lite tunnel configuration to a given\n   interface in a multiple-interface
    device are out of scope of this\n   document.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not present any new security
    issues, but as with\n   all DHCPv6-derived configuration state, it is completely
    possible\n   that the configuration is being delivered by a third party (Man in\n
    \  the Middle).  As such, there is no basis for trusting the access\n   level
    represented by the DS-Lite softwire connection, and DS-Lite\n   should therefore
    not bypass any security mechanisms such as IP\n   firewalls.\n   [RFC3315] discusses
    DHCPv6-related security issues.\n   [RFC6333] discusses DS-Lite-related security
    issues.\n"
