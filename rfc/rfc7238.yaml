- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   HTTP defines a set of status codes for the purpose of redirecting\
    \ a\n   request to a different URI ([RFC3986]).  The history of these status\n\
    \   codes is summarized in Section 6.4 of [RFC7231], which also\n   classifies\
    \ the existing status codes into four categories.\n   The first of these categories\
    \ contains the status codes 301 (Moved\n   Permanently), 302 (Found), and 307\
    \ (Temporary Redirect), which can be\n   classified as below:\n   +-------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+\n\
    \   |                                           | Permanent | Temporary |\n  \
    \ +-------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+\n   |\
    \ Allows changing the request method from   | 301       | 302       |\n   | POST\
    \ to GET                               |           |           |\n   | Does not\
    \ allow changing the request       | -         | 307       |\n   | method from\
    \ POST to GET                   |           |           |\n   +-------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+\n\
    \   Section 6.4.7 of [RFC7231] states that HTTP does not define a\n   permanent\
    \ variant of status code 307; this specification adds the\n   status code 308,\
    \ defining this missing variant (Section 3).\n"
- title: 2.  Notational Conventions
  contents:
  - "2.  Notational Conventions\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  308 Permanent Redirect
  contents:
  - "3.  308 Permanent Redirect\n   The 308 (Permanent Redirect) status code indicates\
    \ that the target\n   resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future\n\
    \   references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.\n   Clients\
    \ with link editing capabilities ought to automatically re-link\n   references\
    \ to the effective request URI (Section 5.5 of [RFC7230]) to\n   one or more of\
    \ the new references sent by the server, where possible.\n   The server SHOULD\
    \ generate a Location header field ([RFC7231],\n   Section 7.1.2) in the response\
    \ containing a preferred URI reference\n   for the new permanent URI.  The user\
    \ agent MAY use the Location field\n   value for automatic redirection.  The server's\
    \ response payload\n   usually contains a short hypertext note with a hyperlink\
    \ to the new\n   URI(s).\n   A 308 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless\
    \ otherwise\n   indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls\
    \ (see\n   [RFC7234], Section 4.2.2).\n      Note: This status code is similar\
    \ to 301 (Moved Permanently)\n      ([RFC7231], Section 6.4.2), except that it\
    \ does not allow changing\n      the request method from POST to GET.\n"
- title: 4.  Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Deployment Considerations\n   Section 6 of [RFC7231] requires recipients\
    \ to treat unknown 3xx\n   status codes the same way as status code 300 Multiple\
    \ Choices\n   ([RFC7231], Section 6.4.1).  Thus, servers will not be able to rely\n\
    \   on automatic redirection happening similar to status codes 301, 302,\n   or\
    \ 307.\n   Therefore, initial use of status code 308 will be restricted to cases\n\
    \   where the server has sufficient confidence in the client's\n   understanding\
    \ the new code or when a fallback to the semantics of\n   status code 300 is not\
    \ problematic.  Server implementers are advised\n   not to vary the status code\
    \ based on characteristics of the request,\n   such as the User-Agent header field\
    \ (\"User-Agent Sniffing\") -- doing\n   so usually results in code that is both\
    \ hard to maintain and hard to\n   debug and would also require special attention\
    \ to caching (i.e.,\n   setting a \"Vary\" response header field, as defined in\
    \ Section 7.1.4\n   of [RFC7231]).\n   Note that many existing HTML-based user\
    \ agents will emulate a refresh\n   when encountering an HTML <meta> refresh directive\
    \ ([HTML]).  This\n   can be used as another fallback.  For example:\n   Client\
    \ request:\n     GET / HTTP/1.1\n     Host: example.com\n   Server response:\n\
    \     HTTP/1.1 308 Permanent Redirect\n     Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n\
    \     Location: http://example.com/new\n     Content-Length: 454\n     <!DOCTYPE\
    \ HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\"\n                           \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd\"\
    >\n     <html>\n        <head>\n           <title>Permanent Redirect</title>\n\
    \           <meta http-equiv=\"refresh\"\n                 content=\"0; url=http://example.com/new\"\
    >\n        </head>\n        <body>\n           <p>\n              The document\
