  - "                    Proposed Standard Socket Numbers\nI propose that there be\
    \ a czar (me ?) who hands out official socket\nnumbers for use by standard protocols.\
    \  This czar should also keep track\nof and publish a list of those socket numbers\
    \ where host specific\nservices can be obtained.  I further suggest that the initial\
    \ allocation\nbe as follows:\n        Sockets         Assignment\n        0-63\
    \            Network wide standard functions\n        64-127          Host specific\
    \ functions\n        128-239         Reserved for future use\n        240-255\
    \         Any experimental function\nand within the network wide standard functions\
    \ the following particular\nassignment be made:\n        Socket          Assignment\n\
    \           1            Telnet\n           3            File Transfer\n     \
    \      5            Remote Job Entry\n           7            Echo\n         \
    \  9            Discard\nthese socket numbers (decimal) are to be used for the\
    \ socket called \"L\"\nin the official Initial Connection protocol (ICP) as specified\
    \ in NIC\n7104 the \"Current Network Protocols\" notebook.\n       [ This RFC\
    \ was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC\
    \ archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.  \
