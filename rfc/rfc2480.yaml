    NOT\", and \"MAY\"\n   appear capitalized, they are being used to indicate particular\n
    \  requirements of this specification. A discussion of the meanings of\n   the
    terms \"MUST\", \"SHOULD\", and \"MAY\" appears in  RFC 1123 [2]; the\n   terms
    \"MUST NOT\" and \"SHOULD NOT\" are logical extensions of this\n   usage.\n"

  - "3.  The Problem\n   Security multiparts [RFC-1847] provide an effective way to
    add\n   integrity and confidentiality services to protocols that employ MIME\n
    \  objects [RFC-2045, RFC-2046]. Difficulties arise, however, in\n   heterogeneous
    environments involving gateways to environments that\n   don't support MIME. Specifically:\n
    \   (1)   Security services have to be applied to MIME objects in\n          their
    entirety. Failure to do so can lead to security\n          exposures.\n          For
    example, a signature that covers only object data and not\n          the object's
    MIME labels would allow someone to tamper with\n          the labels in an undetectable
    fashion.  Similarly, failure to\n          encrypt MIME label information exposes
    information about the\n          content that could facilitate traffic analysis.\n
    \         Composite MIME objects (e.g., multipart/mixed, message/rfc822)\n          also
    have to be secured as a unit.  Again, failure to do so\n          may facilitate
    tampering, reveal important information\n          unnecessarily, or both.\n    (2)
    \  Gateways that deal with MIME objects have to be able to\n          convert
    them to non-MIME formats.\n          For example, gateways often have to transform
    MIME labelling\n          information into other forms. MIME type information
    may end up\n          being expressed as a file extension or as an OID.\n          Gateways
    also have to take apart composite MIME objects into\n          their component
    parts, converting the resulting set of parts\n          into whatever form the
    non-MIME environments uses for\n          composite objects. Failure to do so
    makes the objects unusable\n          in any environment that doesn't support
    MIME. In many cases\n          this also means that multi-level MIME structures
    have to be\n          converted into a sequential list of parts.\n    (3)   Security
    services have to be deployed in an end-to-end\n          fashion. Failure to do
    so again can lead to security\n          exposures.\n          An integrity service
    deployed at something other than a\n          connection end point means a region
    exists between the point\n          where the integrity service is applied and
    the actual end\n          point where object tampering is possible. A confidentiality\n
    \         service deployed at something other than a connection end\n          point
    means a region exists where the object is transferred in\n          the clear.
    And worse, distributed private keys are usually\n          necessary whenever
    someone other than the originator applies\n          an integrity service or someone
    other than the recipient\n          removes a confidentiality service, which in
    turn may make\n          theft of private key information a possibility.\n          All
    of these issues can be addressed, of course. For example,\n          it may be
    possible to use multiple overlapping security\n          services to assure that
    no exposure exists even though there\n          is no end-to-end security per
    se. And keys can be distributed\n          in a secure fashion. However, such
    designs tend to be quite\n          complex, and complexity in a security system
    is highly\n          undesireable.\n   The preceeding three requirments are fundamentally
    in conflict: It is\n   possible to satisfy two of them at once, but not all three
    at once.\n   In fact the conflict is even worse than it first appears. In most\n
    \  situations of this sort some sort of compromise is possible which,\n   while
    not satisfying any of the requirements completely, does\n   optimize some sort
    of average of all the requirements. Such a\n   solution does not exist in this
    case, however, because many real\n   world situations exist where any one of these
    requirements absolutely\n   must be satisfied.\n"

  - "4.  Solving the Problem\n   Since the previously described problem doesn't allow
    for a single\n   solution the only viable approach is to require that gateways
    provide\n   multiple solutions.  In particular, gateways\n    (1)   MUST provide
    the ability to tunnel multipart/signed and\n          multipart/encrypted objects
    as monolithic entities if there is\n          any chance whatsoever that MIME
    capabilities exist on the\n          non-MIME side of the gateway. No changes
    to content of the\n          multipart are permitted, even when the content is
    itself a\n          composite MIME object.\n          This option must be provided
    so that entities behind the\n          gateway that are capable of processing
    security multiparts and\n          their MIME content will work properly.  As
    mentioned\n          previously, situations exist where application security\n
    \         requirements are absolute and must be accomodated, even when\n          meeting
    them causes problems for other agents.\n          Exceptions are allowed only
    when there is no possibility of\n          MIME support on one side of the gateway.
    \ For example, a\n          gateway to a voice messaging system may have no useful
    way to\n          represent a signed MIME object.\n    (2)   MUST provide the
    ability to take apart multipart/signed\n          objects, exposing the content
    (and in the process ruining the\n          signature). When this approach is selected,
    gateways SHOULD\n          NOT remove the signature. Instead, gateways SHOULD
    keep the\n          signature intact and add to it a note that it will probably
    be\n          invalid for checking the message contents, but may still be\n          contain
    valuable information about the sender.\n          This option must be provided
    so that entities behind the\n          gateway which are incapable of processing
    MIME will work\n          properly.\n    (3)   SHOULD provide the ability to select
    between the previous two\n          options on per-user basis.\n    (4)   MAY
    provide facilities to check signatures and decrypt\n          encrypted content.
    Such facilities MUST NOT be enabled by\n          default; the potential security
    exposure involved has to be\n          assessed before such capabilities can be
    used.\n    (5)   MAY provide facilities to sign and/or encrypt material passing\n
    \         from the non-MIME side to the MIME side of the gateway. Again,\n          such
    facilities MUST NOT be enabled by default; the potential\n          security exposure
    involved in the transfer of unsecured\n          content within the application
    domain behind the gateway has\n          to be assessed before such capabilities
    can be used.\n   A gateway which complies with the above requirements is considered
    to\n   be security multiparts compliant.\n"
