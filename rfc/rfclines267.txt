On November 18, however, the BBN prototype Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) was inaccessible due to hardware debugging.
Several Hosts are  currently  excluded  fron
These Hosts fall into two categories:
1)  Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network as servers (available for use from other sites) for at least two weeks.
Hosts which are curently intended to be users only.
Included here are the Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network (AMES, MITRE, and BBN ).
This category also includes the Network Control Center Computer (Network Address 5) which is used solely for gathering statistics from the Network.
Finally, included among these Hosts are the following:
During these two weeks the Lincoln Labs TX2 Hosts became a Network User.
The SDC IBM 360/67 is now a server.
The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used to refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.
host not included in daily testing.
(Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to network partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal IMP.)
(Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)
(Destination Host did not respond in any way to the initial RFC, although not dead.)
H   1/2 Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either immediately closed it, or did not respond further.)
(Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible to users.)
The UCLA IBM 360/91 currently has Remote Job Service (NETRJS), but has not implemented a full server Telnet System.
The BBN Terminal IMP is not equipped to test NETRJS; however, we are assuming that receipt of the UCLA explanatory message indicates that NETRJS is also functioning.
# These sites advertise that they may not have their system available at these times.
