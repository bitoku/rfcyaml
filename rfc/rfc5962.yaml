  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Presence Information Data Format - Location Object (PIDF-LO)
    (see\n   RFC 4119 [RFC4119]) provides geographical location of a presentity.\n
    \  This corresponds to a physical location at a given instance of time.\n   RFC
    5491 [RFC5491] extends PIDF-LO and provides additional guidelines\n   to implementers.\n
    \  This document extends PIDF-LO to convey spatial orientation, speed,\n   and
    heading of a presentity.  The addition of rate-of-change\n   information to the
    PIDF-LO enables a range of use cases.  These use\n   cases either use dynamic
    information directly or use that information\n   for smoother tracking of a position
    over time.  For example, an\n   application that continuously tracks a presentity
    could use velocity\n   information to extrapolate positions in between times that
    location\n   information is measured.  A shipping company could directly use speed\n
    \  to monitor delivery truck speed to ensure speed limits are observed.\n"

    \  \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",\n
    \  and \"OPTIONAL\" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119\n   [RFC2119].\n
    \  This document uses the term \"presentity\", as defined in RFC 2778\n   [RFC2778],
    to refer to the device subject to location determination.\n   The similarity to
    presence concepts and the abstract location privacy\n   architecture, as described
    in RFC 4079 [RFC4079], led to re-use of\n   the Presence Information Data Format
    (PIDF) (see RFC 3863 [RFC3863]),\n   and its enhancement for location information
    (see RFC 4119\n   [RFC4119]).  Note that this document does not differentiate
    between\n   human and non-human objects, and hence both are in scope.\n"

  - "3.  Dynamic Elements\n   This document defines a new element, <Dynamic>, for
    the conveyance of\n   dynamic information.\n   Dynamic information MAY be included
    without any other location\n   information being present.  When dynamic information
    is associated\n   with information about the instantaneous position of the presentity,\n
    \  the <Dynamic> element MUST be included in the same <location-info>\n   element
    as the corresponding geodetic (or civic) location\n   information.\n   Dynamic
    information can be safely ignored by a recipient that does\n   not support this
    specification.  The <Dynamic> element contains the\n   following components:\n
    \  orientation:\n      The <orientation> element describes the spatial orientation
    of the\n      presentity -- the direction that the object is pointing.  For a\n
    \     device, this orientation might depend on the type of device.  See\n      Section
    3.1 for details.\n   speed:\n      Speed is the time rate of change in position
    of a presentity\n      without regard for direction: the scalar component of velocity.\n
    \     The value for the <speed> element is a measure that is defined in\n      meters
    per second.\n   heading:\n      Heading is the directional component of velocity.
    \ See Section 3.1\n      for details.\n   Each element can be omitted if no information
    is available.  In the\n   following example, the presentity is approximately oriented
    to the\n   North at a slightly elevated angle.  The presentity is travelling\n
    \  24 meters per second to the West:\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n

    - "3.1.  Angular Measures and Coordinate Reference Systems\n   [RFC5491] constrains
      the coordinate reference system (CRS) used in\n   PIDF-LO to World Geodetic
      System 1984 (WGS 84), using either the two-\n   dimensional (latitude, longitude)
      CRS identified by\n   \"urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326\" or the three-dimensional
      (latitude,\n   longitude, altitude) CRS identified by \"urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4979\".\n
      \  Dynamic locations similarly assume that either of these coordinate\n   reference
      systems will be used.\n   The <orientation> and <heading> elements both describe
      a direction.\n   The <orientation> element describes the \"direction of facing\";
      the\n   <heading> element describes the \"direction of travel\".  Both measures\n
      \  contain one or two angular values that are expressed relative to the\n   current
      position of the presentity (see Appendix A).  Angular\n   measures are expressed
      in degrees, and values can be negative.  If\n   two measures are present, the
      values MUST be separated by whitespace.\n   The first measure specifies the
      horizontal direction from the current\n   position of the presentity to a point
      that it is pointing towards\n   (for <orientation>) or travelling towards (for
      <heading>).\n   Horizontal angles are measured from Northing to Easting.  Horizontal\n
      \  angles start from zero when pointing to or travelling towards the\n   North
      and increase towards the East.\n   The second measure, if present, specifies
      the vertical component of\n   this angle.  This angle is the elevation from
      the local horizontal\n   plane.  If the second angle value is omitted, the vertical
      component\n   is unknown.  If only one angle is present, <orientation> describes\n
      \  only the horizontal component.  For <heading>, the associated <speed>\n   measure
      contains only the horizontal component of speed.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document defines additional location elements
    carried by\n   PIDF-LO.  These additional elements provide greater reason to observe\n
    \  the privacy and security considerations described in RFC 4119\n   [RFC4119].
    \ No further privacy or security measures are necessary.\n   RFC 4119 points back
    to RFC 3694 [RFC3694] and RFC 3693 [RFC3693] to\n   describe the threat model
    and the security requirements imposed on\n   the GEOPRIV architecture for sharing
    location information as a result\n   of the threat model.  It is important to
    note that these two\n   documents often refer to threats related to the current
    location\n   information of a presentity, while this document introduces dynamic\n
    \  information that may be used by attackers to anticipate the future\n   location
    of a presentity.  While already a series of location\n   snapshots is likely to
    offer information for guessing the future\n   location of a presentity, it has
    to be said that including more\n   information in a PIDF-LO does increase the
    severity of an information\n   leak.  Those who deploy location-based services
    are in general\n   strongly advised to provide their users with ways to control
    the\n   distribution of location information to those who have been\n   authorized
