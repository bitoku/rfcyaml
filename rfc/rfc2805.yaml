  - "3.  Definitions\n   *    Connection\n   Under the control of a Media Gateway\
    \ Controller (MGC), the Media\n   Gateway (MG) realizes connections. In this document,\
    \ connections are\n   associations of resources hosted by the MG. They typically\
    \ involve\n   two terminations, but may involve more.\n   *    Line or Loop\n\
    \   An analogue or digital access connection from a user terminal which\n   carries\
    \ user media content and telephony access signalling (DP, DTMF,\n   BRI, proprietary\
    \ business set).\n   *    Media Gateway (MG) function\n   A Media Gateway (MG)\
    \ function provides the media mapping and/or\n   transcoding functions between\
    \ potentially dissimilar networks, one of\n   which is presumed to be a packet,\
    \ frame or cell network.  For\n   example, an MG might terminate switched circuit\
    \ network (SCN)\n   facilities (trunks, loops), packetize the media stream, if\
    \ it is not\n   already packetized, and deliver packetized traffic to a packet\n\
    \   network.  It would perform these functions in the reverse order for\n   media\
    \ streams flowing from the packet network to the SCN.\n   Media Gateways are not\
    \ limited to SCN <-> packet/frame/cell\n   functions: A conference bridge with\
    \ all packet interfaces could be an\n   MG, as well as an (IVR) interactive voice\
    \ recognition unit, an audio\n   resource function, or a voice recognition system\
    \ with a cell\n   interface.\n   *    Media Gateway unit (MG-unit)\n   An MG-unit\
    \ is a physical entity that contains an MG function and may\n   also contain other\
    \ functions, e.g. an SG function.\n   *    Media Gateway Controller (MGC) function\n\
    \   A Media Gateway Controller (MGC) function controls a MG.\n   *    Media Resource\n\
    \   Examples of media resources are codecs, announcements, tones, and\n   modems,\
    \ interactive voice response (IVR) units, bridges, etc.\n   *    Signaling Gateway\
    \ (SG) function\n   An SG function receives/sends SCN native signalling at the\
    \ edge of a\n   data network. For example the SG function may relay, translate\
    \ or\n   terminate SS7 signaling in an SS7-Internet Gateway. The SG function\n\
    \   may also be co-resident with the MG function to process SCN\n   signalling\
    \ associated with line or trunk terminations controlled by\n   the MG, such as\
    \ the \"D\" channel of an ISDN PRI trunk.\n   *    Termination\n   A termination\
    \ is a point of entry and/or exit of media flows relative\n   to the MG. When\
    \ an MG is asked to connect two or more terminations,\n   it understands how the\
    \ flows entering and leaving each termination\n   are related to each other.\n\
    \   Terminations are, for instance, DS0's, ATM VCs and RTP ports. Another\n  \
    \ word for this is bearer point.\n   *    Trunk\n   An analog or digital connection\
    \ from a circuit switch which carries\n   user media content and may carry telephony\
    \ signalling (MF, R2, etc.).\n   Digital trunks may be transported and may appear\
    \ at the Media Gateway\n   as channels within a framed bit stream, or as an ATM\
    \ cell stream.\n   Trunks are typically provisioned in groups, each member of\
    \ which\n   provides equivalent routing and service.\n   *    Type of Bearer\n\
    \   A Type of Bearer definition provides the detailed requirements for\n   its\
    \ particular application/bearer type. A particular class of Media\n   Gateway,\
    \ for example, would support a particular set of Bearer types.\n"
- title: 4.  Specific functions assumed within the MG
  contents:
  - "4.  Specific functions assumed within the MG\n   This section provides an environment\
    \ for the definition of the\n   general Media Gateway Control Protocol requirements.\n\
    \   MGs can be architected in many different ways depending where the\n   media\
    \ conversions and transcoding (if required) are performed, the\n   level of programmability\
    \ of resources, how conferences are supported,\n   and how associated signalling\
    \ is treated. The functions assumed to be\n   within the MG must not be biased\
    \ towards a particular architecture.\n   For instance, announcements in a MG could\
    \ be provided by media\n   resources or by the bearer point resource or termination\
    \ itself.\n   Further, this difference must not be visible to MGC: The MGC must\
    \ be\n   able to issue the identical request to two different implementations\n\
    \   and achieve the identical functionality.\n   Depending on the application\
    \ of the MG (e.g., trunking, residential),\n   some functions listed below will\
    \ be more prominent than others, and\n   in some cases, functions may even disappear.\n\
    \   Although media adaptation is the essence of the MG, it is not\n   necessary\
    \ for it to be involved every time. An MG may join two\n   terminations/resources\
    \ of the same type (i.e., the MG behaves as a\n   switch). The required media\
    \ conversion depends on the media type\n   supported by the resources being joined\
    \ together.\n   In addition to media adaptation function, resources have a number\
    \ of\n   unique properties, for instance:\n   *    certain types of resources\
    \ have associated signalling\n        capabilities (e.g., PRI signalling, DTMF),\n\
    \   *    some resources perform maintenance functions (e.g., continuity\n    \
    \    tests),\n   *    the MGC needs to know the state changes of resources (e.g.,\
    \ a\n        trunk group going out of service),\n   *    the MG retains some control\
    \ over the allocation and control of\n        some resources (e.g., resource name\
    \ space: RTP port numbers).\n   Therefore, an MG realizes point-to-point connections\
    \ and conferences,\n   and supports several resource functions. These functions\
    \ include\n   media conversion, resource allocation and management, and event\n\
    \   notifications.  Handling termination associated signalling is either\n   done\
    \ using event notifications, or is handled by the signalling\n   backhaul part\
    \ of a MG-unit (i.e. NOT directly handled by the MG).\n   MGs must also support\
    \ some level of system related functions, such as\n   establishing and maintaining\
    \ some kind of MG-MGC association. This is\n   essential for MGC redundancy, fail-over\
    \ and resource sharing.\n   Therefore, an MG is assumed to contain these functions:\n\
    \   *    Reservation and release, of resources\n   *    Ability to provide state\
    \ of resources\n   *    Maintenance of resources - It must be possible to make\n\
    \        maintenance operations independent of other termination\n        functions,\
    \ for instance, some maintenance states should not\n        affect the resources\
    \ associated with that resource . Examples of\n        maintenance functions are\
    \ loopbacks and continuity tests.\n   *    Connection management, including connection\
    \ state.\n   *    Media processing, using media resources: these provide services\n\
    \        such as transcoding, conferencing, interactive voice recognition\n  \
    \      units, audio resource function units. Media resources may or may\n    \
    \    not be directly part of other resources.\n   *    Incoming digit analysis\
    \ for terminations, interpretation of\n        scripts for terminations\n   *\
    \    Event detection and signal insertion for per-channel signalling\n   *   \
    \ Ability to configure signalling backhauls (for example, a\n        Sigtran backhaul)\n\
    \   *    Management of the association between the MGC and MG, or between\n  \
    \      the MGC and MG resources.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1.  Resource Reservation\n   The protocol must:\n   a.   Support reservation\
    \ of bearer terminations and media resources\n        for use by a particular\
    \ call and support their subsequent\n        release (which may be implicit or\
    \ explicit).\n   b.   Allow release in a single exchange of messages, of all resources\n\
    \        associated with a particular set of connectivity and/or\n        associations\
    \ between a given number terminations.\n   c.   The MG is not required (or allowed)\
    \ by the protocol to maintain\n        a sense of future time: a reservation remains\
    \ in effect until\n        explicitly released by the MGC.\n"

    \  Allow the specification of bearer plane (e.g. Frame Relay, IP,\n        etc.)\
    \ on a call by call basis.\n   d.   Support unidirectional, symmetric bi-directional,\
    \ and asymmetric\n        bi-directional flows of media.\n   e.   Support multiple\
    \ media types (e.g. audio, text, video, T.120).\n   f.   Support point-to-point\
    \ and point-to-multipoint connections.\n   g.   Support creation and modification\
    \ of more complex flow\n        topologies e.g. conference bridge capabilities.\
    \  Be able to add\n        or delete media streams during a call or session, and\
    \ be able to\n        add or subtract participants to/from a call or session.\n\
    \   h.   Support inclusion of media resources into call or session as\n      \
    \  required.  Depending on the protocol and resource type, media\n        resources\
    \ may be implicitly included, class-assigned, or\n        individually assigned.\n\
    \   i.   Provide unambiguous specification of which media flows pass\n       \
    \ through a point and which are blocked at a given point in time,\n        if\
    \ the protocol permits multiple flows to pass through the same\n        point.\n\
    \   j.   Allow modifications of an existing termination, for example, use\n  \
    \      of higher compression to compensate for insufficient bandwidth\n      \
    \  or changing transport network connections.\n   k.   Allow the MGC to specify\
    \ that a given connection has higher\n        priority than other connections.\n\
    \   l.   Allow a reference to a port/termination on the MG to be a\n        logical\
    \ identifier,\n        with a one-to-one mapping between a logical identifier\
    \ and a\n        physical port.\n   m.   Allow the MG to report events such as\
    \ resource reservation and\n        connection completion.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Media Transformations
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Media Transformations\n   The Protocol must:\n   a.   Support mediation/adaptation\
    \ of flows between different types of\n        transport\n   b.   Support invocation\
    \ of additional processing such as echo\n        cancellation.\n   c.   Support\
    \ mediation of flows between different content encoding\n        (codecs, encryption/decryption)\n\
    \   d.   Allow the MGC to specify whether text telephony/FAX/data modem\n    \
    \    traffic is to be terminated at the MG, modulated/demodulated,\n        and\
    \ converted to packets or forwarded by the MG in the media\n        flow as voice\
    \ band traffic.\n   e.   Allow the MGC to specify that Dual-Tone MultiFrequency\
    \ (DTMF)\n        digits or other line and trunk signals and general Multi-\n\
    \        Frequency (MF) tones are to be processed in the MG and how these\n  \
    \      digits/signals/tones are to be handled. The MGC must be able to\n     \
    \   specify any of the following handling of such\n        digits/signals/tones:\n\
    \   1.   The digits/signals/tones are to be encoded normally in the audio\n  \
    \      RTP stream (e.g., no analysis of the digits/signals/tones).\n   2.   Analyzed\
    \ and sent to the MGC.\n   3.   Received from the MGC and inserted in the line-side\
    \ audio\n        stream.\n   4.   Analyzed and sent as part of a separate RTP\
    \ stream (e.g., DTMF\n        digits sent via a RTP payload separate from the\
    \ audio RTP\n        stream).\n   5.   Taken from a separate RTP stream and inserted\
    \ in the line-side\n        audio stream.\n   6.   Handled according to a script\
    \ of instructions.  For all but the\n        first case, an option to mute the\
    \ digits/signals/tones with\n        silence, comfort noise, or other means (e.g.,\
    \ notch filtering of\n        some telephony tones) must be provided.  As detection\
    \ of these\n        events may take up to tens of milliseconds, the first few\n\
    \        milliseconds of such digit/signal/tone may be encoded and sent\n    \
    \    in the audio RTP stream before the digit/signal/tone can be\n        verified.\
    \ Therefore muting of such digits/signals/tones in the\n        audio RTP stream\
    \ with silence or comfort noise is understood to\n        occur at the earliest\
    \ opportunity after the digit/signal/tone is\n        verified.\n   f.   Allow\
    \ the MGC to specify signalled flow characteristics on\n        circuit as well\
    \ as on packet bearer connections, e.g. u-law/a-\n        law.\n   g.   Allow\
    \ for packet/cell transport adaptation only (no media\n        adaptation) e.g.\
    \ mid-stream (packet-to-packet)\n        transpacketization/transcoding, or ATM\
    \ AAL5 to and from ATM AAL2\n        adaptation.\n   h.   Allow the transport\

  contents:
  - "11.2.8.1.  Play Audio Module\n   a.   Be able to provide the following basic\
    \ operation:\n   -    request an ARF MG to play an announcement.\n   b.   Be able\
    \ to specify these play characteristics:\n   -    Play volume\n   -    Play speed\n\
    \   -    Play iterations\n   -    Interval between play iterations\n   -    Play\
    \ duration\n   c.   Permit the specification of voice variables such as DN, number,\n\

    \     the value (eg 234-3456), and well as the type (Directory\n        number).\n\
    \   d.   Using the terminology that a segment is a unit of playable\n        speech,\
    \ or is an abstraction that is resolvable to a unit of\n        playable speech,\
    \ permit specification of the following segment\n        types:\n   -    A provisioned\
    \ recording.\n   -    A block of text to be converted to speech.\n   -    A block\
    \ of text to be displayed on a device.\n   -    A length of silence qualified\
    \ by duration.\n   -    An algorithmically generated tone.\n   -    A voice variable,\
    \ specified by type and value.  Given a variable\n        type and value, the\
    \ IVR/ARF unit would dynamically assemble the\n        phrases required for its\
    \ playback.\n   -    An abstraction that represents a sequence of audio segments.\n\
    \        Nesting of these abstractions must also be permitted.\n   An example\
    \ of this abstraction is a sequence of audio segments, the\n   first of which\
    \ is a recording of the words \"The number you have\n   dialed\", followed by\
    \ a Directory Number variable, followed by a\n   recording of the words \"is no\
    \ longer in service\".\n   -    An abstraction that represents a set of audio\
    \ segments and which\n        is resolved to a single segment by a qualifier.\
    \  Nesting of\n        these abstractions must be permitted.\n   For example take\
    \ a set of audio segments recorded in different\n   languages all of which express\
    \ the semantic concept \"The number you\n   have dialed is no longer in service\"\
    .  The set is resolved by a\n   language qualifier. If the qualifier is \"French\"\
    , the set resolves to\n   the French version of this announcement.\n   In the\
    \ case of a nested abstraction consisting of a set qualified by\n   language at\
    \ one level and and a set qualified by gender at another\n   level,  it would\
    \ be possible to specify that an announcement be\n   played in French  and spoken\
    \ by a female voice.\n   e.   Provide two different methods of audio specification:\n\
    \   -    Direct specification of the audio components to be played by\n      \
    \  specifying the sequence of segments in the command itself.\n   -    Indirect\
    \ specification of the audio components to be played by\n        reference to\
    \ a single identifier that resolves to a provisioned\n        sequence of audio\
    \ segments.\n"
