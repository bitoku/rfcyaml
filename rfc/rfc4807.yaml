  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines a MIB module for configuration of\
    \ an IPsec\n   security policy database (SPD).  The IPsec model this MIB is designed\n\
    \   to configure is based on the \"IPsec Configuration Policy Model\"\n   (IPCP)\
    \ [RFC3585].  The IPCP's IPsec model is, in turn, derived from\n   the Distributed\
    \ Management Task Force's (DMTF) IPsec model (see\n   below) and from the IPsec\
    \ model specified in RFC 2401 [RFC2401].\n   Note: RFC 2401 has been updated by\
    \ RFC 4301 [RFC4301], but this\n   implementation is based on RFC 2401.  The policy-based\
    \ packet\n   filtering and the corresponding execution of actions configured by\n\
    \   this MIB is of a more general nature than for IPsec configuration\n   only,\
    \ such as for configuration of a firewall.  It is possible to\n   extend this\
    \ MIB module and add other packet-transforming actions that\n   are performed\
    \ conditionally on an interface's network traffic.\n   The IPsec- and IKE-specific\
    \ actions are as documented in\n   [IPsec-ACTION] and [IKE-ACTION], respectively,\
    \ and are not documented\n   in this document.\n"

- title: 4.  Relationship to the DMTF Policy Model
  contents:
  - "4.  Relationship to the DMTF Policy Model\n   The Distributed Management Task\
    \ Force (DMTF) has created an object\n   oriented model of IPsec policy information\
    \ known as the IPsec Policy\n   Model White Paper [IPPMWP].  The \"IPsec Configuration\
    \ Policy Model\"\n   (IPCP) [RFC3585] is based, in large part, on the DMTF's IPsec\
    \ policy\n   model and on RFC 2401 [RFC2401].  The IPCP document describes a model\n\
    \   for configuring IPsec.  This MIB module is a task-specific derivation\n  \
    \ (i.e., an SMIv2 instantiation) of the IPCP's IPsec configuration\n   model for\
    \ use with Simple Network Management Protocol version 3\n   (SNMPv3).\n   The\
    \ high-level areas where this MIB module diverges from the IPCP\n   model are:\n\
    \   o  Policies, Groups, Conditions, and some levels of Actions are\n      generically\
    \ named.  In other words, IPsec-specific prefixes like\n      \"SA\" (Security\
    \ Association), or \"IPsec\", are not used.  This\n      naming convention is\
    \ used because packet classification and the\n      matching of conditions to\
    \ actions is more general than IPsec.  The\n      tables in this document can\
    \ possibly be reused by other packet-\n      transforming actions, which need\
    \ to conditionally act on packets\n      matching filters.\n   o  Filters are\
    \ implemented in a more generic and scalable manner,\n      rather than enforcing\
    \ the condition/filtering pairing of the IPCP\n      and its restrictions upon\
    \ the user.  This MIB module offers a\n      compound filter object providing\
    \ greater flexibility for complex\n      filters than the IPCP.\n"
- title: 5.  MIB Module Overview
  contents:
  - "5.  MIB Module Overview\n   The MIB module is modularized into several different\
    \ parts: rules,\n   filters, and actions.\n   The rules section associates endpoints\
    \ and groups of rules, and\n   consists of the spdEndpointToGroupTable, spdGroupContentsTable,\
    \ and\n   the spdRuleDefinitionTable.  Each row of the spdRuleDefinitionTable\n\
    \   connects a filter to an action.  It should also be noted that by\n   referencing\
    \ the spdCompoundFilterTable, the spdRuleDefinitionTable's\n   filter column can\
    \ indicate a set of filters to be processed.\n   Likewise, by referencing the\
    \ spdCompoundActionTable, the\n   spdRuleDefinitionTable's action column can indicate\
    \ multiple actions\n   to be executed.\n   This MIB is structured to allow for\
    \ reuse through the future creation\n   of extension tables that provide additional\
    \ filters and/or actions.\n   In fact, the companion documents to this one ([IPsec-ACTION]\
    \ and\n   [IKE-ACTION]) do just that and define IPsec- and IKE-specific actions\n\
    \   to be used within this SPD configuration MIB.  Note: it is expected\n   that,\
    \ in order to function properly, extension action MIBs may impose\n   additional\
    \ limitations on the objects in this MIB and how they can be\n   used with the\
    \ extended actions.  An extension action may only support\n   a subset of the\
    \ configuration options available in this MIB.\n   The filter section of the MIB\
    \ module is composed of the different\n   types of filters in the Policy Model.\
    \  It is made up of the\n   spdTrueFilter, spdCompoundFilterTable, spdSubfiltersTable\n\
    \   spdIpHeaderFilterTable, spdIpOffsetFilterTable, spdTimeFilterTable,\n   spdIpsoHeaderFilterTable.\n\
    \   The action section of this MIB module contains only the simple static\n  \
    \ actions required for the firewall processing that an IPsec SPD\n   implementation\
    \ requires (e.g., accept, drop, log, etc.).  The\n   companion documents of this\
    \ document define the complex actions\n   necessary for IPsec and IKE negotiations.\n\
    \   As may have been noticed above, the MIB uses recursion in a similar\n   manner\
    \ in several different places.  In particular, the\n   spdGroupContentsTable,\
    \ the spdCompoundFilterTable /\n   spdSubfiltersTable combination, and the spdCompoundActionTable\
    \ /\n   spdSubactionsTable combination can reference themselves.\n   In the case\
    \ of the spdGroupContentsTable, a row can indicate a rule\n   (i.e., a row in\
    \ the spdRuleDefinitionTable) or a group (i.e., another\n   set of one or more\
    \ rows in the spdGroupContentsTable).  This way, a\n   group can contain a set\
    \ of rules and sub-groups.  Sub-groups are just\n   other groups defined in the\
    \ spdGroupContentsTable.  There is no\n   inherent MIB limit to the depth of nesting\
    \ of groups.\n   The spdCompoundFilterTable / spdSubfiltersTable combination and\n\
    \   spdCompoundActionTable / spdSubactionsTable combination are designed\n   almost\
    \ identically, with one being for filters and the other for\n   actions, respectively.\
    \  The following descriptions for the compound\n   filter tables can be directly\
    \ applied to the compound action tables.\n   The combination of the tables spdCompoundFilterTable\
    \ and\n   spdSubfiltersTable allow a user to create a set of filters that can\n\
    \   be referenced from any table as a single filter.  A row in the\n   spdCompoundFilterTable\
    \ has the basic configuration information for\n   the compound filter.  The index\
    \ of spdCompoundFilterTable,\n   spdCompFiltname, is also used as a partial index\
    \ to reference a set\n   of ordered rows in the spdSubfiltersTable.  Each row\
    \ in\n   spdSubfiltersTable points to a row in another filter table.  In this\n\
    \   way, the set of rows in spdSubFiltersTable with a matching\n   spdCompFiltName,\
    \ together with the row in spdCompoundFilterTable\n   indexed by spdCompFiltName,\
    \ create a compound filter.  Note that it\n   is possible for a row in the spdSubfiltersTable\
    \ to point to a row in\n   the spdCompoundFilterTable.  This recursion allows\
    \ the creation of a\n   filter set that includes other filter sets within it.\
    \  There is no\n   inherent MIB limit to the nesting of compound filters within\
    \ compound\n   filters.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Usage Tutorial
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Usage Tutorial\n   In order to use the tables contained in this document,\
    \ a general\n   understanding of firewall processing is helpful.  The processing\
    \ of\n   the security policy database (SPD) involves applying a set of SPD\n \
    \  rules to an interface on a device.  The given set of rules to apply\n   to\
    \ any given interface is defined within the spdEndpointToGroupTable\n   table.\
    \  This table maps a given interface to a group of rules.  In\n   this table,\
    \ the interface itself is specified using its assigned\n   address.  There is\
    \ also one group of rules per direction (ingress and\n   egress).\n"

    \   1.  All the example operations in the following section make use of\n    \
    \   default values for all columns not listed.  The operations and\n       column\
    \ values given in the examples are the minimal SNMP Varbinds\n       that must\
    \ be sent to create a row.\n   2.  The example operations are formatted such that\
    \ a row (i.e., the\n       table's Entry object) is operated on by using the indexes\
    \ to that\n       row and the column values for that row.\n   3.  Below is a generic\
    \ example of the notation used in the following\n       section's examples of\
    \ this MIB's usage.  This example indicates\n       that the MIB row to be set\
    \ is the row with the index values of\n       value1 for index1, and value2 for\
    \ index2.  Within this row,\n       column1 is set to column_value1, and column2\
    \ is set to\n       column_value2.:\n       rowEntry(index1     = value1,\n  \
    \              index2     = value2)\n             = (column1        = column_value1,\n\
    \                column2        = column_value2)\n   4.  The below is a specific\
    \ example of the notation used in the\n       following section's examples of\
    \ this MIB's usage.  This example\n       represents the status column of a row\
    \ in the IP-\n       MIB::ipAddressTable table being set to deprecated.  The index\n\
    \       values for this row are IPv4 and 192.0.2.1.  The example notation\n  \
    \     would look like the following:\n       ipAddressEntry(ipAddressAddrType\
    \ = 1,           -- ipv4\n                      ipAddressAddr     = 0xC0000201\
    \ ) -- 192.0.2.1\n                   = (ipAddressStatus   = 2)           -- deprecated\n"
- title: 5.1.2.  Implementing an Example SPD Policy
  contents:
  - "5.1.2.  Implementing an Example SPD Policy\n   As an example, let us define the\
    \ following administrative policy: On\n   the network interface with IP address\
    \ 192.0.2.1, all traffic from\n   host 192.0.2.6 will be dropped and all other\
    \ traffic will be\n   accepted.\n   This policy is enforced by setting the values\
    \ in the MIB to do the\n   following:\n   o  create a filter for 192.0.2.6\n \
    \  o  create a rule that connects the 192.0.2.6 filter to a packet drop\n    \
    \  action\n   o  create a rule that always accepts packets\n   o  group these\
    \ rules together in the proper order so that the\n      192.0.2.6 drop rule is\
    \ checked first.\n   o  connect this group of rules to the 192.0.2.1 interface\n\
    \   The first step to do this is creating the filter for the IPv4 address\n  \
    \ 192.0.2.6:\n   SpdIpHeaderFilterEntry(spdIpHeadFiltName = \"192.0.2.6\")\n \
    \        = (spdIpHeadFiltType            = 0x80,        -- sourceAddress\n   \
    \         spdIpHeadFiltIPVersion       = 1,           -- IPv4\n            spdIpHeadFiltSrcAddressBegin\
    \ = 0xC0000206,  -- 192.0.2.6\n            spdIpHeadFiltSrcAddressEnd   = 0xC0000206,\
    \  -- 192.0.2.6\n            spdIpHeadFiltRowStatus       = 4)           -- createAndGo\n\
    \   Next, a rule is created to connect the above \"192.0.2.6\" filter to an\n\
    \   action to \"drop\" the packet, as follows:\n   spdRuleDefinitionEntry(spdRuleDefName\
    \ = \"drop from 192.0.2.6\")\n         = (spdRuleDefFilter             =\n   \
    \                spdIpHeadFiltType.9.49.57.50.46.48.46.50.46.54,\n           \
    \ spdRuleDefAction             = spdDropAction.0,\n            spdRuleDefRowStatus\
    \          = 4)           -- createAndGo\n   Next, a rule is created that accepts\
    \ all packets:\n   spdRuleDefinitionEntry(spdRuleDefName = \"accept all\")\n \
    \        = (spdRuleDefFilter             = spdTrueFilter.0,\n            spdRuleDefAction\
    \             = spdAcceptAction.0,\n            spdRuleDefRowStatus          =\
    \ 4)           -- createAndGo\n   Next, these two rules are grouped together.\
    \  Rule groups attached to\n   an interface are processed one row at a time. \
    \ The rows are processed\n   from lowest to highest spdGroupContPriority value.\
    \  Because the row\n   that references the \"accept all\" rule should be processed\
    \ last, it is\n   given the higher spdGroupContPriority value.\n   SpdGroupContentsEntry(spdGroupContName\
    \     = \"ingress\",\n                         spdGroupContPriority = 65535)\n\
    \        = (spdGroupContComponentName          = \"accept all\",\n           spdGroupContRowStatus\
    \              = 4)      -- createAndGo\n   SpdGroupContentsEntry(spdGroupContName\
    \     = \"ingress\",\n                         spdGroupContPriority = 1000)\n\
    \        = (spdGroupContComponentName          = \"drop from 192.0.2.6\",\n  \
    \         spdGroupContRowStatus              = 4)      -- createAndGo\n   Finally,\
    \ this group of rules is connected to the 192.0.2.1 interface\n   as follows:\n\
    \   SpdEndpointToGroupEntry(spdEndGroupDirection = 1,    -- ingress\n        \
    \                   spdEndGroupIdentType = 4,    -- IPv4\n                   \
    \        spdEndGroupAddress   = 0xC0000001)\n        = (spdEndGroupName = \"ingress\"\
    ,\n           spdEndGroupRowStatus = 4)                    -- createAndGo\n  \
    \ This completes the necessary steps to implement the policy.  Once all\n   of\
    \ these rules have been applied, the policy should take effect.\n"

    \ within\n         this row is exercised.  Managers can use this object to\n \
    \        classify groups of rules, or subgroups, together in order to\n      \
    \   achieve a greater degree of control and optimization over\n         the execution\
    \ order of the items within the group.  If the\n         filter evaluates to false,\
    \ the rule or subgroup will be\n         skipped and the next rule or subgroup\
    \ will be evaluated\n         instead.  This value can be used to indicate a scalar\
    \ or\n         row in a table.  When indicating a row in a table, this\n     \
    \    value MUST point to the first column instance in that row.\n         An example\
    \ usage of this object would be to limit a\n         group of rules to executing\
    \ only when the IP packet\n         being processed is designated to be processed\
    \ by IKE.\n         This effectively creates a group of IKE-specific rules.\n\

- title: 7.1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Introduction\n   This document defines a MIB module used to configure IPsec\
    \ policy\n   services.  Since IPsec provides network security services, all of\
    \ its\n   configuration data (e.g., this entire MIB) SHOULD be as secure or\n\
    \   more secure than any of the security services IPsec provides.  There\n   are\
    \ two main threats you need to protect against when configuring\n   IPsec devices.\n\
    \   1.  Malicious Configuration: This MIB configures network security\n      \
    \ services.  If an attacker has SET access to any part of this MIB,\n       the\
    \ network security services configured by this MIB SHOULD be\n       considered\
    \ broken.  The network data sent through the associated\n       gateway should\
    \ no longer be considered as protected by IPsec\n       (i.e., it is no longer\
    \ confidential or authenticated).\n       Therefore, only the official administrators\
    \ SHOULD be allowed to\n       configure a device.  In other words, administrators'\
    \ identities\n       SHOULD be authenticated and their access rights checked before\n\
    \       they are allowed to do device configuration.  The support for SET\n  \
    \     operations to the SPD MIB in a non-secure environment, without\n       proper\
    \ protection, will invalidate the security of the network\n       traffic affected\
    \ by the SPD MIB.\n   2.  Disclosure of Configuration: In general, malicious parties\
    \ SHOULD\n       NOT be able to read security configuration data while the data\
    \ is\n       in network transit.  An attacker reading the configuration data\n\
    \       may be able to find misconfigurations in the MIB that enable\n       attacks\
    \ to the network or to the configured node.  Since this\n       entire MIB is\
    \ used for security configuration, it is highly\n       RECOMMENDED that only\
    \ authorized administrators are allowed to\n       view data in this MIB.  In\
    \ particular, malicious users SHOULD be\n       prevented from reading SNMP packets\
    \ containing this MIB's data.\n       SNMP GET data SHOULD be encrypted when sent\
    \ across the network.\n       Also, only authorized administrators SHOULD be allowed\
    \ SNMP GET\n       access to any of the MIB objects.\n   SNMP versions prior to\
    \ SNMPv3 do not include adequate security.  Even\n   if the network itself is\
    \ secure (e.g., by using IPsec), earlier\n   versions of SNMP have virtually no\
    \ control as to who on the secure\n   network is allowed to access (i.e., read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the\n   objects in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers\
    \ use the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410],\
    \ section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms\
    \ (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions\
    \ prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy\
    \ SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n\
    \   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance\
    \ of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects\
    \ only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to GET or SET\
    \ (change/create/delete) them.\n   Therefore, when configuring data in the IPSEC-SPD-MIB,\
    \ you SHOULD use\n   SNMP version 3.  The rest of this discussion assumes the\
    \ use of\n   SNMPv3.  This is a real strength, because it allows administrators\n\
    \   the ability to load new IPsec configuration on a device and keep the\n   conversation\
    \ private and authenticated under the protection of SNMPv3\n   before any IPsec\
    \ protections are available.  Once initial\n   establishment of IPsec configuration\
    \ on a device has been achieved,\n   it would be possible to set up IPsec SAs\
    \ to then also provide\n   security and integrity services to the configuration\
    \ conversation.\n   This may seem redundant at first, but will be shown to have\
    \ a use for\n   added privacy protection below.\n"
- title: 7.2.  Protecting against Unauthenticated Access
  contents:
  - "7.2.  Protecting against Unauthenticated Access\n   The current SNMPv3 User Security\
    \ Model provides for key-based user\n   authentication.  Typically, keys are derived\
    \ from passwords (but are\n   not required to be), and the keys are then used\
    \ in Hashed Message\n   Authentication Code (HMAC) algorithms (currently, MD5\
    \ and SHA-1 HMACs\n   are defined) to authenticate all SNMP data.  Each SNMP device\
    \ keeps a\n   (configured) list of users and keys.  Under SNMPv3 user keys may\
    \ be\n   updated as often as an administrator cares to have users enter new\n\
    \   passwords.  But Perfect Forward Secrecy for user keys in SNMPv3 is\n   not\
    \ yet provided by standards track documents, although RFC2786\n   defines an experimental\
    \ method of doing so.\n"
- title: 7.3.  Protecting against Involuntary Disclosure
  contents:
  - "7.3.  Protecting against Involuntary Disclosure\n   While sending IPsec configuration\
    \ data to a Policy Enforcement Point\n   (PEP), there are a few critical parameters\
    \ that MUST NOT be observed\n   by third parties.  Specifically, except for public\
    \ keys, keying\n   information MUST NOT be allowed to be observed by third parties.\n\
    \   This includes IKE Pre-Shared Keys and possibly the private key of a\n   public/private\
    \ key pair for use in a PKI.  Were either of those\n   parameters to be known\
    \ to a third party, they could then impersonate\n   the device to other IKE peers.\
    \  Aside from those critical parameters,\n   policy administrators have an interest\
    \ in not divulging any of their\n   policy configuration.  Any knowledge about\
    \ a device's configuration\n   could help an unfriendly party compromise that\
    \ device.  SNMPv3 offers\n   privacy security services, but at the time this document\
    \ was written,\n   the only standardized encryption algorithm supported by SNMPv3\
    \ is the\n   DES encryption algorithm.  Support for other (stronger) cryptographic\n\
    \   algorithms is in the works and may be completed by the time you read\n   this.\
    \  As of October 2006, there is a stronger standards track\n   algorithm: AES\
    \ [RFC3826].  When configuring the IPsec policy using\n   this MIB, policy administrators\
    \ SHOULD use a privacy security service\n   that is at least as strong as the\
    \ desired IPsec policy, e.g., If an\n   administrator were to use this MIB to\
    \ configure an IPsec connection\n   that utilizes a AES algorithms, the SNMP communication\
    \ configuring\n   the connection SHOULD be protected by an algorithm as strong\
    \ or\n   stronger than the AES algorithm.\n"
- title: 7.4.  Bootstrapping Your Configuration
  contents:
  - "7.4.  Bootstrapping Your Configuration\n   Most vendors will not ship new products\
    \ with a default SNMPv3 user/\n   password pair, but it is possible.  If a device\
    \ does ship with a\n   default user/password pair, policy administrators SHOULD\
    \ either\n   change the password or configure a new user, deleting the default\n\
    \   user (or, at a minimum, restrict the access of the default user).\n   Most\
    \ SNMPv3 distributions should, hopefully, require an out-of-band\n   initialization\
    \ over a trusted medium, such as a local console\n   connection.\n"
- title: 8.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  IANA Considerations\n   Only two IANA considerations exist for this document.\
    \  The first is\n   just the node number allocation of the IPSEC-SPD-MIB itself\
    \ within\n   the MIB-2 tree.  This is listed in the MIB definition in Section\
    \ 6.\n   The IPSEC-SPD-MIB also allows for extension action MIBs.  Although\n\
    \   additional actions are not required to use it, the node spdActions is\n  \
    \ allocated as a subtree under which IANA can assign additional\n   actions.\n\
    \   The second IANA consideration is that IANA would be responsible for\n   creating\
    \ a new subregistry for and assigning nodes under the\n   spdActions subtree.\
    \  This tree should have a prefix of\n   iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.spdMIB.spdActions\
    \ and be listed\n   similar to the following:\n   Decimal      Name      Description\
    \      References\n   -------      ----      -----------      ----------\n   A\
    \ documented specification is required in order to assign a number.\n   The action\
    \ and it's meaning can be specified in an RFC or in another\n   publicly available\
    \ reference.  The specification should have\n   sufficient detail that interoperability\
    \ between independent\n   implementations is possible.  The product of the IETF\
    \ or of another\n   standards body is acceptable or an assignment can be accepted\
    \ under\n   the advice of a \"designated expert\". (contact IANA for the current\n\
    \   expert)\n"
