  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines a mechanism whereby a SMTP client can request,\
    \ when\n   transmitting a message to a SMTP server, that the server deliver the\n\
    \   message within a prescribed period of time.  A client making such a\n   request\
    \ also specifies the message handling which is to occur if the\n   message cannot\
    \ be delivered within the specified time period: either\n   the message is to\
    \ be returned as undeliverable with no further\n   processing, or a \"delayed\"\
    \ delivery status notification (DSN) [6] is\n   to be issued.\n   This extension\
    \ should not be viewed as a vehicle for requesting\n   \"priority\" processing.\
    \  A receiving SMTP server may assign whatever\n   processing priority it wishes\
    \ to a message transmitted with a Deliver\n   By request.  A Deliver By request\
    \ serves to express a message's\n   urgency and to provide an additional degree\
    \ of determinancy in its\n   processing.  An indication of an urgent message's\
    \ status within a\n   given time period may be requested and will be honored.\
    \  Moreover,\n   the message may be withdrawn if not delivered within that time\n\
    \   period.\n   A typical usage of this mechanism is to prevent delivery of a\
    \ message\n   beyond some future time of significance to the sender or recipient\n\
    \   but not known by the MTAs handling the message.  For instance, the\n   sender\
    \ may know that the message will be delivered as a page but does\n   not consider\
    \ the message to be sufficiently important as to warrant\n   paging the recipient\
    \ after business hours. In that case, the message\n   could be marked such that\
    \ delivery attempts are not made beyond\n   17:00.  Another common usage arises\
    \ when a sender wishes to be\n   alerted to delivery delays.  In this case, the\
    \ sender can mark a\n   message such that if it is not delivered within, say,\
    \ 30 minutes, a\n   \"delayed\" DSN is generated but delivery attempts are nonetheless\n\
    \   continued.  In this case the sender has been allowed to express a\n   preference\
    \ for when they would like to learn of delivery problems.\n"
- title: 1.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "1.  Definitions\n   Throughout this document, the term \"deliver\" is taken to\
    \ mean the act\n   of transmitting a message to its \"final\" destination by a\
    \ message\n   transport agent (MTA).  Usually, but not always, this means storing\n\
    \   or otherwise handing off the message to the recipient's mailbox.\n   Thus,\
    \ an MTA which accepts a message to be delivered within a\n   specified time period\
    \ is agreeing to store or handoff the message to\n   the recipient's mailbox within\
    \ the specified time period.  Outside\n   the scope of the term \"deliver\" are\
    \ any user-specified actions which\n   might take place after the MTA stores or\
    \ hands off the message; e.g.,\n   user-programmed filters which, often unbeknownst\
    \ to the MTA, resend\n   the message to some other location.\n   The key words\
    \ \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"SHOULD\" and \"SHOULD NOT\" in this\n   document are\
    \ to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [7].\n"
- title: 2.  Framework for the Deliver By SMTP service extension
  contents:
  - "2.  Framework for the Deliver By SMTP service extension\n   The Deliver By SMTP\
    \ service extension uses the SMTP service extension\n   mechanism described in\
    \ [4].  The following SMTP service extension is\n   therefore defined:\n   (1)\
    \  The name of the SMTP service extension is \"Deliver By\".\n   (2)  The EHLO\
    \ keyword value associated with this service extension is\n        \"DELIVERBY\"\
    .\n   (3)  One optional parameter is allowed with this EHLO keyword value.\n \
    \       The optional parameter, when supplied, is a comma separated list\n   \
    \     of options.  Only one option, a min-by-time, is specified in\n        this\
    \ document.  Future documents may extend this specification\n        by specifying\
    \ additional options.  The min-by-time is a fixed\n        integer indicating\
    \ the fixed minimum by-time that the server\n        will accept when a by-mode\
    \ of \"R\" is specified as per Section 4.\n        The syntax of the optional\
    \ parameter is as follows, using the\n        augmented BNF notation of RFC 2234\
    \ [2]:\n      deliverby-param = min-by-time *( ',' extension-token )\n      min-by-time\
    \     = [1*9DIGIT]\n      extension-token = 1*<any CHAR excluding SP, COMMA and\
    \ all control\n                           characters (US ASCII 0-31 inclusive)>\n\
    \      SP               = <the space character (ASCII decimal code 32)>\n    \
    \  COMMA            = <the comma character (ASCII decimal code 44)>\n        If\
    \ the parameter is omitted, no information is conveyed about\n        the server's\
    \ fixed minimum by-time.\n   (4)  One optional parameter using the keyword \"\
    BY\" is added to the\n        MAIL FROM command.\n   (5)  The maximum length of\
    \ a MAIL FROM command line is increased by\n        17 characters by the possible\
    \ addition of the BY keyword and\n        value.\n   (6)  No additional SMTP verbs\
    \ are defined by this extension.\n"
- title: 3.  The Deliver By SMTP service extension
  contents:
  - "3.  The Deliver By SMTP service extension\n   A SMTP client wishing to use the\
    \ Deliver By SMTP service extension\n   may issue the EHLO command to start a\
    \ SMTP session and to determine\n   if the SMTP server supports the service extension.\
    \  If the server\n   responds with code 250 to the EHLO command, and the response\
    \ includes\n   the EHLO keyword DELIVERBY, then the Deliver By SMTP service\n\
    \   extension is supported by the server.\n   If a numeric parameter follows the\
    \ DELIVERBY keyword value of the\n   EHLO response then that parameter indicates\
    \ the minimum value allowed\n   for the by-time when a by-mode of \"R\" is specified\
    \ with the extended\n   MAIL FROM command as described in Section 4.  Any attempt\
    \ by a client\n   to specify a by-mode of \"R\" and a by-time strictly less than\
    \ this\n   limit, min-by-time, will be rejected with a permanent failure (55z)\n\
    \   reply code.\n   A SMTP server that supports the Deliver By SMTP service extension\n\
    \   will accept the extended version of the MAIL FROM command described\n   in\
    \ Section 4.  When supported by the server, a SMTP client may use\n   the extended\
    \ MAIL FROM command (instead of the MAIL FROM command\n   described in [1]) to\
    \ request that the message be delivered within the\n   specified time period.\
    \  The server may then return an appropriate\n   error code if it determines that\
    \ the request cannot be honored.  Note\n   that this may not be apparent to the\
    \ server until either presentation\n   of the recipient addresses with RCPT TO\
    \ commands or completion of the\n   transfer of the message data with the dot\
    \ (.) command.  As such, the\n   server may send to the client a success response\
    \ to the MAIL FROM\n   command only to later return an error response to the RCPT\
    \ TO, DATA,\n   or dot command.\n"
- title: 4.  The extended MAIL FROM command
  contents:
  - "4.  The extended MAIL FROM command\n   The extended MAIL FROM command is issued\
    \ by a SMTP client when it\n   wishes to inform a SMTP server that a message is\
    \ to be delivered\n   within a specified period of time and further what action\
    \ to take\n   should the message prove undeliverable within that time period.\
    \  The\n   extended MAIL FROM command is identical to the MAIL FROM command as\n\
    \   defined in RFC 821 [1], except that a BY parameter appears after the\n   address.\n\
    \   The complete syntax of this extended command is defined in [4].  The\n   esmtp-keyword\
    \ is \"BY\" and the syntax for the esmtp-value is given by\n   the syntax for\
    \ by-value shown below.  In the augmented BNF of RFC\n   2234 [2], the syntax\
    \ for the BY esmtp-parameter is\n   by-parameter = \"BY=\"by-value\n   by-value\
    \     = by-time\";\"by-mode[by-trace]\n   by-time      = [\"-\" / \"+\"]1*9digit\
    \ ; a negative or zero value is not\n                                      ; allowed\
    \ with a by-mode of \"R\"\n   by-mode      = \"N\" / \"R\"           ; \"Notify\"\
    \ or \"Return\"\n   by-trace     = \"T\"                 ; \"Trace\"\n   Note\
    \ that the BY esmtp-keyword MUST have an associated esmtp-value.\n   The by-time\
    \ is a decimal representation of the number of seconds\n   within which the message\
    \ should be delivered and has the range\n     -999,999,999 seconds <= by-time\
    \ <= +999,999,999 seconds\n   and is thus sufficient to represent a time anywhere\
    \ from\n   approximately 31.6 years in the past to 31.6 years in the future.\n\
    \   As described in Section 4.1, the by-mode indicates the action the\n   SMTP\
    \ server must take should it not be possible to transmit the\n   message within\
    \ by-time seconds.\n   Note that by-time is a delta time: the number of seconds\
    \ within which\n   to deliver the message.  This delta time does not extend an\
    \ MTA's\n   normal retention period for undeliverable messages nor is it a\n \
    \  \"deliver after\" time.\n   A delta time is used so as to prevent problems\
    \ associated with\n   differences in system clocks between clients and servers.\
    \  Servers in\n   receipt of a valid by-parameter are expected to convert the\
    \ by-time\n   into a locale-specific absolute time called the deliver-by-time.\n\
    \   This is done by adding the by-time upon receipt to the current\n   locale-specific\
    \ time and thereby arriving at a locale-specific\n   absolute time which is by-time\
    \ seconds in the future or past,\n   depending upon the arithmetic sign of by-time.\
    \  The message is then\n   to be delivered by the deliver-by-time.  The sending\
    \ client and\n   receiving server should assume the transmission time of the MAIL\
    \ FROM\n   command to be instantaneous.  Clearly, it will not be and network\n\
    \   latency will introduce an error, the nature of which will be to\n   extend\
    \ slightly the effective by-time. The more hops the message\n   takes, the more\
    \ pronounced the effect will be owing to the cumulative\n   nature of this latency-induced\
    \ error.\n   In the case of a by-mode of \"N\", it is possible that by-time may\
    \ be\n   zero or negative.  This is not an error and should not be rejected as\n\
    \   such.  It indicates a message for which the deliver-by-time occurred\n   -(by-time)\
    \ seconds in the past.  [Here, \"-(by-time)\" represents the\n   arithmetic negation\
    \ of the by-time value.]  Zero and negative values\n   are allowed so as to preserve\
    \ information about any requested\n   delivery time information -- information\
    \ which the delivering MTA may\n   wish to include with the delivered message\
    \ for the benefit of the\n   recipient or to show in a DSN or NDN (non delivery\
    \ notification).\n   In the case of a by-mode of \"R\", a zero or negative by-time\
    \ is a\n   syntax error. In such a case, the SMTP server SHOULD return a\n   permanent\
    \ failure (501) SMTP reply code in response to the extended\n   MAIL FROM command.\
    \  If the SMTP server also supports enhanced error\n   codes [8], then an enhanced\
    \ error code of 5.5.4 SHOULD also be\n   returned.\n   If the by-time is a valid\
    \ by-time specification but the SMTP server\n   cannot honor or accept it for\
    \ a server-specific reason, then SMTP\n   server SHOULD respond with either a\
    \ 455 SMTP response if the\n   condition is transient or a 555 SMTP response if\
    \ the condition is\n   permanent. In addition, if the SMTP server also supports\
    \ [8], a\n   suitable 4.X.X or 5.X.X enhanced error code SHOULD also be returned.\n"

  - "6.  Examples\n   In the following sample SMTP dialog, the SMTP client requests\
    \ that a\n   message from <eljefe@bigbiz.com> be delivered to\n   <topbanana@other.com>\
    \ within 2 minutes (120 seconds) and returned\n   otherwise.  This request takes\
    \ the form of a BY parameter on the MAIL\n   FROM line of \"BY=120;R\" as shown\
    \ below:\n     S: 220 acme.net SMTP server here\n     C: EHLO bigbiz.com\n   \
    \  S: 250-acme.net\n     S: 250 DELIVERBY\n     C: MAIL FROM:<eljefe@bigbiz.com>\

    \     S: 250 <topbanana@wherever.com> recipient ok\n   Suppose now that the receiving\
    \ SMTP server in the above example needs\n   to relay the message to another SMTP\
    \ server, mail.other.com.  Owing\n   to the original by-mode of \"R\", the message\
    \ may only be relayed to\n   another SMTP server which supports the Deliver By\
    \ extension (Section\n   4.1.4).  Further, when relaying the message, the Deliver\
    \ By request\n   must be relayed.  With this in mind, consider the following SMTP\n\

    \ EHLO acme.net\n     S: 250-mail.other.com\n     S: 250 DELIVERBY 240\n     C:\
    \ QUIT\n   In the above dialog, the relaying SMTP server, acme.net, connects to\n\
    \   mail.other.com and issues an EHLO command.  It then learns that the\n   Deliver\
    \ By extension is supported but that the minimum by-time for a\n   by-mode of\
    \ \"R\" is 4 minutes (240 seconds).  This value exceeds the\n   message's original\
    \ by-time and therefore necessarily exceeds the\n   remaining by-time.  The relaying\
    \ SMTP server thus ends the SMTP\n   session after which it must either attempt\
    \ to follow any other MX\n   records or, if there are no more MX records to follow,\
    \ must return\n   the message as undeliverable.  Similar behavior would result\
    \ if the\n   EHLO command was met with an error or did not include the DELIVERBY\n\
    \   keyword.\n   Consider instead, the relaying SMTP session:\n     S: 220 mail.other.com\
    \ ESMTP server at your service\n     C: EHLO acme.net\n     S: 250-mail.other.com\n\
    \     S: 250 DELIVERBY 30\n     C: MAIL FROM:<eljefe@bigbiz.com> BY=98;R\n   \
    \  S: 250 <eljefe@bigbiz.com> Sender okay\n     C: RCPT TO:<topbanana@other.com>\n\
    \     S: 250 <topbanana@wherever.com> Recipient okay\n   In the above, the relaying\
    \ SMTP client relays the BY parameter with\n   the by-mode preserved and the by-time\
    \ computed to be the remaining\n   number of seconds at the approximate time that\
    \ the MAIL FROM command\n   was transmitted from the relaying SMTP client (acme.net)\
    \ to the\n   receiving SMTP server (mail.other.com).  In this example, 22 seconds\n\
    \   have elapsed since acme.net received the MAIL FROM line from the\n   original\
    \ sending client and relayed the Deliver By request to\n   mail.other.com.\n"

  - "7.  MX based relaying considerations\n   Sites which wish to use the Deliver\
    \ By SMTP service extension and\n   which direct their mail via MX records [9]\
    \ need to ensure that all of\n   their MX hosts -- hosts to which their mail is\
    \ directed by MX records\n   -- support the Deliver By extension. SMTP clients\
    \ which support\n   Deliver By SHOULD NOT attempt multiple MX hosts looking for\
    \ one which\n   supports Deliver By.\n   MX hosts should pay careful attention\
    \ to the min-by-time value they\n   present in response to EHLO commands.  It\
    \ is not practical for an MX\n   host to present a value which either (1) is substantially\
    \ different\n   from that which can be handled by the destination host to which\
    \ it\n   relays, or (2) doesn't recognize normal delivery latencies introduced\n\
    \   when the MX host relays mail to the destination host.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   Implemention of Deliver By allows tracing of\
    \ a mail transport system.\n   The by-trace field \"T\" explicitly requests that\
    \ a trace be generated.\n   Moreover, even when the by-trace field is not used,\
    \ a crude trace may\n   be generated by entering a series of messages into the\
    \ transport\n   system, each with successively increasing by-time values; e.g.,\n\
    \   \"BY=0;R\", \"BY=1;R\", \"BY=2;R\". Probing, and in some cases tracing, can\n\
    \   be accomplished through other means: querying the visible SMTP\n   servers,\
    \ investigating Received: header lines in bounced messages,\n   and using utilities\
    \ such as \"traceroute\".\n"
- title: 9.  Other Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Other Considerations\n   SMTP servers which support the Deliver By SMTP service\
    \ extension as\n   well as their associated MTAs are not required to assign any\
    \ special\n   processing priority to messages with Deliver By requests.  Of course,\n\
    \   some SMTP servers and MTAs may do so if they desire.  Moreover,\n   delivery\
    \ status notifications generated in response to messages with\n   Deliver By requests\
    \ are not required to receive any special\n   processing.  Consequently, users\
    \ of this service should not, in\n   general, expect expedited processing of their\
    \ messages.  Moreover,\n   just because a message is sent with a \"BY=60;R\" parameter\
    \ does not\n   guarantee that the sender will learn of a delivery failure within\
    \ any\n   specified time period as the DSN will not necessarily be expedited\n\
    \   back to sender.\n"
