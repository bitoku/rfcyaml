    \ broadcast / multicast-\n   capable switched LAN environment using SONET/SDH\
    \ lines as\n   transmission media.  Possible configurations of MAPOS system are\n\
    \   shown in the following diagrams.  In (a), two end nodes are connected\n  \
    \ to each other.  Figure (b) shows a star-topology \"SONET-LAN\" where\n   multiple\

    \ cluster configuration\n                   Figure 1. Possible configurations\n\
    \   Each port on a switch has an unique identifier within the switch. A\n   node\
    \ connected to a switch port must inherit the address of the port.\n   That is,\
    \ the node address is equal to the port identifier and is\n   unique within the\
    \ switch.\n   In a switch cluster, a node address is subnetted. The high-order\n\
    \   bits, the part where the corresponding bits in the \"subnet mask\" are\n \
    \  1, indicate the switch address.  The remaining low-order bits\n   indicate\
    \ the unique node address within the switch. The two fields\n   form an unique\
    \ address for a given node.\n   In either case, the address may be configured\
    \ manually into a node\n   interface, or automatically by the address assignment\
    \ mechanism\n   described in [5].\n   Note that any two components may be connected\
    \ either directly, or via\n   a long-haul SONET/SDH leased line.\n"
- title: 1.3 Packet Transmission
  contents:
  - "1.3 Packet Transmission\n   The protocol is connection-less -- when a node wish\
    \ to communicate\n   with some other node, it simply fills-in the destination\
    \ address of\n   an HDLC frame, places it in one or more SONET/SDH payloads, and\
    \ sends\n   it over a SONET/SDH link.\n   The switch forwards the frame to its\
    \ destination based on the\n   destination address. In a switch cluster, the frame\
    \ may be forwarded\n   by multiple switches and is eventually delivered to the\
    \ specified\n   node.  Broadcast and multicast are also supported. Frames with\
    \ an\n   invalid destination address are silently discarded.\n   Like ethernet,\
    \ the multiple access capability is provided by a switch\n   or a switch cluster.\
    \ Since MAPOS is a link layer protocol, it is\n   independent of the upper layer\
    \ protocols. That is, it can support any\n   network layer protocols such as IP.\
    \ MAPOS IPv4 support is described\n   in [6].\n"
- title: 2. Physical Layer
  contents:
  - "2. Physical Layer\n   This protocol treats the underlying end-to-end SONET/SDH\
    \ transmission\n   link as if it was a plain, transparent channel.  It sends HDLC\
    \ frames\n   in SONET/SDH payloads, and expects them to arrive at the other end\n\
    \   unaltered.\n   Each node and switch should terminate SONET/SDH overhead such\
    \ as\n   section overhead, line overhead, and path overhead according to the\n\
    \   specification of SONET/SDH. Unfortunately, SONET and SDH overhead\n   interpretations\
    \ are not identical. In addition, some SONET/SDH\n   implementations utilize some\
    \ overhead bytes in proprietary manner.\n   The detail of the interpretation is\
    \ beyond the scope of this\n   document.  Appendix A describes some of the most\
    \ significant\n   differences among SONET, SDH, and their implementations that\
    \ often\n   causes interoperability problems.  Implementors of SONET/SDH\n   interfaces\
    \ are strongly encouraged to be aware of such differences,\n   and provide workaround\
    \ options in their products.\n"

    \                        Figure 2.  Frame format\n     Flag Sequence\n     Flag\
    \ sequence is used for frame synchronization.  Each frame begins\n     and ends\
    \ with a flag sequence 01111110 (0x7E).  If a frame\n     immediately follows\
    \ another, one flag sequence may be treated as\n     the end of the preceding\
    \ frame and the beginning of the immediately\n     following frame.  When the\
    \ line is idle, the flag sequence is to be\n     transmitted continuously on the\
    \ line.\n     Address\n     The address field contains the destination HDLC address.\
    \  A frame\n     is forwarded by a switch based on this field.  It is 8 bits wide.\n\
    \     The LSB indicates the end of this field, and must always be 1.  The\n  \
    \   MSB is used to indicate if the frame is a unicast or a multicast\n     frame.\
    \  The MSB of 0 means unicast, with the remaining six bits\n     indicating the\
    \ destination node address. MSB of 1 means multicast,\n     with the remaining\
    \ six bits indicating the group address.  The\n     address 11111111 (0xFF) means\
    \ that the frame is a broadcast frame.\n     The address 00000001 (0x01) is reserved\

    \ contains single octet 00000011 (0x03) which, in\n     HDLC nomenclature, means\
    \ that the frame is an Unnumbered\n     Information (UI) with the Poll/Final (P/F)\
    \ bit set to zero.  Frames\n     with any other control field values should be\
    \ silently discarded.\n     Protocol\n     The protocol field indicates the protocol\
    \ to which the datagram\n     encapsulated in the information field belongs. \
    \ It conforms to the\n     ISO 3309 extension mechanism, and the value for this\
    \ field may be\n     obtained from the most recent \"Assigned Numbers\" [8] and\
    \ \"MAPOS\n     Version 1 Assigned Numbers\" [9].\n     Information\n     The\
    \ information field contains the datagram for the protocol\n     specified in\
    \ the protocol field.  The length of this field may\n     vary, but shall not\
    \ exceed 65,280 (64K - 256) octets.\n     Frame Check Sequence (FCS)\n     By\
    \ default, the frame check sequence (FCS) field is 16-bits long.\n     Optionally,\
    \ 32 bit FCS may be used instead.  The FCS is calculated\n     over all bits of\
    \ the address, control, protocol, and information\n     fields prior to escape\
    \ conversions.  The least significant octet of\n     the result is transmitted\
    \ first as it contains the coefficient of\n     the highest term.\n     Inter-frame\
    \ fill\n     A sending station must continuously transmit the flag sequence as\n\
    \     inter-frame fill after the FCS field.  The inter-frame flag\n     sequences\
    \ must be silently discarded by the receiving station.\n     When an under-run\
    \ occurs during DMA in the sending station, it must\n     abort the frame transfer\
    \ and continuously send the flag sequence to\n     indicate the error.\n"
- title: 3.2 Octet-Synchronous Framing
  contents:
  - "3.2 Octet-Synchronous Framing\n   MAPOS uses an octet stuffing procedure because\
    \ it treats SONET/SDH as\n   a byte-oriented synchronous link.  Since SONET/SDH\
    \ provides\n   transparency, Async-Control-Character-Map (ACCM) is not used. \
    \ HDLC\n   frames are mapped into the SONET/SDH payload as follows.\n   Each HDLC\
    \ frame is separated from another frame by one or more flag\n   sequence, 01111110\
    \ (0x7E).  An escape sequence is defined to escape\n   the flag sequence and itself.\
    \  Prior to sending the frame, but after\n   the FCS computation, every occurrence\
    \ of 01111110 (0x7E) other than\n   the flags is to be converted to the sequence\
    \ 01111101 01011110 (0x7D\n   0x5E), and the sequence 01111101 (0x7D) is to be\
    \ converted to the\n   sequence 01111101 01011101 (0x7D 0x5D).  Upon receiving\
    \ a frame, this\n   conversion must be reversed prior to FCS computation.\n"

  contents:
  - "APPENDIX A.  Differences among SONET, SDH, and their Implementations\n   This\
    \ section briefly describes the major differences among SONET\n   which is an\
    \ ANSI standard, SDH, an ITU-T standard, and their\n   implementations.\n    \
    \ AU pointer (H1, H2, H3)\n     The AU pointer consists of bytes H1, H2, and H3.\
    \ The bits 5 and 6\n     of the H1 byte are called \"SS bits,\" and are used to\
    \ indicate the\n     offset into the payload where the beginning of a SPE is located.\n\
    \     (Note that \"SPE\" is a SONET term -- SDH calls it \"VC.\")  In the\n  \
    \   case of OC-3c, SONET sets the SS bits of the second and the third\n     H1\
    \ bytes to 0, whereas SDH sets them to 10 for AU-4, and 01 for\n     AU-31.  Although\
    \ the SS bits may be ignored at the receiving\n     station, some transmission\
    \ systems discards SONET/SDH frames with\n     SS bits that it doesn't expect\
    \ -- the sending station should be\n     aware of this, and include a configuration\
    \ option to handle it.\n     Z1 and Z2\n     The Z bytes are reserved in SONET/SDH.\
    \  Some transmission systems,\n     however, use them in a proprietary manner.\
    \  SONET uses Z1 for Line\n     Error Monitoring.  NTT, a carrier in Japan, utilized\
    \ Z1 for\n     Automatic Protection Switching (APS.)\n     DCC Bytes\n     The\
    \ D bytes are called the Data Communication channel (DCC), and\n     are defined\
    \ for maintenance and operations.  However, some carriers\n     and vendors use\
    \ them in a proprietary manner.  For example, NTT's\n     STM-1 UNI uses the D4,\
    \ D5, and D6 bytes to transfer section and\n     path maintenance information.\n"
