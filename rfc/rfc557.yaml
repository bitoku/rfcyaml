  - "                REVELATIONS IN NETWORK HOST MEASUREMENTS\n   The purpose of RFC\
    \ 392 was to identify a problem we had encountered\n   in using the ARPANET at\
    \ Utah.  The primary thrust of the paper was\n   supposed to be: \"Here is a place\
    \ to make the Network better\" rather\n   than: \"Look, isn't the Network terrible.\"\
    \  The accepted use of 392\n   seems to be the latter rather than the former.\
    \  A second purpose of\n   392 was to stimulate the undertaking of measurement\
    \ experiments on\n   other computers and operating systems in addition to TENEX.\
    \  Very\n   little in the way of measurements has been reported (other than Hal\n\
    \   Murray's RFC 415 measuring TENEX).\n   Since the Publication of RFC 392, BBN\
    \ has done a considerable amount\n   of work to improve Host-Net performance on\
    \ TENEX.  They reported new\n   measurement results in their April 1973 Quarterly\
    \ Progress Report No.\n   10.  I feel it is important to circulate those results\
    \ to the RFC\n   community.\n   Don Allen at BBN borrowed Greg Hicks' RJS program\
    \ and 1) updated it\n   to take advantage of recent changes in TENEX, 2) improved\
    \ the code\n   near the input/output JSYs and 3) used considerably faster network\n\
    \   monitor code.  The result was approximately 400% improvement from\n   75-85\
    \ seconds of CPU time per megabit (~$10) to 19 seconds per\n   megabit (~$2.50).\
    \  Of the 19 seconds, 13 were spent in the RJS\n   program and 6 in TENEX network\
    \ output.  The six seconds seem to\n   relate very well to BBN FTP requirements\
    \ where 8.2 cpu seconds per\n   megabit were required (~$1.08) for 8 bit byte\
    \ transfers.  (Going to\n   32 or 36 bit bytes improves this figure by a factor\
    \ of 4, resulting\n   in a cost of $.33 per megabit.)\n   Of the 13 seconds left\
    \ in RJS no attempt was made to improve or even\n   discover where the time was\
    \ spent.  This extra effort was not\n   expended because RJS is soon to be replaced\
    \ by the RJE protocol which\n   uses FTP as its transfer mechanism.\n   In summary,\
    \ I believe that the original RFC #392 and the recent BBN\n   results show that\
    \ the Network including the Host cost, is\n   intrinsically effective.  If care\
    \ is not taken in monitor and user\n   code the system may not look very attractive.\
    \  I hope everyone now\n   goes out and measures how good (or bad) they are doing\
    \ vis a vis\n   network transfers.  Please send me the results personally if they\
    \ are\n   too embarrassing to distribute via RFC.  It would be nice to hear\n\
    \   from all systems.\n   All the data is courtesy of Don Allen and Jerry Burchfiel\
    \ at BNN.\n         [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n\
