This memo is a policy statement on the implementation of the Domain Style Naming System in the Internet.
This memo is a partial update of RFC 881.
The intent of this memo is to detail the schedule for the implementation for the Domain Style Naming System.
The names of hosts will be changed to domain style names.
Hosts will begin to use domain style names on 14 Mar 84, and the use of old style names will be completely phased out before 2 May 84.
This applies to both the ARPA research hosts and the DDN operational hosts.
This is an official policy statement of the ICCB and the DARPA.

This memo is a policy statement on the implementation of the Exterior Gateway Protocol in the Internet.
This is an official policy statement of ICCB and DARPA.
After 1 Aug 84 there shall be no dumb gateways in the Internet.
Every gateway must be a member of some autonomous system.
Some gateway of each autonomous system must exchange routing information with some gateway of the core autonomous system using the Exterior Gateway Protocol.
This memo is both a status report on the Internet and advice to TCP implementers.
This RFC describes the Exterior Gateway Protocol used to connect Stub Gateways to an Autonomous System of core Gateways.
This document specifies the working protocol, and defines an ARPA official protocol.
All implementers of Gateways should carefully review this document.

This RFC defines the standard format for interchange of Network News articles among USENET sites.
It describes the format for articles themselves, and gives partial standards for transmission of news.
The news transmission is not entirely standardized in order to give a good deal of flexibility to the individual hosts to choose transmission hardware and software, whether to batch news and so on.
This RFC actually is a request for comments.
The issue dealt with is that of a naming registry update procedure, both as exists currently and what could exist in the future.
None of the proposed solutions are intended as standards at this time; rather it is hoped that a general consensus will emerge as the appropriate solution, leaving eventually to the adoption of standards.

This RFC is a status report on the Internet Gateway developed by BBN.
It describes the Internet Gateway as of September 1982.
This memo presents detailed descriptions of message formats and gateway procedures, however, this is not an implementation specification, and such details are subject to change.
This document revises the specifications in RFC 733, in order to serve the needs of the larger and more complex ARPA Internet.
Some of RFC 733's features failed to gain adequate acceptance.
In order to simplify the standard and the software that follows it, these features have been removed.
A different addressing scheme is used, to handle the case of internetwork mail; and the concept of re transmission has been introduced.
Obsoletes RFC 733, NIC 41952.
The objective of Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is to transfer mail reliably and efficiently.
SMTP is independent of the particular transmission subsystem and requires only a reliable ordered data stream channel.

This RFC describes an alternate approach of dealing with reassembly which reduces the bookkeeping problem to a minimum, and requires only one buffer for storage equal in size to the final datagram being reassembled, which can reassemble a datagram from any number of fragments arriving in any order with any possible pattern of overlap and duplication, and which is appropriate for almost any sort of operating system.
This RFC describes implementation strategies to deal with two mechanisms in TCP, the window and the acknowledgement.
It also presents a particular set of algorithms which have received testing in the field, and which appear to work properly with each other.
With more experience, these algorithms may become part of the formal specification, until such time their use is recommended.

This is the CCITT standard for group 3 facsimile encoding.
This is useful for data compression of bit map data.
The first part of this RFC describes in detail the Dacom 450 data compression algorithms and is an update and correction to an earlier memorandum.
The second part of this RFC describes briefly the Dacom 500 data compression algorithm as used by the INTELPOST electronic mail network under development by the US Postal Service and several foreign administrators.
The ARPANET 1822L Host Access Protocol
This document proposed two major changes to the current ARPANET host access protocol.
The first change will allow hosts to use logical addressing (i.e., host addresses that are independent of their physical location on the ARPANET) to communicate with each other, and the second will allow a host to shorten the amount of time that it may be blocked by its IMP after it presents a message to the network (currently, the IMP can block further input from a host for up to 15 seconds).
See RFCs 852 and 851.
This RFC discusses the conversion of hosts from NCP to TCP.
And making available the principle services:  Telnet, File Transfer, and Mail.
These protocols allow all hosts in the ARPA community to share a common interprocess communication environment.
