  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   As discussed in the BFCP (Binary Floor Control Protocol)\n\
    \   specification [8], a given BFCP client needs a set of data in order\n   to\
    \ establish a BFCP connection to a floor control server.  These data\n   include\
    \ the transport address of the server, the conference\n   identifier, and the\
    \ user identifier.\n   One way for clients to obtain this information is to use\
    \ an\n   offer/answer [4] exchange.  This document specifies how to encode\n \
    \  this information in the SDP session descriptions that are part of\n   such\
    \ an offer/answer exchange.\n   User agents typically use the offer/answer model\
    \ to establish a\n   number of media streams of different types.  Following this\
    \ model, a\n   BFCP connection is described as any other media stream by using\
    \ an\n   SDP 'm' line, possibly followed by a number of attributes encoded in\n\
    \   'a' lines.\n"

- title: 3.  Fields in the 'm' Line
  contents:
  - "3.  Fields in the 'm' Line\n   This section describes how to generate an 'm'\
    \ line for a BFCP stream.\n   According to the SDP specification [11], the 'm'\
    \ line format is the\n   following:\n      m=<media> <port> <transport> <fmt>\
    \ ...\n   The media field MUST have a value of \"application\".\n   The port field\
    \ is set following the rules in [7].  Depending on the\n   value of the 'setup'\
    \ attribute (discussed in Section 7), the port\n   field contains the port to\
    \ which the remote endpoint will initiate\n   its TCP connection or is irrelevant\
    \ (i.e., the endpoint will initiate\n   the connection towards the remote endpoint)\
    \ and should be set to a\n   value of 9, which is the discard port.  Since BFCP\
    \ only runs on top\n   of TCP, the port is always a TCP port.  A port field value\
    \ of zero\n   has the standard SDP meaning (i.e., rejection of the media stream).\n\
    \   We define two new values for the transport field: TCP/BFCP and\n   TCP/TLS/BFCP.\
    \  The former is used when BFCP runs directly on top of\n   TCP, and the latter\
    \ is used when BFCP runs on top of TLS, which in\n   turn runs on top of TCP.\n\
    \   The fmt (format) list is ignored for BFCP.  The fmt list of BFCP 'm'\n   lines\
    \ SHOULD contain a single \"*\" character.\n   The following is an example of\
    \ an 'm' line for a BFCP connection:\n      m=application 50000 TCP/TLS/BFCP *\n"
- title: 4.  Floor Control Server Determination
  contents:
  - "4.  Floor Control Server Determination\n   When two endpoints establish a BFCP\
    \ stream, they need to determine\n   which of them acts as a floor control server.\
    \  In the most common\n   scenario, a client establishes a BFCP stream with a\
    \ conference server\n   that acts as the floor control server.  Floor control\
    \ server\n   determination is straight forward because one endpoint can only act\n\
    \   as a client and the other can only act as a floor control server.\n   However,\
    \ there are scenarios where both endpoints could act as a\n   floor control server.\
    \  For example, in a two-party session that\n   involves an audio stream and a\
    \ shared whiteboard, the endpoints need\n   to decide which party will be acting\
    \ as the floor control server.\n   Furthermore, there are situations where both\
    \ the offerer and the\n   answerer act as both clients and floor control servers\
    \ in the same\n   session.  For example, in a two-party session that involves\
    \ an audio\n   stream and a shared whiteboard, one party acts as the floor control\n\
    \   server for the audio stream and the other acts as the floor control\n   server\
    \ for the shared whiteboard.\n   We define the 'floorctrl' SDP media-level attribute\
    \ to perform floor\n   control determination.  Its Augmented BNF syntax [2] is:\n\
    \   floor-control-attribute  = \"a=floorctrl:\" role *(SP role)\n   role     \
    \                = \"c-only\" / \"s-only\" / \"c-s\"\n   The offerer includes\
    \ this attribute to state all the roles it would\n   be willing to perform:\n\
    \   c-only:  The offerer would be willing to act as a floor control\n      client\
    \ only.\n   s-only:  The offerer would be willing to act as a floor control\n\
    \      server only.\n   c-s:  The offerer would be willing to act both as a floor\
    \ control\n      client and as a floor control server.\n   If an 'm' line in an\
    \ offer contains a 'floorctrl' attribute, the\n   answerer MUST include one in\
    \ the corresponding 'm' line in the\n   answer.  The answerer includes this attribute\
    \ to state which role the\n   answerer will perform.  That is, the answerer chooses\
    \ one of the\n   roles the offerer is willing to perform and generates an answer\
    \ with\n   the corresponding role for the answerer.  Table 1 shows the\n   corresponding\
    \ roles for an answerer, depending on the offerer's role.\n                  \
    \        +---------+----------+\n                          | Offerer | Answerer\
    \ |\n                          +---------+----------+\n                      \
    \    |  c-only |  s-only  |\n                          |  s-only |  c-only  |\n\
    \                          |   c-s   |    c-s   |\n                          +---------+----------+\n\
    \                              Table 1: Roles\n   The following are the descriptions\
    \ of the roles when they are chosen\n   by an answerer:\n   c-only:  The answerer\
    \ will act as a floor control client.\n      Consequently, the offerer will act\
    \ as a floor control server.\n   s-only:  The answerer will act as a floor control\
    \ server.\n      Consequently, the offerer will act as a floor control client.\n\
    \   c-s:  The answerer will act both as a floor control client and as a\n    \
    \  floor control server.  Consequently, the offerer will also act\n      both\
    \ as a floor control client and as a floor control server.\n   Endpoints that\
    \ use the offer/answer model to establish BFCP\n   connections MUST support the\
    \ 'floorctrl' attribute.  A floor control\n   server acting as an offerer or as\
    \ an answerer SHOULD include this\n   attribute in its session descriptions.\n\
    \   If the 'floorctrl' attribute is not used in an offer/answer exchange,\n  \
    \ by default the offerer and the answerer will act as a floor control\n   client\
    \ and as a floor control server, respectively.\n   The following is an example\
    \ of a 'floorctrl' attribute in an offer.\n   When this attribute appears in an\
    \ answer, it only carries one role:\n      a=floorctrl:c-only s-only c-s\n"

    \  Their\n   Augmented BNF syntax [2] is:\n   confid-attribute      = \"a=confid:\"\

    \ is used in BFCP 'm' lines.  It defines a\n   floor identifier and, possibly,\
    \ associates it with one or more media\n   streams.  The token representing the\
    \ floor ID is the integer\n   representation of the Floor ID to be used in BFCP.\
    \  The token\n   representing the media stream is a pointer to the media stream,\
    \ which\n   is identified by an SDP label attribute [9].\n   Endpoints that use\
    \ the offer/answer model to establish BFCP\n   connections MUST support the 'floorid'\
    \ and the 'label' attributes.  A\n   floor control server acting as an offerer\

- title: 7.  TCP Connection Management
  contents:
  - "7.  TCP Connection Management\n   The management of the TCP connection used to\
    \ transport BFCP is\n   performed using the 'setup' and 'connection' attributes,\
    \ as defined\n   in [7].\n   The 'setup' attribute indicates which of the endpoints\
    \ (client or\n   floor control server) initiates the TCP connection.  The 'connection'\n\
    \   attribute handles TCP connection reestablishment.\n   The BFCP specification\
    \ [8] describes a number of situations when the\n   TCP connection between a client\
    \ and the floor control server needs to\n   be reestablished.  However, that specification\
    \ does not describe the\n   reestablishment process because this process depends\
    \ on how the\n   connection was established in the first place.  BFCP entities\
    \ using\n   the offer/answer model follow the following rules.\n   When the existing\
    \ TCP connection is reset following the rules in [8],\n   the client SHOULD generate\
    \ an offer towards the floor control server\n   in order to reestablish the connection.\
    \  If a TCP connection cannot\n   deliver a BFCP message and times out, the entity\
    \ that attempted to\n   send the message (i.e., the one that detected the TCP\
    \ timeout) SHOULD\n   generate an offer in order to reestablish the TCP connection.\n\
    \   Endpoints that use the offer/answer model to establish BFCP\n   connections\
    \ MUST support the 'setup' and 'connection' attributes.\n"
- title: 8.  Authentication
  contents:
  - "8.  Authentication\n   When a BFCP connection is established using the offer/answer\
    \ model,\n   it is assumed that the offerer and the answerer authenticate each\n\
    \   other using some mechanism.  Once this mutual authentication takes\n   place,\
    \ all the offerer and the answerer need to ensure is that the\n   entity they\
    \ are receiving BFCP messages from is the same as the one\n   that generated the\
    \ previous offer or answer.\n   When SIP is used to perform an offer/answer exchange,\
    \ the initial\n   mutual authentication takes place at the SIP level.  Additionally,\n\
    \   SIP uses S/MIME [6] to provide an integrity-protected channel with\n   optional\
    \ confidentiality for the offer/answer exchange.  BFCP takes\n   advantage of\
    \ this integrity-protected offer/answer exchange to\n   perform authentication.\
    \  Within the offer/answer exchange, the\n   offerer and answerer exchange the\
    \ fingerprints of their self-signed\n   certificates.  These self-signed certificates\
    \ are then used to\n   establish the TLS connection that will carry BFCP traffic\
    \ between the\n   offerer and the answerer.\n   BFCP clients and floor control\
    \ servers follow the rules in [10]\n   regarding certificate choice and presentation.\
    \  This implies that\n   unless a 'fingerprint' attribute is included in the session\n\
    \   description, the certificate provided at the TLS-level MUST either be\n  \
    \ directly signed by one of the other party's trust anchors or be\n   validated\
    \ using a certification path that terminates at one of the\n   other party's trust\
    \ anchors [5].  Endpoints that use the offer/answer\n   model to establish BFCP\
    \ connections MUST support the 'fingerprint'\n   attribute and SHOULD include\
    \ it in their session descriptions.\n   When TLS is used, once the underlaying\
    \ TCP connection is established,\n   the answerer acts as the TLS server regardless\
    \ of its role (passive\n   or active) in the TCP establishment procedure.\n"
