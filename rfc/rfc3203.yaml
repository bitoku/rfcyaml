  - "Abstract\n   This document defines extensions to DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration\n
    \  Protocol) to allow dynamic reconfiguration of a single host triggered\n   by
    the DHCP server (e.g., a new IP address and/or local configuration\n   parameters).
    \ This is achieved by introducing a unicast FORCERENEW\n   message which forces
    the client to the RENEW state.  The behaviour\n   for hosts using the DHCP INFORM
    message to obtain configuration\n   information is also described.\n"

  title: 2.1 Terminology
- contents:
  - "2.2 Force renew procedures\n   The DHCP server sends a unicast FORCERENEW message
    to the client.\n   Upon receipt of the unicast FORCERENEW message, the client
    will\n   change its state to the RENEW state, and will then try to renew its\n
    \  lease according to normal DHCP procedures.  If the server wants to\n   assign
    a new IP address to the client, it will reply to the DHCP\n   REQUEST with a DHCP
    NAK.  The client will then go back to the init\n   state and broadcast a DHCP
    DISCOVER message.  The server can now\n   assign a new IP address to the client
    by replying with a DHCP OFFER.\n   If the FORCERENEW message is lost, the DHCP
    server will not receive a\n   DHCP REQUEST from the client and it should retransmit
    the FORCERENEW\n   message using an exponential backoff algorithm.  Depending
    on the\n   bandwidth of the network between server and client, the server should\n
    \  choose a delay.  This delay grows exponentially as retransmissions\n   fail.
    \ The amount of retransmissions should be limited.\n   The procedures described
    above assume the server to send a unicast\n   FORCERENEW message to the client.
    \ Receipt of a multicast FORCERENEW\n   message by the client should be silently
    discarded.\n   It can be that a client has obtained a network address through
    some\n   other means (e.g., manual configuration) and has used a DHCP INFORM\n
    \  request to obtain other local configuration parameters.  Such clients\n   should
    respond to the receipt of a unicast FORCERENEW message with a\n   new DHCP INFORM
    request so as to obtain a potential new set of local\n   configuration parameters.
    \ Note that the usage of these procedures\n   are limited to the set of options
    that are eligible for configuration\n   by DHCP and should not override manually
    configured parameters.\n   Note further that usage of the FORCERENEW message to
    reconfigure a\n   client address or local configuration parameters can lead to
    the\n   interruption of active sessions, and that as such these  procedures\n
    \  should be used in controlled circumstances.\n"

  title: 2.3 Example usage
- contents:
  - "2.3.1 Embedded DHCP clients\n   The autoconfiguration of home gateways (more
    generically Network\n   Termination equipment) for public networking purposes
    can be achieved\n   through means of DHCP, as described in [DSL_autoconf].  In
    order to\n   allow service changes or service interruption, the FORCERENEW message\n
    \  can trigger the home gateway to contact the DHCP server, prior to the\n   expiry
    of the lease.\n"

  - "2.3.2 Hospitality service scenario\n   In self provisioned networks, e.g., hotel
    rooms, the hotel owned DHCP\n   server can hand out limited use IP addresses,
    that allows the\n   customer to consume local services or select external services
    from a\n   web browser interface.  In order to allow external services through\n
    \  other service providers, e.g., global internet services or enterprise\n   VPN
    services, the DHCP server can trigger the client to ask for a new\n   DHCP initialization
    session so as to obtain e.g., a globally routed\n   IP address.\n"

  - "2.3.3 Network renumbering\n   Under tightly controlled conditions, the FORCERENEW
    procedures can be\n   used to brute force the renumbering of entire subnets, client
    per\n   client, under control of a DHCP server.\n"

  - "2.4 Rationale\n   The approach as described in this document has a number of\n
    \  advantages.  It does not require new states to be added to the DHCP\n   client
    implementation.  This minimizes the amount of code to be\n   changed.  It also
    allows lease RENEWAL to be driven by the server,\n   which can be used to optimize
    network usage or DHCP server load.\n"
