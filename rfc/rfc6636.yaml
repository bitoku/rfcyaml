  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) [1] for IPv4\
    \ and the\n   Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) [2] protocol for IPv6 are the\n\
    \   standard protocols for hosts to initiate joining or leaving of\n   multicast\
    \ sessions.  These protocols must also be supported by\n   multicast routers or\
    \ IGMP/MLD proxies [5] that maintain multicast\n   membership information on their\
    \ downstream interfaces.  Conceptually,\n   IGMP and MLD work on both wireless\
    \ and mobile networks.  However,\n   wireless access technologies operate on a\
    \ shared medium or a point-\n   to-point link with limited spectrum and bandwidth.\
    \  In many wireless\n   regimes, it is desirable to minimize multicast-related\
    \ signaling to\n   preserve the limited resources of battery-powered mobile devices\
    \ and\n   the constrained transmission capacities of the networks.  The motion\n\
    \   of a host may cause disruption of multicast service initiation and\n   termination\
    \ in the new or previous network.  Slow multicast service\n   activation following\
    \ a join may incur additional delay in receiving\n   multicast packets and degrade\
    \ reception quality.  Slow service\n   termination triggered by a rapid departure\
    \ of the mobile host without\n   first leaving the group in the previous network\
    \ may waste network\n   resources.\n   When IGMP and MLD are used with mobile\
    \ IP protocols, the proximity of\n   network entities should be considered.  For\
    \ example, when a\n   bidirectional tunnel is used with the mobility entities\
    \ described in\n   [6] and [7], the mobile host experiences additional latency\
    \ because\n   the round-trip time using a bidirectional tunnel between mobility\n\
    \   entities is larger compared to the case where a host and an upstream\n   router\
    \ attach to a LAN.\n   This document describes ways to tune IGMPv3 and MLDv2 protocol\n\
    \   behavior -- on the multicast router and proxy side -- concentrating\n   in\
    \ particular on wireless and mobile networks, including the tuning\n   of queries\
    \ and related timers.  This selective optimization provides\n   tangible benefits\
    \ to mobile hosts and routers by keeping track of the\n   membership status of\
    \ downstream hosts, and of various IGMP/MLD Query\n   types and values, in order\
    \ to appropriately tune the number of\n   response messages.  This document does\
    \ not make any changes to the\n   IGMPv3 and MLDv2 protocols and only suggests\
    \ optimal settings for the\n   configurable parameters of the protocols in mobile\
    \ and wireless\n   environments.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   In this document, \"router\" means both a multicast router\
    \ and an IGMP/\n   MLD proxy.\n"
- title: 3.  Explicit Tracking of Membership Status
  contents:
  - "3.  Explicit Tracking of Membership Status\n   Mobile hosts use IGMP and MLD\
    \ to make a request to join or leave\n   multicast sessions.  When an adjacent\
    \ upstream router receives the\n   IGMP/MLD Report messages, it recognizes the\
    \ membership status on the\n   link.  To update the membership status reliably,\
    \ the router sends\n   IGMP/MLD Query messages periodically, and sends Group-Specific\
    \ and/or\n   Group-and-Source-Specific Queries when a member host reports its\n\
    \   leave.  An IGMP/MLD Query is therefore necessary to obtain up-to-date\n  \
    \ membership information, but a large number of the reply messages sent\n   from\
    \ all member hosts may cause network congestion or consume network\n   bandwidth.\n\
    \   The \"explicit tracking function\" [8] is a possible approach to reduce\n\
    \   the transmitted number of IGMP/MLD messages and contribute to the\n   efficiency\
    \ of mobile communications.  It enables the router to keep\n   track of the membership\
    \ status of the downstream IGMPv3 or MLDv2\n   member hosts.  That is, if a router\
    \ enables the explicit tracking\n   function, it does not always need to request\
    \ transmission of a\n   Current-State Report message from the receiver hosts,\
    \ since the\n   router implicitly recognizes the (potential) last member host\
    \ when it\n   receives the State-Change Report message reporting a leave.  The\n\
    \   router can therefore send IGMP/MLD Group-Specific and Group-and-\n   Source-Specific\
    \ Queries LMQC/LLQC times (see Section 4.3) only when\n   it recognizes that the\
    \ last member has left the network.  This\n   reduces the transmitted number of\
    \ Current-State Report messages.\n   Enabling the explicit tracking function is\
    \ advantageous for mobile\n   multicast, but the function requires additional\
    \ processing capability\n   and, possibly, substantial memory for routers to store\
    \ all membership\n   status information.  This resource requirement is potentially\n\
    \   impacted, especially when a router needs to maintain a large number\n   of\
    \ receiver hosts.  Therefore, this document recommends that adjacent\n   upstream\
    \ multicast routers enable the explicit tracking function for\n   IP multicast\
    \ communications on wireless and mobile networks, if they\n   have enough resources.\
    \  If operators think that their routers do not\n   have enough resources, they\
    \ may disable this function on their\n   routers.  Note that whether or not routers\
    \ enable the explicit\n   tracking function, they need to maintain downstream\
    \ membership status\n   by sending IGMPv3/MLDv2 General Query messages, as some\
    \ IGMPv3/MLDv2\n   messages may be lost during transmission.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Tuning the IGMP/MLD General Query Interval\n   IGMP and MLD are unreliable\
    \ protocols; to cover the possibility of a\n   State-Change Report being missed\
    \ by one or more multicast routers,\n   hosts retransmit the same State-Change\
    \ Report messages ([Robustness\n   Variable] - 1) more times, at intervals chosen\
    \ at random from the\n   range (0, [Unsolicited Report Interval]) [1] [2].  Although\
    \ this\n   behavior increases the protocol's robustness, it does not guarantee\n\
    \   that the State-Change Report reaches the routers.  Therefore, routers\n  \
    \ still need to refresh their downstream membership information by\n   receiving\
    \ a Current-State Report, as periodically solicited by an\n   IGMP/MLD General\
    \ Query sent in the [Query Interval] period, in order\n   to enhance robustness\
    \ of the host in case of link failures and packet\n   loss.  This procedure also\
    \ supports situations where mobile hosts are\n   powered off or moved from one\
    \ network to another network managed by a\n   different router without any notification\
    \ (e.g., a leave request).\n   The [Query Interval] is the interval between General\
    \ Queries sent by\n   the regular IGMPv3/MLDv2 querier; the default value is 125\
    \ seconds\n   [1] [2].  By varying the [Query Interval], multicast routers can\
    \ tune\n   the number of IGMP/MLD messages on the network; larger values cause\n\
    \   IGMP/MLD Queries to be sent less often.\n   This document proposes a [Query\
    \ Interval] value of 150 seconds by\n   changing the Querier's Query Interval\
    \ Code (QQIC) field in the IGMP/\n   MLD Query message, for the case where a router\
    \ that enables the\n   explicit tracking function potentially operates a large\
    \ number of\n   member hosts, such as more than 200 hosts on the wireless link.\
    \  This\n   longer interval value contributes to minimizing Report message\n \
    \  traffic and battery-power consumption for mobile hosts.\n   On the other hand,\
    \ this document also proposes a [Query Interval]\n   value of 60 to 90 seconds\
    \ for the case where a router that enables\n   the explicit tracking function\
    \ attaches to a higher-capacity wireless\n   link.  This shorter interval contributes\
    \ to quick synchronization of\n   the membership information tracked by the router\
    \ but may consume\n   battery power on mobile hosts.\n   If a router does not\
    \ enable the explicit tracking function, the\n   [Query Interval] value would\
    \ be its default value -- 125 seconds.\n   In situations where Mobile IPv6 [7]\
    \ is used, when the home agent\n   implements multicast router functionality and\
    \ multicast data packets\n   are tunneled to and from the home agent, the home\
    \ agent may want to\n   increase the query interval.  This happens, for example,\
    \ when the\n   home agent detects network congestion.  In this case, the home\
    \ agent\n   starts forwarding queries with the default [Query Interval] value\
    \ and\n   increases the value in a gradual manner.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Tuning the IGMP/MLD Query Response Interval
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Tuning the IGMP/MLD Query Response Interval\n   The [Query Response Interval]\
    \ is the Max Response Time (or Max\n   Response Delay) used to calculate the Max\
    \ Resp Code inserted into the\n   periodic General Queries.  Its default value\
    \ is 10 seconds, expressed\n   as \"Max Resp Code=100\" for IGMPv3 [1] and \"\
    Maximum Response\n   Code=10000\" for MLDv2 [2].  By varying the [Query Response\
    \ Interval],\n   multicast routers can tune the burstiness of IGMP/MLD messages\
    \ on the\n   network; larger values make the traffic less bursty, as the hosts'\n\
    \   responses are spread out over a larger interval, but will increase\n   join\
    \ latency when a State-Change Report (i.e., join request) is\n   missing.\n  \
    \ According to our experimental analysis, this document proposes two\n   scenarios\
    \ for tuning the [Query Response Interval] value in different\n   wireless link\
    \ conditions: one scenario is for a wireless link with\n   lower resource capacity\
    \ or a lossy link, and the other scenario is\n   for a wireless link with enough\
    \ capacity or whose condition is\n   reliable enough for IGMP/MLD message transmission.\n\
    \   Regarding the first scenario, for instance, when a multicast router\n   attaches\
    \ to a bursty IEEE 802.11b link, the router configures a\n   longer [Query Response\
    \ Interval] value, such as 10 to 20 (seconds).\n   This configuration will reduce\
    \ congestion of the Current-State Report\n   messages on a link but may increase\
    \ join latency and leave latency\n   when the unsolicited messages (State-Change\
    \ Records) are lost on the\n   router.  Note that as defined in Section 4.1.1\
    \ of [1], in IGMPv3, a\n   Max Resp Code larger than 128 represents the exponential\
    \ values and\n   changes the granularity.  For example, if one wants to set the\
    \ Max\n   Response Time to 20.0 seconds, the Max Resp Code should be expressed\n\
    \   as \"0b10001001\", which is divided into \"mant=0b1001\" and \"exp=0b000\"\
    .\n   The second scenario may happen for a multicast router attaching to a\n \
    \  wireless link having higher resource capacity or to a point-to-\n   (multi-)point\
    \ link such as an IEEE 802.16e link because IGMP/MLD\n   messages do not seriously\
    \ affect the condition of the link.  The\n   router can seek Current-State Report\
    \ messages with a shorter [Query\n   Response Interval] value, such as 5 to 10\
    \ (seconds).  This\n   configuration will contribute to (at some level) quickly\
    \ discovering\n   non-tracked member hosts and synchronizing the membership\n\
    \   information.\n"

- title: 4.6.  Tuning Scenarios for Various Mobile IP Networks
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Tuning Scenarios for Various Mobile IP Networks\n   In mobile IP networks,\
    \ IGMP and MLD are used with three deployment\n   scenarios: (1) running directly\
    \ between a host and access router on a\n   wireless network, (2) running between\
    \ a host and home router through\n   a tunnel link, and (3) running between a\
    \ home router and foreign\n   router through a tunnel link.\n   When a receiver\
    \ host connects directly through a wireless link to a\n   foreign access router\
    \ or a home router, the tuning of the IGMP/MLD\n   protocol parameters should\
    \ be the same as suggested in the previous\n   sections.  The example of this\
    \ scenario occurs when in PMIPv6 [6],\n   the mobile access gateway, whose role\
    \ is similar to a foreign router,\n   acts as a multicast router or proxy.\n \
    \  The second scenario occurs when a bidirectional tunnel established\n   between\
    \ a host and home router is used to exchange IGMP/MLD messages\n   [7] [10]. \
    \ Tuning the parameters is difficult in this situation\n   because the condition\
    \ of the tunnel link is diverse and changeable.\n   When a host is far away from\
    \ the home router, the transmission delay\n   between the two entities may be\
    \ longer and the packet delivery may be\n   more unreliable.  Thus, the effects\
    \ of IGMP/MLD message transmission\n   through a tunnel link ought to be considered\
    \ when parameters are set.\n   For example, the [Query Interval] and [Query Response\
    \ Interval] could\n   be set shorter to compensate for transmission delay, and\
    \ the\n   [Robustness Variable] could be increased to compensate for possible\n\
    \   packet loss.\n   The third scenario occurs in [9], in which the mobile access\
    \ gateway\n   (i.e., foreign router) acts as the IGMP/MLD Proxy [5] in PMIPv6\
    \ [6].\n   Through the bidirectional tunnel established with the local mobility\n\
    \   anchor (i.e., home router), the mobile access gateway sends summary\n   reports\
    \ of its downstream member hosts to the local mobility anchor.\n   Apart from\
    \ the distance factor, which influences the parameter\n   setting, the [Query\
    \ Response Interval] on the local mobility anchor\n   could be set to a smaller\
    \ value because the number of mobile access\n   gateways is much smaller compared\
    \ to the number of hosts, and the\n   chance of packet burst is low for the same\
    \ reason.  Additionally, the\n   power consumption due to a lower query interval\
    \ is not an issue for\n   the mobile access gateways because the mobile access\
    \ gateways are\n   usually not battery-powered.\n   Ideally, the IGMP/MLD querier\
    \ router adjusts its parameter settings\n   according to the actual mobile IP\
    \ network conditions to benefit\n   service performance and resource utilization.\
    \  It would be desirable\n   for a home router to determine the aforementioned\
    \ timers and values\n   according to the delay between the initiating IGMP/MLD\
    \ Query and the\n   responding IGMP/MLD Report.  However, describing how these\
    \ timers and\n   values can be dynamically adjusted is out of scope for this document.\n"

- title: Appendix A.  Unicasting a General Query
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Unicasting a General Query\n   This appendix describes the possible\
    \ IGMP and MLD protocol extensions\n   for further optimization in mobile and\
    \ wireless environments.  It\n   might be beneficial to include the following\
    \ considerations when a\n   newer version or modification of IGMP and MLD protocols\
    \ is considered\n   in the future.\n   IGMPv3 and MLDv2 specifications [1] [2]\
    \ explain that a host must\n   accept and process any query whose IP Destination\
    \ Address field\n   contains any of the addresses (unicast or multicast) assigned\
    \ to the\n   interface on which the query arrives.  In general, the all-hosts\n\
    \   multicast address (224.0.0.1) or link-scope all-nodes multicast\n   address\
    \ (ff02::1) is used as the IP destination address of an IGMP/\n   MLD General\
    \ Query.  On the other hand, according to [1] and [2], a\n   router may be able\
    \ to unicast a General Query to the tracked member\n   hosts in [Query Interval],\
    \ if the router keeps track of membership\n   information (Section 3).\n   Unicasting\
    \ an IGMP/MLD General Query would reduce the drain on the\n   battery power of\
    \ mobile hosts, as only the active hosts that have\n   been receiving multicast\
    \ contents respond to the unicast IGMP/MLD\n   General Query messages and non-active\
    \ hosts do not need to pay\n   attention to the IGMP/MLD Query messages.  This\
    \ also allows the\n   upstream router to proceed with fast leaves (or shorten\
    \ leave\n   latency) by setting LMQC/LLQC smaller because, ideally, the router\n\
    \   can immediately converge and update the membership information.\n   However,\
    \ there is a concern regarding the unicast General Query: if a\n   multicast router\
    \ sends a General Query \"only\" by unicast, it cannot\n   discover potential\
    \ member hosts whose join requests were lost.  Since\n   the hosts do not retransmit\
    \ the same join requests (i.e., unsolicited\n   Report messages), they lose the\
    \ chance to join the channels unless\n   the upstream router asks for membership\
    \ information by sending a\n   multicast General Query.  This concern will be\
    \ solved by using both\n   unicast and multicast General Queries and configuring\
    \ the [Query\n   Interval] timer value for multicast General Query and the [Unicast\n\
    \   Query Interval] timer value for unicast General Query.  However,\n   using\
    \ two different timers for General Queries would require a\n   protocol extension\
    \ that is beyond the scope of this document.  If a\n   router does not distinguish\
    \ multicast and unicast General Query\n   Intervals, the router should only use\
    \ and enable multicast General\n   Queries.\n   Also, the unicast General Query\
    \ does not remove the need for the\n   multicast General Query.  The multicast\
    \ General Query is necessary\n   for updating membership information if the information\
    \ is not\n   correctly synchronized due to missing reports.  Therefore, the\n\
    \   unicast General Query should not be used for an implementation that\n   does\
    \ not allow the configuration of different query interval timers\n   such as [Query\
    \ Interval] and [Unicast Query Interval].  If a router\n   does not distinguish\
    \ these multicast and unicast General Query\n   Intervals, the router should only\
    \ use and enable multicast General\n   Queries.\n"
