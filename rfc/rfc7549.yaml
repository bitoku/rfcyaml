  - "Abstract\n   In 3GPP networks, the signaling path between a calling user and
    a\n   called user can be partitioned into segments, referred to as traffic\n   legs.
    \ Each traffic leg may span networks belonging to different\n   operators and
    will have its own characteristics that can be different\n   from other traffic
    legs in the same call.  A traffic leg might be\n   associated with multiple SIP
    dialogs, e.g., in case a Back-to-Back\n   User Agent (B2BUA) that modifies the
    SIP dialog identifier is located\n   within the traffic leg.\n   This document
    defines a new SIP URI parameter, 'iotl' (an\n   abbreviation for Inter-Operator
    Traffic Leg).  The parameter can be\n   used in a SIP URI to indicate that the
    entity associated with the\n   address, or an entity responsible for the host
    part of the address,\n   represents the end of a specific traffic leg (or multiple
    traffic\n   legs).\n   The SIP URI 'iotl' parameter defined in this document has
    known uses\n   in 3GPP networks.  Usage in other networks is also possible.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   In a 3GPP network, an end-user device can be attached (e.g.,
    using a\n   radio access network) to its own operator network (home network)\n
    \  [TS.3GPP.24.229] or to another operator's network (visited network)\n   [TS.3GPP.24.229].
    \ In the latter case, the user is referred to as a\n   roaming user.\n   3GPP
    operator networks are often not connected directly to each\n   other.  Instead,
    there might be intermediate networks, referred to as\n   3GPP transit networks,
    between them.  Such transit networks act on\n   the SIP level or the IP level.\n
    \  In 3GPP networks, the signaling path between a calling user and a\n   called
    user can be partitioned into segments, referred to as traffic\n   legs.  Each
    traffic leg may span networks belonging to different\n   operators and will have
    its own characteristics that can be different\n   from other traffic legs in the
    same call.  A traffic leg might be\n   associated with multiple SIP dialogs, e.g.,
    in case a B2BUA [RFC3261]\n   that modifies the SIP dialog identifier is located
    within the traffic\n   leg.\n   The traffic leg information can be used by intermediary
    entities to\n   make policy decisions related to, e.g., media anchoring, signaling\n
    \  policy, insertion of media functions (e.g., transcoder), and\n   charging.\n
    \  The figure below shows two users (Alice and Bob) and the different\n   type
    of networks that the signaling might traverse.  The signaling\n   path can be
    divided into multiple traffic legs, and the type of\n   traffic legs depends on
    how the signaling is routed.\n   Alice -- ORIG HNW +++++ TRANSIT NW +++++ TERM

    \              Figure 1: 3GPP Operator Network Roaming Roles\n   In Figure 1,
    Alice is a user initiating communication with Bob. Also,\n   consider the following
    information:\n   Alice is attached to an originating network, which is either
    the home\n   network of Alice or a visited network (in case Alice is roaming).
    \ In\n   both cases, any originating service is provided by the home network\n
    \  of Alice.\n   Bob is attached to a terminating network, which is either the
    home\n   network of Bob or a visited network (in case Bob is roaming).  In\n   both
    cases, any terminating service is provided by the home network\n   of Bob.\n   A
    transit network providing transit functions (e.g., translation of\n   free phone
    numbers) may be included between the originating and\n   terminating networks
    and between visited and home networks.\n   This document defines a new SIP URI
    parameter [RFC3261], 'iotl' (an\n   abbreviation for Inter-Operator Traffic Leg).
    \ The parameter can be\n   used in a SIP URI to indicate that the entity associated
    with the\n   address, or an entity responsible for the host part of the address,\n
    \  represents the end of a specific traffic leg (or multiple traffic\n   legs).\n
    \  This document defines the following 'iotl' parameter values:\n   o  homea-homeb\n
    \  o  homeb-visitedb\n   o  visiteda-homea\n   o  homea-visiteda\n   o  visiteda-homeb\n
    \  SIP entities that do not support the SIP URI 'iotl' parameter will\n   simply
    ignore it, if received, as defined in [RFC3261].\n"

    '
  - contents:
    - "5.1.  Usage\n   As specified in [RFC3261], when a SIP entity inserts a SIP
      URI in an\n   initial request for a dialog, or in a stand-alone request, the
      SIP\n   URI will be used to route the request to another SIP entity,\n   addressed
      by the SIP URI, or to a SIP entity responsible for the host\n   part of the
      SIP URI (e.g., a SIP registrar).  If such an entity\n   represents the end of
      one or more traffic legs, the SIP entity\n   inserting the SIP URI can add a
      SIP URI 'iotl' parameter to the SIP\n   URI to indicate the type(s) of traffic
      leg.  Each parameter value\n   indicates a type of traffic leg.\n   For routing
      of an initial SIP request for a dialog, or a stand-alone\n   SIP request, a
      SIP entity can add the 'iotl' parameter to (a) the SIP\n   URI of the Request-URI
      [RFC3261] or (b) the SIP URI of a Route header\n   field [RFC3261] of the SIP
      request.  SIP entities can add the 'iotl'\n   parameter to the SIP URI of a
      Path header field [RFC3327] or a\n   Service-Route header field [RFC3608] in
      order for the parameter to\n   later occur in a Route header field.\n   When
      a SIP entity receives an initial request for a dialog or a\n   stand-alone request,
      which contains one or more SIP URI 'iotl'\n   parameters, it identifies the
      type of traffic leg in the following\n   way:\n   o  if the SIP request contains
      a single Route header field containing\n      a SIP URI with an 'iotl' parameter,
      that parameter identifies the\n      type of traffic leg;\n   o  if the SIP
      request contains multiple Route header fields\n      containing a SIP URI with
      an 'iotl' parameter, the 'iotl'\n      parameter associated with the SIP URI
      of the topmost Route header\n      field (or, if the SIP URI of the topmost
      Route header field does\n      not contain an 'iotl' parameter, the SIP URI
      of the Route header\n      field closest to the topmost) identifies the type
      of traffic leg;\n      or\n   o  if a SIP request contains an 'iotl' parameter
      only in the Request-\n      URI SIP URI, the 'iotl' parameter identifies the
      type of traffic\n      leg.\n   During SIP registration [RFC3261], entities
      can add the 'iotl'\n   parameter to the SIP URI of a Path or Service-Route header
      field if\n   the entity is aware that the SIP URI will be used to indicate the
      end\n   of a specific traffic leg for initial requests for dialogs or stand-\n
      \  alone requests sent on the registration path.\n   As defined in [RFC3261],
      a SIP proxy must not modify or remove URI\n   parameters from SIP URIs associated
      with other entities.  This also\n   applies to the 'iotl' parameter.\n"
