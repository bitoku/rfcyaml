  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is an implementation report for the ForCES\
    \ protocol,\n   model, and the SCTP TML documents, and includes an interoperability\n\
    \   report.\n   It follows the outline suggested by [RFC5657].\n   ForCES defines\
    \ an architectural framework and associated protocols to\n   standardize information\
    \ exchange between the control plane and the\n   forwarding plane in a ForCES\
    \ network element (ForCES NE).  [RFC3654]\n   has defined the ForCES requirements,\
    \ and [RFC3746] has defined the\n   ForCES framework.\n"
- title: 1.1.  ForCES Protocol
  contents:
  - "1.1.  ForCES Protocol\n   The ForCES protocol works in a master-slave mode in\
    \ which forwarding\n   elements (FEs) are slaves and control elements (CEs) are\
    \ masters.\n   The protocol includes commands for transport of Logical Functional\n\
    \   Block (LFB) configuration information, association setup, status,\n   event\
    \ notifications, etc.  The reader is encouraged to read the\n   ForCES Protocol\
    \ Specification [RFC5810] for further information.\n"
- title: 1.2.  ForCES Model
  contents:
  - "1.2.  ForCES Model\n   The ForCES Model [RFC5812] presents a formal way to define\
    \ FE Logical\n   Functional Blocks (LFBs) using XML.  LFB configuration components,\n\
    \   capabilities, and associated events are defined when the LFB is\n   formally\
    \ created.  The LFBs within the FE are accordingly controlled\n   in a standardized\
    \ way by the ForCES protocol.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Transport Mapping Layer
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Transport Mapping Layer\n   The TML transports the protocol layer (PL)\
    \ messages [RFC5810].  The\n   TML is where the issues of how to achieve transport-level\n\
    \   reliability, congestion control, multicast, ordering, etc. are\n   handled.\
    \  All ForCES protocol layer implementations MUST be portable\n   across all TMLs.\
    \  Although more than one TML may be standardized for\n   the ForCES protocol,\
    \ all implementations MUST implement SCTP TML\n   [RFC5811].\n"

    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.2.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Definitions\n   This document follows the terminology defined by the ForCES\n\
    \   requirements in [RFC3654] and by the ForCES framework in [RFC3746].\n   The\
    \ definitions are repeated below for clarity.\n      Control Element (CE) - A\
    \ logical entity that implements the ForCES\n      protocol and uses it to instruct\
    \ one or more FEs on how to process\n      packets.  CEs handle functionality\
    \ such as the execution of\n      control and signaling protocols.\n      Forwarding\
    \ Element (FE) - A logical entity that implements the\n      ForCES protocol.\
    \  FEs use the underlying hardware to provide\n      per-packet processing and\
    \ handling as directed/controlled by one\n      or more CEs via the ForCES protocol.\n\
    \      LFB (Logical Functional Block) - The basic building block that is\n   \
    \   operated on by the ForCES protocol.  The LFB is a well defined,\n      logically\
    \ separable functional block that resides in an FE and is\n      controlled by\
    \ the CE via the ForCES protocol.  The LFB may reside\n      at the FE's datapath\
    \ and process packets or may be purely an FE\n      control or configuration entity\
    \ that is operated on by the CE.\n      Note that the LFB is a functionally accurate\
    \ abstraction of the\n      FE's processing capabilities, but not a hardware-accurate\n\
    \      representation of the FE implementation.\n      LFB Class and LFB Instance\
    \ - LFBs are categorized by LFB Classes.\n      An LFB Instance represents an\
    \ LFB Class (or Type) existence.\n      There may be multiple instances of the\
    \ same LFB Class (or Type) in\n      an FE.  An LFB Class is represented by an\
    \ LFB Class ID, and an LFB\n      Instance is represented by an LFB Instance ID.\
    \  As a result, an\n      LFB Class ID associated with an LFB Instance ID uniquely\
    \ specifies\n      an LFB existence.\n      LFB Metadata - Metadata is used to\
    \ communicate per-packet state\n      from one LFB to another, but is not sent\
    \ across the network.  The\n      FE model defines how such metadata is identified,\
    \ produced, and\n      consumed by the LFBs.  It defines the functionality but\
    \ not how\n      metadata is encoded within an implementation.\n      LFB Components\
    \ - Operational parameters of the LFBs that must be\n      visible to the CEs\
    \ are conceptualized in the FE model as the LFB\n      components.  The LFB components\
    \ include, for example, flags,\n      single-parameter arguments, complex arguments,\
    \ and tables that the\n      CE can read and/or write via the ForCES protocol\
    \ (see below).\n      ForCES Protocol - While there may be multiple protocols\
    \ used\n      within the overall ForCES architecture, the term \"ForCES protocol\"\
    \n      and \"protocol\" refer to the \"Fp\" reference points in the ForCES\n\
    \      framework in [RFC3746].  This protocol does not apply to CE-to-CE\n   \
    \   communication, FE-to-FE communication, or to communication between\n     \
    \ FE and CE managers.  Basically, the ForCES protocol works in a\n      master-slave\
    \ mode in which FEs are slaves and CEs are masters.\n      ForCES Protocol Transport\
    \ Mapping Layer (ForCES TML) - A layer in\n      ForCES protocol architecture\
    \ that uses the capabilities of\n      existing transport protocols to specifically\
    \ address protocol\n      message transportation issues, such as how the protocol\
    \ messages\n      are mapped to different transport media (like TCP, IP, ATM,\n\
    \      Ethernet, etc.), and how to achieve and implement reliability,\n      multicast,\
    \ ordering, etc.  The ForCES TML specifications are\n      detailed in separate\
    \ ForCES documents, one for each TML.\n"
- title: 3.  Summary
  contents:
  - "3.  Summary\n   Three independent implementations, NTT Japan, the University\
    \ of\n   Patras, and Zhejiang Gongshang University, were surveyed and found to\n\
    \   already implement all the major features.  All implementors mentioned\n  \
    \ they will be implementing all missing features in the future.\n   An interop\
    \ test was conducted in July 2009 for all three\n   implementations.  Two other\
    \ organizations, Mojatatu Networks and\n   Hangzhou Baud Information and Networks\
    \ Technology Corporation, which\n   independently extended two different well\
    \ known public domain\n   protocol analyzers, Ethereal/Wireshark and tcpdump,\
    \ also participated\n   in the interop for a total of five independent organizations\n\
    \   implementing.  The two protocol analyzers were used to verify the\n   validity\
    \ of ForCES protocol messages (and in some cases semantics).\n   There were no\
    \ notable difficulties in the interoperability test, and\n   almost all issues\
    \ were code bugs that were dealt with mostly on site;\n   tests repeated successfully,\
    \ as stated in Section 6.2.3.\n"
- title: 4.  Methodology
  contents:
  - "4.  Methodology\n   This report describes an implementation experience survey\
    \ as well as\n   the results of the interoperability test.\n   The survey information\
    \ was gathered after implementors answered a\n   brief questionnaire regarding\
    \ all ForCES Protocol, Model, and SCTP\n   TML features.  The results can be seen\
    \ in Section 6.1.\n   The interoperability results were part of the interoperability\
    \ test.\n   Extended Ethereal and extended tcpdump were used to verify the\n \
    \  results.  The results can be seen in Section 6.2.\n"
- title: 5.  Exceptions
  contents:
  - "5.  Exceptions\n   The core features of the ForCES Protocol, Model, and SCTP\
    \ TML were\n   implemented and assessed in an interop test in July 2009.  The\n\
    \   intention of the interop testing was to validate that all the main\n   features\
    \ of the three core documents were interoperable amongst\n   different implementations.\
    \  The tested features can be seen in\n   Section 6.2.2.\n   Different organizations\
    \ surveyed have implemented certain features\n   but not others.  This approach\
    \ is driven by the presence of different\n   LFBs that the different organizations\
    \ currently implement.  All\n   organizations surveyed have indicated their intention\
    \ to implement\n   all outstanding features in due time.  The implemented features\
    \ can\n   be seen in Section 6.1.\n   The mandated TML security requirement, IP\
    \ security (IPsec), was not\n   validated during the interop and is not discussed\
    \ in this document.\n   Since IPsec is well known and widely deployed, not testing\
    \ in the\n   presence of IPsec does not invalidate the tests done.  Note that\n\
    \   Section 6.1.3.3 indicates that none of the implementations reporting\n   included\
    \ support for IPsec, but all indicated their intention to\n   implement it.\n\
    \   Although the SCTP priority ports have changed since the\n   interoperability\
    \ test with the version of the SCTP TML draft\n   available prior to the publication\
    \ of RFC 5811, the change has no\n   impact on the validity of the interoperability\
    \ test.\n"

    \ University of Patras, in\n   the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.\n\
    \   There were two options for participation in the interoperability\n   test.\n\
    \   1.  Locally, on the University of Patras premises.\n   2.  Remotely, via Internet.\n\
    \   Implementations from NTT and the University of Patras were present\n   locally\
    \ on the University of Patras premises in Greece, while the\n   implementation\
    \ from Zhejiang Gongshang University, which was behind a\n   NAT, connected remotely\
    \ from China.\n   The interoperability test validated the basic functionality\
    \ of the\n   ForCES protocol, mainly message exchanging and handling.\n   The\
    \ following scenarios were tested.\n"
- title: 6.2.1.  Scenarios
  contents:
  - "6.2.1.  Scenarios\n   The main goal of the interoperability test was to validate\
    \ the basic\n   protocol functionality; the test parameters were limited.\n  \
    \ 1.  In the Association Setup message, all report messages were\n       ignored.\n\
    \   2.  In the Association Setup stage, the FEO OperEnable Event (FE to\n    \
    \   CE), Config FEO Adminup (CE to FE), and FEO Config-Resp (FE to\n       CE)\
    \ messages were ignored.  The CEs assumed that the FEs were\n       enabled once\
    \ the LFB selectors had been queried.\n   3.  Only FULLDATA-TLVs were used and\
    \ not SPARSEDATA-TLVs.\n   4.  There were no transaction operations.\n   5.  Each\
    \ message had only one LFBSelect-TLV, one OPER-TLV, and one\n       PATH-DATA-TLV\
    \ per message when these were used.\n"

    \ FEs communicate.  As the first\n   part in a successful CE-FE connection, the\
    \ participating CEs and FEs\n   had to be configurable.\n   In the pre-association\
    \ phase, the following configuration items were\n   set up regarding the CEs:\n\
    \   o  The CE ID.\n   o  The FE IDs that were connected to this CE.\n   o  The\
    \ IP addresses of the FEs that connected to the CE.\n   o  The TML priority ports.\n\

  - "6.2.1.2.  Scenario 2 - TML Priority Channels Connection\n   For the interoperability\

    \ defines three priority channels, with specific\n   ports:\n   o  High priority\
    \ - Port number: 6704\n   o  Medium priority - Port number: 6705\n   o  Lower\
    \ priority - Port number: 6706\n   However, at the time of the interoperability\
    \ test, the SCTP ports of\n   the three priority channels were the following:\n\
    \   o  High priority - Port number: 6700\n   o  Medium priority - Port number:\
    \ 6701\n   o  Lower priority - Port number: 6702\n   As specified in Section 5,\

- title: 6.2.3.  Interoperability Results
  contents:
  - "6.2.3.  Interoperability Results\n   All implementations were found to be interoperable\
    \ with each other.\n   All scenarios were tested successfully.\n   The following\
    \ issues were found and dealt with.\n   1.   Some messages were sent on the wrong\
    \ priority channels.  There\n        were some ambiguities in the SCTP TML document\
    \ regarding how to\n        deal with such a situation.  The possibilities were\
    \ an FE\n        response on the same (wrong) channel as a CE query; an FE\n \
    \       response on the correctly documented channel for the message; or\n   \
    \     simply dropping the packet.  This has been corrected by\n        mandating\
    \ the message-to-channel mapping to be a MUST in the\n        SCTP TML document\
    \ [RFC5811] before it was published as an RFC.\n   2.   At some point, a CE sent\
    \ a Teardown message to the FE.  The CE\n        expected the FE to shut down\
    \ the connection, and the FE waited\n        for the CE to shut down the connection;\
    \ both were then caught in\n        a deadlock.  This was a code bug and was fixed.\n\
    \   3.   Sometimes, only when the CE and FE were remote to each other\n      \
    \  (one being in China and another in Greece), the Association\n        Setup\
    \ message was not received by the CE side, and therefore an\n        association\
    \ never completed.  This was not an implementation\n        issue but rather a\
    \ network issue.  This issue was solved with\n        the retransmission of the\
    \ non-delivered messages.\n   4.   An implementation did not take into account\
    \ that the padding in\n        TLVs MUST NOT be included in the length of the\
    \ TLV.  This was a\n        code bug and was fixed.\n   5.   The Execution Mode\
    \ flag was set to Reserved by a CE and was not\n        ignored by the FE.  This\
    \ was a code bug and was fixed.\n   6.   After the FEHBPolicy was set to 1, the\
    \ FE didn't send any\n        heartbeats.  This was a code bug and was fixed.\n\
    \   7.   Some FEs sent heartbeats with the ACK flag set to a value other\n   \
    \     than NoACK.  The CE responded.  This was a code bug and was\n        fixed.\n\
    \   8.   When a cable was disconnected, none of the TML implementations\n    \
    \    detected it.  The association was eventually dropped due to\n        heartbeat\
    \ detection; this test was a success, but this is an\n        implementation issue\
    \ that implementors should keep in mind.\n        This is an SCTP options issue.\
    \  Nothing needed to be done.\n   9.   A CE crashed due to unknown LFB selector\
    \ values.  This was a\n        code bug and was fixed.\n   10.  With the remote\
    \ connection from China (which was behind a NAT)\n        to Greece, there were\
    \ a lot of ForCES packet retransmissions.\n        The problem was that packets\
    \ like heartbeats were retransmitted.\n        This was an implementation issue\
    \ regarding SCTP usage that\n        implementors should keep in mind.  The SCTP-PR\
    \ option needed to\n        be used.  Nothing needed to be done.\n   The interoperability\
    \ test went so well that an additional extended\n   test was added to check for\
    \ batching messages.  This test was also\n   done successfully.\n"
