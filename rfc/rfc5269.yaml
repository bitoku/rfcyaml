  - "1.  Introduction\n   In Fast Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) [FMIP], a Fast Binding Update\
    \ (FBU) is\n   sent from a Mobile Node (MN), undergoing IP handover, to the previous\n\
    \   Access Router (AR).  The FBU causes a routing change so traffic sent\n   to\
    \ the MN's previous Care-of Address on the previous AR's link is\n   tunneled\
    \ to the new Care-of Address on the new AR's link.  Only an MN\n   authorized\
    \ to claim the address should be able to change the routing\n   for the previous\
    \ Care-of Address.  If such authorization is not\n   established, an attacker\
    \ can redirect a victim MN's traffic at will.\n   In this document, a lightweight\
    \ mechanism is defined by which a\n   shared handover key for securing FMIP can\
    \ be provisioned on the MN by\n   the AR.  The mechanism utilizes SEND [SEND]\
    \ and an additional\n   public/private key pair, generated on the MN using the\
    \ same public\n   key algorithm as SEND, to encrypt/decrypt a shared handover\
    \ key sent\n   from the AR to the MN.  The key provisioning occurs at some arbitrary\n\
    \   time prior to handover, thereby relieving any performance overhead on\n  \
    \ the handover process.  The message exchange between the MN and AR to\n   provision\
    \ the handover key is required to be protected by SEND; that\n   is, the source\
    \ address for the key provisioning messages must be a\n   CGA and the messages\
    \ must be signed with the CGA private key.  This\n   allows the AR to establish\
    \ the MN's authorization to operate on the\n   CGA.  The AR uses the CGA to name\
    \ the handover key.  The SEND key\n   pair is, however, independent from the handover\
    \ encryption/decryption\n   key pair and from the actual handover key.  Once the\
    \ shared handover\n   key has been established, when the MN undergoes IP handover,\
    \ the MN\n   generates an authorization Message Authentication Code (MAC) on the\n\
    \   FBU.  The previous care-of CGA included in the FBU is used by the AR\n   to\
    \ find the right handover key for checking the authorization.\n   Handover keys\
    \ are an instantiation of the purpose built key\n   architectural principle [PBK].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Brief Review of SEND\n   SEND protects against a variety of threats to\
    \ local link address\n   resolution (also known as Neighbor Discovery) and last\
    \ hop router\n   (AR) discovery in IPv6 [RFC3756].  These threats are not exclusive\
    \ to\n   wireless networks, but they generally are easier to mount on certain\n\
    \   wireless networks because the link between the access point and MN\n   can't\
    \ be physically secured.\n   SEND utilizes CGAs in order to secure Neighbor Discovery\
    \ signaling\n   [CGA].  Briefly, a CGA is formed by hashing together the IPv6\
    \ subnet\n   prefix for a node's subnet, a random nonce, and an RSA public key,\n\
    \   called the CGA public key.  The CGA private key is used to sign a\n   Neighbor\
    \ Advertisement (NA) message sent to resolve the link-layer\n   address to the\
    \ IPv6 address.  The combination of the CGA and the\n   signature on the NA proves\
    \ to a receiving node the sender's\n   authorization to claim the address.  The\
    \ node may opportunistically\n   generate one or several keys specifically for\
    \ SEND, or it may use a\n   certified key that it distributes more widely.\n"

  - "2.2.  Protocol Overview\n   The protocol utilizes the SEND secured Router Solicitation\
    \ for Proxy\n   Advertisement (RtSolPr)/Proxy Router Advertisement (PrRtAdv) [FMIP]\n\
    \   exchange between the MN and the AR to transport an encrypted, shared\n   handover\
    \ key from the AR to the MN.  First, the MN generates the\n   necessary key pair\
    \ and associated CGA addresses so that the MN can\n   employ SEND.  Then, the\
    \ MN generates a public/private key pair for\n   encrypting/decrypting the shared\
    \ handover key, using the same public\n   key algorithm as was used for SEND.\
    \  The MN then sends an RtSolPr\n   message with a Handover Key Request Option\
    \ containing the handover\n   key encryption public key.  The source address of\
    \ the RtSolPr message\n   is the MN's care-of CGA on the AR's link, the RtSolPr\
    \ message is\n   signed with the MN's CGA key, and contains the CGA Parameters\
    \ option,\n   in accordance with RFC 3971 [SEND].  The AR verifies the message\n\
    \   using SEND, then utilizes the handover key encryption public key to\n   encrypt\
    \ a shared handover key, which is included with the PrRtAdv in\n   the Handover\
    \ Key Reply Option.  The MN decrypts the shared handover\n   key and uses it to\
    \ establish an authorization MAC when it sends an\n   FBU to the previous AR.\n"

    \ first validate the PrRtAdvs as\n   described in RFC 3971.  Normally, the MN\
    \ will have obtained the\n   router's certification path to validate an RA prior\
    \ to sending the\n   PrRtSol and the MN MUST check to ensure that the key used\
    \ to sign the\n   PrRtAdv is the router's certified public key.  If the MN does\
    \ not\n   have the router's certification path cached, it MUST use the SEND\n\
    \   CPS/CPA messages to obtain the certification path to validate the\n   key.\
    \  If a certified key from the router was not used to sign the\n   message, the\
    \ message MUST be dropped.\n   From the messages that validate, the MN SHOULD\
    \ choose one with an AT\n   flag in the Handover Key Reply Option indicating an\
    \ authentication\n   algorithm that the MN supports.  From that message, the MN\
    \ MUST\n   determine which handover key encryption public key to use in the\n\
    \   event the MN has more than one.  The MN finds the right public key to\n  \
    \ use by matching the SEND nonce from the RtSolPr.  If no such match\n   occurs,\
    \ the MN MUST drop the PrRtAdv.  The MN MUST use the matching\n   private key\

    \ and store the handover key for later use,\n   named with the AR's CGA, along\
    \ with the algorithm type and\n   HK-LIFETIME.  The MN MUST use the returned algorithm\
    \ type indicated\n   in the PrRtAdv.  The MN MUST index the handover keys with\
    \ the AR's\n   IPv6 address, to which the MN later sends the FBU, and the MN's\
    \ CGA\n   to which the handover key applies.  This allows the MN to select the\n\
    \   proper key when communicating with a previous AR.  Prior to\n   HK-LIFETIME\
    \ expiring, the MN MUST request a new key from the AR if\n   FMIPv6 service is\
    \ still required from the router.\n   If more than one router responds to the\
    \ RtSolPr, the MN MAY keep\n   track of all such keys.  If none of the PrRtAdvs\
    \ contains an\n   algorithm type indicator corresponding to an algorithm the MN\n\
    \   supports, the MN MAY re-send the RtSolPr requesting a different\n   algorithm,\
    \ but to prevent bidding down attacks from compromised\n   routers, the MN SHOULD\
    \ NOT request an algorithm that is weaker than\n   its original request.\n"

- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document describes a shared key provisioning\
    \ protocol for the\n   FMIPv6 handover optimization protocol.  The key provisioning\
    \ protocol\n   utilizes a public key generated with the same public key algorithm\
    \ as\n   SEND to bootstrap a shared key for authorizing changes due to\n   handover\
    \ associated with the MN's former address on the PAR.  General\n   security considerations\
    \ involving CGAs apply to the protocol\n   described in this document, see [CGA]\
    \ for a discussion of security\n   considerations around CGAs.  This protocol\
    \ is subject to the same\n   risks from replay attacks and denial-of-service (DoS)\
    \ attacks using\n   the RtSolPr as the SEND protocol [SEND] for RS.  The measures\n\
    \   recommended in RFC 3971 for mitigating replay attacks and DoS attacks\n  \
    \ apply here as well.  An additional consideration involves when to\n   generate\
    \ the handover key on the AR.  To avoid state depletion\n   attacks, the handover\
    \ key SHOULD NOT be generated prior to SEND\n   processing that verifies the originator\
    \ of RtSolPr.  State depletion\n   attacks can be addressed by techniques, such\
    \ as rate limiting\n   RtSolPr, restricting the amount of state reserved for unresolved\n\
    \   solicitations, and clever cache management.  These techniques are the\n  \
    \ same as used in implementing Neighbor Discovery.\n   For other FMIPv6 security\
    \ considerations, please see the FMIPv6\n   document [FMIP].\n"
