  - "1.  Introduction\n   The base DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE)\n\
    \   specification [RFC6698] describes how to use TLSA resource records\n   secured\
    \ by DNSSEC [RFC4033] to associate a target server's connection\n   endpoint with\
    \ its Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate (thus\n   enabling administrators\
    \ of domain names to specify the keys used in\n   that domain's TLS servers).\
    \  Some application protocols locate\n   connection endpoints indirectly via SRV\
    \ records [RFC2782].  As a\n   result of this indirection, the rules specified\
    \ in [RFC6698] cannot\n   be directly applied to such application protocols. \
    \ (Rules for SMTP\n   [RFC5321], which uses MX resource records instead of SRV\
    \ records, are\n   described in [RFC7672].)\n   This document describes how to\
    \ use DANE TLSA records with SRV\n   records.  To summarize:\n   o  We rely on\
    \ DNSSEC to secure SRV records that map the desired\n      service, transport\
    \ protocol, and service domain name to the\n      corresponding target server\
    \ connection endpoints (i.e., the target\n      server hostnames and port numbers\
    \ returned in the SRV records for\n      that service type).\n   o  Although in\
    \ accordance with [RFC2782] a service domain name can\n      advertise a number\
    \ of SRV records (some of which might map to\n      connection endpoints that\
    \ do not support TLS), the intent of this\n      specification is for a client\
    \ to securely discover connection\n      endpoints that support TLS.\n   o  The\
    \ TLSA records for each connection endpoint are located using\n      the transport\
    \ protocol, port number, and hostname for the target\n      server (not the service\
    \ domain name).\n   o  When DNSSEC-validated TLSA records are published for a\
    \ given\n      connection endpoint, clients always use TLS when connecting (even\n\
    \      if the connection endpoint supports cleartext communication).\n   o  If\
    \ there is at least one usable TLSA record for a given connection\n      endpoint,\
    \ the connection endpoint's TLS certificate or public key\n      needs to match\
    \ at least one of those usable TLSA records.\n   o  If there are no usable TLSA\
    \ records for a given connection\n      endpoint, the target server hostname is\
    \ used as one of the\n      acceptable reference identifiers, as described in\
    \ [RFC6125].\n      Other reference identifiers might arise through CNAME expansion\
    \ of\n      either the service domain name or target server hostname, as\n   \
    \   detailed in [RFC7671].\n   o  If there are no usable TLSA records for any\
    \ connection endpoint\n      (and thus the client cannot securely discover a connection\n\
    \      endpoint that supports TLS), the client's behavior is a matter for\n  \
    \    the application protocol or client implementation; this might\n      involve\
    \ a fallback to non-DANE behavior using the public key\n      infrastructure [RFC5280].\n"

- title: 3.1.  SRV Query
  contents:
  - "3.1.  SRV Query\n   When the client makes an SRV query, a successful result will\n\
    \   typically be a list of one or more SRV records (or possibly a chain\n   of\
    \ CNAME/DNAME aliases leading to such a list).\n      NOTE: Implementers need\
    \ to be aware that unsuccessful results can\n      occur because of various DNS-related\
    \ errors; guidance on avoiding\n      downgrade attacks can be found in Section\
    \ 2.1 of [RFC7672].\n   For this specification to apply, the entire chain of DNS\
    \ RRset(s)\n   returned MUST be \"secure\" according to DNSSEC validation (Section\
    \ 5\n   of [RFC4035]).  In the case where the answer is obtained via a chain\n\
    \   of CNAME and/or DNAME aliases, the whole chain of CNAME and DNAME\n   RRsets\
    \ MUST also be secure.\n   If the SRV lookup fails because the RRset is \"bogus\"\
    \ (or the lookup\n   fails for reasons other than no records), the client MUST\
    \ abort its\n   attempt to connect to the desired service.  If the lookup result\
    \ is\n   \"insecure\" (or no SRV records exist), this protocol does not apply\n\
    \   and the client SHOULD fall back to its non-DNSSEC, non-DANE (and\n   possibly\
    \ non-SRV) behavior.\n   When the lookup returns a \"secure\" RRset (possibly\
    \ via a chain of\n   \"secure\" CNAME/DNAME records), the client now has an authentic\
    \ list\n   of target server connection endpoints with weight and priority\n  \
    \ values.  It performs server ordering and selection using the weight\n   and\
    \ priority values without regard to the presence or absence of\n   DNSSEC or TLSA\
    \ records.  It also takes note of the DNSSEC validation\n   status of the SRV\
    \ response for use when checking certificate names\n   (see Section 4).  The client\
    \ can then proceed to making address\n   queries on the target server hostnames\
    \ as described in the following\n   section.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Address Queries
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Address Queries\n   For each SRV target server connection endpoint, the\
    \ client makes\n   A and/or AAAA queries, performs DNSSEC validation on the address\n\
    \   (A or AAAA) response, and continues as follows, based on the results:\n  \
    \ o  If a returned RRSet is \"secure\", the client MUST perform a TLSA\n     \
    \ query for that target server connection endpoint, as described in\n      the\
    \ next section.\n   o  If no returned RRsets are \"secure\", the client MUST NOT\
    \ perform a\n      TLSA query for that target server connection endpoint; the\
    \ TLSA\n      query will most likely fail or produce spurious results.\n   o \
    \ If the address record lookup fails (a validation status of either\n      \"\
    bogus\" or \"indeterminate\"), the client MUST NOT connect to this\n      connection\
    \ endpoint; instead, it uses the next most appropriate\n      SRV target.  This\
    \ helps prevent downgrade attacks.\n"
- title: 3.3.  TLSA Queries
  contents:
  - "3.3.  TLSA Queries\n   The client SHALL construct the TLSA query name as described\
    \ in\n   Section 3 of [RFC6698], based on the fields from the SRV record: the\n\
    \   port number from the SRV RDATA, the transport protocol from the SRV\n   query\
    \ name, and the TLSA base domain from the SRV target server\n   hostname.\n  \
    \ For example, the following SRV record for IMAP (see [RFC6186])\n       _imap._tcp.example.com.\
    \ 86400 IN SRV 10 0 9143 imap.example.net.\n   leads to the TLSA query shown below:\n\

  contents:
  - "3.4.  Impact on TLS Usage\n   The client SHALL determine if the TLSA records\
    \ returned in the\n   previous step are usable according to Section 4.1 of [RFC6698].\
    \  This\n   affects the use of TLS as follows:\n   o  If the TLSA response is\
    \ \"secure\" and usable, then the client MUST\n      use TLS when connecting to\
    \ the target server.  The TLSA records\n      are used when validating the server's\
    \ certificate as described in\n      Section 4.\n   o  If the TLSA response is\
    \ \"bogus\" or \"indeterminate\" (or the lookup\n      fails for reasons other\
    \ than no records), then the client MUST NOT\n      connect to the target server\
    \ (the client can still use other SRV\n      targets).\n   o  If the TLSA response\
    \ is \"insecure\" (or no TLSA records exist),\n      then the client SHALL proceed\
    \ as if the target server had no TLSA\n      records.  It MAY connect to the target\
    \ server with or without TLS,\n      subject to the policies of the application\
    \ protocol or client\n      implementation.\n"

    \  The\n   rules described in the next two sections -- Section 4.2 for cases\n\
    \   where there is at least one usable TLSA record, and Section 4.1\n   otherwise\
    \ -- apply to such secure responses.\n"
- title: 4.1.  SRV Records Only
  contents:
  - "4.1.  SRV Records Only\n   If the client received zero usable TLSA certificate\
    \ associations, it\n   SHALL validate the server's TLS certificate using the normal\
    \ PKIX\n   rules [RFC5280] or protocol-specific rules (e.g., following\n   [RFC6125])\
    \ without further input from the TLSA records.  In this\n   case, the client uses\
    \ the information in the server certificate and\n   the DNSSEC validation status\
    \ of the SRV query in its authentication\n   checks.  It SHOULD use the Server\
    \ Name Indication extension (TLS SNI)\n   [RFC6066] or its functional equivalent\
    \ in the relevant application\n   protocol (e.g., in the Extensible Messaging\
    \ and Presence Protocol\n   (XMPP) [RFC6120], this is the 'to' address of the\
    \ initial stream\n   header).  The preferred name SHALL be chosen as follows,\
    \ and the\n   client SHALL verify the identity asserted by the server's certificate\n\
    \   according to Section 6 of [RFC6125], using a list of reference\n   identifiers\
    \ constructed as follows (note again that in RFC 6125 the\n   terms \"source domain\"\
    \ and \"derived domain\" refer to the same things\n   as \"service domain name\"\
    \ and \"target server hostname\" in this\n   document).  The examples below assume\
    \ a service domain name of\n   \"im.example.com\" and a target server hostname\
    \ of\n   \"xmpp23.hosting.example.net\".\n   SRV is insecure:  The reference identifiers\
    \ SHALL include the service\n      domain name and MUST NOT include the SRV target\
    \ server hostname\n      (e.g., include \"im.example.com\" but not\n      \"xmpp23.hosting.example.net\"\
    ).  The service domain name is the\n      preferred name for TLS SNI or its equivalent.\n\
    \   SRV is secure:  The reference identifiers SHALL include both the\n      service\
    \ domain name and the SRV target server hostname (e.g.,\n      include both \"\
    im.example.com\" and \"xmpp23.hosting.example.net\").\n      The service domain\
    \ name is still the preferred name for TLS SNI or\n      its equivalent (this\
    \ reduces code complexity and the possibility\n      of interoperability problems).\n\
    \   In the latter case, the client will accept either identity to ensure\n   compatibility\
    \ with servers that support this specification as well as\n   servers that do\
    \ not support this specification.\n"

    \   If the TLS server's certificate -- or the public key of the server's\n   certificate\
    \ -- matches a usable TLSA record with certificate usage\n   DANE-EE, the client\
    \ MUST ignore validation checks from [RFC5280] and\n   reference identifier checks\

- title: 6.  Guidance for Server Operators
  contents:
  - "6.  Guidance for Server Operators\n   To conform to this specification, the published\
    \ SRV records and\n   subsequent address (A and AAAA) records MUST be secured\
    \ with DNSSEC.\n   There SHOULD also be at least one TLSA record published that\n\
    \   authenticates the server's certificate.\n   When using TLSA records with certificate\
    \ usage DANE-EE, it is not\n   necessary for the deployed certificate to contain\
    \ an identifier for\n   either the source domain or target server hostname.  However,\n\
    \   operators need to be aware that servers relying solely on validation\n   using\
    \ certificate usage DANE-EE TLSA records might prevent clients\n   that do not\
    \ support this specification from successfully connecting\n   with TLS.\n   For\
    \ TLSA records with certificate usage types other than DANE-EE, the\n   certificate(s)\
    \ MUST contain an identifier that matches:\n   o  the service domain name (the\
    \ \"source domain\" in [RFC6125] terms,\n      which is the SRV query domain),\
    \ and/or\n   o  the target server hostname (the \"derived domain\" in [RFC6125]\n\
    \      terms, which is the SRV target hostname).\n   Servers that support multiple\
    \ service domain names (i.e., so-called\n   \"multi-tenanted environments\") can\
    \ implement TLS SNI [RFC6066] or its\n   functional equivalent to determine which\
    \ certificate to offer.\n   Clients that do not support this specification will\
    \ indicate a\n   preference for the service domain name, while clients that support\n\
    \   this specification will indicate the target server hostname.\n   However,\
    \ the server determines what certificate to present in the TLS\n   handshake;\
    \ e.g., the presented certificate might only authenticate\n   the target server\
    \ hostname.\n"

    \ time for end users.  To make\n   this optimization possible, a DNS library might\
    \ perform the address\n   queries and TLSA queries in parallel.  (Because a TLSA\
    \ record can be\n   ignored if it turns out that the address record on which it\

    \ whether they have\n   or do not have TLSA records.  This is so that partial\
    \ or incremental\n   deployment does not break the service.  Different levels\
    \ of\n   deployment are likely if a service domain name has a third-party\n  \
    \ fallback server, for example.\n   The SRV sorting rules are unchanged; in particular,\
    \ they have not\n   been altered in order to prioritize secure connection endpoints\
    \ over\n   insecure connection endpoints.  If a site wants to be secure, it\n\
    \   needs to deploy this protocol completely; a partial deployment is not\n  \

  contents:
  - "9.2.  Certificate Subject Name Matching\n   Section 4 of the TLSA specification\
    \ [RFC6698] leaves the details of\n   checking names in certificates to higher-level\
    \ application protocols,\n   though it suggests the use of [RFC6125].\n   Name\
    \ checks are not necessary if the matching TLSA record is of\n   certificate usage\
    \ DANE-EE.  Because such a record identifies the\n   specific certificate (or\
    \ public key of the certificate), additional\n   checks are superfluous and potentially\
    \ conflicting.\n   Otherwise, while DNSSEC provides a secure binding between the\
    \ server\n   name and the TLSA record, and the TLSA record provides a binding\
    \ to a\n   certificate, this latter step can be indirect via a chain of\n   certificates.\
    \  For example, a certificate usage PKIX-TA TLSA record\n   only authenticates\
    \ the Certification Authority (CA) that issued the\n   certificate, and third\
    \ parties can obtain certificates from the same\n   CA.  Therefore, clients need\
    \ to check to see whether or not the\n   server's certificate matches one of the\

- title: Appendix B.  Rationale
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.  Rationale\n   The long-term goal of this specification is to settle\
    \ on TLS\n   certificates that verify the target server hostname rather than the\n\
    \   service domain name, since this is more convenient for servers\n   hosting\
    \ multiple domains (so-called \"multi-tenanted environments\")\n   and scales\
    \ up more easily to larger numbers of service domain names.\n   There are a number\
    \ of other reasons for doing it this way:\n   o  The certificate is part of the\
    \ server configuration, so it makes\n      sense to associate it with the target\
    \ server hostname rather than\n      the service domain name.\n   o  In the absence\
    \ of TLS SNI, if the certificate identifies the\n      target server hostname,\
    \ then it does not need to list all the\n      possible service domain names.\n\
    \   o  When the server certificate is replaced, it is much easier if\n      there\
    \ is one part of the DNS that needs updating to match, instead\n      of an unbounded\
    \ number of hosted service domain names.\n   o  The same TLSA records work with\
    \ this specification, and with\n      direct connections to the connection endpoint\
    \ in the style of\n      [RFC6698].\n   o  Some application protocols, such as\
    \ SMTP, allow a client to\n      perform transactions with multiple service domain\
    \ names in the\n      same connection.  It is not, in general, feasible for the\
    \ client\n      to specify the service domain name using TLS SNI when the\n  \
    \    connection is established, and the server might not be able to\n      present\
    \ a certificate that authenticates all possible service\n      domain names. \
    \ See [RFC7672] for details.\n   o  It is common for SMTP servers to act in multiple\
    \ roles -- for\n      example, as outgoing relays or as incoming MX servers, depending\n\
    \      on the client identity.  It is simpler if the server can present\n    \
    \  the same certificate regardless of the role in which it is to act.\n      Sometimes\
    \ the server does not know its role until the client has\n      authenticated,\
    \ which usually occurs after TLS has been\n      established.  See [RFC7672] for\
    \ details.\n   This specification does not provide an option to put TLSA records\n\
    \   under the service domain name, because that would add complexity\n   without\
    \ providing any benefit; security protocols are best kept\n   simple.  As described\
    \ above, there are real-world cases where\n   authenticating the service domain\
    \ name cannot be made to work, so\n   there would be complicated criteria regarding\
    \ when service domain\n   name TLSA records might be used and when they cannot.\
    \  This is all\n   avoided by putting the TLSA records under the target server\
    \ hostname.\n   The disadvantage is that clients that do not complete DNSSEC\n\
    \   validation must, according to [RFC6125] rules, check the server\n   certificate\
    \ against the service domain name, since they have no other\n   way to authenticate\
    \ the server.  This means that SNI support or its\n   functional equivalent is\
    \ necessary for backward compatibility.\n"
