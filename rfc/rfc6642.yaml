  - "Abstract\n   In a large RTP session using the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) feedback\n\
    \   mechanism defined in RFC 4585, a feedback target may experience\n   transient\
    \ overload if some event causes a large number of receivers\n   to send feedback\
    \ at once.  This overload is usually avoided by\n   ensuring that feedback reports\
    \ are forwarded to all receivers,\n   allowing them to avoid sending duplicate\
    \ feedback reports.  However,\n   there are cases where it is not recommended\
    \ to forward feedback\n   reports, and this may allow feedback implosion.  This\
    \ memo discusses\n   these cases and defines a new RTCP Third-Party Loss Report\
    \ that can\n   be used to inform receivers that the feedback target is aware of\
    \ some\n   loss event, allowing them to suppress feedback.  Associated Session\n\
    \   Description Protocol (SDP) signaling is also defined.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) feedback messages [RFC4585]\
    \ allow the\n   receivers in an RTP session to report events and ask for action\
    \ from\n   the media source (or a delegated feedback target when using unicast\n\
    \   RTCP feedback with Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) [RFC5760]).  There\n  \
    \ are cases where multiple receivers may initiate the same, or an\n   equivalent,\
    \ message towards the same media source or the same\n   feedback target.  When\
    \ the receiver count is large, this behavior may\n   cause transient overload\
    \ of the media source, the network, or both.\n   This is known as a \"feedback\
    \ storm\" or a \"NACK storm\".\n   One scenario that can cause such feedback storms\
    \ involves video Fast\n   Update requests.  A storm of these feedback messages\
    \ can occur in\n   conversational multimedia scenarios like multipoint video switching\n\
    \   conference [RFC4587], where many receivers may simultaneously lose\n   synchronization\
    \ with the video stream when the speaker is changed in\n   the middle of a session.\
    \  Receivers that issue Fast Update requests\n   (i.e., Full Intra Request (FIR)\
    \ described in RFC 5104 [RFC5104]), can\n   cause an implosion of FIR requests\
    \ from receivers to the same media\n   source since these requests must currently\
    \ be made blind, without\n   knowledge of requests made by other receivers.\n\
    \   RTCP feedback storms may cause short-term overload and, in extreme\n   cases,\
    \ pose a possible risk of increasing network congestion on the\n   control channel\
    \ (e.g., RTCP feedback), the data channel, or both.  It\n   is therefore desirable\
    \ to provide a way of suppressing unneeded\n   feedback.  This document specifies\
    \ a new Third-Party Loss Report for\n   this function.  It supplements the existing\
    \ use of RTCP NACK packets\n   and is also more precise in the uses where the\
    \ network is active to\n   suppress feedback.  It tells receivers explicitly that\
    \ feedback for a\n   particular packet or frame loss is not needed and can provide\
    \ an\n   early indication before the receiver reacts to the loss and invokes\n\
    \   its packet loss repair machinery.  Section 3 provides some example\n   use\
    \ cases of when to send the Third-Party Loss Report message.\n"

  - "3.  Example Use Cases\n   The operation of feedback suppression is similar for\
    \ all types of RTP\n   sessions and topologies [RFC5117]; however, the exact messages\
    \ used\n   and the scenarios in which suppression is employed differ for various\n\
    \   use cases.  The following sections outline some of the intended use\n   cases\
    \ for using the Third-Party Loss Report for feedback suppression\n   and give\
    \ an overview of each.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) Use Case
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) Use Case\n   In SSM RTP sessions as described\
    \ in \"RTP Control Protocol (RTCP)\n   Extensions for Single-Source Multicast\
    \ Sessions with Unicast\n   Feedback\" [RFC5760], one or more media sources send\
    \ RTP packets to a\n   distribution source.  The distribution source relays the\
    \ RTP packets\n   to the receivers using a source-specific multicast group.\n\
    \   As outlined in RFC 5760 [RFC5760], there are two Unicast Feedback\n   models\
    \ that may be used for reporting: the Simple Feedback Model and\n   the Distribution\
    \ Source Feedback Summary Model.  In the Simple\n   Feedback Model, there's no\
    \ need for the distribution source to create\n   the RTCP TPLRs; instead, RTCP\
    \ NACKs are reflected by the distribution\n   source to the other receivers. \
    \ However, in the Distribution Source\n   Feedback Summary Model, the distribution\
    \ source will not redistribute\n   the NACK for some reason (e.g., to prevent\
    \ revealing the identity or\n   existence of a system sending NACK) and may send\
    \ an RTCP TPLR message\n   to the systems that were unable to receive the NACK\
    \ and won't receive\n   the NACK via other means.  The RTCP TPLR can be generated\
    \ at the\n   distribution source when downstream loss is reported (e.g.,\n   downstream\
    \ loss report is received), which indicates to the receivers\n   that they should\
    \ not transmit feedback messages for the same loss\n   event for a certain time.\
    \  Therefore, the distribution source in the\n   Distribution Source Feedback\
    \ Summary Model can be reasonably certain\n   that it will help the situation\
    \ (i.e., the distribution source is\n   unable receive the NACK) by sending this\
    \ RTCP TPLR message to all the\n   relevant receivers impacted by the packet loss.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Unicast-Based Rapid Acquisition of Multicast Stream (RAMS) Use
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Unicast-Based Rapid Acquisition of Multicast Stream (RAMS) Use\n      Case\n\
    \   The typical RAMS architecture [RFC6285] may have several Burst/\n   Retransmission\
    \ Sources (BRSs) behind the multicast source placed at\n   the same level.  These\
    \ BRSs will receive the primary multicast RTP\n   stream from the media source\
    \ and cache the most recent packets after\n   joining the multicast session. \
    \ If packet loss happens at the\n   upstream of all the BRSs or the downstream\
    \ of BRSs, one or all of the\n   BRSs may send an RTCP NACK or RTCP TPLR message\
    \ to the distribution\n   source, where the SSRC in this RTCP NACK or RTCP TPLR\
    \ message is the\n   BRS that is sending the message.  The distribution source\
    \ forwards/\n   reflects this message down on the primary SSM.  The details on\
    \ how\n   the distribution source deals with this message are specified in\n \
    \  [RETRANS-FOR-SSM].\n"
- title: 3.3.  RTP Transport Translator Use Case
  contents:
  - "3.3.  RTP Transport Translator Use Case\n   A Transport Translator (Topo-Trn-Translator),\
    \ as defined in RFC 5117\n   [RFC5117], is typically forwarding the RTP and RTCP\
    \ traffic between\n   RTP clients, for example, converting from multicast to unicast\
    \ for\n   domains that do not support multicast.  The translator may suffer a\n\
    \   loss of important video packets.  In this case, the translator may\n   forward\
    \ an RTCP TPLR message received from upstream in the same way\n   it forwards\
    \ other RTCP traffic.  If the translator acting as the\n   monitor [MONARCH] is\
    \ aware of packet loss, it may use the SSRC of the\n   monitor as the SSRC of\
    \ the packet sender to create a NACK message and\n   send it to the receivers\
    \ that are not aware of packet loss.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) Use Case
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) Use Case\n   When the speaker is changed\
    \ in a voice-activated multipoint video\n   switching conference [RFC4587], an\
    \ RTP mixer can be used to select\n   the available input streams and forward\
    \ them to each participant.  If\n   the MCU is doing a blind switch without waiting\
    \ for a synchronization\n   point on the new stream, it can send a FIR to the\
    \ new video source.\n   In this case, the MCU should send a FIR suppression message\
    \ to the\n   new receivers.  For example, when the RTP mixer starts to receive\
    \ FIR\n   from some participants, it can suppress the remaining session\n   participants\
    \ from sending FIR by sending out an RTCP TPLR message.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Mixer Use Case
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Mixer Use Case\n   A mixer, in accordance with RFC 5117 [RFC5117], aggregates\
    \ multiple\n   RTP streams from other session participants and generates a new\
    \ RTP\n   stream sent to the session participants.  In some cases, the delivery\n\
    \   of video frames delivery may get damaged, for example, due to packet\n   loss\
    \ or delayed delivery, between the media source and the mixer.  In\n   such cases,\
    \ the mixer needs to check if the packet loss will result\n   in PLI or FIR transmissions\
    \ from most of the group by analyzing the\n   received video.  If so, the mixer\
    \ may initiate FIR or PLI towards the\n   media source on behalf of all the session\
    \ participants and send out\n   an RTCP TPLR message to the session participants\
    \ that may or are\n   expected to send a PLI or FIR.  Alternatively, when the\
    \ mixer starts\n   to receive FIR or PLI from some participants and would like\
    \ to\n   suppress the remaining session participants from sending FIR or PLI,\n\
    \   it can just forward the FIR/PLI from one session participant to\n   others.\n"
- title: 4.  Protocol Overview
  contents:
  - "4.  Protocol Overview\n   This document extends the RTCP feedback messages defined\
    \ in the RTP/\n   AVPF [RFC4585] by defining an RTCP Third-Party Loss Report (TPLR)\n\
    \   message.  The RTCP TPLR message can be used by the intermediaries to\n   inform\
    \ the receiver that the sender of the RTCP TPLR has received\n   reports that\
    \ the indicated packets were lost and ask the receiver not\n   to send feedback\
    \ to it regarding these packets.  Intermediaries are\n   variously referred to\
    \ as distribution sources, Burst/Retransmission\n   Sources, MCUs, RTP translators,\
    \ or RTP mixers, depending on the\n   precise use case described Section 3.\n\
    \   RTCP TPLR follows a similar message type format as RTCP NACK or Full\n   Intra\
    \ Request Command.  However, RTCP TPLR is defined as an\n   indication that the\
    \ sender of the feedback has received reports that\n   the indicated packets were\
    \ lost, while NACK [RFC4585] just indicates\n   that the sender of the NACK observed\
    \ that these packets were lost.\n   The RTCP TPLR message is generated by an intermediary\
    \ that may not\n   have seen the actual packet loss.  It is sent following the\
    \ same\n   timing rule as sending NACK, defined in RFC 4585 [RFC4585].  The RTCP\n\
    \   TPLR message may be sent in a regular full compound RTCP packet or in\n  \
    \ an early RTCP packet, as per the RTP/AVPF rules.  Intermediaries in\n   the\
    \ network that receive an RTCP TPLR MUST NOT send their own\n   additional Third-Party\
    \ Loss Report messages for the same packet\n   sequence numbers.  They SHOULD\
    \ simply forward the RTCP TPLR message\n   received from upstream to the receiver(s).\
    \  Additionally, they may\n   generate their own RTCP TPLR that reports a set\
    \ of the losses they\n   see, which are different from ones reported in the RTCP\
    \ TPLR they\n   received.  The RTCP TPLR does not have retransmission request\n\
    \   [RFC4588] semantics.\n   When a receiver gets an RTCP TPLR message, it MUST\
    \ follow the rules\n   for NACK suppression in RFC 4585 [RFC4585] and refrain\
    \ from sending a\n   feedback request (e.g., NACK or FIR) for the missing packets\
    \ reported\n   in the message, which is dealt with in the same way as receiving\
    \ a\n   NACK.\n   To increase the robustness to the loss of a TPLR, the RTCP TPLR\
    \ may\n   be retransmitted.  If the additional TPLR arrives at the receiver,\n\
    \   the receiver SHOULD deal with the additional TPLR in the same way as\n   receiving\
    \ the first TPLR for the same packet, and no additional\n   behavior for receiver\
    \ is required.\n   A receiver may have sent a feedback message according to the\
    \ RTP/AVPF\n   scheduling algorithm of RFC 4585 [RFC4585] before receiving an\
    \ RTCP\n   TPLR message, but further feedback messages for those sequence\n  \
    \ numbers SHOULD be suppressed after receiving the RTCP TPLR.  Nodes\n   that\
    \ do not understand the RTCP TPLR message will ignore it and might\n   therefore\
    \ still send feedback according to the AVPF scheduling\n   algorithm of RFC 4585\
    \ [RFC4585].  The media source or intermediate\n   nodes cannot be certain that\
    \ the use of an RTCP TPLR message actually\n   reduces the amount of feedback\
    \ they receive.\n"

    \ [RFC4585],\n   the feedback type \"nack\", without parameters, indicates use\
    \ of the\n   Generic NACK feedback format as defined in Section 6.2.1 of RFC 4585\n\
    \   [RFC4585].  In this document, we define two parameters that indicate\n   the\
    \ third-party loss supported for use with \"nack\", namely:\n   o  \"tllei\" denotes\
    \ support of Transport-Layer Third-Party Loss Early\n      Indication.\n   o \
    \ \"pslei\" denotes support of Payload-Specific Third-Party Loss Early\n     \
    \ Indication.\n   The ABNF for these two parameters for use with \"nack\" is defined\
    \ here\n   (please refer to Section 4.2 of RFC4585 [RFC4585] for complete ABNF\n\
    \   syntax).\n           rtcp-fb-val        =/ \"nack\" rtcp-fb-nack-param\n \

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations documented in [RFC4585]\
    \ are also\n   applicable for the TPLR messages defined in this document.\n  \
    \ More specifically, spoofed or maliciously created TPLR feedback\n   messages\
    \ cause missing RTP packets to not be repaired in a timely\n   fashion and add\
    \ risk of (undesired) feedback suppression at RTCP\n   receivers that accept such\
    \ TPLR messages.  Any packet loss detected\n   by a receiver that also receives\
    \ a TPLR message for the same missing\n   packet(s) will negatively impact the\
    \ application that relies on the\n   (timely) RTP retransmission capabilities.\n\
    \   A solution to prevent such attack with maliciously sent TPLR messages\n  \
    \ is to apply an authentication and integrity protection framework for\n   the\
    \ feedback messages.  This can be accomplished using the RTP\n   profile that\
    \ combines Secure RTP [RFC3711] and AVPF into SAVPF\n   [RFC5124].\n   Note that\
    \ intermediaries that are not visible at the RTP layer that\n   wish to send the\
    \ Third-Party Loss Reports on behalf of the media\n   source can only do so if\
    \ they spoof the SSRC of the media source.\n   This is difficult if SRTP is in\
    \ use.  If the intermediary is visible\n   at the RTP layer, this is not an issue,\
    \ provided the intermediary is\n   part of the security context for the session.\n"
