  - "Abstract\n   In most RTP-based multicast applications, the RTP source sends inter-\n
    \  related data.  Due to this interdependency, randomly joining RTP\n   receivers
    usually cannot start consuming the multicast data right\n   after they join the
    session.  Thus, they often experience a random\n   acquisition delay.  An RTP
    receiver can use one or more different\n   approaches to achieve rapid acquisition.
    \ Yet, due to various\n   factors, performance of the rapid acquisition methods
    usually varies.\n   Furthermore, in some cases, the RTP receiver can do a simple\n
    \  multicast join (in other cases, it is compelled to do so).  For\n   quality
    reporting, monitoring, and diagnostic purposes, it is\n   important to collect
    detailed information from the RTP receivers\n   about their acquisition and presentation
    experiences.  This document\n   addresses this issue by defining a new report
    block type, called the\n   Multicast Acquisition (MA) report block, within the
    framework of RTP\n   Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports (XRs) (RFC 3611).
    \ This\n   document also defines the necessary signaling of the new MA report\n
    \  block type in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is the out-of-band control
    protocol\n   for applications that use the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
    for\n   media transport [RFC3550].  In addition to providing minimal control\n
    \  functionality to RTP entities, RTCP also enables a basic-level\n   monitoring
    of RTP sessions via sender and receiver reports.  More\n   statistically detailed
    monitoring as well as application-specific\n   monitoring are usually achieved
    through the RTCP Extended Reports\n   (XRs) [RFC3611].\n   In most RTP-based multicast
    applications such as the ones carrying\n   video content, the RTP source sends
    inter-related data.\n   Consequently, the RTP application may not be able to decode
    and\n   present the data in an RTP packet before decoding the data in one or\n
    \  more earlier RTP packets and/or before acquiring some Reference\n   Information
    about the content itself.  Thus, RTP receivers that are\n   randomly joining a
    multicast session often experience a random\n   acquisition delay.  In order to
    reduce this delay, [RFC6285] proposes\n   an approach where an auxiliary unicast
    RTP session is established\n   between a retransmission server and the joining
    RTP receiver.  Over\n   this unicast RTP session, the retransmission server provides
    the\n   Reference Information, which is all the information the RTP receiver\n
    \  needs to rapidly acquire the multicast stream.  This method is\n   referred
    to as the Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions\n   (RAMS).  However, depending
    on the variability in the Source\n   Filtering Group Management Protocol (SFGMP)
    processing times, the\n   availability of network resources for rapid acquisition,
    and the\n   nature of the RTP data, not all RTP receivers can acquire the\n   multicast
    stream in the same amount of time.  The performance of\n   rapid acquisition may
    vary not only for different RTP receivers but\n   also over time.\n   To increase
    the visibility of the multicast service provider in its\n   network, to diagnose
    slow multicast acquisition issues, and to\n   collect the acquisition experiences
    of the RTP receivers, this\n   document defines a new report block type, which
    is called the\n   Multicast Acquisition (MA) report block, within the framework
    of RTCP\n   XR.  RTP receivers that use the method described in [RFC6285] may
    use\n   this report every time they join a new multicast RTP session.  RTP\n   receivers
    that use a different method for rapid acquisition or those\n   that do not use
    any method but rather do a simple multicast join may\n   also use this report.
    \ This way, the multicast service provider can\n   quantitatively compare the
    improvements achieved by different\n   methods.\n"

  - "4.  Multicast Acquisition (MA) Report Block\n   This section defines the format
    of the MA report block.  The base\n   report is payload independent.  An extension
    mechanism is provided\n   where further optional payload-independent and payload-specific\n
    \  information can be included in the report as desired.\n   The OPTIONAL extensions
    that are defined in this document are\n   primarily developed for the method presented
    in [RFC6285].  Other\n   methods that provide rapid acquisition can define their
    own\n   extensions to be used in the MA report block.\n   The packet format for
    the RTCP XR is defined in Section 2 of\n   [RFC3611].  Each XR packet has a fixed-length
    field for version,\n   padding, reserved bits, payload type (PT), length, synchronization\n
    \  source (SSRC) of packet sender as well as a variable-length field for\n   report
    blocks.  In the XR packets, the PT field is set to XR (207).\n   It is better
    to send the MA report block after all the necessary\n   information is collected
    and computed.  Partial reporting is\n   generally not useful as it cannot give
    the full picture of the\n   multicast acquisition, and it causes additional complexity
    in terms\n   of report block matching and correlation.  The MA report block is\n
    \  only sent as a part of an RTCP compound packet, and it is sent in the\n   primary
    multicast session.\n   The need for reliability of the MA report block is not
    any greater\n   than other report blocks or types.  If desired, the report block\n
    \  could be repeated for redundancy purposes while respecting the RTCP\n   scheduling
    algorithms.\n   Following the rules specified in [RFC3550], all integer fields
    in the\n   base report and extensions defined below are carried in network-byte\n
    \  order, that is, most significant byte (octet) first, also known as\n   big-endian.
    \ Unless otherwise stated, numeric constants are in\n   decimal (base 10).\n"

      in Section 7.5.  If the new status code is\n      intended to be used privately
      by a vendor, there is no need for\n      IANA management.  Section 4.2.2 defines
      how a vendor defines and\n      uses private extensions to convey its messages.\n
      \     To indicate use of a private extension, the RTP receiver MUST set\n      the
      Status field to zero.  A private extension MUST NOT be used in\n      an XR

        \ The status code\n   reported in the base report MUST always be within the
        scope of the\n   particular MA method specified in the MA Method field.\n
        \  In certain MA methods, the RTP receiver can generate a status code\n   for
        its multicast acquisition attempt or can be told by another\n   network element
        or RTP endpoint what the current status is via a\n   response code.  In such
        cases, the RTP receiver MAY report the value\n   of the received response
        code as its status code if the response code\n   has a higher priority.  Each
        MA method needs to outline the rules\n   pertaining to its response and status
        codes so that RTP receiver\n   implementations can determine what to report

        \ If the RTP receiver receives a 1xx- or 2xx-\n   level response code, then

        or 5xx-level response code (indicating\n   receiver-side and server-side errors,

        the unicast burst\n   and/or the primary multicast stream.  These are explained
        below.\n   o  Application Request-to-RAMS Request Delta Time (32 bits): OPTIONAL\n

        extensions in TLV\n   format.  The range of [128-254] of TLV Types is reserved
        for private\n   extensions.  IANA management for these extensions is unnecessary;\n

        use the structure depicted in Figure 3 for private\n   extensions.  Here,

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of [RFC3611] apply
    in this document as\n   well.\n   The information contained in MA reports could
    be stolen as with any\n   other RTCP reports if proper protection mechanism(s)
    are not in\n   place.  If desired, similar to other RTCP XRs, the MA reports MAY
    be\n   protected by using Secure RTP (SRTP) and Secure RTP Control Protocol\n
    \  (SRTCP) [RFC3711].\n   Malicious sniffing or otherwise obtaining MA report
    blocks can reveal\n   performance characteristics of the RTP service and underlying\n
    \  network.  This information is mostly available to an observer with\n   the
    ability to capture RTP and RTCP session traffic.  The contents\n   and value of
    any private extension need to be studied when\n   considering the necessity to
    secure the MA reports since application-\n   level performance data might be present
    that is not otherwise\n   available to an attacker, as with the required fields
    and vendor-\n   neutral extensions.\n   Using the MA reports to provide feedback
    into the acquisition of the\n   multicast streams can introduce possible additional
    security\n   implications.  If a forged or otherwise modified MA report is\n   received
    for an earlier acquisition attempt, invalid data can be used\n   as input in later
    rapid acquisition attempts.  For example,\n   incorrectly small SFGMP join times
    could cause the unicast burst to\n   be too short, leading to gaps in sequence
    numbers in the approach\n   discussed in [RFC6285].  Additionally, forged reports
    could give the\n   appearance that rapid acquisition is performing correctly when
    it is\n   in fact failing, or vice versa.  While integrity protection can be\n
    \  achieved in different ways, we RECOMMEND the use of SRTCP [RFC3711].\n"
