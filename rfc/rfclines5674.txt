Abstract This document describes how to send alarm information in syslog.
It includes the mapping of ITU perceived severities onto syslog message fields.
It also includes a number of alarm specific SD PARAM definitions from X.733 and the IETF Alarm MIB.
In addition to sending out alarm information asynchronously via protocols such as the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) or the Network Configuration Protocol (Netconf), many implementations also log alarms via syslog.
This memo defines a set of SD PARAMs to support logging and defines a mapping of syslog severity to the severity of the alarm.
The Alarm MIB [RFC3877] includes mandatory alarm fields from X.733 [X.733] as well as information from X.736 [X.736].
In additional, the Alarm MIB introduces its own alarm fields.
This memo reuses terminology and fields from the Alarm MIB.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
Alarm related terminology is defined in [RFC3877].
SD ID, SD PARAM, and other syslog related terms are defined in [RFC5424].
The Alarm MIB [RFC3877] defines
ITU perceived severities; it is useful to be able to relate these to the syslog message fields, particularly in the case where alarms are being logged.
This memo describes the representation of ITU perceived severities in appropriate syslog fields, which are described in [RFC5424].
Syslog offers both a so called SEVERITY as well as STRUCTURED DATA.
Due to constraints in syslog, there is no one to one mapping possible for SEVERITY.
A STRUCTURED DATA element is defined in this document to allow inclusion of the unmodified ITU perceived severity.
Syslog supports Severity values different from ITU perceived severities.
These are defined in Section 6.2.1 of [RFC5424].
The mapping shown in Table 1 below SHOULD be used to map ITU perceived severities to syslog severities.
ITUPerceivedSeverity to Syslog SEVERITY Mapping 3.
Alarm STRUCTURED DATA Elements STRUCTURED DATA allows the inclusion of any structured information into a syslog message.
The following are defined in this document to support the structuring of alarm information.
Event Type  Perceived Severity  Trend Indication  Resource URI Support of the "alarm" SD ID is optional but, once supported, some of the SD PARAMS are mandatory.
If the "alarm" SD ID is included, the "resource" SD PARAM MUST be included.
This item uniquely identifies the resource under alarm within the scope of a network element.
If the "alarm" SD ID is included, the "probableCause" SD PARAM MUST be included.
This parameter is the mnemonic associated with the IANAItuProbableCause object defined within [RFC3877] and any subsequent extensions defined by IANA.
For example, IANAItuProbableCause defines a transmission failure to a probable cause of 'transmissionError (10)'.
The value of the parameter in this case would be 'transmissionError'.
If the "alarm" SD ID is included, the "perceivedSeverity" SD PARAM MUST be included.
Similar to the definition of perceived severity in [X.736] and [RFC3877], this object can take the following values:  cleared  indeterminate  critical  major
See Section 2 for the relationship between this severity and syslog severity.
If the "alarm" SD ID is included, the "eventType" SD PARAM SHOULD be included.
This parameter is the mnemonic associated with the IANAItuEventType object defined within [RFC3877] and any subsequent extensions defined by IANA.
For example, IANAItuEventType defines an environmental alarm to an event type of 'environmentalAlarm (6)'.
The value of the parameter in this case would be 'environmentalAlarm'.
If the "alarm" SD ID is included, the "trendIndication" SD PARAM SHOULD be included.
Similar to the definition of perceived severity in [X.733] and [RFC3877], this object can take the following values:  moreSevere
If the "alarm" SD ID is included, the "resourceURI" SD PARAM SHOULD be included.
This item uniquely identifies the resource under alarm.
The value of this field MUST conform to the URI definition in [RFC3986] and its updates.
In the case of an SNMP resource, the syntax in [RFC4088] MUST be used and "resourceURI" must point to the same resource as alarmActiveResourceId [RFC3877] for this alarm.
Both the "resource" and the "resourceURI" parameters point at the resource experiencing the alarm, but the "resourceURI" has syntactic constraint requiring it to be a URI.
This makes it easy to correlate this syslog alarm with any alarms that are received via other protocols, such as SNMP, or to use SNMP or other protocols to get additional information about this resource.
Examples Example 1 Mandatory Alarm Information <165>1 2003 10
evntslog ID47 [exampleSDID@32473 iut "3" eventSource  "Application" eventID "1011"][alarm resource "su root" probableCause "unauthorizedAccessAttempt" perceivedSeverity "major"]
BOMAn application event log entry...
In this example, extended from [RFC5424], the VERSION is 1 and the Facility has the value of 4.
The message was created on 11 October 2003 at 10:14:15pm UTC, 3 milliseconds into the next second.
The message originated from a host that identifies itself as "mymachine.example.com".
The APP NAME is "evntslog" and the PROCID is unknown.
The alarm SD ID contains the mandatory SD  PARAMS of resource, probableCause, and preceivedSeverity.
The MSG itself is "An application event log entry..."
The BOM at the beginning of the MSG indicates UTF 8 encoding.
Example 2 Additional Alarm Information <165>1 2004
11 10T20:15:15.003Z mymachine.example.com evntslog ID48 [alarm resource "interface 42
" probableCause "unauthorizedAccessAttempt" perceivedSeverity "major" eventType "communicationsAlarm" resourceURI "snmp://example.com//1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.42"]
In this example, we include two optional alarm fields: eventType and resourceURI.
In addition to the general syslog security considerations discussed in [RFC5424], the information contained with alarms may provide hackers with helpful information about parts of the system currently experiencing stress as well as general information about the system, such as inventory.
Users should not have access to information in alarms that their normal access permissions would not permit if the information were accessed in another manner.
There is no standardized access control model for syslog, and hence the ability to filter alarms based on a notion of a receiver identity is, at best, implementation specific.
IANA Considerations IANA registered the syslog Structured Data ID values and PARAM NAMEs shown below:
