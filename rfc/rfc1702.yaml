- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   In an earlier memo [RFC 1701], we described GRE, a mechanism\
    \ for\n   encapsulating arbitrary packets within an arbitrary transport\n   protocol.\
    \  This is a companion memo which describes the use of GRE\n   with IP.  This\
    \ memo addresses the case of using IP as the delivery\n   protocol or the payload\
    \ protocol and the special case of IP as both\n   the delivery and payload.  This\
    \ memo also describes using IP\n   addresses and autonomous system numbers as\
    \ part of a GRE source\n   route.\n"

    \ Type field of 0x800.\n   For the Address Family value of 0x800, the Routing\
    \ Information field\n   will consist of a list of IP addresses and indicates an\
    \ IP source\n   route.  The first octet of the Routing Information field constitute\
    \ a\n   8 bit integer offset from the start of the Source Route Entry (SRE),\n\
    \   called the SRE Offset.  The SRE Offset indicates the first octet of\n   the\

- title: IP as both delivery and payload protocol
  contents:
  - "IP as both delivery and payload protocol\n   When IP is encapsulated in IP, the\
    \ TTL, TOS, and IP security options\n   MAY be copied from the payload packet\
    \ into the same fields in the\n   delivery packet.  The payload packet's TTL MUST\
    \ be decremented when\n   the packet is decapsulated to insure that no packet\
    \ lives forever.\n"
- title: IP source routes
  contents:
  - "IP source routes\n   When a system is processing a SRE with an Address Family\
    \ indicating\n   an IP source route, it MUST use the SRE Offset to determine the\
    \ next\n   destination IP address.  If the next IP destination is this system,\n\
    \   the SRE Offset field should be increased by four (the size of an IP\n   address).\
    \  If the SRE Offset is equal to the SRE Length in this SRE,\n   then the Offset\
    \ field in the GRE header should be adjusted to point\n   to the next SRE (if\
    \ any).  This should be repeated until the next IP\n   destination is not this\
    \ system or until the entire SRE has been\n   processed.\n   If the source route\
    \ is incomplete, then the Strict Source Route bit\n   is checked.  If the source\
    \ route is a strict source route and the\n   next IP destination is NOT an adjacent\
    \ system, the packet MUST be\n   dropped.  Otherwise, the system should use the\
    \ IP address indicated\n   by the Offset field to replace the destination address\
    \ in the\n   delivery header and forward the packet.\n"
- title: Autonomous system source routes
  contents:
  - "Autonomous system source routes\n   When a system is processing a SRE with an\
    \ Address Family indicating\n   an AS source route, it MUST use the SRE Offset\
    \ field to determine the\n   next autonomous system.  If the next autonomous system\
    \ is the local\n   autonomous system, the SRE Offset field should be increased\
    \ by two\n   (the size of an autonomous system number).  If the SRE Offset is\n\
    \   equal to the SRE Length in this SRE, then the Offset field in the GRE\n  \
    \ header should be adjusted to point to the next SRE (if any).  This\n   should\
    \ be repeated until the next autonomous system number is not\n   equal to the\
    \ local autonomous system number or until the entire SRE\n   has been processed.\n\
    \   If the source route is incomplete, then the Strict Source Route bit\n   is\
    \ checked.  If the source route is a strict source route and the\n   next autonomous\
    \ system is NOT an adjacent autonomous system, the\n   packet should be dropped.\
    \  Otherwise, the system should use the\n   autonomous system number indicated\
    \ by the SRE Offset field to replace\n   the destination address in the delivery\
    \ header and forward the\n   packet.  The exact mechanism for determining the\
    \ next delivery\n   destination address given the AS number is outside of the\
    \ scope of\n   this document.\n"
