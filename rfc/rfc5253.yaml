  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document provides an applicability statement on the\
    \ use of\n   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocols and\n\
    \   mechanisms to Basic Mode Layer 1 Virtual Private Networks (L1VPNs) as\n  \
    \ specified in [RFC4847].\n   The operation of L1VPNs is divided into the Basic\
    \ Mode and the\n   Enhanced Mode.  The Basic Mode of operation does not feature\
    \ any\n   exchange of routing information between the Layer 1 network and the\n\
    \   customer domain, while the Enhanced Mode of operation features\n   exchange\
    \ of routing information between the Layer 1 network and the\n   customer domain.\n\
    \   The main GMPLS protocols and mechanisms applicable to the L1VPN Basic\n  \
    \ Mode are described in [RFC5251], [RFC5195], and [RFC5252], along with\n   several\
    \ other documents referenced within this document.\n   Note that discussion in\
    \ this document is focused on areas where GMPLS\n   protocols and mechanisms are\
    \ relevant.\n"

- title: 2.  Basic Mode Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  Basic Mode Overview\n   As described in [RFC4847], in the Basic Mode service\
    \ model, there is\n   no routing exchange between the Customer Edge (CE) and the\
    \ Provider\n   Edge (PE).  CE-to-CE L1VPN connections (i.e., the CE-to-CE VPN\n\
    \   connection in RFC 4847) are set up by GMPLS signaling between the CE\n   and\
    \ the PE, and then across the provider network.  A L1VPN connection\n   is limited\
    \ to the connection between CEs belonging to the same L1VPN.\n   Note that in\
    \ L1VPNs, routing operates within the provider network.\n   Also note that routing\
    \ may be used by PEs to exchange information\n   specific to the L1VPNs supported\
    \ by the provider network (e.g.,\n   membership information).\n   In the L1VPN\
    \ Basic Mode, the provider network is completely under the\n   control of the\
    \ provider.  This includes the PE-to-PE segment of the\n   CE-to-CE L1VPN connection\
    \ that is controlled and computed by the\n   provider (PE-to-PE segment control).\
    \  On the other hand, the L1VPN\n   itself, constructed from a set of CEs and\
    \ the L1VPN connections\n   provided by the provider, is under the control of\
    \ each customer.\n   This control includes that a customer can request between\
    \ which CEs a\n   connection is to be established (topology control).  Note that\
    \ a\n   customer may outsource the management of its L1VPN to a third party,\n\
    \   including to the provider itself.  There is a confidentiality\n   requirement\
    \ between the provider and each customer.\n   [RFC5251], which extends [RFC4208],\
    \ specifies GMPLS signaling to\n   establish CE-to-CE L1VPN connections.\n   [RFC5195]\
    \ and [RFC5252] specify alternative mechanisms to exchange\n   L1VPN membership\
    \ information between PEs, based on BGP and OSPF,\n   respectively.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Data Plane\n   The provider network can be constructed from any type of\
    \ Layer 1\n   switches, such as Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) switches, Optical\n\
    \   Cross-Connects (OXCs), or Photonic Cross-Connects (PXCs).\n   Furthermore,\
    \ a PE may be an Ethernet Private Line (EPL) type of\n   device, that maps Ethernet\
    \ frames onto Layer 1 connections (by means\n   of Ethernet over TDM, etc.). \
    \ The provider network may be constructed\n   from switches providing a single\
    \ switching granularity (e.g., only\n   VC3 switches), or from switches providing\
    \ multiple switching\n   granularities (e.g., from VC3/VC4 switches, or from VC3\
    \ switches and\n   OXCs).  The provider network may provide a single type of L1VPN\n\
    \   connection (e.g., VC3 connections only), or multiple types of\n   connection\
    \ (e.g., VC3/VC4 connections, or VC3 connections and\n   wavelength connections).\n\
    \   A CE does not have to have the capability to switch at Layer 1, but\n   it\
    \ must be capable of receiving a Layer 1 signal and either switching\n   it or\
    \ terminating it with adaptation.\n   As described in [RFC4847] and [RFC5251],\
    \ a CE and a PE are connected\n   by one or more links.  A CE may also be connected\
    \ to more than one\n   PE, and a PE may have more than one CE connected to it.\n\
    \   A CE may belong to a single L1VPN, or to multiple L1VPNs, and a PE\n   may\
    \ support one or more L1VPNs through a single CE or through\n   multiple CEs.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Control Plane
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Control Plane\n   The provider network is controlled by GMPLS.  L1VPN Basic\
    \ Mode\n   provider networks are limited to a single AS within the scope of this\n\
    \   document.  Multi-AS Basic Mode L1VPNs are for future study.\n   As described\
    \ in [RFC4847] and [RFC5251], a CE and a PE need to be\n   connected by at least\
    \ one control channel.  It is necessary to\n   disambiguate control plane messages\
    \ exchanged between a CE and a PE\n   if the CE-to-PE relationship is applicable\
    \ to more than one L1VPN.\n   This makes it possible to determine to which L1VPN\
    \ such control plane\n   messages apply.  Such disambiguation can be achieved\
    \ by allocating a\n   separate control channel to each L1VPN (either using a separate\n\
    \   physical channel, a separate logical channel such as an IP tunnel, or\n  \
    \ using separate addressing).\n   GMPLS allows any type of control channel to\
    \ be used, as long as there\n   is IP level reachability.  In the L1VPN context,\
    \ instantiation of a\n   control channel between a CE and a PE may differ depending\
    \ on\n   security requirements, etc.  This is discussed in Section 8.\n"
- title: 4.  Addressing
  contents:
  - "4.  Addressing\n   As described in [RFC5251], the L1VPN Basic Mode allows that\
    \ customer\n   addressing realms overlap with each other, and also overlap with\
    \ the\n   service provider addressing realm.  That is, a customer network may\n\
    \   reuse addresses used by the provider network, and may reuse addresses\n  \
    \ used in another customer network supported by the same provider\n   network.\
    \  This is the same as in any other VPN model.\n   In addition, the L1VPN Basic\
    \ Mode allows CE-to-PE control channel\n   addressing realms to overlap.  That\
    \ is, a CE-to-PE control channel\n   address (CE's address of this control channel\
    \ and PE's address of\n   this control channel) is unique within the L1VPN that\
    \ the CE-to-PE\n   control channel belongs to, but not necessarily unique across\n\
    \   multiple L1VPNs.\n   Furthermore, once a L1VPN connection has been established,\
    \ the L1VPN\n   Basic Mode does not enforce any restriction on address assignment\
    \ for\n   this L1VPN connection (treated as a link) for customer network\n   operation\
    \ (e.g., IP network, MPLS network).\n"

- title: 5.1.  Provisioning Model
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Provisioning Model\n   As described in [RFC5251], for each L1VPN that has\
    \ at least one\n   customer-facing port on a given PE, the PE maintains a Port\n\
    \   Information Table (PIT) associated with that L1VPN.  A PIT provides a\n  \
    \ cross-reference between Customer Port Indices (CPIs) and Provider\n   Port Indices\
    \ (PPIs) and contains a list of <CPI, PPI> tuples for all\n   the ports within\
    \ the L1VPN.  In addition, for local PE ports of a\n   given L1VPN, the PE retains\
    \ an identifier known as the VPN-PPI, and\n   this is stored in the PIT with the\
    \ <CPI, PPI> tuples.\n   When a new CE belonging to one or more L1VPNs is added\
    \ to a PE, PIT\n   entries associated to those L1VPNs need to be configured on\
    \ the PE.\n   Section 4 of [RFC5251] specifies such procedures:\n   - If no PIT\
    \ exists for the L1VPN on the PE, a new PIT is created by\n     the provider and\
    \ associated with the VPN identifier.\n   - The PIT (new or pre-existing) is updated\
    \ to include information\n     related to the newly added CE.  The VPN-PPI, PPI,\
    \ and CPI are\n     installed in the PIT.  Note that the PPI is well-known by\
    \ the PE,\n     but the CPI must be discovered either through manual configuration\n\
    \     or automatically by mechanisms such as the Link Management Protocol\n  \
    \   (LMP) [RFC4204].  In addition, a CE-to-PE control channel needs to\n     be\
    \ configured.\n   - The updated PIT information needs to be configured in the\
    \ PITs on\n     the remote PE associated with the L1VPN.  For such purposes, manual\n\
    \     configuration or some sort of auto-discovery mechanisms can be\n     used.\
    \  [RFC5195] and [RFC5252] specify alternative auto-discovery\n     mechanisms.\n\
    \   - In addition, remote PIT information associated with the L1VPN needs\n  \
    \   to be configured on this PE if the PIT has been newly created.\n     Again,\
    \ this can be achieved through manual configuration or through\n     auto-discovery;\
    \ see [RFC5195] and [RFC5252].\n   When L1VPN membership of an existing CE changes,\
    \ or when a CE is\n   removed from a PE, similar procedures need to be applied\
    \ to update\n   the local and remote PITs.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.2.1.  Path Computation and Establishment\n   A PE-to-PE segment of a CE-to-CE\
    \ L1VPN connection may be established\n   based on various policies.  Those policies\
    \ can be applied per L1VPN\n   or per L1VPN connection.  The policy is configured\
    \ by the provider,\n   possibly based on the contracts with each customer.\n \
    \  Examples of PE-to-PE segment connection establishment polices\n   supported\
    \ in the L1VPN Basic Mode are as follows.\n   - Policy 1: On-demand establishment,\
    \ on-demand path computation\n   - Policy 2: On-demand establishment, pre-computed\
    \ path\n   - Policy 3: Pre-establishment, pre-computed path\n   In each policy,\
    \ the PE-to-PE path may be computed by the local PE or\n   by a path computation\
    \ entity outside of the local PE (e.g., a Path\n   Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655]\
    \ or a management system).\n   In policies 2 and 3, pre-computation of paths (and\
    \ pre-establishment\n   if applicable) can be done at the network planning phase,\
    \ or just\n   before signaling (e.g., triggered by an off-line customer request).\n\
    \   As the result of pre-computation (and pre-establishment), there could\n  \
    \ be multiple PE-to-PE segments for a specific pair of PEs.  When a PE\n   receives\
    \ a Path message from a CE for a L1VPN connection, a PE needs\n   to determine\
    \ which PE-to-PE segment to use.  In such cases, the\n   provider may want to\
    \ control:\n   - Which L1VPN uses which PE-to-PE L1VPN segment.\n   - Which CE-to-CE\
    \ L1VPN connection uses which PE-to-PE L1VPN segment.\n   The former requires\
    \ mapping between the PIT and the PE-to-PE segment.\n   The latter requires some\
    \ more sophisticated mapping method, for\n   example:\n   - Mapping between individual\
    \ PIT entries and PE-to-PE segments.\n   - Use of a Path Key ID [CONF-SEG] supplied\
    \ by the provider to the CE,\n     and signaled by the CE as part of the L1VPN\
    \ connection request.\n   The L1VPN Basic Mode does not preclude usage of other\
    \ methods, if\n   applicable.\n   In policy 3, stitching or nesting is necessary\
    \ in order to map the\n   CE-to-CE L1VPN connection to a pre-established PE-to-PE\
    \ segment.\n"

    \   on the contracts with each customer.\n   For example, a provider may choose\

    \ setup failure due to lack of\n   resources or incompatible switching capabilities\
    \ on remote CE-to-PE\n   TE links.\n   Furthermore, the L1VPN Basic Mode allows\

    \ waste signaling effort within the network as L1VPN\n   connections are pointlessly\

- title: 6.2.  Note on Routing
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Note on Routing\n   A CE needs to obtain the remote CPI to which it wishes\
    \ to request a\n   connection.  Since, in the L1VPN Basic Mode, there is no routing\n\
    \   information exchange between a CE and a PE, there is no dynamic\n   mechanism\
    \ supported as part of the Basic Mode L1VPN service, and the\n   knowledge of\
    \ remote CPIs must be acquired in a L1VPN-specific way,\n   perhaps through configuration\
    \ or through a directory server.\n   If an L1VPN is used by a customer to operate\
    \ a private IP network,\n   the customer may wish to form routing adjacencies\
    \ over the CE-to-CE\n   L1VPN connections.  The L1VPN Basic Mode does not enforce\
    \ any\n   restriction on such operation by a customer, and the use made of the\n\
    \   L1VPN connections is transparent to the provider network.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ if an L1VPN is used by a customer to operate a private\n   Multiprotocol Label\
    \ Switching (MPLS) or GMPLS network, the customer\n   may wish to treat a L1VPN\
    \ connection as a TE link, and this requires\n   a CE-to-CE control channel. \
    \ Note that a Forwarding Adjacency\n   [RFC4206] cannot be formed from the CE-to-CE\
    \ L1VPN connection in the\n   Basic Mode because there is no routing exchange\
    \ between CE and PE.\n   That is, the customer network and the provider network\
    \ do not share a\n   routing instance, and the customer control channel cannot\
    \ be carried\n   within the provider control plane.  But where the CE provides\n\
    \   suitable adaptation (for example, where the customer network is a\n   packet-\
    \ switched MPLS or GMPLS network), the customer control channel\n   may be in-band\
    \ and a routing adjacency may be formed between the CEs\n   using the L1VPN connection.\
    \  Otherwise, CE-to-CE control plane\n   connectivity may form part of the L1VPN\
    \ service provided to the\n   customer by the provider and may be achieved within\
    \ the L1VPN\n   connection (for example, through the use of overhead bytes) or\n\
    \   through a dedicated control channel connection or tunnel.  The\n   options\

  - "7.1.  Scalability\n   There are several factors that impact scalability.\n  \
    \ o Number of L1VPNs (PITs) configured on each PE\n     With the increase of this\
    \ number, information to be maintained on\n     the PE increases.  Theoretically,\
    \ the upper limit of the number of\n     L1VPNs supported in a provider network\
    \ is governed by how the ID\n     associated with a L1VPN is allocated, and the\

    \     implementations may impose arbitrary limits on the number of PITs\n    \
    \ supported by any one PE.\n   o Number of CE-to-PE TE links for each L1VPN\n\
    \     With the increase of this number, information to be maintained in\n    \

    \ increase of this number, information to be maintained on\n     each PE/P increases.\
    \  When stitching or nesting is used, the state\n     to be maintained at each\
    \ PE increases compared to when connectivity\n     is achieved without stitching\
    \ or nesting.\n     However, in a Layer 1 core, this number is always bounded\
    \ by the\n     available physical resource because each LSP uses a separate label\n\
    \     which is directly bound to a physical, switchable resource\n     (timeslot,\
    \ lambda, or fiber).  Thus, it can be safely assumed that\n     the PEs/Ps can\
    \ comfortably handle the number of LSPs that they may\n     be called on to switch\
    \ for a L1VPN.\n"

- title: 8.1.  Topology Confidentiality
  contents:
  - "8.1.  Topology Confidentiality\n   As specified in [RFC5251], a provider's topology\
    \ confidentiality is\n   preserved by the Basic Mode.  Since there is no routing\
    \ exchange\n   between PE and CE, the customer network can gather no information\n\
    \   about the provider network.  Further, as described in Section 4 of\n   [RFC4208],\
    \ a PE may filter the information present in a Record Route\n   Object (RRO) that\
    \ is signaled from the provider network to the\n   customer network.  In addition,\
    \ as described in Section 5 of\n   [RFC4208] and Section 4.4 of [RFC5251], when\
    \ a Notify message is sent\n   to a CE, it is possible to hide the provider internal\
    \ address.  This\n   is accomplished by a PE updating the Notify Node Address\
    \ with its own\n   address when the PE receives a NOTIFY_REQUEST object from the\
    \ CE.\n   Even in the case of pre-computed and/or pre-signaled PE-to-PE\n   segments,\
    \ provider topology confidentiality may be preserved through\n   the use of path\
    \ key IDs [CONF-SEG].\n   The customer's topology confidentiality cannot be completely\
    \ hidden\n   from the provider network.  At the least, the provider network will\n\
    \   know about the addresses and locations of CEs.  Other customer\n   topology\
    \ information will remain hidden from the provider in the\n   Basic Mode, although\
    \ care may be needed to protect the customer\n   control channel as described\
    \ in Section 8.4.\n   The provider network is responsible for maintaining confidentiality\n\
    \   of topology information between customers and across L1VPNs.  Since\n   there\
    \ is no distribution of routing information from PE to CE in the\n   Basic Mode,\
    \ there is no mechanism by which the provider could\n   accidentally, or deliberately\
    \ but automatically, distribute this\n   information.\n"
- title: 8.2.  External Control of the Provider Network
  contents:
  - "8.2.  External Control of the Provider Network\n   The provider network is protected\
    \ from direct control from within\n   customer networks through policy and through\
    \ filtering of signaling\n   messages.\n   There is a service-based policy installed\
    \ at each PE that directs how\n   a PE should react to a L1VPN connection request\
    \ received from any CE.\n   Each CE is configured at the PE (or through a policy\
    \ server) for its\n   membership of a L1VPN, and so CEs cannot dynamically bind\
    \ to a PE or\n   join a L1VPN.  With this configuration comes the policy that\
    \ tells\n   the PE how to react to a L1VPN connection request (for example,\n\
    \   whether to allow dynamic establishment of PE-to-PE connections).\n   Thus,\
    \ the provider network is protected against spurious L1VPN\n   connection requests\
    \ and can charge for all L1VPN connections\n   according to the service agreement\
    \ with the customers.  Hence, the\n   provider network is substantially protected\
    \ against denial-of-service\n   (DoS) attacks.\n   At the same time, if a Path\
    \ message from a CE contains an Explicit\n   Route Object (ERO) specifying the\
    \ route within provider network, it\n   is rejected by the PE.  Thus, the customer\
    \ network has no control\n   over the resources in the provider network.\n"
- title: 8.3.  Data Plane Security
  contents:
  - "8.3.  Data Plane Security\n   As described in [RFC4847], at Layer 1, data plane\
    \ information is\n   normally assumed to be secure once connections are established\
    \ since\n   the optical signals themselves are normally considered to be hard\
    \ to\n   intercept or modify, and it is considered difficult to insert data\n\
    \   into an optical stream.  The very use of an optical signal may be\n   considered\
    \ to provide confidentiality and integrity to the payload\n   data.  Furthermore,\
    \ as indicated in [RFC4847], L1VPN connections are\n   each dedicated to a specific\
    \ L1VPN by which an additional element of\n   security for the payload data is\
    \ provided.\n   Misconnection remains a security vulnerability for user data.\
    \  If a\n   L1VPN connection were to be misconnected to the wrong destination,\n\
    \   user data would be delivered to the wrong consumers.  In order to\n   protect\
    \ against mis-delivery, each L1VPN connection is restricted to\n   use only within\
    \ a single L1VPN.  That is, a L1VPN connection does not\n   connect CEs that are\
    \ in different L1VPNs.  In order to realize this,\n   the identity of CEs is assured\
    \ as part of the service contract.  And\n   upon receipt of a request for connection\
    \ setup, the provider network\n   assures that the connection is requested between\
    \ CEs belonging to the\n   same L1VPN.  This is achieved as described in Section\
    \ 5.3.\n   Furthermore, users with greater sensitivity to the security of their\n\
    \   payload data should apply appropriate security measures within their\n   own\
    \ network layer.  For example, a customer exchanging IP traffic\n   over a L1VPN\
    \ connection may choose to use IPsec to secure that\n   traffic (i.e., to operate\
    \ IPsec on the CE-to-CE exchange of IP\n   traffic).\n"
- title: 8.4 Control Plane Security
  contents:
  - "8.4 Control Plane Security\n   There are two aspects for control plane security.\n\
    \   First, the entity connected over a CE-to-PE control channel must be\n   identified.\
    \  This is done when a new CE is added as part of the\n   service contract and\
    \ the necessary control channel is established.\n   This identification can use\
    \ authentication procedures available in\n   RSVP-TE [RFC3209].  That is, control\
    \ plane entities are identified\n   within the core protocols used for signaling,\
    \ but are not\n   authenticated unless the authentication procedures of [RFC3209]\
    \ are\n   used.\n   Second, it must be possible to secure communication over a\
    \ CE-to-PE\n   control channel.  If a communication channel between the customer\
    \ and\n   the provider (control channel, management interface) is physically\n\
    \   separate per customer, the communication channel could be considered\n   as\
    \ secure.  However, when the communication channel is physically\n   shared among\
    \ customers, security mechanisms need to be available and\n   should be enforced.\
    \  RSVP-TE [RFC3209] provides for tamper-protection\n   of signaling message exchanges\
    \ through the optional Integrity object.\n   IPsec tunnels can be used to carry\
    \ the control plane messages to\n   further ensure the integrity of the signaling\
    \ messages.\n   Note that even in the case of physically separate communication\n\
    \   channels, customers may wish to apply security mechanisms, such as\n   IPsec,\
    \ to assure higher security, and such mechanisms must be\n   available.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ the provider network needs mechanisms to detect DoS\n   attacks and to protect\
    \ against them reactively and proactively.  In\n   the Basic Mode, this relies\
    \ on management systems.  For example,\n   management systems collect and analyze\
    \ statistics on signaling\n   requests from CEs, and protect against malicious\
    \ behaviors where\n   necessary.\n   Lastly, it should be noted that customer\
    \ control plane traffic\n   carried over the provider network between CEs needs\
    \ to be protected.\n   Such protection is normally the responsibility of the customer\n\
    \   network and can use the security mechanisms of the customer signaling\n  \
    \ and routing protocols (for example, RSVP-TE [RFC3209]) or may use\n   IPsec\
    \ tunnels between CEs.  CE-to-CE control plane security may form\n   part of the\
    \ data plane protection where the control plane traffic is\n   carried in-band\
    \ in the L1VPN connection.  Where the CE-to-CE control\n   plane connectivity\
    \ is provided as an explicit part of the L1VPN\n   service by the provider, control\
    \ plane security should form part of\n   the service agreement between the provider\
    \ and customer.\n"
- title: 9.  Manageability Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Manageability Considerations\n   Manageability considerations are described\
    \ in [RFC4847].  In the\n   L1VPN Basic Mode, we rely on management systems for\
    \ various aspects\n   of the different service functions, such as fault management,\n\
    \   configuration and policy management, accounting management,\n   performance\
    \ management, and security management (as described in\n   Section 8).\n   In\
    \ order to support various management functionalities, MIB modules\n   need to\
    \ be supported.  In particular, the GMPLS TE MIB (GMPLS-TE-STD-\n   MIB) [RFC4802]\
    \ can be used for GMPLS-based traffic engineering\n   configuration and management,\
    \ while the TE Link MIB (TE-LINK-STD-MIB)\n   [RFC4220] can be used for configuration\
    \ and management of TE links.\n"
