  - "Abstract\n   Routing protocols have been extended over time to use cryptographic\n\
    \   mechanisms to ensure that data received from a neighboring router has\n  \
    \ not been modified in transit and actually originated from an\n   authorized\
    \ neighboring router.\n   The cryptographic mechanisms defined to date and described\
    \ in this\n   document rely on a digest produced with a hash algorithm applied\
    \ to\n   the payload encapsulated in the routing protocol packet.\n   This document\
    \ outlines some of the limitations of the current\n   mechanism, problems with\
    \ manual keying of these cryptographic\n   algorithms, and possible vectors for\

- title: 1.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "1.  Problem Statement\n   Protocols, such as OSPF version 2 [RFC2328], version\
    \ 3 [RFC5340],\n   IS-IS [RFC1195], BGP-4 [RFC4271], and BFD [RFC5880], employ\
    \ various\n   mechanisms to create a cryptographic digest of each transmitted\n\
    \   protocol packet.  Traditionally, these digests are the results of a\n   one-way\
    \ hash algorithm, such as Message Digest 5 (MD5) [RFC1321],\n   across the contents\
    \ of the packet being transmitted.  A secret key is\n   used as the hash base\
    \ (or seed).  The digest is then recomputed by\n   the receiving router, using\
    \ the same key as the original router used\n   to create the hash, then compared\
    \ with the transmitted digest to\n   verify:\n   o  That the router originating\
    \ this packet is authorized via the\n      shared key mechanism to peer with the\
    \ local router and exchange\n      routing data.  The implicit trust of the routing\
    \ protocol exchange\n      protected by a shared secret is intended to protect\
    \ against the\n      injection of falsely generated routing data into the routing\n\
    \      system by unauthorized systems.\n   o  That the data has not been altered\
    \ in transit between the two\n      neighboring routers.\n   Digest verification\
    \ schemes are not intended to protect the\n   confidentiality of information being\
    \ exchanged between routers.  The\n   information (entries in the routing table)\
    \ is potentially available\n   through other mechanisms.  Moreover, access to\
    \ the physical media\n   between two routers exchanging routing data will confer\
    \ the ability\n   to capture or otherwise discover the contents of the routing\
    \ tables\n   in those routers.\n   Authentication mechanisms defined today have\
    \ notable limitations:\n   o  Manual configuration of shared secret keys, especially\
    \ in large\n      networks and between networks, poses a major management problem.\n\
    \      In many cases, it is challenging to replace keys without\n      significant\
    \ coordination or disruption.\n   o  In some cases, when manual keys are configured,\
    \ some forms of\n      replay protection are no longer possible, allowing the\
    \ routing\n      protocol to be attacked through the replay of captured routing\n\
    \      messages.\n   This document outlines some of the problems with manual keying\
    \ of\n   these cryptographic algorithms.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Pre-Image vs. Collision Attacks
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Pre-Image vs. Collision Attacks\n   A pre-image attack (an attempt to find\
    \ new data with the same hash\n   value) would enable someone to find an input\
    \ message that causes a\n   hash function to produce a particular output.  In\
    \ contrast, a\n   collision attack finds two messages with the same hash, but\
    \ the\n   attacker can't pick what the message will be.  Feasible collision\n\
    \   attacks against MD4, MD5, HAVAL-128, and RIPEMD have been documented\n   in\
    \ [Crypto2004].\n   The ability to produce a collision does not currently introduce\
    \ any\n   obvious or known attacks on routing protocols.  Pre-image attacks\n\
    \   have the potential to cause problems in the future; however, due to\n   the\
    \ message length, there are serious limitations to the feasibility\n   of mounting\
    \ such an attack.\n   Protocols themselves have some built-in protection against\
    \ collision\n   attacks.  This is because a lot of values for fields in a protocol\n\
    \   packet are invalid or will produce an unusable packet.  For example,\n   in\
    \ OSPF the Link State Advertisement (LSA) type can be from 1 to 11.\n   Any other\
    \ value in the field will result in the packet being\n   discarded.\n   Assume\
    \ two packets M and M' are generated and have the same hash.\n   The above condition\
    \ will further reduce the ability to produce a\n   message that is also a correct\
    \ message from the protocol perspective,\n   as a lot of potential values are\
    \ themselves not valid.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Concerns about MD5 and the SHA-1 Algorithm
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Concerns about MD5 and the SHA-1 Algorithm\n   There are published concerns\
    \ about the overall strength of the MD5\n   algorithm ([Dobb96a], [Dobb96b], [Wang04]).\
    \  While those published\n   concerns apply to the use of MD5 in other modes (e.g.,\
    \ use of MD5\n   X.509v3/PKIX digital certificates), they are not an attack upon\
    \ Keyed\n   MD5 and Hash-based Message Authentication Code MD5 (HMAC-MD5), which\n\
    \   is what the current routing protocols have specified.  There are also\n  \
    \ published concerns about the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) algorithm\n   ([Wang05],\
    \ [Philip01], [Prav01], [Prav02], [Arjen05]) and also\n   concerns about the MD5\
    \ and SHA algorithms in the HMAC [RFC2104] mode\n   ([RR07], [RR08]).  The National\
    \ Institute of Standards and Technology\n   (NIST) will be supporting HMAC-SHA-1\
    \ even after 2010 [NISTHmacSHA],\n   whereas it will drop support for SHA-1 in\
    \ digital signatures.  NIST\n   also recommends application and protocol designers\
    \ move to the SHA-2\n   family of hash functions (i.e., SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384\
    \ and\n   SHA-512) for all new applications and protocols.\n   However, as explained\
    \ above, such attacks are currently not\n   applicable to the routing protocols.\
    \  Separately, some organizations\n   (e.g., the US government) prefer NIST algorithms,\
    \ such as the SHA\n   family, over other algorithms (like MD5) for local policy\
    \ reasons.\n"

  - "2.  Open Shortest Path First Version 2 (OSPFv2)\n   OSPF [RFC2328] describes\
    \ the use of an MD5 digest with OSPF packets.\n   MD5 keys are manually configured.\
    \  The OSPF packet header includes an\n   authentication type field as well as\
    \ 64 bits of data for use by the\n   appropriate authentication scheme.  OSPF\
    \ also provides for a non-\n   decreasing sequence number to be included in each\

    \ Digital Signatures\" [RFC2154] is an Experimental RFC that\n   describes extensions\
    \ to OSPF to digitally sign its Link State\n   Advertisements (LSAs).  It is believed\
    \ that if stronger\n   authentication and security is required, then OSPF (and\

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Management Issues with OSPFv2\n   According to the OSPF specification [RFC2328],\

- title: 2.2.  Technical Issues with OSPFv2
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Technical Issues with OSPFv2\n   While OSPF provides relatively strong\
    \ protection through the\n   inclusion of MD5 digests, with additional data and\
    \ sequence numbers\n   in transmitted packets, there are still attacks against\
    \ OSPF:\n   o  The sequence number is initialized to zero when forming an\n  \
    \    adjacency with a newly discovered neighbor.  When an adjacency is\n     \
    \ brought down, the sequence number is also set to zero.  If the\n      cryptographically\
    \ protected packets of a router that is brought\n      down (for administrative\
    \ or other reasons) are replayed by a\n      malicious router, traffic could be\
    \ forced through the malicious\n      router.  A malicious router might then induce\
    \ routing loops, or\n      intercept or blackhole the traffic.\n   o  OSPF allows\
    \ multiple packets with the same sequence number.  This\n      means that it's\
    \ possible to replay the same packet many times\n      before the next legitimate\
    \ packet is sent.  An attacker may resend\n      the same packet repeatedly until\
    \ the next Hello packet is\n      transmitted and received.  The Hello interval,\
    \ which is unknown,\n      determines the attack window.\n   o  OSPF does not\
    \ require the use of any particular hash algorithm;\n      however, only the use\
    \ of MD5 digests for authentication and replay\n      protection is specified\
    \ in RFC 2328.  Most OSPF implementations\n      only support MD5 in addition\
    \ to Null and Simple Password\n      authentication.\n      Recently, limitations\
    \ in collision-resistance properties of the\n      MD5 and SHA-1 hash functions\
    \ have been discovered; [RFC4270]\n      summarizes the discoveries.  There have\
    \ been attacks against the\n      use of MD5 as a hash; while these attacks do\
    \ not directly apply to\n      the use of MD5 in routing protocols, it is prudent\
    \ to have other\n      options available.  For this reason, the general use of\
    \ these\n      algorithms should be discouraged, and [RFC5709] adds support for\n\
    \      using SHA-1 and SHA-2 with the HMAC construct for OSPF.\n   o  OSPF on\
    \ a broadcast network shares the same key between all\n      neighbors on that\
    \ broadcast network.  Some OSPF packets are sent\n      to a multicast address.\n\
    \      Spoofing by any malicious neighbor possessing credentials or\n      replayable\
    \ packets is therefore very easy.  Possession of the key\n      itself is used\
    \ as an identity validation, and no other identity\n      check is used.  A malicious\
    \ neighbor could send a packet, forging\n      the identity of the sender as being\
    \ from another neighbor.  There\n      would be no way in which the victim could\
    \ distinguish the identity\n      of the packet sender.\n   o  In some OSPF implementations,\
    \ neighbors on broadcast, non-\n      broadcast multi-access (NBMA), and point-to-multipoint\
    \ networks\n      are identified by the IP address in the IP header.  The IP header\n\
    \      is not covered by the MAC in the cryptographic authentication\n      scheme\
    \ as described in RFC 2328, and an attack can be made to\n      exploit this omission.\n\
    \      Assume the following scenario.\n      R1 sends an authenticated HELLO to\
    \ R2.  This HELLO is captured and\n      replayed back to R1.  The source IP in\
    \ the IP header of the\n      replayed packet is changed to that of R2.\n    \
    \  R1, not finding itself in the HELLO, would deduce that the\n      connection\
    \ is not bidirectional and would bring down the\n      adjacency.\n"

  - "3.  Open Shortest Path First Version 3 (OSPFv3)\n   OSPFv3 [RFC5340] relies on\
    \ the IP Authentication Header (AH)\n   [RFC4302] and the IP Encapsulating Security\
    \ Payload (ESP) [RFC4303]\n   to cryptographically sign routing information passed\
    \ between routers.\n   When using ESP, the null encryption algorithm [RFC2410]\
    \ is used, so\n   the data carried in the OSPFv3 packets is signed, but not encrypted.\n\
    \   This provides data origin authentication for adjacent routers, and\n   data\

- title: 3.1.  Management Issues with OSPFv3
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Management Issues with OSPFv3\n   The OSPFv3 security document (\"Authentication/Confidentiality\
    \ for\n   OSPFv3\" [RFC4552]) discusses, at length, the reasoning behind using\n\
    \   manually configured keys, rather than some automated key management\n   protocol\
    \ such as IKEv2 [RFC4306].  The primary problem is the lack of\n   a suitable\
    \ key management mechanism, as OSPF adjacencies are formed\n   on a one-to-many\
    \ basis and most key management mechanisms are\n   designed for a one-to-one communication\
    \ model.  This forces the\n   system administrator to use manually configured\
    \ security associations\n   (SAs) and cryptographic keys to provide the authentication\
    \ and, if\n   desired, confidentiality services.\n   Regarding replay protection,\
    \ [RFC4552] states that:\n      Since it is not possible using the current standards\
    \ to provide\n      complete replay protection while using manual keying, the\
    \ proposed\n      solution will not provide protection against replay attacks.\n\
    \   In the OSPFv3 case, the primary administrative issue with manually\n   configured\
    \ SAs and keys is the management issue -- maintaining shared\n   sets of keys\
    \ on all routers within a network.  As with OSPFv2,\n   rekeying is an infrequent\
    \ event requiring coordination. [RFC4552]\n   does not require that all OSPFv3\
    \ routers have the same key configured\n   for every neighbor, so each set of\
    \ neighbors connected to a given\n   link could have a different key configured.\
    \  While this makes it\n   easier to change the keys (by forcing the system administrator\
    \ to\n   only change the keys on the routers on a single link), the process of\n\
    \   manual configuration for all the routers in a network to change the\n   keys\
    \ used for OSPFv3 digests and confidentiality on a periodic basis\n   can be difficult.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Technical Issues with OSPFv3
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Technical Issues with OSPFv3\n   The primary technical concern with the\
    \ current specifications for\n   OSPFv3 is that when manual SA and key management\
    \ is used as specified\n   in \"Sequence Number Generation\", Section 3.3.2 of\
    \ [RFC4302]: \"The\n   sender assumes anti-replay is enabled as a default, unless\
    \ otherwise\n   notified by the receiver (see Section 3.4.3) or if the SA was\n\
    \   configured using manual key management\".  Replaying OSPFv3 packets\n   can\
    \ induce several failures in a network, including:\n   o  Replaying Hello packets\
    \ with an empty neighbor list can cause all\n      the neighbor adjacencies with\
    \ the sending router to be reset,\n      disrupting network communications.\n\
    \   o  Replaying Hello packets from early in the designated router\n      election\
    \ process on broadcast links can cause all the neighbor\n      adjacencies with\
    \ the sending router to be reset, disrupting\n      network communications.\n\
    \   o  Replaying database description (DB-Description) packets can cause\n   \
    \   all FULL neighbor adjacencies with the sending router to be reset,\n     \
    \ disrupting network communications.\n   o  Replaying link state request (LS-Request)\
    \ packets can cause all\n      FULL neighbor adjacencies with the sending router\

    \ adjacency process (from two-way all the way to\n      FULL state), and then\
    \ replaying this process when the router is no\n      longer attached can cause\
    \ a false adjacency to be formed, allowing\n      an attacker to attract traffic.\n\

    \ on that network.  Some OSPF packets are sent to a\n      multicast address.\n\
    \      Spoofing by a malicious neighbor is very easy.  Possession of the\n   \
    \   key itself is used as an identity check.  There is no other\n      identity\
    \ check used.  A neighbor could send a packet specifying\n      the packet came\

    \ Hello packets or the IS-IS Hellos (IIHs) that are used to\n        discover\
    \ neighbors, and\n      - the Sequence Number Packets (SNPs).\n   As described\
    \ in IS-IS [RFC1195], a list of known neighbors is\n   included in each Hello\
    \ transmitted by an intermediate system to\n   ensure two-way communications with\
    \ any specific neighbor before\n   exchanging link state databases.\n   IS-IS\
    \ does not provide a sequence number.  IS-IS packets are\n   vulnerable to replay\
    \ attacks; any packet can be replayed at any point\n   of time.  So long as the\
    \ keys used are the same, protocol elements\n   that would not be rejected will\
    \ affect existing sessions.\n   A Hello packet containing a digest within a TLV\
    \ and an empty neighbor\n   list could be replayed, resulting in all adjacencies\
    \ with the\n   original transmitting intermediate system to be restarted.\n  \
    \ A replay of an old Complete Sequence Number Packet (CSNP) could cause\n   LSPs\
    \ to be flooded, resulting in an LSP storm.\n   IS-IS specifies the use of the\
    \ HMAC-MD5 and HMAC-SHA-1 to protect\n   IS-IS packets.\n   IS-IS does not have\
    \ a notion of Key ID.  During key rollover, each\n   message received has to be\
    \ checked for integrity against all keys\n   that are valid.  A denial-of-service\
    \ (DoS) attack may be induced by\n   sending IS-IS packets with random hashes.\
    \  This will cause the IS-IS\n   packet to be checked for authentication with\
    \ all possible keys,\n   increasing the amount of processing required.  This issue,\
    \ however,\n   has been fixed in the recent [RFC5310], which introduces the concept\n\
    \   of Key IDs in IS-IS.\n   Recently, limitations in collision-resistance properties\
    \ of the MD5\n   and SHA-1 hash functions have been discovered; [RFC4270] summarizes\n\
    \   the discoveries.  There have been attacks against the use of MD5 as a\n  \
    \ hash; while these attacks do not directly apply to the use of\n   HMAC-MD5 in\
    \ IS-IS, it is prudent to have other options available.\n   For this reason, the\
    \ general use of these algorithms should be\n   discouraged, and [RFC5310] adds\
    \ support for using HMAC-SHA with\n   IS-IS.\n   IS-IS on a broadcast network\
    \ shares the same key between all\n   neighbors on that network.\n   This makes\
    \ spoofing by a malicious neighbor easy since IS-IS packets\n   are sent to a\
    \ link-layer multicast address.  Possession of the key\n   itself is used as an\
    \ authorization check.  A neighbor could send a\n   packet spoofing the identity\
    \ of a neighbor, and there would be no way\n   in which the attacked router could\
    \ discern the identity of the\n   malicious packet sender.\n   The Remaining Lifetime\
    \ field in the LSP is not covered by the\n   authentication.  An IS-IS router\
    \ can receive its own self-generated\n   LSP segment with zero lifetime remaining.\
    \  In that case, if it has a\n   copy with non-zero lifetime, it purges that LSP,\
    \ i.e., it increments\n   the current sequence number and floods all the segments\
    \ again.  This\n   is much worse in IS-IS than in OSPF because there is only one\
    \ LSP\n   other than the pseudonode LSPs for the LANs on which the IS-IS router\n\
    \   is the Designated Intermediate System (DIS).\n   In this way, an attacker\
    \ can force the router to flood all segments\n   -- potentially a large number\
    \ if the number of routes is large.  It\n   also causes the sequence number of\
    \ all the LSPs to increase fast.  If\n   the sequence number increases to the\
    \ maximum (0xFFFFFFFF), the IS-IS\n   process must shut down for around 20 minutes\
    \ (the product of MaxAge +\n   ZeroAgeLifetime) to allow the old LSPs to age out\
    \ of all the router\n   databases.\n"

    \  Note that TCP MD5 does not preclude rekeying during a\n   connection, but does\
    \ not require its support either.  Further, TCP-AO\n   supports key changes with\

    \   authority, two BGP peers may be in different administrative domains,\n   having\
    \ different policies for key strength, rollover frequency, etc.\n   An autonomous\

- title: 6.1.  Technical Issues with RIP
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Technical Issues with RIP\n   o  The sequence number used by a router is\
    \ initialized to zero at\n      startup, and is also set to zero whenever the\
    \ neighbor is brought\n      down.  If the cryptographically protected packets\
    \ of a router that\n      is brought down (for administrative or other reasons)\
    \ are stored\n      by a malicious router, the new router could replay the packets\n\
    \      from the previous session, thus forcing traffic through the\n      malicious\
    \ router.  Dropping of such packets by the router could\n      result in blackholes.\
    \  Also, forwarding wrong packets could result\n      in routing loops.\n   o\
    \  RIPv2 allows multiple packets with the same sequence number.  This\n      could\
    \ mean the same packet may be replayed many times before the\n      next legitimate\
    \ packet is sent.  An attacker may resend the same\n      packet repeatedly until\
    \ the next Hello packet is transmitted and\n      received, which means the Hello\
    \ interval therefore determines the\n      attack window.\n   o  RIPv2 [RFC2453]\

    \ in [RFC2082].\n      Support for Keyed MD5 was mandated to ensure compatability\
    \ with\n      legacy implementations.\n   o  \"RIPv2 Cryptographic Authentication\"\
    \ [RFC4822] does not cover the\n      UDP and the IP headers.  It is therefore\
    \ possible for an attacker\n      to modify some fields in the above headers without\
    \ routers\n      becoming aware of it.\n      There is limited exposure to modification\
    \ of the UDP header, as\n      the RIP protocol uses only it to compute the length\

    \ RIP\n      authentication to fail the RIP authentication, thereby limiting\n\
    \      exposure.\n      RIP uses the source IP address from the IP header to determine\n\
    \      which RIP neighbor it has learnt the RIP Update from.  Changing\n     \
    \ the source IP address can be used by an attacker to disrupt the\n      RIP routing\
    \ sessions between two routers R1 and R2, as shown in\n      the following examples.\n\
    \      Scenario 1:\n      R1 sends an authenticated RIP message to R2 with a cryptographic\n\
    \      sequence number X.\n      The attacker then needs a packet with a higher\
    \ sequence number\n      originated by R2 either, from this session or from some\
    \ earlier\n      session.\n      The attacker can then replay this packet to R2\
    \ by changing the\n      source IP to that of R1.\n      R2 would then no longer\
    \ accept any more RIP Updates from R1, as\n      those would have a lower cryptographic\
    \ sequence number.  After 180\n      seconds (or less), R2 would consider R1 timed\
    \ out and bring down\n      the RIP session.\n      Scenario 2:\n      R1 announces\
    \ a route with cost C1 to R2.  This packet can be\n      captured by an attacker.\
    \  Later, if this cost changes and R1\n      announces this with a different cost\
    \ C2, the attacker can replay\n      the captured packet, modifying the source\
    \ IP to a new arbitrary IP\n      address, thereby masquerading as a different\
    \ router.\n      R2 will accept this route and the router as a new gateway, and\
    \ R2\n      would then use the non-existent router as a next hop for that\n  \
    \    network.  This would only be effective if the cost C1 is less than\n    \
    \  C2.\n"

- title: 7.1.  Technical Issues with BFD
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Technical Issues with BFD\n   o  The level of security provided is based\
    \ on the Authentication Type\n      used.  However, the authentication algorithms\
    \ defined are MD5 or\n      SHA-1 based.  As mentioned earlier, MD5 and SHA-1\
    \ are both known\n      to be vulnerable to collision attacks.\n   o  The BFD\
    \ specification mentions mechanisms to allow for the change\n      of authentication\
    \ state based on the state of a received packet.\n      This can cause a denial-of-service\
    \ attack where a malicious\n      authenticated packet (stored from a past session)\
    \ can be relayed\n      over a session that does not use authentication.  This\
    \ causes one\n      end to assume that authentication is enabled at the other\
    \ end, and\n      hence the BFD adjacency is dropped.  This would be a harder\
    \ attack\n      to put forth when meticulously keyed authentication is in use.\n\
    \   o  BFD works on microsecond timers.  When malicious packets are sent\n   \
    \   at short intervals, with the authentication bit set, it can cause\n      a\
    \ DoS attack.\n   o  BFD allows a mode called the echo mode.  Echo packets are\
    \ not\n      defined in the BFD specification, though they can keep the BFD\n\
    \      session up.  There are no guidelines on the properties of the echo\n  \
    \    packets beyond the choice of the source and destination addresses.\n    \
    \  While the BFD specification recommends applying security\n      mechanisms\
    \ to prevent spoofing of these packets, there are no\n      guidelines on what\
    \ type of mechanisms are appropriate.\n      Any security issues in the echo mode\
    \ will directly affect the BFD\n      protocol and session states, and hence the\
    \ network stability.  The\n      potential effects and remedies as understood\
    \ today are somewhat\n      limited, however.  For instance, any replay attacks\
    \ would be\n      indistinguishable from normal forwarding of the tested router.\
    \  An\n      attack would still cause a faulty link to be believed to be up,\n\
    \      but there is little that can be done about it.  However, if the\n     \
    \ echo packets are guessable, it may be possible to spoof from an\n      external\
    \ source and cause BFD to believe that a one-way link is\n      really bidirectional.\
    \  As a result, it is important that the echo\n      packets contain random material\
    \ that is also checked upon\n      reception.\n   o  BFD packets can be sent at\
    \ millisecond intervals (the protocol\n      uses timers at microsecond intervals).\
    \  When using authentication,\n      this can cause frequent sequence number wrap-around\
    \ as a 32-bit\n      sequence number is used, thus considerably reducing the security\n\
    \      of the authentication algorithms.\n   o  Recently, limitations in collision-resistance\
    \ properties of the\n      MD5 and SHA-1 hash functions have been discovered;\
    \ [RFC4270]\n      summarizes the discoveries.  There have been attacks against\
    \ the\n      use of MD5 as a hash; while these attacks do not directly apply to\n\
    \      the use of HMAC-MD5 and keyed SHA-1 in BFD, it is prudent to have\n   \
    \   other options available.  Such attacks do not mean that BFD using\n      SHA-1\
    \ for authentication is at risk.  However, it does mean that\n      SHA-1 should\
    \ be replaced as soon as possible and should not be\n      used for new applications.\n\
    \      It should be noted that if SHA-1 is used in the Hashed Message\n      Authentication\
    \ Code (HMAC) [RFC2104] construction, then collision\n      attacks currently\
    \ known against SHA-1 do not apply.  The new\n      attacks on SHA-1 have no impact\
    \ on the security of HMAC-SHA-1.\n      There are already proposals [GenBFDAuth]\
    \ that add support for HMAC\n      with the SHA-1 and SHA-2 family of hash functions\
    \ for BFD.\n"
