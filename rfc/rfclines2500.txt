This memo summarizes the status of Internet protocols and specifications.
It is published by the RFC Editor in accordance with Section 2.1 of "The Internet Standards Process   Revision 3", RFC 2026, which specifies the rules and procedures by which all Internet stnadards are set.
This memo is prepared by the RFC Editor for the IESG and IAB.
It is a member of a series of summary memos that are published approximately every one hundred RFCs; please see www.rfc editor.org.
This memo lists the level and status of the archival documents known as RFCs (Request for Comments) within the Internet standards process.
The reader is urged to review RFC 2026 for essential context for interpreting this memo.
The following introductory text is quoted directly from RFC 2026: "The Internet, a loosely organized international collaboration of autonomous, interconnected networks, supports host to host communication through voluntary adherence to open protocols and procedures defined by Internet Standards.
There are also many isolated interconnected networks, which are not connected to the global Internet but use the Internet Standards.
The Internet Standards Process described in this document is concerned with all protocols, procedures, and conventions that are used in or by the Internet, whether or not they are part of the TCP/IP protocol suite.
In the case of protocols developed and/or standardized by non Internet organizations, however, the Internet Standards Process normally applies to the application of the protocol or procedure in the Internet context, not to the specification of the protocol itself.
In general, an Internet Standard is a specification that is stable and well
understood, is technically competent, has multiple, independent, and interoperable implementations with substantial operational experience, enjoys significant public support, and is recognizably useful in some or all parts of the Internet.
Each distinct version of an Internet standards related specification is published as part of the "Request for Comments" (RFC) document series.
This archival series is the official publication channel for Internet standards documents and other publications of the IESG, IAB, and Internet community.
RFCs can be obtained from a number of Internet hosts using anonymous FTP, gopher, World Wide Web, and other Internet document retrieval systems.
The rules for formatting and submitting an RFC are defined in [5].
Every RFC is available in ASCII text.
Some RFCs are also available in other formats.
The other versions of an RFC may contain material (such as diagrams and figures) that is not present in the ASCII version, and it may be formatted differently.
The status of Internet protocol and service specifications is summarized periodically in an RFC entitled "Internet Official Protocol Standards" [1].
This RFC shows the level of maturity and other helpful information for each Internet protocol or service specification (see section 3).
Specifications subject to the Internet Standards Process fall into one of two categories:  Technical Specification (TS) and Applicability Statement (AS).
Some RFCs document Internet Standards.
These RFCs form the "STD" subseries of the RFC series [4].
When a specification has been adopted as an Internet Standard, it is given the additional label "STDxxx", but it keeps its RFC number and its place in the RFC series.
Some RFCs standardize the results of community deliberations about statements of principle or conclusions about what is the best way to perform some operations or IETF process function.
These RFCs form the specification has been adopted as a BCP, it is given the additional label "BCPxxx", but it keeps its RFC number and its place in the RFC series.
(see section 5) Not all specifications of protocols or services for the Internet
should or will become Internet Standards or BCPs.
Such non  standards track specifications are not subject to the rules for Internet standardization.
Non standards track specifications may be published directly as "Experimental" or "Informational" RFCs at the discretion of the RFC Editor in consultation with the IESG (see section 4.2).
Section 2 of this memo lists all Technical Specification RFCs that are in the standards track, and Section 3 lists Applicability Statement RFCs in the standards track.
Section 4 lists those protocol specification RFCs that are off the standards track (Informational and Historic status).
This memo does not list Informational RFCs that may be of general interest to the community but do not specify protocols for the Internet.
It also does not list BCP RFCs.
Telnet options have been added into the lists.
Current Technical Specifications Subsections 2.1 2.5 list the standards in groups by protocol state.
In the following lists, shorthand nicknames have been shown for many of the major protocols.
These names are commonly used in discourse on Internet mailing lists.
