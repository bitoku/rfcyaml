  - "1.  Introduction\n   To kick start the Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344] processing of its\
    \ packets by\n   Mobile IP agents, a mobile node (MN) needs to be able to acquire\
    \ a\n   pair of home and care of addresses (HoA and CoA, respectively), find\n\
    \   a willing agent to act as a Home Agent (HA) for the MN and perform a\n   registration\
    \ process with the HA.  The registration process consists\n   of an exchange of\
    \ a registration request and a registration reply\n   message between the MN and\
    \ the HA.  The specification in [RFC3344]\n   allows an MN to start the registration\
    \ process prior to having\n   acquired its home address or the address of its\
    \ HA.  Acquiring those\n   parameters by the MN is typically part of a process\
    \ referred to as\n   bootstrapping.\n   Successful processing of registration\
    \ request and reply messages,\n   among other things, depends on successful creation\
    \ and verification\n   of a number of authentication extensions developed specifically\
    \ to\n   protect the integrity and security of these messages and the entities\n\
    \   processing them, i.e., MN, HA and some times, Foreign Agents (FAs)\n   [RFC3344].\
    \  Creation as well as verification of these extensions\n   requires existence\
    \ of trust relationships and shared keys between MN\n   and each of the mobility\
    \ agents.  However, creation of these trust\n   relationships, typically referred\
    \ to as mobility security\n   associations (MSAs), is considered outside the scope\
    \ of the base\n   Mobile IPv4 specification defined in [RFC3344].  Avoiding the\n\
    \   scalability issues arising from creating static security associations\n  \
    \ between an MN and all possible mobility agents is desired.  Thus,\n   establishing\
    \ the associations dynamically, using the pre-existing\n   relationship between\
    \ the MN and the AAA server, is preferred.\n   To allow for utilization of an\
    \ existing AAA infrastructure in the\n   bootstrapping of the Mobile IPv4 parameters\
    \ and security\n   relationships, the Mobile IPv4 working group has developed\
    \ Mobile\n   IPv4 extensions to allow the MN to authenticate to the home AAA\n\
    \   server [RFC4721].  The extensions also allow the MN to request\n   assistance\
    \ from the AAA server in creation of mobility security\n   associations [RFC3957]\
    \ with the mobility agents, using the pre-\n   established trust relationship\
    \ between the MN and its home AAA\n   server.\n   While Mobile IPv4 extensions\
    \ are necessary for implementing a\n   utilization of the AAA infrastructure for\
    \ Mobile IPv4 purposes, they\n   are not sufficient.  The interaction between\
    \ the MN and the mobility\n   agents (HA and FA) is based on Mobile IP signaling.\
    \  However, the\n   signaling beyond the mobility agents to the AAA server is\
    \ typically\n   based on AAA protocols.  Around the time, when the specification\
    \ of\n   the aforementioned Mobile IP extensions was being developed, the AAA\n\
    \   community was in the process of designing a successor to RADIUS.\n   Thus,\
    \ the Mobile IP group developed a set of guidelines and\n   requirements from\
    \ the Mobile IP standpoint [RFC2977] specifically for\n   such a successor (which\
    \ turned out to be Diameter).  These\n   requirements led to the development of\
    \ a specification for using\n   Diameter in Mobile IPv4 bootstrapping [RFC4004].\
    \  The requirements\n   for Mobile IP Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting\
    \ [RFC2977]\n   were standardized after the standardization of RADIUS [RFC2865].\n\
    \   Thus, it is obvious that RADIUS does not and cannot meet all the\n   requirements\
    \ listed in [RFC2977] without undergoing an extensive\n   design change.  Consequently,\
    \ within IETF no RADIUS attributes have\n   been standardized for Mobile IP support\
    \ thus far.  However, in the\n   absence of IETF standardized RADIUS attributes,\
    \ different wireless\n   SDOs have taken the path of developing Vendor Specific\
    \ Attributes\n   (VSAs) for providing Mobile IPv4 support.  The use of different\n\
    \   vendor specific RADIUS attributes and procedures for the same purpose\n  \
    \ of Mobile IPv4 bootstrapping at different SDOs is deemed to cause a\n   lack\
    \ interoperability between these wireless standards, potentially\n   hindering\
    \ mobility across these wireless networks.\n   To respond to the described issue,\
    \ it is desired to standardize a set\n   of RADIUS attributes within IETF to allow\
    \ a consistent and\n   interoperable interaction with RADIUS based AAA infrastructure\
    \ during\n   the Mobile IPv4 Registration procedure.  The bootstrapping attributes\n\
    \   can include configuration parameters as well as material used for\n   provisioning\
    \ security of Mobile IPv4 messaging (authentication) as\n   defined by [RFC4721]\
    \ and [RFC3957].\n   As it stands today, RADIUS cannot meet all the requirements\
    \ in\n   [RFC2977].  The purpose of these requirements is to define a set of\n\
    \   goals and non-goals specifically for RADIUS when it comes to\n   assisting\
    \ mobile nodes and mobility agents in bootstrapping Mobile\n   IPv4 operation.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Goals
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Goals\n   The scope of the work is to standardize RADIUS attributes and\
    \ to\n   define the procedure by which the Mobile IPv4 agents (e.g., Home\n  \
    \ agent (HA) and Foreign Agent (FA)) map the Mobile IP registration\n   message\
    \ fields into the proposed RADIUS attributes, and vice versa.\n   o  RADIUS servers\
    \ are REQUIRED to be able to understand and process\n      the attributes to be\
    \ defined for Mobile IPv4 support and to\n      perform verification of authentication\
    \ extensions specified in\n      [RFC4721].  RADIUS proxies are expected to be\
    \ able to forward\n      messages including the Mobile IPv4 related attributes\
    \ as they\n      would with any other RADIUS messages and attributes.\n   o  All\
    \ RADIUS work MUST be backward compatible with existing RADIUS\n      RFCs, including\
    \ RFCs the following: [RFC2865], [RFC2866],\n      [RFC2867], [RFC2868], [RFC2869],\
    \ [RFC3576], [RFC3579], and\n      [RFC3580].\n   o  Mobile IP agents (FA and\
    \ HA) are REQUIRED to operate as RADIUS\n      clients (NASes in context of [RFC2865])\
    \ when translating RADIUS\n      signaling into Mobile IP signaling, and vice\
    \ versa.  Details on\n      the behavior of Mobile IP agents as RADIUS clients\
    \ are to be\n      provided by the solution document describing the RADIUS extensions\n\
    \      for Mobile IP support.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Non-Goals
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Non-Goals\n   The scope of this work is to only standardize RADIUS attributes\
    \ and\n   to define the procedure by which the Mobile IPv4 agents (e.g., Home\n\
    \   agent (HA) and Foreign Agent (FA)) map the Mobile IP registration\n   message\
    \ fields into the proposed RADIUS attributes, and vice versa.\n   Extension of\
    \ the functionality of the existing protocol or RADIUS\n   servers is not intended.\
    \  More specifically, the following are NON-\n   GOALS:\n   o  Enhancing RADIUS\
    \ Security: Creating new security properties for\n      RADIUS, such as creating\
    \ key transport capabilities is not the\n      goal.  No new security mechanisms\
    \ are to be defined for the\n      transport of RADIUS Access Requests in relation\
    \ to the support of\n      Mobile IPv4 bootstrapping.  Existing RADIUS authentication\n\
    \      procedures, e.g., Message-Authenticator (80) described in\n      [RFC2869],\
    \ are used.  The security considerations for using RADIUS\n      in bootstrapping\
    \ Mobile IPv4 are described in a later section of\n      this document.\n   o\
    \  Enhancing RADIUS transport reliability: The transport properties\n      of\
    \ RADIUS remain intact.  No new reliability mechanisms are\n      defined in the\
    \ transport of such Access Requests.\n   o  Extending RADIUS message set: RADIUS\
    \ extensions for bootstrapping\n      Mobile IPv4 are not to define new RADIUS\
    \ messages.  The Diameter\n      Mobile IP application [RFC4004] has defined new\
    \ command codes to\n      support Mobile IP signaling, depending on whether Diameter\
    \ server\n      is dealing with a Mobile IP HA or an FA.  RADIUS currently does\n\
    \      not have any messages that correspond to these Diameter commands.\n   \
    \   Instead, RADIUS extensions for Mobile IPv4 bootstrapping need to\n      provide\
    \ proposals for new RADIUS attributes that facilitate\n      Diameter-RADIUS messaging\
    \ translation without defining any new\n      RADIUS messaging.  At the same time,\
    \ the RADIUS extensions for\n      Mobile IPv4 need to re-use Diameter AVPs to\
    \ the fullest extent\n      possible.\n   o  RFC 2977 compatibility: Extending\
    \ RADIUS in a way that fulfills\n      the full list of requirements in [RFC2977]\
    \ will not be attempted.\n"
- title: 4.  Attributes
  contents:
  - "4.  Attributes\n   A specification of the RADIUS extensions for Mobile IPv4 needs\
    \ to\n   describe the full set of attributes required for RADIUS-Mobile IP\n \
    \  interaction.  While some of the attributes may already be\n   standardized,\
    \ others will require standardization and IANA type\n   assignments.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   This requirement document does not allocate any numbers,\
    \ so there are\n   no IANA considerations.  On the other hand, future solution\
    \ documents\n   for RADIUS support of Mobile IPv4 will likely introduce new RADIUS\n\
    \   attributes.  Thus, those documents will need new attribute type\n   numbers\
    \ assigned by IANA.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Enhancing security properties of RADIUS are a\
    \ specific non-goal for\n   the RADIUS extensions providing support for Mobile\
    \ IP.  Also, as this\n   is a requirements document and not a solution specification\
    \ document,\n   no new security considerations are noted, aside from those that\n\
    \   already exist for RADIUS.  As such, the existing RADIUS security\n   considerations\
    \ described previously apply, and no additional security\n   considerations are\
    \ added here.  For instance, the assumption in\n   RADIUS is that intermediary\
    \ nodes are trusted, while at the same time\n   there is a concern on using AAA\
    \ protocols that use hop-by-hop\n   security to distribute keys.  Use of hop-by-hop\
    \ security for key\n   distribution can be in conflict with some of the requirements\
    \ stated\n   in [RFC4962], such as the requirement on binding a key to its context\n\
    \   and the requirement on limitation of the key scope.  The former for\n   instance\
    \ states that a key MUST be bound to the parties that are\n   expected to have\
    \ access to the keying material, while the latter\n   implies that parties that\
    \ do not require access to a key to perform\n   their role MUST not have access\
    \ to the key.  Both of these\n   requirements rule against trusting intermediary\
    \ nodes and proxies\n   with distribution of keys.  Due to lack of end-to-end\
    \ security\n   mechanisms for RADIUS, imposing a MUST requirement for not trusting\n\
    \   proxies is not possible.  The RADIUS Extension working group is in\n   the\
    \ process of specifying procedures for wrapping key materials\n   within RADIUS\
    \ attributes.  For the time being, support of Mobile IP\n   within RADIUS may\
    \ need to be based on trust of intermediaries,\n   despite the security considerations\
    \ described.\n   When it comes to protecting attributes in the Access Request,\n\
    \   [RFC2868], Section 3.5 provides a mechanism for encrypting RADIUS\n   attributes,\
    \ such as passwords.  There is also work under progress for\n   specifying wrapping\
    \ of sensitive attributes, such as key material\n   within RADIUS Access Accept\
    \ messages.  This work is currently\n   considered part of RADIUS crypto-agility\
    \ extensions and when\n   completed can be used in the process of distributing\
    \ sensitive\n   attributes, such as keying material from RADIUS servers.\n   It\
    \ is also possible to protect RADIUS transactions using IPsec (e.g.,\n   as in\
    \ RFC3579).\n"
