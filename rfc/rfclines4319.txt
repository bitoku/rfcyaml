Abstract This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes objects used for managing
High Bit Rate Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) 2nd generation (HDSL2) and Single Pair High Speed Digital Subscriber Line (SHDSL) interfaces.
This document introduces extensions to several objects and textual conventions defined in HDSL2 SHDSL Line MIB (RFC 3276).
This document obsoletes RFC 3276.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in the Internet community for the purpose of managing HDSL2/SHDSL lines.
The MIB module described in RFC 3276
[RFC3276] describes objects used for managing High Bit Rate DSL 2nd generation (HDSL2)
[T1E1.4] and Single Pair High Speed Digital Subscriber Line (SHDSL) interfaces [G.991.2].
These object descriptions are based upon the specifications for the HDSL2 and SHDSL Embedded Operations Channel (EOC), as defined in the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
[T1E1.4] and International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
This document obsoletes RFC 3276 [RFC3276], which supports G.shdsl in that the MIB module described
herein supports G.shdsl.bis as described in the G.991.2 [G.991.2].
In addition, objects have been added to improve the management of SHDSL lines.
The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2 transmission, as discussed in the MIB 2 Integration (RFC 2863 [RFC2863]) section of this document.
This section outlines the relationship of this MIB module with other MIB modules described in RFCs.
Specifically, the IF MIB, as presented in RFC 2863 [RFC2863], is discussed.
General IF MIB Integration (RFC 2863)
The HDSL2/SHDSL line MIB specifies the detailed attributes of a data interface.
As such, it needs to integrate with RFC 2863 [RFC2863].
The IANA has assigned the following ifTypes to HDSL2 and SHDSL:
[RFC2863] MUST be supported and that the ifRcvAddressGroup does not apply to this MIB module.
The MIB branch identified by this ifType contains tables appropriate for this interface type.
Most such tables extend the ifEntry table and are indexed by ifIndex.
For interfaces in systems implementing this MIB module, those table entries indexed by ifIndex MUST be persistent.
The following attributes are part of the mandatory ifGeneralInformationGroup in RFC 2863
[RFC2863] and are not duplicated in the HDSL2/SHDSL line MIB.
(This is fixed at 1552000 for HDSL2 lines)
This object MUST have an octet string with zero length.
(For HDSL2 lines, this is fixed at 2)
Use of ifTable Objects 2.2.
The HDSL2 SHDSL LINE MIB module requires the allocation of a single object identifier for its MODULE IDENTITY.
The IANA has allocated this object identifier in the transmission subtree (48), defined in the SNMPv2 SMI MIB module.
The assignment was in fact done when RFC 3276 was published, and this revision of the RFC does not require any new action from IANA.

It contains the following table:
hdsl2ShdslEndpointCurrTable  Segment Endpoint 15 Minute Interval Status/Performance Group:

SHDSL Wire Pair Group: This group supports MIB objects that provide status of the SHDSL  specific wire pairs.
hdsl2ShdslEndpointCurrActivationState  Payload Group: This group supports MIB objects for retrieving payload rates that exclude any framing overhead.
An HDSL2/SHDSL line consists of a minimum of two units:
xtuC (the central termination unit) and an xtuR (the remote termination unit).
The line may optionally support up to 8 repeater/regenerator units (xru) as shown in the figure below.
Figure 2: General Topology for an HDSL2/SHDSL Line 2.6.
Counters, Interval Buckets, and Thresholds For SNR Margin, Loop Attenuation, ES, SES, CRC anomalies, LOSW, and UAS, there are event counters, current 15 minute and 0 to 96 15  minute history bucket(s) of "interval counters", as well as current and 0 to 30 previous 1 day interval counter(s).
Each current 15  minute event bucket has an associated threshold notification.
, there is no representation in the MIB module for invalid buckets.
In those cases where the data for an interval is suspect or known to be invalid, the agent MUST NOT report the interval.
If the current 15 minute event bucket is determined to be invalid, notifications based upon the value of the event bucket MUST NOT be generated.
Not reporting an interval will result in holes in the associated table.
For example, the table hdsl2Shdsl15MinIntervalTable is indexed by { ifIndex, hdsl2ShdslInvIndex, hdsl2ShdslEndpointSide, hdsl2ShdslEndpointWirePair, hdsl2Shdsl15MinIntervalNumber}.
If interval 12 is determined to be invalid but intervals 11 and 13 are valid, a Get Next operation on the indices .1.1.1.1.11 would return indices .1.1.1.1.13.
There is no requirement for an agent to ensure a fixed relationship between the start of a 15 minute interval and any wall clock; however, some implementations may align the 15 minute intervals with quarter hours.
Likewise, an implementation may choose to align 1 day intervals with the start of a day.
Counters are not reset when an xU is reinitialized, only when the agent is reset or reinitialized (or under specific request outside the scope of this MIB module).
As a managed node can handle a large number of xUs (e.g., hundreds or perhaps thousands of lines), provisioning every parameter on every xU may become burdensome.
Moreover, most lines are provisioned identically with the same set of parameters.
To simplify the provisioning process, this MIB module makes use of profiles.
A profile is a set of parameters that can be shared by multiple lines using the same configuration.
The following profiles are used in this MIB module:
Span Configuration Profiles Span configuration profiles contain parameters for configuring HDSL2/SHDSL spans.
They are defined in the hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfileTable.
Since span configuration parameters are only applicable for SHDSL, the support for span configuration profiles is optional for HDSL2 interfaces.
Note that the configuration of the span dictates the behavior for each individual segment endpoint in the span.
If a different configuration is provisioned for any given segment endpoint within the span, the new configuration for this segment endpoint will override the span configuration for this segment endpoint only.
Segment Endpoint Alarm Configuration Profiles
These profiles contain parameters for configuring alarm thresholds for HDSL2/ SHDSL segment endpoints.
These profiles are defined in the hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfileTable.
The index value for this profile is a locally unique administratively assigned name for the profile having the textual convention 'SnmpAdminString' (RFC 3411 [RFC3411]).
One or more lines may be configured to share parameters of a single profile (e.g., hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfile   'silver') by setting its hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfile objects to the value of this profile.
If a change is made to the profile, all lines that refer to it will be reconfigured to the changed parameters.
Before a profile can be deleted or taken out of service, it must be first unreferenced from all associated lines.
Implementations MUST provide a default profile whose name is 'DEFVAL' for each profile type.
The values of the associated parameters will be vendor specific unless otherwise indicated in this document.
Before a line's profiles have been set, these profiles will be automatically used by setting hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfile and hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfile to 'DEFVAL' where appropriate.
This default profile name, 'DEFVAL', is considered reserved in the context of profiles defined in this MIB module.
Profiles are created, assigned, and deleted dynamically using the profile name and profile row status in each of the four profile tables.
Profile changes MUST take effect immediately.
These changes MAY result in a restart (hard reset or soft restart) of the units on the line.
The ability to generate the SNMP notifications coldStart/warmStart (per [RFC3418]), which are per agent (e.g., per Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer, or DSLAM, in such a device), and linkUp/ linkDown (per [RFC2863]), which are per interface (i.e., HDSL2/SHDSL line) is required.
A linkDown notification MAY be generated whenever any ES, SES, CRC anomaly, LOSW, or UAS event occurs.
The corresponding linkUp notification MAY be sent when all link failure conditions are cleared.
The notifications defined in this MIB module are for initialization failure and for the threshold crossings associated with the following events: ES, SES, CRC anomaly, LOSW, and UAS.
Each threshold has its own enable/threshold value.
When that value is 0, the notification is disabled.
The hdsl2ShdslEndpointCurrStatus is a bitmask representing all outstanding error conditions associated with a particular segment endpoint.
that since the status of remote endpoints is obtained via the EOC, this information may be unavailable for units that are unreachable via EOC during a line error condition.
Therefore, not all conditions may always be included in its current status.
Notifications corresponding to the bit fields in this object are defined.
Two alarm conditions, SNR Margin Alarm and Loop Attenuation Alarm, are organized in a manner slightly different from that implied in the EOC specifications.
In the MIB module, these alarm conditions are tied to the two thresholds, hdsl2ShdslEndpointThreshSNRMargin and hdsl2ShdslEndpointThreshLoopAttenuation, found in the hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfileTable.
In the EOC, the alarm conditions associated with these thresholds are per unit.
In the MIB module, these alarm conditions are per endpoint.
For terminal units, this has no impact.
For repeaters, this implies an implementation variance where the agent in the terminal unit is responsible for detecting a threshold crossing.
As the reporting of a repeater detected alarm condition to the polling terminal unit occurs in the same EOC message as the reporting of the current SNR Margin and Loop Attenuation values, it is anticipated that this will have very little impact on agent implementation.
A threshold notification occurs whenever the corresponding current 15 minute interval error counter becomes equal to, or exceeds, the threshold value.
Only one notification SHOULD be sent per interval per interface.
Since the current 15 minute counter is reset to 0 every 15 minutes, and if the condition persists, the notification may recur as often as every 15 minutes.
For example, to get a notification whenever a "loss of" event occurs (but at most once every 15 minutes), set the corresponding threshold to 1.
The agent will generate a notification when the event originally occurs.
Notifications, other than the threshold notifications listed above, SHOULD be rate limited (throttled)
such that there is at least a 1 minute gap between the generation of consecutive notifications of the same event.
When notifications are rate limited, they are dropped and not queued for sending at a future time.
This is intended to be a general rate limiting statement for notifications that have no explicit rate limiting assertions in this document otherwise.
Note that the Network Management System, or NMS, may receive a linkDown notification as well, if enabled (via ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable [RFC2863]).
At the beginning of the next 15 minute interval, the counter is reset.
When the first second goes by and the event occurs, the current interval bucket will be 1, which equals the threshold, and the notification will be sent again.
An hdsl2ShdslSpanInvalidNumRepeaters notification may be generated following completion of the discovery phase if the number of repeaters discovered on the line differs from the number of repeaters specified in hdsl2ShdslSpanConfNumRepeaters.
For those conditions where the number of provisioned repeaters is greater than those encountered during span discovery, all table entries associated with the nonexistent repeaters are to be discarded.
For those conditions where the number of provisioned repeaters is less than those encountered during span discovery, additional table entries are to be created using the default span configuration profile.

1 919 850 6194" DESCRIPTION "
This MIB module defines a collection of objects for managing HDSL2/SHDSL lines.
An agent may reside at either end of the line; however, the MIB module is designed to require no management communication between the modems beyond that inherent in the low level EOC line protocol as defined in ANSI
(for HDSL2 lines) or in ITU G.991.2 (for SHDSL lines).
This version of this MIB module is part of RFC 4319; see the RFC itself for full legal notices."
This version, published as RFC 4319.
The following changes have been made in this version: 1.
Added a 3rd and 4th wire pair.
2.  Modified all rates such that their rates are only constrained by an unsigned 32 bit value and not by what today's perceived technology limitations are.
Clarified that the rates from RFC 3276 include payload and any applicable framing and added objects for payload only rates.
Added an object to indicate whether the tip and ring are reversed on a wire pair.
Added an object to display the activation state of a wire pair.
Added references as necessary for clarification.
Added display hints to textual conventions as necessary.
Updated conformance statements as necessary.
Some changes were due to IETF requirements and RFC generation tools."
May 9, 2002 DESCRIPTION "
"A gauge associated with interface performance measurements in a current 1 day (24 hour) measurement interval.
The value of this gauge starts at zero at the beginning of an interval and is increased when associated events occur, until the end of the 1 day interval.
At that time, the value of the gauge is stored in the previous 1 day history interval, as defined in a companion object of type Hdsl2Shdsl1DayIntevalCount, and the current interval gauge is restarted at zero.
In the case where the agent has no valid data available for this interval, the corresponding object instance is not available, and upon a retrieval request, a corresponding error message shall be returned to indicate that this instance does not exist.
Please note that zero is a valid value."
TEXTUAL CONVENTION DISPLAY HINT "d
" STATUS    current DESCRIPTION "
A counter associated with interface performance measurements during the most previous 1 day (24 hour) measurement interval.
The value of this gauge is equal to the value of the current day gauge, as defined in a companion object of type Hdsl2ShdslPerfCurrDayCount, at the end of its most recent interval.
In the case where the agent has no valid data available for this interval, the corresponding object instance is not available, and upon a retrieval request, a corresponding error message shall be returned to indicate that this instance does not exist."

A management application that supports RFC 3276 could mistakenly flag a unit that responds with a rate or wire pair that exceeds the ranges and/or enumerations specified in RFC 3276.
For example, a G.shdsl.bis line with four wire pairs would report statistics for wire pairs that do not exist in RFC 3276.
That is, a GET NEXT request issues with the object identifier
: hdsl2ShdslEndpointCurrAtn.1.1.1.2 might return hdsl2ShdslEndpointCurrAtn.1.1.1.3   0 with a G.shdsl.bis unit and hdsl2ShdslEndpointCurrSnrMgn.1.1.1.1   0 with an HDSL2 unit as these objects are indexed by INDEX  { ifIndex, hdsl2ShdslInvIndex, hdsl2ShdslendpointSide, hdsl2ShdslEndpointWirePair }
A management application intended to manage G.shdsl.bis agents SHOULD be modified to accept this sequence.
One should note that this same unmodified management application is still capable of managing G.shdsl.bis agents albeit to the degree of G.SHDSL (non bis) limitations.
That is, it can create and monitor configurations limited to two wire pairs with an upper rate limit of 4112000 bits/second.
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:  hdsl2ShdslSpanConfTable
hdsl2ShdslSpanConfAlarmProfile Unauthorized changes to hdsl2ShdslSpanConfNumRepeaters could result in an hdsl2ShdslSpanInvalidNumRepeaters notification.
Note the discussion on hdsl2ShdslSpanInvalidNumRepeaters in the Notifications section above.
Unauthorized changes to hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfile could have an adverse operational effect on a span.
Reference the hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfileTable discussion below.
Unauthorized changes to hdsl2ShdslSpanConfAlarmProfile could have a contrary effect on notifications.
Reference the hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfileTable discussion below.
This table contains one object, hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfile, that supports SET operations.
Unauthorized changes could have an undesirable notifications.
Reference the hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfileTable discussion below.
The table consists of the following objects that support SET operations:
hdsl2ShdslMaintSoftRestart Unauthorized changes to hdsl2ShdslMaintLoopbackConfig could prevent end to end data transfer due to an activation of a loopback.
Unauthorized changes to hdsl2ShdslMaintPowerBackoff could result in an increased in bundle interference.
Unauthorized changes to hdsl2ShdslMaintSoftRestart could result in a temporary interruption of end to end data transfer as the result of the triggering of a soft restart.
This table contains one object, hdsl2ShdslMaintLoopbackTimeout, that supports SET operations.
An unauthorized change to this object could result in the timeout value for loopbacks being increased, decreased, or disabled.
The table consists of the following objects that support SET operations:
hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfileRowStatus Setting any of the objects to an incorrect value could have an adverse operational effect on a span.
Unauthorized changes to the hdsl2ShdslSpanConfWireInterface could result in the failure of a span to achieve activation to a state that would permit data flow.
For example, setting this object to six wire or eight wire operation when one of the units in the span only supports two wire or four wire operation would likely prevent an expected end to end data transfer capability.
Unauthorized changes to hdsl2ShdslSpanConfMinLineRate or
hdsl2ShdslSpanConfMaxLineRate could have an adverse effect on performance.
The range of allowable line rates could be altered such that the span may not be able to train to a line rate that would permit any end user data to traverse the span or the span could train to a line rate that is either greater than or less than the line rate that the provider has pledged.
Unauthorized changes to hdsl2ShdslSpanConfPSD or hdsl2ShdslSpanConfTransmissionMode could have a detrimental effect on loop reach, performance, or spectral compatibility.
Unauthorized changes to hdsl2ShdslSpanConfRemoteEnable could alter the remote management ability of units.
Unauthorized changes to hdsl2ShdslSpanConfPowerFeeding could shutdown units that are expected to be fed power remotely.
Changing the configuration such that wetting current is not supplied may result in corrosion of electrical contacts.
Unauthorized changes to hdsl2ShdslSpanConfCurrCondTargetMarginDown, hdsl2ShdslSpanConfWorstCaseTargetMarginDown, hdsl2ShdslSpanConfCurrCondTargetMarginUp, hdsl2ShdslSpanConfWorstCaseTargetMarginUp, or
hdsl2ShdslSpanConfUsedTargetMargins could result in invalid parameters used to determine if a data rate can be supported under current and worst case noise.
Unauthorized changes to hdsl2ShdslSpanConfReferenceClock could result in the selection of a clock source that might either prevent any data from being transferred or impair data transfer.
In addition, an increase in CRC anomalies may be experienced.
Unauthorized changes to hdsl2ShdslSpanConfLineProbeEnable could have a negative effect on selecting the optimum rate or power level based on current line conditions.
Unauthorized changes to row status could result in unwanted profiles being created or brought into service.
Also, changes to the row status could result in profiles being inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.
Increasing any of the threshold values could result in a notification being suppressed or deferred.
Setting a threshold to 0 could result in a notification being suppressed.
Suppressing or deferring a notification could prevent the timely delivery of important diagnostic information.
Decreasing any of the threshold values could result in a notification being sent from the network falsely reporting a threshold crossing.
Changing a threshold value could also have an impact on the amount of notifications the agent sends.
This document adds a paragraph, which was not in RFC 3276
[RFC3276], to the Notifications section that provides general guidance to the rate limiting of notifications.
Agent implementations not adhering to the rate
limiting desires could result in notifications being generated at an uncontrolled rate.
Unauthorized changes to a threshold value could result in an undesired notification rate.
Unauthorized changes to row status could result in unwanted profiles being created or brought into service.
Also, changes to the row status could result in profiles being inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
hdsl2ShdslInventoryTable Access to these objects would allow an intruder to obtain information about which vendor's equipment is in use on the network.
Further, such information is considered sensitive in many environments for competitive reasons.
hdsl2ShdslInvTransmissionModeCapability SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], Section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
