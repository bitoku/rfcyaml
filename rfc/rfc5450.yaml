  - "1.  Introduction\n   In the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) specification\
    \ [RFC3550],\n   network jitter calculations are based on the presumption that\
    \ packets\n   are transmitted essentially in accordance with their RTP timestamps.\n\
    \   This must be true, of course, on average over longer time intervals,\n   as\
    \ the client is playing the packets out according to those\n   timestamps.  However,\
    \ for individual packets, this may not be true\n   under some circumstances, such\
    \ as:\n   o  When the data rate of the stream is bursty, such as with video\n\
    \      where I-frames may be significantly larger than P or B frames,\n      traffic\
    \ smoothing may need to be applied to maintain an\n      appropriate data rate.\n\
    \   o  In video that has forward-decode dependencies, frames may need to\n   \
    \   be transmitted in decoding order (the sequence number order) but\n      with,\
    \ of course, presentation timestamps.  Under these\n      circumstances, the transmission\
    \ time of a frame sent early in\n      sequence does not correspond to its RTP\
    \ timestamp.\n   o  When retransmissions are sent, the retransmitted packet clearly\n\
    \      has a different actual transmission time from the original, even\n    \
    \  though they share the same timestamp.\n   Under some circumstances, it can\
    \ help the receiver, or intermediate\n   network elements, to know the actual\
    \ transmission time of the packet.\n   This RTP header extension element allows\
    \ the communication of this\n   information.\n   The RTP specification does not\
    \ define a transmission timestamp; nor\n   does this specification.  This specification\
    \ merely provides\n   information on the relationship between the relative transmission\n\
    \   times and relative RTP timestamps.\n   This specification allows the transmitter\
    \ to indicate to the receiver\n   any known variation between the spacing of transmission\
    \ times and the\n   spacing of RTP timestamps; any unreported variation introduced\
    \ at or\n   after the point of measurement of the transmission time will be\n\
    \   treated as network jitter by the receiver.  The definition of the\n   point\
    \ where the transmission time is measured or defined is left to\n   the transmitter,\
    \ though it should, of course, be consistent from\n   packet to packet.\n   This\
    \ information can also be of use to report the inter-arrival\n   jitter caused\
    \ by the network, excluding that introduced by the\n   source.  A new RTP Control\
    \ Protocol (RTCP) packet is defined to\n   enable this reporting.\n"

- title: 3.  Transmission Offset
  contents:
  - "3.  Transmission Offset\n   Classically, a pair of RTP packets with timestamps\
    \ S2 and S1 are\n   transmitted with a time interval between them of (S2 - S1).\
    \  This\n   specification permits sending an offset value O in each packet, O1\n\
    \   and O2.  One characteristic of these offsets is that the original\n   transmission\
    \ interval can be deduced to be (S2 + O2) - (S1 + O1).\n   More precisely, the\
    \ offset is defined as follows (with the function\n   RtoN converting from RTP\
    \ to Network Time Protocol (NTP) times, and\n   NtoR doing the reverse):\n   o\
    \  Take an RTP stream that has a recent RTCP sender report relating\n      RTP\
    \ timestamp S0 to NTP timestamp N0;\n   o  Consider a packet sent after that with\
    \ RTP timestamp S1.\n      Nominally, this is sent at N1 = (N0 + RtoN(S1 - S0));\n\
    \   o  If it was actually sent at a different time, Na, then the offset\n    \
    \  value O1 is O1 = NtoR(Na - N1).\n   The transmission time is signaled to the\
    \ receiver in-band using the\n   general mechanism for RTP header extensions [RFC5285].\
    \  The payload\n   of this extension (the transmitted value) is a 24-bit signed\
    \ integer.\n   When added to the RTP timestamp of the packet, it represents the\n\
    \   \"effective\" RTP transmission time of the packet, on the RTP\n   timescale.\
    \  The reported transmission time T1 of a packet with\n   timestamp S1 and an\
    \ offset of O1, from the above equations, is T1 =\n   S1+O1 (though of course\
    \ the transmission time values only have\n   meaning when two or more are compared).\n\
    \   The form of the transmission offset extension block is as follows:\n     \
    \  0                   1                   2                   3\n       0 1 2\
    \ 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \      |  ID   | len=2 |              transmission offset              |\n   \
    \   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n   The\
    \ length field takes the value 2 to indicate that 3 bytes follow.\n   The sign\
    \ of the offset value depends greatly on the choice of the\n   initial mapping\
    \ of RTP to NTP times.  In general, without scanning a\n   stream entirely it\
    \ is not possible to ensure that this mapping would\n   keep all the offsets positive;\
    \ therefore, this specification allows\n   negative values.\n   Imagine a stream\
    \ with the following timestamps and sizes (in KB):\n   200    2 KB\n   300   \
    \ 4 KB\n   400    2 KB\n   500   12 KB\n   600   ...effective end of stream\n\
    \   This has 20 KB spread over 400 time units, i.e., on average, 1 KB per\n  \
    \ 20 time units.  We traffic-smooth this, and establish that given a\n   transmission\
    \ time of x for the first packet, we would transmit the\n   following packets\
    \ at the given intervals later:\n   x + 000   2 KB\n   x + 040   4 KB\n   x +\
    \ 120   2 KB\n   x + 160  12 KB\n   x + 400 ...effective end of stream\n   The\
    \ choice of x is essentially arbitrary: only relative values of\n   timestamps\
    \ matter.  Now, let's say I claim on the first packet that\n   it went out *at*\
    \ its RTP timestamp, i.e., with an offset of 0,\n   meaning that x is 200.  Then\
    \ the offset values are:\n      0\n    -60\n    -80\n   -140\n   This is because\
    \ in this case, I traffic-smooth by conceptually\n   sending the small packets\
    \ 'early'.  But since only the relative\n   values are significant, it is just\
    \ as valid to say x is 400,\n   whereupon the offset values are:\n   200\n   140\n\
    \   120\n    60\n   In a stream where this extension is not in effect (i.e., not\
    \ declared\n   or negotiated), the actual transmission offset is therefore unknown.\n\
    \   However, when the extension is in effect for the stream, it MAY be\n   omitted\
    \ in those packets for which the offset is 0 (zero); that is,\n   packets sent\
    \ at their nominal time do not need this to be tagged with\n   this extension.\
    \  Therefore, the implied transmission time of an un-\n   tagged RTP packet depends\
    \ on whether the extension is in effect for\n   the stream (and therefore the\
    \ transmission offset is 0) or not\n   (whereupon the transmission offset is unknown).\n\
    \   The jitter calculations performed by an RTP client MUST NOT use these\n  \
    \ transmission offsets.  In general, the sender (or intermediate\n   network elements\
    \ doing RTP analysis) cannot always know whether the\n   offsets have been taken\
    \ into account or not.  Therefore, for\n   consistency, the jitter calculation\
    \ should continue to operate on the\n   'raw' reception times.  However, see Section\
    \ 4 on extended jitter\n   reports, below.\n   There are no extensionattributes\
    \ defined for this extension.\n   It is structurally possible to have more than\
    \ one extension of the\n   same type in a packet.  However, this extension is\
    \ only defined for\n   the source to report.  Intermediate network nodes that\
    \ are not the\n   source of the RTP session MUST NOT add this extension (whether\
    \ or not\n   it was previously present) and MUST NOT alter the existing\n   transmission\
    \ offset value in a packet, if the extension is already\n   present.\n   (Of course,\
    \ it is clear that network elements that terminate an RTP\n   flow, and are the\
    \ source for a new RTP flow, can add a transmission\n   offset extension header\
    \ to the RTP packets of the new flow, if\n   desired.)\n"
