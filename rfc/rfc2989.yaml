  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document represents a summary of AAA protocol requirements\
    \ for\n   network access.  In creating this documents, inputs were taken from\n\
    \   documents produced by the NASREQ [3], ROAMOPS [2], and MOBILEIP [5]\n   working\
    \ groups, as well as from TIA 45.6 [4].  This document\n   summarizes the requirements\
    \ collected from those sources, separating\n   requirements for authentication,\

- title: 1.1.  Requirements language
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements language\n   In this document, the key words \"MAY\", \"MUST,\
    \ \"MUST NOT\", \"optional\",\n   \"recommended\", \"SHOULD\", and \"SHOULD NOT\"\
    , are to be interpreted as\n   described in [1].\n   Please note that the requirements\
    \ specified in this document are to\n   be used in evaluating AAA protocol submissions.\
    \  As such, the\n   requirements language refers to capabilities of these protocols;\
    \ the\n   protocol documents will specify whether these features are required,\n\
    \   recommended, or optional.  For example, requiring that a protocol\n   support\
    \ confidentiality is NOT the same thing as requiring that all\n   protocol traffic\
    \ be encrypted.\n   A protocol submission is not compliant if it fails to satisfy\
    \ one or\n   more of the MUST or MUST NOT requirements for the capabilities that\n\
    \   it implements.  A protocol submission that satisfies all the MUST,\n   MUST\
    \ NOT, SHOULD and SHOULD NOT requirements for its capabilities is\n   said to\
    \ be \"unconditionally compliant\"; one that satisfies all the\n   MUST and MUST\
    \ NOT requirements but not all the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT\n   requirements for its\
    \ protocols is said to be \"conditionally\n   compliant.\"\n"
- title: 1.2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Terminology\n   Accounting\n             The act of collecting information\
    \ on resource usage for the\n             purpose of trend analysis, auditing,\
    \ billing, or cost\n             allocation.\n   Administrative Domain\n     \
    \        An internet, or a collection of networks, computers, and\n          \
    \   databases under a common administration.  Computer entities\n            \
    \ operating in a common administration may be assumed to\n             share administratively\
    \ created security associations.\n   Attendant A node designed to provide the\
    \ service interface between a\n             client and the local domain.\n   Authentication\n\
    \             The act of verifying a claimed identity, in the form of a\n    \
    \         pre-existing label from a mutually known name space, as the\n      \
    \       originator of a message (message authentication) or as the\n         \
    \    end-point of a channel (entity authentication).\n   Authorization\n     \
    \        The act of determining if a particular right, such as\n             access\
    \ to some resource, can be granted to the presenter of\n             a particular\
    \ credential.\n   Billing   The act of preparing an invoice.\n   Broker    A Broker\
    \ is an entity that is in a different administrative\n             domain from\
    \ both the home AAA server and the local ISP, and\n             which provides\
    \ services, such as facilitating payments\n             between the local ISP\
    \ and home administrative entities.\n             There are two different types\
    \ of brokers; proxy and\n             routing.\n   Client    A node wishing to\
    \ obtain service from an attendant within\n             an administrative domain.\n\
    \   End-to-End\n             End-to-End is the security model that requires that\n\
    \             security information be able to traverse, and be validated\n   \
    \          even when an AAA message is processed by intermediate nodes\n     \
    \        such as proxies, brokers, etc.\n   Foreign Domain\n             An administrative\
    \ domain, visited by a Mobile IP client,\n             and containing the AAA\
    \ infrastructure needed to carry out\n             the necessary operations enabling\
    \ Mobile IP registrations.\n             From the point of view of the foreign\
    \ agent, the foreign\n             domain is the local domain.\n   Home Domain\n\
    \             An administrative domain, containing the network whose\n       \
    \      prefix matches that of a mobile node's home address, and\n            \
    \ containing the AAA infrastructure needed to carry out the\n             necessary\
    \ operations enabling Mobile IP registrations.\n             From the point of\
    \ view of the home agent, the home domain\n             is the local domain.\n\
    \   Hop-by-hop\n             Hop-by-hop is the security model that requires that\
    \ each\n             direct set of peers in a proxy network share a security\n\
    \             association, and the security information does not traverse\n  \
    \           a AAA entity.\n   Inter-domain Accounting\n             Inter-domain\
    \ accounting is the collection of information on\n             resource usage\
    \ of an entity within an administrative\n             domain, for use within another\
    \ administrative domain.  In\n             inter-domain accounting, accounting\
    \ packets and session\n             records will typically cross administrative\
    \ boundaries.\n   Intra-domain Accounting\n             Intra-domain accounting\
    \ is the collection of information on\n             resource within an administrative\
    \ domain, for use within\n             that domain.  In intra-domain accounting,\
    \ accounting\n             packets and session records typically do not cross\n\
    \             administrative boundaries.\n   Local Domain\n             An administrative\
    \ domain containing the AAA infrastructure\n             of immediate interest\
    \ to a Mobile IP client when it is away\n             from home.\n   Proxy   \
    \  A AAA proxy is an entity that acts as both a client and a\n             server.\
    \  When a request is received from a client, the\n             proxy acts as a\
    \ AAA server.  When the same request needs to\n             be forwarded to another\
    \ AAA entity, the proxy acts as a AAA\n             client.\n   Local Proxy\n\
    \             A Local Proxy is a AAA server that satisfies the definition\n  \
    \           of a Proxy, and exists within the same administrative\n          \
    \   domain as the network device (e.g., NAS) that issued the\n             AAA\
    \ request.  Typically, a local proxy will enforce local\n             policies\
    \ prior to forwarding responses to the network\n             devices, and are\
    \ generally used to multiplex AAA messages\n             from a large number of\
    \ network devices.\n   Network Access Identifier\n             The Network Access\
    \ Identifier (NAI) is the userID submitted\n             by the client during\
    \ network access authentication.  In\n             roaming, the purpose of the\
    \ NAI is to identify the user as\n             well as to assist in the routing\
    \ of the authentication\n             request.  The NAI may not necessarily be\
    \ the same as the\n             user's e-mail address or the user-ID submitted\
    \ in an\n             application layer authentication.\n   Routing Broker\n \
    \            A Routing Broker is a AAA entity that satisfies the\n           \
    \  definition of a Broker, but is NOT in the transmission path\n             of\
    \ AAA messages between the local ISP and the home domain's\n             AAA servers.\
    \  When a request is received by a Routing\n             Broker, information is\
    \ returned to the AAA requester that\n             includes the information necessary\
    \ for it to be able to\n             contact the Home AAA server directly.  Certain\n\
    \             organizations providing Routing Broker services MAY also\n     \
    \        act as a Certificate Authority, allowing the Routing Broker\n       \
    \      to return the certificates necessary for the local ISP and\n          \
    \   the home AAA servers to communicate securely.\n   Non-Proxy Broker\n     \
    \        A Routing Broker is occasionally referred to as a Non-Proxy\n       \
    \      Broker.\n   Proxy Broker\n             A Proxy Broker is a AAA entity that\
    \ satisfies the\n             definition of a Broker, and acts as a Transparent\
    \ Proxy by\n             acting as the forwarding agent for all AAA messages between\n\
    \             the local ISP and the home domain's AAA servers.\n   Real-time Accounting\n\
    \             Real-time accounting involves the processing of information\n  \
    \           on resource usage within a defined time window.  Time\n          \
    \   constraints are typically imposed in order to limit\n             financial\
    \ risk.\n   Roaming Capability\n             Roaming capability can be loosely\
    \ defined as the ability to\n             use any one of multiple Internet service\
    \ providers (ISPs),\n             while maintaining a formal, customer-vendor\
    \ relationship\n             with only one.  Examples of cases where roaming capability\n\
    \             might be required include ISP \"confederations\" and ISP-\n    \
    \         provided corporate network access support.\n   Session record\n    \
    \         A session record represents a summary of the resource\n            \
    \ consumption of a user over the entire session.  Accounting\n             gateways\
    \ creating the session record may do so by\n             processing interim accounting\
    \ events.\n   Transparent Proxy\n             A Transparent Proxy is a AAA server\
    \ that satisfies the\n             definition of a Proxy, but does not enforce\
    \ any local\n             policies (meaning that it does not add, delete or modify\n\
    \             attributes or modify information within messages it\n          \
    \   forwards).\n"

    \ NOT\n   Clarifications\n   [a]  The AAA protocol must be capable of supporting\
    \ millions of users\n        and tens of thousands of simultaneous requests. \
    \ The AAA\n        architecture and protocol MUST be capable of supporting tens\
    \ of\n        thousands of devices, AAA servers, proxies and brokers.\n   [b]\
    \  In the event of failure to communicate with a given server, the\n        protocol\
    \ must provide a mechanism to change service to another\n        backup or secondary\
    \ server.\n   [c]  This requirement refers to the ability to support mutual\n\
    \        authentication between the AAA client and server.\n   [d]  The AAA protocol\
    \ requires authentication, integrity protection\n        and confidentiality at\
    \ the transmission layer.  This security\n        model is also referred to as\
    \ hop-by-hop security, whereas the\n        security is established between two\
    \ communicating peers.  All of\n        the security is removed when the AAA message\
    \ is processed by a\n        receiving AAA entity.\n   [e]  The AAA protocol requires\
    \ confidentiality at the object level,\n        where an object consists of one\
    \ or more attributes.  Object\n        level confidentiality implies that only\
    \ the target AAA entity\n        for whom the data is ultimately destined may\
    \ decrypt the data,\n        regardless of the fact that the message may traverse\
    \ one or more\n        intermediate AAA entities (e.g., proxies, brokers).\n \
    \  [f]  The AAA protocol requires authentication and integrity\n        protection\
    \ at the object level, which consists of one or more\n        attributes.  Object\
    \ level authentication must be persistent\n        across one or more intermediate\
    \ AAA entity (e.g., proxy, broker,\n        etc), meaning that any AAA entity\
    \ in a proxy chain may verify\n        the authentication.  This implies that\
    \ data that is covered by\n        object level security CANNOT be modified by\
    \ intermediate\n        servers.\n   [g]  The AAA protocol MUST be capable of\
    \ transporting certificates.\n        This requirement is intended as an optimization,\
    \ in lieu of\n        requiring that an out-of-band protocol be used to fetch\n\
    \        certificates.\n   [h]  This requirement refers to resilience against\
    \ packet loss,\n        including:\n        1. Hop-by-hop retransmission and fail-over\
    \ so that reliability\n           does not solely depend on single hop transport\n\
    \           retransmission.\n        2. Control of the retransmission mechanism\
    \ by the AAA\n           application.\n        3. Acknowledgment by the transport\
    \ that a message was delivered\n           successfully, separate from message\
    \ semantics or syntax\n           evaluation.\n        5. Piggy-backing of acknowledgments\
    \ in AAA messages.\n        6. Timely delivery of AAA responses.\n   [i]  In the\
    \ Mobile IP AAA architecture, brokers can be in the\n        forwarding path,\
    \ in which case they act as transparent proxies\n        (proxy brokers).  Alternatively,\
    \ it is also possible to conceive\n        of brokers operating as certifying\
    \ authorities outside of the\n        forwarding path (routing brokers).\n   [j]\
    \  An auditable process is one in which it is possible to\n        definitively\
    \ determine what actions have been performed on AAA\n        packets as they travel\
    \ from the home AAA server to the network\n        device and back.\n   [k]  The\
    \ AAA protocol MUST allow communication to be secured.\n        However, the AAA\
    \ protocol MUST also allow an underlying security\n        service (e.g., IP Security)\
    \ to be used.  When the latter is\n        used, the former MUST NOT be required.\n\
    \   [l]  The AAA protocol MUST be extensible by third parties (e.g.,\n       \
    \ other IETF Working Groups), in order to define attributes that\n        are\
    \ specific to the service being defined.  This requirement\n        simply means\
    \ that the AAA protocol MUST allow groups other than\n        the AAA WG to define\
    \ standard attributes.\n"

    \ NOT\n   Clarifications\n   [a]  The AAA protocol MUST allow the use of Network\
    \ Access\n        Identifiers (NAI) [8] to identify users and/or devices.\n  \
    \ [b]  The AAA protocol MUST allow CHAP [20] authentication information\n    \
    \    to be transported.  This is commonly used by Network Access\n        Servers\
    \ that request authentication of a PPP user.\n   [c]  The AAA protocol MUST allow\
    \ for Extensible Authentication\n        Protocol (EAP) [14] payload to be transported.\
    \  Since some EAP\n        authentication mechanisms require more than one round\
    \ trip, the\n        AAA protocol must allow for such authentication mechanisms\
    \ to be\n        used.  The actual EAP authentication mechanism negotiated MUST\n\
    \        be transparent to the AAA protocol.  When EAP is used,\n        authentication\
    \ typically occurs between the user being\n        authenticated and his/her home\
    \ AAA server.\n   [d]  While PAP is deprecated, it is still in widespread use\
    \ for its\n        original intended purpose, which is support of clear-text\n\
    \        passwords.  As a result, a AAA protocol will need to be able to\n   \
    \     securely transport clear-text passwords.  This includes\n        providing\
    \ for confidentiality of clear-text passwords traveling\n        over the wire,\
    \ as well as protecting against disclosure of\n        clear-text passwords to\
    \ proxies in the forwarding path.\n   [e]  The AAA protocol MUST allow for a user\
    \ to be re-authenticated\n        on-demand.  The protocol MUST allow for this\
    \ event to be\n        triggered by either the user, access device (AAA client),\
    \ or the\n        home or visited AAA server.\n   [f]  The AAA protocol MUST NOT\
    \ require that credentials of the user\n        be provided during authorization.\
    \  The AAA protocol supports\n        authorization by identification or assertion\
    \ only.\n"

    \ a static or\n        dynamic address during the authorization phase of a user\
    \ and/or\n        device.  The address assigned MUST be either of type IPv4 or\n\
    \        IPv6.  If both the client AND the server are aware of a pre-\n      \
    \  configured address, then it is considered static.  Anything else\n        is\
    \ dynamic.\n   [b]  This requirement refers to the ability of a new AAA protocol\
    \ be\n        sufficiently compatible with the large installed base of\n     \
    \   attributes for existing approaches (RADIUS), such that a server\n        implementation\
    \ could speak both protocols, or translate between\n        them.\n   [c]  This\
    \ requirement refers to the ability of a proxy broker to deny\n        access\
    \ without forwarding the access request to the AAA server,\n        or to deny\
    \ access after receiving an access accept from the AAA\n        server.\n   [d]\
    \  This requirement refers to the ability of the AAA client or\n        server\
    \ to trigger re-authorization, or to the ability of the\n        server to send\
    \ updated authorization information to the device,\n        such as \"stop service.\"\
    \  Authorization can allow for a time\n        period, then additional authorization\
    \ can be sought to continue.\n        A server can initially authorize a user\
    \ to connect and receive\n        services, but later decide the user is no longer\
    \ allowed use of\n        the service, for example after N minutes.  Authorizations\
    \ can\n        have a time limit.  Re-authorization does not necessarily imply\n\
    \        re-authentication.\n   [e]  This requirement refers to the ability to\
    \ of the protocol to\n        describe access operational limitations and authorization\n\
    \        restrictions to usage to the NAS which includes (but is not\n       \
    \ limited to):\n        1. Session expirations and Idle Timeouts\n        2. Packet\
    \ filters\n        3. Static routes\n        4. QoS parameters\n   [f]  This requirement\
    \ refers to the ability of the NAS to use the AAA\n        server to manage resource\
    \ allocation state.  This capability can\n        assist with, but it is not synonymous\
    \ with, simultaneous user\n        login control, port usage limitations, or IP\
    \ address pooling.\n        The design must provide for recovery from data loss\
    \ due to a\n        variety of faults, including NAS and AAA server reboots, and\n\
    \        NAS/AAA server communication outages, and MUST be independent of\n  \
    \      the accounting stream.  The granularity of the recovery of state\n    \
    \    information after an outage may be on the order of a fraction of\n      \
    \  a minute.  In order to provide for state recovery, explicit\n        session/resource\
    \ status and update and disconnect messages will\n        be required.\n     \
    \   Because of potential multi-domain issues, only systems that\n        allocate\
    \ or use a resource should track its state.\n   [g]  This requirement refers to\
    \ the ability of the AAA server to\n        request the NAS to disconnect an active\
    \ session for\n        authorization policy reasons.\n"

    \ NOT\n   Clarifications\n   [a]  This requirement may be loosely defined as reporting\n\
    \        synchronously with events.  Typically the time window is on the\n   \
    \     order of seconds, not milliseconds.\n   [b]  The AAA protocol's Accounting\
    \ data format MUST NOT be bloated,\n        imposing a large overhead for one\
    \ or more accounting data\n        elements.\n   [c]  This requirement refers\
    \ to the ability to buffer or store\n        multiple accounting records, and\
    \ send them together at some\n        later time.\n   [d]  This is an application\
    \ layer acknowledgment.  This is sent when\n        the receiving server is willing\
    \ to take responsibility for the\n        message data.\n   [e]  This requirement\
    \ refers to the ability to reflect the time of\n        occurrence of events such\
    \ as log-on, logoff, authentication,\n        authorization and interim accounting.\
    \  It also implies the\n        ability to provide for unambiguous time-stamps.\n\
    \   [f]  This requirement refers to the ability to account for dynamic\n     \
    \   authentication and authorization.  To support this, there can be\n       \
    \ multiple accounting records for a single session.\n"
