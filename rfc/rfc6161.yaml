- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the conventions for using Elliptic\
    \ Curve\n   cryptographic algorithms with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)\n\
    \   encrypted key package content type [RFC6032].  Specifically, it\n   includes\
    \ conventions necessary to implement the following CMS content\n   types: EnvelopedData\
    \ [RFC5652] and SignedData [RFC5652].  This\n   document amends [RFC6033].  Familiarity\
    \ with [RFC6033] and [RFC5753]\n   is assumed.\n   This document does not define\
    \ any new algorithms; instead, it refers\n   to previously defined algorithms.\n"
- title: 1.1  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in\n   [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  EnvelopedData
  contents:
  - "2.  EnvelopedData\n   When key agreement is used, standard (as opposed to cofactor)\
    \ ECDH\n   [RFC6090][RFC5753] MAY be supported.\n"
- title: 3.  SignedData
  contents:
  - "3.  SignedData\n   If an implementation encapsulates EncryptedKeyPackage with\
    \ SignedData\n   [RFC5652], then it MAY support the signature scheme ECDSA\n \
    \  [RFC6090][RFC5753].\n"
- title: 4.  Public Key Sizes
  contents:
  - "4.  Public Key Sizes\n   The easiest way to implement SignedData and EnvelopedData\
    \ is with\n   public key certificates [RFC5280][RFC5480].  If an implementation\n\
    \   supports ECDSA or ECDH, then it MUST support keys on the P-256 curve.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations from [RFC5280], [RFC5480],\
    \ [RFC5652],\n   [RFC5753], [RFC6033], and [RFC6090] apply.\n"
