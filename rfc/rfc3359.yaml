  - "Abstract\n   This document describes implementation codepoints within Intermediate\n\
    \   System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) used today by several ISPs for\n   routing\
    \ within their clouds.  IS-IS is an interior gateway routing\n   protocol developed\
    \ originally by OSI and used with IP extensions as\n   Interior Gateway Protocol\
    \ (IGP).  This document summarizes all Table,\n   Length and Value (TLV) codepoints\
    \ that are being used by the protocol\n   and its pending extensions.\n"

- title: 2. Assignment Procedures
  contents:
  - "2. Assignment Procedures\n   This document is provided to avoid possible future\
    \ conflicts in the\n   assignment of TLV numbers.  It does not constitute or represent\
    \ any\n   standard or authority assigning TLV numbers.  TLV assignment happens\n\
    \   on a shared, informational basis between the ISO, SIF and the IETF\n   working\
    \ groups.  The core ISIS protocol is being specified in the ISO\n   standards\
    \ body, IP extensions to it however are products of the ISIS\n   working group\
    \ in IETF.  Since ISO does not provide a numbering\n   authority and IANA is only\
    \ responsible for IP related coding points,\n   no plausible central authority\
    \ to assign TLV numbers exists as of\n   today.\n   This document will be periodically\
    \ updated by newer versions in the\n   fashion of [RP94] and successors.  It may\
    \ be replaced at any given\n   point in time by some type of official registry.\n\
    \   This document will not indicate specific documents using the\n   codepoints,\
    \ nor will it resolve the sub-TLV codepoints.\n"
