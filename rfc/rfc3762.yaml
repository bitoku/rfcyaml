- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The H.323 specification [2] defines a means for building\
    \ multimedia\n   communication services over an arbitrary Packet Based Network,\n\
    \   including the Internet.  When H.323 is used in the context of the\n   Internet,\
    \ it would be useful to take advantages of such services as\n   domain name system\
    \ (DNS) and ENUM in order to help facilitate the\n   completion of multimedia\
    \ calls.\n   This document registers an ENUM service for H.323 according to\n\
    \   specifications and guidelines in RFC 3761 [3].\n"
- title: 2.  ENUM Service Registration
  contents:
  - "2.  ENUM Service Registration\n   As defined in [3], the following is a template\
    \ covering information\n   needed for the registration of the enumservice specified\
    \ in this\n   document.\n   -  Service Name: \"E2U+H323\"\n   -  URI Scheme(s):\
    \ \"h323:\"\n   -  Functional Specification: see section \"3. The E2U+H323 ENUM\n\
    \      Service\"\n   -  Security considerations: see section \"5. Security Considerations\"\
    \n   -  Intended usage: COMMON\n   -  Author: Orit Levin\n   -  Any other information\
    \ that the author deems interesting: None\n"
- title: 3.  The E2U+H323 ENUM Service
  contents:
  - "3.  The E2U+H323 ENUM Service\n   This document defines the \"E2U+H323\" service\
    \ to be used in the\n   \"service\" sub-field of the \"enumservice\" as defined\
    \ in [3].\n   The H.323 related ENUM record MUST be populated with a standard\
    \ H.323\n   URL as defined in [2].  This URL MAY include parameters specifying\n\
    \   the specific protocols and the transport means the H.323 entity\n   supports.\n\
    \   The H.323 entity MUST fully comply with the procedures defined in [3]\n  \
    \ for both record retrieval and processing by the DNS client.\n   If, as a result\
    \ of the ENUM DNS lookup, an H.323 URL matching local\n   policies and capabilities\
    \ is retrieved, the procedure defined in\n   section O.8.1 \"Locating H.323 Destination\"\
    \ of [5] SHOULD be\n   performed.\n"

    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The h323-URL information, once populated in the\
    \ DNS, effectively\n   becomes publicly accessible.  The access to the H.323 destinations\n\
    \   (published using ENUM) can be secured by techniques and procedures\n   defined\
    \ in H.235 [4] - the security framework for H.323.  The\n   framework defines\
    \ means for achieving integrity, authentication,\n   non-repudiation, encryption,\
    \ etc. for H.323 calls.  An analysis of\n   threats specific to the dependence\
    \ of ENUM on the DNS, and the\n   applicability of DNSSEC [6] to these, is provided\
    \ in [3].\n"
- title: 6.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   This document registers the E2U+H323 ENUM service\
    \ according to\n   specifications and guidelines in RFC 3761 [3] and the definitions\
