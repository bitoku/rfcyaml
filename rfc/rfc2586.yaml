  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines the audio/L16 MIME type, a reasonable\
    \ quality\n   audio format for use in Internet applications.\n   Possible application\
    \ areas include E-mail, Web served content, file\n   upload in Web forms, and\
    \ more.\n"
- title: 2.  The need for the Audio/L16 MIME type
  contents:
  - "2.  The need for the Audio/L16 MIME type\n   The set of IETF standard MIME types\
    \ for audio is small; it consists\n   of only the audio/basic and audio/32kadpcm\
    \ types, which have a\n   sampling rate of 8000 samples/second.\n   Rates below\
    \ 11025 may obscure consonant information, even for\n   single-voice speech. \
    \ Common compressions, such as LPC, are known to\n   be microphone-dependant and\
    \ lossy.  Thus far all IETF MIME Audio\n   types either default to 8000 samples\
    \ per second or use LPC.\n   In order for advanced speech recognition and related\
    \ educational\n   applications to make use of internet transports (such as RFC\
    \ 1867\n   file uploading) which use MIME typing, higher standards are required.\n\
    \   This type repairs that lack by registering a very simple MIME type\n   that\
    \ allows higher rate, linear-encoded audio with multiple channels.\n   This is\
    \ an IESG approved MIME type, and its definition is therefore\n   published as\
    \ an RFC.\n   Please note that there are many other Audio types described in RFC\n\
    \   1890 [1] which IANA may wish to formally register; this one, of all\n   of\
    \ them, seems to be most immediately needed.  This document may also\n   serve\
    \ as a template for further registrations of these audio types.\n"
- title: 3.  The definition of Audio/L16
  contents:
  - "3.  The definition of Audio/L16\n   Audio/L16 is based on the well know audio\
    \ format \"L16\" described in\n   RFC 1890 section 4.4.8 for use with RTP transport.\
    \  L16 denotes\n   uncompressed audio data, using 16-bit signed representation\
    \ in twos-\n   complement notation and network byte order.  (From section 4.4.8\
    \ of\n   RFC 1890)\n   It may be parametrized by varying the sample rate and the\
    \ number of\n   channels; the parameters are given on the MIME type header.\n\
    \   In order to promote interoperability, only a few rate values are\n   standardized\
    \ here. Other values may NOT be used except by bilateral\n   agreement.\n   If\
    \ multiple audio channels are used, channels are numbered left-to-\n   right,\
    \ starting at one. Samples are put into the data stream from\n   each channel\
    \ in succession; information from lower-numbered channels\n   precedes that from\
    \ higher-numbered channels.\n   For more than two channels, the convention followed\
    \ by the AIFF-C\n   audio interchange format should be followed [1], using the\
    \ following\n   notation:\n      l    left\n      r    right\n      c    center\n\
    \      S    surround\n      F    front\n      R    rear\n      channels    description\

    \  MIME subtype name : L16\n   Required parameters\n        rate: number of samples\
    \ per second -- Permissible values for\n        rate are 8000, 11025, 16000, 22050,\
    \ 24000, 32000, 44100, and\n        48000 samples per second.\n   Optional parameters\n\
    \        channels: how many audio streams are interleaved -- defaults\n      \
    \  to 1; stereo would be 2, etc.  Interleaving takes place\n        between individual\
    \ two-byte samples.\n   Encoding considerations\n        Audio data is binary\
    \ data, and must be encoded for non-binary\n        transport; the Base64 encoding\
    \ is suitable for Email.  Note\n        that audio data does not compress easily\
    \ using lossless\n        compression.\n   Security considerations\n        Audio\
    \ data is believed to offer no security risks.\n   Interoperability considerations\n\
    \        This type is compatible with the encoding used in the WAV\n        (Microsoft\
    \ Windows RIFF) and Apple AIFF union types, and with\n        the public domain\
    \ \"sox\" and \"rateconv\" programs.\n   Published specification\n        RFC\

    \      Common\n        It is expected that many audio and speech applications\
    \ will use\n        this type.  Already the most popular platforms provide this\

- title: 5.  Security considerations

  - "5.  Security considerations\n   The audio data is believed to offer no security\
    \ risks.\n   Note that RFC 1890 permits an application to choose to play a single\n\
    \   channel from a multichannel tranmission; an attacker who knows that\n   two\
    \ different users will pick different channels could concievably\n   construct\
    \ some confusing messages; this, however, is ridiculous.\n   This type is perfect\
    \ for hiding data using steganography.\n"
