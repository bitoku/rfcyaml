- title: 1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of\
    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\
    \ please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [9].\n   Managed objects are accessed\
    \ via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base\
    \ or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management\
    \ Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined\
    \ in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a\
    \ MIB\n   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n\
    \   RFC 2578 [1], STD 58, RFC 2579 [2] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [3].\n"
- title: 2.  Revision History
  contents:
  - "2.  Revision History\n   One of the primary purposes of this revision of the\
    \ IP MIB is to\n   create a single set of objects to describe and manage IP modules\
    \ in\n   an IP version independent manner.  Where RFCs 2465 and 2466 created a\n\
    \   set of objects independent from RFC 2011, this document merges those\n   three\
    \ documents into a single unified set of objects.  The\n   ipSystemStatsTable\
    \ and ipIfStatsTable tables are examples of updating\n   objects to be independent\
    \ of IP version.  Both of these tables\n   contain counters to reflect IP traffic\
    \ statistics that originated in\n   much earlier MIBs and both include an IP address\
    \ type in order to\n   separate the information based on IP version.\n   Another\
    \ purpose of this document is to increase the manageability of\n   a node running\
    \ IPv6 by adding new objects.  Some of these tables,\n   such as ipDefaultRouterTable,\
    \ may be useful on both IPv4 and IPv6\n   nodes while others, such as ipv6RouterAdvertTable,\
    \ are specific to a\n   single protocol.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Multi-Stack Implementations
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Multi-Stack Implementations\n   This MIB does not provide native support\
    \ for implementations of\n   multiple stacks sharing the same address type.  One\
    \ option for\n   supporting such designs is to assign each stack within an address\n\
    \   type to a separate context.  These contexts could then be selected\n   based\
    \ upon the context name, with the Entity MIB and View-based\n   Access Control\
    \ Model (VACM) Context Table providing methods for\n   listing the supported contexts.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Discussion of Tables and Groups
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Discussion of Tables and Groups\n   This MIB is composed of a small number\
    \ of discrete objects and a\n   series of tables meant to form the base for managing\
    \ IPv4 and IPv6\n   entities.\n   While some of the objects are meant to be included\
    \ in all entities,\n   some of the objects are only conditionally mandatory. \
    \ The\n   unconditionally mandatory objects are mostly counters for IP and ICMP\n\
    \   statistics.  The conditionally mandatory objects fall into one of\n   several\
    \ groups: objects for use in higher bandwidth situations,\n   objects for use\
    \ with IPv4, objects for use with IPv6, and objects for\n   use on IPv6 routers.\
    \  In short, it is not expected that every entity\n   will implement all of the\
    \ objects within this MIB.  The reader should\n   consult the conformance and\
    \ compliance section to determine which\n   objects are appropriate for a given\
    \ entity.\n"
- title: 3.2.1.  General Objects
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  General Objects\n   In both IPv4 and IPv6, there are only a small number\
    \ of \"knobs\" for\n   controlling the general IP stack.  Most controls will be\
    \ in a more\n   specific setting, such as for controlling a router or TCP engine.\n\
    \   This MIB defines a total of three general knobs, only two of which\n   are\
    \ used for both IPv4 and IPv6.\n   Objects are included for both protocols to\
    \ enable or disable\n   forwarding and to set limits on the lifetime of a packet\
    \ (ttl or hop\n   count).\n   The third knob, the timeout period for reassembling\
    \ fragments, is\n   only defined for IPv4, as IPv6 specifies this value directly.\n\
    \   Each group of objects is required when implementing their respective\n   protocols.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  Interface Tables
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Interface Tables\n   This MIB includes a pair of tables to convey information\
    \ about the\n   IPv4 and IPv6 protocols that is interface specific.\n   Special\
    \ note should be taken of the administrative status objects.\n   These are defined\
    \ to allow each protocol to selectively enable or\n   disable interfaces.  These\
    \ objects can be used in conjunction with\n   the ifAdminStatus object to manipulate\
    \ the interfaces as necessary.\n   With these three objects, an interface may\
    \ be enabled or disabled\n   completely, as well as connected to the IPv4 stack,\
    \ the IPv6 stack or\n   both stacks.  Setting ifAdminStatus to \"down\" should\
    \ not affect the\n   protocol specific status objects.\n   Each interface table\
    \ is required when implementing their respective\n   protocols.\n"
- title: 3.2.3.  IP Statistics Tables
  contents:
  - "3.2.3.  IP Statistics Tables\n   The IP statistics tables (ipSystemStatsTable\
    \ and ipIfStatsTable)\n   contain objects to count the number of datagrams and\
    \ octets that a\n   given entity has processed.  Unlike the previous attempt,\
    \ this\n   document uses a single table for multiple address types.  Typically\n\
    \   the only two types of interest are IPv4 and IPv6; however, the table\n   can\
    \ support other types if necessary.\n   The first table, ipSystemStatsTable, conveys\
    \ system wide information.\n   (That is, the various counters are for all interfaces\
    \ and not a\n   specific set of interfaces.)  Its index is formed from a single\n\
    \   sub-id that represents the address type for which the statistics were\n  \
    \ counted.\n   The second table, ipIfStatsTable, conveys interface specific\n\
    \   information.  Its index is formed from two sub-ids.  The first\n   represents\
    \ the address type (IPv4 and IPv6), and the interface within\n   that address\
    \ type is represented by the second sub-id.\n   The two tables have a similar\
    \ set of objects that are intended to\n   count the same things, except for the\
    \ difference in granularity.  The\n   object ID \"ipSystemStatsEntry.2\" is reserved\
    \ in order to align the\n   object IDs of the counters in the first table with\
    \ their counterparts\n   in the second table.\n   Several objects to note are\
    \ ipSystemStatsDiscontinuityTime,\n   ipIfStatsDiscontinuityTime, ipSystemsStatsRefreshRate,\
    \ and\n   ipIfStatsRefreshRate.  These objects provide information about the\n\
    \   row in the table more than about the system itself.\n   The discontinuity\
    \ objects allow a management entity to determine if a\n   discontinuity event\
    \ that would invalidate the management entity's\n   understanding of the counters\
    \ has occurred.  The system being re-\n   initialized or the interface being cycled\
    \ are possible examples of a\n   discontinuity event.\n   The refresh objects\
    \ allow a management entity to determine a proper\n   polling interval for the\
    \ rest of the objects.\n   The following Case diagram represents the general ordering\
    \ of the\n   packet counters.  In order to avoid extra clutter, the prefixes\n\
    \   \"ipSystemStats\" and \"ipIfStats\" have been removed from each of the\n \
    \  counter names.\n from                                            from\n interface\

    \ and octet counters are also found at these points\n       but have been left\
    \ out for clarity.\n   (2) The discard counters may increment at any time in the\
    \ processing\n       path.  Packets discarded to the left of InNoRoutes cause\
    \ the\n       InDiscards counter to increment, while those discarded to the\n\
    \       right are counted in the OutDiscards counters.\n   (3) Local packets on\
    \ the input side are counted on the interface\n       associated with their destination\
    \ address, which may not be the\n       interface on which they were received.\
    \  This requirement is\n       caused by the possibility of losing the original\
    \ interface during\n       processing, especially re-assembly.\n   (4) Some re-assembly\
    \ algorithms may lose track of the number of\n       fragments during processing\
    \ and so some fragments may not be\n       counted in this object.\n   (5) InTruncatedPkts\
    \ should only be incremented if the frame contained\n       a valid header but\
    \ was otherwise shorter than required.  Frames\n       that are too short to contain\
    \ a valid header should be counted as\n       InHdrErrors.\n   (6) The forwarding\
    \ objects may be incremented, even for packets that\n       originated locally\
    \ or are destined for the local host, if their\n       addresses are such that\
    \ the local host would need to forward the\n       packet to pass it to the correct\
    \ interface.\n   (7) When fragmenting a packet, an entity should increment the\n\
    \       OutFragFails counter, rather than the OutDiscards counter, in\n      \
    \ order to preserve the equation FragOks + FragFails == FragRqds.\n   The objects\
    \ in both tables are spread amongst several conformance\n   groups based on the\
    \ bandwidth required to wrap the counters within an\n   hour.  The base system\
    \ group is mandatory for all entities.  The\n   other system groups are optional\
    \ depending on bandwidth.  The\n   interface specific-groups are optional.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.9.  Router Advertisement Table\n   This table contains the non-routing information\
    \ that an IPv6 router\n   would use in constructing a router advertisement message.\
    \  It does\n   not contain information about the prefixes or other routing specific\n\
    \   information that the router might advertise.  The router should\n   acquire\

- title: 3.2.10.  ICMP Statistics Tables
  contents:
  - "3.2.10.  ICMP Statistics Tables\n   There are two sets of statistics for ICMP.\
    \  The first contains a\n   simple set of counters to track the number of ICMP\
    \ messages and\n   errors processed by this entity.\n   The second supplies more\
    \ detail about the ICMP messages processed by\n   this entity.  Its index is formed\
    \ from two sub-ids.  The first\n   represents the address type (IPv4 and IPv6),\
    \ and the second\n   represents the particular message type being counted.  A\
    \ given row\n   need not be instantiated unless a message of that type has been\n\
    \   processed, i.e., the row for icmpMsgStatsType=X MAY be instantiated\n   before\
    \ but MUST be instantated after the first message with Type=X is\n   received\
    \ or transmitted.  After receiving or transmitting any\n   succeeding messages\
    \ with Type=X, the relevant counter must be\n   incremented.\n   Both of these\
    \ tables are required for all entities.\n"
- title: 3.2.11.  Conformance and Compliance
  contents:
  - "3.2.11.  Conformance and Compliance\n   This MIB contains several sets of objects.\
    \  Some of these sets are\n   useful on all types of entities, while others are\
    \ only useful on a\n   limited subset of entities.  The conformance section attempts\
    \ to\n   group the objects into sets that may be discussed as units, and the\n\
    \   compliance section then details which of these units are required in\n   various\
    \ circumstances.\n   The circumstances used in the compliance section are implementing\n\
    \   IPv4, IPv6, or IPv6 router functions and having a bandwidth of less\n   than\

- title: 4.  Updating Implementations
  contents:
  - "4.  Updating Implementations\n   There are several general classes of change\
    \ that are required.\n   The first and most major change is that most of the previous\
    \ objects\n   have different object IDs and additional indexes to support the\n\
    \   possibility of different address types.  The general counters for IP\n   and\
    \ ICMP are examples of this.  They have been moved to the\n   ipSystemStatsTable\
    \ and icmpMsgStatsTable, respectively.\n   The second change is the extension\
    \ of all address objects to allow\n   for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and the\
    \ addition of an address type\n   object to specify what address type is in use.\n\
    \   The third change is the addition of several new objects to the\n   replacement\
    \ for a previously existing table such as ipNetToPhysical.\n   The fourth change\
    \ is the addition of completely new tables such as\n   ipIfStatsTable and ipDefaultRouterTable.\
    \  The first is based on the\n   previous statistics groups, while the second\
    \ is completely new to\n   this MIB.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Updating an Implementation of the IPv4-only IP-MIB
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Updating an Implementation of the IPv4-only IP-MIB\n   The somewhat more\
    \ specific changes that are required for IPv4 follow.\n   Note well:  this is\
    \ not meant to be an exhaustive list and the reader\n   should examine the MIB\
    \ for full details.\n   Several of the general objects (ipForwarding, ipDefaultTTL,\n\
    \   ipReasmTimeout) remain unchanged.\n   Most of the rest of the general objects\
    \ were counters and have been\n   moved into the ipSystemStatsTable.  The basic\
    \ instrumentation should\n   remain the same, though the object definitions should\
    \ be checked for\n   clarifications.  If they aren't already in a structure, putting\
    \ the\n   counter variables in one would be useful.  Several new objects have\n\
    \   been added to count additional items, and instrumentation code must\n   be\
    \ added for these objects.  Finally, the SNMP routines must be\n   updated to\
    \ handle the new indexing.\n   In addition to the ipSystemStatsTable, the MIB\
    \ includes the\n   ipIfStatsTable.  This table counts the same items as the system\
    \ table\n   but does so on a per interface basis.  It is optional and may be\n\
    \   ignored.  If you decide to implement it, you may wish to arrange to\n   collect\
    \ the data on a per-interface basis and then sum those counters\n   in order to\
    \ provide the aggregate system level statistics.  However,\n   if you choose to\
    \ provide the system level statistics by summing the\n   interface level counters,\
    \ no interface level statistics can be lost -\n   if an interface is removed,\
    \ the statistics associated with it must be\n   retained.\n   The ipAddrTable\
    \ has, loosely, been converted to the ipAddressTable.\n   While the general idea\
    \ remains the same, the ipAddressTable is\n   sufficiently different that writing\
    \ new code may be easier than\n   updating old code.  The primary difference is\
    \ the addition of several\n   new objects.  In addition, the ipAdEntReasmMaxSize\
    \ has been moved to\n   another table, ipv4InterfaceTable.  As above, the SNMP\
    \ routines will\n   need to be updated to handle the new indexing.\n   The ipNetToMediaTable\
    \ has been moved to the ipNetToPhysicalTable.\n   These tables are fairly similar\
    \ and updating the old code may be\n   straightforward.  As above, the SNMP routines\
    \ will need to be updated\n   to handle the new indexing.\n   Two new tables,\
    \ ipv4InterfaceTable and ipDefaultRouterTable, are\n   required as well as several\
    \ new ICMP counters.\n   Finally, there are several tables that are required for\
    \ IPv6 but are\n   optional for IPv4 that you may elect to implement.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Updating an Implementation of the IPv6-MIB
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Updating an Implementation of the IPv6-MIB\n   The somewhat more specific\
    \ changes that are required for IPv6 follow.\n   Note well:  this is not meant\
    \ to be an exhaustive list and the reader\n   should examine the MIB for full\
    \ details.\n   Two of the general objects, ipv6Forwarding and ipv6DefaultHopLimit,\n\
    \   have been renamed and given new object identifiers within the ip\n   branch\
    \ but are otherwise unchanged.  The new names are\n   ipv6IpForwarding and ipv6IpDefaultHopLimit.\n\
    \   While there is an ipv6InterfaceTable that contains some of the pieces\n  \
    \ from the ipv6IfTable, the two are somewhat different in concept.  The\n   ipv6IfTable\
    \ was meant to replicate the ifTable while the\n   ipv6InterfaceTable is meant\
    \ to be an addition to the ifTable.  As\n   such, items that were duplicated between\
    \ the ifTable and ipv6IfTable\n   have been removed and some new objects added.\n\
    \   The ipv6IfStatsTable most closely resembles the ipIfStatsTable with\n   an\
    \ additional index for the address type and most of the\n   instrumentation should\
    \ be re-usable.  Some new objects have been\n   added to the ipIfStatsTable. \
    \ As above, the SNMP routines will need\n   to be updated to handle the new indexing.\
    \  Finally, the\n   ipIfStatsTable is optional and may be ignored.\n   The ipSystemStatsTable\
    \ is effectively new, but it may be able to make\n   use of most of the instrumentation\
    \ from the old ipv6IfStatsTable.  As\n   with the IPv4 discussion, one implementation\
    \ strategy would be to\n   count the statistics for the ipIfStatsTable and aggregate\
    \ them when\n   queried for this table.  Again, as with the IPv4 discussion, this\n\
    \   strategy only works if the interfaces cannot be removed or if the\n   statistics\
    \ for removed interfaces are somehow retained.\n   The ipv6AddrPrefixTable is\
    \ now the ipAddressPrefixTable.  The new\n   table contains an extra object and\
    \ the additional index required for\n   IPv4 compatibility.  As above, the SNMP\
    \ routines will need to be\n   updated to handle the new indexing.\n   The ipAddressTable\
    \ is loosely based on the ipv6AddrTable but has\n   changed considerably with\
    \ the addition of several new objects and the\n   removal of one of its indexes.\n\
    \   The IPv6 routing information (ipv6RouteNumber, ipv6DiscardedRoutes,\n   and\
    \ ipv6RouteTable) has been removed from this MIB.  The replacements\n   or updates\
    \ for this information is in the update to the IP Forwarding\n   Table MIB [16].\
    \  The ipv6NetToMediaTable has been converted to the\n   ipNetToPhysicalTable.\
    \  The new table contains an extra object and the\n   additional index required\
    \ for IPv4 compatibility.  As above, the SNMP\n   routines will need to be updated\
    \ to handle the new indexing.\n   The ICMP tables have been substantially changed.\
    \  The previous tables\n   required counting on a per-message and per-interface\
    \ basis.  The new\n   tables only require counting on a per-message, per-protocol\
    \ basis and\n   include an aggregate of all messages on a per-protocol basis.\n\
    \   In addition to the above, several new tables have been added.  Both\n   the\
    \ ipv6ScopeZoneIndexTable and ipDefaultRouterTable are required on\n   all IPv6\
    \ entities.  The ipv6RouterAdvertTable is only required on\n   IPv6 routers.\n"

    \  Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n\

    \  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n\
    \      ipForwarding and ipv6IpForwarding - these objects allow a manager\n   \
    \   to enable or disable the routing functions on the entity.  By\n      disabling\
    \ the routing functions, an attacker would possibly be\n      able to deny service\
    \ to users.  By enabling the routing functions,\n      an attacker could open\
    \ a conduit into an area.  This might result\n      in the area providing transit\
    \ for packets it shouldn't or might\n      allow the attacker access to the area\
    \ bypassing security\n      safeguards.\n      ipDefaultTTL and ipv6IpDefaultHopLimit\
    \ - these objects allow a\n      manager to determine the diameter of the valid\
    \ area for a packet.\n      By decreasing the value of these objects, an attacker\
    \ could cause\n      packets to be discarded before reaching their destinations.\n\
    \      ipv4InterfaceEnableStatus and ipv6InterfaceEnableStatus - these\n     \
    \ objects allow a manager to enable or disable IPv4 and IPv6 on a\n      specific\
    \ interface.  By enabling a protocol on an interface, an\n      attacker might\
    \ be able to create an unsecured path into a node (or\n      through it if routing\
    \ is also enabled).  By disabling a protocol\n      on an interface, an attacker\
    \ might be able to force packets to be\n      routed through some other interface\
    \ or deny access to some or all\n      of the network via that protocol.\n   \
    \   ipAddressTable - the objects in this table specify the addresses\n      in\
    \ use on this node.  By modifying this information, an attacker\n      can cause\
    \ a node to either ignore messages destined to it or\n      accept (at least at\
    \ the IP layer) messages it would otherwise\n      ignore.  The use of filtering\
    \ or security associations may reduce\n      the potential damage in the latter\
    \ case.\n      ipv6RouterAdvertTable - the objects in this table specify the\n\
    \      information that a router should propagate in its routing\n      advertisement\
    \ messages.  By modifying this information, an\n      attacker can interfere with\
    \ the auto-configuration of all hosts on\n      the link.  Most modifications\
    \ to this table will result in a\n      denial of service to some or all hosts\
    \ on the link.  However two\n      objects, ipv6RouterAdvertManagedFlag and\n\
    \      ipv6RouterAdvertOtherConfigFlag, indicate if a host should acquire\n  \
    \    configuration information from some other source.  By enabling\n      these,\
    \ an attacker might be able to cause a host to retrieve its\n      configuration\
    \ information from a compromised source.\n      ipNetToPhysicalPhysAddress and\
    \ ipNetToPhysicalType - these objects\n      specify information used to translate\
    \ a network (IP) address into\n      a media dependent address.  By modifying\
    \ these objects, an\n      attacker could disable communication with a node or\
    \ divert\n      messages from one node to another.  However, the attacker may\
    \ be\n      able to carry out a similar attack by simply responding to the ARP\n\
    \      or ND request made by the target node.\n   Some of the readable objects\
    \ in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible)\
    \ may be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.\
    \  It is thus important to\n   control even GET access to these objects and possibly\
    \ to even encrypt\n   the values of these objects when sending them over the network\
    \ via\n   SNMP.\n   These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:\n\
    \      Essentially, all of the objects in this MIB could be considered\n     \
    \ sensitive as they report on the status of the IP modules within a\n      system.\
    \  However, the ipSystemStatsTable, ipIfStatsTable, and\n      ipAddressTable\
    \ are likely to be of most interest to an attacker.\n      The statistics tables\
    \ supply information about the quantity and\n      type of traffic this node is\
    \ processing and, especially for\n      transit providers, may be considered sensitive.\
    \  The address table\n      provides a convenient list of all addresses in use\
    \ by this node.\n      Each address in isolation is unremarkable, however, the\
    \ total list\n      would allow an attacker to correlate otherwise unrelated traffic.\n\
    \      For example, an attacker might be able to correlate an RFC 3041\n     \
    \ [15] private address with known public addresses, thus\n      circumventing\
    \ the intentions of RFC 3041.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include\
    \ adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by\
    \ using IPSec),\n   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network\
    \ is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n\
    \   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security\
    \ features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [9], section 8), including\
    \ full\n   support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication\n\
    \   and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is\
    \ NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n \
    \  enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility\
    \ to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB\
    \ module, is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those\
    \ principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)\
    \ them.\n"
