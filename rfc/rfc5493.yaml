- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In a typical, traditional transport network scenario, data\
    \ plane\n   connections between two end-points are controlled by means of a\n\
    \   Network Management System (NMS) operating within the management plane\n  \
    \ (MP).  The NMS/MP is the owner of such transport connections, being\n   responsible\
    \ of their setup, teardown, and maintenance.  Provisioned\n   connections of this\
    \ type, initiated and managed by the management\n   plane, are known as permanent\
    \ connections (PCs) [G.8081].\n   When the setup, teardown, and maintenance of\
    \ connections are achieved\n   by means of a signaling protocol owned by the control\
    \ plane (CP),\n   such connections are known as switched connections (SCs) [G.8081].\n\
    \   In many deployments, a hybrid connection type will be used.  A soft\n   permanent\
    \ connection (SPC) is a combination of a permanent connection\n   segment at the\
    \ source-user-to-network side, a permanent connection\n   segment at the destination-user-to-network\
    \ side, and a switched\n   connection segment within the core network.  The permanent\
    \ parts of\n   the SPC are owned by the management plane, and the switched parts\
    \ are\n   owned by the control plane [G.8081].\n   Note, some aspects of a control-plane-initiated\
    \ connection must be\n   capable of being queried/controlled by the management\
    \ plane.  These\n   aspects should be independent of how the connection was established.\n"

- title: 2.  Label Switched Path Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Label Switched Path Terminology\n   A Label Switched Path (LSP) has different\
    \ semantics depending on the\n   plane in which the term is used.\n   In the data\
    \ plane, an LSP indicates the data plane forwarding path.\n   It defines the forwarding\
    \ or switching operations at each network\n   entity.  It is the sequence of data\
    \ plane resources (links, labels,\n   cross-connects) that achieves end-to-end\
    \ data transport.\n   In the management plane, an LSP is the management plane\
    \ state\n   information (such as the connection attributes and path information)\n\
    \   associated with and necessary for the creation and maintenance of a\n   data\
    \ plane connection.\n   In the control plane, an LSP is the control plane state\
    \ information\n   (such as the RSVP-TE [RFC3473] Path and Resv state) associated\
    \ with\n   and necessary for the creation and maintenance of a data plane\n  \
    \ connection.\n   A permanent connection has an LSP presence in the data plane\
    \ and the\n   management plane.  A switched connection has an LSP presence in\
    \ the\n   data plane and the control plane.  An SPC has an LSP presence in the\n\
    \   data plane for its entire length, but has a management plane presence\n  \
    \ for part of its length and a control plane presence for part of its\n   length.\n\
    \   In this document, when we discuss the LSP conversion between\n   management\
    \ plane and control plane, we mainly focus on the conversion\n   of control plane\
    \ state information and management plane state\n   information.\n"
- title: 3.  LSP within GMPLS Control Plane
  contents:
  - "3.  LSP within GMPLS Control Plane\n   GMPLS ([RFC3471], [RFC3473], and [RFC3945])\
    \ defines a control plane\n   architecture for transport networks.  This includes\
    \ both routing and\n   signaling protocols for the creation and maintenance of\
    \ LSPs in\n   networks whose data plane is based on different technologies, such\
    \ as\n   Time Division Multiplexing (SDH/SONET, G.709 at ODUk level) and\n   Wavelength\
    \ Division Multiplexing (G.709 at OCh level).\n"
- title: 3.1.  Resource Ownership
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Resource Ownership\n   A resource used by an LSP is said to be 'owned'\
    \ by the plane that was\n   used to set up the LSP through that part of the network.\
    \  Thus, all\n   the resources used by a permanent connection are owned by the\n\
    \   management plane, and all the resources used by a switched connection\n  \
    \ are owned by the control plane.  The resources used by an SPC are\n   divided\
    \ between the management plane (for the resources used by the\n   permanent connection\
    \ segments at the edge of the network) and the\n   control plane (for the resources\
    \ used by the switched connection\n   segments in the middle of the network).\n\
    \   The division of resources available for ownership by the management\n   and\
    \ control planes is an architectural issue.  A carrier may decide\n   to pre-partition\
    \ the resources at a network entity so that LSPs under\n   management plane control\
    \ use one set of resources and LSPs under\n   control plane control use another\
    \ set of resources.  Other carriers\n   may choose to make this distinction resource-by-resource\
    \ as LSPs are\n   established.\n   It should be noted, however, that even when\
    \ a resource is owned by\n   the control plane it will usually be the case that\
    \ the management\n   plane has a controlling interest in the resource.  For example,\n\
    \   consider the basic safety requirements that management commands must\n   be\
    \ able to put a laser out of service.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Setting Up a GMPLS-Controlled Network
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Setting Up a GMPLS-Controlled Network\n   The implementation of a new network\
    \ using a Generalized Multiprotocol\n   Label Switching (GMPLS) control plane\
    \ may be considered as a green\n   field deployment.  But in many cases, it is\
    \ desirable to introduce a\n   GMPLS control plane into an existing transport\
    \ network that is\n   already populated with permanent connections under management\
    \ plane\n   control.\n   In a mixed scenario, permanent connections owned by the\
    \ management\n   plane and switched connections owned by the control plane have\
    \ to\n   coexist within the network.\n   It is also desirable to transfer the\
    \ control of connections from the\n   management plane to the control plane so\
    \ that connections that were\n   originally under the control of an NMS are now\
    \ under the control of\n   the GMPLS protocols.  In case such connections are\
    \ in service, such\n   conversion must be performed in a way that does not affect\
    \ traffic.\n   Since attempts to move an LSP under GMPLS control might fail due\
    \ to a\n   number of reasons outside the scope of this document, it is also\n\
    \   highly desirable to have a mechanism to convert the control of an LSP\n  \
    \ back to the management plane.\n   Note that a permanent connection may be converted\
    \ to a switched\n   connection or to an SPC, and an SPC may be converted to a\
    \ switched\n   connection as well (PC to SC, PC to SPC, and SPC to SC).  So the\n\
    \   reverse mappings may also be needed (SC to PC, SPC to PC, and SC to\n   SPC).\n\
    \   Conversion to/from control/management will occur in MIBs or in\n   information\
    \ stored on the device (e.g., cross-connect, label\n   assignment, label stacking,\
    \ etc.) and is identified as either\n   initiated by a specific control protocol\
    \ or by manual operation\n   (i.e., via an NMS).  When converting, this hop-level\
    \ owner\n   information needs to be completed for all hops.  If conversion cannot\n\
    \   be done for all hops, then the conversion must be done for no hops,\n   the\
    \ state of the hop-level information must be restored to that\n   before the conversion\
    \ was attempted, and an error condition must be\n   reported to the management\
    \ system.\n   In either case of conversion, the management plane shall initiate\
    \ the\n   change.  When converting from a PC to an SC, the management system\n\
    \   must indicate to each hop that a control protocol is now to be used,\n   and\
    \ then configure the data needed by the control protocol at the\n   connection\
    \ endpoints.  When converting from an SC to a PC, the\n   management plane must\
    \ change the owner of each hop.  Then the\n   instance in the control plane must\
    \ be removed without affecting the\n   data plane.\n   The case where the CP and/or\
    \ MP fail at one or more nodes during the\n   conversion procedure must be handled\
    \ in the solution.  If the network\n   is viewed as the database of record (including\
    \ data, control, and\n   management plane elements), then a solution that has\
    \ procedures\n   similar to those of a two-phase database commit process may be\
    \ needed\n   to ensure integrity and to support the need to revert to the state\n\
    \   prior to the conversion attempt if there is a CP and/or MP failure\n   during\
    \ the attempted conversion.\n"

    \   possibly carrying traffic, are already set up as PCs and are owned by\n  \
    \ the management plane.\n   At a latter stage, when the network is partially controlled\
