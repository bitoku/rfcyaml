Abstract This document registers an Enumservice for the Inter Asterisk eXchange (IAX) protocol according to the guidelines given in RFC 6117.
The E.164 to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)
[RFC3986] Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Application (ENUM)
[RFC6116] transforms E.164 [E164] numbers into URIs using the Domain Name System (DNS)
[RFC5456] is an "all in one" protocol for handling multimedia in IP networks.
It combines both control and media services in the same protocol.
This document registers an Enumservice for the IAX [RFC5456] protocol according to the guidelines given in [RFC6117].
The 'iax' Enumservice is used to map E.164 numbers to IAX URIs.
Such URIs identify resources capable of being contacted to provide a communication session using the IAX protocol <xref target "RFC5456"/>.
> A client selecting this NAPTR needs to be able to support communication utilizing the IAX protocol.

The following examples are just for illustrative purposes and will in no way limit the usage of the 'iax' Enumservice to other usage scenarios.
The following Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) resource record is an example of the 'iax' Enumservice.
10 100 "u" "E2U iax" "!
This contact information indicates that the party addressed by the E.164 number  442079460148 can be contacted using the IAX protocol to domain 'example.com'.
The called party, service, or program on that domain is identified by 'alice'.
IAX URI with a Context
The following is an example of the 'iax' Enumservice using an IPv6 destination address and a destination 'context'.
10 100 "u" "E2U iax" "!
This NAPTR resource record indicates that  442079460149 may be contacted by using the IAX protocol at IPv6 address 2001:
db8::1, port 4569 with the called party 'alice' in the context (or user partition) 'friends'.
For further usage of IAX URIs, see Section 5 of [RFC5456].
The 'iax' Enumservice does not introduce any new security issues beyond any already present in the ENUM, DNS, and IAX protocols, except that this Enumservice provides for disclosure of information that may facilitate an attack or a violation of user privacy in some way.
The primary result of these exploits is unwanted communications.
These issues are discussed in further detail in [RFC3833].
The use of DNS Security (DNSSEC) [RFC4033] is recommended to improve operational security.
For security considerations that apply to all Enumservices, please refer to RFC 6116, Section 7.
This document registers the 'iax' Enumservice according to the guidelines and specifications in [RFC6117] and the definitions in Section 2 in this document.
DNS Considerations Misconfiguration or delays in zone changes can result in call loops, perhaps with different protocols or networks.
Implementations should take care to ensure such loops can be detected without interrupting other services, including SIP based, IAX based, and DNS itself.
