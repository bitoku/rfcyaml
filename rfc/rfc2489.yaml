  - "Abstract\n   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a framework\n\
    \   for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP network.\n   Configuration\
    \ parameters and other control information are carried in\n   tagged data items\
    \ that are stored in the 'options' field of the DHCP\n   message.  The data items\
    \ themselves are also called \"options.\"\n   New DHCP options may be defined\
    \ after the publication of the DHCP\n   specification to accommodate requirements\
    \ for conveyance of new\n   configuration parameters.  This document describes\
    \ the procedure for\n   defining new DHCP options.\n"

  - "1. Introduction\n   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [1] provides\
    \ a\n   framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP\n\
    \   network.  Configuration parameters and other control information are\n   carried\
    \ in tagged data items that are stored in the 'options' field\n   of the DHCP\
    \ message.  The data items themselves are also called\n   \"options.\" [2]\n \
    \  This document describes the procedure for defining new DHCP options.\n   The\
    \ procedure will guarantee that:\n   * allocation of new option numbers is coordinated\
    \ from a single\n     authority,\n   * new options are reviewed for technical\
    \ correctness and\n     appropriateness, and\n   * documentation for new options\
    \ is complete and published.\n   As indicated in \"Guidelines for Writing an IANA\
    \ Considerations\n   Section in RFCs\" (see references), IANA acts as a central\
    \ authority\n   for assignment of numbers such as DHCP option codes.  The new\n\
    \   procedure outlined in this document will provide guidance to IANA in\n   the\
    \ assignment of new option codes.\n"
- title: 2. Overview and background
  contents:
  - "2. Overview and background\n   The procedure described in this document modifies\
    \ and clarifies the\n   procedure for defining new options in RFC 2131 [2].  The\
    \ primary\n   modification is to the time at which a new DHCP option is assigned\
    \ an\n   option number.  In the procedure described in this document, the\n  \
    \ option number is not assigned until specification for the option is\n   about\
    \ to be published as an RFC.\n   Since the publication of RFC 2132, the option\
    \ number space for\n   publically defined DHCP options (1-127) has almost been\
    \ exhausted.\n   Many of the defined option numbers have not been followed up\
    \ with\n   Internet Drafts submitted to the DHC WG.  There has been a lack of\n\
    \   specific guidance to IANA from the DHC WG as to the assignment of\n   DHCP\
    \ option numbers\n   The procedure as specified in RFC 2132 does not clearly state\
    \ that\n   new options are to be reviewed individually for technical\n   correctness,\
    \ appropriateness and complete documentation.  RFC 2132\n   also does not require\
    \ that new options are to be submitted to the\n   IESG for review, and that the\
    \ author of the option specification is\n   responsible for bringing new options\
    \ to the attention of the IESG.\n   Finally, RFC 2132 does not make clear that\
    \ newly defined options are\n   not to be incorporated into products, included\
    \ in other\n   specifications or otherwise used until the specification for the\n\
    \   option is published as an RFC.\n   In the future, new DHCP option codes will\
    \ be assigned by IETF\n   consensus.  New DHCP options will be documented in RFCs\
    \ approved by\n   the IESG, and the codes for those options will be assigned at\
    \ the\n   time the relevant RFCs are published.  Typically, the IESG will seek\n\
    \   input on prospective assignments from appropriate sources (e.g., a\n   relevant\
    \ Working Group if one exists).  Groups of related options may\n   be combined\
    \  into a single specification and reviewed as a set by the\n   IESG.  Prior to\
    \ assignment of an option code, it is not appropriate\n   to incorporate new options\
    \ into products, include the specification\n   in other documents or otherwise\
    \ make use of the new options.\n   The DHCP option number space (1-254) is split\
    \ into two parts.  The\n   site-specific options (128-254) are defined as \"Private\
    \ Use\" and\n   require no review by the DHC WG.  The public options (1-127) are\n\
    \   defined as \"Specification Required\" and new options must be reviewed\n \
    \  prior to assignment of an option number by IANA.  The details of the\n   review\
    \ process are given in the following section of this document.\n"
- title: 3. Procedure
  contents:
  - "3. Procedure\n   The author of a new DHCP option will follow these steps to obtain\n\
    \   approval for the option and publication of the specification of the\n   option\
    \ as an RFC:\n   1. The author devises the new option.\n   2. The author documents\
    \ the new option, leaving the option code as\n      \"To Be Determined\" (TBD),\
    \ as an Internet Draft.\n      The requirement that the new option be documented\
    \ as an Internet\n      Draft is a matter of expediency.  In theory, the new option\
    \ could\n      be documented on the back of an envelope for submission; as a\n\
    \      practical matter, the specification will eventually become an\n      Internet\
    \ Draft as part of the review process.\n   3. The author submits the Internet\
    \ Draft for review by the IESG.\n      Preferably, the author will submit the\
    \ Internet Draft to the DHC\n      Working Group, but the author may choose to\
    \ submit the Internet\n      Draft directly to the IESG.\n      Note that simply\
    \ publishing the new option as an Internet Draft\n      does not automatically\
    \ bring the option to the attention of the\n      IESG.  The author of the new\
    \ option must explicitly forward a\n      request for action on the new option\
    \ to the DHC WG or the IESG.\n   4. The specification of the new option is reviewed\
    \ by the IESG.  The\n      specification is reviewed by the DHC WG (if it exists)\
    \ or by the\n      IETF.  If the option is accepted for inclusion in the DHCP\n\
    \      specification, the specification of the option is published as an\n   \
    \   RFC.  It may be published as either a standards-track or a non-\n      standards-track\
    \ RFC.\n   5. At the time of publication as an RFC, IANA assigns a DHCP option\n\
    \      number to the new option.\n"

- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   Information that creates or updates an option\
    \ number assignment needs\n   to be authenticated.\n   An analysis of security\
    \ issues is required for all newly defined DHCP\n   options.  The description\
    \ of security issues in the specification of\n   new options must be as accurate\
    \ as possible.  The specification for a\n   new option may reference the \"Security\
    \ Considerations\" section in the\n   DHCP specification [1]; e.g. (from \"NetWare/IP\
    \ Domain Name and\n   Information\" [3]):\n      DHCP currently provides no authentication\
    \ or security mechanisms.\n      Potential exposures to attack are discussed in\
    \ section 7 of the\n      DHCP protocol specification [RFC 2131].\n"
- title: 6. IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. IANA Considerations\n   RFC 2132 provided guidance to the IANA on the procedure\
    \ it should\n   follow when assigning option numbers for new DHCP options.  This\n\
    \   document updates and replaces those instructions.  In particular,\n   IANA\
    \ is requested to assign DHCP option numbers only for options that\n   have been\
    \ approved for publication as RFCs; i.e., documents that have\n   been approved\
    \ through \"IETF consensus\" as defined in RFC 2434 [4].\n"
