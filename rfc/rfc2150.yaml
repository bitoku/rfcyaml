- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   This document has been structured to provide information\
    \ about, and\n   examples of, the wide range of functions and capabilities available\n\
    \   on the Internet today.  It is intended to illustrate the potential of\n  \
    \ current networking technologies for personal and cultural growth.\n   Some basic\
    \ functions of the Internet are described, along with their\n   applications and\
    \ forums for building online communities of interest,\n   such as the World Wide\
    \ Web, Email, and Network News.\n   This is followed by discussion and examples\
    \ of hardware and software\n   being used to support the creation and presentation\
    \ of artistic and\n   literary works, along with examples of how Arts and Humanities\n\
    \   content is being represented, stored, and retrieved on the Internet.\n   In\
    \ addition to illustrating the great potential of the Internet, this\n   document\
    \ provides a brief introduction to the issues and challenges\n   that affect the\
    \ development and presentation of Arts and Humanities\n   content online, such\
    \ as privacy and property rights.\n   Included is a brief Glossary, and a number\
    \ of Appedices which provide\n   pointers to other sources of information about\
    \ the Internet.\n"
- title: 1.1 Definitions of Arts and Humanities
  contents:
  - "1.1 Definitions of Arts and Humanities\n   For purposes of this document the\
    \ term \"Arts\" includes, but is not\n   limited to, dance, design arts, folk\
    \ arts, literary arts, media and\n   film arts, music, theater, and visual arts.\n\
    \   The term \"Humanities\" includes, but is not limited to, the study of\n  \
    \ the following: language, both modern and classical; linguistics;\n   literature;\
    \ history; jurisprudence philosophy; archaeology;\n   comparative religion; ethics;\
    \ the history, criticism and theory of\n   the arts; those aspects of social sciences\
    \ which have humanistic\n   content and employ humanistic methods; and the study\
    \ and application\n   of the humanities to the human environment.\n   For purposes\
    \ of simplicity this document will use the word \"Artist\"\n   to mean both Artist\
    \ and Humanist: \"all practitioners who work in the\n   fields of the visual,\
    \ performance, and literary arts, as well as\n   museum curators, librarians,\
    \ and others who are involved in the\n   research, restoration, and presentation\
    \ of that which comprises our\n   cultural heritage.\"\n"
- title: 2. What does the Internet mean to the Artist?
  contents:
  - "2. What does the Internet mean to the Artist?\n   The Internet is exerting a\
    \ profound influence on our society.  Even\n   now in its infancy, the effects\
    \ of the Internet can be easily seen in\n   popular media as well as in the way\
    \ we do business.  But the most\n   dramatic influences are in the children who\
    \ are now growing up with\n   the net.  Many parents are aware of the influence\
    \ television has over\n   their children.  With the advent of WEB-TV, the Internet\
    \ has begun to\n   assimilate Television, transforming it into something more\
    \ powerful.\n   This coming integration of information, communication and\n  \
    \ entertainment will play a major role in teaching and shaping the\n   minds of\
    \ those who live and grow up with it.\n   Because of this power, it is critical\
    \ that the best parts of human\n   culture are represented on the Internet. If\
    \ we raise the Internet\n   right, it will return the favor by nurturing a generation\
    \ that may\n   well grow up wiser than ourselves.\n   This is where artists are\
    \ needed.  Because the net is primarily built\n   and run by Scientists and Engineers\
    \ who are creatures of mind, it is\n   the heart and soul of the Internet that\
    \ is weak.  Artists are the\n   heart and soul of human culture, and must bring\
    \ the fruits of their\n   efforts to the net to give the net culture, and future\
    \ generations\n   their essence of humanity.\n   If that does not convince you,\
    \ we will also introduce you to some of\n   the many tools artists may use to\
    \ exploit the net for their own\n   personal gain.  As the online culture becomes\
    \ a more balanced\n   representation of humanity, the net will become an essential\
    \ tool for\n   collaboration, communication, and distribution of art and humanities\n\
    \   content.  The day is coming where those who are not on the net will\n   be\
    \ greatly handicapped in the expression and distribution of their\n   works.\n\
    \   The net is the new frontier for the growth of humanity.  Can you\n   afford\
    \ not to be involved?\n"
- title: 2.1 Access to the Global Community
  contents:
  - "2.1 Access to the Global Community\n   In the past, artist's audiences and collaborators\
    \ were limited to the\n   people around them.  Improvements in transportation\
    \ and communication\n   have allowed these associations to expand, but even today\
    \ few members\n   of the artistic community have gone global.  The Internet changes\
    \ all\n   this by allowing anyone access to a global community.\n   A great many\
    \ arts institutions and organizations have now established\n   sites on the World\
    \ Wide Web and a significant number of online\n   discussion groups focus on the\
    \ arts and humanities.  Consortiums of\n   museums and libraries are now using\
    \ networking technologies to\n   support research and projects involving more\
    \ effective ways to\n   collect, store, and disseminate objects of antiquity and\
    \ other non-\n   textual primary sources, as well as textual sources.\n   Sites\
    \ are also created by individuals and for institutions,\n   organizations, and\
    \ businesses for reasons ranging from commerce to\n   simple self-expression.\
    \  The Internet connects hundreds of countries,\n   thousands of cities, and countless\
    \ groups and individuals around the\n   globe.\n   On the Internet today you can\
    \ find information on topics ranging from\n   art and music to guns and ammunition;\
    \ among which are astronomy,\n   news, astrology, agriculture, acupuncture, botany,\
    \ biology, zoology,\n   food, psychology, medicine, space exploration, genetics,\
    \ media,\n   chemistry, microbreweries, aeronautics, scuba diving, meteorology,\n\
    \   neurology, artificial intelligence, mathematics, literature, wine\n   tasting,\
    \ law, painting, photography, dance, history, social sciences,\n   politics, crafts,\
    \ clothing, economics, genealogy, pets, sports,\n   languages, dictionaries, encyclopedias,\
    \ technical manuals, schools,\n   shops, entertainment, furniture, flowers, software,\
    \ hardware,\n   computers and the Internet, just to name a few.  Whatever your\
    \ work\n   requires, whatever your whim desires, you can find it on the net.\n\
    \   People all around the world will be looking for what they want on the\n  \
    \ net, and if you have what they want, then through the magic of the\n   Internet,\
    \ you are their next door neighbor.\n   With access to the Internet, the world\
    \ is at your fingertips.  Bring\n   your questions on health, the environment,\
    \ government, and religion,\n   and look though volumes of documentation on your\
    \ concerns, or discuss\n   your questions with others electronically.  Once you\
    \ get used to it,\n   you will even be downloading more information and tools\
    \ to assist you\n   further.\n   The Internet provides a forum in which diverse\
    \ cultures can merge,\n   and allows people to visit faraway places from the privacy\
    \ and safety\n   of their own computer.  The Internet explorer will also find\
    \ that\n   many sites are multilingual.\n   Once you have the basic tools for\
    \ using the Internet you will begin\n   to understand how easy, helpful, informative,\
    \ and exciting it can be.\n   With a few quick strokes you have accessed a great\
    \ library, museum,\n   or gallery, toured a faraway city, or looked up an old\
    \ friend.  You\n   might find an out of print book you have always wanted, then\
    \ either\n   read it on your computer screen, or print it out on your printer.\
    \  If\n   you do not have a printer, simply save it to your floppy disk and\n\
    \   bring that to a printshop or friend with a printer.  It really is\n   that\
    \ easy.\n   You could spend the afternoon at the Smithsonian, or the Louvre\n\
    \   without ever leaving your chair.  For a more athletic adventure, you\n   could\
    \ put your computer in front of your treadmill, and jog through\n   the online\
    \ Olympics site.\n   When you are ready, you can explore deeper.  Follow other\
    \ links to\n   smaller sites, lesser known writers, artists, poets, and thinkers,\n\
    \   and discover the emerging world they are creating.  With the proper\n   tools\
    \ you can even view moving pictures, and listen to music and\n   other audio.\n\
    \   Perhaps you would like to locate a rare album, or debate one\n   musicians\
    \ merit over anothers.  Perhaps you prefer to discuss and\n   compare the works\
    \ of others with producers, collectors, gallery\n   owners or other professionals\
    \ in your field, or related fields.  You\n   might want to find out who's hot\
    \ and why.  You could also find out\n   where, and when shows, showings, benefits,\
    \ conferences, releases,\n   signings, and performances are taking place, or announce\
    \ your own.\n   They say that for every artist, there is a critic, and you could\
    \ meet\n   one, or be one, on the Internet.\n"
- title: 2.2 Sharing Your Work and Collaborating with Others
  contents:
  - "2.2 Sharing Your Work and Collaborating with Others\n   Artists often want to\
    \ share their work with other artists so that\n   they can get peer comments and\
    \ recognition.  The Internet is a great\n   place to explore new ideas with other\
    \ artists as well.\n   Perhaps you are a painter who has developed a method for\
    \ keeping\n   acrylics moist during long sessions, or a photographer who has\n\
    \   discovered a new lighting technique.  You could make the information\n   available\
    \ over the Internet to enlighten others, or to get their\n   feedback.\n   Perhaps\
    \ you've had difficulty in some aspect of your work, and you'd\n   like to talk\
    \ to others who have had similar experiences to find out\n   how they solved them.\n\
    \   There are many types of content that artists can share.  Including:\n    \
    \  - text: stories, poetry, historic accounts, transcripts, etc.\n      - images\
    \ of their visual work: paintings, photographs,\n        sculpture, etc.\n   \
    \   - images of themselves: photographs, self-portraits, etc.\n      - sound files\
    \ of their audio works or voice presentations of\n        their works: books on\
    \ tape, speeches, tutorials, music, etc.\n      - moving pictures: video arts,\
    \ performance arts, etc.\n      - a description of their art process and works\
    \ of art\n      - resumes and biographical data\n      - contact information in\
    \ the form of electronic mail address,\n        postal mail address, phone, etc.\
    \  Electronic mail is most\n        popular because it allows people to respond\
    \ spontaneously.\n   After you've met some of the global critics, and compared\
    \ your work\n   with others, you may feel so bold as to share your work with others.\n\
    \   Perhaps emailing a manuscript to a publisher, or putting up scans of\n   your\
    \ art will entice a buyer.  Perhaps it will entice a critic to say\n   wonderful\
    \ things about your work.\n   Perhaps putting your work on the Internet will bring\
    \ fortune and\n   fame, or perhaps it will encourage others to put their work\
    \ up.\n   Increasing the cultural content of the Internet will have profound\n\
    \   results in all areas of the Arts.\n   There are many ways of collaborating\
    \ over the Internet.  As mentioned\n   in previous sections it is easy to see\
    \ how to communicate and\n   exchange work with other artists from anywhere in\
    \ the world.  In\n   addition, there are art and literature projects which explore\
    \ the\n   Internet by asking people to submit their feelings, thoughts, and\n\
    \   ideas through the Internet.  Some of these projects will allow\n   interested\
    \ people to come to them, others may be distributed in\n   various ways to actively\
    \ seek out people interested in participation.\n   There are also games which\
    \ are played over the Internet, by players\n   all over the planet.  These types\
    \ of games, which are described in\n   greater detail in Section 5, can be both\
    \ entertaining and\n   educational.  Some games offer players the opportunity\
    \ to alter the\n   environment, so that ideas and information contained in the\
    \ game\n   evolve over time into a jointly constructed experience.\n"
- title: 2.3 Freely Available Software, and Other Information
  contents:
  - "2.3 Freely Available Software, and Other Information\n   There is a world of\
    \ useful software available to you via the\n   Internet.  Known as Shareware,\
    \ Public Domain, or Freely Copyable, you\n   can find many software programs you\
    \ may download and use on your own\n   machine, often completely free, occasionally\
    \ for a small and/or\n   optional fee which helps the author to afford to create\
    \ more software\n   for general use. There are also libraries, stores, and news\
    \ groups\n   you can peruse in search of just the tool or information you want.\n\
    \   As you explore the Internet, you will begin to find information that\n   is\
    \ beyond your reach without the right tools for viewing, listening,\n   etc. \
    \ For example, someone may have put up a sound file using a\n   format which cannot\
    \ be recognized by the software you have installed.\n   In these cases, that person\
    \ will often have included a pointer to the\n   exact tool necessary to recognize\
    \ their format, or convert the\n   format, and you can download, install, and\
    \ use this tool right away.\n   More information on file formats is provided throughout\
    \ the document.\n   Using the basic tools acquired to access the Internet, you\
    \ can begin\n   to add to your collection software tools, both for accessing the\n\
    \   information already on the Internet, and for creating your own\n   content.\
    \  After reading this document you will have the tools\n   necessary to find and\
    \ use this information.\n   Appendix B provides a list of Internet sites, where\
    \ communication\n   about the arts, and freely copyable software tools and art,\
    \ among\n   other things, can be found.\n   There are many people both like, and\
    \ unlike, yourself with whom you\n   can meet, communicate, and share ideas. \
    \ Some like to just talk, you\n   can listen if you like.  Others like to just\
    \ listen, so you and\n   others can talk.\n   There are also many forms that communication\
    \ can take, from private\n   electronic mail, to group video conferencing, to\
    \ moderated\n   newsgroups, to public bulletin boards.  See Section 5 for additional\n\
    \   information on Electronic Forums.\n"
- title: 3. What is the Internet?
  contents:
  - "3. What is the Internet?\n   As new users, the first question that probably comes\
    \ to mind is:\n   \"What is the Internet?\"  A good answer is: \"People, computers\
    \ and\n   information electronically linked around the world by a common\n   protocol\
    \ for communicating with each other.\"\n   The Advanced Research Projects Agency\
    \ (ARPA) was founded in the late\n   1960s.  Among its many projects, ARPA created\
    \ a network of computers\n   called the ARPANET.  As other networks were created,\
    \ most were\n   connected to the ARPANET, and the resulting network that\n   interconnected\
    \ many networks was named, \"The Internet\".  At last\n   count, this \"Information\
    \ Superhighway\" connects several million\n   computers and over 40 million users\
    \ from all over the world.\n   The Internet should not be confused with America\
    \ OnLine (AOL),\n   CompuServe, Prodigy, and other type service providers, which\
    \ may use\n   their own, often proprietary protocols and are sites unto themselves\n\
    \   but may also have connections to the Internet.  The Internet should\n   also\
    \ not be confused with the World Wide Web which is the topic of\n   the next section.\n"
- title: 3.1 What is the World Wide Web?
  contents:
  - "3.1 What is the World Wide Web?\n   The World Wide Web, generally referred to\
    \ as simply, The Web, is\n   comprised of a subset of the computers on the Internet.\n\
    \   You can visualize the World Wide Web as a giant magazine stand with a\n  \
    \ vast web of strings connecting various words pictures and ideas.\n   Like a\
    \ magazine rack, you may quickly select a chosen magazine, or\n   you may browse,\
    \ following the strings from magazine to magazine.\n   More formally, the Web\
    \ is vast multimedia \"document\" distributed\n   among a large number of the\
    \ computers on the Internet.\n   There is no central hierarchy that organizes\
    \ the Web.  Instead, the\n   information is distributed among many \"Web Sites\"\
    \ created and used by\n   the many people on the Internet.  Each Web Site is much\
    \ like a\n   magazine in that it has a Cover Page, called the Home Page, and other\n\
    \   pages of related information that can be connected in whatever way\n   the\
    \ author wishes.  This \"document\" is in a format called \"hypertext\"\n   which\
    \ allows information in the web to be linked by words or pictures\n   viewed on\
    \ the computer.\n   The Web is broken up into a large set of pages, called \"\
    Web Pages\",\n   of information connected by hypertext \"links\" which let you\
    \ click on\n   a highlighted word or picture to call up a page of related\n  \
    \ information.  This is what differentiates hyper-text from \"normal\"\n   text.\
    \  In \"normal\" text, each idea, sentence or paragraph is\n   connected in a\
    \ sequence or \"train of thought\", from beginning to end.\n   In hypertext however,\
    \ tracks of ideas branch out through \"Links\", so\n   that each idea may be connected\
    \ to many different \"trains of\n   thought\".  This ability to follow an idea\
    \ to many different\n   destinations allows you to read hypertext documents in\
    \ a way more\n   naturally resembling human thought.\n   For example, you might\
    \ create a \"Cool Music\" Web Page and place it on\n   a \"Web Server\", which\

  - "4. How Does the Internet Work?\n   While it is not necessary to understand how\
    \ the Internet works in\n   order to use it, a brief technical overview will introduce\
    \ you to\n   some concepts and terms that will be used in the sections ahead.\n\
    \   As we go into more detail here, we are assuming that you, the reader,\n  \
    \ have at least a passing familiarity with computers.  Section 6.2\n   provides\
    \ more information on computer hardware and software.\n   On one level, networks\
    \ are built out of wires, phone lines, and other\n   pieces of hardware, and the\
    \ Internet is indeed built of all these\n   things.  The essence of the Internet\
    \ however is built out of an idea\n   called the Internet Protocol.\n   There\
    \ are many different kinds of computers.  Most of them work by\n   encoding information\
    \ into ones and zeroes, which they can manipulate\n   at incredible speeds.  Unfortunately,\
    \ there are many different ways\n   of encoding information.  Computers that use\
    \ different methods can be\n   said to speak different languages.  In order for\
    \ computers to talk to\n   each other there must be a thing called a \"Communication\
    \ Protocol\"\n   that provides a set of procedures for talking and a common language\n\
    \   to use.\n   The Internet Protocol, or IP, is the Communication Protocol that\
    \ all\n   computers on the Internet must use and understand.  It allows\n   computers\
    \ to find each other, and to send packages, or \"packets\", of\n   information\
    \ back and forth.  Much like the Postal service reads your\n   country code, city\
    \ code, etc., but not the contents of your letter,\n   the Internet Protocol does\
    \ not care what is inside most of these\n   packets of information.  This is a\
    \ great thing because it means that\n   other, higher level protocols may transmit\
    \ any possible kind of\n   information simply by stuffing it into a packet and\
    \ handing it off to\n   the software responsible for speaking IP.\n   Another\
    \ important protocol upon which the Internet is built is the\n   Transmission\
    \ Control Protocol, or TCP.  IP by itself provides a way\n   of sending a message\
    \ to another computer, but no guarantee that it\n   will get through.  Since reliable\
    \ communication is a necessity, the\n   TCP protocol was invented which uses IP\
    \ to send packets and\n   guarantees their delivery by requiring the receiver\
    \ to acknowledge\n   the information received.  TCP and IP form the heart of a\
    \ group of\n   protocols aptly named the TCP/IP protocol suite.  This suite of\n\
    \   protocols provides most of the functionality of the Internet.\n   We will\
    \ be mentioning these protocols throughout the rest of the\n   document.  Information\
    \ on IP and other Internet Protocols can be\n   obtained through the resources\
    \ referenced in Section 10.\n"

  - "4.1  Internet Addresses\n   There are many things we would like to be able to\
    \ find on the net,\n   including people, information, and the computers themselves.\
    \  An\n   important part of IP and other protocols is the way they label things\n\
    \   so that the computers can find and identify them.  The U.S. Post\n   Office\
    \ finds people by their Postal Address, which is just a label\n   containing information\
    \ about who you are, and where you live.\n   Likewise, the various protocols of\
    \ the Internet have given computers,\n   people, and information, addresses which\
    \ can be used to find them.\n   The following sections will describe several different\
    \ kinds of\n   addresses.\n"
- title: 4.1.1 Computer Addresses and Hostnames
  contents:
  - "4.1.1 Computer Addresses and Hostnames\n   When speaking IP, computers locate\
    \ each other using a thing called\n   their IP Address.  Each computer on the\
    \ Internet must have a unique\n   IP Address.  Some programs allow or require\
    \ you to use the IP Address\n   directly, if so, it will appear as four groups\
    \ of numbers separated\n   by dots. (i.e., 123.123.123.123) Most of the time though,\
    \ you will\n   not need to worry about the actual IP Address number, because all\n\
    \   computers have a \"Host Name\" to which the number is mapped.\n   A computers\
    \ hostname also comes in parts, separated by dots.  The\n   first part is the\
    \ name of the machine, and the second part is the\n   name of the \"domain\" in\
    \ which that computer is registered.\n   For example, if I had a machine named\
    \ \"foo\" registered in the\n   commercial domain known as \"com\", my machine's\
    \ hostname would be\n   \"foo.com\".  When speaking out loud, this machine's address\
    \ would be\n   spoken as \"foo dot com\".\n   A domain is just an abstract category\
    \ to which machines and networks\n   may be registered into in order to organize\
    \ them.  Domains are\n   organized in a hierarchy of top level domains and their\
    \ subdomains.\n   Top Level Domains include,\n         .edu   for educational\
    \ institutions\n         .gov   for government sites\n         .com   for commercial\
    \ companies\n         .org   for other organizations\n         .net   for network\
    \ infrastructure sites\n         .us    for sites in the United States\n     \
    \    .ca    for sites in Canada\n         .nl    for sites in the Netherlands\n\
    \         .jp    for sites in Japan\n   to name a few.  Domain names may be further\
    \ subdivided by inserting\n   one or more subdomain names before the top level\
    \ domain, still\n   separating everything with dots.  For example, \"law.harvard.edu\"\
    , for\n   the Law School at Harvard University, and \"la.ca.us\" for computers\
    \ in\n   Los Angeles, California in the United States.\n   More information about\
    \ the Domain Naming System can be found in the\n   documents referenced in Section\
    \ 10.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.2  Addresses of People on the Internet\n   Every human being has a given\
    \ name, or full name with which we\n   address them.  When you begin to use a\
    \ computer, you will be\n   introduced to your \"username\".  Your username, sometimes\
    \ called your\n   user i.d., may be your initials, your last name and first initial,\n\
    \   your nickname, a number, or anything else that is just normal letter\n   or\
    \ number characters.  (Your username usually cannot contain\n   \"special\" characters\
    \ such as \"&\", or \"%\".)  Sometimes you get to\n   choose your own username,\
    \ and sometimes your service provider or\n   system administrator will choose\
    \ one for you.\n   Your username is used when you connect to other computers,\
    \ and to\n   identify you in electronic mail. Your electronic mail, or Email\n\
    \   Address, will consist of your username followed by the symbol \"@\",\n   followed\
    \ by your computers hostname.\n   So, for Joe Cool, who has the username \"jcool\"\
    , and gets his Internet\n   service from Dirigible Online, his email address might\
    \ be\n   \"jcool@dirigible.com\".  When spoken out loud, the \"@\" symbol is\n\
    \   pronounced simply \"at\" so this would typically be spoken as \"jcool at\n\
    \   dirigible dot com\".\n   Email is moved around on the Internet using the Simple\
    \ Mail Transfer\n   Protocol, SMTP, over IP.  Information on SMTP can be found\
    \ in the\n   documents listed in Section 10.\n"
- title: 4.1.3  Information Addresses, Uniform Resource Locators, or URLs.
  contents:
  - "4.1.3  Information Addresses, Uniform Resource Locators, or URLs.\n   In order\
    \ to retrieve information from the Internet, you need to be\n   able to find it\
    \ and know how to ask for it.  This is the job of the\n   Uniform Resource Locator,\
    \ or URL which functions as an address for\n   information.  Every file or document\
    \ intended to be accessible\n   through the Internet has a URL.\n   URLs (or simplified\
    \ versions of them) are now appearing frequently in\n   TV, billboard, and magazine\
    \ advertising as a company's Internet\n   Address; basically the hostname of their\
    \ web site.\n   In previous sections we've identified IP Addresses, hostnames\
    \ and\n   email addresses; a URL contains more information.  Not only does it\n\
    \   tell you what the information is, and where to find it, it also tells\n  \
    \ you precisely which protocol you need to use to retrieve it.\n   A URL is a\
    \ machine readable, and hence somewhat cryptic, text string,\n   in a form such\
    \ as \"http://www.something.com/location/filename.ext\".\n   This string can be\
    \ broken down into the following pieces.\n    http    is the name of the communications\
    \ protocol which can be used\n            to access the information.  In this\
    \ case, it identifies the\n            HyperText Transfer Protocol, which is used\
    \ in the World Wide\n            Web, and will be described later.  Other protocols\
    \ are\n            described in Section 4.3.\n      :     separates the protocol\
    \ from the hostname\n     //     indicates that what is to follow is the hostname\n\
    \   www.something.com  is the hostname of the computer on which the\n        \
    \    document resides.  In this case, the \"www\" indicates that\n           \
    \ it is a machine named for the fact that it is running a\n            World Wide\
    \ Web server.  \"something.com\" is the domain in\n            which that server\
    \ is registered.  Typically the \"something\"\n            part is the name of\
    \ the organization running the server.\n     /      separates the hostname from\
    \ directory on the machine in\n            which the information resides.\n  \
    \ location is the location of the information on the machine\n            something.com.\n\
    \   filename is the first part of the file name of the information you\n     \
    \       are retrieving.\n     .      a dot separates the filename from its extension\n\
    \     ext    the extension, or file \"type\" actually says a great deal\n    \
    \        about the file, how to handle it, and how to present it.\n   The URLs\
    \ you see will usually be simpler than this.  The people at\n   something.com\
    \ assume you are going to use a modern web browser to\n   access the information,\
    \ so they may leave off the protocol\n   information, \"http://\",  because this\
    \ is probably your web browsers\n   default protocol.  Also, if they configure\
    \ their server to have a\n   default homepage to display, they can leave off everything\
    \ after the\n   hostname part of the URL.  This puts it into the form that is\
    \ most\n   commonly seen, www.something.com.\n   URLs can specify any file and\
    \ most protocols.  In this example, the\n   URL is using the protocol for moving\
    \ HyperText, the HyperText\n   Transfer Protocol, HTTP, over IP.  More information\
    \ on HyperText and\n   HTTP can be found in the next section, and in the Resources\
    \ section.\n"
- title: 4.2 How Does the World Wide Web Work?
  contents:
  - "4.2 How Does the World Wide Web Work?\n   Web pages are computer files written\
    \ in a format called HTML, the\n   HyperText Markup Language.  HTML is the protocol\
    \ for putting specific\n   strings of letters and symbols (such as parentheses)\
    \ into an ordinary\n   text document which can specify that words link to other\
    \ pages, or be\n   viewed in a particular type font, or display images, or many\
    \ other\n   things when viewed with the appropriate software.  The appropriate\n\
    \   software would generally be a web browser.  More information about\n   software\
    \ tools is provided in Section 6.2.\n   HTML is simple enough that most people\
    \ can learn to use it, but rich\n   enough in possibility that there will always\
    \ be a thriving community\n   of people making web pages for others.\n   Links\
    \ within a hypertext documented are implemented using references\n   to the URL\
    \ of the information to be linked to.\n   In order to download information from\
    \ distant places in the web, your\n   computer will typically be using a protocol\
    \ called HTTP, the\n   HyperText Transfer Protocol.  HTTP was designed to allow\

    \ and any associated images, audio, video, etc.  The latest\n   version of the\

    \ a text-based mechanism for\n   communication with multiple participants.  IRC\
    \ is an interactive\n   forum set up in virtual rooms that you can move between,\
    \ and where\n   others can virtually \"hang out\".  Chat rooms can be used to\
    \ discuss\n   common ideas or topics, or as part of a collaborative process. \
    \ The\n   connection method used will be specific to each IRC site.  IRC sites\n\
    \   can be found using search tools, as outlined in Section 5.3.1.\n   Web chat\
    \ is like IRC but it is done via a web browser, and it is not\n   a text only\
    \ forum.  Section 6.2 provides more information on web\n   browser software.\n\
    \   Many webchat sites require the user to register before being able to\n   participate\
    \ in the activity.  If any additional software is needed\n   based on your particular\
    \ software and PC configuration the site will\n   point you in the right direction\

    \ may find that there are some abbreviations\n   used with which you are not familiar.\

  - "5.2.2  Multicasting\n   Multicasting is a technical term that means that you\
    \ can send pieces\n   of data, called \"packets\", to multiple sites simultaneously.\
    \  How big\n   a packet is depends on the protocols involved and it may range\
    \ from a\n   few bytes to a few thousand.  The usual way of moving information\n\
    \   around the Internet is by using unicast protocols, which send packets\n  \
    \ to one site at a time.\n   You can think of multicasting as the Internet's version\
    \ of\n   broadcasting.  A site that multicasts information is similar in many\n\
    \   ways to a television station that broadcasts its signal. The signal\n   originates\
    \ from one source, but it can reach everyone in the\n   station's signal area.\
    \  The signal takes up some of the finite\n   available bandwidth, and anyone\
    \ who has the right equipment can tune\n   it in. The information passes on by\
    \ those who don't want to catch the\n   signal or don't have the right equipment.\n"

- title: 5.3.1 Searching
  contents:
  - "5.3.1 Searching\n   One of the great challenges facing the Internet is how to\
    \ organize\n   the vast amounts of information in ways that allow most people\
    \ to\n   find what they want.  In theory, there may be a \"perfect\"\n   organization,\
    \ but in practice, we will never achieve it.  This means\n   that finding the\
    \ information you want on the net may require some\n   skill on your part.  Fortunately\
    \ there are many tools and strategies\n   that may be helpful.\n   One of the\
    \ all time great ideas for finding the information you want\n   is a thing called\
    \ a search engine.  A search engine is a computer\n   program usually living on\
    \ a remote computer that spends its time\n   downloading information from other\
    \ computers and building an index of\n   what lives where.  This behavior has\
    \ given them the nickname of Web\n   Crawlers.  What this means to you, is that\
    \ you can call up the Search\n   Engine's home page, and enter in a subject, name,\
    \ title, or random\n   string pattern, which is then used to search the engines\
    \ index for\n   stuff out on the net that seems related.  This can lead to both\
    \ a\n   large volume of information, and some rather startling discoveries of\n\
    \   information from unsuspected sources.\n   Some of the available Searchers\
    \ and Indices on the Internet include:\n   Yahoo      - Index of WWW sites, with\
    \ search capabilities\n                http://www.yahoo.com/\n   DejaNews   -\
    \ USENET (news groups) search engine\n                http://www.dejanews.com/\n\
    \   WebCrawler - http://query.webcrawler.com/\n   Lycos      - http://www.lycos.com/\n\
    \   AltaVista  - WWW and USENET search engine\n                http://www.altavista.digital.com/\n\
    \   Magellan   - Index of reviewed and rated Internet sites, with\n          \
    \      search capabilities\n                http://www.mckinley.com/\n   Yahoo,\
    \ for example, has a high-level category called \"Arts\", which\n   has a multitude\
    \ of subcategories below it, most of which have further\n   subdivision, each\
    \ of which can contain lists of lists.\n   For example, to find information on\
    \ Modern Dance, from a starting\n   point of http://www.yahoo.com/, you can follow\
    \ the links to\n   http://www.yahoo.com/Recreation/Dance/Modern/Groups or simply\
    \ type\n   \"Modern Dance\" into the search field and choose from a list of\n\
    \   selections returned.\n   On a typical attempt on March 25, 1997, Yahoo returned\
    \ 4 major\n   categories of Modern Dance, and offered 82 other links to related\n\
    \   pages around the web.  Statistics, however, can be changing by the\n   moment.\n\
    \   There are many other Searchers and Indices on the Internet, and a\n   good\
    \ way to find them, is to do a search for them in one of the\n   services above,\
    \ or others you encounter in your travels.  The\n   resources in Appendix B may\
    \ also be helpful.\n   After experimenting with the available search engines,\
    \ it quickly\n   becomes clear that searching on a broad category can result in\
    \ too\n   much information.  For example, a recent search at AltaVista for the\n\
    \   subject \"Rembrandt\" matched over 8500 individual items, including\n   information\
    \ on the famous artist (Rembrandt von Rijn (1606-1669)),\n   His Self-Portrait,\
    \ a hotel in Thailand (Rembrandt Hotel and Plaza,\n   Bangkok),  and a pizza restaurant\
    \ in California.  (The URLs for these\n   sites are listed under Rembrandt in\
    \ Appendix B.)\n   To be more particular in what you find, all of the available\
    \ search\n   engines allow you to do compound searches, in which multiple keywords\n\
    \   are used, possibly in combination with Boolean logic operators such\n   as\
    \ AND, OR, and NOT. For example, to focus in on Rembrandt the\n   artist, at the\
    \ exclusion of pizza cafes, try the following advanced\n   search in Magellan:\n\
    \   Rembrandt AND artist AND portrait NOT pizza\n   Note that the method of entering\
    \ search items differs slightly from\n   service to service.  When trying a new\
    \ service, check the available\n   help topic before searching.  And as with any\
    \ new skill, practice,\n   practice, practice!\n   Test of search scope:\n   \
    \  Lycos:     rembrandt.                       1837 relevant documents\n     Lycos:\

    \ and portrait          39379 results\n   You will notice, in the above statistics,\
    \ that the numbers for\n   Magellan are quite different from the others.  This\
    \ is because\n   different search engines may function differently.  When you\
    \ do a\n   this+that search on Magellan, it looks for all instances of This AND\n\
    \   all instances of That rather than the standard response of Only\n   documents\
    \ which contain both This AND That.  On almost all the sites\n   I have explored,\
    \ there is an explanation of how the search process\n   works on that site.  You\
    \ should read that explanation if you are\n   having trouble or need further information.\n\
    \   You will also begin to see patterns in the way people name, or file,\n   their\
    \ information, which will help you find more information.  Some\n   may list their\
    \ links to ART, while others list their links to\n   PAINTINGS.  Also many people\
    \ put links to related pages in their\n   pages, so one page you find that does\
    \ not have what you are looking\n   for, may have a pointer to another page that\
    \ does have what you are\n   looking for. Searching is an iterative process, keep\
    \ going from one\n   search key to another, and continue down multiple levels\
    \ to see what\n   is out there.  Its known as Exploring, or Surfing the Net, and\
    \ it is\n   a major part of the joy of the Internet.\n"

    \ a Hard\n   Drive, Memory, and a Video Monitor.  How much memory, how large a\n\
    \   hard drive, and how fabulous a monitor, will vary with your needs and\n  \
    \ experience.  To connect to an ISP you will usually also need a modem.\n   This\
    \ is simply an overview to familiarize you with some basic terms.\n   There are\
    \ many current magazines devoted to computer and Internet\n   related subjects\
    \ now available in most bookstores and magazine stands\n   which provide much\
    \ better and more timely information on computers,\n   operating systems, software,\
    \ and peripherals.\n   There are many types of computers available including Personal\n\
    \   Computers (PCs), Apple Macintosh Computers (Macs), and various Unix\n   based\
    \ Workstations.  The most affordable systems are generally PCs\n   and Macs.\n\
    \   You may also need to choose an Operating System (OS) for the machine\n   you\
    \ choose.  PCs can run a version of \"DOS\", anything from Microsoft\n   (Windows,\
    \ NT, Windows95, etc.), or a version of Unix (BSDI, FreeBSD,\n   Linux, etc.)\
    \ Macs can run the common Mac Windows, or Apples version\n   of Unix.  Workstations\
    \ generally run a Unix derived OS, but there are\n   also quite a few machines\
    \ available which run their own proprietary\n   OS.\n   Each type of system has\
    \ its features, functions, and drawbacks, as\n   well as its proponents and opponents.\
    \  Each system has different\n   costs associated with it.  You will need to understand\
    \ much of this\n   before you are ready to buy your first computer.  Much of the\
    \ free\n   software available on the Internet, for example, was written for the\n\
    \   Unix operating system because that has been the main OS of the\n   Internet\
    \ for many years.  That, of course, doesn't mean there isn't\n   alot of free\
    \ software available for other OSs, Windows software, for\n   example, is becoming\
    \ quite popular.  The system of choice for most\n   musicians is the Mac because\
    \ of the variety and quality of the music\n   software available for them. Windows\
    \ users will need a pc to run\n   their software.  Now, actually, there are many\
    \ operating systems\n   available for personal computers.\n   Common operating\
    \ systems come in two basic types; single tasking and\n   multi-tasking.  This\
    \ is a reference to how many different things or\n   \"tasks\" the computer \"\
    seems\" to be doing at once.  The earliest\n   computers were single tasking.\
    \  They did only one thing at a time,\n   and could be used by only one person\
    \ at a time.  DOS is a modern\n   example of a single tasking operating system.\
    \  Since people rarely do\n   more than a few things every second, this often\
    \ left the computer\n   simply waiting around for the next keystroke.\n   Even\
    \ back then, computers could do all the work needed to listen to a\n   human in\
    \ a few milliseconds every second, so time-slicing was\n   invented to get more\
    \ use out of computers.\n   A time-slicing operating system is said to be Multi-tasking.\
    \ It\n   executes programs in little slices of time, typically shorter than 25\n\
    \   milliseconds (or 1/40 of a second) and switches to another task for\n   each\
    \ new slice.  If you remember that most video runs at 25 or 30\n   discrete frames\
    \ per second, and yet humans perceive it as continuous,\n   you can see how time-slicing\
    \ can provide a convincing illusion of\n   doing many things at the same time.\n\
    \   Multi-tasking operating systems have the option of being set up as\n   single-user\
    \ or Multi-user machines Windows 95 and the MacOS are\n   modern examples of multi-tasking\
    \ operating systems that were designed\n   to be used by a single user most of\
    \ the time.  Other operating\n   systems, such as UNIX, VMS, NT, and others are\
    \ more prepared to be\n   set up as multiuser machines.  Multiuser machines are\
    \ typically\n   connected to a network, or a network of terminals, so that more\
    \ than\n   one person can use the processor and other peripherals at the same\n\
    \   time.\n   Some operating systems can also take advantage of Parallel Processing\n\
    \   hardware that actually does more than one thing at a time.  However\n   as\
    \ of this writing, this hardware is somewhat rare and expensive, so\n   we won't\
    \ go into the details here.\n   Different OSs also have different File Systems.\
    \  The File System is\n   the way in which your programs and other computer files\
    \ are stored\n   and displayed.  Different Operating Systems also have different\
    \ \"User\n   Interface\"s.  The User Interface is the way in which you interact\n\
    \   with the computers OS.  Some use \"Text\" interfaces, which require the\n\
    \   user to type all commands using a keyboard.  Others use a \"Graphical\"\n\
    \   user interface, which provides graphical images of buttons and icons\n   which\
    \ the user \"clicks\" on to start programs and perform save and\n   delete functions\
    \ among other things.\n   In order for the software to run on the computer, the\
    \ software must\n   be written specifically for the operating system.  Just like\
    \ Internet\n   traffic must use the Internet Protocol, software must speak the\
    \ OS\n   language of the computer on which it wants to run.  Translation\n   programs\
    \ exist, but there are still problems.\n   One of the problems is with file\"\
    names\".  The DOS Operating System,\n   for example, supports names that consist\
    \ of an 8-character filename,\n   and a 3-character \"extension\", separated by\
    \ a \".\".  For example\n   \"foo.txt\", and \"myprog.exe\" are valid DOS filenames,\
    \ but sadly,\n   \"foo.html\" is not.  This means that HTML files on a dos system\
    \ must\n   use the extension \".htm\" rather than the \".html\" extension used\
    \ on\n   many other systems.  This problem also affects many other common\n  \
    \ extensions such as \".jpeg\", \".mpeg\" and others.\n   A filename's extension\
    \ is very important in that it tells not only\n   you, but your software, the\
    \ kind of file it is, and what it needs in\n   order to be understood.  For example,\
    \ when your web browser\n   encounters a file with a .html or .htm extension,\
    \ it will assume it\n   is hypertext, and will know how to display it and follow\
    \ its links.\n   When it gets a .txt file, it knows to display it, and that it\
    \ will\n   have no links.  Your browser can also be configured to understand\n\
    \   other file formats which can be made to be displayed with the\n   browser,\
    \ or another program, or saved to disk, etc.  For example, you\n   might configure\
    \ your browser to start up Word when it encounters a\n   .doc file.\n   File extensions\
    \ indicate file format.  Just as there are different\n   file extensions for different\
    \ text file formats, there are different\n   extensions for different graphic\
    \ file formats.  That goes for sound\n   file formats, video file formats, data\
    \ base files, and others.\n   Different software understands different file formats\
    \ and will create\n   and display only those formats it understands.  For this\
    \ reason,\n   software which translates a file from one format to another is often\n\
    \   necessary.\n   For example, if you create a file with Microsoft Word you will\n\
    \   usually save it in Word's native format as a \".doc\" file. You can\n   also\
    \ choose the \"save as\" option to save it as plain text in the .txt\n   file\
    \ format.  Although some format information will be lost in the\n   translation,\
    \ words and numbers should remain unchanged.  If you\n   wanted to give others\
    \ access to the file, and you couldn't assume\n   that they all have Word, you\
    \ would want to present it in .txt format.\n   Note that a .txt file is also easily\
    \ formatted into .html.\n   File formats and extensions are discussed throughout\
    \ the following\n   sections.\n   After you've resolved to some extent, what it\
    \ is you want to do, and\n   what hardware and OS you'll need, there are a great\
    \ deal of software\n   packages available to help you with all sorts of things\
    \ on the\n   computer.\n   Software designed to make your life easier by using\
    \ your computer,\n   include dictionaries and other reference materials, accounting,\n\
    \   bookkeeping desktop publishing and other business needs software, as\n   well\
    \ as landscape and architectural planning software, health and\n   nutrition software,\
    \ educational and entertainment software, and much,\n   much more.  Your computer\
    \ need not only be your link to the world,\n   but also a major organizational\
    \ tool in your life.\n   For accessing the Internet, you'll need communication\
    \ software.\n   There are a few different pieces to this part of the puzzle. \
    \ There\n   is the software which communicates between the operating system and\n\
    \   the modem or network card, there's the software which speaks IP and\n   allows\
    \ communication over the Internet, and there's the software\n   which you use\
    \ which is called the \"user interface\", or application\n   program.  For accessing\
    \ the web, your application will be a \"web\n   browser\".\n   Web browsers are\
    \ available in stores that sell software packages, and\n   are also available\
    \ free on the Internet.  Since you would not be able\n   to reference the online\
    \ material without a browser, and since most\n   available periodicals will be\
    \ likely to focus on commercial browsers,\n   the Resources section provides a\
    \ pointer to a free browser available\n   by mail for the cost of postage, or\
    \ over the Internet using the File\n   Transfer Protocol, FTP.\n   Ftp software\
    \ is available both free and commercially.  Other Internet\n   communication software,\
    \ referenced throughout this document, are\n   email, news, gopher, and telnet\
    \ among others.\n   With any system, you should ensure that it contains the software\
    \ and\n   hardware necessary to maintain both itself and your data.  While\n \
    \  computer data is not particularly fragile, it is still sometimes lost\n   due\
    \ to hardware or software problems or simple human error.  For this\n   reason\
    \ it is considered important to \"back up\" your system by making\n   extra copies\
    \ of important data.  While simply copying data onto\n   floppy disks could work,\
    \ the small storage size of the disks makes it\n   both time consuming and prone\
    \ to human error.  Many large capacity\n   disk and tape drives are available\
    \ with special software specifically\n   for doing backups.  It is highly recommended\
    \ that you purchase a\n   backup solution along with your computer.\n   It is\
    \ also important to protect your data from being damaged by\n   computer viruses.\
    \  When you connect to the net and move data back and\n   forth, it is possible\
    \ that there can be a small piece of software\n   called a \"virus\" that could\
    \ hide in some of the data and infect your\n   system, possibly then using your\
    \ system to infect other machines that\n   you connect to.  These viruses are\
    \ often created by misguided people\n   as a sort of computer prank, and can accidentally\
    \ or maliciously\n   damage your data.  Fortunately it is possible to obtain virus\n\
    \   checking software that can regularly scan your system to see if it\n   has\
    \ been infected.  This software is important whether you are\n   downloading information\
    \ from the net, or using other peoples floppy\n   disks.  See Section 8.2 for\
    \ more information on viruses.\n   Determining your ideal hardware and software\
    \ configuration will take\n   some time and patience.  You need an understanding\
    \ of what you want\n   to do, and how, and whether you wish to simply view, or\
    \ create.\n   You'll also want to know the limitations and expandability potential\n\
    \   of the system, so you can determine if it will have a useful\n   lifespan.\
    \  If the machine cannot grow for the foreseeable few years,\n   it will become\
    \ obsolete before its given you its fullest value.\n"

  - "7.  Creating Content\n   As the hardware and software of the net becomes cheaper\
    \ and better\n   understood, the technology itself will become less important\
    \ than the\n   content which lives on the net.  Many of the rewards of the Internet\n\
    \   will go to the people who create such content.\n   There are different ways\
    \ to add content to the Internet.  One may\n   start with pre-existing content,\
    \ such as paintings or stories, and\n   find a place for it, or one may create\
    \ content specifically for the\n   computer such as web pages, graphics, video\
    \ and audio files, etc.\n   Let us for the moment assume that you have already\
    \ created something\n   which you would like to make available on the net.  There\
    \ are many\n   ways in which you could do this.  You could deal with agencies\
    \ who\n   provide this service professionally, find friends or others willing\n\
    \   to do it for free or barter, or get yourself on the net in some\n   fashion,\
    \ learn, and create a place for it yourself.\n   If you chose to do it yourself,\
    \ you will need your own computer and\n   some form of Internet access from an\
    \ Internet Service Provider (ISP)\n   or Web Space Provider (WSP).\n   Once you\
    \ have a place to put your content, you will need to\n   understand a little more\
    \ about file formats.  Images may have to be\n   digitized, audio may have to\
    \ be recorded into computer files, etc.\n   While hardware, such as image scanners,\
    \ are readily available, there\n   are also many other options available.  For\
    \ example, most print, or\n   copy shops today can do high quality image scans\
    \ and some photolabs\n   now provide photos-on-disk as one of their services.\n\
    \   If you are placing your content on the Web, a web page must be\n   created\
    \ for it in the form of an HTML document.  While this is easy\n   enough to do\
    \ yourself, many WSPs also offer this service, and there\n   are also independent\
    \ web page designers who may be able to do a\n   better job.\n   Creating online\
    \ content involves moving your art into an electronic\n   form and then perhaps,\
    \ re-formatting it for the Internet.  For some\n   art forms, the initial electronic\
    \ step is fairly painless: typing a\n   short story, poem, novel, or other text\
    \ into HTML is fairly\n   straight forward.  Moving a computer graphic to the\
    \ Internet may\n   require a conversion program to make it useful to others. \
    \ Performing\n   arts, sculpture, and other pieces may be more difficult to capture\
    \ on\n   a computer disk, and may require more work and creative thinking.\n \
    \  Much of the information needed to help you think creatively about\n   publicizing\
    \ your work online is available in classes, books, local\n   Internet cafes, and\
    \ on the Internet itself.  Many Internet magazines\n   are available for subscriptions\
    \ or individual issues can help get you\n   started.  Most new bookstores and,\
    \ to some extent, used bookstores\n   provide numerous volumes of Internet information.\
    \  However, even the\n   most recently published books may contain outdated information.\
    \  The\n   latest 'standards' can be obtained directly from the Internet\n   Engineering\
    \ Task Force, or IETF, at http://www.ietf.org/.  The\n   document you are reading\
    \ now is a product of that organization.  The\n   documents of the IETF are collected\
    \ and maintained on anonymous ftp\n   sites, as well as in the web.  These sites\
    \ are referenced in the\n   Resources section, and Appendix B.\n   A really good\
    \ way to learn how to write html documents is to look at\n   the source code of\
    \ html files already available.  Just use your\n   browser to look for pages you\
    \ like, and then use your browsers \"view\n   source\" feature to see how it was\
    \ done.\n   If however, you learn better by having someone teach you, you may\
    \ be\n   interested in taking a HTML or Internet Introduction course at a\n  \
    \ local college.  Most larger metropolitan area schools provide classes\n   for\
    \ the basics, which can also expose you to other artists.  Make\n   sure you read\
    \ the course description; some courses may only cover\n   accessing the Internet\
    \ while you may want to actually be creating\n   documents.  If no colleges in\
    \ your area offer classes, contact the\n   computer science department or the\
    \ continuing education office and\n   suggest a topic.  If the school can obtain\
    \ enough support, they may\n   offer a class the following semester.\n   Artists\
    \ in smaller communities may need to rely more heavily upon\n   online sources\
    \ of information.  Appendix B provides some useful sites\n   to get you started.\n"

  - "7.2 About File Formats\n   As described in Section 6.2, there are many file formats\
    \ available on\n   the Internet.  You'll need to understand a bit more about the\
    \ formats\n   you'll want to present, in order to create them for others to see.\n\
    \   Some formats are called Public Domain, and are freely copyable, and\n   the\
    \ software tools used to create this content is available for you\n   and others\
    \ to download off the net.  Other formats are called\n   \"proprietary\", and\

    \ the vendor who created it, or their\n   authorized reseller.\n   Some formats,\
    \ and their associated formatting tools, come along with\n   other software packages.\

  - "7.3 Creating Text and Hypertext Documents\n   Text files are stored on a computer\

    \ Interchange\", which\n   substitutes a distinct number for each character of\
    \ text, and stores\n   the result in a file.  Text files are often given the file\
    \ extension\n   \".txt\".\n   Text files can be created in many ways.  The two\
    \ most common types of\n   programs used are called \"text editors\" and \"word\

- title: 7.4.1  Bitmap Image Formats
  contents:
  - "7.4.1  Bitmap Image Formats\n   Pictures may be stored on computers in many different\
    \ ways.  One of\n   the most common, is a simple bitmap consisting of a list of\
    \ pixel\n   colors, and header information describing how to map this list of\n\
    \   pixels back into the image.  Bitmap formats are .bmp in windows, and\n   Bitmap\
    \ images may be created by scanning in existing images, or by\n   creating images\
    \ directly on the computer, using programs such as\n   Adobe Photoshop, Corel\
    \ Photo Paint, Windows Paintbrush, and many\n   others available both freely and\
    \ commercially.\n   A scanner works very much like a copy machine, or fax machine,\
    \ in\n   that it \"scans\" your artwork or text and \"encodes\" it into a machine\n\
    \   readable format of numbers and formulas.  A scanner is a hardware\n   tool,\
    \ and usually comes with at least some of the software you need\n   to use it.\
    \  Generally it will connect to your computer and you will\n   either place your\
    \ work on it, or run the scanner slowly over your\n   work, depending on the type\
    \ of scanner you select.  Scanners are only\n   available commercially, and come\
    \ in a variety of sizes and styles\n   with a variety of features and prices.\
    \  As with all computer tools,\n   understanding what you want to accomplish will\
    \ help you decide what\n   you need to purchase.\n   Since it can take a lot of\
    \ data to encode an image, there are many\n   different kinds of file formats\
    \ that contain compressed versions of\n   the file data.  These formats vary greatly\
    \ in how they compress the\n   data.  Two of the most popular compressed image\
    \ formats on the net\n   are .gif and .jpg.\n   GIF, short for Graphic Image Format,\
    \ compresses an image by reducing\n   the number of colors in the palette the\
    \ image is reconstructed from,\n   allowing them to shrink down the size of the\
    \ color specification for\n   each pixel.  Even if you only save a few bits per\
    \ pixel, there are\n   typically enough pixels that the savings are significant.\
    \  Under\n   extreme amounts of compression, images start to look like childrens\n\
    \   coloring books, but it is possible to get great looking images with\n   moderate\
    \ amounts.  GIF files typically use the extension \".gif\".\n   The JPEG format\
    \ uses complex mathematics to approximate the whole\n   image.  Under extreme\
    \ amounts of compression, images start to look\n   like bizarre cubist interpretations\
    \ of the original image, but\n   because everything about the image is compressed,\
    \ it is still\n   possible to get dramatic reductions in file size while retaining\n\
    \   acceptable image quality.  JPEG files typically use the extensions\n   \"\
    .jpeg\" or \".jpg\"\n   Both of these formats are what is known as \"lossy\" compression\n\
    \   because they actually lose information from the original image, thus\n   degrading\
    \ (hopefully by a negligible amount) the image quality.\n   There are also \"\
    lossless\" compression schemes that offer smaller\n   reductions in file size,\
    \ but allow perfect reconstruction of the\n   image.\n"
- title: 7.4.2  Vector Image Formats
  contents:
  - "7.4.2  Vector Image Formats\n   Another way images may be stored is in \"vector\"\
    \ format.  This format\n   is useful because of one of the techniques for creating\
    \ images on a\n   computer.  There are programs that allow you to create images\
    \ by\n   creating shapes like circles and polygons, and specifying colors for\n\
    \   them.  If the entire image is constructed this way, it is possible to\n  \
    \ encode the list of information describing each polygon using only a\n   fraction\
    \ of the information it would take to describe each pixel.\n   Vector images also\
    \ have the wonderful quality that they may be scaled\n   without loss of image\
    \ quality.  For example, if you were to enlarge a\n   bitmap image of a circle\
    \ large enough to see individual pixels, you\n   will find that pixels are actually\
    \ square dots, and if enlarged\n   enough, the circle will have very jagged edges.\
    \  However if you\n   enlarge a vector image of a circle, it remains perfect down\
    \ to the\n   limit of resolution of the screen or printer, because it is stored\
    \ as\n   the mathematical representation of a circle which is independent of\n\
    \   scale.\n   For this reason, much commercial art and layout is often done in\n\
    \   vector formats.\n   Vector formats may be created using many commercially\
    \ available\n   software packages, and many freely copyable conversion tools are\
    \ also\n   available.\n"
- title: 7.4.3  Video Formats
  contents:
  - "7.4.3  Video Formats\n   Images received by the retina of the eye persist for\
    \ a short period\n   of time, and then fade.  A sequence of images or \"frames\"\
    , with small\n   changes, sufficiently close together, will give the illusion\
    \ of a\n   moving picture.  How much of the picture changes between one image\n\
    \   and the next affects how smoothly or jerkily the movement will\n   appear.\
    \  Frame rates of 10 per second and above are enough to give a\n   reasonably\
    \ realistic rendition of natural scenes.  In fact, the way\n   that motion is\
    \ perceived by the human brain means that less detail is\n   required in fast\
    \ moving segments of a picture.\n   Video on your television, or Video Cassette\
    \ Recorder (VCR), is\n   formatted quite differently from video formatted for\
    \ viewing,\n   storage, and transmission over the Internet.  Disk space and\n\

  - "7.5  Music and Sound\n   The World Wide Web supports audio data as well as visual\
    \ data.  The\n   most obvious way to send audio across the net would be to use\
    \ digital\n   audio like that used for the Compact Disc or \"CD\".  However, CD\n\
    \   format digital audio requires 44,100 16 bit words per second for a\n   mono\
    \ signal, and twice that for a stereo signal.  While there are\n   many places\
    \ where one can find digital audio in Windows \".wav\", or\n   the Macintosh \"\
    .au\" format, these files typically take a very long\n   time to download even\
    \ a few seconds of audio.  The size of these\n   formats makes them too inefficient\
    \ for widespread use on the net\n   today.\n   It is however possible to do \"\
    useful\" audio over the net. The\n   emerging \"de facto\" standard seems to be\
    \ _RealAudio_, based on the\n   freely distributable server/player application,\
    \ _RealAudio_ version\n   2.0, developed by the Seattle based company Progressive\
    \ Networks.\n   First released in 1995, RealAudio allows useable digital audio\
    \ in\n   realtime over a 28.8 kB line, and has already been put into service\n\
    \   on the home pages of most major record companies as well as in many\n   niche\
    \ applications.  In addition, RealAudio provides a \"Voice mode\"\n   optimized\
    \ for understandable speech transmission over a 14.4kB line.\n   Unfortunately\
    \ the quality of _RealAudio_ leaves much to be desired.\n   In particular, the\
    \ sample rate in Music Mode is only 8Khz (as\n   compared to CD quality 44.1 Khz),\
    \ meaning that all high frequencies\n   above 4khz are simply missing.  The resulting\
    \ audio is still pleasing\n   to listen to, but sounds very dull and dark.\n \
    \  More information about RealAudio can be found at www.RealAudio.com.\n   Clearly\
    \ Digital Audio is the way of the future, but until more\n   bandwidth is available\
    \ to the average person, it may not be the way\n   of the present.  Fortunately,\
    \ at least in the area of music, there is\n   an interesting alternative.\n  \
    \ MIDI (the Musical Instrument Digital Interface), as developed for\n   electronic\
    \ musical instruments (keyboards, samplers, drum machines,\n   etc.) works well\
    \ for certain kinds of music over the net.  It\n   involves sending no sound sources\
    \ at all, just the description of the\n   music -- kind of like the score, without\
    \ the instruments.  If the\n   receiver has the right instruments on their computer\
    \ (such as the\n   sounds defined in the General Midi soundset found on many\n\
    \   soundcards), they can play back the musical score.\n   The big disadvantage\
    \ to using MIDI is that other than the limited\n   selection of sounds in the\
    \ General Midi set, it is extremely\n   difficult to make sure the music sounds\
    \ more than approximately like\n   the original.  And there is no way to handle\
    \ non-MIDI instruments\n   such as guitar or voice, so it is useless to hear the\
    \ new song by\n   your favorite rock and roll band.\n   The big advantage to MIDI\
    \ is how fast it works over slow net\n   connections.  For example, five minutes\
    \ of music, fits in a mere 30k\n   file, and usually will not take more than a\
    \ few seconds even on the\n   slowest of dialup connections!  This makes it ideal\
    \ for applications\n   such as networked games, or music to go along with a web\
    \ page.\n   There are many ways of embedding MIDI files into HTML documents, for\n\
    \   Internet distribution.\n   Anyone who wants to add MIDI to a page can choose\
    \ to use existing\n   public access MIDI file banks, of which there are many,\
    \ or to produce\n   new MIDI themselves.\n   Crescendo is one package available\
    \ for embedding MIDI files in HTML\n   http://www.liveupdate.com Crescendo works\
    \ for both Macintosh and\n   Windows.\n   Helpful Links: Publicly Available Audio\

    \   Formerly, debate on musical form and structure occurred in the pages\n   of\
    \ journals, referring usually to music examples in terms of its\n   visual notation.\
    \  This notation requires a certain degree of training\n   to decode, effectively\
    \ restricting the potential readership to those\n   with this professional training.\
    \  With sound examples embedded\n   directly in the text, at least the aural effect\
    \ of the music comes\n   across, even to those unable to read the notation accurately.\
    \  This\n   shift is appropriate to the newer trends in music scholarship, which\n\
    \   talk about music in terms of its social and cultural context, instead\n  \

    , which asks: \"when and where is\n   it appropriate to allow people to own information?\"\
    \n   Copyright, Trademark, and Patent law are some of society's responses\n  \
    \ to earlier versions of this question.  They support the idea of\n   ownership\
    \ of ideas, or information, which can be used to assist the\n   creators of the\
    \ information in making a living from its creation.\n   This is good for society.\n\
    \   It is also good for society for information to flow freely.  Our\n   technology,\
    \ and even our society are built on a growing pool of\n   shared information.\
    \  If we restrict the flow of information into that\n   pool, then we restrict\
    \ the rate at which society grows and becomes\n   wiser.\n   These two opposing\
    \ drives have been highlighted by our newfound\n   ability to distill many different\

    \ sites.  The short version is that if a Domain\n   Name is registered in good\
    \ faith, \"innocent registrations\", the\n   register can often keep the name,\
    \ however, if the domain name is\n   being used by a competitor, or to \"force\
    \ the trademark owner to pay a\n   sum of money to acquire the name\", the courts\
    \ will generally not\n   allow the register to keep the name, or profit from it.\n\
    \   Trademark Dilution occurs when unauthorized use of a mark on\n   dissimilar\
    \ products or for dissimilar services causes the mark to\n   cease functioning\
    \ as a unique identifier, or becomes consciously or\n   unconsciously linked with\
    \ poor quality goods or services.  The\n   Federal Trademark Dilution Act covers\

- title: 8.6 Netiquette
  contents:
  - "8.6 Netiquette\n   Like any community, the Internet has a code of conduct, for\
    \ which the\n   users have created the term \"Netiquette\".  Much of it will probably\n\
    \   seem like common sense, but since the Internet spans many cultures'\n   ideas\
    \ of \"common sense\", its worth paying attention.  Remember, when\n   you put\
    \ something onto the Internet, you're publishing it in front of\n   a very large\
    \ audience.\n   What follows is a few short ideas to start out with.  If you wish\
    \ to\n   behave well on the Internet, you really should read:\n   FYI 28 \"Netiquette\
    \ Guidelines\", (Also RFC 1855), October 1995.\n   available at ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1855.txt\n\
    \   First of all, most forums have their own guidelines posted near the\n   door\
    \ for new arrivals.  For Usenet News, for example, read\n   news.announce.newusers.\
    \  It never hurts to keep silent until you know\n   your audience better.  Once\
    \ you join a forum, see how others behave\n   before making too much of an impression.\
    \  Also, try not to jump to\n   conclusions about others.  Internet media conveys\
    \ attitudes and\n   emotions differently than face-to-face, or even telephone\n\
    \   communication.  You are also dealing with more cultural diversity on\n   the\
    \ Internet than you are likely familiar with.  Realize that many\n   things have\
    \ very different meanings in other cultures than they might\n   in yours.  Try\
    \ not to take things too personally.  Avoid attributing\n   to malice what might\
    \ be adequately explained by ignorance.  And hope\n   others will do the same.\n"

    \ be able to do for you to make\n   your site more secure.  Foremost, packet filtering\
    \ on the router that\n   connects you to the Internet.  You will want to consider\
    \ IP filters\n   to allow specific types of traffic (web, ftp, mail, etc.) to\
    \ certain\n   machines (the mailhost, the web server, etc.) and no others.  Other\n\

    \ your filters.  Discuss your concerns and questions\n   with your provider -\
    \ the company may have standards or tools they can\n   recommend.\n"
- title: 11.1.2. Make sure your systems are up to date.
  contents:
  - "11.1.2. Make sure your systems are up to date.\n   A significant number of incidents\

    \ depository for software\n   patches designed by concerned net.citizens, CERT's\
    \ engineers, and by\n   the vendors themselves.\n"
- title: 11.1.3. Use the tools available.
  contents:
  - "11.1.3. Use the tools available.\n   Consider recording MD5 checksums on read-only\
    \ media (the MD5-digest\n   algorithm determines an electronic \"fingerprint\"\
    \ for files to\n   indicate their uniqueness -comparing more recent checksums\
    \ to older\n   ones can alert you to changes in important system files), installing\n\
    \   tripwire on your systems (notes size and MD5 checksum changes, among\n   other\
    \ sanity checks), and periodically testing the integrity of your\n   machines\
    \ with programs an intruder might use, like SATAN and crack.\n   [Details on MD5\
    \ are contained in RFC 1321.]\n   Most files and fixes go through the basics before\
    \ leaving you to\n   figure things out on your own, but security can be a complicated\n\
    \   issue, both technically and morally.  When good security is\n   implemented,\
    \ no one really notices.  Unfortunately, no one notices\n   when it's not taken\
    \ care of either.  That is until the system\n   crashes, your data gets corrupted,\
    \ or you get a phone call from an\n   irate company whose site was cracked from\

    \        Communities\n   The commonplace insight about the web as a new distribution\
    \ channel\n   for cultural products is that it effaces the traditional border\n\
    \   between producer and consumer.  Publishers exploit two-way\n   interactivity\
    \ by re-designing the editorial mix to include reader\n   response.  What follows\
    \ are some examples of the way creative artists\n   attempt to design structures\
    \ flexible enough for significant viewer\n   input.\n   RENGA (http://renga.ntticc.or.jp)\
    \ - An inspired transposition of a\n      traditional collaborative writing practice\
    \ into the realm of\n      digital media supported by the NTT InterCommunication\
    \ Centre in\n      Tokyo.  Renga means linked-image or linked-poem, and draws\
    \ on the\n      Japanese tradition of collaboration which effaces the unique\n\
    \      notion of original author.\n   PING (http://www.artcom.de/ping/mapper)\
    \ - by Art+Com, a Berlin\n      based media centre and thinktank.  Art+Com is\
    \ a leader in\n      producing high-end net visualization projects.  Ping lets\
    \ the\n      browser add a link, which then becomes a part of the ongoing\n  \
    \    visual structure.  It is similar, in this sense, to the Toronto\n      Centre\
    \ for Landscape Architecture's OASIS site.\n   Art+Com's T-Vision project (http://www.artcom.de/projects/terra)\n\
    \      which uses satellites and networked VR computers to permit an\n      astonishing\
    \ fly-in to earth from space: acclaimed as one of the\n      most imaginative\
    \ realizations of the potential of networked\n      computing.\n   OASIS(Image)INTERNET-DRAFT\
    \ Toronto Centre for Landscape\n      Architecture's OASIS site requires a specialized\
    \ browser, but from\n      a standard Netscape connection, you can view stills\
    \ that give a\n      sense of the beautiful images produced by the collaborative\n\
    \      \"design process\".  It is introduced by its designers as follows:\n  \
    \    Oasis is a shared 3-Dimensional navigational environment for the\n      world\
    \ wide web.  This virtual landscape allows one to bury their\n      own information\
    \ links throughout the terrain or to discover and\n      connect to new information\
    \ left by others.\n   TechnoSphere (http://www.lond-inst.ac.uk/TechnoSphere/)\n\
    \   Is TechnoSphere a Game?\n      Yes and no. It's an experiment on a global\
    \ scale, a chance to\n      develop complex artificial life on digital networks.\
    \  TechnoSphere\n      is interactive like a game, but transgresses the linear\
    \ boundaries\n      of branching and hierarchical games narrative to enable freer\n\
    \      movement.  TechnoSphere is designed to encourage a non-linear\n      experiential\
    \ exploration.\n   Body Missing (http://yorku.ca/BodyMissing/index.html)\n   \
    \   Toronto artist Vera Frenkel created this richly evocative site on\n      the\
    \ disappearance of art and memory as an extension of her Transit\n      Bar installation.\
    \  It is conceived as a site open to new\n      'reconstructions' of the artworks\
    \ confiscated during the Third\n      Reich.  First opened to the public as part\
    \ of the ISEA95\n      exhibition in Montreal, it has since earned widespread\
    \ critical\n      comment and praise.\n   Molecular Clinic 1.0\n   (http://sc_web.cnds.canon.co.jp/molecular_clinic/artlab_bionet)\n\
    \      Molecular Clinic 1.0 ' is an art project realized through a\n      collaboration\
    \ between ARTLAB and Seiko Mikami, and is one of the\n      most elaborate custom\
    \ designed art projects yet created for the\n      Web.  During their initial\
    \ visit users should download the\n      MOLECULAR ENGINE VIEWER, which is a type\
    \ of molecular laboratory\n      for their computer.  What they will see on the\
    \ web site after this\n      initial download is a virtual space containing a\
    \ three dimensional\n      computer generated Spider and Monolith object.  The\
    \ user will be\n      able to navigate through and into this virtual space and\
    \ can zoom\n      into the spider all the way to the molecular level.\n   File\
    \ Room (http://fileroom.aaup.uic.edu/FILEROOM.html) -\n      Cumulative database\
    \ info on Censorship, hosted in Chicago but\n      conceived by Spanish artist\
    \ Antoni Muntadas.\n   Idea Futures  (http://if.arc.ab.ca/~jamesm/IF/IF.html)\
    \ -\n      Winner of the grand prize at the 1995 Ars Electronica competition\n\
    \      for Web Sites, Idea Futures is a stock market of ideas, based on\n    \
    \  the theories of mathematical economist Robin Hanson.  The 'truth'\n      of\
    \ any claim is assigned a weight calculated by the amount of\n      virtual cash\
    \ which members of the exchange are willing to bet.\n      The scheme leads might\
    \ lead toward a radical democratization of\n      academic discourse, but just\
    \ as easily, toward the trivialization\n      of thought.  See the following for\
    \ a philosophical critique of the\n      system. (http://merzbau.citi.doc.ca/~henry/Matrix/Erewhon.html)\n\
    \   Firefly (http://www.agents-inc.com/) also a prize winner at Ars\n      Electronica\
    \ in 1995, Firefly is an prototypical example of what\n      enthusiasts call\
    \ a \"personal music recommendation agent\", which\n      makes suggestions for\
    \ what you might like to listen to, based on a\n      stored profile of your own\
    \ likes and dislikes, and the evolving\n      ratings submitted to the system\
    \ by other members.  Worth visiting,\n      if only to understand what all the\
    \ fashionable hype about\n      'intelligent agents' is all about; skeptics should\
    \ know that even\n      the promoters of these services admit the circularity\
    \ of their\n      systems: they're capable of reinforcing existing taste, but\
    \ little\n      else.\n"
