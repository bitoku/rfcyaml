  - "SOME THOUGHTS ON SRI'S PROPOSED REAL TIME CLOCK\nRe: NWG/RFC's #28 and 29.\n\
    The addition of a clock in one or more of the network HOST's seems to be\nvery\
    \ desireable since it (or they) would allow user-oriented message\ndelay measurements.\
    \  Our present network measurement facilities do not\ninclude any internal HOST\
    \ delays, and these delays may be an appreciable\nportion of the total delay encountered\
    \ by a HOST-to-HOST message\ntransmission.  We may find that an extension of our\
    \ \"Trace\" capabilities\nto include internal HOST delays would be an appropriate\
    \ mechanism for\nutilizing such a clock.  Such usage would require a clock at\
    \ both the\nsource and the destination of the message, although such clocks would\n\
    not have to be particularly accurate nor synchronized.  Other tests,\nsuch as\
    \ the absolute overall message delay from HOST A to HOST B would\nrequire synchronization\
    \ of the two clocks.\nA reasonable specification for the SRI real-time clock would\
    \ seem to\ninclude a resolution of about 1 msec., an accuracy of about 1 part\
    \ in\n10E7 (so that two such clocks could maintain reasonable relative\naccuracies\
    \ over periods of many hours), and a range of about 24 hours.\nA crystal controlled\
    \ clock should easily meet these requirements at a\nmoderate cost.\nThe choice\
    \ of the mechanism by which the HOST can read the clock appears\nto be of concern\
    \ also.  The 1 msec. resolution may require that the\nclock be entirely hardware\
    \ (as opposed to a core location which would be\nincremented at each clock pulse),\
    \ and therefore the clock may require\nsome rather compli- cated interface circuitry.\n\
    At UCLA, we presently have two clocks on the Sigma 7, and one of these\nhas a\
    \ resolution of about 2 msec. which might be usable for some\ninternal HOST measurements.\
    \  However, it does not have the long term\naccuracy for the absolute measurements\
    \ mentioned above.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry\
