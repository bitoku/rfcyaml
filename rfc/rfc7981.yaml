- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   There are several situations where it is useful for the\
    \ IS-IS\n   [ISO10589] [RFC1195] routers to learn the capabilities of the other\n\
    \   routers of their IS-IS level, area, or routing domain.  For the sake\n   of\
    \ illustration, three examples related to MPLS Traffic Engineering\n   (TE) are\
    \ described here:\n   1.  Mesh-group: The setting up of a mesh of TE Label Switched\
    \ Paths\n       (LSPs) [RFC5305] requires some significant configuration effort.\n\
    \       [RFC4972] proposes an auto-discovery mechanism whereby every\n       Label\
    \ Switching Router (LSR) of a mesh advertises its mesh-group\n       membership\
    \ by means of IS-IS extensions.\n   2.  Point-to-Multipoint TE LSP (RFC4875):\
    \ A specific sub-TLV\n       [RFC5073] allows an LSR to advertise its Point-to-Multipoint\n\
    \       capabilities ([RFC4875] and [RFC4461]).\n   3.  Inter-area traffic engineering:\
    \ Advertisement of the IPv4 and/or\n       the IPv6 Traffic Engineering Router\
    \ IDs.\n   The use of IS-IS for Path Computation Element (PCE) discovery may\n\
    \   also be considered and will be discussed in the PCE WG.\n   The capabilities\
    \ mentioned above require the specification of new\n   sub-TLVs carried within\
    \ the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV defined in\n   this document.\n   Note that\
    \ the examples above are provided for the sake of\n   illustration.  This document\
    \ proposes a generic capability\n   advertising mechanism that is not limited\
    \ to MPLS Traffic\n   Engineering.\n   This document defines a new optional IS-IS\
    \ TLV named CAPABILITY,\n   formed of multiple sub-TLVs, which allows a router\
    \ to announce its\n   capabilities within an IS-IS level or the entire routing\
    \ domain.  The\n   applications mentioned above require the specification of new\
    \ sub-\n   TLVs carried within the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV defined in this\n\
    \   document.\n   Definition of these sub-TLVs is outside the scope of this document.\n"

    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV
  contents:
  - "2.  IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV\n   The IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV is composed\
    \ of 1 octet for the type,\n   1 octet that specifies the number of bytes in the\
    \ value field, and a\n   variable length value field that starts with 4 octets\
    \ of Router ID,\n   indicating the source of the TLV, followed by 1 octet of flags.\n\
    \   A set of optional sub-TLVs may follow the flag field.  Sub-TLVs are\n   formatted\
    \ as described in [RFC5305].\n    TYPE: 242\n      LENGTH: from 5 to 255\n   \
    \   VALUE:\n        Router ID (4 octets)\n        Flags (1 octet)\n        Set\
    \ of optional sub-TLVs (0-250 octets)\n    Flags\n                0 1 2 3 4 5\
    \ 6 7\n                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n                | Reserved  |D|S|\n\
    \                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n   Currently, two bit flags are defined.\n\
    \   S bit (0x01): If the S bit is set(1), the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV\n  \
    \ MUST be flooded across the entire routing domain.  If the S bit is\n   not set(0),\
    \ the TLV MUST NOT be leaked between levels.  This bit MUST\n   NOT be altered\
    \ during the TLV leaking.\n   D bit (0x02): When the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV\
    \ is leaked from\n   Level 2 (L2) to Level 1 (L1), the D bit MUST be set.  Otherwise,\
    \ this\n   bit MUST be clear.  IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLVs with the D bit set\n\
    \   MUST NOT be leaked from Level 1 to Level 2.  This is to prevent TLV\n   looping.\n\
    \   The IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV is OPTIONAL.  As specified in\n   Section\
    \ 3, more than one IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV from the same\n   source MAY be\
    \ present.\n   This document does not specify how an application may use the IS-IS\n\
    \   Router CAPABILITY TLV, and such specification is outside the scope of\n  \
    \ this document.\n"
- title: 3.  Elements of Procedure
  contents:
  - "3.  Elements of Procedure\n   The Router ID SHOULD be identical to the value\
    \ advertised in the\n   Traffic Engineering Router ID TLV [RFC5305].  If no Traffic\n\
    \   Engineering Router ID is assigned, the Router ID SHOULD be identical\n   to\
    \ an IP Interface Address [RFC1195] advertised by the originating\n   IS.  If\
    \ the originating node does not support IPv4, then the reserved\n   value 0.0.0.0\
    \ MUST be used in the Router ID field, and the IPv6 TE\n   Router ID sub-TLV [RFC5316]\
    \ MUST be present in the TLV.  IS-IS Router\n   CAPABILITY TLVs that have a Router\
    \ ID of 0.0.0.0 and do NOT have the\n   IPv6 TE Router ID sub-TLV present MUST\
    \ NOT be used.\n   When advertising capabilities with different flooding scopes,\
    \ a\n   router MUST originate a minimum of two IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLVs,\n\
    \   each TLV carrying the set of sub-TLVs with the same flooding scope.\n   For\
    \ instance, if a router advertises two sets of capabilities, C1 and\n   C2, with\
    \ an area/level scope and routing domain scope respectively,\n   C1 and C2 being\
    \ specified by their respective sub-TLV(s), the router\n   will originate two\
    \ IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLVs:\n   o  One IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV with the\
    \ S flag cleared, carrying\n      the sub-TLV(s) relative to C1.  This IS-IS Router\
    \ CAPABILITY TLV\n      will not be leaked into another level.\n   o  One IS-IS\
    \ Router CAPABILITY TLV with the S flag set, carrying the\n      sub-TLV(s) relative\
    \ to C2.  This IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV will\n      be leaked into other IS-IS\
    \ levels.  When the TLV is leaked from\n      Level 2 to Level 1, the D bit will\
    \ be set in the Level 1 LSP\n      advertisement.\n   In order to prevent the\
    \ use of stale IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLVs, a\n   system MUST NOT use an IS-IS\
    \ Router CAPABILITY TLV present in an LSP\n   of a system that is not currently\
    \ reachable via Level x paths, where\n   \"x\" is the level (1 or 2) in which\
    \ the sending system advertised the\n   TLV.  This requirement applies regardless\
    \ of whether or not the\n   sending system is the originator of the IS-IS Router\
    \ CAPABILITY TLV.\n   When an IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV is not used, either\
    \ due to a lack\n   of reachability to the originating router or due to an unusable\n\
    \   Router ID, note that leaking the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV is one\n   of\
    \ the uses that is prohibited under these conditions.\n      Example: If Level\
    \ 1 router A generates an IS-IS Router CAPABILITY\n      TLV and floods it to\
    \ two L1/L2 routers, S and T, they will flood\n      it into the Level 2 domain.\
    \  Now suppose the Level 1 area\n      partitions, such that A and S are in one\
    \ partition and T is in\n      another.  IP routing will still continue to work,\
    \ but if A now\n      issues a revised version of the CAP TLV, or decides to stop\n\
    \      advertising it, S will follow suit, but without the above\n      prohibition,\
    \ T will continue to advertise the old version until\n      the LSP times out.\n\
    \      Routers in other areas have to choose whether to trust T's copy of\n  \
    \    A's IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV or S's copy of A's IS-IS Router\n      CAPABILITY\
    \ TLV, and they have no reliable way to choose.  By\n      making sure that T\
    \ stops leaking A's information, the possibility\n      that other routers will\
    \ use stale information from A is\n      eliminated.\n   In IS-IS, the atomic\
    \ unit of the update process is a TLV -- or more\n   precisely, in the case of\
    \ TLVs that allow multiple entries to appear\n   in the value field (e.g., IS-neighbors),\
    \ the atomic unit is an entry\n   in the value field of a TLV.  If an update to\
    \ an entry in a TLV is\n   advertised in an LSP fragment different from the LSP\
    \ fragment\n   associated with the old advertisement, the possibility exists that\n\
    \   other systems can temporarily have either 0 copies of a particular\n   advertisement\
    \ or 2 copies of a particular advertisement, depending on\n   the order in which\
    \ new copies of the LSP fragment that had the old\n   advertisement and the fragment\
    \ that has the new advertisement arrive\n   at other systems.\n   Wherever possible,\
    \ an implementation SHOULD advertise the update to\n   an IS-IS Router CAPABILITY\
    \ TLV in the same LSP fragment as the\n   advertisement that it replaces.  Where\
    \ this is not possible, the two\n   affected LSP fragments should be flooded as\
    \ an atomic action.\n   Systems that receive an update to an existing IS-IS Router\
    \ CAPABILITY\n   TLV can minimize the potential disruption associated with the\
    \ update\n   by employing a holddown time prior to processing the update so as\
    \ to\n   allow for the receipt of multiple LSP fragments associated with the\n\
    \   same update prior to beginning processing.\n   Where a receiving system has\
    \ two copies of an IS-IS Router CAPABILITY\n   TLV from the same system that have\
    \ conflicting information for a\n   given sub-TLV, the procedure used to choose\
    \ which copy shall be used\n   is undefined.\n"
- title: 4.  Interoperability with Routers Not Supporting the IS-IS Router
  contents:
  - "4.  Interoperability with Routers Not Supporting the IS-IS Router\n    CAPABILITY\
    \ TLV\n   Routers that do not support the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV MUST\n \
    \  silently ignore the TLV(s) and continue processing other TLVs in the\n   same\
    \ LSP.  Routers that do not support specific sub-TLVs carried\n   within an IS-IS\
    \ Router CAPABILITY TLV MUST silently ignore the\n   unsupported sub-TLVs and\
    \ continue processing those sub-TLVs that are\n   supported in the IS-IS Router\
    \ CAPABILITY TLV.  How partial support\n   may impact the operation of the capabilities\
    \ advertised within the\n   IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV is outside the scope of\
    \ this document.\n   In order for IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLVs with domain-wide\
    \ scope\n   originated by L1 routers to be flooded across the entire domain, at\n\
    \   least one L1/L2 router in every area of the domain MUST support the\n   Router\
    \ CAPABILITY TLV.\n   If leaking of the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV is required,\
    \ the entire\n   CAPABILITY TLV MUST be leaked into another level without change\n\
    \   (except for changes to the TLV flags as noted in Section 2) even\n   though\
    \ it may contain some sub-TLVs that are unsupported by the\n   router doing the\
    \ leaking.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Any new security issues raised by the procedures\
    \ in this document\n   depend upon the opportunity for LSPs to be snooped and\
    \ modified, the\n   ease/difficulty of which has not been altered.  As the LSPs\
    \ may now\n   contain additional information regarding router capabilities, this\n\
    \   new information would also become available to an attacker.\n   Specifications\
    \ based on this mechanism need to describe the security\n   considerations around\
    \ the disclosure and modification of their\n   information.  Note that an integrity\
    \ mechanism, such as the ones\n   defined in [RFC5304] or [RFC5310], should be\
    \ applied if there is high\n   risk resulting from modification of capability\
    \ information.\n"
