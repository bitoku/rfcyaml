  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF has completed its work on the core specification
    of TWAMP --\n   the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol [RFC5357].  TWAMP is an\n
    \  extension of the One-way Active Measurement Protocol, OWAMP\n   [RFC4656].
    \ The TWAMP specification gathered wide review as it\n   approached completion,
    and the by-products were several\n   recommendations for new features in TWAMP.
    \ There are a growing\n   number of TWAMP implementations at present, and widespread
    usage is\n   expected.  There are even devices that are designed to test\n   implementations
    for protocol compliance.\n   This memo describes an OPTIONAL feature for TWAMP.
    \ [RFC5357] TWAMP\n   (and OWAMP) start all previously requested and accepted
    test sessions\n   at once.  This feature allows the Control-Client to control\n
    \  individual test sessions on the basis of their Session Identifier\n   (SID).
    \ This feature permits a short-duration TWAMP test to start\n   (and/or stop)
    during a longer test.  This feature permits a specific\n   diagnostic test to
    begin if intermediate results indicate that the\n   test is warranted, for example.\n
    \  This feature requires a Modes field bit position assignment and the\n   use
    of two new TWAMP command numbers (for the augmented Start and\n   Stop commands).
    \ This feature also specifies the use of a new Stop-N-\n   ACK Server response,
    to complete the symmetry of the session-stopping\n   process in the same way as
    the Start-ACK (Start-N-ACK when used with\n   this feature) response.\n   The
    Individual Session Control feature gives the Control-Client new\n   flexibility
    to manage any number of test sessions once they are\n   established.  However,
    [RFC5357] test sessions are established in\n   serial order and the total establishment
    time grows with the number\n   of sessions and the round-trip time.  Therefore,
    implementers of this\n   feature may also wish to implement the \"Reflect Octets\"
    feature,\n   described in [REFLECT].  This feature allows a Control-Client to\n
    \  distinguish between parallel Request-TW-Session commands because a\n   participating
    Server can return octets (e.g., the Control-Client's\n   local index) in its reply
    to the request.  Thus, the Reflect Octets\n   feature supports the efficient establishment
    of many simultaneous\n   test sessions that the Individual Session Control feature
    can then\n   manage (start/stop).\n   This memo is an update to the TWAMP core
    protocol specified in\n   [RFC5357].  Measurement systems are not required to
    implement the\n   feature described in this memo to claim compliance with [RFC5357].\n
    \  Throughout this memo, the bits marked MBZ (Must Be Zero) MUST be set\n   to
    zero by senders and MUST be ignored by receivers.  Also, the HMAC\n   (Hashed
    Message Authentication Code) MUST be calculated as defined in\n   Section 3.2
    of [RFC4656].\n"

    title: 1.1.  Requirements Language
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Purpose and Scope\n   The purpose of this memo is to describe an additional
    OPTIONAL\n   function and feature for TWAMP [RFC5357].\n   The scope of the memo
    is limited to specifications of the following\n   features:\n   1.  extension
    of the modes of operation through assignment of a new\n       value in the Modes
    field to communicate feature capability and\n       use,\n   2.  the definitions
    of augmented start session and stop session\n       commands (with corresponding
    acknowledgements), and\n   3.  the definition of related procedures for TWAMP
    entities.\n   The motivation for this feature is the ability to start and stop\n
    \  individual test sessions at will, using a single TWAMP-Control\n   connection.\n
    \  When the Server and Control-Client have agreed to use the Individual\n   Session
    Control mode during control connection setup, then the\n   Control-Client, the
    Server, the Session-Sender, and the Session-\n   Reflector MUST all conform to
    the requirements of that mode, as\n   identified below.  The original TWAMP-Control
    Start and Stop commands\n   MUST NOT be used.\n"
  title: 2.  Purpose and Scope
- contents:
  - "3.  TWAMP Control Extensions\n   The TWAMP-Control protocol is a derivative of
    the OWAMP-Control\n   protocol, and provides two-way measurement capability.  TWAMP\n
    \  [RFC5357] uses the Modes field to identify and select specific\n   communication
    capabilities, and this field is a recognized extension\n   mechanism.  The following
    sections describe one such extension.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Connection Setup with Individual Session Control\n   TWAMP-Control connection
      establishment follows the procedure defined\n   in Section 3.1 of [RFC4656]
      OWAMP.  The Individual Session Control\n   mode requires one new bit position
      (and value) to identify the\n   ability of the Server/Session-Reflector to start
      and stop specific\n   sessions (according to their Session Identifier, or SID).
      \ This new\n   feature requires an additional TWAMP mode bit assignment as follows:\n
      \  Value  Description             Reference/Explanation\n   0      Reserved\n
      \  1      Unauthenticated         RFC 4656, Section 3.1\n   2      Authenticated
      \          RFC 4656, Section 3.1\n   4      Encrypted               RFC 4656,
      Section 3.1\n   8      Unauth. TEST protocol,  RFC 5618, Section 3.1\n          Encrypted
      CONTROL\n   --------------------------------------------------------\n   16
      \    Individual Session      RFC 5938, bit position 4\n          Control\n   In
      the original OWAMP Modes field, setting bit positions 0, 1, or 2\n   indicated
      the security mode of the Control protocol, and the Test\n   protocol inherited
      the same mode (see Section 4 of [RFC4656]).  In\n   the [RFC5618] memo, bit
      position (3) allows a different security mode\n   in the Test protocol and uses
      the unauthenticated test packet format.\n   If the Server sets the new bit position
      (bit position 4) in the\n   Server Greeting message to indicate its capabilities,
      then the Server\n   and Session-Reflector MUST comply with the requirements
      of this memo\n   to control sessions on an individual basis if desired.\n   If
      the Control-Client intends to control sessions on an individual\n   basis (according
      to the requirements in this memo), it MUST set the\n   mode bit (4, corresponding
      to the new mode) in the Setup Response\n   message.  This means that:\n   1.
      \ The Control-Client and the Server MUST use the start and stop\n       commands
      intended for individual session control and the\n       corresponding acknowledgements,
      as defined in the sections that\n       follow.\n   2.  The Control-Client and
      the Server MUST NOT use the start and stop\n       commands (2 and 3) and the
      acknowledgement defined in [RFC5357].\n   The Control-Client MUST also set one
      mode bit to indicate the chosen\n   security mode (currently bits 0, 1, 2, or
      3), consistent with the\n   modes offered by the Server.  The Control-Client
      MAY also set Modes\n   field bit 4 with other features and bit positions (such
      as the\n   reflect octets feature).\n"
