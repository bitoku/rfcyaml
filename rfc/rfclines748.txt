1.  Command name and code.
The sender  of this command  REQUESTS  permission  to, or confirms that it will, randomly lose.
The sender of this command REFUSES to randomly lose.
The sender  of this command  REQUESTS that the receiver, or grants the receiver permission to, randomly lose.
The command sender DEMANDS that the receiver not randomly lose.
LOSE DON'T RANDOMLY LOSE i.e., random lossage will not happen.
Several  hosts appear  to provide  random  lossage,
such  as  system crashes,  lost data,  incorrectly functioning programs, etc., as part of their services.
These services are often undocumented and are in general  quite confusing  to the novice  user.
A general  means  is needed to allow the user to disable these features.
Telnet Randomly Lose Option 5.
The normal  mode does not allow random  lossage; therefore the system is not allowed  to crash,  mung user files, etc.
If the server wants to provide  random lossage, it must first ask for permission from the user by sending IAC WILL RANDOMLY LOSE.
If the user wants  to permit  the server  to randomly lose, it replys with  IAC  DO   RANDOMLY LOSE.
it   sends   IAC   DONT RANDOMLY LOSE, and the server is forbidden from randomly losing.
Alternatively, the user could request the server to randomly lose, by sending  IAC DO RANDOMLY LOSE,  and the server will either reply with IAC
meaning that it will then proceed to do some random  lossage  (garbaging  disk files is recommended for an initial implementation).
Or,  it could send IAC WONT RANDOMLY LOSE, meaning that it insists upon being reliable.
Since  this is implemented  as a TELNET  option,  it is expected that servers  which do not implement  this option  will not randomly lose; ie, they will provide 100% reliable uptime.
