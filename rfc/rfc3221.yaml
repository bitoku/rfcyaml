  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document examines the various longer term trends visible\
    \ within\n   the characteristics of the Internet's BGP table and identifies a\n\
    \   number of operational practices and protocol factors that contribute\n   to\
    \ these trends.  The potential impacts of these practices and\n   protocol properties\
    \ on the scaling properties of the inter-domain\n   routing space are examined.\n\
    \   These impacts include the potential for exhaustion of the existing\n   Autonomous\
    \ System number space, increasing convergence times for\n   selection of stable\
    \ alternate paths following withdrawal of route\n   announcements, the stability\
    \ of table entries, and the average prefix\n   length of entries in the BGP table.\
    \  The larger long term issue is\n   that of an increasingly denser inter-connectivity\
    \ mesh between ASes,\n   causing a finer degree of granularity of inter-domain\
    \ policy and\n   finer levels of control to undertake inter-domain traffic\n \
    \  engineering.\n   Various approaches to a refinement of the inter-domain routing\n\
    \   protocol and associated operating practices that may provide superior\n  \
    \ scaling properties are identified as an area for further\n   investigation.\n\

- title: 2.   Network Scaling and Inter-Domain Routing
  contents:
  - "2.   Network Scaling and Inter-Domain Routing\n   Are there inherent scaling\
    \ limitations in the technology of the\n   Internet or its architecture of deployment\
    \ that may impact on the\n   ability of the Internet to meet escalating levels\
    \ of demand? There\n   are a number of potential areas to search for such limitations.\n\
    \   These include the capacity of transmission systems, packet switching\n   capacity,\
    \ the continued availability of protocol addresses, and the\n   capability of\
    \ the routing system to produce a stable view of the\n   overall topology of the\
    \ network.  In this study we will look at this\n   latter capability with the\
    \ objective of identifying some aspects of\n   the scaling properties of the Internet's\
    \ routing system.\n   The basic structure of the Internet is a collection of networks,\
    \ or\n   Autonomous Systems (ASes) that are interconnected to form a connected\n\
    \   domain.  Each AS uses an interior routing system to maintain a\n   coherent\
    \ view of the topology within the AS, and uses an exterior\n   routing system\
    \ to maintain adjacency information with neighboring\n   ASes to create a view\
    \ of the connectivity of the entire system.\n   This network-wide connectivity\
    \ is described in the routing table used\n   by the BGP4 protocol (referred to\
    \ as the Routing Information Base, or\n   RIB).  Each entry in the table refers\
    \ to a distinct route.  The\n   attributes of the route, together with local policy\
    \ constraints, are\n   used to determine the best path from the local AS to the\
    \ AS that is\n   originating the route.  Determining the 'best path' in this case\
    \ is\n   determining which routing advertisement and associated next hop\n   address\
    \ is the most preferred by the local AS.  Within each local\n   BGP-speaking router\
    \ this preferred route is then loaded into the\n   local RIB (Loc-RIB).  This\
    \ information is coupled with information\n   obtained from the local instance\
    \ of the interior routing protocol to\n   form a Forwarding Information Base (or\
    \ FIB), for use by the local\n   router's forwarding engine.\n   The BGP routing\
    \ system is not aware of finer level of topology of the\n   network on a link-by-link\
    \ basis within the local AS or within any\n   remote AS.  From this perspective\
    \ BGP can be seen as an inter-AS\n   connectivity maintenance protocol, as distinct\
    \ from a link-level\n   topology management protocol, and the BGP routing table\
    \ can be viewed\n   as a description of the current connectivity of the Internet\
    \ using an\n   AS as the basic element of connectivity computation.\n   There\
    \ is an associated dimension of policy determination within the\n   routing table.\
    \  If an AS advertises a route to a neighboring AS, the\n   local AS is offering\
    \ to accept traffic from the neighboring AS which\n   is ultimately destined to\
    \ addresses described by the advertised\n   routing entry.  If the local AS does\
    \ not originate the route, then\n   the inference is that the local AS is willing\
    \ to undertake the role\n   of transit provider for this traffic on behalf of\
    \ some third party.\n   Similarly, an AS may or may not choose to accept a route\
    \ from a\n   neighbor.  Accepting a route implies that under some circumstances,\n\
    \   as determined by the local route selection parameters, the local AS\n   will\
    \ use the neighboring AS to reach addresses spanned by the route.\n   The BGP\
    \ routing domain is intended to maintain a coherent view of the\n   connectivity\
    \ of the inter-AS domain, where connectivity is expressed\n   as a preference\
    \ for 'shortest paths' to reach any destination address\n   as modulated by the\
    \ connectivity policies expressed by each AS, and\n   coherence is expressed as\
    \ a global constraint that none of the paths\n   contains loops or dead ends.\
    \  The elements of the BGP routing domain\n   are routing entries, expressed as\
    \ a span of addresses.  All addresses\n   advertised within each routing entry\
    \ share a common origin AS and a\n   common connectivity policy.  The total size\
    \ of the BGP table is\n   therefore a metric of the number of distinct routes\
    \ within the\n   Internet, where each route describes a contiguous set of addresses\n\
    \   that share a common origin AS and a common reachability policy.\n   When the\
    \ scaling properties of the Internet were studied in the early\n   1990s two critical\
    \ factors identified in the study were, not\n   surprisingly, routing and addressing\
    \ [2].  As more devices connect to\n   the Internet they consume addresses, and\
    \ the associated function of\n   maintaining reachability information for these\
    \ addresses, with an\n   assumption of an associated growth in the number of distinct\
    \ provider\n   networks and the number of distinct connectivity policies, implies\n\
    \   ever larger routing tables.  The work in studying the limitations of\n   the\
    \ 32 bit IPv4 address space produced a number of outcomes,\n   including the specification\
    \ of IPv6 [3], as well as the refinement of\n   techniques of network address\
    \ translation [4] intended to allow some\n   degree of transparent interaction\
    \ between two networks using\n   different address realms.  Growth in the routing\
    \ system is not\n   directly addressed by these approaches, as the routing space\
    \ is the\n   cross product of the complexity of the inter-AS topology of the\n\
    \   network, multiplied by the number of distinct connectivity policies\n   multiplied\
    \ by the degree of fragmentation of the address space.  For\n   example, use of\
    \ NAT may reduce the pressure on the number of public\n   addresses required by\
    \ a single connected network, but it does not\n   necessarily imply that the network's\
    \ connectivity policies can be\n   subsumed within the aggregated policy of a\
    \ single upstream provider.\n   When an AS advertises a block of addresses into\
    \ the exterior routing\n   space this entry is generally carried across the entire\
    \ exterior\n   routing domain of the Internet.  To measure the common\n   characteristics\
    \ of the global routing table, it is necessary to\n   establish a point in the\
    \ default-free part of the exterior routing\n   domain and examine the BGP routing\
    \ table that is visible at that\n   point.\n"
- title: 3.  Measurements of the total size of the BGP Table
  contents:
  - "3.  Measurements of the total size of the BGP Table\n   Measurements of the size\
    \ of the routing table were somewhat sporadic\n   to start, and a number of measurements\
    \ were taken at approximate\n   monthly intervals from 1988 until 1992 by Merit\
    \ [5].  This effort was\n   resumed in 1994 by Erik-Jan Bos at Surfnet in the\
    \ Netherlands, who\n   commenced measuring the size of the BGP table at hourly\
    \ intervals in\n   1994.  This measurement technique was adopted by the author\
    \ in 1997,\n   using a measurement point located at the edge of AS 1221 at Telstra\n\
    \   in Australia, again using an hourly interval for the measurement.\n   The\
    \ initial measurements were of the number of routing entries\n   contained within\
    \ the set of selected best paths.  These measurements\n   were expanded to include\
    \ the number of AS numbers, number of AS\n   paths, and a set of measurements\
    \ relating to the prefix size of\n   routing table entries.\n   This data  contains\
    \ a view of the dynamics of the Internet's routing\n   table growth that spans\
    \ some 13 years in total and includes a very\n   detailed view spanning the most\
    \ recent seven years [6].  Looking at\n   just the total size of the BGP routing\
    \ table over this period, it is\n   possible to identify four distinct phases\
    \ of inter-AS routing\n   practice in the Internet.\n"
- title: 3.1  Pre-CIDR Growth
  contents:
  - "3.1  Pre-CIDR Growth\n   The initial characteristics of the routing table size\
    \ from 1988 until\n   April 1994 show definite characteristics of exponential\
    \ growth.  If\n   continued unchecked, this growth would have lead to saturation\
    \ of the\n   available BGP routing table space in the non-default routers of the\n\
    \   time within a small number of years.\n   Estimates of the time at which this\
    \ would've happened varied somewhat\n   from study to study, but the overall general\
    \ theme of these\n   observations was that the growth rates of the BGP routing\
    \ table were\n   exceeding the growth in hardware and software capability of the\n\
    \   deployed network, and that at some point in the mid-1990's, the BGP\n   table\
    \ size would have grown to the point where it was larger than the\n   capabilities\
    \ of available equipment to support.\n"
- title: 3.2  CIDR Deployment
  contents:
  - "3.2  CIDR Deployment\n   The response from the engineering community was the\
    \ introduction of a\n   hierarchy into the inter-domain routing system.  The intent\
    \ of the\n   hierarchical routing structure was to allow a provider to merge the\n\
    \   routing entries for its customers into a single routing entry that\n   spanned\
    \ its entire customer base.  The practical aspects of this\n   change was the\
    \ introduction of routing protocols that dispensed with\n   the requirement for\
    \ the Class A, B and C address delineation,\n   replacing this scheme with a routing\
    \ system that carried an address\n   prefix and an associated prefix length. \
    \ This approached was termed\n   Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) [5].\n\
    \   A concerted effort was undertaken in 1994 and 1995 to deploy CIDR\n   routing\
    \ in the Internet, based on encouraging deployment of the\n   CIDR-capable version\
    \ of the BGP protocol, BGP4 [7].\n   The intention of CIDR was one of hierarchical\
    \ provider address\n   aggregation, where a network provider was allocated an\
    \ address block\n   from an address registry, and the provider announced this\
    \ entire\n   block into the exterior routing domain as a single entry with a\n\
    \   single routing policy.  Customers of the provider were encouraged to\n   use\
    \ a sub-allocation from the provider's address block, and these\n   smaller routing\
    \ elements were aggregated by the provider and not\n   directly passed into the\
    \ exterior routing domain.  During 1994 the\n   size of the routing table remained\
    \ relatively constant at some 20,000\n   entries as the growth in the number of\
    \ providers announcing address\n   blocks was matched by a corresponding reduction\
    \ in the number of\n   address announcements as a result of CIDR aggregation.\n"
- title: 3.3  CIDR Growth
  contents:
  - "3.3  CIDR Growth\n   For the next four years until the start of 1998, CIDR proved\n\
    \   effective in damping unconstrained growth in the BGP routing table.\n   During\
    \ this period, the BGP table grew at an approximate linear rate,\n   adding some\
    \ 10,000 entries per year.\n   A close examination of the table reveals a greater\
    \ level of stability\n   in the routing system at this time.  The short term (hourly)\n\
    \   variation in the number of announced routes reduced, both as a\n   percentage\
    \ of the number of announced routes, and also in absolute\n   terms.  One of the\
    \ other benefits of using large aggregate address\n   blocks is that instability\
    \ at the edge of the network is not\n   immediately propagated into the routing\
    \ core.  The instability at the\n   last hop is absorbed at the point where an\
    \ aggregate route is used in\n   place of a collection of more specific routes.\
    \  This, coupled with\n   widespread adoption of BGP route flap damping, was very\
    \ effective in\n   reducing the short term instability in the routing space during\
    \ this\n   period.\n"
- title: 3.4  Current Growth
  contents:
  - "3.4  Current Growth\n   In late 1998 the trend of growth in the BGP table size\
    \ changed\n   radically, and the growth for the period 1998 - 2000 is again showing\n\
    \   all the signs of a re-establishment of a growth trend with strong\n   correlation\
    \ to an exponential growth model.  This change in the\n   growth trend appears\
    \ to indicate that pressure to use hierarchical\n   address allocations and CIDR\
    \ has been unable to keep pace with the\n   levels of growth of the Internet,\
    \ and some additional factors that\n   impact the growth in the BGP table size\
    \ have become more prominent in\n   the Internet.  This has lead to a growth pattern\
    \ in the total size of\n   the BGP table that has more in common with a compound\
    \ growth model\n   than a linear model.  A good fit of the data for the period\
    \ from\n   January 1999 until December 2000 is a compound growth model of 42%\n\
    \   growth per year.\n   An initial observation is that this growth pattern points\
    \ to some\n   weakening of the hierarchical model of connectivity and routing\n\
    \   within the Internet.  To identify the characteristics of this recent\n   trend\
    \ it is necessary to look at a number of related characteristics\n   of the routing\
    \ table.\n   BGP table size data for the first half of 2001 shows different trends\n\
    \   at various measurement points in the Internet.  Some measurement\n   points\
    \ where the local AS has a relative larger number of more\n   specific routes\
    \ show a steady state for the first half of 2001 with\n   no appreciable growth,\
    \ while other measurement points where the local\n   AS has had a lower number\
    \ of more specific routes initially show a\n   continuation of table size growth.\
    \  There are a number of commonly\n   observed discontinuities in the data for\
    \ 2001, corresponding to\n   events where a significant number of more specific\
    \ entries have been\n   replaced by an encompassing aggregate prefix.\n"

    \   of each routing entry.\n"
- title: 4.1  AS Number Consumption
  contents:
  - "4.1  AS Number Consumption\n   Each network that is multi-homed within the topology\
    \ of the Internet\n   and wishes to express a distinct external routing policy\
    \ must use a\n   unique AS number to associate its advertised addresses with such\
    \ a\n   policy.  In general, each network is associated with a single AS, and\n\
    \   the number of ASes in the default-free routing table tracks the\n   number\
    \ of entities that have unique routing policies.  There are some\n   exceptions\
    \ to this, including large global transit providers with\n   varying regional\
    \ policies, where multiple ASes are associated with a\n   single network, but\
    \ such exceptions are relatively uncommon.\n   The number of unique ASes present\
    \ in the BGP table has been tracked\n   since late 1996, and the trend of AS number\
    \ deployment over the past\n   four years is also one that matches a compound\
    \ growth model with a\n   growth rate of 51% per year.  As of the start of May\
    \ 2001 there were\n   some 10,700 ASes visible in the BGP table.  At a continued\
    \ rate of\n   growth of 51% p.a., the 16 bit AS number space will be fully deployed\n\
    \   by August 2005.  Work is underway within the IETF to modify the BGP\n   protocol\
    \ to carry AS numbers in a 32-bit field. [8]  While the\n   protocol modifications\
    \ are relatively straightforward, the major\n   responsibility rests with the\
    \ operations community to devise a\n   transition plan that will allow gradual\
    \ transition into this larger\n   AS number space.\n"
- title: 4.2  Address Consumption
  contents:
  - "4.2  Address Consumption\n   It is also possible to track the total amount of\
    \ address space\n   advertised within the BGP routing table.  At the start of\
    \ 2001 the\n   routing table encompassed 1,081,131,733 addresses, or some 25.17%\
    \ of\n   the total IPv4 address space, or 25.4% of the usable unicast public\n\
    \   address space.  By September 2001 this has growth to 1,123,124,472\n   addresses,\
    \ or some 26% of the IPv4 address space.  This has grown\n   from 1,019,484,655\
    \ addresses in November 1999.  However, there are a\n   number of /8 prefixes\
    \ that are periodically announced and withdrawn\n   from the BGP table, and if\
    \ the effects of these prefixes is removed,\n   a compound growth model against\
    \ the previous 12 months of data of\n   this metric yields a best fit model of\
    \ growth of 7% per year in the\n   total number of addresses spanned by the routing\
    \ table.\n   Compared to the 42% growth in the number of routing advertisements,\n\
    \   the growth in the amount of address space advertised is far lower.\n   One\
    \ possible explanation is that much of the growth of the Internet\n   in terms\
    \ of growth in the number of connected devices is occurring\n   behind various\
    \ forms of NAT gateways.  In terms of solving the\n   perceived finite nature\
    \ of the address space identified just under a\n   decade ago, this explanation\
    \ would tend to indicate that the Internet\n   appears so far to have embraced\
    \ the approach of using NATs,\n   irrespective of their various perceived functional\
    \ shortcomings. [9]\n   This explanation also supports the observation of smaller\
    \ address\n   fragments supporting distinct policies in the BGP table, as such\n\
    \   small address blocks may encompass arbitrarily large networks located\n  \
    \ behind one or more NAT gateways.  There are alternative explanations\n   of\
    \ this difference between the growth of the table and the growth of\n   address\
    \ space, including a trend towards discrete exterior routing\n   policies being\
    \ applied to finer address blocks.\n"
- title: 4.3  Granularity of Table Entries
  contents:
  - "4.3  Granularity of Table Entries\n   The intent of CIDR aggregation was to support\
    \ the use of large\n   aggregate address announcements in the BGP routing table.\
    \  To confirm\n   whether this is still the case the average span of each BGP\n\
    \   announcement has been tracked for the past 12 months.  The data\n   indicates\
    \ a decline in the average span of a BGP advertisement from\n   16,000 individual\
    \ addresses in November 1999 to 12,100 in December\n   2000.  As of September\
    \ 2001 this span has been further reduced to an\n   average 10,700 individual\
    \ addresses per routing entry.  This\n   corresponds to an increase in the average\
    \ prefix length from /18.03\n   to /18.44 by December 2000 and a /18.6 by September\
    \ 2001.  Separate\n   observations of the average prefix length used to route\
    \ traffic in\n   operation networks in late 2000 indicate an average length of\
    \ 18.1\n   [11].  This trend towards finer-grained entries in the routing table\n\
    \   is potentially cause for concern, as it implies the increasing spread\n  \
    \ of traffic over greater numbers of increasingly smaller forwarding\n   table\
    \ entries.  This, in turn, has implications for the design of\n   high speed core\
    \ routers, particularly when extensive use is made of a\n   small number of very\
    \ high speed cached forwarding entries within the\n   switching subsystem of a\
    \ router's design.\n   A similar observation can be made regarding the number\
    \ of addresses\n   advertised per AS.  In December 1999 each AS advertised an\
    \ average of\n   161,900 addresses (equivalent to a prefix length /14.69, and\
    \ in\n   January 2001 this average has fallen to 115,800 addresses, an\n   equivalent\
    \ prefix length of /15.18.\n   This points to increasingly finer levels of routing\
    \ detail being\n   announced into the global routing domain.  This, in turn, supports\n\
    \   the observation that the efficiencies of hierarchical routing\n   structures\
    \ are no longer being fully realized within the deployed\n   Internet.  Instead,\
    \ increasingly finer levels of routing detail are\n   being announced globally\
    \ in the BGP tables.  The most likely cause of\n   this trend of finer levels\
    \ of routing granularity is an increasingly\n   dense interconnection mesh, where\
    \ more networks are moving from a\n   single-homed connection with hierarchical\
    \ addressing and routing into\n   multi-homed connections without any hierarchical\
    \ structure.  The spur\n   for this increasingly dense connectivity mesh in the\
    \ Internet may\n   well be the declining unit costs of communications bearer services\n\
    \   coupled with a common perception that richer sets of adjacencies\n   yields\
    \ greater levels of service resilience.\n"

    \ of /19 and, more\n   recently, /20.\n   These measures were introduced in the\
    \ mid-90's when there were some\n   20,000 - 30,000 entries in the BGP table.\
    \  Some six years later in\n   April 2001 it is interesting to note that of the\
    \ 108,000 entries in\n   the routing table, some 59,000 entries have a /24 prefix.\
    \  In\n   absolute terms the /24 prefix set is the fastest growing set in the\n\
    \   BGP routing table.  The routing entries of these smaller address\n   blocks\
    \ also show a much higher level of change on an hourly basis.\n   While a large\
    \ number of BGP routing points perform route flap\n   damping, nevertheless there\
    \ is still a very high level of\n   announcements and withdrawals of these entries\
    \ in this particular\n   area of the routing table when viewed using a perspective\
    \ of route\n   updates per prefix length.  Given that the numbers of these small\n\
    \   prefixes are growing rapidly, there is cause for some concern that\n   the\
    \ total level of BGP flux, in terms of the number of announcements\n   and withdrawals\
    \ per second may be increasing, despite the pressures\n   from flap damping. \
    \ This concern is coupled with the observation\n   that, in terms of BGP stability\
    \ under scaling pressure, it is not the\n   absolute size of the BGP table that\
    \ is of prime importance, but the\n   rate of dynamic path re-computations that\
    \ occur in the wake of\n   announcements and withdrawals.  Withdrawals are of\
    \ particular concern\n   due to the number of transient intermediate states that\
    \ the BGP\n   distance vector algorithm explores in processing a withdrawal.\n\
    \   Current experimental observations indicate a typical convergence time\n  \
    \ of some 2 minutes to propagate a route withdrawal across the BGP\n   domain.\
    \ [10]\n   An increase in the density of the BGP mesh, coupled with an increase\n\
    \   in the rate of such dynamic changes, does have serious implications\n   in\
    \ maintaining the overall stability of the BGP system as it\n   continues to grow.\
    \  The registry allocation policies also have had\n   some impact on the routing\
    \ table prefix distribution.  The original\n   registry practice was to use a\
    \ minimum allocation unit of a /19, and\n   the 10,000 prefix entries in the /17\
    \ to /19 range are a consequence\n   of this policy decision.  More recently,\
    \ the allocation policy now\n   allows for a minimum allocation unit of a /20\
    \ prefix, and the /20\n   prefix is used by some 4,300 entries as of January 2001,\
    \ and in\n   relative terms is one of the fastest growing prefix sets.  The number\n\
    \   of entries corresponding to very small address blocks (smaller than a\n  \
    \ /24), while small in number as a proportion of the total BGP routing\n   table,\
    \ is the fastest growing in relative terms.  The number of /25\n   through /32\
    \ prefixes in the routing table is growing faster, in terms\n   of percentage\
    \ change, than any other area of the routing table.  If\n   prefix length filtering\
    \ were in widespread use, the practice of\n   announcing a very small address\
    \ block with a distinct routing policy\n   would have no particular beneficial\
    \ outcome, as the address block\n   would not be passed throughout the global\
    \ BGP routing domain and the\n   propagation of the associated policy would be\
    \ limited in scope.  The\n   growth of the number of these small address blocks,\
    \ and the diversity\n   of AS paths associated with these routing entries, points\
    \ to a\n   relatively limited use of prefix length filtering in today's\n   Internet.\
    \  In the absence of any corrective pressure in the form of\n   widespread adoption\
    \ of prefix length filtering, the very rapid growth\n   of global announcements\
    \ of very small address blocks is likely to\n   continue.  In percentage terms,\
    \ the set of prefixes spanning /25 to\n   /32 show the largest growth rates.\n"

    \   specifically referenced address prefix.\n   Another use of this mechanism\
    \ is to perform a rudimentary form of\n   load balancing and mutual backup for\

    \ such that\n   the load on each connection is approximately balanced.  The two\
    \ forms\n   of holes can be readily discerned in the routing table - while the\n\
    \   approach of policy differentiation uses an AS path that is different\n   from\
    \ the aggregate advertisement, the load balancing and mutual\n   backup configuration\
    \ uses the same As path for both the aggregate and\n   the specific advertisements.\

    \ not within the original\n   intent of CIDR deployment, there appears to be very\
    \ widespread use of\n   this mechanism within the routing table.  Some 59,000\
    \ advertisements,\n   or 55% of the total number of routing table entries, are\
    \ being used\n   to punch policy holes in existing aggregate announcements.  Of\

    \ where there are a\n   number of networks in relatively close proximity, using\

  contents:
  - "7.1  Policy opaqueness vs. policy transparency\n   The two major approaches to\
    \ routing protocols are distance vector and\n   link state.\n   In the distance\
    \ vector protocol a routing node gathers information\n   from its neighbors, applies\
    \ local policy to this information and then\n   distributes this updated information\
    \ to its neighbors.  In this model\n   the nature of the local policy applied\
    \ to the routing information is\n   not necessarily visible to the node's neighbors,\
    \ and the process of\n   converting received route advertisements into advertised\
    \ route\n   advertisements uses a local policy process whose policy rules are\
    \ not\n   visible externally.  This scenario can be described as 'policy\n   opaque'.\
    \  The side effect of such an environment is that a third\n   party cannot remotely\
    \ compute which routes a network may accept and\n   which may be re-advertised\
    \ to each neighbor.\n   In link state protocols a routing node effectively broadcasts\
    \ its\n   local adjacencies, and the policies it has with respect to these\n \
    \  adjacencies, to all nodes within the link state domain.  Every node\n   can\
    \ perform an identical computation upon this set of adjacencies and\n   associated\
    \ policies in order to compute the local forwarding table.\n   The essential attribute\
    \ of this environment is that the routing node\n   has to announce its routing\
    \ policies, in order to allow a remote node\n   to compute which routes will be\
    \ accepted from which neighbor, and\n   which routes will be advertised to each\
    \ neighbor and what, if any,\n   attributes are placed on the advertisement. \
    \ Within an interior\n   routing domain the local policies are in effect metrics\
    \ of each link\n   and these polices can be announced within the routing domain\
    \ without\n   any consequent impact.\n   In the exterior routing domain it is\
    \ not the case that\n   interconnection policies between networks are always fully\n\
    \   transparent.  Various permutations of supplier / customer\n   relationships\
    \ and peering relationships have associated policy\n   qualifications that are\
    \ not publicly announced for business\n   competitive reasons.  The current diversity\
    \ of interconnection\n   arrangements appears to be predicated on policy opaqueness,\
    \ and to\n   mandate a change to a model of open interconnection policies may\
    \ be\n   contrary to operational business imperatives.\n   An inter-domain routing\
    \ tool should be able to support models of\n   interconnection where the policy\
    \ associated with the interconnection\n   is not visible to any third party. \
    \ If the architectural choice is a\n   constrained one between distance vector\
    \ and link state, then this\n   consideration would appear to favor the continued\
    \ use of a distance\n   vector approach to inter-domain routing.  This choice,\
    \ in turn, has\n   implications on the convergence properties and stability of\
    \ the\n   inter-domain routing environment.  If there is a broader spectrum of\n\

- title: 7.2  The number of routing objects
  contents:
  - "7.2  The number of routing objects\n   The current issues with the trend behaviors\
    \ of the BGP space can be\n   coarsely summarized as the growth in the number\
    \ of distinct routing\n   objects, the increased level of dynamic behaviors of\
    \ these objects\n   (in the form of announcements and withdrawals).\n   This entails\
    \ evaluating possible measures that can address the growth\n   rate in the number\
    \ of objects in the inter-domain routing table, and\n   separately examining measures\
    \ that can reduce the level of dynamic\n   change in the routing table.  The current\
    \ routing architecture\n   defines a basic unit of a route object as an originating\
    \ AS number\n   and an address prefix.\n   In looking at the growth rate in the\
    \ number of route objects, the\n   salient observation is that the number of route\
    \ objects is the\n   byproduct of the density of the interconnection mesh and\
    \ the number\n   of discrete points where policy is imposed of route objects.\
    \  One\n   approach to reduce the growth in the number of objects is to allow\n\
    \   each object to describe larger segments of infrastructure.  Such an\n   approach\
    \ could use a single route object to describe a set of address\n   prefixes, or\
    \ a collection of ASs, or a combination of the two.  The\n   most direct form\
    \ of extension would be to preserve the assumption\n   that each routing object\
    \ represents an indivisible policy entity.\n   However, given that one of the\
    \ drivers of the increasing number of\n   route objects is a proliferation of\
    \ discrete route objects, it is not\n   immediately apparent that this form of\
    \ aggregation will prove capable\n   in addressing the growth in the number of\
    \ route objects.\n   If single route objects are to be used that encompass a set\
    \ of\n   address prefixes and a collection of ASs, then it appears necessary\n\
    \   to define additional attributes within the route object to further\n   qualify\
    \ the policies associated with the object in terms of specific\n   prefixes, specific\
    \ ASs and specific policy semantics that may be\n   considered as policy exceptions\
    \ to the overall aggregate\n   Another approach to reduce the number of route\
    \ objects is to reduce\n   the scope of advertisement of each routing object,\
    \ allowing the\n   object to be removed and proxy aggregated into some larger\
    \ object\n   once the logical scope of the object has been reached.  This approach\n\
    \   would entail the addition of route attributes that could be used to\n   define\
    \ the circumstances where a specific route object would be\n   subsumed by an\
    \ aggregate route object without impacting the policy\n   objectives associated\
    \ with the original set of advertisements.\n"
- title: 7.3  Inter-domain Traffic Engineering
  contents:
  - "7.3  Inter-domain Traffic Engineering\n   Attempting to place greater levels\
    \ of detail into route objects is\n   intended to address the dual role of the\
    \ current BGP system as both\n   an inter-domain connectivity maintenance protocol\
    \ and as an implicit\n   traffic engineering tool.\n   In the current environment,\
    \ advertisement of more specific prefixes\n   with unique policy but with the\
    \ same origin AS is often intended to\n   create a traffic engineering response,\
    \ where incoming traffic to an\n   AS may be balanced across multiple paths. \
    \ The outcome is that the\n   control of the relative profile of load is placed\
    \ with the\n   originating AS.  The way this is achieved is by using limited\n\
    \   knowledge of the remote AS's route selection policy to explicitly\n   limit\
    \ the number of egress choices available to a remote AS.  The\n   most common\
    \ route selection policy is the preference for more\n   specific prefixes over\
    \ larger address blocks.  By advertising\n   specific prefixes along specific\
    \ neighbor AS connections with\n   specific route attributes, traffic destined\
    \ to these addresses is\n   passed through the selected transit paths.  This limitation\
    \ of choice\n   allows the originating AS to override the potential policy choices\
    \ of\n   all other ASs, imposing its traffic import policies at a higher level\n\
    \   than the remote AS's egress policies.\n   An alternative approach is the use\
    \ of a class of traffic engineering\n   attributes that are attached to an aggregate\
    \ route object.  The\n   intent of such attributes is to direct each remote AS\
    \ to respond to\n   the route object in a manner that equates to the current response\
    \ to\n   more specific advertisements, but without the need to advertise\n   specific\
    \ prefix route objects.  However, even this approach uses\n   route objects to\
    \ communicate traffic engineering policy, and the same\n   risk remains that the\
    \ route table is used to carry fine-detailed\n   traffic path policies.\n   An\
    \ alternative direction is to separate the functions of connectivity\n   maintenance\
    \ and traffic engineering, using the routing protocol to\n   identify a number\
    \ of viable paths from a source AS to a destination\n   AS, and use a distinct\
    \ collection of traffic engineering tools to\n   allow a traffic source AS to\
    \ make egress path selections that match\n   the desired traffic service profile\
    \ for the traffic.\n   There is one critical difference between traffic engineering\n\
    \   approaches as used in intra-domain environments and the current\n   inter-domain\
    \ operating practices.  Whereas the intra-domain\n   environment uses the ingress\
    \ network element to make the appropriate\n   path choice to the egress point,\
    \ the inter domain traffic engineering\n   has the opposite intent, where a downstream\
    \ AS (or egress point) is\n   attempting to influence the path choice of an upstream\
    \ AS (or ingress\n   point).  If explicit traffic engineering were undertaken\
    \ within the\n   inter-domain space, it is highly likely that the current structure\n\
    \   would be altered.  Instead of the downstream element attempting to\n   constrain\
    \ the path choices of an upstream element, a probable\n   approach is the downstream\
    \ element placing a number of advisory\n   constraints on the upstream elements,\
    \ and the upstream elements using\n   a combination of these advisory constraints,\
    \ dynamic information\n   relating to path service characteristics and local policies\
    \ to make\n   an egress choice.\n   From the perspective of the inter-domain routing\
    \ environment, such\n   measures offer the potential to remove the advertisement\
    \ of specific\n   routes for traffic engineering purposes.  However, there is\
    \ a need to\n   adding traffic engineering information into advertised route blocks,\n\
    \   requiring the definition of the syntax and semantics of traffic\n   engineering\
    \ attributes that can be attached to route objects.\n"
- title: 7.4  Hierarchical Routing Models

  - "7.4  Hierarchical Routing Models\n   The CIDR routing model assumed a hierarchy\
    \ of providers, where at\n   each level in the hierarchy the routing policies\
    \ and address space of\n   networks at the lower level of hierarchy were subsumed\
    \ by the next\n   level up (or 'upstream') provider.  The connectivity policy\
    \ assumed\n   by this model is also a hierarchical model, where horizontal\n \
    \  connections within a single level of the hierarchy are not visible\n   beyond\
    \ the networks of the two parties.\n   A number of external factors are increasing\
    \ the density of\n   interconnection including decreasing unit costs of communications\n\
    \   services and the increasing use of exchange points to augment point-\n   to-point\
    \ connectivity models with point-to-multi-point facilities.\n   The outcome of\
    \ these external factors is a significant reduction in\n   the hierarchical nature\
    \ of the inter-domain space.  Such a trend can\n   be viewed with concern given\
    \ the common approach of using hierarchies\n   as a tool for scaling routing systems.\
    \  BGP falls within this\n   approach, and relies on hierarchies in the address\
    \ space to contain\n   the number of independently routing objects.  The outcomes\
    \ of this\n   characteristic of the Internet in terms of the routing space is\
    \ the\n   increasing number of distinct route policies that are associated with\n\
    \   each multi-homed network within the Internet.\n   One way to limit the proliferation\
    \ of such policies across the entire\n   inter-domain space is to associate attributes\
    \ to such advertisements\n   that specify the conditions whereby a remote transit\
    \ AS may proxy-\n   aggregate this route object with other route objects.\n"
- title: 7.5  Extend or Replace BGP
  contents:
  - "7.5  Extend or Replace BGP\n   A final consideration is to consider whether these\
    \ requirements can\n   best be met by an approach of a set of upward-compatible\
    \ extensions\n   to BGP, or by a replacement to BGP.  No recommendation is made\
    \ here,\n   and this is a topic requiring further investigation.\n   The general\
    \ approach in extending BGP appears to lie in increasing\n   the number of supported\
    \ transitive route attributes, allowing the\n   route originator greater control\
    \ in specifying the scope of\n   propagation of the route and the intended outcome\
    \ in terms of policy\n   and traffic engineering.  It may also be necessary to\
    \ allow BGP\n   sessions to negotiate additional functionality intended to improve\n\
    \   the convergence behavior of the protocol.  Whether such changes can\n   produce\
    \ a scalable and useful outcome in terms of inter-domain\n   routing remains,\
    \ at this stage, an open question.\n   An alternative approach is that of a replacement\
    \ protocol, and such\n   an approach may well be based on the adoption of a link-state\n\
    \   behavior.  The issues of policy opaqueness and link-state protocols\n   have\
    \ been described above.  The other major issue with such an\n   approach is the\
    \ need to limit the extent of link state flooding,\n   where the inter-domain\
    \ space would need some further levels of\n   imposed structure similar to intra-domain\
    \ areas.  Such structure may\n   well imply the need for an additional set of\
    \ operator inter-\n   relationships such as mutual transit, and this may prove\
    \ challenging\n   to adapt to existing practices.\n   The potential sets of actions\
    \ include more than extend or replace the\n   BGP protocol.  A third approach\
    \ is to continue to use BGP as the\n   basic means of propagating route objects\
    \ and their associated AS\n   paths and other attributes, and use one or more\
    \ overlay protocols to\n   support inter-domain traffic engineering and other\
    \ forms of inter-\n   domain policy negotiation.  This approach would appear to\
    \ offer a\n   means of transition for the large installed base currently using\
    \ BGP4\n   as their inter-domain routing protocol, placing additional\n   functionality\
    \ in the overlay protocols while leaving the basic\n   functionality of BGP4 intact.\
    \  The resultant inter-dependencies\n   between BGP and the overlay protocols\
    \ would require very careful\n   attention, as this would be the most critical\
    \ aspect of such an\n   approach.\n"
- title: 8.  Directions for Further Activity
  contents:
  - "8.  Directions for Further Activity\n   While there may exist short term actions\
    \ based on providing various\n   incentives for network operators to remove redundant\
    \ or inefficiently\n   grouped entries from the BGP routing table, such actions\
    \ are short\n   term palliative measures, and will not provide long term answers\
    \ to\n   the need to a scalable inter-domain routing protocol.\n   One potential\
    \ short term protocol refinement is to allow a set of\n   grouped advertisements\
    \ to be aggregated into a single route\n   advertisement.  This form of proxy\
    \ aggregation would take a set of\n   bit-wise aligned routing entries with matching\
    \ route attributes, and\n   under certain well identified circumstances, aggregate\
    \ these routing\n   entries into a single re-advertised aggregate routing entry.\
    \  This\n   technique removes information from the routing system, and some care\n\
    \   must be taken to define a set of proxy aggregation conditions that do\n  \
    \ not materially alter the flow of traffic, or the ability of\n   originating\
    \ ASes to announce routing policy.\n   A further refinement to this approach is\
    \ to consider the definition\n   of the syntax and semantics of a number of additional\
    \ route\n   attributes.  Such attributes could define the extent to which\n  \
    \ specific route advertisements should be propagated in the inter-\n   domain\
    \ space, allowing the advertisement to be subsumed by a larger\n   aggregate advertisement\
    \ at the boundary of this domain.  This could\n   be used to form part of the\
    \ preconditions of automated proxy\n   aggregation of specific routes, and also\
    \ limit the extent to which\n   announcement and withdrawals are propagated across\
    \ the routing\n   domain.\n   It is unclear that such measures would result in\
    \ substantial longer\n   term changes to the scaling and convergence properties\
    \ of BGP4.\n   Taking the requirement set enumerated in section 6 of this document,\n\
    \   one approach to the longer term requirements may be to preserve a\n   number\
    \ of attributes of the current BGP protocol, while refine other\n   aspects of\
    \ the protocol to improve its scaling and convergence\n   properties.  A minimal\
    \ set of alterations could retain the Autonomous\n   System concept to allow for\
    \ boundaries of information summarization,\n   as well as retaining the approach\
    \ of associating each prefix\n   advertisement with an originating AS.  The concept\
    \ of policy\n   opaqueness would also be retained in such an approach, implying\
    \ that\n   each AS accepts a set of route advertisements, applies local policy\n\
    \   constraints, and re-advertises those advertisements permitted by the\n   local\
    \ policy constraints.  It could be feasible to consider\n   alterations to the\
    \ distance vector path selection algorithm,\n   particularly as it relates to\
    \ intermediate states during processing\n   of a route withdrawal.  It is also\
    \ feasible to consider the use of\n   compound route attributes, allowing a route\
    \ object to include an\n   aggregate route, and a number of specifics of the aggregate\
    \ route,\n   and attach attributes that may apply to the aggregate or a specific\n\
    \   address prefix.  Such route attributes could be used to support\n   multi-homing\
    \ and inter-domain traffic engineering mechanisms.  The\n   overall intent of\
    \ this approach is to address the major requirements\n   in the inter-domain routing\
    \ space without using an increasing set of\n   globally propagated specific route\
    \ objects.\n   A potential applied research topic is to consider the feasibility\
    \ of\n   de-coupling the requirements of inter-domain connectivity management\n\
    \   with the applications of policy constraints and the issues of sender-\n  \
    \ and/or receiver-managed traffic engineering requirements.  Such an\n   approach\
    \ may use a link-state protocol as a means of maintaining a\n   consistent view\
    \ of the topology of inter-domain network, and then use\n   some form of overlay\
    \ protocol to negotiate policy requirements of\n   each AS, and use a further\
    \ overlay to support inter-domain traffic\n   engineering requirements.  The underlying\
    \ assumption of such an\n   approach is that by dividing up the functional role\
    \ of inter-domain\n   routing into distinct components each component will have\
    \ superior\n   scaling and convergence properties which in turn to result in\n\
    \   superior properties for the entire routing system.  Obviously, this\n   assumption\
    \ requires some testing.\n   Research topics with potential longer term application\
    \ include the\n   approach of drawing a distinction between a network's identity,\
    \ a\n   network's location relative to other networks, and a feasible path\n \
    \  between a source and destination network that satisfies various\n   policy\
    \ and traffic engineering constraints.  Again the intent of such\n   an approach\
    \ would be to divide the current routing function into a\n   number of distinct\
    \ scalable components.\n"

  - "9. Security Considerations\n   Any adopted inter-domain routing protocol needs\
    \ to be secure against\n   disruption.  Disruption comes from two primary sources:\n\
    \      - Accidental misconfiguration\n      - Malicious attacks\n   Given past\
    \ experience with routing protocols, both can be significant\n   sources of harm.\n\
    \   Given that it is not reasonable to guarantee the security of all the\n   routers\
    \ involved in the global Internet inter-domain routing system,\n   there is also\
    \ every reason to believe that malicious attacks may come\n   from peer routers,\
    \ in addition to coming from external sources.\n   A protocol design should therefore\
    \ consider how to minimize the\n   damage to the overall routing computation that\
    \ can be caused by a\n   single or small set of misbehaving routers.\n   The routing\
    \ system itself needs to be resilient against accidental or\n   malicious advertisements\
    \ of a route object by a route server not\n   entitled to generate such an advertisement.\
    \  This implies several\n   things, including the need for cryptographic validation\
    \ of\n   announcements, cryptographic protection of various critical routing\n\
    \   messages and an accurate and trusted database of routing assignments\n   via\
    \ which authorization can be checked.\n"
