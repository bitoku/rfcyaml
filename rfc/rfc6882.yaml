- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide connectivity between\
    \ sites\n   across an IP/MPLS backbone.  These VPNs can be operated using\n  \
    \ BGP/MPLS, and a single Provider Edge (PE) node may provide access to\n   multiple\
    \ customer sites belonging to different VPNs.\n   The VPNs may support a number\
    \ of customer services, including RSVP\n   and Resource Reservation Protocol Traffic\
    \ Engineering (RSVP-TE)\n   traffic.  This document describes how to support RSVP-TE\
    \ between\n   customer sites when a single PE supports multiple VPNs and labels\
    \ are\n   not used to identify VPNs between PEs.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Service Providers would like to use BGP/MPLS IP VPNs [RFC4364]\
    \ to\n   support connections between Customer Edge (CE) sites.  As described\n\
    \   in [RFC5824], these connections can be MPLS Traffic Engineered (TE)\n   Label\
    \ Switched Paths (LSPs) established using extensions to RSVP\n   [RFC3209] for\
    \ a number of different deployment scenarios.  The\n   requirements for supporting\
    \ MPLS-TE LSP connections across BGP/MPLS\n   IP VPNs are documented in [RFC5824].\n\
    \   In order to establish a customer MPLS-TE LSP over a BGP/MPLS IP VPN,\n   it\
    \ is necessary for the RSVP-TE control messages, including the Path\n   and Resv\
    \ messages described in [RFC3209], to be handled appropriately\n   by the Provider\
    \ Edge (PE) routers.  [RFC4364] allows RSVP messages\n   sent within a VPN's context\
    \ to be handled just like any other VPN\n   data.  In such a solution, the RSVP-TE\
    \ component at a PE that sends\n   messages toward a remote PE must process the\
    \ messages in the context\n   of the VPN and must ensure that the messages are\
    \ correctly labeled.\n   Similarly, when a message sent across the core is received\
    \ by a PE,\n   both labels must indicate the correct VPN context.\n   Implementation\
    \ of the standards-based solution described in the\n   previous paragraph is possible,\
    \ but requires proper support on the\n   PE.  In particular, a PE must be able\
    \ to process RSVP messages within\n   the context of the appropriate VPN Routing\
    \ and Forwarding (VRF).\n   This may be easy to achieve in some implementations,\
    \ but in others,\n   it is not so easy.\n   This document defines experimental\
    \ formats and mechanisms that follow\n   a different approach.  The documented\
    \ approach enables the VPN\n   identifier to be carried in the RSVP-TE protocol\
    \ message so that\n   there is no requirement for label-based VRF identification\
    \ on the PE.\n   The experiment proposed by this document does not negate the\
    \ label-\n   based approach supported by [RFC4364].  The experiment is intended\
    \ to\n   enable research into alternate methods of supporting RSVP-TE within\n\
    \   VPNs.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Motivation\n   If multiple BGP/MPLS IP VPNs are supported at the same PE,\
    \ new RSVP-\n   TE extensions are required so that RSVP-TE control messages from\
    \ the\n   CEs can be handled appropriately by the PE.\n"

    \ BGP/MPLS IP VPNs\")\n   shows two VPNs supported by a core IP/MPLS network.\
    \  Both VPNs have\n   customer sites on the two PEs shown in the figure.  The\
    \ customer\n   sites operate MPLS-TE LSPs.\n   Here, we make the following set\
    \ of assumptions:\n   o  VPN1 and VPN2 are for different customers.\n   o  CE1\
    \ and CE3 are head-end routers.\n   o  CE2 and CE4 are tail-end routers.\n   o\
    \  The same address (e.g., 192.0.2.1) is assigned at CE2 and CE4.\n        <--------Customer\

    \      Figure 1: Customer MPLS TE LSPs in the context of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs\n  \
    \    Consider that customers in VPN1 and VPN2 would like to establish\n      customer\
    \ MPLS-TE LSPs between their sites (i.e., between CE1 and\n      CE2, and between\
    \ CE3 and CE4).  In this situation, the following\n      RSVP-TE Path messages\
    \ would be sent:\n      1. CE1 would send a Path message to PE1 to establish the\
    \ MPLS-TE\n         LSP (VPN1) between CE1 and CE2.\n      2. CE3 would also send\
    \ a Path message to PE1 to establish the\n         MPLS-TE LSP (VPN2) between\
    \ CE1 and CE2.\n   After receiving each Path message, PE1 can identify the customer\n\
    \   context for each Path message from the incoming interface over which\n   the\
    \ message was received.  PE1 forwards the messages to PE2 using the\n   routing\
    \ mechanisms described in [RFC4364] and [RFC4659].\n   When the Path messages\
    \ are received at PE2, that node needs to\n   distinguish the messages and determine\
    \ which applies to VPN1 and\n   which to VPN2 so that the right forwarding state\
    \ can be established\n   and so that the messages can be passed on to the correct\
    \ CE.\n   Although the messages arrive at PE2 with an MPLS label that\n   identifies\
    \ the VPN, the messages are delivered to the RSVP-TE\n   component on PE2, and\
    \ the context of the core VPN LSP (i.e., the\n   label) is lost.  Some RSVP-TE\
    \ protocol mechanism is therefore needed\n   to embed the VPN identifier within\
    \ the RSVP-TE message.\n   Similarly, Resv messages sent from PE2 to PE1 need\
    \ an RSVP-TE\n   mechanism to assign them to the correct VPN.\n"

    \ messages per VPN\n   in the context of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.  Section 3.1 defines\

- title: 3.2.1.  Path Message Processing at the Ingress PE
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Path Message Processing at the Ingress PE\n   When a Path message arrives\
    \ at the ingress PE (PE1 in Figure 1), the\n   PE needs to establish suitable\
    \ Path state and forward the Path\n   message on to the egress PE (PE2 in Figure\
    \ 1).  Below, we describe\n   the message handling process at the ingress PE.\n\
    \      1. CE1 sends a Path message to PE1 to establish the MPLS-TE LSP\n     \
    \    (VPN1) between CE1 and CE2.  The Path message is addressed to\n         the\
    \ eventual destination (the receiver at the remote customer\n         site) and\
    \ carries the IP Router Alert option, in accordance\n         with [RFC2205].\
    \  The ingress PE must recognize the router\n         alert, intercept these messages,\
    \ and process them as RSVP-TE\n         signaling messages.\n      2. When the\
    \ ingress PE receives a Path message from a CE that is\n         addressed to\
    \ the receiver, the VRF that is associated with the\n         incoming interface\
    \ can be identified.  (This step does not\n         deviate from current behavior.)\n\
    \      3. The tunnel endpoint address of the receiver is looked up in the\n  \
    \       appropriate VRF, and the BGP next hop for that tunnel endpoint\n     \
    \    address is identified.  The next hop is the egress PE.\n      4. A new LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6\
    \ SESSION object is\n         constructed, containing the Route Distinguisher\
    \ (RD) that is\n         part of the VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 route prefix for this tunnel\n\
    \         endpoint address, and the IPv4/IPv6 tunnel endpoint address\n      \
    \   from the original SESSION object.\n      5. A new LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4/IPv6\
    \ SENDER_TEMPLATE object is\n         constructed, with the original IPv4/IPv6\
    \ tunnel sender address\n         from the incoming SENDER_TEMPLATE plus the RD\
    \ that is used by\n         the PE to advertise the prefix for the customers VPN.\n\
    \      6. A new Path message is sent containing all the objects from the\n   \
    \      original Path message, replacing the original SESSION and\n         SENDER_TEMPLATE\
    \ objects with the new\n         LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 type objects.  This\
    \ Path message\n         is sent directly to the egress PE (the next hop that\
    \ was\n         determined in Step 3) without the IP Router Alert option.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  Path Message Processing at the Egress PE
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Path Message Processing at the Egress PE\n   Below, we describe the message\
    \ handling process at the egress PE.\n      1. When a Path message arrives at\
    \ the egress PE (PE2 in Figure 1),\n         it is addressed to the PE itself\
    \ and is handed to RSVP for\n         processing.\n      2. The router extracts\
    \ the RD and IPv4/IPv6 address from the\n         LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6\
    \ SESSION object and determines the\n         local VRF context by finding a matching\
    \ VPN-IPv4 prefix with\n         the specified RD that has been advertised by\
    \ this router into\n         BGP.\n      3. The entire incoming RSVP message,\
    \ including the VRF\n         information, is stored as part of the Path state.\n\
    \      4. The egress PE can now construct a Path message that differs\n      \
    \   from the Path message it received in the following ways:\n         a. Its\
    \ tunnel endpoint address is the IP address extracted from\n            the SESSION\
    \ object.\n         b. The SESSION and SENDER_TEMPLATE objects have been converted\n\
    \            back to IPv4-type/IPv6-type by discarding the attached RD.\n    \
    \     c. The RSVP_HOP object contains the IP address of the outgoing\n       \
    \     interface of the egress PE and a Logical Interface Handle\n            (LIH),\
    \ as per normal RSVP processing.\n      5. The egress PE then sends the Path message\
    \ towards its tunnel\n         endpoint address over the interface identified\
    \ in Step 4c.\n         This Path message carries the IP Router Alert option,\
    \ as\n         required by [RFC2205].\n"

    egress\" PE (it is the\n   egress with respect to the direction of data flow,\
    \ i.e., PE2 in\n   Figure 1).  Upon arriving at PE2, the SESSION and FILTER_SPEC\
    \ objects\n   in the Resv message, and the VRF in which the Resv was received,\

    \ SESSION object is replaced with the same\n   LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 SESSION\
    \ object received in the Path\n   message.  The LSP TUNNEL IPv4/IPv6 FILTER_SPEC\
    \ object is replaced\n   with a LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 FILTER_SPEC object,\
    \ which copies\n   the VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 address from the LSP TUNNEL SENDER_TEMPLATE\n\
    \   received in the matching Path message.\n   The Resv message MUST be addressed\
