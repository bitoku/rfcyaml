Addition to the Very Distant Host Specification
It has been brought to my attention that the following sentence should be added to the Very Distant Host specification in Appendix F of BBN report 1822, Specifications for the Interconnection of a Host and an IMP, to the paragraph beginning on page F 5 and ending on page F 7: "Null packets do not use a channel (nor a channel number) when sent and are not acknowledged when received.
" Please file this RFC with your copy of BBN report 1822 until 1822 is next updated.
