  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes a routing scenario where IPv4 packets\
    \ are\n   transported over an IPv6 network, based on [RFC6145] and [RFC6052],\n\
    \   along with a separate OSPFv3 routing table for IPv4-embedded IPv6\n   routes\
    \ in the IPv6 network.  This document does not introduce any new\n   IPv6 transition\
    \ mechanism.\n   In this document, the following terminology is used:\n   o  An\
    \ IPv4-embedded IPv6 address denotes an IPv6 address that\n      contains an embedded\
    \ 32-bit IPv4 address constructed according to\n      the rules defined in [RFC6052].\n\
    \   o  IPv4-embedded IPv6 packets are packets of which destination\n      addresses\
    \ are IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses.\n   o  AFBR (Address Family Border Router)\
    \ [RFC5565] refers to an edge\n      router that supports both IPv4 and IPv6 address\
    \ families, but the\n      backbone network it connects to only supports either\
    \ the IPv4 or\n      IPv6 address family.\n   o  AFXLBR (Address Family Translation\
    \ Border Router) is defined in\n      this document.  It refers to a border router\
    \ that supports both\n      IPv4 and IPv6 address families located on the boundary\
    \ of an IPv4-\n      only network and an IPv6-only network and that is capable\
    \ of\n      performing IP header translation between IPv4 and IPv6 [RFC6145].\n"
- title: 1.1.  The Scenario
  contents:
  - "1.1.  The Scenario\n   Due to exhaustion of public IPv4 addresses, there has\
    \ been a\n   continuing effort within the IETF to investigate and specify IPv6\n\
    \   transitional techniques.  In the course of the transition, it is\n   certain\
    \ that networks based on IPv4 and IPv6 technologies,\n   respectively, will coexist\
    \ at least for some time.  One such scenario\n   is the interconnection of IPv4-only\
    \ and IPv6-only networks, and in\n   particular, when an IPv6-only network serves\
    \ as an interconnection\n   between several segregated IPv4-only networks.  In\
    \ this scenario,\n   IPv4 packets are transported over the IPv6 network between\
    \ IPv4\n   networks.  In order to forward an IPv4 packet from a source IPv4\n\
    \   network to the destination IPv4 network, IPv4 reachability\n   information\
    \ must be exchanged between the IPv4 networks via some\n   mechanism.\n   In general,\
    \ running an IPv6-only network would reduce operational\n   expenditures and optimize\
    \ operations as compared to an IPv4-IPv6\n   dual-stack environment.  Some proposed\
    \ solutions allow the delivery\n   of IPv4 services over an IPv6-only network.\
    \  This document specifies\n   an engineering technique that separates the routing\
    \ table dedicated\n   to IPv4-embedded IPv6 destinations from the routing table\
    \ used for\n   native IPv6 destinations.\n   OSPFv3 is designed to support multiple\
    \ instances.  Maintaining a\n   separate routing table for IPv4-embedded IPv6\
    \ routes would simplify\n   implementation, troubleshooting, and operation; it\
    \ would also prevent\n   overload of the native IPv6 routing table.  A separate\
    \ routing table\n   can be generated from a separate routing instance.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Routing Solution per RFC 5565
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Routing Solution per RFC 5565\n   The aforementioned scenario is described\
    \ in [RFC5565], i.e., the\n   IPv4-over-IPv6 scenario, where the network core\
    \ is IPv6-only and the\n   interconnected IPv4 networks are called IPv4 client\
    \ networks.  The\n   P Routers (Provider Routers) in the core only support IPv6,\
    \ but the\n   AFBRs support IPv4 on interfaces facing IPv4 client networks and\
    \ IPv6\n   on interfaces facing the core.  The routing solution defined in\n \
    \  [RFC5565] for this scenario is to run IBGP among AFBRs to exchange\n   IPv4\
    \ routing information in the core, and the IPv4 packets are\n   forwarded from\
    \ one IPv4 client network to the other through a\n   softwire using tunneling\
    \ technology, such as MPLS, LSP, GRE,\n   L2TPv3, etc.\n"
- title: 1.3.  An Alternative Routing Solution with OSPFv3
  contents:
  - "1.3.  An Alternative Routing Solution with OSPFv3\n   In this document, we propose\
    \ an alternative routing solution for the\n   scenario described in Section 1.1\
    \ where several segregated IPv4\n   networks, called IPv4 client networks, are\
    \ interconnected by an IPv6\n   network.  The IPv6 network and the interconnected\
    \ IPv4 networks may\n   or may not belong to the same Autonomous System (AS).\
    \  We refer to\n   the border node on the boundary of an IPv4 client network and\
    \ the\n   IPv6 network as an Address Family Translation Border Router (AFXLBR),\n\
    \   which supports both the IPv4 and IPv6 address families and is capable\n  \
    \ of translating an IPv4 packet to an IPv6 packet, and vice versa,\n   according\
    \ to [RFC6145].  The described scenario is illustrated in\n   Figure 1.\n    \

    \  Figure 1: Segregated IPv4 Networks Interconnected by an IPv6 Network\n   Since\
    \ the scenario occurs most commonly within an organization, an\n   IPv6 prefix\
    \ can be locally allocated and used by AFXLBRs to construct\n   IPv4-embedded\
    \ IPv6 addresses [RFC6052].  The embedded IPv4 address or\n   prefix belongs to\
    \ an IPv4 client network that is connected to the\n   AFXLBR.  An AFXLBR injects\
    \ IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses and prefixes\n   into the IPv6 network using OSPFv3,\
    \ and it also installs\n   IPv4-embedded IPv6 routes advertised by other AFXLBRs.\n\
    \   When an AFXLBR receives an IPv4 packet from a locally connected IPv4\n   client\
    \ network destined to a remote IPv4 client network, it\n   translates the IPv4\
    \ header to the relevant IPv6 header [RFC6145], and\n   in that process, the source\
    \ and destination IPv4 addresses are\n   translated into IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses,\
    \ respectively [RFC6052].\n   The resulting IPv6 packet is then forwarded to the\
    \ AFXLBR that\n   connects to the destination IPv4 client network.  The remote\
    \ AFXLBR\n   derives the IPv4 source and destination addresses from the IPv4-\n\
    \   embedded IPv6 addresses, respectively [RFC6052], and translates the\n   header\
    \ of the received IPv6 packet to the relevant IPv4 header\n   [RFC6145].  The\
    \ resulting IPv4 packet is then forwarded according to\n   the IPv4 routing table\
    \ maintained on the AFXLBR.\n   There are use cases where the proposed routing\
    \ solution is useful.\n   One case is that some border nodes do not participate\
    \ in IBGP for the\n   exchange of routes, or IBGP is not used at all.  Another\
    \ case is when\n   tunnels are not deployed in the IPv6 network, or native IPv6\n\
    \   forwarding is preferred.  Note that with this routing solution, the\n   IPv4\
    \ and IPv6 header translation performed in both directions by the\n   AFXLBR is\
    \ stateless.\n"
- title: 1.4.  OSPFv3 Routing with a Specific Topology
  contents:
  - "1.4.  OSPFv3 Routing with a Specific Topology\n   In general, IPv4-embedded IPv6\
    \ packets can be forwarded just like\n   native IPv6 packets with OSPFv3 running\
    \ in the IPv6 network.\n   However, this would require that IPv4-embedded IPv6\
    \ routes be flooded\n   throughout the entire IPv6 network and stored on every\
    \ router.  This\n   is not desirable from a scaling perspective.  Moreover, since\
    \ all\n   IPv6 routes are stored in the same routing table, it would be\n   inconvenient\
    \ to manage the resource required for routing and\n   forwarding based on traffic\
    \ category, if so desired.\n   To improve the situation, a separate OSPFv3 routing\
    \ table dedicated\n   to the IPv4-embedded IPv6 topology can be constructed; that\
    \ table\n   would be solely used for routing IPv4-embedded IPv6 packets in the\n\
    \   IPv6 network.  The IPv4-embedded IPv6 topology includes all the\n   participating\
    \ AFXLBRs and a set of P Routers providing redundant\n   connectivity with alternate\
    \ routing paths.\n   To realize this, a separate OSPFv3 instance is configured\
    \ in the IPv6\n   network [RFC5838].  This instance operates on all participating\n\
    \   AFXLBRs and a set of P routers that interconnect them.  As a result,\n   there\
    \ would be a dedicated IPv4-embedded IPv6 topology that is\n   maintained on all\
    \ these routers, along with a dedicated IPv4-embedded\n   IPv6 routing table.\
    \  This routing table in the IPv6 network is solely\n   for forwarding IPv4-embedded\
    \ IPv6 packets.\n   This document elaborates on how configuration is done with\
    \ this\n   method and on related routing issues.\n   This document only focuses\

    \ that use a separate OSPFv3 routing\n   table for IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses\
    \ and prefixes, a decision must\n   be made regarding the set of routers and their\
    \ interfaces in the IPv6\n   network that should be part of the IPv4-embedded\
    \ IPv6 topology.\n   For the purpose of this IPv4-embedded IPv6 topology, all\
    \ AFXLBRs that\n   connect to IPv4 client networks MUST be members of this topology.\
    \  An\n   AFXLBR MUST have at least one connection with a P Router in the IPv6\n\
    \   network or another AFXLBR.\n   The IPv4-embedded IPv6 topology is a subtopology\
    \ of the entire IPv6\n   network, and if all routers (including AFXLBRs and P\
    \ routers) and all\n   their interfaces are included, the two topologies converge.\n\
    \   Generally speaking, when this subtopology contains more\n   interconnected\
    \ P Routers, there would be more routing paths across\n   the IPv6 network from\
    \ one IPv4 client network to the other; however,\n   this requires more routers\

    \ mechanism defined in [RFC5838].\n   It is assumed that the IPv6 network that\

    \ one administration,\n   and as such an OSPFv3 Instance ID (IID) is allocated\

- title: 4.1.  Address Translation
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Address Translation\n   Prior to address translation, an IPv6 prefix is\
    \ allocated by the\n   operator, and it is used to form IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses.\n\
    \   The IPv6 prefix can either be the IPv6 well-known prefix (WKP) 64:\n   ff9b::/96\
    \ or a network-specific prefix that is unique to the\n   organization; for the\
    \ latter case, the IPv6 prefix length may be 32,\n   40, 48, 56, or 64.  In either\
    \ case, this IPv6 prefix is used during\n   the address translation between an\
    \ IPv4 address and an IPv4-embedded\n   IPv6 address, as described in [RFC6052].\n\
    \   During translation from an IPv4 header to an IPv6 header at an\n   ingress\

    \ into the corresponding source IPv6 address and\n   destination IPv6 address,\

    \ in a\n   stateless manner.\n   When an IPv6 WKP is used, [RFC6052] allows only\

    \ composed of a\n   WKP and a non-global IPv4 address is hence invalid, and packets\
    \ that\n   contain such an address received by an AFXLBR are dropped.\n   In the\
    \ case where both the IPv4 client networks and the IPv6 transit\n   network belong\
    \ to the same organization, non-global IPv4 addresses\n   may be used with a network-specific\

- title: 5.1.1.  Routing Metrics
  contents:
  - "5.1.1.  Routing Metrics\n   By default, the metric in an AS-External-LSA that\
    \ carries an IPv4-\n   embedded IPv6 address or prefixes is a Type 1 external\
    \ metric, which\n   is comparable to the link state metric, and we assume that\
    \ in most\n   cases OSPFv2 is used in client IPv4 networks.  This metric is added\n\
    \   to the metric of the intra-AS path to the ASBR during the OSPFv3\n   route\
    \ calculation.  Through ASBR configuration, the metric can be set\n   to a Type\
    \ 2 external metric, which is considered much larger than the\n   metric for any\
    \ intra-AS path.  Refer to the OSPFv3 specification\n   [RFC5340] for more details.\
    \  In either case, an external metric may\n   take the same value as in an IPv4\
    \ network (using OSPFv2 or another\n   routing protocol) but may also be specified\
    \ based on some routing\n   policy, the details of which are beyond the scope\

    \ be an\n   IPv4-embedded IPv6 address where the embedded IPv4 address is the\n\
    \   destination address in an IPv4 client network.  However, since an\n   AFXLBR\
    \ sits on the border of an IPv4 network and an IPv6 network, it\n   is RECOMMENDED\
    \ that the \"Forwarding Address\" field not be used, so\n   that the AFXLBR can\
    \ make the forwarding decision based on its own\n   IPv4 routing table.\n"

- title: 7.  Forwarding
  contents:
  - "7.  Forwarding\n   There are three cases applicable to forwarding IP packets\
    \ in the\n   scenario described in this document:\n   1.  On an AFXLBR, if an\
    \ IPv4 packet is received on an interface\n       connecting to an IPv4 segregated\
    \ client network with a\n       destination IPv4 address belonging to another\
    \ IPv4 client\n       network, the header of the packet is translated to the\n\
    \       corresponding IPv6 header as described in Section 4, and the\n       packet\
    \ is then forwarded to the destination AFXLBR that\n       advertised the IPv4-embedded\
    \ IPv6 address into the IPv6 network.\n   2.  On an AFXLBR, if an IPv4-embedded\
    \ IPv6 packet is received and the\n       embedded destination IPv4 address is\
    \ in its IPv4 routing table,\n       the header of the packet is translated to\
    \ the corresponding IPv4\n       header as described in Section 4, and the packet\
    \ is then\n       forwarded accordingly.\n   3.  On any router that is within\
    \ the IPv4-embedded IPv6 topology\n       subset of the IPv6 network, if an IPv4-embedded\
    \ IPv6 packet is\n       received and a route is found in the IPv4-embedded IPv6\
    \ routing\n       table, the packet is forwarded to the IPv6 next hop, just like\n\
    \       the handling for a normal IPv6 packet, without any translation.\n   The\
    \ classification of an IPv4-embedded IPv6 packet is done according\n   to the\
    \ IPv6 prefix of the destination address, which is either the\n   WKP (i.e., 64:ff9b::/96)\
    \ or locally allocated as defined in\n   [RFC6052].\n"
- title: 8.  Backdoor Connections
  contents:
  - "8.  Backdoor Connections\n   In some deployments, IPv4 client networks are interconnected\
    \ across\n   the IPv6 network but are also directly connected to each other. \
    \ The\n   direct connections between IPv4 client networks, sometimes called\n\
    \   \"backdoor\" connections, can certainly be used to transport IPv4\n   packets\
    \ between IPv4 client networks.  In general, backdoor\n   connections are preferred\
    \ over the IPv6 network, since no address\n   family translation is required.\n"
- title: 9.  Prevention of Loops
  contents:
  - "9.  Prevention of Loops\n   If an LSA sent from an AFXLBR into a client network\
    \ could then be\n   received by another AFXLBR, it would be possible for routing\
    \ loops to\n   occur.  To prevent loops, an AFXLBR MUST set the DN bit [RFC4576]\
    \ in\n   any LSA that it sends to a client network.  The AFXLBR MUST also\n  \
    \ ignore any LSA received from a client network that already has the DN\n   bit\
    \ set.\n"
- title: 10.  MTU Issues
  contents:
  - "10.  MTU Issues\n   In the IPv6 network, there are no new MTU issues introduced\
    \ by this\n   document.  If a separate OSPFv3 instance (per [RFC5838]) is used\
    \ for\n   IPv4-embedded IPv6 routing, the MTU handling in the IPv6 network is\n\
    \   the same as that of the default OSPFv3 instance.\n   However, the MTU in the\
    \ IPv6 network may be different than that of\n   IPv4 client networks.  Since\
    \ an IPv6 router will never fragment a\n   packet, the packet size of any IPv4-embedded\
    \ IPv6 packet entering the\n   IPv6 network must be equal to or less than the\
    \ MTU of the IPv6\n   network.  In order to achieve this requirement, it is recommended\n\
    \   that AFXLBRs perform IPv6 path discovery among themselves.  The\n   resulting\
    \ MTU, after taking into account the difference between the\n   IPv4 header length\
    \ and the IPv6 header length, must be \"propagated\"\n   into IPv4 client networks,\
    \ e.g., included in the OSPFv2 Database\n   Description packet.\n   The details\
    \ of passing the proper MTU into IPv4 client networks are\n   beyond the scope\
    \ of this document.\n"
- title: 11.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "11.  Security Considerations\n   There are several security aspects that require\
    \ attention in the\n   deployment practices described in this document.\n   In\
    \ the OSPFv3 transit network, the security considerations for OSPFv3\n   are handled\
    \ as usual, and in particular, authentication mechanisms\n   described in [RFC6506]\
    \ can be deployed.\n   When a separate OSPFv3 instance is used to support IPv4-embedded\
    \ IPv6\n   routing, the same Security Association (SA) [RFC4552] MUST be used\
    \ by\n   the embedded IPv4 address instance as other instances utilizing the\n\
    \   same link, as specified in [RFC5838].\n   Security considerations as documented\
    \ in [RFC6052] must also be\n   thought through and properly implemented, including\
    \ the following:\n   o  The IPv6 prefix that is used to carry an embedded IPv4\
    \ address\n      (refer to Section 4.1) must be configured by the authorized\n\
    \      operator on all participating AFXLBRs in a secure manner.  This is\n  \
    \    to help prevent a malicious attack resulting in network\n      disruption,\
    \ denial of service, and possible information\n      disclosure.\n   o  Effective\
    \ mechanisms (such as reverse path checking) must be\n      implemented in the\
    \ IPv6 transit network (including AFXLBRs) to\n      prevent spoofing of embedded\
    \ IPv4 addresses, which otherwise might\n      be used as source addresses of\
    \ malicious packets.\n   o  If firewalls are used in IPv4 and/or IPv6 networks,\
    \ configuration\n      of the routers must be consistent, so that there are no\
    \ holes in\n      IPv4 address filtering.\n   The details of security handling\
    \ are beyond the scope of this\n   document.\n"
- title: 12.  Operational Considerations
  contents:
  - "12.  Operational Considerations\n   This document puts together some mechanisms\
    \ based on existing\n   technologies developed by the IETF as an integrated solution\
    \ to\n   transport IPv4 packets over an IPv6 network using a separate OSPFv3\n\
    \   routing table.  There are several aspects of these mechanisms that\n   require\
    \ attention for deployment and operation.\n   The tunnel-based solution documented\
    \ in [RFC5565] and the solution\n   proposed in this document are both used for\
    \ transporting IPv4 packets\n   over an IPv6 network, using different mechanisms.\
    \  The two methods\n   are not related to each other, and they can coexist in\
    \ the same\n   network if so deployed, without any conflict.\n   If one approach\
    \ is to be deployed, the operator will decide which\n   approach to use.  Note\
    \ that each approach has its own characteristics\n   and requirements.  For example,\
    \ the tunnel-based solution requires a\n   mesh of inter-AFBR softwires (tunnels)\
    \ spanning the IPv6 network, as\n   well as IBGP to exchange routes between AFBRs\
    \ [RFC5565]; the approach\n   in this document requires AFXLBRs that are capable\
    \ of performing\n   IPv4-IPv6 packet header translation per [RFC6145].\n   To\
    \ deploy the solution as documented here, some configurations are\n   required.\
    \  An IPv6 prefix must first be chosen that is used to form\n   all the IPv4-embedded\
    \ IPv6 addresses and prefixes advertised by\n   AFXLBRs in the IPv6 network; refer\
    \ to Section 4.1 for details.  The\n   IPv4-embedded IPv6 routing table is created\
    \ by using a separate\n   OSPFv3 instance in the IPv6 network.  As described in\
    \ Section 3.2,\n   this configuration is accomplished according to the mechanism\n\
    \   described in [RFC5838].\n   Note that this document does not change any behavior\
    \ of OSPFv3, and\n   the existing or common practice should apply in the context\
    \ of\n   scalability.  For example, the amount of routes that are advertised\n\
    \   by OSPFv3 is one key concern.  With the solution as described in this\n  \
    \ document, IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses and prefixes will be injected\n   by\
    \ AFXLBRs into some part of the IPv6 network (see Section 3.1 for\n   details),\
    \ and a separate routing table will be used for IPv4-embedded\n   IPv6 routing.\
    \  Care must be taken during network design such that 1)\n   aggregations are\
    \ performed on IPv4 addresses and prefixes before\n   being advertised in the\
    \ IPv6 network as described in Section 6, and\n   2) estimates are made as to\
    \ the amount of IPv4-embedded IPv6 routes\n   that would be disseminated in the\
    \ IPv6 network and to the size of the\n   separate OSPFv3 routing table.\n"
