    \ a new\n   codepoint registry for the flags field in the Session Attribute\n\
    \   object of the Resource Reservation Protocol Traffic Engineering\n   (RSVP-TE)\

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) [RFC2205] has been\
    \ extended\n   as RSVP for Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for use in Multiprotocol\n\
    \   Label Switching (MPLS) signaling [RFC3209] and Generalized MPLS\n   (GMPLS)\
    \ [RFC3473].\n   [RFC3209] introduced a new signaling object, the Session Attribute\n\
    \   object, that is carried on the RSVP Path message.  The Session\n   Attribute\
    \ object contains an eight-bit field of flags.\n   The original specification\
    \ of RSVP-TE assigned uses to three of these\n   bit flags.  Subsequent MPLS and\
    \ GMPLS RFCs have assigned further\n   flags.\n   There is a need for a codepoint\
    \ registry to track the use of the bit\n   flags in this field, to ensure that\
    \ bits are not assigned more than\n   once, and to define the procedures by which\
    \ such bits may be\n   assigned.\n   This document lists the current bit usage\
    \ and provides information\n   for IANA to create a new registry.  This document\
    \ does not define the\n   uses of specific bits -- definitive procedures for the\
    \ use of the\n   bits can be found in the referenced RFCs.\n"

    \   The new registry has been placed under the \"RSVP-TE Parameters\"\n   branch\
    \ of the tree.\n   The new registry has been termed \"Session Attribute Object\
    \ Flags.\"\n   Flags from this registry may only be assigned by IETF consensus\n\
    \   [RFC2434].\n   The registry references the flags already defined as described\
    \ in\n   Section 2 of this document.\n"
