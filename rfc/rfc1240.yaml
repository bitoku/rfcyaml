  contents:
  - "Status of this Memo\n   This document describes a protocol for running OSI Connectionless\n\
    \   service on UDP.  This RFC specifies an IAB standards track protocol\n   for\
    \ the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions\n   for improvements.\
    \  Please refer to the current edition of the \"IAB\n   Official Protocol Standards\"\
    \ for the standardization state and status\n   of this protocol.  Distribution\
    \ of this memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction and Philosophy
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction and Philosophy\n   The Internet community has a well-developed,\
    \ mature set of layered\n   transport and network protocols, which are quite successful\
    \ in\n   offering both connection-oriented (TCP) and connectionless (UDP)\n  \
    \ transport services over connectionless network services (IP) to end-\n   users.\
    \  Many popular network applications have been built directly on\n   top of the\
    \ TCP and UDP over the past decade.  These have helped the\n   Internet services\
    \ and protocols to become widely-spread de facto\n   standards.  In the past few\
    \ years, the ISO and CCITT have defined a\n   well-architected set of upper layer\
    \ standards which include\n   connection-oriented and connectionless session,\
    \ presentation, and\n   application layer services and protocols.  These OSI upper\
    \ layer\n   standards offer valuable services to application developers (e.g.,\n\
    \   dialogue control, transfer syntax, peer authentication, directory\n   services,\
    \ etc.) which are not currently offered by the TCP/IP\n   standards.\n   As indicated\
    \ in RFC 1006, it is desirable to offer the OSI upper\n   layer services directly\
    \ in the Internet without disrupting existing\n   facilities.  This permits a\
    \ more graceful convergence and transition\n   strategy from IP-based networks\
    \ to OSI-based networks in the future.\n   Using the approach of RFC 1006, this\
    \ memo specifies how to offer OSI\n   connectionless transport service using the\
    \ User Datagram Protocol\n   (UDP) [RFC768] of the TCP/IP suite.\n   We will define\
    \ a Transport Service Access Point (TSAP) which appears\n   to be identical to\
    \ the services and interfaces defined in ISO 8072\n   and its Addendum 1, but\
    \ we will in fact implement the ISO T-UNIT-DATA\n   protocol on top of UDP.  By\
    \ this means, OSI TPDU's can be delivered\n   across the Internet network, and\
    \ OSI connectionless upper layers can\n   operate fully without knowledge of the\
    \ fact that they are running on\n   top of UDP/IP.  In essence, the OSI T-UNIT-DATA\
    \ service will use UDP\n   as its connectionless network service provider.\n"
- title: 2.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "2.  Motivation\n   The primary motivation for the standard described in this\
    \ memo is to\n   facilitate the process of gaining experience with OSI connectionless\n\
    \   upper layers protocols, i.e., S-UNIT-DATA [ISO9548], P-UNIT-DATA\n   [ISO9576]\
    \ and A-UNIT-DATA [ISO10035], and connectionless transport\n   protocol T-UNIT-DATA\
    \ [ISO8602].\n   Though many OSI standard applications such as X.400 and FTAM\
    \ are\n   connection-oriented, it is recognized in the OSI reference model\n \
    \  [ISO7498/AD1] as well as in practice that the connectionless-mode\n   operations\
    \ are appropriate for certain distributed application\n   classes and environments.\
    \  The following connectionless application\n   classes were identified by ISO\
    \ SC21/WG6 [ISOSC21/WG6 N184]:\n         -    Request-Response Applications\n\
    \         -    Broadcast/Multicast\n         -    Inward Data Collection\n   \
    \      -    Migratory/Unreliable Processes\n   Among them, the \"request/response\"\
    \ client-server application class is\n   the most prominent one, which is gaining\
    \ popularity and importance.\n   It is observed that the connection setup and\
    \ tear-down protocol\n   exchanges and complex connection-oriented protocol machines\
    \ become\n   unnecessary overheads for a simple request/response exchange between\n\
    \   a client application and a server application, especially in reliable\n  \
    \ communications environments such as LAN and ISDN.  The OSI\n   connectionless\
    \ upper layers are thought to be highly effective and\n   efficient, both in time\
    \ and space, for the distributed application\n   classes mentioned above.\n  \
    \ The stability, maturity and wide availability of UDP/IP are ideal for\n   providing\
    \ solid connectionless transport services independent of\n   actual implementations.\n"
- title: 3.  The Model
  contents:
  - "3.  The Model\n   The [ISO 8072/AD1] standard describes the OSI connectionless\n\
    \   transport services definition. The [ISO 8602] standard describes the\n   OSI\
    \ connectionless transport protocols.  A defining characteristic of\n   transport\
    \ connectionless-mode transmission is the independent nature\n   of each invocation\
    \ of the connectionless transport service.\n   The OSI transport service definition\
    \ describes the services offered\n   by the TS-provider and the interfaces used\
    \ to access those services.\n   It also describes the services required.  This\
    \ memo focuses on how\n   UDP [RFC 768] can be used to offer the required services\
    \ and provide\n   the interfaces.\n   The following is the model:\n        +-----------+\

- title: 4.  The Primitives
  contents:
  - "4.  The Primitives\n   This RFC assumes that UDP [RFC768] offers the following\
    \ service\n   primitives:\n    send datagram  -  datagram is sent to the IP address/destination\n\
    \                      port\n    read datagram  -  datagram is read from UDP\n\
    \   Data can only be read from a receive port after the port has been\n   created.\
    \  This is a local matter.\n   This memo reserves the use of UDP port 102 for\
    \ the use of\n   applications which realize the CLTS over UDP.  However as with\
    \ RFC\n   1006, other port values may be used by prior agreement (e.g., through\n\
    \   use of the OSI Directory).\n   This RFC describes how to use these services\
    \ to emulate the following\n   connectionless-mode network service primitives,\
    \ which are required by\n   [ISO8602]:\n    N-UNIT-DATA.REQUEST     -  A NS-user\
    \ requests unit data to be sent\n    N-UNIT-DATA.INDICATION  -  A NS-user is notified\
    \ that unit data\n                               can be read from the NSAP\n \
    \  The mapping between the UDP service primitives and the service\n   primitives\
    \ expected by the connectionless transport peer entity are\n   quite straightforward:\n\

- title: 6.  Conclusion
  contents:
  - "6.  Conclusion\n   There is a general trend towards support of the OSI protocol\
    \ suite in\n   the Internet.  This direction is being fostered by the Internet\n\
    \   Activities Board (IAB) and its Internet Engineering Task Force, and\n   by\
    \ the Federal Networking Council.  By offering an OSI connectionless\n   transport\
    \ service on top of the Internet, this RFC will allow future\n   applications\
    \ to use the OSI connectionless upper-layer services,\n   which are required to\
    \ be conformant to the OSI upper layer\n   architecture.  Currently, T-UNIT-DATA,\
    \ S-UNIT-DATA, P-UNIT-DATA, and\n   A-UNIT-DATA have reached International Standard\
    \ (IS).  As\n   applications based on OSI connectionless services become widely\n\
    \   available and OSI lower-layer service is widely implemented in the\n   Internet,\
    \ the underlying UDP/IP services can be simply replaced with\n   the OSI lower\
    \ layers.\n"
