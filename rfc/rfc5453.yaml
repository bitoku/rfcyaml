  - "Abstract\n   Interface identifiers in IPv6 unicast addresses are used to identify\n\

    \  Several RFCs have specified interface identifiers or\n   identifier ranges\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   An IPv6 unicast address is composed of two parts: a subnet\
    \ prefix and\n   an interface identifier (IID) that identifies a unique interface\n\
    \   within the subnet prefix.  The structure of an IPv6 unicast address\n   is\
    \ depicted in \"IPv6 Addressing Architecture\" [RFC4291] and is\n   replicated\
    \ here for clarity.\n   |          n bits               |           128-n bits\
    \            |\n   +-------------------------------+---------------------------------+\n\
    \   |       subnet prefix           |           interface ID          |\n   +-------------------------------+---------------------------------+\n\
    \                   Figure 1: IPv6 Unicast Address Format\n   For all unicast\
    \ addresses, except those that start with the binary\n   value 000, Interface\
    \ IDs are required to be 64 bits long and to be\n   constructed in Modified EUI-64\
    \ format [RFC4291].  Examples of\n   mechanisms that generate interface identifiers\
    \ without a unique token\n   include Cryptographically Generated Addresses [RFC3972],\
    \ Privacy\n   Addresses [RFC4941], Hash-Based Addresses [HBA], etc.  Non-unique\n\
    \   interface identifiers can also be allocated using managed address\n   assignment\
    \ mechanisms like DHCPv6 (Dynamic Host Configuration\n   Protocol for IPv6) [RFC3315].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Applicability\n   This document applies only to interface identifiers that\
    \ are formed\n   in the modified EUI-64 format as defined in Appendix A of [RFC4291].\n\
    \   All other types of interface identifiers are out of its scope.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Requirements Notation
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Requirements Notation\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Issues with Reusing Reserved Interface Identifiers
  contents:
  - "2.  Issues with Reusing Reserved Interface Identifiers\n   Let us assume a node\
    \ comes up with an interface identifier that has\n   been reserved for use in\
    \ some other capacity, e.g., an IPv6 node that\n   uses temporary IPv6 addresses\
    \ [RFC4941] comes up with an IID of\n   fdff:ffff:ffff:ffff.  This node will receive\
    \ requests from all nodes\n   that are requesting a service from a Mobile IPv6\
    \ home agent since the\n   above-mentioned interface identifier has been reserved\
    \ in [RFC2526]\n   to serve as a MIPv6 home agent's anycast address.  At best,\
    \ this is\n   an annoyance to the node that came up with this address.  At worst,\n\
    \   another node on the link would be denied service and may not look for\n  \
    \ other methods of acquiring a home agent.  Thus, such reserved\n   interface\
    \ identifiers MUST NOT be used for autonomous\n   autoconfiguration or for managed\
    \ address configuration.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Possible Solutions
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Possible Solutions\n   There are two possible ways to go about avoiding\
    \ usage of these\n   reserved interface identifiers.  One of them would be to\
    \ add a\n   normative reference to each specification that reserves an interface\n\
    \   identifier.  The other would be to create an IANA registry for such\n   interface\
    \ identifiers.  There are two disadvantages to the normative\n   reference approach.\
    \  Firstly, this approach does not scale well\n   because the number of such specifications\
    \ that would need to be\n   updated is large.  Secondly, the maturity level of\
    \ the document\n   reserving the IID might be lower than the one prohibited from\
    \ using\n   it; this will cause a downward reference problem.  Therefore, the\n\
    \   better solution is to create an IANA registry for this purpose.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   This document creates an IANA registry for reserved\
    \ IPv6 interface\n   identifiers.  Initial values for the reserved IPv6 interface\n\
    \   identifiers are given below.\n   +-----------------------------------------+-------------------------+\n\

    \                       Table 1: Current Assignments\n   It is possible that implementations\
    \ might predate a specific\n   assignment from this registry and hence not be\
    \ cognizant of the\n   reserved nature of the interface identifier.  Hence, future\n\
    \   assignments from this registry are discouraged.  Future assignments,\n   if\
    \ any, are to be made through Standards Action [RFC5226].\n   Assignments consist\
    \ of a single interface identifier or a range of\n   interface identifiers.\n\
    \   NOTE: The address :: (all zeros in the interface identifier field) is\n  \
    \ used as the unspecified address and ::/0 is used as a default route\n   indicator,\
    \ as specified in [RFC5156].  These uses do not conflict\n   with the reserved\
    \ interface identifiers defined here, since the\n   reserved identifiers defined\
    \ in this document are used for avoiding\n   conflicts with stateless address\
    \ autoconfiguration that utilizes a\n   64-bit prefix length.\n"
