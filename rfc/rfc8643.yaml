- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Opportunistic Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (OSRTP) is an\n\
    \   implementation of the Opportunistic Security mechanism, as defined in\n  \
    \ RFC 7435, applied to the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).  OSRTP\n   allows\
    \ encrypted media to be used in environments where support for\n   encryption\
    \ is not known in advance and is not required.  OSRTP does\n   not require Session\
    \ Description Protocol (SDP) extensions or features\n   and is fully backwards\
    \ compatible with existing implementations using\n   encrypted and authenticated\
    \ media and implementations that do not\n   encrypt or authenticate media packets.\
    \  OSRTP is not specific to any\n   key management technique for Secure RTP (SRTP).\
    \  OSRTP is a\n   transitional approach useful for migrating existing deployments\
    \ of\n   real-time communications to a fully encrypted and authenticated\n   state.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Opportunistic Security (OS) [RFC7435] is an approach to\
    \ security that\n   defines a third mode for security between \"cleartext\" and\n\
    \   \"comprehensive protection\" that allows encryption and authentication\n \
    \  of media to be used if supported but will not result in failures if\n   it\
    \ is not supported.  In the context of the transport of secure media\n   streams\
    \ using RTP and its secured derivatives, cleartext is\n   represented by an RTP\
    \ [RFC3550] media stream that is negotiated with\n   the RTP/AVP (Audio-Visual\
    \ Profile) [RFC3551] or the RTP/AVPF profile\n   [RFC4585], whereas comprehensive\
    \ protection is represented by a\n   Secure RTP [RFC3711] stream negotiated with\
    \ a secure profile, such as\n   SAVP or SAVPF [RFC5124].  OSRTP allows SRTP to\
    \ be negotiated with the\n   RTP/AVP profile, with fallback to RTP if SRTP is\
    \ not supported.\n   There have been some extensions to SDP to allow profiles\
    \ to be\n   negotiated, such as SDP Capabilities Negotiation (SDPCapNeg)\n   [RFC5939].\
    \  However, these approaches are complex and have very\n   limited deployment\
    \ in communication systems.  Other key management\n   protocols for SRTP that\
    \ have been developed, such as ZRTP [RFC6189],\n   use OS by design.  This approach\
    \ for OSRTP is based on [Kaplan06]\n   where it was called \"best effort SRTP\"\
    .  [Kaplan06] has a full\n   discussion of the motivation and requirements for\
    \ opportunistic\n   secure media.\n   OSRTP uses the presence of SRTP keying-related\
    \ attributes in an SDP\n   offer to indicate support for opportunistic secure\
    \ media.  The\n   presence of SRTP keying-related attributes in the SDP answer\n\
    \   indicates that the other party also supports OSRTP and that encrypted\n  \
    \ and authenticated media will be used.  OSRTP requires no additional\n   extensions\
    \ to SDP or new attributes and is defined independently of\n   the key agreement\
    \ mechanism used.  OSRTP is only usable when media is\n   negotiated using the\
    \ Offer/Answer protocol [RFC3264].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Applicability Statement\n   OSRTP is a transitional approach that provides\
    \ a migration path from\n   unencrypted communication (RTP) to fully encrypted\
    \ communication\n   (SRTP).  It is only to be used in existing deployments that\
    \ are\n   attempting to transition to fully secure communications.  New\n   applications\
    \ and new deployments will not use OSRTP.\n"
- title: 2.  Requirements Language
  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear\
    \ in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"
- title: 3.  SDP Offer/Answer Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  SDP Offer/Answer Considerations\n   This section defines the SDP offer/answer\
    \ considerations for\n   opportunistic security.\n   The procedures are for a\
    \ specific \"m=\" section describing RTP-based\n   media.  If an SDP offer or\
    \ answer contains multiple such \"m=\"\n   sections, the procedures are applied\
    \ to each \"m=\" section\n   individually.\n   \"Initial OSRTP offer\" refers\
    \ to the offer in which opportunistic\n   security is offered for an \"m=\" section\
    \ for the first time within an\n   SDP session.\n   It is important to note that\
    \ OSRTP makes no changes to and has no\n   effect on media sessions in which the\
    \ offer contains a secure profile\n   of RTP, such as SAVP or SAVPF.  As discussed\
    \ in [RFC7435], that is\n   the \"comprehensive protection\" for media mode.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Generating the Initial OSRTP Offer
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Generating the Initial OSRTP Offer\n   To indicate support for OSRTP in\
    \ an SDP offer, the offerer uses the\n   RTP/AVP profile [RFC3551] or the RTP/AVPF\
    \ profile [RFC4585] but\n   includes SRTP keying attributes.  OSRTP is not specific\
    \ to any key\n   management technique for SRTP, and multiple key management techniques\n\
    \   can be included on the SDP offer.  For example:\n      If the offerer supports\
    \ DTLS-SRTP key agreement [RFC5763], then an\n      \"a=fingerprint\" attribute\
    \ will be present.  Or:\n      If the offerer supports SDP Security Descriptions\
    \ key agreement\n      [RFC4568], then an \"a=crypto\" attribute will be present.\
    \  Or:\n      If the offerer supports ZRTP key agreement [RFC6189], then an\n\
    \      \"a=zrtp-hash\" attribute will be present.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Generating the Answer
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Generating the Answer\n   To accept OSRTP, an answerer receiving an offer\
    \ indicating support\n   for OSRTP generates an SDP answer containing SRTP keying\
    \ attributes\n   that match one of the keying methods in the offer.  The answer\
    \ MUST\n   NOT contain attributes from more than one keying method, even if the\n\
    \   offer contained multiple keying method attributes.  The selected SRTP\n  \
    \ key management approach is followed, and SRTP media is used for this\n   session.\
    \  If the SRTP key management fails for any reason, the media\n   session MUST\
    \ fail.  To decline OSRTP, the answerer generates an SDP\n   answer omitting SRTP\
    \ keying attributes, and the media session\n   proceeds with RTP with no encryption\
    \ or authentication used.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Offerer Processing the Answer
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Offerer Processing the Answer\n   If the offerer of OSRTP receives an SDP\
    \ answer that does not contain\n   SRTP keying attributes, then the media session\
    \ proceeds with RTP.  If\n   the SDP answer contains SRTP keying attributes, then\
    \ the associated\n   SRTP key management approach is followed and SRTP media is\
    \ used for\n   this session.  If the SRTP key management fails, the media session\n\
    \   MUST fail.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Modifying the Session
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Modifying the Session\n   When an offerer generates a subsequent SDP offer,\
    \ it should do so\n   following the principles of [RFC6337], meaning that the\
    \ decision to\n   create the new SDP offer should not be influenced by what was\n\
    \   previously negotiated.  For example, if a previous OSRTP offer did\n   not\
    \ result in SRTP being established, the offerer may try again and\n   generate\
    \ a new OSRTP offer as specified in Section 3.1.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of [RFC4568] apply\
    \ to OSRTP, as well as\n   the security considerations of the particular SRTP\
    \ key agreement\n   approach used.  However, the authentication requirements of\
    \ a\n   particular SRTP key agreement approach are relaxed when that key\n   agreement\
    \ is used with OSRTP, which is consistent with the\n   Opportunistic Security\
    \ approach described in [RFC7435].  For example:\n      For DTLS-SRTP key agreement\
    \ [RFC5763], an authenticated signaling\n      channel does not need to be used\
    \ with OSRTP if it is not\n      available.\n      For SDP Security Descriptions\
    \ key agreement [RFC4568], an\n      authenticated signaling channel does not\
    \ need to be used with\n      OSRTP if it is not available, although an encrypted\
    \ signaling\n      channel MUST still be used.\n      For ZRTP key agreement [RFC6189],\
    \ the security considerations are\n      unchanged, since ZRTP does not rely on\
    \ the security of the\n      signaling channel.\n   While OSRTP does not require\
    \ authentication of the key agreement\n   mechanism, it does need to avoid exposing\
    \ SRTP keys to eavesdroppers,\n   since this could enable passive attacks against\
    \ SRTP.  Section 8.3 of\n   [RFC4568] requires that any messages that contain\
    \ SRTP keys be\n   encrypted, and further says that encryption SHOULD provide\
    \ end-to-end\n   confidentiality protection if intermediaries that could inspect\
    \ the\n   SDP message are present.  At the time of this writing, it is\n   understood\
    \ that the requirement in [RFC4568] for end-to-end\n   confidentiality protection\
    \ is commonly ignored.  Therefore, if OSRTP\n   is used with SDP Security Descriptions,\
    \ any such intermediaries\n   (e.g., SIP proxies) must be assumed to have access\
    \ to the SRTP keys.\n   As discussed in [RFC7435], OSRTP is used in cases where\
    \ support for\n   encryption by the other party is not known in advance and is\
    \ not\n   required.  For cases where it is known that the other party supports\n\
    \   SRTP or SRTP needs to be used, OSRTP MUST NOT be used.  Instead, a\n   secure\
    \ profile of RTP is used in the offer.\n"
