- title: 2.  Process Description
  contents:
  - "2.  Process Description\n   The process to be described here has been adopted\
    \ from a previous\n   evaluation in IETF [RFC3127].  The CAPWAP objectives in\
    \ RFC 4564\n   [OBJ] were used to set the scope and direction for the evaluators\
    \ and\n   was the primary source of requirements.  However, the evaluation team\n\
    \   also used their expert knowledge and professional experience to\n   consider\
    \ how well a candidate protocol met the working group\n   objectives.\n   For\
    \ each of the 4 candidate protocols, the evaluation document editor\n   assigned\
    \ 2 team members to write evaluation briefs.  One member was\n   assigned to write\
    \ a \"Pro\" brief and could take a generous\n   interpretation of the proposal;\
    \ this evaluator could grant benefit of\n   doubt.  A second evaluator was assigned\
    \ to write a \"Con\" brief and\n   was required to use strict criteria when performing\
    \ the evaluation.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Ratings
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Ratings\n   The \"Pro\" and \"Con\" members independently evaluated how\
    \ well the\n   candidate protocol met each objective.  Each objective was scored\
    \ as\n   an 'F' for failure, 'P' for partial, or 'C' for completely meeting\n\
    \   the objective.\n   F - Failure to Comply\n   The evaluation team believes\
    \ the proposal does not meet the\n   objective.  This could be due to the proposal\
    \ completely missing any\n   functionality towards the objective.  A proposal\
    \ could also receive\n   an 'F' for improperly implementing the objective.\n \
    \  P - Partial Compliance\n   The proposal has some functionality that addresses\
    \ the objective, but\n   it is incomplete or ambiguous.\n   C - Compliant\n  \
    \ The proposal fully specifies functionality meeting the objective.\n   The specification\
    \ must be detailed enough that interoperable\n   implementations are likely from\
    \ reading the proposal alone.  If the\n   method is ambiguous or particularly\
    \ complex, an explanation, use\n   cases, or even diagrams may need to be supplied\
    \ in order to receive a\n   compliant rating.\n   The 4-person evaluation team\
    \ held a teleconference for each candidate\n   to discuss the briefs.  One of\
    \ the working group chairs was also\n   present at the meeting in an advisory\
    \ capacity.  Each evaluator\n   presented a brief with supporting details.  The\
    \ team discussed the\n   issues and delivered a team rating for each objective.\
    \  These\n   discussions are documented in the meeting minutes.  The team ratings\n\
    \   are used for the compliance evaluation.\n   The candidate protocols were scored\
    \ only on the information written\n   in their draft.  This means that a particular\
    \ protocol might actually\n   meet the specifics of a requirement, but if the\
    \ proposal did not\n   state, describe, or reference how that requirement was\
    \ met, it might\n   be scored lower.\n"

- title: 4.  Protocol Proposals and Highlights
  contents:
  - "4.  Protocol Proposals and Highlights\n   The following proposals were submitted\
    \ as proposals to the CAPWAP\n   working group.\n"
- title: 4.1.  LWAPP
  contents:
  - "4.1.  LWAPP\n   The \"Light Weight Access Point Protocol\" [LWAPP] was the first\
    \ CAPWAP\n   protocol originally submitted to Seamoby Working Group.  LWAPP\n\
    \   proposes original solutions for authentication and user data\n   encapsulation\
    \ as well as management and configuration information\n   elements.  LWAPP originated\
    \ as a \"split MAC\" protocol, but recent\n   changes have added local MAC support\
    \ as well.  LWAPP has received a\n   security review from Charles Clancy of the\
    \ University of Maryland\n   Information Systems Security Lab.\n   LWAPP is the\
    \ most detailed CAPWAP proposal.  It provides a thorough\n   specification of\
    \ the discovery, security, and system management\n   methods.  LWAPP focuses on\
    \ the 802.11 WLAN-specific monitoring and\n   configuration.  A key feature of\
    \ LWAPP is its use of raw 802.11\n   frames that are tunneled back to the Access\
    \ Controller (AC) for\n   processing.  In both local- and split-MAC modes, raw\
    \ 802.11 frames\n   are forwarded to the AC for management and control.  In addition,\
    \ in\n   split-MAC mode, user data is tunneled in raw 802.11 form to the AC.\n\
    \   While in concept, LWAPP could be used for other wireless\n   technologies,\
    \ LWAPP defines very few primitives that are independent\n   of the 802.11 layer.\n"
- title: 4.2.  SLAPP
  contents:
  - "4.2.  SLAPP\n   \"Secure Light Access Point Protocol\" [SLAPP] distinguishes\
    \ itself\n   with the use of well-known, established technologies such as Generic\n\
    \   Routing Encapsulation (GRE) for user data tunneling between the AC\n   and\
    \ Wireless Termination Point (WTP) and the proposed standard\n   Datagram Transport\
    \ Layer Security [DTLS] for the control channel\n   transport.\n   4 modes of\
    \ operation are supported, 2 local-MAC modes and 2 split-MAC\n   modes.  STA control\
    \ may be performed by the AC using native 802.11\n   frames that are encapsulated\
    \ in SLAPP control packets across all\n   modes. (STA refers to a wireless station,\
    \ typically a laptop.)\n   In SLAPP local-MAC modes, user data frames may be bridged\
    \ or tunneled\n   back using GRE to the AC as 802.3 frames.  In the split-MAC\
    \ modes,\n   user data is always tunneled back to the AC as native 802.11 frames.\n\
    \   Encryption of user data may be performed at either the AC or the WTP\n   in\
    \ split-MAC mode.\n"
- title: 4.3.  CTP
  contents:
  - "4.3.  CTP\n   \"CAPWAP Tunneling Protocol\" [CTP] distinguishes itself with its\
    \ use\n   of Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to define configuration\n\
    \   and management data that it then encapsulates in an encrypted control\n  \
    \ channel.  CTP was originally designed as a local-MAC protocol but the\n   new\
    \ version has split-MAC support as well.  In addition, CTP is\n   clearly designed\
    \ from the beginning to be compatible with multiple\n   wireless technologies.\n\
    \   CTP defines information elements for management and control between\n   the\
    \ AC and WTP.  CTP control messages are specified for STA session\n   state, configuration,\
    \ and statistics.\n   In local-MAC mode, CTP does not forward any native wireless\
    \ frames to\n   the AC.  CTP specifies control messages for STA session activity,\n\
    \   mobility, and radio frequency (RF) resource management between the AC\n  \
    \ and WTP.  CTP local-MAC mode specifies that the integration function\n   from\
    \ the wireless network to 802.3 Ethernet is performed at the WTP\n   for all user\
    \ data.  User data may either be bridged at the WTP or\n   encapsulated as 802.3\
    \ frames in CTP packets at the WTP and tunneled\n   to the AC.\n   CTP's split-MAC\
    \ mode is defined as an extension to local-MAC mode.\n   In CTP's version of split-MAC\
    \ operation, wireless management frames\n   are forwarded in their raw format\
    \ to the AC.  User data frames may be\n   bridged locally at the WTP, or they\
    \ may be encapsulated in CTP\n   packets and tunneled in their native wireless\
    \ form to the AC.\n   CTP supplies STA control abstraction, methods for extending\
    \ the\n   forwarding of multiple types of native wireless management frames,\n\
    \   and many options for user data tunneling.  Configuration management\n   is\
    \ an extension of SNMP.  This makes CTP one of the most flexible of\n   the proposed\
    \ CAPWAP protocols.  However, it does define new security\n   and data tunneling\
    \ mechanisms instead of leveraging existing\n   standards.\n"
- title: 4.4.  WiCoP
  contents:
  - "4.4.  WiCoP\n   \"Wireless LAN Control Protocol\" [WICOP] introduces new discovery,\n\
    \   configuration, and management of Wireless LAN (WLAN) systems.  The\n   protocol\
    \ defines a distinct discovery mechanism that integrates WTP-\n   AC capabilities\
    \ negotiation.\n   WiCoP defines 802.11 Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. \
    \ In\n   addition, the protocol proposes to use standard security and\n   authentication\
    \ methods such as IPsec and Extensible Authentication\n   Protocol (EAP).  The\
    \ protocol needs to go into detail with regards to\n   explicit use of the above-mentioned\
    \ methods.  To ensure interoperable\n   protocol implementations, it is critical\
    \ to provide users with\n   detailed unambiguous specification.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Each of the candidate protocols has a Security\
    \ Considerations\n   section, as well as security properties.  The CAPWAP objectives\n\
    \   document [OBJ] contains security-related requirements.  The\n   evaluation\
    \ team has considered if and how the candidate protocols\n   implement the security\
    \ features required by the CAPWAP objectives.\n   However, this evaluation team\
    \ is not a security team and has not\n   performed a thorough security evaluation\
    \ or tests.  Any protocol\n   coming out of the CAPWAP working group must undergo\
    \ an IETF security\n   review in order to fully meet the objectives.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.1.  Logical Groups\n   LWAPP:C, SLAPP:C, CTP:C, WiCoP:C\n   LWAPP\n   LWAPP\
    \ provides a control message called \"Add WLAN\".  This message is\n   used by\
    \ the AC to create a WLAN with a unique ID, i.e., its Service\n   Set Identifier\
    \ (SSID).  The WTPs in this WLAN have their own Basic\n   Service Set Identifiers\
    \ (BSSIDs).  LWAPP meets this objective.\n   SLAPP\n   SLAPP explicitly supports\
    \ 0-255 BSSIDs.\n   CTP\n   CTP implements a NETWORK_ID attribute that allows\
    \ a wireless-\n   technology-independent way of creating logical groups.  CTP\
    \ meets\n   this objective.\n   WiCoP\n   WiCoP provides control tunnels to manage\
    \ logical groups.  There is\n   one control tunnel for each logical group.  WiCoP\
    \ meets this\n   objective.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Traffic Separation
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Traffic Separation\n   LWAPP:C, SLAPP:C, CTP:P, WiCoP:P\n   If a protocol\
    \ distinguishes a data message from a control message,\n   then it meets this\
    \ objective.\n   LWAPP\n   LWAPP separates control messages from data messages\
    \ using \"C-bit\".\n   \"C-bit\" is defined in the LWAPP transport header.  When\
    \ C-bit is\n   equal to zero, the message is a data message.  When C-bit is equal\
    \ to\n   one, the message is a control message.  So, LWAPP meets this\n   objective.\n\
    \   SLAPP\n   The SLAPP protocol encapsulates control using DTLS and optionally,\n\
    \   user data with GRE.  Of particular note, SLAPP defines 4\n   \"architecture\
    \ modes\" that define how user data is handled in relation\n   to the AC.  SLAPP\
    \ is compliant with this objective.\n   CTP\n   CTP defines separate packet frame\
    \ types for control and data.\n   However, the evaluation team could not find\
    \ a way to configure the\n   tunneling of user data, so it opted to rate CTP as\
    \ only partially\n   compliant.  It appears that CTP would rely on SNMP MIB Object\n\
    \   Identifiers (OIDs) for this function, but none were defined in the\n   specification.\
    \  Defining the necessary OIDs would make CTP fully\n   compliant.\n   WiCoP\n\
    \   WiCoP provides for separation between control and data channels.\n   However,\
    \ tunneling methods are not explicitly described.  Because of\n   this, WiCoP\
    \ partially meets this objective.\n"
- title: 6.3.  STA Transparency
  contents:
  - "6.3.  STA Transparency\n   LWAPP:C, SLAPP:C, CTP:C, WiCoP:C\n   If a protocol\
    \ does not indicate that STA needs to know about the\n   protocol, then this objective\
    \ is met.\n   The protocol must not define any message formats between STA and\n\
    \   WTP/AC.\n   LWAPP\n   LWAPP does not require a STA to be aware of LWAPP. \
    \ No messages or\n   protocol primitives are defined that the STA must interact\
    \ with\n   beyond the 802.11 standard.  LWAPP is fully compliant.\n   SLAPP\n\
    \   SLAPP places no requirements on STA network elements.  No messages or\n  \
    \ protocol primitives are defined that the STA must interact with\n   beyond the\

- title: 6.4.  Configuration Consistency
  contents:
  - "6.4.  Configuration Consistency\n   LWAPP:C, SLAPP:C, CTP:C, WiCoP:C\n   Given\
    \ the objective of maintaining configurations for a large number\n   of network\
    \ elements involved in 802.11 wireless networks, the\n   evaluation team would\
    \ like to recommend that a token, key, or serial\n   number for configuration\
    \ be implemented for configuration\n   verification.\n   LWAPP\n   It is possible\
    \ to obtain and verify all configurable values through\n   LWAPP.  Notably, LWAPP\
    \ takes an approach that only \"non-default\"\n   settings (defaults are specified\
    \ by LWAPP) are necessary for\n   transmission when performing configuration consistency\
    \ checks.  This\n   behavior is explicitly specified in LWAPP.  LWAPP is compliant\
    \ with\n   this objective.\n   SLAPP\n   Numerous events and statistics are available\
    \ to report configuration\n   changes and WTP state.  SLAPP does not have any\
    \ built-in abilities to\n   minimize or optimize configuration consistency verification,\
    \ but it\n   is compliant with the objective.\n   CTP\n   CTP's use of SNMP makes\
    \ configuration consistency checking\n   straightforward.  Where specified in\
    \ a MIB, one could take advantage\n   of default values.\n   WICOP\n   The WiCoP\
    \ configuration starts with exchange of capability messages\n   between the WTP\
    \ and AC.  Next, configuration control data is sent to\n   the WTP.\n   WiCoP\
    \ defines configuration values in groups of configuration data\n   messages. \
    \ In addition, the protocol supports configuration using MIB\n   objects.  To\
    \ maintain data consistency, each configuration message\n   from the AC is acknowledged\
    \ by the WTP.\n"
- title: 6.5.  Firmware Trigger
  contents:
  - "6.5.  Firmware Trigger\n   LWAPP:P, SLAPP:P, CTP:P, WiCoP:C\n   The evaluation\
    \ team considered the objective and determined that for\n   full compliance, the\
    \ protocol state machine must support the ability\n   to initiate the process\
    \ for checking and performing a firmware update\n   independently of other functions.\n\
    \   Many protocols perform a firmware check and update procedure only on\n   system\
    \ startup time.  This method received a partial compliance.  The\n   team believed\
    \ that performing the firmware check only at startup time\n   was unnecessarily\
    \ limiting and that allowing it to occur at any time\n   in the state machine\
    \ did not increase complexity of the protocol.\n   Allowing the firmware update\
    \ process to be initiated during the\n   running state allows more possibilities\
    \ for minimizing downtime of\n   the WTP during the firmware update process.\n\
    \   For example, the firmware check and download of the image over the\n   network\
    \ could potentially occur while the WTP was in a running state.\n   After the\
    \ file transfer was complete, the WTP could be rebooted just\n   once and begin\
    \ running the new firmware image.  This could pose a\n   meaningful reduction\
    \ in downtime when the firmware image is large,\n   the link for loading the file\
    \ is very slow, or the WTP reboot time is\n   long.\n   A protocol would only\
    \ fail compliance if no method was specified for\n   updating of firmware.\n \

    \ approach is novel because it leverages\n   the use of standard SNMP.\n   Section\

  contents:
  - "6.7.  Resource Control\n   LWAPP:C, SLAPP:P, CTP:P, WiCoP:P\n   The evaluation\
    \ team interpreted the resource control objective to\n   mean that the CAPWAP\
    \ protocol must map 802.11e QoS markings to the\n   wired network.  This mapping\
    \ must include any encapsulation or\n   tunneling of user data defined by the\
    \ CAPWAP protocol.  Of particular\n   note, the evaluation team agreed that the\
    \ CAPWAP protocol should\n   supply an explicit capability to configure this mapping.\
    \  Since most\n   of the protocols relied only on the 802.11e statically defined\n\
    \   mapping, most received a partial compliance.\n   LWAPP\n   LWAPP defines its\
    \ own custom TLV structure, which consists of an\n   8-bit type or class of information\
    \ value and an additional 8-bit\n   value that indexes to a specific variable.\n\
    \   LWAPP allows the mobile station-based QoS configuration in each Add\n   Mobile\
    \ Request sent by AC to WTP for each new mobile station that is\n   attached.\
    \  Packet prioritization is left to individual WTPs. 4\n   different QoS policies\
    \ for each station to enforce can be configured.\n   Update Mobile QoS message\
    \ element can be used to change QoS policy at\n   the WTP for a given mobile station.\
    \  LWAPP should support 8 QoS\n   policies as this matches 802.11e 802.1p and\
    \ IP TOS, but for this\n   objective, 4 classes is compliant.\n   Overall, LWAPP\
    \ conforms to the resource control objective.  It\n   enables QoS configuration\
    \ and mapping.  The control can be applied on\n   a logical group basis and also\
    \ enables the wireless traffic to be\n   flexibly mapped to the wired segment.\n\
    \   SLAPP\n   Although 802.11e specifies 802.1p and Differentiated Service Code\n\
    \   Point (DSCP) mappings, there is no explicit support for 802.11e in\n   SLAPP.\
    \  SLAPP must be updated to add 802.11e as one of the standard\n   capabilities\
    \ that a WTP could support and specify a mechanism that\n   would allow configuration\
    \ of mapping the QoS classes.\n   CTP\n   CTP requires that the WTP and AC copy\
    \ the QoS marking of user data to\n   the data message encapsulation.  This mapping\
    \ is accomplished by the\n   CTP Header's 1-byte policy field.  However, no configuration\
    \ of QoS\n   mapping other than copying the user data's already existing markings\n\
    \   is defined in CTP.  It seems clear that SNMP could be used to\n   configure\
    \ the mapping to occur differently, but no OIDs are defined\n   that would enable\
    \ this.  Partial compliance is assigned to CTP for\n   this objective.\n   WiCoP\n\
    \   Note: WiCoP rating for resource control objectives has been upgraded\n   from\
    \ Failed to Partial.  After an additional review of the WiCoP\n   protocol proposal,\
    \ it was determined that the protocol partially\n   meets resource control objectives.\n\
    \   WiCoP protocol starts its QoS configuration with 802.11e capability\n   exchange\
    \ between the WTP and AC.  The QoS capabilities primitives are\n   included in\
    \ the capability messages.\n   WiCoP defines the QoS-Value message that contains\
    \ 802.11e\n   configuration parameters.  This is sent for each group supported\
    \ by\n   the WTP.  WiCoP does not provide an explicit method for configuration\n\
    \   of DSCP tags and 802.1P precedence values.  It is possible to\n   configure\
    \ these parameters through SNMP OID configuration method, but\n   WiCoP does not\
    \ explicitly identify any specific MIBs.  Overall, WiCoP\n   partially meets resource\
    \ control CAPWAP objectives.  In order to be\n   fully compliant with the given\
    \ objective, the protocol needs to\n   identify a clear method to configure 802.1p\

  - "9.  Protocol Recommendation\n   The proposals presented offer a variety of novel\
    \ features that\n   together would deliver a full-featured, flexible, and extensible\n\
    \   CAPWAP protocol.  The most novel of these features leverage existing\n   standards\
    \ where feasible.  It is this evaluation team's opinion that\n   a mix of the\
    \ capabilities of the proposals will produce the best\n   CAPWAP protocol.\n \
    \  The recommended features are described below.  Many of these novel\n   capabilities\
    \ come from CTP and SLAPP and WiCoP.  However, LWAPP has\n   the most complete\
    \ base protocol and is flexible enough to be extended\n   or modified by the working\
    \ group.  We therefore recommend that LWAPP\n   be used as the basis for the CAPWAP\
    \ protocol.\n   The evaluation team recommends that the working group carefully\n\
    \   consider the following issues and recommended changes.  The\n   evaluation\
    \ team believes that a more complete CAPWAP protocol will be\n   delivered by\
    \ addressing these issues and changes.\n"

  contents:
  - "9.1.2.  Control Channel Security\n   LWAPP's security mechanisms appear satisfactory\
    \ and could serve\n   CAPWAP going forward.  However, the evaluation team recommends\n\
    \   adoption of a standard security protocol for the control channel.\n   There\
    \ are several motivations for a standards-based security\n   protocol, but the\
    \ primary disadvantage of a new security protocol is\n   that it will take longer\
    \ and be more difficult to standardize than\n   reusing an existing IETF standard.\
    \  First, a new security protocol\n   will face a longer, slower approval processes\
    \ from the Security Area\n   Directorate and the IESG.  The new CAPWAP security\
    \ protocol will need\n   to pass several tests including the following:\n   What\
    \ is uniquely required by CAPWAP that is not available from an\n   existing standard\
    \ protocol?  How will CAPWAP's security protocol meet\n   security area requirements\
    \ for extensibility, such as the ability to\n   support future cipher suites and\
    \ new key exchange methods?  How does\n   this ability compare to established\
    \ security protocols that have\n   these capabilities?\n   Points such as these\
    \ are continually receiving more attention in the\n   industry and in the IETF.\
    \  Extensibility of key exchange methods and\n   cipher suites are becoming industry\
    \ standard best practices.  These\n   issues are important topics in the IETF\
    \ Security Area Advisory Group\n   (SAAG) and the SecMech BOF, held during the\
    \ 63rd IETF meeting.\n   These issues could be nullified by adopting an appropriate\
    \ existing\n   standard security protocol.  IPsec or DTLS could be a standards\n\
    \   alternative to LWAPP's specification.  DTLS presents a UDP variant of\n  \
    \ Transport Layer Security (TLS).  Although DTLS is relatively new, TLS\n   is\
    \ a heavily used, tried-and-tested security protocol.\n   The evaluation team\
    \ recommends that whatever security protocol is\n   specified for CAPWAP, its\
    \ use cases must be described in detail.\n   LWAPP does a good job of this with\
    \ its proposed, proprietary method.\n   If an updated specification is developed,\
    \ it should contain at least\n   one mandatory authentication and cipher method.\
    \  For example, pre-\n   shared key and x.509 certificates could be specified\
    \ as mandatory\n   authentication methods, and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)\n\
    \   Counter Mode with CBC-MAC Protocol (CCMP) could be selected as a\n   mandatory\
    \ cipher.\n   Given the possibilities for code reuse, industry reliance on TLS,\
    \ and\n   the future for TLS, DTLS may be a wise alternative to a security\n \
    \  method specific to CAPWAP.  In addition, use of DTLS would likely\n   expedite\
    \ the approval of CAPWAP as a proposed standard over the use\n   of CAPWAP-specific\
    \ security mechanisms.\n"

- title: 9.1.3.1.  Support for Local MAC User Data Tunneling
  contents:
  - "9.1.3.1.  Support for Local MAC User Data Tunneling\n   The issue of data encapsulation\
    \ is closely related to the split- and\n   local-MAC architectures.  The split-MAC\
    \ architecture requires some\n   form of data tunneling.  All the proposals except\
    \ LWAPP offer a\n   method of tunneling in local-MAC mode as well.  By local-MAC\
    \ data\n   tunneling, we mean the tunneling of user data as 802.3 Ethernet\n \
    \  frames back to the AC from a WTP that is otherwise in local-MAC mode.\n   Tunneling\
    \ data in local-MAC mode offers the ability for implementers\n   to innovate in\
    \ several ways even while using a local-MAC\n   architecture.  For example, functions\
    \ such as mobility, flexible user\n   data encryption options, and fast handoffs\
    \ can be enabled through\n   tunneling of user data back to an AC, or as LWAPP\
    \ defines, a data\n   termination endpoint, which could be different from the\
    \ AC.  In\n   addition, there are special QoS or application-aware treatments\
    \ of\n   user data packets such as voice or video.  Improved transparency and\n\
    \   compatibility with future wireless technologies are also possible\n   when\
    \ encapsulating user data in a common format, such as 802.3,\n   between the access\
    \ point and the AC or other termination point in the\n   network.\n   Another\
    \ possibility is when a native wireless MAC changes in the\n   future, if a new\
    \ WTP that supports this MAC change can also support a\n   wireless MAC -> 802.3\
    \ integration function, then the wireless MAC\n   layer change may remain transparent\
    \ to an AC and still maintain many\n   of the benefits that data tunneling can\
    \ bring.\n   LWAPP does support a header for tunneled user data that contains\n\
    \   layer 1 wireless information (Received Signal Strength Indication\n   (RSSI)\
    \ and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)) that is independent of the\n   wireless layer\
    \ 2 MAC.  Innovations related to the use of RSSI and SNR\n   at the AC may be\
    \ retained even when tunneling 802.3 user data across\n   different wireless MACs.\n\
    \   It is likely that many other features could be created by innovative\n   implementers\
    \ using this method.  However, LWAPP narrowly defines the\n   local-MAC architecture\
    \ to exclude an option of tunneling data frames\n   back to the AC.  Given the\
    \ broad support for tunneling 802.3 data\n   frames between the WTP and AC across\
    \ all the proposals and existing\n   proprietary industry implementations, the\
    \ evaluation team strongly\n   recommends that the working group consider a data\
    \ tunneling mode for\n   local-MAC be added to the LWAPP proposal and become part\
    \ of the\n   standard CAPWAP protocol.\n"
- title: 9.1.3.2.  Mandatory and Optional Tunneling Modes
  contents:
  - "9.1.3.2.  Mandatory and Optional Tunneling Modes\n   If more than one tunneling\
    \ mode is part of the CAPWAP protocol, the\n   evaluation team recommends that\
    \ the working group choose one method\n   as mandatory and other methods as optional.\
    \  In addition, the CAPWAP\n   protocol must implement the ability to negotiate\
    \ which tunneling\n   methods are supported through a capabilities exchange. \
    \ This allows\n   ACs and WTPs freedom to implement a variety of modes but always\
    \ have\n   the option of falling back to a common mode.\n   The choice of which\
    \ mode(s) should be mandatory is an important\n   decision and may impact many\
    \ decisions implementers have to make with\n   their hardware and software choices\
    \ for both WTPs and ACs.  The\n   evaluation team believes that the working group\
    \ should address this\n   issue of local-MAC data tunneling and carefully choose\
    \ which mode(s)\n   should be mandatory.\n"

- title: 9.2.1.  Access Control
  contents:
  - "9.2.1.  Access Control\n   Abstraction of STA access control, such as that implemented\
    \ in CTP\n   and WiCoP, stands out as a valuable feature as it is fundamental\
    \ to\n   the operational capabilities of many types of wireless networks, not\n\
    \   just 802.11.  LWAPP implements station access control as an 802.11-\n   specific\
    \ function via forwarding of 802.11 control frames to the\n   access controller.\
    \  LWAPP has abstracted the STA Delete function out\n   of the 802.11 binding.\
    \  However, the Add STA function is part of the\n   802.11 binding.  It would\
    \ be useful to implement the wireless MAC\n   independent functions for adding\
    \ a STA outside of the 802.11 binding.\n"

    \ specifies layer 2 and layer 3 methods for data\n   tunneling.  The evaluation\
    \ team believes that the layer 2 method is\n   redundant to the layer 3 method.\
    \  The team recommends that the layer\n   2 method encapsulation be removed from\
    \ the LWAPP protocol.\n"
- title: 9.2.3.  Data Encapsulation Standard
  contents:
  - "9.2.3.  Data Encapsulation Standard\n   LWAPP's layer 3 data encapsulation meets\
    \ the working group\n   objectives.  However, the evaluation team recommends the\
    \ use of a\n   standards-based protocol for encapsulation of user data between\
    \ the\n   WTP and AC.  GRE or Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) could make good\n\
    \   candidates as standards-based encapsulation protocols for data\n   tunneling.\n\
    \   Using a standard gives the opportunity for code reuse, whether it is\n   off-the-shelf\
    \ microcode for processors, code modules that can be\n   purchased for real-time\
    \ operating systems, or open-source\n   implementations for Unix-based systems.\
    \  In addition, L2TP and GRE\n   are designed to encapsulate multiple data types,\
    \ increasing\n   flexibility for supporting future wireless technologies.\n"
