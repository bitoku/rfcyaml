  - "Abstract\n   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) has an attribute that allows\n\

    \ RTCP port associated with the SSM session\n   itself cannot be specified by\
    \ the same attribute to avoid ambiguity,\n   and thus, is required to be derived\
    \ from the \"m=\" line of the media\n   description.  Deriving the RTCP port from\
    \ the \"m=\" line imposes an\n   unnecessary restriction.  This document removes\
    \ this restriction by\n   introducing a new SDP attribute.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] has an\
    \ attribute\n   that allows RTP applications [RFC3550] to specify an address and\
    \ a\n   port associated with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) traffic\n   [RFC3605].\
    \  This attribute is called 'rtcp'.\n   Now consider a network where one or more\
    \ media senders send RTP\n   packets to a distribution source, which then multicasts\
    \ these RTP\n   packets to multicast receivers using a source-specific multicast\n\
    \   (SSM) arrangement [RFC5760].  The distribution source also multicasts\n  \
    \ the forward RTCP traffic (i.e., RTCP sender reports and receiver\n   reports\
    \ or their summaries) to the receivers in the same SSM session.\n   In RTP-based\
    \ SSM sessions, the 'rtcp' attribute is used to designate\n   the address and\
    \ the RTCP port of the Feedback Target in the SDP\n   description [RFC5760]. \
    \ However, the RTCP port associated with the\n   SSM session itself cannot be\
    \ specified by the same attribute since it\n   could potentially cause ambiguity.\
    \  Thus, the multicast RTCP port is\n   required to be derived from the \"m=\"\
    \ line of the media description\n   (see Section 10.2 of [RFC5760]) by following\
    \ the +1 rule (see Section\n   11 of [RFC3550]).  However, [RFC3550] lifted the\
    \ requirement for the\n   +1 rule since it imposed an unnecessary restriction\
    \ on RTCP port\n   selection.\n   In this specification, we introduce a new SDP\
    \ attribute to remove\n   this restriction.  The new attribute allows the multicast\
    \ sender to\n   use its desired port in the RTCP session.  This document updates\n\
    \   [RFC5760].\n"
- title: 2.  The 'multicast-rtcp' Attribute
  contents:
  - "2.  The 'multicast-rtcp' Attribute\n   In RTP-based SSM sessions, the distribution\
    \ source can use different\n   multicast RTP and RTCP ports to send the RTP and\
    \ RTCP packets,\n   respectively.  Alternatively, the distribution source can\
    \ use RTP/\n   RTCP port muxing [RFC5761], in which case the RTP and RTCP packets\n\
    \   are sent to the same destination port in the SSM session.\n   For the cases\
    \ when the distribution source does not want to use the\n   one higher port for\
    \ the RTCP traffic, this document defines a new SDP\n   attribute, called 'multicast-rtcp'.\
    \  By using this attribute, the\n   distribution source uses a desired port for\
    \ the SSM RTCP session.  In\n   the absence of the 'multicast-rtcp' attribute,\
    \ the +1 rule applies\n   following [RFC5760].\n   The following ABNF [RFC5234]\
    \ syntax formally describes the\n   'multicast-rtcp' attribute:\n            \
    \   rtcp-attribute = \"a=multicast-rtcp:\" port CRLF\n         Figure 1: ABNF\
    \ syntax for the 'multicast-rtcp' attribute\n   Here, the 'port' token is defined\
    \ as specified in Section 9 of\n   [RFC4566].\n   The 'multicast-rtcp' attribute\
    \ is defined as both a media-level and\n   session-level attribute.  Except where\
    \ stated otherwise in this\n   document, the rules of [RFC3550] apply.\n"

    \  198.51.100.1) to the multicast destination address of 233.252.0.2 and\n   port\
    \ 41000.  The forward RTCP traffic is multicast in the same\n   multicast group\

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The 'multicast-rtcp' attribute is not believed\
    \ to introduce any\n   significant security risk to multimedia applications. \
    \ A malevolent\n   third party could use this attribute to redirect the RTCP traffic,\n\
    \   but this requires intercepting and rewriting the packets carrying the\n  \
    \ SDP description; and if an interceptor can do that, many more attacks\n   are\
    \ possible, including a wholesale change of the addresses and port\n   numbers\
    \ at which the media will be sent.\n   In order to avoid attacks of this sort,\
    \ the SDP description needs to\n   be integrity protected and provided with source\
    \ authentication.  This\n   can, for example, be achieved on an end-to-end basis\
    \ using S/MIME\n   [RFC5652] [RFC5751] when SDP is used in a signaling packet\
    \ using MIME\n   types (application/sdp).  Alternatively, HTTPS [RFC2818] or the\n\
    \   authentication method in the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP)\n   [RFC2974]\
    \ could be used as well.\n"
