- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   IKEv2, as specified in [RFC5996], allows (Section 2.16)\n\
    \   authentication of the initiator using an EAP method.  Using EAP\n   significantly\
    \ increases the count of round trips required to\n   establish the IPsec SA and\
    \ also may require user interaction.  This\n   makes it inconvenient to allow\
    \ a single remote access client to\n   create multiple IPsec tunnels with multiple\
    \ IPsec gateways that\n   belong to the same domain.\n   The EAP Re-authentication\
    \ Protocol (ERP), as described in [RFC6696],\n   allows an EAP peer to authenticate\
    \ to multiple authenticators while\n   performing the full EAP method only once.\
    \  Subsequent authentications\n   require fewer round trips and no user interaction.\n\
    \   Bringing these two technologies together allows a remote access IPsec\n  \
    \ client to create multiple tunnels with different gateways that belong\n   to\
    \ a single domain as well as using the keys from other contexts of\n   using EAP,\
    \ such as network access within the same domain, to\n   transparently connect\
    \ to VPN gateways within this domain.\n   Additionally, it allows for faster set\
    \ up of new tunnels when\n   previous tunnels have been torn down due to things\
    \ like network\n   outage, device suspension, or a temporary move out of range.\
    \  This is\n   similar to the session resumption mechanism described in [RFC5723].\n\
    \   One exception being that instead of a ticket stored by the client,\n   the\
    \ re-authentication Master Session Key (rMSK) (see Section 4.6 of\n   [RFC6696])\
    \ is used as the session key stored on both the client and\n   the Authentication,\
    \ Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server.\n"

- title: 2.  Usage Scenarios
  contents:
  - "2.  Usage Scenarios\n   This work is motivated by the following scenarios:\n\
    \   o  Multiple tunnels for a single remote access VPN client.  Suppose a\n  \
    \    company has offices in New York City, Paris, and Shanghai.  For\n      historical\
    \ reasons, the email server is located in the Paris\n      office, most of the\
    \ servers hosting the company's intranet are\n      located in Shanghai, and the\
    \ finance department servers are in New\n      York City.  An employee using a\
    \ remote access VPN may need to\n      connect to servers from all three locations.\
    \  While it is possible\n      to connect to a single gateway, and have that gateway\
    \ route the\n      requests to the other gateways (perhaps through site to site\
    \ VPN),\n      this is not efficient; it is more desirable to have the client\n\
    \      initiate three different tunnels.  It is, however, not desirable\n    \
    \  to have the user type in a password three times.\n   o  Roaming.  In these\
    \ days of mobile phones and tablets, users often\n      move from the wireless\
    \ LAN in their office, where access may be\n      granted through 802.1x, to a\
    \ cellular network, where a VPN is\n      necessary, and back again.  Both the\
    \ VPN server and the 802.1x\n      access point are authenticators that connect\
    \ to the same AAA\n      servers.  So it makes sense to make the transition smooth,\
    \ without\n      requiring user interaction.  The device still needs to detect\n\
    \      whether it is within the protected network, in which case it\n      should\
    \ not use VPN.  However, this process is beyond the scope of\n      this document.\
    \  [SECBEAC] is a now-abandoned attempt at this.\n   o  Resumption.  If a device\
    \ gets disconnected from an IKE peer, ERP\n      can be used to reconnect to the\
    \ same gateway without user\n      intervention.\n"
- title: 3.  Protocol Outline
  contents:
  - "3.  Protocol Outline\n   Supporting EAP Re-authentication Extension (ERX) requires\
    \ an EAP\n   payload in the first IKE_AUTH request.  This is a deviation from\
    \ the\n   rules in [RFC5996], so support needs to be indicated through a Notify\n\
    \   payload in the IKE_SA_INIT response.  This Notify serves the same\n   purpose\
    \ as the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start message of ERX, as\n   specified in Section\
    \ 5.3.1 of [RFC6696].  The \"Domain Name\" field\n   contains the content of the\
    \ Domain-Name TLV as specified in Section\n   5.3.1.1 of the same document.\n\
    \   A supporting initiator that has unexpired keys for this domain will\n   send\
    \ the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message in an EAP payload in the first\n   IKE_AUTH\
    \ request.\n   The responder sends the EAP payload content to a backend AAA server.\n\
    \   If that server has a valid rMSK for that session, it sends those\n   along\
    \ with an EAP-Finish/Re-auth message.  The responder then\n   forwards the EAP-Finish/Re-auth\
    \ message to the initiator in an EAP\n   payload within the first IKE_AUTH response.\n\
    \   The initiator then sends an additional IKE_AUTH request that includes\n  \
    \ the AUTH payload, which has been calculated using the rMSK in the\n   role of\
    \ the MSK as described in Sections 2.15 and 2.16 of [RFC5996].\n   The responder\
    \ replies similarly, and the IKE_AUTH exchange is\n   finished.\n   If the backend\
    \ AAA server does not have valid keys for the Re-auth-\n   Start message, it sends\
    \ back a normal EAP request, and no rMSK key.\n   EAP flow continues as in [RFC5996].\n\
    \   The following figure is adapted from Appendixes C.1 and C.3 of\n   [RFC5996],\
    \ with most of the optional payloads removed.  Note that the\n   EAP-Initiate/Re-auth\
    \ message is added.\n   IKE_SA_INIT Exchange:\n   | init request         --> SA,\
    \ KE, Ni,\n   |\n   | init response       <-- SA, KE, Nr,\n   |              \

    \  --> EAP(EAP-Initiate/Re-auth),\n   |                         IDi,\n   |   \

    \ request        --> AUTH\n   |\n   | last response       <-- AUTH,\n   |    \
    \                     SA, TSi, TSr\n   The IDi payload MUST have ID Type ID_RFC822_ADDR,\
    \ and the data field\n   MUST contain the same value as the KeyName-NAI TLV in\
    \ the EAP-\n   Initiate/Re-auth message.  See Section 3.2 for details.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Clarification about EAP Codes
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Clarification about EAP Codes\n   Section 3.16 of [RFC5996] enumerates\
    \ the EAP codes in EAP messages\n   that are carried in EAP payloads.  The enumeration\
    \ goes only to 4.\n   It is not clear whether or not that list is supposed to\
    \ be\n   exhaustive.\n   To clarify, an implementation conforming to this specification\
    \ MUST\n   accept and transmit EAP messages with at least the codes for Initiate\n\
    \   and Finish (5 and 6) from Section 5.3 of [RFC6696], in addition to\n   the\
    \ four codes enumerated in [RFC5996].  This document is\n   intentionally silent\
    \ about other EAP codes that are not enumerated in\n   those documents.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Username in the Protocol
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Username in the Protocol\n   The authors, as well as participants of the\
    \ HOKEY and IPsecME working\n   groups, believe that all use cases for this extension\
    \ to IKE have a\n   single backend AAA server doing both the authentication and\
    \ the re-\n   authentication.  The reasoning behind this is that IKE runs over\
    \ the\n   Internet and would naturally connect to the user's home network.\n \
    \  This section addresses instances where this is not the case.\n   Section 5.3.2\
    \ of [RFC6696] describes the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth packet,\n   which, in the case\
    \ of IKEv2, is carried in the first IKE_AUTH\n   request.  This packet contains\
    \ the KeyName-NAI TLV.  This TLV\n   contains the username used in authentication.\
    \  It is relayed to the\n   AAA server in the AccessRequest message and is returned\
    \ from the AAA\n   server in the AccessAccept message.\n   The username part of\
    \ the Network Access Identifier (NAI) within the\n   TLV is the EMSKName [RFC5295]\
    \ encoded in hexadecimal digits.  The\n   domain part is the domain name of the\
    \ home domain of the user.  The\n   username part is ephemeral in the sense that\
    \ a new one is generated\n   for each full authentication.  This ephemeral value\
    \ is not a good\n   basis for making policy decisions, and it is also a poor source\
    \ of\n   user identification for the purposes of logging.\n   Instead, it is up\
    \ to the implementation in the IPsec gateway to make\n   policy decisions based\
    \ on other factors.  The following list is by no\n   means exhaustive:\n   o \
    \ In some cases, the home domain name may be enough to make policy\n      decisions.\
    \  If all users with a particular home domain get the\n      same authorization,\
    \ then policy does not depend on the real\n      username.  Meaningful logs can\
    \ still be issued by correlating VPN\n      gateway IKE events with AAA servers\
    \ access records.\n   o  Sometimes users receive different authorizations based\
    \ on groups\n      to which they belong.  The AAA server can communicate such\n\
    \      information to the VPN gateway, for example, using the CLASS\n      attribute\
    \ [RFC2865] in RADIUS and Diameter [RFC6733].  Logging\n      again depends on\
    \ correlation with AAA servers.\n   o  AAA servers may support extensions that\
    \ allow them to communicate\n      with their clients (in our case -- the VPN\
    \ gateway) to push user\n      information.  For example, a certain product integrates\
    \ a RADIUS\n      server with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)\n\
    \      [RFC4511], so a client could query the server using LDAP and\n      receive\
    \ the real record for this user.  Others may provide this\n      data through\
    \ vendor-specific extensions to RADIUS or Diameter.\n   In any case, authorization\
    \ is a major issue in deployments, if the\n   backend AAA server supporting the\
    \ re-authentication is different from\n   the AAA server that had supported the\
    \ original authentication.  It is\n   up to the re-authenticating AAA server to\
    \ provide the necessary\n   information for authorization.  A conforming implementation\
    \ of this\n   protocol MAY reject initiators for which it is unable to make policy\n\
    \   decisions because of these reasons.\n"

- title: 5.  Operational Considerations

  - "5.  Operational Considerations\n   This specification changes the behavior of\
    \ IKE peers, both initiators\n   and responders.  The behavior of backend AAA\
    \ servers is not changed\n   by this specification, but they are required to support\
    \ [RFC6696].\n   The same goes for the EAP client, if it's not integrated into\
    \ the IKE\n   initiator (for example, if the EAP client is an operating system\n\
    \   component).\n   This specification is silent about key storage and key lifetimes\
    \ on\n   either the EAP client or the EAP server.  These issues are covered in\n\
    \   Sections 3, 4, and 5 of [RFC6696].  The key lifetime may be\n   communicated\
    \ from the AAA server to the EAP client via the Lifetime\n   attribute in the\
    \ EAP-Finish/Re-auth message.  If the server does not\n   have a valid key, while\
    \ the client does have one, regular EAP is used\n   (see Section 3).  This should\
    \ not happen if lifetimes are\n   communicated.  In such a case, the IKEv2 initiator\
    \ / EAP client MAY\n   alert the user and MAY log the event.  Note that this does\
    \ not\n   necessarily indicate an attack.  It could simply be a loss of state\n\

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The protocol extension described in this document\
    \ extends the\n   authentication from one EAP context, which may or may not be\
    \ part of\n   IKEv2, to an IKEv2 context.  Successful completion of the protocol\n\
    \   proves to the authenticator, which in our case is a VPN gateway, that\n  \
    \ the supplicant or VPN client has authenticated in some other EAP\n   context.\n\
    \   The protocol supplies the authenticator with the domain name with\n   which\
    \ the supplicant has authenticated, but does not supply it with a\n   specific\
    \ identity.  Instead, the gateway receives an EMSKName, which\n   is an ephemeral\
    \ ID.  With this variant of the IKEv2 protocol, the\n   initiator never sends\
    \ its real identity on the wire while the server\n   does.  This is different\
    \ from the usual IKEv2 practice of the\n   initiator revealing its identity first.\n\
    \   If the domain name is sufficient to make access control decisions,\n   this\
    \ is enough.  If not, then the gateway needs to find out either\n   the real name\
    \ or authorization information for that particular user.\n   This may be done\

    \ of scope for this specification.\n"
