Abstract This document describes the usage of the 'image' media type and registers it with IANA as a top level media type for the Session Description Protocol (SDP).
This media type is primarily used by SDP to negotiate and establish T.38 media streams.
In an earlier version of the SDP specification [RFC2327] of packetized media types, such as those used with the Real time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550], share the namespace with Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) media types registry [
[RFC4289] (i.e., "MIME media types").
This is in contrast to the latest version of the SDP specification [RFC4566], which requested that an SDP specific media type registry be created and maintained by IANA.
The top level SDP media content types registered by RFC 4566
[RFC4566] are 'audio', 'video', 'text', 'application', and 'message'.
A glaring omission from this list is the 'image' media type.
The 'image' media type is an existing top level MIME media type and is widely used in SDP implementations for setting up T.38
Real Time Facsimile [T38] media streams.
This media type is extensively referenced by examples in ITU T T.38
[T38] and IETF Standards Track documents like RFC 4145
The following example shows the media description of a T.38 media stream as commonly found in a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] INVITE; it contains an SDP offer for T.38 over both UDP Transport Layer (UDPTL) and TCP.
For the sake of brevity, only the SDP body of the SIP INVITE request is displayed in this example.

The purpose of this document is to register with IANA the 'image' media type as a top level SDP media type.
This ensures seamless continuity with documentation that uses the 'image' MIME media type and the previously registered MIME media sub types like 'image/t38' [RFC3362] that are used as SDP media descriptors for T.38 [T38].
This document complies with the request of Section 8.2.1 of RFC 4566
[RFC4566] that indicates: The same rules should apply for media names as for top level media content types, and where possible the same name should be registered for SDP as for MIME.
For media other than existing top level media content types, a Standards Track RFC MUST be produced for a new top level content type to be registered, and the registration MUST provide good justification why no existing media name is appropriate.

IANA Considerations IANA has registered an 'image' token in the media sub registry of the Session Description Protocols (SDP)
This registration contains the required information elements outlined in the SDP registration procedure defined in Section 8.2.8 of RFC 4566
Telephone Number: (919) 392 3266
(2)  Name being registered (as it will appear in SDP):
image (3)  Long form name in English: image (4)
Type of name ('media', 'proto', 'fmt', 'bwtype', 'nettype', or 'addrtype'): media (5)  Purpose of the registered name: The 'image' media type for the Session Description Protocol is used to describe a media stream whose content consists of one or more separate images that require appropriate hardware to display.
The media subtype further describes the specific format of the image.
Currently, the 'image' media type for SDP is used ubiquitously by the SIP control protocol to establish T.38 media streams.
(6)  Specification for the registered name: RFC 6466 4.
The 'image' media type registered by this document in the SDP parameters registry maintained by IANA is primarily for use by the offer/answer model of the Session Description Protocol [RFC3264] for the negotiation and establishment of T.38
[T38] media streams using SIP [RFC3261].
This additional SDP media type does not introduce any security considerations beyond those detailed in Section 7 of RFC 4566
The security vulnerabilities in T.38 [T38] and its associated transport protocols (TCP [RFC0793], UDP [RFC0768], and RTP [RFC3550]) are well documented in each of their respective specifications.
The ability to exchange images other than T.38 can expose the recipient to potentially malicious executable code.
