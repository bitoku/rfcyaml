- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Router Requirements [1] specifies that routers must receive\
    \ and\n   forward directed broadcasts. It also specifies that routers MUST have\n\
    \   an option to disable this feature, and that this option MUST default\n   to\
    \ permit the receiving and forwarding of directed broadcasts.  While\n   directed\
    \ broadcasts have uses, their use on the Internet backbone\n   appears to be comprised\
    \ entirely of malicious attacks on other\n   networks.\n   Changing the required\
    \ default for routers would help ensure new\n   routers connected to the Internet\
    \ do not add to the problems already\n   present.\n   The key words \"MUST\",\
    \ \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are\
    \ to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\n"
- title: 2. Discussion
  contents:
  - "2. Discussion\n   Damaging denial of service attacks led to the writing of [2]\
    \ on\n   Ingress Filtering. Many network providers and corporate networks have\n\
    \   endorsed the use of these methods to ensure their networks are not\n   the\
    \ source of such attacks.\n   A recent trend in Smurf Attacks [3] is to target\
    \ networks which\n   permit directed broadcasts from outside their networks. By\
    \ permitting\n   directed broadcasts, these systems become \"Smurf Amplifiers.\"\
    \n   While the continued implementation of ingress filters remains the\n   best\
    \ way to limit these attacks, restricting directed broadcasts\n   should also\
    \ receive priority.\n   Network service providers and corporate network operators\
    \ are urged\n   to ensure their networks are not susceptible to directed broadcast\n\
    \   packets originating outside their networks.\n   Mobile IP [4] had provisions\
    \ for using directed broadcasts in a\n   mobile node's use of  dynamic agent discovery.\
    \ While some\n   implementations support this feature, it is unclear whether it\
    \ is\n   useful. Other methods of achieving the same result are documented in\n\
    \   [5]. It may be worthwhile to consider removing the language on using\n   directed\
    \ broadcasts as Mobile IP progresses on the standards track.\n"
- title: 3. Recommendation
  contents:
  - "3. Recommendation\n   Router Requirements [1] is updated as follows:\n   Section\
    \ 4.2.2.11 (d) is replaced with:\n      (d) { <Network-prefix>, -1 }\n      Directed\
    \ Broadcast - a broadcast directed to the specified network\n      prefix.  It\
    \ MUST NOT be used as a source address.  A router MAY\n      originate Network\
    \ Directed Broadcast packets.  A router MAY have a\n      configuration option\
    \ to allow it to receive directed broadcast\n      packets, however this option\
    \ MUST be disabled by default, and thus\n      the router MUST NOT receive Network\
    \ Directed Broadcast packets\n      unless specifically configured by the end\
    \ user.\n   Section 5.3.5.2, second paragraph replaced with:\n      A router MAY\
    \ have an option to enable receiving network-prefix-\n      directed broadcasts\
    \ on an interface and MAY have an option to\n      enable forwarding network-prefix-directed\
    \ broadcasts.  These\n      options MUST default to blocking receipt and blocking\
    \ forwarding\n      of network-prefix-directed broadcasts.\n"
