  - "1. Introduction\n   In the multi-provider Internet, it is common for a service\
    \ subscriber\n   (i.e., customer) to have more than one service provider, or to\
    \ have\n   arrangements for redundant connectivity to the global connected\n \
    \  Internet. As discussed in [3], routing strategies in these cases\n   usually\
    \ require coordination between the service subscriber and its\n   providers, which\
    \ typically leads to customization of router\n   configurations (e.g., BGP \"\
    LOCAL_PREF\") not only by the subscriber,\n   but also by its providers.  Due\
    \ to the large number of customers a\n   provider serves, customization of router\
    \ configurations at the\n   provider level may present management and scalability\
    \ problems.\n   This document presents an application of the BGP community attribute\n\
    \   in simplifying the implementation of routing strategies in the\n   multi-provider\
    \ Internet.  More specifically, the technique presented\n   uses a community-based,\
    \ rather than the common AS-based,\n   configuration of the BGP \"LOCAL_PREF\"\
    . It essentially removes the\n   need for customized configuration of the BGP\
    \ \"LOCAL_PREF\" attribute\n   at the provider level while maintaining the same\
    \ level of routing\n   functionality and flexibility.\n   It also represents a\
    \ paradigm shift in that it gives the potential\n   for the customer to control\
    \ its own routing policy with respect to\n   its service provider, as well as\
    \ providing the ability for policy\n   configuration to be done at a prefix based\
    \ granularity rather than\n   the more common AS based granularity in use today.\n"

  - "2. AS-based Configuration and its Drawbacks\n   As discussed in [3], in today's\
    \ multi-provider Internet, customized\n   configuration of the BGP \"LOCAL_PREF\"\
    \ attribute is often required to\n   implement common routing strategies such\
    \ as load-sharing or backup.\n   There are two main reasons:\n     o Lack of available\
    \ implementations and deployment of routing\n       software that supports the\
    \ \"Destination Preference Attribute\"\n       (DPA) as specified in [4].\n  \
    \     DPA allows one to specify a globally transitive preference so\n       that\
    \ return traffic favors certain path. As discussed in [3],\n       the attribute\
    \ will be very useful in influencing route selection\n       for routes with identical\
    \ \"LOCAL_PREF\" and equal AS-path length.\n     o In the multi-provider Internet,\
    \ it is common for a provider\n       to assign higher BGP \"LOCAL_PREF\" values\
    \ for routes from its\n       customers than from other service providers. This\
    \ practice\n       provides some degree of protection for its customer routes,\n\
    \       and it facilitates implementation of certain routing\n       strategies.\
    \  It, however, also complicates other routing\n       implementations such as\
    \ backup arrangement, thus, requiring\n       customized \"LOCAL_PREF\" configuration.\n\
    \   Figure 1 shows a typical case of a backup arrangement in the multi-\n   provider\
    \ Internet. In Figure 1, AS1 and AS2 are both providers, and\n   AS3 and AS4 are\
    \ customers of AS1 and AS2, respectively. AS3 has\n   entered a bilateral agreement\
    \ with AS4 to provide backup to each\n   other.  That is, AS3 would use its direct\
    \ link to AS4 to reach only\n   AS4 in the normal circumstance, and for transit\
    \ in the case of a\n   failure between AS3 and AS1.  To realize this routing agreement,\
    \ AS3\n   requests that its provider AS1 adjust its BGP \"LOCAL_PREF\"\n   configuration\
    \ so that AS1 reaches AS4 via AS2.\n                          +------+      +------+\n\
    \                          | AS1  |------| AS2  |\n                          +------+\
    \      +------+\n                             |             |\n              \
    \            +------+      +------+\n                          | AS3  |------|\
    \  AS4 |\n                          +------+      +------+\n                 \
    \    Figure 1: Typical Backup Scenario\n   Primarily due to scalability and management\
    \ concerns, most providers\n   only perform \"LOCAL_PREF\" customization based\
    \ on ASs, not on IP\n   prefixes.  If IP prefix-based \"LOCAL_PREF\" configuration\
    \ is needed, a\n   technique known as as the BGP AS-path manipulation can be used.\n\
    \   However, it is currently only available in certain vendor's products.\n  \
    \ There are several drawbacks with the the practice of AS-based BGP\n   \"LOCAL_PREF\"\
    \ configuration at the provider level:\n      o The implementation tends to less\
    \ efficient due to the process\n        of coordination and configuration.  More\
    \ importantly, the\n        process needs to be repeated each time a change (e.g.,\
    \ adding\n        a new AS) occurs.\n      o The AS-based customization complicates\
    \ router configuration\n        and increases complexity of network operation.\
    \ It has become\n        a serious scalability issue for providers.\n      o It\
    \ can not implement prefix-based configuration without the\n        AS-path manipulation\
    \ (i.e., using fake AS).\n      o Keeping configuration up-to-date is some times\
    \ problematic.\n"

- title: 3.1 Overview of the Community Attribute
  contents:
  - "3.1 Overview of the Community Attribute\n   The BGP community path attribute\
    \ is an optional transitive attribute\n   of variable length [1,2]. The attribute\
    \ consists of a set of four\n   octet values, each of which specify a community.\
    \  The community\n   attribute values are encoded using an AS number in the first\
    \ two\n   octets, with the remaining two octets defined by the AS. As defined\n\
    \   in [2], a community is a group of destinations (i.e. prefixes) that\n   share\
    \ some common attribute.  Each destination can belong to multiple\n   communities.\
    \  All prefixes with the community attribute belong to the\n   communities listed\
    \ in the attribute.\n   The BGP community  allows one to group a set of prefixes\
    \ and perform\n   routing decisions based on the identity of the group.\n   The\
    \ well-known communities NO_EXPORT (0xFFFFFF01) and NO_ADVERTISE\n   (0xFFFFFF02)\
    \ are intuitive,  and can be used for optimizing routing\n   and for improving\
    \ route aggregation.\n"
- title: 3.2 Community-based Configuration
  contents:
  - "3.2 Community-based Configuration\n   With the BGP community attribute [2], a\
    \ provider can now use\n   community-based, rather than AS-based, configuration\
    \ of BGP\n   \"LOCAL_PREF\".  The provider first needs to coordinate with its\n\
    \   customers a set of communities to be mapped to certain BGP\n   \"LOCAL_PREF\"\
    \ values.  The provider can then apply a uniform BGP\n   configuration to all\
    \ its customers that would capture routes with the\n   community values, and set\
    \ up the appropriate BGP \"LOCAL_PREF\" values\n   accordingly.  A customer that\
    \ requires customization in its provider\n   BGP \"LOCAL_PREF\" configuration\
    \ can simply send the appropriate\n   community values in its routing announcements.\n\
    \   The major advantages of using this technique include:\n      o The customer\
    \ has full control in the process, which makes a\n        lot of sense as the\
    \ customer is in a position to have better\n        understanding about its own\
    \ topology and routing policy\n        requirement.\n      o The effect of route-based\
    \ customization in BGP \"LOCAL_PREF\"\n        configuration by providers can\
    \ now be achieved, thus, removing\n        the need of AS-Path manipulation in\
    \ certain cases.\n      o It addresses the scalability issue facing providers\
    \ as it\n        distributes the configuration work to the customer that\n   \
    \     requires customization.\n"

  - "4. A Real-World Implementation Example\n   MCI currently makes heavy use of the\
    \ BGP \"LOCAL_PREF\" attribute value\n   as part of its routing policy configuration\
    \ process.  Different BGP\n   \"LOCAL_PREF\" values are assigned for routes from\
    \ different sources.\n   Table 1 details these values:\n                  +-------------------------+------------+\n\

    \                    Table 1: Defined LOCAL_PREF Values\n   Note:\n       o The\
    \ value '100' is the default value used within our network\n         configuration.\n\
    \       o In most cases, the MED attribute set by a customer is\n         sufficient\
    \ for customer backup routes (e.g., T1 backs up T3).\n         However, in certain\
    \ cases configuration of \"LOCAL_PREF\" will\n         still be necessary until\
    \ the BGP DPA attribute is available.\n   To make use of the BGP community attribute,\
    \ several community values\n   (MCI's AS number: 3561 = 0x0DE9) have been defined\
    \ that can be used\n   by customers to tag routes so that the appropriate \"LOCAL_PREF\"\
    \n   values are configured. Table 2 lists the appropriate community\n   attribute\
    \ values (and the mappings of community to LOCAL_PREF):\n                    +---------------------+------------+\n\

    \ LOCAL_PREF Mapping\n   A customer requiring MCI to configure BGP \"LOCAL_PREF\"\
    \ values other\n   than the default can tag their routes with the defined communities.\n\
    \   The community values can be configured either based on an AS path\n   list\
    \ or an IP address access list. A cisco systems software specific\n   configuration\
    \ example is given in Appendix A to show how this can be\n   achieved.\n   A uniform\

    \ \"LOCAL_PREF\" values based on the\n   communities received.\n   This technique\
    \ has been tested and is in use with several customers,\n   and the response has\
