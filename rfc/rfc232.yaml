    \ meeting held in July at\nM.I.T., we tentatively scheduled the next Network Graphics\n\
    meeting which is being hosted by Stanford AI, for October\n17, 18, and 19.  Because\
    \ the Network Working Group meeting\nis being held on October 10, 11, 12, 13,\
    \ and 14 it has been\ndecided to postpone the Network Graphics meeting.  As soon\n\
    as a new date for the meeting is established it will be\nannounced via an RFC.\
    \  It is expected that the meeting will\nbe held in the San Francisco area sometime\
    \ in November or\nearly December.\n[ This RFC was put into machine readable form\
    \ for entry ]\n[ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n[ direction\
    \ of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96   ]\n"
