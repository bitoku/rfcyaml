  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies a new skippable extension that can
    be added\n   by the Foreign Agent and Home Agent in any registration message\n
    \  targeted for the Mobile Node.  Such a message may be either a\n   Registration
    Reply or Registration Revocation (i.e., co-located\n   Care-of Address mode).
    \ For the Registration Reply message, this\n   extension can be added regardless
    of whether the registration has\n   succeeded or failed.\n   The content of the
    text string in this extension and its usage by the\n   Mobile Node is implementation
    specific.  The text string in this\n   extension is intended for the user of the
    Mobile Node.  For example,\n   this message can be displayed on the Mobile Node's
    user interface,\n   logged, or handled in any other implementation dependent way,\n
    \  depending on the form of the Mobile Node.\n   Typical contents of the text
    string will indicate a registration\n   failure reason, or give a welcome message
    on successful registration.\n   This is important, as the failure reason code
    gives very limited\n   information for interpretation by the user of the Mobile
    Node.  For\n   example, a string like \"registration failed : Prepaid Quota for
    the\n   user is exhausted\" can give a human readable description of the\n   result
    of Mobile IP registration.\n"

    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"

  - "3.  Mobile IPv4 Message String Extension Format\n   The Message String Extension
    conforms to the Short Extension format\n   specified for Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344].
    \ The Message String Extension is\n   a skippable extension.\n    0                   1

    \  Type:\n      145: An 8-bit identifier of the type mobility option.\n   Length:\n
    \     An 8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the extension, in bytes,\n      excluding
    the extension Type and the extension Length fields.\n      This field MUST be
    set to 1 plus the total length of the Text\n      field.\n   Sub-Type:\n      1:
    Extension comes from the Home Agent\n      2: Extension comes from the Foreign
    Agent\n   Text:\n      The Text field is one or more octets, and its contents
    are\n      implementation dependent.  It is intended to be human readable,\n      and
    MUST NOT affect the operation of the protocol.  The message\n      MUST be in
    UTF-8 encoded ISO-10646 [RFC3629] characters.  The\n      number of octets in
    the encoded representation of the message is\n      always exactly the value of
    the Length field minus one.  (The\n      number of unicode characters represented
    by this octet sequence\n      may be smaller than the number of octets.)\n"
  title: 3.  Mobile IPv4 Message String Extension Format
- contents:
  - "4.  Operation and Use of the Message String Extension\n   The Message String
    Extension is only valid for use within Mobile IPv4\n   Registration Reply and
    Registration Revocation messages.  The Message\n   String Extension is a skippable
    extension.  Either the Home Agent or\n   Foreign Agent or both can add the Message
    String Extension to\n   registration messages.  The usage of Text field of the
    Message String\n   Extension is implementation dependent.  For example, the message
    can\n   be displayed on the Mobile Node's user interface, logged, or handled\n
    \  in an implementation dependent way, depending on the form of the\n   Mobile
    Node.  The Mobile Node may throttle how often the user is\n   notified of the
    message.\n   As an example, the Home Agent may reject the first Registration\n
    \  Request because the prepaid quota for the user is reached and may\n   attach
    a Message String Extension with the text \"Prepaid quota\n   reached.  Please
    contact www.paymore.example.com to update balance\".\n   The Mobile Node could
    display this on the user interface.  As a\n   response, the user of the Mobile
    Node may take the required action to\n   update the prepaid account and retry
    the registration process.  The\n   Home Agent may accept this Registration Request
    and attach a Message\n   String Extension with the text \"Welcome to\n   www.serviceprovider.example.com\".
    \ The Mobile Node could display this\n   on the user interface, thus confirming
    a successful creation of\n   binding on Home Agent.\n   In the case that the message
    is not originated by the Home Agent\n   itself, but for instance, is received
    from a RADIUS server [RFC2865],\n   it could be received in some other encoding
    than UTF-8.  If so, the\n   Home Agent MUST convert the message to UTF-8 encoded
    ISO-10646\n   [RFC3629] characters.\n"
  title: 4.  Operation and Use of the Message String Extension
- contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The Message String Extension can be added by
    the Home Agent or\n   Foreign Agent or both.  The protection of the extension
    is based on\n   the ordering method specified for message authentication in RFC
    3344\n   [RFC3344] and emphasized below.\n   If the extension is added by the
    Home Agent (extension with subtype\n   1) to a Registration Reply or Registration
    Revocation message, it\n   MUST appear before Mobile-Home Authentication Extension
    [RFC3344].\n   If the extension is added by the Foreign Agent (extension with\n
    \  subtype 2) to a Registration Reply message, it MUST appear after\n   Mobile-Home
    Authentication Extension [RFC3344] whenever present.\n   Also the extension MUST
    appear before the Mobile-Foreign\n   Authentication Extension whenever present.
    \ However, since security\n   association between the Mobile Node and Foreign
    Agent is optional, it\n   is possible that the extension is not authenticated
    in this case.\n   There is no confidentiality provided by the extension; the message
    is\n   transferred unencrypted, and if sensitive information is sent for\n   display
    purposes, it may need to be protected by other means.\n"
  title: 5.  Security Considerations
- contents:
  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   This specification reserves number 145 for the Message
    String\n   Extension in Section 3 from the space of numbers for skippable\n   mobility
    extensions (i.e., 128-255) defined for Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344]\n   at http://www.iana.org/assignments/mobileip-numbers.\n
    \  This specification also creates a new subtype space for the type\n   number
    of this extension.  The subtype values 1 and 2 are defined in\n   this specification.
    \ The subtype value 1 is reserved for use by the\n   Home Agent and subtype value
    2 is reserved for use by the Foreign\n   Agent.  Similar to the procedures specified
    for Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344]\n   number spaces, future allocations from this number
    space require\n   expert review [RFC2434].\n"

    and Henrik\n   Levkowetz for their useful comments on an earlier version of this\n
    \  document.  Also, Russ Housley, Vidya Narayanan, Blake Ramsdell, Paul\n   Hoffman,
    and Jeff Hutzelman provided justifications to mandate the\n   need for only UTF-8
    encoding in the message and solicited better\n   clarifications in the security
    considerations section.\n"
