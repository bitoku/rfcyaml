  - "1.  Introduction\n   The purpose of the WSON information model described in this\
    \ document\n   is to facilitate constrained optical path computation, and as such\
    \ it\n   is not a general-purpose network management information model.  This\n\
    \   constraint is frequently referred to as the \"wavelength continuity\"\n  \
    \ constraint, and the corresponding constrained optical path\n   computation is\
    \ known as the Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA)\n   problem.  Hence, the\
    \ information model must provide sufficient\n   topology and wavelength restriction\
    \ and availability information to\n   support this computation.  More details\
    \ on the RWA process and WSON\n   subsystems and their properties can be found\
    \ in [RFC6163].  The model\n   defined here includes constraints between WSON\
    \ signal attributes and\n   network elements but does not include optical impairments.\n\
    \   In addition to presenting an information model suitable for path\n   computation\
    \ in WSON, this document also highlights model aspects that\n   may have general\
    \ applicability to other technologies utilizing a\n   GMPLS control plane.  The\
    \ portion of the information model applicable\n   to technologies beyond WSON\
    \ is referred to as \"general\" to\n   distinguish it from the \"WSON-specific\"\
    \ portion that is applicable\n   only to WSON technology.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   Refer to [RFC6163] for definitions of Reconfigurable Optical\
    \ Add/Drop\n   Multiplexer (ROADM), RWA, Wavelength Conversion, Wavelength Division\n\
    \   Multiplexing (WDM), WSON, and other related terminology used in this\n   document.\n"
- title: 3.  Routing and Wavelength Assignment Information Model
  contents:
  - "3.  Routing and Wavelength Assignment Information Model\n   The WSON RWA information\
    \ model in this document comprises four\n   categories of information.  The categories\
    \ are independent of whether\n   the information comes from a switching subsystem\
    \ or from a line\n   subsystem -- a switching subsystem refers to WSON nodes such\
    \ as a\n   ROADM or an Optical Add/Drop Multiplexer (OADM), and a line subsystem\n\
    \   refers to devices such as WDM or Optical Amplifier.  The categories\n   are\
    \ these:\n   o  Node Information\n   o  Link Information\n   o  Dynamic Node Information\n\
    \   o  Dynamic Link Information\n   Note that this is roughly the categorization\
    \ used in Section 7 of\n   [G.7715].\n   In the following, where applicable, the\
    \ Reduced Backus-Naur Form\n   (RBNF) syntax of [RBNF] is used to aid in defining\
    \ the RWA\n   information model.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Dynamic and Relatively Static Information
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Dynamic and Relatively Static Information\n   All the RWA information of\
    \ concern in a WSON network is subject to\n   change over time.  Equipment can\
    \ be upgraded; links may be placed in\n   or out of service and the like.  However,\
    \ from the point of view of\n   RWA computations, there is a difference between\
    \ information that can\n   change with each successive connection establishment\
    \ in the network\n   and information that is relatively static and independent\
    \ of\n   connection establishment.  A key example of the former is link\n   wavelength\
    \ usage since this can change with connection setup/teardown\n   and this information\
    \ is a key input to the RWA process.  Examples of\n   relatively static information\
    \ are the potential port connectivity of\n   a WDM ROADM, and the channel spacing\
    \ on a WDM link.\n   This document separates, where possible, dynamic and static\n\
    \   information so that these can be kept separate in possible encodings.\n  \
    \ This allows for separate updates of these two types of information,\n   thereby\
    \ reducing processing and traffic load caused by the timely\n   distribution of\
    \ the more dynamic RWA WSON information.\n"
- title: 4.  Node Information (General)
  contents:
  - "4.  Node Information (General)\n   The node information described here contains\
    \ the relatively static\n   information related to a WSON node.  This includes\
    \ connectivity\n   constraints amongst ports and wavelengths since WSON switches\
    \ can\n   exhibit asymmetric switching properties.  Additional information\n \
    \  could include properties of wavelength converters in the node, if any\n   are\
    \ present.  In [Switch] it was shown that the wavelength\n   connectivity constraints\
    \ for a large class of practical WSON devices\n   can be modeled via switched\
    \ and fixed connectivity matrices along\n   with corresponding switched and fixed\
    \ port constraints.  These\n   connectivity matrices are included with the node\
    \ information, while\n   the switched and fixed port wavelength constraints are\
    \ included with\n   the link information.\n   Formally,\n   <Node_Information>\
    \ ::= <Node_ID> [<ConnectivityMatrix>...]\n   Where the Node_ID would be an appropriate\
    \ identifier for the node\n   within the WSON RWA context.\n   Note that multiple\
    \ connectivity matrices are allowed and hence can\n   fully support the most-general\
    \ cases enumerated in [Switch].\n"
- title: 4.1.  Connectivity Matrix
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Connectivity Matrix\n   The connectivity matrix (ConnectivityMatrix) represents\
    \ either the\n   potential connectivity matrix for asymmetric switches (e.g.,\
    \ ROADMs\n   and such) or fixed connectivity for an asymmetric device such as\
    \ a\n   multiplexer.  Note that this matrix does not represent any particular\n\
    \   internal blocking behavior but indicates which input ports and\n   wavelengths\
    \ could possibly be connected to a particular output port.\n   For a switch or\
    \ ROADM, representing blocking that is dependent on the\n   internal state is\
    \ beyond the scope of this document.  Due to its\n   highly implementation-dependent\
    \ nature, it would most likely not be\n   subject to standardization in the future.\
    \  The connectivity matrix is\n   a conceptual M by N matrix representing the\
    \ potential switched or\n   fixed connectivity, where M represents the number\
    \ of input ports and\n   N the number of output ports.  This is a \"conceptual\"\
    \ matrix since\n   the matrix tends to exhibit structure that allows for very\
    \ compact\n   representations that are useful for both transmission and path\n\
    \   computation.\n   Note that the connectivity matrix information element can\
    \ be useful\n   in any technology context where asymmetric switches are utilized.\n\
    \   <ConnectivityMatrix> ::= <MatrixID>\n                            <ConnType>\n\
    \                            <Matrix>\n   Where\n   <MatrixID> is a unique identifier\
    \ for the matrix.\n   <ConnType> can be either 0 or 1 depending upon whether the\n\
    \   connectivity is either fixed or switched.\n   <Matrix> represents the fixed\
    \ or switched connectivity in that\n   Matrix(i, j) = 0 or 1 depending on whether\
    \ input port i can connect\n   to output port j for one or more wavelengths.\n"
- title: 5.  Node Information (WSON Specific)
  contents:
  - "5.  Node Information (WSON Specific)\n   As discussed in [RFC6163], a WSON node\
    \ may contain electro-optical\n   subsystems such as regenerators, wavelength\
    \ converters or entire\n   switching subsystems.  The model present here can be\
    \ used in\n   characterizing the accessibility and availability of limited\n \
    \  resources such as regenerators or wavelength converters as well as\n   WSON\
    \ signal attribute constraints of electro-optical subsystems.  As\n   such, this\
    \ information element is fairly specific to WSON\n   technologies.\n   In this\
    \ document, the term \"resource\" is used to refer to a physical\n   component\
    \ of a WSON node such as a regenerator or a wavelength\n   converter.  Multiple\
    \ instances of such components are often present\n   within a single WSON node.\
    \  This term is not to be confused with the\n   concept of forwarding or switching\
    \ resources such as bandwidth or\n   lambdas.\n   A WSON node may include regenerators\
    \ or wavelength converters\n   arranged in a shared pool.  As discussed in [RFC6163],\
    \ a WSON node\n   can also include WDM switches that use optical-electronic-optical\n\
    \   (OEO) processing.  There are a number of different approaches used in\n  \
    \ the design of WDM switches containing regenerator or converter pools.\n   However,\
    \ from the point of view of path computation, the following\n   need to be known:\n\
    \   1.  The nodes that support regeneration or wavelength conversion.\n   2. \
    \ The accessibility and availability of a wavelength converter to\n       convert\
    \ from a given input wavelength on a particular input port\n       to a desired\
    \ output wavelength on a particular output port.\n   3.  Limitations on the types\
    \ of signals that can be converted and the\n       conversions that can be performed.\n\
    \   Since resources tend to be packaged together in blocks of similar\n   devices,\
    \ e.g., on line cards or other types of modules, the\n   fundamental unit of identifiable\
    \ resource in this document is the\n   \"resource block\".\n   A resource block\
    \ is a collection of resources from the same WSON node\n   that are grouped together\
    \ for administrative reasons and for ease of\n   encoding in the protocols.  All\
    \ resources in the same resource block\n   behave in the same way and have similar\
    \ characteristics relevant to\n   the optical system, e.g., processing properties,\
    \ accessibility, etc.\n   A resource pool is a collection of resource blocks for\
    \ the purpose of\n   representing throughput or cross-connect capabilities in\
    \ a WSON node.\n   A resource pool associates input ports or links on the node\
    \ with\n   output ports or links and is used to indicate how signals may be\n\
    \   passed from an input port or link to an output port or link by way of\n  \
    \ a resource block (in other words, by way of a resource).  A resource\n   pool\
    \ may, therefore, be modeled as a matrix.\n   A resource block may be present\
    \ in multiple resource pools.\n   This leads to the following formal high-level\
    \ model:\n   <Node_Information> ::= <Node_ID>\n                          [<ConnectivityMatrix>...]\n\
    \                          [<ResourcePool>]\n   Where\n   <ResourcePool> ::= <ResourceBlockInfo>...\n\
    \                     [<ResourceAccessibility>...]\n                     [<ResourceWaveConstraints>...]\n\
    \                     [<RBPoolState>]\n   First, the accessibility of resource\
    \ blocks is addressed; then, their\n   properties are discussed.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Resource Accessibility/Availability
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Resource Accessibility/Availability\n   A similar technique as used to\
    \ model ROADMs, and optical switches can\n   be used to model regenerator/converter\
    \ accessibility.  This technique\n   was generally discussed in [RFC6163] and\
    \ consisted of a matrix to\n   indicate possible connectivity along with wavelength\
    \ constraints for\n   links/ports.  Since regenerators or wavelength converters\
    \ may be\n   considered a scarce resource, it is desirable that the model include,\n\
    \   if desired, the usage state (availability) of individual regenerators\n  \
    \ or converters in the pool.  Models that incorporate more state to\n   further\
    \ reveal blocking conditions on input or output to particular\n   converters are\
    \ for further study and not included here.\n   The three-stage model is shown\
    \ schematically in Figures 1 and 2.  The\n   difference between the two figures\
    \ is that in Figure 1 it's assumed\n   that each signal that can get to a resource\
    \ block may do so, while in\n   Figure 2 the access to sets of resource blocks\
    \ is via a shared fiber\n   that imposes its own wavelength collision constraint.\
    \  Figure 1 shows\n   that there can be more than one input to each resource block\
    \ since\n   each input represents a single wavelength signal, while Figure 2\n\
    \   shows a single WDM input or output, e.g., a fiber, to/from each set\n   of\
    \ blocks.\n   This model assumes N input ports (fibers), P resource blocks\n \
    \  containing one or more identical resources (e.g., wavelength\n   converters),\
    \ and M output ports (fibers).  Since not all input ports\n   can necessarily\
    \ reach each resource block, the model starts with a\n   resource pool input matrix\
    \ RI(i,p) = {0,1} depending on whether input\n   port i can potentially reach\
    \ resource block p.\n   Since not all wavelengths can necessarily reach all the\
    \ resources or\n   the resources may have limited input wavelength range, the\
    \ model has\n   a set of relatively static input port constraints for each resource.\n\
    \   In addition, if the access to a set of resource blocks is via a\n   shared\
    \ fiber (Figure 2), this would impose a dynamic wavelength\n   availability constraint\
    \ on that shared fiber.  The resource block\n   input port constraint is modeled\
    \ via a static wavelength set\n   mechanism, and the case of shared access to\
    \ a set of blocks is\n   modeled via a dynamic wavelength set mechanism.\n   Next,\
    \ a state vector RA(j) = {0,...,k} is used to track the number of\n   resources\
    \ in resource block j in use.  This is the only state kept in\n   the resource\
    \ pool model.  This state is not necessary for modeling\n   \"fixed\" transponder\
    \ system or full OEO switches with WDM interfaces,\n   i.e., systems where there\
    \ is no sharing.\n   After that, a set of static resource output wavelength constraints\n\
    \   and possibly dynamic shared output fiber constraints maybe used.  The\n  \
    \ static constraints indicate what wavelengths a particular resource\n   block\
    \ can generate or is restricted to generating, e.g., a fixed\n   regenerator would\
    \ be limited to a single lambda.  The dynamic\n   constraints would be used in\
    \ the case where a single shared fiber is\n   used to output the resource block\
    \ (Figure 2).\n   Finally, to complete the model, a resource pool output matrix\
    \ RE(p,k)\n   = {0,1} depending on whether the output from resource block p can\n\
    \   reach output port k, may be used.\n      I1   +-------------+            \

    \      CHANNEL_COUNT: The number of channels is restricted to be less\n      \
    \   than or equal to the MaxNumChannels parameter (which is\n         required).\n\
    \      LABEL_RANGE:  Used to indicate a restriction on a range of labels\n   \
    \      that can be switched.  For example, a waveband device with a\n        \
    \ tunable center frequency and passband.  This constraint is\n         characterized\
    \ by the MaxLabelRange parameter, which indicates\n         the maximum range\
    \ of the labels, e.g., which may represent a\n         waveband in terms of channels.\
    \  Note that an additional\n         parameter can be used to indicate the overall\
    \ tuning range.\n         Specific center frequency tuning information can be\
    \ obtained\n         from information about the dynamic channel in use.  It is\n\
    \         assumed that both center frequency and bandwidth (Q) tuning can\n  \
    \       be done without causing faults in existing signals.\n      SIMPLE LABEL\
    \ and CHANNEL COUNT: In this case, the accompanying\n         label set and MaxNumChannels\
    \ indicate labels permitted on the\n         port and the maximum number of labels\
    \ that can be\n         simultaneously used on the port.\n      LINK LABEL_EXCLUSIVITY:\
    \ A label (wavelength) can be used at most\n         once among a given set of\

    \ LabelSet is a conceptual set of labels (wavelengths).\n      MaxNumChannels\
    \ is the maximum number of channels that can be\n         simultaneously used\
    \ (relative to either a port or a matrix).\n      LinkSet is a conceptual set\
    \ of ports.\n   MaxLabelRange indicates the maximum range of the labels.  For\n\
    \   example, if the port is a \"colored\" drop port of a ROADM, then there\n \

    \ corresponding to the frequency of the permitted wavelength.\n   See [Switch]\
    \ for a complete waveband example.\n   This information model for port wavelength\
    \ (label) restrictions is\n   fairly general in that it can be applied to ports\
    \ that have label\n   restrictions only or to ports that are part of an asymmetric\

  - "7.1.  Dynamic Link Information (General)\n   For WSON links, the wavelength availability\
    \ and which wavelengths are\n   in use for shared backup purposes can be considered\
    \ dynamic\n   information and hence are grouped with the dynamic information in\
    \ the\n   following set:\n   <DynamicLinkInfo> ::=  <LinkID>\n               \
    \           <AvailableLabels>\n                          [<SharedBackupLabels>]\n\
    \   AvailableLabels is a set of labels (wavelengths) currently available\n   on\
    \ the link.  Given this information and the port wavelength\n   restrictions,\
    \ one can also determine which wavelengths are currently\n   in use.  This parameter\
    \ could potentially be used with other\n   technologies that GMPLS currently covers\
    \ or may cover in the future.\n   SharedBackupLabels is a set of labels (wavelengths)\
    \ currently used\n   for shared backup protection on the link.  An example usage\
    \ of this\n   information in a WSON setting is given in [Shared].  This parameter\n\
    \   could potentially be used with other technologies that GMPLS\n   currently\
    \ covers or may cover in the future.\n   Note that the above does not dictate\
    \ a particular encoding or\n   placement for available label information.  In\
    \ some routing\n   protocols, it may be advantageous or required to place this\n\
    \   information within another information element such as the Interface\n   Switching\
    \ Capability Descriptor (ISCD).  Consult the extensions that\n   are specific\
    \ to each routing protocol for details of placement of\n   information elements.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.2.  Dynamic Node Information (WSON Specific)\n   Currently the only node information\
    \ that can be considered dynamic is\n   the resource pool state, and it can be\
    \ isolated into a dynamic node\n   information element as follows:\n   <DynamicNodeInfo>\
    \ ::=  <NodeID> [<ResourcePool>]\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   This document discusses an information model\
    \ for RWA computation in\n   WSONs.  From a security standpoint, such a model\
    \ is very similar to\n   the information that can be currently conveyed via GMPLS\
    \ routing\n   protocols.  Such information includes network topology, link state\n\
    \   and current utilization, as well as the capabilities of switches and\n   routers\
    \ within the network.  As such, this information should be\n   protected from\
    \ disclosure to unintended recipients.  In addition, the\n   intentional modification\
    \ of this information can significantly affect\n   network operations, particularly\
    \ due to the large capacity of the\n   optical infrastructure to be controlled.\
    \  A general discussion on\n   security in GMPLS networks can be found in [RFC5920].\n"
