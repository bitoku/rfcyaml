- title: 2.1.  About the MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED) Attribute
  contents:
  - "2.1.  About the MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED) Attribute\n   The BGP MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED)\
    \ attribute, formerly known as the\n   INTER_AS_METRIC, is currently defined in\
    \ section 5.1.4 of [BGP4], as\n   follows:\n      The MULTI_EXIT_DISC is an optional\
    \ non-transitive attribute that\n      is intended to be used on external (inter-AS)\
    \ links to\n      discriminate among multiple exit or entry points to the same\n\
    \      neighboring AS.  The value of the MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute is a\n    \
    \  four-octet unsigned number, called a metric.  All other factors\n      being\
    \ equal, the exit point with the lower metric SHOULD be\n      preferred.  If\
    \ received over External BGP (EBGP), the\n      MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute MAY\
    \ be propagated over Internal BGP\n      (IBGP) to other BGP speakers within the\
    \ same AS (see also\n      9.1.2.2).  The MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute received from\
    \ a\n      neighboring AS MUST NOT be propagated to other neighboring ASes.\n\
    \      A BGP speaker MUST implement a mechanism (based on local\n      configuration)\
    \ that allows the MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute to be\n      removed from a route.\
    \  If a BGP speaker is configured to remove\n      the MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute\
    \ from a route, then this removal MUST\n      be done prior to determining the\
    \ degree of preference of the route\n      and prior to performing route selection\
    \ (Decision Process phases 1\n      and 2).\n      An implementation MAY also\
    \ (based on local configuration) alter\n      the value of the MULTI_EXIT_DISC\
    \ attribute received over EBGP.  If\n      a BGP speaker is configured to alter\
    \ the value of the\n      MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute received over EBGP, then altering\
    \ the\n      value MUST be done prior to determining the degree of preference\n\
    \      of the route and prior to performing route selection (Decision\n      Process\
    \ phases 1 and 2).  See Section 9.1.2.2 for necessary\n      restrictions on this.\n\
    \   Section 9.1.2.2 (c) of [BGP4] defines the following route selection\n   criteria\
    \ regarding MEDs:\n      c) Remove from consideration routes with less-preferred\n\
    \         MULTI_EXIT_DISC attributes.  MULTI_EXIT_DISC is only comparable\n  \
    \       between routes learned from the same neighboring AS (the\n         neighboring\
    \ AS is determined from the AS_PATH attribute).\n         Routes that do not have\
    \ the MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute are\n         considered to have the lowest possible\
    \ MULTI_EXIT_DISC value.\n         This is also described in the following procedure:\n\
    \       for m = all routes still under consideration\n           for n = all routes\
    \ still under consideration\n               if (neighborAS(m) == neighborAS(n))\
    \ and (MED(n) < MED(m))\n                   remove route m from consideration\n\
    \         In the pseudo-code above, MED(n) is a function that returns the\n  \
    \       value of route n's MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute.  If route n has\n      \
    \   no MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute, the function returns the lowest\n         possible\
    \ MULTI_EXIT_DISC value (i.e., 0).\n         Similarly, neighborAS(n) is a function\
    \ that returns the\n         neighbor AS from which the route was received.  If\
    \ the route is\n         learned via IBGP, and the other IBGP speaker didn't originate\n\
    \         the route, it is the neighbor AS from which the other IBGP\n       \
    \  speaker learned the route.  If the route is learned via IBGP,\n         and\
    \ the other IBGP speaker either (a) originated the route, or\n         (b) created\
    \ the route by aggregation and the AS_PATH attribute\n         of the aggregate\
    \ route is either empty or begins with an\n         AS_SET, it is the local AS.\n\
    \         If a MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute is removed before re-advertising\n  \
    \       a route into IBGP, then comparison based on the received EBGP\n      \
    \   MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute MAY still be performed.  If an\n         implementation\
    \ chooses to remove MULTI_EXIT_DISC, then the\n         optional comparison on\
    \ MULTI_EXIT_DISC, if performed, MUST be\n         performed only among EBGP-learned\
    \ routes.  The best EBGP-\n         learned route may then be compared with IBGP-learned\
    \ routes\n         after the removal of the MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute.  If\n \
    \        MULTI_EXIT_DISC is removed from a subset of EBGP-learned\n         routes,\
    \ and the selected \"best\" EBGP-learned route will not\n         have MULTI_EXIT_DISC\
    \ removed, then the MULTI_EXIT_DISC must be\n         used in the comparison with\
    \ IBGP-learned routes.  For IBGP-\n         learned routes, the MULTI_EXIT_DISC\
    \ MUST be used in route\n         comparisons that reach this step in the Decision\
    \ Process.\n         Including the MULTI_EXIT_DISC of an EBGP-learned route in\
    \ the\n         comparison with an IBGP-learned route, then removing the\n   \
    \      MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute, and advertising the route has been\n       \
    \  proven to cause route loops.\n"
- title: 2.2.  MEDs and Potatoes
  contents:
  - "2.2.  MEDs and Potatoes\n   Let's consider a situation where traffic flows between\
    \ a pair of\n   hosts, each connected to a different transit network, which is\
    \ in\n   itself interconnected at two or more locations.  Each transit network\n\
    \   has the choice of either sending traffic to the closest peering to\n   the\
    \ adjacent transit network or passing traffic to the\n   interconnection location\
    \ that advertises the least-cost path to the\n   destination host.\n   The former\
    \ method is called \"hot potato routing\" (or closest-exit)\n   because like a\
    \ hot potato held in bare hands, whoever has it tries to\n   get rid of it quickly.\
    \  Hot potato routing is accomplished by not\n   passing the EBGP-learned MED\
    \ into IBGP.  This minimizes transit\n   traffic for the provider routing the\
    \ traffic.  Far less common is\n   \"cold potato routing\" (or best-exit) where\
    \ the transit provider uses\n   its own transit capacity to get the traffic to\
    \ the point that\n   adjacent transit provider advertised as being closest to\
    \ the\n   destination.  Cold potato routing is accomplished by passing the\n \
    \  EBGP-learned MED into IBGP.\n   If one transit provider uses hot potato routing\
    \ and another uses cold\n   potato, traffic between the two tends to be more symmetric.\
    \  However,\n   if both providers employ cold potato routing or hot potato routing\n\
    \   between their networks, it's likely that a larger amount of asymmetry\n  \
    \ would exist.\n   Depending on the business relationships, if one provider has\
    \ more\n   capacity or a significantly less congested backbone network, then\n\
    \   that provider may use cold potato routing.  An example of widespread\n   use\
    \ of cold potato routing was the NSF-funded NSFNET backbone and\n   NSF-funded\
    \ regional networks in the mid-1990s.\n   In some cases, a provider may use hot\
    \ potato routing for some\n   destinations for a given peer AS and cold potato\
    \ routing for others.\n   An example of this is the different treatment of commercial\
    \ and\n   research traffic in the NSFNET in the mid-1990s.  Today, many\n   commercial\
    \ networks exchange MEDs with customers but not with\n   bilateral peers.  However,\
    \ commercial use of MEDs varies widely, from\n   ubiquitous use to none at all.\n\
    \   In addition, many deployments of MEDs today are likely behaving\n   differently\
    \ (e.g., resulting in sub-optimal routing) than the network\n   operator intended,\
    \ which results not in hot or cold potatoes, but\n   mashed potatoes!  More information\
    \ on unintended behavior resulting\n   from MEDs is provided throughout this document.\n"
- title: 3.  Implementation and Protocol Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Implementation and Protocol Considerations\n   There are a number of implementation\
    \ and protocol peculiarities\n   relating to MEDs that have been discovered that\
    \ may affect network\n   behavior.  The following sections provide information\
    \ on these\n   issues.\n"
- title: 3.1.  MULTI_EXIT_DISC Is an Optional Non-Transitive Attribute
  contents:
  - "3.1.  MULTI_EXIT_DISC Is an Optional Non-Transitive Attribute\n   MULTI_EXIT_DISC\
    \ is a non-transitive optional attribute whose\n   advertisement to both IBGP\
    \ and EBGP peers is discretionary.  As a\n   result, some implementations enable\
    \ sending of MEDs to IBGP peers by\n   default, while others do not.  This behavior\
    \ may result in sub-\n   optimal route selection within an AS.  In addition, some\n\
    \   implementations send MEDs to EBGP peers by default, while others do\n   not.\
    \  This behavior may result in sub-optimal inter-domain route\n   selection.\n"
- title: 3.2.  MED Values and Preferences
  contents:
  - "3.2.  MED Values and Preferences\n   Some implementations consider an MED value\
    \ of zero less preferable\n   than no MED value.  This behavior resulted in path\
    \ selection\n   inconsistencies within an AS.  The current version of the BGP\n\
    \   specification [BGP4] removes ambiguities that existed in [RFC1771] by\n  \
    \ stating that if route n has no MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute, the lowest\n   possible\
    \ MULTI_EXIT_DISC value (i.e., 0) should be assigned to the\n   attribute.\n \
    \  It is apparent that different implementations and different versions\n   of\
    \ the BGP specification have been all over the map with\n   interpretation of\
    \ missing-MED.  For example, earlier versions of the\n   specification called\
    \ for a missing MED to be assigned the highest\n   possible MED value (i.e., 2^32-1).\n\
    \   In addition, some implementations have been shown to internally\n   employ\
    \ a maximum possible MED value (2^32-1) as an \"infinity\" metric\n   (i.e., the\
    \ MED value is used to tag routes as unfeasible); upon\n   receiving an update\
    \ with an MED value of 2^32-1, they would rewrite\n   the value to 2^32-2.  Subsequently,\
    \ the new MED value would be\n   propagated and could result in routing inconsistencies\
    \ or unintended\n   path selections.\n   As a result of implementation inconsistencies\
    \ and protocol revision\n   variances, many network operators today explicitly\
    \ reset (i.e., set\n   to zero or some other 'fixed' value) all MED values on\
    \ ingress to\n   conform to their internal routing policies (i.e., to include\
    \ policy\n   that requires that MED values of 0 and 2^32-1 not be used in\n  \
    \ configurations, whether the MEDs are directly computed or\n   configured), so\
    \ as not to have to rely on all their routers having\n   the same missing-MED\
    \ behavior.\n   Because implementations don't normally provide a mechanism to\
    \ disable\n   MED comparisons in the decision algorithm, \"not using MEDs\" usually\n\
    \   entails explicitly setting all MEDs to some fixed value upon ingress\n   to\
    \ the routing domain.  By assigning a fixed MED value consistently\n   to all\
    \ routes across the network, MEDs are a effectively a non-issue\n   in the decision\
    \ algorithm.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.3.  Comparing MEDs between Different Autonomous Systems\n   The MED was intended\
    \ to be used on external (inter-AS) links to\n   discriminate among multiple exit\
    \ or entry points to the same\n   neighboring AS.  However, a large number of\
    \ MED applications now\n   employ MEDs for the purpose of determining route preference\
    \ between\n   like routes received from different autonomous systems.\n   A large\
    \ number of implementations provide the capability to enable\n   comparison of\
    \ MEDs between routes received from different neighboring\n   autonomous systems.\
    \  While this capability has demonstrated some\n   benefit (e.g., that described\
    \ in [RFC3345]), operators should be wary\n   of the potential side effects of\
    \ enabling such a function.  The\n   deployment section below provides some examples\
    \ as to why this may\n   result in undesirable behavior.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.4.  MEDs, Route Reflection, and AS Confederations for BGP\n   In particular\
    \ configurations, the BGP scaling mechanisms defined in\n   \"BGP Route Reflection\
    \ - An Alternative to Full Mesh IBGP\" [RFC2796]\n   and \"Autonomous System Confederations\
    \ for BGP\" [RFC3065] will\n   introduce persistent BGP route oscillation [RFC3345].\
    \  The problem is\n   inherent in the way BGP works: a conflict exists between\
    \ information\n   hiding/hierarchy and the non-hierarchical selection process\
    \ imposed\n   by lack of total ordering caused by the MED rules.  Given current\n\
    \   practices, we see the problem manifest itself most frequently in the\n   context\
    \ of MED + route reflectors or confederations.\n   One potential way to avoid\
    \ this is by configuring inter-Member-AS or\n   inter-cluster IGP metrics higher\
    \ than intra-Member-AS IGP metrics\n   and/or using other tie-breaking policies\
    \ to avoid BGP route selection\n   based on incomparable MEDs.  Of course, IGP\
    \ metric constraints may be\n   unreasonably onerous for some applications.\n\
    \   Not comparing MEDs between multiple paths for a prefix learned from\n   different\
    \ adjacent autonomous systems, as discussed in section 2.3,\n   or not utilizing\
    \ MEDs at all, significantly decreases the probability\n   of introducing potential\
    \ route oscillation conditions into the\n   network.\n   Although perhaps \"legal\"\
    \ as far as current specifications are\n   concerned, modifying MED attributes\
    \ received on any type of IBGP\n   session (e.g., standard IBGP, EBGP sessions\
    \ between Member-ASes of a\n   BGP confederation, route reflection, etc.) is not\
    \ recommended.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Route Flap Damping and MED Churn
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Route Flap Damping and MED Churn\n   MEDs are often derived dynamically\
    \ from IGP metrics or additive costs\n   associated with an IGP metric to a given\
    \ BGP NEXT_HOP.  This\n   typically provides an efficient model for ensuring that\
    \ the BGP MED\n   advertised to peers, used to represent the best path to a given\n\
    \   destination within the network, is aligned with that of the IGP\n   within\
    \ a given AS.\n   The consequence with dynamically derived IGP-based MEDs is that\n\
    \   instability within an AS, or even on a single given link within the\n   AS,\
    \ can result in widespread BGP instability or BGP route\n   advertisement churn\
    \ that propagates across multiple domains.  In\n   short, if your MED \"flaps\"\
    \ every time your IGP metric flaps, your\n   routes are likely going to be suppressed\
    \ as a result of BGP Route\n   Flap Damping [RFC2439].\n   Employment of MEDs\
    \ may compound the adverse effects of BGP flap-\n   dampening behavior because\
    \ it may cause routes to be re-advertised\n   solely to reflect an internal topology\
    \ change.\n   Many implementations don't have a practical problem with IGP\n \
    \  flapping; they either latch their IGP metric upon first advertisement\n   or\
    \ employ some internal suppression mechanism.  Some implementations\n   regard\
    \ BGP attribute changes as less significant than route\n   withdrawals and announcements\
    \ to attempt to mitigate the impact of\n   this type of event.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Effects of MEDs on Update Packing Efficiency
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Effects of MEDs on Update Packing Efficiency\n   Multiple unfeasible routes\
    \ can be advertised in a single BGP Update\n   message.  The BGP4 protocol also\
    \ permits advertisement of multiple\n   prefixes with a common set of path attributes\
    \ to be advertised in a\n   single update message.  This is commonly referred\
    \ to as \"update\n   packing\".  When possible, update packing is recommended\
    \ as it\n   provides a mechanism for more efficient behavior in a number of\n\
    \   areas, including the following:\n      o Reduction in system overhead due\
    \ to generation or receipt of\n        fewer Update messages.\n      o Reduction\
    \ in network overhead as a result of fewer packets and\n        lower bandwidth\

    \ value.  As such, potential wide-scale variance in MED\n   values introduces\

    \   non-deterministic behavior as to whether or not the oldest route\n   would\
    \ truly be selected.\n   The reasoning for this is that older paths are presumably\
    \ more\n   stable, and thus preferable.  However, temporal behavior in route\n\

- title: 4.  Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Deployment Considerations\n   It has been discussed that accepting MEDs from\
    \ other autonomous\n   systems has the potential to cause traffic flow churns\
    \ in the\n   network.  Some implementations only ratchet down the MED and never\n\
    \   move it back up to prevent excessive churn.\n   However, if a session is reset,\
    \ the MEDs being advertised have the\n   potential of changing.  If a network\
    \ is relying on received MEDs to\n   route traffic properly, the traffic patterns\
    \ have the potential for\n   changing dramatically, potentially resulting in congestion\
    \ on the\n   network.  Essentially, accepting and routing traffic based on MEDs\n\
    \   allows other people to traffic engineer your network.  This may or\n   may\
    \ not be acceptable to you.\n   As previously discussed, many network operators\
    \ choose to reset MED\n   values on ingress.  In addition, many operators explicitly\
    \ do not\n   employ MED values of 0 or 2^32-1 in order to avoid inconsistencies\n\

- title: 4.1.  Comparing MEDs between Different Autonomous Systems
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Comparing MEDs between Different Autonomous Systems\n   Although the MED\
    \ was meant to be used only when comparing paths\n   received from different external\
    \ peers in the same AS, many\n   implementations provide the capability to compare\
    \ MEDs between\n   different autonomous systems as well.  AS operators often use\n\
    \   LOCAL_PREF to select the external preferences (primary, secondary\n   upstreams,\
    \ peers, customers, etc.), using MED instead of LOCAL_PREF\n   would possibly\
    \ lead to an inconsistent distribution of best routes,\n   as MED is compared\
    \ only after the AS_PATH length.\n   Though this may seem like a fine idea for\
    \ some configurations, care\n   must be taken when comparing MEDs between different\
    \ autonomous\n   systems.  BGP speakers often derive MED values by obtaining the\
    \ IGP\n   metric associated with reaching a given BGP NEXT_HOP within the local\n\
    \   AS.  This allows MEDs to reasonably reflect IGP topologies when\n   advertising\

  - "4.2.  Effects of Aggregation on MEDs\n   Another MED deployment consideration\
    \ involves the impact that\n   aggregation of BGP routing information has on MEDs.\
    \  Aggregates are\n   often generated from multiple locations in an AS in order\
    \ to\n   accommodate stability, redundancy, and other network design goals.\n\
    \   When MEDs are derived from IGP metrics associated with said\n   aggregates,\
    \ the MED value advertised to peers can result in very\n   suboptimal routing.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The MED was purposely designed to be a \"weak\"\
    \ metric that would only\n   be used late in the best-path decision process. \
    \ The BGP working\n   group was concerned that any metric specified by a remote\
    \ operator\n   would only affect routing in a local AS if no other preference\
    \ was\n   specified.  A paramount goal of the design of the MED was to ensure\n\
    \   that peers could not \"shed\" or \"absorb\" traffic for networks that\n  \
    \ they advertise.  As such, accepting MEDs from peers may in some sense\n   increase\
    \ a network's susceptibility to exploitation by peers.\n"
