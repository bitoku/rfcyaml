  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the use of the ChaCha stream cipher
    and\n   Poly1305 authenticator in version 1.2 or later of the Transport Layer\n
    \  Security (TLS) protocol [RFC5246] as well as version 1.2 or later of\n   the
    Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol [RFC6347].\n   ChaCha [CHACHA]
    is a stream cipher developed by D. J. Bernstein in\n   2008.  It is a refinement
    of Salsa20, which is one of the selected\n   ciphers in the eSTREAM portfolio
    [ESTREAM], and it was used as the\n   core of the SHA-3 finalist, BLAKE.\n   The
    variant of ChaCha used in this document has 20 rounds, a 96-bit\n   nonce, and
    a 256-bit key; it is referred to as \"ChaCha20\".  This is\n   the conservative
    variant (with respect to security) of the ChaCha\n   family and is described in
    [RFC7539].\n   Poly1305 [POLY1305] is a Wegman-Carter, one-time authenticator\n
    \  designed by D. J. Bernstein.  Poly1305 takes a 256-bit, one-time key\n   and
    a message, and it produces a 16-byte tag that authenticates the\n   message such
    that an attacker has a negligible chance of producing a\n   valid tag for an inauthentic
    message.  It is described in [RFC7539].\n   ChaCha and Poly1305 have both been
    designed for high performance in\n   software implementations.  They typically
    admit a compact\n   implementation that uses few resources and inexpensive operations,\n
    \  which makes them suitable on a wide range of architectures.  They\n   have
    also been designed to minimize leakage of information through\n   side-channels.\n
    \  Recent attacks [CBC-ATTACK] have indicated problems with the CBC-mode\n   cipher
    suites in TLS and DTLS, as well as issues with the only\n   supported stream cipher
    (RC4) [RC4-ATTACK].  While the existing\n   Authenticated Encryption with Associated
    Data (AEAD) cipher suites\n   (based on AES-GCM) address some of these issues,
    there are concerns\n   about their performance and ease of software implementation.\n
    \  Therefore, a new stream cipher to replace RC4 and address all the\n   previous
    issues is needed.  It is the purpose of this document to\n   describe a secure
    stream cipher for both TLS and DTLS that is\n   comparable to RC4 in speed on
    a wide range of platforms and can be\n   implemented easily without being vulnerable
    to software side-channel\n   attacks.\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  ChaCha20 Cipher Suites\n   The ChaCha20 and Poly1305 primitives are built
    into an AEAD algorithm\n   [RFC5116], AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305, as described in
    [RFC7539].  This\n   AEAD is incorporated into TLS and DTLS as specified in\n
    \  Section 6.2.3.3 of [RFC5246].\n   AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305 requires a 96-bit
    nonce, which is formed as\n   follows:\n   1.  The 64-bit record sequence number
    is serialized as an 8-byte,\n       big-endian value and padded on the left with
    four 0x00 bytes.\n   2.  The padded sequence number is XORed with the client_write_IV\n
    \      (when the client is sending) or server_write_IV (when the server\n       is
    sending).\n   In DTLS, the 64-bit seq_num is the 16-bit epoch concatenated with
    the\n   48-bit sequence_number.\n   This nonce construction is different from
    the one used with AES-GCM\n   in TLS 1.2 but matches the scheme expected to be
    used in TLS 1.3.\n   The nonce is constructed from the record sequence number
    and the\n   shared secret, both of which are known to the recipient.  The\n   advantage
    is that no per-record, explicit nonce need be transmitted,\n   which saves eight
    bytes per record and prevents implementations from\n   mistakenly using a random
    nonce.  Thus, in the terms of [RFC5246],\n   SecurityParameters.fixed_iv_length
    is twelve bytes and\n   SecurityParameters.record_iv_length is zero bytes.\n   The
    following cipher suites are defined:\n   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
    \  = {0xCC, 0xA8}\n   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 = {0xCC, 0xA9}\n
    \  TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256     = {0xCC, 0xAA}\n   TLS_PSK_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
    \        = {0xCC, 0xAB}\n   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256   = {0xCC,
    0xAC}\n   TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256     = {0xCC, 0xAD}\n   TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
    \    = {0xCC, 0xAE}\n   The DHE_RSA, ECDHE_RSA, ECDHE_ECDSA, PSK, ECDHE_PSK, DHE_PSK,
    and\n   RSA_PSK key exchanges for these cipher suites are unaltered; thus,\n   they
    are performed as defined in [RFC5246], [RFC4492], and [RFC5489].\n   The pseudorandom
    function (PRF) for all the cipher suites defined in\n   this document is the TLS
    PRF with SHA-256 [FIPS180-4] as the hash\n   function.\n"

  title: 3.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   ChaCha20 follows the same basic principle as
    Salsa20 [SALSA20SPEC], a\n   cipher with significant security review [SALSA20-SECURITY]
    [ESTREAM].\n   At the time of writing this document, there are no known significant\n
    \  security problems with either cipher, and ChaCha20 is shown to be\n   more
    resistant in certain attacks than Salsa20 [SALSA20-ATTACK].\n   Furthermore, ChaCha20
    was used as the core of the BLAKE hash\n   function, a SHA3 finalist, which has
    received considerable\n   cryptanalytic attention [NIST-SHA3].\n   Poly1305 is
    designed to ensure that forged messages are rejected with\n   a probability of
    1-(n/2^107), where n is the maximum length of the\n   input to Poly1305.  In the
    case of (D)TLS, this means a maximum\n   forgery probability of about 1 in 2^93.\n
    \  The cipher suites described in this document require that a nonce\n   never
    be repeated under the same key.  The design presented ensures\n   this by using
    the TLS sequence number, which is unique and does not\n   wrap [RFC5246].\n   It
    should be noted that AEADs, such as ChaCha20-Poly1305, are not\n   intended to
    hide the lengths of plaintexts.  When this document\n   speaks of side-channel
    attacks, it is not considering traffic\n   analysis, but rather timing and cache
    side-channels.  Traffic\n   analysis, while a valid concern, is outside the scope
    of the AEAD and\n   is being addressed elsewhere in future versions of TLS.\n
    \  Otherwise, this document should not introduce any additional security\n   considerations
    other than those that follow from the use of the\n   AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305 construction,
    thus the reader is directed to\n   the Security Considerations section of [RFC7539].\n"
