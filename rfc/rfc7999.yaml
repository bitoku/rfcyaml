- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Network infrastructures have been increasingly hampered\
    \ by DDoS\n   attacks.  In order to dampen the effects of these DDoS attacks,\
    \ IP\n   networks have offered blackholing with BGP [RFC4271] using various\n\
    \   mechanisms such as those described in [RFC3882] and [RFC5635].\n   DDoS attacks\
    \ targeting a certain IP address may cause congestion of\n   links used to connect\
    \ to adjacent networks.  In order to limit the\n   impact of such a scenario on\
    \ legitimate traffic, networks adopted a\n   mechanism called \"BGP blackholing\"\
    .  A network that wants to trigger\n   blackholing needs to understand the triggering\
    \ mechanism adopted by\n   its neighboring networks.  Different networks provide\
    \ different\n   mechanisms to trigger blackholing, including but not limited to\
    \ pre-\n   defined blackhole next-hop IP addresses, specific BGP communities,\
    \ or\n   out-of-band BGP sessions with a special BGP speaker.\n   Having several\
    \ different mechanisms to trigger blackholing in\n   different networks makes\
    \ it an unnecessarily complex, error-prone,\n   and cumbersome task for network\
    \ operators.  Therefore, a well-known\n   BGP community [RFC1997] is defined for\
    \ operational ease.\n   Having such a well-known BGP community for blackholing\
    \ also further\n   simplifies network operations because:\n   o  Implementing\
    \ and monitoring blackholing becomes easier when\n      implementation and operational\
    \ guides do not cover many variations\n      to trigger blackholing.\n   o  The\
    \ number of support requests from customers about how to trigger\n      blackholing\
    \ in a particular neighboring network will be reduced as\n      the codepoint\
    \ for common blackholing mechanisms is unified and\n      well-known.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" are to\n   be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] only\
    \ when they appear in all\n   upper case.  They may also appear in lower case\
    \ or mixed case as\n   English words, without normative meaning.\n"

- title: 3.1.  IP Prefix Announcements with BLACKHOLE Community Attached
  contents:
  - "3.1.  IP Prefix Announcements with BLACKHOLE Community Attached\n   Accepting\
    \ and honoring the BLACKHOLE community, or ignoring it, is a\n   choice that is\
    \ made by each operator.  This community MAY be used in\n   all bilateral and\
    \ multilateral BGP deployment scenarios.  In a\n   bilateral peering relationship,\
    \ use of the BLACKHOLE community MUST\n   be agreed upon by the two networks before\
    \ advertising it.  In a\n   multilateral peering relationship, the decision to\
    \ honor or ignore\n   the BLACKHOLE community is to be made according to the operator's\n\
    \   routing policy.  The community SHOULD be ignored, if it is received\n   by\
    \ a network that it not using it.\n   When a network is under DDoS duress, it\
    \ MAY announce an IP prefix\n   covering the victim's IP address(es) for the purpose\
    \ of signaling to\n   neighboring networks that any traffic destined for these\
    \ IP\n   address(es) should be discarded.  In such a scenario, the network\n \
    \  operator SHOULD attach the BLACKHOLE community.\n   The BLACKHOLE community\
    \ MAY also be used as one of the trigger\n   communities in a destination-based\
    \ Remote Triggered Blackhole (RTBH)\n   [RFC5635] configuration.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Local Scope of Blackholes
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Local Scope of Blackholes\n   A BGP speaker receiving an announcement tagged\
    \ with the BLACKHOLE\n   community SHOULD add the NO_ADVERTISE or NO_EXPORT community\
    \ as\n   defined in [RFC1997], or a similar community, to prevent propagation\n\
    \   of the prefix outside the local AS.  The community to prevent\n   propagation\
    \ SHOULD be chosen according to the operator's routing\n   policy.\n   Unintentional\
    \ leaking of more specific IP prefixes to neighboring\n   networks can have adverse\
    \ effects.  Extreme caution should be used\n   when purposefully propagating IP\
    \ prefixes tagged with the BLACKHOLE\n   community outside the local routing domain,\
    \ unless policy explicitly\n   aims at doing just that.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Accepting Blackholed IP Prefixes
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Accepting Blackholed IP Prefixes\n   It has been observed in provider networks\
    \ running BGP that\n   announcements of IP prefixes longer than /24 for IPv4 and\
    \ /48 for\n   IPv6 are usually not accepted on the Internet (see Section 6.1.3\
    \ of\n   [RFC7454]).  However, blackhole prefix length should be as long as\n\
    \   possible in order to limit the impact of discarding traffic for\n   adjacent\
    \ IP space that is not under DDoS duress.  The blackhole\n   prefix length is\
    \ typically as specific as possible, /32 for IPv4 or\n   /128 for IPv6.\n   BGP\
    \ speakers in a bilateral peering relationship using the BLACKHOLE\n   community\
    \ MUST only accept and honor BGP announcements carrying the\n   BLACKHOLE community\
    \ under the two following conditions:\n   o  The announced prefix is covered by\
    \ an equal or shorter prefix that\n      the neighboring network is authorized\
    \ to advertise.\n   o  The receiving party agreed to honor the BLACKHOLE community\
    \ on the\n      particular BGP session.\n   In topologies with a route server\
    \ or other multilateral peering\n   relationships, BGP speakers SHOULD accept\
    \ and honor BGP announcements\n   under the same conditions.\n   An operator MUST\
    \ ensure that origin validation techniques (such as\n   the one described in [RFC6811])\
    \ do not inadvertently block legitimate\n   announcements carrying the BLACKHOLE\
    \ community.\n   The BLACKHOLE community is not intended to be used with Network\
    \ Layer\n   Reachability Information (NLRI) [RFC5575] to distribute traffic flow\n\
    \   specifications.\n   The error handling for this community follows the process\
    \ in\n   [RFC7606] that causes a malformed community to be treated as\n   withdrawn.\n\
    \   Operators are encouraged to store all BGP updates in their network\n   carrying\
    \ the BLACKHOLE community for long-term analysis or internal\n   audit purposes.\n"
- title: 4.  Vendor Implementation Recommendations
  contents:
  - "4.  Vendor Implementation Recommendations\n   Without an explicit configuration\
    \ directive set by the operator,\n   network elements SHOULD NOT discard traffic\
    \ destined towards IP\n   prefixes that are tagged with the BLACKHOLE community.\
    \  The operator\n   is expected to explicitly configure the network element to\
    \ honor the\n   BLACKHOLE community in a way that is compliant with the operator's\n\
    \   routing policy.\n   Vendors MAY provide a shorthand keyword in their configuration\n\
    \   language to reference the well-known BLACKHOLE community attribute\n   value.\
    \  The suggested string to be used is \"blackhole\".\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   The IANA has registered BLACKHOLE in the \"BGP Well-known\
    \ Communities\"\n   registry.\n      BLACKHOLE (= 0xFFFF029A)\n   The low-order\
    \ two octets in decimal are 666, a value commonly\n   associated with BGP blackholing\
    \ among network operators.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   BGP contains no specific mechanism to prevent\
    \ the unauthorized\n   modification of information by the forwarding agent.  This\
    \ allows\n   routing information to be modified or removed; it also allows false\n\
    \   information to be added by forwarding agents.  Recipients of routing\n   information\
    \ are not able to detect this modification.  BGPsec\n   [BGPSEC] does not resolve\
    \ this situation.  Even when BGPsec is in\n   place, a forwarding agent can alter,\
    \ add, or remove BGP communities.\n   The unauthorized addition of the BLACKHOLE\
    \ community to an IP prefix\n   by an adversary may cause a denial-of-service\
    \ attack based on denial\n   of reachability.\n   In order to further limit the\
    \ impact of unauthorized BGP\n   announcements carrying the BLACKHOLE community,\
    \ the receiving BGP\n   speaker SHOULD verify by applying strict filtering (see\n\
    \   Section 6.2.1.1.2 of [RFC7454]) that the peer announcing the prefix\n   is\
    \ authorized to do so.  If not, the BGP announcement should be\n   filtered.\n\
    \   BGP announcements carrying the BLACKHOLE community should only be\n   accepted\
    \ and honored if the neighboring network is authorized to\n   advertise the prefix.\
    \  The method of validating announcements is to\n   be chosen according to the\
    \ operator's routing policy.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that operators use best common\
    \ practices to protect\n   their BGP sessions, such as the ones in [RFC7454].\n"
