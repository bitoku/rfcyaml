  - '        SIP "cause" URI Parameter for Service Number Translation

    '
- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   RFC 4458 (regarding SIP URIs for applications) defines a \"cause\"\
    \ URI\n   parameter, which may appear in the Request-URI of a SIP request, that\n\
    \   is used to indicate a reason why the request arrived to the User\n   Agent\
    \ Server (UAS) receiving the message.  This document updates RFC\n   4458 by creating\
    \ a new predefined value for the \"cause\" URI parameter\n   to cover service\
    \ number translation for cases of retargeting due to\n   specific service action\
    \ leading to the translation of a called\n   service access number.  This document\
    \ also provides guidance, which\n   was missing in RFC 4458, for using the \"\
    cause\" URI parameter within\n   the History-Info header field, since this use\
    \ is mandatory in some IP\n   networks' implementations.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction, Terminology, and Overview
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction, Terminology, and Overview\n   [RFC4458] defines a mechanism\
    \ to identify retargeting due to call\n   forwarding supplementary services. \
    \ The \"cause\" URI parameter in the\n   target URI identifies the reason for\
    \ retargeting and has defined\n   values equivalent to the TDM (Time Division\
    \ Multiplexing) Redirecting\n   Reasons [ITU-T_Q.763].  The concept of \"retargeting\"\
    \ is defined in\n   [RFC7044].\n   In the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN\
    \ ) / Integrated\n   Services Digital Network (ISDN), there is another kind of\
    \ retargeting\n   introduced by the Intelligent Network (IN) services based on\
    \ a\n   translation of the called number as mentioned in [ITU-T_Q.1214].\n   Indeed,\
    \ IN aims to ease the introduction of new services (i.e.,\n   Universal Personal\
    \ Telecommunication (UPT), Virtual Private Network\n   (VPN), Freephone, etc.)\
    \ based on greater flexibility and new\n   capabilities as described in [ITU-T_I.312_Q.1201].\
    \  For these IN\n   services, ISDN User Part (ISUP) introduced the \"called IN\
    \ number\" and\n   the \"original called IN number\" parameters to capture the\
    \ information\n   of the requested service access number prior its translation\n\
    \   [ITU-T_Q.763].\n   The term \"service access number\" is used in this specification\
    \ to\n   refer to the dialable number by which a specific service is reached.\n\
    \   This special number is not a globally routable number; therefore, it\n   needs\
    \ to be translated into a routable SIP or tel URI to process the\n   session establishment.\n\
    \   This specification proposes a solution to allow the identification of\n  \
    \ well-known services, such as premium or toll-free services that\n   perform\
    \ service access number translation, and to enable interworking\n   with SIP signaling\
    \ with the ISUP called IN number and original called\n   IN number parameters.\n\
    \   The mechanism will allow a SIP network to insert and convey the\n   service\
    \ access number requested before its translation to the final\n   destination.\n\
    \   In order to provide full call forwarding or access number translation\n  \
    \ services, usage of the \"cause\" URI parameter is only relevant within\n   the\
    \ History-Info header field defined in [RFC7044].  Because this\n   relation has\
    \ not been described in [RFC4458], this document provides\n   guidance for using\
    \ the \"cause\" URI parameter in conjunction with the\n   History-Info header\
    \ field.\n   This document also answers a need expressed by the Third Generation\n\
    \   Partnership Project (3GPP) [TS.3GPP.24.229] to identify the service\n   access\
    \ number.  The procedures it defines are intended for networks\n   that use 3GPP-defined\
    \ services.  Their use is undefined for other\n   networks.\n"
- title: 2.  Solution
  contents:
  - "2.  Solution\n   A new value for the \"cause\" URI parameter of the 'sip:' or\
    \ 'sips:'\n   URI schemes is defined for the \"Service number translation\" use\
    \ case.\n   This value may be used in a 'sip:' or 'sips:' URI inserted in the\n\
    \   Request-URI and in the History-Info header field [RFC7044] when the\n   URI\
    \ is issued from a retargeting or a service access number\n   translation by a\
    \ specific service similar to PSTN/ISDN IN services\n   that is not a call forwarding\
    \ service.\n   As defined in [RFC4458], the \"cause\" URI parameter must be encoded\
    \ in\n   the new target URI when generated by the service.\n   The ABNF grammar\
    \ [RFC5234] for the cause-param and target-param\n   parameters from [RFC4458]\
    \ is summarized below (including updates\n   described in [Err1409]).  The Status-Code\
    \ is defined in [RFC3261].\n   target-param = \"target=\" pvalue\n   cause-param\
    \ = \"cause=\" Status-Code\n   The following value for this URI parameter is added\
    \ to the existing\n   ones:\n                +---------------------------------+-------+\n\
    \                |         Cause                   | Value |\n               \
    \ +---------------------------------+-------+\n                | Service number\
    \ translation      | 380   |\n                +---------------------------------+-------+\n"
- title: 3.  Guidelines
  contents:
  - "3.  Guidelines\n   In order to help implementation of this solution for conveyance\
    \ of\n   the service access number, this document proposes guidance for usage\n\
    \   of the \"cause\" URI parameter: guidance for the usage of the \"cause\"\n\
    \   URI parameter in the request history information (in Section 3.1) and\n  \
    \ guidance for processing a service number translation service using\n   the new\
    \ \"cause\" URI parameter value (in Section 3.2).\n"
- title: 3.1.  Interaction with Request History Information
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Interaction with Request History Information\n   The History-Info header\
    \ field defined in [RFC7044] specifies a means\n   of providing the UAS and User\
    \ Agent Client (UAC) with information\n   about the retargeting of a request.\
    \  This information includes the\n   initial Request-URI and any retargeted URIs.\
    \  This information is\n   placed in History-Info headers as the request is retargeted\
    \ and, upon\n   reaching the UAS, is returned in certain responses.  The History-Info\n\
    \   header field enables many enhanced services by providing the\n   information\
    \ as to how and why a SIP request arrives at a specific\n   application or user\
    \ and to keep this information throughout the\n   signaling path even when successive\
    \ applications are involved.\n   When a proxy inserts a URI containing the \"\
    cause\" URI parameter\n   defined in [RFC4458] into the Request-URI of a forwarded\
    \ request (per\n   [RFC7044]), the proxy must also copy this new Request-URI within\
    \ a\n   History-Info header field entry into the forwarded request; thus, the\n\
    \   URI in that entry includes the \"cause\" URI parameter.  Therefore,\n   even\
    \ if the Request-URI is replaced as a result of rerouting by a\n   downstream\
    \ proxy, the History-Info header field will still contain\n   these parameters,\
    \ which can be of use to the UAS.  Note that if a\n   proxy does not support generation\
    \ of the History-Info header field or\n   if a downstream proxy removes the History-Info\
    \ header fields, an\n   application will only have access to the \"cause\" URI\
    \ parameter if the\n   request is not subsequently retargeted (i.e., it will be\
    \ contained\n   only in the Request-URI in the incoming request).  The implications\n\
    \   of the solution are further discussed in Section 3.2.\n   In order to be able\
    \ to filter specific entries among the history\n   information, header field parameters\
    \ have been defined in [RFC7044].\n   In particular, the \"mp\" and \"rc\" header\
    \ field parameters have the\n   following definitions:\n   o  When the new target\
    \ was determined based on a mapping to a user\n      other than the target user\
    \ associated with the Request-URI being\n      retargeted, the \"mp\" header field\
    \ parameter is added.  This allows\n      the identification of retargets that\
    \ are the result of an\n      application decision on a user's behalf and also\
    \ retargets that\n      are the result of an internal decision made by an application.\n\
    \   o  The \"rc\" header field parameter is added when the new target\n      represents\
    \ a change in Request-URI, while the target user remains\n      the same.\n  \
    \ These header field parameters can be used in conjunction with the new\n   \"\
    cause\" URI parameter for certain applications, an example of which\n   is provided\
    \ in Section 4.\n   When using the History-Info header field in conjunction with\
    \ the\n   \"cause\" URI parameter in a Request-URI, it is important to consider\n\
    \   that the \"cause\" URI parameter is not the same parameter as the\n   \"cause\"\
    \ header field parameter included in the Reason header\n   [RFC3326].  The \"\
    cause\" header field parameter of the Reason header\n   field should be added\
    \ to a History-Info entry only when the\n   retargeting is due to a received SIP\
    \ response.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Handling and Processing the Service Number Translation "cause" URI
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Handling and Processing the Service Number Translation \"cause\" URI\n\
    \      Parameter Value\n   At the Application Server:\n      When an application\
    \ receiving a request that is addressed to a\n      service access number changes\
    \ the Request-URI into a routable\n      number, it should insert within this\
    \ new Request-URI a \"cause\" URI\n      parameter value set to 380 \"Service\
    \ number translation\".\n      Following the process described in [RFC7044], the\
    \ application\n      server adds a new History-Info header field entry including\
    \ the\n      new Request-URI value including the \"cause\" URI parameter.  It\
    \ is\n      also possible for an application server to add a \"target\" URI\n\
    \      parameter as defined in [RFC4458] with the initial value of the\n     \
    \ Request-URI received by the application server.\n   Note that if the new Request-URI\
    \ is further replaced by a downstream\n   proxy for any reason and if the History-Info\
    \ header field is not\n   supported, the information of the service access number\
    \ initially\n   requested would be lost.  Thus, it is strongly recommended to\
    \ support\n   the History-Info header field all along the signaling path.\n  \
    \ At the UAS:\n      When the UAS receiving the request wants to retrieve the\
    \ service\n      access number by which it has been reached, first it should look\n\
    \      for the \"cause\" URI parameter value 380 in the History-Info header\n\
    \      field.  This History-Info entry should also contain an \"mp\" or\n    \
    \  \"rc\" header field parameter so that the UAS can find the requested\n    \
    \  service number in the History-Info entry having an index parameter\n      value\
    \ that matches this \"mp\" or \"rc\" header field parameter value.\n      If,\
    \ for any reason, there is no \"mp\" or \"rc\" header field\n      parameter in\
    \ the identified History-Info entry, the UAS can find\n      the requested service\
    \ number in the preceding History-Info entry.\n   If the History-Info header is\
    \ not supported or has been removed by a\n   proxy for any reason, the UAS might\
    \ be able to find the requested\n   service access number before translation in\
    \ either of the following\n   ways, but there is no guarantee:\n   o  If the UAS\
    \ is the direct target of the request coming from the\n      application, the\
    \ UAS ought to be able to find the service access\n      number in the \"target\"\
    \ URI parameter of the Request-URI if there\n      is also a \"cause\" URI parameter\
    \ set to 380 in this Request-URI.\n   o  If there is no \"cause\" URI parameter\
    \ set to 380 in the Request-URI\n      and there is no History-Info header field,\
    \ the UAS will not be\n      able to reliably retrieve the service access number\
    \ before\n      translation.  Some existing implementations are known to extract\n\
    \      the number from the To header field.  While that approach may work\n  \
    \    in some situations, it will not work in the general case because\n      the\
    \ To header field value is sometimes changed by intermediaries,\n      and such\
    \ a change is not always detectable.\n"

    \ as described in [RFC3323], the \"cause\" URI parameter must be\n   removed from\
    \ the Request-URI to maintain the network-provided privacy\n   requested.  Privacy\
    \ of the parameters, when they form part of a URI\n   within the History-Info\
    \ header field, is covered in [RFC7044].\n"
