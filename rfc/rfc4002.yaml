  - "1.  Introduction\n   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC 3761 [2]) is a system that
    transforms\n   E.164 numbers [3] into domain names and that then uses DNS (Domain\n
    \  Name Service, RFC 1034 [4]) services such as delegation through NS\n   records
    and NAPTR records to look up what services are available for\n   a specific domain
    name.\n   This document registers 'Enumservices' according to the guidelines\n
    \  given in RFC 3761 [2] to be used for provisioning in the services\n   field
    of an NAPTR [7] resource record to indicate what class of\n   functionality a
    given end point offers.  The registration is defined\n   within the DDDS (Dynamic
    Delegation Discovery System [5][6][7][8][9])\n   hierarchy, for use with the \"E2U\"
    DDDS Application, defined in RFC\n   3761 [2].\n   The following 'Enumservices'
    are registered with this document: 'web'\n   and 'ft'.  These share a common feature
    in that they each indicate\n   that the functionality of the given end points
    and the associated\n   resources are primarily sources of information.\n   According
    to RFC 3761 [2], the 'Enumservice' registered must be able\n   to function as
    a selection mechanism when one chooses between one\n   NAPTR resource record and
    another.  This means that the registration\n   MUST specify what is expected when
    that NAPTR record is used, and the\n   URI scheme that is the outcome of use.\n
    \  Therefore an 'Enumservice' acts as a hint, indicating the kind of\n   service
    with which the URI constructed by using the regexp field is\n   associated.  More
    than one 'Enumservice' can be included within a\n   single NAPTR; this indicates
    that there is more than one service that\n   can be achieved by using the associated
    URI scheme.\n   The common thread with this set of definitions is that they reflect\n
    \  the kind of service that the end user will hope to achieve with the\n   communication
    by using the associated URI.\n   The services specified here are NOT intended
    to specify the protocol\n   or even the method of connection that MUST be used
    to achieve each\n   service.  Instead, we define the kind of interactive behavior
    that an\n   end user will expect, leaving the end system to decide (based on\n
    \  policies outside the scope of this specification) how to execute the\n   service.\n
    \  As the same URI scheme may be used for different services (e.g.,\n   'tel:')
    and the same kind of service may use different URI schemes\n   (e.g., for VoIP,
    'sip:', 'h323:', and 'tel:' may be used), it is\n   necessary in some cases to
    specify the service and the URI scheme\n   used.\n   The service parameters defined
    in RFC 3761 [2] therefore allow a\n   'type' and a 'subtype' to be specified.
    \ Within this set of\n   specifications, it is assumed that the 'type' (being
    the more generic\n   term) defines the service and the 'subtype' defines the URI
    scheme.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   As used by ENUM, DNS is a global, distributed
    database.  Thus any\n   information stored there is visible to anyone anonymously.
    \ Although\n   this is not qualitatively different from publication in a telephone\n
    \  directory, it does expose the data subject to having \"their\"\n   information
    collected automatically without any indication that this\n   has been done, or
    by whom.\n   Data harvesting by third parties is often used to generate lists
    of\n   targets for unrequested information; in short, it is used to address\n
    \  \"spam\".  Anyone who uses a Web-archived mailing list is aware that\n   the
    volume of \"spam\" email they receive increases when they post to\n   the mailing
    list; publication of a telephone number in ENUM is no\n   different and may be
    used to send \"junk faxes\" or \"junk SMS\", for\n   example.\n   Many mailing
    list users have more than one email address and use\n   \"sacrificial\" email
    accounts when they post to these lists to help\n   filter out unrequested emails.
    \ This is not so easy with published\n   telephone numbers; the PSTN E.164 number
    assignment process is much\n   more involved, and usually a single E.164 number
    (or a fixed range of\n   numbers) is associated with each PSTN access.  Thus,
    providing a\n   \"sacrificial\" phone number in any publication is not possible.\n
    \  Due to the implications of publishing data on a globally accessible\n   database,
    as a principle the data subject MUST give explicit informed\n   consent when data
    is published in ENUM.\n   In addition, the data subject should be made aware that,
    due to\n   storage of such data during harvesting by third parties, removal of\n
    \  the data from publication will not remove any copies that have been\n   taken;
    in effect, any publication may be permanent.\n   However, regulations in many
    regions will require that the data\n   subject can at any time request that the
    data is removed from\n   publication, and that consent for its publication is
    explicitly\n   confirmed at regular intervals.\n   The user SHOULD be asked to
    confirm opening a web page or starting an\n   ftp session (particularly if the
    ftp client is configured to send the\n   user's email address as an \"anonymous\"
    user password).\n   Using a web:http or ft:ftp service is not secure, so the user
    should\n   apply the same caution when entering personal data as they would do\n
    \  if using a client application started with any other method.\n   Although this
    is not a feature of ENUM or these Enumservices, the\n   ENUM-using application
    on the end system may appear different from\n   the user's \"normal\" browser,
    so the user SHOULD receive an indication\n   of whether their communication is
    secured.\n   As evaluating a web page can involve execution of embedded (or\n
    \  linked) content that may include executable code, evaluating a web\n   URL
    involves risks.  If automatic evaluation of a web link were to be\n   used, the
    querying user would be exposed to risks associated with\n   that automatic download
    and execution of content.  Thus, the client\n   MUST ask the querying user for
    confirmation before evaluating the web\n   URL; the client MUST NOT download and
    evaluate the web content\n   automatically.\n   An analysis of threats specific
    to the dependence of ENUM on the DNS,\n   (threats against which are covered in
    [14]) and the applicability of\n   DNSSEC [13] to these, is provided in RFC 3761
    [2].\n"
