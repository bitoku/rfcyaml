  - "                         LONDON NODE IS NOW UP\n   The London node of the ARPANET\
    \ has been on the Net (Address 42) since\n   early September.  It consists of\
    \ a TIP (Address 170) and, at present,\n   a local HOST (0), a PDP-9, which front-ends\
    \ the Rutherford High\n   Energy Laboratory 360/195 located 60 miles from London\
    \ and connect to\n   it by a 2.4 Kbps line.  The specific details of the 360 will\
    \ soon\n   appear in the Resource Notebook, but, in brief, it has 2 megabytes\
    \ of\n   fast store (750ns), a fixed head disk and a large number of other\n \
    \  peripherals.  It operates under OS/MVT release 21.7 and HASP II\n   version\
    \ 3.1, with a locally written message switching system MAST and\n   an interactive\
    \ editor ELECTRIC.  In addition to the local hardware,\n   it supports about 20\
    \ remote workstations, which are, in many cases\n   GEC 2050s simulating IBM 1130s.\
    \  Eventually, other Hosts will be\n   attached to the Very Distant Host Interface\
    \ (Address 234).\n   The PDP-9 at the Institute of Computer Science also simulates\
    \ a 1130\n   with 2 card readers, 2 card punches, two line printers, three MAST\n\
    \   consoles, and a system console.  It has a 16K (18 bit) words store, a\n  \
    \ 256K word drum and a number of devices usually attached by modem\n   interfaces.\
    \  The 1130 simulator software has been interfaced to an\n   ARPA system, which,\
    \ at present, has IMP-HOST, HOST-HOST, ICP, and\n   TELNET protocols.  The TELNET\
    \ link is initially to the PDP-9 from\n   whence the user may login to the 360\
    \ provided one of the two MAST\n   ports is available (the third being for local\
    \ use).  The access is to\n   ELECTRIC, and the user may enter and edit files,\
    \ submit them to the\n   batch stream, and inspect the output interactively from\
    \ a terminal.\n   The facilities will be extended soon to allow the printing of\
    \ jobs at\n   TIPS and later the RJE and FTP protocols will be implemented.\n\
    \   The 360 is available for limited experimental use, and a free login\n   facility\
    \ has been provided (GUEST).  This account has a very limited\n   allowance (currently,\
    \ 1min CPU time/week), and is designed only for\n   demonstration purposes.\n\
    \   All jobs under this account must be Class X, which has a maximum run\n   time\
    \ of 10secs.  Proper accounts, for which there will be no charge,\n   can be arranged\
    \ for appropriate users by contacting KIRSTEIN@ISI.  It\n   is not planned, at\
    \ present, to make the 360/195 a normal service\n   HOST, like for example, the\
    \ CCN machine.  However, the machine will\n   be made available for cooperative\
    \ projects involving a US group and\n   an interested party in the UK.  Of particular\
    \ interest to us are\n   applications in Network measurements, high energy physics,\
    \ and\n   accelerator design, though other projects would be considered.\n   Primitive\
    \ HELP facilities exist on both the PDP-9 and the 360, and\n   they are accessed\
    \ by %H and TYPE JB=HELP, respectively.  Up to date\n   details will be given\
    \ in the message obtained on connecting to the\n   PDP-9 and in the PDP-9 Help\
    \ file.\n   ... A typical scenario is attached.\n   The intention is to keep the\
    \ PDP-9/360 available as a HOST between\n   19.00 and 09.00 local time, as well\
    \ as a number of periods during the\n   day (the local time is 8 or 9 hours ahead\
    \ of California, and 5 hours\n   ahead of the East Coast).  There will be no operator\
    \ available on the\n   PDP-9, although during the day and at least the early part\
    \ of the\n   evening, there will be users in the computer room who will give\n\
    \   assistance where necessary.  The \"operator's console\" is a Teletype,\n \
    \  so any messages sent during the night will be read in the morning,\n   and\
    \ we will try to send replies to all queries (if you tell us where\n   to reply\
    \ to Network mail for our site may be send to KRISTEIN@ISI, or\n   to myself (IDENT=AVS)\
    \ at the NIC.  Connection problems should be\n   referred to Peter Higginson (NIC\
    \ ident = PLH).\n   ... Enc.\n   HELLO 315\n   @1 42\n   LOGGER\n    OPEN\n  \
