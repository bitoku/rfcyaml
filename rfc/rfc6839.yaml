  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC3023] created the +xml suffix convention that can be\
    \ used when\n   defining names for media types whose representation uses XML\n\
    \   underneath.  That is, they could have been successfully parsed as if\n   the\
    \ media type had been application/xml in addition to their being\n   parsed as\
    \ their media type that is using the +xml suffix.  [RFC6838]\n   defines the media\
    \ type \"Structured Syntax Suffix Registry\" to be used\n   for such structured\
    \ syntax suffixes.\n   A variety of structured syntax suffixes have already been\
    \ used in\n   some media type registrations, in particular \"+json\", \"+der\"\
    ,\n   \"+fastinfoset\", and \"+wbxml\".  This document defines and registers\n\
    \   these structured syntax suffixes in the Structured Syntax Suffix\n   Registry,\
    \ along with \"+ber\" and \"+zip\".  In addition, this document\n   updates [RFC3023]\
    \ to formally register the \"+xml\" structured syntax\n   suffix according to\
    \ the procedure defined in [RFC6838].\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  When to Use These Structured Syntax Suffixes
  contents:
  - "2.  When to Use These Structured Syntax Suffixes\n   Each of the structured syntax\
    \ suffixes defined in this document is\n   appropriate for use when the media\
    \ type identifies the semantics of\n   the protocol payload.  That is, knowing\
    \ the semantics of the specific\n   media type provides for more specific processing\
    \ of the content than\n   that afforded by generic processing of the underlying\
    \ representation.\n   At the same time, using the suffix allows receivers of the\
    \ media\n   types to do generic processing of the underlying representation in\n\
    \   cases where\n      they do not need to perform special handling of the particular\n\
    \      semantics of the exact media type, and\n      there is no special knowledge\
    \ needed by such a generic processor\n      in order to parse that underlying\
    \ representation other than what\n      would be needed to parse any example of\
    \ that underlying\n      representation.\n"

    \   review all previously-registered xxx/yyy+<suffix> media types as to\n   whether\
    \ they might be affected by the updated +<suffix> registration.\n   Because the\
    \ generic fragment identifier processing rules take\n   precedence over media-type-specific\
    \ rules, introducing new or\n   changing existing definitions may break the existing\
    \ registrations of\n   specific media types, as well as particular implementations\
    \ of\n   applications that process affected media types.  Such changes can\n \
    \  introduce interoperability and security issues.\n   When updating the fragment\
    \ identifier processing rules for a specific\n   xxx/yyy+<suffix> media type,\
    \ care should be taken to review the\n   generic fragment identifier processing\
    \ rules for the +<suffix>\n   registration and not introduce any conflicts.  Because\
    \ the generic\n   fragment identifier processing rules take precedence over media-type-\n\
    \   specific rules, such conflicting processing requirements should be\n   ignored\
    \ by an implementation, but such conflicts can introduce\n   interoperability\
    \ and security issues.\n   Note that [FRAGID-BP] provides additional advice to\
    \ designers of\n   fragment identifier rules for media type suffixes and specific\
    \ media\n   types.\n"
