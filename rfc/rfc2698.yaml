  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The Two Rate Three Color Marker (trTCM) meters an IP packet\
    \ stream\n   and marks its packets either green, yellow, or red.  A packet is\n\
    \   marked red if it exceeds the Peak Information Rate (PIR).  Otherwise\n   it\
    \ is marked either yellow or green depending on whether it exceeds\n   or doesn't\
    \ exceed the Committed Information Rate (CIR).  The trTCM is\n   useful, for example,\
    \ for ingress policing of a service, where a peak\n   rate needs to be enforced\
    \ separately from a committed rate.\n   The Meter meters each packet and passes\
    \ the packet and the metering\n   result to the Marker:\n                    \
    \        +------------+\n                            |   Result   |\n        \
    \                    |            V\n                        +-------+    +--------+\n\

    \    |        |\n                        +-------+    +--------+\n   The Meter\
    \ operates in one of two modes.  In the Color-Blind mode, the\n   Meter assumes\
    \ that the packet stream is uncolored.  In the Color-\n   Aware mode the Meter\
    \ assumes that some preceding entity has pre-\n   colored the incoming packet\
    \ stream so that each packet is either\n   green, yellow, or red.  The details\
    \ of the pre-coloring process,\n   including handling of error scenarios, and\
    \ how the Meter determines\n   the color of a pre-colored packet are DS domain\
    \ specific and outside\n   the scope of this document.\n   The Marker (re)colors\
    \ an IP packet according to the results of the\n   Meter.  The color is coded\
    \ in the DS field [RFC2474] of the packet in\n   a PHB specific manner (see section\
    \ 4 for an example).\n   A companion document [RFC2697] describes another three\
    \ color marker,\n   called a Single Rate Three Color Maker (srTCM), where packets\
    \ are\n   marked based on a single rate and two burst sizes.\n"
- title: 2. Configuration
  contents:
  - "2. Configuration\n   The trTCM is configured by setting its mode and by assigning\
    \ values\n   to four traffic parameters: a Peak Information Rate (PIR) and its\n\
    \   associated Peak Burst Size (PBS) and a Committed Information Rate\n   (CIR)\
    \ and its associated Committed Burst Size (CBS).\n   The PIR and CIR are measured\
    \ in bytes of IP packets per second, i.e.,\n   it includes the IP header, but\
    \ not link specific headers.  The PIR\n   must be equal to or greater than the\
    \ CIR.\n   The PBS and the CBS and are measured in bytes and both of them must\n\
    \   be configured to be greater than 0.  It is recommended that they be\n   configured\
    \ to be equal to or greater than the size of the largest\n   possible IP packet\
    \ in the stream.\n"
- title: 3. Metering
  contents:
  - "3. Metering\n   The behavior of the Meter is specified in terms of its mode and\
    \ two\n   token buckets, P and C, with rates PIR and CIR, respectively.  The\n\
    \   maximum size of the token bucket P is PBS and the maximum size of the\n  \
    \ token bucket C is CBS.\n   The token buckets P and C are initially (at time\
    \ 0) full, i.e., the\n   token count Tp(0) = PBS and the token count Tc(0) = CBS.\
    \  Thereafter,\n   the token count Tp is incremented by one PIR times per second\
    \ up to\n   PBS and the token count Tc is incremented by one CIR times per second\n\
    \   up to CBS.\n   When a packet of size B bytes arrives at time t, the following\n\
    \   happens if the trTCM is configured to operate in the Color-Blind\n   mode:\n\
    \     o If Tp(t)-B < 0, the packet is red, else\n     o if Tc(t)-B < 0, the packet\
    \ is yellow and Tp is decremented by B,\n       else\n     o the packet is green\
    \ and both Tp and Tc are decremented by B.\n   When a packet of size B bytes arrives\
    \ at time t, the following\n   happens if the trTCM is configured to operate in\
    \ the Color-Aware\n   mode:\n     o If the packet has been precolored as red or\
    \ if Tp(t)-B < 0, the\n       packet is red, else\n     o if the packet has been\
    \ precolored as yellow or if Tc(t)-B < 0,\n       the packet is yellow and Tp\
    \ is decremented by B, else\n     o the packet is green and both Tp and Tc are\
    \ decremented by B.\n   The actual implementation of a Meter doesn't need to be\
    \ modeled\n   according to the above formal specification.\n"
- title: 4. Marking
  contents:
  - "4. Marking\n   The Marker reflects the metering result by setting the DS field\
    \ of\n   the packet to a particular codepoint.  In case of the AF PHB\n   [RFC2597],\
    \ the color can be coded as the drop precedence of the\n   packet.\n"
- title: 5. Service Example
  contents:
  - "5. Service Example\n   The trTCM can be used to mark a IP packet stream in a\
    \ service, where\n   different, decreasing levels of assurances (either absolute\
    \ or\n   relative) are given to packets which are green, yellow, or red.  For\n\
    \   example, a service may discard all red packets, because they exceeded\n  \
    \ the peak rate, forward yellow packets as best effort, and forward\n   green\
    \ packets with a low drop probability.\n"
