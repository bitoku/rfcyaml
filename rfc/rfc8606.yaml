  - "1.  Introduction\n   Section 3.4 of [RFC3326] describes a SIP message flow for
    canceling\n   an INVITE request when a REL (release) message is received from
    the\n   ISUP side.  That document specifies the SIP Reason header field\n   [RFC3326]
    that is used to indicate the reason of release.  The reason\n   of release indicates
    why a SIP Dialog or a PSTN call, in cases where\n   the call was interworked to
    the PSTN, was terminated.  The\n   termination may be normal, based on a failure
    within an entity (e.g.\n   temporary failure) or caused by other factors (e.g.,
    congestion).\n   The reason may be a SIP response or an ISUP release cause as\n
    \  specified within [Q.850].  [RFC6432] specifies that an ISUP [Q.850]\n   cause
    code can be carried within a SIP response, but not the Q.850\n   location information.
    \ The [Q.850] location information identifies\n   the part of the ISUP network
    where the call was released.\n   This document adds a location value parameter
    to the reason-extension\n   parameter defined in [RFC3326] so that the [Q.850]
    location value can\n   be interworked from the PSTN.  The interworking from the
    PSTN needs\n   only to include the location received by the interworking gateway.\n
    \  [Q.850] describes the definitions of the cause code values and the\n   locations
    used in ISDN and DSS1 (Digital Subscriber Signalling System\n   No. 1) environments.
    \ The cause code is used for identifying the\n   reason of release of a call,
    and the location identifies where the\n   call was released.\n"

    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described

  - "3.  Rationale\n   The primary intent of the parameter defined in this specification
    is\n   for use in IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) networks defined by 3GPP,\n   but
    it is also open to be used by any other networks that include\n   ISUP interworking
    gateways and use Q.850 reason codes.  The purpose\n   of this parameter is to
    hold the location of the call release so that\n   it can be transported from the
    originating PSTN entity to the SIP\n   entity via a response or BYE message.  The
    ISDN location is defined\n   in [Q.850].\n"
  title: 3.  Rationale
- contents:
  - "4.  Mechanism\n   As defined by [RFC6432], any SIP Response message, with the
    exception\n   of 100 (Trying), MAY contain a Reason header field with a Q.850\n
    \  [Q.850] cause code.\n   This specification adds a parameter with the ISUP location
    value\n   defined in [Q.850] to the Reason header field that identifies the\n
    \  location of the call release in ISUP.  The location is a 4-bit value\n   that
    reflects the possible locations where an ISUP call is released.\n   Some values
    are spare or reserved for national use.  The Augmented\n   BNF (ABNF) [RFC5234]
    for this parameter is shown in Figure 1.\n     reason-extension    =/ isup-cause-location\n

    reserved for national use\n                  Figure 1: ABNF for isup-cause-location\n
    \  Note: These are the location values defined within [Q.850].  The\n   'LOC-*'
    names are the wire codepoints for the values currently left\n   as 'spare' or
    'reserved' in [Q.850]; these will continue to be the\n   wire codepoints in the
    case of future allocation or national usage of\n   the such values.\n   The UAC
    or UAS SHALL include the location parameter in a request or\n   response when
    setting up the Reason header field with a [Q.850] cause\n   when the ISUP [Q.850]
    location is available.\n   The use of the location parameter is restricted to
    Q.850 cause\n   values.  Other values MUST be ignored if present.\n"

  - "6.  Privacy Considerations\n   While the addition of the location parameter provides
    an indicator of\n   the entity that added the location in the signaling path,
    it provides\n   little more exposure than the [Q.850] cause itself.  The ISUP\n
    \  location value itself will not reveal the identity of the originating\n   or
    terminating party of the call.  It shows only the ISUP network\n   location of
    the device that released the call.  The ISUP location\n   does not show the physical
    location of the caller or callee.\n"
  title: 6.  Privacy Considerations
- contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This document doesn't change any of the security
    considerations\n   described in [RFC3326].  The addition of the location parameter\n
    \  provides an indicator of the [Q.850] location where the call was\n   released
    within the PSTN.  This information may be used for specific\n   location-driven
    services but does not create any additional security\n   constraints.  Because
    the [Q.850] location is very imprecise, the\n   [Q.850] location value itself
    will not add any major security\n   constraints.  The use of this parameter is
    not restricted to a\n   specific architecture.\n   [RFC3398] describes detailed
    security considerations due to\n   interworking between ISUP and SIP.  Beyond
    these considerations, the\n   addition of the location does not introduce new
    security concerns.\n   The location shows the network part where the call was
    released.\n   Knowing this does not increase the possibilities of extended fraud\n
    \  scenarios.\n"
