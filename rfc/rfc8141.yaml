    \  With regard to URN\n   namespaces, this document specifies a method for defining\
    \ a URN\n   namespace and associating it with a namespace identifier, and it\n\
    \   describes procedures for registering namespace identifiers with the\n   Internet\
    \ Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  This document obsoletes\n   both RFCs 2141\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a Uniform Resource Identifier\
    \ (URI)\n   [RFC3986] that is assigned under the \"urn\" URI scheme and a\n  \
    \ particular URN namespace, with the intent that the URN will be a\n   persistent,\
    \ location-independent resource identifier.  A URN\n   namespace is a collection\
    \ of such URNs, each of which is (1) unique,\n   (2) assigned in a consistent\
    \ and managed way, and (3) assigned\n   according to a common definition.  (Some\
    \ URN namespaces create names\n   that exist only as URNs, whereas others assign\
    \ URNs based on names\n   that were already created in non-URN identifier systems,\
    \ such as\n   ISBNs [RFC3187], ISSNs [RFC3044], or RFCs [RFC2648].)\n   The assignment\
    \ of URNs is done by an organization (or, in some cases,\n   according to an algorithm\
    \ or other automated process) that has been\n   formally delegated a URN namespace\
    \ within the \"urn\" scheme (e.g., a\n   URN in the \"example\" URN namespace\
    \ [RFC6963] might be of the form\n   \"urn:example:foo\").\n   This document rests\
    \ on two key assumptions:\n   1.  Assignment of a URN is a managed process.\n\
    \   2.  The space of URN namespaces is itself managed.\n   While other URI schemes\
    \ may allow resource identifiers to be freely\n   chosen and assigned, such is\
    \ not the case for URNs.  The syntactical\n   correctness of a name starting with\
    \ \"urn:\" is not sufficient to make\n   it a URN.  In order for the name to be\
    \ a valid URN, the namespace\n   identifier (NID) needs to be registered in accordance\
    \ with the rules\n   defined here, and the remaining parts of the assigned-name\
    \ portion of\n   the URN need to be generated in accordance with the rules for\
    \ the\n   registered URN namespace.\n   So that information about both URN syntax\
    \ and URN namespaces is\n   available in one place, this document does the following:\n\
    \   1.  Defines the canonical syntax for URNs in general (in a way that\n    \
    \   is consistent with URI syntax), specifies methods for determining\n      \
    \ URN-equivalence, and discusses URI conformance.\n   2.  Specifies a method for\
    \ defining a URN namespace and associating\n       it with a particular NID, and\
    \ describes procedures for\n       registering URN NIDs with the Internet Assigned\
    \ Numbers Authority\n       (IANA).\n   For URN syntax and URN namespaces, this\
    \ document modernizes and\n   replaces the original specifications for URN syntax\
    \ [RFC2141] and for\n   the definition and registration of URN namespaces [RFC3406].\
    \  These\n   modifications build on the key requirements provided in the original\n\
    \   functional description for URNs [RFC1737] and on the lessons of many\n   years\
    \ of experience.  In those original documents and in the present\n   one, the\
    \ intent is to define URNs in a consistent manner so that,\n   wherever practical,\
    \ the parsing, handling, and resolution of URNs can\n   be independent of the\
    \ URN namespace within which a given URN is\n   assigned.\n   Together with input\
    \ from several key user communities, the history\n   and experiences with URNs\
    \ dictated expansion of the URN definition to\n   support new functionality, including\
    \ the use of syntax explicitly\n   reserved for future standardization in RFC\
    \ 2141.  All URN namespaces\n   and URNs that were valid under the earlier specifications\
    \ remain\n   valid, even though it may be useful to update the definitions of\
    \ some\n   URN namespaces to take advantage of new features.\n   The foregoing\
    \ considerations, together with various differences\n   between URNs and URIs\
    \ that are locators (specifically URLs) as well\n   as the greater focus on URLs\
    \ in RFC 3986 as the ultimate successor to\n   [RFC1738] and [RFC1808], may lead\
    \ to some interpretations of RFC 3986\n   and this specification that appear (or\
    \ perhaps actually are) not\n   completely consistent, especially with regard\
    \ to actions or semantics\n   other than the basic syntax itself.  If such situations\
    \ arise,\n   discussions of URNs and URN namespaces should be interpreted\n  \
    \ according to this document and not by extrapolation from RFC 3986.\n   Summaries\
    \ of changes from RFCs 2141 and 3406 appear in Appendices B\n   and C, respectively.\
    \  This document obsoletes both [RFC2141] and\n   [RFC3406].  While it does not\
    \ explicitly update or replace [RFC1737]\n   or [RFC2276], the reader who references\
    \ those documents should be\n   aware that the conceptual model of URNs in this\
    \ document is slightly\n   different from those older specifications.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   The following terms are distinguished from each other as\
    \ described\n   below:\n   URN:  A URI (as defined in RFC 3986) using the \"urn\"\
    \ scheme and with\n      the properties of a \"name\" as described in that document\
    \ as well\n      as the properties described in this one.  The term applies to\
    \ the\n      entire URI including its optional components.  Note to the reader:\n\
    \      the term \"URN\" has been used in other contexts to refer to a URN\n  \
    \    namespace, the namespace identifier, the assigned-name, and URIs\n      that\
    \ do not use the \"urn\" scheme.  All but the last of these is\n      described\
    \ using more specific terminology elsewhere in this\n      document, but, because\
    \ of those other uses, the term should be\n      used and interpreted with care.\n\
    \   Locator:  An identifier that provides a means of accessing a\n      resource.\n\
    \   Identifier system:  A managed collection of names.  This document\n      refers\
    \ to identifier systems outside the context of URNs as\n      \"non-URN identifier\
    \ systems\".\n   URN namespace:  An identifier system that is associated with\
    \ a URN\n      NID.\n   NID:  The identifier associated with a URN namespace.\n\
    \   NSS:  The URN-namespace-specific part of a URN.\n   Assigned-name:  The combination\
    \ of the \"urn:\" scheme, the NID, and\n      the namespace specific string (NSS).\
    \  An \"assigned-name\" is\n      consequently a substring of a URN (as defined\
    \ above) if that URN\n      contains any additional components (see Section 2).\n\
    \   The term \"name\" is deliberately not defined here and should be (and,\n \
    \  in practice, is) used only very informally.  RFC 3986 uses the term\n   as\
    \ a category of URI distinguished from \"locator\" (Section 1.1.3) but\n   also\
    \ uses it in other contexts.  If those uses are treated as\n   definitional, they\
    \ would conflict with, e.g., the idea of URN\n   namespace names (i.e., NIDs)\
    \ and with terms associated with non-URN\n   identifier systems.\n   This document\
    \ uses the terms \"resource\", \"identifier\", \"identify\",\n   \"dereference\"\
    , \"representation\", and \"metadata\" roughly as defined in\n   the URI specification\
    \ [RFC3986].\n   This document uses the terms \"resolution\" and \"resolver\"\
    \ in roughly\n   the sense in which they were used in the original discussion\
    \ of\n   architectural principles for URNs [RFC2276], i.e., \"resolution\" is\n\
    \   the act of supplying services related to the identified resource,\n   such\
    \ as translating the persistent URN into one or more current\n   locators for\
    \ the resource, delivering metadata about the resource in\n   an appropriate format,\
    \ or even delivering a representation of the\n   resource (e.g., a document) without\
    \ requiring further intermediaries.\n   At the time of this writing, resolution\
    \ services are described in\n   [RFC2483].\n   On the distinction between representations\
    \ and metadata, see\n   Section 1.2.2 of [RFC3986].\n   Several other terms related\
    \ to \"normalization\" operations that are\n   not part of the Unicode Standard\
    \ [UNICODE] are also used here as they\n   are in RFC 3986.\n   The key words\
    \ \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\"\
    , \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\"\
    \ in this document are to be interpreted as described in\n   [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 1.2.  Design Trade-offs
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Design Trade-offs\n   To a degree much greater than when URNs were first\
    \ considered and\n   their uses outlined (see [RFC1737]), issues of persistent\
    \ identifiers\n   on the Internet involve fundamental design trade-offs that are\
    \ much\n   broader than URNs or the URN approach and even touch on open research\n\
    \   questions within the information sciences community.  Ideal and\n   comprehensive\
    \ specifications about what should be done or required\n   across the entire universe\
    \ of URNs would require general agreement\n   about, and solutions to, a wide\
    \ range of such issues.  Although some\n   of those issues were introduced by\
    \ the Internet or computer-age\n   approaches to character encodings and data\
    \ abstraction, others\n   predate the Internet and computer systems by centuries;\
    \ there is\n   unlikely to be agreement about comprehensive solutions in the near\n\
    \   future.\n   Although this specification consequently contains some requirements\n\
    \   and flexibility that would not be present in a more perfect world,\n   this\
    \ has been necessary in order to produce a consensus specification\n   that provides\
    \ a modernized definition of URNs (the unattractive\n   alternative would have\
    \ been to not modernize the definition in spite\n   of widespread deployment).\n\
    \   The following sub-sections describe two of the relevant issues in\n   greater\
    \ detail.\n"
- title: 1.2.1.  Resolution
  contents:
  - "1.2.1.  Resolution\n   One issue that is specific to URNs (as opposed to naming\
    \ systems in\n   general) is the fairly difficult topic of \"resolution\", discussed\
    \ in\n   Sections 1.1, 2.3.1, 6.4.6, and elsewhere below.\n   With traditional\
    \ Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), i.e., with most\n   URIs that are locators,\
    \ resolution is relatively straightforward\n   because it is used to determine\
    \ an access mechanism that in turn is\n   used to dereference the locator by (typically)\
    \ retrieving a\n   representation of the associated resource, such as a document\
    \ (see\n   Section 1.2.2 of [RFC3986]).\n   By contrast, resolution for URNs is\
    \ more flexible and varied.\n   One important case involves the mapping of a URN\
    \ to one or more\n   locators.  In this case, the end result is still a matter\
    \ of\n   dereferencing the mapped locator(s) to one or more representations.\n\
    \   The primary difference here is persistence: even if a mapped locator\n   has\
    \ changed (e.g., a DNS domain name has changed hands and a URL has\n   not been\
    \ modified to point to a new location or, in a more extreme\n   and hypothetical\
    \ case, the DNS is replaced entirely), a URN user will\n   be able to obtain the\
    \ correct representation (e.g., a document) as\n   long as the resolver has kept\
    \ its URN-to-locator mappings up to date.\n   Consequently, the relevant relationships\
    \ can be defined quite\n   precisely for URNs that resolve to locators that in\
    \ turn are\n   dereferenced to a representation.\n   However, this specification\
    \ permits several other cases of URN\n   resolution as well as URNs for resources\
    \ that do not involve\n   information retrieval systems.  This is true either\
    \ individually for\n   particular URNs or (as defined below) collectively for\
    \ entire URN\n   namespaces.\n   Consider a namespace of URNs that resolve to\
    \ locators that in turn\n   are dereferenced only to metadata about resources\
    \ because the\n   underlying systems contain no representations of those resources;\
    \ an\n   example might be a URN namespace for International Standard Name\n  \
    \ Identifiers (ISNIs) as that identifier system is defined in the\n   relevant\
    \ standard [ISO.27729.2012], wherein by default a URN would be\n   resolved only\
    \ to a metadata record describing the public identity\n   identified by the ISNI.\n\
    \   Consider also URNs that resolve to representations only if the\n   requesting\
    \ entity is authorized to obtain the representation, whereas\n   other entities\
    \ can obtain only metadata about the resource; an\n   example might be documents\
    \ held within the legal depository\n   collection of a national library.\n   Finally,\
    \ some URNs might not be intended to resolve to locators at\n   all; examples\
    \ might include URNs identifying XML namespace names\n   (e.g., the \"dgiwg\"\
    \ URN namespace specified by [RFC6288]), URNs\n   identifying application features\
    \ that can be supported within a\n   communications protocol (e.g., the \"alert\"\
    \ URN namespace specified by\n   [RFC7462]), and URNs identifying enumerated types\
    \ such as values in a\n   registry (e.g., a URN namespace could be used to individually\n\
    \   identify the values in all IANA registries, as provisionally proposed\n  \
    \ in [IANA-URN]).\n   Various types of URNs and multiple resolution services that\
    \ may be\n   available for them leave the concept of \"resolution\" more complicated\n\
    \   but also much richer for URNs than the straightforward case of\n   resolution\
    \ to a locator that is dereferenced to a representation.\n"
- title: 1.2.2.  Character Sets and Encodings
  contents:
  - "1.2.2.  Character Sets and Encodings\n   A similar set of considerations apply\
    \ to character sets and\n   encodings.  URNs, especially URNs that will be used\
    \ as user-facing\n   identifiers, should be convenient to use in local languages\
    \ and\n   writing systems, easily specified with a wide range of keyboards and\n\
    \   local conventions, and unambiguous.  There are trade-offs among those\n  \
    \ goals, and it is impossible at present to see how a simple and\n   readily understandable\
    \ set of rules could be developed that would be\n   optimal, or even reasonable,\
    \ for all URNs.  The discussion in\n   Section 2.2 defines an overall framework\
    \ that should make generalized\n   parsing and processing possible but also makes\
    \ recommendations about\n   rules for individual URN namespaces.\n"
- title: 2.  URN Syntax
  contents:
  - "2.  URN Syntax\n   As discussed above, the syntax for URNs in this specification\
    \ allows\n   significantly more functionality than was the case in the earlier\n\

- title: 2.2.  Namespace Specific String (NSS)
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Namespace Specific String (NSS)\n   The NSS is a string, unique within\
    \ a URN namespace, that is assigned\n   and managed in a consistent way and that\
    \ conforms to the definition\n   of the relevant URN namespace.  The combination\
    \ of the NID (unique\n   across the entire \"urn\" scheme) and the NSS (unique\
    \ within the URN\n   namespace) ensures that the resulting URN is globally unique.\n\
    \   The NSS as specified in this document allows several characters not\n   permitted\
    \ by earlier specifications (see Appendix B).  In particular,\n   the \"/\" character,\
    \ which is now allowed, effectively makes it\n   possible to encapsulate hierarchical\
    \ names from non-URN identifier\n   systems.  For instance, consider the hypothetical\
    \ example of a\n   hierarchical identifier system in which the names take the\
    \ form of a\n   sequence of numbers separated by the \"/\" character, such as\n\
    \   \"1/406/47452/2\".  If the authority for such names were to use URNs,\n  \
    \ it would be natural to place the existing name in the NSS, resulting\n   in\
    \ URNs such as \"urn:example:1/406/47452/2\".\n   Those changes to the syntax\
    \ for the NSS do not modify the encoding\n   rules for URN namespaces that were\
    \ defined in accordance with\n   [RFC2141].  If any such URN namespace whose names\
    \ are used outside of\n   the URN context (i.e., in a non-URN identifier system)\
    \ also allows\n   the use of \"/\", \"~\", or \"&\" in the native form within\
    \ that identifier\n   system, then the encoding rules for that URN namespace are\
    \ not\n   changed by this specification.\n   Depending on the rules governing\
    \ a non-URN identifier system and its\n   associated URN namespace, names that\
    \ are valid in that identifier\n   system might contain characters that are not\
    \ allowed by the \"pchar\"\n   production referenced above (e.g., characters outside\
    \ the ASCII range\n   or, consistent with the restrictions in RFC 3986, the characters\
    \ \"/\",\n   \"?\", \"#\", \"[\", and \"]\").  While such a name might be valid\
    \ within the\n   non-URN identifier system, it is not a valid URN until it has\
    \ been\n   translated into an NSS that conforms to the rules of that particular\n\
    \   URN namespace.  In the case of URNs that are formed from names that\n   exist\
    \ separately in a non-URN identifier system, translation of a\n   name from its\
    \ \"native\" format to a URN format is accomplished by\n   using the canonicalization\
    \ and encoding methods defined for URNs in\n   general or specific rules for that\
    \ URN namespace.  Software that is\n   not aware of namespace-specific canonicalization\
    \ and encoding rules\n   MUST NOT construct URNs from the name in the non-URN\
    \ identifier\n   system.\n   In particular, with regard to characters outside\
    \ the ASCII range,\n   URNs that appear in protocols or that are passed between\
    \ systems MUST\n   use only Unicode characters encoded in UTF-8 and further encoded\
    \ as\n   required by RFC 3986.  To the extent feasible and consistent with the\n\
    \   requirements of names defined and standardized elsewhere, as well as\n   the\
    \ principles discussed in Section 1.2, the characters used to\n   represent names\
    \ SHOULD be restricted to either ASCII letters and\n   digits or to the characters\
    \ and syntax of some widely used models\n   such as those of Internationalizing\
    \ Domain Names in Applications\n   (IDNA) [RFC5890], Preparation, Enforcement,\
    \ and Comparison of\n   Internationalized Strings (PRECIS) [RFC7613], or the Unicode\n\
    \   Identifier and Pattern Syntax specification [UAX31].\n   In order to make\
    \ URNs as stable and persistent as possible when\n   protocols evolve and the\
    \ environment around them changes, URN\n   namespaces SHOULD NOT allow characters\
    \ outside the ASCII range\n   [RFC20] unless the nature of the particular URN\
    \ namespace makes such\n   characters necessary.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Optional Components
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Optional Components\n   This specification includes three optional components\
    \ in the URN\n   syntax.  They are known as r-component, q-component, and f-component\n\
    \   and are described in more detail below.  Because this specification\n   focuses\
    \ almost exclusively on URN syntax, it does not define detailed\n   semantics\
    \ of these components for URNs in general.  However, each of\n   these components\
    \ has a distinct role that is independent of any given\n   URN and its URN namespace.\
    \  It is intended that clients will be able\n   to handle these components uniformly\
    \ for all URNs.  These components\n   MAY be used with URNs from existing URN\
    \ namespaces, whether or not a\n   URN namespace explicitly supports them.  However,\
    \ consistent with the\n   approach taken in RFC 3986, the behavior of a URN that\
    \ contains\n   components that are undefined or meaningless for a particular URN\n\

    \   identified by a URN, or to applications that manage such resources,\n   is\

    \ has no syntactic counterpart in any other known\n   URI scheme.\n   The sequence\

    \ (which begins a q-component) or a \"#\" character\n   (number sign, which begins\
    \ an f-component).  If neither of those\n   appear, the r-component continues\
    \ to the end of the URN.  Note that\n   characters outside the ASCII range [RFC20]\

    \ the r-component and its\n   use in URN resolution protocols are a matter for\
    \ potential\n   standardization in separate specifications, presumably including\n\
    \   specifications that define conventions and a registry for resolution\n   service\
    \ identifiers.\n   Consider the hypothetical example of passing parameters to\
    \ a\n   resolution service (say, an ISO alpha-2 country code [ISO.3166-1] in\n\

    \   While the above should serve as a general explanation and\n   illustration\

    \ their relationship to resolution\n   mechanisms associated with the particular\

    \ for URNs\n   before their semantics have been standardized.\n"
- title: 2.3.2.  q-component
  contents:
  - "2.3.2.  q-component\n   The q-component is intended for passing parameters to\

    \ in the previous section.)\n   The URN q-component has the same syntax as the\
    \ URI query component\n   but is introduced by \"?=\", not \"?\" alone.  For a\
    \ URN that may be\n   resolved to a URI that is a locator, the semantics of the\

    \  Thus,\n   URN resolvers returning a URI that is a locator for a URN with a\n\
    \   q-component do this by copying the q-component from the URN to the\n   query\
    \ component of the URI.  An example of the copying operation\n   appears below.\n\
    \   This specification does not specify a required behavior in the case\n   of\
    \ URN resolution to a URI that is a locator when the original URN\n   has a q-component\

    \ are identical to those for queries to\n   the resource located via that URI.\n\
    \   For the sake of consistency with RFC 3986, the general syntax and the\n  \

    \ a resolution service to consider\n   the q-component.  Namespace-specific and\

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Procedure\n   For various purposes such as caching, it is often desirable\
    \ to\n   determine if two URNs are \"the same\".  This is done most generally\n\
    \   (i.e., independent of the scheme) by testing for equivalence (see\n   Section\
    \ 6.1 of [RFC3986]).\n   The generic URI specification [RFC3986] is very flexible\
    \ about\n   equality comparisons, putting the focus on allowing false negatives\n\
    \   and avoiding false positives.  If comparisons are made in a scheme-\n   independent\
    \ way, i.e., as URI comparisons only, many URNs that this\n   specification considers\
    \ equal would be rejected.  The discussion\n   below applies when the URIs involved\
    \ are known to be URNs and thus\n   uses the terms \"URN-equivalent\" and \"URN-equivalence\"\
    \ to refer to\n   equivalence as specified in this document.\n   Two URNs are\
    \ URN-equivalent if their assigned-name portions are\n   octet-by-octet equal\
    \ after applying case normalization (as specified\n   in Section 6.2.2.1 of [RFC3986])\
    \ to the following constructs:\n   1.  the URI scheme \"urn\", by conversion to\
    \ lower case\n   2.  the NID, by conversion to lower case\n   3.  any percent-encoded\
    \ characters in the NSS (that is, all character\n       triplets that match the\
    \ <pct-encoding> production found in\n       Section 2.1 of the base URI specification\
    \ [RFC3986]), by\n       conversion to upper case for the digits A-F.\n   Percent-encoded\
    \ characters MUST NOT be decoded, i.e., percent-\n   encoding normalization (as\
    \ specified in Section 6.2.2.2 of [RFC3986])\n   MUST NOT be applied as part of\
    \ the comparison process.\n   If an r-component, q-component, or f-component (or\
    \ any combination\n   thereof) is included in a URN, it MUST be ignored for purposes\
    \ of\n   determining URN-equivalence.\n   URN namespace definitions MAY include\
    \ additional rules for\n   URN-equivalence, such as case insensitivity of the\
    \ NSS (or parts\n   thereof).  Such rules MUST always have the effect of eliminating\
    \ some\n   of the false negatives obtained by the procedure above and MUST NOT\n\
    \   result in treating two URNs as not \"the same\" if the procedure here\n  \
    \ says they are URN-equivalent.  For related considerations with regard\n   to\
    \ NID registration, see below.\n"

    \ URNs are URN-equivalent to each other:\n   o  urn:example:a123,z456\n   o  URN:example:a123,z456\n\
    \   o  urn:EXAMPLE:a123,z456\n   Second, because the r-component, q-component,\
    \ and f-component are not\n   taken into account for purposes of testing URN-equivalence,\
    \ the\n   following three URNs are URN-equivalent to the first three examples\n\

    \   o  urn:example:a123,z456#789\n   Third, because the \"/\" character (and anything\
    \ that follows it) in\n   the NSS is taken into account for purposes of URN-equivalence,\
    \ the\n   following URNs are not URN-equivalent to each other or to the six\n\
    \   preceding URNs:\n   o  urn:example:a123,z456/foo\n   o  urn:example:a123,z456/bar\n\
    \   o  urn:example:a123,z456/baz\n   Fourth, because of percent-encoding, the\
    \ following URNs are\n   URN-equivalent only to each other and not to any of those\
    \ above (note\n   that, although %2C is the percent-encoded transformation of\
    \ \",\" from\n   the previous examples, such sequences are not decoded for purposes\
    \ of\n   testing URN-equivalence):\n   o  urn:example:a123%2Cz456\n   o  URN:EXAMPLE:a123%2cz456\n\
    \   Fifth, because characters in the NSS other than percent-encoded\n   sequences\
    \ are treated in a case-sensitive manner (unless otherwise\n   specified for the\
    \ URN namespace in question), the following URNs are\n   not URN-equivalent to\
    \ the first three URNs:\n   o  urn:example:A123,z456\n   o  urn:example:a123,Z456\n\
    \   Sixth, on casual visual inspection of a URN presented in a human-\n   oriented\

    \ (because U+0430 CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER A can be\n   confused with U+0061 LATIN\
    \ SMALL LETTER A), but it is not\n   URN-equivalent to the first three URNs:\n\

  - "4.2.  Parsing\n   In part because of the separation of URN semantics from more\
    \ general\n   URI syntax, generic URI processors need to pay special attention\
    \ to\n   the parsing and analysis rules of RFC 3986 and, in particular, must\n\
    \   treat the URI as opaque unless the scheme and its requirements are\n   recognized.\
    \  In the latter case, such processors may be in a position\n   to invoke scheme-appropriate\
    \ processing, e.g., by a URN resolver.  A\n   URN resolver can either be an external\
    \ resolver that the URI resolver\n   knows of or be functionality built into the\
    \ URI resolver.  Note that\n   this requirement might impose constraints on the\
    \ contexts in which\n   URNs are appropriately used; see Section 4.1.\n"
- title: 4.3.  URNs and Relative References
  contents:
  - "4.3.  URNs and Relative References\n   Section 5.2 of [RFC3986] describes an\
    \ algorithm for converting a URI\n   reference that might be relative to a given\
    \ base URI into \"parsed\n   components\" of the target of that reference, which\
    \ can then be\n   recomposed per RFC 3986, Section 5.3 into a target URI.  This\n\
    \   algorithm is problematic for URNs because their syntax does not\n   support\
    \ the necessary path components.  However, if the algorithm is\n   applied independent\
    \ of a particular scheme, it should work\n   predictably for URNs as well, with\
    \ the following understandings\n   (syntax production terminology taken from RFC\
    \ 3986):\n   1.  A system that encounters a <URI-reference> that obeys the syntax\n\
    \       for <relative-ref>, whether it explicitly has the scheme \"urn\" or\n\
    \       not, will convert it into a target URI as specified in RFC 3986.\n   2.\
    \  Because of the persistence and stability expectations of URNs,\n       authors\
    \ of documents, etc., that utilize URNs should generally\n       avoid the use\
    \ of the \"urn\" scheme in any <URI-reference> that is\n       not strictly a\
    \ <URI> as specified in RFC 3986, specifically\n       including those that would\
    \ require processing of <relative-ref>.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.4.  Transport and Display\n   When URNs are transported and exchanged, they\
    \ MUST be represented in\n   the format defined herein.  Further, URN-aware applications\
    \ are\n   strongly encouraged to offer the option of displaying URNs in this\n\
    \   canonical form to allow for direct transcription (for example by\n   copy-and-paste\
    \ techniques).  Such applications might support the\n   display of URNs in a more\
    \ human-friendly form and might use a\n   character set that includes characters\
    \ that are not permitted in URN\n   syntax as defined in this specification (e.g.,\
    \ when displaying URNs\n   to humans, such applications might replace percent-encoded\
    \ strings\n   with characters from an extended character repertoire such as Unicode\n\
    \   [UNICODE]).\n   To minimize user confusion, any application displaying URIs\
    \ SHOULD\n   display the complete URI (including, for URNs, the \"urn\" scheme\
    \ and\n   any components) to ensure that there is no confusion between URN NIDs\n\
    \   and URI scheme identifiers.  For example, a URI beginning with\n   \"urn:xmpp:\"\
    \ [RFC4854] is very different from a URI beginning with\n   \"xmpp:\" [RFC5122].\
    \  Similarly, a potential Digital Object Identifier\n   (DOI) URI scheme [DOI-URI]\
    \ is different from, and possibly completely\n   unrelated to, a possible DOI\
    \ URN namespace.\n"

- title: 5.  URN Namespaces
  contents:
  - "5.  URN Namespaces\n   A URN namespace is a collection of names that obey three\
    \ constraints:\n   each name is (1) unique, (2) assigned in a consistent way,\
    \ and (3)\n   assigned according to a common definition.\n   1.  The \"uniqueness\"\
    \ constraint means that a name within the URN\n       namespace is never assigned\
    \ to more than one resource and never\n       reassigned to a different resource\
    \ (for the kind of \"resource\"\n       identified by URNs assigned within the\
    \ URN namespace).  This\n       holds true even if the name itself is deprecated\
    \ or becomes\n       obsolete.\n   2.  The \"consistent assignment\" constraint\
    \ means that a name within\n       the URN namespace is assigned by an organization\
    \ or created in\n       accordance with a process or algorithm that is always\
    \ followed.\n   3.  The \"common definition\" constraint means that there are\
    \ clear\n       definitions for the syntax of names within the URN namespace and\n\
    \       for the process of assigning or creating them.\n   A URN namespace is\
    \ identified by a particular NID in order to ensure\n   the global uniqueness\
    \ of URNs and, optionally, to provide a cue\n   regarding the structure of URNs\
    \ assigned within a URN namespace.\n   With regard to global uniqueness, using\
    \ different NIDs for different\n   collections of names ensures that no two URNs\
    \ will be the same for\n   different resources, because each collection is required\
    \ to uniquely\n   assign each name.  However, a single resource MAY have more\
    \ than one\n   URN assigned to it, either in the same URN namespace (if the URN\n\
    \   namespace permits it) or in different URN namespaces, and for either\n   similar\
    \ purposes or different purposes.  (For example, if a publisher\n   assigns an\
    \ ISBN [RFC3187] to an electronic publication and that\n   publication is later\
    \ incorporated into a digital long-term archive\n   operated by a national library,\
    \ the library might assign the\n   publication a national bibliography number\
    \ (NBN) [RFC3188], resulting\n   in two URNs referring to the same book.)  Subject\
    \ to other\n   constraints, such as those imposed by the URI syntax [RFC3986],\
    \ the\n   rules of the URN scheme are intended to allow preserving the normal\n\
    \   and natural form of names specified in non-URN identifier systems\n   when\
    \ they are treated as URNs.\n   With regard to the structure of names assigned\
    \ within a URN\n   namespace, the development of a naming structure (and thereby\
    \ a\n   collection of names) depends on the requirements of the community\n  \
    \ defining the names, how the names will be assigned and used, etc.\n   These\
    \ issues are beyond the scope of URN syntax and the general rules\n   for URN\
    \ namespaces, because they are specific to the community\n   defining a non-URN\
    \ identifier system or a particular URN namespace\n   (e.g., the bibliographic\
    \ and publishing communities in the case of\n   the \"ISBN\" URN namespace [RFC3187]\
    \ and the \"ISSN\" URN namespace\n   [RFC3044] or the developers of extensions\
    \ to the Extensible Messaging\n   and Presence Protocol [RFC6120] in the case\
    \ of the \"XMPP\" URN\n   namespace [RFC4854]).\n   Because the colon character\
    \ (\":\") is used to separate \"urn\" from the\n   NID and the NID from the NSS,\
    \ it's tempting to think of the entire\n   URN as being structured by colon characters\
    \ and to assume that colons\n   create a structure or hierarchy within the NSS\
    \ portion of the URN.\n   Such structure could be specified by a particular NID\
    \ specification,\n   but there is no implicit structure.  In a URN such as\n \
    \     urn:example:apple:pear:plum:cherry\n   the NSS string is \"apple:pear:plum:cherry\"\
    \ as a whole, and there is\n   no specific meaning to the colon characters within\
    \ that NSS string\n   unless such meaning is described in the specification of\
    \ the\n   \"example\" namespace.\n   URN namespaces inherit certain rights and\
    \ responsibilities by the\n   nature of URNs, in particular:\n   1.  They uphold\
    \ the general principles of a well-managed URN\n       namespace by providing\
    \ persistent identification of resources and\n       unique assignment of names\
    \ in accordance with a common\n       definition.\n   2.  Optionally, they can\
    \ be registered in global registration\n       services such as those described\
    \ in [RFC2483].\n   There are two types of URN namespaces: formal and informal.\
    \  These\n   are distinguished by the expected level of service, the information\n\
    \   needed to define the URN namespace, and the procedures for\n   registration.\
    \  Because the majority of the URN namespaces registered\n   so far have been\
    \ formal, this document concentrates on formal URN\n   namespaces.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Formal URN Namespaces
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Formal URN Namespaces\n   A formal URN namespace provides benefit to some\
    \ subset of users on\n   the Internet.  In particular, it would not make sense\
    \ for a formal\n   URN namespace to be used only by a community or network that\
    \ is not\n   connected to the Internet.  For example, it would be inappropriate\n\
    \   for a URN namespace to effectively force someone to use a proprietary\n  \
    \ network or service not open to the general Internet user.  The intent\n   is\
    \ that, while the community of those who might actively use the URNs\n   assigned\
    \ within that URN namespace might be small, the potential use\n   of names within\
    \ that URN namespace is open to any user on the\n   Internet.  Formal URN namespaces\
    \ might be appropriate even when some\n   aspects are not fully open.  For example,\
    \ a URN namespace might make\n   use of a fee-based, privately managed, or proprietary\
    \ registry for\n   assignment of URNs in the URN namespace.  However, it might\
    \ still\n   benefit some Internet users if the associated services have openly\n\
    \   published names.\n   An organization that will assign URNs within a formal\
    \ URN namespace\n   SHOULD meet the following criteria:\n   1.  Organizational\
    \ stability and the ability to maintain the URN\n       namespace for a long time;\
    \ absent such evidence, it ought to be\n       clear how the URN namespace can\
    \ remain viable if the organization\n       can no longer maintain the URN namespace.\n\
    \   2.  Competency in URN assignment.  This will improve the likelihood\n    \
    \   of persistence (e.g., to minimize the likelihood of conflicts).\n   3.  Commitment\
    \ to not reassigning existing URNs and to allowing old\n       URNs to continue\
    \ to be valid (e.g., if the assignee of a URN is\n       no longer a member or\
    \ customer of the assigning organization, if\n       various information about\
    \ the assignee or named entity happens to\n       change, or even if the assignee\
    \ or the named entity itself is no\n       longer in existence; in all these cases,\
    \ the URN is still valid).\n   A formal URN namespace establishes a particular\
    \ NID, subject to the\n   following constraints (above and beyond the syntax rules\
    \ already\n   specified):\n   1.  It MUST NOT be an already-registered NID.\n\
    \   2.  It MUST NOT start with \"urn-\" (which is reserved for informal URN\n\
    \       namespaces).\n   3.  It MUST be more than two characters long, and it\
    \ MUST NOT start\n       with ALPHA ALPHA \"-\", i.e., any string consisting of\
    \ two letters\n       followed by one hyphen; such strings are reserved for potential\n\
    \       use as NIDs based on ISO alpha-2 country codes [ISO.3166-1] for\n    \
    \   eventual national registrations of URN namespaces (however, the\n       definition\
    \ and scoping of rules for allocation of responsibility\n       for such country-code-based\
    \ URN namespaces are beyond the scope\n       of this document).  As a consequence,\
    \ it MUST NOT start with the\n       string \"xn--\" or any other string consisting\
    \ of two letters\n       followed by two hyphens; such strings are reserved for\
    \ potential\n       representation of DNS A-labels and similar strings in the\
    \ future\n       [RFC5890].\n   4.  It MUST NOT start with the string \"X-\" so\
    \ that it will not be\n       confused with or conflict with any experimental\
    \ URN namespace\n       previously permitted by [RFC3406].\n   Applicants and\
    \ reviewers considering new NIDs should also be aware\n   that they may have semantic\
    \ implications and hence be a source of\n   conflict.  Particular attention should\
    \ be paid to strings that might\n   be construed as identifiers for, or registered\
    \ under the authority\n   of, countries (including ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes) and\
    \ to strings\n   that might imply association with existing URI schemes, non-URN\n\
    \   identifier systems, or trademarks.  However, in line with traditional\n  \
    \ policies, disputes about \"ownership\" of particular strings are\n   disagreements\
    \ among the parties involved; neither IANA nor the IETF\n   will become involved\

- title: '6.2.  Registration Policy and Process: Community Registrations'
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Registration Policy and Process: Community Registrations\n   The basic\
    \ registration policy for URN namespaces is Expert Review as\n   defined in the\
    \ IANA Considerations document [RFC5226].  For URN\n   namespaces or their definitions\
    \ that are intended to become standards\n   or constituent parts of standards,\
    \ the output of the Expert Review\n   process is intended to be a report rather\
    \ than instructions to IANA\n   to take action (see below).  The key steps are:\n\
    \   1.  Fill out the URN namespace registration template (see Section 6.4\n  \
    \     and Appendix A).  This can be done as part of an Internet-Draft\n      \
    \ or a specification in another series, although that is not a\n       requirement.\n\
    \   2.  Send the completed template to the urn@ietf.org discussion list\n    \
    \   for review.\n   3.  If necessary to address comments received, repeat steps\
    \ 1 and 2.\n   4.  If the Designated Experts approve the request and no\n    \
    \   standardization action is involved, the IANA will register the\n       requested\
    \ NID.  If standardization is anticipated, the Designated\n       Experts will\
    \ prepare a report and forward it to the appropriate\n       standards approval\
    \ body (the IESG in the case of the IETF); IANA\n       will register the requested\
    \ NID only after receiving directions\n       from that body and a copy of the\
    \ Expert Review report.\n   A URN namespace registration can be revised by updating\
    \ the\n   registration template, following the same steps outlined above for\n\
    \   new registrations.  A revised registration MUST describe differences\n   from\
    \ prior versions and SHOULD make special note of any relevant\n   changes in the\
    \ underlying technologies or URN namespace management\n   processes.\n   Experience\
    \ to date with URN namespace registration requests has shown\n   that registrants\
    \ sometimes do not initially understand some of the\n   subtleties of URN namespaces\
    \ and that defining the URN namespace in\n   the form of a specification enables\
    \ the registrants to clearly\n   formulate their \"contract\" with the intended\
    \ user community.\n   Therefore, although the registration policy for formal URN\
    \ namespaces\n   is Expert Review and a specification (as distinct from the\n\
    \   registration template) is not strictly required, registrants SHOULD\n   provide\
    \ a stable specification documenting the URN namespace\n   definition and expanding\
    \ upon the issues described herein.\n   Because naming can be difficult and contentious,\
    \ URN namespace\n   registrants and the Designated Experts are strongly encouraged\
    \ to\n   work together in a spirit of good faith and mutual understanding to\n\
    \   achieve rough consensus (see [RFC7282]) on handling registration\n   requests.\
    \  They are also encouraged to bring additional expertise\n   into the discussion\
    \ if that would be helpful in providing perspective\n   or otherwise resolving\
    \ issues.\n   Especially when iterations in the registration process are prolonged,\n\
    \   Designated Experts are expected to take reasonable precautions to\n   avoid\

    \ description of the structure of URNs within the URN namespace,\n       in conformance\
    \ with the fundamental URN syntax.  The structure\n       might be described in\
    \ terms of a formal definition (e.g., using\n       ABNF [RFC5234]), an algorithm\
    \ for generating conformant URNs, or\n       a regular expression for parsing\
    \ the name into constituent parts;\n       alternatively, the structure might\
    \ be opaque.\n   2.  Any special character encoding rules for assigned URNs (e.g.,\n\
    \       which character ought to always be used for quotes).\n   3.  Rules for\
    \ determining URN-equivalence between two names in the\n       URN namespace.\
    \  Such rules ought to always have the effect of\n       eliminating false negatives\
    \ that might otherwise result from\n       comparison.  If it is appropriate and\
    \ helpful, reference can be\n       made to particular equivalence rules defined\
    \ in the URI\n       specification [RFC3986] or to Section 3 of this document.\n\
    \       Examples of URN-equivalence rules include equivalence between\n      \
    \ uppercase and lowercase characters in the NSS, between hyphenated\n       and\
    \ non-hyphenated groupings in the name, or between single\n       quotes and double\
    \ quotes.  There may also be namespace-specific\n       special encoding considerations,\
    \ especially for URNs that contain\n       embedded forms of names from non-URN\
    \ identifier systems.  (Note\n       that these are not normative statements for\
    \ any kind of best\n       practice related to handling of relationships between\
    \ characters\n       in general; such statements are limited to one particular\
    \ URN\n       namespace only.)\n   4.  Any special considerations necessary for\
    \ conforming with the URN\n       syntax.  This is particularly applicable in\
    \ the case of existing,\n       non-URN identifier systems that are used in the\
    \ context of URNs.\n       For example, if a non-URN identifier system is used\
    \ in contexts\n       other than URNs, it might make use of characters that are\n\
    \       reserved in the URN syntax.  This section ought to note any such\n   \
    \    characters and outline necessary mappings to conform to URN\n       syntax.\
    \  Normally, this will be handled by percent-encoding the\n       character as\
    \ specified in Section 2.1 of the URI specification\n       [RFC3986] and as discussed\
    \ in Section 1.2.2 of this\n       specification.\n   5.  Any special considerations\
    \ for the meaning of q-components (e.g.,\n       keywords) or f-components (e.g.,\
    \ predefined terms) in the context\n       of this URN namespace.\n"
- title: 6.4.3.  Assignment
  contents:
  - "6.4.3.  Assignment\n   The \"Assignment\" section of the template describes matters\
    \ such as:\n   1.  Mechanisms or authorities for assigning URNs to resources.\
    \  It\n       ought to make clear whether assignment is completely open (e.g.,\n\
    \       following a particular procedure such as first-come, first-served\n  \
    \     (FCFS)), completely closed (e.g., for a private organization), or\n    \
    \   limited in various ways (e.g., delegated to authorities\n       recognized\
    \ by a particular organization); if limited, it ought to\n       explain how to\
    \ become an assigner of names or how to request\n       assignment of names from\
    \ existing assignment authorities.\n   2.  Methods for ensuring that URNs within\
    \ the URN namespace are\n       unique.  For example, names might be assigned\
    \ sequentially or in\n       accordance with some well-defined process by a single\
    \ authority,\n       assignment might be partitioned among delegated authorities\
    \ that\n       are individually responsible for respecting uniqueness rules, or\n\
    \       URNs might be created independently following an algorithm that\n    \
    \   itself guarantees uniqueness.\n"
- title: 6.4.4.  Security and Privacy
  contents:
  - "6.4.4.  Security and Privacy\n   The \"Security and Privacy\" section of the\
    \ template describes any\n   potential issues related to security and privacy\
    \ with regard to\n   assignment, use, and resolution of names within the URN namespace.\n\
    \   Examples of such issues include:\n   o  The consequences of producing false\
    \ negatives and false positives\n      during comparison for URN-equivalence (see\
    \ Section 3.1 of this\n      specification and \"Issues in Identifier Comparison\
    \ for Security\n      Purposes\" [RFC6943]).\n   o  Leakage of private information\
    \ when names are communicated on the\n      public Internet.\n   o  The potential\
    \ for directory harvesting.\n   o  Various issues discussed in the guidelines\
    \ for security\n      considerations in RFCs [RFC3552] and the privacy considerations\n\
    \      for Internet protocols [RFC6973].  In particular, note the privacy\n  \
    \    considerations text for the Global System for Mobile\n      Communications\
    \ Association (GSMA) / International Mobile station\n      Equipment Identity\

    \ cases.\n"
- title: 6.4.5.  Interoperability
  contents:
  - "6.4.5.  Interoperability\n   The \"Interoperability\" section MUST specify any\
    \ known potential\n   issues related to interoperability.  Examples include possible\n\
    \   confusion with other URN namespaces, non-URN identifier systems, or\n   URI\
    \ schemes because of syntax (e.g., percent-encoding of certain\n   characters)\
    \ or scope (e.g., overlapping areas of interest).  If at\n   all possible, concerns\
    \ that arise during the registration of a URN\n   namespace (e.g., due to the\
    \ syntax or scope of a non-URN identifier\n   system) should be resolved as part\
    \ of or in parallel to the\n   registration process.\n"
- title: 6.4.6.  Resolution
  contents:
  - "6.4.6.  Resolution\n   The \"Resolution\" section MUST specify whether resolution\
    \ mechanisms\n   are intended or anticipated for URNs assigned within the URN\n\
    \   namespace.\n   If resolution is intended, then this section SHOULD specify\
    \ whether\n   the organization that assigns URNs within the URN namespace intends\n\
    \   to operate or recommend any resolution services for URNs within that\n   URN\
    \ namespace.  In addition, if the assigning organization intends to\n   implement\
    \ registration for publicly advertised resolution services\n   (for example, using\
    \ a system developed in the spirit of the original\n   architectural principles\
    \ and service descriptions for URN resolution\n   [RFC2276] [RFC2483]), then this\
    \ section SHOULD list or reference the\n   requirements for being publicly advertised\
    \ by the assigning\n   organization.  In addition, this section SHOULD describe\
    \ any special\n   considerations for the handling of r-components in the context\
    \ of\n   this URN namespace.\n"

  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Registration Template\n   Namespace Identifier:  Requested of IANA\
    \ (formal) or assigned by IANA\n      (informal).\n   Version:  The version of\
    \ the registration, starting with 1 and\n      incrementing by 1 with each new\
    \ version.\n   Date:  The date when the registration is requested of IANA, using\
    \ the\n      format YYYY-MM-DD.\n   Registrant:  The person or organization that\
    \ has registered the NID,\n      including the name and address of the registering\
    \ organization, as\n      well as the name and contact information (email, phone\
    \ number, or\n      postal address) of the designated contact person.  If the\n\
    \      registrant is a recognized standards development organization,\n      scientific\
    \ society, or similar body requesting the fast-track\n      registration procedure\
    \ (see Section 6.3), that information should\n      be clearly indicated in this\
    \ section of the template.\n   Purpose:  Described in Section 6.4.1 of this document.\n\
    \   Syntax:  Described in Section 6.4.2 of this document.  Unless the\n      registration\
    \ explicitly describes the semantics of r-components,\n      q-components, and\
    \ f-components in the context of this URN\n      namespace, those semantics are\
    \ undefined.\n   Assignment:  Described in Section 6.4.3 of this document.\n \
    \  Security and Privacy:  Described in Section 6.4.4 of this document.\n   Interoperability:\
    \  Described in Section 6.4.5 of this document.\n   Resolution:  Described in\
    \ Section 6.4.6 of this document.\n   Documentation:  A pointer to an RFC, a specification\
    \ published by\n      another standards development organization, or another stable\n\
    \      document that provides further information about this URN\n      namespace.\n\
    \   Additional Information:  Described in Section 6.4.7 of this document.\n  \
    \ Revision Information:  Description of changes from prior version(s).\n     \
    \ (Applicable only when earlier registrations have been revised.)\n"

  - "Appendix B.  Changes from RFC 2141\n   This document makes substantive changes\
    \ from the syntax and semantics\n   of [RFC2141]:\n"
- title: B.1.  Syntax Changes from RFC 2141
  contents:
  - "B.1.  Syntax Changes from RFC 2141\n   The syntax of URNs as provided in [RFC2141]\
    \ was defined before the\n   updated specification of URIs in [RFC3986].  The\
    \ definition of URN\n   syntax is updated in this document to do the following:\n\
    \   o  Ensure consistency with the URI syntax.\n   o  Facilitate the use of URNs\
    \ with parameters similar to URI queries\n      and fragments.\n   o  Permit parameters\
    \ influencing URN resolution.\n   o  Ease the use of URNs with non-URN identifier\
    \ systems that include\n      the \"/\" character.\n   In particular, this specification\
    \ does the following:\n   o  Extends URN syntax to explicitly allow the characters\
    \ \"/\", \"?\",\n      and \"#\", which were reserved for future use by RFC 2141.\
    \  This\n      change also effectively allows several components of the URI\n\
    \      syntax although without necessarily tying those components to URI\n   \
    \   semantics.\n   o  Defines general syntax for an additional component that\
    \ can be\n      used in interactions with a URN resolution service.\n   o  Disallows\
    \ \"-\" at the end of the NID.\n   o  Allows the \"/\", \"~\", and \"&\" characters\
    \ in the NSS.\n   o  Makes several smaller syntax adjustments.\n"
- title: B.2.  Other Changes from RFC 2141
  contents:
  - "B.2.  Other Changes from RFC 2141\n   o  Formally registers \"urn\" as a URI\
    \ scheme.\n   o  Allows what are now called r-components, q-components, and\n\
    \      f-components.\n   In addition, some of the text has been updated to be\
    \ consistent with\n   the definition of URIs [RFC3986] and the processes for registering\n\
    \   information with the IANA [RFC5226], as well as more modern guidance\n   with\
    \ regard to security [RFC3552], privacy [RFC6973], and identifier\n   comparison\
    \ [RFC6943].\n"
- title: Appendix C.  Changes from RFC 3406
  contents:
  - "Appendix C.  Changes from RFC 3406\n   This document makes the following substantive\
    \ changes from [RFC3406]:\n   1.  Relaxes the registration policy for formal URN\
    \ namespaces from\n       \"IETF Review\" to \"Expert Review\" as discussed in\
    \ Section 6.2.\n   2.  Removes the category of experimental URN namespaces, consistent\n\
    \       with [RFC6648].  Experimental URN namespaces were denoted by\n       prefixing\
    \ the namespace identifier with the string \"X-\".  Because\n       experimental\
    \ URN namespaces were never registered, removing the\n       experimental category\
    \ has no impact on the existing registries.\n       Because experimental URN namespaces\
    \ are not managed, strings\n       conforming to URN syntax within experimental\
    \ URN namespaces are\n       not valid URNs.  Truly experimental usages may, of\
    \ course, employ\n       the \"example\" namespace [RFC6963].\n   3.  Adds some\
    \ information to, but generally simplifies, the URN\n       namespace registration\
    \ template.\n"
