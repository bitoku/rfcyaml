  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language\
    \ used to\n   create hypertext documents that are platform independent.  Initially,\n\
    \   the application of HTML on the World Wide Web was seriously\n   restricted\
    \ by its reliance on the ISO-8859-1 coded character set,\n   which is appropriate\
    \ only for Western European languages.  Despite\n   this restriction, HTML has\
    \ been widely used with other languages,\n   using other coded character sets\
    \ or character encodings, through\n   various ad hoc extensions to the language\
    \ [TAKADA].\n   This document is meant to address the issue of the\n   internationalization\
    \ of HTML by extending the specification of HTML\n   and giving additional recommendations\
    \ for proper internationalization\n   support.  It is in good part based on a\
    \ paper by one of the authors\n   on multilingualism on the WWW [NICOL].  A foremost\
    \ consideration is\n   to make sure that HTML remains a valid application of SGML,\
    \ while\n   enabling its use with all languages of the world.\n   The specific\
    \ issues addressed are the SGML document character set to\n   be used for HTML,\
    \ the proper treatment of the charset parameter\n   associated with the \"text/html\"\
    \ content type and the specification of\n   some additional elements and entities.\n"
- title: 1.1 Scope
  contents:
  - "1.1 Scope\n   HTML has been in use by the World-Wide Web (WWW) global information\n\
    \   initiative since 1990.  This specification extends the capabilities\n   of\
    \ HTML 2.0 (RFC 1866), primarily by removing the restriction to the\n   ISO-8859-1\
    \ coded character set [ISO-8859].\n   HTML is an application of ISO Standard 8879:1986,\
    \ Information\n   Processing Text and Office Systems -- Standard Generalized Markup\n\
    \   Language (SGML) [ISO-8879]. The HTML Document Type Definition (DTD)\n   is\
    \ a formal definition of the HTML syntax in terms of SGML.  This\n   specification\
    \ amends the DTD of HTML 2.0 in order to make it\n   applicable to documents encompassing\
    \ a character repertoire much\n   larger than that of ISO-8859-1, while still\
    \ remaining SGML\n   conformant.\n   Both formal and actual development of HTML\
    \ are advancing very fast.\n   The features described in this document are designed\
    \ so that they can\n   (and should) be added to other forms of HTML besides that\
    \ described\n   in RFC 1866. Where indicated, attributes introduced here should\
    \ be\n   extended to the appropriate elements.\n"
- title: 1.2 Conformance
  contents:
  - "1.2 Conformance\n   This specification changes slightly the conformance requirements\
    \ of\n   HTML documents and HTML user agents.\n"
- title: 1.2.1 Documents
  contents:
  - "1.2.1 Documents\n   All HTML 2.0 conforming documents remain conforming with\
    \ this\n   specification.  However, the extensions introduced here make valid\n\
    \   certain documents that would not be HTML 2.0 conforming, in\n   particular\
    \ those containing characters or character references\n   outside of the repertoire\
    \ of ISO 8859-1, and those containing markup\n   introduced herein.\n"
- title: 1.2.2. User agents
  contents:
  - "1.2.2. User agents\n   In addition to the requirements of RFC 1866, the following\n\
    \   requirements are placed on HTML user agents.\n      To ensure interoperability\
    \ and proper support for at least ISO-\n      8859-1 in an environment where character\
    \ encoding schemes other\n      than ISO-8859-1 are present, user agents MUST\
    \ correctly interpret\n      the charset parameter accompanying an HTML document\
    \ received from\n      the network.\n      Furthermore, conforming user-agents\
    \ MUST at least parse correctly\n      all numeric character references within\
    \ the range of ISO 10646-1\n      [ISO-10646].\n      Conforming user-agents are\
    \ required to apply the BIDI presentation\n      algorithm if they display right-to-left\
    \ characters.  If there is\n      no displayable right-to-left character in a\
    \ document, there is no\n      need to apply BIDI processing.\n"

- title: 2.1. Reference processing model
  contents:
  - "2.1. Reference processing model\n   This overview explains a reference processing\
    \ model used for HTML,\n   and in particular the SGML concept of a document character\
    \ set. An\n   actual implementation may widely differ in its internal workings\
    \ from\n   the model given below, but should behave as described to an outside\n\
    \   observer.\n   Because there are various widely differing encodings of text,\
    \ SGML\n   does not directly address how the sequence of characters that\n   constitutes\
    \ an SGML document in the abstract sense are encoded by\n   means of a sequence\
    \ of octets (or occasionally bit groups of another\n   length than 8) in a concrete\
    \ realization of the document such as a\n   computer file. This encoding is called\
    \ the external character\n   encoding of the concrete SGML document, and it should\
    \ be carefully\n   distinguished from the document character set of the abstract\
    \ HTML\n   document.  SGML views the characters as a single set (called a\n  \
    \ \"character repertoire\"), and a \"code set\" that assigns an integer\n   number\
    \ (known as \"character number\") to each character in the\n   repertoire.  The\
    \ document character set declaration defines what each\n   of the character numbers\
    \ represents [GOLD90, p. 451].  In most cases,\n   an SGML DTD and all documents\
    \ that refer to it have a single document\n   character set, and all markup and\
    \ data characters are part of this\n   set.\n   HTML, as an application of SGML,\
    \ does not directly address the\n   question of the external character encoding.\
    \ This is deferred to\n   mechanisms external to HTML, such as MIME as used by\
    \ the HTTP\n   protocol or by electronic mail.\n   For the HTTP protocol [RFC2068],\
    \ the external character encoding is\n   indicated by the \"charset\" parameter\
    \ of the \"Content-Type\" field of\n   the header of an HTTP response. For example,\
    \ to indicate that the\n   transmitted document is encoded in the \"JUNET\" encoding\
    \ of Japanese\n   [RFC1468], the header will contain the following line:\n   Content-Type:\
    \ text/html; charset=ISO-2022-JP\n   The term \"charset\" in MIME is used to designate\
    \ a character encoding,\n   rather than merely a coded character set as the term\
    \ may suggest.  A\n   character encoding is a mapping (possibly many-to-one) of\
    \ sequences\n   of octets to sequences of characters taken from one or more character\n\
    \   repertoires.\n   The HTTP protocol also defines a mechanism for the client\
    \ to specify\n   the character encodings it can accept. Clients and servers are\n\
    \   strongly requested to use these mechanisms to assure correct\n   transmission\
    \ and interpretation of any document. Provisions that can\n   be taken to help\
    \ correct interpretation, even in cases where a server\n   or client do not yet\
    \ use these mechanisms, are described in section\n   6.\n   Similarly, if HTML\
    \ documents are transferred by electronic mail, the\n   external character encoding\
    \ is defined by the \"charset\" parameter of\n   the \"Content-Type\" MIME header\
    \ field [RFC2045], and defaults to US-\n   ASCII in its absence.\n   No mechanisms\
    \ are currently standardized for indicating the external\n   character encoding\
    \ of HTML documents transferred by FTP or accessed\n   in distributed file systems.\n\
    \   In the case any other way of transferring and storing HTML documents\n   are\
    \ defined or become popular, it is advised that similar provisions\n   be made\
    \ to clearly identify the character encoding used and/or to use\n   a single/default\
    \ encoding capable of representing the widest range of\n   characters used in\
    \ an international context.\n   Whatever the external character encoding may be,\
    \ the reference\n   processing model translates it to the document character set\n\
    \   specified in Section 2.2 before processing specific to SGML/HTML.\n   The\
    \ reference processing model can be depicted as follows:\n    [resource]->[decoder]->[entity\
    \ ]->[ SGML ]->[application]->[display]\n                           [manager]\
    \  [parser]\n                                ^          |\n                  \
    \              |          |\n                                +----------+\n  \
    \ The decoder is responsible for decoding the external representation\n   of the\
    \ resource to the document character set.  The entity manager,\n   the parser,\
    \ and the application deal only with characters of the\n    document character\
    \ set.  A display-oriented part of the application\n   or the display machinery\
    \ itself may again convert characters\n   represented in the document character\
    \ set to some other\n   representation more suitable for their purpose. In any\
    \ case, the\n   entity manager, the parser, and the application, as far as character\n\
    \   semantics are concerned, are using the HTML document character set\n   only.\n\
    \   An actual implementation may choose, or not, to translate the\n   document\
    \ into some encoding of the document character set as\n   described above; the\
    \ behaviour described by this reference processing\n   model can be achieved otherwise.\
    \  This subject is well out of the\n   scope of this specification, however, and\
    \ the reader is invited to\n   consult the SGML standard [ISO-8879] or an SGML\
    \ handbook [BRYAN88]\n   [GOLD90] [VANH90] [SQ91] for further information.\n \
    \  The most important consequence of this reference processing model is\n   that\
    \ numeric character references are always resolved with respect to\n   the fixed\
    \ document character set, and thus to the same characters,\n   whatever the external\
    \ encoding actually used. For an example, see\n   Section 2.2.\n"
- title: 2.2. The document character set
  contents:
  - "2.2. The document character set\n   The document character set, in the SGML sense,\
    \ is the Universal\n   Character Set (UCS) of ISO 10646:1993 [ISO-10646], as amended.\n\
    \   Currently, this is code-by-code identical with the Unicode standard,\n   version\
    \ 1.1 [UNICODE].\n      NOTE -- implementers should be aware that ISO 10646 is\
    \ amended\n      from time to time; 4 amendments have been adopted since the\n\
    \      initial 1993 publication, none of which significantly affects this\n  \
    \    specification.  A fifth amendment, now under consideration, will\n      introduce\
    \ incompatible changes to the standard: 6556 Korean Hangul\n      syllables allocated\
    \ between code positions 3400 and 4DFF\n      (hexadecimal) will be moved to new\
    \ positions (and 4516 new\n      syllables added), thus making references to the\
    \ old positions\n      invalid.  Since the Unicode consortium has already adopted\
    \ a\n      corresponding amendment for inclusion in the forthcoming Unicode\n\
    \      2.0, adoption of DAM 5 is considered likely and implementers\n      should\
    \ probably consider the old code positions as already\n      invalid.  Despite\
    \ this one-time change, the relevant standard\n      bodies have committed themselves\
    \ not to change any allocated code\n      position in the future.  To encode Korean\
    \ Hangul irrespective of\n      these changes, the conjoining Hangul Jamo in the\
    \ range 1110-11F9\n      can be used.\n   The adoption of this document character\
    \ set implies a change in the\n   SGML declaration specified in the HTML 2.0 specification\
    \ (section 9.5\n   of [RFC1866]).  The change amounts to removing the first BASESET\n\
    \   specification and its accompanying DESCSET declaration, replacing\n   them\
    \ with the following declaration:\n     BASESET \"ISO Registration Number 177//CHARSET\n\
    \              ISO/IEC 10646-1:1993 UCS-4 with implementation level 3\n      \
    \        //ESC 2/5 2/15 4/6\"\n     DESCSET  0   9     UNUSED\n              9\
    \   2     9\n              11  2     UNUSED\n              13  1     13\n    \
    \          14  18    UNUSED\n              32  95    32\n              127 1 \
    \    UNUSED\n              128 32    UNUSED\n              160 2147483486 160\n\
    \   Making the UCS the document character set does not create non-\n   conformance\
    \ of any expression, construct or document that is\n   conforming to HTML 2.0.\
    \  It does make conforming certain constructs\n   that are not admissible in HTML\
    \ 2.0.  One consequence is that data\n   characters outside the repertoire of\
    \ ISO-8859-1, but within that of\n   UCS-4 become valid SGML characters.  Another\
    \ is that the upper limit\n   of the range of numeric character references is\
    \ extended from 255 to\n   2147483645; thus, &#1048; is a valid reference to a\
    \ \"CYRILLIC CAPITAL\n   LETTER I\".  [ERCS] is a good source of information on\
    \ Unicode and\n   SGML, although its scope and technical content differ greatly\
    \ from\n   this specification.\n      NOTE -- the above SGML declaration, like\
    \ that of HTML 2.0,\n      specifies the character numbers 128 to 159 (80 to 9F\
    \ hex) as\n      UNUSED.  This means that numeric character references within\
    \ that\n      range (e.g.  &#146;) are illegal in HTML. Neither ISO 8859-1 nor\n\
    \      ISO 10646 contain characters in that range, which is reserved for\n   \
    \   control characters.\n   Another change was made from the HTML 2.0 SGML declaration,\
    \ in the\n   belief that the latter did not express its authors' true intent.\
    \ The\n   syntax character set declaration was changed from ISO 646.IRV:1983 to\n\
    \   the newer ISO 646.IRV:1991, the latter, but not the former, being\n   identical\
    \ with US-ASCII.  In principle, this introduces an\n   incompatibility with HTML\
    \ 2.0, but in practice it should increase\n   interoperability by i) having the\
    \ SGML declaration say what everyone\n   thinks and ii) making the syntax character\
    \ set a proper subset of the\n   document character set.  The characters that\
    \ differ between the two\n   versions of ISO 646.IRV are not actually used to\
    \ express HTML syntax.\n   ISO 10646-1:1993 is the most encompassing character\
    \ set currently\n   existing, and there is no other character set that could take\
    \ its\n   place as the document character set for HTML. If nevertheless for a\n\
    \   specific application there is a need to use characters outside this\n   standard,\
    \ this should be done by avoiding any conflicts with present\n   or future versions\
    \ of ISO 10646, i.e. by assigning these characters\n   to a private zone of the\
    \ UCS-4 coding space [ISO-10646 section 11].\n   Also, it should be borne in mind\
    \ that such a use will be highly\n   unportable; in many cases, it may be better\
    \ to use inline bitmaps.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.3. Undisplayable characters\n   With the document character set being the full\
    \ ISO 10646, the\n   possibility that a character cannot be displayed due to lack\

    \   many different things that can be done in such a case, this document\n   does\
    \ not prescribe any specific behaviour. Depending on the\n   implementation, this\
    \ may also be handled by the underlaying display\n   system and not the application\
    \ itself.  The following considerations,\n   however, may be of help:\n   -  A\
    \ clearly visible, but unobtrusive behaviour should be preferred.\n      Some\
    \ documents may contain many characters that cannot be\n      rendered, and so\
    \ showing an alert for each of them is not the\n      right thing to do.\n   -\

- title: 3. The LANG attribute
  contents:
  - "3. The LANG attribute\n   Language tags can be used to control rendering of a\
    \ marked up\n   document in various ways: glyph disambiguation, in cases where\
    \ the\n   character encoding is not sufficient to resolve to a specific glyph;\n\
    \   quotation marks; hyphenation; ligatures; spacing; voice synthesis;\n   etc.\
    \  Independently of rendering issues, language markup is useful as\n   content\
    \ markup for purposes such as classification and searching.\n   Since any text\
    \ can logically be assigned a language, almost all HTML\n   elements admit the\
    \ LANG attribute.  The DTD reflects this; the only\n   elements in this version\
    \ of HTML without the LANG attribute are BR,\n   HR, BASE, NEXTID, and META. \
    \ It is also intended that any new element\n   introduced in later versions of\
    \ HTML will admit the LANG attribute,\n   unless there is a good reason not to\
    \ do so.\n   The language attribute, LANG, takes as its value a language tag that\n\
    \   identifies a natural language spoken, written, or otherwise conveyed\n   by\
    \ human beings for communication of information to other human\n   beings. Computer\
    \ languages are explicitly excluded.\n   The syntax and registry of HTML language\
    \ tags is the same as that\n   defined by RFC 1766 [RFC1766]. In summary, a language\
    \ tag is composed\n   of one or more parts: A primary language tag and a possibly\
    \ empty\n   series of subtags:\n        language-tag  = primary-tag *( \"-\" subtag\
    \ )\n        primary-tag   = 1*8ALPHA\n        subtag        = 1*8ALPHA\n   Whitespace\
    \ is not allowed within the tag and all tags are case-\n   insensitive. The namespace\
    \ of language tags is administered by the\n   IANA. Example tags include:\n  \
    \     en, en-US, en-cockney, i-cherokee, x-pig-latin\n   In the context of HTML,\
    \ a language tag is not to be interpreted as a\n   single token, as per RFC 1766,\
    \ but as a hierarchy. For example, a\n   user agent that adjusts rendering according\
    \ to language should\n   consider that it has a match when a language tag in a\
    \ style sheet\n   entry matches the initial portion of the language tag of an\
    \ element.\n   An exact match should be preferred. This interpretation allows\
    \ an\n   element marked up as, for instance, \"en-US\" to trigger styles\n   corresponding\
    \ to, in order of preference, US-English (\"en-US\") or\n   'plain' or 'international'\
    \ English (\"en\").\n      NOTE -- using the language tag as a hierarchy does\
    \ not imply that\n      all languages with a common prefix will be understood\
    \ by those\n      fluent in one or more of those languages; it simply allows the\n\
    \      user to request this commonality when it is true for that user.\n   The\
    \ rendering of elements may be affected by the LANG attribute.  For\n   any element,\
    \ the value of the LANG attribute overrides the value\n   specified by the LANG\
    \ attribute of any enclosing element and the\n   value (if any) of the HTTP Content-Language\
    \ header. If none of these\n   are set, a suitable default, perhaps controlled\
    \ by user preferences,\n   by automatic context analysis or by the user's locale,\
    \ should be used\n   to control rendering.\n"

  - "4.2.2. List of entities, elements, and attributes\n   First, a generic container\
    \ is needed to carry the LANG and DIR (see\n   below) attributes in cases where\
    \ no other element is appropriate; the\n   SPAN element is introduced for that\
    \ purpose.\n   A set of named character entities is added for use with bidirectional\n\
    \   rendering and cursive joining control:\n   <!ENTITY zwnj CDATA \"&#8204;\"\
    --=zero width non-joiner-->\n   <!ENTITY zwj  CDATA \"&#8205;\"--=zero width joiner-->\n\
    \   <!ENTITY lrm  CDATA \"&#8206;\"--=left-to-right mark-->\n   <!ENTITY rlm \
    \ CDATA \"&#8207;\"--=right-to-left mark-->\n   These entities can be used in\
    \ place of the corresponding formatting\n   characters whenever convenient, for\
    \ example to ease keyboard entry or\n   when a formatting character is not available\
    \ in the character\n   encoding of the document.\n   Next, an attribute called\
    \ DIR is introduced, restricted to the values\n   LTR (left-to-right) and RTL\
    \ (right-to-left), for the indication of\n   directionality in the context of\
    \ bidirectional text (see 4.2.4 below\n   for details).  Since any text and many\
    \ other elements (e.g. tables)\n   can logically be assigned a directionality,\
    \ all elements except BR,\n   HR, BASE, NEXTID, and META admit this attribute.\
    \  The DTD reflects\n   this.  It is also intended that any new element introduced\
    \ in later\n   versions of HTML will admit the DIR attribute, unless there is\
    \ a good\n   reason not to do so.\n   A new phrase-level element called BDO (BIDI\
    \ Override) is introduced,\n   which requires the DIR attribute to specify whether\
    \ the override is\n   left-to-right or right-to-left.  This element is required\
    \ for\n   bidirectional text control; for detailed explanations, see section\n\
    \   4.2.4.\n   The phrase-level element Q is introduced to allow language-dependent\n\
    \   rendering of short quotations depending on language and platform\n   capability.\
    \ As the following examples show (rather poorly, because of\n   the character\
    \ set restriction of Internet specifications), the\n   quotation marks surrounding\
    \ the quotation are particularly affected:\n   \"a quotation in English\", `another,\
    \ slightly better one', ,,a\n   quotation in German'', << a quotation in French\
    \ >>. The contents of\n   the Q element does not include quotation marks, which\
    \ have to be\n   added by the rendering process.\n      NOTE -- Q elements can\
    \ be nested. Many languages use different\n      quotation styles for outer and\
    \ inner quotations, and this should\n      be respected by user-agents implementing\
    \ this element.\n      NOTE -- minimal support for the Q element is to surround\
    \ the\n      contents with some kind of quotes, like the plain ASCII double\n\
    \      quotes.  As this is rather easy to implement, and as the lack of\n    \
    \  any visible quotes may affect the perceived meaning of the text,\n      user-agent\
    \ implementors are strongly requested to provide at least\n      this minimal\
    \ level of support.\n   Many languages require superscript text for proper rendering:\
    \ as an\n   example, the French \"Mlle Dupont\" should have \"lle\" in superscript.\n\
    \   The SUP element, and its sibling SUB for subscript text, are\n   introduced\
    \ to allow proper markup of such text.  SUP and SUB contents\n   are restricted\
    \ to PCDATA to avoid nesting problems.\n   Finally, in many languages text justification\
    \ is much more important\n   than it is in Western languages, and justifies markup.\
    \  The ALIGN\n   attribute, admitting values of LEFT, RIGHT, CENTER and JUSTIFY,\
    \ is\n   added to a selection of elements where it makes sense (the block-like\n\
    \   P, HR, H1 to H6, OL, UL, DIR, MENU, LI, BLOCKQUOTE and ADDRESS).  If\n   a\
    \ user-agent chooses to have LEFT as a default for blocks of left-\n   to-right\
    \ directionality, it should use RIGHT for blocks of right-to-\n   left directionality.\n\
    \      NOTE -- RFC 1866 section 4.2.2 specifies that an HTML user agent\n    \
    \  should treat an end of line as a word space, except in\n      preformatted\
    \ text.  This should be interpreted in the context of\n      the script being\
    \ processed, as the way words are separated in\n      writing is script-dependent.\
    \  For some scripts (e.g. Latin), a\n      word space is just a space, but in\
    \ other scripts (e.g. Thai) it is\n      a zero-width word separator, whereas\
    \ in yet other scripts (e.g.\n      Japanese) it is nothing at all, i.e. totally\
    \ ignored.\n      NOTE -- the SOFT HYPHEN character (U+00AD) needs special attention\n\
    \      from user-agent implementers.  It is present in many character\n      sets\
    \ (including the whole ISO 8859 series and, of course, ISO\n      10646), and\
    \ can always be included by means of the reference\n      &shy;.  Its semantics\
    \ are different from the plain HYPHEN: it\n      indicates a point in a word where\
    \ a line break is allowed.  If the\n      line is indeed broken there, a hyphen\
    \ must be displayed at the end\n      of the first line.  If not, the character\
    \ is not dispalyed at all.\n      In operations like searching and sorting, it\
    \ must always be\n      ignored.\n   In the DTD, the LANG and DIR attributes are\
    \ grouped together in a\n   parameter entity called attrs.  To parallel RFC 1942\
    \ [RFC1942], the\n   ID and CLASS attributes are also included in attrs. The ID\
    \ and CLASS\n   attributes are required for use with style sheets, and RFC 1942\n\
    \   defines them as follows:\n"

  - "4.2.3. Cursive joining behaviour\n   Markup is needed in some cases to force\
    \ cursive joining behavior in\n   contexts in which it would not normally occur,\
    \ or to block it when it\n   would normally occur.\n   The zero-width joiner and\
    \ non-joiner (&zwj; and &zwnj;) are used to\n   control cursive joining behaviour.\
    \  For example, ARABIC LETTER HEH is\n   used in isolation to abbreviate \"Hijri\"\
    \ (the Islamic calendrical\n   system); however, the initial form of the letter\
    \ is desired, because\n   the isolated form of HEH looks like the digit five as\
    \ employed in\n   Arabic script.  This is obtained by following the HEH with a\
    \ zero-\n   width joiner whose only effect is to provide context.  In Persian\n\
    \   texts, there are cases where a letter that normally would join a\n   subsequent\
    \ letter in a cursive connection does not.  Here a zero-\n   width non- joiner\
    \ is used.\n"
- title: 4.2.4. Bidirectional text
  contents:
  - "4.2.4. Bidirectional text\n   Many languages are written in horizontal lines\
    \ from left to right,\n   while others are written from right to left.  When both\
    \ writing\n   directions are present, one talks of bidirectional text (BIDI for\n\
    \   short). BIDI text requires markup in special circumstances where\n   ambiguities\
    \ as to the directionality of some characters have to be\n   resolved.  This markup\
    \ affects the ability to render BIDI text in a\n   semantically legible fashion.\
    \  That is, without this special BIDI\n   markup, cases arise which would prevent\
    \ *any* rendering whatsoever\n   that reflected the basic meaning of the text.\
    \ Plain text may contain\n   BIDI markup in the form of special-purpose formatting\
    \ characters.\n   This is also possible in HTML, which includes the five BIDI-related\n\
    \   formatting characters (202A - 202E) of ISO 10646.  As an alternative,\n  \
    \ HTML provides equivalent SGML markup.\n   BIDI is a complex issue, and conversion\
    \ of logical text sequences to\n   display sequences has to be done according\
    \ to the algorithm and\n   character properties specified in [UNICODE]. Here,\
    \ explanations are\n   given only as far as they are needed to understand the\
    \ necessity of\n   the features introduced and to define their exact semantics.\n\
    \   The Unicode BIDI algorithm is based on the individual characters of a\n  \
    \ text being stored in logical order, that is the order in which they\n   are\
    \ normally input and in which the corresponding sounds are normally\n   spoken.\
    \ To make rendering of logical order text possible, the\n   algorithm assigns\
    \ a directionality property to each character, e.g.\n   Latin letters are specified\
    \ to have a left-to-right direction, Arabic\n   and Hebrew characters have a right-to-left\
    \ direction.\n   The left-to-right and right-to-left marks (&lrm; and &rlm;) are\
    \ used\n   to disambiguate directionality of neutral characters. For example,\n\
    \   when a double quote sits between an Arabic and a Latin letter, its\n   direction\
    \ is ambiguous; if a directional mark is added on one side\n   such that the quotation\
    \ mark is surrounded by characters of only one\n   directionality, the ambiguity\
    \ is removed. These characters are like\n   zero width spaces which have a directional\
    \ property (but no word/line\n   break property).\n   Nested embeddings of contra-directional\
    \ text runs, due to nested\n   quotations or to the pasting of text from one BIDI\
    \ context to\n   another, is also a case where the implicit directionality of\n\
    \   characters is not sufficient, requiring markup.  Also, it is\n   frequently\
    \ desirable to specify the basic directionality of a block\n   of text. For these\
    \ purposes, the DIR attribute is used.\n   On block-type elements, the DIR attribute\
    \ indicates the base\n   directionality of the text in the block; if omitted it\
    \ is inherited\n   from the parent element.  The default directionality of the\
    \ overall\n   HTML document is left-to-right.\n   On inline elements, it makes\
    \ the element start a new embedding level\n   (to be explained below); if omitted\
    \ the inline element does not start\n   a new embedding level.\n      NOTE --\
    \ the PRE, XMP and LISTING elements admit the DIR attribute.\n      Their contents\
    \ should not be considered as preformatted with\n      respect to bidirectional\
    \ layout, but the BIDI algorithm should be\n      applied to each line of text.\n\
    \   Following is an example of a case where embedding is needed, showing\n   its\
    \ effect:\n      Given the following latin (upper case) and arabic (lower case)\n\
    \      letters in backing store with the specified embeddings:\n      <SPAN DIR=LTR>\
    \ AB <SPAN DIR=RTL> xy <SPAN DIR=LTR> CD </SPAN> zw\n      </SPAN> EF </SPAN>\n\
    \      One gets the following rendering (with [] showing the directional\n   \
    \   transitions):\n      [ AB [ wz [ CD ] yx ] EF ]\n      On the other hand,\
    \ without this markup and with a base direction\n      of LTR one gets the following\
    \ rendering:\n      [ AB [ yx ] CD [ wz ] EF ]\n      Notice that yx is on the\
    \ left and wz on the right unlike the above\n      case where the embedding levels\
    \ are used.  Without the embedding\n      markup one has at most two levels: a\
    \ base directional level and a\n      single counterflow directional level.\n\
    \   The DIR attribute on inline elements is equivalent to the formatting\n   characters\
    \  LEFT-TO-RIGHT EMBEDDING (202A) and RIGHT-TO-LEFT\n   EMBEDDING (202B) of ISO\
    \ 10646.  The end tag of the element is\n   equivalent to the POP DIRECTIONAL\
    \ FORMATTING (202C) character.\n   Directional override, as provided by the BDO\
    \ element, is needed to\n   deal with unusual short pieces of text in which directionality\
    \ cannot\n   be resolved from context in an unambiguous fashion. For example,\
    \ it\n   can be used to force left-to-right (or right-to-left) display of part\n\
    \   numbers composed of Latin letters, digits and Hebrew letters.\n   The effect\
    \ of BDO is to force the directionality of all characters\n   within it to the\
    \ value of DIR, irrespective of their intrinsic\n   directional properties.  It\
    \ is equivalent to using the LEFT-TO-RIGHT\n   OVERRIDE (202D) or RIGHT-TO-LEFT\
    \ OVERRIDE (202E) characters of ISO\n   10646, the end tag again being equivalent\
    \ to the POP DIRECTIONAL\n   FORMATTING (202C) character.\n      NOTE -- authors\
    \ and authoring software writers should be aware\n      that conflicts can arise\
    \ if the DIR attribute is used on inline\n      elements (including BDO) concurrently\
    \ with the use of the\n      corresponding ISO 10646 formatting characters.\n\
    \      Preferably one or the other should be used exclusively; the markup\n  \
    \    method is better able to guarantee document structural integrity,\n     \
    \ and alleviates some problems when editing bidirectional HTML text\n      with\
    \ a simple text editor, but some software may be more apt at\n      using the\
    \ 10646 characters.  If both methods are used, great care\n      should be exercised\
    \ to insure proper nesting of markup and\n      directional embedding or override;\
    \ otherwise, rendering results\n      are undefined.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1. DTD additions\n   It is natural to expect input in any language in forms,\
    \ as they\n   provide one of the only ways of obtaining user input. While this\
    \ is\n   primarily a UI issue, there are some things that should be specified\n\
    \   at the HTML level to guide behavior and promote interoperability.\n   To ensure\
    \ full interoperability, it is necessary for the user agent\n   (and the user)\
    \ to have an indication of the character encoding(s)\n   that the server providing\
    \ a form will be able to handle upon\n   submission of the filled-in form.  Such\
    \ an indication is provided by\n   the ACCEPT-CHARSET attribute of the INPUT and\
    \ TEXTAREA elements,\n   modeled on the HTTP Accept-Charset header (see [HTTP-1.1]),\
    \ which\n   contains a space and/or comma delimited list of character sets\n \
    \  acceptable to the server.  A user agent may want to somehow advise\n   the\
    \ user of the contents of this attribute, or to restrict his\n   possibility to\
    \ enter characters outside the repertoires of the listed\n   character sets.\n\
    \      NOTE -- The list of character sets is to be interpreted as an\n      EXCLUSIVE-OR\
    \ list; the server announces that it is ready to accept\n      any ONE of these\
    \ character encoding schemes for each part of a\n      multipart entity.  The\
    \ client may perform character encoding\n      translation to satisfy the server\
    \ if necessary.\n      NOTE -- The default value for the ACCEPT-CHARSET attribute\
    \ of an\n      INPUT or TEXTAREA element is the reserved value \"UNKNOWN\".  A\
    \ user\n      agent may interpret that value as the character encoding scheme\n\

- title: 5.2. Form submission
  contents:
  - "5.2. Form submission\n   The HTML 2.0 form submission mechanism, based on the\
    \ \"application/x-\n   www-form-urlencoded\" media type, is ill-equipped with\
    \ regard to\n   internationalization.  In fact, since URLs are restricted to ASCII\n\
    \   characters, the mechanism is akward even for ISO-8859-1 text.\n   Section\
    \ 2.2 of [RFC1738] specifies that octets may be encoded using\n   the \"%HH\"\
    \ notation, but text submitted from a form is composed of\n   characters, not\
    \ octets.  Lacking a specification of a character\n   encoding scheme, the \"\
    %HH\" notation has no well-defined meaning.\n   The best solution is to use the\
    \ \"multipart/form-data\" media type\n   described in [RFC1867] with the POST\
    \ method of form submission.  This\n   mechanism encapsulates the value part of\
    \ each name-value pair in a\n   body-part of a multipart MIME body that is sent\
    \ as the HTTP entity;\n   each body part can be labeled with an appropriate Content-Type,\n\
    \   including if necessary a charset parameter that specifies the\n   character\
    \ encoding scheme.  The changes to the DTD necessary to\n   support this method\
    \ of form submission have been incorporated in the\n   DTD included in this specification.\n\
    \   A less satisfactory solution is to add a MIME charset parameter to\n   the\
    \ \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" media type specifier sent\n   along with\
    \ a POST method form submission, with the understanding that\n   the URL encoding\
    \ of [RFC1738] is applied on top of the specified\n   character encoding, as a\
    \ kind of implicit Content-Transfer-Encoding.\n   One problem with both solutions\
    \ above is that current browsers do not\n   generally allow for bookmarks to specify\
    \ the POST method; this should\n   be improved.  Conversely, the GET method could\
    \ be used with the form\n   data transmitted in the body instead of in the URL.\
    \  Nothing in the\n   protocol seems to prevent it, but no implementations appear\
    \ to exist\n   at present.\n   How the user agent determines the encoding of the\
    \ text entered by the\n   user is outside the scope of this specification.\n \
    \     NOTE -- Designers of forms and their handling scripts should be\n      aware\
    \ of an important caveat: when the default value of a field\n      (the VALUE\
    \ attribute) is returned upon form submission (i.e. the\n      user did not modify\
    \ this value), it cannot be guaranteed to be\n      transmitted as a sequence\
    \ of octets identical to that in the\n      source document -- only as a possibly\
    \ different but valid encoding\n      of the same sequence of text elements. \
    \ This may be true even if\n      the encoding of the document containing the\
    \ form and that used for\n      submission are the same.\n      Differences can\
    \ occur when a sequence of characters can be\n      represented by various sequences\
    \ of octets, and also when a\n      composite sequence (a base character plus\
    \ one or more combining\n      diacritics) can be represented by either a different\
    \ but\n      equivalent composite sequence or by a fully precomposed character.\n\
    \      For instance, the UCS-2 sequence 00EA+0323 (LATIN SMALL LETTER E\n    \
    \  WITH CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT + COMBINING DOT BELOW) may be transformed\n      into\
    \ 1EC7 (LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT AND DOT\n      BELOW), into\
    \ 0065+0302+0323 (LATIN SMALL LETTER E + COMBINING\n      CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT +\
    \ COMBINING DOT BELOW), as well as into other\n      equivalent composite sequences.\n"
- title: 6. External character encoding issues
  contents:
  - "6. External character encoding issues\n   Proper interpretation of a text document\
    \ requires that the character\n   encoding scheme be known.  Current HTTP servers,\
    \ however, do not\n   generally include an appropriate charset parameter with\
    \ the Content-\n   Type header.  This is bad behaviour, which is even encouraged\
    \ by the\n   continued existence of browsers that declare an unrecognized media\n\
    \   type when they receive a charset parameter.  User agent\n   implementators\
    \ are strongly encouraged to make their software\n   tolerant of this parameter,\
    \ even if they cannot take advantage of it.\n   Proper labelling is highly desirable,\
    \ but some preventive measures\n   can be taken to minimize the detrimental effects\
    \ of its absence:\n   In the case where a document is accessed from a hyperlink\
    \ in an\n   origin HTML document, a CHARSET attribute is added to the attribute\n\
    \   list of elements with link semantics (A and LINK), specifically by\n   adding\
    \ it to the linkExtraAttributes entity.  The value of that\n   attribute is to\
    \ be considered a hint to the User Agent as to the\n   character encoding scheme\
    \ used by the resource pointed to by the\n   hyperlink; it should be the appropriate\
    \ value of the MIME charset\n   parameter for that resource.\n   In any document,\
    \ it is possible to include an indication of the\n   encoding scheme like the\
    \ following, as early as possible within the\n   HEAD of the document:\n    <META\
    \ HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\"\n     CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=ISO-2022-JP\"\
    >\n   This is not foolproof, but will work if the encoding scheme is such\n  \
    \ that ASCII-valued octets stand for ASCII characters only at least\n   until\
    \ the META element is parsed.  Note that there are better ways\n   for a server\
    \ to obtain character encoding information, instead of the\n   unreliable META\
    \ above; see [NICOL2] for some details and a proposal.\n   For definiteness, the\
    \ \"charset\" parameter received from the source of\n   the document should be\
    \ considered the most authoritative, followed in\n   order of preference by the\
    \ contents of a META element such as the\n   above, and finally the CHARSET parameter\
    \ of the anchor that was\n   followed (if any).\n   When HTML text is transmitted\
    \ directly in UCS-2 or UCS-4 form, the\n   question of byte order arises: does\
    \ the high-order byte of each\n   multi-byte character come first or last?  For\
    \ definiteness, this\n   specification recommends that UCS-2 and UCS-4 be transmitted\
    \ in big-\n   endian byte order (high order byte first), which corresponds to\
    \ the\n   established network byte order for two- and four-byte quantities, to\n\
    \   the ISO 10646 requirement and Unicode recommendation for serialized\n   text\
    \ data and to RFC 1641.  Furthermore, to maximize chances of\n   proper interpretation,\
    \ it is recommended that documents transmitted\n   as UCS-2 or UCS-4 always begin\
    \ with a ZERO-WIDTH NON-BREAKING SPACE\n   character (hexadecimal FEFF or 0000FEFF)\
    \ which, when byte-reversed\n   becomes number FFFE or FFFE0000, a character guaranteed\
    \ to be never\n   assigned.  Thus, a user-agent receiving an FFFE as the first\
    \ octets\n   of a text would know that bytes have to be reversed for the remainder\n\
    \   of the text.\n   There exist so-called UCS Transformation Formats than can\
    \ be used to\n   transmit UCS data, in addition to UCS-2 and UCS-4.  UTF-7 [RFC1642]\n\
    \   and UTF-8 [UTF-8] have favorable properties (no byte-ordering\n   problem,\
    \ different flavours of ASCII compatibility) that make them\n   worthy of consideration,\
    \ especially for transmission of multilingual\n   text.  Another encoding scheme,\
    \ MNEM [RFC1345], also has interesting\n   properties and the capability to transmit\
    \ the full UCS.  The UTF-1\n   transformation format of ISO 10646:1993 (registered\
    \ by IANA as ISO-\n   10646-UTF-1), has been removed from ISO 10646 by amendment\
    \ 4, and\n   should not be used.\n"
