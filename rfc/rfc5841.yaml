  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In an attempt to anthropomorphize the bit streams on countless\n\
    \   physical layer networks throughout the world, we propose a TCP option\n  \
    \ to express packet mood [DSM-IV].\n   Packets cannot feel.  They are created\
    \ for the purpose of moving data\n   from one system to another.  However, it\
    \ is clear that in specific\n   situations some measure of emotion can be inferred\
    \ or added.  For\n   instance, a packet that is retransmitted to resend data for\
    \ a packet\n   for which no ACK was received could be described as an 'angry'\n\
    \   packet, or a 'frustrated' packet (if it is not the first\n   retransmission\
    \ for instance).  So how can these kinds of feelings be\n   conveyed in the packets\
    \ themselves.  This can be addressed by adding\n   TCP Options [RFC793] to the\
    \ TCP header, using ASCII characters that\n   encode commonly used \"emoticons\"\
    \ to convey packet mood.\n"

    \   field [RFC793].  It is proposed that option 25 (released 2000-12-18)\n   be\
    \ used to define packet mood.  This option would have a length value\n   of 4\
    \ or 5 bytes.  All the simple emotions described as expressible\n   via this mechanism\
    \ can be displayed with two or three 7-bit, ASCII-\n   encoded characters.  Multiple\
    \ mood options may appear in a TCP\n   header, so as to express more complex moods\

- title: 4.  Use Cases
  contents:
  - "4.  Use Cases\n   There are two ways to denote packet mood.  One is to infer\
    \ the mood\n   based on an event in the TCP session.  The other is to derive mood\n\
    \   from a higher-order action at a higher layer (subject matter of\n   payload\
    \ for instance).\n   For packets where the 'mood' is inferred from activity within\
    \ the TCP\n   session, the 'mood' MUST be set by the host that is watching for\
    \ the\n   trigger event.  If a client sends a frame and receives no ACK, then\n\
    \   the retransmitted frame MAY contain the TCP OPTION header with a mood\n  \
    \ set.\n   Any packet that exhibits behavior that allows for mood to be inferred\n\
    \   SHOULD add the TCP OPTION to the packets with the implied mood.\n   Applications\
    \ can take advantage of the defined moods by expressing\n   them in the packets.\
    \  This can be done in the SYN packet sent from\n   the client.  All packets in\
    \ the session can be then tagged with the\n   mood set in the SYN packet, but\
    \ this would have a per-packet\n   performance cost (see Section 5, \"Performance\
    \ Considerations\").\n   Each application MUST define the preconditions for marking\
    \ packets as\n   happy, sad, bored, confused, angry, apathetic, and so on.  This\
    \ is a\n   framework for defining how such moods can be expressed, but it is up\n\
    \   to the developers to determine when to apply these encoded labels.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Happy Packets
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Happy Packets\n   Healthy packets are happy packets you could say.  If\
    \ the ACK packets\n   return within <10 ms end-to-end from a sender's stack to\
    \ a receiver's\n   stack and back again, this would reflect high-speed bidirectional\n\
    \   capability, and if no retransmits are required and all ACKs are\n   received,\
    \ all subsequent packets in that session SHOULD be marked as\n   'happy'.\n  \
    \ No loss, low-latency packets also makes for happy users.  So the\n   packet\
    \ would be reflecting the end-user experience.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Sad Packets
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Sad Packets\n   If retransmission rates achieve greater than 20% of all\
    \ packets sent\n   in a session, it is fair to say the session can be in mourning\
    \ for\n   all of the good packets lost in the senseless wasteland of the wild\n\
    \   Internet.\n   This should not be confused with retransmitted packets marked\
    \ as\n   'angry' since this tag would apply to all frames in the session\n   numbed\
    \ by the staggering loss of packet life.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Amused Packets
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Amused Packets\n   Any packet that is carrying a text joke SHOULD be marked\
    \ as 'amused'.\n   Example:\n      1: Knock Knock\n      2: Who's there?\n   \
    \   1: Impatient chicken\n      2: Impatient chi...\n      1: BAWK!!!!\n   If\
    \ such a joke is in the packet payload then, honestly, how can you\n   not be\
    \ amused by one of the only knock-knock jokes that survives the\n   3rd grade?\n"
- title: 4.4.  Confused Packets
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Confused Packets\n   When is a packet confused?  There are network elements\
    \ that perform\n   per-packet load balancing, and if there are asymmetries in\
    \ the\n   latencies between end-to-end paths, out-of-order packet delivery can\n\
    \   occur.\n   When a receiver host gets out-of-order packets, it SHOULD mark\
    \ TCP\n   ACK packets sent back to the sender as confused.\n   The same can be\
    \ said for packets that are sent to incorrect VLAN\n   segments or are misdirected.\
    \  The receivers might be aware that the\n   packet is confused, but there is\
    \ no way to know at ingress if that\n   will be the fate of the frame.\n   That\
    \ being said, application developers SHOULD mark packets as\n   confused if the\
    \ payload contains complex philosophical questions that\n   make one ponder the\
    \ meaning of life and one's place in the universe.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Bored Packets
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Bored Packets\n   Packets carrying accounting data with debits, credits,\
    \ and so on MUST\n   be marked as 'bored'.\n   It could be said that many people\
    \ consider RFCs boring.  Packets\n   containing RFC text MAY be marked as 'bored'.\n\
    \   Packets with phone book listings MUST be marked 'bored'.\n   Packets containing\
    \ legal disclaimers and anything in Latin SHOULD be\n   marked 'bored'.\n"
- title: 4.6.  Surprised Packets
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Surprised Packets\n   Who doesn't love when the out-of-order packets in\
    \ your session\n   surprise you while waiting in a congested queue for 20 ms?\n\
    \   Packets do not have birthdays, so packets can be marked as surprised\n   when\
    \ they encounter unexpected error conditions.\n   So when ICMP destination unreachable\
    \ messages are received (perhaps\n   due to a routing loop or congestion discards),\
    \ all subsequent packets\n   in that session SHOULD be marked as surprised.\n"
- title: 4.7.  Silly Packets
  contents:
  - "4.7.  Silly Packets\n   Not all packets are sent as part of a session.  Random\
    \ keepalives\n   during a TCP session MAY be set up as a repartee between systems\n\
    \   connected as client and server.  Such random and even playful\n   interchanges\
    \ SHOULD be marked as silly.\n"
- title: 4.8.  Frustrated Packets
  contents:
  - "4.8.  Frustrated Packets\n   Packets that are retransmitted more than once SHOULD\
    \ be marked as\n   frustrated.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.9.  Angry Packets\n   Packets that are retransmitted SHOULD be marked as angry.\n"
- title: 4.10.  Apathetic Packets
  contents:
  - "4.10.  Apathetic Packets\n   When sending a RST packet to a connected system,\
    \ the packet should be\n   marked as apathetic so that the receiver knows that\
    \ your system does\n   not care what happens after that.\n"
- title: 4.11.  Sneaky Packets
  contents:
  - "4.11.  Sneaky Packets\n   When a packet is used in a particularly clever way,\
    \ it SHOULD be\n   marked as sneaky.  What is \"clever\" is rather subjective,\
    \ so it would\n   be prudent to get a few opinions about a particular use to make\
    \ sure\n   that it is clever.\n"
- title: 4.12.  Evil Packets
  contents:
  - "4.12.  Evil Packets\n   It is hard for a TCP packet to discern higher moral quandaries\
    \ like\n   the meaning of life or what exactly defines 'evil' and from whose\n\
    \   perspective such a characterization is being made.  However,\n   developers\
    \ of TCP-based applications MAY choose to see some\n   activities as evil when\
    \ viewed through their particular lens of the\n   world.  At that point, they\
    \ SHOULD mark packets as evil.\n   Some organizations are prohibited from using\
    \ this mood by mission\n   statement.  This would also prohibit using the security\
    \ flag in the\n   IP header described in [RFC3514] for the same reasons.\n"
- title: 5.  Performance Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Performance Considerations\n   Adding extensions to the TCP header has a\
    \ cost.  Using TCP extensions\n   with the ASCII-encoded mood of the packet would\
    \ detract from the\n   available MSS usable for data payload.  If the TCP header\
    \ is more\n   than 20 bytes, then the extra bytes would be unavailable for use\
    \ in\n   the payload of the frame.\n   This added per-packet overhead should be\
    \ considered when using packet\n   mood extensions.\n"
