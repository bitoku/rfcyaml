Abstract The RTP (Real time Transport Protocol) payload format for generic forward error correction allows RTP participants to improve loss resiliency through the use of traditional parity based channel codes.
This payload format requires four new MIME types, audio/parityfec, video/parityfec, text/parityfec and application/parityfec.
This document serves as the MIME type registration for those formats.
The RTP payload format for generic forward error correction [1] allows RTP participants to improve loss resiliency through the use of traditional parity based channel codes.
This payload format requires four new MIME types, audio/parityfec, video/parityfec, text/paritfyfec and application/parityfec.
RFC 2048 [2] defines procedures for registration of new MIME types within the IETF tree.
Furthermore, the Audio/Video Transport working group has defined additional procedures that must be followed when registering RTP payload formats [3].
This document serves as the MIME type registration for those formats based on those procedures.
Subject: Registration of MIME media type audio/parityfec MIME media type name:
none Note that [3] mandates that RTP payload formats without a defined rate must define a rate parameter as part of their MIME registration.
The payload format for generic forward error correction [1] does not specify a rate parameter.
However, the rate for FEC data is equal to the rate of the media data it protects.
Optional parameters: none Typical optional parameters [3], such as the number of channels, and the duration of audio per packet, do not apply to FEC data.
The number of channels is effectively the same as the media data it protects; the same is true for the duration of audio per packet.
Encoding considerations: This format is only defined for transport within the Real Time Transport protocol (RTP) [4,5].
Its transport within RTP is fully specified with RFC 2733 [1].
Security considerations: the same security considerations apply to these mime registrations as to the payloads for for them, as detailed in RFC 2733.
Interoperability considerations: none Published specification:
This MIME type is described fully within RFC 2733 [1].
Applications which use this media type: Audio and video streaming tools which seek to improve resiliency to loss by sending additional data with the media stream.
