  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) [RFC8711]\
    \ is\n   responsible for arranging the selection and operation of the IETF\n \
    \  plenary meeting venue.  The purpose of this document is to guide the\n   IASA\
    \ in their selection of regions, cities, facilities, and hotels.\n   The IASA\
    \ should apply this guidance at different points in the\n   process in an attempt\
    \ to faithfully meet the requirements of the IETF\n   community.  We specify a\
    \ set of general criteria for venue selection\n   and several requirements for\
    \ transparency and community consultation.\n   It remains the responsibility of\
    \ the IASA to apply their best\n   judgment.  The IASA accepts input and feedback\
    \ during the\n   consultation process and later (for instance, when there are\
    \ changes\n   in the situation at a chosen location).  The community is encouraged\n\
    \   to provide direct feedback about the IASA's performance to the IETF\n   Administration\
    \ LLC, the Nominations Committee (NOMCOM), or the\n   Internet Engineering Steering\
    \ Group (IESG).  Any reviews of IASA\n   decisions remain subject to the provisions\
    \ of Section 4.7 of\n   [RFC8711] (BCP 101).\n   The following four terms describe\
    \ the places for which the IETF\n   contracts services:\n   Venue:\n      An umbrella\
    \ term for the city, meeting resources, and guest room\n      resources.\n   Facility:\n\
    \      The building that houses meeting rooms and associated resources.\n    \
    \  It may also house an IETF Hotel.\n   IETF Hotels:\n      One or more hotels,\
    \ in close proximity to the Facility, where the\n      IETF guest room block allocations\
    \ are negotiated and where network\n      services managed by the IASA (e.g.,\
    \ the \"IETF\" SSID) are in use.\n   Overflow Hotels:\n      One or more hotels,\
    \ usually in close proximity to the Facility,\n      where the IETF has negotiated\
    \ a group room rate for the purposes\n      of the meeting.  Of particular note\
    \ is that Overflow Hotels are\n      not usually connected to the IETF network\
    \ and do not use network\n      services managed by the IASA.\n   The key words\
    \ \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\"\
    , \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\"\
    \ in this document are to be interpreted as described in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119]\
    \ [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Core Values
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Core Values\n   Some IETF values pervade the selection process.  These\
    \ are often\n   applicable to multiple requirements listed in this document. \
    \ At a\n   minimum, they include the following:\n   Why we meet:\n      We meet\
    \ to pursue the IETF's mission [RFC3935].  This is partly\n      done by advancing\
    \ the development of Internet-Drafts and RFCs.  We\n      also seek to facilitate\
    \ attendee participation in multiple topics\n      and to enable cross-pollination\
    \ of ideas and technologies.\n   Inclusiveness:\n      We would like to facilitate\
    \ the on-site or remote participation of\n      anyone who wants to be involved.\
    \  Widespread participation\n      contributes to the diversity of perspectives\
    \ represented in the\n      working sessions.\n      Every country has limits\
    \ on who it will permit within its borders.\n      However, the IETF seeks to:\n\
    \      1.  Minimize situations in which onerous entry regulations\n          inhibit,\
    \ discourage, or prevent participants from attending\n          meetings; failing\
    \ that, meeting locations are to be\n          distributed such that onerous entry\
    \ regulations are not always\n          experienced by the same attendees; and\n\
    \      2.  Avoid meeting in countries with laws that effectively exclude\n   \
    \       people on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, gender,\n          sexual\
    \ orientation, national origin, citizenship, or gender\n          identity.\n\
    \   Where we meet:\n      We meet in different global locations, in order to spread\
    \ the\n      difficulty and cost of travel among active participants, balancing\n\
    \      travel time and expense across participants based in various\n      regions.\
    \  Our regional location policy is articulated in\n      [RFC8719].\n   Internet\
    \ Access:\n      As an organization, we write specifications for the Internet,\
    \ and\n      we use it heavily.  Meeting attendees need unfiltered access to\n\
    \      the general Internet and their corporate networks.  \"Unfiltered\n    \
    \  access\", in this case, means that all forms of communication are\n      allowed.\
    \  This includes, but is not limited to, access to\n      corporate networks via\
    \ encrypted VPNs from the meeting Facility\n      and Hotels, including Overflow\
    \ Hotels.  We also need open network\n      access available at high enough data\
    \ rates, at the meeting\n      Facility, to support our work, which includes support\
    \ of remote\n      participation.  Beyond this, we are the first users of our\
    \ own\n      technology.  Any filtering may cause a problem with that\n      technology\
    \ development.  In some cases, local laws may require\n      some filtering. \
    \ We seek to avoid such locales without reducing\n      the pool of cities to\
    \ an unacceptable level by stating a number of\n      criteria below, one mandatory\
    \ and others important, to allow for\n      the case where local laws may require\
    \ filtering in some\n      circumstances.\n   Focus:\n      We meet to have focused\
    \ technical discussions.  These are not\n      limited to scheduled breakout sessions,\
    \ although of course those\n      are important.  They also happen over meals\
    \ or drinks, through a\n      specific type of non-session that we call a \"Bar\
    \ BOF\", or in side\n      meetings.  Environments that are noisy or distracting\
    \ prevent or\n      reduce the effectiveness of these sessions and are therefore\
    \ less\n      desirable as a meeting Facility [RFC6771].\n   Economics:\n    \
    \  Meeting attendees participate as individuals.  While many are\n      underwritten\
    \ by employers or sponsors, many are self-funded.  In\n      order to reduce participation\
    \ costs and travel effort, we\n      therefore seek locations that provide convenient\
    \ budget\n      alternatives for food and lodging, and that minimize travel\n\
    \      segments from major airports to the Venue.  Within reason, one's\n    \
    \  budget should not be a barrier to accommodation.\n   Least Astonishment and\
    \ Openness:\n      Regular participants should not be surprised by meeting Venue\n\
    \      selections, particularly when it comes to locales.  To avoid\n      surprise,\
    \ the venue selection process, as with all other IETF\n      processes, should\
    \ be as open as practicable.  It should be\n      possible for the community to\
    \ engage in discussion early to\n      express its views on prospective selections,\
    \ so that the community\n      and the IASA can exchange views as to appropriateness\
    \ long before\n      a venue contract is considered.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Venue Selection Non-objectives
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Venue Selection Non-objectives\n   IETF meeting Venues are not selected\
    \ or declined with the explicit\n   purposes of:\n   Politics:\n      Endorsing\
    \ or condemning particular countries, political paradigms,\n      laws, regulations,\
    \ or policies.\n   Maximal attendance:\n      While the IETF strives to be as\
    \ inclusive as possible, both online\n      and in person, maximal meeting attendance\
    \ in and of itself is not\n      a goal.  It would defeat a key goal of meeting\
    \ if active\n      contributors with differing points of view did not have the\n\
    \      opportunity to resolve their disagreements, no matter how full the\n  \
    \    rooms.\n   Tourism:\n      Variety in site-seeing experiences.\n"
- title: 3.  Meeting Criteria
  contents:
  - "3.  Meeting Criteria\n   This section contains the criteria for IETF meetings.\
    \  It is broken\n   down into three subsections: mandatory criteria (Section 3.1),\n\
    \   important criteria (Section 3.2), and other considerations\n   (Section 3.3),\
    \ each as explained below.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Mandatory Criteria
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Mandatory Criteria\n   If criteria in this subsection cannot be met, a\
    \ particular location\n   is unacceptable for selection, and the IASA MUST NOT\
    \ enter into a\n   contract.  Should the IASA learn that a location can no longer\
    \ meet a\n   mandatory requirement after having entered into a contract, it will\n\
    \   inform the community and address the matter on a case-by-case basis.\n   *\
    \  The Facility MUST provide sufficient space in an appropriate\n      layout\
    \ to accommodate the number of participants, leadership, and\n      support staff\
    \ expected to attend that meeting.\n   *  The Facility and IETF Hotels MUST provide\
    \ wheelchair access to\n      accommodate the number of people who are anticipated\
    \ to require\n      it.\n   *  It MUST be possible to provision Internet Access\
    \ to the Facility\n      and IETF Hotels that allows those attending in person\
    \ to utilize\n      the Internet for all their IETF, business, and day-to-day\
    \ needs;\n      in addition, there must be sufficient bandwidth and access for\n\
    \      remote attendees.  Provisions include, but are not limited to,\n      native\
    \ and unmodified IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity, and global\n      reachability; there\
    \ may be no additional limitation that would\n      materially impact their Internet\
    \ use.  To ensure availability, it\n      MUST be possible to provision redundant\
    \ paths to the Internet.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Important Criteria
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Important Criteria\n   The criteria in this subsection are not mandatory,\
    \ but they are still\n   highly significant.  It may be necessary to trade-off\
    \ one or more of\n   these criteria against others.  A Venue that meets more of\
    \ these\n   criteria is, on the whole, preferable to another that meets fewer\
    \ of\n   these criteria.  Requirements classed as Important can also be\n   balanced\
    \ across Venue selections for multiple meetings.  When a\n   particular requirement\
    \ in this section cannot be met but the Venue is\n   selected anyway, the IASA\
    \ MUST notify the community at the time of\n   the venue announcement.  Furthermore,\
    \ it may be appropriate for the\n   IASA to assist those who, as a result, have\
    \ been inconvenienced in\n   some way.\n"
- title: 3.2.1.  Venue City Criteria
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Venue City Criteria\n   The following requirements relate to the Venue\
    \ city.\n   *  Travel to the Venue is acceptable based on cost, time, and burden\n\
    \      for participants traveling from multiple regions.  It is\n      anticipated\
    \ that the burden borne will generally be shared over\n      the course of multiple\
    \ years.\n   *  The Venue is assessed as favorable for obtaining a host and\n\
    \      sponsors.  That is, the Meeting is in a location in which it is\n     \
    \ possible and probable to find a host and sponsors.\n   *  Travel barriers to\
    \ entry, including visa requirements, are likely\n      to be such that an overwhelming\
    \ majority of participants who wish\n      to do so can attend.  The term \"travel\
    \ barriers\" is to be read\n      broadly by the IASA in the context of whether\
    \ a successful meeting\n      can be had.\n   *  Economic, safety, and health\
    \ risks associated with this Venue are\n      acceptable.\n   *  The selection\
    \ of the venue comports with the practices described\n      in [RFC8719].\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  Basic Venue Criteria
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Basic Venue Criteria\n   The following requirements relate to the Venue\
    \ and Facilities.\n   The IETF operates internationally and adjusts to local requirements.\n\
    \   Facilities selected for IETF meetings SHALL have provided written\n   assurance\
    \ that they are in compliance with local health, safety, and\n   accessibility\
    \ laws and regulations, and that they will remain in\n   compliance throughout\
    \ our stay.\n   In addition:\n   *  There are sufficient places (e.g., a mix of\
    \ hallways, bars,\n      meeting rooms, and restaurants) for people to hold ad\
    \ hoc\n      conversations and group discussions in the combination of spaces\n\
    \      offered by the facilities, hotels, and bars/restaurants in the\n      surrounding\
    \ area, within walking distance (5-10 minutes).\n   *  The cost of guest rooms,\
    \ meeting space, meeting food and beverage\n      is affordable, within the norms\
    \ of business travel.\n   *  The Facility is accessible, or reasonable accommodations\
    \ can be\n      made to allow access, by people with disabilities.\n"

    \ meeting needs.\n   *  The Facility's support technologies and services -- network,\n\
    \      audio-video, etc. -- are sufficient for the anticipated activities\n  \
    \    at the meeting, or the Facility is willing to add such\n      infrastructure,\
    \ or these support technologies and services might\n      be provided by a third\

    \ for use as a\n      lounge, conducive to planned and ad hoc meetings and chatting,\
    \ as\n      well as a space for working online.  There are tables with\n     \
    \ seating, convenient for small meetings with laptops.  These can be\n      at\

    \ hotel chains in case such a\n      contract will reduce administrative costs,\
    \ reduce direct attendee\n      costs, or both.\n   *  When we are considering\
    \ a city for the first time, it is\n      particularly desirable to have someone\
    \ familiar with both the\n      locale and the IETF participate in the site visit.\
    \  Such a person\n      can provide guidance regarding safety, location of local\
