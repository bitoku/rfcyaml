- title: 3.1 PFR Scope
  contents:
  - "3.1 PFR Scope\n   A PFR contains a set of glyph shapes.  Each glyph shape is\
    \ associated\n   with a character code.  The PFR format is designed to be both\
    \ compact\n   and platform-independent.  It is intended to facilitate accurate\n\
    \   rendering of fonts in environments whether or not they have the\n   required\
    \ fonts already installed.\n   The glyph shape definitions in a PFR are resolution-independent.\n\
    \   This allows glyph definitions to be displayed or printed on devices\n   with\
    \ a wide variety of resolutions.  It also allows glyphs to be\n   rendered at\
    \ any size.\n"
- title: 3.2 PFR Features
  contents:
  - "3.2 PFR Features\n   Some of the features of the PFR format are:\n    - Compact\
    \ representation of glyph shapes\n    - Independent of byte order and operating\
    \ system\n    - Independent of output device resolution\n    - Fully scalable\
    \ to any glyph size\n    - Optional inclusion of bitmap glyph images\n    - Adopted\
    \ as the font standard by DAVIC, DVB, and DTG\n"

- title: 5. MIME Definition
  contents:
  - "5. MIME Definition\n   The PFR media type has been previously registered with\
    \ IANA as\n   application/vnd.truedoc.  In view of its subsequent widespread\n\
    \   adoption as a standard font format by multiple standards bodies who\n   have\
    \ relationships with the Internet community, Bitstream has been\n   asked to re-register\
    \ this media type within the IETF tree.\n"
- title: 6. IANA Registration
  contents:
  - "6. IANA Registration\n   To: ietf-types@iana.org\n   Subject: Registration of\
    \ Standard MIME Media type\n       application/font-tdpfr\n   MIME media type\
    \ name: application\n   MIME subtype name: font-tdpfr\n   Required parameters:\
    \ none\n   Optional parameters: none\n   Encoding considerations: Binary or base\
    \ 64 required\n   Security considerations:\n      PFR uses a structure that can\
    \ store glyph image data and encoding\n      arrays.  The fields defined in the\
    \ PFR specification are of a\n      descriptive nature and provide information\
    \ that is useful to\n      facilitate viewing and rendering of glyph images by\
    \ a recipient.\n      As such, the fields currently defined in the PFR specification\
    \ do\n      not in themselves create additional security risks, since the\n  \
    \    fields are not used to induce any particular behavior by the\n      recipient\
    \ application.\n      PFR has an extensible structure, so that it is theoretically\n\
    \      possible that fields could be defined in the future which could be\n  \
    \    used to induce particular actions on the part of the recipient,\n      thus\
    \ presenting additional security risks, but this type of\n      capability is\
    \ not supported in the referenced PFR specification.\n      Indeed, the definition\
    \ of fields that would include such\n      processing instructions is inconsistent\
    \ with the goals and spirit\n      of the PFR specification.\n   Interoperability\
