- title: 1.  Introduction and History
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction and History\n   There are a number of different methods by which\
    \ an RFC is published,\n   some of which include review in the Internet Engineering\
    \ Task Force\n   (IETF), and some of which include approval by the Internet\n\
    \   Engineering Steering Group (IESG):\n   o  IETF Working Group (WG) to Standards\
    \ Track: Includes WG consensus,\n      review in the IETF, IETF Last Call, and\
    \ IESG approval\n   o  IETF WG to Experimental/Informational: Includes WG consensus,\n\
    \      review in the IETF, and IESG approval\n   o  Area Director (AD) sponsored\
    \ to Standards Track: Includes review\n      in the IETF, IETF Last Call, and\
    \ IESG approval\n   o  AD Sponsored Individual to Experimental/Informational:\
    \ Includes\n      some form of review in the IETF and IESG approval\n   o  Documents\
    \ for which special rules exist\n   o  RFC Editor documents to Experimental/Informational\n\
    \   This memo is only concerned with the IESG processing of the last\n   category.\n\
    \   Special rules apply to some documents, including documents from the\n   Internet\
    \ Architecture Board (IAB), April 1st RFCs, and republication\n   of documents\
    \ from other standards development organizations.  The\n   IESG and the RFC Editor\
    \ keep a running dialogue, in consultation with\n   the IAB, on these other documents\
    \ and their classification, but they\n   are outside the scope of this memo.\n\
    \   For the last few years, the IESG has reviewed all RFC Editor\n   documents\
    \ (documents submitted by individuals to the RFC Editor for\n   RFC publication)\
    \ before publication.  In 2003, this review was often\n   a full-scale review\
    \ of technical content, with the ADs attempting to\n   clear points with the authors,\
    \ stimulate revisions of the documents,\n   encourage the authors to contact appropriate\
    \ working groups and so\n   on.  This was a considerable drain on the resources\
    \ of the IESG, and\n   since this is not the highest priority task of the IESG\
    \ members, it\n   often resulted in significant delays.\n   In March 2004, the\
    \ IESG decided to make a major change in this review\n   model.  The new review\
    \ model will have the IESG take responsibility\n   ONLY for checking for conflicts\
    \ between the work of the IETF and the\n   documents submitted; soliciting technical\
    \ review is deemed to be the\n   responsibility of the RFC Editor.  If an individual\
    \ IESG member\n   chooses to review the technical content of the document and\
    \ finds\n   issues, that member will communicate these issues to the RFC Editor,\n\
    \   and they will be treated the same way as comments on the documents\n   from\
    \ other sources.\n   Note: This document describes only the review process done\
    \ by the\n   IESG when the RFC Editor requests that review.  There are many other\n\
    \   interactions between document editors and the IESG for instance, an\n   AD\
    \ may suggest that an author submit a document as input for work\n   within the\
    \ IETF rather than to the RFC Editor, or the IESG may\n   suggest that a document\
    \ submitted to the IETF is better suited for\n   submission to the RFC Editor\
    \ but these interactions are not described\n   in this memo.\n"
- title: 2.  Background Material
  contents:
  - "2.  Background Material\n   The review of independent submissions by the IESG\
    \ was prescribed by\n   RFC 2026 [1] section 4.2.3.  The procedure described in\
    \ this document\n   is compatible with that description.\n   RFC 3710 [4] section\
    \ 5.2.2 describes the spring 2003 review process\n   (even though the RFC was\
    \ published in 2004); with the publication of\n   this document, the procedure\
    \ described in RFC 3710 is no longer\n   relevant to documents submitted via the\
    \ RFC Editor.\n"
- title: 3.  Detailed Description of IESG Review
  contents:
  - "3.  Detailed Description of IESG Review\n   The RFC Editor reviews submissions\
    \ for suitability for publications\n   as RFC.  Once the RFC Editor thinks a document\
    \ may be suited for RFC\n   publication, the RFC Editor asks the IESG to review\
    \ the documents for\n   conflicts with the IETF standards process or work done\
    \ in the IETF\n   community.\n   The review is initiated by a note from the RFC\
    \ Editor specifying the\n   document name, the RFC Editor's belief about the document's\
    \ present\n   suitability for publication, and (if possible) the list of people\
    \ who\n   have reviewed the document for the RFC Editor.\n   The IESG may return\
    \ five different responses, any of which may be\n   accompanied by an IESG note\
    \ to be put on the document if the RFC\n   Editor wishes to publish.\n   1. The\
    \ IESG has not found any conflict between this document and IETF\n      work.\n\
    \   2. The IESG thinks that this work is related to IETF work done in WG\n   \
    \   <X>, but this does not prevent publishing.\n   3. The IESG thinks that publication\
    \ is harmful to the IETF work done\n      in WG <X> and recommends not publishing\
    \ the document at this time.\n   4. The IESG thinks that this document violates\
    \ IETF procedures for\n      <X> and should therefore not be published without\
    \ IETF review and\n      IESG approval.\n   5. The IESG thinks that this document\
    \ extends an IETF protocol in a\n      way that requires IETF review and should\
    \ therefore not be\n      published without IETF review and IESG approval.\n \
    \  The last two responses are included respectively, for the case where\n   a\
    \ document attempts to take actions (such as registering a new URI\n   scheme)\
    \ that require IETF consensus or IESG approval (as these terms\n   are defined\
    \ in RFC 2434 [2]), and for the case where an IETF protocol\n   is proposed to\
    \ be changed or extended in an unanticipated way that\n   may be harmful to the\
    \ normal usage of the protocol, but where the\n   protocol documents do not explicitly\
    \ say that this type of extension\n   requires IETF review.\n   If a document\
    \ requires IETF review, the IESG will offer the author\n   the opportunity to\
    \ ask for publication as an AD-sponsored individual\n   document, which is subject\
    \ to full IESG review, including possible\n   assignment to a WG or rejection.\
    \  Redirection to the full IESG review\n   path is not a guarantee that the IESG\
    \ will accept the work item, or\n   even that the IESG will give it any particular\
    \ priority; it is a\n   guarantee that the IESG will consider the document.\n\
    \   The IESG will normally have review done within 4 weeks from the RFC\n   Editor's\
    \ notification.  In the case of a possible conflict, the IESG\n   may contact\
    \ a WG or a WG chair for an outside opinion of whether\n   publishing the document\
    \ is harmful to the work of the WG and, in the\n   case of a possible conflict\
    \ with an IANA registration procedure, the\n   IANA expert for that registry.\n\
    \   Note that if the IESG has not found any conflict between a submission\n  \
    \ and IETF work, then judging its technical merits, including\n   considerations\
    \ of possible harm to the Internet, will become the\n   responsibility of the\
    \ RFC Editor.  The IESG assumes that the RFC\n   Editor, in agreement with the\
    \ IAB, will manage mechanisms for\n   additional technical review.\n"
- title: 4.  Standard IESG Note
  contents:
  - "4.  Standard IESG Note\n   One of the following IESG notes will be sent to the\
    \ RFC Editor for\n   all documents, with a request for placement either in or\
    \ immediately\n   following the \"Status of this Memo\" section of the finished\
    \ RFC,\n   unless the IESG decides otherwise:\n   1. For documents that specify\
    \ a protocol or other technology, and\n      that have been considered in the\
    \ IETF at one time:\n      The content of this RFC was at one time considered\
    \ by the IETF,\n      and therefore it may resemble a current IETF work in progress\
    \ or a\n      published IETF work.  This RFC is not a candidate for any level\
    \ of\n      Internet Standard.  The IETF disclaims any knowledge of the\n    \
    \  fitness of this RFC for any purpose and in particular notes that\n      the\
    \ decision to publish is not based on IETF review for such\n      things as security,\
    \ congestion control, or inappropriate\n      interaction with deployed protocols.\
    \  The RFC Editor has chosen to\n      publish this document at its discretion.\
    \  Readers of this RFC\n      should exercise caution in evaluating its value\
    \ for implementation\n      and deployment.  See RFC 3932 for more information.\n\
    \   2. For documents that specify a protocol or similar technology and\n     \
    \ are independent of the IETF process:\n      This RFC is not a candidate for\
    \ any level of Internet Standard.\n      The IETF disclaims any knowledge of the\
    \ fitness of this RFC for\n      any purpose and in particular notes that the\
    \ decision to publish\n      is not based on IETF review for such things as security,\n\
    \      congestion control, or inappropriate interaction with deployed\n      protocols.\
    \  The RFC Editor has chosen to publish this document at\n      its discretion.\
    \  Readers of this document should exercise caution\n      in evaluating its value\
    \ for implementation and deployment.  See\n      RFC 3932 for more information.\n\
    \   3. For documents that do not specify a protocol or similar\n      technology:\n\
    \      This RFC is not a candidate for any level of Internet Standard.\n     \
    \ The IETF disclaims any knowledge of the fitness of this RFC for\n      any purpose\
    \ and notes that the decision to publish is not based on\n      IETF review apart\
    \ from IESG review for conflict with IETF work.\n      The RFC Editor has chosen\
    \ to publish this document at its\n      discretion.  See RFC 3932 for more information.\n"
- title: 5.  Examples of Cases Where Publication Is Harmful
  contents:
  - "5.  Examples of Cases Where Publication Is Harmful\n   This section gives a couple\
    \ of examples where delaying or preventing\n   publication of a document might\
    \ be appropriate due to conflict with\n   IETF work.  It forms part of the background\
    \ material, not a part of\n   the procedure.\n   Rejected Alternative Bypass:\
    \ A WG is working on a solution to a\n   problem, and a participant decides to\
    \ ask for publication of a\n   solution that the WG has rejected.  Publication\
    \ of the document will\n   give the publishing party an RFC number to refer to\
    \ before the WG is\n   finished.  It seems better to have the WG product published\
    \ first,\n   and have the non-adopted document published later, with a clear\n\
    \   disclaimer note saying that \"the IETF technology for this function is\n \
    \  X\".\n   Example: Photuris (RFC 2522), which was published after IKE (RFC\n\
    \   2409).\n   Inappropriate Reuse of \"free\" Bits: In 2003, a proposal for an\n\
    \   experimental RFC was published that wanted to reuse the high bits of\n   the\
    \ \"fragment offset\" part of the IP header for another purpose.  No\n   IANA\
    \ consideration says how these bits can be repurposed, but the\n   standard defines\
    \ a specific meaning for them.  The IESG concluded\n   that implementations of\
    \ this experiment risked causing hard-to-debug\n   interoperability problems and\
    \ recommended not publishing the document\n   in the RFC series.  The RFC Editor\
    \ accepted the recommendation.\n   Note: in general, the IESG has no problem with\
    \ rejected alternatives\n   being made available to the community; such publications\
    \ can be a\n   valuable contribution to the technical literature.  However, it\
    \ is\n   necessary to avoid confusion with the alternatives the working group\n\
    \   did adopt.\n   The RFC series is one of many available publication channels;\
    \ this\n   document takes no position on the question of which documents the RFC\n\
    \   series is appropriate for.  That is a matter for discussion in the\n   IETF\
    \ community.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  IAB Statement\n   In its capacity as the body that approves the general policy\
    \ followed\n   by the RFC Editor (see RFC 2850 [3]), the IAB has reviewed this\n\
    \   proposal and supports it as an operational change that is in line\n   with\
    \ the respective roles of the IESG and RFC Editor.  The IAB\n   continues to monitor\
    \ the range of organized discussions within the\n   IETF about potential adjustments\
    \ to the IETF document publication\n   processes (e.g., NEWTRK working group)\
    \ and recognizes that the\n   process described in this document, as well as other\
    \ general IETF\n   publication processes, may need to be adjusted in the light\
    \ of the\n   outcome of those discussions.\n"
