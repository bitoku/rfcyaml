  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) core specification\n
    \  [RFC4975] states that the MSRP User Agent (UA) that sends the Session\n   Description
    Protocol (SDP) offer is \"active\", and it is responsible\n   for creating the
    MSRP transport connection towards the remote UA if a\n   new connection is required.
    \ The core specification also allows, but\n   does not define, alternate mechanisms
    for MSRP UAs to create MSRP\n   transport connections.\n   [RFC4145] defines a
    connection-oriented media (COMEDIA) mechanism,\n   which endpoints can use to
    negotiate the endpoint that initiates the\n   creation of media transport connection.\n
    \  COMEDIA is especially useful when one of the endpoints is located\n   behind
    a Network Address Translator (NAT).  The endpoint can use the\n   mechanism to
    indicate that it will create the media transport\n   connection, in order for
    the media to traverse the NAT without the\n   usage of relays and without being
    required to support more complex\n   mechanisms (e.g., \"TCP Candidates with Interactive
    Connectivity\n   Establishment (ICE)\" [ICE-TCP]).  In addition, COMEDIA allows
    the\n   usage of identical procedures in establishing Transmission Control\n   Protocol
    (TCP) [RFC0793] connections for different types of media.\n   An example is the
    Open Mobile Alliance (OMA)-defined \"Instant Message\n   using SIMPLE\" [OMA-SIMPLE],
    where one MSRP UA of every MSRP transport\n   connection represents a media server,
    which is always located in the\n   carrier network.  The media server has a globally
    reachable IP\n   address and handles application-specific policy control as well
    as\n   NAT traversal.  The OMA IM (Instant Messenger) uses COMEDIA for NAT\n   traversal,
    and all OMA IM MSRP clients support COMEDIA.\n   This document defines how an
    MSRP UA uses COMEDIA in order to\n   negotiate which UA will create the MSRP transport
    TCP connection\n   towards the other UA.  The document also defines how an MSRP
    UA that\n   uses COMEDIA can establish an MSRP transport connection with a remote\n
    \  UA that does not support COMEDIA.\n"

        order to\n   negotiate which endpoint will create the MSRP transport connection\n
        \  towards the other UA.\n   An MSRP UA MUST always include an explicit a=setup
        attribute in its\n   SDP offers and answers, since it might be useful for
        the other\n   endpoint, or for entities in the network, to know whether the
        UA\n   supports COMEDIA or not.\n   An MSRP UA MUST support the a=setup \"active\",
        \"actpass\", and\n   \"passive\" attribute values.  An MSRP UA MUST NOT send
        the \"holdconn\"\n   attribute value.  If an MSRP UA receives the \"holdconn\"
        attribute\n   value, it MUST ignore it and process the message as if it did
        not\n   contain an a=setup attribute.\n"
      title: 4.2.1.  General
    - contents:
      - "4.2.2.  Attribute Usage\n   When the a=setup attribute value is \"actpass\"
        or \"passive\", the IP\n   address and port values in the MSRP URI of the
        SDP a=path attribute\n   MUST contain the actual address and port values on
        which the UA can\n   receive a TCP connection for the MSRP transport connection.\n
        \  In accordance with [RFC4145], if the a=setup attribute value is\n   \"active\",
        the port number value should be 9.\n   If an MSRP UA can provide a globally
        reachable IP address that the\n   other endpoint can use as a destination
        for a TCP connection, the UA\n   MUST use the a=setup \"actpass\" attribute
        value in SDP offers.  This\n   is in order to allow the remote UA to send
        an SDP answer with an\n   a=setup \"active\" attribute value if the UA is
        located behind a NAT,\n   and in order to be compatible with UAs that do not
        support COMEDIA\n   and thus always will act as passive endpoints.  If an
        MSRP UA cannot\n   provide the actual transport address, the UA MUST use the
        a=setup\n   \"active\" attribute value.\n   The UA MUST NOT use the a=setup
        \"passive\" attribute value in an SDP\n   offer.\n   The MSRP UA can determine
        that it provides a globally reachable IP\n   address in the following scenarios:\n
        \  o  the UA can determine that it is not located behind a NAT;\n   o  the
        UA relays its MSRP transport connections via a relay (e.g., an\n      MSRP
        relay or Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN) server); or\n   o  the UA has used
        Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)\n      [RFC5389] signaling to retrieve
        the NAT address and port through\n      the local port to be used for the
        eventual transport connection,\n      while also having determined that the
        NAT has endpoint-independent\n      mapping and filtering behavior [RFC5382],
        e.g., using the\n      mechanism defined in [RFC5780].\n   Some UAs can determine
        whether the SIP [RFC3261] signaling has\n   traversed a NAT by inspecting
        the SIP Via header field in the 200\n   (OK) response to the initial SIP REGISTER
        request, and comparing the\n   IP addresses in the Via sent-by and the received
        header field\n   parameters.  If the IP addresses are not the same, then the
        UA can\n   determine that there is a NAT in the path.  Even though the media\n
        \  transport might not traverse the NAT, it is safe to assume that it\n   will.
        \ This comparing mechanism does not work in all scenarios,\n   though.  For
        example, if SIP a request crosses a SIP proxy before\n   crossing a NAT, the
        UA will not be able to detect the NAT by\n   comparing the IP addresses.\n
        \  If an SDP offer includes an a=setup \"actpass\" attribute value, the\n
        \  SDP answerer MAY include an a=setup \"active\" attribute value in the\n
        \  SDP answer, but SHOULD include an a=setup \"passive\" attribute value\n
        \  if it knows that it is not located behind a NAT.\n   Once the active UA
        has established the MSRP transport connection, the\n   UA must immediately
        send an MSRP SEND request, as defined in\n   [RFC4975].\n      NOTE: According
        to [RFC4975], the initiating UA is always active,\n      but when COMEDIA
        is used, the a=setup attribute is used to\n      negotiate which UA becomes
        active.\n"

      \  Security (TLS), it MUST use the TLS mechanisms defined in [RFC4975]\n   and
      [RFC4976].\n   According to [RFC4975], the connection can be established with
      or\n   without TLS mutual authentication.  In case mutual authentication is\n
      \  not used, the listening device waits until it receives a request on\n   the
      connection, at which time it infers the identity of the\n   connecting device
      from the associated session description.  From the\n   TLS authentication point
      of view, it is thus irrelevant whether an\n   endpoint takes the active or passive
      role.\n   If an MSRP UA uses a self-signed TLS certificate to authenticate\n
      \  itself to MSRP peers, it also includes its certificate fingerprint in\n   the
      SDP.\n   Note that fingerprints can only be exchanged in peer-to-peer\n   communication,
      as MSRP relays [RFC4976] will not receive the SDP\n   payloads containing the
      fingerprint attributes.\n"

    UA conformant to this document can interoperate with a UA\n   that follows the

    to this document is located behind a NAT, does\n   not proxy its MSRP communication
    via an MSRP relay, and receives an\n   SDP offer from a remote UA that follows
    the connection model defined\n   in [RFC4975], then NAT traversal can only be
    achieved if the MSRP UA\n   supports ICE [ICE-TCP] or if the network supports
    Session Border\n   Controller (SBC)-assisted NAT traversal for TCP.\n"

- contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   According to the connection model defined in
    [RFC4975], the MSRP UA\n   that sends the SDP offer becomes the active party,
    and it is\n   responsible for creating the MSRP transport connection towards the\n
    \  remote UA if a new connection is required.\n   When COMEDIA is used, either
    the sender or the receiver of the SDP\n   offer can become the active party.  [RFC4975]
    requires that the\n   active party immediately issue an MSRP SEND request once
    the\n   connection has been established.  This allows the passive party to\n   bind
    the inbound TCP connection to the message session identified by\n   the session
    id part of its MSRP URI.  The use of COMEDIA does not\n   change this requirement,
    but the sender of the SDP offer is no longer\n   assumed to always become the
    active party.\n   The active party also takes the role of the TLS client, if TLS
    is\n   used to protect the MSRP messages.  However, there are no procedures\n
    \  in [RFC4975] that would break in case the receiver of the SDP offer\n   takes
    the role of the TLS client, and the level of security provided\n   by TLS is not
    affected.\n"
