    \ defining traps\n   used with the SNMP.  Readers should note that the use of\
    \ traps in the\n   Internet-standard network management framework is controversial.\
    \  As\n   such, this memo is being put forward for information purposes.\n   Network\
    \ management practitioners who employ traps are encouraged to\n   make use of\
    \ this document.  Practitioners who do not employ traps can\n   safely ignore\
    \ this document.\n   This memo provides information for the Internet community.\
    \  It does\n   not specify any standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n"

  - "1.  Historical Perspective\n   As reported in RFC 1052, IAB Recommendations for\
    \ the Development of\n   Internet Network Management Standards [1], a two-prong\
    \ strategy for\n   network management of TCP/IP-based internets was undertaken.\
    \  In the\n   short-term, the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), defined\
    \ in\n   RFC 1067, was to be used to manage nodes in the Internet community.\n\
    \   In the long-term, the use of the OSI network management framework was\n  \
    \ be examined.  Two documents were produced to define the management\n   information:\
    \ RFC 1065, which defined the Structure of Management\n   Information (SMI), and\
    \ RFC 1066, which defined the Management\n   Information Base (MIB).  Both of\
    \ these documents were designed so as\n   to be compatible with both the SNMP\
    \ and the OSI network management\n   framework.\n   This strategy was quite successful\
    \ in the short-term: Internet-based\n   network management technology was fielded,\
    \ by both the research and\n   commercial communities, within a few months.  As\
    \ a result of this,\n   portions of the Internet community became network manageable\
    \ in a\n   timely fashion.\n   As reported in RFC 1109, Report of the Second Ad\
    \ Hoc Network\n   Management Review Group [2], the requirements of the SNMP and\
    \ the OSI\n   network management frameworks were more different than anticipated.\n\
    \   As such, the requirement for compatibility between the SMI/MIB and\n   both\
    \ frameworks was suspended.  This action permitted the operational\n   network\
    \ management framework, based on the SNMP, to respond to new\n   operational needs\
    \ in the Internet community by producing MIB-II.\n   In May of 1990, the core\
    \ documents were elevated to \"Standard\n   Protocols\" with \"Recommended\" status.\
    \  As such, the Internet-standard\n   network management framework consists of:\
    \ Structure and\n   Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based\
    \ internets,\n   RFC 1155 [3], which describes how managed objects contained in\
    \ the\n   MIB are defined; Management Information Base for Network Management\n\
    \   of TCP/IP-based internets, which describes the managed objects\n   contained\
    \ in the MIB, RFC 1156 [4]; and, the Simple Network\n   Management Protocol, RFC\
    \ 1157 [5], which defines the protocol used to\n   manage these objects.\n"
- title: 2.  Defining Traps
  contents:
  - "2.  Defining Traps\n   Due to its initial requirement to be protocol-independent,\
    \ the\n   Internet-standard SMI does not provide a means for defining traps.\n\
    \   Instead, the SNMP defines a few standardized traps and provides a\n   means\
    \ for management enterprises to transmit enterprise-specific\n   traps.\n   However,\
    \ with the introduction of experimental MIBs, some of which\n   have a need to\
    \ define experiment-specific traps, a convenient means\n   of defining traps is\
    \ desirable.  The TRAP-TYPE macro is suggested for\n   this purpose:\n       \
    \   IMPORTS\n              ObjectName\n                  FROM RFC1155-SMI;\n \
    \         TRAP-TYPE MACRO ::=\n          BEGIN\n              TYPE NOTATION ::=\
    \ \"ENTERPRISE\" value\n                                    (enterprise OBJECT\
    \ IDENTIFIER)\n                                VarPart\n                     \
    \           DescrPart\n                                ReferPart\n           \
    \   VALUE NOTATION ::= value (VALUE INTEGER)\n              VarPart ::=\n    \
    \                     \"VARIABLES\" \"{\" VarTypes \"}\"\n                   \
    \           | empty\n              VarTypes ::=\n                         VarType\
    \ | VarTypes \",\" VarType\n              VarType ::=\n                      \
    \   value (vartype ObjectName)\n              DescrPart ::=\n                \
    \         \"DESCRIPTION\" value (description DisplayString)\n                \

    \ \"REFERENCE\" value (reference DisplayString)\n                            \
    \  | empty\n          END\n   It must be emphasized however, that the use of traps\
    \ is STRONGLY\n   discouraged in the Internet-standard Network Management Framework.\n\
    \   The TRAP-TYPE macro is intended to allow concise definitions of\n   existing\
    \ traps, not to spur the definition of new traps.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Mapping of the TRAP-TYPE macro\n   It should be noted that the expansion\
    \ of the TRAP-TYPE macro is\n   something which conceptually happens during implementation\
    \ and not\n   during run-time.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  Mapping of the ENTERPRISE clause
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Mapping of the ENTERPRISE clause\n   The ENTERPRISE clause, which must\
    \ be present, defines the management\n   enterprise under whose registration authority\
    \ this trap is defined\n   (for a discussion on delegation of registration authority,\
    \ see the\n   SMI [3]).  This value is placed inside the enterprise field of the\n\
    \   SNMP Trap-PDU.\n   By convention, if the value of the ENTERPRISE clause is\n\
    \                snmp   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { mib-2 11 }\n   as defined in MIB-II\
    \ [7], then instead of using this value, the value\n   of sysObjectID is placed\
    \ in the enterprise field of the SNMP Trap-\n   PDU.  This provides a simple means\
    \ of using the TRAP-TYPE macro to\n   represent the existing standard SNMP traps;\
    \ it is not intended to\n   provide a means to define additional standard SNMP\
    \ traps.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  Mapping of the VARIABLES clause
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Mapping of the VARIABLES clause\n   The VARIABLES clause, which need\
    \ not be present, defines the ordered\n   sequence of MIB objects which are contained\
    \ within every instance of\n   the trap type.  Each variable is placed, in order,\
    \ inside the\n   variable-bindings field of the SNMP Trap-PDU.  Note that at the\n\
    \   option of the agent, additional variables may follow in the\n   variable-bindings\
    \ field.\n   However, if the value of the ENTERPRISE clause is\n             \
    \  snmp   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { mib-2 11 }\n   as defined in MIB-II [7], then\
    \ the introduction of additional\n   variables must not result in the serialized\
    \ SNMP Message being larger\n   than 484 octets.\n"
- title: 2.1.3.  Mapping of the DESCRIPTION clause
  contents:
  - "2.1.3.  Mapping of the DESCRIPTION clause\n   The DESCRIPTION clause, which need\
    \ not be present, contains a textual\n   definition of the trap type.  Note that\
    \ in order to conform to the\n   ASN.1 syntax, the entire value of this clause\
    \ must be enclosed in\n   double quotation marks, although the value may be multi-line.\n\
    \   Further, note that if the MIB module does not contain a textual\n   description\
    \ of the trap elsewhere then the DESCRIPTION clause must be\n   present.\n"
- title: 2.1.4.  Mapping of the REFERENCE clause
  contents:
  - "2.1.4.  Mapping of the REFERENCE clause\n   The REFERENCE clause, which need\
    \ not be present, contains a textual\n   cross-reference to a trap, event, or\
    \ alarm, defined in some other MIB\n   module.  This is useful when de-osifying\
    \ a MIB produced by some other\n   organization.\n"
- title: 2.1.5.  Mapping of the TRAP-TYPE value
  contents:
  - "2.1.5.  Mapping of the TRAP-TYPE value\n   The value of an invocation of the\
    \ TRAP-TYPE macro is the (integer)\n   number which is uniquely assigned to the\
    \ trap by the registration\n   authority indicated by the ENTERPRISE clause. \
    \ This value is placed\n   inside the specific-trap field of the SNMP Trap-PDU,\
    \ and the\n   generic-trap field is set to \"enterpriseSpecific(6)\".\n   By convention,\
    \ if the value of the ENTERPRISE clause is\n               snmp   OBJECT IDENTIFIER\
    \ ::= { mib-2 11 }\n   as defined in MIB-II [7], then the value of an invocation\
    \ of the\n   TRAP-TYPE macro is placed inside the generic-trap field of the SNMP\n\
    \   Trap-PDU, and the specific-trap field is set to 0.  This provides a\n   simple\
    \ means of using the TRAP-TYPE macro to represent the existing\n   standard SNMP\
    \ traps; it is not intended to provide a means to define\n   additional standard\
