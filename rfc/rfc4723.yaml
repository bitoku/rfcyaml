  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA) and the Association of\n\
    \   Musical Electronics Industry (AMEI) have produced the Mobile XMF\n   standard,\
    \ which was developed particularly for mobile MIDI\n   applications.  Mobile XMF\
    \ is a very compact media type providing\n   high-quality synthetic audio content\
    \ for music downloading and\n   messaging applications that require MIME registration.\
    \  This document\n   registers the media type audio/mobile-xmf.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   MIDI content is used commonly in the Internet.  Typically,\
    \ MIDI data\n   is stored in the Standard MIDI File (SMF) format [8].  This MIME\
    \ type\n   registration uses the Mobile XMF file format for the encapsulation\
    \ of\n   SP-MIDI [3,4] and Mobile DLS (Downloadable Sounds) [2] data.\n   The\
    \ MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA) and the Association of\n   Musical Electronics\
    \ Industry (AMEI) have produced the Mobile XMF\n   standard [1], which was developed\
    \ particularly for mobile MIDI [7]\n   applications.\n"

    \   Required parameters: none\n   Optional parameters:\n      revision: Mobile\
    \ XMF file type revision ID\n         revision is the Mobile XMF file type revision\
    \ ID number from\n         the XmfFileTypeRevisionID field of the XMF Meta File\
    \ format\n         2.00. revision is encoded in hex in US-ASCII.\n      prl: Playback\
    \ resource list\n         prl contains the playback resources included in all\
    \ Content\n         Description MetaDataItems of the Mobile XMF file.  prl contains\n\
    \         two-digit hexadecimal numbers representing data bytes from the\n   \
    \      Content Description Meta Data.  Each resource is listed exactly\n     \
    \    once.  A playback resource contains two parts: a prefix and\n         data.\
    \  prl is a sequence of two-digit hexadecimal numbers\n         encoded in US-ASCII.\
    \  Thus, prl has an even number of\n         hexadecimal digits.\n         Example:\
    \ If the file includes Playback Resource Lists such as\n         [00h 01h 00h\
    \ 02h] and [00h 01h 00h 03h], the corresponding prl\n         is 000100020003\
    \ containing playback resources 01, 02, and 03\n         each with the prefix\
    \ 00.\n      minimum-pr: Minimum playback requirements\n         minimum-pr contains\
    \ the Maximum Instantaneous Resource (MIR)\n         values from the first row\
    \ of all MIR Count Tables corresponding\n         to the playback resources listed\
    \ in prl.  Only the largest\n         value from the values of the same resource\
    \ is chosen.\n         minimum-prl is a sequence of two-digit hexadecimal numbers\n\
    \         encoded in US-ASCII.  Thus, minimum-prl has an even number of\n    \
    \     hexadecimal digits.\n         minimum-pr requires the use of prl, and the\
    \ values in\n         minimum-pr must be in the same order as the resources in\
    \ prl.\n         minimum-pr is the more important of minimum-pr and total-pr,\n\
    \         because it defines the minimum playback requirements.\n         Example:\
    \ If the file includes the first rows of MIR Count\n         Tables such as [02h\
    \ 00h] and [01h 01h] corresponding to the\n         above Playback Resource Lists,\
    \ the corresponding minimum-pr is\n         020001.  (02 is the largest of 2 and\
    \ 1, 00 is the largest of 0,\n         and 01 is the largest of 1.)\n      total-pr:\
    \ Total playback requirements\n         total-pr contains the MIR values from\
    \ the last row of all MIR\n         Count Tables corresponding to the playback\
    \ resources listed in\n         prl.  Only the largest value from the values of\
    \ the same\n         resource is chosen.  total-pr is a sequence of two-digit\n\
    \         hexadecimal numbers encoded in US-ASCII.  Thus, total-pr has an\n  \
    \       even number of hexadecimal digits.\n         total-pr requires the use\
    \ of prl, and the values in total-pr\n         must be in the same order as the\
    \ resources in prl.\n         Example: If the file includes the last rows of MIR\
    \ Count Tables\n         such as [05h 02h] and [06h 01h] corresponding to the\
    \ above\n         Playback Resource Lists, the corresponding total-pr is 060201.\n\
    \         (06 is the largest of 5 and 6, 02 is the largest of 2, and 01\n    \
    \     is the largest of 1.)\n   Encoding considerations:\n      mobile-xmf data\
    \ is binary data and must be encoded for non-binary\n      transport; Base64 [9]\
    \ is suitable for Email.\n   Security considerations:\n      Many synthetic audio\
    \ compositions have associated intellectual\n      property rights.  It is conceivable\
    \ that the rights owners of\n      mobile-xmf content will want to protect their\
    \ rights by applying\n      security mechanisms that prohibit the rendering of\
    \ the content\n      without a legally acquired license to do so.  These mechanisms\n\
    \      would be applied externally to the Content-Type defined here;\n      mobile-xmf\
    \ content itself is not encrypted internally.  mobile-xmf\n      streams do not\
    \ contain executable content.  Mobile XMF players are\n      robust against corrupted\
    \ mobile-xmf content, because Mobile XMF\n      players ignore unidentified content.\
    \  prl, minimum-pr, and\n      total-pr parameters can be used to represent Mobile\
    \ DLS playback\n      memory requirements for protecting against the excessive\
    \ usage of\n      playback memory.\n   Interoperability considerations:\n    \
    \  Mobile XMF is a Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)\n      specification\
    \ developed by MMA and AMEI.  Mobile XMF is based on\n      the XMF Meta File\
    \ Format Specification v2.00 [5,6], which\n      standardizes a meta file format\
    \ for the electronic distribution of\n      music.  mobile-xmf data is stored\
    \ in XMF file format [5,6].\n   Published specification:\n      Mobile XMF Content\

    \   Applications which use this media type:\n      mobile-xmf is a synthetic audio\
    \ format for the flexible\n      presentation of SP-MIDI and Mobile DLS instrument\
