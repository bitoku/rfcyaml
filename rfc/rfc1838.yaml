- title: 1.  X.400/RFC 822 Mappings
  contents:
  - "1.  X.400/RFC 822 Mappings\n   RFC 1327 defines an algorithm for maintaining\
    \ a global mapping\n   between X.400 and RFC 822 addresses directory [2].  RFC\
    \ 1327 also\n   defines a table based mechanism for maintaining this mapping.\
    \  There\n   is substantial benefit to maintaining this mapping within the\n \
    \  directory.  In particular, this will lead to an approach for managing\n   the\
    \ mapping which is both distributed and scalable.\n   Mechanisms for representing\
    \ O/R Address and Domain hierarchies within\n   the DIT are defined in [1, 5].\
    \  These techniques are used to define\n   two independent subtrees in the DIT,\
    \ which contain the mapping\n   information.  The benefits of this approach are:\n\
    \   1.  The mapping information is kept in a clearly defined area which\n    \
    \   can be widely replicated in an efficient manner.  The tree is\n       constrained\
    \ to hold only information needed to support the\n       mapping.  This is important\
    \ as gateways need good access to the\n       entire mapping.\n   2.  It facilitates\
    \ migration from the currently deployed table-based\n       approach.\n   3. \
    \ It handles the issues of \"missing components\" in a natural\n       manner.\n\
    \          An alternative approach which is not taken is to locate the\n     \
    \     information in the routing subtrees.  The benefits of this\n          would\
    \ be:\n        o  It is the \"natural\" location, and will also help to\n    \
    \       ensure correct administrative authority for a mapping\n           definition.\n\
    \        o  The tree will usually be accessed for routing, and so it\n       \
    \    will be efficient for addresses which are being routed.\n          This is\
    \ not done, as the benefits of the approach proposed\n          are greater.\n\
    \   There are three mappings, which are represented by two subtrees\n   located\
    \ under:\n   OU=X.400/RFC 822 Mapping,  O=Internet\n   These subtree roots are\
    \ of object class subtree, and use the\n   mechanism for representing subtrees\
    \ defined in [4].\n   X.400 to RFC 822 This table gives the equivalence mapping\
    \ from X.400\n       to RFC 822.  There is an O/R Address tree under this.  An\
    \ example\n       entry is:\n       PRMD=UK.AC, ADMD=Gold 400, C=GB, CN=X.400\
    \ to RFC 822,\n       OU=X.400/RFC 822 Mapping,  O=Internet\n   RFC 822 to X.400\
    \ There is a domain tree under this.  This table holds\n       the equivalence\
    \ mapping from RFC 822 to X.400, and the gateway\n       mapping defined in RFC\
    \ 1327.  An example entry is:\n       DomainComponent=ISODE, DomainComponent=COM,\n\
    \       CN=RFC 822 to X.400,\n       OU=X.400/RFC 822 Mapping,  O=Internet\n \
    \  The values of the table mapping are defined by use of two new object\n   classes,\
    \ as specified in Figure 1.  The objects give pointers to the\n   mapped components.\n"
- title: 2.  Omitted Components
  contents:
  - "2.  Omitted Components\n   In RFC 1327, it is possible to have omitted components\
    \ in O/R\n   Addresses on either side of the mapping.  A mechanism to represent\n\
    \   such omitted components is defined in Figure 2.\n   The attribute at-or-address-component-type\
    \ is set to the X.500\n   attribute type associated with the omitted component\
    \ (e.g., at-prmd-\n   name).  This mechanism is for use only within the X.400\
    \ to RFC 822\n   subtree and for the at-associated-or-address attribute.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Mapping from X.400 to RFC 822\n   As an example, consider the mapping from\
    \ the O/R Address:\n   P=UK.AC; A=Gold 400; C=GB\n   This would be keyed by the\
    \ directory entry:\n   PRMD=UK.AC, ADMD=Gold 400, C=GB, CN=X.400 to RFC 822,\n\
    \   OU=X.400/RFC 822 Mapping,  O=Internet\n   and return the mapping from the\
    \ associatedDomain attribute, which\n   gives the domain which this O/R address\
    \ maps to.  This attribute is\n   used to define authoritative mappings, which\
    \ are placed in the open\n   community tree.  The manager of an RFC 1327 mapping\
    \ shall make the\n   appropriate entry.\n   Functionally, mapping takes place\
    \ exactly according to RFC 1327.  The\n   longest match is found by the following\
    \ algorithm.\n   1.  Take the O/R Address, and derive a directory name.  This\
    \ will be\n       the O/R Address as far as the lowest OU.\n   2.  Look up the\
    \ entire name derived from the RFC 1327 key in the in\n       the X.400 to RFC\
    \ 822 subtree.  This lookup will either succeed,\n       or it will fail and indicate\
    \ the longest possible match, which\n       can then be looked up.\n   3.  Check\
    \ for an associatedDomain attribute in the matched entry.\n   The mapping can\
    \ always be achieved with two lookups.\n   Because of the availability of aliases,\
    \ some of the table mappings\n   may be simplified.  In addition, the directory\
    \ can support mapping\n   from addresses using the numeric country codes.\n"
- title: 4.  Mapping from RFC 822 to X.400
  contents:
  - "4.  Mapping from RFC 822 to X.400\n   There is an analogous structure for mappings\
    \ in the reverse\n   direction.  The domain hierarchy is represented in the DIT\
    \ according\n   to RFC 1279.  The domain:\n   AC.UK\n   Is represented in the\
    \ DIT as:\n   DomainComponent=AC, DomainComponent=UK,  CN=RFC 822 to X.400,\n\
    \   OU=X.400/RFC 822 Mapping,  O=Internet\n   This has associated with it the\
    \ attribute associatedORAddress encoded\n   as a distinguished name with a value:\n\
    \   PRMD=UK.AC, ADMD=Gold 400, C=GB\n   The \"table 3\" mapping defined in RFC\
    \ 1327 [2] is provided by the\n   associatedX400Gateway attribute.  This value\
    \ may identify multiple\n   possible associated gateways.  This information is\
    \ looked up at the\n   same time as mapped O/R addresses.  In effect, this provides\
    \ a\n   fallback mapping, which is found if there is no equivalence mapping.\n\
    \   Because of the nature of the mapping a domain will map to either a\n   gateway\
    \ or a domain, but not both.  Thus, there shall never be both\n   an associatedX400Gateway\
    \ and associatedORAddress attribute present in\n   the same entry.  Functionally,\
    \ mapping takes place exactly according\n   to RFC 1327.  The longest match is\
    \ found by the following algorithm.\n   1.  Derive a directory name from the domain\
    \ part of the RFC 822\n       address.\n   2.  Look up this name in the RFC 822\
    \ to X.400 subtree to find the\n       mapped value (either associatedORAddress\
    \ or\n       associatedX400Gateway.).  If the lookup fails, the error will\n \
    \      indicate the longest match, which can then be looked up.\n   If associatedORAddress\
    \ is found, this will define the mapped O/R\n   Address.  The mapping can always\
    \ be achieved with two lookups.  If an\n   associatedX400Gateway is present, the\
    \ address in question will be\n   encoded as a domain defined attribute, relative\
    \ to the O/R Address\n   defined by this attribute.  If multiple associatedX400Gateway\n\
    \   attributes are found, the MTA may select the one it chooses to use.\n   Because\
    \ of the availability of aliases, some of the table mappings\n   may be simplified.\
    \  In addition, the directory can support mapping\n   from addresses using the\
    \ numeric country codes.\n"
