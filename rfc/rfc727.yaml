  - "4.  Motivation for the option.\n   Often, a runaway user process could be hung\
    \ in such a state that it\n   cannot be interrupted by normal means.  Conversely,\
    \ the system itself\n   could be bottlenecked so that response delays are intolerable.\
    \  A\n   user (human or otherwise) eventually will time out out of frustration\n"

    \ to free itself\n   from the hung process.  In some situations, even the simple\
    \ operation\n   of logging out can take a long time.\n   Some systems treat a\
    \ close to mean that it should log out its user\n   process under it.  However,\
    \ many hosts merely \"detach\" the process so\n   that an accidental close due\
    \ to a user or temporary hardware error\n   will not cause all work done on that\
    \ job to be lost; when the\n   connection is re-established, the user may \"attach\"\
    \ back to its\n   process.  While this protection is often valuable, if the user\
    \ is\n   giving up completely on the host, it can cause this hung job to\n   continue\
    \ to load the system.\n   This option allows a process to instruct the server\
    \ that the user\n   process at the server's end should be forcibly logged out\
    \ instead of\n   detached.  A secondary usage of this option might be for a server\
    \ to\n   warn of impending auto-logout of its user process due to inactivity.\n"

  - "5.  Description of the option.\n   When a user decides that it no longer wants\
    \ its process on the server\n   host and decides that it does not want to wait\
    \ until the host's\n   normal log out protocol has been gone through, it sends\
    \ IAC DO\n   LOGOUT.  The receiver of the command may respond with IAC WILL\n\
    \   LOGOUT, in which case it will then forcibly log off the user process\n   at\
    \ its end.  If it responds with IAC WON'T LOGOUT, then it indicates\n   that it\
    \ has not logged off the user process at its end, and if the\n   connection is\
    \ broken, the process very possibly will be detached.\n   A truly impatient user\
    \ that feels that it must break away from the\n   server immediately could even\
    \ send IAC DO LOGOUT and then close. At\n   the worst, the server would only ignore\
    \ the request and detach the\n   user process.  A server that implements the LOGOUT\
    \ option should know\n   to log out the user process despite the sudden close\
    \ and even an\n   inability to confirm the LOGOUT request!\n"

  - "6.  A sample implementation of the option.\n   The server implements the LOGOUT\
    \ option both for accepting LOGOUT\n   requests and for auto-logout warning.\n\
    \   Case 1:\n      The user connects to the server, and starts interacting with\
    \ the\n      server.  For some reason, the user wishes to terminate interaction\n\
    \      with the server, and is reluctant to go through the normal log out\n  \
    \    procedure, or perhaps the user is unable to go through the normal\n"

    \ at the server any\n      more, so it sends IAC DO LOGOUT.  The server verifies\
    \ the request\n      with IAC WILL LOGOUT, and then forcibly logs off the user\
    \ process\n      (perhaps by using a system call that causes another process to\
    \ be\n      logged out).  It does not have to close the connection unless the\n\
    \      user closes or it wants to close.  Neither does it wait until the\n   \
    \   user has received its confirmation--it starts the log out\n      immediately\
    \ so if the user has in the mean time closed the\n      connection without waiting\
    \ for confirmation, its logout request\n      still is performed.\n   Case 2:\n\
    \      The user connects to the server, and after logging in, is idle for\n  \
    \    a while, long enough to approach the server's autologout time.\n      The\
    \ server shortly before the autologout sends IAC WILL LOGOUT;\n      the user\
    \ sees this and sends IAC DON'T LOGOUT, and continues work\n      on the host.\
    \  Nothing prevents the server from logging out the\n      user process if inactivity\
    \ continues; this can be used to prevent\n      a malicious user from locking\
    \ up a process on the server host by\n      the simple expedient of sending IAC\
    \ DON'T LOGOUT every time it\n      sees IAC WILL LOGOUT but doing nothing else.\n"
