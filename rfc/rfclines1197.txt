Overview ODA is a recently approved ISO (8613) and CCITT (T.410) standard for representing documents containing multifont text, raster images and geometric graphics.
This encoding has been specified for use in a number of related standards, such as X.400.
However, ODA is a very abstract standard, defining entities such as "composite logical object classes" and not common entities, such as "paragraphs".
Therefore, effective use of ODA as an interchange medium requires the definition of a document application profile (dap) that defines some common entities and a map between ODA entities defined in the dap and entities used in the interchanged systems.
The National Science Foundation funded the EXPRES project, which consisted of groups at Carnegie Mellon University (Information Technology Center) and the University of Michigan (Center for Information Technology Integration).
These two groups collaborated with groups at McDonnell Douglas Aerospace Information Systems, NIST, and Interleaf.
Together, the five groups investigated the use of ODA as an interchange medium for submitting research proposals by electronic mail to the National Science Foundation.
Part of the investigations yielded strategies for using ODA.
We based our strategies on the NIST dap and the features provided by the Andrew, Diamond, and Interleaf systems.
Our experiences been documented and published in a book [1].
The discussion may be valuable for others who wish to use ODA as an interchange medium.
