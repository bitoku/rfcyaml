  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB) is an industry-led\n\
    \   consortium of over 270 broadcasters, manufacturers, network\n   operators,\
    \ software developers, regulatory bodies and others in over\n   35 countries committed\
    \ to designing global standards for the global\n   delivery of digital television\
    \ and data services.  Services using DVB\n   standards are available on every\
    \ continent with a total of more than\n   100 million DVB receivers already deployed.\n\
    \   DVB would like to assign unique, permanent, location-independent\n   names\
    \ based on URNs for some resources it produces or manages.  These\n   URNs will\
    \ be constructed according to the URN syntax defined in\n   [RFC2141].\n   This\
    \ namespace specification is for a formal namespace to be\n   registered according\

- title: 4.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Namespace Considerations\n   The urn:dvb namespace is used to identify metadata\
    \ that is defined by\n   DVB and describes DVB multimedia and interactive services.\
    \  The\n   registration of urn:dvb as a formal namespace enables the use and\n\
    \   referencing of DVB XML fragments in other standards worldwide and\n   enables\
    \ those standards to leverage and build upon publicly available\n   DVB metadata\
    \ schemas and fragments.\n   These URNs are used to refer to, in conjunction with,\
    \ and as part of\n   commercial or public multimedia broadcast services.  In most\
    \ markets,\n   these are under the control of a national regulator.  So if a\n\
    \   particular market chooses to use DVB services, in general, the\n   regulator\
    \ imposes compliance with the relevant DVB specifications to\n   ensure interoperability\
    \ and open competition in the marketplace.\n   URN assignment procedures:\n  \
    \    The individual URNs shall be assigned through the process of\n      development\
    \ of DVB standards by the Digital Video Broadcasting\n      Project (DVB).  The\
    \ latest information about DVB defined metadata\n      can always be found at\
    \ the owner's website at:\n      http://www.dvb.org/metadata\n   URN resolution/delegation:\n\
    \      The resolution and delegation shall be determined through the\n      process\
    \ of development of DVB standards by the Digital Video\n      Broadcasting Project\
    \ (DVB).\n      Since the implementations envisaged cover a wide range of devices\n\
    \      with quite different access methods and capabilities, no single\n     \
    \ resolution or delegation mechanism can be referenced in this\n      document.\n\
    \      Currently, 2 client system classes are covered by DVB\n      specifications:\n\
    \       o  A broadcast set-top box that only has a unidirectional,\n         \
    \ receive-only connection.  Hence, all DVB URNs need to be\n          resolvable\
    \ from the service discovery information received in\n          the broadcast\
    \ stream.\n       o  A \"home network end device\" (HNED) that could be an IPTV\
    \ set-\n          top box, networked TV, or personal digital recorder with an\n\
    \          Ethernet or Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) connection to a\n  \
    \        home gateway device.\n      Further device classes will be addressed\
    \ as DVB standardization\n      progresses.  The urn:dvb URNs must however remain\
    \ valid.  DVB will\n      define appropriate resolution/delegation mechanisms\
    \ to ensure that\n      DVB URNs remain valid for those new device classes as\
    \ well.\n      For the two above example device classes, 3 ways of conveying such\n\
    \      resolution information are currently defined by DVB:\n      o  Repeated,\
    \ cyclic transmission of Resolution Authority Records\n         (RAR) and Resolution\
    \ Records (RR) as auxiliary data in digital\n         TV broadcast streams over\
    \ satellite, cable, or terrestrial\n         transmissions according to [EN300468],\
    \ [EN301192], and\n         [TS102323].\n      o  Repeated, cyclic multicast transmission\
    \ of Resolution Records\n         (RR) via the DVBSTP protocol according to [TS102034].\n\
    \      o  Unicast delivery of Resolution Records (RR) in response to HTTP\n  \
    \       \"GET /dvb/sdns\" requests according to [TS102034].\n   Type of resources\
    \ to be identified:\n      Types of resources to be identified include XML schema\
    \ definition\n      files, classification schemes, and identification systems\
    \ defined\n      and openly published by DVB.  These resources being identified\n\
    \      constitute a metadata system to describe digital multimedia\n      broadcast\
    \ services or content conveyed as part of such services.\n      The latest DVB\
    \ defined metadata can always be found at:\n      http://www.dvb.org/metadata\n\
    \      These metadata definitions are not entirely usable without\n      knowledge\
    \ of the DVB specifications listed in the Normative\n      References section.\
    \  To make them generally useful for client\n      platforms typically found in\
    \ computer network environments today,\n      XSLT transformations to HTML, or\
    \ other common formats would be\n      needed to enable rendering in a standard\
    \ web browser.  On the\n      other hand, it is expected that with the increasing\
    \ overlap\n      between the computer and multimedia worlds - e.g., with the\n\
    \      forthcoming DVB file format definition - DVB metadata formats will\n  \
    \    get adopted in player implementations on PC platforms as well.\n   Type of\
    \ services to be supported:\n      Types of services supported include controlled\
    \ term lookup in\n      classification schemes and resolution of ids in identification\n\
    \      systems.\n      Concrete examples of these services include digital television\n\
    \      services, (near) video on-demand services, and digital radio sound\n  \
    \    services.  Another example is interactive multimedia applications\n     \
    \ which are tied to audiovisual content.\n      This might, e.g., be a quiz show\
    \ where viewers can compete against\n      the contestants on the show by picking\
    \ multiple-choice answers\n      with their remote control.  These end-user services\
    \ are enabled by\n      the metadata defined under the urn:dvb namespace.\n  \
    \    Another example is the web-portal site for the video-on-demand\n      offering\
    \ of an ISP.  The portal pages are likely to describe the\n      content in terms\
    \ of title, genre, parental guidance, cast, etc.\n      The ISP might either publish\
    \ the DVB format description on their\n      web-portal site directly, or develop\
    \ an XSLT transformation to\n      obtain an HTML incarnation of the data.  In\
    \ either case, a client\n      device (in this example the home gateway or the\
    \ ISP's web portal)\n      will need to be able to resolve references to the urn:dvb\n\
    \      namespace.  Describing multimedia content in DVB format is a\n      likely\
    \ choice since it provides rich information specially\n      tailored to multimedia\
    \ applications like television, movies,\n      music, etc.  Furthermore, the DVB\
    \ content descriptions for\n      consumer terminals are, of course, compatible\
    \ with the DVB\n      Portable Content Format (PCF, defined in ETSI TS 102 523),\
    \ which\n      is used in content production environments so that propagation\
    \ of\n      content descriptions along the entire production chain is easily\n\
    \      achieved.\n"

  - "5.  Community Considerations\n   With the digitization of the audiovisual broadcasting\
    \ technologies,\n   television receiver platforms have become quite similar to\
    \ personal\n   computer equipment in terms of performance, resources, and\n  \
    \ interfaces.  Hence, cross-use of content from the respective other\n   platform\
    \ (i.e., TV and PC) becomes interesting to consumers and\n   service providers\
    \ alike.  Web pages can for instance today be viewed\n   on a general purpose\
    \ computer, a set-top box, and a mobile phone just\n   the same.  Audio/video\
    \ broadcasting services are arriving on mobile\n   phones today (\"mobile TV\"\
    ), and efforts are clearly visible to bring\n   such services to personal computer\
    \ platforms as well (\"IPTV\").\n   Hence, cross-linking between these two domains,\
    \ the Internet/personal\n   computer domain and the TV/broadcast domain is called\
    \ for.  Linking\n   from broadcast domain metadata to Internet-based services\
    \ is already\n   enabled through the various URN and URI schemes established in\
    \ the\n   relevant DVB standards ([EN300468], [TS102323], and [TS102034]).\n \
    \  Linking from Internet/web resources to DVB multimedia services is not\n   yet\
    \ possible in a well-defined way.  Thus, a URN scheme is proposed\n   for DVB\
    \ defined metadata describing DVB services.  As DVB issues its\n   publications\
    \ as international standards and has a well-defined\n   compliance regime, this\
    \ request is for a formal namespace.\n   Open assignment and use of identifiers\
    \ within the namespace:\n      With on-going development of DVB standards, DVB\
    \ will establish\n      requirements for assignment and use of identifiers within\
    \ the DVB\n      namespace.  Current identifier assignments can be inferred from\n\
    \      the relevant DVB standards and from http://www.dvb.org/metadata.\n   Considerations\
    \ for resolution server software:\n      With on-going development of DVB standards,\
    \ DVB will establish\n      requirements and seek candidates for operating resolution\
    \ servers\n      as appropriate.\n      Sources for resolution information can\
    \ either be stand-alone\n      resolution services, which are announced as part\
    \ of the Service\n      Discovery and Selection (SD&S), or data conveyed as part\
    \ of the\n      SD&S information itself.  To boot-strap the resolution process,\
    \ a\n      DVB client hence needs to discover an entry point (or set of) from\n\
    \      which to obtain an initial Service Discovery and Selection XML\n      record.\n\
    \      By default, the actual service discovery information is provided\n    \
    \  on the IANA registered well-known port dvbservdsc (port number\n      3937)\
    \ via tcp and udp (see http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-\n      numbers) on\
    \ the IANA registered well-known multicast addresses\n      224.0.23.14 (DvbServDisc\
    \ on IPv4) and FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:0:12D\n      (DvbServDisc on IPv6).\n      As set\
    \ forth in [TS102034], a list of non-default Service\n      Discovery and Selection\
    \ (SD&S) entry points addresses may also be\n      provided via DNS based on the\
    \ service location resource record\n      (SRV RR) [RFC2782].  The service name\
    \ for DVB services is\n      \"_dvbservdsc\", the protocol may be tcp or udp,\
    \ while the rest of\n      the name is the domain name maintained by DVB for service\n\
    \      discovery.  This domain name is set to \"services.dvb.org\".  The\n   \
    \   DVB organization will maintain the services.dvb.org domain name\n      for\
    \ service discovery, and new service providers should register\n      with DVB\
    \ to add them to the DNS SRV list.\n   Considerations for resolution client software:\n\
    \      With on-going development of DVB standards, DVB members will\n      develop\
    \ software implementations of its standards for various\n      platforms.  Today,\
    \ these platforms typically include Open Source-\n      based platforms such as\
    \ Linux.\n      To resolve a urn:dvb name, a client needs to retrieve Service\n\
    \      Discovery and Selection (SD&S) data since this either directly\n      contains\
    \ resolution data, or lists stand-alone resolution services\n      from which\
    \ Resolution Authority Records (RAR) can be retrieved.\n      To obtain the initial\
    \ Service Discovery and Selection (SD&S) XML\n      record, a client must by default\
    \ first join the IANA registered\n      well-known multicast addresses 224.0.23.14\
    \ (DvbServDisc on IPv4)\n      and/or FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:0:12D (DvbServDisc on IPv6)\
    \ and try to\n      obtain a boot-strap record from the IANA registered well-known\n\
    \      port dvbservdsc (port number 3937) via tcp and udp (see\n      http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers).\n\
    \      To discover non-default entry points addresses, [TS102034] defines\n  \
    \    that a list of Service Discovery and Selection (SD&S) entry points\n    \
    \  addresses may be acquired via DNS according to the service\n      location\
    \ resource record (SRV RR) [RFC2782].  The service name is\n      \"_dvbservdsc\"\
    ; the protocol may be tcp or udp, while the rest of\n      the name is the domain\
    \ name maintained by DVB for service\n      discovery.  This domain name is set\
    \ to \"services.dvb.org\".  So the\n      lookup shall be either \"_dvbservdsc._tcp.services.dvb.org\"\
    \ or\n      \"_dvbservdsc._udp.services.dvb.org\".  This requires that the\n \
    \     terminal support an SRV cognizant DNS client and in a way\n      according\
    \ to the specification in [RFC2782].  The DVB organization\n      will maintain\
    \ the services.dvb.org domain name for service\n      discovery.  HTTP servers\
    \ will be found via the tcp protocol method\n      whilst the multicast addresses\
    \ will be found via the udp protocol\n      method.\n"
