- title: 1. Overview
  contents:
  - "1. Overview\n   This document defines a Resource ReSerVation Protocol-Traffic\n\
    \   Engineering (RSVP-TE) protocol addition to support ATM (Asynchronous\n   Transfer\
    \ Mode) Service Class-aware MPLS (MultiProtocol Label\n   Switching) Traffic Engineering.\n\
    \   This protocol addition is used with all MPLS Label Switched Routers\n   (LSRs)\
    \ and link types (including, but not restricted to, Packet over\n   SONET, Ethernet,\
    \ and ATM links) to signal traffic engineered paths\n   that can support the ATM\
    \ service classes as defined by the ATM Forum\n   [TM].  This document does not\
    \ specify HOW to actually implement the\n   functionality in the MPLS LSRs to\
    \ emulate the ATM Forum service\n   classes (such as necessary queuing and scheduling\
    \ mechanisms), only\n   how to signal that the TE path must support the ATM Forum\
    \ service\n   classes.  A useful application for such paths is the carriage of\
    \ ATM\n   cells encapsulated in IP or MPLS packets in order to use MPLS\n   networks\
    \ as functional replacements for ATM networks.\n"
- title: 2. Extended RSVP-TE Path Message Format
  contents:
  - "2. Extended RSVP-TE Path Message Format\n   One new RSVP-TE Object is defined\
    \ in this document: the\n   ATM_SERVICECLASS Object.  Detailed description of\
    \ this Object is\n   provided below.  This new Object is applicable to PATH messages.\n\
    \   This specification only defines the use of the ATM_SERVICECLASS\n   Object\
    \ in PATH messages used to establish LSP (Label Switched Path)\n   Tunnels in\
    \ accordance with [RSVP-TE].  Such PATH messages contain a\n   Session Object\
    \ with a C-Type equal to LSP_TUNNEL_IPv4 and a\n   LABEL_REQUEST object.\n   Restrictions\
    \ defined in [RSVP-TE] for support of establishment of LSP\n   Tunnels via RSVP-TE\
    \ are also applicable to the establishment of LSP\n   Tunnels supporting ATM Service\
    \ Class-aware traffic engineering.  For\n   instance, only unicast LSPs are supported\
    \ and Multicast LSPs are for\n   further study.\n   This new ATM_SERVICECLASS\
    \ object is optional with respect to RSVP-TE\n   so that general RSVP-TE implementations\
    \ not concerned with ATM\n   Service Class-aware traffic engineering MPLS LSP\
    \ setup do not have to\n   support this object.\n"

- title: 4. Handling the ATM_SERVICECLASS Object
  contents:
  - "4. Handling the ATM_SERVICECLASS Object\n   To establish an LSP tunnel with RSVP-TE,\
    \ the sender LSR creates a\n   PATH message with a session type of LSP_Tunnel_IPv4\
    \ and with a\n   LABEL_REQUEST object as per [RSVP-TE].  The sender LSR may also\n\
    \   include the DIFFSERV object as per [DIFF-MPLS].\n   If the LSP is associated\
    \ with an ATM Service Class, the sender LSR\n   must include the ATM_SERVICECLASS\
    \ object in the PATH message with the\n   Service-Class (SC) field set to signify\
    \ the desired ATM Service\n   Class.\n   If a path message contains multiple ATM_SERVICECLASS\
    \ objects, only\n   the first one is meaningful; subsequent ATM_SERVICECLASS object(s)\n\
    \   must be ignored and must not be forwarded.\n   Each LSR along the path that\
    \ is ATM_SERVICECLASS-aware records the\n   ATM_SERVICECLASS object, when present,\
    \ in its path state block.\n   The destination LSR responds to the PATH message\
    \ by sending a RESV\n   message without an ATM_SERVICECLASS object (whether the\
    \ PATH message\n   contained an ATM_SERVICECLASS object or not).\n"
- title: 5. Non-support of the ATM_SERVICECLASS Object
  contents:
  - "5. Non-support of the ATM_SERVICECLASS Object\n   An LSR that does not recognize\
    \ the ATM_SERVICECLASS object Class\n   Number must behave in accordance with\
    \ the procedures specified in\n   [RSVP] for an unknown Class Number with the\
    \ binary format 11bbbbbb,\n   where b=0 or 1 (i.e., RSVP will ignore the object\
    \ but forward it\n   unexamined and unmodified).\n   An LSR that recognizes the\
    \ ATM_SERVICECLASS object Class Number but\n   does not recognize the ATM_SERVICECLASS\
    \ object C-Type, must behave in\n   accordance with the procedures specified in\
    \ [RSVP] for an unknown\n   C-type (i.e., it must send a PathErr with the error\
    \ code 'Unknown\n   object C-Type' toward the sender).\n   In both situations,\
    \ this causes the path setup to fail.  The sender\n   should notify management\
    \ that a LSP cannot be established and\n   possibly might take action to retry\
    \ reservation establishment without\n   the ATM_SERVICECLASS object.\n"
- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   The solution is not expected to add specific security\
    \ requirements\n   beyond those of Diff-Serv and existing TE.  The security mechanisms\n\
    \   currently used with Diff-Serv and existing TE can be used with this\n   solution.\n"
