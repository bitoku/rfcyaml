- title: 1. Status of this Memo
  contents:
  - "1. Status of this Memo\n   This memo proposes a standard for SMTP on the virtual\
    \ circuit\n   facility provided by the X.25 standard of the CCITT.\n   Distribution\
    \ of this memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: 2. Introduction
  contents:
  - "2. Introduction\n   The possibility of using the X.25 virtual circuit (ISO level\
    \ 3)\n   directly for SMTP is mentioned in RFC 821 (\"SIMPLE MAIL TRANSPORT\n\
    \   PROTOCOL\"), in appendix D.  It suggests that \"a reliable end-to-end\n  \
    \ protocol such as TCP be used on top of X.25 connections\".  This was\n   undoubtedly\
    \ true considering the general reliability of the PSDNs at\n   the time (1981).\
    \  The service is now (in 1989) reliable enough to\n   allow practical direct\
    \ use of the virtual circuit service.\n   The procedures given here have proven\
    \ to be successful in extensive\n   production use, involving 24 PSDNs in 22 different\
    \ countries.  The\n   resulting service is economical even using some of the more\
    \ expensive\n   PSDNs.  Operation over private X.25 connections and X.25 LANs\
    \ has\n   also proven successful.\n   An X.25 virtual circuit (VC) is opened for\
    \ each SMTP session.  The\n   full duplex channel provided by the VC is used for\
    \ the session.  The\n   VC is then closed, normally by the calling side.\n"
- title: 3. Protocol ID and Call User Data
  contents:
  - "3. Protocol ID and Call User Data\n   The first four octets (bytes) of the Call\
    \ User Data Field, which are\n   commonly used as a protocol identifier, or PRID,\
    \ should be (hex)\n   C0F70000.  (In decimal, 192 247 0 0.)\n   Implementations\
    \ should, however, provide the ability to configure the\n   call user data on\
    \ a per-address basis, including the protocol ID\n   field.\n"
- title: 4. Data stream
  contents:
  - "4. Data stream\n   The SMTP data is divided into (streamed into) packets in any\
    \ way the\n   sending side prefers.  Sequences with the M bit (more data) set\
    \ are\n   encouraged, and may be up to 2048 bytes in total length.\n   It is recommended\
    \ that SMTP commands and responses be sent as single\n   packets, or single more-data\
    \ sequences, if only to facilitate\n   debugging the protocol.  This is not a\
    \ requirement.\n"
- title: 5. Qualified data
  contents:
  - "5. Qualified data\n   Packets with the Q bit set and interrupt packets are not\
    \ used, and\n   should be ignored if received.\n"
- title: 6. Circuit resets
  contents:
  - "6. Circuit resets\n   If a level 3 circuit reset is received, the VC should be\
    \ cleared, and\n   the SMTP connection attempted again.  The retry may be after\
    \ some\n   delay, and may be with different call facilities.\n"
- title: 7. Call facilities
  contents:
  - "7. Call facilities\n   Any negotiable features selected by the X.25 call request\
    \ facilities\n   field may be used.  Implementations should provide the ability\
    \ to\n   specify facilities for each called address.\n"
- title: 8. Character code
  contents:
  - "8. Character code\n   The character code used on X.25 is the full ASCII-8 code,\
    \ with no\n   escapes or modifications.  Lines are terminated by CRLF (13 10\n\
    \   decimal).  Implementations should, if possible, recognize lines\n   terminated\
    \ only by LF (10 decimal).\n"
- title: 9. Closing the connection
  contents:
  - "9. Closing the connection\n   Unlike TCP, X.25 does not provide for synchronous\
    \ delivery of data in\n   transit when a clear request is in progress; any packets\
    \ in transit\n   are discarded when the VC is cleared.  Therefore, on X.25, the\
    \ SMTP\n   session layer is closed by the calling side when the Service Closing\n\
    \   message is received, either in response to a QUIT command, or because\n  \
    \ the service must shut down.\n"
- title: 10. Timeouts
  contents:
  - "10. Timeouts\n   SMTP does not normally provide for timing out a session.  On\
    \ X.25,\n   the following has proven to be effective:\n      10.1. call request\n\
    \         If a call accept is not received within 100 seconds, or the\n      \
    \   Service Ready message is not received within (another) 120\n         seconds,\
    \ the call should be cleared and retried later.\n      10.2. established\n   \
    \      After the protocol session is established, the circuit should\n       \
    \  be cleared if no response is received for 10 minutes.\n      10.3. closing\n\
    \         After the QUIT command is issued, the timeout should be\n         shortened\
    \ to 20 seconds.  This will sometimes cause an\n         ungraceful exit, but\
    \ this will not affect the SMTP transactions\n         already completed.\n  \
    \    10.4. clearing\n         When the X.25 Clear Request packet has been sent,\
    \ the VC should\n         be timed out in accordance with the X.25 protocol\n\
    \         specification.\n      11. Other features\n         Other features of\
    \ X.25, such as permanent virtual circuits and\n         D bit selection, are\
    \ not used.\n"
