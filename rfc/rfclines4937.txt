Abstract This document describes the IANA considerations for the PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) protocol.
This document provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) regarding the registration of values related to the PPP over Ethernet Protocol (PPPoE), defined in [RFC2516], in accordance with BCP 26, [RFC2434].
TAG values as well as PPPoE packet Code fields, which are or have been in use on the Internet.
The following terms are used here with the meanings defined in BCP 26:  "name space", "registration".
The following policies are used here with the meanings defined in BCP 26: "First Come First Served".
In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements of the specification.
These words are often capitalized.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
The PPPoE protocol, as defined in [RFC2516], defines two name spaces that require registration, the PPPoE TAG and the PPPoE Code field.
TAG Values IANA has set up a registry of "PPPoE TAG Values".
These are 16 bit values.
TAG values already in use are specified as reserved in this document.
All other TAG values between 0 and 65535 are to be assigned by IANA, using the "First Come First Served" policy defined in [RFC2434].
A TAG Name and a description for the usage, as well as a point of contact, MUST be provided for any assignment from this registry.
A document reference SHOULD also be provided.
Service Name Error    See the reference
Code Fields IANA has set up a registry of PPPoE Active Discovery Code fields.
These are 8 bit values.
Code fields already in use are specified as reserved in this document.
All other Code values between 0 and 255 are to be assigned by IANA, using the "First Come First Served" policy defined in [RFC2434].
Active Discovery packet name and a description for the usage, as well as a point of contact, MUST be provided for any assignment from this registry.
A document reference SHOULD also be provided.
PADC, Session Credit Response  See the reference  [RFC4938]
This document focuses on IANA considerations for the PPPoE protocol, and as such, should help remove the possibility of the same PPPoE code field and PPPoE
TAG value being used for different functionalities.
