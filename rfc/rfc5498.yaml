- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document enumerates several common IANA allocations\
    \ for use by\n   one or more protocols that conform to [RFC5444].  The following\n\
    \   well-known numbers are required: a UDP port number, an IP protocol\n   number,\
    \ and a link-local multicast group address.  All interoperable\n   protocols running\
    \ on these well-known IANA allocations MUST conform\n   to [RFC5444].  [RFC5444]\
    \ provides a common format that enables one or\n   more protocols to share the\
    \ IANA allocations defined in this document\n   unambiguously.\n"

- title: 5.  Link-Local Multicast Group for MANET Routers
  contents:
  - "5.  Link-Local Multicast Group for MANET Routers\n   MANET routers require a\

    \ routing protocol packets.  The\n   name of the multicast address to reach link-local\
    \ (LL) MANET routers\n   is \"LL-MANET-Routers\".\n   For IPv4, a well-known,\
    \ link-local scope multicast address is\n   required.  The address for LL-MANET-Routers\
    \ is 224.0.0.109.\n   For IPv6, a well-known, link-local scope multicast address\
    \ is\n   required.  The address for LL-MANET-Routers is FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:6D.\n"

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This document specifies only well-known numbers\
    \ for protocols that\n   conform to [RFC5444], and it not does not specify the\
    \ protocols that\n   carry the information across the network.  Each protocol\
    \ using these\n   well-known numbers may have its own set of security issues,\
    \ but those\n   issues are not affected by using the IANA allocations specified\n\
    \   herein.\n   The security issues associated with possibly operating multiple\n\
    \   cooperating protocols using the same IANA assignments (e.g., UDP\n   port)\
    \ MUST be addressed in each protocol's specification.\n"
