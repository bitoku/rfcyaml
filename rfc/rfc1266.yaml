- title: 4. Documentation.
  contents:
  - "4. Documentation.\n   BGP is an inter-autonomous system routing protocol designed\
    \ for the\n   TCP/IP internets.  Version 1 of the BGP protocol was published in\
    \ RFC\n   1105. Since then BGP Versions 2 and 3 have been developed. Version 2\n\
    \   was documented in RFC 1163. Version 3 is documented in [3]. The\n   changes\
    \ between versions 1, 2 and 3 are explained in Appendix 3 of\n   [3].  Most of\
    \ the functionality that was present in the Version 1 is\n   present in the Version\
    \ 2 and 3.  Changes between Version 1 and\n   Version 2 affect mostly the format\
    \ of the BGP messages.  Changes\n   between Version 2 and Version 3 are quite\
    \ minor.\n   BGP Version 2 removed from the protocol the concept of \"up\", \"\
    down\",\n   and \"horizontal\" relations between autonomous systems that were\n\
    \   present in the Version 1.  BGP Version 2 introduced the concept of\n   path\
    \ attributes.  In addition, BGP Version 2 clarified parts of the\n   protocol\
    \ that were \"underspecified\".  BGP Version 3 lifted some of\n   the restrictions\
    \ on the use of the NEXT_HOP path attribute, and added\n   the BGP Identifier\
    \ field to the BGP OPEN message. It also clarifies\n   the procedure for distributing\
    \ BGP routes between the BGP speakers\n   within an autonomous system.  Possible\
    \ applications of BGP in the\n   Internet are documented in [2].\n   The BGP protocol\
    \ was developed by the IWG/BGP Working Group of the\n   Internet Engineering Task\
    \ Force. This Working Group has a mailing\n   list, iwg@rice.edu, where discussions\
    \ of protocol features and\n   operation are held. The IWG/BGP Working Group meets\
    \ regularly during\n   the quarterly Internet Engineering Task Force conferences.\
    \ Reports of\n   these meetings are published in the IETF's Proceedings.\n"

  - "6. Security architecture.\n   BGP provides flexible and extendible mechanism\
    \ for authentication and\n   security. The mechanism allows to support schemes\
    \ with various degree\n   of complexity. All BGP sessions are authenticated based\
    \ on the BGP\n   Identifier of a peer. In addition, all BGP sessions are authenticated\n\
    \   based on the autonomous system number advertised by a peer. As part\n   of\
    \ the BGP authentication mechanism, the protocol allows to carry\n   encrypted\
    \ digital signature in every BGP message. All authentication\n   failures result\
    \ in sending the NOTIFICATION messages and immediate\n   termination of the BGP\
    \ connection.\n   Since BGP runs over TCP and IP, BGP's authentication scheme\
    \ may be\n   augmented by any authentication or security mechanism provided by\n\
    \   either TCP or IP.\n"
- title: 7. Implementations.
  contents:
  - "7. Implementations.\n   There are multiple interoperable implementations of BGP\
    \ currently\n   available. This section gives a brief overview of the three\n\
    \   completely independent implementations that are currently used in the\n  \
    \ operational Internet. They are:\n      - cisco. This implementation was wholly\
    \ developed by cisco.\n        It runs on the proprietary operating system used\
    \ by the\n        cisco routers. Consult Kirk Lougheed (lougheed@cisco.com)\n\
    \        for more details.\n      - \"gated\". This implementation was developed\
    \ wholly by Jeff\n        Honig (jch@risci.cit.cornell.edu) and Dennis Ferguson\n\
    \        (dennis@CAnet.CA).  It runs on a variety of operating systems\n     \
    \   (4.3 BSD, AIX, etc...).  It is the only available public domain\n        code\
    \ for BGP. Consult Jeff Honig or Dennis Ferguson for more\n        details.\n\
    \      - NSFNET. This implementation was developed wholly by Yakov\n        Rekhter\
    \ (yakov@watson.ibm.com). It runs on the T1 NSFNET\n        Backbone and T3 NSFNET\
    \ Backbone. Consult Yakov Rekhter for\n        more details.\n   To facilitate\
    \ efficient BGP implementations, and avoid commonly made\n   mistakes, the implementation\
    \ experience with BGP in \"gated\" was\n   documented as part of RFC 1164.  Implementors\
    \ are strongly encouraged\n   to follow the implementation suggestions outlined\
    \ in that document.\n   Experience with implementing BGP showed that the protocol\
    \ is\n   relatively simple to implement. On the average BGP implementation\n \
    \  takes about 1 man/month effort.\n   Note that, as required by the IAB/IESG\
    \ for Draft Standard status,\n   there are multiple interoperable completely independent\n\
    \   implementations, namely those from cisco, \"gated\", and IBM.\n"
- title: 8. Operational experience.
  contents:
  - "8. Operational experience.\n   This section discusses operational experience\
    \ with BGP.\n   BGP has been used in the production environment since 1989.  This\
    \ use\n   involves all three implementations listed above.  Production use of\n\
    \   BGP includes utilization of all significant features of the protocol.\n  \
    \ The present production environment, where BGP is used as the inter-\n   autonomous\
    \ system routing protocol, is highly heterogeneous.  In\n   terms of the link\
    \ bandwidth it varies from 56 Kbits/sec to 45\n   Mbits/sec. In terms of the actual\
    \ routes that run BGP it ranges from\n   a relatively slow performance PC/RT to\
    \ a very high performance\n   RS/6000, and includes both the special purpose routers\
    \ (cisco) and\n   the general purpose workstations running UNIX. In terms of the\
    \ actual\n   topologies it varies from a very sparse (spanning tree or a ring\
    \ of\n   CA*Net) to a quite dense (T1 or T3 NSFNET Backbones).\n   At the time\
    \ of this writing BGP is used as an inter-autonomous system\n   routing protocol\
    \ between the following autonomous systems: CA*Net, T1\n   NSFNET Backbone, T3\
    \ NSFNET Backbone, T3 NSFNET Test Network, CICNET,\n   MERIT, and PSC. Within\
    \ CA*Net there are 10 border routers\n   participating in BGP. Within T1 NSFNET\
    \ Backbone there are 20 border\n   routers participating in BGP. Within T3 NSFNET\
    \ Backbone there are 15\n   border routers participating in BGP. Within T3 NSFNET\
    \ Test Network\n   there are 7 border routers participating in BGP. Within CICNET\
    \ there\n   are 2 border routers participating in BGP. Within MERIT there is 1\n\
    \   border router participating in BGP. Within PSC there is 1 router\n   participating\
    \ in BGP. All together there are 56 border routers\n   spanning 7 autonomous systems\
    \ that are running BGP.  Out of these, 49\n   border routers that span 6 autonomous\
    \ systems are part of the\n   operational Internet.\n   BGP is used both for the\
    \ exchange of routing information between a\n   transit and a stub autonomous\
    \ system, and for the exchange of routing\n   information between multiple transit\
    \ autonomous systems. It covers\n   both the Backbones (CA*Net, T1 NSFNET Backbone,\
    \ T3 NSFNET Backbone),\n   and the Regional Networks (PSC, MERIT).\n   Within\
    \ CA*Net, T3 NSFNET Backbone, and T3 NSFNET Test Network BGP is\n   used as the\
    \ exclusive carrier of the exterior routing information\n   both between the autonomous\
    \ systems that correspond to the above\n   networks, and with the autonomous system\
    \ of each network. At the time\n   of this writing within the T1 NSFNET Backbone\
    \ BGP is used together\n   with the NSFNET Backbone Interior Routing Protocol\
    \ to carry the\n   exterior routing information. T1 NSFNET Backbone is in the\
    \ process of\n   moving toward carrying the exterior routing information exclusively\n\
    \   by BGP.  The full set of exterior routes that is carried by BGP is\n   well\
    \ over 2,000 networks.\n   Operational experience described above involved multi-vendor\n\
    \   deployment (cisco, \"gated\", and NSFNET).\n   Specific details of the operational\
    \ experience with BGP in the NSFNET\n   were presented at the Twentieth IETF meeting\
    \ (March 11-15, 1991, St.\n   Louis) by Susan Hares (MERIT/NSFNET).  Specific\
    \ details of the\n   operational experience with BGP in the CA*Net were presented\
    \ at the\n   Twentieth IETF meeting (March 11-15, 1991, St. Louis) by Dennis\n\
    \   Ferguson (University of Toronto).  Both of these presentations are\n   available\
    \ in the IETF Proceedings.\n   Operational experience with BGP exercised all basic\
    \ features of the\n   protocol, including the authentication and routing loop\
    \ suppression.\n   Bandwidth consumed by BGP has been measured at the interconnection\n\
    \   points between CA*Net and T1 NSFNET Backbone. The results of these\n   measurements\
    \ were presented by Dennis Ferguson during the last IETF,\n   and are available\
    \ from the IETF Proceedings. These results showed\n   clear superiority of BGP\
    \ as compared with EGP in the area of\n   bandwidth consumed by the protocol.\
    \ Observations on the CA*Net by\n   Dennis Ferguson, and on the T1 NSFNET Backbone\
    \ by Susan Hares\n   confirmed clear superiority of BGP as compared with EGP in\
    \ the area\n   of CPU requirements.\n"

  - "9.1. Introduction.\n   On multiple occasions some members of IETF expressed concern\
    \ about\n   using TCP as a transport protocol for BGP. In this section we examine\n\
    \   the use of TCP for BGP in terms of:\n      - real versus perceived problems\n\
    \      - offer potential solutions to real problems\n      - perspective on the\

    \ Extensive operational\n   experience with BGP in the Internet showed that indeed\
    \ the use of the\n   incremental updates allows significant saving both in terms\
    \ of the\n   CPU utilization and bandwidth consumption.  However, to operate\n\
    \   correctly the incremental updates must be exchanged over a reliable\n   transport.\
    \  BGP uses TCP as such transport. It had been suggested\n   that another transport\
    \ protocol would be more suitable for BGP.\n"
- title: 9.2. Examination of Problems - Real and "perceived".
  contents:
  - "9.2. Examination of Problems - Real and \"perceived\".\n   Extensive operational\
    \ experience with BGP in the Internet showed that\n   the only real problem that\
    \ was attributed to BGP in general, and the\n   use of TCP as the transport for\
    \ BGP in particular, was its slow\n   convergence in presence of congestion. \
    \ This problem was experienced\n   in CA*Net. As we mentioned before, CA*Net is\
    \ composed of 10 routers\n   that form a ring. The routers are connected by 56\
    \ Kbits/sec links.\n   All links are heavily utilized and are often congested.\
    \  Experience\n   with BGP in CA*Net showed that unless special measures are taken,\
    \ the\n   protocol may exhibit slow convergence when BGP information is passed\n\
    \   over the slow speed (56 Kbits/sec) congested links. This is because a\n  \
    \ large percentage of packets carrying BGP information are being\n   dropped due\
    \ to congestion.  Therefore, there are three inter-related\n   problems: congestion,\
    \ packet drops, and the resulting slow\n   convergence of routing under congestion\
    \ and packet drops.\n   Observe, that any transport protocol used by BGP would\
    \ have\n   difficulty preventing packets from being dropped under congestion,\n\
    \   since it has no direct control over the routers that drop the\n   packets,\
    \ and the congestion has nothing to do with the BGP traffic.\n   Therefore, since\
    \ BGP is not the cause of congestion, and cannot\n   directly influence dropping\
    \ at the routers, replacing TCP (as the BGP\n   transport) with another transport\
    \ protocol would have no effect on\n   packets being dropped due to congestion.\
    \ We think that once a network\n   is congested, packets will be dropped (regardless\
    \ of whether these\n   packets carry BGP or any other information), unless special\
    \ measures\n   outside of BGP in general, and the transport protocol used by BGP\
    \ in\n   particular, are taken.\n   If packets carrying routing information are\
    \ lost, any distributed\n   routing protocol will exhibit slow convergence.  If\
    \ quick convergence\n   is viewed as important for a routing within a network,\
    \ special\n   measures to minimize the loss of packets that carry routing\n  \
    \ information must be taken.  The next section suggests some possible\n   methods.\n"
- title: 9.3. Solutions to the problem.
  contents:
  - "9.3. Solutions to the problem.\n   Two possible measures could be taken to reduce\
    \ the drop of BGP\n   packets which slows convergence of routing:\n      1) alleviate\
    \ the congestion\n      2) reduce the percentage of BGP packets that are dropped\
    \ due\n         to congestion by marking BGP packets and setting policies to\n\
    \         routers to try not to drop BGP packets\n   Alleviating the network congestion\
    \ is a subject outside the control\n   of BGP, and will not be discussed in this\
    \ paper.\n   Operational experience with BGP in CA*Net shows that reducing the\n\
    \   percentage of BGP packets dropped due to congestion by marking them,\n   and\
    \ setting policies to routers to try not to drop BGP packets\n   completely solves\
    \ the problem of slow convergence in presence of\n   congestion.\n   The BGP packets\
    \ can be marked (explicitly or implicitly) by the\n   following three methods:\n\
    \      a) by means of IP precedence (Internetwork Control)\n      b) by using\
    \ a well-known TCP port number\n      c) by identifying packets by just source\
    \ or destination IP\n         address.\n   Appendix 4 of the BGP protocol specification,\
    \ RFC 1163, recommends\n   the use of IP precedence (Internetwork Control) because\
    \ the\n   precedence provides a well-defined mechanism to mark BGP packets.\n\
    \   The method of a well-known TCP port number to identify packets is\n   similar\
    \ to the one that was used by Dave Mills in the NSFNET Phase I.\n   Dave Mills\
    \ identified Telnet traffic by a well known TCP port number,\n   and gave it priority\
    \ over the rest of the traffic.  CA*Net identified\n   BGP traffic based on it's\
    \ source and destination IP address.  Packets\n   receive a priority if either\
    \ the source or the destination IP address\n   belongs to CA*Net.\n   If packets\
    \ that carry the routing information are being dropped\n   (because of congestion),\
    \ one also may ask about how does a particular\n   routing protocol react to such\
    \ an event.  In the case of BGP the\n   packets are retransmitted using the TCP\
    \ retransmission mechanism. It\n   seems plausible that being more aggressive\
    \ in terms of the\n   retransmission should have positive effect on the convergence.\
    \  This\n   can be done completely within TCP by adjusting the TCP retransmission\n\
    \   timers. However, we would like to point out that the change in the\n   retransmission\
    \ strategy should not be viewed as a cure for the\n   problem, since the root\
    \ of the problem lies in the way how packets\n   that carry the BGP information\
    \ are handled within a congested\n   network, and not in how frequently the lost\
    \ packets are\n   retransmitted.\n   It should also be pointed out that the local\
    \ system can control the\n   amount of data to be retransmitted (in case of a\
    \ congestion or\n   losses) by adjusting the TCP Window size. That allows to control\
    \ the\n   amount of potentially obsolete data that has to be retransmitted.\n"
- title: 9.4. Perspective on the Convergence Problem.
  contents:
  - "9.4. Perspective on the Convergence Problem.\n   To put the convergence problem\
    \ in a proper perspective, we'd like to\n   point out that much of the Internet\
    \ now uses EGP at AS borders,\n   ensuring that routing changes cannot be guaranteed\
    \ to propagate\n   between ASes in less than a few minutes. It would take huge\
    \ amount of\n   congestion to slow BGP to this pace. Additionally, the problems\
    \ of\n   EGP in the face of packet loss are well known and far exceed any\n  \
    \ imaginable problem BGP/TCP might ever suffer.  Therefore, the worst\n   case\
    \ behavior of BGP is about the same as the steady case behavior of\n   EGP.\n\
    \   Within an AS the speed of convergence of the AS's IGP in the face of\n   congestion\
    \ is of far greater concern than the propagation speed of\n   BGP, and indeed\
    \ avoiding loss of packets carrying IGP, and a more\n   aggressive transport is\
    \ similarly of much greater importance for an\n   IGP than for BGP.\n   The issue\
    \ of BGP convergence is of exaggerated importance to CA*Net\n   since CA*Net carries\
    \ no information about external routes in its IGP.\n   CA*Net uses BGP to transfer\
    \ external routes for use in computing\n   internal routes through the CA*Net\
    \ network.  The reason CA*Net does\n   this has nothing to do with BGP. Under\
    \ more ordinary circumstances an\n   IGP carries external routing information\
    \ for use in computing\n   internal routes. CA*Net shows that BGP can work under\
    \ extreme stress.\n   However, it's results should not be taken as the norm since\
    \ most\n   networks will use BGP in a different (and less stressful)\n   configuration,\
    \ where information about external routes will be\n   carried by an IGP.\n"
- title: 9.5. Conclusion.
  contents:
  - "9.5. Conclusion.\n   The extensive operational experience with BGP showed that\
    \ the only\n   problem attributed to BGP was the slow convergence problem in\n\
    \   presence of congestion.  We demonstrated that this problem has\n   nothing\
    \ to do with BGP in general, or with TCP as the BGP transport\n   in particular,\
    \ but is directly related to the way how packets that\n   carry routing information\
    \ are handled within a congested network. The\n   document suggests possible ways\
    \ of solving the problem.  We would\n   like to point out that the issue of convergence\
    \ in presence of\n   congested network is important to all distributed routing\
    \ protocol,\n   and not just to BGP.  Therefore, we recommend that every routing\n\
    \   protocol (whether it is intra-autonomous system or inter-autonomous\n   system)\
    \ should clearly specify how its behavior is affected by the\n   congestion in\
    \ the networks, and what are the possible mechanisms to\n   avoid the negative\
    \ effect of congestion (if any).\n"
