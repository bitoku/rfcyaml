- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a new DNS resource record, called the DNSSEC\n\
    \   Lookaside Validation (DLV) RR, for publishing DNSSEC trust anchors\n   outside\
    \ of the DNS delegation chain.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   DNSSEC [1] [2] [3] authenticates DNS data by building public-key\n\
    \   signature chains along the DNS delegation chain from a trust anchor,\n   ideally\
    \ a trust anchor for the DNS root.\n   This document defines a new resource record\
    \ for publishing such trust\n   anchors outside of the DNS's normal delegation\
    \ chain.  Use of these\n   records by DNSSEC validators is outside the scope of\
    \ this document,\n   but it is expected that these records will help resolvers\
    \ validate\n   DNSSEC-signed data from zones whose ancestors either aren't signed\
    \ or\n   refuse to publish delegation signer (DS) records for their children.\n"
- title: 2.  DLV Resource Record
  contents:
  - "2.  DLV Resource Record\n   The DLV resource record has exactly the same wire\
    \ and presentation\n   formats as the DS resource record, defined in RFC 4034,\
    \ Section 5.\n   It uses the same IANA-assigned values in the algorithm and digest\n\
    \   type fields as the DS record.  (Those IANA registries are known as\n   the\
    \ \"DNS Security Algorithm Numbers\" and \"DS RR Type Algorithm\n   Numbers\"\
    \ registries.)\n   The DLV record is a normal DNS record type without any special\n\
    \   processing requirements.  In particular, the DLV record does not\n   inherit\
    \ any of the special processing or handling requirements of the\n   DS record\
    \ type (described in Section 3.1.4.1 of RFC 4035).  Unlike\n   the DS record,\
    \ the DLV record may not appear on the parent's side of\n   a zone cut.  A DLV\
    \ record may, however, appear at the apex of a zone.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   For authoritative servers and resolvers that\
    \ do not attempt to use\n   DLV RRs as part of DNSSEC validation, there are no\
    \ particular\n   security concerns -- DLV RRs are just like any other DNS data.\n\
    \   Software using DLV RRs as part of DNSSEC validation will almost\n   certainly\
    \ want to impose constraints on their use, but those\n   constraints are best\
    \ left to be described by the documents that more\n   fully describe the particulars\
    \ of how the records are used.  At a\n   minimum, it would be unwise to use the\
    \ records without some sort of\n   cryptographic authentication.  More likely\
    \ than not, DNSSEC itself\n   will be used to authenticate the DLV RRs.  Depending\
    \ on how a DLV RR\n   is used, failure to properly authenticate it could lead\
    \ to\n   significant additional security problems including failure to detect\n\
    \   spoofed DNS data.\n   RFC 4034, Section 8, describes security considerations\
    \ specific to\n   the DS RR.  Those considerations are equally applicable to DLV\
    \ RRs.\n   Of particular note, the key tag field is used to help select DNSKEY\n\
    \   RRs efficiently, but it does not uniquely identify a single DNSKEY\n   RR.\
    \  It is possible for two distinct DNSKEY RRs to have the same\n   owner name,\
    \ the same algorithm type, and the same key tag.  An\n   implementation that uses\
    \ only the key tag to select a DNSKEY RR might\n   select the wrong public key\
    \ in some circumstances.\n   For further discussion of the security implications\
    \ of DNSSEC, see\n   RFC 4033, RFC 4034, and RFC 4035.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has assigned DNS type code 32769 to the DLV\
    \ resource record from\n   the Specification Required portion of the DNS Resource\
    \ Record Type\n   registry, as defined in [4].\n   The DLV resource record reuses\
    \ the same algorithm and digest type\n   registries already used for the DS resource\
    \ record, currently known\n   as the \"DNS Security Algorithm Numbers\" and \"\
    DS RR Type Algorithm\n   Numbers\" registries.\n"
