  title: Status of This Memo
- contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document describes an optional mechanism within Intermediate\n
    \  System to Intermediate Systems (IS-ISs) used today by many ISPs for\n   IGP
    routing within their clouds.  This document describes how to run,\n   within a
    single IS-IS domain, a set of independent IP topologies that\n   we call Multi-Topologies
    (MTs).  This MT extension can be used for a\n   variety of purposes, such as an
    in-band management network \"on top\"\n   of the original IGP topology, maintaining
    separate IGP routing\n   domains for isolated multicast or IPv6 islands within
    the backbone,\n   or forcing a subset of an address space to follow a different\n
    \  topology.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Maintaining multiple MTs for IS-IS [ISO10589] [RFC1195]
    in a\n   backwards-compatible manner necessitates several extensions to the\n
    \  packet encoding and additional Shortest Path First (SPF) procedures.\n   The
    problem can be partitioned into the forming of adjacencies and\n   advertising
    of prefixes and reachable intermediate systems within\n   each topology.  Having
    put all the necessary additional information\n   in place, it must be properly
    used by MT capable SPF computation.\n   The following sections describe each of
    the problems separately.  To\n   simplify the text, \"standard\" IS-IS topology
    is defined to be MT ID\n   #0 (zero).\n"

  - "2.  Maintaining MT Adjacencies\n   Each adjacency formed MUST be classified as
    belonging to a set of MTs\n   on the interface.  This is achieved by adding a
    new TLV into IIH\n   packets that advertises to which topologies the interface
    belongs.\n   If MT #0 is the only MT on the interface, it is optional to advertise\n
    \  it in the new TLV.  Thus, not including such a TLV in the IIH implies\n   MT
    ID #0 capability only.  Through this exchange of MT capabilities,\n   a router
    is able to advertise the IS TLVs in LSPs with common MT set\n   over those adjacencies.\n
    \  The case of adjacency contains multiple MTs on an interface, and if\n   there
    exists an overlapping IP address space among the topologies,\n   additional mechanisms
    MUST be used to resolve the topology identity\n   of the incoming IP packets on
    the interface.  See further discussion\n   in Section 8.2.2 of this document.\n"

      interfaces are formed as usual with\n   IS-IS routers not implementing MT extensions.
      \ If a local router does\n   not participate in certain MTs, it will not advertise
      those MT IDs in\n   its IIHs and thus will not include that neighbor within
      its LSPs.  On\n   the other hand, if an MT ID is not detected in the remote
      side's\n   IIHs, the local router MUST NOT include that neighbor within its\n
      \  LSPs.  The local router SHOULD NOT form an adjacency if they don't\n   have

    - "2.2.  Forming Adjacencies on Broadcast Interfaces\n   On a LAN, all the routers
      on the LAN that implement the MT extension\n   MAY advertise their MT capability
      TLV in their IIHs.  If there is at\n   least one adjacency on the LAN interface
      that belongs to this MT, the\n   MT capable router MUST include the corresponding
      MT IS Reachable TLV\n   in its LSP, otherwise it MAY include this MT IS Reachable
      TLV in its\n   LSP if the LAN interface participates in this MT set.\n   Two
      routers on a LAN SHALL always establish adjacency, regardless of\n   whether
      or not they have a common MT.  This is to ensure all the\n   routers on the
      LAN can correctly elect the same DIS.  The IS SHOULD\n   NOT include the MT
      IS TLV in its LSP if none of the adjacencies on\n   the LAN contain this MT.\n
      \  The DIS, CSNP, and PSNP functions are not changed by MT extension.\n"

  - "3.  Advertising MT Reachable Intermediate Systems in LSPs\n   A router MUST include
    within its LSPs in the Reachable Intermediate\n   Systems TLV-only adjacent nodes
    that are participating in the\n   corresponding topology and advertise such TLVs
    only if it\n   participates itself in the corresponding topology.  The Standard\n
    \  Reachable Intermediate Systems TLV is acting here as MT ID #0, the\n   equivalent
    of the newly introduced MT Reachable Intermediate Systems\n   TLV.  A router MUST
    announce the MT IS TLV when there is at least one\n   adjacency on the interface
    that belongs to this MT, otherwise it MAY\n   announce the MT IS TLV of an adjacency
    for a given MT if this\n   interface participates in the LAN.\n   Since it is
    not possible to prevent a router that does not understand\n   MT extensions from
    being responsible for the generation of the\n   according pseudo-node, it is possible
    to neither introduce special\n   TLVs in the pseudo-node LSPs, nor run distinct
    DIS elections per MT.\n   Therefore, a generated pseudo-node LSP by DIS MUST contain\n
    \  in its IS Reachable TLV all nodes on the LAN as usual, regardless of\n   their
    MT capabilities.  In other words, there is no change to the\n   pseudo-node LSP
    construction.\n"

  - "4.  MTs and Overload, Partition, and Attached Bits\n   For each of the MTs, a
    router could become potentially partitioned,\n   overloaded, and attached independently.
    \ To prevent unnecessary\n   complexity, MT extensions do not support MT based
    partition repair.\n   The overload, partition, and attached bits in the LSP header
    only\n   reflect the status of the default topology.\n   Attached bit and overload
    bit are part of the MT TLV being\n   distributed within a node's LSP fragment
    zero.  Since each adjacency\n   can belong to different MTs, it is possible that
    some MTs are L2\n   attached, and others are not on the same router.  The overload
    bit in\n   the MT TLV can be used to signal the topology being overloaded.  An\n
    \  MT-based system is considered overloaded if the overload bit in the\n   MT
    is set.\n   Route leaking between the levels SHOULD only be performed within the\n
    \  same MT.\n"

    address space so a new TLV is\n   necessary for prefixes stored in MTs other than
    MT ID #0.  To make\n   the encoding less confusing when same prefixes are present
    in\n   multiple MTs and accelerate SPF per MT, rather than adding a sub-TLV\n
    \  in Traffic Engineered (TE) extensions, a new TLV is introduced for\n   that
    purpose that closely follows TE encoding [RFC3784].\n"

  - "6.  MT SPF Computation\n   Each MT MUST run its own instance of the decision
    process.  The\n   pseudo-node LSPs are used by all topologies during computation.
    \ Each\n   non-default topology MAY have its attached bit and overload bit set\n
    \  in the MT TLV.  A reverse-connectivity check within SPF MUST follow\n   the
    according MT to assure the bi-directional reachability within the\n   same MT.\n
    \  The results of each computation SHOULD be stored in a separate\n   Routing
    Information Base (RIB), in normal cases, otherwise\n   overlapping addresses in
    different topologies could lead to\n   undesirable routing behavior, such as forwarding
    loops.  The\n   forwarding logic and configuration need to ensure the same MT
    is\n   traversed from the source to the destination for packets.  The\n   nexthops
    derived from the MT SPF MUST belong to the adjacencies\n   conforming to the same
    MT for correct forwarding.  It is recommended\n   for the administrators to ensure
    consistent configuration of all\n   routers in the domain to prevent undesirable
    forwarding behavior.\n   No attempt is made in this document to allow one topology
    to\n   calculate routes using the routing information from another topology\n
    \  inside SPF.  Even though it is possible to redistribute and leak\n   routes
    from another IS-IS topology or from external sources, the\n   exact mechanism
    is beyond the scope of this document.\n"

  - "7.  Packet Encoding\n   Four new TLVs are added to support MT extensions.  One
    of them is\n   common for the LSPs and IIHs.  Encoding of Intermediate System
    TLV\n   and IPv4 Reachable Prefixes is tied to traffic engineering extensions\n
    \  [RFC3784] to simplify the implementation effort.  The main reasons we\n   chose
    to use new TLVs instead of using sub-TLVs inside existing TLV\n   type-22 and
    type-135 are:\n      1.  In many cases, multi-topologies are non-congruent, using
    the\n          sub-TLV approach will not save LSP space;\n      2.  Many sub-TLVs
    are already being used in TLV type-22, and many\n          more are being proposed
    while there is a maximum limit on the\n          TLV size, from the existing TLVs;\n
    \     3.  If traffic engineering or some other applications are being\n          applied
    per topology level later, the new TLVs can\n          automatically inherit the
    same attributes already defined for\n          the \"standard\" topology without
    going through long standard\n          process to redefine them per topology.\n"

        then the Differentiated Services Code\n   Point (DSCP) bits in the IP packet
        header can be utilized to make the\n   decision.  Some IP headers, or even
        packet data information, MAY be\n   checked to make the forwarding table selection,
        for example, the\n   source IP address in the header can be used to determine
        the desired\n   forwarding behavior.\n   This topic is not unique to IS-IS
        or even to Multi-topology, it is a\n   local policy and configuration decision
        to make sure the inbound\n   traffic uses the correct forwarding tables.  For
        example, preferred\n   customer packets are sent through a Layer 2 Tunneling
        Protocol (L2TP)\n   towards the high-bandwidth upstream provider, and other
        packets are\n   sent through a different L2TP to a normal-bandwidth provider.
        \ Those\n   mechanisms are not part of the L2TP protocol specifications.\n
        \  The generic approach of packet to multiple MT RIB mapping over the\n   same
        inbound interface is outside the scope of this document.\n"

        \  When there is no overlap in the address space among all the MTs,\n   strictly
        speaking, the destination address space classifies the\n   topology to which
        a packet belongs.  It is possible to install routes\n   from different MTs
        into a shared RIB.  As an example of such a\n   deployment, a special IS-IS
        topology can be set up for certain\n   External Border Gateway Protocol (eBGP)
        nexthop addresses.\n"

    - "8.3.  Some MTs Are Not Used for Forwarding Purposes\n   MT in IS-IS MAY be
      used even if the resulting RIB is not used for\n   forwarding purposes.  As
      an example, multicast Reverse Path\n   Forwarding (RPF) check can be performed
      on a different RIB than the\n   standard unicast RIB, albeit an entirely different
      RIB is used for\n   the multicast forwarding.  However, an incoming packet MUST
      still be\n   clearly identified as belonging to a unique topology.\n"

  - "9.  MT Network Management Considerations\n   When multiple IS-IS topologies exist
    within a domain, some of the\n   routers can be configured to participate in a
    subset of the MTs in\n   the network.  This section discusses some of the options
    we have to\n   enable operations or the network management stations to access
    those\n   routers.\n"

    - "9.1.  Create Dedicated Management Topology to Include All the Nodes\n   This
      approach is to set up a dedicated management topology or 'in-\n   band' management
      topology.  This 'mgmt' topology will include all the\n   routers need to be
      managed.  The computed routes in the topology will\n   be installed into the
      'mgmt' RIB.  In the condition that the 'mgmt'\n   topology uses a set of non-overlapping
      address space with the default\n   topology, those 'mgmt' routes can also be
      optionally installed into\n   the default RIB.  The advantages of duplicate
      'mgmt' routes in both\n   RIBs include:  the network management utilities on
      the system does\n   not have to be modified to use a specific RIB other than
      the default\n   RIB; the 'mgmt' topology can share the same link with the default\n
      \  topology if so designed.\n"

    - "9.2.  Extend the Default Topology to All the Nodes\n   Even in the case that
      default topology is not used on some of the\n   nodes in the IP forwarding,
      we MAY want to extend the default\n   topology to those nodes for the purpose
      of network management.\n   Operators SHOULD set high costs on the links that
      belong to the\n   extended portion of the default topology.  This way, the IP
      data\n   traffic will not be forwarded through those nodes during network\n
      \  topology changes.\n"

    \ No specific security\n   issues with the proposed solutions are known.  The
    authentication\n   procedure for IS-IS PDUs is the same regardless of MT information\n
    \  inside the IS-IS PDUs.\n   Note that an authentication mechanism, such as the
    one defined in\n   [RFC3567], SHOULD be applied if there is high risk resulting
    from\n   modification of multi-topology information.\n   As described in Section
    8.2.2, multiple topologies share an interface\n   in the same address space, some
    mechanism beyond IS-IS needs to be\n   used to select the right forwarding table
    for an inbound packet.  A\n   misconfiguration on the system or a packet with
    a spoofed source\n   address, for example, can lead to packet loss or unauthorized
    use of\n   premium network resource.\n"
