    \   called DUID-UUID.  DUID-UUIDs are derived from the already-\n   standardized\
    \ Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) format.  DUID-UUID\n   makes it possible\
    \ for devices to use UUIDs to identify themselves to\n   DHC servers and vice\
    \ versa.  UUIDs are globally unique and readily\n   available on many systems,\
    \ making them convenient identifiers to\n   leverage within DHCP.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   DHCP Unique Identifiers (DUIDs) are used in DHCPv6 to identify\n\
    \   clients and servers.  This document defines a new DHCP Unique\n   Identifier\
    \ (DUID) type that embeds a Universally Unique IDentifier\n   (UUID) [RFC4122].\
    \  UUIDs are already in widespread use and serve as\n   an existing identifier\
    \ that could be leveraged by DHCPv6.  For\n   example, x86-based systems ship\
    \ with an embedded UUID in firmware\n   that is readily available to the software\
    \ running on the device.\n   Although DUIDs are new to DHCPv6, identifying clients\
    \ in DHCP via a\n   UUID is not.  DHCPv4 [RFC2132] defines a Client Machine Identifier\n\
    \   Option (option 97) that embeds a UUID (aka a Globally Unique\n   Identifier\
    \ (GUID)) [RFC4578].  This document extends that capability\n   to DHCPv6.\n \
    \  Terminology specific to IPv6 and DHCPv6 is used as defined in the\n   \"Terminology\"\
    \ sections of [RFC3315].\n"
- title: 2.  Background
  contents:
  - "2.  Background\n   In DHCPv6, clients identify themselves to servers via DHCP\
    \ Unique\n   Identifiers (DUIDs) [RFC3315].  DUIDs are identifiers that DHCP\n\
    \   servers treat as opaque objects with no internal structure.  DUIDs\n   are\
    \ intended to be globally unique, with no two devices using the\n   same DUID.\
    \  Three DUIDs types have been defined previously:\n   DUID-LLT -  the Link-Layer\
    \ address of one of the device's network\n               interfaces, concatenated\
    \ with a timestamp\n   DUID-EN -   an Enterprise Number plus additional information\
    \ specific\n               to the enterprise\n   DUID-LL -   the Link-Layer address\
    \ of one of the device's network\n               interfaces\n   DUIDs are intended\
    \ to remain constant over time, so that they can be\n   used as permanent identifiers\
    \ for a device.  In the case of DUID-\n   LLTs, they are intended to be generated\
    \ once, stored in stable\n   storage, and reused from that point forward.\n  \
    \ One issue that has arisen concerns devices that employ multi-step\n   network\
    \ boot loading.  An initial step (typically run out of\n   firmware) loads a small\
    \ image that, in turn, loads a second image and\n   so forth until the actual\
    \ target system is loaded.  Each step in the\n   booting process may invoke DHCP.\
    \  In some operational environments,\n   it is important that each step in the\
    \ sequence use the same DUID, so\n   that the server knows it is getting requests\
    \ from the same device and\n   can return the proper configuration information\
    \ (including the\n   pointer to the correct image to load).\n   Unfortunately,\
    \ none of the previously defined DUIDs are ideal for\n   multi-step network booting.\
    \  The DUID-LLT and DUID-LL identifiers\n   that a given device may use are not\
    \ guaranteed to remain constant\n   across each booting step.  Even if the different\
    \ stages used DUID-LL\n   or DUID-LLT, on devices with multiple interfaces, there\
    \ is no way to\n   guarantee that the same interface (and hence DUID) will be\
    \ selected.\n   Finally, in the case of DUID-LLT, even if the same interface is\n\
    \   chosen, it can be difficult to ensure that each stage uses the same\n   timestamp\
    \ value.  While a DUID-EN could be defined and used, such\n   usage is proprietary\
    \ by definition.\n   This document defines a new DUID type, based on the Universally\n\
    \   Unique IDentifier (UUID) [RFC4122].  UUIDs are already used in\n   practice\
    \ and serve as an existing identifier that could be leveraged\n   by DHCP.  In\
    \ some environments, a UUID-based DUID is preferable to\n   the other existing\
    \ DUID types.\n   It should be noted that use of a DUID-UUID will not, by itself,\
    \ solve\n   all the network boot problems described in this document.  Given the\n\
    \   availability of a suitable DUID-UUID, implementations will still need\n  \
    \ to take steps to ensure that all boot stages use the same DUID-UUID\n   as appropriate.\
    \  Given that DHCP has already defined multiple DUID\n   types, the question of\
    \ which of several DUIDs to select from already\n   exists, and defining a new\
    \ DUID type does not, by itself, help.  It\n   is believed, however, that network\
    \ boot services can be configured to\n   use a DUID-UUID and that other software\
    \ can do so as well.  Ensuring\n   this happens in general is beyond the scope\
    \ of this document.\n"
- title: 3.  UUID Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  UUID Considerations\n   Although many UUIDs are in use today, not all UUIDs\
    \ meet DHCP's\n   requirements (see Section 9 of [RFC3315]).  DHCP UUIDs should\
    \ be\n   persistent across system restarts, system reconfiguration events,\n \
    \  system software and operating system upgrades or reinstallation as\n   well\
    \ as be easily available to any part of the boot process that\n   requires access\
    \ to the DHCP UUID.  For example, UUIDs used in\n   Microsoft's Component Object\
    \ Module (COM), and for labeling\n   partitions in filesystems, are likely not\
    \ appropriate as they may not\n   be accessible to firmware boot loaders and can\
    \ change over time.\n   Implementations of this specification using DUID-UUID\
    \ must select a\n   UUID that is persistent across system restart and reconfiguration\n\
    \   events and that is available to all DHCP protocol agents that may\n   need\
    \ to identify themselves.  For instance, a UUID that is part of\n   the system\
    \ firmware, or managed by the system firmware, satisfies\n   this requirement.\n"
