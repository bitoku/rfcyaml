  - "            TELNET OUTPUT VERTICAL TAB DISPOSITION OPTION\n1. Command name and\
    \ code\n   NAOVTD 15\n      (Negotiate About Output Vertcial Tab Disposition)\n\
    2. Command meanings\n   In the following, we are discussing a simplex connection,\
    \ as\n   described in the NAOL and NAOP Telnet Options specifications.\n     \
    \ IAC DO NAOVTD\n         The data sender requests or agrees to negotiate about\
    \ output\n         vertical tab character disposition with the data receiver.\n\
    \t In the case where agreement has been reached and in the\n\t absence of further\
    \ subnegotiations, the data receiver is\n\t assumed to be handling output vertical\
    \ tab character considerations.\n      IAC DON'T NAOVTD\n         The data sender\
    \ refuses to negotiate about output vertical tab\n         character disposition\
    \ with the data receiver, or demands a\n         return to the unnegotiated default\
    \ mode.\n      IAC WILL NAOVTD\n         The data receiver requests or agrees\
    \ to negotiate about output\n         vertical tab character disposition with\
    \ the sender.  In the\n         case where agreement has been reached and in the\
    \ absence of further\n         subnegotiations, the data receiver alone is assumed\
    \ to be\n         handling output vertical tab character considerations.\n   \
    \   IAC WON'T NAOVTD\n         The data receiver refuses to negotiate about output\
    \ vertical\n         tab character disposition, or demands a return to the unnegotiated\n\
    \         default mode.\n      IAC SB NAOVTD DS <8-bit value> IAC SE\n       \
    \  The data sender specifies, with the 8-bit value, which party\n         should\
    \ handle output vertical tab characters and what their\n         disposition should\
    \ be.  The code for DS is 1.\n      IAC SB NAOVTD DR <8-bit value> IAC SE\n  \
    \       The data receiver specifies, with the 8-bit value, which party\n     \
    \    should handle output vertical tab characters and what their\n         disposition\
    \ should be.  The code for DR is 0.\n3. Default\n   DON'T NAOVTD/WON'T NAOVTD\n\
    \      In the default absence of negotiations concerning which party,\n      data\
    \ sender or data receiver, is handling output vertical tab character\n      considerations,\
    \ neither party is required to handle vertical tab\n      characters and neither\
    \ party is prohibited from handling them; but\n      it is appropriate if at least\
    \ the data receiver handles vertical tab\n      character considerations, albeit\
    \ primitively.\n   the DS and DR SB commands as follows:\n      8 bit value  \
    \ Meaning\n      0             Command sender suggests that he alone will handle\n\
    \                    vertical tab characters, for the connection.\n      1 to\
    \ 250      Command sender suggests that the other party alone\n              \
    \      should handle tab characters, but suggests that a \n\t\t    delay of the\
    \ indicated value be used. The value is \n\t\t    the number of character-times\
    \ to wait or number of\n\t            NULs to insert in the data stream before\
    \ sending the \n\t\t    next data character.\n      251           Command sender\
    \ suggests that the other party alone\n                    handle vertical tabs,\
    \ but suggests that each \n\t\t    occurrence of the character be replaced by\
    \ \n\t\t    carriage-return/linefeed.\n      252           Command sender suggests\
    \ that the other party alone\n                    handle vertical tabs, but suggests\
    \ that they be discarded.\n      253           Command sender suggests that the\
    \ other party alone\n                    should handle tab characters, but suggests\
    \ that \n\t\t    tabbing be simulated.\n      254           Command sender suggests\
    \ that the other party alone\n                    should handle the output disposition\
    \ but suggests \n\t\t    waiting for a character to be transmitted (on the \n\t\
    \t    other simplex connection) before sending more data.\n\t            Note\
    \ that, due to the assynchrony of the two \n\t\t    simplex connections, phase\
    \ problems can occur with \n\t\t    this option.\n      255           Command\
    \ sender suggests that the other party alone\n                    should handle\
    \ the output disposition and suggests \n\t\t    nothing about how it should be\
    \ done.\n   The guiding rules are that:\n      1. if neither data receiver nor\
    \ data sender wants to handle the \n      output vertical tab characters, the\
    \ data receiver must do it, and\n      2. if both data receiver and data sender\
    \ want to handle the output\n      vertical tab characters, the data sender gets\
    \ to do it.\n   The reasoning for the former rule is that if neither want to do\
    \ it, then\n   the default in the NAOVTD option dominates.  If both want to do\
    \ it, the\n   sender, who is presumed to have special knowledge about the data,\
    \ should\n   be allowed to do it, taking into account any suggestions the receiver\
    \ may\n   make.  Simulation is defined as the replacement of the character by\n\
    \   enough line-feeds (only) to advance the paper (or line-pointer) to the\n \
    \  next vertical tab stop.  \n   Note that delays, controlled by the data sender,\
    \ must consist of NUL\n   characters, inserted immediately after the line-feed\
    \ character.  This is\n   necessary due to the assynchrony of network transmissions.\
    \  As with all\n   option negotiations, neither party should suggest a state already\
    \ in\n   effect except to refuse to negotiate; changes should be acknowledged;\
    \ and\n   once refused, an option should not be resuggested until \"something\n"
