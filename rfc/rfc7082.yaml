- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol (CCMP) document\n\
    \   (RFC 6503) defines a way for a client to discover a conference\n   control\
    \ server that supports CCMP.  However, it does not define a way\n   for a client\
    \ involved in a conference to determine if the conference\n   focus supports CCMP.\
    \  This information would allow a CCMP-enabled\n   client that joins a conference\
    \ using SIP to also register for the\n   Centralized Conferencing (XCON) conference\
    \ event package and take\n   advantage of CCMP operations on the conference.\n\
    \   This document describes two mechanisms, depending upon the need of\n   the\
    \ User Agent (UA), to address the above limitation.  The first\n   mechanism uses\
    \ the Call-Info header field, and the second mechanism\n   defines a new value\
    \ for the \"purpose\" header field parameter in the\n   <service-uris> element\
    \ in the SIP conferencing event package.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 5239 [RFC5239] defines a framework for Centralized Conferencing\n\
    \   (XCON), which allows participants to exchange media in a centralized\n   unicast\
    \ conference.  The framework also outlines a set of\n   conferencing protocols\
    \ for building advanced conferencing\n   applications.\n   The Centralized Conferencing\
    \ Manipulation Protocol (CCMP) [RFC6503]\n   allows authenticated and authorized\
    \ users to create, manipulate, and\n   delete conference objects.  Operations\
    \ on conferences include adding\n   and removing participants and changing their\
    \ roles, as well as adding\n   and removing media streams and associated end points.\n\
    \   CCMP defines a way for an XCON-aware client to discover whether a\n   conference\
    \ control server supports CCMP.  However, it does not define\n   a way for a SIP\
    \ client involved in a conference to determine if the\n   conference focus [RFC4353]\
    \ supports CCMP.  Knowing that a focus\n   supports CCMP would allow a SIP client\
    \ (that is also XCON aware) that\n   joins a conference using SIP-based conferencing\
    \ [RFC4579] to also\n   register for the XCON conference event package [RFC6502]\
    \ and take\n   advantage of CCMP operations on the conference.\n   This document\
    \ describes two options to address the above limitation,\n   depending on the\
    \ need of the User Agent (UA).  The first option uses\n   the Call-Info [RFC3261]\
    \ header, which is suitable for application\n   servers that need to discover\
    \ if a UA supports CCMP.  The second\n   option defines a new value for the \"\
    purpose\" header field parameter\n   in the <service-uris> element in the SIP\
    \ conferencing event package\n   [RFC4575] that is suitable for a UA that would\
    \ typically subscribe to\n   the conference event package.\n   Appendix A has\
    \ a brief description of other options that we\n   considered as possible solutions.\
    \  Those other options were not\n   selected, however, because the options described\
    \ in this document\n   better address the problem we are trying to solve.\n"

- title: 2.  Solutions
  contents:
  - "2.  Solutions\n   This section defines two mechanisms that can be used by a SIP\
    \ UA to\n   discover whether the conference that a client has joined, per the\
    \ SIP\n   signaling procedures defined in [RFC4579], supports CCMP.\n   Specifically,\
    \ the mechanisms allow the client to know that the URI\n   representing the conference\
    \ focus, as defined in [RFC4579], is an\n   XCON-URI as defined in [RFC6501].\n"
- title: 2.1.  Call-Info
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Call-Info\n   This approach uses the Call-Info header in various requests\
    \ and\n   responses.\n   The Call-Info header consists of two parts: a URI and\
    \ a \"purpose\"\n   header field parameter.  The URI provides the XCON-URI of\
    \ the\n   conference focus, and a new value for the \"purpose\" header field\n\
    \   parameter indicates that the conference focus supports CCMP.\n   While the\
    \ XCON-URI by itself should be enough to indicate that the\n   conference focus\
    \ supports CCMP, the \"purpose\" header field parameter\n   with a value of 'ccmp'\
    \ provides an easier way for a UA that does not\n   use the conference event package\
    \ to discover that the conference\n   focus supports CCMP, without parsing the\
    \ URI.\n   The Call-Info header, with the XCON-URI and the \"purpose\" header\n\
    \   field parameter with the 'ccmp' value, can be used with any INVITE\n   request\
    \ or response and with a response to an OPTIONS request.\n   This approach would\
    \ be suitable for a UA, e.g., an application server\n   that acts as a Back-to-Back\
    \ User Agent (B2BUA), that is interested in\n   discovering that a conference\
    \ focus supports CCMP but does not use\n   the XCON conference event package [RFC6502].\
    \  In this case, the\n   application could use the OPTIONS request and discover\
    \ CCMP support\n   from the response.\n   This approach would also be suitable\
    \ for a conference focus that\n   initiates an INVITE request to a SIP UA to add\
    \ a participant to a\n   conference, as it would allow the conference focus to\
    \ indicate that\n   it supports CCMP with the INVITE request sent to the UA.\n\
    \   The advantage of this approach is the ability to discover that a\n   conference\
    \ focus supports CCMP, without subscribing to the XCON event\n   package [RFC6502].\
    \  The disadvantage is the need, in some cases, for\n   an extra request, i.e.,\
    \ an additional OPTIONS request, to discover\n   that a conference focus supports\
    \ CCMP.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Service URI Purpose
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Service URI Purpose\n   This approach defines an additional URI 'purpose'\
    \ of 'ccmp'\n   associated with a <service-uris> element in the SIP conferencing\n\
    \   event package.  The XCON-URI for the conference is included in the\n   'uri'\
    \ element, per the following example:\n      <service-uris>\n        <entry>\n\
    \          <uri>XCON:conf1@example.com</uri>\n          <purpose>ccmp</purpose>\n\
    \        </entry>\n      </service-uris>\n   The advantage of this approach is\
    \ that it uses an existing mechanism\n   for extending the <purpose> field of\
    \ the <service-uris> element in\n   the conferencing event package [RFC4353].\
    \  The disadvantage is that\n   it requires the client to subscribe to the conference\
    \ event package.\n   This approach would be suitable for a SIP UA that would typically\n\
    \   subscribe to the conference event package.  Knowing that a conference\n  \
    \ supports CCMP allows a SIP UA that is XCON aware to make use of the\n   CCMP\
    \ operations and allows it to subscribe to the XCON event package\n   [RFC6502]\
    \ to get additional information related to the conference.\n"
- title: 3.  Overall Process
  contents:
  - "3.  Overall Process\n   CCMP capability is discovered using the two methods described\
    \ in\n   Section 2.  The order in which the two methods are tried depends on\n\
    \   whether an implementation subscribes to the conference event package\n   by\
    \ default.\n   A UA implementation that subscribes to the conference event package\n\
    \   can examine the conference description to see if a URI with\n   <purpose>ccmp</purpose>\
    \ is specified (Section 2.2).  An\n   implementation that does not subscribe to\
    \ the conference event\n   package can perform an OPTIONS query when connecting\
    \ to the\n   conference server.  UAs MUST NOT attempt both methods with the same\n\
    \   server.\n   Conference servers MUST reflect the same information using both\n\
    \   discovery channels.  A server MUST indicate CCMP support through the\n   conference\
    \ event package if and only if it indicates support through\n   the Call-Info\
    \ header in OPTIONS responses.  This prevents the need\n   for UAs to try both\
    \ methods.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document defines no new headers or data\
    \ elements; it reuses\n   existing headers and data elements.  CCMP already allows\
    \ a client the\n   ability to discover if a conference server supports CCMP, using\
    \ a DNS\n   mechanism as defined in [RFC6503] Section 12.4.\n   Thus, the solution\
    \ options defined in this document do not introduce\n   any new security threats.\n"

  - "Appendix A.  Other Approaches Considered\n   The following two options were considered\
    \ as possible solutions but\n   were not selected because the options described\
    \ in this document\n   better address the problem we are trying to solve.\n"
- title: A.1.  Feature Tag
  contents:
  - "A.1.  Feature Tag\n   This approach defines a feature parameter 'ccmp' to indicate\
    \ that a\n   SIP dialog belongs to a conference that supports CCMP.  The use of\n\
    \   feature parameters in Contact header fields to describe the\n   characteristics\
    \ and capabilities of a UA is described in the User\n   Agent Capabilities document\
    \ [RFC3840].\n   The conference focus behavior regarding the handling of the 'ccmp'\n\
    \   feature is the same as the behavior for the handling of the 'isfocus'\n  \
    \ feature parameter.  In session establishment, a conference focus MUST\n   include\
    \ the 'ccmp' feature parameter in the Contact header field\n   unless the conference\
    \ focus wishes to hide the fact that it is a\n   conference focus.\n   The advantages\
    \ of this approach are a one-step discovery of the\n   conference focus and its\
    \ support for the 'ccmp' feature and the fact\n   that it can be used in response\
    \ to an OPTIONS request, and that it\n   enables the discovery of the 'ccmp' capability\
    \ by any network element\n   that does not need the conference event package.\
    \  The disadvantage is\n   the definition of a new feature parameter.\n"
- title: A.2.  Conference URI Purpose
  contents:
  - "A.2.  Conference URI Purpose\n   This approach defines an additional URI 'purpose'\
    \ of 'ccmp'\n   associated with a 'conf-uris' element in the SIP conferencing\
    \ event\n   package.\n   ccmp: Indicates that the conference focus represented\
    \ by this URI\n      supports 'ccmp'; this in turn allows a client to use CCMP\
    \ to\n      manipulate the conference.  This URI MUST be an XCON-URI as\n    \
    \  defined in the XCON data model specification [RFC6501].\n      <conf-uris>\n\

    \          <purpose>ccmp</purpose>\n        </entry>\n      </conf-uris>\n   The\
    \ advantage of the SIP conference event package options is the use\n   of an existing\
    \ mechanism for extending the <purpose> field of the\n   <service-uris> or <conf-uris>\
    \ elements.  The disadvantage is the\n   requirement that the client register\
    \ for the conference event\n   package.\n"
