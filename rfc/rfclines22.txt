Host Host Control Message Formats NWG/RFC 11 has been modified at UCLA; and will be republished.
In the meantime, it seems important to report a new control message format which does not use 7 bit ASCII character mode of transmission.
All Host Host control messages consist of sequences of 8 bit bytes of the form: <control byte>
It is reasonable to transmit more than one control message in any given packet, although this is not mandatory.
Presently, 9 control messages have been defined by UCLA; these are given in the table below along with their parameters.
The interpretation is given from the point of view of the transmitting host.
("L" or "Li" mean Link#, and are binary values.)
Please establish auxiliary connection <2
Your primary output link <3
We cannot establish a <5
This is called the CEASE directive.
our output link number L.
You may get this message before the last message arrives over this link since control messages are higher priority than regular data messages.
that is, you may resume transmitting over output link number L.
Each control message is embedded in the appropriate message structure e.g.:
The header for all HOST HOST control messages is given below: 0
