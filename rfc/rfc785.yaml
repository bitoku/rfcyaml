  contents:
  - "INTRODUCTION\n   This document defines the ISI TOPS20s interface between the\
    \ Mail\n   Transfer Protocol (MTP) and a mail creation system (e.g., MM, HERMES,\n\
    \   etc.) in terms of the files which implement it.  The internal\n   structure\
    \ and name of each file is described below.\n   For a complete understanding of\
    \ the MTP protocol as well as the terms\n   used within this document, see RFC\
    \ 780, \"Mail Transfer Protocol\".\n"
- title: DESCRIPTION
  contents:
  - "DESCRIPTION\n   For each piece of mail, the TOPS20 interface between a mail creation\n\
    \   system and MTP is comprised of two files.  The first file must be\n   named\
    \ \"^V[--UNSENT-MAIL-CONTROL--^V].MTP.-1\", where \"^V\" represents\n   the character\
    \ \"control V\" (ASCII code 026) and the generation number\n   \"-1\" indicates\
    \ the next higher generation number (at the time of the\n   file's creation).\
    \  It is strongly suggested that the second file be\n   named \"^V[--UNSENT-MAIL-FILE--^V].MTP.-1\"\
    , where \"^V\" and \"-1\" are as\n   defined before.  (However, the actual file\
    \ name may be chosen by the\n   mail creation system.)  Both these files reside\
    \ in the directory of\n   the user who created the mail (as is currently the case\
    \ with the\n   MAILER-based system).\n   \"^V[--UNSENT-MAIL-CONTROL--^V].MTP.-1\"\
    \ is the control file.  It is an\n   ASCIZ file and contains all information necessary\
    \ to relay the mail\n   through MTP.  It consists of a pointer to the mail text,\
    \ the\n   source-path, and all destination-paths.\n   First is \"FILE:\" followed\
    \ by the FULL mail text file name (which must\n   include directory name and generation\
    \ number) followed by <CRLF>\n   (ASCII code 15 followed by ASCII code 12).  Note\
    \ that a structure\n   name is allowed; if not given \"PS:\" will be assumed.\
    \  Also note that\n   for each character that must be quoted in a file name the\
    \ quote\n   character (^V) must be present in the string following \"FILE:\".\
    \  Next\n   is \"FROM:\" followed by the <FROM-path> followed by <CRLF>.  Finally,\n\
    \   each destination is given in the form \"TO:\" followed by the <TO-path>\n\
    \   followed by <CRLF>.  The FROM- and TO-paths include surrounding angle\n  \
    \ brackets (i.e., <...>) and are identical respectively to the source-\n   and\
    \ destination-paths described in RFC 780.\n"

- title: DISCUSSION
  contents:
  - "DISCUSSION\n   The older mail creation systems create N copies of a mail text\
    \ file,\n   one for each of the N addresses in the TO, CC, and BCC fields.  Each\n\
    \   file is named \"^V[--UNSENT-MAIL--^V].<mailbox>^V@<host>.-1\", where\n   <mailbox>\
    \ and <host> are as defined in MTP, and \"^V\" and \"-1\" are as\n   defined above.\n\
    \   The interface between the mail creation system and MTP requires only\n   the\
    \ creation of two files, regardless of the number of addresses in\n   the TO,\
    \ CC, and BCC fields.  The control file contains the\n   source-path and destination-paths\
    \ information as well as a pointer to\n   the mail text file.  The mail text file\
    \ contains the the RFC 733\n   header and body.\n"
