Introduction Interworking between X.400(88) and MIME is achieved by [4], which complements RFC 1327 [2], which in turn specifies the interworking between X.400(88) and RFC 822 based mail.
Interworking between X.400(88) and X.400 (84) is achieved by RFC 1328 [3].
That document does not describe what to do in the case where body parts arrive at the gateway that cannot be adequately represented in the X.400(84) system.
This document describes how RFC 1328 must be modified in order to provide adequate support for the scenarios: SMTP(MIME)   X.400(84) X.400(84)
It replaces chapter 6 of RFC 1328.
The rest of RFC 1328 is NOT obsoleted.
A desireable side effect of HARPOON is that a standardized method for the identification and transmission of multimedia and binary data (like spreadsheets) between X.400/84 UAs is achieved.
While this method is not compatible with current proprietary approaches, we believe that it requires less invasive changes to current UAs than other possible methods.
This memo updates RFC 1328.
HARPOON is a pure name, and has no meaning.

The approach is to imagine that the connection X.400(84)
This, of course, is an illusion, but can be a very useful illusion.
All mail will therefore go on one of the paths X.400(84)
X.400(84) when it goes between a MIME user and an X.400(84) user.
The approach at the interface between X.400(88) and X.400(84) is:  Convert what you can  Encapsulate what you have to
Never drop a message Of course, for X.400/88 body parts that are already defined in X.400/84, no downgrading should be done.
In particular, multi body messages should remain multi body messages, IA5 messages including IA5 messages encoded as Extended Body Parts) should remain IA5 messages, and G3Fax messages should remain G3Fax messages.
Some body parts are defined by X.400(88) as having both a Basic form and an Extended form.
These are listed in Annex B of X.420.
For all of these, the transformation from the Extended Body Part to the Basic Body Part takes the form of putting the PARAMETERS and the DATA members together in a SEQUENCE.
This transformation should be applied by the gateway in order to allow (for example) X.400(88) systems that use the Extended form of the IA5 body part to communicate with X.400(84) systems.
Encapsulation format For any body part that cannot be used directly in X.400(84), the following IA5Text body part is made:  Content
IA5String  First bytes of content: (the description is in USASCII, with C escape sequences used to represent control characters):
MIME version: <version>\r\n Content type:
<the proper MIME content type>\r\n Content transfer encoding: <quoted printable or base64>\r\n <Possibly other Content headings here, terminated by\r\n
\r\n <Here follows the bytes of the content, as per [4], encoded in the proper encoding
All implementations MUST place the MIME version:
header first in the body part.
Headers that are placed by [2] and [4] into other parts of the message MUST NOT be placed in the MIME body part.
This includes RFC 822 headings carried as heading extensions, which must be placed in a new IA5 body part starting with the string "RFC  822 HEADERS", as specified in [2], Appendix G. Other heading extensions are still handled as described in chapter 5 of RFC 1328: They are dropped.
Since all X.400(88) body parts can be represented in MIME by using the x400 bp MIME content type, this conversion will never fail.
In the reverse direction, any IA5 body part that starts with the token "MIME Version:" will be subjected to conversion according to [4] before including the body part into an X.400(88) message.
The implications are several: People with X.400(84) readers who have the ability to save messages to file will now be able to save MIME multimedia messages People who can use features like the "Mailcaps" file to identify what to do about a bodypart can now grab implementations of MIME that can run as subprograms and achieve at least some multimedia functionality 5.
The security considerations in [1] and [4] (beware of trojans that can hit you if your UA automagically starts programs for you) are now relevant also for X.400(84) systems.
