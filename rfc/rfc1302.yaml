- title: 1. PURPOSE
  contents:
  - "1. PURPOSE\n   The purpose of this document is to define the role of NICs in\
    \ the\n   Internet and establish guidelines for new and existing NICs regarding\n\
    \   the user services they provide.  This document is also a move toward\n   standardizing\
    \ NIC services, which will aid in the development of an\n   overall information\
    \ infrastructure that will allow NICs to easily and\n   routinely cooperate in\
    \ assisting users.\n   NICs for networks that are part of the Internet may be\
    \ called upon to\n   serve users of the greater Internet as well as those of their\
    \ own\n   networks.  This responsibility brings with it the added challenge of\n\
    \   coordinating services with other NICs to better serve the general\n   Internet\
    \ community.  Toward that end, this document also proposes\n   some easily implemented\
    \ changes to facilitate the exchange of\n   information and services between NICs.\n"
- title: 2. DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES
  contents:
  - "2. DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES\n   The NISI working group observed several guidelines\
    \ when developing\n   this FYI RFC.\n     1.  While recognizing that the new infrastructure\
    \ should be built\n     on existing services, programs, and technology, the working\
    \ group\n     did not want to limit its thinking to the present, preferring to\n\
    \     consider new approaches and to think toward the future.  The goal\n    \
    \ is to move in the direction of an information services\n     infrastructure\
    \ for the National Research and Education Network\n     (NREN).\n     2.  The\
    \ working group recognizes that a user support system must\n     accommodate a\
    \ diverse user population, from novice to network\n     sophisticate.\n     3.\
    \  The working group recognizes that not all NICs are interested\n     in providing\
    \ service at the Internet level nor in providing service\n     directly to end\
    \ users.  Some NICs have special areas of interest\n     and serve a more limited\
    \ community.  Many campus NICs, for example,\n     restrict the scope of their\
    \ efforts to campus computing activities.\n     Therefore, an Internet NIC must\
    \ have policies, procedures, and\n     delivery mechanisms in place to serve not\
    \ only end-users, but to\n     aid other information providers and user support\
    \ agencies.\n"
- title: 3.  DEFINITION OF A NIC AND OF A NOC
  contents:
  - "3.  DEFINITION OF A NIC AND OF A NOC\n   A Network Information Center is an organization\
    \ whose goal is to\n   provide informational, administrative, and procedural support,\n\
    \   primarily to users of its network and, secondarily, to users of the\n   greater\
    \ Internet and to other service agencies.\n   A Network Operations Center (NOC)\
    \ is an organization whose goal is to\n   oversee and maintain the daily operations\
    \ of a network.  Although\n   sometimes one organization may fulfill the duties\
    \ of both a NIC and a\n   NOC, this document assumes NIC functions to be separate\
    \ from NOC\n   functions and addresses NIC functions only.  Obviously, however,\
    \ a\n   NIC must work closely with its NOC to ensure users get the best\n   service\
    \ possible.\n"
- title: 4.  HISTORY
  contents:
  - "4.  HISTORY\n   When the original Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET)\n\
    \   was formed, SRI was assigned the essential administrative task of\n   registering\
    \ every host on the network and maintaining the Official\n   Host Table.  This\
    \ host table was needed to interconnect the hosts\n   into a network.  SRI also\
    \ became the repository for the RFCs, most of\n   which were only available in\
    \ paper copies because a file transfer\n   protocol had yet to be specified. \
    \ Because of its role as a central\n   information repository in these ways, SRI\
    \ became the natural place\n   for users to call with questions, and the first\
    \ NIC was born.\n   In 1984, the original network split into two networks: the\
    \ ARPANET\n   and the MILNET.  The ARPANET was laid to rest in 1990, and the\n\
    \   original NIC became the Defense Data Network NIC (DDN-NIC).  This NIC\n  \
    \ was sometimes referred to as the \"SRI-NIC\" or sometimes simply as\n   \"the\
    \ NIC\".  Today this NIC is maintained by Government Systems, Inc.,\n   and provides\
    \ information services to the MILNET portion of the DDN,\n   as well as performing\
    \ several administrative duties that serve the\n   entire Internet community.\
    \  SRI continues to provide general Internet\n   information services and maintains\
    \ an FTP repository.\n   The days of having just one or two networks are long\
    \ gone.  Today,\n   the Internet is an international collection of thousands of\
    \ networks\n   interconnected with the TCP/IP protocols.  Users of any one of\
    \ these\n   networks can use the network services provided by TCP/IP to reach\
    \ any\n   of the other networks.\n   There are other major wide area networks,\
    \ such as BITNET and DECnet\n   networks, that are not based on the TCP/IP protocols\
    \ and are thus not\n   considered part of the Internet itself.  However, users\
    \ can\n   communicate between these networks and the Internet via electronic\n\
    \   mail, so Internet NICs often answer questions regarding these\n   networks.\n\
    \   NICs exist for many of the networks that make up today's Internet.\n   For\
    \ example, in addition to the MILNET, in the United States there\n   are the National\
    \ Science Foundation Network (NSFNET), the Energy\n   Science Network (ESnet),\
    \ and the NASA Science Internet (NSI).  All of\n   these networks provide NICs.\n\
    \   BITNET is a non-TCP/IP network that is accessible to the Internet via\n  \
    \ electronic mail.  Its administrative organization, the Corporation\n   for Research\
    \ and Educational Networking (CREN), supports NIC services\n   for BITNET users.\n\
    \   Many networks in countries other than the United States also provide\n   NIC\
    \ services.  For example, such services exist for NORDUnet, which\n   connects\
    \ national networks in the Nordic countries, and JANet, the\n   Joint Academic\
    \ Network in the United Kingdom.  The BITNET\n   counterparts in Europe and Canada\
    \ are the European Academic and\n   Research Network (EARN) and NetNorth, respectively.\n"
- title: 5.  ESSENTIAL NIC FUNCTIONS
  contents:
  - "5.  ESSENTIAL NIC FUNCTIONS\n   Network Information Centers exist to provide\
    \ services that make using\n   the network easier and more attractive to users.\n\
    \   To help meet this goal, four essential NIC functions have been\n   identified\
    \ as those that every Internet NIC should perform.  These\n   are the basic functions\
    \ that define the minimum level of Internet\n   information service.  Each Internet\
    \ NIC should:\n     - Provide information resources.\n     - Support end-users\
    \ through direct contact.\n     - Collect and maintain NIC referral information.\n\
    \     - Support the NIC infrastructure.\n   The level of each service and the\
    \ exact mechanisms for providing\n   these services depend on the needs of the\
    \ particular network user\n   community.  Funding, staffing, and implementation\
    \ issues related to\n   these functions are left up to individual NIC organizations.\n\
    \   Presently, only the first two functions, providing information\n   resources\
    \ and directly supporting end-users, are routinely performed\n   by Internet NICs.\
    \  The variety of ways in which these services are\n   provided is described more\
    \ fully in the section on, \"Examples of\n   Present NIC Services\".\n   The last\
    \ two functions, collecting information about other NICs and\n   supporting the\
    \ NIC infrastructure, are new roles that have evolved as\n   the Internet community\
    \ and the number of NICs have grown.\n   Each of these four essential functions\
    \ is discussed in some depth in\n   this section.\n"
- title: 5.1  Provide Information Resources
  contents:
  - "5.1  Provide Information Resources\n   Information resources refers to both online\
    \ and hard-copy resources,\n   such as online files, marketing information, and\
    \ newsletters.  NICs\n   help users gain access to relevant information in several\
    \ ways.\n     - Obtain information online from other sites and store\n       it\
    \ at the local NIC where users may access it.\n     - Refer users to information\
    \ stored at other locations\n       around the Internet.  This option requires\
    \ that each\n       NIC maintain up-to-date information regarding such\n     \
    \  Internet resources.\n     - Create information, such as newsletters, marketing\n\
    \       information, tutorial files or documents, and make\n       it available\
    \ to users.  In this case, the \"creating\n       NIC\" is solely responsible\
    \ for the content and\n       accuracy of the information provided.\n   In all\
    \ of the cases above, users need a way to verify the\n   authenticity and currentness\
    \ of the information.  Accordingly, each\n   NIC should provide the following\
    \ information for everything it makes\n   available to its users and the Internet\
    \ community: 1) a time stamp,\n   2) a revision number, and 3) the name of the\
    \ NIC that produced the\n   document.  The NIC should also maintain contact information\
    \ regarding\n   the source of a file, but does not necessarily have to include\
    \ such a\n   contact in the online file.\n"
- title: 5.2  Support End-Users
  contents:
  - "5.2  Support End-Users\n   A NIC serves as the principle source of network information\
    \ for its\n   end users.  NICs field a variety of user inquiries, such as requests\n\
    \   for how to get connected to the Internet, how to locate and access a\n   particular\
    \ application on the network, how to determine an e-mail\n   address, and how\
    \ to solve operational problems.  Each NIC must take a\n   best effort approach\
    \ to responding to these inquiries and take\n   responsibility for a user inquiry\
    \ until it is resolved in some way.\n   Resolution may be answering the question,\
    \ referring the user to the\n   appropriate information source, or coordinating\
    \ with a NOC to resolve\n   a user connectivity problem.\n   To facilitate this\
    \ role of information provider, the following\n   delivery mechanisms are used:\n\
    \     - Telephone \"hotline\" support.  All NICs need to be\n       available\
    \ to answer phone inquiries during the\n       business day.\n     - Electronic\
    \ mail.  An electronic mail address acts as\n       an electronic help desk. \
    \ For consistency, the\n       electronic mail address should be of the form\n\
    \       NIC@domain (e.g., NIC@DDN.MIL).  Such a common\n       addressing convention\
    \ will move toward\n       standardization of these \"electronic help desks\"\
    \ and\n       will increase the chance that users will know where\n       to ask\
    \ for help.  In addition, a user inquiry to a\n       NIC e-mail address should\
    \ either produce a human\n       response or an up-to-date machine response that\n\
    \       performs a triage function by advising the user\n       where to go for\
    \ particular categories of problems.\n       For example, a message to NIC@NSF.NET\
    \ could return a\n       message alerting the user to the NNSC@NNSC.NSF.NET\n\
    \       and the NSFNET-INFO@MERIT.EDU mailboxes, both of\n       which provide\
    \ information for NSFNET.\n     - Electronic information transfer.  NICs should\n\
    \       provide information in electronic form, and make it\n       available\
    \ across the Internet through mechanisms\n       such as anonymous file transfer,\
    \ electronic mail,\n       and remote databases.\n"
- title: 5.3  Collect and Maintain NIC Referral Information
  contents:
  - "5.3  Collect and Maintain NIC Referral Information\n   With the recent dramatic\
    \ increase in the number of networks, users,\n   and applications accessible via\
    \ the Internet, it is impossible for\n   any one NIC to maintain comprehensive,\
    \ up-to-date information of all\n   the services and information available.  Because\
    \ such information is\n   distributed among many NICs, it is essential for each\
    \ NIC to be aware\n   of other NICs and their areas of expertise.  Such shared\
    \ information\n   among NICs ensures that Internet users will be referred promptly\
    \ to\n   the correct information resource.\n   In an effort to gather data about\
    \ NICs and their resources,\n   information will be solicited from each NIC and\
    \ placed in a database\n   called \"nic-profiles\".  This database will be available\
    \ to all NICs.\n   Such shared information among NICs ensures that Internet users\
    \ will\n   be referred promptly to the correct information resource.  For\n  \
    \ information regarding joining or using the nic-profiles database,\n   send a\
    \ message to nic-forum-request@merit.edu.\n"
- title: 5.4  Support the NIC Infrastructure
  contents:
  - "5.4  Support the NIC Infrastructure\n   It is essential that each NIC take an\
    \ active part in supporting the\n   NIC/Internet infrastructure.  Two means of\
    \ providing such support are\n   suggested here.\n     - Attend the IETF User\
    \ Services Working Group (USWG).\n       NICs are encouraged to participate in\
    \ the USWG, an\n       ongoing working group of the IETF, which is\n       chartered\

  - "8. DATABASE ACCURACY ISSUES\n   As has been mentioned elsewhere in this paper,\
    \ NICs often are the\n   sites of databases of various types of information, which\
    \ are\n   maintained for various reasons.  It is recommended that NICs\n   emphasize\
    \ the importance of keeping such data as accurate as\n   possible.  In addition,\
    \ it is important to allow people some control\n   over personal information about\
    \ them that may reside in a NIC\n   database, especially if the information will\
    \ be available publicly.\n   It is recommended that, as part of the process of\
    \ collecting\n   information for a database, a NIC should disclose the following\n\
    \   information to those supplying data:\n      - Why the information is being\
    \ collected and how it will be used.\n      - What the consequences are of not\
    \ providing the asked for data or\n        of revoking data in a database.\n \
    \     - Which information asked for is mandatory and which is optional.\n    \
    \  - Which information will be made public.\n      - How the data can be updated\
    \ and who may provide updates.\n      - How and how often the NIC will solicit\
    \ for data updates.\n   A NIC should actively seek updates to its data at least\
    \ once a year.\n   The date publicly available data was last updated should be\
    \ part of\n   the public information available about that data.  In general, users\n\
    \   should know when personal information about them is available in a\n   public\
    \ database, and have the opportunity to change it or revoke it.\n"

  - "9. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\n   Because NICs interact directly with network users,\
    \ they will have to\n   deal with network and host security issues at times. \
    \ NICs should be\n   aware of those agencies and groups on the Internet that have\
    \ the\n   responsibility of handling security incidents so that users can be\n\
    \   properly referred when necessary, and so the NICs themselves have\n   resources\
    \ to call on should a major incident occur.  NICs should be\n   aware of security\
    \ issues and security information resources, such as\n   network mailing lists\
    \ and the Site Security Handbook (FYI 8, RFC\n   1244), and advocate the importance\
    \ of security considerations to\n   their users.  NICs should have explicit procedures\
    \ in place to follow\n   in the event of a security incident.  Such procedures\
    \ will probably\n   include the means of interacting with both response centers\
    \ and NOCs,\n   as well as with users.\n"
