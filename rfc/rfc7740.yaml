  - "1.  Introduction\n   Section 11.2 of RFC 6513 (\"Partitioned Sets of PEs\") describes
    two\n   methods of carrying Bidirectional PIM (BIDIR-PIM) [RFC5015] C-flow\n   traffic
    over a provider core without using the core as the Rendezvous\n   Point Link (RPL)
    or requiring Designated Forwarder election.\n   With these two methods, all Provider
    Edges (PEs) of a particular VPN\n   are separated into partitions, with each partition
    being all the PEs\n   that elect the same PE as the Upstream PE with respect to
    the C-RPA\n   (the Rendezvous Point Address in the customer's address space).
    \ A PE\n   must discard bidirectional C-flow traffic from PEs that are not in\n
    \  the same partition as the PE itself.\n   In particular, Section 11.2.3 of RFC
    6513 (\"Partial Mesh of MP2MP\n   P-Tunnels\") guarantees the above discard behavior
    without using an\n   extra PE Distinguisher Label by having all PEs in the same
    partition\n   join a single MP2MP tunnel dedicated to that partition and use it
    to\n   transmit traffic.  All traffic arriving on the tunnel will be from\n   PEs
    in the same partition, so it will be always accepted.\n   RFC 6514 specifies BGP
    encodings and procedures used to implement\n   Multicast VPN (MVPN) as specified
    in RFC 6513, while the details\n   related to MP2MP tunnels are specified in [RFC7582].\n
    \  RFC 7582 assumes that an MP2MP P-tunnel is realized either via BIDIR-\n   PIM
    [RFC5015] or via MP2MP mLDP (Multipoint extensions for LDP)\n   [RFC6388].  Each
    would require signaling and state not just on PEs,\n   but on the P routers as
    well.  This document describes how the MP2MP\n   tunnel can be simulated with
    a mesh of P2MP tunnels, each of which is\n   instantiated by Ingress Replication
    (IR) [RFC6513] [RFC6514].  The\n   procedures in this document are different from
    the procedures that\n   are used to set up the mesh of Ingress Replication tunnels
    as\n   described in RFC 6514; the procedures in this document do not require\n
    \  each PE on the MP2MP tunnel to send a Selective P-Multicast Service\n   Interface
    (S-PMSI) auto-discovery route (A-D route) for the P2MP\n   tunnel that the PE
    is the root for, nor do they require each PE to\n   send a Leaf A-D route to the
    root of each P2MP tunnel in the mesh.\n   Because it uses Ingress Replication,
    this scheme has both the\n   advantages and the disadvantages of Ingress Replication
    in general.\n"

  - "2.  Operation\n   In the following sections, the originator of an S-PMSI A-D
    route or\n   Leaf A-D route is determined from the \"originating router's IP\n
    \  address\" field of the corresponding route.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Control State\n   If a PE, say PEx, is connected to a site of a given
      VPN and PEx's\n   next-hop interface to some C-RPA is a VPN Routing and Forwarding\n
      \  (VRF) interface, then PEx MUST advertise a (C-*,C-*-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D\n   route,
      regardless of whether it has any local BIDIR-PIM join states\n   corresponding
      to the C-RPA learned from its Customer Edges (CEs).  It\n   MAY also advertise
      one or more (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D routes, if\n   selective distribution
      trees are needed for those C-G-BIDIR groups\n   and the corresponding C-RPA
      is in the site that the PEx connects to.\n   For example, the (C-*,C-G-BIDIR)
      S-PMSI A-D routes could be triggered\n   when the (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) traffic rate
      goes above a threshold (this\n   may require measuring the traffic in both directions,
      due to the\n   nature of BIDIR-PIM), and fan-out could also be taken into account.\n
      \  The S-PMSI A-D routes include a PMSI Tunnel Attribute (PTA) with\n   tunnel
      type set to Ingress Replication, with the Leaf Information\n   Required flag
      set, with a downstream allocated MPLS label that other\n   PEs in the same partition
      MUST use when sending relevant C-BIDIR\n   flows to this PE, and with the Tunnel
      Identifier field in the PTA set\n   to a routable address of the originator.
      \ This specification does not\n   prevent sharing of labels between P-tunnels,
      such as a label being\n   shared by a (C-*,C-*-BIDIR) and a (C-*,C-G-BIDIR)
      S-PMSI A-D route\n   originated by a given PE (note that other specifications
      put\n   constraints on how that can be done, e.g., [MVPN-EXTRANET]).\n   If
      some other PE, PEy, receives and imports into one of its VRFs any\n   (C-*,C-*-BIDIR)
      S-PMSI A-D route whose PTA specifies an IR P-tunnel\n   and the VRF has any
      local BIDIR-PIM join state that PEy has received\n   from its CEs and if PEy
      chooses PEx as its Upstream PE with respect\n   to the C-RPA for those states,
      PEy MUST advertise a Leaf A-D route in\n   response.  Or, if PEy has received
      and imported into one of its VRFs\n   a (C-*,C-*-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route from
      PEx before, then upon\n   receiving in the VRF any local BIDIR-PIM join state
      from its CEs with\n   PEx being the Upstream PE for those states' C-RPA, PEy
      MUST advertise\n   a Leaf A-D route.\n   The encoding of the Leaf A-D route
      is as specified in RFC 6514,\n   except that the Route Targets are set to the
      same value as in the\n   corresponding S-PMSI A-D route so that the Leaf A-D
      route will be\n   imported by all VRFs that import the corresponding S-PMSI
      A-D route.\n   This is irrespective of whether or not the originator of the
      S-PMSI\n   A-D route is the Upstream PE from a receiving PE's perspective.  The\n
      \  label in the PTA of the Leaf A-D route originated by PEy MUST be\n   allocated
      specifically for PEx, so that when traffic arrives with\n   that label, the
      traffic can associate with the partition (represented\n   by the PEx).  This
      specification does not prevent sharing of labels\n   between P-tunnels, such
      as a label being shared by a (C-*,C-*-BIDIR)\n   and a (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) Leaf
      A-D route originated by a given PE (note\n   that other specifications put constraints
      on how that can be done,\n   e.g., [MVPN-EXTRANET]).\n   Note that RFC 6514
      requires that a PE or an ASBR (Autonomous System\n   Border Router) take no
      action with regard to a Leaf A-D route unless\n   that Leaf A-D route carries
      an IP-address-specific Route Target\n   identifying the PE/ASBR.  This document
      removes that requirement when\n   the route key of a Leaf A-D route identifies
      a (C-*,C-*-BIDIR) or a\n   (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI.\n   To speed up convergence
      (so that PEy starts receiving traffic from\n   its new Upstream PE immediately
      instead of waiting until the new Leaf\n   A-D route corresponding to the new
      Upstream PE is received by sending\n   PEs), PEy MAY advertise a Leaf A-D route
      even if it does not choose\n   PEx as its Upstream PE with respect to the C-RPA.
      \ With that, it will\n   receive traffic from all PEs, but some will arrive
      with the label\n   corresponding to its choice of Upstream PE while some will
      arrive\n   with a different label; the traffic in the latter case will be\n
      \  discarded.\n   Similar to the (C-*,C-*-BIDIR) case, if PEy receives and imports
      into\n   one of its VRFs any (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route whose PTA\n   specifies
      an IR P-tunnel, PEy chooses PEx as its Upstream PE with\n   respect to the C-RPA,
      and it has corresponding local (C-*,C-G-BIDIR)\n   join state that it has received
      from its CEs in the VRF, PEy MUST\n   advertise a Leaf A-D route in response.
      \ Or, if PEy has received and\n   imported into one of its VRFs a (C-*,C-G-BIDIR)
      S-PMSI A-D route\n   before, then upon receiving its local (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) join
      state from\n   its CEs in the VRF, it MUST advertise a Leaf A-D route.\n   The
      encoding of the Leaf A-D route is similar to the (C-*,C-*-BIDIR)\n   case.  Similarly,
      PEy MAY advertise a Leaf A-D route even if it does\n   not choose PEx as its
      Upstream PE with respect to the C-RPA.\n   PEy MUST withdraw the corresponding
      Leaf A-D route if any of the\n   following conditions are true:\n   o  the (C-*,C-*-BIDIR)
      or (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route is\n      withdrawn.\n   o  PEy no longer
      chooses the originator PEx as its Upstream PE with\n      respect to C-RPA and
      PEy only advertises Leaf A-D routes in\n      response to its Upstream PE's
      S-PMSI A-D route.\n   o  if relevant local join state is pruned.\n"

    - "2.2.  Forwarding State\n   The specification regarding forwarding state in
      this section matches\n   the \"When an S-PMSI is a 'Match for Transmission'\"
      and \"When an\n   S-PMSI is a 'Match for Reception'\" rules for the \"Flat Partitioning\"\n
      \  method in [RFC7582], except that the rules about (C-*,C-*) are not\n   applicable,
      because this document requires that (C-*,C-*-BIDIR)\n   S-PMSI A-D routes are
      always originated for a VPN that supports\n   C-BIDIR flows.\n   For the (C-*,C-G-BIDIR)
      S-PMSI A-D route that a PEy receives and\n   imports into one of its VRFs from
      its Upstream PE with respect to the\n   C-RPA, if PEy itself advertises the
      S-PMSI A-D route in the VRF, PEy\n   maintains a (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) forwarding
      state in the VRF, with the\n   Ingress Replication provider tunnel leaves being
      the originators of\n   the S-PMSI A-D route and all relevant Leaf A-D routes.
      \ The relevant\n   Leaf A-D routes are the routes whose Route Key field contains
      the\n   same information as the MCAST-VPN Network Layer Reachability\n   Information
      (NLRI) of the (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route advertised\n   by the Upstream
      PE.\n   For the (C-*,C-*-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route that a PEy receives and\n   imports
      into one of its VRFs from its Upstream PE with respect to a\n   C-RPA, if PEy
      itself advertises the S-PMSI A-D route in the VRF, it\n   maintains appropriate
      forwarding states in the VRF for the ranges of\n   bidirectional groups for
      which the C-RPA is responsible.  The\n   provider tunnel leaves are the originators
      of the S-PMSI A-D route\n   and all relevant Leaf A-D routes.  The relevant
      Leaf A-D routes are\n   the routes whose Route Key field contains the same information
      as the\n   MCAST-VPN NLRI of the (C-*,C-*-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route advertised
      by\n   the Upstream PE.  This is for the so-called \"Sender Only Branches\"\n
      \  where a router only has data to send upstream towards C-RPA but no\n   explicit
      join state for a particular bidirectional group.  Note that\n   the traffic
      must be sent to all PEs (not just the Upstream PE) in the\n   partition, because
      they may have specific (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) join states\n   that this PEy is not
      aware of, while there are no corresponding\n   (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D and
      Leaf A-D routes.\n   For a (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) join state that a PEy has received
      from its CEs\n   in a VRF, if there is no corresponding (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI
      A-D\n   route from its Upstream PE in the VRF, PEy maintains a corresponding\n
      \  forwarding state in the VRF, with the provider tunnel leaves being\n   the
      originators of the (C-*,C-*-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route and all\n   relevant Leaf
      A-D routes (same as the \"Sender Only Branches\" case\n   above).  The relevant
      Leaf A-D routes are the routes whose Route Key\n   field contains the same information
      as the MCAST-VPN NLRI of the\n   (C-*,C-*-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route originated
      by the Upstream PE.  If\n   there is also no (C-*,C-*-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route
      from its Upstream\n   PE, then the provider tunnel has an empty set of leaves,
      and PEy does\n   not forward relevant traffic across the provider network.\n"
