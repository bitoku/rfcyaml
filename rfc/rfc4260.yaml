  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Mobile IPv6 Fast Handover protocol [2] has been proposed\
    \ as a way\n   to minimize the interruption in service experienced by a Mobile\
    \ IPv6\n   node as it changes its point of attachment to the Internet.  Without\n\
    \   such a mechanism, a mobile node cannot send or receive packets from\n   the\
    \ time that it disconnects from one point of attachment in one\n   subnet to the\
    \ time it registers a new care-of address from the new\n   point of attachment\
    \ in a new subnet.  Such an interruption would be\n   unacceptable for real-time\
    \ services such as Voice-over-IP.\n   The basic idea behind a Mobile IPv6 fast\
    \ handover is to leverage\n   information from the link-layer technology to either\
    \ predict or\n   rapidly respond to a handover event.  This allows IP connectivity\
    \ to\n   be restored at the new point of attachment sooner than would\n   otherwise\
    \ be possible.  By tunneling data between the old and new\n   access routers,\
    \ it is possible to provide IP connectivity in advance\n   of actual Mobile IP\
    \ registration with the home agent or correspondent\n   node.  This allows real-time\
    \ services to be reestablished without\n   waiting for such Mobile IP registration\
    \ to complete.  Because Mobile\n   IP registration involves time-consuming Internet\
    \ round-trips, the\n   Mobile IPv6 fast handover can provide for a smaller interruption\
    \ in\n   real-time services than an ordinary Mobile IP handover.\n   The particular\
    \ link-layer information available, as well as the\n   timing of its availability\
    \ (before, during, or after a handover has\n   occurred), differs according to\
    \ the particular link-layer technology\n   in use.  This document gives a set\
    \ of deployment examples for Mobile\n   IPv6 Fast Handovers on 802.11 networks.\
    \  We begin with a brief\n   overview of relevant aspects of basic 802.11 [3].\
    \  We examine how and\n   when handover information might become available to\
    \ the IP layers\n   that implement Fast Handover, both in the network infrastructure\
    \ and\n   on the mobile node.  Finally, we trace the protocol steps for Mobile\n\
    \   IPv6 Fast Handover in this environment.\n"

  - "3.  Deployment Architectures for Mobile IPv6 on 802.11\n   In this section, we\
    \ describe the two most likely relationships\n   between Access Points (APs),\
    \ Access Routers (ARs), and IP subnets\n   that are possible in an 802.11 network\
    \ deployment.  In this document,\n   our focus is mainly on the infrastructure\
    \ mode [3] of 802.11.\n   Usually, a given STA is associated with one and only\
    \ one AP at any\n   given instant; however, implementations are possible [4] where\n\
    \   multiple associations per STA may be maintained as long as the APs\n   are\
    \ connected to disjoint DSs.  An STA may be in communication with\n   an AP only\
    \ when radio propagation conditions permit.  Note that, as\n   with any layer-2\
    \ technology, handover from one layer-2 point of\n   attachment (AP) to another\
    \ does not necessarily mean a change of AR\n   or subnet.\n                  AR\

    \ this figure are acting as link-layer relays, which means that\n   they transport\
    \ Ethernet-layer frames between the wireless medium and\n   the subnet.  Note\
    \ that APs do not generally implement any particular\n   spanning tree algorithm,\
    \ yet are more sophisticated than simple\n   bridges that would relay all traffic;\
    \ only traffic addressed to STAs\n   known to be associated on a given AP would\
    \ be forwarded.  Each subnet\n   is on top of a single LAN or VLAN, and we assume\
    \ in this example that\n   APs 6-10 cannot reach the VLAN on which Subnet 1 is\
    \ implemented.\n   Note that a handover from AP1 to AP2 does not require a change\
    \ of AR\n   (here we assume the STA will be placed on the same VLAN during such\
    \ a\n   handoff) because all three ARs are link-layer reachable from an STA\n\
    \   connected to any AP1-5.  Therefore, such handoffs would not require\n   IP-layer\
    \ mobility management, although some IP-layer signaling may be\n   required to\
    \ determine that connectivity to the existing AR is still\n   available.  However,\
    \ a handover from AP5 to AP6 would require a\n   change of AR, because AP6 cannot\
    \ reach the VLAN on which Subnet 1 is\n   implemented and therefore the STA would\
    \ be attaching to a different\n   subnet.  An IP-layer handover mechanism would\
    \ need to be invoked in\n   order to provide low-interruption handover between\

- title: 4.  802.11 Handovers in Detail
  contents:
  - "4.  802.11 Handovers in Detail\n   An 802.11 handover takes place when an STA\
    \ changes its association\n   from one AP to another (\"re-association\").  This\
    \ process consists of\n   the following steps:\n     0. The STA realizes that\
    \ a handoff is necessary due to degrading\n        radio transmission environment\
    \ for the current AP.\n     1. The STA performs a scan to see what APs are available.\
    \  The\n        result of the scan is a list of APs together with physical layer\n\
    \        information, such as signal strength.\n     2. The STA chooses one of\
    \ the APs and performs a join to\n        synchronize its physical and MAC-layer\
    \ timing parameters with\n        the selected AP.\n     3. The STA requests authentication\
    \ with the new AP.  For an \"Open\n        System\", such authentication is a\
    \ single round-trip message\n        exchange with null authentication.\n    \
    \ 4. The STA requests association or re-association with the new AP.\n       \
    \ A re-association request contains the MAC-layer address of the\n        old\
    \ AP, while a plain association request does not.\n     5. If operating in accordance\
    \ with 802.11i [6], the STA and AP\n        would execute 802.1X EAP-on-LAN procedures\
    \ to authenticate the\n        association (step 3 would have executed in \"Open\
    \ System\" mode).\n     6. The new AP sends a Layer 2 Update frame on the local\
    \ LAN segment\n        to update the learning tables of any connected Ethernet\
    \ bridges.\n   Although we preface step 1 with step 0 for illustration purposes,\n\
    \   there is no standardized trigger for step 1.  It may be performed as\n   a\
    \ result of decaying radio conditions on the current AP or at other\n   times\
    \ as determined by local implementation decisions.  Some network\n   interface\
    \ cards (NICs) may do scanning in the background,\n   interleaving scans between\
    \ data packets.  This decreases the time\n   required to roam if the performance\
    \ of the current AP proves\n   unsatisfactory, but it imposes more of a burden\
    \ on the AP, since\n   typically the STA places it in power-save mode prior to\
    \ the scan,\n   then once the scan is complete, returns to the AP channel in order\
    \ to\n   pick up queued packets.  This can result in buffer exhaustion on the\n\
    \   AP and attendant packet loss.\n   During step 2, the STA performs rate adjustment\
    \ where it chooses the\n   best available transmission rate.  Rate adjustment\
    \ can be quite\n   time-consuming as well as unpredictable.\n   Note that in some\
    \ existing 802.11 implementations, steps 1-4 are\n   performed by firmware in\
    \ rapid succession (note that even in these\n   implementations step 3 is sometimes\
    \ performed in a host driver,\n   especially for newer implementations).  This\
    \ might make it impossible\n   for the host to take any actions (including sending\
    \ or receiving IP\n   packets) before the handover is complete.  In other 802.11\n\
    \   implementations, it is possible to invoke the scan (step 1) and join\n   (step\
    \ 2) operations independently.  This would make it possible to,\n   e.g., perform\
    \ step 1 far in advance of the handover and perhaps in\n   advance of any real-time\
    \ traffic.  This could substantially reduce\n   the handover latency, as one study\
    \ has concluded that the 802.11\n   beacon scanning function may take several\
    \ hundred milliseconds to\n   complete [8], during which time sending and receiving\
    \ IP packets is\n   not possible.  However, scanning too far in advance may make\
    \ the\n   information out-of-date by the time of handover, which would cause\n\
    \   the subsequent joint operation to fail if radio conditions have\n   changed\
    \ so much in the interim that the target AP is no longer\n   reachable.  So, a\
    \ host may choose to do scanning based on, among\n   other considerations, the\
    \ age of the previously scanned information.\n   In general, performing such subsequent\
    \ scans is a policy issue that a\n   given implementation of FMIPv6 over 802.11\
    \ must consider carefully.\n   Even if steps 1 and 2 are performed in rapid succession,\
    \ there is no\n   guarantee that an AP found during step 1 will be available during\n\
    \   step 2 because radio conditions can change dramatically from moment\n   to\
    \ moment.  The STA may then decide to associate with a completely\n   different\
    \ AP.  Often, this decision is implemented in firmware and\n   the attached host\
    \ would have no control over which AP is chosen.\n   However, tools such as the\
    \ host AP driver [10] offer full control\n   over when and to which AP the host\
    \ needs to associate.  Operation as\n   an Independent BSS (IBSS) or \"ad-hoc\
    \ mode\" [3] may also permit the\n   necessary control, although in this latter\
    \ case attachment to an\n   infrastructure AP would be impossible.  Implementers\
    \ can make use of\n   such tools to obtain the best combination of flexibility\
    \ and\n   performance.\n   The coverage area of a single AP is known as a Basic\
    \ Service Set\n   (BSS).  An Extended Service Set (ESS) is formed from a collection\
    \ of\n   APs that all broadcast the same ESSID.  Note that an STA would send a\n\
    \   re-association (which includes both the old and new AP addresses)\n   only\
    \ if the ESSID of the old and new APs are the same.\n   A change of BSS within\
    \ an ESS may or may not require an IP-layer\n   handover, depending on whether\
    \ the APs can send packets to the same\n   IP subnets.  If an IP-layer handover\
    \ is required, then FMIPv6 can\n   decrease the overall latency of the handover.\
    \  The main goal of this\n   document is to describe the most reasonable scenarios\
    \ for how the\n   events of an 802.11 handover may interleave with the message\n\
    \   exchanges in FMIPv6.\n"
- title: 5.  FMIPv6 Message Exchanges
  contents:
  - "5.  FMIPv6 Message Exchanges\n   An FMIPv6 handover nominally consists of the\
    \ following messages:\n     a. The mobile node (MN) sends a Router Solicitation\
    \ for Proxy\n        (RtSolPr) to find out about neighboring ARs.\n     b. The\
    \ MN receives a Proxy Router Advertisement (PrRtAdv)\n        containing one or\
    \ more [AP-ID, AR-Info] tuples.\n     c. The MN sends a Fast Binding Update (FBU)\
    \ to the Previous Access\n        Router (PAR).\n     d. The PAR sends a Handover\
    \ Initiate (HI) message to the New Access\n        Router (NAR).\n     e. The\
    \ NAR sends a Handover Acknowledge (HAck) message to the PAR.\n     f. The PAR\
    \ sends a Fast Binding Acknowledgement (FBack) message to\n        the MS on the\
    \ new link.  The FBack is also optionally sent on\n        the previous link if\
    \ the FBU was sent from there.\n     g. The MN sends Fast Neighbor Advertisement\
    \ (FNA) to the NAR after\n        attaching to it.\n   The MN may connect to the\
    \ NAR prior to sending the FBU if the\n   handover is unanticipated.  In this\
    \ case, the FNA (step g) would\n   contain the FBU (listed as step c above) and\
    \ then steps d, e, and f\n   would take place from there.\n"
- title: 6.  Beacon Scanning and NAR Discovery
  contents:
  - "6.  Beacon Scanning and NAR Discovery\n   The RtSolPr message is used to request\
    \ information about the\n   router(s) connected to one or more APs.  The APs are\
    \ specified in the\n   New Access Point Link-Layer Address option in the RtSolPr\
    \ and\n   associated IP-layer information is returned in the IP Address Option\n\
    \   of the PrRtAdv [2].  In the case of an 802.11 link, the link-layer\n   address\
    \ is the BSSID of some AP.\n   Beacon scanning (step 1 from Section 4) produces\
    \ a list of available\n   APs along with signal strength information for each.\
    \  This list would\n   supply the necessary addresses for the New Access Point\
    \ Link-Layer\n   Address option(s) in the RtSolPr messages.  To obtain this list,\
    \ the\n   host needs to invoke the MLME-SCAN.request primitive (see Section\n\
    \   10.3.2.1 of the 802.11 specification [3]).  The BSSIDs returned by\n   this\
    \ primitive are the link-layer addresses of the available APs.\n   Because beacon\
    \ scanning takes on the order of a few hundred\n   milliseconds to complete, and\
    \ because it is generally not possible to\n   send and receive IP packets during\
    \ this time, the MN needs to\n   schedule these events with care so that they\
    \ do not disrupt ongoing\n   real-time services.  For example, the scan could\
    \ be performed at the\n   time the MN attaches to the network prior to any real-time\
    \ traffic.\n   However, if the interval between scanning and handover is too long,\n\
    \   the neighbor list may be out of date.  For example, the signal\n   strengths\
    \ of neighboring APs may have dramatically changed, and a\n   handover directed\
    \ to the apparently best AP from the old list may\n   fail.  If the handover is\
    \ executed in firmware, the STA may even\n   choose a new target AP that is entirely\
    \ missing from the old list\n   (after performing its own scan).  Both cases would\
    \ limit the ability\n   of the MN to choose the correct NAR for the FBU in step\
    \ c during an\n   anticipated handover.  Ongoing work in the IEEE 802.11k task\
    \ group\n   may address extensions that allow interleaving beacon scanning with\n\
    \   data transmission/reception along with buffering at APs to minimize\n   packet\
    \ loss.\n   Note that, aside from physical layer parameters such as signal\n \
    \  strength, it may be possible to obtain all necessary information\n   about\
    \ neighboring APs by using the wildcard form of the RtSolPr\n   message.  This\
    \ would cause the current access router to return a list\n   of neighboring APs\
    \ and would not interrupt ongoing communication with\n   the current AP.  This\
    \ request could be made at the time the MN first\n   attaches to the access router\
    \ and periodically thereafter. This would\n   enable the MN to cache the necessary\
    \ [AP-ID, AR-Info] tuples and\n   might enable it to react more quickly when a\
    \ handover becomes\n   necessary due to a changing radio environment.  However,\
    \ because the\n   information does not include up-to-date signal strength, it\
    \ would not\n   enable the MN to predict accurately the next AP prior to a handover.\n\
    \   Also, if the scale of the network is such that a given access router\n   is\
    \ attached to many APs, then it is possible that there may not be\n   room to\
    \ list all APs in the PrRtAdv.\n   The time taken to scan for beacons is significant\
    \ because it involves\n   iteration through all 802.11 channels and listening\
    \ on each one for\n   active beacons.  A more targeted approach would allow the\
    \ STA to\n   scan, e.g., only one or two channels of interest, which would provide\n\
    \   for much shorter interruption of real-time traffic.  However, such\n   optimizations\
    \ are currently outside the scope of 802.11\n   specifications.\n"

  - "7.  Scenarios\n   In this section, we look at a few of the possible scenarios\

    \ scan sometime\n   prior to the handover and is able to send the FBU prior to\
    \ handover.\n   Only the FNA is sent after the handover.  This mode of operation\n\
    \   requires that the scan and join operations (steps 1 and 2) can be\n   performed\
    \ separately and under host control, so that steps a-f can be\n   inserted between\
    \ 1 and 2.  As mentioned previously, such control may\n   be possible in some\
    \ implementations [10] but not in others.\n   Steps 1ab may be executed far in\
    \ advance of the handover, which would\n   remove them from the critical path.\
    \  This would minimize the service\n   interruption from beacon scanning and allow\
    \ at least one\n   RtSolPr/PrRtAdv exchange to complete so that the host has link-layer\n\
    \   information about some NARs.  Note that if steps ab were delayed\n   until\
    \ handover is imminent, there would be no guarantee that the\n   RtSolPr/PrRtAdv\
    \ exchange would complete especially in a radio\n   environment where the connection\
    \ to the old AP is deteriorating\n   rapidly.  However, if there were a long interval\
    \ between the scan and\n   the handover, then the FBU (step c) would be created\
    \ with out-of-date\n   information.  There is no guarantee that the MN will actually\
    \ attach\n   to the desired new AP after it has sent the FBU to the oAR, because\n\
    \   changing radio conditions may cause NAR to be suddenly unreachable.\n   If\
    \ this were the case, then the handover would need to devolve into\n   one of\
    \ the reactive cases given below.\n"

  - "7.3.  Scenario 123456abcdefg\n   In this scenario, the MN does not obtain any\
    \ information about the\n   NAR prior to executing the handover.  It is completely\
    \ reactive and\n   consists of soliciting a router advertisement after handover\
    \ and then\n   sending an FNA with encapsulated FBU immediately.\n   This scenario\
    \ may be appropriate when it is difficult to learn the\n   link-layer address\
    \ of the NAR prior to handover.  This may be the\n   case, e.g., if the scan primitive\
    \ is not available to the host and\n   the wildcard PrRtAdv form returns too many\
    \ results.  It may be\n   possible to skip the router advertisement/solicitation\
    \ steps (ab) in\n   some cases, if it is possible to learn the NAR's link-layer\
    \ address\n   through some other means.  In the deployment illustrated in Figure\
    \ 2,\n   this would be exactly the new AP's MAC-layer address, which can be\n\
    \   learned from the link-layer handover messages.  However, in the case\n   of\
    \ Figure 1, this information must be learned through router\n   discovery of some\
    \ form.  Also note that even in the case of Figure 2,\n   the MN must somehow\

- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations applicable to FMIPv6\
    \ are described in the\n   base FMIPv6 specification [2].  In particular, the\
    \ PAR must be\n   assured of the authenticity of the FBU before it begins to redirect\n\
    \   user traffic.  However, if the association with the new AP is not\n   protected\
    \ using mutual authentication, it may be possible for a rogue\n   AP to fool the\
    \ MN into sending an FBU to the PAR when it is not in\n   its best interest to\
    \ do so.\n   Note that step 6 from Section 4 installs layer-2 forwarding state\n\
    \   that can redirect user traffic and cause disruption of service if it\n   can\
    \ be triggered by a malicious node.\n   Note that step 3 from Section 4 could\
    \ potentially provide some\n   security; however, due to the identified weaknesses\
    \ in Wired\n   Equivalent Privacy (WEP) shared key security [9] this should not\
    \ be\n   relied upon.  Instead, the Robust Security Network [6] will require\n\
    \   the STA to undergo 802.1X Port-Based Network Access Control [5]\n   before\
    \ proceeding to steps 5 or 6. 802.1X defines a way to\n   encapsulate Extensible\
    \ Authentication Protocol (EAP) on 802 networks\n   (EAPOL, for \"EAP over LANs\"\
    ).  With this method, the client and AP\n   participate in an EAP exchange that\
    \ itself can encapsulate any of the\n   various EAP authentication methods.  The\
    \ EAPOL exchange can output a\n   Master Session Key (MSK) and Extended Master\
    \ Session Key (EMSK),\n   which can then be used to derive transient keys, which\
    \ in turn can be\n   used to encrypt/authenticate subsequent traffic.  It is possible\
    \ to\n   use 802.1X pre-authentication [6] between an STA and a target AP\n  \
    \ while the STA is associated with another AP; this would enable\n   authentication\
    \ to be done in advance of handover, which would allow\n   faster resumption of\
    \ service after roaming.  However, because EAPOL\n   frames carry only MAC-layer\
    \ instead of IP-layer addresses, this is\n   currently only specified to work\
    \ within a single VLAN, where IP-layer\n   handover mechanisms are not necessarily\
    \ needed anyway.  In the most\n   interesting case for FMIPv6 (roaming across\
    \ subnet boundaries), the\n   802.1X exchange would need to be performed after\
    \ handover to the new\n   AP.  This would introduce additional handover delay\
    \ while the 802.1X\n   exchange takes place, which may also involve round-trips\
    \ to RADIUS or\n   Diameter servers.  The EAP exchange could be avoided if a preexisting\n\
    \   Pairwise Master Key (PMK) is found between the STA and the AP, which\n   may\
    \ be the case if the STA has previously visited that AP or one that\n   shares\
    \ a common back-end infrastructure.\n   Perhaps faster cross-subnet authentication\
    \ could be achieved with the\n   use of pre-authentication using an IP-layer mechanism\
    \ that could\n   cross subnet boundaries.  To our knowledge, this sort of work\
    \ is not\n   currently under way in the IEEE.  The security considerations of\n\
    \   these new approaches would need to be carefully studied.\n"

  - "9.  Conclusions\n   The Mobile IPv6 Fast Handover specification presents a protocol\
    \ for\n   shortening the period of service interruption during a change in\n \
    \  link-layer point of attachment.  This document attempts to show how\n   this\
    \ protocol may be applied in the context of 802.11 access\n   networks.\n   Implementation\
    \ of FMIPv6 must be done in the context of a particular\n   link-layer implementation,\
    \ which must provide the triggers for the\n   FMIPv6 message flows.  For example,\
    \ the host must be notified of such\n   events as degradation of signal strength\
    \ or attachment to a new AP.\n   The particular implementation of the 802.11 hardware\
    \ and firmware may\n   dictate how FMIPv6 is able to operate.  For example, to\
    \ execute a\n   predictive handover, the scan request primitive must be available\
    \ to\n   the host and the firmware must execute join operations only under\n \
    \  host control [10], not autonomously in response to its own handover\n   criteria.\
    \  Obtaining the desired PrRtAdv and sending an FBU\n   immediately prior to handover\
    \ requires that messages be exchanged\n   over the wireless link during a period\
    \ when connectivity is\n   degrading.  In some cases, the scenario given in Section\
    \ 7.1 may not\n   complete successfully or the FBU may redirect traffic to the\
    \ wrong\n   NAR.  However, in these cases the handover may devolve to the\n  \
    \ scenario from Section 7.2 or the scenario from Section 7.3.\n   Ultimately,\
    \ falling back to basic Mobile IPv6 operation [7] and\n   sending a Binding Update\
    \ directly to the Home Agent can be used to\n   recover from any failure of the\
    \ FMIPv6 protocol.\n"
