  contents:
  - "1.1.  This Is Markdown! Or: Markup and Its Discontents\n   In computer systems,\
    \ textual data is stored and processed using a\n   continuum of techniques.  On\
    \ the one end is plain text: computer-\n   encoded text that consists only of\
    \ a sequence of code points from a\n   given standard, with no other formatting\
    \ or structural information\n   [UNICODE].  (On the other end is binary data,\
    \ which computer systems\n   store and process with bit-for-bit accuracy.) Many\
    \ of these standards\n   include control characters that are used as in-band signaling\
    \ to\n   cause effects other than the addition of a symbol (or grapheme) to\n\
    \   the text.\n   Markup offers an alternative means to encode this signaling\n\
    \   information by overloading certain graphic characters (see, e.g.,\n   [ISO646])\
    \ with additional meanings.  Therefore, markup languages\n   allow for annotating\
    \ a document in a syntactically distinguishable\n   way from the text, while keeping\
    \ the annotations printable.  Markup\n   languages are (reasonably) well-specified\
    \ and tend to follow (mostly)\n   standardized syntax rules.  Examples of formal\
    \ markup languages\n   include Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), HTML,\
    \ XML, and\n   LaTeX.  Standardized rules lead to interoperability between markup\n\
    \   processors, but they impose skill requirements on new users that lead\n  \
    \ to markup languages becoming less accessible to beginners.  These\n   rules\
    \ also reify \"validity\": content that does not conform to the\n   rules is treated\
    \ differently (i.e., is rejected) than content that\n   conforms.\n   In contrast\
    \ to formal markup languages, lightweight markup languages\n   use simple syntaxes;\
    \ they are designed to be easy for humans to enter\n   and understand with basic\
    \ text editors.  Markdown, the subject of\n   this document, began as an /informal/\
    \ plain-text formatting syntax\n   [MDSYNTAX] and Perl script HTML/XHTML processor\
    \ [MARKDOWN] targeted\n   at non-technical users using unspecialized tools, such\
    \ as plain-text\n   email clients.  [MDSYNTAX] explicitly rejects the notion of\
    \ validity:\n   there is no such thing as \"invalid\" Markdown.  If the Markdown\n\
    \   content does not result in the \"right\" output (defined as output that\n\
    \   the author wants, not output that adheres to some dictated system of\n   rules),\
    \ the expectation is that the author should continue\n   experimenting by changing\
    \ the content or the processor to achieve the\n   desired output.\n   Since its\
    \ development in 2004 [MARKDOWN], a number of web- and\n   Internet-facing applications\
    \ have incorporated Markdown into their\n   text-entry systems, frequently with\
    \ custom extensions.  Markdown has\n   thus evolved into a kind of Internet meme\
    \ [INETMEME] as different\n   communities encounter it and adapt the syntax for\
    \ their specific use\n   cases.  Markdown now represents a family of related plain-text\n\
    \   formatting syntaxes and implementations that, while broadly\n   compatible\
    \ with humans [HUMANE], are intended to produce different\n   kinds of outputs\
    \ that push the boundaries of mutual intelligibility\n   between software systems.\n\
    \   To support identifying and conveying Markdown, this document defines\n   a\
    \ media type and parameters that indicate the Markdown author's\n   intent on\
    \ how to interpret the content.  This registration draws\n   particular inspiration\
    \ from text/troff [RFC4263], which is a plain-\n   text formatting syntax for\
    \ typesetting based on tools from the 1960s\n   (\"RUNOFF\") and 1970s (\"nroff\"\
    , et al.).  In that sense, Markdown is a\n   kind of troff for modern computing.\
    \  A companion document [RFC7764]\n   provides additional Markdown background,\
    \ philosophy, local storage\n   strategies, and variant registrations (including\
    \ examples).\n"
- title: 1.2.  Markdown Is About Writing and Editing
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Markdown Is About Writing and Editing\n     \"HTML is a *publishing* format;\
    \ Markdown is a *writing* format.\n      Thus, Markdown's formatting syntax only\
    \ addresses issues that can\n      be conveyed in plain text.\" [MDSYNTAX]\n \
    \  The paradigmatic use case for text/markdown is the Markdown editor:\n   an\
    \ application that presents Markdown content (which looks like an\n   email or\
    \ other piece of plain-text writing) alongside a published\n   format, so that\
    \ an author can see results instantaneously and can\n   tweak his or her input\
    \ in real time.  A significant number of\n   Markdown editors have adopted \"\
    split-screen view\" (or \"live preview\")\n   technology that looks like Figure\
    \ 1.\n"

- title: 2.  Markdown Media Type Registration Application
  contents:
  - "2.  Markdown Media Type Registration Application\n   This section provides the\
    \ media type registration application for the\n   text/markdown media type (see\
    \ Section 5.6 of [RFC6838]).\n   Type name: text\n   Subtype name: markdown\n\
    \   Required parameters:\n      charset: Per Section 4.2.1 of [RFC6838], charset\
    \ is REQUIRED.\n         There is no default value because neither [MDSYNTAX]\
    \ nor many\n         popular implementations at the time of this registration\
    \ do\n         either.  [MDSYNTAX] clearly describes Markdown as a \"writing\n\
    \         format\"; its syntax rules operate on characters (specifically,\n  \
    \       on punctuation) rather than code points.  Many Markdown\n         processors\
    \ will get along just fine by operating on characters\n         in the US-ASCII\
    \ repertoire (specifically punctuation),\n         blissfully oblivious to other\
    \ characters or codes.\n   Optional parameters:\n      variant: An optional identifier\
    \ of the specific Markdown variant\n         that the author intended.  The value\
    \ serves as a \"hint\" to the\n         recipient, meaning that the recipient\
    \ MAY interpret the\n         Markdown as that variant, but is under no obligation\
    \ to do so.\n         When omitted, there is no hint; the interpretation is entirely\n\
    \         up to the receiver and context.  This identifier is plain US-\n    \
    \     ASCII and case-insensitive.  To promote interoperability,\n         identifiers\
    \ can be registered in the registry defined in\n         Section 6.  If a receiver\
    \ does not recognize the variant\n         identifier, the receiver MAY present\
    \ the identifier to a user\n         to inform him or her of it.\n         Other\
    \ parameters MAY be included with the media type.  The\n         variant SHOULD\
    \ define the semantics of such other parameters.\n         Additionally, the variant\
    \ MAY be registered under another media\n         type; this text/markdown registration\
    \ does not preclude other\n         registrations.\n   Encoding considerations:\n\
    \      Markdown content is plain-text content; any octet sequence is\n      valid\
    \ as long as it conforms to the character codes of the charset\n      parameter.\
    \  See [RFC2046].  Markup characters in [MDSYNTAX] are\n      limited to printable\
    \ US-ASCII; however, other variants can define\n      markup characters outside\
    \ this range (including control characters\n      such as NUL and characters encoded\
    \ in multiple octets).\n   Security considerations:\n      Markdown interpreted\
    \ as plain text is relatively harmless.  A text\n      editor need only display\
    \ the text.  The editor SHOULD take care to\n      handle control characters appropriately\
    \ and to limit the effect of\n      the Markdown to the text-editing area itself;\
    \ malicious Unicode-\n      based Markdown could, for example, surreptitiously\
    \ change the\n      directionality of the text.  An editor for normal text would\n\
    \      already take these control characters into consideration, however.\n  \
    \    Markdown interpreted as a precursor to other formats, such as\n      HTML,\
    \ carries all of the security considerations as the target\n      formats.  For\
    \ example, HTML can contain instructions to execute\n      scripts, redirect the\
    \ user to other web pages, download remote\n      content, and upload personally\
    \ identifiable information.  Markdown\n      also can contain islands of formal\
    \ markup, such as HTML.  These\n      islands of formal markup may be passed as\
    \ they are, transformed,\n      or ignored (perhaps because the islands are conditional\
    \ or\n      incompatible) when the Markdown is processed.  Since Markdown may\n\
    \      have different interpretations depending on the tool and the\n      environment,\
    \ a better approach is to analyze (and sanitize or\n      block) the output markup,\
    \ rather than attempting to analyze the\n      Markdown.\n   Interoperability\
    \ considerations:\n      Markdown variations (some might say \"innovations\")\
    \ are designed to\n      be broadly compatible with humans (\"humane\"), but not\
    \ necessarily\n      with each other.  Therefore, syntax in one Markdown derivative\
    \ may\n      be ignored or treated differently in another derivative.  The\n \
    \     overall effect is a general degradation of the output that\n      increases\
    \ with the quantity of variant-specific Markdown used in\n      the text.  When\
    \ it is desirable to reflect the author's intent in\n      the output, stick with\
    \ the variant identified in the variant\n      parameter, i.e., receivers SHOULD\
    \ only accept Markdown variants\n      that they explicitly know about, and senders\
    \ SHOULD avoid use of\n      variants that intended recipients are not known to\
    \ understand.\n   Published specification: This specification; [MDSYNTAX].\n \
    \  Applications that use this media type:\n      Markdown conversion tools, Markdown\
    \ WYSIWYG (What You See is What\n      You Get) editors, and plain-text editors\
    \ and viewers; markup\n      processor targets indirectly use Markdown (e.g.,\

- title: 3.  Fragment Identifiers
  contents:
  - "3.  Fragment Identifiers\n   [MARKDOWN] does not define any fragment identifiers,\
    \ but some\n   variants do, and many types of Markdown processor output (e.g.,\
    \ HTML\n   or PDF) will have well-defined fragment identifiers.  Which fragment\n\
    \   identifiers are available for a given document are variant-defined.\n   When\
    \ encoded in a URI, characters that are outside of the fragment\n   production\
    \ of [RFC3986] are percent-encoded.  The default encoding\n   (character set)\
    \ of percent-encoded octets in URIs is the same as the\n   Markdown content, which\
    \ is identified by the charset parameter or by\n   other contextual means.  Fragment\
    \ identifiers SHOULD be considered\n   case-sensitive, which maintains consistency\
    \ with HTML.  Variants MAY\n   override the guidance in this paragraph.\n   At\
    \ least the first equals sign \"=\" SHOULD be percent-encoded to\n   prevent ambiguity\
    \ as described in the following section.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Parameters
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Parameters\n   Similar to application/pdf [RFC3778] and text/plain [RFC5147],\
    \ this\n   registration permits a parameter syntax for fragment identifiers.\n\
    \   The syntax is a parameter name, the equals sign \"=\" (which MUST NOT\n  \
    \ be percent-encoded), and a parameter value.  To the extent that\n   multiple\
    \ parameters can appear in a fragment production, the\n   parameters SHALL be\
    \ separated by the ampersand \"&\" (which MUST NOT be\n   percent-encoded).\n\
    \   The only parameter defined in this registration is \"line\", which has\n \
    \  the same meaning as in [RFC5147], i.e., counting is zero-based.  For\n   example:\
    \ \"#line=10\" identifies the eleventh line of Markdown input.\n   Implementers\
    \ should take heed that different environments and\n   character sets may have\
    \ a wide range of code sequences to divide\n   lines.\n   Markdown variants are\
    \ free to define additional parameters.\n"
- title: 4.  Content Disposition and preview-type
  contents:
  - "4.  Content Disposition and preview-type\n   The Content-Disposition header [RFC2183]\
    \ conveys presentational\n   information about a MIME entity, using a type and\
    \ set of parameters.\n   The parameter preview-type is defined here for Markdown\
    \ content.\n   When present, preview-type indicates the Internet media type (and\n\
    \   parameters) of the preview output desired from the processor by the\n   author.\
    \  With reference to the \"paradigmatic use case\" (i.e.,\n   collaborative Markdown\
    \ editing) in Section 1.3, the preview-type\n   parameter primarily affects the\
    \ \"right-hand\" side of a Markdown\n   editor.  There is no default value: when\
    \ absent, a Markdown user\n   agent can render or display whatever it wants.\n\
    \   The value of this parameter is an Internet media type with optional\n   parameters.\
    \  The syntax (including case-sensitivity considerations)\n   is the same as specified\
    \ in [RFC2045] for the Content-Type header\n   (with updates over time, e.g.,\
    \ [RFC2231] and [RFC6532]).\n   Implementations SHOULD anticipate and support\
    \ HTML (text/html) and\n   XHTML (application/xhtml+xml) output, to the extent\
    \ that a syntax\n   targets those markup languages.  These types ought to be suitable\
    \ for\n   the majority of current purposes.  However, Markdown is increasingly\n\
    \   becoming integral to workflows where HTML is not the target output;\n   examples\
    \ range from TeX, to PDF, to Outline Processor Markup Language\n   (OPML), and\
    \ even to entire e-books (e.g., [PANDOC]).\n   The reflexive media type text/markdown\
    \ in this parameter value means\n   that the author does not want to invoke Markdown\
    \ processing at all:\n   the receiver SHOULD present the Markdown source as is.\n\
    \   The preview-type parameter can be used for other types of content,\n   but\
    \ the precise semantics are not defined here.\n"

    \   media type, the registry is intended for broad community use, so\n   protocols\
    \ and systems that do not rely on Internet media types can\n   still tag Markdown\
    \ content with a common variant identifier.  Each\n   entry in this registry shall\
    \ consist of basic information about the\n   variant:\n   Identifier:        \
    \     unique identifier for the variant\n   Name:                   the commonly\

    \ start with a letter and MAY contain\n   punctuation in the middle, but not at\
    \ the end: the last character\n   MUST be alphanumeric.  The second production\
    \ uses the same characters\n   as the \"unreserved\" rule of [RFC3986] and is\
    \ designed to be\n   compatible with characters in other identification systems,\
    \ e.g.,\n   filenames.  Since the identifier MAY be displayed to a user --\n \
    \  particularly in cases where the receiver does not recognize the\n   identifier\
    \ -- the identifier SHOULD be rationally related to the\n   vernacular name of\
    \ the variant.\n   The Name, Description, Additional Parameters, Fragment Identifiers,\n\
