  - "Abstract\n   Global IPv6 deployment was slower than originally expected.  As\
    \ IPv4\n   address exhaustion approaches, IPv4 to IPv6 transition issues become\n\
    \   more critical and less tractable.  Host-based transition mechanisms\n   used\
    \ in dual-stack environments cannot meet all transition\n   requirements.  Most\
    \ end users are not sufficiently expert to\n   configure or maintain host-based\
    \ transition mechanisms.  Carrier-\n   Grade NAT (CGN) devices with integrated\
    \ transition mechanisms can\n   reduce the operational changes required during\
    \ the IPv4 to IPv6\n   migration or coexistence period.\n   This document proposes\
    \ an incremental CGN approach for IPv6\n   transition.  It can provide IPv6 access\
    \ services for IPv6 hosts and\n   IPv4 access services for IPv4 hosts while leaving\
    \ much of a legacy\n   ISP network unchanged during the initial stage of IPv4\
    \ to IPv6\n   migration.  Unlike CGN alone, incremental CGN also supports and\n\
    \   encourages smooth transition towards dual-stack or IPv6-only ISP\n   networks.\
    \  An integrated configurable CGN device and an adaptive home\n   gateway (HG)\
    \ device are described.  Both are reusable during\n   different transition phases,\
    \ avoiding multiple upgrades.  This\n   enables IPv6 migration to be incrementally\
    \ achieved according to real\n   user requirements.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Global IPv6 deployment did not happen as was forecast 10\
    \ years ago.\n   Network providers were hesitant to make the first move while\
    \ IPv4 was\n   and is still working well.  However, IPv4 address exhaustion is\n\
    \   imminent.  The dynamically updated IPv4 Address Report [IPUSAGE] has\n   analyzed\
    \ this issue. IANA unallocated address pool exhaustion\n   occurred in February\
    \ 2011, and at the time of publication, the site\n   predicts imminent exhaustion\
    \ for Regional Internet Registry (RIR)\n   unallocated address pools.  Based on\
    \ this fact, the Internet industry\n   appears to have reached consensus that\
    \ global IPv6 deployment is\n   inevitable and has to be done expeditiously.\n\
    \   IPv4 to IPv6 transition issues therefore become more critical and\n   complicated\
    \ for the approaching global IPv6 deployment.  Host-based\n   transition mechanisms\
    \ alone are not able to meet the requirements in\n   all cases.  Therefore, network-based\
    \ supporting functions and/or new\n   transition mechanisms with simple user-side\
    \ operation are needed.\n   Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) [CGN-REQS], also called NAT444\
    \ CGN or Large\n   Scale NAT, compounds IPv4 operational problems when used alone\
    \ but\n   does nothing to encourage IPv4 to IPv6 transition.  Deployment of\n\
    \   NAT444 CGN allows ISPs to delay the transition and therefore causes\n   double\
    \ transition costs (once to add CGN and again to support IPv6).\n   CGN deployments\
    \ that integrate multiple transition mechanisms can\n   simplify the operation\
    \ of end-user services during the IPv4 to IPv6\n   migration and coexistence periods.\
    \  CGNs are deployed on the network\n   side and managed/maintained by professionals.\
    \  On the user side, new\n   home gateway (HG) devices may be needed too.  They\
    \ may be provided by\n   network providers, depending on the specific business\
    \ model.  Dual-\n   stack lite [DS-LITE], also called DS-Lite, is a CGN-based\
    \ solution\n   that supports transition, but it requires the ISP to upgrade its\n\
    \   network to IPv6 immediately.  Many ISPs hesitate to do this as the\n   first\
    \ step.  Theoretically, DS-Lite can be used with double\n   encapsulation (IPv4-in-IPv6-in-IPv4),\
    \ but this seems even less likely\n   to be accepted by an ISP and is not discussed\
    \ in this document.\n   This document proposes an incremental CGN approach for\
    \ IPv6\n   transition.  It does not define any new protocols or mechanisms but\n\
    \   describes how to combine existing proposals in an incremental\n   deployment.\
    \  The approach is similar to DS-Lite but the other way\n   around.  It mainly\
    \ combines v4-v4 NAT with v6-over-v4 tunneling\n   functions.  It can provide\
    \ IPv6 access services for IPv6-enabled\n   hosts and IPv4 access services for\
    \ IPv4 hosts while leaving most of\n   legacy IPv4 ISP networks unchanged.  The\
    \ deployment of this\n   technology does not affect legacy IPv4 hosts with global\
    \ IPv4\n   addresses at all.  It is suitable for the initial stage of IPv4 to\n\
    \   IPv6 migration.  It also supports transition towards dual-stack or\n   IPv6-only\
    \ ISP networks.\n   A smooth transition mechanism is also described in this document.\
    \  It\n   introduces an integrated configurable CGN device and an adaptive HG\n\
    \   device.  Both CGN and HG are reusable devices during different\n   transition\
    \ periods, so they do not need to be replaced as the\n   transition proceeds.\
    \  This enables IPv6 migration to be incrementally\n   achieved according to the\
    \ real user requirements.\n"
- title: 2.  An Incremental CGN Approach
  contents:
  - "2.  An Incremental CGN Approach\n   Today, most consumers primarily use IPv4.\
    \  Network providers are\n   starting to provide IPv6 access services for end\
    \ users.  At the\n   initial stage of IPv4 to IPv6 migration, IPv4 connectivity\
    \ and\n   traffic would continue to represent the majority of traffic for most\n\
    \   ISP networks.  ISPs would like to minimize the changes to their IPv4\n   networks.\
    \  Switching the whole ISP network into IPv6-only would be\n   considered a radical\
    \ strategy.  Switching the whole ISP network to\n   dual-stack is less radical\
    \ but introduces operational costs and\n   complications.  Although some ISPs\
    \ have successfully deployed dual-\n   stack networks, others prefer not to do\
    \ this as their first step in\n   IPv6.  However, they currently face two urgent\
    \ pressures -- to\n   compensate for an immediate shortage of IPv4 addresses by\
    \ deploying\n   some method of address sharing and to prepare actively for the\
    \ use of\n   deployment of IPv6 address space and services.  ISPs facing only\
    \ one\n   pressure out of two could adopt either CGN (for shortage of IPv4\n \
    \  addresses) or 6rd (to provide IPv6 connectivity services).  The\n   approach\
    \ described in this document is intended to address both of\n   these pressures\
    \ at the same time by combining v4-v4 CGN with v6-over-\n   v4 tunneling technologies.\n"

    \ CGN Approach with IPv4 ISP Network\n   DS HG = Dual-Stack Home Gateway (CPE\
    \ - Customer Premises Equipment).\n   As shown in the figure above, the ISP has\
    \ not significantly changed\n   its IPv4 network.  This approach enables IPv4\
    \ hosts to access the\n   IPv4 Internet and IPv6 hosts to access the IPv6 Internet.\
    \  A dual-\n   stack host is treated as an IPv4 host when it uses IPv4 access\n\
    \   service and as an IPv6 host when it uses an IPv6 access service.  In\n   order\
    \ to enable IPv4 hosts to access the IPv6 Internet and IPv6 hosts\n   to access\
    \ IPv4 Internet, NAT64 can be integrated with the CGN; see\n   Section 2.6 for\
    \ details regarding IPv4/IPv6 intercommunication.  The\n   integration of such\
    \ mechanisms is out of scope for this document.\n   Two types of devices need\
    \ to be deployed in this approach: a dual-\n   stack home gateway (HG) and a dual-stack\
    \ CGN.  The dual-stack home\n   gateway integrates both IPv6 and IPv4 forwarding\
    \ and v6-over-v4\n   tunneling functions.  It should follow the requirements of\
    \ [RFC6204],\n   including IPv6 prefix delegation.  It may also integrate v4-v4\
    \ NAT\n   functionality.  The dual-stack CGN integrates v6-over-v4 tunneling\n\
    \   and v4-v4 CGN functions as well as standard IPv6 and IPv4 routing.\n   The\
    \ approach does not require any new mechanisms for IP packet\n   forwarding or\
    \ encapsulation or decapsulation at tunnel endpoints.\n   The following sections\
    \ describe how the HG and the incremental CGN\n   interact.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Choice of Tunneling Technology
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Choice of Tunneling Technology\n   In principle, this model will work with\
    \ any form of tunnel between\n   the dual-stack HG and the dual-stack CGN.  However,\
    \ tunnels that\n   require individual configuration are clearly undesirable because\
    \ of\n   their operational cost.  Configured tunnels based directly on\n   [RFC4213]\
    \ are therefore not suitable.  A tunnel broker according to\n   [RFC3053] would\
    \ also have high operational costs and be unsuitable\n   for home users.\n   6rd\
    \ [RFC5569, RFC5969] technology appears suitable to support\n   v6-over-v4 tunneling\
    \ with low operational cost.  Generic Routing\n   Encapsulation (GRE) [RFC2784]\
    \ with an additional auto-configuration\n   mechanism is also able to support\
    \ v6-over-v4 tunneling.  Other\n   tunneling mechanisms such as 6over4 [RFC2529],\
    \ 6to4 [RFC3056], the\n   Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP)\
    \ [RFC5214],\n   or Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET) [RFC5558] could be considered.\n\
    \   If the ISP has an entirely MPLS infrastructure between the HG and the\n  \
    \ dual-stack CGN, it would also be possible to use a IPv6 Provider Edge\n   (6PE)\
    \ [RFC4798] tunnel directly over MPLS.  This would, however, only\n   be suitable\
    \ for an advanced HG that is unlikely to be found as a\n   consumer device and\
    \ is not further discussed here.  To simplify the\n   discussion, we assume the\
    \ use of 6rd.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Behavior of Dual-Stack Home Gateway
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Behavior of Dual-Stack Home Gateway\n   When a dual-stack home gateway\
    \ receives a data packet from a host, it\n   will determine whether the packet\
    \ is an IPv4 or IPv6 packet.  The\n   packet will be handled by an IPv4 or IPv6\
    \ stack as appropriate.  For\n   IPv4, and in the absence of v4-v4 NAT on the\
    \ HG, the stack will\n   simply forward the packet to the CGN, which will normally\
    \ be the IPv4\n   default router.  If v4-v4 NAT is enabled, the HG translates\
    \ the\n   packet source address from an HG-scope private IPv4 address into a\n\
    \   CGN-scope IPv4 address, performs port mapping if needed, and then\n   forwards\
    \ the packet towards the CGN.  The HG records the v4-v4\n   address and port mapping\
    \ information for inbound packets, like any\n   other NAT.\n   For IPv6, the HG\
    \ needs to encapsulate the data into an IPv4 tunnel\n   packet, which has the\
    \ dual-stack CGN as the IPv4 destination.  The HG\n   sends the new IPv4 packet\
    \ towards the CGN, for example, using 6rd.\n   If the HG is linked to more than\
    \ one CGN, it will record the mapping\n   information between the tunnel and the\
    \ source IPv6 address for\n   inbound packets.  Detailed considerations for the\
    \ use of multiple\n   CGNs by one HG are for further study.\n   IPv4 packets from\
    \ the CGN and encapsulated IPv6 packets from the CGN\n   will be translated or\
    \ decapsulated according to the stored mapping\n   information and forwarded to\
    \ the customer side of the HG.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Behavior of Dual-Stack CGN
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Behavior of Dual-Stack CGN\n   When a dual-stack CGN receives an IPv4 data\
    \ packet from a dual-stack\n   home gateway, it will determine whether the packet\
    \ is a normal IPv4\n   packet, which is non-encapsulated, or a v6-over-v4 tunnel\
    \ packet\n   addressed to a tunnel endpoint within the CGN.  For a normal IPv4\n\
    \   packet, the CGN translates the packet source address from a CGN-scope\n  \
    \ IPv4 address into a public IPv4 address, performs port mapping if\n   necessary,\
    \ and then forwards it normally to the IPv4 Internet.  The\n   CGN records the\
    \ v4-v4 address and port mapping information for\n   inbound packets, just like\
    \ a normal NAT does.  For a v6-over-v4\n   tunnel packet, the tunnel endpoint\
    \ within the CGN will decapsulate it\n   into the original IPv6 packet and then\
    \ forward it to the IPv6\n   Internet.  The CGN records the mapping information\
    \ between the tunnel\n   and the source IPv6 address for inbound packets.\n  \
    \ Depending on the deployed location of the CGN, it may use a further\n   v6-over-v4\
    \ tunnel to connect to the IPv6 Internet.\n   Packets from the IPv4 Internet will\
    \ be appropriately translated by\n   the CGN and forwarded to the HG, and packets\
    \ from the IPv6 Internet\n   will be tunneled to the appropriate HG, using the\

- title: 2.6.  IPv4/IPv6 Intercommunication
  contents:
  - "2.6.  IPv4/IPv6 Intercommunication\n   For obvious commercial reasons, IPv6-only\
    \ public services are not\n   expected as long as there is a significant IPv4-only\
    \ customer base in\n   the world.  However, IPv4/IPv6 intercommunication may become\
    \ an issue\n   in many scenarios.\n   The IETF is expected to standardize a recommended\
    \ IPv4/IPv6\n   translation algorithm, sometimes referred to as NAT64.  It is\n\
    \   specified in the following:\n   o  \"Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation\"\
    \ [RFC6144]\n   o  \"IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators\" [RFC6052]\n  \
    \ o  \"DNS64: DNS Extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6\n     \
    \ Clients to IPv4 Servers\" [RFC6147]\n   o  \"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm\"\
    \ [RFC6145]\n   o  \"Stateful NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation\
    \ from\n      IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers\" [RFC6146]\n   o  \"An FTP ALG for\
    \ IPv6-to-IPv4 Translation\" [FTP-ALG]\n   The service, as described in the IETF's\
    \ \"Guidelines for Using IPv6\n   Transition Mechanisms during IPv6 Deployment\"\
    \ [RFC6180], provides for\n   stateless translation between hosts in an IPv4-only\
    \ domain or hosts\n   that offer an IPv4-only service and hosts with an IPv4-embedded\
    \ IPv6\n   address in an IPv6-only domain.  It additionally provides access from\n\
    \   IPv6 hosts with general format addresses to hosts in an IPv4-only\n   domain\
    \ or hosts that offer an IPv4-only service.  It does not provide\n   any-to-any\
    \ translation.  One result is that client-only hosts in the\n   IPv6 domain gain\
    \ access to IPv4 services through stateful\n   translation.  Another result is\
    \ that the IPv6 network operator has\n   the option of moving servers into the\
    \ IPv6-only domain while\n   retaining accessibility for IPv4-only clients through\
    \ stateless\n   translation of an IPv4-embedded IPv6 address.\n   Also, \"Architectural\
    \ Implications of NAT\" [RFC2993] applies across\n   the service just as in IPv4/IPv4\
    \ translation: apart from the fact\n   that a system with an IPv4-embedded IPv6\
    \ address is reachable across\n   the NAT, which is unlike IPv4, any assumption\
    \ on the application's\n   part that a local address is meaningful to a remote\
    \ peer and any use\n   of an IP address literal in the application payload is\
    \ a source of\n   service issues.  In general, the recommended mitigation for\
    \ this is\n   as follows:\n   o  Ideally, applications should use DNS names rather\
    \ than IP address\n      literals in URLs, URIs, and referrals, and in general\
    \ be network\n      layer agnostic.\n   o  If they do not, the network may provide\
    \ a relay or proxy that\n      straddles the domains.  For example, an SMTP Mail\
    \ Transfer Agent\n      (MTA) with both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity handles IPv4/IPv6\n\
    \      translation cleanly at the application layer.\n"
- title: 2.7.  Discussion
  contents:
  - "2.7.  Discussion\n   For IPv4 traffic, the incremental CGN approach inherits\
    \ all the\n   problems of CGN address-sharing techniques [ADDR-ISSUES] (e.g.,\n\
    \   scaling and the difficulty of supporting well-known ports for inbound\n  \
    \ traffic).  Application-layer problems created by double NAT are\n   beyond the\
    \ scope of this document.\n   For IPv6 traffic, a user behind the DS HG will see\

    \ of IPv6 traffic or excessive IPv6 path MTU discovery\n   interactions.  This,\
    \ and the absence of NAT problems for IPv6, will\n   create an incentive for users\
    \ and application service providers to\n   prefer IPv6.\n   ICMP filtering [RFC4890]\
    \ may be included as part of CGN functions.\n"
- title: 3.  Smooth Transition towards IPv6 Infrastructure
  contents:
  - "3.  Smooth Transition towards IPv6 Infrastructure\n   Transition from pure NAT444\
    \ CGN or 6rd to the incremental CGN\n   approach is straightforward.  The HG and\
    \ CGN devices and their\n   locations do not have to be changed; only software\
    \ upgrading may be\n   needed.  In the ideal model, described below, even software\
    \ upgrading\n   is not necessary; reconfiguration of the devices is enough.  NAT444\n\
    \   CGN solves the public address shortage issues in the current IPv4\n   infrastructure.\
    \  However, it does not contribute towards IPv6\n   deployment at all.  The incremental\
    \ CGN approach can inherit NAT444\n   CGN functions while providing overlay IPv6\
    \ services.  6rd mechanisms\n   can also transform smoothly into this incremental\
    \ CGN model.\n   However, the home gateways need to be upgraded correspondingly\
    \ to\n   perform the steps described below\n   The incremental CGN can also easily\
    \ be transitioned to an IPv6-\n   enabled infrastructure, in which the ISP network\
    \ is either dual-stack\n   or IPv6-only.\n   If the ISP prefers to move to dual-stack\
    \ routing, the HG should\n   simply switch off its v6-over-v4 function when it\
    \ observes native\n   IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) or DHCPv6 traffic and then\
    \ forward\n   both IPv6 and IPv4 traffic directly while the dual-stack CGN keeps\n\
    \   only its v4-v4 NAT function.\n   However, we expect ISPs to choose the approach\
    \ described as\n   incremental CGN here because they intend to avoid dual-stack\
    \ routing\n   and to move incrementally from IPv4-only routing to IPv6-only\n\
    \   routing.  In this case, the ideal model for the incremental CGN\n   approach\
    \ is that of an integrated configurable CGN device and an\n   adaptive HG device.\
    \  The integrated CGN device will be able to\n   support multiple functions, including\
    \ NAT444 CGN, 6rd router (or an\n   alternative tunneling mechanism), DS-Lite,\
    \ and dual-stack forwarding.\n   The HG has to integrate the corresponding functions\
    \ and be able to\n   detect relevant incremental changes on the CGN side.  Typically,\
    \ the\n   HG will occasionally poll the CGN to discover which features are\n \
    \  operational.  For example, starting from a pure IPv4-only scenario\n   (in\
    \ which the HG treats the CGN only as an IPv4 default router), the\n   HG would\
    \ discover (by infrequent polling) when 6rd became available.\n   The home user\
    \ would then acquire an IPv6 prefix.  At a later stage,\n   the HG would observe\
    \ the appearance of native IPv6 Route\n   Advertisement messages or DHCPv6 messages\
    \ to discover the\n   availability of an IPv6 service including DS-Lite.  Thus,\
    \ when an ISP\n   decides to switch from incremental CGN to DS-Lite CGN, only\
    \ a\n   configuration change or a minor software update is needed on the\n   CGNs.\
    \  The home gateway would detect this change and switch\n   automatically to DS-Lite\
    \ mode.  The only impact on the home user will\n   be to receive a different IPv6\
    \ prefix.\n   In the smooth transition model, both CGN and HG are reusable devices\n\
    \   during different transition periods.  This avoids potential multiple\n   upgrades.\
    \  Different regions of the same ISP network may be at\n   different stages of\
    \ the incremental process, using identical\n   equipment but with different configurations\
    \ of the incremental CGN\n   devices in each region.  Thus, IPv6 migration may\
    \ be incrementally\n   achieved according to the real ISP and customer requirements.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Security issues associated with NAT have been\
    \ documented in [RFC2663]\n   and [RFC2993].  Security issues for large-scale\
    \ address sharing,\n   including CGN, are discussed in [ADDR-ISSUES].  The present\n\
    \   specification does not introduce any new features to CGN itself and\n   hence\
    \ no new security considerations.  Security issues for 6rd are\n   documented\
    \ in [RFC5569] and [RFC5969], and those for DS-Lite are\n   discussed in [DS-LITE].\n\
    \   Since the tunnels proposed here exist entirely within a single ISP\n   network\
    \ between the HG/CPE and the CGN, the threat model is\n   relatively simple. \
    \ [RFC4891] describes how to protect tunnels using\n   IPsec, but an ISP could\
    \ reasonably deem its infrastructure to provide\n   adequate security without\
    \ the additional protection and overhead of\n   IPsec.  The intrinsic risks of\
    \ tunnels are described in [RFC6169],\n   which recommends that tunneled traffic\
    \ should not cross border\n   routers.  The incremental CGN approach respects\
    \ this recommendation.\n   To avoid other risks caused by tunnels, it is important\
    \ that any\n   security mechanisms based on packet inspection and any implementation\n\
    \   of ingress filtering are applied to IPv6 packets after they have been\n  \
    \ decapsulated by the CGN.  The dual-stack home gateway will need to\n   provide\
    \ basic security functionality for IPv6 [RFC6092].  Other\n   aspects are described\
    \ in [RFC4864].\n"
