  - "DISCUSSION\n   Twas the night before start-up and all through the net,\n    \
    \ not a packet was moving; no bit nor octet.\n   The engineers rattled their cards\
    \ in despair,\n     hoping a bad chip would blow with a flare.\n   The salesmen\
    \ were nestled all snug in their beds,\n     while visions of data nets danced\
    \ in their heads.\n   And I with my datascope tracings and dumps\n     prepared\
    \ for some pretty bad bruises and lumps.\n   When out in the hall there arose\
    \ such a clatter,\n     I sprang from my desk to see what was the matter.\n  \
    \ There stood at the threshold with PC in tow,\n     An ARPANET hacker, all ready\
    \ to go.\n   I could see from the creases that covered his brow,\n     he'd conquer\
    \ the crisis confronting him now.\n   More rapid than eagles, he checked each\
    \ alarm\n     and scrutinized each for its potential harm.\n   On LAPB, on OSI,\
    \ X.25!\n     TCP, SNA, V.35!\n   His eyes were afire with the strength of his\
    \ gaze;\n     no bug could hide long; not for hours or days.\n   A wink of his\
    \ eye and a twitch of his head,\n     soon gave me to know I had little to dread.\n\
    \   He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,\n     fixing a net that\
    \ had gone plumb berserk;\n   And laying a finger on one suspect line,\n     he\
    \ entered a patch and the net came up fine!\n   The packets flowed neatly and\
    \ protocols matched;\n     the hosts interfaced and shift-registers latched.\n\
    \   He tested the system from Gateway to PAD;\n     not one bit was dropped; no\
    \ checksum was bad.\n   At last he was finished and wearily sighed\n"
