- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The format of an MPLS label stack entry is defined by RFC\
    \ 3032\n   [RFC3032] to include a three-bit field called the \"EXP field\".  The\n\
    \   exact use of this field is not defined by RFC 3032, except to state\n   that\
    \ it is to be \"reserved for experimental use\".\n   The EXP field, from the start,\
    \ was intended to carry \"Class of\n   Service\" (CoS) information.  The field\
    \ was actually called the \"Class\n   of Service field\" in early versions of\
    \ the working group document\n   that was published as RFC 3032.  However, at\
    \ the time that RFC 3032\n   was published, the exact usage of this \"Class of\
    \ Service\" field was\n   not agreed upon and the field was designated as \"experimental\
    \ use\";\n   hence, the name has since been the \"EXP field\".\n   The designation\
    \ \"for experimental use\" has led other Standards\n   Development Organizations\
    \ (SDOs) and implementors to assume that it\n   is possible to use the field for\
    \ other purposes.  This document\n   changes the name of the field to clearly\
    \ indicate its use as a\n   traffic classification field.\n   At first, we discussed\
    \ using the original \"CoS field\" as the name for\n   the field, but it has been\
    \ pointed out that this name does not cover\n   the following changes that have\
    \ occurred with respect to its usage\n   since RFC 3032 was published.\n   1.\
    \  The use of the EXP field was first defined in RFC 3270 [RFC3270],\n       where\
    \ a method to define a variant of Diffserv Label Switched\n       Paths (LSP),\
    \ called EXP-Inferred-PSC LSP (E-LSPs), was specified.\n       PSC is a two-stage\
    \ acronym that is expanded as PHB (Per Hop\n       Behavior) Scheduling Class\
    \ (PSC).\n   2.  The use of the EXP field as defined in RFC 3270 has been further\n\
    \       extended in RFC 5129 [RFC5129], where methods for explicit\n       congestion\
    \ marking in MPLS are defined.\n   This document, hence, uses the name \"Traffic\
    \ Class field (TC field)\",\n   which better covers the potential use.  The MPLS\
    \ TC field relates to\n   an MPLS encapsulated packet the same way as the IPv6\
    \ TC field relates\n   to an IPv6 encapsulated packet or the IPv4 Precedence field\
    \ relates\n   to an IPv4 encapsulated packet.\n   The definitions of how the EXP\
    \ field is used are perfectly clear in\n   RFC 3270 and RFC 5129.  However, these\
    \ RFCs do not explicitly state\n   they update RFC 3032, and this fact was not\
    \ captured in the RFC\n   repository until after work on this document was started.\n\
    \   This document updates RFC 3032, RFC 3270, and RFC 5129 to clarify the\n  \
    \ intended usage of the TC field.  The changes to these RFCs requires\n   some\
    \ changes to the actual text in those documents; Section 2\n   explains the changes.\n\
    \   This document also updates several other RFCs; see Section 2.4.  For\n   these\
    \ documents, the change is limited to changing the name of the\n   Label Stack\
    \ entry field.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [RFC2119].\n"

    \      A single LSP can be used to support one or more OAs.  Such LSPs\n     \
    \ can support up to eight BAs of a given FEC, regardless of how many\n      OAs\
    \ these BAs span.  With such LSPs, the EXP field of the MPLS\n      Shim Header\
    \ is used by the LSR to determine the PHB to be applied\n      to the packet.\
    \  This includes both the PSC and the drop\n      preference.\n      We refer\
    \ to such LSPs as \"EXP-inferred-PSC LSPs\" (E-LSP), since\n      the PSC of a\
    \ packet transported on this LSP depends on the EXP\n      field value for that\
    \ packet.\n      The mapping from the EXP field to the PHB (i.e., to PSC and drop\n\
    \      precedence) for a given such LSP, is either explicitly signaled at\n  \
    \    label set-up or relies on a pre-configured mapping.\n      Detailed operations\
    \ of E-LSPs are specified in section 3 below.\n   RFC 3270 is now updated like\
    \ this:\n   a.  A new paragraph is added at the end of Section 1 \"Introduction\"\
    :\n          The EXP field has been renamed the TC field, and thus all\n     \
    \     references in RFC 3270 to the EXP field now refer to the TC\n          field.\n\
    \   b.  A new term is added to Section 1.1 \"Terminology\":\n          TC    \
    \    Traffic Class (replaces the term EXP)\n   c.  In Section 1.1 \"Terminology\"\
    , the acronym E-LSP is now understood\n       to mean:\n          E-LSP     Explicitly\
    \ TC-encoded-PSC LSP\n   Section 1.2 on page 6 in RFC 3270 is now changed to:\n\
    \   1.2 Explicitly TC-encoded-PSC LSPs (E-LSP)\n      The EXP field has been renamed\
    \ to the TC field, and thus all\n      references in RFC 3270 to EXP field now\
    \ refer to the TC field.\n      However, we retain the acronym E-LSP (Explicitly\
    \ TC-encoded-PSC\n      LSP) as the acronym is in widespread use.\n      A single\
    \ LSP can be used to support one or more OAs.  Such LSPs\n      can support up\
    \ to eight BAs of a given FEC, regardless of how many\n      OAs these BAs span.\
    \  With such LSPs, the TC field of the MPLS Shim\n      Header is used by the\
    \ LSR to determine the PHB to be applied to\n      the packet.  This includes\
    \ both the PSC and the drop preference.\n      We refer to such LSPs as \"Explicitly\
    \ TC-encoded-PSC LSPs\"\n      (E-LSPs), since the PSC of a packet transported\
    \ on this LSP\n      depends on the TC field (previously called the EXP field)\
    \ value\n      for that packet.\n      The mapping from the TC field to the PHB\
    \ (i.e., to PSC and drop\n      precedence) for a given such LSP is either explicitly\
    \ signaled at\n      label set-up or relies on a pre-configured mapping.\n   \
    \   This is an update to RFC 3032 [RFC3032], in line with the original\n     \
    \ intent of how this field in the MPLS Shim Header should be used\n      (as a\
    \ TC field).  RFC 3270 has itself been updated by RFC 5129\n      [RFC5129].\n\
