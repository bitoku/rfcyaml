  - "Abstract\n   This document is registration for the 'example' media type and\n\
    \   'example' subtypes within the standards tree.  The 'example/*' and\n   '*/example'\
    \ media types are defined for documentation purposes only.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   From time to time, documents created by the IETF or by other\n\
    \   standards bodies show examples involving the use of media types,\n   where\
    \ the actual media type is not relevant.  It would be useful in\n   such cases\
    \ to be able to show a media type whose illustrative role in\n   the example is\
    \ clear.  In the worst case, this can be useful to debug\n   implementations where\
    \ the designer mistook the example for a\n   requirement of the protocol concerned.\n\
    \   To meet this need, this document registers the following media types:\n  \
    \ o  the 'example' media type;\n   o  the 'application/example', 'audio/example',\
    \ 'image/example',\n      'message/example', 'model/example', 'multipart/example',\n\
    \      'text/example', and 'video/example' media subtypes.\n   It is suggested\
    \ that compilers of illustrative examples involving\n   media types in trees other\
    \ than the standards tree might also\n   incorporate the string \"example\" into\
    \ their hypothetical media types.\n"

    \   against implementation in the Security Considerations and\n   Interoperability\
    \ Considerations sections and the 'multipart/example'\n   subtype were added at\
    \ John Klensin's suggestion.  Some editing\n   touchups and strengthening of the\
    \ language in the Security\n   Considerations section were done in response to\
    \ the Gen-ART reviewer,\n   Sharon Chisholm.\n"
