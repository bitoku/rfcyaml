  - "Abstract\n   Over the past few years, the number of RFCs that define and use\
    \ IPsec\n   and Internet Key Exchange (IKE) has greatly proliferated.  This is\n\
    \   complicated by the fact that these RFCs originate from numerous IETF\n   working\
    \ groups: the original IPsec WG, its various spin-offs, and\n   other WGs that\
    \ use IPsec and/or IKE to protect their protocols'\n   traffic.\n   This document\
    \ is a snapshot of IPsec- and IKE-related RFCs.  It\n   includes a brief description\
    \ of each RFC, along with background\n   information explaining the motivation\
    \ and context of IPsec's\n   outgrowths and extensions.  It obsoletes RFC 2411,\
    \ the previous \"IP\n   Security Document Roadmap.\"\n   The obsoleted IPsec roadmap\
    \ (RFC 2411) briefly described the\n   interrelationship of the various classes\
    \ of base IPsec documents.\n   The major focus of RFC 2411 was to specify the\
    \ recommended contents\n   of documents specifying additional encryption and authentication\n\
    \   algorithms.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) is a suite of protocols\
    \ that\n   provides security to Internet communications at the IP layer.  The\n\
    \   most common current use of IPsec is to provide a Virtual Private\n   Network\
    \ (VPN), either between two locations (gateway-to-gateway) or\n   between a remote\
    \ user and an enterprise network (host-to-gateway); it\n   can also provide end-to-end,\
    \ or host-to-host, security.  IPsec is\n   also used by other Internet protocols\
    \ (e.g., Mobile IP version 6\n   (MIPv6)) to protect some or all of their traffic.\
    \  IKE (Internet Key\n   Exchange) is the key negotiation and management protocol\
    \ that is most\n   commonly used to provide dynamically negotiated and updated\
    \ keying\n   material for IPsec.  IPsec and IKE can be used in conjunction with\n\
    \   both IPv4 and IPv6.\n   In addition to the base documents for IPsec and IKE,\
    \ there are\n   numerous RFCs that reference, extend, and in some cases alter\
    \ the\n   core specifications.  This document obsoletes [RFC2411].  It attempts\n\
    \   to list and briefly describe those RFCs, providing context and\n   rationale\
    \ where indicated.  The title of each RFC is followed by a\n   letter that indicates\
    \ its category in the RFC series [RFC2026], as\n   follows:\n      o S: Standards\
    \ Track (Proposed Standard, Draft Standard, or\n           Standard)\n      o\
    \ E: Experimental\n      o B: Best Current Practice\n      o I: Informational\n\
    \   For each RFC, the publication date is also given.\n   This document also categorizes\
    \ the requirements level of each\n   cryptographic algorithm for use with IKEv1,\
    \ IKEv2, IPsec-v2, and\n   IPsec-v3.  These requirements are summarized in Appendix\
    \ A.  These\n   levels are current as of February 2011; subsequent RFCs may result\
    \ in\n   altered requirement levels.\n   This document does not define requirement\
    \ levels; it simply restates\n   those found in the IKE and IPsec RFCs.  If there\
    \ is a conflict\n   between this document and any other RFC, then the other RFC\
    \ takes\n   precedence.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Interrelationship of IPsec/IKE Documents\n   The main documents describing\
    \ the set of IPsec protocols are divided\n   into seven groups.  This is illustrated\
    \ in Figure 1.  There is a main\n   Architecture document that broadly covers\
    \ the general concepts,\n   security requirements, definitions, and mechanisms\
    \ defining IPsec\n   technology.\n   There are an Encapsulating Security Payload\
    \ (ESP) Protocol document\n   and an Authentication Header (AH) Protocol document\
    \ that cover the\n   packet format and general issues regarding the respective\
    \ protocols.\n   The \"Encryption Algorithm\" document set, shown on the left,\
    \ is the\n   set of documents describing how various encryption algorithms are\n\
    \   used for ESP.  The \"Combined Algorithm\" document set, shown in the\n   middle,\
    \ is the set of documents describing how various combined mode\n   algorithms\
    \ are used to provide both encryption and integrity\n   protection for ESP.  The\
    \ \"Integ-Protection Algorithm\" document set,\n   shown on the right, is the\
    \ set of documents describing how various\n   integrity-protection algorithms\
    \ are used for both ESP and AH.\n   The \"IKE\" documents, shown at the bottom,\
    \ are the documents\n   describing the IETF Standards-Track key management schemes.\n\

    \ \"lessons learned\" from\n   implementation and operational experience with\
    \ IKEv1.  Knowledge was\n   gained about the barriers to IKE deployment, the scenarios\

    \   to IKE to facilitate its use with other protocols as well as in\n   general-purpose\
    \ use.  The documentation for IKEv2 replaces multiple,\n   at times contradictory,\
    \ documents with a single document; it also\n   clarifies and expands details\
    \ that were underspecified or ambiguous\n   in IKEv1.\n   Once an IKE negotiation\
    \ is successfully completed, the peers have\n   established two pairs of one-way\
    \ (inbound and outbound) SAs.  Since\n   IKE always negotiates pairs of SAs, the\
    \ term \"SA\" is generally used\n   to refer to a pair of SAs (e.g., an \"IKE\
    \ SA\" or an \"IPsec SA\" is in\n   reality a pair of one-way SAs).  The first\
    \ SA, the IKE SA, is used to\n   protect IKE traffic.  The second SA provides\
    \ IPsec protection to data\n   traffic between the peers and/or other devices\
    \ for which the peers\n   are authorized to negotiate.  It is called the IPsec\
    \ SA in IKEv1 and,\n   in the IKEv2 RFCs, it is referred to variously as a CHILD_SA,\
    \ a child\n   SA, and an IPsec SA.  This document uses the term \"IPsec SA\".\
    \  To\n   further complicate the terminology, since IKEv1 consists of two\n  \
    \ sequential negotiations, called phases, the IKE SA is also referred\n   to as\
    \ a Phase 1 SA and the IPsec SA is referred to as a Phase 2 SA.\n   Changes to\
    \ IKE include:\n      o Replaced multiple alternate exchange types with a single,\n\
    \        shorter exchange\n      o Streamlined negotiation format to avoid combinatorial\
    \ bloat for\n        multiple proposals\n      o Protect responder from committing\
    \ significant resources to the\n        exchange until the initiator's existence\
    \ and identity are\n        confirmed\n      o Reliable exchanges: every request\
    \ expects a response\n      o Protection of IKE messages based on ESP, rather\
    \ than a method\n        unique to IKE\n      o Add traffic selectors: distinct\
    \ from peer IDs and more flexible\n      o Support of EAP-based authentication\
    \ methods and asymmetric\n        authentication (i.e., initiator and responder\

    \   (S, November 1998)\n   [RFC2401] specifies the mechanisms, procedures, and\
    \ components\n   required to provide security services at the IP layer.  It also\n\
    \   describes their interrelationship and the general processing required\n  \
    \ to inject IPsec protections into the network architecture.\n   The components\
    \ include:\n      - SA (Security Association): a one-way (inbound or outbound)\n\
    \        agreement between two communicating peers that specifies the\n      \
    \  IPsec protections to be provided to their communications.  This\n        includes\
    \ the specific security protections, cryptographic\n        algorithms, and secret\
    \ keys to be applied, as well as the\n        specific types of traffic to be\
    \ protected.\n      - SPI (Security Parameters Index): a value that, together\
    \ with the\n        destination address and security protocol (AH or ESP), uniquely\n\
    \        identifies a single SA.\n      - SAD (Security Association Database):\
    \ each peer's SA repository.\n        The RFC describes how this database functions\
    \ (SA lookup, etc.)\n        and the types of information it must contain to facilitate\
    \ SA\n        processing; it does not dictate the format or layout of the\n  \
    \      database.  SAs can be established in either transport mode or\n       \
    \ tunnel mode (see below).\n      - SPD (Security Policy Database): an ordered\
    \ database that\n        expresses the security protections to be afforded to\
    \ different\n        types and classes of traffic.  The three general classes\
    \ of\n        traffic are traffic to be discarded, traffic that is allowed\n \
    \       without IPsec protection, and traffic that requires IPsec\n        protection.\n\

    \ to\n   negotiate authenticated keying material for use within those SAs.\n \
    \  The standard peer authentication methods used by IKEv1 (pre-shared\n   secret\

    \ the relevant protocol,\n   packet formats, special considerations, etc.  For\
    \ each RFC that\n   describes a cryptographic algorithm, this roadmap will classify\
    \ its\n   requirement level for each protocol, as either MUST, SHOULD, or MAY\n\
    \   [RFC2119]; SHOULD+, SHOULD-, or MUST- [RFC4835]; optional; undefined;\n  \
    \ or N/A (not applicable).  A designation of \"optional\" means that the\n   algorithm\
    \ meets the two basic requirements, but its use is not\n   specifically recommended\
    \ for that protocol.  \"Undefined\" means that\n   one of the basic requirements\
    \ is not met: either there is no relevant\n   IANA number for the algorithm or\
    \ there is no RFC specifying how it\n   should be used within that specific protocol.\
    \  \"N/A\" means that use\n   of the algorithm is inappropriate in the context\
    \ (e.g., NULL\n   encryption for IKE, which always requires encryption; or combined\n\
    \   mode algorithms, a new feature in IPsec-v3, for use with IPsec-v2).\n   This\
    \ document categorizes the requirement level of each algorithm for\n   IKEv1,\
    \ IKEv2, IPsec-v2, and IPsec-v3.  If an algorithm is recommended\n   for use within\

  - "8.8.1.  RFC 2709, Security Model with Tunnel-mode IPsec for NAT domains\n   \
    \     (I, October 1999)\n   NAT devices provide transparent routing to end-hosts\
    \ trying to\n   communicate from disparate address realms, by modifying IP and\n\
    \   transport headers en route.  This makes it difficult for applications\n  \
    \ to pursue end-to-end application-level security.  [RFC2709] describes\n   a\
    \ security model by which tunnel mode IPsec security can be\n   architected on\
    \ NAT devices.  It defines how NATs administer security\n   policies and SA attributes\
    \ based on private realm addressing.  It\n   also specifies how to operate IKE\
    \ in such scenarios by specifying an\n   IKE-ALG (Application Level Gateway) that\
    \ translates policies from\n   private realm addressing into public addressing.\
    \  Although the model\n   presented here uses terminology from IKEv1, it can be\
    \ deployed within\n   IKEv1, IKEv2, IPsec-v2, and IPsec-v3.  This security model\
    \ has not\n   been widely adopted\n"
