  - "STATUS OF THIS MEMO\n   This memo describes procedures for registering a domain\
    \ with the\n   Network Information Center (NIC) of Defense Data Network (DDN),\
    \ and\n   offers guidelines on the establishment and administration of a domain\n\
    \   in accordance with the requirements specified in RFC-920.  It is\n   intended\
    \ for use by domain administrators.  This memo should be used\n   in conjunction\
    \ with RFC-920, which is an official policy statement of\n   the Internet Activities\
    \ Board (IAB) and the Defense Advanced Research\n   Projects Agency (DARPA). \
    \ Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: BACKGROUND
  contents:
  - "BACKGROUND\n   Domains are adminstrative entities that provide decentralized\n\
    \   management of host naming and addressing.  The domain-naming system\n   is\
    \ distributed and hierarchical.\n   The NIC is designated by the Defense Communications\
    \ Agency (DCA) to\n   provide registry services for the domain-naming system on\
    \ the DDN and\n   DARPA portions of the Internet.\n   As registrar of top-level\
    \ and second-level domains, as well as\n   administrator of the root domain name\
    \ servers on behalf of DARPA and\n   DDN, the NIC is responsible for maintaining\
    \ the root server zone\n   files and their binary equivalents.  In addition, the\
    \ NIC is\n   responsible for administering the top-level domains of \"ARPA,\"\
    \ \"COM,\"\n   \"EDU,\" \"ORG,\" \"GOV,\" and \"MIL\" on behalf of DCA and DARPA\
    \ until it\n   becomes feasible for other appropriate organizations to assume\
    \ those\n   responsibilities.\n   It is recommended that the guidelines described\
    \ in this document be\n   used by domain administrators in the establishment and\
    \ control of\n   second-level domains.\n"
- title: THE DOMAIN ADMINISTRATOR
  contents:
  - "THE DOMAIN ADMINISTRATOR\n   The role of the domain administrator (DA) is that\
    \ of coordinator,\n   manager, and technician.  If his domain is established at\
    \ the second\n   level or lower in the tree, the DA must register by interacting\
    \ with\n   the management of the domain directly above his, making certain that\n\
    \   his domain satisfies all the requirements of the administration under\n  \
    \ which his domain would be situated.  To find out who has authority\n   over\
    \ the name space he wishes to join, the DA can ask the NIC\n   Hostmaster.  Information\
    \ on contacts for the top-level and second-\n   level domains can also be found\
    \ on line in the file NETINFO:DOMAIN-\n   CONTACTS.TXT, which is available from\
    \ the NIC via anonymous FTP.\n   The DA should be technically competent; he should\
    \ understand the\n   concepts and procedures for operating a domain server, as\
    \ described\n   in RFC-1034, and make sure that the service provided is reliable\
    \ and\n   uninterrupted.  It is his responsibility or that of his delegate to\n\
    \   ensure that the data will be current at all times.  As a manager, the\n  \
    \ DA must be able to handle complaints about service provided by his\n   domain\
    \ name server.  He must be aware of the behavior of the hosts in\n   his domain,\
    \ and take prompt action on reports of problems, such as\n   protocol violations\
    \ or other serious misbehavior.  The administrator\n   of a domain must be a responsible\
    \ person who has the authority to\n   either enforce these actions himself or\
    \ delegate them to someone\n   else.\n   Name assignments within a domain are\
    \ controlled by the DA, who should\n   verify that names are unique within his\
    \ domain and that they conform\n   to standard naming conventions.  He furnishes\
    \ access to names and\n   name-related information to users both inside and outside\
    \ his domain.\n   He should work closely with the personnel he has designated\
    \ as the\n   \"technical and zone\" contacts for his domain, for many administrative\n\
    \   decisions will be made on the basis of input from these people.\n"
- title: THE DOMAIN TECHNICAL AND ZONE CONTACT
  contents:
  - "THE DOMAIN TECHNICAL AND ZONE CONTACT\n   A zone consists of those contiguous\
    \ parts of the domain tree for\n   which a domain server has complete information\
    \ and over which it has\n   authority.  A domain server may be authoratative for\
    \ more than one\n   zone.  The domain technical/zone contact is the person who\
    \ tends to\n   the technical aspects of maintaining the domain's name server and\n\
    \   resolver software, and database files.  He keeps the name server\n   running,\
    \ and interacts with technical people in other domains and\n   zones to solve\
    \ problems that affect his zone.\n"
- title: POLICIES
  contents:
  - "POLICIES\n   Domain or host name choices and the allocation of domain name space\n\
    \   are considered to be local matters.  In the event of conflicts, it is\n  \
    \ the policy of the NIC not to get involved in local disputes or in the\n   local\
    \ decision-making process.  The NIC will not act as referee in\n   disputes over\
    \ such matters as who has the \"right\" to register a\n   particular top-level\
    \ or second-level domain for an organization.  The\n   NIC considers this a private\
    \ local matter that must be settled among\n   the parties involved prior to their\
    \ commencing the registration\n   process with the NIC.  Therefore, it is assumed\
    \ that the responsible\n   person for a domain will have resolved any local conflicts\
    \ among the\n   members of his domain before registering that domain with the\
    \ NIC.\n   The NIC will give guidance, if requested, by answering specific\n \
    \  technical questions, but will not provide arbitration in disputes at\n   the\
    \ local level.  This policy is also in keeping with the distributed\n   hierarchical\
    \ nature of the domain-naming system in that it helps to\n   distribute the tasks\
    \ of solving problems and handling questions.\n   Naming conventions for hosts\
    \ should follow the rules specified in\n   RFC-952.  From a technical standpoint,\
    \ domain names can be very long.\n   Each segment of a domain name may contain\
    \ up to 64 characters, but\n   the NIC strongly advises DAs to choose names that\
    \ are 12 characters\n   or fewer, because behind every domain system there is\
    \ a human being\n   who must keep track of the names, addresses, contacts, and\
    \ other data\n   in a database.  The longer the name, the more likely the data\n\
    \   maintainer is to make a mistake.  Users also will appreciate shorter\n   names.\
    \  Most people agree that short names are easier to remember and\n   type; most\
    \ domain names registered so far are 12 characters or fewer.\n   Domain name assignments\
    \ are made on a first-come-first-served basis.\n   The NIC has chosen not to register\
    \ individual hosts directly under\n   the top-level domains it administers.  One\
    \ advantage of the domain\n   naming system is that administration and data maintenance\
    \ can be\n   delegated down a hierarchical tree.  Registration of hosts at the\n\
    \   same level in the tree as a second-level domain would dilute the\n   usefulness\
    \ of this feature.  In addition, the administrator of a\n   domain is responsible\
    \ for the actions of hosts within his domain.  We\n   would not want to find ourselves\
    \ in the awkward position of policing\n   the actions of individual hosts.  Rather,\
    \ the subdomains registered\n   under these top-level domains retain the responsibility\
    \ for this\n   function.\n   Countries that wish to be registered as top-level\
    \ domains are\n   required to name themselves after the two-letter country code\
    \ listed\n   in the international standard ISO-3166.  In some cases, however,\
    \ the\n   two-letter ISO country code is identical to a state code used by the\n\
    \   U.S. Postal Service.  Requests made by countries to use the three-\n   letter\
    \ form of country code specified in the ISO-3166 standard will\n   be considered\
    \ in such cases so as to prevent possible conflicts and\n   confusion.\n"
- title: HOW TO REGISTER
  contents:
  - "HOW TO REGISTER\n   Obtain a domain questionnaire from the NIC hostmaster, or\
    \ FTP the\n   file NETINFO:DOMAIN-TEMPLATE.TXT from host SRI-NIC.ARPA.\n   Fill\
    \ out the questionnaire completely.  Return it via electronic mail\n   to HOSTMASTER@SRI-NIC.ARPA.\n\
    \   The APPENDIX to this memo contains the application form for\n   registering\
    \ a top-level or second-level domain with the NIC.  It\n   supersedes the version\
    \ of the questionnaire found in RFC-920.  The\n   application should be submitted\
    \ by the person administratively\n   responsible for the domain, and must be filled\
    \ out completely before\n   the NIC will authorize establishment of a top-level\
    \ or second-level\n   domain.  The DA is responsible for keeping his domain's\
    \ data current\n   with the NIC or with the registration agent with which his\
    \ domain is\n   registered.  For example, the CSNET and UUCP managements act as\n\
    \   domain filters, processing domain applications for their own\n   organizations.\
    \  They pass pertinent information along periodically to\n   the NIC for incorporation\
    \ into the domain database and root server\n   files.  The online file NETINFO:ALTERNATE-DOMAIN-PROCEDURE.TXT\n\
    \   outlines this procedure.  It is highly recommended that the DA review\n  \
    \ this information periodically and provide any corrections or\n   additions.\
    \  Corrections should be submitted via electronic mail.\n"
- title: WHICH DOMAIN NAME?
  contents:
  - "WHICH DOMAIN NAME?\n   The designers of the domain-naming system initiated several\
    \ general\n   categories of names as top-level domain names, so that each could\n\
    \   accommodate a variety of organizations.  The current top-level\n   domains\
    \ registered with the DDN Network Information Center are ARPA,\n   COM, EDU, GOV,\
    \ MIL, NET, and ORG, plus a number of top-level country\n   domains.  To join\
    \ one of these, a DA needs to be aware of the purpose\n   for which it was intended.\n\
    \      \"ARPA\" is a temporary domain.  It is by default appended to the\n   \
    \   names of hosts that have not yet joined a domain.  When the system\n     \
    \ was begun in 1984, the names of all hosts in the Official DoD\n      Internet\
    \ Host Table maintained by the NIC were changed by adding\n      of the label\
    \ \".ARPA\" in order to accelerate a transition to the\n      domain-naming system.\
    \  Another reason for the blanket name changes\n      was to force hosts to become\
    \ accustomed to using the new style\n      names and to modifiy their network\
    \ software, if necessary.  This\n      was done on a network-wide basis and was\
    \ directed by DCA in DDN\n      Management Bulletin No. 22.  Hosts that fall into\
    \ this domain will\n      eventually move to other branches of the domain tree.\n\
    \      \"COM\" is meant to incorporate subdomains of companies and\n      businesses.\n\
    \      \"EDU\" was initiated to accommodate subdomains set up by\n      universities\
    \ and other educational institutions.\n      \"GOV\" exists to act as parent domain\
    \ for subdomains set up by\n      government agencies.\n      \"MIL\" was initiated\
    \ to act as parent to subdomains that are\n      developed by military organizations.\n\
    \      \"NET\" was introduced as a parent domain for various network-type\n  \
    \    organizations.  Organizations that belong within this top-level\n      domain\
    \ are generic or network-specific, such as network service\n      centers and\
    \ consortia.  \"NET\" also encompasses network\n      management-related organizations,\
    \ such as information centers and\n      operations centers.\n      \"ORG\" exists\
    \ as a parent to subdomains that do not clearly fall\n      within the other top-level\
    \ domains.  This may include technical-\n      support groups, professional societies,\
    \ or similar organizations.\n   One of the guidelines in effect in the domain-naming\
    \ system is that a\n   host should have only one name regardless of what networks\
    \ it is\n   connected to.  This implies, that, in general, domain names should\n\
    \   not include routing information or addresses.  For example, a host\n   that\
    \ has one network connection to the Interent and another to BITNET\n   should\
    \ use the same name when talking to either network.  For a\n   description of\
    \ the syntax of domain names, please refer to Section 3\n   of RFC-1034.\n"
- title: VERIFICATION OF DATA
  contents:
  - "VERIFICATION OF DATA\n   The verification process can be accomplished in several\
    \ ways.  One of\n   these is through the NIC WHOIS server.  If he has access to\
    \ WHOIS,\n   the DA can type the commmand \"whois domain <domain name><return>\"\
    .\n   The reply from WHOIS will supply the following: the name and address\n \
    \  of the organization \"owning\" the domain; the name of the domain; its\n  \
    \ administrative, technical, and zone contacts; the host names and\n   network\
    \ addresses of sites providing name service for the domain.\n         Example:\n\
    \         @whois domain rice.edu<Return>\n            Rice University (RICE-DOM)\n\
    \            Advanced Studies and Research\n            Houston, TX 77001\n  \
    \          Domain Name: RICE.EDU\n               Administrative Contact:\n   \
    \            Kennedy, Ken  (KK28)  Kennedy@LLL-CRG.ARPA (713) 527-4834\n     \
    \          Technical Contact, Zone Contact:\n               Riffle, Vicky R. \
    \ (VRR)  rif@RICE.EDU\n               (713) 527-8101 ext 3844\n            Domain\
    \ servers:\n            RICE.EDU                     128.42.5.1\n            PENDRAGON.CS.PURDUE.EDU\
    \      128.10.2.5\n   Alternatively, the DA can send an electronic mail message\
    \ to\n   SERVICE@SRI-NIC.ARPA.  In the subject line of the message header, the\n\
    \   DA should type \"whois domain <domain name>\".  The requested\n   information\
    \ will be returned via electronic mail.  This method is\n   convenient for sites\
    \ that do not have access to the NIC WHOIS\n   service.\n   The initial application\
    \ for domain authorization should be submitted\n   via electronic mail, if possible,\
    \ to HOSTMASTER@SRI-NIC.ARPA.  The\n   questionnaire described in the appendix\
    \ may be used or a separate\n   application can be FTPed from host SRI-NIC.ARPA.\
    \  The information\n   provided by the administrator will be reviewed by hostmaster\n\
    \   personnel for completeness.  There will most likely be a few\n   exchanges\
    \ of correspondence via electronic mail, the preferred method\n   of communication,\
    \ prior to authorization of the domain.\n"
- title: HOW TO GET MORE INFORMATION
  contents:
  - "HOW TO GET MORE INFORMATION\n   An informational table of the top-level domains\
    \ and their root\n   servers is contained in the file NETINFO:DOMAINS.TXT online\
    \ at SRI-\n   NIC.ARPA. This table can be obtained by FTPing the file.\n   Alternatively,\
    \ the information can be acquired by opening a TCP or\n   UDP connection to the\
    \ NIC Host Name Server, port 101 on SRI-NIC.ARPA,\n   and invoking the command\
    \ \"ALL-DOM\".\n   The following online files, all available by FTP from SRI-NIC.ARPA,\n\

    \ and Zone Contact\n               Organization  The NetWorthy Corporation\n \
    \              Name          Ansel A. Aardvark\n               Title         Executive\

    \ name\n   that will be used in tables and lists associating the domain with the\n\
    \   domain server addresses.  [While, from a technical standpoint, domain\n  \
    \ names can be quite long (programmers beware), shorter names are\n   easier for\
    \ people to cope with.]\n         For example:  TNC\n   (5)  A description of\
    \ the servers that provide the domain service for\n   translating names to addresses\
    \ for hosts in this domain, and the date\n   they will be operational.\n     \
    \    A good way to answer this question is to say \"Our server is\n         supplied\
    \ by person or company X and does whatever their standard\n         issue server\
    \ does.\"\n            For example:  Our server is a copy of the one operated\
    \ by\n            the NIC; it will be installed and made operational on\n    \
    \        1 November 1987.\n   (6) Domains must provide at least two independent\
    \ servers for the\n   domain.  Establishing the servers in physically separate\
    \ locations\n   and on different PSNs is strongly recommended.  A description\
    \ of the\n   server machine and its backup, including\n         (a) Hardware and\
    \ software (using keywords from the Assigned\n         Numbers RFC).\n       \
    \  (b) Host domain name and network addresses (which host on which\n         network\
    \ for each connected network).\n         (c) Any domain-style nicknames (please\
    \ limit your domain-style\n         nickname request to one)\n         For example:\n\
    \            - Hardware and software\n               VAX-11/750  and  UNIX,  \
    \  or\n               IBM-PC      and  MS-DOS,  or\n               DEC-1090  \
    \  and  TOPS-20\n            - Host domain names and network addresses\n     \
    \          BAR.FOO.COM 10.9.0.193 on ARPANET\n            - Domain-style nickname\n\
    \               BR.FOO.COM (same as BAR.FOO.COM 10.9.0.13 on ARPANET)\n   (7)\
    \  Planned mapping of names of any other network hosts, other than\n   the server\
    \ machines, into the new domain's naming space.\n         For example:\n     \
    \       BAR-FOO2.ARPA (10.8.0.193) -> FOO2.BAR.COM\n            BAR-FOO3.ARPA\
    \ (10.7.0.193) -> FOO3.BAR.COM\n            BAR-FOO4.ARPA (10.6.0.193) -> FOO4.BAR.COM\n\

    \       (d) Five years.\n         For example:\n            (a) Initially  = \
    \  50\n            (b) One year   =  100\n            (c) Two years  =  200\n\
    \            (d) Five years =  500\n   (9)  The date you expect the fully qualified\
    \ domain name to become\n   the official host name in HOSTS.TXT.\n         Please\
    \ note: If changing to a fully qualified domain name (e.g.,\n         FOO.BAR.COM)\
    \ causes a change in the official host name of an\n         ARPANET or MILNET\
    \ host, DCA approval must be obtained beforehand.\n         Allow 10 working days\
    \ for your requested changes to be processed.\n         ARPANET sites should contact\
    \ ARPANETMGR@DDN1.ARPA.  MILNET sites\n         should contact HOSTMASTER@SRI-NIC.ARPA,\
    \ 800-235-3155, for\n         further instructions.\n   (10) Please describe your\
    \ organization briefly.\n         For example: The NetWorthy Corporation is a\
    \ consulting\n         organization of people working with UNIX and the C language\
    \ in an\n         electronic networking environment.  It sponsors two technical\n\
