During the first several months of 1973 we will be retrofitting each IMP and TIP with additional core memory.
At the end of the retrofit program, the memory sizes of the various machines will be as follows:
28K words TIP with magnetic Tape Option
In addition, the expansion of the TIP core memory will necessitate enlarging the TIP to two cabinets.
Listed below is the preliminary schedule for these retrofits.
We have arranged this schedule to coincide with the usual monthly Preventive Maintenance at each site so as to minimize user inconvenience, but the work required will frequently require the machines to be down longer than normal.
I will issue additional RFC's updating this schedule as necessary.
Any site which anticipate difficulty with the expansion of TIP size, and thus the floor space requirement, should contact Hawley Rising (BBN) at (617)491 1850 ext.
All dates given below are in the form (month/day) Xerox (1/3) SAAC (1/4) MIT (1/8) MITRE (1/9)
AMES TIP (1/24) Lincoln (1/24) Utah (2/1)
ISI (2/22) Case (2/26) SRI (3/7)
Rome (3/14) FNWC (3/15) UCLA (3/19)
