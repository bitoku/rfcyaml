  contents:
  - "1. IAB Membership\n   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) shall consist of\
    \ thirteen full\n   members, composed of the chair of the Internet Engineering\
    \ Task Force\n   (IETF), and of twelve sitting members.  The IETF chair, who is\
    \ also\n   the chair of the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), may\n\
    \   participate in all official IAB actions except the approval of IESG\n   members\
    \ and appeals against IESG decisions. Ex-officio and liaison\n   members of the\
    \ IAB may also attend IAB meetings but shall not\n   participate in determination\
    \ of official actions.\n   Members of the IAB shall serve as individuals, and\
    \ not as\n   representatives of any company, agency, or other organization.\n\
    \   Members of the IAB shall owe no fiduciary duty of loyalty or care to\n   IAB,\
    \ IETF, IRTF or IESG.\n"
- title: 1.1  Selection of full IAB members
  contents:
  - "1.1  Selection of full IAB members\n   Full IAB members, including the IETF chair,\
    \ are selected and\n   appointed according to the procedures defined in [BCP 10]\
    \ . Normally,\n   six sitting members are appointed each year to sit for two years,\
    \ and\n   the IETF chair is appointed every two years.\n   There is no limit to\
    \ the number of terms that a member of the IAB may\n   serve, subject to the process\
    \ defined by [BCP 10].\n   Mid-term vacancies are filled as defined in [BCP 10]\
    \ and do not\n   affect the IAB's power to take decisions.\n"
- title: 1.2 Ex-Officio and Liaison members
  contents:
  - "1.2 Ex-Officio and Liaison members\n   Ex-officio and liaison members of the\
    \ IAB have no standing to\n   participate in IAB decisions but are expected to\
    \ participate in IAB\n   discussions as appropriate to their roles.  However,\
    \ an ex-officio\n   position may be held by a full member, who does not thereby\
    \ lose his\n   or her standing to participate in IAB decisions.\n   The chair\
    \ of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) is an ex-officio\n   member of the\
    \ IAB. The IAB has an Executive Director who is an ex-\n   officio member of the\
    \ IAB.\n   The Internet Society, the RFC Editor, the IANA and the IESG each\n\
    \   appoints a liaison member to the IAB. These liaison positions may not\n  \
    \ be held by a full member of the IAB.\n   Vacancies in the liaison and ex officio\
    \ positions do not affect the\n   IAB's power to take decisions.\n"
- title: 2.  The Role of the IAB
  contents:
  - "2.  The Role of the IAB\n   The IAB is chartered both as a committee of the IETF\
    \ and as an\n   advisory body of the Internet Society.  Its responsibilities include:\n\
    \   (a) IESG Appointment\n   The IETF nominating committee established under [BCP\
    \ 10] annually\n   provides a list of candidates for vacant IESG seats and for\
    \ the IETF\n   Chair if vacant. The IAB reviews the candidates, consenting to\
    \ some,\n   all, or none.\n   (b) Architectural Oversight\n   The IAB provides\
    \ oversight of the architecture for the protocols and\n   procedures used by the\
    \ Internet. This point is expanded in Section\n   2.1 below.\n   (c) Standards\
    \ Process Oversight and Appeal\n   The IAB provides oversight of the process used\
    \ to create Internet\n   Standards [BCP 9].\n   The IAB serves as an appeal board\
    \ for complaints of improper\n   execution of the standards process, with powers\
    \ defined in [BCP 9].\n   (d) RFC Series and IANA\n   The RFC Editor executes\
    \ editorial management and publication of the\n   IETF \"Request for Comment\"\
    \ (RFC) document series, which is the\n   permanent document repository of the\
    \ IETF.  The RFC series\n   constitutes the archival publication channel for Internet\
    \ Standards\n   and for other contributions by the Internet research and engineering\n\
    \   community. RFCs are available free of charge to anyone via the\n   Internet.\
    \ The IAB must approve the appointment of an organization to\n   act as RFC Editor\
    \ and the general policy followed by the RFC Editor.\n   The Internet Assigned\
    \ Numbers Authority (IANA) administers various\n   protocol parameters used by\
    \ IETF protocols, delegating this\n   administration as appropriate. The IAB must\
    \ approve the appointment\n   of an organization to act as IANA on behalf of the\
    \ IETF. The IANA\n   takes technical direction on IETF protocols from the IESG.\n\
    \   (e) ISOC Liaison\n   The IAB acts as a source of advice and guidance to the\
    \ Board of\n   Trustees and Officers of the Internet Society concerning technical,\n\
    \   architectural, procedural, and (where appropriate) policy matters\n   pertaining\
    \ to the Internet and its enabling technologies. If\n   necessary the IAB may\
    \ convene panels of knowledgeable people, hold\n   hearings, and otherwise pursue\
    \ the investigation of specific\n   questions or topics presented to it by the\
    \ Internet Society.\n   (f) External Liaison\n   The IAB acts as representative\
    \ of the interests of the IETF and the\n   Internet Society in technical liaison\
    \ relationships with other\n   organizations concerned with standards and other\
    \ technical and\n   organizational issues relevant to the world-wide Internet.\
    \ Liaisons\n   are kept as informal as possible and must be of demonstrable value\
    \ in\n   improving the quality of IETF specifications.  Individual members of\n\
    \   the IETF are appointed as liaisons to other organizations by the IAB\n   or\
    \ IESG as appropriate.\n"
- title: 2.1 Architectural oversight in more detail
  contents:
  - "2.1 Architectural oversight in more detail\n   A major role of the IAB is long\
    \ range planning and coordination\n   between different areas of IETF activity.\
    \  The IAB, both collectively\n   and on an individual basis, is expected to pay\
    \ attention to important\n   long-term issues in the Internet, and to make sure\
    \ that these issues\n   are brought to the attention of the group(s) that are\
    \ in a position\n   to address them.  It is also expected to play a role in assuring\
    \ that\n   the people responsible for evolving the Internet and its technology\n\
    \   are aware of the essential elements of the Internet architecture.\n   IAB\
    \ members pay special attention to emerging activities in the IETF\n   and to\
    \ \"Birds of a Feather\" sessions at IETF meetings.  The IAB\n   assists the IESG\
    \ in evaluating such activities and in determining\n   whether an IETF or an IRTF\
    \ group is more appropriate.  When a new\n   IETF working group is proposed, the\
    \ IESG will forward a preliminary\n   version of the charter to the IAB for review\
    \ of architectural\n   consistency and integrity.  The IAB shall review these\
    \ proposed\n   charters and give feedback to the IESG as appropriate.\n   Pursuant\
    \ to the architectural oversight function, the IAB sponsors\n   and organizes\
    \ the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) [BCP 8].  The\n   IAB reviews proposed\
    \ IRTF groups.\n   The IAB will convene invitational workshops to perform in-depth\n\
    \   reviews of particular architectural issues.  Such reviews may include\n  \
    \ consideration of relevant IETF and IRTF activities, and of work in\n   other\
    \ organizations, and for this purpose the workshop may invite\n   presentations\
    \ by qualified parties on the design goals and decisions,\n   technology choices,\
    \ and other pertinent aspects of these activities.\n   The results of such a review\
    \ will be a report which may give advice\n   to the IETF community and the IESG.\n\
    \   The IAB may organize ad hoc bodies of independent technical experts\n   to\
    \ adjudicate technical disputes.\n"

    \  If unanimity\n   cannot be achieved, the chair may conduct informal polls to\
    \ determine\n   consensus.  The IAB may make decisions and take action if at least\n\
    \   seven full members concur and there are no more than two dissents.\n   The\

    \ publishes all its\n   findings as RFCs, Internet Drafts or messages to the IETF\
    \ mailing\n   list. However, discussion of personnel matters and possibly legal\
    \ and\n   financial matters may sometimes be required to be kept confidential,\n\
    \   and the chair may, with the consent of the full members, exclude\n   liaison\
    \ and ex officio members from such discussions.\n   Specifically, the IAB makes\
    \ use of the second level domain iab.org\n   and the URL http://www.iab.org to\
    \ publish information.\n"
