    \ The SIP REFER method defined in RFC 3515 provides a\n   mechanism that allows
    one party to induce another to initiate a SIP\n   request.  This document extends

    of a REFER may inform the\n   recipient as to the characteristics of the target
    that the induced\n   request is expected to reach.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document extends the SIP [2] REFER method defined in
    RFC 3515\n   [3] to be used with feature parameters defined in RFC 3840 [4].\n
    \  Feature tags are used by a UA to convey to another UA information\n   about
    capabilities and features.  This information can be shared by a\n   UA using a
    number of mechanisms, including REGISTER requests and\n   responses and OPTIONS
    responses.  This information can also be shared\n   in the context of a dialog
    by inclusion with a remote target URI\n   (Contact URI).\n   Feature tag information
    can be very useful to another UA.  It is\n   especially useful prior to the establishment
    of a session.  For\n   example, if a UA knows (through an OPTIONS query, for example)
    that\n   the remote UA supports both video and audio, the calling UA might\n   call,
    offering video in the SDP.  Another example is when a UA knows\n   that a remote
    UA is acting as a focus and hosting a conference.  In\n   this case, the UA might
    first subscribe to the conference URI and\n   find out details about the conference
    prior to sending an INVITE to\n   join.\n   This extension to the REFER method
    provides a mechanism by which the\n   REFER-Issuer can provide this useful information
    about the REFER-\n   Target capabilities and functionality to the REFER-Recipient
    by\n   including feature tags in the Refer-To header field in a REFER\n   request.\n"

    \  \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",\n
    \  and \"OPTIONAL\" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].\n   To
    simplify discussions of the REFER method and its extensions, three\n   new terms
    are used throughout the document:\n    o  REFER-Issuer: the UA issuing the REFER
    request\n    o  REFER-Recipient: the UA receiving the REFER request\n    o  REFER-Target:
    the UA designated in the Refer-To URI\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Feature tags can provide sensitive information
    about a user or a UA.\n   As such, RFC 3840 cautions against providing sensitive
    information to\n   another party.  Once this information is given out, any use
    may be\n   made of it, including relaying to a third party as in this\n   specification.\n
    \  A REFER-Issuer MUST NOT create or guess feature tags. Instead, a\n   feature
    tag included in a REFER SHOULD be discovered in an\n   authenticated and secure
    method (such as an OPTIONS response or from\n   a remote target URI in a dialog)
    directly from the REFER-Target.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that the REFER-Issuer includes
    in the Refer-To\n   header field all feature tags that were listed in the most
    recent\n   Contact header field of the REFER-Target.\n   A feature tag provided
    by a REFER-Issuer cannot be authenticated or\n   certified directly from the REFER
    request.  As such, the REFER-\n   Recipient MUST treat the information as a hint.
    \ If the REFER-\n   Recipient application logic or user's action depends on the
    presence\n   of the expressed feature, the feature tag can be verified.  For\n
    \  example, in order to do so, the REFER-Recipient can directly send an\n   OPTIONS
    query to the REFER-Target over a secure (e.g., mutually\n   authenticated and
    integrity-protected) connection.  This protects the\n   REFER-Recipient against
    the sending of incorrect or malicious feature\n   tags.\n"
