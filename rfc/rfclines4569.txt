Abstract This document registers with the IANA a new media feature tag associated with the 'message' media type.
This media feature tag indicates that a particular device supports 'message' as a streaming media type.
Media feature tags can be used to route calls to devices that support certain features.
The Session Description Protocol (SDP) specification [5] defines a number of media types.
[4] registers with the IANA media feature tags associated with all those media types except for the 'message' media type.
This document registers a new media feature tag that is associated with the 'message' media type.
The reason why the 'message' media feature tag was not registered by RFC 3840 was that when RFC 3840 was published, the SDP specification was RFC 2327 [1].
RFC 3840 defined media feature tags for all the media types defined by RFC 2327.
However, RFC 2327 did not define the 'message' media type.
This media type was defined by the revised SDP specification [5], which was published after RFC 3840.
Security Considerations Section 11.1 of RFC 3840
[4] discusses security considerations related to the use of media feature tags.
This specification registers a new media feature tag in the SIP [3] tree per the procedures defined in RFC 2506 [2] and RFC 3840 [4].
Identifier: 21 Summary of the media feature indicated by this tag
: This feature tag indicates that the device supports message as a streaming media type.
Values appropriate for use with this feature tag: Boolean.
The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following applications, protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms: This feature tag is most useful in a communications application for describing the capabilities of a device, such as a phone or PDA.
Routing a call to a phone that can support session based instant messaging.
Related standards or documents: RFC 4569.
Security considerations for this media feature tag are discussed in Section 11.1 of RFC 3840.
