- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document has the objective of focusing the Internet\n\
    \   communications community on requirements for telephony devices using\n   SIP.\n\
    \   We base this information from developing and using a large number of\n   SIP\
    \ telephony devices in carrier and private IP networks and on the\n   Internet.\
    \  This deployment has shown the need for generic\n   requirements for SIP telephony\
    \ devices and also the need for some\n   specifics that can be used in SIP interoperability\
    \ testing.\n   SIP telephony devices, also referred to as SIP User Agents (UAs),\
    \ can\n   be any type of IP networked computing user device enabled for SIP-\n\
    \   based IP telephony.  SIP telephony user devices can be SIP phones,\n   adaptors\
    \ for analog phones and for fax machines, conference\n   speakerphones, software\
    \ packages (soft clients) running on PCs,\n   laptops, wireless connected PDAs,\
    \ 'Wi-Fi' SIP mobile phones, as well\n   as other mobile and cordless phones that\
    \ support SIP signaling for\n   real-time communications.  SIP-PSTN gateways are\
    \ not the object of\n   this memo, since they are network elements and not end\
    \ user devices.\n   SIP telephony devices can also be instant messaging (IM) applications\n\
    \   that have a telephony option.\n   SIP devices MAY support various other media\
    \ besides voice, such as\n   text, video, games, and other Internet applications;\
    \ however, the\n   non-voice requirements are not specified in this document,\
    \ except\n   when providing enhanced telephony features.\n   SIP telephony devices\
    \ are highly complex IP endpoints that speak many\n   Internet protocols, have\
    \ audio and visual interfaces, and require\n   functionality targeted at several\
    \ constituencies: (1) end users, (2)\n   service providers and network administrators,\
    \ (3) manufacturers, and\n   (4) system integrators.\n   The objectives of the\
    \ requirements are a well-defined set of\n   interoperability and multi-vendor-supported\
    \ core features, so as to\n   enable similar ease of purchase, installation, and\
    \ operation as found\n   for standard PCs, analog feature phones, or mobile phones.\
    \  Given the\n   cost of some feature-rich display phones may approach the cost\
    \ of PCs\n   and PDAs, similar or even better ease of use as compared to personal\n\
    \   computers and networked PDAs is expected by both end users and\n   network\
    \ administrators.\n   While some of the recommendations of this document go beyond\
    \ what is\n   currently mandated for SIP implementations within the IETF, this\
    \ is\n   believed necessary to support the specified operational objectives.\n\
    \   However, it is also important to keep in mind that the SIP\n   specifications\
    \ are constantly evolving; thus, these recommendations\n   need to be considered\
    \ in the context of that change and evolution.\n   Due to the evolution of IETF\
    \ documents in the standards process, and\n   the informational nature of this\
    \ memo, the references are all\n   informative.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Conventions used in this document\n   This document is informational and\
    \ therefore the key words \"MUST\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", and \"MAY\"\
    , in this document are not to be\n   interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1],\
    \ but rather indicate the\n   nature of the suggested requirement.\n"
- title: 2.  Generic Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  Generic Requirements\n   We present here a minimal set of requirements that\
    \ MUST be met by all\n   SIP [2] telephony devices, except where SHOULD or MAY\
    \ is specified.\n"
- title: 2.1.  SIP Telephony Devices
  contents:
  - "2.1.  SIP Telephony Devices\n   This memo applies mainly to desktop phones and\
    \ other special purpose\n   SIP telephony hardware.  Some of the requirements\
    \ in this section are\n   not applicable to PC/laptop or PDA software phones (soft\
    \ phones) and\n   mobile phones.\n   Req-1: SIP telephony devices MUST be able\
    \ to acquire IP network\n          settings by automatic configuration using Dynamic\
    \ Host\n          Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [3].\n   Req-2: SIP telephony\
    \ devices MUST be able to acquire IP network\n          settings by manual entry\
    \ of settings from the device.\n   Req-3: SIP telephony devices SHOULD support\
    \ IPv6.  Some newer\n          wireless networks may mandate support for IPv6\
    \ and in such\n          networks SIP telephony devices MUST support IPv6.\n \
    \  Req-4: SIP telephony devices MUST support the Simple Network Time\n       \
    \   Protocol [4].\n   Req-5: Desktop SIP phones and other special purpose SIP\
    \ telephony\n          devices MUST be able to upgrade their firmware to support\n\
    \          additional features and the functionality.\n   Req-6: Users SHOULD\
    \ be able to upgrade the devices with no special\n          applications or equipment;\
    \ or a service provider SHOULD be\n          able to push the upgrade down to\
    \ the devices remotely.\n"
- title: 2.2.  DNS and ENUM Support
  contents:
  - "2.2.  DNS and ENUM Support\n   Req-7: SIP telephony devices MUST support RFC\
    \ 3263 [5] for locating a\n          SIP server and selecting a transport protocol.\n\
    \   Req-8: SIP telephony devices MUST incorporate DNS resolvers that are\n   \
    \       configurable with at least two entries for DNS servers for\n         \
    \ redundancy.  To provide efficient DNS resolution, SIP\n          telephony devices\
    \ SHOULD query responsive DNS servers and skip\n          DNS servers that have\
    \ been non-responsive to recent queries.\n   Req-9: To provide efficient DNS resolution\
    \ and to limit post-dial\n          delay, SIP telephony devices MUST cache DNS\
    \ responses based on\n          the DNS time-to-live.\n   Req-10: For DNS efficiency,\
    \ SIP telephony devices SHOULD use the\n           additional information section\
    \ of the DNS response instead of\n           generating additional DNS queries.\n\
    \   Req-11: SIP telephony devices MAY support ENUM [6] in case the end\n     \
    \      users prefer to have control over the ENUM lookup.  Note: The\n       \
    \    ENUM resolver can also be placed in the outgoing SIP proxy to\n         \
    \  simplify the operation of the SIP telephony device.  The\n           Extension\
    \ Mechanisms for DNS (EDNSO) in RFC 2671 SHOULD also\n           be supported.\n"
- title: 2.3.  SIP Device Resident Telephony Features
  contents:
  - "2.3.  SIP Device Resident Telephony Features\n   Req-12: SIP telephony devices\
    \ MUST support RFC 3261 [2].\n   Req-13: SIP telephony devices SHOULD support\
    \ the SIP Privacy header\n           by populating headers with values that reflect\
    \ the privacy\n           requirements and preferences as described in \"User\
    \ Agent\n           Behavior\", Section 4 of RFC 3323 [7].\n   Req-14: SIP telephony\
    \ devices MUST be able to place an existing call\n           on hold, and initiate\
    \ or receive another call, as specified\n           in RFC 3264 [8] and SHOULD\
    \ NOT omit the sendrecv attribute.\n   Req-15: SIP telephony devices MUST provide\
    \ a call waiting indicator.\n           When participating in a call, the user\
    \ MUST be alerted\n           audibly and/or visually of another incoming call.\
    \  The user\n           MUST be able to enable/disable the call waiting indicator.\n\
    \   Req-16: SIP telephony devices MUST support SIP message waiting [9]\n     \
    \      and the integration with message store platforms.\n   Req-17: SIP telephony\
    \ devices MAY support a local dial plan.  If a\n           dial plan is supported,\
    \ it MUST be able to match the user\n           input to one of multiple pattern\
    \ strings and transform the\n           input to a URI, including an arbitrary\
    \ scheme and URI\n           parameters.\n   Example: If a local dial plan is\
    \ supported, it SHOULD be configurable\n   to generate any of the following URIs\
    \ when \"5551234\" is dialed:\n   tel:+12125551234\n   sip:+12125551234@example.net;user=phone\n\

    \   sips:5551234;phone-context=+1212@example.net;user=dialstring\n   If a local\
    \ dial plan is not supported, the device SHOULD be\n   configurable to generate\
    \ any of the following URIs when \"5551234\" is\n   dialed:\n   sip:5551234@example.net\n\
    \   sips:5551234@example.net\n   sip:5551234;phone-\n   context=nyc1.example.net@example.net;user=dialstring\n\

    \n   Req-18: SIP telephony devices MUST support URIs for telephone numbers\n \
    \          as per RFC 3966 [10].  This includes the reception as well as\n   \
    \        the sending of requests.  The reception may be denied\n           according\
    \ to the configurable security policy of the device.\n           It is a reasonable\
    \ behavior to send a request to a\n           preconfigured outbound proxy.\n\
    \   Req-19: SIP telephony devices MUST support REFER and NOTIFY for call\n   \
    \        transfer [11], [12].  SIP telephony devices MUST support\n          \
    \ escaped Replaces-Header (RFC 3891) and SHOULD support other\n           escaped\
    \ headers in the Refer-To header.\n   Req-20: SIP telephony devices MUST support\
    \ the unattended call\n           transfer flows as defined in [12].\n   Req-21:\
    \ SIP telephony devices MUST support the attended call transfer\n           as\
    \ defined in [12].\n   Req-22: SIP telephony devices MAY support device-based\
    \ 3-way calling\n           by mixing the audio streams and displaying the interactive\n\
    \           text of at least 2 separate calls.\n   Req-23: SIP telephony devices\
    \ MUST be able to send dual-tone multi-\n           frequency (DTMF) named telephone\
    \ events as specified by RFC\n           2833 [13].\n   Req-24: Payload type negotiation\
    \ MUST comply with RFC 3264 [8] and\n           with the registered MIME types\
    \ for RTP payload formats in RFC\n           3555 [14].\n   Req-25: The dynamic\
    \ payload type MUST remain constant throughout the\n           session.  For example,\
    \ if an endpoint decides to renegotiate\n           codecs or put the call on\
    \ hold, the payload type for the re-\n           invite MUST be the same as the\
    \ initial payload type.  SIP\n           devices MAY support Flow Identification\
    \ as defined in RFC\n           3388 [15].\n   Req-26: When acting as a User Agent\
    \ Client (UAC), SIP telephony\n           devices SHOULD support the gateway model\
    \ of RFC 3960 [16].\n           When acting as a User Agent Server (UAS), SIP\
    \ telephony\n           devices SHOULD NOT send early media.\n   Req-27: SIP telephony\
    \ devices MUST be able to handle multiple early\n           dialogs in the context\
    \ of request forking.  When a confirmed\n           dialog has been established,\
    \ it is an acceptable behavior to\n           send a BYE request in response to\
    \ additional 2xx responses\n           that establish additional confirmed dialogs.\n\
    \   Req-28: SIP devices with a suitable display SHOULD support the call-\n   \
    \        info header and depending on the display capabilities MAY,\n        \
    \   for example, display an icon or the image of the caller.\n   Req-29: To provide\
    \ additional information about call failures, SIP\n           telephony devices\
    \ with a suitable display MUST render the\n           \"Reason Phrase\" of the\
    \ SIP message or map the \"Status Code\"\n           to custom or default messages.\
    \  This presumes the language\n           for the reason phrase is the same as\
    \ the negotiated language.\n           The devices MAY use an internal \"Status\
    \ Code\" table if there\n           was a problem with the language negotiation.\n\
    \   Req-30: SIP telephony devices MAY support music on hold, both in\n       \
    \    receive mode and locally generated.  See also \"SIP Service\n           Examples\"\
    \ for a call flow with music on hold [17].\n   Req-31: SIP telephony devices MAY\

  contents:
  - "2.7.  Multi-Line Requirements\n   A SIP telephony device can have multiple lines:\
    \ One SIP telephony\n   device can be registered simultaneously with different\
    \ SIP registrars\n   from different service providers, using different names and\n\
    \   credentials for each line.  The different sets of names and\n   credentials\
    \ are also called 'SIP accounts'.  The \"line\" terminology\n   has been borrowed\
    \ from multi-line PSTN/PBX phones, except that for\n   SIP telephony devices there\
    \ can be different SIP registrars/proxies\n   for each line, each of which may\
    \ belong to a different service\n   provider, whereas this would be an exceptional\
    \ case for the PSTN and\n   certainly not the case for PBX phones.  Multi-line\
    \ SIP telephony\n   devices resemble more closely e-mail clients that can support\
    \ several\n   e-mail accounts.\n   Note: Each SIP account can usually support\
    \ different Addresses of\n   Record (AORs) with a different list of contact addresses\
    \ (CAs), as\n   may be convenient, for example, when having different SIP accounts\n\
    \   for business and personal use.  However, some of the CAs in different\n  \
    \ SIP accounts may point to the same devices.\n   Req-45: Multi-line SIP telephony\
    \ devices MUST support a unique\n           authentication username, authentication\
    \ password, registrar,\n           and identity to be provisioned for each line.\
    \  The\n           authentication username MAY be identical with the user name\n\
    \           of the AOR and the domain name MAY be identical with the host\n  \
    \         name of the registrar.\n   Req-46: Multi-line SIP telephony devices\
    \ MUST be able to support the\n           state of the client to Do Not Disturb\
    \ on a per line basis.\n   Req-47: Multi-line SIP telephony devices MUST support\
    \ multi-line call\n           waiting indicators.  Devices MUST allow the call\
    \ waiting\n           indicator to be set on a per line basis.\n   Req-48: Multi-line\
    \ SIP telephony devices MUST be able to support a\n           few different ring\
    \ tones for different lines.  We specify\n           here \"a few\", since provisioning\

  contents:
  - "2.9.  Interactive Text Support\n   SIP telephony devices supporting instant messaging\
    \ based on SIMPLE\n   [24] support text conversation based on blocks of text.\
    \  However,\n   continuous interactive text conversation may be sometimes preferred\n\
    \   as a parallel to voice, due to its interactive and more streaming-\n   like\
    \ nature, and thus is more appropriate for real-time conversation.\n   It also\
    \ allows for text captioning of voice in noisy environments and\n   for those\
    \ who cannot hear well or cannot hear at all.\n   Finally, continuous character-by-character\
    \ text is preferred by\n   emergency and public safety programs (e.g., 112 and\
    \ 911) because of\n   its immediacy, efficiency, lack of crossed messages problem,\
    \ better\n   ability to interact with a confused person, and the additional\n\

- title: 2.14.  Voice Codecs
  contents:
  - "2.14.  Voice Codecs\n   Internet telephony devices face the problem of supporting\
    \ multiple\n   codecs due to various historic reasons, on how telecom industry\n\
    \   players have approached codec implementations and the serious\n   intellectual\
    \ property and licensing problems associated with most\n   codec types.  For example,\
    \ RFC 3551 [39] lists 17 registered MIME\n   subtypes for audio codecs.\n   Ideally,\
    \ the more codecs can be supported in a SIP telephony device,\n   the better,\
    \ since it enhances the chances of success during the codec\n   negotiation at\
    \ call setup and avoids media intermediaries used for\n   codec mediation.\n \

    \ number of codecs used in wireline Voice over IP (VoIP), and\n   also codecs\
    \ found in mobile networks for which the SIP UA is\n   targeted.  An ordered short\
    \ list of preferences may look as follows:\n   Req-71: SIP telephony devices SHOULD\
    \ support Audio/Video Transport\n           (AVT) payload type 0 (G.711 uLaw)\

    \   Req-73: Mobile SIP telephony devices MAY support codecs found in\n       \
    \    various wireless mobile networks.  This can avoid codec\n           conversion\
    \ in network-based intermediaries.\n   Req-74: SIP telephony devices MAY support\
    \ a small set of special\n           purpose codecs, such as G.723.1, where low\
    \ bandwidth usage is\n           needed (for dial-up Internet access), Speex [43],\
    \ or G.722\n           for high-quality audio conferences.\n   Req-75: SIP telephony\

  - "3.  Glossary and Usage for the Configuration Settings\n   SIP telephony devices\
    \ are quite complex, and their configuration is\n   made more difficult by the\
    \ widely diverse use of technical terms for\n   the settings.  We present here\
    \ a glossary of the most common settings\n   and some of the more widely used\
    \ values for some settings.\n   Settings are the information on a SIP UA that\
    \ it needs so as to be a\n   functional SIP endpoint.  The settings defined in\
    \ this document are\n   not intended to be a complete listing of all possible\
    \ settings.  It\n   MUST be possible to add vendor-specific settings.\n   The\
    \ list of available settings includes settings that MUST, SHOULD,\n   or MAY be\
    \ used by all devices (when present) and that make up the\n   common denominator\
    \ that is used and understood by all devices.\n   However, the list is open to\
    \ vendor-specific extensions that support\n   additional settings, which enable\
    \ a rich and valuable set of\n   features.\n   Settings MAY be read-only on the\
    \ device.  This avoids the\n   misconfiguration of important settings by inexperienced\
    \ users\n   generating service cost for operators.  The settings provisioning\n\
    \   process SHOULD indicate which settings can be changed by the end user\n  \
    \ and which settings should be protected.\n   In order to achieve wide adoption\
    \ of any settings format, it is\n   important that it should not be excessive\
    \ in size for modest devices\n   to use it.  Any format SHOULD be structured enough\
    \ to allow flexible\n   extensions to it by vendors.  Settings may belong to the\
    \ device or to\n   a SIP service provider and the Address of Record (AOR) registered\n\
    \   there.  When the device acts in the context of an AOR, it will first\n   try\
    \ to look up a setting in the AOR context.  If the setting cannot\n   be found\
    \ in that context, the device will try to find the setting in\n   the device context.\
    \  If that also fails, the device MAY use a default\n   value for the setting.\n\
    \   The examples shown here are just of informational nature.  Other\n   documents\
    \ may specify the syntax and semantics for the respective\n   settings.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Device ID
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Device ID\n   A device setting MAY include some unique identifier for the\
    \ device it\n   represents.  This MAY be an arbitrary device name chosen by the\
    \ user,\n   the MAC address, some manufacturer serial number, or some other\n\
    \   unique piece of data.  The Device ID SHOULD also indicate the ID\n   type.\n\
    \   Example: DeviceId=\"000413100A10;type=MAC\"\n"
- title: 3.2.  Signaling Port
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Signaling Port\n   The port that will be used for a specific transport\
    \ protocol for SIP\n   MAY be indicated with the SIP ports setting.  If this setting\
    \ is\n   omitted, the device MAY choose any port within a range as specified\n\
    \   in 3.3. For UDP, the port may also be used for sending requests so\n   that\
    \ NAT devices will be able to route the responses back to the UA.\n   Example:\
    \ SIPPort=\"5060;transport=UDP\"\n"
- title: 3.3.  RTP Port Range
  contents:
  - "3.3.  RTP Port Range\n   A range of port numbers MUST be used by a device for\
    \ the consecutive\n   pairs of ports that MUST be used to receive audio and control\n\
    \   information (RTP and RTCP) for each concurrent connection.  Sometimes\n  \
    \ this is required to support firewall traversal, and it helps network\n   operators\
    \ to identify voice packets.\n   Example: RTPPorts=\"50000-51000\"\n"
- title: 3.4.  Quality of Service
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Quality of Service\n   The Quality of Service (QoS) settings for outbound\
    \ packets SHOULD be\n   configurable for network packets associated with call\
    \ signaling (SIP)\n   and media transport (RTP/RTCP).  These settings help network\n\
    \   operators in identifying voice packets in their network and allow\n   them\
    \ to transport them with the required QoS.  The settings are\n   independently\
    \ configurable for the different transport layers and\n   signaling, media, or\
    \ administration.  The QoS settings SHOULD also\n   include the QoS mechanism.\n\
    \   For both categories of network traffic, the device SHOULD permit\n   configuration\
    \ of the type of service settings for both layer 3 (IP\n   DiffServ) and layer\
    \ 2 (for example, IEEE 802.1D/Q) of the network\n   protocol stack.\n   Example:\
    \ RTPQoS=\"0xA0;type=DiffSrv,5;type=802.1DQ;vlan=324\"\n"

  contents:
  - "3.5.  Default Call Handling\n   All of the call handling settings defined below\
    \ can be defined here\n   as default behaviors.\n"
- title: 3.5.1.  Outbound Proxy
  contents:
  - "3.5.1.  Outbound Proxy\n   The outbound proxy for a device MAY be set.  The setting\
    \ MAY require\n   that all signaling packets MUST be sent to the outbound proxy\
    \ or that\n   only in the case when no route has been received the outbound proxy\n\
    \   MUST be used.  This ensures that application layer gateways are in\n   the\
    \ signaling path.  The second requirement allows the optimization\n   of the routing\
    \ by the outbound proxy.\n   Example: OutboundProxy=\"sip:nat.proxy.com\"\n"
- title: 3.5.2.  Default Outbound Proxy
  contents:
  - "3.5.2.  Default Outbound Proxy\n   The default outbound proxy SHOULD be a global\
    \ setting (not related to\n   a specific line).\n   Example: DefaultProxy=\"sip:123@proxy.com\"\
    \n"
- title: 3.5.3.  SIP Session Timer
  contents:
  - "3.5.3.  SIP Session Timer\n   The re-invite timer allows User Agents to detect\
    \ broken sessions\n   caused by network failures.  A value indicating the number\
    \ of seconds\n   for the next re-invite SHOULD be used if provided.\n   Example:\
    \ SessionTimer=\"600;unit=seconds\"\n"
- title: 3.6.  Telephone Dialing Functions
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Telephone Dialing Functions\n   As most telephone users are used to dialing\
    \ digits to indicate the\n   address of the destination, there is a need for specifying\
    \ the rule\n   by which digits are transformed into a URI (usually SIP URI or\
    \ TEL\n   URI).\n"
- title: 3.6.1.  Phone Number Representations
  contents:
  - "3.6.1.  Phone Number Representations\n   SIP phones need to understand entries\
    \ in the phone book of the most\n   common separators used between dialed digits,\
    \ such as spaces, angle\n   and round brackets, dashes, and dots.\n   Example:\
    \ A phonebook entry of \"+49(30)398.33-401\" should be\n   translated into \"\
    +493039833401\".\n"
- title: 3.6.2.  Digit Maps and/or the Dial/OK Key
  contents:
  - "3.6.2.  Digit Maps and/or the Dial/OK Key\n   A SIP UA needs to translate user\
    \ input before it can generate a valid\n   request.  Digit maps are settings that\
    \ describe the parameters of\n   this process.  If present, digit maps define\
    \ patterns that when\n   matched define the following:\n   1) A rule by which\
    \ the endpoint can judge that the user has completed\n      dialing, and\n   2)\
    \ A rule to construct a URI from the dialed digits, and optionally\n   3) An outbound\
    \ proxy to be used in routing the SIP INVITE.\n   A critical timer MAY be provided\
    \ that determines how long the device\n   SHOULD wait before dialing if a dial\
    \ plan contains a T (Timer)\n   character.  It MAY also provide a timer for the\
    \ maximum elapsed time\n   that SHOULD pass before dialing if the digits entered\
    \ by the user\n   match no dial plan.  If the UA has a Dial or OK key, pressing\
    \ this\n   key will override the timer setting.\n   SIP telephony devices SHOULD\
    \ have a Dial/OK key.  After sending a\n   request, the UA SHOULD be prepared\
    \ to receive a 484 Address\n   Incomplete response.  In this case, the UA should\
    \ accept more user\n   input and try again to dial the number.\n   An example\
    \ digit map could use regular expressions like in DNS NAPTR\n   (RFC 2915) to\
    \ translate user input into a SIP URL.  Additional\n   replacement patterns like\
    \ \"d\" could insert the domain name of the\n   used AOR.  Additional parameters\
    \ could be inserted in the flags\n   portion of the substitution expression. \
    \ A list of those patterns\n   would make up the dial plan:\n   |^([0-9]*)#$|sip:\\\
    1@\\d;user=phone|outbound=proxy.com\n   |^([a-zA-Z0-9&=+\\$,;?\\-_.!~*'()%]+@.+)|sip:\\\
    1|\n   |^([a-zA-Z0-9&=+\\$,;?\\-_.!~*'()%]+)$|sip:\\1@\\d|\n   |^(.*)$|sip:\\\
    1@\\d|timeout=5\n"
- title: 3.6.3.  Default Digit Map
  contents:
  - "3.6.3.  Default Digit Map\n   The SIP telephony device SHOULD support the configuration\
    \ of a\n   default digit map.  If the SIP telephony device does not support\n\
    \   digit maps, it SHOULD at least support a default digit map rule to\n   construct\
    \ a URI from digits.  If the endpoint does support digit\n   maps, this rule applies\
    \ if none of the digit maps match.\n   For example, when a user enters \"12345\"\
    , the UA might send the\n   request to \"sip:12345@proxy.com;user=phone\" after\
    \ the user presses\n   the OK key.\n"
- title: 3.7.  SIP Timer Settings
  contents:
  - "3.7.  SIP Timer Settings\n   The parameters for SIP (like timer T1) and other\
    \ related settings MAY\n   be indicated.  An example of usage would be the reduction\
    \ of the DNS\n   SRV failover time.\n   Example: SIPTimer=\"t1=100;unit=ms\"\n\
    \   Note: The timer settings can be included in the digit map.\n"
- title: 3.8.  Audio Codecs
  contents:
  - "3.8.  Audio Codecs\n   In some cases, operators want to control which codecs\
    \ may be used in\n   their network.  The desired subset of codecs supported by\
    \ the device\n   SHOULD be configurable along with the order of preference.  Service\n\
    \   providers SHOULD have the possibility of plugging in their own codecs\n  \
    \ of choice.  The codec settings MAY include the packet length and\n   other parameters\
    \ like silence suppression or comfort noise\n   generation.\n   The set of available\
    \ codecs will be used in the codec negotiation\n   according to RFC 3264.\n  \
    \ Example: Codecs=\"speex/8000;ptime=20;cng=on,gsm;ptime=30\"\n   The settings\
    \ MUST include hints about privacy for audio using Secure\n   Realtime Transport\
    \ Protocol (SRTP) that either mandate or encourage\n   the usage of secure RTP.\n\
    \   Example: SRTP=\"mandatory\"\n"
- title: 3.9.  DTMF Method
  contents:
  - "3.9.  DTMF Method\n   Keyboard interaction can be indicated with in-band tones\
    \ or\n   preferably with out-of-band RTP packets (RFC 2833 [13]).  The method\n\
    \   for sending these events SHOULD be configurable with the order of\n   precedence.\
    \  Settings MAY include additional parameters like the\n   content-type that should\
    \ be used.\n   Example: DTMFMethod=\"INFO;type=application/dtmf, RFC2833\".\n"
- title: 3.10.  Local and Regional Parameters
  contents:
  - "3.10.  Local and Regional Parameters\n   Certain settings are dependent upon\
    \ the regional location for the\n   daylight saving time rules and for the time\

    \   Where one is specified; it SHOULD use the schema used by the Olson\n   Time\
    \ One database [52].\n   Examples of the database naming scheme are Asia/Dubai\
    \ or America/Los\n   Angeles where the first part of the name is the continent\
    \ or ocean\n   and the second part is normally the largest city in that time zone.\n\
    \   Optional parameters like the UTC offset may provide additional\n   information\

  contents:
  - "3.11.  Time Server\n   A time server SHOULD be used.  DHCP is the preferred way\
    \ to provide\n   this setting.  Optional parameters may indicate the protocol\

- title: 3.12.  Language
  contents:
  - "3.12.  Language\n   Setting the correct language is important for simple installation\n\
    \   around the globe.\n   A language setting SHOULD be specified for the whole\
    \ device.  Where\n   it is specified, it MUST use the codes defined in RFC 3066\
    \ to provide\n   some predictability.\n   Example: Language=\"de\"\n   It is recommended\
    \ to set the language as writable, so that the user\n   MAY change this.  This\
    \ setting SHOULD NOT be AOR related.\n   A SIP UA MUST be able to parse and accept\
    \ requests containing\n   international characters encoded as UTF-8 even if it\
    \ cannot display\n   those characters in the user interface.\n"
- title: 3.13.  Inbound Authentication
  contents:
  - "3.13.  Inbound Authentication\n   SIP allows a device to limit incoming signaling\
    \ to those made by a\n   predefined set of authorized users from a list and/or\
    \ with valid\n   passwords.  Note that the inbound proxy from most service providers\n\
    \   may also support the screening of incoming calls, but in some cases\n   users\
    \ may want to have control in the SIP telephony device for the\n   screening.\n\
    \   A device SHOULD support the setting as to whether authentication (on\n   the\
    \ device) is required and what type of authentication is required.\n   Example:\
    \ InboundAuthentication=\"digest;pattern=*\"\n   If inbound authentication is\
    \ enabled, then a list of allowed users\n   and credentials to call this device\
    \ MAY be used by the device.  The\n   credentials MAY contain the same data as\
    \ the credentials for an AOR\n   (i.e., URL, user, password digest, and domain).\
    \  This applies to SIP\n   control signaling as well as call initiation.\n"

    \ SHOULD SUBSCRIBE to a voice message server and what MWI\n   summaries MAY be\
    \ displayed [9].\n   Example: MWISubscribe=\"sip:mailbox01@media.proxy.com\"\n\
    \   User Agents SHOULD accept MWI information carried by SIP MESSAGE\n   without\

    \ permanent memory that\n   keeps the information even after restarting the device\
    \ or save the\n   information in an external database that permanently stores\
    \ the\n   information.\n"
- title: 3.16.  User-Related Settings and Mobility
  contents:
  - "3.16.  User-Related Settings and Mobility\n   A device MAY specify the user that\
    \ is currently registered on the\n   device.  This SHOULD be an address-of-record\
    \ URL specified in an AOR\n   definition.\n   The purpose of specifying which\
    \ user is currently assigned to this\n   device is to provide the device with\
    \ the identity of the user whose\n   settings are defined in the user section.\
    \  This is primarily\n   interesting with regards to user roaming.  Devices MAY\
    \ allow users to\n   sign on to them and then request that their particular settings\
    \ be\n   retrieved.  Likewise, a user MAY stop using a device and want to\n  \
    \ disable their AOR while not present.  For the device to understand\n   what\
    \ to do, it MUST have some way of identifying users and knowing\n   which user\
    \ is currently using it.  By separating the user and device\n   properties, it\
    \ becomes clear what the user wishes to enable or to\n   disable.  Providing an\
    \ identifier in the configuration for the user\n   gives an explicit handle for\
    \ the user.  For this to work, the device\n   MUST have some way of identifying\
    \ users and knowing which user is\n   currently assigned to it.\n   One possible\
    \ scenario for roaming is an agent who has definitions for\n   several AORs (e.g.,\
    \ one or more personal AORs and one for each\n   executive for whom the administrator\
    \ takes calls) that they are\n   registered for.  If the agent goes to the copy\
    \ room, they would sign\n   on to a device in that room and their user settings\
    \ including their\n   AOR would roam with them.\n   The alternative to this is\
    \ to require the agent to individually\n   configure each of the AORs (this would\
    \ be particularly irksome using\n   standard telephone button entry).\n   The\
    \ management of user profiles, aggregation of user or device AOR,\n   and profile\
    \ information from multiple management sources are\n   configuration server concerns\
    \ that are out of the scope of this\n   document.  However, the ability to uniquely\
    \ identify the device and\n   user within the configuration data enables easier\
    \ server-based as\n   well as local (i.e., on the device) configuration management\
    \ of the\n   configuration data.\n"

  - "4.1.  Threats and Problem Statement\n   While Section 2.11 states the minimal\
    \ security requirements and\n   NAT/firewall traversal that have to be met respectively\
    \ by SIP\n   telephony devices, developers and network managers have to be aware\n\
    \   of the larger context of security for IP telephony, especially for\n   those\
    \ scenarios where security may reside in other parts of SIP-\n   enabled networks.\n\
    \   Users of SIP telephony devices are exposed to many threats [57] that\n   include\
    \ but are not limited to fake identity of callers,\n   telemarketing, spam in\
    \ IM, hijacking of calls, eavesdropping, and\n   learning of private information\
    \ such as the personal phone directory,\n   user accounts and passwords, and the\
    \ personal calling history.\n   Various denial of service (DoS) attacks are possible,\
    \ such as hanging\n   up on other people's conversations or contributing to DoS\
    \ attacks of\n   others.\n   Service providers are also exposed to many types\
    \ of attacks that\n   include but are not limited to theft of service by users\
    \ with fake\n   identities, DoS attacks, and the liabilities due to theft of private\n\
    \   customer data and eavesdropping in which poorly secured SIP telephony\n  \
    \ devices or especially intermediaries such as stateful back-to-back\n   user\
    \ agents with media (B2BUA) may be implicated.\n   SIP security is a hard problem\
    \ for several reasons:\n      o Peers can communicate across domains without any\
    \ pre-arranged\n        trust relationship.\n      o There may be many intermediaries\
    \ in the signaling path.\n      o Multiple endpoints can be involved in such telephony\
    \ operations\n        as forwarding, forking, transfer, or conferencing.\n   \
    \   o There are seemingly conflicting service requirements when\n        supporting\
    \ anonymity, legal intercept, call trace, and privacy.\n      o Complications\
    \ arise from the need to traverse NATs and\n        firewalls.\n   There are a\
    \ large number of deployment scenarios in enterprise\n   networks, using residential\
    \ networks and employees using Virtual\n   Private Network (VPN) access to the\
    \ corporate network when working\n   from home or while traveling.  There are\
    \ different security scenarios\n   for each.  The security expectations are also\
    \ very different, say,\n   within an enterprise network or when using a laptop\
    \ in a public\n   wireless hotspot, and it is beyond the scope of this memo to\
    \ describe\n   all possible scenarios in detail.\n   The authors believe that\
    \ adequate security for SIP telephony devices\n   can be best implemented within\
    \ protected networks, be they private IP\n   networks or service provider SIP-enabled\
    \ networks where a large part\n   of the security threats listed here are dealt\
    \ with in the protected\n   network.  A more general security discussion that\
    \ includes network-\n   based security features, such as network-based assertion\
    \ of identity\n   [58] and privacy services [7], is outside the scope of this\
    \ memo, but\n   must be well understood by developers, network managers, and service\n\
    \   providers.\n   In the following, some basic security considerations as specified\
    \ in\n   RFC 3261 are discussed as they apply to SIP telephony devices.\n"

    \ TLS to the outgoing SIP proxy for\n         protection on the first hop.  SIP\
    \ telephony devices that use\n         TLS must support SIPS in the SIP headers.\n\
    \         Supporting large numbers of TLS channels to endpoints is quite\n   \
    \      a burden for service providers and may therefore constitute a\n       \
    \  premium service feature.\n   Digest Authentication\n         SIP telephony\
    \ devices MUST support digest authentication to\n         register with the outgoing\
    \ SIP registrar.  This ensures proper\n         identity credentials that can\
    \ be conveyed by the network to the\n         called party.  It is assumed that\
    \ the service provider\n         operating the outgoing SIP registrar has an adequate\
    \ trust\n         relationship with its users and knows its customers well enough\n\
    \         (identity, address, billing relationship, etc.).  The\n         exceptions\
    \ are users of prepaid service.  SIP telephony devices\n         that accept prepaid\
    \ calls MUST place \"unknown\" in the \"From\"\n         header.\n   End User\
    \ Certificates\n         SIP telephony devices MAY store personal end user certificates\n\
    \         that are part of some Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) [59]\n       \
    \  service for high-security identification to the outgoing SIP\n         registrar\
    \ as well as for end-to-end authentication.  SIP\n         telephony devices equipped\
    \ for certificate-based authentication\n         MUST also store a key ring of\
    \ certificates from public\n         certificate authorities (CAs).\n        \
    \ Note the recent work in the IETF on certificate services that\n         do not\
    \ require the telephony devices to store certificates\n         [60].\n   End-to-End\
    \ Security Using S/MIME\n         S/MIME [61] MUST be supported by SIP telephony\
    \ devices to sign\n         and encrypt portions of the SIP message that are not\
    \ strictly\n         required for routing by intermediaries.  S/MIME protects\n\
    \         private information in the SIP bodies and in some SIP headers\n    \
    \     from intermediaries.  The end user certificates required for\n         S/MIME\
    \ ensure the identity of the parties to each other.  Note:\n         S/MIME need\
    \ not be used, though, in every call.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.4.  Support for NAT and Firewall Traversal\n   The various NAT and firewall\
    \ traversal scenarios require support in\n   telephony SIP devices.  The best\
    \ current practices for NAT traversal\n   for SIP are reviewed in [51].  Most\
    \ scenarios where there are no\n   SIP-enabled network edge NAT/firewalls or gateways\
    \ in the enterprise\n   can be managed if there is a STUN client in the SIP telephony\
    \ device\n   and a STUN server on the Internet, maintained by a service provider.\n\
    \   In some exceptional cases (legacy symmetric NAT), an external media\n   relay\
    \ must also be provided that can support the Traversal Using\n   Relay NAT (TURN)\
    \ protocol exchange with SIP telephony devices.  Media\n   relays such as TURN\
    \ come at a high bandwidth cost to the service\n   provider, since the bandwidth\
    \ for many active SIP telephony devices\n   must be supported.  Media relays may\
    \ also introduce longer paths with\n   additional delays for voice.\n   Due to\
    \ these disadvantages of media relays, it is preferable to avoid\n   symmetric\
    \ and non-deterministic NATs in the network, so that only\n   STUN can be used,\
    \ where required.  Reference [63] deals in more\n   detail how NAT has to 'behave'.\n\
    \   It is not always obvious to determine the specific NAT and firewall\n   scenario\
    \ under which a SIP telephony device may operate.\n   For this reason, the support\
    \ for Interactive Connectivity\n   Establishment (ICE) has been defined to be\
    \ deployed in all devices\n   that required end-to-end connectivity for SIP signaling\
    \ and RTP media\n   streams, as well as for streaming media using Real Time Streaming\n\
    \   Protocol (RTSP).  ICE makes use of existing protocols, such as STUN\n   and\
    \ TURN.\n   Call flows using SIP security mechanisms\n         The high-level\
    \ security aspects described here are best\n         illustrated by inspecting\
    \ the detailed call flows using SIP\n         security, such as in [64].\n   Security\
    \ enhancements, certificates, and identity management\n         As of this writing,\
    \ recent work in the IETF deals with the SIP\n         Authenticated Identity\
    \ Body (AIB) format [65], new S/MIME\n         requirements, enhancements for\
    \ the authenticated identity, and\n         Certificate Management Services for\
    \ SIP.  We recommend\n         developers and network managers to follow this\
    \ work as it will\n         develop into IETF standards.\n"
