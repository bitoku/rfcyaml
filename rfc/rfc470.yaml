  - "                 Change in Socket for TIP News Facility\nThe Socket which supports\
    \ the TIP News Facility has been changed to\nsocket 367 (Octal) at BBN-TENEX.\
    \  TIP users should be uneffected by this\nchange since the TIP program has already\
    \ been changed to ICP to the new\nsocket.  Because some user TELNET programs have\
    \ been implemented a\n\"news\" command, the old socket will be maintained until\
    \ April 15, 1973\nto give implementers time to change to the new socket.\n   \
