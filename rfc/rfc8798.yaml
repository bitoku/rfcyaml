  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) [RFC8428] media type
    supports\n   the indication of a unit, using the SenML field \"u\", for the quantity\n
    \  given as a data value in a SenML record.  For this purpose, SenML\n   defines
    an IANA registry of defined unit names and their meanings; in\n   the present
    document, we call the unit names registered there\n   \"primary unit names\".\n
    \  This short document registers a number of additional units in the\n   IANA
    registry for units in SenML that appear to be necessary for\n   further adopting
    SenML in other Standards Development Organizations\n   (SDOs).\n   The document
    also defines a registry for secondary unit names that\n   cannot be in SenML's
    main registry, as they are derived by linear\n   transformation from units already
    in that registry.  Although SenML\n   version 10 [RFC8428] does not provide for
    the direct use of these\n   secondary units, future support is intended via the
    use of SenML\n   extension mechanisms, one of which is proposed in [SENML-VERSIONS].\n
    \  The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n
    \  \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in\n
    \  BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\n   capitals,
    as shown here.\n"

    - "2.1.  Rationale\n   SenML [RFC8428] takes the position that unscaled SI units
      should\n   always be used.  However, SenML makes one exception: The degree\n
      \  Celsius (as Cel) is allowed as an alternative to the K (Kelvin).\n   This
      document takes the position that the same should apply to a\n   small number
      of alternative units in wide use:\n   The Byte:  [IEC-80000-13] defines both
      the bit (item 13-9.b) and the\n      byte (item 13-9.c, also called octet) as
      alternative names for the\n      coherent unit used for dimensionless quantities,
      for the purpose\n      of giving storage capacity and related quantities.  While
      the name\n      octet is associated with the symbol o, this is in wide use only
      in\n      French-speaking countries.  Globally more widespread is the symbol\n
      \     B for byte, even though B is already taken in SI for bel.\n      [RFC8428]
      therefore registers dB as the SenML unit for logarithmic\n      relative power,
      leaving B free for the usage proposed here.  While\n      this is potentially
      confusing, the situation is widely understood\n      in engineering circles
      and is unlikely to cause actual problems.\n   The Volt-Ampere:  [IEC-80000-6]
      defines the volt ampere (VA) (item\n      6-57.a) as a unit for apparent power;
      items 6-59.a, 6-60.a, and\n      6-61.a also use the unit for complex, reactive,
      and non-active\n      power.\n   The Volt-Ampere Reactive:  [IEC-80000-6] item
      6-60.b defines the\n      volt-ampere reactive (var) as an alternative (and
      fully\n      equivalent) unit to VA specifically for reactive power (with the\n
      \     primary unit VA); it has become clear that there is strong\n      interest
      in using this unit specifically for the imaginary content\n      of complex
      power, i.e., reactive power [IEEE-1459].\n   The Joule per meter is not a traditional
      electromagnetic unit.  It\n   and its scaled derivatives (in particular Wh/km)
      are used to describe\n   the energy expended for achieving motion over a given
      distance, e.g.,\n   as an equivalent for electrical cars of the inverse of \"mileage\".\n
      \  The unit \"degree\" is in wide use in practice for plane angles (as in\n
      \  heading, bearing, etc.).  It is marked with an asterisk because the\n   preferred
      coherent SI unit is radian (\"rad\").\n"

    subregistry in the \"Sensor\n   Measurement Lists (SenML)\" registry [IANA.SENML]
    defined in\n   [RFC8428].\n   The registry has six columns:\n   *  Secondary Unit:
    a newly registered name allocated within the same\n      namespace as SenML units\n
    \  *  Description: a short description (usually just the expansion of an\n      abbreviation)\n
    \  *  SenML Unit: an existing SenML unit from the SenML Units registry\n   *  Scale,
    Offset: two rational numbers, expressed in decimal\n      (optionally, with a
    decimal exponent given) or as a fraction\n      represented using a \"/\" character
    to separate numerator and\n      denominator\n   *  Reference: where the entry
    comes from\n   Quantities expressed in the secondary unit can be converted into
    the\n   SenML unit by first multiplying their value with the scale number and\n
    \  then adding the offset, yielding the value in the given SenML unit.\n   The

    name has been taken in [RFC8428] already, where it\n      |  is a NOT RECOMMENDED
    synonym for \"/\" (unity) for legacy\n      |  reasons.  Note that the presence
    of both \"%\" and \"/100\" with\n      |  different meanings is likely to create
    confusion, so the\n      |  present document adds some weight to the recommendation
    against\n      |  using the counterintuitive unit name \"%\".\n   Example: The
    value of a quantity given as 100 ms is first multiplied\n   by 1/1000, yielding
    the number 0.1, and the offset 0 is then added,\n   yielding the number 0.1 again,
    leading to a quantity of 0.1 s.  The\n   value of a quantity given as 10 dBm is
    first multiplied by 1,\n   yielding the number 10, and the offset -30 is then
    added, yielding\n   the number -20, leading to a quantity of -20 dBW.\n   New
    entries can be added to the registration by Expert Review as\n   defined in [RFC8126].
    \ Experts should exercise their own good\n   judgment, with the same guidelines
    as used for SenML units\n   (Section 12.1 of [RFC8428]), but without applying
    rules 4, 5, and 8.\n   Note that rule 7 limits the use of what could be understood
    as\n   prefixes on their own, not the use of prefixes inside secondary unit\n
    \  names.  Guidelines to the difference between units (which can go into\n   the
    registry) and quantities (which cannot) are widely available;\n   see, for instance,
    [RS] and [BIPM].\n   As of SenML version 10 [RFC8428], SenML packs are limited
    to using\n   primary units in \"u\" fields.  The use of primary units enables
    direct\n   comparison of measurements from different sources.  Also, it\n   facilitates
    implementations that trigger on the presence of a\n   quantity in a certain unit,
    without the need to track any additional\n   secondary units that may be registered
    for this quantity.\n   Where the benefits of directly using a secondary unit in
    a SenML pack\n   outweigh the above considerations, the use of secondary units
    in \"u\"\n   fields MAY be enabled by indicating a new SenML version that\n   specifically
    allows this and/or by using a field with a label name\n   that ends with the \"_\"
    character (\"must-understand\" field) whose\n   definition specifically allows
    this.  The definition of these\n   versions and fields is outside the scope of
    the present\n   specification; one such definition is proposed in [SENML-VERSIONS].\n"
  title: 3.  New Registry for Secondary Units
- contents:
  - "4.  Operational Considerations\n   The \"Secondary Units\" subregistry is expected
    to grow at a faster\n   pace than the subregistry of primary unit names.  It also
    is amenable\n   to automatic interpretation, by making use of the scale and offset\n
    \  columns.\n   Implementers may be tempted to equip each instance of their systems\n
    \  with code to download new versions of the registry from IANA\n   frequently
    in order to be able to make use of newly defined secondary\n   unit names.  This
    can create high load at IANA and a potential single\n   point of failure.  Instead
    of pulling the registry in each individual\n   instance of the code, the software
    update mechanism (or a similar\n   mechanism that leads to less frequent IANA
    visits) SHOULD be used to\n   disseminate updated units registries obtained from
    IANA towards the\n   instances via common repositories.\n"
  title: 4.  Operational Considerations
- contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of [RFC8428] apply.\n
    \  The introduction of new measurement units poses no additional\n   security
    considerations except a potential for additional confusion\n   about the proper
    unit to use and the risk that an implementation\n   based on the assumption described
    in the penultimate paragraph of\n   Section 3 no longer works properly.  However,
    an implementation\n   processing a pack while making use of secondary units is
    guaranteed\n   to have been developed with an awareness of the risks of having\n
    \  multiple units available for the same logical type.  In any case, the\n   existing
    risk of an existing SenML implementation not understanding a\n   unit that was
    not in the initial registry content provided in\n   [RFC8428] is unchanged, and
    implementations are warned properly about\n   the potential use of secondary units
    by the need for a must-\n   understand field or an updated version field.\n"
