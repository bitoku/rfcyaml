  - "                     Information Management System\n        We intend to build\
    \ an Information Management and Statistical System\n   for the ILLIAC IV.  It\
    \ is intended to support various areas of research\n   whose problems are ILLIAC\
    \ IV suited and whose data bases are large.\n        This System will include\
    \ a user language and necessary manipulatory\n   routines for the ILLIAC IV. \
    \ It will use the datacomputer for Archival\n   storage and provide the interface\
    \ to the datacomputer for queries not\n   ILLIAC suited.\n        If you have\
    \ problems involving large amounts of data and wish to\n   learn more about our\
    \ proposed system or contribute to its development,\n   contact:\n           \
