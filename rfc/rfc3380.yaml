  - "1 Introduction\n   This document is an OPTIONAL extension to IPP/1.0 [RFC2565,\
    \ RFC2566]\n   and IPP/1.1 [RFC2911, RFC2910].  For a description of the base\
    \ IPP\n   documents see Appendix C.\n   The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is\
    \ an application level protocol\n   that can be used for distributed printing\
    \ using Internet tools and\n   technologies.  IPP version 1.1 [RFC2911, RFC2910]\
    \ focuses on end user\n   functionality with a few administrative operations included.\
    \  This\n   document defines additional OPTIONAL end user, operator, and\n   administrator\
    \ Set-Job-Attributes and Set-Printer-Attributes\n   operations used to modify\
    \ IPP Job objects and Printer objects,\n   respectively.  It also defines a third\
    \ Get-Printer-Supported-Values\n   administrator operation that returns values\
    \ that the IPP Printer will\n   accept for setting its \"xxx-supported\" attributes.\
    \  The Get-Printer-\n   Supported-Values operation MUST be supported, if the implementation\n\
    \   supports setting any \"xxx-supported\" Printer attributes using the\n   Set-Printer-Attributes\
    \ operation.\n   Nine Printer Description attributes are defined:\n   printer-settable-attributes-supported\
    \ (1setOf type2 keyword)\n   job-settable-attributes-supported (1setOf type2 keyword)\n\
    \   document-format-varying-attributes (1setOf type2 keyword)\n   printer-message-time\
    \ (integer(MIN:MAX))\n   printer-message-date-time (dateTime)\n   printer-xri-supported\
    \ (1setOf collection)\n   xri-uri-scheme-supported (1setOf uriScheme)\n   xri-authentication-supported\
    \ (1setOf type2 keyword)\n   xri-security-supported (1setOf type2 keyword)\n \
    \  Three out-of-band values are defined for use with these three\n   operations:\
    \ 'delete-attribute' for deleting Job attributes with the\n   Set-Job-Attributes\
    \ request, 'not-settable' for use in either the\n   Set-Job-Attributes or Set-Printer-Attributes\
    \ responses, and 'admin-\n   define' for use in the Get-Printer-Supported-Values\
    \ response.\n   Two operation attributes: \"printer-message-from-operator\" (text)\
    \ and\n   \"job-message-from-operator\" (text) are defined to set the\n   corresponding\
    \ IPP/1.1 Printer and Job Description attributes with the\n   same names.  These\
    \ operation attributes may be used with any\n   operation that affect the Printer\
    \ or Job object for which an\n   operation might want to indicate a message. \
    \ For the Set-Job-\n   Attributes and Set-Printer-Attributes operations, the client\
    \ MUST\n   explicitly set them, rather than using these operation attributes.\n\
    \   A Printer implementation can make the value of some attributes\n   dependent\
    \ on the document-format, e.g., \"resolution-supported\".\n"

- title: 2.1 Conformance Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.1 Conformance Terminology\n   Capitalized terms, such as MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED,\
    \ SHOULD, SHOULD\n   NOT, MAY, NEED NOT, and OPTIONAL, have special meaning relating\
    \ to\n   conformance as defined in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and [RFC2911]\n\
    \   section 12.1.  If an implementation supports the extension defined in\n  \
    \ this document, then these terms apply; otherwise, they do not.  These\n   terms\
    \ define conformance to this document only; they do not affect\n   conformance\
    \ to other documents, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n"
- title: 2.2 Other terminology
  contents:
  - "2.2 Other terminology\n   This document uses terms such as Job object (or Job),\
    \ IPP Printer\n   object (or Printer), \"operation\", \"request\", response\"\
    , \"attributes\",\n   \"keywords\", and \"support\".  These terms have special\
    \ meaning and are\n   defined in the model terminology [RFC2911], section 12.2.\
    \  The\n   following additional terms are introduced in this document:\n   READ-ONLY:\
    \ used in an attribute definition document to indicate that\n      the attribute\
    \ MUST NOT be settable using an IPP protocol Set\n      operation.  In other words,\
    \ the attribute is not settable by\n      definition.\n   not-settable: an implementation\
    \ does not support setting an attribute\n      (whether or not the attribute's\
    \ definition is READ-ONLY).\n"
- title: 3 Requirements and Use Cases
  contents:
  - "3 Requirements and Use Cases\n   The following requirements and usage are intended\
    \ to be met by the\n   specification in this document.\n   1. The end-user and\
    \ the operator need a way to modify a Job that is\n      in the 'pending' or 'pending-held'\
    \ state.\n      Usage: The end-user discovers that he/she forgot to include a\n\
    \      print instruction, such as \"finishings\" = 'staple' after\n      submitting\
    \ a job.  Rather than canceling the job and resubmitting\n      it to the same\
    \ IPP Printer, the end-user is able to modify the job\n      on the IPP Printer.\n\
    \      The operator needs to modify a job because it is requesting a\n      particular\
    \ kind of media for which there is no more, but the\n      policy is to print\
    \ the job on a comparable medium.\n   2. The system administrator needs a way\
    \ to re-configure or change the\n      policy of the IPP Printer remotely.\n \
    \     Usage: The system administrator is adding additional named media\n     \
    \ to the supported media list (setting 'name' values to the \"media-\n      supported\"\
    \ Printer attribute).\n      The system administrator is reducing the capability\
    \ of the IPP\n      Printer by removing one of the operations from the supported\n\
    \      operations list, such as Cancel-Job, because the policy is to run\n   \
    \   the IPP Printer like a public facsimile machine.  After having\n      removed\
    \ Cancel-Job from the list of supported operations, an\n      administrative client\
    \ needs to be able to display to an\n      administrator that the implementation\
    \ is capable of being\n      reconfigured to support Cancel-Job once again.\n\
    \      The system administrator is remotely configuring the IPP Printer\n    \
    \  after installing it, and so is replacing the Printer Description\n      attributes\
    \ that have the out-of-band 'no-value' value (see\n      [RFC2911], section 4.1)\
    \ with the proper values.\n      The operator is changing the media loaded in\
    \ the input tray, and\n      so is replacing the \"media-ready\" Job Template\
    \ Printer attribute\n      value with the proper values.\n"
- title: 4 Definition of the Set operations
  contents:
  - "4 Definition of the Set operations\n   The Set-Printer-Attributes operations\
    \ (as are all Printer operations)\n   are directed at Printer objects.  A client\
    \ MUST always supply the\n   \"printer-uri\" operation attribute in order to identify\
    \ the correct\n   target of the operation.  These descriptions assume all of the\
    \ common\n   semantics of the IPP/1.1 Model and Semantics document [RFC2911],\n\
    \   section 3.1.\n   The Set-Job-Attributes operations (as are all Job operations)\
    \ are\n   directed at Job objects.  A client MUST always supply some means of\n\
    \   identifying the Job object in order to identify the correct target of\n  \
    \ the operation.  That job identification MAY either be a single Job\n   URI or\
    \ a combination of a Printer URI with a Job ID, as defined in\n   [RFC2911]. \
    \ The IPP object implementation MUST support both forms of\n   identification\
    \ for every job.  If possible, a client SHOULD use the\n   Printer URI with a\
    \ Job ID rather than a Job URI, since the 32-bit\n   \"job-id\" is more readily\
    \ translated to and from other print protocols\n   that MAY be serving as gateways\
    \ into or out of the IPP\n   implementation.\n   The Set Printer operations are\
    \ summarized in Table 1:\n                     Table 1 - Operation-Id assignments\n\

    \                                     operation\n"
- title: 4.1 Set-Printer-Attributes Operation
  contents:
  - "4.1 Set-Printer-Attributes Operation\n   This OPTIONAL operation allows a client\
    \ to set the values of the\n   attributes of a Printer object.  In the request,\
    \ the client supplies\n   the set of Printer keyword attribute names and values\
    \ that are to be\n   set.  In the response, the Printer object returns success\
    \ or rejects\n   the entire request with indications of which attribute or attributes\n\
    \   could not be set.\n   The Printer object validates the client-supplied attributes\
    \ in the\n   Set-Printer-Attributes request.  For an attribute to validate, it\n\
    \   MUST meet all of the following rules:\n   1. The number of attributes supplied\
    \ by the client MUST NOT exceed\n      the maximum number that the Printer supports\
    \ in a Set-Printer-\n      Attributes request.  A Printer MUST accept at least\
    \ one attribute,\n      but SHOULD accept a reasonable number in a single Set-Printer-\n\
    \      Attributes request.\n      Note: There is no way for the client to determine\
    \ the maximum\n      number of attributes that the Printer supports in a Set-Printer-\n\
    \      Attributes request, except to try a reasonable number.\n   2. The Printer\
    \ MUST support the attribute.\n   3. The attribute MUST NOT be READ-ONLY, i.e.,\
    \ the definition of the\n      attribute MUST NOT indicate that the attribute\
    \ is READ-ONLY (see\n      Appendix A for an indication of which IPP/1.1 attributes\
    \ are\n      READ-ONLY).\n   4. The attribute MUST be settable in this implementation.\n\
    \   5. The Printer MUST support the value, according to the rules defined\n  \
    \    in Appendix A, i.e., each value of each supplied \"xxx\" attribute\n    \
    \  MUST be validated against the value of a corresponding \"xxx-\n      supported\"\
    \ Printer attribute.  One of those rules permits an\n      administrator to set\
    \ arbitrary 'name' values to those \"xxx-\n      supported\" Printer attributes\
    \ that include the 'name' attribute\n      syntax if the implementation supports\
    \ the 'admin-define' out-of-\n      band value for that \"xxx-supported\" attribute\
    \ (see section 8.3 and\n      Appendix A).\n   6. The attribute's values MUST\
    \ NOT conflict with the values of other\n      Printer attributes, including ones\
    \ being set in this same\n      operation.\n   If any of the supplied attributes\
    \ are not validate, the Printer\n   object MUST reject the entire operation; the\
    \ Printer object MUST NOT\n   partially set some of the supplied attributes. \
    \ In other words, after\n   the operation, all the supplied attributes MUST be\
    \ set or none of\n   them MUST be set, thus making the Set-Printer-Attributes\
    \ an atomic\n   operation.\n   The Printer MUST accept this operation when its\
    \ READ-ONLY \"printer-\n   state\" attribute (see [RFC2911], section 4.4.11) is\
    \ 'idle' or\n   'stopped', and SHOULD accept it when the value is 'processing'.\
    \  The\n   Printer MUST accept this operation for any of the values of the\n \
    \  Printer object's READ-ONLY \"printer-state-reasons\" and \"printer-is-\n  \
    \ accepting-jobs\" attributes, unless explicitly defined otherwise in\n   the\
    \ definition of these attributes' values.\n   This operation MUST NOT change the\
    \ value of attributes not specified\n   in the operation unless the definition\
    \ of the attribute explicitly\n   specifies such side-effects.  For example, this\
    \ document explicitly\n   specifies that when this operation sets \"printer-message-from-\n\
    \   operator\", the Printer also MUST set the READ-ONLY \"printer-message-\n \
    \  time\" and READ-ONLY \"printer-message-date-time\" attributes to the\n   time\
    \ of the operation as a side effect.  In particular, if this\n   operation changes\
    \ an \"xxx-default\" attribute, the new value MUST be\n   in the \"xxx-supported\"\
    \ attributes or the request MUST contain a new\n   value for \"xxx-supported\"\
    , which contains the new value for the\n   \"xxx-default\".  Otherwise, the Printer\
    \ MUST reject the operation.  In\n   general, Printer attribute definitions that\
    \ are settable will not\n   define side-effects on other attributes that are settable,\
    \ only side\n   effects on READ-ONLY attributes, if any.\n"
- title: 4.1.1 Settable and READ-ONLY Printer Description attributes
  contents:
  - "4.1.1 Settable and READ-ONLY Printer Description attributes\n   If the Printer\
    \ supports the Set-Printer-Attributes operation, then it\n   SHOULD support the\
    \ setting of:\n      all Job Template Default (\"xxx-default\") attributes\n \
    \     all Job Template Supported (\"xxx-supported\") attributes\n      all Job\
    \ Template Ready (\"xxx-ready\") attributes\n   that the implementation supports\
    \ (see [RFC2911] section 4.2 and\n   extensions).\n   Some Printer Description\
    \ attributes (see [RFC2911] section 4.4) MUST\n   NOT be settable, i.e., they\
    \ are defined to be READ-ONLY.  An\n   attribute marked as \"READ-ONLY\" in the\
    \ Printer Description attribute\n   table in Appendix A is such an attribute.\
    \  The Printer attributes\n   that are not marked as \"READ-ONLY\" MAY be settable\
    \ using the Set-\n   Printer-Attributes operation, depending on implementation.\n\
    \   Note: From now on, all extensions that define new object attributes\n   will\
    \ indicate whether or not the attributes are READ-ONLY, by\n   including the \"\
    READ-ONLY\" adjective in their descriptions and/or\n   explicitly stating whether\
    \ they MAY be settable.\n   The current values of each \"xxx-supported\" Printer\
    \ attribute MUST\n   reflect the current policy for support of the corresponding\
    \ \"xxx\"\n   attribute.  If an \"xxx-supported\" Printer attribute is settable\
    \ in an\n   implementation, then its value(s) MUST affect the behavior of the\n\
    \   implementation.  If an \"xxx-supported\" Printer attribute is defined\n  \
    \ to be READ-ONLY or is not-settable in an implementation, then its\n   values\
    \ MUST NOT be settable using the Set-Printer-Attributes\n   operation.  Consider\
    \ the following examples:\n      For example, if the \"operations-supported\"\
    \ Printer Description\n      attribute (see [RFC2911] section 4.4.15) is settable\
    \ in a\n      particular implementation, then changing its value with a Set-\n\
    \      Printer-Attributes operation MUST affect the operations that the\n    \

    \  with the out-of-band 'not-settable' value in the Unsupported\n      Attributes\
    \ Group.\n      As another example, consider an implementation in which the\n\
    \      \"media-default\" and \"media-supported\" are settable.  If a client\n\
    \      supplies a Set-Printer-Attributes request that contains the\n      \"media-default\"\

    \n      status code with the \"media-default\" and \"media-supported\"\n     \
    \ attributes and their values (see [RFC2911] section 3.1.7).\n      As a third\
    \ example, if a client supplies a Set-Printer-Attributes\n      request that contains\
    \ both the \"media-default\" and the \"media-\n      supported\" attributes, but\
    \ includes a value in the \"media-default\"\n      that is not a member of the\
    \ supplied \"media-supported\" attribute,\n      the Printer MUST reject the request\
    \ and return the \"client-error-\n      conflicting-attributes\" status code with\
    \ the \"media-default\" and\n      \"media-supported\" attributes and their values\
    \ (see [RFC2911]\n      section 3.1.7).\n   Access Rights: The authenticated user\
    \ (see [RFC2911] section 8.3)\n   performing this operation must be an operator\
    \ or administrator of the\n   Printer object (see [RFC2911] Sections 1 and 8.5).\
    \  Most Printer\n   attributes will require administrator access rights to set,\
    \ such as\n   \"xxx-supported\", while some will require operator access rights\
    \ only,\n   such as \"media-ready\" and \"printer-message-from-operator\".  Which\n\

  - "4.2 Set-Job-Attributes Operation\n   This OPTIONAL operation allows a client\
    \ to set the values of the\n   attributes of a Job object.  In the request, the\
    \ client supplies the\n   set of Job keyword attribute names and values that are\
    \ to be set.  In\n   the response, the IPP object returns success or rejects the\
    \ entire\n   request with indications of which attribute or attributes could not\n\
    \   be set.\n   This operation is almost identical to the Set-Printer-Attributes\n\
    \   operation and follows the same rules for validation (see section\n   4.1).\
    \  The only differences are that the Set-Job-Attributes operation\n   is directed\
    \ at a Job object rather than a Printer object, there is no\n   \"document-format\"\
    \ operation attribute used when setting a Job object,\n   the operation can add\
    \ an attribute to the (Job) object, the 'delete-\n   attributes' out-of-band value\
    \ is permitted to remove an attribute,\n   and the validation is the same as the\
    \ Job Creation operations\n   (Print-Job, Print-URI, and Create-Job), i.e., depends\
    \ on the \"xxx-\n   supported\" Printer Description attributes (see [RFC2911]\
    \ section\n   3.1).  Using the Set-Printer-Attributes operation, the administrator\n\
    \   can set arbitrary 'name' values to those \"xxx-supported\" Printer\n   attributes,\
    \ that include the 'name' attribute syntax, if the\n   implementation supports\
    \ the 'admin-define' out-of-band value for that\n   \"xxx-supported\" attribute\
    \ (see section 8.3 and Appendix A).  However,\n   the Set-Job-Attributes cannot\
    \ be used to add unsupported names to the\n   Job object.\n   If a client supplies\
    \ a job attribute in a Set-Job-Attributes request\n   that the Printer supports,\
    \ and the job was originally submitted\n   without supplying that attribute, the\
    \ Printer adds the attribute to\n   the Job object.\n   If the client supplies\
    \ a job attribute with the \"out-of-band\" value\n   'delete-attribute' (see section\
    \ 8.2), then the Printer MUST remove\n   the attribute and all of its values from\
    \ the Job object, if present.\n   The semantic effect of the client supplying\
    \ the 'delete-attribute'\n   value in a Set-Job-Attributes operation MUST be the\
    \ same as if the\n   attribute had not been supplied with the Job object in the\
    \ Job\n   Creation operation, i.e., the Printer applies its default attribute\n\
    \   or behavior with lower precedence that the PDL (see the beginning of\n   [RFC2911]\
    \ section 4.2 and [RFC2911] 3.2.1.1).  Any subsequent query\n   of the Job object\
    \ using Get-Job-Attributes or Get-Jobs, MUST NOT\n   return any attribute that\
    \ has been deleted using the 'delete-\n   attribute' out-of-band value.  However,\
    \ a client can re-establish\n   such a deleted Job attribute with any supported\
    \ value(s), using a\n   subsequent Set-Job-Attributes operation.\n   If the client\
    \ supplies an attribute in a Set-Job-Attributes request\n   with the 'delete-attribute'\
    \ value and that attribute is not present\n   on the Job object, the Printer ignores\
    \ that supplied attribute in the\n   request, does not return the attribute in\
    \ the Unsupported Attributes\n   group, and returns the 'successful-ok' status\
    \ code, if there are no\n   other problems with the request.\n   The validation\
    \ of the Set-Job-Attributes request is performed by the\n   Printer as if the\
    \ job had been submitted originally with the new\n   attribute values (and the\
    \ deleted attributes removed) and with \"ipp-\n   attribute-fidelity\" set to\
    \ 'true', i.e., all modified attributes Job\n   attributes and values MUST be\
    \ supported in combination with the Job\n   attributes not modified.  If such\
    \ a Job Creation operation would have\n   been accepted, then the Set-Job-Attributes\
    \ MUST be accepted.  If such\n   a Job Creation operation would have been rejected,\
    \ then the Set-Job-\n   Attributes MUST be rejected and the Job MUST be unchanged.\
    \  In\n   addition, if any of the supplied attributes are not supported, are\n\
    \   not settable, or the values are not supported, the Printer object\n   MUST\
    \ reject the entire operation; the Printer object MUST NOT\n   partially set some\
    \ of the supplied attributes.  In other words, after\n   the operation, all the\
    \ supplied attributes MUST be set or none of\n   them MUST be set, thus making\
    \ the Set-Job-Attributes an atomic\n   operation.\n   The IPP object MUST accept\
    \ or reject this operation when the Job's\n   READ-ONLY \"job-state\" attribute\
    \ has the values shown in Table 2.  The\n   job's current state MUST affect whether\
    \ the IPP object accepts or\n   rejects the request.  For example, in the case\
    \ where the operation\n   creates a request for unavailable resources, the Job\
    \ transitions to a\n   new state.  Table 2 shows the allowed behaviors in each\
    \ job state and\n   the transitions.\n       Table 2 - Job State Transition Table\

    \  The following are the reasons that an attribute\n      fails to validate and\
    \ the value returns for the attribute, along\n      with the indicated status\
    \ code and order of detection:\n      1. The number of attributes supplied by\

    \ a Set-Printer-\n         Attributes request: return the 'client-error-request-entity-\n\
    \         too-large' (see [RFC2911], section 13.1.4.9).\n      2. The Printer\
    \ doesn't support the attribute: return the attribute\n         with the 'unsupported'\
    \ out-of-band attribute value (see\n         [RFC2911], section 3.1.7 and [RFC2910])\

    \ section\n         13.1.4.12).\n      3. The attribute is READ-ONLY (in its definition)\
    \ or is not-\n         settable in this implementation: return the attribute with\
    \ the\n         'not-settable' out-of-band attribute value (see section 8.1)\n\
    \         and the 'client-error-attributes-not-settable' status code (see\n  \
    \       section 7.1).\n      4. The Printer doesn't support the value: if the\
    \ attribute in the\n         operation has a single value return it.  If the attribute\
    \ in\n         the operation is multi-valued, return only those values in a\n\
    \         1setOf that are not supported.  Return the 'client-error-\n        \
    \ attributes-or-values-not-supported' status code (see [RFC2911],\n         section\
    \ 13.1.4.12).\n      5. The values of some of the supplied attributes conflict\
    \ with one\n         another and/or other Job attribute values not being set:\
    \  if\n         the conflicting attribute in the operation has a single value,\n\
    \         return the attribute and the value.  If the attribute in the\n     \
    \    operation is multi-valued, return only the attribute and those\n        \
    \ values in a 1setOf that are conflicting with other attributes.\n         Return\

- title: 13 Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "13 Security Considerations\n   The IPP Model and Semantics document ([RFC2911],\
    \ section 8) discusses\n   high level security requirements (Client Authentication,\
    \ Server\n   Authentication and Operation Privacy).  Client Authentication is\
    \ the\n   mechanism by which the client proves its identity to the server in a\n\
    \   secure manner.  Server Authentication is the mechanism by which the\n   server\
    \ proves its identity to the client in a secure manner.\n   Operation Privacy\
    \ is defined as a mechanism for protecting operations\n   from eavesdropping.\n\
    \   In addition, the introduction of the Set-Printer-Attributes and Set-\n   Job-Attributes\
    \ operations creates another security threat, since the\n   client is able to\
    \ modify the Printer and Job attributes stored in the\n   Printer.  Such modifications\
    \ could lead to denial of service.\n   A malicious user could alter the policy\
    \ established by the system\n   administrator and stored in the Printer attributes.\
    \  Such alteration\n   could either grant access to more resources or deny access\
    \ to\n   resources that the system administrator has established.  For\n   example,\
    \ the malicious user could remove all of the document-format\n   values from the\
    \ \"document-format-supported\" Printer attribute so that\n   the Printer would\
    \ refuse to accept all jobs.\n   The general remedy for such malicious user actions\
    \ against Printer\n   attributes is to have strong Client Authentication coupled\
    \ with\n   Printer access control, to limit the users who have System\n   Administrator\
    \ or Operator privileges.\n   A malicious user could modify the Job Template attributes\
    \ of another\n   user's Job, such as the \"copies\" attribute.  For example, setting\
    \ the\n   number of copies to a large number.\n   The general remedy for such\
    \ malicious user actions against another\n   user's job is to have strong Client\
    \ Authentication coupled with\n   Printer access control to limit the users who\
    \ have System\n   Administrator or Operator privileges who can modify any job\
    \ and, in\n   addition, store the Client Authentication with each Job so that\
    \ only\n   the job owner End User can modify his/her own job.\n"

  - "Appendix C: Description of the Base IPP Documents (Informative)\n   The base\
    \ set of IPP documents includes:\n      Design Goals for an Internet Printing\
    \ Protocol [RFC2567]\n      Rationale for the Structure and Model and Protocol\
    \ for the\n      Internet Printing Protocol [RFC2568]\n      Internet Printing\
    \ Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics [RFC2911]\n      Internet Printing Protocol/1.1:\
    \ Encoding and Transport [RFC2910]\n      Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Implementer's\
    \ Guide [RFC3196]\n      Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols [RFC2569]\n   The\
    \ \"Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol\" document takes a\n   broad\
    \ look at distributed printing functionality, and it enumerates\n   real-life\
    \ scenarios that help to clarify the features that need to be\n   included in\
    \ a printing protocol for the Internet.  It identifies\n   requirements for three\
    \ types of users: end users, operators, and\n   administrators.  It calls out\
    \ a subset of end user requirements that\n   are satisfied in IPP/1.0 [RFC2566,\
    \ RFC2565].  A few OPTIONAL operator\n   operations have been added to IPP/1.1\
    \ [RFC2911, RFC2910].\n   The \"Rationale for the Structure and Model and Protocol\
    \ for the\n   Internet Printing Protocol\" document describes IPP from a high\
    \ level\n   view, defines a roadmap for the various documents that form the suite\n\
    \   of IPP specification documents, and gives background and rationale\n   for\
    \ the IETF IPP working group's major decisions.\n   The \"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1:\
    \ Model and Semantics\" document\n   describes a simplified model with abstract\
    \ objects, their attributes,\n   and their operations.  The model introduces a\
    \ Printer and a Job.  The\n   Job supports multiple documents per Job.  The model\
    \ document also\n   addresses how security, internationalization, and directory\
    \ issues\n   are addressed.\n   The \"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding\
    \ and Transport\" document\n   is a formal mapping of the abstract operations\
    \ and attributes defined\n   in the model document onto HTTP/1.1 [RFC2616].  It\
    \ also defines the\n   encoding rules for a new Internet MIME media type called\n\
    \   \"application/ipp\".  This document also defines the rules for\n   transporting\
    \ over HTTP, a message body whose Content-Type is\n   \"application/ipp\".  This\
    \ document defines the 'ipp' scheme for\n   identifying IPP printers and jobs.\n\
    \   The \"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Implementer's Guide\" document\n   gives\
    \ insight and advice to implementers of IPP clients and IPP\n   objects.  It is\
    \ intended to help them understand IPP/1.1 and some of\n   the considerations\
    \ that may assist them in the design of their client\n   and/or IPP object implementations.\
    \  For example, a typical order of\n   processing requests is given, including\
    \ error checking.  Motivation\n   for some of the specification decisions are\
    \ also included.\n   The \"Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols\" document gives\
    \ some\n   advice to implementers of gateways between IPP and LPD (Line Printer\n\
    \   Daemon) implementations.\n"
