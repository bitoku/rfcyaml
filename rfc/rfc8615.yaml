  - "1.  Introduction\n   Some applications on the Web require the discovery of information\n
    \  about an origin [RFC6454] (sometimes called \"site-wide metadata\")\n   before
    making a request.  For example, the Robots Exclusion Protocol\n   (http://www.robotstxt.org)
    specifies a way for automated processes to\n   obtain permission to access resources;
    likewise, the Platform for\n   Privacy Preferences [P3P] tells user agents how
    to discover privacy\n   policy before interacting with an origin server.\n   While
    there are several ways to access per-resource metadata (e.g.,\n   HTTP header
    fields, PROPFIND in Web Distributed Authoring and\n   Versioning (WebDAV) [RFC4918]),
    the perceived overhead (either in\n   terms of client-perceived latency and/or
    deployment difficulties)\n   associated with them often precludes their use in
    these scenarios.\n   At the same time, it has become more popular to use HTTP
    as a\n   substrate for non-Web protocols.  Sometimes, such protocols need a\n
    \  way to locate one or more resources on a given host.\n   When this happens,
    one solution is to designate a \"well-known\n   location\" for data or services
    related to the origin overall, so that\n   it can be easily located.  However,
    this approach has the drawback of\n   risking collisions, both with other such
    designated \"well-known\n   locations\" and with resources that the origin has
    created (or wishes\n   to create).  Furthermore, defining well-known locations
    usurps the\n   origin's control over its own URI space [RFC7320].\n   To address
    these uses, this memo reserves a path prefix in HTTP,\n   HTTPS, WebSocket (WS),
    and Secure WebSocket (WSS) URIs for these\n   \"well-known locations\", \"/.well-known/\".
    \ Future specifications that\n   need to define a resource for such metadata can
    register their use to\n   avoid collisions and minimise impingement upon origins'
    URI space.\n   Well-known URIs can also be used with other URI schemes, but only\n
    \  when those schemes' definitions explicitly allow it.\n"

    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT

    in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"
  title: 2.  Notational Conventions
- contents:
  - "3.  Well-Known URIs\n   A well-known URI is a URI [RFC3986] whose path component
    begins with\n   the characters \"/.well-known/\", provided that the scheme is\n
    \  explicitly defined to support well-known URIs.\n   For example, if an application
    registers the name 'example', the\n   corresponding well-known URI on 'http://www.example.com/'
    would be\n   'http://www.example.com/.well-known/example'.\n   This specification
    updates the \"http\" [RFC7230] and \"https\" [RFC7230]\n   schemes to support
    well-known URIs.  Other existing schemes can use\n   the appropriate process for
    updating their definitions; for example,\n   [RFC8307] does so for the \"ws\"
    and \"wss\" schemes.  The \"Uniform\n   Resource Identifier (URI) Schemes\" registry
    tracks which schemes\n   support well-known URIs; see Section 5.2.\n   Applications
    that wish to mint new well-known URIs MUST register\n   them, following the procedures
    in Section 5.1, subject to the\n   following requirements.\n   Registered names
    MUST conform to the \"segment-nz\" production in\n   [RFC3986].  This means they
    cannot contain the \"/\" character.\n   Registered names for a specific application
    SHOULD be correspondingly\n   precise; \"squatting\" on generic terms is not encouraged.
    \ For\n   example, if the Example application wants a well-known location for\n
    \  metadata, an appropriate registered name might be \"example-metadata\"\n   or
    even \"example.com-metadata\", not \"metadata\".\n   At a minimum, a registration
    will reference a specification that\n   defines the format and associated media
    type(s) to be obtained by\n   dereferencing the well-known URI, along with the
    URI scheme(s) that\n   the well-known URI can be used with.  If no URI schemes
    are\n   explicitly specified, \"http\" and \"https\" are assumed.\n   Typically,
    applications will use the default port for the given\n   scheme; if an alternative
    port is used, it MUST be explicitly\n   specified by the application in question.\n
    \  Registrations MAY also contain additional information, such as the\n   syntax
    of additional path components, query strings, and/or fragment\n   identifiers
    to be appended to the well-known URI, or protocol-\n   specific details (e.g.,
    HTTP [RFC7231] method handling).\n   Note that this specification defines neither
    how to determine the\n   hostname to use to find the well-known URI for a particular\n
    \  application, nor the scope of the metadata discovered by\n   dereferencing
    the well-known URI; both should be defined by the\n   application itself.\n   Also,
    this specification does not define a format or media type for\n   the resource
    located at \"/.well-known/\", and clients should not\n   expect a resource to
    exist at that location.\n   Well-known URIs are rooted in the top of the path's
    hierarchy; they\n   are not well-known by definition in other parts of the path.
    \ For\n   example, \"/.well-known/example\" is a well-known URI, whereas\n   \"/foo/.well-known/example\"
    is not.\n   See also Section 4 for Security Considerations regarding well-known\n
    \  locations.\n"

      at\n   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/>.  Registration\n
      \  requests can be made by following the instructions located there or\n   by
      sending an email to the <wellknown-uri-review@ietf.org> mailing\n   list.\n
      \  Registration requests consist of at least the following information:\n   URI
      suffix:  The name requested for the well-known URI, relative to\n      \"/.well-known/\";
      e.g., \"example\".\n   Change controller:  For Standards Track RFCs, state \"IETF\".
      \ For\n      others, give the name of the responsible party.  Other details\n
      \     (e.g., email address, home page URI) may also be included.\n   Specification
      document(s):  Reference to the document that specifies\n      the field, preferably
      including a URI that can be used to retrieve\n      a copy of the document.
      \ An indication of the relevant sections\n      may also be included, but is
      not required.\n   Status:  One of \"permanent\" or \"provisional\".  See guidance
      below.\n   Related information:  Optionally, citations to additional documents\n
      \     containing further relevant information.\n   General requirements for
      registered values are described in\n   Section 3.\n   Values defined by Standards
      Track RFCs and other open standards (in\n   the sense of [RFC2026], Section
      7.1.1) have a status of \"permanent\".\n   Other values can also be registered
      as permanent, if the experts find\n   that they are in use, in consultation
      with the community.  Other\n   values should be registered as \"provisional\".\n
      \  Provisional entries can be removed by the experts if -- in\n   consultation
      with the community -- the experts find that they are not\n   in use.  The experts
      can change a provisional entry's status to\n   permanent; in doing so, the experts
      should consider how widely used a\n   value is and consult the community beforehand.\n
      \  Note that \"consult the community\" above refers to those responsible\n   for
      the URI scheme(s) in question.  Generally, this would take place\n   on the
      mailing list(s) of the appropriate Working Group(s) (possibly\n   concluded),
      or on <art@ietf.org> if no such list exists.\n   Well-known URIs can be registered
      by third parties (including the\n   expert(s)), if the expert(s) determine that
      an unregistered well-\n   known URI is widely deployed and not likely to be
      registered in a\n   timely manner otherwise.  Such registrations still are subject
      to the\n   requirements defined, including the need to reference a\n   specification.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Applications minting new well-known URIs, as
    well as administrators\n   deploying them, will need to consider several security-related\n
    \  issues, including (but not limited to) exposure of sensitive data,\n   denial-of-service
    attacks (in addition to normal load issues), server\n   and client authentication,
    vulnerability to DNS rebinding attacks,\n   and attacks where limited access to
    a server grants the ability to\n   affect how well-known URIs are served.\n   [RFC3552]

  - contents:
    - "4.1.  Protecting Well-Known Resources\n   Because well-known locations effectively
      represent the entire origin,\n   server operators should appropriately control
      the ability to write to\n   them.  This is especially true when more than one
      entity is\n   co-located on the same origin.  Even for origins that are controlled\n
      \  by and represent a single entity, due care should be taken to assure\n   that
      write access to well-known locations is not granted unwittingly,\n   either
      externally through server configuration or locally through\n   implementation
      permissions (e.g., on a filesystem).\n"

    - "4.2.  Interaction with Web Browsing\n   Applications using well-known URIs
      for \"http\" or \"https\" URLs need to\n   be aware that well-known resources
      will be accessible to Web\n   browsers, and therefore are able to be manipulated
      by content\n   obtained from other parts of that origin.  If an attacker is
      able to\n   inject content (e.g., through a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability),\n
      \  they will be able to make potentially arbitrary requests to the well-\n   known
      resource.\n   HTTP and HTTPS also use origins as a security boundary for many
      other\n   mechanisms, including (but not limited to) cookies [RFC6265], Web\n
      \  Storage [WEBSTORAGE], and various capabilities.\n   An application that defines
      well-known locations should not assume\n   that it has sole access to these
      mechanisms or that it is the only\n   application using the origin.  Depending
      on the nature of the\n   application, mitigations can include:\n   o  Encrypting
      sensitive information\n   o  Allowing flexibility in the use of identifiers
      (e.g., cookie\n      names) to avoid collisions with other applications\n   o
      \ Using the 'HttpOnly' flag on cookies to assure that cookies are\n      not
      exposed to browser scripting languages [RFC6265]\n   o  Using the 'Path' parameter
      on cookies to assure that they are not\n      available to other parts of the
      origin [RFC6265]\n   o  Using X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff [FETCH] to assure
      that\n      content under attacker control can't be coaxed into a form that
      is\n      interpreted as active content by a Web browser\n   Other good practices
      include:\n   o  Using an application-specific media type in the Content-Type\n
      \     header field, and requiring clients to fail if it is not used\n   o  Using
      Content-Security-Policy [CSP] to constrain the capabilities\n      of active
      content (such as HTML [HTML5]), thereby mitigating\n      Cross-Site Scripting
      attacks\n   o  Using Referrer-Policy [REFERRER-POLICY] to prevent sensitive
      data\n      in URLs from being leaked in the Referer request header field\n
      \  o  Avoiding use of compression on any sensitive information (e.g.,\n      authentication
      tokens, passwords), as the scripting environment\n      offered by Web browsers
      allows an attacker to repeatedly probe the\n      compression space; if the
      attacker has access to the path of the\n      communication, they can use this
      capability to recover that\n      information.\n"

    - "4.3.  Scoping Applications\n   This memo does not specify the scope of applicability
      for the\n   information obtained from a well-known URI, and does not specify
      how\n   to discover a well-known URI for a particular application.\n   Individual
      applications using this mechanism must define both\n   aspects; if this is not
      specified, security issues can arise from\n   implementation deviations and
      confusion about boundaries between\n   applications.\n   Applying metadata discovered
      in a well-known URI to resources other\n   than those co-located on the same
      origin risks administrative as well\n   as security issues.  For example, allowing\n
      \  \"https://example.com/.well-known/example\" to apply policy to\n   \"https://department.example.com\",
      \"https://www.example.com\", or even\n   \"https://www.example.com:8000\" assumes
      a relationship between hosts\n   where there might be none, thereby giving control
      to a potential\n   attacker.\n   Likewise, specifying that a well-known URI
      on a particular hostname\n   is to be used to bootstrap a protocol can cause
      a large number of\n   undesired requests.  For example, if a well-known HTTPS
      URI is used\n   to find policy about a separate service such as email, it can
      result\n   in a flood of requests to Web servers, even if they don't implement\n
      \  the well-known URI.  Such undesired requests can resemble a denial-\n   of-service
      attack.\n"

  - "Appendix A.  Frequently Asked Questions\n   Aren't well-known locations bad for
    the Web?\n      They are, but for various reasons -- both technical and social
    --\n      they are sometimes necessary.  This memo defines a \"sandbox\" for\n
    \     them, to reduce the risks of collision and to minimise the impact\n      upon
    preexisting URIs on sites.\n   Why \"/.well-known?\"\n      It's short, descriptive,
    and according to search indices, not\n      widely used.\n   What impact does
    this have on existing mechanisms, such as P3P and\n   robots.txt?\n      None,
    until they choose to use this mechanism.\n   Why aren't per-directory well-known
    locations defined?\n      Allowing every URI path segment to have a well-known
    location\n      (e.g., \"/images/.well-known/\") would increase the risks of\n
    \     colliding with a preexisting URI on a site, and generally these\n      solutions
    are found not to scale well because they're too\n      \"chatty\".\n"
