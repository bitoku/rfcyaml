- title: 2.  Origin Validation State Extended Community
  contents:
  - "2.  Origin Validation State Extended Community\n   The origin validation state\
    \ extended community is an opaque extended\n   community [RFC4360] with the following\
    \ encoding:\n        0                   1                   2               \

    \ 1\n       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \       |       0x43    |      0x00     |             Reserved          |\n  \
    \     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n    \
    \   |                    Reserved                   |validationstate|\n      \
    \ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n   The value\
    \ of the high-order octet of the extended Type field is 0x43,\n   which indicates\
    \ it is non-transitive.  The value of the low-order\n   octet of the extended\
    \ Type field as assigned by IANA is 0x00.  The\n   Reserved field MUST be set\
    \ to 0 and ignored upon the receipt of this\n   community.  The last octet of\
    \ the extended community is an unsigned\n   integer that gives the route's validation\
    \ state [RFC6811].  It can\n   assume the following values:\n                \
    \     +-------+-----------------------------+\n                     | Value |\
    \ Meaning                     |\n                     +-------+-----------------------------+\n\
    \                     |   0   | Lookup result = \"valid\"     |\n            \
    \         |   1   | Lookup result = \"not found\" |\n                     |  \
    \ 2   | Lookup result = \"invalid\"   |\n                     +-------+-----------------------------+\n\
    \   If the router is configured to support the extensions defined in this\n  \
    \ document, it SHOULD attach the origin validation state extended\n   community\
    \ to BGP UPDATE messages sent to IBGP peers by mapping the\n   computed validation\
    \ state in the last octet of the extended\n   community.  Similarly, a receiving\
    \ BGP speaker, in the absence of\n   validation state set based on local data,\
    \ SHOULD derive a validation\n   state from the last octet of the extended community,\
    \ if present.\n   An implementation SHOULD NOT send more than one instance of\
    \ the\n   origin validation state extended community.  However, if more than\n\
    \   one instance is received, an implementation MUST disregard all\n   instances\
    \ other than the one with the numerically greatest validation\n   state value.\
    \  If the value received is greater than the largest\n   specified value (2),\
    \ the implementation MUST apply a strategy similar\n   to attribute discard [RFC7606]\
    \ by discarding the erroneous community\n   and logging the error for further\
    \ analysis.\n   By default, implementations MUST drop the origin validation state\n\
    \   extended community if received from an External BGP (EBGP) peer,\n   without\
    \ processing it further.  Similarly, by default, an\n   implementation SHOULD\
    \ NOT send the community to EBGP peers.  However,\n   it SHOULD be possible to\
    \ configure an implementation to send or\n   accept the community when warranted.\
    \  An example of a case where the\n   community would reasonably be received from,\
    \ or sent to, an EBGP peer\n   is when two adjacent ASes are under control of\
    \ the same\n   administration.  A second example is documented in [SIDR-RPKI].\n"
- title: 3.  Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Deployment Considerations\n   In deployment scenarios in which not all the\
    \ speakers in an\n   autonomous system are upgraded to support the extensions\
    \ defined in\n   this document, it is necessary to define policies that match\
    \ on the\n   origin validation extended community and set another BGP attribute\n\
    \   [RFC6811] that influences selection of the best path in the same way\n   that\
    \ an implementation of this extension would.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has registered the value 0x00, with the name\
    \ \"BGP Origin\n   Validation State Extended Community\", in the \"Non-Transitive\
    \ Opaque\n   Extended Community Sub-Types\" registry.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Security considerations such as those described\
    \ in [RFC4272] continue\n   to apply.  Because this document introduces an extended\
    \ community\n   that will generally be used to affect route selection, the analysis\n\
    \   in Section 4.5 (\"Falsification\") of [RFC4593] is relevant.  These\n   issues\
    \ are neither new nor unique to the origin validation extended\n   community.\n\
    \   The security considerations provided in [RFC6811] apply equally to\n   this\
    \ application of origin validation.  In addition, this document\n   describes\
    \ a scheme where router A outsources validation to some\n   router B.  If this\
    \ scheme is used, the participating routers should\n   have the appropriate trust\
    \ relationship -- B should trust A either\n   because they are under the same\
    \ administrative control or for some\n   other reason (for example, consider [SIDR-RPKI]).\
    \  The security\n   properties of the TCP connection between the two routers should\
    \ also\n   be considered.  See Section 5.1 of [RFC7454] for advice regarding\n\
    \   protection of the TCP connection.\n"
