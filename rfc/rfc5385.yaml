- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Internet Drafts and RFCs are predominantly written in embedded-text,\n\
    \   compile-based formatting systems [1][4][5].  The primary and first\n   such\
    \ system is NROFF, a text-formatting utility based on manual entry\n   of embedded\
    \ configuration commands, such as \".p\" for new paragraphs.\n   XML is a more\
    \ recent alternative that uses structure tags instead of\n   explicit formatting\
    \ commands to allow a single file (.xml) to be\n   'compiled' into ASCII output,\
    \ HTML, or a variety of other formats as\n   desired [7].\n   Although XML adds\
    \ more modern semantic information to the structure\n   tags, neither system supports\
    \ modern WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-\n   you-get) editing.  Editors such as\
    \ Microsoft Word and Corel\n   WordPerfect provide not only WYSIWYG editing, but\
    \ also semantic tags\n   as well as outline-mode capabilities.  To that end, a\
    \ Word template\n   called 2-Word.template.rtf was created that supports authoring\
    \ RFCs,\n   as described in RFC 3285 [6].  That version succeeded in enabling\n\
    \   Word-based RFC editing, but did not support Word's outline mode\n   renumbering\
    \ capabilities.\n   This document describes the properties and use of a revised\
    \ Microsoft\n   Word template (.dot) file that supports Internet Draft and RFC\n\
    \   formatting, intended as an update to that of RFC 3285.  This version,\n  \
    \ called 2-Word-v2.0.template.dot, addresses a number of issues with\n   the preliminary\
    \ version:\n   o  redefines basic styles (Normal, Heading1, etc.) rather than\n\
    \      creating new styles,\n   o  updates the boilerplate according to BCP 78,\n\
    \   o  uses more conventional methods for autonumbered references and\n      figures,\
    \ including support for name-based references (e.g.,\n      \"[Tou2005]\"), and\n\
    \   o  supports direct output to a printer from the .doc source, as well\n   \
    \   as RFC-3285-style 'print to text' with post-processing on Windows-\n     \
    \ based PCs.\n   This document assumes familiarity with Microsoft Windows operating\n\
    \   systems and the Word application.\n"
- title: 2.  Use
  contents:
  - "2.  Use\n   To use this template, double-click on it in Windows (it may work\
    \ in\n   MacOS and/or OpenOffice, but this has not been confirmed).  The\n   result\
    \ should be a 'new' document.  Do NOT open this document from\n   within Word,\
    \ e.g., via the File->Open menu; this will edit the\n   template, rather than\
    \ using the template to create a new template-\n   based document.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Setting up Your Version of Word to Edit RFCs
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Setting up Your Version of Word to Edit RFCs\n   Unfortunately, Word does\
    \ not have a way to save some useful settings\n   in a template.  It may be useful\
    \ to configure autoformatting to avoid\n   using smart quotes or hyphens.  However,\
    \ this template is compatible\n   with these features as its post-processor script\
    \ translates such non-\n   standard character codes into their RFC-compatible\
    \ ASCII equivalents.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Editing
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Editing\n   The template provides a number of styles for use (for details,\
    \ see\n   Appendix A).  Some are redefined internal styles and some are new, as\n\
    \   follows.  Throughout the document, avoid the use of bold, italics, or\n  \
    \ any other character formatting, as well as any graphics or paragraph\n   or\
    \ table borders.  Smart hyphens and quotes need not be avoided and\n   will be\
    \ translated during post-processing.\n   The current styles allow existing hyphens\
    \ to break (wrap) across\n   lines, but do not add hyphenation.  To insert a non-breaking\
    \ hyphen,\n   type <CTL-_> (control-underscore); this is particularly useful in\n\
    \   URLs, which are more readable if not line-wrapped.\n   Note that it is critical\
    \ NOT to use any styles other than those\n   provided by this template.\n   o\
    \  Redefined internal styles for general use:\n      Normal, Heading1-9, Caption,\
    \ Header, Footer:\n         Use in the normal fashion.  Tabs can be used as desired.\n\
    \   o  New styles:\n      RFC Title:\n         For the document title only.\n\
    \      RFC Figure:\n         For ASCII-art figures.  Single spaced, kept together.\n\
    \      RFC List Bullet:\n         For bulleted lists.\n      RFC List Numbered:\n\
    \         For numbered lists.  Use 'restart numbering' as desired for new\n  \
    \       list sequences.\n      RFC References:\n         For normative and informative\
    \ references.  Do not restart\n         numbering for informative references.\n\
    \         NOTE: references can use an alternate unnumbered style that\n      \
    \   relies on use of Word's bookmark feature to set cross-reference\n        \
    \ tags.\n      RFC App:\n         For appendix titles, using \"Appendix A.\" format.\
    \  Starts at the\n         top of a new page.  If appendices are used, start the\n\
    \         references (after appendices) at the top of a new page (insert\n   \
    \      'page break').\n      RFC App H1-5:\n         For appendix headings (\"\
    A.1.\" format).\n         NOTE: these headings will NOT auto-renumber when\n \
    \        promoted/demoted in outline mode.\n   o  Redefined internal styles not\
    \ generally accessed by users:\n      TOC1-9:\n         For table of contents\
    \ entries.\n      RFC Instructions:\n         For instructions to authors.  These\
    \ notes must be deleted.\n      RFC H1 - no num:\n         For unnumbered headings\
    \ in end boilerplate text.\n      RFC H1 - no TOC no num:\n         For unnumbered,\
    \ unlisted (in TOC) headings in front boilerplate\n         text.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Saving the File
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Saving the File\n   The template is provided as a Word 97-2003 \".dot\"\
    \ template; Word 2007\n   uses an XML-based variant called \".dotx\".  Word 2007\
    \ can use \".dot\"\n   templates in \"Compatibility Mode\".  If the file is saved\
    \ in that\n   mode, it has a \".doc\" suffix; if saved in native Word 2007 mode,\
    \ it\n   has a \".docx\" format.  It does not matter which saved file format is\n\
    \   used.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Generating Output
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Generating Output\n   This template supports printing similar output both\
    \ to regular\n   printers (8.5 x 11 inch paper) and as Internet-Draft/RFC-compatible\n\
    \   text files.  Printing to a printer is designed for Windows XP and\n   Vista\
    \ and may work with earlier versions of Windows; it has not been\n   tested with\
    \ other OS's.  The template is currently in a Word 97-2003\n   format (.dot);\
    \ this can be used in \"Compatibility Mode\" in Word 2007.\n   Printing to text\
    \ is supported only for Windows at this time.  There\n   is no current support\
    \ for XML.  Details are provided as follows.\n"
- title: 2.4.1.  Printing Direct to a Printer
  contents:
  - "2.4.1.  Printing Direct to a Printer\n   The template produces output direct\
    \ to a printer that is line-for-\n   line, page-for-page identical with the text-only\
    \ version, with a few\n   minor exceptions:\n   o  Single and double quotes may\
    \ be angled (left quote, right quote),\n      rather than straight, depending\
    \ on whether 'smart quotes' are\n      enabled in Tools->Autocorrect options.\n\
    \   o  Hyphens may print as an em dash or en dash, depending on whether\n    \
    \  'smart hyphens' are enabled in Tools->Autocorrect options.\n"
- title: 2.4.2.  Printing the Text File
  contents:
  - "2.4.2.  Printing the Text File\n   Printing to an ASCII text file is currently\
    \ known to work only on\n   Windows-XP and Windows-Vista PCs; appropriate ASCII-output\
    \ drivers\n   for MacOS or Unix boxes running OpenOffice are not currently known.\n\
    \   To generate .txt output on a Windows-XP or Windows Vista PC, use a\n   two-step\
    \ process.  First, generate a .prn file by printing the\n   document to a text-only\
    \ printer.  Second, apply post-processing to\n   clean up the text and apply 'new\
    \ page' characters.\n   Install the \"Generic/Text Only\" printer, as found under\
    \ \"Generic\" in\n   the available print drivers list.  Configure the printer\
    \ to save to a\n   file or click 'save to file' when printing.  A printed file\
    \ will have\n   a .prn file suffix.\n   The printed output needs to be run through\
    \ a post-processor to\n   generate valid Internet-Draft or RFC formatted text.\
    \  Run the .prn\n   file through the post-processing as described in Appendix\
    \ B.  This\n   performs the following operations:\n   o  Omits <CR>s (converts\
    \ <CR><LF> to <LF> and omits bare <CR>s).\n   o  Converts smart quotes and hyphens\
    \ to their ASCII counterparts.\n   o  Omits blank lines between the footer of\
    \ one page and the header of\n      the next, and inserts a <CTL-L> (form-feed)\
    \ between the two.\n   o  Checks for remaining illegal characters (not printable\
    \ ASCII, CR,\n      LF), as required.\n"
- title: 2.4.3.  XML Support
  contents:
  - "2.4.3.  XML Support\n   There is no current support for XML in this template.\
    \  Although Word\n   2003 provides XML support, its use is counterintuitive to\
    \ most Word\n   users.  XML fields are edited using a separate database editor,\n\
    \   rather than in the native Word input screen.  Future support for XML\n   is\
    \ being considered for a future revision of this template.\n"
- title: 3.  Changes from RFC 3285
  contents:
  - "3.  Changes from RFC 3285\n   This document and the \".dot\" template borrow\
    \ heavily from RFC 3285\n   [6].  Notably, all specifics of point sizes, tab locations,\
    \ and the\n   automatic date fields are directly from that template.  This document\n\
    \   builds on that information as follows.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Heading Styles
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Heading Styles\n   This document redefines Normal, Heading1-9, Header,\
    \ Footer, and\n   Caption, rather than defining new RFC-named styles as in RFC\
    \ 3285.\n   The use of internal style names is required for proper operation of\n\
    \   outline mode, notably when promoting/demoting sections of text with\n   subsequent\
    \ renumbering of headings therein.\n   Note that this use of redefined standard\
    \ styles is the common\n   practice, both in Microsoft-supplied templates as well\
    \ as templates\n   from the IEEE and ACM, among others.\n   Additional heading\
    \ styles RFC App and RFC App H1-9 were added to\n   support alternate numbering\
    \ used in appendices, although these styles\n   exhibit the previous deficiency\
    \ of custom styles in outline mode\n   (will not auto-renumber on promote/demote).\n"
- title: 3.2.  References Style
  contents:
  - "3.2.  References Style\n   There are two different reference styles -- RFC References,\
    \ and RFC\n   References Bookmark.  The former cross-references using numbers\n\
    \   (e.g., [1]); the latter uses Word's bookmarking cross-reference\n   features\
    \ to support name/year cross-references (e.g., [Tou2005]).\n   The latter is expected\
    \ to be the preferred format for future I-Ds and\n   RFCs.\n   RFC References\
    \ is a body text paragraph style that autonumbers based\n   on the \"[1]\" format.\
    \  Again, it is common practice, both among\n   Microsoft-supplied templates as\
    \ well as templates from the IEEE and\n   ACM, to use autonumbered paragraphs\
    \ in the body text for references.\n   This differs from RFC 3285, in which references\
    \ were inserted as\n   endnotes, rather than as main body text.\n   Putting references\
    \ in endnotes has unexpected behavior.  In\n   particular, the reference is defined\
    \ by its first use as a citation\n   and is cross-referenced by subsequent citations.\
    \  Removing the first\n   citation removes the reference entirely, despite other\
    \ cross-\n   references.  This is not the case with body text autonumbered\n \
    \  paragraphs, which persist regardless of which cross-references are\n   deleted.\n\
    \   Note that Word does not provide a way to ensure that all RFC\n   Reference\
    \ paragraphs are cross-referenced, i.e., users can insert\n   references that\
    \ are not cited.  This can be desired, however, e.g.,\n   for bibliographies of\
    \ supplemental material.\n   RFC References Bookmark is a body text paragraph\
    \ style that does not\n   use autonumbering.  Currently, authors are expected\
    \ to manually\n   format their references using name-based tags between square\
    \ brackets\n   (\"[]\").  There is no required format, but a suggested format\
    \ would\n   use the first three letters of the first author, together with the\n\
    \   four numbers of the document year, e.g., for this document's\n   reference\
    \ \"[2]\", the reference would now appear as:\n   [Bra2004]   Bradner, S., \"\
    IETF Rights...\"\n   The author is expected to select the text of the reference\n\
    \   \"[Bra2004]\" and insert a bookmark at that point with whatever name is\n\
    \   convenient for the author.  It can then be cited as usual as a cross-\n  \
    \ reference to the bookmark: [Bra2004].  Note that Word bookmark names\n   must\
    \ start with a letter, and may include numbers but not spaces.\n   When two references\
    \ collide, e.g., for two papers written by Bradner\n   in 2004, a trailing lowercase\
    \ letter should be used to distinguish\n   them, e.g., [Bra2004a] and [Bra2004b].\n"
- title: 3.3.  Boilerplate
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Boilerplate\n   The boilerplate in this template was updated to conform\
    \ with current\n   RFC Editor requirements, notably BCP 78 rights statements,\
    \ as well as\n   pending guidelines for Internet Draft and RFC authors [2][3][5].\n\
    \   The boilerplate is written in regular text, and can be easily edited\n   by\
    \ authors to keep the template up-to-date as BCP 78 is revised.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Simplification
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Simplification\n   Headers and footers use more conventional tabbing to\
    \ control\n   formatting, rather than tables.\n   Users no longer need to avoid\
    \ the use of smart quotes or hyphens;\n   these are automatically translated to\
    \ RFC-compliant ASCII characters\n   during post-processing.\n   A number of styles\
    \ include grouping configuration, designed to\n   provide more readable output.\
    \  In particular, all headings are \"keep\n   with next\" to avoid widowed heading\
    \ lines, and all list items,\n   references, and figure lines are \"keep together\"\
    \ to avoid inadvertent\n   splitting across page boundaries.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Ability to Direct Print and Direct View
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Ability to Direct Print and Direct View\n   This template can print directly\
    \ to a printer, generating output that\n   is line-for-line, page-for-page identical\
    \ with the compliant ASCII\n   text output, excepting minor formatting of hyphens\
    \ and quotes.\n   Further, this template can be previewed in File->Print Preview\
    \ or\n   View->Print Layout, again generating screen images that are line-\n \
    \  for-line, page-for-page identical with the compliant ASCII text\n   output.\
    \  This allows true WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get)\n   editing and printing.\n"
- title: 4.  Compatibility Issues
  contents:
  - "4.  Compatibility Issues\n   There are no known compatibility issues at this\
    \ time.  This version\n   of the template was designed under Windows XP and Word\
    \ 2002, and has\n   also been tested under Windows Vista and Word 2007.  It is\
    \ not yet\n   known whether previous versions of Windows/Word are supported using\n\
    \   this template.\n   As noted in Sec. 3.1, this template redefines predefined\
    \ styles,\n   which is common practice.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   There are many security issues in the general\
    \ use of Microsoft\n   operating systems and applications.  This template is not\
    \ known to\n   expose any new security issues; it contains no macros as developed\n\
    \   and deployed.  The author considered including the MD5 signatures of\n   the\
    \ current versions of the .dot template and .pl post-processor\n   files.  The\
    \ current processor .pl file is included in this document\n   as an appendix.\
    \  The .dot file is updated to track the current\n   requirements of the IETF\
    \ boilerplate, so its MD5 signature cannot be\n   included here, but is posted\
    \ on our website for verification.\n"
