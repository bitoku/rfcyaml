  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 2119 specifies common key words, such as \"MUST\", \"\
    SHOULD\", and\n   \"MAY\", that may be used in protocol specifications.  It says\
    \ that the\n   key words \"are often capitalized,\" which has caused confusion\
    \ about\n   how to interpret non-capitalized words such as \"must\" and \"should\"\
    .\n   This document updates RFC 2119 by clarifying that only UPPERCASE\n   usage\
    \ of the key words have the defined special meanings.  This\n   document is part\
    \ of BCP 14.\n"
- title: 2.  Clarifying Capitalization of Key Words
  contents:
  - "2.  Clarifying Capitalization of Key Words\n   The following change is made to\
    \ [RFC2119]:\n   === OLD ===\n   In many standards track documents several words\
    \ are used to signify\n   the requirements in the specification.  These words\
    \ are often\n   capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should\
    \ be\n   interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines\n\
    \   should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:\n   The\
    \ key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\
    \   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in\
    \ this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\n   === NEW\
    \ ===\n   In many IETF documents, several words, when they are in all capitals\n\
    \   as shown below, are used to signify the requirements in the\n   specification.\
    \  These capitalized words can bring significant clarity\n   and consistency to\
    \ documents because their meanings are well defined.\n   This document defines\
    \ how those words are interpreted in IETF\n   documents when the words are in\
    \ all capitals.\n   o  These words can be used as defined here, but using them\
    \ is not\n      required.  Specifically, normative text does not require the use\n\
    \      of these key words.  They are used for clarity and consistency\n      when\
    \ that is what's wanted, but a lot of normative text does not\n      use them\
    \ and is still normative.\n   o  The words have the meanings specified herein\
    \ only when they are in\n      all capitals.\n   o  When these words are not capitalized,\
    \ they have their normal\n      English meanings and are not affected by this\
    \ document.\n   Authors who follow these guidelines should incorporate this phrase\n\
    \   near the beginning of their document:\n      The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST\
    \ NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL\n      NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\"\
    , \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\",\n      \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\
    \ document are to be interpreted as\n      described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174]\
    \ when, and only when, they\n      appear in all capitals, as shown here.\n  \
    \ === END ===\n"
