- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and the Authentication\n\
    \   Header (AH) provide two mechanisms for protecting data being sent\n   over\
    \ an IPsec Security Association (SA) [IPsec, ESP, AH].  To ensure\n   interoperability\
    \ between disparate implementations, it is necessary\n   to specify a set of mandatory-to-implement\
    \ algorithms to ensure that\n   there is at least one algorithm that all implementations\
    \ will have\n   available.  This document defines the current set of mandatory-to-\n\
    \   implement algorithms for ESP and AH as well as specifying algorithms\n   that\
    \ should be implemented because they may be promoted to mandatory\n   at some\
    \ future time.\n   The nature of cryptography is that new algorithms surface\n\
    \   continuously and existing algorithms are continuously attacked.  An\n   algorithm\
    \ believed to be strong today may be demonstrated to be weak\n   tomorrow.  Given\
    \ this, the choice of mandatory-to-implement algorithm\n   should be conservative\
    \ so as to minimize the likelihood of it being\n   compromised quickly.  Thought\
    \ should also be given to performance\n   considerations as many uses of IPsec\
    \ will be in environments where\n   performance is a concern.\n   Finally, we\
    \ need to recognize that the mandatory-to-implement\n   algorithm(s) may need\
    \ to change over time to adapt to the changing\n   world.  For this reason, the\
    \ selection of mandatory-to-implement\n   algorithms is not included the main\
    \ IPsec, ESP, or AH specifications.\n   It is instead placed in this document.\
    \  As the choice of algorithm\n   changes, only this document should need to be\
    \ updated.\n   Ideally, the mandatory-to-implement algorithm of tomorrow should\n\
    \   already be available in most implementations of IPsec by the time it\n   is\
    \ made mandatory.  To facilitate this, we will attempt to identify\n   such algorithms\
    \ (as they are known today) in this document.  There is\n   no guarantee that\
    \ the algorithms we believe today may be mandatory in\n   the future will in fact\
    \ become so.  All algorithms known today are\n   subject to cryptographic attack\
    \ and may be broken in the future.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements Terminology\n   Keywords \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\" and\n   \"MAY\" that appear in this document are\
    \ to be interpreted as described\n   in [RFC2119].\n   We define some additional\
    \ terms here:\n   SHOULD+     This term means the same as SHOULD.  However, it\
    \ is\n               likely that an algorithm marked as SHOULD+ will be\n    \
    \           promoted at some future time to be a MUST.\n   SHOULD-     This term\
    \ means the same as SHOULD.  However, it is\n               likely that an algorithm\
    \ marked as SHOULD- will be\n               deprecated to a MAY or worse in a\
    \ future version of this\n               document.\n   MUST-       This term means\
    \ the same as MUST.  However, we expect\n               that at some point in\
    \ the future this algorithm will no\n               longer be a MUST.\n"

    \ support one or\n   more security algorithms in common.  This section specifies\
    \ the\n   security algorithm implementation requirements for standards-\n   conformant\
    \ ESP and AH implementations.  The security algorithms\n   actually used for any\
    \ particular ESP or AH security association are\n   determined by a negotiation\
    \ mechanism, such as the Internet Key\n   Exchange (IKE [RFC2409, IKEv2]) or pre-establishment.\n\
    \   Of course, additional standard and proprietary algorithms beyond\n   those\
    \ listed below can be implemented.\n"

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The security of cryptographic-based systems depends\
    \ on both the\n   strength of the cryptographic algorithms chosen and the strength\
    \ of\n   the keys used with those algorithms.  The security also depends on\n\
    \   the engineering and administration of the protocol used by the system\n  \
    \ to ensure that there are no non-cryptographic ways to bypass the\n   security\
    \ of the overall system.\n   This document concerns itself with the selection\
    \ of cryptographic\n   algorithms for the use of ESP and AH, specifically with\
    \ the selection\n   of mandatory-to-implement algorithms.  The algorithms identified\
    \ in\n   this document as \"MUST implement\" or \"SHOULD implement\" are not known\n\
    \   to be broken at the current time, and cryptographic research so far\n   leads\
    \ us to believe that they will likely remain secure into the\n   foreseeable future.\
    \  However, this is not necessarily forever.  We\n   would therefore expect that\
    \ new revisions of this document will be\n   issued from time to time that reflect\
    \ the current best practice in\n   this area.\n"

    \ Authentication Header and\n   IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload.  Each specified\

    \ which do not specify cryptographic algorithm implementation\n   requirements,\
    \ and this document, which specifies such requirements\n   for both [AH] and [ESP].\n\

    \ the use of single DES years ago and has not\n      included it in any new standard\
    \ for some time (see IESG note on\n      the first page of [RFC2407]).  But this\
    \ document represents the\n      first standards-track recognition of that deprecation\
    \ by\n      specifying that implementations SHOULD NOT provide single DES.\n \
    \     The US Government National Institute of Standards and Technology\n     \
    \ (NIST) has formally recognized the weakness of single DES by a\n      notice\
    \ published in the 26 July 2004 US Government Federal\n      Register (Docket\
    \ No. 040602169-4169-01) proposing to withdraw it\n      as a US Government Standard.\
