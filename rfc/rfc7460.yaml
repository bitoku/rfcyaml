  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines a subset of the Management Information
    Base\n   (MIB) for use in energy management of devices within or connected to\n
    \  communication networks.  The MIB modules in this document are\n   designed
    to provide a model for energy management, which includes\n   monitoring for Power
    State and energy consumption of networked\n   elements.  This MIB takes into account
    the \"Energy Management\n   Framework\" [RFC7326], which, in turn, is based on
    the \"Requirements\n   for Energy Management\" [RFC6988].\n   Energy management
    can be applied to devices in communication\n   networks.  Target devices for this
    specification include (but are not\n   limited to) routers, switches, Power over
    Ethernet (PoE) endpoints,\n   protocol gateways for building management systems,
    intelligent\n   meters, home energy gateways, hosts and servers, sensor proxies,
    etc.\n   Target devices and the use cases for Energy Management are discussed\n
    \  in Energy Management Applicability Statement [EMAN-AS].\n   Where applicable,
    device monitoring extends to the individual\n   components of the device and to
    any attached dependent devices.  For\n   example, a device can contain components
    that are independent from a\n   Power State point of view, such as line cards,
    processor cards, hard\n   drives.  A device can also have dependent attached devices,
    such as a\n   switch with PoE endpoints or a power distribution unit with attached\n
    \  endpoints.\n"

    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies MIB\n
    \  modules that are compliant to SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"

  - "3.  Use Cases\n   Requirements for power and energy monitoring for networking
    devices\n   are specified in [RFC6988].  The requirements in [RFC6988] cover\n
    \  devices typically found in communications networks, such as switches,\n   routers,
    and various connected endpoints.  For a power monitoring\n   architecture to be
    useful, it should also apply to facility meters,\n   power distribution units,
    gateway proxies for commercial building\n   control, home automation devices,
    and devices that interface with the\n   utility and/or smart grid.  Accordingly,
    the scope of the MIB modules\n   in this document are broader than that specified
    in [RFC6988].\n   Several use cases for Energy Management have been identified
    in the\n   \"Energy Management (EMAN) Applicability Statement\" [EMAN-AS].\n"

    the concepts specified in the Energy\n   Management Framework [RFC7326] that pertain

    in this\n   document.  This subsection maps concepts developed in the Energy\n

    MIB modules: ENERGY-\n   OBJECT-MIB and POWER-ATTRIBUTES-MIB.  The first, ENERGY-OBJECT-MIB,\n
    \  is focused on measurement of power and energy.  The second, POWER-\n   ATTRIBUTES-MIB,

      - "5.1.1.  ENERGY-OBJECT-MIB\n   The ENERGY-OBJECT-MIB module consists of five
        tables.\n   The first table is the eoMeterCapabilitiesTable.  It indicates
        the\n   instrumentation available for each Energy Object.  Entries in this\n
        \  table indicate which other tables from the ENERGY-OBJECT-MIB and\n   POWER-ATTRIBUTES-MIB
        are available for each Energy Object.  The\n   eoMeterCapabilitiesTable is
        indexed by entPhysicalIndex [RFC6933].\n   The second table is the eoPowerTable.
        \ It reports the power\n   consumption of each Energy Object as well as the
        units, sign,\n   measurement accuracy, and related objects.  The eoPowerTable
        is\n   indexed by entPhysicalIndex.\n   The third table is the eoPowerStateTable.
        \ For each Energy Object, it\n   reports information and statistics about
        the supported Power States.\n   The eoPowerStateTable is indexed by entPhysicalIndex
        and\n   eoPowerStateIndex.\n   The fourth table is the eoEnergyParametersTable.
        \ The entries in this\n   table configure the parameters of energy and demand
        measurement\n   collection.  This table is indexed by eoEnergyParametersIndex.\n
        \  The fifth table is the eoEnergyTable.  The entries in this table\n   provide

    - "5.3.  Power State\n   An Energy Object may have energy-conservation modes called
      \"Power\n   States\".  There may be several intermediate energy-saving modes\n
      \  between the ON and OFF states of a device.\n   Power States, which represent
      universal states of power management of\n   an Energy Object, are specified
      by the eoPowerState MIB object.  The\n   actual Power State is specified by
      the eoPowerOperState MIB object,\n   while the eoPowerAdminState MIB object
      specifies the Power State\n   requested for the Energy Object.  The difference
      between the values\n   of eoPowerOperState and eoPowerAdminState indicates that
      the Energy\n   Object is busy transitioning from eoPowerAdminState into the\n
      \  eoPowerOperState, at which point it will update the content of\n   eoPowerOperState.
      \ In addition, the possible reason for a change in\n   Power State is reported
      in eoPowerStateEnterReason.  Regarding\n   eoPowerStateEnterReason, management
      stations and Energy Objects\n   should support any format of the owner string
      dictated by the local\n   policy of the organization.  It is suggested that
      this name contain\n   at least the reason for the transition change, and one
      or more of the\n   following: IP address, management station name, network manager's\n
      \  name, location, or phone number.\n   The MIB objects eoPowerOperState, eoPowerAdminState,
      and\n   eoPowerStateEnterReason are contained in the eoPowerTable.\n   eoPowerStateTable
      enumerates the maximum power usage in watts for\n   every single supported Power
      State of each Power State Set supported\n   by the Energy Object.  In addition,
      eoPowerStateTable provides\n   additional statistics such as eoPowerStateEnterCount,
      i.e., the\n   number of times an entity has visited a particular Power State,
      and\n   eoPowerStateTotalTime, i.e., the total time spent in a particular\n
      \  Power State of an Energy Object.\n"

        of Power State Sets.\n   An Energy Object can support one or multiple Power
        State Set\n   implementations concurrently.\n   There are currently three
        Power State Sets defined:\n      IEEE1621(256) - [IEEE1621]\n      DMTF(512)
        \    - [DMTF]\n      EMAN(768)     - [RFC7326]\n   The Power State Sets are

        \ The Power State Sets are specified by\n   the PowerStateSet Textual Convention
        (TC) as an IANA-maintained MIB\n   module.  The initial version of this MIB

    - "5.4.  Energy Object Usage Information\n   For an Energy Object, power usage
      is reported using eoPower.  The\n   magnitude of measurement is based on the
      eoPowerUnitMultiplier MIB\n   variable, based on the UnitMultiplier TC.  Power
      measurement\n   magnitude should conform to the IEC 62053-21 [IEC.62053-21]
      and IEC\n   62053-22 [IEC.62053-22] definition of unit multiplier for the SI\n
      \  units of measure (where SI is the International System of Units).\n   Measured
      values are represented in SI units obtained by BaseValue *\n   10 raised to
      the power of the unit multiplier.\n   For example, if current power usage of
      an Energy Object is 3, it\n   could be 3 W, 3 mW, 3 kW, or 3 MW, depending on
      the value of\n   eoPowerUnitMultiplier.  Note that other measurements throughout
      the\n   two MIB modules in this document use the same mechanism, including\n
      \  eoPowerStatePowerUnitMultiplier, eoEnergyUnitMultiplier, and\n   oACPwrAttributesPowerUnitMultiplier.\n
      \  In addition to knowing the usage and magnitude, it is useful to know\n   how
      an eoPower measurement was obtained.  A Network Management System\n   (NMS)
      can use this to account for the accuracy and nature of the\n   reading between
      different implementations.  eoPowerMeasurementLocal\n   describes whether the
      measurements were made at the device itself or\n   from a remote source.  The
      eoPowerMeasurementCaliber describes the\n   method that was used to measure
      the power and can distinguish actual\n   or estimated values.  There may be
      devices in the network that may\n   not be able to measure or report power consumption.
      \ For those\n   devices, the object eoPowerMeasurementCaliber shall report that
      the\n   measurement mechanism is \"unavailable\" and the eoPower measurement\n
      \  shall be \"0\".\n   The nameplate power rating of an Energy Object is specified
      in\n   eoPowerNameplate MIB object.\n"

    - "5.5.  Optional Power Usage Attributes\n   The optional POWER-ATTRIBUTES-MIB
      module can be implemented to\n   further describe power attributes usage measurement.
      \ The POWER-\n   ATTRIBUTES-MIB module is aligned with the IEC 61850 7-2 standard
      to\n   describe alternating current (AC) measurements.\n   The POWER-ATTRIBUTES-MIB
      module contains a primary table,\n   eoACPwrAttributesTable, that defines power
      attributes measurements\n   for supported entPhysicalIndex entities, as a sparse
      extension of the\n   eoPowerTable (with entPhysicalIndex as primary index).
      \ This\n   eoACPwrAttributesTable table contains such information as the\n   configuration
      (single phase, DEL 3 phases, WYE 3 phases), frequency,\n   power accuracy, total
      active/reactive power/apparent power, amperage,\n   and voltage.\n   In case
      of three-phase power, an additional table is populated with\n   power attributes
      measurements per phase (hence, double indexed by the\n   entPhysicalIndex and
      a phase index).  This table, describes\n   attributes specific to either WYE
      or DEL configurations.\n   In a DEL configuration, the eoACPwrAttributesDelPhaseTable
      describes\n   the phase-to-phase power attributes measurements, i.e., voltage.
      \ In\n   a DEL configuration, the current is equal in all three phases.\n   In
      a WYE configuration, the eoACPwrAttributesWyePhaseTable describes\n   the phase-to-neutral
      power attributes measurements, i.e., voltage,\n   current, active/reactive/apparent
      power, and power factor.\n"

    - "5.6.  Optional Energy Measurement\n   It is only relevant to measure energy
      and demand when there are\n   actual power measurements obtained from measurement
      hardware.  If the\n   eoPowerMeasurementCaliber MIB object has values of unavailable,\n
      \  unknown, estimated, or presumed, then the energy and demand values\n   are
      not useful.\n   Two tables are introduced to characterize energy measurement
      of an\n   Energy Object: eoEnergyTable and eoEnergyParametersTable.  Both\n
      \  energy and demand information can be represented via the\n   eoEnergyTable.
      \ Demand information can be represented.  The\n   eoEnergyParametersTable consists
      of the parameters defining\n   eoEnergyParametersIndex -- an index for the Energy
      Object,\n   eoEnergyObjectIndex -- linked to the entPhysicalIndex of the Energy\n
      \  Object, the duration of measurement intervals in seconds,\n   (eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength),
      the number of successive\n   intervals to be stored in the eoEnergyTable,\n
      \  (eoEnergyParametersIntervalNumber), the type of measurement technique\n   (eoEnergyParametersIntervalMode),
      and a sample rate used to calculate\n   the average (eoEnergyParametersSampleRate).
      \ Judicious choice of the\n   sampling rate will ensure accurate measurement
      of energy while not\n   imposing an excessive polling burden.\n   There are
      three eoEnergyParametersIntervalMode types used for energy\n   measurement collection:
      period, sliding, and total.  The choices of\n   the three different modes of
      collection are based on IEC standard\n   61850-7-4 [IEC.61850-7-4].  Note that
      multiple\n   eoEnergyParametersIntervalMode types MAY be configured\n   simultaneously.
      \ It is important to note that for a given Energy\n   Object, multiple modes
      (periodic, total, sliding window) of energy\n   measurement collection can be
      configured with the use of\n   eoEnergyParametersIndex.  However, simultaneous
      measurement in\n   multiple modes for a given Energy Object depends on the Energy
      Object\n   capability.\n   These three eoEnergyParametersIntervalMode types
      are illustrated by\n   the following three figures, for which:\n      - The
      horizontal axis represents the current time, with the symbol\n        <--- L
      ---> expressing the eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength and\n        the eoEnergyCollectionStartTime
      is represented by S1, S2, S3,\n        S4, eoEnergyParametersIntervalNumber.\n
      \     - The vertical axis represents the time interval of sampling and\n        the
      value of eoEnergyConsumed can be obtained at the end of the\n        sampling
      period.  The symbol =========== denotes the duration of\n        the sampling

      can be\n   set to \"900 seconds\" or 15 minutes and the number of consecutive\n
      \  intervals over which the maximum energy is calculated\n   (eoEnergyParametersIntervalNumber)
      as \"10\".  The sampling rate\n   internal to the Energy Object for measurement
      of power usage\n   (eoEnergyParametersSampleRate) can be \"1000 milliseconds\",
      as set by\n   the Energy Object as a reasonable value.  Then, the\n   eoEnergyParametersStatus
      is set to active to indicate that the Energy\n   Object should start monitoring
      the usage per the eoEnergyTable.\n   The indices for the eoEnergyTable are eoEnergyParametersIndex,
      which\n   identifies the index for the setting of energy measurement collection\n
      \  Energy Object, and eoEnergyCollectionStartTime, which denotes the\n   start
      time of the energy measurement interval based on sysUpTime\n   [RFC3418].  The
      value of eoEnergyComsumed is the measured energy\n   consumption over the time
      interval specified\n   (eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength) based on the Energy
      Object\n   internal sampling rate (eoEnergyParametersSampleRate).  While\n   choosing
      the values for the eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength and\n   eoEnergyParametersSampleRate,
      it is recommended to take into\n   consideration both the network element resources
      adequate to process\n   and store the sample values and the mechanism used to
      calculate the\n   eoEnergyConsumed.  The units are derived from eoEnergyUnitMultiplier.\n
      \  For example, eoEnergyConsumed can be \"100\" with\n   eoEnergyUnitMultiplier
      equal to 0, the measured energy consumption of\n   the Energy Object is 100
      watt-hours.  The eoEnergyMaxConsumed is the\n   maximum energy observed and
      that can be \"150 watt-hours\".\n   The eoEnergyTable has a buffer to retain
      a certain number of\n   intervals, as defined by eoEnergyParametersIntervalNumber.
      \ If the\n   default value of \"10\" is kept, then the eoEnergyTable contains
      10\n   energy measurements, including the maximum.\n   Here is a brief explanation
      of how the maximum energy can be\n   calculated.  The first observed energy
      measurement value is taken to\n   be the initial maximum.  With each subsequent
      measurement, based on\n   numerical comparison, maximum energy may be updated.
      \ The maximum\n   value is retained as long as the measurements are taking place.\n
      \  Based on periodic polling of this table, an NMS could compute the\n   maximum
      over a longer period, e.g., a month, 3 months, or a year.\n"

  - "6.  Discovery\n   It is probable that most Energy Objects will require the\n
    \  implementation of the ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB [RFC7461] as a\n   prerequisite
    for this MIB module.  In such a case, the eoPowerTable\n   of the EMAN-ENERGY-OBJECT-MIB
    is cross-referenced with the eoTable of\n   ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB via entPhysicalIndex.
    \ Every Energy Object\n   MUST implement entPhysicalIndex, entPhysicalClass, entPhysicalName,\n
    \  and entPhysicalUUID from the ENTITY-MIB [RFC6933].  As the primary\n   index
    for the Energy Object, entPhysicalIndex is used: it\n   characterizes the Energy
    Object in the ENERGY-OBJECT-MIB and the\n   POWER-ATTRIBUTES-MIB MIB modules (this
    document).\n   The NMS must first poll the ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB MIB module\n
    \  [RFC7461], if available, in order to discover all the Energy Objects\n   and
    the relationships between those Energy Objects.  In the ENERGY-\n   OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB
    module tables, the Energy Objects are indexed by\n   the entPhysicalIndex.\n   From
    there, the NMS must poll the eoPowerStateTable (specified in the\n   ENERGY-OBJECT-MIB
    module in this document), which enumerates, amongst\n   other things, the maximum
    power usage.  As the entries in\n   eoPowerStateTable table are indexed by the
    Energy Object\n   (entPhysicalIndex) and by the Power State Set (eoPowerStateIndex),\n
    \  the maximum power usage is discovered per Energy Object, and the\n   power
    usage per Power State of the Power State Set.  In other words,\n   reading the
    eoPowerStateTable allows the discovery of each Power\n   State within every Power
    State Set supported by the Energy Object.\n   The MIB module may be populated
    with the Energy Object relationship\n   information, which have its own Energy
    Object index value\n   (entPhysicalIndex).  However, the Energy Object relationship
    must be\n   discovered via the ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB module.\n   Finally,
    the NMS can monitor the power attributes with the POWER-\n   ATTRIBUTES-MIB MIB
    module, which reuses the entPhysicalIndex to index\n   the Energy Object.\n"

      the ENTITY-MIB module that lists the physical\n   entities of a networking device
      (router, switch, etc.)  and those\n   physical entities indexed by entPhysicalIndex.
      \ From an energy-\n   management standpoint, the physical entities that consume
      or produce\n   energy are of interest.\n   [RFC3433] defines the ENTITY-SENSOR
      MIB module that provides a\n   standardized way of obtaining information (current
      value of the\n   sensor, operational status of the sensor, and the data-unit\n
      \  precision) from sensors embedded in networking devices.  Sensors are\n   associated
      with each index of the entPhysicalIndex of the ENTITY-MIB\n   [RFC6933].  While
      the focus of the Monitoring and Control MIB for\n   Power and Energy is on measurement
      of power usage of networking\n   equipment indexed by the ENTITY-MIB, this MIB
      supports a customized\n   power scale for power measurement and different Power
      States of\n   networking equipment and the functionality to configure the Power\n
      \  States.\n   The Energy Objects are modeled by the entPhysicalIndex through
      the\n   entPhysicalEntity MIB object specified in the eoTable in the ENERGY-\n
      \  OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB MIB module [RFC7461].\n   The ENTITY-SENSOR MIB [RFC3433]
      does not have the ANSI C12.x accuracy\n   classes required for electricity (e.g.,
      1%, 2%, and 0.5% accuracy\n   classes).  Indeed, entPhySensorPrecision [RFC3433]
      represents \"The\n   number of decimal places of precision in fixed-point sensor
      values\n   returned by the associated entPhySensorValue object\".  The ANSI
      and\n   IEC standards are used for power measurement and these standards\n   require
      that we use an accuracy class, not the scientific-number\n   precision model
      specified in RFC3433.  The eoPowerAccuracy MIB object\n   models this accuracy.
      \ Note that eoPowerUnitMultipler represents the\n   scale factor per IEC 62053-21
      [IEC.62053-21] and IEC 62053-22\n   [IEC.62053-22], which is a more logical
      representation for power\n   measurements (compared to entPhySensorScale), with
      the mantissa and\n   the exponent values X * 10 ^ Y.\n   Power measurements
      specifying the qualifier 'UNITS' for each measured\n   value in watts are used
      in the LLDP-EXT-MED-MIB, Power Ethernet\n   [RFC3621], and UPS [RFC1628] MIBs.
      \ The same 'UNITS' qualifier is\n   used for the power measurement values.\n
      \  One cannot assume that the ENTITY-MIB and ENTITY-SENSOR MIBs are\n   implemented
      for all Energy Objects that need to be monitored.  A\n   typical example is
      a converged building gateway, which can monitor\n   other devices in a building
      and provides a proxy between SNMP and a\n   protocol like BACnet.  Another example
      is the home energy controller.\n   In such cases, the eoPhysicalEntity value
      contains the zero value,\n   using the PhysicalIndexOrZero Textual Convention.\n
      \  The eoPower is similar to entPhySensorValue [RFC3433] and the\n   eoPowerUnitMultipler

      data centers and\n   buildings make use of Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS).
      \ To\n   protect critical assets, a UPS can be restricted to a particular\n
      \  subset or domain of the network.  UPS usage typically lasts only for\n   a
      finite period of time, until normal power supply is restored.\n   Planning is
      required to decide on the capacity of the UPS based on\n   output power and
      duration of probable power outage.  To properly\n   provision UPS power in a
      data center or building, it is important to\n   first understand the total demand
      required to support all the\n   entities in the site.  This demand can be assessed
      and monitored via\n   the Monitoring and Control MIB for Power and Energy.\n
      \  The UPS MIB [RFC1628] provides information on the state of the UPS\n   network.
      \ Implementation of the UPS MIB is useful at the aggregate\n   level of a data
      center or a building.  The MIB module contains\n   several groups of variables:\n
      \     - upsIdent: Identifies the UPS entity (name, model, etc.).\n      - upsBattery
      group: Indicates the battery state (upsbatteryStatus,\n        upsEstimatedMinutesRemaining,

      the output from the UPS (number of\n        output lines, voltage, current,
      etc.)\n      - upsAlarms: Indicates the various alarm events.\n   The measurement
      of power in the UPS MIB is in volts, amperes, and\n   watts.  The units of power
      measurement are root mean square (RMS)\n   volts and RMS amperes.  They are
      not based on the\n   EntitySensorDataScale and EntitySensorDataPrecision of

      Energy and the UPS\n   MIB may be implemented on the same UPS SNMP agent, without

      (LLDP) is a Data Link Layer\n   protocol used by network devices to advertise
      their identities,\n   capabilities, and interconnections on a LAN network.\n
      \  The Media Endpoint Discovery is an enhancement of LLDP, known as\n   LLDP-MED.
      \ The LLDP-MED enhancements specifically address voice\n   applications.  LLDP-MED
      covers six basic areas: capability discovery,\n   LAN speed and duplex discovery,
      network policy discovery, location\n   identification discovery, inventory discovery,
      and power discovery.\n   Of particular interest to the current MIB module is
      the power\n   discovery, which allows the endpoint device (such as a PoE phone)
      to\n   convey power requirements to the switch.  In power discovery,\n   LLDP-MED
      has four Type-Length-Values (TLVs): power type, power\n   source, power priority,
      and power value.  Respectively, those TLVs\n   provide information related to
      the type of power (power sourcing\n   entity versus powered device), how the
      device is powered (from the\n   line, from a backup source, from external power
      source, etc.), the\n   power priority (how important is it that this device
      has power?), and\n   how much power the device needs.\n   The power priority
      specified in the LLDP-MED MIB [LLDP-MED-MIB]\n   actually comes from the Power-over-Ethernet
      MIB [RFC3621].  If the\n   Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] is supported, the
      exact value from\n   the pethPsePortPowerPriority [RFC3621] is copied over into
      the\n   lldpXMedRemXPoEPDPowerPriority [LLDP-MED-MIB]; otherwise, the value\n
      \  in lldpXMedRemXPoEPDPowerPriority is \"unknown\".  From the Monitoring\n
      \  and Control MIB for Power and Energy, it is possible to identify the\n   pethPsePortPowerPriority
      [RFC3621], via the eoethPortIndex and\n   eoethPortGrpIndex.\n   The lldpXMedLocXPoEPDPowerSource
      [LLDP-MED-MIB] is similar to\n   eoPowerMeasurementLocal in indicating if the
      power for an attached\n   device is local or from a remote device.  If the LLDP-MED
      MIB is\n   supported, the following mapping can be applied to the\n   eoPowerMeasurementLocal:

  title: 9.  MIB Definitions
- contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined
    in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
    \ Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n
    \  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment
    without proper protection opens devices to attack.  These\n   are the tables and
    objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:\n      - Unauthorized changes to
    the eoPowerOperState (via the\n        eoPowerAdminState ) MAY disrupt the power
    settings of the\n        differentEnergy Objects and, therefore, the state of\n
    \       functionality of the respective Energy Objects.\n      - Unauthorized
    changes to the eoEnergyParametersTable MAY disrupt\n        energy measurement
    in the eoEnergyTable table.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include
    adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using
    IPsec),\n   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to\n
    \  access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this\n   MIB
    module.\n   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by
    the\n   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming\n   compliance
    to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for\n   authentication and privacy
    via the User-based Security Model (USM)\n   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm
    [RFC3826].  Implementations\n   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security
    Model (TSM)\n   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH\n
    \  [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior
    to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3
    and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility
    to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module
    is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals
    (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)
    them.\n   In certain situations, energy and power monitoring can reveal\n   sensitive
    information about individuals' activities and habits.\n   Implementors of this
    specification should use appropriate privacy\n   protections as discussed in Section
    9 of RFC 6988 and monitoring of\n   individuals and homes should only occur with
    proper authorization.\n"
