    configured to use Kerberos for authentication as\n   the first step in establishing
    a secure SNMPv3 link between the\n   Portal Service (PS) logical element [2,3]

    proposes a sub-option for the CCC DHCP option.\n   Configuration of a class of
    CableLabs client devices described in [2]\n   and [3] will require a DHCP sub-option
    to provide the client with the\n   network address of a KDC server in the cable
    operator's data network.\n   The class of devices assumed in [2] and [3] is unlike
    the class of\n   devices considered in [1], which perform a DNS lookup of the
    Kerberos\n   Realm name to find the KDC server network address.\n   This document
    proposes a sub-option of the CCC DHCP option code for\n   use with CableLabs client
    devices.  The proposed sub-option encodes\n   an identifier for the network address
    of each of one or more Key\n   Distribution Center servers with which the CableLabs
    client device\n   exchanges security information.\n   The key words \"MUST\",
    \"MUST NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\" and \"MAY\" in\n   this document are
    to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119\n   [4].\n"

  - "2.  Key Distribution Center IP Address Sub-option\n   CableHome specifications
    will specify the Key Distribution Center\n   network address encoding as a sub-option
    of the CCC DHCP Option code.\n   This field will be used to inform the client
    device of the network\n   address of one or more Key Distribution Center servers.\n
    \  The encoding of the KDC Server Address sub-option will adhere to the\n   format
    of an IPv4 address.  The minimum length for this option is 4\n   octets, and the
    length MUST always be a multiple of 4.  If multiple\n   KDC Servers are listed,
    they MUST be listed in decreasing order of\n   priority.  The format of the KDC
    Server Address sub-option of the CCC\n   option code is as shown below:\n    SubOpt
    \ Len      Address 1               Address 2\n   +------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--\n
    \  |  10  |  n  |  a1 |  a2 |  a3 |  a4 |  a1 |  a2 |  ...\n   +------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--\n"

    for authentication\n   and security, i.e., it does not provide security in excess
    of what\n   DHCP is (or will be) providing.  Potential exposures to attack in
    the\n   DHCP protocol are discussed in section 7 of the DHCP protocol\n   specification
    [5] and in Authentication for DHCP Messages [6].\n   The CCC option can be used
    to misdirect network traffic by providing\n   incorrect DHCP server addresses,
    incorrect provisioning server\n   addresses, and incorrect Kerberos realm names
    to a CableLabs client\n   device.  This misdirection can lead to several threat
    scenarios.  A\n   Denial of Service (DoS) attack can result from address information\n
    \  being simply invalid.  A man-in-the-middle attack can be mounted by\n   providing
    addresses to a potential snooper.  A malicious service\n   provider can steal
    customers from the customer selected service\n   provider, by altering the Kerberos
    realm designation.\n   These threats are mitigated by several factors.\n   Within
    the cable delivery architecture required by CableLabs'\n   PacketCable, DOCSIS,
    and CableHome specifications, the DHCP client is\n   connected to a network through
    a cable modem and the Cable Modem\n   Termination System (CMTS).  The CMTS is
    explicitly configured with a\n   set of DHCP servers to which DHCP requests are
    forwarded.  Further, a\n   correctly configured CMTS will only allow downstream
    traffic from\n   specific IP addresses/ ranges.\n   Assuming that server addresses
    were successfully spoofed to the point\n   that a malicious client device was
    able to contact a KDC, the client\n   device must still present valid certificates
    to the KDC before being\n   service enabled.  Given the computational overhead
    of the certificate\n   validation process, this situation could present a DoS
    opportunity.\n   It is possible for a malicious (although certificate enabled)
    service\n   provider to redirect a customer from the customer's selected service\n
    \  provider.  It is assumed that all service providers permitted onto an\n   access
    providers network are trusted entities that will cooperate to\n   ensure peaceful
    coexistence.  If a service provider is found to be\n   redirecting customers,
    this should be handled as an administrative\n   matter between the access provider
    and the service provider.\n   Another safeguard that can be taken by service providers
    to limit\n   their exposure to their KDC server(s) is to configure their network\n
    \  so that the KDC(s) reside on a separate subnetwork.\n   Service providers can
    further protect their KDC server(s) by placing\n   a firewall in front of the
    KDC(s) only allowing connections needed\n   for its current provisioning processes.
    \ The IP temporary addresses\n   given the client devices from the DHCP server
    could be sent directly\n   to the firewall from the DHCP server to open a hole
    for Kerberos\n   messages only for those particular IP addresses for a short period
    of\n   time.  If this was used it would be recommended that service\n   providers
    authenticate their DHCP server to the KDC as well.  This\n   could be done via
    password authentication rather than digital\n   certificate due to the co-location
    of the DHCP server to the KDC.\n   Finally, Kerberos requires mutual client-server
    authentication.\n   Therefore, the client device must authenticate itself with
    its\n   digital certificate and the KDC is required to authenticate it to the\n
    \  client device.  If a hacker tries to redirect the client device by\n   replacing
    the service provider-configured KDC Server Address sub-\n   option with another
    IP address, it is not likely to be a valid\n   service provider's KDC server and
    authentication will fail.\n"
