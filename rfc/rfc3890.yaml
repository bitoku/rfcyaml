  - "1.  Introduction\n   This specification is structured in the following way: In\
    \ this\n   section, some information regarding SDP bandwidth modifiers, and\n\
    \   different mechanisms that affect transport overhead are asserted.  In\n  \
    \ section 3, the problems found are described, including problems that\n   are\
    \ not solved by this specification.  In section 4 the scope of the\n   problems\
    \ this specification solves is presented.  Section 5 contains\n   the requirements\
    \ applicable to the problem scope.  Section 6 defines\n   the solution, which\
    \ is a new bandwidth modifier, and a new maximum\n   packet rate attribute.  Section\
    \ 7 looks at the protocol interaction\n   for SIP, RTSP, and SAP.  The security\
    \ considerations are discussed in\n   section 8.  The remaining sections are the\
    \ necessary IANA\n   considerations, acknowledgements, reference list, author's\
    \ address,\n   and copyright and IPR notices.\n   Today the Session Description\
    \ Protocol (SDP) [1] is used in several\n   types of applications.  The original\
    \ application is session\n   information and configuration for multicast sessions\
    \ announced with\n   Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) [5].  SDP is also a vital\n\
    \   component in media negotiation for the Session Initiation Protocol\n   (SIP)\
    \ [6] by using the offer answer model [7].  The Real-Time\n   Streaming Protocol\
    \ (RTSP) [8] also makes use of SDP to declare to the\n   client what media and\
    \ codec(s) comprise a multi-media presentation.\n"
- title: 1.1.  The Bandwidth Attribute
  contents:
  - "1.1.  The Bandwidth Attribute\n   In SDP [1] there exists a bandwidth attribute,\
    \ which has a modifier\n   used to specify what type of bit-rate the value refers\
    \ to.  The\n   attribute has the following form:\n      b=<modifier>:<value>\n\
    \   Today there are four defined modifiers used for different purposes.\n"
- title: 1.1.1.  Conference Total
  contents:
  - "1.1.1.  Conference Total\n   The Conference Total is indicated by giving the\
    \ modifier \"CT\".\n   Conference total gives a maximum bandwidth that a conference\
    \ session\n   will use.  Its purpose is to decide if this session can co-exist\
    \ with\n   any other sessions, defined in RFC 2327 [1].\n"
- title: 1.1.2.  Application Specific Maximum
  contents:
  - "1.1.2.  Application Specific Maximum\n   The Application Specific maximum bandwidth\
    \ is indicated by the\n   modifier \"AS\".  The interpretation of this attribute\
    \ is dependent on\n   the application's notion of maximum bandwidth.  For an RTP\n\
    \   application, this attribute is the RTP session bandwidth as defined\n   in\
    \ RFC 3550 [4].  The session bandwidth includes the bandwidth that\n   the RTP\
    \ data traffic will consume, including the lower layers, down\n   to the IP layer.\
    \  Therefore, the bandwidth is in most cases\n   calculated over RTP payload,\
    \ RTP header, UDP, and IP, defined in RFC\n   2327 [1].\n"
- title: 1.1.3.  RTCP Report Bandwidth
  contents:
  - "1.1.3.  RTCP Report Bandwidth\n   In RFC 3556 [9], two bandwidth modifiers are\
    \ defined.  These\n   modifiers, \"RS\" and \"RR\", define the amount of bandwidth\
    \ that is\n   assigned for RTCP reports by active data senders and RTCP reports\
    \ by\n   other participants (receivers), respectively.\n"
- title: 1.2.  IPv6 and IPv4
  contents:
  - "1.2.  IPv6 and IPv4\n   Today there are two IP versions, 4 [14] and 6 [13], used\
    \ in parallel\n   on the Internet, creating problems.  However, there exist a\
    \ number of\n   possible transition mechanisms.\n   -  The nodes which wish to\
    \ communicate must share the IP version;\n      typically this is done by deploying\
    \ dual-stack nodes.  For\n      example, an IPv4 only host cannot communicate\
    \ with an IPv6 only\n      host.\n   -  If communication between nodes which do\
    \ not share a protocol\n      version is required, use of a translation or proxying\
    \ mechanism\n      would be required.  Work is underway to specify such a mechanism\n\
    \      for this purpose.\n      ------------------               ----------------------\n\

    \ or proxying between IPv6 and IPv4 addresses.\n   -  IPv6 nodes belonging to\
    \ different domains running IPv6, but\n      lacking IPv6 connectivity between\
    \ them, solve this by tunneling\n      over the IPv4 net, see Figure 2.  Basically,\
    \ the IPv6 packets are\n      sent as payload in IPv4 packets between the tunneling\
    \ end-points\n      at the edge of each IPv6 domain.  The bandwidth required over\
    \ the\n      IPv4 domain will be different from IPv6 domains.  However, as the\n\
    \      tunneling is normally not performed by the application end-point,\n   \
    \   this scenario can not usually be taken into consideration.\n      ---------------\

    \   Figure 2. Tunneling through a IPv4 domain\n   IPv4 has a minimum header size\
    \ of 20 bytes, while the fixed part of\n   the IPv6 header is 40 bytes.\n   The\
    \ difference in header sizes means that the bit-rate required for\n   the two\
    \ IP versions is different.  The significance of the difference\n   depends on\
    \ the packet rate and payload size of each packet.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.3.  Further Mechanisms that Change the Bandwidth Utilization\n   There exist\
    \ a number of other mechanisms that also may change the\n   overhead at layers\
    \ below media transport.  We will briefly cover a\n   few of these here.\n"
- title: 1.3.1.  IPsec
  contents:
  - "1.3.1.  IPsec\n   IPsec [19] can be used between end points to provide confidentiality\n\
    \   through the application of the IP Encapsulating Security Payload\n   (ESP)\
    \ [21] or integrity protection using the IP Authentication Header\n   (AH) [20]\
    \ of the media stream.  The addition of the ESP and AH\n   headers increases each\
    \ packet's size.\n   To provide virtual private networks, complete IP packets\
    \ may be\n   encapsulated between an end node and the private networks security\n\
    \   gateway, thus providing a secure tunnel that ensures confidentiality,\n  \
    \ integrity, and authentication of the packet stream.  In this case,\n   the extra\
    \ IP and ESP header will significantly increase the packet\n   size.\n"
- title: 1.3.2.  Header Compression
  contents:
  - "1.3.2.  Header Compression\n   Another mechanism that alters the actual overhead\
    \ over links is\n   header compression.  Header compression uses the fact that\
    \ most\n   network protocol headers have either static or predictable values in\n\
    \   their fields within a packet stream.  Compression is normally only\n   done\
    \ on a per hop basis, i.e., on a single link.  The normal reason\n   for doing\
    \ header compression is that the link has fairly limited\n   bandwidth and significant\
    \ gain in throughput is achieved.\n   There exist several different header compression\
    \ standards.  For\n   compressing IP headers only, there is RFC 2507 [10].  For\
    \ compressing\n   packets with IP/UDP/RTP headers, CRTP [11] was created at the\
    \ same\n   time.  More recently, the Robust Header Compression (ROHC) working\n\
    \   group has been developing a framework and profiles [12] for\n   compressing\
    \ certain combinations of protocols, like IP/UDP, and\n   IP/UDP/RTP.\n"

- title: 3.  The Bandwidth Signaling Problems
  contents:
  - "3.  The Bandwidth Signaling Problems\n   When an application wants to use SDP\
    \ to signal the bandwidth required\n   for this application, some problems become\
    \ evident due to the\n   inclusion of the lower layers in the bandwidth values.\n"
- title: 3.1.  What IP Version is Used
  contents:
  - "3.1.  What IP Version is Used\n   If one signals the bandwidth in SDP, for example,\
    \ using \"b=AS:\" as an\n   RTP based application, one cannot know if the overhead\
    \ is calculated\n   for IPv4 or IPv6.  An indication of which protocol has been\
    \ used when\n   calculating the bandwidth values is given by the \"c=\" connection\n\
    \   address line.  This line contains either a multicast group address or\n  \
    \ a unicast address of the data source or sink.  The \"c=\" line's\n   address\
    \ type may be assumed to be of the same type as the one used in\n   the bandwidth\
    \ calculation, although no document specifying this point\n   seems to exist.\n\
    \   In cases of SDP transported by RTSP, this is even less clear.  The\n   normal\
    \ usage for a unicast on-demand streaming session is to set the\n   connection\
    \ data address to a null address.  This null address does\n   have an address\
    \ type, which could be used as an indication.  However,\n   this is also not clarified\
    \ anywhere.\n   Figure 1, illustrates a connection scenario between a streaming\n\
    \   server A and a client B over a translator.  When B receives the SDP\n   from\
    \ A over RTSP, it will be very difficult for B to know what the\n   bandwidth\
    \ values in the SDP represent.  The following possibilities\n   exist:\n   1.\
    \ The SDP is unchanged and the \"c=\" null address is of type IPv4.\n      The\
    \ bandwidth value represents the bandwidth needed in an IPv4\n      network.\n\
    \   2. The SDP has been changed by an Application Level Gateway (ALG).\n     \
    \ The \"c=\" address is changed to an IPv6 type.  The bandwidth value\n      is\
    \ unchanged.\n   3. The SDP is changed and both \"c=\" address type and bandwidth\
    \ value\n      is converted.  Unfortunately, this can seldom be done, see 3.3.\n\
    \   In case 1, the client can understand that the server is located in an\n  \
    \ IPv4 network and that it uses IPv4 overhead when calculating the\n   bandwidth\
    \ value.  The client can almost never convert the bandwidth\n   value, see section\
    \ 3.3.\n   In case 2, the client does not know that the server is in an IPv4\n\
    \   network and that the bandwidth value is not calculated with IPv6\n   overhead.\
    \  In cases where a client uses this value to determine if\n   its end of the\
    \ network has sufficient resources the client will\n   underestimate the required\
    \ bit-rate, potentially resulting in bad\n   application performance.\n   In case\
    \ 3, everything works correctly.  However, this case will be\n   very rare.  If\
    \ one tries to convert the bandwidth value without\n   further information about\
    \ the packet rate, significant errors may be\n   introduced into the value.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Taking Other Mechanisms into Account
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Taking Other Mechanisms into Account\n   Section 1.2 and 1.3 lists a number\
    \ of reasons, like header\n   compression and tunnels, that would change lower\
    \ layer header sizes.\n   For these mechanisms there exist different possibilities\
    \ to take them\n   into account.\n   Using IPsec directly between end-points should\
    \ definitely be known to\n   the application, thus enabling it to take the extra\
    \ headers into\n   account.  However the same problem also exists with the current\
    \ SDP\n   bandwidth modifiers where a receiver is not able to convert these\n\
    \   values taking the IPsec headers into account.\n   It is less likely that an\
    \ application would be aware of the existence\n   of a virtual private network.\
    \  Thus the generality of the mechanism\n   to tunnel all traffic may prevent\
    \ the application from even\n   considering whether it would be possible to convert\
    \ the values.\n   When using header compression, the actual overhead will be less\n\
    \   deterministic, but in most cases an average overhead can be\n   determined\
    \ for a certain application.  If a network node knows that\n   some type of header\
    \ compression is employed, this can be taken into\n   consideration.  For RSVP\
    \ [15], there exists an extension, RFC 3006\n   [16], that allows the data sender\
    \ to inform network nodes about the\n   compressibility of the data flow.  To\
    \ be able to do this with any\n   accuracy, the compression factor and packet\
    \ rate or size is needed,\n   as RFC 3006 provides.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Converting Bandwidth Values
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Converting Bandwidth Values\n   If one would like to convert a bandwidth\
    \ value calculated using IPv4\n   overhead to IPv6 overhead, the packet rate is\
    \ required.  The new\n   bandwidth value for IPv6 is normally \"IPv4 bandwidth\"\
    \ + \"packet rate\"\n   * 20 bytes, where 20 bytes is the usual difference between\
    \ IPv6 and\n   IPv4 headers.  The overhead difference may be some other value\
    \ in\n   cases when IPv4 options [14] or IPv6 extension headers [13] are used.\n\
    \   As converting requires the packet rate of the stream, this is not\n   possible\
    \ in the general case.  Many codecs have either multiple\n   possible packet/frame\
    \ rates or can perform payload format\n   aggregation, resulting in many possible\
    \ rates.  Therefore, some extra\n   information in the SDP will be required. \
    \ The \"a=ptime:\" parameter\n   may be a possible candidate.  However, this parameter\
    \ is normally\n   only used for audio codecs.  Its definition [1] is that it is\
    \ only a\n   recommendation, which the sender may disregard.  A better parameter\n\
    \   is needed.\n"
- title: 3.4.  RTCP Problems
  contents:
  - "3.4.  RTCP Problems\n   When RTCP is used between hosts in IPv4 and IPv6 networks\
    \ over\n   translator, similar problems exist.  The RTCP traffic going from the\n\
    \   IPv4 domain will result in a higher RTCP bit-rate than intended in\n   the\
    \ IPv6 domain due to the larger headers.  This may result in up to\n   a 25% increase\
    \ in required bandwidth for the RTCP traffic.  The\n   largest increase will be\
    \ for small RTCP packets when the number of\n   IPv4 hosts is much larger than\
    \ the number of IPv6 hosts.\n   Fortunately, as RTCP has a limited bandwidth compared\
    \ to RTP, it will\n   only result in a maximum of 1.75% increase of the total\
    \ session\n   bandwidth when RTCP bandwidth is 5% of RTP bandwidth.  The RTCP\n\
    \   randomization may easily result in short term effects of the same\n   magnitude,\

  - "3.5.  Future Development\n   Today there is work in the IETF to design a new\
    \ datagram transport\n   protocol suitable for real-time media.  This protocol\
    \ is called the\n   Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).  It will most\
    \ probably\n   have a different header size than UDP, which is the protocol most\n\
    \   often used for real-time media today.  This results in even more\n   possible\
    \ transport combinations.  This may become a problem if one\n   has the possibility\
    \ of using different protocols, which will not be\n   determined prior to actual\
    \ protocol SETUP.  Thus, pre-calculating\n   this value will not be possible,\
    \ which is one further motivation why\n   a transport independent bandwidth modifier\
    \ is needed.\n   DCCP's congestion control algorithms will control how much bandwidth\n\
    \   can really be utilized.  This may require further work with\n   specifying\
    \ SDP bandwidth modifiers to declare the dynamic\n   possibilities of an application's\
    \ media stream.  For example, min and\n   max media bandwidth the application\
    \ is capable of producing at all,\n   or for media codecs only capable of producing\
    \ certain bit-rates,\n   enumerating possible rates.  However, this is for future\

    \ is that they\n   also include the bandwidth needed for lower layers.  It is\
    \ in many\n   cases difficult to determine which lower layers and their versions\n\
    \   were included in the calculation, especially in the presence of\n   translation\
    \ or proxying between different domains.  This prevents a\n   receiver from determining\
    \ if given bandwidth needs to be converted\n   based on the actual lower layers\
    \ being used.\n   Secondly, an attribute to give the receiver an explicit determination\n\
    \   of the maximum packet rate that will be used does not exist.  This\n   value\

    \ problem of signaling the bit-rate in SDP.  The problems need\n   to be considered\
    \ in other affected protocols and in new protocols\n   being designed.  In the\

    \ that the problems outlined in\n   this document be considered when designing\
    \ solutions for specifying\n   bandwidth in the SDP-NG [17].\n   As this specification\
    \ only targets carrying the bit-rate information\n   within SDP, it will have\
    \ a limited applicability.  As SDP information\n   is normally transported end-to-end\
    \ by an application protocol, nodes\n   between the end-points will not have access\
    \ to the bit-rate\n   information.  It will normally only be the end points that\

    \ to\n   receive the information through a means other than SDP, and that is\n\
    \   outside the scope of this specification.\n   Nevertheless, the bit-rate information\
    \ provided in this specification\n   is sufficient for cases such as first-hop\
    \ resource reservation and\n   admission control.  It also provide information\
    \ about the maximum\n   codec rate, which is independent of lower-level protocols.\n\

- title: 6.2.1.  Usage
  contents:
  - "6.2.1.  Usage\n   A new bandwidth modifier is defined to be used for the following\n\
    \   purposes:\n   -  Resource reservation.  A single bit-rate can be enough for\
    \ use as\n      a resource reservation.  Some characteristics can be derived from\n\
    \      the stream, codec type, etc. In cases where more information is\n     \
    \ needed, another SDP parameter will be required.\n   -  Maximum media codec rate.\
    \  With the definition below of \"TIAS\",\n      the given bit-rate will mostly\
    \ be from the media codec.\n      Therefore, it gives a good indication of the\
    \ maximum codec bit-\n      rate required to be supported by the decoder.\n  \
    \ -  Communication bit-rate required for the stream.  The \"TIAS\" value\n   \
    \   together with \"maxprate\" can be used to determine the maximum\n      communication\
    \ bit-rate the stream will require.  Using session\n      level values or by adding\
    \ all maximum bit-rates from the streams\n      in a session together, a receiver\
    \ can determine if its\n      communication resources are sufficient to handle\
    \ the stream.  For\n      example, a modem user can determine if the session fits\
    \ his\n      modem's capabilities and the established connection.\n   -  Determine\
    \ the RTP session bandwidth and derive the RTCP bandwidth.\n      The derived\
    \ transport dependent attribute will be the RTP session\n      bandwidth in case\
    \ of RTP based transport.  The TIAS value can also\n      be used to determine\
    \ the RTCP bandwidth to use when using implicit\n      allocation.  RTP [4] specifies\
    \ that if not explicitly stated,\n      additional bandwidth, equal to 5% of the\
    \ RTP session bandwidth,\n      shall be used by RTCP.  The RTCP bandwidth can\

- title: 6.2.2.  Definition
  contents:
  - "6.2.2.  Definition\n   A new session and media level bandwidth modifier is defined:\n\
    \      b=TIAS:<bandwidth-value> ; see section 6.6 for ABNF definition.\n   The\
    \ Transport Independent Application Specific Maximum (TIAS)\n   bandwidth modifier\
    \ has an integer bit-rate value in bits per second.\n   A fractional bandwidth\
    \ value SHALL always be rounded up to the next\n   integer.  The bandwidth value\
    \ is the maximum needed by the\n   application (SDP session level) or media stream\
    \ (SDP media level)\n   without counting IP or other transport layers like TCP\
    \ or UDP.\n   At the SDP session level, the TIAS value is the maximal amount of\n\
    \   bandwidth needed when all declared media streams are used.  This MAY\n   be\
    \ less than the sum of all the individual media streams values.\n   This is due\
    \ to the possibility that not all streams have their\n   maximum at the same point\
    \ in time.  This can normally only be\n   verified for stored media streams.\n\
    \   For RTP transported media streams, TIAS at the SDP media level can be\n  \
    \ used to derive the RTP \"session bandwidth\", defined in section 6.2 of\n  \
    \ [4].  In the context of RTP transport, the TIAS value is defined as:\n     \
    \ Only the RTP payload as defined in [4] SHALL be used in the\n      calculation\
    \ of the bit-rate, i.e., excluding the lower layers\n      (IP/UDP) and RTP headers\
    \ including RTP header, RTP header\n      extensions, CSRC list, and other RTP\
    \ profile specific fields.\n      Note that the RTP payload includes both the\
    \ payload format header\n      and the data.  This may allow one to use the same\
    \ value for RTP-\n      based media transport, non-RTP transport, and stored media.\n\
    \   Note 1: The usage of bps is not in accordance with RFC 2327 [1].\n   This\
    \ change has no implications on the parser, only the interpreter\n   of the value\
    \ must be aware.  The change is done to allow for better\n   resolution, and has\
    \ also been used for the RR and RS bandwidth\n   modifiers, see [9].\n   Note\
    \ 2: RTCP bandwidth is not included in the bandwidth value.  In\n   applications\
    \ using RTCP, the bandwidth used by RTCP is either 5% of\n   the RTP session bandwidth\
    \ including lower layers or as specified by\n   the RR and RS modifiers [9]. \

- title: 6.2.3.  Usage Rules
  contents:
  - "6.2.3.  Usage Rules\n   \"TIAS\" is primarily intended to be used at the SDP\

    \ the\n   sum of the media level values for all media streams is larger than\n\
    \   the actual maximum bandwidth need for all streams, it SHOULD be\n   included\
    \ at session level.  However, if present at the session level\n   it SHOULD be\
    \ present also at the media level.  \"TIAS\" SHALL NOT be\n   present at the session\
    \ level unless the same transport protocols is\n   used for all media streams.\
    \  The same transport is used as long as\n   the same combination of protocols\
    \ is used, like IPv6/UDP/RTP.\n   To allow for backwards compatibility with applications\
    \ of SDP that do\n   not implement \"TIAS\", it is RECOMMENDED to also include\
    \ the \"AS\"\n   modifier when using \"TIAS\".  The presence of a value including\n\

- title: 6.3.  Packet Rate Parameter
  contents:
  - "6.3.  Packet Rate Parameter\n   To be able to calculate the bandwidth value including\
    \ the lower\n   layers actually used, a packet rate attribute is also defined.\n\
    \   The SDP session and media level maximum packet rate attribute is\n   defined\
    \ as:\n      a=maxprate:<packet-rate> ; see section 6.6 for ABNF definition.\n\
    \   The <packet-rate> is a floating-point value for the stream's maximum\n   packet\
    \ rate in packets per second.  If the number of packets is\n   variable, the given\
    \ value SHALL be the maximum the application can\n   produce in case of a live\
    \ stream, or for stored on-demand streams,\n   has produced.  The packet rate\
    \ is calculated by adding the number of\n   packets sent within a 1 second window.\
    \  The maxprate is the largest\n   value produced when the window slides over\
    \ the entire media stream.\n   In cases that this can't be calculated, i.e., a\
    \ live stream, a\n   estimated value of the maximum packet rate the codec can\
    \ produce for\n   the given configuration and content SHALL be used.\n   Note:\

    \ level, the \"maxprate\" value is the maximum packet\n   rate calculated over\
    \ all the declared media streams.  If this can't\n   be measured (stored media)\
    \ or estimated (live), the sum of all media\n   level values provides a ceiling\
    \ value.  Note: the value at session\n   level can be less then the sum of the\
    \ individual media streams due to\n   temporal distribution of media stream's\
    \ maximums.  The \"maxprate\"\n   attribute MUST NOT be present at the session\
    \ level if the media\n   streams use different transport.  The attribute MAY be\

    \ for\n   all media streams.\n   \"maxprate\" SHALL be included for all transports\
    \ where a packet rate\n   can be derived and TIAS is included.  For example, if\
    \ you use TIAS\n   and a transport like IP/UDP/RTP, for which the max packet rate\n\
    \   (actual or estimated) can be derived, then \"maxprate\" SHALL be\n   included.\

- title: 6.5.1.  Motivation for this Solution
  contents:
  - "6.5.1.  Motivation for this Solution\n   Giving the exact same RTCP bit-rate\
    \ value to both the IPv4 and IPv6\n   hosts will result in the IPv4 host having\
    \ a higher RTCP sending rate.\n   The sending rate represents the number of RTCP\
    \ packets sent during a\n   given time interval.  The sending of RTCP is limited\
    \ according to\n   rules defined in the RTP specification [4].  For a 100-byte\
    \ RTCP\n   packet (including UDP/IPv4), the IPv4 sender has an approximately 20%\n\
    \   higher sending rate.  This rate falls with larger RTCP packets.  For\n   example,\
    \ 300-byte packets will only give the IPv4 host a 7% higher\n   sending rate.\n\
    \   The above rule for deriving RTCP bandwidth gives the same behavior as\n  \
    \ fixed assignment when the RTP session has traffic parameters giving a\n   large\
    \ TIAS/maxprate ratio.  The two hosts will be fair when the\n   TIAS/maxprate\
    \ ratio is approximately 40 bytes/packet, given 100-byte\n   RTCP packets.  For\
    \ a TIAS/maxprate ratio of 5 bytes/packet, the IPv6\n   host will be allowed to\
    \ send approximately 15-20% more RTCP packets.\n   The larger the RTCP packets\
    \ become, the more it will favor the IPv6\n   host in its sending rate.\n   The\
    \ conclusions is that, within the normal useful combination of\n   transport-independent\
    \ bit rates and packet rates, the difference in\n   fairness between hosts on\
    \ different IP versions with different\n   overhead is acceptable.  For the 20-byte\
    \ difference in overhead\n   between IPv4 and IPv6 headers, the RTCP bandwidth\
    \ actually used in a\n   unicast connection case will not be larger than approximately\
    \ 1% of\n   the total session bandwidth.\n"

    \   for the application.  For example, a single channel AMR-encoded voice\n  \
    \ stream claiming to use 1000 kbps is not reasonable.\n   Please note that some\
    \ of the above security requirements are in\n   conflict with that required to\
    \ make signaling protocols using SDP\n   work through a middlebox, as discussed\
    \ in the security considerations\n   of RFC 3303 [18].\n"
