  - "1.  Introduction\n   Internet mail distinguishes a message from its transport
    and further\n   divides a message between a header and a body [RFC5322].  Internet\n
    \  mail header field values contain a variety of strings that are\n   intended
    to be user-visible.  The range of supported characters for\n   these strings was
    originally limited to [ASCII] in 7-bit form.  MIME\n   [RFC2045] [RFC2046] [RFC2047]
    provides the ability to use additional\n   character sets, but this support is
    limited to body part data and to\n   special encoded-word constructs that were
    only allowed in a limited\n   number of places in header field values.\n   Globalization
    of the Internet requires support of the much larger set\n   of characters provided
    by Unicode [RFC5198] in both mail addresses\n   and most header field values.
    \ Additionally, complex encoding schemes\n   like encoded-words introduce inefficiencies
    as well as significant\n   opportunities for processing errors.  And finally,
    native support for\n   the UTF-8 charset is now available on most systems.  Hence,
    it is\n   strongly desirable for Internet mail to support UTF-8 [RFC3629]\n   directly.\n
    \  This document specifies an enhancement to the Internet Message Format\n   [RFC5322]
    and to MIME that permits the direct use of UTF-8, rather\n   than only ASCII,
    in header field values, including mail addresses.  A\n   new media type, message/global,
    is defined for messages that use this\n   extended format.  This specification
    also lifts the MIME restriction\n   on having non-identity content-transfer-encodings
    on any subtype of\n   the message top-level type so that message/global parts
    can be safely\n   transmitted across existing mail infrastructure.\n   This specification
    is based on a model of native, end-to-end support\n   for UTF-8, which depends
    on having an \"8-bit-clean\" environment\n   assured by the transport system.
    \ Support for carriage across legacy,\n   7-bit infrastructure and for processing
    by 7-bit receivers requires\n   additional mechanisms that are not provided by
    these specifications.\n   This specification is a revision of and replacement
    for [RFC5335].\n   Section 6 of [RFC6530] describes the change in approach between
    this\n   specification and the previous version.\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Terminology Used in This Specification\n   A plain ASCII string is fully
    compatible with [RFC5321] and\n   [RFC5322].  In this document, non-ASCII strings
    are UTF-8 strings if\n   they are in header field values that contain at least
    one\n   <UTF8-non-ascii> (see Section 3.1).\n   Unless otherwise noted, all terms
    used here are defined in [RFC5321],\n   [RFC5322], [RFC6530], or [RFC6531].\n
    \  The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n
    \  \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n
    \  document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n   The term \"8-bit\"
    means octets are present in the data with values\n   above 0x7F.\n"
  title: 2.  Terminology Used in This Specification
- contents:
  - "3.  Changes to Message Header Fields\n   To permit non-ASCII Unicode characters
    in field values, the header\n   definition in [RFC5322] is extended to support
    the new format.  The\n   following sections specify the necessary changes to RFC
    5322's ABNF.\n   The syntax rules not mentioned below remain defined as in [RFC5322].\n
    \  Note that this protocol does not change rules in RFC 5322 for\n   defining
    header field names.  The bodies of header fields are allowed\n   to contain Unicode
    characters, but the header field names themselves\n   must consist of ASCII characters
    only.\n   Also note that messages in this format require the use of the\n   SMTPUTF8
    extension [RFC6531] to be transferred via SMTP.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  UTF-8 Syntax and Normalization\n   UTF-8 characters can be defined in
      terms of octets using the\n   following ABNF [RFC5234], taken from [RFC3629]:\n
      \  UTF8-non-ascii  =   UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4\n   UTF8-2          =   <Defined
      in Section 4 of RFC3629>\n   UTF8-3          =   <Defined in Section 4 of RFC3629>\n
      \  UTF8-4          =   <Defined in Section 4 of RFC3629>\n   See [RFC5198] for
      a discussion of Unicode normalization;\n   normalization form NFC [UNF] SHOULD
      be used.  Actually, if one is\n   going to do internationalization properly,
      one of the most often\n   cited goals is to permit people to spell their names
      correctly.\n   Since many mailbox local parts reflect personal names, that principle\n
      \  applies to mailboxes as well.  The NFKC normalization form [UNF]\n   SHOULD
      NOT be used because it may lose information that is needed to\n   correctly
      spell some names in some unusual circumstances.\n"
    title: 3.1.  UTF-8 Syntax and Normalization
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Syntax Extensions to RFC 5322\n   The following rules extend the ABNF
      syntax defined in [RFC5322] and\n   [RFC5234] in order to allow UTF-8 content.\n
      \  VCHAR   =/  UTF8-non-ascii\n   ctext   =/  UTF8-non-ascii\n   atext   =/
      \ UTF8-non-ascii\n   qtext   =/  UTF8-non-ascii\n   text    =/  UTF8-non-ascii\n
      \                ; note that this upgrades the body to UTF-8\n   dtext   =/
      \ UTF8-non-ascii\n   The preceding changes mean that the following constructs
      now allow\n   UTF-8:\n   1.  Unstructured text, used in header fields like \"Subject:\"
      or\n       \"Content-description:\".\n   2.  Any construct that uses atoms,
      including but not limited to the\n       local parts of addresses and Message-IDs.
      \ This includes\n       addresses in the \"for\" clauses of \"Received:\" header
      fields.\n   3.  Quoted strings.\n   4.  Domains.\n   Note that header field
      names are not on this list; these are still\n   restricted to ASCII.\n"
    title: 3.2.  Syntax Extensions to RFC 5322
  - contents:
    - "3.3.  Use of 8-bit UTF-8 in Message-IDs\n   Implementers of Message-ID generation
      algorithms MAY prefer to\n   restrain their output to ASCII since that has some
      advantages, such\n   as when constructing \"In-reply-to:\" and \"References:\"
      header fields\n   in mailing-list threads where some senders use internationalized\n
      \  addresses and others do not.\n"
    title: 3.3.  Use of 8-bit UTF-8 in Message-IDs
  - contents:
    - "3.4.  Effects on Line Length Limits\n   Section 2.1.1 of [RFC5322] limits lines
      to 998 characters and\n   recommends that the lines be restricted to only 78
      characters.  This\n   specification changes the former limit to 998 octets.
      \ (Note that, in\n   ASCII, octets and characters are effectively the same,
      but this is\n   not true in UTF-8.)  The 78-character limit remains defined
      in terms\n   of characters, not octets, since it is intended to address display\n
      \  width issues, not line-length issues.\n"
    title: 3.4.  Effects on Line Length Limits
  - contents:
    - "3.5.  Changes to MIME Message Type Encoding Restrictions\n   This specification
      updates Section 6.4 of [RFC2045].  [RFC2045]\n   prohibits applying a content-transfer-encoding
      to any subtypes of\n   \"message/\".  This specification relaxes that rule --
      it allows newly\n   defined MIME types to permit content-transfer-encoding,
      and it allows\n   content-transfer-encoding for message/global (see Section
      3.7).\n   Background: Normally, transfer of message/global will be done in\n
      \  8-bit-clean channels, and body parts will have \"identity\" encodings,\n
      \  that is, no decoding is necessary.\n   But in the case where a message containing
      a message/global is\n   downgraded from 8-bit to 7-bit as described in [RFC6152],
      an encoding\n   might have to be applied to the message.  If the message travels\n
      \  multiple times between a 7-bit environment and an environment\n   implementing
      these extensions, multiple levels of encoding may occur.\n   This is expected
      to be rarely seen in practice, and the potential\n   complexity of other ways
      of dealing with the issue is thought to be\n   larger than the complexity of
      allowing nested encodings where\n   necessary.\n"
    title: 3.5.  Changes to MIME Message Type Encoding Restrictions
  - contents:
    - "3.6.  Use of MIME Encoded-Words\n   The MIME encoded-words facility [RFC2047]
      provides the ability to\n   place non-ASCII text, but only in a subset of the
      places allowed by\n   this extension.  Additionally, encoded-words are substantially
      more\n   complex since they allow the use of arbitrary charsets.  Accordingly,\n
      \  encoded-words SHOULD NOT be used when generating header fields for\n   messages
      employing this extension.  Agents MAY, when incorporating\n   material from
      another message, convert encoded-word use to direct use\n   of UTF-8.\n   Note
      that care must be taken when decoding encoded-words because the\n   results
      after replacing an encoded-word with its decoded equivalent\n   in UTF-8 may
      be syntactically invalid.  Processors that elect to\n   decode encoded-words
      MUST NOT generate syntactically invalid fields.\n"
    title: 3.6.  Use of MIME Encoded-Words
  - contents:
    - "3.7.  The message/global Media Type\n   Internationalized messages in this
      format MUST only be transmitted as\n   authorized by [RFC6531] or within a non-SMTP
      environment that\n   supports these messages.  A message is a \"message/global
      message\" if:\n   o  it contains 8-bit UTF-8 header values as specified in this\n
      \     document, or\n   o  it contains 8-bit UTF-8 values in the header fields
      of body parts.\n   The content of a message/global part is otherwise identical
      to that\n   of a message/rfc822 part.\n   If an object of this type is sent
      to a 7-bit-only system, it MUST\n   have an appropriate content-transfer-encoding
      applied.  (Note that a\n   system compliant with MIME that doesn't recognize
      message/global is\n   supposed to treat it as \"application/octet-stream\" as
      described in\n   Section 5.2.4 of [RFC2046].)\n   The registration is as follows:\n
      \  Type name:  message\n   Subtype name:  global\n   Required parameters:  none\n
      \  Optional parameters:  none\n   Encoding considerations:  Any content-transfer-encoding
      is permitted.\n      The 8-bit or binary content-transfer-encodings are recommended\n
      \     where permitted.\n   Security considerations:  See Section 4.\n   Interoperability
      considerations:  This media type provides\n      functionality similar to the
      message/rfc822 content type for email\n      messages with internationalized
      email headers.  When there is a\n      need to embed or return such content
      in another message, there is\n      generally an option to use this media type
      and leave the content\n      unchanged or down-convert the content to message/rfc822.
      \ Each of\n      these choices will interoperate with the installed base, but
      with\n      different properties.  Systems unaware of internationalized\n      headers
      will typically treat a message/global body part as an\n      unknown attachment,
      while they will understand the structure of a\n      message/rfc822.  However,
      systems that understand message/global\n      will provide functionality superior
      to the result of a down-\n      conversion to message/rfc822.  The most interoperable
      choice\n      depends on the deployed software.\n   Published specification:
      \ RFC 6532\n   Applications that use this media type:  SMTP servers and email\n
      \     clients that support multipart/report generation or parsing.\n      Email
      clients that forward messages with internationalized headers\n      as attachments.\n
      \  Additional information:\n      Magic number(s):  none\n      File extension(s):
      \ The extension \".u8msg\" is suggested.\n      Macintosh file type code(s):
      \ A uniform type identifier (UTI) of\n         \"public.utf8-email-message\"
      is suggested.  This conforms to\n         \"public.message\" and \"public.composite-content\",
      but does not\n         necessarily conform to \"public.utf8-plain-text\".\n

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Because UTF-8 often requires several octets to
    encode a single\n   character, internationalization may cause header field values
    (in\n   general) and mail addresses (in particular) to become longer.  As\n   specified
    in [RFC5322], each line of characters MUST be no more than\n   998 octets, excluding
    the CRLF.  On the other hand, MDA (Mail\n   Delivery Agent) processes that parse,
    store, or handle email\n   addresses or local parts must take extra care not to
    overflow\n   buffers, truncate addresses, or exceed storage allotments.  Also,\n
    \  they must take care, when comparing, to use the entire lengths of the\n   addresses.\n
    \  There are lots of ways to use UTF-8 to represent something equivalent\n   or
    similar to a particular displayed character or group of\n   characters; see the
    security considerations in [RFC3629] for details\n   on the problems this can
    cause.  The normalization process described\n   in Section 3.1 is recommended
    to minimize these issues.\n   The security impact of UTF-8 headers on email signature
    systems such\n   as Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM), S/MIME, and OpenPGP is\n
    \  discussed in Section 14 of [RFC6530].\n   If a user has a non-ASCII mailbox
    address and an ASCII mailbox\n   address, a digital certificate that identifies
    that user might have\n   both addresses in the identity.  Having multiple email
    addresses as\n   identities in a single certificate is already supported in PKIX\n
    \  (Public Key Infrastructure using X.509) [RFC5280] and OpenPGP\n   [RFC3156],
    but there may be user-interface issues associated with the\n   introduction of
    UTF-8 into addresses in this context.\n"
