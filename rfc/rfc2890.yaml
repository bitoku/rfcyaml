  - "1. Introduction\n   The current specification of Generic Routing Encapsulation\
    \ [1]\n   specifies a protocol for encapsulation of an arbitrary protocol over\n\

    \ by which two fields, Key and Sequence Number, can be\n   optionally carried\

- title: 2.1. Key Field (4 octets)
  contents:
  - "2.1. Key Field (4 octets)\n   The Key field contains a four octet number which\
    \ was inserted by the\n   encapsulator. The actual method by which this Key is\
    \ obtained is\n   beyond the scope of the document. The Key field is intended\
    \ to be\n   used for identifying an individual traffic flow within a tunnel. For\n\
    \   example, packets may need to be routed based on context information\n   not\
    \ present in the encapsulated data.  The Key field provides this\n   context and\
    \ defines a logical traffic flow between encapsulator and\n   decapsulator.  Packets\
    \ belonging to a traffic flow are encapsulated\n   using the same Key value and\
    \ the decapsulating tunnel endpoint\n   identifies packets belonging to a traffic\
    \ flow based on the Key Field\n   value.\n"
- title: 2.2. Sequence Number (4 octets)
  contents:
  - "2.2. Sequence Number (4 octets)\n   The Sequence Number field is a four byte\
    \ field and is inserted by the\n   encapsulator when Sequence Number Present Bit\
    \ is set. The Sequence\n   Number MUST be used by the receiver to establish the\
    \ order in which\n   packets have been transmitted from the encapsulator to the\
    \ receiver.\n   The intended use of the Sequence Field is to provide unreliable\
    \ but\n   in-order delivery. If the Key present bit (bit 2) is set, the\n   sequence\
    \ number is specific to the traffic flow identified by the Key\n   field. Note\
    \ that packets without the sequence bit set can be\n   interleaved with packets\
    \ with the sequence bit set.\n   The sequence number value ranges from 0 to (2**32)-1.\
    \ The first\n   datagram is sent with a sequence number of 0. The sequence number\
    \ is\n   thus a free running counter represented modulo 2**32.  The receiver\n\
    \   maintains the sequence number value of the last successfully\n   decapsulated\
    \ packet. Upon establishment of the GRE tunnel, this value\n   should be set to\
    \ (2**32)-1.\n   When the decapsulator receives an out-of sequence packet it SHOULD\
    \ be\n   silently discarded. A packet is considered an out-of-sequence packet\n\
    \   if the sequence number of the received packet is less than or equal\n   to\
    \ the sequence number of last successfully decapsulated packet. The\n   sequence\
    \ number of a received message is considered less than or\n   equal to the last\
    \ successfully received sequence number if its value\n   lies in the range of\
    \ the last received sequence number and the\n   preceding 2**31-1 values, inclusive.\n\
    \   If the received packet is an in-sequence packet, it is successfully\n   decapsulated.\
    \ An in-sequence packet is one with a sequence number\n   exactly 1 greater than\
    \ (modulo 2**32) the last successfully\n   decapsulated packet, or one in which\
    \ the sequence number field is not\n   present (S bit not set).\n   If the received\
    \ packet is neither an in-sequence nor an out-of-\n   sequence packet it indicates\
    \ a sequence number gap. The receiver may\n   perform a small amount of buffering\
    \ in an attempt to recover the\n   original sequence of transmitted packets. In\
    \ this case, the packet\n   may be placed in a buffer sorted by sequence number.\
    \  If an in-\n   sequence packet is received and successfully decapsulated, the\n\
    \   receiver should consult the head of this buffer to see if the next\n   in-sequence\
    \ packet has already been received. If so, the receiver\n   should decapsulate\
    \ it as well as the following in-sequence packets\n   that may be present in the\
    \ buffer. The \"last successfully\n   decapsulated sequence number\" should then\
    \ be set to the last packet\n   that was decapsulated from the buffer.\n   Under\
    \ no circumstances should a packet wait more that\n   OUTOFORDER_TIMER milliseconds\
    \ in the buffer.  If a packet has been\n   waiting that long, the receiver MUST\
    \ immediately traverse the buffer\n   in sorted order, decapsulating packets (and\
    \ ignoring any sequence\n   number gaps) until there are no more packets in the\
    \ buffer that have\n   been waiting longer than OUTOFORDER_TIMER milliseconds.\
    \ The \"last\n   successfully decapsulated sequence number\" should then be set\
    \ to the\n   last packet so decapsulated.\n   The receiver may place a limit on\
    \ the number of packets in any per-\n   flow buffer (Packets with the same Key\
    \ Field value belong to a flow).\n   If a packet arrives that would cause the\
    \ receiver to place more than\n   MAX_PERFLOW_BUFFER packets into a given buffer,\
    \ then the packet at\n   the head of the buffer is immediately decapsulated regardless\
    \ of its\n   sequence number and the \"last successfully decapsulated sequence\n\
    \   number\" is set to its sequence number. The newly arrived packet may\n   then\
    \ be placed in the buffer.\n   Note that the sequence number is used to detect\
    \ lost packets and/or\n   restore the original sequence of packets (with buffering)\
    \ that may\n   have been reordered during transport.  Use of the sequence number\n\
    \   option should be used appropriately; in particular, it is a good idea\n  \
    \ a avoid using when tunneling protocols that have higher layer in-\n   order\
    \ delivery mechanisms or are tolerant to out-of-order delivery.\n   If only at\
    \ certain instances the protocol being carried in the GRE\n   tunnel requires\
    \ in-sequence delivery, only the corresponding packets\n   encapsulated in a GRE\
    \ header can be sent with the sequence bit set.\n   Reordering of out-of sequence\
    \ packets MAY be performed by the\n   decapsulator for improved performance and\
    \ tolerance to reordering in\n   the network.  A small amount of reordering buffer\n\
    \   (MAX_PERFLOW_BUFFER) may help in improving performance when the\n   higher\
    \ layer employs stateful compression or encryption. Since the\n   state of the\
    \ stateful compression or encryption is reset by packet\n   loss, it might help\
    \ the performance to tolerate some small amount of\n   packet reordering in the\
    \ network by buffering.\n"
- title: 3. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3. Security Considerations\n   This document describes extensions by which two\
    \ fields, Key and\n   Sequence Number, can be optionally carried in the GRE (Generic\n\
    \   Routing Encapsulation) Header [1].  When using the Sequence number\n   field,\
    \ it is possible to inject packets with an arbitrary Sequence\n   number and launch\
    \ a Denial of Service attack.  In order to protect\n   against such attacks, IP\
    \ security protocols [4] MUST be used to\n   protect the GRE header and the tunneled\
    \ payload.  Either ESP\n   (Encapsulating Security Payload) [5] or AH (Authentication\
    \ Header)[6]\n   MUST be used to protect the GRE header.  If ESP is used it protects\n\
    \   the IP payload which includes the GRE header. If AH is used the\n   entire\
    \ packet other than the mutable fields are authenticated. Note\n   that Key field\
    \ is not involved in any sort or security (despite its\n   name).\n"
