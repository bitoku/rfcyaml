Abstract This document defines new BGP Link State (BGP LS) TLVs in order to carry the IGP Traffic Engineering Metric Extensions defined in the IS IS and OSPF protocols.
Introduction BGP Link State (BGP LS)
[RFC7752] defines Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) and attributes in order to carry link state information.
New BGP LS Link Attribute TLVs are required in order to carry the Traffic Engineering Metric Extensions defined in [RFC8570] and [RFC7471].
Link Attribute TLVs for TE Metric Extensions
Unidirectional Utilized Bandwidth TLV formats are described in detail in the following subsections.
TLV formats follow the rules defined in [RFC7752].
This TLV advertises the average link delay between two directly connected IGP link state neighbors.
The semantics and values of the fields in the TLV are described in [RFC8570] and [RFC7471]. 0
Min/Max Unidirectional Link Delay TLV
This TLV advertises the minimum and maximum delay values between two directly connected IGP link state neighbors.
The semantics and values of the fields in the TLV are described in [RFC8570] and [RFC7471]. 0
where: Type:  1115 Length:  8 2.3.
This TLV advertises the average link delay variation between two directly connected IGP link state neighbors.
The semantics and values of the fields in the TLV are described in [RFC8570] and [RFC7471]. 0
where: Type:  1116 Length:  4 2.4.
This TLV advertises the loss (as a packet percentage) between two directly connected IGP link state neighbors.
The semantics and values of the fields in the TLV are described in [RFC8570] and [RFC7471]. 0
where: Type:  1117 Length:  4 2.5.
This TLV advertises the residual bandwidth between two directly connected IGP link state neighbors.
The semantics and values of the fields in the TLV are described in [RFC8570] and [RFC7471]. 0
where: Type:  1118 Length:  4 2.6.
This TLV advertises the available bandwidth between two directly connected IGP link state neighbors.
The semantics and values of the fields in the TLV are described in [RFC8570] and [RFC7471]. 0
where: Type:  1119 Length:  4 2.7.
This TLV advertises the bandwidth utilization between two directly connected IGP link state neighbors.
The semantics and values of the fields in the TLV are described in [RFC8570] and [RFC7471]. 0
where: Type:  1120 Length:  4 2.8.
Mappings to IGP Source Sub TLVs
This section documents the mappings between the Link Attribute TLVs defined in this document and the corresponding advertisements sourced by the IGPs.
For OSPFv2 and OSPFv3, the advertisements are defined in [RFC7471].
For IS IS, the advertisements are defined in [RFC8570].
Security Considerations Procedures and protocol extensions defined in this document do not affect the BGP security model.
See the "Security Considerations" section of [RFC4271] for a discussion of BGP security.
Also, refer to [RFC4272] and [RFC6952] for analyses of security issues for BGP.
Security considerations for acquiring and distributing BGP LS information are discussed in [RFC7752].
The TLVs introduced in this document are used to propagate the Traffic Engineering Metric Extensions defined in [RFC8570] and [RFC7471].
These TLVs represent the state and resource availability of the IGP link.
It is assumed that the IGP instances originating these TLVs will support all the required security and authentication mechanisms (as described in [RFC8570] and [RFC7471]) in order to prevent any security issues when propagating the TLVs into BGP LS.
The advertisement of the link attribute information defined in this document presents no additional risk beyond that associated with the existing link attribute information already supported in [RFC7752].
