  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) suite\
    \ of\n   protocols allows for the automated control of different switching\n \
    \  technologies, including the Synchronous Optical Network (SONET),\n   Synchronous\
    \ Digital Hierarchy (SDH), Optical Transport Network (OTN),\n   and Plesiochronous\
    \ Digital Hierarchy (PDH).  This document updates\n   the procedures described\
    \ in [RFC4606] to allow supporting additional\n   applications of the Virtual\
    \ Concatenation (VCAT) layer 1 inverse\n   multiplexing mechanism that has been\
    \ standardized for SONET, SDH,\n   OTN, and PDH [ANSI-T1.105] [ITU-T-G.707] [ITU-T-G.709]\
    \ [ITU-T-G.7043]\n   technologies, along with its companion Link Capacity Adjustment\n\
    \   Scheme (LCAS) [ITU-T-G.7042].\n   VCAT is a time-division multiplexing (TDM)-oriented\
    \ byte striping\n   inverse multiplexing method that works with a wide range of\
    \ existing\n   and emerging TDM framed signals, including very-high-bit-rate OTN\
    \ and\n   SDH/SONET signals.  VCAT enables the selection of an optimal signal\n\
    \   server bandwidth (size) utilizing a group of server signals and\n   provides\
    \ for efficient use of bandwidth in a mesh network.  When\n   combined with LCAS,\
    \ hitless dynamic resizing of bandwidth and fast\n   graceful degradation in the\
    \ presence of network faults can be\n   supported.  To take full advantage of\
    \ VCAT/LCAS functionality,\n   additional extensions to GMPLS signaling are needed\
    \ that enable the\n   setup of diversely routed signals that are members of the\
    \ same VCAT\n   group.  Note that the scope of this document is limited to scenarios\n\
    \   where all member signals of a VCAT group are controlled using\n   mechanisms\
    \ defined in this document and related RFCs.  Scenarios\n   where a subset of\
    \ member signals are controlled by a management plane\n   or a proprietary control\
    \ plane are outside the scope of this\n   document.\n"

    \   that are neither VCAT-capable nor LCAS-capable.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Member Signal Configuration Scenarios
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Member Signal Configuration Scenarios\n   We list in this section the different\
    \ scenarios.  Here we use the\n   [ITU-T-G.707] term \"VCG\" to refer to the VCAT\
    \ group and the\n   terminology \"set\" and \"subset\" to refer to the subdivision\
    \ of the\n   group and the individual VCAT group member signals.  As noted above,\n\
    \   the scope of these scenarios is limited to scenarios where all member\n  \
    \ signals are controlled using mechanisms defined in this document.\n   The scenarios\
    \ listed here are dependent on the terms \"co-routed\" and\n   \"diversely routed\"\
    .  In the context of this document, \"co-routed\"\n   refers to a set of VCAT\
    \ signals that all traverse the same sequence\n   of switching nodes.  Furthermore,\
    \ a co-routed set of signals between\n   any pair of adjacent nodes utilizes a\
    \ set of links that have similar\n   delay characteristics.  Thus, \"diversely\
    \ routed\" means a set of\n   signals that are not classed as \"co-routed\".\n\
    \   Fixed, co-routed: A fixed-bandwidth VCG, transported over a co-routed\n  \
    \    set of member signals.  This is the case where the intended\n      bandwidth\
    \ of the VCG does not change and all member signals follow\n      the same route\
    \ to minimize differential delay.  The application\n      here is the capability\
    \ to allocate an amount of bandwidth close to\n      that required at the client\
    \ layer.\n   Fixed, diversely routed: A fixed-bandwidth VCG, transported over\
    \ at\n      least two diversely routed subsets of member signals.  In this\n \
    \     case, the subsets are link-disjoint over at least one link of the\n    \
    \  route.  The application here is more efficient use of network\n      resources,\
    \ e.g., no unique route has the required bandwidth.\n   Fixed, member sharing:\
    \ A fixed-bandwidth VCG, transported over a set\n      of member signals that\
    \ are allocated from a common pool of\n      available member signals without\
    \ requiring member connection\n      teardown and setup.  This document only covers\
    \ the case where this\n      pool of \"potential\" member signals has been established\
    \ via\n      mechanisms defined in this document.  Member signals need not be\n\
    \      co-routed or be guaranteed to be diversely routed.  Note that by\n    \
    \  the nature of VCAT, a member signal can only belong to one VCG at\n      a\
    \ time.  To be used in a different VCG, a signal must first be\n      removed\
    \ from any VCG to which it may belong.\n   Dynamic, co-routed: A dynamic VCG (bandwidth\
    \ can be increased or\n      decreased via the addition or removal of member signals),\n\
    \      transported over a co-routed set of members.  The application here\n  \
    \    is dynamic resizing and resilience of bandwidth.\n   Dynamic, diversely routed:\
    \ A dynamic VCG (bandwidth can be increased\n      or decreased via the addition\
    \ or removal of member signals),\n      transported over at least two diversely\
    \ routed subsets of member\n      signals.  The application here is efficient\
    \ use of network\n      resources, dynamic resizing, and resilience of bandwidth.\n\
    \   Dynamic, member sharing: A dynamic-bandwidth VCG, transported over a\n   \
    \   set of member signals that are allocated from a common pool of\n      available\
    \ member signals without requiring member connection\n      teardown and setup.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.3.  VCAT Operation with or without LCAS\n   VCAT capabilities may be present\
    \ with or without the presence of\n   LCAS.  The use of LCAS is beneficial in\
    \ the provisioning of flexible\n   bandwidth services, but in the absence of LCAS,\
    \ VCAT is still a valid\n   technique.  Therefore, GMPLS mechanisms for the operation\
    \ of VCAT are\n   REQUIRED for both the case where LCAS is available and the case\
    \ where\n   it is not available.  The GMPLS procedures for the two cases SHOULD\n\
    \   be identical.\n   o  GMPLS signaling for LCAS-capable interfaces MUST support\
    \ all\n      scenarios described in Section 2.2 with no loss of traffic.\n   o\
    \  GMPLS signaling for non-LCAS-capable interfaces MUST support the\n      \"\
    fixed\" scenarios described in Section 2.2.\n   To provide for these requirements,\
    \ GMPLS signaling MUST carry the\n   following information on behalf of the VCAT\
    \ endpoints:\n   o  The type of the member signal that the VCG will contain, e.g.,\n\
    \      VC-3, VC-4, etc.\n   o  The total number of members to be in the VCG. \
    \ This provides the\n      endpoints in both the LCAS and non-LCAS case with information\
    \ on\n      which to accept or reject the request, and in the non-LCAS case\n\

    \  have been established.\n   o  Identification of the VCG and its associated\

    \ to associate with a particular VCG.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.4.  VCGs and VCG Members\n   The signaling solution SHOULD provide a mechanism\

    \   However, it is not required that any arbitrarily created server-layer\n  \

  - "4.  VCGs Composed of a Single Member Set (One LSP)\n   In this section and the\
    \ next section, we will describe the procedures\n   for supporting the applications\
    \ described in Section 2.\n   This section describes the support of a single VCG\
    \ composed of a\n   single member set (in support of the fixed, co-routed application\
    \ and\n   the dynamic, co-routed application) using existing GMPLS procedures\n\
    \   [RFC4606].  Note that this section is included for informational\n   purposes\

- title: 4.2.  Incremental VCG Setup
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Incremental VCG Setup\n   In some cases, it may be necessary or desirable\
    \ to set up the VCG\n   members individually, or to add group members to an existing\
    \ group.\n   One example of this need is when the local policy requires that VCAT\n\
    \   can only add VCAT members one at a time or cannot automatically match\n  \
    \ the members at the ingress and egress for the purposes of inverse\n   multiplexing.\
    \  Serial or incremental setup solves this problem.\n   In order to accomplish\
    \ incremental setup, an iterative process is\n   used to add group members.  For\
    \ each iteration, NVC is incremented up\n   to the final value required.  A successful\
    \ iteration consists of the\n   successful completion of Path and Resv signaling.\
    \  At first, NVC = 1,\n   and the label includes just one timeslot identifier.\n\
    \   At each of the next iterations, NVC is set to (NVC + 1), and one more\n  \
    \ timeslot identifier is added to the ordered list in the Generalized\n   Label\
    \ (in the Path or Resv message).  A node that receives a Path\n   message that\
    \ contains changed fields will process the full Path\n   message and, based on\
    \ the new value of NVC, it will add a component\n   signal to the VCAT group,\
    \ and switch the new timeslot based on the\n   new label information.\n   Following\
    \ the addition of the new label (identifying the new member)\n   to the LSP, in\
    \ the data plane, LCAS may be used to add the new member\n   at the endpoints\
    \ into the existing VCAT group.  LCAS (data plane)\n   signaling is described\
    \ in [ITU-T-G.7042].\n"
- title: 4.3.  Procedure for VCG Reduction by Removing a Member
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Procedure for VCG Reduction by Removing a Member\n   The procedure to remove\
    \ a component signal is similar to that used to\n   add components as described\
    \ in Section 4.2.  In the data plane, LCAS\n   signaling is used first to take\
    \ the component out of service from the\n   group.  LCAS signaling is described\
    \ in [ITU-T-G.7042].\n   In this case, the NVC value is decremented by 1, and\
    \ the timeslot\n   identifier for the dropped component is removed from the ordered\
    \ list\n   in the Generalized Label.\n   Note that for interfaces that are not\
    \ LCAS-capable, removing one\n   component of the VCG will result in failure detection\
    \ of the member\n   at the endpoint and failure of the whole group.  So, this\
    \ is a\n   feature that only LCAS-capable VCAT interfaces can support without\n\
    \   management intervention at the endpoints.\n   Note that if using LCAS, a VCG\
    \ member can be temporarily removed from\n   the VCG due to a failure of the component\

- title: 5.  VCGs Composed of Multiple Member Sets (Multiple LSPs)
  contents:
  - "5.  VCGs Composed of Multiple Member Sets (Multiple LSPs)\n   The motivation\
    \ for VCGs composed of multiple member sets comes from\n   the requirement to\
    \ support VCGs with diversely routed members.  The\n   initial GMPLS specification\
    \ did not support diversely routed signals\n   using the NVC construct.  [RFC4606]\
    \ says:\n      [...] The standard definition for virtual concatenation allows\n\
    \      each virtual concatenation component to travel over diverse paths.\n  \
    \    Within GMPLS, virtual concatenation components must travel over\n      the\
    \ same (component) link if they are part of the same LSP.  This\n      is due\
    \ to the way that labels are bound to a (component) link.\n      Note, however,\
    \ that the routing of components on different paths\n      is indeed equivalent\
    \ to establishing different LSPs, each one\n      having its own route.  Several\
    \ LSPs can be initiated and\n      terminated between the same nodes, and their\
    \ corresponding\n      components can then be associated together (i.e., virtually\n\
    \      concatenated).\n   The setup of diversely routed VCG members requires multiple\
    \ VCG\n   member sets, i.e., multiple control plane LSPs.\n   The support of a\
    \ VCG with multiple VCG member sets requires being\n   able to identify separate\
    \ sets of control plane LSPs with a single\n   VCG and exchange information pertaining\
    \ to the VCG as a whole between\n   the endpoints.  This document updates the\
    \ procedures described in\n   [RFC4606] to provide this capability by using the\
    \ call procedures and\n   extensions described in [RFC4974].  The VCG makes use\
    \ of one or more\n   calls (VCAT calls) to associate control plane LSPs in support\
    \ of VCG\n   server-layer connections (VCG members) in the data plane.  Note that\n\
    \   the trigger for the VCG (by management plane or client layer) is\n   outside\
    \ the scope of this document.  These procedures provide for\n   autonomy of the\
    \ client layer and server layer with respect to their\n   management.\n   In addition,\
    \ by supporting the identification of a VCG (VCG ID) and\n   VCAT call identification\
    \ (VCAT Call ID), support can be provided for\n   the member-sharing scenarios,\
    \ i.e., by explicitly separating the VCG\n   ID from the VCAT call ID.  Note that\
    \ per [RFC4974], LSPs\n   (connections) cannot be moved from one call to another;\
    \ hence, to\n   support member sharing, the procedures in this document provide\n\
    \   support by moving call(s) and their associated LSPs from one VCG to\n   another.\
    \  Figure 1 below illustrates these relationships; however,\n   note that VCAT\
    \ calls can exist independently of a VCG (for connection\n   pre-establishment),\
    \ as will be described later in this document.\n    +-------+      +-------------+\

  contents:

    \ case of a decrease, removed from a\n      VCAT call already associated with\
    \ a VCG.\n   2. An existing VCAT call (and corresponding LSPs) is associated with\n\
    \      a VCG or, in the case of a decrease, has its association removed.\n   \
    \   Note that in the case of an increase, the call MUST NOT have any\n      existing\
    \ association with a VCG.\n   The following sequence SHOULD be used when modifying\
    \ the bandwidth of\n   a VCG:\n   1. In both cases, prior to any other change,\
    \ a Notify message MUST be\n      sent with a CALL_ATTRIBUTES object containing\
    \ a VCAT TLV for each\n      of the existing VCAT calls associated with the VCG.\
    \  The Action\n      field of the TLV MUST be set to 2.  The VCG ID field MUST\
    \ be set\n      to match the VCG.  The Number of Members field MUST equal the\
    \ sum\n      of all LSPs that are anticipated to be associated with the VCG\n\
    \      after the bandwidth change.  The Notify message is otherwise\n      formatted\
    \ and processed to support call establishment as described\n      in [RFC4974].\
    \  If an error is encountered while processing any of\n      the Notify messages,\
    \ the number of members is reverted to the\n      pre-change value, and the increase\
    \ is aborted.  The reverted\n      number of members MUST be signaled in a Notify\
    \ message as\n      described above.  Failures encountered in processing these\
    \ Notify\n      messages are handled per [RFC4974].\n   2. Once the existing calls\
    \ have successfully been notified of the new\n      number of members in the VCG,\
    \ the bandwidth change can be made.\n      The next step is dependent on the two\
    \ cases defined above.  In the\n      first case defined above, the bandwidth\
    \ change is made by adding\n      (in the case of an increase) or removing (in\
    \ the case of a\n      decrease) LSPs to or from the VCAT call per the procedures\
    \ defined\n      in [RFC4974].  In the second case, the procedure defined in\n\
