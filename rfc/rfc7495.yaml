  title: __initial_text__
- contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) is an XML\n
    \  data representation framework for sharing information about computer\n   security
    incidents.  In IODEF, the Reference class provides\n   references to externally
    specified information such as a\n   vulnerability, Intrusion Detection System
    (IDS) alert, malware\n   sample, advisory, or attack technique.  In practice,
    these references\n   are based on external enumeration specifications that define
    both the\n   enumeration format and the specific enumeration values, but the IODEF\n
    \  Reference class (as specified in IODEF v1 in RFC 5070) does not\n   indicate
    how to include both of these important pieces of\n   information.\n   This document
    establishes a stand-alone data format to include both\n   the external specification
    and specific enumeration identification\n   value, and establishes an IANA registry
    to manage external\n   enumeration specifications.  While this document does not
    update\n   IODEF v1, this enumeration reference format is used in IODEF v2 and\n
    \  is applicable to other formats that support this class of enumeration\n   references.\n"

  - "2.  Referencing External Enumerations\n   The need is to place enumeration identifiers
    and their enumeration\n   format references in IODEF's Reference class.  There
    are several ways\n   to accomplish this goal, but the most appropriate at this
    point is to\n   require a specific structure for the ReferenceName string of the\n
    \  IODEF Reference class, and use an IANA registry to manage references\n   to
    specific enumeration reference formats.\n   Per IODEF [IODEF], the ReferenceName
    is of type ML_STRING.  This\n   becomes problematic when specific references,
    especially enumeration\n   formats such as Common Vulnerability Enumeration [CVE],
    Common\n   Configuration Enumeration [CCE], Common Platform Enumeration [CPE],\n
    \  and so on, are referenced -- how is an implementer to know which type\n   of
    reference this is, and thus how to parse it?  One solution,\n   presented here,
    is to require that ReferenceName follow a particular\n   format.\n   Inclusion
    of such enumeration values, especially those related to\n   security automation,
    is important to incident communication and\n   investigation.  Typically, an enumeration
    identifier is simply an\n   identifier with a specific format as defined by an
    external party.\n   Further, that enumeration identifier is itself a reference
    to\n   specific information associated with the identifier.  Thus, the\n   ReferenceName
    is an identifier that is formatted in a specific manner\n   and that identifies
    some set of associated information.\n   For example, a vulnerability identifier
    following the CVE [CVE]\n   formatting specification may be CVE-2014-0001.  That
    identifier is\n   formatted in a specific manner and relates to information about
    a\n   specific vulnerability.  Communicating the format for the identifier\n   is
    the subject of this document.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Reference Name Format\n   The ReferenceName class provides the XML representation
      for\n   identifying an enumeration and specifying a value from it.  A given\n
      \  enumeration is uniquely identified by the specIndex attribute.  Each\n   specIndex
      value corresponds to an entry in the \"Enumeration Reference\n   Type Identifiers\"
      IANA registry (see Section 4).  The child ID\n   element represents a particular
      value from the corresponding\n   enumeration identified by the specIndex attribute.
      \ The format of the\n   ID element is described in the IANA registry entry of
      the\n   enumeration.\n         +-------------------------+\n         | ReferenceName
      \          |\n         +-------------------------+\n         | INTEGER specIndex
      \      |<>----------[ ID    ]\n         +-------------------------+\n                      Figure
      1: The ReferenceName Class\n   The aggregate class that constitutes ReferenceName
      is:\n      ID\n         One.  The identifier assigned to represent the particular\n
      \        enumeration object being referenced.\n   The ReferenceName class has
      one attribute.\n      specIndex\n         Required.  INTEGER.  Enumeration identifier.
      \ This value\n         corresponds to an entry in the \"Enumeration Reference
      Type\n         Identifiers\" IANA registry with an identical SpecIndex value.\n
      \  An example of such a reference is as follows:\n      <iodef:Reference>\n
      \        <enum:ReferenceName specIndex=\"1\">\n            <enum:ID>CXI-1234-XYZ</enum:ID>\n
      \        </enum:ReferenceName>\n         <iodef:URL>http://cxi.example.com</iodef:URL>\n
      \        <iodef:Description>Foo</iodef:Description>\n      </iodef:Reference>\n
      \  Information in the IANA table (see Section 4) would include:\n      Full
      Name: Concept X Identifier\n      SpecIndex: 1\n      Version: any\n      Specification
      URI: http://cxi.example.com/spec_url\n"

    - "2.2.  Reference Method Applicability\n   While the scope of this document pertains
      to IODEF, any standard\n   needing to reference an enumeration identified by
      a specially\n   formatted string can use this method of providing structure
      after the\n   standard has been published.  In effect, this method provides
      a\n   standardized interface for enumeration formats, thus allowing a loose\n
      \  coupling between a given standard and the enumeration identifiers it\n   needs
      to reference now and in the future.\n"

  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   Ensuring a proper mapping of enumeration reference
    ID elements to the\n   correct SpecIndex is important.  Potential consequences
    of not\n   mapping correctly include inaccurate information in references and\n
    \  similar distribution of misinformation.\n   Use of enumeration reference IDs
    from trusted sources is preferred to\n   mitigate the risk of receiving and/or
    providing misinformation.\n   Trust decisions with respect to enumeration reference
    providers are\n   beyond the scope of this document.  However, receiving an IODEF\n
    \  [IODEF] document containing an unknown ReferenceName (i.e., the\n   SpecIndex
    does not exist in the IANA table) may indicate a misled or\n   malicious source.\n
    \  This document establishes a container for publicly available\n   enumeration
    values to be included in an IODEF [IODEF] document, and\n   it is important to
    note the distinction between the enumeration\n   value's format and the information
    conveyed by the value itself.\n   While the enumeration value may hold information
    deemed to be private\n   by relying parties, the enumeration format is likely
    not subject to\n   privacy concerns.\n   However, if the Reference class includes
    an enumeration value in\n   combination with other data in an IODEF [IODEF] document,
    the\n   resulting combination could expose information.  An example might\n   include
    attack vectors or system descriptions used in a privacy-\n   related incident.
    \ As such, the reader is referred to the IODEF\n   [IODEF] Security Considerations
    section, which explicitly covers\n   protecting IODEF [IODEF] documents in transit
    and at rest, ensuring\n   proper recipient authentication, data confidence levels,
    underlying\n   transport security characteristics, and proper use of IODEF's\n
    \  restriction attribute.\n"

  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   This document specifies an enumeration reference
    identifier format.\n   All fields, including abbreviation, are mandatory.\n   Per
    this document, IANA has created and maintains the following\n   registry:\n      Name
    of the Registry: \"Security External Enumeration Registry\"\n      Location of
    Registry: http://www.iana.org/assignments/sec-ext-enum\n      Fields to record
    in the registry:\n         Full Name: The full name of the enumeration (i.e.,
    the\n         referenced specification) as a string from the printable ASCII\n
    \        character set [RFC20] with individual embedded spaces allowed.\n         The
    ABNF [RFC5234] syntax for this field is:\n               FULL-NAME = 1*VCHAR *(SP
    1*VCHAR)\n         Abbreviation: An abbreviation may be an acronym -- it consists\n
    \        of uppercase characters (at least two).  Uppercase is used to\n         avoid
    mismatches due to case differences.  It is specified by\n         this ABNF [RFC5234]
    syntax:\n               ABBREVIATION = 2*UC-ALPHA      ; At least two\n               UC-ALPHA
    = %x41-5A             ; A-Z\n               Multiple registrations MAY use the
    same Abbreviation but\n               MUST have different Versions.\n         SpecIndex:
    This is an IANA-assigned positive integer that\n         identifies the registration.
    \ The first entry added to this\n         registry uses the value 1, and this
    value is incremented for\n         each subsequent entry added to the registry.\n
    \        Version: The version of the enumeration (i.e., the referenced\n         specification)
    as a free-form string from the printable ASCII\n         character set [RFC20]
    excepting white space, i.e., from VCHAR\n         as defined in [RFC5234].  Some
    of the characters allowed in the\n         version string are escaped when that
    string is used in XML\n         documents (e.g., '<' is represented as &lt;);
    the registered\n         version string contains the unescaped ASCII character
    in all\n         such cases.\n         Specification URI/Reference: A list of
    one or more URIs\n         [RFC3986] from which the registered specification can
    be\n         obtained.  The registered specification MUST be readily and\n         publicly
    available from that URI.  The URI SHOULD be a stable\n         reference to a
    specific version of the specification.  URIs\n         that designate the latest
    version of a specification (which\n         changes when a new version appears)
    SHOULD NOT be used.\n      Initial registry contents:\n         Full Name: Common
    Vulnerabilities and Exposures\n         Abbreviation: CVE\n         SpecIndex:
    1\n         Version: 1.0\n         Specification URI/Reference:\n         https://nvd.nist.gov/download.cfm#CVE_FEED\n
    \     Allocation Policy: Specification Required [RFC5226] (which implies\n      Expert
    Review [RFC5226]).\n   The Designated Expert is expected to consult with the MILE
    (Managed\n   Incident Lightweight Exchange) working group or its successor if
    any\n   such WG exists (e.g., via email to the working group's mailing list).\n
    \  The Designated Expert is expected to review the request and validate\n   the
    appropriateness of the enumeration for the attribute.  This\n   review includes
    review of the specification associated with the\n   request.\n   The Designated
    Expert is expected to ensure that the Full Name,\n   Abbreviation, and Version
    are appropriate and that the information at\n   the Specification URI is sufficient
    to unambiguously parse\n   identifiers based on that specification.  Additionally,
    the\n   Designated Expert should prefer short Abbreviations over long ones.\n
