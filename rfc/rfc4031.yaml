  - "Abstract\n   This document provides requirements for Layer 3 Virtual Private\n\
    \   Networks (L3VPNs).  It identifies requirements applicable to a number\n  \
    \ of individual approaches that a Service Provider may use to provision\n   a\
    \ Virtual Private Network (VPN) service.  This document expresses a\n   service\
    \ provider perspective, based upon past experience with IP-\n   based service\
    \ offerings and the ever-evolving needs of the customers\n   of such services.\
    \  Toward this end, it first defines terminology and\n   states general requirements.\
    \  Detailed requirements are expressed\n   from a customer perspective as well\
    \ as that of a service provider.\n"

- title: 1.1.  Scope of This Document
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Scope of This Document\n   This document provides requirements specific\
    \ to Layer 3 Virtual\n   Private Networks (L3VPN). (Requirements that are generic\
    \ to L2 and L3\n   VPNs are contained in [RFC3809].)\n   This document identifies\
    \ requirements that may apply to one or more\n   individual approaches that a\
    \ Service Provider may use to provision a\n   Layer 3 (e.g., IP) VPN service.\
    \  It makes use of the terminology and\n   common components for Layer 3 VPNs\
    \ as defined in [L3VPN-FR] and of\n   the generic VPN terminology defined in\n\
    \   [PPVPN-TERM].\n   The specification of technical means to provide L3VPN services\
    \ is\n   outside the scope of this document.  Other documents are intended to\n\
    \   cover this aspect, such as the L3 VPN framework document [L3VPN-FR]\n   and\
    \ several sets of documents, one for each technical approach for\n   providing\
    \ L3VPN services.\n   Technical approaches targeted by this document include the\
    \ network-\n   based (PE-based) L3VPN category (aggregated routing VPNs [2547bis]\n\
    \   and virtual routers [PPVPN-VR]) and the CE-based L3VPNs category\n   [CE-PPVPN][IPSEC-PPVPN].\
    \  The document distinguishes L3VPN categories\n   as to where the endpoints of\
    \ tunnels exist, as detailed in the L3VPN\n   framework document [L3VPN-FR]. \
    \ Terminology describing whether\n   equipment faces a customer or the service\
    \ provider network is used to\n   define the various types of L3VPN solutions.\n\
    \   This document is intended as a \"checklist\" of requirements, providing\n\
    \   a consistent way to evaluate and document how well each approach\n   satisfies\
    \ specific requirements.  The applicability statement\n   documents for each approach\
    \ should present the results of this\n   evaluation.  This document is not intended\
    \ to compare one approach to\n   another.\n   This document provides requirements\
    \ from several points of view.  It\n   begins with some considerations from a\
    \ point of view common to\n   customers and service providers not covered in the\
    \ generic provider\n   provisioned VPN requirement document [RFC3809], continues\
    \ with a\n   customer perspective, and concludes with specific needs of a Service\n\
    \   Provider (SP).\n   The following L3VPN deployment scenarios are considered\
    \ within this\n   document:\n   1.  Internet-wide: VPN sites attached to arbitrary\
    \ points in the\n       Internet.\n   2.  Single SP/single AS: VPN sites attached\
    \ to the network of a\n       single provider within the scope of a single AS.\n\
    \   3.  Single SP/multiple ASes: VPN sites attached to the network of a\n    \
    \   single provider consisting of multiple ASes.\n   4.  Cooperating SPs: VPN\
    \ sites attached to networks of different\n       providers that cooperate with\
    \ each other to provide the VPN\n       service.\n   The above deployment scenarios\
    \ have many requirements in common.\n   These include SP requirements for security,\
    \ privacy, manageability,\n   interoperability, and scalability, including service\
    \ provider\n   projections for number, complexity, and rate of change of customer\n\
    \   VPNs over the next several years.  When requirements apply to a\n   specific\
    \ deployment scenario, the above terminology is used to state\n   the context\
    \ of those particular requirements.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Virtual Private Network
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Virtual Private Network\n   \"L3 Virtual Private Network\" (L3VPN) refers\
    \ to the L3 communication\n   between a set of sites making use of a shared network\
    \ infrastructure.\n   \"Provider Provisioned VPN\" (PPVPN) refers to VPNs for\
    \ which the\n   service provider participates in management and provisioning of\
    \ the\n   VPN.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Users, Sites, Customers, and Agents
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Users, Sites, Customers, and Agents\n   User: A user is an entity (e.g.,\
    \ a human being using a host, a\n   server, or a system) authorized to use a VPN\
    \ service.\n   Site: A site is a set of users that have mutual L3 (i.e., IP)\n\
    \   reachability without use of a specific service provider network.  A\n   site\
    \ may consist of a set of users that are in geographic proximity.\n   Note that\
    \ a topological definition of a site (e.g., all users at a\n   specific geographic\
    \ location) may not always conform to this\n   definition.  For example, two geographic\
    \ locations connected via\n   another provider's network would also constitute\
    \ a single site as\n   communication between the two locations does not involve\
    \ the use of\n   the service provider offering the L3 VPN service.\n   Customer:\
    \ A single organization, corporation, or enterprise that\n   administratively\
    \ controls a set of sites.\n   Agent: A set of users designated by a customer\
    \ who has the\n   authorization to manage a customer's VPN service offering.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Intranets, Extranets, and VPNs
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Intranets, Extranets, and VPNs\n   Intranet: An intranet restricts communication\
    \ to a set of sites that\n   belong to one customer.  An example is branch offices\
    \ at different\n   sites that require communication with a headquarters site.\n\
    \   Extranet: An extranet allows the specification of communication\n   between\
    \ a set of sites that belong to different customers.  In other\n   words, two\
    \ or more organizations have access to a specified set of\n   each other's sites.\
    \  Examples of extranets include multiple companies\n   cooperating in joint software\
    \ development, a service provider having\n   access to information from the vendors'\
    \ corporate sites, different\n   companies, or universities participating in a\
    \ consortium.  An\n   extranet often has further restrictions on reachability,\
    \ for example,\n   at a host and individual transport level.\n   Note that an\
    \ intranet or extranet can exist across a single service\n   provider network\
    \ with one or more ASes, or across multiple service\n   provider networks.\n \
    \  L3 Virtual Private Network (L3VPN): An alternative definition of VPN\n   refers\
    \ to a specific set of sites that have been configured to allow\n   communication\
    \ as either an intranet or an extranet.  Note that a site\n   is a member of at\
    \ least one VPN and may be a member of many VPNs.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Networks of Customer and Provider Devices
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Networks of Customer and Provider Devices\n   L3VPNs are composed of the\
    \ following types of devices.\n   Customer Edge (CE) device: A CE device faces\
    \ the users at a customer\n   site.  The CE has an access connection to a PE device.\
    \  It may be a\n   router or a switch that allows users at a customer site to\n\
    \   communicate over the access network with other sites in the VPN.  In\n   a\
    \ CE-based L3VPN, as intended in this document (provider-provisioned\n   CE-based\
    \ VPN), the service provider manages (at least partially) the\n   CE device.\n\
    \   Provider Edge (PE) device: A PE device faces the provider network on\n   one\
    \ side and attaches via an access connection over one or more\n   access networks\
    \ to one or more CE devices.  It participates in the\n   Packet Switched Network\
    \ (PSN) in performing routing and forwarding\n   functions.\n   Note that the\
    \ definitions of Customer Edge and Provider Edge do not\n   necessarily describe\
    \ the physical deployment of equipment on customer\n   premises or a provider\
    \ point of presence.\n   Provider (P) device: A device within a provider network\
    \ that\n   interconnects PE (or other P) devices but does not have any direct\n\
    \   attachment to CE devices.  The P router does not keep VPN state and\n   is\
    \ VPN unaware [PPVPN-TERM].\n   Packet Switched Network (PSN): A (IP or MPLS [RFC3031])\

  contents:
  - "3.6.1.  PE-Based L3VPNs and Virtual Forwarding Instances\n   In a PE-based L3VPN\
    \ service, a customer site receives IP layer (i.e.,\n   layer 3) service from\
    \ the SP.  The PE is attached via an access\n   connection to one or more CEs.\
    \  The PE forwards user data packets\n   based on information in the IP layer\
    \ header, such as an IPv4 or IPv6\n   destination address.  The CE sees the PE\
    \ as a layer 3 device such as\n   an IPv4 or IPv6 router.\n   Virtual Forwarding\
    \ Instance (VFI): In a PE-based L3VPN service, the\n   PE contains a VFI for each\
    \ L3 VPN that it serves.  The VFI terminates\n   tunnels for interconnection with\
    \ other VFIs and also terminates\n   access connections for accommodating CEs.\
    \  VFI contains information\n   regarding how to forward data received over the\
    \ CE-PE access\n   connection to VFIs in other PEs supporting the same L3VPN.\
    \  The VFI\n   includes the router information base and the forwarding information\n\
    \   base for an L3VPN [L3VPN-FR].  A VFI enables router functions\n   dedicated\
    \ to serving a particular VPN, such as separation of\n   forwarding and routing\
    \ and support for overlapping address spaces.\n   Routing protocols in the PEs\
    \ and the CEs interact to populate the\n   VFI.\n   The following narrative and\
    \ figures provide further explanation of\n   the way PE devices use tunnels and\
    \ hierarchical tunnels.  Figure 1.1\n   illustrates the case where a PE uses a\

    \ that customers may select or\n   may offer custom profiles based on customer\
    \ specific requirements.\n   In general, more complex QoS policies should be left\

    \ backbones.\n   The CE requirements for this service model are the same as the\n\

    \ a subset) of\n          other sites in the VPN (i.e., the cloud), as applicable.\
    \  In\n          other words, a point-to-cloud SLS defines compliance in terms\n\
    \          of all packets transmitted from a given VPN site toward the SP\n  \
    \        network on an aggregate basis (i.e., regardless of the\n          destination\

    \ a customer\n   perspective.\n"
- title: 5.1.  VPN Membership (Intranet/Extranet)
  contents:
  - "5.1.  VPN Membership (Intranet/Extranet)\n   When an extranet is formed, a customer\
    \ agent from each of the\n   organizations first approves addition of a site to\
    \ an extranet VPN as\n   a business decision between the parties involved.  The\
    \ solution\n   SHOULD provide a means for these organizations to control extranet\n\
    \   communication involving the L3VPN exchange of traffic and routing\n   information.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Service Provider Independence
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Service Provider Independence\n   Customers MAY require VPN service that\
    \ spans multiple administrative\n   domains or service provider networks.  Therefore,\
    \ a VPN service MUST\n   be able to span multiple AS and SP networks, but still\
    \ act and appear\n   as a single, homogeneous VPN from a customer point of view.\n\
    \   A customer might also start with a VPN provided in a single AS with a\n  \
    \ certain SLA but then ask for an expansion of the service, spanning\n   multiple\
    \ ASes/SPs.  In this case, as well as for all kinds of multi-\n   AS/SP VPNs,\
    \ VPN service SHOULD be able to deliver the same SLA to all\n   sites in a VPN\
    \ regardless of the AS/SP to which it homes.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Addressing
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Addressing\n   A customer requires support from an L3VPN for the following\n\
    \   addressing IP assignment schemes:\n   o  Customer-assigned, non-unique, or\
    \ [RFC1918] private addresses\n   o  Globally unique addresses obtained by the\
    \ customer\n   o  Globally unique addresses statically assigned by the L3VPN service\n\
    \      provider\n   o  On-demand, dynamically assigned IP addresses (e.g., DHCP),\n\
    \      irrespective of whether the access is temporary (e.g., remote) or\n   \
    \   permanent (e.g., dedicated)\n   In the case of combined L3VPN service with\
    \ non-unique or private\n   addresses and Internet access, mechanisms that permit\
    \ the exchange of\n   traffic between the customer's address space and the global\
    \ unique\n   Internet address space MAY be supported.  For example, NAT is\n \
    \  employed by many customers and by some service providers today to\n   meet\
    \ this need.  A preferred solution would be to assign unique\n   addresses, either\
    \ IPv4 or IPv6; however, some customers do not want\n   to renumber their networks.\n"
- title: 5.4.  Routing Protocol Support
  contents:
  - "5.4.  Routing Protocol Support\n   There SHOULD be no restriction on the routing\
    \ protocols used between\n   CE and PE routers, or between CE routers.  At least\
    \ the following\n   protocols MUST be supported: static routing, IGP protocols\
    \ such as\n   RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, and BGP [L3VPN-FR].\n"
- title: 5.5.  Quality of Service and Traffic Parameters
  contents:
  - "5.5.  Quality of Service and Traffic Parameters\n   QoS is expected to be an\
    \ important aspect of an L3VPN service for\n   some customers.  QoS requirements\
    \ cover scenarios involving an\n   intranet, an extranet, and shared access between\
    \ a VPN site and the\n   Internet.\n"
- title: 5.5.1.  Application-Level QoS Objectives
  contents:
  - "5.5.1.  Application-Level QoS Objectives\n   A customer is concerned primarily\
    \ that the L3VPN service provides his\n   or her applications with the QoS and\
    \ level of traffic so that the\n   applications perform acceptably.  Voice, interactive\
    \ video, and\n   multimedia applications are expected to require the most stringent\n\
    \   QoS.  These real-time applications are sensitive to delay, delay\n   variation,\
    \ loss, availability, and/or reliability.  Another set of\n   applications, including\
    \ some multimedia and interactive video\n   applications, high-performance web\
    \ browsing, and file transfer\n   intensive applications, requires near real time\
    \ performance.\n   Finally, best effort applications are not sensitive to degradation,\n\
    \   that is they are elastic and can adapt to conditions of degraded\n   performance.\n\
    \   The selection of appropriate QoS and service type to meet specific\n   application\
    \ requirements is particularly important to deal with\n   periods of congestion\
    \ in an SP network.  Sensitive applications will\n   likely select per-flow Integrated\
    \ service (Intserv) with precise SLA\n   guarantees measured on a per-flow basis.\
    \  On the other hand, non-\n   sensitive applications will likely rely on a Diffserv\
    \ class-based\n   QoS.\n   The fundamental customer application requirement is\
    \ that an L3VPN\n   solution MUST support both the Intserv QoS model for selected\n\
    \   individual flows and Diffserv for aggregated flows.\n   A customer application\
    \ SHOULD experience consistent QoS independent\n   of the access network technology\
    \ used at different sites connected to\n   the same VPN.\n"
- title: 5.5.2.  DSCP Transparency
  contents:
  - "5.5.2.  DSCP Transparency\n   The Diffserv Code Point (DSCP) set by a user as\
    \ received by the\n   ingress CE SHOULD be capable of being relayed transparently\
    \ to the\n   egress CE (see section 2.6.2 of [RFC3270] and [Y.1311.1]).  Although\n\
    \   RFC 2475 states that interior or boundary nodes within a DS domain\n   can\
    \ change the DSCP, customer VPNs MAY have other requirements, such\n   as\n  \
    \ o  applications that use the DSCP in a manner differently from the\n      DSCP\
    \ solution supported by the SP network(s),\n   o  customers using more DSCPs within\
    \ their sites than the SP\n      network(s) supports,\n   o  support for a carrier's\
    \ carrier service in which one SP is the\n      customer of another L3VPN SP.\
    \  Such an SP should be able to resell\n      VPN service to his or her VPN customers\
    \ independently of the DSCP\n      mapping solution supported by the carrier's\
    \ carrier SP.\n   Note that support for DSCP transparency has no implication on\
    \ the QoS\n   or SLA requirements.  If an SP supports DSCP transparency, then\
    \ that\n   SP needs to carry only the DSCP values across its domain but MAY map\n\
    \   the received DSCP to some other value for QoS support across its\n   domain.\n"
- title: 5.6.  Service-Level Specification/Agreement
  contents:
  - "5.6.  Service-Level Specification/Agreement\n   Most customers simply want their\
    \ applications to perform well.  An\n   SLA is a vehicle for customer recourse\
    \ in the event that SP(s) do not\n   perform or manage a VPN service well in a\
    \ measurable sense.\n   Therefore, when purchasing service under an SLA, a customer\
    \ agent\n   MUST have access to the measures from the SP(s) that support the SLA.\n"
- title: 5.7.  Customer Management of a VPN
  contents:
  - "5.7.  Customer Management of a VPN\n   A customer MUST have a means to view the\
    \ topology, operational state,\n   order status, and other parameters associated\
    \ with his or her VPN.\n   Most aspects of management information about CE devices\
    \ and customer\n   attributes of an L3VPN manageable by an SP SHOULD be capable\
    \ of being\n   configured and maintained by an authenticated, authorized customer\n\
    \   agent.  However, some aspects, such as encryption keys, SHALL NOT be\n   readable\
    \ nor writable by management systems.\n   A customer agent SHOULD be able to make\
    \ dynamic requests for changes\n   to traffic parameters.  A customer SHOULD be\
    \ able to receive real-\n   time response from the SP network in response to these\
    \ requests.  One\n   example of such service is a \"Dynamic Bandwidth management\"\
    \n   capability that enables real-time response to customer requests for\n   changes\
    \ of allocated bandwidth allocated to his or her VPN\n   [Y.1311.1].\n   A customer\
    \ who may not be able to afford the resources to manage his\n   own sites SHOULD\
    \ be able to outsource the management of the entire\n   VPN to the SP(s) supporting\
    \ the VPN network.\n"
- title: 5.8.  Isolation
  contents:
  - "5.8.  Isolation\n   These features include traffic and routing information exchange\n\
    \   isolation, similar to that obtained in VPNs based on Layer 1 and\n   Layer\
    \ 2 (e.g., private lines, FR, or ATM) [MPLSSEC].\n"
- title: 5.9.  Security
  contents:
  - "5.9.  Security\n   The suite of L3VPN solutions SHOULD support a range of security\n\
    \   related features.  Higher levels of security services, such as edge-\n   to-edge\
    \ encryption, authentication, or replay attack, should be\n   supported.  More\
    \ details on customer requirements for security are\n   described in [VPNSEC].\n\
    \   Security in an L3VPN service SHOULD be as transparent as possible to\n   the\
    \ customer, with the obvious exception of support for remote or\n   temporary\
    \ user access, as detailed in section 5.11.2.\n   L3VPN customers MUST be able\
    \ to deploy their own internal security\n   mechanisms in addition to those deployed\
    \ by the SP, in order to\n   secure specific applications or traffic at a granularity\
    \ finer than\n   that on a site-to-site basis.\n   If a customer requires QoS\
    \ support in an L3VPN, then this request\n   MUST be communicated to the SP either\
    \ by using unencrypted fields or\n   via an agreed security association.  For\
    \ example, applications could\n   send RSVP messages in support of Intserv either\
    \ in the clear or\n   encrypted with a key negotiated with the SP.  Another case\
    \ is that\n   where applications using an IPsec tunnel could copy the DSCP from\
    \ the\n   encrypted IP header to the header of the tunnel's IP header.\n"
- title: 5.10.  Migration Impact
  contents:
  - "5.10.  Migration Impact\n   Often, customers are migrating from an already deployed\
    \ private\n   network toward one or more L3VPN solutions.  A typical private\n\
    \   network scenario is CE routers connected via real or virtual\n   circuits.\
    \  Ideally, minimal incremental cost SHOULD result during the\n   migration period.\
    \  Furthermore, if necessary, any disruption of\n   service SHOULD also be minimized.\n\
    \   A range of scenarios of customer migration MUST be supported.  Full\n   migration\
    \ of all sites MUST be supported.  Support for cases of\n   partial migration\
    \ is highly desirable [Y.1311.1] -  that is, legacy\n   private network sites\
    \ that belong to the L3VPN service SHOULD still\n   have L3 reachability to the\
    \ sites that migrate to the L3VPN service.\n"
- title: 5.11.  Network Access
  contents:
  - "5.11.  Network Access\n   Every L3 packet exchanged between the customer and\
    \ the SP over the\n   access connection MUST appear as it would on a private network\n\
    \   providing an equivalent service to that offered by the L3VPN.\n"
- title: 5.11.1.  Physical/Link Layer Technology
  contents:
  - "5.11.1.  Physical/Link Layer Technology\n   L3VPNs SHOULD support a broad range\
    \ of physical and link-layer access\n   technologies, such as PSTN, ISDN, xDSL,\
    \ cable modem, leased line,\n   Ethernet, Ethernet VLAN, ATM, Frame Relay, Wireless\
    \ local loop, and\n   mobile radio access.  The capacity and QoS achievable may\
    \ be\n   dependent on the specific access technology in use.\n"
- title: 5.11.2.  Temporary Access
  contents:
  - "5.11.2.  Temporary Access\n   The VPN service offering SHOULD allow both permanent\
    \ and temporary\n   access to one or more L3VPNs for authenticated users across\
    \ a broad\n   range of access technologies.  Support for remote or temporary VPN\n\
    \   access SHOULD include ISDN, PSTN dial-in, xDSL, or access via another\n  \
    \ SP network.  The customer SHOULD be able to choose from alternatives\n   for\
    \ authentication of temporary access users.  Choices for access\n   authentication\
    \ are SP-provided, third-party, or customer-provided\n   authentication.\n   A\
    \ significant number of VPN users may not be permanently attached to\n   one VPN\
    \ site: in order to limit access to a VPN to authorized users,\n   it is first\
    \ necessary to authenticate them.  Authentication SHALL\n   apply as configured\
    \ by the customer agent and/or SP where a specific\n   user may be part of one\
    \ or more VPNs.  The authentication function\n   SHOULD be used to invoke all\
    \ actions necessary to join a user to the\n   VPN automatically.\n   A user SHOULD\
    \ be able to access an L3VPN via a network having generic\n   Internet access.\n\
    \   Mobile users may move within an L3VPN site.  Mobile users may also\n   have\
    \ temporary connections to different L3VPN sites within the same\n   VPN.  Authentication\
    \ SHOULD be provided in both of these cases.\n"
- title: 5.11.3.  Sharing of the Access Network
  contents:
  - "5.11.3.  Sharing of the Access Network\n   In a PE-based L3VPN, if the site shares\
    \ the access network with other\n   traffic (e.g., access to the Internet), then\
    \ data security in the\n   access network is the responsibility of the L3VPN customer.\n"
- title: 5.11.4.  Access Connectivity
  contents:
  - "5.11.4.  Access Connectivity\n   Various types of physical connectivity scenarios\
    \ MUST be supported,\n   such as multi-homed sites, backdoor links between customer\
    \ sites, and\n   devices homed to two or more SP networks.  L3VPN solutions SHOULD\n\
    \   support at least the types of physical or link-layer connectivity\n   arrangements\
    \ shown in Figure 2.1.  Support for other physical\n   connectivity scenarios\
    \ with arbitrary topology is desirable.\n   Access arrangements with multiple\
    \ physical or logical paths from a CE\n   to other CEs and PEs MUST support redundancy\
    \ and SHOULD support load\n   balancing.  Resiliency uses redundancy to provide\
    \ connectivity\n   between a CE site and other CE sites and, optionally, other\
    \ services.\n   Load balancing provides a means to perform traffic engineering\
    \ so\n   that capacity on redundant links is used to achieve improved\n   performance\
    \ during periods when the redundant component(s) are\n   available.\n   For multi-homing\
    \ to a single SP, load balancing capability SHOULD be\n   supported by the PE\
    \ across the CE to PE links.  For example, in case\n   (a), load balancing SHOULD\
    \ be provided by the two PEs over the two\n   links connecting to the single CE.\
    \  In case (c), load balancing\n   SHOULD be provided by the two PEs over the\
    \ two links connecting to\n   the two CEs.\n   In addition, the load-balancing\
    \ parameters (e.g., the ratio of\n   traffic on the multiple load-balanced links,\
    \ or the preferred link)\n   SHOULD be provisionable based on customer's requirements.\
    \  The load-\n   balancing capability may also be used to achieve resiliency in\
    \ the\n   event of access connectivity failures.  For example, in case (b) a CE\n\
    \   may connect to two different SPs via diverse access networks.\n   Resiliency\
    \ MAY be further enhanced as shown in case (d), where CEs\n   connected via a\
    \ \"back door\" connection connect to different SPs.\n   Furthermore, arbitrary\
    \ combinations of the above methods, with a few\n   examples shown in cases (e)\
    \ and (f), should be supportable by any\n   L3VPN approach.\n   For multi-homing\
    \ to multiple SPs, load balancing capability MAY also\n   be supported by the\
    \ PEs in the different SPs (clearly, this is a more\n   complex type of load balancing\
    \ to realize, requiring policy and\n   service agreements between the SPs to interoperate).\n\

    \ of alarms reports and diagnostics),\n   -  incident recording or logs (creation\
    \ and follow-through of trouble\n      tickets), and\n   -  corrective actions\
    \ (traffic, routing, and resource allocation).\n   As PE-based VPNs rely on a\
    \ common network infrastructure, the NMS\n   MUST provide a means to inform the\
    \ provider of the VPN customers\n   impacted by a failure in the infrastructure.\
    \  The NMS SHOULD provide\n   pointers to the related customer configuration information\

    \ faults caused by configuration errors is desirable, because\n   these may cause\

  contents:
  - "7.2.  Configuration Management\n   Overall, the NMS must support a configuration\
    \ necessary to realize\n   the desired L3-reachability of an L3VPN.  Toward this\
    \ end, an NMS\n   MUST provide configuration management to provision at least\
    \ the\n   following L3VPN components: PE,CE, hierarchical tunnels, access\n  \
    \ connections, routing, and QoS, as detailed in this section.  If\n   shared access\
    \ to the Internet is provided, then this option MUST also\n   be configurable.\n\
    \   As VPN configuration and topology are highly dependent on a\n   customer's\
    \ organization, provisioning systems MUST address a broad\n   range of customer-specific\
    \ requirements.  The NMS MUST ensure that\n   these devices and protocols are\
    \ provisioned consistently and\n   correctly.\n   Provisioning for adding or removing\
    \ sites SHOULD be as localized and\n   automated as possible.\n   Configuration\
    \ management for VPNs, according to service templates\n   defined by the provider\
    \ MUST be supported.  A service template\n   contains fields that, when used,\
    \ yield a definite service requirement\n   or policy.  For example, a template\
    \ for an IPSec tunnel would contain\n   fields such as tunnel end points, authentication\
    \ modes, encryption\n   and authentication algorithms, pre-shared keys (if any),\
    \ and traffic\n   filters.  An SLA template would contain fields such as delay,\
    \ jitter,\n   and throughput and packet loss thresholds, as well as end points\
    \ over\n   which the SLA has to be satisfied.  In general, a customer's service\n\
    \   order can be regarded as a set of instantiated service templates.\n   This\
    \ set can, in turn, be regarded as the logical service\n   architecture of the\
    \ customer's VPN.\n   Service templates can also be used by the provider to define\
    \ the\n   service architecture of the provider's own network.  For example,\n\
    \   OSPF templates could contain fields such as the subnets that form a\n   particular\
    \ area, the area identifier, and the area type.  BGP service\n   template could\
    \ contain fields that, when used, would yield a BGP\n   policy, such as for expressing\
    \ a preference about an exit router for\n   a particular destination.\n   The\
    \ set of service templates SHOULD be comprehensive in that it can\n   capture\
    \ all service orders in some meaningful sense.\n   The provider SHOULD provide\
    \ means to translate service templates into\n   device configurations so that\
    \ associated services can be provisioned.\n   Finally, the approach SHOULD provide\
    \ means to check whether a service\n   order is correctly provisioned.  This would\
    \ represent one method of\n   diagnosing configuration errors.  Configuration\

    \ an information model MUST allow\n   an SP to change VPN network dimensions with\
    \ minimal influence on\n   provisioning issues.  The adopted model SHOULD be applicable\
    \ to both\n   small/medium size and large-scale L3VPN scenarios.\n   Some service\
    \ providers MAY require systems that visually, audibly, or\n   logically present\
    \ FCAPS information to internal operators and/or\n   customers.\n"

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   Security considerations occur at several levels\
    \ and dimensions within\n   L3VPNs, as detailed within this document.  This section\
    \ provides a\n   summary with references to detailed supporting information\n\
    \   [L3VPN-SEC] [VPNSEC].\n   The requirements in this document separate traditional\
    \ notions of\n   security requirements, such as integrity, confidentiality, and\n\
    \   authentication, from issues such as isolating (or separating) the\n   exchange\
    \ of VPN data and control traffic between specific sets of\n   sites (as defined\
    \ in sections 3.3 and 4.1).  Further detail on\n   security requirements is given\
    \ from the customer and service provider\n   perspectives in sections 5.9 and\
    \ 6.9, respectively.  Further detail\n   on data and control traffic isolation\
    \ requirements are given from the\n   customer and service provider perspectives\
    \ in sections 5.1 and 6.8,\n   respectively.\n   Furthermore, requirements regarding\
    \ management of security from a\n   service provider perspective are described\
    \ in section 7.5.\n"
