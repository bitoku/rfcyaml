Abstract This document requires that Transport Layer Security (TLS) clients and servers never negotiate the use of RC4 cipher suites when they establish connections.
This applies to all TLS versions.
This document updates RFCs 5246, 4346, and 2246.
Introduction RC4 is a stream cipher that is described in [SCH]; it is widely supported, and often preferred by TLS servers.
However, RC4 has long been known to have a variety of cryptographic weaknesses, e.g., see [PAU], [MAN], and [FLU].
Recent cryptanalysis results [ALF] exploit biases in the RC4 keystream to recover repeatedly encrypted plaintexts.
These recent results are on the verge of becoming practically exploitable; currently, they require 2^26 sessions or 13x2^30 encryptions.
As a result, RC4 can no longer be seen as providing a sufficient level of security for TLS sessions.
This document requires that TLS ([RFC5246] [RFC4346]
[RFC2246]) clients and servers never negotiate the use of RC4 cipher suites.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
Because of the RC4 deficiencies noted in Section 1, the following apply:
TLS clients MUST NOT include RC4 cipher suites in the ClientHello message.
TLS servers MUST NOT select an RC4 cipher suite when a TLS client sends such a cipher suite in the ClientHello message.
If the TLS client only offers RC4 cipher suites, the TLS server MUST terminate the handshake.
The TLS server MAY send the insufficient security fatal alert in this case.
Appendix A lists the RC4 cipher suites defined for TLS.
This document helps maintain the security guarantees of the TLS protocol by prohibiting the use of the RC4 based cipher suites (listed in Appendix A), which do not provide a sufficiently high level of security.
The following cipher suites defined for TLS use RC4:  TLS RSA EXPORT WITH RC4 40 MD5  TLS RSA WITH RC4 128 MD5  TLS RSA WITH RC4 128 SHA
TLS DH anon EXPORT WITH RC4 40 MD5  TLS DH anon WITH RC4 128 MD5  TLS KRB5 WITH RC4 128
TLS KRB5 WITH RC4 128 MD5
TLS KRB5 EXPORT WITH RC4 40 SHA
TLS KRB5 EXPORT WITH RC4 40 MD5
TLS DHE PSK WITH RC4 128
TLS RSA PSK WITH RC4 128
TLS ECDH ECDSA WITH RC4 128 SHA
TLS ECDHE ECDSA WITH RC4 128
TLS ECDH RSA WITH RC4 128 SHA
RC4 128 SHA  TLS ECDH anon WITH RC4 128 SHA
