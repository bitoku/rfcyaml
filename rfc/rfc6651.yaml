- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   DomainKeys Identified Mail [DKIM] introduced a mechanism\
    \ for message\n   signing and authentication.  It uses digital signing to associate\
    \ a\n   domain name with a message in a reliable manner.  The verified domain\n\
    \   name can then be evaluated (e.g., checking advertised sender policy,\n   comparison\
    \ to a known-good list, submission to a reputation service,\n   etc.).\n   Deployers\
    \ of message authentication technologies are increasingly\n   seeking visibility\
    \ into DKIM verification failures and conformance\n   failures involving the published\
    \ signing practices (e.g., Author\n   Domain Signing Practices [ADSP]) of an ADministrative\
    \ Management\n   Domain (ADMD; see [EMAIL-ARCH]).\n   This document extends [DKIM]\
    \ and [ADSP] to add an optional reporting\n   address and some reporting parameters.\
    \  Reports are generated using\n   the format defined in [ARF-AUTHFAIL].\n"

- title: 3.2.  DKIM Reporting TXT Record
  contents:
  - "3.2.  DKIM Reporting TXT Record\n   When a Signer wishes to advertise that it\
    \ wants to receive failed\n   verification reports, it places in the DNS a TXT\
    \ Resource Record\n   (RR).  The RR contains a sequence of tag-value objects in\
    \ a format\n   similar to DKIM key records (see Section 3.6.1 of [DKIM]), but\
    \ it is\n   entirely independent of those key records and is found at a different\n\
    \   name.  The tag-value objects in this case comprise the parameters to\n   be\
    \ used when generating the reports.  A report generator will request\n   the content\
    \ of this record when it sees an \"r=\" tag in a\n   DKIM-Signature header field.\n\
    \   Section 3.6.2.2 of [DKIM] provides guidance with respect to the\n   handling\
    \ of a TXT RR that comprises multiple distinct strings\n   (\"character-strings\"\
    \ in the parlance of [DNS]).  The same process\n   MUST be applied here.\n   Implementations\
    \ MUST support all tags defined in this document, and\n   any other tag found\
    \ in the content of the record that is not\n   recognized by an implementation\
    \ MUST be ignored.  See Section 7.3 for\n   details about finding or registering\
    \ extension tags.\n   The initial list of tags supported for the reporting TXT\
    \ record is as\n   follows:\n   ra=  Reporting Address (plain-text; OPTIONAL).\
    \  A\n        dkim-quoted-printable string (see Section 2.11 of [DKIM])\n    \
    \    containing the local-part of an email address to which a report\n       \
    \ SHOULD be sent when mail fails DKIM verification for one of the\n        reasons\
    \ enumerated below.  The value MUST be interpreted as a\n        local-part only.\
    \  To construct the actual address to which the\n        report is sent, the Verifier\
    \ simply appends to this value an \"@\"\n        followed by the domain name found\
    \ in the \"d=\" tag of the\n        DKIM-Signature header field.  Therefore, a\
    \ Signer making use of\n        this specification MUST ensure that an email address\
    \ thus\n        constructed can receive reports generated as described in\n  \
    \      Section 6.\n      ABNF:\n      rep-ra-tag = %x72.61 *WSP \"=\" *WSP dkim-quoted-printable\n\
    \                 ; \"ra=...\" (lower-case only for the tag name)\n   rp=  Requested\
    \ Report Percentage (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is\n        \"100\").  The\
    \ value is an integer from 0 to 100 inclusive that\n        indicates what percentage\
    \ of incidents of signature\n        authentication failures, selected at random,\
    \ are to cause\n        reports to be generated.  The report generator SHOULD\
    \ NOT issue\n        reports for more than the requested percentage of incidents.\n\
    \        Report generators MAY make use of the \"Incidents:\" field in\n     \
    \   [ARF] to indicate that there are more reportable incidents than\n        there\
    \ are reports.\n      ABNF:\n      rep-rp-tag = %x72.70 *WSP \"=\" *WSP 1*3DIGIT\n\

    \ list of tokens representing\n        those conditions under which a report is\
    \ desired.  See\n        Section 5.1 for a list of valid tokens.\n      ABNF:\n\
    \      rep-rr-type = ( \"all\" / \"d\" / \"o\" / \"p\" / \"s\" / \"u\" / \"v\"\

    \ only for the tag name)\n   rs=  Requested SMTP Error String (plain-text; OPTIONAL;\
    \ no default).\n        The value is a dkim-quoted-printable string that the publishing\n\
    \        ADMD requests be included in [SMTP] error strings if messages\n     \
    \   are rejected during the delivery SMTP session.\n      ABNF:\n      rep-rs-tag\

    \ \"rr=\" tags MUST be\n   ignored, and the report generator MUST NOT issue a\
    \ report.\n"
- title: 3.3.  DKIM Reporting Algorithm
  contents:
  - "3.3.  DKIM Reporting Algorithm\n   Report generators MUST apply the following\
    \ algorithm, or one\n   semantically equivalent to it, for each DKIM-Signature\
    \ header field\n   whose verification fails for some reason.  Note that this processing\n\
    \   is done as a reporting extension only; the outcome of the specified\n   DKIM\
    \ evaluation MUST be otherwise unaffected.\n   1.  If the DKIM-Signature field\
    \ did not contain a valid \"r=\" tag,\n       terminate.\n   2.  Issue a [DNS]\
    \ TXT query to the name that results from appending\n       the value of the \"\
    d=\" tag in the DKIM-Signature field to the\n       string \"_report._domainkey.\"\
    .  For example, if the DKIM-Signature\n       header field contains \"d=example.com\"\
    , issue a DNS TXT query to\n       \"_report._domainkey.example.com\".\n   3.\
    \  If the DNS query returns anything other than RCODE 0 (NOERROR),\n       or\
    \ if multiple TXT records are returned, terminate.\n   4.  If the resultant TXT\
    \ is in several string fragments, concatenate\n       them as described in Section\
    \ 3.6.2.2 of [DKIM].\n   5.  If the TXT content is syntactically invalid (see\
    \ Section 3.2),\n       terminate.\n   6.  If the reason for the signature evaluation\
    \ failure does not match\n       one of the report requests found in the \"rr=\"\
    \ tag (or its default\n       value), terminate.\n   7.  If a report percentage\
    \ (\"rp=\") tag was present, select a random\n       number between 0 and 99,\
    \ inclusive; if the selected number is not\n       lower than the tag's value,\
    \ terminate.\n   8.  If no \"ra=\" tag was present, skip this step and the next\
    \ one.\n       Otherwise, determine the reporting address by extracting the\n\
    \       value of the \"ra=\" tag and appending to it an \"@\" followed by the\n\
    \       domain name found in the \"d=\" tag of the DKIM-Signature header\n   \
    \    field.\n   9.  Construct and send a report in compliance with Section 6 of\
    \ this\n       document that includes as its intended recipient the address\n\
    \       constructed in the previous step.\n   10. If the [SMTP] session during\
    \ which the DKIM signature was\n       evaluated is still active and the SMTP\
    \ server has not already\n       given its response to the DATA command that relayed\
    \ the message,\n       and an \"rs=\" tag was present in the TXT record, the SMTP\
    \ server\n       SHOULD include the decoded string found in the \"rs=\" tag in\
    \ its\n       SMTP reply to the DATA command.\n   In order to thwart attacks that\
    \ seek to convert report generators\n   into unwitting denial-of-service attack\
    \ participants, a report\n   generator SHOULD NOT issue more than one report to\
    \ any given domain\n   as a result of a single message.  Further, a report generator\
    \ SHOULD\n   establish an upper bound on the number of reports a single message\n\
    \   can generate overall.  For example, a message with three invalid\n   signatures,\
    \ two from example.com and one from example.net, would\n   generate at most one\
    \ report to each of those domains.\n   This algorithm has the following advantages\
    \ over previous\n   pre-standardization implementations, such as early versions\
    \ of\n   [OPENDKIM]:\n   a.  If the DKIM signature fails to verify, no additional\
    \ DNS check is\n       made to see if reporting is requested; the request is active\
    \ in\n       that it is included in the DKIM-Signature header field.\n       (Previous\
    \ implementations included the reporting address in the\n       DKIM key record,\
    \ which is not queried for certain failure cases.\n       This meant, for full\
    \ reporting, that the key record had to be\n       retrieved even when it was\
    \ not otherwise necessary.)\n   b.  The request is confirmed by the presence of\
    \ a corresponding TXT\n       record in the DNS, since the Signer thus provides\
    \ the parameters\n       required to construct and send the report.  This means\
    \ a\n       malicious Signer cannot falsely assert that someone else wants\n \
    \      failure reports and cause unwanted mail to be generated.  It can\n    \
    \   cause additional DNS traffic against the domain listed in the\n       \"d=\"\
    \ signature tag, but negative caching of the requested DNS\n       record will\
    \ help to mitigate this issue.\n   c.  It is not possible for a Signer to direct\
    \ reports to an email\n       address outside of its own domain, preventing distributed\
    \ email-\n       based denial-of-service attacks.\n   See Section 8.4 for some\
    \ considerations regarding limitations of this\n   mechanism.\n"

  - "4.  Optional Reporting Address for DKIM ADSP\n   A domain name owner employing\

  contents:
  - "8.2.  Report Volume\n   It is impossible to predict the volume of reports this\
    \ facility will\n   generate when enabled by a report receiver.  An implementer\
    \ ought to\n   anticipate substantial volume, since the amount of abuse occurring\
    \ at\n   receivers cannot be known ahead of time, and may vary rapidly and\n \
    \  unpredictably.\n"
- title: 8.3.  Deliberate Misuse
  contents:
  - "8.3.  Deliberate Misuse\n   Some threats caused by deliberate misuse of this\
    \ error-reporting\n   mechanism are discussed in Section 3.3, but they warrant\
    \ further\n   discussion here.\n   The presence of the DNS record that indicates\
    \ willingness to accept\n   reports opens the recipient to abuse.  In particular,\
    \ it is possible\n   for an attacker to attempt to cause a flood of reports toward\
    \ the\n   domain identified in a signature's \"d=\" tag in one of these ways:\n\
    \   1.  Alter existing DKIM-Signature header fields by adding an \"r=y\"\n   \
    \    tag (and possibly altering the \"d=\" tag to point at the target\n      \
    \ domain);\n   2.  Add a new but bogus signature bearing an \"r=y\" tag and a\
    \ \"d=\" tag\n       pointing at the target domain;\n   3.  Generate a completely\
    \ new message bearing an \"r=y\" tag and a \"d=\"\n       tag pointing at the\
    \ target domain.\n   Consider, for example, the situation where an attacker sends\
    \ out a\n   multi-million-message spam run and includes in the messages a fake\n\
    \   DKIM signature containing \"d=example.com; r=y\".  It won't matter that\n\
    \   those signatures couldn't possibly be real: each will fail\n   verification,\
    \ and any implementations that support this specification\n   will report those\
    \ failures, in the millions and in short order, to\n   example.com.\n   Implementers\
    \ are therefore strongly advised not to advertise the DNS\n   record specified\
    \ in this document except when failure reports are\n   desired.  Upon doing so,\
    \ unexpected traffic volumes and attacks\n   should be anticipated.\n   Negative\
    \ caching offers some protection against this pattern of\n   abuse, although it\
    \ will work only as long as the negative time-to-\n   live on the relevant SOA\
    \ record in the DNS.\n   Positive caching of this DNS reply also means that turning\
    \ off the\n   flow of reports by removing the record is not likely to have an\n\
    \   immediate effect.  A low time-to-live on the record needs to be\n   considered.\n"
- title: 8.4.  Unreported Fraud
  contents:
  - "8.4.  Unreported Fraud\n   An attacker can craft fraudulent DKIM-Signature fields\
    \ on messages,\n   without using \"r=\" tags, and avoid having these reported.\
    \  The\n   procedure described in Section 3.3 does not permit the detection and\n\
    \   reporting of such cases.\n   It might be useful to some Signers to receive\
    \ such reports, but the\n   mechanism does not support it.  To offer such support,\
    \ a Verifier\n   would have to violate the first step in the procedure and continue\n\
    \   even in the absence of an \"r=\" tag.  Although that would enable the\n  \
    \ desired report, it would also create a possible denial-of-service\n   attack:\
    \ such Verifiers would always look for the reporting TXT\n   record, so a generator\
    \ of fraudulent messages could simply send a\n   large volume of messages without\
    \ an \"r=\" tag to a number of\n   destinations.  To avoid that outcome, reports\
    \ of fraudulent\n   DKIM-Signature header fields are not possible using the published\n\
    \   mechanism.\n"
