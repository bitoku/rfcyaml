  - "1.  Introduction\n   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)\
    \ is to\n   provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several\n\
    \   hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired\n   resource\
    \ [RFC5693].  ALTO is realized by a client-server protocol;\n   see requirement\
    \ AR-1 in [RFC6708].  Before an ALTO client can ask for\n   guidance it needs\
    \ to discover one or more ALTO servers that can\n   provide guidance to this specific\
    \ client.\n   This document specifies a procedure for resource-consumer-initiated\n\
    \   ALTO server discovery, which can be used if the ALTO client is\n   embedded\
    \ in the resource consumer.  In other words, this document\n   meets requirement\
    \ AR-32 in [RFC6708] while AR-33 is out of scope.  A\n   different approach, which\
    \ tries to meet requirement AR-33, i.e.,\n   third-party ALTO server discovery,\
    \ is addressed in [3PDISC].\n   A more detailed discussion of various options\
    \ on where to place the\n   functional entities comprising the overall ALTO architecture\
    \ can be\n   found in [ALTO-DEPLOY].\n   The ALTO protocol specification [RFC7285]\
    \ is based on HTTP and\n   expects the discovery procedure to yield the HTTP(S)\
    \ URI of an ALTO\n   server's Information Resource Directory (IRD).  Therefore,\
    \ this\n   procedure is based on a combination of the Dynamic Host Configuration\n\
    \   Protocol (DHCP) or local configuration and URI-enabled Naming\n   Authority\
    \ Pointer (U-NAPTR) resource records in the Domain Name\n   System (DNS), in order\
    \ to deliver such URIs.\n"

- title: 2.  ALTO Server Discovery Procedure Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  ALTO Server Discovery Procedure Overview\n   The ALTO protocol specification\
    \ [RFC7285] expects that the ALTO\n   discovery procedure yields the HTTP(S) URI\
    \ [RFC7230] of the ALTO\n   server's Information Resource Directory (IRD), which\
    \ gives further\n   information about the capabilities and services provided by\
    \ that ALTO\n   server.\n   On hosts with more than one interface or address family\
    \ (IPv4/v6),\n   the ALTO server discovery procedure has to be run for every interface\n\
    \   and address family.  For more details see Section 4.2.\n   The ALTO server\
    \ discovery procedure is performed in two steps:\n   1.  One DNS domain name is\
    \ retrieved for each combination of\n       interface and address family, either\
    \ by local configuration\n       (e.g., manual input into a menu or configuration\
    \ file) or by\n       means of DHCP.\n   2.  These DNS domain names are used for\
    \ U-NAPTR lookups yielding one\n       or more URIs.  Further DNS lookups may\
    \ be necessary to determine\n       the ALTO server's IP address(es).\n   The\
    \ primary means for retrieving the DNS domain name is DHCP.\n   However, there\
    \ may be situations where DHCP is not available or does\n   not return a suitable\
    \ value.  Furthermore, there might be situations\n   in which the user wishes\
    \ to override the value that could be\n   retrieved from DHCP.  In these situations,\
    \ local configuration may be\n   used.  Consequently, the algorithm first checks\
    \ for a locally\n   configured override, before it tries to retrieve a value from\
    \ DHCP.\n   Typically, but not necessarily, the DNS domain name is the domain\n\
    \   name in which the client is located, i.e., a PTR lookup on the\n   client's\
    \ IP address (according to [RFC1035], Section 3.5 for IPv4 or\n   [RFC3596], Section\
    \ 2.5 for IPv6) would yield a similar name.\n   However, due to the widespread\
    \ use of Network Address Translation\n   (NAT), trying to determine the DNS domain\
    \ name through a PTR lookup\n   on an interface's IP address is not recommended\
    \ for resource consumer\n   initiated ALTO server discovery (see also [RFC3424]).\n"
- title: 3.  ALTO Server Discovery Procedure Specification
  contents:
  - "3.  ALTO Server Discovery Procedure Specification\n   As already outlined in\
    \ Section 2, the ALTO server discovery procedure\n   is performed for every address\
    \ family on every interface the\n   application considers for communicating with\
    \ resource providers.\n   First, the algorithm checks for a locally configured\
    \ domain name, as\n   specified in Section 3.1.1.  If no such name was configured,\
    \ it tries\n   to retrieve one from DHCP, as specified in Section 3.1.2.  If still\n\
    \   no domain name could be found, the procedure has failed and\n   terminates\
    \ with an appropriate error code.\n   If one or more domain names were found,\
    \ they will be used as U-NAPTR/\n   DDDS (URI-Enabled NAPTR/Dynamic Delegation\
    \ Discovery Service)\n   [RFC4848] application-unique strings for a DNS lookup,\
    \ as specified\n   in Section 3.2.\n"

  - "3.1.1.  Step 1, Option 1: Local Configuration\n   The preferred way to acquire\
    \ a domain name related to an interface's\n   point of network attachment is the\
    \ use of DHCP (see Section 3.1.2).\n   However, in some network deployment scenarios,\
    \ there is no DHCP\n   server available.  Furthermore, a user may want to use\
    \ an ALTO\n   service instance provided by an entity that is not the operator\
    \ of\n   the underlying IP network.  Therefore, we allow the user to specify a\n\
    \   DNS domain name, for example, in a configuration file option.  An\n   example\
    \ domain name is:\n      my-alternative-alto-provider.example.org\n   Implementations\
    \ MAY give the user the opportunity (e.g., by means of\n   configuration file\
    \ options or menu items) to specify an individual\n   domain name for every address\
    \ family on every interface.\n   Implementations SHOULD allow the user to specify\
    \ a default name that\n   is used if no more specific name has been configured.\n"

  - "3.1.2.  Step 1, Option 2: DHCP\n   Network operators may provide the domain name\
    \ to be used for service\n   discovery within an access network using DHCP.\n\
    \   RFC 5986 [RFC5986] defines DHCP IPv4 and IPv6 access network domain\n   name\
    \ options to identify a domain name that is suitable for service\n   discovery\
    \ within the access network.  RFC 2132 [RFC2132] defines the\n   DHCP IPv4 domain\
    \ name option.  While this option is less suitable, it\n   still may be useful\
    \ if the RFC 5986 option is not available.\n   For IPv6, the ALTO server discovery\
    \ procedure MUST try to retrieve\n   DHCP option 57 (OPTION_V6_ACCESS_DOMAIN).\
    \  If no such option can be\n   retrieved the procedure fails for this interface.\
    \  For IPv4, the ALTO\n   server discovery procedure MUST try to retrieve DHCP\
    \ option 213\n   (OPTION_V4_ACCESS_DOMAIN).  If no such option can be retrieved,\
    \ the\n   procedure SHOULD try to retrieve option 15 (Domain Name).  If neither\n\
    \   option can be retrieved, the procedure fails for this interface.  If\n   a\
    \ result can be retrieved, it will be used as an input for the next\n   step (U-NAPTR\

    \   In the second step, the ALTO server discovery procedure uses a\n   U-NAPTR\

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Issues with Home Gateways\n   Section 3.1.2 describes the usage of a DHCP\
    \ option that provides a\n   means for the network operator of the network in\
    \ which the ALTO\n   client is located to provide a DNS domain name.  However,\
    \ this\n   assumes that this particular DHCP option is correctly passed from the\n\
    \   DHCP server to the actual host with the ALTO client, and that the\n   particular\
    \ host understands this DHCP option.  This memo assumes the\n   client to be able\
    \ to understand the proposed DHCP option; otherwise,\n   there is no further use\
    \ of the DHCP option, but the client has to use\n   the other proposed mechanisms.\n\
    \   There are well-known issues with the handling of DHCP options in home\n  \
    \ gateways.  One issue is that unknown DHCP options are not passed\n   through\
    \ some home gateways, effectively eliminating the DHCP option.\n   Another well-known\
    \ issue is the use of home-gateway-specific DNS\n   domain names that \"override\"\
    \ the DNS domain name provided by the\n   network operator.  For instance, a host\
    \ behind a home gateway may\n   receive a DNS domain name \".local\" instead of\
    \ \"example.net\".  In\n   general, this domain name is not usable for the server\
    \ discovery\n   procedure, unless a DNS server in the home gateway resolves the\n\
    \   corresponding NAPTR lookup correctly, e.g., by means of a DNS split\n   horizon\
    \ approach.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Issues with Multihoming, Mobility, and Changing IP Addresses
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Issues with Multihoming, Mobility, and Changing IP Addresses\n   If the\
    \ user decides to enter only one (default) DNS domain name in\n   the local configuration\
    \ facility (see Section 3.1.1), only one set of\n   ALTO servers will be discovered,\
    \ irrespective of multihoming and\n   mobility.  Particularly in mobile scenarios,\
    \ this can lead to\n   undesirable results.\n   The DHCP-based discovery method\
    \ can discover different sets of ALTO\n   servers for each interface and address\
    \ family (i.e., IPv4/v6).  In\n   general, if a client wishes to communicate using\
    \ one of its\n   interfaces and using a specific IP address family, it SHOULD\
    \ query\n   the ALTO server or servers that have been discovered for this\n  \
    \ specific interface and address family.  How to select an interface\n   and IP\
    \ address family as well as how to compare results returned from\n   different\
    \ ALTO servers are out of the scope of this document.\n   A change of the IP address\
    \ at an interface invalidates the result of\n   the ALTO server discovery procedure.\
    \  For instance, if the IP address\n   assigned to a mobile host changes due to\
    \ host mobility, it is\n   required to re-run the ALTO server discovery procedure\
    \ without\n   relying on earlier gained information.\n   There are several challenges\
    \ with DNS on hosts with multiple\n   interfaces [RFC6418], which can affect the\
    \ ALTO server discovery.  If\n   the DNS resolution is performed on the wrong\
    \ interface, it can return\n   an ALTO server that could provide suboptimal or\
    \ wrong guidance.\n   Finding the best ALTO server for multi-interfaced hosts\
    \ is outside\n   the scope of this document.\n   When using Virtual Private Network\
    \ (VPN) connections, there is\n   usually no DHCP.  The user has to enter the\
    \ DNS domain name in the\n   local configuration facility.  For good optimization\
    \ results, a DNS\n   domain name corresponding to the VPN concentrator, not corresponding\n\

- title: 6.1.  Integrity of the ALTO Server's URI
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Integrity of the ALTO Server's URI\n   Scenario Description\n      An attacker\
    \ could compromise the ALTO server discovery procedure\n      or infrastructure\
    \ in a way that ALTO clients would discover a\n      \"wrong\" ALTO server URI.\n\
    \   Threat Discussion\n      This is probably the most serious security concern\
    \ related to ALTO\n      server discovery.  The discovered \"wrong\" ALTO server\
    \ might not be\n      able to give guidance to a given ALTO client at all, or\
    \ it might\n      give suboptimal or forged information.  In the latter case,\
    \ an\n      attacker could try to use ALTO to affect the traffic distribution\n\
    \      in the network or the performance of applications (see also\n      Section\
    \ 15.1. of [RFC7285]).  Furthermore, a hostile ALTO server\n      could threaten\
    \ user privacy (see also Section 5.2.1, case (5a) in\n      [RFC6708]).\n    \
    \  However, it should also be noted that, if an attacker was able to\n      compromise\
    \ DHCP and/or DNS servers used for ALTO server discovery\n      (see below), (s)he\
    \ could also launch significantly more serious\n      other attacks (e.g., redirecting\
    \ various application protocols).\n   Protection Strategies and Mechanisms\n \
    \     The ALTO server discovery procedure consists of three building\n      blocks\
    \ (local configuration, DHCP, and DNS) and each of them is a\n      possible attack\
    \ vector.\n      The problem of users possibly following \"bad advice\" that tricks\n\
    \      them into manually configuring unsuitable ALTO servers cannot be\n    \
    \  solved by technical means and is out of the scope of this\n      document.\n\
    \      Due to the nature of the protocol, DHCP is rather prone to\n      attacks.\
    \  As already mentioned, an attacker that is able to inject\n      forged DHCP\
    \ replies into the network may do significantly more\n      harm than only configuring\
    \ a wrong ALTO server.  Best current\n      practices for safely operating DHCP\
    \ should be followed.\n      A further threat is the possible alteration of the\
    \ DNS records\n      used in U-NAPTR resolution.  If an attacker was able to modify\
    \ or\n      spoof any of the DNS records used in the DDDS resolution, this URI\n\
    \      could be replaced by a forged URI.  The application of DNS\n      security\
    \ (DNSSEC) [RFC4033] provides a means to limit attacks that\n      rely on modification\
    \ of the DNS records used in U-NAPTR\n      resolution.  Security considerations\
    \ specific to U-NAPTR are\n      described in more detail in [RFC4848].\n    \
    \  A related risk is the impersonation of the ALTO server (i.e.,\n      attacks\
    \ after the correct URI has been discovered).  This threat\n      and protection\
    \ strategies are discussed in Section 15.1 of\n      [RFC7285].  Note that if\
    \ Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used to\n      protect ALTO, the server certificate\
    \ will contain the host name\n      (CN).  Consequently, only the host part of\
    \ the HTTPS URI will be\n      authenticated, i.e., the result of the ALTO server\
    \ discovery\n      procedure.  The U-NAPTR based mapping within the ALTO server\n\
    \      discovery procedure needs to be secured as described above, e.g.,\n   \
    \   by using DNSSEC.\n      In addition to active protection mechanisms, users\
    \ and network\n      operators can monitor application performance and network\
    \ traffic\n      patterns for poor performance or abnormalities.  If it turns\
    \ out\n      that relying on the guidance of a specific ALTO server does not\n\
    \      result in better-than-random outcomes, the use of the ALTO server\n   \
    \   may be discontinued (see also Section 15.2 of [RFC7285]).\n"

  - "6.2.  Availability of the ALTO Server Discovery Procedure\n   Scenario Description\n\
    \      An attacker could compromise the ALTO server discovery procedure\n    \
    \  or infrastructure in a way that ALTO clients would not be able to\n      discover\
    \ any ALTO server.\n   Threat Discussion\n      If no ALTO server can be discovered\
    \ (although a suitable one\n      exists), applications have to make their decisions\
    \ without ALTO\n      guidance.  As ALTO could be temporarily unavailable for\
    \ many\n      reasons, applications must be prepared to do so.  However, the\n\
    \      resulting application performance and traffic distribution will\n     \
    \ correspond to a deployment scenario without ALTO.\n   Protection Strategies\
    \ and Mechanisms\n      Operators should follow best current practices to secure\
    \ their\n      DHCP, DNS, and ALTO (see Section 15.5 of [RFC7285]) servers\n \
    \     against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.\n"
