Abstract This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
In particular, it defines objects for managing IEEE 802.3 Medium Attachment Units (MAUs).
The Internet standard Network Management Framework consists of three components.
They are: STD 16, RFC 1155 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
STD 16, RFC 1212 [7] defines a more concise description mechanism, which is wholly consistent with the SMI.
STD 17, RFC 1213 [4] which defines MIB II, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
STD 15, RFC 1157 [3] which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Object Definitions Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.
Overview Instances of the object types defined in this document represent attributes of an IEEE 802.3 MAU.
Several types of MAUs are defined in the IEEE 802.3
/ISO 8802 3 CSMA/CD standard [9].
These MAUs may be connected to IEEE 802.3 repeaters or to 802.3 (Ethernet like) interfaces.
For convenience this document refers to these devices as "repeater MAUs" and "interface MAUs.
" The definitions presented here are based on Draft 5 of Section 20 of IEEE P802.3p, "Layer Management for 10 Mb/s Medium Attachment Units (MAUs), Section 20" [10] dated 11 July 1992.
Terminology Refer to Section 3.1.2 of [13] for simple definitions of the terms "repeater," "port," and "MAU" as used in the context of this document.
For a more complete and precise definition of these terms, refer to Section 9 of [9].
Structure of MIB Objects in this MIB are arranged into MIB groups.
Each MIB group is organized as a set of related objects.
The Repeater MAU Basic Group Definitions
This group contains all repeater MAU related configuration, status, and control objects.
Implementation of the dot3RpMauBasicGroup is mandatory for MAUs attached to repeaters.
The Interface MAU Basic Group Definitions
This group contains all interface MAU related configuration, status, and control objects.
Implementation of the dot3IfMauBasicGroup is mandatory for MAUs attached to interfaces.
The Broadband MAU Basic Group Definitions
This group contains all broadband specific MAU related configuration objects.
Implementation of the dot3BroadMauBasicGroup is mandatory for 10BROAD36 MAUs, and is not appropriate for other types of MAUs.
3.3.  Relationship to Other MIBs
It is assumed that an agent implementing this MIB will also implement (at least)
the 'system' group defined in MIB II [4].
The following sections identify other MIBs that such an agent should implement.
Relationship to the 'system' group
the 'system' group is defined as being mandatory for all systems such that each managed entity contains one instance of each object in the 'system' group.
Thus, those objects apply to the entity even if the entity's sole functionality is management of a MAU.
Relationship to the 'interfaces' group
The sections of this document that define interface
MAU related objects specify an extension to the 'interfaces' group of MIB II [4].
An agent implementing these interface MAU related objects must also implement the 'interfaces' group of MIB II.
The value of the same as the value of 'ifIndex' used to instantiate the interface to which the given MAU is connected.
It is expected that an agent implementing the interface MAU related objects in this MIB will also implement the Ethernet like Interfaces MIB [11].
(Note that repeater ports are not represented as interfaces in the sense of MIB II's 'interfaces' group.
See section 3.4.2 of the repeater MIB [12] for more details.)
Relationship to the 802.3 Repeater MIB
The section of this document that defines repeater MAU related objects specifies an extension to the 802.3 Repeater MIB defined in [13].
An agent implementing these repeater MAU related objects must also implement the 802.3 Repeater MIB.
The values of 'rpMauGroupIndex' and 'rpMauPortIndex' used to instantiate a repeater MAU variable shall be the same as the values of 'rptrPortGroupIndex' and 'rptrPortIndex' used to instantiate the port to which the given MAU is connected.
In some situations, a MAU can be "internal"   i.e., its functionality is implemented entirely within a device.
For example, a managed repeater may contain an internal repeater  MAU and/or an internal interface MAU through which management communications originating on one of the repeater's external ports pass in order to reach the management agent associated with the repeater.
Such internal MAUs may or may not be managed.
If they are managed, objects describing their attributes should appear in the appropriate MIB group   dot3RpMauBasicGroup for internal repeater MAUs and dot3IfMauBasicGroup for internal interface MAUs.

"If the MAU is a link or fiber type (FOIRL, 10BASE T, 10BASE F) then this is equivalent to the link test fail state/low light function.
For an AUI or a coax (including broadband) MAU this indicates whether or not loopback is detected on the DI circuit.
The value of this attribute persists between packets for MAU types AUI, 10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BROAD36, and 10BASE FP.
The value other(1) is returned if the mediaAvailable state is not one of 2 through 6.
The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's true state is unknown; for example, when it is being initialized.
At power up or following a reset, the value of this attribute will be unknown for AUI, coax, and 10BASE FP MAUs.
For these MAUs loopback will be tested on each transmission during which no collision is detected.
If DI is receiving input when DO returns to IDL after a transmission and there has been no collision during the transmission then loopback will be detected.
The value of this attribute will only change during non collided transmissions for AUI, coax, and 10BASE FP MAUs.
The value available(3) indicates that the link, light, or loopback is normal.
The value notAvailable(4) indicates link loss, low light, or no loopback.
The value remoteFault(5) indicates that a fault has been detected at the remote end of the link.
The value invalidSignal(6) indicates that an invalid signal has been received from the other end of the link.
Both remoteFault(5) and invalidSignal(6) apply only to MAUs of type 10BASE FB.
