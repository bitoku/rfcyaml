- title: 1.  Introduction and History
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction and History\n   RFC 2026, and RFC 1602 before it, specified\
    \ timelines for review of\n   immature (draft or proposed) standards.  The purpose\
    \ of such review\n   was to determine whether such documents should be advanced,\
    \ retired,\n   or developed further [1].\n   This procedure has never been followed\
    \ in the history of the IETF.\n   Since this procedure has not been followed,\
    \ members of the community\n   have suggested that the retiring of a document\
    \ to Historic is a\n   significant event, which should be justified carefully\
    \ -- leading to\n   the production of documents such as RFC 2556 (OSI Connectionless\n\
    \   Transport Services on top of UDP Applicability Statement for Historic\n  \
    \  Status) and RFC 3166 (Request to Move RFC 1403 to Historic Status).\n   Such\
    \ documents require significant time and effort on the part of\n   authors, area\
    \ directors, and the RFC Editor.\n"
- title: 2.  Bulk Decommissioning Procedure
  contents:
  - "2.  Bulk Decommissioning Procedure\n   From the Fall of 2004 through the Spring\
    \ of 2005, the authors\n   conducted an experiment to determine how many Proposed\
    \ Standards\n   could be considered obsolete.  The experiment was operated as\n\
    \   follows:\n   o  Identify a group of documents that are standards.\n   o  Assume\
    \ by default that each document will be retired.\n   o  Create a mailing list\
    \ for discussion with a policy of open access.\n   o  Allow any document to be\
    \ removed from the list of those to be\n      retired for virtually any reason,\
    \ so long as a reason is provided.\n   o  Present the list to the working group,\
    \ IETF, and IESG for review.\n   o  Revise list based on comments.\n   o  Write\
    \ up results.\n   The initial intent of the authors was to present a list of documents\n\
    \   to be reclassified as Historic.  The NEWTRK working group supported\n   this\
    \ view.  The IESG, and the IETF as a community, makes the final\n   decision.\
    \  We will discuss this further below.\n"
- title: 3.  Input, Mailing list, Output, and Observations
  contents:
  - "3.  Input, Mailing list, Output, and Observations\n   We started with our initial\
    \ document set being all RFCs with numbers\n   less than 2000 and a status of\
    \ Proposed Standard.  The input we used,\n   starting November 25, 2004, can be\
    \ found in Appendix A.  There were\n   some 125 documents in all.\n   A mailing\
    \ list, old-standards@alvestrand.no, was created to discuss\n   and remove candidates\
    \ from this list.  A call for participation was\n   issued to the IETF-Announce\
    \ list on or around the November 15, 2004.\n   There were 29 members of the mailing\
    \ list.  Approximately 244\n   messages were sent to the list.  People were encouraged\
    \ to consider\n   the question of whether or not an implementer would either write\
    \ a\n   new implementation or maintain an existing one.\n   After some months\
    \ the list of documents to be considered was reduced\n   considerably.  This list\
    \ was then forwarded to the IETF discussion\n   list on December 16, 2004, and\
    \ to the NEWTRK working group list for\n   wider review.\n   During review, RFCs\
    \ 1518 and 1519 were removed, based on the fact\n   that work is ongoing to revise\
    \ them.  Similarly, RFCs 1381, 1382,\n   1471, 1472, 1473, 1582, 1598, and 1755\
    \ were removed based on the\n   belief that they were actively in use.  RFC 1584\
    \ was removed based on\n   an expected future dependency.\n   Here are the results:\n\

    \ of using this algorithm.\n"
- title: 4.  Discussion
  contents:
  - "4.  Discussion\n   As one peruses this list one sees several classes of documents:\n\
    \   o  Multiprotocol functions for protocols that are obsolete, such as\n    \
    \  Appletalk or X.400.\n   o  Protocols that were defined but not used, such as\
    \ PEM or Whois++\n   In either case above, a judgment is necessary as to whether\
    \ or not a\n   protocol is both in use and likely to be supported.  The parameters\n\
    \   of our experiment were sufficiently conservative to avoid cases where\n  \
    \ protocols were likely to continue to be supported.  That is, anyone\n   could\
    \ remove a document from the list for any reason.  In fact, in\n   some cases\
    \ we may have been too conservative.  Thus, it is also worth\n   considering the\
    \ categories of documents that were removed from the\n   list:\n   o  specifications\
    \ known to be in full use that should be considered\n      for advancement\n \
    \  o  specifications that are currently under review within the IETF\n      process\n\
    \   o  Specifications that were previously considered for deprecation and\n  \
    \    rejected.\n   The last category is exclusive to telnet options, which were\
    \ reviewed\n   in the late 1990s.  Arguably, such options should be reconsidered\
    \ for\n   deprecation.  Realistically, nobody is going to develop a new version\n\
    \   of telnet that supports the TACACS option, for instance.\n   Nevertheless,\
    \ as a first cut we were still left with 61 documents\n   that could be reclassified.\n\
    \   In at least one case, discussion of deprecation has spurred work on\n   documents.\
    \  For instance, there is a Classless Inter-Domain Routing\n   (CIDR) update in\
    \ progress.\n"
- title: 5.  Next Steps
  contents:
  - "5.  Next Steps\n   As we mention in the introduction, the current process requires\n\
    \   reconsideration of immature standards, and this review currently does\n  \
    \ not occur.  This experiment has been an attempt at a procedure that\n   could\
    \ ease that review.  The final step was working group\n   consideration of what\
    \ to do next.  There were four options:\n   1.  Accept the results of this experiment,\
    \ issue a last call, and\n       deprecate standards that remain on the list past\
    \ last call.  This\n       is an aggressive approach that would preserve the intent\
    \ of RFC\n       2026.\n   2.  Do not accept the results of this experiment and\
    \ update RFC 2026\n       to indicate a new practice.\n   3.  Revise the procedure\
    \ based on the results of this experiment,\n       based on feedback from the\
    \ IESG.  This option might take into\n       account the different types of old\
    \ standards as described above.\n   4.  Do nothing.  This would leave the IETF\
    \ and the IESG practice\n       inconsistent with documented practice.\n   The\
    \ working group chose the first option.  The RFC Editor is\n   requested to mark\
    \ the above listed standards as Historic.\n   It should be pointed out that we\
    \ only looked at proposed standards\n   and only those RFCs with numbers less\
    \ than 2000.  Should either the\n   first or third of the above options be accepted,\
    \ draft standards and\n   those older than several years should be considered.\n\
    \   Finally, should NEWTRK deliver a new document classification system,\n   these\
    \ documents may provide a basis for one or more new categories of\n   that.\n"
- title: 6.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   The IANA databases contain references to many of\
    \ these documents.\n   The documents are still the normative definitions for these\
    \ values,\n   and the IANA databases do not contain information about the status\
    \ of\n   the RFCs referred to.\n   Therefore, the IANA should not need to do anything\
    \ based on this\n   document.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Documents that have security problems may require\
    \ special attention\n   and individual documents to indicate what concerns exist,\
    \ and when or\n   in what ways an implementation can be deployed to alleviate\
    \ concerns.\n"
