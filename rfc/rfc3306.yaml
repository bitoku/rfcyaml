  - "Abstract\n   This specification defines an extension to the multicast addressing\n
    \  architecture of the IP Version 6 protocol.  The extension presented\n   in
    this document allows for unicast-prefix-based allocation of\n   multicast addresses.
    \ By delegating multicast addresses at the same\n   time as unicast prefixes,
    network operators will be able to identify\n   their multicast addresses without
    needing to run an inter-domain\n   allocation protocol.\n"

  - "1. Introduction\n   This document specifies an extension to the multicast portion
    of the\n   IPv6 addressing architecture [ADDRARCH].  The current architecture\n
    \  does not contain any built-in support for dynamic address allocation.\n   This
    proposal introduces encoded information in the multicast address\n   to allow
    for dynamic allocation of IPv6 multicast addresses and IPv6\n   source-specific
    multicast addresses.\n"
  title: 1. Introduction
- contents:
  - "2. Motivation\n   The current IPv4 multicast address allocation architecture
    [RFC 2908]\n   is based on a multi-layered, multi-protocol system.  The goal of
    this\n   proposal is to reduce the number of protocols that need to be\n   deployed
    in order to get dynamic multicast address allocation.\n   The use of unicast prefix-based
    multicast address allocation will, at\n   a minimum, remove the need to run the
    Multicast Address Allocation\n   Protocol (AAP) [AAP WORK] and the Multicast Address-Set
    Claim (MASC)\n   Protocol [RFC 2909].\n"

  title: 3. Terminology
- contents:
  - "4. Multicast Address Format\n   Section 2.7 of [ADDRARCH] defines the following
    operational format of\n   IPv6 multicast addresses:\n      |    8   |  4 |  4
    |                     112                     |\n      +--------+----+----+---------------------------------------------+\n
    \     |11111111|flgs|scop|                  group ID                   |\n      +--------+----+----+---------------------------------------------+\n
    \  This document introduces a new format that incorporates unicast\n   prefix
    information in the multicast address.  The following\n   illustrates the new format:\n
    \     |   8    |  4 |  4 |   8    |    8   |       64       |    32    |\n      +--------+----+----+--------+--------+----------------+----------+\n
    \     |11111111|flgs|scop|reserved|  plen  | network prefix | group ID |\n      +--------+----+----+--------+--------+----------------+----------+\n
    \                                  +-+-+-+-+\n   flgs is a set of 4 flags:       |0|0|P|T|\n
    \                                  +-+-+-+-+\n         o  P = 0 indicates a multicast
    address that is not assigned\n            based on the network prefix.  This indicates
    a multicast\n            address as defined in [ADDRARCH].\n         o  P = 1
    indicates a multicast address that is assigned based\n            on the network
    prefix.\n         o  If P = 1, T MUST be set to 1, otherwise the setting of the
    T\n            bit is defined in Section 2.7 of [ADDRARCH].\n   The reserved field
    MUST be zero.\n   plen indicates the actual number of bits in the network prefix
    field\n   that identify the subnet when P = 1.\n   network prefix identifies the
    network prefix of the unicast subnet\n   owning the multicast address.  If P =
    1, this field contains the\n   unicast network prefix assigned to the domain owning,
    or allocating,\n   the multicast address.  All non-significant bits of the network\n
    \  prefix field SHOULD be zero.\n   It should be noted that the Interface Identifier
    requirements in\n   Section 2.5.1 of [ADDRARCH] effectively restrict the length
    of the\n   unicast prefix to 64 bits, hence the network prefix portion of the\n
    \  multicast address will be at most 64 bits.\n   Group ID is set based on the
    guidelines outlined in [IPV6 GID].\n   The scope of the unicast-prefix based multicast
    address MUST NOT\n   exceed the scope of the unicast prefix embedded in the multicast\n
    \  address.\n"
  title: 4. Multicast Address Format
- contents:
  - "5. Address Lifetime\n   The lifetime of a unicast prefix-based multicast address
    SHOULD NOT\n   exceed the Valid Lifetime field in the Prefix Information option,\n
    \  corresponding to the unicast prefix being used, contained in the\n   Neighbor
    Discovery Router Advertisement message [RFC 2461].  The\n   lifetime of the multicast
    address is needed to support the Abstract\n   API for Multicast Address Allocation
    [RFC 2771].\n   It should be noted that the unicast prefix's Valid Lifetime in
    the\n   Router Advertisement message does not indicate that the prefix will\n
    \  become invalid at the end of the lifetime.  Rather, that value is\n   typically
    a constant until a renumbering event is scheduled after\n   which, the prefix
    does become invalid.\n   The use of unicast prefix-based multicast addresses after
    the unicast\n   prefix has become invalid may lead to operational problems.  For\n
    \  example, routers that perform policy checks comparing the multicast\n   prefix
    against the unicast prefix assigned to an AS may discard the\n   packet.\n"

  - "6. Source-Specific Multicast Addresses\n   The unicast prefix-based IPv6 multicast
    address format supports\n   Source-specific multicast addresses, as defined by
    [SSM ARCH].  To\n   accomplish this, a node MUST:\n         o  Set P = 1.\n         o
    \ Set plen = 0.\n         o  Set network prefix = 0.\n   These settings create
    an SSM range of FF3x::/32 (where 'x' is any\n   valid scope value).  The source
    address field in the IPv6 header\n   identifies the owner of the multicast address.\n"
  title: 6. Source-Specific Multicast Addresses
- contents:
  - "7. Examples\n   The following are a few examples of the structure of unicast
    prefix-\n   based multicast addresses.\n         -  Global prefixes - A network
    with a unicast prefix of\n            3FFE:FFFF:1::/48 would also have a unicast
    prefix-based\n            multicast prefix of FF3x:0030:3FFE:FFFF:0001::/96 (where
    'x'\n            is any valid scope).\n         -  SSM - All IPv6 SSM multicast
    addresses will have the format\n            FF3x::/96.\n"
  title: 7. Examples
- contents:
  - "8. Security Considerations\n   It is possible that the embedded unicast prefix
    can aid in\n   identifying the allocation domain of a given multicast address,\n
    \  though an allocation domain choosing to avoid being traced has no\n   obstacles
    currently to creating addresses using a prefix not assigned\n   to it, or using
    a smaller scope embedded prefix.\n   Using source-specific multicast addresses
    can sometimes aid in the\n   prevention of denial-of-service attacks by arbitrary
    sources,\n   although no guarantee is provided.  A more in-depth discussion of
    the\n   security considerations for SSM can be found in [SSM ARCH].\n"
