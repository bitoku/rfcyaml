- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   In IPv6, optional internet-layer information is encoded in separate\n\
    \   headers that may be placed between the IPv6 header and the transport-\n  \
    \ layer header.  There are a small number of such extension headers\n   currently\
    \ defined.  This document describes the issues that can arise\n   when defining\
    \ new extension headers and discusses the alternate\n   extension mechanisms in\
    \ IPv6.  It also provides a common format for\n   defining any new IPv6 extension\
    \ headers, if they are needed.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The base IPv6 standard [RFC2460] defines extension headers\
    \ as an\n   expansion mechanism to carry optional internet-layer information.\n\
    \   Extension headers, with the exception of the Hop-by-Hop Options\n   header,\
    \ are not usually processed on intermediate nodes.  However,\n   several existing\
    \ deployed IPv6 routers and several existing deployed\n   IPv6 firewalls, in contradiction\
    \ to [RFC2460], are capable of parsing\n   past or ignoring all currently defined\
    \ IPv6 extension headers (e.g.,\n   to examine transport-layer header fields)\
    \ at wire speed (e.g., by\n   using custom Application-specific Integrated Circuits\
    \ (ASICs) for\n   packet processing).  Hence, one must also consider that any\
    \ new IPv6\n   extension header will break IPv6 deployments that use these existing\n\
    \   capabilities.\n   Any IPv6 header or option that has hop-by-hop behavior,\
    \ and is\n   intended for general use in the public IPv6 Internet, could be\n\
    \   subverted to create an attack on IPv6 routers that process packets\n   containing\
    \ such a header or option.  Reports from the field indicate\n   that some IP routers\
    \ deployed within the global Internet are\n   configured either to ignore the\
    \ presence of headers with hop-by-hop\n   behavior or to drop packets containing\
    \ headers with hop-by-hop\n   behavior.\n"

- title: 3.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "3.  Applicability\n   The base IPv6 standard [RFC2460] allows the use of both\
    \ extension\n   headers and destination options in order to encode optional\n\
    \   destination information in an IPv6 packet.  The use of destination\n   options\
    \ to encode this information provides more flexible handling\n   characteristics\
    \ and better backward compatibility than using\n   extension headers.  Because\
    \ of this, implementations SHOULD use\n   destination options as the preferred\
    \ mechanism for encoding optional\n   destination information, and use a new extension\
    \ header only if\n   destination options do not satisfy their needs.  The request\
    \ for\n   creation of a new IPv6 extension header MUST be accompanied by a\n \
    \  specific explanation of why destination options could not be used to\n   convey\
    \ this information.\n   The base IPv6 standard [RFC2460] defines 3 extension headers\
    \ (i.e.,\n   Routing header, Destination Options header, Hop-by-Hop Options\n\
    \   header) to be used for any new IPv6 options.  The same standard only\n   allows\
    \ the creation of new extension headers in limited circumstances\n   ([RFC2460],\
    \ Section 4.6).\n   As noted above, the use of any option with hop-by-hop behavior\
    \ can be\n   problematic in the global public Internet.  New IPv6 extension\n\
    \   header(s) having hop-by-hop behavior MUST NOT be created or\n   specified.\
    \  New options for the existing Hop-by-Hop Header SHOULD NOT\n   be created or\
    \ specified unless no alternative solution is feasible.\n   Any proposal to create\
    \ a new option for the existing Hop-by-Hop\n   Header MUST include a detailed\
    \ explanation of why the hop-by-hop\n   behavior is absolutely essential in the\
    \ document proposing the new\n   option with hop-by-hop behavior.\n   The use\
    \ of IPv6 Destination Options to encode information provides\n   more flexible\
    \ handling characteristics and better backward\n   compatibility than using a\
    \ new extension header.  Because of this,\n   new optional information to be sent\
    \ SHOULD be encoded in a new option\n   for the existing IPv6 Destination Options\
    \ header.\n   Mindful of the need for compatibility with existing IPv6 deployments,\n\
    \   new IPv6 extension headers MUST NOT be created or specified, unless\n   no\
    \ existing IPv6 extension header can be used by specifying a new\n   option for\
    \ that existing IPv6 extension header.  Any proposal to\n   create or specify\
    \ a new IPv6 extension header MUST include a detailed\n   technical explanation\
    \ of why no existing IPv6 extension header can be\n   used in the document proposing\
    \ the new IPv6 extension header.\n"

    \ this area.\n   Some issues that are left unresolved beyond this document include:\n\
    \   o  There can be an arbitrary number of extension headers.\n   o  Extension\
    \ headers must be processed in the order they appear.\n   o  Extension headers\
    \ may alter the processing of the payload itself,\n      and hence the packet\
    \ may not be processed properly without\n      knowledge of said header.\n"

    \ that inspect\n   but do not understand the contents of these headers.  Intermediate\n\
    \   nodes, such as firewalls, that skip over unknown headers might end up\n  \
    \ allowing the setup of a covert channel from the outside of the\n   firewall\
    \ to the inside using the data field(s) of the unknown\n   extension headers.\n"
