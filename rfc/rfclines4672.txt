Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.

This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)
Dynamic Authorization Client (DAC) functions that support the dynamic authorization extensions as defined in RFC 3576.
It is becoming increasingly important to support Dynamic Authorization extensions on the network access server (NAS) devices to handle the Disconnect and Change of Authorization (CoA) messages, as described in [RFC3576].
As a result, the effective management of RADIUS Dynamic Authorization entities is of considerable importance.
This RADIUS Dynamic Authorization Client MIB complements the managed objects used for managing RADIUS authentication and accounting servers, as described in [RFC4669] and [RFC4671], respectively.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
Terminology Dynamic Authorization Server (DAS)
The component that resides on the NAS that processes the Disconnect and Change of Authorization (CoA)
RFC3576] sent by the Dynamic Authorization Client.
The component that sends Disconnect and CoA Request packets to the Dynamic Authorization Server.
Although this component often resides on the RADIUS server, it is also possible for this component to be located on a separate host, such as a Rating Engine.
The UDP port on which the Dynamic Authorization Server listens for the Disconnect and CoA requests sent by the Dynamic Authorization Client.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579], and
Overview "Dynamic Authorization Extensions to RADIUS" [RFC3576] defines the operation of Disconnect Request, Disconnect ACK, Disconnect NAK, CoA Request, CoA ACK, and CoA NAK packets.
[RFC4673] defines the Dynamic Authorization Server MIB and the relationship with other MIB modules.
This MIB module for the Dynamic Authorization Client contains the following: 1.
One Dynamic Authorization Server table.
This table contains one row for each DAS with which the DAC shares a secret.

radiusDynAuthClientCounterDiscontinuity } STATUS  current DESCRIPTION
"The collection of objects supporting the RADIUS messages including Service Type attribute with value 'Authorize Only'."
There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
So, if this MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB module via direct SNMP SET operations.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
These can be used to determine the address of the DAS with which the DAC is communicating.
This information could be useful in mounting an attack on the DAS.
This can be used to determine the Identifier of the DAS.
This information could be useful in impersonating the DAS.
This can be used to determine the destination port number to which the DAC is sending.
This information could be useful in mounting an attack on the DAS.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
The IANA has assigned OID number 145 under mib 2.
