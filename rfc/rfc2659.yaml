- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This memo describes a syntax for embedding S-HTTP negotiation\n\
    \   parameters in HTML documents.  S-HTTP, as described by RFC 2660,\n   contains\
    \ the concept of negotiation headers which reflect the\n   potential receiver\
    \ of a message's preferences as to which crypto-\n   graphic enhancements should\
    \ be applied to the message. This document\n   describes a syntax for binding\
    \ these negotiation parameters to HTML\n   anchors.\n   1.  Introduction\n   2.\
    \  Anchor Attributes\n   We define the following new anchor (and form submission)\
    \ attributes:\n        DN -- The distinguished name of the principal for whom\
    \ the\n        request should be encrypted when dereferencing the anchor's url.\n\
    \        This need not be specified, but failure to do so runs the risk\n    \
    \    that the client will be unable to determine the DN and therefore\n      \
    \  will be unable to encrypt.  This should be specified in the form\n        of\
    \ RFC1485, using SGML quoting conventions as needed.\n        NONCE -- A free-format\
    \ string (appropriately SGML quoted) which\n        is to be included in a SHTTP-Nonce:\
    \ header (after SGML quoting\n        is removed) when the anchor is dereferenced.\n\
    \        CRYPTOPTS -- Cryptographic option information as described in\n     \
    \   [SHTTP]. Specifically, the <cryptopt-list> production.\n"
- title: 2.1.  CERTS Element
  contents:
  - "2.1.  CERTS Element\n   A new CERTS HTML element is defined, which carries a\
    \ (not necessarily\n   related) group of certificates provided as advisory data.\
    \ The element\n   contents are not intended to be displayed to the user. Certificate\n\
    \   groups may be provided appropriate for either PEM or PKCS-7\n   implementations.\
    \ Such certificates are supplied in the HTML document\n   for the convenience\
    \ of the recipient, who might otherwise be unable\n   to retrieve the certificate\
    \ (chain) corresponding to a DN specified\n   in an anchor.\n   The format should\
    \ be the same as that of the 'Certificate-Info'\n   header line, of [SHTTP] except\
    \ that the <Cert-Fmt> specifier should\n   be provided as the FMT attribute in\
    \ the tag.\n   Multiple CERTS elements are permitted; it is suggested that CERTS\n\
    \   elements themselves be included in the HTML document's HEAD element\n   (in\
    \ the hope that the data will not be displayed by S-HTTP oblivious\n   but HTML\
    \ compliant browsers.)\n"
- title: 2.2.  CRYPTOPTS Element
  contents:
  - "2.2.  CRYPTOPTS Element\n   Cryptopts may also be broken out into an element\
    \ and referred to in\n   anchors by name. The NAME attribute specifies the name\
    \ by which this\n   element may be referred to in a CRYPTOPTS attribute in an\
    \ anchor.\n   Names must have a # as the leading character.\n"
