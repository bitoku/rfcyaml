  - "Abstract\n   The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation\n \
    \  functions in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label\n   Switching\
    \ (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.\n   Extensions to the MPLS and\
    \ GMPLS signaling and routing protocols have\n   been made in support of point-to-multipoint\
    \ (P2MP) Traffic Engineered\n   (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  The use of\
    \ PCE in MPLS networks is\n   already established, and since P2MP TE LSP routes\
    \ are sometimes\n   complex to compute, it is likely that PCE will be used for\
    \ P2MP LSPs.\n   Generic requirements for a communication protocol between Path\n\
    \   Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs are presented in RFC 4657, \"Path\n  \

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in [RFC4655]\
    \ is an entity\n   that is capable of computing a network path or route based\
    \ on a\n   network graph, and applying computational constraints.  The intention\n\
    \   is that the PCE is used to compute the path of Traffic Engineered\n   Label\
    \ Switched Paths (TE LSPs) within Multiprotocol Label Switching\n   (MPLS) and\
    \ Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.\n   Requirements for point-to-multipoint\
    \ (P2MP) MPLS TE LSPs are\n   documented in [RFC4461], and signaling protocol\
    \ extensions for\n   setting up P2MP MPLS TE LSPs are defined in [RFC4875].  P2MP\
    \ MPLS TE\n   networks are considered in support of various features, including\n\
    \   layer 3 multicast virtual private networks [RFC4834].\n   Path computation\
    \ for P2MP TE LSPs presents a significant challenge,\n   and network optimization\
    \ of multiple P2MP TE LSPs requires\n   considerable computational resources.\
    \  PCE offers a way to offload\n   such path computations from Label Switching\
    \ Routers (LSRs).\n   The applicability of the PCE-based path computation architecture\
    \ to\n   P2MP MPLS TE is described in a companion document [RFC5671].  No\n  \
    \ further attempt is made to justify the use of PCE for P2MP MPLS TE\n   within\
    \ this document.\n   This document presents a set of PCC-PCE communication protocol\n\
    \   (PCECP) requirements for P2MP MPLS traffic engineering.  It\n   supplements\
    \ the generic requirements documented in [RFC4657].\n"

- title: 3.1.10.  Reoptimization of P2MP TE LSPs
  contents:
  - "3.1.10.  Reoptimization of P2MP TE LSPs\n   R11: Reoptimization MUST be supported\
    \ for P2MP TE LSPs as described\n        for P2P LSPs in [RFC4657].  To support\
    \ this, the existing path\n        MUST be supplied as described in Section 3.1.9.\n\
    \        Because P2MP LSPs are more complex, it is often the case that\n     \
    \   small optimization improvements can be made after changes in\n        network\
    \ resource availability.  However, re-signaling any LSP\n        introduces risks\
    \ to the stability of the service provided to the\n        customer and the stability\
    \ of the network, even when techniques\n        like make-before-break [RFC3209]\
    \ are used.  Therefore, a P2MP\n        Path Computation Request SHOULD contain\
    \ a parameter that allows\n        the PCC to express a cost-benefit reoptimization\
    \ threshold for\n        the whole LSP, as well as per destination.  The setting\
    \ of this\n        parameter is subject to local policy at the PCC and SHOULD\
    \ be\n        subject to policy at the PCE [RFC5394].\n        Path reoptimization\

- title: 3.1.11.  Addition and Removal of Destinations from Existing Paths
  contents:
  - "3.1.11.  Addition and Removal of Destinations from Existing Paths\n   A variation\
    \ of path modification described in Section 3.1.9 is that\n   destinations may\
    \ be added to, or removed from, existing P2MP TE LSPs.\n   In the case of the\
    \ addition of one or more destinations, it is\n   necessary to compute a path\
    \ for a new branch of the P2MP LSP.  It may\n   be desirable to recompute the\
    \ whole P2MP tree, to add the new branch\n   as a simple spur from the existing\
    \ tree, or to recompute part of the\n   P2MP tree.\n   R12: To support this function\
    \ for leaf additions, it MUST be possible\n        to make the following indications\
    \ in a Path Computation Request:\n        - The path of an existing P2MP LSP (as\
    \ described in\n          Section 3.1.9).\n        - Which destinations are new\
    \ additions to the tree.\n        - Which destinations of the existing tree must\
    \ not have their\n          paths modified.\n        It MAY also be possible to\
    \ indicate in a Path Computation\n        Request a cost-benefit reoptimization\
    \ threshold, such that the\n        addition of new leaves will not cause reoptimization\
    \ of the\n        existing P2MP tree unless a certain improvement is made over\n\
    \        simply grafting the new leaves to the existing tree.  (Compare\n    \
    \    with Section 3.1.10.)\n        In the case of the deletion of one or more\
    \ destinations, it is\n        not necessary to compute a new path for the P2MP\
    \ TE LSP, but\n        such a computation may yield optimizations over a simple\
    \ pruning\n        of the tree.  The recomputation function in this case is\n\
    \        essentially the same as that described in Section 3.1.10, but\n     \
    \   note that it MAY be possible to supply the full previous path of\n       \
    \ the entire P2MP TE LSP (that is, before the deletion of the\n        destinations)\
    \ in the Path Computation Request.\n        For both addition and deletion of\
    \ destinations, the Path\n        Computation Response SHOULD indicate which of\

    \ from the\n        paths supplied in the Path Computation Request, as described\
    \ in\n        Section 3.1.10.\n        Note that the selection of all of these\
