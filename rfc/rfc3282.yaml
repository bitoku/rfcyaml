  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a \"Content-language:\" header, for use in\
    \ cases\n   where one desires to indicate the language of something that has RFC\n\
    \   822-like headers, like MIME body parts or Web documents, and an\n   \"Accept-Language:\"\
    \ header for use in cases where one wishes to\n   indicate one's preferences with\
    \ regard to language.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   There are a number of languages presently or previously used\
    \ by human\n   beings in this world.\n   A great number of these people would\
    \ prefer to have information\n   presented in a language which they understand.\n\
    \   In some contexts, it is possible to have information available in\n   more\
    \ than one language, or it might be possible to provide tools\n   (such as dictionaries)\
    \ to assist in the understanding of a language.\n   In other cases, it may be\
    \ desirable to use a computer program to\n   convert information from one format\
    \ (such as plaintext) into another\n   (such as computer-synthesized speech, or\
    \ Braille, or high-quality\n   print renderings).\n   A prerequisite for any such\
    \ function is a means of labelling the\n   information content with an identifier\
    \ for the language that is used\n   in this information content, such as is defined\
    \ by [TAGS].  This\n   document specifies a protocol element for use with protocols\
    \ that use\n   RFC 822-like headers for carrying language tags as defined in [TAGS].\n\
    \   The keywords \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\"\
    ,\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in\
    \ this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].\n"
- title: 2. The Content-language header
  contents:
  - "2. The Content-language header\n   The \"Content-Language\" header is intended\
    \ for use in the case where\n   one desires to indicate the language(s) of something\
    \ that has RFC\n   822-like headers, such as MIME body parts or Web documents.\n\
    \   The RFC 822 EBNF of the Content-Language header is:\n      Content-Language\
    \ = \"Content-Language\" \":\" 1#Language-tag\n   In the more strict RFC 2234\
    \ ABNF:\n      Content-Language = \"Content-Language\" \":\" [CFWS] Language-List\n\
    \      Language-List = Language-Tag [CFWS]\n                         *(\",\" [CFWS]\
    \ Language-Tag [CFWS])\n   The Content-Language header may list several languages\
    \ in a comma-\n   separated list.\n   The CFWS construct is intended to function\
    \ like the whitespace\n   convention in RFC 822, which means also that one can\
    \ place\n   parenthesized comments anywhere in the language sequence, or use\n\
    \   continuation lines.  A formal definition is given in RFC 2822\n   [RFC2822].\n\
    \   In keeping with the tradition of RFC 2822, a more liberal \"obsolete\"\n \
    \  grammar is also given:\n      obs-content-language = \"Content-Language\" *WSP\
    \ \":\"\n                              [CFWS] Language-List\n   Like RFC 2822,\
    \ this specification says that conforming\n   implementations MUST accept the\
    \ obs-content-language syntax, but MUST\n   NOT generate it; all generated headers\
    \ MUST conform to the Content-\n   Language syntax.\n"

- title: 3. The Accept-Language header
  contents:
  - "3. The Accept-Language header\n   The \"Accept-Language\" header is intended\
    \ for use in cases where a\n   user or a process desires to identify the preferred\
    \ language(s) when\n   RFC 822-like headers, such as MIME body parts or Web documents,\
    \ are\n   used.\n   The RFC 822 EBNF of the Accept-Language header is:\n     \
    \ Accept-Language = \"Accept-Language\" \":\"\n                             1#(\
    \ language-range [ \";\" \"q\" \"=\" qvalue ] )\n   A slightly more restrictive\
    \ RFC 2234 ABNF definition is:\n      Accept-Language = \"Accept-Language:\" [CFWS]\
    \ language-q\n                        *( \",\" [CFWS] language-q )\n      language-q\

    0\") ] )\n   A more liberal RFC 2234 ABNF definition is:\n      Obs-accept-language\

    \        [ [CFWS] \";\" [CFWS] \"q\" [CFWS] \"=\" qvalue ]\n   Like RFC 2822,\
    \ this specification says that conforming\n   implementations MUST accept the\
    \ obs-accept-language syntax, but MUST\n   NOT generate it; all generated messages\
    \ MUST conform to the Accept-\n   Language syntax.\n   The syntax and semantics\
    \ of language-range is defined in [TAGS].  The\n   Accept-Language header may\
    \ list several language-ranges in a comma-\n   separated list, and each may include\
    \ a quality value Q.  If no Q\n   values are given, the language-ranges are given\
    \ in priority order,\n   with the leftmost language-range being the most preferred\
    \ language;\n   this is an extension to the HTTP/1.1 rules, but matches current\n\
    \   practice.\n   If Q values are given, refer to HTTP/1.1 [RFC 2616] for the\
    \ details\n   on how to evaluate it.\n"
- title: 4. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Security Considerations\n   The only security issue that has been raised with\
    \ language tags since\n   the publication of RFC 1766, which stated that \"Security\
    \ issues are\n   believed to be irrelevant to this memo\", is a concern with language\n\
    \   ranges used in content negotiation - that they may be used to infer\n   the\
    \ nationality of the sender, and thus identify potential targets\n   for surveillance.\n\
    \   This is a special case of the general problem that anything you send\n   is\
    \ visible to the receiving party; it is useful to be aware that such\n   concerns\
    \ can exist in some cases.\n   The exact magnitude of the threat, and any possible\
    \ countermeasures,\n   is left to each application protocol.\n"
