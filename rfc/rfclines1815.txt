Abstract Though the ISO character set standard of ISO 10646 is specified reasonably well about European characters, it is not so useful in an fully internationalized environment.
For the practical use of ISO 10646, a lot of external profiling such as restriction of characters, restriction of combination of characters and addition of language information is necessary.
This memo provides information on such profiling, along with charset names to each profiled instance.
Though all the effort is done to make the resulting charset as useful 10646 based charset as possible, the result is not so good.
So, the charsets defined in this memo are only for reference purpose and its use for practical purpose is strongly discouraged.
This memo describes two text encoding schemes based on ISO 10646 [10646].
As ISO 10646 specifies too little about how text is visualized, to practically use ISO 10646, it is necessary to restrict the standard minimally and then add some amount of profiling information.
For ISO 2022 [ISO2022] based national standards, sufficient profiling information is provided by national standardization bodies, but, for ISO 10646, such a profiling is not yet provided.
As the profiling of ISO 10646 largely affects which character or combination of characters could be properly displayed, changes of profiling of ISO 10646 are as significant as additions of new character sets of ISO 2022.
That is, it's impractical to support the entirety of ISO 10646 (new restriction or profiling can always be added), so a client needs to know whether some restriction or profiling is being used before it can decide whether to display the body part.
Thus, it is necessary to provide multiple charset names to each variation of ISO 10646.
For example, in Japan with Japanese windows NT, only those Han characters already supported by MS Kanji code (mostly equivalent to JIS X 0208
[JISX0208]) can be displayed, because no other font pattern is commonly provided.
The other problem of ISO 10646 for Han characters is that, to display them in quality required for daily plain text processing in China/Japan/Korea, it is necessary to add profiling information on which one of Chinese/Japanese/Korean the text is using.
It should be noted that this feature makes multilingual mixed Chinese/Japanese/Korean text with ISO 10646 impractical.
Also, just as [RFC1521] was unclear about how bi directionality should be supported with "ISO 8859 6" and "ISO 8859 8" which was corrected by [RFC1556], it is also unclear how bi directionality could be supported with ISO 10646.
There are too much ways to support bi  directionality.
So, until some bi directionality mechanism(s) becomes widely supported, it is necessary to exclude characters for languages which requires bi directionality support from the minimal variation.
It should be noted that, though ISO 10646 is intended to be free from long term states, save for some profiling information, introduction of bi directionality with ISO 10646 do requires the long term states.
Combining characters also cause problems.
In many countries where combining characters based on [ISO2022] is used, there are restrictions on how combining characters are ordered [TIS].
Without such restriction, the result of combination is completely meaningless which is the current state of ISO 10646.
That is, if some combination is allowed in some implementation while the other does not support it, communication between them is difficult unless ISO 10646 is profiled to be least common set of widely supported combinations.
So, again, until combination restriction will be developed for each language, it is necessary to exclude characters for such languages from the minimal variation.
Conjoining characters also, may or may not be supported, which requires another profiling.
According to those considerations, this memo defines two variations of ISO 10646.
They are "ISO 10646" as the minimal basic variation and "ISO 10646 J 1" as the variation which could be useful in Japan.
Finally, this memo, by no means, promotes the use of ISO 10646 on the Internet.
It's use is strongly discouraged, when there are other charsets which can encode the same information, Families of ISO 10646 based charsets, like ISO 2022
based charsets, only forms set of mutually incompatible encoding systems and, unlike ISO 2022 based charsets [2022INT], they can not be merged together to be the single world wide charset.
00A0 00FF C0 and C1 control characters may also be used as specified in the section 16 of ISO 10646.
The text with "ISO 10646" encodes text in 16 bit big endian form.
As no combining characters are included, "ISO 10646" can be used with applications at implementation level 1.
Left to right directionality should be used.
The encoding is implemented by Windows/NT.
For practical communication, use of "ISO 10646" is discouraged.
ISO 8859 1" [RFC1345] should be used instead.
Description of "ISO 10646 J 1" ISO 10646 J 1 is profiled to be useful for Japanese PC users who use Japanese version of Windows/NT and contains the following graphic characters:
2200 22FF  See note 1, below.
2500 257F 49 CJK SYMBOLS AND PUNCTUATION
Most of the characters are excluded.
That is, only those characters of JIS X 0208
The reason is that the Japanese version of Windows/NT have fonts for them only and most of the users can not read messages which contains other characters.
C0 and C1 control characters may also be used as specified in the section 16 of ISO 10646.
The text with "ISO 10646 J 1" encodes text in 16 bit big endian form.
Shapes of Han characters should be of Japanese Han, that is, those of column "J" in section 26 of ISO 10646.
As no combining characters are included, "ISO 10646 J 1" can be used with applications at implementation level 1.
Characters in "HALFWIDTH AND FULLWIDTH FORMS" compared to be different characters to the normal width characters.
When text is displayed horizontally, left to right directionality should be used.
For practical communication, use of "ISO 10646 J 1" is discouraged.
ISO 2022 JP" [2022JP] should be used instead.
The names given to the character encoding methods described in this memo are, respectively, "ISO 10646" and "ISO 10646 J 1".
This name is intended to be used in MIME messages as follows:
Content Type: text/plain; charset iso 10646
The ISO 10646 and ISO 10646 J 1 encoding are in 16 bit form, so it is often necessary to use a Content Transfer Encoding header.
The ISO 10646 and ISO 10646 J 1 may also be used in MIME Part 2 headers [RFC1522].
The "B" encoding should be used with them.
Security Considerations Security issues are not discussed in this memo.
