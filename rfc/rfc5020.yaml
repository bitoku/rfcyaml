  - "Abstract\n   This document describes the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n
    \  (LDAP) / X.500 'entryDN' operational attribute.  The attribute\n   provides
    a copy of the entry's distinguished name for use in\n   attribute value assertions.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Background and Intended Use\n   In X.500 Directory Services [X.501], such
    as those accessible using\n   the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
    [RFC4510], an entry\n   is identified by its distinguished name (DN) [RFC4512].
    \ However, as\n   an entry's DN is not an attribute of the entry, it is not possible
    to\n   perform attribute value assertions [RFC4511] against it.\n   This document
    describes the 'entryDN' operational attribute which\n   holds a copy of the entry's
    distinguished name.  This attribute may\n   be used in search filters.  For instance,
    searching the subtree\n   <dc=example,dc=com> with the filter:\n      (entryDN:componentFilterMatch:=or:{\n
    \         item:{ component \"3\", rule rdnMatch, value \"ou=A\" },\n          item:{
    component \"3\", rule rdnMatch, value \"ou=B\" } })\n   would return entries in
    the subtree <ou=A,dc=example,dc=com> and\n   entries in subtree <ou=B,dc=example,dc=com>,
    but would not return any\n   other entries in the subtree <dc=example,dc=com>.\n
    \  In the above paragraph, DNs are presented using the string\n   representation
    defined in [RFC4514], and the example search filter is\n   presented using the
    string representation defined in [RFC4515] with\n   whitespace (line breaks and
    indentation) added to improve\n   readability.  The 'componentFilterMatch' and
    'rdnMatch' rules are\n   specified in [RFC3687].\n   Schema definitions are provided
    using LDAP description formats\n   [RFC4512].  Definitions provided here are formatted
    (line wrapped)\n   for readability.\n"

  - "2.  'entryDN' Operational Attribute\n   The 'entryDN' operational attribute provides
    a copy of the entry's\n   current DN.\n   The following is an LDAP attribute type
    description suitable for\n   publication in subschema subentries.\n      ( 1.3.6.1.1.20

    be modified through this\n   attribute.\n"

    mechanism to access an\n   entry's DN, the introduction of this attribute is not
    believed to\n   introduce new security considerations.\n"
