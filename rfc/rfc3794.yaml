  - "Abstract\n   This document seeks to document all usage of IPv4 addresses in\n\
    \   currently deployed IETF Transport Area documented standards.  In\n   order\
    \ to successfully transition from an all IPv4 Internet to an all\n   IPv6 Internet,\
    \ many interim steps will be taken.  One of these steps\n   is the evolution of\
    \ current protocols that have IPv4 dependencies.\n   It is hoped that these protocols\
    \ (and their implementations) will be\n   redesigned to be network address independent,\
    \ but failing that will\n   at least dually support IPv4 and IPv6.  To this end,\
    \ all Standards\n   (Full, Draft, and Proposed) as well as Experimental RFCs will\
    \ be\n   surveyed and any dependencies will be documented.\n"

- title: 1.0.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.0.  Introduction\n   This document is part of a document set aiming to document\
    \ all usage\n   of IPv4 addresses in IETF standards.  In an effort to have the\n\
    \   information in a manageable form, it has been broken into 7 documents\n  \
    \ conforming to the current IETF areas (Application,  Internet,\n   Operations\
    \ & Management, Routing, Security, Sub-IP and Transport).\n   For a full introduction,\
    \ please see the introduction [1].\n"
- title: 2.0.  Document Organization
  contents:
  - "2.0.  Document Organization\n   The rest of the document sections are described\
    \ below.\n   Sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 each describe the raw analysis of Full,\n\
    \   Draft, and Proposed Standards, and Experimental RFCs.  Each RFC is\n   discussed\
    \ in its turn starting with RFC 1 and ending with (around)\n   RFC 3100. The comments\
    \ for each RFC are \"raw\" in nature.  That is,\n   each RFC is discussed in a\
    \ vacuum and problems or issues discussed do\n   not \"look ahead\" to see if\
    \ the problems have already been fixed.\n   Section 7 is an analysis of the data\
    \ presented in Sections 3, 4, 5,\n   and 6.  It is here that all of the results\
    \ are considered as a whole\n   and the problems that have been resolved in later\
    \ RFCs are\n   correlated.\n"
- title: 3.0.  Full Standards
  contents:
  - "3.0.  Full Standards\n   Full Internet Standards (most commonly simply referred\
    \ to as\n   \"Standards\") are fully mature protocol specification that are widely\n\
    \   implemented and used throughout the Internet.\n"
- title: 3.1.  RFC 768 User Datagram Protocol
  contents:
  - "3.1.  RFC 768 User Datagram Protocol\n   Although UDP is a transport protocol\
    \ there is one reference to the\n   UDP/IP interface that states;  \"The UDP module\
    \ must be able to\n   determine the source and destination internet addresses\
    \ and the\n   protocol field from the internet header.\"  This does not force\
    \ a\n   rewrite of the protocol but will clearly cause changes in\n   implementations.\n"
- title: 3.2.  RFC 793 Transmission Control Protocol
  contents:
  - "3.2.  RFC 793 Transmission Control Protocol\n   Section 3.1 which specifies the\
    \ header format for TCP.  The TCP\n   header is free from IPv4 references but\
    \ there is an inconsistency in\n   the computation of checksums.  The text says:\
    \  \"The checksum also\n   covers a 96 bit pseudo header conceptually prefixed\
    \ to the TCP\n   header.  This pseudo header contains the Source Address, the\n\
    \   Destination Address, the Protocol, and TCP length.\"  The first and\n   second\
    \ 32-bit words are clearly meant to specify 32-bit IPv4\n   addresses.  While\
    \ no modification of the TCP protocol is necessitated\n   by this problem, an\
    \ alternate needs to be specified as an update\n   document, or as part of another\
    \ IPv6 document.\n"

    \ STANDARD FOR A NetBIOS SERVICE ON A\n            TCP/UDP TRANSPORT: CONCEPTS\
    \ AND METHODS\n      Section 15.4.1.  RELEASE BY B NODES defines:\n         A\
    \ NAME RELEASE DEMAND contains the following information:\n           -  NetBIOS\

    \ unique or group\n           -  IP address of the releasing node\n          \
    \ -  Transaction ID\n      Section 15.4.2.  RELEASE BY P NODES defines:\n    \
    \     A NAME RELEASE REQUEST contains the following information:\n           -\
    \  NetBIOS name\n           -  The scope of the NetBIOS name\n           -  Name\
    \ type: unique or group\n           -  IP address of the releasing node\n    \
    \       -  Transaction ID\n         A NAME RELEASE RESPONSE contains the following\
    \ information:\n           -  NetBIOS name\n           -  The scope of the NetBIOS\
    \ name\n           -  Name type: unique or group\n           -  IP address of\
    \ the releasing node\n           -  Transaction ID\n           -  Result:\n  \
    \              -  Yes: name was released\n                -  No: name was not\
    \ released, a reason code is provided\n      Section 16.  NetBIOS SESSION SERVICE\
    \ states:\n         The NetBIOS session service begins after one or more IP\n\
    \         addresses have been found for the target name.  These addresses\n  \
    \       may have been acquired using the NetBIOS name query\n         transactions\
    \ or by other means, such as a local name table or\n         cache.\n      Section\
    \ 16.1.  OVERVIEW OF NetBIOS SESSION SERVICE\n         Session service has three\
    \ phases:\n         Session establishment - it is during this phase that the IP\n\
    \            address and TCP port of the called name is determined, and a\n  \
    \          TCP connection is established with the remote party.\n      6.1.1.\
    \  SESSION ESTABLISHMENT PHASE OVERVIEW\n         An end-node begins establishment\
    \ of a session to another node\n         by somehow acquiring (perhaps using the\
    \ name query transactions\n         or a local cache) the IP address of the node\
    \ or nodes purported\n         to own the destination name.\n         Once the\
    \ TCP connection is open, the calling node sends session\n         service request\
    \ packet.  This packet contains the following\n         information:\n       \
    \    -  Calling IP address (see note)\n           -  Calling NetBIOS name\n  \
    \         -  Called IP address (see note)\n           -  Called NetBIOS name\n\
    \         NOTE: The IP addresses are obtained from the TCP service\n         \
    \      interface.\n         If a compatible LISTEN exists, and there are adequate\n\
    \         resources, then the session server may transform the existing\n    \
    \     TCP connection into the NetBIOS data session.  Alternatively,\n        \
    \ the session server may redirect, or \"retarget\" the caller to\n         another\
    \ TCP port (and IP address).\n         If the caller is redirected, the caller\
    \ begins the session\n         establishment anew, but using the new IP address\
    \ and TCP port\n         given in the retarget response.  Again a TCP connection\
    \ is\n         created, and again the calling and called node exchange\n     \
    \    credentials.  The called party may accept the call, reject the\n        \
    \ call, or make a further redirection.\n      17.1.  OVERVIEW OF NetBIOS DATAGRAM\
    \ SERVICE\n         Every NetBIOS datagram has a named destination and source.\
    \  To\n         transmit a NetBIOS datagram, the datagram service must perform\n\
    \         a name query operation to learn the IP address and the\n         attributes\
    \ of the destination NetBIOS name.  (This information\n         may be cached\
    \ to avoid the overhead of name query on subsequent\n         NetBIOS datagrams.)\n\
    \      17.1.1.  UNICAST, MULTICAST, AND BROADCAST\n         NetBIOS datagrams\
    \ may be unicast, multicast, or broadcast.  A\n         NetBIOS datagram addressed\
    \ to a unique NetBIOS name is unicast.\n         A NetBIOS datagram addressed\
    \ to a group NetBIOS name, whether\n         there are zero, one, or more actual\
    \ members, is multicast.  A\n         NetBIOS datagram sent using the NetBIOS\
    \ \"Send Broadcast\n         Datagram\" primitive is broadcast.\n      17.1.2.\
    \  FRAGMENTATION OF NetBIOS DATAGRAMS\n         When the header and data of a\
    \ NetBIOS datagram exceeds the\n         maximum amount of data allowed in a UDP\
    \ packet, the NetBIOS\n         datagram must be fragmented before transmission\
    \ and reassembled\n         upon receipt.\n         A NetBIOS Datagram is composed\
    \ of the following protocol\n         elements:\n           -  IP header of 20\
    \ bytes (minimum)\n           -  UDP header of 8 bytes\n           -  NetBIOS\
    \ Datagram Header of 14 bytes\n           -  The NetBIOS Datagram data.\n    \
    \  18.  NODE CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n         -  B NODES:\n              - \
    \ Node's permanent unique name\n              -  Whether IGMP is in use\n    \
    \          -  Broadcast IP address to use\n              -  Whether NetBIOS session\
    \ keep-alives are needed\n              -  Usable UDP data field length (to control\
    \ fragmentation)\n         -  P NODES:\n              -  Node's permanent unique\
    \ name\n              -  IP address of NBNS\n              -  IP address of NBDD\n\
    \              -  Whether NetBIOS session keep-alives are needed\n           \
    \   -  Usable UDP data field length (to control fragmentation)\n         -  M\
    \ NODES:\n              -  Node's permanent unique name\n              -  Whether\
    \ IGMP is in use\n              -  Broadcast IP address to use\n             \
    \ -  IP address of NBNS\n              -  IP address of NBDD\n              -\
    \  Whether NetBIOS session keep-alives are needed\n              -  Usable UDP\
    \ data field length (to control fragmentation)\n   All of the proceeding sections\

  - "5.0.  Proposed Standards\n   Proposed Standards are introductory level documents.\
    \  There are no\n   requirements for even a single implementation.  In many cases\n\
    \   Proposed are never implemented or advanced in the IETF standards\n   process.\
    \  They therefore are often just proposed ideas that are\n   presented to the\
    \ Internet community.  Sometimes flaws are exposed or\n   they are one of many\
    \ competing solutions to problems.  In these later\n   cases, no discussion is\
    \ presented as it would not serve the purpose\n   of this discussion.\n   5.01.\
    \  RFC 1144 Compressing TCP/IP headers for low-speed serial\n          links\n\
    \      This RFC is specifically oriented towards TCP/IPv4 packet headers\n   \
    \   and will not work in it's current form.  Significant work has\n      already\
    \ been done on similar algorithms for TCP/IPv6 headers.\n   5.02.  RFC 1323 TCP\
    \ Extensions for High Performance\n      There are no IPv4 dependencies in this\
    \ specification.\n   5.03.  RFC 1553 Compressing IPX Headers Over WAN Media (CIPX)\n\
    \      There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.\n   5.04.  RFC 1692\
    \ Transport Multiplexing Protocol (TMux)\n      Section 6.  Implementation Notes\
    \ is states:\n         Because the TMux mini-header does not contain a TOS field,\
    \ only\n         segments with the same IP TOS field should be contained in a\n\
    \         single TMux message.  As most systems do not use the TOS\n         feature,\
    \ this is not a major restriction.  Where the TOS field\n         is used, it\
    \ may be desirable to hold several messages under\n         construction for a\
    \ host, one for each TOS value.\n         Segments containing IP options should\
    \ not be multiplexed.\n      This is clearly IPv4 specific, but a simple restatement\
    \ in IPv6\n      terms will allow complete functionality.\n   5.05.  RFC 1831\

    \      RTSP can be used over IPv6 as long as the media description\n      protocol\
    \ supports IPv6, but only for certain restricted use cases.\n      For full functionality\
    \ there is need for IPv6 support.  The amount\n      of updates needed are small.\n\

    \ Protocol for\n          RSVP-based Admission Control over IEEE 802-style networks\n\
    \      This specification claims to be both IPv4 and IPv6 aware, but  all\n  \
    \    of the examples are given with IPv4 addresses.  That, by itself is\n    \
    \  not a telling point but the following statement is made:\n         a) LocalDSBMAddrInfo\
    \ -- current DSBM's IP address (initially,\n         0.0.0.0) and priority.  All\
    \ IP addresses are assumed to be in\n         network byte order.  In addition,\
    \ current DSBM's L2 address is\n         also stored as part of this state information.\n\
    \      which could just be sloppy wording.  Perhaps a short document\n      clarifying\

- title: 6.0.  Experimental RFCs
  contents:
  - "6.0.  Experimental RFCs\n   Experimental RFCs typically define protocols that\
    \ do not have\n   widescale implementation or usage on the Internet.  They are\
    \ often\n   propriety in nature or used in limited arenas.  They are documented\n\
    \   to the Internet community in order to allow potential\n   interoperability\
    \ or some other potential useful scenario.  In a few\n   cases they are presented\
    \ as alternatives to the mainstream solution\n   to an acknowledged problem.\n\
    \   6.1.  RFC 908 Reliable Data Protocol (RDP)\n      This document is IPv4 limited\
    \ as stated in the following section:\n      4.1.  IP Header Format\n        \
    \ When used in the internet environment, RDP segments are sent\n         using\
    \ the version 4 IP header as described in RFC791, \"Internet\n         Protocol.\"\
    \  The RDP protocol number is ??? (decimal).  The\n         time-to-live field\
    \ should be set to a reasonable value for the\n         network.\n         All\
    \ other fields should be set as specified in RFC-791.\n      A new protocol specification\
    \ would be needed to support IPv6.\n   6.02.  RFC 938 Internet Reliable Transaction\
    \ Protocol functional and\n          interface specification (IRTP)\n      This\
    \ specification states:\n      4.1.  State Variables\n         Each IRTP is associated\
    \ with a single internet address.  The\n         synchronization mechanism of\
    \ the IRTP depends on the\n         requirement that each IRTP module knows the\
    \ internet addresses\n         of all modules with which it will communicate.\
    \  For each remote\n         internet address, an IRTP module must maintain the\
    \ following\n         information (called the connection table):\n         rem_addr\
    \     (32 bit remote internet address)\n      A new specification that is IPv6\
    \ aware would need to be created.\n   6.03.  RFC 998 NETBLT: A bulk data transfer\
    \ protocol\n      This RFC states:\n         The active end specifies a passive\
    \ client through a client-\n         specific \"well-known\" 16 bit port number\
    \ on which the passive\n         end listens.  The active end identifies itself\
    \ through a 32 bit\n         Internet address and a unique 16 bit port number.\n\
    \      Clearly, this is IPv4 dependent, but could easily be modified to\n    \
    \  support IPv6 addressing.\n   6.04.  RFC 1045 VMTP: Versatile Message Transaction\
    \ Protocol\n      This specification has many IPv4 dependencies in its\n     \
    \ implementation appendices.  For operations over IPv6 a similar\n      implementation\
    \ procedure must be defined.  The IPv4 specific\n      information is show below.\n\
    \      IV.1.  Domain 1\n         For initial use of VMTP, we define the domain\
    \ with Domain\n         identifier 1 as follows:\n         +-----------+----------------+------------------------+\n\
    \         | TypeFlags | Discriminator  |    Internet Address    |\n         +-----------+----------------+------------------------+\n\
    \            4 bits          28 bits                32 bits\n         The Internet\
    \ address is the Internet address of the host on\n         which this entity-id\
    \ is originally allocated.  The\n         Discriminator is an arbitrary value\
    \ that is unique relative to\n         this Internet host address.  In addition,\
    \ the host must\n         guarantee that this identifier does not get reused for\
    \ a long\n         period of time after it becomes invalid.  (\"Invalid\" means\
    \ that\n         no VMTP module considers in bound to an entity.)  One technique\n\
    \         is to use the lower order bits of a 1 second clock.  The clock\n   \
    \      need not represent real-time but must never be set back after a\n     \
    \    crash.  In a simple implementation, using the low order bits of\n       \
    \  a clock as the time stamp, the generation of unique identifiers\n         is\
    \ overall limited to no more than 1 per second on average.\n         The type\
    \ flags were described in Section 3.1.\n         An entity may migrate between\
    \ hosts.  Thus, an implementation\n         can heuristically use the embedded\
    \ Internet address to locate\n         an entity but should be prepared to maintain\
    \ a cache of\n         redirects for migrated entities, plus accept Notify operations\n\
    \         indicating that migration has occurred.\n         Entity group identifiers\
    \ in Domain 1 are structured in one of\n         two forms, depending on whether\
    \ they are well-known or\n         dynamically allocated identifiers.  A well-known\
    \ entity\n         identifier is structured as:\n         +-----------+----------------+------------------------+\n\
    \         | TypeFlags |  Discriminator |Internet Host Group Addr|\n         +-----------+----------------+------------------------+\n\
    \            4 bits          28 bits                32 bits\n         with the\
    \ second high-order bit (GRP) set to 1.  This form of\n         entity identifier\
    \ is mapped to the Internet host group address\n         specified in the low-order\
    \ 32 bits.  The Discriminator\n         distinguishes group identifiers using\
    \ the same Internet host\n         group.  Well-known entity group identifiers\
    \ should be allocated\n         to correspond to the basic services provided by\
    \ hosts that are\n         members of the group, not specifically because that\
    \ service is\n         provided by VMTP.  For example, the well-known entity group\n\
    \         identifier for the domain name service should contain as its\n     \
    \    embedded Internet host group address the host group for Domain\n        \
    \ Name servers.\n         A dynamically allocated entity identifier is structured\
    \ as:\n         +-----------+----------------+------------------------+\n    \
    \     | TypeFlags |  Discriminator |   Internet Host Addr   |\n         +-----------+----------------+------------------------+\n\
    \            4 bits          28 bits             32 bits\n         with the second\
    \ high-order bit (GRP) set to 1.  The Internet\n         address in the low-order\
    \ 32 bits is a Internet address assigned\n         to the host that dynamically\
    \ allocates this entity group\n         identifier.  A dynamically allocated entity\
    \ group identifier is\n         mapped to Internet host group address 232.X.X.X\
    \ where X.X.X are\n         the low-order 24 bits of the Discriminator subfield\
    \ of the\n         entity group identifier.\n         We use the following notation\
    \ for Domain 1 entity identifiers\n         <10> and propose it use as a standard\
    \ convention.\n         <flags>-<discriminator>-<Internet address>\n      where\
    \ <flags> are [X]{BE,LE,RG,UG}[A]\n         X = reserved\n         BE = big-endian\
    \ entity\n         LE = little-endian entity\n         RG = restricted group\n\
    \         UG = unrestricted group\n         A  = alias\n      and <discriminator>\
    \ is a decimal integer and <Internet address> is\n      in standard dotted decimal\
    \ IP address notation.\n      V.1.  Authentication Domain 1\n         A principal\
    \ identifier is structured as follows.\n         +---------------------------+------------------------+\n\
    \         |     Internet Address      | Local User Identifier  |\n         +---------------------------+------------------------+\n\
    \                     32 bits                    32 bits\n      VI.  IP Implementation\n\
    \         VMTP is designed to be implemented on the DoD IP Internet\n        \
    \ Datagram Protocol (although it may also be implemented as a\n         local\
    \ network protocol directly in \"raw\" network packets.)\n         The well-known\
    \ entity identifiers specified to date are:\n      VMTP_MANAGER_GROUP   RG-1-224.0.1.0\n\
    \                      Managers for VMTP operations.\n      VMTP_DEFAULT_BECLIENT\
    \  BE-1-224.0.1.0\n                      Client entity identifier to use when\
    \ a (big-\n                      endian) host has not determined or been allocated\n\
    \                      any client entity identifiers.\n      VMTP_DEFAULT_LECLIENT\
    \  LE-1-224.0.1.0\n                      Client entity identifier to use when\
    \ a (little-\n                      endian) host has not determined or been allocated\n\
    \                      any client entity identifiers.\n      Note that 224.0.1.0\
    \ is the host group address assigned to VMTP and\n      to which all VMTP hosts\
    \ belong.\n   6.05.  RFC 1146 TCP alternate checksum options\n      There are\
    \ no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.\n   6.06.  RFC 1151 Version 2 of\
