  - "                   Host-Host Control Message Formats\n   NWG/RFC 11 has been\
    \ modified at UCLA; and will be republished.  In\n   the meantime, it seems important\
    \ to report a new control message\n   format which does not use 7-bit ASCII character\
    \ mode of transmission.\n   All Host-Host control messages consist of sequences\
    \ of 8-bit bytes of\n   the form:\n   <control byte> <parameter byte l> ... <parameter\
    \ byte n>\n   It is reasonable to transmit more than one control message in any\n\
    \   given packet, although this is not mandatory.\n   Presently, 9 control messages\
    \ have been defined by UCLA; these are\n   given in the table below along with\
    \ their parameters.  The\n   interpretation is given from the point of view of\
    \ the transmitting\n   host. (\"L\" or \"Li\" mean Link#, and are binary values.)\n\

    \    We are CLOSING our output link number\n                                 \
    \ L.  You may get this message before\n                                  the last\
    \ message arrives over this\n                                  link since control\
    \ messages are higher\n                                  priority than regular\
    \ data messages.\n    <8>             <L>           UNCEASE: that is, you may\
    \ resume\n                                  transmitting over output link number\n\
    \                                  L.\n   Each control message is embedded in\
    \ the appropriate message structure\n   e.g.:\n               <-------------32\
    \ bits --------------->\n               |           HEADER                   |\n\
