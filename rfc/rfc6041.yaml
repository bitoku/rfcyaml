- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) protocol\n\
    \   defines a standard framework and mechanism for the exchange of\n   information\
    \ between the logically separate functionality of the\n   control and data forwarding\
    \ planes of IP routers and similar devices.\n   It focuses on the communication\
    \ necessary for separation of control\n   plane functionality such as routing\
    \ protocols, signaling protocols,\n   and admission control from data forwarding\
    \ plane per-packet\n   activities such as packet forwarding, queuing, and header\
    \ editing.\n   This document defines the applicability of the ForCES mechanisms.\
    \  It\n   describes types of configurations and settings where ForCES is most\n\
    \   appropriately applied.  This document also describes scenarios and\n   configurations\
    \ where ForCES would not be appropriate for use.\n"
- title: 2.  Purpose
  contents:
  - "2.  Purpose\n   The purpose of the ForCES Applicability Statement is to capture\
    \ the\n   intent of the ForCES protocol [RFC5810] designers as to how the\n  \
    \ protocol could be used in conjunction with the ForCES model [RFC5812]\n   and\
    \ a Transport Mapping Layer [RFC5811].\n"
- title: 3.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "3.  Terminology\n   A set of concepts associated with ForCES was introduced in\n\
    \   \"Requirements for Separation of IP Control and Forwarding\" [RFC3654]\n \
    \  and in \"Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) Framework\"\n \
    \  [RFC3746].  The terminology associated with these concepts and with\n   the\
    \ protocol elements in ForCES is defined in the \"Forwarding and\n   Control Element\
    \ Separation (ForCES) Protocol Specification\"\n   [RFC5810].\n   The reader is\
    \ directed to these documents for the conceptual\n   introduction and for definitions,\
    \ including the following acronyms:\n   o  CE: control element\n   o  CEM: CE\
    \ Manager\n   o  FE: forwarding element\n   o  FEM: FE Manager\n   o  ForCES:\
    \ Forwarding and Control Element Separation protocol\n   o  LFB: Logical Function\

- title: 4.  Applicability to IP Networks
  contents:
  - "4.  Applicability to IP Networks\n   This section lists the areas of ForCES applicability\
    \ in IP network\n   devices.  Some relatively low-end routing systems may be implemented\n\
    \   on simple hardware that performs both control and packet forwarding\n   functionality.\
    \  ForCES may not be useful for such devices.\n   Higher-end routing systems typically\
    \ distribute work amongst several\n   interface-processing elements, and these\
    \ devices (FEs) therefore need\n   to communicate with the control element(s)\
    \ to perform their job.  A\n   higher-end router may also distribute control processing\
    \ amongst\n   several processing elements (CEs).  ForCES provides a standard way\
    \ to\n   do this communication.  ForCES also provides support for high-\n   availability\
    \ configurations that include a primary CE and one or more\n   secondary CEs.\n\
    \   The remainder of this section lists the applicable services that\n   ForCES\
    \ may support, applicable FE functionality, applicable CE-FE\n   link scenarios,\
    \ and applicable topologies in which ForCES may be\n   deployed.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Applicable Services
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Applicable Services\n   In this section we describe the applicability of\
    \ ForCES for the\n   following control-forwarding-plane services:\n   o  Association,\
    \ Capability Discovery, and Information Exchange\n   o  Topology Information Exchange\n\
    \   o  Configuration\n   o  Routing Exchange\n   o  Quality of Service (QoS) Exchange\n\
    \   o  Security Exchange\n   o  Filtering Exchange\n   o  Encapsulation/Tunneling\
    \ Exchange\n   o  NAT and Application-Level Gateways\n   o  Measurement and Accounting\n\
    \   o  Diagnostics\n   o  CE Redundancy or CE Failover\n"
- title: 4.1.1.  Association, Capability Discovery, and Information Exchange
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  Association, Capability Discovery, and Information Exchange\n   Association\
    \ is the first step of the ForCES protocol exchange in\n   which capability discovery\
    \ and exchange happens between one or more\n   CEs and the FEs.  ForCES assumes\
    \ that CEs and FEs already have\n   sufficient information to begin communication\
    \ in a secure manner.\n   The ForCES protocol is only applicable after CEs and\
    \ FEs have\n   discovered each other.  ForCES makes no assumption about whether\n\
    \   discovery was performed using a dynamic protocol or merely static\n   configuration.\
    \  Some discussion about how this can occur can be found\n   in Section 6.4 of\
    \ this document.\n   During the association phase, CEs and FEs exchange capability\n\
    \   information with each other.  For example, the FEs express the number\n  \
    \ of interface ports they provide, as well as the static and\n   configurable\
    \ attributes of each port.\n   In addition to initial configuration, the CEs and\
    \ FEs also exchange\n   dynamic configuration changes using ForCES.  For example,\
    \ FEs\n   asynchronously inform the CEs of an increase/decrease in available\n\
    \   resources or capabilities on the FE.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.  Topology Information Exchange
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  Topology Information Exchange\n   In this context, topology information\
    \ relates to how the FEs are\n   interconnected with each other with respect to\
    \ packet forwarding.\n   Topology discovery is outside the scope of the ForCES\
    \ protocol.  An\n   implementation can choose its own method of topology discovery\
    \ (for\n   example, it can use a standard topology discovery protocol or apply\
    \ a\n   static topology configuration policy).  Once the topology is\n   established,\
    \ the ForCES protocol may be used to transmit the\n   resulting information to\
    \ the CEs.\n"
- title: 4.1.3.  Configuration
  contents:
  - "4.1.3.  Configuration\n   ForCES is used to perform FE configuration.  For example,\
    \ CEs set\n   configurable FE attributes such as IP addresses, etc. for their\n\
    \   interfaces.\n"
- title: 4.1.4.  Routing Exchange
  contents:
  - "4.1.4.  Routing Exchange\n   ForCES may be used to deliver packet forwarding\
    \ information resulting\n   from CE routing calculations.  For example, CEs may\
    \ send forwarding\n   table updates to the FEs, so that they can make forwarding\
    \ decisions.\n   FEs may inform the CEs in the event of a forwarding table miss.\n\
    \   ForCES may also be used to configure Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP)\n   capability.\n"
- title: 4.1.5.  QoS Capabilities Exchange and Configuration
  contents:
  - "4.1.5.  QoS Capabilities Exchange and Configuration\n   ForCES may be used to\
    \ exchange QoS capabilities between CEs and FEs.\n   For example, an FE may express\
    \ QoS capabilities to the CE.  Such\n   capabilities might include metering, policing,\
    \ shaping, and queuing\n   functions.  The CE may use ForCES to configure these\
    \ capabilities.\n"
- title: 4.1.6.  Security Exchange
  contents:
  - "4.1.6.  Security Exchange\n   ForCES may be used to exchange security information\
    \ between a CE and\n   the FEs it controls.  For example, the FE may use ForCES\
    \ to express\n   the types of encryption that it is capable of using in an IP\
    \ Security\n   (IPsec) tunnel.  The CE may use ForCES to configure such a tunnel.\n\
    \   The CEs would be responsible for the NE dynamic key exchanges and\n   updates.\n"
- title: 4.1.7.  Filtering Exchange and Firewalls
  contents:
  - "4.1.7.  Filtering Exchange and Firewalls\n   ForCES may be used to exchange filtering\
    \ information.  For example,\n   FEs may use ForCES to express the filtering functions,\
    \ such as\n   classification and action, that they can perform, and the CE may\n\
    \   configure these capabilities.\n"
- title: 4.1.8.  Encapsulation/Tunneling Exchange
  contents:
  - "4.1.8.  Encapsulation/Tunneling Exchange\n   ForCES may be used to exchange encapsulation\
    \ capabilities of an FE,\n   such as tunneling, and the configuration of such\
    \ capabilities.\n"
- title: 4.1.9.  NAT and Application-Level Gateways
  contents:
  - "4.1.9.  NAT and Application-Level Gateways\n   ForCES may be used to exchange\
    \ configuration information for Network\n   Address Translators.  Whilst ForCES\
    \ is not specifically designed for\n   the configuration of application-level\
    \ gateway functionality, this\n   may be in scope for some types of application-level\
    \ gateways.\n"
- title: 4.1.10.  Measurement and Accounting
  contents:
  - "4.1.10.  Measurement and Accounting\n   ForCES may be used to exchange configuration\
    \ information regarding\n   traffic measurement and accounting functionality.\
    \  In this area,\n   ForCES may overlap somewhat with functionality provided by\
    \ network\n   management mechanisms such as the Simple Network Management Protocol\n\
    \   (SNMP).  In some cases, ForCES may be used to convey information to\n   the\
    \ CE to be reported externally using SNMP.  A further discussion of\n   this capability\
    \ is covered in Section 6 of this document.\n"
- title: 4.1.11.  Diagnostics
  contents:
  - "4.1.11.  Diagnostics\n   ForCES may be used for CEs and FEs to exchange diagnostic\n\
    \   information.  For example, an FE can send self-test results to a CE.\n"
- title: 4.1.12.  Redundancy and Failover
  contents:
  - "4.1.12.  Redundancy and Failover\n   The ForCES architecture includes mechanisms\
    \ that allow for multiple\n   redundant CEs and FEs in a ForCES NE.  The ForCES-model\
    \ LFB\n   definitions provide sufficient component details via component\n   identifiers\
    \ to be universally unique within an NE.  The ForCES\n   protocol includes mechanisms\
    \ to facilitate transactions as well as\n   atomicity across the NE.\n   Given\
    \ the above, it is possible to deploy redundant CEs and FEs that\n   incorporate\
    \ failover.\n"
- title: 4.2.  CE-FE Link Capability
  contents:
  - "4.2.  CE-FE Link Capability\n   When using ForCES, the bandwidth of the CE-FE\
    \ link is a\n   consideration, and cannot be ignored.  For example, sending a\
    \ full\n   routing table is reasonable over a high-bandwidth link, but could be\n\
    \   non-trivial over a lower-bandwidth link.  ForCES should be\n   sufficiently\
    \ future-proof to be applicable in scenarios where routing\n   tables grow to\
    \ several orders of magnitude greater than their current\n   size.  However, we\
    \ also note that not all IP routers need full\n   routing tables.\n"
- title: 4.3.  CE/FE Locality
  contents:
  - "4.3.  CE/FE Locality\n   ForCES is intended for environments where one of the\
    \ following\n   applies:\n   o  The control interconnect is some form of local\
    \ bus, switch, or\n      LAN, where reliability is high, closely controlled, and\
    \ not\n      susceptible to external disruption that does not also affect the\n\
    \      CEs and/or FEs.\n   o  The control interconnect shares its fate with the\
    \ FE's forwarding\n      function.  Typically this is because the control connection\
    \ is\n      also the FE's primary packet forwarding connection, and so if that\n\
    \      link goes down, the FE cannot forward packets anyway.\n   The key guideline\
    \ is that the reliability of the device should not be\n   significantly reduced\
    \ by the separation of control and forwarding\n   functionality.\n   Taking this\
    \ into account, ForCES is applicable in the following CE/FE\n   localities:\n\
    \   Single Box NE:\n      chassis with multiple CEs and FEs set up.  ForCES is\
    \ applicable in\n      localities consisting of control and forwarding elements\
    \ that are\n      components in the same physical box.\n      Example: a network\
    \ element with a single control blade, and one or\n      more forwarding blades,\
    \ all present in the same chassis and\n      sharing an interconnect such as Ethernet\
    \ or Peripheral Component\n      Interconnect (PCI).  In this locality, the majority\
    \ of the data\n      traffic being forwarded typically does not traverse the same\
    \ links\n      as the ForCES control traffic.\n   Multiple Box NE:\n      separated\
    \ CE and FE, where physical locality could be the same\n      rack, room, or building;\
    \ or long distances that could span across\n      continents and oceans.  ForCES\
    \ is applicable in localities\n      consisting of control and forwarding elements\
    \ that are separated\n      by a single hop or multiple hops in the network.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The ForCES protocol allows for a variety of security\
    \ levels\n   [RFC5810].  When operating under a secured physical environment,\
    \ or\n   for other operational concerns (in some cases, performance issues),\n\
    \   the operator may turn off all the security functions between CEs and\n   FEs.\
    \  When the operator makes a decision to secure the path between\n   the FEs and\
    \ CEs, then the operator chooses from one of the options\n   provided by the TML.\
    \  Security choices provided by the TML take\n   effect during the pre-association\
    \ phase of the ForCES protocol.  An\n   operator may choose to use all, some,\
    \ or none of the security\n   services provided by the TML in a CE-FE connection.\
    \  A ForCES NE is\n   required to provide CE/FE node authentication services,\
    \ and may\n   provide message integrity and confidentiality services.  The NE\
    \ may\n   provide these services by employing IPsec or Transport Layer Security\n\
    \   (TLS), depending on the choice of TML used in the deployment of\n   the NE.\n"
- title: 6.  ForCES Manageability
  contents:
  - "6.  ForCES Manageability\n   From the architectural perspective, the ForCES NE\
    \ is a single network\n   element.  As an example, if the ForCES NE is specifically\
    \ a router\n   that needs to be managed, then it should be managed in essentially\n\
    \   the same way any router should be managed.  From another perspective,\n  \
    \ element management could directly view the individual entities and\n   interfaces\
    \ that make up a ForCES NE.  However, any element management\n   updates made\
    \ directly on these entities and interfaces may compromise\n   the control relationship\
    \ between the CEs and the FEs, unless the\n   update mechanism has been accounted\
    \ for in the model used by the NE.\n"
- title: 6.1.  The NE as an Atomic Element
  contents:
  - "6.1.  The NE as an Atomic Element\n   From the ForCES Requirements [RFC3654],\
    \ Section 4, point 4:\n      A NE MUST support the appearance of a single functional\
    \ device.\n   As a single functional device, a ForCES NE runs protocols, and each\n\
    \   of the protocols has its own existing manageability aspects that are\n   documented\
    \ elsewhere.  As an example, a router would also have a\n   configuration interface.\
    \  When viewed in this manner, the NE is\n   controlled as a single routing entity,\
    \ and no new management beyond\n   what is already available for routers and routing\
    \ protocols would be\n   required for a ForCES NE.  Management commands on a management\n\
    \   interface to the NE will arrive at the CE and may require ForCES\n   interactions\
    \ between the CE and FEs to complete.  This may impact the\n   atomicity of such\
    \ commands and may require careful implementation by\n   the CE.\n"
- title: 6.2.  The NE as Composed of Manageable Elements
  contents:
  - "6.2.  The NE as Composed of Manageable Elements\n   When viewed as a decomposed\
    \ set of elements from the management\n   perspective, the ForCES NE is divided\
    \ into a set of one of more\n   control elements, forwarding elements, and the\
    \ interfaces between\n   them.  The interface functionality between the CE and\
    \ the FE is\n   provided by the ForCES protocol.  A MIB module is provided for\
    \ the\n   purpose of gaining management information on the operation of the\n\
    \   protocol described in Section 6.3 of this document.\n   Additionally, the\
    \ architecture makes provisions for configuration\n   control of the individual\
    \ CEs and FEs.  This is handled by elements\n   called the FE Manager (FEM) and\
    \ the CE Manager (CEM).  Specifically,\n   from the ForCES Requirements RFC [RFC3654],\
    \ Section 4, point 4:\n      However, external entities (e.g., FE Managers and\
    \ CE Managers) MAY\n      have direct access to individual ForCES protocol elements\

- title: 6.3.1.  MIB Management of an FE
  contents:
  - "6.3.1.  MIB Management of an FE\n   While it is possible to manage an FE from\
    \ an element manager, several\n   requirements relating to this have been included\
    \ in the ForCES\n   Requirements.\n   From the ForCES Requirements [RFC3654],\
    \ Section 4, point 14:\n      1. The ability for a management tool (e.g., SNMP)\
    \ to be used to\n         read (but not change) the state of FE SHOULD NOT be\
    \ precluded.\n      2. It MUST NOT be possible for management tools (e.g., SNMP,\
    \ etc)\n         to change the state of a FE in a manner that affects overall\
    \ NE\n         behavior without the CE being notified.\n   The ForCES Framework\
    \ [RFC3746], Section 5.7, goes further in\n   discussing the manner in which FEs\
    \ should handle management requests\n   that are specifically directed to the\
    \ FE:\n      (For a ForCES NE that is an IP router,) RFC 1812 [RFC1812] also\n\
    \      dictates that \"Routers must be manageable by SNMP\".  In general,\n  \
    \    for the post-association phase, most external management tasks\n      (including\
    \ SNMP) should be done through interaction with the CE in\n      order to support\

    \ that an SNMP agent be implemented by\n      CEs and that the SNMP messages received\
    \ by FEs be redirected to\n      their CEs.  AgentX framework defined in RFC 2741\
    \ [RFC2741]) may be\n      applied here such that CEs act in the role of master\
    \ agent to\n      process SNMP messages while FEs act in the role of subagent\
    \ to\n      provide access to the MIB objects residing on FEs.  AgentX\n     \
    \ protocol messages between the master agent (CE) and the subagent\n      (FE)\
    \ are encapsulated and transported via ForCES, just like data\n      packets from\
    \ any other application layer protocols.\n"
