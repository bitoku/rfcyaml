- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF Datatracker is used by many IETF community members\
    \ to find\n   the status of Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) and RFCs, and view I-Ds and\
    \ RFCs\n   that meet particular criteria.  The current Datatracker, found at\n\
    \   <https://datatracker.ietf.org/>, allows anyone to search for active\n   I-Ds\
    \ and RFCs, and get a list matching the given criteria.  (The\n   Datatracker\
    \ also allows for expired I-Ds, but those are not relevant\n   to this discussion.)\n\
    \   Users can search in the Datatracker by the filename of the I-D, words\n  \
    \ in the I-D title, I-D author list, associated Working Group (WG),\n   IETF area,\
    \ the responsible Area Director (AD), or IESG status.  They\n   can search for\
    \ RFCs by number or words in the title.  The returned\n   list of I-Ds and/or\
    \ RFCs includes six columns: filename or RFC\n   number, the document's title,\
    \ the date it was published, its status\n   in the IETF or RFC process, IPR statements,\
    \ and the responsible AD\n   (if any).\n   Instead of using the search capability\
    \ of the Datatracker to manually\n   find I-Ds and RFCs of interest, users might\
    \ want to create a list of\n   I-Ds that they normally follow.  Some users will\
    \ want to keep their\n   list to themselves, but others will want to allow others\
    \ to view\n   their list.\n   Different users in the IETF community will have\
    \ different ways that\n   they want to get information on I-D and RFC updates\
    \ and status.  Many\n   users will want to be notified immediately, such as through\
    \ an Atom\n   feed (see [RFC4287]) or automatically-generated email.  Many users\n\
    \   will want to only find out about updates when they go to a Web page.\n   Many\
    \ users might want to get the data for a list as input to other\n   tools.  And,\
    \ of course, some users will want all three.  All of these\n   assist users in\
    \ tracking I-Ds through their lifecycle.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Usage Scenarios
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Usage Scenarios\n   The main motivation for these proposed changes to the\
    \ Datatracker is\n   to allow a variety of potential users to be able to track\
    \ I-Ds and\n   RFCs, and thus be better able to see when important events happen.\
    \  A\n   few examples include:\n   o  A WG chair might want to keep a list of\
    \ all the I-Ds from other\n      WGs that relate to active I-Ds in his or her\
    \ WG.\n   o  That same WG chair might want to help WG members be able to follow\n\
    \      the same I-Ds that he or she is following.\n   o  Someone who cares about\
    \ an established topic such as the DNS may\n      want to follow the various I-Ds\
    \ that might make changes to the\n      DNS, as well as be aware if any of the\
    \ DNS RFCs are later updated\n      and/or have errata posted against them.  This\
    \ would include not\n      only I-Ds that are in the many WGs that directly are\
    \ changing the\n      DNS (DNSEXT, DNSOP, BEHAVE, and so on), but also individual\n\
    \      submissions, IAB I-Ds, IRTF I-Ds, and Independent submissions.\n   o  Developers\
    \ who are not active in the IETF process might want to\n      lightly follow I-Ds\
    \ and RFCs on a particular topic to watch for\n      things that might affect\
    \ their implementations.\n   o  An IETF \"regular\" might want to follow parts\
    \ of the process by\n      focusing on all the I-Ds that are being shepherded\
    \ by a particular\n      Area Director.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Context for This Document
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Context for This Document\n   This document describes the requirements\
    \ for extending the\n   Datatracker for such capabilities.  When complete, this\
    \ document may\n   be used to issue an RFP for the design and development of these\n\
    \   enhancements to the Datatracker.\n   Some of the requirements in this document\
    \ are listed as \"later\n   requirements\".  It is expected that items listed\
    \ in this document\n   would be part of the initial RFP because they provide the\
    \ highest\n   benefit to the community; the later requirements might be part of\
    \ a\n   later RFP.\n   The initial general requirements that led to the specific\n\
    \   requirements this document described tools that include:\n   o  the ability\
    \ to create one or more (possibly large) lists of I-Ds\n      that community members\
    \ want to follow\n   o  the ability to get notifications when particular I-Ds\
    \ from a list\n      change state\n   o  the ability to see all of the state changes\
    \ that have occurred on\n      all the I-Ds in a list over a specified range of\
    \ dates\n   o  the ability to set the granularity of the changes (such as \"every\n\
    \      change\", \"just approvals and publication\", and so on)\n   o  the ability\
    \ to organize views of a list in many fashions that\n      would be useful to\
    \ different types of community members\n   o  the ability to share and merge lists\
    \ with other community members\n   Note that [RFC2026] describes the process that\
    \ I-Ds go through before\n   they either become RFCs or are abandoned.  The Datatracker\
    \ does not\n   control this process: instead, it simply reports on the current\
    \ state\n   of each I-D as it goes through the process.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Definitions Used in This Document
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Definitions Used in This Document\n   A \"user\" is an individual person\
    \ who is a member of the IETF\n   community.\n   A \"list\" is an unordered set\
    \ of RFCs, I-Ds, and groups of I-Ds.\n   Lists are specified by users.  In some\
    \ cases, the authors are role-\n   based, such as a WG chair being the specifier\
    \ of the list associated\n   with that WG.\n   An \"attribute\" is a feature of\
    \ an I-D or RFC, such as its filename or\n   RFC number, its current state in\
    \ the IETF or RFC process, and so on.\n   Attributes are usually displayed as\
    \ columns in the Datatracker.\n   A \"row\" is a set of attributes about a single\
    \ I-D or RFC that is\n   displayed in the Datatracker.\n   A \"significant change\
    \ in status\" is all approvals and disposition of\n   an I-D.  Assuming that the\
    \ changes to the Datatracker specified in\n   [RFC6174], [RFC6175] and [ALTSTREAMS]\
    \ are made, \"all approvals\" means\n   the following:\n   o  IETF stream: the\
    \ WG states \"Adopted by a WG\", \"In WG Last Call\",\n      \"WG Consensus: Waiting\
    \ for Write-up\", \"Parked WG document\", and\n      \"Dead WG document\"; the\
    \ IESG states \"Publication Requested\", \"In\n      Last Call\", \"IESG Evaluation\"\
    , and \"Sent to the RFC Editor\"\n   o  IAB stream: \"Active IAB Document\", \"\
    Community Review\", and \"Sent\n      to the RFC Editor\"\n   o  IRTF stream:\
    \ \"Active RG Document\", \"In RG Last Call\", \"Awaiting\n      IRSG Reviews\"\
    , \"In IESG Review\", \"Sent to the RFC Editor\", and\n      \"Document on Hold\
    \ Based On IESG Request\"\n   o  ISE stream: \"Submission Received\", \"In ISE\
    \ Review\", \"In IESG\n      Review\", \"Sent to the RFC Editor\", and \"Document\
    \ on Hold Based On\n      IESG Request\"\n   o  All streams: in addition to the\
    \ above, the disposition states\n      \"Approved\", \"RFC Published\", and \"\
    Dead\" are also included\n   An \"update to an RFC\" is the announcement of a\
    \ newer RFC that updates\n   or obsoletes the base RFC, an in-place change to\
    \ the RFC's maturity\n   level, the RFC's status being changed to historic, or\
    \ an announcement\n   of an errata posted for the base RFC.\n"
- title: 1.4.  Expected User Interactions
  contents:
  - "1.4.  Expected User Interactions\n   When a user wants to follow a group of I-Ds\
    \ and/or RFCs, he or she\n   goes to the Datatracker and creates a new list. \
    \ The requirements for\n   lists are given in Section 2.1.  After a list is created,\
    \ the user\n   has three ways that he or she might see when I-Ds and/or RFCs in\
    \ the\n   list are updated:\n   o  By going to the Datatracker page for the list\
    \ (see Section 2.3)\n   o  By subscribing to the Atom feed for the list (see Section\
    \ 2.2.2)\n      in a feed reader that automatically fetches updates\n   o  By\
    \ subscribing to the mail stream for the list (see Section 2.2.3)\n      and reading\
    \ the mail stream in their mail reader\n"

    \ might want to follow the status of\n   hundreds of I-Ds and dozens of RFCs;\
    \ for example, some ADs have 100\n   I-Ds in their area.  Additionally, they may\

  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Requirement: Every Datatracker user can create one list\n   When a user\
    \ gets a Datatracker account, that account comes with an\n   empty list pre-defined.\
    \  The list can normally be modified only by\n   the owner of the account, although\
    \ the Secretariat can also modify\n   the list as part of its support role for\

    \ member to get a Datatracker account.  Account setup must\n   not involve any\
    \ direct action on the part of the Secretariat.\n   However, the Secretariat will\
    \ be responsible for support of\n   Datatracker accounts (lost passwords, odd\
    \ interactions, and so on),\n   so this addition of more Datatracker accounts\

  contents:
  - "2.1.4.  Requirement: The Datatracker must support optional publicly-\n      \
    \  readable lists for WGs and Area Directors\n   It is common in the IETF for\
    \ users to follow the work of an entire\n   WG, not just single I-Ds and RFCs\
    \ within a WG.  It is also very\n   common that some work that is related to a\
    \ WG happens outside the WG,\n   either in other WGs or as individual efforts.\
    \  Many WG chairs monitor\n   this outside-the-WG activity for various reasons.\n\
    \   A smaller number of community members follow an entire Area's worth\n   of\
    \ topics.  Again, these topics often happen within the WGs of an\n   area, but\
    \ not always; for example, some topics related to the\n   Security Area happen\
    \ in WGs in the Applications Area.\n   Because of this, it would be useful for\
    \ community members to be able\n   to find a list that corresponds to the WGs\
    \ or Areas in which they are\n   interested.  The WG lists could be maintained\
    \ by the WG chairs; the\n   Area lists would likely be maintained by the ADs.\
    \  Note that such\n   lists are not mandatory; for example, a WG chair might not\
    \ choose to\n   maintain such a list for a WG whose topic is extremely broad.\n\
    \   Both Working Group chairs and Area Directors currently already have\n   Datatracker\
    \ accounts, so fulfilling this requirement only involves\n   associating those\

  - "2.2.1.  Requirement: Users can be notified when an I-D changes status\n   Some\
    \ users do not want to go to the Datatracker's display page to\n   find out when\
    \ an I-D or RFC has been updated.  Instead, they want to\n   be notified immediately\
    \ after the change.  The Datatracker needs to\n   support this type of immediate\
    \ notification, where \"immediate\" means\n   within an hour of a change to any\
    \ I-D or RFC in the list.  This\n   requirement can be met with Atom feeds and\
    \ mail streams, as described\n   in the next two sections.\n   The Datatracker\
    \ might create a generic \"notifications engine\" that\n   can be used to generate\
    \ the Atom feeds and mail streams.  This engine\n   can then be used to later\
    \ add other notification types, such as a\n   Jabber feed.\n"

    \ order by the I-Ds' filenames and RFC\n   numbers, but after the user is off\
    \ the net for a week, he or she\n   might want the view displayed in order of\
    \ changes of status so that\n   those I-Ds and RFCs changed recently appear at\
    \ the top.\n   The default is to list I-Ds in alphabetical order by I-D filename,\n\
    \   with RFCs at the end.  When displaying a list, the Datatracker should\n  \
    \ allow easy sorting of the I-Ds with the following collation orders:\n   o  Alphabetical\

    \ from this list may move to\n   the list of requirements that are expected to\
    \ be integrated during\n   the first round of development.\n   o  The Datatracker\
    \ could list all of the publicly-readable lists (or\n      certainly at least\
    \ the ones associated with IETF activities), and\n      have links from WG pages\
    \ in the Datatracker to the publicly-\n      readable lists maintained by the\
    \ WG chairs.\n   o  Draft versions of this RFC included a requirement to be able\
    \ to\n      include other lists.  While this may still be desired, it was\n  \
    \    decided that implementing this in a safe and understandable way\n      would\
    \ be too difficult.  In particular, there was a concern about\n      detecting\
    \ and handling loops.  Later versions of the Datatracker\n      might include\
    \ this feature.\n   o  In public lists, it might be useful for someone to be able\
    \ to\n      understand why particular I-Ds and/or groups are added.  Allowing\n\
    \      the user who put together the list to add a comment field would\n     \
    \ help someone else understand the motivation.\n   o  The Datatracker might remove\
    \ lists if it seems that storing them\n      on the Datatracker is taking too\
    \ many resources.  The Datatracker\n      can periodically send mail to the user\
    \ reminding them to delete\n      lists that are no longer needed.\n   o  The\
    \ normal Datatracker display could have a button to add a\n      particular I-D\
    \ to the user's personal list.\n   o  Allow each user to determine what \"significant\
    \ change in status\"\n      is for the list they create.  This could be done by\
    \ a series of\n      check boxes for every possible status change.\n   o  A list\
    \ creator can add a list-level comment about who might be\n      interested in\
    \ following the list.\n   o  If the agendas for an upcoming meeting are scraped\
    \ for I-D names,\n      it would be possible to add an attribute to an I-D that\
    \ lists that\n      WG agenda(s) on which it appears.\n   o  In the section on\
    \ \"Adding groups of I-Ds to a list by attribute\",\n      add an attribute for\
    \ \"all I-Ds that are referenced by any I-D in a\n      particular list\".\n \
    \  o  Make it possible to add all I-Ds that have a certain section to a\n    \
    \  list (non-trivial IANA considerations, ASN.1 modules in\n      appendices,\
    \ MIBs, ABNF, XML modules, ...).\n   o  Even though Atom feeds have been around\
    \ for years, they are new to\n      many Internet users, and even experienced\
    \ users only know how to\n      use them in limited ways.  The Datatracker should\
    \ have at least a\n      few paragraphs explaining how the Atom feeds that it\
