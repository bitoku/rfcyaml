  - "2.  Command Meanings\n   IAC WILL SUPPRESS-GO-AHEAD\n      The sender of this
    command requests permission to begin\n      suppressing transmission of the TELNET
    GO AHEAD (GA) character\n      when transmitting data characters, or the sender
    of this command\n      confirms it will now begin suppressing transmission of
    GAs with\n      transmitted data characters.\n   IAC WON'T SUPPRESS-GO-AHEAD\n
    \     The sender of this command demands to begin transmitting, or to\n      continue
    transmitting, the GA character when transmitting data\n      characters.\n   IAC
    DO SUPPRESS-GO-AHEAD\n      The sender of this commannd requests that the sender
    of data start\n      suppressing GA when transmitting data, or the sender of this\n
    \     command confirms that the sender of data is expected to suppress\n      transmission
    of GAs.\n   IAC DON'T SUPPRESSS-GO-AHEAD\n      The sender of this command demands
    that the receiver of the\n      command start or continue transmitting GAs when
    transmitting data.\n"

  - "4. Motivation for the Option\n   While the NVT nominally follows a half duplex
    protocol complete with\n   a GO AHEAD signal, there is no reason why a full duplex
    connection\n   between a full duplex terminal and a host optimized to handle full\n
    \  duplex terminals should be burdened with the GO AHEAD signal.\n   Therefore,
    it is desirable to have a TELNET option with which parties\n   involved can agree
    that one or the other or both should suppress\n   transmission of GO AHEADS.\n"
  title: 4. Motivation for the Option

  - "5.  Description of the Option\n   When the SUPPRESS-GO-AHEAD option is in effect
    on the connection\n   between a sender of data and the receiver of the data, the
    sender\n   need not transmit GAs.\n   It seems probable that the parties to the
    TELNET connection will\n   suppress GO AHEAD in both directions of the TELNET
    connection if GO\n   AHEAD is suppressed at all;  but, nonetheless, it must be
    suppressed\n   in both directions independently.\n   With the SUPPRESS-GO-AHEAD
    option in effect, the IAC GA command\n   should be treated as a NOP if received,
    although IAC GA should not\n   normally be sent in this mode.\n"

  - "6.  Implementation Considerations\n   As the SUPRESS-GO-AHEAD option is sort
    of the opposite of a line at a\n   time mode, the sender of data which is suppressing
    GO AHEADs should\n   attempt to actually transmit characters as soon as possible
    (i.e.,\n   with minimal buffering) consistent with any other agreements which\n
    \  are in effect.\n   In many TELNET implementations it will be desirable to couple
    the\n   SUPPRESS-GO-AHEAD option to the echo option so that when the echo\n   option
    is in effect, the SUPPRESS-GO-AHEAD option is in effect\n   simultaneously:  both
    of these options will normally have to be in\n   effect simultaneously to effect
    what is commonly understood to be\n   character at a time echoing by the remote
    computer.\n"
