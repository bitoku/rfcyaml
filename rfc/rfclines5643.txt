Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in IPv6 based internets.
In particular, it defines objects for managing the Open Shortest Path
(OSPF) Routing Protocol for IPv6, otherwise known as OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3).
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for managing the Open Shortest Path First Routing Protocol for IPv6 [RFC5340], otherwise known as OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3).
Though the fundamental mechanisms of OSPF version 2 (OSPFv2)
[RFC2328] remain unchanged in OSPFv3, some changes were necessary due to differences in IP address size and in protocol semantics between IPv4 and IPv6.
In many cases, where the protocol operations have not changed from OSPFv2, the specification for OSPFv3 does not restate the details but instead refers to the relevant sections in the OSPFv2 specification.
This MIB module follows along the same lines and includes Reference clauses referring to the OSPFv2 specification when applicable.
IPv6 Interfaces IPv6 interfaces attach to links [RFC2460].
A link is roughly defined as the layer below IPv6 (e.g., Ethernet, IPv4 Tunnel).
One or more IPv6 prefixes can be associated with an IPv6 interface.
IPv6 interfaces and the prefixes associated with those interfaces can be configured via the IP MIB [RFC4293].
IPv6 interfaces are configured in the IPv6 Interface Table and IPv6 prefixes are configured in the Internet Address Prefix Table.
An IPv6 interface is identified by a unique index value.
Address Prefix Table entries associated with an IPv6 interface reference the interface's index.
Whereas an Interface Identifier in OSPFv2 is a local IPv4 address or MIB 2 interface index, an OSPFv3 Interface Identifier is an IPv6 interface index.
For example, the index value of an OSPFv3 Interface Table entry is the IPv6 interface index of the IPv6 interface over which OSPFv3 is configured to operate.
Addressing Semantics Router ID, Area ID, and Link State ID remain at the OSPFv2 size of 32 bits.
To ensure uniqueness, a router running both IPv4 and IPv6 concurrently can continue to use a local IPv4 host address, represented as an unsigned 32 bit value, as the OSPFv3 Router ID.
Otherwise, the Router ID must be selected using another method (e.g., administratively assigned).
Router ID, Area ID, and Link State ID do not have addressing semantics in OSPFv3, so their syntax is changed to Unsigned32.
The Router ID index component comes before the Link State ID index component in the OSPFv3 MIB module because the lack of addressing semantics in Link State IDs makes them less unique identifiers than the Router ID.
It is more useful to do partial Object Identifier (OID) lookups extending to the Router ID rather than the Link State ID.
In OSPFv3, authentication has been removed from the protocol itself.
MIB objects related to authentication are not carried forward from the OSPFv2 MIB module.
MIB module objects related to Type of Service (ToS) are not carried forward to the OSPFv3 MIB module.
Flooding Scope Flooding scope for link state advertisements (LSAs) has been generalized and is now explicitly encoded in the LSA's LS type field.
The action to take upon receipt of unknown LSA types is also encoded in the LS type field [RFC5340].
The OSPFv3 MIB module defines three Link State Database tables, one each for Area scope LSAs, Link scope
LSAs, and Autonomous System (AS) scope LSAs.
Virtual Links Since addressing semantics have been removed from router LSAs in OSPFv3, virtual links now need to be assigned an Interface ID for advertisement in Hello packets and in router LSAs.
A read only object has been added to the Virtual Interface Table entry to view the assigned Interface ID.
The OSPFv3 Neighbor Table is a read only table that contains information learned from Hellos received from neighbors, including configured neighbors.
The OSPFv3 Configured Neighbor Table contains entries for manually configured neighbors for use on non broadcast multi access (NBMA) and Point to Multipoint interface types.
This MIB module defines several counters, namely: ospfv3OriginateNewLsas and ospfv3RxNewLsas in the ospfv3GeneralGroup ospfv3AreaSpfRuns and ospfv3AreaNssaTranslatorEvents in the ospfv3AreaTable ospfv3IfEvents in the ospfv3IfTable ospfv3VirtIfEvents in the ospfv3VirtIfTable ospfv3NbrEvents in the ospfv3NbrTable ospfv3VirtNbrEvents in the ospfv3VirtNbrTable As a best practice, a management entity, when reading these counters, should use the discontinuity object, ospfv3DiscontinuityTime, to determine if an event that would invalidate the management entity understanding of the counters has occurred.
A restart of the OSPFv3 routing process is an example of a discontinuity event.
Multiple OSPFv3 Instances SNMPv3 supports "contexts" that can be used to implement MIB views on multiple OSPFv3 instances on the same system.
See [RFC3411] or its successors for details.
Notifications Notifications define a set of notifications, objects, and mechanisms to enhance the ability to manage IP internetworks that use OSPFv3 as their Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP).
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
Introduction OSPFv3 is an event driven routing protocol, where an event can be a change in an OSPFv3 interface's link level status, the expiration of an OSPFv3 timer, or the reception of an OSPFv3 protocol packet.
Many of the actions that OSPFv3 takes as a result of these events will result in a change of the routing topology.
As routing topologies become large and complex, it is often difficult to locate the source of a topology change or unpredicted routing path by polling a large number or routers.
Because of the difficulty of polling a large number of devices, a more prudent approach is for devices to notify a network manager of potentially critical OSPF events using SNMP notifications.
The ospfv3NotificationEnable object provides a coarse level of control over the generation of OSPFv3 notifications.
It can be used to completely enable or disable generation of OSPFv3 notifications.
Fine grain control of individual notifications can be accomplished by utilizing the objects defined in RFC 3413
[RFC3413], specifically those described in Section 6. 3.2.
The majority of critical events occur when OSPFv3 is enabled on a router, at which time the Designated Router is elected and neighbor adjacencies are formed.
During this initial period, a potential flood of notifications is unnecessary since the events are expected.
To avoid unnecessary notifications, a router should not originate expected OSPFv3 interface related notifications until two of that interface's dead timer intervals have elapsed.
The expected OSPFv3 interface notifications are ospfv3IfStateChange, ospfv3VirtIfStateChange, ospfv3NbrStateChange, and ospfv3VirtNbrStateChange.
The mechanism for throttling the notifications is similar to the mechanism explained in RFC 1224 [RFC1224].
The basic premise of the throttling mechanism is that of a sliding window, defined in seconds and with an upper bound on the number of notifications that may be generated within this window.
Note that unlike RFC 1224, notifications are not sent to inform the network manager that the throttling mechanism has kicked in.
A single window should be used to throttle all OSPFv3 notifications types except for the ospfv3LsdbOverflow and the ospfv3LsdbApproachingOverflow notifications, which should not be throttled.
For example, with a window time of 3, an upper bound of 3, and events to cause notifications 1, 2, 3, and 4 (4 notifications within a 3 second period), the 4th notification should not be generated.
Appropriate values are 7 notifications with a window time of 10 seconds.
One Notification per OSPFv3 Event Several of the notifications defined in this MIB module are generated as the result of finding an unusual condition while parsing an OSPFv3 packet or processing a timer event.
There may be more than one unusual condition detected while handling the event.
For example, a Link State Update packet may contain several retransmitted link state advertisements (LSAs), or a retransmitted database description packet may contain several database description entries.
To limit the number of notifications and variables, OSPFv3 should generate at most one notification per OSPFv3 event.
Only the variables associated with the first unusual condition should be included with the notification.
Similarly, if more than one type of unusual condition is encountered while parsing the packet, only the first event will generate a notification.
Many of the tables in the OSPFv3 MIB module contain generalized event counters.
By enabling the notifications defined in this document, a network manager can obtain more specific information about these events.
A network manager may want to poll these event counters and enable OSPFv3 notifications when a particular counter starts increasing abnormally.
Structure of the OSPFv3 MIB Module
The MIB is composed of the following sections:
General Variables Area Table Area Scope Link State Database Link Scope Link State Databases (non virtual and virtual)
AS Scope Link State Database Host Table
Interface Table Virtual Interface Table Neighbor Table Configured Neighbor
Table Virtual Neighbor Table Area Aggregate Table Notifications 4.1.
The General Variables are global to the OSPFv3 Process.
The Area Data Structure describes the OSPFv3 Areas that the router participates in.
Area Scope, Link Scope, and AS Scope Link State Database
The link state databases are provided primarily to provide detailed information for network debugging.
There are separate tables for Link scope LSAs received over non virtual and virtual interfaces.
The Host Table is provided to view configured Host Route information.
The Interface Table describes the various IPv6 links on which OSPFv3 is configured.
The Virtual Interface Table describes virtual OSPFv3 links.
Neighbor, Configured Neighbor, and Virtual Neighbor Tables
The Neighbor Table, the Configured Neighbor Table, and the Virtual Neighbor Table describe the neighbors to the OSPFv3 Process.
The Area Aggregate Table describes prefixes, which summarize routing information for export outside of an Area.
Notifications Notifications are defined for OSPFv3 events.
Several objects are defined specifically as variables to be used with notifications.

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
Improper manipulation of the objects represented by this MIB module may result in disruption of network connectivity by administratively disabling the entire OSPFv3 entity or individual interfaces, by deleting configured neighbors, by reducing the limit on External LSAs, by changing ASBR status, by manipulating route aggregation, by manipulating interface and route metrics, by changing Hello interval or dead interval, or by changing interface type.
Remote monitoring can be defeated by disabling of SNMP notifications.
Performance can be impacted by increasing the limit on External LSAs or changing DR/BDR (Designated Router / Backup Designated Router) priority.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
Unauthorized access to readable objects in this MIB module allows the discovery of the network topology and operating parameters, which can be used to target further attacks on the network or to gain a competitive business advantage.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
