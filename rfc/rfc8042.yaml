  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies an optional OSPF protocol extension to\n\
    \   represent router metrics in a multi-access network in two parts: the\n   metric\
    \ from the router to the network and the metric from the network\n   to the router.\
    \  For such networks, the router-to-router metric for\n   OSPF route computation\
    \ is the sum of the two parts.  This document\n   updates RFC 2328.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   With Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) [RFC2328] [RFC5340]),\
    \ a Network-\n   LSA (Link State Advertisement) is advertised to list all routers\
    \ on a\n   broadcast network.  Additionally, each router on the broadcast\n  \
    \ network includes a link in its Router-LSA to describe its connection\n   to\
    \ the network.  The link in the Router-LSA includes a metric but the\n   listed\
    \ routers in the Network-LSA do not include a metric.  This is\n   based on the\
    \ assumption that from a particular router, all others on\n   the same network\
    \ can be reached with the same metric.\n   With some broadcast networks, different\
    \ routers can be reached with\n   different metrics.  [RFC6845] extends the OSPF\
    \ protocol with a hybrid\n   interface type for that kind of broadcast network,\
    \ where no Network-\n   LSA is advertised and Router-LSAs simply include point-to-point\
    \ links\n   to all routers on the same network with individual metrics.\n   Broadcast\
    \ capability is still used to optimize database\n   synchronization and adjacency\
    \ maintenance.\n   This works well for broadcast networks where the metric between\n\
    \   different pairs of routers are really independent, for example,\n   Virtual\
    \ Private LAN Service (VPLS) networks.\n   With certain types of broadcast networks,\
    \ further optimization can be\n   made to reduce the size of Router-LSAs and the\
    \ number of updates.\n   Consider a satellite radio network with fixed and mobile\
    \ ground\n   terminals.  All communication goes through the satellite.  When the\n\
    \   mobile terminals move about, their communication capability may\n   change.\
    \  When OSPF runs over the radio network, [RFC6845] hybrid\n   interface can be\
    \ used, but with the following drawbacks.\n   Consider that one terminal/router\
    \ moves into an area where its\n   communication capability degrades significantly.\
    \  Through the radio\n   control protocol, all other routers determine that the\
    \ metric to this\n   particular router changed and they all need to update their\
    \ Router-\n   LSAs accordingly.  In addition, the router in question determines\n\
    \   that its metric to reach all others also changed and it needs to\n   update\
    \ its Router-LSA.  Consider that there could be many terminals\n   and many of\
    \ them can be moving fast and frequently.  The number and\n   frequency of updates\
    \ of those large Router-LSAs could inhibit network\n   scaling.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Requirements Language
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Proposed Enhancement
  contents:
  - "2.  Proposed Enhancement\n   Notice that in the above scenario, when one terminal's\
    \ communication\n   capability changes, its metric to all other terminals and\
    \ the metric\n   to it from all other terminals will all change in a similar fashion.\n\
    \   Given this, the above problem can be easily addressed by breaking the\n  \
    \ metric into two parts: the metric to the satellite and the metric\n   from the\
    \ satellite.  The metric from terminal R1 to R2 would be the\n   sum of the metric\
    \ from R1 to the satellite and the metric from the\n   satellite to R2.\n   Instead\
    \ of using the hybrid interface type described in [RFC6845],\n   the network is\
    \ treated as a regular broadcast network.  A router on\n   the network no longer\
    \ lists individual metrics to each neighbor in\n   its Router-LSA.  Instead, each\
    \ router advertises the metric from the\n   network to itself in addition to the\
    \ normal metric for the network.\n   With the normal Router-to-Network and additional\
    \ Network-to-Router\n   metrics advertised for each router, individual Router-to-Router\n\
    \   metrics can be calculated.\n   With the proposed enhancement, the size of\
    \ the Router-LSA will be\n   significantly reduced.  In addition, when a router's\
    \ communication\n   capability changes, only that router needs to update its Router-LSA.\n\
    \   Note that while the example uses the satellite as the relay point at\n   the\
    \ radio level (layer 2), the satellite does not participate in\n   packet forwarding\
    \ at layer 3.  In fact, the satellite does not need\n   to run any layer-3 protocol.\
    \  Therefore, for generality, the metric\n   is abstracted as to/from the \"network\"\
    \ rather than specifically to/\n   from the \"satellite\".\n"
- title: 3.  Specifications
  contents:
  - "3.  Specifications\n   The following specifications are added to or modified\
    \ from the base\n   OSPF protocol.  If an area contains one or more two-part metric\n\
    \   networks, then all routers in the area MUST support the extensions\n   specified\
    \ herein.  This is ensured by procedures described in\n   Section 3.7.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Router Interface Parameters
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Router Interface Parameters\n   The \"Router interface parameters\" have\
    \ the following additions:\n   o  Two-part metric: TRUE if the interface connects\
    \ to a multi-access\n      network that uses a two-part metric.  All routers connected\
    \ to the\n      same network SHOULD have the same configuration for their\n  \
    \    corresponding interfaces.\n   o  Interface input cost: Link-state metric\
    \ from the two-part-metric\n      network to this router.  Defaults to \"Interface\
    \ output cost\" but\n      is not valid for normal networks using a single metric.\
    \  May be\n      configured or dynamically adjusted to a value different from\
    \ the\n      \"Interface output cost\".\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.  Advertising Network-to-Router Metric in OSPFv2\n   For OSPFv2, the Network-to-Router\
    \ metric is encoded in an OSPF\n   Extended Link TLV Sub-TLV [RFC7684], defined\
    \ in this document as the\n   Network-to-Router Metric Sub-TLV.  The type of the\
    \ sub-TLV is 4.  The\n   length of the sub-TLV is 4 (for the value part only).\
    \  The value part\n   of the sub-TLV is defined as follows:\n       0        \

    \ (MT-ID) and will adhere to the\n   advertisement rules defined in Section 3.4\
    \ of [RFC4915].  The OSPF\n   Extended Link TLV identifies the transit link to\
    \ the network and is\n   part of an OSPFv2 Extended-Link Opaque LSA.  The sub-TLV\
    \ MUST ONLY\n   appear in Extended-Link TLVs for Link Type 2 (link to transit\n\

  contents:
  - "3.5.  OSPF Stub Router Behavior\n   When an OSPF router with interfaces to multi-access\
    \ networks using\n   two-part metrics is advertising itself as a stub router [RFC6987],\n\
    \   only the Router-to-Network metric in the stub router's OSPF Router-\n   LSA\
    \ links for those networks is set to the MaxLinkMetric.  This is\n   fully backward\
    \ compatible and will result in the same behavior as\n   described in [RFC6987].\n"
- title: 3.6.  SPF Calculation
  contents:
  - "3.6.  SPF Calculation\n   The first stage of the shortest-path tree calculation\
    \ is described in\n   Section 16.1 of [RFC2328].  With a two-part metric, when\
    \ a vertex V\n   corresponding to a Network-LSA has just been added to the Shortest\n\
    \   Path Tree (SPT) and an adjacent vertex W (joined by a link in V's\n   corresponding\
    \ Network-LSA) is being added to the candidate list, the\n   cost from V to W\
    \ (W's network-to-router cost) is determined as\n   follows:\n   o  For OSPFv2,\
    \ if vertex W has a corresponding Extended-Link Opaque\n      LSA with an Extended\
    \ Link TLV for the link from W to V, and the\n      Extended Link TLV has a Network-to-Router\
    \ Metric Sub-TLV for the\n      corresponding topology, then the cost from V to\
    \ W is the metric in\n      the sub-TLV.  Otherwise, the cost is 0.\n   o  OSPFv3\
    \ [RFC5340] Shortest Path First (SPF) changes will be\n      described in a separate\

  contents:
  - "3.7.  Backward Compatibility\n   Due to the change of procedures in the SPF calculation,\
    \ all routers\n   in an area that includes one or more two-part metric networks\
    \ must\n   support the changes specified in this document.  To ensure that, if\n\
    \   an area is provisioned to support two-part metric networks, all\n   routers\
    \ supporting this capability must advertise a Router\n   Information (RI) LSA\
    \ with a Router Functional Capabilities TLV\n   [RFC7770] that includes the following\
    \ Router Functional Capability\n   Bit:\n             Bit       Capabilities\n\
    \             6         Two-Part Metric support\n   Upon detecting the presence\
