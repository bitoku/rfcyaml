  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document catalogs currently available implementations\
    \ of X.500,\n   including commercial products and openly available offerings.\
    \  For\n   the purposes of this survey, we classify X.500 products as,\n     \
    \ DSA\n         A DSA is an OSI application process that provides the Directory\n\
    \         functionality,\n      DUA\n         A DUA is an OSI application process\
    \ that represents a user in\n         accessing the Directory and uses the DAP\
    \ to communicate with a\n         DSA, and\n      DUA Interface\n         A DUA\
    \ Interface is an application process that  represents a\n         user in accessing\
    \ the Directory using either DAP but supporting\n         only a  subset of the\
    \ DAP functionality or a protocol different\n         from DAP to communicate\
    \ with a  DSA or DUA.\n   Section 2 of this document contains a listing of implementations\n\
    \   cross referenced by keyword.  This list should aid in identifying\n   implementations\
    \ that meet your criteria.\n   To compile this catalog, the IDS Working Group\
    \ solicited input from\n   the X.500 community by publishing a URL for a set of\
    \ on-line\n   description forms deployed on the WWW as a home page on an InterNIC\n\
    \   server. This URL\n   (http://www.internic.net/projects/x500catalog/catalogtop.html)\
    \ was\n   advertised on the following directory-related mailing lists:\n   iso@nic.ddn.mil,\
    \ isode@nic.ddn.mil, osi-ds@cs.ucl.ac.uk,\n   ids@merit.edu, ietf-asid@umich.edu,\
    \ mhs-ds@mercury.udev.cdc.com,\n   nadf-l@ema.org, and dssig@nist.gov.\n   Readers\
    \ are encouraged to submit comments regarding both the forms\n   and content of\
    \ this memo.  New submissions are welcome.  Please\n   direct input to the Integrated\
    \ Directory Services (IDS) Working Group\n   (ietf-ids@umich.edu) or to the authors.\
    \  IDS will produce new\n   versions of this document when a significant number\
    \ of substantive\n   comments have been received or when significant updates and/or\n\
    \   modifications to X.500-related standards documents have been\n   ratified.\
    \  This will be determined by the IDS chairpersons.\n"
- title: 1.1  Purpose
  contents:
  - "1.1  Purpose\n   The Internet has experienced a steady growth in X.500 piloting\n\
    \   activities. This document hopes to provide an easily accessible\n   source\
    \ of information on X.500 implementations for those who wish to\n   consider X.500\
    \ technology for deploying a Directory service.\n"
- title: 1.2  Scope
  contents:
  - "1.2  Scope\n   This document contains descriptions of both free and commercial\
    \ X.500\n   implementations.  It does not provide instructions on how to install,\n\
    \   run, or manage these implementations.  The descriptions and indices\n   are\
    \ provided to make the readers aware of available options and thus\n   enable\
    \ more informed choices.\n"
- title: 1.3 Disclaimer
  contents:
  - "1.3 Disclaimer\n   Implementation descriptions were written by implementors and\
    \ vendors,\n   and not by the editors. We worked with the description authors\
    \ to\n   ensure uniformity and readability, but cannot guarantee the accuracy\n\
    \   or completeness of the descriptions, nor the stability of the\n   implementations.\n"
- title: 1.4  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.4  Overview\n   Section 1 contains introductory information.\n   Section 2\
    \ contains a list of keywords, their definitions, a cross\n   reference of the\
    \ X.500 implementations by these keywords and a table\n   containing implementor\
    \ name, implementor abreviation, and the page of\n   this document on which the\
    \ description begins for a particular\n   implementor.\n   Section 3 contains\
    \ the X.500 implementation descriptions.\n   Section 4 has a list of references.\n\
    \   Section 6 lists the editors' addresses.\n"
- title: 1.5  Acknowledgments
  contents:
  - "1.5  Acknowledgments\n   The creation of this catalog would not have been possible\
    \ without the\n   efforts of the description authors and the members of the IDS\
    \ Working\n   Group.  Our special thanks to the editors of [RFC 1632], Linda\n\
    \   Millington and Sri Sataluri who graciously contributed the nroff\n   source\
    \ file used to structure their version of the catalog.\n"
- title: 2.  Keywords
  contents:
  - "2.  Keywords\n   Keywords are abbreviated attributes of the X.500 implementations.\n\
    \   The list of keywords defined below was derived from the\n   implementation\
    \ descriptions themselves.  Implementations were indexed\n   by a keyword either\
    \ as a result of: (1) explicit, not implied,\n   reference to a particular capability\
    \ in the implementation\n   description text, or (2) input from the implementation\
    \ description\n   author(s).\n"
- title: 2.1  Keyword Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.1  Keyword Definitions\n   This section contains keyword definitions.  They\
    \ have been organized\n   and grouped by functional category. The definitions\
    \ are ordered first\n   alphabetically by keyword category, and second alphabetically\
    \ by\n   implementation name within keyword category.\n"

- title: ABSTRACT
  contents:
  - "ABSTRACT\n   The X.500 Enabler product allows an LDAP-only directory server to\
    \ be\n   integrated into X.500 environments, by transparently converting X.500\n\
    \   DAP and DSP requests into LDAP requests.\n   The initial release scheduled\
    \ for 4Q96 will allow for connections\n   from X.500-capable clients and servers\
    \ to an LDAP-capable server, and\n   will support the following features:\n  \
    \    * LDAP version 2, as defined in RFC 1777,\n      * all attributes defined\
    \ for LDAPv2, with the exception of\n        certificates  and revocation lists,\n\
    \      * X.500(1988) DAP and DSP protocols over TCP/IP (using  RFC\n        1006),\n\
    \      * the following operations: Bind (with  none or simple\n        credentials),\
    \ Read, Compare, List, Search, Abandon, AddEntry,\n        ModifyEntry, RemoveEntry\
    \ and ModifyRDN,\n      * the X.500(1993) critical extensions field, to aid in\n\
    \        deployments incorporating 1993 DSAs.\n   This release will be available\
    \ for Solaris 2.5 (SPARC and Intel) and\n   Windows NT 4.0 Server (Intel).\n \
    \  The product is expected to enter a public beta test period in\n   September\
    \ 1996.  Beta test evaluation copies will be free (limited to\n   two copies per\
    \ site) but will be set to expire in December 1996.\n   Released versions of X.500\
    \ Enabler will be licensed per server, and\n   will be distributed over the Internet.\n"

    \   portable and flexible Unix based Administrative Directory User Agent.\n  \
    \ The goal of the original design was to support features to assist a\n   directory\
    \ administrator in managing the directory.  These features\n   include a highly\
    \ portable GUI, Entry Templates, Entry Lists, Batch\n   Operations and Directory\
    \ Control Functions.\n   Both the Windows and the Unix versions support strong\

  contents:
  - "ABSTRACT\n   DC X500 provides a truly scalable X.500 based enterprise directory\n\
    \   server with the necessary architectural flexibility to enable\n   integration\
    \ with existing database and directory technologies.\n   From a pure X.500 standpoint,\
    \ DC X500 provides a full function\n   state-of-the-art DSA implementation.\n\
    \      * Architected from scratch according to the 1993 X.500\n        standards\
    \ (i.e. not a 1988 DSA with 1993 features grafted on)\n      * Support for all\
    \ the key X.500 OSI protocols:\n         * Directory Access Protocol (DAP) for\
    \ user access\n         * Directory System Protocol (DSP) for distributed DSA\n\
    \           comunications\n         * Directory Information Shadowing Protocol\
    \ (DISP) to support\n           replication between servers to give improved performance\n\
    \           in a distributed network\n      * Support of the 1993 Basic Access\
    \ Control and  Simplified\n        Access Control models\n      * Support for\
    \ the key Internet  X.500 related standards:\n         * integrated Lightweight\
    \ DAP (LDAP)for DUA access\n         * Madman MIBs for easy integration with SNMP\n\
    \   The DC X500 architecture is based on Data Connection's underlying\n   product\
    \ architecture which has evolved since 1987 and includes:\n         * genuine\
    \ multi-threaded implementation\n         * true  portability (the product is\
    \ available on a range of\n           operating systems e.g Windows NT, AIX, HP-UX.\
    \ OS/2 etc and it\n           is possible to port the core  technology to any\n\
    \           hardware/software platform)\n         * secure service recording for\
    \ operation tracking and billing\n         * support for system monitoring (both\
    \ alarms and statistics)\n   Key product features include:\n         * Name resolution\
    \ and integrated use of Search Indices based on\n           2-3 trees leads to\
    \ high performance operation evaluation\n           (subsecond response times\
    \ on  million entry DSAs)\n         * Generic schema support based on 1993 concepts\
    \ that allows\n           customers to tailor the schema to meet their precise\
    \ data\n           structuing requirements\n         * System recycle time is\
    \ minimised (e.g. DC X500 can be backed\n           up while running and  search\
    \ indices are dynamically updated),\n           helping achieve the goal of continuous\
    \ (24x7) availability\n           and high reliability.\n         * No artificial\
    \ software constraints are imposed resulting in a\n           truly scalable product\
    \ - assuming the availability of the\n           necessary hardware DC X500 can\
    \ be configured  to support\n           millions of entries in a single DSA.\n\
    \   DC X500 is certified for used within the Paradise Pilot project.  The\n  \
    \ product has also undergone interoperability testing at the EuroSInet\n   interoperability\
    \ workshops in Europe.\n"

  - "ABSTRACT\n   DE (Directory Enquiries) is intended to be a simple-to-use DUA\n\
    \   interface, suitable for the naive user, and suitable for running as a\n  \
    \ public access dua.  it will work on any terminal.  The user is\n   presented\
    \ with a series of (verbose) prompts asking for person's name\n   department organization\
    \  country.  There is extensive on-line help.\n   The matching algorithms are\
    \ such that near matches are presented to\n   the user before less good matches.\n\
    \   There have been a few minor enhancements since the description in\n   [RFC\
    \ 1632].  The power searching feature still sets DE apart from\n   most other\
    \ DUAs - this allows a user to search for an entry even when\n   they do not know\
    \ the name of the organisation in which the person\n   works - you still have\
    \ to specify the country.  DE also allows UFN\n   style searching.  DE uses slightly\
    \ different search algorithms\n   depending on whether it is accessing part of\
    \ the Directory mastered\n   by a Quipu DSA - Quipu DSAs tend to use lots of replication\
    \ and so\n   encourage searching.  DE incorporates a QOS feature where it\n  \
    \ maintains a database of past information availability and DSA\n   responsiveness.\
    \  Translations exist into at least 4 different\n   languages.\n   DE runs over\
    \ ISODE DAP and University of Michigan LDAP.  There is a\n   version of DE, called\
    \ DOS-DE, which has been ported to DOS, and this\n   uses LDAP.\n   DE was funded\
    \ by the COSINE PARADISE project, and DE is used as the\n   PARADISE public access\
    \ dua. You can test the software by telnet to\n   directory.ja.net and logging\
    \ in as dua -- no password required.\n"

  - "ABSTRACT\n   The Digital X.500 Directory Services product set includes a directory\n\
    \   server product and a variety directory user agents, as well as a\n   directory\
    \ synchronizer utility.\n   The Digital X.500 Directory Server product provides\
    \ a high\n   performance DSA implemented according to the 1993 edition of the\n\
    \   standard. The InfoBroker Server product extends this to provide the\n   server\
    \ component for LDAP and WWW user agents.  Features of these\n   servers include:\n\
    \         * Integrated multi-protocol support allowing concurrent DAP,\n     \
    \      DSP, DISP and DOP access over OSI and TCP/IP (using [RFC\n           1006])\
    \ protocols.\n         * Indexed database (DIB) to support high-performance searching\n\
    \           and sophisticated matching including approximate match.\n        \
    \ * A DIB based on the 1993 edition Extended Information Models.\n         * Support\
    \ for chaining and referrals in support of a\n           distributed DIB\n   \
    \      * Support for the 1993 edition Basic Access Control scheme.\n         *\
    \ Configurable schema based on the 1993 edition (including\n           attributes,\
    \ object classes, structure rules, name forms).\n         * Support for 1993 edition\
    \ Shadowing using the DISP and DOP\n           protocol, including both incremental\
    \ and on-change features\n           for high performance.\n         * Remote\
    \ management to control DSAs and log significant events.\n         * Support for\
    \ the LDAP protocols using the InfoBroker Server\n           product across either\
    \ TCP/IP  or DECnet transport protocols.\n         * A Look-up Daemon that accepts\
    \ requests from Web Browsers,\n           allowing access to the directory from\
    \ any web browser.\n         * Both X/OPEN XDS/XOM and LDAP APIs.\n         *\
    \ An award winning documentation set.\n   The Digital X.500 Administration Facility,\
    \ X.500 Information Manager\n   and InfoBroker Client products provide MS-Windows,\
    \ Motif and command\n   line interfaces to access and manage the information stored\
    \ in the\n   X.500 directory, including:\n         * Support for different ways\
    \ of accessing the directory, either\n           by browsing or searching based\
    \ on an  extensible set of\n           filters.\n         * Support for bulk load,\
    \ unload and reload of entries.\n         * Driven off the same configurable schema\
    \ information as the\n           DSA allowing extensibility of window layouts\
    \ and text to\n           support customer-defined object classes and attributes.\n\
    \   The Synchronizer-500 is an X.500 DUA which:\n   * Enables bi-directional synchronization\
    \ between X.500 and\n     virtually ANY other non-X.500 directory facilitating\
    \ common\n     management.\n   * Maps incoming data into X.500 using flexible\
    \ configuration\n     files\n   * Facilitates creation of a multivendor electronic\
    \ mail\n     database, creating addresses in the appropriate syntax for\n    \
    \ any mail system.\n   * Provides uniqueness checking on mnemonic O/R addresses,\n\
    \     preventing address duplication\n"

  - "ABSTRACT\n   DIR.X V4.0 is Siemens Nixdorf's Directory Service product compliant\n\
    \   with the 1993 ITU-T X.500 recommendations. The implementation\n   incorporates\
    \ SNI's experience of 10 years development, support and\n   maintenance of the\
    \ DIR.X products conformant to the 1988 Directory\n   Standards, and has the following\
    \ main features:\n      * It conforms to the 1993 Directory standards, with particular\n\
    \        emphasis on the requirements for interoperability with other\n      \
    \  X.500 implementations\n      * The implementation is scaleable: it handles\
    \ small-scale\n        workgroup directories as well as very large directories\
    \ for\n        backbone solutions in large organisations\n      * The implementation\
    \ is extensible: new functionality can\n        easily be incorporated\n     \
    \ * Existing databases and proprietary directory services can be\n        accessed\
    \ or integrated with the implementation.\n      * Particular emphasis is placed\
    \ on ease of administration of\n        the Directory Service a service based\
    \ on DIR.X V4.0 can be\n        administered effectively from a central site,\
    \ including the\n        management of configuration and monitoring options\n\
    \      * The implementation has a high throughput performing well not\n      \
    \  only on small systems, but also on high-performance backend\n        servers,\
    \ handling hundreds of requests in parallel on a\n        multiprocessor machine.\n\

- title: ABSTRACT
  contents:
  - "ABSTRACT\n   DIR.X-SYNC V2.0 enables the synchronization of existing e-mail\n\
    \   address directories in the X.500-based DIR.X directory service. The\n   standard\
    \ DIR.X, DIR.X-SYNC and DIR.D (all available from Siemens\n   Nixdorf) products\
    \ are the foundations on which the corporate\n   directory solutions can be tailored\
    \ to meet the customer's needs. The\n   corporate directory then becomes the universal\
    \ information system\n   within the company.\n   The user can access corporate\
    \ directory information in different\n   ways:\n      * Using DIR.D, SNI's Windows\
    \ client for the X.500 service, PC\n        users can gain easy access to the\
    \ DIR.X server containing the\n        corporate directory data. The data found\
    \ can  be transferred\n        to other applications by means of DDE, drag and\
    \ drop or cut\n        and paste. (See DIR.D V2.6 for further information).\n\
    \      * Query by mail: Authorized users can access data stored in the\n     \
    \   central or distributed directory system over their own mail\n        system.\
    \ DIR.X-SYNC retrieves the inquiry transmitted by mail\n        and directs it\
    \ on to the X.500 service. The search results\n        are then delivered back\
    \ to the user by mail. Using a WWW\n        interface based on TCL scripts\n \
    \  Query by mail does not require additional software on the end system.\n   Each\
    \ mail system connected to the X.400 backbone (e.g. MS-Mail,\n   cc:Mail etc.)\
    \ can use this function. DIR.X-SYNC currently supports\n   the address formats\
    \ of the following e-mail systems:\n      * MAIL.X-OD V2.3\n      * MAIL.2000\
    \ V1.2, AKOM\n      * MS-Mail\n      * cc:Mail\n      * Intelligent Messaging\
    \ Mail (Banyan)\n   The standardized ISO-10021 interface for X.400 addresses is\n\
    \   supported, enabling need for extension. This means that any type of\n   system\
    \ capable of generating this format (e.g. WordPerfect, Lotus\n   Notes) can be\
    \ connected. Address acknowledgment is carried out in ISO\n   format.\n   Functions\
    \ for the administrator:\n      * Export: Addresses can be exported from local\
    \ directories.\n        They are delivered as mail messages in ASCII format to\
    \ the\n        DIR.X-SYNC server.\n      * Upload: The upload server stores the\
    \ exported local addresses\n        in DIR.X as globally valid X.400 addresses.\n\
    \      * Query by Mail: DIR.X-SYNC enables mail members to send a\n        search\
    \ to the DIR.X-SYNC server by e-mail. Using this\n        function, authorized\
    \ administrators of the synchronized\n        directories can acquire copies of\
    \ the corporate directory\n        data.\n      * Administration of the DIR.X-SYNC\
    \ server with an\n        administration tool which can be used via command line\
    \ or a\n        command file.\n   Other features include:\n      * Replication\
    \ and distribution: In addition to the central\n        solution with a single\
    \ corporate directory server, DIR.X-SYNC\n        also supports replicated or\
    \ distributed data storage in\n        DIR.X-SYNC server.\n      * Authentication/Authorization:\
    \ To prevent unauthorized use of\n        the corporate directory system, the\
    \ O/R addresses of the\n        authorized administrators and users are configured\
    \ by the\n        DIR.X-SYNC administrator. When a query by mail or an update\n\
    \        arrives, the sender address is compared with this address.\n      * Logging:\
    \ In the case of error, e.g. incorrect file format,\n        the sender (and the\
    \ administrator  configurable) are informed\n        of the fault by mail. At\

- title: ABSTRACT
  contents:
  - "ABSTRACT\n   Forum LOOK'UP (tm) is a Corporate directory solution based on the\n\
    \   X.500 recommendations. It includes:\n      * a Directory System Agent (DSA),\n\
    \      * Directory User Agents (DUAs).\n      * local network connections\n  \
    \    * remote workstation access\n      * a WEB and videotex access\n      * data\
    \  updating tools\n      * a directory editing tool\n   Forum LOOK'UP is a product\
    \ based on PIZARRO, the research prototype\n   developed at INRIA by Christian\
    \ Huitema's team, and commercialized by\n   Telis, a member of the France Telecom\
    \ group.\n   Characteristics of the DSA are:\n      * The DAP and DSP protocols\
    \ are provided conformant with X.500\n        (88).\n      * The DIB is maintained\
    \ in ASN.1 encoded format in the Unix\n        file system.\n      * Utilities\
    \ are provided to load and dump the DIB from and to\n        ASCII text files.\n\
    \      * As an option, an ORACLE V7 database can also be used.\n      * The DIT\
    \ structure is held in main memory. Frequently used\n        attributes may be\
    \ held in inverted tables in memory to speed\n        up searches.\n      * Knowledge\
    \ management: knowledge on managed domains is stored\n        in Forum LOOK'UP\
    \ specific attributes of the DSA entries.\n      * Schema: The X.500 (88), X.400\
    \ (88) and most of the Cosine and\n        Internet Schema are supported. Object\
    \ class and attribute\n        definitions are enforced. Users may define their\
    \ own.\n      * Simple authentication is provided strong authentication and\n\
    \        signed operations have been tested operationally through\n        Telis's\
    \ participation in PASSWORD, a VALUE project with aim\n        to pilot a European\
    \ security infrastructure for network\n        applications.\n      * Access control\
    \ : the DSA offers a mechanism defined by Telis\n        that is functionally\
    \ equivalent to a profile of the X500 '93\n        access control mechanism. The\
    \ mechanism is based on the\n        notion of administrative domains (autonomous\
    \ and semi-\n        autonomous). A domain defines the user groups (categories)\n\
    \        and their access rights (consult, modify) to specified\n        attribute\
    \ types. The access rights are defined in\n        prescriptive and entry ACI\
    \ attributes.\n      * Phonetic searches : administrators may specify a language\n\
    \        (English, French, ...) for a subtree of the DIT. Approximate\n      \
    \  (phonetic) searches will then be carried out in the given\n        language.\
    \ The software loads a rule database to which new\n        languages and new rules\
    \ may be added easily.\n      * Management: a Forum LOOK'UP DSA object has been\
    \ defined to\n        allow operational parameters of the DSA to be managed via\n\
    \        DAP. Forum LOOK'UP conforms to X.500 (88) as specified in\n        poaragraph\
    \ 9 of X.519 Administration tools are provided :\n      * to generate usage statistics\
    \ automatically and distribute\n        these by mail to administrators\n    \
    \  * to replicate subtrees of the DIT to other FORUM LOOK'UP\n        DSAs and\
    \ automatically update shadow copies,\n      * to extract hardcopy listings from\
    \ the database in an Excel\n        compatible format for \"paper\" directories,\
    \ all the\n        management tasks are performed through a GUI (X/Motif).\n \
    \     * The GUI includes a \"dashboard\" for monitoring of servers and\n     \
    \   the hardware they are installed on.\n      * The DUAs include a graphical\
    \ directory browser with powerful\n        search functionality for PCs and Macintosh.\n"

  - "ABSTRACT\n   FX*500 is a core component of Firefoxs product suite for mail,\n\
    \   messaging and directories.\n   FX*500 provides a Directory System Agent (DSA)\
    \ which adheres to the\n   latest 1993 X.500 standards.\n   FX*500 may be used\
    \ in conjunction with the Firefox FX*400 messaging\n   products or may be combined\
    \ with a range of Directory User Agent and\n   Gateway products in order to satisfy\
    \ a broad range of directory\n   requirements.\n   FX*500 affords unique integration\
    \ opportunities with Novell's NetWare\n   Directory Service (NDS) by offering\
    \ the option of true dynamic\n   directory integration between NDS and X.500.\n\
    \   FX*500 provides support for key features of the X.500 1993 standard\n   while\
    \ continuing to support interworking with 1988 based directory\n   user agents\
    \ and system agents. The main 1993 features of X.500\n   supported by FX*500 are:\n\
    \      * Basic Access Control\n      * The 1993 DSA Information Model\n      *\
    \ Replication and Shadowing\n   In summary, FX*500 supports:\n      * 1988 and\
    \ 1993 X.500 Directory Access Protocol (DAP)\n      * 1988 and 1993 X.500 Directory\
    \ System Protocol (DSP)\n      * 1993 X.500 Directory Information Shadowing Protocol\
    \ (DISP)\n      * 1993 Basic (or Simplified) Access Control\n      * the Lightweight\
    \ Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), as defined\n        by [RFC 1777]\n      *\
    \ configuration of knowledge information for distributed\n        operation using\
    \ 1993 operational attributes\n      * local management services, including a\
    \ knowledge\n        configuration application and extensive diagnostic facilities\n\
    \      * an extended set of management applications\n      * operation in a wide\
    \ variety of network environments including\n        connectivity over X.25, TCP/IP\
    \ [RFC 1006] and OSI LANs.\n      * an application developer's toolkit\n   The\
    \ optional application developer's toolkit includes:\n      * the X/Open Directory\
    \ Services (XDS) API to support directory\n        user agent applications\n \
    \     * a Gateway (G-XDS) API which is based on a simplified version\n       \
    \ of the XDS API syntax and allows developers to implement\n        gateways to\
    \ existing/ proprietary directory databases\n      * a Network Management Interface\
    \ (NMI) to support management\n        applications and integration with management\
    \ services.\n   FX*500 is delivered with a schema defined to support the Common\
    \ Use\n   and MHS (X.402) Schemas defined by UK GOSIP V4. The subschema for\n\
    \   FX*500 can be modified by the customer and updated dynamically.\n   FX*500\
    \ provides for search optimisation by supporting keyed search\n   whereby specific\
    \ attributes can be identified as 'keyed' through\n   local configuration data.\
    \ This optimisation avoids the need to do a\n   \"brute force\" search which requires\
    \ a traversal of all the nodes of a\n   subtree. Approximate match search filters\
    \ are also supported by using\n   a phonetic search based on the \"Soundex\" algorithm.\n"

    \ service, or to provide lightweight access to the\n   X.500 directory.  LDAP\
    \ is defined by [RFC 1777] and [RFC 1778].\n   The UM-LDAP package includes the\
    \ following components:\n      * slapd - a stand-alone LDAP directory server\n\
    \      * slurpd - a stand-alone LDAP replication server\n      * ldapd - an LDAP-to-X.500\

- title: ABSTRACT
  contents:
  - "ABSTRACT\n   The Tandem NonStop Directory Services (NSDS) product provides a\n\
    \   distributed open directory service on Tandem platforms.  It is an\n   industrial\
    \ strength implementation incorporating the Tandem product\n   fundementals of\
    \ resilience, linear extensibility, fault-tolerance, and\n   continuous availability.\
    \ NSDS runs on the NonStop Kernel Guardian\n   Personality which includes support\
    \ for Tandem system characteristics\n   such as data integrity, process persistence,\
    \ and server classes.  NSDS\n   supports access over X.25 WAN, LAN and TCP/IP\
    \ networks.\n   NSDS is a port of OSF's DCE GDS Reference Implementation, with\
    \ Tandem\n   enhancements including 1993 X.500 Simplified Access Control. Tandem\n\
    \   server class management provides fault events, tracing, accounting and\n \
    \  configuration services for NSDS. TM/MP (Transaction Management) is\n   used\
    \ to protect all file operations that affect the integrity of the\n   directory\
    \ entries in the DIB.\n   Major Features Include:\n      * X/Open Directory Services\
    \ (XDS) API and X/Open Object\n        Management (XOM) interface in conformance\
    \ with X/Open CAE\n        Specifications, and an additional Tandem extension\
    \ package\n      * 1988 Edition X.500 Conformant DAP and DSP, capable of inter-\n\
    \        operating with 1993 Edition DUA or DSA implementations\n      * Simplified\
    \ Access Control as specified in the 1993 edition of\n        the X.500 standard.\n\
    \      * Unprotected Simple Authentication (name and password in\n        clear)\n\
    \      * Character set support for T61 Printables, IA5 and Teletex\n        Strings\n\
    \      * The DSA-SC server class performs the functions of a DSA.\n        Multiple\
    \ processes are used for fault tolerance and load\n        balancing.\n      *\
    \ The DUA-ACCESS server class handles communications between\n        local applications\
    \ and remote DSA's using DAP across an OSI\n        stack.\n      * The DSA-ACCESS\
    \ server class handles communications from\n        remote DUAs or DSAs to the\
    \ DSA-SC server class using the\n        Tandem OSI stack implementation which\
    \ includes [RFC 1006]\n        support for TCP/IP networks.\n      * The DSA-CHAIN\
    \ server class handles chaining communications\n        between the DSA-SC server\
    \ class and remote DSAs.\n      * NSDS GUI Viewer supports administration/management\
    \ of an NSDS\n        DIB on a PC Windows workstation.  The NSDS GUI Viewer is\n\
    \        supported by a persistent server process on the Tandem\n        NonStop\
    \ Kernel.  The  GUI Viewer allows a directory entry and\n        a complete set\
    \ of attributes and values to be inserted\n        anywhere in the directory tree\
    \ (DIT), to be deleted or\n        changed, read or searched based on distinguished\
    \ name\n        components, with or without wild-card.\n      * NSDS SCRIPTOR\
    \ allows customers to explore features of the XDS\n        programmatic interface\
    \ in advance of writing their XOM/XDS\n        application. NSDS SCRIPTOR is a\
    \ menu-driven batch interface\n        to XDS functions.\n      * A BulkUnload/BulkLoad\
    \ utility allows a branch of the DIB to\n        be dumped to an editable flat\
    \ file and restored from that\n        file.  The flat file can be modified before\
    \ being bulk-loaded\n        into a DIB which may conform to a different schema\n\
    \        definition.\n      * Support for the LDAP protocol.\n      * Messaging-Based\
    \ Directory Query (MDQ) provides a text-based\n        query interface to the\
    \ directory from an X.400 messaging\n        system, such as Tandem OSI/MHS, via\
    \ the XAPIA compliant GPI\n        interface.\n"

- title: ABSTRACT
  contents:
  - "ABSTRACT\n   PMDF-X500 is Innosoft's implementation of the X.500 standards for\n\
    \   Directory Services. PMDF-X500 is based upon the ISODE Consortium\n   code-base.\
    \ The core of PMDF-X500 is the Directory System Agent (DSA)\n   server. This server\
    \ provides directory information to Directory User\n   Agents (DUA) using either\
    \ OSI or TCP/IP networking protocols. Since\n   PMDF-X500 is based on a widely\
    \ used implementation, it interoperates\n   particularly well with a whole host\
    \ of X.500-based products from other\n   sources.\n   In order to facilitate initial\
    \ loading of directory data as well as\n   ongoing coordination with other directory\
    \ services, PMDF-X500 includes\n   tools to import from and export directory information\
    \ to Entry\n   Description File (EDF) files. EDF files are flat text files.\n\
    \   PMDF-X500 provides directory coordination functions using EDF files\n   for\
    \ the following directories:\n      * X.500 DSAs supporting LDAP access\n    \
    \  * cc:Mail\n      * Digital's DDS\n      * GroupWise\n      * Microsoft Mail\n\

- title: CONFORMANCE WITH PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS
  contents:
  - "CONFORMANCE WITH PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS\n   PMDF-X500 supports DAP and DSP\
    \ accesses using Internet protocols as\n   specified in [RFC 1006]. In addition,\
    \ the Internet community has\n   proposed two lightweight alternatives to DAP\
    \ called Lightweight\n   Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), which is specified\
    \ in [RFC 1777],\n   and Connectionless Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\
    \ (CLDAP),\n   which is specified in [RFC 1798]. LDAP and CLDAP, which are currently\n\
    \   specified to run over TCP/IP, are much simpler protocols than DAP and\n  \
    \ were designed to reduce the cost of entry associated with using X.500\n   protocols\
    \ in client applications. PMDF-X500 includes both LDAP and\n   CLDAP servers.\n\
    \   The LDAP server accesses X.500 directory information using DAP to\n   communicate\
    \ with X.500 DSAs. PMDF-X500 provides an LDAP server which\n   translates LDAP\
    \ requests into DAP requests to communicate with X.500\n   DSAs. CLDAP defines\
    \ a very low overhead method for accessing X.500\n   directory information. CLDAP\
    \ is suitable for providing access to\n   information that does not require access\
    \ controls.\n"

- title: ABSTRACT
  contents:
  - "ABSTRACT\n   X500-DS and X500-DUA are integral part of the large Bull OSI offer.\n\
    \   Although based on the DCE/GDS (Distributed Computing\n   Environment/Global\
    \ Directory Service) of OSF, those two products may\n   be installed and used\
    \ without the DCE environment. Some enhancements\n   have been added for the user\
    \ and the management facilities. X500-DS is\n   designed to implement both the\
    \ DUA and the DSA functions, whilst\n   X500-DUA only provides the DUA functions.\n\
    \   The X500-DUA package contains:\n      * The standards APIs XOM (X/Open OSI-Abstract-Data\
    \ Manipulation\n        API) and XDS (X/Open Directory Service API) for the\n\
    \        development of portable applications,\n      * A core DUA to translate\
    \ all user's requests (bind, read,\n        list, compare, modify, modifyRDN,\
    \ search, add, remove, unbind\n        ...) into the DAP protocol used for communication\
    \ with\n        distant DSAs,\n      * The OSI standard high layers (ASN.1, ROSE,\
    \ ACSE, Presentation\n        and Session) for communication with the distant\
    \ DSAs. The\n        interface with the low layers is XTI. [RFC 1006] is supported\n\
    \        under XTI or the OSI Session,\n      * A DUA Cache to improve performances\
    \ when accessing remote\n        DSAs,\n      * A powerful management application\
    \ facilitating the\n        configuration of the product and controlling the operations,\n\
    \        logs and traces,\n      * A user application for the manipulations of\
    \ the database\n        entries,\n      * A generic tool to load and unload ASCII\
    \ and binary files\n        in/from distributed DSAs,\n      * The support of\
    \ the LDAP [RFC 1777] thanks to an LDAP Server,\n      * A DUA Server that allows\
    \ to use A-Window-To-Directory (refer\n        to this DUA product description)\
    \ on a PC.\n   The X500-DS package contains:\n      * All components of the X500-DUA,\n\
    \      * A core DSA to process all requests received from distant DUAs\n     \
    \   through DAP protocol or from distant DSAs through DSP\n        protocol,\n\
    \      * The support of the referral, chained and multi-casting modes\n      \
    \  of operation, access control lists and management of\n        knowledge information\
    \ (for distribution, shadows and  copies\n        of sub-trees),\n      * The\
    \ support of the simple authentication and of the DCE\n        authentication,\n\
    \      * A management application for managing the schema information\n      \
    \  (creation, deletion and modification of object classes and of\n        attribute\
    \ types, management of the rules of the DIT).\n      * A C-ISAM database that\
    \ is specially designed for high\n        performances: e.g. less than 10 ms to\
    \ read an entry on an\n        Escala at the XOM/XDS interface.\n   These two\
    \ products are easely installed, configured and administered\n   thanks to the\
    \ System Management Interface Tool (SMIT) screens of AIX.\n"

    \ XDS and XOM\n   interface libraries are also provided. When the product is installed\n\
    \   with the DCE environment, XDS and XOM interfaces are also used to\n   access\
    \ DCE/CDS (Local Cell Directory Service) transparently. A GDA\n   (Global Directory\
