  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines a set of extensions that instrument RADIUS\n \
    \  authentication client functions.  These extensions represent a\n   portion\
    \ of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network\n   management\
    \ protocols in the Internet community.  Using these\n   extensions, IP-based management\
    \ stations can manage RADIUS\n   authentication clients.\n   This memo obsoletes\
    \ RFC 2618 by deprecating the MIB table containing\n   IPv4-only address formats\
    \ and defining a new table to add support for\n   version-neutral IP address formats.\
    \  The remaining MIB objects from\n   RFC 2618 are carried forward into this document.\
    \  The memo also adds\n   UNITS and REFERENCE clauses to selected objects.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information\

- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [RFC2119].\n   This document uses terminology from RFC 2865 [RFC2865].\n\
    \   This document uses the word \"malformed\" with respect to RADIUS\n   packets,\
    \ particularly in the context of counters of \"malformed\n   packets\".  While\
    \ RFC 2865 does not provide an explicit definition of\n   \"malformed\", malformed\
    \ generally means that the implementation has\n   determined the packet does not\
    \ match the format defined in RFC 2865.\n   Some implementations may determine\
    \ that packets are malformed when\n   the Vendor Specific Attribute (VSA) format\
    \ does not follow the RFC\n   2865 recommendations for VSAs.  Those implementations\
    \ are used in\n   deployments today, and thus set the de facto definition of\n\
    \   \"malformed\".\n"
- title: 3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework
  contents:
  - "3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of\
    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\
    \ please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are\
    \ accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information\
    \ Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network\
    \ Management Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms\
    \ defined in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies\
    \ a MIB\n   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n\
    \   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"
- title: 4.  Scope of Changes
  contents:
  - "4.  Scope of Changes\n   This document obsoletes RFC 2618 [RFC2618], RADIUS Authentication\n\
    \   Client MIB, by deprecating the radiusAuthServerTable table and adding\n  \
    \ a new table, radiusAuthServerExtTable, containing\n   radiusAuthServerInetAddressType,\
    \ radiusAuthServerInetAddress, and\n   radiusAuthClientServerInetPortNumber. \
    \ The purpose of these added MIB\n   objects is to support version-neutral IP\
    \ addressing formats.  The\n   existing table containing radiusAuthServerAddress\
    \ and\n   radiusAuthClientServerPortNumber is deprecated.  The remaining MIB\n\
    \   objects are carried forward from RFC 2618 into this document.  This\n   memo\
    \ also adds UNITS and REFERENCE clauses to selected objects.\n   RFC 4001 [RFC4001],\
    \ which defines the SMI Textual Conventions for\n   IPv6 addresses, contains the\
    \ following recommendation.\n   'In particular, when revising a MIB module that\
    \ contains IPv4\n   specific tables, it is suggested to define new tables using\
    \ the\n   textual conventions defined in this memo [RFC4001] that support all\n\
    \   versions of IP.  The status of the new tables SHOULD be \"current\",\n   whereas\
    \ the status of the old IP version specific tables SHOULD be\n   changed to \"\
    deprecated\".  The other approach, of having multiple\n   similar tables for different\
    \ IP versions, is strongly discouraged.'\n"
- title: 5.  Structure of the MIB Module
  contents:
  - "5.  Structure of the MIB Module\n   The RADIUS authentication protocol, described\
    \ in RFC 2865 [RFC2865],\n   distinguishes between the client function and the\
    \ server function.\n   In RADIUS authentication, clients send Access-Requests,\
    \ and servers\n   reply with Access-Accepts, Access-Rejects, and Access-Challenges.\n\
    \   Typically, Network Access Server (NAS) devices implement the client\n   function,\
    \ and thus would be expected to implement the RADIUS\n   authentication client\
    \ MIB, while RADIUS authentication servers\n   implement the server function,\
    \ and thus would be expected to\n   implement the RADIUS authentication server\
    \ MIB.\n   However, it is possible for a RADIUS authentication entity to perform\n\
    \   both client and server functions.  For example, a RADIUS proxy may\n   act\
    \ as a server to one or more RADIUS authentication clients, while\n   simultaneously\
    \ acting as an authentication client to one or more\n   authentication servers.\
    \  In such situations, it is expected that\n   RADIUS entities combining client\
    \ and server functionality will\n   support both the client and server MIBs. \
    \ The client MIB is defined\n   in this document, and the server MIB is defined\
    \ in [RFC4669].\n   This MIB module contains two scalars as well as a single table,\
    \ the\n   RADIUS Authentication Server Table, which contains one row for each\n\
    \   RADIUS authentication server with which the client shares a secret.\n   Each\
    \ entry in the RADIUS Authentication Server Table includes sixteen\n   columns\
    \ presenting a view of the activity of the RADIUS\n   authentication client.\n\
    \   This MIB imports from [RFC2578], [RFC2580], [RFC3411], and [RFC4001].\n"
- title: 6.  Deprecated Objects
  contents:
  - "6.  Deprecated Objects\n   The deprecated table in this MIB is carried forward\
    \ from RFC 2618\n   [RFC2618].  There are two conditions under which it MAY be\
    \ desirable\n   for managed entities to continue to support the deprecated table:\n\
    \   1.  The managed entity only supports IPv4 address formats.\n   2.  The managed\
    \ entity supports both IPv4 and IPv6 address formats,\n       and the deprecated\
    \ table is supported for backwards compatibility\n       with older management\
    \ stations.  This option SHOULD only be used\n       when the IP addresses in\
    \ the new table are in IPv4 format and can\n       accurately be represented in\
    \ both the new table and the\n       deprecated table.\n   Managed entities SHOULD\
    \ NOT instantiate row entries in the deprecated\n   table, containing IPv4-only\
    \ address objects, when the RADIUS server\n   address represented in such a table\
    \ row is not an IPv4 address.\n   Managed entities SHOULD NOT return inaccurate\
    \ values of IP address or\n   SNMP object access errors for IPv4-only address\
    \ objects in otherwise\n   populated tables.  When row entries exist in both the\
    \ deprecated\n   IPv4-only table and the new IP-version-neutral table that describe\n\
    \   the same RADIUS server, the row indexes SHOULD be the same for the\n   corresponding\
    \ rows in each table, to facilitate correlation of these\n   related rows by management\
    \ applications.\n"

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   There are no management objects defined in this\
    \ MIB that have a MAX-\n   ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So,\
    \ if this MIB is\n   implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder\
    \ can\n   alter or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP\n\
    \   SET operations.\n   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e.,\
    \ objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive\
    \ or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to\n \
    \  control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly\n   to\
    \ even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over\n   the network\
    \ via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n\
    \   radiusAuthServerIPAddress\n      This can be used to determine the address\
    \ of the RADIUS\n      authentication server with which the client is communicating.\n\
    \      This information could be useful in mounting an attack on the\n      authentication\
    \ server.\n   radiusAuthClientServerPortNumber\n      This can be used to determine\
    \ the port number on which the RADIUS\n      authentication client is sending.\
    \  This information could be\n      useful in impersonating the client in order\
    \ to send data to the\n      authentication server.\n   radiusAuthServerInetAddress\n\
    \      This can be used to determine the address of the RADIUS\n      authentication\
    \ server with which the client is communicating.\n      This information could\
    \ be useful in mounting an attack on the\n      authentication server.\n   radiusAuthClientServerInetPortNumber\n\
    \      This can be used to determine the port number on which the RADIUS\n   \
    \   authentication client is sending.  This information could be\n      useful\
    \ in impersonating the client in order to send data to the\n      authentication\
    \ server.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n\
    \   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n   even\
    \ then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is\n   allowed to\
    \ access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n\
    \   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as\n  \
    \ provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full\
    \ support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication and\
    \ privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n\
    \   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable\
    \ cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to\
    \ ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module\
    \ is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals\
    \ (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)\
    \ them.\n"
