  - "1.  Introduction\n   Suppose a host wishes (or is required by policy) to establish\
    \ an\n   IPsec tunnel with some remote entity on the network prior to allowing\n\
    \   normal communication to take place.  In many cases, this end system\n   will\
    \ be able to determine the DNS name for the remote entity (either\n   by having\
    \ the DNS name given explicitly, by performing a DNS PTR\n   query for a particular\
    \ IP address, or through some other means, e.g.,\n   by extracting the DNS portion\
    \ of a \"user@FQDN\" name for a remote\n   entity).  In these cases, the host\
    \ will need to obtain a public key\n   to authenticate the remote entity, and\
    \ may also need some guidance\n   about whether it should contact the entity directly\
    \ or use another\n   node as a gateway to the target entity.  The IPSECKEY RR\
    \ provides a\n   mechanism for storing such information.\n   The type number for\
    \ the IPSECKEY RR is 45.\n   This record replaces the functionality of the sub-type\
    \ #4 of the KEY\n   Resource Record, which has been obsoleted by RFC 3445 [11].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Overview\n   The IPSECKEY resource record (RR) is used to publish a public\
    \ key\n   that is to be associated with a Domain Name System (DNS) [1] name for\n\
    \   use with the IPsec protocol suite.  This can be the public key of a\n   host,\
    \ network, or application (in the case of per-port keying).\n   The key words\
    \ \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\"\
    , \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document\
    \ are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].\n"
- title: 1.2.  Use of DNS Address-to-Name Maps (IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA)
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Use of DNS Address-to-Name Maps (IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA)\n   Often a\
    \ security gateway will only have access to the IP address of\n   the node with\
    \ which communication is desired and will not know any\n   other name for the\
    \ target node.  Because of this, frequently the best\n   way of looking up IPSECKEY\
    \ RRs will be by using the IP address as an\n   index into one of the reverse\
    \ mapping trees (IN-ADDR.ARPA for IPv4 or\n   IP6.ARPA for IPv6).\n   The lookup\
    \ is done in the fashion usual for PTR records.  The IP\n   address' octets (IPv4)\
    \ or nibbles (IPv6) are reversed and looked up\n   with the appropriate suffix.\
    \  Any CNAMEs or DNAMEs found MUST be\n   followed.\n   Note: even when the IPsec\
    \ function is contained in the end-host,\n   often only the application will know\
    \ the forward name used.  Although\n   the case where the application knows the\
    \ forward name is common, the\n   user could easily have typed in a literal IP\
    \ address.  This storage\n   mechanism does not preclude using the forward name\
    \ when it is\n   available but does not require it.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Usage Criteria
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Usage Criteria\n   An IPSECKEY resource record SHOULD be used in combination\
    \ with DNSSEC\n   [8] unless some other means of authenticating the IPSECKEY resource\n\
    \   record is available.\n   It is expected that there will often be multiple\
    \ IPSECKEY resource\n   records at the same name.  This will be due to the presence\
    \ of\n   multiple gateways and a need to roll over keys.\n   This resource record\
    \ is class independent.\n"

- title: 2.6.  RDATA Format - Public Keys
  contents:
  - "2.6.  RDATA Format - Public Keys\n   Both the public key types defined in this\
    \ document (RSA and DSA)\n   inherit their public key formats from the corresponding\
    \ KEY RR\n   formats.  Specifically, the public key field contains the\n   algorithm-specific\
    \ portion of the KEY RR RDATA, which is all the KEY\n   RR DATA after the first\
    \ four octets.  This is the same portion of the\n   KEY RR that must be specified\
    \ by documents that define a DNSSEC\n   algorithm.  Those documents also specify\
    \ a message digest to be used\n   for generation of SIG RRs; that specification\
    \ is not relevant for\n   IPSECKEY RRs.\n   Future algorithms, if they are to\
    \ be used by both DNSSEC (in the KEY\n   RR) and IPSECKEY, are likely to use the\
    \ same public key encodings in\n   both records.  Unless otherwise specified,\
    \ the IPSECKEY public key\n   field will contain the algorithm-specific portion\
    \ of the KEY RR RDATA\n   for the corresponding algorithm.  The algorithm must\
    \ still be\n   designated for use by IPSECKEY, and an IPSECKEY algorithm type\
    \ number\n   (which might be different from the DNSSEC algorithm number) must\
    \ be\n   assigned to it.\n   The DSA key format is defined in RFC 2536 [9]\n \
    \  The RSA key format is defined in RFC 3110 [10], with the following\n   changes:\n\
    \   The earlier definition of RSA/MD5 in RFC 2065 [4] limited the\n   exponent\
    \ and modulus to 2552 bits in length.  RFC 3110 extended that\n   limit to 4096\
    \ bits for RSA/SHA1 keys.  The IPSECKEY RR imposes no\n   length limit on RSA\
    \ public keys, other than the 65535 octet limit\n   imposed by the two-octet length\
    \ encoding.  This length extension is\n   applicable only to IPSECKEY; it is not\
    \ applicable to KEY RRs.\n"

    \ public keying material\n   for use by key management protocols such as ISAKMP/IKE\
    \ (RFC 2407)\n   [7].\n   The IPSECKEY resource record contains information that\
    \ SHOULD be\n   communicated to the end client in an integral fashion; i.e., free\n\
    \   from modification.  The form of this channel is up to the consumer of\n  \
    \ the data; there must be a trust relationship between the end consumer\n   of\
    \ this resource record and the server.  This relationship may be\n   end-to-end\
    \ DNSSEC validation, a TSIG or SIG(0) channel to another\n   secure source, a\
    \ secure local channel on the host, or some\n   combination of the above.\n  \
    \ The keying material provided by the IPSECKEY resource record is not\n   sensitive\
    \ to passive attacks.  The keying material may be freely\n   disclosed to any\
    \ party without any impact on the security properties\n   of the resulting IPsec\
    \ session.  IPsec and IKE provide defense\n   against both active and passive\

    \   MUST carefully document its trust model and why the trust model of\n   DNSSEC\
    \ is appropriate, if that is the secure channel used.\n   An active attack on\
    \ the DNS that caused the wrong IP address to be\n   retrieved (via forged address),\
    \ and therefore the wrong QNAME to be\n   queried, would also result in a man-in-the-middle\

- title: 4.1.1.  Active Attacks Against IPSECKEY Keying Materials
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  Active Attacks Against IPSECKEY Keying Materials\n   The first kind of\
    \ active attack is when the attacker replaces the\n   keying material with either\
    \ a key under its control or with garbage.\n   The gateway field is either untouched\
    \ or is null.  The IKE\n   negotiation will therefore occur with the original\
    \ end-system.  For\n   this attack to succeed, the attacker must perform a man-in-the-middle\n\

    \ replaces the public key or removes\n   it.  If the public key were removed,\
    \ then the attacker could provide\n   an accurate public key of its own in a second\
    \ record.\n   This second form creates a simple man-in-the-middle attacks since\
    \ the\n   attacker can then create a second tunnel to the real destination.\n\

    \ Address/Port Translation (NAT/NAPT) technology.\n   This attack is easier than\
    \ the first one because the attacker does\n   NOT need to be on the end-to-end\
    \ forwarding path.  The attacker need\n   only be able to modify DNS replies.\
    \  This can be done by packet\n   modification, by various kinds of race attacks,\
    \ or through methods\n   that pollute DNS caches.\n   If the end-to-end integrity\
    \ of the IPSECKEY RR is suspect, the end\n   client MUST restrict its use of the\
    \ IPSECKEY RR to cases where the RR\n   owner name matches the content of the\
    \ gateway field.  As the RR owner\n   name is assumed when the gateway field is\
    \ null, a null gateway field\n   is considered a match.\n   Thus, any records\
    \ obtained under unverified conditions (e.g., no\n   DNSSEC or trusted path to\
    \ source) that have a non-null gateway field\n   MUST be ignored.\n   This restriction\
    \ eliminates attacks against the gateway field, which\n   are considered much\
    \ easier, as the attack does not need to be on the\n   forwarding path.\n   In\
    \ the case of an IPSECKEY RR with a value of three in its gateway\n   type field,\
    \ the gateway field contains a domain name.  The subsequent\n   query required\
    \ to translate that name into an IP address or IPSECKEY\n   RR will also be subject\
    \ to man-in-the-middle attacks.  If the\n   end-to-end integrity of this second\
    \ query is suspect, then the\n   provisions above also apply.  The IPSECKEY RR\
    \ MUST be ignored\n   whenever the resulting gateway does not match the QNAME\
    \ of the\n   original IPSECKEY RR query.\n"
