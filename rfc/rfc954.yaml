  - "STATUS OF THIS MEMO\n   This RFC is the official specification of the NICNAME/WHOIS\
    \ protocol.\n   This memo describes the protocol and the service.  This is an\
    \ update\n   of RFC 812.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: INTRODUCTION
  contents:
  - "INTRODUCTION\n   The NICNAME/WHOIS Server is a TCP transaction based query/response\n\
    \   server, running on the SRI-NIC machine (26.0.0.73 or 10.0.0.51), that\n  \
    \ provides netwide directory service to internet users.  It is one of a\n   series\
    \ of internet name services maintained by the DDN Network\n   Information Center\
    \ (NIC) at SRI International on behalf of the\n   Defense Communications Agency\
    \ (DCA).  The server is accessible across\n   the Internet from user programs\
    \ running on local hosts, and it\n   delivers the full name, U.S. mailing address,\
    \ telephone number, and\n   network mailbox for DDN users who are registered in\
    \ the NIC database.\n   This server, together with the corresponding WHOIS Database\
    \ can also\n   deliver online look-up of individuals or their online mailboxes,\n\
    \   network organizations, DDN nodes and associated hosts, and TAC\n   telephone\
    \ numbers.  The service is designed to be user-friendly and\n   the information\
    \ is delivered in human-readable format.  DCA strongly\n   encourages network\
    \ hosts to provide their users with access to this\n   network service.\n"
- title: WHO SHOULD BE IN THE DATABASE
  contents:
  - "WHO SHOULD BE IN THE DATABASE\n   DCA requests that each individual with a directory\
    \ on an ARPANET or\n   MILNET host, who is capable of passing traffic across the\
    \ DoD\n   Internet, be registered in the NIC WHOIS Database.  MILNET TAC users\n\
    \   must be registered in the database.  To register, send via electronic\n  \
    \ mail to REGISTRAR@SRI-NIC.ARPA your full name, middle initial, U.S.\n   mailing\
    \ address (including mail stop and full explanation of\n   abbreviations and acronyms),\
    \ ZIP code, telephone (including Autovon\n   and FTS, if available), and one network\
    \ mailbox.  Contact the DDN\n   Network Information Center, REGISTRAR@SRI-NIC.ARPA\
    \ or (800) 235-3155,\n   for assistance with registration.\n"

- title: PROTOCOL
  contents:
  - "PROTOCOL\n   To access the NICNAME/WHOIS server:\n      Connect to the SRI-NIC\
    \ service host at TCP service port 43\n      (decimal).\n      Send a single \"\
    command line\", ending with <CRLF> (ASCII CR and\n      LF).\n      Receive information\
    \ in response to the command line.  The server\n      closes its connection as\
    \ soon as the output is finished.\n"
- title: EXISTING USER PROGRAMS
  contents:
  - "EXISTING USER PROGRAMS\n   NICNAME is the global name for the user program, although\
    \ many sites\n   have chosen to use the more familiar name of \"WHOIS\".  There\
    \ are\n   versions of the NICNAME user program for TENEX, TOPS-20, and UNIX.\n\
    \   The TENEX and TOPS-20 programs are written in assembly language\n   (FAIL/MACRO),\
    \ and the UNIX version is written in C. They are easy to\n   invoke, taking one\
    \ argument which is passed directly to the NICNAME\n   server at SRI-NIC.  Contact\
    \ NIC@SRI-NIC.ARPA for copies of the\n   program.\n"
- title: COMMAND LINES AND REPLIES
  contents:
  - "COMMAND LINES AND REPLIES\n   A command line is normally a single name specification.\
    \  Note that\n   the specification formats will evolve with time; the best way\
    \ to\n   obtain the most recent documentation on name specifications is to\n \
    \  give the server a command line consisting of \"?<CRLF>\" (that is, a\n   question-mark\
    \ alone as the name specification).  The response from\n   the NICNAME server\
    \ will list all possible formats that can be used.\n   The responses are not currently\
    \ intended to be machine-readable; the\n   information is meant to be passed back\
    \ directly to a human user.  The\n   following three examples illustrate the use\
    \ of NICNAME as of October\n   1985.\n   ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \      Command line: ?\n      Response:\n      Please enter a name or a NIC handle,\
    \ such as \"Smith\" or \"SRI-NIC\".\n      Starting with a period forces a name-only\
    \ search; starting with\n      exclamation point forces handle-only.  Examples:\n"
