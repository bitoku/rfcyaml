  - "2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of
    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].  Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual\n   information store, termed the Management Information Base or
    MIB.\n   MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network\n   Management
    Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the\n   mechanisms defined
    in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).\n   This memo specifies a MIB
    module that is compliant to the SMIv2,\n   which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
    [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579\n   [RFC2579], and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].\n"
  title: 2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework
- contents:
  - "3.  Overview\n   The objects defined in this document are used to monitor the
    RPKI-\n   Router Protocol [RFC6810].  The MIB module defined here is broken\n
    \  into these tables: the RPKI-Router Cache Server (Connection) Table,\n   the
    RPKI-Router Cache Server Errors Table, and the RPKI-Router Prefix\n   Origin Table.\n
    \  The RPKI-Router Cache Server Table contains information about the\n   state
    and current activity of connections with the RPKI-router cache\n   servers.  It
    also contains counters for the number of messages\n   received and sent, plus
    the number of announcements, withdrawals, and\n   active records.  The RPKI-Router
    Cache Server Errors Table contains\n   counters of occurrences of errors on the
    connections (if any).  The\n   RPKI-Router Prefix Origin Table contains IP prefixes
    with their\n   minimum and maximum prefix lengths and the Origin Autonomous System\n
    \  (AS).  This data is the collective set of information received from\n   all
    RPKI cache servers that the router is connected with.  The cache\n   servers are
    running the RPKI-Router Protocol.\n   Two notifications have been defined to inform
    a Network Management\n   Station (NMS) or operators about changes in the connection
    state of\n   the connections listed in the RPKI-Router Cache Server (Connection)\n
    \  Table.\n"

    \  [RFC2579], [RFC2580], [RFC4001], and [RFC2287].  That means we have a\n   normative
    reference to each of those documents.\n   The MIB module also has a normative
    reference to the RPKI-Router\n   Protocol [RFC6810].  Furthermore, for background

  title: 5.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   There are no management objects defined in this
    MIB module that have\n   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
    \ So, if this\n   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that
    an\n   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB\n   module
    via direct SNMP SET operations.\n   Most of the readable objects in this MIB module
    (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered
    sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.  They are vulnerable
    in the\n   sense that when an intruder sees the information in this MIB module,\n
    \  then it might help him/her to set up an attack on the router or cache\n   server.
    \ It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY\n   access to these objects
    and possibly to even encrypt the values of\n   these objects when sending them
    over the network via SNMP.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate
    security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n
    \  there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to\n   access
    and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this\n   MIB module.\n
    \  Implementations MUST provide the security features described by the\n   SNMPv3
    framework (see [RFC3410]), including full support for\n   authentication and privacy
    via the User-based Security Model (USM)\n   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm
    [RFC3826].  Implementations\n   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security
    Model (TSM)\n   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH\n
    \  [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior
    to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3
    and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility
    to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module
    is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals
    (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)
    them.\n"
