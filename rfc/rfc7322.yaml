- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The ultimate goal of the RFC publication process is to produce\n\
    \   documents that are readable, clear, consistent, and reasonably\n   uniform.\
    \  The basic formatting conventions for RFCs were established\n   in the 1970s\
    \ by the original RFC Editor, Jon Postel.  This document\n   describes the fundamental\
    \ and unique style conventions and editorial\n   policies currently in use for\
    \ the RFC Series [RFC4844].  It is\n   intended as a stable, infrequently updated\
    \ reference for authors,\n   editors, and reviewers.\n   The RFC Editor also maintains\
    \ a web portion of the Style Guide (see\n   Appendix A.3) that describes issues\
    \ as they are raised and indicates\n   how the RFC Editor intends to address them.\
    \  As new style issues\n   arise, the RFC Editor will first address them on the\
    \ web portion of\n   the Style Guide [STYLE-WEB].  These topics may become part\
    \ of the RFC\n   Style Guide when it is revised.\n   The world of technical publishing\
    \ has generally accepted rules for\n   grammar, punctuation, capitalization, sentence\
    \ length and complexity,\n   parallelism, etc.  The RFC Editor generally follows\
    \ these accepted\n   rules as defined by the Chicago Manual of Style (CMOS) [CMOS],\
    \ with a\n   few important exceptions to avoid ambiguity in complex technical\n\
    \   prose and to handle mixtures of text and computer languages, or to\n   preserve\
    \ historical formatting rules.  This document presents these\n   exceptions as\
    \ applied or recommended by the RFC Editor.\n   All RFCs begin as Internet-Drafts\
    \ (also referred to as I-Ds), and a\n   well-written and properly constructed\
    \ Internet-Draft [ID-GUIDE]\n   provides a strong basis for a good RFC.  The RFC\
    \ Editor accepts\n   Internet-Drafts from specified streams for publication [RFC4844]\
    \ and\n   applies the rules and guidelines for the RFC Series during the\n   editorial\
    \ process.\n"
- title: 2.  RFC Editor's Philosophy
  contents:
  - "2.  RFC Editor's Philosophy\n   Authors may find it helpful to understand the\
    \ RFC Editor's goals\n   during the publication process, namely to:\n      - Prepare\
    \ the document according to RFC style and format.\n      - Make the document as\
    \ clear, consistent, and readable as\n        possible.\n      - Correct larger\
    \ content/clarity issues; flag any unclear passages\n        for author review.\n\
    \      - Fix inconsistencies (e.g., terms that appear in various forms,\n    \
    \    text that appears multiple times, or inconsistent\n        capitalization).\n\
    \   We strive for consistency within:\n      a. the document,\n      b. a cluster\
    \ of documents [CLUSTER], and\n      c. the series of RFCs on the subject matter.\n\
    \   The editorial process of the RFC Editor is not an additional\n   technical\
    \ review of the document.  Where the RFC Editor may suggest\n   changes in wording\
    \ for clarity and readability, it is up to the\n   author, working group, or stream-approving\
    \ body to determine whether\n   the changes have an impact on the technical meaning\
    \ of the document\n   [RFC4844].  If the original wording is a more accurate representation\n\
    \   of the technical content being described in the document, it takes\n   precedence\
    \ over editorial conventions.\n   The activity of editing sometimes creates a\
    \ tension between author\n   and editor.  The RFC Editor attempts to minimize\
    \ this conflict for\n   RFC publication while continually striving to produce\
    \ a uniformly\n   excellent document series.  The RFC Editor refers to this fundamental\n\
    \   tension as \"editorial balance,\" and maintaining this balance is a\n   continuing\
    \ concern for the RFC Editor.  There is a prime directive\n   that must rule over\
    \ grammatical conventions: do not change the\n   intended meaning of the text.\n\
    \   If the RFC Editor cannot edit a document without serious risk of\n   altering\
    \ the meaning, it may be returned to the stream-approving body\n   for review.\
    \  See Appendix A.2 for more information.\n"
- title: 3.  RFC Style Conventions
  contents:
  - "3.  RFC Style Conventions\n   This Style Guide does not use terminology as defined\
    \ in RFC 2119\n   [BCP14].  In this document, lowercase use of \"must\" and \"\
    should\"\n   indicates changes the RFC Editor will make automatically to conform\n\
    \   with this Style Guide versus those that may be questioned if not\n   applied.\
    \  The lowercase \"must\" indicates those changes that will be\n   applied automatically\
    \ and are not at the discretion of the authors.\n   The lowercase \"should\" indicates\
    \ the RFC Editor's recommended use,\n   but conformance with the recommendations\
    \ is not required; the RFC\n   Editor may question whether the guidance may be\
    \ applied.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Language
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Language\n   The RFC publication language is English.  Spelling may be\
    \ either\n   American or British, as long as an individual document is internally\n\
    \   consistent.  Where both American and British English spelling are\n   used\
    \ within a document or cluster of documents, the text will be\n   modified to\
    \ be consistent with American English spelling.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Punctuation
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Punctuation\n   *  No overstriking (or underlining) is allowed.\n   * \
    \ When a sentence ended by a period is immediately followed by\n      another\
    \ sentence, there must be two blank spaces after the period.\n   *  A comma is\
    \ used before the last item of a series, e.g.,\n         \"TCP service is reliable,\
    \ ordered, and full duplex\"\n   *  When quoting literal text, punctuation is\
    \ placed outside quotation\n      marks, e.g.,\n         Search for the string\
    \ \"Error Found\".\n      When quoting general text, such as general text from\
    \ another RFC,\n      punctuation may be included within the quotation marks,\
    \ e.g.,\n         RFC 4844 indicates that \"RFCs are available free of charge\
    \ to\n         anyone via the Internet.\"\n      Quotation marks are not necessary\
    \ when text is formatted as a\n      block quotation.\n"
- title: 3.3.  DNS Names and URIs
  contents:
  - "3.3.  DNS Names and URIs\n   DNS names, whether or not in URIs, that are used\
    \ as generic examples\n   in RFCs should use the particular examples defined in\
    \ \"Reserved Top\n   Level DNS Names\" [BCP32], to avoid accidental conflicts.\n\
    \   Angle brackets are strongly recommended around URIs [STD66], e.g.,\n     \
    \ <http://example.com/>\n"
- title: 3.4.  Capitalization
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Capitalization\n   *  Capitalization must be consistent within the document\
    \ and ideally\n      should be consistent with related RFCs.  Refer to the online\
    \ table\n      of decisions on consistent usage of terms in RFCs [TERMS].\n  \
    \ *  Per CMOS guidelines, the major words in RFC titles and section\n      titles\
    \ should be capitalized (this is sometimes called \"title\n      case\").  Typically,\
    \ all words in a title will be capitalized,\n      except for internal articles,\
    \ prepositions, and conjunctions.\n   *  Section titles that are in sentence form\
    \ will follow typical\n      sentence capitalization.\n   *  Titles of figures\
    \ may be in sentence form or use title case.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Citations
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Citations\n   *  References and citations must match.  That is, there must\
    \ be a\n      reference for each citation used, and vice versa.\n   *  Citations\
    \ must be enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[CITE1]\").\n   *  A citation/reference\
    \ tag must not contain spaces.\n         Example: \"[RFC2119]\" rather than \"\
    [RFC 2119]\"\n      However, the proper textual naming of an RFC contains a space.\n\
    \         Example: \"See RFC 2119 [BCP14] for more information.\"\n   *  Cross-references\
    \ within the body of the memo and to other RFCs\n      must use section numbers\
    \ rather than page numbers, as pagination\n      may change per format and device.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Abbreviation Rules
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Abbreviation Rules\n   Abbreviations should be expanded in document titles\
    \ and upon first\n   use in the document.  The full expansion of the text should\
    \ be\n   followed by the abbreviation itself in parentheses.  The exception is\n\
    \   an abbreviation that is so common that the readership of RFCs can be\n   expected\
    \ to recognize it immediately; examples include (but are not\n   limited to) TCP,\
    \ IP, SNMP, and HTTP.  The online list of\n   abbreviations [ABBR] provides guidance.\
    \  Some cases are marginal, and\n   the RFC Editor will make the final judgment,\
    \ weighing obscurity\n   against complexity.\n      Note: The online list of abbreviations\
    \ is not exhaustive or\n      definitive.  It is a list of abbreviations appearing\
    \ in RFCs and\n      sometimes reflects discussions with authors, Working Group\
    \ Chairs,\n      and/or Area Directors (ADs).  Note that some abbreviations have\n\
    \      multiple expansions.  Additionally, this list includes some terms\n   \
    \   that look like abbreviations but that are actually fixed names for\n     \
    \ things and hence cannot and should not be expanded.  These are\n      noted\
    \ as \"No Expansion\".\n"
- title: 4.  Structure of an RFC
  contents:
  - "4.  Structure of an RFC\n   A published RFC will largely contain the elements\
    \ in the following\n   list.  Some of these sections are required, as noted. \
    \ Those sections\n   marked with \"*\" will be supplied by the RFC Editor during\

  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  Author/Editor\n   The determination of who should be listed as an author\
    \ or editor on\n   an RFC is made by the stream.\n   The author's name (initial\
    \ followed by family name) appears on the\n   first line of the heading.  Some\
    \ variation, such as additional\n   initials or capitalization of family name,\

- title: 4.1.2.  Organization
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  Organization\n   The author's organization is indicated on the line following\

    \   \"factored out,\" appearing only once following the corresponding\n   Author\
    \ lines.  However, such factoring is inappropriate when it would\n   force an\
    \ unacceptable reordering of author names.\n   If an author cannot or will not\
    \ provide an affiliation for any\n   reason, \"Independent\", \"Individual Contributor\"\
    , \"Retired\", or some\n   other term that appropriately describes the author's\

  contents:
  - "4.2.  Full Title\n   The title must be centered below the rest of the heading,\
    \ preceded by\n   two blank lines and followed by one blank line.\n   Choosing\
    \ a good title for an RFC can be a challenge.  A good title\n   should fairly\
    \ represent the scope and purpose of the document without\n   being either too\
    \ general or too specific and lengthy.\n   Abbreviations in a title must generally\
    \ be expanded when first\n   encountered (see Section 3.6 for additional guidance\
    \ on\n   abbreviations).\n   It is often helpful to follow the expansion with\
    \ the parenthesized\n   abbreviation, as in the following example:\n         \
    \                 Encoding Rules for the\n          Common Routing Encapsulation\
    \ Extension Protocol (CREEP)\n   The RFC Editor recommends that documents describing\

    \ be\n   constructed in part from material within the Introduction section,\n\

    \ the motivation for the RFC and (if appropriate)\n   describes the applicability\
    \ of the document, e.g., whether it\n   specifies a protocol, provides a discussion\
    \ of some problem, is\n   simply of interest to the Internet community, or provides\
    \ a status\n   report on some activity.  The body of the memo and the Abstract\
    \ must\n   be self-contained and separable.  This may result in some duplication\n\

    \   such as \"Overview\" or \"Background\".  These alternates are acceptable.\n\

    \ for technical features.\n   RFC 2119 [BCP14] defines a default interpretation\
    \ of these\n   capitalized words in IETF documents.  If this interpretation is\
    \ used,\n   RFC 2119 must be cited (as specified in RFC 2119) and included as\
    \ a\n   normative reference.  Otherwise, the correct interpretation must be\n\
    \   specified in the document.\n   This section must appear as part of the body\
    \ of the memo (as defined\n   by this document).  It must appear as part of, or\
    \ subsequent to, the\n   Introduction section.\n   These words are considered\
    \ part of the technical content of the\n   document and are intended to provide\
    \ guidance to implementers about\n   specific technical features, generally governed\
    \ by considerations of\n   interoperability.  RFC 2119 says:\n      Imperatives\
    \ of the type defined in this memo must be used with\n      care and sparingly.\
    \  In particular, they MUST only be used where\n      it is actually required\
    \ for interoperation or to limit behavior\n      which has potential for causing\
    \ harm (e.g., limiting\n      retransmisssions)  For example, they must not be\
    \ used to try to\n      impose a particular method on implementers where the method\
    \ is not\n      required for interoperability.\n"

    \ Editor will update text accordingly after the IANA\n   assignments have been\
    \ made.  It is helpful for authors to clearly\n   identify where text should be\
    \ updated to reflect the newly assigned\n   values.  For example, the use of \"\
    TBD1\", \"TBD2\", etc., is recommended\n   in the IANA Considerations section\

    \ by IANA, the\n   RFC Editor will verify that the values inserted by the authors\
    \ match\n   those that have actually been registered on the IANA site.  When\n\
    \   writing a given value, consistent use of decimal or hexadecimal is\n   recommended.\n\

    \ work with IANA to send queries to the authors to ensure that\n   assignments\
    \ and values are properly inserted.\n   The RFC Editor will remove an IANA Considerations\

  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Related Procedures\n   The following procedures are related to the\
    \ application and updating\n   of the RFC Style Guide.\n"
- title: A.1.  Dispute Resolution
  contents:
  - "A.1.  Dispute Resolution\n   There are competing rationales for some of the rules\
    \ described in\n   this Guide, and the RFC Editor has selected the ones that work\
    \ best\n   for the Series.  However, at times, an author may have a disagreement\n\
    \   with the RFC Production Center (RPC) over the application of Style\n   Guide\
    \ conventions.  In such cases, the authors should discuss their\n   concerns with\
    \ the RPC.  If no agreement can be reached between the\n   RPC and the authors,\
    \ the RFC Series Editor will, with input from the\n   appropriate stream-approving\
    \ body, make a final determination.  If\n   further resolution is required, the\
    \ dispute resolution process as\n   described in the RFC Editor Model [RFC6635]\
    \ will be followed.\n"
- title: A.2.  Returning an I-D to the Document Stream
  contents:
  - "A.2.  Returning an I-D to the Document Stream\n   For a given document, if the\
    \ RFC Editor determines that it cannot be\n   edited without serious risk of altering\
    \ the meaning of the technical\n   content or if the RFC Editor does not have\
    \ the resources to provide\n   the level of editing it needs, it may be sent back\
    \ to the stream-\n   approving body with a request to improve the clarity, consistency,\n\
    \   and/or readability of the document.  This is not to be considered a\n   dispute\
    \ with the author.\n"
- title: A.3.  Revising This Document and Associated Web Pages
  contents:
  - "A.3.  Revising This Document and Associated Web Pages\n   The RFC Series is continually\
    \ evolving as a document series.  This\n   document focuses on the fundamental\
    \ and stable requirements that must\n   be met by an RFC.  From time to time,\
    \ the RFC Editor may offer less\n   formal recommendations that authors may apply\
    \ at their discretion;\n   these recommendations may be found on the RFC Editor\
    \ website\n   \"Guidelines for RFC Style\" [STYLE-WEB].\n   When a new recommendation\
    \ is made regarding the overall structure and\n   formatting of RFCs, it will\
    \ be published on that page and accepted\n   for a period of time before the RFC\
    \ Editor determines whether it\n   should become part of the fundamental requirements\
    \ in the RFC Style\n   Guide or remain as a less formal recommendation.  That\
    \ period of time\n   will vary, in part depending on the frequency with which\
    \ authors\n   encounter and apply the guidance.\n"
