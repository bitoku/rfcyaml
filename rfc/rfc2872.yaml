- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   RSVP [RFC 2205] signaling messages typically include policy data\n\
    \   objects, which in turn contain policy elements. Policy elements may\n   describe\
    \ user and/or application information, which may be used by\n   RSVP aware network\
    \ elements to apply appropriate policy decisions to\n   a traffic flow. This memo\
    \ details the usage of policy elements that\n   provide application information.\n"
- title: 1. Overview
  contents:
  - "1. Overview\n   RSVP aware network elements may act as policy enforcement points\n\
    \   (PEPs). These work together with policy decision points (PDPs) to\n   enforce\
    \ QoS policy. Briefly, PEPs extract policy information from\n   RSVP signaling\
    \ requests and compare the information against\n   information stored by a PDP\
    \ in a (possibly remotely located) policy\n   database or directory. A policy\
    \ decision is made based on the results\n   of the comparison.\n   One type of\
    \ policy information describes the application on behalf of\n   which an RSVP\
    \ signaling request is generated. When application policy\n   information is available,\
    \ network administrators are able to manage\n   QoS based on application type.\
    \ So, for example, a network\n   administrator may establish a policy that prioritizes\
    \ known mission-\n   critical applications over games.\n   This memo describes\
    \ a structure for a policy element that can be used\n   to identify application\
    \ traffic flows. The policy element includes a\n   number of attributes, one of\
    \ which is a policy locator. This policy\n   locator includes the following hierarchically\
    \ ordered sub-elements\n   (in descending levels of hierarchy):\n      1. identifier\
    \ that uniquely identifies the application vendor\n      2. identifier of the\
    \ application\n      3. version number of the application\n      4. sub-application\
    \ identifier\n   An arbitrary number of sub-application identifiers may be included\
    \ in\n   the policy locator. An example of such an identifier is 'print\n   transaction'.\n\
    \   This memo specifies the structure of the application policy element\n   and\
    \ proposes keywords for the sub-elements at each level of the\n   hierarchy. It\
    \ does not enumerate specific values for the sub-\n   elements: such an enumeration\
    \ is beyond the scope of this memo.\n"
- title: 2. Simple Application Identity Policy Element Structure
  contents:
  - "2. Simple Application Identity Policy Element Structure\n   General application\
    \ identity policy elements are defined in\n   [RFC2752]. These are policy elements\
    \ with a P-type of AUTH_APP.\n   Following the policy element header is a list\
    \ of authentication\n   attributes.\n   The first authentication attribute is\
    \ of the A-type POLICY_LOCATOR.\n   The sub-type of the POLICY_LOCATOR attribute\
    \ is of type ASCII_DN\n   [RFC1779] or UNICODE_DN. The actual attribute data is\
    \ formatted as an\n   X.500 distinguished name (DN), representing a globally unique\n\
    \   identifier, the application, version number and sub-application in a\n   hierarchical\
    \ structure. The POLICY_LOCATOR attribute contains\n   keywords as described in\
    \ section 2. For further details on the format\n   of the POLICY_LOCATOR attribute,\
    \ see [RFC2752].\n   The second authentication attribute is of the A-type CREDENTIAL.\
    \ The\n   sub-type of the CREDENTIAL attribute is of type ASCII_ID or\n   UNICODE_ID.\
    \ The actual attribute data is an ASCII or Unicode string\n   representing the\
    \ application name. This structure is illustrated in\n   the following diagram:\n\
    \               0              1               2               3\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\

    \  \"APP=SAP, VER=1.1, SAPP=Print\"\n   \"GUID=http://www.microsoft.com/apps,\
    \ APP=MyApplication, VER=1.2.3\"\n   The APP, VER and SAPP attributes SHOULD describe\
    \ the application to a\n   human reader in as unique and unambiguous a way as\
    \ possible. The GUID\n   attribute MAY be used when absolute uniqueness of application\n\
    \   identification is required and its contents MUST be an identifier\n   from\
    \ a globally-unique source (e.g. domain names as assigned by the\n   corresponding\
    \ registration authorities). Note that publication of the\n   chosen identifiers\
    \ in a suitable format is strongly encouraged.\n"
- title: 3. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3. Security Considerations\n   The proposed simple policy element does not guarantee\
    \ that element is\n   indeed associated with the application it claims to be associated\n\
    \   with. In order to provide such guarantees, it is necessary to sign\n   applications.\
    \ Signed application policy elements may be proposed at a\n   future date. Note\
    \ that, typically, the application policy element\n   will be included in an RSVP\
    \ message with an encrypted and\n   authenticated user policy element. A level\
    \ of security is provided by\n   trusting the application policy element only\
    \ if the user policy\n   element is trusted.\n   All RSVP integrity considerations\
    \ apply to the message containing the\n   application policy element.\n"
