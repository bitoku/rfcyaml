  - "1.  Introduction\n   Localized mobility management has been the topic of much\
    \ work in the\n   IETF.  The experimental protocols developed from previous works,\n\
    \   namely Fast-Handovers for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) [13] and Hierarchical\n   Mobile\
    \ IPv6 (HMIPv6) [18], involve host-based solutions that require\n   host involvement\
    \ at the IP layer similar to, or in addition to, that\n   required by Mobile IPv6\
    \ [10] for global mobility management.\n   However, recent developments in the\
    \ IETF and the Wireless LAN (WLAN)\n   infrastructure market suggest that it may\
    \ be time to take a fresh\n   look at localized mobility management.\n   First,\
    \ new IETF work on global mobility management protocols that are\n   not Mobile\
    \ IPv6, such as Host Identity Protocol (HIP) [16] and IKEv2\n   Mobility and Multihoming\
    \ (MOBIKE) [4], suggests that future wireless\n   IP nodes may support a more\
    \ diverse set of global mobility protocols.\n   While it is possible that existing\
    \ localized mobility management\n   protocols could be used with HIP and MOBIKE,\
    \ some would require\n   additional effort to implement, deploy, or in some cases,\
    \ even\n   specify in a non-Mobile IPv6 mobile environment.\n   Second, the success\
    \ in the WLAN infrastructure market of WLAN\n   switches, which perform localized\
    \ management without any host stack\n   involvement, suggests a possible paradigm\
    \ that could be used to\n   accommodate other global mobility options on the mobile\
    \ node while\n   reducing host stack software complexity, expanding the range\
    \ of\n   mobile nodes that could be accommodated.\n   This document briefly describes\
    \ the general local mobility problem\n   and scenarios where localized mobility\
    \ management would be desirable.\n   Then problems with existing or proposed IETF\
    \ localized mobility\n   management protocols are briefly discussed.  The network-based\n\
    \   mobility management architecture and a short description of how it\n   solves\
    \ these problems are presented.  A more detailed discussion of\n   goals for a\
    \ network-based, localized mobility management protocol and\n   gap analysis for\
    \ existing protocols can be found in [11].  Note that\n   IPv6 and wireless links\
    \ are considered to be the initial scope for a\n   network-based localized mobility\
    \ management, so the language in this\n   document reflects that scope.  However,\
    \ the conclusions of this\n   document apply equally to IPv4 and wired links,\
    \ where nodes are\n   disconnecting and reconnecting.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   Mobility terminology in this document follows that in RFC\
    \ 3753 [14],\n   with the addition of some new and revised terminology given here:\n\
    \   WLAN Switch\n      A WLAN switch is a multiport bridge Ethernet [8] switch\
    \ that\n      connects network segments but also allows a physical and logical\n\
    \      star topology, which runs a protocol to control a collection of\n     \
    \ 802.11 [6] access points.  The access point control protocol\n      allows the\
    \ switch to perform radio resource management functions\n      such as power control\
    \ and terminal load balancing between the\n      access points.  Most WLAN switches\
    \ also support a proprietary\n      protocol for inter-subnet IP mobility, usually\
    \ involving some kind\n      of inter-switch IP tunnel, which provides session\
    \ continuity when\n      a terminal moves between subnets.\n   Access Network\n\
    \      An access network is a collection of fixed and mobile network\n      components\
    \ allowing access to the Internet all belonging to a\n      single operational\
    \ domain.  It may consist of multiple air\n      interface technologies (for example,\
    \ 802.16e [7], Universal Mobile\n      Telecommunications System (UMTS) [1], etc.)\
    \  interconnected with\n      multiple types of backhaul interconnections (such\
    \ as Synchronous\n      Optical Network (SONET) [9], metro Ethernet [15] [8],\
    \ etc.).\n   Local Mobility (revised)\n      Local Mobility is mobility over an\
    \ access network.  Note that\n      although the area of network topology over\
    \ which the mobile node\n      moves may be restricted, the actual geographic\
    \ area could be quite\n      large, depending on the mapping between the network\
    \ topology and\n      the wireless coverage area.\n   Localized Mobility Management\n\
    \      Localized Mobility Management is a generic term for any protocol\n    \
    \  that maintains the IP connectivity and reachability of a mobile\n      node\
    \ for purposes of maintaining session continuity when the\n      mobile node moves,\
    \ and whose signaling is confined to an access\n      network.\n   Localized Mobility\
    \ Management Protocol\n      A protocol that supports localized mobility management.\n\
    \   Global Mobility Management Protocol\n      A Global Mobility Management Protocol\
    \ is a mobility protocol used\n      by the mobile node to change the global,\
    \ end-to-end routing of\n      packets for purposes of maintaining session continuity\
    \ when\n      movement causes a topology change, thus invalidating a global\n\
    \      unicast address of the mobile node.  This protocol could be Mobile\n  \
    \    IP [10] [17], but it could also be HIP [16] or MOBIKE [4].\n   Global Mobility\
    \ Anchor Point\n      A node in the network where the mobile node maintains a\
    \ permanent\n      address and a mapping between the permanent address and the\
    \ local\n      temporary address where the mobile node happens to be currently\n\
    \      located.  The Global Mobility Anchor Point may be used for\n      purposes\
    \ of rendezvous and possibly traffic forwarding.\n   Intra-Link Mobility\n   \
    \   Intra-Link Mobility is mobility between wireless access points\n      within\
    \ a link.  Typically, this kind of mobility only involves\n      Layer 2 mechanisms,\
    \ so Intra-Link Mobility is often called Layer 2\n      mobility.  No IP subnet\
    \ configuration is required upon movement\n      since the link does not change,\
    \ but some IP signaling may be\n      required for the mobile node to confirm\
    \ whether or not the change\n      of wireless access point also resulted in the\
    \ previous access\n      routers becoming unreachable.  If the link is served\
    \ by a single\n      access point/router combination, then this type of mobility\
    \ is\n      typically absent.  See Figure 1.\n"
- title: 2.  The Local Mobility Problem
  contents:
  - "2.  The Local Mobility Problem\n   The local mobility problem is restricted to\
    \ providing IP mobility\n   management for mobile nodes within an access network.\
    \  The access\n   network gateways function as aggregation routers.  In this case,\n\
    \   there is no specialized routing protocol (e.g., Generic Tunneling\n   Protocol\
    \ (GTP), Cellular IP, Hawaii, etc.) and the routers form a\n   standard IP routed\
    \ network (e.g., OSPF, Intermediate System to\n   Intermediate System (IS-IS),\
    \ RIP, etc.).  This is illustrated in\n   Figure 1, where the access network gateway\
    \ routers are designated as\n   \"ANG\".  Transitions between service providers\
    \ in separate autonomous\n   systems, or across broader, topological \"boundaries\"\
    \ within the same\n   service provider, are excluded.\n   Figure 1 depicts the\
    \ scope of local mobility in comparison to global\n   mobility.  The Access Network\
    \ Gateways (ANGs), GA1 and GB1, are\n   gateways to their access networks.  The\
    \ Access Routers (ARs), RA1 and\n   RA2, are in access network A; RB1 is in access\
    \ network B.  Note that\n   it is possible to have additional aggregation routers\
    \ between ANG GA1\n   and ANG GB1, and the access routers if the access network\
    \ is large.\n   Access Points (APs) PA1 through PA3 are in access network A; PB1\
    \ and\n   PB2 are in access network B.  Other ANGs, ARs, and APs are also\n  \
    \ possible, and other routers can separate the ARs from the ANGs.  The\n   figure\
    \ implies a star topology for the access network deployment, and\n   the star\
    \ topology is the primary interest since it is quite common,\n   but the problems\
    \ discussed here are equally relevant to ring or mesh\n   topologies in which\
    \ ARs are directly connected through some part of\n   the network.\n         \

    \     Mobility     Mobility\n        Mobility\n         Figure 1.  Scope of Local\
    \ and Global Mobility Management\n   As shown in the figure, a global mobility\
    \ protocol may be necessary\n   when a mobile node (MN) moves between two access\
    \ networks.  Exactly\n   what the scope of the access networks is depends on deployment\n\
    \   considerations.  Mobility between two APs under the same AR\n   constitutes\
    \ intra-link (or Layer 2) mobility, and is typically\n   handled by Layer 2 mobility\
    \ protocols (if there is only one AP/cell\n   per AR, then intra-link mobility\
    \ may be lacking).  Between these two\n   lies local mobility.  Local mobility\
    \ occurs when a mobile node moves\n   between two APs connected to two different\
    \ ARs.\n   Global mobility protocols allow a mobile node to maintain\n   reachability\
    \ when the MN's globally routable IP address changes.  It\n   does this by updating\
    \ the address mapping between the permanent\n   address and temporary local address\
    \ at the global mobility anchor\n   point, or even end to end by changing the\
    \ temporary local address\n   directly at the node with which the mobile node\
    \ is corresponding.  A\n   global mobility management protocol can therefore be\
    \ used between ARs\n   for handling local mobility.  However, there are three\
    \ well-known\n   problems involved in using a global mobility protocol for every\n\
    \   movement between ARs.  Briefly, they are:\n   1) Update latency.  If the global\
    \ mobility anchor point and/or\n      correspondent node (for route-optimized\
    \ traffic) is at some\n      distance from the mobile node's access network, the\
    \ global\n      mobility update may require a considerable amount of time.  During\n\
    \      this time, packets continue to be routed to the old temporary\n      local\
    \ address and are essentially dropped.\n   2) Signaling overhead.  The amount\
    \ of signaling required when a\n      mobile node moves from one last-hop link\
    \ to another can be quite\n      extensive, including all the signaling required\
    \ to configure an IP\n      address on the new link and global mobility protocol\
    \ signaling\n      back into the network for changing the permanent to temporary\n\
    \      local address mapping.  The signaling volume may negatively impact\n  \
    \    wireless bandwidth usage and real-time service performance.\n   3) Location\
    \ privacy.  The change in temporary local address as the\n      mobile node moves\
    \ exposes the mobile node's topological location\n      to correspondents and\
    \ potentially to eavesdroppers.  An attacker\n      that can assemble a mapping\
    \ between subnet prefixes in the mobile\n      node's access network and geographical\
    \ locations can determine\n      exactly where the mobile node is located.  This\
    \ can expose the\n      mobile node's user to threats on their location privacy.\
    \  A more\n      detailed discussion of location privacy for Mobile IPv6 can be\n\
    \      found in [12].\n   These problems suggest that a protocol to localize the\
    \ management of\n   topologically small movements is preferable to using a global\n\
    \   mobility management protocol on each movement to a new link.  In\n   addition\
    \ to these problems, localized mobility management can provide\n   a measure of\
    \ local control, so mobility management can be tuned for\n   specialized local\
    \ conditions.  Note also that if localized mobility\n   management is provided,\
    \ it is not strictly required for a mobile node\n   to support a global mobility\
    \ management protocol since movement\n   within a restricted IP access network\
    \ can still be accommodated.\n   Without such support, however, a mobile node\
    \ experiences a disruption\n   in its traffic when it moves beyond the border\
    \ of the localized\n   mobility management domain.\n"

    \ in which localized mobility\n   management is useful.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Large Campus
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Large Campus\n   One scenario where localized mobility management would\
    \ be attractive\n   is a campus WLAN deployment, in which the geographical span\
    \ of the\n   campus, distribution of buildings, availability of wiring in\n  \
    \ buildings, etc. preclude deploying all WLAN access points as part of\n   the\
    \ same IP subnet.  WLAN Layer 2 mobility could not be used across\n   the entire\
    \ campus.\n   In this case, the campus is divided into separate last-hop links,\n\
    \   each served by one or more access routers.  This kind of deployment\n   is\
    \ served today by WLAN switches that coordinate IP mobility between\n   them,\
    \ effectively providing localized mobility management at the link\n   layer. \
    \ Since the protocols are proprietary and not interoperable,\n   any deployments\
    \ that require IP mobility necessarily require switches\n   from the same vendor.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Advanced Cellular Network
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Advanced Cellular Network\n   Next-generation cellular protocols, such\
    \ as 802.16e [7] and Super\n   3G/3.9G [2], have the potential to run IP deeper\
    \ into the access\n   network than the current 3G cellular protocols, similar\
    \ to today's\n   WLAN networks.  This means that the access network can become\
    \ a\n   routed IP network.  Interoperable localized mobility management can\n\
    \   unify local mobility across a diverse set of wireless protocols all\n   served\
    \ by IP, including advanced cellular, WLAN, and personal area\n   wireless technologies\
    \ such as UltraWide Band (UWB) [5] and Bluetooth\n   [3].  Localized mobility\
    \ management at the IP layer does not replace\n   Layer 2 mobility (where available)\
    \ but rather complements it.  A\n   standardized, interoperable localized mobility\
    \ management protocol\n   for IP can remove the dependence on IP-layer localized\
    \ mobility\n   protocols that are specialized to specific link technologies or\n\
    \   proprietary, which is the situation with today's 3G protocols.  The\n   expected\
    \ benefit is a reduction in maintenance cost and deployment\n   complexity.  See\
    \ [11] for a more detailed discussion of the goals for\n   a network-based localized\

    \ [5] and Bluetooth [3], are designed\n   for low transmit power, short-range\

- title: 4.  Problems with Existing Solutions
  contents:
  - "4.  Problems with Existing Solutions\n   Existing solutions for localized mobility\
    \ management fall into two\n   classes:\n   1) Interoperable IP-level protocols\
    \ that require changes to the\n      mobile node's IP stack and handle localized\
    \ mobility management as\n      a service provided to the mobile node by the access\
    \ network.\n   2) Link specific or proprietary protocols that handle localized\n\
    \      mobility for any mobile node but only for a specific type of link\n   \
    \   layer, for example, 802.11 [6].\n   The dedicated localized mobility management\
    \ IETF protocols for\n   Solution 1 are not yet widely deployed, but work continues\
    \ on\n   standardization.  Some Mobile IPv4 deployments use localized mobility\n\
    \   management.  For Solution 1, the following are specific problems:\n   1) The\
    \ host stack software requirement limits broad usage even if the\n      modifications\
    \ are small.  The success of WLAN switches indicates\n      that network operators\
    \ and users prefer no host stack software\n      modifications.  This preference\
    \ is independent of the lack of\n      widespread Mobile IPv4 deployment, since\
    \ it is much easier to\n      deploy and use the network.\n   2) Future mobile\
    \ nodes may choose other global mobility management\n      protocols, such as\
    \ HIP or MOBIKE.  The existing localized mobility\n      management solutions\
    \ all depend on Mobile IP or derivatives.\n   3) Existing localized mobility management\
    \ solutions do not support\n      both IPv4 and IPv6.\n   4) Existing host-based\
    \ localized mobility management solutions\n      require setting up additional\
    \ security associations with network\n      elements in the access domain.\n \
    \  Market acceptance of WLAN switches has been very large, so Solution 2\n   is\
    \ widely deployed and continuing to grow.  Solution 2 has the\n   following problems:\n\
    \   1) Existing solutions only support WLAN networks with Ethernet\n      backhaul\
    \ and therefore are not available for advanced cellular\n      networks or picocellular\
    \ protocols, or other types of wired\n      backhaul.\n   2) Each WLAN switch\
    \ vendor has its own proprietary protocol that does\n      not interoperate with\
    \ other vendors' equipment.\n   3) Because the solutions are based on Layer 2\
    \ routing, they may not\n      scale up to a metropolitan area or local province,\
    \ particularly\n      when multiple kinds of link technologies are used in the\
    \ backbone.\n"

    \ standardized localized mobility management\n   protocol that is scalable to\
    \ topologically large networks, but\n   requires no host stack involvement for\
    \ localized mobility management\n   is a highly desirable solution.  The advantages\
    \ that this solution\n   has over Solutions 1 and 2 above are as follows:\n  \
    \ 1) Compared with Solution 1, a network-based solution requires no\n      localized\
    \ mobility management support on the mobile node and is\n      independent of\
    \ global mobility management protocol, so it can be\n      used with any or none\

    \ a more modular mobility management\n      architecture that better accommodates\
    \ changing technology and\n      market requirements.\n   2) Compared with Solution\
    \ 2, an IP-level network-based localized\n      mobility management solution works\
    \ for link protocols other than\n      Ethernet, and for wide area networks.\n\

    \ with providing a service to a host.  Network-based localized mobility\n   management\
    \ requires security among network elements that is\n   equivalent to what is needed\
    \ for routing information security, and\n   security between the host and network\
    \ that is equivalent to what is\n   needed for network access, but no more.  A\
    \ more complete discussion\n   of the security goals for network-based localized\
    \ mobility management\n   can be found in [11].\n"
