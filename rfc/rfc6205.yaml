  - "Abstract\n   Technology in the optical domain is constantly evolving, and, as\
    \ a\n   consequence, new equipment providing lambda switching capability has\n\
    \   been developed and is currently being deployed.\n   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)\
    \ is a family of protocols that can be used to\n   operate networks built from\
    \ a range of technologies including\n   wavelength (or lambda) switching.  For\
    \ this purpose, GMPLS defined a\n   wavelength label as only having significance\
    \ between two neighbors.\n   Global wavelength semantics are not considered.\n\
    \   In order to facilitate interoperability in a network composed of next\n  \
    \ generation lambda-switch-capable equipment, this document defines a\n   standard\
    \ lambda label format that is compliant with the Dense\n   Wavelength Division\
    \ Multiplexing (DWDM) and Coarse Wavelength\n   Division Multiplexing (CWDM) grids\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   As described in [RFC3945], GMPLS extends MPLS from supporting\
    \ only\n   Packet Switching Capable (PSC) interfaces and switching to also\n \
    \  supporting four new classes of interfaces and switching:\n   o Layer-2 Switch\
    \ Capable (L2SC)\n   o Time-Division Multiplex (TDM) Capable\n   o Lambda Switch\
    \ Capable (LSC)\n   o Fiber Switch Capable (FSC)\n   A functional description\
    \ of the extensions to MPLS signaling needed\n   to support new classes of interfaces\
    \ and switching is provided in\n   [RFC3471].\n   This document presents details\
    \ that are specific to the use of GMPLS\n   with LSC equipment.  Technologies\
    \ such as Reconfigurable Optical\n   Add/Drop Multiplex (ROADM) and Wavelength\
    \ Cross-Connect (WXC) operate\n   at the wavelength switching level.  [RFC3471]\
    \ states that wavelength\n   labels \"only have significance between two neighbors\"\
    \ (Section\n   3.2.1.1); global wavelength semantics are not considered.  In order\n\
    \   to facilitate interoperability in a network composed of LSC\n   equipment,\
    \ this document defines a standard lambda label format,\n   which is compliant\
    \ with both the Dense Wavelength Division\n   Multiplexing (DWDM) grid [G.694.1]\
    \ and the Coarse Wavelength Division\n   Multiplexing (CWDM) grid [G.694.2].\n"

  - "2.  Assumed Network Model and Related Problem Statement\n   Figure 1 depicts\
    \ an all-optical switched network consisting of\n   different vendors' optical\
    \ network domains.  Vendor A's network\n   consists of ROADM or WXC, and Vendor\
    \ B's network consists of a number\n   of Photonic Cross-Connects (PXCs) and DWDM\
    \ multiplexers and\n   demultiplexers.  Otherwise, both vendors' networks might\
    \ be based on\n   the same technology.\n   In this case, the use of standardized\
    \ wavelength label information is\n   quite significant to establish a wavelength-based\
    \ Label Switched Path\n   (LSP).  It is also an important constraint when calculating\
    \ the\n   Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) for use by Generalized Multi-\n\

    \ Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling [RFC3473].  The way the CSPF\n   is performed\
    \ is outside the scope of this document.\n   Needless to say, an LSP must be appropriately\

    \      Figure 2.  Interconnecting Details between Two Domains\n   In the scenario\
    \ of Figure 1, consider the setting up of a\n   bidirectional LSP from ingress\
    \ switch (Node-1) to egress switch\n   (Node-9) using GMPLS RSVP-TE.  In order\
    \ to satisfy wavelength\n   continuity constraints, a fixed wavelength (lambda\
    \ 1) needs to be\n   used in Domain A and Domain B.  A Path message will be used\
    \ for\n   signaling.  The Path message will contain an Upstream_Label object\n\
    \   and a Label_Set object, both containing the same value.  The\n   Label_Set\
    \ object shall contain a single sub-channel that must be the\n   same as the Upstream_Label\
    \ object.  The Path setup will continue\n   downstream to egress switch (Node-9)\
    \ by configuring each lambda\n   switch based on the wavelength label.  If a node\
    \ has a tunable\n   wavelength transponder, the tuning wavelength is considered\
    \ a part of\n   the wavelength switching operation.\n   Not using a standardized\
    \ label would add undue burden on the operator\n   to enforce policy as each manufacturer\
    \ may decide on a different\n   representation; therefore, each domain may have\
    \ its own label\n   formats.  Moreover, manual provisioning may lead to misconfiguration\n\
    \   if domain-specific labels are used.\n   Therefore, a wavelength label should\
    \ be standardized in order to\n   allow interoperability between multiple domains;\
    \ otherwise,\n   appropriate existing labels are identified in support of wavelength\n\
    \   availability.  Containing identical wavelength information, the ITU-T\n  \
    \ DWDM frequency grid specified in [G.694.1] and the CWDM wavelength\n   information\
    \ in [G.694.2] are used by Label Switching Routers (LSRs)\n   and should be followed\
    \ for wavelength labels.\n"
- title: 3.  Label-Related Formats
  contents:
  - "3.  Label-Related Formats\n   To deal with the widening scope of MPLS into the\
    \ optical switching\n   and time division multiplexing domains, several new forms\
    \ of \"label\"\n   have been defined in [RFC3471].  This section contains a definition\n\
    \   of a wavelength label based on [G.694.1] or [G.694.2] for use by LSC\n   LSRs.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Wavelength Labels
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Wavelength Labels\n   Section 3.2.1.1 of [RFC3471] defines wavelength labels:\
    \ \"values used\n   in this field only have significance between two neighbors,\
    \ and the\n   receiver may need to convert the received value into a value that\
    \ has\n   local significance\".\n   We do not need to define a new type as the\
    \ information stored is\n   either a port label or a wavelength label.  Only the\
    \ wavelength label\n   needs to be defined.\n   LSC equipment uses multiple wavelengths\
    \ controlled by a single\n   control channel.  In such a case, the label indicates\
    \ the wavelength\n   to be used for the LSP.  This document defines a standardized\n\
    \   wavelength label format.  For examples of wavelength values, refer to\n  \
    \ [G.694.1], which lists the frequencies from the ITU-T DWDM frequency\n   grid.\
    \  For CWDM technology, refer to the wavelength values defined in\n   [G.694.2].\n\
    \   Since the ITU-T DWDM grid is based on nominal central frequencies, we\n  \
    \ need to indicate the appropriate table, the channel spacing in the\n   grid,\
    \ and a value n that allows the calculation of the frequency.\n   That value can\
    \ be positive or negative.\n   The frequency is calculated as such in [G.694.1]:\n\
    \        Frequency (THz) = 193.1 THz + n * channel spacing (THz)\n   Where \"\
    n\" is a two's-complement integer (positive, negative, or 0)\n   and \"channel\
    \ spacing\" is defined to be 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, or 0.1\n   THz.  When wider\
    \ channel spacing such as 0.2 THz is utilized, the\n   combination of narrower\
    \ channel spacing and the value \"n\" can provide\n   proper frequency with that\
    \ channel spacing.  Channel spacing is not\n   utilized to indicate the LSR capability\
    \ but only to specify a\n   frequency in signaling.\n   For other cases that use\
    \ the ITU-T CWDM grid, the spacing between\n   different channels is defined as\
    \ 20 nm, so we need to express the\n   wavelength value in nanometers (nm).  Examples\
    \ of CWDM wavelengths in\n   nm are 1471, 1491, etc.\n   The wavelength is calculated\
    \ as follows:\n        Wavelength (nm) = 1471 nm + n * 20 nm\n   Where \"n\" is\
    \ a two's-complement integer (positive, negative, or 0).\n   The grids listed\
    \ in [G.694.1] and [G.694.2] are not numbered and\n   change with the changing\
    \ frequency spacing as technology advances, so\n   an index is not appropriate\
    \ in this case.\n"

    \ |\n   +----------+---------+\n   (3) Identifier: 9 bits\n   The Identifier field\
    \ in lambda label format is used to distinguish\n   different lasers (in one node)\
    \ when they can transmit the same\n   frequency lambda.  The Identifier field\
    \ is a per-node assigned and\n   scoped value.  This field MAY change on a per-hop\
    \ basis.  In all\n   cases but one, a node MAY select any value, including zero\
    \ (0), for\n   this field.  Once selected, the value MUST NOT change until the\
    \ LSP\n   is torn down, and the value MUST be used in all LSP-related messages,\n\
    \   e.g., in Resv messages and label RRO subobjects.  The sole special\n   case\
    \ occurs when this label format is used in a label ERO subobject.\n   In this\
    \ case, the special value of zero (0) means that the referenced\n   node MAY assign\
    \ any Identifier field value, including zero (0), when\n   establishing the corresponding\
    \ LSP.  When a non-zero value is\n   assigned to the Identifier field in a label\
    \ ERO subobject, the\n   referenced node MUST use the assigned value for the Identifier\
    \ field\n   in the corresponding LSP-related messages.\n   (4) n: 16 bits\n  \
    \ n is a two's-complement integer.  This value is used to compute the\n   wavelength\
    \ as shown above.\n"
