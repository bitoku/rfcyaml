  - "1.  Introduction\n   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] enables network-based\
    \ mobility\n   for IPv6 hosts that do not implement any mobility protocols.  The\n\
    \   protocol is described in detail in [RFC5213].  In order to facilitate\n  \
    \ the network-based mobility, the PMIPv6 protocol defines a mobile\n   access\
    \ gateway (MAG), which acts as a proxy for the Mobile IPv6\n   [RFC3775] signaling,\
    \ and the local mobility anchor (LMA), which acts\n   similar to a home agent,\
    \ anchoring a mobile node's sessions within a\n   PMIPv6 domain.  The LMA and\
    \ the MAG establish a bidirectional tunnel\n   for forwarding all data traffic\
    \ belonging to the mobile nodes.\n   In a distributed environment such as a PMIPv6\
    \ domain consisting of\n   LMAs and MAGs, it is necessary for the nodes to 1)\
    \ have a consistent\n   state about each other's reachability, and 2) quickly\
    \ inform peers in\n   the event of recovery from node failures.  So, when the\
    \ LMA restarts\n   after a failure, the MAG should (quickly) learn about the restart\
    \ so\n   that it can take appropriate actions (such as releasing any\n   resources).\
    \  When there are no failures, a MAG should know about the\n   LMA's reachability\
    \ (and vice versa) so that the path can be assumed\n   to be functioning.\n  \
    \ This document specifies a heartbeat mechanism between the MAG and the\n   LMA\
    \ to detect the status of reachability between them.  This document\n   also specifies\
    \ a mechanism to indicate node restarts; the mechanism\n   could be used to quickly\
    \ inform peers of such restarts.  The\n   Heartbeat message is a Mobility Header\
    \ message (protocol type 135)\n   that is periodically exchanged at a configurable\
    \ threshold of time or\n   sent unsolicited soon after a node restart.  This document\
    \ does not\n   specify the specific actions (such as releasing resources) that\
    \ a\n   node takes as a response to processing the Heartbeat messages.\n"

- title: 3.  Heartbeat Mechanism
  contents:
  - "3.  Heartbeat Mechanism\n   The MAG and the LMA exchange Heartbeat messages every\n\
    \   HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL seconds to detect the current status of\n   reachability\
    \ between them.  The MAG initiates the heartbeat exchange\n   to test if the LMA\
    \ is reachable by sending a Heartbeat Request\n   message to the LMA.  Each Heartbeat\
    \ Request contains a sequence\n   number that is incremented monotonically.  The\
    \ sequence number on the\n   last Heartbeat Request message is always recorded\
    \ by the MAG, and is\n   used to match the corresponding Heartbeat Response. \
    \ Similarly, the\n   LMA also initiates a heartbeat exchange with the MAG, by\
    \ sending a\n   Heartbeat Request message, to check if the MAG is reachable. \
    \ The\n   format of the Heartbeat message is described in Section 3.3.\n   A Heartbeat\
    \ Request message can be sent only if the MAG has at least\n   one proxy Binding\
    \ Cache entry at the LMA for a mobile node attached\n   to the MAG.  If there\
    \ are no proxy Binding Cache entries at the LMA\n   for any of the mobile nodes\
    \ attached to the MAG, then the Heartbeat\n   message SHOULD NOT be sent.  Similarly,\
    \ the LMA SHOULD NOT send a\n   Heartbeat Request message to a MAG if there is\
    \ no active Binding\n   Cache entry created by the MAG.  A PMIPv6 node MUST respond\
    \ to a\n   Heartbeat Request message with a Heartbeat Response message,\n   irrespective\
    \ of whether there is an active Binding Cache entry.\n   The HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL\
    \ SHOULD NOT be configured to a value less than\n   30 seconds.  Deployments should\
    \ be careful in setting the value for\n   the HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL.  Sending Heartbeat\
    \ messages too often may\n   become an overhead on the path between the MAG and\
    \ the LMA.  It could\n   also create congestion in the network and negatively\
    \ affect network\n   performance.  The HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL can be set to a much\
    \ larger\n   value on the MAG and the LMA, if required, to reduce the burden of\n\
    \   sending periodic Heartbeat messages.\n   If the LMA or the MAG do not support\
    \ the Heartbeat messages, they\n   respond with a Binding Error message with status\
    \ set to 2\n   (unrecognized mobility header (MH) type value) as described in\n\
    \   [RFC3775].  When the Binding Error message with status set to 2 is\n   received\
    \ in response to a Heartbeat Request message, the initiating\n   MAG or the LMA\
    \ MUST NOT use Heartbeat messages with the other end\n   again.\n   If a PMIPv6\
    \ node has detected that a peer PMIPv6 node has failed or\n   restarted without\
    \ retaining the PMIPv6 session state, it should mark\n   the corresponding binding\
    \ update list or binding cache entries as\n   invalid.  The PMIPv6 node may also\
    \ take other actions, which are\n   outside the scope of this document.\n   The\
    \ detection of failure and restart events may be signaled to\n   network operators\
    \ by using asynchronous notifications.  Future work\n   may define such notifications\
    \ in a Structure of Management\n   Information Version 2 (SMIv2) Management Information\
    \ Base (MIB)\n   module.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Failure Detection
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Failure Detection\n   A PMIPv6 node (MAG or LMA) matches every received\
    \ Heartbeat Response\n   to the Heartbeat Request sent using the sequence number.\
    \  Before\n   sending the next Heartbeat Request, it increments a local variable\n\
    \   MISSING_HEARTBEAT if it has not received a Heartbeat Response for the\n  \
    \ previous request.  When this local variable MISSING_HEARTBEAT exceeds\n   a\
    \ configurable parameter MISSING_HEARTBEATS_ALLOWED, the PMIPv6 node\n   concludes\
    \ that the peer PMIPv6 node is not reachable.  If a Heartbeat\n   Response message\
    \ is received, the MISSING_HEARTBEATS counter is\n   reset.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Restart Detection
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Restart Detection\n   The section describes a mechanism for detecting failure\
    \ recovery\n   without session persistence.  In the case that the LMA or the MAG\n\
    \   crashes and reboots and loses all state with respect to the PMIPv6\n   sessions,\
    \ it would be beneficial for the peer PMIPv6 node to discover\n   the failure\
    \ and the loss of session state and establish the sessions\n   again.\n   Each\
    \ PMIPv6 node (both the MAG and LMA) MUST maintain a monotonically\n   increasing\
    \ Restart Counter that is incremented every time the node\n   reboots and loses\
    \ PMIPv6 session state.  The counter MUST NOT be\n   incremented if the recovery\
    \ happens without losing state for the\n   PMIPv6 sessions active at the time\
    \ of failure.  This counter MUST be\n   treated as state that is preserved across\
    \ reboots.  A PMIPv6 node\n   includes a Restart Counter mobility option, described\
    \ in Section 3.4,\n   in a Heartbeat Response message to indicate the current\
    \ value of the\n   Restart Counter.  Each PMIPv6 node MUST also store the Restart\n\
    \   Counter for all the peer PMIPv6 nodes with which it currently has\n   sessions.\
    \  Stored Restart Counter values for peer PMIPv6 nodes do not\n   need to be preserved\
    \ across reboots.\n   The PMIPv6 node that receives the Heartbeat Response message\
    \ compares\n   the Restart Counter value with the previously received value. \
    \ If the\n   value is different, the receiving node assumes that the peer PMIPv6\n\
    \   node had crashed and recovered.  If the Restart Counter value changes\n  \
    \ or if there was no previously stored value, the new value is stored\n   by the\
    \ receiving PMIPv6 node.\n   If a PMIPv6 node restarts and loses PMIPv6 session\
    \ state, it SHOULD\n   send an unsolicited Heartbeat Response message with an\
    \ incremented\n   Restart Counter to all the PMIPv6 nodes that had previously\n\
    \   established PMIPv6 sessions.  Note that this is possible only when\n   the\
    \ PMIPv6 node is capable of storing information about the peers\n   across reboots.\
    \  The unsolicited Heartbeat Response message allows\n   the peer PMIPv6 nodes\
    \ to quickly discover the restart.  The sequence\n   number field in the unsolicited\
    \ Heartbeat Response is ignored and no\n   response is necessary; the nodes will\
    \ synchronize during the next\n   request and response exchange.\n"
