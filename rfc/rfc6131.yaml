  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Sieve [RFC5228] Vacation extension [RFC5230] defines\
    \ a mechanism\n   to generate automatic replies to incoming email messages.  Through\n\
    \   the \":days\" parameter, it limits the number of auto-replies to the\n   same\
    \ sender to one per [n] days, for a specified number of days.  But\n   there are\
    \ cases when one needs more granularity, if one would like to\n   generate \"\
    vacation\" replies more frequently.\n   This extension defines a \":seconds\"\
    \ parameter to provide more\n   granularity for such situations.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology Used in This Document
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology Used in This Document\n   The upper-case key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",\n   \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to\
    \ be interpreted as described in RFC\n   2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  The ':seconds' Parameter
  contents:
  - "2.  The ':seconds' Parameter\n   The purpose of the \":seconds\" parameter is\
    \ to specify the minimum\n   time interval (in seconds) between consecutive auto-replies\
    \ to a\n   given sender.  The \":seconds\" value, if specified, is used instead\
    \ of\n   the \":days\" value, and works in a similar way (see the Vacation\n \
    \  extension [RFC5230] for details).  Only one of \":days\" or \":seconds\"\n\
    \   is allowed -- use of both parameters in the same vacation action MUST\n  \
    \ result in a Sieve processing error.\n   The capability string associated with\
    \ this extension is \"vacation-\n   seconds\".  Note that \"vacation-seconds\"\
    \ implies \"vacation\", and a\n   script with \"vacation-seconds\" in a \"require\"\
    \ list can omit\n   \"vacation\" from that list.\n   The time value is specified\
    \ in seconds, and MUST be greater than or\n   equal to 0 and less than 2**31.\
    \  All valid values, from 0 to 2**31,\n   MUST be accepted without error.  Sites\
    \ MAY define a minimum effective\n   value and/or a maximum effective value. \
    \ If a site chooses to do\n   that:\n   1.  Call the value specified \"v(spec)\"\
    .\n   2.  Call the minimum effective value \"v(min)\".\n   3.  Call the maximum\
    \ effective value \"v(max)\".\n   4.  Call the actual effective value used by\
    \ the processor \"v(eff)\".\n   5.  The following apply for determining v(eff):\n\
    \       *  If 0 <= v(spec) < v(min), then v(eff) = v(min).\n       *  If v(min)\
    \ <= v(spec) <= v(max), then v(eff) = v(spec).\n       *  If v(max) < v(spec)\
    \ <= 2**31, then v(eff) = v(max).\n   If a site imposes a maximum effective value,\
    \ that value MUST be at\n   least 86400 (one day).\n   If \":seconds 0\" is specified\
    \ and used, it means that all auto-replies\n   are sent, and no attempt is made\
    \ to suppress consecutive replies.\n   This differs from the base vacation specification,\
    \ which does not\n   allow a time period of zero (\":days 0\" is forbidden); the\
    \ change is\n   necessary to allow operation of an auto-responder (see [RFC6133],\
    \ and\n   note especially example 4 in section 3 of that document).\n   If \"\
    :seconds\" and \":days\" are both omitted, a site-defined interval\n   is used\
    \ (see [RFC5230]).\n   Usage: vacation [\":days\" number | \":seconds\" number]\n\
    \                   [\":subject\" string]\n                   [\":from\" string]\n\
    \                   [\":addresses\" string-list]\n                   [\":mime\"\
    ]\n                   [\":handle\" string]\n                   <reason: string>\n"
- title: 3.  Examples
  contents:
  - "3.  Examples\n   The following example will automatically reply to senders with\
    \ a\n   message that the recipient is in a meeting.  Multiple replies to the\n\
    \   same sender will only be sent every half hour (1800 seconds).\n   require\
    \ [\"vacation-seconds\"];\n   vacation :addresses [\"tjs@example.edu\", \"ts4z@landru.example.edu\"\
    ]\n            :seconds 1800\n            \"I am in a meeting, and do not have\
    \ access to email.\";\n   The following example is used to send an acknowledgment\
    \ to every\n   message received.  A :seconds value of zero is used to reply to\
    \ every\n   message, with no removal of duplicates to the same sender.  This\n\
    \   requires that the Sieve engine allow an interval of zero; if it does\n   not,\
    \ and it imposes a minimum value, not every message will receive\n   an auto-reply.\n\
    \   require [\"vacation-seconds\"];\n   vacation :handle \"auto-resp\" :seconds\
    \ 0\n       \"Your request has been received.  A service\n        representative\
    \ will contact you as soon as\n        possible, usually within one business day.\"\

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Security considerations for the Sieve Vacation\
    \ extension [RFC5230]\n   apply equally here.  In addition, implementations SHOULD\
    \ consider the\n   number of auto-replies that might be generated by allowing\
    \ small\n   values of \":seconds\" (including 0), and MAY impose additional limits\n\
    \   on that number.  See the Security Considerations section of RFC 3834\n   [RFC3834]\
    \ for a fuller discussion.\n"
