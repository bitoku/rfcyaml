  - "1.  Introduction\n   Arbitrarily large sequences of values pose a problem for
    JavaScript\n   Object Notation (JSON) [RFC7159] that is well explained in the\n
    \  motivation for JSON text sequences [RFC7464].  The GeoJSON format\n   [RFC7946]
    faces the same kind of problem.  Geographic datasets often\n   run to the tens
    of thousands or millions of features.  The problem is\n   often amplified by the
    presence of large arrays of coordinates for\n   each of the features.\n   This
    document describes a specialization of JSON text sequences.  A\n   GeoJSON text
    sequence is a document of arbitrarily large size\n   containing one or more GeoJSON
    objects (e.g., multiple GeoJSON texts\n   that can be produced and parsed incrementally)
    and not just a single\n   GeoJSON FeatureCollection, Feature, or Geometry.\n"

      \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT
      RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted
      as described in\n   [RFC2119].\n"
    title: 1.1.  Requirements Language
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  GeoJSON Text Sequence Format\n   Defined in prose similar to the description
    of the JSON text sequence\n   in [RFC7464], a GeoJSON text sequence is any number
    of GeoJSON\n   [RFC7946] texts, each encoded in UTF-8 [RFC3629], preceded by one\n
    \  ASCII [RFC20] record separator (RS) character, and followed by a line\n   feed
    (LF).\n   The GeoJSON text sequence format conforms to all the rules of\n   [RFC7464]
    and adds the following constraint: each JSON text MUST\n   contain a single GeoJSON
    object as defined in [RFC7946].\n   Heterogeneous sequences containing a mix of
    GeoJSON Geometry,\n   Feature, and FeatureCollection objects are permitted.  How
    producers\n   and parsers of GeoJSON text sequences communicate rules for allowed\n
    \  GeoJSON types in exchanged sequences is not specified in this\n   document.\n"
  title: 2.  GeoJSON Text Sequence Format
- contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   GeoJSON text sequences have no security considerations
    beyond those\n   of JSON text sequences [RFC7464] and the GeoJSON format [RFC7946].\n"
  title: 3.  Security Considerations
- contents:
  - "4.  Interoperability Considerations\n   The advantage of using ASCII character
    RS \"0x1e\" to denote a text is\n   that sequence producers and parsers need not
    enforce a canonical form\n   of GeoJSON.  Any valid GeoJSON, pretty-printed or
    compact, can be\n   used in a GeoJSON text sequence.\n   A variety of parsers
    designed for newline-delimited sequences of\n   compact JSON text are deployed
    on the internet today.  While there is\n   no canonical form for JSON texts, and
    pretty-printed and compact\n   forms are equally valid, GeoJSON text sequences
    containing compact\n   GeoJSON texts with no internal newlines are more interoperable
    with\n   existing non-standardized parsers.\n   In a distributed system where
    order and exactly-once delivery of\n   messages are difficult to achieve, GeoJSON
    text sequences that do not\n   rely on order of texts for extra semantics are
    more interoperable\n   than those that do.\n"
  title: 4.  Interoperability Considerations

  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   The MIME media type for GeoJSON text sequences is
    \"application/\n   geo+json-seq\" (which uses the suffix established in [RFC8091]).
    \ IANA\n   has registered it in the \"Media Types\" registry\n   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/>.\n
