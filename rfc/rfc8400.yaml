  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC4090] describes two methods for locally protecting the\
    \ transit\n   nodes of a P2P LSP: one-to-one and facility protection.  [RFC4875]\n\
    \   specifies how these methods can be used to protect the transit nodes\n   of\
    \ a P2MP LSP.  These documents do not discuss the procedures for\n   locally protecting\
    \ the egress node(s) of an LSP.\n   This document fills that void and specifies\
    \ extensions to RSVP-TE for\n   local protection of the egress node(s) of an LSP.\
    \  \"Egress node\" and\n   \"egress\" are used interchangeably.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Local Protection of Egress Nodes
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Local Protection of Egress Nodes\n   In general, locally protecting an\
    \ egress node of an LSP means that\n   when the egress node fails, the traffic\
    \ that the LSP carries will be\n   delivered to its destination by the direct\
    \ upstream node of the\n   egress node to a backup egress node.  Without protecting\
    \ the egress\n   node of the LSP, when the egress node fails, the traffic will\
    \ be lost\n   (i.e., the traffic will not be delivered to its destination).\n\
    \   Figure 1 shows an example of using backup LSPs to locally protect\n   egress\
    \ nodes L1 and L2 of a primary P2MP LSP starting from ingress\n   node R1.  La\
    \ and Lb are the designated backup egress nodes for\n   primary egress nodes L1\
    \ and L2, respectively.  The backup LSP for\n   protecting L1 is from its upstream\
    \ node R3 to backup egress node La,\n   and the backup LSP for protecting L2 is\
    \ from R5 to Lb.\n                       *******  *******                 S Source\n\

    \                         [Lb]\n            Figure 1: Backup LSP for Locally Protecting\
    \ Egress\n   During normal operations, the traffic carried by the P2MP LSP is\
    \ sent\n   through R3 to L1, which delivers the traffic to its destination CE1.\n\
    \   When R3 detects the failure of L1, R3 switches the traffic to the\n   backup\
    \ LSP to backup egress node La, which delivers the traffic to\n   CE1.  The time\
    \ for switching the traffic is within tens of\n   milliseconds.\n   The exact\
    \ mechanism by which the failure of the primary egress node\n   is detected by\
    \ the upstream node R3 is out of the scope of this\n   document.\n   In the beginning,\
    \ the primary P2MP LSP from ingress node R1 to\n   primary egress nodes L1 and\
    \ L2 is configured.  It may be used to\n   transport the traffic from source S,\
    \ which is connected to R1, to\n   destinations CE1 and CE2, which are connected\
    \ to L1 and L2,\n   respectively.\n   To protect the primary egress nodes L1 and\
    \ L2, one configures on the\n   ingress node R1 a backup egress node for L1, another\
    \ backup egress\n   node for L2, and other options.  After the configuration,\
    \ the ingress\n   node sends a Path message for the LSP with information such\
    \ as the\n   Secondary Explicit Route Objects (SEROs), refer to Section 4.1,\n\
    \   containing the backup egress nodes for protecting the primary egress\n   nodes.\n\
    \   After receiving the Path message with the information, the upstream\n   node\
    \ of a primary egress node sets up a backup LSP to the\n   corresponding backup\
    \ egress node for protecting the primary egress\n   node.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Extensions to SERO\n   The Secondary Explicit Route Object (SERO) is defined\
    \ in [RFC4873].\n   The format of the SERO is reused.\n   The SERO used for protecting\
    \ a primary egress node of a primary LSP\n   may be added into the Path messages\
    \ for the LSP and sent from the\n   ingress node of the LSP to the upstream node\
    \ of the egress node.  It\n   contains three subobjects.\n   The first subobject\
    \ (refer to Section 4.2 of [RFC4873]) indicates the\n   branch node that is to\
    \ originate the backup LSP (to a backup egress\n   node).  The branch node is\
    \ typically the direct upstream node of the\n   primary egress node of the primary\
    \ LSP.  If the direct upstream node\n   does not support local protection against\
    \ the failure of the primary\n   egress node, the branch node can be any (upstream)\
    \ node on the\n   primary LSP.  In this case, the backup LSP from the branch node\
    \ to\n   the backup egress node protects against failures on the segment of\n\
    \   the primary LSP from the branch node to, and including, the primary\n   egress\
    \ node.\n   The second subobject is an Egress Protection subobject, which is a\n\
    \   PROTECTION object with a new C-Type (3).  The format of the Egress\n   Protection\

    \   E-Flags are defined for local protection of egress nodes.\n   Bit 31 (\"egress\
    \ local protection\" flag):  It is the least significant\n      bit of the 32-bit\
    \ word and is set to 1, which indicates that local\n      protection of egress\
    \ nodes is desired.\n   Bit 30 (\"S2L sub-LSP backup desired\" flag):  It is the\
    \ second least\n      significant bit of the 32-bit word and is set to 1, which\n\
    \      indicates an S2L sub-LSP (refer to [RFC4875]) is desired for\n      protecting\
    \ an egress node of a P2MP LSP.\n   The Reserved parts MUST be set to zero on\
    \ transmission and MUST be\n   ignored on receipt.\n   Four optional subobjects\
    \ are defined: they are IPv4 and IPv6 primary\n   egress node subobjects as well\
    \ as IPv4 and IPv6 P2P LSP ID\n   subobjects.  IPv4 and IPv6 primary egress node\
    \ subobjects indicate\n   the IPv4 and IPv6 address of the primary egress node,\
    \ respectively.\n   IPv4 and IPv6 P2P LSP ID subobjects contain the information\
    \ for\n   identifying IPv4 and IPv6 backup P2P LSP tunnels, respectively.\n  \

    \ the subobject in bytes, including Type, Length, and Contents fields.\n   The\
    \ Reserved field MUST be set to zero on transmission and MUST be\n   ignored on\
    \ receipt.\n   The third (final) subobject (refer to Section 4.2 of [RFC4873])\
    \ in\n   the SERO contains the egress node of the backup LSP, i.e., the\n   address\
    \ of the backup egress node in the place of the merge node.\n   After the upstream\
    \ node of the primary egress node (a.k.a. the branch\n   node) receives the SERO\
    \ and determines a backup egress node for the\n   primary egress node, it computes\
    \ a path from itself to the backup\n   egress node and sets up a backup LSP along\
    \ the path for protecting\n   the primary egress node according to the information\
    \ in the\n   FAST_REROUTE object in the Path message.  For example, if facility\n\
    \   protection is desired, it is provided for the primary egress node.\n   The\
    \ upstream node constructs a new SERO based on the SERO received\n   and adds\
    \ the new SERO into the Path message for the backup LSP.  The\n   new SERO also\
    \ contains three subobjects as the SERO for the primary\n   LSP.  The first subobject\
    \ in the new SERO indicates the upstream\n   node, which may be copied from the\
    \ first subobject in the SERO\n   received.  The second subobject in the new SERO\
    \ includes a primary\n   egress node, which indicates the address of the primary\
    \ egress node.\n   The third one contains the backup egress node.\n   The upstream\
    \ node updates the SERO in the Path message for the\n   primary LSP.  The Egress\
    \ Protection subobject in the SERO contains a\n   subobject called a P2P LSP ID\
    \ subobject, which contains the\n   information for identifying the backup LSP.\

    \ node and backup egress node are\n   considered as a \"virtual node\".  Note\
    \ that the backup egress node is\n   different from this local address (e.g.,\
    \ from the primary egress\n   node's point of view).  In other words, it is identified\

    \ node in the Resv message according to the status of\n   the primary egress node\

    \ which\n   delivers the traffic to CE2 using the VPN label.\n   When the primary\
    \ egress node L1 fails, its upstream node R3 detects\n   it and switches the VPN\
    \ traffic from the primary LSP to the backup\n   LSP to La, which delivers the\
    \ traffic to CE2 using the backup LSP\n   label as a context label to get the\
    \ LFIB for L1 and the VPN label as\n   a UA label to find the forwarding entry\
    \ in the LFIB to forward the\n   traffic to CE2.\n"

  - "6.2.  PLR Procedure for Applications\n   When the PLR gets a backup LSP from\
    \ itself to a backup egress node\n   for protecting a primary egress node of a\
    \ primary LSP, it includes an\n   SERO object in the Path message for the primary\
    \ LSP.  The object\n   contains the ID information of the backup LSP and indicates\
    \ that the\n   primary egress node sends the backup egress node the application\n\
    \   traffic label (e.g., the VPN label) as a UA label when needed.\n"

  - "6.3.  Egress Procedures for Applications\n   When a primary egress node of an\
    \ LSP sends the ingress node of the\n   LSP a label for an application such as\
    \ a VPN label, it sends the\n   label (as a UA label) to the backup egress node\
    \ for protecting the\n   primary egress node.  Exactly how the label is sent is\
    \ out of scope\n   for this document.\n   When the backup egress node receives\
    \ a UA label from the primary\n   egress node, it adds a forwarding entry with\
    \ the label into the LFIB\n   for the primary egress node.  When the backup egress\
    \ node receives a\n   packet from the backup LSP, it uses the top label as a context\
    \ label\n   to find the LFIB for the primary egress node and uses the inner label\n\
    \   to deliver the packet to the same destination as the primary egress\n   node\
    \ according to the LFIB.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This document builds upon existing work, specifically,\
    \ the security\n   considerations of [RFC4090], [RFC4875], [RFC3209], and [RFC2205]\n\
    \   continue to apply.  Additionally, protecting a primary egress node of\n  \
    \ a P2P LSP carrying service traffic through a backup egress node\n   requires\
    \ out-of-band communication between the primary egress node\n   and the backup\
    \ egress node in order for the primary egress node to\n   convey a service label\
    \ as a UA label and also convey its related\n   forwarding information to the\
    \ backup egress node.  It is important to\n   confirm that the identifiers used\
    \ to identify the primary and backup\n   egress nodes in the LSP are verified\
    \ to match with the identifiers\n   used in the out-of-band protocol (such as\
    \ BGP).\n"
