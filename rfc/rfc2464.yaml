    on an Ethernet is 1500\n   octets.  This size may be reduced by a Router Advertisement
    [DISC]\n   containing an MTU option which specifies a smaller MTU, or by manual\n
    \  configuration of each node.  If a Router Advertisement received on an\n   Ethernet
    interface has an MTU option specifying an MTU larger than\n   1500, or larger
    than a manually configured value, that MTU option may\n   be logged to system
    management but must be otherwise ignored.\n   For purposes of this document, information
    received from DHCP is\n   considered \"manually configured\" and the term Ethernet
    includes\n   CSMA/CD and full-duplex subnetworks based on ISO/IEC 8802-3, with\n
    \  various data rates.\n"

  - "4.  Stateless Autoconfiguration\n   The Interface Identifier [AARCH] for an Ethernet
    interface is based\n   on the EUI-64 identifier [EUI64] derived from the interface's
    built-\n   in 48-bit IEEE 802 address.  The EUI-64 is formed as follows.\n   (Canonical
    bit order is assumed throughout.)\n   The OUI of the Ethernet address (the first
    three octets) becomes the\n   company_id of the EUI-64 (the first three octets).
    \ The fourth and\n   fifth octets of the EUI are set to the fixed value FFFE hexadecimal.\n
    \  The last three octets of the Ethernet address become the last three\n   octets
    of the EUI-64.\n   The Interface Identifier is then formed from the EUI-64 by\n
    \  complementing the \"Universal/Local\" (U/L) bit, which is the next-to-\n   lowest
    order bit of the first octet of the EUI-64.  Complementing\n   this bit will generally
    change a 0 value to a 1, since an interface's\n   built-in address is expected
    to be from a universally administered\n   address space and hence have a globally
    unique value.  A universally\n   administered IEEE 802 address or an EUI-64 is
    signified by a 0 in the\n   U/L bit position, while a globally unique IPv6 Interface
    Identifier\n   is signified by a 1 in the corresponding position.  For further\n
    \  discussion on this point, see [AARCH].\n   For example, the Interface Identifier
    for an Ethernet interface whose\n   built-in address is, in hexadecimal,\n                             34-56-78-9A-BC-DE\n
    \  would be\n                         36-56-78-FF-FE-9A-BC-DE.\n   A different
    MAC address set manually or by software should not be\n   used to derive the Interface
    Identifier.  If such a MAC address must\n   be used, its global uniqueness property
    should be reflected in the\n   value of the U/L bit.\n   An IPv6 address prefix
    used for stateless autoconfiguration [ACONF]\n   of an Ethernet interface must
    have a length of 64 bits.\n"
