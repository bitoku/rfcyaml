    \ 94025                                23 May 1973\nEnterprise Phone Service to\
    \ NIC From ARPANET Sites\nIn September 1971, NIC arranged for all Sites then on\
    \ the Network to\nhave phone service to NIC with all tolls billed to NIC. (7554,).\
    \ In\nOctober, (7732,) a revised list of numbers established for Sites was\nissued.\
    \ Since then, some Sites have requested the service, and further\narrangements\
    \ have been made.  A list of present Enterprise and Zenith\nnumbers is attached.\
    \  This list is accessible online through\n<NIC>LOCATOR.\nwould be much more expensive.\
    \ Enterprise numbers (Zenith in California)\nare billing arrangements which must\
    \ be made separately for each prefix,\nnot just each area code, so that even users\
    \ in the same area usually\nneed a special arrangement. Although admittedly more\
    \ awkward than an 800\nnumber, the present arrangement costs about $800 per month;\
    \ an 800\nnumber would cost about $2200 per month.\nwith the present arrangement.\
    \ Any Site actually on the Network which\ndoes not have an Enterprise number and\
    \ would like to have one, is\ninvited to call NIC to request one.\nnumbers for\
    \ calls that are received from 5pm to 8am. We apologize to any\nusers who have\
    \ found this service faulty recently. We have reinstituted\nthe service and assume\
    \ it will be satisfactory in supplying information\non the status of NIC operations\
    \ at times other than 8 to 5 when our full\nstaff is here. Your comments on this\
    \ would be appreciated.\nIdent                   Site                    Phone\n\
