  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the MIME header Content-Duration\
    \ that is\n   intended for use with any time varying media content (typically\n\
    \   audio/* or video/*).  The length of time is represented in seconds\n   without\
    \ any units indication.  This document obsoletes RFC 2424.\n   The key words \"\
    MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\",\
    \ \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document\
    \ are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [REQ].\n"
- title: 2.  Content-Duration Header Field
  contents:
  - "2.  Content-Duration Header Field\n   Time varying media contents, for example,\
    \ a spoken voice message or a\n   video clip, have an inherent time duration.\
    \  Many audio and video\n   encodings may include their duration as header information\
    \ or may\n   allow accurate calculation based on the byte length of the data.\n\
    \   However, it may be useful to present the time duration of the content\n  \
    \ in a MIME header to allow its simple determination without dealing\n   with\
    \ the actual content.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Syntax
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Syntax\n   The Content-Duration field's value is a single number specifying\
    \ the\n   time duration in seconds of the content.  Formally:\n   duration :=\
    \ \"Content-Duration\" \":\" 1*10DIGIT\n   Note that practically (though highly\
    \ unlikely in MIME media), the\n   upper bound on the numerical value of the time\
    \ duration is (2^^31 -1)\n   or 2147483647.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Semantics
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Semantics\n   This field represents the time duration of the associated\
    \ time\n   varying media content.  The time duration is noted in seconds with\
    \ no\n   units tag. The time value should be exact, however the exact value of\n\
    \   the time duration cannot be known without opening the content and\n   playing\
    \ it.  If an exact value must be known, then the latter method\n   should be used.\
    \ This mechanism simply allows placing a sender\n   determined time duration value\
    \ in the header for easy access.\n   Though there are several ways to present\
    \ this duration to the\n   recipient (e.g., with the inbox headers, when audio\
    \ attachment\n   opened), the actual use of this field on reception is a local\n\
    \   implementation issue.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Example
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Example\n   In this example the content duration represents 33 seconds:\n\
    \         Content-Duration: 33\n"
- title: 3.  VPIM Usage
  contents:
  - "3.  VPIM Usage\n   The Content-Duration header field for the audio/32KADPCM sub-type\
    \ is\n   a useful component of the VPIM specification [VPIM2].  All VPIM\n   Messages\
    \ MUST contain this sub-type to carry the audio of a voice\n   message.  It may\
    \ be useful in some instances (e.g., viewing on a\n   simple MIME or non-MIME\
    \ desktop) to have the time duration of the\n   voice message available without\
    \ having to open the audio content.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This definition introduces the option of explicitly\
    \ identifying the\n   time duration of an audio/* or video/* content outside of\
    \ the binary\n   data that forms the content.  In some environments (though likely\
    \ not\n   the majority), the identification of the actual time duration in a\n\
    \   header field may be a security issue and as a result should not be\n   noted.\
    \ Reliance on the time indicated in this header field cannot be\n   trusted for\
    \ the purposes of determining the exact size of the data.\n   The exact length\
    \ of the data must be determined by examining the data\n   itself.\n"
