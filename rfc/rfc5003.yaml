- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC4447] defines the signaling mechanisms for establishing\
    \ point-\n   to-point pseudowires (PWs) between two provider edge (PE) nodes.\n\
    \   When a PW is set up, the LDP signaling messages include a forwarding\n   equivalence\
    \ class (FEC) element containing information about the PW\n   type and an endpoint\
    \ identifier used in the selection of the PW\n   forwarder that binds the PW to\
    \ the attachment circuit at each end.\n   There are two types of FEC elements\
    \ defined for this purpose: PWid\n   FEC (type 128) and the Generalized ID (GID)\
    \ FEC (type 129).  The PWid\n   FEC element includes a fixed-length 32-bit value\
    \ called the PWid that\n   serves as an endpoint identifier.  The same PWid value\
    \ must be\n   configured on the local and remote PE prior to PW setup.\n   The\
    \ GID FEC element includes TLV fields for attachment individual\n   identifiers\
    \ (AIIs) that, in conjunction with an attachment group\n   identifier (AGI), serve\
    \ as PW endpoint identifiers.  The endpoint\n   identifier on the local PE (denoted\
    \ as <AGI, source AII, or SAII>) is\n   called the source attachment identifier\
    \ (SAI) and the endpoint\n   identifier on the remote PE (denoted as <AGI, target\
    \ AII, or TAII>)\n   is called the target attachment identifier (TAI).  The SAI\
    \ and TAI\n   can be distinct values.  This is useful for applications and\n \
    \  provisioning models where the local PE (with a particular SAI) does\n   not\
    \ know and must somehow learn (e.g., via Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP)\n   auto-discovery)\
    \ of remote TAI values prior to launching PW setup\n   messages towards the remote\
    \ PE.\n   The use of the GID FEC TLV provides the flexibility to structure\n \
    \  (source or target) AII values to best fit the needs of a particular\n   application\
    \ or provisioning model [L2VPN-SIG].  For example, an AII\n   structure that enables\
    \ many individual AII values to be identified as\n   a single value could significantly\
    \ reduce the burden on AII\n   distribution mechanisms (e.g., MP-BGP) and on PE\
    \ memory needed to\n   store this AII information.  It should be noted that Pseudowire\n\
    \   Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) signaling messages will always include\n   a\
    \ fully qualified AII value.\n   An AII that is globally unique would facilitate\
    \ PW management and\n   security in large inter-AS (autonomous system) and inter-provider\n\
    \   environments.  Providers would not have to worry about AII value\n   overlap\
    \ during provisioning or the need for AII network address\n   translation (NAT)\
    \ boxes during signaling.  Globally unique AII values\n   could aid in troubleshooting\
    \ and could be subjected to source-\n   validity checks during AII distribution\
    \ and signaling.  An AII\n   automatically derived from a provider's existing\
    \ IP address space can\n   simplify the provisioning process.\n   This document\
    \ defines an AII structure based on [RFC4447] that:\n     o Enables many discrete\
    \ attachment individual identifiers to be\n       summarized into a single AII\
    \ summary value.  This will enhance\n       scalability by reducing the burden\
    \ on AII distribution mechanisms\n       and on PE memory.\n     o Ensures global\
    \ uniqueness if desired by the provider.  This will\n       facilitate Internet-wide\
    \ PW connectivity and provide a means for\n       providers to perform source\
    \ validation on the AII distribution\n       (e.g., MP-BGP) and signaling (e.g.,\
    \ LDP) channels.\n   This is accomplished by defining new AII types and the associated\n\
    \   formats of the value field.\n"

    \ is unique on the local PE.\n"
- title: 3.2.  AII Type 2
  contents:
  - "3.2.  AII Type 2\n   The AII Type 2 structure permits varying levels of AII summarization\n\
    \   to take place, thus reducing the scaling burden on the aforementioned\n  \
    \ AII distribution mechanisms and PE memory.  In other words, it no\n   longer\
    \ becomes necessary to distribute or configure all individual\n   AII values (which\
    \ could number in the tens of thousands or more) on\n   local PEs prior to establishing\
    \ PWs to remote PEs.  The details of\n   how and where the aggregation of AII\
    \ values is performed and then\n   distributed as AII reachability information\
    \ are not discussed in this\n   document.\n   AII Type 2 uses a combination of\
    \ a provider's globally unique\n   identifier (Global ID), a 32-bit prefix field,\
    \ and a 4-octet\n   attachment circuit identifier (AC ID) field to create globally\
    \ unique\n   AII values.\n   The encoding of AII Type 2 is shown in Figure 1.\n\

    \     o Length = length of value field in octets.  The length is set to\n    \
    \   12.\n     o Global ID = This is a 4-octet field containing a value that is\n\
    \       unique to the provider.  The global ID can contain the 2-octet or\n  \
    \     4-octet value of the provider's Autonomous System Number (ASN).\n      \
    \ It is expected that the global ID will be derived from the\n       globally\
    \ unique ASN of the autonomous system hosting the PEs\n       containing the actual\
    \ AIIs.  The presence of a global ID based on\n       the provider's ASN ensures\
    \ that the AII will be globally unique.\n       If the global ID is derived from\
    \ a 2-octet AS number, then the\n       two high-order octets of this 4-octet\
    \ field MUST be set to zero.\n       Please note that the use of the provider's\
    \ ASN as a global ID\n       DOES NOT have anything at all to do with the use\
    \ of the ASN in\n       protocols such as BGP.\n     o Prefix = The 32-bit prefix\
    \ is a value assigned by the provider or\n       it can be automatically derived\
    \ from the PE's /32 IPv4 loopback\n       address.  Note that, for IP reachability,\
    \ it is not required that\n       the 32-bit prefix have any association with\
    \ the IPv4 address\n       space used in the provider's IGP or BGP.\n     o Attachment\
    \ Circuit (AC) ID = This is a fixed-length 4-octet field\n       used to further\
    \ refine identification of an attachment circuit on\n       the PE.  The inclusion\
    \ of the AC ID is used to identify\n       individual attachment circuits that\
    \ share a common prefix.\n"

    \ [L2VPN-SIG] and PW\n   signaling protocols [RFC4447] and are subject to various\n\
    \   authentication schemes (i.e., MD5) if so desired.\n   The use of global ID\
    \ values (e.g., ASN) in the inter-provider case\n   could enable a form of source-validation\
    \ checking to ensure that the\n   AII value (aggregated or explicit) originated\
    \ from a legitimate\n   source.\n"
