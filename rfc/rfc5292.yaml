  title: Status of This Memo
- contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type for\n
    \  BGP, termed \"Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter\", that can be used\n   to
    perform address-prefix-based route filtering.  This ORF-type\n   supports prefix-length-
    or range-based matching, wild-card-based\n   address prefix matching, as well
    as the exact address prefix matching\n   for address families.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Outbound Route Filtering Capability defined in [BGP-ORF]
    provides\n   a mechanism for a BGP speaker to send to its BGP peer a set of\n
    \  Outbound Route Filters (ORFs) that can be used by its peer to filter\n   its
    outbound routing updates to the speaker.\n   This documents defines a new ORF-type
    for BGP, termed \"Address Prefix\n   Outbound Route Filter (Address Prefix ORF)\",
    that can be used to\n   perform address-prefix-based route filtering.  The Address
    Prefix ORF\n   supports prefix-length- or range-based matching, wild-card-based\n
    \  address prefix matching, as well as the exact address prefix matching\n   for
    address families [BGP-MP].\n"

  - "2.  Address Prefix ORF-Type\n   The Address Prefix ORF-Type allows one to express
    ORFs in terms of\n   address prefixes.  That is, it provides address-prefix-based
    route\n   filtering, including prefix-length- or range-based matching, as well\n
    \  as wild-card address prefix matching.\n   Conceptually, an Address Prefix ORF
    entry consists of the fields\n   <Sequence, Match, Length, Prefix, Minlen, Maxlen>.\n
    \  The \"Sequence\" field specifies the relative ordering of the entry\n   among
    all the Address Prefix ORF entries.\n   The \"Match\" field specifies whether
    this entry is \"PERMIT\" (value 0)\n   or \"DENY\" (value 1).\n   The \"Length\"
    field indicates the length (in bits) of the address\n   prefix.  A length of zero
    indicates a prefix that matches all (as\n   specified by the address family) addresses
    (with the prefix itself of\n   zero octets).\n   The \"Prefix\" field contains
    an address prefix of an address family.\n   The \"Minlen\" field indicates the
    minimum prefix length (in bits) that\n   is required for \"matching\".  The field
    is considered unspecified with\n   a value of 0.\n   The \"Maxlen\" field indicates
    the maximum prefix length (in bits) that\n   is required for \"matching\".  The
    field is considered unspecified with\n   a value of 0.\n   The fields \"Sequence\",
    \"Length\", \"Minlen\", and \"Maxlen\" are all\n   unsigned integers.\n   This
    document imposes the following requirement on the values of\n   these fields:\n
    \        0 <= Length < Minlen <= Maxlen\n   However, tests related to the \"Minlen\"
    or \"Maxlen\" value should be\n   omitted when the \"Minlen\" or \"Maxlen\" field
    (respectively) is\n   unspecified.\n   In addition, the \"Maxlen\" value must
    be no more than the maximum\n   length (in bits) of a host address for a given
    address family\n   [BGP-MP].\n"

  - "3.  Address Prefix ORF Encoding\n   The value of the ORF-Type for the Address
    Prefix ORF-Type is 64.\n   An Address Prefix ORF entry is encoded as follows.
    \ The \"Match\" field\n   of the entry is encoded in the \"Match\" field of the
    common part\n   [BGP-ORF], and the remaining fields of the entry are encoded in
    the\n   \"Type specific part\", as shown in Figure 1.\n         +--------------------------------+\n
    \        |   Sequence (4 octets)          |\n         +--------------------------------+\n
    \        |   Minlen   (1 octet)           |\n         +--------------------------------+\n

    \        Figure 1: Address Prefix ORF Encoding\n   Note that the \"Prefix\" field
    contains the address prefix followed by\n   enough trailing bits to make the end
    of the field fall on an octet\n   boundary.  The value of the trailing bits is
    irrelevant.\n"

  - "4.  Address Prefix ORF Matching\n   In addition to the general matching rules
    defined in [BGP-ORF],\n   several Address-Prefix-ORF-specific matching rules are
    defined as\n   follows.\n   Consider an Address Prefix ORF entry, and a route
    maintained by a BGP\n   speaker with Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)
    in the\n   form of <Prefix, Length>.\n   The route is considered as \"no match\"
    to the ORF entry if the NLRI is\n   neither more specific than, nor equal to,
    the <Prefix, Length> fields\n   of the ORF entry.\n   When the NLRI is either
    more specific than, or equal to, the <Prefix,\n   Length> fields of the ORF entry,
    the route is considered as a match\n   to the ORF entry only if the NLRI match
    condition as listed in Table\n   1 is satisfied.\n             ORF Entry                  NLRI\n
    \       Minlen      Maxlen         Match Condition\n      +------------------------------------------------------+\n
    \     | un-spec.    un-spec.       NLRI.length == ORF.length |\n      +------------------------------------------------------+\n
    \     | specified   un-spec.       NLRI.length >= ORF.Minlen |\n      +------------------------------------------------------+\n
    \     | un-spec.    specified      NLRI.length <= ORF.Maxlen |\n      +------------------------------------------------------+\n
    \     | specified   specified      NLRI.length >= ORF.Minlen |\n      |                        AND
    NLRI.length <= ORF.Maxlen |\n      +------------------------------------------------------+\n
    \     Table 1: Address Prefix ORF Matching\n   When more than one Address Prefix
    ORF entry matches the NLRI of the\n   route, the \"first-match\" rule applies.
    \ That is, the ORF entry with\n   the smallest sequence number (among all the
    matching ORF entries) is\n   considered as the sole match, and it would determine
    whether the\n   route should be advertised.\n   The assignment of the sequence
    numbers is a local matter for the BGP\n   speaker that sends the Address Prefix
    ORF entries.\n"
