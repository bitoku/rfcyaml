    \ NWG/RFC 10 and 16.\nThe Network Working Group consists of interested people\
    \ from existing or\npotential ARPA network sites.  Membership is not closed.\n\
    The Network Working Group (NWG) is concerned with the HOST software,\nthe strategies\
    \ for using the network, and initial experience with the\nnetwork.\nDocumentation\
    \ of the NWG's effort is through notes such as this.  Notes\nmay be produced at\
    \ any site by and included in this series.\nCONTENT\nThe content of a NWG note\
    \ may be any thought, suggestion, etc. related\nto the HOST software or other\
    \ aspect of the network.  Notes are\nencouraged to be timely rather than polished.\
    \  Philosophical positions\nwithout examples or other specifics, specific suggestions\
    \ or\nimplementation techniques without introductory or background explication,\n\
    and explicit questions without any attempted answers are all acceptable.\nThe\
    \ minimum length for a NWG note is one sentence.\nThese standards (or lack of\
    \ them) are stated explicitly for two reasons.\nFirst, there is a tendency to\
    \ view a written statement as ipso facto\nauthoritative, and we hope to promote\
    \ the exchange and discussion of\nconsiderably less than authoritative ideas.\
    \  Second, there is a natural\nhesitancy to publish something unpolished, and\
    \ we hope to ease this\ninhibition.\nFORM\nEvery NWG note should bear the following\
    \ information:\n        1.  \"Network Working Group\"\n            \"Request for\
    \ Comnments: X\" (X underscored)\n              where X is a serial number.  Serial\
    \ numbers are\n              assigned by Steve Crocker at UCLA.\n        2.  Author\
