Abstract When experimenting with or extending protocols, it is often necessary to use some sort of protocol number or constant in order to actually test or experiment with the new function, even when testing in a closed environment.
This document reserves some ranges of numbers for experimentation purposes in specific protocols where the need to support experimentation has been identified, and it describes the numbers that have already been reserved by other documents.
Introduction [RFC3692] recommends assigning option numbers for experiments and testing.
This document documents several such assignments for the number spaces whose IANA considerations are documented in [RFC2780].
This document generally follows the form of [RFC2780].
When using these values, carefully consider the advice in Sections 1 and 1.1 of [RFC3692].
It is not appropriate to simply select one of these values and hard code it into a system.
Note: while [RFC3692] says that it may not be necessary to allocate values for UDP and TCP ports, Sections 6 and 7.1 explicitly reserve ports for this purpose to avoid any possible conflict.
Fields in the IPv4 Header
The IPv4 header [RFC0791] contains the following fields that carry values assigned by the IANA:
Version, Type of Service, Protocol, Source Address, Destination Address, and Option Type.
IP Version Field in the IPv4 Header
The Version field in IPv4 packets is always 4. 2.2.
IPv4 Type of Service Field [RFC2474] defines Pool 2 (all code points xxxx11, where 'x' refers to either '0' or '1')
as Experimental/Local Use, so no additional code points should be needed.
The Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) field [RFC3168] has no free code points to assign.
allocates two experimental code points (253 and 254) for the IPv4 Protocol field.
IPv4 Source and Destination Addresses 2.4.1.
No experimental IPv4 addresses are defined.
For certain experiments, the address ranges set aside for Private Internets in [RFC1918]
It is not appropriate to use other special purpose IPv4 addresses [RFC3330] for experimentation.
At the time of this writing, some Internet Registries have policies allowing experimental assignments from number spaces that they control.
Depending on the experiment, the registry, and their policy, this may be an appropriate path to pursue.
The globally routable group 224.0.1.20 is set aside for experimentation.
For certain experiments, the administratively scoped multicast groups defined in [RFC2365] may be useful.
This document assigns a single link local scoped group, 224.0.0.254, and a single scope relative group, 254.
This document assigns a single option number, with all defined values of the "copy" and "class" fields, resulting in four distinct option type codes.
See Section 8 for the assigned values.
The IPv6 header [RFC2460] contains the following fields that carry values assigned from IANA managed name spaces: Version, Traffic Class, Next Header, Source and Destination Address.
In addition, the IPv6 Hop by Hop Options and
Destination Options extension headers include an Option Type field with values assigned from an IANA  managed name space.
The IPv6 Routing Header contains a Type field for which there is not currently an explicit IANA assignment policy.
IP Version Field in the IPv6
The Version field in IPv6 packets is always 6.
IPv6 Traffic Class Field [RFC2474]
defines Pool 2 (all code points xxxx11, where 'x' refers to either '0' or '1')
as Experimental/Local Use, so no additional code points should be needed.
The ECN field [RFC3168] has no free code points to assign.
[RFC3692] allocates two experimental code points (253 and 254) for the IPv6 Next Header field.
Source and Destination Addresses 3.4.1.
Unicast Addresses [RFC2928] defines a set of IPv6 addresses for testing and experimental usage: The block of Sub TLA IDs assigned to the IANA (i.e., 2001:0000::/29 2001:01F8::/29) is for assignment for testing and experimental usage to support activities such as the 6bone, and for new approaches like exchanges.
However, at this writing, there are no RFC3692 style experimental IPv6 addresses assigned.
[HUSTON05] creates an IANA registry that may in the future contain such assignments.
For certain experiments, Unique Local Addresses [RFC4193] may be useful.
It is not appropriate to use addresses in the documentation prefix [RFC3849] for experimentation.
At the time of this writing, some Internet Registries have policies allowing experimental assignments from number spaces that they control.
Depending on the experiment, the registry, and their policy, this may be an appropriate path to pursue.
The group FF0X::114 is set aside for experimentation at all scope levels.
Smaller scopes may be particularly useful for experimentation, since they are defined not to leak out of a given defined boundary, which can be set to be the boundary of the experiment.
For certain experiments, other multicast addresses with the T
(non permanently assigned or "transient" address) bit [RFC4291] set may be useful.
Hop and Destination Option Fields
This document assigns a single option type, with all possible values of the "act" and "chg" fields, resulting in eight distinct option type codes.
See Section 8 for the assigned values.
IPv6 Routing Header Routing Type
This document assigns two values for the Routing Type field in the IPv6 Routing Header, 253 and 254. 4.
Fields in the IPv4 ICMP Header
This document assigns two ICMPv4 type numbers, 253 and 254.
ICMPv4 code values are allocated per type, so it's not feasible to assign experimental values in this document.
Fields in the IPv6 ICMP Header [RFC4443] includes experimental ICMPv6 type values for Informational (200, 201) and Error (100, 101)
code values are allocated per type, so it's not feasible to assign experimental values in this document.
The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery header [RFC2461] contains the following fields that carry values assigned from IANA managed name spaces: Type, Code, and Option Type.
The Neighbor Discovery Type field is the same as the ICMPv6 Type field.
See Section 5 for those code points.
The ICMPv6 Code field is not used in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, so no experimental code points are necessary.
IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option Type
This document assigns two IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option Types, 253 and 254.
Fields in the UDP Header Two system ports, 1021 and 1022, have been reserved for experimentation for UDP and TCP.
Fields in the TCP Header 7.1.
TCP Source and Destination Port
Two system ports, 1021 and 1022, have been reserved for experimentation for UDP and TCP.
Reserved Bits in TCP Header
There are not enough reserved bits to allocate any for experimentation.
Kind Field Two TCP options, 253 and 254, have been reserved for experimentation with TCP Options.
The new assignments are summarized below.
IPv4 Multicast Addresses (multicast addresses (224.0.0/24)
Local Network Control Block section) (Section 2.4.2)
222 IPv6 Option Types (ipv6 parameters Section 5.b.)
IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option Formats (icmpv6 parameters) (Section 5.1.3)
253  RFC3692 style Experiment 1 ( )
( ) IPv6 Routing Header Routing Types (ipv6 parameters Section 5.c.)
253  RFC3692 style Experiment 1 ( )
( ) ICMPv4 Type Numbers (icmp parameters) (Section 4)
253  RFC3692 style Experiment 1 ( )
/udp RFC3692 style Experiment 1
exp1    1021/tcp RFC3692 style Experiment 1
exp2    1022/udp RFC3692 style Experiment 2
exp2    1022/tcp RFC3692 style Experiment 2
( ) TCP Option Numbers (tcp parameters) (Section 7.3)
RFC3692 style Experiment 1 ( )
It is only appropriate to use these values in explicitly  configured experiments; they MUST NOT be shipped as defaults in implementations.
See RFC 3692 for details.
Security Considerations Production networks do not necessarily support the use of experimental code points in IP headers.
The network scope of support for experimental values should carefully be evaluated before deploying any experiment across extended network domains, such as the public Internet.
The potential to disrupt the stable operation of the network hosting the experiment through the use of unsupported experimental code points is a serious consideration when planning an experiment using such code points.
Security analyzers such as firewalls and network intrusion detection monitors often rely on unambiguous interpretations of the fields described in this memo.
As new values for the fields are assigned, existing security analyzers that do not understand the new values may fail, resulting in either loss of connectivity, if the analyzer declines to forward the unrecognized traffic, or in loss of security if it does forward the traffic and the new values are used as part of an attack.
Assigning known values for experiments can allow such analyzers to take a known action for explicitly experimental traffic.
Because the experimental IPv4 options defined in Section 2.5 are not included in the IPsec AH [RFC4302] calculations, it is not possible for one to authenticate their use.
Experimenters ought to keep this in mind when designing their experiments.
Users of the experimental IPv6 options defined in Section 3.5 can choose whether or not the option is included in the AH calculations by choosing the value of the "chg" field.
When experimental code points are deployed within an administratively self contained network domain, the network administrators should ensure that each code point is used consistently to avoid interference between experiments.
When experimental code points are used in traffic that crosses multiple administrative domains, the experimenters should assume that there is a risk that the same code points will be used simultaneously by other experiments and thus that there is a possibility that the experiments will interfere.
Particular attention should be given to security threats that such interference might create.
