- title: 2.  The SNMP Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  The SNMP Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently\
    \ consists of five major\n   components:\n   o  An overall architecture, described\
    \ in RFC 2571 [1].\n   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events\
    \ for the\n      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of\n\
    \      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and is described in\n    \
    \  STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3], and RFC 1215 [4].  The\n      second\
    \ version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578\n      [5], RFC 2579\
    \ [6], and RFC 2580 [7].\n   o  Message protocols for transferring management\
    \ information.  The\n      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called\
    \ SNMPv1 and is\n      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second version of\
    \ the SNMP\n      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track\n\
    \      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described is in RFC 1901 [9] and\n    \
    \  RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is\n      called\
    \ SNMPv3 and is described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11],\n      and RFC 2574\
    \ [12].\n   o  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The\n\
    \      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is\n      described\
    \ in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second set of protocol\n      operations and associated\
    \ PDU formats is described in RFC 1905\n      [13].\n   o  A set of fundamental\
    \ applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and\n      the view-based access control\
    \ mechanism described in RFC 2575\n      [15].\n   A more detailed introduction\
    \ to the current SNMP Management Framework\n   can be found in RFC 2570 [16].\n\
    \   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the\
    \ Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n   defined using\
    \ the mechanisms defined in the SMI.\n   This memo specifies a MIB module that\
    \ is compliant to the SMIv2.  A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced\
    \ through the appropriate\n   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must\
    \ be semantically\n   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because\
    \ no\n   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable\n\
    \   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in\n   SMIv1\
    \ during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine\n   readable\
    \ information is not considered to change the semantics of the\n   MIB.\n   The\
    \ key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\
    \   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in\
    \ this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [17].\n"

  contents:
  - "4.4.  Counters, Interval Buckets and Thresholds\n   For SNR Margin, Loop Attenuation,\
    \ ES, SES, CRC anomalies, LOSW, and\n   UAS, there are event counters, current\
    \ 15-minute and 0 to 96 15-\n   minute history bucket(s) of \"interval-counters\"\
    , as well as current\n   and 0 to 30 previous 1-day interval-counter(s).  Each\
    \ current 15-\n   minute event bucket has an associated threshold notification.\n\
    \   Unlike RFC 2493 [22] and RFC 2662 [23], there is no representation in\n  \
    \ the MIB for invalid buckets.  In those cases where the data for an\n   interval\
    \ is suspect or known to be invalid, the agent MUST NOT report\n   the interval.\
    \  If the current 15-minute event bucket is determined to\n   be invalid, notifications\
    \ based upon the value of the event bucket\n   MUST NOT be generated.\n   Not\
    \ reporting an interval will result in holes in the associated\n   table.  For\
    \ example, the table, hdsl2Shdsl15MinIntervalTable, is\n   indexed by { ifIndex,\
    \ hdsl2ShdslInvIndex, hdsl2ShdslEndpointSide,\n   hdsl2ShdslEndpointWirePair,\
    \ hdsl2Shdsl15MinIntervalNumber}.  If\n   interval 12 is determined to be invalid\
    \ but intervals 11 and 13 are\n   valid, a Get Next operation on the indices .1.1.1.1.11\
    \ would return\n   indices .1.1.1.1.13.\n   There is no requirement for an agent\
    \ to ensure a fixed relationship\n   between the start of a fifteen minute interval\
    \ and any wall clock;\n   however some implementations may align the fifteen minute\
    \ intervals\n   with quarter hours.  Likewise, an implementation may choose to\
    \ align\n   one day intervals with the start of a day.\n   Counters are not reset\
    \ when an xU is reinitialized, only when the\n   agent is reset or reinitialized\
    \ (or under specific request outside\n   the scope of this MIB).\n"
- title: 4.5.  Profiles
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Profiles\n   As a managed node can handle a large number of xUs, (e.g.,\
    \ hundreds\n   or perhaps thousands of lines), provisioning every parameter on\
    \ every\n   xU may become burdensome.  Moreover, most lines are provisioned\n\
    \   identically with the same set of parameters.  To simplify the\n   provisioning\
    \ process, this MIB makes use of profiles.  A profile is a\n   set of parameters\
    \ that can be shared by multiple lines using the same\n   configuration.\n   The\
    \ following profiles are used in this MIB:\n   o  Span Configuration Profiles\
    \ - Span configuration profiles contain\n      parameters for configuring HDSL2/SHDSL\
    \ spans.  They are defined in\n      the hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfileTable.  Since\
    \ span configuration\n      parameters are only applicable for SHDSL, the support\
    \ for span\n      configuration profiles are optional for HDSL2 interfaces.\n\
    \      Note that the configuration of the span dictates the behavior for\n   \
    \   each individual segment end point in the span.  If a different\n      configuration\
    \ is provisioned for any given segment end point\n      within the span, the new\
    \ configuration for this segment end point\n      will override the span configuration\
    \ for this segment end point\n      only.\n   o  Segment Endpoint Alarm Configuration\
    \ Profiles - These profiles\n      contain parameters for configuring alarm thresholds\
    \ for\n      HDSL2/SHDSL segment endpoints.  These profiles are defined in the\n\
    \      hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfileTable.\n      The index value for this\
    \ profile is a locally-unique\n      administratively assigned name for the profile\
    \ having the textual\n      convention `SnmpAdminString' (RFC 2571 [1]).\n   One\
    \ or more lines may be configured to share parameters of a single\n   profile\
    \ (e.g., hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfile = `silver') by\n   setting its hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfile\
    \ objects to the value\n   of this profile.  If a change is made to the profile,\
    \ all lines that\n   refer to it will be reconfigured to the changed parameters.\
    \  Before a\n   profile can be deleted or taken out of service it must be first\n\

- title: 4.6.  Notifications
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Notifications\n   The ability to generate the SNMP notifications coldStart/WarmStart\n\
    \   (per [21]) which are per agent (e.g., per Digital Subscriber Line\n   Access\
    \ Multiplexer, or DSLAM, in such a device), and linkUp/linkDown\n   (per [21])\
    \ which are per interface (i.e., HDSL2/SHDSL line) is\n   required.\n   A linkDown\
    \ notification MAY be generated whenever any of ES, SES, CRC\n   Anomaly, LOSW,\
    \ or UAS event occurs.  The corresponding linkUp\n   notification MAY be sent\
    \ when all link failure conditions are\n   cleared.\n   The notifications defined\
    \ in this MIB are for initialization failure\n   and for the threshold crossings\
    \ associated with the following events:\n   ES, SES, CRC Anomaly, LOSW, and UAS.\
    \  Each threshold has its own\n   enable/threshold value.  When that value is\
    \ 0, the notification is\n   disabled.\n   The hdsl2ShdslEndpointCurrStatus is\
    \ a bitmask representing all\n   outstanding error conditions associated with\
    \ a particular Segment\n   Endpoint.  Note that since status of remote endpoints\
    \ is obtained via\n   the EOC, this information may be unavailable for units that\
    \ are\n   unreachable via EOC during a line error condition.  Therefore, not\n\
    \   all conditions may always be included in its current status.\n   Notifications\
    \ corresponding to the bit fields in this object are\n   defined.\n   Two alarm\
    \ conditions, SNR Margin Alarm and Loop Attenuation Alarm,\n   are organized in\
    \ a manner slightly different from that implied in the\n   EOC specifications.\
    \  In the MIB, these alarm conditions are tied to\n   the two thresholds hdsl2ShdslEndpointThreshSNRMargin\
    \ and\n   hdsl2ShdslEndpointThreshLoopAttenuation found in the\n   hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfileTable.\
    \  In the EOC, the alarm\n   conditions associated with these thresholds are per-unit.\
    \  In the\n   MIB, these alarm conditions are per-endpoint.  For terminal units,\n\
    \   this has no impact.  For repeaters, this implies an implementation\n   variance\
    \ where the agent in the terminal unit is responsible for\n   detecting a threshold\
    \ crossing.  As the reporting of a repeater\n   detected alarm condition to the\
    \ polling terminal unit occurs in the\n   same EOC message as the reporting of\
    \ the current SNR Margin and Loop\n   Attenuation values, it is anticipated that\
    \ this will have very little\n   impact on agent implementation.\n   A threshold\
    \ notification occurs whenever the corresponding current\n   15-minute interval\
    \ error counter becomes equal to, or exceeds the\n   threshold value.  One notification\
    \ may be sent per interval per\n   interface.  Since the current 15-minute counter\
    \ is reset to 0 every\n   15 minutes, and if the condition persists, the notification\
    \ may recur\n   as  often as every 15 minutes.  For example, to get a notification\n\
    \   whenever a \"loss of\" event occurs (but at most once every 15\n   minutes),\
    \ set the corresponding threshold to 1.  The agent will\n   generate a notification\
    \ when the event originally occurs.\n   Note that the Network Management System,\
    \ or NMS, may receive a\n   linkDown notification, as well, if enabled (via\n\
    \   ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable [21]).  At the beginning of the next 15 minute\n  \
    \ interval, the counter is reset.  When the first second goes by and\n   the event\
    \ occurs, the current interval bucket will be 1, which equals\n   the threshold,\
    \ and the notification will be sent again.\n   A hdsl2ShdslSpanInvalidNumRepeaters\
    \ notification may be generated\n   following completion of the discovery phase\
    \ if the number of\n   repeaters discovered on the line differs from the number\
    \ of repeaters\n   specified in hdsl2ShdslSpanConfNumRepeaters.  For those conditions\n\
    \   where the number of provisioned repeaters is greater than those\n   encountered\
    \ during span discovery, all table entries associated with\n   the nonexistent\
    \ repeaters are to be discarded.  For those conditions\n   where the number of\
    \ provisioned repeaters is less than those\n   encountered during span discovery,\
    \ additional table entries are to be\n   created using the default span configuration\
    \ profile.\n"

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Blocking unauthorized access to the HDSL2-SHDSL\
    \ MIB via the element\n   management system is outside the scope of this document.\
    \  It should\n   be noted that access to the MIB permits the unauthorized entity\
    \ to\n   modify the profiles (section 6.4) such that both subscriber service\n\
    \   and network operations can be interfered with.  Subscriber service\n   can\
    \ be altered by modifying any of a number of service\n   characteristics such\
    \ as rate partitioning and maximum transmission\n   rates.  Network operations\
    \ can be impacted by modification of\n   notification thresholds such as SES thresholds.\n\
    \   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may be\n   considered\
    \ to contain sensitive information.  Access to these objects\n   would allow an\
    \ intruder to obtain information about which vendor's\n   equipment is in use\
    \ on the network.  Further, such information is\n   considered sensitive in many\
    \ environments for competitive reasons.\n   These identifying objects in the inventory\
    \ group are:\n   - hdsl2ShdslInvVendorID\n   - hdsl2ShdslInvVendorModelNumber\n\
    \   - hdsl2ShdslInvVendorSerialNumber\n   - hdsl2ShdslInvVendorEOCSoftwareVersion\n\
    \   - hdsl2ShdslInvStandardVersion\n   - hdsl2ShdslInvVendorListNumber\n   - hdsl2ShdslInvVendorIssueNumber\n\
    \   - hdsl2ShdslInvVendorSoftwareVersion\n   - hdsl2ShdslInvEquipmentCode\n  \
    \ - hdsl2ShdslInvVendorOther\n   - hdsl2ShdslInvTransmissionModeCapability\n \
    \  Therefore, it may be important in some environments to control read\n   access\
    \ to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of\n   these object\
    \ when sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all\n   versions of SNMP provide\
    \ features for such a secure environment.\n   It is recommended that the implementors\
    \ consider the security\n   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically,\
    \ the use\n   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based\n\
    \   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] are recommended.\n   It is then the customer/user's\
    \ responsibility to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity giving access to an instance\
    \ of this MIB, is properly\n   configured to give access to those objects only\
    \ to those principals\n   (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.\n\
    \   HDSL2-SHDSL layer connectivity from the xtuR will permit the\n   subscriber\
    \ to manipulate both the HDSL2-SHDSL link directly and the\n   HDSL2-SHDSL embedded\
    \  operations channel (EOC) for their own loop.\n   For example, unchecked or\
    \ unfiltered fluctuations initiated by the\n   subscriber could generate sufficient\
    \ notifications to potentially\n   overwhelm either the management interface to\
    \ the network or the\n   element manager.\n   It should be noted that interface\
    \ indices in this MIB are maintained\n   persistently.  VACM data relating to\
    \ these should be stored\n   persistently.\n   There are a number of management\
    \ objects defined in this MIB that\n   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write\
    \ and/or read-create.  Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable\
    \ in some network\n   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n\
    \   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network\
    \ operations.\n"
