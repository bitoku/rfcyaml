  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\n\
    \   (DHCP) option which is passed from the DHCP Server to the DHCP Client\n  \
    \ to specify the order in which name services should be consulted when\n   resolving\
    \ hostnames and other information.\n"
- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)[1] provides a\n\
    \   framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP\n   network.\
    \  RFC 2132 [2] allows DHCP servers to specify configuration\n   information for\
    \ various kinds of name services to be passed to DHCP\n   clients.  Many clients\
    \ use multiple name services and have crafted\n   their own conventions that allow\
    \ an individual host to express the\n   order among the various name services\
    \ with which lookups are done.\n   However, no search order can be specified via\
    \ DHCP.  The purpose of\n   this document is to allow DHCP servers to specify\
    \ the search order to\n   be used by DHCP clients.  To avoid the need for inventing\
    \ and\n   maintaining a separate name space for this option, we rely on the\n\
    \   existence of previously-defined DHCP options that specify the IP\n   address(es)\
    \ of servers which provide name services whose order we\n   wish to express.\n"

    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\" and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [3].  This\n   document also uses the following terms:\n      \"DHCP client\"\
    \n         DHCP client or \"client\" is an Internet host using DHCP to\n     \
    \    obtain configuration parameters such as a network address.\n      \"DHCP\
    \ server\"\n         A DHCP server or \"server\" is an Internet host that returns\n\
    \         configuration parameters to DHCP clients.\n   Name Service Search Option\
    \ Format\n     The code for this option is 117, and its minimum length is 2 bytes.\n\
    \     A DHCP server SHOULD return, in its preferred order, the 16-bit,\n     network\
    \ byte order (big-endian [4]) integer option code for the\n     name services\
    \ (the earlier in the list, the more preferred the name\n     service).\n    \

    \     In the above diagram, ns1 and ns2 are 16-bit integers corresponding\n  \
    \   to two DHCP options which specify the IP addresses of two different\n    \
    \ types of name server.  The current list of name services and their\n     DHCP\
    \ option codes, taken from RFC 2132, includes\n       Name Service           \

    \ to indicate that the\n       client should refer to local naming information\
    \ (e.g., an\n       /etc/hosts file on a UNIX machine).\n     A DHCP server wishing\
    \ to express that a client should first search\n     DNS, then NIS+, would send\n\

    \ Client Behavior\n     The DHCP client will use this option to create a search\
    \ list for\n     name resolution.  The client may receive name services in this\n\
    \     option that it does not support or has not been configured to\n     access.\
    \  Likewise, a client may receive an option that lists name\n     services for\
    \ which no corresponding DHCP option was supplied.\n     Clients will interpret\
    \ this option in a system-specific manner\n     whose specification is outside\
    \ the scope of this document.\n"
