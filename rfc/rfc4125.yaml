  - "1.  Introduction\n   [DSTE-REQ] presents the Service Providers requirements for\
    \ support of\n   Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE).  This includes\
    \ the\n   fundamental requirement to be able to enforce different Bandwidth\n\
    \   Constraints for different classes of traffic.\n   [DSTE-REQ] also defines\
    \ the concept of Bandwidth Constraints Model\n   for DS-TE and states that \"\
    The DS-TE technical solution MUST specify\n   at least one Bandwidth Constraints\
    \ Model and MAY specify multiple\n   Bandwidth Constraints Models.\"\n   This\
    \ document provides a detailed description of one particular\n   Bandwidth Constraints\
    \ Model for DS-TE, which is introduced in\n   [DSTE-REQ] and called the Maximum\
    \ Allocation Model (MAM).\n   [DSTE-PROTO] specifies the IGP and RSVP-TE signaling\
    \ extensions for\n   support of DS-TE.  These extensions support MAM.\n"

  - "2.  Definitions\n   For readability, a number of definitions from [DSTE-REQ]\
    \ are repeated\n   here:\n   Class-Type (CT): the set of Traffic Trunks crossing\
    \ a link that is\n                    governed by a specific set of Bandwidth\
    \ Constraints.\n                    CT is used for the purposes of link bandwidth\n\
    \                    allocation, constraint-based routing, and admission\n   \
    \                 control.  A given Traffic Trunk belongs to the same\n      \
    \              CT on all links.\n   TE-Class:        A pair of:\n            \
    \        i. a Class-Type\n                    ii. a preemption priority allowed\
    \ for that Class-\n                    Type.  This means that an LSP transporting\
    \ a Traffic\n                    Trunk from that Class-Type can use that preemption\n\
    \                    priority as the set-up priority, as the holding\n       \
    \             priority or both.\n   A number of recovery mechanisms, under investigation\
    \ or specification\n   in the IETF, take advantage of the concept of bandwidth\
    \ sharing\n   across particular sets of LSPs.  \"Shared Mesh Restoration\" in\n\
    \   [GMPLS-RECOV] and \"Facility-based Computation Model\" in [MPLS-BACKUP]\n\
    \   are example mechanisms that increase bandwidth efficiency by sharing\n   bandwidth\
    \ across backup LSPs protecting against independent failures.\n   To ensure that\
    \ the notion of \"Reserved (CTc)\" introduced in\n   [DSTE-REQ] is compatible\
    \ with such a concept of bandwidth sharing\n   across multiple LSPs, the wording\
    \ of the \"Reserved (CTc)\" definition\n   provided in [DSTE-REQ] is generalized\
    \ into the following:\n   Reserved (CTc): For a given Class-Type CTc ( 0 <= c\
    \ <= MaxCT ), let\n                   us define \"Reserved(CTc)\" as the total\
    \ amount of the\n                   bandwidth reserved by all the established\
    \ LSPs which\n                   belong to CTc.\n   With this generalization,\
    \ the Maximum Allocation Model definition\n   provided in this document is compatible\
    \ with Shared Mesh Restoration\n   defined in [GMPLS-RECOV], so that DS-TE and\
    \ Shared Mesh Protection\n   can operate simultaneously.  This assumes that Shared\
    \ Mesh\n   Restoration operates independently within each DS-TE Class-Type and\n\
    \   does not operate across Class-Types (for example, backup LSPs\n   protecting\
    \ Primary LSPs of CTx also need to belong to CTx; Excess\n   Traffic LSPs sharing\
    \ bandwidth with Backup LSPs of CTx also need to\n   belong to CTx).\n   We also\
    \ introduce the following definition:\n   Reserved(CTb,q): Let us define \"Reserved(CTb,q)\"\
    \ as the total amount\n                    of the bandwidth reserved by all the\
    \ established\n                    LSPs that belong to CTb and have a holding\
    \ priority\n                    of q.  Note that if q and CTb do not form one\
    \ of the\n                    8 possible configured TE-Classes, then there cannot\n\
    \                    be any established LSPs that belongs to CTb and has\n   \
    \                 a holding priority of q; therefore, in this case,\n        \
    \            Reserved(CTb,q) = 0.\n"
- title: 3.  Maximum Allocation Model Definition
  contents:
  - "3.  Maximum Allocation Model Definition\n   MAM is defined in the following manner:\n\
    \        o Maximum Number of Bandwidth Constraints (MaxBC) =\n             Maximum\
    \ Number of Class-Types (MaxCT) = 8\n        o for each value of c in the range\
    \ 0 <= c <= (MaxCT - 1):\n             Reserved (CTc) <= BCc <= Max-Reservable-Bandwidth,\n\
    \        o SUM (Reserved(CTc)) <= Max-Reservable-Bandwidth\n             where\
    \ the SUM is across all values of c in the range\n             0 <= c <= (MaxCT\
    \ - 1)\n   A DS-TE LSR implementing MAM MUST support enforcement of Bandwidth\n\
    \   Constraints in compliance with this definition.\n   To increase the degree\
    \ of bandwidth sharing among the different CTs,\n   the sum of Bandwidth Constraints\
    \ may exceed the Maximum Reservable\n   Bandwidth, so that the following relationship\
    \ may hold true:\n         o SUM (BCc) > Max-Reservable-Bandwidth,\n         \
    \     where the SUM is across all values of c in the range\n              0 <=\
    \ c <= (MaxCT - 1)\n   The sum of Bandwidth Constraints may also be equal to (or\
    \ below) the\n   Maximum Reservable Bandwidth.  In that case, the Maximum Reservable\n\
    \   Bandwidth does not actually constrain CT bandwidth reservations (in\n   other\
    \ words, the 3rd bullet item of the MAM definition above will\n   never effectively\
    \ come into play).  This is because the 2nd bullet\n   item of the MAM definition\
    \ above implies that:\n       SUM (reserved(CTc)) <= SUM (BCc)\n   and we assume\
    \ here that\n       SUM (BCc) <= Maximum Reservable Bandwidth.\n   Therefore,\
    \ it will always be true that:\n       SUM (Reserved(CTc)) <= Max-Reservable-Bandwidth.\n\
    \   Both preemption within a CT and across CTs is allowed.\n   Where 8 CTs are\
    \ active, the MAM Bandwidth Constraints can also be\n   expressed in the following\
    \ way:\n      - All LSPs from CT7 use no more than BC7\n      - All LSPs from\
    \ CT6 use no more than BC6\n      - All LSPs from CT5 use no more than BC5\n \
    \     - etc.\n      - All LSPs from CT0 use no more than BC0\n      - All LSPs\
    \ from all CTs collectively use no more than the Maximum\n        Reservable Bandwidth\n\
    \   Purely for illustration purposes, the diagram below represents MAM in\n  \
    \ a pictorial manner when 3 CTs are active:\n        I----------------------------I\n\

    \        <--Max Reservable Bandwidth-->\n   (Note that, in this illustration,\
    \ the sum BC0 + BC1 + BC2 exceeds the\n   Max Reservable Bandwidth.)\n   While\
    \ more flexible/sophisticated Bandwidth Constraints Models can be\n   defined\
    \ (and are indeed defined; see [DSTE-RDM]), the Maximum\n   Allocation Model is\
    \ attractive in some DS-TE environments for the\n   following reasons:\n     \
    \ - Network administrators generally find MAM simple and intuitive\n      - MAM\
    \ matches simple bandwidth control policies that Network\n        Administrators\
    \ may want to enforce, such as setting an\n        individual Bandwidth Constraint\
    \ for a given type of traffic\n        (a.k.a. Class-Type) and simultaneously\
    \ limit the aggregate of\n        reserved bandwidth across all types of traffic.\n\
    \      - MAM can be used in a way which ensures isolation across Class-\n    \
    \    Types, whether preemption is used or not.\n      - MAM can simultaneously\
    \ achieve isolation, bandwidth efficiency,\n        and protection against QoS\
    \ degradation of the premium CT.\n      - MAM only requires limited protocol extensions\
    \ such as the ones\n        defined in [DSTE-PROTO].\n   MAM may not be attractive\
    \ in some DS-TE environments because:\n      - MAM cannot simultaneously achieve\
    \ isolation, bandwidth\n        efficiency, and protection against QoS degradation\
    \ of CTs other\n        than the Premium CT.\n   Additional considerations on\
    \ the properties of MAM, and its\n   comparison with RDM, can be found in [BC-CONS]\
    \ and [BC-MODEL].\n   As a very simple example of usage of MAM, a network administrator\n\
    \   using one CT for Voice (CT1) and one CT for Data (CT0) might\n   configure\
    \ on a given 2.5 Gb/s link:\n      - BC0 = 2 Gb/s (i.e., Data is limited to 2\
    \ Gb/s)\n      - BC1 = 1 Gb/s (i.e., Voice is limited to 1 Gb/s)\n      - Maximum\
    \ Reservable Bandwidth = 2.5 Gb/s (i.e., aggregate Data +\n        Voice is limited\
    \ to 2.5 Gb/s)\n"
