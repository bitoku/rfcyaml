  contents:
  - "1.1.  Burst/Gap Loss Metrics Block\n   This document defines a new block type\
    \ to augment those defined in\n   [RFC3611] for use in a range of RTP applications.\
    \  The new block type\n   supports the reporting of the proportion of packets\
    \ lost by the\n   network.  The losses during loss bursts are reported, together\
    \ with\n   the number of bursts and additional data, allowing the calculation\
    \ of\n   statistical parameters (mean and variance) of the distribution of\n \
    \  burst lengths.  Some uses of these metrics depend on the availability\n   of\
    \ the metric \"cumulative number of packets lost\" from RTCP\n   [RFC3550].\n\
    \   This block provides information on transient IP problems.  Burst/gap\n   metrics\
    \ are typically used in Cumulative reports; however, they also\n   may be used\
    \ in Interval reports.  The burstiness of packet loss\n   affects user experience,\
    \ may influence any sender strategies to\n   mitigate the problem, and may also\
    \ have diagnostic value.\n   The metric belongs to the class of transport-related\
    \ end system\n   metrics defined in [RFC6792].\n   The definitions of \"burst\"\
    , \"gap\", \"loss\", and \"discard\" are\n   consistent with definitions in [RFC3611].\
    \  To accommodate the range\n   of jitter buffer algorithms and packet discard\
    \ logic that may be used\n   by implementors, the method used to distinguish between\
    \ bursts and\n   gaps may be an equivalent method to that defined in [RFC3611].\
    \  The\n   method used should produce the same result as that defined in\n   [RFC3611]\
    \ for conditions of burst packet loss but may produce\n   different results for\
    \ conditions of time-varying jitter.\n"
- title: 1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports
  contents:
  - "1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports\n   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in\
    \ [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]\n   defines an extensible structure for reporting by using\
    \ an RTCP\n   Extended Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report\n\
    \   block for use with [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].\n"
- title: 1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework\n   The Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390]\
    \ provides guidance on the\n   definition and specification of performance metrics.\
    \  The \"Guidelines\n   for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework\" [RFC6792] provides\n\
    \   guidelines for reporting block format using RTCP XR.  The Metrics\n   Block\
    \ described in this document is in accordance with the guidelines\n   in [RFC6390]\
    \ and [RFC6792].\n"
- title: 1.4.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "1.4.  Applicability\n   These metrics are applicable to a range of RTP applications\
    \ that\n   contain jitter buffers and don't use stream repair means, e.g.,\n \
    \  Forward Error Correction (FEC) [RFC5109] and/or retransmission\n   [RFC4588].\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [RFC2119].\n   In addition, the following terms are defined:\n   Received,\
    \ Lost, and Discarded\n      A packet shall be regarded as lost if it fails to\
    \ arrive within an\n      implementation-specific time window.  A packet that\
    \ arrives within\n      this time window but is too early or late to be played\
    \ out or\n      thrown away before playout due to packet duplication or redundancy\n\
    \      shall be regarded as discarded.  A packet shall be classified as\n    \
    \  one of received (or OK), discarded, or lost.  The metric\n      \"cumulative\
    \ number of packets lost\" defined in [RFC3550] reports a\n      count of packets\
    \ lost from the media stream (single\n      Synchronization Source (SSRC) within\
    \ a single RTP session).\n      Similarly, the metric \"number of packets discarded\"\
    \ defined in\n      [DISCARD] reports a count of packets discarded from the media\n\
    \      stream (single SSRC within single RTP session) arriving at the\n      receiver.\
    \  The post-repair Loss RLE metric, which is defined in\n      [RFC5725], can\
    \ be used to report the number of packets that are\n      not recovered by any\
    \ repair techniques that are in use.\n   Bursts and Gaps\n      The terms \"burst\"\
    \ and \"gap\" are used in a manner consistent with\n      that of RTCP XR [RFC3611].\
    \  RTCP XR views an RTP stream as being\n      divided into bursts, which are\
    \ periods when the loss rate is high\n      enough to cause noticeable quality\
    \ degradation (generally over 5\n      percent loss rate) and gaps, which are\
    \ periods when lost packets\n      are infrequent and hence quality is generally\
    \ acceptable.\n"
- title: 3.  Burst/Gap Loss Metrics Block
  contents:
  - "3.  Burst/Gap Loss Metrics Block\n   Metrics in this block report on burst/gap\
    \ loss in the stream arriving\n   at the RTP system.  The measurement of these\
    \ metrics is made at the\n   receiving end of the RTP stream.  Each instance of\
    \ this Metrics Block\n   refers by SSRC to a separate auxiliary Measurement Information\
    \ Block\n   [RFC6776], which describes the measurement periods in use (see RFC\n\
    \   6776, Section 4.2).\n   This Metrics Block relies on the measurement period\
    \ in the\n   Measurement Information Block indicating the span of the report.\n\
    \   Senders MUST send this block in the same compound RTCP packet as the\n   Measurement\
    \ Information Block.  Receivers MUST verify that the\n   measurement period is\
    \ received in the same compound RTCP packet as\n   this Metrics Block.  If not,\
    \ this Metrics Block MUST be discarded.\n"

    \ 8 bits\n      A Burst/Gap Loss Metrics Block is identified by the constant 20.\n\
    \   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bits\n      This field is used to indicate whether\

    \         I=01: Sampled Value - the reported value is a sampled\n         instantaneous\
    \ value.\n      In this document, burst/gap loss metrics can only be measured\
    \ over\n      definite intervals and cannot be sampled.  Also, the value I=00\
    \ is\n      reserved for future use.  Senders MUST NOT use the values I=00 or\n\

    \    discard the block.\n    Loss and Discard Combination flag (C): 1 bit\n  \
    \    The 'C' flag is used to indicate whether the loss/discard report\n      is\
    \ combined with the burst/gap loss report in the same compound\n      RTCP packet.\
    \  The value is set to '1' if the loss/discard report\n      and the burst gap\
    \ loss report are combined.  Otherwise, the value\n      is set to '0'.  If the\

    \ MUST discard the burst/gap\n      loss.\n   Reserved (resv.): 5 bits\n     \

    \ the\n      value 0xFFFFFF MUST be reported.\n   Total Packets Expected in Bursts:\
    \ 24 bits\n      The total number of packets expected during loss bursts (that\
    \ is,\n      the sum of received packets and lost packets).\n      The measured\
    \ value is an unsigned value.  If the measured value\n      exceeds 0xFFFFFD,\

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This block does not provide per-packet statistics,\
    \ so the risk to\n   confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of [RFC3611]\n\
    \   does not apply.  However, the gaps indicated within this block could\n   be\
    \ used to detect the timing of other events on the path between the\n   sender\
    \ and receiver.  For example, a competing multimedia stream\n   might cause a\
    \ loss burst for the duration of the stream, allowing the\n   receiver of this\
    \ block to know when the competing stream was active.\n   This risk is not a significant\
    \ threat since the only information\n   leaked is the timing of the loss, not\
    \ the cause.  Besides this, it is\n   believed that this proposed RTCP XR report\
    \ block introduces no other\n   new security considerations beyond those described\
    \ in [RFC3611].\n"
