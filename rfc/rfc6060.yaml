  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IEEE 802.1 Provider Backbone Bridge Traffic Engineering\
    \ (PBB-TE)\n   [IEEE802.1Qay] standard supports the establishment of explicitly\n\
    \   routed traffic engineered paths within Provider Backbone Bridged\n   (PBB)\
    \ networks.  PBB-TE allows the disabling of:\n      - the Spanning Tree Protocol\n\
    \      - unknown destination address forwarding\n      - source address learning\n\
    \   for administratively selected VLAN Identifiers.  With PBB-TE an\n   external\
    \ provisioning system or control plane can be used to\n   configure static entries\
    \ in the managed objects of bridges and so\n   establish traffic engineered paths\
    \ in the network.\n   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) [RFC3945] is a family of control\
    \ plane\n   protocols designed to operate in connection oriented and traffic\n\
    \   engineering transport networks.  GMPLS is applicable to a range of\n   network\
    \ technologies including L2SC networks (Layer 2 Switching\n   Capable).  The purpose\
    \ of this document is to specify extensions for\n   a GMPLS-based control plane\
    \ to manage PBB-TE explicitly routed\n   traffic engineered paths.  This specification\
    \ is complementary to the\n   GMPLS Ethernet Label Switching Architecture and\
    \ Framework document\n   [RFC5828].\n"

- title: 2.1.  PBB-TE and GMPLS Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.1.  PBB-TE and GMPLS Terminology\n   The PBB-TE specification [IEEE802.1Qay]\
    \ defines some additional\n   terminology to clarify the PBB-TE functions.  We\
    \ repeat these here in\n   expanded context to translate from IEEE to GMPLS terminology.\
    \  The\n   terms \"bridge\" and \"switch\" are used interchangeably in this\n\
    \   document.  The signaling extensions described here apply equally well\n  \
    \ to a PBB-TE-capable bridge supporting GMPLS signaling or to a GMPLS-\n   capable\
    \ switch supporting Ethernet PBB-TE forwarding.\n      - Ethernet Switched Path\
    \ (ESP):\n        A provisioned traffic engineered unidirectional connectivity\n\
    \        path between two or more Customer Backbone Ports (CBPs) that\n      \
    \  extends over a Provider Backbone Bridge Network (PBBN).  The\n        path\
    \ is identified by the 3-tuple <ESP-MAC DA, ESP-MAC SA, ESP-\n        VID>.  An\
    \ ESP is point-to-point (P2P) or point-to-multipoint\n        (P2MP).  An ESP\
    \ is analogous to a (unidirectional) point-to-\n        point or point-to-multipoint\
    \ LSP.  We use the term Ethernet-LSP\n        (Eth-LSP) for GMPLS established\
    \ ESPs.\n      - Point-to-Point ESP:\n        An ESP between two CBPs.  The ESP-DA\
    \ and the ESP-SA in the ESP's\n        3-tuple identifier are the individual MAC\
    \ addresses of the two\n        CBPs.\n      - Point-to-Multipoint ESP:\n    \
    \    An ESP among one root CBP and n leaf CBPs.  The ESP-DA in the\n        ESP's\
    \ 3-tuple identifier is a group MAC address identifying the\n        n leaf CBPs,\
    \ and the ESP-SA is the individual MAC address of the\n        root.\n      -\
    \ Point-to-Point PBB-TE Service Instance (P2P TESI):\n        A service instance\
    \ supported by two point-to-point ESPs where\n        the ESPs' endpoints have\
    \ the same CBP MAC addresses.  The two\n        unidirectional ESPs are forming\
    \ a bidirectional service.  The\n        PBB-TE standard [IEEE802.1Qay] notes\
    \ the following: for reasons\n        relating to TE service monitoring diagnostics,\
    \ operational\n        simplicity, etc., the IEEE PBB-TE standard assumes that\
    \ the\n        point-to-point ESPs associated with a point-to-point TESI are\n\
    \        co-routed.  Support for a point-to-point TE services that\n        comprises\
    \ non-co-routed ESPs is problematic, and is not defined\n        in this standard.\
    \  Hence, a GMPLS bidirectional LSP is analogous\n        to a P2P TE Service\
    \ Instance.  We use the term \"bidirectional\n        Ethernet-LSP\" for GMPLS-established\
    \ P2P PBB-TE Service\n        Instances.\n"

- title: 3.  Creation and Maintenance of PBB-TE Paths Using GMPLS
  contents:
  - "3.  Creation and Maintenance of PBB-TE Paths Using GMPLS\n   IEEE PBB-TE is a\
    \ connection-oriented Ethernet technology.  PBB-TE\n   ESPs are created bridge\
    \ by bridge (or switch by switch) by simple\n   configuration of Ethernet forwarding\
    \ entries.  This document\n   describes the use of GMPLS as a valid control plane\
    \ for the setup,\n   teardown, protection, and recovery of ESPs and TESIs and\
    \ specifies\n   the required RSVP-TE extensions for the control of PBB-TE Service\n\
    \   Instances.\n   PBB-TE ESP and services are always originated and terminated\
    \ on\n   IB-Backbone Edge Bridges (IB-BEBs).  IB-BEBs are constituted of I and\n\
    \   B components, this is illustrated in Figure 1.  A B-component refers\n   to\
    \ the structure and mechanisms that support the relaying of frames\n   identified\
    \ by Backbone VLANs in a Provider Backbone Bridge.  An\n   I-component refers\
    \ to the structure and mechanisms that support the\n   relaying of frames identified\
    \ by service instances (I-SIDs) in a\n   Provider Backbone Bridge.  PBB and PBB-TE\
    \ relay frames with added\n   I-Component TAGs in the I-component and VLAN TAGs\
    \ in the B-component.\n   PBB and PBB-TE forward frames based on VLAN ID in the\
    \ VLAN TAG (in\n   the PBB case a B-VID) until the destination MAC address is\
    \ supported\n   locally by a B-component on this bridge indicating the destination\n\
    \   has been reached.  At that point, the B-VLAN tag is removed and\n   processing\
    \ or forwarding on the next TAG begins (in the PBB case an\n   I-Component TAG)\
    \ until the I-component identified by the I-SID is\n   reached.  At the I-component,\
    \ the I-Component TAG is removed and the\n   next Ethernet type identifies the\
    \ TAG, etc.\n   An Ethernet service supported by a PBB-TE TESI is always attached\
    \ to\n   a Customer Network Port (CNP) of the I-component.  A Service Instance\n\
    \   Identifier (I-SID) is assigned for the service.  I-SIDs are only\n   looked\
    \ at by source and destination (edge) bridges, so I-SIDs are\n   transparent to\
    \ path operations and MAY be signaled.  The I- and\n   B-components have internal\
    \ ports that are connected via an internal\n   LAN.  These internal ports are\
    \ the Provider Instance Ports (PIPs) and\n   Customer Backbone Ports (CBPs). \
    \ PIPs and CBPs are not visible\n   outside the IB-BEB.  ESPs are always originated\
    \ and terminated on CBP\n   ports and use the MAC address of that port.  The I-component\n\
    \   encapsulates the service frames arriving from the CNP by adding an\n   I-SID\
    \ and a complete Ethernet MAC header with an ESP-MAC DA and\n   ESP-MAC SA.  The\
    \ B-component adds the ESP-VID.\n   This document defines extensions to GMPLS\
    \ to establish ESPs and\n   TESIs.  As can be seen from the above, this requires\
    \ configuration of\n   both the I- and B-components of the IB-BEBs connected by\
    \ the ESPs.\n   In the GMPLS control plane, TE Router IDs are used to identify\
    \ the\n   IB-BEBs and Backbone Core Bridges (BCBs), and TE Links describe links\n\
    \   connected to PNPs and CNPs.  TE Links are not associated with CBPs or\n  \
    \ PIPs.\n   Note that since multiple internal CBPs may exist, an IB-BEB receiving\n\
    \   a PATH message MUST be able to determine the appropriate CBP that is\n   the\
    \ termination point of the Eth-LSP.  To this end, IB-BEBs SHOULD\n   advertise\
    \ the CNP TE Links in the GMPLS control plane and RSVP-TE\n   signaling SHOULD\
    \ use the CNP TE Links to identify the termination\n   point of Eth-LSPs.  An\
    \ IB-BEB receiving a PATH message specifying one\n   of its CNPs can locally determine\
    \ which CBPs have internal\n   connectivity to the I-component supporting the\
    \ given CNP.  In the\n   case that there is more than one suitable CBP, and no\
    \ I-SID\n   information is provided in the PATH message or previously in the\n\
    \   associated Call setup, then the IB-BEB can decide freely which CBP to\n  \
    \ assign to the requested connection.  On the other hand, if there is\n   information\
    \ on the service (I-SID) that the given ESP will support,\n   then the IB-BEB\
    \ MUST first determine which PIP and associated CBP is\n   configured with the\
    \ I-SID and MUST assign that CBP to the ESP.\n                      Backbone Edge\

    \ Space\n   PBB-TE defines the tuple of <ESP-MAC DA, ESP-MAC SA, ESP-VID> as a\n\
    \   unique connection identifier in the data plane, but the forwarding\n   operation\
    \ only uses the ESP-MAC DA and the ESP-VID in each direction.\n   The ESP-VID\
    \ typically comes from a small number of VIDs dedicated to\n   PBB-TE.  ESP-VIDs\
    \ can be reused across ESPs.  There is no requirement\n   that ESP-VIDs for two\
    \ ESPs that form a P2P TESI be the same.\n   When configuring an ESP with GMPLS,\
    \ the ESP-MAC DA and ESP-VID are\n   carried in a generalized label object and\
    \ are assigned hop by hop,\n   but are invariant within a domain.  This invariance\
    \ is similar to\n   GMPLS operation in transparent optical networks.  As is typical\
    \ with\n   other technologies controlled by GMPLS, the data plane receiver MUST\n\
    \   accept, and usually assigns, labels from its available label pool.\n   This,\
    \ together with the label invariance requirement mentioned above,\n   result in\
    \ each PBB-TE Ethernet Label being a domain-wide unique\n   label, with a unique\

- title: 3.1.  Shared Forwarding
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Shared Forwarding\n   One capability of a connectionless Ethernet data\
    \ plane is to reuse\n   destination forwarding entries for packets from any source\
    \ within a\n   VLAN to a destination.  When setting up P2P PBB-TE connections\
    \ for\n   multiple sources sharing a common destination, this capability MAY be\n\
    \   preserved provided certain requirements are met.  We refer to this\n   capability\
    \ as \"shared forwarding\".  Shared forwarding is invoked\n   based on policy\
    \ when conditions are met.  It is a local decision by\n   label allocation at\
    \ each end plus the path constraints.  Shared\n   forwarding has no impact on\
    \ the actual paths that are set up, but it\n   allows the reduction of forwarding\
    \ entries.  Shared forwarding paths\n   are identical in function to independently\
    \ routed paths that share a\n   path from an intersecting bridge or link except\
    \ they share a single\n   forwarding entry.\n   The forwarding memory savings\
    \ from shared forwarding can be quite\n   dramatic in some topologies where a\
    \ high degree of meshing is\n   required; however, it is typically easier to achieve\
    \ when the\n   connectivity is known in advance.  Normally, the originating GMPLS\n\
    \   switch will not have knowledge of the set of shared forwarding paths\n   rooted\
    \ on the source or destination switch.\n   Use of a Path Computation Element [RFC4655]\
    \ or other planning style\n   of tool with more complete knowledge of the network\
    \ configuration is\n   a way to impose pre-selection of shared forwarding with\
    \ multiple\n   paths using a single forwarding entry and optimizing for both\n\
    \   directions.  In this scenario, the originating bridge uses the\n   LABEL_SET\
    \ and UPSTREAM_LABEL objects to indicate the selection of the\n   shared forwarding\
    \ labels at both ends.\n"
- title: 3.2.  P2P Connections Procedures for Shared Forwarding
  contents:
  - "3.2.  P2P Connections Procedures for Shared Forwarding\n   The ESP-VID/ESP-MAC\
    \ DA can be considered to be a shared forwarding\n   identifier or label consisting\
    \ of some number of P2P connections\n   distinctly identified by the <ESP-MAC\
    \ DA, ESP-MAC SA, ESP-VID> tuple.\n   This is analogous to an LDP label merge,\
    \ but in the shared forwarding\n   case, the ESP header contains sufficient information\
    \ to identify the\n   flow to which a packet belongs.  Resources can continue\
    \ to be\n   allocated per LSP with shared forwarding.\n   VLAN-tagged Ethernet\
    \ packets include priority marking.  Priority bits\n   MAY be used to indicate\
    \ Class of Service (COS) and drop priority.\n   Thus, traffic from multiple COSs\
    \ could be multiplexed on the same\n   Eth-LSP (i.e., similar to E-LSPs) and queuing\
    \ and drop decisions are\n   made based on the p-bits.  This means that the queue\
    \ selection can be\n   done based on a per-flow basis (i.e., Eth-LSP + priority)\
    \ and is\n   decoupled from the actual steering of the packet at any given bridge.\n\
    \   A bridge terminating an Eth-LSP will frequently have more than one\n   suitable\
    \ candidate for sharing a forwarding entry (common\n   ESP-VID/ESP-MAC DA, unique\
    \ ESP-MAC SA).  It is a local decision of\n   how this is performed but a good\
    \ choice is a path that reduces the\n   requirement for new forwarding entries\
    \ by reusing common existing\n   paths.\n   The concept of bandwidth management\
    \ still applies equally well with\n   shared forwarding.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  P2P Ethernet LSPs\n   PBB-TE is designed to be bidirectional and symmetrically\
    \ routed just\n   like Ethernet.  That is, complete and proper functionality of\n\
    \   Ethernet protocols is only guaranteed for bidirectional Eth-LSPs.  In\n  \
    \ this section, we discuss the establishment of bidirectional Eth-LSPs.\n   Note,\
    \ however, that it is also possible to use RSVP-TE to configure\n   unidirectional\
    \ ESPs, if the UPSTREAM_LABEL is not included in the\n   PATH message.\n   To\
    \ initiate a bidirectional Eth-LSP, the initiator of the PATH\n   message MUST\
    \ use the procedures outlined in [RFC3473] with the\n   following specifics:\n\
    \      1) it MUST set the LSP encoding type to Ethernet (2) [RFC3471].\n     \
    \ 2) it MUST set the LSP switching type to \"802_1 PBB-TE\", value 40.\n     \
    \ 3) it SHOULD set the Generalized Payload Identifier (G-PID) to\n         Ethernet\
    \ (33) [RFC3471].\n      4) it MUST set the UPSTREAM_LABEL to the ESP-VID1/ESP-MAC1\
    \ tuple\n         where the ESP-VID1 is administered locally for the local MAC\n\
    \         address: MAC1.\n      5) it SHOULD set the LABEL_SET or SUGGESTED_LABEL\
    \ if it chooses to\n         influence the choice of ESP-VID/ESP-MAC DA.\n   \
    \   6) it MAY carry an I-SID via Call/Connection ID [RFC4974].\n   Intermediate\
    \ and egress bridge processing is not modified by this\n   document, i.e., is\
    \ per [RFC3473].  However, as previously stated,\n   intermediate bridges supporting\
    \ the 802_1 PBB-TE switching type MUST\n   NOT modify LABEL values.\n   The ESP-VID1/ESP-MAC1\
    \ tuple contained in the UPSTREAM_LABEL is used\n   to create a static forwarding\
    \ entry in the Filtering Database of\n   bridges at each hop for the upstream\
    \ direction.  This behavior is\n   inferred from the switching type, which is\
    \ 802_1 PBB-TE.  The port\n   derived from the RSVP_HOP object and the ESP-VID1\
    \ and ESP-MAC1\n   included in the PBB-TE Ethernet Label constitute the static\
    \ entry.\n   At the destination, an ESP-VID (ESP-VID2) is allocated for the local\n\
    \   MAC address: MAC2, the ESP-VID2/ESP-MAC2 tuple is passed in the LABEL\n  \
    \ object in the RESV message.  As with the PATH message, intermediate\n   bridge\
    \ processing is per [RFC3473], and the LABEL object MUST be\n   passed on unchanged,\
    \ upstream.  The ESP-VID2/ESP-MAC2 tuple contained\n   in the LABEL object is\
    \ installed in the forwarding table as a static\n   forwarding entry at each hop.\
    \  This creates a bidirectional Eth-LSP\n   as the PATH and RESV messages follow\

  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not introduce new security\
    \ issues; the\n   considerations in [RFC4872] and [RFC4873] apply.\n   A GMPLS-controlled\
    \ Ethernet PBB-TE system assumes that users and\n   devices attached to User-to-Network\
    \ Interfaces (UNIs) may behave\n   maliciously, negligently, or incorrectly. \
    \ Intra-provider control\n   traffic is trusted not to be malicious.  In general,\
    \ these\n   requirements are no different from the security requirements for\n\
    \   operating any GMPLS network.  Access to the trusted network will only\n  \
    \ occur through the protocols defined for the UNI or Network-to-Network\n   Interface\
    \ (NNI) or through protected management interfaces.\n   When in-band GMPLS signaling\
    \ is used for the control plane, the\n   security of the control plane and the\
    \ data plane may affect each\n   other.  When out-of-band GMPLS signaling is used\
    \ for the control\n   plane, the data-plane security is decoupled from the control\
    \ plane;\n   therefore, the security of the data plane has less impact on overall\n\
    \   security.\n   Where GMPLS is applied to the control of VLAN only, the commonly\n\
    \   known techniques for mitigation of Ethernet denial-of-service (DoS)\n   attacks\
    \ may be required on UNI ports.  PBB-TE has been designed to\n   interwork with\
    \ legacy VLANs and the VLANs provide isolation from\n   Ethernet legacy control\
    \ planes.\n   Where control-plane communications are point-to-point over links\
    \ that\n   employ 802.1AE Media Access Control Security [MACSEC], it may\n   reasonably\
    \ be determined that no further security measures are used.\n   In other cases,\
    \ it is appropriate to use control-plane security where\n   it is deemed necessary\
