  title: Status of this Memo
- contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This work is the result of the IETF Integrated Directory Services\n
    \  (IDS) Working Group.  The IDS Working Group proposes a standard\n   specification
    for a simple Internet White Pages service by defining a\n   common schema for
    use by the various White Pages servers.  This\n   schema is independent of specific
    implementations of the White Pages\n   service.\n   This document specifies the
    minimum set of core attributes of a White\n   Pages entry for an individual and
    describes how new objects with\n   those attributes can be defined and published.
    \ It does not describe\n   how to represent other objects in the White Pages service.
    \ Further,\n   it does not address the search sort expectations within a particular\n
    \  service.\n"

  - "1.0     Introduction to IWPS\n   The Internet community has stated a need for
    the development and\n   deployment of a White Pages service for use in locating
    information\n   about people in the Internet [PA94].  To facilitate interoperability\n
    \  and to provide a common user experience, the Internet White Pages\n   Service
    (IWPS) must have a common set of information about each\n   person.\n   A common
    user object would allow a user to go between implementations\n   of the service
    and to expect consistency in the types of information\n   provided.  A common
    user object would also provide developers with an\n   unambigious method of representing
    the information managed by the\n   service.\n   This document will focus only
    on common information modeling issues\n   to which all IWPS providers must conform.\n"

    - "2.0     Scope\n   This document establishes the set of attributes that specify
      the\n   Common User Information Object for the IWPS.  It does not attempt to\n
      \  be an exhaustive specification of all objects that may be stored in\n   the
      IWPS. The process used by this document to define the user object\n   is recommended
      to be used to define other information objects used in\n   the IWPS.\n   All
      conforming implementations must support at the minimum, the core\n   attributes
      listed in Section 5.0. Implementations may include local\n   attributes in addition
      to the core set and still be considered \"in\n   conformance\".\n   This document
      will not specify rules with respect to information\n   privacy.  Each country
      has its own set of laws and practices.\n   Previous work covering this area
      has been done by the North American\n   Directory Forum (NADF), whose publication
      [NADF92] contain\n   recommendations for registrants' rights in both the USA
      and Canada.\n   This document does not specify a Directory access protocol (i.e.\n
      \  whois++, LDAP, DAP, etc.).\n"
    title: 2.0     Scope
  - contents:
    - "3.0     IWPS Schema Considerations\n   The description of the IWPS information
      object consists of the\n   following requirements:\n              1. Syntax
      for definition/representation of information\n                 object templates.\n
      \             2. Publication of information object templates, etc.\n              3.
      Database structure or schema.\n   Items 1 and 2 will be covered in this document.
      \ Because database\n   structure can potentially restrict implementations (i.e.
      X.500 schema\n   based versus DNS schema based) it will be treated as a separate\n
      \  research topic and will not be defined in this paper.\n"

  - contents:
    - "4.0     Syntax for Definition/Representation of Information Object\n        Templates\n
      \  A clear, precise, and consistent method must be used when discussing\n   information
      object templates and their associated attributes.\n   Therefore, this document
      makes uses of the previously defined syntax\n   used by LDAP.  To avoid restrictions
      on implementations of the IWPS,\n   some syntax are listed as requirements vs
      specific encodings.  The\n   general IWPS syntax is included in section 6.0
      for reference.\n   The IWPS Person Object specifies a limited set of recommended\n
      \  attributes that a White Pages Service must include.  Storage of user\n   attributes
      are a local issue, therefore, this memo suggests storage\n   sizes but not storage
      types.\n   This document lists the syntax with the attributes for developers
      of\n   user interface (UIs) to use as a reference, but it does not specify\n
      \  how the UI should display these attributes.\n   Attributes that contain multiple-line
      text (i.e. Address) must use\n   the procedure defined in RFC 822 in section
      3.1.1 on \"folding\" long\n   header lines [RFC-822].\n"
    title: 4.0     Syntax for Definition/Representation of Information Object
  - contents:
    - "5.0     Information Object Template Definitions\n   This section describes
      the IWPS Person Information Object Template\n   and its associated attributes.
      \ The Person Object is a simple list of\n   attributes, no structure nor object
      inheritance is implied.\n   IWPS client applications should use the following
      size\n   recommendations as the maximum sizes of the attributes.  However,\n
      \  applications should be able to handle attributes of arbitrary size,\n   returned
      by a server which may not comply with these recommendation.\n   All size recommendations
      are in characters.\n   Note: Because many characters in many encodings require
      more than one\n   byte, the size recommendations cannot be interpreted as sizes
      in\n   bytes.\n   This set of attributes describes information types, and are
      not\n   defined attributes in a particular schema.  Any technology deploying\n
      \  a White Page service (WHOIS ++, LDAP, vCard, etc.) will need to\n   publish
      as a companion document, their specific schema detailing how\n   the general
      attributes of the White Pages schema are expressed.\n   SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n

    - "6.0     IWPS Person Information Object Template Syntax\n   This section defines
      the syntax used by the IWPS person information\n   object template.  It is copied
      in whole from the LDAP attribute\n   working document with some modification
      for completeness.\n   Certificate:\n      The certificate field is intended
      to hold any kind of certificate;\n      X.509 certificates are one example.
      A specific implementation will\n      specify how to indicate the type of certificate
      when describing\n      the mapping of the IWPS schema onto the implementation
      schema.\n   WhitepageString:\n      This syntax must be able to encode arbitrary
      ISO 10646 characters.\n      One such encoding is the UTF-8 encoding [UTF-8].\n
      \  GeneralizedTime:\n      Values of this syntax are encoded as printable strings,\n
      \     represented as specified in X.208.  Note that the time zone must\n      be
      specified.  It is strongly recommended that Zulu time zone be\n      used.  For

      are many kinds of mailbox addresses, including X.400 and\n      Internet mailbox
      addresses. The implementation must clearly\n      distinguish between different
      types of mailbox address, for\n      instance by using a textual refix or a
      set of attribute types.\n      There must be a way to represent any mailbox
      type.\n   Address:\n      According to Universal Postal Union standards, this
      field must be\n      able to represent at least 6 lines of 40 characters.\n
      \  PrintableString:\n      The encoding of a value with PrintableString syntax
