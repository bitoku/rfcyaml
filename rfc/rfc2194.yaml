- title: 3.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "3.  Introduction\n   Considerable interest has arisen recently in a set of features\
    \ that\n   fit within the general category of \"roaming capability\" for Internet\n\
    \   users.  Interested parties have included:\n      Regional Internet Service\
    \ Providers (ISPs) operating within a\n      particular state or province, looking\
    \ to combine their efforts\n      with those of other regional providers to offer\
    \ service over a\n      wider area.\n      National ISPs wishing to combine their\
    \ operations with those of\n      one or more ISPs in another nation to offer\
    \ more comprehensive\n      service in a group of countries or on a continent.\n\
    \      Businesses desiring to offer their employees a comprehensive\n      package\
    \ of access services on a global basis.  Those services may\n      include Internet\
    \ access as well as secure access to corporate\n      intranets via a Virtual\
    \ Private Network (VPN), enabled by\n      tunneling protocols such as PPTP, L2F,\
    \ or L2TP.\n   What is required to provide roaming capability?  The following\
    \ list\n   is a first cut at defining the requirements for successful roaming\n\
    \   among an arbitrary set of ISPs:\n      Phone number presentation\n      Phone\
    \ number exchange\n      Phone book compilation\n      Phone book update\n   \
    \   Connection management\n      Authentication\n      NAS Configuration/Authorization\n\
    \      Address assignment and routing\n      Security\n      Accounting\n   In\
    \ this document we review existing roaming implementations,\n   describing their\
    \ functionality within this framework.  In addition to\n   full fledged roaming\
    \ implementations, we will also review\n   implementations that, while not meeting\
    \ the strict definition of\n   roaming, address several of these problem elements.\
    \ These\n   implementations typically fall into the category of shared use\n \
    \  networks or non-IP dialup networks.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Terminology\n   This document frequently uses the following terms:\n  \
    \ home ISP  This is the Internet service provider with whom the user\n       \
    \   maintains an account relationship.\n   local ISP This is the Internet service\
    \ provider whom the user calls\n          in order to get access. Where roaming\
    \ is implemented the local\n          ISP may be different from the home ISP.\n\
    \   phone book\n          This is a database or document containing data pertaining\
    \ to\n          dialup access, including phone numbers and any associated\n  \
    \        attributes.\n   shared use network\n          This is an IP dialup network\
    \ whose use is shared by two or\n          more organizations.  Shared use networks\
    \ typically implement\n          distributed authentication and accounting in\
    \ order to\n          facilitate the relationship among the sharing parties. Since\n\
    \          these facilities are also required for implementation of\n        \
    \  roaming, implementation of shared use is frequently a first\n          step\
    \ toward development of roaming capabilities.  In fact, one\n          of the\
    \ ways by which a provider may offer roaming service is\n          to conclude\
    \ shared use agreements with multiple networks.\n          However, to date the\
    \ ability to accomplish this has been\n          hampered by lack of interoperability\
    \ among shared use\n          implementations.\n   non-IP dialup network\n   \
    \       This is a dialup network providing user access to the member\n       \
    \   systems via protocols other than IP.  These networks may\n          implement\
    \ phone book synchronization facilities, in order to\n          provide systems,\
    \ administrators and users with a current list\n          of participating systems.\
    \  Examples of non-IP dialup networks\n          supporting phone book synchronization\
    \ include FidoNet and\n          WWIVnet.\n"
- title: 4.  Global Reach Internet Consortium (GRIC)
  contents:
  - "4.  Global Reach Internet Consortium (GRIC)\n   Led by a US-based Internet technology\
    \ developer, AimQuest\n   Corporation, ten Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from\
    \ the USA,\n   Australia, China, Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan,\
    \ and\n   Thailand formed the Global Reach Internet Connection (GRIC) in May,\n\
    \   1996.  The goals of GRIC were to facilitate the implementation of a\n   global\
    \ roaming service and to coordinate billing and settlement among\n   the membership.\
    \  Commercial operation began in December of 1996, and\n   GRIC has grown to over\
    \ 100 major ISPs and Telcos from all over the\n   world, including NETCOM, USA;\
    \ KDD and Mitsubishi, Japan; iStar,\n   Canada; Easynet, UK; Connect.com, Australia;\
    \ Iprolink, Switzerland;\n   Singapore Telecom; Chunghwa Telecom, Taiwan; and\
    \ Telekom Malaysia.\n   Information on GRIC is available from http://www.gric.net/.\n\
    \   In implementing their roaming service, GRIC members have chosen\n   software\
    \ developed by AimQuest. AimQuest Corporation's roaming\n   implementation comprises\
    \ the following major components: the\n   AimTraveler Authentication Server (AAS),\
    \ the AimTraveler Routing\n   Server (ARS), and the AimQuest Internet Management\
    \ System (AIMS),\n   software designed to facilitate the billing process. Information\
    \ on\n   the AimQuest roaming implementation is available from\n   http://www.aimquest.com/.\n\
    \   The AimTraveler Authentication Server (AAS) runs at each member ISP\n   location,\
    \ and handles incoming authentication requests from NAS\n   devices and other\
    \ AASes. The AimTraveler Routing Server (ARS) can run\n   anywhere.  A single\
    \ routing server can be used where centralized\n   routing is desired, or multiple\
    \ routing servers can be run in order\n   to increase speed and reliability or\
    \ to gateway to networks of\n   particularly large partners.\n   The first version\
    \ of the AimTraveler software, deployed by AimQuest\n   in May, 1996, supported\
    \ direct authentication between members of the\n   roaming consortium, but as\
    \ GRIC grew, management of the relationships\n   between the authentication servers\
    \ became a problem. In August. 1996,\n   AimQuest began development of the AimTraveler\
    \ Routing Server (ARS) in\n   order to improve scalability.\n   The routing server\
    \ is comprised of two elements: The Central\n   Accounting Server and the Central\
    \ Routing Server.  The Central\n   Accounting Server collects all the roaming\
    \ accounting data for\n   settlement.  The Central Routing Server manages and\
    \ maintains\n   information on the authentication servers in the roaming consortium.\n\
    \   Adding, deleting, or updating ISP authentication server information\n   (e.g.\
    \ adding a new member ISP) may be accomplished by editing of a\n   configuration\
    \ file on the Central Routing Server. The configuration\n   files of the AimTraveler\
    \ Authentication Servers do not need to be\n   modified.\n   The AimTraveler Authentication\
    \ and Routing Servers are available for\n   various UNIX platforms. Versions for\
    \ Windows NT are under\n   development.  The AimTraveler Authentication Server\
    \ supports both the\n   UNIX password file and Kerberos.\n   The AimQuest Internet\
    \ Management System (AIMS) is designed for large\n   ISPs who need a centralized\
    \ management system for all ISP operations,\n   including sales, trouble-ticketing,\
    \ service, and billing.  AIMS\n   produces usage and transaction statement reports,\
    \ and includes a\n   settlement module to produce settlement/billing reports for\
    \ the\n   roaming consortium members.  Based on these reports, the providers\n\
    \   charge their ISP/roaming customers, and pay/settle the roaming\n   balance\
    \ among the providers.  AIMS currently runs on\n   Sun/Solaris/Oracle. A version\
    \ for Windows NT and SQL Server is\n   expected to become available in Q4 1996.\n"

- title: 4.6.  Authentication
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Authentication\n   GRIC implements distributed authentication, utilizing\
    \ the user's e-\n   mail address as the userID (i.e. \"liu@Aimnet.com\") presented\
    \ to the\n   remote NAS device.\n   After the initial PPP authentication exchange,\
    \ the userID, domain,\n   and pasword information (or in the case of CHAP, the\
    \ challenge and\n   the response) are then passed by the NAS to the AimTraveler\n\
    \   Authentication Server which supports both TACACS+ and RADIUS.\n   If the authentication\
    \ request comes from a regular customer login,\n   normal user id and password\
    \ authentication is performed. If the user\n   requesting authentication is a\
    \ \"roamer,\" (has a userID with an @ and\n   domain name), the authentication\
    \ server sends an query to the closest\n   routing server. When AimTraveler Routing\
    \ Server receives the\n   authentication request, it first authenticates the AAS\
    \ sending the\n   request, and if this is successful, it checks its authentication\n\
    \   server table.  If it is able to match the domain of the user to that\n   of\
    \ a \"Home ISP\", then the Home ISP authentication server's routing\n   information\
    \ are sent back to the local ISP's authentication server.\n   Based on the information\
    \ received from the routing server, the AAS\n   makes an authentication request\
    \ to the user's Home ISP AAS for user\n   id and password verification.\n   If\
    \ the user is a valid user, the Home ISP authentication server sends\n   a \"\
    permission granted\" message back to the Local ISP authentication\n   server.\
    \ The Local ISP authentication server then requests the NAS to\n   grant the user\
    \ a dynamic IP address from its address pool. If the\n   username or password\
    \ is incorrect, the Home ISP AAS will send a\n   rejection message to the Local\
    \ ISP AAS, and the user will be dropped\n   by the NAS.\n   If multiple routing\
    \ servers are installed, and the query to the first\n   routing server does not\
    \ result in a match, the query is forwarded to\n   the next routing server. The\
    \ server queries are cached on the routing\n   servers, improving speed for repeated\
    \ queries. The cache is sustained\n   until a routing server table entry is updated\
    \ or deleted.  Updating\n   or deleting results in a message to all neighbor routing\
    \ servers to\n   delete their caches.\n   The local authentication server also\
    \ receives the accounting data\n   from the NAS.  If the data is for a regular\
    \ customer login, the data\n   is written to the Local ISP AAS log file. If the\
    \ data is for a\n   \"roamer,\" the data is written to three places: the Local\
    \ ISP AAS log\n   file, the Home ISP AAS log file, and the ARS log file.\n   If\
    \ the local ISP authentication server has caching turned on, then it\n   will\
    \ cache information on Home ISP authentication server\n   configurations sent\
    \ by the routing server. This means that if the\n   same domain is queried again,\
    \ the local authentication server does\n   not need to query the routing server\
    \ again. The local cache is\n   cleared when the local authentication server receives\
    \ an update\n   message from the routing server or system manager.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.7.  NAS Configuration/Authorization\n   AimTraveler is comprised of two components,\
    \ a Client(AAS) and a\n   Server(ARS).\n   The AimTraveler Client acts as the\
    \ PPP dial-up authentication server.\n   When it detects an '@' sign in the userID\
    \ field, it queries the\n   AimTraverler Server for routing information, then\
    \ forwards the\n   authentication request to user's home authentication server.\
    \  The\n   AimTraveler Server, a centralized routing server, contains the\n  \
    \ authorized ISP's domain name, authentication servers and other\n   information.\n\
    \   The AimTraveler currently supports RADIUS and TACACS+, and could be\n   extended\
    \ to support other authentication protocols.  It also receives\n   all the accounting\
    \ records, which are subsequently used as input data\n   for billing.\n   Since\
    \ ISPs' NAS devices may be configured differently, the attributes\n   returned\
    \ by the home ISP AAS are discarded.\n"

    \ support token cards or tunneling protocols.\n"
- title: 4.10.  Accounting
  contents:
  - "4.10.  Accounting\n   The AimTraveler Authentication Server (AAS) software can\
    \ act as\n   either a RADIUS or TACACS+ accounting server.  When accounting\n\
    \   information is received from the NAS, the local AimTraveler\n   Authentication\
    \ Server (AAS) sends accounting data (user name, domain\n   name, login time)\
    \ to both the Central Accounting Server (part of the\n   ARS) and the user's Home\
    \ ISP AimTraveler authentication server. In\n   the case of GRIC, the Central\
    \ Accounting Server is run by AimQuest.\n   The data sent to the central accounting\
    \ server and home ISP are\n   identical except for the form of user id and time\
    \ stamp.  For a\n   traveler whose home ISP is in the US, but who is traveling\
    \ in Japan,\n   the Local (Japanese) ISP AimTraveler authentication server will\n\
    \   receive an accounting record timestamped with Japan time while the\n   Home\
    \ (US) ISP AimTraveler authentication server will receive an\n   accounting record\
    \ timestamped with the appropriate US timezone.\n   The accounting data includes\
    \ 2 new attributes for settlement\n   reporting:\n     Attribute             \

    \       101     string\n     Isp-ID                  102     string\n   The Roaming-Server-ID\
    \ attribute identifies the AAS sending the\n   authentication request.  The Isp-ID\
    \ attribute identifies the local\n   ISP.  Using this information the home ISP\
    \ can track the roaming\n   activities of its users (where their users are logging\
    \ in).\n   The AimTraveler Server running at AimQuest keeps a record of all\n\
    \   roaming transactions, which are used as input to the settlement and\n   billing\
    \ process.  At the end of each month, AimQuest provides a\n   roaming transaction\
    \ summary to GRIC members using AIMS. The AIMS\n   software is configurable so\
    \ that it takes into account the settlement\n   rules agreed to by GRIC members.\n"

    \ and will handle local authentication accordingly.  If \"user-\n   name@realm\"\
    \ is used, the RADIUS proxy/server will process it as a\n   roaming request.\n\
    \   When the RADIUS proxy/server handles a request from a roaming user,\n   it\
    \ will first check the cache to see if the user information is\n   already stored\
    \ there. If there is a cache hit, the RADIUS\n   proxy/server do the local authentication\
    \ accordingly.  If it does not\n   find user information in its cache, it will\
    \ act as a proxy,\n   forwarding the authentication request to the home RADIUS\
    \ server.\n   When the home RADIUS server responds, the local server will forward\n\
    \   the response to the NAS.  If the user is authenticated by the home\n   server,\
    \ the local RADIUS proxy will cache the user information for a\n   period of time\
    \ (3 days by default).\n   Caching is used to avoid frequent proxying of requests\
    \ and responses\n   between the local RADIUS proxy and the home RADIUS server.\
    \  When the\n   home RADIUS server sends back a valid authentication response,\
    \ the\n   local RADIUS proxy/server will cache the user information for a\n  \
    \ period of time (3 days by default).  When the user next authenticates\n   directly\
    \ against the home RADIUS server, the home RADIUS server will\n   send a request\
    \ to the local server or servers to clear the user's\n   information from the\

  - "6.4.1.  Extended hierarchy\n   In some provinces, the local telecommunications\
    \ administration\n   Provincial ISP) further delegates control to county access\
    \ nodes,\n   creating another level of hierarchy. This is done to improve\n  \
    \ scalability and to avoid having the provincial ISP databases grow too\n   large.\
    \  In the current implementation, each provincial ISP maintains\n   its own central\
    \ RADIUS server, including information on all users in\n   the province, while\
    \ county nodes maintain distributed RADIUS servers.\n   For intra-province roaming\
    \ requests the local RADIUS proxy/server\n   will directly forward the request\

    \ the local RADIUS server\n   does not forward the request directly to the home\
    \ RADIUS server.\n   Instead, the request is forwarded to the central provincial\
    \ RADIUS\n   server for the home province. This implementation is suitable only\n\
    \   when county level ISPs do not mind combining and sharing their user\n   information.\
    \  In this instance, this is acceptable, since all county\n   level ISPs are part\
    \ of China Telecom. In a future release, this\n   multi-layer hierarchy will be\

    \ who\n   do not have a Shanghai Online account. In order to support this, the\n\
    \   Shanghai Online servers function as a RADIUS client authenticating\n   against\
    \ the home RADIUS server. When users access a protected\n   document on the HTTP\
    \ server, they are prompted to send a\n   username/password for authentication.\
    \ The user then responds with\n   their userID in \"user-name@realm\" notation.\n\
    \   A CGI script on the HTTP server then acts as a RADIUS authentication\n   client,\

  - "7.8.  NAS configuration/authorization\n   Although the attributes returned by\
    \ the home RADIUS server may make\n   sense to home NAS devices, the local NAS\
    \ may be configured\n   differently, or may be from a different vendor.  As a\
    \ result, it may\n   be necessary for the RADIUS proxy to edit the attribute set\
    \ returned\n   by the home RADIUS server, in order to provide the local NAS with\
    \ the\n   appropriate configuration information.  The editing occurs via\n   attribute\
    \ discard and insertion of attributes by the proxy.\n   Alternatively, the home\
    \ RADIUS server may be configured not to return\n   any network-specific attributes,\
    \ and to allow these to be inserted by\n   the local RADIUS proxy.\n   Attributes\
    \ most likely to cause conflicts include:\n      Framed-IP-Address Framed-IP-Netmask\
    \ Framed-Routing Framed-Route\n      Filter-Id Vendor-Specific Session-Timeout\
    \ Idle-Timeout\n      Termination-Action\n   Conflicts relating to IP address\
    \ assignment and routing are very\n   common.  Where dynamic address assignment\
    \ is used, an IP address pool\n   appropriate for the local NAS can be substituted\
    \ for the IP address\n   pool designated by the home RADIUS server.\n   However,\
    \ not all address conflicts can be resolved by editing.  In\n   some cases, (i.e.,\
    \ assignment of a static network address for a LAN)\n   it may not be possible\
    \ for the local NAS to accept the home RADIUS\n   server's address assignment,\
    \ yet the roaming hosts may not be able to\n   accept an alternative assignment.\n\
    \   Filter IDs also pose a problem. It is possible that the local NAS may\n  \
    \ not implement a filter corresponding to that designated by the home\n   RADIUS\
    \ server. Even if an equivalent filter is implemented, in order\n   to guarantee\
    \ correct operation, the proxy's configuration must track\n   changes in the filter\
    \ configurations of each of the members of the\n   roaming consortium.  In practice\
    \ this is likely to be unworkable.\n   Direct upload of filter configuration is\
    \ not a solution either,\n   because of the wide variation in filter languages\
    \ supported in\n   today's NAS devices.\n   Since by definition vendor specific\
    \ attributes have meaning only to\n   devices created by that vendor, use of these\
    \ attributes is\n   problematic within a heterogeneous roaming consortium. While\
    \ it is\n   possible to edit these attributes, or even to discard them or allow\n\
    \   them to be ignored, this may not always be acceptable. In cases where\n  \
    \ vendor specific attributes relate to security, it may not be\n   acceptable\
    \ for the proxy to modify or discard these attributes; the\n   only acceptable\
    \ action may be for the local NAS to drop the user.\n   Unfortunately, RADIUS\
    \ does not distinguish between mandatory and\n   optional attributes, so that\
    \ there is no way for the proxy to take\n   guidance from the server.\n   Conflicts\
    \ over session or idle timeouts may result if since both the\n   local and home\
    \ ISP feel the need to adjust these parameters.  While\n   the home ISP may wish\
    \ to adjust the parameter to match the user's\n   software, the local ISP may\
    \ wish to adjust it to match its own\n   service policy. As long as the desired\
    \ parameters do not differ too\n   greatly, a compromise is often possible.\n"

    \ service site is owned and maintained by\n   either Merit or by a member or affiliate\
    \ organization. All sites must\n   support PPP and Telnet connections.\n   Each\
    \ organization participating in the shared dial-in service is\n   assigned a realm-name.\
    \  Typically the realm-name resembles a fully\n   qualified domain name. Users\
    \ accessing the shared dial-in service\n   identify themselves by using a MichNet\
    \ AccessID which consists of\n   their local id concatenated with \"@\" followed\
    \ by the realm-name -\n   e.g.  user@realm\n   Merit operates a set of Authentication,\
    \ Authorization and Accounting\n   (AAA) servers supporting the RADIUS protocol\
    \ which are called core\n   servers.  The core servers support all the dial-in\
    \ service sites and\n   act as proxy servers to other AAA servers running at the\n\
    \   participating organizations. For security reasons, Merit staff run\n   all\
    \ core servers; in particular, the user password is in the clear\n   when the\
    \ proxy core server decodes an incoming request and then re-\n   encodes it and\
    \ forwards it out again,\n   The core servers also enforce a common policy among\
    \ all dial-in\n   servers.  The most important policy is that each provider of\
    \ access\n   must make dial-in ports available to others when the provider's own\n\
    \   users do not have a need for them. To implement this policy, the\n   proxy\
    \ server distinguishes between realms that are owners and realms\n   that are\
    \ guests.\n   One piece of the policy determining whether the provider's\n   organization\
    \ has need of the port, is implemented by having the proxy\n   core server track\
    \ the realms associated with each of the sessions\n   connected at a particular\
    \ huntgroup. If there are few ports available\n   (where few is determined by\
    \ a formula) then guests are denied access.\n   Guests are also assigned a time\
    \ limit and their sessions are\n   terminated after some amount of time (currently\
    \ one hour during prime\n   time, two hours during non-prime time).\n   The other\
    \ part of the policy is to limit the number of guests that\n   are allowed to\
    \ connect.  This is done by limiting the number of\n   simultaneous guest sessions\
    \ for realms.  Each realm is allocated a\n   number of \"simultaneous access tokens\"\
    \ - SATs.  When a guest session\n   is authorized the end server for the realm\
    \ decrements the count of\n   available SATs, and when the session is terminated\
    \ the count of SATs\n   is incremented.  A Merit specific attribute is added to\
    \ the request\n   by the core if the session will be a \"guest\" and will require\
    \ a SAT.\n   The end server must include a reply with an attribute containing\
    \ the\n   name of the \"token pool\" from which the token for this session is\n\
    \   taken.  The effect of this is to limit the number of guests connected\n  \
    \ to the network to the total number of tokens allocated to all realms.\n   Each\
    \ realm is authenticated and authorized by its own AAA server. The\n   proxy core\
    \ servers forward requests to the appropriate server based\n   on a configuration\
    \ file showing where each realm is to be\n   authenticated.  Requests from realms\
    \ not in the configuration are\n   dropped.\n   The Merit AAA server software\
    \ supports this policy.  Merit provides\n   this software to member and affiliate\
    \ organizations. The software is\n   designed to work with many existing authentication\
    \ servers, such as\n   Kerberos IV, UNIX password, TACACS, TACACS+, and RADIUS.\

    \ either\n   using an AccessID and password within a script, or using PAP.\n \
    \  Support for challenge/response authentication mechanisms using EAP is\n   under\
    \ development.\n   When a user dials into a MichNet shared dial-in port, the NAS\
    \ sends\n   an Access-Request to a core AAA server using the RADIUS protocol.\n\
    \   First the core server applies any appropriate huntgroup access\n   policies\
    \ to the request. If the Request fails the policy check, an\n   Access-Reject\
    \ is returned to the NAS.  Otherwise, the core server\n   forwards it to the user's\

    \ sent, the home\n   server will create a dial-in session identifier which is\
    \ unique to\n   this session and insert it in a Class attribute in the Access-Accept.\n\
    \   The core server looks at the request and the response from the home\n   server\

    \ but a Huntgroup-Service attribute\n   is sent to the home authentication server\
    \ with its value being the\n   name of the service, and a copy of the attribute\
    \ must be returned by\n   the home server with a flag appended to the original\
    \ value to\n   indicate a positive authorization of user access to the specified\n\
    \   service.\n   The MichNet shared dial-in service typically requires authorization\n\
    \   of some sort, for example, a user dialing into a huntgroup as a guest\n  \
    \ must be authorized with a token from the user's realm. Participating\n   institutions\
    \ have control in defining authorization rules.  Currently\n   authorization may\

  contents:
  - "8.3.  Accounting\n   In the Merit AAA server, a session is defined as starting\
    \ from the\n   moment the user connects to the NAS, and ending at the point when\
    \ the\n   user disconnects. During the course of a session, both the core\n  \
    \ server and the home server maintain status information about the\n   session.\
    \  This allows the AAA servers to apply policies based on the\n   current status,\
    \ e.g. limit guest access by realm to number of\n   available tokens, or to limit\
    \ number of simultaneous sessions for a\n   given AccessID. Information such as\
    \ whether the session is for a\n   guest, whether it used a token, and other information\
    \ is included\n   with the accounting stop information when it is logged. Merit\
    \ has\n   made enhancements to the RADIUS protocol, that are local to the AAA\n\
    \   server, to support maintenance of session status information.\n   When a user\
    \ session is successfully authenticated, the NAS sends out\n   a RADIUS accounting\
    \ start request to the core server. The core server\n   forwards that request\
    \ to the user's home server.  The home server\n   updates the status of the session\
    \ and then responds to the core. The\n   core server in turn responds to the NAS.\
    \  In the accounting Start\n   request, a NAS conforming to the RADIUS specification\
    \ must return the\n   Class attribute and value it received in the Access-Accept\
    \ for the\n   session, thus sending back the dial-in session identifier created\
    \ by\n   the session's home server.\n   When a user ends a session, an accounting\
    \ stop request is sent\n   through the same path.  the same path.  The dial-in\
    \ session\n   identifier is again returned by the NAS, providing a means of\n\
    \   uniquely identifying a session.  By configuring the finite state\n   machine\
    \ in each of the AAA servers, any accounting requests may be\n   logged by any\
    \ of the servers where the accounting requests are\n   received.\n   Because the\
    \ same session logs are available on every server in the\n   path of a session's\
    \ authorization and accounting message, problems\n   with reconciliation of specific\
    \ sessions may be resolved easily. For\n   the shared dial-in service, there are\
    \ no usage charges.  Merit has\n   tools to verify that organizations do not authorize\
    \ more guest\n   sessions than the number of SATs allocated to the organization.\
    \  For\n   surcharged sessions, Merit sends each organization a summary bill\n\
    \   each month. Files with detail session records are available for\n   problem\
    \ resolution.  Each organization is responsible for billing its\n   own users,\
    \ and should have the same session records as are collected\n   by Merit.\n  \
    \ Merit receives a monthly invoice from other dial-in service providers\n   and\

    \ they wish to\n   contact. As a result users do not need to maintain copies of\
    \ the\n   Nodelist on their own systems. This is similar to the Internet, where\n\
    \   the DNS takes care of the domain name to IP address mapping, so that\n   users\
    \ do not have to remember IP addresses.\n   Nevertheless, FidoNet systems often\
    \ find it useful to be able to\n   present lists of nodes, and as a result, FidoNet\
    \ Nodelist compilers\n   typically produce a representation of the Nodelist that\

    \ in detail in [3].  The\n   Nodelist file consists of lines of data as well as\
    \ comment lines,\n   which begin with a semi-colon.  The first line of the Nodelist\
    \ is a\n   general interest comment line that includes the date and the day\n\
    \   number, as well as a 16-bit CRC. The CRC is included so as to allow\n   the\
    \ system assembling the new Nodelist to verify its integrity.\n   Each Nodelist\
    \ data line contains eight comma separated fields:\n      Keyword\n      Zone/Region/Net/Node\

    \ regions file. Among other\n   things, the keyword field can be used to indicate\
    \ that a system is\n   temporarily out of service.\n   Reference [3] discusses\
    \ Nodelist flags in considerable detail.  Among\n   other things, the flags include\
    \ information on supported modem\n   modulation and error correction protocols.\
    \  Reference [4] also\n   proposes a series of ISDN capability flags, and [5]\
    \ proposes flags to\n   indicate times of system availability.\n"

    \  In\n   order to receive Nodediffs and compile the Nodelist, the following\n\
    \   software is required:\n      A FidoNet-compatible mailer implementation, used\
    \ to transfer files\n      A Nodelist compiler\n   One of the purposes of the\
    \ Nodelist compiler is to apply Nodediffs to\n   the previous Nodelist in order\
    \ to produce an updated Nodelist.  The\n   other purpose is to compile the updated\
    \ Nodelist into the format\n   required by the particular mailer implementation\
    \ used by the member\n   system.  It is important to note that while the Nodelist\
    \ and Nodediff\n   formats are standardized (FTS-0005), as is the file transfer\
    \ protocol\n   (FTS-0001), the compiled format used by each mailer is implementation\n\
    \   dependent.\n   One reason that compiled formats to differ is the addition\
    \ of out of\n   band information to the Nodelist during the compilation process.\n\

    \   support the addition of cost information. This information is then\n   subsequently\
    \ used to guide mailer behavior.\n   Since phone call costs depend on the rates\
    \ charged by the local phone\n   company, this information is local in nature\
    \ and is typically entered\n   into the Nodelist compiler's configuration file\
    \ by the system\n   administrator.\n"

    \ preparation and transmission of the Nodediffs. A single shared\n   secret is\
    \ used per system.\n"
- title: 9.6.  Accounting
  contents:
  - "9.6.  Accounting\n   Within FidoNet, the need for accounting arises primarily\
    \ from the\n   need of local, regional and zone coordinators to be reimbursed\
    \ for\n   their expenses.  In order to support this, utilities have been\n   developed\
    \ to account for network usage at the system level according\n   to various metrics.\
    \  However, the accounting techniques are not\n   applied at the user level. Distributed\
    \ authentication and acounting\n   are not implemented and therefore users may\
    \ not roam between systems.\n"
