  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    [RFC5440]\n   provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform\n
    \  path computations in response to Path Computation Client (PCC)\n   requests.\n
    \  Further, in order to support use cases described in [RFC8051],\n   [RFC8231]
    specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to enable stateful\n   control of MPLS-TE
    and GMPLS LSPs via PCEP.  [RFC8281] describes the\n   setup, maintenance, and
    teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the\n   stateful PCE model.\n   In Section
    9 of [RFC5440], IANA assigns values to the PCEP protocol\n   parameters (messages,
    objects, TLVs).  IANA established a top-level\n   registry to contain all PCEP
    codepoints and sub-registries.  This\n   top-level registry contains sub-registries
    for PCEP message, object\n   and TLV types.  The allocation policy for each of
    these sub-\n   registries is IETF Review [RFC8126].  Also, early allocation\n
    \  [RFC7120] provides some latitude for allocation of these codepoints\n   but
    is reserved for features that are considered appropriately\n   stable.\n   Recently,
    there have been rapid advancements in PCE technology, which\n   has created an
    enhanced need to experiment with PCEP.  It is often\n   necessary to use some
    sort of number or constant in order to actually\n   test or experiment with the
    new function, even when testing in a\n   closed environment.  In order to run
    experiments, it is important\n   that the value not collide with existing codepoints
    or any future\n   allocations.\n   This document updates [RFC5440] by changing
    the allocation policies\n   for these three registries to mark some of the codepoints
    as assigned\n   for Experimental Use.  As stated in [RFC3692], experiments using\n
    \  these codepoints are not intended to be used in general deployments,\n   and
    due care must be taken to ensure that two experiments using the\n   same codepoints
    are not run in the same environment.  See [RFC3692]\n   for further discussion
    of the use of experimental codepoints (also\n   referred to as \"experimental
    and testing numbers\").\n"

    in\n   Section 6.1.\n"

  - "3.  Experimental PCEP Objects\n   PCEP objects are identified by values in the
    range 0 to 255.  This\n   document sets aside object identifiers 248-255 for experimentation
    as\n   described in Section 6.2.\n"

    as described\n   in Section 6.2.\n"
  title: 4.  Experimental PCEP TLVs
- contents:
  - "5.  Handling of Unknown Experimentation\n   A PCEP implementation that receives
    an experimental PCEP message that\n   it does not recognize reacts by sending
    a PCErr message with\n   Error-Type=2 (capability not supported) per Section 6.9
    of [RFC5440].\n   If a PCEP speaker does not understand or support an experimental\n
    \  object, then the way it handles this situation depends on the message\n   type.
    \ For example, a PCE handles an unknown object in the Path\n   Computation Request
    (PCReq) message according to the rules of\n   [RFC5440].  Message-specific behavior
    may be specified (e.g.,\n   [RFC8231] defines rules for a PCC to handle an unknown
    object in a\n   Path Computation LSP Update Request (PCUpd) message).\n   As per
    Section 7.1 of [RFC5440], an unknown experimental PCEP TLV\n   would be ignored.\n"

    of experimental codepoints\n   introduce no new security considerations.  However,
    implementations\n   accepting experimental codepoints need to take care in how
    they parse\n   and process the messages, objects, and TLVs in case they come,\n
    \  accidentally, from another experiment.  Further, an implementation\n   accepting
    experimental codepoints needs to consider the security\n   aspects of the experimental
    extensions.  [RFC6709] provides various\n   design considerations for protocol
    extensions (including those\n   designated as experimental).\n"
