    \   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is defining the\n   Evolved\
    \ 3GPP Packet Switched Domain - also known as the Evolved\n   Packet System (EPS).\
    \  As part of this architecture, the interfaces\n   based on the Diameter protocol\
    \ [RFC3588] require the definition of\n   two new Diameter applications.\n   As\
    \ defined in [TS29.272], the 3GPP S6a/S6d application (vendor-\n   specific application\
    \ id: 16777251) enables the transfer of\n   subscriber-related data between the\
    \ Mobile Management Entity (MME)\n   and the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) on the\
    \ S6a interface and between\n   the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) and the Home\
    \ Subscriber Server\n   (HSS) on the S6d interface.\n   Also defined in [TS29.272],\
    \ the 3GPP S13/S13' application (vendor-\n   specific application id: 16777252)\
    \ enables the Mobile Equipment\n   Identity check procedure between the Mobile\
    \ Management Entity (MME)\n   and the Equipment Identity Register (EIR) on the\
    \ S13 interface and\n   between the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) and the Equipment\n\
    \   Identity Register (EIR) on the S13' interface.\n   Both Diameter applications\
    \ are defined under the 3GPP vendor-id\n   \"10415\".  This document defines the\
    \ assigned values of the command\n   codes used in these applications.\n2.  Terminology\n\
    \   The base Diameter specification (Section 1.3 of [RFC3588]) defines\n   most\
    \ of the terminology used in this document.  Additionally, the\n   terms and acronyms\
    \ defined in [TS29.272] are used in this document.\n3.  Command Codes\n   The\
    \ 3GPP S6a/S6d application described in Section 5 of [TS29.272]\n   requires the\
    \ allocation of command code values for the following\n   command pairs:\n   o\
    \  3GPP-Update-Location-Request/Answer (ULR/ULA)\n   o  3GPP-Cancel-Location-Request/Answer\
    \ (CLR/CLA)\n   o  3GPP-Authentication-Information-Request/ Answer (AIR/AIA)\n\
    \   o  3GPP-Insert-Subscriber-Data-Request/Answer (IDR/IDA)\n   o  3GPP-Delete-Subscriber-Data-Request/Answer\
    \ (DSR/DSA)\n   o  3GPP-Purge-UE-Request/Answer (PUR/PUA)\n   o  3GPP-Reset-Request/Answer\
    \ (RSR/RSA)\n   o  3GPP-Notify-Request/Answer (NOR/NOA)\n   The 3GPP S13/S13 application\
    \ described in Section 6 of [TS29.272]\n   requires the allocation of a command\
    \ code value for the following\n   command pair:\n   o  3GPP-ME-Identity-Check-Request/Answer\
    \ (ECR/ECA)\n4.  IANA Considerations\n   This section provides guidance to the\
    \ Internet Assigned Numbers\n   Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values\
    \ related to the\n   Diameter protocol, in accordance with BCP 26 [RFC5226].\n\
    \   This document defines values in the namespace that has been defined\n   in\
    \ the Diameter base specification [RFC3588].  Section 11 of\n   [RFC3588] (that\
    \ document's IANA Considerations) details the\n   assignment criteria.  IANA allocated\
    \ the following command code\n   values:\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\

    5.  Security Considerations\n   This document describes command codes used in\
    \ applications that build\n   on top of the Diameter base protocol and the same\
    \ security\n   considerations described in [RFC3588] are applicable to this\n\
    \   document.  No further extensions are required beyond the security\n   mechanisms\
    \ offered by [RFC3588].\n6.  Acknowledgements\n   We would like to thank the 3GPP\
    \ CT4 delegates, Victor Fajardo, and\n   Glen Zorn for their review and comments.\
