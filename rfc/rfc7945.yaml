- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a networking concept\
    \ that\n   arose from the desire to align the operation model of a network with\n\
    \   the model of its typical use.  For TCP/IP networks, this implies\n   changing\
    \ the mechanisms of data access and transport from a host-to-\n   host model to\
    \ a user-to-information model.  The premise is that the\n   effort invested in\
    \ changing models will be offset, or even surpassed,\n   by the potential of a\
    \ \"better\" network.  However, such a claim can be\n   validated only if it is\
    \ quantified.\n   Different ICN approaches are evaluated in the peer-reviewed\n\
    \   literature using a mixture of theoretical analysis, simulation and\n   emulation\
    \ techniques, and empirical (testbed) measurements.  The\n   specific methodology\
    \ employed may depend on the experimentation goal,\n   e.g., whether one wants\
    \ to evaluate scalability, quantify resource\n   utilization, or analyze economic\
    \ incentives.  In addition, though, we\n   observe that ease and convenience of\
    \ setting up and running\n   experiments can sometimes be a factor in published\
    \ evaluations.  As\n   discussed in [RFC7476], the development phase that ICN\
    \ is going\n   through and the plethora of approaches to tackle the hardest problems\n\
    \   make this a very active and growing research area but, on the\n   downside,\
    \ it also makes it more difficult to compare different\n   proposals on an equal\
    \ footing.\n   Performance evaluation using actual network deployments has the\n\
    \   advantage of realistic workloads and reflects the environment where\n   the\
    \ service or protocol is to be deployed.  In the case of ICN,\n   however, it\
    \ is not currently clear what qualifies as a \"realistic\n   workload\".  Trace-based\
    \ analysis of ICN is in its infancy, and more\n   work is needed towards defining\
    \ characteristic workloads for ICN\n   evaluation studies.  Accordingly, the experimental\
    \ process and the\n   evaluation methodology per se are actively being researched\
    \ for\n   different ICN architectures.  Numerous factors affect the\n   experimental\
    \ results, including the topology selected; the background\n   traffic that an\
    \ application is being subjected to; network conditions\n   such as available\
    \ link capacities, link delays, and loss-rate\n   characteristics throughout the\
    \ selected topology; failure and\n   disruption patterns; node mobility; and the\
    \ diversity of devices\n   used.\n   The goal of this document is to summarize\
    \ evaluation guidelines and\n   tools alongside suggested data sets and high-level\
    \ approaches.  We\n   expect this to be of interest to the ICN community as a\
    \ whole, as it\n   can assist researchers and practitioners alike to compare and\n\
    \   contrast different ICN designs, as well as with the state of the art\n   in\
    \ host-centric solutions, and identify the respective strengths and\n   weaknesses.\
    \  We note that, apart from the technical evaluation of the\n   functionality\
    \ of an ICN architecture, the future success of ICN will\n   be largely driven\
    \ by its deployability and economic viability.\n   Therefore, ICN evaluations\
    \ should assess incremental deployability in\n   the existing network environment\
    \ together with a view of how the\n   technical functions will incentivize deployers\
    \ to invest in the\n   capabilities that allow the architecture to spread across\
    \ the\n   network.\n   This document has been produced by the IRTF Information-Centric\n\
    \   Networking Research Group (ICNRG).  The main objective of the ICNRG\n   is\
    \ to couple ongoing ICN research in the above areas with solutions\n   that are\
    \ relevant for evolving the Internet at large.  The ICNRG\n   produces documents\
    \ that provide guidelines for experimental\n   activities in the area of ICN so\
    \ that different, alternative\n   solutions can be compared consistently, and\
    \ information sharing can\n   be accomplished for experimental deployments.  This\
    \ document\n   incorporates input from ICNRG participants and their corresponding\n\
    \   text contributions; it has been reviewed by several ICNRG active\n   participants\
    \ (see the Acknowledgments), and represents the consensus\n   of the research\
    \ group.  That said, note that this document does not\n   constitute an IETF standard;\
    \ see also [RFC5743].\n   The remainder of this document is organized as follows.\
    \  Section 2\n   presents various techniques and considerations for evaluating\n\
    \   different ICN architectures.  Section 3 discusses the impact of ICN\n   on\
    \ network security.  Section 4 surveys the tools currently available\n   to ICN\
    \ researchers.\n"
- title: 2.  Evaluation Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  Evaluation Considerations\n   It is clear that the way we evaluate IP networks\
    \ will not be directly\n   applicable to evaluating ICN.  In IP, the focus is\
    \ on the performance\n   and characteristics of end-to-end connections between\
    \ a source and a\n   destination.  In ICN, the \"source\" responding to a request\
    \ can be any\n   ICN node in the network and may change from request to request.\
    \  This\n   makes it difficult to use concepts like delay and throughput in a\n\
    \   traditional way.  In addition, evaluating resource usage in ICN is a\n   more\
    \ complicated task, as memory used for caching affects delays and\n   use of transmission\
    \ resources; see the discussion on resource\n   equivalents in Section 2.4.\n\
    \   There are two major types of evaluations of ICN that we see a need to\n  \
    \ make.  One type is to compare ICN to traditional networking, and the\n   other\
    \ type is to compare different ICN implementations and approaches\n   against\
    \ each other.\n   In this section, we detail some of the functional components\
    \ needed\n   when evaluating different ICN implementations and approaches.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Topology Selection
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Topology Selection\n   There's a wealth of earlier work on topology selection\
    \ for simulation\n   and performance evaluation of host-centric networks.  While\
    \ the\n   classic dumbbell topology is regarded as inappropriate for ICN, most\n\
    \   ICN studies so far have been based on that earlier work for host-\n   centric\
    \ networks [RFC7476].  However, there is no single topology\n   that can be used\
    \ to easily evaluate all aspects of ICN.  Therefore,\n   one should choose from\
    \ a range of topologies depending on the focus\n   of the evaluation.\n   For\
    \ scalability and resilience studies, there is a wide range of\n   synthetic topologies,\
    \ such as the Barabasi-Albert model [Barabasi99]\n   and the Watts-Strogatz small-world\
    \ topology [Watts98].  These allow\n   experiments to be performed whilst controlling\
    \ various key parameters\n   (e.g., node degree).  These synthetic topologies\
    \ are appropriate in\n   the general case, as there are no practical assurances\
    \ that a future\n   information-centric network will have the same topology as\
    \ any of\n   today's networks.\n   When studies look at cost (e.g., transit cost)\
    \ or migration to ICN,\n   realistic topologies should be used.  These can be\
    \ inferred from\n   Internet traces, such as the CAIDA Macroscopic Internet Topology\
    \ Data\n   Kit (http://www.caida.org/data/active/internet-topology-data-kit) and\n\
    \   Rocketfuel\n   (http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/networking/rocketfuel).\
    \  A\n   problem is the large size of the topology (approximately 45K\n   Autonomous\
    \ Systems, close to 200K links), which may limit the\n   scalability of the employed\
    \ evaluation tool.  Katsaros et al.\n   [Katsaros15] address this problem by using\
    \ scaled down topologies\n   created following the methodology described in [Dimitropoulos09].\n\
    \   Studies that focus on node or content mobility can benefit from\n   topologies\
    \ and their dynamic aspects as used in the Delay-Tolerant\n   Networking (DTN)\
    \ community.  As mentioned in [RFC7476], DTN traces\n   are available to be used\
    \ in such ICN evaluations.\n   As with host-centric topologies, defining just\
    \ a node graph will not\n   be enough for most ICN studies.  The experimenter\
    \ should also clearly\n   define and list the respective matrices that correspond\
    \ to the\n   network, storage, and computation capacities available at each node\n\
    \   as well as the delay characteristics of each link [Montage].  Real\n   values\
    \ for such parameters can be taken from existing platforms such\n   as iPlane\
    \ (http://iplane.cs.washington.edu).  Synthetic values could\n   be produced with\
    \ specific tools [Kaune09].\n"
- title: 2.2.  Traffic Load
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Traffic Load\n   In this subsection, we provide a set of common guidelines,\
    \ in the\n   form of what we will refer to as a content catalog for different\n\
    \   scenarios.  This catalog, which is based on previously published\n   work,\
    \ can be used to evaluate different ICN proposals, for instance,\n   on routing,\
    \ congestion control, and performance, and can be\n   considered as other kinds\
    \ of ICN contributions emerge.  As we are\n   still lacking ICN-specific traffic\
    \ workloads, we can currently only\n   extrapolate from today's workloads.  A\
    \ significant challenge then\n   relates to the identification of the applications\
    \ contributing to the\n   observed traffic (e.g., Web or peer-to-peer), as well\
    \ as to the exact\n   amount of traffic they contribute to the overall traffic\
    \ mixture.\n   Efforts in this direction can take heed of today's traffic mix\n\
    \   comprising Web, peer-to-peer file sharing, and User-Generated Content\n  \
    \ (UGC) platforms (e.g., YouTube), as well as Video on Demand (VoD)\n   services.\
    \  Publicly available traces for these include those from web\n   sites such as\
    \ the MultiProbe Framework\n   <http://multiprobe.ewi.tudelft.nl/multiprobe.html>,\n\
    \   <http://an.kaist.ac.kr/traces/IMC2007.html> (see also [Cha07]), and\n   the\
    \ UMass Trace Repository\n   <http://traces.cs.umass.edu/index.php/Network/Network>.\n\
    \   Taking a more systematic approach, and with the purpose of modeling\n   the\
    \ traffic load, we can resort to measurement studies that\n   investigate the\
    \ composition of Internet traffic, such as [Labovitz10]\n   and [Maier09].  In\
    \ [Labovitz10], a large-scale measurement study was\n   performed, with the purpose\
    \ of studying the traffic crossing inter-\n   domain links.  The results indicate\
    \ the dominance of Web traffic,\n   amounting to 52% over all measured traffic.\
    \  However, Deep Packet\n   Inspection (DPI) techniques reveal that 25-40% of\
    \ all HTTP traffic\n   actually carries video traffic.  Results from DPI techniques\
    \ also\n   reveal the difficulty in correctly identifying the application type\n\
    \   in the case of P2P traffic: mapping observed port numbers to well-\n   known\
    \ applications shows P2P traffic constituting only 0.85% of\n   overall traffic,\
    \ while DPI raises this percentage to 18.32%\n   [Labovitz10].  Relevant studies\
    \ on a large ISP show that the\n   percentage of P2P traffic ranges from 17% to\
    \ 19% of overall traffic\n   [Maier09].  Table 1 provides an overview of these\
    \ figures.  The\n   \"other\" traffic type denotes traffic that cannot be classified\
    \ in any\n   of the first three application categories, and it consists of\n \
    \  unclassified traffic and traffic heavily fragmented into several\n   applications\
    \ (e.g., 0.17% DNS traffic).\n                   Traffic Type | Ratio\n      \
    \             =====================\n                   Web          | 31-39%\n\

    \                   =====================\n   Table 1: Traffic Type Ratios of\
    \ Total Traffic [Labovitz10] [Maier09]\n   The content catalog for each type of\
    \ traffic can be characterized by\n   a specific set of parameters:\n   a) the\
    \ cardinality of the estimated content catalog\n   b) the size of the exchanged\
    \ contents (either chunks or entire named\n      information objects)\n   c) the\
    \ popularity of objects (expressed in their request frequency)\n   In most application\
    \ types, the popularity distribution follows some\n   power law, indicating that\
    \ a small number of information items\n   trigger a large proportion of the entire\
    \ set of requests.  The exact\n   shape of the power law popularity distribution\
    \ directly impacts the\n   performance of the underlying protocols.  For instance,\
    \ highly skewed\n   popularity distributions (e.g., a Zipf-like distribution with\
    \ a high\n   slope value) favor the deployment of caching schemes, since caching\
    \ a\n   very small set of information items can dramatically increase the\n  \
    \ cache hit ratio.\n   Several studies in the past few years have stated that\
    \ Zipf's law is\n   the discrete distribution that best represents the request\
    \ frequency\n   in a number of application scenarios, ranging from the Web to\
    \ VoD\n   services.  The key aspect of this distribution is that the frequency\n\
    \   of a content request is inversely proportional to the rank of the\n   content\
    \ itself, i.e., the smaller the rank, the higher the request\n   frequency.  If\
    \ M denotes the content catalog cardinality and 1 <= i\n   <= M denotes the rank\
    \ of the i-th most popular content, we can\n   express the probability of requesting\
    \ the content with rank \"i\" as:\n   P(X=i) = (1 / i^(alpha)) / C, with C = SUM(1\
    \ / j^(alpha)), alpha > 0\n   where the sum is obtained considering all values\
    \ of j, 1 <= j <= M.\n   A recent analysis of HTTP traffic showed that content\
    \ popularity is\n   better reflected by a trimodal distribution model in which\
    \ the head\n   and tail of a Zipf distribution (with slope value 0.84) are replaced\n\
    \   by two discrete Weibull distributions with shape parameter values 0.5\n  \
    \ and 0.24, respectively [IMB2014].\n   A variation of the Zipf distribution,\
    \ termed the Mandelbrot-Zipf\n   distribution was suggested [Saleh06] to better\
    \ model environments\n   where nodes can locally store previously requested content.\
    \  For\n   example, it was observed that peer-to-peer file-sharing applications\n\
    \   typically exhibited a 'fetch-at-most-once' style of behavior.  This\n   is\
    \ because peers tend to persistently store the files they download,\n   a behavior\
    \ that may also be prevalent in ICN.\n   Popularity can also be characterized\
    \ in terms of:\n   a) The temporal dynamics of popularity, i.e., how requests\
    \ are\n      distributed in time.  The popularity distribution expresses the\n\
    \      number of requests submitted for each information item\n      participating\
    \ into a certain workload.  However, they do not\n      describe how these requests\
    \ are distributed in time.  This aspect\n      is of primary importance when considering\
    \ the performance of\n      caching schemes since the ordering of the requests\
    \ obviously\n      affects the contents of a cache.  For example, with a Least\n\
    \      Frequently Used (LFU) cache replacement policy, if all requests\n     \
    \ for a certain item are submitted close in time, the item is\n      unlikely\
    \ to be evicted from the cache, even by a (globally) more\n      popular item\
    \ whose requests are more evenly distributed in time.\n      The temporal ordering\
    \ of requests gains even more importance when\n      considering workloads consisting\
    \ of various applications, all\n      competing for the same cache space.\n  \
    \ b) The spatial locality of popularity i.e., how requests are\n      distributed\
    \ throughout a network.  The importance of spatial\n      locality relates to\
    \ the ability to avoid redundant traffic in the\n      network.  If requests are\
    \ highly localized in some area of the\n      entire network, then similar requests\
    \ can be more efficiently\n      served with mechanisms such as caching and/or\
    \ multicast, i.e., the\n      concentration of similar requests in a limited area\
    \ of the network\n      allows increasing the perceived cache hit ratios at caches\
    \ in the\n      area and/or the traffic savings from the use of multicast.\n \
    \     Table 2 provides an overview of distributions that can be used to\n    \
    \  model each of the identified traffic types i.e., Web, Video (based\n      on\
    \ YouTube measurements), and P2P (based on BitTorrent\n      measurements).  These\
    \ distributions are the outcome of a series of\n      modeling efforts based on\
    \ measurements of real traffic workloads\n      ([Breslau99] [Mahanti00] [Busari02]\

    \      following these models, and also allowing the generation of\n      different\

  - "2.3.  Choosing Relevant Metrics\n   Quantification of network performance requires\
    \ a set of standard\n   metrics.  These metrics should be broad enough so they\
    \ can be applied\n   equally to host-centric and information-centric (or other)\
    \ networks.\n   This will allow reasoning about a certain ICN approach in relation\
    \ to\n   an earlier version of the same approach, to another ICN approach, or\n\
    \   to the incumbent host-centric approach.  It will therefore be less\n   difficult\
    \ to gauge optimization and research direction.  On the other\n   hand, the metrics\
    \ should be targeted to network performance only and\n   should avoid unnecessary\
    \ expansion into the physical and application\n   layers.  Similarly, at this\
    \ point, it is more important to capture as\n   metrics only the main figures\
    \ of merit and to leave more esoteric and\n   less frequent cases for the future.\n\
    \   To arrive at a set of relevant metrics, it would be beneficial to\n   look\
    \ at the metrics used in existing ICN approaches, such as Content-\n   Centric\
    \ Networking (CCN) [Jacobson09] [VoCCN] [Zhang10b], NetInf\n   [4WARD6.1] [4WARD6.3]\
    \ [SAIL-B2] [SAIL-B3], PURSUIT [PRST4.5], COMET\n   [CMT-D5.2] [CMT-D6.2], Connect\
    \ [Muscariello11] [Perino11], and\n   CONVERGENCE [Detti12] [Blefari-Melazzi12]\
    \ [Salsano12].  The metrics\n   used in these approaches fall into two categories:\
    \ metrics for the\n   approach as a whole, and metrics for individual components\
    \ (name\n   resolution, routing, and so on).  Metrics for the entire approach\
    \ are\n   further subdivided into traffic and system metrics.  It is important\n\
    \   to note that the various approaches do not name or define metrics\n   consistently.\
    \  This is a major problem when trying to find metrics\n   that allow comparison\
    \ between approaches.  For the purposes of\n   exposition, we have tried to smooth\
    \ over differences by classifying\n   similarly defined metrics under the same\
    \ name.  Also, due to space\n   constraints, we have chosen to report here only\
    \ the most common\n   metrics between approaches.  For more details, the reader\
    \ should\n   consult the references for each approach.\n   Traffic metrics in\
    \ existing ICN approaches are summarized in Table 4.\n   These are metrics for\
    \ evaluating an approach mainly from the\n   perspective of the end user, i.e.,\
    \ the consumer, provider, or owner\n   of the content or service.  Depending on\
    \ the level where these\n   metrics are measured, we have made the distinction\
    \ into user,\n   application, and network-level traffic metrics.  So, for example,\n\
    \   network-level metrics are mostly focused on packet characteristics,\n   whereas\
    \ user-level metrics can cover elements of human perception.\n   The approaches\
    \ do not make this distinction explicitly, but we can\n   see from the table that\
    \ CCN and NetInf have used metrics from all\n   levels, PURSUIT and COMET have\
    \ focused on lower-level metrics, and\n   Connect and CONVERGENCE opted for higher-level\
    \ metrics.  Throughput\n   and download time seem to be the most popular metrics\

    \            Table 4: Traffic Metrics Used in ICN Evaluations\n   While traffic\
    \ metrics are more important for the end user, the owner\n   or operator of the\
    \ networking infrastructure is normally more\n   interested in system metrics,\
    \ which can reveal the efficiency of an\n   approach.  The most common system\
    \ metrics used are: protocol\n   overhead, total traffic, transit traffic, cost\
    \ savings, router cost,\n   and router energy consumption.\n   Besides the traffic\
    \ and systems metrics that aim to evaluate an\n   approach as a whole, all surveyed\
    \ approaches also evaluate the\n   performance of individual components.  Name\
    \ resolution, request/data\n   routing, and data caching are the most typical\
    \ components, as\n   summarized in Table 5.  Forwarding Information Base (FIB)\
    \ size and\n   path length, i.e., the routing component metrics, are almost\n\
    \   ubiquitous among approaches, perhaps due to the networking background\n  \
    \ of the involved researchers.  That might be also the reason for the\n   sometimes\

- title: 2.3.1.  Traffic Metrics
  contents:
  - "2.3.1.  Traffic Metrics\n   The IETF has been working for more than a decade\
    \ on devising metrics\n   and methods for measuring the performance of IP networks.\
    \  The work\n   has been carried out largely within the IP Performance Metrics\
    \ (IPPM)\n   working group, guided by a relevant framework [RFC2330].  IPPM\n\
    \   metrics include delay, delay variation, loss, reordering, and\n   duplication.\
    \  While the IPPM work is certainly based on packet-\n   switched IP networks,\
    \ it is conceivable that it can be modified and\n   extended to cover ICN networks\
    \ as well.  However, more study is\n   necessary to turn this claim into a certainty.\
    \  Many experts have\n   toiled for a long time on devising and refining the IPPM\
    \ metrics and\n   methods, so it would be an advantage to use them for measuring\
    \ ICN\n   performance.  In addition, said metrics and methods work already for\n\
    \   host-centric networks, so comparison with information-centric\n   networks\
    \ would entail only the ICN extension of the IPPM framework.\n   Finally, an important\
    \ benefit of measuring the transport performance\n   of a network at its output,\
    \ using Quality of Service (QoS) metrics\n   such as IPPM, is that it can be done\
    \ mostly without any dependence to\n   applications.\n   Another option for measuring\
    \ transport performance would be to use\n   QoS metrics, not at the output of\
    \ the network like with IPPM, but at\n   the input to the application.  For a\
    \ live video-streaming application\n   the relevant metrics would be startup latency,\
    \ playout lag, and\n   playout continuity.  The benefit of this approach is that\
    \ it\n   abstracts away all details of the underlying transport network, so it\n\
    \   can be readily applied to compare between networks of different\n   concepts\
    \ (host-centric, information-centric, or other).  As implied\n   earlier, the\
    \ drawback of the approach is its dependence on the\n   application, so it is\
    \ likely that different types of applications\n   will require different metrics.\
    \  It might be possible to identify\n   standard metrics for each type of application,\
    \ but the situation is\n   not as clear as with IPPM metrics, and further investigation\
    \ is\n   necessary.\n   At a higher level of abstraction, we could measure the\
    \ network's\n   transport performance at the application output.  This entails\n\
    \   measuring the quality of the transported and reconstructed\n   information\
    \ as perceived by the user during consumption.  In such an\n   instance we would\
    \ use Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics, which are\n   by definition dependent\
    \ on the application.  For example, the\n   standardized methods for obtaining\
    \ a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for\n   VoIP (e.g., ITU-T Recommendation P.800) is\
    \ quite different from those\n   for IPTV (e.g., Perceptual Evaluation of Video\
    \ Quality (PEVQ)).\n   These methods are notoriously hard to implement, as they\
    \ involve real\n   users in a controlled environment.  Such constraints can be\
    \ relaxed\n   or dropped by using methods that model human perception under certain\n\
    \   environments, but these methods are typically intrusive.  The most\n   important\
    \ drawback of measuring network performance at the output of\n   the application\
    \ is that only one part of each measurement is related\n   to network performance.\
    \  The rest is related to application\n   performance, e.g., video coding, or\
    \ even device capabilities, both of\n   which are irrelevant to our purposes here\
    \ and are generally hard to\n   separate.  We therefore see the use of QoE metrics\
    \ in measuring ICN\n   performance as a poor choice at this stage.\n"
- title: 2.3.2.  System Metrics

  - "2.3.2.  System Metrics\n   Overall system metrics that need to be considered\
    \ include\n   reliability, scalability, energy efficiency, and delay/disconnection\n\
    \   tolerance.  In deployments where ICN is addressing specific\n   scenarios,\
    \ relevant system metrics could be derived from current\n   experience.  For example,\
    \ in Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios,\n   which are discussed in [RFC7476],\
    \ it is reasonable to consider the\n   current generation of sensor nodes, sources\
    \ of information, and even\n   measurement gateways (e.g., for smart metering\
    \ at homes) or\n   smartphones.  In this case, ICN operation ought to be evaluated\
    \ with\n   respect not only to overall scalability and network efficiency, but\n\
    \   also the impact on the nodes themselves.  Karnouskos et al.\n   [SensReqs]\
    \ provide a comprehensive set of sensor and IoT-related\n   requirements, for\
    \ example, which include aspects such as resource\n   utilization, service life-cycle\
    \ management, and device management.\n   Additionally, various specific metrics\
    \ are also critical in\n   constrained environments, such as processing requirements,\
    \ signaling\n   overhead, and memory allocation for caching procedures, in addition\n\
    \   to power consumption and battery lifetime.  For gateways (which\n   typically\
    \ act as a point of service to a large number of nodes and\n   have to satisfy\
    \ the information requests from remote entities), we\n   need to consider scalability-related\
    \ metrics, such as frequency and\n   processing of successfully satisfied information\
    \ requests.\n   Finally, given the in-network caching functionality of ICNs,\n\
    \   efficiency and performance metrics of in-network caching have to be\n   defined.\
    \  Such metrics will need to guide researchers and operators\n   regarding the\
    \ performance of in-network caching algorithms.  A first\n   step on this direction\
    \ has been made in [Psaras11].  The paper\n   proposes a formula that approximates\
    \ the proportion of time that a\n   piece of content stays in a network cache.\
    \  The model takes as input\n   the rate of requests for a given piece of content\
    \ (the Content of\n   Interest (CoI)) and the rate of requests for all other contents\
    \ that\n   go through the given network element (router) and move the CoI down\n\
    \   in the (LRU) cache.  The formula takes also into account the size of\n   the\
    \ cache of this router.\n   The output of the model essentially reflects the probability\
    \ that the\n   CoI will be found in a given cache.  An initial study [Psaras11]\
    \ is\n   applied to the CCN / Named Data Networking (NDN) framework, where\n \
    \  contents get cached at every node they traverse.  The formula\n   according\
    \ to which the probability or proportion is calculated is\n   given by:\n   pi\
    \ = [mu / (mu + lambda)]^N\n   where lambda is the request rate for the CoI, mu\
    \ is the request rate\n   for contents that move the CoI down the cache, and N\
    \ is the size of\n   the cache (in slots).\n   The formula can be used to assess\
    \ the caching performance of the\n   system and can also potentially be used to\
    \ identify the gain of the\n   system due to caching.  This can then be used to\
    \ compare against\n   gains by other factors, e.g., addition of extra bandwidth\
    \ in the\n   network.\n"

  - "2.4.  Resource Equivalence and Trade-Offs\n   As we have seen above, every ICN\
    \ network is built from a set of\n   resources, which include link capacities,\
    \ and different types of\n   memory structures and repositories used for storing\
    \ named data\n   objects and chunks temporarily (i.e., caching) or persistently,\
    \ as\n   well as name resolution and other lookup services.  A range of\n   engineering\
    \ trade-offs arise from the complexity and processing\n   requirements of forwarding\

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Authentication\n   For fully secure content distribution, content access\
    \ requires that\n   the receiver be able to reliably assess:\n      validity:\
    \   Is it a complete, uncorrupted copy of what was\n                  originally\
    \ published?\n      provenance: Can the receiver identify the publisher? If so,\
    \ can it\n                  and the source of any cached version of the document\n\
    \                  be adequately trusted?\n      relevance:  Is the content an\
    \ answer to the question that the\n                  receiver asked?\n   All ICN\
    \ architectures considered in this document primarily target\n   the validity\
    \ requirement using strong cryptographic means to tie the\n   content request\
    \ name to the content.  Provenance and relevance are\n   directly targeted to\
    \ varying extents:  There is a tussle or trade-off\n   between simplicity and\
    \ efficiency of access and level of assurance of\n   all these traits.  For example,\
    \ maintaining provenance information\n   can become extremely costly, particularly\
    \ when considering (historic)\n   relationships between multiple objects.  Architectural\
    \ decisions have\n   therefore been made in each case as to whether the assessment\
    \ is\n   carried out by the information-centric network or left to the\n   application.\n\
    \   An additional consideration for authentication is whether a name\n   should\
    \ be irrevocably and immutably tied to a static piece of\n   preexisting content\
    \ or whether the name can be used to refer to\n   dynamically or subsequently\
    \ generated content.  Schemes that only\n   target immutable content can be less\
    \ resource-hungry as they can use\n   digest functions rather than public key\
    \ cryptography for generating\n   and checking signatures.  However, this can\
    \ increase the load on\n   applications because they are required to manage many\
    \ names, rather\n   than use a single name for an item of evolving content that\
    \ changes\n   over time (e.g., a piece of data containing an age reference).\n\
    \   Data-Oriented Network Architecture (DONA) [DONA] and CCN [Jacobson09]\n  \
    \ [Smetters09] integrate most of the data needed to verify provenance\n   into\
    \ all content retrievals but need to be able to retrieve\n   additional information\
    \ (typically a security certificate) in order to\n   complete the provenance authentication.\
    \  Whether the application has\n   any control of this extra retrieval will depend\
    \ on the\n   implementation.  CCN is explicitly designed to handle dynamic content\n\
    \   allowing names to be pre-allocated and attached to subsequently\n   generated\
    \ content.  DONA offers variants for dynamic and immutable\n   content.\n   Publish-Subscribe\
    \ Internet Technology (PURSUIT) [Tagger12] appears to\n   allow implementers to\
    \ choose the authentication mechanism so that it\n   can, in theory, emulate the\
    \ authentication strategy of any of the\n   other architectures.  It is not clear\
    \ whether different choices would\n   lead to lack of interoperability.\n   NetInf\
    \ uses the Named Information (ni) URI scheme [RFC6920] to\n   identify content.\
    \  This allows NetInf to assure validity without any\n   additional information\
    \ but gives no assurance on provenance or\n   relevance.  A \"search\" request\
    \ allows an application to identify\n   relevant content, and applications may\
    \ choose to structure content to\n   allow provenance assurance, but this will\
    \ typically require\n   additional network access.  NetInf validity authentication\
    \ is\n   consequently efficient in a network environment with intermittent\n \
    \  connectivity as it does not force additional network accesses and\n   allows\
    \ the application to decide on provenance validation if\n   required.  For dynamic\
    \ content, NetInf can use, e.g., signed\n   manifests.  For more details on NetInf\
    \ security, see [Dannewitz10].\n"
- title: 3.2.  Authorization, Access Control, and Logging
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Authorization, Access Control, and Logging\n   A potentially major concern\
    \ for all ICN architectures considered here\n   is that they do not provide any\
    \ inbuilt support for an authorization\n   framework or for logging.  Once content\
    \ has been published and cached\n   in servers, routers, or endpoints not controlled\
    \ by the publisher,\n   the publisher has no way to enforce access control, determine\
    \ which\n   users have accessed the content, or revoke its publication.  In fact,\n\
    \   in some cases (where requests do not necessarily contain host/user\n   identifier\
    \ information), it is difficult for the publishers\n   themselves to perform access\
    \ control.\n   Access could be limited by encrypting the content, but the necessity\n\
    \   of distributing keys out-of-band appears to negate the advantages of\n   in-network\
    \ caching.  This also creates significant challenges when\n   attempting to manage\
    \ and restrict key access.  An authorization\n   delegation scheme has been proposed\
    \ [Fotiou12].  This scheme allows\n   semi-trusted entities (such as caches or\
    \ CDN nodes) to delegate\n   access control decisions to third-party access control\
    \ providers that\n   are trusted by the content publisher.  The former entities\
    \ have no\n   access to subscriber-related information and should respect the\n\
    \   decisions of the access control providers.\n   A recent proposal for an extra\
    \ layer in the protocol stack [LIRA]\n   gives control of the name resolution\
    \ infrastructure to the publisher.\n    This enables access logging as well some\
    \ degree of active cache\n   management, e.g., purging of stale content.\n   One\
    \ possible technique that could allow for providing access control\n   to heterogeneous\
    \ groups and still allow for a single encrypted object\n   representation that\
    \ remains cacheable is Attribute-Based Encryption\n   (ABE).  A first proposal\
    \ for this is presented in [Ion13].  To\n   support heterogeneous groups and avoid\
    \ having a single authority that\n   has a master key multi-authority, ABE can\
    \ be used [Lewko11].\n   Evaluating the impact of the absence of these features\
    \ will be\n   essential for any scenario where an ICN architecture might be\n\
    \   deployed.  It may have a seriously negative impact on the\n   applicability\
    \ of ICN in commercial environments unless a solution can\n   be found.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Privacy
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Privacy\n   Another area where the architectures have not been significantly\n\
    \   analyzed is privacy.  Caching implies a trade-off between network\n   efficiency\
    \ and privacy.  The activity of users is significantly more\n   exposed to the\
    \ scrutiny of cache owners with whom they may not have\n   any relationship. \
    \ However, it should be noted that it is only the\n   first-hop router/cache that\
    \ can see who requests what, as requests\n   are aggregated and only the previous-hop\
    \ router is visible when a\n   request is forwarded.\n   Although in many ICN\
    \ architectures the source of a request is not\n   explicitly identified, an attacker\
    \ may be able to obtain considerable\n   information if he or she can monitor\
    \ transactions on the cache and\n   obtain details of the objects accessed, the\
    \ topological direction of\n   requests, and information about the timing of transactions.\
    \  The\n   persistence of data in the cache can make life easier for an attacker\n\
    \   by giving a longer timescale for analysis.\n   The impact of CCN on privacy\
    \ has been investigated in [Lauinger10],\n   and the analysis is applicable to\
    \ all ICN architectures because it is\n   mostly focused on the common caching\
    \ aspect.  The privacy risks of\n   Named Data Networking are also highlighted\
    \ in [Lauinger12].  Further\n   work on privacy in ICNs can be found in [Chaabane13].\
    \  Finally,\n   Fotiou et al. define an ICN privacy evaluation framework in\n\
    \   [Fotiou14].\n"

  contents:
  - "3.4.  Changes to the Network Security Threat Model\n   The architectural differences\
    \ of the various ICN models versus TCP/IP\n   have consequences for network security.\
    \  There is limited\n   consideration of the threat models and potential mitigation\
    \ in the\n   various documents describing the architectures.  [Lauinger10] and\n\
    \   [Chaabane13] also consider the changed threat model.  Some of the key\n  \
    \ aspects are:\n      o  Caching implies a trade-off between network efficiency\
    \ and user\n         privacy as discussed in Section 3.3.\n      o  More-powerful\
    \ routers upgraded to handle persistent caching\n         increase the network's\
    \ attack surface.  This is particularly\n         the case in systems that may\
    \ need to perform cryptographic\n         checks on content that is being cached.\
    \  For example, not doing\n         this could lead routers to disseminate invalid\
    \ content.\n      o  ICNs makes it difficult to identify the origin of a request\
    \ (as\n         mentioned in Section 3.3), slowing down the process of blocking\n\
    \         requests and requiring alternative mechanisms to differentiate\n   \
    \      legitimate requests from inappropriate ones as access control\n       \
    \  lists (ACLs) will probably be of little value for ICN requests.\n      o  Denial-of-service\
    \ (DoS) attacks may require more effort on ICN\n         than on TCP/IP-based\
    \ host-centric networks, but they are still\n         feasible.  One reason for\
    \ this is that it is difficult for the\n         attacker to force repeated requests\
    \ for the same content onto a\n         single node; ICNs naturally spread content\
    \ so that after the\n         initial few requests, subsequent requests will generally\
    \ be\n         satisfied by alternative sources, blunting the impact of a DoS\n\
    \         attack.  That said, there are many ways around this, e.g.,\n       \
    \  generating random suffix identifiers that always result in\n         cache\
    \ misses.\n      o  Per-request state in routers can be abused for DoS attacks.\n\
    \      o  Caches can be misused in the following ways:\n         +  Attackers\
    \ can use caches as storage to make their own\n            content available.\n\
    \         +  The efficiency of caches can be decreased by attackers with\n   \
    \         the goal of DoS attacks.\n         +  Content can be extracted by any\
    \ attacker connected to the\n            cache, putting users' privacy at risk.\n\
    \   Appropriate mitigation of these threats will need to be considered in\n  \
    \ each scenario.\n"

    \  Icarus has several caching strategies\n   implemented, including among others\
    \ ProbCache [Psaras12], node-\n   centrality-based caching [Chai12], and hash-route-based\
    \ caching\n   [HASHROUT].\n   ProbCache [Psaras12] is taking a resource management\

    \ along the\n   path from source to destination.  Based on this approximation\

    \ to that.  The hash space is split\n   according to the number of caches of the\
