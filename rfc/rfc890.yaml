- title: Status of this Memo
  contents:
  - "Status of this Memo\n   This memo is a policy statement on the implementation\
    \ of the Exterior\n   Gateway Protocol in the Internet.  This is an official policy\n\
    \   statement of ICCB and DARPA.\n"
- title: The Current Situation
  contents:
  - "The Current Situation\n   Currently the Internet has a number of smart gateways\
    \ and a number of\n   dumb gateways.  The smart gateways dynamically exchange\
    \ routing\n   information among themselves using the Gateway Gateway\n   Protocol\
    \ (GGP) [3].  The dumb gateways do not exchange routing\n   information dynamically.\n\
    \   The dumb gateways must be listed in the smart gateway routing tables,\n  \
    \ and changes in dumb gateways status (e.g., adding new dumb gateways)\n   in\
    \ the smart gateways tables requires human intervention.\n   The amount of routing\
    \ traffic between smart gateways depends on the\n   number of smart gateways and\
    \ the total number of networks.  Since\n   dumb gateways typically connect a single\
    \ network at the edge of the\n   Internet, there is typically one more network\
    \ in the routing table\n   for each dumb gateway.\n   Gateways that connect a\
    \ single network to the edge of the Internet\n   may be called \"stub\" gateways.\n\
    \   The current GGP procedures used by the smart gateways are at the\n   limits\
    \ of their capacity.  A significant change to these procedures\n   is urgently\
    \ required.  This is difficult to perform because the smart\n   gateways are maintained\
    \ by several different groups, and because it\n   is difficult to isolate a subset\
    \ of these gateways for testing new\n   procedures.\n"
- title: The Future Situation
  contents:
  - "The Future Situation\n   In the future, as it is currently envisioned, there\
    \ will be a number\n   of co-equal autonomous systems of gateways.  Each as will\
    \ have its\n   own private internal procedures for maintaining routing information,\n\
    \   perhaps via an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP).  The smartness of a\n   gateway\
    \ will be the smartness of the IGP used in the autonomous\n   system the gateway\
    \ participates in.  Some gateways of each autonomous\n   system will exchange\
    \ routing informations with some gateways of other\n   autonomous systems via\
    \ an Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) [2].\n"

- title: EGP Implementation Schedule
  contents:
  - "EGP Implementation Schedule\n   The factoring of the old set of smart gateways\
    \ into a number of\n   autonomous systems allows more flexibility for the development\
    \ and\n   testing of improved routing procedures.  Different autonomous systems\n\
    \   can adopt different routing procedures internally, as long as they\n   communicate\
    \ with other autonomous systems via the EGP.\n"
- title: The Transition Situation
  contents:
  - "The Transition Situation\n   The first step in the transition from the current\
    \ situation to the\n   future situation is the replacement of all dumb gateways\
    \ with\n   gateways that implement at least a subset of the EGP.\n      This subset\
    \ is called the \"Stub Exterior Gateway Protocol\", and is\n      described in\
    \ RFC-888 [1].\n   The second step is to factor the existing smart gateways into\n\
    \   autonomous systems.  The gateways programmed and maintained by\n   different\
    \ groups will become distinct autonomous systems.  As things\n   are, this will\
    \ result in one fairly large autonomous system and three\n   or four small autonomous\
    \ systems.  At this step the large autonomous\n   system will be referred to as\
    \ the \"core\" autonomous system.  All\n   other autonomous systems will be stubs\
    \ attached to this core via EGP.\n   The third step is to specify the full EGP\
    \ protocol, and to allow a\n   rich connectivity between co-equal autonomous systems.\n"
- title: Policy Statement
  contents:
  - "Policy Statement\n   After 1-Aug-84 there shall be no dumb gateways in the Internet.\n\
    \   Every gateway must be a member of some autonomous system.  Some\n   gateway\
    \ of each autonomous system must exchange routing information\n   with some gateway\
    \ of the core autonomous system using the Exterior\n   Gateway Protocol.\n"
- title: Implication
  contents:
  - "Implication\n   If you have a dumb gateway now, you should start doing something\n\
    \   today to get it upgraded to, or replaced by, an EGP gateway.\n"
- title: Help Available
  contents:
  - "Help Available\n   There may be a gateway you can use already developed by someone.\n\
    \   People at the following places are working on EGP gateways:  BBN,\n   MIT,\
    \ Linkabit, ISI, Honeywell, and Symbolics.  For more information\n   send a message\
    \ to Joyce Reynolds at mailbox \"JKReynolds@USC-ISIF\".\n   There are plans to\
    \ provide EGP functionality in Berkeley 4.2 Unix.\n"
