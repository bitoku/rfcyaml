  - "July 24, 1996\n   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the Internet Engineering\n\
    \   Steering Group (IESG), the bodies which oversee architecture and\n   standards\
    \ for the Internet, are concerned by the need for increased\n   protection of\
    \ international commercial transactions on the Internet,\n   and by the need to\
    \ offer all Internet users an adequate degree of\n   privacy.\n   Security mechanisms\
    \ being developed in the Internet Engineering Task\n   Force to meet these needs\
    \ require and depend on the international use\n   of adequate cryptographic technology.\
    \  Ready access to such\n   technology is therefore a key factor in the future\
    \ growth of the\n   Internet as a motor for international commerce and communication.\n\
    \   The IAB and IESG are therefore disturbed to note that various\n   governments\
    \ have actual or proposed policies on access to\n   cryptographic technology that\
    \ either:\n   (a) impose restrictions by implementing export controls; and/or\n\
    \   (b) restrict commercial and private users to weak and inadequate\n       mechanisms\
    \ such as short cryptographic keys; and/or\n   (c) mandate that private decryption\
    \ keys should be in the hands of\n       the government or of some other third\
    \ party; and/or\n   (d) prohibit the use of cryptology entirely, or permit it\
    \ only to\n       specially authorized organizations.\n   We believe that such\
    \ policies are against the interests of consumers\n   and the business community,\
    \ are largely irrelevant to issues of\n   military security, and provide only\
    \ a marginal or illusory benefit to\n   law enforcement agencies, as discussed\
    \ below.\n   The IAB and IESG would like to encourage policies that allow ready\n\
    \   access to uniform strong cryptographic technology for all Internet\n   users\
    \ in all countries.\n"
- title: 'The IAB and IESG claim:'
  contents:
  - "The IAB and IESG claim:\n   The Internet is becoming the predominant vehicle\
    \ for electronic\n   commerce and information exchange. It is essential that the\
    \ support\n   structure for these activities can be trusted.\n   Encryption is\
    \ not a secret technology monopolized by any one country,\n   such that export\
    \ controls can hope to contain its deployment. Any\n   hobbyist can program a\
    \ PC to do powerful encryption. Many algorithms\n   are well documented, some\
    \ with source code available in textbooks.\n   Export controls on encryption place\
    \ companies in that country at a\n   competitive disadvantage. Their competitors\
    \ from countries without\n   export restrictions can sell systems whose only design\
    \ constraint is\n   being secure, and easy to use.\n   Usage controls on encryption\
    \ will also place companies in that\n   country at a competitive disadvantage\
    \ because these companies cannot\n   securely and easily engage in electronic\
    \ commerce.\n   Escrow mechanisms inevitably weaken the security of the overall\n\
    \   cryptographic system, by creating new points of vulnerability that\n   can\
    \ and will be attacked.\n   Export controls and usage controls are slowing the\
    \ deployment of\n   security at the same time as the Internet is exponentially\
    \ increasing\n   in size and attackers are increasing in sophistication. This\
    \ puts\n   users in a dangerous position as they are forced to rely on insecure\n\
    \   electronic communication.\n"

- title: KEY SIZE
  contents:
  - "KEY SIZE\n   It is not acceptable to restrict the use or export of cryptosystems\n\
    \   based on their key size.  Systems that are breakable by one country\n   will\
    \ be breakable by others, possibly unfriendly ones.  Large\n   corporations and\
    \ even criminal enterprises have the resources to\n   break many cryptosystems.\
    \  Furthermore, conversations often need to\n   be protected for years to come;\
    \ as computers increase in speed, key\n   sizes that were once out of reach of\
    \ cryptanalysis will become\n   insecure.\n"
- title: PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE
  contents:
  - "PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE\n   Use of public key cryptography often requires the\
    \ existence of a\n   \"certification authority\".  That is, some third party must\
    \ sign a\n   string containing the user's identity and public key.  In turn, the\n\
    \   third party's key is often signed by a higher-level certification\n   authority.\n\
    \   Such a structure is legitimate and necessary.  Indeed, many\n   governments\
    \ will and should run their own CAs, if only to protect\n   citizens' transactions\
    \ with their governments.  But certification\n   authorities should not be confused\
    \ with escrow centers.  Escrow\n   centers are repositories for private keys,\
    \ while certification\n   authorities deal with public keys. Indeed, sound cryptographic\n\
    \   practice dictates that users never reveal their private keys to\n   anyone,\
    \ even the certification authority.\n"
- title: KEYS SHOULD NOT BE REVEALABLE
  contents:
  - "KEYS SHOULD NOT BE REVEALABLE\n   The security of a modern cryptosystem rests\
    \ entirely on the secrecy\n   of the keys.  Accordingly, it is a major principle\
    \ of system design\n   that to the extent possible, secret keys should never leave\
    \ their\n   user's secure environment.  Key escrow implies that keys must be\n\
    \   disclosed in some fashion, a flat-out contradiction of this\n   principle.\
    \  Any such disclosure weakens the total security of the\n   system.\n"
- title: DATA RECOVERY
  contents:
  - "DATA RECOVERY\n   Sometimes escrow systems are touted as being good for the customer\n\
    \   because they allow data recovery in the case of lost keys. However,\n   it\
    \ should be up to the customer to decide whether they would prefer\n   the more\
    \ secure system in which lost keys mean lost data, or one in\n   which keys are\
    \ escrowed to be recovered when necessary.  Similarly,\n   keys used only for\
    \ conversations (as opposed to file storage) need\n   never be escrowed.  And\
    \ a system in which the secret key is stored by\n   a government and not by the\
    \ data owner is certainly not practical for\n   data recovery.\n"
- title: SIGNATURE KEYS
  contents:
  - "SIGNATURE KEYS\n   Keys used for signatures and authentication must never be\
    \ escrowed.\n   Any third party with access to such keys could impersonate the\n\
    \   legitimate owner, creating new opportunities for fraud and deceit.\n   Indeed,\
    \ a user who wished to repudiate a transaction could claim that\n   his or her\
    \ escrowed key was used, putting the onus on that party.  If\n   a government\
    \ escrowed the keys, a defendant could claim that the\n   evidence had been forged\
    \ by the government, thereby making\n   prosecution much more difficult.  For\
    \ electronic commerce, non-\n   repudiation is one of the most important uses\
    \ for cryptography; and\n   non-repudiation depends on the assumption that only\
    \ the user has\n   access to the private key.\n"
- title: PROTECTION OF THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE
  contents:
  - "PROTECTION OF THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE\n   In some cases, it is technically\
    \ feasible to use cryptographic\n   operations that do not involve secrecy.  While\
    \ this may suffice in\n   some cases, much of the existing technical and commercial\n\
    \   infrastructure cannot be protected in this way.  For example,\n   conventional\
    \ passwords, credit card numbers, and the like must be\n   protected by strong\
    \ encryption, even though some day more\n   sophisticated techniques may replace\
    \ them.  Encryption can be added\n   on quite easily; wholesale changes to diverse\
    \ systems cannot.\n"
- title: CONFLICTING INTERNATIONAL POLICIES
  contents:
  - "CONFLICTING INTERNATIONAL POLICIES\n   Conflicting restrictions on encryption\
    \ often force an international\n   company to use a weak encryption system, in\
    \ order to satisfy legal\n   requirements in two or more different countries.\
    \  Ironically, in such\n   cases either nation might consider the other an adversary\
    \ against\n   whom commercial enterprises should use strong cryptography.  Clearly,\n\
    \   key escrow is not a suitable compromise, since neither country would\n   want\
    \ to disclose keys to the other.\n"
- title: MULTIPLE ENCRYPTION
  contents:
  - "MULTIPLE ENCRYPTION\n   Even if escrowed encryption schemes are used, there is\
    \ nothing to\n   prevent someone from using another encryption scheme first.\n\
    \   Certainly, any serious malefactors would do this; the outer\n   encryption\
    \ layer, which would use an escrowed scheme, would be used\n   to divert suspicion.\n"
- title: ESCROW OF PRIVATE KEYS WON'T NECESSARILY ALLOW DATA DECRYPTION
  contents:
  - "ESCROW OF PRIVATE KEYS WON'T NECESSARILY ALLOW DATA DECRYPTION\n   A major threat\
    \ to users of cryptographic systems is the theft of\n   long-term keys (perhaps\
    \ by a hacker), either before or after a\n   sensitive conversation.  To counter\
    \ this threat, schemes with\n   \"perfect forward secrecy\" are often employed.\
    \  If PFS is used, the\n   attacker must be in control of the machine during the\
    \ actual\n   conversation.  But PFS is generally incompatible with schemes\n \
    \  involving escrow of private keys.  (This is an oversimplification,\n   but\
    \ a full analysis would be too lengthy for this document.)\n"
- title: CONCLUSIONS
  contents:
  - "CONCLUSIONS\n   As more and more companies connect to the Internet, and as more\
    \ and\n   more commerce takes place there, security is becoming more and more\n\
    \   critical.  Cryptography is the most powerful single tool that users\n   can\
    \ use to secure the Internet. Knowingly making that tool weaker\n   threatens\
    \ their ability to do so, and has no proven benefit.\n"
