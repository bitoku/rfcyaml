    \   forward error correction allows RTP participants to improve loss\n   resiliency\

  - "1 Introduction\n   The RTP payload format for generic forward error correction\
    \ [1]\n   allows RTP participants to improve loss resiliency through the use of\n\
    \   traditional parity-based channel codes.  This payload format requires\n  \
    \ four new MIME types, audio/parityfec, video/parityfec,\n   text/paritfyfec and\
    \ application/parityfec.  RFC 2048 [2] defines\n   procedures for registration\
    \ of new MIME types within the IETF tree.\n   Furthermore, the Audio/Video Transport\
    \ working group has defined\n   additional procedures that must be followed when\
    \ registering RTP\n   payload formats [3].  This document serves as the MIME type\n\
    \   registration for those formats based on those procedures.\n"
