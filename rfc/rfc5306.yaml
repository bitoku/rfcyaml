  - "1.  Overview\n   The Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing\n\
    \   protocol [RFC1195] [ISO10589] is a link state intra-domain routing\n   protocol.\
    \  Normally, when an IS-IS router is restarted, temporary\n   disruption of routing\
    \ occurs due to events in both the restarting\n   router and the neighbors of\
    \ the restarting router.\n   The router that has been restarted computes its own\
    \ routes before\n   achieving database synchronization with its neighbors.  The\
    \ results\n   of this computation are likely to be non-convergent with the routes\n\
    \   computed by other routers in the area/domain.\n   Neighbors of the restarting\
    \ router detect the restart event and cycle\n   their adjacencies with the restarting\
    \ router through the down state.\n   The cycling of the adjacency state causes\
    \ the neighbors to regenerate\n   their LSPs describing the adjacency concerned.\
    \  This in turn causes a\n   temporary disruption of routes passing through the\
    \ restarting router.\n   In certain scenarios, the temporary disruption of the\
    \ routes is\n   highly undesirable.  This document describes mechanisms to avoid\
    \ or\n   minimize the disruption due to both of these causes.\n   When an adjacency\
    \ is reinitialized as a result of a neighbor\n   restarting, a router does three\
    \ things:\n   1.  It causes its own LSP(s) to be regenerated, thus triggering\
    \ SPF\n       runs throughout the area (or in the case of Level 2, throughout\n\
    \       the domain).\n   2.  It sets SRMflags on its own LSP database on the adjacency\n\
    \       concerned.\n   3.  In the case of a Point-to-Point link, it transmits\
    \ a complete set\n       of Complete Sequence Number PDUs (CSNPs), over the adjacency.\n\
    \   In the case of a restarting router process, the first of these is\n   highly\
    \ undesirable, but the second is essential in order to ensure\n   synchronization\
    \ of the LSP database.\n   The third action above minimizes the number of LSPs\
    \ that must be\n   exchanged and, if made reliable, provides a means of determining\
    \ when\n   the LSP databases of the neighboring routers have been synchronized.\n\
    \   This is desirable whether or not the router is being restarted (so\n   that\
    \ the overload bit can be cleared in the router's own LSP, for\n   example).\n\
    \   This document describes a mechanism for a restarting router to signal\n  \
    \ that it is restarting to its neighbors, and allow them to reestablish\n   their\
    \ adjacencies without cycling through the down state, while still\n   correctly\
    \ initiating database synchronization.\n   This document additionally describes\
    \ a mechanism for a restarting\n   router to determine when it has achieved LSP\
    \ database synchronization\n   with its neighbors and a mechanism to optimize\
    \ LSP database\n   synchronization and minimize transient routing disruption when\
    \ a\n   router starts.\n   It is assumed that the three-way handshake [RFC5303]\
    \ is being used on\n   Point-to-Point circuits.\n"

- title: 3.2.1.  Use of RR and RA Bits
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Use of RR and RA Bits\n   The RR bit is used by a (re)starting router\
    \ to signal to its\n   neighbors that a (re)start is in progress, that an existing\
    \ adjacency\n   SHOULD be maintained even under circumstances when the normal\n\
    \   operation of the adjacency state machine would require the adjacency\n   to\
    \ be reinitialized, to request a set of CSNPs, and to request\n   setting of the\
    \ SRMflags.\n   The RA bit is sent by the neighbor of a (re)starting router to\n\
    \   acknowledge the receipt of a restart TLV with the RR bit set.\n   When the\
    \ neighbor of a (re)starting router receives an IIH with the\n   restart TLV having\
    \ the RR bit set, if there exists on this interface\n   an adjacency in state\
    \ \"UP\" with the same System ID, and in the case\n   of a LAN circuit, with the\
    \ same source LAN address, then,\n   irrespective of the other contents of the\
    \ \"Intermediate System\n   Neighbors\" option (LAN circuits) or the \"Point-to-Point\
    \ Three-Way\n   Adjacency\" option (Point-to-Point circuits):\n   a.  the state\
    \ of the adjacency is not changed.  If this is the first\n       IIH with the\
    \ RR bit set that this system has received associated\n       with this adjacency,\
    \ then the adjacency is marked as being in\n       \"Restart mode\" and the adjacency\
    \ holding time is refreshed --\n       otherwise, the holding time is not refreshed.\
    \  The \"remaining\n       time\" transmitted according to (b) below MUST reflect\
    \ the actual\n       time after which the adjacency will now expire.  Receipt\
    \ of a\n       normal IIH with the RR bit reset will clear the \"Restart mode\"\
    \n       state.  This procedure allows the restarting router to cause the\n  \
    \     neighbor to maintain the adjacency long enough for restart to\n       successfully\
    \ complete, while also preventing repetitive restarts\n       from maintaining\
    \ an adjacency indefinitely.  Whether or not an\n       adjacency is marked as\
    \ being in \"Restart mode\" has no effect on\n       adjacency state transitions.\n\
    \   b.  immediately (i.e., without waiting for any currently running\n       timer\
    \ interval to expire, but with a small random delay of a few\n       tens of milliseconds\
    \ on LANs to avoid \"storms\") transmit over the\n       corresponding interface\
    \ an IIH including the restart TLV with the\n       RR bit clear and the RA bit\
    \ set, in the case of Point-to-Point\n       adjacencies having updated the \"\
    Point-to-Point Three-Way\n       Adjacency\" option to reflect any new values\
    \ received from the\n       (re)starting router.  (This allows a restarting router\
    \ to quickly\n       acquire the correct information to place in its hellos.)\
    \  The\n       \"Remaining Time\" MUST be set to the current time (in seconds)\n\
    \       before the holding timer on this adjacency is due to expire.  If\n   \
    \    the corresponding interface is a LAN interface, then the\n       Restarting\
    \ Neighbor System ID SHOULD be set to the System ID of\n       the router from\
    \ which the IIH with the RR bit set was received.\n       This is required to\
    \ correctly associate the acknowledgement and\n       holding time in the case\
    \ where multiple systems on a LAN restart\n       at approximately the same time.\
    \  This IIH SHOULD be transmitted\n       before any LSPs or SNPs are transmitted\
    \ as a result of the\n       receipt of the original IIH.\n   c.  if the corresponding\
    \ interface is a Point-to-Point interface, or\n       if the receiving router\
    \ has the highest LnRouterPriority (with\n       the highest source MAC (Media\
    \ Access Control) address breaking\n       ties) among those routers to which\
    \ the receiving router has an\n       adjacency in state \"UP\" on this interface\
    \ whose IIHs contain the\n       restart TLV, excluding adjacencies to all routers\
    \ which are\n       considered in \"Restart mode\" (note the actual DIS is NOT\
    \ changed\n       by this process), initiate the transmission over the\n     \
    \  corresponding interface of a complete set of CSNPs, and set\n       SRMflags\
    \ on the corresponding interface for all LSPs in the local\n       LSP database.\n\
    \   Otherwise (i.e., if there was no adjacency in the \"UP\" state to the\n  \
    \ System ID in question), process the IIH as normal by reinitializing\n   the\
    \ adjacency and setting the RA bit in the returned IIH.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  Use of the SA Bit
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Use of the SA Bit\n   The SA bit is used by a starting router to request\
    \ that its neighbor\n   suppress advertisement of the adjacency to the starting\
    \ router in the\n   neighbor's LSPs.\n   A router that is starting has no maintained\
    \ forwarding function\n   state.  This may or may not be the first time the router\
    \ has started.\n   If this is not the first time the router has started, copies\
    \ of LSPs\n   generated by this router in its previous incarnation may exist in\
    \ the\n   LSP databases of other routers in the network.  These copies are\n \
    \  likely to appear \"newer\" than LSPs initially generated by the\n   starting\
    \ router due to the reinitialization of LSP fragment sequence\n   numbers by the\
    \ starting router.  This may cause temporary blackholes\n   to occur until the\
    \ normal operation of the update process causes the\n   starting router to regenerate\
    \ and flood copies of its own LSPs with\n   higher sequence numbers.  The temporary\
    \ blackholes can be avoided if\n   the starting router's neighbors suppress advertising\
    \ an adjacency to\n   the starting router until the starting router has been able\
    \ to\n   propagate newer versions of LSPs generated by previous incarnations.\n\
    \   When a router receives an IIH with the restart TLV having the SA bit\n   set,\
    \ if there exists on this interface an adjacency in state \"UP\"\n   with the\
    \ same System ID, and in the case of a LAN circuit, with the\n   same source LAN\
    \ address, then the router MUST suppress advertisement\n   of the adjacency to\
    \ the neighbor in its own LSPs.  Until an IIH with\n   the SA bit clear has been\
    \ received, the neighbor advertisement MUST\n   continue to be suppressed.  If\
    \ the adjacency transitions to the \"UP\"\n   state, the new adjacency MUST NOT\
    \ be advertised until an IIH with the\n   SA bit clear has been received.\n  \
    \ Note that a router that suppresses advertisement of an adjacency MUST\n   NOT\
    \ use this adjacency when performing its SPF calculation.  In\n   particular,\
    \ if an implementation follows the example guidelines\n   presented in [ISO10589],\
    \ Annex C.2.5, Step 0:b) \"pre-load TENT with\n   the local adjacency database\"\
    , the suppressed adjacency MUST NOT be\n   loaded into TENT.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Adjacency (Re)Acquisition
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Adjacency (Re)Acquisition\n   Adjacency (re)acquisition is the first step\
    \ in (re)initialization.\n   Restarting and starting routers will make use of\
    \ the RR bit in the\n   restart TLV, though each will use it at different stages\
    \ of the\n   (re)start procedure.\n"
- title: 3.3.1.  Adjacency Reacquisition during Restart
  contents:
  - "3.3.1.  Adjacency Reacquisition during Restart\n   The restarting router explicitly\
    \ notifies its neighbor that the\n   adjacency is being reacquired, and hence\
    \ that it SHOULD NOT\n   reinitialize the adjacency.  This is achieved by setting\
    \ the RR bit\n   in the restart TLV.  When the neighbor of a restarting router\n\
    \   receives an IIH with the restart TLV having the RR bit set, if there\n   exists\
    \ on this interface an adjacency in state \"UP\" with the same\n   System ID,\
    \ and in the case of a LAN circuit, with the same source LAN\n   address, then\
    \ the procedures described in Section 3.2.1 are followed.\n   A router that does\
    \ not support the restart capability will ignore the\n   restart TLV and reinitialize\
    \ the adjacency as normal, returning an\n   IIH without the restart TLV.\n   On\
    \ restarting, a router initializes the timer T3, starts the timer T2\n   for each\
    \ LSPDB, and for each interface (and in the case of a LAN\n   circuit, for each\
    \ level) starts the timer T1 and transmits an IIH\n   containing the restart TLV\
    \ with the RR bit set.\n   On a Point-to-Point circuit, the restarting router\
    \ SHOULD set the\n   \"Adjacency Three-Way State\" to \"Init\", because the receipt\
    \ of the\n   acknowledging IIH (with RA set) MUST cause the adjacency to enter\
    \ the\n   \"UP\" state immediately.\n   On a LAN circuit, the LAN-ID assigned\
    \ to the circuit SHOULD be the\n   same as that used prior to the restart.  In\
    \ particular, for any\n   circuits for which the restarting router was previously\
    \ DIS, the use\n   of a different LAN-ID would necessitate the generation of a\
    \ new set\n   of pseudonode LSPs, and corresponding changes in all the LSPs\n\
    \   referencing them from other routers on the LAN.  By preserving the\n   LAN-ID\
    \ across the restart, this churn can be prevented.  To enable a\n   restarting\
    \ router to learn the LAN-ID used prior to restart, the\n   LAN-ID specified in\
    \ an IIH with RR set MUST be ignored.\n   Transmission of \"normal\" IIHs is inhibited\
    \ until the conditions\n   described below are met (in order to avoid causing\
    \ an unnecessary\n   adjacency initialization).  Upon expiry of the timer T1,\
    \ it is\n   restarted and the IIH is retransmitted as above.\n   When a restarting\
    \ router receives an IIH a local adjacency is\n   established as usual, and if\
    \ the IIH contains a restart TLV with the\n   RA bit set (and on LAN circuits\
    \ with a Restart Neighbor System ID\n   that matches that of the local system),\
    \ the receipt of the\n   acknowledgement over that interface is noted.  When the\
    \ RA bit is set\n   and the state of the remote adjacency is \"UP\", then the\
    \ timer T3 is\n   set to the minimum of its current value and the value of the\n\
    \   \"Remaining Time\" field in the received IIH.\n   On a Point-to-Point link,\
    \ receipt of an IIH not containing the\n   restart TLV is also treated as an acknowledgement,\
    \ since it indicates\n   that the neighbor is not restart capable.  However, since\
    \ no CSNP is\n   guaranteed to be received over this interface, the timer T1 is\n\
    \   cancelled immediately without waiting for a complete set of CSNPs.\n   Synchronization\
    \ may therefore be deemed complete even though there\n   are some LSPs which are\
    \ held (only) by this neighbor (see\n   Section 3.4).  In this case, we also want\
    \ to be certain that the\n   neighbor will reinitialize the adjacency in order\
    \ to guarantee that\n   the SRMflags have been set on its database, thus ensuring\
    \ eventual\n   LSPDB synchronization.  This is guaranteed to happen except in\
    \ the\n   case where the Adjacency Three-Way State in the received IIH is \"UP\"\
    \n   and the Neighbor Extended Local Circuit ID matches the extended local\n \
    \  circuit ID assigned by the restarting router.  In this case, the\n   restarting\
    \ router MUST force the adjacency to reinitialize by setting\n   the local Adjacency\
    \ Three-Way State to \"DOWN\" and sending a normal\n   IIH.\n   In the case of\
    \ a LAN interface, receipt of an IIH not containing the\n   restart TLV is unremarkable\
    \ since synchronization can still occur so\n   long as at least one of the non-restarting\
    \ neighboring routers on the\n   LAN supports restart.  Therefore, T1 continues\
    \ to run in this case.\n   If none of the neighbors on the LAN are restart capable,\
    \ T1 will\n   eventually expire after the locally defined number of retries.\n\

- title: 3.3.2.  Adjacency Acquisition during Start
  contents:
  - "3.3.2.  Adjacency Acquisition during Start\n   The starting router wants to ensure\
    \ that in the event that a\n   neighboring router has an adjacency to the starting\
    \ router in the\n   \"UP\" state (from a previous incarnation of the starting\
    \ router), this\n   adjacency is reinitialized.  The starting router also wants\n\
    \   neighboring routers to suppress advertisement of an adjacency to the\n   starting\
    \ router until LSP database synchronization is achieved.  This\n   is achieved\
    \ by sending IIHs with the RR bit clear and the SA bit set\n   in the restart\
    \ TLV.  The RR bit remains clear and the SA bit remains\n   set in subsequent\
    \ transmissions of IIHs until the adjacency has\n   reached the \"UP\" state and\
    \ the initial T1 timer interval (see below)\n   has expired.\n   Receipt of an\
    \ IIH with the RR bit clear will result in the\n   neighboring router utilizing\
    \ normal operation of the adjacency state\n   machine.  This will ensure that\
    \ any old adjacency on the neighboring\n   router will be reinitialized.\n   Upon\
    \ receipt of an IIH with the SA bit set, the behavior described in\n   Section\
    \ 3.2.2 is followed.\n   Upon starting, a router starts timer T2 for each LSPDB.\n\
    \   For each interface (and in the case of a LAN circuit, for each\n   level),\
    \ when an adjacency reaches the \"UP\" state, the starting router\n   starts a\
    \ timer T1 and transmits an IIH containing the restart TLV\n   with the RR bit\
    \ clear and SA bit set.  Upon expiry of the timer T1,\n   it is restarted and\
    \ the IIH is retransmitted with both RR and SA bits\n   set (only the RR bit has\
    \ changed state from earlier IIHs).\n   Upon receipt of an IIH with the RR bit\
    \ set (regardless of whether or\n   not the SA bit is set), the behavior described\
    \ in Section 3.2.1 is\n   followed.\n   When an IIH is received by the starting\
    \ router and the IIH contains a\n   restart TLV with the RA bit set (and on LAN\
    \ circuits with a Restart\n   Neighbor System ID that matches that of the local\
    \ system), the\n   receipt of the acknowledgement over that interface is noted.\n\
    \   On a Point-to-Point link, receipt of an IIH not containing the\n   restart\
    \ TLV is also treated as an acknowledgement, since it indicates\n   that the neighbor\
    \ is not restart capable.  Since the neighbor will\n   have reinitialized the\
    \ adjacency, this guarantees that SRMflags have\n   been set on its database,\
    \ thus ensuring eventual LSPDB\n   synchronization.  However, since no CSNP is\
    \ guaranteed to be received\n   over this interface, the timer T1 is cancelled\
    \ immediately without\n   waiting for a complete set of CSNPs.  Synchronization\
    \ may therefore\n   be deemed complete even though there are some LSPs that are\
    \ held\n   (only) by this neighbor (see Section 3.4).\n   In the case of a LAN\
    \ interface, receipt of an IIH not containing the\n   restart TLV is unremarkable\
    \ since synchronization can still occur so\n   long as at least one of the non-restarting\
    \ neighboring routers on the\n   LAN supports restart.  Therefore, T1 continues\
    \ to run in this case.\n   If none of the neighbors on the LAN are restart capable,\
    \ T1 will\n   eventually expire after the locally defined number of retries. \
    \ The\n   usual operation of the update process will ensure that\n   synchronization\
    \ is eventually achieved.\n   When BOTH a complete set of CSNPs (for each active\
    \ level, in the case\n   of a Point-to-Point circuit) and an acknowledgement have\
    \ been\n   received over the interface, the timer T1 is cancelled.  Subsequent\n\
    \   IIHs sent by the starting router have the RR and RA bits clear and\n   the\
    \ SA bit set in the restart TLV.\n   Timer T1 is cancelled after some predetermined\
    \ number of expirations\n   (which MAY be 1).\n   When the T2 timer(s) are cancelled\
    \ or expire, transmission of\n   \"normal\" IIHs (with RR, RA, and SA bits clear)\
    \ will begin.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.3.3.  Multiple Levels\n   A router that is operating as both a Level 1 and\
    \ a Level 2 router on\n   a particular interface MUST perform the above operations\

    \ 1 and Level 2\n   IIHs and perform the CSNP synchronizations independently for\
    \ each\n   level.\n   On a Point-to-Point interface, only a single IIH (indicating\

    \ independently for each level.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Database Synchronization
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Database Synchronization\n   When a router is started or restarted, it\
    \ can expect to receive a\n   complete set of CSNPs over each interface.  The\
    \ arrival of the\n   CSNP(s) is now guaranteed, since an IIH with the RR bit set\
    \ will be\n   retransmitted until the CSNP(s) are correctly received.\n   The\
    \ CSNPs describe the set of LSPs that are currently held by each\n   neighbor.\
    \  Synchronization will be complete when all these LSPs have\n   been received.\n\
    \   When (re)starting, a router starts an instance of timer T2 for each\n   LSPDB\
    \ as described in Section 3.3.1 or Section 3.3.2.  In addition to\n   normal processing\
    \ of the CSNPs, the set of LSPIDs contained in the\n   first complete set of CSNPs\
    \ received over each interface is recorded,\n   together with their remaining\
    \ lifetime.  In the case of a LAN\n   interface, a complete set of CSNPs MUST\
    \ consist of CSNPs received\n   from neighbors that are not restarting.  If there\
    \ are multiple\n   interfaces on the (re)starting router, the recorded set of\
    \ LSPIDs is\n   the union of those received over each interface.  LSPs with a\n\
    \   remaining lifetime of zero are NOT so recorded.\n   As LSPs are received (by\
    \ the normal operation of the update process)\n   over any interface, the corresponding\
    \ LSPID entry is removed (it is\n   also removed if an LSP arrives before the\
    \ CSNP containing the\n   reference).  When an LSPID has been held in the list\
    \ for its\n   indicated remaining lifetime, it is removed from the list.  When\
    \ the\n   list of LSPIDs is empty and the timer T1 has been cancelled for all\n\
    \   the interfaces that have an adjacency at this level, the timer T2 is\n   cancelled.\n\

    \ were present in the neighbors' databases at the time of\n   (re)starting.  LSPs\
    \ that arrived in a neighbor's database after the\n   time of (re)starting may\
    \ or may not be present, but the normal\n   operation of the update process will\
    \ guarantee that they will\n   eventually be received.  At this point, the local\
    \ database is deemed\n   to be \"synchronized\".\n   Since LSPs mentioned in the\
    \ CSNP(s) with a zero remaining lifetime\n   are not recorded, and those with\
    \ a short remaining lifetime are\n   deleted from the list when the lifetime expires,\

- title: 3.4.1.1.  Restarting
  contents:
  - "3.4.1.1.  Restarting\n   In order to avoid causing unnecessary routing churn\
    \ in other routers,\n   it is highly desirable that the router's own LSPs generated\
    \ by the\n   restarting system are the same as those previously present in the\n\
    \   network (assuming no other changes have taken place).  It is\n   important\
    \ therefore not to regenerate and flood the LSPs until all\n   the adjacencies\
    \ have been re-established and any information required\n   for propagation into\
    \ the local LSPs is fully available.  Ideally, the\n   information is loaded into\
    \ the LSPs in a deterministic way, such that\n   the same information occurs in\
    \ the same place in the same LSP (and\n   hence the LSPs are identical to their\
    \ previous versions).  If this\n   can be achieved, the new versions may not even\
    \ cause SPF to be run in\n   other systems.  However, provided the same information\
    \ is included in\n   the set of LSPs (albeit in a different order, and possibly\
    \ different\n   LSPs), the result of running the SPF will be the same and will\
    \ not\n   cause churn to the forwarding tables.\n   In the case of a restarting\
    \ router, none of the router's own LSPs are\n   transmitted, nor are the router's\
    \ own forwarding tables updated while\n   the timer T3 is running.\n   Redistribution\
    \ of inter-level information MUST be regenerated before\n   this router's LSP\
    \ is flooded to other nodes.  Therefore, the Level-n\n   non-pseudonode LSP(s)\
    \ MUST NOT be flooded until the other level's T2\n   timer has expired and its\
    \ SPF has been run.  This ensures that any\n   inter-level information that is\
    \ to be propagated can be included in\n   the Level-n LSP(s).\n   During this\
    \ period, if one of the router's own (including\n   pseudonodes) LSPs is received,\
    \ which the local router does not\n   currently have in its own database, it is\
    \ NOT purged.  Under normal\n   operation, such an LSP would be purged, since\
    \ the LSP clearly should\n   not be present in the global LSP database.  However,\
    \ in the present\n   circumstances, this would be highly undesirable, because\
    \ it could\n   cause premature removal of a router's own LSP -- and hence churn\
    \ in\n   remote routers.  Even if the local system has one or more of the\n  \
    \ router's own LSPs (which it has generated, but not yet transmitted),\n   it\
    \ is still not valid to compare the received LSP against this set,\n   since it\
    \ may be that as a result of propagation between Level 1 and\n   Level 2 (or vice\
    \ versa), a further router's own LSP will need to be\n   generated when the LSP\
    \ databases have synchronized.\n   During this period, a restarting router SHOULD\
    \ send CSNPs as it\n   normally would.  Information about the router's own LSPs\
    \ MAY be\n   included, but if it is included it MUST be based on LSPs that have\n\
    \   been received, not on versions that have been generated (but not yet\n   transmitted).\
    \  This restriction is necessary to prevent premature\n   removal of an LSP from\
    \ the global LSP database.\n   When the timer T2 expires or is cancelled indicating\
    \ that\n   synchronization for that level is complete, the SPF for that level\
    \ is\n   run in order to derive any information that is required to be\n   propagated\
    \ to another level, but the forwarding tables are not yet\n   updated.\n   Once\
    \ the other level's SPF has run and any inter-level propagation\n   has been resolved,\
    \ the router's own LSPs can be generated and\n   flooded.  Any own LSPs that were\
    \ previously ignored, but that are not\n   part of the current set of own LSPs\
    \ (including pseudonodes), MUST\n   then be purged.  Note that it is possible\
    \ that a Designated Router\n   change may have taken place, and consequently the\
    \ router SHOULD purge\n   those pseudonode LSPs that it previously owned, but\
    \ that are now no\n   longer part of its set of pseudonode LSPs.\n   When all\
    \ the T2 timers have expired or been cancelled, the timer T3\n   is cancelled\
    \ and the local forwarding tables are updated.\n   If the timer T3 expires before\
    \ all the T2 timers have expired or been\n   cancelled, this indicates that the\
    \ synchronization process is taking\n   longer than the minimum holding time of\
    \ the neighbors.  The router's\n   own LSP(s) for levels that have not yet completed\
    \ their first SPF\n   computation are then flooded with the overload bit set to\
    \ indicate\n   that the router's LSPDB is not yet synchronized (and therefore\
    \ other\n   routers MUST NOT compute routes through this router).  Normal\n  \
    \ operation of the update process resumes, and the local forwarding\n   tables\
    \ are updated.  In order to prevent the neighbor's adjacencies\n   from expiring,\
    \ IIHs with the normal interface value for the holding\n   time are transmitted\
    \ over all interfaces with neither RR nor RA set\n   in the restart TLV.  This\
    \ will cause the neighbors to refresh their\n   adjacencies.  The router's own\
    \ LSP(s) will continue to have the\n   overload bit set until timer T2 has expired\
    \ or been cancelled.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.4.1.2.  Starting\n   In the case of a starting router, as soon as each adjacency\
    \ is\n   established, and before any CSNP exchanges, the router's own zeroth\n\

- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Any new security issues raised by the procedures\
    \ in this document\n   depend upon the ability of an attacker to inject a false\
    \ but\n   apparently valid IIH, the ease/difficulty of which has not been\n  \
    \ altered.\n   If the RR bit is set in a false IIH, neighbors who receive such\
    \ an\n   IIH will continue to maintain an existing adjacency in the \"UP\" state\n\
    \   and may (re)send a complete set of CSNPs.  While the latter action is\n  \
    \ wasteful, neither action causes any disruption in correct protocol\n   operation.\n\
    \   If the RA bit is set in a false IIH, a (re)starting router that\n   receives\
    \ such an IIH may falsely believe that there is a neighbor on\n   the corresponding\
    \ interface that supports the procedures described in\n   this document.  In the\
    \ absence of receipt of a complete set of CSNPs\n   on that interface, this could\
    \ delay the completion of (re)start\n   procedures by requiring the timer T1 to\
    \ time out the locally defined\n   maximum number of retries.  This behavior is\
    \ the same as would occur\n   on a LAN where none of the (re)starting router's\
    \ neighbors support\n   the procedures in this document and is covered in Sections\
    \ 3.3.1 and\n   3.3.2.\n   If an SA bit is set in a false IIH, this could cause\
    \ suppression of\n   the advertisement of an IS neighbor, which could either continue\
    \ for\n   an indefinite period or occur intermittently with the result being a\n\
    \   possible loss of reachability to some destinations in the network\n   and/or\
    \ increased frequency of LSP flooding and SPF calculation.\n   The possibility\
    \ of IS-IS PDU spoofing can be reduced by the use of\n   authentication as described\
    \ in [RFC1195] and [ISO10589], and\n   especially the use of cryptographic authentication\
    \ as described in\n   [RFC5304].\n"
