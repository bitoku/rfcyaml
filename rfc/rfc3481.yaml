- title: 1. Introduction

  - "1. Introduction\n   The second generation cellular systems are commonly referred\
    \ to as\n   2G.  The 2G phase began in the 1990s when digital voice encoding had\n\
    \   replaced analog systems (1G).  2G systems are based on various radio\n   technologies\
    \ including frequency-, code- and time- division multiple\n   access.  Examples\
    \ of 2G systems include GSM (Europe), PDC (Japan),\n   and IS-95 (USA).  Data\
    \ links provided by 2G systems are mostly\n   circuit-switched and have transmission\
    \ speeds of 10-20 kbps uplink\n   and downlink.  Demand for higher data rates,\
    \ instant availability and\n   data volume-based charging, as well as lack of\
    \ radio spectrum\n   allocated for 2G led to the introduction of 2.5G (for example,\
    \ GPRS\n   and PDC-P) and 3G (for example, Wideband CDMA and cdma2000) systems.\n\
    \   Radio technology for both Wideband CDMA (W-CDMA) (adopted, for\n   example,\
    \ in Europe, Japan, etc) and cdma2000 (adopted, for example,\n   in US, South\
    \ Korea, etc) is based on code division multiple access\n   allowing for higher\
    \ data rates and more efficient spectrum\n   utilization than 2G systems.  3G\
    \ systems provide both packet-switched\n   and circuit-switched connectivity in\
    \ order to address the quality of\n   service requirements of conversational,\
    \ interactive, streaming, and\n   bulk transfer applications.  The transition\
    \ to 3G is expected to be a\n   gradual process.  Initially, 3G will be deployed\
    \ to introduce high\n   capacity and high speed access in densely populated areas.\
    \  Mobile\n   users with multimode terminals will be able to utilize existing\n\
    \   coverage of 2.5G systems on the rest of territory.\n   Much development and\
    \ deployment activity has centered around 2.5G and\n   3G technologies.  Along\
    \ with objectives like increased capacity for\n   voice channels, a primary motivation\
    \ for these is data communication,\n   and, in particular, Internet access.  Accordingly,\
    \ key issues are TCP\n   performance and the several techniques which can be applied\
    \ to\n   optimize it over different wireless environments [19].\n   This document\
    \ proposes a profile of such techniques, (particularly\n   effective for use with\
    \ 2.5G and 3G wireless networks).  The\n   configuration options in this document\
    \ are commonly found in modern\n   TCP stacks, and are widely available IETF standards-track\
    \ mechanisms\n   that the community has judged to be safe on the general Internet\n\
    \   (that is, even in predominantly non-wireless scenarios).\n   Furthermore,\
    \ this document makes one set of recommendations that\n   covers both 2.5G and\
    \ 3G networks.  Since both generations of wireless\n   technologies exhibit similar\
    \ challenges to TCP performance (see\n   Section 2), one common set is warranted.\n\
    \   Two example applications of the recommendations in this document are:\n  \
    \ o  The WAP Forum [25] (part of the Open Mobile Alliance [26] as of\n      June\
    \ 2002) is an industry association that has developed standards\n      for wireless\
    \ information and telephony services on digital mobile\n      phones.  In order\
    \ to address WAP functionality for higher speed\n      networks such as 2.5G and\
    \ 3G networks, and to aim at convergence\n      with Internet standards, the WAP\
    \ Forum thoroughly revised its\n      specifications.  The resultant version 2.0\
    \ [31] adopts TCP as its\n      transport protocol, and recommends TCP optimization\
    \ mechanisms\n      closely aligned with those described in this document.\n \
    \  o  I-mode [33] is a wireless Internet service deployed on handsets in\n   \
    \   Japan.  The newer version of i-mode runs on FOMA [34], an\n      implementation\
    \ of W-CDMA.  I-mode over FOMA deploys the profile of\n      TCP described in\
    \ this document.\n   This document is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews\
    \ the link\n   layer characteristics of 2.5G/3G networks; Section 3 gives a brief\n\
    \   overview of some representative 2.5G/3G technologies like W-CDMA,\n   cdma2000\
    \ and GPRS; Section 4 recommends mechanisms and configuration\n   options for\
    \ TCP implementations used in 2.5G/3G networks, including a\n   summary in chart\
    \ form at the end of the section; finally, Section 5\n   discusses some open issues.\n"
- title: 2. 2.5G and 3G Link Characteristics
  contents:
  - "2. 2.5G and 3G Link Characteristics\n   Link layer characteristics of 2.5G/3G\
    \ networks have significant\n   effects on TCP performance.  In this section we\
    \ present various\n   aspects of link characteristics unique to the 2.5G/3G networks.\n"
- title: 2.1 Latency
  contents:
  - "2.1 Latency\n   The latency of 2.5G/3G links is high mostly due to the extensive\n\
    \   processing required at the physical layer of those networks, e.g.,\n   for\
    \ FEC and interleaving, and due to transmission delays in the radio\n   access\
    \ network [58] (including link-level retransmissions).  A\n   typical RTT varies\
    \ between a few hundred milliseconds and one second.\n   The associated radio\
    \ channels suffer from difficult propagation\n   environments.  Hence, powerful\
    \ but complex physical layer techniques\n   need to be applied to provide high\
    \ capacity in a wide coverage area\n   in a resource efficient way.  Hopefully,\
    \ rapid improvements in all\n   areas of wireless networks ranging from radio\
    \ layer techniques over\n   signal processing to system architecture will ultimately\
    \ also lead to\n   reduced delays in 3G wireless systems.\n"
- title: 2.2 Data Rates
  contents:
  - "2.2 Data Rates\n   The main incentives for transition from 2G to 2.5G to 3G are\
    \ the\n   increase in voice capacity and in data rates for the users.  2.5G\n\
    \   systems have data rates of 10-20 kbps in uplink and 10-40 kbps in\n   downlink.\
    \  Initial 3G systems are expected to have bit rates around\n   64 kbps in uplink\
    \ and 384 kbps in downlink.  Considering the\n   resulting bandwidth-delay product\
    \ (BDP) of around 1-5 KB for 2.5G and\n   8-50 KB for 3G, 2.5G links can be considered\
    \ LTNs (Long Thin Networks\n   [19]), and 3G links approach LFNs (Long Fat Networks\
    \ [2], as\n   exemplified by some satellite networks [48]).  Accordingly,\n  \
    \ interested readers might find related and potentially relevant issues\n   discussed\
    \ in RFC 2488 [49].  For good TCP performance both LFNs and\n   LTNs require maintaining\
    \ a large enough window of outstanding data.\n   For LFNs, utilizing the available\
    \ network bandwidth is of particular\n   concern.   LTNs need a sufficiently large\
    \ window for efficient loss\n   recovery.  In particular, the fast retransmit\
    \ algorithm cannot be\n   triggered if the window is less than four segments.\
    \  This leads to a\n   lengthy recovery through retransmission timeouts.  The\
    \ Limited\n   Transmit algorithm RFC 3042 [10] helps avoid the deleterious effects\n\
    \   of timeouts on connections with small windows.  Nevertheless, making\n   full\
    \ use of the SACK RFC 2018 [3] information for loss recovery in\n   both LFNs\
    \ and LTNs may require twice the window otherwise sufficient\n   to utilize the\
    \ available bandwidth.\n   This document recommends only standard mechanisms suitable\
    \ both for\n   LTNs and LFNs, and to any network in general.  However, experimental\n\
    \   mechanisms suggested in Section 5 can be targeted either for LTNs\n   [19]\
    \ or LFNs [48].\n   Data rates are dynamic due to effects from other users and\
    \ from\n   mobility.  Arriving and departing users can reduce or increase the\n\
    \   available bandwidth in a cell.  Increasing the distance from the base\n  \
    \ station decreases the link bandwidth due to reduced link quality.\n   Finally,\
    \ by simply moving into another cell the user can experience a\n   sudden change\
    \ in available bandwidth.  For example, if upon changing\n   cells a connection\
    \ experiences a sudden increase in available\n   bandwidth, it can underutilize\
    \ it, because during congestion\n   avoidance TCP increases the sending rate slowly.\
    \  Changing from a\n   fast to a slow cell normally is handled well by TCP due\
    \ to the self-\n   clocking property.  However, a sudden increase in RTT in this\
    \ case\n   can cause a spurious TCP timeout as described in Section 2.7.  In\n\
    \   addition, a large TCP window used in the fast cell can create\n   congestion\
    \ resulting in overbuffering in the slow cell.\n"
- title: 2.3 Asymmetry
  contents:
  - "2.3 Asymmetry\n   2.5G/3G systems may run asymmetric uplink and downlink data\
    \ rates.\n   The uplink data rate is limited by battery power consumption and\n\
    \   complexity limitations of mobile terminals.  However, the asymmetry\n   does\
    \ not exceed 3-6 times, and can be tolerated by TCP without the\n   need for techniques\
    \ like ACK congestion control or ACK filtering\n   [50].  Accordingly, this document\
    \ does not include recommendations\n   meant for such highly asymmetric networks.\n"
- title: 2.4 Delay Spikes
  contents:
  - "2.4 Delay Spikes\n   A delay spike is a sudden increase in the latency of the\n\
    \   communication path.  2.5G/3G links are likely to experience delay\n   spikes\
    \ exceeding the typical RTT by several times due to the\n   following reasons.\n\
    \   1. A long delay spike can occur during link layer recovery from a\n      link\
    \ outage due to temporal loss of radio coverage, for example,\n      while driving\
    \ into a tunnel or within an elevator.\n   2. During a handover the mobile terminal\
    \ and the new base station\n      must exchange messages and perform some other\
    \ time-consuming\n      actions before data can be transmitted in a new cell.\n\
    \   3. Many wide area wireless networks provide seamless mobility by\n      internally\
    \ re-routing packets from the old to the new base station\n      which may cause\
    \ extra delay.\n   4. Blocking by high-priority traffic may occur when an arriving\n\
    \      circuit-switched call or higher priority data temporarily preempts\n  \
    \    the radio channel.  This happens because most current terminals\n      are\
    \ not able to handle a voice call and a data connection\n      simultaneously\
    \ and suspend the data connection in this case.\n   5. Additionally, a scheduler\
    \ in the radio network can suspend a low-\n      priority data transfer to give\
    \ the radio channel to higher\n      priority users.\n   Delay spikes can cause\
    \ spurious TCP timeouts, unnecessary\n   retransmissions and a multiplicative\
    \ decrease in the congestion\n   window size.\n"
- title: 2.5 Packet Loss Due to Corruption
  contents:
  - "2.5 Packet Loss Due to Corruption\n   Even in the face of a high probability\
    \ of physical layer frame\n   errors, 2.5G/3G systems have a low rate of packet\
    \ losses thanks to\n   link-level retransmissions.  Justification for link layer\
    \ ARQ is\n   discussed in [23], [22], [44].  In general, link layer ARQ and FEC\n\
    \   can provide a packet service with a negligibly small probability of\n   undetected\
    \ errors (failures of the link CRC), and a low level of loss\n   (non-delivery)\
    \ for the upper layer traffic, e.g., IP.  The loss rate\n   of IP packets is low\
    \ due to the ARQ, but the recovery at the link\n   layer appears as delay jitter\
    \ to the higher layers lengthening the\n   computed RTO value.\n"
- title: 2.6 Intersystem Handovers
  contents:
  - "2.6 Intersystem Handovers\n   In the initial phase of deployment, 3G systems\
    \ will be used as a 'hot\n   spot' technology in high population areas, while\
    \ 2.5G systems will\n   provide lower speed data service elsewhere.  This creates\
    \ an\n   environment where a mobile user can roam between 2.5G and 3G networks\n\
    \   while keeping ongoing TCP connections.  The inter-system handover is\n   likely\
    \ to trigger a high delay spike (Section 2.4), and can result in\n   data loss.\
    \  Additional problems arise because of context transfer,\n   which is out of\
    \ scope of this document, but is being addressed\n   elsewhere in the IETF in\
    \ activities addressing seamless mobility\n   [51].\n   Intersystem handovers\
    \ can adversely affect ongoing TCP connections\n   since features may only be\
    \ negotiated at connection establishment and\n   cannot be changed later.  After\
    \ an intersystem handover, the network\n   characteristics may be radically different,\
    \ and, in fact, may be\n   negatively affected by the initial configuration. \
    \ This point argues\n   against premature optimization by the TCP implementation.\n"
- title: 2.7 Bandwidth Oscillation
  contents:
  - "2.7 Bandwidth Oscillation\n   Given the limited RF spectrum, satisfying the high\
    \ data rate needs of\n   2.5G/3G wireless systems requires dynamic resource sharing\
    \ among\n   concurrent data users.  Various scheduling mechanisms can be deployed\n\
    \   in order to maximize resource utilization.  If multiple users wish to\n  \
    \ transfer large amounts of data at the same time, the scheduler may\n   have\
    \ to repeatedly allocate and de-allocate resources for each user.\n   We refer\
    \ to periodic allocation and release of high-speed channels as\n   Bandwidth Oscillation.\
    \  Bandwidth Oscillation effects such as\n   spurious retransmissions were identified\
    \ elsewhere (e.g., [30]) as\n   factors that degrade throughput.  There are research\
    \ studies [52],\n   [54], which show that in some cases Bandwidth Oscillation\
    \ can be the\n   single most important factor in reducing throughput.  For fixed\
    \ TCP\n   parameters the achievable throughput depends on the pattern of\n   resource\
    \ allocation.  When the frequency of resource allocation and\n   de-allocation\
    \ is sufficiently high, there is no throughput\n   degradation.  However, increasing\
    \ the frequency of resource\n   allocation/de-allocation may come at the expense\
    \ of increased\n   signaling, and, therefore, may not be desirable.  Standards\
    \ for 3G\n   wireless technologies provide mechanisms that can be used to combat\n\
    \   the adverse effects of Bandwidth Oscillation.  It is the consensus of\n  \
    \ the PILC Working Group that the best approach for avoiding adverse\n   effects\
    \ of Bandwidth Oscillation is proper wireless sub-network\n   design [23].\n"

  - "3.1 2.5G Technologies: GPRS, HSCSD and CDMA2000 1XRTT\n   High Speed Circuit-Switched\
    \ Data (HSCSD) and General Packet Radio\n   Service (GPRS) are extensions of GSM\
    \ providing high data rates for a\n   user.  Both extensions were developed first\
    \ by ETSI and later by\n   3GPP.  In GSM, a user is assigned one timeslot downlink\
    \ and one\n   uplink.  HSCSD allocates multiple timeslots to a user creating a\
    \ fast\n   circuit-switched link.  GPRS is based on packet-switched technology\n\
    \   that allows efficient sharing of radio resources among users and\n   always-on\
    \ capability.  Several terminals can share timeslots.  A GPRS\n   network uses\
    \ an updated base station subsystem of GSM as the access\n   network; the GPRS\

- title: '3.2 A 3G Technology: W-CDMA'
  contents:
  - "3.2 A 3G Technology: W-CDMA\n   The International Telecommunication Union (ITU)\
    \ has selected Wideband\n   Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA) as one of the\
    \ global telecom\n   systems for the IMT-2000 3G mobile communications standard.\
    \  W-CDMA\n   specifications are created in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project\n\
    \   (3GPP).\n   The link layer characteristics of the 3G network which have the\n\
    \   largest effect on TCP performance over the link are error controlling\n  \
    \ schemes such as layer two ARQ (L2 ARQ) and FEC (forward error\n   correction).\n\
    \   W-CDMA uses RLC (Radio Link Control) [20], a Selective Repeat and\n   sliding\
    \ window ARQ.  RLC uses protocol data units (PDUs) with a 16\n   bit RLC header.\
    \  The size of the PDUs may vary.  Typically, 336 bit\n   PDUs are implemented\
    \ [34].  This is the unit for link layer\n   retransmission.  The IP packet is\
    \ fragmented into PDUs for\n   transmission by RLC.  (For more fragmentation discussion,\
    \ see Section\n   4.4.)\n   In W-CDMA, one to twelve PDUs (RLC frames) constitute\
    \ one FEC frame,\n   the actual size of which depends on link conditions and bandwidth\n\
    \   allocation.  The FEC frame is the unit of interleaving.  This\n   accumulation\
    \ of PDUs for FEC adds part of the latency mentioned in\n   Section 2.1.\n   For\
    \ reliable transfer, RLC has an acknowledged mode for PDU\n   retransmission.\
    \  RLC uses checkpoint ARQ [20] with \"status report\"\n   type acknowledgments;\
    \ the poll bit in the header explicitly solicits\n   the peer for a status report\
    \ containing the sequence number that the\n   peer acknowledges.  The use of the\
    \ poll bit is controlled by timers\n   and by the size of available buffer space\
    \ in RLC.  Also, when the\n   peer detects a gap between sequence numbers in received\
    \ frames, it\n   can issue a status report to invoke retransmission.  RLC preserves\n\
    \   the order of packet delivery.\n   The maximum number of retransmissions is\
    \ a configurable RLC parameter\n   that is specified by RRC [39] (Radio Resource\

- title: 4.8 TCP Timestamps Option (Sender & Receiver)
  contents:
  - "4.8 TCP Timestamps Option (Sender & Receiver)\n   Traditionally, TCPs collect\
    \ one RTT sample per window of data [14],\n   [17].  This can lead to an underestimation\
    \ of the RTT, and spurious\n   timeouts on paths in which the packet transmission\
    \ delay dominates\n   the RTT.  This holds despite a conservative retransmit timer\
    \ such as\n   the one specified in RFC 2988 [11].  TCP connections with large\n\
    \   windows may benefit from more frequent RTT samples provided with\n   timestamps\
    \ by adapting quicker to changing network conditions [2].\n   However, there is\
    \ some empirical evidence that for TCPs with an RFC\n   2988 timer [11], timestamps\
    \ provide little or no benefits on backbone\n   Internet paths [59].   Using the\
    \ TCP Timestamps option has the\n   advantage that retransmitted segments can\
    \ be used for RTT\n   measurement, which is otherwise forbidden by Karn's algorithm\
    \ [17],\n   [11].  Furthermore, the TCP Timestamps option is the basis for\n \
    \  detecting spurious retransmits using the Eifel algorithm [30].\n   A 2.5/3G\
    \ link (layer) is dedicated to a single host.  It therefore\n   only experiences\
    \ a low degree of statistical multiplexing between\n   different flows.  Also,\
    \ the packet transmission and queuing delays of\n   a 2.5/3G link often dominate\
    \ the path's RTT.  This already results in\n   large RTT variations as packets\
    \ fill the queue while a TCP sender\n   probes for more bandwidth, or as packets\
    \ drain from the queue while a\n   TCP sender reduces its load in response to\
    \ a packet loss.  In\n   addition, the delay spikes across a 2.5/3G link (see\
    \ Section 2.4) may\n   often exceed the end-to-end RTT.  The thus resulting large\
    \ variations\n   in the path's RTT may often cause spurious timeouts.\n   When\
    \ running TCP in such an environment, it is therefore advantageous\n   to sample\
    \ the path's RTT more often than only once per RTT.  This\n   allows the TCP sender\
    \ to track changes in the RTT more closely.  In\n   particular, a TCP sender can\
    \ react more quickly to sudden increases\n   of the RTT by sooner updating the\
    \ RTO to a more conservative value.\n   The TCP Timestamps option [2] provides\
    \ this capability, allowing the\n   TCP sender to sample the RTT from every segment\
    \ that is acknowledged.\n   Using timestamps in the mentioned scenario leads to\
    \ a more\n   conservative TCP retransmission timer and reduces the risk of\n \
    \  triggering spurious timeouts [45], [52], [54], [60].\n   There are two problematic\
    \ issues with using timestamps:\n   o  12 bytes of overhead are introduced by\
    \ carrying the TCP Timestamps\n      option and padding in the TCP header.  For\
    \ a small MTU size, it\n      can present a considerable overhead.  For example,\
    \ for an MTU of\n      296 bytes the added overhead is 4%.  For an MTU of 1500\
    \ bytes, the\n      added overhead is only 0.8%.\n   o  Current TCP header compression\
    \ schemes are limited in their\n      handling of the TCP options field.  For\
    \ RFC 2507 [13], any change\n      in the options field (caused by timestamps\
    \ or SACK, for example)\n      renders the entire field uncompressible (leaving\
    \ the TCP/IP header\n      itself compressible, however).  Even worse, for RFC\
    \ 1144 [40] such\n      a change in the options field effectively disables TCP/IP\
    \ header\n      compression altogether.  This is the case when a connection uses\n\
    \      the TCP Timestamps option.  That option field is used both in the\n   \
    \   data and the ACK path, and its value typically changes from one\n      packet\
    \ to the next.  The IETF is currently specifying a robust\n      TCP/IP header\
    \ compression scheme with better support for TCP\n      options [29].\n   The\
    \ original definition of the timestamps option [2] specifies that\n   duplicate\
    \ segments below cumulative ACK do not update the cached\n   timestamp value at\
    \ the receiver.  This may lead to overestimating of\n   RTT for retransmitted\
    \ segments.  A possible solution [47] allows the\n   receiver to use a more recent\
    \ timestamp from a duplicate segment.\n   However, this suggestion allows for\
    \ spoofing attacks against the TCP\n   receiver.  Therefore,  careful consideration\
    \ is needed in\n   implementing this solution.\n   Recommendation: TCP SHOULD\
    \ use the TCP Timestamps option.  It allows\n   for better RTT estimation and\
    \ reduces the risk of spurious timeouts.\n"

    \ settings\n   that may increase end-to-end performance when running TCP across\n\
    \   2.5G/3G networks.  Note, that apart from the discussion of the RTO's\n   initial\
    \ value, those mechanisms and parameter settings are not part\n   of any standards\
    \ track RFC at the time of this writing.  Therefore,\n   they cannot be recommended\
    \ for the Internet in general.\n   Other mechanisms for increasing TCP performance\
    \ include enhanced TCP/\n   IP header compression schemes [29], active queue management\
    \ RFC 2309\n   [28], link layer retransmission schemes [23], and caching packets\n\
    \   during transient link outages to retransmit them locally when the\n   link\
    \ is restored to operation [23].\n   Shortcomings of existing TCP/IP header compression\
    \ schemes (RFC 1144\n   [40], RFC 2507 [13]) are that they do not compress headers\
    \ of\n   handshaking packets (SYNs and FINs), and that they lack proper\n   handling\
    \ of TCP option fields (e.g., SACK or timestamps) (see Section\n   4.8).   Although\
    \ RFC 3095 [12] does not yet address this issue, the\n   IETF is developing improved\
    \ TCP/IP header compression schemes,\n   including better handling of TCP options\
    \ such as timestamps and\n   selective acknowledgements.  Especially, if many\
    \ short-lived TCP\n   connections run across the link, the compression of the\
    \ handshaking\n   packets may greatly improve the overall header compression ratio.\n\
    \   Implementing active queue management is attractive for a number of\n   reasons\
    \ as outlined in RFC 2309 [28].  One important benefit for\n   2.5G/ 3G networks,\
    \ is that it minimizes the amount of potentially\n   stale data that may be queued\
    \ in the network (\"clicking from page to\n   page\" before the download of the\
    \ previous page is complete).\n   Avoiding the transmission of stale data across\
    \ the 2.5G/3G radio link\n   saves transmission (battery) power, and increases\
    \ the ratio of useful\n   data over total data transmitted.  Another important\
    \ benefit of\n   active queue management for 2.5G/3G networks, is that it reduces\
    \ the\n   risk of a spurious timeout for the first data segment as outlined\n\
    \   below.\n   Since 2.5G/3G networks are commonly characterized by high delays,\n\
    \   avoiding unecessary round-trip times is particularly attractive.\n   This\
    \ is specially beneficial for short-lived, transactional (request/\n   response-style)\
    \ TCP sessions that typically result from browsing the\n   Web from a smart phone.\
    \  However, existing solutions such as T/TCP\n   RFC 1644 [27], have not been\
    \ adopted due to known security concerns\n   [38].\n   Spurious timeouts, packet\
    \ re-ordering, and packet duplication may\n   reduce TCP's performance.  Thus,\
    \ making TCP more robust against those\n   events is desirable.  Solutions to\
    \ this problem have been proposed\n   [30], [35], [41], and standardization work\
    \ within the IETF is ongoing\n   at the time of writing.  Those solutions include\
    \ reverting congestion\n   control state after such an event has been detected,\
    \ and adapting the\n   retransmission timer and duplicate acknowledgement threshold.\
    \  The\n   deployment of such solutions may be particularly beneficial when\n\
    \   running TCP across wireless networks because wireless access links\n   may\
    \ often be subject to handovers and resource preemption, or the\n   mobile transmitter\
    \ may traverse through a radio coverage hole.  Such\n   disrupting events may\
    \ easily trigger a spurious timeout despite a\n   conservative retransmission\
    \ timer.  Also, the mobility mechanisms of\n   some wireless networks may cause\
    \ packet duplication.\n   The algorithm for computing TCP's retransmission timer\
    \ is specified\n   in RFC 2988 [11].  The standard specifies that the initial\
    \ setting of\n   the retransmission timeout value (RTO) should not be less than\
    \ 3\n   seconds.  This value might be too low when running TCP across 2.5G/3G\n\
    \   networks.  In addition to its high latencies, those networks may be\n   run\
    \ at bit rates of as low as about 10 kb/s which results in large\n   packet transmission\
    \ delays.  In this case, the RTT for the first data\n   segment may easily exceed\
    \ the initial TCP retransmission timer\n   setting of 3 seconds.  This would then\
    \ cause a spurious timeout for\n   that segment.  Hence, in such situations it\
    \ may be advisable to set\n   TCP's initial RTO to a value larger than 3 seconds.\
    \  Furthermore, due\n   to the potentially large packet transmission delays, a\
    \ TCP sender\n   might choose to refrain from initializing its RTO from the RTT\n\
    \   measured for the SYN, but instead take the RTT measured for the first\n  \
    \ data segment.\n   Some of the recommendations in RFC 2988 [11] are optional,\
    \ and are\n   not followed by all TCP implementations.  Specifically, some TCP\n\
    \   stacks allow a minimum RTO less than the recommended value of 1\n   second\
    \ (section 2.4 of [11]), and some implementations do not\n   implement the recommended\
    \ restart of the RTO timer when an ACK is\n   received (section 5.3 of [11]).\
    \  Some experiments [52], [54], have\n   shown that in the face of bandwidth oscillation,\
    \ using the\n   recommended minimum RTO value of 1 sec (along with the also\n\
    \   recommended initial RTO of 3 sec) reduces the number of spurious\n   retransmissions\
    \ as compared to using small minimum RTO values of 200\n   or 400 ms.  Furthermore,\
    \ TCP stacks that restart the retransmission\n   timer when an ACK is received\
    \ experience far less spurious\n   retransmissions than implementations that do\
    \ not restart the RTO\n   timer when an ACK is received.  Therefore, at the time\
    \ of this\n   writing, it seems preferable for TCP implementations used in 3G\n\
    \   wireless data transmission to comply with all recommendations of RFC\n   2988.\n"
