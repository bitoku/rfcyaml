  - "Abstract\n   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and Request for Comments\n\
    \   (RFC) Editor have a long-standing rule that a document at a given\n   maturity\
    \ level cannot be published until all of the documents that it\n   references\
    \ as normative are at that maturity level or higher.  This\n   rule has sometimes\
    \ resulted in very long publication delays for\n   documents and some claims that\
    \ it was a major obstruction to\n   advancing documents in maturity level.  The\
    \ IETF agreed on a way to\n   bypass this rule with RFC 3967.  This document describes\
    \ a simpler\n   procedure for downward references to Standards-Track and Best\
    \ Current\n   Practice (BCP) documents, namely \"note and move on\".  The procedure\n\
    \   in RFC 3967 still applies for downward references to other classes of\n  \
    \ documents.  In both cases, annotations should be added to such\n   References.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF and RFC Editor have a long-standing rule (see,\
    \ e.g., RFC\n   2026, Section 4.2.4 [RFC2026] and the extended discussion in RFC\
    \ 3967\n   [RFC3967]) that a document at a given maturity level cannot be\n  \
    \ published until all of the documents to which it makes a normative\n   reference\
    \ are at that maturity level or higher.  This rule has\n   sometimes resulted\
    \ in very long publication delays for documents and\n   some claims that it was\
    \ a major obstruction to advancing documents in\n   maturity level.  Recognizing\
    \ the problems that this rule sometimes\n   caused, RFC 3967 established an exception\
    \ procedure for normative\n   downward references under some specific circumstances.\
    \  Perhaps\n   because of its fairly stringent requirements, RFC 3967 has not\
    \ proven\n   adequate either to clear the backlog of documents awaiting upgraded\n\
    \   documents or to prevent additional documents from joining that queue.\n  \
    \ This document replaces the long-standing rule for downward references\n   to\
    \ Standards-Track documents (including BCPs) that are already\n   published. \
    \ For normative references to Standards-Track and BCP\n   documents, that rule\
    \ was to hold the newer, referencing, document\n   until the referenced ones could\
    \ be brought to the appropriate\n   maturity level.  It is now possible, following\
    \ procedures described\n   below, to simply note the downward normative reference\
    \ and move on.\n   This document also updates RFC 3967.  When downward references\
    \ from a\n   source document are approved under the procedure specified in that\n\
    \   specification, we recommend that the references in the approved\n   (source)\
    \ document be annotated in the same way as references approved\n   under this\
    \ rule.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   A reference involves two documents, the one in which the\
    \ reference is\n   embedded and the document referenced.  Where needed for clarity,\n\
    \   these documents are referred to as the \"source document\" and \"target\n\
    \   document\", respectively.\n   The term \"Standards-Track document\", as used\
    \ in this specification,\n   is assumed to include BCPs but not Informational\
    \ or Experimental\n   documents of any variety or origin.\n"
- title: 3.  Normative Reference Rule
  contents:
  - "3.  Normative Reference Rule\n   This document specifies an alternative to holding\
    \ source documents\n   until all target documents referenced normatively are upgraded\
    \ or by\n   applying the procedure of RFC 3967.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Source Documents Not Yet Processed by the IESG
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Source Documents Not Yet Processed by the IESG\n   An author or editor\
    \ who requires a normative downward reference to a\n   Standards-Track RFC uses\
    \ the following very simple procedure:\n   o  The reference text (i.e., in the\
    \ \"Normative References\" section of\n      the source document) is written as\
    \ usual.\n   o  A note is included in the reference text that indicates that the\n\
    \      reference is to a target document of a lower maturity level, that\n   \
    \   some caution should be used since it may be less stable than the\n      document\
    \ from which it is being referenced, and, optionally,\n      explaining why the\
    \ downward reference is appropriate.\n   The Internet Engineering Steering Group\
    \ (IESG) may, at its\n   discretion, specify the exact text to be used, establish\
    \ procedures\n   regarding the text to use, or give guidance on this text.  When\n\
    \   establishing procedures, the IESG should seek appropriate community\n   review.\n\
    \   These annotations are part of the source document.  If members of the\n  \
    \ community consider either the downward reference or the annotation\n   text\
    \ to be inappropriate, those issues can be raised at any time\n   during the document\
    \ life cycle, just as with any other text in the\n   document.  There is no separate\
    \ review of these references.\n   With appropriate community review, the IESG\
    \ may establish procedures\n   for when normative downward references should delay\
    \ a document and\n   when downward references should be noted.  Absent specific\
    \ guidance,\n   authors and reviewers should use their best judgment.  It is assumed\n\
    \   that, in a significant majority of cases, noting a downward reference\n  \
    \ is preferable to delaying publication.\n   At the option of the author, similar\
    \ notes may be attached to non-\n   normative references.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Documents Already in the RFC Editor Queue
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Documents Already in the RFC Editor Queue\n   The IESG may, at its discretion,\
    \ specify a procedure to be applied to\n   source documents that are already in\
    \ the RFC Editor queue, awaiting\n   target referenced documents.  The IESG should\
    \ encourage authors with\n   documents in the RFC Editor queue awaiting downward\
    \ references to\n   Standards-Track RFCs to evaluate whether this new rule is\
    \ appropriate\n   for their documents.  If authors believe that adding an annotation\n\
    \   and releasing the document is the best way forward, then the IESG\n   should\
    \ ensure that appropriate review is conducted and, if that\n   review agrees with\
    \ that of the authors' evaluation, allow the\n   annotations to be added.  The\
    \ IESG will announce its decision via the\n   normal Protocol-Action or Document-Action\
    \ mechanisms.\n"
- title: 4.  Target Documents Not on the Standards Track
  contents:
  - "4.  Target Documents Not on the Standards Track\n   In the case of a normative\
    \ reference to a document not on the\n   standards track that is approved under\
    \ the procedures defined in RFC\n   3967, the annotation described in Section\
    \ 3.1 or the retrospective\n   annotation described in Section 3.2, SHOULD be\
    \ added to the reference\n   unless the IESG, after consideration of Last Call\
    \ input, concludes it\n   is inappropriate.\n"
- title: 5.  Target Documents that Can Be Referenced This Way
  contents:
  - "5.  Target Documents that Can Be Referenced This Way\n   The \"downward reference\
    \ by annotation\" model specified here is\n   applicable only to published Standards-Track\
    \ RFCs at lower maturity\n   levels.\n   Obviously, such downward references are\
    \ part of the relevant source\n   document at IETF Last Call and subject to comments\
    \ from the\n   community.\n   Advancing documents, when appropriate, is still\
    \ considered preferable\n   to the use of either this procedure or the one specified\
    \ in RFC 3967.\n   This specification does not impose a specific test or requirement\
    \ to\n   determine appropriateness.  This is partially because it would be\n \
    \  impossible to do so for the general case, but more so because the\n   intention\
    \ is to permit the IESG and the community to balance the\n   importance of getting\
    \ a source document published against the time\n   and difficulty associated with\
    \ upgrading a target document.  That\n   requirement is intended to be less stringent\
    \ than the one of RFC\n   3967.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This document specifies an IETF procedure.  It\
    \ is not believed to\n   raise any security issues although, in principle, relaxing\
    \ the\n   normative downward reference rules for references associated with\n\
    \   security mechanisms could make a specification less stable and hence\n   less\
    \ secure.\n"

    \ Dawkins and many\n   complaints about the negative impact of the current rules.\
    \  The\n   author is unsure about the validity of some of those complaints; the\n\
    \   proposal is, in part, a way to test the validity question.  Spencer\n   also\
    \ provided helpful comments on a preliminary version.  It was\n   revised in response\
