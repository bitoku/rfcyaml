  - "Abstract\n   The IETF intends to provide a new tool to Working Group chairs and\n\
    \   Area Directors for the creation and updating of milestones for\n   Working\
    \ Group charters.  This document describes the requirements for\n   the proposed\
    \ new tool, and it is intended as input to a later\n   activity for the design\
    \ and development of such a tool.  This\n   document updates RFC 6292.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC2418] describes the guidelines and procedures for operation\
    \ of\n   IETF Working Groups (WGs).  Every WG has milestones that the WG is\n\
    \   supposed to meet, such as the publication of a particular Internet-\n   Draft\
    \ or the beginning of discussion on a particular topic.  A WG's\n   charter has\
    \ several parts; one of those parts is the milestones.\n   Changing milestones\
    \ currently requires Area Director (AD) approval,\n   but changing the charter\
    \ text requires IESG approval.\n   Today, the tasks associated with creating and\
    \ updating WG milestones\n   are performed manually by the Secretariat.  Normally,\
    \ WG chairs send\n   email to their AD requesting that milestones be created or\
    \ updated.\n   They send mail to the their AD, or directly to the Secretariat,\
    \ when\n   one or more milestone has been met.  Apart from during WG creation,\n\
    \   these updates will be made through a separate tool after the\n   requirements\
    \ in this document and in [RFC6292] are met.\n   In early 2011, the IETF approved\
    \ a set of requirements for a tool\n   that helps ADs with the WG chartering and\
    \ rechartering process\n   [RFC6292].  During the IESG discussion of that document,\
    \ it became\n   clear that everyone wanted more automation to the milestones process.\n\
    \   This document is intended to bring that discussion to a general\n   consensus\
    \ for the requirements for the eventual tool.\n   Note that this document only\
    \ discusses updating milestones that an\n   active WG is working against.  As\
    \ described in [RFC6292], when a WG\n   is rechartering, the new charter might\
    \ also include new milestones.\n   The tool described here must not change the\
    \ milestones that are\n   proposed for a WG recharter.  That is, there must be\
    \ two sets of\n   milestones kept by the Datatracker, one for the current WG charter\n\
    \   and one for a proposed recharter; the tool described here must only\n   affect\
    \ the first of these two sets.\n   The IETF Administrative Oversight Committee\
    \ (IAOC) would like to\n   create a better tool for the tasks of WG milestone\
    \ creation and\n   updating, and this document lists the requirements for such\
    \ a tool.\n   When complete, this document may be used to issue an request for\n\
    \   proposals for the design and development of the tool.  This document\n   was\
    \ prepared at the request of the IAOC.\n"
- title: 2.  Users of the Tool
  contents:
  - "2.  Users of the Tool\n   This tool can only be used by WG chairs and ADs, not\
    \ by other members\n   of the IETF community.  The tool will use the login and\
    \ access\n   control features that will already be in place from the outcome of\n\
    \   the tool created by [RFC6292].  It is important to note that some\n   people\
    \ are chairs for more than one WG, and everyone must be able to\n   use the tool\
    \ for all of the WGs that they chair.\n   Any AD can add or update any milestone\
    \ for any WG.  Normally, an AD\n   would only add or update milestones in the\
    \ WGs for which they are the\n   responsible AD, but ADs are not bound by such\
    \ a limitation.  (This is\n   the same model used in the Datatracker for other\
    \ actions: it allows\n   one AD to carry the load for an AD who is temporarily\
    \ unable to\n   perform such tasks.)  WG chairs can only add or update milestones\
    \ for\n   WGs of which they are chairs.\n   The IETF Secretariat needs to be able\
    \ to perform the same tasks as\n   the ADs in order to fix problems or to make\
    \ emergency changes.\n   The database will record the date and person who initiates\
    \ any\n   addition of, or change to, a milestone.  The contents of the database\n\
    \   will be visible to the IETF community so that anyone can see who made\n  \
    \ a particular change to a milestone.\n"
- title: 3.  Updating, Adding, and Deleting Milestones
  contents:
  - "3.  Updating, Adding, and Deleting Milestones\n   A WG chair needs to see all\
    \ of the milestones for that chair's WG in\n   the tool.  The chair needs to be\
    \ able to change any milestone record\n   for that chair's WG.  In each existing\
    \ record, the chair needs to be\n   able to change the due date, the finished\
    \ date, the associated\n   Internet-Drafts, and the description of the milestone.\
    \  The chair\n   also needs to be able to delete existing milestones.\n   A WG\
    \ chair needs to be able to add one or more milestone records to\n   the database\
    \ for their WG.  The chair needs to be able to specify the\n   due date, zero\
    \ or more associated Internet-Drafts, and the\n   description of the record that\
    \ he or she is adding.\n"
- title: 4.  Acceptance of Milestone Additions and Changes
  contents:
  - "4.  Acceptance of Milestone Additions and Changes\n   There are six actions associated\
    \ with adding and changing milestones:\n   o  create new milestones\n   o  delete\
    \ milestones\n   o  change milestone descriptions\n   o  change milestone due\
    \ dates\n   o  change which Internet-Drafts are associated with a milestone\n\
    \   o  assert that a milestone is no longer due\n   In addition to the above six\
    \ actions, the tool must support\n   reordering of the list of milestones.\n \
    \  WG chairs can change milestone due dates, change which Internet-\n   Drafts\
    \ are associated with a milestone, can assert that a milestone\n   is no longer\
    \ due, for their WG, and reorder the list.  When any of\n   these three actions\
    \ are taken in the Datatracker, an email\n   notification is sent to the AD for\
    \ the WG as well as to the WG's\n   chairs; the changes are reflected immediately\
    \ in the Datatracker\n   without any need for approval from an AD.\n   WG chairs\
    \ can also create new milestones, delete milestones, and\n   change milestone\
    \ descriptions; however, any of these action are not\n   reflected in the Datatracker\
    \ until the action is approved by an AD.\n   When a WG chair makes the proposed\
    \ change, an email notification is\n   sent to the AD for the WG as well as to\
    \ the WG's chairs.\n   When creating a milestone, it must be possible to set a\
    \ due date.  It\n   must also be to change the due date at any time.\n   When\
    \ asserting that a milestone is no longer due, it must be possible\n   to provide\
    \ an arbitrary short description phrase.  Often this phrase\n   will be \"Done\"\
    , but other phrases such as \"On hold\" are also allowed.\n   When the Datatracker\
    \ presents a milestone, the only information that\n   is expected to be associated\
    \ with the provided phrase is that the\n   milestone is no longer due.  The Datatracker\
    \ will present the list of\n   milestones in the order given in the tool.\n  \
    \ As noted in Section 2, any AD can take any of these six actions, as\n   well\
    \ as reordering the list.  After this tool is launched, the IETF\n   Secretariat\
    \ will no longer need to post a change to the database\n   because the tool will\
    \ do this without intervention by the\n   Secretariat; however, the Secretariat\
    \ can take any of these six\n   actions as well.\n   When adding or editing a\
    \ milestone, the AD or WG Chair must be able\n   to review and change the proposed\
    \ change before committing the change\n   to the Datatracker.  This will help\
    \ prevent errors and reduce the\n   number of fixes that need to be made.\n  \
    \ Once a day, the Datatracker will look for changes to the milestones\n   for\
    \ a WG.  If changes to milestones have been made in the past 24\n   hours, the\
    \ Datatracker will send one message to the WG listing all\n   the changes from\
    \ that period.\n   The Datatracker needs to have a method for ADs and the Secretariat\
    \ to\n   see all the milestones that are pending approval.  This list should\n\
    \   be sorted by the responsible AD.\n"
- title: 5.  Mapping Milestones to Internet-Drafts
  contents:
  - "5.  Mapping Milestones to Internet-Drafts\n   There is currently no mechanism\
    \ to map WG milestones to Internet-\n   Drafts.  While most milestones map one-to-one\
    \ with Internet-Drafts,\n   some milestones do not map to any Internet-Draft (such\
    \ as those that\n   say when a general discussion will begin or finish), and other\n\
    \   milestones map to multiple Internet-Drafts (such as a milestone that\n   covers\
    \ a topic that has multiple related Internet-Drafts).  Some\n   Internet-Drafts\
    \ are part of more than one milestone.\n   The new tool is required to make mappings\
    \ between milestones and\n   Internet-Drafts explicit, and those drafts must be\
    \ listed in views of\n   the milestone.  This change will require a change to\
    \ the Datatracker\n   database to make such an association.\n   When an Internet-Draft\
    \ that is mapped to a milestone changes its\n   state to \"Submitted to IESG for\
    \ Publication\" as described in\n   [RFC6174], the tool will send a message to\
    \ the WG chairs to remind\n   them that they might want to update the milestone.\
    \  Note that this\n   message will not apply to all Internet-Drafts that are mapped\
    \ to a\n   milestone, so it is up to the WG chairs to decide what to do when\n\
    \   such a message is received.\n"
- title: 6.  Reminders for WG Chairs and ADs
  contents:
  - "6.  Reminders for WG Chairs and ADs\n   Milestone changes that do not require\
    \ AD approval are made\n   immediately.  Requested changes that require AD approval\
    \ are tracked\n   by the tool.  If the AD has not approved or rejected the change\n\
    \   within a week, email listing the request and the request date is sent\n  \
    \ to the WG chairs and AD.  That email is sent every week until the AD\n   has\
    \ approved or rejected the request; the WG chairs are CC'd on this\n   mail.\n\
    \   The tool will also send WG chairs reminders about pending milestones.\n  \
    \ A message is sent when a milestone is one month from being due, at\n   the time\
    \ a milestone is due, and every month in which a milestone is\n   overdue.\n \
    \  The tool will also send WG chairs reminders about Internet-Drafts\n   that\
    \ are mapped to milestones.  A message is sent when such a draft\n   is one month\
    \ from expiring, and at the time that a draft expires.  If\n   a milestone is\
    \ mapped to a draft that is expired, mail reminding the\n   chairs of this will\
    \ be sent weekly.\n   When a WG chair makes an Internet-Draft a WG work item,\
    \ the\n   Datatracker will remind them that they may want to also add that\n \
    \  document to a milestone.\n"
- title: 7.  Viewing Changes in Milestones
  contents:
  - "7.  Viewing Changes in Milestones\n   [RFC6292] describes an extension to the\
    \ Datatracker to allow the IETF\n   community to view, search, and track changes\
    \ to WG charters.  This\n   document updates those requirements to allow the IETF\
    \ community to\n   view, search, and track changes to WG milestones.\n   Section\
    \ 5.1 of [RFC6292] is updated to allow searching for any text\n   in a milestone's\
    \ description, as well as for the name of any\n   Internet-Draft name that is\
    \ mapped to any milestone.\n   A new capability will be added to the Datatracker\
    \ that is similar to\n   that described in Section 5.2 of [RFC6292], but instead\
    \ of showing\n   differences between charters, it shows differences between the\
    \ full\n   set of milestones.  Any time a milestone is added, deleted, or any\
    \ of\n   its fields changed, or the list is reordered, the full set of\n   milestones\
    \ is considered changed.  A user should be able to easily\n   compare two full\
    \ sets of milestones with the differences highlighted.\n   The tool should show\
    \ who made each change when changes are viewed.\n   These features should be found\
    \ in the same place as the features\n   described in Section 5.2 of [RFC6292].\n\
    \   The tool needs to provide an Atom feed [RFC4287] for the changes in\n   the\
    \ milestones for a WG.  The contents of the feed are the full WG\n   record, plus\
    \ an indication of what changed since the last entry in\n   the feed and who made\
    \ the change.  This feed is different than the\n   feed described in Section 5.3\
    \ of [RFC6292], but it should be offered\n   to users in the same places as that\
    \ feed is offered.\n   When a milestone is marked as no longer due, the Datatracker\
    \ will\n   display the month and year that this change was made and will display\n\
    \   the status (such as \"Done\" or \"On hold\").\n"
