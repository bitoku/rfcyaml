If the standard Host names are formed according to the proposed rules, the following implementation scheme, suggested by Steve Crocker, can be used.
Map <site> into an 8 bit number, S and map <machine> into an 8 bit number, M, where S   M   Network Address.
S and M can be selected such that specification of <site> alone could cause a default to the "primary" Host at the site.
Note that this scheme depends on a unique <site> designator for each IMP.
Some examples: If the "primary" Host at UCLA is the 91, let UCLA
X'01'   1 base 10 UCLA 91,S
X'41'   65 base 10 and UCLA alone
S   M   X'45'   69 base 10 BBN 10B,
133 base 10 and BBN alone
The primary Host for each IMP would be designated by the site and such information disseminated by the NIC.
