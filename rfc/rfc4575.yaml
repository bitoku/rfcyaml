  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework [10]
    defines\n   general mechanisms for subscribing to, and receiving notifications\n
    \  of, events within SIP networks.  It introduces the notion of a\n   package,
    which is a specific \"instantiation\" of the events framework\n   for a well-defined
    set of events.  Here, we define a SIP event\n   package for tightly coupled conferences.
    \ This package can be used by\n   the conference notification service as outlined
    in the SIP\n   conferencing framework [16].  As described there, subscriptions
    to a\n   conference URI are routed to the focus that is handling the\n   conference.
    \ It acts as the notifier and provides clients with\n   updates on conference
    state.\n   The information provided by this package is comprised of conference\n
    \  identifier(s), conference participants (optionally with their\n   statuses
    and media description), conference sidebars, conference\n   service URIs, etc.\n"

    \  \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",\n
    \  and \"OPTIONAL\" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1] and\n   indicate
    requirement levels for compliant implementations.\n   This document uses the conferencing
    terminology defined in\n   Conferencing Framework [16].  In addition, the \"roster\"
    term is used\n   to collectively refer to participants in a conference or a sub-\n
    \  conference.\n"

  - "3.  Conference Event Package\n   The conference event package allows a user to
    subscribe to the\n   information relating to a conference.  In SIP, conferences
    are\n   represented by URIs.  These URIs identify a SIP user agent (UA),\n   called
    a focus, that is responsible for ensuring that all users in\n   the conference
    can communicate with each other, as described in\n   Conferencing Framework [16].
    \ The focus has sufficient information\n   about the state of the conference to
    inform subscribers about it.\n   It is possible that a participant in the conference
    may in fact be\n   another focus.  In order to provide a more complete participant
    list,\n   the focus MAY subscribe to the conference package of the other focus\n
    \  to discover the participant list in the cascaded conference.  This\n   information
    can then be included in notifications by use of the\n   <cascaded-focus> element
    as specified by this package.\n   This section provides the details for defining
    a SIP-specific event\n   notification package, as specified by RFC 3265 [10].\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Event Package Name\n   The name of this event package is \"conference\".
      \ This package name is\n   carried in the Event and Allow-Events header, as
      defined in RFC 3265\n   [10].\n"

    - "3.2.  Filtering\n   Filters, which can be applied to conference subscriptions,
      are a\n   desirable feature and can be considered as a subject of future\n   standardization
      activities.  This document does not define the\n   filters for the conference
      package to be included in the SUBSCRIBE\n   body.\n   A SUBSCRIBE for a conference
      package, being sent without a body,\n   implies the default subscription filtering
      policy.  The default\n   policy is as follows:\n   o  Notifications are generated
      every time there is any change in the\n      state of the conference.\n   o
      \ Notifications do not normally contain full state; rather, they\n      only
      indicate the state that has changed.  The exception is a\n      NOTIFY sent
      in response to a SUBSCRIBE.  These NOTIFYs contain the\n      full state of
      the information requested by the subscriber.\n"

  - contents:
    - "3.3.  Subscription Duration\n   The default expiration time for a subscription
      to a conference is one\n   hour.  Once the conference ends, all subscriptions
      to that particular\n   conference are terminated, with a reason of \"noresource\"
      as defined\n   in RFC 3265 [10].\n"
    title: 3.3.  Subscription Duration
  - contents:
    - "3.4.  NOTIFY Bodies\n   According to RFC 3265 [10], the NOTIFY message will
      contain bodies\n   that describe the state of the subscribed resource.  This
      body is in\n   a format listed in the Accept header field of the SUBSCRIBE,
      or a\n   package-specific default if the Accept header field was omitted from\n
      \  the SUBSCRIBE.\n   In this event package, the body of the notification contains
      a\n   conference information document that describes the state of a\n   conference.
      \ All subscribers and notifiers MUST support the\n   \"application/conference-info+xml\"
      data format described in Sections 9\n   and 5.  By default, i.e., if no Accept
      header is specified to a\n   SUBSCRIBE request, the NOTIFY will contain a body
      in the\n   \"application/conference-info+xml\" data format.  If the Accept header\n
      \  field is present, it MUST include \"application/conference-info+xml\"\n   and
      MAY include any other types.\n"

    - "3.5.  Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests\n   The conference information
      contains very sensitive information.\n   Therefore, all subscriptions SHOULD
      be authenticated and then\n   authorized before approval.  Authorization policy
      is at the\n   discretion of the administrator, as always.\n   However, it is
      RECOMMENDED that all users in the conference be\n   allowed to subscribe to
      the conference event package.\n"

    - "3.6.  Notifier Generation of NOTIFY Requests\n   Notifications SHOULD be generated
      for the conference state when a new\n   participant joins (i.e., gets \"connected\"
      to) or a participant leaves\n   (i.e., gets \"disconnected\" from) the conference.\n
      \  Subject to a local focus policy, additional changes in participants'\n   status,
      changes in their media types, and other optional information\n   MAY be reported
      by the focus.\n   Changes in sidebar rosters SHOULD be reported by the focus
      to their\n   participants and MAY be reported to others, subject to local policy.\n
      \  Changes in conference identifiers and service URIs SHOULD be reported\n   by
      the focus to the conference package subscribers.\n   Changes in other conference
      state information MAY be reported by the\n   focus to the conference package
      subscribers.\n"

  - contents:
    - "3.7.  Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests\n   The SIP events framework
      expects packages to specify how a subscriber\n   processes NOTIFY requests in
      any package-specific ways, and in\n   particular, how it uses the NOTIFY requests
      to construct a coherent\n   view of the state of the subscribed resource.\n
      \  Typically, the NOTIFY for the conference package will only contain\n   information
      about those users whose state in the conference has\n   changed.  To construct
      a coherent view of the total state of all\n   users, a subscriber to the conference
      package will need to combine\n   NOTIFYs received over time.\n   Notifications
      within this package can convey partial information;\n   that is, they can indicate
      information about a subset of the state\n   associated with the subscription.
      \ This means that an explicit\n   algorithm needs to be defined in order to
      construct coherent and\n   consistent state.  The details of this mechanism
      are specific to the\n   particular document type.  See Section 4.6 for information
      on\n   constructing coherent information from an application/\n   conference-info+xml
      document.\n"

    - "3.8.  Handling of Forked Requests\n   By their nature, the conferences supported
      by this package are\n   centralized.  Therefore, SUBSCRIBE requests for a conference
      should\n   not generally fork.  If forking happens in the network, subscribers\n
      \  to this package MUST NOT establish more than a single SIP dialog as a\n   result
      of a single SUBSCRIBE request.  In the foci cascading case,\n   detailed conference
      information can be retrieved by establishing an\n   individual SUBSCRIBE dialog
      with each participating focus.\n"

    - "3.9.  Rate of Notifications\n   For reasons of congestion control, it is important
      that the rate of\n   notifications not become excessive.  As a result, it is
      RECOMMENDED\n   that the server does not generate notifications for a single\n
      \  subscriber at a rate faster than once every 5 seconds.\n"

    - "3.10.  State Agents\n   Conference state is ideally maintained in the element
      in which the\n   conference resides.  Therefore, a conference focus is the best-suited\n
      \  element to handle subscriptions to it.  Cascaded foci MAY implement\n   state
      agents (as defined in RFC 3265 [10]) for this package.\n"

    - "4.4.  Partial Notifications Mechanism\n   This specification defines a basic
      partial notifications mechanism by\n   using a 'state' attribute as described
      below.  This mechanism MUST be\n   supported by all subscribing clients.  Additional
      general partial\n   notifications mechanisms can be defined and applied to this
      package\n   in the future.\n   All sub-elements in the <conference-info> hierarchical
      XML structure\n   can be classified in two groups: permissible for partial\n
      \  notifications or not.  Elements that carry a substantial amount of\n   data
      that is subject to frequent changes are permissible for partial\n   notifications
      and have a 'state' attribute attached to them.  All\n   future extensions to
      this schema MUST define which extension elements\n   can also use this mechanism.
      \ All other elements can be updated as\n   atomic pieces of data only.\n   Below
      is the complete list of elements permissible to use the partial\n   notifications
      mechanism defined in this specification.  (Note that\n   future partial notifications
      mechanisms can potentially be applicable\n   to additional elements.)\n   o
      \ Element <conference-info>\n   o  Element <users>\n   o  Element <user>\n   o
      \ Element <endpoint>\n   o  Element <sidebars-by-val>\n   o  Element <sidebars-by-ref>\n
      \  The 'state' attribute value indicates whether the reported\n   information
      about the element is \"full\" or \"partial\", or whether the\n   element has
      been \"deleted\" from the conference state document.  The\n   default value
      of any 'state' attribute is \"full\".\n   A 'state' attribute of a child element
      in the document MUST be\n   consistent with its parent 'state'.  This means
      that if the parent's\n   'state' is \"full\", the state of its children MUST
      be \"full\".  If the\n   parent's 'state' is \"partial\", the state of its children
      MAY be\n   either \"partial\", \"full\", or \"deleted\".  A parent element with\n
      \  \"deleted\" 'state' SHOULD NOT contain child elements.  Any information\n
      \  provided for child elements of a \"deleted\" parent MUST be ignored by\n
      \  the package subscriber.\n"

    - "4.5.  Element Keys\n   The defined XML schema has a property of unique identification
      among\n   sub-elements of a common parent, which makes it possible to use the\n
      \  partial notifications mechanism defined in this document.  This\n   property
      is achieved by defining a key to each sub-element that can\n   appear multiple
      times under the common parent.\n   In the context of this specification, the
      element key is the set of\n   mandatory attributes or sub-elements of an element.
      \ The key value\n   MUST be unique for the element among its siblings of the
      same type.\n   In the context of this specification, two keys of type xs:anyURI
      are\n   considered to be equal if the UTF-8 representations of the keys\n   (including
      all URI parameters that can be included with the URI) are\n   identical.  Consequently,
      using relative URIs and lexical white space\n   in these keys is NOT RECOMMENDED.\n
      \  Below is the list of elements (subject to partial notifications of\n   their
      parent elements) with their keys as defined by this\n   specification:\n   o
      \ Element <user> uses as the key 'entity'\n   o  Element <endpoint> uses as
      the key 'entity'\n   o  Element <media> uses as the key 'id'\n   o  Element
      <entry> (child to <sidebars-by-val>) uses as the key\n      'entity'\n   o  Element

    - "4.6.  Constructing Coherent State Procedure\n   This section describes the
      algorithm for constructing a coherent\n   conference state by a subscriber to
      the conference package.  Using\n   software programming abstraction, the subscriber
      maintains a single\n   local version number for the whole conference document
      and a local\n   element instance for each element in the schema.  Also, for
      each\n   element with keys (as defined above), the subscriber maintains a\n
      \  virtual table with a row for each existing key value.\n   The first time
      a NOTIFY with a \"full\" document is received (as\n   indicated by the value
      of the 'state' attribute in the\n   <conference-info> element), the conference
      package subscriber MUST\n   set the local 'version' number to the value of the
      'version'\n   attribute from the received <conference-info> and populate local
      data\n   with the received information.\n   Each time a new NOTIFY is received,
      the value of the local version\n   number and the value of the 'version' attribute
      in the new received\n   document are compared.  If the value in the document
      is equal to or\n   less than the local version, the document is discarded without\n
      \  processing.\n   Otherwise, if the received NOTIFY contains a \"full\" or
      \"deleted\"\n   state, the conference package subscriber MUST set the local
      'version'\n   number to the value of the 'version' attribute from the received\n
      \  <conference-info> and replace the local information with the received\n   document.
      \ Receiving \"deleted\" state for the <conference-info>\n   element means that
      the conference has ceased to exist and the\n   subscriber SHOULD terminate the
      subscription by sending the SUBSCRIBE\n   with Expires = 0.\n   Otherwise (i.e.,
      if the received NOTIFY contains \"partial\" state), if\n   the 'version' number
      in the received document is more than one number\n   higher than the previous
      local version number, the subscriber MUST\n   generate a subscription refresh
      request to trigger a full state\n   notification.  If the 'version' number in
      the document is one higher\n   than the local version number, the local version
      number is updated\n   accordingly and the document is used to update the local
      content as\n   described below.\n   For each sub-element of the <conference-info>

      \  information about the conference and about participation in the\n   conference.
      \ The following non-normative diagram gives an example of\n   the overall hierarchy
      used in this format.  Conferences contain users\n   who can be represented by
      multiple endpoints, each of which can have\n   multiple media streams.  Conferences
      can also include or reference\n   \"sidebar conferences\".  When sidebar information
      is incorporated into\n   a conference information document in a <sidebars-by-val>
      element,\n   each <entry> element represents a sidebar and can include any\n

      \  presented through the conference document to the subscribers, is\n   obtained
      by the focus.  In many cases, the information can be\n   dynamically learned
      from the call signaling and can also be manually\n   populated by an administrator
      - all subject to local policies.  This\n   document specifies what the XML elements
      mean in order to allow the\n   subscribers to appropriately interpret it.  Some
      portions of the\n   information are intended for processing by automata; others
      are for\n   human consumption only.  For example, the <display-text> sub-elements\n
      \  of elements <conf-uris>, <service-uris>, <available-media>,\n   <host-info>,
      <endpoint>, and <media> are intended for display to\n   human subscribers only.\n
      \  Although in multiple places this document states that specific\n   information
      \"SHOULD\" be communicated to the subscribers, note that\n   particular conference
      package subscribers (e.g., representing a\n   moderator, an administrator, or
      a cascaded focus) rely on accuracy of\n   this information for their proper
      operation.  Therefore, a\n   conferencing server MUST ensure that all critical
      changes (stated\n   as \"SHOULD\") are communicated to these specific subscribers;\n
      \  otherwise, these changes MUST be communicated to all subscribers to\n   the

      information\n   document.  In this example, there are 32 participants in a voice\n
      \  conference.  The user Bob has been ejected from the conference by\n   Mike
      due to bad voice quality.  Note that there are three sidebars in\n   the conference;
      two are referenced just by their sidebar URIs, and\n   information about the
      third sidebar is included in this notification.\n   Also note that while this
      conference offers both audio and video\n   capabilities, only audio is currently

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   Subscriptions to conference state information
    can reveal very\n   sensitive information.  For this reason, it is RECOMMENDED
    that a\n   focus use a strong means for authentication and conference\n   information
    protection and that it apply comprehensive authorization\n   rules when using
    the conference notification mechanism defined in\n   this document.  The following
    sections will discuss each of these\n   aspects in more detail.\n"
  - contents:
    - "8.1.  Connection Security\n   It is RECOMMENDED that a focus authenticate a
      conference package\n   subscriber using the normal SIP authentication mechanisms,
      such as\n   Digest as defined in Section 22 of RFC 3261 [8].\n   The mechanism
      used for conveying the conference information MUST\n   ensure integrity and
      SHOULD ensure confidentially of the information.\n   In order to achieve these,
      an end-to-end SIP encryption mechanism,\n   such as S/MIME described in Section
      26.2.4 of RFC 3261 [8], SHOULD be\n   used.\n   If a strong end-to-end security
      means (such as above) is not\n   available, it is RECOMMENDED that a focus use
      mutual hop-by-hop\n   Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication and encryption\n
      \  mechanisms described in Section 26.2.2 \"SIPS URI Scheme\" and Section\n
      \  26.3.2.2 \"Interdomain Requests\" of RFC 3261 [8].\n"

    - "8.2.  Authorization Considerations\n   Generally speaking, conference applications
      are very concerned about\n   authorization decisions.  Mechanisms for establishing
      and enforcing\n   such authorization rules are a central concept throughout
      the SIP\n   Conferencing Framework [16].  Because most of the information about
      a\n   conference can be presented using the conference package, many of the\n
      \  authorization rules directly apply to this specification.  As a\n   result,
      a notification server MUST be capable of generating distinct\n   conference
      information views to different subscribers, subject to a\n   subscriber's role
      in a conference, personal access rights, etc. - all\n   subject to local authorization
      policies and rules.\n   Since a focus provides participant identity information
      using this\n   event package, participant privacy needs to be taken into account.
      \ A\n   focus MUST support requests by participants for privacy.  Privacy can\n
      \  be indicated by the conference policy - for every participant or\n   select
      participants.  It can also be indicated in the session\n   signaling.  In SIP,
      this can be done using the Privacy header field\n   described in RFC 3323 [11].
      \ For a participant requesting privacy, no\n   identity information SHOULD be
      revealed by the focus in any included\n   URI (e.g., the Address of Record,
      Contact, or GRUU).  For these\n   cases, the anonymous URI generation method
      outlined in Section 5.6 of\n   this document MUST be followed.\n"
