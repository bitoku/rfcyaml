Abstract This document defines a value of "application" for the vCard KIND property so that vCards can be used to represent software applications.
Introduction Version 4 of the vCard specification [RFC6350] defines a new KIND property to specify the type of entity that a vCard represents.
During its work on the base vCard4 specification, the VCARDDAV Working Group defined values of "individual", "organization", "group", and "location" for the KIND property.
The working group considered but then removed a value of "thing" to represent any type of physical entity, machine, software application, etc., with the expectation that such a value might be defined in a vCard extension.
This document does not define a generic "thing" value but instead defines a more narrow "application" value so that vCards can be used to represent software applications.
When the KIND property has a value of "application", the vCard represents a software application such as a server, an online service (e.g., a chat room), or an automated software bot.
More formally, an "application" is functionally equivalent to the 'applicationProcess' object class used in the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [RFC4519] as derived from the Open Systems Interconnection model [X.521] [X.200].
As one example of the "application" KIND, vCards are currently used in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
[RFC6120] to represent instant messaging servers that are deployed on the network.
The properties included in an application's vCard apply to one of the following:
The application itself (e.g., the FN property might represent the friendly name of an application service, the URL property might represent a website that contains further information about the service, and the ADR, GEO, and TZ properties might represent the physical address, geographical location, and time zone of the machine where the service is hosted).
An organization or person that makes the application available on the network (e.g., the LOGO property might represent the corporate logo of a service provider).
A person or role that maintains the application (e.g., the TEL, EMAIL, and IMPP properties might represent ways to contact a server administrator).
When a property represents some aspect of the application itself, it makes no sense to include the "work" and "home" values of the TYPE parameter since software applications do not have work places and personal lives (see the definition of the TYPE parameter in Section 5.6 of [RFC6350]).
When a property represents information about an individual associated with the application (e.g., an individual service administrator as opposed to a generic service administrator role or an associated organization), inclusion of the "work" and "home" values can be appropriate.
The following base properties make sense for vCards that represent software applications (this list is not exhaustive, and other properties might be applicable as well):  ADR  EMAIL  FN  GEO  IMPP
Although it might be desirable to define a more fine grained taxonomy of applications (e.g., a KIND of "application" with a subtype of "server" or "IM server"), such a taxonomy is out of the scope of this document.
The following example of an Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
(XMPP) server is borrowed from [XEP 0292].
The XML representation of the vCard is described in [RFC6351], which allows for the use of the new "application" value using the "iana token" production defined in [RFC6350].
<vcard xmlns "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:vcard 4.0"> <fn><text>

IANA Considerations IANA has added "application" to the registry of property values for vCard4.
In conformance with Section 10.2.6 of [RFC6350], the registration is as follows, where the reference is to RFC 6473.
The entity represented by the vCard is a software application (e.g., a server, an online service such as a chat room, or an automated software bot).
This value can be used with the KIND property.
See Section 3 of RFC 6473.
Security Considerations Use of vCards to represent software applications is not envisioned to introduce security considerations beyond those specified for vCards in general as described in [RFC6350].
