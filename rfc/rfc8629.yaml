- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) is defined in\
    \ [RFC8175].\n   It provides the exchange of link-related control information\
    \ between\n   a modem and a router.  DLEP defines a base set of mechanisms as\
    \ well\n   as support for possible extensions.  This document defines one such\n\
    \   extension.\n   Some modem technologies support mobile ad hoc network (MANET)\n\
    \   forwarding where connectivity to destinations is provided via\n   forwarding\
    \ in intermediate modems.  This document refers to\n   forwarding by intermediate\
    \ modems as \"multi-hop forwarding\".  DLEP\n   Destination Messages can be used\
    \ to report such reachable\n   destinations (see [RFC8175]), but do not provide\
    \ any information\n   related to the number or capacity of the hops.  The extension\
    \ defined\n   in this document enables modems to inform routers when multi-hop\n\
    \   forwarding is being used and allows routers to request that modems\n   change\
    \ multi-hop forwarding behavior.  The extension defined in this\n   document is\
    \ referred to as \"Multi-Hop Forwarding\", where each modem\n   that transmits/sends\
    \ data to reach a particular destination is\n   counted as a hop.\n   It is important\
    \ to note that the use of the Hop Control mechanism\n   defined in this document\
    \ can result in connectivity changes and even\n   loss of the ability to reach\
    \ one or more destinations.  The defined\n   mechanism will report such connectivity\
    \ changes, but the details of\n   what a router does or how it reacts to such\
    \ are out scope of this\n   document.\n   This document defines a new DLEP Extension\
    \ Type Value in Section 2,\n   which indicates the use of the extension, and three\
    \ new DLEP Data\n   Items in Section 3.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Extension Usage and Identification\n   The use of the Multi-Hop Forwarding\
    \ Extension SHOULD be configurable.\n   Per [RFC8175], to indicate that the extension\
    \ is to be used, an\n   implementation includes the Multi-Hop Forwarding Extension\
    \ Type Value\n   in the Extensions Supported Data Item.  The Extensions Supported\
    \ Data\n   Item is sent and processed according to [RFC8175].\n   The Multi-Hop\
    \ Forwarding Extension Type Value is 1 (see Section 5).\n"
- title: 3.  Extension Data Items
  contents:
  - "3.  Extension Data Items\n   Three data items are defined by this extension.\
    \  The Hop Count Data\n   Item is used by a modem to provide the number of modem\
    \ hops traversed\n   to reach a particular destination.  The Hop Control Data\
    \ Item is used\n   by a router to request that a modem alter connectivity to a\n\
    \   particular destination.  The Suppress Forwarding Data Item is used by\n  \
    \ a router to request that a modem disable multi-hop forwarding on\n   either\
    \ a device or destination basis.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Hop Count
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Hop Count\n   The Hop Count Data Item is used by a modem to indicate the\
    \ number of\n   modems that transmit/send data to reach a particular destination,\n\
    \   i.e., hops, between the modem and a specific destination.  In other\n   words,\
    \ each hop represents a transmission, and the number of hops is\n   equal to the\
    \ number of transmissions required to go from a router's\n   connected modem to\
    \ the destination's connected modem.  The minimum\n   number of hops is 1, which\
    \ represents transmission to destinations\n   that are directly reachable via\
    \ the router's locally connected modem.\n   The data item also contains an indication\
    \ of when a destination that\n   currently has a hop count of greater than one\
    \ (1) could be made\n   directly reachable by a modem, e.g., by reaiming an antenna.\n\
    \   The Hop Count Data Item SHOULD be carried in the Destination Up,\n   Destination\
    \ Update, Destination Announce Response, and Link\n   Characteristics Response\
    \ Messages when the Hop Count to a destination\n   is greater than one (1).\n\
    \   A router receiving a Hop Count Data Item can use this information in\n   its\
    \ forwarding and routing decisions, but specific use is out of\n   scope of this\
    \ document.  When using this extension, the absence of\n   the Hop Count Data\
    \ Item MUST be interpreted by the router as a Hop\n   Count value of one (1).\n\
    \   The format of the Hop Count Data Item is:\n        0                   1 \

    \      The Reserved field MUST be set to zero by the sender (a modem) and\n  \
    \    ignored by the receiver (a router).\n   Hop Count:\n      The Hop Count is\
    \ an unsigned 8-bit integer indicating the number\n      of modem hops required\
    \ (i.e., number of times a packet will be\n      transmitted) to reach the destination\
    \ indicated in the message.\n      The special value of 255 (0xFF) is used to\
    \ indicate that the\n      number of hops is an unknown number greater than one\
    \ (1).  This\n      field MUST contain a value of at least one (1) if the associated\n\
    \      destination is reachable.\n      A value of zero (0) is used to indicate\
    \ that the processing of a\n      Hop Control action (see Section 3.2) has resulted\
    \ in the\n      destination no longer being reachable.  A zero value MUST NOT\
    \ be\n      used in any message other than a Link Characteristics Response\n \
    \     Message.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Hop Control
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Hop Control\n   The Hop Control Data Item is used by a router to request\
    \ a change in\n   connectivity to a particular destination or to perform multi-hop\n\
    \   processing on a device-wide basis.  A router can request that a\n   multi-hop-reachable\
    \ destination be changed to a single-hop\n   destination.  A router can also indicate\
    \ that the modem terminates a\n   previous direct connectivity request to a particular\
    \ destination.\n   The Hop Control Data Item MAY be carried in a Session Update\
    \ Message\n   sent by a router when the control applies to the whole device, or\
    \ a\n   Link Characteristics Request Message when the control applies to a\n \
    \  particular destination.\n   A modem that receives the Hop Control Data Item\
    \ in a Link\n   Characteristics Request Message SHOULD take whatever actions are\n\
    \   needed to make the change indicated by the data item for the\n   associated\
    \ destination Media Access Control (MAC) address.  Once the\n   change is made,\
    \ fails, or is rejected, the modem MUST respond with a\n   Link Characteristics\
    \ Response Message containing an updated Hop Count\n   Data Item.  Note that other\
    \ destinations can be impacted as a result\n   of the change, and such changes\
    \ are reported in Destination Down and\n   Destination Update Messages.  The modem\
    \ MUST notify the router of\n   each destination that is not identified in the\
    \ Link Characteristics\n   Response Message and is no longer reachable via a Destination\
    \ Down\n   Message.  The modem MUST also notify the router of each impacted\n\
    \   destination that is not identified in the Link Characteristics\n   Response\
    \ Message via a Destination Update Message.\n   Failures may occur for multiple\
    \ reasons, for example, the\n   transmission characteristics of the link don't\
    \ support the one-hop\n   connection at the time of the request.  Requests can\
    \ be rejected by\n   local policy.\n   A modem that receives the Hop Control Data\
    \ Item in a Session Update\n   Message SHOULD take whatever actions are needed\
    \ to make the change\n   indicated by the data item for all known destinations.\
    \  Once the\n   change is made, fails, or is rejected, the modem MUST respond\
    \ with a\n   Session Update Response Message with an appropriate Status Code.\

    \ modem to destinations that are\n   one modem hop away, and that any data traffic\
    \ received by the modem\n   from another modem that is not destined to the peer\
    \ router SHALL be\n   dropped.  The impact on destination hop counts are provided\

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The extension defined in this document enables\
    \ the reporting and\n   control of forwarding information by DLEP-capable modems.\
    \  The\n   extension does not inherently introduce any additional\n   vulnerabilities\
    \ above those documented in [RFC8175].  The approach\n   taken to security in\
    \ that document applies equally when running the\n   extension defined in this\
    \ document.\n   The extension does define one mechanism that is worth particular\n\
    \   note.  It includes a Hop Control mechanism (see Section 3.2) that is\n   similar\
    \ to the Link Characteristics Request Message defined in\n   [RFC8175] in that\
    \ it can impact the set of destinations reported as\n   reachable.  With the Link\
    \ Characteristics Request Message, this risk\n   is implicit.  With the Hop Control\
    \ mechanism defined in this\n   document, it is more likely.  From a security\
    \ perspective,\n   implementations should be aware of this increased risk and\
    \ may choose\n   to implement additional configuration control mechanisms to ensure\n\
    \   that the Hop Control mechanism is only used under conditions intended\n  \
    \ by the network operator.\n   Implementations of the extension defined in this\
    \ document MUST\n   support configuration of TLS usage, as described in [RFC8175],\
    \ in\n   order to protect configurations where injection attacks are possible,\n\
    \   i.e., when the link between a modem and router is not otherwise\n   protected.\n\
    \   Note that this extension does allow a compromised or impersonating\n   modem\
    \ to suppress transmission by the router or a switch that\n   interconnects the\
    \ modem and router.  Similar attacks are generally\n   possible for DLEP, for\
    \ example, an impersonating modem may cause a\n   session reset or cause a compromised\
    \ modem to simply drop all traffic\n   destined to, or sent by, a router.  [RFC8175]\
    \ defines the use of TLS\n   to protect against the impersonating attacker.\n"
