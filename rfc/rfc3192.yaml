- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   As with all Internet mail addresses, the left-hand-side (local-part)\n\
    \   of an address generated according to this specification, is not to be\n  \
    \ interpreted except by the MTA that is named on the right-hand-side\n   (domain).\n\
    \   Since the very first e-mail to fax gateway objects appeared, a number\n  \
    \ of different methods to specify a fax address as an e-mail address\n   have\
    \ been used by implementors.  Several objectives for this methods\n   have been\
    \ identified, like to enable an e-mail user to send and\n   receive faxes from\
    \ his/her e-mail interface, to allow some kind of\n   \"fax over e-mail service\"\
    \ transport (possibly reducing the costs of\n   GSTN long distance transmissions)\
    \ while using the existing e-mail\n   infrastructure.\n   This memo describes\
    \ the MINIMAL addressing method and standard\n   extensions to encode FAX addresses\
    \ into e-mail addresses, as required\n   in reference [13].  The opposite problem,\
    \ i.e., to allow a\n   traditional numeric-only fax device user to access the\
    \ e-mail\n   transport service, is not discussed here.\n   These IANA forms used\
    \ to register the standard elements defined here\n   are given in the \"IANA Considerations\"\
    \ chapter (section 7 of this\n   document).\n   All implementations supporting\
    \ FAX over e-mail address format MUST\n   support this minimal specification.\n"

  - "1.1 Terminology and Syntax conventions\n   In this document the formal definitions\
    \ are described using ABNF\n   syntax, as defined into [7].  We will also use\
    \ some of the \"CORE\n   DEFINITIONS\" defined in \"APPENDIX A - CORE\" of that\
    \ document.  The\n   exact meaning of the capitalized words\n      \"MUST\", \"\

    \   In this document the following new terms are also defined:\n      I-fax device:\n\
    \         an I-pstn device type [13] which is able to communicate either\n   \
    \      directly or indirectly with the traditional FAX over GSTN\n         service;\n\
    \      mta-I-fax:\n         the Internet domain name which identifies uniquely\
    \ an I-fax\n         device over the Internet (see also mta-I-pstn in [13]);\n\
    \      fax-email:\n         the complete Internet e-mail address structure which\
    \ is used to\n         transport a FAX address over the Internet e-mail service\
    \ (see\n         also pstn-email in [13]).\n"
- title: 2. Minimal Fax address
  contents:
  - "2. Minimal Fax address\n   The minimal fax address within e-mail has been defined\
    \ for\n   consistency with reference [13] and it contains two elements: the\n\
    \   fax-mbox and an optional qualif-type1 element.\n   More precisely the GSTN\
    \ minimal address specification requires the\n   use of a unique service-selector\
    \ for each specific application\n   (section 2 in [13]).\n   The \"service-selector\"\
    \ defined for the fax service is as follows:\n      service-selector = \"FAX\"\
    \n   In the syntax for the fax address a qualif-type1 element has been\n   defined\
    \ for support of T.30/T.33 subaddresses (see section 2 of\n   [13]).  The use\
    \ of this element is OPTIONAL, but compliant\n   implementations MUST be able\
    \ to support and correctly interpret it\n   when present.  Its definition is as\
    \ follows:\n      qualif-type1 = \"/\" t33-sep \"=\" sub-addr\n   where\n    \
    \  t33-sep = \"T33S\"\n      sub-addr = 1*( DIGIT )\n   Thus, the minimal specification\
    \ of a fax in e-mail address is:\n      fax-address = fax-mbox [ \"/T33S=\" sub-addr\
    \ ]\n      fax-mbox = \"FAX=\" global-phone\n   Notes:\n      For the case of\
    \ a single subaddress, only numbers are allowed in\n      <sub-addr> which is\
    \ consistent with T.30, T.33, and this document.\n      While T.30 and T.33 use\
    \ SPACE to pad its field, padding isn't\n      necessary in the <sub-addr> field\
    \ defined by this document.\n      For the case of multiple subaddresses, T.33\
    \ specifies the \"#\"\n      character be used to specify multiple subaddreses.\
    \  However, only\n      digits are permitted in the <sub-addr> field defined by\
    \ this\n      document.  Refer to section 4.1 in case multiple <sub-addr> per\n\
    \      per <fax-mbox> need to be specified.\n   The Minimal supported syntax for\
    \ global-phone (as described in\n   section 2.1 of reference [13]) is:\n   global-phone\
    \ = \"+\" 1*( DIGIT / written-sep )\n   written-sep = ( \"-\" / \".\" )\n   Refer\
    \ to section 2.1 in [13] for other important considerations about\n   the global-phone\
    \ element.\n"

  contents:
  - "4. The fax-email\n   The complete structure used to transfer a minimal FAX address\
    \ over\n   the Internet e-mail transport system is called \"fax-email\".  This\n\
    \   object is a an e-mail address which conforms to [2] and [3]\n   \"addr-spec\"\
    \ syntax, with structure refinements which allows the FAX\n   number to be identified.\n\
    \   fax-email = [\"\"\"] [\"/\"] fax-address [\"/\"] [\"\"\"] \"@\" mta-I-fax\n\
    \   Implementors' note:\n      The optional \"/\" characters can result from translations\
    \ from\n      other transport gateways (such as some X.400 gateways) which have\n\
    \      included the \"/\" as an optional element.  Implementations MUST\n    \
    \  accept the optional slashes but SHOULD NOT generate them.\n      Gateways are\
    \ allowed to strip them off when converting to Internet\n      mail addressing.\
    \  The relevant standard [2], [3] define exactly\n      when the optional \"quotes\"\
    \ characters surrounding the entire local\n      part (i.e., the part on the left\
    \ of the \"@\" character into the\n      fax-email) MUST be added.\n"
- title: 4.1 Multiple subaddresses
  contents:
  - "4.1 Multiple subaddresses\n   There are some instances in GSTN applications where\
    \ multiple\n   subaddresses are used: T.33 subaddresses in fax service are one\
    \ of\n   these cases.  In e-mail practice a separate and unique e-mail address\n\
    \   is always used for each recipient; as such, if multiple T.33\n   subaddresses\
    \ are present, the use of multiple \"fax-email\" elements is\n   REQUIRED.\n \
    \  Implementors' note:\n      The UA MAY accept multiple subaddress elements for\
    \ the same\n      global-phone, but it MUST generate multiple \"fax-mbox\" elements\n\
    \      when submitting the message to the MTA.\n"

- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   This document specifies a means by which FAX addresses\
    \ can be encoded\n   into e-mail addresses.  Since e-mail routing is determined\
    \ by Domain\n   Name System (DNS) data, a successful attack to DNS could disseminate\n\
    \   tampered information, which causes e-mail messages to be diverted via\n  \
    \ some MTA or Gateway where the security of the software has been\n   compromised.\n\
    \   There are several means by which an attacker might be able to deliver\n  \
    \ incorrect mail routing information to a client.  These include: (a)\n   compromise\
    \ of a DNS server, (b) generating a counterfeit response to\n   a client's DNS\
    \ query, (c) returning incorrect \"additional\n   information\" in response to\
    \ an unrelated query.  Clients SHOULD\n   ensure that mail routing is based only\
    \ on authoritative answers.\n   Once DNS Security mechanisms [5] become more widely\
    \ deployed, clients\n   SHOULD employ those mechanisms to verify the authenticity\
    \ and\n   integrity of mail routing records.\n"
