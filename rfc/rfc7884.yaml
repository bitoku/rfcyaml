- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (S-BFD), specified\
    \ in\n   [RFC7880], is a simplified mechanism for using BFD with many\n   negotiations\
    \ eliminated.  This is achieved by using 4-octet\n   discriminators, unique within\
    \ an administrative domain, to identify\n   the network targets.  These S-BFD\
    \ Discriminators can be advertised by\n   the IGPs, and this document concerns\
    \ itself with OSPF.  Specifically,\n   this document defines a new TLV (named\
    \ the S-BFD Discriminator TLV)\n   to be carried within the OSPF Router Information\
    \ (RI) Link State\n   Advertisement (LSA) [RFC7770].\n   The key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to\
    \ be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Relationship between OSPF and S-BFD
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Relationship between OSPF and S-BFD\n   This document implicitly defines\
    \ a relationship between OSPF and\n   S-BFD.  S-BFD assigns one or more discriminators\
    \ to each S-BFD\n   reflector node.  OSPF, in turn, learns about these from S-BFD\
    \ and\n   floods them in the newly defined TLV.  After this information is\n \
    \  flooded, it is stored in all the OSPF nodes such that S-BFD\n   initiators\
    \ can map out target nodes to target discriminators and can\n   therefore construct\
    \ the S-BFD probe.\n   When multiple S-BFD Discriminators are advertised, how\
    \ a given\n   discriminator is mapped to a specific use case is out of scope for\n\
    \   this document.\n"
- title: 2.  Implementation
  contents:
  - "2.  Implementation\n   This extension makes use of the Router Information (RI)\
    \ Opaque LSA,\n   defined in [RFC7770], for both OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3 [RFC5340]\n\
    \   by defining a new OSPF Router Information (RI) TLV: the S-BFD\n   Discriminator\
    \ TLV.\n   The S-BFD Discriminator TLV is OPTIONAL.  Upon receipt of the TLV,\
    \ a\n   router may decide to install the S-BFD Discriminator in the BFD\n   target\
    \ identifier table.\n   In the presence of multiple instances of the OSPFv2/OSPFv3\
    \ Router\n   Information LSA, the S-BFD Discriminators for an OSPF router are\
    \ the\n   union of all discriminators advertised in all instances of the S-BFD\n\
    \   Discriminator TLV (see Section 2.1) in all advertised non-MaxAge OSPF\n  \
    \ Router Information LSAs.\n"

    \ the TLV [RFC7770] and therefore will not learn S-BFD\n   Discriminators via\

- title: 2.2.  Flooding Scope
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Flooding Scope\n   The S-BFD Discriminator TLV is advertised within OSPFv2\
    \ Router\n   Information LSAs (Opaque type of 4 and Opaque ID of 0) or OSPFv3\n\
    \   Router Information LSAs (function code of 12), which are defined in\n   [RFC7770].\
    \  As such, elements of this procedure are inherited from\n   those defined in\
    \ [RFC7770].\n   The flooding scope is controlled by the Opaque LSA type (as defined\n\
    \   in [RFC5250]) in OSPFv2 and by the S1/S2 bits (as defined in\n   [RFC5340])\
    \ in OSPFv3.  If the flooding scope is area local, then the\n   S-BFD Discriminator\
    \ TLV MUST be carried within an OSPFv2 type 10\n   Router Information LSA or an\
    \ OSPFV3 Router Information LSA with the\n   S1 bit set and the S2 bit clear.\
    \  If the flooding scope is the entire\n   IGP domain, then the S-BFD Discriminator\
    \ TLV MUST be carried within\n   an OSPFv2 type 11 Router Information LSA or OSPFv3\
    \ Router Information\n   LSA with the S1 bit clear and the S2 bit set.\n   When\
    \ the S-BFD reflector is deactivated, the OSPF speaker advertising\n   a particular\
    \ S-BFD Discriminator MUST originate a new Router\n   Information LSA that no\
    \ longer includes the corresponding S-BFD\n   Discriminator TLV, provided there\
    \ are other TLVs in the LSA.  If\n   there are no other TLVs in the LSA, it MUST\
    \ either send an empty\n   Router Information LSA or purge it by prematurely aging\
    \ it.\n   For intra-area reachability, the S-BFD Discriminator TLV information\n\
    \   regarding a specific target identifier is only considered current and\n  \
    \ usable when the router advertising that information is itself\n   reachable\
    \ via OSPF calculated paths in the same area of the LSA in\n   which the S-BFD\
    \ Discriminator TLV appears.  In the case of\n   domain-wide flooding, i.e., where\
    \ the originator is sitting in a\n   remote area, the mechanism described in Section\
    \ 5 of [RFC5250] should\n   be used.\n   Although the S-BFD Discriminators may\
    \ change when enabling the S-BFD\n   functionality or via an explicit configuration\
    \ event, such changes\n   are expected to occur very rarely.  Such changes in\
    \ information will\n   require that the S-BFD Discriminator TLV in OSPF be advertised.\n\
    \   A change in information in the S-BFD Discriminator TLV MUST NOT\n   trigger\
    \ any SPF computations at a receiving router.\n"
- title: 3.  Backward Compatibility
  contents:
  - "3.  Backward Compatibility\n   The S-BFD Discriminator TLV defined in this document\
    \ does not\n   introduce any interoperability issues.\n   A router not supporting\
    \ the S-BFD Discriminator TLV will just\n   silently ignore the TLV, as specified\
    \ in [RFC7770].\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document defines OSPF extensions to distribute\
    \ the S-BFD\n   Discriminator within an administrative domain.  Hence, the security\n\
    \   of S-BFD Discriminator distribution relies on the security of OSPF.\n   OSPF\
    \ provides no encryption mechanism for protecting the privacy of\n   LSAs and,\
    \ in particular, the privacy of the S-BFD Discriminator\n   advertisement information.\
    \  However, this is not a concern, as there\n   isn't any need to hide the Discriminator\
    \ value that can be used to\n   reach the reflectors.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has defined a registry for TLVs carried in the\
    \ Router\n   Information LSA defined in [RFC7770].  IANA has assigned a new TLV\n\
    \   codepoint (11) for the S-BFD Discriminator TLV in the \"OSPF Router\n   Information\
