- title: 1.2 Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2 Terminology\n   The following are general terms are used in this document:\n\
    \   Backhaul:\n   Backhaul refers to the transport of signaling from the point\
    \ of\n   interface for the associated data stream (i.e., SG function in the\n\
    \   MGU) back to the point of call processing (i.e., the MGCU), if this\n   is\
    \ not local.\n   Signaling Transport (SIG):\n   SIG refers to a protocol stack\
    \ for transport of SCN signaling\n   protocols over an IP network. It will support\
    \ standard primitives to\n   interface with an unmodified SCN signaling application\
    \ being\n   transported, and supplements a standard IP transport protocol\n  \
    \ underneath with functions designed to meet transport requirements for\n   SCN\
    \ signaling.\n   Switched Circuit Network (SCN):\n   The term SCN is used to refer\
    \ to a network that carries traffic\n   within channelized bearers of pre-defined\
    \ sizes.  Examples include\n   Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTNs) and\
    \ Public Land Mobile\n   Networks (PLMNs).  Examples of signaling protocols used\
    \ in SCN\n   include Q.931, SS7 MTP Level 3 and SS7 Application/User parts.\n\
    \   The following are terms for functional entities relating to signaling\n  \
    \ transport in a distributed gateway model.\n   Media Gateway (MG):\n   A MG terminates\
    \ SCN media streams, packetizes the media data,, if it\n   is not already packetized,\
    \ and delivers packetized traffic  to the\n   packet network.  It performs these\
    \ functions in reverse order for\n   media streams flowing from the packet network\
    \ to the SCN.\n   Media Gateway Controller (MGC):\n   An MGC handles the registration\
    \ and management of resources at the\n   MG. The MGC may have the ability to authorize\
    \ resource usage based on\n   local policy.  For signaling transport purposes,\
    \ the MGC serves as a\n   possible termination and origination point for SCN application\n\
    \   protocols, such as SS7 ISDN User Part and Q.931/DSS1.\n   Signaling Gateway\
    \ (SG):\n   An SG is a signaling agent that receives/sends SCN native signaling\n\
    \   at the edge of the IP network. The SG function may relay, translate\n   or\
    \ terminate SS7 signaling in an SS7-Internet Gateway. The SG\n   function may\
    \ also be co-resident with the MG function to process SCN\n   signaling associated\
    \ with line or trunk terminations controlled by\n   the MG (e.g., signaling backhaul).\n\
    \   The following are terms for physical entities relating to signaling\n   transport\
    \ in a distributed gateway model:\n   Media Gateway Unit (MGU)\n   An MG-Unit\
    \ is a physical entity that contains the MG function.  It\n   may contain other\
    \ functions, esp. an SG function for handling\n   facility-associated signaling.\n\
    \   Media Gateway Control Unit (MGCU)\n   An MGC-Unit is a physical entity containing\
    \ the MGC function.\n   Signaling Gateway Unit (SGU)\n   An SG-Unit is a physical\
    \ entity containing the SG function.\n   Signaling End Point (SEP):\n   This is\
    \ a node in an SS7 network that originates or terminates\n   signaling messages.\
    \  One example is a central office switch.\n   Signal Transfer Point (STP):\n\
    \   This is a node in an SS7 network that routes signaling messages based\n  \
    \ on their destination point code in the SS7 network.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.3  Scope\n   Signaling transport provides transparent transport of message-based\n\
    \   signaling protocols over IP networks.   The scope of this work\n   includes\
    \ definition of encapsulation methods, end-to-end protocol\n   mechanisms and\
    \ use of IP capabilities to support the functional and\n   performance requirements\
    \ for signaling.\n   Signaling transport shall be used for transporting SCN signaling\n\
    \   between a Signaling Gateway Unit and Media Gateway Controller Unit.\n   Signaling\
    \ transport may also be used for transport of message-based\n   signaling between\
    \ a Media Gateway Unit and Media Gateway Controller\n   Unit, between dispersed\
    \ Media Gateway Controller Units, and between\n   two Signaling Gateway Units\
    \ connecting signaling endpoints or signal\n   transfer points in the SCN.\n \
    \  Signaling transport will be defined in such a way as to support\n   encapsulation\
    \ and carriage of a variety of SCN protocols.  It is\n   defined in such a way\
    \ as to be independent of any SCN protocol\n   translation functions taking place\
    \ at the endpoints of the signaling\n   transport, since its function is limited\
    \ to the transport of the SCN\n   protocol.\n   Since the function being provided\
    \ is transparent transport, the\n   following areas are considered outside the\
    \ scope of the signaling\n   transport work:\n   -  definition of the SCN protocols\
    \ themselves.\n   -  signaling interworking such as conversion from Channel Associated\n\
    \      Signaling (CAS) to message signaling protocols.\n   -  specification of\
    \ the functions taking place within the SGU or MGU\n   -  in particular, this\
    \ work does not address whether the SGU provides\n      mediation/interworking,\
    \ as this is transparent to the transport\n      function.\n   -  similarly, some\
    \ management and addressing functions taking place\n      within the SGU or MGU\
    \ are also considered out of scope, such as\n      determination of the destination\
    \ IP address for signaling, or\n      specific procedures for assessing the performance\
    \ of the transport\n      session (i.e., testing and proving functions).\n"

  - "2.2  SS7 Interworking for Connection Control\n   Figure 2 below shows some example\
    \ implementations of these functions\n   in physical entities as used for interworking\
    \ of SS7 and IP networks\n   for Voice over IP, Voice over ATM, Network Access\
    \ Servers, etc.  No\n   recommendation is made as to functional distribution and\
    \ many other\n   examples are possible but are not shown to be concise.  The use\
    \ of\n   signaling transport is independent of the implementation.\n   For interworking\
    \ with SS7-controlled SCN networks, the SG terminates\n   the SS7 link and transfers\
    \ the signaling information to the MGC using\n   signaling transport.  The MG\
    \ terminates the interswitch trunk and\n   controls the trunk based on the control\
    \ signaling it receives from\n   the MGC. As shown below in case (a), the SG,\
    \ MGC and MG may be\n   implemented in separate physical units, or as in case\
    \ (b), the MGC\n   and MG may be implemented in a single physical unit.\n   In\
    \ alternative case (c), a facility-associated SS7 link is terminated\n   by the\

- title: 4.1 Transport of SCN Signaling Protocols
  contents:
  - "4.1 Transport of SCN Signaling Protocols\n   Signaling transport provides for\
    \ the transport of native SCN protocol\n   messages over a packet switched network.\n\
    \   Signaling transport shall:\n   1) Transport of a variety of SCN protocol types,\
    \ such as the\n   application and user parts of SS7 (including MTP Level 3, ISUP,\
    \ SCCP,\n   TCAP, MAP, INAP, IS-41, etc.) and layer 3 of the DSS1/PSS1 protocols\n\
    \   (i.e. Q.931 and QSIG).\n   2) Provide a means to identify the particular SCN\
    \ protocol being\n   transported.\n   3) Provide a common base protocol defining\
    \ header formats, security\n   extensions and procedures for signaling transport,\
    \ and support\n   extensions as necessary to add individual SCN protocols if and\
    \ when\n   required.\n   4) In conjunction with the underlying network protocol\
    \ (IP), provide\n   the relevant functionality as defined by the appropriate SCN\
    \ lower\n   layer.\n   Relevant functionality may include (according to the protocol\
    \ being\n   transported):\n   -  flow control\n   -  in sequence delivery of signaling\
    \ messages within a control stream\n   -  logical identification of the entities\
    \ on which the signaling\n      messages originate or terminate\n   -  logical\
    \ identification of the physical interface controlled by the\n      signaling\
    \ message\n   -  error detection\n   -  recovery from failure of components in\
    \ the transit path\n   -  retransmission and other error correcting methods\n\
    \   -  detection of unavailability of peer entities.\n   For example:\n   -  if\
    \ the native SCN protocol is ISUP or SCCP, the relevant\n      functionality provided\
    \ by MTP2/3 shall be provided.\n   -  if the native SCN protocol is TCAP, the\
    \ relevant functionality\n      provided by SCCP connectionless classes and MTP\
    \ 2/3 shall be\n      supported.\n   -  if the native SCN protocol is Q.931, the\
    \ relevant functionality\n      provided by Q.921 shall be supported.\n   -  if\
    \ the native SCN protocol is MTP3, the relevant functionality of\n      MTP2 shall\
    \ be supported.\n   5) Support the ability to multiplex several higher layer SCN\
    \ sessions\n   on one underlying signaling transport session.  This allows, for\n\
    \   example, several DSS1 D-Channel sessions to be carried in one\n   signaling\
    \ transport session.\n   In general, in-sequence delivery is required for signaling\
    \ messages\n   within a single control stream, but is not necessarily required\
    \ for\n   messages that belong to different control streams.  The protocol\n \
    \  should if possible take advantage of this property to avoid blocking\n   delivery\
    \ of messages in one control stream due to sequence error\n   within another control\
    \ stream.  The protocol should also allow the SG\n   to send different control\
    \ streams to different destination ports if\n   desired.\n   6) Be able to transport\
    \ complete messages of greater length than the\n   underlying SCN segmentation/reassembly\
    \ limitations.  For example,\n   signaling transport should not be constrained\
    \ by the length\n   limitations defined for SS7 lower layer protocol (e.g. 272\
    \ bytes in\n   the case of narrowband SS7) but should be capable of carrying longer\n\
    \   messages without requiring segmentation.\n   7) Allow for a range of suitably\
    \ robust security schemes to protect\n   signaling information being carried across\
    \ networks. For example,\n   signaling transport shall be able to operate over\
    \ proxyable sessions,\n   and be able to be transported through firewalls.\n \
    \  8) Provide for congestion avoidance on the Internet, by supporting\n   appropriate\
    \ controls on signaling traffic generation (including\n   signaling generated\
    \ in SCN) and reaction to network congestion.\n"

    \ Timer Requirements\n      -  one example of ISUP timer requirements is the Continuity\
    \ Test\n         procedure, which requires that a tone generated at the sending\n\
    \         end be returned from the receiving end within 2 seconds of\n       \
    \  sending an IAM indicating continuity test.  This implies that\n         one\

    \ need to be accomplished within 2 seconds.\n      ISUP Message Delay - End-to-End\
    \ Requirements\n      -  the requirement for end-to-end call setup delay in ISUP\
    \ is that\n         an end-to-end response message be received within 20-30 seconds\n\
    \         of the sending of the IAM.  Note: while this is the protocol\n     \

  contents:
  - "6.1 Security Requirements\n   When SCN related signaling is transported over\
    \ an IP network two\n   possible network scenarios can be distinguished:\n   -\
    \  Signaling transported only within an Intranet;\n      Security measures are\
    \ applied at the discretion of the network\n      owner.\n   -  Signaling transported,\
    \ at least to some extent, in the public\n      Internet;\n      The public Internet\
    \ should be regarded generally as an \"insecure\"\n      network and usage of\
    \ security measures is  required.\n   Generally security comprises several aspects\n\
    \   -  Authentication:\n      It is required to ensure that the information is\
    \ sent to/from a\n      known and trusted partner.\n   -  Integrity:\n      It\
    \ is required to ensure that the information hasn't been modified\n      while\
    \ in transit.\n   -  Confidentiality:\n      It might be sometimes required to\
    \ ensure that the transported\n      information is encrypted to avoid illegal\
    \ use.\n   -  Availability:\n      It is required that the communicating endpoints\
    \ remain in service\n      for authorized use even if under attack.\n"
- title: 6.2 Security Mechanisms Currently Available in IP Networks
  contents:
  - "6.2 Security Mechanisms Currently Available in IP Networks\n   Several security\
    \ mechanisms are currently available for use in IP\n   networks.\n   -  IPSEC\
    \ ([RFC2401]):\n      IPSEC provides security services at the IP layer that address\
    \ the\n      above mentioned requirements. It defines the two protocols AH and\n\
    \      ESP respectively that essentially provide data integrity and data\n   \
    \   confidentiality services.\n      The ESP mechanism can be used in two different\
    \ modes:\n      - Transport mode;\n      - Tunnel mode.\n   In Transport mode\
    \ IPSEC protects the higher layer protocol data\n   portion of an IP packet, while\
    \ in Tunnel mode a complete IP packet is\n   encapsulated in a secure IP tunnel.\n\
    \   If the SIG embeds any IP addresses outside of the SA/DA in the IP\n   header,\
    \ passage through a NAT function will cause problems. The same\n   is true for\
    \ using IPsec in general, unless an IPsec ready RSIP\n   function is used as described\
    \ in RFC 2663 [NAT].\n   The use of IPSEC does not hamper the use of TCP or UDP\
    \ as the\n   underlying basis of SIG.  If automated distribution of keys is\n\
    \   required the IKE protocol ([RFC2409]) can be applied.\n   -  SSL, TLS ([RFC2246]):\n\
    \      SSL and TLS also provide appropriate security services but operate\n  \
    \    on top of TCP/IP only.\n   It is not required to define new security mechanisms\
    \ in SIG, as the\n   use of currently available mechanisms is sufficient to provide\
    \ the\n   necessary security.  It is recommended that IPSEC or some equivalent\n\
    \   method be used, especially when transporting SCN signaling over\n   public\
    \ Internet.\n"
