  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies how Label Edge Routers (LERs) should behave\n
    \  when determining whether to MPLS encapsulate an IPv4 packet with\n   header
    options.  Lack of a formal standard has resulted in different\n   LER forwarding
    behaviors for IPv4 packets with header options despite\n   being associated with
    a prefix-based Forwarding Equivalence Class\n   (FEC).  IPv4 option packets that
    belong to a prefix-based FEC, yet\n   are forwarded into an IPv4/MPLS network
    without being MPLS-\n   encapsulated, present a security risk against the MPLS\n
    \  infrastructure.  Further, LERs that are unable to MPLS encapsulate\n   IPv4
    packets with header options cannot operate in certain MPLS\n   environments.  While
    this newly defined LER behavior is mandatory to\n   implement, it is optional
    to invoke.\n"

    \  encapsulation processing of IPv4 packets with header options in order\n   to
    mitigate the existing risks of IPv4 options-based security attacks\n   against
    MPLS infrastructures.  We believe that this document adds\n   details that have
    not been fully addressed in [RFC3031] and\n   [RFC3032], and that the methods
    presented in this document update\n   [RFC3031] as well as complement [RFC3270],
    [RFC3443], and [RFC4950].\n"
  title: 1.  Motivation

  - "2.  Introduction\n   The IPv4 packet header provides for various IPv4 options
    as\n   originally specified in [RFC791].  IPv4 header options are used to\n   enable
    control functions within the IPv4 data forwarding plane that\n   are required
    in some specific situations but not necessary for most\n   common IPv4 communications.
    \ Typical IPv4 header options include\n   provisions for timestamps, security,
    and special routing.  Example\n   IPv4 header options and applications include
    but are not limited to\n   the following:\n      o Strict and Loose Source Route
    Options: Used to IPv4 route the\n        IPv4 packet based on information supplied
    by the source.\n      o Record Route Option: Used to trace the route an IPv4 packet\n
    \       takes.\n      o Router Alert Option: Indicates to downstream IPv4 routers
    to\n        examine these IPv4 packets more closely.\n   The list of current IPv4
    header options can be accessed at [IANA].\n   IPv4 packets may or may not use
    IPv4 header options (they are\n   optional), but IPv4 header option handling mechanisms
    must be\n   implemented by all IPv4 protocol stacks (hosts and routers).  Each\n
    \  IPv4 header option has distinct header fields and lengths.  IPv4\n   options
    extend the IPv4 packet header length beyond the minimum of 20\n   octets.  As
    a result, IPv4 packets received with header options are\n   typically handled
    as exceptions and in a less efficient manner due to\n   their variable length
    and complex processing requirements.  For\n   example, many router implementations
    punt such IPv4 option packets\n   from the hardware forwarding (fast) path into
    the software forwarding\n   (slow) path causing high CPU utilization.  Even when
    the forwarding\n   plane can parse a variable-length header, it may still need
    to punt\n   to the control plane because the forwarding plane may not have the\n
    \  clock cycles or intelligence required to process the header option.\n   Multi-Protocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) [RFC3031] is a technology in\n   which packets associated
    with a prefix-based Forwarding Equivalence\n   Class (FEC) are encapsulated with
    a label stack and then switched\n   along a label switched path (LSP) by a sequence
    of label switch\n   routers (LSRs).  These intermediate LSRs do not generally
    perform any\n   processing of the IPv4 header as packets are forwarded. (There
    are\n   some exceptions to this rule, such as ICMP processing and LSP ping,\n
    \  as described in [RFC3032] and [RFC4379], respectively.)  Many MPLS\n   deployments
    rely on LSRs to provide layer 3 transparency much like\n   ATM switches are transparent
    at layer 2.  Such deployments often\n   minimize the IPv4 routing information
    (e.g., no BGP transit routes)\n   carried by LSRs since it is not necessary for
    MPLS forwarding of\n   transit packets.\n   Even though MPLS encapsulation seems
    to offer a viable solution to\n   provide layer 3 transparency, there is currently
    no formal standard\n   for MPLS encapsulation of IPv4 packets with header options
    that\n   belong to a prefix-based FEC.  Lack of a formal standard has resulted\n
    \  in inconsistent forwarding behaviors by ingress Label Edge Routers\n   (LERs).
    \ When IPv4 packets are MPLS encapsulated by an ingress LER,\n   for example,
    the IPv4 header including option fields of transit\n   packets are not acted upon
    by downstream LSRs that forward based on\n   the MPLS label(s).  Conversely, when
    a packet is IPv4 forwarded by an\n   ingress LER two undesirable behaviors can
    result.  First, a\n   downstream LSR may not have sufficient IPv4 routing information
    to\n   forward the packet resulting in packet loss.  Second, downstream LSRs\n
    \  must apply IPv4 forwarding rules that may expose them to IPv4\n   security
    attacks.\n   IPv4 option packets that belong to a prefix-based FEC, yet are\n
    \  forwarded into an IPv4/MPLS network without being MPLS-encapsulated,\n   present
    a security risk against the MPLS infrastructure.  Further,\n   LERs that are unable
    to MPLS encapsulate IPv4 packets with header\n   options cannot operate as an
    LER in certain MPLS environments.  This\n   new requirement will reduce the risk
    of IPv4 options-based security\n   attacks against LSRs as well as assist LER
    operation across MPLS\n   networks that minimize the IPv4 routing information
    (e.g., no BGP\n   transit routes) carried by LSRs.\n"

  title: 3.  Specification of Requirements
- contents:
  - "4.  Ingress Label Edge Router Requirement\n   An ingress LER MUST implement the
    following policy:\n      o When determining whether to push an MPLS label stack
    onto an\n        IPv4 packet, the determination is made without considering any\n
    \       IPv4 options that may be carried in the IPv4 packet header.\n        Further,
    the label values that appear in the label stack are\n        determined without
    considering any such IPv4 options.\n   This policy MAY be configurable on an ingress
    LER, however, it SHOULD\n   be enabled by default.  When processing of signaling
    messages or data\n   packets with more specific forwarding rules is enabled, this
    policy\n   SHOULD NOT alter the specific processing rules.  This applies to, but\n
    \  is not limited to, Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) as per\n   [RFC2205],
    source routing as per [RFC791], as well as other FEC\n   elements defined by future
    specifications.  Further, how an ingress\n   LER processes the IPv4 header options
    of packets before MPLS\n   encapsulation is out of scope since these are processed
    before they\n   enter the MPLS domain.\n   Implementation of the above policy
    prevents IPv4 packets that belong\n   to a prefix-based FEC from bypassing MPLS
    encapsulation due to header\n   options.  The policy also prevents specific option
    types such as\n   Router Alert (option value 148) from forcing MPLS imposition
    of the\n   MPLS Router Alert Label (label value 1) at ingress LERs.  Without\n
    \  this policy, the MPLS infrastructure is exposed to security attacks\n   using
    legitimate IPv4 packets crafted with header options.  Further,\n   LERs that are
    unable to MPLS encapsulate IPv4 packets with header\n   options cannot operate
    as an LER in certain MPLS environments as\n   described in Section 2.\n"
  title: 4.  Ingress Label Edge Router Requirement
- contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   There are two potential categories of attacks
    using crafted IPv4\n   option packets that threaten existing MPLS infrastructures.
    \ Both are\n   described below.  To mitigate the risk of these specific attacks,
    the\n   ingress LER policy specified above is required.\n"
  - contents:
    - "5.1.  IPv4 Option Packets That Bypass MPLS Encapsulation\n   Given that a router's
      exception handling process (i.e., CPU,\n   processor line-card bandwidth, etc.)
      used for IPv4 header option\n   processing is often shared with IPv4 control
      and management protocol\n   router resources, a flood of IPv4 packets with header
      options may\n   adversely affect a router's control and management protocols,\n
      \  thereby, triggering a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.  Note, IPv4\n   packets
      with header options may be valid transit IPv4 packets with\n   legitimate sources
      and destinations.  Hence, a DoS-like condition may\n   be triggered on downstream
      transit IPv4 routers that lack protection\n   mechanisms even in the case of
      legitimate IPv4 option packets.\n   IPv4 option packets that belong to a prefix-based
      FEC yet bypass MPLS\n   encapsulation at an ingress LER may be inadvertently
      IPv4 routed\n   downstream across the MPLS core network (not label switched).
      \ This\n   allows an external attacker the opportunity to maliciously craft\n
      \  seemingly legitimate IPv4 packets with specific IPv4 header options\n   in
      order to intentionally bypass MPLS encapsulation at the MPLS edge\n   (i.e.,
      ingress LER) and trigger a DoS condition on downstream LSRs.\n   Some of the
      specific types of IPv4 option-based security attacks that\n   may be leveraged
      against MPLS networks include the following:\n      o Crafted IPv4 option packets
      that belong to a prefix-based FEC\n        yet bypass MPLS encapsulation at
      an ingress LER may allow an\n        attacker to DoS downstream LSRs by saturating
      their software\n        forwarding paths.  By targeting a LSR's exception path,
      control\n        and management protocols may be adversely affected and, thereby,\n
      \       an LSR's availability.  This assumes, of course, that downstream\n        LSRs
      lack protection mechanisms.\n      o Crafted IPv4 option packets that belong
      to a prefix-based FEC\n        yet bypass MPLS encapsulation at an ingress LER
      may allow for\n        IPv4 Time to Live (TTL) expiry-based DoS attacks against\n
      \       downstream LSRs.  MPLS enables IPv4 core hiding whereby transit\n        IPv4
      traffic flows see the MPLS network as a single router hop\n        [RFC3443].
      \ However, MPLS core hiding does not apply to packets\n        that bypass MPLS
      encapsulation and, therefore, IPv4 option\n        packets may be crafted to
      expire on downstream LSRs which may\n        trigger a DoS condition.  Bypassing
      MPLS core hiding is an\n        additional security consideration since it exposes
      the network\n        topology.\n      o Crafted IPv4 option packets that belong
      to a prefix-based FEC\n        yet bypass MPLS encapsulation at an ingress LER
      may allow for\n        DoS attacks against downstream LSRs that do not carry
      the IPv4\n        routing information required to forward transit IPv4 traffic.\n
      \       Lack of such IPv4 routing information may prevent legitimate\n        IPv4
      option packets from transiting the MPLS network and,\n        further, may trigger
      generation of ICMP destination unreachable\n        messages, which could lead
      to a DoS condition.  This assumes, of\n        course, that downstream LSRs
      lack protection mechanisms and do\n        not carry the IPv4 routing information
      required to forward\n        transit traffic.\n      o Crafted IPv4 option packets
      that belong to a prefix-based FEC\n        yet bypass MPLS encapsulation at
      an ingress LER may allow an\n        attacker to bypass LSP Diffserv tunnels
      [RFC3270] and any\n        associated MPLS Class of Service (CoS) field [RFC5462]
      marking\n        policies at ingress LERs and, thereby, adversely affect (i.e.,\n
      \       DoS) high-priority traffic classes within the MPLS core.\n        Further,
      this could also lead to theft of high-priority services\n        by unauthorized
      parties.  This assumes, of course, that the\n        [RFC3270] Pipe model is
      deployed within the MPLS core.\n      o Crafted RSVP packets that belong to
      a prefix-based FEC yet\n        bypass MPLS encapsulation at an ingress LER
      may allow an\n        attacker to build RSVP soft-states [RFC2205] [RFC3209]
      on\n        downstream LSRs which could lead to theft of service by\n        unauthorized
      parties or to a DoS condition caused by locking up\n        LSR resources.  This
      assumes, of course, that the MPLS network\n        is enabled to process RSVP
      packets.\n   The security attacks outlined above specifically apply to IPv4
      option\n   packets that belong to a prefix-based FEC yet bypass ingress LER\n
      \  label stack imposition.  Additionally, these attacks only apply to\n   IPv4
      option packets forwarded using the global routing table (i.e.,\n   IPv4 address
      family) of a ingress LER.  IPv4 option packets\n   associated with a BGP/MPLS
      IPv4 VPN service are always MPLS\n   encapsulated by the ingress LER per [RFC4364]
      given that packet\n   forwarding uses a Virtual Forwarding/Routing (VRF) instance.\n
      \  Therefore, BGP/MPLS IPv4 VPN services are not subject to the threats\n   outlined
      above [RFC4381].  Further, IPv6 [RFC2460] makes use of\n   extension headers
      not header options and is therefore outside the\n   scope of this document.
      \ A separate security threat that does apply\n   to both BGP/MPLS IPv4 VPNs
      and the IPv4 address family makes use of\n   the Router Alert Label.  This is
      described directly below.\n"

  - contents:
    - "5.2.  Router Alert Label Imposition\n   [RFC3032] defines a Router Alert Label
      (label value of 1), which is\n   analogous to the Router Alert IPv4 header option
      (option value of\n   148).  The MPLS Router Alert Label (when exposed and processed
      only)\n   indicates to downstream LSRs to examine these MPLS packets more\n
      \  closely.  MPLS packets with the MPLS Router Alert Label are also\n   handled
      as an exception by LSRs and, again, in a less efficient\n   manner.  At the
      time of this writing, the only legitimate use of the\n   Router Alert Label
      is for LSP ping/trace [RFC4379].  Since there is\n   also no formal standard
