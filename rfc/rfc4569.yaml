  - "Abstract\n   This document registers with the IANA a new media feature tag\n\
    \   associated with the 'message' media type.  This media feature tag\n   indicates\
    \ that a particular device supports 'message' as a streaming\n   media type. \
    \ Media feature tags can be used to route calls to devices\n   that support certain\
    \ features.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) specification [5]\
    \ defines a\n   number of media types.  RFC 3840 [4] registers with the IANA media\n\
    \   feature tags associated with all those media types except for the\n   'message'\
    \ media type.  This document registers a new media feature\n   tag that is associated\
    \ with the 'message' media type.\n   The reason why the 'message' media feature\
    \ tag was not registered by\n   RFC 3840 was that when RFC 3840 was published,\
    \ the SDP specification\n   was RFC 2327 [1].  RFC 3840 defined media feature\
    \ tags for all the\n   media types defined by RFC 2327.  However, RFC 2327 did\
    \ not define\n   the 'message' media type.  This media type was defined by the\
    \ revised\n   SDP specification [5], which was published after RFC 3840.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Security Considerations\n   Section 11.1 of RFC 3840 [4] discusses security\
    \ considerations\n   related to the use of media feature tags.\n"
- title: 3.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   This specification registers a new media feature\
    \ tag in the SIP [3]\n   tree per the procedures defined in RFC 2506 [2] and RFC\
    \ 3840 [4].\n      Media feature tag name: sip.message\n      ASN.1 Identifier:\
    \ 21\n      Summary of the media feature indicated by this tag: This feature\n\
    \      tag indicates that the device supports message as a streaming\n      media\
    \ type.\n      Values appropriate for use with this feature tag: Boolean.\n  \
    \    The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following\n      applications,\
    \ protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms: This\n      feature tag is most\
    \ useful in a communications application for\n      describing the capabilities\
    \ of a device, such as a phone or PDA.\n      Examples of typical use: Routing\
    \ a call to a phone that can\n      support session-based instant messaging.\n\
    \      Related standards or documents: RFC 4569.\n      Security Considerations:\
    \ Security considerations for this media\n      feature tag are discussed in Section\
    \ 11.1 of RFC 3840.\n"
