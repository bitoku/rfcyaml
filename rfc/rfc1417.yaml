  - "1.  Introduction\n   The North American Directory Forum (NADF) is a collection\
    \ of service\n   providers which plans to cooperatively offer a Public Directory\n\
    \   Service in North America using the CCITT X.500 Recommendations.\n   Although\
    \ many groups are working on realizing X.500, the NADF is\n   unique in that it\
    \ must achieve a cooperative service offered by\n   competing providers.\n   The\
    \ purpose of this document is to provide a brief overview of the\n   NADF's Standing\
    \ Document series.  As of this writing, the standing\n   documents are:\n    \
    \            No                           Title\n               ----    ------------------------------------------------\n\

    \        SD-12   Registry of ADDMD Names\n   SD-1 defines the scope of the NADF,\
    \ whilst SD-2 describes issue of\n   interest to the NADF.\n   The remaining documents\
    \ describe the agreements necessary to achieve\n   a cooperative Public Directory\
    \ Service offered by competing\n   providers.  In this context, it should be observed\
    \ that the NADF\n   relies on X.500(88) to the largest extent possible.\n   SD-3\
    \ contains agreements concerning the Directory \"service\", e.g.,\n   quality\
    \ of service, whilst SD-4 contains agreements concerning the\n   Directory schema.\n\
    \   SD-5 concerns itself with how a national authority should structure\n   its\
    \ DIT subtree, and then applies these principles to define the\n   naming scheme\
    \ for the c=CA and c=US parts of the DIT.  The NADF's\n   approach is to divide\
    \ a national DIT subtree into two portions: the\n   public name-space, which corresponds\
    \ to information objects having\n   some sort of public recognition (e.g., states,\
    \ counties, businesses,\n   etc.), and several private name-spaces, each unilaterally\
    \ managed by\n   a public provider of Directory services.  (SD-12 defines the\
    \ registry\n   of these providers.) Based on the civil standing of an entity,\
    \ that\n   entity may opt to list as one or more entries in the public name-\n\
    \   space.  That is, registration, per se, occurs outside of the\n   Directory.\
    \  This is an important concept as it allows an entity to\n   list where others\
    \ are likely to search.\n   SD-6 provides guidelines as to how organizations might\
    \ wish to\n   organize their private name-space, and also discusses how multi-\n\
    \   nationals might choose to list themselves.\n   SD-7 contains agreements concerning\
    \ how the DIT is mapped onto\n   multiple DMDs.  Knowledge maintenance procedures\
    \ are absent from\n   X.500(88), and products which support X.500(92) are years\
    \ away.\n   Further, the competitive relationships between the North American\n\
    \   Directory providers invalidate any possibility of a single entity\n   having\
    \ exclusive management rights to the public name-space.  The\n   NADF approach\
    \ is to cooperatively manage the public name-space by\n   allowing each service\
    \ provider to provide linkage from the public\n   name-space into their own private\
    \ name-space.  This information is\n   limited to knowledge references and naming\
    \ links; there is little, if\n   any, payload present.  SD-9 discusses how a central\
    \ authority (termed\n   the CAN) coordinates and disseminates this information.\
    \  In effect,\n   the CAN publishes a roadmap for North American Public Directory\n\
    \   Service.\n   SD-8 describes agreements reached for the NADF Pilot.\n   SD-10\
    \ describes the NADF policy toward security and privacy.\n   Attachment 1 of SD-10\
    \ contains the \"User Bill of Rights for entries\n   and listings in the Public\
    \ Directory\".  In contrast, SD-11 describes\n   the security facilities available\
    \ in the Directory, and then\n   specifies which mechanisms which will be used\
    \ in the Public Directory\n   service.\n"

  - "1.1.  Document Availability\n   At the present time, the NADF standing documents\
    \ are available only\n   in hardcopy and PostScript form.  Since they do not exist\
    \ in ASCII\n   form, the NADF standing documents can not be distributed as\n \
