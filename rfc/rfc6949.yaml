- title: 1  Introduction

  - "1  Introduction\n   Over 40 years ago, the RFC Series began as a collection of\
    \ memos in\n   an environment that included handwritten RFCs, typewritten RFCs,\
    \ RFCs\n   produced on mainframes with complicated layout tools, and more.  As\n\
    \   the tools changed and some of the source formats became unreadable,\n   the\
    \ core individuals behind the Series realized that a common format\n   that could\
    \ be read, revised, and archived long in the future was\n   required.  US-ASCII\
    \ was chosen for the encoding of characters, and\n   after a period of variability,\
    \ a well-defined presentation format was\n   settled upon.  That format has proved\
    \ to be persistent and reliable\n   across a large variety of devices, operating\
    \ systems, and editing\n   tools.  That stability has been a continuing strength\
    \ of the Series.\n   However, as new technology, such as small devices and advances\
    \ in\n   display technology, comes into common usage, there is a growing\n   desire\
    \ to see the format of the RFC Series adapt to take advantage of\n   these different\
    \ ways to communicate information.\n   Since the format stabilized, authors and\
    \ readers have suggested\n   enhancements to the format.  However, no suggestion\
    \ developed clear\n   consensus in the Internet technical community.  As always,\
    \ some\n   individuals see no need for change, while others press strongly for\n\
    \   specific enhancements.\n   This document takes a look at the current requirements\
    \ for RFCs as\n   described in RFC 2223 [RFC2223] and more recently in 2223bis\n\
    \   [2223bis].  Section 2 reviews recent requests for enhancements as\n   understood\
    \ from community discussion and various proposals for new\n   formats including\
    \ HTML, XML, PDF, and EPUB.  The actual requirements\n   are then captured in\
    \ Section 3.  The focus of this document is on the\n   Canonical format of RFCs,\
    \ but some mention of other phases in the RFC\n   publication process and the\
    \ document formats associated with these\n   phases is also included.  Terms are\
    \ defined to help clarify exactly\n   which stages of document production are\
    \ under discussion for format\n   changes.\n"

- title: 2.  History and Goals
  contents:
  - "2.  History and Goals\n   Below are the current RFC format rules as defined in\
    \ [RFC2223] and\n   clarified in 2223bis.\n      *  The character codes are ASCII.\n\
    \      *  Each page must be limited to 58 lines followed by a form feed\n    \
    \     on a line by\n            itself.\n      *  Each line must be limited to\
    \ 72 characters followed by carriage\n         return and line feed.\n      *\
    \  No overstriking (or underlining) is allowed.\n      *  These \"height\" and\
    \ \"width\" constraints include any headers,\n         footers, page numbers,\
    \ or left-side indenting.\n      *  Do not fill the text with extra spaces to\
    \ provide a straight\n         right margin.\n      *  Do not do hyphenation of\
    \ words at the right margin.\n      *  Do not use footnotes.  If such notes are\
    \ necessary, put them at\n         the end of a section, or at the end of the\
    \ document.\n      *  Use single spaced text within a paragraph, and one blank\
    \ line\n         between paragraphs.\n      *  Note that the number of pages in\
    \ a document and the page\n         numbers on which various sections fall will\
    \ likely change with\n         reformatting.  Thus, cross-references in the text\
    \ by section\n         number usually are easier to keep consistent than cross-\n\
    \         references by page number.\n      *  RFCs in plain ASCII text may be\
    \ submitted to the RFC Editor in\n         e-mail messages (or as online files)\
    \ in either the finished\n         Publication format or in nroff.  If you plan\
    \ to submit a\n         document in nroff please consult the RFC Editor first.\n\
    \   The precedent for additional formats, specifically PostScript, is\n   described\
    \ in RFC 2223 and has been used for a small number of RFCs:\n      Note that since\
    \ the ASCII text version of the RFC is the primary\n      version, the PostScript\
    \ version must match the text version.  The\n      RFC Editor must decide if the\
    \ PostScript version is \"the same as\"\n      the ASCII version before the PostScript\
    \ version can be published.\n   Neither RFC 2223 nor 2223bis uses the term 'metadata',\
    \ though the RFC\n   Editor currently refers to components of the text such as\
    \ the Stream,\n   Status (e.g., Updates, Obsoletes), Category, and ISSN as 'metadata'.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Issues Driving Change
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Issues Driving Change\n   While some authors and readers of RFCs report\
    \ that they find the\n   strict limits of character encoding, line limits, and\
    \ so on to be\n   acceptable, others claim to find those limitations a significant\n\
    \   obstacle to their desire to communicate and read the information via\n   an\
    \ RFC.  With a broader community of authors currently producing RFCs\n   and a\
    \ wider range of presentation devices in use, the issues being\n   reported by\
    \ the community indicate limitations of the current\n   Canonical format that\
    \ must be reviewed and potentially addressed in\n   the Canonical RFC format.\n\
    \   While the specific points of concern vary, the main issues discussed\n   are:\n\
    \      *  ASCII art\n      *  Character encoding\n      *  Pagination\n      *\
    \  Reflowable text\n      *  Metadata\n   Each area of concern has people in favor\
    \ of change and people opposed\n   to it, all with reasonable concerns and requirements.\
    \  Below is a\n   summary of the arguments for and against each major issue. \
    \ These\n   points are not part of the list of requirements; they are the inputs\n\
    \   that informed the requirements discussed in Section 3 of this\n   document.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  ASCII Art
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  ASCII Art\n   Arguments in favor of limiting all diagrams, equations,\
    \ tables, and\n   charts to ASCII art depictions only include:\n      *  Dependence\
    \ on advanced diagrams (or any diagrams) causes\n         accessibility issues.\n\
    \      *  Requiring ASCII art results in people often relying more on\n      \
    \   clear written descriptions rather than just the diagram itself.\n      * \
    \ Use of the ASCII character set forces design of diagrams that\n         are\
    \ simple and concise.\n   Arguments in favor of allowing the use of more complex\
    \ diagrams in\n   place of the current use of ASCII art include:\n      *  State\
    \ diagrams with multiple arrows in different directions and\n         labels on\
    \ the lines will be more understandable.\n      *  Protocol flow diagrams in which\
    \ each step needs multiple lines\n         of description will be clearer.\n \
    \     *  Scenario descriptions that involve three or more parties with\n     \
    \    communication flows between them will be clearer.\n      *  Given the difficulties\
    \ in expressing complex equations with\n         common mathematical notation,\
    \ allowing graphic art would allow\n         equations to be displayed properly.\n\
    \      *  Complex art could allow for grayscale or color to be introduced\n  \
    \       into the diagrams.\n   Two suggestions have been proposed regarding how\
    \ graphics should be\n   included: one that would have graphic art referenced\
    \ as a separate\n   document to the Publication format, and one that would allow\
    \ embedded\n   graphics in the Publication format.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  Character Encoding
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Character Encoding\n   For most of the history of the RFC Series, the\
    \ character encoding for\n   RFCs has been ASCII.  Below are arguments for keeping\
    \ ASCII as well\n   as arguments for expanding to UTF-8.\n   Arguments for retaining\
    \ the ASCII-only requirement:\n      *  It is the most easy to search and display\
    \ across a variety of\n         platforms.\n      *  In extreme cases of having\
    \ to retype or scan hard copies of\n         documents (it has been required in\
    \ the past), ASCII is\n         significantly easier to work with for rescanning\
    \ and retaining\n         all of the original information.  There can be no loss\
    \ of\n         descriptive metadata such as keywords or content tags.\n      *\
    \  If we expand beyond ASCII, it will be difficult to know where\n         to\
    \ draw the line on which characters are and are not allowed.\n         There will\
    \ be issues with dependencies on local file systems\n         and processors being\
    \ configured to recognize any other\n         character set.\n      *  The IETF\
    \ works in ASCII (and English).  The Internet research,\n         design, and\
    \ development communities function almost entirely in\n         English.  That\
    \ strongly suggests that an ASCII document can be\n         properly rendered\
    \ and read by everyone in the communities and\n         audiences of interest.\n\
    \   Arguments for expanding to allow UTF-8:\n      *  In discussions of internationalization,\
    \ actually being able to\n         illustrate the issue is rather helpful, and\
    \ you can't\n         illustrate a Unicode code point with \"U+nnnn\".\n     \
    \ *  It will provide the ability to denote protocol examples using\n         the\
    \ character sets those examples support.\n      *  It will allow better support\
    \ for international character sets,\n         in particular, allowing authors\
    \ to spell their names in their\n         native character sets.\n      *  Certain\
    \ special characters in equations or quoted from other\n         texts could be\
    \ allowed.\n      *  Citations of web pages using more international characters\
    \ are\n         possible.\n   Arguments for strictly prescribed UTF-8 use:\n \
    \     *  In order to keep documents as searchable as possible, ASCII-\n      \
    \   only should be required for the main text of the document, and\n         some\
    \ broader UTF-8 character set allowed under clearly\n         prescribed circumstances\
    \ (e.g., author names and references).\n"
- title: 2.1.3.  Pagination
  contents:
  - "2.1.3.  Pagination\n   Arguments for continuing the use of discrete pages within\
    \ RFCs:\n      *  Ease of reference and printing; referring to section numbers\
    \ is\n         too coarse a method.\n   Arguments for removing the pagination\
    \ requirement:\n      *  Removing pagination will allow for a smoother reading\n\
    \         experience on a wider variety of devices, platforms, and\n         browsers.\n\
    \      *  Removing pagination results in people often using subsections\n    \
    \     rather than page number for reference purposes, forcing what\n         would\
    \ otherwise be long sections to be broken into subsections.\n         This would\
    \ encourage documents that are better organized and\n         simpler.\n"
- title: 2.1.4.  Reflowable Text
  contents:
  - "2.1.4.  Reflowable Text\n   Arguments against requiring text to be reflowable:\n\
    \      *  Reflowable text may impact the usability of graphics and tables\n  \
    \       within a document.\n   Arguments for requiring text to be reflowable:\n\
    \      *  RFCs are more readable on a wider variety of devices and\n         platforms,\
    \ including mobile devices and assorted screen\n         layouts.\n"
- title: 2.1.5.  Metadata and Tagging
  contents:
  - "2.1.5.  Metadata and Tagging\n   While metadata requirements are not part of\
    \ RFC 2223, there is a\n   request that descriptive metadata tags be added as\
    \ part of a revision\n   of the Canonical RFC format.  These tags would allow\
    \ for enhanced\n   content by embedding information such as links, tags, or quick\n\
    \   translations and could help control the look and feel of the\n   Publication\
    \ format.  While the lack of metadata in the current RFCs\n   does not impact\
    \ an RFC's accessibility or readability, several\n   individuals have indicated\
    \ that allowing metadata within the RFCs\n   would make their reading of the documents\
    \ more efficient.\n   Arguments for allowing metadata in the Canonical and Publication\n\
    \   formats:\n      *  Metadata potentially allows readers to get more detail\
    \ out of a\n         document.  For example, if non-ASCII characters are allowed\
    \ in\n         the Author's Address and Reference sections, metadata must\n  \
    \       include translations of that information.\n   Arguments against metadata\
    \ in the final Canonical and Publication\n   formats:\n      *  Metadata adds\
    \ additional overhead to the overall process of\n         creating RFCs and may\
    \ complicate future usability as a result\n         of requiring backward compatibility\
    \ for metadata tags.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Further Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Further Considerations\n   Some of the discussion beyond the issues described\
    \ above went into a\n   review of potential solutions.  Those solutions and the\
    \ debate around\n   them added a few more points to the list of potential requirements\n\
    \   for a change in RFC Format.  In particular, the discussion of tools\n   introduced\
    \ the idea of whether a change in format should also include\n   the creation\
    \ and ongoing support of specific RFC authoring and/or\n   rendering tools and\
    \ whether the Canonical format should be a format\n   that must go through a rendering\
    \ agent to be readable.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.  Creation and Use of RFC-Specific Tools
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Creation and Use of RFC-Specific Tools\n   Arguments in support of community-supported\
    \ RFC-specific tools:\n      *  Given the community that would be creating and\
    \ supporting these\n         tools, there would be greater control and flexibility\
    \ over the\n         tools and how they implement the RFC format requirements.\n\
    \      *  Community-supported tools currently exist and are in extensive\n   \
    \      use within the community, so it would be most efficient to\n         build\
    \ on that base.\n   Arguments against community-supported RFC-specific tools:\n\
    \      *  We cannot be so unique in our needs that we can't use\n         commercial\
    \ tools.\n      *  Ongoing support for these tools adds a greater level of\n \
    \        instability to the ongoing availability of the RFC Series\n         through\
    \ the decades.\n      *  The community that would support these tools cannot be\
    \ relied\n         on to be as stable and persistent as the Series itself.\n"
- title: 2.2.2.  Markup Language
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  Markup Language\n   Arguments in support of a markup language as the\
    \ Revisable format:\n      *  Having a markup language such as XML or HTML allows\
    \ for greater\n         flexibility in creating a variety of Publication formats,\
    \ with\n         a greater likelihood of similarity between them.\n   Arguments\
    \ against a markup language as the Revisable format:\n      *  Having the Revisable\
    \ format be in a markup language instead of\n         in a simple text-formatting\
    \ structure ties us in to specific\n         tools and/or tool support going forward.\n"
- title: 2.3.  RFC Editor Goals
  contents:
  - "2.3.  RFC Editor Goals\n   Currently, each RFC has an nroff file created prior\
    \ to publication.\n   For RFCs revised using an XML file, the nroff file is created\
    \ by\n   converting XML to nroff at the final step.  As more documents are\n \
    \  submitted with an XML file (of the RFCs published in 2012,\n   approximately\
    \ 65% were submitted with an XML file), this conversion\n   is problematic in\
    \ terms of time spent and data lost from XML.  Making\n   the publication process\
    \ for the RFC Editor more efficient is strongly\n   desired.\n"

    \   requirements may be added, and what requirements may be retired.\n   Detailed\
    \ rules regarding how these changes will be implemented will\n   be documented\
    \ in a future RFC.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Original Requirements to Be Retained
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Original Requirements to Be Retained\n   Several components of the original\
    \ format requirements must be\n   retained to ensure the ongoing continuity, reliability,\
    \ and\n   readability of the Series:\n      1.  The content of an RFC must not\
    \ change, regardless of format,\n          once published.\n      2.  The Canonical\
    \ format must be persistent and reliable across a\n          large variety of\

    \ the use of color.  See the W3C's\n          accessibility documents [WCAG20]\
    \ and the United Nations\n          \"Convention on the Rights of Persons with\
    \ Disabilities\"\n          [UN2006] for guidance.  Appropriate authoring tools\
    \ are highly\n          desirable but focus on the creation of Internet-Drafts,\
    \ a\n          topic outside the scope of the RFC Editor.\n      6.  The official\
    \ language of the RFC Series is English.  ASCII is\n          required for all\
    \ text that must be read to understand or\n          implement the technology\
    \ described in the RFC.  Use of non-\n          ASCII characters, expressed in\
    \ a standard Unicode Encoding\n          Form (such as UTF-8), must receive explicit\
    \ approval from the\n          document stream manager and will be allowed after\
    \ the rules\n          for the common use cases are defined in the Style Guide.\n\
    \      7.  The Submission and Publication formats need to permit\n          extending\
    \ the set of metadata tags, for the addition of\n          labeled metadata. \
    \ A predefined set of metadata tags must be\n          created to make use of\
    \ metadata tags consistent for the life\n          of the Series.\n      8.  Graphics\
    \ may include ASCII art and a more complex form to be\n          defined, such\
    \ as SVG line art [SVG].  Color and grayscale will\n          not be accepted.\
    \  RFCs must correctly display in monochromatic\n          black-and-white to\
    \ allow for monochrome displays, black-and-\n          white printing, and support\
    \ for visual disabilities.\n      9.  The Canonical format must be renderable\
    \ into self-contained\n          Publication formats in order to be easily downloaded\
    \ and read\n          offline.\n      10. Fixed-width fonts and non-reflowable\
    \ text are required for\n          ASCII-art sections, source code examples, and\
    \ other places\n          where strict alignment is required.\n      11. At least\
    \ one Publication format must support readable print to\n          standard paper\
    \ sizes.\n      12. The Canonical format should be structured to enable easy\n\
    \          program identification and parsing of code or specifications,\n   \
    \       such as MIB modules and ABNF.\n   The requirements of the RFC Editor regarding\
    \ RFC format and the\n   publication process include:\n      13. The final conversion\
    \ of all submitted documents to nroff\n          should be replaced by using an\
    \ accepted Revisable format\n          throughout the process.\n      14. In order\
    \ to maintain an efficient publication process, the RFC\n          Editor must\
    \ work with the minimal number of files required for\n          each submission\
    \ (not a tar ball of several discrete\n          components).\n      15. In order\
    \ to maintain the focus of the RFC Editor on editing\n          for clarity and\
    \ consistency rather than document layout\n          details, the number of Publication\
    \ formats produced by the RFC\n          editor must be limited.\n      16. Tools\
    \ must support error checking against document layout\n          issues as well\
    \ as other format details (diagrams, line breaks,\n          variable- and fixed-width\
    \ fonts).\n"
