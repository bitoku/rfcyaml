  - "1.  Introduction\n   The PCE-based network architecture [RFC4655] defines a Path\n\
    \   Computation Element (PCE) as an entity capable of computing TE-LSP\n   paths\
    \ based on a network graph, and applying computational\n   constraints.  A PCE\
    \ serves path computation requests sent by Path\n   Computation Clients (PCC).\n\
    \   A PCC is a client application requesting a path computation to be\n   performed\
    \ by a PCE.  This can be, for instance, an LSR requesting a\n   path for a TE-LSP\
    \ for which it is the head-end, or a PCE requesting a\n   path computation of\
    \ another PCE (inter-PCE communication).  The\n   communication between a PCC\
    \ and a PCE requires a client-server\n   protocol whose generic requirements are\
    \ listed in [RFC4657].\n   The PCE based architecture requires that a PCC be aware\
    \ of the\n   location of one or more PCEs in its domain, and also potentially\
    \ of\n   some PCEs in other domains, e.g., in case of inter-domain path\n   computation.\n\
    \   In that context, it would be highly desirable to define a mechanism\n   for\
    \ automatic and dynamic PCE discovery, which would allow PCCs to\n   automatically\
    \ discover a set of PCEs, to determine additional\n   information required for\
    \ PCE selection, and to dynamically detect new\n   PCEs or any modification of\
    \ the PCEs' information.  This includes the\n   discovery by a PCC of a set of\
    \ one or more PCEs in its domain, and\n   potentially in some other domains. \
    \ The latter is a desirable\n   function in the case of inter-domain path computation,\
    \ for example.\n   This document lists a set of functional requirements for such\
    \ an\n   automatic and dynamic PCE discovery mechanism.  Section 2 points out\n\
    \   the problem statement.  Section 3 illustrates an application\n   scenario.\
    \  Finally, Section 4 addresses detailed requirements.\n   It is intended that\
    \ solutions that specify procedures and protocols\n   or protocol extensions for\
    \ PCE discovery satisfy these requirements.\n   There is no intent either to specify\
    \ solution-specific requirements\n   or to make any assumption on the protocols\
    \ that could be used for the\n   discovery.\n   Note that requirements listed\
    \ in this document apply equally to PCEs\n   that are capable of computing paths\
    \ in MPLS-TE-enabled networks and\n   PCEs that are capable of computing paths\
    \ in GMPLS-enabled networks\n   (and PCEs capable of both).\n   It is also important\
    \ to note that the notion of a PCC encompasses a\n   PCE acting as PCC when requesting\
    \ a path computation of another PCE\n   (inter-PCE communication).  Hence, this\
    \ document does not make the\n   distinction between PCE discovery by PCCs and\
    \ PCE discovery by PCEs.\n"

    '
- title: 2.1.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Problem Statement\n   A routing domain may, in practice, contain multiple\
    \ PCEs:\n   - The path computation load may be balanced among a set of PCEs to\n\
    \     improve scalability.\n   - For the purpose of redundancy, primary and backup\
    \ PCEs may be used.\n   - PCEs may have distinct path computation capabilities\
    \ (multi-\n     constrained path computation, backup path computation, etc.).\n\
    \   - In an inter-domain context, there can be several PCEs with distinct\n  \
    \   inter-domain functions (inter-area, inter-AS, inter-layer), each\n     PCE\
    \ being responsible for path computation in one or more domains.\n   In order\
    \ to allow for effective PCE selection by PCCs, that is, to\n   select the appropriate\
    \ PCE based on its capabilities and perform\n   efficient load balancing of requests,\
    \ a PCC needs to know the\n   location of PCEs in its domain, along with some\
    \ information relevant\n   to PCE selection, and also potentially needs to know\
    \ the location of\n   some PCEs in other domains, for inter-domain path computation\n\
    \   purpose.\n   Such PCE information could be learned through manual configuration,\n\
    \   on each PCC, of the set of PCEs along with their capabilities.  Such\n   a\
    \ manual configuration approach may be sufficient, and even desired\n   in some\
    \ particular situations (e.g., inter-AS PCE discovery, where\n   manual configuration\
    \ of neighbor PCEs may be preferred for security\n   reasons), but it obviously\
    \ faces several limitations:\n   - This may imply a substantial configuration\
    \ overhead.\n   - This would not allow a PCC to dynamically detect that a new\
    \ PCE is\n     available, that an existing PCE is no longer available, or that\n\
    \     there is a change in the PCE's information.\n   Furthermore, as with any\
    \ manual configuration approach, there is a\n   risk of configuration errors.\n\
    \   As an example, in a multi-area network made up of one backbone area\n   and\
    \ N peripheral areas, and where inter-area MPLS-TE path computation\n   relies\
    \ on multiple-PCE path computation with ABRs acting as PCEs, the\n   backbone\
    \ area would comprise at least N PCEs, and the configuration\n   of PCC would\
    \ be too cumbersome (e.g., in existing multi-area\n   networks, N can be beyond\
    \ fifty).\n   Hence, an automated PCE discovery mechanism allowing a PCC to\n\
    \   dynamically discover a set of PCEs is highly desirable.\n"

    \ In\n   particular, key consideration MUST be given in terms of how to\n   establish\
    \ a trust model for PCE discovery.\n   OPTIONALLY, a PCE discovery mechanism MAY\
    \ be used so as to disclose a\n   set of detailed PCE capabilities so that the\

- title: 4.1.1.2.  Discovery of PCE Domains and Inter-domain Functions
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.2.  Discovery of PCE Domains and Inter-domain Functions\n   Inter-domain\
    \ path computation is a key application of the PCE-based\n   architecture.  This\
    \ can rely on a multiple-PCE path computation,\n   where PCEs in each domain compute\
    \ a part of the end-to-end path and\n   collaborate with each other to find the\
    \ end-to-end-path.  Inter-\n   domain path computation can also rely on a single-PCE\
    \ path\n   computation where a PCE has visibility inside multiple domains and\n\
    \   can compute an entire end-to-end inter-domain path (that is, a path\n   from\
    \ the inter-domain TE-LSP head-end to the inter-domain TE-LSP tail\n   end).\n\
    \   Hence, the PCE discovery mechanism MUST allow the discovery of the\n   set\
    \ of one or more domains where a PCE has visibility and can compute\n   paths.\
    \  These domains could be identified using a domain identifier:\n   For instance,\
    \ an IGP area can be identified by the Area ID (OSPF or\n   ISIS), and an AS can\
    \ be identified by the AS number.\n   Also the PCE discovery mechanism MUST allow\
    \ discovery of the inter-\n   domain functions of a PCE, i.e., whether a PCE can\
    \ be used to compute\n   or to take part in the computation of end-to-end paths\
    \ across domain\n   borders.  The inter-domain functions include nonexhaustively:\
    \ inter-\n   area, inter-AS and inter-layer path computation.  Note that these\n\
    \   functions are not mutually exclusive.\n   Note that the inter-domain functions\
    \ are not necessarily inferred\n   from the set of domains where a PCE has visibility.\
    \  For instance, a\n   PCE may have visibility limited to a single domain, but\
    \ may be able\n   to take part in the computation of inter-domain paths by\n \
    \  collaborating with PCEs in other domains.  Conversely, a PCE may have\n   visibility\
    \ in multiple domains, but the operator may not want the PCE\n   to be used for\
    \ inter-domain path computations.\n   The PCE discovery mechanisms MUST also allow\
    \ discovery of the set of\n   one or more domains toward which a PCE can compute\
    \ paths.  For\n   instance, in an inter-AS path computation context, there may\
    \ be\n   several PCEs in an AS, each one responsible for taking part in the\n\
    \   computation of inter-AS paths toward a set of one or more destination\n  \
    \ ASs, and a PCC may have to discover the destination ASs each PCE is\n   responsible\
    \ for.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  Inter-AS Specific Requirements\n   When using a PCE-based approach for\
    \ inter-AS path computation, a PCC\n   in one AS may need to learn information\
    \ related to inter-AS capable\n   PCEs located in other ASs.  For that purpose,\
    \ and as pointed out in\n   the previous section, the PCE discovery mechanism\
    \ MUST allow\n   disclosure of information related to inter-AS-capable PCEs across\
    \ AS\n   boundaries.\n   Such inter-AS PCE discovery must be carefully controlled.\
    \  For\n   security and confidentiality reasons, particularly in an inter-\n \
    \  provider context, the discovery mechanism MUST allow the discovery\n   scope\
    \ to be limited to a set of ASs and MUST also provide control of\n   the PCE information\
    \ to be disclosed across ASs.  This is achieved by\n   applying policies (see\
    \ also Section 4.4).  This implies the\n   capability to contain a PCE advertisement\
    \ to a restricted set of one\n   or more ASs, and to filter and translate any\
    \ PCE parameter (PCE\n   domains, PCE inter-domain functions, PCE capabilities,\
    \ etc.) in\n   disclosures that cross AS borders.  For the sake of illustration,\
    \ it\n   may be useful to disclose detailed PCE information (such as detailed\n\
    \   capabilities) locally in the PCE's AS but only general information\n   (such\
    \ as location and supported domains) in other ASs.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.3.  PCE Information Synchronization\n   The PCE discovery mechanism MUST allow\
    \ a PCC to discover any change\n   in the information related to a PCE that it\
    \ has previously\n   discovered.  This includes changes to both general information\
    \ (e.g.,\n   a change in the PCE domains supported) and detailed information if\n\
    \   supported (e.g., a modification of the PCE's capabilities).\n   In addition,\
    \ the PCE discovery mechanism MUST allow dynamic discovery\n   of new PCEs in\
    \ a given discovery scope.\n   Note that there is no requirement for real-time\
    \ detection of these\n   changes; the PCE discovery mechanism SHOULD rather allow\
    \ discovery of\n   these changes in a range of 60 seconds, and the operator should\
    \ have\n   the ability to configure the discovery delay.\n   Note that PCE information\
    \ is relatively static and is expected to be\n   fairly stable and not to change\

    \   service disruption.\n   Note that there is no requirement for real-time detection\
    \ of PCE\n   failure/deactivation; the PCE discovery mechanism SHOULD rather allow\n\
    \   such discovery in a range of 60 seconds, and the operator should have\n  \

    \   also to filter and translate some information at domains borders.  It\n  \
    \ MUST be possible to apply these policies on a per-PCE basis.\n   Note that the\
    \ discovery mechanisms MUST allow disclosing policy\n   information so as to control\
    \ the disclosure policies at domain\n   boundaries.\n   Also, it MUST be possible\
    \ to apply different policies when disclosing\n   PCE information to different\
    \ domains.\n"
- title: 4.6.  Security Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Security Requirements\n   The five major threats related to PCE discovery\
    \ mechanisms are\n   - impersonation of PCE;\n   - interception of PCE discovery\
    \ information (sniffing);\n   - falsification of PCE discovery information;\n\
    \   - information disclosure to non-authorized PCCs (PCC spoofing);\n   - Denial\
    \ of Service (DoS) Attacks.\n   Note that security of the PCE discovery procedures\
    \ is of particular\n   importance in an inter-AS context, where PCE discovery\
    \ may increase\n   the vulnerability to attacks and the consequences of these\
    \ attacks.\n   Hence, mechanisms MUST be defined to ensure authenticity, integrity,\n\
    \   confidentiality, and containment of PCE discovery information:\n   - There\
    \ MUST be a mechanism to authenticate discovery information.\n   - There MUST\
    \ be a mechanism to verify discovery information\n     integrity.\n   - There\
    \ MUST be a mechanism to encrypt discovery information.\n   - There MUST be a\
    \ mechanism to restrict the scope of discovery to a\n     set of authorized PCCs\
    \ and to filter PCE information disclosed at\n     domain boundaries (as per defined\
    \ in Section 4.5).\n   A PCE and PCC MUST be identified by a globally unique ID,\
    \ which may\n   be, for instance, a combination of AS number and IP address.\n\
    \   Mechanisms MUST be defined in order to limit the impact of a DoS\n   attack\
    \ on the PCE discovery procedure (e.g., filter out excessive PCE\n   information\
    \ change and flapping PCEs).  Note also that DoS attacks\n   may be either accidental\
    \ (caused by a misbehaving PCE system) or\n   intentional.  As discussed in [RFC4657],\
    \ such mechanisms may include\n   packet filtering, rate limiting, no promiscuous\
    \ listening, and where\n   applicable use of private addresses spaces.\n   Also,\
    \ key consideration MUST be given in terms of how to establish a\n   trust model\
    \ for PCE discovery.  The PCE discovery mechanism MUST\n   explicitly support\
