- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC4412] defines the \"Resource-Priority Namespaces\" and\
    \ \"Resource-\n   Priority Priority-values\" registries.  The management policy\
    \ of these\n   registries is \"Standards Action\" [RFC5226].  Experience suggests\
    \ that\n   a document that only defines a new namespace with its priorities, and\n\
    \   does not create new protocol semantics, should not be a Standards-\n   Track\
    \ document.  Therefore, this document updates [RFC4412] to change\n   the management\
    \ policy of the registries to \"IETF Review\".\n"
