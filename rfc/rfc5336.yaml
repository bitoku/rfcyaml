  - "1.  Introduction\n   An internationalized email address includes two parts, the\
    \ local part\n   and the domain part.  The ways email addresses are used by protocols\n\
    \   are different from the ways domain names are used.  The most critical\n  \
    \ difference is that emails are delivered through a chain of clients\n   and servers,\
    \ while domain names are resolved by name servers looking\n   up those names in\
    \ their own tables.  In addition to this, the Simple\n   Mail Transfer Protocol\
    \ [RFC2821] provides a negotiation mechanism\n   about service extension with\
    \ which clients can discover server\n   capabilities and make decisions for further\
    \ processing.  An extended\n   overview of the extension model for internationalized\
    \ addresses and\n   headers appears in [RFC4952], referred to as \"the framework\
    \ document\"\n   or just as \"Framework\" elsewhere in this specification.  This\n\
    \   document specifies an SMTP extension to permit internationalized\n   email\
    \ addresses in envelopes, and UNICODE characters (encoded in\n   UTF-8) [RFC3629]\
    \ in headers.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Role of This Specification
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Role of This Specification\n   The framework document specifies the requirements\
    \ for, and describes\n   components of, full internationalization of electronic\
    \ mail.  A\n   thorough understanding of the information in that document and\
    \ in the\n   base Internet email specifications [RFC2821] [RFC2822] is necessary\n\
    \   to understand and implement this specification.\n   This document specifies\
    \ an element of the email internationalization\n   work, specifically the definition\
    \ of an SMTP extension [RFC2821] for\n   internationalized email address transport\
    \ delivery.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"\
    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n   The terms \"conventional message\" and \"internationalized\
    \ message\" are\n   defined in an appendix to this specification.  The terms \"\
    UTF-8\n   string\" or \"UTF-8 character\" are used informally to refer to Unicode\n\
    \   characters encoded in UTF-8 [RFC3629].  All other specialized terms\n   used\
    \ in this specification are defined in the framework document or\n   in the base\
    \ Internet email specifications [RFC2821] [RFC2822].  In\n   particular, the terms\
    \ \"ASCII address\", \"internationalized email\n   address\", \"non-ASCII address\"\
    , \"i18mail address\", \"UTF8SMTP\",\n   \"message\", and \"mailing list\" are\
    \ used in this document according to\n   the definitions in the framework document.\n\
    \   This specification defines only those Augmented BNF (ABNF) [RFC5234]\n   syntax\
    \ rules that are different from those of the base email\n   specifications [RFC2821][RFC2822]\
    \ and, where the earlier rules are\n   upgraded or extended, gives them new names.\
    \  When the new rule is a\n   small modification to the older one, it is typically\
    \ given a name\n   starting with \"u\".  Rules that are undefined here may be\
    \ found in the\n   base email specifications under the same names.\n"
- title: 2.  Overview of Operation
  contents:
  - "2.  Overview of Operation\n   This specification describes an optional extension\
    \ to the email\n   transport mechanism that permits non-ASCII [ASCII] characters\
    \ in both\n   the envelope and header fields of messages, which are encoded with\n\
    \   UTF-8 [RFC3629] characters.  The extension is identified with the\n   token\
    \ \"UTF8SMTP\".  In order to provide information that may be needed\n   in downgrading,\
    \ an optional alternate ASCII address may be needed if\n   an SMTP client attempts\
    \ to transfer an internationalized message and\n   encounters a server that does\
    \ not support this extension.\n   The EAI UTF-8 header specification [RFC5335]\
    \ provides the details of\n   how and where non-ASCII characters are permitted\
    \ in the header fields\n   of messages.  The context for this specification is\
    \ described in the\n   framework document.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Framework for the Internationalization Extension
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Framework for the Internationalization Extension\n   The following service\
    \ extension is defined:\n   1.   The name of the SMTP service extension is \"\
    Email Address\n        Internationalization\".\n   2.   The EHLO keyword value\
    \ associated with this extension is\n        \"UTF8SMTP\".\n   3.   No parameter\
    \ values are defined for this EHLO keyword value.  In\n        order to permit\
    \ future (although unanticipated) extensions, the\n        EHLO response MUST\
    \ NOT contain any parameters for that keyword.\n        Clients MUST ignore any\
    \ parameters; that is, clients MUST behave\n        as if the parameters do not\
    \ appear.  If a server includes\n        UTF8SMTP in its EHLO response, it MUST\
    \ be fully compliant with\n        this version of this specification.\n   4.\
    \   One optional parameter, ALT-ADDRESS, is added to the MAIL and\n        RCPT\
    \ commands of SMTP.  ALT-ADDRESS specifies an all-ASCII\n        address which\
    \ can be used as a substitute for the corresponding\n        primary (i18mail)\
    \ address when downgrading.  More discussion of\n        the use of this parameter\
    \ appears in [RFC4952] and [Downgrade].\n   5.   One optional parameter \"UTF8REPLY\"\
    \ is added to the VRFY and EXPN\n        commands.  The parameter UTF8REPLY has\
    \ no value.  The parameter\n        indicates that the SMTP client can accept\
    \ Unicode characters in\n        UTF-8 encoding in replies from the VRFY and EXPN\
    \ commands.\n   6.   No additional SMTP verbs are defined by this extension.\n\
    \   7.   Servers offering this extension MUST provide support for, and\n     \
    \   announce, the 8BITMIME extension [RFC1652].\n   8.   The reverse-path and\
    \ forward-path of the SMTP MAIL and RCPT\n        commands are extended to allow\
    \ Unicode characters encoded in\n        UTF-8 in mailbox names (addresses).\n\
    \   9.   The mail message body is extended as specified in [RFC5335].\n   10.\
    \  The maximum length of MAIL and RCPT command lines is increased\n        by\
    \ 460 characters by the possible addition of the ALT-ADDRESS\n        keyword\
    \ and value.\n   11.  The UTF8SMTP extension is valid on the submission port\n\
    \        [RFC4409].\n"
- title: 3.2.  The UTF8SMTP Extension
  contents:
  - "3.2.  The UTF8SMTP Extension\n   An SMTP server that announces this extension\
    \ MUST be prepared to\n   accept a UTF-8 string [RFC3629] in any position in which\
    \ RFC 2821\n   specifies that a mailbox can appear.  That string MUST be parsed\
    \ only\n   as specified in RFC 2821, i.e., by separating the mailbox into source\n\
    \   route, local part, and domain part, using only the characters colon\n   (U+003A),\
    \ comma (U+002C), and at-sign (U+0040) as specified there.\n   Once isolated by\
    \ this parsing process, the local part MUST be treated\n   as opaque unless the\
    \ SMTP server is the final delivery Mail Transfer\n   Agent (MTA).  Any domain\
    \ names that are to be looked up in the DNS\n   MUST first be processed into the\
    \ form specified in\n   \"Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)\"\
    \ [RFC3490] by\n   means of the ToASCII() operation unless they are already in\
    \ that\n   form.  Any domain names that are to be compared to local strings\n\
    \   SHOULD be checked for validity and then MUST be compared as specified\n  \
    \ in Section 3.4 of IDNA.\n   An SMTP client that receives the UTF8SMTP extension\
    \ keyword in\n   response to the EHLO command MAY transmit mailbox names within\
    \ SMTP\n   commands as internationalized strings in UTF-8 form.  It MAY send a\n\
    \   UTF-8 header [RFC5335] (which may also include mailbox names in\n   UTF-8).\
    \  It MAY transmit the domain parts of mailbox names within\n   SMTP commands\
    \ or the message header as either ACE (ASCII Compatible\n   Encoding) labels (as\
    \ specified in IDNA [RFC3490]) or UTF-8 strings.\n   All labels in domain parts\
    \ of mailbox names which are IDNs (either\n   UTF-8 or ACE strings) MUST be valid.\
    \  If the original client submits\n   a message to a Message Submission Server\
    \ (\"MSA\") [RFC4409], it is the\n   responsibility of the MSA that all domain\
    \ labels are valid;\n   otherwise, it is the original client's responsibility.\
    \  The presence\n   of the UTF8SMTP extension does not change the requirement\
    \ of RFC 2821\n   that servers relaying mail MUST NOT attempt to parse, evaluate,\
    \ or\n   transform the local part in any way.\n   If the UTF8SMTP SMTP extension\
    \ is not offered by the Server, the SMTP\n   client MUST NOT transmit an internationalized\
    \ address and MUST NOT\n   transmit a mail message containing internationalized\
    \ mail headers as\n   described in [RFC5335] at any level within its MIME structure.\
    \  (For\n   this paragraph, the internationalized domain name in the form of ACE\n\
    \   labels as specified in IDNA [RFC3490] is not considered as\n   \"internationalized\"\
    .)  Instead, if an SMTP client (SMTP sender)\n   attempts to transfer an internationalized\
    \ message and encounters a\n   server that does not support the extension, it\
    \ MUST make one of the\n   following four choices:\n   1.  If and only if the\
    \ SMTP client (sender) is a Message Submission\n       Server (\"MSA\") [RFC4409],\
    \ it MAY, consistent with the general\n       provisions for changes by such servers,\
    \ rewrite the envelope,\n       headers, or message material to make them entirely\
    \ ASCII and\n       consistent with the provisions of RFC 2821 [RFC2821] and RFC\
    \ 2822\n       [RFC2822].\n   2.  It may either reject the message during the\
    \ SMTP transaction or\n       accept the message and then generate and transmit\
    \ a notification\n       of non-deliverability.  Such notification MUST be done\
    \ as\n       specified in RFC 2821 [RFC2821], RFC 3464 [RFC3464], and the EAI\n\
    \       delivery status notification (DSN) specification [RFC5337].\n   3.  It\
    \ may find an alternate route to the destination that permits\n       UTF8SMTP.\
    \  That route may be discovered by trying alternate Mail\n       eXchanger (MX)\
    \ hosts (using preference rules as specified in RFC\n       2821) or using other\
    \ means available to the SMTP-sender.\n   4.  If and only if ASCII addresses are\
    \ available for all addresses\n       that appear in the return path and the specific\
    \ forward paths\n       being attempted, it may downgrade the message to an all-ASCII\n\
    \       form as specified in [Downgrade].  An ASCII address is considered\n  \
    \     to be \"available\" for a particular address if the original\n       address\
    \ in the envelope is in ASCII or if an ALT-ADDRESS\n       parameter is specified\
    \ for a UTF8SMTP address.\n   The difference between choice 1 and choice 4 is\
    \ that choice 1 is\n   constrained by Message Submission [RFC4409], while choice\
    \ 4 is\n   constrained by [Downgrade].\n"
- title: 3.3.  Extended Mailbox Address Syntax
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Extended Mailbox Address Syntax\n   RFC 2821, Section 4.1.2, defines the\
    \ syntax of a mailbox entirely in\n   terms of ASCII characters, using the production\
    \ for a mailbox and\n   those productions on which it depends.\n   The key changes\
    \ made by this specification are, informally, to\n   o  Change the definition\
    \ of \"sub-domain\" to permit either the\n      definition above or a UTF-8 string\
    \ representing a DNS label that\n      is conformant with IDNA [RFC3490].\n  \

- title: 3.4.  The ALT-ADDRESS Parameter
  contents:
  - "3.4.  The ALT-ADDRESS Parameter\n   If the UTF8SMTP extension is offered, the\
    \ syntax of the SMTP MAIL and\n   RCPT commands is extended to support the optional\
    \ esmtp-keyword \"ALT-\n   ADDRESS\".  That keyword specifies an alternate all-ASCII\
    \ address that\n   may be used when downgrading.  If the ALT-ADDRESS esmtp-keyword\
    \ is\n   used, it MUST have an associated esmtp-value (ALT-ADDRESS-esmtp-\n  \
    \ value, which is defined below).\n   While it may be tempting to consider ALT-ADDRESS\
    \ as a general-purpose\n   second-chance address, such behavior is not defined\
    \ here.  Instead,\n   in this specification ALT-ADDRESS only has meaning when\

    \ message\" as defined in the appendix of this\n   specification MUST NOT be sent\
    \ to an SMTP server that does not\n   support UTF8SMTP.  Such a message MAY be\
    \ rejected by a server if it\n   lacks ALT-ADDRESSes as discussed in Section 3.2\
    \ of this\n   specification.\n   The three-digit reply codes used in this section\
    \ are consistent with\n   their meanings as defined in RFC 2821.\n   When messages\
    \ are rejected because the RCPT command requires an ALT-\n   ADDRESS, the response\

  contents:
  - "3.6.  Body Parts and SMTP Extensions\n   There is no ESMTP parameter to assert\
    \ that a message is an\n   internationalized message.  An SMTP server that requires\
    \ accurate\n   knowledge of whether a message is internationalized is required\
    \ to\n   parse all message header fields and MIME header fields in the message\n\
    \   body.\n   While this specification requires that servers support the 8BITMIME\n\
    \   extension [RFC1652] to ensure that servers have adequate handling\n   capability\
    \ for 8-bit data and to avoid a number of complex encoding\n   problems, the use\
    \ of internationalized addresses obviously does not\n   require non-ASCII body\
    \ parts in the MIME message.  The UTF8SMTP\n   extension MAY be used with the\
    \ BODY=8BITMIME parameter if that is\n   appropriate given the body content or,\
    \ with the BODY=BINARYMIME\n   parameter, if the server advertises BINARYMIME\
    \ [RFC3030] and that is\n   appropriate.\n   Assuming that the server advertises\
    \ UTF8SMTP and 8BITMIME, and\n   receives at least one non-ASCII address, with\
    \ or without ALT-ADDRESS,\n   the precise interpretation of 'No BODY parameter',\
    \ \"BODY=8BITMIME\",\n   and \"BODY=BINARYMIME\" in the MAIL command is:\n   1.\
    \  If there is no BODY parameter, the header contains UTF-8\n       characters,\
    \ but all the body parts are in ASCII (possibly as the\n       result of a content-transfer-encoding).\n\
    \   2.  If a BODY=8BITMIME parameter is present, the header contains\n       UTF-8\
    \ characters, and some or all of the body parts contain 8-bit\n       line-oriented\
    \ data.\n   3.  If a BODY=BINARYMIME parameter is present, the header contains\n\
    \       UTF-8 characters, and some or all body parts contain binary data\n   \
    \    without restriction as to line lengths or delimiters.\n"
- title: 3.7.  Additional ESMTP Changes and Clarifications
  contents:
  - "3.7.  Additional ESMTP Changes and Clarifications\n   The information carried\
    \ in the mail transport process involves\n   addresses (\"mailboxes\") and domain\
    \ names in various contexts in\n   addition to the MAIL and RCPT commands and\
    \ extended alternatives to\n   them.  In general, the rule is that, when RFC 2821\
    \ specifies a\n   mailbox, this specification expects UTF-8 to be used for the\
    \ entire\n   string; when RFC 2821 specifies a domain name, the name SHOULD be\
    \ in\n   the form of ACE labels if its raw form is non-ASCII.\n   The following\
    \ subsections list and discuss all of the relevant cases.\n"
- title: 3.7.1.  The Initial SMTP Exchange
  contents:
  - "3.7.1.  The Initial SMTP Exchange\n   When an SMTP connection is opened, the\
    \ server normally sends a\n   \"greeting\" response consisting of the 220 response\
    \ code and some\n   information.  The client then sends the EHLO command.  Since\
    \ the\n   client cannot know whether the server supports UTF8SMTP until after\n\
    \   it receives the response from EHLO, any domain names that appear in\n   this\
    \ dialogue, or in responses to EHLO, MUST be in the hostname form,\n   i.e., internationalized\
    \ ones MUST be in the form of ACE labels.\n"
- title: 3.7.2.  Mail eXchangers
  contents:
  - "3.7.2.  Mail eXchangers\n   Organizations often authorize multiple servers to\
    \ accept mail\n   addressed to them.  For example, the organization may itself\
    \ operate\n   more than one server, and may also or instead have an agreement\
    \ with\n   other organizations to accept mail as a backup.  Authorized servers\n\
    \   are generally listed in MX records as described in RFC 2821.  When\n   more\
    \ than one server accepts mail for the domain-part of a mailbox,\n   it is strongly\
    \ advised that either all or none of them support the\n   UTF8SMTP extension.\
    \  Otherwise, surprising downgrades can happen\n   during temporary failures,\
    \ which users might perceive as a serious\n   reliability issue.\n"
- title: 3.7.3.  Trace Information
  contents:
  - "3.7.3.  Trace Information\n   When an SMTP server receives a message for delivery\
    \ or further\n   processing, it MUST insert trace (\"time stamp\" or \"Received\"\
    )\n   information at the beginning of the message content.  \"Time stamp\" or\n\
    \   \"Received\" appears in the form of \"Received:\" lines.  The most\n   important\
    \ use of Received: lines is for debugging mail faults.  When\n   the delivery\
    \ SMTP server makes the \"final delivery\" of a message, it\n   inserts a Return-path\
    \ line at the beginning of the mail data.  The\n   primary purpose of the Return-path\
    \ is to designate the address to\n   which messages indicating non-delivery or\
    \ other mail system failures\n   are to be sent.  For the trace information, this\
    \ memo updates the\n   time stamp line and the return path line [RFC2821] formally\
    \ defined\n   as follows:\n      uReturn-path-line = \"Return-Path:\" FWS uReverse-path\

- title: 3.7.4.2.  VRFY and EXPN Commands and the UTF8REPLY Parameter
  contents:
  - "3.7.4.2.  VRFY and EXPN Commands and the UTF8REPLY Parameter\n   If the VRFY\
    \ and EXPN commands are transmitted with an optional\n   parameter \"UTF8REPLY\"\
    , it indicates the client can accept UTF-8\n   strings in replies from those commands.\
    \  This allows the server to\n   use UTF-8 strings in mailbox names and full names\
    \ that occur in\n   replies without concern that the client might be confused\
    \ by them.\n   An SMTP client that conforms to this specification MUST accept\
    \ and\n   correctly process replies from the VRFY and EXPN commands that\n   contain\
    \ UTF-8 strings.  However, the SMTP server MUST NOT use UTF-8\n   strings in replies\
    \ if the SMTP client does not specifically allow\n   such replies by transmitting\
    \ this parameter.  Most replies do not\n   require that a mailbox name be included\
    \ in the returned text, and\n   therefore UTF-8 is not needed in them.  Some replies,\
    \ notably those\n   resulting from successful execution of the VRFY and EXPN commands,\
    \ do\n   include the mailbox, making the provisions of this section important.\n\
    \   VERIFY (VRFY) and EXPAND (EXPN) command syntaxes are changed to:\n       \"\
    VRFY\" SP (uLocal-part / uMailbox) [SP \"UTF8REPLY\"] CRLF\n              ; uLocal-part\
    \ and uMailbox are defined in\n              ; Section 3.3 of this document.\n\
    \       \"EXPN\" SP ( uLocal-part / uMailbox ) [ SP \"UTF8REPLY\" ] CRLF\n   \
    \           ; uLocal-part and uMailbox are defined in\n              ; Section\
    \ 3.3 of this document.\n   The \"UTF8REPLY\" parameter does not use a value.\
    \  If the reply to a\n   VERIFY (VRFY) or EXPAND (EXPN) command requires UTF-8,\
    \ but the SMTP\n   client does not use the \"UTF8REPLY\" parameter, then the server\
    \ MUST\n   use either the response code 252 or 550.  Response code 252, defined\n\
    \   in [RFC2821], means \"Cannot VRFY user, but will accept the message\n   and\
    \ attempt the delivery\".  Response code 550, also defined in\n   [RFC2821], means\
    \ \"Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable\".\n   When the server supports\
    \ enhanced mail system status codes [RFC3463],\n   the enhanced response code\
    \ as specified below is used.  Using the\n   \"UTF8REPLY\" parameter with a VERIFY\
    \ (VRFY) or EXPAND (EXPN) command\n   enables UTF-8 replies for that command only.\n\
    \   If a normal success response (i.e., 250) is returned, the response\n   MAY\
    \ include the full name of the user and MUST include the mailbox of\n   the user.\
    \  It MUST be in either of the following forms:\n         User Name <uMailbox>\n\
    \            ; uMailbox is defined in Section 3.3 of this document.\n        \
    \    ; User Name can contain non-ASCII characters.\n         uMailbox\n      \
    \      ; uMailbox is defined in Section 3.3 of this document.\n   If the SMTP\
    \ reply requires UTF-8 strings, but UTF-8 is not allowed in\n   the reply, and\
    \ the server supports enhanced mail system status codes\n   [RFC3463], the enhanced\
    \ response code is either \"X.6.8\" or \"X.6.10\"\n   [RFC5248], meaning \"A reply\
    \ containing a UTF-8 string is required to\n   show the mailbox name, but that\
    \ form of response is not permitted by\n   the client\".\n   If the SMTP client\
    \ does not support the UTF8SMTP extension, but\n   receives a UTF-8 string in\
    \ a reply, it may not be able to properly\n   report the reply to the user, and\
    \ some clients might crash.\n   Internationalized messages in replies are only\
    \ allowed in the\n   commands under the situations described above.  Under any\
    \ other\n   circumstances, UTF-8 text MUST NOT appear in the reply.\n   Although\
    \ UTF-8 is needed to represent email addresses in responses\n   under the rules\
    \ specified in this section, this extension does not\n   permit the use of UTF-8\
    \ for any other purposes.  SMTP servers MUST\n   NOT include non-ASCII characters\
    \ in replies except in the limited\n   cases specifically permitted in this section.\n"

    \ utilizing one or more of\n      the extensions defined in this specification\

  contents:
  - "A.3.  SMTP Service Extension for DSNs\n   The existing Draft Standard regarding\
    \ delivery status notifications\n   (DSNs) [RFC3461] is limited to ASCII text\
    \ in the machine readable\n   portions of the protocol.  \"International Delivery\
    \ Status and\n   Disposition Notifications\" [RFC5337] adds a new address type\
    \ for\n   international email addresses so an original recipient address with\n\
    \   non-ASCII characters can be correctly preserved even after\n   downgrading.\
    \  If an SMTP server advertises both the UTF8SMTP and the\n   DSN extension, that\
    \ server MUST implement EAI DSN [RFC5337] including\n   support for the ORCPT\
    \ parameter.\n"
- title: A.4.  Implementation Advice
  contents:
  - "A.4.  Implementation Advice\n   In the absence of this extension, SMTP clients\
    \ and servers are\n   constrained to using only those addresses permitted by RFC\
    \ 2821.  The\n   local parts of those addresses MAY be made up of any ASCII\n\
    \   characters, although some of them MUST be quoted as specified there.\n   It\
    \ is notable in an internationalization context that there is a long\n   history\
    \ on some systems of using overstruck ASCII characters (a\n   character, a backspace,\
    \ and another character) within a quoted string\n   to approximate non-ASCII characters.\
    \  This form of\n   internationalization SHOULD be phased out as this extension\
    \ becomes\n   widely deployed, but backward-compatibility considerations require\n\
    \   that it continue to be supported.\n"
- title: A.5.  Applicability of SMTP Extension to Additional Uses
  contents:
  - "A.5.  Applicability of SMTP Extension to Additional Uses\n   Among other protocol\
    \ changes, the SMTP extension allows an optional\n   alternate address to be supplied\
    \ with the MAIL and RCPT commands.\n   For the purposes of this set of specifications,\
    \ this alternate\n   address only has meaning when the primary address contains\
    \ UTF-8\n   characters and the message is downgraded.  While it may be tempting\n\
    \   to consider the alternate address as a general-purpose second-chance\n   address\
    \ to be used whenever the primary address is rejected, such\n   behavior is not\
    \ defined here.  This restriction allows for future\n   extensions to be developed\
    \ which create such a general-purpose\n   second-chance address, although no specific\
    \ work on such an extension\n   is currently anticipated.  Note that any such\
    \ extension needs to\n   consider the question of what the [RFC0974] sequencing\
    \ rules mean\n   when different possible servers support different sets of ESMTP\n\
    \   options (or, in this case, addresses).  The answer to this question\n   may\
    \ also imply updates to [RFC2821].\n"
