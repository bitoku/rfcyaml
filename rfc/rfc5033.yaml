  - "Abstract\n   The IETF's standard congestion control schemes have been widely\
    \ shown\n   to be inadequate for various environments (e.g., high-speed\n   networks).\
    \  Recent research has yielded many alternate congestion\n   control schemes that\
    \ significantly differ from the IETF's congestion\n   control principles.  Using\
    \ these new congestion control schemes in\n   the global Internet has possible\
    \ ramifications to both the traffic\n   using the new congestion control and to\
    \ traffic using the currently\n   standardized congestion control.  Therefore,\
    \ the IETF must proceed\n   with caution when dealing with alternate congestion\
    \ control\n   proposals.  The goal of this document is to provide guidance for\n\
    \   considering alternate congestion control algorithms within the IETF.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document provides guidelines for the IETF to use when\
    \ evaluating\n   suggested congestion control algorithms that significantly differ\n\
    \   from the general congestion control principles outlined in [RFC2914].\n  \
    \ The guidance is intended to be useful to authors proposing alternate\n   congestion\
    \ control and for the IETF community when evaluating whether\n   a proposal is\
    \ appropriate for publication in the RFC series.\n   The guidelines in this document\
    \ are intended to be consistent with\n   the congestion control principles from\
    \ [RFC2914] of preventing\n   congestion collapse, considering fairness, and optimizing\
    \ the flow's\n   own performance in terms of throughput, delay, and loss.  [RFC2914]\n\
    \   also discusses the goal of avoiding a congestion control \"arms race\"\n \
    \  among competing transport protocols.\n   This document does not give hard-and-fast\
    \ requirements for an\n   appropriate congestion control scheme.  Rather, the\
    \ document provides\n   a set of criteria that should be considered and weighed\
    \ by the IETF\n   in the context of each proposal.  The high-order criteria for\
    \ any new\n   proposal is that a serious scientific study of the pros and cons\
    \ of\n   the proposal needs to have been done such that the IETF has a well-\n\
    \   rounded set of information to consider.\n   After initial studies, we encourage\
    \ authors to write a specification\n   of their proposals for publication in the\
    \ RFC series to allow others\n   to concretely understand and investigate the\
    \ wealth of proposals in\n   this space.\n"
- title: 2.  Document Status
  contents:
  - "2.  Document Status\n   Following the lead of HighSpeed TCP [RFC3649], alternate\
    \ congestion\n   control algorithms are expected to be published as \"Experimental\"\
    \n   RFCs until such time that the community better understands the\n   solution\
    \ space.  Traditionally, the meaning of \"Experimental\" status\n   has varied\
    \ in its use and interpretation.  As part of this document\n   we define two classes\
    \ of congestion control proposals that can be\n   published with the \"Experimental\"\
    \ status.  The first class includes\n   algorithms that are judged to be safe\
    \ to deploy for best-effort\n   traffic in the global Internet and further investigated\
    \ in that\n   environment.  The second class includes algorithms that, while\n\
    \   promising, are not deemed safe enough for widespread deployment as\n   best-effort\
    \ traffic on the Internet, but are being specified to\n   facilitate investigations\
    \ in simulation, testbeds, or controlled\n   environments.  The second class can\
    \ also include algorithms where the\n   IETF does not yet have sufficient understanding\
    \ to decide if the\n   algorithm is or is not safe for deployment on the Internet.\n\
    \   Each alternate congestion control algorithm published is required to\n   include\
    \ a statement in the abstract indicating whether or not the\n   proposal is considered\
    \ safe for use on the Internet.  Each alternate\n   congestion control algorithm\
    \ published is also required to include a\n   statement in the abstract describing\
    \ environments where the protocol\n   is not recommended for deployment.  There\
    \ may be environments where\n   the protocol is deemed *safe* for use, but still\
    \ is not *recommended*\n   for use because it does not perform well for the user.\n\
    \   As examples of such statements, [RFC3649] specifying HighSpeed TCP\n   includes\
    \ a statement in the abstract stating that the proposal is\n   Experimental, but\
    \ may be deployed in the current Internet.  In\n   contrast, the Quick-Start document\
    \ [RFC4782] includes a paragraph in\n   the abstract stating the mechanism is\
    \ only being proposed for\n   controlled environments.  The abstract specifies\
    \ environments where\n   the Quick-Start request could give false positives (and\
    \ therefore\n   would be unsafe to deploy).  The abstract also specifies environments\n\
    \   where packets containing the Quick-Start request could be dropped in\n   the\
    \ network; in such an environment, Quick-Start would not be unsafe\n   to deploy,\
    \ but deployment would still not be recommended because it\n   could cause unnecessary\
    \ delays for the connections attempting to use\n   Quick-Start.\n   For authors\
    \ of alternate congestion control schemes who are not ready\n   to bring their\
    \ congestion control mechanisms to the IETF for\n   standardization (either as\
    \ Experimental or as Proposed Standard), one\n   possibility would be to submit\
    \ an internet-draft that documents the\n   alternate congestion control mechanism\
    \ for the benefit of the IETF\n   and IRTF communities.  This is particularly\
    \ encouraged in order to\n   get algorithm specifications widely disseminated\
    \ to facilitate\n   further research.  Such an internet-draft could be submitted\
    \ to be\n   considered as an Informational RFC, as a first step in the process\n\
    \   towards standardization.  Such a document would also be expected to\n   carry\
    \ an explicit warning against using the scheme in the global\n   Internet.\n \
    \  Note: we are not changing the RFC publication process for non-IETF\n   produced\
    \ documents (e.g., those from the IRTF or Independent\n   Submissions via the\
    \ RFC-Editor).  However, we would hope the\n   guidelines in this document inform\
    \ the IESG as they consider whether\n   to add a note to such documents.\n"
- title: 3.  Guidelines
  contents:
  - "3.  Guidelines\n   As noted above, authors are expected to do a well-rounded\
    \ evaluation\n   of the pros and cons of proposals brought to the IETF.  The following\n\
    \   are guidelines to help authors and the IETF community.  Concerns that\n  \
    \ fall outside the scope of these guidelines are certainly possible;\n   these\
    \ guidelines should not be considered as an all-encompassing\n   check-list.\n\
    \   (0) Differences with Congestion Control Principles [RFC2914]\n       Proposed\
    \ congestion control mechanisms should include a clear\n       explanation of\
    \ the deviations from [RFC2914].\n   (1) Impact on Standard TCP, SCTP [RFC2960],\
    \ and DCCP [RFC4340].\n       Proposed congestion control mechanisms should be\
    \ evaluated when\n       competing with standard IETF congestion control [RFC2581,\n\
    \       RFC2960, RFC4340].  Alternate congestion controllers that have a\n   \
    \    significantly negative impact on traffic using standard\n       congestion\
    \ control may be suspect and this aspect should be part\n       of the community's\
    \ decision making with regards to the\n       suitability of the alternate congestion\
    \ control mechanism.\n       We note that this bullet is not a requirement for\
    \ strict TCP-\n       friendliness as a prerequisite for an alternate congestion\n\
    \       control mechanism to advance to Experimental.  As an example,\n      \
    \ HighSpeed TCP is a congestion control mechanism that is\n       Experimental,\
    \ but that is not TCP-friendly in all environments.\n       We also note that\
    \ this guideline does not constrain the fairness\n       offered for non-best-effort\
    \ traffic.\n       As an example from an Experimental RFC, fairness with standard\n\
    \       TCP is discussed in Sections 4 and 6 of [RFC3649] (HighSpeed TCP)\n  \
    \     and using spare capacity is discussed in Sections 6, 11.1, and 12\n    \
    \   of [RFC3649].\n   (2) Difficult Environments.\n       The proposed algorithms\
    \ should be assessed in difficult\n       environments such as paths containing\
    \ wireless links.\n       Characteristics of wireless environments are discussed\
    \ in\n       [RFC3819] and in Section 16 of [Tools].  Other difficult\n      \
    \ environments can include those with multipath routing within a\n       connection.\
    \  We note that there is still much to be desired in\n       terms of the performance\
    \ of TCP in some of these difficult\n       environments.  For congestion control\
    \ mechanisms with explicit\n       feedback from routers, difficult environments\
    \ can include paths\n       with non-IP queues at layer-two, IP tunnels, and the\
    \ like.  A\n       minimum goal for experimental mechanisms proposed for widespread\n\
    \       deployment in the Internet should be that they do not perform\n      \
    \ significantly worse than TCP in these environments.\n       While it is impossible\
    \ to enumerate all the possible \"difficult\n       environments\", we note that\
    \ the IETF has previously grappled with\n       paths with long delays [RFC2488],\
    \ high delay bandwidth products\n       [RFC3649], high packet corruption rates\
    \ [RFC3155], packet\n       reordering [RFC4653], and significantly slow links\
    \ [RFC3150].\n       Aspects of alternate congestion control that impact networks\
    \ with\n       these characteristics should be detailed.\n       As an example\
    \ from an Experimental RFC, performance in difficult\n       environments is discussed\
    \ in Sections 6, 9.2, and 10.2 of\n       [RFC4782] (Quick-Start).\n   (3) Investigating\
    \ a Range of Environments.\n       Similar to the last criteria, proposed alternate\
    \ congestion\n       controllers should be assessed in a range of environments.\
    \  For\n       instance, proposals should be investigated across a range of\n\
    \       bandwidths, round-trip times, levels of traffic on the reverse\n     \
    \  path, and levels of statistical multiplexing at the congested\n       link.\
    \  Similarly, proposals should be investigated for robust\n       performance\
    \ with different queueing mechanisms in the routers,\n       especially Random\
    \ Early Detection (RED) [FJ03] and Drop-Tail.\n       This evaluation is often\
    \ not included in the internet-draft\n       itself, but in related papers cited\
    \ in the draft.\n       A particularly important aspect of evaluating a proposal\
    \ for\n       standardization is in understanding where the algorithm breaks\n\
    \       down.  Therefore, particular attention should be paid to\n       characterizing\
    \ the areas where the proposed mechanism does not\n       perform well.\n    \
    \   As an example from an Experimental RFC, performance in a range of\n      \
    \ environments is discussed in Section 12 of [RFC3649] (HighSpeed\n       TCP)\
    \ and Section 9.7 of [RFC4782] (Quick-Start).\n   (4) Protection Against Congestion\
    \ Collapse.\n       The alternate congestion control mechanism should either stop\n\
    \       sending when the packet drop rate exceeds some threshold\n       [RFC3714],\
    \ or should include some notion of \"full backoff\".  For\n       \"full backoff\"\
    , at some point the algorithm would reduce the\n       sending rate to one packet\
    \ per round-trip time and then\n       exponentially backoff the time between\
    \ single packet\n       transmissions if congestion persists.  Exactly when either\
    \ \"full\n       backoff\" or a pause in sending comes into play will be\n   \
    \    algorithm-specific.  However, as discussed in [RFC2914], this\n       requirement\
    \ is crucial to protect the network in times of extreme\n       congestion.\n\
    \       If \"full backoff\" is used, this bullet does not require that the\n \
    \      full backoff mechanism must be identical to that of TCP\n       [RFC2988].\
    \  As an example, this bullet does not preclude full\n       backoff mechanisms\
    \ that would give flows with different round-\n       trip times comparable bandwidth\
    \ during backoff.\n   (5) Fairness within the Alternate Congestion Control Algorithm.\n\
    \       In environments with multiple competing flows all using the same\n   \
    \    alternate congestion control algorithm, the proposal should\n       explore\
    \ how bandwidth is shared among the competing flows.\n   (6) Performance with\
    \ Misbehaving Nodes and Outside Attackers.\n       The proposal should explore\
    \ how the alternate congestion control\n       mechanism performs with misbehaving\
    \ senders, receivers, or\n       routers.  In addition, the proposal should explore\
    \ how the\n       alternate congestion control mechanism performs with outside\n\
    \       attackers.  This can be particularly important for congestion\n      \
    \ control mechanisms that involve explicit feedback from routers\n       along\
    \ the path.\n       As an example from an Experimental RFC, performance with\n\
    \       misbehaving nodes and outside attackers is discussed in Sections\n   \
    \    9.4, 9.5, and 9.6 of [RFC4782] (Quick-Start).  This includes\n       discussion\
    \ of misbehaving senders and receivers; collusion\n       between misbehaving\
    \ routers; misbehaving middleboxes; and the\n       potential use of Quick-Start\
    \ to attack routers or to tie up\n       available Quick-Start bandwidth.\n  \
    \ (7) Responses to Sudden or Transient Events.\n       The proposal should consider\
    \ how the alternate congestion control\n       mechanism would perform in the\
    \ presence of transient events such\n       as sudden congestion, a routing change,\
    \ or a mobility event.\n       Routing changes, link disconnections, intermittent\
    \ link\n       connectivity, and mobility are discussed in more detail in\n  \
    \     Section 17 of [Tools].\n       As an example from an Experimental RFC, response\
    \ to transient\n       events is discussed in Section 9.2 of [RFC4782] (Quick-Start).\n\
    \   (8) Incremental Deployment.\n       The proposal should discuss whether the\
    \ alternate congestion\n       control mechanism allows for incremental deployment\
    \ in the\n       targeted environment.  For a mechanism targeted for deployment\
    \ in\n       the current Internet, it would be helpful for the proposal to\n \
    \      discuss what is known (if anything) about the correct operation\n     \
    \  of the mechanism with some of the equipment installed in the\n       current\
    \ Internet, e.g., routers, transparent proxies, WAN\n       optimizers, intrusion\
    \ detection systems, home routers, and the\n       like.\n       As a similar\
    \ concern, if the alternate congestion control\n       mechanism is intended only\
    \ for specific environments (and not the\n       global Internet), the proposal\
    \ should consider how this intention\n       is to be carried out.  The community\
    \ will have to address the\n       question of whether the scope can be enforced\
    \ by simply stating\n       the restrictions or whether additional protocol mechanisms\
    \ are\n       required to enforce the scoping.  The answer will necessarily\n\
    \       depend on the change being proposed.\n       As an example from an Experimental\
    \ RFC, deployment issues are\n       discussed in Sections 10.3 and 10.4 of [RFC4782]\
    \ (Quick-Start).\n"
