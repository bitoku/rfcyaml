  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document proposes a revised format for the IANA IPv6\
    \ address\n   registries.  The proposed format would bring the IANA IPv6 address\n\
    \   registries into alignment with the current IPv6 Address Architecture\n   specification,\
    \ as well as update it to a more useful and generally\n   accepted format.\n \
    \  The current (as of preparation of this document) IANA IPv6 registries\n   [iana-ipv6-registry]\
    \ [iana-ipv6-tla] are based on a now-deprecated\n   address architecture that\
    \ used the concept of Top Level Aggregation\n   Identifiers (TLAs) and sub-TLAs.\
    \  The current IPv6 Address\n   Architecture [RFC3513] uses the terminology of\
    \ Global Identifiers\n   instead of TLAs and sub-TLAs.\n"

  - "2.  IPv6 Address Registry\n   The proposed format for the IPv6 address registry\
    \ is indicated by\n   example, using the registry state that is current as of\
    \ preparation\n   of this document, in Figure 1.  The registry explicitly notes\
    \ which\n   entity is placing a reservation on an address block and notes the\n\
    \   defining RFC document for each allocation.\n   The proposed format of the\
    \ registry is a title line, the date of the\n   last change to the registry, the\
    \ registry in a tabular format, notes\n   and references.\n   The table uses 4\
    \ columns.  Within the table, the first column\n   contains an IPv6 address prefix,\
    \ using a hexadecimal notation of the\n   address prefix and a prefix length.\
    \  There are no overlapping address\n   blocks in the first column, and the set\
    \ of address blocks in the\n   registry spans the entire IPv6 address space. \
    \ The second column\n   denotes the current disposition of the address block,\
    \ using notation\n   derived from the defining RFC document.  The third column\
    \ contains a\n   reference to the RFC that describes the current disposition of\
    \ the\n   address block.  The fourth column uses numeric footnote notation to\n\
    \   reference any additional text associated with the address block.\n   The notes\
    \ in the registry may include a summary of previous\n   disposition status values\
    \ associated with an address block, as this\n   summary is specifically not included\
    \ in the registry table.  The\n   notes are numbered sequentially.\n   The reference\
    \ section uses a conventional citation format.  The\n   references include documents\
    \ referenced in the registry table and\n   documents referenced in the notes.\n\

  - "2.1.  Notes on Proposed Format Changes to the Registry\n   o  The textual preamble\
    \ at the start of the registry has been\n      removed, in deference to the use\
    \ of standard IPv6 prefix notation\n      in the registry.\n   o  Binary prefix\
    \ notation has been replaced by standard IPv6 prefix\n      hexadecimal notation,\
    \ and the fraction of address space column has\n      been replaced with the reference\
    \ to the relevant RFC that defines\n      the disposition of the address block.\
    \  Footnote references are\n      also displayed in a consistent fashion.\n  \
    \ o  The terminology \"Unassigned\" has been replaced by the more precise\n  \
    \    phrase \"Reserved by IETF\", indicating the body that has the token\n   \
    \   to permit reassignment of the status of this address block.\n   o  The \"\
    Formerly Site-Local\" entry in the body of the registry has\n      been replaced\
    \ with an explicit reference to deprecation.  A\n      similar treatment is proposed\
    \ for 0200::/8, although the RFC\n      number for the deprecation document has\
    \ yet to be assigned.  There\n      is a distinction drawn between the current\
    \ status of a registry\n      and the set of registry actions that have lead to\
    \ the current\n      state.  The registry table describes the current status of\
    \ the\n      registry, while the text footnotes are used to describe the set of\n\
    \      transactions leading to the current state, including any former\n     \
    \ states.\n   o  Annotations that are references to footnotes are included in\
    \ the\n      registry in a separate column.\n   o  The text commentary on unicast,\
    \ multicast and anycast addresses\n      has been removed, as there is no distinction\
    \ between anycast and\n      unicast addresses and multicast addresses are explicitly\
    \ flagged\n      in the registry.\n   o  A note and a corresponding reference\
    \ to RFC1881 was added to\n      record the formal delegation of the IPv6 address\
    \ management\n      function to IANA.\n"

  - "3.  Global Unicast IPv6 Address Registry\n   The proposed registry format for\
    \ Global Unicast IPv6 address block\n   allocations is indicated by example, using\
    \ the registry state that\n   was current as of preparation of this document,\
    \ in Figure 2.  The\n   registry notes the current allocations, and does not include\
    \ any\n   notation of intended future allocations or reservations.  All address\n\
    \   space not listed in this registry forms the IANA unallocated address\n   pool,\
    \ to be allocated by IANA as per the prevailing address\n   allocation policies.\n\
    \   The proposed format of the registry is a title line, the date of the\n   last\
    \ change to the registry, the registry in a tabular format, notes\n   and references.\n\
    \   The table uses 4 columns.  Within the table, the first column is an\n   IPv6\
    \ address prefix, using a hexadecimal notation of the address\n   prefix and a\
    \ prefix length.  There are no overlapping address blocks\n   in the first column.\
    \  The entries here describe only IANA allocations\n   of address blocks.  Temporary\
    \ IANA reservations for future\n   allocations, allocation expansion windows and\
    \ any other internal IANA\n   states are not described in this registry.  The\
    \ second column\n   describes the current disposition of the address block, by\
    \ noting\n   either the Regional Internet Registry (RIR) to whom the address block\n\
    \   was assigned, or the intended use of the address block.  The third\n   column\
    \ is the date of the IANA allocation, including the day of the\n   month.  The\
    \ fourth column uses numeric footnote notation to reference\n   any additional\
    \ text associated with the address block.\n   The notes in the registry may include\
    \ a summary of previous\n   disposition status values associated with an address\
    \ block, as this\n   summary is specifically not included in the registry table.\
    \  The\n   notes are numbered sequentially.\n   The reference section uses a conventional\
    \ citation format.  The\n   references include documents referenced in the registry\
    \ table and\n   documents referenced in the notes.\n   -----------------------------------------------------\n\

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Security of the Internet's routing system relies\
    \ on the ability to\n   authenticate an assertion of unique control of an address\
    \ block.\n   Measures to authenticate such assertions rely on validation that\
    \ the\n   address block forms part of an existing allocated address block, and\n\
    \   that there is a trustable reference from the IANA address registry to\n  \
    \ the RIR, and a trustable reference from the RIR's registry to a Local\n   Internet\
    \ Registry or end-user Internet Service Provider.\n   The proposed format for\
    \ the IANA registry is a small step towards the\n   creation of a registry that\
    \ can be used as a trust point for\n   commencing a chain of address validation.\
    \  Consideration should be\n   given to IANA registry publication formats that\
    \ are machine\n   parseable, and also the use of file signatures and associated\n\
    \   certificate mechanisms to allow applications to confirm that the\n   registry\
