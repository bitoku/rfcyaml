  - "1.  Introduction\n   As indicated in [OVERVIEW], it has been anticipated that\
    \ WebRTC will\n   not remain an isolated island and that some WebRTC endpoints\
    \ will\n   need to communicate with devices used in other existing networks with\n\
    \   the help of a gateway.  Therefore, in order to maximize the\n   possibility\
    \ of establishing the session without the need for audio\n   transcoding, it is\
    \ recommended in [RFC7874] to include in the offer\n   other suitable audio codecs\
    \ beyond those that are mandatory to\n   implement.  This document provides some\
    \ guidelines on the suitable\n   codecs to be considered for WebRTC endpoints\
    \ to address the use cases\n   most relevant to interoperability.\n   The codecs\
    \ considered in this document are recommended to be\n   supported and included\
    \ in the offer, only for WebRTC endpoints for\n   which interoperability with\
    \ other non-WebRTC endpoints and non-\n   WebRTC-based services is relevant as\
    \ described in Sections 4.1.2,\n   4.2.2, and 4.3.2.  Other use cases may justify\
    \ offering other\n   additional codecs to avoid transcoding.\n"

- title: 3.  Rationale for Additional WebRTC Codecs
  contents:
  - "3.  Rationale for Additional WebRTC Codecs\n   The mandatory implementation of\
    \ Opus [RFC6716] in WebRTC endpoints\n   can guarantee codec interoperability\
    \ (without transcoding) at state-\n   of-the-art voice quality (better than narrow-band\
    \ \"PSTN\" quality)\n   between WebRTC endpoints.  The WebRTC technology is also\
    \ expected to\n   be used to communicate with other types of endpoints using other\n\
    \   technologies.  It can be used for instance as an access technology to\n  \
    \ VoLTE services (Voice over LTE as specified in [IR.92]) or to\n   interoperate\
    \ with fixed or mobile Circuit-Switched or VoIP services\n   like mobile Circuit-Switched\
    \ voice over 3GPP 2G/3G mobile networks\n   [TS23.002] or DECT-based VoIP telephony\
    \ [EN300175-1].  Consequently,\n   a significant number of calls are likely to\
    \ occur between terminals\n   supporting WebRTC endpoints and other terminals\
    \ like mobile handsets,\n   fixed VoIP terminals, and DECT terminals that do not\
    \ support WebRTC\n   endpoints nor implement Opus.  As a consequence, these calls\
    \ are\n   likely to be either of low narrow-band PSTN quality using G.711\n  \
    \ [G.711] at both ends or affected by transcoding operations.  The\n   drawback\
    \ of such transcoding operations are listed below:\n   o  Degraded user experience\
    \ with respect to voice quality: voice\n      quality is significantly degraded\
    \ by transcoding.  For instance,\n      the degradation is around 0.2 to 0.3 MOS\
    \ for most of the\n      transcoding use cases with AMR-WB codec (Section 4.1)\
    \ at 12.65\n      kbit/s and in the same range for other wideband transcoding\
    \ cases.\n      It should be stressed that if G.711 is used as a fallback codec\n\
    \      for interoperation, wideband voice quality will be lost.  Such\n      bandwidth\
    \ reduction effect down to narrow band clearly degrades\n      the user-perceived\
    \ quality of service leading to shorter and less\n      frequent calls.  Such\
    \ a switch to G.711 is a choice for customers.\n      If transcoding is performed\
    \ between Opus and any other wideband\n      codec, wideband communication could\
    \ be maintained but with\n      degraded quality (MOSs of transcoding between\
    \ AMR-WB at 12.65\n      kbit/s and Opus at 16 kbit/s in both directions are significantly\n\
    \      lower than those of AMR-WB at 12.65 kbit/s or Opus at 16 kbit/s).\n   \
    \   Furthermore, in degraded conditions, the addition of defects, like\n     \
    \ (a) audio artifacts due to packet losses and (b) audio effects due\n      to\
    \ the cascading of different packet loss recovery algorithms, may\n      result\
    \ in a quality below the acceptable limit for the customers.\n   o  Degraded user\
    \ experience with respect to conversational\n      interactivity: the degradation\
    \ of conversational interactivity is\n      due to the increase of end-to-end\
    \ latency for both directions that\n      is introduced by the transcoding operations.\
    \  Transcoding requires\n      full de-packetization for decoding of the media\
    \ stream (including\n      mechanisms of de-jitter buffering and packet loss recovery)\
    \ then\n      re-encoding, re-packetization, and resending.  The delays produced\n\
    \      by all these operations are additive and may increase the end-to-\n   \
    \   end delay up to 1 second, much beyond the acceptable limit.\n   o  Additional\
    \ cost in networks: transcoding places important\n      additional cost on network\
    \ gateways mainly related to codec\n      implementation, codecs licenses, deployment,\
    \ testing and\n      validation cost.  It must be noted that transcoding of wideband\
    \ to\n      wideband would require more CPU processing and be more costly than\n\
    \      transcoding between narrowband codecs.\n"
