  - "1.  Introduction\n   PPP has three main components:\n      1. A method for encapsulating\
    \ datagrams over serial links.\n      2. A Link Control Protocol (LCP) for establishing,\

    \ of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing\n         and configuring\
    \ different network-layer protocols.\n   In order to establish communications\
    \ over a point-to-point link, each\n   end of the PPP link must first send LCP\
    \ packets to configure and test\n   the data link.  After the link has been established\
    \ and optional\n   facilities have been negotiated as needed by the LCP, PPP must\
    \ send\n   NCP packets to choose and configure one or more network-layer\n   protocols.\

    \ from each network-layer protocol can be sent\n   over the link.\n   The link\

- title: 1.1.  OSI Network Layer Protocols over PPP
  contents:
  - "1.1.  OSI Network Layer Protocols over PPP\n   A number of protocols have been\
    \ defined for the Network Layer of OSI,\n   including the Connectionless Network\
    \ Layer Protocol (CLNP, ISO 8473)\n   [3], the End System to Intermediate System\
    \ routing protocol (ES-IS,\n   ISO 9542) [4], the Intermediate System to Intermediate\
    \ System routing\n   protocol (IS-IS, ISO 10589) [5], and the Inter-Domain Routeing\n\
    \   Protocol (IDRP, CD 10747) [6].  Generally, these protocols were\n   designed\
    \ to run over non-reliable data link protocols such as PPP.\n   Network Layer\
    \ Protocol Identifier (NLPID)\n      OSI Network Layer protocols can be discriminated\
    \ according to the\n      first octet in each Network Protocol Data Unit (NPDU,\
    \ that is,\n      packet), known as the Network Layer Protocol Identifier (NLPID),\n\
    \      which is defined in ISO/TR 9577 [7].  This allows the various\n      protocols\
    \ to be run over a common data link without any\n      discriminator below the\
    \ network layer.\n   Inactive Network Layer Protocol\n      ISO/TR 9577 reserves\
    \ a NLPID value of zero to represent the\n      \"Inactive Network Layer Protocol\"\
    , as defined in ISO 8473.  The\n      inactive network layer protocol MUST NOT\
    \ be used over PPP.  This\n      assures that whichever OSI network layer protocol\
    \ is used will\n      have a non-zero NLPID value.\n   Connection-Oriented Network\
    \ Protocol\n      The OSI Connection-Oriented Network Protocol (ISO 8208) [8],\n\
    \      effectively the Packet Layer of CCITT X.25, is intended to be run\n   \
    \   over a reliable data link, such as IEEE 802.2 type II or LAPB.\n      Therefore,\
    \ the unreliable data link service provided by PPP is not\n      appropriate for\
    \ use with ISO 8208.\n   ConnectionLess Network Protocol (CLNP)\n      The ConnectionLess\
    \ Network Protocol offers a simple non-reliable\n      datagram service very similar\
    \ to IP, and is designed to run over a\n      non-reliable data link service,\
    \ such as provided by PPP.\n   End-System to Intermediate-System Protocol (ES-IS)\n\
    \      ES Hellos and IS Hellos are retransmitted on a periodic timer-\n      driven\
    \ basis (based on expiration of the \"Configuration Timer\").\n      The resulting\
    \ ES and IS configuration information is invalidated\n      on a timer driven\
    \ basis, based on expiration of the \"Holding\n      Timer\" for each piece of\
    \ information.  The value of a Holding\n      Timer is set by the source of the\
    \ information, and transmitted in\n      the Holding Time field of the appropriate\
    \ ES-IS packet.  ISO 9542\n      recommends that the holding time field is set\
    \ to approximately\n      twice the Configuration Timer parameter, such that even\
    \ if every\n      other Hello packet is lost the configuration information will\
    \ be\n      retained (implying that the Holding Timer is actually set to\n   \
    \   slightly more than twice the Configuration Timer).\n      Generally, the recommendation\
    \ in ISO 9542 is sufficient for PPP\n      links.  For very unreliable links,\
    \ it may be necessary to set the\n      Holding Timer to be slightly more than\
    \ three times the\n      Configuration Timer to ensure that loss of configuration\n\
    \      information is an unusual event.\n      Redirect information is not transmitted\
    \ on point-to-point links,\n      but may be transmitted on general topology subnetworks,\
    \ which in\n      turn may make use of PPP.  Redirect information is sent on a\n\
    \      event-driven basis (based on a CLNP packet being forwarded by a\n     \
    \ router out the incoming interface), but redirect information is\n      invalidated\
    \ on a timer-driven basis.  Loss of a single redirect\n      may result in a subsequent\
    \ data packet being sent to the same\n      incorrect router, which will re-issue\
    \ the redirect.  This operates\n      in the same manner as ICMP redirects for\
    \ IP packets, and does not\n      pose any problem for operation over PPP links.\n\
    \   Intermediate-System to Intermediate-System Protocol (IS-IS)\n      IS-IS allows\
    \ for broadcast links (typically LANs), point-to-point\n      links (such as PPP),\
    \ and general topology links (such as X.25\n      networks) which are modelled\
    \ as a collection of point-to-point\n      links.\n      There are four types\
    \ of IS-IS packets: IS-IS Hello Packets, Link\n      State Packets (LSPs), Complete\
    \ Sequence Number Packets (CSNPs),\n      and Partial Sequence Number Packets\
    \ (PSNPs).\n      IS-IS Hello messages are transmitted periodically on point-to-\n\
    \      point links (based on expiration of the \"ISISHello\" timer).\n      Routers\
    \ expect to receive IS-IS Hello packets periodically.\n      Specifically, the\
    \ IS-IS Hello packet specifies a \"Holding Time\".\n      If no subsequent IS-IS\
    \ Hello is received over the corresponding\n      link for the specified time\
    \ period, then the neighboring router is\n      assumed to have been disconnected\
    \ or to be down.  It is highly\n      undesireable for links to \"flap\" up and\
    \ down unnecessarily, which\n      implies that the holding time needs to be large\
    \ enough that a link\n      is very unlikely to be declared down due to a failure\
    \ to receive\n      an IS-IS Hello.  This implies that running IS-IS over unreliable\n\
    \      data links requires the Holding time to be greater than \"k\" times\n \
    \     the ISISHello timer, where k is chosen such that the loss of k\n      consecutive\
    \ IS-IS Hello's is rare.  If the quality of the link is\n      poor, then the\
    \ Holding Time will need to be increased or the\n      \"ISISHello\" time decreased.\n\
    \      LSPs are acknowledged by the IS-IS protocol (via use of partial\n     \
    \ sequence number packets).  A lost LSP will be recovered from with\n      no\
    \ problem provided that PPP links are treated the same way as\n      other point-to-point\
    \ links.  On those rare occasions where a\n      partial sequence number packet\
    \ is lost, this might result in the\n      retransmission of a link state packet\
    \ over a single link, but will\n      not impact the correct operation of the\
    \ routing algorithm.\n      CSNPs are sent upon link startup on a point-to-point\
    \ link.  This\n      does not need to be changed for PPP.  If a CSNP fragment\
    \ is lost\n      upon startup it is merely loss of an optimization -- LSPs that\
    \ did\n      not need to be transmitted over the link will be transmitted.  If\n\
    \      a periodic CSNP fragment is lost it merely means that detection of\n  \
    \    low probability database corruption will take longer.\n      PSNPs function\
    \ as ACKs.  Loss of a PSNP may result in an\n      unnecessary retransmission\
    \ of an LSP, but does not prevent correct\n      operation of the routing protocol.\n\
    \   Inter-Domain Routeing Protocol (IDRP)\n      IDRP expects to run over datagram\
    \ links, but requires reliable\n      exchange of IDRP information.  For this\
    \ reason, IDRP contains\n      built-in reliability mechanisms which ensure that\
    \ packets will be\n      received correctly.\n"

    \  OSINLCP\n   packets may not be exchanged until PPP has reached the Network-Layer\n\

  - "2.1.  Sending OSI NPDUs\n   Before any Network Protocol Data Units (NPDUs) may\
    \ be communicated,\n   PPP must reach the Network-Layer Protocol phase, and the\

    \ the\n   same as the maximum length of the Information field of a PPP data\n\
    \   link layer frame.  Larger NPDUs must be segmented as necessary.  If a\n  \
    \ system wishes to avoid segmentation and reassembly, it should use\n   transport\
    \ layer mechanisms to discourage others from sending large\n   PDUs.\n"
- title: 2.2.  NPDU Alignment
  contents:
  - "2.2.  NPDU Alignment\n   OSI protocols have peculiar alignment problems due to\
    \ the fact that\n   they are often encapsulated in data link protocols with odd-length\n\
    \   headers, while PPP defaults to even-length headers.  A router\n   switching\
    \ an OSI packet may find that the beginning of the packet\n   falls on an inconvenient\
    \ memory boundary when the hardware used to\n   transmit the packet to its next\
    \ hop requires a particular alignment.\n   This situation can be addressed by\
    \ the use of leading zero padding.\n   When sending, an implementation MAY insert\
    \ one to three octets of\n   zero between the PPP header and the OSI NPDU.  These\
    \ zero octets\n   correspondingly reduce the maximum length of the NPDU that may\
    \ be\n   transmitted.\n   On reception, any such leading zero octets (if present)\
    \ MUST be\n   removed.  Regardless of whether leading zero padding is used, an\n\
    \   implementation MUST also be able to receive a PPP packet with any\n   arbitrary\
    \ alignment of the NPDU.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Align-NPDU
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Align-NPDU\n   Description\n      This Configuration Option provides a\
    \ way for the receiver to\n      negotiate a particular alignment of the OSI NPDU.\
    \  Empirical\n      evidence suggests that the greatest time deficit for re-alignment\n\
    \      exists at the receiver.\n      The alignment is accomplished through combination\
    \ of PPP header\n      compression with leading zero padding (see above).  It\
    \ is\n      recommended that alignment be entirely through header compression\n\
    \      combinations whenever possible.  For example, an alignment of 3\n     \
    \ could be achieved by combining uncompressed PPP Address and\n      Control fields\
    \ (2 octets) with a compressed PPP Protocol field (1\n      octet).\n      This\
    \ option is negotiated separately in each direction.  A\n      receiver which\
    \ does not need alignment MUST NOT request the\n      option.  A sender which\
    \ desires alignment prior to sending SHOULD\n      Configure-Nak with an appropriate\
    \ value.\n         Implementation Note: In a complex environment, there might\
    \ be\n         several conflicting needs for alignment.  It is recommended\n \
    \        that the receiver request alignment based on the needs of the\n     \
    \    highest speed next hop link.  Also, greater efficiency might be\n       \
    \  obtained by negotiating upstream the values requested by\n         downstream\
    \ PPP links, since those packets will not need a\n         change in alignment\
    \ on transit.\n      The alignment request is advisory, and failure to agree on\
    \ an\n      alignment MUST NOT prevent the OSINLCP from reaching the Opened\n\
    \      state.  By default, the alignment is done according to the needs\n    \
    \  of the sender, and all receivers MUST be capable of accepting\n      packets\
    \ with any alignment.\n         Vernacular: If you don't like this option, you\
    \ can refuse to\n         negotiate it, and you can send whatever alignment you\
    \ want.\n         However, if you accept the peer's alignment option, then you\n\
    \         MUST transmit packets with the agreed alignment.\n   A summary of the\
    \ Align-NPDU Configuration Option format is shown\n   below.  The fields are transmitted\
    \ from left to right.\n    0                   1                   2\n    0 1\

    \   Type\n      1\n   Length\n      3\n   Alignment\n      This field specifies\
    \ the offset of the beginning of the OSI NPDU\n      relative to the beginning\
    \ of the PPP packet header (not including\n      any leading Flag Sequences).\n\
    \      A value of 1 through 4 requires an offset of that specific length,\n  \
    \    modulo 4.  For example, a value of 1 would require no padding when\n    \
    \  the PPP Address, Control, and Protocol fields are compressed.  One\n      octet\
    \ of leading zero padding would be necessary when the PPP\n      header is full\
    \ sized.\n      A value of 255 requests an offset of an odd length (1 or 3). \
    \ A\n      value of 254 requests an offset of an even length (2 or 4).  If\n \
    \     the sender is not capable of dynamically varying the amount of\n      padding,\
    \ it MUST NAK with one of the two specific values.\n"
