- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   For many years the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)\n\
    \   (www.iana.org) has allocated parameter values for fields in protocols\n  \
    \ which have been created or are maintained by the Internet Engineering\n   Task\
    \ Force (IETF).  Starting a few years ago the IETF began to\n   provide the IANA\
    \ with guidance for the assignment of parameters for\n   fields in newly developed\
    \ protocols.  Unfortunately this type of\n   guidance was not consistently provided\
    \ for the fields in protocols\n   developed before 1998.  This memo attempts to\
    \ codify existing IANA\n   practice used in the assignment of parameters in the\
    \ specific case of\n   some of these protocols.  It is expected that additional\
    \ memos will\n   be developed in the future to codify existing practice in other\n\
    \   cases.\n   This memo addresses the fields within the IPv4, IPv6, ICMP, UDP\
    \ and\n   TCP protocol headers for which the IANA assigns values.\n   The terms\
    \ \"Specification Required\", \"Expert Review\", \"IESG Approval\",\n   \"IETF\
    \ Consensus\", and \"Standards Action\", are used in this memo to\n   refer to\
    \ the processes described in [CONS].\n"
- title: 2. Temporary Assignments
  contents:
  - "2. Temporary Assignments\n   From time to time temporary assignments are made\
    \ in the values for\n   fields in these headers for use in experiments.  IESG\
    \ Approval is\n   required for any such temporary assignments.\n"
- title: 3. Version field in the IP header.
  contents:
  - "3. Version field in the IP header.\n   The first field in the IP header of all\
    \ current versions of IP is the\n   Version field.  New values in the Version\
    \ field define new versions\n   of the IP protocol and are allocated only after\
    \ an IETF Standards\n   Action.  It should be noted that some of the Version number\
    \ bits are\n   used by TCP/IP header compression schemes. Specifically, the hi-order\n\
    \   bit of the Version field is also used by TCP/IP header compression\n   [HC],\
    \ while the three hi-order bits are used by IP Header Compression\n   [IPHC].\n"
- title: 4. IANA Considerations for fields in the IPv4 header
  contents:
  - "4. IANA Considerations for fields in the IPv4 header\n   The IPv4 header [V4]\
    \ contains the following fields that carry values\n   assigned by the IANA: Version,\
    \ Type of Service, Protocol, Source\n   Address, Destination Address, and Option\
    \ Type.\n"
- title: 4.1 IPv4 IP Version field
  contents:
  - "4.1 IPv4 IP Version field\n   The IPv4 Version field is always 4.\n"
- title: 4.2 IPv4 Type of Service field
  contents:
  - "4.2 IPv4 Type of Service field\n   The Type of Service field described in [V4]\
    \ has been superseded[DIFF]\n   by the 6-bit Differentiated Services (DS) field\
    \ and a 2-bit field\n   which is currently reserved.  The IANA allocates values\
    \ in the DS\n   field following the IANA Considerations section in [DIFF].  [ECN]\n\
    \   describes an experimental use of the 2-bit \"currently unused\" field.\n \
    \  Other experimental uses of this field may be assigned after IESG\n   Approval\
    \ processes.  Permanent values in this field are allocated\n   following a Standards\
    \ Action process.\n"
- title: 4.3 IPv4 Protocol field
  contents:
  - "4.3 IPv4 Protocol field\n   IANA allocates values from the IPv4 Protocol name\
    \ space following an\n   Expert Review, IESG Approval or Standards Action process.\
    \  The Expert\n   Review process should only be used in those special cases where\
    \ non-\n   disclosure information is involved.  In these cases the expert(s)\n\
    \   should be designated by the IESG.\n"
- title: 4.4 IPv4 Source and Destination addresses
  contents:
  - "4.4 IPv4 Source and Destination addresses\n   The IPv4 source and destination\
    \ addresses use the same namespace but\n   do not necessarily use the same values.\
    \  Values in these fields fall\n   into a number of ranges defined in [V4] and\
    \ [MULT].\n"
- title: 4.4.1 IPv4 Unicast addresses
  contents:
  - "4.4.1 IPv4 Unicast addresses\n   The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names\
    \ and Numbers (ICANN)\n   recently accepted responsibility for the formulation\
    \ of specific\n   guidelines for the allocation of the values from the IPv4 unicast\n\
    \   address space (values 0.0.0.0 through 223.255.255.255 ) other than\n   values\
    \ from the ranges 0/8 (which was reserved in [AN80]) and 127/8\n   (from which\
    \ the loopback address has been taken) along with other\n   values already assigned\
    \ by the IETF for special functions or\n   purposes. (For example, the private\
    \ addresses defined in RFC 1918.)\n   Further assignments in the 0/8 and 127/8\
    \ ranges require a Standards\n   Action process since current IP implementations\
    \ may break if this is\n   done.\n"
- title: 4.4.2 IPv4 Multicast addresses
  contents:
  - "4.4.2 IPv4 Multicast addresses\n   IPv4 addresses that fall in the range from\
    \ 224.0.0.0 through\n   239.255.255.255 are known as multicast addresses.  The\
    \ IETF through\n   its normal processes has assigned a number of IPv4 multicast\n\
    \   addresses for special purposes. For example, [ADSCP] assigned a\n   number\
    \ of IPv4 multicast address to correspond to IPv6 scoped\n   multicast addresses.\
    \  Also, the values in the range from 224.0.0.0 to\n   224.0.0.255 , inclusive,\
    \ are reserved by the IANA for the use of\n   routing protocols and other low-level\
    \ topology discovery or\n   maintenance protocols, such as gateway discovery and\
    \ group membership\n   reporting. (See the IANA web page) New values in this range\
    \ are\n   assigned following an IESG Approval or Standards Action process.\n \
    \  Assignments of individual multicast address follow an Expert Review,\n   IESG\
    \ Approval or Standards Action process.  Until further work is\n   done on multicast\
    \ protocols, large-scale assignments of IPv4\n   multicast addresses is not recommended.\n\
    \   From time to time, there are requests for temporary assignment of\n   multicast\
    \ space for experimental purposes.  These will originate in\n   an IESG Approval\
    \ process and should be for a limited duration such as\n   one year.\n"
- title: 4.4.3 IPv4 Reserved addresses
  contents:
  - "4.4.3 IPv4 Reserved addresses\n   IPv4 addresses in the range from 240.0.0.0\
    \ through 255.255.255.254\n   are reserved [AN81, MULT] and compliant IPv4 implementations\
    \ will\n   discard any packets that make use of them.  Addresses in this range\n\
    \   are not to be assigned unless an IETF Standards Action modifies the\n   IPv4\
