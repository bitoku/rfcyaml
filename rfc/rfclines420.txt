AVAILABILITY 'WEATHER' (THE LISP HALF) IS A REAL MACHINE
USER BOTH CPU AND CORE.
THAT YOU RUN IT ON YOUR MACHINE.
IF WE ARE REALLY EMPTY
(WHICH FREQUENTLY HAPPENS AT 3 AM)
FEEL FREE TO RUN IT ON OUR MACHINE.
SINCE OUR SYSTEM HAS NO DRUM, AND WEATHER TAKES ALL OF CORE, PLEASE CHECK WITH SOMEBODY
BEFORE RUNNING WEATHER IF WE ARE DOING ANYTHING AT ALL.
A MAJOR LOAD ON OUR MACHINE.
SINCE THE DATACOMPUTER IS LESS OF A LOAD, THE SYSTEM WILL BE MORE AVAILABLE
IF YOU CAN RUN 'WEATHER' ON YOUR MACHINE.
WE WILL TRY TO RUN THE DATACOMPUTER DURING NON PRIME TIME.
IT CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS
THE SERVER HALF OF THIS COMBINATION.
HERE IS 1 TO 5 PM EASTERN TIME, BUT THE MORNING IS FREQUENTLY QUITE BUSY TOO.
PLEASE DO NOT USE THE DATACOMPUTER DURING THIS TIME.
IT WILL SAVE US THE EFFORT OF TURNING IT OFF.
CAN RUN A LIMITATION OF THE DATACOMPUTER THAT WILL GO AWAY SOMEDAY.
IF YOU WANT TO RUN A DEMO (NOT JUST PLAY AROUND)
WE WILL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO COOPERATE.
PLEASE CALL TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS WELL IN ADVANCE.
WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT TRY TO GIVE AN IMPORTANT DEMO UNLESS YOU HAVE USED BOTH VERSIONS OF THE SYSTEMS
THAT WILL BE USED FOR THE DEMO.
EVEN WE GET IN TROUBLE WHEN WE FORGET TO REHEARSE THINGS A BIT.
WEDNESDAY MORNING IS SCHEDULED PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE TIME.
OUR MACHINE WILL NOT BE UP BETWWEN 9 AND 12, BUT
IT FREQUENTLY IS DOWN PAST NOON.
MORE INFORMATION FOR THE LATEST INFORMATION, LOOK AT  .TXT
IN <WDB DEMO> AT CCA.
IN PARTICULAR, MESSAGE.TXT SHOULD BE A QUICK SUMMARY OF ANY OTHER INTERESTING TXT FILES.
THE LATEST VERSION OF THIS FILE (IN RUNOFF FORMAT) IS <HGM MEMOS
THE LATEST VERSION OF THE LISP PROGRAM WILL BE IN <WDB DEMO>
NORMAL FTP CAN BE USED TO COPY IT
IT TAKES 6 MIN TO TRANSFER IT
TO OURSELVES (1.5 MIN OF CPU, 22KBAUD)
WHEN THE MACHINE IS VERY LIGHLY LOADED.
BE SURE TO SET THE BYTE SIZE TO 36
SINCE THIS IS A SAVE FILE.
IF YOU FIND ANY PROBLEMS WITH LISP HALF, PLEASE USE SNDMSG TO SEND THINGS TO JEFF HILL
WE ARE INTERESTED IN EXAMPLES
WHICH LOOK LIKE THEY SHOULD WORK
BUT DON'T.  IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT GENERAL OPERATIONS GLITCHES
THE DATACOMPUTER IS NOT UP BITCH TO ME
CCA IS HOST 31 DECIMAL, 37 OCTAL.
USING THE SYSTEM AFTER STARTING WEATHER, THE SYSTEM WILL INITIALIZE ITSELF, TYPE OUT SOME MESSAGES, AND ASK FOR THE JULIAN DATE (REALLY THE DAY NUMBER OF THE YEAR OF 'TODAY').
300 IS THE BEST ANSWER.
THAT MAKES 'TODAY' BE OCT 26, THE LAST DAY OF THE ICCC DEMO, AND ONE DAY PAST THE LATEST DATA.
IF YOU TYPE SOME OTHER NUMBER, 'YESTERDAY', AND 'LAST WEEK' WON'T WORK AS WELL.
THE SYSTEM PROMPTS WITH 'READY' WHEN IT IS READY TO ACCEPT A SENTENCE.
BE SURE TO END THE SENTENCE WITH THE PROPER PUNCTUATION.
SENTENCES MAY BE EDITED WITH: ^A (CONTROL A)   DELETES LAST CHARACTER OR
AS CONTROL Q IN ADDITION
, TWO CONTROL CHARACTERS CAN BE USED DURING THE PROCESSING OF SENTENCES, ^E (CONTROL E) ABORTS THE PROCESSING OF THE SENTENCE AND RETURNS TO THE READY STATE.
ABORTS THE WHOLE SYSTEM, AND CAUSES IT TO RE INITIALIZE ITSELF.
DURING SENTENCE INPUT, THE SYSTEM ATTEMPTS TO LOOK UP EACH WORD AS IT IS TYPED, AND DO SPELLING CORRECTION.
HOWEVER, SINCE THE NAMES OF ALL THE CITIES ARE KEPT AT THE DATACOMPUTER, THE SYSTEM ACCEPTS ALL UNKNOWN WORDS
LATER ON IN THE PROCESSING.
IF THE SPELLING CORRECTOR CORRECTS ONE OF YOUR CITY
NAMES TO A VOCABULARY WORD, YOU CAN ERASE THE WORD AND RETYPE
THIS FORCES THE SYSTEM TO ACCEPT THE WORD AS A PROPER NOUN.
THE SYSTEM RETURNS TO THE READY STATE AFTER ANSWERING THE QUESTION.
, WHICH WILL LEAVE YOU BACK AT THE TENEX COMMAND LEVEL.
IF THE SYSTEM CANNOT UNDERSTAND YOUR REQUEST
, IT TRIES TO GIVE YOU SOME EXPLANATORY MESSAGE.
SO YOU WILL USUALLY GET THE DEFAULT MESSAGE 'SORRY,
YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHY, SEND US A TRANSCRIPTIPT OF YOUR SESSION.
THE SYSTEM IS NOT LINGUISTICALLY SOPHISTICATED.
WHICH WOULD BE CONSIDERED SIMPLE REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION.
, RATHER IT UNDERSTANDS HOW TO COMPOSE RETRIEVAL REQUESTS FOR WEATHER DATA IN ITS DATA BASE.
A LARGE SET OF EXAMPLE SENTENCES
CAN BE FOUND IN <WDB  DEMO>SENTENCES.TXT.
THOSE SENTENCES PRECEDE BY A BACKSLASH (\)
SOME OF THE OTHERS MAY NOT WORK EITHER.
WHAT DAY WAS YESTERDAY?' '
WHAT CITIES ARE IN MASSACHUSETTS?'
'IT' IS NOT WORKING TOO
IF YOU GET IN TROUBLE, TRY SOMETHING WITHOU 'IT'
THAT IS KNOWN TO WORK.
WHAT WAS THE TEMPERATURE IN BOSTON YESTERDAY?'
WE ARE QUITE APT TO TEST
THE SYSTEM DOES NOT KNOW ABOUT THE WORD 'SNOW'.
THERE IS NO WAY TO LIST ITS VOCABULARY.
HOWEVER, THE SENTENCES IN SENTENCES.TXT SHOULD GIVE YOU A GOOD IDEA OF THE WORDS THE SYSTEM UNDESTANDS.
THE AVERAGE TIME FOR UNDERSTANDING AND ANSWERING
A QUESTION IS ABOUT 1 MINUTE.
IF THE SYSTEM TAKES MUCH LONGER THAN THIS
IF YOU ASK A VERY BIG QUESTION, LIKE '
WHAT WAS THE HOTTEST PLACE IN CANADA?'
, THE LISP SYSTEM MAY GO INTO A GC (GARBAGE COLLENTION)
ALL OVER (WITH ^D) WILL BE OK, BUT THE DATACOMPUTER MAY TAKE A LONG TIME TO RECOVER
(YET) NOTICE THAT ANYTHING HAS GONE
IT ASKS FOR MORE INPUT.
THE DATA FROM OCT 1 THRU 16 IS ALMOST COMPLETE.
BETWEEN OCT 17 TO 25
WE PLAN TO RELOAD EVERYTHING SOMETIME
, SO WE WILL HAVE A COMPLETE MONTH OF CLEAN DATA.
THIS DATA HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY SUMMARIZED
THE OCTOBER DATA IS ABOUT 2400 PAGES OF REAL DATA,
ABOUT 200 MORE FOR THE INVERSION.
THERE ARE ABOUT 4000 CITIES.
THE CITY NAMES HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO THE LOCAL CITY WHENEVER
'BOSTON' IS 'BOSTON' NOT 'LOGAN'. '
SAMPLE DATALANGUAGE THESE EXAMPLES ON THIS AND THE FOLLOWING PAGES WORK ON A VERY OLD VERSION OF THE DATACOMPUTER.
THEY ARE NOT THE FINAL FORM OF DATALANGUAGE THAT SHOULD BA AVAILABLE SOON.
THE FOLLOWING QUESTION TO 'WEATHER' GENERATED TWO REQUESTS TO THE DATACOMPUTER.
IS A VALID CITY NAME, AND THE SECOND USES THE ANSWER PORT TO RETRIEVE THE DATA.
THE ACTUAL REQUESTS THAT ARE SENT TO THE DATACOMPUTER DO NOT HAVE THE CARRIAGE RETURNS THAT MAKE THEM READABLE THEY ARE SENT AS ONE VERY LONG LINE.
THE '^Z' IS THE END OF DATA MARKER.
