- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   As Internet messaging evolves into unified messaging, the\
    \ term\n   \"e-mail\" no longer refers to text-only messages.  Today's \"e-mail\"\
    \n   are often multi-media.  That is, they can have numerous non-text\n   parts.\
    \  These parts can be attachments or can contain voice and/or\n   fax.\n   Each\
    \ of voice, fax, and text have their own distinct characteristics,\n   which are\
    \ intuitive to the user.  For example, each of these message\n   types require\
    \ a different media viewer (text editor for text, audio\n   player for voice,\
    \ and image viewer for fax), and the dimensions of\n   message size are also different\
    \ for all three (kilobytes for text,\n   seconds for voice, and pages for fax).\
    \  As a result, a message that\n   includes more than one of these in its parts\
    \ is termed a mixed media\n   message.\n   How the messaging client responds to,\
    \ and acts on these differences\n   is termed \"Client Behaviour\".  This is dependent\
    \ on the concept of\n   \"Message-Context\" [2] (previously called primary content),\
    \ which\n   defines whether the message is a voice mail, fax, or text message.\n\
    \   The client can utilize this header to determine the appropriate\n   client\
    \ behaviour for a particular message.\n   Traditionally, a messaging \"client\"\
    \ referred to some sort of visual\n   interface (or GUI - graphical user interface)\
    \ that was presented on\n   the users computer.  However, as messaging evolves\
    \ to unified\n   communications the actual form of the messaging client is expected\
    \ to\n   change.  Today's email can often be viewed on wireless devices with\n\
    \   very limited screens or even \"viewed\" over a telephone (i.e.,\n   listening\
    \ to email as you would listen to voice mail through a TUI -\n   telset user interface).\n\
    \   The intent of this document is to be general and refer to all types\n   of\
    \ messaging clients, as the user's expectation of behaviour based on\n   the type\
    \ of message is not expected to change.  However, some of the\n   following concepts\
    \ may tend towards the more common GUI client.\n"

  - "2.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   In examples, \"C:\" and \"S:\" indicate\
    \ lines sent by the client and\n   server respectively.\n   The key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to\
    \ be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [4].\n"
- title: 3.  Message Icon
  contents:
  - "3.  Message Icon\n   The preferred method to distinguish between voice, fax,\
    \ and text\n   messages on a GUI client is with a visual cue, or icon.  A similar\n\
    \   voice prompt or \"earcon\" would be used for TUI clients.\n   As it is possible\
    \ for the message to contain more than one media\n   type, the icon should describe\
    \ the primary message content, as\n   defined by the \"Message-Context\" header.\
    \  Obvious choices for the\n   icon/message pairs would be a telephone for a voice\
    \ message, a fax\n   machine for a fax message, and an envelope for a text mail\
    \ message.\n   Similarly obvious for the earcons would be short spoken prompts\
    \ like\n   \"voice message\".\n   This could be taken a step further, and have\
    \ the GUI icon change to\n   indicate that the message has been read as is currently\
    \ done in some\n   email clients (others do not change the icon but merely bold\
    \ the\n   message in the message list to indicate it is unread).  For example,\n\
    \   a telephone with the receiver off-hook could indicate that the voice\n   message\
    \ has been played.  A fax machine with paper at the bottom, as\n   opposed to\
    \ the top, would show that the fax had been viewed.\n   Finally, an open envelope\
    \ indicates that a text message has been\n   read.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Proposed Mechanism
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Proposed Mechanism\n   As the choice of icon is determined by the primary\
    \ message type, the\n   client should obtain this information from the \"Message-Context\
    \ \"\n   message header.  This header is defined in [2].\n"
- title: 4.  Sender's Number Column
  contents:
  - "4.  Sender's Number Column\n   As is the case with most email GUI clients today,\
    \ important message\n   information is organized into columns when presented to\
    \ the user in a\n   the summary message list.  TUIs often present even briefer\
    \ summaries\n   to the user at the beginning of the session.  Typical columns\
    \ in the\n   GUI client include the message subject, and the date the message\
    \ was\n   received.\n   Another important piece of information for the user is\
    \ the origin of\n   the message.  For a voice or fax message, the origin is typically\
    \ a\n   telephone or fax machine respectively, each of which has an\n   associated\
    \ telephone number.  This telephone number is critical to\n   the user if they\
    \ wish to return the call.  This should be presented\n   accurately to the user\
    \ (without making it an email address).\n"
- title: 4.1.  Proposed Mechanism
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Proposed Mechanism\n   Instead of forcing the telephone number into an\
    \ email address, a new\n   Internet message header can be used to hold the originating\
    \ telephone\n   number [3].  If the message is indicated as being a voice or fax\n\
    \   message per [2], the client should extract the number, and display it\n  \
    \ to the user in a separate column.  As this header is defined to only\n   hold\
    \ the digits of the telephone number, it is left to the client to\n   add any\
    \ separating characters (e.g., \"-\").\n"
- title: 5.  Message Size
  contents:
  - "5.  Message Size\n   In the cases of large attachments, small clients (e.g.,\
    \ PDA) and slow\n   links (e.g., wireless) there is also a need for the client\
    \ to see the\n   length of the message in a suitable format before opening it.\n\
    \   Currently, message size is normally given in kilobytes (kB).  This\n   is\
    \ sufficient for plain text messages, but while it may give a hint\n   as to how\
    \ good the compression algorithm is, kB is not very useful in\n   knowing the\
    \ size of a voice and/or fax message.  Instead, the size\n   should give an indication\
    \ of the length of the message, i.e., the\n   duration (in seconds) of a voice\
    \ message, and the number of pages of\n   a fax.  Again, the message may contain\
    \ multiple types, so the size\n   displayed should be that of the primary content\
    \ type, per [2].\n"
- title: 5.1.  Proposed Mechanisms
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Proposed Mechanisms\n   There are three suggested methods to relay this\
    \ information, of them,\n   the first method is favored:\n"
- title: 5.1.1.  MIME Header Content-Duration as described in RFC 2424 [5]
  contents:
  - "5.1.1.  MIME Header Content-Duration as described in RFC 2424 [5]\n   For voice\
    \ messages, the Content-Duration field of the main audio/*\n   body part (as indicated\
    \ by content-disposition per [1]) should be\n   displayed as the length of the\
    \ message.  If there are several audio\n   parts, an implementation may display\
    \ the message size as an aggregate\n   of the length of each.\n   For fax messages\
    \ a new MIME Header, Content-Page-Length, could be\n   defined, similar to Content-Duration\
    \ with the exception that number\n   of pages would be specified, rather than\
    \ number of seconds.  (e.g.,\n   Content-Page-Length:3).  This would be created\
    \ at origination.\n"
- title: 5.1.2.  Message length indicated as a parameter of an Existing
  contents:
  - "5.1.2.  Message length indicated as a parameter of an Existing\n        RFC 2045\
    \ [7] Content-Type Header Field\n   This would be created at the source.  This\
    \ proposed method would\n   allow the message length to be passed to the client\
    \ by default in\n   IMAP.  Again the client would have to choose between the main\
    \ voice\n   message length or an aggregate message length for display.\n   Content-Type\
    \ Header Field example:\n   Content-Type=audio/*; length=50\n   Content-Type=image/tiff;\
    \ pages=3\n"
- title: 5.1.3.  Message length indicated as part of an existing RFC 2822 [9]
  contents:
  - "5.1.3.  Message length indicated as part of an existing RFC 2822 [9]\n      \
    \  Header Field\n   This field would be created at the source and may include\
    \ message\n   length information, but because it is part of the message headers,\
    \ it\n   could also be amended on reception (by a local process).  This method\n\
    \   would allow the message length to be passed to any client by default\n   and\
    \ not require any client modification.  If used, this field would\n   indicate\
    \ the aggregate length of all attachments.\n   The advantage of this mechanism\
    \ is that no new headers are required\n   and it works with existing clients.\
    \  The downside is that it\n   overloads the subject field.\n   Subject Header\
    \ Field example:\n   Subject=Voice Message (0:04)\n   Subject=Fax Message (3p)\n\
    \   Subject=Voice Message (0:14) with Fax (1p)\n"
- title: 6.  Media Viewer
  contents:
  - "6.  Media Viewer\n   When a message is initially opened, the client should, by\
    \ default,\n   open the proper media viewer to display the primary message content.\n\
    \   That is, an audio player for voice messages, an image viewer for fax,\n  \
    \ and a text editor for text messages.  Note that on a TUI, the viewer\n   would\
    \ render the media to sound (which would have varying effect\n   depending on\
    \ the media and available process).\n   Where there is more than one body part,\
    \ obviously the appropriate\n   viewer should be used depending on which body\
    \ part the user has\n   selected.\n   In the case where several viewers are available\
    \ for a single media\n   type, the user should be prompted to select the desired\
    \ viewer on the\n   first occasion that the message type is encountered.  That\
    \ viewer\n   should then become the default viewer for that media type.  The user\n\
    \   should have the ability to change the default viewer for a media type\n  \
    \ at any time.\n   Note that it is possible that the media viewer may not be part\
    \ of the\n   client or local to the host of the client.  For example, a user could\n\
    \   select to play a voice message from a GUI and the message is played\n   over\
    \ a telephone (perhaps because the user has no desktop speakers).\n   Additionally,\
    \ a user listening to a unified messaging inbox over a\n   TUI could chose to\
    \ print a particular message to a nearby fax\n   machine.\n"
- title: 6.1.  Proposed Mechanism
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Proposed Mechanism\n   As mentioned, the default viewer displayed to the\
    \ user should be the\n   appropriate one for the primary message type.  The client\
    \ is able to\n   determine the primary message type from the \"Message-Context\"\
    \ message\n   header per [2].\n"
- title: 7.  Mark Message as Read
  contents:
  - "7.  Mark Message as Read\n   Obviously, the user must be able to know which messages\
    \ they have\n   read, and which are unread.  This feature would also control the\n\
    \   message icon or earcon as mentioned in section 1.\n   With the proliferation\
    \ of voice and fax messages, clients should only\n   indicate that these messages\
    \ are read when the primary body part has\n   been read.  For example, a voice\
    \ message should not be indicated as\n   read until the audio part has been played.\
    \  The default is currently\n   to mark a message read, when the first body part\
    \ (typically text) is\n   viewed.\n"
- title: 7.1.  Proposed Mechanism
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Proposed Mechanism\n   Implementation of this feature on most clients is\
    \ a local issue.\n   For example, in the case of IMAP4 [6], these clients should\
    \ only set\n   the \\SEEN flag after the first attachment of the primary content\
    \ type\n   has been opened.  That is, if the message context is voice message,\n\
    \   the \\SEEN flag would be set after the primary voice message\n   (indicated\
    \ by content-disposition [1] or content-criticality [8]) is\n   opened.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   The desirable client behaviours described here\
    \ are intended to\n   provide the user with a better client experience.  However,\n\
    \   supporting the proposed behaviours described in this document does\n   not\
    \ make a client immune from the risks of being a mail client.  That\n   is, the\
    \ client is not responsible for the format of the message\n   received, it only\
    \ interprets.  As a result, messages could be spoofed\n   or masqueraded to look\
    \ like a message they are not to elicit a\n   desired client behaviour.  This\
    \ could be used to fool the end user,\n   for example, into thinking a message\
    \ was a voice message (because of\n   the icon) when it was not.\n"
