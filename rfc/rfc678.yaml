  - "Introduction\n   In an attempt to provide online documents to the network community\
    \ we\n   have had many problems with the physical format of the final\n   documents.\
    \ Much of this difficulty lies in the fact that we do not\n   have control or\
    \ even knowledge of all the processing steps or devices\n   that act on the document\
    \ file. A large part of the difficulty in the\n   past has been due to some assumptions\
    \ we made about the rest of the\n   world being approximately like our own environment.\
    \ We now see that\n   the problems are due to differing assumptions and treatment\
    \ of files\n   to be printed as documents. We therefore propose to define certain\n\
    \   standard formats for files and describe the expected final form for\n   printed\
    \ copies of such files.\n   These standard formats are not additional File Transfer\
    \ Protocol data\n   types/modes/structures, but rather usage descriptions between\
    \ the\n   originator and ultimate receiver of the file. It may be useful or\n\
    \   even necessary at some hosts to construct programs that convert files\n  \
    \ between common local formats and the standard formats specified here.\n   The\
    \ intent is that the author of a document may prepare his/her text\n   and store\
    \ it in an online file, then advertise that file by name and\n   format (as specified\
    \ here), such that interested individuals may copy\n   and print the file with\
    \ full understanding of the characteristics of\n   the format controls and the\
    \ logical page size.\n"
- title: Standardization Elements
  contents:
  - "Standardization Elements\n   The elements or aspects of a file to be standardized\
    \ are the\n   character or code set used, the format control procedures, the area\n\
    \   of the page to be used for text, and the method to describe\n   overstruck\
    \ or underlined characters.\n   The area of the page to be used for text can be\
    \ confusing to discuss,\n   in an attempt to be clear we define a physical page\
    \ and a logical\n   page. Please note that the main emphasis of this note is to\
    \ describe\n   the standard formats in terms of the logical page, and that it\
    \ is up\n   to each site to map the logical page onto the physical page of each\n\
    \   of their devices.\n                                 - 1 -\f              \

    \         The physical page is the medium that carries the text, the\n       \
    \  height and width of its area are measured in inches.\n            The typical\
    \ physical page is a piece of paper eleven inches\n            high and eight\
    \ and one half inches wide.\n               Typical print density is 10 characters\
    \ per inch\n               horizontally and 6 characters per inch vertically.\
    \ This\n               results in the typical physical page having a maximum\n\
    \               capacity of 66 lines and 85 characters per line. It is\n     \
    \          often the case that printing devices limit the area of\n          \
    \     the physical page by enforcing margins.\n      Logical Page\n         The\
    \ logical page is the area that can contain text, the height\n         of this\
    \ area is measured in lines and the width is measured in\n         characters.\n\
    \            A typical logical page is 60 lines high and 72 characters\n     \
    \       wide.\n   Code Set\n      The character encoding will be the network standard\
    \ Network\n      Virtual Terminal (NVT) code as used in Telnet and File Transfer\n\
    \      protocols, that is ASCII in an eight bit byte with the high order\n   \
    \   bit zero.\n   Format Control\n      The format will be controlled by the ASCII\
    \ format effectors:\n         Form Feed       <FF>\n            Moves the printer\
    \ to the top of the next logical page\n            keeping the same horizontal\
    \ position.\n         Carriage Return <CR>\n            Moves the printer to the\
    \ left edge of the logical page\n            remaining on current line.\n    \

    \ position.\n         Horizontal Tab  <HT>\n            Moves the printer to the\
    \ next horizontal tab stop.\n               The conventional stops for horizontal\
    \ tabs are every\n               eight characters, that is character positions\
    \ 9, 17, 25,\n               ... within the logical page.\n            Note that\
    \ it is difficult to enforce these conventions and\n            it is therefore\
    \ recommended that horizontal tabs not be used\n            in document files.\n\
    \         Vertical Tab    <VT>\n            Moves the printer to the next vertical\
    \ tab stop.\n               The conventional stops for vertical tabs are every\
    \ eight\n               lines starting at the first printing line on each logical\n\
    \               page, that is lines 1, 9, 17, ... within the logical\n       \
    \        page.\n            Note that it is difficult to enforce these conventions\
    \ and\n            it is therefore recommended that vertical tabs not be used\n\
    \            in document files.\n         Back Space      <BS>\n            Moves\
    \ the printer one character position toward the left\n            edge of the\

    \ any\n      effectors which are not used in a format standard are ignored.\n\

    \ composite line is made up of text segments each\n            terminated by the\
    \ sequence <CR><NUL> except that the final\n            segment is terminated\
    \ by the sequence <CR><LF>.\n         By Character\n            Each character\
    \ to be overstruck is to be immediately\n            followed by a <BS> and the\
    \ overstrike character.\n   End of Line\n      The end of line convention is the\
    \ Telnet end of line convention\n      which is the sequence <CR><LF>. It is recommended\
