    \ RFC Numbers 1000-1099\nStatus of This Memo\n   This memo is a slightly annotated\
    \ list of the 100 RFCs from RFC 1000\n   through RFCs 1099.  This is a status\
    \ report on these RFCs.  This memo\n   provides information for the Internet community.\
    \  It does not specify\n   an Internet standard.  Distribution of this memo is\
    \ unlimited.\n1099    Reynolds     Dec 91    Requests For Comments Summary\nThis\
    \ memo.\n1098    Case         Apr 89    A Simple Network Management\n        \
    \                       Protocol (SNMP)\nThis RFC is a re-release of RFC 1067,\
    \ with a changed \"Status of this\nMemo\" section.  This memo defines a simple\
    \ protocol by which management\ninformation for a network element may be inspected\
    \ or altered by\nlogically remote users.  In particular, together with its companion\n\
    memos which describe the structure of management information along with\nthe initial\
    \ management information base, these documents provide a\nsimple, workable architecture\
    \ and system for managing TCP/IP-based\ninternets and in particular the Internet.\n\
    1097    Miller       Apr 89    Telnet Subliminal-Message Option\nThis RFC specifies\
    \ a standard for the Internet community.  Hosts on the\nInternet that display\
    \ subliminal messages within the Telnet protocol are\nexpected to adopt and implement\
    \ this standard.\n1096    Marcy        Mar 89    Telnet X Display Location Option\n\
    This RFC specifies a standard for the Internet community.  Hosts on the\nInternet\
    \ that transmit the X display location within the Telnet protocol\nare expected\
    \ to adopt and implement this standard.\n1095    Warrier      Apr 89    The Common\
    \ Management Information\n                               Services and Protocol\
    \ over TCP/IP\n                               (CMOT)\nThis memo defines a network\
    \ management architecture that uses the\nInternational Organization for Standardization's\
    \ (ISO) Common Management\nInformation Services/Common Management Information\
    \ Protocol (CMIS/CMIP)\nin a TCP/IP environment.  This architecture provides a\
    \ means by which\ncontrol and monitoring information can be exchanged between\
    \ a manager\nand a remote network element.  In particular, this memo defines the\n\
    means for implementing the Draft International Standard (DIS) version of\nCMIS/CMIP\
    \ on top of Internet transport protocols for the purpose of\ncarrying management\
    \ information defined in the Internet-standard\nmanagement information base. \
    \ DIS CMIS/CMIP is suitable for deployment\nin TCP/IP networks while CMIS/CMIP\
    \ moves toward becoming an\nInternational Standard.  Together with the relevant\
    \ ISO standards and\nthe companion RFCs that describe the initial structure of\
    \ management\ninformation and management information base, these documents provide\
    \ the\nbasis for a comprehensive architecture and system for managing TCP/IP-\n\
    based internets, and in particular the Internet.\n1094    Sun          Mar 89\
    \    NFS: Network File System\n                               Protocol Specification\n\
    This RFC describes a protocol that Sun Microsystems, Inc., and others\nare using.\
    \  A new version of the protocol is under development, but\nothers may benefit\
    \ from the descriptions of the current protocol, and\ndiscussion of some of the\
    \ design issues.\n1093    Braun        Feb 89    The NSFNET Routing Architecture\n\
    This document describes the routing architecture for the NSFNET centered\naround\
    \ the new NSFNET Backbone, with specific emphasis on the interface\nbetween the\
    \ backbone and its attached networks.\n1092    Rekhter      Feb 89    EGP and\
    \ Policy Based Routing\n                               in the New NSFNET Backbone\n\
    This memo discusses implementation decisions for routing issues in the\nNSFNET,\
    \ especially in the NSFNET Backbone.  Of special concern is the\nrestriction of\
    \ routing information to advertize the best route as\nestablished by a policy\
    \ decision.\n1091    VanBokkelen  Feb 89    Telnet Terminal-Type Option\nThis\
    \ RFC specifies a standard for the Internet community.  Hosts on the\nInternet\
    \ that exchange terminal type information within the Telnet\nprotocol are expected\
    \ to adopt and implement this standard.\nThis standard supersedes RFC 930.  A\
    \ change is made to permit cycling\nthrough a list of possible terminal types\
    \ and selecting the most\nappropriate\n1090    Ullmann      Feb 89    SMTP on\
    \ X.25\nThis memo proposes a standard for SMTP on the virtual circuit facility\n\
    provided by the X.25 standard of the CCITT.\n1089    Schoffstall  Feb 89    SNMP\
    \ over Ethernet\nThis memo describes an experimental method by which the Simple\
    \ Network\nManagement Protocol (SNMP) can be used over Ethernet MAC layer framing\n\
    instead of the Internet UDP/IP protocol stack.  This specification is\nuseful\
    \ for LAN based network elements that support no higher layer\nprotocols beyond\
    \ the MAC sub-layer.\n1088    McLaughlin   Feb 89    A Standard for the Transmission\
    \ of IP\n                               Datagrams over NetBIOS Networks\nThis\
    \ document specifies a standard method of encapsulating the Internet\nProtocol\
    \ (IP) datagrams on NetBIOS networks.\n1087    IAB          Jan 89    Ethics and\
    \ the Internet\nThis memo is a statement of policy by the Internet Activities\
    \ Board\n(IAB) concerning the proper use of the resources of the Internet.\n1086\
    \    Onions       Dec 88    ISO-TP0 bridge between TCP and X.25\nThis memo proposes\
    \ a standard for the Internet community.  Hosts on the\nInternet that choose to\
    \ implement ISO TP0 transport connectivity between\nTCP and X.25 based hosts are\
    \ expected to experiment with this proposal.\nTCP port 146 is reserved for this\
    \ proposal.\n1085    Rose         Dec 88    ISO Presentation Services\n      \
    \                         on top of TCP/IP-based internets\nRFC 1006 describes\
    \ a mechanism for providing the ISO transport service\non top of TCP/IP.  Once\
    \ this method is applied, one may implement \"real\"\nISO applications on top\
    \ of TCP/IP-based internets, by simply\nimplementing OSI session, presentation,\
    \ and application services on top\nof the transport service access point which\
    \ is provided on top of the\nTCP.  Although straight-forward, there are some environments\
    \ in which\nthe richness provided by the OSI application layer is desired, but\
    \ it is\nnonetheless impractical to implement the underlying OSI infrastructure\n\
    (i.e., the presentation, session, and transport services on top of the\nTCP).\n\
    This memo describes an approach for providing \"stream-lined\" support of\nOSI\
    \ application services on top of TCP/IP-based internets for such\nconstrained\
    \ environments.  This memo proposes a standard for the\nInternet community.\n\
    1084    Reynolds     Dec 88      BOOTP Vendor Information Extensions\nThis RFC\
    \ is a slight revision and extension of RFC-1048 by Philip\nPrindeville.  This\
    \ memo will be updated as additional tags are are\ndefined.  This edition introduces\
    \ Tag 13 for Boot File Size.  Comments\nand suggestions for improvements are sought.\n\
    1083    IAB          Dec 88      IAB Official Protocol Standards\nThis memo describes\
    \ the state of standardization of protocols used in\nthe Internet as determined\
    \ by the Internet Activities Board (IAB).  An\noverview of the standards procedures\
    \ is presented first, followed by\ndiscussions of the standardization process\
    \ and the RFC document series,\nthen the explanation of the terms is presented,\
    \ the lists of protocols\nin each stage of standardization follows, and finally\
    \ pointers to\nreferences and contacts for further information.\nThis memo is\
    \ issued quarterly, please be sure the copy you are reading\nis dated within the\
    \ last three months.\n1082    Rose         Nov 88      Post Office Protocol -\
    \ Version 3\n                                 Extended Service Offerings\nThis\
    \ memo suggests a simple method for workstations to dynamically\naccess mail from\
    \ a discussion group server, as an extension to an\nearlier memo which dealt with\
    \ dynamically accessing mail from a mailbox\nserver using the Post Office Protocol\
    \ - Version 3 (POP3).  This RFC\nspecifies a proposed protocol for the Internet\
    \ community, and requests\ndiscussion and suggestions for improvements.  All of\
    \ the extensions\ndescribed in this memo to the POP3 are OPTIONAL.\n1081    Rose\
    \         Nov 88      Post Office Protocol - Version 3\nThis memo suggests a simple\
    \ method for workstations to dynamically\naccess mail from a mailbox server. \

    \ the Telnet protocol are\nexpected to adopt and implement this standard.\n1079\
    \    Hedrick      Dec 88      Telnet Terminal Speed Option\nThis RFC specifies\
    \ a standard for the Internet community.  Hosts on the\nInternet that exchange\
    \ terminal speed information within the Telnet\nprotocol are expected to adopt\
    \ and implement this standard.\n1078    Lottor       Nov 88      TCP Port Service\
    \ Multiplexer (TCPMUX)\nThis RFC proposes an Internet standard which can be used\
    \ by future TCP\nservices instead of using 'well-known ports'.\n1077    Leiner\

    \           Networking\nThis memo presents the results of a working group on High\
    \ Bandwidth\nNetworking.  This RFC is for your information and you are encouraged\
    \ to\ncomment on the issues presented.\n1076    Trewitt      Nov 88      HEMS\
    \ Monitoring and Control Language\nThis RFC specifies a query language for monitoring\
    \ and control of\nnetwork entities.  This RFC supercedes RFC 1023, extending the\
    \ query\nlanguage and providing more discussion of the underlying issues.\nThis\
    \ language is a component of the High-Level Entity Monitoring System\n(HEMS) described\
    \ in RFC 1021 and RFC 1022.  Readers may wish to consult\nthese RFCs when reading\
    \ this memo.  RFC 1024 contains detailed\nassignments of numbers and structures\
    \ used in this system.  Portions of\nRFC 1024 that define query language structures\
    \ are superceded by\ndefinitions in this memo.  This memo assumes a knowledge\
    \ of the ISO data\nencoding standard, ASN.1.\n1075    Waitzman     Nov 88    \
    \  Distance Vector Multicast Routing\n                                 Protocol\n\
    This RFC describes a distance-vector-style routing protocol for routing\nmulticast\
    \ datagrams through an internet.  It is derived from the Routing\nInformation\
    \ Protocol (RIP), and implements multicasting as described in\nRFC-1054.  This\
    \ is an experimental protocol, and its implementation is\nnot recommended at this\
    \ time.\n1074    Rekhter      Oct 88      The NSFNET Backbone SPF based Interior\n\

    \ convey\nwindow size to a Telnet server.\n1072    Jacobson     Oct 88      TCP\
    \ Extensions for Long-Delay Paths\nThis RFC proposes a set of extensions to the\
    \ TCP protocol to provide\nefficient operation over a path with a high bandwidth*delay\
    \ product.\nThese extensions are not proposed as an Internet standard at this\
    \ time.\nInstead, they are intended as a basis for further experimentation and\n\
    research on transport protocol performance.\n1071    Braden       Aug 88     \
    \ Computing the Internet Checksum\nThis RFC summarizes techniques and algorithms\
    \ for efficiently computing\nthe Internet checksum.  It is not a standard, but\
    \ a set of useful\nimplementation techniques.\n1070    Hagens       Feb 89   \
    \   Use of the Internet as a Subnetwork\n                                 for\
    \ Experimentation with the OSI\n                                 Network Layer\n\
    This RFC proposes a scenario for experimentation with the International\nOrganization\
    \ for Standardization (ISO) Open Systems Interconnection\n(OSI) network layer\
    \ protocols over the Internet and requests discussion\nand suggestions for improvements\
    \ to this scenario.  This RFC also\nproposes the creation of an experimental OSI\
    \ internet.  To participate\nin the experimental OSI internet, a system must abide\
    \ by the agreements\nset forth in this RFC.\n1069    Callon       Feb 89     \
    \ Guidelines for the use of Internet-IP\n                                 addresses\
    \ in the ISO Connectionless-\n                                 Mode Network Protocol\n\
    This RFC suggests an addressing scheme for use with the ISO\nConnectionless Network\
    \ Protocol (CLNP) in the Internet.  This is a\nsolution to one of the problems\
    \ inherent in the use of \"ISO-grams\" in\nthe Internet.  This memo is a revision\
    \ of RFC 986.  This RFC suggests a\nproposed protocol for the Internet community,\
    \ and requests discussion\nand suggestions for improvements.\n1068    DeSchon\

    \         (BFTP)\nThis RFC describes an Internet background file transfer service\
    \ that is\nbuilt upon the third-party transfer model of FTP.  No new protocols\
    \ are\ninvolved.  The purpose of this memo is to stimulate discussions on new\n\
    Internet service modes.\n1067    Case         Aug 88      A Simple Network Management\
    \ Protocol\nThis RFC defines a simple protocol by which management information\
    \ for a\nnetwork element may be inspected or altered by logically remote users.\n\
    In particular, together with its companion memos which describe the\nstructure\
    \ of management information along with the initial management\ninformation base,\
    \ these documents provide a simple, workable\narchitecture and system for managing\
    \ TCP/IP-based internets and in\nparticular, the Internet.\nThis memo specifies\
    \ a draft standard for the Internet community. TCP/IP\nimplementations in the\
    \ Internet which are network manageable are\nexpected to adopt and implement this\
    \ specification.\n1066    McCloghrie    Aug 88      Management Information Base\
    \ for Network\n                                  Management of TCP/IP-based internets\n\
    This RFC provides the initial version of the Management Information Base\n(MIB)\
    \ for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based\ninternets in the\
    \ short-term.  In particular, together with its companion\nmemos which describe\
    \ the structure of management information along with\nthe initial network management\
    \ protocol, these documents provide a\nsimple, workable architecture and system\
    \ for managing TCP/IP-based\ninternets, and in particular, the Internet.\nThis\
    \ memo specifies a draft standard for the Internet community.  TCP/IP\nimplementations\
    \ in the Internet which are network manageable are\nexpected to adopt and implement\
    \ this specification.\n1065    Rose          Aug 88      Structure and Identification\

    \ (Version 1)\n                                  Specification and Implementation\n\
    This memo describes the Network Time Protocol (NTP), specifies its\nformal structure\
    \ and summarizes information useful for its\nimplementation.  NTP provides the\
    \ mechanisms to synchronize time and\ncoordinate time distribution in a large,\
    \ diverse internet operating at\nrates from mundane to lightwave.  It uses a returnable-time\
    \ design in\nwhich a distributed subnet of time servers operating in a self-\n\
    organizing, hierarchical master-slave configuration synchronizes logical\nclocks\
    \ within the subnet and to national time standards via wire or\nradio.  The servers\
    \ can also redistribute reference time via local\nrouting algorithms and time\
    \ daemons.\nThe NTP architectures, algorithms and protocols which have evolved\
    \ over\nseveral years of implementation and refinement are described in this\n\
    document.  The prototype system, which has been in regular operation in\nthe Internet\
    \ for the last two years, is described in an Appendix along\nwith performance\
    \ data which shows that timekeeping accuracy throughout\nmost portions of the\
    \ Internet can be ordinarily maintained to within a\nfew tens of milliseconds,\
    \ even the cases of failure or disruption of\nclocks, time servers or nets. This\
    \ is a Draft Standard for an Elective\nprotocol.\n1058    Hedrick       Jun 88\
    \      Routing Information Protocol\nThis RFC describes an existing protocol for\
    \ exchanging routing\ninformation among gateways and other hosts.  It is intended\
    \ to be used\nas a basis for developing gateway software for use in the Internet\n\
    community.\n1057    Sun           Jun 88       RPC: Remote Procedure Call Protocol\n\
    \                                   Specification Version 2\nThis RFC describes\
    \ a standard that Sun Microsystems and others are\nusing, and is one we wish to\
    \ propose for the Internet's consideration.\nThis memo is not an Internet standard\
    \ at this time.\n1056    Lambert       Jun 88   PCMAIL: A Distributed Mail System\n\
    \                               for Personal Computers\nThis memo is a discussion\
    \ of the Pcmail workstation based distributed\nmail system.  It is identical to\
    \ the discussion in RFC-993, save that a\nnew, much simpler mail transport protocol\
    \ is described.  The new\ntransport protocol is the result of continued research\
    \ into ease of\nprotocol implementation and use issues.\n1055    Romkey      \
    \   Jun 88    A Nonstandard for Transmission of\n                            \
    \     IP Datagrams over Serial Lines: SLIP\nThe TCP/IP protocol family runs over\
    \ a variety of network media: IEEE\n802.3 (ethernet) and 802.5 (token ring) LAN's,\
    \ X.25 lines, satellite\nlinks, and serial lines.  There are standard encapsulations\
    \ for IP\npackets defined for many of these networks, but there is no standard\
    \ for\nserial lines.  SLIP, Serial Line IP, is a currently a de facto standard,\n\
    commonly used for point-to-point serial connections running TCP/IP.  It\nis not\
    \ an Internet standard.\n1054    Deering        May 88      Host Extensions for\
    \ IP Multicasting\nThis memo specifies the extensions required of a host implementation\
    \ of\nthe Internet Protocol (IP) to support multicasting.  IP multicasting is\n\
    the transmission of an IP datagram to a \"host group\", a set hosts\nidentified\
    \ by a single IP destination address.  A multicast datagram is\ndelivered to all\
    \ members of its destination host group with the same\n\"best-efforts\" reliability\
    \ as regular unicast IP datagrams.  It is\nproposed as a standard for IP multicasting\
    \ in the Internet.  This\nspecification is a major revision of RFC-988.\n1053\
    \    Levy           Apr 88       Telnet X.3 PAD Option\nThis RFC proposes a new\
    \ option to Telnet for the Internet community, and\nrequests discussion and suggestions\

    \                                 Management Standards\nThis RFC is intended to\
    \ convey to the Internet community and other\ninterested parties the recommendations\
    \ of the Internet Activities Board\n(IAB) for the development of network management\
    \ protocols for use in the\nTCP/IP environment.  This memo does NOT, in and of\
    \ itself, define or\npropose an Official Internet Protocol.  It does reflect,\
    \ however, the\npolicy of the IAB with respect to further network management development\n\
    in the short and long term.\n1051    Prindeville     Mar 88     A Standard for\

    \ Packets over ARCNET\n                                   Networks\nThis memo\
    \ specifies a standard method of encapsulating Internet Protocol\n(IP) and Address\
    \ Resolution Protocol (ARP) datagrams on an ARCNET.  This\nRFC is a standard protocol\
    \ for the Internet community.\n1050    Sun             Apr 88      RPC: Remote\

    \                                   Authentication Scheme\nThe purpose of this\
    \ RFC is to focus discussion on authentication\nproblems in the Internet and possible\
    \ methods of solution.  The proposed\nsolutions this document are not intended\
    \ as standards for the Internet\nat this time.  Rather, it is hoped that a general\
    \ consensus will emerge\nas to the appropriate solution to authentication problems,\
    \ leading\neventually to the adoption of standards.  This document suggests\n\
    mediated access-control and authentication procedures suitable for those\ncases\
    \ when an association is to be set up between users belonging to\ndifferent trust\
    \ environments.\n1003     Katz           Mar 87     Issues in Defining an Equations\n\
