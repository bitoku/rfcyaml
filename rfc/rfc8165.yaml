- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   To minimize the risks associated with pervasive surveillance,\
    \ it is\n   necessary for the Internet technical community to address the\n  \
    \ vulnerabilities exploited in the attacks documented in [RFC7258] and\n   the\
    \ threats described in [RFC7624].  The goal of this document is to\n   address\
    \ a common design pattern that emerges from the increase in\n   encryption: explicit\
    \ association of metadata that would previously\n   have been inferred from the\
    \ plaintext protocol.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   This document makes extensive use of standard security and\
    \ privacy\n   terminology; see [RFC4949] and [RFC6973].  Readers should be familiar\n\
    \   with the terms defined in [RFC6973], including \"Eavesdropper\",\n   \"Observer\"\
    , \"Initiator\", \"Intermediary\", \"Recipient\", \"Attack\" (in a\n   privacy\
    \ context), \"Correlation\", \"Fingerprint\", \"Traffic Analysis\",\n   and \"\
    Identifiability\" (and related terms).  Readers should also be\n   familiar with\
    \ terms that are specific to the attacks discussed in\n   [RFC7624], including\
    \ \"Pervasive Attack\", \"Passive Pervasive Attack\",\n   \"Active Pervasive Attack\"\
    , \"Observation\", \"Inference\", and\n   \"Collaborator\".\n"
- title: 3.  Design Pattern
  contents:
  - "3.  Design Pattern\n   One of the core mitigations for the loss of confidentiality\
    \ in the\n   presence of pervasive surveillance is data minimization, which limits\n\
    \   the amount of data disclosed to those elements absolutely required to\n  \
    \ complete the relevant protocol exchange.  When data minimization is\n   in effect,\
    \ some information that was previously available may be\n   removed from specific\
    \ protocol exchanges.  The information may be\n   removed explicitly (for example,\
    \ by a browser suppressing cookies\n   during private modes) or by other means.\
    \  As noted in [RFC7624], some\n   topologies that aggregate or alter the network\
    \ path also act to\n   reduce the ease with which metadata is available to eavesdroppers.\n\
    \   In some cases, other actors within a protocol context will continue\n   to\
    \ have access to the information that has been thus withdrawn from\n   specific\
    \ protocol exchanges.  If those actors attach the information\n   as metadata\
    \ to those protocol exchanges, the confidentiality effect\n   of data minimization\
    \ is lost.\n   Restoring information is particularly tempting at systems not\n\
    \   primarily deployed to increase confidentiality.  A proxy providing\n   compression,\
    \ for example, may wish to restore the identity of the\n   requesting party; similarly,\
    \ a VPN system used to provide channel\n   security may believe that the origin\
    \ IP should be restored.  Actors\n   considering restoring metadata may believe\
    \ that they understand the\n   relevant privacy considerations or believe that,\
    \ because the primary\n   purpose of the service was not privacy-related, none\
    \ exist.  Examples\n   of this design pattern include [RFC7239] and [RFC7871].\n"
- title: 4.  Advice
  contents:
  - "4.  Advice\n   Avoid inserting metadata to restore information that would otherwise\n\
    \   be unavailable to later participants in a protocol exchange.  It\n   contributes\
    \ to the overall loss of confidentiality for the Internet\n   and trust in the\
    \ Internet as a medium.  Do not add metadata to flows\n   at intermediary devices\
    \ unless a positive affirmation of approval for\n   restoration has been received\
    \ from the actor whose data will be\n   added.\n   Instead, design the protocol\
    \ so that the actor can add such metadata\n   themselves so that it flows end\
    \ to end, rather than requiring the\n   action of other parties.  In addition\
    \ to improving privacy, this\n   approach ensures consistent availability between\
    \ the communicating\n   parties, no matter what path is taken.  (Note that this\
    \ document does\n   not attempt to describe how an actor sets policies on providing\
    \ this\n   metadata, as the range of systems that might be implied is very\n \
    \  broad).\n   As an example, RFC 7871 describes a method that had already been\n\
    \   deployed and notes that it is unlikely that a clean-slate design\n   would\
    \ result in this mechanism.  If a clean-slate design were built\n   to follow\
    \ the advice in this document, that design would likely not\n   use a core element\
    \ of RFC 7871: rather than adding metadata at a\n   proxy, it would provide facilities\
    \ for end systems to add it to their\n   initial queries.  In the case of RFC\
    \ 7871, the relevant metadata is\n   relatively easy for an end system to derive,\
    \ as Session Traversal\n   Utilities for NAT (STUN) [RFC5389] provides a method\
    \ for learning the\n   reflexive transport address from which a client subnet\
    \ could be\n   derived.  This would allow clients to populate this data themselves,\n\
    \   thus affirming their consent and providing data at a granularity with\n  \
    \ which they were comfortable.  As in RFC 7871, the addition of this\n   data\
    \ would require confirmation that the upstream DNS resolver\n   understands what\
    \ to do with it, but the same negotiation mechanism,\n   an Extension Mechanisms\
    \ for DNS (EDNS(0)) option [RFC6891], could be\n   used.  Because of this negotiation,\
    \ there would be a new variability\n   in responses that would change the caching\
    \ behavior for data supplied\n   by participating servers.  This is not a major\
    \ change from the\n   current design, however, as the same considerations set\
    \ out in\n   Sections 7.3.2 and 7.5 of RFC 7871 would apply to client-supplied\n\
    \   subnets as well as to proxy-supplied subnets.\n   From a protocol perspective,\
    \ in other words, this approach would be a\n   minor change from RFC 7871, would\
    \ be as fully featured, and would\n   provide better privacy properties than the\
    \ on-path update mechanism\n   RFC 7871 provides.  The next section examines why,\
    \ despite this,\n   deployment considerations have sometimes trumped cleaner designs.\n"
- title: 5.  Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Deployment Considerations\n   There are a few common tensions associated\
    \ with the deployment of\n   systems that restore metadata.  The first is the\
    \ trade-off in speed\n   of deployment for different actors.  The Forwarded HTTP\
    \ Extension in\n   [RFC7239] provides an example of this.  When used with a proxy,\
    \ it\n   restores information related to the original requesting party, thus\n\
    \   allowing a responding server to tailor responses according to the\n   original\
    \ party's region, network, or other characteristics associated\n   with the identity.\
    \  It would, of course, be possible for the\n   originating client to add this\
    \ data itself, after using STUN\n   [RFC5389] or a similar mechanism to first\
    \ determine the information\n   to declare.  This would require, however, full\
    \ specification and\n   adoption of this mechanism by the end systems.  It would\
    \ not be\n   available at all during this period and would thereafter be limited\n\
    \   to systems that have been upgraded to include it.  The long tail of\n   browser\
    \ deployments indicates that many systems might go without\n   upgrades for a\
    \ significant period of time.  The proxy infrastructure,\n   in contrast, is commonly\
    \ under more active management and represents\n   a much smaller number of elements;\
    \ this impacts both the general\n   deployment difficulty and the number of systems\
    \ that the origin\n   server must trust.\n   The second common tension is between\
    \ metadata minimization and the\n   desire to tailor content responses.  For origin\
    \ servers whose content\n   is common across users, the loss of metadata may have\
    \ limited impact\n   on the system's functioning.  For other systems, which commonly\n\
    \   tailor content by region or network, the loss of metadata may imply a\n  \
    \ loss of functionality.  Where the user desires this functionality,\n   restoration\
    \ can commonly be achieved by the use of other identifiers\n   or login procedures.\
    \  Where the user does not desire this\n   functionality, but it is a preference\
    \ of the server or a third party,\n   adjustment is more difficult.  At the extreme,\
    \ content blocking by\n   network origin may be a regulatory requirement.  Trusting\
    \ a network\n   intermediary to provide accurate data is, of course, fragile in\
    \ this\n   case, but it may be a part of the regulatory framework.\n   There are\
    \ also tensions with latency of operation.  For example,\n   where the end system\
    \ does not initially know the information that\n   would be added by on-path devices,\
    \ it must engage the protocol\n   mechanisms to determine it.  Determining a public\
    \ IP address to\n   include in a locally supplied header might require a STUN\
    \ exchange,\n   and the additional latency of this exchange discourages deployment\
    \ of\n   host-based solutions.  To minimize this latency, engaging those\n   mechanisms\
    \ may need to be done in parallel with or in advance of the\n   core protocol\
    \ exchanges with which this metadata would be supplied.\n   These tensions do\
    \ not change the basic recommendation, but they\n   suggest that the parties who\
    \ are introducing encryption and data\n   minimization for existing protocols\
    \ consider carefully whether the\n   work also implies introducing mechanisms\
    \ for the end-to-end\n   provisioning of metadata when a user has actively consented\
    \ to\n   provide it.\n"

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This memorandum describes a design pattern emerging\
    \ from responses to\n   the attacks described in [RFC7258].  Continued use of\
    \ this design\n   pattern, which uses mid-flow devices to restore metadata, lowers\
    \ the\n   impact of mitigations to that attack.\n   Note that some emergency service\
    \ recipients, notably PSAPs (Public\n   Safety Answering Points) may prefer data\
    \ provided by a network to\n   data provided by an end system, because an end\
    \ system could use false\n   data to attack others or consume resources.  While\
    \ this has the\n   consequence that the data available to the PSAP is often more\
    \ coarse\n   than that available to the end system, the risk of false data being\n\
    \   provided involves a risk to the lives of those targeted.\n"
