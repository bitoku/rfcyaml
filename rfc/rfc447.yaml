  - "             IMP/TIP Memory Retrofit Schedule (Revision 1)\nThis revision contains\
    \ two major changes to RFC #434.  First, all\nretrofits scheduled prior to February\
    \ first have been completed and are\ntherefore removed from the schedule.  Second,\
    \ the CCA retrofit has been\nrescheduled from 3/20 to 2/28.\nThe revised text\
    \ of RFC # 434 follows:\nDuring the first several month of 1973 we will be retrofitting\
    \ each IMP\nand TIP with additional core memory.  At the end of the retrofit\n\
    program, the memory sizes of the various machines will be as follows:\n   IMP\
    \ (516 or 316) - 16K words\n   TIP - 28K words\n   TIP with Magnetic Tape Option\
    \ - 32K words\nIn addition, the expansion of the TIP core memory will necessitate\n\
    enlarging the TIP to two cabinets.\nListed below is the schedule for the remaining\
    \ retrofits.  We have\narranged this schedule to coincide with usual monthly Preventive\n\
    Maintenance at each site so as to minimize user inconvenience, but the\nwork required\
    \ will frequently require the machines to be down longer\nthan normal.  I will\
    \ issue additional RFC's updating this schedule as\nnecessary.\nAny site which\
    \ anticipates difficulty with the expansion of TIP size,\nand thus the floor space\
    \ requirement, should contact Hawley Rising (BBN)\nat\n   (617) 491-1850 ext.\
