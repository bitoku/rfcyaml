Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
In particular, it defines objects for managing the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) within the interface attributes defined in the Integrated Services Model.
Thus, the Integrated Services MIB is directly relevant to and cross referenced by this MIB.
Comments should be made to the RSVP Working Group, rsvp@isi.edu.
The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
Network Management Framework consists of four major components.
STD 17, RFC 1213 defines MIB II, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
RFC 1445 which defines the administrative and other architectural aspects of the framework.
RFC 1448 which defines the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Object Definitions Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.
Several new data types are introduced as a textual convention in this MIB document.
These textual conventions enhance the readability of the specification and can ease comparison with other specifications if appropriate.
It should be noted that the introduction of the these textual conventions has no effect on either the syntax nor the semantics of any managed objects.
The use of these is merely an artifact of the explanatory method used.
Objects defined in terms of one of these methods are always encoded by means of the rules that define the primitive type.
Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are adopted merely for the convenience of readers and writers in pursuit of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.
The MIB is composed of the following sections: General Objects Session Statistics Table Session Sender Table Reservation Requests Received Table Reservation Requests Forwarded Table RSVP Interface Attributes Table RSVP Neighbor Table
As a general rule, it is difficult in SNMP to describe arbitrarily long of complex messages; this MIB therefore seeks to describe the Path State Database and the Reservation State Database as though each flow and filter description received in an aggregate message had been received in a separate reservation message.
Thus, if a RESV message is received for session 224.1.2.3 UDP 4455 with two filter/flow spec groups describing a sender 1.2.3.4 and another sender 1.2.7.8, these two will show in the MIB as two separate rows: one for 224.1.2.3
UDP 4455 from 1.2.3.4 and the other for 224.1.2.3
UDP 4455 from 1.2.7.8. 2.3.
the Path and Reservation State Databases
The path and reservation state tables are writeable.
Writing into the Path and Reservation State databases allows one to perform RSVP reservations without authenticating through RSVP mechanisms, but rather through SNMP mechanisms.
State created in this way by SNMP does not time out and cannot be deleted by receiving an RSVP teardown message; it can only be deleted by SNMP.
Deletion is accomplished by writing 'destroy' to the associated Row Status object, and this will initiate a teardown message as if the state had timed out.
Intended use of Flow Notifications 2.4.1.
The Lost Flow notification is an asychronous event that signifies that a flow is no longer being observed.
The newFlow Notification defined in this MIB can be used to advise a network management system of the state of a flow.

"These objects are required for RSVP Systems."
This notification is required for Systems sup  porting  the  RSVP  Policy Module using an SNMP interface to the Policy Manager."
The use of an SNMP SET results in an RSVP or Integrated Services reservation under rules that are different compared to if the reservation was negotiated using RSVP.
However, no other security considerations exist other than those imposed by SNMP itself.
