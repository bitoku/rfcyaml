  - "                 Response to RFC #116 (May NWG Meeting)\nPhase One\nSoftware\
    \ Status of 360/65\n     1) Our software is currently being changed to reflect\
    \ the new NCP\nprotocol delineated in RFC #107.  These changes will be completed\n\
    before the end of May.\n     2) We are implementing a logger that, after an automatic\
    \ ICP\ndialog, can be driven from a local console.  Any desirable messages\ncan\
    \ be sent or received in EBCDIC, ASCII (8), or as binary streams.\nThe purpose\
    \ of the logger is to allow sites to checkout remote log in\nprocedures.  Since\
    \ no production-oriented services will be offered on\nthe 360/65, the logger is\
    \ for experimental purposes only.  It will be\ncompleted before the end of May.\n\
    \     3) We have not planned a TELNET. We will, however, implement both\nserver\
    \ and user TELNETs once a specification is generally accepted.\nImplementation\
    \ time will be on the order of two weeks.\nTransition from 360/65 to PDP-10\n\
    \     1) We plan to move from our 360/65 to a PDP-10.  Rand will offer\nNetwork\
    \ services on the PDP-10.  The hardware and software status of\nthe PDP-10 will\
    \ be reported later.\n     2) The 360/65 Network connection will remain for some\
    \ time due to\nits production use by another ARPA-sponsored project at Rand.\n\
    Maintenance of the 360/65 Network software will be provided for the\nlifetime\
    \ of the connection but no new programs will be developed on\nthe 360/65 after\
    \ September.\n     1) The UCSB/Rand Network activities were recently reported\
    \ in RFC\n#113 and earlier in RFC #78.  The Climate Dynamics Project (CDP) at\n\
    Rand will continue to use this facility (more heavily) in the future.\n     2)\
    \ In conjunction with the above facility, the Rand Network team\nhas planned and\
    \ implemented a front-end graphics program to allow the\nreduced data from UCSB\
    \ to be displayed and interacted with locally as\ngraphs, contours, plots, and\
    \ lists.  This will be used in about three\nmonths after an intermediate program,\
    \ being written by the CDP\npersonnel, is completed.\nPhase Two\nExperimental\
    \ Data Reconfiguration Service (Form Machine)\n     1) A working session was held\
    \ recently at Rand on the Data\nreconfiguration Service (DRS), the results of\
    \ which have been drafted\nand are being edited by the participants.  These data\
    \ will be\npublished soon as an RFC.  Eric Harslem will be prepared to make an\n\
    oral report at the NWG meeting on the DRS.\nProtocol Manager\n     1) We plan\
    \ to submit a positional paper on a proposed Protocol\nManager, which will allow\
    \ flexibility in both experimental and\nproduction use of connection protocols.\
    \  This will be presented as a\nRequest for Comments on a software package that\
    \ Rand intends to\nimplement for its use on the PDP-10.  For example, it should\
    \ obviate a\nfixed logger on our forthcoming PDP-10.\nComments on Goals and Organization\
    \ of the NWG\n     1) We have been proponents of the collective NWG as a forum\
    \ to\nraise issues and as a general information transfer mechanism of what\nsites\
    \ are doing and thinking.  More recently small working groups and\ncommittees\
    \ have been formed to generate particular specifications such\nas TELNET, the\
    \ new NCP protocol, etc.  We favor continuance of these\nmethods as long as any\
    \ site with a willingness, an interest, and\ncontribution is not excluded from\
    \ any group or committee.  We feel\nthat these groups will limit themselves to\
    \ a small functional size a\npriori because they are directed toward special interests.\n\
    \     The long lead time between the formation of such a group and\ntheir final\
    \ output (and subsequent implementation of the plan) has\nbeen accepted by the\
    \ NWG Technical Chairman and is rather\ndisconcerting.  The NCP glitch cleaning\
    \ committee is an example of\nexpedient work. UTAH, for example, has already implemented\
    \ the new NCP\nprotocol.  Other groups (including the DRS) have not been as\n\
    responsive.  Perhaps the technical problems addressed by other groups\nare more\
    \ complex and the needs for their solutions are not as\nimmediate as the NCP glitches.\
    \  We offer no nice solution except that\nperhaps some guidelines should be established\
    \ concerning timely\npublication of reports.\n     2) Regarding long range goals\
    \ of the NWG, we do not think that\nthe NWG is the right body to establish the\
    \ long range goals.  By long\nrange goals of the NWG, we are really concerned\
    \ (in part) with long\nrange goals of the Network.  We feel that the Principal\
    \ Investigators\nare in a position to have a better perspective of long range\
    \ Network\ngoals than the NWG members.  As a suggestion, one way of converting\n\
    their views into NWG tasks is to have the NWG Technical Chairman host\na one day\
    \ opinion session of the Principal Investigators, then report\nthese views to\
    \ the NWG for the generation of their implied tasks.\n       [ This RFC was put\
    \ into machine readable form for entry ]\n         [ into the online RFC archives\
