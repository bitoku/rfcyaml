  - "1.1.  Overview\n   The framework for Layer 1 VPNs is described in [RFC4847].\
    \  Basic mode\n   operation is further defined in [RFC5251].  The L1VPN Basic\
    \ Mode\n   (L1VPN-BM) document [RFC5251] identifies the information that is\n\
    \   necessary to map customer information (ports identifiers) to provider\n  \
    \ information (identifiers).  It also states that this mapping\n   information\
    \ may be provided via provisioning or via an auto-discovery\n   mechanism.  This\
    \ document provides such an auto-discovery mechanism\n   using Open Shortest Path\
    \ First (OSPF) version 2.  Use of OSPF version\n   3 and support for IPv6 are\
    \ out of scope of this document and will be\n   defined separately.\n   Figure\
    \ 1 shows the L1VPN basic service being supported using OSPF-\n   based L1VPN\
    \ auto-discovery.  This figure shows two PE routers\n   interconnected over a\
    \ GMPLS backbone.  Each PE is attached to three\n   CE devices belonging to three\
    \ different L1VPN connections.  In this\n   network, OSPF is used to provide the\
    \ VPN membership, port mapping,\n   and related information required to support\
    \ basic mode operation.\n                  PE                        PE\n    \

- title: 3.  L1VPN LSA Advertising and Processing
  contents:
  - "3.  L1VPN LSA Advertising and Processing\n   PEs advertise local <CPI, PPI> tuples\
    \ in L1VPN LSAs containing L1VPN\n   Info TLVs.  Each PE MUST originate a separate\
    \ L1VPN LSA with AS\n   flooding scope for each local CE-to-PE link.  The LSA\
    \ MUST be\n   originated each time a PE restarts and every time there is a change\n\
    \   in the PIT entry associated with a local CE-to-PE link.  The LSA MUST\n  \
    \ include a single L1VPN Info TLV and MAY include a single TE Link TLV\n   as\
    \ per [RFC3630] and [RFC4203].  The TE Link TLV carries TE\n   attributes of the\
    \ associated CE-to-PE link.  Note that because CEs\n   are outside of the provider\
    \ TE domain, the attributes of CE-to-PE\n   links are not advertised via normal\
    \ OSPF-TE procedures as described\n   in [RFC3630] and [RFC4203].  If more than\
    \ one L1VPN Info TLVs and/or\n   TE Link TLVs are found in the LSA, the subsequent\
    \ TLVs SHOULD be\n   ignored by the receiving PEs.\n   L1VPN LSAs are of AS-scope\
    \ (LS type is set to 11) and therefore are\n   flooded to all PEs within the AS\
    \ according to [RFC5250].  Every time\n   a PE receives a new, removed, or modified\
    \ L1VPN LSA, the PE MUST\n   check whether it maintains a PIT associated with\
    \ the L1VPN specified\n   in the L1VPN globally unique identifier field.  If this\
    \ is the case\n   (the appropriate PIT will be found if one or more local CE-to-PE\n\
    \   links that belong to the L1VPN are configured), the PE SHOULD add,\n   remove,\
    \ or modify the PIT entry associated with each of the\n   advertised CE-to-PE\
    \ links accordingly.  (An implementation MAY choose\n   to not remove or modify\
    \ the PIT according to local policy or\n   management directives.)  Thus, in the\
    \ normal steady-state case, all\n   PEs associated with a particular L1VPN will\
    \ have identical local PITs\n   for an L1VPN.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Discussion and Example
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Discussion and Example\n   The L1VPN auto-discovery mechanism described\
    \ in this document does\n   not prevent a PE from applying any local policy with\
    \ respect to PIT\n   management.  An example of such a local policy would be the\
    \ ability\n   to configure permanent (static) PIT entries.  Another example would\n\
    \   be the ability to ignore information carried in L1VPN LSAs advertised\n  \
    \ by a specific TE.\n   The reason why it is required that the value specified\
    \ in the PE TE\n   Address field of the L1VPN Info TLV matches a valid PE TE Router\
    \ ID\n   or numbered TE Link ID is to ensure that CEs attached to this PE can\n\
    \   be resolved to the PE as it is known to the Traffic Engineering\n   Database\
    \ (TED) and hence TE paths toward the CEs across the provider\n   domain can be\
    \ computed.\n   Let us consider the example presented in Figure 2.\n         \
    \                   CE11               CE13\n                              | \

    \            CE24\n                    Figure 2: Single Area Configuration\n \
    \  Let us assume that PE1 is connected to CE11 and CE15 in L1VPN1 and to\n   CE22\
    \ in L1VPN2; PE2 is connected to CE13 in L1VPN1; PE3 is connected\n   to CE24\
    \ in L1VPN2.  In this configuration PE1 manages two PITs: PIT1\n   for L1VPN1\
    \ and PIT2 for L1VPN2; PE2 manages only PIT1; and PE3\n   manages only PIT2. \
    \ PE1 originates three L1VPN LSAs, each containing\n   a L1VPN Info TLV advertising\
    \ links PE1-CE11, PE1-CE22, and PE1-CE15,\n   respectively.  PE2 originates a\
    \ single L1VPN LSA for link PE2-CE13,\n   and PE3 originates a single L1VPN LSA\
    \ for link PE3-CE24.  In steady\n   state, the PIT1 on PE1 and PE3 will contain\
    \ information on links\n   PE1-CE11, PE1-CE15, and PE2-CE13; PIT2 on PE1 and PE2\
    \ will contain\n   entries for links PE1-CE22 and PE3-CE24.  Thus, all PEs will\
    \ learn\n   about all remote PE-to-CE links for all L1VPNs supported by PEs.\n\
    \   Note that P in this configuration does not have links connecting it\n   to\
    \ any L1VPNs.  It neither originates L1VPN LSAs nor maintains any\n   PITs.  However,\
    \ it does participate in the flooding of all of the\n   L1VPN LSAs and hence maintains\
    \ the LSAs in its LSDB.  This is a cause\n   for scalability concerns and could\
    \ prove to be problematic in large\n   networks.\n"
- title: 4.  Backward Compatibility
  contents:
  - "4.  Backward Compatibility\n   Neither the TLV nor the LSA introduced in this\
    \ document present any\n   interoperability issues.  Per [RFC5250], OSPF speakers\
    \ that do not\n   support the L1VPN auto-discovery application (Ps for example)\
    \ just\n   participate in the L1VPN LSAs flooding process but should ignore the\n\
    \   LSAs contents.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The approach presented in this document describes\
    \ how PEs dynamically\n   learn L1VPN-specific information.  Mechanisms to deliver\
    \ the VPN\n   membership information to CEs are explicitly out of scope of this\n\
    \   document.  Therefore, the security issues raised in this document are\n  \
    \ limited to within the OSPF domain.\n   This defined approach reuses mechanisms\
    \ defined in [RFC2328] and\n   [RFC5250].  Therefore, the same security approaches\
    \ and\n   considerations apply to this approach.  OSPF provides several\n   security\
    \ mechanisms that can be applied.  Specifically, OSPF supports\n   multiple types\
    \ of authentication, limits the frequency of LSA\n   origination and acceptance,\
    \ and provides techniques to avoid and\n   limit impact database overflow.  In\
    \ cases where end-to-end\n   authentication is desired, OSPF's neighbor-to-neighbor\
    \ authentication\n   approach can be augmented with an experimental extension\
    \ to OSPF; see\n   [RFC2154], which supports the signing and authentication of\
    \ LSAs.\n"
