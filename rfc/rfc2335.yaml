  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a method for distributing an NHRP service\n\
    \   within a LIS [1].  This method uses the Server Cache Synchronization\n   Protocol\
    \ (SCSP) [2] to synchronize the client information databases\n   held by NHRP\
    \ Servers (NHSs) within a LIS.\n"

  - "1. Introduction\n   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT,\
    \ SHOULD,\n   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in\
    \ this\n   document, are to be interpreted as described in [4].\n   NHRP Clients\
    \ (NHCs) register their existence and reachability\n   information with NHRP Servers\
    \ (NHSs).  There may be multiple NHSs in\n   a given Logical IP Subnet (LIS).\
    \  NHCs do not necessarily register\n   with all NHSs in a LIS; however, all NHCs\
    \ need to be able to query at\n   least one NHS about any NHC within the LIS.\
    \  Thus, the contents of\n   the NHS databases in a LIS need to be synchronized\
    \ across the LIS.\n   The Server Cache Synchronization Protocol (SCSP) solves\
    \ the\n   generalized server synchronization/cache-replication problem for\n \
    \  distributed databases and thus SCSP may be applied to the NHS\n   database\
    \ synchronization problem within the LIS.\n   SCSP is defined in two parts: the\
    \ protocol independent part and the\n   client/server protocol specific part.\
    \  The protocol independent part\n   is defined in [2] whereas this document will\
    \ specify the\n   client/server protocol specific part where NHRP is the client/server\n\
    \   protocol.\n   This document is separate from [2] because it was felt that\
    \ it was\n   desirable to allow the client/server protocol specific part\n   specification\
    \ for NHRP to progress independently from the protocol\n   independent specification.\n"
- title: 2. Overview
  contents:
  - "2. Overview\n   All NHSs belonging to a Logical IP Subnet (LIS) [1] are said\
    \ to\n   belong to a Server Group (SG).  An SG is identified by, not\n   surprisingly,\
    \ its SGID which is contained in a field in all SCSP\n   packets.  All SCSP packets\
    \ contain a Protocol ID (PID) field as well.\n   This PID field is set to 0x0002\
    \ to signify that SCSP synchronizing\n   NHS databases as opposed to synchronizing\
    \ some other protocol's\n   databases (see Section B.2.0.1 of [2] for more details).\
    \  In general,\n   PIDs for SCSP will be assigned by IANA as described in Section\
    \ C of\n   [2].  In the case of NHRP, the client/server protocol specific\n  \
    \ specification was initially written at the same time as SCSP, and\n   thus a\
    \ PID=0x0002 was assigned by the author.\n   SCSP places no topological requirements\
    \ upon an NHRP SG.  Obviously,\n   however, the resultant graph of NHSs must span\
    \ the set of NHSs to be\n   synchronized.  For more information about the client/server\
    \ protocol\n   independent part of SCSP, the reader is encouraged to see [2].\n\
    \   When a SG is using SCSP for synchronization, an NHC will register\n   with\
    \ only one NHS, but the NHC MAY use any NHS in the SG.  When an\n   NHC wishes\
    \ to leave a SG, the NHC MUST do one of the following: 1)\n   the NHC MUST send\
    \ an NHRP Purge Request for itself requesting a\n   reply, and it MUST wait for\
    \ an NHRP Purge Reply, 2) the NHC MUST keep\n   the Request ID it used when registering\
    \ itself in non-volatile RAM\n   and use a Request ID larger than the one saved\
    \ when re-registering,\n   or 3) the NHC MUST not re-register for a time equal\
    \ to the Holding\n   Time specified in the previous registration.  It is necessary\
    \ to do\n   one of the previous in order to prevent the unlikely case of race\n\
    \   conditions from occurring during updated.  In the case where method 2\n  \
    \ is used, the NHS with which the NHC registered uses its ID as the OID\n   and\
    \ the Request ID from the NHC as the CSA Sequence Number in the\n   CSA(S) Record.\n"
