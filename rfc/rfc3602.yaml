  - "1.  Introduction\n   As the culmination of a four-year competitive process, NIST
    (the\n   National Institute of Standards and Technology) has selected the AES\n
    \  (Advanced Encryption Standard), the successor to the venerable DES\n   (Data
    Encryption Standard).  The competition was an open one, with\n   public participation
    and comment solicited at each step of the\n   process.  The AES [AES], formerly
    known as Rijndael, was chosen from\n   a field of five finalists.\n   The AES
    selection was made on the basis of several characteristics:\n      +  security\n
    \     +  unclassified\n      +  publicly disclosed\n      +  available royalty-free,
    worldwide\n      +  capable of handling a block size of at least 128 bits\n      +
    \ at a minimum, capable of handling key sizes of 128, 192, and\n         256 bits\n
    \     +  computational efficiency and memory requirements on a variety\n         of
    software and hardware, including smart cards\n      +  flexibility, simplicity
    and ease of implementation\n   The AES will be the government's designated encryption
    cipher.  The\n   expectation is that the AES will suffice to protect sensitive\n
    \  (unclassified) government information until at least the next\n   century.
    \ It is also expected to be widely adopted by businesses and\n   financial institutions.\n
    \  It is the intention of the IETF IPsec Working Group that AES will\n   eventually
    be adopted as the default IPsec ESP cipher and will obtain\n   the status of MUST
    be included in compliant IPsec implementations.\n   The remainder of this document
    specifies the use of the AES within\n   the context of IPsec ESP.  For further
    information on how the various\n   pieces of ESP fit together to provide security
    services, refer to\n   [ARCH], [ESP], and [ROAD].\n"

    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" that\n   appear in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in\n   [RFC-2119].\n"
  title: 1.1.  Specification of Requirements
- contents:
  - "2.  The AES Cipher Algorithm\n   All symmetric block cipher algorithms share
    common characteristics\n   and variables, including mode, key size, weak keys,
    block size, and\n   rounds.  The following sections contain descriptions of the
    relevant\n   characteristics of the AES cipher.\n"
  title: 2.  The AES Cipher Algorithm
- contents:
  - "2.1.  Mode\n   NIST has defined 5 modes of operation for AES and other FIPS-approved\n
    \  ciphers [MODES]: CBC (Cipher Block Chaining), ECB (Electronic\n   CodeBook),
    CFB (Cipher FeedBack), OFB (Output FeedBack) and CTR\n   (Counter).  The CBC mode
    is well-defined and well-understood for\n   symmetric ciphers, and is currently
    required for all other ESP\n   ciphers.  This document specifies the use of the
    AES cipher in CBC\n   mode within ESP.  This mode requires an Initialization Vector
    (IV)\n   that is the same size as the block size.  Use of a randomly generated\n
    \  IV prevents generation of identical ciphertext from packets which\n   have
    identical data that spans the first block of the cipher\n   algorithm's block
    size.\n   The IV is XOR'd with the first plaintext block before it is\n   encrypted.
    \ Then for successive blocks, the previous ciphertext block\n   is XOR'd with
    the current plaintext, before it is encrypted.\n   More information on CBC mode
    can be obtained in [MODES, CRYPTO-S].\n   For the use of CBC mode in ESP with
    64-bit ciphers, see [CBC].\n"
  title: 2.1.  Mode
- contents:
  - "2.2.  Key Size and Number of Rounds\n   AES supports three key sizes: 128 bits,
    192 bits, and 256 bits.  The\n   default key size is 128 bits, and all implementations
    MUST support\n   this key size.  Implementations MAY also support key sizes of
    192\n   bits and 256 bits.\n   AES uses a different number of rounds for each
    of the defined key\n   sizes.  When a 128-bit key is used, implementations MUST
    use 10\n   rounds.  When a 192-bit key is used, implementations MUST use 12\n
    \  rounds.  When a 256-bit key is used, implementations MUST use 14\n   rounds.\n"
  title: 2.2.  Key Size and Number of Rounds
- contents:
  - "2.3.  Weak Keys\n   At the time of writing this document there are no known weak
    keys for\n   the AES.\n   Some cipher algorithms have weak keys or keys that MUST
    not be used\n   due to their interaction with some aspect of the cipher's definition.\n
    \  If weak keys are discovered for the AES, then weak keys SHOULD be\n   checked
    for and discarded when using manual key management.  When\n   using dynamic key
    management, such as [IKE], weak key checks SHOULD\n   NOT be performed as they
    are seen as an unnecessary added code\n   complexity that could weaken the intended
    security [EVALUATION].\n"
  title: 2.3.  Weak Keys
- contents:
  - "2.4.  Block Size and Padding\n   The AES uses a block size of sixteen octets
    (128 bits).\n   Padding is required by the AES to maintain a 16-octet (128-bit)\n
    \  blocksize.  Padding MUST be added, as specified in [ESP], such that\n   the
    data to be encrypted (which includes the ESP Pad Length and Next\n   Header fields)
    has a length that is a multiple of 16 octets.\n   Because of the algorithm specific
    padding requirement, no additional\n   padding is required to ensure that the
    ciphertext terminates on a 4-\n   octet boundary (i.e., maintaining a 16-octet
    blocksize guarantees\n   that the ESP Pad Length and Next Header fields will be
    right aligned\n   within a 4-octet word).  Additional padding MAY be included,
    as\n   specified in [ESP], as long as the 16-octet blocksize is maintained.\n"

    and Vincent Rijmen\n   from ESAT-COSIC, both in Belgium, and is available world-wide
    on a\n   royalty-free basis.  It is not covered by any patents, and the\n   Rijndael
    homepage contains the following statement: \"Rijndael is\n   available for free.
    \ You can use it for whatever purposes you want,\n   irrespective of whether it
    is accepted as AES or not.\"  AES's\n   description can be found in [AES].  The
    Rijndael homepage is:\n   http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/~rijmen/rijndael/.\n
    \  The AES homepage, http://www.nist.gov/aes, contains a wealth of\n   information
    about the AES, including a definitive description of the\n   AES algorithm, performance
    statistics, test vectors and intellectual\n   property information.  This site
    also contains information on how to\n   obtain an AES reference implementation
    from NIST.\n"

  - "3.  ESP Payload\n   The ESP payload is made up of the IV followed by raw cipher-text.\n
    \  Thus the payload field, as defined in [ESP], is broken down according\n   to
    the following diagram:\n   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+\n
    \  |                                                               |\n   +               Initialization

    \  +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+\n   |                                                               |\n
    \  ~ Encrypted Payload (variable length, a multiple of 16 octets)  ~\n   |                                                               |\n
    \  +---------------------------------------------------------------+\n   The IV
    field MUST be the same size as the block size of the cipher\n   algorithm being
    used.  The IV MUST be chosen at random, and MUST be\n   unpredictable.\n   Including
    the IV in each datagram ensures that decryption of each\n   received datagram
    can be performed, even when some datagrams are\n   dropped, or datagrams are re-ordered
    in transit.\n   To avoid CBC encryption of very similar plaintext blocks in different\n
    \  packets, implementations MUST NOT use a counter or other low-Hamming\n   distance
    source for IVs.\n"

  - "3.1.  ESP Algorithmic Interactions\n   Currently, there are no known issues regarding
    interactions between\n   the AES and other aspects of ESP, such as use of certain\n
    \  authentication schemes.\n"
  title: 3.1.  ESP Algorithmic Interactions
- contents:
  - "3.2.  Keying Material\n   The minimum number of bits sent from the key exchange
    protocol to the\n   ESP algorithm must be greater than or equal to the key size.\n
    \  The cipher's encryption and decryption key is taken from the first\n   <x>
    bits of the keying material, where <x> represents the required\n   key size.\n"

- contents:
  - "4.  Test Vectors\n   The first 4 test cases test AES-CBC encryption.  Each test
    case\n   includes the key, the plaintext, and the resulting ciphertext.  The\n
    \  values of keys and data are either hexadecimal numbers (prefixed by\n   \"0x\")
    or ASCII character strings (surrounded by double quotes).  If a\n   value is an
    ASCII character string, then the AES-CBC computation for\n   the corresponding
    test case DOES NOT include the trailing null\n   character ('\\0') of the string.
    \ The computed cyphertext values are\n   all hexadecimal numbers.\n   The last
    4 test cases illustrate sample ESP packets using AES-CBC for\n   encryption.  All
    data are hexadecimal numbers (not prefixed by \"0x\").\n   These test cases were
    verified using 2 independent implementations:\n   the NIST AES-CBC reference implementation
    and an implementation\n   provided by the authors of the Rijndael algorithm\n
    \  (http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/aes/rijndael/\n                          rijndael-unix-refc.tar).\n"

    \  capable of producing output of three different lengths (256, 384 and\n   512
    bits), sufficient for the generation (within IKE) and\n   authentication (within
    ESP) of the three AES key sizes (128, 192 and\n   256 bits).\n   However, HMAC-SHA-1
    [HMAC-SHA] and HMAC-MD5 [HMAC-MD5] are currently\n   considered of sufficient
    strength to serve both as IKE generators of\n   128-bit AES keys and as ESP authenticators
    for AES encryption using\n   128-bit keys.\n"

    key sizes they can\n   when taking into account performance considerations for
    their\n   particular hardware and software configuration.  Note that encryption\n
    \  necessarily impacts both sides of a secure channel, so such\n   consideration
    must take into account not only the client side, but\n   the server as well.  However,
    a key size of 128 bits is considered\n   secure for the foreseeable future.\n
    \  For more information regarding the necessary use of random IV values,\n   see
