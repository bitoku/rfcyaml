  - "1. Introduction\n   As part of the validation process for the development of\
    \ URNs, the\n   IETF URN working group agreed that it is important to demonstrate\n\
    \   that the current URN syntax proposal can accommodate existing\n   identifiers\
    \ from well established namespaces.  One such\n   infrastructure for assigning\
    \ and managing names comes from the\n   bibliographic community.  Bibliographic\
    \ identifiers function as names\n   for objects that exist both in print and,\
    \ increasingly, in electronic\n   formats.  RFC 2288 [Lynch, et al.] investigated\
    \ the feasibility of\n   using three identifiers (ISBN, ISSN and SICI) as URNs.\
    \  This document\n   will analyse the usage of ISBNs as URNs in more detail than\
    \ RFC 2288.\n   A registration request for acquiring Namespace Identifier (NID)\n\

  contents:
  - "3.1 Overview\n   RFC 2288 [Lynch] describes the ISBN system in the following\
    \ way:\n      An International Standard Book Number (ISBN) identifies an edition\n\
    \      of a monographic work.  The ISBN is defined by the standard\n      NISO/ANSI/ISO\
    \ 2108:1992 [ISO1]\n      Basically, an ISBN is a ten-digit number (actually,\
    \ the last digit\n      can be the letter \"X\" as well, as described below) which\
    \ is\n      divided into four variable length parts usually separated by\n   \
    \   hyphens when printed.  The parts are as follows (in this order):\n      *\
    \  a group identifier which specifies a group of publishers, based\n         on\
    \ national, geographic or some other criteria,\n      *  the publisher identifier,\n\
    \      *  the title identifier,\n      *  and a modulus 11 check digit, using\
    \ X instead of 10.\n      The group and publisher number assignments are managed\
    \ in such a\n      way that the hyphens are not needed to parse the ISBN\n   \
    \   unambiguously into its constituent parts.  However, the ISBN is\n      normally\
    \ transmitted and displayed with hyphens to make it easy\n      for human beings\
    \ to recognize these parts without having to make\n      reference to or have\
    \ knowledge of the number assignments for group\n      and publisher identifiers.\n\
    \   Groups usually cover only one country, but occasionally a single\n   group\
    \ is used in several countries.  For instance, group \"3\" is\n   utilised in\
    \ Germany, Austria and German-speaking parts of\n   Switzerland.  \"976\" is used\
    \ in Caribbean community (Antigua, Bahamas,\n   Barbados, Belize, Cayman Islands,\
    \ Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica,\n   Montserrat, St. Kitts-Nevis, St. Lucia,\
    \ St. Vincent and the\n   Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, Virgin Islands (Br))and\
    \ \"982\" in\n   South Pacific (Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands,\
    \ Nauru,\n   Niue, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu; Vanuatu, Western\n\
    \   Samoa).  For each international group, the International ISBN Agency\n   has\
    \ assigned ranges of publisher identifiers to individual countries.\n   These\
    \ ranges are listed on the ISBN web site (http://www.isbn.spk-\n   berlin.de/html/prefix.htm).\
    \  The group identifiers are listed at\n   http://www.isbn.spk-berlin.de/html/prefix/allpref.htm.\n\
    \   There are plans to extend the ISBN into 13 digits in order to make\n   the\
    \ system more suitable for identification of electronic monographs.\n   So called\
    \ Bookland ISBN will consist of a traditional ISBN preceded\n   by the 978 or\
    \ 979 EAN flag.\n"
- title: 3.2 Encoding Considerations and Lexical Equivalence
  contents:
  - "3.2 Encoding Considerations and Lexical Equivalence\n   RFC 2288 [Lynch] says\
    \ that:\n      Embedding ISBNs within the URN framework presents no particular\n\
    \      encoding problems, since all of the characters that can appear in\n   \
    \   an ISBN are valid in the identifier segment of the URN.  %-\n      encoding,\
    \ as described in [MOATS] is never needed.\n      Example: URN:ISBN:0-395-36341-1\n\
    \      For the ISBN namespace, some additional equivalence rules are\n      appropriate.\
    \  Prior to comparing two ISBN URNs for equivalence, it\n      is appropriate\
    \ to remove all hyphens, and to convert any\n      occurrences of the letter X\
    \ to upper case.\n"
- title: 3.3 Resolution of ISBN-based URNs
  contents:
  - "3.3 Resolution of ISBN-based URNs\n   The existing ISBN structure is suitable\
    \ for URN resolution purposes.\n   The group identifier can assist in the resolver\
    \ discovery process.\n   For instance, the group identifier \"951\" means Finland.\
    \  In this\n   case, the Finnish national bibliographic database will be able\
    \ to\n   resolve the URN either into bibliographic data or - if the resource\n\
    \   is available in the Internet - to the document itself.\n   If a group identifier\
    \ does not identify a single country but a\n   language area, there are two means\
    \ for locating the correct national\n   bibliography.  First, it is possible to\
    \ define a cascade of URN\n   resolution services - for instance, German national\
    \ bibliography,\n   Austrian national bibliography and Swiss national bibliography,\
    \ in\n   this order - into the DNS records describing the resolution service\n\
    \   for ISBNs starting with \"3\".  Second, the publisher identifier ranges\n\
    \   assigned by the International ISBN Agency could be defined into the\n   DNS\
    \ records.  This method is better than cascading, since the correct\n   resolution\
    \ service can be found immediately.\n   In some exceptional cases - notably in\
    \ the US and in UK, where\n   international companies do a significant portion\
    \ of publishing - the\n   information provided by the group identifier may not\
    \ always be fully\n   reliable.  For instance, some monographs published in New\
    \ York by\n   international publishing companies may get an ISBN with the group\n\
    \   identifier \"3\".  This is technically appropriate when the\n   headquarters\
    \ or one of the offices of the publisher is located in\n   Germany.\n   Information\
    \ about such a book will not be available in the German\n   national bibliography,\
    \ but via the Library of Congress systems.\n   Unfortunately, the appropriate\
    \ national bibliography cannot be known\n   to the resolver discovery service.\n\
    \   As a fall back mechanism a large union catalogue, such as WorldCat\n   maintained\
    \ by OCLC (http://www.oclc.org ) could be used to complement\n   the default services\
    \ provided by national bibliographies.\n   The problem described above may well\
    \ be less severe than it looks.\n   Some international publishers (Springer, for\
    \ example) give the whole\n   production to the national library of their home\
    \ country as legal\n   deposit, no matter which country the book was published.\
    \  Thus\n   everything published by Springer in New York with group identifier\n\
    \   \"3\" will be found from the German national bibliography.  On the\n   other\
    \ hand, when these companies give their home base also as a place\n   of publication,\
    \ the \"home\" national library requires the legal\n   deposit.\n   Due to the\
    \ intelligent structure of ISBN, group identifier or even\n   the publisher identifier\
    \ can be used as a \"hint\".  Technically, it is\n   possible to incorporate into\
    \ the common structure also URN resolution\n   services maintained by publishers.\
    \  For instance, \"951-0\" is the\n   unique ISBN publisher identifier of the\
    \ largest publisher in Finland,\n   Sanoma-WSOY.  If they launch their own URN\
    \ resolution services,\n   resolution requests for ISBNs starting with \"951-0\"\
    \ will be directed\n   to the publisher's server, and all other requests to the\
    \ national\n   bibliography.\n"
- title: 3.4 Additional considerations
  contents:
  - "3.4 Additional considerations\n   The basic guidelines for assigning ISBNs to\
    \ electronic resources are\n   the following:\n   *  Format/means of delivery\
    \ is irrelevant to the decision whether a\n      product needs an ISBN or not.\
    \  If the content meets the\n      requirement, it gets an ISBN, no matter what\
    \ the format of the\n      delivery system.\n   *  Each format of a digital publication\
    \ should have a separate ISBN.\n   The definition of a new edition is normally\
    \ based on one of the two\n   criteria:\n   *  A change in the kind of packaging\
    \ involved: the hard cover\n      edition, the paperback edition and the library-binding\
    \ edition\n      would each get a separate ISBN.  The same applies to different\n\
    \      formats of digital files.\n   *  A change in the text, excluding packaging\
    \ or minor changes such as\n      correcting a spelling error.  Again, this criterion\
    \ applies\n      regardless of whether the publication is in printed or in digital\n\
    \      form.\n   Although these rules seem very clear, their interpretation may\
    \ vary.\n   As [Lynch] points out,\n      The choice of whether to assign a new\
    \ ISBN or to reuse an existing\n      one when publishing a revised printing of\
    \ an existing edition of a\n      work or even a revised edition of a work is\
    \ somewhat subjective.\n      Practice varies from publisher to publisher (indeed,\
    \ the\n      distinction between a revised printing and a new edition is itself\n\
    \      somewhat subjective).  The use of ISBNs within the URN framework\n    \
    \  simply reflects these existing practices.  Note that it is likely\n      that\
    \ an ISBN URN will often resolve to many instances of the work\n      (many URLs).\n\
    \   Publishers have also in some occasions re-used the same ISBN for\n   another\
    \ book.  This reasonably rare kind of human error does not\n   threaten or undermine\
    \ the value of the ISBN system as a whole.\n   Neither do they pose a serious\
    \ threat to the URN resolution service\n   based on ISBNs.  An error will only\
    \ lead into the retrieval of two or\n   more bibliographic records from a national\
    \ bibliographic database.\n   Based on the information in the records, a user\
    \ can choose the\n   correct record from the result set.\n   Most national bibliographies\
    \ and especially the Books in Print\n   correct ISBN mistakes.  The systems then\
    \ provide cross references\n   (\"incorrect ISBN -> correct ISBN\").\n   Further\
    \ details on the process of assigning ISBNs can be found in\n   section 5  (Namespace\
    \ registration) below.\n"

    \   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n   The ISBN (International Standard Book\
    \ Number) is a unique machine-\n   readable identification number, which marks\
    \ any edition of a book\n   unambiguously.  This number is defined in ISO Standard\
    \ 2108.  The\n   number has been in use now for 30 years and has revolutionised\
    \ the\n   international book-trade.  154 countries are officially ISBN members,\n\
    \   and more countries are joining the system.\n   The administration of the ISBN\
    \ system is carried out on three levels:\n      International agency\n      Group\
    \ agencies\n      Publisher levels\n   The International ISBN agency is located\
    \ within the State Library\n   Berlin.  The main functions of the International\
    \ ISBN Agency are:\n   *  To promote, co-ordinate and supervise the world-wide\
    \ use of the\n      ISBN system.\n   *  To approve the definition and structure\
    \ of group agencies.\n   *  To allocate group identifiers to group agencies.\n\

    \ from the ISBN Users'\n   Manual.  4th edition of this document is available\
    \ at\n   http://www.isbn.spk-berlin.de/html/userman.htm.\n   Identifier uniqueness\
    \ considerations:\n   ISBN that has been assigned once should never be re-used.\n\
    \   Nevertheless, publishers do occasionally re-use the same number.\n   From\
    \ the point of the URN resolution system proposed here, this will\n   typically\
    \ cause retrieval of two bibliographic records.  A user can\n   choose the correct\
    \ publication using the data in the record, such as\n   the author or title.\n\
    \   Incorrect ISBNs are routinely corrected in national bibliographies\n   and\
    \ Books in Print catalogue.\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n   The\
    \ ISBN accompanies a publication from its production onwards.  It\n   is persistent;\
    \ ISBN once given - if correct - will never leave the\n   publication.\n   Identifier\
    \ assignment process:\n   Assignment of ISBNs is always controlled by ISBN group\
    \ agencies,\n   which are often national and quite frequently located in the national\n\
    \   libraries.  Publishers are usually given blocks of ISBNs, from which\n   they\
    \ pick identifiers for their newly published items.\n   As pointed out earlier,\
    \ in spite of the common rules of how to use\n   ISBNs, there is some variation\
    \ between different publishers in ISBN\n   assignment.  In practice these differences\
    \ are so small that they do\n   not pose a threat to the usability of the ISBN\
    \ system.\n   Identifier resolution process:\n   URNs based on ISBNs will be primarily\
    \ resolved via the national\n   bibliography databases.  Since ISBN group agencies\
    \ are as a rule\n   located in national libraries, the national bibliography databases\n\
    \   cover almost every publication which does have an ISBN.\n   If group identifier\
    \ does not define a country but a language area\n   there may be many countries\
    \ using the same group identifier.  In such\n   cases, the International ISBN\
    \ Agency has divided publisher\n   identifiers into ranges assigned to each country\
    \ within the group.\n   The appropriate resolution service can be found by using\
    \ the group\n   identifier and publisher identifier information.  Alternatively\
    \ a\n   cascade of national bibliographies can be defined.\n   Resolution carried\
    \ out in national bibliography databases may be\n   complemented by so called\
    \ union catalogues, which contain huge amount\n   of bibliographic data (up to\
    \ 42 million records).  This complementary\n   service is only needed if the ISBN\
    \ group identifier information is\n   misleading.  This is not common.\n   The\
    \ International ISBN Agency maintains a list of publishers who have\n   been assigned\
    \ a publisher identifier within the ISBN system.  The\n   publisher identifier\
    \ may be used to allow participation of resolution\n   services maintained by\
    \ publishers into the URN resolution system for\n   ISBN.\n   Rules for Lexical\
    \ Equivalence:\n   For the ISBN namespace, some additional equivalence rules are\n\
    \   appropriate.  Prior to comparing two ISBN URNs for equivalence, it is\n  \
    \ appropriate to remove all hyphens, and to convert any occurrences of\n   the\
    \ letter X to upper case.\n   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n   Embedding ISBNs\
    \ within the URN framework presents no particular\n   encoding problems, since\
    \ all of the characters that can appear in an\n   ISBN are valid in the identifier\
    \ segment of the URN %-encoding, as\n   described in [MOATS] is never needed.\n\
    \      Example: URN:ISBN:0-395-36341-1\n   Validation mechanism:\n   Validity\
    \ of an ISBN string can be checked by modulus 11 check digit,\n   included in\
    \ the ISBN.  X is used instead of 10.\n   Validity of ISBN assignments can be\
    \ checked from the group agencies\n   or directly from the publisher.\n   Scope:\n\
    \   Global.\n"
