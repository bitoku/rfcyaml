- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes three IPv4 address blocks that are\
    \ provided\n   for use in documentation.  The use of designated address ranges\
    \ for\n   documentation and examples reduces the likelihood of conflicts and\n\
    \   confusion arising from the use of addresses assigned for some other\n   purpose.\n\
    \   [RFC1166] reserves the first of the three address blocks,\n   192.0.2.0/24.\
    \  The other two address blocks have recently been\n   allocated for this purpose,\
    \ primarily to ease the writing of examples\n   involving addresses from multiple\
    \ networks.\n   Other documentation ranges have been defined in the IETF, including\n\
    \   the IPv6 documentation prefix [RFC3849] and example domain names\n   [RFC2606].\
    \  Documentation also makes use of the ranges reserved in\n   [RFC1918].\n"

- title: 3.  Documentation Address Blocks
  contents:
  - "3.  Documentation Address Blocks\n   The blocks 192.0.2.0/24 (TEST-NET-1), 198.51.100.0/24\
    \ (TEST-NET-2),\n   and 203.0.113.0/24 (TEST-NET-3) are provided for use in\n\
    \   documentation.\n"
- title: 4.  Operational Implications
  contents:
  - "4.  Operational Implications\n   Addresses within the TEST-NET-1, TEST-NET-2,\
    \ and TEST-NET-3 blocks\n   SHOULD NOT appear on the public Internet and are used\
    \ without any\n   coordination with IANA or an Internet registry [RFC2050].  Network\n\
    \   operators SHOULD add these address blocks to the list of non-\n   routeable\
    \ address spaces, and if packet filters are deployed, then\n   this address block\
    \ SHOULD be added to packet filters.\n   These blocks are not for local use, and\
    \ the filters may be used in\n   both local and public contexts.\n"
- title: 5.  The Status of 128.66.0.0/16
  contents:
  - "5.  The Status of 128.66.0.0/16\n   Note that 128.66.0.0/16 has been used for\
    \ some examples in the past.\n   However, this block did not appear in the list\
    \ of special prefixes in\n   [RFC3330] or its successors, and the block is therefore\
    \ not reserved\n   for any special purpose.  The block can be used for regular\
    \ address\n   assignments with caution.\n"
