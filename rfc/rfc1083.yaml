    \ This memo describes the state of standardization of protocols used in\n   the\
    \ Internet as determined by the Internet Activities Board (IAB).\n   An overview\
    \ of the standards procedures is presented first, followed\n   by discussions\
    \ of the standardization process and the RFC document\n   series, then the explanation\
    \ of the terms is presented, the lists of\n   protocols in each stage of standardization\
    \ follows, and finally\n   pointers to references and contacts for further information.\n\
    \   This memo is issued quarterly, please be sure the copy you are\n   reading\
    \ is dated within the last three months.  Current copies may be\n   obtained from\
    \ the Network Information Center or from the Internet\n   Assigned Numbers Authority\
    \ (see the contact information at the end of\n   this memo).  Do not use this\
    \ memo after 31-March-89.\n   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n1.  Overview\
    \ of Standards Procedures\n   The Internet Activities Board maintains a list of\
    \ documents that\n   define standards for the Internet protocol suite.  It provides\
    \ these\n   standards with the goal of co-ordinating the evolution of the\n  \
    \ Internet protocols; this co-ordination has become quite important as\n   the\
    \ Internet protocols are increasingly in general commercial use.\n   Protocol\
    \ standards may be proposed by anyone in the Internet\n   community, by writing\
    \ and submitting an RFC.  In general, any\n   proposed protocol will be reviewed\
    \ or developed in the context of\n   some Task Force of the IAB, or some working\
    \ group within that Task\n   Force.  The IAB will assign a proposed protocol to\
    \ a working group if\n   official delegation is necessary.\n   The recommendation\
    \ of the working group or task force is given major\n   consideration in the decision\
    \ by the IAB to assign a state and status\n   to the protocol.  The general policy\
    \ is not to designate a protocol\n   as an official standard until there is implementation\
    \ experience with\n   it.\n   In cases where there is uncertainty as to the proper\
    \ decision\n   concerning a protocol, the IAB may convene a special review committee\n\
    \   consisting of interested parties from the working group and members\n   of\
    \ the IAB itself, with the purpose of recommending some explicit\n   action to\
    \ the IAB.\n   It is possible to proceed with widespread implementation of a\n\
    \   standard without the approval of the IAB.  For example, some vendor\n   standards\
    \ have become very important to the Internet community even\n   though they have\
    \ not been proposed or reviewed by the IAB.  However,\n   the IAB strongly recommends\
    \ that the IAB standards process be used in\n   the evolution of the protocol\
    \ suite to maximize interoperability (and\n   to prevent incompatible protocol\
    \ requirements from arising).  The IAB\n   reserves the use of the term \"standard\"\
    \ in any RFC to only those\n   protocols which the IAB has approved.\n2.  The\
    \ Standardization Process\n   Anyone can invent a protocol, document it, implement\
    \ it, test it, and\n   so on.  The IAB believes that it is very useful to document\
    \ a\n   protocol at an early stage to promote suggestions from others\n   interested\
    \ in the functionality the of protocol and from those\n   interested in protocol\
    \ design.  Once a protocol is implemented and\n   tested it is useful to report\
    \ the results.  The RFC document series\n   is the preferred place for publishing\
    \ these protocol documents and\n   testing results.\n   The IAB encourages the\
    \ documenting of every protocol developed in the\n   Internet (that is, the publication\
    \ of the protocol specification as\n   an RFC), even if it is never intended that\
    \ the protocol become an\n   Internet standard.  A protocol that is not intended\
    \ to become a\n   standard is called \"experimental\".\n   Protocols that are\
    \ intended to become standards are first designated\n   as \"proposed\" protocols.\
    \  It is expected that while in this state the\n   protocol will be implemented\
    \ and tested by several groups.  It is\n   likely that an improved version of\
    \ the protocol will result from this\n   activity.\n   Once a proposed protocol\
    \ has become stable and has a sponsor (an\n   individual willing to speak for\
    \ the protocol to the IAB) it may\n   advance to the \"draft standard\" state.\
    \  In this state, it should be\n   reviewed by the entire Internet community.\
    \  This draft standard state\n   is essentially a warning to the community that\
    \ unless an objection is\n   raised or a flaw is found this protocol will become\
    \ a \"standard\".\n   Once a protocol has been a draft standard for a sufficient\
    \ time\n   (usually 6 months) without serious objections the IAB may act to\n\
    \   declare the protocol an official Internet standard.\n   Some protocols have\
    \ been superseded by better protocols or are\n   otherwise unused.  Such protocols\
    \ are designated \"historic\".\n   In addition to a state (like proposed or standard)\
    \ a protocol is also\n   assigned a status.  A protocol can be required, meaning\
    \ that all\n   systems in the Internet must implement it.  For example, the Internet\n\
    \   Protocol (IP) is required.  A protocol may be recommended, meaning\n   that\
    \ systems should implement this protocol.  A protocol may be\n   elective, meaning\
    \ that systems may implement this protocol; that is,\n   if (and only if) the\
    \ functionality of this protocol is needed or\n   useful for a system it must\
    \ use this protocol to provide the\n   functionality.  A protocol may be termed\
    \ not recommended if it is not\n   intended to be generally implemented; for example,\
    \ experimental or\n   historic protocols.\n   Few protocols are required to be\
    \ implemented in all systems.  This is\n   because there is such a variety of\
    \ possible systems; for example,\n   gateways, terminal servers, workstations,\
    \ multi-user hosts.  It is\n   not necessary for a gateway to implement TCP and\
    \ the protocols that\n   use TCP (though it may be useful).  It is expected that\
    \ general\n   purpose hosts will implement at least IP (including ICMP), TCP and\n\
    \   UDP, Telnet, FTP, SMTP, Mail, and the Domain Name System (DNS).\n3.  The Request\
    \ for Comments Documents\n   The documents called Request for Comments (or RFCs)\
    \ are the working\n   notes of the Internet research and development community.\
    \  A document\n   in this series may be on essentially any topic related to computer\n\
    \   communication, and may be anything from a meeting report to the\n   specification\
    \ of a standard.  All standards are published as RFCs,\n   but not all RFCs specify\
    \ standards.\n   Anyone can submit a document for publication as an RFC.  Submissions\n\
    \   must be made via electronic mail to the RFC Editor (see the contact\n   information\
    \ at the end of this memo).\n   While RFCs are not refereed publications, they\
    \ do receive technical\n   review form the task forces, individual technical experts,\
    \ or the RFC\n   Editor, as appropriate.\n   Once a document is assigned an RFC\
    \ number and published, that RFC is\n   never revised or re-issued with the same\
    \ number.  There is never a\n   question of having the most recent version of\
    \ a particular RFC.\n   However, a protocol (such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP))\
    \ may be\n   improved and re-documented many times in several different RFCs.\
    \  It\n   is important to verify that you have the most recent RFC on a\n   particular\
    \ protocol.  This \"IAB Official Protocol Standards\" memo is\n   the reference\
    \ for determining the correct RFC to refer to for the\n   current specification\
    \ of each protocol.\n   The RFCs are available from the Network Information Center\
    \ at SRI\n   International.  For more information about obtaining RFCs see the\n\
    \   contact information at the end of this memo.\n4.  Other Reference Documents\n\
    \   There are four other reference documents of interest in checking the\n   current\
    \ status of protocol specifications and standardization.  These\n   are the Assigned\
    \ Numbers, the Official Protocols, the Gateway\n   Requirements, and the Host\
    \ Requirements.  Note that these documents\n   are revised and updated at different\
    \ times; in case of differences\n   between these documents, the most recent must\
    \ prevail.\n4.1.  Assigned Numbers\n   This document lists the assigned values\
    \ of the parameters used in the\n   various protocols.  For example, IP protocol\
    \ codes, TCP port numbers,\n   Telnet Option Codes, ARP hardware types, and Terminal\
    \ Type names.\n   Assigned Numbers was most recently issued as RFC-1010.\n   Another\
    \ document, Internet Numbers, lists the assigned IP network\n   numbers, and the\
    \ autonomous system numbers.  Internet Numbers was\n   most recently issued as\
    \ RFC-1062.\n4.2.  Official Protocols\n   This document list the protocols and\
    \ describes any known problems and\n   ongoing experiments.  Official Protocols\
    \ was recently issued as RFC-\n   1011.\n4.3.  Gateway Requirements\n   This document\
    \ reviews the specifications that apply to gateways and\n   supplies guidance\
    \ and clarification for any ambiguities. Gateway\n   Requirement was recently\
    \ issued as RFC-1009.\n4.4.  Host Requirements\n   This document reviews the specifications\
    \ that apply to hosts and\n   supplies guidance and clarification for any ambiguities.\
    \ Host\n   Requirements is in preparation and will be issued soon.\n5.  Explanation\
    \ of Terms\n   There are two independent categorizations of protocols.  The first\
    \ is\n   the state of standardization which is one of \"standard\", \"draft\n\
    \   standard\", \"proposed\", \"experimental\", or \"historic\".  The second is\n\
    \   the status of this protocol which is one of \"required\",\n   \"recommended\"\
    , \"elective\", or \"not recommended\".  One could expect a\n   particular protocol\
    \ to move along the scale of status from elective\n   to required at the same\
    \ time as it moves along the scale of\n   standardization from proposed to standard.\n\
    \   At any given time a protocol is a cell of the following matrix.\n   Protocols\
    \ are likely to be in cells in about the following\n   proportions (indicated\
    \ by the number of Xs).  Most will be on the\n   main diagonal.  A new protocol\
    \ is most likely to start in the\n   (proposed, elective) cell, or the (experimental,\
    \ not recommended)\n   cell.\n                     Req   Rec   Ele   Not\n   \

    \   Some protocol are particular to hosts and some to gateways; a few\n   protocols\
    \ are used in both.  The definitions of the terms below will\n   refer to a \"\
    system\" which is either a host or a gateway (or both).\n   It should be clear\
    \ from the context of the particular protocol which\n   types of systems are intended.\n\
    5.1.  Definitions\n   5.1.1.  Standard Protocol\n      The IAB has established\
    \ this as an official standard protocol for\n      the Internet.  These are separated\
    \ into two groups: (1) IP\n      protocol and above, protocols that apply to the\
    \ whole Internet;\n      and (2) network-specific protocols, generally specifications\
    \ of\n      how to do IP on particular types of networks.\n   5.1.2.  Draft Standard\
    \ Protocol\n      The IAB is actively considering this protocol as a possible\n\
    \      Standard Protocol.  Substantial and widespread testing and comment\n  \
    \    is desired.  Comments and test results should be submitted to the\n     \
    \ IAB.  There is a possibility that changes will be made in a Draft\n      Standard\
    \ Protocol before it becomes a Standard Protocol.\n   5.1.3.  Proposed Protocol\n\
    \      These are protocol proposals that may be considered by the IAB for\n  \
    \    standardization in the future.  Implementation and testing by\n      several\
    \ groups is desirable.  Revisions of the protocol\n      specification are likely.\n\
    \   5.1.4.  Experimental Protocol\n      A system should not implement an experimental\
    \ protocol unless it\n      is participating in the experiment and has coordinated\
    \ its use of\n      the protocol with the developer of the protocol.\n      Typically,\
    \ experimental protocols are those that are developed as\n      part of a specific\
    \ ongoing research project not related to an\n      operational service offering.\
    \  While they may be proposed as a\n      service protocol at a later stage, and\
    \ thus become proposed,\n      draft, and then standard protocols, the designation\
    \ of a protocol\n      as experimental is meant to suggest that the protocol,\
    \ although\n      perhaps mature, is not intended for operational use.\n   5.1.5.\
    \  Historic Protocol\n      These are protocols that are unlikely to ever become\
    \ standards in\n      the Internet either because they have been superseded by\
    \ later\n      developments or due to lack of interest.  These are protocols that\n\
    \      are at an evolutionary dead end.\n   5.1.6.  Required Protocol\n      All\
    \ systems must implement the required protocols.\n   5.1.7.  Recommended Protocol\n\
    \      All systems should implement the recommended protocols.\n   5.1.8.  Elective\
    \ Protocol\n      A system may or may not implement an elective protocol. The\n\
    \      general notion is that if you are going to do something like this,\n  \
    \    you must do exactly this.\n   5.1.9.  Not Recommended Protocol\n      These\
    \ protocols are not recommended for general use.  This may be\n      because of\
    \ their limited functionality, specialized nature, or\n      experimental or historic\
    \ state.\n6.  The Protocols\n6.1.  Standard Protocols\nProtocol   Name       \
