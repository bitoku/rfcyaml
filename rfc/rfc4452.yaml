    \ (URI)\n   scheme for information assets that have identifiers in public\n  \
    \ namespaces but are not part of the URI allocation.  By \"information\n   asset\"\
    \ this document intends any information construct that has\n   identity within\
    \ a public namespace.\n"

    \ and indicate\n   requirement levels for compliant implementations.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Information Assets
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Information Assets\n   There exist many information assets with identifiers\
    \ in public\n   namespaces that are not referenceable by URI schemes.  Examples\
    \ of\n   such namespaces include Dewey Decimal Classifications [DEWEY],\n   Library\
    \ of Congress Control Numbers [LCCN], NISO Serial Item and\n   Contribution Identifiers\
    \ [SICI], NASA Astrophysics Data System\n   Bibcodes [BIBCODE], and National Library\
    \ of Medicine PubMed\n   identifiers [PMID].  Other candidate namespaces include\
    \ Online\n   Computer Library Center OCLC Numbers [OCLCNUM] and NISO OpenURL\n\
    \   Framework identifiers [OFI].\n   The \"info\" URI scheme facilitates the referencing\
    \ of information\n   assets that have identifiers in such public namespaces by\
    \ means of\n   URIs.  When referencing an information asset by means of its \"\
    info\"\n   URI, the asset SHALL be considered a \"resource\" as defined in RFC\n\
    \   3986 [RFC3986] and SHALL enjoy the same common syntactic, semantic,\n   and\
    \ shared language benefits that the URI presentation confers.  As\n   such, the\
    \ \"info\" URI scheme enables public namespaces that are not\n   part of the URI\
    \ allocation to be represented within the allocation.\n   The \"info\" URI scheme\
    \ thus provides a bridging mechanism to allow\n   public namespaces to become\
    \ part of the URI allocation.\n   Namespaces declared under the \"info\" URI scheme\
    \ are regulated by an\n   \"info\" Registry mechanism.  The \"info\" Registry\
    \ allows a public\n   namespace that is not part of the URI allocation to be declared\
    \ in a\n   registration process by the organization that manages it (the\n   Namespace\
    \ Authority).  The \"info\" Registry supports the declaration\n   of public namespaces\
    \ that are not part of the URI allocation in a\n   manner that facilitates the\
    \ construction of URIs for information\n   assets without imposing the burdens\
    \ of independent URI registration\n   and maintenance of resource representations\
    \ on the Namespace\n   Authority.  Information assets identified within a registered\n\
    \   namespace SHALL be added or deleted according to the business\n   processes\
    \ of the Namespace Authority, and yet MAY be referenced\n   within network applications\
    \ via the \"info\" URI in an open,\n   standardized way without additional action\
    \ on the part of the\n   Namespace Authority.\n   The \"info\" URI scheme exists\
    \ primarily for identification purposes.\n   Implementations MUST NOT assume that\
    \ an \"info\" URI can be\n   dereferenced to a representation of the resource\
    \ identified by the\n   URI although Namespace Authorities MAY disclose in the\
    \ registration\n   record references to service mechanisms pertaining to identifiers\n\
    \   from the registered namespace.  Applications of the \"info\" URI scheme\n\
    \   are restricted to the identification of information assets and the\n   declaration\
    \ of normalization rules for comparing identifiers of such\n   information assets\
    \ regardless of whether any services relating to\n   such information assets are\
    \ accessible via the Internet.  References\n   to such services MAY be disclosed\
    \ within an \"info\" registration\n   record, but these services SHALL NOT be\
    \ regarded as authoritative.\n   The \"info\" URI scheme does not support global\
    \ resolution methods.\n"
- title: 2.  Application of the "info" URI Scheme
  contents:
  - "2.  Application of the \"info\" URI Scheme\n   Public namespaces that are used\
    \ for the identification of information\n   assets and that are not part of the\
    \ URI allocation MAY be registered\n   as namespaces within the \"info\" Registry.\
    \  Namespace Authorities MAY\n   register these namespaces in the \"info\" Registry,\
    \ thereby making\n   these namespaces available to applications that need to reference\n\
    \   information assets by means of a URI.  Registrations of public\n   namespaces\
    \ that are not part of the URI allocation by parties other\n   than the Namespace\
    \ Authority SHALL NOT be permitted, thereby ensuring\n   against hostile usurpation\
    \ or inappropriate usage of registered\n   service marks or the public namespaces\
    \ of others.\n   Registration of a public namespace under the \"info\" Registry\
    \ implies\n   no particular functionalities of the identifiers from the registered\n\
    \   namespace other than the identification of information assets.  No\n   resolution\
    \ mechanisms can be assumed for the \"info\" URI scheme,\n   though for any particular\
    \ namespace there MAY exist mechanisms for\n   resolving identifiers to network\
    \ services.  The definition of such\n   services falls outside the scope of the\
    \ \"info\" URI scheme.\n   Registration does not define namespace-specific semantics\
    \ for\n   identifiers within a registered namespace, though allowable character\n\
    \   sets and normalization rules are specified in Sections 4 and 5 so as\n   to\
    \ ensure that the URIs created using such identifiers are compliant\n   with applications\
    \ that use URIs.\n   The registration of a public namespace in the \"info\" Registry\
    \ SHALL\n   NOT preclude further development of services associated with that\n\
    \   namespace that MAY qualify the namespace for additional publication\n   elsewhere\
    \ within the URI allocation.\n"

    +\" / \",\" / \";\" / \"=\"\n   An \"info\" URI has an \"info-identifier\" as\
    \ its scheme-specific part\n   and MAY take an optional \"fragment\" component.\
    \  An \"info-identifier\"\n   is constructed by appending an \"identifier\" component\
    \ to a\n   \"namespace\" component separated by a slash \"/\" character.  The\
    \ \"info\"\n   URI scheme is supportive of hierarchical processing as indicated\
    \ by\n   the presence of the slash \"/\" character, although the slash \"/\"\n\
    \   character SHOULD NOT be interpreted as a strict hierarchy delimiter.\n   Values\
    \ for the \"namespace\" component of the \"info\" URI are name\n   tokens composed\
    \ of URI scheme characters only (cf. the \"scheme\"\n   production).  They identify\
    \ the public namespace in which the\n   (unescaped) value for the \"identifier\"\
    \ component originates, and are\n   registered in the \"info\" Registry, which\
    \ guarantees their uniqueness\n   and persistence.  Although the \"namespace\"\
    \ component is\n   case-insensitive, the canonical form is lowercase and documents\
    \ that\n   specify values for the \"namespace\" component SHOULD do so using\n\
    \   lowercase letters.  An implementation SHOULD accept uppercase letters\n  \
    \ as equivalent to lowercase in \"namespace\" names, for the sake of\n   robustness,\
    \ but SHOULD only generate lowercase \"namespace\" names, for\n   consistency.\n\
    \   Values for the \"identifier\" component of the \"info\" URI MAY be viewed\n\
    \   as being hierarchical strings composed of path segments built from\n   path\
    \ segment characters (cf. the \"pchar\" production), the segments\n   being separated\
    \ by slash \"/\" characters, although any semantic\n   interpretation of the \"\
    /\" character as a hierarchy delimiter MUST NOT\n   be assumed.  In their originating\
    \ public namespace, the (unescaped)\n   values for the \"identifier\" component\
    \ identify information assets.\n   The values for the \"identifier\" component\
    \ MUST be %-escaped as\n   required by this syntax.  The \"identifier\" component\
    \ SHOULD be\n   treated as case-sensitive, although the \"info\" Registry MAY\
    \ record\n   the case-sensitivity of identifiers from particular registered public\n\
    \   namespaces.  The \"info\" Registry MAY also disclose additional\n   normalization\
    \ rules regarding the treatment of punctuation characters\n   and the like.\n\
    \   Values for the \"fragment\" component of the \"info\" URI are strings\n  \
    \ composed of path segment characters (cf. the \"pchar\" production) plus\n  \
    \ the slash \"/\" character and the question mark \"?\" character.  No\n   semantic\
    \ role is assigned to the slash \"/\" character and the question\n   mark \"?\"\
    \ character within the \"fragment\" component.  The (unescaped)\n   values for\
    \ the \"fragment\" component identify secondary information\n   assets with respect\
    \ to the primary information asset, which is\n   referenced by the \"info-identifier\"\
    .  The values for the \"fragment\"\n   component MUST be %-escaped as required\
    \ by this syntax.  The\n   \"fragment\" component MUST be treated as being case-sensitive.\n"

    \ case-sensitive, a\n   canonical form MAY only be arrived at by consulting the\
    \ \"info\"\n   Registry for possible information on the case-sensitivity for\n\
    \   identifiers from a registered public namespace, and any case\n   normalization\
    \ step to apply.  The \"info\" Registry MAY also disclose\n   additional normalization\
    \ rules regarding the treatment of punctuation\n   characters and the like.\n\
    \   In cases, however, where no single canonical form of the \"identifier\"\n\
    \   component exists, it is nevertheless RECOMMENDED that a Namespace\n   Authority\
    \ nominate a preferred form, which SHOULD be used wherever\n   possible within\
    \ an \"info\" URI so that applications MAY have an\n   increased chance of successful\
    \ comparison of two \"info\" URIs.\n   Note that \"info\" URIs containing dot-segments\
    \ (i.e., segments whose\n   full content consists of \".\" or \"..\") MAY NOT\
    \ be suitable for use\n   with applications that perform dot-segment normalization.\n\
    \   The following unnormalized forms of an \"info\" URI\n       U1. INFO:PII/S0888-7543(02)96852-7\n\
    \       U2. info:PII/S0888754302968527\n       U3. info:pii/S0888%2D7543%2802%2996852%2D7\n\
    \       U4. info:pii/s0888-7543(02)96852-7\n   are normalized to the following\
    \ respective forms\n       N1. info:pii/S0888-7543(02)96852-7\n       N2. info:pii/S0888754302968527\n\
    \       N3. info:pii/S0888-7543(02)96852-7\n       N4. info:pii/s0888-7543(02)96852-7\n\
    \   The \"info\" URI definition does not prescribe further normalization\n   steps,\
    \ although applications MAY apply additional normalization steps\n   according\
    \ to any rules recorded in the \"info\" Registry for a\n   registered public namespace.\n"

- title: 6.1.  Why Create a New URI Scheme for Identifiers from Public
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Why Create a New URI Scheme for Identifiers from Public\n      Namespaces?\n\
    \   Under RFC 4395, \"Guidelines and Registration Procedures for New URI\n   Schemes\"\
    \ [RFC4395], it is stated in Section 2.1 \"Demonstrable, New,\n   Long-Lived Utility\"\
    \ that \"New URI schemes SHOULD have clear utility\n   to the broad Internet community,\
    \ beyond that available with already\n   registered URI schemes\".  The \"info\"\
    \ URI scheme allows identifiers\n   within public namespaces, used for the identification\
    \ of information\n   assets, to be referred to within the URI allocation.  Once\
    \ a\n   namespace is registered in the \"info\" Registry, the \"info\" URI scheme\n\
    \   enables an information asset with an identifier in that namespace to\n   be\
    \ referenced by means of a URI.  As a result, the information asset\n   SHALL\
    \ be considered a resource as defined in RFC 3986 [RFC3986] and\n   SHALL enjoy\
    \ the same common syntactic, semantic, and shared language\n   benefits that the\
    \ URI presentation confers.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Why Not Use an Existing URI Scheme for Identifiers from Public
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Why Not Use an Existing URI Scheme for Identifiers from Public\n      Namespaces?\n\
    \   Existing URI schemes are not suitable for employment as the \"info\"\n   URI\
    \ scheme admits of no global dereference mechanism.  While examples\n   of resource\
    \ identifiers minted under other URI schemes MAY not always\n   be dereferenceable,\
    \ nevertheless there is always a common expectation\n   that such URIs can be\
    \ dereferenced by various resolution mechanisms,\n   whether they be location-dependent\
    \ or location-independent resource\n   identifiers.  The \"info\" URI scheme applies\
    \ to a class of resource\n   identifiers whose Namespace Authorities MAY or MAY\
    \ NOT choose to\n   disclose service mechanisms.  Nevertheless, Namespace Authorities\
    \ are\n   encouraged to disclose in the \"info\" registration record references\n\
    \   to any such service mechanisms in order to provide a greater utility\n   to\
    \ network applications.\n"
- title: 6.3.  Why Not Create a New URN Namespace ID for Identifiers from Public
  contents:
  - "6.3.  Why Not Create a New URN Namespace ID for Identifiers from Public\n   \
    \   Namespaces?\n   RFC 2141 [RFC2141] states that \"Uniform Resource Names (URNs)\
    \ are\n   intended to serve as persistent, location-independent, resource\n  \
    \ identifiers\".  The \"info\" URI scheme, on the other hand, does not\n   assert\
    \ the persistence of the identifiers created under this scheme\n   but rather\
    \ of the public namespaces grandfathered under this scheme.\n   It exists primarily\
    \ to disclose the identity of information assets\n   and to facilitate a lightweight\
    \ registration mechanism for public\n   namespaces of identifiers managed according\
    \ to the policies and\n   business models of the Namespace Authorities.  The \"\
    info\" URI scheme\n   is neutral with respect to identifier persistence.  Moreover,\
    \ for\n   \"info\" to operate as a URN Network Identifier (NID) would require\n\
    \   that \"info\" be constituted as a delegated naming authority.  It is\n   not\
    \ clear that a URN NID would be an appropriate choice for naming\n   authority\
    \ delegation.\n   Further, the \"info\" URI scheme is not globally dereferenceable\
    \ in\n   contrast to the specific recommendation given in RFC 1737,\n   \"Functional\
    \ Requirements for Uniform Resource Names\" [RFC1737] that\n   \"It is strongly\
    \ recommended that there be a mapping between the names\n   generated by each\
    \ naming authority and URLs\".  Individual Namespace\n   Authorities registered\
    \ in the \"info\" Registry MAY, however, disclose\n   references to service mechanisms\
    \ and are encouraged to do so.\n   An extra consideration is that the \"urn\"\
    \ URI syntax explicitly\n   excludes generic URI hierarchy by reserving the slash\
    \ \"/\" character.\n   An \"info\" URI, on the other hand, admits of hierarchical\
    \ processing,\n   while remaining neutral with respect to supporting actual hierarchy,\n\
    \   and thus allows the slash \"/\" character (as well as more liberally\n   allowing\
    \ the ampersand \"&\" and tilde \"~\" characters).  It therefore\n   represents\
    \ a lower barrier to entry for Namespace Authorities in\n   keeping with its intention\
    \ of acting as a bridging mechanism to allow\n   public namespaces to become part\
    \ of the URI allocation.  In sum, an\n   \"info\" URI is more widely supportive\
    \ of \"human transcribability\" as\n   discussed in RFC 3986 [RFC3986] than is\
    \ a \"urn\" URI.\n   Additionally, the \"urn\" URI syntax does not support \"\
    fragment\"\n   components as does the \"info\" URI syntax for indirect identification\n\
    \   of secondary resources.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The \"info\" URI scheme syntax is subject to\
    \ the same security\n   considerations as the generic URI syntax described in\
    \ RFC 3986\n   [RFC3986].\n   While some \"info\" Namespace Authorities MAY choose\
    \ to disclose\n   service mechanisms, any security considerations resulting from\
    \ the\n   execution of such services fall outside the scope of this document.\n\
    \   It is strongly recommended that the registration record of an \"info\"\n \
    \  namespace include any such considerations.\n"
