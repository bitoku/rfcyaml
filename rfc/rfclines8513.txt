Abstract This document defines a YANG module for the Dual Stack Lite (DS Lite)
Address Family Transition Router (AFTR) and Basic Bridging BroadBand (B4) elements.
This document defines a data model for DS Lite [RFC6333], using the YANG data modeling language [RFC7950].
Both the Address Family Transition Router (AFTR) and Basic Bridging BroadBand (B4) elements are covered by this specification.
Figure 1 is a slight adaptation of Figure 1 from RFC 6333 and is provided here for the convenience of the reader.
DS Lite Base Architecture DS Lite deployment considerations are discussed in [RFC6908].
This document follows the guidelines of [RFC8407], uses the common YANG types defined in [RFC6991], and adopts the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].
This document makes use of the terms defined in Section 3 of [RFC6333].
The terminology for describing YANG data models is defined in [RFC7950].
The meaning of the symbols in tree diagrams is defined in [RFC8340].
An Overview As shown in Figure 1:
The AFTR element is a combination of an IPv4 in IPv6 tunnel and a NAPT function (Section 2.2 of [RFC3022]).
The B4 element is an IPv4 in IPv6 tunnel.
Therefore, the DS Lite YANG module is designed to augment both the Interfaces YANG module [RFC8343] and the NAT YANG module [RFC8512] with DS Lite specific features.
The YANG "feature" statement is used to distinguish which of the DS Lite elements ('aftr' or 'b4') is relevant for a specific data node.
Concretely, the DS Lite YANG module (Figure 2) augments the Interfaces YANG module with the following:  An IPv6 address used by the tunnel endpoint (AFTR or B4) for sending and receiving IPv4 in IPv6 packets (ipv6 address).
An IPv4 address that is used by the tunnel endpoint (AFTR or B4) for troubleshooting purposes (ipv4 address).
An IPv6 address used by a B4 element to reach its AFTR (aftr  ipv6 addr).
The tunnel MTU used to avoid fragmentation (tunnel mtu).
A policy to instruct the tunnel endpoint (AFTR or B4) whether it must preserve Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) marking when encapsulating/decapsulating packets
In addition, the DS Lite YANG module augments the NAT YANG module (policy, in particular) with the following:  A policy to limit the number of DS Lite softwires per subscriber (max softwire per subscriber).
A policy to instruct the AFTR whether a state can be automatically migrated (state migrate).
Further, in order to prevent a Denial of Service (DoS) by frequently changing the source IPv6 address, 'b4 address change  limit' is used to rate limit such changes.
An instruction to rewrite the TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS) option (mss clamping) to avoid TCP fragmentation.
Given that the NAPT table of the AFTR element is extended to include the source IPv6 address of incoming packets, the DS Lite YANG module augments the NAPT44 mapping entry with the following:  b4 ipv6 address, which is used to record the source IPv6 address of a packet received from a B4 element.
This IPv6 address is required to disambiguate between the overlapping IPv4 address space of subscribers.
The value of the Traffic Class field in the IPv6 header as received from a B4 element (v6 dscp): This information is used to preserve DSCP marking when encapsulating/decapsulating at the AFTR.
The IPv4 DSCP marking of the IPv4 packet received from a B4 element (internal v4 dscp): This information can be used by the AFTR for setting the DSCP of packets relayed to a B4 element.
The IPv4 DSCP marking as set by the AFTR in its external interface (external v4 dscp): An AFTR can be instructed to preserve the same marking or to set it to another value when forwarding an IPv4 packet destined to a remote IPv4 host.
Access Control List (ACL) and Quality of Service (QoS) policies discussed in Section 2.5 of [RFC6908] are out of scope.
A YANG module for ACLs is documented in [ACL YANG].
Likewise, considerations that are related to the Port Control Protocol (PCP) and discussed in Section 8.5 of [RFC6333] are out of scope.
A YANG module for PCP is documented in [YANG PCP].
The YANG module "ietf dslite" has the following structure: module: ietf dslite augment
rw v6 v4 dscp preservation?
policy:  rw max softwires per subscriber?
rw b4 address change limit?
mapping entry:  rw b4 ipv6 address {aftr}?
yang:date and time  rw v6 dscp?
notifications:  n b4 address change limit policy violation {aftr}?
DS Lite YANG Tree Diagram Examples to illustrate the use of the "ietf dslite" module are provided in Appendices A and B. 3.
This module uses the tunnel interface identity defined in [RFC7224].

RFC 6908 specifies that since fragmentation and reassembly are not optimal, the operator should do everything possible to eliminate the need for them.
If the operator uses simple IPv4 in IPv6 softwire, it is recommended that the MTU size of the IPv6 network between the B4 and the AFTR account for the additional overhead (40 bytes).
"Copies the DSCP value from the IPv6 header, and vice versa.
According to Section 2.10 of RFC 6908, operators should use the uniform model by provisioning the network such that the AFTR/B4 copies the DSCP value in the IPv4 header to the Traffic Class field in the IPv6 header, after the IPv4 in IPv6 encapsulation."

; description "Configures the maximum softwires per subscriber feature.
A subscriber is uniquely identified by means of a subscriber mask (subscriber mask v6).
This policy aims to prevent a misbehaving subscriber from mounting several DS Lite softwires that would consume additional AFTR resources (e.g., get more external ports if the quota was enforced on a per softwire basis and consume extra processing due to a large number of active softwires).
In the event a new IPv6 address is assigned to the B4 element, the AFTR should migrate existing state to be bound to the new IPv6 address.
This operation ensures that traffic destined to the previous B4's IPv6 address will be redirected to the newer B4's IPv6 address.
The destination IPv6 address for tunneling return traffic from the AFTR should be the last seen as the B4's IPv6 source address from the user device (e.g., CPE).
The AFTR uses the subscriber mask v6 to determine whether two IPv6 addresses belong to the same CPE (e.g., if the subscriber mask v6 is set to 56, the AFTR concludes that 2001:db8:100:100::1 and 2001
:db8:100:100::2 belong to the same CPE assigned with 2001:db8:100:100::/56).
Changing the source B4's IPv6 address may be used as an attack vector.
Packets with a new B4's IPv6 address from the same prefix should be rate limited.
It is recommended that this rate limit be set to 30 minutes; other values can be set on a per deployment basis."

The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].
The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory to implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].
The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory to implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].
The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM)
[RFC8341] provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.
All data nodes defined in the YANG module that can be created, modified, and deleted (i.e., config true, which is the default) are considered sensitive.
Write operations (e.g., edit config) applied to these data nodes without proper protection can negatively affect network operations.
An attacker who is able to access the B4/AFTR can undertake various attacks, such as:  Setting the value of 'aftr ipv6 addr' on the B4 to point to an illegitimate AFTR so that it can intercept all the traffic sent by a B4.
Illegitimately intercepting users' traffic is an attack with severe implications on privacy.
Setting the MTU to a low value, which may increase the number of fragments ('tunnel mtu' for both B4 and AFTR).
Setting 'max softwire per subscriber' to an arbitrary high value, which will be exploited by a misbehaving user to grab more resources (by mounting as many softwires as required to get more external IP addresses/ports) or to perform a DoS on the AFTR by mounting a massive number of softwires.
Setting 'state migrate' to 'false' on the AFTR.
This action may lead to a service degradation for the users.
Setting 'b4 address change limit' to an arbitrary low value can ease DoS attacks based on frequent change of the B4 IPv6 address.
Setting 'v6 v4 dscp preservation' to 'false" may lead to a service degradation if some policies are applied on the network based on the DSCP value.
Additional security considerations are discussed in [RFC8512].
Security considerations related to DS Lite are discussed in [RFC6333].

RFC 8513 Appendix A.  B4 Example
The following example shows a B4 element (2001:db8:0:1::1) that is configured with an AFTR element (2001:db8:0:2::1).
The B4 element is also instructed to preserve the DSCP marking.
db8:0:1::1 </dslite:ipv6 address> <dslite:aftr ipv6 addr> 2001:
aftr ipv6 addr> <dslite:v6 v4 dscp preservation
> true </dslite:v6 v4 dscp preservation> </interface> </interfaces>
The following example shows an AFTR that is reachable at 2001:db8:0:2::1.
Also, this XML snippet indicates that the AFTR is provided with an IPv4 address (192.0.0.1) to be used for troubleshooting purposes such as reporting problems to B4s.
Note that a subscriber is identified by a subscriber mask [RFC7785] that can be configured by means of [RFC8512].
The following shows an XML excerpt depicting a dynamic UDP mapping entry maintained by a DS Lite AFTR for a packet received from the B4 element introduced in Appendix A.  Concretely, this UDP packet received with a source IPv6 address (2001:db8:0:1::1), a source IPv4 address (192.0.2.1), and a source port number (1568) is translated into a UDP packet having a source IPv4 address (198.51.100.1) and source port number (15000).
The remaining lifetime of this mapping is 300 seconds.
