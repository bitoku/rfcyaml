  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document provides extensions to Generalized Multiprotocol\
    \ Label\n   Switching (GMPLS) signaling for control of Wavelength Switched\n \
    \  Optical Networks (WSONs).  Fundamental extensions are given to permit\n   simultaneous\
    \ bidirectional wavelength assignment, while more advanced\n   extensions are\
    \ given to support the networks described in [RFC6163],\n   which feature connections\
    \ requiring configuration of input, output,\n   and general signal processing\
    \ capabilities at a node along a Label\n   Switched Path (LSP).\n   These extensions\
    \ build on previous work for the control of lambda and\n   G.709-based networks.\n\
    \   Related documents are [RFC7446] that provides a high-level\n   information\
    \ model and [RFC7581] that provides common encodings that\n   can be applicable\
    \ to other protocol extensions such as routing.\n"

    \ WSON signaling are in\n   addition to the functionality already provided by\
    \ existing GMPLS\n   signaling mechanisms.\n"
- title: 3.1.  WSON Signal Characterization
  contents:
  - "3.1.  WSON Signal Characterization\n   WSON signaling needs to convey sufficient\
    \ information characterizing\n   the signal to allow systems along the path to\
    \ determine compatibility\n   and perform any required local configuration.  Examples\
    \ of such\n   systems include intermediate nodes (ROADMs, OXCs, wavelength\n \
    \  converters, regenerators, OEO switches, etc.), links (WDM systems),\n   and\
    \ end systems (detectors, demodulators, etc.).  The details of any\n   local configuration\
    \ processes are outside the scope of this document.\n   From [RFC6163], we have\
    \ the following list of WSON signal\n   characteristics:\n   1.  Optical tributary\
    \ signal class (modulation format).\n   2.  FEC: whether forward error correction\
    \ is used in the digital\n      stream and what type of error correcting code\
    \ is used\n   3.  Center frequency (wavelength)\n   4.  Bit rate\n   5.  G-PID:\
    \ General Protocol Identifier for the information format\n   The first three items\
    \ on this list can change as a WSON signal\n   traverses a network with regenerators,\
    \ OEO switches, or wavelength\n   converters.  These parameters are summarized\
    \ in the Optical Interface\n   Class as defined in [RFC7446], and the assumption\
    \ is that a class\n   always includes signal compatibility information.  An ability\
    \ to\n   control wavelength conversion already exists in GMPLS signaling along\n\
    \   with the ability to share client signal type information (G-PID).  In\n  \
    \ addition, bit rate is a standard GMPLS signaling traffic parameter.\n   It is\
    \ referred to as bandwidth encoding in [RFC3471].\n"
- title: 3.2.  Per-Node Processing Configuration
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Per-Node Processing Configuration\n   In addition to configuring a node\
    \ along an LSP to input or output a\n   signal with specific attributes, we may\
    \ need to signal the node to\n   perform specific processing, such as 3R regeneration,\
    \ on the signal\n   at a particular node.  [RFC6163] discussed three types of\
    \ processing:\n      (A) Regeneration (possibly different types)\n      (B) Fault\
    \ and Performance Monitoring\n      (C) Attribute Conversion\n   The extensions\
    \ here provide for the configuration of these types of\n   processing at nodes\

    \ with the wavelength\n   continuity constraint for bidirectional connections.\
    \  The following\n   cases need to be supported separately:\n   (a)  Where the\
    \ same wavelength is used for both upstream and\n        downstream directions\n\
    \   (b)  Where different wavelengths are used for both upstream and\n        downstream\
    \ directions.\n   This document will review existing GMPLS bidirectional solutions\n\
    \   according to WSON case.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Distributed Wavelength Assignment Selection Method
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Distributed Wavelength Assignment Selection Method\n   WSON signaling can\
    \ support the selection of a specific distributed\n   wavelength assignment method.\n\
    \   This method is beneficial in cases of equipment failure, etc., where\n   fast\
    \ provisioning used in quick recovery is critical to protect\n   carriers/users\
    \ against system loss.  This requires efficient\n   signaling that supports distributed\
    \ wavelength assignment, in\n   particular, when the wavelength assignment capability\
    \ is not\n   available.\n   As discussed in [RFC6163], different computational\
    \ approaches for\n   wavelength assignment are available.  One method is the use\
    \ of\n   distributed wavelength assignment.  This feature would allow the\n  \
    \ specification of a particular approach when more than one is\n   implemented\
    \ in the systems along the path.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  WSON Signal Traffic Parameters, Attributes, and Processing\n   As discussed\
    \ in [RFC6163], single-channel optical signals used in\n   WSONs are called \"\
    optical tributary signals\" and come in a number of\n   classes characterized\
    \ by modulation format and bit rate.  Although\n   WSONs are fairly transparent\
    \ to the signals they carry, to ensure\n   compatibility amongst various networks\
    \ devices and end systems, it\n   can be important to include key lightpath characteristics\
    \ as traffic\n   parameters in signaling [RFC6163].\n   LSPs signaled through\
    \ extensions provided in this document MUST apply\n   the following signaling\
    \ parameters:\n      o  Switching Capability = WSON-LSC [RFC7688]\n      o  Encoding\
    \ Type = Lambda [RFC3471]\n      o  Label Format = as defined in [RFC6205]\n \

    \ considerations of the existing GMPLS signaling protocol\n   mechanisms.  See\
    \ [RFC3473] for details of the supported security\n   measures.  Additionally,\
