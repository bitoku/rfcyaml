- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE) extensions are used to advertise TE\n\
    \   Link State Advertisements (LSAs) containing information about TE-\n   enabled\
    \ links.  The only addresses belonging to a router that are\n   advertised in\
    \ TE LSAs are the local addresses corresponding to TE-\n   enabled links, and\
    \ the local address corresponding to the Router ID.\n   In order to allow other\
    \ routers in a network to compute Multiprotocol\n   Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic\
    \ Engineered Label Switched Paths (TE\n   LSPs) to a given router's local addresses,\
    \ those addresses must also\n   be advertised by OSPF TE.\n   This document describes\
    \ procedures that enhance OSPF TE to advertise\n   a router's local addresses.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Motivation\n   In some cases, it is desirable to set up constrained shortest\
    \ path\n   first (CSPF) computed Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic\n\
    \   Engineered Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) to local addresses of a\n   router\
    \ that are not currently advertised in the TE LSAs, i.e.,\n   loopback and non-TE\
    \ interface addresses.\n   For instance, in a network carrying VPN and non-VPN\
    \ traffic, it is\n   often desirable to use different MPLS TE LSPs for the VPN\
    \ traffic and\n   the non-VPN traffic.  In this case, one loopback address may\
    \ be used\n   as the BGP next-hop for VPN traffic while another may be used as\
    \ the\n   BGP next-hop for non-VPN traffic.  It is also possible that different\n\
    \   BGP sessions are used for VPN and non-VPN services.  Hence, two\n   separate\
    \ MPLS TE LSPs are desirable -- one to each loopback address.\n   However, current\
    \ routers in an OSPF network can only use CSPF to\n   compute MPLS TE LSPs to\
    \ the router ID or the local addresses of a\n   remote router's TE-enabled links.\
    \  This restriction arises because\n   OSPF TE extensions [RFC3630, RFC5329] only\
    \ advertise the router ID\n   and the local addresses of TE-enabled links of a\
    \ given router.  Other\n   routers in the network can populate their traffic engineering\n\
    \   database (TED) with these local addresses belonging to the\n   advertising\
    \ router.  However, they cannot populate the TED with the\n   advertising router's\
    \ other local addresses, i.e., loopback and non-TE\n   interface addresses.  OSPFv2\
    \ stub links in the router LSA [RFC2328]\n   provide stub reachability information\
    \ to the router but are not\n   sufficient to learn all the local addresses of\
    \ a router.  In\n   particular for a subnetted point-to-point (P2P) interface\
    \ the stub,\n   link ID is the subnet address.  While for a non-subnetted interface,\n\
    \   the stub link ID is the neighbor address.  Intra-prefix LSAs in\n   OSPFv3\
    \ [RFC5340] are also not sufficient to learn the local\n   addresses.\n   For\
    \ the above reasons, this document defines an enhancement to OSPF\n   TE extensions\
    \ to advertise the local addresses of a node.\n"

    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Rejected Potential Solution
  contents:
  - "3.  Rejected Potential Solution\n   A potential solution would be to advertise\
    \ a TE link TLV for each\n   local address, possibly with a new link type.  However,\
    \ this is\n   inefficient since the only meaningful information is the address.\n\
    \   Furthermore, this would require implementations to process these TE\n   link\
    \ TLVs differently from others; for example, the TE metric is\n   normally considered\
    \ a mandatory sub-TLV, but would have no meaning\n   for a local address.\n"
- title: 4.  Solution
  contents:
  - "4.  Solution\n   The solution is to advertise the local addresses of a router\
    \ in a new\n   OSPF TE LSA Node Attribute TLV.  It is anticipated that the Node\n\
    \   Attribute TLV will also prove more generally useful.\n"

    \ on the local configuration of the advertising router.  The\n   default behavior\
    \ MAY be to advertise all the loopback interface\n   addresses.\n   The Node Attribute\
    \ TLV MUST NOT appear in more than one TE LSA\n   originated by a router.  Furthermore,\
    \ such an LSA MUST NOT include\n   more than one Node Attribute TLV.  A Node Attribute\
    \ TLV MUST NOT\n   carry more than one Node IPv4 Local Address sub-TLV.  A Node\n\

    \      o  Types in the range 3-32767 are to be assigned via Standards\n      \

    \ at this\n         time.  Before any assignments can be made in this range, there\n\
