  - "Abstract\n   The IPv6 addressing architecture includes a unicast interface\n\
    \   identifier that is used in the creation of many IPv6 addresses.\n   Interface\
    \ identifiers are formed by a variety of methods.  This\n   document clarifies\
    \ that the bits in an interface identifier have no\n   meaning and that the entire\
    \ identifier should be treated as an opaque\n   value.  In particular, RFC 4291\
    \ defines a method by which the\n   Universal and Group bits of an IEEE link-layer\
    \ address are mapped\n   into an IPv6 unicast interface identifier.  This document\
    \ clarifies\n   that those two bits are significant only in the process of deriving\n\
    \   interface identifiers from an IEEE link-layer address, and it updates\n  \
    \ RFC 4291 accordingly.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   IPv6 unicast addresses consist of a prefix followed by an\
    \ Interface\n   Identifier (IID).  The IID is supposed to be unique on the links\n\
    \   reached by routing to that prefix, giving an IPv6 address that is\n   unique\
    \ within the applicable scope (link local or global).  According\n   to the IPv6\
    \ addressing architecture [RFC4291], when a 64-bit IPv6\n   unicast IID is formed\
    \ on the basis of an IEEE EUI-64 address, usually\n   itself expanded from a 48-bit\
    \ MAC address, a particular format must\n   be used:\n      For all unicast addresses,\
    \ except those that start with the binary\n      value 000, Interface IDs are\
    \ required to be 64 bits long and to be\n      constructed in Modified EUI-64\
    \ format.\n   Thus, the specification assumes that the normal case is to transform\n\
    \   an Ethernet-style address into an IID, but, in practice, there are\n   various\
    \ methods of forming such an IID.\n   The Modified EUI-64 format preserves the\
    \ information provided by two\n   particular bits in the MAC address:\n   o  The\
    \ \"u/l\" bit in a MAC address [IEEE802] is set to 0 to indicate\n      universal\
    \ scope (implying uniqueness) or to 1 to indicate local\n      scope (without\
    \ implying uniqueness).  In an IID formed from a MAC\n      address, this bit\
    \ is simply known as the \"u\" bit and its value is\n      inverted, i.e., 1 for\
    \ universal scope and 0 for local scope.\n      According to [RFC4291] and [RFC7042],\
    \ the reason for this was to\n      make it easier for network operators to manually\
    \ configure\n      local-scope IIDs.\n      In an IID, this bit is in position\
    \ 6, i.e., position 70 in the\n      complete IPv6 address (when counting from\
    \ 0).\n   o  The \"i/g\" bit in a MAC address is set to 1 to indicate group\n\
    \      addressing (link-layer multicast).  The value of this bit is\n      preserved\
    \ in an IID, where it is known as the \"g\" bit.\n      In an IID, this bit is\
    \ in position 7, i.e., position 71 in the\n      complete IPv6 address (when counting\
    \ from 0).\n   This document discusses problems observed with the \"u\" and \"\
    g\" bits\n   as a result of the above requirements and the fact that various other\n\
    \   methods of forming an IID have been defined independently of the\n   method\
    \ described in Appendix A of RFC 4291.  It then discusses the\n   usefulness of\
    \ these two bits and the significance of the bits in an\n   IID in general.  Finally,\
    \ it updates RFC 4291 accordingly.\n"

- title: 2.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "2.  Problem Statement\n   In addition to IIDs formed from IEEE EUI-64 addresses,\
    \ various new\n   forms of IIDs have been defined, including temporary addresses\n\
    \   [RFC4941], Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs) [RFC3972]\n   [RFC4982],\
    \ Hash-Based Addresses (HBAs) [RFC5535], and ISATAP\n   addresses [RFC5214]. \
    \ Other methods have been proposed, such as\n   stable privacy addresses [IID-SLAAC]\
    \ and mapped addresses for 4rd\n   [SOFTWR-4RD].  In each case, the question of\
    \ how to set the \"u\" and\n   \"g\" bits has to be decided.  For example, RFC\
    \ 3972 specifies that\n   they are both zero in CGAs, and RFC 4982 describes them\
    \ as if they\n   were reserved bits.  The same applies to HBAs.  On the other\
    \ hand,\n   RFC 4941 specifies that \"u\" must be zero but leaves \"g\" variable.\n\
    \   The NAT64 addressing format [RFC6052] sets the whole byte containing\n   \"\
    u\" and \"g\" to zero.\n   Another case where the \"u\" and \"g\" bits are specified\
    \ is in the\n   Reserved IPv6 Subnet Anycast Address format [RFC2526], which states\n\
    \   that \"for interface identifiers in EUI-64 format, the universal/local\n \
    \  bit in the interface identifier MUST be set to 0\" (i.e., local) and\n   the\
    \ \"g\" bit is required to be set to 1.  However, the text neither\n   states\
    \ nor implies any semantics for these bits in anycast addresses.\n   A common\
    \ operational practice for well-known servers is to manually\n   assign a small\
    \ number as the IID, in which case \"u\" and \"g\" are both\n   zero.\n   These\
    \ cases illustrate that the statement quoted above from RFC 4291\n   requiring\
    \ \"Modified EUI-64 format\" is inapplicable when applied to\n   forms of IID\
    \ that are not in fact based on an underlying EUI-64\n   address.  In practice,\
    \ the IETF has chosen to assign some 64-bit IIDs\n   that have nothing to do with\
    \ EUI-64.\n   A particular case is that of /127 prefixes for point-to-point links\n\
    \   between routers, as standardised by [RFC6164].  The addresses on\n   these\
    \ links are undoubtedly global unicast addresses, but they do not\n   have a 64-bit\
    \ IID.  The bits in the positions named \"u\" and \"g\" in\n   such an IID have\
    \ no special significance and their values are not\n   specified.\n   Each time\
    \ a new IID format is proposed, the question arises whether\n   these bits have\
    \ any meaning.  Section 2.2.1 of [RFC7042] discusses\n   the mechanics of the\
    \ bit allocations but does not explain the purpose\n   or usefulness of these\
    \ bits in an IID.  There is an IANA registry for\n   reserved IID values [RFC5453],\
    \ but again there is no explanation of\n   the purpose of the \"u\" and \"g\"\
    \ bits.\n   There was a presumption when IPv6 was designed and the IID format\
    \ was\n   first specified that a universally unique IID might prove to be very\n\
    \   useful, for example to contribute to solving the multihoming problem.\n  \
    \ Indeed, the addressing architecture [RFC4291] states this explicitly:\n    \
    \  The use of the universal/local bit in the Modified EUI-64 format\n      identifier\
    \ is to allow development of future technology that can\n      take advantage\
    \ of interface identifiers with universal scope.\n   However, so far, this has\
    \ not proved to be the case.  Also, there is\n   evidence from the field that\
    \ MAC addresses with universal scope are\n   sometimes assigned to multiple MAC\
    \ interfaces.  There are recurrent\n   reports of manufacturers assigning the\
    \ same MAC address to multiple\n   devices, and significant reuse of the same\
    \ virtual MAC address is\n   reported in virtual machine environments.  Once transformed\
    \ into IID\n   format (with \"u\" = 1), these identifiers would purport to be\n\
    \   universally unique but would in fact be ambiguous.  This has no known\n  \
    \ harmful effect as long as the replicated MAC addresses and IIDs are\n   used\
    \ on different layer 2 links.  If they are used on the same link,\n   of course\
    \ there will be a problem, very likely interfering with\n   link-layer transmission.\
    \  If not, the problem will be detected by\n   duplicate address detection [RFC4862]\
    \ [RFC6775], but such an error\n   can usually only be resolved by human intervention.\n\
    \   The conclusion from this is that the \"u\" bit is not a reliable\n   indicator\
    \ of universal uniqueness.\n   We note that Identifier-Locator Network Protocol\
    \ (ILNP), a\n   multihoming solution that might be expected to benefit from\n\
    \   universally unique IIDs in modified EUI-64 format, does not in fact\n   rely\
    \ on them.  ILNP uses its own format defined as a Node Identifier\n   [RFC6741].\
    \  ILNP has the constraint that a given Node Identifier must\n   be unique within\
    \ the context of a given Locator (i.e., within a\n   single given IPv6 subnetwork).\
    \  As we have just shown, the state of\n   the \"u\" bit does not in any way guarantee\
    \ such uniqueness, but\n   duplicate address detection is available.\n   Thus,\
    \ we can conclude that the value of the \"u\" bit in IIDs has no\n   particular\
    \ meaning.  In the case of an IID created from a MAC address\n   according to\
    \ RFC 4291, its value is determined by the MAC address,\n   but that is all.\n\
    \   An IPv6 IID should not be created from a MAC group address, so the\n   \"\
    g\" bit will normally be zero.  But, this value also has no\n   particular meaning.\
    \  Additionally, the \"u\" and the \"g\" bits are both\n   meaningless in the\
    \ format of an IPv6 multicast group ID [RFC3306]\n   [RFC3307].\n   None of the\
    \ above implies that there is a problem with using the \"u\"\n   and \"g\" bits\
    \ in MAC addresses as part of the process of generating\n   IIDs from MAC addresses,\
    \ or with specifying their values in other\n   methods of generating IIDs.  What\
    \ it does imply is that after an IID\n   is generated by any method, no reliable\
    \ deductions can be made from\n   the state of the \"u\" and \"g\" bits; in other\
    \ words, these bits have no\n   useful semantics in an IID.\n   Once this is recognised,\
    \ we can avoid the problematic confusion\n   caused by these bits each time that\
    \ a new form of IID is proposed.\n"
- title: 3.  Usefulness of the U and G Bits
  contents:
  - "3.  Usefulness of the U and G Bits\n   Given that the \"u\" and \"g\" bits do\
    \ not have a reliable meaning in an\n   IID, it is relevant to consider what usefulness\
    \ they do have.\n   If an IID is known or guessed to have been created according\
    \ to\n   [RFC4291], it could be transformed back into a MAC address.  This can\n\
    \   be very helpful during operational fault diagnosis.  For that reason,\n  \
    \ mapping the IEEE \"u\" and \"g\" bits into the IID has operational\n   usefulness.\
    \  However, it should be stressed that an IID with \"u\" = 1\n   and \"g\" = 0\
    \ might not be formed from a MAC address; on the contrary,\n   it might equally\
    \ result from another method.  With other methods,\n   there is no reverse transformation\
    \ available.\n   Given that the values of the \"u\" and \"g\" bits in an IID have\
    \ no\n   particular meaning, new methods of IID formation are at liberty to\n\
    \   use them as they wish, for example, as additional pseudo-random bits\n   to\
    \ reduce the chances of duplicate IIDs.\n"
- title: 4.  The Role of Duplicate Address Detection
  contents:
  - "4.  The Role of Duplicate Address Detection\n   As mentioned above, Duplicate\
    \ Address Detection (DAD) [RFC4862] is\n   able to detect any case where a collision\
    \ of two IIDs on the same\n   link leads to a duplicated IPv6 address.  The scope\
    \ of DAD may be\n   extended to a set of links by a DAD proxy [RFC6957] or by\
    \ Neighbor\n   Discovery Optimization [RFC6775].  Since DAD is mandatory for all\n\
    \   nodes, there will be almost no case in which an IID collision,\n   however\
    \ unlikely it may be, is not detected.  It is out of scope of\n   most existing\
    \ specifications to define the recovery action after a\n   DAD failure, which\
    \ is an implementation issue.  If a manually created\n   IID, or an IID derived\
    \ from a MAC address according to RFC 4291,\n   leads to a DAD failure, human\
    \ intervention will most likely be\n   required.  However, as mentioned above,\
    \ some methods of IID formation\n   might produce IID values with \"u\" = 1 and\
    \ \"g\" = 0 that are not based\n   on a MAC address.  With very low probability,\
    \ such a value might\n   collide with an IID based on a MAC address.\n   As stated\
    \ in RFC 4862:\n      On the other hand, if the duplicate link-local address is\
    \ not\n      formed from an interface identifier based on the hardware address,\n\
    \      which is supposed to be uniquely assigned, IP operation on the\n      interface\
    \ MAY be continued.\n   Continued operation is only possible if a new IID is created.\
    \  The\n   best procedure to follow for this will depend on the IID formation\n\
    \   method in use.  For example, if an IID is formed by a pseudo-random\n   process,\
    \ that process could simply be repeated.\n"
- title: 5.  Clarification of Specifications
  contents:
  - "5.  Clarification of Specifications\n   This section describes clarifications\
    \ to the IPv6 specifications that\n   result from the above discussion.\n   The\
    \ EUI-64 to IID transformation defined in the IPv6 addressing\n   architecture\
    \ [RFC4291] MUST be used for all cases where an IPv6 IID\n   is derived from an\
    \ IEEE MAC or EUI-64 address.  With any other form\n   of link-layer address,\
    \ an equivalent transformation SHOULD be used.\n   Specifications of other forms\
    \ of 64-bit IIDs MUST specify how all 64\n   bits are set, but a generic semantic\
    \ meaning for the \"u\" and \"g\" bits\n   MUST NOT be defined.  However, the\
    \ method of generating IIDs for\n   specific link types MAY define some local\
    \ significance for certain\n   bits.\n   In all cases, the bits in an IID have\
    \ no generic semantics; in other\n   words, they have opaque values.  In fact,\
    \ the whole IID value MUST be\n   viewed as an opaque bit string by third parties,\
    \ except possibly in\n   the local context.\n   The following statement in Section\
    \ 2.5.1 of the IPv6 addressing\n   architecture [RFC4291]:\n      For all unicast\
    \ addresses, except those that start with the binary\n      value 000, Interface\
    \ IDs are required to be 64 bits long and to be\n      constructed in Modified\

    \ those that start with the binary\n      value 000, Interface IDs are required\
    \ to be 64 bits long.  If\n      derived from an IEEE MAC-layer address, they\
    \ must be constructed\n      in Modified EUI-64 format.\n   The following statement\
    \ in Section 2.5.1 of the IPv6 addressing\n   architecture [RFC4291] is obsoleted:\n\
    \      The use of the universal/local bit in the Modified EUI-64 format\n    \
    \  identifier is to allow development of future technology that can\n      take\
