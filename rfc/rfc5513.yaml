  - "Abstract\n   Three Letter Acronyms (TLAs) are commonly used to identify components\n\
    \   of networks or protocols as designed or specified within the IETF.  A\n  \
    \ common concern is that one acronym may have multiple expansions.\n   While this\
    \ may not have been an issue in the past, network\n   convergence means that protocols\
    \ that did not previously operate\n   together are now found in close proximity.\
    \  This results in\n   contention for acronyms, and confusion in interpretation.\
    \  Such\n   confusion has the potential to degrade the performance of the\n  \
    \ Internet as misunderstandings lead to misconfiguration or other\n   operating\
    \ errors.\n   Given the growing use of TLAs and the relatively small number\n\
    \   available, this document specifies a Badly Construed Proposal (BCP)\n   for\
    \ the management of a registry of TLAs within the IETF, and the\n   procedures\
    \ for the allocation of new TLAs from the registry.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   A Three-Letter Acronym (TLA) is a popular form of abbreviation\n\
    \   usually based on the initial letters of a three-word term.  A formal\n   definition\
    \ of a TLA is provided in Section 2.\n   TLAs are particularly popular within\
    \ the Internet community where\n   they serve as abbreviations in the spoken and\
    \ written word.  As their\n   popularity has grown, the measure of the value of\
    \ an RFC (q.v.) is\n   not only its successful implementation, interoperability,\
    \ and\n   deployment, but also the number of TLAs included in the text.\n   For\
    \ example, the Transmission Control Protocol (itself a TLA - TCP)\n   [RFC0793]\
    \ is extremely successful.  The specification contains no\n   fewer than 20 distinct\
    \ TLAs (although it should be noted that some\n   are simple abbreviations rather\
    \ than proper acronyms).  On the other\n   hand, the Internet Stream Protocol\
    \ Version 2 [RFC1819] is ambiguously\n   referred to using the TLA ST2, and also\
    \ as STII which is clearly not\n   a TLA.  Further, the STII specification contains\
    \ only 12 distinct\n   TLAs, and it should be no surprise that STII has been far\
    \ less\n   successful than TCP.\n   A common concern amongst diligent protocol\
    \ implementers is that one\n   acronym may have multiple expansions.  While this\
    \ may not have been\n   an issue in the past, network convergence means that protocols\
    \ that\n   did not previously operate together are now found in close proximity.\n\
    \   Not only does this result in contention for acronyms, and confusion\n   in\
    \ interpretation of specification, it also leads to many wasted\n   hours trying\
    \ to select appropriate and suitably-unique names for\n   variables within source\
    \ code implementations.  Such confusion has the\n   potential to degrade the performance\
    \ of the Internet as\n   misunderstandings lead to coding errors, compilation\
    \ failures,\n   misconfiguration, and other operating errors.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ it should be noted that we are rapidly approaching World\n   Acronym Depletion\
    \ (WAD).  It has been estimated that, at the current\n   rate of TLA allocation,\
    \ we will run out by the end of September this\n   year.  This timescale could\
    \ be worsened if there is the expected\n   growth in demand for mobile acronyms,\
    \ IP-TLAs, and TLA-on-demand.\n   According to the definition provided in Section\
    \ 2, there are 36**3 -\n   10**3 = 45656 TLAs in total.  This number will so easily\
    \ be depleted\n   that we must institute some policy for conservation.\n   The\
    \ Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA, helpfully, a four-\n   letter acronym\
    \ - although note that a four-letter acronym is an FLA\n   and hence is, in its\
    \ own way, a TLA) maintains registries of names\n   and numbers for use within\
    \ the Internet in order to avoid duplicate\n   allocation of one of those names\
    \ or numbers and the consequent\n   confusion and failed interoperability that\
    \ would arise.  It is,\n   therefore, wholly appropriate that the IANA should\
    \ manage the\n   assignment and use of TLAs within the Internet.\n   This document\
    \ specifies a Badly Construed Proposal for the management\n   of a registry of\
    \ TLAs within the IETF, and the procedures for the\n   allocation of new TLAs\
    \ from the registry.\n"
- title: 1.1.  RFC Editor Terminology List
  contents:
  - "1.1.  RFC Editor Terminology List\n   It is worth observing that the RFC Editor\
    \ currently maintains a list\n   of common terms, abbreviations, and acronyms.\
    \  While this list is\n   highly useful for the construction of documents, it\
    \ does not provide\n   unambiguous interpretation of acronyms.\n"
- title: 2.  Formal Definition of TLA
  contents:
  - "2.  Formal Definition of TLA\n   Acronym - a word made up of the initial letters\
    \ of the words in a\n      phrase.\n      For example, IETF is an acronym formed\
    \ from the first letters of\n      the phrase International Essential Tremor Foundation\
    \ [URL-IETF].\n   Three Letter Acronym (TLA) - an acronym comprising exactly three\n\
    \      letters.\n      For example, RFC is a TLA formed of the first letters of\
    \ the\n      phrase Rugby Football Club [URL-CARDIFF].\n   For our usage, we also\
    \ allow digits within a TLA.  Thus, P2P is an\n   acronym meaning Purchase to\
    \ Pay [URL-P2P].  The digits 2 and 4 are\n   specially used by clever people who\
    \ have noticed that, when spoken,\n   they sound like the words 'to' and 'for'.\
    \  Whether this is helpful\n   may be left as an exercise for the user considering\
    \ the brief\n   conversation, below.\n   A - Do you use the Internet Streams Protocol?\n\
    \   B - Yes.  Do you use ST, too?\n   A - No, I use ST2.\n   B - That's interesting.\
    \  C uses ST2, too.\n   A - I have a car horn application called Toot-toot.\n\
    \   B - Really? Do you use ST2 to Toot-toot, too?\n   Note, however, that an acronym\
    \ made up entirely of digits might be\n   frowned upon.\n   Lastly, we must consider\
    \ case-sensitivity.  Although acronyms often\n   include upper or lowercase letters,\
    \ no assumptions should be made\n   about the interpretation of the acronym based\
    \ on the case of its\n   letters, so that both QOS and QoS clearly refer to the\
    \ Queen of the\n   South football club [URL-QOS] and [URL-QoS].\n"
- title: 2.1.  A Note on Vocalization
  contents:
  - "2.1.  A Note on Vocalization\n   Acronyms are often articulated as words in spoken\
    \ text.  This can be\n   helpful in generating a cosy feel or a marketing buzz\
    \ around a\n   concept that offers a less-favorable reality.  For example, Claws\
    \ and\n   Teeth (CAT) can be pronounced \"cat\" making it seem quite cuddly.\n\
    \   Other acronyms are always spelled out in order to avoid accidental\n   misinterpretation\
    \ or litigation.  For example, do not refer to your\n   neighbor's Daughter or\
    \ Granddaughter as anything other than their\n   D-O-G.\n   But care should be\
    \ taken with vocalization, as well.  It will be\n   noted that some letters have\
    \ more syllables than the words they are\n   used to represent.  In these cases,\
    \ acronyms are to be avoided.\n   Thus, the world wide web must never be assigned\
    \ the acronym WWW.\n   Finally, a word of caution about attempting to pronounce\
    \ acronyms as\n   words.  This can lead to serious injury for the inexperienced\
    \ unless\n   they happen to be native speakers of Czech.  Do not try to say XML\
    \ in\n   front of your mother-in-law, and don't attempt to talk about Open\n \
    \  Office dot Org in polite company.\n"
- title: 3.  Backward and Forward Compatibility
  contents:
  - "3.  Backward and Forward Compatibility\n   It should be obvious to most RFC readers\
    \ (MRRs) that TLAs are already\n   widely used in Internet specifications.  This\
    \ work is not intended to\n   unnecessarily invalidate existing RFCs, although\
    \ where such\n   invalidation is necessary or desirable, this work can be used\
    \ for\n   that purpose.\n   In order to support existing documents, IANA is required\
    \ to search\n   all existing RFCs for every existing acronym usage (EAU), but\
    \ may\n   filter that search to exclude non-TLAs.\n   It will be noted that, as\
    \ a result of that search, many duplicate\n   meanings will be discovered.  For\
    \ example, \"OAM\" will be found in a\n   large number of RFCs, yet its meaning\
    \ may be as diverse as \"on a\n   mission\", \"order of Australia medal\", and\
    \ \"orbital angular momentum\".\n   This contention is best resolved by the judgement\
    \ of Solomon -- each\n   acronym usage will be allocated its share of the letters\
    \ currently in\n   use.  If there are three uses of an acronym, they will get\
    \ one letter\n   each; two existing uses would get one-and-a-half letters each;\
    \ etc.\n"
