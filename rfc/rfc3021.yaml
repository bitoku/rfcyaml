  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   With ever-increasing pressure to conserve IP address space on the\n\
    \   Internet, it makes sense to consider where relatively minor changes\n   can\
    \ be made to fielded practice to improve numbering efficiency.  One\n   such change,\
    \ proposed by this document, is to halve the amount of\n   address space assigned\
    \ to point-to-point links (common throughout the\n   Internet infrastructure)\
    \ by allowing the use of 31-bit subnet masks\n   in a very limited way.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction and Motivation
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction and Motivation\n   The perceived problem of a lack of Internet\
    \ addresses has driven a\n   number of changes in address space usage and a number\
    \ of different\n   approaches to solving the problem:\n   - More stringent address\
    \ space allocation guidelines, enforced by the\n     IANA and the regional address\
    \ assignment authorities [RFC2050].\n   - Use of Network Address Translators (NATs),\
    \ where a small number of\n     IANA-compliant addresses are shared by a larger\
    \ pool of private,\n     non-globally routed addresses topologically behind a\
    \ NAT box\n     [RFC1631].\n   - Deployment of a new Internet Protocol to increase\
    \ the size of the\n     address space.  One such protocol, IPv6 [RFC2460], has\
    \ been through\n     the IETF process but has yet to see production deployment.\
    \  Should\n     it be, deployed, it will still face a many year transition period.\n\
    \   Prior to the availability of a larger address space, it seems prudent\n  \
    \ to consider opportunities for making more efficient use of the\n   existing\
    \ address space.\n   One such (small) opportunity is to change the way that point-to-point\n\
    \   links are numbered.  One option, which is used today on some parts of\n  \
    \ the Internet, is to simply not number point-to-point links between\n   routers.\
    \  While this practice may seem, at first, to handily resolve\n   the problem,\
    \ it causes a number of problems of its own, including the\n   inability to consistently\
    \ manage the unnumbered link or reach a\n   router through it, difficulty in management\
    \ and debugging of those\n   links, and the lack of standardization [RFC1812].\n\
    \   In current practice, numbered Internet subnets do not use longer than\n  \
    \ a 30-bit subnet mask (in most cases), which requires four addresses\n   per\
    \ link - two host addresses, one all-zeros network, and one all-\n   ones broadcast.\
    \  This is unfortunate for point-to-point links, since\n   they can only possibly\
    \ have two identifying endpoints and don't\n   support the notion of broadcast\
    \ - any packet which is transmitted by\n   one end of a link is always received\
    \ by the other.\n   A third option is to use host addresses on both ends of a\
    \ point-to-\n   point link.  This option provides the same address space savings\
    \ as\n   using a 31-bit subnet mask, but may only be used in links using PPP\n\
    \   encapsulation [RFC1332].  The use of host addresses allows for the\n   assignment\
    \ of IP addresses belonging to different networks at each\n   side of the link,\
    \ causing link and network management not to be\n   straight forward.\n   This\
    \ document is based on the idea that conserving IP addresses on\n   point-to-point\
    \ links (using longer than a 30-bit subnet mask) while\n   maintaining manageability\
    \ and standard interaction is possible.\n   Existing documentation [RFC950] has\
    \ already hinted at the possible\n   use of a 1-bit wide host-number field.\n\
    \   The savings in address space resulting from this change is easily\n   seen--each\
    \ point-to-point link in a large network would consume two\n   addresses instead\
    \ of four.  In a network with 500 point-to-point\n   links, for example, this\
    \ practice would amount to a savings of 1000\n   addresses (the equivalent of\
    \ four class C address spaces).\n"
- title: 2. Considerations of 31-Bit Prefixes
  contents:
  - "2. Considerations of 31-Bit Prefixes\n   This section discusses the possible\
    \ effects, on Internet routing and\n   operations, of using 31-bit prefixes on\
    \ point-to-point links.  The\n   considerations made here are also reflected in\
    \ Section 3.\n   For the length of this document, an IP address will be interpreted\n\
    \   as:\n        <Network-number><Host-number>\n   where the <Host-number> represents\
    \ the unmasked portion of the\n   address and it SHOULD be at least 1 bit wide.\
    \  The \"-1\" notation is\n   used to mean that the field has all 1 bits.  For\
    \ purposes of this\n   discussion, the routing system is considered capable of\
    \ classless, or\n   CIDR [RFC1519], routing.\n"
- title: 2.1. Addressing
  contents:
  - "2.1. Addressing\n   If a 31-bit subnet mask is assigned to a point-to-point link,\
    \ it\n   leaves the <Host-number> with only 1 bit.  Consequently, only two\n \
    \  possible addresses may result:\n        {<Network-number>, 0} and {<Network-number>,\
    \ -1}\n   These addresses have historically been associated with network and\n\
    \   broadcast addresses (see Section 2.2).  In a point-to-point link with\n  \
    \ a 31-bit subnet mask, the two addresses above MUST be interpreted as\n   host\
    \ addresses.\n"
- title: 2.2. Broadcast and Network Addresses
  contents:
  - "2.2. Broadcast and Network Addresses\n   There are several historically recognized\
    \ broadcast addresses\n   [RFC1812] on IP segments:\n      (a) the directed broadcast\n\
    \           {<Network-number>, -1}\n           {<Network-number>, 0}\n       \
    \  The network address itself {<Network-number>, 0} is an\n         obsolete form\
    \ of directed broadcast, but it may still be used\n         by older hosts.\n\
    \      (b) the link local (or limited) broadcast\n           {-1, -1}\n      \
    \     {0, 0}\n         The {0, 0} form of a limited broadcast is obsolete, but\
    \ may\n         still be present in a network.\n   Using a 31-bit prefix length\
    \ leaves only two numbering possibilities\n   (see Section 2.1), eliminating the\
    \ use of a directed broadcast to the\n   link (see Section 2.2.1).  The limited\
    \ broadcast MUST be used for all\n   broadcast traffic on a point-to-point link\
    \ with a 31-bit subnet mask\n   assigned to it.\n   The <Network-number> is assigned\
    \ by the network administrator as\n   unique to the local routing domain.  The\
    \ decision as to whether a\n   destination IP address should be a directed broadcast\
    \ or not is made\n   by the router directly connected to the destination segment.\
    \  Current\n   forwarding schemes and algorithms are not affected in remote routers.\n\
    \   The intent of this document is to discuss the applicability and\n   operation\
    \ of 31-bit prefixes on point-to-point links.  The effects\n   (if any) on other\
    \ types of interfaces are not considered.\n"
- title: 2.2.1. Directed Broadcast
  contents:
  - "2.2.1. Directed Broadcast\n   When a device wants to reach all the hosts on a\
    \ given (remote, rather\n   than directly connected) subnet, it may set the packet's\
    \ destination\n   address to the link's subnet broadcast address.  This operation\
    \ is\n   not possible for point-to-point links with a 31-bit prefix.\n   As discussed\
    \ in Section 6, the loss of functionality of a directed\n   broadcast may actually\
    \ be seen as a beneficial side effect, as it\n   slightly enhances the network's\
    \ resistance to a certain class of DoS\n   Attacks [RFC2644, SMURF].\n"
- title: 2.3. Impact on Current Routing Protocols
  contents:
  - "2.3. Impact on Current Routing Protocols\n   Networks with 31-bit prefixes have\
    \ no impact on current routing\n   protocols.  Most of the currently deployed\
    \ routing protocols have\n   been designed to provide classless routing.  Furthermore,\
    \ the\n   communication between peers is done using multicast, limited\n   broadcast\
    \ or unicast addresses (all on the local network), none of\n   which are affected\
    \ with the use of 31-bit subnet masks.\n"
