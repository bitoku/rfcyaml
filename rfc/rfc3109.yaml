- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The Internet design grew out of the pioneering packet-switched\n\
    \   network called the ARPAnet.  The ARPAnet was a mostly-US national\n   network\
    \ built of mini-computer packet switches, called Interface\n   Message Processors\
    \ (IMPs), that were linked by 56kbps leased\n   telephone lines.  The IMPs were\
    \ designed and built by Bolt, Beranek,\n   and Neumann (BBN) under contract with\
    \ ARPA, beginning in 1968.  One\n   of BBN's first tasks was to define the standard\
    \ hardware interface\n   between a host and a colocated IMP.  This interface was\
    \ described in\n   BBN Report 1822 [BBN1822], which was a bible for the administrators\n\
    \   of the many different hosts that connected to the ARPAnet.\n   The BBN Report\
    \ 1822 host/IMP hardware interface was bit-serial and\n   asynchronous.  In 1968,\
    \ the 8-bit byte had not yet been adopted as an\n   industry standard, so the\
    \ interface had to cope with word-based\n   machines with arbitrary word length\
    \ -- some common word lengths were\n   8, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 60, but there were\
    \ others.  From the software\n   viewpoint, Report 1822 defined what would today\
    \ be called the link-\n   layer access protocol for the ARPAnet.\n   In 1983 the\
    \ US DoD moved the ARPAnet technology to TCP/IP and split\n   off parts of the\
    \ ARPAnet to form a production facility called MILNET.\n   The DoD mandated a\
    \ byte-oriented, X.25-based interface for the MILNET\n   IMPs.  However, the machines\
    \ on the research-oriented ARPAnet\n   continued to use the 1822 interface under\
    \ the new Internet protocol\n   suite.  Therefore, BBN Report 1822 was made an\
    \ Internet Standard, STD\n   39, although the report was not republished as an\
    \ RFC.\n"
- title: 2. Action
  contents:
  - "2. Action\n   Since the ARPAnet technology and the BBN 1822 interface are no\
    \ longer\n   in use, the IESG is moving BBN Report 1822 from Standard to Historic\n\
    \   status.  The STD number 39 is retired.\n"
