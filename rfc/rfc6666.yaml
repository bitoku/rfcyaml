- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Remote Triggered Black Hole (RTBH) filtering describes a\
    \ class of\n   methods of blocking IP traffic either from a specific source\n\
    \   ([RFC5635]) or to a specific destination ([RFC3882]) on a network.\n   RTBH\
    \ routing describes a class of methods of re-routing IP traffic\n   destined to\
    \ the attacked/targeted host to a special path (tunnel)\n   where a sniffer could\
    \ capture the traffic for analysis.  Both of\n   these methods operate by setting\
    \ the next-hop address of an IP packet\n   with a specified source or destination\
    \ address to be a unicast prefix\n   that is connected locally or remotely to\
    \ a router's discard, null, or\n   tunnel interface.  Typically, reachability\
    \ information for this\n   prefix is propagated throughout an autonomous system\
    \ using a dynamic\n   routing protocol such as BGP ([RFC3882]).  By deploying\
    \ RTBH systems\n   across a network, traffic to or from specific destinations\
    \ may be\n   selectively black-holed or re-routed to a sinkhole device in a manner\n\
    \   that is efficient, scalable, and straightforward to implement.\n   On some\
    \ networks, operators configure RTBH installations using\n   [RFC1918] address\
    \ space or the address blocks reserved for\n   documentation in [RFC5737].  This\
    \ approach is inadequate because RTBH\n   configurations are not documentation,\
    \ but rather operationally\n   important features of many public-facing production\
    \ networks.\n   Furthermore, [RFC3849] specifies that the IPv6 documentation prefix\n\
    \   should be filtered in both local and public contexts.  On this basis,\n  \
    \ it is suggested that both private network address blocks and the\n   documentation\
    \ prefixes described in [RFC5737] are inappropriate for\n   RTBH configurations\
    \ and that a dedicated IPv6 prefix should be\n   assigned instead.\n   This document\
    \ updates the \"IPv6 Special Purpose Address Registry\"\n   [IANA-IPV6REG].\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Notational Conventions\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  A Discard Prefix for IPv6
  contents:
  - "2.  A Discard Prefix for IPv6\n   For the purposes of implementing an IPv6 RTBH\
    \ configuration, a\n   unicast address block is required.  There are currently\
    \ no IPv6\n   unicast address blocks that are specifically nominated for the\n\
    \   purposes of implementing such RTBH systems.\n   While it could be argued that\
    \ there are other addresses and address\n   prefixes that could be used for this\
    \ purpose (e.g., documentation\n   prefixes, private address space), or that an\
    \ operator could assign an\n   address block from their own address space for\
    \ this purpose, there is\n   currently no operational clarity on what address\
    \ block would be\n   appropriate or inappropriate to use for this purpose.  By\
    \ assigning a\n   globally unique discard prefix for IPv6, the IETF will introduce\
    \ good\n   practice for the implementation of IPv6 RTBH configurations and will\n\
    \   facilitate operational clarity by allowing operators to implement\n   consistent\
    \ and deterministic inter-domain prefix and traffic\n   filtering policies for\
    \ black-holed traffic.\n   As [RFC3882] and [RFC5635] describe situations where\
    \ more than one\n   discard address may be used for implementing multiple RTBH\
    \ scenarios,\n   a single address is not sufficient to cover all likely RTBH\n\
    \   situations.  Consequently, an address block is required.\n"
- title: 3.  Operational Implications
  contents:
  - "3.  Operational Implications\n   This assignment MAY be carried in a dynamic\
    \ routing protocol within\n   an autonomous system.  The assignment SHOULD NOT\
    \ be announced to or\n   accepted from third-party autonomous systems, and IPv6\
    \ traffic with a\n   destination address within this prefix SHOULD NOT be forwarded\
    \ to or\n   accepted from third-party autonomous systems.  If the prefix or a\n\
    \   subnet of the prefix is inadvertently announced to or accepted from a\n  \
    \ third-party autonomous system, this may cause excessive volumes of\n   traffic\
    \ to pass unintentionally between the two networks, which would\n   aggravate\
    \ the effect of a denial-of-service attack.\n   On networks that implement IPv6\
    \ remote triggered black holes, some or\n   all of this network block MAY be configured\
    \ with a next-hop\n   destination of a discard or null interface on any or all\
    \ IPv6 routers\n   within the autonomous system.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   Per this document, IANA has recorded the allocation\
    \ of the IPv6\n   address prefix 0100::/64 as a Discard-Only Prefix in the \"\
    Internet\n   Protocol Version 6 Address Space\" and added the prefix to the \"\
    IANA\n   IPv6 Special Purpose Address Registry\" [IANA-IPV6REG].  No end party\n\
    \   has been assigned to this prefix.  The prefix has been allocated from\n  \
    \ ::/3.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   As the prefix specified in this document ought\
    \ not normally be\n   transmitted or accepted over inter-domain BGP sessions for\
    \ the\n   reasons described in Section 3, it is usually appropriate to include\n\
    \   this prefix in inter-domain BGP prefix filters [RFC3704] or otherwise\n  \
    \ ensure the prefix is neither transmitted to nor accepted from a\n   third-party\
    \ autonomous system.\n"
