  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The serial digital interface, SMPTE 292M [1], defines a\
    \ universal\n   medium of interchange for uncompressed High Definition Television\n\
    \   (HDTV) between various types of video equipment (cameras, encoders,\n   VTRs,\
    \ etc.).  SMPTE 292M stipulates that the source data be in 10 bit\n   words and\
    \ the total data rate be either 1.485 Gbps or 1.485/1.001\n   Gbps.\n   The use\
    \ of a dedicated serial interconnect is appropriate in a studio\n   environment,\
    \ but it is desirable to leverage the widespread\n   availability of high bandwidth\
    \ IP connectivity to allow efficient\n   wide area delivery of SMPTE 292M content.\
    \  Accordingly, this memo\n   defines an RTP payload format for SMPTE 292M format\
    \ video.\n   It is to be noted that SMPTE 292M streams have a constant high bit\n\
    \   rate and are not congestion controlled.  Accordingly, use of this\n   payload\
    \ format should be tightly controlled and limited to private\n   networks or those\
    \ networks that provide resource reservation and\n   enhanced quality of service.\
    \  This is discussed further in section 9.\n   This memo only addresses the transfer\
    \ of uncompressed HDTV.\n   Compressed HDTV is a subset of MPEG-2 [9], which is\
    \ fully described\n   in document A/53 [10] of the Advanced Television Standards\
    \ Committee.\n   The ATSC has also adopted the MPEG-2 transport system (ISO/IEC\n\
    \   13818-1) [11].  Therefore RFC 2250 [12] sufficiently describes\n   transport\
    \ for compressed HDTV over RTP.\n"

  - "2.  Overview of SMPTE 292M\n   A SMPTE 292M television line comprises two interleaved\
    \ streams, one\n   containing the luminance (Y) samples, the other chrominance\
    \ (CrCb)\n   values.  Since chrominance is horizontally sub-sampled (4:2:2 coding)\n\
    \   the lengths of the two streams match (see Figure 3 of SMPTE 292M\n   [1]).\
    \  In addition to being the same length the streams also have\n   identical structures:\
    \ each stream is divided into four parts, (figure\n   1): (1) start of active\
    \ video timing reference (SAV); (2) digital\n   active line; (3) end of active\
    \ video timing reference (EAV); and (4)\n   digital line blanking.  A SMPTE 292M\
    \ line may also carry horizontal\n   ancillary data (H-ANC) or vertical ancillary\
    \ data (V-ANC) instead of\n   the blanking level; Likewise, ancillary data may\
    \ be transported\n   instead of a digital active line.\n   The EAV and SAV are\
    \ made up of three 10 bit words, with constant\n   values of 0x3FF 0x000 0x000\
    \ and an additional word (designated as XYZ\n   in figure 2), carrying a number\
    \ of flags.  This includes an F flag\n   which designates which field (1 or 2)\
    \ the line is transporting and\n   also a V flag which indicates field blanking.\
    \  Table 1, further\n   displays the code values in SAV and EAV.  After EAV, are\
    \ two words,\n   LN0 and LN1 (Table 2), that carry the 11 bit line number for\
    \ the\n   SMPTE 292M line.  The Cyclic Redundancy Check, CRC, is also a two\n\
    \   word value, shown as CR0 and CR1 in figure 2.\n      +------------+-----------------------+-----+---------------------+\n\

- title: 4.  Payload Design
  contents:
  - "4.  Payload Design\n   Each SMPTE 292M data line is packetized into one or more\
    \ RTP packets.\n   This includes all timing signals, blanking levels, active lines\n\
    \   and/or ancillary data.  Start of active video (SAV) and end of active\n  \
    \ video (EAV+LN+CRC) signals MUST NOT be fragmented across packets, as\n   the\
    \ SMPTE 292M decoder uses them to detect the start of scan lines.\n   The standard\
    \ RTP header is followed by a 4 octet payload header.  All\n   information in\
    \ the payload header pertains to the first data sample\n   in the packet.  The\
    \ end of a video frame (the packet containing the\n   last sample before the EAV)\
    \ is marked by the M bit in the RTP header.\n   The payload header contains a\
    \ 16 bit extension to the standard 16 bit\n   RTP sequence number, thereby extending\
    \ the sequence number to 32 bits\n   and enabling RTP to accommodate HDTV's high\
    \ data rates.  At 1.485\n   Gbps, with packet sizes of at least one thousand octets,\
    \ 32 bits\n   allows for an approximate 6 hour period before the sequence number\n\
    \   wraps around.  Given the same assumptions, the standard 16 bit RTP\n   sequence\
    \ number wraps around in less than a second (336\n   milliseconds), which is clearly\
    \ not sufficient for the purpose of\n   detecting loss and out of order packets.\n\
    \   A 148.5 MHz (or 148.5/1.001 MHz) time-stamp is used as the RTP\n   timestamp.\
    \  This allows the receiver to reconstruct the timing of the\n   SMPTE 292M stream,\
    \ without knowledge of the exact type of source\n   format (e.g., SMPTE 274M or\
    \ SMPTE 296M).  With this timestamp, the\n   location of the first sample of each\
    \ packet can be uniquely\n   identified in the SMPTE 292M stream.  At 148.5 MHz,\
    \ the 32 bit\n   timestamp wraps around in 21 seconds.\n   The payload header\
    \ also carries the 11 bit line number from the SMPTE\n   292M timing signals.\
    \  This provides more information at the\n   application level and adds a level\
    \ of resiliency, in case the packet\n   containing the EAV is lost.\n   The bit\
    \ length of both timing signals, SAV and EAV+LN+CRC, are\n   multiples of 8 bits,\
    \ 40 bits and 80 bits, respectively, and therefore\n   are naturally octet aligned.\n\
    \   For the video content, it is desirable for the video to both octet\n   align\
    \ when packetized and also adhere to the principles of\n   application level framing,\
    \ also known as ALF [13].  For YCrCb video,\n   the ALF principle translates into\
    \ not fragmenting related luminance\n   and chrominance values across packets.\
    \  For example, with the 4:2:0\n   color subsampling, a 4 pixel group is represented\
    \ by 6 values, Y1 Y2\n   Y3 Y4 Cr Cb, and video content should be packetized such\
    \ that these\n   values are not fragmented across 2 packets.  However, with 10\
    \ bit\n   words, this is a 60 bit value which is not octet aligned.  To be both\n\
    \   octet aligned, and adhere to ALF, an ALF unit must represent 2 groups\n  \
    \ of 4 Pixels, thereby becoming octet aligned on a 15 octet boundary.\n   This\
    \ length is referred to as the pixel group or pgroup, and it is\n   conveyed in\
    \ the SDP parameters.  Table 3 displays the pgroup value\n   for various color\
    \ samplings.  Typical source formats use 4:2:2\n   sampling, and require a pgroup\
    \ of 5 octets, other values are included\n   for completeness.\n   The contents\
    \ of the Digital Active Line SHOULD NOT be fragmented\n   within a pgroup.  A\
    \ pgroup of 1 indicates that data may be split at\n   any octet boundary (this\
    \ is applicable to instances where the source\n   format is not known).  The SAV\
    \ and EAV+LN+CRC fields MUST NOT be\n   fragmented.\n         +-------------------------------------------------------+\n\

    \   Considering the high data rate of this payload format, the minimum\n   interval\

- title: 8.  Mapping to SDP Parameters

  - "8.  Mapping to SDP Parameters\n   Parameters are mapped to SDP [14] as follows:\n\
    \      m=video 30000 RTP/AVP 111\n      a=rtpmap:111 SMPTE292M/148500000\n   \
    \   a=fmtp:111  pgroup=5\n   In this example, a dynamic payload type 111 is used\
    \ for SMPTE292M.\n   The RTP timestamp is 148500000 Hz and the SDP parameter pgroup\n\
    \   indicates that for video data after the SAV signal, it must be\n   packetized\
    \ in multiples of 5 octets.\n"
- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   RTP sessions using the payload format defined\
    \ in this specification\n   are subject to the security considerations discussed\
    \ in the RTP\n   specification [3] and any appropriate RTP profile (e.g., [4]).\n\
    \   This payload format does not exhibit any significant non-uniformity\n   in\
    \ the receiver side computational complexity for packet processing\n   to cause\
    \ a potential denial-of-service threat for intended receivers.\n   The bandwidth\
    \ of this payload format is high enough (1.485 Gbps\n   without the RTP overhead)\
    \ to cause potential for denial-of-service if\n   transmitted onto most currently\
    \ available Internet paths.  Since\n   congestion control is not possible for\
    \ SMPTE 292M over RTP flows, use\n   of the payload SHOULD be narrowly limited\
    \ to suitably connected\n   network endpoints, or to networks where QoS guarantees\
    \ are available.\n   If QoS enhanced service is used, RTP receivers SHOULD monitor\
    \ packet\n   loss to ensure that the service that was requested is actually being\n\
    \   delivered.  If it is not, then they SHOULD assume that they are\n   receiving\
    \ best-effort service and behave accordingly.\n   If best-effort service is being\
    \ used, RTP receivers MUST monitor\n   packet loss to ensure that the packet loss\
    \ rate is within acceptable\n   parameters and MUST leave the session if the loss\
    \ rate is too high.\n   The loss rate is considered acceptable if a TCP flow across\
    \ the same\n   network path, experiencing the same network conditions, would achieve\n\
    \   an average throughput, measured on a reasonable timescale, that is\n   not\
    \ less than the RTP flow is achieving.  Since congestion control is\n   not possible\
    \ for SMPTE 292M flows, this condition can only be\n   satisfied if receivers\
    \ leave the session if the loss rate is\n   unacceptably high.\n"
