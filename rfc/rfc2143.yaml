  - "1.  Introduction\n   As the capacity of local area networks increases to meet\
    \ the demands\n   of high volume application data, there is a class of network\n\
    \   intensive problems which may be applied to small clusters of\n   workstations\
    \ with high bandwidth interconnection.\n   A general observation of networks is\
    \ that the bit rate of the data\n   path typically decreases as the distance between\
    \ hosts increases.  It\n   is common to see regional networks connected at a rate\
    \ of 64Kbps and\n   office networks connected at 100Mbps, but the inverse is far\
    \ less\n   common.\n   The same is true of peripheral and memory interconnection.\
    \  Memory\n   close to a CPU's core may run at speeds equivalent to a gigabit\n\
    \   network.  More importantly, devices such as disks may connect a\n   number\
    \ of metres away from its host at speeds well in excess of\n   current local area\
    \ network capacity.\n   This document outlines a protocol for connecting hosts\
    \ running the\n   TCP/IP protocol suite over a Small Computer System Interface\
    \ (SCSI)\n   bus.  Despite the limitation in the furthest distance between hosts,\n\
    \   SCSI permits close clusters of workstations to communicate between\n   each\
    \ other at speeds approaching 360 megabits per second.\n   The proposed introduction\
    \ of newer SCSI implementations such as\n   serial SCSI will bring much faster\
    \ communication at greater\n   distances.\n"

  - "2.  Background to the Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)\n   SCSI defines\
    \ a physical and data link protocol for connecting\n   peripherals to hosts. \
    \ Devices connect autonomously to a bus and send\n   synchronous or asynchronous\
    \ messages to other devices.\n   Devices are identified by a numeric identifier\
    \ (ID).  For the\n   original SCSI protocol, devices are given a user-selectable\
    \ SCSI ID\n   between 0 and 7.  Wide SCSI specifies a range of SCSI IDs between\
    \ 0\n   and 15.  The most typical SCSI configuration comprises of a host\n   adapter\
    \ and one or more SCSI- capable peripherals responding to\n   asynchronous messages\
    \ from the host adapter.\n   The most critical aspect of the protocol with respect\
    \ to its use as a\n   data link for the Internet protocols is that a SCSI device\
    \ must act\n   as an \"initiator\" (generator of SCSI commands/requests) or a\
    \ \"target\"\n   (a device which responds to SCSI commands from the initiator).\
    \  This\n   model is correct for a master/slave relationship between host adapter\n\
    \   and devices.  The only time an initiator receives a message addressed\n  \
    \ to it is in response to a command issued by it in the past and a\n   target\
    \ device always generates a response to every command it\n   receives.\n   Clearly\
    \ this is unsuitable for the peer-to-peer model required for\n   multiple host\
    \ adapters to asynchronously send SCSI commands to one\n   another without surplus\
    \ bus traffic.  Furthermore, some host adapters\n   may refuse to accept a message\
    \ from another adapter as it expects to\n   only initiate SCSI commands.  This\
    \ restriction to the protocol\n   requires that SCSI adapters used for IP encapsulation\
    \ support what is\n   known as \"target mode\", with software device driver support\
    \ to pass\n   these messages up to higher layer modules for processing.\n"
- title: 3.  Link Encapsulation
  contents:
  - "3.  Link Encapsulation\n   The ANSI SCSI standard defines classes of peripherals\
    \ which may be\n   interconnected with the SCSI protocol.  One of these is the\
    \ class of\n   \"communication devices\" [1].\n   The standard defines three message\
    \ types capable of carrying a\n   general-purpose payload across communication\
    \ devices.  Each of these\n   are known as the \"SEND MESSAGE\" message type,\
    \ but the size and and\n   structure of the message header differs amongst them.\
    \  The three\n   forms of message header are six (6), ten (10) and twelve (12)\
    \ bytes\n   long.\n   It was decided that the ten byte header offers the greatest\n\
    \   flexibility for encapsulating version 4 IP datagrams for the\n   following\
    \ reasons:\n      a. The transfer length field is 16 bits in size which is perfectly\n\
    \         matched to the datagram length field in IP version 4.\n         Implementations\
    \ of IP will run efficiently as datagrams will\n         never be fragmented over\
    \ SCSI networks.\n      b. The SCSI \"stream select\" field, which was designed\
    \ to permit\n         a device to specify the stream of data to which a block\n\
    \         belongs, may be used to encode the payload type (in a similar\n    \
    \     manner to the Ethernet frame type field).  For consistency, the\n      \
    \   lowest four bits of the \"stream select\" field should match the\n       \
    \  set of values assigned by the IEEE for Ethernet protocol types.\n   Encapsulating\
    \ an IP datagram within a SCSI message is\n   straightforward:\n      +------------------+-----------------------------------+\n\
    \      | SCSI header      | IP datagram                       |\n      +------------------+-----------------------------------+\n\
    \   The fields of the SCSI header should be completed as follows:\n        Byte\
    \  0:    0x2A (SEND_MESSAGE(10) opcode)\n        Byte  1:    Logical unit number\
    \ encoded into top 3 bits | 0x00\n        Byte  2:    0x00\n        Byte  3: \
    \   0x00\n        Byte  4:    0x00\n        Byte  5:    Protocol type encoded\
    \ into lowest 4 bits | 0x00\n        Byte  6:    0x00\n        Bytes 7/8:  IP\
    \ datagram length, big endian representation\n        Byte  9:    0x00\n"
- title: 4.  An Address Resolution Protocol
  contents:
  - "4.  An Address Resolution Protocol\n   When IP decides that the next hop for\
    \ a datagram will be onto a SCSI\n   network supported by a SCSI IP network interface\
    \ implementation, it\n   is necessary to acquire a data link address to deliver\
    \ the datagram.\n   Network interfaces such as Ethernet have well-known methods\
    \ for\n   acquiring the media address for an Internet protocol address, the\n\
    \   most common being the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).  In existing\n  \
    \ implementations, the forwarding host \"yells\" using a broadcast media\n   address\
    \ and expects the named host to respond.\n   The SCSI protocol does not provide\
    \ a broadcast data link address.  An\n   acceptable solution to the address resolution\
    \ problem for a SCSI\n   network is to simulate a broadcast by performing a series\
    \ of round-\n   robin transmissions to each target.  Depending on the SCSI protocol\n\
    \   being used, this would require upward of seven independent bus\n   accesses.\
    \  This is not grossly inefficient, however, if combined with\n   an effective\
    \ ARP caching policy.  A further possible optimisation is\n   negative ARP caching,\
    \ whereby incomplete ARP bindings are not queried\n   for some period in the future.\n"
- title: 5.  Scalability
  contents:
  - "5.  Scalability\n   While the utility of a network architecture based around\
    \ a bus\n   network which can span less than ten metres and support only eight\n\
    \   hosts may be questionable, the flexibility of IP and in particular,\n   IP\
    \ routing, improves the scalability of this architecture.\n   Consider a network\
    \ of eight hosts connected to a SCSI bus in which\n   each host acts as a multi-homed\
    \ host with a second host adapter\n   connecting another seven hosts to it.  When\
    \ configured with IP packet\n   routing capability, each of the 64 total hosts\
    \ may communicate with\n   one another at high speed in a packet switched manner.\n\
    \   Depending on the I/O bus capabilities of certain workstations, it may\n  \
    \ also be possible to configure a multi-homed host with a greater\n   number of\
    \ SCSI host adapters, permitting centralised star\n   configurations to be constructed.\n\
    \   It should be apparent that for little expense, massively parallel\n   virtual\
    \ machines can be built based upon the IP protocol running over\n   the high-bandwidth\
    \ SCSI protocol.\n"
- title: 6.  Possible Applications
  contents:
  - "6.  Possible Applications\n   Research has been made into the capability of \"\
    networks of\n   workstations\", and their performance compared to supercomputers.\
    \  An\n   observation that has been made thus far is that bottlenecks exist in\n\
    \   the channels by which executable code is transported between hosts\n   for\
    \ execution.  A very high-speed network architecture based around\n   the Internet\
    \ protocol would permit a seamless transition of existing\n   application software\
    \ to a high-bandwidth environment.\n   Other applications that have been considered\
    \ are server clusters for\n   fault-tolerant NFS, World-Wide Web and database\
    \ services.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Transmitting IP datagrams across a SCSI bus raises\
    \ similar security\n   issues to other local area networking architectures.  The\
    \ scale of\n   security problems relating to protocols above the data link layer\n\
    \   should be obvious to a reader current in Internet security.\n"
