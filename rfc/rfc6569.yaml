- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes a process for work in the IETF codec\
    \ WG on\n   standardization of an audio codec that is optimized for use in\n \
    \  interactive Internet applications and that can be widely implemented\n   and\
    \ easily distributed among application developers, service\n   operators, and\
    \ end users.\n"
- title: 2.  Development Process
  contents:
  - "2.  Development Process\n   The process outlined here is intended to make the\
    \ work on a codec\n   within the IETF transparent, predictable, and well organized,\
    \ in a\n   way that is consistent with [PROCESS].  Such work might involve\n \
    \  development of a completely new codec, adaptation of an existing\n   codec\
    \ to meet the requirements of the working group, or integration\n   of two or\
    \ more existing codecs that results in an improved codec\n   combining the best\
    \ aspects of each.  To enable such procedural\n   transparency, the contributor\
    \ of an existing codec must be willing to\n   cede change control to the IETF\
    \ and should have sufficient knowledge\n   of the codec to assist in the work\
    \ of adapting it or applying some of\n   its technology to the development or\
    \ improvement of other codecs.\n   Furthermore, contributors need to be aware\
    \ that any codec that\n   results from work within the IETF is likely to be different\
    \ from any\n   existing codec that was contributed to the Internet Standards\n\
    \   Process.\n   Work on developing an interactive audio codec is expected to\
    \ proceed\n   as follows:\n   1.  IETF participants will identify the requirements\
    \ to be met by an\n       Internet codec in the form of an Internet-Draft.\n \
    \  2.  Interested parties are encouraged to make contributions proposing\n   \
    \    existing or new codecs, or elements thereof, to the codec WG as\n       long\
    \ as these contributions are within the scope of the WG.\n       Ideally, these\
    \ contributions should be in the form of Internet-\n       Drafts, although other\
    \ forms of contributions are also possible,\n       as discussed in [PROCESS].\n\
    \   3.  Given the importance of intellectual property rights (IPR) to the\n  \
    \     activities of the working group, any IPR disclosures must be made\n    \
    \   in a timely way.  Contributors are required, as described in\n       [IPR],\
    \ to disclose any known IPR, both first and third party.\n       Timely disclosures\
    \ are particularly important, since those\n       disclosures may be material\
    \ to the decision process of the\n       working group.\n   4.  As contributions\
    \ are received and discussed within the working\n       group, the group should\
    \ gain a clearer understanding of what is\n       achievable within the design\
    \ space.  As a result, the authors of\n       the requirements document should\
    \ iteratively clarify and improve\n       their document to reflect the emerging\
    \ working group consensus.\n       This is likely to involve collaboration with\
    \ IETF working groups\n       in other areas, such as collaboration with working\
    \ groups in the\n       Transport area to identify important aspects of packet\n\
    \       transmission over the Internet and to understand the degree of\n     \
    \  rate adaptation desirable and with working groups in the RAI area\n       to\
    \ ensure that information about and negotiation of the codec can\n       be easily\
    \ represented at the signaling layer.  In parallel with\n       this work, interested\
    \ parties should evaluate the contributions\n       at a higher level to see which\
    \ requirements might be met by each\n       codec.\n   5.  Once a sufficient number\
    \ of proposals has been received, the\n       interested parties will identify\
    \ the strengths, weaknesses, and\n       innovative aspects of the contributed\
    \ codecs.  This step will\n       consider not only the codecs as a whole, but\
    \ also key features of\n       the individual algorithms (predictors, quantizers,\
    \ transforms,\n       etc.).\n   6.  Interested parties are encouraged to collaborate\
    \ and combine the\n       best ideas from the various codec contributions into\
    \ a\n       consolidated codec definition, representing the merging of some\n\
    \       of the contributions.  Through this iterative process, the number\n  \
    \     of proposals will reduce, and consensus will generally form\n       around\
    \ one of them.  At that point, the working group should\n       adopt that document\
    \ as a working group item, forming a baseline\n       codec.\n   7.  IETF participants\
    \ should then attempt to iteratively add to or\n       improve each component\
    \ of the baseline codec reference\n       implementation, where by \"component\"\
    \ we mean individual\n       algorithms such as predictors, transforms, quantizers,\
    \ and\n       entropy coders.  The participants should proceed by trying new\n\
    \       designs, applying ideas from the contributed codecs, evaluating\n    \
    \   \"proof of concept\" ideas, and using their expertise in codec\n       development\
    \ to improve the baseline codec.  Any aspect of the\n       baseline codec might\
    \ be changed (even the fundamental principles\n       of the codec), or the participants\
    \ might start over entirely by\n       scrapping the baseline codec and designing\
    \ a completely new one.\n       The overriding goal shall be to design a codec\
    \ that will meet the\n       requirements defined in the requirements document\
    \ [CODEC-REQ].\n       Given the IETF's open standards process, any interested\
    \ party\n       will be able to contribute to this work, whether or not they\n\
    \       submitted an Internet-Draft for one of the contributed codecs.\n     \
    \  The codec itself should be normatively specified with code in an\n       Internet-Draft.\n\
    \   8.  In parallel with work on the codec reference implementation,\n       developers\
    \ and other interested parties should perform evaluation\n       of the codec\
    \ as described under Section 3.  IETF participants\n       should define (within\
    \ the PAYLOAD working group) the codec's\n       payload format for use with the\
    \ Real-time Transport Protocol\n       [RTP].  Ideally, application developers\
    \ should test the codec by\n       implementing it in code and deploying it in\
    \ actual Internet\n       applications.  Unfortunately, developers will frequently\
    \ wait to\n       deploy the codec until it is published as an RFC or until a\n\
    \       stable bitstream is guaranteed.  As such, this is a nice-to-have\n   \
    \    and not a requirement for this process.  Lab implementations are\n      \
    \ certainly encouraged.\n   9.  The group will produce a testing results document.\
    \  The document\n       will be a living document that captures testing done before\
    \ the\n       codec stabilized, after it has stabilized, and after the codec\n\
    \       specification is issued as an RFC.  The document serves the\n       purpose\
    \ of helping the group determine whether the codec meets\n       the requirements.\
    \  Any testing done after the codec RFC is issued\n       helps implementers understand\
    \ the final performance of the codec.\n       The process of testing is described\
    \ in Section 3.\n"
- title: 3.  Evaluation, Testing, and Characterization
  contents:
  - "3.  Evaluation, Testing, and Characterization\n   Lab evaluation of the codec\
    \ being developed should happen throughout\n   the development process because\
    \ it will help ensure that progress is\n   being made toward fulfillment of the\
    \ requirements.  There are many\n   ways in which continuous evaluation can be\
    \ performed.  For minor,\n   uncontroversial changes to the codec, it should usually\
    \ be sufficient\n   to use objective measurements (e.g., Perceptual Evaluation\
    \ of Speech\n   Quality (PESQ) [ITU-T-P.862], Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality\n\
    \   (PEAQ) [ITU-R-BS.1387-1], and segmental signal-to-noise ratio)\n   validated\
    \ by informal subjective evaluation.  For more complex\n   changes (e.g., when\
    \ psychoacoustic aspects are involved) or for\n   controversial issues, internal\
    \ testing should be performed.  An\n   example of internal testing would be to\
    \ have individual participants\n   rate the decoded samples using one of the established\
    \ testing\n   methodologies, such as MUltiple Stimuli with Hidden Reference and\n\
    \   Anchor (MUSHRA) [ITU-R-BS.1534].\n   Throughout the process, it will be important\
    \ to make use of the\n   Internet community at large for real-world distributed\
    \ testing.  This\n   will enable many different people with different equipment\
    \ and use\n   cases to test the codec and report any problems they experience.\
    \  In\n   the same way, third-party developers will be encouraged to integrate\n\
    \   the codec into their software (with a warning about the bitstream not\n  \
    \ being final) and provide feedback on its performance in real-world\n   use cases.\n\
    \   Characterization of the final codec must be based on the reference\n   implementation\
    \ only (and not on any \"private implementation\").  This\n   can be performed\
    \ by independent testing labs or, if this is not\n   possible, by testing labs\
    \ of the organizations that contribute to the\n   Internet Standards Process.\
    \  Packet-loss robustness should be\n   evaluated using actual loss patterns collected\
    \ from use over the\n   Internet, rather than theoretical models.  The goals of\
    \ the\n   characterization phase are to:\n   o  ensure that the requirements have\
    \ been fulfilled\n   o  guide the IESG in its evaluation of the resulting work\n\
    \   o  assist application developers in understanding whether the codec\n    \
    \  is suitable for a particular application\n   The exact methodology for the\
    \ characterization phase can be\n   determined by the working group.  Because\
    \ the IETF does not have\n   testing resources of its own, it has to rely on the\
    \ resources of its\n   participants.  For this reason, even if the group agrees\
    \ that a\n   particular test is important, if no one volunteers to do it, or if\n\
    \   volunteers do not complete it in a timely fashion, then that test\n   should\
    \ be discarded.  This ensures that only important tests be done\n   -- in particular,\
    \ the tests that are important to participants.\n"
- title: 4.  Specifying the Codec
  contents:
  - "4.  Specifying the Codec\n   Specifying a codec requires careful consideration\
    \ regarding what is\n   required versus what is left to the implementation.  The\
    \ following\n   text provides guidelines for consideration by the working group:\n\
    \   1.  Any audio codec specified by the codec working group must include\n  \
    \     source code for a normative software implementation, documented\n      \
    \ in an Internet-Draft intended for publication as a Standards\n       Track RFC.\
    \  This implementation will be used to verify\n       conformance of an implementation.\
    \  Although a text description of\n       the algorithm should be provided, its\
    \ use should be limited to\n       helping the reader in understanding the source\
    \ code.  Should the\n       description contradict the source code, the latter\
    \ shall take\n       precedence.  For convenience, the source code may be provided\
    \ in\n       compressed form, with base64 [BASE64] encoding.\n   2.  Because of\
    \ the size and complexity of most codecs, it is possible\n       that even after\
    \ publishing the RFC, bugs will be found in the\n       reference implementation,\
    \ or differences will be found between\n       the implementation and the text\
    \ description.  As usual, an errata\n       list should be maintained for the\
    \ RFC.  Although a public\n       software repository containing the current reference\n\
    \       implementation is desirable, the normative implementation would\n    \
    \   still be the RFC.\n   3.  It is the intention of the group to allow the greatest\
    \ possible\n       choice of freedom in implementing the specification.\n    \
    \   Accordingly, the number of binding RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS] keywords\n       will\
    \ be the minimum that still allows interoperable\n       implementations.  In\
    \ practice, this generally means that only the\n       decoder needs to be normative,\
    \ so that the encoder can improve\n       over time.  This also enables different\
    \ trade-offs between\n       quality and complexity.\n   4.  To reduce the risk\
    \ of bias towards certain CPU/DSP (central\n       processing unit / digital signal\
    \ processor) architectures,\n       ideally the decoder specification should not\
    \ require \"bit-exact\"\n       conformance with the reference implementation.\
    \  In that case, the\n       output of a decoder implementation should only be\
    \ \"close enough\"\n       to the output of the reference decoder, and a comparison\
    \ tool\n       should be provided along with the codec to verify objectively\n\
    \       that the output of a decoder is likely to be perceptually\n       indistinguishable\
    \ from that of the reference decoder.  An\n       implementation may still wish\
    \ to produce an output that is bit-\n       exact with the reference implementation\
    \ to simplify the testing\n       procedure.\n   5.  To ensure freedom of implementation,\
    \ decoder-side-only error\n       concealment does not need to be specified, although\
    \ the reference\n       implementation should include the same packet-loss concealment\n\
    \       (PLC) algorithm as used in the testing phase.  Is it up to the\n     \
    \  working group to decide whether minimum requirements on PLC\n       quality\
    \ will be required for compliance with the specification.\n       Obviously, any\
    \ information signaled in the bitstream intended to\n       aid PLC needs to be\
    \ specified.\n   6.  An encoder implementation should not be required to make\
    \ use of\n       all the \"features\" (tools) in the bitstream definition.  However,\n\
    \       the codec specification may require that an encoder\n       implementation\
    \ be able to generate any possible bitrate.  Unless\n       a particular \"profile\"\
    \ is defined in the specification, the\n       decoder must be able to decode\
    \ all features of the bitstream.\n       The decoder must also be able to handle\
    \ any combination of bits,\n       even combinations that cannot be generated\
    \ by the reference\n       encoder.  It is recommended that the decoder specification\
    \ shall\n       define how the decoder should react to \"impossible\" packets\n\
    \       (e.g., reject or consider as valid).  However, an encoder must\n     \
    \  never generate packets that do not conform to the bitstream\n       definition.\n\
    \   7.  Compressed test vectors should be provided as a means to verify\n    \
    \   conformance with the decoder specification.  These test vectors\n       should\
    \ be designed to exercise as much of the decoder code as\n       possible.\n \
    \  8.  While the exact encoder will not be specified, it is recommended\n    \
    \   to specify objective measurement targets for an encoder, below\n       which\
    \ use of a particular encoder implementation is not\n       recommended.  For\
    \ example, one such specification could be: \"the\n       use of an encoder whose\
    \ PESQ mean opinion score (MOS) is better\n       than 0.1 below the reference\
    \ encoder in the following conditions\n       is not recommended\".\n"
- title: 5.  Intellectual Property
  contents:
  - "5.  Intellectual Property\n   Producing an unencumbered codec is desirable for\
    \ the following\n   reasons:\n   o  It is the experience of a wide variety of\
    \ application developers\n      and service providers that encumbrances such as\
    \ licensing and\n      royalties make it difficult to implement, deploy, and distribute\n\
    \      multimedia applications for use by the Internet community.\n   o  It is\
    \ beneficial to have low-cost options whenever possible,\n      because innovation\
    \ -- the hallmark of the Internet -- is hampered\n      when small development\
    \ teams cannot deploy an application because\n      of usage-based licensing fees\
    \ and royalties.\n   o  Many market segments are moving away from selling hard-coded\n\
    \      hardware devices and toward freely distributing end-user software;\n  \
    \    this is true of numerous large application providers and even\n      telcos\
    \ themselves.\n   o  Compatibility with the licensing of typical open source\n\
    \      applications implies the need to avoid encumbrances, including\n      even\
    \ the requirement to obtain a license for implementation,\n      deployment, or\
    \ use (even if the license does not require the\n      payment of a fee).\n  \
    \ Therefore, a codec that can be widely implemented and easily\n   distributed\
    \ among application developers, service operators, and end\n   users is preferred.\
    \  Many existing codecs that might fulfill some or\n   most of the technical attributes\
    \ listed above are encumbered in\n   various ways.  For example, patent holders\
    \ might require that those\n   wishing to implement the codec in software, deploy\
    \ the codec in a\n   service, or distribute the codec in software or hardware\
    \ need to\n   request a license, enter into a business agreement, pay licensing\n\
    \   fees or royalties, or adhere to other special conditions or\n   restrictions.\
    \  Because such encumbrances have made it difficult to\n   widely implement and\
    \ easily distribute high-quality codecs across the\n   entire Internet community,\
    \ the working group prefers unencumbered\n   technologies in a way that is consistent\
    \ with BCP 78 [IPR] and BCP 79\n   [TRUST].  In particular, the working group\
    \ shall heed the preference\n   stated in BCP 79: \"In general, IETF working groups\
    \ prefer\n   technologies with no known IPR claims or, for technologies with\n\
    \   claims against them, an offer of royalty-free licensing.\"  Although\n   this\
    \ preference cannot guarantee that the working group will produce\n   an unencumbered\
    \ codec, the working group shall follow and adhere to\n   the spirit of BCP 79.\
    \  The working group cannot explicitly rule out\n   the possibility of adopting\
    \ encumbered technologies; however, the\n   working group will try to avoid encumbered\
    \ technologies that require\n   royalties or other encumbrances that would prevent\
    \ such technologies\n   from being easy to redistribute and use.\n   When considering\
    \ license terms for technologies with IPR claims\n   against them, some members\
    \ of the working group have expressed their\n   preference for license terms that:\n\
    \   o  are available to all, worldwide, whether or not they are working\n    \
    \  group participants\n   o  extend to all essential claims owned or controlled\
    \ by the licensor\n   o  do not require payment of royalties, fees, or other consideration\n\
    \   o  do not require licensees to adhere to restrictions on usage\n      (though,\
    \ licenses that apply only to implementation of the\n      standard are acceptable)\n\
    \   o  do not otherwise impede the ability of the codec to be implemented\n  \
    \    in open-source software projects\n   The following guidelines will help to\
    \ maximize the odds that the\n   codec will be unencumbered:\n   1.  In accordance\
    \ with BCP 79 [IPR], contributed codecs should\n       preferably use technologies\
    \ with no known IPR claims or\n       technologies with an offer of royalty-free\
    \ licensing.\n   2.  As described in BCP 79, the working group should use technologies\n\
    \       that are perceived by the participants to be safer with regard to\n  \
    \     IPR issues.\n   3.  Contributors must disclose IPR as specified in BCP 79.\n\
    \   4.  In cases where no royalty-free license can be obtained regarding\n   \
    \    a patent, BCP 79 suggests that the working group consider\n       alternative\
    \ algorithms or methods, even if they result in lower\n       quality, higher\
    \ complexity, or otherwise less desirable\n       characteristics.\n   5.  In\
    \ accordance with BCP 78 [TRUST], the source code for the\n       reference implementation\
    \ must be made available under a BSD-style\n       license (or whatever license\
    \ is defined as acceptable by the IETF\n       Trust when the Internet-Draft defining\
    \ the reference\n       implementation is published).\n   Many IPR licenses specify\
    \ that a license is granted only for\n   technologies that are adopted by the\
    \ IETF as a standard.  While\n   reasonable, this has the unintended side effect\
    \ of discouraging\n   implementation prior to RFC status.  Real-world implementation\
    \ is\n   beneficial for evaluation of the codec.  As such, entities making IPR\n\
    \   license statements are encouraged to use wording that permits early\n   implementation\
    \ and deployment.\n   IETF participants should be aware that, given the way patents\
    \ work in\n   most countries, the resulting codec can never be guaranteed to be\n\
    \   free of patent claims because some patents may not be known to the\n   contributors,\
    \ some patent applications may not be disclosed at the\n   time the codec is developed,\
    \ and only courts of law can determine the\n   validity and breadth of patent\
    \ claims.  However, these observations\n   are no different within the Internet\
    \ Standards Process than they are\n   for standardization of codecs within other\
    \ Standards Development\n   Organizations (SDOs) (or development of codecs outside\
    \ the context of\n   any SDO); furthermore, they are no different for codecs than\
    \ for\n   other technologies worked on within the IETF.  In all these cases,\n\
    \   the best approach is to minimize the risk of unknowingly incurring\n   encumbrance\
    \ on existing patents.  Despite these precautions,\n   participants need to understand\
    \ that, practically speaking, it is\n   nearly impossible to _guarantee_ that\
    \ implementers will not incur\n   encumbrance on existing patents.\n"
- title: 6.  Relationship with Other SDOs
  contents:
  - "6.  Relationship with Other SDOs\n   It is understood that other SDOs are also\
    \ involved in the codec\n   development and standardization, including but not\
    \ necessarily\n   limited to:\n   o  The Telecommunication Standardization Sector\
    \ (ITU-T) of the\n      International Telecommunication Union (ITU), in particular\
    \ Study\n      Group 16\n   o  The Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) of the\
    \ International\n      Organization for Standardization and International\n  \
    \    Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC)\n   o  The European Telecommunications\
    \ Standards Institute (ETSI)\n   o  The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)\n\
    \   o  The 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2)\n   It is important to\
    \ ensure that such work does not constitute\n   uncoordinated protocol development\
    \ of the kind described in [UNCOORD]\n   in the following principle:\n      [T]he\
    \ IAB considers it an essential principle of the protocol\n      development process\
    \ that only one SDO maintains design authority\n      for a given protocol, with\
    \ that SDO having ultimate authority over\n      the allocation of protocol parameter\
    \ code-points and over defining\n      the intended semantics, interpretation,\
    \ and actions associated\n      with those code-points.\n   The work envisioned\
    \ by this guidelines document is not uncoordinated\n   in the sense described\
    \ in the foregoing quote, since the intention of\n   this process is that two\
    \ possible outcomes might occur:\n   1.  The IETF adopts an existing audio codec\
    \ and specifies that it is\n       the \"anointed\" IETF Internet codec.  In such\
    \ a case, codec\n       ownership lies entirely with the SDO that produced the\
    \ codec, and\n       not with the IETF.\n   2.  The IETF produces a new codec.\
    \  Even if this codec uses concepts,\n       algorithms, or even source code from\
    \ a codec produced by another\n       SDO, the IETF codec is a specification unto\
    \ itself and under\n       complete control of the IETF.  Any changes or enhancements\
    \ made\n       by the original SDO to the codecs whose components the IETF used\n\
    \       are not applicable to the IETF codec.  Such changes would be\n       incorporated\
    \ as a consequence of a revision or extension of the\n       IETF RFC.  In no\
    \ case should the new codec reuse a name or code\n       point from another SDO.\n\
    \   Although there is already sufficient codec expertise available among\n   IETF\
    \ participants to complete the envisioned work, additional\n   contributions are\
    \ welcome within the framework of the Internet\n   Standards Process in the following\
    \ ways:\n   o  Individuals who are technical contributors to codec work within\n\
    \      other SDOs can participate directly in codec work within the IETF.\n  \
    \ o  Other SDOs can contribute their expertise (e.g., codec\n      characterization\
    \ and evaluation techniques) and thus facilitate\n      the testing of a codec\
    \ produced by the IETF.\n   o  Any SDO can provide input to IETF work through\
    \ liaison statements.\n   However, it is important to note that final responsibility\
    \ for the\n   development process and the resulting codec will remain with the\
    \ IETF\n   as governed by BCP 9 [PROCESS].\n   Finally, there is precedent for\
    \ the contribution of codecs developed\n   elsewhere to the ITU-T (e.g., Adaptive\
    \ Multi-Rate Wideband (AMR-WB)\n   was standardized originally within 3GPP). \
    \ This is a model to explore\n   as the IETF coordinates further with the ITU-T\
    \ in accordance with the\n   collaboration guidelines defined in [COLLAB].\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The procedural guidelines for codec development\
    \ do not have security\n   considerations.  However, the resulting codec needs\
    \ to take\n   appropriate security considerations into account, as outlined in\n\
    \   [SECGUIDE] and in the security considerations of [CODEC-REQ].  More\n   specifically,\
    \ the resulting codec must avoid being subject to denial\n   of service [DOS]\
    \ and buffer overflows, and should take into\n   consideration the impact of variable\
    \ bitrate (VBR) [SRTP-VBR].\n"
