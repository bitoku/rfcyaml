  - "1.  Introduction\n   Section 23.4 of RFC 3261 [1] describes an integrity mechanism\
    \ that\n   relies on signing tunneled 'message/sip' MIME bodies within SIP\n \
    \  requests.  The purpose of this mechanism is to replicate the headers\n   of\
    \ a SIP request within a body carried in that request in order to\n   provide\
    \ a digital signature over these headers.  The signature on\n   this body also\
    \ provides authentication.\n   The core requirement that motivates the tunneled\
    \ 'message/sip'\n   mechanism is the problem of providing a cryptographically\
    \ verifiable\n   identity within a SIP request.  The baseline SIP protocol allows\
    \ a\n   user agent to express the identity of its user in any of a number of\n\
    \   headers.  The primary place for identity information asserted by the\n   sender\
    \ of a request is the From header.  The From header field\n   contains a URI (like\
    \ 'sip:alice@example.com') and an optional\n   display-name (like \"Alice\") that\
    \ identifies the originator of the\n   request.  A user may have many identities\
    \ that are used in different\n   contexts.\n   Typically, this URI is an address-of-record\
    \ that can be de-referenced\n   in order to contact the originator of the request;\
    \ specifically, it\n   is usually the same address-of-record under which a user\
    \ registers\n   their devices in order to receive incoming requests.  This address-\n\
    \   of-record is assigned and maintained by the administrator of the SIP\n   service\
    \ in the domain identified by the host portion of the address-\n   of-record.\
    \  However, the From field of a request can usually be set\n   arbitrarily by\
    \ the user of a SIP user agent; the From header of a\n   message provides no internal\
    \ assurance that the originating user can\n   legitimately claim the given identity.\
    \  Nevertheless, many SIP user\n   agents will obligingly display the contents\
    \ of the From field as the\n   identity of the originator of a received request\
    \ (as a sort of caller\n   identification function), much as email implementations\
    \ display the\n   From field as the sender's identity.\n   In order to provide\
    \ the recipient of a SIP message with greater\n   assurance of the identity of\
    \ the sender, a cryptographic signature\n   can be provided over the headers of\
    \ the SIP request, which allows the\n   signer to assert a verifiable identity.\
    \  Unfortunately, a signature\n   over the From header alone is insufficient because\
    \ it could be cut-\n   and-pasted into a replay or forwarding attack, and more\
    \ headers are\n   therefore needed to correlate a signature with a request.  RFC\
    \ 3261\n   therefore recommends copying all of the headers from the request into\n\
    \   a signed MIME body; however, SIP messages can be large, and many of\n   the\
    \ headers in a SIP message would not be relevant in determining the\n   identity\
    \ of the sender or assuring reference integrity with the\n   request, and moreover\
    \ some headers may change in transit for\n   perfectly valid reasons.  Thus, this\
    \ large tunneled 'message/sip'\n   body will almost necessarily be at variance\
    \ with the headers in a\n   request when it is received by the UAS, and the burden\
    \ in on the UAS\n   to determine which header changes were legitimate, and which\
    \ were\n   security violations.  It is therefore desirable to find a happy\n \
    \  medium - to provide a way of signing just enough headers that the\n   identity\
    \ of the sender can be ascertained and correlated with the\n   request.  'message/sipfrag'\
    \ [4] provides a way for a subset of SIP\n   headers to be included in a MIME\
    \ body; the Authenticated Identity\n   Body (AIB) format described in Section\
    \ 2 is based on\n   'message/sipfrag'.\n   For reasons of end-to-end privacy,\
    \ it may also be desirable to\n   encrypt AIBs; procedures for this encryption\
    \ are given in Section 8.\n   This document proposes that the AIB format should\
    \ be used instead of\n   the existing tunneled 'message/sip' mechanism described\
    \ in RFC 3261,\n   section 23.4, in order to provide the identity of the caller;\
    \ if\n   integrity over other, unrelated headers is required, then the\n   'message/sip'\
    \ mechanism should be used.\n"

- title: 2.  AIB Format
  contents:
  - "2.  AIB Format\n   As a way of sharing authenticated identity among parties in\
    \ the\n   network, a special type of MIME body format, the Authenticated\n   Identity\
    \ Body (AIB) format, is defined in this section.  AIBs allow a\n   party in a\
    \ SIP transaction to cryptographically sign the headers that\n   assert the identity\
    \ of the originator of a message, and provide some\n   other headers necessary\
    \ for reference integrity.\n   An AIB is a MIME body of type 'message/sipfrag'\
    \ - for more\n   information on constructing sipfrags, including examples, see\
    \ [4].\n   This MIME body MUST have a Content-Disposition [3] disposition-type\n\
    \   of 'aib', a new value defined in this document specifically for\n   authenticated\
    \ identity bodies.  The Content-Disposition header SHOULD\n   also contain a 'handling'\
    \ parameter indicating that this MIME body is\n   optional (i.e., if this mechanism\
    \ is not supported by the user agent\n   server, it can still attempt to process\
    \ the request).\n   AIBs using the 'message/sipfrag' MIME type MUST contain the\
    \ following\n   headers when providing identity for an INVITE request: From, Date,\n\
    \   Call-ID, and Contact; they SHOULD also contain the To and CSeq\n   header.\
    \  The security properties of these headers, and circumstances\n   in which they\
    \ should be used, are described in Section 10.  AIBs MAY\n   contain any other\
    \ headers that help to uniquely identify the\n   transaction or provide related\
    \ reference integrity.  An example of\n   the AIB format for an INVITE is:\n \
    \  Content-Type: message/sipfrag\n   Content-Disposition: aib; handling=optional\n\
    \   From: Alice <sip:alice@example.com>\n   To: Bob <sip:bob@example.net>\n  \

    \   Call-ID: a84b4c76e66710\n   CSeq: 314159 INVITE\n   Unsigned AIBs MUST be\
    \ treated by any recipients according to the\n   rules set out in Section 7 for\
    \ AIBs that do not validate.  After the\n   AIB has been signed, it SHOULD be\
    \ added to existing MIME bodies in\n   the request (such as SDP), if necessary\
    \ by transitioning the\n   outermost MIME body to a 'multipart/mixed' format.\n"

- title: 4.  AIBs for Identifying Third-Parties
  contents:
  - "4.  AIBs for Identifying Third-Parties\n   There are special-case uses of the\
    \ INVITE method in which some SIP\n   messages are exchanged with a third party\
    \ before an INVITE is sent,\n   and in which the identity of the third party needs\
    \ to be carried in\n   the subsequent INVITE.  The details of addressing identity\
    \ in such\n   contexts are outside the scope of this document.  At a high level,\
    \ it\n   is possible that identity information for a third party might be\n  \
    \ carried in a supplemental AIB.  The presence of a supplemental AIB\n   within\
    \ a message would not preclude the appearance of a 'regular' AIB\n   as specified\
    \ in this document.\n   Example cases in which supplemental AIBs might appear\
    \ include:\n      The use of the REFER [5] method, for example, has a requirement\n\
    \      for the recipient of an INVITE to ascertain the identity of the\n     \
    \ referrer who caused the INVITE to be sent.\n      Third-party call control (3PCC\
    \ [6]) has an even more complicated\n      identity problem.  A central controller\
    \ INVITEs one party, gathers\n      identity information (and session context)\
    \ from that party, and\n      then uses this information to INVITE another party.\
    \  Ideally, the\n      controller would also have a way to share a cryptographic\
    \ identity\n      signature given by the first party INVITEd by the controller\
    \ to\n      the second party invited by the controller.\n   In both of these cases,\
    \ the Call-ID and CSeq of the original request\n   (3PCC INVITE or REFER) would\
    \ not correspond with that of the request\n   in by the subsequent INVITE, nor\
    \ would the To or From.  In both the\n   REFER case and the 3PCC case, the Call-ID\
    \ and CSeq cannot be used to\n   guarantee reference integrity, and it is therefore\
    \ much harder to\n   correlate an AIB to a subsequent INVITE request.\n   Thus,\
    \ in these cases some other headers might be used to provide\n   reference integrity\
    \ between the headers in a supplemental AIB with\n   the headers of a 3PCC or\
    \ REFER-generated INVITE, but this usage is\n   outside of the scope of this document.\
    \  In order for AIBs to be used\n   in these third-party contexts, further specification\
    \ work is required\n   to determine which additional headers, if any, need to\
    \ be included in\n   an AIB in a specific third-party case, and how to differentiate\
    \ the\n   primary AIB in a message from a third-party AIB.\n"
- title: 5.  Identity in non-INVITE Requests
  contents:
  - "5.  Identity in non-INVITE Requests\n   The requirements for populating an AIB\
    \ in requests within a dialog\n   generally parallel those of the INVITE: From,\
    \ Call-ID, Date, and\n   Contact header fields are REQUIRED.\n   Some non-INVITE\
    \ requests, however, may have different identity\n   requirements.  New SIP methods\
    \ or extensions that leverage AIB\n   security MUST identify any special identity\
    \ requirements in the\n   Security Considerations of their specification.\n"
- title: 6.  Identity in Responses
  contents:
  - "6.  Identity in Responses\n   Many of the practices described in the preceding\
    \ sections can be\n   applied to responses as well as requests.  Note that a new\
    \ set of\n   headers must be generated to populate the AIB in a response.  The\n\
    \   From header field of the AIB in the response to an INVITE MUST\n   correspond\
    \ to the address-of-record of the responder, NOT to the From\n   header field\
    \ received in the request.  The To header field of the\n   request MUST NOT be\
    \ included.  A new Date header field and Contact\n   header field should be generated\
    \ for the AIB in a response.  The\n   Call-ID and CSeq should, however, be copied\
    \ from the request.\n   Generally, the To header field of the request will correspond\
    \ to the\n   address-of-record of the responder.  In some architectures where\
    \ re-\n   targeting is used, however, this need not be the case.  Some\n   recipients\
    \ of response AIBs may consider it a cause for security\n   concern if the To\
    \ header field of the request is not the same as the\n   address-of-record in\
    \ the From header field of the AIB in a response.\n"
- title: 7.  Receiving an AIB
  contents:
  - "7.  Receiving an AIB\n   When a user agent receives a request containing an AIB,\
    \ it MUST\n   verify the signature, including validating the certificate of the\n\
    \   signer, and compare the identity of the signer (the subjectAltName)\n   with,\
    \ in the INVITE case, the domain portion of the URI in the From\n   header field\
    \ of the request (for non-INVITE requests, other headers\n   MAY be subject to\
    \ this comparison).  The two should correspond\n   exactly; if they do not, the\
    \ user agent MUST report this condition to\n   its user before proceeding.  User\
    \ agents MAY distinguish between\n   plausibly minor variations (the difference\
    \ between 'example.com' and\n   'sip.example.com') and major variations ('example.com'\
    \ vs.\n   'example.org') when reporting these discrepancies in order to give\n\
    \   the user some idea of how to handle this situation.  Analysis and\n   comparison\
    \ of the Date, Call-ID, and Contact header fields as\n   described in Section\
    \ 10 MUST also be performed.  Any discrepancies or\n   violations MUST be reported\
    \ to the user.\n   When the originating user agent of a request receives a response\n\
    \   containing an AIB, it SHOULD compare the identity in the From header\n   field\
    \ of the AIB of the response with the original value of the To\n   header field\
    \ in the request.  If these represent different\n   identities, the user agent\
    \ SHOULD render the identity in the AIB of\n   the response to its user.  Note\
    \ that a discrepancy in these identity\n   fields is not necessarily an indication\
    \ of a security breach; normal\n   re-targeting may simply have directed the request\
    \ to a different\n   final destination.  Implementors therefore may consider it\n\
    \   unnecessary to alert the user of a security violation in this case.\n"
- title: 8.  Encryption of Identity
  contents:
  - "8.  Encryption of Identity\n   Many SIP entities that support the use of S/MIME\
    \ for signatures also\n   support S/MIME encryption, as described in RFC 3261,\
    \ Section 23.4.3.\n   While encryption of AIBs entails that only the holder of\
    \ a specific\n   key can decrypt the body, that single key could be distributed\n\
    \   throughout a network of hosts that exist under common policies.  The\n   security\
    \ of the AIB is therefore predicated on the secure\n   distribution of the key.\
    \  However, for some networks (in which there\n   are federations of trusted hosts\
    \ under a common policy), the\n   widespread distribution of a decryption key\
    \ could be appropriate.\n   Some telephone networks, for example, might require\
    \ this model.\n   When an AIB is encrypted, the AIB SHOULD be encrypted before\

    \ important security properties of AIB are lost.  In\n   general, the considerations\
    \ related to the inclusion of various\n   headers in an AIB are the same as those\
    \ given in RFC 3261 for\n   including headers in tunneled 'message/sip' MIME bodies\
    \ (see Section\n   23 in particular).\n   The From header field indicates the\
    \ identity of the sender of the\n   message; were this header to be excluded,\
    \ the creator of the AIB\n   essentially would not be asserting an identity at\
    \ all.  The Date and\n   Contact headers provide reference integrity and replay\
    \ protection, as\n   described in RFC 3261, Section 23.4.2.  Implementations of\
    \ this\n   specification MUST follow the rules for acceptance of the Date header\n\
    \   field in tunneled 'message/sip' requests described in RFC 3261,\n   Section\
    \ 23.4.2; this ensures that outdated AIBs will not be replayed\n   (the suggested\
    \ interval is that the Date header must indicate a time\n   within 3600 seconds\
    \ of the receipt of a message).  Implementations\n   MUST also record Call-IDs\
    \ received in AIBs, and MUST remember those\n   Call-IDs for at least the duration\
    \ of a single Date interval (i.e.,\n   3600 seconds).  Accordingly, if an AIB\
    \ is replayed within the Date\n   interval, receivers will recognize that it is\
    \ invalid because of a\n   Call-ID duplication; if an AIB is replayed after the\
    \ Date interval,\n   receivers will recognize that it is invalid because the Date\
    \ is\n   stale.  The Contact header field is included to tie the AIB to a\n  \
    \ particular device instance that generated the request.  Were an\n   active attacker\
    \ to intercept a request containing an AIB, and cut-\n   and-paste the AIB into\
    \ their own request (reusing the From, Contact,\n   Date, and Call-ID fields that\
    \ appear in the AIB), they would not be\n   eligible to receive SIP requests from\
    \ the called user agent, since\n   those requests are routed to the URI identified\
    \ in the Contact header\n   field.\n   The To and CSeq header fields provide properties\
    \ that are generally\n   useful, but not for all possible applications of AIBs.\
    \  If a new AIB\n   is issued each time a new SIP transaction is initiated in\
    \ a dialog,\n   the CSeq header field provides a valuable property (replay protection\n\
    \   for this particular transaction).  If, however, one AIB is used for\n   an\
    \ entire dialog, subsequent transactions in the dialog would use the\n   same\
    \ AIB that appeared in the INVITE transaction.  Using a single AIB\n   for an\
    \ entire dialog reduces the load on the generator of the AIB.\n   The To header\
    \ field usually designates the original URI that the\n   caller intended to reach,\
    \ and therefore it may vary from the\n   Request-URI if re-targeting occurs at\
    \ some point in the network.\n   Accordingly, including the To header field in\
    \ the AIB helps to\n   identify cut-and-paste attacks in which an AIB sent to\
    \ a particular\n   destination is re-used to impersonate the sender to a different\n\
    \   destination.  However, the inclusion of the To header field probably\n   would\
    \ not make sense for many third-party AIB cases (as described in\n   Section 4),\
    \ nor is its inclusion necessary for responses.\n"
