- title: 1.  The Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The Network Management Framework\n   The Internet-standard Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of three\n   components.  They are:\n      RFC 1155 which\
    \ defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing\n      and naming objects\
    \ for the purpose of management.  RFC 1212\n      defines a more concise description\
    \ mechanism, which is wholly\n      consistent with the SMI.\n      RFC 1156 which\
    \ defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for\n      the Internet suite\
    \ of protocols.  RFC 1213, defines MIB-II, an\n      evolution of MIB-I based\
    \ on implementation experience and new\n      operational requirements.\n    \
    \  RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network\n      access\
    \ to managed objects.\n   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for\
    \ the purpose of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n"
- title: 2.  Objects
  contents:
  - "2.  Objects\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,\
    \ termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n\
    \   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [7]\n   defined\
    \ in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,\n   and an encoding.\
    \  The name is an object identifier, an\n   administratively assigned name, which\
    \ specifies an object type.  The\n   object type together with an object instance\
    \ serves to uniquely\n   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For\
    \ human\n   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT\n  \
    \ DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.\n   The syntax of an object type\
    \ defines the abstract data structure\n   corresponding to that object type. \
    \ The ASN.1 language is used for\n   this purpose.  However, the SMI [3] purposely\
    \ restricts the ASN.1\n   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are\
    \ explicitly made\n   for simplicity.\n   The encoding of an object type is simply\
    \ how that object type is\n   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly\
    \ tied to the\n   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object\
    \ type\n   is represented when being transmitted on the network.\n   The SMI specifies\
    \ the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8],\n   subject to the additional\
    \ requirements imposed by the SNMP.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Format of Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Format of Definitions\n   Section 4 contains the specification of all object\
    \ types contained in\n   this MIB module.  The object types are defined using\
    \ the conventions\n   defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified\
    \ in [9].\n"
- title: 3.  Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview\n   The objects defined in this MIB module are be used when the\
    \ ISO\n   Connectionless-mode Network Protocol [10] and End System to\n   Intermediate\
    \ System [11] protocols are present.  No assumptions are\n   made as to what underlying\
    \ protocol is being used to carry the SNMP.\n   This memo uses the string encoding\
    \ of [12] to textually describe OSI\n   addresses.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Textual Conventions
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Textual Conventions\n   A new data type is introduced as a textual convention\
    \ in this MIB\n   document.  This textual conventions enhance the readability\
    \ of the\n   specification and can ease comparison with other specifications if\n\
    \   appropriate.  It should be noted that the introduction of this\n   textual\
    \ convention has no effect on either the syntax nor the\n   semantics of any managed\
    \ objects.  The use of this is merely an\n   artifact of the explanatory method\
    \ used.  Objects defined in terms of\n   this methods are always encoded by means\
    \ of the rules that define the\n   primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI\
    \ or the SNMP are\n   necessary to accommodate this textual convention which are\
    \ adopted\n   merely for the convenience of readers and writers in pursuit of\
    \ the\n   elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.\n   The\
    \ ASN.1 type ClnpAddress is used to denote an OSI address.  This\n   consists\
    \ of a string of octets.  The first octet of the string\n   contains a binary\
    \ value in the range of 0..20, and indicates the the\n   length in octets of the\
    \ NSAP.  Following the first octet, is the\n   NSAP, expressed in concrete binary\
    \ notation, starting with the most\n   significant octet.  A zero- length NSAP\
    \ is used as a \"special\"\n   address meaning \"the default NSAP\" (analogous\
    \ to the IP address of\n   0.0.0.0).  Such an NSAP is encoded as a single octet,\
    \ containing the\n   value 0.  All other NSAPs are encoded in at least 4 octets.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Changes from RFC 1162
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Changes from RFC 1162\n   Features of this MIB include:\n      (1)  The\
    \ managed objects in this document have been defined\n           using the conventions\
    \ defined in the Internet-standard\n           SMI, as amended by the extensions\
    \ specified in [9].  It\n           must be emphasized that definitions made using\
    \ these\n           extensions are semantically identically to those in RFC\n\
    \           1162.\n      (2)  The PhysAddress textual convention from MIB-II has\
    \ been\n           introduced to represent media addresses.\n      (3)  The clnpRoutingDiscards,\
    \ clnpRouteMetric5, and\n           clnpRouteInfo objects have been defined.\n\
    \      (4)  The ClnpAddress type was mistakenly given a tag in RFC\n         \
    \  1162.  This error has been corrected.\n"
