  - "1.  Motivation\n   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [RFC2131] and [RFC3315]
    can be\n   used to configure various non-IP address type of parameters.  These\n
    \  parameters are required for normal operation of various services that\n   are
    offered over an IP network.\n   Broadcast and Multicast Service (BCMCS) is one
    such service that is\n   being standardized in various mobile wireless standard
    bodies such as\n   Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2), Open Mobile
    Alliance\n   (OMA), and 3GPP.  A description of the BCMCS as defined in 3GPP2
    can\n   be found in [BCMCS].\n   While DHCP already defines many options for device
    configuration, no\n   option exists for configuring a mobile device to use BCMCS.
    \ This\n   memo defines extensions for both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 so that DHCP can\n
    \  be used to provide necessary configuration information to a mobile\n   device
    about the BCMCS controllers.\n   DHCP is being used in 3GPP2, to assist Mobile
    Nodes (MNs) with the\n   discovery of the BCMCS Controller in a mobile operator's
    IP network.\n   The BCMCS includes a controller component that is responsible
    for\n   managing the service via interaction with the MN and other network\n   entities.
    \ In this document, we will call this a BCMCS controller.\n   An overview of the
    3GPP2 BCMCS architecture is given in the next\n   section.  It provides enough
    information to understand the basics of\n   the 3GPP2 BCMCS operation.  Readers
    are encouraged to find a more\n   detailed description in [BCMCS].\n   As described
    in [BCMCS], the MNs are required to know the IPv4 or the\n   IPv6 address of the
    BCMCS controller entity so that they can download\n   all the necessary information
    about a desired broadcast and/or a\n   multicast program.  In a roaming environment,
    static configuration of\n   the BCMCS controller's IP address becomes unrealistic.
    \ Therefore,\n   DHCP is considered to be a method to dynamically configure the
    MNs\n   with the IP address or the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the\n
    \  BCMCS controller in the 3G cellular telephone networks.\n   In order to allow
    the MNs to discover the BCMCS controllers, the MNs\n   request the appropriate
    option codes from the DHCP server.  The DHCP\n   servers need to return the corresponding
    configuration options that\n   carry either BCMCS controller's IP address or FQDN
    based on\n   configuration.  This document defines the necessary options and\n
    \  option codes.\n"

    works in a 3G cellular telephone\n   network.  The network elements except MN/user
    and the DHCP server are\n   not relevant to the text in this document.\n   The
    MN interacts with the BCMCS Controller to request broadcast/\n   multicast program
    information from the network (e.g., scheduled time,\n   multicast IP address,
    port numbers).  The MN may also be\n   authenticated by the BCMCS Controller while
    downloading the relevant\n   program-security-related information (such as encryption
    key).  These\n   interactions may happen via HTTP and XML as defined in [BCMCS].\n
    \  There may be more than one BCMCS controller in the network.  The MN\n   should
    discover the appropriate BCMCS controller to request the\n   relevant program
    information.  For details of Broadcast and Multicast\n   Service operation in

    - "4.1.  Broadcast and Multicast Service Controller Domain Name List for\n      DHCPv4\n
      \  The general format of the BCMCS Controller Domain list option for\n   DHCPv4
      is as follows:\n           Code  Len  FQDN(s) of BCMCS Controller\n         +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--\n
      \        | 88  |  n  |  s1 |  s2 |  s3 |  s4 | s5  |  ...\n         +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--\n
      \  The option MAY contain multiple domain names, but these domain names\n   SHOULD
      be used to construct Service Record (SRV) lookups as specified\n   in [BCMCS],
      rather than querying for different A records.  The client\n   can try any or
      ALL of the domain names to construct the SRV lookups.\n   The list of domain
      names MAY contain the domain name of the access\n   provider and its partner
      networks that also offer Broadcast and\n   Multicast Service.\n   As an example,
      the access provider may have one or more partners or\n   resellers often termed
      as MVNOs (Mobile Virtual Network Operators)\n   for Broadcast and Multicast
      Service.  In this case, the access\n   provider should be able to use the same
      DHCP option to send multiple\n   of those domain names (MVNOs).  To illustrate
      this further, let's\n   assume that the access provider (operator) has a reseller
      agreement\n   with two MVNOs: mvno1 and mvno2.  Therefore, the Broadcast and\n
      \  Multicast Service Controller Domain Name list for the DHCPv4 option\n   will
      contain three domain names: operator.com, mvno1.com, and\n   mvno2.com.  Upon
      receiving this option, the BCMCS client may choose\n   to use one of the domain
      names to fetch the appropriate BCMCS\n   controller address (based on user's
      preference or configuration).  If\n   no preferred domain name is found in the
      received list, the client\n   should use a default setting, e.g., use the first
      one in the list.\n   If the length of the domain list exceeds the maximum permissible\n
      \  length within a single option (254 octets), then the domain list MUST\n   be
      represented in the DHCPv4 message as specified in [RFC3396].  An\n   example
      case when two controller domain names, example.com and\n   example.net, are
      returned will be:\n   +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n
