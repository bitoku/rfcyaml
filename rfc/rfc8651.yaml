  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) is defined in
    [RFC8175].\n   It provides the exchange of link-related control information between\n
    \  a modem and a router.  DLEP defines a base set of mechanisms as well\n   as
    support for possible extensions.  This document defines one such\n   extension.\n
    \  The base DLEP specification does not include any data-plane\n   flow-control
    capability.  The extension defined in this document\n   supports flow control
    of data traffic based on explicit messages sent\n   via DLEP by a modem to indicate
    when a router should hold off sending\n   traffic and when it should resume.  This
    functionality parallels the\n   flow-control mechanism found in PPP over Ethernet
    (PPPoE) per\n   [RFC5578].  The extension also optionally supports DSCP-aware
    flow\n   control (\"DSCP\" stands for \"Differentiated Services Code Point\")
    for\n   use by Diffserv-aware modems.  (For general background on\n   Differentiated
    Services, see [RFC2475].)  This functionality is very\n   similar to that provided
    by Ethernet priority-based flow control; see\n   [IEEE.802.1Q_2014].  The extension
    defined in this document is\n   referred to as \"Control-Plane-Based Pause\".
    \ Other flow-control\n   methods are possible with DLEP; for example, see [DLEP-DIFFSERV]
    and\n   [DLEP-CREDIT].\n   Note that this mechanism only applies to traffic that
    is to be\n   transmitted on the modem's attached data channel and not to DLEP\n
    \  control messages themselves.  Furthermore, it applies only to the\n   single
    subnetwork that is used to connect a modem and a router, and\n   for traffic sent
    from a router to a modem.\n   This document defines a new DLEP Extension Type
    Value that is used to\n   indicate the use of the extension; see Section 2.  Three
    new DLEP\n   Data Items are defined in Section 3.\n"

  - "2.  Extension Usage and Identification\n   The use of the Control-Plane-Based
    Pause Extension SHOULD be\n   configurable.  To indicate that the implementation
    supports the use\n   of the Control-Plane-Based Pause Extension, an implementation
    MUST\n   include the Control-Plane-Based Pause Extension Type Value in the\n   Extensions
    Supported Data Item.  The Extensions Supported Data Item\n   is sent and processed
    according to [RFC8175].\n   The Control-Plane-Based Pause Extension Type Value
    is 2; see\n   Section 5.\n"
  title: 2.  Extension Usage and Identification
- contents:
  - "3.  Extension Data Items\n   Three Data Items are defined by this extension.
    \ The Queue Parameters\n   Data Item is used by a modem to provide information
    about the DSCPs\n   it uses in forwarding.  The Pause Data Item is used by a modem
    to\n   indicate when a router should cease sending packets, and the Restart\n
    \  Data Item is used by a modem to indicate when a router can resume\n   sending
    packets.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Queue Parameters\n   The Queue Parameters Data Item is sent by a modem
      to a router to\n   indicate DSCP values that may be independently paused.  This
      Data\n   Item MUST be included in a Session Initialization Response Message\n
      \  that also contains the Control-Plane-Based Pause Extension Type Value\n   in
      the Extensions Supported Data Item.  Updates to these parameters\n   MAY be
      sent by a modem by including the Data Item in Session Update\n   Messages.\n
      \  The Queue Parameters Data Item groups DSCPs into logical queues, each\n   of
      which is identified by a \"Queue Index\" field.  The number of\n   logical queues
      is variable, as is the number of DSCPs associated with\n   each queue.  A queue
      size (in bytes) is provided for informational\n   purposes.  Queue Index fields
      are numbered sequentially from zero,\n   where queue index zero is a special
      case covering DSCPs that are not\n   otherwise associated with a Queue Index
      field.\n   An implementation that does not support DSCPs would indicate one\n
      \  queue with zero DSCPs, and the number of bytes that may be in its\n   associated
      link transmit queue.  Additional logical queues are\n   represented in a variable
      series of Queue Parameter Sub-Data Items.\n   The format of the Queue Parameters

    - "3.2.  Pause\n   The Pause Data Item is sent by a modem to a router to indicate
      to its\n   peer that traffic is to be suppressed, i.e., paused.  The motivating\n
      \  use case for this Data Item is when a modem's internal queue length\n   exceeds
      a particular threshold.  Other use cases are possible, e.g.,\n   when there
      are non-queue-related congestion points within a modem.\n   Such cases are not
      explicitly described in this document.\n   A modem can indicate that traffic
      is to be suppressed on a\n   device-wide or destination-specific basis.  An
      example of when a\n   modem might use device-wide suppression is when output
      queues are\n   shared across all destinations.  Destination-specific suppression\n
      \  might be used when per-destination queuing is used.  To indicate that\n   suppression
      applies to all destinations, a modem MUST send the Pause\n   Data Item in a
      Session Update Message.  To indicate that suppression\n   applies to a particular
      destination, a modem MUST send the Pause Data\n   Item in a Destination Update
      Message.\n   Each Pause Data Item identifies the traffic to be suppressed by
      the\n   Queue Index field (Section 3.1), which in turn indicates traffic\n   identified
      by one or more DSCPs.  The special value of 255 is used to\n   indicate that
      all traffic is to be suppressed.\n   While there is no restriction on the number
      of messages containing\n   Pause Data Items that may be sent by a modem, a modem
      SHOULD include\n   multiple queue indexes in the same message when possible.\n
      \  A router that receives the Pause Data Item MUST cease sending the\n   identified
      traffic to the modem.  This may of course translate into\n   the router's queues
      exceeding their own thresholds.  If a received\n   Pause Data Item contains
      a Queue Index value other than 255 or a\n   queue index established by a Session
      Initialization or Session Update\n   Message, the router MUST terminate the
      session with a Status Data\n   Item indicating \"Invalid Data\".\n   The format
      of the Pause Data Item is:\n       0                   1                   2

      fields.  It will equal the number of\n      Queue Index fields carried in the
      Data Item.\n   Queue Index:\n      One or more 8-bit fields used to indicate
      a queue index defined by\n      a Queue Parameters Data Item.  The special value
      of 255 indicates\n      that (1) all traffic to the modem is to be suppressed
      when the\n      Data Item is carried in a Session Update Message or (2) all\n
      \     traffic to a particular destination is to be suppressed when the\n      Data

      an internal queue length drops below a particular threshold.\n   The sending
      of this Data Item parallels the Pause Data Item (see\n   Section 3.2) and follows
      the same rules.  To indicate that\n   transmission can resume to all destinations,
      a modem MUST send the\n   Restart Data Item in a Session Update Message.  To

    \  from those documented in [RFC8175].  The approach taken to security\n   in

    \  Implementations of the extension defined in this document MUST\n   support

    configurations where injection attacks are\n   possible, i.e., when the link between
    a modem and router is not\n   otherwise protected.\n   Note that this extension
    does allow a compromised or impersonating\n   modem to suppress transmission by
    the router or a switch that\n   interconnects the modem and router.  Similar attacks
    are generally\n   possible with base DLEP -- for example, an impersonating modem
    may\n   cause a session reset, or a compromised modem can simply drop all\n   traffic
    destined for or sent by a router.  [RFC8175] defines the use\n   of TLS to protect
