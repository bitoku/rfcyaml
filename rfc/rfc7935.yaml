- title: 2.  Algorithms
  contents:
  - "2.  Algorithms\n   Two cryptographic algorithms are used in the RPKI:\n     \
    \ *  The signature algorithm used in certificates, CRLs, CMS signed\n        \
    \ objects, and certification requests is RSA Public-Key\n         Cryptography\
    \ Standards (PKCS) #1 Version 1.5 (sometimes\n         referred to as \"RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5\"\
    ) from Section 8.2 of\n         [RFC3447].\n      *  The hashing algorithm used\
    \ in certificates, CRLs, CMS signed\n         objects and certification requests\
    \ is SHA-256 [SHS] (see note\n         below).\n         NOTE: The exception is\
    \ the use of SHA-1 [SHS] when CAs generate\n         authority and subject key\
    \ identifiers [RFC6487].\n   In certificates, CRLs, and certification requests\
    \ the hashing and\n   digital signature algorithms are identified together, i.e.,\
    \ \"RSA\n   PKCS #1 v1.5 with SHA-256\" or more simply \"RSA with SHA-256\". \
    \ The\n   Object Identifier (OID) sha256WithRSAEncryption from [RFC4055] MUST\n\
    \   be used in these products.\n   The OID is in the following locations:\n  \
    \    In the certificate, the OID appears in the signature and\n      signatureAlgorithm\
    \ fields [RFC4055].\n      In the CRL, the OID appears in the signatureAlgorithm\
    \ field\n      [RFC4055].\n      In a certification request, the OID appears in\
    \ the PKCS #10\n      signatureAlgorithm field [RFC2986], or in the Certificate\
    \ Request\n      Message Format (CRMF) POPOSigningKey algorithmIdentifier field\n\
    \      [RFC4211].\n   In CMS SignedData, the hashing (message digest) and digital\
    \ signature\n   algorithms are identified separately.  The object identifier and\n\
    \   parameters for SHA-256 (as defined in [RFC5754]) MUST be used for the\n  \
    \ SignedData digestAlgorithms field and the SignerInfo digestAlgorithm\n   field.\
    \  The object identifier and parameters for rsaEncryption\n   [RFC3370] MUST be\
    \ used for the SignerInfo signatureAlgorithm field\n   when generating CMS SignedData\
    \ objects.  RPKI implementations MUST\n   accept either rsaEncryption or sha256WithRSAEncryption\
    \ for the\n   SignerInfo signatureAlgorithm field when verifying CMS SignedData\n\
    \   objects (for compatibility with objects produced by implementations\n   conforming\
    \ to [RFC6485]).\n"
- title: 3.  Asymmetric Key Pair Formats
  contents:
  - "3.  Asymmetric Key Pair Formats\n   The RSA key pairs used to compute the signatures\
    \ MUST have a 2048-bit\n   modulus and a public exponent (e) of 65,537.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Public Key Format
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Public Key Format\n   The subject's public key is included in subjectPublicKeyInfo\n\
    \   [RFC5280].  It has two sub-fields: algorithm and subjectPublicKey.\n   The\
    \ values for the structures and their sub-structures follow:\n   algorithm (which\
    \ is an AlgorithmIdentifier type):\n      The object identifier for RSA PKCS #1\
    \ v1.5 with SHA-256 MUST be\n      used in the algorithm field, as specified in\
    \ Section 5 of\n      [RFC4055].  The value for the associated parameters from\
    \ that\n      clause MUST also be used for the parameters field.\n   subjectPublicKey:\n\
    \      RSAPublicKey MUST be used to encode the certificate's\n      subjectPublicKey\
    \ field, as specified in [RFC4055].\n"
- title: 3.2.  Private Key Format
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Private Key Format\n   Local policy determines the private key format.\n"
- title: 4.  Signature Format
  contents:
  - "4.  Signature Format\n   The structure for the certificate's signature field\
    \ is as specified\n   in Section 1.2 of [RFC4055].  The structure for the signature\
    \ field\n   in the CMS SignedData's SignerInfos is as specified in [RFC5652].\n"
- title: 5.  Additional Requirements
  contents:
  - "5.  Additional Requirements\n   It is anticipated that the RPKI will require\
    \ the adoption of updated\n   key sizes and a different set of signature and hash\
    \ algorithms over\n   time, in order to maintain an acceptable level of cryptographic\n\
    \   security to protect the integrity of signed products in the RPKI.\n   This\
    \ profile should be replaced to specify such future requirements,\n   as and when\
    \ appropriate.\n   The procedures to implement such a transition of key sizes\
    \ and\n   algorithms are specified in [RFC6916].\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The Security Considerations of [RFC4055], [RFC5280],\
    \ and [RFC6487]\n   apply to certificates and CRLs.  The Security Considerations\
    \ of\n   [RFC2986], [RFC4211], and [RFC6487] apply to certification requests.\n\
    \   The Security Considerations of [RFC5754] apply to CMS signed objects.\n  \
    \ No new security threats are introduced as a result of this\n   specification.\n"
- title: 7.  Changes Applied to RFC 6485
  contents:
  - "7.  Changes Applied to RFC 6485\n   This update includes a slight technical change\
    \ to [RFC6485] that is\n   considered to be outside the limited scope of an erratum.\
    \  The\n   document update process has included other errata and also corrected\n\
    \   a number of nits.\n   Section 2 of [RFC6485] specified sha256WithRSAEncryption\
    \ as the OID\n   to use for the SignerInfo signatureAlgorithm field in CMS\n \
    \  SignedObjects.  However, existing implementations use the\n   rsaEncryption\
    \ OID for this field.  (Support for rsaEncryption in\n   third-party cryptographic\
    \ libraries is better than\n   sha256WithRSAEncryption, perhaps because [RFC3370]\
    \ says that support\n   for rsaEncryption is required, while support for OIDs\
    \ that specify\n   both RSA and a digest algorithm is optional.)\n   Rather than\
    \ force existing implementations to switch to\n   sha256WithRSAEncryption, this\
    \ document was changed to follow existing\n   practice.  This does not represent\
    \ a cryptographic algorithm change,\n   just an identifier change.  (Unlike certificates,\
    \ CRLs, and\n   certification requests, CMS signed objects have a separate algorithm\n\
    \   identifier field for the hash (digest) algorithm, and that field is\n   already\
    \ required to contain the id-sha256 OID per Section 2.)\n   To avoid compatibility\
    \ problems, RPs are still required to accept\n   sha256WithRSAEncryption if encountered.\n\
    \   Other changes include:\n      *  Minor wording and typo fixes.\n      *  Corrections\
    \ to references ([RFC5652] instead of [RFC3370],\n         [RFC3447] instead of\
    \ [RFC4055]).\n      *  Additional citations included in the Introduction.\n \
    \     *  Correction to the CRMF POPOSigningKey field that is mentioned\n     \
    \    in Section 2 (algorithmIdentifier instead of signature).\n      *  Inclusion\
    \ of certification requests in mentions of\n         certificates, CRLs, and CMS\
    \ signed objects.\n      *  Replacement of text in Section 5 with a pointer to\
    \ the\n         procedures specified in [RFC6916] (algorithm agility).\n     \
    \ *  Replacement of \"signed object\" with \"CMS signed object\"\n         everywhere.\n"
