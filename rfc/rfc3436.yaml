  - "1.1.  Overview\n   This document describes the usage of the Transport Layer Security\n\
    \   (TLS) protocol, as defined in [RFC2246], over the Stream Control\n   Transmission\
    \ Protocol (SCTP), as defined in [RFC2960] and [RFC3309].\n   TLS is designed\
    \ to run on top of a byte-stream oriented transport\n   protocol providing a reliable,\
    \ in-sequence delivery.  Thus, TLS is\n   currently mainly being used on top of\
    \ the Transmission Control\n   Protocol (TCP), as defined in [RFC793].\n   Comparing\
    \ TCP and SCTP, the latter provides additional features and\n   this document\
    \ shows how TLS should be used with SCTP to provide some\n   of these additional\
    \ features to the TLS user.\n   This document defines:\n   -   how to use the\
    \ multiple streams feature of SCTP.\n   -   how to handle the message oriented\
    \ nature of SCTP.\n   It should be noted that the TLS user can take advantage\
    \ of the multi-\n   homing support of SCTP.  The dynamic reconfiguration of IP-addresses,\n\
    \   as currently being discussed, can also be used with the described\n   solution.\n\
    \   The method described in this document does not require any changes of\n  \
    \ TLS or SCTP.  It is only required that SCTP implementations support\n   the\
    \ optional feature of fragmentation of SCTP user messages.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Number of Inbound and Outbound Streams\n   An association between the endpoints\
    \ A and Z provides n streams from\n   A to Z and m streams from Z to A.\n   A\
    \ pair consisting of two streams with the same stream identifier is\n   considered\
    \ and used as one bi-directional stream.\n   Thus an SCTP association can be considered\
    \ as a set of min(n,m) bi-\n   directional streams and (max(n,m) - min(n,m)) uni-directional\n\
    \   streams.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Fragmentation of User Messages
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Fragmentation of User Messages\n   To avoid the knowledge and handling\
    \ of the MTU inside TLS, SCTP MUST\n   provide fragmentation of user messages,\
    \ which is an optional feature\n   of [RFC2960].  Since SCTP is a message oriented\
    \ protocol, it must be\n   able to transmit all TLS records as SCTP user messages.\
    \  Thus the\n   supported maximum length of SCTP user messages MUST be at least\
    \ 2^14\n   + 2048 + 5 = 18437 bytes, which is the maximum length of a\n   TLSCiphertext,\
    \ as defined in [RFC2246].\n   Please note that an SCTP implementation might need\
    \ to support the\n   partial delivery API to be able to support the transport\
    \ of user\n   messages of this size.\n   Therefore, SCTP takes care of fragmenting\
    \ and reassembling the TLS\n   records in order to avoid IP-fragmentation.\n"

- title: 5.  Connections and Bi-directional Streams
  contents:
  - "5.  Connections and Bi-directional Streams\n   TLS makes use of a bi-directional\
    \ stream by establishing a connection\n   over it.  This means that the number\
    \ of connections for an\n   association is limited by the number of bi-directional\
    \ streams.\n   The TLS handshake protocol is used on each bi-directional stream\n\
    \   separately.  Each handshake can be:\n   -  a full handshake or\n   -  an abbreviated\
    \ handshake that resumes a TLS session with a session\n      id from another connection\
    \ (on the same or another association).\n   After completing the handshake for\
    \ a connection, the bi-directional\n   stream can be used for TLS-based user data\
    \ transmission.  It should\n   also be noted that the handshakes for the different\
    \ connections are\n   independent and can be delayed until the bi-directional\
    \ stream is\n   used for user data transmission.\n"
- title: 6.  Usage of bi-directional streams
  contents:
  - "6.  Usage of bi-directional streams\n   It is not required that all bi-directional\
    \ streams are used for TLS-\n   based user data transmission.  If TLS is not used,\
    \ it is called SCTP-\n   based user data transmission.\n"
- title: 6.1.  SCTP-based user data transmission
  contents:
  - "6.1.  SCTP-based user data transmission\n   If a bi-directional stream is not\
    \ used for TLS-based communication\n   there are no restrictions on the features\
    \ provided by SCTP for SCTP-\n   based user data transmission.\n"
- title: 6.2.  TLS-based user data transmission
  contents:
  - "6.2.  TLS-based user data transmission\n   In general, the bi-directional stream\
    \ will be used for TLS-based user\n   data transmission and it SHOULD NOT be used\
    \ for SCTP-based user data\n   transmission.  The exception to this rule is for\
    \ protocols which\n   contain upgrade-to-TLS mechanisms, such as those of HTTP\
    \ upgrade\n   [RFC2817] and SMTP over TLS [RFC3207].\n   TLS requires that the\
    \ underlying transport delivers TLS records in\n   strict sequence.  Thus, the\
    \ 'unordered delivery' feature of SCTP MUST\n   NOT be used on streams which are\
    \ used for TLS based user data\n   transmission.  For the same reason, TLS records\
    \ delivered to SCTP for\n   transmission MUST NOT have limited lifetimes.\n"
- title: 7.  Usage of uni-directional streams
  contents:
  - "7.  Usage of uni-directional streams\n   The uni-directional streams can not\
    \ be used for TLS-based user data\n   transmission.  Nevertheless, they can be\
    \ used without any\n   restrictions for SCTP-based communication.\n"
- title: 8.  Examples
  contents:
  - "8.  Examples\n   In these examples we consider the case of an association with\
    \ two\n   bi-directional streams.\n"
- title: 8.1.  Two Bi-directional Streams with Full Handshake
  contents:
  - "8.1.  Two Bi-directional Streams with Full Handshake\n   Just after the association\
    \ has been established, the client sends two\n   ClientHello messages on the bi-directional\
    \ streams 0 and 1.  After a\n   full handshake has been completed on each bi-directional\
    \ stream,\n   TLS-based user data transmission can take place on that stream.\
    \  It\n   is possible that on the bi-directional stream 0, the handshake has\n\
    \   been completed, and user data transmission is ongoing, while on the\n   bi-directional\
    \ stream 1, the handshake has not been completed, or\n   vice versa.\n"
- title: 8.2.  Two Bi-directional Streams with an Abbreviated Handshake
  contents:
  - "8.2.  Two Bi-directional Streams with an Abbreviated Handshake\n   After establishing\
    \ the association, the client starts a full\n   handshake on the bi-directional\
    \ stream 0.  The server provides a\n   session identifier which allows session\
    \ resumption.  After the full\n   handshake has been completed, the client initiates\
    \ an abbreviated\n   handshake on the bi-directional stream 1, using the session\n\
    \   identifier from the handshake on the bi-directional stream 0.  User\n   data\
    \ can be transmitted on the bi-directional stream 0, but not on\n   the bi-directional\
    \ stream stream 1 in that state.  After completion\n   of the abbreviated handshake\
    \ on the bi-directional stream 1, user\n   data can be transmitted on both streams.\n\
    \   Whether or not to use abbreviated handshakes during the setup phase\n   of\
    \ a TLS connection over an SCTP association depends on several\n   factors:\n\
    \   -  the complexity and duration of the initial handshake processing\n     \
    \ (also determined by the number of connections),\n   -  the network performance\
    \ (round-trip times, bandwidth).\n   Abbreviated handshakes can reduce computational\
    \ complexity of the\n   handshake considerably, in case this is a limiting resource.\
    \  If a\n   large number of connections need to be established, it may be\n  \
    \ advantageous to use the TLS session resumption feature.  On the other\n   hand,\
    \ before an abbreviated handshake can take place, a full\n   handshake needs to\
    \ have been completed.  In networks with large\n   round-trip time delays, it\
    \ may be favorable to perform a number of\n   full handshakes in parallel. Therefore,\
    \ both possibilities are\n   allowed.\n"
- title: 8.3.  Two Bi-directional Streams with a Delayed Abbreviated Handshake
  contents:
  - "8.3.  Two Bi-directional Streams with a Delayed Abbreviated Handshake\n   This\
    \ example resembles the last one, but after the completion of the\n   full handshake\
    \ on the bi-directional stream 0, the abbreviated\n   handshake on the bi-directional\
    \ stream 1 is not started immediately.\n   The bi-directional stream 0 can be\
    \ used for user data transmission.\n   It is only when the user also wants to\
    \ transmit data on the bi-\n   directional stream 1 that the abbreviated handshake\
    \ for the bi-\n   directional stream 1 is initiated.\n   This allows the user\
    \ of TLS to request a large number of bi-\n   directional streams without having\
    \ to provide all the resources at\n   association start-up if not all bi-directional\
    \ streams are used right\n   from the beginning.\n"
- title: 8.4.  Two Bi-directional Streams without Full Handshakes
  contents:
  - "8.4.  Two Bi-directional Streams without Full Handshakes\n   This example is\
    \ like the second and third one, but an abbreviated\n   handshake is used for\
    \ both bi-directional streams.  This requires the\n   existence of a valid session\
    \ identifier from connections handled by\n   another association.\n"
- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   Using TLS on top of SCTP does not provide any\
    \ new security issues\n   beside the ones discussed in [RFC2246] and [RFC2960].\n\
    \   It is possible to authenticate TLS endpoints based on IP-addresses in\n  \
    \ certificates.  Unlike TCP, SCTP associations can use multiple\n   addresses\
    \ per SCTP endpoint.  Therefore it is possible that TLS\n   records will be sent\
    \ from a different IP-address than that originally\n   authenticated.  This is\
    \ not a problem provided that no security\n   decisions are made based on that\
    \ IP-address.  This is a special case\n   of a general rule:  all decisions should\
    \ be based on the peer's\n   authenticated identity, not on its transport layer\
    \ identity.\n"
