  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines a Media Delivery Index (MDI) measurement that\
    \ can\n   be used as a diagnostic tool or a quality indicator for monitoring a\n\
    \   network intended to deliver applications such as streaming media,\n   MPEG\
    \ video, Voice over IP, or other information sensitive to arrival\n   time and\
    \ packet loss.  It provides an indication of traffic jitter, a\n   measure of\
    \ deviation from nominal flow rates, and a data loss\n   at-a-glance measure for\
    \ a particular flow.  For instance, the MDI may\n   be used as a reference in\
    \ characterizing and comparing networks\n   carrying UDP streaming media.\n  \
    \ The MDI measurement defined in this memo is intended for Information\n   only.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   There has been considerable progress over the last several\
    \ years in\n   the development of methods to provide for Quality of Service (QoS)\n\
    \   over packet-switched networks to improve the delivery of streaming\n   media\
    \ and other time-sensitive and packet-loss-sensitive applications\n   such as\
    \ [i1], [i5], [i6], [i7].  QoS is required for many practical\n   networks involving\
    \ applications such as video transport to assure the\n   availability of network\
    \ bandwidth by providing upper limits on the\n   number of flows admitted to a\
    \ network, as well as to bound the packet\n   jitter introduced by the network.\
    \  These bounds are required to\n   dimension a receiver`s buffer to display the\
    \ video properly in real\n   time without buffer overflow or underflow.\n   Now\
    \ that large-scale implementations of such networks based on RSVP\n   and Diffserv\
    \ are undergoing trials [i3] and being specified by major\n   service providers\
    \ for the transport of streaming media such as MPEG\n   video [i4], there is a\
    \ need to diagnose issues easily and to monitor\n   the real-time effectiveness\
    \ of networks employing these QoS methods\n   or to assess whether they are required.\
    \  Furthermore, due to the\n   significant installed base of legacy networks without\
    \ QoS methods, a\n   delivery system`s transitional solution may be composed of\
    \ networks\n   with and without these methods, thus increasing the difficulty\
    \ in\n   characterizing the dynamic behavior of these networks.\n   The purpose\
    \ of this memo is to describe a set of measurements that\n   can be used to derive\
    \ a Media Delivery Index (MDI) that indicates the\n   instantaneous and longer-term\
    \ behavior of networks carrying streaming\n   media such as MPEG video.\n   While\
    \ this memo addresses monitoring MPEG Transport Stream (TS)\n   packets [i8] over\
    \ UDP, the general approach is expected to be\n   applicable to other streaming\
    \ media and protocols.  The approach is\n   applicable to both constant and variable\
    \ bit rate streams though the\n   variable bit rate case may be somewhat more\
    \ difficult to calculate.\n   This document focuses on the constant bit rate case\
    \ as the example to\n   describe the measurement, but as long as the dynamic bit\
    \ rate of the\n   encoded stream can be determined (the \"drain rate\" as described\
    \ below\n   in Section 3), then the MDI provides the measurement of network-\n\
    \   induced cumulative jitter.  Suggestions and direction for calculation\n  \
    \ of MDI for a variable bit rate encoded stream may be the subject of a\n   future\
    \ document.\n   Network packet delivery time variation and various statistics\
    \ to\n   characterize the same are described in a generic approach in [i10].\n\
    \   The approach is capable of being parameterized for various purposes\n   with\
    \ the intent of defining a flexible, customizable definition that\n   can be applied\
    \ to a wide range of applications and further\n   experimentation.  Other approaches\
    \ to characterizing jitter behavior\n   are also captured such as in [i12].  A\
    \ wide-ranging report format\n   [i11] has been described to convey information\
    \ including jitter for\n   use with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [i12].  The\
    \ MDI is instead\n   intended to specifically address the need for a scalable,\n\
    \   economical-to-compute metric that characterizes network impairments\n   that\
    \ may be imposed on streaming media, independent of control plane\n   or measurement\
    \ transport protocol or stream encapsulation protocol.\n   It is a targeted metric\
    \ for use in production networks carrying large\n   numbers of streams for the\
    \ purpose of monitoring the network quality\n   of the flows or for other applications\
    \ intended to analyze large\n   numbers of streams susceptible to IP network device\
    \ impairments.  An\n   example application is the burgeoning deployments of Internet\n\
    \   Protocol Television (IPTV) by cable and telecommunication service\n   providers.\
    \  As described below, MDI provides for a readily scalable\n   per-stream measure\
    \ focused on loss and the cumulative effects of\n   jitter.\n"
- title: 2.  Media Delivery Index Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  Media Delivery Index Overview\n   The MDI provides a relative indicator of\
    \ needed buffer depths at the\n   consumer node due to packet jitter as well as\
    \ an indication of lost\n   packets.  By probing a streaming media service network\
    \ at various\n   nodes and under varying load conditions, it is possible to quickly\n\
    \   identify devices or locales that introduce significant jitter or\n   packet\
    \ loss to the packet stream.  By monitoring a network\n   continuously, deviations\
    \ from nominal jitter or loss behavior can be\n   used to indicate an impending\
    \ or ongoing fault condition such as\n   excessive load.  It is believed that\
    \ the MDI provides the necessary\n   information to detect all network-induced\
    \ impairments for streaming\n   video or voice-over-IP applications.  Other parameters\
    \ may be\n   required to troubleshoot and correct the impairments.\n   The MDI\
    \ is updated at the termination of selected time intervals\n   spanning multiple\
    \ packets that contain the streaming media (such as\n   transport stream packets\
    \ in the MPEG-2 case).  The Maximums and\n   Minimums of the MDI component values\
    \ are captured over a measurement\n   time.  The measurement time may range from\
    \ just long enough to\n   capture an anticipated network anomaly during a troubleshooting\n\
    \   exercise to indefinitely long for a long-term monitoring or logging\n   application.\
    \  The Maximums and Minimums may be obtained by sampling\n   the measurement with\
    \ adequate frequency.\n"
- title: 3.  Media Delivery Index Components
  contents:
  - "3.  Media Delivery Index Components\n   The MDI consists of two components: \
    \ the Delay Factor (DF) and the\n   Media Loss Rate (MLR).\n"
- title: 3.1.  Delay Factor
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Delay Factor\n   The Delay Factor is the maximum difference, observed at\
    \ the end of\n   each media stream packet, between the arrival of media data and\
    \ the\n   drain of media data.  This assumes the drain rate is the nominal\n \
    \  constant traffic rate for constant bit rate streams or the piece-wise\n   computed\
    \ traffic rate of variable rate media stream packet data.  The\n   \"drain rate\"\
    \ here refers to the payload media rate; e.g., for a\n   typical 3.75 Mb/s MPEG\
    \ video Transport Stream (TS), the drain rate is\n   3.75 Mb/s -- the rate at\
    \ which the payload is consumed (displayed) at\n   a decoding node.  If, at the\
    \ sample time, the number of bytes\n   received equals the number transmitted,\
    \ the instantaneous flow rate\n   balance will be zero; however, the minimum DF\
    \ will be a line packet's\n   worth of media data, as that is the minimum amount\
    \ of data that must\n   be buffered.\n   The DF is the maximum observed value\
    \ of the flow rate imbalance over\n   a calculation interval.  This buffered media\
    \ data in bytes is\n   expressed in terms of how long, in milliseconds, it would\
    \ take to\n   drain (or fill) this data at the nominal traffic rate to obtain\
    \ the\n   DF.  Display of DF with a resolution of tenths of milliseconds is\n\
    \   recommended to provide adequate indication of stream variations for\n   monitoring\
    \ and diagnostic applications for typical stream rates from\n   1 to 40 Mb/s.\
    \  The DF value must be updated and displayed at the end\n   of a selected time\
    \ interval.  The selected time interval is chosen to\n   be long enough to sample\
    \ a number of TS packets and will, therefore,\n   vary based on the nominal traffic\
    \ rate.  For typical stream rates of\n   1 Mb/s and up, an interval of 1 second\
    \ provides a long enough sample\n   time and should be included for all implementations.\
    \  The Delay\n   Factor indicates how long a data stream must be buffered (i.e.,\n\
    \   delayed) at its nominal bit rate to prevent packet loss.  This time\n   may\
    \ also be seen as a measure of the network latency that must be\n   induced from\
    \ buffering, which is required to accommodate stream\n   jitter and prevent loss.\
    \  The DF`s max and min over the measurement\n   period (multiple intervals) may\
    \ also be displayed to show the worst\n   case arrival time deviation, or jitter,\
    \ relative to the nominal\n   traffic rate in a measurement period.  It provides\
    \ a dynamic flow\n   rate balance indication with its max and min showing the\
    \ worst\n   excursions from balance.\n   The Delay Factor gives a hint of the\
    \ minimum size of the buffer\n   required at the next downstream node.  As a stream\
    \ progresses, the\n   variation of the Delay Factor indicates packet bunching\
    \ or packet\n   gaps (jitter).  Greater DF values also indicate that more network\n\
    \   latency is necessary to deliver a stream due to the need to pre-fill\n   a\
    \ receive buffer before beginning the drain to guarantee no\n   underflow.  The\
    \ DF comprises a fixed part based on packet size and a\n   variable part based\
    \ on the buffer utilization of the various network\n   component switch elements\
    \ that comprise the switched network\n   infrastructure [i2].\n   To further detail\
    \ the calculation of DF, consider a virtual buffer VB\n   used to buffer received\
    \ packets of a stream.  When a packet P(i)\n   arrives during a calculation interval,\
    \ compute two VB values,\n   VB(i,pre) and VB(i,post), defined as:\n   VB(i,pre)\
    \ = sum (Sj) - MR * Ti; where j=1..i-1\n   VB(i,post) = VB(i,pre) + Si\n   where\
    \ Sj is the media payload size of the jth packet, Ti is the\n   relative time\
    \ at which packet i arrives in the interval, and MR is\n   the nominal media rate.\n\
    \   VB(i,pre) is the Virtual Buffer size just before the arrival of P(i).\n  \
    \ VB(i,post) is the Virtual Buffer size just after the arrival of P(i).\n   The\
    \ initial condition of VB(0) = 0 is used at the beginning of each\n   measurement\
    \ interval.  A measurement interval is defined from just\n   after the time of\
    \ arrival of the last packet during a nominal period\n   (typically 1 second)\
    \ as mentioned above to the time just after the\n   arrival of the last packet\
    \ of the next nominal period.\n   During a measurement interval, if k packets\
    \ are received, then there\n   are 2*k+1 VB values used in deriving VB(max) and\
    \ VB(min).  After\n   determining VB(max) and VB(min) from the 2k+1 VB samples,\
    \ DF for the\n   measurement interval is computed and displayed as:\n   DF = [VB(max)\
    \ - VB(min)]/ MR\n   As noted above, a measurement interval of 1 second is typically\
    \ used.\n   If no packets are received during an interval, the last DF calculated\n\
    \   during an interval in which packets did arrive is displayed.  The\n   time\
    \ of arrival of the last previous packet is always retained for\n   use in calculating\
    \ VB when the next packet arrives (even if the time\n   of the last received packet\
    \ spans measurement intervals).  For the\n   first received measurement interval\
    \ of a measurement period, no DF is\n   calculated; however, packet arrival times\
    \ are recorded for use in\n   calculating VB during the following interval.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Media Loss Rate
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Media Loss Rate\n   The Media Loss Rate is the count of lost or out-of-order\
    \ flow packets\n   over a selected time interval, where the flow packets are packets\n\
    \   carrying streaming application information.  There may be zero or\n   more\
    \ streaming packets in a single IP packet.  For example, it is\n   common to carry\
    \ seven 188 Byte MPEG Transport Stream packets in an IP\n   packet.  In such a\
    \ case, a single IP packet loss would result in 7\n   lost packets counted (if\
    \ those 7 lost packets did not include null\n   packets).  Including out-of-order\
    \ packets is important, as many\n   stream consumer-type devices do not attempt\
    \ to reorder packets that\n   are received out of order.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Media Delivery Index
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Media Delivery Index\n   Combining the Delay Factor and Media Loss Rate\
    \ quantities for\n   presentation results in the following MDI:\n            \
    \                      DF:MLR\n    Where:\n                          DF is the\
    \ Delay Factor\n                        MLR is the Media Loss Rate\n   At a receiving\
    \ node, knowing its nominal drain bit rate, the DF`s max\n   indicates the size\
    \ of buffer required to accommodate packet jitter.\n   Or, in terms of Leaky Bucket\
    \ [i9] parameters, DF indicates bucket\n   size b, expressed in time to transmit\
    \ bucket traffic b, at the given\n   nominal traffic rate, r.\n"
- title: 3.4.  MDI Application Examples
  contents:
  - "3.4.  MDI Application Examples\n   If a known, well-characterized receive node\
    \ is separated from the\n   data source by unknown or less well-characterized\
    \ nodes such as\n   intermediate switch nodes, the MDI measured at intermediate\
    \ data\n   links provides a relative indication of the behavior of upstream\n\
    \   traffic flows.  DF difference indications between one node and\n   another\
    \ in a data stream for a given constant interval of calculation\n   can indicate\
    \ local areas of traffic congestion or possibly\n   misconfigured QoS flow specification(s)\
    \ leading to greater filling of\n   measurement point local device buffers, resultant\
    \ flow rate\n   deviations, and possible data loss.\n   For a given MDI, if DF\
    \ is high and/or the DF Max-Min captured over a\n   significant measurement period\
    \ of multiple intervals is high, jitter\n   has been detected but the longer-term,\
    \ average flow rate may be\n   nominal.  This could be the result of a transient\
    \ flow upset due to a\n   coincident traffic stream unrelated to the flow of interest\
    \ causing\n   packet bunching.  A high DF may cause downstream buffer overflow\
    \ or\n   underflow or unacceptable latency even in the absence of lost data.\n\
    \   Due to transient network failures or DF excursions, packets may be\n   lost\
    \ within the network.  The MLR component of the MDI shows this\n   condition.\n\
    \   Through automated or manual flow detection and identification and\n   subsequent\
    \ MDI calculations for real-time statistics on a flow, the\n   DF can indicate\
    \ the dynamic deterioration or increasing burstiness of\n   a flow, which can\
    \ be used to anticipate a developing network\n   operation problem such as transient\
    \ oversubscription.  Such\n   statistics can be obtained for flows within network\
    \ switches using\n   available switch cpu resources due to the minimal computational\n\
    \   requirements needed for small numbers of flows.  Statistics for all\n   flows\
    \ present on, say, a gigabit Ethernet network, will likely\n   require dedicated\
    \ hardware facilities, though these can be modest, as\n   buffer requirements\
    \ and the required calculations per flow are\n   minimal.  By equipping network\
    \ switches with MDI measurements, flow\n   impairment issues can quickly be identified,\
    \ localized, and\n   corrected.  Until switches are so equipped with appropriate\
    \ hardware\n   resources, dedicated hardware tools can provide supplemental switch\n\
    \   statistics by gaining access to switch flows via mirror ports, link\n   taps,\
    \ or the like as a transition strategy.\n   The MDI figure can also be used to\
    \ characterize a flow decoder's\n   acceptable performance.  For example, an MPEG\
    \ decoder could be\n   characterized as tolerating a flow with a given maximum\
    \ DF and MLR\n   for acceptable display performance (acceptable on-screen artifacts).\n\
    \   Network conditions such as Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)\n   reconvergence\
    \ time then might also be included in the flow tolerance\n   DF resulting in a\
    \ higher-quality user experience.\n"
