Abstract This document defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module for configuring and managing the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).
The OLSRv2 MIB module is structured into configuration information, state information, performance information, and notifications.
This additional state and performance information is useful for troubleshooting problems and performance issues of the routing protocol.
Two levels of compliance allow this MIB module to be deployed on constrained routers.
This document defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module for configuring and managing the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).
The OLSRv2 MIB module is structured into configuration information, state information, performance information, and notifications.
In addition to configuration, this additional state and performance information is useful for troubleshooting problems and performance issues of the routing protocol.
Different levels of compliance allow implementers to use smaller subsets of all defined objects, allowing for this MIB module to be deployed on more constrained routers.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7 of [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB module are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This document specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, [RFC2578], STD 58, [RFC2579] and STD 58 [RFC2580].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2)
[RFC7181] is a table driven, proactive routing protocol, i.e., it exchanges topology information with other routers in the network periodically.
OLSRv2 is an optimization of the classical link state routing protocol.
Its key concept is that of multipoint relays (MPRs).
Each router selects a set of its neighbor routers (which "cover" all of its symmetrically connected 2 hop neighbor routers) as MPRs.
MPRs are then used to achieve both flooding reduction and topology reduction.
This document provides management and control capabilities of an OLSRv2 instance, allowing management applications to monitor the state and performance of an OLSRv2 router, as well as to change settings of the OLSRv2 instance (e.g., router or interface parameters such as message intervals, etc.).
As OLSRv2 relies on the neighborhood information discovered by the "Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)" [RFC6130], the OLSRv2 MIB module is aligned with the NHDP MIB module [RFC6779] and augments several of the tables and objects in the NHDP MIB.
In particular, common indexes for router interfaces and discovered neighbors are used, as described in Section 5.2.
The following definitions apply throughout this document:  Configuration Objects switches, tables, and objects that are initialized to default settings or set through the management interface defined by this MIB module.
State Objects automatically generated values that define the current operating state of the OLSRv2 protocol instance in the router.
Performance Objects automatically generated values that help an administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the OLSRv2 process on the router.
Notification Objects objects that define triggers and associated notification messages allowing for asynchronous tracking of predefined events on the managed router.
Structure of the MIB Module
This section presents the structure of the OLSRv2 MIB module.
The objects are arranged into the following structure:  olsrv2MIBObjects defines objects forming the basis for the OLSRv2 MIB module.
These objects are divided up by function into the following groups:
Configuration Group defining objects related to the configuration of the OLSRv2 instance on the router.
State Group defining objects that reflect the current state of the OLSRv2 instance running on the router.
Performance Group defining objects that are useful to a management system when characterizing the performance of OLSRv2 on the router and in the MANET.
olsrv2MIBNotifications objects defining OLSRv2 MIB module notifications.
defining the minimal and maximal conformance requirements for implementations of this MIB module.
The OLSRv2 router is configured with a set of controls.
The authoritative list of configuration controls within the OLSRv2 MIB module is found within the MIB module itself.
Generally, an attempt was made in developing the OLSRv2 MIB module to support all configuration objects defined in [RFC7181].
For all of the configuration parameters, the same constraints and default values of these parameters as defined in [RFC7181] are followed.
The State Group reports current state information of a router running [RFC7181].
The OLSRv2 MIB module State Group tables were designed to contain the complete set of state information defined within the Information Bases in [RFC7181].
The OLSRv2 MIB module State Group tables are constructed as extensions to the corresponding tables within the State Group of the NHDP
Use of the AUGMENTS clause is made, when possible, to accomplish these table extensions.
Further, the State Group tables defined in this MIB module are aligned with the corresponding tables in the NHDP
MIB module [RFC6779], as described in Section 6.2.
The Performance Group reports values relevant to system performance.
Frequent changes of sets or frequent recalculation of the Routing Set or the MPRs can have a negative influence on the performance of OLSRv2.
This MIB module defines several objects that can be polled, e.g., in order to calculate histories or monitor frequencies of changes.
This may help the network administrator to determine unusual topology changes or other changes that affect stability and reliability of the MANET.
One such framework is specified in REPORT  MIB [REPORT MIB].
The Notifications Group The Notifications Group contains Control (olsrv2NotificationsControl), Objects (olsrv2NotificationsObjects), and States (olsrv2NotificationsStates), where the Control contains definitions of objects to control the frequency of notifications being generated.
The Objects define the supported notifications, and the State is used to define additional information to be carried within the notifications.
The olsrv2NotificationsObjects sub tree contains the list of notifications supported within the OLSRv2 MIB module and their intended purpose or utility.
The same mechanisms for improving the network performance by reducing the number of notifications apply as defined in Section 5.1 of [RFC6779].
The following objects are used to define the thresholds and time windows for specific notifications defined in the NHDP MIB module: olsrv2RoutingSetRecalculationCountThreshold, olsrv2RoutingSetRecalculationCountWindow, olsrv2MPRSetRecalculationCountThreshold, and olsrv2MPRSetRecalculationCountWindow.
Tables and Indexing The OLSRv2
MIB module's tables are indexed by the following constructs:  nhdpIfIndex
the ifIndex of the local router on which NHDP is configured.
This is defined in the NHDP MIB.
nhdpDiscIfIndex a locally managed index representing a known interface on a neighboring router.
This is defined in the NHDP  MIB.
nhdpDiscRouterIndex a locally managed index representing an ID of a known neighboring router.
This is defined in the NHDP MIB.
{olsrv2LibOrigSetIpAddrType, olsrv2LibOrigSetIpAddr} this index (pair) uniquely identifies recently used originator addresses found within the olsrv2LibOrigSetTable.
{olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetIpAddrType, olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetIpAddr, olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetIpAddrPrefixLen} this index (triplet) uniquely identifies local attached networks reachable through local (non OLSRv2)
These are recorded in the olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetTable.
this index (pair) uniquely identifies each router in the network that transmits Topology Control (TC) messages received by this router.
These records are recorded in the olsrv2TibAdRemoteRouterSetIpAddr.
{olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetFromOrigIpAddrType, olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetFromOrigIpAddr, olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetToOrigIpAddrType, olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetToOrigIpAddr} this index (quadruplet) uniquely identifies discovered links within the network recorded by this router.
Information associated with each link is stored in the olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetTable.
{olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetFromOrigIpAddrType, olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetFromOrigIpAddr, olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetFromDestIpAddrType, olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetFromDestIpAddr} this index (quadruplet) uniquely identifies reachable addresses within the network and the router's advertising of these addresses.
This information is stored in the olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetTable.
{olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetOrigIpAddrType, olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetOrigIpAddr, olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetNetIpAddrType, olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetNetIpAddr, olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetNetIpAddrPrefixLen}
this index (quintuplet) uniquely identifies the networks (which may be outside the MANET) and the routers through which these networks can be reached.
This information is stored in the olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetTable.
this index (triplet) uniquely identifies the address of a reachable destination in the network.
This indexes the olsrv2TibRoutingSetTable, which contains the next hop information to reach the indexed addresses.
These tables and their indexing are:  olsrv2InterfaceTable describes the OLSRv2 status on the NHDP interfaces of this router.
This table augments nhdpInterfaceEntry and, as such, it is indexed by the {nhdpIfIndex} from the NHDP  MIB.
olsrv2IibLinkSetTable records all links from other routers that are, or recently were, 1 hop neighbors.
and, as such, it is indexed by nhdpIfIndex and nhdpDiscIfIndex.
olsrv2Iib2HopSetTable records network addresses of symmetric 2 hop neighbors and the links to the associated 1 hop neighbors.
and, as such, it is indexed by {nhdpIfIndex, nhdpDiscIfIndex, nhdpIib2HopSetIpAddressType, nhdpIib2HopSetIpAddress}.
olsrv2LibOrigSetTable records addresses that were recently used as originator addresses by this router.
This table is indexed by {olsrv2LibOrigSetIpAddrType, olsrv2LibOrigSetIpAddr}.
olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetTable records its local non OLSRv2 interfaces via which it can act as a gateway to other networks.
This table is indexed by {olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetIpAddrType, olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetIpAddr, olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetIpAddrPrefixLen}.
olsrv2NibNeighborSetTable records all network addresses of each 1 hop neighbor.
This table augments nhdpNibNeighborSetEntry and, as such, it is indexed by the {nhdpDiscRouterIndex}.

olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetTable records topology information about the routable addresses within the MANET and via which routers they may be reached.
This table is indexed by {olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetFromOrigIpAddrType, olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetFromOrigIpAddr, olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetFromDestIpAddrType, olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetFromDestIpAddr}.
olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetTable records information about networks (which may be outside the MANET) attached to other routers and their routable addresses.
This table is indexed by {olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetOrigIpAddrType, olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetOrigIpAddr, olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetNetIpAddrType, olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetNetIpAddr, olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetNetIpAddrPrefixLen}.
olsrv2TibRoutingSetTable records the first hop along a selected path to each destination for which any such path is known.
This table is indexed by {olsrv2TibRoutingSetDestIpAddrType, olsrv2TibRoutingSetDestIpAddr, olsrv2TibRoutingSetDestIpAddrPrefixLen}.
olsrv2InterfacePerfTable records performance counters for each active OLSRv2 interface on this device.
This table augments nhdpInterfacePerfEntry and, as such, it is indexed by {nhdpIfIndex} from the NHDP MIB.
Relationship to Other MIB Modules
This section specifies the relationship of the MIB modules contained in this document to other standards, particularly to standards containing other MIB modules.
MIB modules and specific definitions imported from MIB modules that SHOULD be implemented in conjunction with the MIB module contained within this document are identified in this section.
Relationship to the SNMPv2 MIB
The System group in the SNMPv2 MIB module [RFC3418] is defined as being mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a whole.
The System group provides identification of the management entity and certain other system wide data.
The OLSRv2 MIB module does not duplicate those objects.
Relationship to the NHDP MIB OLSRv2 depends on the neighborhood information that is discovered by [RFC6130].
An instance of OLSRv2 MUST have an associated instance of NHDP running on the same device for proper operations of the discovery and routing system.
In order for the OLSRv2 MIB module to correctly populate the objects relating to discovered neighbors, the State Group tables of the NHDP MIB module [RFC6779] are aligned with the State Group tables of this MIB module.
This is accomplished through the use of the AUGMENTS capability of SMIv2 (where appropriate).
This will allow for cross referencing of information between the two MIB modules within a given SNMP context.
MIB Modules Required for IMPORTS The following OLSRv2 MIB module IMPORTS objects from NHDP MIB [RFC6779],
CONF [RFC2580], IF MIB [RFC2863], and INET ADDRESS MIB [RFC4001].
The OLSRv2 MIB module also IMPORTS objects from the IANAolsrv2LinkMetricType MIB, which is available at <http:// www.iana.org/assignments/ianaolsrv2linkmetrictype mib>. 7.

This OLSRv2 MIB module is applicable to routers implementing the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) defined in RFC 7181.

This version of this MIB module is part of RFC 7184; see the RFC itself for full legal notices."
Metrics are expressed in terms of a Link Metric Compressed Form within the OLSRv2 protocol.
This textual convention defines the syntax of the metric objects consistent with the definitions of the OLSRv2 Link Metric Compressed Form in Section 6.2 of RFC 7181.
The 12 bit compressed form of a link metric uses a modified form of a representation with an 8 bit mantissa (denoted a) and a 4 bit exponent (denoted b).
Note that if represented as the 12 bit value 256b a, then the ordering of those 12 bit values is identical to the ordering of the represented values.
The value so represented is (257 a)2^b 256, where ^ denotes exponentiation.
This has a minimum value (when a   0 and b   0) of MINIMUM
METRIC   1 and a maximum value (when a   255 and b   15) of MAXIMUM
Hence, the metric values so represented range from 1 to 16776960.
The special value of 0 is reserved for the UNKNOWN METRIC value.
If a network manager sets the metric value 'm' through the MIB module, then the OLSRv2 code can both use this value and derive a compressed representation of 'm' (as used in messages) as specified in Section 6.2 of RFC7181.
The value 'm' is persistently stored by the MIB module.
If the MIB module is pulling this metric's value from some other source, e.g., the protocol instance, then this value is stored as is.
"OLSRv2 time values may be expressed in terms of a compressed form within the OLSRv2 protocol.
This textual convention defines the syntax of the time objects defined in terms of an integer number of milliseconds, consistent with the definitions of the 8 bit exponent mantissa compressed form defined in Section 5 of RFC 5497.
Time values with this representation are defined in terms of a constant C, which is represented in terms of seconds.
The constant C (time granularity) is used as specified in RFC 5497.
It MUST be the same as is used by NHDP (RFC 6130).
The 8 bit compressed form of a time value uses a modified form of a representation with a 3 bit mantissa (denoted a) and a 5 bit exponent (denoted b).
Note that if represented as the 8 bit value 8b a, then the ordering of those 8 bit values is identical to the ordering of the represented values.
The minimum time value that can be represented in this manner is C.
The maximum time value that can be represented in this manner is 15
28   C, 15 268,435,456   C, 4,026,531,840   C, or
about 45 days if, for example, C   1/1024 second.
This TEXTUAL CONVENTION limits the maximum value of the time granularity constant C to be no greater than 1/1024 seconds due to its use of the Unsigned32 syntax limiting the maximum number of milliseconds to no more than 3932160000.
When OLSRv2 uses this 8 bit exponent mantissa compressed form, this object value MUST be translated from the integer form represented in this MIB module into the exponent mantissa form for the OLSRv2 protocol to use according to the algorithm defined in Section 5 of RFC 5497 for finding the next larger time value within the exponent mantissa format.
If a network manager sets the time value 't' through the MIB module, then the OLSRv2 code can derive 'compressed t'   T(a,b) according to the algorithm in RFC 5497 and 'compressed t'
is the value represented in the OLSRv2 messages.
But, the value 't' is persistently stored by the MIB module.
If the MIB module is pulling this time parameter from some other source that is using the compressed form, i.e., the protocol instance, then this value is stored as is, after converting from number of time constants C into number of milliseconds."
Controls the operation of the OLSRv2 protocol on the device or a specific interface.
For example, for an interface, 'enabled' indicates that OLSRv2 is permitted to operate, and 'disabled' indicates that it is not."
"A willingness value that evaluates to the device's interest in participating in a particular function, process, or behavior.
The willingness ranges from a low value of WILL NEVER(0) to a high value of WILL ALWAYS(15).
x, there is an associated willingness value W(x)
such that WILL NEVER < W(x)
The configured status of the OLSRv2 process on this device.
'enabled(1)' means that OLSRv2 is configured to run on this device. '
disabled(2)' mean that the OLSRv2 process is configured off.
Operation of the OLSRv2 protocol requires the operation of the Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (RFC 6130).
Hence, this object cannot have a status of 'enabled' unless at least one interface on the device is a MANET interface with NHDP enabled on that interface.
If a network manager attempts to set this object to 'enabled' when no interfaces on this device have NHDP enabled, the device MUST fail the set with inconsistentValue.
If all device interfaces running NHDP become disabled or removed, then the olsrv2AdminStatus MUST be 'disabled'.
If the network manager, or other means, sets this object to 'disabled', then the associated interface specific objects, i.e., the olsrv2InterfaceAdminStatus objects MUST all be 'disabled'.
This object is persistent, and when written, the entity SHOULD save the change to non volatile storage.
SEQUENCE OF Olsrv2InterfaceEntry MAX ACCESS
The olsrv2InterfaceTable describes the OLSRv2 status on the NHDP interfaces of this router.
As such, this table augments the nhdpInterfaceTable defined in the NHDP MIB (RFC 6779).
NHDP interfaces are explicitly defined by network management, command line interface (CLI) or other means for interfaces on the device that are intended to run MANET protocols.
The olsrv2InterfaceTable contains a single object: the olsrv2InterfaceAdminStatus object.
This object is set by network management, or by other means, e.g., CLI.
A conceptual row in this table exists if and only if a corresponding entry in the nhdpInterfaceTable exists.
If the corresponding entry with nhdpIfIndex value is deleted from the nhdpInterfaceTable, then the entry in this table is automatically deleted and OLSRv2 is disabled on this interface, and all configuration and state information related to this interface is to be removed from memory.
The olsrv2InterfaceAdminStatus can only be 'enabled' if the corresponding olsrv2AdminStatus object is also set to 'enabled'."

The AN orig addr is defined by the tuple (olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetOrigIpAddrType, olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetOrigIpAddr).
Sequence numbers are used in the OLSRv2 protocol for the purpose of discarding 'old' information, i.e., messages received out of order.
However, with a limited number of bits for representing sequence numbers, wraparound (that the sequence number is incremented from the maximum possible value to zero) will occur.
To prevent this from interfering with the operation of this protocol, the following MUST be observed when determining the ordering of sequence numbers.
The term MAXVALUE designates in the following one more than the largest possible value for a sequence number.
For a 16 bit sequence number (as are those defined in this specification), MAXVALUE is 65536.
The sequence number S1 is said to be 'greater than' the sequence number S2 if:  S1 > S2 AND S1 S2 < MAXVALUE/2
When sequence numbers S1 and S2 differ by MAXVALUE/2, their ordering cannot be determined.
In this case, which should not occur, either ordering may be assumed.
Thus, when comparing two messages, it is possible even in the presence of wraparound to determine which message contains the most recent information."

Notification types to support management of OLSRv2.
This MIB module defines objects for the configuration, monitoring, and notification of the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2)
OLSRv2 allows routers to acquire topological information of the routing domain by exchanging TC messages in order to calculate shortest paths to each destination router in the routing domain.
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
these writable objects control the rate at which TC messages are sent.
If set at too high a rate, this could represent a form of a DoS attack by overloading interface resources.
If set too low, OLSRv2 may not converge fast enough to provide accurate routes to all destinations in the routing domain.
olsrv2TcHopLimit defines the hop limit for TC messages.
If set too low, messages will not be forwarded beyond the defined scope; thus, routers further away from the message originator will not be able to construct appropriate topology graphs.
olsrv2OHoldTime, olsrv2THoldTime, olsrv2AHoldTime, olsrv2RxHoldTime, olsrv2PHoldTime
, olsrv2FHoldTime define hold times for tuples of different Information Bases of OLSRv2.
If set too low, information will expire quickly, and may this harm a correct operation of the routing protocol.
olsrv2WillFlooding and olsrv2WillRouting define the willingness of this router to become MPR.
If this is set to WILL NEVER (0), the managed router will not forward any TC messages, nor accept a selection to become MPR by neighboring routers.
If set to WILL ALWAYS (15), the router will be preferred by neighbors during MPR selection and may thus attract more traffic.
olsrv2TpMaxJitter, olsrv2TtMaxJitter, olsrv2FMaxJitter define jitter values for TC message transmission and forwarding.
If set too low, control traffic may get lost when collisions occur.
olsrv2LinkMetricType defines the type of the link metric that a router uses (e.g., ETX or hop count).
Whenever this value changes, all link metric information recorded by the router is invalid, causing a reset of information acquired from other routers in the MANET.
Moreover, if olsrv2LinkMetricType on a router is set to a value that is not known to other routers in the MANET, these routers will not be able to establish routes to that router or transiting that router.
Existing routes to the router with an olsrv2LinkMetricType unknown to other routers in the MANET will be removed.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
The contains information on the topology of the MANET, specifically the IP address of the routers in the MANET (as identified by olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetFromOrigIpAddr and olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetToOrigIpAddr objects).
This information provides an adversary broad information on the members of the MANET, located within this single table.
This information can be used to expedite attacks on the other members of the MANET without having to go through a laborious discovery process on their own.
Some of the Tables in this MIB module
AUGMENT Tables defined in NHDP
Hence, care must be taken in configuring access control here in order make sure that the permitted permissions granted for the AUGMENTing Tables here are consistent with the access controls permitted within the NHDP MIB.
The below list identifies the AUGMENTing Tables and their NHDP MIB counterparts.
It is RECOMMENDED that access control policies for these Table pairs are consistently set.
The olsrv2InterfaceTable AUGMENTs the nhdpInterfaceTable.
The olsrv2Iib2HopSetTable AUGMENTs the nhdpIib2HopSetTable.
The olsrv2NibNeighborSetTable AUGMENTs the nhdpNibNeighborSetTable.
The olsrv2InterfacePerfTable AUGMENTs the nhdpInterfacePerfTable.
MANET technology is often deployed to support communications of emergency services or military tactical applications.
In these applications, it is imperative to maintain the proper operation of the communications network and to protect sensitive information related to its operation.
Therefore, when implementing these capabilities, the full use of SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms for authentication and privacy is RECOMMENDED.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for authentication and privacy via the User based Security Model (USM)
[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
Applicability Statement This document describes objects for configuring parameters of the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2)
[RFC7181] process on a router.
This MIB module, denoted OLSRv2 MIB, also reports state, performance information, and notifications.
The OLSRv2 protocol relies upon information gathered via the Neighborhood Discovery Protocol [RFC6130] in order to perform its operations.
NHDP is managed via the NHDP MIB [RFC6779].
MANET deployments can greatly differ in aspects of dynamics of the topology, capacity, and loss rates of underlying channels, traffic flow directions, memory and CPU capacity of routers, etc.
SNMP, and therefore this MIB module, are only applicable for a subset of MANET deployments, in particular deployments:  In which routers have enough memory and CPU resources to run SNMP and expose the MIB module.
Where a Network Management System (NMS) is defined to which notifications are generated and from which routers can be managed.
Where this NMS is reachable from routers in the MANET most of the time (as notifications to the NMS and management information from the NMS to the router will be lost when connectivity is temporarily lost).
This requires that the topology of the MANET is only moderately dynamic.
Where the underlying wireless channel supports enough bandwidth to run SNMP, and where loss rates of the channel are not exhaustive.
Certain MANET deployments such as community networks with non mobile routers, dynamic topology because of changing link quality, and a predefined gateway (that could also serve as NMS), are examples of networks applicable for this MIB module.
Other, more constrained deployments of MANETs may not be able to run SNMP and require different management protocols.
Some level of configuration, i.e., read write objects, is desirable for OLSRv2 deployments.
Topology related configuration, such as the ability to enable OLSRv2 on new interfaces or initially configure OLSRv2 on a router's interfaces through the olsrv2InterfaceAdminStatus object, is critical to initial system startup.
The OLSRv2 protocol allows for some level of performance tuning through various protocol parameters, and this MIB module allows for configuration of those protocol parameters through read  write objects such as the olsrv2TcHopLimit or the olsrv2FMaxJitter.
Other read write objects allow for the control of Notification behavior through this MIB module, e.g., the olsrv2RoutingSetRecalculationCountThreshold object.
A fuller discussion of MANET network management applicability is to be provided elsewhere:
[MGMT SNAP] provides a snapshot of OLSRv2 routed MANET management as currently deployed, while [MANET MGMT] is intended to provide specific guidelines on MANET network management considering the various MIB modules that have been written.
