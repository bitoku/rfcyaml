- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   It has been well known within the Internet research and\
    \ engineering\n   community that many installed systems in the Internet query\
    \ the\n   domain name system (DNS) root for names under a wide range of top-\n\
    \   level domains (TLDs).  Many of these TLDs are not delegated, which\n   results\
    \ in a response indicating that the name queried does not exist\n   (commonly\
    \ called an NXDOMAIN response [RFC7719]).  In the Internet\n   Corporation for\
    \ Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) community, it was\n   observed as early as\
    \ November 2010 by the Security and Stability\n   Advisory Committee (SSAC) report\
    \ [SAC045] that the addition of new\n   TLDs in the DNS root could result in so-called\
    \ name collisions for\n   names used in environments other than the global Internet.\
    \  Some\n   installed systems, following established (albeit not vetted)\n   operational\
    \ practices, generate queries to the global DNS with name\n   suffixes that, under\
    \ seemingly reasonable assumptions at the time the\n   systems were designed or\
    \ configured, were not expected to be\n   delegated as TLDs.  Many of these installed\
    \ systems depend explicitly\n   or implicitly on the indication from the global\
    \ DNS that the domain\n   name suffix does not exist.  After a new TLD is delegated,\
    \ the global\n   DNS may give a different response to the query involving the\
    \ TLD than\n   it did prior to the TLD's delegation.\n   A name collision occurs\
    \ when an attempt to resolve a name used in a\n   private namespace results in\
    \ a query to the public DNS, and the\n   response indicates that the name is in\
    \ the global DNS [NCRI].  In\n   other words, the overlap of public and private\
    \ namespaces may result\n   in potential unintended (and, therefore, potentially\
    \ harmful)\n   resolution results.  The impact of the global change on installed\n\
    \   systems will be varied; risks to installed systems introduced by name\n  \
    \ collisions may arise due to varied causes.\n   In a globally distributed system,\
    \ such as the Internet, it is\n   difficult, yet critical, to agree on policies\
    \ for demarking\n   boundaries of ownership and autonomy.  Name space governance\
    \ is\n   critical to ensure predictable use of names in the global DNS.\n   In\
    \ order to help ensure this uniqueness and interoperability, ICANN,\n   through\
    \ its coordination of the IANA functions, is responsible for\n   administration\
    \ of certain responsibilities associated with Internet\n   DNS root zone management,\
    \ such as generic and country code Top-Level\n   Domains (gTLDs and ccTLDs). \
    \ Prior to ICANN's creation in 1998, seven\n   generic TLDs were defined in the\
    \ early development of the Internet\n   [RFC1591].  Since the formation of ICANN,\
    \ the delegations of generic,\n   internationalized and country code TLDs have\
    \ been administered and\n   delegated by ICANN.  During these delegations, it\
    \ quickly became\n   apparent within the IETF community that there was a need\
    \ to reserve\n   name spaces that can be used for creating limited sets of internal\n\
    \   names without fear of conflicts with current or future TLD name\n   spaces\
    \ in the global DNS [RFC2606].\n   While the reserved TLDs [RFC2606] aimed to\
    \ enable operators to use\n   them only as a small set of reserved names internally,\
    \ with limited\n   uses, educational awareness and operational best practices\
    \ did not\n   achieve the goal of reserving special-use domain names [RFC6761];\n\
    \   other suffixes, not reserved though at the time not in conflict, were\n  \
    \ often employed instead.  Faulty assumptions, or encouragement in some\n   cases\
    \ by vendor documentation, of \"we only use this name internally\n   and there\
    \ is no possibility of leakage to the global DNS\" were made\n   by numerous operators\
    \ or administrators.  Numerous reports and\n   findings have clearly disproved\
    \ these faulty assumptions by showing\n   substantial \"DNS leakage\" into the\
    \ global DNS through mechanisms such\n   as search lists.\n   In 2012, ICANN created\
    \ a new gTLD program to add a potentially\n   unlimited number of new gTLDs to\
    \ the root zone as a mechanism to\n   enhance competition, innovation, and consumer\
    \ choice.  With the\n   potential of many new gTLDs becoming delegated in the\
    \ global DNS,\n   operators or administrators who elected to use a non-delegated\
    \ name\n   space internally may face potential \"name collision\" problems.\n\
    \   This document is primarily a report on the March 2014 workshop that\n   set\
    \ out to examine the causes and mitigation of such name collisions\n   and their\
    \ associated risks.  It is a companion to the Workshop and\n   Prize on Root Causes\
    \ and Mitigation of Name Collisions proceedings\n   [WPNC], and it also provides\
    \ some additional background and context.\n"
- title: 2.  Background and Context
  contents:
  - "2.  Background and Context\n   When the workshop was convened, the context and\
    \ status of the work\n   around name collisions could be described as follows.\n\
    \   Since early 2008, there had been numerous lengthy discussions within\n   the\
    \ ICANN community about the ability of the DNS root to scale to\n   accommodate\
    \ new gTLDs and the impact of making those changes on the\n   DNS ecosystem. \
    \ In March 2008, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB)\n   observed that the introduction\
    \ of suffixes in use in a number of\n   environments could lead to instability\
    \ [IAB2008].  In December 2010,\n   the Security and Stability Advisory Committee\
    \ (SSAC) issued their\n   report on root scaling in which the committee formalized\
    \ several\n   recommendations based on \"actual measurement, monitoring, and data-\n\
    \   sharing capabilities of root zone performance\" to help determine the\n  \
    \ feasibility of root scaling [SAC046].  Separately, the Root Server\n   System\
    \ Advisory Committee [RSSAC] agreed in late 2010 on the need to\n   establish\
    \ standard metrics to be collected and reported by all\n   operators.  This effort\
    \ would provide the community with a baseline\n   measure of the entire root server\
    \ system's performance.  With such an\n   established baseline, any possible negative\
    \ effect from additional\n   TLDs within the root could potentially be identified.\
    \  In late 2012,\n   the ICANN Board affirmed the need to work with the root server\n\
    \   operators via RSSAC to complete the documentation of the interactions\n  \
    \ between ICANN and the root server operators with respect to root zone\n   scaling\
    \ [IR2012].\n   In March 2013, SSAC published an advisory titled \"SSAC Advisory\
    \ on\n   Internal Name Certificates,\" which identified a Certificate Authority\n\
    \   (CA) practice that, if widely exploited, \"could pose a significant\n   risk\
    \ to the privacy and integrity of secure Internet communications\"\n   [SAC057].\
    \  The ICANN Board acknowledged the issues identified in the\n   advisory report\
    \ on internal name certificates [SAC057] as part of a\n   more general category\
    \ of issues.  These issues included installed\n   systems utilizing a namespace\
    \ in a private network that includes a\n   non-delegated TLD that is later delegated\
    \ into the root.  In May\n   2013, the ICANN Board commissioned a study on the\
    \ use within private\n   name spaces of TLDs that are not currently delegated\
    \ at the root\n   level of the global DNS [ISTUDY].  This study was focused on\n\
    \   potential name collision events between applied-for new gTLDs and\n   non-delegated\
    \ TLDs potentially used in private namespaces.  The study\n   also examined the\
    \ potential possibility of name collisions arising\n   from the use of digital\
    \ certificates referenced in the SSAC report on\n   internal name certificates\
    \ [SAC057].\n   Between the RSSAC's and SSAC's advisory statements ([RSSAC] [SAC046])\n\
    \   and the ICANN commissioning of a study in May 2013, there was\n   significant\
    \ progress on establishing formalized, coordinated\n   monitoring and measurement\
    \ of the root.  RSSAC approached its\n   finalization of the specific metrics\
    \ that each root operator will\n   collect and initiated discussions about where\
    \ the operators will send\n   their data for analysis once collected.  To properly\
    \ gauge the risks\n   of new gTLD delegations to the root, an established baseline\
    \ of\n   normal performance of the system would be required to start\n   sufficiently\
    \ ahead of the new delegations.  The execution of these\n   RSSAC and SSAC recommendations\
    \ was timed poorly with the commissioned\n   study, resulting in a limited pool\
    \ of data repositories from which\n   any baseline and risk measurements could\
    \ be established.\n   It is common practice for each root operator to monitor\
    \ its own root\n   server, and some operators report the status and performance\
    \ of their\n   services publicly.  As of ICANN's study commissioned in May 2013\n\
    \   [ISTUDY], there was no mechanism in place to allow a detailed view of\n  \
    \ the entire root system, short of the annual \"Day in the Life\"\n   ([DITL])\
    \ data repository, which contains root DNS data over a short\n   coordinated time\
    \ period from a varying subset of root operators and\n   was intended to be used\
    \ for research purposes, not to provide overall\n   monitoring and an operational\
    \ view of system health.  Due to the lack\n   of a more comprehensive and desirable\
    \ data repository for baseline\n   and collision analysis DITL has become the\
    \ de facto referential\n   dataset for root traffic analysis.\n   The commissioned\
    \ study, conducted by the Interisle Consulting Group,\n   was published in August\
    \ of 2013.  Their report \"Name Collisions in\n   the DNS\" [INTERISLE], based\
    \ on [DITL] measurements, addressed name\n   collisions in the DNS and also recommended\
    \ options to mitigate the\n   various name collision risks.  The study identified\
    \ categories of\n   strings according to the risk they represent: low risk (80\
    \ percent of\n   applied-for strings), uncalculated risk (20 percent of applied-for\n\
    \   strings), and high risk (2 applied-for strings).\n   At the same time as the\
    \ [INTERISLE] study, ICANN published a\n   proposal, titled \"New gTLD Collision\
    \ Occurrence Management Plan\"\n   [NGCOMP], to manage the risk of name collisions\
    \ within the applied-\n   for gTLDs.  Based on measurements, ICANN deemed two\
    \ strings, .home\n   and .corp, to be high risk because of their widespread use\
    \ within\n   internal networks and would indefinitely delay their delegation\n\
    \   [INTERISLE].  Those strings within the uncalculated-risk\n   classification\
    \ would be delayed 2 to 3 months in their application\n   process while ICANN\
    \ conducted more research into whether the string\n   is of high- or low-risk\
    \ classification.  Those in the low-risk\n   classification would face a delay\
    \ in activating domains until 120\n   days after contracting with ICANN to allow\
    \ for the change in\n   certificate authority practices recommended in the SSAC\
    \ report on\n   internal name certificates [SAC057].\n   Within the ICANN proposal\
    \ [NGCOMP], an approach termed the\n   \"alternative path to delegation\" was\
    \ outlined, in which a registry\n   operator could elect to proceed with delegation,\
    \ provided it\n   initially blocked all second-level domains (SLDs) that appeared\
    \ in\n   the certain DITL datasets pending the completion of the assessment.\n\
    \   The majority of new gTLD applicants that were eligible elected this\n   alternative\
    \ path once otherwise approved for delegation.  The plan\n   also outlined an\
    \ outreach campaign to educate system administrators,\n   software developers,\
    \ and other engineers about the name collision\n   issue and possible mitigation\
    \ measures.\n   As a further provision, the \"New gTLD Collision Occurrence Management\n\
    \   Plan\" called for a follow-up study that would develop a \"Name\n   Collision\
    \ Occurrence Management Framework\" [NCOMF].  In February\n   2014, the document,\
    \ \"Mitigating the Risk of DNS Namespace Collisions:\n   Phase One Report,\" was\
    \ published by the ICANN-contracted group JAS\n   Global Advisors [MRDNC].  The\
    \ report provides a number of\n   recommendations for addressing the name collision\
    \ issue focusing on a\n   technique termed \"controlled interruption,\" in which\
    \ a registry would\n   temporarily resolve all SLDs (or all SLDs present in the\
    \ block list)\n   to a specific IP: 127.0.53.53.  The report also makes provisions\
    \ to\n   implement an emergency plan and strategy in case name collisions had\n\
    \   a \"clear danger to human life.\"\n"

  - "2.1.  Brief Update\n   In the time frame after the workshop, a final version\
    \ of the Phase\n   One Report was released in June 2014 [MRDNC].\n   In July 2014,\
    \ after a community review phase, a final recommendation\n   was issued by ICANN\
    \ [NCOMFINAL]; this has been followed by the\n   publication of management documents\
    \ for the implementation of a\n   controlled interrupt for new gTLD delegations\
    \ [NOCA] [NCSLDCIV]\n   [ADDNOCA].\n   Much of the framework called for in the\
    \ Name Collision Occurrence\n   Management Framework [NCOMF] was not released\
    \ by the time of writing\n   this document, and the Phase One Report [MRDNC] indicated\
    \ that its\n   publication was delayed due to a security vulnerability [JASBUG]\n\
    \   identified during the course of the work.\n   Broad community efforts to measure\
    \ the impact of name collisions were\n   not included in the final recommendation\
    \ issued by ICANN [NCOMFINAL].\n   At the time of this writing, RSSAC has just\
    \ published its\n   specification of common measurements to be collected by root\n\
    \   operators, meeting one part of the needs for measurements of the root\n  \
    \ server system [RSSAC002].\n"

  - "3.  Workshop Structure\n   The Workshop and Prize on Root Causes and Mitigation\
    \ of Name\n   Collisions [WPNC], sponsored by Verisign, took place March 8-10,\
    \ 2014\n   in London, United Kingdom.  The WPNC was open to the public, and it\n\
    \   gathered subject-area specialists, researchers, and practitioners to\n   discuss\
    \ and present their views, concerns, and ideas surrounding the\n   name collision\
    \ issue.  Proceedings are published at the workshop's\n   website [WPNC].\n  \
    \ The workshop focused on studies of name collision risks and\n   mitigations\
    \ with the expectation to advance the global community's\n   insight into operational\
    \ uses of name suffixes that can result in\n   name collisions and to gain a stronger\
    \ understanding of the potential\n   risks for the users of the installed systems.\
    \  Additional emphasis\n   and attention was given to discussions that might advance\
    \ the state\n   of knowledge about the architecture and impacts of DNS namespaces\n\
    \   with multiple scopes or resolution contexts and the utilization of\n   new\
    \ methods of monitoring and understanding the needs and methods for\n   mitigating\
    \ emerging Internet risks around name collisions.  A\n   technical program committee,\
    \ whose members spanned a variety of\n   organizations and universities, was assembled.\
    \  The committee issued\n   a call for papers and evaluated all submissions to\
    \ ensure the highest\n   level of quality.\n   A synthesis of the accepted papers\
    \ and conference proceedings is\n   captured in the subsections below.  Another\
    \ informal synopsis of the\n   workshop combined with individual statements and\
    \ observations is\n   available online [COMMENTARY].\n"
- title: 3.1.  Research Findings
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Research Findings\n   Many of the research papers focused on the analysis\
    \ of DITL data to\n   better understand various aspects of the root NXDOMAIN traffic\n\
    \   ([TECHNIQUES], [RARDBITS], [BLOCKLISTS], [MODELING], and\n   [SEARCHLISTS]).\
    \  Note: all workshop contributions are listed in\n   Appendix B; full papers\
    \ and slides are available at the website\n   [WPNC].\n   While the DITL data\
    \ has become the de facto referential dataset for\n   root traffic analysis, some\
    \ presenters echoed concerns that the\n   dataset may have become biased or polluted\
    \ with \"artificial\" queries\n   after the ICANN \"Reveal Day,\" in which the\
    \ list of applied-for gTLD\n   strings was publicly disclosed.  No conclusive\
    \ or empirical evidence\n   of tampering was presented; however, concerns about\
    \ the integrity and\n   reliability of future DITL collections and analysis for\
    \ purposes\n   related to new gTLDs were echoed by some panelists [IESCPANEL].\n\
    \   Furthermore, the statistical accuracy and completeness of DITL data\n   --\
    \ used to draw inferential conclusions or more specifically create\n   SLD block\
    \ lists -- was examined.  The efficacy of blocking domains\n   based on sampled\
    \ DNS data, e.g., DITL, was investigated by comparing\n   measurements of SLDs\
    \ within DITL and that of a multi-month root\n   NXDOMAIN collection at the A\
    \ and J roots [BLOCKLISTS].  The findings\n   provided insights into SLD-root\
    \ affinities, SLD temporal query\n   patterns and occurrence frequencies that\
    \ demonstrated the\n   ineffectiveness of block listing domains based on sampled\
    \ DNS data\n   such as [DITL].\n   Measurements of queries specifying the recursion\
    \ desired (RD) bit to\n   the roots in DITL were quantified to identify the level\
    \ and nature of\n   naive DNS clients and to determine and assess potential impacts\
    \ that\n   could arise from the proposed SLD blocking technique to these naive\n\
    \   clients [RARDBITS].  A substantial proportion of the root server\n   request\
    \ traffic contained queries with the RD bit specified.  Both in\n   absolute and\
    \ relative terms, requests specifying the RD bit for\n   applied-for gTLDs were\
    \ found to be significantly lower when compared\n   to existing TLDs.  The root\
    \ cause determination of what system or\n   mechanism is responsible for generating\
    \ the queries was inconclusive\n   and only speculative explanations of faulty\
    \ implementations of a DNS\n   resolving server were hypothesized.  However, the\
    \ analysis was also\n   not able to identify instances of actual or potential\
    \ harm resulting\n   from these naive clients, suggesting if SLD blocking techniques\
    \ were\n   to be utilized, it is unlikely there would be any negative impact to\n\
    \   these naive clients.\n"
- title: 3.2.  System Analysis
  contents:
  - "3.2.  System Analysis\n   Comparison of elements can often help us to understand\
    \ a system as a\n   whole.  A passive study of the DNS traffic in a provisioned\
    \ domain\n   such as \"corp.com\" may elucidate certain name collision parallels\n\
    \   [CORPCOM].  Such measurements were presented as a proxy for the\n   \".corp\"\
    \ potential new gTLD.  According to the study, significant DNS\n   traffic volume\
    \ was directed at a variety of third-level domains under\n   \"corp.com\".  This\
    \ prompted a series of questions surrounding how name\n   collisions can be identified,\
    \ as most end-users won't recognize that\n   problems may be due to a name collision.\
    \  How will users know that\n   the problem they are experiencing is a result\
    \ of a new, colliding\n   gTLD?  Will support groups be able to diagnose a name\
    \ collision event\n   from reported symptom(s)?  Will a collision-based security\
    \ hole be\n   detectable?\n   These questions, upon which underpinnings rely on\
    \ communication and\n   educational awareness, may find recommendations or parallels\
    \ from\n   other system references during the workshop [JASFRAMEWORK] -- such\
    \ as\n   the postal and telephone system.  Most telephone and postal systems\n\
    \   have evolved over time, requiring individuals to alter the way they\n   address\
    \ their parcels or place their calls.  Both systems implemented\n   their changes\
    \ in such a way that prior to the change, educational\n   material is distributed\
    \ and communicated and for a period of time and\n   after the change, compliance\
    \ of the previous standard is temporarily\n   accepted.  While the telephone and\
    \ postal system operate in a very\n   different way than the DNS, these parallels\
    \ of \"advanced\n   notification, education and communication, and a grace period\"\
    \ were\n   insightful for how other similar systems transitioned.\n"

  - "3.3.  Frameworks: Modeling, Analysis, and  Mitigation\n   Statements from several\
    \ TLD operators during the conference\n   reverberated a theme for the need of\
    \ improved tooling, education, and\n   communication surrounding name collisions.\
    \  The delegation of new\n   gTLDs is an ongoing event, and there is a clear and\
    \ immediate need\n   for these operators to have visibility to monitor and measure\
    \ the\n   effects of these new gTLD delegations.  A lack of tools, shared data,\n\
    \   communication, and education surrounding name collisions has\n   handicapped\
    \ operators in their ability to quantitatively measure and\n   proactively provide\
    \ any steps for mitigation of risks.  To this end,\n   numerous techniques, frameworks,\
    \ and models that focused on the\n   concepts of analyzing, detecting, and measuring\

    \ techniques to better understand the\n   contextual intent and ownership of DNS\
    \ queries.  An overview of\n   various DNS analysis techniques in which ways of\
    \ decomposing names,\n   measuring temporal distributions between queries, and\
    \ detecting\n   organizational/geographical affinities was presented [TECHNIQUES].\n\
    \   More-specific techniques were also showcased, such as a systematic\n   way\
    \ of observing and characterizing the impact of search lists within\n   root DNS\
    \ traffic allowing operators to quantify the number of unique\n   entities that\
    \ may be reliant on a particular name space\n   [SEARCHLISTS].  While not exhaustive,\
    \ the techniques presented have\n   been proven to elucidate patterns within root\
    \ DNS traffic data and\n   could serve as the potential building blocks of a DNS\
    \ analysis\n   framework.\n   Most of the previously published work focused on\
    \ name collisions has\n   produced various quantitative analyses based on observations\
    \ of\n   Internet traffic and data, including DNS queries and web content, in\n\
    \   which behavior and associated risks have been inferred.  An\n   understanding\
    \ of the inverse of the process by starting with a\n   fundamental model of name\
    \ resolution at the client was proposed as an\n   alternative means to define\
    \ risk [MODELING].  This model\n   deconstructed the process of name resolution\
    \ at the resolver library\n   of a client system and formalized a model from which\
    \ derived metrics\n   could be used to define and quantify associated risks. \
    \ While the\n   model presented is only a piece of the greater name collision\
    \ puzzle,\n   it provides potentially new insights into what may otherwise be\n\
    \   considered a missing piece.\n   Just as important as understanding the root\
    \ causes of name\n   collisions, providing effective mitigation strategies is\
    \ a critical\n   piece of the name collision puzzle.  Mitigation can be achieved\
    \ from\n   both higher levels, such as ICANN, as well as the enterprise level.\n\
    \   Proposed strategies for mitigating name collisions at both of these\n   levels\
    \ were presented.  While the technical details for each proposed\n   strategy\
    \ varies, underlying dependencies in both strategies require\n   operators to\
    \ monitor and educate/train their users.\n"

  - "3.4.  Conclusions and Next Steps\n   In their concluding statement [NEXTSTEPS],\
    \ the workshop committee\n   stated:\n      It occurs to the program committee\
    \ that the analysis of the\n      interactions between the different uses of domain\
    \ names within\n      local or global context is almost a nonexistent topic of\
    \ research.\n      This may have to do with the lack of accessible data, lack\
    \ of\n      theory of root causes, a lack of interest, or a bias in the\n    \
    \  participation of the workshop.  We think that this is evidence\n      that\
    \ this study of the global centrally important technical system\n      needs to\
    \ be ramped up.\n   Follow-on commentary [NEXTSTEPS] from the attendees reaffirmed\
    \ this\n   opinion with recurring messages of a need to understand the root\n\
    \   causes of name collision and the need to overcome shortcomings within\n  \
    \ our shared data collection, monitoring, and analysis of the DNS.\n   Many name\
    \ collision unknowns still exist.  What are the root causes\n   of these queries?\
    \  What is going on within a recursive name server?\n   What vulnerabilities or\
    \ subtle attack vectors do these new gTLD\n   delegations enable?  The limited\
    \ datasets available to researchers\n   and operators are not sufficient to draw\
    \ baseline measurements for\n   these questions, forcing the community to make\
    \ inferences and rank\n   guesses as to what is going on within the DNS.  Using\
    \ these\n   suboptimal data repositories to create solutions such as block lists\n\
    \   is only dealing with the symptoms of the problem and not addressing\n   the\
    \ root cause.  To properly answer these questions, the community\n   needs to\
    \ address the issue of a shortage of funding and data\n   collection/analysis.\
    \  Communication and educational outreach programs\n   need to be improved in\
    \ order raise the awareness of impacted parties\n   and broaden participation\
    \ and sharing.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Workshop participants discussed security aspects\
    \ related to root\n   cause analysis and mitigation techniques of potential name\
    \ collision\n   events.  As noted in several papers and presentations, security\n\
    \   concerns may both arise and be addressed with name collision\n   mitigation\
    \ techniques.  Follow-on measurement-based research is\n   important to security\
    \ considerations for name collisions.\n"
