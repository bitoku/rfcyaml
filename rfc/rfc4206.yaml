  - "Abstract\n   To improve scalability of Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching\n\
    \   (GMPLS) it may be useful to aggregate Label Switched Paths (LSPs) by\n   creating\
    \ a hierarchy of such LSPs.  A way to create such a hierarchy\n   is by (a) a\
    \ Label Switching Router (LSR) creating a Traffic\n   Engineering Label Switched\
    \ Path (TE LSP), (b) the LSR forming a\n   forwarding adjacency (FA) out of that\
    \ LSP (by advertising this LSP as\n   a Traffic Engineering (TE) link into the\
    \ same instance of ISIS/OSPF\n   as the one that was used to create the LSP),\
    \ (c) allowing other LSRs\n   to use FAs for their path computation, and (d) nesting\
    \ of LSPs\n   originated by other LSRs into that LSP (by using the label stack\n\
    \   construct).\n   This document describes the mechanisms to accomplish this.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  Overview\n   An LSR uses Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) TE procedures to create\
    \ and\n   maintain an LSP.  The LSR then may (under local configuration\n   control)\
    \ announce this LSP as a Traffic Engineering (TE) link into\n   the same instance\
    \ of the GMPLS control plane (or, more precisely, its\n   ISIS/OSPF component)\
    \ as the one that was used to create the LSP.  We\n   call such a link a \"forwarding\
    \ adjacency\" (FA).  We refer to the LSP\n   as the \"forwarding adjacency LSP\"\
    , or just FA-LSP.  Note that an FA-\n   LSP is both created and used as a TE link\
    \ by exactly the same\n   instance of the GMPLS control plane.  Thus, the concept\
    \ of an FA is\n   applicable only when an LSP is both created and used as a TE\
    \ link by\n   exactly the same instance of the GMPLS control plane.  Note also\
    \ that\n   an FA is a TE link between two GMPLS nodes whose path transits zero\n\
    \   or more (G)MPLS nodes in the same instance of the GMPLS control\n   plane.\n\
    \   The nodes connected by a 'basic' TE link may have a routing\n   adjacency;\
    \ however, the nodes connected by an FA would not usually\n   have a routing adjacency.\
    \  A TE link of any kind (either 'basic' or\n   FA) would have to have a signaling\
    \ adjacency in order for it to be\n   used to establish an LSP across it.\n  \
    \ In general, the creation/termination of an FA and its FA-LSP could be\n   driven\
    \ either by mechanisms outside of GMPLS (e.g., via configuration\n   control on\
    \ the LSR at the head-end of the adjacency), or by\n   mechanisms within GMPLS\
    \ (e.g., as a result of the LSR at the head-end\n   of the adjacency receiving\
    \ LSP setup requests originated by some\n   other LSRs).\n   ISIS/OSPF floods\
    \ the information about FAs just as it floods the\n   information about any other\
    \ links.  As a result of this flooding, an\n   LSR has in its TE link state database\
    \ the information about not just\n   basic TE links, but FAs as well.\n   An LSR,\
    \ when performing path computation, uses not just basic TE\n   links, but FAs\
    \ as well.  Once a path is computed, the LSR uses\n   RSVP/CR-LDP [RSVP-TE, CR-LDP]\
    \ for establishing label binding along\n   the path.\n   In this document we define\
    \ mechanisms/procedures to accomplish the\n   above.  These mechanisms/procedures\
    \ cover both the routing\n   (ISIS/OSPF) and the signalling (RSVP/CR-LDP) aspects.\n\
    \   Note that an LSP may be advertised as a point-to-point link into ISIS\n  \
    \ or OSPF, to be used in normal SPF by nodes other than the head-end.\n   While\
    \ this is similar in spirit to an FA, this is beyond the scope of\n   this document.\n\
    \   Scenarios where an LSP is created (and maintained) by one instance of\n  \
    \ the GMPLS control plane, and is used as a (TE) link by another\n   instance\
    \ of the GMPLS control plane, are outside the scope of this\n   document.\n"

- title: 3.  Routing Aspects
  contents:
  - "3.  Routing Aspects\n   In this section we describe procedures for constructing\
    \ FAs out of\n   LSPs, and handling of FAs by ISIS/OSPF.  Specifically, this section\n\
    \   describes how to construct the information needed to advertise LSPs\n   as\
    \ links into ISIS/OSPF.  Procedures for creation/termination of such\n   LSPs\
    \ are defined in Section 5, \"Controlling FA-LSPs boundaries\".\n   FAs may be\
    \ represented as either unnumbered or numbered links.  If\n   FAs are numbered\
    \ with IPv4 addresses, the local and remote IPv4\n   addresses come out of a /31\
    \ that is allocated by the LSR that\n   originates the FA-LSP; the head-end address\
    \ of the FA-LSP is the one\n   specified as the IPv4 tunnel sender address; the\
    \ remote (tail-end)\n   address can then be inferred.  If the LSP is bidirectional,\
    \ the\n   tail-end can thus know the addresses to assign to the reverse FA.\n\
    \   If there are multiple LSPs that all originate on one LSR and all\n   terminate\
    \ on another LSR, then at one end of the spectrum all these\n   LSPs could be\
    \ merged (under control of the head-end LSR) into a\n   single FA using the concept\
    \ of Link Bundling (see [BUNDLE]); while at\n   the other end of the spectrum\
    \ each such LSP could be advertised as\n   its own adjacency.\n   When an FA is\
    \ created under administrative control (static\n   provisioning), the attributes\
    \ of the FA-LSP have to be provided via\n   configuration.  Specifically, the\
    \ following attributes may be\n   configured for the FA-LSP: the head-end address\
    \ (if left\n   unconfigured, this defaults to the head-end LSR's Router ID); the\n\
    \   tail-end address; bandwidth and resource colors constraints.  The\n   path\
    \ taken by the FA-LSP may be either computed by the LSR at the\n   head-end of\
    \ the FA-LSP, or specified by explicit configuration; this\n   choice is determined\
    \ by configuration.\n   When an FA is created dynamically, the attributes of its\
    \ FA-LSP are\n   inherited from the LSP that induced its creation.  Note that\
    \ the\n   bandwidth of the FA-LSP must be at least as big as the LSP that\n  \
    \ induced it, but may be bigger if only discrete bandwidths are\n   available\
    \ for the FA-LSP.  In general, for dynamically provisioned\n   FAs, a policy-based\
    \ mechanism may be needed to associate attributes\n   to the FA-LSPs.\n"

    \ by\n   other LSRs.  The information carried is the union of the SRLGs of the\n\
    \   underlying TE links that make up the FA-LSP path; it is carried in\n   the\
    \ SRLG TLV in IS-IS or the SRLG sub-TLV of the TE Link TLV in OSPF.\n   See [GMPLS-ISIS,\

    \   It may be desired in some cases to use FAs only in Traffic\n   Engineering\
    \ path computations.  In IS-IS, this can be accomplished by\n   setting the default\
    \ metric of the extended IS reachability TLV for\n   the FA to the maximum link\
    \ metric (2^24 - 1).  In OSPF, this can be\n   accomplished by not advertising\
    \ the link as a regular LSA, but only\n   as a TE opaque LSA.\n"

    region\").\n"
- title: 5.1.  LSP Regions
  contents:
  - "5.1.  LSP Regions\n   The information carried in the Interface Switching Capabilities\
    \ is\n   used to construct LSP regions and to determine regions' boundaries as\n\
    \   follows.\n   Define an ordering among interface switching capabilities as\
    \ follows:\n   PSC-1 < PSC-2 < PSC-3 < PSC-4 < TDM < LSC < FSC.  Given two\n \
    \  interfaces if-1 and if-2 with interface switching capabilities isc-1\n   and\
    \ isc-2 respectively, say that if-1 < if-2 iff isc-1 < isc-2 or\n   isc-1 == isc-2\
    \ == TDM, and if-1's max LSP bandwidth is less than if-\n   2's max LSP bandwidth.\n\
    \   Suppose an LSP's path is as follows: node-0, link-1, node-1, link-2,\n   node-2,\
    \ ..., link-n, node-n.  Moreover, for link-i denote by [link-i,\n   node-(i-1)]\
    \ the interface that connects link-i to node-(i-1), and by\n   [link-i, node-i]\
    \ the interface that connects link-i to node-i.\n   If [link-(i+1), node-i)] <\
    \ [link-(i+1), node-(i+1)], we say that the\n   LSP has crossed a region boundary\
    \ at node-i; with respect to that LSP\n   path, the LSR at node-i is an edge LSR.\
    \  The 'other edge' of the\n   region with respect to the LSP path is node-k,\

  contents:
  - "6.1.1.  RSVP-TE\n   If one uses RSVP-TE to signal an LSP to be tunneled over\

    \   [GRSVP-TE, GSIG] instead of an RSVP_HOP object; and the data\n   interface\
    \ identification MUST identify the FA-LSP.\n   The preferred method of sending\
    \ the Path message is to set the\n   destination IP address of the Path message\
    \ to the computed NHOP for\n   that Path message.  This NHOP address must be a\
    \ routable address; in\n   the case of separate control and data planes, this\
    \ must be a control\n   plane address.\n   Furthermore, the IP header for the\
    \ Path message MUST NOT have the\n   Router Alert option.  The Path message is\
    \ intended to be IP-routed to\n   the tail-end of the FA-LSP without being intercepted\
    \ and processed as\n   an RSVP message by any of the intermediate nodes.\n   Finally,\
    \ the IP TTL vs. RSVP TTL check MUST NOT be made.  In general,\n   if the IF_ID\
    \ RSVP_HOP object is used, this check must be disabled, as\n   the number of hops\

    \ carried out is beyond the scope of this document;\n   suffice it to say that\
    \ it may require a Traffic Engineering Database,\n   or the use of LMP [LMP],\
    \ or yet other means.\n   An alternative method is to encapsulate the Path message\
    \ in an IP\n   tunnel (or, in the case that the Interface Switching Capability\
    \ of\n   the FA-LSP is PSC[1-4], in the FA-LSP itself), and unicast the\n   message\

    \ whether the Router Alert option is present.\n   A PathErr sent in response to\
    \ a Path message with an IF_ID RSVP_HOP\n   object SHOULD contain an IF_ID HOP\

    \   database.  The LSR then extracts (from the ERO) the subsequence of\n   hops\
    \ from itself to the other end of the region.\n   The LSR then compares the subsequence\
    \ of hops with all existing FA-\n   LSPs originated by the LSR.  If a match is\
    \ found, that FA-LSP has\n   enough unreserved bandwidth for the LSP being signaled,\
    \ the L3PID of\n   the FA-LSP is compatible with the L3PID of the LSP being signaled,\n\
    \   and the LSR uses that FA-LSP as follows.  The Path/Request message\n   for\
    \ the original LSP is sent to the egress of the FA-LSP, not to the\n   next hop\
    \ along the FA-LSP's path.  The PHOP in the message is the\n   address of the\
    \ LSR at the head-end of the FA-LSP.  Before sending the\n   Path/Request message,\
    \ the ERO in that message is adjusted by removing\n   the subsequence of the ERO\
    \ that lies in the FA-LSP, and replacing it\n   with just the end point of the\
    \ FA-LSP.\n   Otherwise (if no existing FA-LSP is found), the LSR sets up a new\n\
    \   FA-LSP.  That is, it initiates a new LSP setup just for the FA-LSP.\n   Note\
    \ that the new LSP may traverse either 'basic' TE links or FAs.\n   After the\
    \ LSR establishes the new FA-LSP, the LSR announces this LSP\n   into IS-IS/OSPF\
    \ as an FA.\n   The unreserved bandwidth of the FA is computed by subtracting\
    \ the\n   bandwidth of sessions pending the establishment of the FA-LSP\n   associated\
    \ from the bandwidth of the FA-LSP.\n   An FA-LSP could be torn down by the LSR\
    \ at the head-end of the FA-LSP\n   as a matter of policy local to the LSR.  It\
    \ is expected that the FA-\n   LSP would be torn down once there are no more LSPs\
    \ carried by the\n   FA-LSP.  When the FA-LSP is torn down, the FA associated\
    \ with the\n   FA-LSP is no longer advertised into IS-IS/OSPF.\n"
- title: 6.3.  FA-LSP Holding Priority
  contents:
  - "6.3.  FA-LSP Holding Priority\n   The value of the holding priority of an FA-LSP\
    \ must be the minimum of\n   the configured holding priority of the FA-LSP and\
    \ the holding\n   priorities of the LSPs tunneling through the FA-LSP (note that\n\
    \   smaller priority values denote higher priority).  Thus, if an LSP of\n   higher\
    \ priority than the FA-LSP tunnels through the FA-LSP, the FA-\n   LSP is itself\
    \ promoted to the higher priority.  However, if the\n   tunneled LSP is torn down,\
    \ the FA-LSP need not drop its priority to\n   its old value right away; it may\
    \ be advisable to apply hysteresis in\n   this case.\n   If the holding priority\
    \ of an FA-LSP is configured, this document\n   restricts it to 0.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   From a security point of view, the primary change\
    \ introduced in this\n   document is that the implicit assumption of a binding\
    \ between data\n   interfaces and the interface over which a control message is\
    \ sent is\n   no longer valid.\n   This means that the \"sending interface\" or\
    \ \"receiving interface\" is\n   no longer well-defined, as the interface over\
    \ which an RSVP message\n   is sent may change as routing changes.  Therefore,\
    \ mechanisms that\n   depend on these concepts (for example, the definition of\
    \ a security\n   association) need a clearer definition.\n   [RFC2747] provides\
    \ a solution: in Section 2.1, under \"Key\n   Identifier\", an IP address is a\
    \ valid identifier for the sending (and\n   by analogy, receiving) interface.\
    \  Since RSVP messages for a given\n   LSP are sent to an IP address that identifies\
    \ the next/previous hop\n   for the LSP, one can replace all occurrences of 'sending\
    \ [receiving]\n   interface' with 'receiver's [sender's] IP address' (respectively).\n\
    \   For example, in Section 4, third paragraph, instead of:\n      \"Each sender\
    \ SHOULD have distinct security associations (and keys)\n      per secured sending\
    \ interface (or LIH).  ...  At the sender,\n      security association selection\
    \ is based on the interface through\n      which the message is sent.\"\n   it\
    \ should read:\n      \"Each sender SHOULD have distinct security associations\
    \ (and keys)\n      per secured receiver's IP address. ...  At the sender, security\n\
    \      association selection is based on the IP address to which the\n      message\
    \ is sent.\"\n   Note that CR-LDP does not have this issue, as CR-LDP messages\
    \ are\n   sent over TCP sessions, and no assumption is made that these sessions\n\
    \   are to direct neighbors.  The recommended mechanism for\n   authentication\
    \ and integrity of LDP message exchange is to use the\n   TCP MD5 option [LDP].\n\
    \   Another consequence (relevant to RSVP) of the changes proposed in\n   this\
    \ document is that IP destination address of Path messages be set\n   to the receiver's\
    \ address, not to the session destination.  Thus, the\n   objections raised in\
    \ Section 1.2 of [RFC2747] should be revisited to\n   see if IPSec AH is now a\
    \ viable means of securing RSVP-TE messages.\n"
