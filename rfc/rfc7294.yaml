  - "1.1.  Loss Concealment and Concealed Seconds Metrics Blocks\n   At any instant,\
    \ the audio output at a receiver may be classified as\n   either 'normal' or 'concealed'.\
    \  'Normal' refers to playout of audio\n   payload received from the remote end\
    \ and also includes locally\n   generated signals such as announcements, tones,\
    \ and comfort noise.\n   'Concealed' refers to playout of locally generated signals\
    \ used to\n   mask the impact of network impairments or to reduce the audibility\
    \ of\n   jitter buffer adaptations.\n   This document defines two new concealment-related\
    \ block types to\n   augment those defined in [RFC3611] for use in a range of\
    \ RTP\n   applications.  These two block types extend the packet loss\n   concealment\
    \ mechanism defined in Section 4.7.6 of [RFC3611].\n   The first block type, the\
    \ Loss Concealment Metrics Block, provides\n   metrics for actions taken by the\
    \ receiver to mitigate the effect of\n   packet loss and packet discard.  Specifically,\
    \ the first metric\n   (On-Time Playout Duration) reports the duration of normal\
    \ playout of\n   data that the receiver obtained from the sender's stream.  A\
    \ second\n   metric (Loss Concealment Duration) reports the total time during\n\
    \   which the receiver played out media data that was manufactured\n   locally,\
    \ because the sender's data for these periods was not\n   available due to packet\
    \ loss or discard.  A similar metric (Buffer\n   Adjustment Concealment Duration)\
    \ reports the duration of playout of\n   locally manufactured data replacing data\
    \ that is unavailable due to\n   adaptation of an adaptive de-jitter buffer. \
    \ Further metrics (Playout\n   Interrupt Count and Mean Playout Interrupt Size)\
    \ report the number of\n   times normal playout was interrupted and the mean duration\
    \ of these\n   interruptions.\n   Loss Concealment Duration and Buffer Adjustment\
    \ Concealment Duration\n   are reported separately because buffer adjustment is\
    \ typically\n   arranged to occur in silence periods, so it may have very little\n\
    \   impact on user experience, whilst loss concealment may occur at any\n   time.\n\
    \   The second block type, the Concealed Seconds Metrics Block, provides\n   metrics\
    \ for Concealed Seconds, which are measured at the receiving\n   end of the RTP\
    \ stream.  Specifically, the first metric (Unimpaired\n   Seconds) reports the\
    \ number of whole seconds occupied only with\n   normal playout of data that the\
    \ receiver obtained from the sender's\n   stream.  The second metric (Concealed\
    \ Seconds) reports the number of\n   whole seconds during which the receiver played\
    \ out any locally\n   generated media data.  A third metric, Severely Concealed\
    \ Seconds\n   (SCSs), reports the number of whole seconds during which the receiver\n\
    \   played out locally generated data to conceal a lost or discarded\n   frame\
    \ percentage in excess of the configured SCS Threshold.\n   These metrics belongs\
    \ to the class of transport-related terminal\n   metrics defined in [RFC6792].\n"

    \  The RTP\n   Monitoring Framework [RFC6792] provides guidelines for reporting\n\
    \   block format using RTCP XR.  The metrics blocks described in this\n   document\
    \ are in accordance with those guidelines.\n"
- title: 1.4.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "1.4.  Applicability\n   These metrics are applicable to audio applications of\
    \ RTP and the\n   audio component of audio/video applications in which the packet\

    \   the impact of network impairments to user's perception of media\n   quality.\n"

- title: 2.2.  Notations
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Notations\n   The report blocks in this document make use of binary fractions.\
    \  The\n   following terminology is used:\n      Numeric formats S X:Y\n     \
    \    where S indicates a two's complement signed representation, X\n         the\
    \ number of bits prior to the decimal place, and Y the number\n         of bits\
    \ after the decimal place.\n         Hence, 8:8 represents an unsigned number\
    \ in the range 0.0 to\n         255.996 with a granularity of 0.0039.  S7:8 would\
    \ represent the\n         range -127.996 to +127.996. 0:16 represents a proper\
    \ binary\n         fraction with range\n         0.0 to 1 - 1/65536 = 0.9999847\n\
    \         though note that use of flag values at the top of the numeric\n    \
    \     range slightly reduces this upper limit.  For example, if the\n        \
    \ 16-bit values 0xFFFE and 0xFFFF are used as flags for \"over-\n         range\"\
    \ and \"unavailable\" conditions, a 0:16 quantity has range\n         0.0 to 1\

    \ Concealment Method (plc): 2 bits\n      This field is used to identify the packet\
    \ loss concealment method\n      in use at the receiver, according to the following\
    \ code:\n         bits 014-015\n            0 = silence insertion\n          \
    \  1 = simple replay, no attenuation\n            2 = simple replay, with attenuation\n\

    \ that the enhancement method (plc=3) for packet loss\n      concealment offers\
    \ an improved audio quality and better robustness\n      against packet losses\
    \ [G.711] and is equivalent to \"enhanced\" in\n      Section 4.7.6 of [RFC3611].\n\
    \   Reserved (resv): 4 bits\n      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set\

    \   block length: 16 bits\n      The length of this report block in 32-bit words,\

    \ periods of remote\n      talker silence, if Voice Activity Detection (VAD) [VAD]\
    \ is used,\n      and locally generated or regenerated tones and announcements.\n\
    \      An equivalent definition is that on-time playout is playout of any\n  \
    \    signal other than those used for concealment.\n      On-time playout duration\
    \ is expressed in units of RTP timestamp\n      and MUST include both speech and\

    \ value exceeding 0xFFFFFFFD), and a\n      value of 0xFFFFFFFF indicates that\
    \ the measurement is unavailable.\n   Loss Concealment Duration: 32 bits\n   \
    \   The duration, expressed in units of RTP timestamp, of audio\n      playout\
    \ corresponding to Loss-Type concealment.\n      Loss-Type concealment is reactive\
    \ insertion or deletion of samples\n      in the audio playout stream due to effective\
    \ frame loss at the\n      audio decoder.  Effective frame loss is the event in\
    \ which a frame\n      of coded audio is simply not present at the audio decoder\
    \ when\n      required.  In this case, substitute audio samples are generally\n\
    \      formed, at the decoder or elsewhere, to reduce audible impairment.\n  \
    \    Two values are reserved: a value of 0xFFFFFFFE indicates out of\n      range\
    \ (that is, a measured value exceeding 0xFFFFFFFD), and a\n      value of 0xFFFFFFFF\
    \ indicates that the measurement is unavailable.\n   Buffer Adjustment Concealment\
    \ Duration: 32 bits\n      The duration, expressed in units of RTP timestamp,\
    \ of audio\n      playout corresponding to Buffer Adjustment-Type concealment,\
    \ if\n      known.\n      Buffer Adjustment-Type concealment is proactive or controlled\n\
    \      insertion or deletion of samples in the audio playout stream due\n    \
    \  to jitter buffer adaptation, re-sizing decisions, or re-centering\n      decisions\
    \ within the endpoint.\n      Because this insertion is controlled, rather than\
    \ occurring\n      randomly in response to losses, it is typically less audible\
    \ than\n      Loss-Type concealment.  For example, jitter buffer adaptation\n\
    \      events may be constrained to occur during periods of talker\n      silence,\
    \ in which case only silence duration is affected, or\n      sophisticated time-stretching\

    \ the measurement is unavailable.\n   Playout Interrupt Count: 16 bits\n     \
    \ The number of interruptions to normal playout that occurred during\n      the\

  - "4.2.  Definition of Fields in Concealed Seconds Metrics Block\n   Block type\
    \ (BT): 8 bits\n      A Concealed Seconds Metrics Block is identified by the constant\n\
    \      31.\n   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bits\n      This field is used to indicate\
    \ whether the Concealed Seconds\n      metrics are Sampled, Interval, or Cumulative\
    \ metrics:\n         I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the\n\
    \         most recent measurement interval duration between successive\n     \
    \    metrics reports.\n         I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value\
    \ applies to the\n         accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements.\n\
    \         I=01: Sampled Value - the reported value is a sampled\n         instantaneous\
    \ value (Not allowed in this block).\n         I=00: Reserved value - this value\
    \ is reserved for future use.\n      In this document, Concealed Seconds metrics\
    \ can only be measured\n      over definite intervals and cannot be sampled. \
    \ Senders MUST NOT\n      use the values I=00 or I=01.  If a block is received\
    \ with I=00 or\n      I=01, the receiver MUST discard the block.\n   Packet Loss\
    \ Concealment Method (plc): 2 bits\n      This field is used to identify the packet\
    \ loss concealment method\n      in use at the receiver, according to the following\
    \ code:\n         bits 014-015\n            0 = silence insertion\n          \
    \  1 = simple replay, no attenuation\n            2 = simple replay, with attenuation\n\
    \            3 = enhancement\n            Other values are reserved.\n      Note\
    \ that the enhancement method (plc=3) for packet loss\n      concealment offers\
    \ an improved audio quality and a better\n      robustness against packet losses\
    \ [G.711] and is equivalent to\n      \"enhanced\" in Section 4.7.6 of [RFC3611].\n\
    \   Reserved (resv): 4 bits\n      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set\
    \ to zero by senders and\n      ignored by receivers (see [RFC6709], Section 4.2).\n\
    \   Block Length: 16 bits\n      The length of this report block in 32-bit words,\
    \ minus one.  For\n      the Concealed Seconds Metrics Block, the block length\
    \ is equal to\n      4.\n   SSRC of Source: 32 bits\n      As defined in Section\
    \ 4.1 of [RFC3611].\n   Unimpaired Seconds: 32 bits\n      A count of the number\
    \ of Unimpaired Seconds that have occurred.\n      An Unimpaired Second is defined\
    \ as a continuous period of one\n      second during which no frame loss or discard\
    \ due to late arrival\n      has occurred.  Every second in a session must be\
    \ classified as\n      either OK or Concealed.\n      Normal playout of comfort\
    \ noise or other silence-concealment\n      signals during periods of talker silence,\
    \ if VAD is used, shall be\n      counted as Unimpaired Seconds.\n      Two values\
    \ are reserved: a value of 0xFFFFFFFE indicates out of\n      range (that is,\
    \ a measured value exceeding 0xFFFFFFFD), and a\n      value of 0xFFFFFFFF indicates\
    \ that the measurement is unavailable.\n   Concealed Seconds: 32 bits\n      A\
    \ count of the number of Concealed Seconds that have occurred.\n      A Concealed\
    \ Second is defined as a continuous period of one second\n      during which any\
    \ frame loss or discard due to late arrival has\n      occurred.\n      Equivalently,\
    \ a Concealed Second is one in which some Loss-Type\n      concealment has occurred.\
    \  Buffer Adjustment-Type concealment\n      SHOULD NOT cause Concealed Seconds\
    \ to be incremented, with the\n      following exception.  An implementation MAY\
    \ cause Concealed\n      Seconds to be incremented for 'emergency' buffer adjustments\
    \ made\n      during talkspurts.\n      Loss-Type concealment is reactive insertion\
    \ or deletion of samples\n      in the audio playout stream due to effective frame\
    \ loss at the\n      audio decoder.  \"Effective frame loss\" is the event in\
    \ which a\n      frame of coded audio is simply not present at the audio decoder\n\
    \      when required.  In this case, substitute audio samples are\n      generally\
    \ formed, at the decoder or elsewhere, to reduce audible\n      impairment.\n\
    \      Buffer Adjustment-Type concealment is proactive or controlled\n      insertion\
    \ or deletion of samples in the audio playout stream due\n      to jitter buffer\
    \ adaptation, re-sizing decisions, or re-centering\n      decisions within the\
    \ endpoint.\n      Because this insertion is controlled, rather than occurring\n\
    \      randomly in response to losses, it is typically less audible than\n   \
    \   Loss-Type concealment.  For example, jitter buffer adaptation\n      events\
    \ may be constrained to occur during periods of talker\n      silence, in which\
    \ case only silence duration is affected, or\n      sophisticated time-stretching\
    \ methods for insertion/deletion\n      during favorable periods in active speech\
    \ may be employed.  For\n      these reasons, Buffer Adjustment-Type concealment\
    \ MAY be exempted\n      from inclusion in calculations of Concealed Seconds and\
    \ Severely\n      Concealed Seconds.\n      However, an implementation SHOULD\
    \ include Buffer Adjustment-Type\n      concealment in counts of Concealed Seconds\
    \ and Severely Concealed\n      Seconds if the event occurs at an 'inopportune'\
    \ moment, such as an\n      emergency or large, immediate adaptation during active\
    \ speech or\n      an unsophisticated adaptation during speech without regard\
    \ for the\n      underlying signal.  In these cases, the assumption of low\n \
    \     audibility cannot hold.  In other words, jitter buffer adaptation\n    \
    \  events that may be presumed to be audible SHOULD be included in\n      Concealed\
    \ Seconds and Severely Concealed Seconds counts.\n      Concealment events that\
    \ cannot be classified as Buffer Adjustment-\n      Type MUST be classified as\
    \ Loss-Type.\n      For clarification, the count of Concealed Seconds MUST include\
    \ the\n      count of Severely Concealed Seconds.\n      Two values are reserved:\
    \ a value of 0xFFFFFFFE indicates out of\n      range (that is, a measured value\
    \ exceeding 0xFFFFFFFD), and a\n      value of 0xFFFFFFFF indicates that the measurement\
    \ is unavailable.\n   Severely Concealed Seconds: 16 bits\n      A count of the\
    \ number of Severely Concealed Seconds.\n      A Severely Concealed Second is\
    \ defined as a non-overlapping period\n      of one second during which the cumulative\
    \ amount of time that has\n      been subject to frame loss or discard due to\
    \ late arrival exceeds\n      the SCS Threshold.\n      Two values are reserved:\
    \ a value of 0xFFFE indicates out of range\n      (that is, a measured value exceeding\
    \ 0xFFFD), and a value of\n      0xFFFF indicates that the measurement is unavailable.\n\
    \   Reserved: 8 bits\n      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set to zero\
    \ by senders and\n      ignored by receivers (see [RFC6709], Section 4.2).\n \
    \  SCS Threshold: 8 bits\n      The SCS Threshold is defined as the percentage\
    \ of packets\n      corresponding to lost or discarded frames that must occur\
    \ within a\n      one second period in order for the second to be classified as\
    \ a\n      Severely Concealed Second.  This is expressed in numeric format\n \
    \     0:8 and hence can represent a range of 0 to 99.6 percent loss or\n     \
    \ discard.\n      A default threshold of 5 percent effective frame loss (50 ms\n\
    \      effective frame loss ) per second is suggested.  This corresponds\n   \
    \   to an SCS Threshold in hexadecimal of 0x0D.\n"
