    \ application/QSIG objects for use in SIP applications, according to\n   the rules\

  - "1. Introduction\n   ISUP (ISDN User part) defined in the ITU-T recommendations\
    \ Q.761-4 is\n   a signaling protocol used between telephony switches.  There\
    \ are\n   configurations in which ISUP-encoded signaling information needs to\n\
    \   be transported between SIP entities as part of the payload of SIP\n   messages,\
    \ where the preservation of ISUP data is necessary for the\n   proper operation\
    \ of PSTN features.\n   QSIG is the analogous signaling protocol used between\
    \ private branch\n   exchanges to support calls within private telephony networks.\
    \  There\n   is a similar need to transport QSIG-encoded signaling information\n\
    \   between SIP entities in some environments.\n   This document is specific to\
    \ this usage and would not apply to the\n   transportation of ISUP or QSIG messages\
    \ in other applications. These\n   media types are intended for ISUP or QSIG application\
    \ information\n   that is used within the context of a SIP session, and not as\
    \ general\n   purpose transport of SCN signaling.\n   The definition of media\
    \ types for ISUP and QSIG application\n   information does not address fully how\
    \ the non-SIP and SIP entities\n   exchanging messages determine or negotiate\
    \ compatibility.  It is\n   assumed that this is addressed by alternative means\
    \ such as the\n   configuration of the interworking functions.\n   This is intended\
    \ to be an IETF approved MIME type, and to be defined\n   through an RFC.  NOTE:\
    \ usage of Q.SIG within SIP is neither endorsed\n   nor recommended as a result\
    \ of this MIME registration.\n"
- title: 3. Proposed new media types
  contents:
  - "3. Proposed new media types\n   ISUP and QSIG messages are composed of arbitrary\
    \ binary data that is\n   transparent to SIP processing. The best way to encode\
    \ these is to use\n   binary encoding. This is in conformance with the restrictions\
    \ imposed\n   on the use of binary data for MIME (RFC 2045 [3]). It should be\
    \ noted\n   that the rules mentioned in the RFC 2045 apply to Internet mail\n\
    \   messages and not to SIP  messages. Binary has been preferred over\n   Base64\
    \ encoding because the latter would only result in adding bulk\n   to the encoded\
    \ messages and possibly be more costly in terms of\n   processing power.\n"
- title: 3.1 ISUP Media Type
  contents:
  - "3.1 ISUP Media Type\n   This media type is defined by the following information:\n\
    \   Media type name: application\n   Media subtype name: ISUP\n   Required parameters:\
    \ version\n   Optional parameters: base\n   Encoding scheme: binary\n   Security\
    \ considerations: See section 5.\n   The ISUP message is encapsulated beginning\
    \ with the Message Type Code\n   (i.e., omitting Routing Label and Circuit ID\
    \ Code).\n   The use of the 'version' parameter allows network administrators\
    \ to\n   identify specific versions of ISUP that will be exchanged on a\n   bilateral\
    \ basis. This enables a particular client such as a\n   SoftSwitch/Media Gateway\
    \ Controller to recognize and parse the\n   message correctly,  or (possibly)\
    \ to reject the message if the\n   specified ISUP version is not supported. This\
    \ specification places no\n   constraints on the values that may be used in 'version';\
    \ these are\n   left to the discretion of the network administrator.\n   This\
    \ 'version' could, for example, be used to identify a network-\n   specific implementation\
    \ of ISUP, e.g., X-NetxProprietaryISUPv3, or to\n   identify a well-known standard\
    \ version of ISUP, e.g., itu-t or ansi.\n   A 'base' parameter can optionally\
    \ be included in some cases (e.g., if\n   the receiver may not recognize the 'version'\
    \ string) to specify that\n   the encapsulated ISUP can also be processed using\
    \ the identified\n   'base' specification.  Table 1 provides a list of 'base'\
    \ values\n   supported by the 'application/ISUP' media type, including whether\
    \ or\n   not the forward compatibility mechanism defined in ITU-T 1992 ISUP is\n\

    \ symbols used within the ISUP and QSIG\n   MIME types must specify a definitive\
    \ specification reference,\n   identifying a particular issue of the specification,\

    \ reference\n   requires a review process; the authors recommend that a subject\n\

    \ Review.\n   Note that where a specification is fully peer-to-peer backwards\n\
    \   compatible with a previous issue (i.e., the compatibility mechanism\n   is\
    \ supported by both), then there is no need for separate symbols to\n   be registered.\
    \ The symbol for the original specification should be\n   used to identify backwards-compatible\
    \ upgrades of that specification\n   as well.\n   Symbols beginning with the characters\
    \ 'X-' are reserved for non-\n   standard usage (e.g., cases in which a token\
    \ other than a string\n   representing an issue of an ISUP specification is appropriate\

    \ body whose content type or\n   disposition type it does not understand. If the\
    \ parameter has the\n   value \"optional\", the UAS MUST ignore the message body;\
    \ if it has the\n   value \"required\", the UAS MUST return 415 (Unsupported Media\
    \ Type).\n   If the handling parameter is missing, the value \"required\" is to\
    \ be\n   assumed.\n"
