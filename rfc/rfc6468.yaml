- title: 1.1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Overview\n   The Notify extension [RFC5435] to the Sieve mail filtering\
    \ language\n   [RFC5228] is a framework for providing notifications by employing\n\
    \   URIs that specify the notification mechanism.  (See RFC 5435 for\n   details\
    \ about the motivation and use cases.)  This document defines\n   how Session\
    \ Initiation Protocol (SIP) URIs [RFC3261] are used to\n   generate notifications\
    \ via SIP MESSAGE [RFC3428].\n"
- title: 1.2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"\
    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n   This document inherits terminology from the Sieve email\
    \ filtering\n   language [RFC5228], the Sieve Notify extension [RFC5435], and\
    \ RFC\n   3261 [RFC3261].\n"
- title: 2.  Definition
  contents:
  - "2.  Definition\n   The SIP MESSAGE mechanism defined in this document results\
    \ in the\n   sending of a SIP MESSAGE request to notify a recipient about an email\n\
    \   message.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Notify Parameter "method"
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Notify Parameter \"method\"\n   The \"method\" parameter MUST be a URI\
    \ that conforms to the SIP or SIPS\n   URI scheme (as specified in RFC 3261 [RFC3261])\
    \ and that identifies a\n   SIP or SIPS recipient of the notification.  The URI\
    \ MAY include the\n   resource identifier portion of a SIP address and URI parameters.\
    \  The\n   URI MUST include the URI parameter \"method\", with the value\n   \"\
    MESSAGE\".  Example:\n         notify \"sip:romeo@example.com;method=MESSAGE\"\
    \n                                       --------------\n   Note that future specifications\
    \ might extend this document and define\n   Sieve notifications that use SIP methods\
    \ other than \"MESSAGE\".\n   The processing application MUST form a request according\
    \ to the rules\n   specified in RFC 3261 [RFC3261].\n   Note that other URI schemes\
    \ can also trigger SIP processing, but only\n   SIP and SIPS are defined here.\
    \  Future extensions might define other\n   Sieve notification methods that use\
    \ SIP through other URI schemes.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Notify Tag ":from"
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Notify Tag \":from\"\n   The value of the \":from\" tag MUST use the SIP\
    \ \"From\" header field\n   syntax; if the \":from\" value is specified, has valid\
    \ syntax, and is\n   valid according to the implementation-specific security checks\
    \ (see\n   Section 3.3 of Sieve Notify [RFC5435]), then the notification SHOULD\n\
    \   include the \"From\" SIP header field containing the value of the\n   \":from\"\
    \ notify tag.  If the specified value is not valid, then it is\n   ignored.\n\
    \   All SIP authentication, including challenges and client certificates,\n  \
    \ SHOULD be done in the context of the Sieve engine -- the Sieve engine\n   is\
    \ the identity being authenticated.  This avoids security issues\n   associated\
    \ with the Sieve engine's having access to the end user's\n   SIP authentication\
    \ credentials.  The Sieve engine MAY use server-wide\n   credentials (including\
    \ applicable certificates) that are the same for\n   all scripts.  Alternatively,\
    \ it MAY, for auditing purposes, use\n   different sets of Sieve-engine credentials\
    \ when operating on behalf\n   of different users.\n   See Section 22 of RFC 3261\
    \ [RFC3261] for more information about SIP\n   authentication.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Notify Tag ":options"
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Notify Tag \":options\"\n   Handling of the \":options\" tag is implementation\
    \ specific.  This\n   document doesn't require presence of any option and doesn't\
    \ define\n   how options are processed.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Notify Tag ":importance"
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Notify Tag \":importance\"\n   The \":importance\" tag is intended to convey\
    \ the importance of the SIP\n   MESSAGE notification, not the importance of the\
    \ email message that\n   generated the notification.  The value of the \":importance\"\
    \ tag MAY,\n   therefore, be transformed into SIP \"Priority\" header field (in\n\
    \   addition to or instead of including it in the body of the message).\n   Note\
    \ that because the Sieve \":importance\" tag only has three values,\n   not all\
    \ SIP \"Priority\" values can be represented in the\n   transformation.  If this\
    \ transformation is done, the value of the\n   \"Priority\" header field MUST\
    \ be \"urgent\" if the value of the\n   \":importance\" tag is \"1\", \"normal\"\
    \ if the value of the \":importance\"\n   tag is \"2\", and \"non-urgent\" if\
    \ the value of the \":importance\" tag is\n   \"3\".  There is no mapping to the\
    \ SIP value \"emergency\", nor to any\n   additional values that might be defined.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Notify tag ":message"
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Notify tag \":message\"\n   If the \":message\" tag is included, it MUST\
    \ be transformed into the\n   message body of a SIP MESSAGE, which MUST have Content-Type\
    \ value of\n   \"text/plain\" with CHARSET=\"UTF-8\".  If the \":message\" tag\
    \ is not\n   included, a default message will be used.  The values of the \"From\"\
    \n   and \"Subject\" header fields of the triggering email message are\n   particularly\
    \ useful to users receiving notifications, and including\n   them in the default\
    \ message is generally a good idea, as shown in\n   Section 3.2 below.  (However,\
    \ see the Security Considerations,\n   Section 5.)  The default body might also\
    \ include the value of the\n   \":importance\" tag, if one is specified.\n   Note\
    \ that in no case is the actual triggering message body included\n   in the notification.\n\
    \   Implementations MUST comply with the SIP MESSAGE size limits, as\n   discussed\
    \ in Section 8 of RFC 3428 [RFC3428].\n"
- title: 2.6.  Other Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Other Definitions\n   An implementation MUST ignore any URI parameter it\
    \ does not\n   understand (the URI MUST be processed as if the parameter were\
    \ not\n   present).  The URI \"body\" parameter can serve the same purpose as\
    \ the\n   Sieve \":message\" tag, providing the message body of the SIP MESSAGE\n\
    \   request.  If both are present at the same time, the Sieve processing\n   MUST\
    \ ignore the \"body\" parameter.\n   Using the \":message\" tag has advantages\
    \ over using the \"body\"\n   parameter.  Because the \":message\" tag is part\
    \ of the \"notify\"\n   statement syntax, it can be easier to include it in a\
    \ script, and to\n   do things such as variable substitutions [RFC5229] with it.\
    \  It is\n   also easier to include non-ASCII characters in the \":message\" tag\n\
    \   because such characters have to be encoded if they are within URI\n   parameters,\
    \ but can be included directly in UTF-8 in Sieve tag\n   values.\n   The policy\
    \ for retrying delivery of failed notifications is specified\n   in RFC 3261 [RFC3261],\
    \ according to the SIP error code returned\n   during an attempt to deliver a\
    \ SIP notification.  In other words,\n   unlike the situation with some other\
    \ Sieve notification methods,\n   retries for SIP MESSAGE notifications are controlled\
    \ by the\n   notification protocol itself (SIP).\n"
- title: 2.7.  Test notify_method_capability
  contents:
  - "2.7.  Test notify_method_capability\n   Absent use of SIP extensions such as\
    \ [RFC3856], it is impossible to\n   tell in advance whether the notification\
    \ recipient is online and able\n   to receive a SIP MESSAGE.  Expect the notify_method_capability\
    \ test\n   for \"online\" to frequently return \"maybe\" for this notification\n\
    \   method.\n"
- title: 3.  Examples
  contents:
  - "3.  Examples\n   In the following examples, the sender of the email has an address\
    \ of\n   juliet@example.org, the entity to be notified has a SIP address of\n\

- title: 4.  Requirements Conformance Checklist
  contents:
  - "4.  Requirements Conformance Checklist\n   Section 3.8 of Sieve Notify [RFC5435]\
    \ specifies a set of requirements\n   for Sieve notification methods.  A checklist\
    \ is provided here to show\n   conformance of the SIP MESSAGE notification method.\n\
    \   1.   No new Sieve tags have been added to the \"notify\" action.\n   2.  \
    \ An implementation of the SIP MESSAGE notification method SHOULD\n        NOT\
    \ modify the final notification text, except to comply with\n        SIP MESSAGE\
    \ length limits.  Deployments MAY make operational\n        decisions about notification\
    \ text, for reasons such as privacy\n        and confidentiality.  Modification\
    \ of characters themselves\n        should not be necessary, since the SIP MESSAGE\
    \ body is encoded\n        in UTF-8 [RFC3629].\n   3.   An implementation MAY\
    \ ignore parameters specified in the\n        \":importance\" and \":options\"\
    \ tags.\n   4.   A default message is suggested in Section 2.5.\n   5.   A notification\
    \ sent via the SIP MESSAGE notification method MAY\n        include the Date header\
    \ field containing the date-time of the\n        moment when the SIP MESSAGE notification\
    \ was generated.\n   6.   The notification source is identified through the SIP\
    \ \"From:\"\n        header field, via the Sieve Notify \":from\" tag (see\n \
    \       Section 2.2).\n   7.   An implementation MUST NOT include any extraneous\
    \ information\n        not specified in parameters to the notify action.\n   8.\
    \   An implementation MUST ignore any URI parameters it does not\n        understand\
    \ (i.e., the URI MUST be processed as if the action or\n        parameter were\
    \ not present).  See Section 2.6 for more details.\n   9.   The notify_method_capability\
    \ test for the \"online\" notification-\n        capability behaves as described\
    \ in Section 2.7.\n   10.  The policy for retrying delivery of failed notifications\
    \ is\n        specified in RFC 3261 [RFC3261], as noted in Section 2.6.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Depending on the information included, sending\
    \ a notification can be,\n   from a confidentiality point of view, comparable\
    \ to forwarding mail\n   to the notification recipient.  Care must be taken when\
    \ automatically\n   forwarding information, such as the sender and the subject\
    \ of a\n   message, to ensure that confidential information is not sent into an\n\
    \   insecure environment or over an insecure channel.  Depending upon the\n  \
    \ environment, this might entail using SIPS URIs, not sending\n   information\
    \ about the subject and/or the sender, or applying\n   heuristics to the message\
    \ to determine what may be sent.\n   As required by RFC 3428, user agents that\
    \ support the SIP MESSAGE\n   request MUST implement end-to-end authentication,\
    \ body integrity, and\n   body confidentiality mechanisms.  At the time of this\
    \ writing, there\n   is not widespread deployment of SIP end-to-end security,\
    \ so there can\n   be cases where it is not possible to use it, even though it\
    \ is\n   implemented on one end.  It's important to note that such situations\n\
    \   are open to exposure of user credentials, message content, and other\n   private\
    \ information via man-in-the-middle and other passive attacks.\n   The Sieve Notify\
    \ extension specifies that notification methods MUST\n   provide mechanisms for\
    \ avoiding notification loops.  In this case,\n   the SIP protocol itself prevents\
    \ loops, and no explicit work is\n   needed within the notification mechanism.\
    \  In situations where a SIP\n   MESSAGE notification can result in an email message\
    \ that could\n   generate another SIP MESSAGE notification, loop prevention through\n\
    \   rate detection and limiting might be necessary.  An implementation\n   might\
    \ detect too many notifications within a given time period, too\n   many triggered\
    \ by a particular sender, too many with the same\n   subject, or the like, and\
    \ shut off the affected notifications for a\n   period of time or until manual\
    \ intervention turns them back on.\n   If SIP MESSAGE requests might be billed\
    \ by the message, or the use of\n   them might deplete a user's quota of messages,\
    \ notification by this\n   mechanism can present a situation where someone using\
    \ a large number\n   of messages to generate a large number of notifications will\
    \ cause a\n   significant expense to the recipient.  Because there is no external\n\
    \   way an attacker can tell that this is the case, such an attack would\n   likely\
    \ be a random or nuisance attack.  Nevertheless, users might be\n   warned of\
    \ potential costs when they set up SIP MESSAGE notifications.\n   Other security\
    \ considerations given in the Sieve base specification\n   [RFC5228], the Sieve\
    \ Notify extension [RFC5435], and RFC 3261\n   [RFC3261] are also relevant to\
    \ this document.\n"
