  - "1. Introduction\n   The message/sip MIME media type defined in [1] carries an\
    \ entire well\n   formed SIP message.  Section 23.4 of [1] describes the use of\n\
    \   message/sip in concert with S/MIME  to enhance end-to-end security.\n   The\
    \ concepts in that section can be extended to allow SIP entities to\n   make assertions\
    \ about a subset of a SIP message (for example, as\n   described in [6]).  The\
    \ message/sipfrag type defined in this document\n   is used to represent this\
    \ subset.\n   A subset of a SIP message is also used by the REFER method defined\
    \ in\n   [5] to carry the status of referenced requests.  Allowing only a\n  \
    \ portion of a SIP message to be carried allows information that could\n   compromise\
    \ privacy and confidentiality to be protected by removal.\n   This document does\
    \ NOT provide a mechanism to segment a SIP message\n   into multiple pieces for\
    \ separate transport and later reassemble.\n   The message/partial type defined\
    \ in [2] provides a solution for that\n   problem.\n   The key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMEND\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to\
    \ be interpreted as described in [4].\n"

  - "2. Definition: message/sipfrag\n   A valid message/sipfrag part is one that could\
    \ be obtained by\n   starting with some valid SIP message and deleting any of\
    \ the\n   following:\n   o  the entire start line\n   o  one or more entire header\
    \ fields\n   o  the body\n   The following Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [3]\
    \ rule describes a\n   message/sipfrag part using the SIP grammar elements defined\
    \ in [1].\n   The expansion of any element is subject to the restrictions on valid\n\
    \   SIP messages defined there.\n           sipfrag = [ start-line ]\n       \
    \              *message-header\n                     [ CRLF [ message-body ] ]\n\
    \   If the message/sipfrag part contains a body, it MUST also contain the\n  \
    \ appropriate header fields describing that body (such as Content-\n   Length)\
    \ as required by Section 7.4 of [1] and the null-line\n   separating the header\
    \ from the body.\n"

- title: 4. Discussion
  contents:
  - "4. Discussion\n   Section 23 of [1], and memos [5] and [6] provide motivation\
    \ and\n   detailed examples of carrying all or part of a SIP message in a MIME\n\
    \   part.  Briefly, using this representation along with S/MIME enables\n   protecting\
    \ and making assertions about portions of a SIP message\n   header.  It also enables\
    \ applications to describe the messaging\n   involved in a SIP transaction using\
    \ portions of the messages\n   themselves.\n   The SIP REFER method [5], for instance,\
    \ uses this to report the\n   result of a SIP request to an authorized third party.\
    \  However, as\n   that document details, it is rarely desirable to include the\
    \ entire\n   SIP response message in this report as a message/sip MIME part.\n\
    \   Doing so has significant negative security implications.  The\n   message/sipfrag\
    \ type, on the other hand, allows a sender to select\n   what information is exposed.\
    \  Further, it allows information required\n   in a full SIP message that is not\
    \ pertinent to a description of that\n   message to be elided, reducing message\
    \ size.  For instance, this\n   allows a SIP element responding to a REFER to\
    \ say \"I got a 400 Bad\n   Request with this Warning header field\" without having\
    \ to include the\n   Via, To, From, Call-ID, CSeq and Content-Length header fields\n\
    \   mandatory in a full SIP message.\n   The message protection mechanism discussed\
    \ in Section 23 of [1]\n   assumes an entire SIP message is being protected. \
    \ However, there are\n   several header fields in a full SIP message that necessarily\
    \ change\n   during transport.  [1] discusses how to inspect and ignore those\n\
    \   changes.  This idea is refined in [6] to allow protection of a subset\n  \
    \ of the entire message, avoiding the extra work and potential errors\n   involved\
    \ in ignoring parts of the message that may legitimately\n   change in transit.\
    \  That document also describes constructing\n   cryptographic assertions about\
    \ pertinent subsets of a SIP message\n   header before the full header (including\
    \ hop-by-hop transport\n   specific information) may be available.\n"
- title: 5. IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. IANA Considerations\n   The message/sipfrag media type is defined by the following\n\
    \   information:\n   Media type name: message\n   Media subtype name: sipfrag\n\
    \   Required parameters: none\n   Optional parameters: version\n     Version:\
    \ The SIP-Version number of the enclosed message (e.g.,\n     \"2.0\"). If not\
    \ present, the version defaults to \"2.0\".\n   Encoding scheme: SIP messages\
    \ consist of an 8-bit header optionally\n     followed by a binary MIME data object.\
    \ As such, SIP messages must\n     be treated as binary. Under normal circumstances\
    \ SIP messages are\n     transported over binary-capable transports, no special\
    \ encodings\n     are needed.\n   Security considerations: see below\n"
- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   A message/sipfrag mime-part may contain sensitive\
    \ information or\n   information used to affect processing decisions at the receiver.\n\
    \   When exposing that information or modifying it during transport would\n  \
    \ do harm, its level of protection can be improved using the S/MIME\n   mechanisms\
    \ described in section 23 of [1], with the limitations\n   described in section\
    \ 26 of that document, and the mechanisms\n   described in [6].\n   Applications\
    \ using message/sipfrag to represent a subset of the\n   header fields from a\
    \ SIP message must consider the implications of\n   the message/sipfrag part being\
    \ captured and replayed and include\n   sufficient information to mitigate risk.\
    \  Any SIP extension which\n   uses message/sipfrag MUST describe the replay and\
    \ cut and paste\n   threats unique to its particular usage.  For example, [6]\
    \ discusses\n   how a subset of a SIP message can be used to assert the identity\
    \ of\n   the entity making a SIP request.  The draft details what information\n\
    \   must be contained in the subset to bind the assertion to the request.\n"
