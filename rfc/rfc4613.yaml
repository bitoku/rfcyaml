  - "1.  Introduction\n   The present document seeks to register a media type for\
    \ Downloadable\n   Sounds (DLSes).  The DLS format is used to define instruments\
    \ for\n   widely used wavetable synthesizers associated with the standards\n \
    \  [DLS1, DLS2, MDLS].  DLSes and their associated standards are\n   maintained\
    \ and defined by two organizations, the Musical Instrument\n   Digital Interface\
    \ (MIDI) Manufacturers Association (MMA) and the\n   Association of the Musical\
    \ Electronics Industry (AMEI).\n   The media type defined here is needed to identify\
    \ DLS files correctly\n   when they are served over HTTP, included in multi-part\
    \ documents, or\n   used in other places where media types are used.\n"
- title: 2.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  Security Considerations\n   The DLS format may contain audio, displayable\
    \ text data, and modeling\n   parameters (a.k.a. articulation parameters).  In\
    \ addition, the DLS\n   format contains a so-called conditional chunk that is\
    \ 'active' in the\n   sense that it affects the execution of a DLS file parser.\
    \  However,\n   the DLS format does not currently define any scripting mechanism.\n\
    \   Clearly, it is possible to author malicious files that, for example,\n   contain\
    \ large amounts of data always blocked by a conditional\n   statement; i.e., no\
    \ synthesizer loads the instruments.\n   However, for DLS, clients can and usually\
    \ do protect themselves\n   against these kinds of attacks.  A key point is that\
    \ conditional\n   chunks are optional, that is, a parser does not have to execute\
    \ a\n   conditional chunk.  However, if a parser evaluates a conditional\n   chunk,\
    \ it is still possible to parse its content and draw to a\n   conclusion as to\
    \ whether it is usable for a particular synthesizer\n   engine.\n   Note that\
    \ selected metadata fields may include information partly\n   intended to protect\
    \ the media against unauthorized use or\n   distribution.  In this case, the intention\
    \ is that alteration or\n   removal of the data in the field would be treated\
    \ as an offense under\n   national agreements based on World Intellectual Property\
    \ Organization\n   (WIPO) treaties.\n   DLS have an extensible structure, making\
    \ it theoretically possible to\n   define metadata fields or media formats in\
    \ the future that could be\n   used to induce particular actions of the recipient,\
    \ and thus that\n   would present additional security risks.  However, this type\
    \ of\n   capability is currently not supported in the referenced\n   specifications.\n\
    \   There is no current provision in the DLS standard for encryption,\n   signing,\
    \ or authentication within the file formats.\n"
- title: 3.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   The IANA has registered the media type audio/dls,\
    \ as specified in\n   Section 3.1.  The registration uses the template present\
    \ in\n   [RFC4288].\n"
