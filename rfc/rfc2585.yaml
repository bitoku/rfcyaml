- title: 1.2.  Certificate and CRL Repository
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Certificate and CRL Repository\n   Some CAs mandate the use of on-line\
    \ validation services, while others\n   distribute CRLs to allow certificate users\
    \ to perform certificate\n   validation themselves.  In general, CAs make CRLs\
    \ available to\n   certificate users by publishing them in the Directory.  The\
    \ Directory\n   is also the normal distribution mechanism for certificates.  However,\n\
    \   Directory Services are not available in many parts of the Internet\n   today.\
    \ The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) defined in RFC 959 and the\n   Hypertext Transfer\
    \ Protocol (HTTP) defined in RFC 2068 offer\n   alternate methods for certificate\
    \ and CRL distribution.\n   End entities and CAs may retrieve certificates and\
    \ CRLs from the\n   repository using FTP or HTTP.  End entities may publish their\
    \ own\n   certificate in the repository using FTP or HTTP, and RAs and CAs may\n\
    \   publish certificates and CRLs in the repository using FTP or HTTP.\n"
- title: 2  FTP Conventions
  contents:
  - "2  FTP Conventions\n   Within certificate extensions and CRL extensions, the\
    \ URI form of\n   GeneralName is used to specify the location where issuer certificates\n\
    \   and CRLs may be obtained.  For instance, a URI identifying the\n   subject\
    \ of a certificate may be carried in subjectAltName certificate\n   extension.\
    \ An IA5String describes the use of anonymous FTP to fetch\n   certificate or\
    \ CRL information.  For example:\n      ftp://ftp.netcom.com/sp/spyrus/housley.cer\n\
    \      ftp://ftp.your.org/pki/id48.cer\n      ftp://ftp.your.org/pki/id48.no42.crl\n\
    \   Internet users may publish the URI reference to a file that contains\n   their\
    \ certificate on their business card.  This practice is useful\n   when there\
    \ is no Directory entry for that user.  FTP is widely\n   deployed, and anonymous\
    \ FTP are accommodated by many firewalls.\n   Thus, FTP is an attractive alternative\
    \ to Directory access protocols\n   for certificate and CRL distribution.  While\
    \ this service satisfies\n   the requirement to retrieve information related to\
    \ a certificate\n   which is already identified by a URI, it is not intended to\
    \ satisfy\n   the more general problem of finding a certificate for a user about\n\
    \   whom some other information, such as their electronic mail address or\n  \
    \ corporate affiliation, is known.\n   For convenience, the names of files that\
    \ contain certificates should\n   have a suffix of \".cer\".  Each \".cer\" file\
    \ contains exactly one\n   certificate, encoded in DER format.  Likewise, the\
    \ names of files\n   that contain CRLs should have a suffix of \".crl\".  Each\
    \ \".crl\" file\n   contains exactly one CRL, encoded in DER format.\n"

- title: Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "Security Considerations\n   Since certificates and CRLs are digitally signed,\
    \ no additional\n   integrity service is necessary.  Neither certificates nor\
    \ CRLs need\n   be kept secret, and anonymous access to certificates and CRLs\
    \ is\n   generally acceptable.  Thus, no privacy service is necessary.\n   HTTP\
    \ caching proxies are common on the Internet, and some proxies do\n   not check\
    \ for the latest version of an object correctly. If an HTTP\n   request for a\
    \ certificate or CRL goes through a misconfigured or\n   otherwise broken proxy,\
    \ the proxy may return an out-of-date response.\n   Operators of FTP sites and\
    \ World Wide Web servers should authenticate\n   end entities who publish certificates\
    \ as well as CAs and RAs who\n   publish certificates and CRLs.  However, authentication\
    \ is not\n   necessary to retrieve certificates and CRLs.\n"
