  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines a number of Quality of Service (QoS)\
    \ parameters\n   that can be reused for conveying QoS information within the Diameter\n\
    \   protocol [RFC3588].  The current set of QoS parameters defined in\n   this\
    \ document are a core subset determined to be useful for a wide\n   range of applications.\
    \  Additional parameters may be defined in\n   future documents as the need arises\
    \ and are for future study.  The\n   parameters are defined as Diameter-encoded\
    \ Attribute Value Pairs\n   (AVPs), which are described using a modified version\
    \ of the Augmented\n   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF), see [RFC3588].  The data types\
    \ are also\n   taken from [RFC3588].\n   The traffic model (TMOD) AVPs are containers\
    \ consisting of four AVPs\n   and provide a way to describe the traffic source.\n\
    \   o  token rate (r)\n   o  bucket depth (b)\n   o  peak traffic rate (p)\n \
    \  o  minimum policed unit (m)\n   o  maximum packet size (M)\n   The encoding\
    \ of the <TMOD-1> and the <TMOD-2> AVPs can be found in\n   Sections 3.1 and 3.2.\
    \  The semantics of these two AVPs are described\n   in Section 3.1 of [RFC2210]\
    \ and in Section 3.6 of [RFC2215].\n   The <TMOD-2> AVP is, for example, needed\
    \ by some DiffServ\n   applications.\n      It is typically assumed that DiffServ\
    \ expedited forwarding (EF)\n      traffic is shaped at the ingress by a single-rate\
    \ token bucket.\n      Therefore, a single TMOD parameter is sufficient to signal\n\
    \      DiffServ EF traffic.  However, for DiffServ assured forwarding\n      (AF)\
    \ traffic, two sets of token bucket parameters are needed: one\n      token bucket\
    \ for the average traffic and one token bucket for the\n      burst traffic. \
    \ [RFC2697] defines a Single Rate Three Color Marker\n      (srTCM), which meters\
    \ a traffic stream and marks its packets\n      according to three traffic parameters\
    \ -- Committed Information\n      Rate (CIR), Committed Burst Size (CBS), and\
    \ Excess Burst Size\n      (EBS) -- to be either green, yellow, or red.  A packet\
    \ is marked\n      green if it does not exceed the CBS, yellow if it does exceed\
    \ the\n      CBS but not the EBS, and red otherwise.  [RFC2697] defines\n    \
    \  specific procedures using two token buckets that run at the same\n      rate.\
    \  Therefore, two TMOD AVPs are sufficient to distinguish\n      among three levels\
    \ of drop precedence.  An example is also\n      described in the appendix of\
    \ [RFC2597].\n   Resource reservations might refer to a packet processor with\
    \ a\n   particular DiffServ per-hop behavior (PHB) (using the <PHB-Class>\n  \
    \ AVP).  A generic description of the DiffServ architecture can be\n   found in\
    \ [RFC2475], and the Differentiated Services Field is\n   described in Section\
    \ 3 of [RFC2474].  Updated terminology can be\n   found in [RFC3260].  Standardized\
    \ per-hop behavior is, for example,\n   described in [RFC2597] (\"Assured Forwarding\
    \ PHB Group\") and in\n   [RFC3246] (\"An Expedited Forwarding PHB\").\n   The\
    \ above-mentioned parameters are intended to support basic\n   integrated and\
    \ differentiated services functionality in the network.\n   Additional parameters\
    \ can be defined and standardized if required to\n   support specific services\
    \ in the future.\n"

- title: 4.  Extensibility
  contents:
  - "4.  Extensibility\n   This document is designed with extensibility in mind, given\
    \ that\n   different organizations and groups are used to defining their own\n\
    \   Quality of Service parameters.  This document provides an initial QoS\n  \
    \ profile with a common set of parameters.  Ideally, these parameters\n   should\
    \ be used whenever possible, but there are cases where\n   additional parameters\
    \ might be needed or where the parameters\n   specified in this document are used\
    \ with different semantics.  In\n   that case, it is advisable to define a new\
    \ QoS profile that may\n   consist of new parameters in addition to parameters\
    \ defined in this\n   document or an entirely different set of parameters.  Finally,\
    \ it is\n   also possible to register a specific QoS profile that defines a\n\
    \   specific set of QoS values rather than parameters that need to be\n   filled\
    \ with values in order to be used.\n   To enable the definition of new QoS profiles,\
    \ an 8-octet registry is\n   defined as a field that is represented by 4-octet\
    \ vendor and 4-octet\n   specifier fields.  The vendor field contains an Enterprise\
    \ Number as\n   defined in [RFC2578], taken from the values maintained in the\
    \ IANA\n   Enterprise Numbers registry.  If the four octets of the vendor field\n\
    \   are 0x00000000 (reserved value for IANA), then the value in the\n   specifier\
    \ field MUST be registered with IANA (see Section 5.2).  If\n   the vendor field\
    \ is other than 0x00000000, the value of the specifier\n   field represents a\
    \ vendor-specific value, where allocation is the\n   responsibility of the enterprise\
    \ indicated in the vendor field.\n"
