    \ for\n   the National Computerization Agency (NCA) for naming persistent\n  \

    \ types of digital resources produced or managed by NCA.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   NCA is a non-profit organization with a mandate to develop\
    \ and\n   promote information infrastructure and manage public digital contents\n\
    \   in Korea and possibly worldwide.\n   NCA has been supervising digitalization\
    \ projects with various\n   organizations.  The contents involved in such projects\
    \ include\n   millions of technical papers, cultural properties, educational\n\
    \   materials, scientific research reports.  Those organizations manage\n   the\
    \ digital contents in a standardized way set by NCA and provide\n   users with\
    \ various content services via internet.\n   NCA wishes to issue globally unique\
    \ and persistent IDs to digital\n   resources and assign relevant organizations\
    \ as its registration\n   agencies under the Universal Content Identifier (UCI)\
    \ scheme.  It is\n   beneficial for NCA, its registration agencies, and the value\
    \ chain\n   players in e-commerce, to have the UCI URN namespace, under which\
    \ all\n   the contents and components produced and managed by NCA are digitally\n\
    \   registered, identified, and resolved.\n   NCA has been developing and operating\
    \ the UCI system that provides\n   registration, resolution, search, and administration\
    \ functionalities.\n   The functionalities are going to be added and modified\
    \ once the use\n   of UCI URN namespace is approved.  NCA would like to assign\
    \ unique,\n   permanent, and location-independent names based on the URNs for\
    \ the\n   resources it produces or manages.  See\n   http://www.nca.or.kr/eindex.htm\
    \ for more information on NCA.\n   This namespace specification is for a formal\
    \ namespace.\n"

    \ or <http://home.uci.or.kr>\n   Declaration of syntactic structure:\n      The\
    \ Namespace specific string of all URNs assigned by NCA conforms\n      to the\
    \ syntax defined in section 2.2. of RFC2141, \"URN Syntax\"[1].\n      The syntax\
    \ convention is described in the form of ABNF rules [2]\n      as the following.\n\
    \      UCI = prefix \"-\" instance *1(\":\" qualifier)\n      prefix = 1*(alphaDigit)\
    \ *1(\":\" 1*(alphaDigit))\n               *1(\"+\" 1*(alphaDigit))\n      instance\
    \ = 1*(trans / \"%\" HEXDIG HEXDIG)\n      qualifier = head 1*(alphaDigit) *2(\"\
    -\" head 1*(alphaDigit))\n      trans = alphaDigit / other\n      alphaDigit =\
    \ ALPHA / DIGIT\n      head = \"C\" / \"R\" / \"F\"\n      other = \"(\" / \"\
    )\" / \"+\" / \",\" / \"-\" / \".\" / \"=\" / \"@\" /\n              \";\" / \"\
    $\" / \"_\" / \"!\" / \"*\" / \"'\"\n      The UCI identifier consists of two\
    \ parts: prefix code and content\n      code.  The content code is also divided\
    \ into instance code and\n      qualifier code, which is optional.  A prefix code\
    \ is given to a\n      registration agency, subordinate registration agency, and/or\
    \ its\n      registrants such as 'G3000+music', 'I600', 'I500+paper', and so\n\
    \      forth.  A content code is issued to each individual digital\n      resource\
    \ such as 'cii90007', '8987409', and so on.\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n\
    \      None.\n   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n      It is the responsibility\
    \ of the registration authority, or NCA, to\n      guarantee the uniqueness of\
    \ identifiers and the names of\n      subordinate naming authorities.  For example,\
    \ a software tool\n      developed and used by NCA checks if a UCI identifier\
    \ is being\n      reassigned and verifies that it is assigned to at most one\n\
    \      resource during the registration process.\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n\
    \      Registration Agencies are all eligible to maintain the usability\n    \
    \  of the UCI URNs for a reasonably long period.  As a government\n      sponsored\
    \ organization, NCA will operate a backup service and make\n      an effort to\
    \ find a substitute in case a registration agency\n      becomes out of operation.\n\
    \   Process of identifier assignment:\n      Assignment of UCI identifier is delegated\
    \ to the registration\n      agencies.  NCA appoints UCI registration agencies\
    \ and provides its\n      namespace by assigning a unique registration agency\
    \ code that is a\n      part of NSS.  Followed by the authorized namespace, each\n\
    \      registration agency sets its own identifier scheme that conforms\n    \
    \  to the UCI syntactic structure.\n      A UCI for a digital resource is issued\
    \ by the registration agency,\n      upon a request of a registrant.  The following\
    \ is an example\n      identifier.\n      e.g., urn:uci:I700-2987098\n      where,\
    \ I700 is a registration agency code and 2987098 is an\n      identifier assigned\
    \ to a digital content.\n   Process for identifier resolution:\n      Resolution\
    \ is controlled by NCA and its delegatees.  The list of\n      UCI registration\
    \ agency codes is maintained by the registration\n      authority.  Each registration\
    \ agency maintains the list of\n      subordinate registrant codes and identifiers\
    \ registered to the\n      registration agency.\n      Identifier resolution steps\
    \ are as follows.\n      - (Step1) Global resolution: NCA resolves which RA is\
    \ dealing with\n        the associated resource by parsing the registration agency\
    \ code\n        of the UCI.\n      - (Step2) Local resolution: The corresponding\
    \ RA parses and\n        resolves the rest of the identifier\n      The global\
    \ resolution is performed by UCI resolution server that\n      is open to public.\
    \ (Currently http://rootadmin.uci.or.kr:9000/\n      {UCI identifier} will give\
    \ you resolution results.)\n   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n      The \"prefix\"\
    \ is case-insensitive.  So there will not be two\n      registration agencies\
    \ whose names differ only in case.\n         urn:uci:{prefix code}:\n      is\
    \ case-insensitive for matches.  Remainder of the identifier is\n      case-sensitive.\n\
    \   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n      The UCI syntax fully conforms to RFC2141\
    \ syntax rules for both NSS\n      and NID.\n   Validation mechanism:\n      Valid\
    \ list of prefix code will be available via both on-line and\n      off-line upon\
    \ request.  The validity of the rest of identifier can\n      be offered via on-line\
    \ service. (Currently at http://rootadmin.\n      uci.or.kr:9000/{UCI identifier}\
    \ by typing a query UCI identifier)\n   Scope:\n      Global.\n"

  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   There are no additional security considerations\
    \ beyond those normally\n   associated with the use and resolution of URNs in\
    \ general.\n"
- title: 4.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Namespace Considerations\n   The Korean government has been funding the UCI\
    \ project with the\n   vision that it will be an essential component in realizing\n\
    \   interoperability of digital contents owned by individual institutes\n   and\
    \ organizations.  The resolution service provided by NCA and its\n   registration\
    \ agencies via networks will play a central role in\n   achieving such a goal.\
    \  Moreover, the resolution service is open to\n   the public without discrimination.\n\
    \   The assignment and use of identifiers is performed according to the\n   rules\
    \ established by NCA.  It abides by the URN requirements and\n   syntax.  Within\
    \ a UCI namespace, a registration agency manages\n   subordinate namespaces and\
    \ maintains the metadata of digital\n   contents.\n   For making the service available\
    \ to the public, a global resolution\n   service is run by NCA through a service\
    \ server and local resolution\n   service is provided by the corresponding registration\
    \ agency.\n"
- title: 5.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Community Considerations\n   The assignment and use of identifiers within\
    \ the namespace are open,\n   and the related rule is established by NCA.  Registration\
    \ agencies\n   are evaluated and selected fairly and shall have the responsibility\n\
    \   of processing registrants' requests for registering digital contents.\n  \
    \ Registration authority and registration agencies shall operate\n   resolution\
    \ servers for UCI namespace and subordinate namespaces,\n   respectively.  Digital\
    \ content users can access the resolution\n   servers to fetch resolution results.\
    \  The reference software is\n   developed, and resolution servers are now in\
    \ operation.\n"
