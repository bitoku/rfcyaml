  contents:
  - "3.  Overview\n   This MIB module provides a set of objects required for the management\n\
    \   of DOCSIS Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTS).  The specification\n   is\
    \ derived in part from the operational model described in the DOCSIS\n   Radio\
    \ Frequency Interface Specification [ITU-T-J122].  These managed\n   objects facilitate\
    \ protection of the cable network from misuse by\n   subscribers.  This misuse\
    \ might include, for example, address\n   spoofing, service spoofing, or operation\
    \ of unauthorized services.\n   The following figure illustrates the operational\
    \ and physical\n   deployment relationships between elements in a cable modem\
    \ network.\n   This MIB module resides at the CMTS, which is the first point in\
    \ the\n   public data network at which the cable operator controls physical\n\
    \   access.  The CMTS (possibly assisted by other IP service devices)\n   acts\
    \ as a network edge, separating the physical outside-plant cable\n   television\
    \ network from the operator's IP network.\n                    |             \
    \ operator's IP network\n                 +------+          ---------------------\n\

    \           |        |        |     subscriber host or network\n   This MIB module\
    \ controls IP packet forwarding to and from each cable\n   modem, at the CMTS.\
    \  Different modems may be accorded different\n   treatment.\n   Much of this\
    \ module duplicates capabilities found in the DOCSIS Cable\n   Device MIB [RFC2669].\
    \  Although it is expected that the Cable Device\n   MIB will be used to prevent\
    \ unwanted traffic from entering the cable\n   network, it is also possible that\
    \ a malicious user might tamper with\n   cable modem software, disabling its filtering\
    \ policies.  This MIB\n   provides a more secure mechanism, as physical access\
    \ to the CMTS is\n   controlled by the network operator.\n   In particular, this\
    \ MIB provides two capabilities: first, to limit\n   the IP addresses behind a\
    \ modem, and second, to provide address and\n   protocol filtering to and from\
    \ a modem.  The first duplicates the\n   capabilities of the docsDevCpe group\
    \ [RFC2669].  This provides for\n   either learned or provisioned subscriber premises\
    \ host IP addresses\n   behind a cable modem.\n   The address and protocol filtering\
    \ capability is similar to that\n   performed by the cable modem itself.  It differs\
    \ in several respects\n   because it is intended to control subscriber traffic\
    \ at the CMTS,\n   rather than at the individual CM.  First, the MIB structure\
    \ must be\n   indexed appropriately at the CMTS to indicate which cable modem\n\
    \   subscriber is intended.  Second, rather than maintaining a separate\n   list\
    \ of filters for each modem at the CMTS, it is assumed that large\n   numbers\
    \ of modems will share filtering characteristics.  Therefore,\n   modems are grouped\
    \ so as to share common filter lists.\n   The filtering capability is implemented\
    \ using the Classification,\n   Counting, and Drop facilities of the Differentiated\
    \ Services MIB\n   [RFC3289].  In order to provide different filtering for various\n\
    \   classes of subscribers, this MIB defines the\n   docsSubMgtFilterGroupTable,\
    \ which specifies which filters apply to\n   each subscriber packet.  This table\
    \ is used by RFC 3289 as a first\n   pass of classification, and also to choose\
    \ a second pass of\n   classification using the diffServMultiFieldClfrTable:\n\
    \    diffServDataPathStart --> diffServClfrEntry(1)\n    diffServClfrElementSpecific(1)\
    \ --> docsSubMgtFilterGroupIndex\n    diffServClfrElementNext(1) --> diffServClfrEntry(2)\n\
    \    diffServClfrElementSpecific(2)--> diffServMultiFieldClfrEntry\n    diffServClfrElementNext(2)\
    \ --> difServActionEntry (count or algDrop)\n   Because it is assumed that large\
    \ numbers of modems will share\n   filtering characteristics, DOCSIS signaling\
    \ defines filter groups\n   according to which cable modems share common filter\
    \ lists.  The\n   operator creates references to these groups in the\n   diffServClfrElementSpecific(1)\
    \ entries above.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Structure of the MIB
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Structure of the MIB\n   This MIB is structured in four tables:\n   o \
    \ The docsSubMgtCpeControlTable controls the acceptance of\n      subscriber host\
    \ addresses behind a cable modem.\n   o  The docsSubMgtCpeIpTable monitors the\
    \ subscriber host addresses\n      that the CMTS believes exist behind the cable\
    \ modem.\n   o  The docsSubMgtCmFilterTable binds a cable modem to a set of\n\
    \      filters in diffServMultiFieldClfrTable.\n   o  The docsSubMgtFilterGroupTable\
    \ provides the OIDs by which the\n      diffServClfrElementTable selects a filter\
    \ group.\n   The docsSubMgtCpeControlTable and docsSubMgtCmFilterTable AUGMENT\
    \ the\n   docsIfCmtsCmStatusTable from [RFC2670].  Similarly,\n   docsSubMgtCpeIpTable\
    \ expands this table (an additional index is\n   used).  As such, each entry in\
    \ these tables is bound to a registered\n   cable modem, as perceived by the CMTS.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  docsSubMgtFilterGroupTable
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  docsSubMgtFilterGroupTable\n   The docsSubMgtFilterGroupTable links the\
    \ filter group (signaled by\n   DOCSIS as a small integer) to the diffServClfrElementEntry\
    \ for the\n   first pass of filter classification.  diffServClfrElementSpecific\n\
    \   requires a RowPointer.  Thus, this table exists to provide referenced\n  \
    \ objects for diffServClfrElementSpecific.  The classification method\n   is as\
    \ follows:\n   o  Use the DOCSIS filter group, as inferred from the sending or\n\
    \      receiving modem, as the classification criterion.\n   o  Use docsSubMgtFilterGroupIndex\
    \ as the value to match.\n   An entry exists in this Table if a reference to it\
    \ exists in\n   diffServClfrElementSpecific.\n   As such, contrary to common practice,\
    \ the index for the table is\n   read-only and is both the Entry's index and its\
    \ only value.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  IPv4 Compliance
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  IPv4 Compliance\n   Please note that the compliance statements in this\
    \ version of the MIB\n   module require support only for IPv4 addresses.  That\
    \ is because the\n   current version of the DOCSIS protocols (1.0, 1.1, and 2.0)\
    \ are not\n   IPv6 capable.  Although support for IPv6 will require changes to\
    \ the\n   DOCSIS protocols, it is expected that the only changes to the MIB\n\
    \   module itself will be the addition of new compliance statements that\n   mandate\
    \ support for IPv6 addresses.  All IP addresses that appear in\n   this document\
    \ conform to the textual conventions specified in\n   [RFC4001].\n"
- title: 3.2.  Management Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Management Requirements\n   The DOCSIS cable modem provisioning model [ITU-T-J122]\
    \ requires that\n   cable modems use TFTP to acquire a list of parameters.  The\
    \ modem\n   then passes many of these parameters to the CMTS in the DOCSIS\n \
    \  Registration message.  The parameter values are digitally signed by\n   the\
    \ creator of the TFTP contents, and the signature is verified by\n   the CMTS.\
    \  In general, then, the CMTS itself need not be configured\n   with the attributes\
    \ of its cable modems.  It will acquire these\n   values through the Registration\
    \ process that is secured by the\n   digital signature.\n   Cable modem subscriber\
    \ management, as described here, modifies this\n   process slightly to reduce\
    \ data and to ease administrative control.\n   Filtering criteria, for example,\
    \ are maintained through SNMP at the\n   CMTS, and the modem registration merely\
    \ signals the index values for\n   the rows that apply to that modem.\n"
- title: 3.2.1.  Interaction with DOCSIS Provisioning for CPE Address Control
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Interaction with DOCSIS Provisioning for CPE Address Control\n   The\
    \ CMTS creates rows in docsSubMgtCpeControlTable for each modem as\n   a result\
    \ of the DOCSIS registration process.  The DOCSIS registration\n   attributes\
    \ may include items semantically equivalent to those in the\n   docsDevCpe section\
    \ of the DOCSIS Cable Device MIB [RFC2669]:\n   o  docsDevCpeEnroll\n   o  docsDevCpeIpMax\n\
    \   o  docsDevCpeIp\n   Successful DOCSIS registration will have the effect of\
    \ setting the\n   corresponding fields in the docsSubMgtCpeControlTable and the\n\
    \   docsSubMgtCpeIpTable.  If they are not present at modem registration,\n  \
    \ the CMTS shall apply the following:\n   o  docsSubMgtCpeControlActive  <-- docsSubMgtCpeActiveDefault\n\
    \   o  docsSubMgtCpeControlMaxCpeIp <-- docsSubMgtCpeMaxIpDefault\n   o  docsSubMgtCpeControlLearnable\

    \ through any of three ways:\n   DOCSIS registration (as described above), learning\
    \ by the CMTS, or\n   some unspecified administrative mechanism on the CMTS. \
    \ The\n   docsDevCpeIpMax table bound applies only to the first two.\n   The CMTS\
    \ may learn addresses simply by snooping source IP addresses\n   from traffic\
    \ originating from each cable modem.  Other learning\n   mechanisms (for example,\
    \ ARP snooping) may be used.  The learning\n   mechanism is not defined by this\
    \ document.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Interaction with DOCSIS Provisioning for Filtering\n   Rows in docsSubMgtCmFilterTable\

    \ process.  The DOCSIS\n   registration attributes may include four indices (see\
    \ section\n   C.1.1.18.3 of [ITU-T-J122]):\n   o  One identifying the upstream\
    \ (ingress with respect to the CMTS\n      interface) filter group for packets\
    \ originating from the cable\n      modem (i.e., those packets whose source MAC\

- title: 3.2.3.  Distinguishing Modem from Subscriber Traffic
  contents:
  - "3.2.3.  Distinguishing Modem from Subscriber Traffic\n   All traffic originating\
    \ from or destined to a subscriber site is\n   potentially suspect and subject\
    \ to suppression by the network\n   operator.  This is true even if the traffic\
    \ is ostensibly sourced or\n   sunk by the cable modem itself, rather than by\
    \ the subscriber hosts\n   behind the modem.  To provide more nuanced administrative\
    \ control,\n   this document allows separate filter policies for modems and hosts.\n\
    \   For example, modem policies may limit modems to server subnet - only\n   access\
    \ while allowing a different scope to subscribers.\n   The CMTS chooses the filter\
    \ set to apply based solely on the MAC\n   address (source MAC upstream, destination\
    \ MAC downstream).  If the\n   MAC address matches that of the modem, then the\n\
    \   docsSubMgtCmFilterCmUp/Downstream pair is used; otherwise, the\n   docsSubMgtCmFilterSubUp/Downstream\
    \ pair is applied.\n   If the CM acts as a router rather than as a DOCSIS bridging\n\
    \   forwarder, then the network operator will only use the\n   docsSubMgtCmFilterCmUp/Downstream\
    \ pair.\n"

    \  It is expected that\n   any implementation of this MIB also includes at least\

  contents:
  - "3.3.1.  Using the Filter Group to Extend Packet Classification\n   The base capability\
    \ of RFC 3289 assumes that all packets on the same\n   direction of the same interface\
    \ will be classified by the same\n   criteria.  Filter Groups, which are introduced\
    \ in this document,\n   expand on RFC 3289 to allow various subscribers to receive\
    \ different\n   classification (filtering) treatment.  One way to view filter\
    \ groups\n   is as sub-interfaces within the physical DOCSIS channel.  Another\
    \ way\n   to view them is as values of a field logically prepended to the\n  \
    \ packet prior to classification:\n   [filter group][DOCSIS MAC header][IP header]...\n\
    \   Of course this 'logical' field has no existence outside of the CMTS.\n   The\
    \ diffServClfrTable and diffServClfrElementTable are then used\n   twice: the\
    \ first classifiers select among filter groups, using OIDs\n   from docsSubMgtFilterGroupTable.\
    \  The 'next' action on matching a\n   filter group is to select a diffServClfrEntry\
    \ that now classifies on\n   IP/TCP/UDP criteria (the diffServMultiFieldClfrTable).\
    \  The 'next'\n   action on this second match may be a 'count' (and accept), a\

- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   This MIB is intended to limit certain kinds of\
    \ network behavior by\n   subscriber hosts attached to cable modems, including,\
    \ for example, IP\n   spoofing.  These limitations may be compromised, however,\
    \ if the\n   cable modem's identity or registration process is spoofed.  The\n\
    \   DOCSIS RFI and privacy specifications [ITU-T-J122] and [DOCSBPI]\n   define\
    \ a number of mechanisms for assuring modem identity.\n   For network filtering\
    \ of TCP traffic to be effective, implementors\n   MUST follow the recommendations\
    \ in section 3.4.\n   There are a number of management objects defined in this\
    \ MIB that\n   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  These\n\
    \   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n   environments.\
    \  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment without proper\
    \ protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.\n   Unauthorized\
    \ SETs to this MIB can permit two major security problems\n   with public cable\
    \ network operation: IP address spoofing, and defeat\n   of operator-defined packet\
    \ filtering.\n   The following objects, if SET maliciously, would evade controls\
    \ on\n   address spoofing:\n       docsSubMgtCpeControlMaxCpeIp\n       docsSubMgtCpeControlActive\n\
    \       docsSubMgtCpeControlLearnable\n       docsSubMgtCpeControlReset\n    \
    \   docsSubMgtCpeMaxIpDefault\n       docsSubMgtCpeActiveDefault\n       docsSubMgtCpeLearnableDefault\n\
    \   The following objects could also permit packet filtering to be\n   defeated:\n\
    \       docsSubMgtCmFilterSubDownstream\n       docsSubMgtCmFilterSubUpstream\n\
    \       docsSubMgtCmFilterCmDownstream\n       docsSubMgtCmFilterCmUpstream\n\
    \   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n  \
    \ MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable\
    \ in some network environments.  It is thus important to\n   control even GET\
    \ access to these objects and possibly even to encrypt\n   the values of these\
    \ objects when they are sent over the network via\n   SNMP.  The most sensitive\
    \ is docsSubMgtCpeIpAddr within\n   docsSubMgtCpeIpTable.  Although docsSubMgtCpeIpTable\
    \ is intended to\n   control address spoofing, it includes information about the\
    \ current\n   subscriber address pool.  This information may in itself be valuable\n\
    \   to would-be spoofers.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate\
    \ security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),\n\
    \   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to\n   access\
    \ and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this\n   MIB module.\n\
    \   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as\n  \
    \ provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full\
    \ support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication and\
    \ privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n\
    \   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable\
    \ cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to\
    \ ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module\
    \ is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals\
    \ (users) who have legitimate\n   rights to GET or SET (change/create/delete)\
    \ them.\n"
