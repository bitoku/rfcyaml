  - "1.  Introduction\n   GMPLS [RFC3473] introduced explicit support for bidirectional\
    \ Label\n   Switched Paths (LSPs).  The defined support matched the switching\n\
    \   technologies covered by GMPLS, notably Time Division Multiplexing\n   (TDM)\
    \ and lambdas; specifically, it only supported bidirectional LSPs\n   with symmetric\
    \ bandwidth allocation.  Symmetric bandwidth\n   requirements are conveyed using\
    \ the semantics objects defined in\n   [RFC2205] and [RFC2210].\n   GMPLS asymmetric\
    \ bandwidth bidirectional LSPs are bidirectional LSPs\n   that have different\
    \ bandwidth reservations in each direction.\n   Support for bidirectional LSPs\
    \ with asymmetric bandwidth was\n   previously discussed in the context of Ethernet,\
    \ notably [RFC6060]\n   and [RFC6003].  In that context, asymmetric bandwidth\
    \ support was\n   considered to be a capability that was unlikely to be deployed,\
    \ and\n   hence [RFC5467] was published as Experimental.  The MPLS Transport\n\
    \   Profile, MPLS-TP, requires that asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional\n   LSPs\
    \ be supported (see [RFC5654]); therefore, this document is being\n   published\
    \ on the Standards Track.  This document has no technical\n   changes from the\
    \ approach defined in [RFC5467].  This document moves\n   the experiment documented\
    \ in [RFC5467] to the standards track and\n   obsoletes [RFC5467].  This document\
    \ also removes the Ethernet-\n   technology-specific alternative approach discussed\
    \ in the appendix of\n   [RFC5467] and maintains only one approach that is suitable\
    \ for use\n   with any technology.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Background
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Background\n   Bandwidth parameters are transported within RSVP ([RFC2210],\n\
    \   [RFC3209], and [RFC3473]) via several objects that are opaque to\n   RSVP.\
    \  While opaque to RSVP, these objects support a particular model\n   for the\
    \ communication of bandwidth information between an RSVP\n   session sender (ingress)\
    \ and receiver (egress).  The original model\n   of communication, defined in\
    \ [RFC2205] and maintained in [RFC3209],\n   used the SENDER_TSPEC and ADSPEC\
    \ objects in Path messages and the\n   FLOWSPEC object in Resv messages.  The\
    \ SENDER_TSPEC object was used\n   to indicate a sender's data generation capabilities.\
    \  The FLOWSPEC\n   object was issued by the receiver and indicated the resources\
    \ that\n   should be allocated to the associated data traffic.  The ADSPEC\n \
    \  object was used to inform the receiver and intermediate hops of the\n   actual\
    \ resources available for the associated data traffic.\n   With the introduction\
    \ of bidirectional LSPs in [RFC3473], the model\n   of communication of bandwidth\
    \ parameters was implicitly changed.  In\n   the context of [RFC3473] bidirectional\
    \ LSPs, the SENDER_TSPEC object\n   indicates the desired resources for both upstream\
    \ and downstream\n   directions.  The FLOWSPEC object is simply confirmation of\
    \ the\n   allocated resources.  The definition of the ADSPEC object is either\n\
    \   unmodified and only has meaning for downstream traffic, or is\n   implicitly\
    \ or explicitly ([RFC4606] and [RFC6003]) irrelevant.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Approach Overview
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Approach Overview\n   The approach for supporting asymmetric bandwidth\
    \ bidirectional LSPs\n   defined in this document builds on the original RSVP\
    \ model for the\n   transport of traffic-related parameters and GMPLS's support\
    \ for\n   bidirectional LSPs.\n   The defined approach is generic and can be applied\
    \ to any switching\n   technology supported by GMPLS.  With this approach, the\
    \ existing\n   SENDER_TSPEC, ADSPEC, and FLOWSPEC objects are complemented with\
    \ the\n   addition of new UPSTREAM_TSPEC, UPSTREAM_ADSPEC, and\n   UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC\
    \ objects.  The existing objects are used in the\n   original fashion defined\
    \ in [RFC2205] and [RFC2210], and refer only\n   to traffic associated with the\
    \ LSP flowing in the downstream\n   direction.  The new objects are used in exactly\
    \ the same fashion as\n   the old objects, but refer to the upstream traffic flow\
