  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element Communication\n\
    \   Protocol (PCEP).  PCEP defines the communication between a Path\n   Computation\
    \ Client (PCC) and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or\n   between PCEs, enabling\
    \ computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching\n   (MPLS) for Traffic Engineering\
    \ Label Switched Path (TE LSP)\n   characteristics.\n   [RFC8231] specifies a\
    \ set of extensions to PCEP to enable stateful\n   control of LSPs within and\
    \ across PCEP sessions in compliance with\n   [RFC4657].  It includes mechanisms\
    \ to effect Label Switched Path\n   (LSP) State Synchronization between PCCs and\
    \ PCEs, delegation of\n   control over LSPs to PCEs, and PCE control of timing\
    \ and sequence of\n   path computations within and across PCEP sessions.\n   One\
    \ of the extensions defined in [RFC8231] is the Stateful PCE\n   Request Parameters\
    \ (SRP) object.  That object includes a Flags field\n   that is a set of 32 bit\
    \ flags, and RFC 8281 defines an IANA registry\n   for tracking assigned flags.\
    \  However, RFC 8231 does not explain how\n   an implementation should set unassigned\
    \ flags in transmitted\n   messages, nor how an implementation should process\
    \ unassigned or\n   unknown flags in received messages.\n   Furthermore, [RFC8231]\
    \ gives no guidance to the authors of future\n   specifications about how to describe\
    \ the interaction between flags\n   that have already been defined and flags being\
    \ defined in the new\n   specifications.\n   This document updates RFC 8231 by\
    \ defining the correct behaviors.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Advice for Specification of New Flags
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Advice for Specification of New Flags\n   Section 7 of [RFC8231] introduces\
    \ changes to existing PCEP objects\n   and defines new PCEP objects and TLVs in\
    \ support of stateful PCE\n   functionality.  That text does not advise future\
    \ specifications on\n   how to describe the interaction between flags that may\
    \ be defined.\n   The text in Section 7 of [RFC8231] is updated to read as follows:\n\
    \      The PCEP objects defined in this document are compliant with the\n    \
    \  PCEP object format defined in [RFC5440].  The P and I flags of the\n      PCEP\
    \ objects defined in the current document MUST be set to 0 on\n      transmission\
    \ and SHOULD be ignored on receipt since they are\n      exclusively related to\
    \ path computation requests.\n      The sections that follow define PCEP objects\
    \ and TLVs that contain\n      Flags fields, and some flag values are defined.\
    \  Future\n      specifications may define further flags, and each new\n     \
    \ specification that defines additional flags is expected to\n      describe the\
    \ interaction between these new flags and any existing\n      flags.  In particular,\
    \ new specifications are expected to explain\n      how to handle the cases when\
    \ both new and pre-existing flags are\n      set.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Flags Field of the SRP Object
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Flags Field of the SRP Object\n   Section 7.2 of [RFC8231] defines the\
    \ PCEP SRP object.  It describes\n   the Flags field as:\n      Flags (32 bits):\
    \ None defined yet.\n   This document updates that text as follows:\n      Flags\
    \ (32 bits): This document does not define any flags.\n      Unassigned flags\
    \ MUST be set to zero on transmission and MUST be\n      ignored on receipt. \
    \ Implementations that do not understand any\n      particular flag MUST ignore\
    \ the flag.\n"
- title: 4.  Compatibility Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Compatibility Considerations\n   While one of the main objectives of the\
    \ changes made by this document\n   is to enable backward compatibility, there\
    \ remains an issue of\n   compatibility between existing implementations of RFC\
    \ 8231 and\n   implementations that are consistent with this document.\n   It\
    \ should be noted that common behavior for Flags fields is as\n   described by\
    \ the updated text presented in Section 3.  Thus, many\n   implementations, lacking\
    \ guidance from RFC 8231, will still have\n   implemented a consistent and future-proof\
    \ approach.  However, for\n   completeness, it is worth noting how behaviors might\
    \ interact between\n   implementations.\n   SRP objects generated by an implementation\
    \ of this document will set\n   all unknown flag bits to zero and will therefore\
    \ cause no issues to\n   an older implementation even if it inspects those bits.\
    \  Similarly,\n   an implementation of this document will not inspect any unknown\
    \ flag\n   bits and will therefore be unaffected by older implementations no\n\
    \   matter how they set the flags.\n   There will remain an issue with compatibility\
    \ between implementations\n   and how they set the flags.  An implementation of\
    \ RFC 8231 might set\n   any of the unassigned flags, but an implementation of\
    \ a future or\n   current specification (such as [RFC8281] or [RFC8741]) assigns\n\
    \   specific meanings to a flag if set.  That problem cannot be fixed in\n   old\
    \ implementations by any amount of documentation and can only be\n   handled for\
    \ future specifications by obsoleting the Flags field and\n   using a new technique.\
    \  Fortunately, however, most implementations\n   will have been constructed to\
    \ set unused flags to zero, which is\n   consistent with the behavior described\
    \ in this document, and so the\n   risk of bad interactions is sufficiently small\
    \ that there is no need\n   to obsolete the existing Flags field.\n"
- title: 5.  Management Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Management Considerations\n   Implementations receiving set SRP flags that\
    \ they do not recognize\n   MAY log this.  That could be helpful for diagnosing\
    \ backward\n   compatibility issues with future features that utilize those flags.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   [RFC8231] sets out security considerations for\
    \ PCEP when used for\n   communication with a stateful PCE.  This document does\
    \ not change\n   those considerations.\n   However, by defining the expected behavior\
    \ of implementations, this\n   document may improve the stability of networks\
    \ and thus reduce the\n   attack surface.  That is, by reminding implementations\
    \ to ignore\n   unset bits, it is less possible to attack them by randomly tweaking\n\
    \   bits.  Furthermore, by reminding implementations to leave undefined\n   bits\
    \ unset, the network is future-proofed against new definitions of\n   previously\
    \ undefined bits.\n"
- title: 7.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA maintains a registry called the \"Path Computation\
    \ Element\n   Protocol (PCEP) Numbers\" registry with a subregistry called \"\
    SRP\n   Object Flag Field\".  IANA has updated the reference for that\n   subregistry\
    \ to list this document in addition to [RFC8281].\n"
