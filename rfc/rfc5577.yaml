  - "1.  Introduction\n   ITU-T G.722.1 [ITU.G7221] is a low-complexity coder; it\
    \ compresses 50\n   Hz - 14 kHz audio signals into one of the following bit rates:\
    \ 24\n   kbit/s, 32 kbit/s, or 48 kbit/s.\n   The coder may be used for speech,\
    \ music, and other types of audio.\n   Some of the applications for which this\
    \ coder is suitable are:\n   o  Real-time communications such as videoconferencing\
    \ and telephony\n   o  Streaming audio\n   o  Archival and messaging\n   ITU-T\
    \ G.722.1 [ITU.G7221] uses 20-ms frames and a sampling rate clock\n   of 16 kHz\
    \ or 32kHz.  The encoding and decoding algorithm can change\n   the bit rate at\
    \ any 20-ms frame boundary, but no bit rate change\n   notification is provided\
    \ in-band with the bit stream.\n   For any given bit rate, the number of bits\
    \ in a frame is a constant.\n   Within this fixed frame, G.722.1 uses variable-length\
    \ coding (e.g.,\n   Huffman coding) to represent most of the encoded parameters.\
    \  All\n   variable-length codes are transmitted in order from the leftmost bit\n\
    \   (most significant bit -- MSB) to the rightmost bit (least significant\n  \
    \ bit -- LSB), see [ITU.G7221] for more details.\n   The ITU-T standardized bit\
    \ rates for G.722.1 are 24 kbit/s or\n   32kbit/s at 16 Khz sample rate, and 24\
    \ kbit/s, 32 kbit/s, or 48\n   kbit/s at 32 Khz sample rate.  However, the coding\
    \ algorithm itself\n   has the capability to run at any user-specified bit rate\
    \ (not just\n   24, 32, and 48 kbit/s) while maintaining an audio bandwidth of\
    \ 50 Hz\n   to 14 kHz.  This rate change is accomplished by a linear scaling of\n\
    \   the codec operation, resulting in frames with size in bits equal to\n   1/50\
    \ of the corresponding bit rate.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  RTP G.722.1 Header Fields\n   The RTP header is defined in the RTP specification\
    \ [RFC3550].  This\n   section defines how fields in the RTP header are used.\n\
    \      Payload Type (PT): The assignment of an RTP payload type for this\n   \
    \   packet format is outside the scope of this document; it is\n      specified\
    \ by the RTP profile under which this payload format is\n      used, or it is\
    \ signaled dynamically out-of-band (e.g., using SDP).\n      Marker (M) bit: The\
    \ M bit is set to zero.\n      Extension (X) bit: Defined by the RTP profile used.\n\
    \      Timestamp: A 32-bit word that corresponds to the sampling instant\n   \
    \   for the first frame in the RTP packet.  The sampling frequency can\n     \
    \ be 16 Khz or 32 Khz.  The RTP timestamp clock frequency of 32 Khz\n      SHOULD\
    \ be used unless only an RTP stream sampled at 16 Khz is\n      going to be sent.\n"

    \                     Figure 1: RTP payload for G.722.1.\n   Because bit rate\
    \ is not signaled in-band, a separate out-of-band\n   method is REQUIRED to indicate\
    \ the bit rate (see Section 5 for an\n   example of signaling bit rate information\
    \ using SDP).  For the\n   payload format specified here, the bit rate MUST remain\
    \ constant for\n   a particular payload type value.  An application MAY switch\
    \ bit rates\n   and clock rates from packet to packet by defining different payload\n\
    \   type values and switching between them.\n   The use of Huffman coding means\
    \ that it is not possible to identify\n   the various encoded parameters/fields\
    \ contained within the bit stream\n   without first completely decoding the entire\
    \ frame.  For the purposes\n   of packetizing the bit stream in RTP, it is only\
    \ necessary to\n   consider the sequence of bits as output by the G.722.1 encoder\
    \ and to\n   present the same sequence to the decoder.  The payload format\n \
    \  described here maintains this sequence.\n   When operating at 24 kbit/s, 480\
    \ bits (60 octets) are produced per\n   frame.  When operating at 32 kbit/s, 640\
    \ bits (80 octets) are\n   produced per frame.  When operating at 48 kbit/s, 960\
    \ bits (120\n   octets) are produced per frame.  Thus, all three bit rates allow\
    \ for\n   octet alignment without the need for padding bits.\n   Figure 2 illustrates\
    \ how the G.722.1 bit stream MUST be mapped into\n   an octet-aligned RTP payload.\n\

    \ in Figure 2.  It is RECOMMENDED that\n   values in the range 16000 to 48000\
    \ be used.  Non-standard rates MUST\n   have a value that is a multiple of 400\
    \ (this maintains octet\n   alignment and does not then require (undefined) padding\
    \ bits for each\n   frame if not octet aligned).  For example, a bit rate of 16.4\
    \ kbit/s\n   will result in a frame of size 328 bits or 41 octets, which is mapped\n\
    \   into RTP per Figure 2.\n"

    \ than one consecutive G.722.1 frame in a\n   single RTP packet.\n   Senders have\
    \ the following additional restrictions:\n   o  Sender SHOULD NOT include more\
    \ G.722.1 frames in a single RTP\n      packet than will fit in the MTU of the\

    \ have the\n      same bit rate (octets per frame).\n   o  Frames MUST NOT be\
    \ split between RTP packets.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that the number of frames contained\
    \ within an RTP\n   packet be consistent with the application.  For example, in\
    \ a\n   telephony application where delay is important, the fewer frames per\n\

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   RTP packets using the payload format defined\
    \ in this specification\n   are subject to the security considerations discussed\
    \ in the RTP\n   specification [RFC3550] and any appropriate RTP profile.  The\
    \ main\n   security considerations for the RTP packet carrying the RTP payload\n\
    \   format defined within this memo are confidentiality, integrity, and\n   source\
    \ authenticity.  Confidentiality is achieved by encryption of\n   the RTP payload.\
    \  Integrity of the RTP packets is achieved through a\n   suitable cryptographic\
    \ integrity-protection mechanism.  Such a\n   cryptographic system may also allow\
    \ the authentication of the source\n   of the payload.  A suitable security mechanism\
    \ for this RTP payload\n   format should provide confidentiality, integrity protection,\
    \ and at\n   least source authentication capable of determining if an RTP packet\n\
    \   is from a member of the RTP session.\n   Note that the appropriate mechanism\
    \ to provide security to RTP and\n   payloads following this memo may vary.  It\
    \ is dependent on the\n   application, the transport, and the signaling protocol\
    \ employed.\n   Therefore, a single mechanism is not sufficient; although, if\n\
    \   suitable, usage of the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) is\n   [RFC3711]\
    \ recommended.  Another mechanism that may be used is IPsec\n   [RFC4301] Transport\
    \ Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] (RTP over TCP);\n   other alternatives may exist.\n\
    \   This RTP payload format and its media decoder do not exhibit any\n   significant\
    \ non-uniformity in the receiver-side computational\n   complexity for packet\
    \ processing, and thus are unlikely to pose a\n   denial-of-service threat due\
    \ to the receipt of pathological data.\n   Nor does the RTP payload format contain\
