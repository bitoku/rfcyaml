Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
In particular, it defines objects for managing networks using Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) linear Automatic Protection Switching (APS) architectures.
This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) used for managing
SONET linear Automatic Protection Switching (APS) architectures.
Two linear APS architectures are supported, the 1 1 architecture and the 1:
The Internet Standard Management Framework For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
These objects are used to control and manage SONET linear APS architectures.
Ring APS groups are not currently supported by this MIB.
The MIB includes three scalars, containing counts of APS groups and SONET LTEs, a notification enable object, and six tables.
The apsMapTable contains entries for each SONET LTE interface available on the system.
The table serves two purposes.
It can be used to locate SONET LTE interfaces that are not currently included in APS groups.
It also provides a mapping from InterfaceIndex to group name and channel number for those SONET LTE interfaces that are included in APS groups.
Entries in apsMapTable cannot be added or deleted through operations defined in this MIB.
However, an apsMapEntry may be added or deleted through other system mechanisms, such as hot swap.
Also, existing entries cannot be directly modified and instead, such modifications occur as a result of side effects of operations on the apsChanConfigTable.
The apsChanConfigTable supports addition, modification and deletion of entries representing linear APS channels.
Entries are indexed by a text group name and integer channel number.
Each entry contains an InterfaceIndex value identifying the SONET LTE used for the channel and the priority of the channel.
A side effect of row creation or deletion is the setting of map entry fields.
Creation of two or more entries in this table with a common group name index and consecutive channel numbers is the first step in the creation and configuration of an APS group.
It is not necessary to create channel numbers in order; however, before an APS group is made active, the set of channels must begin with channel number 0 (for architectures other than onePlusOneOptimized) or channel number 1 (for the onePlusOneOptimized architecture) and must have consecutive channel numbers not exceeding 14.
Note that the term null channel, which is used throughout this document, refers to the protection line.
The apsConfigTable supports addition, modification, and deletion of entries representing linear APS groups.
Entries are indexed by a text group name.
Each entry contains parameters that specify the configuration of a particular linear APS group.
Entries are created in this table after a set of channels are created in the apsChanConfigTable.
To successfully set an instance of apsConfigRowStatus to active the apsConfigEntry must contain valid values and all associated apsChanConfigEntry rows must be valid and produce a consecutive set of channels beginning with channel number 0 or 1, depending on the selected architecture.
The apsCommandTable provides linear APS commands that support protection switching and the ability to modify APS operation.
Entries in this table are created as a side effect of setting the associated apsConfigRowStatus object to active.
Entries in this table are deleted if the associated apsConfigRowStatus object is set to any value except active.
The apsChanStatusTable provides individual channel statistics.
The apsStatusTable provides group level statistics.
An APS group is created and configured with the following sequence of events: CHANNEL CONFIGURATION Create an entry in the apsChanConfigTable.
Set the apsChanConfigGroupName in an apsChanConfigEntry to a user friendly text string which will serve as the APS group name.
The string must not be equal to the apsConfigName of an existing apsConfigEntry with apsConfigRowStatus set to active, since a channel cannot be added to an active group.
The string may be set equal to the apsConfigName of a row which is currently not set to active, or it may be set to a string which does not currently exist in any instance of apsConfigName.
A channel number is entered in apsChanConfigNumber.
A channel priority is entered in apsChanConfigPriority, if the intended architecture is 1:n.
apsChanConfigPriority is ignored if the architecture is 1 1.
The InterfaceIndex value of a SONET LTE interface is entered in apsChanConfigIfIndex.
This step is repeated for all apsChanConfigEntry instances which are to be included in the APS group.
If the apsChanConfigGroupName does not exist in an instance of apsConfigName,
an apsConfigEntry is created with the apsChanConfigGroupName value used as the index for the row.
The apsConfigRowStatus value may be set to createAndGo.
The apsGroupConfigEntry and apsChanConfigEntry instances with matching name fields will be checked for consistency.
If any errors in the channel numbers, architecture or configuration are uncovered the apsConfigRowStatus set will return inconsistentValue, otherwise noError is returned.
If the apsChanConfigGroupName value used in channel configuration exists in a previously created, inactive apsConfigEntry instance, the apsConfigRowStatus value may be set to active.
An agent is not required to process SNMP Set Requests that affect multiple control objects within this MIB.
This is intended to simplify the processing of Set Requests for the various control tables by eliminating the possibility that a single Set PDU will contain multiple varbinds which are in conflict, such as a PDU which both activates a given apsConfigEntry
while at the same time it deactivates an associated apsChanConfigEntry.

current DESCRIPTION "A conceptual row in the apsConfigTable.
current DESCRIPTION "A textual name for the APS group."
"The status of this APS group entry.
An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value.
Also, all associated apsChanConfigEntry rows must represent a set of consecutive channel numbers beginning with 0 or 1, depending on the selected architecture.
When set to notInService changes may be made to
apsConfigMode, apsConfigRevert, apsConfigDirection, apsConfigExtraTraffic, apsConfigSdBerThreshold, apsConfigSfBerThreshold,
Also, associated apsChanConfigTable objects may be added, deleted and modified."
"The architecture of the APS group.
The 1 1 architecture permanently bridges the working line to the protection line.
oneToN The 1:n architecture allows one protection channel to protect up to n working channels.
When a fault is detected on one of the n working channels that channel is bridged over the protection channel.
This refers to 1   1 bidirectional switching compatible with 1:n bidirectional switching as specified in ITU T Recommendation G.783 (04/97) section A.3.4.1.
Since this mode necessitates bidirectional switching, apsConfigDirection must be set to bidirectional whenever onePlusOneCompatible is set.
This refers to 1   1 bidirectional switching optimized for a network using predominantly 1   1 bidirectional switching as specified in ITU T Recommendation G.783 (04/97) section B.1.
Since this mode necessitates bidirectional switching, apsConfigDirection must be set to bidirectional whenever onePlusOneOptimized is set.
This object may not be modified if the associated apsConfigRowStatus object is equal to active(1).
"The revertive mode of the APS group.
nonrevertive Traffic remains on the protection line until another switch request is received.
When the condition that caused a switch to the protection line has been cleared the signal is switched back to the working line.
Since switching is revertive with the 1:
n architecture, apsConfigRevert must be set to revertive if apsConfigMode is set to oneToN.
Switching may optionally be revertive with the 1 1 architecture.
This object may not be modified if the associated apsConfigRowStatus object is equal to active(1).
"The directional mode of the APS group.
The unidirectional mode provides protection in one direction.
The bidirectional mode provides protection in both directions.
This object may not be modified if the associated apsConfigRowStatus object is equal to active(1).
"This object enables or disables the transfer of extra traffic on the protection channel in a 1:n architecture.
This object must be set to disabled if the architecture is 1 1.
It may be necessary to disable this in order to interwork with other SONET network elements that don't support extra traffic.
This object may not be modified if the associated apsConfigRowStatus object is equal to active(1).
The negated value of this number is used as the exponent of 10 for computing the threshold value for the Bit Error Rate (BER).
For example, a value of 5 indicates a BER threshold of 10^ 5.
This object may be modified if the associated apsConfigRowStatus object is equal to active(1).
"The Signal Failure Bit Error Rate.
The negated value of this number is used as the exponent of 10 for computing the threshold value for the Bit Error Rate (BER).
For example, a value of 5 indicates a BER threshold of 10^ 5.
This object may be modified if the associated apsConfigRowStatus object is equal to active(1).
"The Wait To Restore period in seconds.
After clearing of a condition that necessitated an automatic switch, the wait to restore period must elapse before reverting.
This is intended to avoid rapid switch oscillations.
GR 253 CORE specifies a Wait To Restore range of 5 to 12 minutes.
G.783 defines a 5 to 12 minute
To Restore range in section 5.4.1.1.3, but also allows for a shorter WTR period in  Table 2 1,

modeMismatch Modes other than 1 1 unidirectional monitor protection line K2 bit 5, which indicates the architecture and K2 bits 6 8, which indicate if the mode is unidirectional or bidirectional.
A conflict between the current local mode and the received K2 mode information constitutes a mode mismatch.
This bit indicates a  mismatch between the transmitted K1 channel and the received K2 channel has been detected.
psbf This bit indicates a Protection Switch Byte Failure (PSBF) is in effect.
This condition occurs when either an inconsistent APS byte or an invalid code is detected.
An inconsistent APS byte occurs when no three consecutive K1 bytes of the last 12 successive frames are identical, starting with the last frame containing a previously consistent byte.
An invalid code occurs when the incoming K1 byte contains an unused code or a code irrelevant for the specific switching operation (e.g., Reverse Request while no switching request is outstanding) in three consecutive frames.
An invalid code also occurs when the incoming K1 byte contains an invalid channel number in three consecutive frames.
feplf Modes other than 1 1 unidirectional monitor the K1 byte for Far End Protection Line failures.
A Far End Protection Line defect is declared based on receiving SF on the protection line.

apsConfigDirection, apsConfigExtraTraffic, apsConfigSdBerThreshold, apsConfigSfBerThreshold, apsConfigCreationTime, apsConfigRowStatus, apsConfigStorageType, apsNotificationEnable } STATUS  current DESCRIPTION
{ apsConfigWaitToRestore } STATUS  current DESCRIPTION "The apsConfigTable object that provides information which is applicable to groups supporting a configurable WTR period."
If set operations are not supported neither of the following two    groups are implemented.
If sets are supported only one of these    groups is implemented for a linear APS group instance.
OBJECT GROUP OBJECTS { apsCommandSwitch } STATUS  current DESCRIPTION "The  apsCommandTable object which is applicable to groups implementing the linear APS 1 1 architecture.
Also, set operations must be supported."
OBJECT GROUP OBJECTS { apsCommandSwitch, apsCommandControl } STATUS  current DESCRIPTION
"A collection of apsCommandTable objects which are applicable to groups implementing the linear APS 1:n architecture.
Also, set operations must be supported."
A collection of apsStatusTable objects providing status information applicable to all linear APS groups."
A collection of channel objects providing information applicable to all linear APS channels."
OBJECT GROUP OBJECTS { apsChanConfigPriority } STATUS  current DESCRIPTION
"The apsChanConfigTable object that provides information which is only applicable to groups implementing the linear APS 1:n architecture."
A collection of apsMapTable objects providing a mapping from sonet(39) InterfaceIndex to group name and channel number for assigned APS channels and a list of unassigned sonet(39) interfaces."
A collection of SONET linear APS notifications."
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
In particular, the APS command objects
and apsCommandControl and the APS configuration objects apsConfigRowStatus,
apsConfigMode, apsConfigRevert, apsConfigDirection, apsConfigExtraTraffic, apsConfigSdBerThreshold, apsConfigSfBerThreshold, apsConfigWaitToRestore, apsConfigStorageType, apsChanConfigRowStatus, apsChanConfigIfIndex, apsChanConfigPriority,
apsChanConfigStorageType and apsNotificationEnable have the potential of disrupting APS operations if set operations are performed with malicious intent.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is recommended that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is not recommended.
Instead, it is recommended to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured for only those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to GET or SET object instances.
