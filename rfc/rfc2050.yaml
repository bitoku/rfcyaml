  - "1. Introduction\n   The addressing constraints described in this document are\
    \ largely the\n   result of the interaction of existing router technology, address\n\
    \   assignment, and architectural history.  After extensive review and\n   discussion,\
    \ the authors of this document, the IETF working group that\n   reviewed it and\
    \ the IESG have concluded that there are no other\n   currently deployable technologies\
    \ available to overcome these\n   limitations. In the event that routing or router\
    \ technology develops\n   to the point that adequate routing aggregation can be\
    \ achieved by\n   other means or that routers can deal with larger routing and\
    \ more\n   dynamic tables, it may be appropriate to review these constraints.\n\
    \   Internet address space is distributed according to the following\n   three\
    \ goals:\n   1) Conservation: Fair distribution of globally unique Internet address\n\
    \   space according to the operational needs of the end-users and Internet\n \
    \  Service Providers operating networks using this address space.\n   Prevention\
    \ of stockpiling in order to maximize the lifetime of the\n   Internet address\
    \ space.\n   2) Routability: Distribution of globally unique Internet addresses\n\
    \   in a hierarchical manner, permitting the routing scalability of\n   the addresses.\
    \ This scalability is necessary to ensure proper\n   operation of Internet routing,\
    \ although it must be stressed that\n   routability is in no way guaranteed with\
    \ the allocation or\n   assignment of IPv4 addresses.\n   3) Registration: Provision\
    \ of a public registry documenting address\n   space allocation and assignment.\
    \  This is necessary to ensure\n   uniqueness and to provide information for Internet\
    \ trouble shooting\n   at all levels.\n   It is in the interest of the Internet\
    \ community as a whole that the\n   above goals be pursued.  However it should\
    \ be noted that\n   \"Conservation\" and \"Routability\" are often conflicting\
    \ goals.  All\n   the above goals may sometimes be in conflict with the interests\
    \ of\n   individual end-users or Internet service providers.  Careful analysis\n\
    \   and judgement is necessary in each individual case to find an\n   appropriate\
    \ compromise.\n   The Internet Registry system\n      In order to achieve the\
    \ above goals the Internet Registry (IR)\n      hierarchy was established.\n \
    \     The Internet Registry hierarchy consists of the following levels\n     \
    \ of hierarchy as seen from the top down: IANA, Regional IRs, Local\n      IRs.\n\
    \   IANA\n      The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority has authority over all\n\
    \      number spaces used in the Internet.  This includes Internet\n      Address\
    \ Space. IANA allocates parts of the Internet address space\n      to regional\
    \ IRs according to its established needs.\n   Regional IRs\n      Regional IRs\
    \ operate in large geopolitical regions such as\n      continents.  Currently\
    \ there are three regional IRs established;\n      InterNIC serving North America,\
    \ RIPE NCC serving Europe, and AP-\n      NIC serving the Asian Pacific region.\
    \  Since this does not cover\n      all areas, regional IRs also serve areas around\
    \ its core service\n      areas.  It is expected that the number of regional IRs\
    \ will remain\n      relatively small.  Service areas will be of continental\n\
    \      dimensions.\n      Regional IRs are established under the authority of\
    \ the IANA.\n      This requires consensus within the Internet community of the\n\
    \      region.  A consensus of Internet Service Providers in that region\n   \
    \   may be necessary to fulfill that role.\n      The specific duties of the regional\
    \ IRs include coordination and\n      representation of all local IRs in its respective\
    \ regions.\n   Local IRs\n      Local IRs are established under the authority\
    \ of the regional IR\n      and IANA.  These local registries have the same role\
    \ and\n      responsibility as the regional registries within its designated\n\
    \      geographical areas.  These areas are usually of national\n      dimensions.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1  Guidelines for Internet Service Providers (ISPs)\n   This document makes\
    \ a distinction between the allocation of IP\n   addresses and the assignment\
    \ of IP addresses.  Addresses are\n   allocated to ISPs by regional registries\
    \ to assign to its customer\n   base.\n   ISPs who exchange routing information\
    \ with other ISPs at multiple\n   locations and operate without default routing\
    \ may request space\n   directly from the regional registry in its geographical\
    \ area.  ISPs\n   with no designated regional registry may contact any regional\n\
    \   registry and the regional registry may either handle the request or\n   refer\
    \ the request to an appropriate registry.\n   To facilitate hierarchical addressing,\
    \ implemented using Classless\n   Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), all other ISPs\
    \ should request address\n   space directly from its upstream provider.  ISPs\
    \ only request address\n   space directly from regional registries if their immediate\n\
    \   requirement, when satisfied with a contiguous block allocation, has a\n  \
    \ reasonable probability of being routable on the Internet, and they\n   meet\
    \ one or more of the following conditions.\n       a)  the ISP is directly connected\
    \ to a major routing exchange\n           (for purposes of this document, a major\
    \ routing exchange\n            is defined as a neutral layer 2 exchange point\
    \ connecting\n            four or more unrelated ISPs.)\n       b)  the ISP is\
    \ multi-homed, that is, it has more than one\n           simultaneous connection\
    \ to the global Internet and no\n           connection is favored over the other\n\
    \   Note that addresses issued directly from the IRs (non-provider\n   based),\
    \ are the least likely to be routable across the Internet.\n   The following are\
    \ the IP allocation guidelines for ISPs:\n   1.  CIDR addresses are allocated\
    \ to ISPs in blocks.  It is\n       recommended that those blocks remain intact.\
    \  Fragmentation of\n       CIDR blocks is discouraged.  More specifically, ISPs\
    \ are\n       encouraged to treat address assignments as loans for the\n     \
    \  duration of the connectivity provision.  At the termination\n       of the\
    \ Internet connectivity contract, e.g., the customer\n       moves to another\
    \ service provider, it is recommended the\n       customer return the network\
    \ addresses currently in use and\n       renumber into the new provider's address\
    \ space.  The ISP\n       should allow sufficient time for the renumbering process\
    \ to be\n       completed before the IP addresses are reused.\n   2.  To ensure\
    \ efficient implementation and use of Classless\n       Inter-Domain Routing (IDR),\
    \ the Regional Registries issue\n       address space on appropriate \"CIDR-supported\"\
    \ bit boundaries.\n   3.  ISPs are required to utilize address space in an efficient\n\
    \       manner.  To this end, ISPs should have documented\n       justification\
    \ available for each assignment.  The regional\n       registry may, at any time,\
    \ ask for this information.  If the\n       information is not available, future\
    \ allocations may be impacted.\n       In extreme cases, existing loans may be\
    \ impacted.\n   4.  IP addresses are allocated to ISPs using a slow-start\n  \
    \     procedure.  New ISPs will receive a minimal amount based\n       on immediate\
    \ requirement.  Thereafter,  allocated blocks may be\n       increased based on\
    \ utilization verification supplied to the\n       regional registry.  The parent\
    \ registries are responsible for\n       determining appropriate initial and subsequent\
    \ allocations.\n       Additional address allocations will provide enough address\
    \ space\n       to enable the ISP to assign addresses for three months\n     \
    \  without requesting additional address space from its parent\n       registry.\
    \  Please note that projected customer base has little\n       impact on the address\
    \ allocations made by the parent registries.\n       Initial allocation will not\
    \ be based on any current or future\n       routing restrictions but on demonstrated\
    \ requirements.\n   5.  Due to the requirement to increase the utilization efficiency\n\
    \       of IPv4 address space, all assignments are made with the\n       assumption\
    \ that sites make use of variable length subnet mask\n       (VLSM) and classless\
    \ technologies within their network.  Any\n       request for address space based\
    \ on the use of classfull\n       assumptions will require a detailed justification.\
    \  The use of\n       classfull technologies for the purposes of administrative\n\
    \       convenience is generally insupportable due to the limited\n       availability\
    \ of free IPv4 address space.\n   6.  Regional registries may set a maximum limit\
    \ on assignment sizes\n       such that a second opinion of the regional registry\
    \ is required.\n   7.  Due to constraints on the available free pool of IPv4 address\n\
    \       space, the use of static IP address assignments (e.g., one\n       address\
    \ per customer) for dial-up users is strongly discouraged.\n       While it is\
    \ understood that the use of static addressing may\n       ease some aspects of\
    \ administration, the current rate of\n       consumption of the remaining unassigned\
    \ IPv4 address space does\n       not permit the assignment of addresses for administrative\
    \ ease.\n       Organizations considering the use of static IP address assignment\n\
    \       are expected to investigate and implement dynamic assignment\n       technologies\
    \ whenever possible.\n"
- title: 2.2  Submission of Reassignment Information
  contents:
  - "2.2  Submission of Reassignment Information\n   It is imperative that reassignment\
    \ information be submitted in a\n   prompt and efficient manner to facilitate\
    \ database maintenance and\n   ensure database integrity.  Therefore, assignment\
    \ information must be\n   submitted to the regional registry immediately upon\
    \ making the\n   assignment.  The following reasons necessitate transmission of\
    \ the\n   reassignment information:\n       a)  to provide operational staff with\
    \ information on who is using\n           the network number and to provide a\
    \ contact in case of\n           operational/security problems,\n       b)  to\
    \ ensure that a provider has exhausted a majority of its\n           current CIDR\
    \ allocation, thereby justifying an additional\n           allocation,\n     \
    \  c)  to assist in IP allocation studies.\n   Procedures for submitting the reassignment\
    \ information will be\n   determined by each regional registry based on its unique\n\
    \   requirements.\n   All sub-registries (ISPs, Local registries, etc.) must register\
    \ with\n   their respective regional registry to receive information regarding\n\
    \   reassignment guidelines.  No additional CIDR blocks will be allocated\n  \
    \ by the regional registry or upstream providers until approximately\n   80% of\
    \ all reassignment information has been submitted.\n"
- title: 3. Assignment Framework
  contents:
  - "3. Assignment Framework\n   An assignment is the delegation of authority over\
    \ a block of IP\n   addresses to an end enterprise.   The end enterprise will\
    \ use\n   addresses from an assignment internally only; it will not sub-\n   delegate\
    \ those addresses.  This section discusses some of the issues\n   involved in\
    \ assignments and the framework behind the assignment of\n   addresses.\n   In\
    \ order for the Internet to scale using existing technologies, use\n   of regional\
    \ registry services should be limited to the assignment of\n   IP addresses for\
    \ organizations meeting one or more of the following\n   conditions:\n      a)\
    \  the organization has no intention of connecting to\n          the Internet-either\
    \ now or in the future-but it still\n          requires a globally unique IP address.\
    \  The organization\n          should consider using reserved addresses from RFC1918.\n\
    \          If it is determined this is not possible, they can be\n          issued\
    \ unique (if not Internet routable) IP addresses.\n      b)  the organization\
    \ is multi-homed with no favored connection.\n      c)  the organization's actual\
    \ requirement for IP space is\n          very large, for example, the network\
    \ prefix required to\n          cover the request is of length /18 or shorter.\n\
    \   All other requestors should contact its ISP for address space or\n   utilize\
    \ the addresses reserved for non-connected networks described\n   in RFC1918 until\
    \ an Internet connection is established.  Note that\n   addresses issued directly\
    \ from the IRs,(non-provider based), are the\n   least likely to be routable across\
    \ the Internet.\n"
- title: 3.1  Common Registry Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.1  Common Registry Requirements\n   Because the number of available IP addresses\
    \ on the Internet is\n   limited, the utilization rate of address space will be\
    \ a key factor\n   in network number assignment.  Therefore, in the best interest\
    \ of the\n   Internet as a whole, specific guidelines have been created to govern\n\
    \   the assignment of addresses based on utilization rates.\n   Although topological\
    \ issues may make exceptions necessary, the basic\n   criteria that should be\
    \ met to receive network numbers are listed\n   below:\n                25% immediate\
    \ utilization rate\n                50% utilization  rate within 1 year\n   The\
    \ utilization rate above is to be used as a guideline, there may be\n   be occasions\
    \ when the 1 year rate does not fall exactly in this\n   range.  Organizations\
    \ must exhibit a high confidence level in its 1\n   year utilization rate and\
    \ supply documentation to justify the level\n   of confidence.\n   Organizations\
    \ will be assigned address space based on immediate\n   utilization plus 1 year\
    \ projected utilization.  A prefix longer than\n   /24 may be issued if deemed\
    \ appropriate.  Organizations with less\n   than 128 hosts will not be issued\
    \ an IP address directly from the\n   IRs.  Organizations may be issued a prefix\
    \ longer than /24 if the\n   organization can provide documentation from a registry\
    \ recognized ISP\n   indicating the ISP will accept the long prefix for injection\
    \ into the\n   global routing system.\n   Exceptions to the criteria will not\
    \ be made based on insufficient\n   equipment without additional detailed justification.\
    \  Organizations\n   should implement variable length subnet mask (VLSM) internally\
    \ to\n   maximize the effective utilization of address space.  Address\n   assignments\
    \ will be made under the assumption that VLSM is or will be\n   implemented.\n\
    \   IP addresses are valid as long as the criteria continues to be met.\n   The\
    \ IANA reserves the right to invalidate any IP assignments once it\n   is determined\
    \ the the requirement for the address space no longer\n   exists.  In the event\
    \ of address invalidation, reasonable efforts\n   will be made by the appropriate\
    \ registry to inform the organization\n   that the addresses have been returned\
    \ to the free pool of IPv4\n   address space.\n"
- title: 3.2  Network Engineering Plans

  - "3.2  Network Engineering Plans\n   Before a registry makes an assignment, it\
    \ must examine each address\n   space request in terms of the requesting organization's\
    \ networking\n   plans.  These plans should be documented, and the following\n\
    \   information should be included:\n      1.  subnetting plans, including subnet\
    \ masks and number of\n          hosts on each subnet for at least one year\n\
    \      2.  a description of the network topology\n      3.  a description of the\

    \ remark regarding the subnet.\n   If subnetting is not being used, an explanation\
    \ why it cannot be\n   implemented is required.  Care must be taken to ensure\

- title: 3.3  Previous Assignment History
  contents:
  - "3.3  Previous Assignment History\n   To promote increased usage of address space,\
    \ the registries will\n   require an accounting of address space previously assigned\
    \ to the\n   enterprise, if any.  In the context of address space allocation,\
    \ an\n   \"enterprise\" consists of all divisions and/or subsidiaries falling\n\
    \   under a common parent organization.  The previous assignment history\n   should\
    \ include all network numbers assigned to the organization, plus\n   the network\
    \ masks for those networks and the number of hosts on each\n   (sub-)network.\
    \  Sufficient corroborating evidence should be provided\n   to allow the assigning\
    \ registry to be confident that the network\n   descriptions provided are accurate.\

- title: 4.  Operational Guidelines For Registries
  contents:
  - "4.  Operational Guidelines For Registries\n   1.  Regional Registries provide\
    \ registration services as its\n       primary function.  Therefore, regional\
    \ registries may charge some\n       fee for services rendered, generally in relation\
    \ to the cost of\n       providing those services.\n   2.  Regardless of the source\
    \ of its address space, sub-registries\n       (Local IRs, ISPs, etc.) must adhere\
    \ to the guidelines of its\n       regional registry.  In turn, it must also ensure\
    \ that its\n       customers follow those guidelines.\n   3.  To maximize the\
    \ effective use of address space, IP addresses need\n       to be assigned/allocated\
    \ in classless blocks.  With this in mind,\n       assignments will not be made\
    \ in Class Cs or Bs but by prefix\n       length.  Consequently, an organization\
    \ that would have been\n       assigned a Class B in the past will now be assigned\
    \ a /16 prefix,\n       regardless of the actual address class.\n   4.  All IP\
    \ address requests are subject to audit and verification\n       by any means\
    \ deemed appropriate by the regional registry.\n       If any assignment is found\
    \ to be based on false information,\n       the registry may invalidate the request\
    \ and return the\n       assigned addresses back to the pool of free addresses\
    \ for\n       later assignment.\n   5.  Due to technical and implementation constraints\
    \ on the Internet\n       routing system and the possibility of routing overload,\
    \ major\n       transit providers may need to impose certain restrictions to\n\
    \       reduce the number of globally advertised routes.  This may\n       include\
    \ setting limits on the size of CIDR prefixes added to\n       the routing tables,\
    \ filtering of non-aggregated routes, etc.\n       Therefore, addresses obtained\
    \ directly from regional registry\n       (provider-independent, also known as\

    \ provided to request address space is often considered\n       sensitive by the\

    \  be required to do the assignment.  In such cases, the parent\n       registry\
    \ will provide the assigning registry with information\n       regarding the appropriate\
    \ amount of address space to allocate.\n   7.  The transfer of IP addresses from\

    \ if they were\n       requesting an IP address directly from the IR.\n"

    \ its address\n   has not performed its task in the requisite manner, the organization\n\
    \   has the right of appeal to the parent registry.\n   In such cases, the assigning\
    \ registry shall make available all\n   relevant documentation to the parent registry,\
    \ and the decision of\n   the parent registry shall be considered final (barring\
    \ additional\n   appeals to the parent registry's parent).  If necessary, after\n\
    \   exhausting all other avenues, the appeal may be forwarded to IANA for\n  \
    \ a final decision.  Each registry must, as part of their policy,\n   document\
    \ and specify how to appeal a registry assignment decision.\n"
