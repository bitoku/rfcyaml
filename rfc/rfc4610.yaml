  - "Abstract\n   This specification allows Anycast-RP (Rendezvous Point) to be used\n\
    \   inside a domain that runs Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) only.\n   Other\
    \ multicast protocols (such as Multicast Source Discovery\n   Protocol (MSDP),\
    \ which has been used traditionally to solve this\n   problem) are not required\
    \ to support Anycast-RP.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Anycast-RP as described in [I1] is a mechanism that ISP-based\n\
    \   backbones have used to get fast convergence when a PIM Rendezvous\n   Point\
    \ (RP) router fails.  To allow receivers and sources to\n   Rendezvous to the\
    \ closest RP, the packets from a source need to get\n   to all RPs to find joined\
    \ receivers.\n   This notion of receivers finding sources is the fundamental problem\n\
    \   of source discovery that MSDP was intended to solve.  However, if one\n  \
    \ would like to retain the Anycast-RP benefits from [I1] with less\n   protocol\
    \ machinery, removing MSDP from the solution space is an\n   option.\n   This\
    \ memo extends the Register mechanism in PIM so Anycast-RP\n   functionality can\
    \ be retained without using MSDP.\n"

    \ This\n     address is statically configured, or distributed using a dynamic\n\
    \     protocol, to all PIM routers throughout the domain.\n   o A set of routers\
    \ in the domain is chosen to act as RPs for this RP\n     address.  These routers\
    \ are called the Anycast-RP set.\n   o Each router in the Anycast-RP set is configured\
    \ with a loopback\n     interface using the RP address.\n   o Each router in the\
    \ Anycast-RP set also needs a separate IP address,\n     to be used for communication\
    \ between the RPs.\n   o The RP address, or a prefix that covers the RP address,\
    \ is injected\n     into the unicast routing system inside of the domain.\n  \
    \ o Each router in the Anycast-RP set is configured with the addresses\n     of\
    \ all other routers in the Anycast-RP set.  This must be\n     consistently configured\

  contents:
  - "3.  Mechanism\n   The following diagram illustrates a domain using 3 RPs where\n\
    \   receivers are joining to the closest RP according to where unicast\n   routing\
    \ metrics take them and 2 sources sending packets to their\n   respective RPs.\n\
    \   The rules described in this section do not override the rules in\n   [N1].\
    \  They are intended to blend with the rules in [N1].  If there\n   is any question\
    \ on the interpretation, precedent is given to [N1].\n         S1-----RP1    \
    \          RP2                RP3------S3\n                / \\              \
    \ |\n               /   \\              |\n              R1   R1'            R2\n\
    \   Assume the above scenario is completely connected where R1, R1', and\n   R2\
    \ are receivers for a group, and S1 and S3 send to that group.\n   Assume RP1,\
    \ RP2, and RP3 are all assigned the same IP address, which\n   is used as the\
    \ Anycast-RP address (let's say the IP address is RPA).\n   Note, the address\
    \ used for the RP address in the domain (the\n   Anycast-RP address) needs to\
    \ be different than the addresses used by\n   the Anycast-RP routers to communicate\
    \ with each other.\n   The following procedure is used when S1 starts sourcing\
    \ traffic:\n   o S1 sends a multicast packet.\n   o The designated router (DR)\
    \ directly attached to S1 will form a PIM\n     Register message to send to the\
    \ Anycast-RP address (RPA).  The\n     unicast routing system will deliver the\
    \ PIM Register message to the\n     nearest RP, in this case RP1.\n   o RP1 will\
    \ receive the PIM Register message, decapsulate it, and send\n     the packet\
    \ down the shared-tree to get the packet to receivers R1\n     and R1'.\n   o\
    \ RP1 is configured with RP2 and RP3's IP address.  Since the\n     Register message\
    \ did not come from one of the RPs in the anycast-RP\n     set, RP1 assumes the\
    \ packet came from a DR.  If the Register is not\n     addressed to the Anycast-RP\
    \ address, an error has occurred and it\n     should be rate-limited logged.\n\
    \   o RP1 will then send a copy of the Register message from S1's DR to\n    \
    \ both RP2 and RP3.  RP1 will use its own IP address as the source\n     address\
    \ for the PIM Register message.\n   o RP1 MAY join back to the source-tree by\
    \ triggering a (S1,G) Join\n     message toward S1.  However, RP1 MUST create\
    \ (S1,G) state.\n   o RP1 sends a Register-Stop back to the DR.  If, for some\
    \ reason, the\n     Register messages to RP2 and RP3 are lost, then when the Register\n\
    \     suppression timer expires in the DR, it will resend Registers to\n     allow\
    \ another chance for all RPs in the Anycast-RP set to obtain\n     the (S,G) state.\n\
    \   o RP2 receives the Register message from RP1, decapsulates it, and\n     also\
    \ sends the packet down the shared-tree to get the packet to\n     receiver R2.\n\
    \   o RP2 sends a Register-Stop back to RP1.  RP2 MAY wait to send the\n     Register-Stop\
    \ if it decides to join the source-tree.  RP2 should\n     wait until it has received\
    \ data from the source on the source-tree\n     before sending the Register-Stop.\
    \  If RP2 decides to wait, the\n     Register-Stop will be sent when the next\
    \ Register is received.  If\n     RP2 decides not to wait, the Register-Stop is\
    \ sent now.\n   o RP2 MAY join back to the source-tree by triggering a (S1,G)\
    \ Join\n     message toward S1.  However, RP2 MUST create (S1,G) state.\n   o\
    \ RP3 receives the Register message from RP1, decapsulates it, but\n     since\
    \ there are no receivers joined for the group, it can discard\n     the packet.\n\
    \   o RP3 sends a Register-Stop back to RP1.\n   o RP3 creates (S1,G) state so\
    \ when a receiver joins after S1 starts\n     sending, RP3 can join quickly to\
    \ the source-tree for S1.\n   o RP1 processes the Register-Stop from each of RP2\
    \ and RP3.  There is\n     no specific action taken when processing Register-Stop\
    \ messages.\n   The procedure for S3 sending follows the same as above but it\
    \ is RP3\n   that sends a copy of the Register originated by S3's DR to RP1 and\n\
    \   RP2.  Therefore, this example shows how sources anywhere in the\n   domain,\
    \ associated with different RPs, can reach all receivers, also\n   associated\
    \ with different RPs, in the same domain.\n"
- title: 4.  Observations and Guidelines about This Proposal
  contents:
  - "4.  Observations and Guidelines about This Proposal\n   o An RP will send a copy\
    \ of a Register only if the Register is\n     received from an IP address not\
    \ in the Anycast-RP list (i.e., the\n     Register came from a DR and not another\
    \ RP).  An implementation\n     MUST safeguard against inconsistently configured\
    \ Anycast-RP sets in\n     each RP by copying the Time to Live (TTL) from a Register\
    \ message\n     to the Register messages it copies and sends to other RPs.\n \
    \  o Each DR that PIM registers for a source will send the message to\n     the\
    \ Anycast-RP address (which results in the packet getting to the\n     closest\
    \ physical RP).  Therefore, there are no changes to the DR\n     logic.\n   o\
    \ Packets flow to all receivers no matter what RP they have joined\n     to.\n\
    \   o The source gets Registered to a single RP by the DR.  It's the\n     responsibility\
    \ of the RP that receives the PIM Register messages\n     from the DR (the closest\
    \ RP to the DR based on routing metrics) to\n     get the packet to all other\
    \ RPs in the Anycast-RP set.\n   o Logic is changed only in the RPs.  The logic\
    \ change is for sending\n     copies of Register messages.  Register-Stop processing\
    \ is\n     unchanged.  However, an implementation MAY suppress sending\n     Register-Stop\
    \ messages in response to a Register received from an\n     RP.\n   o The rate-limiting\
    \ of Register and Register-Stop messages are done\n     end-to-end.  That is from\
    \ DR -> RP1 -> {RP2 and RP3}.  There is no\n     need for specific rate-limiting\
    \ logic between the RPs.\n   o When topology changes occur, the existing source-tree\
    \ adjusts as it\n     does today according to [N1].  The existing shared-trees,\
    \ as well,\n     adjust as they do today according to [N1].\n   o Physical RP\
    \ changes are as fast as unicast route convergence,\n     retaining the benefit\
    \ of [I1].\n   o An RP that doesn't support this specification can be mixed with\
    \ RPs\n     that do support this specification.  However, the non-supporter RP\n\
    \     should not have sources registering to it, but may have receivers\n    \
    \ joined to it.\n   o If Null Registers are sent (Registers with an IP header\
    \ and no IP\n     payload), they MUST be replicated to all of the RPs in the\n\
    \     Anycast-RP set so that source state remains alive for active\n     sources.\n\
    \   o The number of RPs in the Anycast-RP set should remain small so the\n   \
    \  amount of non-native replication is kept to a minimum.\n   o Since the RP,\
    \ who receives a Register from the DR, will send copies\n     of the Register\
    \ to the other RPs at the same time it sends a\n     Register-Stop to the DR,\
    \ there could be packet loss and lost state\n     in the other RPs until the time\
    \ the DR sends Register messages\n     again.\n"

  - "5.  Interaction with MSDP Running in an Anycast-PIM Router\n   The objective\
    \ of this Anycast-PIM proposal is to remove the\n   dependence on using MSDP.\
    \  This can be achieved by removing MSDP\n   peering between the Anycast-RPs.\
    \  However, to advertise internal\n   sources to routers outside of a PIM routing\
    \ domain and to learn\n   external sources from other routing domains, MSDP may\
    \ still be\n   required.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Anycast-PIM Stub Domain Functionality
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Anycast-PIM Stub Domain Functionality\n   In this capacity, when there\
    \ are internal sources that need to be\n   advertised externally, an Anycast-RP\
    \ that receives a Register\n   message, either from a DR or an Anycast-RP, should\
    \ process it as\n   described in this specification as well as how to process\
    \ a Register\n   message as described in [N1].  That means a Source-Active (SA)\
    \ for\n   the same internal source could be originated by multiple Anycast-RPs\n\
    \   doing the MSDP peering.  There is nothing inherently wrong with this\n   other\
    \ than that the source is being advertised into the MSDP\n   infrastructure from\
    \ multiple places from the source domain.  However,\n   if this is not desirable,\
    \ configuration of one or more (rather than\n   all) Anycast-RP MSDP routers would\
    \ allow only those routers to\n   originate SAs for the internal source.  And\
    \ in some situations, there\n   is a good possibility not all Anycast-RPs in the\
    \ set will have MSDP\n   peering sessions so this issue can be mitigated to a\
    \ certain extent.\n   From an Anycast-RP perspective, a source should be considered\n\
    \   internal to a domain when it is discovered by an Anycast-RP through a\n  \
    \ received Register message, regardless of whether the Register message\n   was\
    \ sent by a DR, another Anycast-RP member, or the router itself.\n   For learning\
    \ sources external to a domain, the MSDP SA messages could\n   arrive at multiple\
    \ MSDP-peering Anycast-RPs.  The rules for\n   processing an SA, according to\
    \ [I1], should be followed.  That is, if\n   G is joined in the domain, an (S,G)\
    \ join is sent towards the source.\n   And if data accompanies the SA, each Anycast-PIM\
    \ RP doing MSDP\n   peering will forward the data down each of its respective\
    \ shared-\n   trees.\n   The above assumes each Anycast-RP has external MSDP peering\n\
    \   connections.  If this is not the case, the Anycast-PIM routers with\n   the\
    \ MSDP peering connections would follow the same procedure as if a\n   Data-Register\
    \ or Null-Register was received from either a DR or\n   another Anycast-RP.  That\
    \ is, they would send Registers to the other\n   members of the Anycast-RP set.\n\
    \   If there is a mix of Anycast-RPs that do and do not have external\n   MSDP\
    \ peering connections, then the ones that do must be configured\n   with the set\
    \ that do not.  So Register messages are sent only to the\n   members of the Anycast-RP\
    \ set that do not have external MSDP peering\n   connections.\n   The amount of\
    \ Register traffic generated by this MSDP-peering RP\n   would be equal to the\
    \ number of active sources external to the\n   domain.  The Source-Active state\
    \ would have to be conveyed to all\n   other RPs in the Anycast-RP set since the\
    \ MSDP-peering RP would not\n   know about the group membership associated with\
    \ the other RPs.  To\n   avoid this periodic control traffic, it is recommended\
    \ that all\n   Anycast-RPs be configured with external MSDP peering sessions so\
    \ no\n   RP in the Anycast-RP set will have to originate Register messages on\n\
    \   behalf of external sources.\n"
