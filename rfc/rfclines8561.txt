Abstract This document defines a YANG data model for control and management of radio link interfaces and their connectivity to packet (typically Ethernet) interfaces in a microwave/millimeter wave node.
The data nodes for management of the interface protection functionality is broken out into a separate and generic YANG data model in order to make it available for other interface types as well.
This document defines a YANG data model for management and control of the radio link interface(s) and the relationship to packet (typically Ethernet)
and/or Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) interfaces in a microwave/millimeter wave node.
The ETSI EN 302 217 series defines the characteristics and requirements of microwave/millimeter wave equipment and antennas.
Specifically, ETSI EN 302 217 2
[EN302217 2] specifies the essential parameters for systems operating from 1.4 GHz to 86 GHz.
The data model includes configuration and state data according to the new Network Management Datastore Architecture [RFC8342].
The design of the data model follows the framework for management and control of microwave and millimeter wave interface parameters defined in [RFC8432].
This framework identifies the need and the scope of the YANG data model, use cases, and requirements that the model needs to support.
Moreover, it provides a detailed gap analysis to identify the missing parameters and functionalities of the existing and established models to support the specified use cases and requirements, and based on that, it recommends how the gaps should be filled with the development of the new model.
According to the conclusion of the gap analysis, the structure of the data model is based on the structure defined in [MICROWAVE RADIO LINK], and it augments [RFC8343] to align with the same structure for management of the packet interfaces.
More specifically, the model will include interface layering to manage the capacity provided by a radio link terminal for the associated Ethernet and TDM interfaces, using the principles for interface layering described in [RFC8343] as a basis.
The data nodes for management of the interface protection functionality is broken out into a separate and generic YANG data module in order to make it also available for other interface types.
The designed YANG data model uses established microwave equipment and radio standards, such as ETSI EN 302 217 2; the IETF Radio Link Model [MICROWAVE RADIO LINK]; and the ONF Microwave Model [ONF model], as the basis for the definition of the detailed leafs/parameters, and it proposes new ones to cover identified gaps, which are analyzed in [RFC8432].
The following terms are used in this document: Carrier Termination (CT) is an interface for the capacity provided over the air by a single carrier.
It is typically defined by its transmitting and receiving frequencies.
Radio Link Terminal (RLT) is an interface providing packet capacity and/or TDM capacity to the associated Ethernet
and/or TDM interfaces in a node and is used for setting up a transport service over a microwave/millimeter wave link.

Explanation of the Microwave Data Model
The leafs in the Interface Management Module augmented by RLT and CT are not always applicable. "
/interfaces/interface/enabled" is not applicable for RLT.
Enable and disable of an interface is done in the constituent CTs.
The packet related measurements "in octets", "in unicast pkts", "in broadcast pkts", "in multicast pkts", "in discards", "in errors", "in unknown protos", "out octets", "out unicast pkts", "out  broadcast pkts", "out multicast pkts", "out discards", and "out  errors" are not within the scope of the microwave radio link domain and therefore are not applicable for RLT and CT.

A switch action initiated by an operator command.
It switches a normal traffic signal to the protection transport entity and forces it to remain on that entity even when criteria for switching back to the original entity are fulfilled."
A switch action temporarily prevents any switch action to be taken and, as such, freezes the current state.
It is lower priority than any 'real' switch request.
Microwave Types YANG Data Model
This module defines a collection of common data types using the YANG data modeling language.
These common types are designed to be imported by other modules defined in the microwave area.

The YANG data models specified in this document define schemas for data that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].
The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory to implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].
The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory to implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].
The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM)
[RFC8341] provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.
There are a number of data nodes defined in these YANG data models that are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the default).
These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
Write operations (e.g., edit config) to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
Interfaces of type microwaveRadioLinkTerminal: /if:interfaces/
if:interface/rlp groups, /if:interfaces/if:interface/xpic pairs, /if:interfaces/if:interface/mimo groups, and /if:interfaces/if:interface/tdm connections: These data nodes represent the configuration of the radio link terminal, and they need to match the configuration of the radio link terminal on the other side of the radio link.
Unauthorized access to these data nodes could interrupt the ability to forward traffic.
Interfaces of type microwaveCarrierTermination: /if:interfaces/
if:interface/duplex distance, /if:interfaces/if:interface/channel separation, /if:interfaces/if:
interface/atpc/maximum nominal power, /if:interfaces/if:interface/atpc/atpc lower threshold, /if:interfaces/if:interface/atpc/atpc upper threshold, /if:interfaces/if:interface/single/selected cm, /if:interfaces/if:interface/adaptive/selected min acm, /if:interfaces/if:interface/adaptive/selected max acm, /if:interfaces/if:interface/if loop, and /if
: These data nodes represent the configuration of the carrier termination, and they need to match the configuration of the carrier termination on the other side of the carrier.
Unauthorized access to these data nodes could interrupt the ability to forward traffic.
Radio link protection: /radio link protection groups/protection group:
This data node represents the configuration of the protection of carrier terminations.
Unauthorized access to this data node could interrupt the ability to forward traffic or remove the ability to perform a necessary protection switch.
/xpic pairs: This data node represents the XPIC configuration of a pair of carriers.
Unauthorized access to this data node could interrupt the ability to forward traffic.
groups: This data node represents the MIMO configuration of multiple carriers.
Unauthorized access to this data node could interrupt the ability to forward traffic.
Some of the RPC operations in this YANG data model may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control access to these operations.
These are the operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
Radio link protection: /radio link protection groups/protection group/manual switch working, /radio link protection groups/protection group/ manual switch protection, /radio link protection groups/protection group/forced switch, /radio link protection groups/protection group/lockout of protection, /radio link protection groups/protection group/freeze, /radio link protection groups/protection group/exercise, and /radio link protection groups/protection group/clear
These data nodes represent actions that might have an impact on the configuration of the protection of carrier terminations.
Unauthorized access to these data nodes could interrupt the ability to forward traffic or remove the ability to perform a necessary protection switch.
The security considerations of [RFC8343] also apply to this document.
