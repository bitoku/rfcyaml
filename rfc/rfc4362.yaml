  - "1.  Introduction\n   Header compression is a technique used to compress and transparently\n\
    \   decompress the header information of a packet on a per-hop basis,\n   utilizing\
    \ redundancy within individual packets and between\n   consecutive packets within\
    \ a packet stream.  Over the years, several\n   protocols [VJHC, IPHC] have been\
    \ developed to compress the network\n   and transport protocol headers [IPv4,\
    \ IPv6, UDP, TCP], and these\n   schemes have been successful in improving efficiency\
    \ over many wired\n   bottleneck links, such as modem connections over telephone\
    \ networks.\n   In addition to IP, UDP, and TCP compression, an additional\n \
    \  compression scheme called Compressed RTP [CRTP] has been developed to\n   improve\
    \ compression efficiency further for real-time traffic using\n   the Real-Time\
    \ Transport Protocol [RTP].\n   The schemes mentioned above have all been designed\
    \ by taking into\n   account normal assumptions about link characteristics, which\n\
    \   traditionally have been based on wired links only.  However, with an\n   increasing\
    \ number of wireless links in the Internet paths, these\n   assumptions are no\
    \ longer generally valid.  In wireless environments,\n   especially wide-coverage\
    \ cellular environments, relatively high error\n   rates are tolerated in order\
    \ to allow efficient usage of the radio\n   resources.  For real-time traffic,\
    \ which is more sensitive to delays\n   than to errors, such operating conditions\
    \ will be norm over, for\n   example, 3rd generation cellular links, and header\
    \ compression must\n   therefore tolerate packet loss.  However, with the previously\n\
    \   mentioned schemes, especially for real-time traffic compressed by\n   CRTP,\
    \ high error rates have been shown to significantly degrade\n   header compression\
    \ performance [CRTPC].  This problem was the driving\n   force behind the creation\
    \ of the RObust Header Compression (ROHC) WG\n   in the IETF.\n   The ROHC WG\
    \ has developed a header compression framework on top of\n   which profiles can\
    \ be defined for different protocol sets, or for\n   different compression strategies.\
    \  Due to the limited packet-loss\n   robustness of CRTP and the demands of the\
    \ cellular industry for an\n   efficient way of transporting voice over IP over\
    \ wireless, the main\n   focus of ROHC has so far been on compression of IP/UDP/RTP\
    \ headers,\n   which are generous in size, especially when compared to the payloads\n\
    \   often carried by packets with such headers.\n   ROHC RTP has become a very\
    \ efficient, robust, and capable compression\n   scheme, able to compress the\
    \ headers down to a total size of one\n   octet only.  Also, transparency is guaranteed\
    \ to an extremely great\n   extent, even when residual bit errors are present\
    \ in compressed\n   headers delivered to the decompressor.  The requirements for\
    \ RTP\n   compression [RTP-REQ], defined by the WG before and during the\n   development\
    \ process, have thus been fulfilled.\n   As mentioned above, the 3rd generation\
    \ cellular systems, where IP\n   will be used end-to-end, have been one of the\
    \ driving forces behind\n   ROHC RTP, and the scheme has also been designed to\
    \ suit new cellular\n   air interfaces, such as WCDMA, making it possible to run\
    \ even speech\n   services with spectrum efficiency insignificantly lower than\
    \ for\n   existing one-service circuit switched solutions [VTC2000].  However,\n\
    \   other air interfaces (such as those based on GSM and IS-95) will also\n  \
    \ be used in all-IP networks, with further implications for the header\n   compression\
    \ issue.  These older air interfaces are less flexible,\n   with radio bearers\
    \ optimized for specific payload sizes.  This means\n   that not even a single\
    \ octet of header can be added without using the\n   next higher fixed packet\
    \ size supported by the link, something that\n   is obviously very costly.  For\
    \ the already deployed speech vocoders,\n   the spectrum efficiency over these\
    \ links will thus be low compared to\n   existing circuit-switched solutions.\
    \  To achieve high spectrum\n   efficiency overall with any application, more\
    \ flexible air interfaces\n   must be deployed, and then the ROHC RTP scheme will\
    \ perform\n   excellently, as shown for WCDMA [MOMUC01].  However, for deployment\n\
    \   reasons, it is important to also provide a suitable header\n   compression\
    \ strategy for already existing vocoders and air\n   interfaces, such as for GERAN\
    \ and for CDMA2000, with minimal effects\n   on spectral efficiency.\n   This\
    \ document describes a link-layer-assisted ROHC RTP profile,\n   originally defined\
    \ by [LLA], extending ROHC RTP (profile 0x0001)\n   [ROHC], and compliant with\
    \ the ROHC 0-byte requirements [0B-REQ].\n   The purpose of this profile is to\
    \ provide a header-free packet format\n   that, for a certain application behavior,\
    \ can replace a majority of\n   the 1-octet header ROHC RTP packets during normal\
    \ U/O-mode operation,\n   while still being fully transparent and complying with\
    \ all the\n   requirements of ROHC RTP [RTP-REQ].  For other applications,\n \
    \  compression will be carried out as with normal ROHC RTP.\n   To completely\
    \ eliminate the compressed header, all functionality\n   normally provided by\
    \ the 1-octet header has to be provided by other\n   means, typically by utilizing\
    \ functionality provided by the lower\n   layers and sacrificing efficiency for\
    \ less-frequently occurring\n   larger compressed headers.  The latter is not\
    \ a contradiction, since\n   the argument for eliminating the last octet for most\
    \ packets is not\n   overall efficiency in general.  It is important to remember\
    \ that the\n   purpose of this profile is to provide efficient matching of existing\n\
    \   applications to existing link technologies, not efficiency in\n   general.\
    \  The additional complexity introduced by this profile,\n   although minimized\
    \ by a tight integration with already-existing ROHC\n   functionality, implies\
    \ that it should therefore only be used to\n   optimize performance of specific\
    \ applications over specific links.\n   When implementing this profile over various\
    \ link technologies, care\n   must be taken to guarantee that all the functionality\
    \ needed is\n   provided by ROHC and the lower layers together.  Therefore,\n\
    \   additional documents should specify how to incorporate this profile\n   on\
    \ top of various link technologies.\n   The profile defined by this document was\
    \ originally specified by RFC\n   3242 [LLA], but to address one technical flaw\
    \ and clarify one\n   implementation issue, this document has been issued to replace\
    \ RFC\n   3242, which becomes obsolete.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Differences from RFC 3242\n   This section briefly summarizes the differences\
    \ of this document from\n   RFC 3242.  Acronyms and terminology can be found in\
    \ Section 2.\n   The format of the CSP packet, as defined in [LLA], was identified\
    \ as\n   non-interoperable when carrying a RHP header with a 3-bit or 7-bit\n\
    \   CRC.  This problem occurs because the payload has been dropped by the\n  \
    \ compressor, and the decompressor is supposed to use the payload\n   length to\
    \ infer certain fields in the uncompressed header.  These\n   fields are the IPv4\
    \ total length, the IPv6 payload length, the UDP\n   length, and the IPv4 header\
    \ checksum field (all INFERRED fields in\n   [ROHC]).  To correct this flaw, the\
    \ CSP packet must carry information\n   about the payload length of the RHP packet.\
    \  Therefore, the length of\n   the RTP payload has been included in the CSP packet.\n\
    \   This document also clarifies an unclear referencing in RFC 3242,\n   where\
    \ Section 4.1.3 of [LLA] states that upon CRC failure, the\n   actions of [ROHC],\
    \ Section 5.3.2.2.3 MUST be taken.  That section\n   specifies that detection\
    \ of SN wraparound and local repair must be\n   performed, but neither of these\
    \ steps apply when the failing packet\n   is a CCP.  Therefore, upon CRC failure,\
    \ actions to be taken are the\n   ones specified in Section 5.3.2.2.3, but steps\
    \ a-d only.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Providing Packet Type Identification
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Providing Packet Type Identification\n   All ROHC headers carry a packet\
    \ type identifier, indicating to the\n   decompressor how the header should be\
    \ interpreted.  This is a\n   function that must be provided by some means in\
    \ 0-byte header\n   compression.  It will be possible to distinguish ROHC RTP\
    \ packets\n   with compressed headers thanks to the packet type identifier, but\
    \ a\n   mechanism is needed to separate packets with a header from packets\n \
    \  without a header.  This function MUST therefore be provided by the\n   assisting\
    \ layer in one way or another.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Replacing the Sequence Number
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Replacing the Sequence Number\n   From the sending application, the RTP\
    \ sequence number is increased by\n   one for each packet sent.  The purpose of\
    \ the sequence number is to\n   cope with packet reordering and packet loss. \
    \ If reordering or loss\n   has occurred before the transmission point, the compressing\
    \ side, if\n   needed, can easily avoid problems by not allowing the use of a\n\
    \   header-free packet.\n   However, at the transmission point, loss or reordering\
    \ that may occur\n   over the link can not be anticipated and covered for.  Therefore,\
    \ for\n   NHP, the assisting layer MUST guarantee in-order delivery over the\n\
    \   link (already assumed by [ROHC]), and at the receiving side, it MUST\n   provide\
    \ an indication for each packet loss over the link.  This is\n   basically the\
    \ same principle as that which the VJ header compression\n   [VJHC] relies on.\n\
    \   Note that guaranteeing in-order delivery and packet loss indication\n   over\
    \ the link not only makes it possible to infer the sequence number\n   information,\
    \ but also supersedes the main function of the CRC, which\n   normally takes care\
    \ of errors due to link losses and bit errors in\n   the compressed sequence number.\n"
- title: 3.3.  CRC Replacement
  contents:
  - "3.3.  CRC Replacement\n   All context-updating RRP packets carry a CRC calculated\
    \ over the\n   uncompressed header.  The CRC is used by the decompressor to verify\n\
    \   that the updated context is correct.  This verification serves three\n   purposes\
    \ in U/O-mode:\n      1) Detection of longer losses than can be covered by the\
    \ sequence\n         number LSBs.\n      2) Protection against failures caused\
    \ by residual bit errors in\n         compressed headers.\n      3) Protection\
    \ against faulty implementations and other causes of\n         error.\n   Since\
    \ this profile defines an NHP packet without this CRC, care must\n   be taken\
    \ to fulfill these purposes by other means when an NHP is used\n   as a replacement\
    \ for a context-updating packet.  Detection of long\n   losses (1) is already\
    \ covered, since the assisting layer MUST provide\n   an indication of all packet\
    \ losses.  Furthermore, the NHP packet has\n   one important advantage over RHP\
    \ packets in that residual bit errors\n   (2) cannot damage a header that is not\
    \ even sent.\n   It is thus reasonable to assume that compression and decompression\n\
    \   transparency can be assured with high confidence, even without a CRC\n   in\
    \ header-free packets.  However, to provide additional protection\n   against\
    \ damage propagation due to undetected residual bit errors in\n   context-updating\
    \ packets (2) or other unexpected errors (3), periodic\n   context verifications\
    \ SHOULD be performed (see Section 4.6).\n"
- title: 3.4.  Applicability of This Profile
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Applicability of This Profile\n   The LLA profile can be used with any\
    \ link technology capable of\n   providing the required functionality described\
    \ in previous sections.\n   Thus, whether LLA or ROHC RTP should be implemented\
    \ depends on the\n   characteristics of the link itself.  For most RTP packet\
    \ streams, LLA\n   will work exactly as ROHC RTP, and it will have a higher compression\n\
    \   efficiency for packet streams with certain characteristics.  LLA will\n  \
    \ never have a lower compression efficiency than ROHC RTP.\n   Note as well that\
    \ LLA, like all other ROHC profiles, is fully\n   transparent to any packet stream\
    \ reaching the compressor.  LLA does\n   not make any assumptions about the packet\
    \ stream but will perform\n   optimally for packet streams with certain characteristics,\
    \ e.g.,\n   synchronized streams exactly timed with the assisting link over which\n\
    \   the LLA profile is implemented.\n   The LLA profile is obviously not applicable\
    \ if the UDP checksum (2\n   bytes) is enabled, which is always the case for IPv6/UDP.\
    \  For\n   IPv4/UDP, the sender may choose to disable the UDP checksum.\n"

    \   bit of the second octet, the C bit, indicates whether the CRC field\n   is\

    \  An assisting layer MAY use the CCP for other\n   purposes, such as signaling\
    \ a packet loss before the link.\n   The decompressor is REQUIRED to handle a\
    \ CCP received with the C bit\n   set (C=1), indicating a valid CRC field, and\
    \ to perform context\n   verification.  The received CRC MUST then be applied\
    \ to the last\n   decompressed packet, unless a packet loss indication was previously\n\

    \ by the decompressor.  The decompressor is not allowed\n   to make any further\
    \ interpretation of the CCP.\n   When using the 7-bit CRC in the CCP packet to\
    \ verify the context, the\n   decompressor needs to have access to the entire\
    \ uncompressed header\n   of the latest packet decompressed.  Some implementations\

- title: 4.3.  Optimistic Approach Agreement
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Optimistic Approach Agreement\n   ROHC defines an optimistic approach for\

    \ in the Optimistic and\n   Unidirectional modes of operation.  Due to the presence\
    \ of a CRC in\n   all compressed headers, the optimistic approach is defined as\
    \ a\n   compressor issue only because the decompressor will always be able to\n\
    \   detect an invalid context through the CRC verification.\n   However, no CRC\
    \ is present in the NHP packet defined by the LLA\n   profile.  Therefore, the\
    \ loss of an RHP packet updating the context\n   may not always be detected. \
    \ To avoid this problem, the compressing\n   and decompressing sides must agree\
    \ on the principles for the\n   optimistic approach, and the agreed principles\
    \ MUST be enforced not\n   only by the compressor but also by the transmitting\
    \ assisting layer.\n   If, for example, three consecutive updates are sent to\
    \ convey a\n   header field change, the decompressor must know this and invalidate\n\
    \   the context if three or more consecutive physical packets are lost.\n   Note\
    \ that the mechanism used to enforce the optimistic approach must\n   be reinitialized\
    \ if a new field change needs to be conveyed while the\n   compressing side is\
    \ already sending packets to convey non-linear\n   context updates.\n   An LLA\
    \ decompressor MUST use the optimistic approach knowledge to\n   detect possible\
    \ context loss events.  If context loss is suspected,\n   it MUST invalidate the\
    \ context and not forward any packets before the\n   context has been synchronized.\n\
    \   It is REQUIRED that all documents describing how the LLA profile is\n   implemented\
    \ over a certain link technology define how the optimistic\n   approach is agreed\
    \ to between the compressing side and the\n   decompressing side.  It could be\

    \ once every N packets,\n      where N=VERIFICATION_PERIOD (see Section 4.6).\n\

  - "5.1.2.  Implementation Parameters at the Decompressor\n   NHP_PACKET -- value:\
    \ boolean\n      This parameter informs the decompressor that the packet being\n\
    \      delivered is an NHP packet.  The decompressor MUST accept this\n      packet\
    \ type indicator from the lower layer.  An assisting layer\n      MUST set this\
    \ indicator to true for every NHP packet delivered,\n      and to false for any\
    \ other packet.\n   PHYSICAL_PACKET_LOSS -- signal\n      This signal indicates\
    \ to the decompressor that a packet has been\n      lost on the link between the\
    \ compressing and the decompressing\n      sides, due to a physical link error.\
    \  The signal is given once for\n      each packet that was lost, and a decompressor\
    \ must increase the\n      sequence number accordingly when this signal is received.\n\
    \   PRE_LINK_PACKET_LOSS -- signal\n      This signal tells the decompressor to\
    \ increase the sequence number\n      due to a gap in the sequencing not related\
    \ to a physical link\n      error.  A receiving assisting layer may, for example,\
    \ use this\n      signal to indicate to the decompressor that a packet was lost\n\
    \      before the compressor, or that a packet was discarded by the\n      transmitting\
    \ assisting layer.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.2.  Implementation over Various Link Technologies\n   This document provides\
    \ the semantics and requirements of the\n   interface needed from the ROHC compressor\
    \ and decompressor towards\n   the assisting layer to perform link-layer-assisted\
    \ header\n   compression.\n   However, this document does not provide any link-layer-specific\n\
    \   operational information, except for some implementation suggestions.\n   Further\
    \ details about how this profile is to be implemented over\n   various link technologies\
    \ must be described in other documents, where\n   specific characteristics of\
    \ each link layer can be taken into account\n   to provide optimal usage of this\
    \ profile.\n   These specifications MAY use a packet-type bit pattern unused by\
    \ this\n   profile to implement signaling on the lower layer.  The pattern\n \
    \  available to lower layer implementations is [11111001].\n"

  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   ROHC profile identifier 0x0005 has been reserved\

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of ROHC RTP [ROHC,\
    \ Section 7] apply also\n   to this document, with one addition: in the case of\
    \ a denial-of-\n   service attack scenario where an intruder injects bogus CCP\
    \ packets\n   using random CRC values onto the link, the CRC check will fail for\n\
    \   incorrect reasons at the decompressor side.  This would obviously\n   greatly\
    \ reduce the advantages of ROHC and any extra efficiency\n   provided by this\
    \ profile due to unnecessary context invalidation,\n   feedback messages, and\
    \ refresh packets.  However, the same remarks\n   related to the presence of such\
    \ an intruder apply.\n"
