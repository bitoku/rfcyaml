  - "                  Announcing Addtional Telnet Options\n   This is to announce\
    \ the set of Telnet Options defined in Request For\n   Comments 651 through 658\
    \ (NIC 31154 through 31161) are part of the\n   official Telnet Options and should\
    \ be added to the Protocol Notebook.\n   RFC 651 is a revision of the Status Option\
    \ to utilize the subcommand\n   feature and reduce the number of bits required\
    \ to convey the status\n   information.  This revised Status Option replaces the\
    \ previous Status\n   Option.\n   The other RFCs (652 through 658) are new Options\
    \ for controlling the\n   behavior of the format effector characters Carriage\
    \ Return,\n   Horizontal Tab, Form Feed, Vertical Tab, and Line Feed.\n   Your\
    \ attention is also called to RFC 645 (NIC 30899) \"Network\n   Standard Data\
    \ Specification Syntax\" which was prepared some time ago\n   but has not received\
    \ wide circulation.\n   Unfortunately the Network Information Center can not provide\
    \ hardcopy\n   documents.  Currently the author is responsible for distribution\
    \ of\n   RFCs.\n   The documents are available online as:\n      [ISI]<DCROCKER>STATUS-OPTION-REVISION.TXT\n\
