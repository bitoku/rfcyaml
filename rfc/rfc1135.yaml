    \         Keaton, Beetlejuice\n   Defining \"worm\" versus \"virus\"\n      A\
    \ \"worm\" is a program that can run independently, will consume the\n      resources\
    \ of its host from within in order to maintain itself, and\n      can propagate\
    \ a complete working version of itself on to other\n      machines.\n      A \"\
    virus\" is a piece of code that inserts itself into a host,\n      including operating\
    \ systems, to propagate.  It cannot run\n      independently.  It requires that\
    \ its host program be run to\n      activate it.\n      In the early stages of\
    \ the helminthiasis, the news media popularly\n      cited the Internet worm to\
    \ be a \"virus\", which was attributed to\n      an early conclusion of some in\
    \ the computer community before a\n      specimen of the worm could be extracted\
    \ and dissected.  There are\n      some computer scientists that still argue over\
    \ what to call the\n      affliction.  In this RFC, we use the term, \"worm\"\
    .\n   1.1  Infection - The Worm Attacks\n      The worm specifically and only\
    \ made successful attacks on SUN\n      workstations and VAXes running Berkeley\
    \ UNIX code.\n      The Internet worm relied on the several known access loopholes\
    \ in\n      order to propagate over networks.  It relied on implementation\n \
    \     errors in two network programs: sendmail and fingerd.\n      Sendmail is\
    \ a program that implements the Internet's electronic\n      mail services (routing\
    \ and delivery) interacting with remote sites\n      [1, 2].  The feature in sendmail\
    \ that was violated was a non-\n      standard \"debug\" command.  The worm propagated\
    \ itself via the\n      debug command into remote hosts.  As the worm installed\
    \ itself in\n      a new host the new instance began self-replicating.\n     \
    \ Fingerd is a utility program that is intended to help remote\n      Internet\
    \ users by supplying public information about other\n      Internet users.  This\
    \ can be in the form of identification of the\n      full name of, or login name\
    \ of any local user, whether or not they\n      are logged in at the time (see\
    \ the Finger Protocol [3]).\n      Using fingerd, the worm initiated a memory\
    \ overflow situation by\n      sending too many characters for fingerd to accommodate\
    \ (in the\n      gets library routine).  Upon overflowing the storage space, the\n\
    \      worm was able to execute a small arbitrary program.  Only 4.3BSD\n    \
    \  VAX machines suffered from this attack.\n      Another of the worm's methods\
    \ was to exploit the \"trusted host\n      features\" often used in local networks\
    \ to propagate (using rexec\n      and rsh).\n      It also infected machines\
    \ in /etc/hosts.equiv, machines in\n      /.rhosts, machines in cracked accounts'\
    \ .forward files, machines\n      cracked accounts' .rhosts files, machines listed\
    \ as network\n      gateways in routing tables, machines at the far end of point-to-\n\
    \      point interfaces, and other machines at randomly guessed addresses\n  \
    \    on networks of first hop gateways.\n      The Internet worm was also able\
    \ to infect systems using guessed\n      passwords, typically spreading itself\
    \ within local networks by\n      this method.  It tried to guess passwords, and\
    \ upon gaining\n      access, the worm was able to pose as a legitimate user.\n\
    \   1.2  Festering - Password Cracking\n      The worm festered by going into\
    \ a password cracking phase,\n      attempting to access accounts with obvious\
    \ passwords (using clues\n      readily available in the /etc/passwd file), such\
    \ as: none at all,\n      the user name, the user name appended to itself, the\
    \ \"nickname\",\n      the last name, the last name spelled backwards.  It also\
    \ tried\n      breaking into into accounts with passwords from a personalized\
    \ 432\n      word dictionary, and accounts with passwords in /usr/dict/words.\n\
    \      Most users encountered a slowing of their programs, as the systems\n  \
    \    became overloaded trying to run many copies of the worm program,\n      or\
    \ a lack of file space if many copies of the worm's temporary\n      files existed\
    \ concurrently.  Actually, the worm was very careful\n      to hide itself and\
    \ leave little evidence of its passage through a\n      system.  The users at\
    \ the infected sites may have seen strange\n      files that showed up in the\
    \ /usr/tmp directories of some machines\n      and obscure messages appeared in\
    \ the log files of sendmail.\n   1.3  The Cure\n      Teams of computer science\
    \ students and staff worked feverishly to\n      understand the worm.  The key\
    \ was seen to get a source (C\n      language) version of the program.  Since\
    \ the only isolated\n      instances of the the worm were binary code, a major\
    \ effort was\n      made to translate back to source, that is decompile the code,\
    \ and\n      to study just what damage the worm was capable of.  Two specific\n\
    \      teams emerged in the battle against the Internet worm: the\n      Berkeley\
    \ Team and the MIT team.  They communicated and exchanged\n      code extensively.\
    \  Both teams were able to scrutinize it and take\n      immediate action on a\
    \ cure and prevent reinfection.  Just like\n      regular medical Doctors, the\
    \ teams searched, found and isolated a\n      worm specimen which they could study.\
    \  Upon analyzing the specimen\n      and the elements of its design, they set\
    \ about to develop methods\n      to treat and defeat it.  Through the use of\
    \ the \"old boy network\"\n      of UNIX system wizards (to find out something,\
    \ one asks an\n      associate or friend if they know the answer or who else they\
    \ could\n      refer to to find out the answer), email and phone calls were\n\
    \      extensively used to alert the computer world of the program\n      patches\
    \ that could be used at sites to close the sendmail hole and\n      fingerd holes.\
    \  Once the information was disseminated to the sites\n      and these holes were\
    \ patched, the Internet worm was stopped.  It\n      could not reinfect the same\
    \ computers again, unless the worm was\n      still sitting in an infected trusted\
    \ host computer.\n      The Internet worm was eliminated from most computers within\
    \ 48-72\n      hours after it had appeared, specifically through the efforts of\n\
    \      computer science staffs at the University research centers.\n      Government\
    \ and Commercial agencies apparently were slow in coming\n      around to recognizing\
    \ the helminthiasis and eradicating it.\n"

  - "2.  Impact\n         ----- \"Off with his head!!!\" ----- The Red Queen,\n  \
    \       Alice in Wonderland\n   Two lines have been drawn in the computer community\
    \ in the aftermath\n   of the Internet worm of November 1988.  One group contends\
    \ that the\n   release of the worm program was a naive accident, and that the\
    \ worm\n   \"escaped\" during testing.  Yet, when the worm program was unleashed,\n\
    \   it was obvious it was spreading unchecked.  Another group argues that\n  \
    \ the worm was deliberately released to blatantly point out security\n   defects\
    \ to a community that was aware of the problems, but were\n   complacent about\
    \ fixing them.  Yet, one does not necessarily need to\n   deliberately disrupt\
    \ the entire world in order to report a problem.\n   Both groups agree that the\
    \ community cannot condone worm infestation\n   whether \"experimental\" or \"\
    deliberate\" as a means to heighten public\n   awareness, as the consequences\
    \ of such irresponsible acts can be\n   devastating.  Meanwhile, several in the\
    \ news media stated that the\n   author of the worm did the computer community\
    \ a favor by exposing the\n   security flaws, and that bugs and security flaws\
    \ will not get fixed\n   without such drastic measures as the Internet worm program.\n\
    \   In the short term, the worm program did heighten the computer\n   community's\
    \ awareness of security flaws.  Also, the \"old boy network\"\n   proved it was\
    \ still alive and well!  While networking and computers\n   as a whole have grown\
    \ by leaps and bounds in the last twenty years,\n   the Internet community still\
    \ has the \"old boys\" who trust and\n   communicate well with each other in the\
    \ face of adversity.\n   In the long term, all results of the helminthiasis are\
    \ not complete.\n   Many sites have either placed restrictions on access to their\n\
    \   machines, and a few have chosen to remove themselves from the\n   Internet\
    \ entirely.  The legal consequences of the Internet worm\n   program as a computer\
    \ crime are still pending, and may stay in that\n   condition into the next decade.\n\
    \   Yet, the problem of computer crime is, on a layman's level, a social\n   one.\
    \  Legal statutes, which notoriously are legislated after the\n   fact, are only\
    \ one element of the solution.  Development of\n   enforceable ethical standards\
    \ that are universally agreed on in the\n   computer community, coupled with enforceable\
    \ laws should help\n   eradicate computer crime.\n"

    \ properly,\n         you'd better know every rule.\" ----- Barbara Jordan\n \
    \  Ethical behavior is that of conforming to accepted professional\n   standards\
    \ of conduct; dealing with what is good or bad within a set\n   of moral principles\
    \ or values.  Up until recently, most computer\n   professionals and groups have\
    \ not been overly concerned with\n   questions of ethics.\n   Organizations and\
    \ computer professional groups have recently, in the\n   aftermath of the Internet\
    \ worm, issued their own \"Statement of\n   Ethics\".  Ethics statements published\
    \ by the Internet Activities\n   Board (IAB), the National Science Foundation\
    \ (NSF), the Massachusetts\n   Institute of Technology (MIT), and the Computer\
    \ Professionals for\n   Social Responsibility (CPSR) are discussed below.\n  \
    \ 3.1  The IAB\n      The IAB issued a statement of policy concerning the proper\
    \ use of\n      the resources of the Internet in January, 1989 [4] (and reprinted\n\
    \      in the Communications of the ACM, June 1989).  An excerpt:\n      The Internet\
    \ is a national facility whose utility is largely a\n      consequence of its\
    \ wide availability and accessibility.\n      Irresponsible use of this critical\
    \ resource poses an enormous\n      threat to its continued availability to the\
    \ technical community.\n      The U.S. Government sponsors of this system have\
    \ a fiduciary\n      responsibility to the public to allocate government resources\n\
    \      wisely and effectively.  Justification for the support of this\n      system\
    \ suffers when highly disruptive abuses occur.  Access to and\n      use of the\
    \ Internet is a privilege and should be treated as such\n      by all users of\
    \ this system.\n      The IAB strongly endorses the view of the Division Advisory\
    \ Panel\n      of the National Science Foundation Division of Network,\n     \
    \ Communications Research and Infrastructure which, in paraphrase,\n      characterized\
    \ as unethical and unacceptable any activity which\n      purposely:\n       \
    \  (a) seeks to gain unauthorized access to the resources of the\n           \
    \  Internet,\n         (b) disrupts the intended use of the Internet,\n      \
    \   (c) wastes resources (people, capacity, computer) through such\n         \
    \    actions,\n         (d) destroys the integrity of computer-based information,\
    \ and/or\n         (e) compromises the privacy of users.\n      The Internet exists\
    \ in the general research milieu.  Portions of\n      it continue to be used to\
    \ support research and experimentation on\n      networking.  Because experimentation\
    \ on the Internet has the\n      potential to affect all of its components and\
    \ users, researchers\n      have the responsibility to exercise great caution\
    \ in the conduct\n      of their work.  Negligence in the conduct of Internet-wide\n\
    \      experiments is both irresponsible and unacceptable.\n      The IAB plans\
    \ to take whatever actions it can, in concert with\n      Federal agencies and\
    \ other interested parties, to identify and to\n      set up technical and procedural\
    \ mechanisms to make the Internet\n      more resistant to disruption.  Such security,\
    \ however, may be\n      extremely expensive and may be counterproductive if it\
    \ inhibits\n      the free flow of information which makes the Internet so valuable.\n\
    \      In the final analysis, the health and well-being of the Internet\n    \
    \  is the responsibility of its users who must, uniformly, guard\n      against\
    \ abuses which disrupt the system and threaten its long-term\n      viability.\n\
    \   3.2  NSF\n      The NSF issued an ethical network use statement on 30 November\n\
    \      1988, during the regular meeting of the Division Advisory Panel\n     \
    \ for Networking and Communications Research and Infrastructure (and\n      reprinted\
    \ in the Communications of the ACM (June of 1989) [5]),\n      that stated, in\
    \ part:\n      The Division Advisory Panel (DAP) of the NSF Division of\n    \
    \  Networking and Communication Research and Infrastructure (DNCRI)\n      deplores\
    \ lapses of ethical behavior which cause disruption to our\n      national network\
    \ resources.  Industry, government, and academe\n      have established computer\
    \ networks in support of research and\n      scholarship.  Recent events have\
    \ accentuated the importance of\n      establishing community standards for the\
    \ ethical use of networks.\n      In this regard, the DNCRI DAP defines as unethical\
    \ any activity\n      which purposefully or through negligence:\n         a. disrupts\
    \ the intended use of the networks,\n         b. wastes resources through such\
    \ actions (people, bandwidth or\n            computer),\n         c. destroys\
    \ the integrity of computer-based information,\n         d. compromises the privacy\
    \ of users,\n         e. consumes unplanned resources for control and eradication.\n\
    \      We encourage organizations managing and operating networks to\n      adopt\
    \ and publicize policies and standards for ethical behavior.\n      We also encourage\
    \ these organizations to adopt administrative\n      procedures to enforce appropriate\
    \ disciplinary responses to\n      violations and to work with appropriate bodies\
    \ on drafting\n      legislation in this area.\n   3.3  MIT\n      MIT issued\
    \ a statement of ethics entitled, \"Teaching Students\n      About Responsible\
    \ Use of Computers\" in 1985-1986 (and reprinted in\n      the Communications\
    \ of the ACM (June 1989) [6]).  The official\n      statement of ethics specifically\
    \ outlined MIT's position on the\n      intended use, privacy and security, system\
    \ integrity, and\n      intellectual property rights.\n      Those standards,\
    \ outlined in the MIT Bulletin under academic\n      procedures, call for all\
    \ members of the community to act in a\n      responsible, ethical, and professional\
    \ way.  The members of the\n      MIT community also carry the responsibility\
    \ to use the system in\n      accordance with MIT's standards of honesty and personal\
    \ conduct.\n   3.4  CPSR\n      The CPSR issued a statement on the Computer Virus\
    \ in November 1988\n      (and reprinted in the Communications of the ACM (June\
    \ 1989) [7]).\n      The CPSR believes:\n      The incident should prompt critical\
    \ review of our dependence on\n      complex computer networks, particularly for\
    \ military and defense-\n      related function.  The flaws that permitted the\
    \ recent virus to\n      spread will eventually be fixed, but other flaws will\
    \ remain.\n      Security loopholes are inevitable in any computer network and\
    \ are\n      prevalent in those that support general-purpose computing and are\n\
    \      widely accessible.\n      An effective way to correct known security flaws\
    \ is to publish\n      descriptions of the flaws so that they can be corrected.\
    \  We\n      therefore view the effort to conceal technical descriptions of the\n\
    \      recent virus as short-sighted.\n      CPSR believes that innovation, creativity,\
    \ and the open exchange\n      of ideas are the ingredients of scientific advancement\
    \ and\n      technological achievement.  Computer networks, such as the\n    \
    \  Internet, facilitate this exchange.  We cannot afford policies\n      that\
    \ might restrict the ability of computer researchers to\n      exchange their\
    \ ideas with one another.  More secure networks, such\n      as military and financial\
    \ networks, sharply restrict access and\n      offer limited functionality.  Government,\
    \ industry, and the\n      university community should support the continued development\
    \ of\n      network technology that provides open access to many users.\n    \
    \  The computer virus has sent a clear warning to the computing\n      community\
    \ and to society at large.  We hope it will provoke a long\n      overdue public\
    \ discussion about the vulnerabilities of computer\n      networks, and the technological,\
    \ ethical, and legal choices we\n      must address.\n"

    \ Eichin and Rochlis, \"We were\n   unable to show the T.V. crew anything \"visual\"\

  - "5.  Crime in the Computer World\n         ----- \"A recent survey by the American\
    \ Bar Association\n         found that almost one-half of those companies and\n\
    \         Government agencies that responded had been victimized\n         by\
    \ some form of computer crime.  The known financial loss\n         from those\
    \ crimes was estimated as high as $730 million,\n         and the report concluded\
    \ that computer crime is among\n         the worst white-collar offenses.\" -----\
    \ The Computer\n         Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986\n   The term White Collar\
    \ crime was first used by Edwin Sutherland, a\n   noted American criminologist,\
    \ in 1939.  Sutherland contended that the\n   popular view of crime as primarily\
    \ a lower class (Blue Collar)\n   activity was based on the failure to consider\
    \ the activities of the\n   robber barons and captains of industry who violated\
    \ the law with\n   virtual impunity.\n   In this day and age, White Collar crime\
    \ refers to violations of the\n   law committed by salaried or professional persons\
    \ in conjunction with\n   their work.  Computer crimes are identified and included\
    \ in this\n   classification.  Yet, law enforcement agencies have historically\
    \ paid\n   little attention to this new phenomenon.  When a trial and conviction\n\
    \   does occur, it's resulted more often in a fine and probation, than a\n   prison\
    \ term.  A shift became apparent in the late 1970s, when the\n   FBI's ABSCAM\
    \ investigation (1978-80) resulted in the conviction of\n   several U.S. legislators\
    \ for bribery and related charges.\n   The legal implication of the Internet worm\

    \   What roles can the computer community as a whole, play in preventing\n   such\
    \ outbreaks?  Why were many people aware of the debug problem in\n   the sendmail\
    \ program and the overflow problem in fingerd, yet,\n   appropriate fixes were\

    \     1) Computer ethics must be taken seriously.  A standard for\n          \
    \  computer ethics is extremely important for the new groups of\n            computer\
    \ professionals graduating out of Universities.  The\n            \"old\" professionals\
    \ and \"new\" professionals who use\n            computers are ALL responsible\
    \ for their applications.\n         2) The \"powers that be\" of the Internet\
    \ (IAB, DARPA, NSF, etc.)\n            should pursue the current problems in network\
    \ security, and\n            cause the flaws to be fixed.\n         3) The openness\
    \ and free flow of information of networking\n            should be rightfully\
    \ preserved, as it demonstrated its worth\n            during the helminthiasis\
    \ by expediting the analysis and cure\n            of the infestation.\n     \
    \    4) Promote and coordinate the establishment of committees or\n          \
    \  agency \"police\" panels that would handle, judge, and enforce\n          \
    \  violations based on a universally set standard of computer\n            ethics.\n\
    \         5) The continued incidences of \"computer crime\" show a lack of\n \
    \           professionalism and ethical standards in the computer\n          \
    \  community.  Ethics statements like those discussed in this\n            RFC,\

    \ Office of\n      Information Technologies (Chair), and Thomas Santoro, Office\
    \ of\n      the University Counsel.\n      An introduction set the stage of the\
    \ intent and purpose of the\n      Commission:\n         1)  Accumulate all evidence\
    \ concerning the involvement\n             of the alleged Cornell University Computer\
    \ Science\n             graduate student in the worm infestation of the Internet,\n\
    \             and to assess the gathered evidence to determine the\n         \
    \    alleged graduate student was the perpetrator.\n         2)  Accumulate all\
    \ evidence concerning the potential\n             involvement of any other members\
    \ of the Cornell University\n             community, and to assess such evidence\
    \ to determine\n             whether or not any other members of the Cornell University\n\
    \             community was involved in unleashing the worm on to the\n      \
    \       Internet, or knew of the potential worm infestation ahead\n          \
    \   of time.\n         3)  Evaluate relevant computer policies and procedures\
    \ to\n             determine which, if any, were violated and to make\n      \
    \       preliminary recommendations to the Provost as to\n             whether\
    \ any of such policies and procedures should be\n             modified to inhibit\
    \ potential future security violations\n             of this general type.\n \
    \     In the summary of findings and comments, the Commission named the\n    \
    \  Cornell University first year Computer Science graduate student\n      that\
    \ allegedly created the worm and unleashed it on to the\n      Internet.  The\
    \ findings section also discussed:\n         1)  the impact of the invasion of\
    \ the worm,\n         2)  the mitigation attempts to stop the worm,\n        \
    \ 3)  the violation of computer abuse policies,\n         4)  the intent,\n  \
    \       5)  security attitudes and knowledge,\n         6)  technical sophistication,\n\
    \         7)  Cornell's involvement,\n         8)  ethical considerations,\n \
    \        9)  community sentiment,\n         10) and Cornell University's policies\
    \ on computer abuse.\n      The report concluded that the worm program's gathering\
    \ of\n      unauthorized passwords and the dissemination of the worm over a\n\
    \      national network were wrong.  The Commission also disclaimed that\n   \
    \   contrary to media reports, Cornell University DID NOT condone the\n      worm\
    \ infection, nor heralded the unleashing of the worm program as\n      a heroic\
    \ event.  The Commission did continue to encourage the free\n      flow of scholarly\
    \ research and reasonable trust within the\n      University/Research communities.\n\
    \      A background on the worm program, methods of investigation, an\n      introduction\
    \ to the evidence, an interpretation and findings,\n      acknowledgements, and\
    \ an extensive appendices were also included\n      in the Commission's report.\n\
    \   7.2  \"With Microscope and Tweezers: An Analysis of the Internet\n       \
    \ Virus of November 1988\"\n      Eichin and Rochlis' \"With Microscope and Tweezers:\
    \ An Analysis of\n      the Internet Virus of November 1988\", provides a detailed\n\
    \      dissection of the worm program.  The paper discusses the major\n      points\
    \ of the worm program then reviews strategies, chronology,\n      lessons and\
    \ open issues, acknowledgements; also included are a\n      detailed appendix\
    \ on the worm program subroutine by subroutine, an\n      appendix on the cast\
    \ of characters, and a reference section.\n      A discussion of the terms \"\
    worm\" versus \"virus\" is presented.\n      These authors concluded that it was\
    \ a \"virus\" infection, not worm\n      infection.  Thus they use the term \"\
    virus\" in their document.  In\n      Section 1, goals and targets by the teams\
    \ of computer scientists\n      were defined.  There were three steps taken to\
    \ find out the inner\n      workings of the virus:\n         - isolating a specimen\
    \ of the virus in a form\n           which could be analyzed.\n         - \"decompiling\"\
    \ the virus, into a form that could\n           be shown to reduce to the executable\
    \ of the real\n           things, so that the higher level version could be\n\
    \           interpreted.\n         - analyzing the strategies used by the virus,\
    \ and\n           the elements of its design, in order to find weaknesses\n  \
    \         and methods of defeating it.\n      Major points were outlined of how\
    \ the virus attacked and who it\n      attacked:\n         How it entered.\n \
    \        Who it attacked.\n         What it attacked.\n         What it did NOT\
    \ do.\n      In Section 2, the target of the attacks by the virus were\n     \
    \ discussed.  This included the sendmail debug mode, the finger\n      daemon\
    \ bug, rexec and passwords, rsh, trusted host features, and\n      information\
    \ flow.  A description of the virus' self protection\n      included how it covered\
    \ its tracks, and what camouflage it used to\n      go undetected to the machines\
    \ and system administrators.  Flaws\n      were analyzed in three subjects: reinfection\
    \ prevention,\n      heuristics, and vulnerabilities not used.\n      Many defenses\
    \ were launched to stop the virus.  Some were\n      convenient or inconvenient\
    \ for end users of the infected systems.\n      Those mentioned in this document\
    \ included:\n         - full isolation from the network\n         - turning off\
    \ mail service\n         - patching out the \"debug\" command in sendmail\n  \
    \       - shutting down the finger daemon\n         - fixing the finger daemon\n\
    \         - mkdir /usr/tmp/sh (a simple way to keep the virus\n           from\
    \ propagating)\n         - defining pleasequit (did not stop the virus)\n    \
    \     - renaming the UNIX C compiler and linker\n         - requiring new passwords\
    \ for all users\n      After the virus was diagnosed, a tool was created which\
    \ duplicated\n      the password attack (including the virus' internal directory)\
    \ and\n      was posted to the Internet.  System administrators were able to\n\
    \      analyze the passwords in use on their system.\n      Section 3 chronicles\
    \ the events that took place between Wednesday,\n      2 November 1988 through\
    \ Friday, 11 November 1988 (EST).  In\n      Section 4, lessons and open issues\
    \ are viewed and discussed:\n         - Connectivity was important.\n        \
    \ - The \"old boy network\" worked.\n         - Late night authentication is an\
    \ interesting problem.\n           (How did you know that it really is MIT on\
    \ the\n           phone??)\n         - Whom do you call (if you need to talk to\
    \ the manager of\n           the Ohio State University network at 3 o'clock in\
    \ the\n           morning)?\n         - Speaker phones and conference calling\
    \ proved very useful.\n         - The \"teams\" that were formed and how they\
    \ reacted to\n           the virus is a topic for future study.\n         - Misinformation\
    \ and illusions ran rampant.\n         - Tools were not as important as one would\
    \ have\n           anticipated.\n         - Source availability was important.\n\
    \         - The academic sites performed the best, better than\n           government\
    \ and commercial sites.\n         - Managing the press was critical.\n      General\
    \ points for the future:\n         - \"We have met the enemy and he is us.\"\n\
    \           (Alleged author of the virus was an insider.)\n         - Diversity\
    \ is good.\n         - \"The cure shouldn't be worse than the disease.\"\n   \
    \        (It may be more expensive to prevent such attacks\n           than is\
    \ is to clean up after them.)\n         - Defenses must be at the host level,\
    \ not the network level.\n           (The network performed its function perfectly\
    \ and should\n           not be faulted; the flaws were in several application\n\
    \           programs.)\n         - Logging information is important.\n       \
    \  - Denial of service attacks are easy.\n         - A central security fix repository\
    \ may be a good idea.\n         - Knee-jerk reactions should be avoided.\n   \
    \   Appendix A describes the virus program subroutine by subroutine.\n      A\
    \ flow of information among the subroutines is pictured on page\n      19.  Appendix\
    \ B presents the 432 words built in the worm's\n      dictionary.  Appendix C\
    \ lists the \"cast of characters\" in\n      defeating the virus.\n   7.3  \"\
    A Tour of the Worm\"\n      In Donn Seeley's \"A Tour of the Worm\", specific\
    \ details were\n      presented as a \"walk thru\" of this particular worm program.\
    \  The\n      paper opened with an abstract, introduction, detailed chronology\n\
    \      of events upon the discovery of the worm, an overview, the\n      internals\
    \ of the worm, personal opinions, and conclusion.\n      The chronology section\
    \ presented a partial list representing the\n      current known dates and times\
    \ (in PST).  In the descriptive\n      overview, the worm is defined as a 99-line\
    \ bootstrap program\n      written in the C language, plus a large relocatable\
    \ object file\n      that was available in VAX and various Sun-3 versions.  Seeley\n\
    \      classified activities of the worm into two categories of attack\n     \
    \ and defense.  Attack consisted of locating hosts (and accounts) to\n      penetrate,\
    \ then exploiting security holes on remote systems to\n      pass across a copy\
    \ of the worm and run it.  The defense tactics\n      fell into three categories:\
    \ preventing the detection of intrusion,\n      inhibiting the analysis of the\
    \ program, and authenticating other\n      worms.  When analyzing this particular\
    \ program, Seeley stated that\n      it is just as important to establish what\
    \ the program DOES NOT do,\n      as what it does do:\n         This worm did\
    \ not delete a system's files,\n         This worm did not modify existing files,\n\
    \         This worm did not install trojan horses,\n         This worm did not\
    \ record or transmit decrypted passwords,\n         This worm did not try to capture\
    \ superuser privileges,\n         This worm did not propagate over UUCP, X.25,\
    \ DECNET, or BITNET,\n         This worm specifically draws upon TCP/IP,\n   \
    \      and\n         This worm did not infect System V systems, unless they had\
    \ been\n         modified to use Berkeley network programs like sendmail,\n  \
    \       fingerd, and rexec.\n      In section 4, the \"internals\" of the worm\
    \ were examined and\n      charted.  The main thread of control in the worm was\
    \ analyzed,\n      then an examination of the worm's data structure was presented.\n\
    \      Population growth of the worm, security holes, the worms' use of\n    \
    \  rsh and rexec network services, the use of the TCP finger service\n      to\
    \ gain entry to a system, and the sendmail attack are discussed.\n      Password\
    \ cracking and faster password encryption algorithms are\n      discussed.\n \
    \     In the opinions section, certain questions that a \"mythical\n      ordinary\
    \ system administrator\" might ask were discussed:\n         Did the worm cause\
    \ damage?\n         Was the worm malicious?\n         Will publication or worm\
    \ details further harm security?\n   7.4  \"The Internet Worm Program: An Analysis\"\
    \n      Gene Spafford's \"The Internet Worm Program: An Analysis\",\n      described\
    \ the infection of the Internet as a worm program that\n      exploited flaws\
    \ in utility programs in UNIX based systems.  His\n      report gives a detailed\
    \ description of the components of the worm\n      program: data and functions.\
    \  He focuses his study on two\n      completely independent reverse-compilations\
    \ of the worm and a\n      version disassembled to VAX assembly language.\n  \
    \    In Section 4, Spafford provided a high-level example of how the\n      worm\
    \ program functioned.  The worm consisted of two parts: a main\n      program,\
    \ and a bootstrap (or vector) program.  A description from\n      the point of\
    \ view of a host that was infected was presented.\n      Section 5 describes the\
    \ data structures and organization of the\n      routines of the program:\n  \
    \       1)  The worm had few global data structures.\n         2)  The worm constructed\
    \ a linked list of host\n             records.\n         3)  The worm constructed\
    \ a simple array of gateway\n             IP addresses through the use of the\
    \ system\n             \"netstat\" command.\n         4)  An array of records\
    \ was filled in with information\n             about each network interface active\
    \ on the current host.\n         5)  A linked list of records was built to hold\
    \ user\n             information.\n         6)  The program maintained an array\
    \ of \"object\" that\n             held the files that composed the worm.\n  \
    \       7)  A mini-dictionary of words was present in the worm\n             to\
    \ use in password guessing.\n         8)  Every text string used by the program,\
    \ except for\n             the words in the mini-dictionary, was masked (XOR)\n\
    \             with the bit pattern 0x81.\n         9)  The worm used the following\
    \ routines:\n              setup and utility:\n                      main, doit,\
    \ crypt, h_addaddr,\n                      h_addname, h_addr2host, h_clean,\n\
    \                      h_name2host, if_init, loadobject,\n                   \
    \   makemagic, netmastfor, permute,\n                      rt_init, supports_rsh,\
    \ and supports_telnet\n              network and password attacks:\n         \
    \             attack_network, attack_user, crack_0,\n                      crack_1,\
    \ crack_2, crack_3, cracksome,\n                      ha, hg, hi, hl, hul, infect,\
    \ scan_gateways,\n                      sendWorm, try_fingerd, try_password,\n\
    \                      try_rsh, try_sendmail, and waithit\n              Camouflage:\n\
    \                      checkother, other_sleep, send_message,\n              \
    \        and xorbuf\n   In Section 6, Spafford provides an analysis of the code\
    \ of the worm.\n   He discusses the structure and style, the problems of functionality,\n\
    \   camouflage, specific comments, the sendmail attack, the machines\n   involved,\
    \ and the portability considerations.\n   Finally, appendices supply the \"mini-dictionary\"\
    \ of words contained\n   in the worm, the bootstrap (vector) program that the\
    \ worm traversed\n   over to each machine, a corrected fingerd program, and the\
    \ patches\n   developed and invoked to sendmail to rectify the infection.\n"
