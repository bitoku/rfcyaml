  - "Abstract\n   The U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration\n\
    \   (NTIA) solicited a request from the Internet Corporation for Assigned\n  \
    \ Names and Numbers (ICANN) to propose how the NTIA should end its\n   oversight\
    \ of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)\n   functions.  After broad\
    \ consultations, ICANN in turn created the IANA\n   Stewardship Transition Coordination\
    \ Group.  That group solicited\n   proposals for the three major IANA functions:\
    \ names, numbers, and\n   protocol parameters.  This document contains the IETF\
    \ response to\n   that solicitation for protocol parameters.  It was included\
    \ in an\n   aggregate response to the NTIA alongside those for names and\n   numbering\
    \ resources that are being developed by their respective\n   operational communities.\
    \  A reference to that response may be found\n   in the introduction, and additional\

  - "1.  IETF Introduction\n   In March of 2014, the U.S. National Telecommunications\
    \ and\n   Information Administration (NTIA) announced its intent to transition\n\
    \   oversight of Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions\n   [NTIA-Announce].\
    \  In that announcement, NTIA asked the Internet\n   Corporation for Assigned\
    \ Names and Numbers (ICANN) to establish a\n   process to deliver a proposal for\
    \ transition.  As part of that\n   process, the IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination\
    \ Group (ICG) was\n   formed.  The charter for the ICG can be found in Appendix\
    \ A.  The ICG\n   in turn solicited proposals regarding post-transition arrangements\n\
    \   from the names, numbers, and protocol parameters communities in order\n  \
    \ to put forth a proposal to the NTIA.  The final request for proposal\n   (RFP)\
    \ can be found in Appendix B.  The response from the ICG to the\n   NTIA may be\
    \ found at [ICG-Response].\n   While there are interactions between all of the\
    \ IANA functions and\n   IETF standards, this document specifically addresses\
    \ the protocol\n   parameters registries function.  Section 1 (this section) contains\
    \ an\n   introduction that is sourced solely within the IETF.  Section 2\n   contains\
    \ the questionnaire that was written by the ICG and a formal\n   response by the\
    \ IETF.  We have quoted questions from that\n   questionnaire with \">>> \", and\
    \ we have prefaced answers to questions\n   being asked with \"IETF Response:\"\
    .  Note that there are small changes\n   to the questions asked in order to match\
    \ the RFC format.\n   We note that the following text was stated as a footnote\
    \ in the\n   original RFP:\n             In this RFP, \"IANA\" refers to the functions\
    \ currently\n         specified in the agreement between NTIA and ICANN\n    \
    \     [http://www.ntia.doc.gov/page/iana-functions-purchase-order] as\n      \
    \   well as any other functions traditionally performed by the IANA\n        \
    \ functions operator. SAC-067\n         [https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/sac-067-en.pdf]\n\
    \         provides one description of the many different meanings of the\n   \
    \      term \"IANA\" and may be useful reading in addition to the\n         documents\
    \ constituting the agreement itself.\n"

    \ of the service or activity.\n   >>>\n   IETF Response:\n   Many IETF protocols\
    \ make use of commonly defined protocol parameters.\n   These parameters are used\
    \ by implementers, who are the primary users\n   of the IETF standards and other\
    \ documents.  To ensure consistent\n   interpretation of these parameter values\
    \ by independent\n   implementations, and to promote universal interoperability,\
    \ these\n   IETF protocol specifications define and require globally available\n\
    \   registries containing the parameter values and a pointer to any\n   associated\
    \ documentation.  The IETF uses the IANA protocol parameters\n   registries to\
    \ store this information in a public location.  The IETF\n   community presently\
    \ accesses the protocol parameter registries via\n   references based on the iana.org\
    \ domain name, and makes use of the\n   term \"IANA\" in the protocol parameter\
    \ registry processes [RFC5226].\n   ICANN currently operates the .ARPA top level\
    \ domain on behalf of the\n   Internet Architecture Board (IAB).  This zone is\
    \ used for certain\n   Internet infrastructure services that are delegated beneath\
    \ it.  The\n   IETF considers .ARPA part of the protocol parameters registries\
    \ for\n   purposes of this response.\n   >>>\n   >>> A description of the customer(s)\
    \ of the service or activity.\n   >>>\n   IETF Response:\n   The IANA protocol\
    \ parameters registries operator maintains the\n   protocol parameters registries\
    \ for the IETF in conformance with all\n   relevant IETF policies, in accordance\
    \ with the Memorandum of\n   Understanding [RFC2860] and associated supplemental\
    \ agreements that\n   include service level agreements (SLAs) established between\
    \ the IETF\n   and ICANN [MOUSUP].\n   The IETF is a global organization that\
    \ produces voluntary standards,\n   whose mission is to produce high quality,\
    \ relevant technical and\n   engineering documents that influence the way people\
    \ design, use, and\n   manage the Internet in such a way as to make the Internet\
    \ work better\n   [RFC3935].  IETF standards are published in the RFC series.\
    \  The IETF\n   is responsible for the key standards that are used on the Internet\n\
    \   today, including IP, TCP, DNS, BGP, and HTTP, to name but a few.\n   The IETF\
    \ operates in an open and transparent manner [RFC6852].  The\n   processes that\
    \ govern the IETF are also published in the RFC series.\n   The Internet Standards\
    \ Process is documented in [RFC2026].  That\n   document explains not only how\
    \ standards are developed, but also how\n   disputes about decisions are resolved.\
    \  RFC 2026 has been amended a\n   number of times [BCP9info].  The standards\
    \ process can be amended in\n   the same manner that standards are approved. \
    \ That is, someone\n   proposes a change by submitting a temporary document known\
    \ as an\n   Internet-Draft, the community discusses it, and if rough consensus\n\
    \   can be found the change is approved by the Internet Engineering\n   Steering\
    \ Group (IESG), who also have day-to-day responsibility for\n   declaring IETF\
    \ consensus on technical decisions, including those that\n   affect the IANA protocol\
    \ parameters registries.  Anyone may propose a\n   change during a Last Call,\
    \ and anyone may participate in the\n   community discussion.\n   >>>\n   >>>\
    \ What registries are involved in providing the service or\n   >>> activity.\n\
    \   >>>\n   IETF Response:\n   The protocol parameters registries are the product\
    \ of IETF work.\n   These also include the top-level registry for the entire IP\
    \ address\n   space and some of its sub-registries, autonomous system number space,\n\
    \   and a number of special use registries with regard to domain names.\n   For\
    \ more detail please refer to the documentation in the \"overlaps or\n   interdependencies\"\
    \ section.\n   Administration of the protocol parameters registries is the service\n\
    \   that is provided to the IETF.\n   >>>\n   >>> A description of any overlaps\
    \ or interdependencies between your\n   >>> IANA requirements and the functions\
    \ required by other customer\n   >>> communities.\n   >>>\n   IETF Response:\n\
    \   In this context, the IETF considers \"overlap\" to be where there is in\n\
    \   some way shared responsibility for a single registry across multiple\n   organizations.\
    \  In this sense, there is no overlap between\n   organizations because responsibility\
    \ for each registry is carefully\n   delineated.  There are, however, points of\
    \ interaction between other\n   organizations, and a few cases where the IETF\
    \ may further define the\n   scope of a registry for technical purposes.  This\
    \ is the case with\n   both names and numbers, as described in the paragraphs\
    \ below.  In all\n   cases, the IETF coordinates with the appropriate organizations.\n\
    \   It is important to note that the IETF does not have formal\n   membership.\
    \  The term \"the IETF\" includes anyone who wishes to\n   participate in the\
    \ IETF, and IETF participants may also be members of\n   other communities.  Staff\
    \ and participants from ICANN and the\n   Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)\
    \ regularly participate in IETF\n   activities.\n   o  The IETF has specified\
    \ a number of special use registries with\n      regard to domain names.  These\
    \ registries require coordination\n      with ICANN as the policy authority for\
    \ the DNS root, including\n      community groups that are responsible for ICANN\
    \ policy on domain\n      names such as the Generic Names Supporting Organization\
    \ (GNSO) and\n      the Country Code Names Supporting Organization (ccNSO).  There\
    \ are\n      already mechanisms in place to perform this coordination, and the\n\
    \      capacity to modify those mechanisms to meet new conditions as they\n  \
    \    might arise.  [RFC6761]\n   o  The IETF specifies the DNS protocol.  From\
    \ time to time there have\n      been and will be updates to that protocol.  As\
    \ we make changes we\n      will broadly consult the operational community about\
    \ the impact of\n      those changes, as we have done in the past.\n   o  The\
    \ IETF specifies minimum requirements for root servers.\n      [RFC2870] Those\
    \ requirements are currently under review, in\n      consultations with the root\
    \ server community.\n   o  The routing architecture has evolved over time, and\
    \ is expected to\n      continue to do so.  Such evolution may have an impact\
    \ on\n      appropriate IP address allocation strategies.  If and when that\n\
    \      happens, the IETF will consult and coordinate with the RIR\n      community,\
    \ as we have done in the past.\n   o  The IETF is responsible for policy relating\
    \ to the entire IP\n      address space and AS number space.  Through the IANA\
    \ protocol\n      parameters registries, the IETF delegates unicast IP address\
    \ and\n      AS number ranges to the RIRs [RFC7020],[RFC7249].  Special address\n\
    \      allocation, such as multicast and anycast addresses, often require\n  \
    \    coordination.  Another example of IP addresses that are not\n      administered\
    \ by the RIR system is Unique Local Addresses (ULAs)\n      [RFC4193], where local\
    \ networks employ a prefix that is not\n      intended to be routed on the public\
    \ Internet.  New special address\n      allocations are added, from time to time,\
    \ related to the evolution\n      of the standards.  In all cases, these special\
    \ assignments are\n      listed in the IANA protocol paramters registries.\n \
    \  o  The IETF maintains sub-registries for special IPv4 and IPv6\n      assignments.\
    \  These are specified in [RFC3307], [RFC5771], and\n      [RFC6890].  The IETF\
    \ coordinates such assignments with the RIRs.\n   o  Changes to IETF standards\
    \ may have impact on operations of RIRs\n      and service providers.  A recent\
    \ example is the extensions to BGP\n      to carry the Autonomous System numbers\
    \ as four-octet entities\n      [RFC6793].  It is important to note that this\
    \ change occurred out\n      of operational necessity, and it demonstrated strong\
    \ alignment\n      between the RIRs and the IETF.\n   >>> II.  Existing, Pre-Transition\

    \   Policy for overall management of the protocol parameters registries\n   is\
    \ stated in [RFC6220] and [RFC5226].  The first of these documents\n   explains\
    \ the model for how the registries are to be operated, how\n   policy is set,\
    \ and how oversight takes place.  RFC 5226 specifies the\n   policies that specification\
    \ writers may employ when they define new\n   protocol registries in the \"IANA\
    \ Considerations\" section of each\n   specification.  All policies at the IETF\
    \ begin with a proposal in the\n   form of an Internet-Draft.  Anyone may submit\
    \ such a proposal.  If\n   there is sufficient interest, a working group whose\
    \ scope includes\n   the proposed work may choose to adopt it, the IESG may choose\

    \ the resulting document is adopted as an supplement to\n   the MoU each year\

    \  Over the years\n   since the creation of ICANN, the IETF, ICANN, and IAB have\
    \ together\n   created a system of agreements, policies, and oversight mechanisms\n\
    \   that already cover what is needed.  This system has worked well\n   without\
    \ any operational involvement from the NTIA.\n   IANA protocol parameters registry\
    \ updates will continue to function\n   day-to-day, as they have been doing for\
    \ the last decade or more.  The\n   IETF community is very satisfied with the\
    \ current arrangement with\n   ICANN.  RFC 2860 remains in force and has served\
    \ the IETF community\n   very well.  RFC 6220 has laid out an appropriate service\
    \ description\n   and requirements.\n   However in the absence of the NTIA contract\
    \ a few new arrangements\n   may be needed in order to ensure the IETF community's\
    \ expectations\n   are met.  Those expectations are the following:\n   o  The\
    \ protocol parameters registries are in the public domain.  It\n      is the preference\
    \ of the IETF community that all relevant parties\n      acknowledge that fact\
    \ as part of the transition.\n   o  It is possible in the future that the operation\
    \ of the protocol\n      parameters registries may be transitioned from ICANN\
    \ to subsequent\n      operator(s).  It is the preference of the IETF community\
    \ that, as\n      part of the NTIA transition, ICANN acknowledge that it will\
    \ carry\n      out the obligations established under C.7.3 and I.61 of the\n \
    \     current IANA functions contract between ICANN and the NTIA\n      [NTIA-Contract]\
    \ to achieve a smooth transition to subsequent\n      operator(s), should the\
    \ need arise.  Furthermore, in the event of\n      a transition it is the expectation\
    \ of the IETF community that\n      ICANN, the IETF, and subsequent operator(s)\
    \ will work together to\n      minimize disruption in the use the protocol parameters\
    \ registries\n      or other resources currently located at iana.org.\n   In developing\
    \ our response we have been mindful of the following\n   points that the IETF\
    \ community has discussed over the last year\n   [ProtoParamEvo14] that have led\
    \ to the following guiding principles\n   for IAB efforts that impact IANA protocol\
    \ parameter registries.\n   These principles must be taken together; their order\
    \ is not\n   significant.\n   1.  The IETF protocol parameters registries function\
    \ has been and\n   continues to be capably provided by the Internet technical\
    \ community.\n   The strength and stability of the function and its foundation\
    \ within\n   the Internet technical community are both important given how\n \
    \  critical protocol parameters are to the proper functioning of IETF\n   protocols.\n\
    \   We think the structures that sustain the protocol parameters\n   registries\
    \ function need to be strong enough that they can be offered\n   independently\
    \ by the Internet technical community, without the need\n   for backing from external\
    \ parties.  And we believe we largely are\n   there already, although the system\
    \ can be strengthened further, and\n   continuous improvements are being made.\n\
    \   2.  The protocol parameters registries function requires openness,\n   transparency,\
    \ and accountability.\n   Existing documentation of how the function is administered\
    \ and\n   overseen is good [RFC2860], [RFC6220].  Further articulation and\n \
    \  clarity may be beneficial.  It is important that the whole Internet\n   community\
    \ can understand how the function works, and that the\n   processes for registering\
    \ parameters and holding those who oversee\n   the protocol parameters function\
    \ accountable for following those\n   processes are understood by all interested\
    \ parties.  We are committed\n   to making improvements here if necessary.\n \
    \  3.  Any contemplated changes to the protocol parameters registries\n   function\
    \ should respect existing Internet community agreements.\n   The protocol parameters\
    \ registries function is working well.  The\n   existing Memorandum of Understanding\
    \ in RFC 2860 defines \"the\n   technical work to be carried out by the Internet\
    \ Assigned Numbers\n   Authority on behalf of the Internet Engineering Task Force\
    \ and the\n   Internet Research Task Force.\"  Any modifications to the protocol\n\
    \   parameters registries function should be made using the IETF process\n   to\
    \ update RFC 6220 and other relevant RFCs.  Put quite simply:\n   evolution, not\
    \ revolution.\n   4.  The Internet architecture requires and receives capable\
    \ service\n   by Internet registries.\n   The stability of the Internet depends\
    \ on capable provision of not\n   just IETF protocol parameters, but IP numbers,\
    \ domain names, and\n   other registries.  Furthermore, DNS and IPv4/IPv6 are\
    \ IETF-defined\n   protocols.  Thus we expect the role of the IETF in standards\n\
    \   development, architectural guidance, and allocation of certain name/\n   number\
    \ parameters to continue.  IP multicast addresses and special-\n   use DNS names\
    \ are two examples where close coordination is needed.\n   The IETF will continue\
    \ to coordinate with ICANN, the RIRs, and other\n   parties that are mutually\
    \ invested in the continued smooth operation\n   of the Internet registries. \
    \ We fully understand the need to work\n   together.\n   5.  The IETF will continue\
    \ management of the protocol parameter\n   registry function as an integral component\
    \ of the IETF standards\n   process and the use of resulting protocols.\n   RFC\
    \ 6220 specifies the role and function of the protocol parameters\n   registry,\
    \ which is critical to IETF standards processes and IETF\n   protocols.  The IAB,\
    \ on behalf of the IETF, has the responsibility to\n   define and manage the relationship\
    \ with the protocol registry\n   operator role.  This responsibility includes\
    \ the selection and\n   management of the protocol parameter registry operator,\
    \ as well as\n   management of the parameter registration process and the guidelines\n\
    \   for parameter allocation.\n   6.  The protocol parameters registries are provided\
    \ as a public\n   service.\n   Directions for the creation of protocol parameters\
    \ registries and the\n   policies for subsequent additions and updates are specified\
    \ in RFCs.\n   The protocol parameters registries are available to everyone, and\n\
    \   they are published in a form that allows their contents to be\n   included\
    \ in other works without further permission.  These works\n   include, but are\
    \ not limited to, implementations of Internet\n   protocols and their associated\
    \ documentation.\n   These principles will guide the IAB, IAOC, and the rest of\
    \ the IETF\n   community as they work with ICANN to establish future IANA\n  \
    \ performance metrics and operational procedures.\n   >>> IV Transition Implications\n\

    \ to establish\n   future IANA performance metrics and operational procedures,\

    \ continuity issues are\n   anticipated, and there are no new technical or operational\
    \ methods\n   proposed by the IETF to test.  The IETF leadership, ICANN, and the\n\
    \   RIRs maintain an ongoing informal dialog to spot any unforeseen\n   issues\
    \ that might arise as a result of other changes.\n   What is necessary as part\

  - "Appendix A.  The Charter of the IANA Stewardship Coordination Group\n       \
    \      (ICG)\n   Charter for the IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group\
    \ V.10\n   (August 27, 2014)\n   The IANA stewardship transition coordination\
    \ group (ICG) has one\n   deliverable: a proposal to the U.S.  Commerce Department\
    \ National\n   Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) regarding\n\
    \   the transition of NTIA's stewardship of the IANA functions to the\n   global\
    \ multi-stakeholder community.  The group will conduct itself\n   transparently,\
    \ consult with a broad range of stakeholders, and ensure\n   that its proposals\
    \ support the security and stability of the IANA\n   functions.\n   The group's\
    \ mission is to coordinate the development of a proposal\n   among the communities\
    \ affected by the IANA functions.  The IANA\n   functions are divided into three\
    \ main categories: domain names,\n   number resources, and other protocol parameters.\
    \  The domain names\n   category falls further into the country code and generic\
    \ domain name\n   sub-categories.  While there is some overlap among all of these\n\
    \   categories, each poses distinct organizational, operational and\n   technical\
    \ issues, and each tends to have distinct communities of\n   interest and expertise.\
    \  For those reasons it is best to have work on\n   the three categories of IANA\
    \ parameters proceed autonomously in\n   parallel and be based in the respective\
    \ communities.\n   The IANA stewardship transition process is taking place alongside\
    \ a\n   parallel and related process on enhancing ICANN accountability.\n   While\
    \ maintaining the accountability of Internet identifier\n   governance is central\
    \ to both processes, this group's scope is\n   focused on the arrangements required\
    \ for the continuance of IANA\n   functions in an accountable and widely accepted\
    \ manner after the\n   expiry of the NTIA-ICANN contract.  Nevertheless, the two\
    \ processes\n   are interrelated and interdependent and should appropriately\n\
    \   coordinate their work.\n   The coordination group has four main tasks:\n \
    \  (i) Act as liaison to all interested parties, including the three\n       \"\
    operational communities\" (i.e., those with direct operational\n       or service\
    \ relationship with IANA; namely names, numbers,\n       protocol parameters).\
    \ This task consists of:\n        a. Soliciting proposals from the operational\
    \ communities\n        b. Soliciting the input of the broad group of communities\n\
    \           affected by the IANA functions\n   (ii) Assess the outputs of the\
    \ three operational communities for\n        compatibility and interoperability\n\
    \   (iii) Assemble a complete proposal for the transition\n   (iv) Information\
    \ sharing and public communication\n   Describing each in more detail:\n     \
    \ (i) Liaison\n        a. Solicit proposals\n   The ICG expects a plan from the\
    \ country code and generic name\n   communities (possibly a joint one), a plan\
    \ from the numbers\n   community, and a plan from the protocol parameters community.\n\
    \   Members of the ICG will ensure that the communities from which they\n   are\
    \ drawn are working on their part of the transition plans.  This\n   involves\
    \ informing them of requirements and schedules, tracking\n   progress, and highlighting\
    \ the results or remaining issues.  The role\n   of a coordination group member\
    \ during this phase is to provide status\n   updates about the progress of his\
    \ or her community in developing\n   their component, and to coordinate which\
    \ community will develop a\n   transition proposal for each area of overlap (e.g.,\
    \ special-use\n   registry).\n   While working on the development of their proposals,\
    \ the operational\n   communities are expected to address common requirements\
    \ and issues\n   relating to the transition, in as far as they affect their parts\
    \ of\n   the stewardship of IANA functions.\n   b.  Solicit broader input\n  \
    \ The ICG is open for input and feedback from all interested parties.\n   While\
    \ no set of formal requirements related to a transition proposal\n   will be requested\
    \ outside the operational communities, everyone's\n   input is welcome across\
    \ all topics.\n   The ICG expects that all interested parties get involved as\
    \ early as\n   possible in the relevant community processes.  Input received\n\
    \   directly by the ICG may be referred to the relevant community\n   discussion.\n\
    \   The ICG members chosen from a particular community are the official\n   communication\
    \ channel between the ICG and that community.\n   (ii) Assessment\n   When the\
    \ group receives output from the communities it will discuss\n   and assess their\
    \ compatibility and interoperability with the\n   proposals of the other communities.\
    \  Each proposal should be\n   submitted with a clear record of how consensus\
    \ has been reached for\n   the proposal in the community, and provide an analysis\
    \ that shows the\n   proposal is in practice workable.  The ICG should also compile\
    \ the\n   input it has received beyond the operational communities, and review\n\
    \   the impacts of this input.\n   The ICG might at some point detect problems\
    \ with the component\n   proposals.  At that point the role of the ICG is to communicate\
    \ that\n   back to the relevant communities so that they (the relevant\n   communities)\
    \ can address the issues.  It is not in the role of the\n   ICG to develop proposals\
    \ or to select from among competing proposals.\n   (iii) Assembling and submitting\
    \ a complete proposal\n   The assembly effort involves taking the proposals for\
    \ the different\n   components and verifying that the whole fulfills the intended\
    \ scope,\n   meets the intended criteria, that there are no missing parts, and\n\
    \   that the whole fits together.  The whole also needs to include\n   sufficient\
    \ independent accountability mechanisms for running the IANA\n   function.  The\
    \ ICG will then develop a draft final proposal that\n   achieves rough consensus\
    \ within the ICG itself.  The ICG will then\n   put this proposal up for public\
    \ comment involving a reasonable period\n   of time for reviewing the draft proposal,\
    \ analyzing and preparing\n   supportive or critical comments.  The ICG will then\
    \ review these\n   comments and determine whether modifications are required.\
    \  If no\n   modifications are needed, and the coordination group agrees, the\n\
    \   proposal will be submitted to NTIA.\n   If changes are required to fix problems\
    \ or to achieve broader\n   support, the ICG will work with the operational communities\
    \ in a\n   manner similar to what was described in task (ii) above.  Updates are\n\
    \   subject to the same verification, review, and consensus processes as\n   the\
    \ initial proposals.  If, in the ICG's opinion, broad public\n   support for the\
    \ proposal as articulated by the NTIA is not present,\n   the parts of the proposal\
    \ that are not supported return to the\n   liaison phase.\n   (iv) Information\
    \ sharing\n   The ICG serves as a central clearinghouse for public information\n\
    \   about the IANA stewardship transition process.  Its secretariat\n   maintains\
    \ an independent, publicly accessible and open website, under\n   its own domain,\
    \ where status updates, meetings and notices are\n   announced, proposals are\
    \ stored, the ICG members are listed, etc.  As\n   the development of the transition\
    \ plans will take some time, it is\n   important that information about ongoing\
    \ work is distributed early\n   and continuously.  This will enable sharing of\
    \ ideas and the\n   detection of potential issues.\n"

    \          Proposals\n   IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group Request\
    \ for Proposals\n   8 September 2014\n   Introduction\n   Under the IANA Stewardship\
    \ Transition Coordination Group (ICG)\n   Charter, the ICG has four main tasks:\n\
    \   (i) Act as liaison to all interested parties in the IANA\n       stewardship\
    \ transition, including the three \"operational\n       communities\" (i.e., those\

    \ proposal for the transition\n   (iv) Information sharing and public communication\n\
    \   This Request for Proposals (RFP) addresses task (i) of the ICG\n   Charter.\
    \ This RFP does not preclude any form of input from the\n   non-operational communities.\n\
    \   0. Complete Formal Responses\n   The IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination\
    \ Group (ICG) seeks\n   complete formal responses to this RFP through processes\
    \ which are to\n   be convened by each of the \"operational communities\" of IANA\
    \ (i.e.,\n   those with direct operational or service relationships with the IANA\n\
    \   functions operator, in connection with names, numbers, or protocol\n   parameters).\n\
    \   Proposals should be supported by the broad range of stakeholders\n   participating\
    \ in the proposal development process. Proposals should\n   be developed through\
    \ a transparent process that is open to and\n   inclusive of all stakeholders\
    \ interested in participating in the\n   development of the proposal. In order\
    \ to help the ICG maintain its\n   light coordination role, all interested and\
    \ affected parties are\n   strongly encouraged to participate directly in these\
    \ community\n   processes.\n   The following link provides information about ongoing\
    \ community\n   processes and how to participate in them, and that will continue\
    \ to\n   be updated over time:\n   https://www.icann.org/en/stewardship/community\n\
    \   In this RFP, \"IANA\" refers to the functions currently specified in\n   the\
    \ agreement between NTIA and ICANN\n   [http://www.ntia.doc.gov/page/iana-functions-purchase-order]\
    \ as well\n   as any other functions traditionally performed by the IANA functions\n\
    \   operator. SAC-067\n   [https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/sac-067-en.pdf]\n\
    \   provides one description of the many different meanings of the term\n   \"\
    IANA\" and may be useful reading in addition to the documents\n   constituting\
    \ the agreement itself.\n   Communities are asked to adhere to open and inclusive\
    \ processes in\n   developing their responses, so that all community members may\
    \ fully\n   participate in and observe those processes. Communities are also\n\
    \   asked to actively seek out and encourage wider participation by any\n   other\
    \ parties with interest in their response.\n   A major challenge of the ICG will\
    \ be to identify and help to\n   reconcile differences between submitted proposals,\
    \ in order to\n   produce a single plan for the transition of IANA\n   stewardship.\
    \ Submitted Proposals should therefore focus on those\n   elements that are considered\
    \ to be truly essential to the transition\n   of their specific IANA functions.\
    \  The target deadline for all\n   complete formal responses to this RFP is 15\
    \ January 2015.\n   I. Comments\n   While the ICG is requesting complete formal\
    \ proposals through\n   processes convened by each of the operational communities,\
    \ and that\n   all interested parties get involved as early as possible in the\n\
    \   relevant community processes, some parties may choose to provide\n   comments\
    \ directly to the ICG about specific aspects of particular\n   proposals, about\
    \ the community processes, or about the ICG's own\n   processes. Comments may\
    \ be directly submitted to the ICG any time\n   via email to icg-forum@icann.org.\
    \ Comments will be publicly archived\n   at <http://forum.icann.org/lists/icg-forum/>.\n\
    \   Commenters should be aware that ICG will direct comments received to\n   the\
    \ relevant operational communities if appropriate. The ICG will\n   review comments\
    \ received as time and resources permit and in\n   accordance with the overall\
    \ timeline for the transition. That is,\n   comments received about specific proposals\
    \ may not be reviewed until\n   those proposals have been submitted to the ICG.\
    \ The ICG may\n   establish defined public comment periods about specific topics\
    \ in\n   the future, after the complete formal responses to the RFP have been\n\
    \   received.\n   Required Proposal Elements\n   The ICG encourages each community\
    \ to submit a single proposal that\n   contains the elements described in this\
    \ section.\n   Communities are requested to describe the elements delineated in\
    \ the\n   sections below in as much detail possible, and according to the\n  \
    \ suggested format/structure, to allow the ICG to more easily\n   assimilate the\
    \ results. While each question is narrowly defined to\n   allow for comparison\
    \ between answers, respondents are encouraged to\n   provide further information\
    \ in explanatory sections, including\n   descriptive summaries of policies/practices\
    \ and associated\n   references to source documents of specific policies/practices.\
    \ In\n   this way, the responses to the questionnaire will be useful at the\n\
    \   operational level as well as to the broader stakeholder communities.\n   In\
    \ the interest of completeness and consistency, proposals should\n   cross-reference\
    \ wherever appropriate the current IANA Functions\n   Contract[3] when describing\
    \ existing arrangements and proposing\n   changes to existing arrangements.\n\
    \   0. Proposal type\n   Identify which category of the IANA functions this submission\n\
    \   proposes to address:\n    [ ] Names [ ] Numbers [ ] Protocol Parameters\n\
    \   I. Description of Community's Use of IANA Functions\n   This section should\
    \ list the specific, distinct IANA functions your\n   community relies on. For\
    \ each IANA function on which your community\n   relies, please provide the following:\n\
    \    o A description of the function;\n    o A description of the customer(s)\
    \ of the function;\n    o What registries are involved in providing the function;\n\
    \    o A description of any overlaps or interdependencies between your\n     \

    \ be followed by the IANA functions operator in its conduct of\n   the services\
    \ or activities described above. If there are distinct\n   sources of policy or\
    \ policy development for different IANA\n   functions, then please describe these\
    \ separately. For each source of\n   policy or policy development, please provide\
    \ the following:\n    o Which IANA function (identified in Section I) are affected.\n\
    \    o A description of how policy is developed and established and who\n    \
    \  is involved in policy development and establishment.\n    o A description of\
    \ how disputes about policy are resolved.\n    o References to documentation of\
    \ policy development and dispute\n      resolution processes.\n   B. Oversight\
    \ and Accountability\n   This section should describe all the ways in which oversight\
    \ is\n   conducted over the IANA functions operator's provision of the\n   services\
    \ and activities listed in Section I and all the ways in\n   which the IANA functions\
    \ operator is currently held accountable for\n   the provision of those services.\
    \ For each oversight or\n   accountability mechanism, please provide as many of\
    \ the following as\n   are applicable:\n   Which IANA functions (identified in\
    \ Section I) are affected.  If the\n   policy sources identified in Section II.A\
    \ are affected, identify\n   which ones are affected and explain in what way.\n\
    \    o A description of the entity or entities that provide oversight or\n   \
    \   perform accountability functions, including how individuals are\n      selected\
    \ or removed from participation in those entities.\n    o A description of the\
    \ mechanism (e.g., contract, reporting scheme,\n      auditing scheme, etc.).\
    \ This should include a description of the\n      consequences of the IANA functions\
    \ operator not meeting the\n      standards established by the mechanism, the\
    \ extent to which the\n      output of the mechanism is transparent and the terms\
    \ under which\n      the mechanism may change.\n    o Jurisdiction(s) in which\
    \ the mechanism applies and the legal basis\n      on which the mechanism rests.\n\
    \   III. Proposed Post-Transition Oversight and Accountability\n        Arrangements\n\
    \   This section should describe what changes your community is\n   proposing\
    \ to the arrangements listed in Section II.B in light of the\n   transition. If\
    \ your community is proposing to replace one or more\n   existing arrangements\
    \ with new arrangements, that replacement should\n   be explained and all of the\
    \ elements listed in Section II.B should\n   be described for the new arrangements.\
    \ Your community should provide\n   its rationale and justification for the new\
    \ arrangements.\n   If your community's proposal carries any implications for\
    \ the\n   interface between the IANA functions and existing policy arrangements\n\
    \   described in Section II.A, those implications should be described\n   here.\n\
    \   If your community is not proposing changes to arrangements listed in\n   Section\
    \ II.B, the rationale and justification for that choice should\n   be provided\
    \ here.\n   IV. Transition Implications\n   This section should describe what\
    \ your community views as the\n   implications of the changes it proposed in Section\
    \ III. These\n   implications may include some or all of the following, or other\n\
    \   implications specific to your community:\n   Description of operational requirements\
    \ to achieve continuity of\n   service and possible new service integration throughout\
    \ the\n   transition.\n   Risks to operational continuity and how they will be\
    \ addressed.\n   Description of any legal framework requirements in the absence\
    \ of the\n   NTIA contract. Description of how you have tested or evaluated the\n\
    \   workability of any new technical or operational methods proposed in\n   this\
    \ document and how they compare to established arrangements.\n   Description of\
    \ how long the proposals in Section III are expected to\n   take to complete,\
    \ and any intermediate milestones that may occur\n   before they are completed.\n\
    \   V. NTIA Requirements\n   Additionally, NTIA has established that the transition\
    \ proposal must\n   meet the following five requirements:\n    o Support and enhance\
    \ the multistakeholder model;\n    o Maintain the security, stability, and resiliency\
    \ of the Internet\n      DNS;\n    o Meet the needs and expectation of the global\
    \ customers and\n      partners of the IANA functions;\n    o Maintain the openness\
    \ of the Internet;\n    o The proposal must not replace the NTIA role with a government-led\n\
    \      or an inter-governmental organization solution.\n   This section should\
    \ explain how your community's proposal meets these\n   requirements and how it\
    \ responds to the global interest in the IANA\n   functions.\n   VI. Community\
    \ Process\n   This section should describe the process your community used for\n\
    \   developing this proposal, including:\n    o The steps that were taken to develop\
    \ the proposal and to determine\n      consensus.\n    o Links to announcements,\
    \ agendas, mailing lists, consultations and\n      meeting proceedings.\n    o\
    \ An assessment of the level of consensus behind your community's\n      proposal,\
    \ including a description of areas of contention or\n      disagreement.\n"

    \ the question that the ICG asked the IETF community\n   on 9 Feb 2015\n   http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ianaplan/current/msg01610.html\n\
    \   > The numbers proposal sees these changes as a requirement of the\n   > transition\

    \ them?\n   We do not observe incompatibilities between the proposals from the\n\
    \   numbers and protocol parameters communities.  The numbers\n   community expresses\
    \ a preference to transfer the trademark and\n   domain, while the IETF proposal\
    \ does not oppose such transfer.\n   This is not an incompatibility, it is something\
    \ that can be\n   satisfied by implementation of both number and protocol\n  \
    \ parameters community's proposals, as already specified.\n   To confirm this,\
    \ and to determine whether the transfer\n   of the trademark and domain would\
    \ be acceptable,\n   we consulted the community.  It is the opinion of the\n \
    \  IANAPLAN working group that they would support a\n   decision by the IETF Trust\
    \ to hold the trademark and domain\n   on behalf of the Internet community.  For\
    \ details, see\n   http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ianaplan/current/msg01659.html\n\
    \   The IETF Trust also looked at this issue.  The trustees decided that\n   the\
    \ IETF Trust would be willing to hold intellectual property rights\n   relating\
    \ to the IANA function, including the IANA trademark and the\n   IANA.ORG domain\
    \ name.  For details, see\n   http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ianaplan/current/msg01664.html\n\
    \   In short, we find no incompatibility between the proposals and no\n   need\
    \ to modify the protocol parameters proposal.\n   Best Regards,\n   Jari Arkko\

    \ Cooper <alissa@cooperw.in>\n   Cc: ICG <internal-cg@ianacg.org>\n   This is\
    \ a response to a query regarding transition finalisation and\n   implementation\
    \ time frames, sent to the IANAPLAN working\n   group list by the chairs of the\
    \ IANA Transition Coordination\n   Group (ICG) on May 27th.\n   While I am carrying\
    \ this response back to the ICG, the substance\n   of this response has been discussed\
    \ in the IANAPLAN working\n   group and the relevant parts of IETF leadership.\
    \  I believe this\n   response represents the (rough) consensus opinion that\n\
    \   emerged in the discussion, as well as the current state\n   of IANA arrangement\
    \ updates that our leadership bodies\n   have been working on.\n   The IETF is\
    \ ready today to take the next steps in the\n   implementation of the transition\
    \ of the stewardship.\n   In our case, most of the necessary framework is already\n\
    \   in place and implemented in preceding years.\n   The remaining step is an\
    \ updated agreement with\n   ICANN which addresses two issues.  These issues are\n\
    \   outlined in Section 2.III in the Internet Draft\n   draft-ietf-ianaplan-icg-response-09.txt:\n\
    \   o The protocol parameters registries are in the public domain.  It\n   is\
    \ the preference of the IETF community that all relevant parties\n   acknowledge\
    \ that fact as part of the transition.\n   o It is possible in the future that\
    \ the operation of the protocol\n   parameters registries may be transitioned\
    \ from ICANN to subsequent\n   operator(s).  It is the preference of the IETF\
    \ community that, as\n   part of the NTIA transition, ICANN acknowledge that it\
    \ will carry\n   out the obligations established under C.7.3 and I.61 of the\n\
    \   current IANA functions contract between ICANN and the NTIA\n   [NTIA-Contract]\
    \ to achieve a smooth transition to subsequent\n   operator(s), should the need\
    \ arise.  Furthermore, in the event of\n   a transition it is the expectation\
    \ of the IETF community that\n   ICANN, the IETF, and subsequent operator(s) will\
    \ work together to\n   minimize disruption in the use of the protocol parameters\
    \ registries\n   or other resources currently located at iana.org.\n   The IETF\
    \ Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) has\n   decided to use an update of\
    \ our yearly IETF-ICANN Service Level\n   Agreement (SLA) as the mechanism for\
    \ this updated\n   agreement.  They have drafted the update and from our\n   perspective\
    \ it could be immediately executed.  Once the updated\n   agreement is in place,\
    \ the transition would be substantially\n   complete, with only the NTIA contract\
    \ lapse or termination\n   as a final step.\n   Of course, we are not alone in\
    \ this process.  Interactions\n   with other parts of the process may bring additional\n\
    \   tasks that need to be executed either before or\n   after the transition.\
    \  First, the ICG, the RIRs,\n   and IETF have discussed the possibility of aligning\n\
    \   the treatment of IANA trademarks and domains.  The\n   IETF Trust has signalled\
    \ that it would be willing to do this,\n   if asked.  We are awaiting coordination\
    \ on this\n   to complete, but see no problem in speedy\n   execution once the\
    \ decision is made.  From our\n   perspective this is not a prerequisite for the\
    \ transition,\n   however.\n   In addition, the names community has proposed the\n\
    \   creation of a 'Post Transition IANA' (PTI).  If the existing\n   agreements\
    \ between the IETF and ICANN remain in place\n   and the SLAs discussed above\
    \ are not affected, the IETF\n   transition would take place as described above.\
    \  That is\n   our preference.  If the final details of the PTI plan require\n\
    \   further action from the IETF, more work and community\n   agreement would\
    \ be required.  The timeline for that work\n   cannot be set until the scope is\
    \ known.\n   Jari Arkko, IETF Chair\n   (reporting his summary of the situation)\n\

    \   The IANAPLAN working group has discussed the coordination\n   question from\

    \   already indicated in the IANAPLAN proposal.  The proposal\n   is a consensus\
    \ document of the IETF.  From the proposal:\n   The IETF will continue to coordinate\
    \ with ICANN, the RIRs, and other\n   parties that are mutually invested in the\
    \ continued smooth operation\n   of the Internet registries.\n   The coordination\
    \ approach is also consistent with the\n   comments that were sent by the IAB\
    \ to the ICG during the\n   public comment period.  See\n   https://www.iab.org/documents/correspondence-reports-documents/2015-\n\
