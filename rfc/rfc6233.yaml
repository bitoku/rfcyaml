  - "Abstract\n   IANA maintains the \"IS-IS TLV Codepoints\" registry.  This registry\n
    \  documents which TLVs can appear in different types of IS-IS Protocol\n   Data
    Units (PDUs), but does not document which TLVs can be found in\n   zero Remaining
    Lifetime Link State PDUs (LSPs), a.k.a. purges.  This\n   document extends the
    existing registry to record the set of TLVs that\n   are permissible in purges
    and updates the rules for generating and\n   processing purges in the presence
    of authentication.  This document\n   updates RFC 3563, RFC 5304, and RFC 5310.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IS-IS [ISO-10589] routing protocol maintains a link
    state\n   database of the topology of its routing domain by flooding a set of\n
    \  Link State Protocol Data Units (LSPs).  When the protocol no longer\n   needs
    the information stored in an LSP, it uses the purge mechanism\n   to cause the
    Intermediate Systems (ISs) in its domain to discard the\n   information contained
    in the LSP.  The process for generating purges\n   can be found in Section 7.3.16.4
    of [ISO-10589].  This process\n   retains only the LSP header, discarding any
    TLVs that had been\n   carried within the LSP.\n   Subsequent enhancements to
    IS-IS, such as [RFC5304] [RFC5310], amend\n   the process of generating a purge
    and allow the inclusion of certain\n   TLVs in purges.\n"

  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Registry Changes\n   This document extends the current \"IS-IS TLV Codepoints\"
    registry,\n   defined in [RFC3563], to record the set of TLVs that MAY be found
    in\n   purges.  All other TLVs MUST NOT appear in purges.  This will serve\n   as
    an aid to subsequent documents, which can then refer to the\n   registry as the
    definitive list of the TLVs allowed in purges.  This\n   will also act as an aid
    to implementers, providing them with an\n   easily accessible compendium of allowable
    TLVs.\n   The purge status defined for a given TLV applies to all sub-TLVs\n   defined
    for that TLV.\n"
  title: 2.  Registry Changes
- contents:
  - "3.  Purges and Authentication\n   Previous documents on authentication [RFC5304]
    [RFC5310] required\n   that an IS only accept a purge if it only contained the\n
    \  Authentication TLV.\n   This document updates and generalizes that behavior
    as follows: an\n   implementation that implements authentication MUST NOT accept
    a purge\n   that contains any TLV listed in the registry that is not acceptable\n
    \  in a purge.  An implementation MUST NOT accept a purge that contains\n   a
    TLV not listed in the registry unless the purge also contains the\n   Purge Originator
    Identification (POI) TLV [RFC6232].  Purges that are\n   accepted MUST be propagated
    without removal of TLVs.  If multiple\n   purges are received for the same LSP,
    then the implementation MAY\n   propagate any one of the purges.\n   If an implementation
    that implements authentication accepts a purge\n   that does not include the POI
    TLV and it chooses to insert the POI\n   TLV, it MUST also recompute authentication.\n
    \  ISs MUST NOT accept LSPs with a non-zero Remaining Lifetime that\n   contain
    the POI TLV.\n   Purge generation is updated as follows: an implementation that\n
    \  implements authentication generates a purge by first removing any\n   TLVs
    that are not listed in the registry as being acceptable in\n   purges.  The POI
    TLV MUST be added.  Then any other TLVs that MAY be\n   in purges, as shown by
    the registry, MAY be added.  Finally,\n   authentication, if any, is added.\n"

  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has modified the \"IS-IS TLV Codepoints\" registry
    by adding a\n   column in the registry for 'Purge'.  A 'y' in this column indicates\n
    \  that the TLV for this row MAY be found in a purge.  An 'n' in this\n   column
    indicates that the TLV for this row MUST NOT be found in a\n   purge.\n   The
    'Purge' column should initially contain a 'y' for TLV type 10\n   (Authentication)
    and for TLV type 137 (Dynamic hostname).  All other\n   entries in this column
    should have an 'n'.  Other additions to this\n   registry should explicitly specify
    their value for this column.\n"
