- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) is the global hierarchical replicated\n\
    \   distributed database system for Internet addressing, mail proxy, and\n   other\
    \ information. The DNS has been extended to include digital\n   signatures and\
    \ cryptographic keys as described in [RFC 2535].  Thus\n   the DNS can now be\
    \ secured and used for secure key distribution.\n   This document describes how\
    \ to store RSA keys and and RSA/MD5 based\n   signatures in the DNS.  Familiarity\
    \ with the RSA algorithm is assumed\n   [Schneier].  Implementation of the RSA\
    \ algorithm in DNS is\n   recommended.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHOULD\", \"RECOMMENDED\", and \"MAY\"\n   in this document are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in RFC 2119.\n"
- title: 2. RSA Public KEY Resource Records
  contents:
  - "2. RSA Public KEY Resource Records\n   RSA public keys are stored in the DNS\
    \ as KEY RRs using algorithm\n   number 1 [RFC 2535].  The structure of the algorithm\
    \ specific portion\n   of the RDATA part of such RRs is as shown below.\n    \
    \       Field             Size\n           -----             ----\n          \
    \ exponent length   1 or 3 octets (see text)\n           exponent          as\
    \ specified by length field\n           modulus           remaining space\n  \
    \ For interoperability, the exponent and modulus are each currently\n   limited\
    \ to 4096 bits in length.  The public key exponent is a\n   variable length unsigned\
    \ integer.  Its length in octets is\n   represented as one octet if it is in the\
    \ range of 1 to 255 and by a\n   zero octet followed by a two octet unsigned length\
    \ if it is longer\n   than 255 bytes.  The public key modulus field is a multiprecision\n\
    \   unsigned integer.  The length of the modulus can be determined from\n   the\
    \ RDLENGTH and the preceding RDATA fields including the exponent.\n   Leading\
    \ zero octets are prohibited in the exponent and modulus.\n"
- title: 3. RSA/MD5 SIG Resource Records
  contents:
  - "3. RSA/MD5 SIG Resource Records\n   The signature portion of the SIG RR RDATA\
    \ area, when using the\n   RSA/MD5 algorithm, is calculated as shown below.  The\
    \ data signed is\n   determined as specified in [RFC 2535].  See [RFC 2535] for\
    \ fields in\n   the SIG RR RDATA which precede the signature itself.\n     hash\
    \ = MD5 ( data )\n     signature = ( 00 | 01 | FF* | 00 | prefix | hash ) ** e\
    \ (mod n)\n   where MD5 is the message digest algorithm documented in [RFC 1321],\n\
    \   \"|\" is concatenation, \"e\" is the private key exponent of the signer,\n\
    \   and \"n\" is the modulus of the signer's public key.  01, FF, and 00\n   are\
    \ fixed octets of the corresponding hexadecimal value. \"prefix\" is\n   the ASN.1\
    \ BER MD5 algorithm designator prefix specified in [RFC\n   2437], that is,\n\
    \      hex 3020300c06082a864886f70d020505000410 [NETSEC].\n   This prefix is included\
    \ to make it easier to use RSAREF (or similar\n   packages such as EuroRef). \
    \ The FF octet MUST be repeated the maximum\n   number of times such that the\
    \ value of the quantity being\n   exponentiated is the same length in octets as\
    \ the value of n.\n   (The above specifications are identical to the corresponding\
    \ part of\n   Public Key Cryptographic Standard #1 [RFC 2437].)\n   The size of\
    \ n, including most and least significant bits (which will\n   be 1) MUST be not\
    \ less than 512 bits and not more than 4096 bits.  n\n   and e SHOULD be chosen\
    \ such that the public exponent is small.\n   Leading zero bytes are permitted\
    \ in the RSA/MD5 algorithm signature.\n   A public exponent of 3 minimizes the\
    \ effort needed to verify a\n   signature.  Use of 3 as the public exponent is\
    \ weak for\n   confidentiality uses since, if the same data can be collected\n\
    \   encrypted under three different keys with an exponent of 3 then,\n   using\
    \ the Chinese Remainder Theorem [NETSEC], the original plain text\n   can be easily\
    \ recovered.  This weakness is not significant for DNS\n   security because we\
    \ seek only authentication, not confidentiality.\n"
- title: 4. Performance Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Performance Considerations\n   General signature generation speeds are roughly\
    \ the same for RSA and\n   DSA [RFC 2536].  With sufficient pre-computation, signature\n\
    \   generation with DSA is faster than RSA.  Key generation is also\n   faster\
    \ for DSA.  However, signature verification is an order of\n   magnitude slower\
    \ with DSA when the RSA public exponent is chosen to\n   be small as is recommended\
    \ for KEY RRs used in domain name system\n   (DNS) data authentication.\n   Current\
    \ DNS implementations are optimized for small transfers,\n   typically less than\
    \ 512 bytes including overhead.  While larger\n   transfers will perform correctly\
    \ and work is underway to make larger\n   transfers more efficient, it is still\
    \ advisable at this time to make\n   reasonable efforts to minimize the size of\
    \ KEY RR sets stored within\n   the DNS consistent with adequate security.  Keep\
    \ in mind that in a\n   secure zone, at least one authenticating SIG RR will also\
    \ be\n   returned.\n"
- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   Many of the general security consideration in\
    \ [RFC 2535] apply.  Keys\n   retrieved from the DNS should not be trusted unless\
    \ (1) they have\n   been securely obtained from a secure resolver or independently\n\
    \   verified by the user and (2) this secure resolver and secure\n   obtainment\
    \ or independent verification conform to security policies\n   acceptable to the\
    \ user.  As with all cryptographic algorithms,\n   evaluating the necessary strength\
    \ of the key is essential and\n   dependent on local policy.\n   For interoperability,\
    \ the RSA key size is limited to 4096 bits.  For\n   particularly critical applications,\
    \ implementors are encouraged to\n   consider the range of available algorithms\
    \ and key sizes.\n"
