    \  content-type that may be used by a message transfer agent (MTA) or\n   electronic
    mail gateway to report the result of an attempt to deliver\n   a message to one

    \ To this end, the protocol described in this memo\n   provides for the carriage
    of \"foreign\" addresses and error codes, in\n   addition to those normally used

  - "1. Introduction\n   This memo defines a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
    (MIME)\n   [MIME1] content-type for Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs).  A DSN\n
    \  can be used to notify the sender of a message of any of several\n   conditions:
    failed delivery, delayed delivery, successful delivery,\n   or the gatewaying
    of a message into an environment that may not\n   support DSNs.  The \"message/delivery-status\"
    content-type defined\n   herein is intended for use within the framework of the\n
    \  \"multipart/report\" content type defined in [REPORT].\n   This memo defines
    only the format of the notifications.  An extension\n   to the Simple Message
    Transfer Protocol (SMTP) [SMTP] to fully\n   support such notifications is the
    subject of a separate memo [DRPT].\n   Document Conventions\n   The key words
    \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document
    are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119\n   [RFC2119].\n"
  title: 1. Introduction
- contents:
  - "1.1 Purposes\n   The DSNs defined in this memo are expected to serve several
    purposes:\n   (a) Inform human beings of the status of message delivery processing,\n
    \      as well as the reasons for any delivery problems or outright\n       failures,
    in a manner that is largely independent of human\n       language and media;\n
    \  (b) Allow mail user agents to keep track of the delivery status of\n       messages
    sent, by associating returned DSNs with earlier message\n       transmissions;\n
    \  (c) Allow mailing list exploders to automatically maintain their\n       subscriber
    lists when delivery attempts repeatedly fail;\n   (d) Convey delivery and non-delivery
    notifications resulting from\n       attempts to deliver messages to \"foreign\"
    mail systems via a\n       gateway;\n   (e) Allow \"foreign\" notifications to
    be tunneled through a MIME-\n       capable message system and back into the original
    messaging\n       system that issued the original notification, or even to a third\n
    \      messaging system;\n   (f) Allow language-independent and medium-independent,
    yet reasonably\n       precise, indications of the reason for the failure of a
    message\n       to be delivered; and\n   (g) Provide sufficient information to
    remote MTA maintainers (via\n       \"trouble tickets\") so that they can understand
    the nature of\n       reported errors.  This feature is used in the case that
    failure\n       to deliver a message is due to the malfunction of a remote MTA\n
    \      and the sender wants to report the problem to the remote MTA\n       administrator.\n"
  title: 1.1 Purposes
- contents:
  - "1.2 Requirements\n   These purposes place the following constraints on the notification\n
    \  protocol:\n   (a) It must be readable by humans as well as being machine-parsable.\n
    \  (b) It must provide enough information to allow message senders (or\n       the
    user agents) to unambiguously associate a DSN with the\n       message that was
    sent and the original recipient address for\n       which the DSN is issued (if
    such information is available), even\n       if the message was forwarded to another
    recipient address.\n   (c) It must be able to preserve the reason for the success
    or failure\n       of a delivery attempt in a remote messaging system, using the\n
    \      \"language\" (mailbox addresses and status codes) of that remote\n       system.\n
    \  (d) It must also be able to describe the reason for the success or\n       failure
    of a delivery attempt, independent of any particular\n       human language or
    of the \"language\" of any particular mail\n       system.\n   (e) It must preserve
    enough information to allow the maintainer of a\n       remote MTA to understand
    (and if possible, reproduce) the\n       conditions that caused a delivery failure
    at that MTA.\n   (f) For any notifications issued by foreign mail systems, which
    are\n       translated by a mail gateway to the DSN format, the DSN must\n       preserve
    the \"type\" of the foreign addresses and error codes, so\n       that these may
    be correctly interpreted by gateways.\n   A DSN contains a set of per-message
    fields that identify the message\n   and the transaction during which the message
    was submitted, along\n   with other fields that apply to all delivery attempts
    described by\n   the DSN.  The DSN also includes a set of per-recipient fields
    to\n   convey the result of the attempt to deliver the message to each of\n   one
    or more recipients.\n"
  title: 1.2 Requirements
- contents:
  - "1.3 Terminology\n   A message may be transmitted through several message transfer
    agents\n   (MTAs) on its way to a recipient.  For a variety of reasons,\n   recipient
    addresses may be rewritten during this process, so each MTA\n   may potentially
    see a different recipient address.  Depending on the\n   purpose for which a DSN
    is used, different formats of a particular\n   recipient address will be needed.\n
    \  Several DSN fields are defined in terms of the view from a particular\n   MTA
    in the transmission.  The MTAs are assigned the following names:\n   (a) Original
    MTA\n       The Original MTA is the one to which the message is submitted for\n
    \      delivery by the sender of the message.\n   (b) Reporting MTA\n       For
    any DSN, the Reporting MTA is the one which is reporting the\n       results of
    delivery attempts described in the DSN.\n       If the delivery attempts described
    occurred in a \"foreign\" (non-\n       Internet) mail system, and the DSN was
    produced by translating\n       the foreign notice into DSN format, the Reporting
    MTA will still\n       identify the \"foreign\" MTA where the delivery attempts
    occurred.\n   (c) Received-From MTA\n       The Received-From MTA is the MTA from
    which the Reporting MTA\n       received the message, and accepted responsibility
    for delivery of\n       the message.\n   (d) Remote MTA\n       If an MTA determines
    that it must relay a message to one or more\n       recipients, but the message
    cannot be transferred to its \"next\n       hop\" MTA, or if the \"next hop\"
    MTA refuses to accept\n       responsibility for delivery of the message to one
    or more of its\n       intended recipients, the relaying MTA may need to issue
    a DSN on\n       behalf of the recipients for whom the message cannot be\n       delivered.
    \ In this case the relaying MTA is the Reporting MTA,\n       and the \"next hop\"
    MTA is known as the Remote MTA.\n   Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between
    the various MTAs.\n"

  - "+-----+      (DSN returned to sender by Reporting MTA)\n     Figure 1. Original,
    Received-From, Reporting and Remote MTAs\n   Each of these MTAs may provide information
    that is useful in a DSN:\n   + Ideally, the DSN will contain the address of each
    recipient as\n     originally specified to the Original MTA by the sender of the\n
    \    message.\n     This version of the address is needed (rather than a forwarding\n
    \    address or some modified version of the original address) so that\n     the
    sender may compare the recipient address in the DSN with the\n     address in
    the sender's records (e.g., an address book for an\n     individual, the list
    of subscribers for a mailing list) and take\n     appropriate action.\n     Similarly,
    the DSN might contain an \"envelope identifier\" that was\n     known to both
    the sender's user agent and the Original MTA at the\n     time of message submission,
    and which, if included in the DSN, can\n     be used by the sender to keep track
    of which messages were or were\n     not delivered.\n   + If a message was (a)
    forwarded to a different address than that\n     specified by the sender, (b)
    gatewayed to a different mail system\n     than that used by the sender, or (c)
    subjected to address rewriting\n     during transmission, the \"final\" form of
    the recipient address\n     (i.e., the one seen by the Reporting MTA) will be
    different than\n     the original (sender-specified) recipient address.  Just
    as the\n     sender's user agent (or the sender) prefers the original recipient\n
    \    address, so the \"final\" address is needed when reporting a problem\n     to
    the postmaster of the site where message delivery failed,\n     because only the
    final recipient address will allow her to\n     reproduce the conditions that
    caused the failure.\n   + A \"failed\" DSN should contain the most accurate explanation
    for the\n     delivery failure that is available.  For ease of interpretation,\n
    \    this information should be a format that is independent of the mail\n     transport
    system that issued the DSN.  However, if a foreign error\n     code is translated
    into some transport-independent format, some\n     information may be lost.  It
    is therefore desirable to provide both\n     a transport-independent status code
    and a mechanism for reporting\n     transport-specific codes.  Depending on the
    circumstances that\n     produced delivery failure, the transport-specific code
    might be\n     obtained from either the Reporting MTA or the Remote MTA.\n   Since
    different values for \"recipient address\" and \"delivery status\n   code\" are
    needed according to the circumstance in which a DSN will be\n   used, and since
    the MTA that issues the DSN cannot anticipate those\n   circumstances, the DSN
    format described here may contain both the\n   original and final forms of a recipient
    address, and both a\n   transport-independent and a transport-specific indication
    of delivery\n   status.\n   Extension fields may also be added by the Reporting
    MTA as needed to\n   provide additional information for use in a trouble ticket
    or to\n   preserve information for tunneling of foreign delivery reports\n   through
    Internet DSNs.\n   The Original, Reporting, and Remote MTAs may exist in very
    different\n   environments and use dissimilar transport protocols, MTA names,\n
    \  address formats, and delivery status codes.  DSNs therefore do not\n   assume
    any particular format for mailbox addresses, MTA names, or\n   transport-specific
    status codes.  Instead, the various DSN fields\n   that carry such quantities
    consist of a \"type\" sub-field followed by\n   a sub-field whose contents are
    ordinary text characters, and the\n   format of which is indicated by the \"type\"
    sub-field.  This allows a\n   DSN to convey these quantities regardless of format.\n"
  title: +-----+      (DSN returned to sender by Reporting MTA)
- contents:
  - "2. Format of a Delivery Status Notification\n   A DSN is a MIME message with
    a top-level content-type of\n   multipart/report (defined in [REPORT]).  When
    a multipart/report\n   content is used to transmit a DSN:\n   (a) The report-type
    parameter of the multipart/report content is\n       \"delivery-status\".\n   (b)
    The first component of the multipart/report contains a human-\n       readable
    explanation of the DSN, as described in [REPORT].\n   (c) The second component
    of the multipart/report is of content-type\n       message/delivery-status, described
    in section 2.1 of this\n       document.\n   (d) If the original message or a
    portion of the message is to be\n       returned to the sender, it appears as
    the third component of the\n       multipart/report.\n   NOTE: For delivery status
    notifications gatewayed from foreign\n   systems, the headers of the original
    message may not be available.\n   In this case the third component of the DSN
    may be omitted, or it may\n   contain \"simulated\" RFC 822 headers that contain
    equivalent\n   information.  In particular, it is very desirable to preserve the\n
    \  subject, date, and message-id (or equivalent) fields from the\n   original
    message.\n   The DSN MUST be addressed (in both the message header and the\n   transport
    envelope) to the return address from the transport envelope\n   which accompanied
    the original message for which the DSN was\n   generated.  (For a message that
    arrived via SMTP, the envelope return\n   address appears in the MAIL FROM command.)\n
    \  The From field of the message header of the DSN SHOULD contain the\n   address
    of a human who is responsible for maintaining the mail system\n   at the Reporting
    MTA site (e.g., Postmaster), so that a reply to the\n   DSN will reach that person.
    \ Exception: if a DSN is translated from a\n   foreign delivery report, and the
    gateway performing the translation\n   cannot determine the appropriate address,
    the From field of the DSN\n   MAY be the address of a human who is responsible
    for maintaining the\n   gateway.\n   The envelope sender address of the DSN SHOULD
    be chosen to ensure\n   that no delivery status reports will be issued in response
    to the DSN\n   itself, and MUST be chosen so that DSNs will not generate mail
    loops.\n   Whenever an SMTP transaction is used to send a DSN, the MAIL FROM\n
    \  command MUST use a NULL return address, i.e., \"MAIL FROM:<>\".\n   A particular
    DSN describes the delivery status for exactly one\n   message.  However, an MTA
    MAY report on the delivery status for\n   several recipients of the same message
    in a single DSN.  Due to the\n   nature of the mail transport system (where responsibility
    for\n   delivery of a message to its recipients may be split among several\n   MTAs,
    and delivery to any particular recipient may be delayed),\n   multiple DSNs may
    still be issued in response to a single message\n   submission.\n"
  title: 2. Format of a Delivery Status Notification
- contents:
  - "2.1 The message/delivery-status content-type\n   The message/delivery-status
    content-type is defined as follows:\n   MIME type name:             message\n
    \  MIME subtype name:          delivery-status\n   Optional parameters:        none\n
    \  Encoding considerations:    \"7bit\" encoding is sufficient and\n                               MUST
    be used to maintain readability\n                               when viewed by
    non-MIME mail readers.\n   Security considerations:    discussed in section 4
    of this memo.\n   The message/delivery-status report type for use in the\n   multipart/report
    is \"delivery-status\".\n   The body of a message/delivery-status consists of
    one or more\n   \"fields\" formatted according to the ABNF of RFC 822 header \"fields\"\n
    \  (see [RFC822]).  The per-message fields appear first, followed by a\n   blank
    line.  Following the per-message fields are one or more groups\n   of per-recipient
    fields.  Each group of per-recipient fields is\n   preceded by a blank line.  Using
    the ABNF of RFC 822, the syntax of\n   the message/delivery-status content is
    as follows:\n           delivery-status-content =  per-message-fields 1*\n                                     (
    CRLF per-recipient-fields )\n   The per-message fields are described in section
    2.2.  The\n   per-recipient fields are described in section 2.3.\n"

- contents:
  - "2.1.1 General conventions for DSN fields\n   Since these fields are defined according
    to the rules of RFC 822, the\n   same conventions for continuation lines and comments

    \  each additional line with a SPACE or HTAB.  Text that appears in\n   parentheses
    is considered a comment and not part of the contents of\n   that notification
    field.  Field names are case-insensitive, so the\n   names of notification fields
    may be spelled in any combination of\n   upper and lower case letters.  Comments
    in DSN fields may use the\n   \"encoded-word\" construct defined in [MIME3].\n"
  title: 2.1.1 General conventions for DSN fields
- contents:
  - "2.1.2 \"*-type\" sub-fields\n   Several DSN fields consist of a \"-type\" sub-field,

    used\n   in the address-type, diagnostic-type, or MTA-name-type sub-field\n   indicates
    the expected format of the address, status-code, or\n   MTA-name which follows.\n
    \  The \"-type\" sub-fields are defined as follows:\n   (a) An \"address-type\"
    specifies the format of a mailbox address.  For\n       example, Internet mail
    addresses use the \"rfc822\" address-type.\n               address-type = atom\n
    \  (b) A \"diagnostic-type\" specifies the format of a status code.  For\n       example,
    when a DSN field contains a reply code reported via the\n       Simple Mail Transfer
    Protocol [SMTP], the \"smtp\" diagnostic-type\n       is used.\n               diagnostic-type

    example, assume that an SMTP client repeatedly\n       tries to relay a message
    to the mail exchanger for a recipient,\n       but fails because a query to a

    \ After a few\n       days, the MTA might abandon its attempt to deliver the message\n

    a \"4\" to indicate \"temporary failure\") would be the same for\n       both
    DSNs.\n       Another example for which the action and status codes may appear\n
    \      contradictory: If an MTA or mail gateway cannot deliver a message\n       because
    doing so would entail conversions resulting in an\n       unacceptable loss of
    information, it would issue a DSN with the\n       'action' field of \"failure\"
    and a status code of 'XXX'.  If the\n       message had instead been relayed,
    but with some loss of\n       information, it might generate a DSN with the same

    be defined in\n   the future by later revisions or extensions to this specification.\n
    \  Extension-field names beginning with \"X-\" will never be defined as\n   standard
    fields;  such names are reserved for experimental use.  DSN\n   field names NOT
    beginning with \"X-\" MUST be registered with the\n   Internet Assigned Numbers
    Authority (IANA) and published in an RFC.\n   Extension DSN fields may be defined
    for the following reasons:\n   (a) To allow additional information from foreign
    delivery status\n       reports to be tunneled through Internet DSNs.  The names
    of such\n       DSN fields should begin with an indication of the foreign\n       environment
    name (e.g., X400-Physical-Forwarding-Address).\n   (b) To allow the transmission
    of diagnostic information which is\n       specific to a particular mail transport
    protocol.  The names of\n       such DSN fields should begin with an indication
    of the mail\n       transport being used (e.g., SMTP-Remote-Recipient-Address).
    \ Such\n       fields should be used for diagnostic purposes only and not by\n
    \      user agents or mail gateways.\n   (c) To allow transmission of diagnostic
    information which is specific\n       to a particular message transfer agent (MTA).
    \ The names of such\n       DSN fields should begin with an indication of the
    MTA\n       implementation that produced the DSN. (e.g., Foomail-Queue-ID).\n
    \  MTA implementers are encouraged to provide adequate information, via\n   extension
    fields if necessary, to allow an MTA maintainer to\n   understand the nature of
    correctable delivery failures and how to fix\n   them.  For example, if message
    delivery attempts are logged, the DSN\n   might include information that allows
    the MTA maintainer to easily\n   find the log entry for a failed delivery attempt.\n
    \  If an MTA developer does not wish to register the meanings of such\n   extension
    fields, \"X-\" fields may be used for this purpose.  To avoid\n   name collisions,
    the name of the MTA implementation should follow the\n   \"X-\", (e.g., \"X-Foomail-Log-ID\").\n"

  - "3. Conformance and Usage Requirements\n   An MTA or gateway conforms to this
    specification if it generates DSNs\n   according to the protocol defined in this
    memo.  For MTAs and\n   gateways that do not support requests for positive delivery\n
    \  notification (such as in [DRPT]), it is sufficient that delivery\n   failure
    reports use this protocol.\n   A minimal implementation of this specification
    need generate only the\n   Reporting-MTA per-message field, and the Final-Recipient,
    Action, and\n   Status fields for each attempt to deliver a message to a recipient\n
    \  described by the DSN.  Generation of the other fields, when\n   appropriate,
    is strongly recommended.\n   MTAs and gateways MUST NOT generate the Original-Recipient
    field of a\n   DSN unless the mail transfer protocol provides the address originally\n
    \  specified by the sender at the time of submission.  (Ordinary SMTP\n   does
    not make that guarantee, but the SMTP extension defined in\n   [DRPT] permits
    such information to be carried in the envelope if it\n   is available.)\n   Each
    sender-specified recipient address SHOULD result in at most one\n   \"delivered\"
    or \"failed\" DSN for that recipient.  If a positive DSN is\n   requested (e.g.,
    one using NOTIFY=SUCCESS in SMTP) for a recipient\n   that is forwarded to multiple
    recipients of an \"alias\" (as defined in\n   [DRPT], section 7.2.7), the forwarding
    MTA SHOULD normally issue a\n   \"expanded\" DSN for the originally-specified
    recipient and not\n   propagate the request for a DSN to the forwarding addresses.\n
    \  Alternatively, the forwarding MTA MAY relay the request for a DSN to\n   exactly
    one of the forwarding addresses and not propagate the request\n   to the others.\n
    \  By contrast, successful submission of a message to a mailing list\n   exploder
    is considered final delivery of the message.  Upon delivery\n   of a message to
    a recipient address corresponding to a mailing list\n   exploder, the Reporting
    MTA SHOULD issue an appropriate DSN exactly\n   as if the recipient address were
    that of an ordinary mailbox.\n       NOTE: This is actually intended to make DSNs
    usable by mailing\n       lists themselves.  Any message sent to a mailing list
    subscriber\n       should have its envelope return address pointing to the list\n
    \      maintainer [see RFC 1123, section 5.3.7(E)].  Since DSNs are sent\n       to
    the envelope return address, all DSNs resulting from delivery\n       to the recipients
    of a mailing list will be sent to the list\n       maintainer.  The list maintainer
    may elect to mechanically\n       process DSNs upon receipt, and thus automatically
    delete invalid\n       addresses from the list. (See section 7 of this memo.)\n
    \  This specification places no restrictions on the processing of DSNs\n   received
    by user agents or distribution lists.\n"

    precautions to minimize the potential damage\n   from denial-of-service attacks.\n

  - "4.2 Confidentiality\n   Another dimension of security is confidentiality.  There
    may be cases\n   in which a message recipient is autoforwarding messages but does
    not\n   wish to divulge the address to which the messages are autoforwarded.\n
    \  The desire for such confidentiality will probably be heightened as\n   \"wireless
    mailboxes\", such as pagers, become more widely used as\n   autoforward addresses.\n
    \  MTA authors are encouraged to provide a mechanism which enables the\n   end
    user to preserve the confidentiality of a forwarding address.\n   Depending on
    the degree of confidentiality required, and the nature\n   of the environment
    to which a message were being forwarded, this\n   might be accomplished by one
    or more of:\n   (a) issuing a \"relayed\" DSN (if a positive DSN was requested)
    when a\n       message is forwarded to a confidential forwarding address, and\n
    \      disabling requests for positive DSNs for the forwarded message,\n   (b)
    declaring the message to be delivered, issuing a \"delivered\" DSN,\n       re-sending
    the message to the confidential forwarding address,\n       and arranging for
    no DSNs to be issued for the re-sent message,\n   (c) omitting \"Remote-*\" or
    extension fields of a DSN whenever they\n       would otherwise contain confidential
    information (such as a\n       confidential forwarding address),\n   (d) for messages
    forwarded to a confidential address, setting the\n       envelope return address
    (e.g., SMTP MAIL FROM address) to the\n       NULL reverse-path (\"<>\") (so that
    no DSNs would be sent from a\n       downstream MTA to the original sender),\n
    \  (e) for messages forwarded to a confidential address, disabling\n       delivery
    notifications for the forwarded message (e.g., if the\n       \"next-hop\" MTA
    uses ESMTP and supports the DSN extension, by\n       using the NOTIFY=NEVER parameter
    to the RCPT command), or\n   (f) when forwarding mail to a confidential address,
    having the\n       forwarding MTA rewrite the envelope return address for the\n
    \      forwarded message and attempt delivery of that message as if the\n       forwarding
    MTA were the originator.  On its receipt of final\n       delivery status, the
    forwarding MTA would issue a DSN to the\n       original sender.\n   In general,
    any optional DSN field may be omitted if the Reporting\n   MTA site determines
    that inclusion of the field would impose too\n   great a compromise of site confidentiality.
    \ The need for such\n   confidentiality must be balanced against the utility of
    the omitted\n   information in trouble reports and DSNs gatewayed to foreign\n
    \  environments.\n   Implementers are cautioned that many existing MTAs will send
    non-\n   delivery notifications to a return address in the message header\n   (rather
    than to the one in the envelope), in violation of SMTP and\n   other protocols.
    \ If a message is forwarded through such an MTA, no\n   reasonable action on the
    part of the forwarding MTA will prevent the\n   downstream MTA from compromising
    the forwarding address.  Likewise,\n   if the recipient's MTA automatically responds
    to messages based on a\n   request in the message header (such as the nonstandard,
    but widely\n   used, Return-Receipt-To extension header), it will also compromise\n
    \  the forwarding address.\n"

    \  even a \"failed\" DSN can not be relied upon as a guarantee that a\n   message
    was not received by the recipient.  Even if DSNs are not\n   actively forged,
    conditions exist under which a message can be\n   delivered despite the fact that
    a failure DSN was issued.\n   For example, a race condition in the SMTP protocol
    allows for the\n   duplication of messages if the connection is dropped following
    a\n   completed DATA command, but before a response is seen by the SMTP\n   client.\n
    \  This will cause the SMTP client to retransmit the message, even\n   though
    the SMTP server has already accepted it [SMTPDUP].  If one of\n   those delivery
    attempts succeeds and the other one fails, a \"failed\"\n   DSN could be issued

    recommendations for the\n   construction of mail gateways that wish to provide
    semi-transparent\n   delivery reports between the Internet and another electronic
    mail\n   system.  Specific DSN gateway requirements for a particular pair of\n
    \  mail systems may be defined by other documents.\n"
  - "Gatewaying from other mail systems to DSNs\n   A mail gateway may issue a DSN
    to convey the contents of a \"foreign\"\n   delivery or non-delivery notification
    over Internet mail.  When there\n   are appropriate mappings from the foreign
    notification elements to\n   DSN fields, the information may be transmitted in
    those DSN fields.\n   Additional information (such as might be useful in a trouble
    ticket\n   or needed to tunnel the foreign notification through the Internet)\n
    \  may be defined in extension DSN fields. (Such fields should be given\n   names
    that identify the foreign mail protocol, e.g., X400-* for X.400\n   NDN or DN
    protocol elements)\n   The gateway must attempt to supply reasonable values for
    the\n   Reporting-MTA, Final-Recipient, Action, and Status fields.  These\n   will
    normally be obtained by translating the values from the remote\n   delivery or
    non-delivery notification into their Internet-style\n   equivalents.  However,
    some loss of information is to be expected.\n   For example, the set of status-codes
    defined for DSNs may not be\n   adequate to fully convey the delivery diagnostic
    code from the\n   foreign system.  The gateway should assign the most precise
    code\n   which describes the failure condition, falling back on \"generic\"\n
    \  codes such as 2.0.0 (success), 4.0.0 (temporary failure), and 5.0.0\n   (permanent
    failure) when necessary.  The actual foreign diagnostic\n   code should be retained
    in the Diagnostic-Code field (with an\n   appropriate diagnostic-type value) for
    use in trouble tickets or\n   tunneling.\n   The sender-specified recipient address,
    and the original envelope-id,\n   if present in the foreign transport envelope,
    should be preserved in\n   the Original-Recipient and Original-Envelope-ID fields.\n
    \  The gateway should also attempt to preserve the \"final\" recipient\n   addresses
    and MTA names from the foreign system.  Whenever possible,\n   foreign protocol
    elements should be encoded as meaningful printable\n   ASCII strings.\n   For
    DSNs produced from foreign delivery or nondelivery notifications,\n   the name
    of the gateway MUST appear in the DSN-Gateway field of the\n   DSN.\n"
  - "Gatewaying from DSNs to other mail systems\n   It may be possible to gateway
    DSNs from the Internet into a foreign\n   mail system.  The primary purpose of
    such gatewaying is to convey\n   delivery status information in a form that is
    usable by the\n   destination system.  A secondary purpose is to allow \"tunneling\"
    of\n   DSNs through foreign mail systems, in case the DSN may be gatewayed\n   back
    into the Internet.\n   In general, the recipient of the DSN (i.e., the sender
    of the\n   original message) will want to know, for each recipient: the closest\n
    \  available approximation to the original recipient address, the\n   delivery
    status (success, failure, or temporary failure), and for\n   failed deliveries,
    a diagnostic code that describes the reason for\n   the failure.\n   If possible,
    the gateway should attempt to preserve the Original-\n   Recipient address and
    Original-Envelope-ID (if present), in the\n   resulting foreign delivery status
    report.\n   When reporting delivery failures, if the diagnostic-type sub-field
    of\n   the Diagnostic-Code field indicates that the original diagnostic code\n
    \  is understood by the destination environment, the information from\n   the
    Diagnostic-Code field should be used.  Failing that, the\n   information in the
    Status field should be mapped into the closest\n   available diagnostic code used
    in the destination environment.\n   If it is possible to tunnel a DSN through
    the destination\n   environment, the gateway specification may define a means
    of\n   preserving the DSN information in the delivery status reports used by\n
    \  that environment.\n"

  - "Appendix C - Guidelines for use of DSNs by mailing list exploders\n   This section
    pertains only to the use of DSNs by \"mailing lists\" as\n   defined in [4], section
    7.2.7.\n   DSNs are designed to be used by mailing list exploders to allow them\n
    \  to detect and automatically delete recipients for whom mail delivery\n   fails
    repeatedly.\n   When forwarding a message to list subscribers, the mailing list\n
    \  exploder should always set the envelope return address (e.g., SMTP\n   MAIL
    FROM address) to point to a special address which is set up to\n   receive non-delivery
    reports.  A \"smart\" mailing list exploder can\n   therefore intercept such non-delivery
    reports, and if they are in the\n   DSN format, automatically examine them to
    determine for which\n   recipients a message delivery failed or was delayed.\n
    \  The Original-Recipient field should be used if available, since it\n   should
    exactly match the subscriber address known to the list.  If\n   the Original-Recipient
    field is not available, the recipient field\n   may resemble the list subscriber
    address.  Often, however, the list\n   subscriber will have forwarded his mail
    to a different address, or\n   the address may be subject to some re-writing,
    so heuristics may be\n   required to successfully match an address from the recipient
    field.\n   Care is needed in this case to minimize the possibility of false\n
    \  matches.\n   The reason for delivery failure can be obtained from the Status
    and\n   Action fields, and from the Diagnostic-Code field (if the status-type\n
    \  is recognized).  Reports for recipients with action values other than\n   \"failed\"
    can generally be ignored; in particular, subscribers should\n   not be removed
    from a list due to \"delayed\" reports.\n   In general, almost any failure status
    code (even a \"permanent\" one)\n   can result from a temporary condition.  It
    is therefore recommended\n   that a list exploder not delete a subscriber based
    on any single\n   failure DSN (regardless of the status code), but only on the\n
    \  persistence of delivery failure over a period of time.\n   However, some kinds
    of failures are less likely than others to have\n   been caused by temporary conditions,
    and some kinds of failures are\n   more likely to be noticed and corrected quickly
    than others.  Once\n   more precise status codes are defined, it may be useful
    to\n   differentiate between the status codes when deciding whether to\n   delete
    a subscriber.  For example, on a list with a high message\n   volume, it might
    be desirable to temporarily suspend delivery to a\n   recipient address which
    causes repeated \"temporary\" failures, rather\n   than simply deleting the recipient.
    \ The duration of the suspension\n   might depend on the type of error.  On the
    other hand, a \"user\n   unknown\" error that persisted for several days could
    be considered a\n   reliable indication that address were no longer valid.\n"

  - "Appendix D - IANA registration forms for DSN types\n   The forms below are for
    use when registering a new address-type,\n   diagnostic-type, or MTA-name-type
    with the Internet Assigned Numbers\n   Authority (IANA).  Each piece of information
    requested by a\n   registration form may be satisfied either by providing the\n
    \  information on the form itself, or by including a reference to a\n   published,
    publicly available specification which includes the\n   necessary information.
    \ IANA MAY reject DSN type registrations\n   because of incomplete registration
    forms, imprecise specifications,\n   or inappropriate type names.\n   To register
    a DSN type, complete the applicable form below and send\n   it via Internet electronic
    mail to <IANA@IANA.ORG>.\n"
  - "IANA registration form for address-type\n   A registration for a DSN address-type
    MUST include the following\n   information:\n   (a) The proposed address-type

    \      BNF, regular expressions, ASN.1, or other non-ambiguous language.\n   (c)
    If addresses of this type are not composed entirely of graphic\n       characters

    to\n       be translated to and from Internet electronic mail addresses.\n"
  - "IANA registration form for diagnostic-type\n   A registration for a DSN address-type
    MUST include the following\n   information:\n   (a) The proposed diagnostic-type
    name.\n   (b) A description of the syntax to be used for expressing diagnostic\n
    \      codes of this type as graphic characters from the US-ASCII\n       repertoire.\n
    \  (c) A list of valid diagnostic codes of this type and the meaning of\n       each
