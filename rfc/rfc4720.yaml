  - "1.  Overview\n   The specifications for Ethernet, Frame Relay, HDLC, and PPP\n\
    \   pseudowire encapsulation [1] [2] [3] [9] [10] [11] include a mode of\n   use\
    \ whereby frames are transparently delivered across the pseudowire\n   without\
    \ any header or other alterations by the pseudowire ingress or\n   egress Provider\
    \ Edge (PE). (Note that this mode is inherent for HDLC\n   and PPP Pseudowires.)\n\
    \   However, these specifications all specify that the original Frame\n   Check\
    \ Sequence (FCS) be removed at ingress and regenerated at egress,\n   which means\
    \ that the frames may be subject to unintentional\n   alteration during their\
    \ traversal of the pseudowire from the ingress\n   to the egress PE.  Thus, the\
    \ pseudowire cannot absolutely be\n   guaranteed to be \"transparent\" in nature.\n\
    \   To be more precise, pseudowires, as currently defined, leave the\n   payload\
    \ vulnerable to unintended modification occurring while\n   transiting the encapsulating\
    \ network.  Not only can a PW-aware device\n   internally corrupt an encapsulated\
    \ payload, but ANY LSR or router in\n   the path can corrupt the encapsulated\
    \ payload.  In the event of such\n   corruption, there is no way to detect the\
    \ corruption through the path\n   of the pseudowire.  Further, because the FCS\
    \ is calculated upon\n   network egress, any corruption will pass transparently\
    \ through ALL\n   Layer 2 switches (Ethernet and Frame Relay) through which the\
    \ packets\n   travel.  Only at the endpoint, assuming that the corrupted packet\n\
    \   even reaches the correct endpoint, can the packet be discarded, and\n   depending\
    \ on the contents of the packet, the corruption may not ever\n   be detected.\n\
    \   Not only does the encapsulation technique leave the payload\n   unprotected,\
    \ it also subverts the error checking mechanisms already\n   in place in SP and\
    \ customer networks by calculating FCS on\n   questionable data.\n   In a perfect\
    \ network comprising perfect equipment, this is not an\n   issue.  However, as\
    \ there is no such thing, it is an issue.  SPs\n   should have the option of saving\
    \ overhead by yielding the ability to\n   detect faults.  Equally, SPs should\
    \ have the option to sacrifice the\n   overhead of carrying the original FCS end-to-end\
    \ to ensure the\n   ability to detect faults in the encapsulating network.\n \
    \  This document defines such a mechanism to allow the ingress PE to\n   retain\
    \ the original frame FCS on ingress to the network, and it\n   relieves the egress\
    \ PE of the task of regenerating the FCS.\n   This is an OPTIONAL mechanism for\
    \ pseudowire implementations.  For\n   interoperability with systems that do not\
    \ implement this document,\n   the default behavior is that the FCS is removed\
    \ at the ingress PE and\n   regenerated at the egress PE, as specified in [1],\
    \ [2], and [3].\n   This capability may be used only with Ethernet pseudowires\
    \ that use\n   \"raw mode\" [1], Frame Relay pseudowires that use \"port mode\"\
    \ [2] [3],\n   and HDLC and PPP pseudowires [3].\n   Note that this mechanism\
    \ is not intended to carry errored frames\n   through the pseudowire; as usual,\
    \ the FCS MUST be examined at the\n   ingress PE, and errored frames MUST be discarded.\
    \  The FCS MAY also\n   be examined by the egress PE; if this is done, errored\
    \ frames MUST be\n   discarded.  The egress PE MAY also wish to generate an alarm\
    \ or count\n   the number of errored frames.\n"

- title: 3.  Signaling FCS Retention with MPLS-Based Pseudowires
  contents:
  - "3.  Signaling FCS Retention with MPLS-Based Pseudowires\n   When using the signaling\
    \ procedures in [4], there is a Pseudowire\n   Interface Parameter Sub-TLV type\
    \ used to signal the desire to retain\n   the FCS when advertising a VC label\
    \ [5]:\n      Parameter      Length    Description\n           0x0A          \
    \ 4    FCS Retention Indicator\n   The presence of this parameter indicates that\
    \ the egress PE requests\n   that the ingress PE retain the FCS for the VC label\
    \ being advertised.\n   It does not obligate the ingress PE to retain the FCS;\
    \ it is simply\n   an indication that the ingress PE MAY retain the FCS.  The\
    \ sender\n   MUST NOT retain the FCS if this parameter is not present in the VC\n\
    \   FEC element.\n   The parameter includes a 16-bit FCS length field, which indicates\
    \ the\n   length of the original FCS being retained.  For Ethernet pseudowires,\n\
    \   this length will always be set to 4.  For HDLC, PPP, and Frame Relay\n   pseudowires,\
    \ this length will be set to either 2 or 4.  Since the FCS\n   length on these\
    \ interfaces is a local setting, retaining the FCS only\n   makes sense if the\
    \ FCS length is identical on both ends of the\n   pseudowire.  Including the FCS\
    \ length in this parameter allows the\n   PEs to ensure that the FCS is only retained\
    \ when it makes sense.\n   Since unknown parameters are silently ignored [4],\
    \ backward\n   compatibility with systems that do not implement this document\
    \ is\n   provided by requiring that the FCS be retained ONLY if the FCS\n   Retention\
    \ Indicator with an identical setting for the FCS length has\n   been included\
    \ in the advertisements for both directions on a\n   pseudowire.\n   If the ingress\
    \ PE recognizes the FCS Retention Indicator parameter\n   but does not wish to\
    \ retain the FCS with the indicated length, it\n   need only issue its own label\
    \ mapping message for the opposite\n   direction without including the FCS Retention\
    \ Indicator.  This will\n   prevent FCS retention in either direction.\n   If\
    \ PWE3 signaling [4] is not in use for a pseudowire, then whether\n   the FCS\
    \ is to be retained MUST be identically provisioned in both PEs\n   at the pseudowire\
    \ endpoints.  If there is no provisioning support for\n   this option, the default\
    \ behavior is to remove the FCS.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Signaling FCS Retention with L2TPv3-Based Pseudowires\n   This section uses\
    \ the following terms as defined in [7]:\n      Incoming-Call-Request (ICRQ)\n\
    \      Incoming-Call-Reply (ICRP)\n      Incoming-Call-Connected (ICCN)\n    \
    \  Attribute Value Pair (AVP)\n      L2TP Control Connection Endpoint (LCCE)\n\
    \   When using the signaling procedures in [7], the FCS Retention AVP,\n   Attribute\
    \ Type 92, is used.\n   The Attribute Value field for this AVP has the following\
    \ format:\n       0                   1\n       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4\
    \ 5\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n      |          FCS Length    \
    \       |\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n   The FCS Length is a 2-octet\
    \ unsigned integer.\n   The presence of this AVP in an ICRQ or ICRP message indicates\
    \ that an\n   LCCE (PE) requests that its peer retain FCS for the L2TP session\n\
    \   being established.  If the receiving LCCE recognizes the AVP and\n   complies\
    \ with the FCS retention request, it MUST include an FCS\n   Retention AVP as\
    \ an acknowledgement in a corresponding ICRP or ICCN\n   message.  FCS Retention\
    \ is always bidirectional; thus, FCS is only\n   retained if both LCCEs send an\
    \ FCS Retention AVP during session\n   establishment.\n   The Attribute Value\
    \ is a 16-bit FCS length field, which indicates the\n   length of the original\
    \ FCS being retained.  For Ethernet pseudowires,\n   this length will always be\
    \ set to 4.  For HDLC, PPP, and Frame Relay\n   pseudowires, this length will\
    \ be set to either 2 or 4.  Since the FCS\n   length on these interfaces is a\
    \ local setting, retaining the FCS only\n   makes sense if the FCS length is identical\
    \ on both ends of the\n   pseudowire.  Including the FCS length in this AVP allows\
    \ the PEs to\n   ensure that the FCS is only retained when doing so makes sense.\n\
    \   The Length of this AVP is 8.  The M bit for this AVP MUST be set to 0\n  \
    \ (zero).  This AVP MAY be hidden (the H bit MAY be 1 or 0).\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This mechanism enhances the data integrity of\
    \ transparent Ethernet,\n   Frame Relay, and HDLC pseudowires, because the original\
    \ FCS, as\n   generated by the Customer Edge (CE), is included in the\n   encapsulation.\
    \  When the encapsulated payload passes FCS checking at\n   the destination CE,\
    \ it is clear that the payload was not altered\n   during its transmission through\
    \ the network (or at least to the\n   accuracy of the original FCS; but that is\
    \ demonstrably better than no\n   FCS at all).\n   Of course, nothing comes for\
    \ free; this requires the additional\n   overhead of carrying the original FCS\
    \ (in general, either two or four\n   octets per payload packet).\n   This signaling\
    \ is backward compatible and interoperable with systems\n   that do not implement\
    \ this document.\n"
- title: 6.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "6.  Applicability Statement\n   In general, this document is intended to further\
    \ extend the\n   applicability of the services defined by [1], [2], and [3] to\
    \ make\n   them more suitable for use in deployments where data integrity is an\n\
    \   issue (or at least is as much of an issue as in the original services\n  \
    \ that defined the FCS usage in the first place).  There are some\n   situations\
    \ where this extension is not necessary, such as where the\n   inner payloads\
    \ have their own error-checking capabilities (such as\n   TCP).  But for inner\
    \ payloads that do rely on the error-detecting\n   capabilities of the link layer\
    \ (such as SNA), this additional\n   protection can be invaluable.\n   When pseudowires\
    \ are being used to connect 802.1 bridges, this\n   document allows pseudowires\
    \ to comply with the requirement that all\n   media interconnecting 802.1 bridges\
    \ have (at least) 32-bit FCS\n   protection.\n   Note that this document is one\
    \ possible alternative for a service\n   provider to enhance the end-to-end data\
    \ integrity of pseudowires.\n   Other mechanisms may include the use of end-to-end\
    \ IPsec between the\n   PEs, or internal mechanisms in the P routers to ensure\
    \ the integrity\n   of packets as they are switched between ingress and egress\n\
    \   interfaces.  Service providers may wish to compare the relative\n   strengths\
    \ of each approach when planning their pseudowire\n   deployments; however, an\
    \ argument can be made that it may be wasteful\n   for an SP to use an end-to-end\
    \ integrity mechanism that is STRONGER\n   than the FCS generated by the source\
    \ CE and checked by the\n   destination CE.\n"

    \ IANA assigned one value within the L2TP \"Control Message Attribute\n   Value\
    \ Pairs\" section as per [8].  The new AVP is 92 and is referred\n   to in the\
    \ IANA L2TP parameters registry as \"FCS Retention\".\n"
