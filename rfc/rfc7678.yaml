  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, customer equipment may\
    \ have\n   to support one of the various transition methods that have been\n \
    \  defined for carrying IPv4 packets over IPv6.  This document\n   enumerates\
    \ the information that needs to be provisioned on a customer\n   edge router to\
    \ support a list of transition techniques based on\n   tunneling IPv4 in IPv6,\
    \ with a view to defining reusable components\n   for a reasonable transition\
    \ path between these techniques.  To the\n   extent that the provisioning is done\
    \ dynamically, Authentication,\n   Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) support\
    \ is needed to provide the\n   information to the network server responsible for\
    \ passing the\n   information to the customer equipment.  This document specifies\n\
    \   Diameter (RFC 6733) Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs) to be used for that\n   purpose.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   A number of transition techniques have been defined to allow\
    \ IPv4\n   packets to pass between hosts and IPv4 networks over an intervening\n\
    \   IPv6 network while minimizing the number of public IPv4 addresses\n   that\
    \ need to be consumed by the hosts.  Different operators will\n   deploy different\
    \ technologies, and sometimes one operator will use\n   more than one technology\
    \ depending on what is supported by the\n   available equipment and upon other\
    \ factors both technical and\n   economic.\n   Each technique requires the provisioning\
    \ of some subscriber-specific\n   information on the customer edge device.  The\
    \ provisioning may be by\n   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] or by some other method.  This document\
    \ is\n   indifferent to the specific provisioning technique used but assumes a\n\
    \   deployment in which that information is managed by AAA\n   (Authentication,\
    \ Authorization, and Accounting) servers.  It further\n   assumes that this information\
    \ is delivered to intermediate network\n   nodes for onward provisioning using\
    \ the Diameter protocol [RFC6733].\n   As described below, in the particular case\
    \ where the Lightweight\n   4over6 (lw4o6) [RFC7596] transition method has been\
    \ deployed, per-\n   subscriber-site information almost identical to that passed\
    \ to the\n   subscriber site [RFC7598] also needs to be delivered to the border\n\
    \   router serving that site.  The Diameter protocol may be used for this\n  \
    \ purpose too.\n   This document analyzes the information required to configure\
    \ the\n   customer edge equipment for the following set of transition methods:\n\
    \   o  Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite) [RFC6333],\n   o  Lightweight 4over6 (lw4o6)\
    \ [RFC7596], and\n   o  Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E)\
    \ [RFC7597].\n   [DSLITE-MULTICAST] specifies a generic solution for delivery\
    \ of IPv4\n   multicast services to IPv4 clients over an IPv6 multicast network.\n\
    \   The solution was developed with DS-Lite in mind but it is not limited\n  \
    \ to DS-Lite.  As such, it applies also for lw4o6 and MAP-E.  This\n   document\
    \ analyzes the information required to configure the customer\n   edge equipment\
    \ for the support of multicast in the context of DS-\n   Lite, MAP-E, and lw4o6\
    \ in particular.\n   On the basis of those analyses, it specifies a number of\
    \ Attribute-\n   Value Pairs (AVPs) to allow the necessary subscriber-site-specific\n\
    \   configuration information to be carried in Diameter.\n   This document doesn't\
    \ specify any new commands or Application IDs.\n   The specified AVPs could be\
    \ used for any Diameter application\n   suitable for provisioning.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Requirements Language
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n   The abbreviation CPE stands for Customer Premise Equipment.\
    \  It\n   denotes the equipment at the customer edge that terminates the\n   customer\
    \ end of an IPv6 transitional tunnel.  This will usually be a\n   router but could\
    \ be a host directly connected to the network.  In\n   some documents (e.g., [RFC7597]),\
    \ this functional entity is called CE\n   (Customer Edge).\n   The term \"tunnel\
    \ source address\" is used to denote the IPv6 source\n   address used in the outer\
    \ header of packets sent from the CPE through\n   an lw4o6 transitional tunnel\
    \ to the border router.\n"
- title: 2.  Description of the Parameters Required by Each Transition Method
  contents:
  - "2.  Description of the Parameters Required by Each Transition Method\n   This\
    \ section reviews the parameters that need to be provisioned for\n   each of the\
    \ transition methods listed above.  This enumeration\n   provides the justification\
    \ for the AVPs defined in the next section.\n   A means is required to indicate\
    \ which transition method(s) a given\n   subscriber wants to use.  The approach\
    \ taken in this document is to\n   specify Grouped AVPs specific to lw4o6 and\
    \ MAP-E.  The operator can\n   control which of these two transition methods a\
    \ given subscriber uses\n   by ensuring that AAA passes only the Grouped AVP relevant\
    \ to that\n   method.  A Grouped AVP is unnecessary for DS-Lite since AAA has\
    \ only\n   to provide the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the DS-Lite\n\
    \   Address Family Transition Router (AFTR) (see Section 2.1).  Hence,\n   when\
    \ no Grouped AVP is provided either for lw4o6 or MAP-E and only\n   the AFTR's\
    \ FQDN is present, this indicates that the subscriber\n   equipment will use the\
    \ DS-Lite transition method.  Provisioning of\n   multicast is an orthogonal activity\
    \ since it is independent of the\n   transition method.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Parameters for Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite)
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Parameters for Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite)\n   DS-Lite is documented in [RFC6333].\
    \  The Basic Bridging BroadBand\n   (B4) element at the customer premises needs\
    \ to discover the IPv6\n   address of the AFTR (border router).  For the reasons\
    \ discussed in\n   Section 3.2, the AAA server provisions the B4 element with\
    \ the AFTR's\n   FQDN that is passed to a B4's IP resolution library.  The AFTR's\
    \ FQDN\n   is contained in the Border-Router-Name AVP (see Section 3.2).\n   The\
    \ B4 element could also be configured with the IPv4 address of the\n   B4 interface\
    \ facing the tunnel, with valid values from 192.0.0.2 to\n   192.0.0.7 and the\
    \ default value of 192.0.0.2 in the absence of\n   provisioning.  Provisioning\
    \ such information through AAA is\n   problematic because it is most likely used\
    \ in a case where multiple\n   B4 instances occupy the same device.  This document\
    \ therefore assumes\n   that the B4 interface address is determined by other means\
    \ than AAA\n   (implementation dependent or static assignment).\n"
- title: 2.2.  Lightweight 4over6 (lw4o6)
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Lightweight 4over6 (lw4o6)\n   Lightweight 4over6 (lw4o6) is documented\
    \ in [RFC7596].  Lw4o6\n   requires four items to be provisioned to the customer\
    \ equipment:\n   o  an IPv6 address of the border router.\n   o  an IPv6 prefix\
    \ used by the CPE to construct the tunnel source\n      address.  In the terminology\
    \ of [RFC7596], this is the IPv6\n      Binding Prefix.\n   o  an IPv4 address\
    \ to be used on the external side of the CPE.\n   o  if the IPv4 address is shared,\
    \ a specification of the port set the\n      subscriber site is allowed to use.\
    \  Please see the description in\n      Section 2.3.  For lw4o6, all three of\
    \ the parameters 'a', 'k', and\n      the Port Set Identifier (PSID) described\
    \ in that section are\n      required.  The default value of the offset parameter\
    \ 'a' is 0.\n   As discussed in Section 4 of [RFC7596], it is necessary to\n \
    \  synchronize this configuration with corresponding per-subscriber\n   configuration\
    \ at the border router.  The border router information\n   consists of the same\
    \ public IPv4 address and port set parameters that\n   are passed to the CPE,\
    \ bound together with the full /128 IPv6 address\n   (not just the Binding Prefix)\
    \ configured as the tunnel source address\n   at the CPE.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Port Set Specification
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Port Set Specification\n   When an external IPv4 address is shared, lw4o6\
    \ and MAP-E restrict the\n   CPE to use of a subset of all available ports on\
    \ the external side.\n   Both transition methods use the algorithm defined in\
    \ Appendix B of\n   [RFC7597] to derive the values of the port numbers in the\
    \ port set.\n   This algorithm features three parameters, describing the positioning\n\
    \   and value of the PSID within each port number of the generated set:\n   o\
    \  an offset 'a' from the beginning of the port number to the first\n      bit\
    \ of the PSID;\n   o  the length 'k' of the PSID within the port number, in bits;\
    \ and\n   o  the value of the PSID itself.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E)
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E)\n   Mapping of Address\
    \ and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E) is described\n   in [RFC7597].  MAP-E requires\
    \ the provisioning of the following per-\n   subscriber information at the customer\
    \ edge device:\n   o  the IPv6 address of one or more border routers, or in MAP-E\n\
    \      terminology, MAP-E border relays.\n   o  the unique end-user IPv6 prefix\
    \ for the customer edge device.\n      This may be provided by AAA or acquired\
    \ by other means.\n   o  the Basic Mapping Rule for the customer edge device.\
    \  This\n      includes the following parameters:\n      *  the Rule IPv6 prefix\
    \ and length.\n      *  the Rule IPv4 prefix and length.  A prefix length of 0\n\
    \         indicates that the entire IPv4 address or prefix is coded in\n     \
    \    the Extended Address (EA) bits of the end-user IPv6 prefix\n         rather\
    \ than in the mapping rule.\n      *  the number of EA bits included in the end-user\
    \ IPv6 prefix.\n      *  port set parameters giving the set of ports the CPE is\
    \ allowed\n         to use when the IPv4 address is shared.  Please see the\n\
    \         description of these parameters in Section 2.3.  At a minimum,\n   \
    \      the offset parameter 'a' is required.  For MAP-E, this has the\n      \
    \   default value 6.  The parameters 'k' and PSID are needed if\n         they\
    \ cannot be derived from the mapping rule information and\n         the EA bits\
    \ (final case of Section 5.2 of [RFC7597]).\n   o  whether the device is to operate\
    \ in Mesh or Hub-and-Spoke mode.\n   o  in mesh mode only, zero or more Forwarding\
    \ Mapping Rules described\n      by the same set of parameters as the Basic Mapping\
    \ Rule.\n   As indicated in the first bullet in Section 5 of [RFC7597], a MAP\
    \ CPE\n   can be provisioned with multiple end-user IPv6 prefixes, each\n   associated\
    \ with its own Basic Mapping Rule.  This does not change the\n   basic requirement\
    \ for representation of the corresponding information\n   in the form of Diameter\
    \ AVPs, but adds a potential requirement for\n   multiple instances of this information\
    \ to be present in the Diameter\n   message, differing in the value of the end-user\
    \ IPv6 prefix (in\n   contrast to the Forward Mapping Rule instances).\n   The\
    \ border router needs to be configured with the superset of the\n   Mapping Rules\
    \ passed to the customer sites it serves.  Since this\n   requirement does not\
    \ require direct coordination with CPE\n   configuration in the way lw4o6 does,\
    \ it is out of scope of the\n   present document.  However, the AVPs defined here\
    \ may be useful if a\n   separate Diameter application is used to configure the\
    \ border router.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Parameters for Multicast

  - "2.5.  Parameters for Multicast\n   [DSLITE-MULTICAST] specifies a generic solution\

    \ but\n   is also adaptable to lw4o6 and MAP-E.  For example, [PREFIX-OPTION]\n\
    \   specifies how DHCPv6 [RFC3315] can be used to provision multicast-\n   related\
    \ information.  The following lists the multicast-related\n   information that\
    \ needs to be provisioned:\n   o  ASM-mPrefix64: the IPv6 multicast prefix to\
    \ be used to synthesize\n      the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses of the multicast\
    \ groups in the\n      Any-Source Multicast (ASM) mode.  This is achieved by\n\

    \ used to synthesize\n      the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses of the multicast\
    \ groups in the\n      Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) [RFC4607] mode.  This is\

    \ to be used in SSM mode for\n      constructing the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses\
    \ representing the\n      IPv4 multicast sources in the IPv6 domain. uPrefix64\

  contents:
  - "6.1.  Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) Attacks\n   The AVPs defined in this document\
    \ face two threats, both dependent on\n   man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on\
    \ the Diameter delivery path.\n   The first threat is denial-of-service (DoS)\
    \ through modification of\n   the AVP contents leading to misconfiguration; e.g.,\
    \ a subscriber may\n   fail to access its connectivity service if an invalid IP\
    \ address was\n   configured, the subscriber's traffic can be intercepted by a\n\
    \   misbehaving node if a fake Border Node has been configured, etc.\n   The second\
    \ threat is that Diameter security is currently provided on\n   a hop-by-hop basis\
    \ (see Section 2.2 of [RFC6733]).  At the time of\n   writing, the Diameter end-to-end\
    \ security problem has not been\n   solved, so MITM attacks by Diameter peers\
    \ along the path are\n   possible.  Diameter-related security considerations are\
    \ discussed in\n   Section 13 of [RFC6733].\n"

    \   information (e.g., subscriber addresses) that can be used for\n   tracking\
    \ proposes, all these AVPs are considered to be security\n   sensitive.  Therefore,\
    \ the considerations discussed in Section 13.3\n   of [RFC6733] MUST be followed\
    \ for Diameter messages containing these\n   AVPs.\n"
