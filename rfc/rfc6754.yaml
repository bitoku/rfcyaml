  - "1.  Introduction\n   A PIM router uses the RPF procedure to select an upstream
    interface\n   and a PIM neighbor on that interface to build forwarding state.
    \ When\n   there are equal-cost multipaths (ECMPs) upstream, existing\n   implementations
    often use hash algorithms to select a path.  Such\n   algorithms do not allow
    the spread of traffic among the ECMP\n   according to administrative metrics.
    \ This usually leads to\n   inefficient or ineffective use of network resources.
    \ This document\n   introduces the ECMP Redirect, a mechanism to improve the RPF\n
    \  procedure over ECMP.  It allows ECMP selection to be based on\n   administratively
    selected metrics, such as data transmission delays,\n   path preferences, and
    routing metrics, or a combination of metrics.\n   ECMPs are frequently used in
    networks to provide redundancy and to\n   increase available bandwidth.  A PIM
    router selects a path in the\n   ECMP based on its own implementation-specific
    choice.  The selection\n   is a local decision.  One way is to choose the PIM
    neighbor with the\n   highest IP address; another is to pick the PIM neighbor
    with the best\n   hash value over the destination and source addresses.\n   While
    implementations supporting ECMP have been deployed widely, the\n   existing RPF
    selection methods have weaknesses.  The lack of\n   administratively effective
    ways to allocate traffic over alternative\n   paths is a major issue.  For example,
    there is no straightforward way\n   to tell two downstream routers to select either
    the same or different\n   RPF neighbor routers for the same traffic flows.\n   With
    the ECMP Redirect mechanism introduced here, the upstream\n   routers use a PIM
    ECMP Redirect message to instruct the downstream\n   routers on how to tiebreak
    among the upstream neighbors.  The PIM\n   ECMP Redirect message conveys the tiebreak
    information based on\n   metrics selected administratively.\n"

    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n   This
    document uses terms defined in [RFC4601] to describe actions\n   taken by PIM
    routers.\n   The following terms have special significance for ECMP Redirect:\n
    \  o  Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP).  In this document, the term \"ECMP\"\n      refers
    to parallel, single-hop, equal-cost links between adjacent\n      nodes.\n   o
    \ ECMP Bundle.  An ECMP bundle is a set of PIM-enabled interfaces on\n      a
    router, where all interfaces belonging to the same bundle share\n      the same
    routing metric.  The next hops for the ECMP are all one\n      hop away.\n      There
    can be one or more ECMP bundles on any router, while one\n      individual interface
    can only belong to a single bundle.  ECMP\n      bundles are created on a router
    via configuration.\n   o  RPF.  RPF stands for Reverse Path Forwarding.\n   o
    \ Upstream.  Towards the root of the multicast forwarding tree.  An\n      upstream
    router refers to a router that is forwarding, or\n      potentially capable of
    forwarding, data packets onto interfaces in\n      an ECMP bundle.\n      When
    there are multiple routers forwarding packets onto interfaces\n      in the ECMP
    bundle, all these routers are called upstream routers.\n   o  Downstream.  Away
    from the root of the multicast forwarding tree.\n      A downstream router is
    a router that uses an interface in the ECMP\n      bundle as an RPF interface
    for a multicast forwarding entry.\n"
  title: 2.  Terminology

  - "3.  Overview\n   The existing PIM Assert mechanism allows the upstream router
    to\n   detect the existence of multiple forwarders for the same multicast\n   flow
    onto the same downstream interface.  The upstream router sends a\n   PIM Assert
    message containing a routing metric for the downstream\n   routers to use for
    tiebreaking among the multiple upstream forwarders\n   on the same RPF interface.\n
    \  With ECMP interfaces between the downstream and upstream routers, the\n   PIM
    ECMP Redirect mechanism works in a similar way, but extends the\n   ability to
    resolve the selection of forwarders among different\n   interfaces in the ECMP.\n
    \  When a PIM router downstream of the ECMP interfaces creates a new\n   (*,G)
    or (S,G) entry, it will populate the RPF interface and RPF\n   neighbor information
    according to the rules specified by [RFC4601].\n   This router will send its initial
    PIM Joins to that RPF neighbor.\n   When the RPF neighbor router receives the
    Join message and finds that\n   the receiving interface is one of the ECMP interfaces,
    it will check\n   if the same flow is already being forwarded out of another ECMP\n
    \  interface.  If so, this RPF neighbor router will send a PIM ECMP\n   Redirect
    message onto the interface the Join was received on.  The\n   PIM ECMP Redirect
    message contains the address of the desired RPF\n   neighbor, an Interface ID
    [RFC6395], and the other parameters used as\n   tiebreakers.  In essence, a PIM
    ECMP Redirect message is sent by an\n   upstream router to notify downstream routers
    to redirect PIM Joins to\n   the new RPF neighbor via a different interface.  When
    the downstream\n   routers receive this message, they SHOULD trigger PIM Joins
    toward\n   the new RPF neighbor specified in the packet.\n   This PIM ECMP Redirect
    message has similar functions as the existing\n   PIM Assert message:\n   1.  It
    is sent by an upstream router.\n   2.  It is used to influence the RPF selection
    by downstream routers.\n   3.  A tiebreaker metric is used.\n   However, the existing
    Assert message is used to select an upstream\n   router within the same multi-access
    network (such as a LAN), while\n   the Redirect message is used to select both
    a network and an upstream\n   router.\n   One advantage of this design is that
    the control messages are only\n   sent when there is a need to \"rebalance\" the
    traffic.  This reduces\n   the amount of control traffic.\n"

  - "4.  Applicability\n   The use of ECMP Redirect applies to shared trees or source
    trees\n   built with procedures described in [RFC4601].  The use of ECMP\n   Redirect
    in PIM Dense Mode [RFC3973] or in Bidirectional PIM\n   [RFC5015] is not considered
    in this document.\n   The enhancement described in this document can be applicable
    to a\n   number of scenarios.  For example, it allows a network operator to\n
    \  use ECMPs and have the ability to perform load splitting based on\n   bandwidth.
    \ To do this, the downstream routers perform RPF selection\n   with bandwidth,
    instead of IP addresses, as a tiebreaker.  The ECMP\n   Redirect mechanism assures
    that all downstream routers select the\n   desired network link and upstream router
    whenever possible.  Another\n   example is for a network operator to impose a
    transmission delay\n   limit on certain links.  The ECMP Redirect mechanism provides
    a means\n   for an upstream router to instruct a downstream router to choose a\n
    \  different RPF path.\n   This specification does not dictate the scope of applications
    of this\n   mechanism.\n"

    - "5.1.  Sending ECMP Redirect\n   ECMP Redirects are sent by an upstream router
      in a rate-limited\n   fashion, under either of the following conditions:\n   o
      \ It detects a PIM Join on a non-desired outgoing interface.\n   o  It detects
      multicast traffic on a non-desired outgoing interface.\n   In both cases, an
      ECMP Redirect is sent to the non-desired interface.\n   An outgoing interface
      is considered \"non-desired\" when:\n   o  The upstream router is already forwarding
      the same flow out of\n      another interface belonging to the same ECMP bundle.\n
      \  o  The upstream router is not yet forwarding the flow out any\n      interfaces
      of the ECMP bundle, but there is another interface with\n      more desired
      attributes.\n   An upstream router MAY choose not to send ECMP Redirects if
      it\n   becomes aware that some of the downstream routers are unreachable via\n
      \  some links in ECMP bundle.\n   An upstream router uses the Neighbor Address
      or the Interface ID\n   field in the ECMP Redirect message to indicate the interface
      it wants\n   traffic to be directed to.  This Neighbor Address MUST be associated\n
      \  with an interface in the same ECMP bundle as the ECMP Redirect\n   message's
      outgoing interface.  If the Interface ID field is ignored,\n   this Neighbor
      Address field uniquely identifies a LAN and an upstream\n   router to which
      a downstream router SHOULD redirect its Join\n   messages, and an ECMP Redirect
      message MUST be discarded if the\n   Neighbor Address field in the message does
      not match the cached\n   neighbor address.\n   The Interface ID field is used
      in IPv4 when one or more RPF neighbors\n   in the ECMP bundle are unnumbered,
      or in IPv6 where link-local\n   addresses are in use.  For other IPv4 usage,
      this field is zeroed\n   when sent, and ignored when received.  If the Router
      ID part of the\n   Interface ID is zero, the field MUST be ignored.  See [RFC6395]
      for\n   details of its assignment and usage in PIM Hellos.  If the Interface\n
      \  ID is not ignored, the receiving router of this message MUST use the\n   Interface
      ID, instead of Neighbor Address, to identify the new RPF\n   neighbor.  Additionally,
      an ECMP Redirect message MUST be discarded\n   if the Interface ID field in
      the message does not match the cached\n   Interface ID.\n"

    - "5.2.  Receiving ECMP Redirect\n   When a downstream router receives an ECMP
      Redirect, and detects that\n   the desired RPF path from its upstream router's
      point of view is\n   different from its current one, it should choose to join
      the newly\n   suggested path and prune from the current path.  The exact order
      of\n   such actions is implementation specific.\n   If a downstream router receives
      multiple ECMP Redirects sent by\n   different upstream routers, it SHOULD use
      the Preference, Metric, or\n   other fields as specified below as the tiebreakers
      to choose the most\n   preferred RPF interface and neighbor.  The tiebreak procedure
      is the\n   same as that used in PIM Assert processing described by [RFC4601].\n
      \  If an upstream router receives an ECMP Redirect, it SHOULD NOT change\n   its
      forwarding behavior even if the ECMP Redirect makes it a less\n   preferred
      RPF neighbor on the receiving interface.\n"

    - "5.3.  Transient State\n   During a transient network outage with a single link
      cut in an ECMP\n   bundle, a downstream router may lose connection to its RPF
      neighbor\n   and the normal ECMP Redirect operation may be interrupted\n   temporarily.
      \ In such an event, the following actions are\n   RECOMMENDED.\n   The downstream
      router SHOULD select a new RPF neighbor.  Among all\n   ECMP upstream routers,
      the preferred selection is the one on the LAN\n   that the previous RPF neighbor
      resided on.\n   If there is no upstream router reachable on the LAN that the
      previous\n   RPF neighbor resided on, the downstream router will select a new
      RPF\n   neighbor on a different LAN.  Among all ECMP upstream routers, the\n
      \  one that served as RPF neighbor before the link failure is preferred.\n   Such
      a router can be identified by the Router ID, which is part of\n   the Interface
      ID in the PIM ECMP Redirect Hello option.\n   During normal ECMP Redirect operations,
      when PIM Joins for the same\n   (*,G) or (S,G) are received on a different LAN,
      an upstream router\n   will send ECMP Redirect to prune the non-preferred LAN.
      \ Such ECMP\n   Redirects during partial network outage can be suppressed if
      the\n   upstream router decides that the non-preferred PIM Join is from a\n
      \  router that is not reachable via the preferred LAN.  This check can\n   be
      performed by retrieving the downstream router's Router ID, using\n   the source
      address in the PIM Join, and searching neighbors on the\n   preferred LAN for
      one with the same Router ID.\n"
    title: 5.3.  Transient State
  - contents:
    - "5.4.  Interoperability\n   If a PIM router supports this specification, it
      MUST send the PIM\n   ECMP Redirect Hello Option in its PIM Hello messages.\n
      \  A PIM router sends ECMP Redirects on an interface only when it\n   detects
      that all neighbors on that interface have sent this Hello\n   option.  If a
      PIM router detects that any of its neighbors on an ECMP\n   bundle does not
      support this Hello option, it SHOULD NOT send ECMP\n   Redirects to interfaces
      in that bundle; however, it SHOULD still\n   process any ECMP Redirects received
      from interfaces in that same\n   bundle.\n   If a PIM router does not support
