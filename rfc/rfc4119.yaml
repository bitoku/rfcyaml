  - "1.  Introduction\n   Geographical location information describes a physical position
    in\n   the world that may correspond to the past, present, or future\n   location
    of a person, event, or device.  Numerous applications used\n   in the Internet
    today benefit from sharing location information\n   (including mapping/navigation
    applications, 'friend finders' on cell\n   phones, and so on).  However, such
    applications may disclose the\n   whereabouts of a person in a manner contrary
    to the user's\n   preferences.  Privacy lapses may result from poor protocol security\n
    \  (which permits eavesdroppers to capture location information),\n   inability
    to articulate or accommodate user preferences, or similar\n   defects common in
    existing systems.  The privacy concerns surrounding\n   the unwanted disclosure
    of a person's physical location are among the\n   more serious issues that confront
    users on the Internet.\n   Consequently, a need has been identified to convey
    geographical\n   location information within an object that includes a user's
    privacy\n   and disclosure preferences and which is protected by strong\n   cryptographic
    security.  Previous work [13] has observed that this\n   problem bears some resemblance
    to the general problem of\n   communicating and securing presence information
    on the Internet.\n   Presence (defined in [12]) provides a real-time communications\n
    \  disposition for a user, and thus has similar requirements for\n   selective
    distribution and security.\n   Therefore, this document extends the XML-based
    Presence Information\n   Data Format (PIDF [2]) to allow the encapsulation of
    location\n   information within a presence document.\n   This document does not
    invent any format for location information\n   itself.  Numerous existing formats
    based on civic location,\n   geographic coordinates, and the like, have been developed
    in other\n   standards fora.  Instead, this document defines an object that is\n
    \  suitable both for identifying and encapsulating preexisting location\n   information
    formats, and for providing adequate security and policy\n   controls to regulate
    the distribution of location information over\n   the Internet.\n   The location
    object described in this document can be used\n   independently of any 'using
    protocol', as the term is defined in the\n   GEOPRIV requirements [10].  It is
    considered an advantage of this\n   proposal that existing presence protocols
    (such as [14]) would\n   natively accommodate the location object format defined
    in this\n   document, and be capable of composing location information with other\n
    \  presence information, because this location object is an extension of\n   PIDF.
    \ However, the usage of this location object format is not\n   limited to presence-using
    protocols-- any protocol that can carry XML\n   or MIME types can carry PIDF.\n
    \  Some of the requirements in [10] and [11] concern data collection and\n   usage
    policies associated with location objects.  This document\n   provides only the
    minimum markup necessary for a user to express the\n   necessary privacy preferences
    as specified by the GEOPRIV\n   requirements (the three basic elements in [11]).
    \ However, this\n   document does not demonstrate how a full XML-based ruleset,\n
    \  accommodating the needs of Location Servers, could be embedded in\n   PIDF.
    \ It is assumed that other protocols (such as HTTP) will be used\n   to move rules
    between Rule Holders and Location Servers, and that\n   full rulesets will be
    defined in a separate document.\n"

  title: 2.  Location Object Format
- contents:
  - "2.1.  Baseline PIDF Usage\n   The GEOPRIV requirements [10] (or REQ for short)
    specify the need for\n   a name for the person, place or thing that location information\n
    \  describes (REQ 2.1).  PIDF has such an identifier already:  every\n   PIDF
    document has an \"entity\" attribute of the 'presence' element\n   that signifies
    the URI of the entity whose presence the document\n   describes.  Consequently,
    if location information is contained in a\n   PIDF document, the URI in the \"entity\"
    attribute of the 'presence'\n   element indicates the target of that location
    information (the\n   'presentity').  The URI in the \"entity\" attribute generally
    uses the\n   \"pres\" URI scheme defined in [3].  Such URIs can serve as unlinkable\n
    \  pseudonyms (per REQ 12).\n   PIDF optionally contains a 'contact' element that
    provides a URI\n   where the presentity can be reached by some means of communication.\n
    \  Usually, the URI scheme in the value of the 'contact' element gives\n   some
    sense of how the presentity can be reached; if it uses the SIP\n   URI scheme,
    for example, SIP can be used, and so on.  Location\n   information can be provided
    without any associated means of\n   communication.  Thus, the 'contact' element
    may or may not be\n   present, as desired by the creator of the PIDF document.\n
    \  PIDF optionally contains a 'timestamp' element that designates the\n   time
    at which the PIDF document was created.  This element\n   corresponds to REQ 2.7a.\n
    \  PIDF contains a 'status' element, which is mandatory.  'status'\n   contains
    an optional child element, 'basic', that describes the\n   presentity's communications
    disposition (in very broad terms: either\n   OPEN or CLOSED).  For the purposes
    of this document, it is not\n   necessary for 'basic' status to be included.  If,
    however,\n   communications disposition is included in a PIDF document above and\n
    \  beyond geolocation, then 'basic' status may appear in a PIDF document\n   that
    uses these extensions.\n   PIDF also contains a 'tuple' umbrella element, which
    holds an \"id\"\n   element used to uniquely identify a segment of presence information\n
    \  so that changes to this information can be tracked over time (as\n   multiple
    notifications of presence are received).  'timestamp',\n   'status', and 'contact'
    are composed under 'tuple'.\n"
  title: 2.1.  Baseline PIDF Usage
- contents:
  - "2.2.  Extensions to PIDF for Location and Usage Rules\n   This XML Schema extends
    the 'status' element of PIDF with a complex\n   element called 'geopriv'.  There
    are two major subelements that are\n   encapsulated within geopriv: one for location
    information, and one\n   for usage rules.  Both of these subelements are mandatory,
    and are\n   described in subsequent sections.  By composing these two subelements\n
    \  under 'geopriv', the usage rules are clearly and explicitly\n   associated
    with the location information.\n   For extensibility (see REQ 1.4), the schema
    allows any other\n   subelements to appear under the 'geopriv' element.  Two other\n
    \  optional subelements are included in this document: one that\n   indicates
    the method by which geographical location was determined,\n   and one that allows
    an explicit designation of the entity that\n   provided the information.\n"
  title: 2.2.  Extensions to PIDF for Location and Usage Rules
- contents:
  - "2.2.1.  'location-info' Element\n   Each 'geopriv' element MUST contain one 'location-info'
    element.  A\n   'location-info' element consists of one or more chunks of location\n
    \  information (per REQ 2.5).  The format of the location information\n   (REQ
    2.6) is identified by the imported XML Schema, which describes\n   the namespace
    in question.  All PIDF documents that contain a\n   'geopriv' element MUST contain
    one or more import directives\n   indicating the XML Schema(s) that are used for
    geographic location\n   formats.\n   In order to ensure interoperability of GEOPRIV
    implementations, it is\n   necessary to select a baseline location format that
    all compliant\n   implementations support (see REQ 3.1).  Because it satisfies
    REQ\n   2.5.1, this document works from the assumption that Geography Markup\n
    \  Language (GML) 3.0 [15] shall be this mandatory format (a MUST\n   implement
    for all PIDF implementations supporting the 'geopriv'\n   element).\n   GML is
    an extraordinarily thorough and versatile system for modeling\n   all manner of
    geographic object types, topologies, metadata,\n   coordinate reference systems,
    and units of measurement.  The simplest\n   package for GML supporting location\n
    \  information is the 'feature.xsd' schema.  Although 'feature.xsd' can\n   express
    complicated geographical concepts, it requires very little\n   markup to provide
    basic coordinate points for the most commonly used\n   cases.  Various format
    descriptions (including latitude/longitude\n   based location information) are
    supported by Feature (see section\n   7.4.1.4 of [15] for examples), which resides
    here:\n      urn:opengis:specification:gml:schema-xsd:feature:v3.0\n   Note that
    by importing the Feature schema, necessary GML baseline\n   schemas are transitively
    imported.\n   Complex features (such as modeling topologies and polygons,\n   directions
    and vectors, temporal indications of the time for which a\n   particular location
    is valid for a target) are also available in GML,\n   but require importing additional
    schemas.  For the purposes of\n   baseline interoperability as defined by this
    document, only support\n   for the 'feature.xsd' GML schema is REQUIRED.\n   Implementations
    MAY support the civic location format (civicLoc)\n   defined in Section 2.2.5.

  - "2.2.2.  'usage-rules' Element\n   At the time this document was written, the
    policy requirements for\n   GEOPRIV objects were not definitively completed.  However,
    the\n   'usage-rules' element exists to satisfy REQ 2.8 and the requirements\n
    \  of the GEOPRIV policy requirements [11] document.  Each 'geopriv'\n   element
    MUST contain one 'usage-rules' element, even if the Rule\n   Maker has requested
    that all subelements be given their default\n   values.\n   Following the policy
    requirements document (Section 3.1), there are\n   three fields that need to be
    expressible in Location Objects\n   throughout their lifecycle (from Generator
    to Recipient):  one field\n   that limits retransmission, one that limits retention,
    and one that\n   contains a reference to external rulesets.  Those three fields
    are\n   instantiated here by the first three elements.  The fourth element\n   provides
    a generic space for human-readable policy directives.  Any\n   of these fields
    MAY be present in a Location Object 'usage-rules'\n   element; none are required
    to be.\n   'retransmission-allowed': When the value of this element is 'no', the\n
    \     Recipient of this Location Object is not permitted to share the\n      enclosed
    Location Information, or the object as a whole, with\n      other parties.  When
    the value of this element is 'yes',\n      distributing this Location is permitted
    (barring an existing out-\n      of-band agreement or obligation to the contrary).
    \ By default, the\n      value MUST be assumed to be 'no'.  Implementations MUST
    include\n      this field, with a value of 'no', if the Rule Maker specifies no\n
    \     preference.\n   'retention-expires': This field specifies an absolute date
    at which\n      time the Recipient is no longer permitted to possess the location\n
    \     information and its encapsulating Location Object; both may be\n      retained
    only until the time specified by this field.  By default,\n      the value MUST
    be assumed to be twenty-four hours from the\n      'timestamp' element in the
    PIDF document, if present; if the\n      'timestamp' element is also not present,
    then the value MUST be\n      assumed to be twenty-four hours from the time at
    which the\n      Location Object is received by the Location Recipient.  If the\n
    \     value in the 'retention-expires' element has already passed when\n      the
    Location Recipient receives the Location Object, the Recipient\n      MUST discard
    the Location Object immediately.\n   'ruleset-reference': This field contains
    a URI that indicates where a\n      fuller ruleset of policies, related to this
    object, can be found.\n      This URI SHOULD use the HTTPS URI scheme; and if
    it does, the\n      server that holds these rules MUST authenticate any attempt
    to\n      access these rules.  Usage rules themselves may divulge private\n      information
    about a Target or Rule Maker.  The URI MAY,\n      alternatively, use the CID
    URI scheme [7], in which case it MUST\n      denote a MIME body carried with the
    Location Object by the using\n      protocol.  Rulesets carried as MIME bodies
    SHOULD be encrypted and\n      signed by the Rule Maker; unsigned rulesets SHOULD
    NOT be honored\n      by Location Servers or Location Recipients.  Note that in
    order to\n      avoid network lookups that result in an authorization failure,\n
    \     creators of Location Objects MAY put HTTPS-based ruleset-\n      references
    into an encrypted external MIME body referenced by a\n      CID; in this way,
    recipients of the Location Object that are\n      unable to decrypt the external
    MIME body will not learn the HTTPS\n      URI unless they are able to decrypt
    the MIME body.\n   'note-well': This field contains a block of text containing
    further\n      generic privacy directives.  These directives are intended to be\n

  - "2.2.3.  'method' Element\n   The optional 'method' element describes the way
    that the location\n   information was derived or discovered.  An example of this
    element\n   (for a geographical position system) is:\n          <method>gps</method>\n
    \  The possible values of the 'method' element are enumerated within an\n   IANA
    registry.  Implementations MUST limit the use of this method to\n   the values
    shepherded by IANA.  This document pre-populates the IANA\n   registry with seven
    possible values; see Section 6.1 for more\n   information.\n   The 'method' element
    is useful, for example, when multiple sources\n   are reporting location information
    for a given user, and some means\n   of determining location might be considered
    more authoritative than\n   others (i.e., a dynamic, real-time position system
    versus static\n   provisioning associated with a target device).  However, note
    that\n   inclusion of 'method' might reveal sensitive information when the\n   generator
    is providing intentionally coarsened location information.\n   For example, when
    a LO is transmitted with 'DHCP' as the 'method',\n   but the location information
    indicates only the city in which the\n   generator is located, the sender has
    good justification to suspect\n   that some location information is being withheld.\n"

- contents:
  - "2.2.4.  'provided-by' Element\n   The optional 'provided-by' element describes
    the entity or\n   organization that supplied this location information (beyond
    the\n   domain information that can be inferred from a signing certificate).\n
    \  An example of this element (for a made-up game system) might be:\n          <provided-by>\n
    \            <test:game>\n                West5\n             </test:game>\n          </provided-by>\n
    \  Values for the 'provided-by' element MUST be IANA-registered XML\n   namespaces;
    see Section 6.2 for more information.\n   The 'provided-by' element is not intended
    for use by most entities,\n   but rather to meet special requirements for which
    overhead (IANA\n   registration, location object size) and potential location\n
    \  information leakage are acceptable choices.\n   In general cases, the entity
    that supplied location information is\n   communicated by the subjectAltName of
    the certificate with which the\n   location object is signed; thus, this element
    is unnecessary.\n   'Provided-by' is meaningful in particular cases when the creator
    of a\n   location object wants to designate a particular system or party\n   within
    a complex administrative domain, including situations\n   envisioned for providing
    emergency services in a diverse national\n   context.  It might assist, for example,
    the recipient of a malformed\n   or misleading location object in identifying
    the particular system\n   that malfunctioned.\n   Users should be aware that this
    information can inadvertently provide\n   additional information to the receiver,
    increasing the effective\n   resolution of the geospatial or civic information,
    or even revealing\n   some location information, when it was meant to be entirely\n
    \  protected.  Consider if there were circumstances that influenced\n   Columbia
    University to elect to register and use the provided-by\n   element.  If an example
    LO includes only state-level information,\n   then including the fact that the
    location information was provided by\n   Columbia University provides a strong
    indication that the Target is\n   actually located in a four-block area in Manhattan.
    \ Accordingly,\n   this element should be used only when organizational functions\n
    \  strongly would depend on it.  In all but such usages, the\n   subjectAltName
    of the certificate will suffice, and 'provided-by'\n   SHOULD NOT be used.\n"

    is outside the\n   scope of this document.\n"
  title: 3.  Carrying PIDF in a Using Protocol
- contents:
  - "4.  Securing PIDF\n   There are a number of ways in which XML documents can be
    secured.\n   XML itself supports several ways of partially securing documents,\n
    \  including element-level encryption and digital signature properties.\n   For
    the purposes of this document, only the securing of a PIDF\n   document as a whole,
    rather than element-by-element security, is\n   considered.  None of the requirements
    [10] suggest that only part of\n   the information in a location object might
    need to be protected while\n   other parts are unprotected; virtually any such
    configuration would\n   introduce potentials for privacy leakage.  Consequently,
    the use of\n   MIME-level security is appropriate.\n   S/MIME [5] allows security
    properties (including confidentiality,\n   integrity, and authentication properties)
    to be applied to the\n   contents of a MIME body.  Therefore, all PIDF implementations
    that\n   support the XML Schema extensions for location information described\n
    \  in this document MUST support S/MIME; in particular, they MUST\n   support
    the CMS [6] EnvelopedData and SignedData content types, which\n   are used for
    encryption and digital signatures, respectively.  It is\n   believed that this
    mechanism meets REQs 2.10, 13, 14.1, 14.2, 14.3,\n   and 14.4.\n   Additionally,
    all compliant applications MUST implement the AES\n   encryption algorithm for
    S/MIME, as specified in [8] (and per REQ\n   15.1).  Of course, implementations
    MUST also support the baseline\n   encryption and digital signature algorithms
    described in the S/MIME\n   specification.\n   S/MIME generally entails the use
    of X.509 [9] certificates.  In order\n   to encrypt a request for a particular
    destination end-to-end (i.e.,\n   to a Location Recipient), the Location Generator
    must possess\n   credentials (typically an X.509 certificate) that have been issued
    to\n   the Location Recipient.  Implementations of this specification SHOULD\n
    \  support X.509 certificates for S/MIME, and MUST support password-\n   based
    CMS encryption (see [6]).  Any symmetric keying systems SHOULD\n   derive high-entropy
    content encoding keys (CEKs).  When X.509\n   certificates are used to sign PIDF
    Location Objects, the\n   subjectAltName of the certificate SHOULD use the \"pres\"
    URI scheme.\n   One envisioned deployment model for S/MIME in PIDF documents is
    the\n   following.  Location Servers hold X.509 certificates and share\n   secrets
    with Location Generators and Location Recipients.  When a\n   Generator sends
    location information to a Server, it can be encrypted\n   with S/MIME (or any
    lower-layer encryption specific to the using\n   protocol).  When a Server forwards
    location information to a\n   Recipient, location information can be encrypted
    with password-based\n   CMS encryption.  This allows the use of encryption when
    the Location\n   Recipient does not possess its own X.509 certificate.\n   S/MIME
    was designed for end-to-end security between email peers that\n   communicate
    through multiple servers (i.e mail transfer agents) that\n   do not modify message
    bodies.  There is, however, at least one\n   instance in which Location Servers
    modify Location Objects:  when\n   Location Servers enforce policies on behalf
    of the Rule Maker.  For\n   example, a Rule Maker may specify that Location Information
    should be\n   coarsened (made less specific) before it is transmitted to particular\n
    \  recipients.  If the Location Server were unable to modify a Location\n   Object,
    because it was encrypted, signed, or both, it would be unable\n   to accomplish
    this function.  Consequently, when a Location Generator\n   wants to allow a Location
    Server to modify such messages, they MAY\n   encrypt such messages with a key
    that can be decrypted by the\n   Location Server (the digital signature, of course,
    can still be\n   created with keying material from the Location Generator's\n
    \  certificate).  After modifying the Location Object, the Location\n   Server
    can re-sign the Object with its own credentials (encrypting it\n   with any keys
    issued to the Location Recipient, if they are known to\n   the Server).\n   Note
    that policies for data collection and usage of location\n   information, in so
    far as they are carried within a location object,\n   are discussed in Section
    2.2.2.\n"

  - "6.1.  'method' Tokens\n   This document requests that the IANA create a new registry
    for\n   'method' tokens associated with the PIDF-LO object.  'method' tokens\n
    \  are text strings designating the manner in which location information\n   in
    a PIDF-LO object has been derived or discovered.  Any party may\n   register new
    'method' tokens with the IANA, as needed, on a first-\n   come-first-serve basis.\n
    \  This section pre-registers 7 new 'method' tokens associated with the\n   'method'
    element described above in Section 2.2.3:\n      GPS: Global Positioning System\n
    \     A-GPS: GPS with assistance\n      Manual: entered manually by an operator
    or user, e.g., based on\n      subscriber billing or service location information\n
    \     DHCP: provided by DHCP (used for wireline access networks, see\n      802.11
    below)\n      Triangulation: triangulated from time-of-arrival, signal strength,\n
    \     or similar measurements\n      Cell: location of the cellular radio antenna\n
    \     802.11: 802.11 access point (used for DHCP-based provisioning over\n      wireless
    access networks)\n"

    registry of XML\n   namespaces for 'provided-by' elements for use with PIDF-LO
    objects.\n   Registrations of new XML namespaces that are used for 'provided-by'\n
    \  MUST be reviewed by an Expert Reviewer designated by the IESG.\n   This document
    pre-registers a single XML namespace for 'provided-by',\n   which is given in

    members of the\n   GEOPRIV IETF working group.  Special thanks to Carl Reed of
    OpenGIS\n   for a close read of the document.\n   The civic location format described
    in this document was proposed by\n   Henning Schulzrinne for communicating location
    information in DHCP,\n   and has been appropriated in its entirety for this document.\n
    \  James M.  Polk provided the text related to the 'method' element, and\n   much
    of the text for the 'provided-by' element.  The text of Appendix\n   A was written
