  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC4364] specifies architecture, protocols, and procedures\
    \ that a\n   Service Provider (SP) can use to provide Virtual Private Network\n\
    \   (VPN) service to its customers.  In that architecture, one or more\n   Customer\
    \ Edge (CE) routers attach to a Provider Edge (PE) router.\n   Each CE router\
    \ belongs to a single VPN, but CE routers from several\n   VPNs may attach to\
    \ the same PE router.  In addition, CEs from the\n   same VPN may attach to different\
    \ PEs.  BGP is used to carry VPN-\n   specific information among the PEs.  Each\
    \ PE router maintains a\n   separate Virtual Routing and Forwarding table (VRF)\
    \ for each VPN to\n   which it is attached.\n   [RFC6513] and [RFC6514] extend\
    \ the procedures of [RFC4364] to allow\n   the SP to provide multicast service\
    \ to its VPN customers.  The\n   customer's multicast routing protocol (e.g.,\
    \ PIM) is used to exchange\n   multicast routing information between a CE and\
    \ a PE.  The PE stores a\n   given customer's multicast routing information in\
    \ the VRF for that\n   customer's VPN.  BGP is used to distribute certain multicast-related\n\
    \   control information among the PEs that attach to a given VPN, and BGP\n  \
    \ may also be used to exchange the customer multicast routing\n   information\
    \ itself among the PEs.\n   While this multicast architecture was originally developed\
    \ for VPNs,\n   it can also be used (with a small number of modifications to the\n\
    \   procedures) to distribute multicast routing information that is not\n   specific\
    \ to VPNs.  The purpose of this document is to specify the way\n   in which BGP-MVPN\
    \ procedures can be adapted to support non-VPN\n   multicast.\n   Multicast routing\
    \ information that is not specific to VPNs is stored\n   in a router's \"global\
    \ table\", rather than in a VRF; hence, it is\n   known as \"Global Table Multicast\"\
    \ (GTM).  GTM is sometimes more\n   simply called \"Internet multicast\".  However,\
    \ we will avoid that term\n   because it suggests that the multicast data streams\
    \ are available on\n   the \"public\" Internet.  The procedures for GTM can certainly\
    \ be used\n   to support multicast on the public Internet, but they can also be\n\
    \   used to support multicast streams that are not public, e.g., content\n   distribution\
    \ streams offered by content providers to paid\n   subscribers.  For the purposes\
    \ of this document, all that matters is\n   that the multicast routing information\
    \ is maintained in a global\n   table rather than in a VRF.\n   This architecture\
    \ does assume that the network over which the\n   multicast streams travel can\
    \ be divided into a \"core network\" and one\n   or more non-core parts of the\
    \ network, which we shall call\n   \"attachment networks\".  The multicast routing\
    \ protocol used in the\n   attachment networks may not be the same as the one\
    \ used in the core,\n   so we consider there to be a \"protocol boundary\" between\
    \ the core\n   network and the attachment networks.  We will use the term \"Protocol\n\
    \   Boundary Router\" (PBR) to refer to the core routers that are at the\n   boundary.\
    \  We will use the term \"Attachment Router\" (AR) to refer to\n   the routers\
    \ that attach to the PBRs but are not in the core.\n   This document does not\
    \ make any particular set of assumptions about\n   the protocols that the ARs\
    \ and the PBRs use to exchange unicast and\n   multicast routing information with\
    \ each other.  For instance,\n   multicast routing information could be exchanged\
    \ between an AR and a\n   PBR via PIM, IGMP, or even BGP.  Multicast routing also\
    \ depends on an\n   exchange of routes that are used for looking up the path to\
    \ the root\n   of a multicast tree.  This routing information could be exchanged\n\
    \   between an AR and a PBR via IGP, via EBGP, or via IBGP [RFC6368].\n   Note\
    \ that if IBGP is used, the \"push\" and \"pop\" procedures described\n   in [RFC6368]\
    \ are not necessary.\n   The PBRs are not necessarily \"edge routers\", in the\
    \ sense of\n   [RFC4364].  For example, they may be both be Autonomous System\
    \ Border\n   Routers (ASBRs).  As another example, an AR may be an \"access router\"\
    \n   attached to a PBR that is an OSPF Area Border Router (ABR).  Many\n   other\
    \ deployment scenarios are possible.  However, the PBRs are\n   always considered\
    \ to be delimiting a \"backbone\" or \"core\" network.  A\n   multicast data stream\
    \ from an AR is tunneled over the core network\n   from an ingress PBR to one\
    \ or more egress PBRs.  Multicast routing\n   information that a PBR learns from\
    \ the ARs attached to it is stored\n   in the PBR's global table.  The PBRs use\
    \ BGP to distribute multicast\n   routing and auto-discovery information among\
    \ themselves.  This is\n   done following the procedures of [RFC6513], [RFC6514],\
    \ and other MVPN\n   specifications, as modified in this document.\n   In general,\
    \ PBRs follow the same BGP-MVPN procedures that PE routers\n   follow, except\
    \ that these procedures are adapted to be applicable to\n   the global table rather\
    \ than to a VRF.  Details are provided in\n   subsequent sections of this document.\n\
    \   By supporting GTM using the BGP procedures designed for MVPN, one\n   obtains\
    \ a single control plane that governs the use of both VPN and\n   non-VPN multicast.\
    \  Most of the features and characteristics of MVPN\n   carry over automatically\
    \ to GTM.  These include scaling, aggregation,\n   flexible choice of tunnel technology\
    \ in the SP network, support for\n   both segmented and non-segmented tunnels,\
    \ ability to use wildcards to\n   identify sets of multicast flows, support for\
    \ the Any-Source\n   Multicast (ASM), Source-Specific Multicast (SSM), and Bidirectional\n\
    \   (bidir) multicast paradigms, support for both IPv4 and IPv6 multicast\n  \
    \ flows over either an IPv4 or IPv6 SP infrastructure, support for\n   unsolicited\
    \ flooded data (including support for Bootstrap Router\n   (BSR) as an RP-to-group\
    \ mapping protocol), etc.\n   This document not only uses MVPN procedures for\
    \ GTM but also, insofar\n   as possible, uses the same protocol elements, encodings,\
    \ and formats.\n   The BGP Updates for GTM thus use the same Subsequent Address\
    \ Family\n   Identifier (SAFI) and have the same Network Layer Reachability\n\
    \   Information (NLRI) format as the BGP Updates for MVPN.\n   Details for supporting\
    \ MVPN (either IPv4 or IPv6 MVPN traffic) over\n   an IPv6 backbone network can\
    \ be found in [RFC6515].  The procedures\n   and encodings described therein are\
    \ also applicable to GTM.\n   [RFC7524] extends [RFC6514] by providing procedures\
    \ that allow\n   tunnels through the core to be \"segmented\" at ABRs within the\
    \ core.\n   The ABR segmentation procedures are also applicable to GTM as defined\n\
    \   in the current document.  In general, the MVPN procedures of\n   [RFC7524],\
    \ adapted as specified in the current document, are\n   applicable to GTM.\n \
    \  [RFC7524] also defines a set of procedures for GTM.  Those procedures\n   are\
    \ different from the procedures defined in the current document,\n   and the two\
    \ sets of procedures are not interoperable with each other.\n   The two sets of\
    \ procedures can co-exist in the same network, as long\n   as they are not applied\
    \ to the same multicast flows or to the same\n   multicast group addresses.  See\
    \ Section 3 for more details.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Adapting MVPN Procedures to GTM
  contents:
  - "2.  Adapting MVPN Procedures to GTM\n   In general, PBRs support Global Table\
    \ Multicast by using the\n   procedures that PE routers use to support VPN multicast.\
    \  For GTM,\n   where [RFC6513] and [RFC6514] talk about the \"PE-CE interface\"\
    , one\n   should interpret that to mean the interface between the AR and the\n\
    \   PBR.  For GTM, where [RFC6513] and [RFC6514] talk about the\n   \"backbone\"\
    \ network, one should interpret that to mean the part of the\n   network that\
    \ is delimited by the PBRs.\n   A few adaptations to the procedures of [RFC6513]\
    \ and [RFC6514] need\n   to be made.  Those adaptations are described in the following\
    \ sub-\n   sections.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Use of Route Distinguishers
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Use of Route Distinguishers\n   The MVPN procedures require the use of\
    \ BGP routes, defined in\n   [RFC6514], that have a SAFI value of 5 (\"MCAST-VPN\"\
    ).  We refer to\n   these simply as \"MCAST-VPN routes\".  [RFC6514] defines the\
    \ Network\n   Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) format for MCAST-VPN routes.\n\
    \   The NLRI field always begins with a \"Route Type\" octet, and,\n   depending\
    \ on the route type, may be followed by a Route Distinguisher\n   (RD) field.\n\
    \   When a PBR originates an MCAST-VPN route in support of GTM, the RD\n   field\
    \ (for those routes types where it is defined) of that route's\n   NLRI MUST be\
    \ set to zero (i.e., to 64 bits of zero).  Since no VRF\n   may have an RD of\
    \ zero, this allows MCAST-VPN routes that are about\n   GTM to be distinguished\
    \ from MCAST-VPN routes that are about VPNs.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Use of Route Targets
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Use of Route Targets\n   The MVPN procedures require all MCAST-VPN routes\
    \ to carry Route\n   Targets (RTs).  When a PE router receives an MCAST-VPN route,\
    \ it\n   processes the route in the context of a particular VRF if and only if\n\
    \   the route is carrying an RT that is configured as one of that VRF's\n   \"\
    import RTs\".\n   There are two different kinds of RT used in MVPN.\n   o  One\
    \ kind of RT is carried only by the following MCAST-VPN route\n      types: C-multicast\
    \ Shared Tree Joins, C-multicast Source Tree\n      Joins, and Leaf auto-discovery\
    \ routes (A-D routes).  This kind of\n      RT identifies the PE router that has\
    \ been selected by the route's\n      originator as the \"Upstream PE\" or as\
    \ the \"Upstream Multicast Hop\"\n      (UMH) for a particular (set of) multicast\
    \ flow(s).  Per [RFC6514]\n      and [RFC6515], this RT must be an IPv4-address-specific\
    \ or IPv6-\n      address-specific Extended Community (EC), whose Global\n   \
    \   Administrator field identifies the Upstream PE or the UMH.  If the\n     \
    \ Global Administrator field identifies the Upstream PE, the Local\n      Administrator\
    \ field identifies a particular VRF in that PE.\n      The GTM procedures of this\
    \ document require the use of this type\n      of RT, in exactly the same situations\
    \ where it is used in the MVPN\n      specification [RFC6514].  However, one adaptation\
    \ is necessary:\n      the Local Administrator field of this kind of RT MUST always\
    \ be\n      set to zero, thus implicitly identifying the global table rather\n\
    \      than identifying a VRF.  We will refer to this kind of RT as an\n     \
    \ \"upstream-node-identifying RT\".\n   o  The other kind of RT is the conventional\
    \ RT first specified in\n      [RFC4364].  It does not necessarily identify a\
    \ particular router\n      by address but is used to constrain the distribution\
    \ of VPN routes\n      and to ensure that a given VPN route is processed in the\
    \ context\n      of a given VRF if and only if the route is carrying an RT that\
    \ has\n      been configured as one of that VRF's \"import RTs\".\n      Whereas\
    \ every VRF must be configured with at least one import RT,\n      there has been\
    \ no requirement to configure any RTs for the global\n      table of any router\
    \ until now.  As stated above, this document\n      makes the use of upstream-node-identifying\
    \ RTs mandatory for GTM.\n      This document makes the use of non-upstream-node-identifying\
    \ RTs\n      OPTIONAL for GTM.\n   The procedures for the use of RTs in GTM are\
    \ the following:\n   o  If the global table of a particular PBR is NOT configured\
    \ with any\n      import RTs, then a received MCAST-VPN route is processed in\
    \ the\n      context of the global table only if it is carrying no RTs or if it\n\
    \      is carrying an upstream-node-identifying RT whose Global\n      Administrator\
    \ field identifies that PBR.\n   o  The global table in each PBR MAY be configured\
    \ with (a) a set of\n      export RTs to be attached to MCAST-VPN routes that\
    \ are originated\n      to support GTM and (b) a set of import RTs for GTM.\n\
    \      If the global table of a given PBR has been so configured, the PBR\n  \
    \    will process a received MCAST-VPN route in the context of the\n      global\
    \ table if and only if the route carries an RT that is one of\n      the global\
    \ table's import RTs or if the route carries an upstream-\n      node-identifying\
    \ RT whose Global Administrator field identifies\n      the PBR.\n      If the\
    \ global tables are configured with RTs, care must be taken\n      to ensure that\
    \ the RTs configured for the global table are\n      distinct from any RTs used\
    \ in support of MVPN (except in the case\n      where it is actually intended\
    \ to create an \"extranet\"\n      [MVPN-extranet] in which some sources are reachable\
    \ in global\n      table context while others are reachable in VPN context.)\n\
    \   The \"RT Constraint\" procedures of [RFC4684] MAY be used to constrain\n \
    \  the distribution of MCAST-VPN routes (or other routes) that carry RTs\n   that\
    \ have been configured as import RTs for GTM.  (This includes the\n   upstream-node-identifying\
    \ RTs.)\n   N.B.: If the \"RT Constraint\" procedures of [RFC4684] are deployed,\n\
    \         but the MCAST-VPN routes are not carrying RTs, then proper\n       \
    \  operation requires the \"default behavior\" specified for the\n         MCAST-VPN\
    \ address family in Section 3 (\"Default Behavior\") of\n         [RTC_without_RTs].\n\
    \   In [RFC6513], the UMH-eligible routes (see Section 5.1.1 of\n   [RFC6513],\
    \ \"Eligible Routes for UMH Selection\") are generally routes\n   of SAFI 128\
    \ (Labeled VPN-IP routes) or 129 (VPN-IP multicast routes)\n   and are required\
    \ to carry RTs.  These RTs determine which VRFs import\n   which such routes.\
    \  However, for GTM, when the UMH-eligible routes\n   may be routes of SAFI 1,\
    \ 2, or 4, the routes are not required to\n   carry RTs.  This document does NOT\
    \ specify any new rules for\n   determining whether a SAFI 1, 2, or 4 route is\
    \ to be imported into\n   the global table of any PBR.\n"
- title: 2.3.  UMH-Eligible Routes
  contents:
  - "2.3.  UMH-Eligible Routes\n   Section 5.1 of [RFC6513] defines procedures by\
    \ which a PE router\n   determines the \"C-root\", the \"Upstream Multicast Hop\"\
    \ (UMH), the\n   \"Upstream PE\", and the \"Upstream RD\" of a given multicast\
    \ flow.  (In\n   non-VPN multicast documents, the UMH of a multicast flow at a\n\
    \   particular router is generally known as the \"RPF neighbor\" for that\n  \
    \ flow.)  It also defines procedures for determining the \"Source AS\" of\n  \
    \ a particular flow.  Note that in GTM, the \"Upstream PE\" is actually\n   the\
    \ \"Upstream PBR\".\n   The definition of the C-root of a flow is the same for\
    \ GTM as for\n   MVPN.\n   For MVPN, to determine the UMH, Upstream PE, Upstream\
    \ RD, and Source\n   AS of a flow, one looks up the C-root of the flow in a particular\
    \ VRF\n   and finds the \"UMH-eligible\" routes (see Section 5.1.1 of [RFC6513])\n\
    \   that \"match\" the C-root.  From among these, one is chosen as the\n   \"\
    Selected UMH Route\".\n   For GTM, the C-root is, of course, looked up in the\
    \ global table,\n   rather than in a VRF.  For MVPN, the UMH-eligible routes are\
    \ routes\n   of SAFI 128 or 129.  For GTM, the UMH-eligible routes are routes\
    \ of\n   SAFI 1, SAFI 4, or SAFI 2.  If the global table has imported routes\n\
    \   of SAFI 2, then these are the UMH-eligible routes.  Otherwise, routes\n  \
    \ of SAFI 1 or SAFI 4 are the UMH-eligible routes.  For the purpose of\n   UMH\
    \ determination, if a SAFI 1 route and a SAFI 4 route contain the\n   same IP\
    \ prefix in their respective NLRI fields, then the two routes\n   are considered\
    \ by the BGP best-path selection process to be\n   comparable.\n   [RFC6513] defines\
    \ procedures for determining which of the UMH-\n   eligible routes that match\
    \ a particular C-root is to become the\n   Selected UMH Route.  With one exception,\

  - "2.3.4.  Why SFS Does Not Apply to GTM\n   To see why the SFS procedure cannot\
    \ be applied to GTM, consider the\n   following example scenario.  Suppose some\
    \ multicast source S is homed\n   to both PBR1 and PBR2, and suppose that both\
    \ PBRs export a route (of\n   SAFI 1, 2, or 4) whose NLRI is a prefix matching\
    \ the address of S.\n   These two routes will be considered comparable by the\
    \ BGP decision\n   process.  A route reflector receiving both routes may thus\
    \ choose to\n   redistribute just one of the routes to S, the one chosen by the\
    \ best-\n   path algorithm.  Different route reflectors may even choose different\n\
    \   routes to redistribute (i.e., one route reflector may choose the\n   route\
    \ to S via PBR1 as the best path, while another chooses the route\n   to S via\
    \ PBR2 as the best path).  As a result, some PBRs may receive\n   only the route\
    \ to S via PBR1, and some may receive only the route to\n   S via PBR2.  In that\
    \ case, it is impossible to ensure that all PBRs\n   will choose the same route\
    \ to S.\n   The SFS procedure works in VPN context as long as the following\n\
    \   assumption holds: if S is homed to VRF-x in PE1 and to VRF-y in PE2,\n   then\
    \ VRF-x and VRF-y have been configured with different RDs.  In VPN\n   context,\
    \ the route to S is of SAFI 128 or 129 and thus has an RD in\n   its NLRI.  So\
    \ the route to S via PE1 will not have the same NLRI as\n   the route to S via\
    \ PE2.  As a result, all PEs will see both routes,\n   and the PEs can implement\
    \ a procedure that ensures that they all pick\n   the same route to S.\n   That\
    \ is, the SFS procedure of [RFC6513] relies on the UMH-eligible\n   routes being\
    \ of SAFI 128 or 129 and relies on certain VRFs being\n   configured with distinct\
    \ RDs.  Thus, the procedure cannot be applied\n   to GTM.\n   One might think\
    \ that the SFS procedure could be applied to GTM as\n   long as the procedures\
    \ defined in [ADD-PATH] are applied to the UMH-\n   eligible routes.  Using the\
    \ [ADD-PATH] procedures, the BGP speakers\n   could advertise more than one path\
    \ to a given prefix.  Typically,\n   [ADD-PATH] is used to report the n best paths,\
    \ for some small value\n   of n.  However, this is not sufficient to support SFS,\
    \ as can be seen\n   by examining the following scenario:\n                  \

    \    |         |\n                   |--PBR2---ASBR3--|--ASBR4--|---ASBR6\n  \
    \                                  |         |\n   In AS-X, PBR1 reports to both\
    \ ASBR1 and ASBR3 that it has a route to\n   S.  Similarly, PBR2 reports to both\
    \ ASBR1 and ASBR3 that it has a\n   route to S.  Using the procedures in [ADD-PATH],\
    \ ASBR1 reports both\n   routes to ASBR2, and ASBR3 reports both routes to ASBR4.\
    \  Now AS-Y\n   sees 4 paths to S.  The AS-Z ASBRs will each see eight paths (four\n\
    \   via ASBR2 and four via ASBR4).  To avoid this explosion in the number\n  \
    \ of paths, a BGP speaker that uses [ADD-PATH] is usually considered to\n   report\
    \ only the n best paths.  However, there is then no guarantee\n   that the reported\
    \ set of paths will contain at least one path via\n   PBR1 and at least one path\
    \ via PBR2.  Without such a guarantee, the\n   SFS procedure will not work.\n"

    \ are\n   the following:\n   o  The procedures for GTM described in [RFC7524]\
    \ do not use\n      C-multicast Shared Tree Joins or C-multicast Source Tree Joins\
    \ at\n      all.  The procedures of this document use these C-multicast routes\n\
    \      for GTM, setting the RD field of the NLRI to zero.\n   o  The procedures\
    \ for GTM described in [RFC7524] use Leaf A-D routes\n      instead of C-multicast\
    \ Shared/Source Tree Join routes.  Leaf A-D\n      routes used in that manner\
    \ can be distinguished from Leaf A-D\n      routes used as specified in [RFC6514]\
    \ by means of the NLRI format;\n      [RFC7524] defines a new NLRI format for\
    \ Leaf A-D routes.  Whether\n      or not a given Leaf A-D route is being used\
    \ according to the\n      procedures described in [RFC7524] can be determined\
    \ from its NLRI.\n      (See Section 6.2.2 (\"Leaf A-D Route for Global Table\
    \ Multicast\")\n      of [RFC7524]).\n   o  The Leaf A-D routes used by the current\
    \ document contain an NLRI\n      that is in the format defined in [RFC6514],\
    \ NOT in the format as\n      defined in [RFC7524].  The procedures assumed by\
    \ this document for\n      originating and processing Leaf A-D routes are as specified\
    \ in\n      [RFC6514], NOT as specified in [RFC7524].\n   o  The current document\
    \ uses an RD value of zero in the NLRI in order\n      to indicate that a particular\
    \ route is about a Global\n      Table Multicast rather than a VPN multicast.\
    \  No other semantics\n      are inferred from the fact that RD is zero.  [RFC7524]\
    \ uses two\n      different RD values in its GTM procedures, with semantic\n \
    \     differences that depend upon the RD values.\n   o  In order for both sets\
    \ of procedures to co-exist in the same\n      network, the PBRs MUST be provisioned\
    \ so that for any given IP\n      group address in the global table, all egress\
    \ PBRs use the same\n      set of procedures for that group address (i.e., for\
    \ group G,\n      either all egress PBRs use the GTM procedures of this document\
    \ or\n      all egress PBRs use the GTM procedures of [RFC7524]).\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of this document\
    \ are primarily the\n   security considerations of the base protocols, as discussed\
    \ in\n   [RFC6514], [RFC4601], and [RFC5294].\n   The protocols and procedures\
    \ described in this document make use of a\n   type of route (routes with the\
    \ \"MCAST-VPN\" BGP SAFI) that was\n   originally designed for use in VPN contexts\
    \ only.  The protocols and\n   procedures described in this document also make\
    \ use of various BGP\n   path attributes and extended communities (VRF Route Import\
    \ Extended\n   Community, Source AS Extended Community, and Route Target Extended\n\
    \   Community) that were originally intended for use in VPN contexts.  If\n  \
    \ these routes, attributes, and/or extended communities leak out into\n   the\
    \ wild, multicast data flows may be distributed in an unintended\n   and/or unauthorized\
    \ manner.\n   When VPNs are provisioned, each VRF is configured with import RTs\
    \ and\n   export RTs.  These RTs constrain the distribution and the import of\n\
    \   the VPN routes, making it difficult to cause a route to be\n   distributed\
    \ to and imported by a VRF that is not authorized to import\n   that route.  Additionally,\
    \ VPN routes do not go into the \"global\n   table\" with the \"ordinary Internet\
    \ routes\" (i.e., non-VPN routes),\n   and non-VPN routes do not impact the flow\
    \ of multicast data within a\n   VPN.  In GTM, some of these protections against\
    \ improper\n   distribution/import of the routes is lost -- import of the routes\
    \ is\n   not restricted to VRFs, and the RT infrastructure that controls the\n\
    \   distribution of routes among the VRFs is not present when routes are\n   exported\
    \ from and imported into global tables.\n   Internet Service Providers often make\
    \ extensive use of BGP extended\n   communities, sometimes adding, deleting, and/or\
    \ modifying a route's\n   extended communities as the route is distributed throughout\
    \ the\n   network.  Care should be taken to avoid deleting or modifying the VRF\n\
    \   Route Import Extended Community and Source AS Extended Community.\n   Incorrect\
    \ manipulation of these extended communities may result in\n   multicast streams\
    \ being lost or misrouted.\n   The procedures of this document require certain\
    \ BGP routes to carry\n   IP multicast group addresses.  Generally, such group\
    \ addresses are\n   only valid within a certain scope.  If a BGP route containing\
    \ a group\n   address is distributed outside the boundaries where the group address\n\
    \   is meaningful, unauthorized distribution of multicast data flows may\n   occur.\n"
