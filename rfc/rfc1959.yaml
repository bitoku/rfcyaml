- title: 1.  Abstract
  contents:
  - "1.  Abstract\n   LDAP is the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, defined in\
    \ [1] and\n   [2].  This document describes a format for an LDAP Uniform Resource\n\
    \   Locator which will allow Internet clients to have direct access to\n   the\
    \ LDAP protocol.  While LDAP currently is used only as a front end\n   to the\
    \ X.500 directory, the URL format described here is general\n   enough to handle\
    \ the case of stand-alone LDAP servers (i.e., LDAP\n   servers not back-ended\
    \ by X.500).\n"
- title: 2.  URL Definition
  contents:
  - "2.  URL Definition\n   An LDAP URL begins with the protocol prefix \"ldap\" and\
    \ is defined by\n   the following grammar.\n    <ldapurl> ::= \"ldap://\" [ <hostport>\
    \ ] \"/\" <dn> [ \"?\" <attributes>\n                        [ \"?\" <scope> \"\
    ?\" <filter> ] ]\n    <hostport> ::= <hostname> [ \":\" <portnumber> ]\n    <dn>\
    \ ::= a string as defined in RFC 1485\n    <attributes> ::= NULL | <attributelist>\n\
    \    <attributelist> ::= <attributetype>\n                        | <attributetype>\
    \ [ \",\" <attributelist> ]\n    <attributetype> ::= a string as defined in RFC\
    \ 1777\n    <scope> ::= \"base\" | \"one\" | \"sub\"\n    <filter> ::= a string\
    \ as defined in RFC 1558\n   The ldap prefix indicates an entry or entries residing\
    \ in the LDAP\n   server running on the given <hostname> at the given <portnumber>.\n\
    \   The default port is TCP port 389.  The <dn> is an LDAP Distinguished\n   Name\
    \ using the string format described in [1], with any URL-illegal\n   characters\
    \ (e.g., spaces) escaped using the % method described in RFC\n   1738.\n   The\
    \ <attributes> construct is used to indicate which attributes\n   should be returned\
    \ from the entry or entries.  Individual\n   <attributetype> names are as defined\
    \ for AttributeType in RFC 1777.\n   If the <attributes> part is omitted, all\
    \ attributes of the entry or\n   entries should be returned.\n   The <scope> construct\
    \ is used to specify the scope of the search to\n   perform in the given LDAP\
    \ server.  The allowable scopes are \"base\"\n   for a base object search, \"\
    one\" for a one-level search, or \"sub\" for\n   a subtree search.  If <scope>\
    \ is omitted, a scope of \"base\" is\n   assumed.\n   The <filter> is used to\
    \ specify the search filter to apply to entries\n   within the specified scope\
    \ during the search.  It has the format\n   specified in [4], with any URL-illegal\
    \ characters escaped using the %\n   method described in RFC 1738.  If <filter>\
    \ is omitted, a filter of\n   \"(objectClass=*)\" is assumed.\n   Note that if\
    \ the entry resides in the X.500 namespace, it should be\n   reachable from any\
    \ LDAP server that is providing front-end access to\n   the X.500 directory. \
    \ If the <hostport> part of the URL is missing,\n   the URL can be resolved by\
    \ contacting any X.500-back-ended LDAP\n   server.\n"

  - "3.  Examples\n   The following are some example LDAP URLs using the format defined\n\
    \   above.  An LDAP URL referring to the University of Michigan entry,\n   available\
    \ from any X.500-capable LDAP server:\n  ldap:///o=University%20of%20Michigan,c=US\n\
    \   An LDAP URL referring to the University of Michigan entry in a\n   particular\
    \ ldap server:\n  ldap://ldap.itd.umich.edu/o=University%20of%20Michigan,c=US\n\
    \   This URL corresponds to a base object search of the \"o=University of\n  \
    \ Michigan, c=US\" entry using a filter of (objectclass=*), requesting\n   all\
    \ attributes.\n   An LDAP URL referring to only the postalAddress attribute of\
    \ the\n   University of Michigan entry:\n  ldap://ldap.itd.umich.edu/o=University%20of%20Michigan,c=US?postalAddress\n\
    \   The corresponding LDAP search operation is the same as in the\n   previous\
    \ example, except that only the postalAddress attribute is\n   requested.\n  \
    \ An LDAP URL referring to the set of entries found by querying any\n   X.500-capable\
    \ LDAP server and doing a subtree search of the\n   University of Michigan for\
    \ any entry with a common name of \"Babs\n   Jensen\", retrieving all attributes:\n\
    \  ldap:///o=University%20of%20Michigan,c=US??sub?(cn=Babs%20Jensen)\n   An LDAP\
    \ URL referring to all children of the c=GB entry:\n  ldap://ldap.itd.umich.edu/c=GB?objectClass?one\n"

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The LDAP URL format does not provide a way to\
    \ specify credentials to\n   use when resolving the URL.  Therefore, it is expected\
    \ that such\n   requests will be unauthenticated. The security implications of\n\
    \   resolving an LDAP URL are the same as those of resolving any LDAP\n   query.\
    \ See the RFC 1777 for more details.\n"

    \ of the specification defined in\n   this document available.  It is an extension\
    \ to the libwww client\n   library, provided in both source and binary forms.\
    \  Also included are\n   binary versions of the Mosaic WWW client for various\
    \ platforms.  See\n   the following URL for more details:\n        ftp://terminator.rs.itd.umich.edu/ldap/url/\n"
