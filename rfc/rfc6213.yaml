- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol [RFC5880]\
    \ is a\n   protocol that allows for detection of a forwarding plane failure\n\
    \   between two routers.  A router can use [RFC5880] to validate that a\n   peer\
    \ router's forwarding ability is functioning.\n   One specific application of\
    \ BFD as described in [RFC5882] is to\n   verify the forwarding ability of an\
    \ IS-IS [RFC1195] router's\n   adjacencies; however, the method described in [RFC5882]\
    \ does not\n   allow for certain failure scenarios.  We will define a TLV that\
    \ will\n   allow for proper response to the detection of all forwarding failures\n\
    \   where the use of BFD is employed with IS-IS.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Requirements Language
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  The Problem
  contents:
  - "2.  The Problem\n   We observe that, in order to allow for mixed use (i.e., some\
    \ routers\n   running BFD and some not), [RFC5882] does not require a BFD session\n\
    \   be established prior to the establishment of an IS-IS adjacency.\n   Thus,\
    \ if a router A has neighbors B and C, and B does not support\n   BFD, A would\
    \ still form adjacencies with B and C, and it would only\n   establish a BFD session\
    \ with C.\n   The problem with this solution is that it assumes that the\n   transmission\
    \ and receipt of IS-IS Hellos (IIHs) shares fate with\n   forwarded data packets.\
    \  This is not a fair assumption to make given\n   that the primary use of BFD\
    \ is to protect IPv4 (and IPv6) forwarding,\n   and IS-IS does not utilize IPv4\
    \ or IPv6 for sending or receiving its\n   hellos.\n   Thus, if we consider our\
    \ previous example, and if C is currently\n   experiencing an IPv4 forwarding\
    \ failure that allows for IIHs to be\n   sent and received, when A first starts\
    \ (or restarts), A will assume\n   that C simply does not support BFD, will form\
    \ an adjacency with C,\n   and may incorrectly forward IPv4 traffic through C.\n"
- title: 3.  The Solution
  contents:
  - "3.  The Solution\n   A simple solution to this problem is for an IS-IS router\
    \ to advertise\n   that it has BFD enabled on a given interface.  It can do this\
    \ through\n   the inclusion of a TLV in its IIHs as described in this document.\n\
    \   When sending an IIH on a BFD enabled interface, a router that\n   supports\
    \ this extension MUST include the BFD-enabled TLV in its IIH.\n   The contents\
    \ of the TLV MUST indicate what topologies/protocols\n   [RFC5120] have been enabled\
    \ for BFD by including the appropriate\n   Multi-Topology Identifier (MTID)/ Network\
    \ Layer Protocol Identifier\n   (NLPID) pairs.\n   When sending an IIH on an interface\
    \ on which BFD is NOT enabled, a\n   router MUST NOT include the BFD-enabled TLV.\n"
- title: 3.1.  State Definitions
  contents:
  - "3.1.  State Definitions\n   The following definitions apply to each IS-IS neighbor:\n\
    \   For each locally supported MTID/NLPID pair, an\n   \"ISIS_TOPO_NLPID_BFD_REQUIRED\"\
    \ variable is assigned.  If BFD is\n   supported by both the local system and\
    \ the neighbor of the MTID/\n   NLPID, this variable is set to \"TRUE\".  Otherwise,\
    \ the variable is\n   set to \"FALSE\".\n   For each locally supported MTID, an\
    \ \"ISIS_TOPO_BFD_REQUIRED\" variable\n   is set to the logical \"OR\" of all\
    \ \"ISIS_TOPO_NLPID_BFD_REQUIRED\"\n   variables associated with that MTID.\n\
    \   An \"ISIS_BFD_REQUIRED\" variable is set to the logical \"AND\" of all\n \
    \  \"ISIS_TOPO_BFD_REQUIRED\" variables.\n   For each locally supported MTID/NLPID\
    \ pair, an\n   \"ISIS_TOPO_NLPID_STATE\" variable is assigned.  If\n   \"ISIS_TOPO_NLPID_BFD_REQUIRED\"\
    \ is \"TRUE\", this variable follows the\n   BFD session state for that MTID/NLPID\
    \ (\"UP == TRUE\").  Otherwise, the\n   variable is set to \"TRUE\".\n   For each\
    \ locally supported topology (MTID), an \"ISIS_TOPO_USEABLE\"\n   variable is\
    \ set to the logical \"AND\" of the set of\n   \"ISIS_TOPO_NLPID_STATE\" variables\
    \ associated with that MTID.\n   An \"ISIS_NEIGHBOR_USEABLE\" variable is set\
    \ to the logical \"OR\" of all\n   \"ISIS_TOPO_USEABLE\" variables.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Adjacency Establishment and Maintenance
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Adjacency Establishment and Maintenance\n   Whenever \"ISIS_BFD_REQUIRED\"\
    \ is \"TRUE\", the following extensions to\n   the rules for adjacency establishment\
    \ and maintenance MUST apply:\n   o  \"ISIS_NEIGHBOR_USEABLE\" MUST be \"TRUE\"\
    \ before the adjacency can\n      transition from \"INIT\" to \"UP\" state.\n\
    \   o  When the IS-IS adjacency is \"UP\" and \"ISIS_NEIGHBOR_USEABLE\"\n    \
    \  becomes \"FALSE\", the IS-IS adjacency MUST transition to \"DOWN\".\n   o \
    \ On a Point-to-Point circuit whenever \"ISIS_NEIGHBOR_USEABLE\" is\n      \"\
    FALSE\", the Three-Way adjacency state MUST be set to \"DOWN\" in\n      the Point-to-Point\
    \ Three-Way Adjacency TLV [RFC5303] in all\n      transmitted IIHs.\n   o  On\
    \ a LAN circuit whenever \"ISIS_NEIGHBOR_USEABLE\" is \"FALSE\", the\n      IS\
    \ Neighbors TLV advertising the Media Access Control (MAC)\n      address of the\
    \ neighbor MUST be omitted in all transmitted IIHs.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Advertisement of Topology-Specific IS Neighbors
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Advertisement of Topology-Specific IS Neighbors\n   The advertisement of\
    \ a topology-specific IS neighbor (as well as the\n   use of the neighbor in the\
    \ topology-specific decision process) is\n   determined by the value of \"ISIS_TOPO_USEABLE\"\
    \ for each topology.  If\n   \"ISIS_TOPO_USEABLE\" is \"TRUE\", then the topology-specific\
    \ neighbor is\n   advertised.  If \"ISIS_TOPO_USEABLE\" is \"FALSE\", then the\
    \ topology-\n   specific neighbor is not advertised.\n"
- title: 4.  Transition
  contents:
  - "4.  Transition\n   To allow for a non-disruptive transition to the use of BFD,\
    \ some\n   amount of time should be allowed before bringing down an \"UP\"\n \
    \  adjacency on a BFD enabled interface when the value of\n   \"ISIS_BFD_REQUIRED\"\
    \ becomes \"TRUE\" as a result of the introduction of\n   the BFD TLV or the modification\
    \ (by adding a new supported MTID/\n   NLPID) of an existing BFD TLV in a neighbor's\
    \ IIH.  A simple way to\n   do this is to not update the adjacency hold time when\
    \ receiving such\n   an IIH from a neighbor with whom we have an \"UP\" adjacency\
    \ until\n   \"ISIS_NEIGHBOR_USEABLE\" becomes \"TRUE\".\n   If the value of \"\
    ISIS_BFD_REQUIRED\" becomes \"FALSE\" as a result of\n   the removal the BFD TLV\
    \ or the modification (by removing a supported\n   MTID/NLPID) of an existing\
    \ BFD TLV in a neighbor's IIH, then BFD\n   session establishment is no longer\
    \ required to maintain the adjacency\n   or transition the adjacency to the \"\
    UP\" state.\n   If a BFD session is administratively shut down [RFC5880] and the\
    \ BFD\n   session state change impacts the value of \"ISIS_NEIGHBOR_USEABLE\"\
    ,\n   then IS-IS SHOULD allow time for the corresponding MTID/NLPID to be\n  \
    \ removed from the neighbor's BFD TLV by not updating the adjacency\n   hold time\
    \ until \"ISIS_BFD_REQUIRED\" becomes \"FALSE\".  Note that while\n   this allows\
    \ a non-disruptive transition, it still enforces\n   consistency between the administrative\
    \ state of the BFD session and\n   the MTID/NLPID(s) advertised in the BFD TLV.\
    \  This is necessary to\n   provide consistent behavior regardless of whether\
    \ the BFD AdminDown\n   state is introduced before or after an IS-IS adjacency\
    \ \"UP\" state has\n   been achieved.\n"
- title: 5.  Graceful Restart
  contents:
  - "5.  Graceful Restart\n   This section describes IS-IS implementation considerations\
    \ when both\n   IS-IS graceful restart [RFC5306] and BFD are co-deployed.\n  \
    \ In cases where BFD shares fate with the control plane, it can be\n   expected\
    \ that BFD session failure may occur in conjunction with the\n   control-plane\
    \ restart.  In such cases, premature abort of IS-IS\n   graceful restart as a\
    \ result of BFD session failure is undesirable.\n   Therefore, some mechanism\
    \ to ignore the BFD session failure for a\n   limited period of time would be\
    \ beneficial.  The issue of the\n   interaction between graceful restart and BFD\
    \ is described at length\n   in RFC 5882.  The implementation of this interaction\
    \ is outside the\n   scope of this document.\n"

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The TLV defined within this document describes\
    \ an addition to the\n   IS-IS Hello protocol.  Inappropriate use of this TLV\
    \ could prevent an\n   IS-IS adjacency from forming or lead to failure to detect\n\
    \   bidirectional forwarding failures -- each of which is a form of\n   denial\
    \ of service.  However, a party who can manipulate the contents\n   of this TLV\
    \ is already in a position to create such a denial of\n   service by disrupting\
