- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF email archive search tool, as specified in [RFC6778])\
    \ and\n   available at [mailarch], has been in use for nearly two years.\n   During\
    \ that time, there have been repeated requests for several\n   improvements. \
    \ This memo captures the requirements for a concerted\n   development effort to\
    \ provide those improvements.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Viewing by Thread
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Viewing by Thread\n   Currently, when the \"Group by Thread\" button is\
    \ selected, the\n   resulting list of messages is flat.  It is very hard to tell\
    \ where a\n   thread starts and stops.  This flat view interacts badly with sorting\n\
    \   (triggered by clicking on the column headers), leading to results\n   that\
    \ are confusing and sometimes incorrect.\n   This effort will:\n   o  Modify the\
    \ message list display, when grouped by thread, to show\n      each thread hierarchically.\n\
    \   o  Modify the sort performed by the clicking on the column headers to\n  \
    \    sort the overall list first by the parameters in the first message\n    \
    \  in the thread, and then sort within the thread (ensuring the\n      thread\
    \ grouping doesn't change based on these sorts).  When\n      viewing threads\
    \ sorted this way, the hierarchy will be flattened,\n      but the thread boundaries\
    \ will remain visibly distinct.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Navigation from the Message List View
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Navigation from the Message List View\n   This effort will add navigation\
    \ to the message list view, whether\n   viewing flat search results or viewing\
    \ by thread, making it simple\n   to:\n   o  Navigate to the previous/next message\
    \ by date in the set of listed\n      messages.\n   o  Navigate to the previous/next\
    \ message in a thread, to the first\n      message in a thread, and to the previous/next\
    \ thread displayed.\n   o  Navigate to any References or Replies (displayed as\
    \ Follow-Ups in\n      MHonArc) for the currently selected message.  These are\
    \ derived\n      from the References header field in the displayed message, and\
    \ the\n      In-Reply-To header field or the last value in the References\n  \
    \    header field of all other messages in the archive).\n   The UI will make\
    \ it possible to hide these navigation elements.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Navigation from a Single Message
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Navigation from a Single Message\n   Currently, when viewing a single message,\
    \ the only option for\n   navigating to related messages is to return to the message\
    \ list view\n   (either by date or by thread).  This is implemented with a new\
    \ search\n   based only on the details present in the message itself.  No\n  \
    \ information about any search that led to the message is retained.\n   This effort\
    \ will:\n   o  Add navigation to the single message view, enabling transition\
    \ to\n      previous/next in list and previous/next in thread.\n   o  Add navigation\
    \ enabling transition to previous/next in search, if\n      the message page being\
    \ displayed was arrived at by navigating from\n      the message list view of\
    \ a search result.\n   o  Add navigation to any References or Replies (displayed\
    \ as Follow-\n      Ups in MHonArc).  These are derived from the References header\n\
    \      field in the displayed message, and the In-Reply-To header field\n    \
    \  or the last value in the References header field of all other\n      messages\
    \ in the archive.\n   o  Make it possible to hide these navigation elements.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Message List UI
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Message List UI\n   It is not sufficiently obvious that the message list\
    \ panel can be\n   resized.  The current handle is not visually distinct enough\
    \ to\n   signal the capability to the user, leaving many users believing they\n\
    \   are restricted to the very short default list, even when viewing on\n   large\
    \ monitors.\n   Additionally, there is a flaw in the code that fetches additional\n\
    \   messages when scrolling to the bottom of what's currently displayed.\n   If\
    \ the message window is large enough that the default number of\n   results does\
    \ not fill it, no scrollbar appears, and scrolling to the\n   bottom does not\
    \ fetch additional results.\n   The filter by list and filter by from sections\
    \ to the left of the\n   message list have no values in many circumstances, but\
    \ it is not\n   obvious why they are missing.  One notable condition is when the\n\
    \   search result is very large -- computing the values to put in these\n   filters\
    \ becomes prohibitively expensive.  Without foreknowledge of\n   the decisions\
    \ captured in the code, the behavior seems arbitrary and\n   unintuitive.\n  \
    \ The current view truncates fields, leaving trailing ellipses, when it\n   doesn't\
    \ need to.  This leaves space underutilized on large displays\n   and may make\
    \ selection (particularly of long email addresses in the\n   filters) much more\
    \ difficult than it should be.  On small displays,\n   the column of filters dominates\
    \ the display, leaving only a small\n   amount of space for the actual message\
    \ content.\n   The current view requires the user to select each message in the\n\
    \   message list to get the URI to that message.  This makes it difficult\n  \
    \ to open several messages in different windows, or to build a list of\n   URIs\
    \ for use in a message or other applications.  It is also not\n   obvious that\
    \ double-clicking a row in the list will open the message\n   in a separate window.\n\
    \   This effort will:\n   o  Make the ability to resize the panels on the message\
    \ list display\n      easier to find.\n   o  Account for the size of the message\
    \ list panel when choosing how\n      many messages to fetch, filling the panel\
    \ whenever there are\n      enough results to do so.\n   o  Provide a message\
    \ explaining any condition leading to filter\n      values not being populated\
    \ (such as \"Refine search to enable\n      'From' filtering\").\n   o  Allow\
    \ subjects to fill the column on large displays.  Show fully\n      expanded list\
    \ and email addresses in the pop-ups for the filters.\n   o  Provide a link on\
    \ each row of the list to the URL for that row's\n      message.\n   o  Add an\
    \ export type that produces a file containing a list of URIs\n      to each message\
    \ in the list.\n   o  Add a hint to the UI that double-clicking on a row in the\
    \ list\n      will open a single-message view of the associated message in a\n\
    \      separate view.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Improve Support for Mobile Devices
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Improve Support for Mobile Devices\n   The current view becomes difficult\
    \ to use on small displays,\n   particularly phone displays in portrait mode.\
    \  This effort will:\n   o  Add a responsive interface, presenting a useful interface\
    \ on both\n      small and large displays.\n"
- title: 2.6.  Improve Use of Display Space
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Improve Use of Display Space\n   The current view underutilizes the available\
    \ display space.  This\n   effort will:\n   o  Make the message content the primary\
    \ point of each view.\n   o  Reduce the unused space on the display.\n   o  Remove\
    \ the filter column responsively when the display width is\n      small.\n"
- title: 2.7.  Use without JavaScript
  contents:
  - "2.7.  Use without JavaScript\n   The current web-based archive search tool requires\
    \ JavaScript to\n   function.  This effort will extend the tool to allow users\
    \ that have\n   disabled JavaScript in their browser to retrieve and navigate\
    \ through\n   search results using the message list and single message views.\n\
    \   This effort will not attempt to preserve all of the functionality\n   provided\
    \ with JavaScript enabled.  In particular, when running with\n   JavaScript disabled,\
    \ these features will not be available:\n   o  Resizing of the message list panels.\n\
    \   o  Dynamically filtering by time, list, or from.  (The filter column\n   \
    \   will not appear).\n"
- title: 2.8.  Administration
  contents:
  - "2.8.  Administration\n   This project will:\n   o  Add a link from the message\
    \ view to the admin page for the message\n      when logged in as an administrator.\n\
    \   o  Add correction of the appropriate thread indices to the handling\n    \
    \  of administrative imports of messages.\n   o  Implement a redirection handler\
    \ mapping legacy archive URLs to the\n      appropriate mailarch page.\n   o \
    \ Make the underlying template consistent across all views presented\n      by\
    \ the tool.  In particular, ensure that the correct logo as\n      designated\
    \ by the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC)\n      appears consistently\
    \ on all views.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   The requirements for improvement to the mailarch\
    \ tool captured in\n   this document do not introduce any exceptional security\n\
    \   considerations.  They add additional navigation points, and the\n   implementers\
    \ should consider the impact of rapid navigation using\n   these new mechanisms\
    \ (see the security considerations of [RFC6778]).\n"
