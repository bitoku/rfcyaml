- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) is a general term\n\
    \   that refers to a toolset for fault detection and isolation, and for\n   performance\
    \ measurement.  Over the years, various OAM tools have been\n   defined for various\
    \ layers in the protocol stack.\n   This document summarizes some of the OAM tools\
    \ defined in the IETF in\n   the context of IP unicast, MPLS, MPLS Transport Profile\
    \ (MPLS-TP),\n   pseudowires, and Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links\n\
    \   (TRILL).  This document focuses on tools for detecting and isolating\n   failures\
    \ in networks and for performance monitoring.  Control and\n   management aspects\
    \ of OAM are outside the scope of this document.\n   Network repair functions\
    \ such as Fast Reroute (FRR) and protection\n   switching, which are often triggered\
    \ by OAM protocols, are also out\n   of the scope of this document.\n   The target\
    \ audience of this document includes network equipment\n   vendors, network operators,\
    \ and standards development organizations.\n   This document can be used as an\
    \ index to some of the main OAM tools\n   defined in the IETF.  At the end of\
    \ the document, a list of the OAM\n   toolsets and a list of the OAM functions\
    \ are presented as a summary.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   \"OAM\" is a general term that refers to a toolset for detecting,\n\
    \   isolating, and reporting failures, and for monitoring network\n   performance.\n\
    \   There are several different interpretations of the \"OAM\" acronym.\n   This\
    \ document refers to Operations, Administration, and Maintenance,\n   as recommended\
    \ in Section 3 of [OAM-Def].\n   This document summarizes some of the OAM tools\
    \ defined in the IETF in\n   the context of IP unicast, MPLS, MPLS Transport Profile\
    \ (MPLS-TP),\n   pseudowires, and TRILL.\n   This document focuses on tools for\
    \ detecting and isolating failures\n   and for performance monitoring.  Hence,\
    \ this document focuses on the\n   tools used for monitoring and measuring the\
    \ data plane; control and\n   management aspects of OAM are outside the scope\
    \ of this document.\n   Network repair functions such as Fast Reroute (FRR) and\
    \ protection\n   switching, which are often triggered by OAM protocols, are also\
    \ out\n   of the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Background
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Background\n   OAM was originally used in traditional communication technologies\n\
    \   such as E1 and T1, evolving into Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy\n   (PDH)\
    \ and then later into Synchronous Optical Network / Synchronous\n   Digital Hierarchy\
    \ (SONET/SDH).  ATM was probably the first technology\n   to include inherent\
    \ OAM support from day one, while in other\n   technologies OAM was typically\
    \ defined in an ad hoc manner after the\n   technology was already defined and\
    \ deployed.  Packet-based networks\n   were traditionally considered unreliable\
    \ and best effort.  As packet-\n   based networks evolved, they have become the\
    \ common transport for\n   both data and telephony, replacing traditional transport\
    \ protocols.\n   Consequently, packet-based networks were expected to provide\
    \ a\n   similar \"carrier grade\" experience, and specifically to support more\n\
    \   advanced OAM functions, beyond ICMP and router hellos, that were\n   traditionally\
    \ used for fault detection.\n   As typical networks have a multi-layer architecture,\
    \ the set of OAM\n   protocols similarly take a multi-layer structure; each layer\
    \ has its\n   own OAM protocols.  Moreover, OAM can be used at different levels\
    \ of\n   hierarchy in the network to form a multi-layer OAM solution, as shown\n\
    \   in the example in Figure 1.\n   Figure 1 illustrates a network in which IP\
    \ traffic between two\n   customer edges is transported over an MPLS provider\
    \ network.  MPLS\n   OAM is used at the provider level for monitoring the connection\n\
    \   between the two provider edges, while IP OAM is used at the customer\n   level\
    \ for monitoring the end-to-end connection between the two\n   customer edges.\n\

- title: 1.4.  Focusing on the Data Plane
  contents:
  - "1.4.  Focusing on the Data Plane\n   OAM tools may, and quite often do, work\
    \ in conjunction with a control\n   plane and/or management plane.  OAM provides\
    \ instrumentation tools\n   for measuring and monitoring the data plane.  OAM\
    \ tools often use\n   control-plane functions, e.g., to initialize OAM sessions\
    \ and to\n   exchange various parameters.  The OAM tools communicate with the\n\
    \   management plane to raise alarms, and often OAM tools may be\n   activated\
    \ by the management plane (as well as by the control plane),\n   e.g., to locate\
    \ and localize problems.\n   The considerations of the control-plane maintenance\
    \ tools and the\n   functionality of the management plane are out of scope for\
    \ this\n   document, which concentrates on presenting the data-plane tools that\n\
    \   are used for OAM.  Network repair functions such as Fast Reroute\n   (FRR)\
    \ and protection switching, which are often triggered by OAM\n   protocols, are\
    \ also out of the scope of this document.\n   Since OAM protocols are used for\
    \ monitoring the data plane, it is\n   imperative for OAM tools to be capable\
    \ of testing the actual data\n   plane with as much accuracy as possible.  Thus,\
    \ it is important to\n   enforce fate-sharing between OAM traffic that monitors\
    \ the data plane\n   and the data-plane traffic it monitors.\n"

    \  established (by a control protocol or provisioned by a management\n      system)\
    \ prior to the transmission of data.\n      Typically a connection identifier\
    \ is used to identify the\n      connection.  In connection-oriented technologies,\
    \ it is often the\n      case (although not always) that all packets belonging\
    \ to a\n      specific connection use the same route through the network.\n  \
    \ Connectionless\n      In connectionless technologies, data is typically sent\
    \ between end\n      points without prior arrangement.  Packets are routed\n \
    \     independently based on their destination address, and hence\n      different\
    \ packets may be routed in a different way across the\n      network.\n   Discussion\n\
    \      The OAM tools described in this document include tools that\n      support\
    \ connection-oriented technologies, as well as tools for\n      connectionless\
    \ technologies.\n      In connection-oriented technologies, OAM is used to monitor\

    \      route as the data traffic and receive the same treatment.  In\n      connectionless\
    \ technologies, OAM is used between a source and\n      destination pair without\
    \ defining a specific connection.\n      Moreover, in some cases, the route of\
    \ OAM packets may differ from\n      the one of the data traffic.  For example,\
    \ the connectionless IP\n      Ping (Section 4.1) tests the reachability from\
    \ a source to a given\n      destination, while the connection-oriented LSP Ping\
    \ (Section\n      4.4.1) is used for monitoring a specific LSP (connection) and\n\
    \      provides the capability to monitor all the available paths used by\n  \
    \    an LSP.\n      It should be noted that in some cases connectionless protocols\
    \ are\n      monitored by connection-oriented OAM protocols.  For example,\n \
    \     while IP is a connectionless protocol, it can be monitored by BFD\n    \

- title: 4.1.  IP Ping
  contents:
  - "4.1.  IP Ping\n   Ping is a common network diagnostic application for IP networks\
    \ that\n   use ICMP.  According to [NetTerms], 'Ping' is an abbreviation for\n\
    \   Packet internet groper, although the term has been so commonly used\n   that\
    \ it stands on its own.  As defined in [NetTerms], it is a program\n   used to\
    \ test reachability of destinations by sending them an ICMP\n   Echo request and\
    \ waiting for a reply.\n   The ICMP Echo request/reply exchange in Ping is used\
    \ as a Continuity\n   Check function for the Internet Protocol.  The originator\
    \ transmits\n   an ICMP Echo request packet, and the receiver replies with an\
    \ Echo\n   reply.  ICMP Ping is defined in two variants: [ICMPv4] is used for\n\
    \   IPv4, and [ICMPv6] is used for IPv6.\n   Ping can be invoked to either a unicast\
    \ destination or a multicast\n   destination.  In the latter case, all members\
    \ of the multicast group\n   send an Echo reply back to the originator.\n   Ping\
    \ implementations typically use ICMP messages.  UDP Ping is a\n   variant that\
    \ uses UDP messages instead of ICMP Echo messages.\n   Ping is a single-ended\
    \ Continuity Check, i.e., it allows the\n   *initiator* of the Echo request to\
    \ test the reachability.  If it is\n   desirable for both ends to test the reachability,\
    \ both ends have to\n   invoke Ping independently.\n   Note that since ICMP filtering\
    \ is deployed in some routers and\n   firewalls, the usefulness of Ping is sometimes\
    \ limited in the wider\n   Internet.  This limitation is equally relevant to Traceroute.\n"
- title: 4.2.  IP Traceroute
  contents:
  - "4.2.  IP Traceroute\n   Traceroute ([TCPIP-Tools], [NetTools]) is an application\
    \ that allows\n   users to discover a path between an IP source and an IP destination.\n\
    \   The most common way to implement Traceroute [TCPIP-Tools] is\n   described\
    \ as follows.  Traceroute sends a sequence of UDP packets to\n   UDP port 33434\
    \ at the destination.  By default, Traceroute begins by\n   sending three packets\
    \ (the number of packets is configurable in most\n   Traceroute implementations),\
    \ each with an IP Time-To-Live (or Hop\n   Limit in IPv6) value of one, to the\
    \ destination.  These packets\n   expire as soon as they reach the first router\
    \ in the path.\n   Consequently, that router sends three ICMP Time Exceeded Messages\n\
    \   back to the Traceroute application.  Traceroute now sends another\n   three\
    \ UDP packets, each with the TTL value of 2.  These messages\n   cause the second\
    \ router to return ICMP messages.  This process\n   continues, with ever-increasing\
    \ values for the TTL field, until the\n   packets actually reach the destination.\
    \  Because no application\n   listens to port 33434 at the destination, the destination\
    \ returns\n   ICMP Destination Unreachable Messages indicating an unreachable\
    \ port.\n   This event indicates to the Traceroute application that it is\n  \
    \ finished.  The Traceroute program displays the round-trip delay\n   associated\
    \ with each of the attempts.\n   While Traceroute is a tool that finds *a* path\
    \ from A to B, it should\n   be noted that traffic from A to B is often forwarded\
    \ through Equal-\n   Cost Multipaths (ECMPs).  Paris Traceroute [PARIS] is an\
    \ extension to\n   Traceroute that attempts to discovers all the available paths\
    \ from A\n   to B by scanning different values of header fields (such as UDP\n\
    \   ports) in the probe packets.\n   It is noted that Traceroute is an application,\
    \ and not a protocol.\n   As such, it has various different implementations. \
    \ One of the most\n   common ones uses UDP probe packets, as described above.\
    \  Other\n   implementations exist that use other types of probe messages, such\
    \ as\n   ICMP or TCP.\n   Note that IP routing may be asymmetric.  While Traceroute\
    \ discovers a\n   path between a source and destination, it does not reveal the\
    \ reverse\n   path.\n   A few ICMP extensions ([ICMP-MP], [ICMP-Int]) have been\
    \ defined in\n   the context of Traceroute.  These documents define several\n\
    \   extensions, including extensions to the ICMP Destination Unreachable\n   message,\
    \ that can be used by Traceroute applications.\n   Traceroute allows path discovery\
    \ to *unicast* destination addresses.\n   A similar tool [mtrace] was defined\
    \ for multicast destination\n   addresses; it allows tracing the route that a\
    \ multicast IP packet\n   takes from a source to a particular receiver.\n"

    \ BFD Control\n   packets that are exchanged within a BFD session.  BFD sessions\n\
    \   operate in one of two modes:\n   o  Asynchronous mode (i.e., proactive): in\
    \ this mode, BFD Control\n      packets are sent periodically.  When the receiver\
    \ detects that no\n      BFD Control packets have been received during a predetermined\n\
    \      period of time, a failure is reported.\n   o  Demand mode: in this mode,\
    \ BFD Control packets are sent on demand.\n      Upon need, a system initiates\
    \ a series of BFD Control packets to\n      check the continuity of the session.\
    \  BFD Control packets are sent\n      independently in each direction.\n   Each\
    \ of the endpoints (referred to as systems) of the monitored path\n   maintains\

    \ during the session.\n   During normal operation of the session, i.e., when no\
    \ failures have\n   been detected, the BFD session is in the Up state.  If no\

  contents:
  - "4.4.1.  LSP Ping\n   LSP Ping is modeled after the Ping/Traceroute paradigm,\
    \ and thus it\n   may be used in one of two modes:\n   o  \"Ping\" mode: In this\
    \ mode, LSP Ping is used for end-to-end\n      Connectivity Verification between\
    \ two LERs.\n   o  \"Traceroute\" mode: This mode is used for hop-by-hop fault\n\
    \      isolation.\n   LSP Ping is based on the ICMP Ping operation (of data-plane\n\
    \   Connectivity Verification) with additional functionality to verify\n   data-plane\
    \ vs. control-plane consistency for a Forwarding Equivalence\n   Class (FEC) and\
    \ also to identify Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)\n   problems.\n   The Traceroute\
    \ functionality may be used to isolate and localize MPLS\n   faults, using the\
    \ Time-To-Live (TTL) indicator to incrementally\n   identify the sub-path of the\
    \ LSP that is successfully traversed\n   before the faulty link or node.\n   The\
    \ challenge in MPLS networks is that the traffic of a given LSP may\n   be load-balanced\
    \ across Equal-Cost Multipaths (ECMPs).  LSP Ping\n   monitors all the available\
    \ paths of an LSP by monitoring its\n   different FECs.  Note that MPLS-TP does\
    \ not use ECMP, and thus does\n   not require OAM over multiple paths.\n   Another\
    \ challenge is that an MPLS LSP does not necessarily have a\n   return path; traffic\
    \ that is sent back from the egress LSR to the\n   ingress LSR is not necessarily\
    \ sent over an MPLS LSP, but it can be\n   sent through a different route, such\
    \ as an IP route.  Thus,\n   responding to an LSP Ping message is not necessarily\
    \ as trivial as in\n   IP Ping, where the responder just swaps the source and\
    \ destination IP\n   addresses.  Note that this challenge is not applicable to\
    \ MPLS-TP,\n   where a return path is always available.\n   It should be noted\
    \ that LSP Ping supports unique identification of\n   the LSP within an addressing\
    \ domain.  The identification is checked\n   using the full FEC identification.\
    \  LSP Ping is extensible to include\n   additional information needed to support\
    \ new functionality, by use of\n   Type-Length-Value (TLV) constructs.  The usage\
    \ of TLVs is typically\n   handled by the control plane, as it is not easy to\
    \ implement in\n   hardware.\n   LSP Ping supports both asynchronous and on-demand\
    \ activation.\n"

  - "4.5.1.  Overview\n   The MPLS working group has defined the OAM toolset that\
    \ fulfills the\n   requirements for MPLS-TP OAM.  The full set of requirements\
    \ for\n   MPLS-TP OAM are defined in [MPLS-TP-OAM] and include both general\n\
    \   requirements for the behavior of the OAM tools and a set of\n   operations\
    \ that should be supported by the OAM toolset.  The set of\n   mechanisms required\
    \ are further elaborated in [TP-OAM-FW], which\n   describes the general architecture\
    \ of the OAM system and also gives\n   overviews of the functionality of the OAM\
    \ toolset.\n   Some of the basic requirements for the OAM toolset for MPLS-TP\
    \ are:\n   o  MPLS-TP OAM must be able to support both an IP-based environment\n\
    \      and a non-IP-based environment.  If the network is IP based, i.e.,\n  \
    \    IP routing and forwarding are available, then the MPLS-TP OAM\n      toolset\
    \ should rely on the IP routing and forwarding capabilities.\n      On the other\
    \ hand, in environments where IP functionality is not\n      available, the OAM\
    \ tools must still be able to operate without\n      dependence on IP forwarding\
    \ and routing.\n   o  OAM packets and the user traffic are required to be congruent\n\
    \      (i.e., OAM packets are transmitted in-band), and there is a need\n    \
    \  to differentiate OAM packets from ordinary user packets in the\n      data\
    \ plane.  Inherent in this requirement is the principle that\n      MPLS-TP OAM\
    \ be independent of any existing control plane, although\n      it should not\
    \ preclude use of the control-plane functionality.\n      OAM packets are identified\
    \ by the Generic Associated Channel Label\n      (GAL), which is a reserved MPLS\
    \ label value (13).\n"
- title: 4.5.2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "4.5.2.  Terminology\n   Maintenance Entity (ME)\n      The MPLS-TP OAM tools\
    \ are designed to monitor and manage a\n      Maintenance Entity (ME).  An ME,\
    \ as defined in [TP-OAM-FW],\n      defines a relationship between two points\
    \ of a transport path to\n      which maintenance and monitoring operations apply.\n\
    \      The term \"Maintenance Entity (ME)\" is used in ITU-T\n      Recommendations\
    \ (e.g., [ITU-T-Y1731]), as well as in the MPLS-TP\n      terminology ([TP-OAM-FW]).\n\
    \   Maintenance Entity Group (MEG)\n      The collection of one or more MEs that\
    \ belong to the same\n      transport path and that are maintained and monitored\
    \ as a group\n      are known as a Maintenance Entity Group (based on [TP-OAM-FW]).\n\
    \   Maintenance Point (MP)\n      A Maintenance Point (MP) is a functional entity\
    \ that is defined at\n      a node in the network and can initiate and/or react\
    \ to OAM\n      messages.  This document focuses on the data-plane functionality\n\
    \      of MPs, while MPs interact with the control plane and with the\n      management\
    \ plane as well.\n      The term \"MP\" is used in IEEE 802.1ag and was similarly\
    \ adopted in\n      MPLS-TP ([TP-OAM-FW]).\n   MEG End Point (MEP)\n      A MEG\
    \ End Point (MEP) is one of the endpoints of an ME, and can\n      initiate OAM\
    \ messages and respond to them (based on [TP-OAM-FW]).\n   MEG Intermediate Point\
    \ (MIP)\n      In between MEPs, there are zero or more intermediate points,\n\
    \      called MEG Intermediate Points  (based on [TP-OAM-FW]).\n      A MEG Intermediate\
    \ Point (MIP) is an intermediate point that does\n      not generally initiate\
    \ OAM frames (one exception to this is the\n      use of AIS notifications) but\
    \ is able to respond to OAM frames\n      that are destined to it.  A MIP in MPLS-TP\
    \ identifies OAM packets\n      destined to it by the expiration of the TTL field\
    \ in the OAM\n      packet.  The term \"Maintenance Point\" is a general term\
    \ for MEPs\n      and MIPs.\n   Up and Down MEPs\n      IEEE 802.1ag [IEEE802.1Q]\
    \ defines a distinction between Up MEPs\n      and Down MEPs.  A MEP monitors\
    \ traffic in either the direction\n      facing the network or the direction facing\
    \ the bridge.  A Down MEP\n      is a MEP that receives OAM packets from and transmits\
    \ them to the\n      direction of the network.  An Up MEP receives OAM packets\
    \ from and\n      transmits them to the direction of the bridging entity.  MPLS-TP\n\
    \      ([TP-OAM-FW]) uses a similar distinction on the placement of the\n    \
    \  MEP -- at either the ingress, egress, or forwarding function of\n      the\
    \ node (Down / Up MEPs).  This placement is important for\n      localization\
    \ of a failure.\n      Note that the terms \"Up MEP\" and \"Down MEP\" are entirely\
    \ unrelated\n      to the conventional \"Up\"/\"Down\" terminology, where \"Down\"\
    \ means\n      faulty and \"Up\" means not faulty.\n      The distinction between\
    \ Up and Down MEPs was defined in\n      [TP-OAM-FW], but has not been used in\
    \ other MPLS-TP RFCs, as of\n      the writing of this document.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.5.3.  Generic Associated Channel\n   In order to address the requirement for\
    \ in-band transmission of\n   MPLS-TP OAM traffic, MPLS-TP uses a Generic Associated\
    \ Channel\n   (G-ACh), defined in [G-ACh] for LSP-based OAM traffic.  This\n \
    \  mechanism is based on the same concepts as the PWE3 ACH [PW-ACH] and\n   VCCV\
    \ [VCCV] mechanisms.  However, to address the needs of LSPs as\n   differentiated\
    \ from PW, the following concepts were defined for\n   [G-ACh]:\n   o  An Associated\
    \ Channel Header (ACH), which uses a format similar to\n      the PW Control Word\
    \ [PW-ACH], is a 4-byte header that is prepended\n      to OAM packets.\n   o\
    \  A Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL).  The GAL is a reserved\n      MPLS\
    \ label value (13) that indicates that the packet is an ACH\n      packet and\
    \ the payload follows immediately after the label stack.\n   It should be noted\
    \ that while the G-ACh was defined as part of the\n   MPLS-TP definition effort,\
    \ the G-ACh is a generic tool that can be\n   used in MPLS in general, and not\

    \  also referred to as \"PWE3 Control Word with 0001b as first\n      nibble\"\
    .  It uses the PW Associated Channel Header [PW-ACH].\n   o  Control Channel Type\
    \ 2: Out-of-band VCCV, as described in [VCCV],\n      is also referred to as \"\

- title: 4.7.1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "4.7.1.  Overview\n   The IPPM working group in the IETF defines common criteria\
    \ and\n   metrics for measuring performance of IP traffic ([IPPM-FW]).  Some of\n\
    \   the key RFCs published by this working group have defined metrics for\n  \
    \ measuring connectivity [IPPM-Con], delay ([IPPM-1DM], [IPPM-2DM]),\n   and packet\
    \ loss [IPPM-1LM].  It should be noted that the work of the\n   IETF in the context\
    \ of performance metrics is not limited to IP\n   networks; [PM-CONS] presents\
    \ general guidelines for considering new\n   performance metrics.\n   The IPPM\
    \ working group has defined not only metrics for performance\n   measurement but\
    \ also protocols that define how the measurement is\n   carried out.  The One-Way\
    \ Active Measurement Protocol [OWAMP] and the\n   Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol\
    \ [TWAMP] each define a method and\n   protocol for measuring performance metrics\
    \ in IP networks.\n   OWAMP [OWAMP] enables measurement of one-way characteristics\
    \ of IP\n   networks, such as one-way packet loss and one-way delay.  For its\n\
    \   proper operation, OWAMP requires accurate time-of-day setting at its\n   endpoints.\n\
    \   TWAMP [TWAMP] is a similar protocol that enables measurement of both\n   one-way\
    \ and two-way (round-trip) characteristics.\n   OWAMP and TWAMP are each comprised\
    \ of two separate protocols:\n   o  OWAMP-Control/TWAMP-Control: used to initiate,\
    \ start, and stop\n      test sessions and to fetch their results.  Continuity\
    \ Check and\n      Connectivity Verification are tested and confirmed by establishing\n\
    \      the OWAMP/TWAMP Control Protocol TCP connection.\n   o  OWAMP-Test/TWAMP-Test:\
    \ used to exchange test packets between two\n      measurement nodes.  Enables\
    \ the loss and delay measurement\n      functions, as well as detection of other\
    \ anomalies, such as packet\n      duplication and packet reordering.\n   It should\
    \ be noted that while [OWAMP] and [TWAMP] define tools for\n   performance measurement,\
    \ they do not define the accuracy of these\n   tools.  The accuracy depends on\
    \ scale, implementation, and network\n   configurations.\n   Alternative protocols\
    \ for performance monitoring are defined, for\n   example, in MPLS-TP OAM ([MPLS-LM-DM],\
    \ [TP-LM-DM]) and in Ethernet\n   OAM [ITU-T-Y1731].\n"
- title: 4.7.2.  Control and Test Protocols
  contents:
  - "4.7.2.  Control and Test Protocols\n   OWAMP and TWAMP control protocols run\
    \ over TCP, while the test\n   protocols run over UDP.  The purpose of the control\
    \ protocols is to\n   initiate, start, and stop test sessions, and for OWAMP to\
    \ fetch\n   results.  The test protocols introduce test packets (which contain\n\
    \   sequence numbers and timestamps) along the IP path under test\n   according\
    \ to a schedule, and they record statistics of packet\n   arrival.  Multiple sessions\
    \ may be simultaneously defined, each with\n   a session identifier, and defining\
    \ the number of packets to be sent,\n   the amount of padding to be added (and\
    \ thus the packet size), the\n   start time, and the send schedule (which can\
    \ be either a constant\n   time between test packets or exponentially distributed\n\
    \   pseudorandomly).  Statistics recorded conform to the relevant IPPM\n   RFCs.\n\
    \   From a security perspective, OWAMP and TWAMP test packets are hard to\n  \
    \ detect because they are simply UDP streams between negotiated port\n   numbers,\
    \ with potentially nothing static in the packets.  OWAMP and\n   TWAMP also include\
    \ optional authentication and encryption for both\n   control and test packets.\n"
- title: 4.7.3.  OWAMP
  contents:
  - "4.7.3.  OWAMP\n   OWAMP defines the following logical roles: Session-Sender,\n\
    \   Session-Receiver, Server, Control-Client, and Fetch-Client.  The\n   Session-Sender\
    \ originates test traffic that is received by the\n   Session-Receiver.  The Server\
    \ configures and manages the session, as\n   well as returning the results.  The\
    \ Control-Client initiates requests\n   for test sessions, triggers their start,\
    \ and may trigger their\n   termination.  The Fetch-Client requests the results\
    \ of a completed\n   session.  Multiple roles may be combined in a single host\
    \ -- for\n   example, one host may play the roles of Control-Client, Fetch-Client,\n\
    \   and Session-Sender, and a second may play the roles of Server and\n   Session-Receiver.\n\
    \   In a typical OWAMP session, the Control-Client establishes a TCP\n   connection\
    \ to port 861 of the Server, which responds with a Server\n   greeting message\
    \ indicating supported security/integrity modes.  The\n   Control-Client responds\
    \ with the chosen communications mode, and the\n   Server accepts the mode.  The\
    \ Control-Client then requests and fully\n   describes a test session to which\
    \ the Server responds with its\n   acceptance and supporting information.  More\
    \ than one test session\n   may be requested with additional messages.  The Control-Client\
    \ then\n   starts a test session; the Server acknowledges and then instructs the\n\
    \   Session-Sender to start the test.  The Session-Sender then sends test\n  \
    \ packets with pseudorandom padding to the Session-Receiver until the\n   session\
    \ is complete or until the Control-Client stops the session.\n   Once finished,\
    \ the Session-Sender reports to the Server, which\n   recovers data from the Session-Receiver.\
    \  The Fetch-Client can then\n   send a fetch request to the Server, which responds\
    \ with an\n   acknowledgement and, immediately thereafter, the result data.\n"

    \ OWAMP roles, except that the Session-Reflector does not collect\n   any packet\
    \ information, and there is no need for a Fetch-Client.\n   In a typical TWAMP\
    \ session, the Control-Client establishes a TCP\n   connection to port 862 of\
    \ the Server, and the mode is negotiated as\n   in OWAMP.  The Control-Client\

  - "4.8.  TRILL\n   The requirements of OAM in TRILL are defined in [TRILL-OAM].\
    \  The\n   challenge in TRILL OAM, much like in MPLS networks, is that traffic\n\
    \   between RBridges RB1 and RB2 may be forwarded through more than one\n   path.\
    \  Thus, an OAM protocol between RBridges RB1 and RB2 must be\n   able to monitor\
    \ all the available paths between the two RBridges.\n   During the writing of\
    \ this document, the detailed definition of the\n   TRILL OAM tools is still work\
    \ in progress.  This subsection presents\n   the main requirements of TRILL OAM.\n\
    \   The main requirements defined in [TRILL-OAM] are:\n   o  Continuity Checking\
    \ (CC) - the TRILL OAM protocol must support a\n      function for CC between\
    \ any two RBridges RB1 and RB2.\n   o  Connectivity Verification (CV) - connectivity\
    \ between two RBridges\n      RB1 and RB2 can be verified on a per-flow basis.\n\
    \   o  Path Tracing - allows an RBridge to trace all the available paths\n   \
    \   to a peer RBridge.\n   o  Performance monitoring - allows an RBridge to monitor\

- title: 5.3.  Guidance to Network Equipment Vendors
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Guidance to Network Equipment Vendors\n   As mentioned in Section 1.4,\
    \ it is imperative for OAM tools to be\n   capable of testing the actual data\
    \ plane with as much accuracy as\n   possible.  While this guideline may appear\
    \ obvious, it is worthwhile\n   to emphasize the key importance of enforcing fate-sharing\
    \ between OAM\n   traffic that monitors the data plane and the data-plane traffic\
    \ it\n   monitors.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   OAM is tightly coupled with the stability of\
    \ the network.  A\n   successful attack on an OAM protocol can create a false\
    \ illusion of\n   nonexistent failures or prevent the detection of actual ones.\
    \  In\n   both cases, the attack may result in denial of service.\n   Some of\
    \ the OAM tools presented in this document include security\n   mechanisms that\
    \ provide integrity protection, thereby preventing\n   attackers from forging\
    \ or tampering with OAM packets.  For example,\n   [BFD] includes an optional\
    \ authentication mechanism for BFD Control\n   packets, using either SHA1, MD5,\
    \ or a simple password.  [OWAMP] and\n   [TWAMP] have three modes of security:\
    \ unauthenticated, authenticated,\n   and encrypted.  The authentication uses\
    \ SHA1 as the HMAC algorithm,\n   and the encrypted mode uses AES encryption.\n\
    \   Confidentiality is typically not considered a requirement for OAM\n   protocols.\
    \  However, the use of encryption (e.g., [OWAMP] and\n   [TWAMP]) can make it\
    \ difficult for attackers to identify OAM packets,\n   thus making it more difficult\
    \ to attack the OAM protocol.\n   OAM can also be used as a means for network\
    \ reconnaissance;\n   information about addresses, port numbers, and the network\
    \ topology\n   and performance can be gathered by either passively eavesdropping\
    \ on\n   OAM packets or actively sending OAM packets and gathering information\n\
    \   from the respective responses.  This information can then be used\n   maliciously\
    \ to attack the network.  Note that some of this\n   information, e.g., addresses\
    \ and port numbers, can be gathered even\n   when encryption is used ([OWAMP],\
    \ [TWAMP]).\n   For further details about the security considerations of each\
    \ OAM\n   protocol, the reader is encouraged to review the Security\n   Considerations\
    \ section of each document referenced by this memo.\n"

    \ produced by the IETF.\n   It is important to note that the table lists various\
    \ RFCs that are\n   different by nature.  For example, some of these documents\
    \ define OAM\n   tools or OAM protocols (or both), while others define protocols\
    \ that\n   are not strictly OAM related, but are used by OAM tools.  The table\n\
    \   also includes RFCs that define the requirements or the framework of\n   OAM\
    \ in a specific context (e.g., MPLS-TP).\n   The RFCs in the table are categorized\
    \ in a few sets as defined in\n   Section 1.3.\n   +-----------+--------------------------------------+----------+\n\

  - "A.2.  List of Selected Non-IETF OAM Documents\n   In addition to the OAM tools\
    \ defined by the IETF, the IEEE and ITU-T\n   have also defined various OAM tools\
    \ that focus on Ethernet and\n   various other transport-network environments.\
    \  These various tools,\n   defined by the three standard organizations, are often\
    \ tightly\n   coupled and have had a mutual effect on each other.  The ITU-T and\n\
    \   IETF have both defined OAM tools for MPLS LSPs, [ITU-T-Y1711], and\n   [LSP-Ping].\
    \  The following OAM standards by the IEEE and ITU-T are to\n   some extent linked\
    \ to the IETF OAM tools listed above and are\n   mentioned here only as reference\
    \ material.\n   o  OAM tools for Layer 2 have been defined by the ITU-T in\n \
    \     [ITU-T-Y1731] and by the IEEE in 802.1ag [IEEE802.1Q].  The IEEE\n     \
    \ 802.3 standard defines OAM for one-hop Ethernet links\n      [IEEE802.3ah].\n\
    \   o  The ITU-T has defined OAM for MPLS LSPs in [ITU-T-Y1711] and for\n    \
    \  MPLS-TP OAM in [ITU-G8113.1] and [ITU-G8113.2].\n   It should be noted that\
    \ these non-IETF documents deal in many cases\n   with OAM functions below the\
    \ IP layer (Layer 2, Layer 2.5) and that\n   in some cases operators use a multi-layered\
    \ OAM approach, which is a\n   function of the way their networks are designed.\n\
    \   Table 6 summarizes some of the main OAM standards published by\n   non-IETF\
    \ standard organizations.  This document focuses on IETF OAM\n   standards, but\
    \ these non-IETF standards are referenced in this\n   document where relevant.\n\
