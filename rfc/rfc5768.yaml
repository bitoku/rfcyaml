    \   tag allows a User Agent (UA) to communicate to its registrar that it\n   supports\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 3264 [RFC3264] defines a two-phase exchange of Session\n\
    \   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] messages for the purposes of\n   establishment\
    \ of multimedia sessions.  This offer/answer mechanism is\n   used by protocols\
    \ such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\n   [RFC3261].\n   Protocols using\
    \ offer/answer are difficult to operate through Network\n   Address Translators\
    \ (NAT).  Because their purpose is to establish a\n   flow of media packets, they\
    \ tend to carry IP addresses within their\n   messages, which is known to be problematic\
    \ through NAT [RFC3235].  To\n   remedy this, an extension to SDP, called Interactive\
    \ Connectivity\n   Establishment (ICE) has been defined [RFC5245].  ICE defines\n\
    \   procedures by which agents gather a multiplicity of addresses,\n   include\
    \ all of them in an SDP offer or answer, and then use peer-to-\n   peer Session\
    \ Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) [RFC5389]\n   connectivity checks to determine\
    \ a valid address.\n   This specification defines a media feature tag, \"sip.ice\"\
    , and a SIP\n   option tag, \"ice\", that can be used by SIP User Agents that\
    \ make use\n   of ICE.  Section 3 motivates the need for the media feature tag\
    \ and\n   option tag, and Section 4 and Section 5 formally define them.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "3.  Motivation\n   There are two primary motivations for defining an option tag\
    \ and a\n   media feature tag.  They are support for gateways, and requiring ICE\n\
    \   for a call.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Gateways
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Gateways\n   Unfortunately, ICE requires both endpoints to support it in\
    \ order for\n   it to be used.  Within a domain, there will typically be User\
    \ Agents\n   that do and do not support ICE.  In order to facilitate deployment\
    \ of\n   ICE, it is anticipated that domains will make use of gateways that\n\
    \   act as ICE agents on one side, and non-ICE agents on the other side.\n   This\
    \ would allow a call from domain A into domain B to make use of\n   ICE, even\
    \ if the device in domain B does not itself yet support ICE.\n   However, when\
    \ domain B receives a call, it will need to know whether\n   the call needs to\
    \ pass through such a gateway, or whether it can go\n   to the terminating UA\
    \ directly.\n   In order to make such a determination, this specification defines\
    \ a\n   media feature tag, \"sip.ice\", which can be included in the Contact\n\
    \   header field of a REGISTER request [RFC3840].  This allows the\n   registrar\
    \ to track whether or not a UA supports ICE.  This\n   information can be accessed\
    \ by a proxy in order to determine whether\n   or not a call needs to route through\
    \ a gateway.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Mandating Support for ICE
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Mandating Support for ICE\n   Although ICE provides a built in fall back\
    \ to non-ICE operation when\n   the answerer doesn't support it, there are cases\
    \ where the offerer\n   would rather abort the call rather than proceed without\
    \ ICE.\n   Typically, this is because they would like to choose a different m/c-\n\
    \   line address for a non-ICE peer than they would for an ICE capable\n   peer.\n\
    \   To do this, the \"ice\" SIP option tag can be included in the Require\n  \
    \ header field of an INVITE request.\n"
- title: 4.  Media Feature Tag Definition
  contents:
  - "4.  Media Feature Tag Definition\n   The \"sip.ice\" media feature tag indicates\
    \ support for ICE.  An agent\n   supports ICE if it is either a lite or full implementation,\
    \ and\n   consequently, is capable of including candidate attributes in an SDP\n\
    \   offer or answer for at least one transport protocol.  An agent that\n   supports\
    \ ICE SHOULD include this media feature tag in the Contact\n   header field of\
    \ its REGISTER requests and OPTION responses.\n   An agent MAY include the media\
    \ feature tag in the Contact header\n   field of an INVITE or INVITE response;\
    \ however, doing so is redundant\n   with ICE attributes in the SDP that indicate\
    \ the same thing.  In\n   cases where an INVITE omits an offer, the lack or presence\
    \ of the\n   media feature tag in the Contact header field cannot be used by the\n\
    \   callee (which will be the offerer) to determine whether the caller\n   supports\
    \ ICE.  In cases of third-party call control [RFC3725], the\n   caller may be\
    \ a controller that does (or doesn't) support ICE, while\n   the answerer may\
    \ be an agent that does (or doesn't) support ICE.\n"
- title: 5.  Option Tag Definition
  contents:
  - "5.  Option Tag Definition\n   This \"ice\" OPTION tag SHOULD NOT be used in conjunction\
    \ with the\n   Supported header field (this SHOULD NOT include responses to OPTION\n\
    \   requests).  The media feature tag is used as the one and only\n   mechanism\
    \ for indicating support for ICE.  The option tag is meant to\n   be used only\
    \ with the Require header field.  When placed in the\n   Require header field\
    \ of an INVITE request, it indicates that the User\n   Agent Server (UAS) must\
    \ support ICE in order to process the call.  An\n   agent supports ICE if it is\
    \ either a full or lite implementation, and\n   consequently, is capable of including\
    \ candidate attributes in an SDP\n   offer or answer for at least one transport\
    \ protocol.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   A malicious intermediary might attempt to modify\
    \ a SIP message by\n   inserting a Require header field containing the \"ice\"\
    \ option tag.  If\n   ICE were not supported on the UAS, this would cause the\
    \ call to fail\n   when it would otherwise succeed.  Of course, this attack is\
    \ not\n   specific to ICE, and can be done using any option tag.  This attack\n\
    \   is prevented by usage of the SIPS mechanism as defined in RFC 3261.\n   Similarly,\
    \ an intermediary might attempt to remove the media feature\n   tag from a REGISTER\
    \ request or OPTIONS request, which might cause a\n   call to skip ICE processing\
    \ when it otherwise might make use of it.\n   This attack is also prevented using\
    \ the SIPS mechanism.\n"
