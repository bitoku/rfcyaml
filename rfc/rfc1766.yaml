  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a language tag for use in cases where it\
    \ is\n   desired to indicate the language used in an information object.\n   It\
    \ also defines a Content-language: header, for use in the case where\n   one desires\
    \ to indicate the language of something that has RFC-822-\n   like headers, like\
    \ MIME body parts or Web documents, and a new\n   parameter to the Multipart/Alternative\
    \ type, to aid in the usage of\n   the Content-Language: header.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   There are a number of languages spoken by human beings in\
    \ this world.\n   A great number of these people would prefer to have information\n\
    \   presented in a language that they understand.\n   In some contexts, it is\
    \ possible to have information in more than one\n   language, or it might be possible\
    \ to provide tools for assisting in\n   the understanding of a language (like\
    \ dictionaries).\n   A prerequisite for any such function is a means of labelling\
    \ the\n   information content with an identifier for the language in which is\n\
    \   is written.\n   In the tradition of solving only problems that we think we\n\
    \   understand, this document specifies an identifier mechanism, and one\n   possible\
    \ use for it.\n"
- title: 2.  The Language tag
  contents:
  - "2.  The Language tag\n   The language tag is composed of 1 or more parts: A primary\
    \ language\n   tag and a (possibly empty) series of subtags.\n   The syntax of\
    \ this tag in RFC-822 EBNF is:\n    Language-Tag = Primary-tag *( \"-\" Subtag\
    \ )\n    Primary-tag = 1*8ALPHA\n    Subtag = 1*8ALPHA\n   Whitespace is not allowed\
    \ within the tag.\n   All tags are to be treated as case insensitive; there exist\n\
    \   conventions for capitalization of some of them, but these should not\n   be\
    \ taken to carry meaning.\n   The namespace of language tags is administered by\
    \ the IANA according\n   to the rules in section 5 of this document.\n   The following\
    \ registrations are predefined:\n   In the primary language tag:\n    -    All\
    \ 2-letter tags are interpreted according to ISO standard\n         639, \"Code\
    \ for the representation of names of languages\" [ISO\n         639].\n    - \
    \   The value \"i\" is reserved for IANA-defined registrations\n    -    The value\
    \ \"x\" is reserved for private use. Subtags of \"x\"\n         will not be registered\
    \ by the IANA.\n    -    Other values cannot be assigned except by updating this\n\
    \         standard.\n   The reason for reserving all other tags is to be open\
    \ towards new\n   revisions of ISO 639; the use of \"i\" and \"x\" is the minimum\
    \ we can do\n   here to be able to extend the mechanism to meet our requirements.\n\
    \   In the first subtag:\n    -    All 2-letter codes are interpreted as ISO 3166\
    \ alpha-2\n         country codes denoting the area in which the language is\n\
    \         used.\n    -    Codes of 3 to 8 letters may be registered with the IANA\
    \ by\n         anyone who feels a need for it, according to the rules in\n   \
    \      chapter 5 of this document.\n   The information in the subtag may for instance\
    \ be:\n    -    Country identification, such as en-US (this usage is\n       \
    \  described in ISO 639)\n    -    Dialect or variant information, such as no-nynorsk\
    \ or en-\n         cockney\n    -    Languages not listed in ISO 639 that are\
    \ not variants of\n         any listed language, which can be registered with\
    \ the i-\n         prefix, such as i-cherokee\n    -    Script variations, such\
    \ as az-arabic and az-cyrillic\n   In the second and subsequent subtag, any value\
    \ can be registered.\n   NOTE: The ISO 639/ISO 3166 convention is that language\
    \ names are\n   written in lower case, while country codes are written in upper\
    \ case.\n   This convention is recommended, but not enforced; the tags are case\n\
    \   insensitive.\n   NOTE: ISO 639 defines a registration authority for additions\
    \ to and\n   changes in the list of languages in ISO 639. This authority is:\n\

- title: 2.1.  Meaning of the language tag
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Meaning of the language tag\n   The language tag always defines a language\
    \ as spoken (or written) by\n   human beings for communication of information\
    \ to other human beings.\n   Computer languages are explicitly excluded.\n   There\
    \ is no guaranteed relationship between languages whose tags\n   start out with\
    \ the same series of subtags; especially, they are NOT\n   guraranteed to be mutually\
    \ comprehensible, although this will\n   sometimes be the case.\n   Applications\
    \ should always treat language tags as a single token; the\n   division into main\
    \ tag and subtags is an administrative mechanism,\n   not a navigation aid.\n\
    \   The relationship between the tag and the information it relates to is\n  \
    \ defined by the standard describing the context in which it appears.\n   So,\
    \ this section can only give possible examples of its usage.\n    -    For a single\
    \ information object, it should be taken as the\n         set of languages that\
    \ is required for a complete\n         comprehension of the complete object. Example:\
    \ Simple text.\n    -    For an aggregation of information objects, it should\
    \ be taken\n         as the set of languages used inside components of that\n\
    \         aggregation.  Examples: Document stores and libraries.\n    -    For\
    \ information objects whose purpose in life is providing\n         alternatives,\
    \ it should be regarded as a hint that the\n         material inside is provided\
    \ in several languages, and that\n         one has to inspect each of the alternatives\
    \ in order to find\n         its language or languages.  In this case, multiple\
    \ languages\n         need not mean that one needs to be multilingual to get\n\
    \         complete understanding of the document. Example: MIME\n         multipart/alternative.\n\
    \    -    It would be possible to define (for instance) an SGML DTD\n        \
    \ that defines a <LANG xx> tag for indicating that following or\n         contained\
    \ text is written in this language, such that one\n         could write \"<LANG\
    \ FR>C'est la vie</LANG>\"; the Norwegian-\n         speaking user could then\
    \ access a French-Norwegian dictionary\n         to find out what the quote meant.\n"
- title: 3.  The Content-language header
  contents:
  - "3.  The Content-language header\n   The Language header is intended for use in\
    \ the case where one desires\n   to indicate the language(s) of something that\
    \ has RFC-822-like\n   headers, like MIME body parts or Web documents.\n   The\
    \ RFC-822 EBNF of the Language header is:\n    Language-Header = \"Content-Language\"\
    \ \":\" 1#Language-tag\n   Note that the Language-Header is allowed to list several\
    \ languages in\n   a comma-separated list.\n   Whitespace is allowed, which means\
    \ also that one can place\n   parenthesized comments anywhere in the language\
    \ sequence.\n"

  - "3.1.  Examples of Content-language values\n   NOTE: NONE of the subtags shown\

- title: 4.  Use of Content-Language with Multipart/Alternative
  contents:
  - "4.  Use of Content-Language with Multipart/Alternative\n   When using the Multipart/Alternative\
    \ body part of MIME, it is\n   possible to have the body parts giving the same\
    \ information content\n   in different languages. In this case, one should put\
    \ a Content-\n   Language header on each of the body parts, and a summary Content-\n\
    \   Language header onto the Multipart/Alternative itself.\n"
- title: 4.1.  The differences parameter to multipart/alternative
  contents:
  - "4.1.  The differences parameter to multipart/alternative\n   As defined in RFC\
    \ 1541, Multipart/Alternative only has one parameter:\n   boundary.\n   The common\
    \ usage of Multipart/Alternative is to have more than one\n   format of the same\
    \ message (f.ex. PostScript and ASCII).\n   The use of language tags to differentiate\
    \ between different\n   alternatives will certainly not lead all MIME UAs to present\
    \ the most\n   sensible body part as default.\n   Therefore, a new parameter is\
    \ defined, to allow the configuration of\n   MIME readers to handle language differences\
    \ in a sensible manner.\n    Name: Differences\n    Value: One or more of\n  \
    \       Content-Type\n         Content-Language\n   Further values can be registered\
    \ with IANA; it must be the name of a\n   header for which a definition exists\
    \ in a published RFC.  If not\n   present, Differences=Content-Type is assumed.\n\
    \   The intent is that the MIME reader can look at these headers of the\n   message\
    \ component to do an intelligent choice of what to present to\n   the user, based\
    \ on knowledge about the user preferences and\n   capabilities.\n   (The intent\
    \ of having registration with IANA of the fields used in\n   this context is to\
    \ maintain a list of usages that a mail UA may\n   expect to see, not to reject\
    \ usages.)\n   (NOTE: The MIME specification [RFC 1521], section 7.2, states that\n\
    \   headers not beginning with \"Content-\" are generally to be ignored in\n \
    \  body parts. People defining a header for use with \"differences=\"\n   should\
    \ take note of this.)\n   The mechanism for deciding which body part to present\
    \ is outside the\n   scope of this document.\n    MIME EXAMPLE:\n    Content-Type:\
    \ multipart/alternative; differences=Content-Language;\n              boundary=\"\
    limit\"\n    Content-Language: en, fr, de\n    --limit\n    Content-Language:\
    \ fr\n    Le renard brun et agile saute par dessus le chien paresseux\n    --limit\n\
    \    Content-Language: de\n    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1\n\
    \    Content-Transfer-encoding: quoted-printable\n    Der schnelle braune Fuchs\
    \ h=FCpft =FCber den faulen Hund\n    --limit\n    Content-Language: en\n    The\
    \ quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n    --limit--\n   When composing a\
    \ message, the choice of sequence may be somewhat\n   arbitrary. However, non-MIME\
    \ mail readers will show the first body\n   part first, meaning that this should\
    \ most likely be the language\n   understood by most of the recipients.\n"
