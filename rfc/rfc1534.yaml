- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a\
    \ mechanism\n   for transmitting configuration parameters to hosts using the TCP/IP\n\
    \   protocol suite.  The format of DHCP messages is based on the format\n   of\
    \ BOOTP messages, so that, in certain circumstances, DHCP and BOOTP\n   participants\
    \ may exchange messages.  This document specifies the ways\n   in which DHCP and\
    \ BOOTP participants may interoperate.\n   DHCP introduces a small change in terminology\
    \ intended to clarify the\n   meaning of one of the fields.  What was the \"vendor\
    \ extensions\" field\n   in BOOTP has been re-named the \"options\" field in DHCP.\
    \  Similarly,\n   the tagged data items that were used inside the BOOTP \"vendor\n\
    \   extensions\" field, which were formerly referred to as \"vendor\n   extensions\"\
    , are now termed simply \"options\".  This document will\n   refer to BOOTP vendor\
    \ extensions and DHCP options uniformly as\n   \"options\".\n   Throughout this\
    \ document, DHCP messages that include a 'DHCP message\n   type' option will be\
    \ referred to by the type of the message; e.g., a\n   DHCP message with 'DHCP\
    \ message type' option type 1 will be referred\n   to as a \"DHCPDISCOVER\" message.\n"
- title: 2. BOOTP clients and DHCP servers
  contents:
  - "2. BOOTP clients and DHCP servers\n   The format of DHCP messages is defined\
    \ to be compatible with the\n   format of BOOTP messages, so that existing BOOTP\
    \ clients can\n   interoperate with DHCP servers.  Any message received by a DHCP\n\
    \   server that includes a 'DHCP message type' (51) option is assumed to\n   have\
    \ been sent by a DHCP client.  Messages without the DHCP Message\n   Type option\
    \ are assumed to have been sent by a BOOTP client.  Support\n   of BOOTP clients\
    \ by a DHCP server is optional at the discretion of\n   the local system administrator.\
    \  If a DHCP server that is not\n   configured to support BOOTP clients receives\
    \ a BOOTREQUEST message\n   from a BOOTP client, that server silently discards\
    \ the BOOTREQUEST\n   message.\n   If a DHCP server is configured to support BOOTP\
    \ clients, it may be\n   configured to supply static addresses, automatic addresses\
    \ or both.\n   Static addresses are those that have been previously assigned by\
    \ a\n   system administrator and are stored in a database available to the\n \
    \  DHCP server.  Automatic addresses are those selected by the DHCP\n   server\
    \ from its pool of unassigned addresses.\n   Since BOOTP clients may not be prepared\
    \ to receive automatic\n   addresses, the decision to allow a DHCP server to return\
    \ automatic\n   addresses must be under the control of the system administrator.\
    \  If\n   a DHCP server supports supplying automatic addresses to BOOTP\n   clients,\
    \ this feature must be configurable, and the feature must\n   default off.  Enabling\
    \ of the feature must be the result of an active\n   decision by the system administrator.\n\
    \   If a DHCP server returns a automatic address, the BOOTP client will\n   not\
    \ be aware of the DHCP lease mechanism for network address\n   assignment.  Thus\
    \ the DHCP server must assign an infinite lease\n   duration to for automatic\
    \ addresses assigned to BOOTP clients.  Such\n   network addresses cannot be automatically\
    \ reassigned by the server.\n   The local system administrator may choose to manually\
    \ release network\n   addresses assigned to BOOTP clients.\n   A DHCP server that\
    \ supports BOOTP clients MUST interact with BOOTP\n   clients according to the\
    \ BOOTP protocol.  The server MUST formulate a\n   BOOTP BOOTREPLY message rather\
    \ than a DHCP DHCPOFFER message (i.e.,\n   the server MUST NOT include the 'DHCP\
    \ message type' option and MUST\n   NOT exceed the size limit for BOOTREPLY messages).\
    \  The server marks\n   a binding for a BOOTP client as BOUND after sending the\
    \ BOOTP\n   BOOTREPLY, as a non-DHCP client will not send a DHCPREQUEST message\n\
    \   nor will that client expect a DHCPACK message.\n   DHCP servers MAY send any\
    \ DHCP Options to a BOOTP client as allowed\n   by the \"DHCP Options and BOOTP\
    \ Vendor Extensions\" RFC [2].\n   In summary, a DHCP server:\n      o MAY support\
    \ BOOTP clients,\n      o May return automatic addresses to BOOTP clients,\n \
    \     o MUST provide a configuration switch if returning automatic\n        addresses\
    \ to BOOTP clients,\n      o MUST default this optional configuration to OFF,\n\
    \      o MUST abide by the BOOTP specification when interacting with\n       \
    \ BOOTP clients, and\n      o MAY send DHCP options (those options defined in\
    \ the DHCP options\n        document but not in the BOOTP vendor extensions documents)\
    \ to\n        a BOOTP client.\n"

  contents:
  - "3. DHCP clients and BOOTP servers\n   A DHCP client MAY use a reply from a BOOTP\
    \ server if the\n   configuration returned from the BOOTP server is acceptable\
    \ to the\n   DHCP client.  A DHCP client MUST assume that an IP address returned\n\
    \   in a message from a BOOTP server has an infinite lease.  A DHCP\n   client\
    \ SHOULD choose to use a reply from a DHCP server in preference\n   to a reply\
    \ from a BOOTP server.\n"
