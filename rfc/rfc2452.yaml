  - "Abstract\n   This document is one in the series of documents that define various\n\
    \   MIB objects for IPv6.  Specifically, this document is the MIB module\n   which\
    \ defines managed objects for implementations of the Transmission\n   Control\
    \ Protocol (TCP) over IP Version 6 (IPv6).\n   This document also recommends a\
    \ specific policy with respect to the\n   applicability of RFC 2012 for implementations\
    \ of IPv6.  Namely, that\n   most of managed objects defined in RFC 2012 are independent\
    \ of which\n   IP versions underlie TCP, and only the TCP connection information\
    \ is\n   IP version-specific.\n   This memo defines an experimental portion of\
    \ the Management\n   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols\
    \ in\n   IPv6-based internets.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   A management system contains: several (potentially many)\
    \ nodes, each\n   with a processing entity, termed an agent, which has access\
    \ to\n   management instrumentation; at least one management station; and, a\n\
    \   management protocol, used to convey management information between\n   the\
    \ agents and management stations.  Operations of the protocol are\n   carried\
    \ out under an administrative framework which defines\n   authentication, authorization,\
    \ access control, and privacy policies.\n   Management stations execute management\
    \ applications which monitor and\n   control managed elements.  Managed elements\
    \ are devices such as\n   hosts, routers, terminal servers, etc., which are monitored\
    \ and\n   controlled via access to their management information.\n   Management\
    \ information is viewed as a collection of managed objects,\n   residing in a\
    \ virtual information store, termed the Management\n   Information Base (MIB).\
    \  Collections of related objects are defined\n   in MIB modules.  These modules\
    \ are written using a subset of OSI's\n   Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)\
    \ [1], termed the Structure of\n   Management Information (SMI) [2].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Overview\n   This document is one in the series of documents that define\
    \ various\n   MIB objects, and statements of conformance, for IPv6.  This document\n\
    \   defines the required instrumentation for implementations of TCP over\n   IPv6.\n"
- title: 3.  Transparency of IP versions to TCP
  contents:
  - "3.  Transparency of IP versions to TCP\n   The fact that a particular TCP connection\
    \ uses IPv6 as opposed to\n   IPv4, is largely invisible to a TCP implementation.\
    \  A \"TCPng\" did\n   not need to be defined, implementations simply need to\
    \ support IPv6\n   addresses.\n   As such, the managed objects already defined\
    \ in [TCP MIB] are\n   sufficient for managing TCP in the presence of IPv6.  These\
    \ objects\n   are equally applicable whether the managed node supports IPv4 only,\n\
    \   IPv6 only, or both IPv4 and IPv6.\n   For example, tcpActiveOpens counts \"\
    The number of times TCP\n   connections have made a direct transition to the SYN-SENT\
    \ state from\n   the CLOSED state\", regardless of which version of IP is used\
    \ between\n   the connection endpoints.\n   Stated differently, TCP implementations\
    \ don't need separate counters\n   for IPv4 and for IPv6.\n"
- title: 4.  Representing TCP Connections
  contents:
  - "4.  Representing TCP Connections\n   The exception to the statements in section\
    \ 3 is the tcpConnTable.\n   Since IPv6 addresses cannot be represented with the\
    \ IpAddress syntax,\n   not all TCP connections can be represented in the tcpConnTable\n\
    \   defined in [TCP MIB].\n   This memo defines a new, separate table to represent\
    \ only those TCP\n   connections between IPv6 endpoints.  TCP connections between\
    \ IPv4\n   endpoints continue to be represented in tcpConnTable [TCP MIB].  (It\n\
    \   is not possible to establish a TCP connection between an IPv4\n    endpoint\
    \ and an IPv6 endpoint.)\n   A different approach would have been to define a\
    \ new table to\n   represent all TCP connections regardless of IP version.  This\
    \ would\n   require changes to [TCP MIB] and hence to existing (IPv4-only) TCP\n\
    \   implementations.  The approach suggested in this memo has the\n   advantage\
    \ of leaving IPv4-only implementations intact.\n   It is assumed that the objects\
    \ defined in this memo will eventually\n   be defined in an update to [TCP MIB].\
    \  For this reason, the module\n   identity is assigned under the experimental\
    \ portion of the MIB.\n"

- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   This MIB contains a management object that has\
    \ a MAX-ACCESS clause of\n   read-write and/or read-create.  In particular, it\
    \ is possible to\n   delete individual TCP control blocks (i.e., connections).\n\
    \   Consequently, anyone having the ability to issue a SET on this object\n  \
    \ can impact the operation of the node.\n   There are a number of managed objects\
    \ in this MIB that may be\n   considered to contain sensitive information in some\
    \ environments.\n   For example, the MIB identifies the active TCP connections\
    \ on the\n   node.  Although this information might be considered sensitive in\n\
    \   some environments (i.e., to identify ports on which to launch\n   denial-of-service\
    \ or other attacks), there are already other ways of\n   obtaining similar information.\
    \  For example, sending a random TCP\n   packet to an unused port prompts the\
    \ generation of a TCP reset\n   message.\n   Therefore, it may be important in\
    \ some environments to control read\n   and/or write access to these objects and\
    \ possibly to even encrypt the\n   values of these object when sending them over\
    \ the network via SNMP.\n   Not all versions of SNMP provide features for such\
    \ a secure\n   environment.  SNMPv1 by itself does not provide encryption or strong\n\
    \   authentication.\n   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security\n\
    \   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use\n   of\
    \ the User-based Security Model [RFC2274] and the View-based Access\n   Control\
    \ Model [RFC2275] is recommended.\n   It is then a customer/user responsibility\
    \ to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB,\
    \ is properly\n   configured to give access to those objects only to those principals\n\
    \   (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.\n"
