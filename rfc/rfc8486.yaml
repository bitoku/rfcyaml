  - "1.  Introduction\n   Ambisonics is a representation format for three-dimensional
    sound\n   fields that can be used for surround sound and immersive virtual-\n
    \  reality playback.  See [fellgett75] and [daniel04] for technical\n   details
    on the Ambisonics format.  For the purposes of the this\n   document, Ambisonics
    can be considered a multichannel audio stream.\n   A separate stereo stream can
    be used alongside the Ambisonics in a\n   head-tracked virtual reality experience
    to provide so-called non-\n   diegetic audio -- that is, audio that should remain
    unchanged by\n   rotation of the listener's head, such as narration or stereo
    music.\n   Ogg is a general-purpose container, supporting audio, video, and\n
    \  other media.  It can be used to encapsulate audio streams coded using\n   the
    Opus codec.  See [RFC6716] and [RFC7845] for technical details on\n   the Opus
    codec and its encapsulation in the Ogg container,\n   respectively.\n   This document
    extends the Ogg Opus format by defining two new channel\n   mapping families for
    encoding Ambisonics.  The Ogg Opus format is\n   extended indirectly by adding
    items with values 2 and 3 to the \"Opus\n   Channel Mapping Families\" IANA registry.
    \ When 2 or 3 are used as the\n   Channel Mapping Family Number in an Ogg stream,
    the semantic meaning\n   of the channels in the multichannel Opus stream is one
    of the\n   Ambisonics layouts defined in this document.  This mapping can also\n
    \  be used in other contexts that make use of the channel mappings\n   defined
    by the \"Opus Channel Mapping Families\" registry.\n   Furthermore, mapping families
    240 through 254 (inclusively) are\n   reserved for experimental use.\n"

    by encoding with the\n   Opus codec and setting the channel mapping family value
    to 2 or 3 in\n   the Ogg identification (ID) header.  A demuxer implementation\n
    \  encountering channel mapping family 2 or 3 MUST interpret the Opus\n   stream

    - "3.1.  Channel Mapping Family 2\n   This channel mapping uses the same channel
      mapping table format used\n   by channel mapping family 1.  The output channels
      are Ambisonic\n   components ordered in Ambisonic Channel Number (ACN) order
      (which is\n   defined in Figure 1) followed by two optional channels of non-\n
      \  diegetic stereo indexed (left, right).  The terms \"order\" and\n   \"degree\"
      are defined according to [ambix].\n                         ACN = n * (n + 1)
      + m,\n                         for order n and degree m.\n                 Figure
      1: Ambisonic Channel Number (ACN)\n   For the Ambisonic channels, the ACN component
      corresponds to channel\n   index as k = ACN.  The reverse correspondence can
      also be computed\n   for an Ambisonic channel with index k.\n                       order
      \  n = floor(sqrt(k)),\n                       degree  m = k - n * (n + 1).\n
      \              Figure 2: Ambisonic Degree and Order from ACN\n   Note that channel
      mapping family 2 allows for so-called mixed-order\n   Ambisonic representation,
      in which only a subset of the full\n   Ambisonic order number of channels is
      encoded.  By specifying the\n   full number in the channel count field, the
      inactive ACNs can then be\n   indicated in the channel mapping field using the
      index 255.\n   Ambisonic channels are normalized with Schmidt Semi-Normalization\n
      \  (SN3D).  The interpretation of the Ambisonics signal as well as\n   detailed
      definitions of ACN channel ordering and SN3D normalization\n   are described
      in [ambix], Section 2.1.\n"

    - "3.2.  Channel Mapping Family 3\n   In this mapping, C output channels (the
      channel count) are generated\n   at the decoder by multiplying K = N + M decoded
      channels with a\n   designated demixing matrix, D, having C rows and K columns
      (C and K\n   do not have to be equal).  Here, N denotes the number of streams\n
      \  encoded, and M is the number of these encoded streams that are\n   coupled
      to produce two channels.  As for channel mapping family 2,\n   this mapping
      family also allows for the encoding and decoding of\n   full-order Ambisonics
      and mixed-order Ambisonics, as well as non-\n   diegetic stereo channels.  Furthermore,
      it has the added flexibility\n   of mixing channels.  Let X denote a column
      vector containing K\n   decoded channels X1, X2, ..., XK (from N streams), and

      \      Figure 4: Channel Mapping Table for Channel Mapping Family 3\n   The

      Count \"N\" (8 bits, unsigned):\n       This is the total number of streams
      encoded in each Ogg packet.\n   2.  Coupled Stream Count \"M\" (8 bits, unsigned):\n
      \      This is the number of the N streams whose decoders are to be\n       configured
      to produce two channels (stereo).\n   3.  Demixing Matrix (16*K*C bits, signed):\n
      \      The coefficients of the demixing matrix stored in column-major\n       order
      as 16-bit, signed, two's complement fixed-point values with\n       15 fractional
      bits (Q15), little endian.  If needed, the output\n       gain field can be
      used for a normalization scale.  For mixed-\n       order Ambisonic representations,
      the silent ACN channels are\n       indicated by all zeros in the corresponding
      rows of the mixing\n       matrix.  This also allows for mixed order with non-diegetic\n
      \      stereo as the number of columns implies the presence of non-\n       diegetic
      channels.\n   Note that [RFC7845] specifies that the identification header cannot\n
      \  exceed one \"page\", which is 65,025 octets.  This limits the Ambisonic\n
      \  order, which then MUST be lower than 12, if full order is utilized\n   and
      the number of coded streams is the same as the Ambisonic order\n   plus the
      two non-diegetic channels.  The total output channel number,\n   C, MUST be

      whether\n   or not there is a separate non-diegetic stereo stream.  This\n   corresponds
      to periphonic Ambisonics from zeroth to fourteenth order\n   plus potentially
      two channels of non-diegetic stereo.  Explicitly,\n   the allowed number of

      streams is the same as the Ambisonic\n   order plus the two non-diegetic channels,
