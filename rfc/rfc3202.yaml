- title: 1.  The SNMP Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The SNMP Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently\
    \ consists of five major\n   components:\n   o  An overall architecture, described\
    \ in RFC 2571 [1].\n   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events\
    \ for the\n      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of\n\
    \      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD\n   \
    \   16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].  The\n      second\
    \ version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578\n      [5], RFC 2579\
    \ [6] and RFC 2580 [7].\n   o  Message protocols for transferring management information.\
    \  The\n      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and\n\
    \      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second version of the SNMP\n    \
    \  message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track\n      protocol,\
    \ is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC\n      1906 [10].  The\
    \ third version of the message protocol is called\n      SNMPv3 and described\
    \ in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574\n      [12].\n   o  Protocol operations\
    \ for accessing management information.  The\n      first set of protocol operations\
    \ and associated PDU formats is\n      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second\
    \ set of protocol\n      operations and associated PDU formats is described in\
    \ RFC 1905\n      [13].\n   o  A set of fundamental applications described in\
    \ RFC 2573 [14] and\n      the view-based access control mechanism described in\
    \ RFC 2575\n      [15].\n   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management\
    \ Framework\n   can be found in RFC 2570 [16].\n   Managed objects are accessed\
    \ via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base\
    \ or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n   defined using the mechanisms defined in\
    \ the SMI.\n   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.\
    \  A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate\n\
    \   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically\n   equivalent,\
    \ except where objects or events are omitted because no\n   translation is possible\
    \ (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable\n   information in SMIv2 will be\
    \ converted into textual descriptions in\n   SMIv1 during the translation process.\
    \  However, this loss of machine\n   readable information is not considered to\
    \ change the semantics of the\n   MIB.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Frame Relay Service Level Definitions
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Frame Relay Service Level Definitions\n   The frame relay service level\
    \ definitions address specific\n   characteristics of a frame relay service that\
    \ can be used to\n   facilitate the following tasks:\n   o  Evaluation of frame\
    \ relay service providers, offerings or\n      products.\n   o  Measurement of\
    \ Quality of Service.\n   o  Enforcement of Service Level Agreements.\n   o  Planning\
    \ or describing a frame relay network.\n   The following parameters are defined\
    \ in FRF.13 [17] as a sufficient\n   set of values to accomplish the tasks previously\
    \ stated.\n   o  Delay - The amount of time elapsed, in microseconds, from the\
    \ time\n      a frame exits the source to the time it reaches the destination.\n\
    \      NOTE: FRF.13 [17] defines this value in terms of milliseconds.\n   o  Frame\
    \ Delivery Ratio - The ratio of the number of frames delivered\n      to the destination\
    \ versus the number of frames sent by the source.\n      This ratio can be further\
    \ divided by inspecting either only the\n      frames within the CIR or only the\
    \ frames in excess of the CIR.\n   o  Data Delivery Ratio - The ratio of the amount\
    \ of data delivered to\n      the destination versus the amount of data sent by\
    \ the source.\n      This ratio can be further divided by inspecting either only\
    \ the\n      data within the CIR or only the data in excess of the CIR.\n   o\
    \  Service Availability - The amount of time the frame relay service\n      was\
    \ not available.  There are three types of availability\n      statistics defined\
    \ in FRF.13 [17]: Mean Time to Repair, Virtual\n      Connection Availability,\
    \ and Mean Time Between Service Outages.\n      The later two require information\
    \ about the scheduled outage time.\n      It is assumed that scheduled outage\
    \ time information will be\n      maintained by the network management software,\
    \ so it is not\n      included in the MIB module.\n   Consult FRF.13 [17] for\
    \ more details.\n"

    \ that has\n      its end-points and bearer capabilities defined at subscription\n\
    \      time [18].\n   o  Reference Point (RP) - The point of reference within\

    \ (FRF.13 [17])\n   The MIB variables frsldPvcCtrlTransmitRP and frsldPvcCtrlReceiveRP\n\
    \   allow the user to view and configure the reference points at which\n   the\
    \ calculations occur.  These variables are specific to the device\n   on which\
    \ they are located.  Frame relay devices act as both frame\n   sources and frame\
    \ destinations.  The definitions in this MIB module\n   apply to the interaction\
    \ of a pair of devices on the network path.\n   The same device can potentially\
    \ use different reference points for\n   calculation and collection of the statistics\
    \ based on whether the\n   referenced frame is sent or received by the device.\
    \  When the device\n   is acting as a frame source, the value of frsldPvcCtrlTransmitRP\n\
    \   reflects the reference point used for all source calculations\n   pertaining\
    \ to the specified PVC.  When the device is acting as a\n   frame destination,\
    \ the value of frsldPvcCtrlReceiveRP reflects the\n   reference point used for\
    \ all destination calculations pertaining to\n   the specified PVC.\n   For example,\
    \ FRF.13 [17] defines an Edge-to-Edge Egress Queue\n   measurement domain as a\
    \ domain in which measurement is performed\n   between an Ingress Reference Point\
    \ and an Egress Queue Input\n   Reference Point.  For this domain between a source\
    \ device and a\n   destination device, the value of frsldPvcCtrlTransmitRP for\
    \ the\n   source device would be set to ingTxLocalRP(2) and the value of\n   frsldPvcCtrlReceiveRP\
    \ for the destination device would be set to\n   eqiRxLocalRP(4).  While it is\
    \ usually the case that the reference\n   points would be equivalent on the remote\
    \ device when monitoring\n   frames going in the opposite direction, there is\
    \ no requirement for\n   them to be so.\n   It can be seen from the above example\
    \ that a total of four reference\n   points are required in order to collect information\
    \ for both\n   directions of traffic flow.  The reference points represent the\n\
    \   transmit and receive directions at both ends of a PVC.  If a device\n   has\
    \ knowledge of the information from the remote device, it is\n   possible to collect\
    \ the statistics from a single device.  This is not\n   always the case.  In most\
    \ instances, two devices will need to be\n   monitored to capture a complete description\
    \ of the service level on a\n   PVC.  The reference points a single device is\
    \ capable of monitoring\n   are contained in the frsldRPCaps object.\n"

  - "3.6.2.  Determining Reference Points for Row Creation\n   The performance of\
    \ a PVC is monitored by evaluating the uni-\n   directional flow of frames from\
    \ an ingress point to an egress point.\n   Reference points describe where each\
    \ of the two measurements are\n   made.  Monitoring both of the uni-directional\
    \ flows that make-up the\n   PVC frame traffic requires a total of four reference\
    \ points as shown\n   in Figures 3 through 5.  A monitoring point that evaluates\
    \ traffic is\n   restricted to counting frames that pass the reference points\
    \ hosted\n   locally on the monitoring point.  Thus, if the monitoring point is\n\
    \   near the ingress point of the flow, it will count the frames entering\n  \
    \ into the frame relay network.  The complete picture of frame loss for\n   the\
    \ uni-directional flow requires information from the downstream\n   reference\
    \ point located at another (remote) monitoring point.\n   The local monitoring\
    \ point MAY be implemented in such way that the\n   information from the downstream\
    \ monitoring point is moved to the\n   local monitoring point using implementation-specific\
    \ mechanisms.  In\n   this case all information required to calculate frame loss\
    \ becomes\n   available from the local measurement point.  The local measurement\n\
    \   point agent is capable of reporting all the objects in the\n   FrsldPvcDataEntry\
    \ row - the counts for offered frames entering the\n   network and delivered frames\
    \ exiting the network.\n   Alternatively, the local monitoring point MAY be restricted\
    \ to counts\n   of frames observed on the local device only.  In this case, the\n\
    \   objects of the FrsldPvcDataEntry row reporting what happened on the\n   remote\
    \ device are not available.\n   The following list shows the possible valid reference\
    \ points for an\n   FRF.13 SLA from the source reference point to the destination\n\
    \   reference point in both directions.\n   o  Local Information Only\n      \
    \   Local Device:  srcLocalRP, desLocalRP\n         Remote Device: srcLocalRP,\

    \   The following steps are recommended to find which reference points\n   need\
    \ to be configured:\n   1) Locate both of the devices at either end of the PVC\
    \ to be\n      monitored.\n   2) Determine the capabilities by referencing the\
    \ frsldRPCaps object\n      of each device.\n   3) Locate the best combination\
    \ of the two devices such that the\n      necessary reference points are all represented.\n\
    \   4) If any one of the necessary reference points does not exist in the\n  \
    \    combination of the two devices, it is not possible to monitor the\n     \

    \ that will least affect the active network traffic.\n   The sample data can be\
    \ collected using a series of SNMP getNext or\n   getBulk operations.  The value\
    \ of frsldPvcSmplIdx increments with\n   each new collection bucket.  This allows\
    \ the managers to skip\n   information that has already been collected.  However,\
    \ care should be\n   taken in that the value can roll over after a long period\
    \ of time.\n   The start and end times of a collection period allow the manager\
    \ to\n   know what the actual period of collection was.  It is possible for\n\
    \   there to be discontinuities in the sample table, so both start and\n   end\
    \ should be referenced.\n"

  - "3.6.6.3.  User History\n   User history, as defined in RFC 2021 [19], is an alternative\n\
    \   mechanism that can be used to get the same benefits as the sample\n   table\
    \ by using the objects provided for real-time polling.  Some\n   devices MAY have\
    \ the ability to use user history and opt not to\n   support the sample tables.\
    \  If this is the case, the information from\n   the data table can be used to\
    \ define a group of user history objects.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.6.7.  Use of MIB Module in Calculation of Service Level Definitions\n   The\
    \ objects in this MIB module can be used to calculate the\n   statistics defined\
    \ in FRF.13 [17].  The description below describes\n   the calculations for one\
    \ direction of the data flow, i.e., data sent\n   from local transmitter to a\
    \ remote receiver.  A complete set of\n   bidirectional information would require\
    \ calculations based on both\n   directions.  For the purposes of this description,\
    \ the reference\n   points used SHOULD consistently represent data that is sent\
    \ by one\n   device and received by the other.\n   A complete evaluation requires\
    \ the combination of two uni-directional\n   flows.  It is possible for a management\
    \ station to combine all of the\n   calculated information into one conceptual\
    \ row.  Doing this requires\n   that each of the metrics are collected for both\
    \ flow directions and\n   grouped by direction  If the information is split between\
    \ two\n   devices, the management station must know which two devices to\n   communicate\
    \ with for the collection of all information.  The grouping\n   of information\
    \ SHOULD be from ingress to egress in each flow\n   direction.\n   The calculations\
    \ below use the following terminology:\n   o  DelayAvg\n         The average delay\

    \ variable described in DelayAvg above.  The delay may be\n   calculated as either\
    \ round trip or one way, and this information is\n   held in the frsldPvcCtrlDelayType\
    \ MIB variable.  If the delay be\n   calculated as round trip, the value of DelayAvg\

- title: 4.  Relation to Other MIB Modules
  contents:
  - "4.  Relation to Other MIB Modules\n   There is no explicit relation to any other\
    \ frame relay MIB module nor\n   are any required to implement this MIB module.\
    \  However, there is a\n   need for knowledge of ifIndexes and some understanding\
    \ of DLCIs.  The\n   ifIndex information can be found in the IF-MIB [21] which\
    \ is\n   required.  The DLCI information can be found in either the Frame\n  \
    \ Relay DTE MIB (RFC 2115) [20] or the Frame Relay Network Services MIB\n   (RFC\
    \ 2954) [18]; however, neither is required.\n   Upon setting of frsldPvcCtrlStatus\
    \ in the frsldPvcCtrlTable to\n   active(1) the system can be in one of the following\
    \ three states:\n   (1) The respective DLCI is known and is active.  This corresponds\
    \ to\n       a state in which frPVCEndptRowStatus is active(1) and\n       frPVCEndptRcvdSigStatus\
    \ is either active(2) or none(4) for the\n       Frame Relay Network Services\
    \ MIB (RFC 2954) [18].  For the Frame\n       Relay DTE MIB, the same state is\
    \ shown by frCircuitRowStatus of\n       active(1) and  frCircuitState of active(2).\n\
    \   (2) The respective DLCI has not been created.  This corresponds to a\n   \
    \    state in which the row with either frPVCEndptDLCIIndex or\n       frCircuitDlci\
    \ equal to the respective DLCI does not exist in\n       either the frPVCEndptTable\
    \ or the frCircuitTable respectively.\n   (3) The respective DLCI has just been\
    \ removed.  This corresponds to a\n       state in which either frPVCEndptRowStatus\
    \ is no longer active(1)\n       or frPVCEndptRcvdSigStatus is no longer active(2)\
    \ or none(4) for\n       the Frame Relay Network Services MIB (RFC 2954) [18].\
    \  For the\n       Frame Relay DTE MIB, the same state is shown when either\n\
    \       frCircuitRowStatus is no longer active(1) or frCircuitState is no\n  \
    \     longer active(2).\n   For the first case, the row in the frsldPvcDataTable\
    \ will be filled.\n   If frsldSmplCtrlStatus in the frsldSmplCtrlTable for the\
    \ respective\n   DLCI is also `active' the frsldPvcSampleTable will be filled\
    \ as well.\n   For the second case, the respective rows will not be added to any\
    \ of\n   the data or sample tables and frsldPvcCtrlStatus SHOULD report\n   notReady(3).\n\
    \   For the third case, frsldPvcCtrlDeleteOnPurge should direct the\n   behavior\
    \ of the system.  If all tables are purged, this case will be\n   equivalent to\
    \ the second case above.  Otherwise, frsldPvcCtrlStatus\n   SHOULD remain active(1).\n"

- title: 10.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB that\n   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.\
    \  Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n\
    \   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment\
    \ without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.\n\
    \   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network\n   itself\
    \ is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no\n   control as\
    \ to who on the secure network is allowed to access and\n   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects in this MIB.\n   It is recommended that the implementers consider\
    \ the security\n   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically,\
    \ the use\n   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based\n\
    \   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.\n   It is then a customer/user\
    \ responsibility to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity giving access to an instance\
    \ of this MIB, is properly\n   configured to give access to the objects only to\
    \ those principals\n   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET\n\
    \   (change/create/delete) them.\n"
