  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops\n\
    \   designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the\n   Internet,\
    \ and to suggest future directions for the Internet\n   architecture.  This long-term\
    \ planning function of the IAB is\n   complementary to the ongoing engineering\
    \ efforts performed by working\n   groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force\
    \ (IETF), under the\n   leadership of the Internet Engineering Steering Group\
    \ (IESG) and area\n   directorates.\n   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB)\
    \ and the Internet Society (ISOC)\n   hosted a day-long Coordinating Attack Response\
    \ at Internet Scale\n   (CARIS) workshop on 18 June 2015 in coordination with\
    \ the Forum for\n   Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) Conference in\
    \ Berlin.\n   The workshop included members of the FIRST community, attack response\n\
    \   working group representatives, network and security operators,\n   Regional\
    \ Internet Registry (RIR) representatives, researchers,\n   vendors, and representatives\
    \ from standardization communities.  The\n   key goals of the workshop were to\
    \ improve mutual awareness,\n   understanding, and coordination among the diverse\
    \ participating\n   organizations.  The workshop also aimed to provide the attendees\
    \ with\n   greater awareness of existing efforts to mitigate specific types of\n\
    \   attacks, and greater understanding of the options available to\n   collaborate\
    \ and engage with these efforts.\n   The day-long workshop included a mix of invited\
    \ talks and panel\n   discussion sessions with opportunities to collaborate throughout,\n\
    \   taking full advantage of the tremendous value of having these diverse\n  \
    \ communities with common goals in one room.  There were approximately\n   50\
    \ participants engaged in the CARIS workshop.\n   Attendance at the workshop was\
    \ by invitation only.  Prior to the\n   workshop, existing attack-mitigation working\
    \ groups were asked to\n   complete a survey.  The data gathered through this\
    \ questionnaire,\n   including how third parties can participate in or contribute\
    \ to the\n   attack-mitigation working group, was shared with all of the\n   participants\
    \ at the workshop to better enable collaboration [ISOC].\n   Attendees were also\
    \ selected from submissions of two-page position\n   papers that included some\
    \ key insight or challenge relevant to the\n   broader group.  Paper topics included\
    \ research topics related to\n   attack mitigation or information sharing/exchange,\
    \ success stories,\n   lessons learned, and more in-depth studies on specific\
    \ topics such as\n   privacy or trust.\n   The program committee received 25 papers\
    \ and 19 template submissions.\n   The template submissions will be maintained\
    \ by the Internet Society,\n   and as a result of the workshop, they will be amended\
    \ to provide\n   additional value to the Computer Security Incident Response Teams\n\
    \   (CSIRTs) and attack response communities/operators on their\n   information\
    \ exchange capabilities.  The CARIS participants found the\n   template submissions\
    \ to be very useful in coordinating their future\n   attack mitigation efforts.\
    \  This initiative is a new, open for the\n   global community, and hosted in\
    \ a neutral location.  All submissions\n   are available online and are linked\
    \ from the agenda [AGENDA].\n   The workshop talks and panels involved full participation\
    \ from\n   attendees who were required to read all the submitted materials.  The\n\
    \   panels were organized to spur conversation between specific groups to\n  \
    \ see if progress could be made towards more efficient and effective\n   attack\
    \ mitigation efforts.  See [KME] for additional information on\n   possible approaches\
    \ to accomplish more effective attack response and\n   information exchanges with\
    \ methods that require fewer analysts.\n   The workshop was run under the Chatham\
    \ House Rule to facilitate the\n   exchange of sensitive information involved\
    \ with incident response.\n   As such, there was no recording, but minutes were\
    \ taken and used to\n   aid in the generation of this report.  Comments will not\
    \ be\n   attributed to any particular attendee, nor will organizations be\n  \
    \ named in association with any discussion topics that were not made\n   public\
    \ through submission templates or papers by the submitter and\n   organization.\n"
- title: 2.  Sessions and Panel Groups
  contents:
  - "2.  Sessions and Panel Groups\n   After an initial presentation to set the stage\
    \ and elaborate the\n   goals of the workshop, the day was divided into five sessions\
    \ as\n   follows:\n   1.  Coordination between CSIRTs and attack-response mitigation\n\
    \       efforts\n   2.  Scaling response to Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)\
    \ and\n       botnets effectively and safely\n   3.  Infrastructure: DNS and RIR\
    \ providers and researchers\n   4.  Trust and Privacy with the exchange of potentially\
    \ sensitive\n       information\n   5.  Implications for Internet architecture\
    \ and next steps\n   The remainder of this report will provide more detail on\
    \ each of\n   these sessions.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Coordination between CSIRTs and Attack Response Mitigation Efforts
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Coordination between CSIRTs and Attack Response Mitigation Efforts\n  \
    \ The first panel session on Coordination between CSIRTs and attack\n   mitigation\
    \ efforts included representatives from several\n   organizations that submitted\
    \ templates describing their\n   organization's attack mitigation efforts.  This\
    \ panel was\n   purposefully a cross section of organizations attending to see\
    \ if\n   there were new opportunities to collaborate and improve efficiency,\n\
    \   thereby better scaling attack mitigation.  The panelists described\n   their\
    \ efforts with the following questions in mind:\n   o  What is the use case for\
    \ their organization?\n   o  Where are they focusing their efforts?\n   o  How\
    \ can others engage with their organization?\n   o  Who participates in their\
    \ organization today?\n   For each of the following organizations, additional\
    \ information can\n   be found in their template submissions [ISOC].\n   The following\
    \ summaries are to be read in the context of the workshop\n   and not as standalone\
    \ descriptions for each organization.  These\n   summaries are a result of the\
    \ workshop discussions.\n   o  ENISA is the European Network and Information Security\
    \ Agency\n      [ENISA].  While ENISA provides support for the community in the\n\
    \      form of education, training, and collaboration on security and\n      attack\
    \ mitigation, it does not offer a service for attack response\n      or mitigation.\n\
    \   o  The Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) offered examples of\n      operator-driven\
    \ exchanges focused on specific use cases that\n      involve hundreds of participating\
    \ organizations daily.  The APWG\n      operates a data clearinghouse and provides\
    \ infrastructure to\n      support meaningful data exchanges and maintains a current\
    \ set of\n      data through these interactions.  More can be learned on the APWG\n\
    \      website [APWG] in addition to their template submission.\n   o  The Research\
    \ and Education Networking Information Sharing and\n      Analysis Center (Ren-ISAC)\
    \ employs an interesting operational\n      model that scales well through automation,\
    \ exchanging actionable\n      information between 500 universities and automatically\n\
    \      implementing controls.  Since many universities cannot respond to\n   \
    \   incidents in real time due to a scarcity of resources, REN-ISAC\n      leverages\
    \ a small number of analysts to accomplish the task of\n      protecting many\
    \ universities through automation.  The key to the\n      success of their project\
    \ is providing tools that allow\n      organizations to make use of incident data\
    \ operationally.  They\n      are currently working to develop open-source tools\
    \ to track\n      metrics more formally [REN-ISAC].\n   o  CERT.br is the Brazilian\
    \ Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)\n      that has made impressive progress\
    \ in a short amount of time.\n      CERT.br is the national focal point for incident\
    \ reporting,\n      collection, and dissemination of threat and attack trend\n\
    \      information in Brazil.  CERT.br works to increase awareness and\n     \
    \ incident-handling capabilities in the country as well as assisting\n      to\
    \ establish new CSIRTs.  In addition to providing training and\n      awareness\
    \ campaigns, they distribute network security honeypots\n      and have a primary\
    \ focus on network monitoring.  CERT.br requires\n      active participation from\
    \ third parties wishing to collaborate and\n      exchange data with them [CERT.BR].\n\
    \   o  MyCERT's mission is to address the security concerns of Malaysian\n   \
    \   Internet users and reduce the probability of successful attacks\n      [MYCERT].\
    \  They have been operational since 1997.  MyCERT is\n      responsible for incident\
    \ handling of unauthorized intrusions,\n      identity theft, DDoS attacks, etc.\
    \  MyCERT handles computer\n      security incidents in Malaysia, provides malware\
    \ research, and\n      technical coordination.  In addition to incident response\
    \ and\n      coordination activities, MyCERT members provide talks and\n     \
    \ training, as well as local and regional security exercises.\n      MyCERT also\
    \ provides incident alerts and advisories on\n      vulnerabilities, breaches,\
    \ etc.\n   o  The CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) has been operational since\n\
    \      1998 on an international and national scale [CERTCC].  They have\n    \
    \  long been known for their software vulnerability work and the\n      national\
    \ vulnerability database in the US (Common Vulnerabilities\n      and Exposures\
    \ -- CVEs) and informing organizations of\n      vulnerabilities.  CERT/CC helps\
    \ to coordinate between vendors and\n      researchers for improved collaborations.\
    \  CERT/CC provides\n      guidance on dealing with the aftermath of incidents,\
    \ risk\n      assessment best practice, bug bounties, and other incident-related\n\
    \      areas.\n   Highlights from the panel discussion:\n   o  Passive surveillance\
    \ by state actors has impacted incident\n      response activities due to the\
    \ erosion of trust between\n      communities.\n   o  Government involvement in\
    \ information exchange efforts has not\n      been productive.  Despite lots of\
    \ discussion, there have not been\n      useful outcomes.\n   o  There is more\
    \ interest in consuming feeds of information than\n      sharing information.\n\
    \   o  Ego has been a big issue for improving data sharing, as have\n      reputation-related\
    \ concerns when sharing or receiving data.\n   o  There is a perception of weakness\
    \ around organizations that share\n      attack information in some regions.\n\
    \   o  Sharing in isolation doesn't help, it must lead to operational\n      return\
    \ on investment.\n   o  Language barriers have been an issue for some national\
    \ CSIRTs.\n   o  Sharing too much information leads to capacity and resource issues\n\
    \      for receiving organizations.  Organizations directly receiving\n      feeds\
    \ can often misinterpret data and think they are under attack\n      when it is\
    \ not the case.  Operational models are preferred where\n      data exchanges\
    \ have a direct impact on improving the efficiency of\n      a small number of\
    \ analysts to impact many.\n   o  Privacy regulations restricting some organizations\
    \ from sharing IP\n      address information have had an impact on the effectiveness\
    \ of\n      incident data exchanges.  ENISA is currently running a study on\n\
    \      this impact (this point was raised by several attendees).\n   o  Too many\
    \ efforts are using data just for blocking attacks and not\n      for operational\
    \ mitigation and elimination of vulnerabilities as\n      part of their incident\
    \ response effort.  Note: Operational efforts\n      stand out in that they do\
    \ eliminate threats and update data\n      warehouses.\n   o  Involvement of vendors\
    \ is needed to better scale attack response.\n      This is not seen as a need\
    \ by all groups, but some sharing groups\n      with an operational focus are\
    \ looking for improved efficiencies to\n      leverage a small number of analysts\
    \ more productively.  Analysts\n      are a limited resource in this technical\
    \ area of expertise.\n   o  Enterprises don't want more security boxes in their\
    \ networks as\n      they don't have the resources to manage them, so involving\
    \ vendors\n      doesn't mean deploying more equipment, but improving automated\n\
    \      controls and the elimination of threats wherever possible.  False\n   \
    \   positives are still an issue, which can be problematic for some\n      automation\
    \ activities.\n"

  - "2.2.  Scaling Response to DDoS and Botnets Effectively and Safely\n   The first\
    \ invited talk at the workshop provided an interesting\n   history of Distributed\
    \ Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks and the\n   evolution of botnets as well as\
    \ the methods to combat these threats.\n   The paper by Dave Dittrich [DD1] is\
    \ available to learn more of this\n   history.  This section of the report will\
    \ focus on the workshop\n   discussion in an effort to benefit from the workshop\
    \ attendees'\n   thoughts concerning how to better scale our response to these\n\
    \   threats.\n   Key points from the discussion:\n   o  Of the attack types discussed,\
    \ DDoS and botnets appear to be the\n      furthest along in terms of efficient\
    \ and effective response.\n      Other efforts can learn from this experience.\
    \  There has not been\n      any interaction between these two attack types that\
    \ may benefit\n      from information exchange tied to remediation activities\
    \ since\n      botnets can be the source of DDoS attacks.\n   o  There is a disparity\
    \ between short-term mitigation goals and\n      actual eradication of DDoS and\
    \ botnet threats.  The question was\n      raised: how do we normalize the same\
    \ data in different ways to\n      serve different goals?  In other words, DDoS\
    \ traffic is often the\n      result of botnets, but the data is not shared between\
    \ the service\n      providers and vendors responding to DDoS threats and those\n\
    \      actively mitigating and eradicating botnets.\n   o  There are ad hoc trust\
    \ groups within the operations security\n      (OPSEC) community today.  The Cybercrime\
    \ Response Advisory Group\n      (CRAG) is one example.\n   o  Filtering and triage\
    \ is an issue, but this is a solvable problem.\n   o  The IETF DDOS Open Threat\
    \ Signaling (DOTS) working group was\n      discussed and compared to a previous\
    \ effort, Real-time Inter-\n      network defense (RID) [RFC6545].  It was stated\
    \ that the two are\n      similar, except DOTS makes use of current data formats\
    \ and\n      protocols and has the support of multiple DDoS vendors.  One of\n\
    \      the goals of DOTS is to have this solution be the \"glue\" between\n  \
    \    vendors to communicate shared data using standard formats and\n      protocols\
    \ developed in open-source tools.\n   o  The IETF Interface to Network Security\
    \ Functions (I2NSF) effort\n      was discussed to explore ways of leveraging\
    \ infrastructure to\n      combat DDoS attacks.\n   o  Vendors discussed existing\
    \ capabilities for DDoS mitigation, while\n      data-sharing groups discussed\
    \ their mitigation activities related\n      to botnets (see the submissions under\
    \ the heading \"Panel on\n      Scaling Attack Response for DDoS and BotNets\"\
    \ in the workshop\n      agenda [AGENDA]).\n   o  Trust and reputation of data\
    \ sources is still a concern.\n   o  One of the exchange groups has a goal of\
    \ \"automated takedowns\" for\n      botnets.  However, they think they will always\
    \ have a need for\n      manual intervention.\n   o  The need for multiple levels\
    \ of trust seemed to be prevalent among\n      those participating in the panel\
    \ discussion.  Intelligence\n      agencies erode trust (this was also mentioned\
    \ in the first panel\n      in terms of surveillance activities from governments).\n\
    \   o  Although trust was discussed in this panel and there are concerns,\n  \
    \    it was noted that trust is not as big a barrier for DDoS and\n      botnet\
    \ mitigation, and this is likely due to the operational\n      experience of the\
    \ participants.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.3.  DNS and RIRs: Attack Response and Mitigation\n   This session was a shift\
    \ from other sessions in the day as the\n   panelists were infrastructure providers\
    \ for those combating attacks.\n   This session was of interest to see how attack\
    \ and incident\n   responders could better collaborate with DNS infrastructure\n\
    \   organizations and RIRs.  These groups have not interacted in the\n   past,\
    \ and it was interesting to see the collaboration opportunities\n   since the\
    \ workshop participants rely on these services to do their\n   jobs.  From the\
    \ panelists' perspective, DNS and RIRs are separate\n   worlds where they spend\
    \ a lot of time trying to educate policy makers\n   about how they work together\
    \ to make the Internet work.\n   Key discussion points:\n   o  The use of passive\
    \ DNS in attack mitigation was described.\n   o  RIRs discussed the data they\
    \ maintain and provide, including\n      worldwide BGP update data and root DNS\
    \ server data.  These\n      datasets are available to share with researchers\
    \ and could be of\n      interest to those working on attack response.  The current\
    \ way the\n      data is made available does not scale, and ideas were discussed\
    \ in\n      the workshop to improve the scalability should this become a more\n\
    \      widely used resource.\n   o  Some of the global RIRs already actively coordinate\
    \ with incident\n      responders in their region.  In some cases, they do facilitate\n\
    \      information sharing as well as provide education and training.\n      Data\
    \ shared out by RIRs is anonymized.\n   o  A concern was raised regarding overlapping\
    \ efforts and a request\n      was made for the IETF and ISOC to pay attention\
    \ to this and help.\n      This workshop was one step toward that in bringing\
    \ together this\n      diverse community.  The participants wished to see this\
    \ type of\n      event repeated for future cross area collaboration between the\n\
    \      diverse set of groups that often only meet within their silo.\n   o  Standards\
    \ for APIs to access data consistently from RIRs and\n      scoring methods were\
    \ discussed as possible ways to scale trust.\n      Questions were raised as to\
    \ how this might be possible.  One might\n      receive unverifiable data about\
    \ a network.  They may be able to\n      verify the source's identity, verify\
    \ route origins, but won't be\n      able to verify the provenance of data.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.4.  Trust Privacy and Data Markings Panel\n   Why don't organizations share\

    \ cultural, and communication\n   issues.  There are also concerns about sharing\
    \ proprietary data with\n   competitors.  Having said that, most of these reasons\

    \ based upon the submitter's reputation.\n   o  The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)\
    \ [TLP] was discussed.  While TLP\n      is useful to some groups who exchange\
    \ data, others find that it is\n      not granular enough for their needs.\n \
    \  o  In many cases, when data is shared, the user never knows, and\n      there\
    \ is no way to manage that disclosure.\n   o  Trust is personal.  When sharing\
    \ circles get too large, trust\n      breaks down.  The personal relationship\
    \ aspect of information\n      sharing communities was emphasized by several who\
    \ are actively\n      exchanging data.  This was a very prevalent theme.\n   o\
    \  A point of comparison was made with consumer goods, and it was\n      observed\
    \ that trademarks are a byproduct of the Industrial\n      Revolution.  The question\
    \ was raised: does trust need branding?\n   o  Observing participants noted that\
    \ there appear to be cabals\n      operating the groups based on the current trust\
    \ notions.  This was\n      not disputed.\n   o  Transparency is vital to maintain\
    \ trust.\n   o  Participants working on automation have found a need to share\
    \ with\n      organizations of all sizes as well as a need to share both\n   \
    \   synchronously and asynchronously.  In an automated model, they\n      must\
    \ ensure data sources are \"authorized\" and these efforts have\n      encountered\
    \ questions about anonymization as well as regional\n      regulatory perspectives\
    \ as they vary.\n   o  Another automation effort found that people have different\
    \ upper\n      limits for trust group scale, which is sometimes based on\n   \
    \   individualized knowledge of other participants and having a\n      comfort\
    \ level with them.  Social interaction (beer) is a common\n      thread amongst\
    \ sharing partners to build trust relationships.  The\n      relationships are\
    \ formed between individuals and not necessarily\n      between organizations.\n\
    \   o  It's rare for any single piece of information to be clearly\n      identifiable\
    \ as private or public.  The temptation is to say that\n      information isn't\
    \ Personally Identifiable Information (PII).  In\n      aggregate, however, non-PII\
    \ can become PII.\n   o  There was common agreement that reputation is fundamental.\n"

  - "3.  Workshop Themes\n   During the course of the day, a couple of themes recurred\
    \ in the\n   discussions.  Firstly, in order to better scale attack response\n\
    \   through improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of\n   information\
    \ exchanges:\n   1.  Exchanging data should not be just for the purpose of creating\n\
    \       blacklists that could be redundant efforts.\n   2.  Involving service\
    \ providers and vendors to better coordinate and\n       scale response is key.\n\
    \   Secondly, information security practitioners are a scarce resource:\n   1.\
    \  Training and education was discussed to improve this gap, both to\n       train\
    \ information security professionals and others in IT on\n       basic network\
    \ and system hygiene.\n   2.  Leveraging resources to better scale response, using\
    \ fewer\n       resources is critical.\n"

- title: 4.1.  RIR and DNS Provider Resources
  contents:
  - "4.1.  RIR and DNS Provider Resources\n   Workshop participants expressed an interest\
    \ in expanded information\n   about the resources and assistance offered by the\
    \ RIRs and DNS\n   providers.  Participants are going to define what is needed.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Education and Guidance
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Education and Guidance\n   Another recurring theme was the lack of knowledge\
    \ in the community\n   about basic security principles such as ingress and egress\
    \ filtering\n   explained in BCP 38 [RFC2827].  The CSIRTs, operators, and vendors\
    \ of\n   attack mitigation tools found this particularly frustrating.  As a\n\
    \   result, follow up activities may include determining if security\n   guidance\
    \ BCPs require updates or to determine whether there are\n   opportunities to\
    \ educate people on these basic principles already\n   documented by the IETF.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Transport Options
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Transport Options\n   One of the more lively discussions was the need for\
    \ better transports\n   for information exchange.  Real-time Inter-network Defense\
    \ (RID)\n   [RFC6545] was published 5 years ago.  While the patterns established\n\
    \   in RID still show promise, there are updated solutions being worked\n   on.\
    \  One such solution is in the IETF DOTS working group that has an\n   approach\
    \ similar to RID with updated formats and protocols to meet\n   the demands of\
    \ today's DDoS attacks.  While Trusted Automated\n   eXchange of Indicator Information\
    \ (TAXII -- another transport option)\n   is just in transition to Organization\
    \ for the Advancement of\n   Structured Information Standards (OASIS), its base\
    \ is similar to RID\n   in its use of SOAP-like messaging, which will likely prevent\
    \ it from\n   scaling to the demands of the Internet.  Vendors also cited several\n\
    \   interoperability challenges of TAXII in workshop discussions.\n   Alternatively,\
    \ XMPP-Grid has been proposed in the IETF Security\n   Automation and Continuous\
    \ Monitoring (SACM) working group and it\n   offers promise as the data exchange\
    \ protocol for deployment at scale.\n   Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol\
    \ (XMPP) [RFC6120]\n   inherently meets the requirements for today's information\
    \ exchanges\n   with features such as publish/subscribe, federation, and use of\
    \ a\n   control channel.  XMPP-Grid is gaining traction with at least 10\n   vendors\
    \ using it in their products and several more planning to add\n   support [APPALA].\
    \  Review and discussion of this document would be\n   helpful as it transitions\
    \ to the Managed Incident Lightweight\n   Exchange (MILE) working group as an\
    \ outcome of the workshop.\n   Representational State Transfer (REST) was also\
    \ brought up as a\n   needed interface because of the low barrier to use [REST].\
    \  The IETF\n   MILE Working Group has discussed a document detailing a common\n\
    \   RESTful interface (ROLIE) that could be used with any data format and\n  \
    \ this may also be of interest [ROLIE].\n"
- title: 4.4.  Updated Template for Information Exchange Groups
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Updated Template for Information Exchange Groups\n   One of the submission\
    \ options was for organizations actively\n   exchanging data to submit a form\
    \ describing their work to reduce\n   computer security incidents.  The CSIRTs,\
    \ in particular, liked having\n   access to this information in a neutral location\
    \ like the Internet\n   Society.  However, they wanted to see amendments to the\
    \ format to\n   improve its usefulness.  There was a desire to have this used\
    \ by\n   additional information exchange groups, thereby creating a living\n \
    \  library to improve awareness about how to become a member, benefit\n   from,\
    \ or contribute to the success of the attack response and CSIRT\n   information\
    \ exchange platforms.\n"
