  - "1.  Introduction\n   It is important to understand which Traffic Engineering\
    \ (TE) links in\n   a given network might be at risk from the same failures. \
    \ In this\n   sense, a set of links can constitute a Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG)\n\
    \   if they share a resource whose failure can affect all links in the\n   set\
    \ [RFC4202].\n   On the other hand, as described in [RFC4206] and [RFC6107], a\n\
    \   Hierarchical LSP (H-LSP) or stitched LSP (S-LSP) can be used for\n   carrying\
    \ one or more other LSPs.  Both the H-LSP and S-LSP can be\n   formed as a TE\
    \ link.  In such cases, it is important to know the SRLG\n   information of the\
    \ LSPs that will be used to carry further LSPs.\n   This document provides a signaling\
    \ mechanism that collects the SRLGs\n   that are used by an LSP and can then be\
    \ advertised as properties of\n   the TE link formed by that LSP.\n"

    \                      Figure 1: Dual-Homing Configuration\n   Single-homed customer\
    \ edge (CE) devices are connected to a single\n   provider edge (PE) device via\
    \ a single UNI link (which could be a\n   bundle of parallel links, typically\
    \ using the same fiber cable).\n   This single UNI link can constitute a single\
    \ point of failure.  Such\n   a single point of failure can be avoided if the\
    \ CE device is\n   connected to two PE devices via two UNI interfaces for CE1\
    \ and CE2,\n   respectively, as depicted in Figure 1.\n   For the dual-homing\
    \ case, it is possible to establish two connections\n   (LSPs) from the source\
    \ CE device to the same destination CE device\n   where one connection is using\
    \ one UNI link to PE1, for example, and\n   the other connection is using the\
    \ UNI link to PE2.  In order to avoid\n   single points of failure within the\
    \ provider network, it is necessary\n   to also ensure path (LSP) diversity within\
    \ the provider network to\n   achieve end-to-end diversity for the two LSPs between\
    \ the two CE\n   devices CE1 and CE2.  This use case describes how it is possible\
    \ to\n   achieve path diversity within the provider network based on collected\n\
    \   SRLG information.  As the two connections (LSPs) enter the provider\n   network\
    \ at different PE devices, the PE device that receives the\n   connection request\
    \ for the second connection needs to know the\n   additional path computation\
    \ constraints such that the path of the\n   second LSP is disjoint with respect\
    \ to the already established first\n   connection.\n   As SRLG information is\
    \ normally not shared between the provider\n   network and the client network,\
    \ i.e., between PE and CE devices, the\n   challenge is how to solve the diversity\
    \ problem when a CE is dual-\n   homed.  The RSVP extensions for collecting SRLG\
    \ information defined\n   in this document make it possible to retrieve SRLG information\
    \ for an\n   LSP and hence solve the dual-homing LSP diversity problem.  For\n\
    \   example, CE1 in Figure 1 may have requested an LSP1 to CE2 via PE1\n   that\
    \ is routed via PE3 to CE2.  CE1 can then subsequently request an\n   LSP2 to\
    \ CE2 via PE2 with the constraint that it needs to be maximally\n   SRLG disjoint\
    \ with respect to LSP1.  PE2, however, does not have any\n   SRLG information\
    \ associated with LSP1, and this is needed as input\n   for its constraint-based\
    \ path computation function.  If CE1 is\n   capable of retrieving the SRLG information\
    \ associated with LSP1 from\n   PE1, it can pass this discovered information to\
    \ PE2 as part of the\n   LSP2 setup request (RSVP PATH message) in an EXCLUDE_ROUTE\
    \ Object\n   (XRO) or Explicit Exclusion Route Subobject (EXRS) as described in\n\
    \   [RFC4874], and PE2 can now calculate a path for LSP2 that is SRLG\n   disjoint\
    \ with respect to LSP1.  The SRLG information associated with\n   LSP1 can be\
    \ retrieved when LSP1 is established or at any time before\n   LSP2 is set up.\n\
    \   When CE1 sends the setup request for LSP2 to PE2, it can also request\n  \
    \ the collection of SRLG information for LSP2 and send that information\n   to\
    \ PE1 by re-signaling LSP1 with SRLG-exclusion based on LSP2's\n   discovered\
    \ SRLGs.  This will ensure that the two paths for the two\n   LSPs remain mutually\
    \ diverse; this is important when the provider\n   network is capable of restoring\
    \ connections that failed due to a\n   network failure (fiber cut) in the provider\
    \ network.\n   Note that the knowledge of SRLG information even for multiple LSPs\n\
    \   does not allow a CE device to derive the provider network topology\n   based\
    \ on the collected SRLG information.  It would, however, be\n   possible for an\
    \ entity controlling multiple CE devices to derive some\n   information related\
    \ to the topology.  This document therefore allows\n   PE devices to control the\
    \ communication of SRLGs outside the provider\n   network if desired.\n"

    \ of SRLG information to the RRO would result in the\n   RRO exceeding its maximum\
    \ possible size or becoming too large for the\n   Path message to contain it,\
    \ the requested SRLGs MUST NOT be added.\n   If the SRLG collection request was\
    \ contained in an\n   LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object, the processing node MUST\
    \ behave as\n   specified by [RFC3209] and drop the RRO from the Path message\n\
    \   entirely.  If the SRLG collection request was contained in an\n   LSP_ATTRIBUTES\
    \ object, the processing node MAY omit some or all of\n   the requested SRLGs\
    \ from the RRO; otherwise, it MUST behave as\n   specified by [RFC3209] and drop\
    \ the RRO from the Path message\n   entirely.  Subsequent processing of the LSP\
    \ proceeds as further\n   specified in [RFC3209].\n   Following the steps described\
    \ above, the intermediate nodes of the\n   LSP can collect the SRLG information\
    \ in the RRO during the processing\n   of the Path message hop by hop.  When the\
    \ Path message arrives at the\n   egress node, the egress node receives SRLG information\
    \ in the RRO.\n   Per [RFC3209], when issuing a Resv message for a Path message\
    \ that\n   contains an RRO, an egress node initiates the RRO process by adding\n\
    \   an RRO to the outgoing Resv message.  The processing for RROs\n   contained\
    \ in Resv messages then mirrors that of the Path messages.\n   When a node receives\
    \ a Resv message for an LSP for which SRLG\n   Collection was specified in the\
    \ corresponding Path message, then when\n   local policy allows recording SRLG\
    \ information, the node MUST add\n   SRLG information to the RRO of the corresponding\
    \ outgoing Resv\n   message as specified below.  When the Resv message arrives\
    \ at the\n   ingress node, the ingress node can extract the SRLG information from\n\
    \   the RRO in the same way as the egress node.\n   Note that a link's SRLG information\
    \ for the upstream direction cannot\n   be assumed to be the same as that for\
    \ the downstream direction.\n   o  For Path and Resv messages for a unidirectional\
    \ LSP, a node SHOULD\n      include SRLG subobjects in the RRO for the downstream\
    \ data link\n      only.\n   o  For Path and Resv messages for a bidirectional\
    \ LSP, a node SHOULD\n      include SRLG subobjects in the RRO for both the upstream\
    \ data link\n      and the downstream data link from the local node.  In this\
    \ case,\n      the node MUST include the information in the same order for both\n\
    \      Path messages and Resv messages.  That is, the SRLG subobject for\n   \
    \   the upstream link is added to the RRO before the SRLG subobject\n      for\
    \ the downstream link.\n      If SRLG data is added for both the upstream and\
    \ downstream links,\n      the two sets of SRLG data MUST be added in separate\
    \ SRLG\n      subobjects.  A single SRLG subobject MUST NOT contain a mixture\
    \ of\n      upstream and downstream SRLGs.  When adding a SRLG subobject to an\n\
    \      RRO, the D-bit MUST be set appropriately to indicate the direction\n  \
    \    of the SRLGs.  If an SRLG ID applies in both directions, it SHOULD\n    \
    \  be added to both the upstream and downstream SRLG subobjects.\n   Based on\
    \ the above procedure, the endpoints can get the SRLG\n   information automatically.\
    \  Then, for instance, the endpoints can\n   advertise it as a TE link to the\
    \ routing instance based on the\n   procedure described in [RFC6107] and configure\
    \ the SRLG information\n   of the Forwarding Adjacency (FA) automatically.\n"
