  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) problem statement\n\
    \   [RFC7340] identifies the primary enabler of robocalling, vishing\n   (voicemail\
    \ hacking), swatting, and related attacks as the capability\n   to impersonate\
    \ a calling party number.  The starkest examples of\n   these attacks are cases\
    \ where automated callees on the Public\n   Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)\
    \ rely on the calling number as a\n   security measure -- for example, to access\
    \ a voicemail system.\n   Robocallers use impersonation as a means of obscuring\
    \ identity.\n   While robocallers can, in the ordinary PSTN, block (that is,\n\
    \   withhold) their caller identity, callees are less likely to pick up\n   calls\
    \ from blocked identities; therefore, appearing to call from some\n   number,\
    \ any number, is preferable.  Robocallers, however, prefer not\n   to call from\
    \ a number that can trace back to the robocaller, and\n   therefore they impersonate\
    \ numbers that are not assigned to them.\n   One of the most important components\
    \ of a system to prevent\n   impersonation is the implementation of credentials\
    \ that identify the\n   parties who control telephone numbers.  With these credentials,\n\
    \   parties can assert that they are in fact authorized to use telephony\n   numbers\
    \ (TNs), and thus they distinguish themselves from\n   impersonators unable to\
    \ present such credentials.  For that reason,\n   the STIR threat model [RFC7375]\
    \ stipulates that \"The design of the\n   credential system envisioned as a solution\
    \ to these threats must, for\n   example, limit the scope of the credentials issued\
    \ to carriers or\n   national authorities to those numbers that fall under their\
    \ purview.\"\n   This document describes credential systems for telephone numbers\n\
    \   based on [X.509] version 3 certificates in accordance with [RFC5280].\n  \
    \ While telephone numbers have long been part of the X.509 standard\n   (X.509\
    \ supports arbitrary naming attributes to be included in a\n   certificate; the\
    \ telephoneNumber attribute was defined in the 1988\n   [X.520] specification),\
    \ this document provides ways to determine\n   authority more aligned with telephone\
    \ network requirements, including\n   extending X.509 with a Telephony Number\
    \ Authorization List\n   certificate extension, which binds certificates to asserted\
    \ authority\n   for particular telephone numbers or, potentially, telephone number\n\
    \   blocks or ranges.\n   In the STIR in-band architecture specified in [RFC8224],\
    \ two basic\n   types of entities need access to these credentials: authentication\n\
    \   services and verification services (or verifiers).  An authentication\n  \
    \ service must be operated by an entity enrolled with the certification\n   authority\
    \ (CA) (see Section 5), whereas a verifier need only trust\n   the trust anchor\
    \ of the authority and also have a means to access and\n   validate the public\
    \ keys associated with these certificates.\n   Although the guidance in this document\
    \ is written with the STIR\n   in-band architecture in mind, the credential system\
    \ described in this\n   document could be useful for other protocols that want\
    \ to make use of\n   certificates to assert authority over telephone numbers on\
    \ the\n   Internet.\n   This document specifies only the credential syntax and\
    \ semantics\n   necessary to support this architecture.  It does not assume any\n\
    \   particular CA or deployment environment.  We anticipate that some\n   deployment\
    \ experience will be necessary to determine optimal\n   operational models.\n"

- title: 3.  Authority for Telephone Numbers in Certificates
  contents:
  - "3.  Authority for Telephone Numbers in Certificates\n   At a high level, this\
    \ specification details two non-exclusive\n   approaches that can be employed\
    \ to determine authority over telephone\n   numbers with certificates.\n   The\
    \ first approach is to leverage the existing subject of the\n   certificate to\
    \ ascertain that the holder of the certificate is\n   authorized to claim authority\
    \ over a telephone number.  The subject\n   might be represented as a domain name\
    \ in the subjectAltName, such as\n   an \"example.net\" where that domain is known\
    \ to relying parties as a\n   carrier, or represented with other identifiers related\
    \ to the\n   operation of the telephone network, including Service Provider Codes\n\
    \   (SPCs) such as Operating Company Numbers (OCNs) or Service Provider\n   Identifiers\
    \ (SPIDs) via the TN Authorization List specified in this\n   document.  A relying\
    \ party could then employ an external data set or\n   service that determines\
    \ whether or not a specific telephone number is\n   under the authority of the\
    \ carrier identified as the subject of the\n   certificate and use that to ascertain\
    \ whether or not the carrier\n   should have authority over a telephone number.\
    \  Potentially, a\n   certificate extension to convey the URI of such an information\n\
    \   service trusted by the issuer of the certificate could be developed\n   (though\
    \ this specification does not propose one).  Alternatively,\n   some relying parties\
    \ could form bilateral or multilateral trust\n   relationships with peer carriers,\
    \ trusting one another's assertions\n   just as telephone carriers in the Signaling\
    \ System 7 (SS7) network\n   today rely on transitive trust when displaying the\
    \ calling party\n   telephone number received through SS7 signaling.\n   The second\
    \ approach is to extend the syntax of certificates to\n   include a new attribute,\
    \ defined here as the TN Authorization List,\n   which contains a list of telephone\
    \ numbers defining the scope of\n   authority of the certificate.  Relying parties,\
    \ if they trust the\n   issuer of the certificate as a source of authoritative\
    \ information on\n   telephone numbers, could therefore use the TN Authorization\
    \ List\n   instead of the subject of the certificate to make a decision about\n\
    \   whether or not the signer has authority over a particular telephone\n   number.\
    \  The TN Authorization List could be provided in one of two\n   ways: as a literal\
    \ value in the certificate or as a network service\n   that allows relying parties\
    \ to query in real time to determine that a\n   telephone number is in the scope\
    \ of a certificate.  Using the TN\n   Authorization List rather than the certificate\
    \ subject makes sense\n   when, for example, for privacy reasons the certificate\
    \ owner would\n   prefer not to be identified, or in cases where the holder of\
    \ the\n   certificate does not participate in the sort of traditional carrier\n\
    \   infrastructure that the first approach assumes.\n   The first approach requires\
    \ little change to existing Public Key\n   Infrastructure (PKI) certificates;\
    \ for the second approach, we must\n   define an appropriate enrollment and authorization\
    \ process.  For the\n   purposes of STIR, the over-the-wire format specified in\
    \ [RFC8224]\n   accommodates either of these approaches: the methods for\n   canonicalizing,\
    \ for signing, for identifying and accessing the\n   certificate, and so on remain\
    \ the same; it is only the verifier\n   behavior and authorization decision that\
    \ will change, depending on\n   the approach to telephone number authority taken\
    \ by the certificate.\n   For that reason, the two approaches are not mutually\
    \ exclusive, and\n   in fact a certificate issued to a traditional telephone network\n\
    \   service provider could contain a TN Authorization List or not, were\n   it\
    \ supported by the CA issuing the credential.  Regardless of which\n   approach\
    \ is used, certificates that assert authority over telephone\n   numbers are subject\
    \ to the ordinary operational procedures that\n   govern certificate use per [RFC5280].\
    \  This means that verification\n   services must be mindful of the need to ensure\
    \ that they trust the\n   trust anchor that issued the certificate and that they\
    \ have some\n   means to determine the freshness of the certificate (see Section\
    \ 10).\n"
- title: 4.  Certificate Usage with STIR
  contents:
  - "4.  Certificate Usage with STIR\n   [RFC8224], Section 7.4 requires that all\
    \ credential systems used by\n   STIR explain how they address the requirements\
    \ enumerated below.\n   Certificates as described in this document address the\
    \ STIR\n   requirements as follows:\n   1.  The URI [RFC3986] schemes permitted\
    \ in the SIP Identity header\n       \"info\" parameter, as well as any special\
    \ procedures required to\n       dereference the URIs: while normative text is\
    \ given below in\n       Section 7, this mechanism permits the HTTP [RFC7230],\
    \ CID\n       (Content-ID) [RFC2392], and SIP URI schemes to appear in the\n \
    \      \"info\" parameter.\n   2.  Procedures required to extract keying material\
    \ from the resources\n       designated by the URI: implementations perform no\
    \ special\n       procedures beyond dereferencing the \"info\" URI.  See Section\
    \ 7.\n   3.  Procedures used by the verification service to determine the\n  \
    \     scope of the credential: this specification effectively proposes\n     \
    \  two methods, as outlined in Section 3: one where the subject (or,\n       more\
    \ properly, subjectAltName) of the certificate indicates the\n       scope of\
    \ authority through a domain name, and relying parties\n       either trust the\
    \ subject entirely or have some direct means of\n       determining whether or\
    \ not a number falls under a subject's\n       authority; and another where an\
    \ extension to the certificate as\n       described in Section 9 identifies the\
    \ scope of authority of the\n       certificate.\n   4.  The cryptographic algorithms\
    \ required to validate the\n       credentials: for this specification, that means\
    \ the signature\n       algorithms used to sign certificates.  This specification\n\
    \       REQUIRES that implementations support both the Elliptic Curve\n      \
    \ Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with the P-256 curve (see\n       [DSS])\
    \ and RSA PKCS #1 v1.5 (\"PKCS\" stands for \"Public-Key\n       Cryptography\
    \ Standards\") (see [RFC8017], Section 8.2) for\n       certificate signatures.\
    \  Implementers are advised that the latter\n       algorithm is mandated only\
    \ as a transitional mechanism, due to\n       its widespread use in existing PKIs,\
    \ but we anticipate that this\n       mechanism will eventually be deprecated.\n\
    \   5.  Finally, note that all certificates compliant with this\n       specification:\n\
    \       *  MUST provide cryptographic keying material sufficient to\n        \
    \  generate the ECDSA using P-256 and SHA-256 signatures\n          necessary\
    \ to support the ES256 hashed signatures required by\n          PASSporT [RFC8225],\
    \ which in turn follows the JSON Web Token\n          (JWT) [RFC7519].\n     \
    \  *  MUST support both ECDSA with P-256 and RSA PKCS #1 v1.5 for\n          certificate\
    \ signature verification.\n   This document also includes additional certificate-related\n\
    \   requirements:\n   o  See Section 5.1 for requirements related to the JWT Claim\n\
    \      Constraints certificate extension.\n   o  See Section 7 for requirements\
    \ related to relying parties\n      acquiring credentials.\n   o  See Sections\
    \ 10 and 10.1 for requirements related to certificate\n      freshness and the\
    \ Authority Information Access (AIA) certificate\n      extension.\n"
- title: 5.  Enrollment and Authorization Using the TN Authorization List
  contents:
  - "5.  Enrollment and Authorization Using the TN Authorization List\n   This document\
    \ covers three models for enrollment when using the TN\n   Authorization List\
    \ extension.\n   The first enrollment model is one where the CA acts in concert\
    \ with\n   national numbering authorities to issue credentials to those parties\n\
    \   to whom numbers are assigned.  In the United States, for example,\n   telephone\
    \ number blocks are assigned to Local Exchange Carriers\n   (LECs) by the North\
    \ American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA),\n   who is in turn directed\
    \ by the national regulator.  LECs may also\n   receive numbers in smaller allocations,\
    \ through number pooling, or\n   via an individual assignment through number portability.\
    \  LECs assign\n   numbers to customers, who may be private individuals or organizations\n\
    \   -- and organizations take responsibility for assigning numbers within\n  \
    \ their own enterprise.  This model requires top-down adoption of the\n   model\
    \ from regulators through to carriers.  Assignees of E.164\n   numbering resources\
    \ participating in this enrollment model should\n   take appropriate steps to\
    \ establish trust anchors.\n   The second enrollment model is a bottom-up approach\
    \ where a CA\n   requires that an entity prove control by means of some sort of\
    \ test\n   that, as with certification authorities for web PKI, might either be\n\
    \   (1) automated or (2) a manual administrative process.  As an example\n   of\
    \ an automated process, an authority might send a text message to a\n   telephone\
    \ number containing a URL (which might be dereferenced by the\n   recipient) as\
    \ a means of verifying that a user has control of a\n   terminal corresponding\
    \ to that number.  Checks of this form are\n   frequently used in commercial systems\
    \ today to validate telephone\n   numbers provided by users.  This is comparable\
    \ to existing enrollment\n   systems used by some certificate authorities for\
    \ issuing S/MIME\n   credentials for email by verifying that the party applying\
    \ for a\n   credential receives mail at the email address in question.\n   The\
    \ third enrollment model is delegation: that is, the holder of a\n   certificate\
    \ (assigned by either of the two methods above) might\n   delegate some or all\
    \ of their authority to another party.  In some\n   cases, multiple levels of\
    \ delegation could occur: a LEC, for example,\n   might delegate authority to\
    \ a customer organization for a block of\n   100 numbers used by an IP PBX, and\
    \ the organization might in turn\n   delegate authority for a particular number\
    \ to an individual employee.\n   This is analogous to delegation of organizational\
    \ identities in\n   traditional hierarchical PKIs who use the name constraints\
    \ extension\n   [RFC5280]; the root CA delegates names in sales to the sales\n\
    \   department CA, names in development to the development CA, etc.  As\n   lengthy\
    \ certificate delegation chains are brittle, however, and can\n   cause delays\
    \ in the verification process, this document considers\n   optimizations to reduce\
    \ the complexity of verification.\n   Future work might explore methods of partial\
    \ delegation, where\n   certificate holders delegate only part of their authority.\
    \  For\n   example, individual assignees may want to delegate to a service\n \
    \  authority for text messages associated with their telephone number\n   but\
    \ not for other functions.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Constraints on Signing PASSporTs
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Constraints on Signing PASSporTs\n   The public key in the certificate\
    \ is used to validate the signature\n   on a JWT [RFC7519] that conforms to the\
    \ conventions specified in\n   PASSporT [RFC8225].  This specification supports\
    \ constraints on the\n   JWT claims, thereby allowing the CA to grant different\
    \ permissions to\n   certificate holders -- for example, those enrolled from\n\
    \   proof-of-possession versus delegation.  A Certificate Policy (CP) and\n  \
    \ a Certification Practice Statement (CPS) [RFC3647] are produced as\n   part\
    \ of the normal PKI bootstrapping process (i.e., the CP is written\n   first,\
    \ and then the CA says how it conforms to the CP in the CPS).  A\n   CA that wishes\
    \ to place constraints on the JWT claims MUST include\n   the JWT Claim Constraints\
    \ certificate extension in issued\n   certificates.  See Section 8 for information\
    \ about the certificate\n   extension.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Certificate Extension Scope and Structure
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Certificate Extension Scope and Structure\n   This specification places\
    \ no limits on the number of telephone\n   numbers that can be associated with\
    \ any given certificate.  Some\n   service providers may be assigned millions\
    \ of numbers and may wish to\n   have a single certificate that can be applied\
    \ to signing for any one\n   of those numbers.  Others may wish to compartmentalize\
    \ authority over\n   subsets of the numbers they control.\n   Moreover, service\
    \ providers may wish to have multiple certificates\n   with the same scope of\
    \ authority.  For example, a service provider\n   with several regional gateway\
    \ systems may want each system to be\n   capable of signing for each of their\
    \ numbers but not want to have\n   each system share the same private key.\n \
    \  The set of telephone numbers for which a particular certificate is\n   valid\
    \ is expressed in the certificate through a certificate\n   extension; the certificate's\
    \ extensibility mechanism is defined in\n   [RFC5280], but the TN Authorization\
    \ List extension is specified in\n   this document.\n   The subjects of certificates\
    \ containing the TN Authorization List\n   extension are typically the administrative\
    \ entities to whom numbers\n   are assigned or delegated.  For example, a LEC\
    \ might hold a\n   certificate for a range of telephone numbers.  In some cases,\
    \ the\n   organization or individual issued such a certificate may not want to\n\
    \   associate themselves with a certificate; for example, a private\n   individual\
    \ with a certificate for a single telephone number might not\n   want to distribute\
    \ that certificate publicly if every verifier\n   immediately knew their name.\
    \  The certification authorities issuing\n   certificates with the TN Authorization\
    \ List extensions may, in\n   accordance with their policies, obscure the identity\
    \ of the subject,\n   though mechanisms for doing so are outside the scope of\
    \ this\n   document.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  Provisioning Private Keying Material\n   In order for authentication services\
    \ to sign calls via the procedures\n   described in [RFC8224], they must hold\
    \ a private key corresponding to\n   a certificate with authority over the calling\
    \ number.  [RFC8224]\n   does not require that any particular entity in a SIP\
    \ deployment\n   architecture sign requests, only that it be an entity with an\n\
    \   appropriate private key; the authentication service role may be\n   instantiated\
    \ by any entity in a SIP network.  For a certificate\n   granting authority only\
    \ over a particular number that has been issued\n   to an end user, for example,\
    \ an end-user device might hold the\n   private key and generate the signature.\
    \  In the case of a service\n   provider with authority over large blocks of numbers,\

- title: 7.  Acquiring Credentials to Verify Signatures
  contents:
  - "7.  Acquiring Credentials to Verify Signatures\n   This specification documents\
    \ multiple ways that a verifier can gain\n   access to the credentials needed\
    \ to verify a request.  As the\n   validity of certificates does not depend on\
    \ the method of their\n   acquisition, there is no need to standardize any single\
    \ mechanism for\n   this purpose.  All entities that comply with [RFC8224] necessarily\n\
    \   support SIP, and consequently SIP itself can serve as a way to\n   deliver\
    \ certificates.  [RFC8224] provides an \"info\" parameter of the\n   Identity\
    \ header; this parameter contains a URI for the credential\n   used to generate\
    \ the Identity header.  [RFC8224] also requires that\n   documents that define\
    \ credential systems list the URI schemes that\n   may be present in the \"info\"\
    \ parameter.  For implementations\n   compliant with this specification, three\
    \ URI schemes are REQUIRED:\n   the CID URI, the SIP URI, and the HTTP URI.\n\
    \   The simplest way for a verifier to acquire the certificate needed to\n   verify\
    \ a signature is for the certificate to be conveyed in a\n   SIP request along\
    \ with the signature itself.  In SIP, for example, a\n   certificate could be\
    \ carried in a multipart MIME body [RFC2046], and\n   the URI in the Identity\
    \ header \"info\" parameter could specify that\n   body with a CID URI [RFC2392].\
    \  However, in many environments this\n   is not feasible due to message size\
    \ restrictions or lack of necessary\n   support for multipart MIME.\n   The Identity\

    \ number or number range.  The\n   non-critical TN Authorization List certificate\
    \ extension is included\n   in the certificate's extension field [RFC5280].  The\

    \ phone numbers for the call setup signer.  It indicates one\n   or more blocks\
    \ of telephone number entries that have been authorized\n   for use by the call\
    \ setup signer.  There are three ways to identify\n   the block:\n   1.  SPCs\
    \ as described in this document are a generic term for the\n       identifiers\
    \ used to designate service providers in telephone\n       networks today.  In\
    \ North American context, these would include\n       OCNs as specified in [ATIS-0300251],\
    \ related SPIDs, or other\n       similar identifiers for service providers. \
    \ SPCs can be used to\n       indirectly name all of the telephone numbers associated\
    \ with that\n       identifier for a service provider.\n   2.  Telephone numbers\
    \ can be listed in a range (in the\n       TelephoneNumberRange format), which\
    \ consists of a starting\n       telephone number and then an integer count of\
    \ numbers within the\n       range, where the valid boundaries of ranges may vary\
    \ according to\n       national policies.  The count field is only applicable\
    \ to start\n       fields whose values do not include \"*\" or \"#\" (i.e., a\n\
    \       TelephoneNumber that does not include \"*\" or \"#\").  count\n      \
    \ MUST NOT make the number increase in length (i.e., a\n       TelephoneNumberRange\
    \ with TelephoneNumber=10 and count=91 is\n       invalid); formally, given the\
    \ inputs count and TelephoneNumber of\n       length D, TelephoneNumber + count\
    \ MUST be less than 10^D.\n   3.  A single telephone number can be listed (as\
    \ a TelephoneNumber).\n   Note that because large-scale service providers may\
    \ want to associate\n   many numbers, possibly millions of numbers, with a particular\n\
    \   certificate, optimizations are required for those cases to prevent\n   the\
    \ certificate size from becoming unmanageable.  In these cases, the\n   TN Authorization\
    \ List may be given by reference rather than by value,\n   through the presence\
    \ of a separate certificate extension that permits\n   verifiers to either (1)\
    \ securely download the list of numbers\n   associated with a certificate or (2)\
    \ verify that a single number is\n   under the authority of this certificate.\
    \  For more on this\n   optimization, see Section 10.1.\n"
- title: 10.  Certificate Freshness and Revocation
  contents:
  - "10.  Certificate Freshness and Revocation\n   Regardless of which of the approaches\
    \ in Section 3 is followed for\n   using certificates, a certificate verification\
    \ mechanism is required.\n   However, the traditional problem of certificate freshness\
    \ gains a new\n   wrinkle when using the TN Authorization List extension with\
    \ telephone\n   numbers or number ranges (as opposed to SPCs), because verifiers\
    \ must\n   establish not only that a certificate remains valid but also that the\n\
    \   certificate's scope contains the telephone number that the verifier\n   is\
    \ validating.  Dynamic changes to number assignments can occur due\n   to number\
    \ portability, for example.  So, even if a verifier has a\n   valid cached certificate\
    \ for a telephone number (or a range\n   containing the number), the verifier\
    \ must determine that the entity\n   that created the PASSporT, which includes\
    \ a digital signature, is\n   still a proper authority for that number.\n   To\
    \ verify the status of such a certificate, the verifier needs to\n   acquire the\
    \ certificate if necessary (via the methods described in\n   Section 7) and then\
    \ would need to either:\n   a.  Rely on short-lived certificates and not check\
    \ the certificate's\n       status, or\n   b.  Rely on status information from\
    \ the authority (e.g., the Online\n       Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)).\n\
    \   The trade-off between short-lived certificates and using status\n   information\
    \ is that the former's burden is on the front end (i.e.,\n   enrollment) and the\
    \ latter's burden is on the back end (i.e.,\n   verification).  Both impact call\
    \ setup time, but some approaches to\n   generating a short-lived certificate,\
    \ like requiring one for each\n   call, would incur a greater operational cost\
    \ than acquiring status\n   information.  This document makes no particular recommendation\
    \ for a\n   means of determining certificate freshness for STIR, as this requires\n\
    \   further study and implementation experience.  Acquiring online status\n  \
    \ information for certificates has the potential to disclose private\n   information\
    \ [RFC7258] if proper precautions are not taken.  Future\n   specifications that\
    \ define certificate freshness mechanisms for STIR\n   MUST note any such risks\
    \ and provide countermeasures where possible.\n"
- title: 10.1.  Acquiring the TN List by Reference
  contents:
  - "10.1.  Acquiring the TN List by Reference\n   One alternative to checking certificate\
    \ status for a particular\n   telephone number is simply acquiring the TN Authorization\
    \ List by\n   reference, that is, through dereferencing a URL in the certificate,\n\
    \   rather than including the value of the TN Authorization List in the\n   certificate\
    \ itself.\n   Acquiring a list of the telephone numbers associated with a\n  \
    \ certificate or its subject lends itself to an application-layer\n   query/response\
    \ interaction outside of certificate status, one that\n   could be initiated through\
    \ a separate URI included in the\n   certificate.  The AIA extension (see [RFC5280])\
    \ supports such a\n   mechanism: it designates an OID to identify the accessMethod\
    \ and an\n   accessLocation, which would most likely be a URI.  A verifier would\n\
    \   then follow the URI to ascertain whether the TNs in the list are\n   authorized\
    \ for use by the caller.  As with the certificate extension\n   defined in Section\
    \ 9, a URI dereferenced from an end-entity\n   certificate will indicate the TNs\
    \ that the caller has been\n   authorized.  Verifiers MUST support the AIA extension,\
    \ and the\n   dereferenced URI from a CA certificate limits the set of TNs for\n\
    \   certification paths that include this certificate.\n   HTTPS is the most obvious\
    \ candidate for a protocol to be used for\n   fetching the list of telephone numbers\
    \ associated with a particular\n   certificate.  This document defines a new AIA\
    \ accessMethod, called\n   \"id-ad-stirTNList\", which uses the following AIA\
    \ OID:\n     id-ad-stirTNList  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ad 14 }\n   When the\
    \ \"id-ad-stirTNList\" accessMethod is used, the accessLocation\n   MUST be an\
    \ HTTPS URI.  Dereferencing the URI will return the complete\n   DER-encoded TN\
    \ Authorization List (see Section 9) for the certificate\n   with a Content-Type\
    \ of application/tnauthlist (see Section 11.2).\n   Delivering the entire list\
    \ of telephone numbers associated with a\n   particular certificate will divulge\
    \ to STIR verifiers information\n   about telephone numbers other than the one\
    \ associated with the\n   particular call that the verifier is checking.  In some\
    \ environments,\n   where STIR verifiers handle a high volume of calls, maintaining\
    \ an\n   up-to-date and complete cache for the numbers associated with crucial\n\
    \   certificate holders could give an important boost to performance.\n"
