  contents:
  - "2.1  Motivation\n   Wide-area transit networks (such as the NSFNET regionals)\
    \ often have\n   connections to moderately-complex \"leaf\" sites.  A leaf site\
    \ may have\n   multiple IP network numbers assigned to it.\n   Typically, one\
    \ of the leaf site's networks is directly connected to a\n   router provided and\
    \ administered by the transit network while the\n   others are distributed throughout\
    \ and administered by the site.  From\n   the transit network's perspective, all\
    \ of the network numbers\n   associated with the site make up a single \"stub\"\
    \ entity.  For\n   example, BARRNet has one site composed of a class-B network,\n\
    \   130.57.0.0, and a class-C network, 192.31.114.0.  From BARRNet's\n   perspective,\
    \ this configuration looks something like this:\n                    192.31.114\n\
    \                        |\n                      (cloud)\n                  --------------\
    \ 130.57.4\n                        |\n                        |\n           \
    \          ------ 131.119.13 ------\n                     |BR18|------------|BR10|\n\
    \                     ------            ------\n                             \
    \             |\n                                          V\n               \
    \                   to BARRNet \"core\" OSPF system\n   where the \"cloud\" consists\
    \ of the subnets of 130.57 and network\n   192.31.114, all of which are learned\
    \ by RIP on router BR18.\n   Topologically, this cloud looks very much like an\
    \ OSPF stub area.\n   The advantages of running the cloud as an OSPF stub area\
    \ are:\n             1. Type-5 routes (OSPF external link-state advertisements\n\
    \                (LSAs)) are not advertised beyond the router\n              \
    \  labeled \"BR10\". This is advantageous because the\n                link between\
    \ BR10 and BR18 may be a low-speed link\n                or the router BR18 may\
    \ have limited resources.\n             2. The transit network is abstracted to\
    \ the \"leaf\"\n                router BR18 by advertising only a default route\n\
    \                across the link between BR10 and BR18.\n             3. The cloud\
    \ becomes a single, manageable \"leaf\" with\n                respect to the transit\
    \ network.\n             4. The cloud can become, logically, a part of the transit\n\
    \                network's OSPF routing system.\n             5. Translated type-5\
    \ LSAs that are sent into the\n                backbone from the cloud (which\
    \ is a separate\n                stub area) may be considered \"leaf\" nodes\n\
    \                when performing the Dijkstra calculation.\n   However, the current\
    \ definition of the OSPF protocol [1] imposes\n   topological limitations which\
    \ restrict simple cloud topologies from\n   becoming OSPF stub areas.  In particular,\
    \ it is illegal for a stub\n   area to import routes external to OSPF; it is not\
    \ possible for\n   routers BR18 and BR10 to both be members of the stub area and\
    \ to\n   import the routes learned from RIP or other IP routing protocols as\n\
    \   type-5 (OSPF external LSAs) into the OSPF system.  In order to run\n   OSPF\
    \ out to BR18, BR18 must be a member of a non-stub area or the\n   OSPF backbone\
    \ to import routes other than its directly-connected\n   network(s).  Since it\
    \ is not acceptable for BR18 to maintain all of\n   BARRNet's external (type-5)\
    \ routes, BARRNet is forced by OSPF's\n   topological limitations to run OSPF\
    \ out to BR10 and to run RIP\n   between BR18 and BR10.\n"
- title: 2.2 Proposed Solution
  contents:
  - "2.2 Proposed Solution\n   This document describes a new optional type of OSPF\
    \ area, somewhat\n   humorously referred to as a \"not-so-stubby\" area (or NSSA)\
    \ which has\n   the capability of importing external routes in a limited fashion.\n\
    \   The OSPF specification defines two general classes of area\n   configuration.\
    \  The first allows type-5 LSAs to be flooded throughout\n   the area.  In this\
    \ configuration, type-5 LSAs may be originated by\n   routers internal to the\
    \ area or flooded into the area by area border\n   routers.  These areas, referred\
    \ to herein as type-5 capable areas (or\n   just plain areas in the OSPF spec),\
    \ are distinguished by the fact\n   that they can carry transit traffic.  The\
    \ backbone is always a type-5\n   capable area.  The second type of area configuration,\
    \ called stub,\n   allows no type-5 LSAs to be propagated into/throughout the\
    \ area and\n   instead depends on default routing to external destinations.\n\
    \   NSSAs are defined in much the same manner as existing stub areas.  To\n  \
    \ support NSSAs, a new option bit (the \"N\" bit) and a new type of LSA\n   (type-7)\
    \ area defined.  The \"N\" bit ensures that routers belonging to\n   an NSSA agree\
    \ on its configuration.  Similar to the stub area's use\n   of the \"E\" bit,\
    \ both NSSA neighbors must agree on the setting of the\n   \"N\" bit or the OSPF\
    \ neighbor adjacency will not form.\n   Type-7 LSAs provide for carrying external\
    \ route information within an\n   NSSA.  Type-7 AS External LSAs have virtually\
    \ the same syntax as the\n   Type-5 AS External LSAs with the obvious exception\
    \ of the link-state\n   type (see section 3.2 for more details). There are two\
    \ major semantic\n   differences between type-5 and type-7 LSAs.\n          o\
    \  Type-7 LSAs may be originated by and advertised\n             throughout an\
    \ NSSA; as with stub areas, NSSA's do not\n             receive or originate type-5\
    \ LSAs.\n          o  Type-7 LSAs are advertised only within a single NSSA;\n\
    \             they are not flooded into the backbone area or any\n           \
    \  other area by border routers, though the information\n             which they\
    \ contain can be propagated into the backbone\n             area (see section\
    \ 3.6).\n   In order to allow limited exchange of external information across\
    \ an\n   NSSA area border, NSSA border routers will translate selected type-7\n\
    \   LSAs received from the NSSA into type-5 LSAs.  These type-5 LSAs will\n  \
    \ be flooded to all type-5 capable areas.  NSSA area border routers may\n   be\
    \ configured with address ranges so that several type-7 LSAs may be\n   represented\
    \ by a single type-5 LSA.\n   In addition, an NSSA area border router can originate\
    \ a default\n   type-7 LSA (IP address of 0.0.0.0) into the NSSA.  Default routes\
    \ are\n   necessary because NSSAs do not receive full routing information and\n\
    \   must have a default route to route to AS-external destinations.  Like\n  \
    \ stub areas, NSSAs may be connected to the backbone at more than one\n   area\
    \ border router, but may not be used as a transit area.  Note that\n   the default\
    \ route originated by an NSSA area border router is never\n   translated into\
    \ a type-5 LSA, however, a default route originated by\n   an NSSA internal AS\
    \ boundary router (one that is not also an area\n   border router) may be translated\
    \ into a type-5 LSA.\n   It should also be noted that unlike stub areas, all OSPF\
    \ summary\n   routes (type-3 LSAs) must be imported into NSSAs.  This is to ensure\n\
    \   that OSPF internal routes are always chosen over OSPF external\n   (type-7)\
    \ routes.\n   In our example topology the subnets of 130.57 and network 192.31.114,\n\
    \   will still be learned by RIP on router BR18 but now both BR10 and\n   BR18\
    \ can be in an NSSA and all of BARRNets external routes are hidden\n   from BR18;\
    \ BR10 becomes an NSSA area border router and BR18 becomes\n   an AS boundary\
    \ router internal to the NSSA.  BR18 will import the\n   subnets of 130.57 and\
    \ network 192.31.114 as type-7 LSAs into the\n   NSSA.  BR10 then translates these\
    \ routes into type-5 LSAs and floods\n   them into BARRNet's backbone.\n"

- title: 3.1  The N-bit
  contents:
  - "3.1  The N-bit\n   The N-bit ensures that all members of a NSSA agree on the\
    \ area's\n   configuration.  Together, the N-bit and E-bit reflect an interface's\n\
    \   (and consequently the interface's associated area's) external LSA\n   flooding\
    \ capability.  As explained in section 10.5 of the OSPF\n   specification, if\
    \ type-5 LSAs are not flooded into/throughout the\n   area, the E-bit must be\
    \ clear in the option field of the received\n   Hello packets. Interfaces associated\
    \ with an NSSA will not send or\n   receive type-5 LSAs on that interface but\
    \ may send and receive type-7\n   LSAs.  Therefore, if the N-bit is set in the\
    \ options field, the E-bit\n   must be cleared.\n   To support the NSSA option\
    \ an additional check must be made in the\n   function that handles receiving\
    \ Hello packet to verify that both the\n   N-bit and the E-bit found in the Hello\
    \ packet's option field match\n   the value of the options that have been configured\
    \ in the receiving\n   interface.  A mismatch in the options causes processing\
    \ of the\n   received Hello packet to stop and the packet to be dropped.\n"
- title: 3.2  Type-7 Address Ranges
  contents:
  - "3.2  Type-7 Address Ranges\n   NSSA area border routers may be configured with\
    \ type-7 address\n   ranges.  Each address range is defined as an [address,mask]\
    \ pair.\n   Many separate type-7 networks may then be represented by in a single\n\
    \   address range (as advertised by a type-5 LSA), just as a subnetted\n   network\
    \ is composed of many separate subnets.  Area border routers\n   may then summarize\
    \ type-7 routes by advertising a single type-5 route\n   for each type-7 address\
    \ range.  The type-5 route, resulting from a\n   type-7 address range match will\
    \ be distributed to all type-5 capable\n   areas.  Section 4.1 gives the details\
    \ of generating type-5 routes\n   from type-7 address ranges.\n   A type-7 address\
    \ range includes the following configurable items.\n               o An [address,mask]\

- title: '3.3  Type-7 LSAs: NSSA External Link-State Advertisements'
  contents:
  - "3.3  Type-7 LSAs: NSSA External Link-State Advertisements\n   External routes\
    \ are imported into NSSAs as type-7 LSAs by the NSSA's\n   AS boundary routers.\
    \  An NSSA AS boundary routers is a router which\n   has an interface associated\
    \ with the NSSA and is exchanging routing\n   information with routers belonging\
    \ to another AS.  As with type-5\n   LSAs a separate type-7 LSA is originated\
    \ for each destination\n   network.  To support NSSA areas, the link-state database\
    \ must\n   therefore be expanded to contain a type-7 LSA.\n   Type 7-LSAs are\
    \ identical to type-5 LSAs except for the following\n   (see  section  12.3.4\
    \  \"AS external links\" in the OSPF\n   specification).\n      1. The type field\
    \ in the LSA header is 7.\n      2. Type-7 LSAs are only flooded within the NSSA.\n\
    \         The flooding of type-7 LSAs follow the same rules\n         as the flooding\
    \ of type 1-4 LSAs.\n      3. Type-7 LSAs are kept within the NSSA's LSDB (are\n\
    \         area specific) whereas because type-5 LSAs are\n         flooded to\
    \ all type-5 capable areas, type-5 LSAs\n         global scope in the router's\
    \ LSDB.\n      4. At the area border router, selected type-7 LSAs are\n      \
    \   translated into type 5-LSAs and flooded into the\n         backbone.\n   \
    \   5. Type 7 LSAs have a  propagate (P) bit which is\n         used to flag the\
    \ area border router to translate the\n         type-7 LSA into a type-5 LSA.\
    \ Examples of how the P-bit\n         is used for loop avoidance are in the following\
    \ sections.\n      6. Those type-7 LSAs that are to be translated into type-5\n\
    \         LSAs must have their forwarding address set.\n         Type-5 LSAs that\
    \ have been translated from type-7 LSAs\n         for the most part must contain\
    \ a forwarding address.\n         The execption to this is if the translation\
    \ to a type-5\n         LSA is the result of an address range match, in which\n\
    \         case the type-5 LSA will not contain a forwarding address\n        \
    \ (see section 4.1 for details).\n         The forwarding address contained in\
    \ type-5 LSAs will\n         result in more efficient routing to the AS external\n\
    \         networks when there are multiple NSSA area\n         border routers.\
    \ Having the forwarding address in the\n         type-7 LSAs will ease the translation\
    \ of type-7 into\n         type-5 LSAs as the NSSA area border router will\n \
    \        not be required to compute the forwarding address.\n         If the network\
    \ between the NSSA AS boundary router and the\n         adjacent AS is advertised\
    \ into OSPF as an internal OSPF\n         route, the forwarding address should\
    \ be the next hop\n         address as is currently done in type-5 LSAs, but unlike\n\
    \         type-5 LSAs if the intervening network is not advertised\n         into\
    \ OSPF as an internal OSPF route, the forwarding\n         address should be any\
    \ one of the router's active OSPF\n         interface addresses.\n   Type-5 and\
    \ type-7 metrics and path types are directly comparable.\n"
- title: 3.4  Originating Type-7 LSAs
  contents:
  - "3.4  Originating Type-7 LSAs\n   NSSA AS boundary routers may originate type-7\
    \ LSAs.  All NSSA area\n   border routers must also be AS boundary routers since\
    \ they all must\n   have the capability of translating a type-7 LSAs into a type-5\
    \ LSAs\n   (see section 3.6 routes for the translation algorithm).  NSSA area\n\
    \   border routers must set the E-bit (external bit) as well as the B-bit\n  \
    \ (border bit) in its router (type-1) LSAs (both in the backbone and in\n   the\
    \ NSSA area).\n   When an NSSA internal AS boundary router originates a type-7\
    \ LSA that\n   it wants to be translated into a type-5 LSA by the NSSA area border\n\
    \   router (and subsequently flooded into the backbone), it must set the\n   P-bit\
    \ in the LS header's option field and add a valid forwarding\n   address in the\
    \ type-7 LSA.\n   If a router is attached to another AS and is also an NSSA area\

    \   same network.  The type-5 LSA will be flooded to the backbone (and\n   all\
    \ attached type-5 capable areas) and the type-7 will be flooded\n   into the NSSA.\
    \  If this is the case, the P-bit must be reset in the\n   type-7 NSSA so the\
    \ type-7 LSA isn't again translated into a type-5\n   LSA by another NSSA area\
    \ border router.\n   A type-7 default route (network 0.0.0.0) may be originated\
    \ into the\n   NSSA by an NSSA area border router or by an NSSA AS boundary router\n\
    \   which is internal to the NSSA.  The type-7 default route originated\n   by\
    \ the NSSA area border router must have the P-bit reset so that the\n   default\
    \ route originated by the NSSA area border router will not find\n   its way out\

    \ router.  The type-7 default route originated by an\n   NSSA AS boundary router\

    \ must not be injected into the NSSA as a summary\n   (type-3) LSA as in the stub\
    \ area case.  The reason for this is that\n   the preferred summary default route\

- title: 3.5 Calculating Type-7 AS External Routes
  contents:
  - "3.5 Calculating Type-7 AS External Routes\n   This section is very similar to\
    \ section 16.4 (Calculating AS external\n   routes) in the OSPF specification.\
    \  An NSSA area border router should\n   examine both type-5 LSAs and type-7 LSAs\
    \ if either type-5 or type-7\n   routes need to be updated.  Type-7 LSAs should\
    \ be examined after\n   type-5 LSAs.  An NSSA internal router should examine type-7\
    \ LSAs when\n   type-7 routes need to be recalculated.\n   In relation to the\
    \ steps to calculate the routing table as presented\n   in the OSPF specification\
    \ (chapter 16, \"Calculation of the Routing\n   Table\"), type-7 LSAs should be\
    \ examined after step 5 where the routes\n   to external destinations are calculated.\n\
    \   Type-7 routes are calculated by examining type-7 LSAs.  Each of LSAs\n   are\
    \ considered in turn. Most type-7 LSAs describe routes to specific\n   IP destinations.\
    \  A type-7 LSA can also describe a default route for\n   the NSSA (destination\
    \ = DefaultDestination).  For each type-7 LSA:\n      1. If the metric specified\
    \ by the LSA is LSInfinity, the\n         age of the LSA equals MaxAge or the\
    \ advertising router\n         field is equal to this router's router ID, examine\
    \ the\n         next advertisement.\n      2. Call the destination described by\
    \ the LSA N. Look up the\n         routing table entry for the AS boundary router\
    \ (ASBR) that\n         originated the LSA. If no entry exists for the ASBR\n\
    \         (i.e., ASBR is unreachable), do nothing with this LSA and\n        \
    \ consider the next in the list.\n         If the destination is the default route\
    \ (destination =\n         DefaultDestination) and if the originator of the LSA\
    \ and\n         the calculating router are both NSSA area border routers\n   \
    \      do nothing with this LSA and consider the next in the list.\n         Else,\
    \ this LSA describes an AS external path to destination\n         N. If the forwarding\
    \ address (as specified in the forwarding\n         address field of the LSA)\
    \ is 0.0.0.0, the packets routed\n         to the external destination N will\
    \ be routed to the\n         originating ASBR. If the forwarding address is not\
    \ 0.0.0.0,\n         look up the forwarding address in the routing table. Packets\n\
    \         routed to the external destination N will be routed within\n       \
    \  the NSSA to this forwarding address. An intra-area path\n         must therefore\
    \ exist to the forwarding address. If no such\n         path exists, do nothing\
    \ with the LSA and consider the next\n         in the list.\n         Call the\
    \ routing table distance to the forwarding address\n         (or the distance\
    \ to the originating ASBR if the forwarding\n         address is 0.0.0.0) X, and\
    \ the cost specified in the type-7\n         LSA Y. X is in terms of the link-state\
    \ metric, and Y is a\n         Type-1 or Type-2 external metric.\n      3. Now,\
    \ look up the routing table entry for the destination\n         N. If no entries\
    \ exist for N, install the AS external path\n         to N, with the next hop\
    \ equal to the list of next hops to\n         the forwarding address/ASBR, and\
    \ the advertising router equal\n         to ASBR. If the external metric type\

    \ equal\n         to X + Y. If the external metric type is 2, the path-type\n\
    \         is set to Type-2 external, the link-state component of the\n       \
    \  route's cost is X, and the Type-2 cost is Y.\n      4. Else, if the paths present\

    \ external paths have\n         the lowest priority).\n      5. Otherwise, compare\
    \ the cost of this new AS external path\n         to the ones present in the table.\
    \ Note that type-5 and\n         type-7 routes are directly comparable. Type-1\
    \ external\n         paths are always shorter than Type-2 external paths.\n  \
    \       Type-1 external paths are compared by looking at the sum\n         of\
    \ the distance to the forwarding address/ASBR and the\n         advertised Type-1\
    \ paths (X+Y). Type-2 external paths are\n         compared by looking at the\
    \ advertised Type-2 metrics,\n         and then if necessary, the distance to\
    \ the forwarding\n         address/ASBR.\n         When a type-5 LSA and a type-7\
    \ LSA are found to have the\n         same type and an equal distance, the following\
    \ priorities\n         apply (listed from highest to lowest) for breaking the\
    \ tie.\n                 a. Any type 5 LSA.\n                 b. A type-7 LSA\
    \ with the P-bit set and the forwarding\n                    address non-zero.\n\
    \                 c. Any other type-7 LSA.\n         If the new path is shorter,\
    \ it replaces the present paths\n         in the routing table entry. If the new\
    \ path is the same\n         cost, it is added to the routing table entry's list\

  contents:
  - "4.1 Translating Type-7 LSAs Into Type-5 LSAs\n   This step is performed as part\
    \ of the NSSA's Dijkstra calculation\n   after type-5 and type-7 routes have been\
    \ calculated.  If the\n   calculating router is not an area border router this\
    \ translation\n   algorithm should be skipped.  All reachable area border routers\
    \ in\n   the NSSA should now be examined noting the one with the highest\n   router\
    \ ID.  If this router has the highest router ID, it will be the\n   one translating\
    \ type-7 LSAs into type-5 LSAs for the NSSA, otherwise\n   the translation algorithm\
    \ should not be performed.\n   All type-7 routes that have been added to the routing\
    \ table should be\n   examined.  If the type-7 LSA (associated with the route\
    \ being\n   examined) has the P-bit set and a non-zero forwarding address, the\n\
    \   following steps should be taken.\n      The translation procedure must first\
    \ check for a configured type-7\n      address range.  Recall that an type-7 address\
    \ range consists of an\n      [address,mask] pair and a status indication of either\
    \ Advertise or\n      DoNotAdvertise.  At most a single type-5 LSA is made for\
    \ each\n      range.  If the route being examined falls within the type-7\n  \
    \    address range, (the [address,mask] pair of the route equal to or a\n    \
    \  more specific instance of the [address,mask] pair of the type-7\n      address\
    \ range), one of following three actions may take place.\n         1. When the\
    \ range's status indicates Advertise and the\n            route's address and\
    \ mask are equal to the address\n            and mask of the type-7 range a type-5\
    \ LSA should be\n            originated if:\n            o there currently is\
    \ no type-5 LSA originated from\n              this router corresponding to the\
    \ type-7 LSA,\n            o the path type or the metric in the corresponding\n\
    \              type-5 LSA is different from the type-7 LSA or\n            o The\
    \ forwarding address in the corresponding\n              type-5 LSA is different\
    \ from the type-7 LSA.\n              The newly originated type-5 LSA will describe\n\
    \              the same network and have the same network mask,\n            \
    \  metrics, forwarding address, external route tag\n              and path type\
    \ as the type-7 LSA, however, the\n              advertising router field will\
    \ be the router ID\n              of this area border router.\n         2. When\
    \ the range's status indicates Advertise and the\n            route's address\
    \ or mask indicates a more specific\n            route (i.e., the route's address\
    \ is subsumed by the\n            range or the route has a longer mask), a type-5\
    \ LSA\n            is generated with link-state ID equal to the range's\n    \
    \        address (if necessary, the link-state ID can also have\n            one\
    \ or more of the range's \"host\" bits set; see\n            Appendix F of the\
    \ OSPF specification for details),\n            the network mask, external route\
    \ tag and\n            path type will be set to the configured type-7 range\n\
    \            values. The advertising router field will be the\n            router\
    \ ID of this area border router.\n            The forwarding address will not\
    \ be set.\n            The path type should always be set to the highest\n   \
    \         path type that is subsumed by the net range.\n            The metric\
    \ for the type-5 LSA will be set as follows:\n            o if the path type is\
    \ externl type 2, the type-5\n              metric should be set to the largest\
    \ type-7 metric\n              subsumed by this net range + 1.\n            o\
    \ if the path type is external type 1, the type-5\n              metric should\
    \ be set to the largest metric.\n            For example, given a net range of\
    \ [10.0.0.0, 255.0.0.0]\n            for an area that has type-7 routes of:\n\
    \                    10.1.0.0 path type 1, metric 10\n                    10.2.0.0\
    \ path type 1, metric 11\n                    10.3.0.0 path type 2, metric 5\n\
    \             a type-5 LSA will be generated with a path type of 2\n         \
    \    and a metric of 6.\n             As another example, given a net range of\n\
    \             [10.0.0.0, 255.0.0.0] for an area that has\n             type-7\
    \ routes of:\n                    10.1.0.0 path type 1, metric 10\n          \
    \          10.2.0.0 path type 1, metric 11\n                    10.3.0.0 path\
    \ type 1, metric 5\n             a type-5 LSA will be generated with a path type\
    \ of 1\n             and a metric of 11.\n             These metric and path type\
    \ rules will avoid routing\n             loops in the event that path type 1 and\
    \ 2 are both\n             used within the area.\n         3. When the range's\
    \ status indicates DoNotAdvertise,\n            the type-5 LSA is suppressed and\
    \ the component networks\n            remain hidden from the rest of the AS.\n\
    \            By default (given that the P-bit is set and the LSA has a\n     \
    \       non-zero forwarding address) if a network is not contained\n         \
    \   in any explicitly configured address range, a type-7 to\n            type-5\
    \ LSA translation will occur.\n            A new instance of a type-5 LSA should\
    \ be originated and\n            flooded to all attached type-5 capable areas\
    \ if one of the\n            following is true.\n            1. There currently\
    \ is no type-5 LSA originated from this\n               router corresponding to\
    \ the type-7 LSA.\n            2. The path type or the metric in the corresponding\n\
    \               type-5 LSA is different from the type-7 LSA.\n            3. The\
    \ forwarding address in the corresponding\n               type-5 LSA is different\
    \ from the type-7 LSA.\n            The newly originated type-5 LSAs will describe\
    \ the same\n            network and have the same network mask, metrics, forwarding\n\
    \            address, external route tag and path type as the type-7 LSA.\n  \
    \          The advertising router field will be the router ID of this\n      \
    \      area border router.\n            As with all newly originated type-5 LSAs,\
    \ a type-5 LSA that\n            is the result of a type-7 to type-5 translation\
    \ (type-7 range\n            or default case) is flooded to all attached type-5\
    \ capable\n            areas.\n"
