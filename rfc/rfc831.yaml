  - "1. Introduction\n  During  several  previous  SATNET  meetings,  it  has   been\n\
    \  observed  that  it  would  be  useful  for BBN to be able to\n  access the\
    \ European side of SATNET indirectly  via  the  VAN\n  Gateway,  when  direct\
    \  SATNET  connectivity  has been lost.\n  This short  paper  proposes  a  possible\
    \  approach  to  such\n  \"backup\" access, using the source routing option of\
    \ IP.\n  Figure 1 illustrates the problem we wish to solve.   The  US\n  host\
    \  H  is  used  for  diagnosis  and control of the SATNET\n  SIMP's S1 and S2\
    \ as well as the gateways B and G and the UCL\n  TAC (not shown, but connected\
    \ to G).\n                             SATNET\n                           (partitioned)\n\

    \                                         December 1982\n  VANgw is the VAN Gateway\
    \ which encapsulates IP datagrams  in\n  X25  packets for transmission over VAN/PTT\
    \ virtual circuits.\n  The collection of these paths, called \"IP tunnels\"  by\
    \  UCL,\n  is  addressed  from  the  Internet  as  a  distinct network,\n  VANNET.\n\
    \  U is a UCL host,  the  Terminal  Protocol  Converter,  which\n  provides a\
    \ path to UK X25 networks. However, to the Internet\n  world U looks like a host\
    \ on VANNET, so the path from  U  to\n  UCLNET (shown dotted) does not appear\
    \ to exist.\n  Now suppose SATNET is partitioned between S1 and  S2.   Then\n\
    \  we  wish  host H to be able to exchange IP datagrams with S2\n  via the \"\
    back door\" path:\n    H - Internet - VANgw - VANNET - U - UCLNET - G - S2\n \
    \ There are some important rules in this game, however.\n   (1)    U may only\
    \ be a host, not a gateway.\n          This is because we do not want the Internet\
    \ to route\n          ALL  its  traffic (e.g. rsre traffic and UCL traffic\n \
    \         that is required to use SATNET) via the  IP  Tunnel.\n          So \
    \ the VAN Gateway (VANgw) must not discover it can\n          get to UCLNET through\
    \ U.\n   (2)    To implement the  back  door  path  to  S2,  we  are\n       \
    \   willing  to have some special code in H and/or in U,\n          but not in\
    \ G, S2, or VANgw.\n          Note:  Jack  Haverty  is  allowed  to  violate \
    \ this\n          assumption,  though  we  doubt that he will want to.\n     \
    \     But we must stick to it.\n  Given these constraints, we claim  that  the\
    \  only  possible\n  solution  is  to  \"mung\" the headers of IP datagrams at\
    \ UCL.\n  Thus, when SATNET is partitioned:\n   (1)    The IP addresses of S2,\
    \  G,  and  the  UCL  TAC  are\n          unreachable  from  all US gateways.\
    \  Therefore, if H\n          sends  a  packet   addressed   to   one   of   these\n\
    \          destinations,  it  will  be  discarded  and  an ICMP\n          unreachable\
    \ message returned.\n                                                    December\
    \ 1982\n   (2)    Similarly, the IP address of H is  unreachable  from\n     \
    \     the  UK  side.   Hence, if the XNET debugger in a UK\n          host emits\
    \ a return  packet  addressed  to  H,  that\n          packet will be dropped.\n\
    \  Therefore, the destination address of  each  packet  from  H\n  must be changed\
    \ in order to reach the UCL side of SATNET (S2\n  or G), and the source address\
    \ of each of these packets  must\n  be  changed  so  that  return packets can\
    \ reach H.  For this\n  purpose, we introduce the Munger host M  (see Figure 2).\n\

    \                             December 1982\n  Suppose for example that host H\

    \ 1982\n  Suppose for example that host H desires to  reach  the  XNET\n  debugger\
    \  in  the  SIMP  S2.   H  must send its packets with\n  destination address M1;\
    \ these will be routed to M1 via VANgw\n  and  the IP Tunnel.  Host M will change\
    \ the headers of these\n  datagrams to contain source address M1 and  destination\
    \  S2.\n  S2  will  return packets to M1, and M1 will change them back\n  to M2->H\
    \ packets and launch them back through the VANNET  to\n  H.\n  How does M know\
    \ how to change the headers?\n   (1)    M could respond to a range of M1 and \
    \ M2  addresses,\n          and have a fixed table of correspondence.\n   (2)\
    \    We propose instead to use the SOURCE ROUTING  option\n          in  the \
    \ datagrams.   This assumes that H is able to\n          build source-routed datagrams,\
    \ and is not upset that\n          the intermediate host in the route is not a\
    \ gateway.\n          If we further assume that the IP layers in G and  S2\n \
    \         can  handle  source and return routes, then the task\n          is \
    \ simple.  M  must  contain  the  source   routing\n          algorithm  of  a\
    \  gateway,  but otherwise act as two\n          hosts (no routing updates, etc).\n\
    \   (3)    Although G supports source routing, S2 and  the  TAC\n          may\
    \  not.   In that case, S2 and the TAC will not be\n          able to recognise\
    \ the return  route  in  a  received\n          packet  and use it as a source\
    \ route in packets sent\n          in reply.\n          This possibility calls\
    \ for additional complexity  in\n          M, a combination of (1) and (2):\n\
    \           *      In  the  US  ->  UK  direction,  the  Source\n            \
    \      Routing option would be used.\n           *      In  the   reverse  direction\
    \  (UK  ->   US),\n                  mapping   of  datagram  addresses  would\
    \  be\n                  controlled by a table in M.\n                       \
    \                             December 1982\n          We suggest that M use source\
    \ routing to get  packets\n          from  H  to  S2,  and meanwhile build a \"\
    soft state\"\n          table showing this mapping.   When  a  packet  comes\n\
    \          from S2 without source routing, M would consult this\n          soft\
    \ state  table  to  discover  how  to  alter  the\n          addresses to reach\
    \ H again.  This would  allow  only\n          one US host at a time to access\
    \ a given SATNET host,\n          but surely this is no restriction.\n  In practice,\
    \ M2 and U should have different IP  tunnels  and\n  hence  different  DTE  addresses.\
    \  Since the caller pays the\n  X25 charges, the IP Tunnel for U  will  normally\
    \  be  opened\n  only  by UCL. On the other hand, the IP Tunnel to M2 will be\n\
    \  opened from the US end.  Since UCL has only  one  PSS  line,\n  this requires\
    \ the use of separate X25 subaddresses.  The VAN\n  gateway must handle 14 digit\
    \ X121 addresses, as well  as  12\n  digit addresses.\n"
