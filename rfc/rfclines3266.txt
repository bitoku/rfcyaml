Abstract This document describes the use of Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) addresses in conjunction with the Session Description Protocol (SDP).
Specifically, this document clarifies existing text in SDP with regards to the syntax of IPv6 addresses.
Introduction SDP is intended for describing multimedia sessions for the purposes of session announcement, session invitation, and other forms of multimedia session initiation.
It is a text format description that provides many details of a multimedia session including: the originator of the session, a URL related to the session, the connection address for the session media(s), and optional attributes for the session
Each of these pieces of information may involve one or more IPv6 addresses.
The ABNF for IP addresses in SDP currently leaves the syntax for IPv6 addresses undefined.
This document attempts to complete the ABNF to include IPv6 addresses.
Accordingly, the address type "IP6" indicating an IPv6 address, should be allowed in the connection field, "c ", of the SDP.
The ABNF already reflects this, though the "Connection Data" text under section 6 of RFC 2328 currently only defines the "IP4" address type.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [5].
[1] gives an ABNF for the text representation of IPv6 addresses in Appendix B.  RFC 2732 [3] covers the text representation of IPv6 addresses when used within a URL.
Using the ABNF described in these documents, the following updated ABNF for SDP is proposed.
It is a direct copy.
Example SDP description with IPv6 addresses
The following is an example SDP description using the above ABNF for IPv6 addresses.
In particular, the origin and connection fields contain IPv6 addresses.

An implementation may receive an SDP session description with an IPv6 address whose format [1] is internally that of an IPv4 mapped address.
Note that such an address is actually the address of an IPv4 only node, and implementors are warned to interpret IPv4 mapped addresses as equivalent to IP4.
This document updates the definition of the IP6 addrtype parameter found in RFC 2327.
No additional considerations above what is stated in section 7 of RFC 2327.
