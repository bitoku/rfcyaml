  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC2845] specifies a TSIG Resource Record (RR) that can\
    \ be used to\n   authenticate DNS (Domain Name System [STD13]) queries and responses.\n\
    \   This RR contains a domain name syntax data item that names the\n   authentication\
    \ algorithm used.  [RFC2845] defines the\n   HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT name for\
    \ authentication codes using the HMAC\n   (Hashed Message Authentication Code)\
    \ [RFC2104] algorithm with the MD5\n   (Message Digest 5) [RFC1321] hash algorithm.\
    \  IANA has also\n   registered \"gss-tsig\" as an identifier for TSIG authentication\
    \ where\n   the cryptographic operations are delegated to the Generic Security\n\
    \   Service (GSS) [RFC3645].\n   Note that use of TSIG presumes prior agreement,\
    \ between the resolver\n   and server involved, as to the algorithm and key to\
    \ be used.\n   In Section 2, this document specifies additional names for TSIG\n\
    \   authentication algorithms based on US NIST SHA (United States,\n   National\
    \ Institute of Science and Technology, Secure Hash Algorithm)\n   algorithms and\
    \ HMAC and specifies the implementation requirements for\n   those algorithms.\n\
    \   In Section 3, this document specifies the effect of inequality\n   between\
    \ the normal output size of the specified hash function and the\n   length of\
    \ MAC (Message Authentication Code) data given in the TSIG\n   RR.  In particular,\
    \ it specifies that a shorter-length field value\n   specifies truncation and\
    \ that a longer-length field is an error.\n   In Section 4, policy restrictions\
    \ and implications related to\n   truncation are described and specified, as is\
    \ a new error code to\n   indicate truncation shorter than that permitted by policy.\n\
    \   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"MAY\"\
    , in\n   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Algorithms and Identifiers
  contents:
  - "2.  Algorithms and Identifiers\n   TSIG Resource Records (RRs) [RFC2845] are\
    \ used to authenticate DNS\n   queries and responses.  They are intended to be\
    \ efficient symmetric\n   authentication codes based on a shared secret.  (Asymmetric\n\
    \   signatures can be provided using the SIG RR [RFC2931].  In\n   particular,\
    \ SIG(0) can be used for transaction signatures.)  Used\n   with a strong hash\
    \ function, HMAC [RFC2104] provides a way to\n   calculate such symmetric authentication\
    \ codes.  The only specified\n   HMAC-based TSIG algorithm identifier has been\
    \ HMAC-MD5.SIG-\n   ALG.REG.INT, based on MD5 [RFC1321].\n   The use of SHA-1\
    \ [FIPS180-2, RFC3174], which is a 160-bit hash, as\n   compared with the 128\
    \ bits for MD5, and additional hash algorithms in\n   the SHA family [FIPS180-2,\
    \ RFC3874, RFC4634] with 224, 256, 384, and\n   512 bits may be preferred in some\
    \ cases.  This is because\n   increasingly successful cryptanalytic attacks are\
    \ being made on the\n   shorter hashes.\n   Use of TSIG between a DNS resolver\
    \ and server is by mutual agreement.\n   That agreement can include the support\
    \ of additional algorithms and\n   criteria as to which algorithms and truncations\
    \ are acceptable,\n   subject to the restriction and guidelines in Sections 3\
    \ and 4 below.\n   Key agreement can be by the TKEY mechanism [RFC2930] or some\
    \ other\n   mutually agreeable method.\n   The current HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT\
    \ and gss-tsig identifiers are\n   included in the table below for convenience.\
    \  Implementations that\n   support TSIG MUST also implement HMAC SHA1 and HMAC\
    \ SHA256 and MAY\n   implement gss-tsig and the other algorithms listed below.\n\
    \      Mandatory      HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT\n      Optional       gss-tsig\n\
    \      Mandatory      hmac-sha1\n      Optional       hmac-sha224\n      Mandatory\
    \      hmac-sha256\n      Optional       hamc-sha384\n      Optional       hmac-sha512\n\
    \   SHA-1 truncated to 96 bits (12 octets) SHOULD be implemented.\n"
- title: 3.  Specifying Truncation
  contents:
  - "3.  Specifying Truncation\n   When space is at a premium and the strength of\
    \ the full length of an\n   HMAC is not needed, it is reasonable to truncate the\
    \ HMAC output and\n   use the truncated value for authentication.  HMAC SHA-1\
    \ truncated to\n   96 bits is an option available in several IETF protocols, including\n\
    \   IPsec and TLS.\n   The TSIG RR [RFC2845] includes a \"MAC size\" field, which\
    \ gives the\n   size of the MAC field in octets.  However, [RFC2845] does not\
    \ specify\n   what to do if this MAC size differs from the length of the output\
    \ of\n   HMAC for a particular hash function.  Truncation is indicated by a\n\
    \   MAC size less than the HMAC size, as specified below.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Truncation Specification
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Truncation Specification\n   The specification for TSIG handling is changed\
    \ as follows:\n   1. If \"MAC size\" field is greater than HMAC output length:\n\
    \         This case MUST NOT be generated and, if received, MUST cause\n     \
    \ the packet to be dropped and RCODE 1 (FORMERR) to be returned.\n   2. If \"\
    MAC size\" field equals HMAC output length:\n         Operation is as described\
    \ in [RFC2845], and the entire output\n      HMAC output is present.\n   3. \"\
    MAC size\" field is less than HMAC output length but greater than\n      that\
    \ specified in case 4, below:\n         This is sent when the signer has truncated\
    \ the HMAC output to\n      an allowable length, as described in RFC 2104, taking\
    \ initial\n      octets and discarding trailing octets.  TSIG truncation can only\n\
    \      be to an integral number of octets.  On receipt of a packet with\n    \
    \  truncation thus indicated, the locally calculated MAC is similarly\n      truncated\
    \ and only the truncated values are compared for\n      authentication.  The request\
    \ MAC used when calculating the TSIG\n      MAC for a reply is the truncated request\
    \ MAC.\n   4. \"MAC size\" field is less than the larger of 10 (octets) and half\n\
    \      the length of the hash function in use:\n         With the exception of\
    \ certain TSIG error messages described in\n      RFC 2845, Section 3.2, where\
    \ it is permitted that the MAC size be\n      zero, this case MUST NOT be generated\
    \ and, if received, MUST cause\n      the packet to be dropped and RCODE 1 (FORMERR)\
    \ to be returned.\n      The size limit for this case can also, for the hash functions\n\
    \      mentioned in this document, be stated as less than half the hash\n    \
    \  function length for hash functions other than MD5 and less than 10\n      octets\
    \ for MD5.\n"
- title: 4.  TSIG Truncation Policy and Error Provisions
  contents:
  - "4.  TSIG Truncation Policy and Error Provisions\n   Use of TSIG is by mutual\
    \ agreement between a resolver and server.\n   Implicit in such \"agreement\"\
    \ are criterion as to acceptable keys and\n   algorithms and, with the extensions\
    \ in this document, truncations.\n   Note that it is common for implementations\
    \ to bind the TSIG secret\n   key or keys that may be in place at a resolver and\
    \ server to\n   particular algorithms.  Thus, such implementations only permit\
    \ the\n   use of an algorithm if there is an associated key in place.  Receipt\n\
    \   of an unknown, unimplemented, or disabled algorithm typically results\n  \
    \ in a BADKEY error.\n      Local policies MAY require the rejection of TSIGs,\
    \ even though\n   they use an algorithm for which implementation is mandatory.\n\
    \      When a local policy permits acceptance of a TSIG with a particular\n  \
    \ algorithm and a particular non-zero amount of truncation, it SHOULD\n   also\
    \ permit the use of that algorithm with lesser truncation (a\n   longer MAC) up\
    \ to the full HMAC output.\n      Regardless of a lower acceptable truncated MAC\
    \ length specified by\n   local policy, a reply SHOULD be sent with a MAC at least\
    \ as long as\n   that in the corresponding request, unless the request specified\
    \ a MAC\n   length longer than the HMAC output.\n      Implementations permitting\
    \ multiple acceptable algorithms and/or\n   truncations SHOULD permit this list\
    \ to be ordered by presumed\n   strength and SHOULD allow different truncations\
    \ for the same\n   algorithm to be treated as separate entities in this list.\
    \  When so\n   implemented, policies SHOULD accept a presumed stronger algorithm\
    \ and\n   truncation than the minimum strength required by the policy.\n     \
    \ If a TSIG is received with truncation that is permitted under\n   Section 3\
    \ above but the MAC is too short for the local policy in\n   force, an RCODE of\
    \ 22 (BADTRUNC) MUST be returned.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   This document (1) registers the new TSIG algorithm\
    \ identifiers listed\n   in Section 2 with IANA and (2) allocates the BADTRUNC\
    \ RCODE 22 in\n   Section 4 [RFC2845].\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   For all of the message authentication code algorithms\
    \ listed herein,\n   those producing longer values are believed to be stronger;\
    \ however,\n   while there have been some arguments that mild truncation can\n\
    \   strengthen a MAC by reducing the information available to an\n   attacker,\
    \ excessive truncation clearly weakens authentication by\n   reducing the number\
    \ of bits an attacker has to try to break the\n   authentication by brute force\
    \ [RFC2104].\n   Significant progress has been made recently in cryptanalysis\
    \ of hash\n   function of the types used herein, all of which ultimately derive\n\
    \   from the design of MD4.  While the results so far should not effect\n   HMAC,\
    \ the stronger SHA-1 and SHA-256 algorithms are being made\n   mandatory due to\
    \ caution.\n   See the Security Considerations section of [RFC2845].  See also\
    \ the\n   Security Considerations section of [RFC2104] from which the limits on\n\
    \   truncation in this RFC were taken.\n"
