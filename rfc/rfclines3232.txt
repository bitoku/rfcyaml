Abstract This memo obsoletes RFC 1700
(STD 2) "Assigned Numbers", which contained an October 1994 snapshot of assigned Internet protocol parameters.
Description From November 1977 through October 1994, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) periodically published tables of the Internet protocol parameter assignments in RFCs entitled, "Assigned Numbers".
The most current of these Assigned Numbers RFCs had Standard status and carried the designation:
At this time, the latest STD 2 is RFC 1700.
Since 1994, this sequence of RFCs have been replaced by an online database accessible through a web page (currently, www.iana.org).
The purpose of the present RFC is to note this fact and to officially obsolete RFC 1700, whose status changes to Historic.
RFC 1700 is obsolete, and its values are incomplete and in some cases may be wrong.
We expect this series to be revived in the future by the new IANA organization.
This memo does not affect the technical security of the Internet.
