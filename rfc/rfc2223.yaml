    \   This Request for Comments (RFC) provides information about the\n   preparation\
    \ of RFCs, and certain policies relating to the publication\n   of RFCs.\n   The\
    \ RFC series of notes covers a broad range of interests.  The core\n   topics\
    \ are the Internet and the TCP/IP protocol suite.  However, any\n   topic related\
    \ to computer communication may be acceptable at the\n   discretion of the RFC\
    \ Editor.\n   Memos proposed to be RFCs may be submitted by anyone.  One large\n\
    \   source of memos that become RFCs is the Internet Engineering Task\n   Force\
    \ (IETF).  The IETF working groups (WGs) evolve their working\n   memos (known\
    \ as Internet Drafts or I-Ds) until they feel they are\n   ready for publication,\
    \ then the memos are reviewed by the Internet\n   Engineering Steering Group (IESG),\
    \ and if approved sent by the IESG\n   to the RFC Editor.\n   Most of the memos\
    \ submitted to the RFC Editor from independent\n   sources will be reviewed by\
    \ the IESG for possible relationship to\n   work in progress in the IETF Working\
    \ Groups.\n   RFCs are distributed online by being stored as public access files,\n\
    \   and a short message is sent to the distribution list indicating the\n   availability\
    \ of the memo.\n   The online files are copied by the interested people and printed\
    \ or\n   displayed at their site on their equipment.  This means that the\n  \
    \ format of the online files must meet the constraints of a wide\n   variety of\
    \ printing and display equipment.  (RFCs may also be\n   returned via e-mail in\
    \ response to an e-mail query, or RFCs may be\n   found using information and\
    \ database searching tools such as Gopher,\n   Wais, or the World Wide Web (WWW).\n\
    \   RFCs have been traditionally published and continue to be published\n   in\
    \ ASCII text.\n   While the primary RFCs is always an ASCII text file, secondary\
    \ or\n   alternative versions of RFC may be provided in PostScript.  This\n  \
    \ decision is motivated by the desire to include diagrams, drawings,\n   and such\
    \ in RFCs.  PostScript documents (on paper only, so far) are\n   visually more\
    \ appealing and have better readability.\n   PostScript was chosen for the fancy\
    \ form of RFC publication over\n   other possible systems (e.g., impress, interpress,\
    \ oda) because of\n   the perceived wide spread availability of PostScript capable\n\
    \   printers.\n   However, many RFC users read the documents online and use various\n\
    \   text oriented tools (e.g., emacs, grep) to search them.  Often, brief\n  \
    \ excerpts from RFCs are included in e-mail.  These practices are not\n   yet\
    \ practical with PostScript files.\n   PostScript producing systems are less standard\
    \ than is desirable and\n   that several of the document production systems that\
    \ claim to produce\n   PostScript actually produce nonstandard results.\n   In\
    \ the future, it may be necessary to identify a set of document\n   production\
    \ systems authorized for use in production of PostScript\n   RFCs, based on the\
    \ reasonableness of the output files they generate.\n2.  Editorial Policy\n  \
    \ Documents proposed to be RFCs are reviewed by the RFC Editor and\n   possibly\
    \ by other reviewers he selects.\n   The result of the review may be to suggest\
    \ to the author some\n   improvements to the document before publication.\n  \
    \ Occasionally, it may be apparent that the topic of a proposed RFC is\n   also\
    \ the subject of an IETF Working Group, and that the author could\n   coordinate\
    \ with the working group to the advantage of both.  The\n   usual result of this\
    \ is that a revised memo is produced as a working\n   group Internet Draft and\
    \ eventually emerges from the IETF process as\n   a recommendation from the IESG\
    \ to the RFC Editor.\n   In some cases it may be determined that the submitted\
    \ document is not\n   appropriate material to be published as an RFC.\n   In some\
    \ cases it may be necessary to include in the document a\n   statement based on\
    \ the reviews about the ideas in the document.  This\n   may be done in the case\
    \ that the document suggests relevant but\n   inappropriate or unsafe ideas, and\
    \ other situations.\n   The RFC Editor may make minor changes to the document,\
    \ especially in\n   the areas of style and format, but on some occasions also\
    \ to the\n   text.  Sometimes the RFC Editor will undertake to make more\n   significant\
    \ changes, especially when the format rules (see below) are\n   not followed.\
    \  However, more often the memo will be returned to the\n   author for the additional\
    \ work.\n   Documents intended to become RFCs specifying standards track\n   protocols\
    \ must be approved by the IESG before being sent to the RFC\n   Editor.  The established\
    \ procedure is that when the IESG completes\n   work on a document that is to\
    \ become a standards track RFC the\n   communication will be from the Secretary\
    \ of the IESG to the RFC\n   Editor.  Generally, the documents in question are\
    \ Internet Drafts.\n   The communication usually cites the exact Internet Draft\
    \ in question\n   (by file name).  The RFC Editor must assume that only that file\
    \ is to\n   be processed to become the RFC.  If the authors have small\n   corrections\
    \ to the text, they should be sent to the RFC Editor\n   separately (or as a \"\
    diff\"), authors should not send a new version of\n   the document.\n   In some\
    \ cases, authors prepare alternate secondary versions of RFCs\n   in fancy format\
    \ using PostScript.  Since the ASCII text version of\n   the RFC is the primary\
    \ version, the PostScript version must match the\n   text version.  The RFC Editor\
    \ must decide if the PostScript version\n   is \"the same as\" the ASCII version\
    \ before the PostScript version can\n   be published.\n   The effect of this is\
    \ that the RFC Editor first processes the ASCII\n   version of the memo through\
    \ to publication as an RFC.  If the author\n   wishes to submit a PostScript version\
    \ at that point that matches the\n   ASCII version (and the RFC Editor agrees\
    \ that it does), then the\n   PostScript version will be installed in the RFC\
    \ repositories and\n   announced to the community.\n   Due to various time pressures\
    \ on the RFC Editorial staff, the time\n   elapsed between submission and publication\
    \ can vary greatly.  It is\n   always acceptable to query (ping) the RFC Editor\
    \ about the status of\n   an RFC during this time (but not more than once a week).\
    \  The two\n   weeks preceding an IETF meeting are generally very busy, so RFCs\n\
    \   submitted shortly before an IETF meeting are most likely to be\n   published\
    \ after the meeting.\n3.  Format Rules\n   To meet the distribution constraints,\
    \ the following rules are\n   established for the two allowed formats for RFCs:\
    \  ASCII and\n   PostScript.\n   The RFC Editor attempts to ensure a consistent\
    \ RFC style.  To do this\n   the RFC Editor may choose to reformat the RFC submitted.\
    \  It is much\n   easier to do this if the submission matches the style of the\
    \ most\n   recent RFCs.  Please do look at some recent RFCs and prepare yours\
    \ in\n   the same style.\n   You must submit an editable online document to the\
    \ RFC Editor.  The\n   RFC Editor may require or make minor changes in format\
    \ or style and\n   will insert the actual RFC number.\n   Most of the RFCs are\
    \ processed by the RFC Editor with the unix\n   \"nroff\" program using a very\
    \ simple set of the formatting commands\n   (or \"requests\") from the \"ms\"\
    \ macro package (see the Appendix).  If a\n   memo submitted to be an RFC has\
    \ been prepared by the author using\n   nroff, it is very helpful to let the RFC\
    \ Editor know that when it is\n   submitted.\n   3a.  ASCII Format Rules\n   \
    \   The character codes are ASCII.\n      Each page must be limited to 58 lines\
    \ followed by a form feed on a\n      line by itself.\n      Each line must be\
    \ limited to 72 characters followed by carriage\n      return and line feed.\n\
    \      No overstriking (or underlining) is allowed.\n      These \"height\" and\
    \ \"width\" constraints include any headers,\n      footers, page numbers, or\
    \ left side indenting.\n      Do not fill the text with extra spaces to provide\
    \ a straight right\n      margin.\n      Do not do hyphenation of words at the\
    \ right margin.\n      Do not use footnotes.  If such notes are necessary, put\
    \ them at\n      the end of a section, or at the end of the document.\n      Use\
    \ single spaced text within a paragraph, and one blank line\n      between paragraphs.\n\
    \      Note that the number of pages in a document and the page numbers\n    \
    \  on which various sections fall will likely change with\n      reformatting.\
    \  Thus cross references in the text by section number\n      usually are easier\
    \ to keep consistent than cross references by\n      page number.\n      RFCs\
    \ in ASCII Format may be submitted to the RFC Editor in e-mail\n      messages\
    \ (or as online files) in either the finished publication\n      format or in\
    \ nroff.  If you plan to submit a document in nroff\n      please consult the\
    \ RFC Editor first.\n   3b.  PostScript Format Rules\n      Standard page size\
    \ is 8 1/2 by 11 inches.\n      Margin of 1 inch on all sides (top, bottom, left,\
    \ and right).\n      Main text should have a point size of no less than 10 points\
    \ with\n      a line spacing of 12 points.\n      Footnotes and graph notations\
    \ no smaller than 8 points with a line\n      spacing of 9.6 points.\n      Three\
    \ fonts are acceptable: Helvetica, Times Roman, and Courier.\n      Plus their\
    \ bold-face and italic versions.  These are the three\n      standard fonts on\
    \ most PostScript printers.\n      Prepare diagrams and images based on lowest\
    \ common denominator\n      PostScript.  Consider common PostScript printer functionality\
    \ and\n      memory requirements.\n      The following PostScript commands should\
    \ not be used:\n      initgraphics, erasepage, copypage, grestoreall, initmatrix,\n\
    \      initclip, banddevice, framedevice, nulldevice and renderbands.\n      Note\
    \ that the number of pages in a document and the page numbers\n      on which\
    \ various sections fall will likely differ in the ASCII and\n      the PostScript\
    \ versions.  Thus cross references in the text by\n      section number usually\
    \ are easier to keep consistent than cross\n      references by page number.\n\
    \      These PostScript rules are likely to changed and expanded as\n      experience\
    \ is gained.\n      RFCs in PostScript Format may be submitted to the RFC Editor\
    \ in\n      e-mail messages (or as online files).  If you plan to submit a\n \
    \     document in PostScript please consult the RFC Editor first.\n      Note\
    \ that since the ASCII text version of the RFC is the primary\n      version,\
    \ the PostScript version must match the text version.  The\n      RFC Editor must\
    \ decide if the PostScript version is \"the same as\"\n      the ASCII version\
    \ before the PostScript version can be published.\n4.  Headers and Footers\n \
    \  There is the first page heading, the running headers, and the running\n   footers.\n\
    \   4a.  First Page\n      Please see the front page of this memo for an example\
    \ of the front\n      page heading.  On the first page there is no running header.\
    \  The\n      top of the first page has the following items:\n      Network Working\
    \ Group\n         The traditional heading for the group that founded the RFC\n\
    \         series.  This appears on the first line on the left hand side\n    \
    \     of the heading.\n      Request for Comments: nnnn\n         Identifies this\
    \ as a request for comments and specifies the\n         number.  Indicated on\
    \ the second line on the left side.  The\n         actual number is filled in\
    \ at the last moment before\n         publication by the RFC Editor.\n      Author\n\
    \         The author's name (first initial and last name only) indicated\n   \
    \      on the first line on the right side of the heading.\n      Organization\n\
    \         The author's organization, indicated on the second line on the\n   \
    \      right side.\n      Date\n         This is the Month and Year of the RFC\
    \ Publication. Indicated on\n         the third line on the right side.\n    \
    \  Updates or Obsoletes\n         If this RFC Updates or Obsoletes another RFC,\
    \ this is indicated\n         as third line on the left side of the heading.\n\
    \      Category\n         The category of this RFC, one of: Standards Track, Best\
    \ Current\n         Practice, Informational, or Experimental.  This is indicated\
    \ on\n         the third (if there is no Updates or Obsoletes indication) or\n\
    \         fourth line of the left side.\n      Other Numbers\n         Other numbers\
    \ in the RFC series of notes include the subseries\n         of FYI (For Your\
    \ Information) [4], BCP (Best Current Practice)\n         [5], and STD (Standard)\
    \ [6].  These are placed on the left\n         side.\n      Title\n         The\
    \ title appears, centered, below the rest of the heading.\n         Periods or\
    \ \"dots\" in the titles are not allowed.\n      If there are multiple authors\
    \ and if the multiple authors are from\n      multiple organizations the right\
    \ side heading may have additional\n      lines to accommodate them and to associate\
    \ the authors with the\n      organizations properly.\n   4b.  Running Headers\n\
    \      The running header in one line (on page 2 and all subsequent\n      pages)\
    \ has the RFC number on the left (RFC NNNN), the (possibly\n      nshortened form)\
    \ title centered, and the date (Month Year) on the\n      right.\n   4c.  Running\
    \ Footers\n      The running footer in one line (on all pages) has the author's\n\
    \      last name on the left, category centered, and the page number on\n    \
    \  the right ([Page N]).\n5.  Status Section\n   Each RFC must include on its\
    \ first page the \"Status of this Memo\"\n   section which contains two elements:\
    \ (1) a paragraph describing the\n   type of the RFC, and (2) the distribution\
    \ statement.\n   The content of this section will be one of the four following\n\
    \   statements.\n   Standards Track\n      \"This document specifies an Internet\
    \ standards track protocol for\n      the Internet community, and requests discussion\
    \ and suggestions\n      for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition\
    \ of the\n      \"Internet Official Protocol Standards\" (STD 1) for the\n   \
    \   standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution\n      of\
    \ this memo is unlimited.\"\n   Best Current Practice\n      \"This document specifies\
    \ an Internet Best Current Practices for\n      the Internet Community, and requests\
    \ discussion and suggestions\n      for improvements.  Distribution of this memo\
    \ is unlimited.\"\n   Experimental\n      \"This memo defines an Experimental\
    \ Protocol for the Internet\n      community.  This memo does not specify an Internet\
    \ standard of any\n      kind.  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are\
    \ requested.\n      Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\"\n   Informational\n\
    \      \"This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This\n  \
    \    memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.\n      Distribution\
    \ of this memo is unlimited.\"\n6.  Copyright Notice\n   Immediately following\
    \ the Status section the statement, \"Copyright\n   (C) The Internet Society (date).\
    \  All Rights Reserved.\" is placed.\n   Also, see Section 11 for the full statement\
    \ that must appear at the\n   end of the document.\n7.  Introduction Section\n\
    \   Each RFC should have an Introduction section that (among other\n   things)\
    \ explains the motivation for the RFC and (if appropriate)\n   describes the applicability\
    \ of the protocol described.\n      Normally, this will be the \"abstract\" section\
    \ from the Internet\n      Draft.  If the RFC is not based on an I-D, other possibilities\n\
    \      are:\n         Protocol\n            This protocol is intended to provide\
    \ the bla-bla service,\n            and be used between clients and servers on\
    \ host computers.\n            Typically the clients are on workstation hosts\
    \ and the\n            servers on mainframe hosts.\n            or\n         \
    \   This protocol is intended to provide the bla-bla service,\n            and\
    \ be used between special purpose units such as terminal\n            servers\
    \ or routers and a monitoring host.\n         Discussion\n            The purpose\
    \ of this RFC is to focus discussion on particular\n            problems in the\
    \ Internet and possible methods of solution.\n            No proposed solutions\
    \ in this document are intended as\n            standards for the Internet.  Rather,\
    \ it is hoped that a\n            general consensus will emerge as to the appropriate\
    \ solution\n            to such problems, leading eventually to the adoption of\n\
    \            standards.\n         Interest\n            This RFC is being distributed\
    \ to members of the Internet\n            community in order to solicit their\
    \ reactions to the\n            proposals contained in it.  While the issues discussed\
    \ may\n            not be directly relevant to the research problems of the\n\
    \            Internet, they may be interesting to a number of researchers\n  \
    \          and implementers.\n         Status Report\n            In response\
    \ to the need for maintenance of current\n            information about the status\
    \ and progress of various\n            projects in the Internet community, this\
    \ RFC is issued for\n            the benefit of community members.  The information\
    \ contained\n            in this document is accurate as of the date of publication,\n\
    \            but is subject to change.  Subsequent RFCs will reflect such\n  \
    \          changes.\n      These paragraphs need not be followed word for word,\
    \ but the\n      general intent of the RFC must be made clear.\n8.  References\
    \ Section\n   Nearly all RFCs contain citations to other documents, and these\
    \ are\n   listed in a References section near the end of the RFC.  There are\n\
    \   many styles for references, and the RFCs have one of their own.\n   Please\
    \ follow the reference style used in recent RFCs.  See the\n   reference section\
    \ of this RFC for an example.  Please note that for\n   protocols that have been\
    \ assigned STD numbers, the STD number must be\n   included in the reference.\n\
    \   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify\n   the\
    \ requirements in the specification.  These words are often\n   capitalized. \
    \ BCP 14, RFC 2119 [3], defines these words as they\n   should be interpreted\
    \ in IETF documents.\n9.  Security Considerations Section\n   All RFCs must contain\
    \ a section near the end of the document that\n   discusses the security considerations\
    \ of the protocol or procedures\n   that are the main topic of the RFC.\n10. \
    \ Author's Address Section\n   Each RFC must have at the very end a section giving\
    \ the author's\n   address, including the name and postal address, the telephone\

    \ on a topic discussed in a previous\n   RFC or completely replaces an earlier\
    \ RFC.  There are two terms used\n   for these cases respectively, Updates and\
    \ Obsoletes.  A document that\n   obsoletes an earlier document can stand on its\
    \ own.  A document that\n   merely updates an earlier document cannot stand on\
    \ its own; it is\n   something that must be added to or inserted into the previously\n\
    \   existing document, and has limited usefulness independently.  The\n   terms\
    \ Supercedes and Replaces are no longer used.\n   Updates\n      To be used as\
    \ a reference from a new item that cannot be used\n      alone (i.e., one that\
    \ supplements a previous document), to refer\n      to the previous document.\
    \  The newer publication is a part that\n      will supplement or be added on\
    \ to the existing document; e.g., an\n      addendum, or separate, extra information\
    \ that is to be added to\n      the original document.\n   Obsoletes\n      To\
    \ be used to refer to an earlier document that is replaced by\n      this document.\
    \  This document contains either revised information,\n      or else all of the\
    \ same information plus some new information,\n      however extensive or brief\
    \ that new information is; i.e., this\n      document can be used alone, without\
    \ reference to the older\n      document.\n      For example:\n         On the\
    \ Assigned Numbers RFCs the term Obsoletes should be used\n         since the\
    \ new document actually incorporate new information\n         (however brief)\
    \ into the text of existing information and is\n         more up-to-date than\
    \ the older document, and hence, replaces it\n         and makes it Obsoletes.\n\
    \   In lists of RFCs or the RFC-Index (but not on the RFCs themselves)\n   the\
    \ following may be used with early documents to point to later\n   documents.\n\
    \   Obsoleted-by\n      To be used to refer to the newer document(s) that replaces\
    \ the\n      older document.\n   Updated-by\n      To be used to refer to the\
    \ newer section(s) which are to be added\n      to the existing, still used, document.\n\
    13.  Protocol Standards Process\n   See the current \"Internet Official Protocol\
    \ Standards\" (STD 1) memo\n   for the definitive statement on protocol standards\
    \ and their\n   publication [1].\n   The established procedure is that when the\
    \ IESG completes work on a\n   document that is to become a standards track RFC\
    \ the communication\n   will be from the Secretary of the IESG to the RFC Editor.\
    \  Generally,\n   the documents in question are Internet Drafts.  The communication\n\
    \   usually cites the exact Internet Draft (by file name) in question.\n   The\
    \ RFC Editor must assume that only that file is to be processed to\n   become\
    \ the RFC.  If the authors have small corrections to the text,\n   they should\
    \ be sent to the RFC Editor separately (or as a \"diff\"), do\n   not send a new\
    \ version of the document.\n14.  Contact\n   To contact the RFC Editor send an\
    \ email message to:\n         \"rfc-editor@isi.edu\".\n15.  Distribution Lists\n\
    \   The RFC announcements are distributed via two mailing lists: the\n   \"IETF-Announce\"\
    \ list, and the \"RFC-DIST\" list.  You don't want to be\n   on both lists.\n\
    \   To join (or quit) the IETF-Announce list send a message to ietf-\n   request@ietf.org.\n\
    \   To join (or quit) the RFC-DIST list send a message to rfc-dist-\n   request@isi.edu.\n\
    16.  RFC Index\n   Several organizations maintain RFC Index files, generally using\
    \ the\n   file name \"rfc-index.txt\".  The contents of such a file copied from\n\
    \   one site may not be identical to that copied from another site.\n17.  Security\
    \ Considerations\n   This RFC raises no security issues (however, see Section\
    \ 9).\n18.  References\n   [1]  Postel, J., Editor, \"Internet Official Protocol\

    \ macros\"\n   Generally, we use the very simplest nroff features.  We use the\
    \ \"ms\"\n   macros.  So, \"nroff -ms input-file > output-file\".  However, we\
    \ could\n   not get nroff to do the right thing about putting a form feed after\n\
    \   the last visible line on a page and no extra line feeds before the\n   first\
    \ visible line of the next page.  We want:\n        last visible line on page\
    \ i\n        ^L\n        first visible line on page i+1\n   So, we invented a\
    \ hack to fix this.  We use a perl script called\n   \"fix.pl\".  So the command\
    \ to process the file becomes:\n        nroff -ms input-file | fix.pl > output-file\n\
    \   The actual perl script is:\n#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\
    #! /local/bin/perl\n# fix.pl  17-Nov-93  Craig Milo Rogers at USC/ISI\n#\n#  \
    \     The style guide for RFCs calls for pages to be delimited by the\n# sequence\
    \ <last-non-blank-line><formfeed-line><first-non-blank-line>.\n# Unfortunately,\
    \ NROFF is reluctant to produce output that conforms to\n# this convention.  This\
    \ script fixes RFC-style documents by searching\n# for the token \"FORMFEED[Page\"\
    , replacing \"FORMFEED\" with spaces,\n# appending a formfeed line, and deleting\
    \ white space up to the next\n# non-white space character.\n#\n#       There is\
    \ one difference between this script's output and that of\n# the \"fix.sh\" and\
    \ \"pg\" programs it replaces:  this script includes a\n# newline after the formfeed\
    \ after the last page in a file, whereas the\n# earlier programs left a bare formfeed\
    \ as the last character in the\n# file.  To obtain bare formfeeds, uncomment the\
    \ second substitution\n# command below.  To strip the final formfeed, uncomment\
    \ the third\n# substitution command below.\n#\n#       This script is intended\
    \ to run as a filter, as in:\n#\n# nroff -ms input-file | fix.pl > output-file\n\
    #\n#       When porting this script, please observe the following points:\n#\n\
    # 1)    ISI keeps perl in \"/local/bin/perl\";  your system may keep it\n#   \
    \    elsewhere.\n# 2)    On systems with a CRLF end-of-line convention, the \"\
    \\n\"s below\n#       may have to be replaced with \"\\r\\n\"s.\n$* = 1;     \

    A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers\n.ti 0\nStatus\
    \ of this Memo\n.fi\n.in 3\nThis memo describes an experimental method for the\
    \ encapsulation of IP\ndatagrams in avian carriers.  This specification is primarily\
    \ useful\nin Metropolitan Area Networks.  This is an experimental, not recommended\n\
    standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n.ti 0\nOverview and Rational\n\
    Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low\naltitude service.\
    \  The connection topology is limited to a single\npoint-to-point path for each\
    \ carrier, used with standard carriers, but\nmany carriers can be used without\
    \ significant interference with each\nother, outside of early spring.  This is\
    \ because of the 3D ether space\navailable to the carriers, in contrast to the\
    \ 1D ether used by\nIEEE802.3.  The carriers have an intrinsic collision avoidance\
    \ system,\nwhich increases availability.  Unlike some network technologies, such\n\
    as packet radio, communication is not limited to line-of-sight\ndistance.  Connection\
    \ oriented service is available in some cities,\nusually based upon a central\
    \ hub topology.\n.ti 0\nFrame Format\nThe IP datagram is printed, on a small scroll\
    \ of paper, in\nhexadecimal, with each octet separated by whitestuff and blackstuff.\n\
    The scroll of paper is wrapped around one leg of the avian carrier.\nA band of\
    \ duct tape is used to secure the datagram's edges.  The\nbandwidth is limited\
    \ to the leg length.  The MTU is variable, and\nparadoxically, generally increases\
    \ with increased carrier age.  A\ntypical MTU is 256 milligrams.  Some datagram\
    \ padding may be needed.\nUpon receipt, the duct tape is removed and the paper\
    \ copy of the\ndatagram is optically scanned into a electronically transmittable\n\
    form.\n.ti 0\nDiscussion\nMultiple types of service can be provided with a prioritized\
    \ pecking\norder.  An additional property is built-in worm detection and\neradication.\
    \  Because IP only guarantees best effort delivery, loss of\na carrier can be\
    \ tolerated.  With time, the carriers are\nself-regenerating.  While broadcasting\
    \ is not specified, storms can\ncause data loss.  There is persistent delivery\
    \ retry, until the\ncarrier drops.  Audit trails are automatically generated,\
    \ and can\noften be found on logs and cable trays.\n.ti 0\nSecurity Considerations\n\
    .in 3\nSecurity is not generally a problem in normal operation, but special\n\
    measures must be taken (such as data encryption) when avian carriers\nare used\
    \ in a tactical environment.\n.ti 0\nAuthor's Address\n.nf\nDavid Waitzman\nBBN\
