- title: INTRODUCTION
  contents:
  - "INTRODUCTION\n   The NIC Internet Hostnames Server is an NCP/TCP-based host\n\
    \   information program and protocol running on the SRI-NIC\n   machine.  It is\
    \ one of a series of ARPANET/Internet name\n   services maintained by the Network\
    \ Information Center (NIC) at\n   SRI International on behalf of the Defense Communications\n\
    \   Agency (DCA).  The function of this particular server is to\n   deliver machine-readable\
    \ name/address information describing\n   networks, gateways, hosts, and eventually\
    \ domains, within the\n   internet environment.  As currently implemented, the\
    \ server\n   provides the information outlined in the DoD Internet Host\n   Table\
    \ Specification (RFC 810).\n"
- title: QUERY/RESPONSE FORMAT
  contents:
  - "QUERY/RESPONSE FORMAT\n   The name server accepts simple text query requests\
    \ of the form\n      <command key> <argument(s)> [<options>]\n   where square\
    \ brackets (\"[]\") indicate an optional field.  The\n   command key is a keyword\
    \ indicating the nature of the request.\n   The defined keys are explained below.\n\
    \   The response, on the other hand, is of the form\n      <response key> : <rest\
    \ of response>\n   where <response key> is a keyword indicating the nature of\
    \ the\n   response, and the rest of the response is interpreted in the\n   context\
    \ of the key.\n"
- title: COMMAND/RESPONSE KEYS
  contents:
  - "COMMAND/RESPONSE KEYS\n   The currently defined keywords are:\n      Command\
    \ Keys:\n         HNAME   (find entry with given name)\n         HADDR   (find\
    \ entry with given address)\n         ALL     (return entire host table)\n"

    \    Response Keys:\n         ERR     (entry not found, nature of error follows)\n\
    \         NET     (entry found, rest of entry follows)\n         GATEWAY (entry\
    \ found, rest of entry follows)\n         HOST    (entry found, rest of entry\
    \ follows)\n         BEGIN   (followed by multiple entries)\n         END    \
    \ (done with BEGIN block of entries)\n   More keywords will be added as new needs\
    \ are recognized.  A\n   more detailed description of the allowed requests/responses\n\
    \   will follow.\n"
- title: PROTOCOL
  contents:
  - "PROTOCOL\n   To access this server from a program, connect to service host\n\
    \   (SRI-NIC)\n      TCP: port 101 decimal\n      NCP: socket 101 decimal for\
    \ ICP\n   send the information query, and await the response.\n   Note:  Care\
    \ should be taken to interpret the nature of the\n   reply (e.g, single record\
    \ or multiple record), so that no\n   confusion about the state of the reply results.\
    \  An \"ALL\"\n   request will likely return several hundred or more records of\n\
    \   all types (see RFC 810), whereas \"HNAME\" or \"HADDR\" will\n   usually return\
    \ one HOST record, or \"BEGIN:\", list of host\n   records, \"END:\", if there\
    \ is more than one match.\n"
- title: QUERY/RESPONSE EXAMPLES
  contents:
  - "QUERY/RESPONSE EXAMPLES\n   1. HNAME Query - Given a name, find the entry or\
    \ entries that\n   match\n      the name.  For example:\n         HNAME SRI-NIC\
    \ <CRLF>   ;where <CRLF> is a carriage\n      return/\n                      \
    \           linefeed, and 'SRI-NIC' is a\n      host name\n      The likely response\
    \ is:\n         HOST : 10.0.0.73 : SRI-NIC,NIC : FOONLY-F3 : TENEX : NCP :\n \
    \     A response may stretch across more than one line.\n      Continuation lines\
    \ always begin with at least one space.\n      For example:\n"

  - "Hostnames Server                                           RFC 811\n   2. HADDR\
    \ Query - Given an internet address (as specified in\n   RFC\n      796) find\
    \ the entry or entries that match that address.\n      For example:\n        \
    \ HADDR 10.0.0.73 <CRLF>   ;where <CRLF> is a carriage\n      return/\n      \
    \                             linefeed, and '10.0.0.73' is a\n      host\n   \
    \                                address\n      The likely response is the same\
    \ as for the HNAME request:\n         HOST : 10.0.0.73 : SRI-NIC,NIC : FOONLY-F3\
    \ : TENEX : NCP :\n   3. ALL Query - Deliver the entire internet host table in\
    \ a\n      machine-readable form.  For example:\n         ALL <CRLF>   ;where\
    \ <CRLF> is a carriage return/linefeed\n      The likely response is the keyword\
    \ 'BEGIN' followed by a\n      colon ':', followed by the entire internet host\
    \ table in\n      the format specified in RFC 810, followed by 'END:'.  For\n\
    \      example:\n         BEGIN:\n         NET : 10.0.0.0 : ARPANET :\n      \
    \   NET : 18.0.0.0 : LCSNET :\n         GATEWAY : 10.0.0.77, 18.8.0.4 : MIT-GW\
    \ :: MOS : IP/GW :\n         HOST : 10.0.0.73 : SRI-NIC,NIC : TENEX : FOONLY-F3\n\
    \            NCP/TELNET, NCP/FTP, TCP :\n         HOST : 10.2.0.11 : SU-TIP, FELT-TIP\
    \ ::\n         END:\n"

  - "ERROR HANDLING\n   1. ERR Reply - may occur on any query, and should be permitted\n\
    \   in\n      any access program using the name server.  Errors are of\n   the\
    \ form\n      ERR : <code> : <string> :\n         as in\n      ERR : NAMNFD :\

  - "RFC 811                                                Hostnames Server\n   The\
    \ error code is a unique descriptor, limited to 8 characters\n   in length for\
    \ any given error.  It may be used by the access\n   program to identify the error\
    \ and, in some cases, to handle it\n   automatically.  The string is an accompanying\
    \ message for a\n   given error for that case where the access program simply\
    \ logs\n   the error message.  Current codes and their associated\n   interpretations\
    \ are\n      NAMNFD        --     Name not found; name not in table\n      ADRNFD\
    \        --     Address not found; address not in\n      table\n      ILLCOM \
    \       --     Illegal command; command key not\n      recognized\n      TMPSYS\
    \        --     Temporary system failure, try again\n      later\n"
- title: REMARKS
  contents:
  - "REMARKS\n   The host name server described above runs over a single global\n\
    \   internet host name/address data base.  This data base is an\n   extension\
    \ of the old ARPANET Hosts.txt file, and is being\n   maintained by the NIC to\
    \ provide continuity during the\n   transition and expansion to the internet environment.\
    \  We view\n   the central administration of a global host name data base,\n \
    \  along with this simple name server, as an interim solution on\n   the way to\
    \ a decentralized, distributed name/address\n   translation service.  The NIC\
    \ welcomes your comments and\n   suggestions for such an expanded service.  Send\
    \ comments to\n   NIC@SRI-NIC.\n"
