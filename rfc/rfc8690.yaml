  - "Abstract\n   RFC 8287 defines the extensions to perform LSP Ping and Traceroute\n
    \  for Segment Routing IGP-Prefix and IGP-Adjacency Segment Identifiers\n   (SIDs)
    with the MPLS data plane.  RFC 8287 proposes three Target\n   Forwarding Equivalence
    Class (FEC) Stack sub-TLVs.  While RFC 8287\n   defines the format and procedure
    to handle those sub-TLVs, it does\n   not sufficiently clarify how the length
    of the Segment ID sub-TLVs\n   should be computed to be included in the Length
    field of the sub-\n   TLVs.  This ambiguity has resulted in interoperability issues.\n
    \  This document updates RFC 8287 by clarifying the length of each of\n   the
    Segment ID sub-TLVs defined in RFC 8287.\n"

      length MUST\n   be calculated by including 2 octets of the Reserved field.  Table
      1\n   lists the length for different combinations of Adj. Type and\n   Protocol.\n
