- title: 1.  Introduction and Motivations
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction and Motivations\n   The proposal in this document describes\
    \ the IRIS [6] application\n   transport binding that uses BEEP [2].  Requirements\
    \ for IRIS and the\n   specification in this document are outlined in CRISP [19].\n\
    \   The choice of BEEP as the transport substrate is primarily driven by\n   the\
    \ need to reuse an existing, well-understood protocol with all the\n   necessary\
    \ features to support the requirements.  This would give\n   implementers a wealth\
    \ of toolkits and debugging gear for use in\n   constructing both servers and\
    \ clients and allow operators to apply\n   existing experience in issues of deployment.\
    \  The construction of a\n   simple application transport for the specific purpose\
    \ of IRIS would\n   yield a similar standard, though likely smaller and less complete,\n\
    \   after taking into consideration matters such as framing and\n   authentication.\n\
    \   Precedents for using other transport mechanisms in layered\n   applications\
    \ do not seem to fit with the design goals of IRIS.  HTTP\n   [15] offers many\
    \ features employed for use by similar applications.\n   However, IRIS is not\
    \ intended to be put to uses such as bypassing\n   firewalls, commingling URI\
    \ schemes, or any other methods that might\n   lead to confusion between IRIS\
    \ and traditional World Wide Web\n   applications.  Beyond adhering to the guidelines\
    \ spelled out in RFC\n   3205 [16], the use of HTTP also offers many other challenges\
    \ that\n   quickly erode its appeal.  For example, the appropriate use of TLS\n\
    \   [4] with HTTP is defined by RFC 2817 [14], but the common use, as\n   described\
    \ in RFC 2818 [18], is usually the only method in most\n   implementations.\n\
    \   Finally, the use of IRIS directly over TCP, such as that specified by\n  \
    \ EPP-TCP [17], does not offer the client negotiation characteristics\n   needed\
    \ by a referral application in which a single client, in\n   processing a query,\
    \ may traverse multiple servers operating with\n   different parameters.\n"

- title: 3.  BEEP Profile Identification
  contents:
  - "3.  BEEP Profile Identification\n   The BEEP profile identifier for IRIS is a\
    \ URI composed of the IRIS\n   schema URN, followed by a slash, followed by an\
    \ IRIS registry type\n   (which is a URN).\n   In this profile identifier, the\
    \ IRIS schema MUST be abbreviated\n   according to the rules of IRIS.  This is\
    \ possible because the IRIS\n   schema URN is compliant with XML_URN [20].\n \
    \  The registry type URN MUST be abbreviated according to the rules of\n   IRIS\
    \ (see [6]).  This is possible because the registry type URN is\n   compliant\
    \ with XML_URN [20].\n   The following is an example of an IRIS profile identifier\
    \ for BEEP.\n   It identifies the version of IRIS to match that specified by\n\
    \   \"urn:iana:params:xml:ns:iris1\" with a registry type URN of\n   \"urn:iana:params:xml:ns:dreg1\"\
    :\n      http://iana.org/beep/iris1/dreg1\n   The full ABNF [8] follows, with\
    \ certain values included from IRIS\n   [6]:\n      profile             = profile-uri\
    \ \"/\" iris-urn-abbrev\n                            \"/\" registry-urn-abbrev\n\
    \      profile-uri         = \"http://iana.org/beep/\"\n      iris-urn-abbrev\
    \     = // as specified by IRIS\n      registry-urn-abbrev = // as specified by\
    \ IRIS\n   This URI is used in the \"profile\" element in BEEP during channel\n\
    \   creation.  According to the rules of BEEP, multiple \"profile\"\n   elements\
    \ may be offered, thus allowing negotiation of the version of\n   IRIS to be used\
    \ for every registry type being served.\n   Once this profile is accepted and\
    \ the channel is created, the channel\n   is considered ready to exchange IRIS\
    \ messages.  A server MUST honor\n   queries for all advertised registry types\
    \ on any channel opened with\n   an IRIS profile URI.\n"
- title: 4.  IRIS Message Packages
  contents:
  - "4.  IRIS Message Packages\n   The BEEP profile for IRIS transmits XML [1] containing\
    \ the requests\n   and responses for IRIS registries.  These XML instances MUST\
    \ be\n   encoded as Unicode [9] using the media-type of \"application/xml\"\n\
    \   according to RFC 3023 [11].\n   XML processors are obliged to recognize both\
    \ UTF-8 and UTF-16 [9]\n   encodings.  XML allows mechanisms to identify and use\
    \ other character\n   encodings by means of the \"encoding\" attribute in the\
    \ declaration.\n   Absence of this attribute or a byte order mark (BOM) indicates\
    \ a\n   default of UTF-8 encoding.  Thus, for compatibility reasons, and per\n\
    \   RFC 2277 [12], use of UTF-8 is RECOMMENDED with this transport\n   mapping.\
    \  UTF-16 is OPTIONAL.  Other encodings MUST NOT be used.\n   A registry type\
    \ MAY define other message packages that are not IRIS\n   XML instances (e.g.,\
    \ binary images referenced by an IRIS response).\n"

- title: 5.1.  Registry Dependent Patterns
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Registry Dependent Patterns\n   Because each registry type is defined by\
    \ a separate BEEP profile (see\n   [6]), each registry type MAY define a different\
    \ message pattern.\n   These patterns MUST be within the allowable scope of BEEP\
    \ [2].  If a\n   registry type does not explicitly define a message pattern, the\n\
    \   default pattern is used (see Section 5.2).\n   However, each registry type\
    \ MUST be capable of supporting the default\n   pattern (Section 5.2) for use\
    \ with the <lookupEntity> query in IRIS.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Default Pattern
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Default Pattern\n   The default BEEP profile for IRIS only has a one-to-one\
    \ request/\n   response message pattern.  This exchange involves sending an IRIS\
    \ XML\n   instance, which results in a response of an IRIS XML instance.\n   The\
    \ client sends the request by using an \"MSG\" message containing a\n   valid\
    \ IRIS XML instance.  The server responds with an \"RPY\" message\n   containing\
    \ a valid IRIS XML instance.  The \"ERR\" message is used for\n   sending fault\
    \ codes.  The list of allowable fault codes is listed in\n   BEEP [2].\n"

- title: 6.1.  Registry Dependent Methods
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Registry Dependent Methods\n   When the TLS [4] tuning profile in BEEP\
    \ is used, it is possible to\n   verify the authenticity of the server.  However,\
    \ a convention is\n   needed to conduct this authentication.  This convention\
    \ dictates the\n   name of the authority a client uses to ask for authentication\n\
    \   credentials so that the server knows which set of credentials to pass\n  \
    \ back.  Because this is dependent on the authority component of the\n   URI,\
    \ each registry type SHOULD define a server authentication method.\n   If a registry\
    \ type does not explicitly define a server authentication\n   method, the basic\
    \ server authentication method (Section 6.2) is used.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Basic Server Authentication Method
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Basic Server Authentication Method\n   The basic server authentication\
    \ method is as follows:\n   1.  When connecting to a server, the client MUST present\
    \ the name of\n       the authority to the server by using the BEEP [2] serverName\n\
    \       mechanism.  For instance, if the URI \"iris:dreg1//com/domain/\n     \
    \  example.com\" is being resolved, the client would use the\n       serverName=\"\
    com\" attribute during the BEEP session instantiation.\n   2.  During TLS negotiation,\
    \ the server presents to the client a\n       certificate for the authority given\
    \ in serverName.  This\n       certificate MUST be an X.509 certificate [10].\
    \  This certificate\n       MUST contain the authority in either the subjectDN\
    \ or the\n       subjectAltName extension of type dNSName.\n   3.  The certificate\
    \ MUST be cryptographically verified according to\n       the procedures of TLS.\n\
    \   4.  The client then checks the subject of the certificate for a case\n   \
    \    insensitive match in the following order:\n       1.  Any of the dNSName\
    \ types in the subjectAltName.\n       2.  The subjectDN consisting solely of\
    \ 'dc' components, in which\n           each 'dc' component represents a label\
    \ from the authority\n           name (e.g., example.com is dc=example, dc=com).\n\
    \       3.  A subjectDN in which the left-most component is a 'cn'\n         \
    \  component containing the name of the authority.  A wildcard\n           character\
    \ ('*') MAY be used as the left-most label of the\n           name in the 'cn'\
    \ component.\n       If the subject of the certificate does not match any of these\n\
    \       name components, then the certificate is invalid for representing\n  \
    \     the authority.\n"
