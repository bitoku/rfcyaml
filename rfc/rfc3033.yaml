  - "2. Session-related ATM Connection\n   With the development of new multimedia\
    \ applications on the current\n   Internet, the demands for multimedia support\
    \ are increasing in the IP\n   network, which currently supports best effort communications.\
    \  In\n   particular, demands to support QoS guaranteed communications are\n \
    \  increasing with the development of voice, audio, and video\n   communications\
    \ applications.  And it may also be necessary to\n   introduce the mechanism that\
    \ can efficiently transfer the huge volume\n   of traffic expected with these\
    \ applications.\n   The major features of B-ISDN are high speed, logical multiplexing\n\
    \   with the VP/VC, and flexible QoS management per VC, so it is quite\n   natural\
    \ to use these distinctive functions of B-ISDN to implement a\n   multimedia support\
    \ mechanism in the IP network.  The flexible QoS\n   management and logical multiplexing\
    \ functions in B-ISDN are the\n   expected method of implementing the QoS guaranteed\
    \ communications in\n   the Internet.  And when a long-lived session is supported\
    \ by a\n   particular VC, efficient packet forwarding may be possible using the\n\
    \   high speed and logical multiplexing of B-ISDN.\n   This section clarifies\
    \ B-ISDN signaling functions that are required\n   when the session is supported\
    \ by the VC, for advanced B-ISDN\n   signaling support of the Internet protocol.\n"

    \ 2.1: Example scenario for establishing a VC for a long-lived\n             \
    \   session.\n   First, a session is multiplexed into the default VC connecting\
    \ the\n   routers.  Then, if a router detects that it is a long-lived session,\n\
    \   it sets up a new VC for the session.  If the new VC is established\n   successfully,\
    \ the long-lived session is moved to the new VC.\n   In this procedure involving\
    \ an ATM VC setup, the B-ISDN signaling\n   entity in the called side router must\
    \ detect that the incoming call\n   corresponds to a session of the Internet protocol\
    \ and notify that\n   fact to the IP layer entity.  Based on this information,\
    \ the IP layer\n   entity moves the session to the new VC.\n   Therefore, to implement\
    \ this signaling procedure, the B-ISDN\n   signaling must include an session identifier\
    \ as an information\n   element.  The B-LLI, B-HLI, User-user, and Generic Identifier\n\
    \   information elements are all capable of transferring this\n   information.\
    \  Considering the original purposes of these information\n   elements, the most\
    \ appropriate one to use is the Generic Identifier\n   information element.\n"
- title: 2.2 QoS-sensitive Session Signaling
  contents:
  - "2.2 QoS-sensitive Session Signaling\n   The major difference between QoS-sensitive\
    \ session signaling and\n   long-lived session signaling is that call setup is\
    \ not initiated by\n   the detection of a long-lived session, but is explicitly\
    \ initiated by\n   the setup protocol such as RSVP.  To implement QoS-sensitive\
    \ session\n   signaling using ATM, the ATM network between the routers must forward\n\
    \   not only the session identifier but also the setup protocol.\n   There are\
    \ two schemes for forwarding the setup protocol.  One is to\n   multiplex the\
    \ protocol into a default VC connecting the routers, or\n   to forward the protocol\
    \ through a particular VC.  In this case, the\n   QoS-sensitive session and the\
    \ ATM VC are established sequentially.\n   The second scheme is to forward the\
    \ setup protocol as an information\n   element in the B-ISDN signaling.  In this\
    \ case, the QoS-sensitive\n   session and the ATM VC are established simultaneously.\
    \  The latter\n   scheme has the following advantages compared with the former\
    \ one.\n   o Easier to implement.\n     - Admission control is simplified, because\
    \ admission control for\n       the IP and ATM layers can be done simultaneously.\n\
    \     - Watchdog timer processing is simplified, because there is no need\n  \
    \     to watch the IP layer establishment and ATM layer establishment\n      \
    \ sequentially.\n   o If the setup protocol supports negotiation, then an ATM\
    \ VC whose\n     QoS is based on the result of negotiation can be established.\n\
    \   However, the latter scheme, at least, cannot support a case where a\n   PVC\
    \ is used to support a QoS-sensitive session.  Therefore, both\n   procedures\
    \ should be taken into account.\n   An example of a message sequence that simultaneously\
    \ establishes a\n   QoS-sensitive session and an ATM VC is shown in Fig. 2.2.\n\

    \ the ATM network may contain a User-user information\n   element.  The ATM network\
    \ transfers the User-user information element\n   transparently if it contains\
    \ no coding rule errors.\n   From the viewpoint of B-ISDN signaling applications,\
    \ it seems the\n   Generic Identifier and User-to-user Signaling are similar functions.\n\
    \   But their rules for processing exceptions are not completely the\n   same,\

    \ for the transfer of identifiers between the c-planes,\n   while the User-to-user\
    \ Signaling is designed for the transfer of user\n   data via the c-planes.  Another\
    \ difference is that the latter\n   supports interworking with the user-user information\
    \ element in the\n   Q.931 N-ISDN signaling, but the Generic Identifier does not.\
    \  Note\n   that the ATM network may check the contents of the Generic Identifier\n\

    \ transferred\n   between end-to-end users may contain up to three Generic Identifier\n\
    \   information elements.  These elements may contain multiple\n   identifiers.\
    \  This document does not specify the order of identifiers\n   when multiple identifiers\
    \ appear in a signaling message.\n   This document also does not specify the semantics\
    \ when multiple\n   identifiers having the same Identifier type appear in a signaling\n\
    \   message, or when a signaling message contains a Generic Identifier\n   information\
    \ element that does not contain identifiers.\n   When a B-ISDN signaling message\
    \ containing a Generic Identifier\n   information element enters an ATM network\
    \ that does not support the\n   Generic Identifier, the network clears the call,\
    \ discards the\n   information element, or discards the signaling message.  (See\n\
    \   sections 4.5.1 and 5.6.8.1 of Q.2931 and section 9.3 of Q.2941.1 for\n   details.)\n\
    \   To enable reliable Generic Identifier information element transfer,\n   when\
    \ the calling party sends a SETUP or ADD PARTY message with up to\n   three Generic\
    \ Identifier information elements, the CONNECT or ADD\n   PARTY ACK message returned\
    \ by the called party must contain at least\n   one Generic Identifier information\
    \ element.  The called party may not\n   respond with the same identifiers received\
    \ from the calling party.\n   The calling party should confirm that the response\
    \ message contains\n   at least one Generic Identifier information element.  This\
    \ rule\n   enables identifier negotiation; this document does not specify the\n\
    \   detailed procedure of this negotiation.\n"
