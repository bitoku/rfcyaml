  - "3.  Introduction\n   Cable Television Laboratories, Inc. (CableLabs) is a non-profit\n
    \  research and development consortium that serves the cable television\n   industry
    via design and specification of new and emerging broadband\n   service architectures.
    \ Several CableLabs initiatives define DHCP\n   clients that have specific DHCP
    configuration requirements.  One such\n   initiative is the PacketCable project.\n
    \  The PacketCable project is aimed at architecting, qualifying, and\n   supporting
    Internet-based multimedia services over cable-based packet\n   networks.  These
    new multimedia services will include telephony and\n   videoconferencing, delivered
    using the basic Internet Protocol (IP)\n   technology that is used to send data
    via the Internet.\n   PacketCable 1.0 provides Voice over IP (VoIP) service delivery.
    \ The\n   VoIP service is supported at the customer site by two key components:\n
    \  a Cable Modem (CM) and a Media Terminal Adapter (MTA).  The CM\n   converts
    the cable RF signals to/from various IP voice protocols,\n   while the MTA converts
    the VoIP protocols into analog telephony\n   compatible with a common telephone.\n
    \  The CM and MTA may be packaged together or separately.  If packaged\n   together,
    the unit is referred to as an Embedded-MTA (EMTA - depicted\n   in Figure 1).
    \ If packaged separately, the MTA is referred to as a\n   Standalone MTA (SMTA).\n

    1. PacketCable 1.0 Embedded-MTA\n   The CM and MTA are distinct IP devices: each
    has its own MAC address\n   and IP configuration.  The CM and MTA utilize the
    DHCP protocol to\n   obtain IP configuration.  It is assumed that the CM and MTA
    may be\n   administered by different business entities.  The CM communicates\n
    \  with and is configured by the Data Access Provider's (DAP's) DHCP\n   servers.
    \ Likewise, the MTA communicates with and is configured by\n   the Telephony Service
    Provider's (TSP's) DHCP servers.\n   The PacketCable architecture requires that
    the business entity\n   controlling the configuration of the CM also determines
    which\n   business entities control the configuration of the MTA.  This is\n   similar
    to the example found in the PSTN system: individuals can pick\n   their long distance
    carriers even though the ultimate control of\n   their telephone remains with
    the local carrier.\n   Due to specific needs of the MTA configuration process
    (described in\n   [7]), a new CableLabs Client Configuration (CCC) option is needed
    for\n   the DHCP protocol.  Both CM and MTA DHCP clients will request this\n   option.
    \ When requested, both the DAP and TSP DHCP servers will\n   populate this option
    into DHCP responses.  See section 6 for further\n   operational details.\n   It
    should be noted that, although the CCC option will be initially\n   deployed to
    support PacketCable VOIP applications, the CCC option\n   will also be used to
    support various non VOIP applications.  Use of\n   the CCC option does not necessarily
    mean that the service provider is\n   a TSP.\n"

    are discussed in\n   section 7 of the DHCP protocol specification [6] and in\n
    \  Authentication for DHCP Messages [9].\n   The CCC option can be used to misdirect
    network traffic by providing\n   incorrect DHCP server addresses, incorrect provisioning
    server\n   addresses, and incorrect Kerberos realm names to a Cablelabs client\n
    \  device.  This misdirection can lead to several threat scenarios.  A\n   Denial
    of Service (DoS) attack can result from address information\n   being simply invalid.
    \ A man-in-the-middle attack can be mounted by\n   providing addresses to a potential
    snooper.  A malicious TSP can\n   steal customers from the customer selected TSP,
    by altering the\n   Kerberos realm designation.\n   These threats are mitigated
    by several factors.\n   Within the cable delivery architecture required by PacketCable,
    the\n   DHCP client is connected to a network through a cable modem and the\n
    \  CMTS (head-end).  The CMTS is explicitly configured with a set of\n   DHCP
    servers to which DHCP requests are forwarded.  Further, a\n   correctly configured
    CMTS will only allow downstream traffic from\n   specific IP addresses/ranges.\n
    \  Assuming that server addresses and Kerberos realm name were\n   successfully
    spoofed to the point that a malicious client device was\n   able to contact a
    KDC, the client device must still present valid\n   certificates to the KDC before
    being service enabled.  Given the\n   computational overhead of the certificate
    validation process, this\n   situation could present a DoS opportunity.\n   Finally,
    it is possible for a malicious (although certified) TSP to\n   redirect a customer
    from the customer's selected TSP.  It is assumed\n   that all TSP's permitted
    onto an access providers network are trusted\n   entities that will cooperate
    to insure peaceful coexistence.  If a\n   TSP is found to be redirecting customers,
    this should be handled as\n   an administrative matter between the access provider
    and the TSP.\n"
