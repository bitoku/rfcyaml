  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   When a Location Information Server receives a request for location\n\
    \   information (using the locationRequest message), described in the\n   base\
    \ HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) specification, it uses the\n   source\
    \ IP address of the arriving message as a pointer to the\n   location determination\
    \ process.  This is sufficient in environments\n   where the location of a Device\
    \ can be determined based on its IP\n   address.\n   Two additional use cases\
    \ are addressed by this document.  In the\n   first, location configuration requires\
    \ additional or alternative\n   identifiers from the source IP address provided\
    \ in the request.  In\n   the second, an entity other than the Device requests\
    \ the location of\n   the Device.\n   This document extends the HELD protocol\
    \ to allow the location request\n   message to carry Device identifiers.  Privacy\
    \ and security\n   considerations describe the conditions where requests containing\n\
    \   identifiers are permitted.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Protocols for requesting and providing location information\
    \ require a\n   way for the requestor to specify the location that should be\n\
    \   returned.  In a Location Configuration Protocol (LCP), the location\n   being\
    \ requested is the requestor's location.  This fact can make the\n   problem of\
    \ identifying the Device simple, since IP datagrams that\n   carry the request\
    \ already carry an identifier for the Device --\n   namely, the source IP address\
    \ of an incoming request.  Existing LCPs,\n   such as HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery\
    \ (HELD) [RFC5985] and DHCP\n   ([RFC3825], [RFC4776]) rely on the source IP address\
    \ or other\n   information present in protocol datagrams to identify a Device.\n\
    \   Aside from the datagrams that form a request, a Location Information\n   Server\
    \ (LIS) does not necessarily have access to information that\n   could further\
    \ identify the Device.  In some circumstances, as shown\n   in [RFC5687], additional\
    \ identification information can be included\n   in a request to identify a Device.\n\
    \   This document extends the HELD protocol to support the inclusion of\n   additional\
    \ identifiers for the Device in HELD location requests.  An\n   XML schema is\
    \ defined that provides a structure for including these\n   identifiers in HELD\
    \ requests.\n   An important characteristic of this addition is that the HELD\n\
    \   protocol with identity extensions implemented is not considered an\n   LCP.\
    \  The scope of an LCP is limited to the interaction between a\n   Device and\
    \ a LIS, and LCPs can guarantee the identity of Devices\n   without additional\
    \ authorization checks.  A LIS identifies the Device\n   making the LCP request\
    \ using the source addressing on the request\n   packets, using return routability\
    \ to ensure that these identifiers\n   are not spoofed.\n   HELD with identity\
    \ extensions allows a requestor to explicitly\n   provide identification details\
    \ in the body of a location request.\n   This means that location requests can\
    \ be made in cases where\n   additional Device identity checks are necessary,\
    \ and in cases where\n   the requestor is not the Device itself.  Third-party\
    \ Location\n   Recipients (LRs) are able to make requests that include identifiers\n\
    \   to retrieve location information about a particular Device.\n   The usage\
    \ of identifiers in HELD introduces a new set of privacy\n   concerns.  In an\
    \ LCP, the requestor can be implicitly authorized to\n   access the requested\
    \ location information, because it is their own\n   location.  In contrast, a\
    \ third-party LR must be explicitly\n   authorized when requesting the location\
    \ of a Device.  Establishing\n   appropriate authorization and other related privacy\
    \ concerns are\n   discussed in Section 4.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Applications
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Applications\n   This document defines a means to explicitly include Device\
    \ identity\n   information in the body of a HELD location request.  This identity\n\
    \   information is used to identify the Device that is the subject (or\n   Target)\
    \ of the location request.  If Device identity is present, the\n   identity of\
    \ the requestor in the form of the source IP address is not\n   used to identify\
    \ the subject of the request.\n   Device identifiers in HELD can be used for two\
    \ purposes:\n   Location configuration:  A Device can use these parameters to\n\
    \      identify itself to a LIS.  Identification information other than\n    \
    \  an IP address might be needed to determine the location of a\n      Device.\n\
    \      A LIS can authorize location configuration requests using a policy\n  \
    \    that allows Devices to acquire their own location (see\n      Section 4.1).\
    \  If an unauthorized third party falsifies addressing\n      on request packets\
    \ to match the provided Device identity, the\n      request might be erroneously\
    \ authorized under this policy.\n      Requests containing Device identity MUST\
    \ NOT be authorized using\n      this policy unless specific measures are taken\
    \ to prevent this\n      type of attack.\n      This document describes a mechanism\
    \ that provides assurances that\n      the requestor and included Device identity\
    \ are the same for the\n      Network Access Identifier (NAI) in a WiMAX network.\
    \  The LIS MUST\n      treat requests containing other identifiers as third-party\n\
    \      requests, unless it is able to ensure that the provided Device\n      identity\
    \ is uniquely attributable to the requestor.\n   Third-party requests:  A third-party\
    \ Location Recipient can be\n      granted authorization to make requests for\
    \ a given Device.  In\n      particular, network services can be permitted to\
    \ retrieve location\n      for a Device that is unable to acquire location information\
    \ for\n      itself (see Section 6.3 of [EMERGENCY-CALLING]).  This allows use\n\
    \      of location-dependent applications -- particularly essential\n      services\
    \ like emergency calling -- where Devices do not support a\n      location configuration\
    \ protocol or they are unable to successfully\n      retrieve location information.\n\
    \      This document does not describe how a third party acquires an\n      identifier\
    \ for a Device, nor how that third party is authorized by\n      a LIS.  It is\
    \ critical that these issues are resolved before\n      permitting a third-party\
    \ request.  A pre-arranged contract between\n      the third party, a Rule Maker,\
    \ and the LIS operator is necessary\n      to use Device identifiers in this fashion.\
    \  This contract must\n      include how the request is authenticated and the\
    \ set of\n      identifiers (and types of identifiers) that the third party is\n\
    \      authorized to use in requests.\n      Automated mechanisms to ensure that\
    \ privacy constraints are\n      respected are possible.  For instance, a policy\
    \ rules document\n      could be used to express the agreed policy.  Formal policy\n\
    \      documents, such as the common policy [RFC4745], can be applied in\n   \
    \   an automated fashion by a LIS.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Terminology\n   This document uses the term Location Information Server\
    \ (LIS) and\n   Location Configuration Protocol (LCP) as described in [RFC5687]\
    \ and\n   [GEOPRIV-ARCH].\n   The term Device is used specifically as the subject\
    \ of an LCP,\n   consistent with [RFC5985].  This document also uses the term\
    \ Target\n   to refer to any entity that might be a subject of the same location\n\
    \   information.  Target is used in a more general sense, including the\n   Device,\
    \ but also any nearby entity, such as the user of a Device.\n   A Target has a\
    \ stake in setting authorization policy on the use of\n   location information.\
    \  A Rule Maker is the term used for the role\n   that makes policy decisions\
    \ about authorization, determining what\n   entities are permitted to receive\
    \ location and how that information\n   is provided.\n   Device, Target, and Rule\
    \ Maker are defined in [GEOPRIV-ARCH].\n   The term \"requestor\" is used in this\
    \ document to refer to the entity\n   making a HELD request.\n   The key words\
    \ \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\"\
    , \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document\
    \ are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Device Identity
  contents:
  - "2.  Device Identity\n   Identifiers are used as the starting point in location\
    \ determination.\n   Identifiers might be associated with a different Device over\
    \ time,\n   but their purpose is to identify the Device, not to describe its\n\
    \   environment or network attachment.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Identifier Suitability
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Identifier Suitability\n   Use of any identifier MUST only be allowed if\
    \ it identifies a single\n   Device at the time that location is determined. \
    \ The LIS is\n   responsible for ensuring that location information is correct\
    \ for the\n   Device, which includes ensuring that the identifier is uniquely\n\
    \   attributable to the Device.\n   Some identifiers can be either temporary or\
    \ could potentially\n   identify multiple Devices.  Identifiers that are transient\
    \ or\n   ambiguous could be exploited by an attacker to either gain\n   information\
    \ about another Device or to coerce the LIS into producing\n   misleading information.\n\
    \   The identifiers described in this document MUST only be used where\n   that\
    \ identifier is used as the basis for location determination.\n   Considerations\
    \ relating to the use of identifiers for a Device\n   requesting its own location\
    \ are discussed in Section 5 of [RFC5687];\n   this section discusses use of identifiers\
    \ for authorized third-party\n   requests.\n      It is tempting for a LIS implementation\
    \ to allow alternative\n      identifiers for convenience or some other perceived\
    \ benefit.  The\n      LIS is responsible for ensuring that the identifier used\
    \ in the\n      request does not refer to a Device other than the one for which\
    \ it\n      determines location.\n   Some identifiers are always uniquely attributable\
    \ to a single Device.\n   However, other identifiers can have a different meaning\
    \ to different\n   entities on a network.  This is especially true for IP addresses\n\
    \   [RFC2101], but this can be true for other identifiers to varying\n   degrees.\
    \  Non-uniqueness arises from both topology (all network\n   entities have a subjective\
    \ view of the network) and time (the network\n   changes over time).\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  Subjective Network Views
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Subjective Network Views\n   Subjective views of the network mean that\
    \ the identifier a requestor\n   uses to refer to one physical entity could actually\
    \ apply to a\n   different physical entity when used in a different network context.\n\
    \   Unless an authorized third-party requestor and LIS operate in the\n   same\
    \ network context, each could have a different subjective view of\n   the meaning\
    \ of the identifier.\n   Where subjective views differ, the third party receives\
    \ information\n   that is correct only within the network context of the LIS.\
    \  The\n   location information provided by the LIS is probably misleading: the\n\
    \   requestor believes that the information relates to a different entity\n  \
    \ than it was generated for.\n   Authorization policy can be affected by a subjective\
    \ network view if\n   it is applied based on an identifier or if its application\
    \ depends on\n   identifiers.  The subjective view presented to the LIS and Rule\
    \ Maker\n   need to agree for the two entities to understand policy on the same\n\
    \   terms.  For instance, it is possible that the LIS could apply the\n   incorrect\
    \ authorization policy if it selects the policy using a\n   subjective identifier.\
    \  Alternatively, it may use the correct policy\n   but apply it incorrectly if\
    \ subjective identifiers are used.\n      In IP networks, network address translation\
    \ (NAT) and other forms\n      of address modification create network contexts.\
    \  Entities on\n      either side of the point where modification occurs have\
    \ a\n      different view of the network.  Private use addresses [RFC1918]\n \
    \     are the most easily recognizable identifiers that have limited\n      scope.\n\
    \   A LIS can be configured to recognize scenarios where the subjective\n   view\
    \ of a requestor or Rule Maker might not coincide with the view of\n   the LIS.\
    \  The LIS can either provide location information that takes\n   the view of\
    \ the requestor into account, or it can reject the request.\n      For instance,\
    \ a LIS might operate within a network that uses a\n      private address space,\
    \ with NAT between that network and other\n      networks.  A third-party request\
    \ that originates in an external\n      network with an IP address from the private\
    \ address space might\n      not be valid -- it could be identifying an entity\
    \ within another\n      address space.  The LIS can be configured to reject such\
    \ requests,\n      unless it knows by other means that the request is valid.\n\
    \      In the same example, the requestor might include an address from\n    \
    \  the external space in an attempt to identify a host within the\n      network.\
    \  The LIS could use knowledge about how the external\n      address is mapped\
    \ to a private address, if that mapping is fixed,\n      to determine an appropriate\
    \ response.\n   The residential gateway scenario in Section 3.1 of [RFC5687] is\
    \ a\n   particular example of where a subjective view is permitted.  The LIS\n\
    \   knowingly provides Devices on the remote side of the residential\n   gateway\
    \ with location information.  The LIS provides location\n   information with appropriate\
    \ uncertainty to allow for the fact that\n   the residential gateway serves a\
    \ small geographical area.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  Transient Identifiers
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Transient Identifiers\n   Some identifiers are temporary and can, over\
    \ the course of time, be\n   assigned to different physical entities.  An identifier\
    \ that is\n   reassigned between the time that a request is formulated by a\n\
    \   requestor and when the request is received by the LIS causes the LIS\n   to\
    \ locate a different entity than the requestor intended.  The\n   response from\
    \ the LIS might be accurate, but the request incorrectly\n   associates this information\
    \ with the wrong subject.\n   A LIS should be configured with information about\
    \ any potentially\n   temporary identifiers.  It can use this information to identify\
    \ when\n   changes have occurred.  A LIS must not provide location information\n\
    \   if the identifier it uses might refer to a different Device.  If an\n   identifier\
    \ might have been reassigned recently, or it is likely to be\n   reassigned, it\
    \ is not suitable as an identifier.\n   It's possible that some degree of uncertainty\
    \ could persist where\n   identifiers are reassigned frequently; the extent to\
    \ which errors\n   arising from using transient identifiers are tolerated is a\
    \ matter\n   for local policy.\n"
- title: 2.1.3.  Network Interfaces and Devices
  contents:
  - "2.1.3.  Network Interfaces and Devices\n   Several of the identifiers in this\
    \ document are used to identify a\n   network interface.  A Device can have multiple\
    \ network interfaces.\n   Uniquely identifying any network interface is assumed\
    \ to be\n   sufficient to identify the Device.  When a network interface is\n\
    \   identified, the goal is to identify the Device that is immediately\n   attached\
    \ to the network interface.\n   Most network interfaces remain physically attached\
    \ to a particular\n   Device, though a network interface might be physically separable\
    \ from\n   the Device.  By identifying a network interface, any Device that is\n\

- title: 2.2.  Identifier Format and Protocol Details
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Identifier Format and Protocol Details\n   XML elements are used to express\
    \ the Device identity.  The \"device\"\n   element is used as a general container\
    \ for identity information.\n   This document defines a basic set of identifiers.\
    \  An example HELD\n   request, shown in Figure 1, includes an IP version 4 address.\n\

    \  Sequences of octets that do not represent a valid UTF-8\n   encoding can be\
    \ expressed using a backslash ('\\') followed by two\n   case-insensitive hexadecimal\
    \ digits representing the value of a\n   single octet.\n   The canonical representation\
    \ of an NAI is the sequence of octets that\n   is produced from the concatenation\

    \ escaped components.  The\n   resulting sequence of octets MUST conform to the\
    \ constraints in\n   [RFC4282].\n   For example, the NAI \"f<U+FC>\\<0xFF>@bar.com\"\

- title: 3.4.1.  Using NAI for Location Configuration
  contents:
  - "3.4.1.  Using NAI for Location Configuration\n   An NAI in WiMAX is uniquely\
    \ attributable to a single Device at any\n   one time.  An NAI either identifies\
    \ a Device or a service\n   subscription, neither of which can have multiple active\
    \ sessions.\n   In a WiMAX network, an IP address is not sufficient information\
    \ for a\n   LIS to locate a Device.  The following procedure relies on an NAI\
    \ to\n   identify the Device.  This procedure and the messages and parameters\n\
    \   is relies upon are defined in [WiMAX-T33-110-R015v01-B].\n   Location requests\
    \ in a WiMAX network always require the inclusion of\n   an NAI.  However, if\
    \ a LIS receives a request that does not come from\n   an authenticated and authorized\
    \ third-party requestor, it can treat\n   this request as a location configuration\
    \ request.\n   After receiving a location request that includes an NAI, the LIS\n\
    \   sends a \"Location-Requestor-Authentication-Protocol\" access request\n  \
    \ message to the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)\n   server.\
    \  This request includes an \"MS-Identity-Assertion\" parameter\n   containing\
    \ the NAI.\n   The AAA server consults network policy, and if the request is\n\
    \   permitted, the response includes the IP address that is currently\n   assigned\
    \ to the Device.  If this IP address matches the source IP\n   address of the\
    \ HELD location request, the location request can be\n   authorized under the\
    \ LCP policy (see Section 4.1).  Otherwise, the\n   request must be treated as\
    \ a third-party request.\n   This relies on the same protections against IP address\
    \ spoofing that\n   are required by [RFC5985].  In addition, the request made\
    \ of the AAA\n   uses either Diameter [RFC3588] or RADIUS [RFC2865], and therefore\n\
    \   relies on the protections provided by those protocols.  In order to\n   rely\
    \ on the access request, the AAA server MUST be authenticated to\n   be a trusted\
    \ entity for the purpose of providing a link between the\n   NAI and IP address.\
    \  The AAA protocol MUST also provide protection\n   from modification and replay\
    \ attacks to ensure that data cannot be\n   altered by an attacker.\n"

    \   routability may also not apply to requests from Targets for their own\n  \
    \ location, depending on the anti-spoofing mechanisms employed for the\n   identifier.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Targets Requesting Their Own Location
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Targets Requesting Their Own Location\n   When a Target uses identity extensions\
    \ to obtain its own location,\n   HELD can no longer be considered an LCP.  The\
    \ authorization policy\n   that the LIS uses to respond to these requests must\
    \ be provisioned by\n   one or more Rule Makers.\n   In the case that the LIS\
    \ exclusively provides Targets with their own\n   locations, the LIS can still\
    \ be said to be following the \"LCP\n   policy\".  The \"LCP policy\" concept\
    \ and further security and privacy\n   considerations can be found in [GEOPRIV-ARCH].\n\
    \   The spoofing protections provided when using HELD with identity\n   extensions\
    \ to provide Targets with their own locations differ from\n   the protections\
    \ inherent in an LCP.  For an LCP, return routability\n   is considered sufficient\
    \ protection against spoofing.  For a similar\n   policy to be used, specific\
    \ measures MUST be defined to protect\n   against spoofing of the alternative\
    \ identifier.  This document\n   defines this for an NAI when used in WiMAX networks\
    \ (see\n   Section 3.4.1), but for no other identifier.\n   A Rule Maker might\
    \ require an assurance that the identifier is owned\n   by the requestor.  Any\
    \ multi-stage verification process that includes\n   a return routability test\
    \ cannot provide any stronger assurance than\n   return routability alone; therefore,\
    \ policy might require the use of\n   additional, independent methods of verification.\n\
    \   Care is required where a direct one-to-one relationship between\n   requestor\
    \ and Device identity does not exist.  If identifiers are not\n   uniquely attributable\
    \ to a single Device, the use of HELD identity\n   extensions to provide Targets\
    \ with their own locations could be\n   exploited by an attacker.\n      It might\
    \ be possible in some networks to establish multiple\n      concurrent sessions\
    \ using the same credentials.  For instance,\n      Devices with different MAC\
    \ addresses might be granted concurrent\n      access to a network using the same\
    \ NAI.  It is not appropriate to\n      provide Targets with their own locations\
    \ based on the NAI in this\n      case.  Neither is it appropriate to authenticate\
    \ a Device using\n      NAI and allow that Device to provide an unauthenticated\
    \ MAC\n      address as a Device identifier, even if the MAC address is\n    \
    \  registered to the NAI.  The MAC address potentially identifies a\n      different\
    \ Device than the one that is making the request.  The\n      correct way of gaining\
    \ authorization is to establish a policy that\n      permits this particular request\
    \ as a third-party request.\n   Section 3.4.1 discusses the implications of using\
    \ an NAI as an\n   identifier for location requests made of a LIS serving a WiMAX\n\

- title: 4.2.  Third-Party Requests
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Third-Party Requests\n   The \"LCP policy\" does not allow requests made\
    \ by third parties.  If a\n   LIS permits requests from third parties using Device\
    \ identity, it\n   assumes the rule of a Location Server (LS).  As a Location\
    \ Server,\n   the LIS MUST explicitly authorize requests according to the policies\n\
    \   that are provided by Rule Makers, including the Target.  The LIS MUST\n  \
    \ also authenticate requestors according to any agreed-upon\n   authorization\
    \ policy.\n   An organization that provides a LIS that allows third-party requests\n\
    \   must provide a means for a Rule Maker to specify authorization\n   policies\
    \ as part of the LIS implementation (e.g, in the form of\n   access control lists).\
    \  Authorization must be established before\n   allowing third-party requests\
    \ for the location of any Target.  Until\n   an authorization policy is established,\
    \ the LIS MUST reject requests\n   by third parties (that is, the default policy\
    \ is \"deny all\").\n   When the LIS is operated by an access network, the relationship\n\
    \   between the Target and the LIS can be transient.  As the Target is a\n   potential\
    \ Rule Maker, this presents a problem.  However, the process\n   of establishing\
    \ network access usually results in a form of agreement\n   between the Target\
    \ and the network provider.  This process offers a\n   natural vehicle for establishing\
    \ location privacy policies.\n   Establishing authorization policy might be a\
    \ manual process, an\n   explicit part of the terms of service for the network,\
    \ or an\n   automated system that accepts formal authorization policies (see\n\
    \   [RFC4745] and [RFC4825]).  This document does not mandate any\n   particular\

    \  provide at least this degree of assurance.  For requests that include\n   Device\

    \ transience can lead to incorrect location information\n   being provided.  An\
