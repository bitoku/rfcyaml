  contents:
  - "1.1.  Definition\n   Infrastructure ENUM is defined as the use of the technology\
    \ in RFC\n   3761 [1] by the carrier-of-record (as defined below) for a specific\n\
    \   E.164 number [2] to publish the mapping of the E.164 number into a\n   URI\
    \ [3] that identifies a specific point of interconnection to that\n   service\
    \ provider's network.  It is separate from any URIs that the\n   end user, who\
    \ registers their E.164 number, may wish to associate\n   with that E.164 number.\n\
    \   \"Infrastructure ENUM\" is distinguished from \"End User ENUM\", defined\n\
    \   in RFC3761 [1], in which the entity or person having the right to use\n  \
    \ a number has the sole discretion about the content of the associated\n   domain\
    \ and thus the zone content.  From a domain registration\n   perspective, the\
    \ end user number assignee is thus the registrant.\n   Within the infrastructure\
    \ ENUM namespace, we use the term \"carrier-\n   of-record\" for the entity having\
    \ discretion over the domain and zone\n   content and acting as the registrant.\
    \  The \"carrier-of-record\" is:\n   o The Service Provider to which the E.164\
    \ number was allocated for\n   end user assignment, whether by the National Regulatory\
    \ Authority\n   (NRA) or the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), for\n\
    \   instance, a code under \"International Networks\" (+882) or \"Universal\n\
    \   Personal Telecommunications (UPT)\" (+878) or,\n   o if the number is ported,\
    \ the service provider to which the number\n   was ported, or\n   o where numbers\
    \ are assigned directly to end users, the service\n   provider that the end user\
    \ number assignee has chosen to provide a\n   Public Switched Telephone Network/Public\
    \ Land Mobile Network (PSTN/\n   PLMN) point-of-interconnect for the number.\n\
    \   It is understood that the definition of carrier-of-record within a\n   given\
    \ jurisdiction is subject to modification by national\n   authorities.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Background
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Background\n   Voice service providers use E.164 numbers currently as their\
    \ main\n   naming and routing vehicle.  Infrastructure ENUM in e164.arpa or\n\
    \   another publicly available tree allows service providers to link\n   Internet-based\
    \ resources such as URIs to E.164 numbers.  This allows\n   service providers,\
    \ in addition to interconnecting via the PSTN/PLMN\n   (or exclusively), to peer\
    \ via IP-based protocols.  Service providers\n   may announce all E.164 numbers\
    \ or number ranges they host, regardless\n   of whether the final end user device\
    \ is on the Internet, on IP-based\n   open or closed Next Generation Networks\
    \ (NGNs), or on the PSTN or\n   PLMN, provided that an access point of some type\
    \ to the destination\n   service provider's network is available on the Internet.\
    \  There is\n   also no guarantee that the originating service provider querying\n\
    \   infrastructure ENUM is able to access the ingress network element of\n   the\
    \ destination provider's network.  Additional peering and\n   accounting agreements\
    \ requiring authentication may be necessary.  The\n   access provided may also\
    \ be to a shared network of a group of\n   providers, resolving the final destination\
    \ network within the shared\n   network.\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP\
    \ 14, RFC2119 [4].\n"
- title: 3.  Requirements for Infrastructure ENUM
  contents:
  - "3.  Requirements for Infrastructure ENUM\n   1.  Infrastructure ENUM SHALL provide\
    \ a means for a provider to\n       populate DNS resource records (RRs) for the\
    \ E.164 numbering\n       resources for which it is the carrier-of-record in a\
    \ single\n       common publicly accessible namespace.  The single common\n  \
    \     namespace ultimately designated may or may not be the same as\n       that\
    \ designated for End User ENUM (e164.arpa.)  The Fully-\n       Qualified Domain\
    \ Name (FQDN) in the resulting resource records\n       will not necessarily belong\
    \ to or identify the carrier-of-record.\n   2.  Queries of infrastructure ENUM\
    \ fully qualified domain names MUST\n       return a result, even if the result\
    \ is Refused (RCODE = 5).\n       Queries must not be rejected without response,\
    \ e.g., based on\n       access control lists.\n   3.  Infrastructure ENUM SHALL\
    \ support RRs providing a URI that can\n       identify a point of interconnection\
    \ for delivery to the carrier-\n       of-record of communications addressed to\
    \ the E.164 number.\n   4.  Infrastructure ENUM SHOULD be able to support an Internet\n\
    \       Registry Information Service (IRIS) [5] capability that allows\n     \
    \  qualified parties to obtain information regarding the E.164\n       numbering\
    \ resources and the corresponding carrier-of-record.\n       Determination of\
    \ what information, if any, shall be available\n       which parties for geographic\
    \ numbers is a national matter.\n   5.  Implementation of infrastructure ENUM\
    \ MUST NOT restrict the\n       ability of an end user, in a competitive environment,\
    \ to choose a\n       Registrar and/or name server provider for End User ENUM\n\
    \       registrations.\n   6.  The domain name chosen for infrastructure ENUM\
    \ and any parent\n       domains MUST be hosted on name servers that have performance\n\
    \       characteristics and supporting infrastructure that is comparable\n   \
    \    to those deployed for the Internet root name servers.  Those name\n     \
    \  servers for infrastructure ENUM should be configured and operated\n       according\
    \ to the guidelines described in [6].\n   7.  Infrastructure ENUM MUST meet all\
    \ reasonable privacy concerns\n       about visibility of information over which\
    \ an end user has no\n       control.  It should, for example, support mechanisms\
    \ to prevent\n       discovery of unlisted numbers by comparison of ENUM registrations\n\
    \       against directory listings, or inadvertent disclosure of user\n      \
    \ identity.\n   8.  Proposed implementations of infrastructure ENUM SHOULD:\n\
    \       A.  Minimize changes required to existing requirements that are\n    \
    \       part of RFC 3761.\n       B.  Work with open as well as closed numbering\
    \ plans.\n       C.  Not require additional functionality of resolvers at large\n\
    \           though they may require additional functionality in service\n    \
    \       provider resolvers that would make use of infrastructure\n           ENUM.\n\
    \       D.  Minimize the number of lookups required to obtain as many\n      \
    \     NAPTR (Naming Authority Pointer) records (end user and\n           infrastructure)\
    \ as possible.\n       E.  Minimize knowledge of the numbering plan required of\n\
    \           resolvers making use of Infrastructure ENUM.\n       F.  Maximize\
    \ synergies with End User ENUM.\n       G.  Support interworking with private\
    \ ENUM trees.  (In this\n           context, a private ENUM tree is one that is\
    \ not under\n           e164.arpa or whatever namespace is chosen for infrastructure\n\
    \           ENUM but uses instead a privately held domain.)\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Existing security considerations for ENUM (detailed\
    \ in [1]) still\n   apply.  Since infrastructure ENUM involves carriers where\
    \ RFC 3761\n   mainly considered indviduals, implementations meeting these\n \
    \  requirements SHOULD reconsider the RFC 3761 security model given this\n   difference\
    \ in actors concerned.  Note that some registration\n   validation issues concerning\
    \ End User ENUM may not apply to\n   infrastructure ENUM.  Where the Tier 1 registry\
    \ is able to identify\n   the provider serving a number, e.g., based on industry\
    \ data for\n   number block assignments and number portability, registration might\n\
    \   be more easily automated and a separate registrar not required.\n   Some parties\
    \ have expressed concern that an infrastructure ENUM could\n   compromise end\
    \ user privacy by making it possible for others to\n   identify unlisted or unpublished\
    \ numbers based on their registration\n   in ENUM.  This can be avoided if providers\
    \ register all of the their\n   allocated (as opposed to assigned) numbers.  Unassigned\
    \ numbers\n   should be provisioned to route to the provider's network in the\
    \ same\n   fashion as assigned numbers and only then provide an indication that\n\
    \   they are unassigned.  In that way, provider registration of a number\n   in\
    \ ENUM provides no more information about the status of a number\n   than could\
    \ be obtained by dialing it.\n   Implementers should take care to avoid inadvertent\
    \ disclosure of user\n   identities, for example, in the URIs returned in response\
    \ to\n   infrastructure ENUM queries.\n"
