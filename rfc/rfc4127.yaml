  - "1.  Introduction\n   [DSTE-REQ] presents the Service Providers requirements for\
    \ support of\n   Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE).  This includes\
    \ the\n   fundamental requirement to be able to enforce different Bandwidth\n\
    \   Constraints for different classes of traffic.\n   [DSTE-REQ] also defines\
    \ the concept of Bandwidth Constraints Model\n   for DS-TE and states that \"\
    The DS-TE technical solution MUST specify\n   at least one Bandwidth Constraints\
    \ Model and MAY specify multiple\n   Bandwidth Constraints Models\".\n   This\
    \ document provides a detailed description of one particular\n   Bandwidth Constraints\
    \ Model for DS-TE which is introduced in\n   [DSTE-REQ] and called the Russian\
    \ Dolls Model (RDM).\n   [DSTE-PROTO] specifies the Interior Gateway Protocol\
    \ (IGP) and RSVP-\n   TE signaling extensions for support of DS-TE.  These extensions\n\
    \   support RDM.\n"

  - "3.  Definitions\n   For readability a number of definitions from [DSTE-REQ] are\
    \ repeated\n   here:\n   Class-Type (CT): the set of Traffic Trunks crossing a\
    \ link that is\n                    governed by a specific set of bandwidth constraints.\n\
    \                    CT is used for the purposes of link bandwidth\n         \
    \           allocation, constraint-based routing and admission\n             \
    \       control.  A given Traffic Trunk belongs to the same\n                \
    \    CT on all links.\n   TE-Class:        A pair of:\n                    i.\
    \  a Class-Type\n                    ii. a preemption priority allowed for that\
    \ Class-\n                    Type.  This means that an LSP transporting a Traffic\n\
    \                    Trunk from that Class-Type can use that preemption\n    \
    \                priority as the setup priority, the holding\n               \
    \     priority, or both.\n   A number of recovery mechanisms under investigation\
    \ or specification\n   in the IETF take advantage of the concept of bandwidth\
    \ sharing across\n   particular sets of LSPs.  \"Shared Mesh Restoration\" in\
    \ [GMPLS-RECOV]\n   and \"Facility-based Computation Model\" in [MPLS-BACKUP]\
    \ are example\n   mechanisms that increase bandwidth efficiency by sharing bandwidth\n\
    \   across backup LSPs protecting against independent failures.  To\n   ensure\
    \ that the notion of \"Reserved (CTc)\" introduced in [DSTE-REQ]\n   is compatible\
    \ with such a concept of bandwidth sharing across\n   multiple LSPs, the wording\
    \ of the \"Reserved (CTc)\" definition\n   provided in [DSTE-REQ] is generalized\
    \ into the following:\n   Reserved (CTc):  For a given Class-Type CTc ( 0 <= c\
    \ <= MaxCT ), let\n                    us define \"Reserved(CTc)\" as the total\
    \ amount of the\n                    bandwidth reserved by all the established\
    \ LSPs which\n                    belong to CTc.\n   With this generalization,\
    \ the Russian Dolls Model definition provided\n   in this document is compatible\
    \ with Shared Mesh Restoration defined\n   in [GMPLS-RECOV], so that DS-TE and\
    \ Shared Mesh Protection can\n   operate simultaneously.  This assumes that Shared\
    \ Mesh Restoration\n   operates independently within each DS-TE Class-Type and\
    \ does not\n   operate across Class-Types (for example, backup LSPs protecting\n\
    \   Primary LSPs of CTx also need to belong to CTx; Excess Traffic LSPs\n   sharing\
    \ bandwidth with Backup LSPs of CTx also need to belong to\n   CTx).\n   We also\
    \ introduce the following definition:\n   Reserved(CTb,q): Let us define \"Reserved(CTb,q)\"\
    \ as the total amount\n                    of the bandwidth reserved by all the\
    \ established\n                    LSPs that belong to CTb and have a holding\
    \ priority\n                    of q.  Note that if q and CTb do not form one\
    \ of the\n                    8 possible configured TE-Classes, then there cannot\n\
    \                    be any established LSPs that belongs to CTb and has\n   \
    \                 a holding priority of q; therefore, in this case,\n        \
    \            Reserved(CTb,q) = 0.\n"

    \ Number of Class-Types (MaxCT) = 8\n        o for each value of b in the range\

    \ more\n   flexible/sophisticated Bandwidth Constraints models can be defined,\n\
    \   the Russian Dolls Model is attractive in some DS-TE environments for\n   the\
    \ following reasons:\n      - Although it is a little less intuitive than the\
    \ Maximum\n        Allocation Model (see [DSTE-MAM]), RDM is still a simple model\n\
    \        to conceptualize.\n      - RDM can be used simultaneously to ensure bandwidth\
    \ efficiency\n        and to protect against QoS degradation of all CTs, whether\n\
    \        preemption is used or not.\n      - RDM can be used in conjunction with\
    \ preemption to simultaneously\n        achieve (i) isolation across CTs (so that\
    \ each CT is guaranteed\n        its share of bandwidth no matter the level of\
    \ contention by\n        other classes), (ii) bandwidth efficiency, and (iii)\
    \ protection\n        against QoS degradation of all CTs.\n      - RDM only requires\
    \ limited protocol extensions such as the ones\n        defined in [DSTE-PROTO].\n\
    \   RDM may not be attractive in some DS-TE environments for the\n   following\
    \ reasons:\n      - if the usage of preemption is precluded for some administrative\n\
    \        reason, while RDM can still ensure bandwidth efficiency and\n       \
    \ protection against QoS degradation of all CTs, RDM cannot\n        guarantee\
    \ isolation across Class-Types.\n   Additional considerations on the properties\
    \ of RDM can be found in\n   [BC-CONS] and [BC-MODEL].\n   As a simple example\
    \ usage of the \"Russian Dolls\" Bandwidth\n   Constraints Model, a network administrator,\
    \ using one CT for Voice\n   (CT1) and one CT for data (CT0), might configure\
    \ on a given link:\n      - BC0 = Max-Reservable - Bw = 2.5 Gb/s (i.e., Voice\
    \ + Data is\n        limited to 2.5 Gb/s)\n      - BC1 = 1.5 Gb/s (i.e., Voice\
    \ is limited to 1.5 Gb/s).\n"

  - "5.  Example Formulas for Computing \"Unreserved TE-Class [i]\" with\n    Russian\
    \ Dolls Model\n   As specified in [DSTE-PROTO], formulas for computing \"Unreserved\
    \ TE-\n   Class [i]\" MUST reflect all of the Bandwidth Constraints relevant to\n\
    \   the CT associated with TE-Class[i], and thus, depend on the Bandwidth\n  \
    \ Constraints Model.  Thus, a DS-TE LSR implementing RDM MUST reflect\n   the\

    \   algorithms, as well as formulas for computing \"Unreserved TE-Class\n   [i]\"\
    , are outside the scope of the IETF work.  Keeping that in mind,\n   we provide\
    \ in this section an example for illustration purposes, of\n   how values for\
    \ the unreserved bandwidth for TE-Class[i] might be\n   computed with RDM.  In\
