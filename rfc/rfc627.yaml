  - "                      ASCII TEXT FILE OF HOSTNAMES\nThe online ASCII text file\
    \ of official hostnames as defined in RFCs 606\nand 608 is now available at OFFICE-1\
    \ (Hostaddr. 43 decimal) with\npathname <NETINFO>HOSTS.TXT.  Currently the file\
    \ includes hostname, host\naddress, and host status.  We hope to be adding additional\
    \ attributes\nsoon. This file will be maintained by the NIC, and all hosts are\n\
    encouraged to use these hostnames in their monitors.  Changes or\nadditions will\
    \ be added on a weekly basis.  Each network host will be\nresponsible for accessing\
    \ this file via FTP for new information.\nPresently no nicknames are included\
    \ in this file.  However, if any site\nwants to register one official nickname,\
    \ it may do so.  Nicknames will\nbe added to the <NETINFO>HOSTS.TXT file as they\
    \ are received, and\nsystems with name-to-address translation are encouraged,\
    \ but not\nrequired, to use them.\nAlthough hostname changes and nicknames are\
    \ perfectly valid in\nprinciple, as a practical consideration we would like to\
    \ ask hosts to\nchose their official hostnames carefully, so that changes and\
    \ nicknames\ncan be kept to a minimum.\nIf you have changes, additions, corrections,\
    \ or comments please direct\nthem to:\n    Jake Feinler                      \
