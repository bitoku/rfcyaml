- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA) provides\
    \ a\n   method to map a subset of names written in Unicode into the DNS.\n   Because\
    \ of Unicode decisions, appearance, language and writing system\n   conventions,\
    \ and historical reasons, it often has been asserted that\n   there is more than\
    \ one way to write what competent readers and\n   writers think of as the same\
    \ host name; these different ways of\n   writing are often called \"variants\"\
    .  (The authors note that there\n   are many conflicting definitions for the term\
    \ \"variant\" in the IDNA\n   community.)  This document surveys the approaches\
    \ that top-level\n   domains have taken to the registration and provisioning of\
    \ domain\n   names that have variants.  This document is not a product of the\n\
    \   IETF, does not propose any method to make variants work \"correctly\",\n \
    \  and is not an introduction to internationalization or IDNA.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA) [RFC5890]\n\
    \   allows host names in the DNS [RFC1035] to contain characters from the\n  \
    \ Unicode repertoire.  Some Unicode characters are considered to be\n   \"variants\"\
    \ of one another.  Because of the 20th century reform of\n   Chinese writing,\
    \ there is often more than one representation of what\n   Chinese speakers think\
    \ of as the same character.  Some languages\n   written in Latin characters with\
    \ accents and diacritical marks, known\n   as decorated characters, allow the\
    \ decorations to be omitted in some\n   situations; for example, French sometimes\
    \ omits accents on capital\n   letters, depending on country and culture.  Due\
    \ to the difficulty of\n   representing decorated characters in ASCII systems,\
    \ many users have\n   informally used undecorated characters in DNS host names,\
    \ even when\n   they are not linguistically equivalent to the decorated versions.\n\
    \   There is no single agreed-on definition of \"variant\".  In 2012, ICANN\n\
    \   said that variants \"occur when a single conceptual character can be\n   identified\
    \ with two or more different Unicode Code Points with\n   graphic representations\
    \ that may be visually similar\" (this\n   definition was previously available\
    \ at\n   http://www.icann.org/en/resources/idn/variant-tlds).  ICANN's IDN\n \
    \  Variant Issues Project report [VIPREPORT] says that \"[t]here is today\n  \
    \ no fully accepted definition for what may constitute a variant\n   relationship\
    \ between top-level labels\".  RFC 3743 [RFC3743] (an\n   Informational RFC, not\
    \ the product of the IETF) says that the idea of\n   variants is \"wherein one\
    \ conceptual character can be identified with\n   several different Code Points\
    \ in character sets for computer use\".\n   The proper handing of variant names\
    \ has been a topic of extensive\n   debate and research, with little consensus\
    \ reached on how to handle\n   them or even what characters are variants of each\
    \ other.  Many people\n   would like variant names to behave \"the same\", for\
    \ a diverse range of\n   meanings of \"same\".  In some cases, it is a textual\
    \ similarity, such\n   as variants having corresponding DNS records; in some,\
    \ it is\n   functional similarity, such as variant names resolving to the same\n\
    \   web server; while in others, it is user experience similarity, such\n   as\
    \ names resolving to web sites that, while not identical, are\n   perceived by\
    \ human users as equivalent.\n   This document provides a snapshot of variant\
    \ handling in the top-\n   level domains (TLDs) contracted by ICANN, so-called\
    \ gTLDs (generic\n   TLDs) and sTLDs (sponsored TLDs), as of late 2012.  We chose\
    \ those\n   domains because ICANN requires each TLD to describe its IDN and\n\
    \   variant practices, and the TLD zone files are available for\n   inspection,\
    \ to verify what actually goes into the zones.  This\n   document also contains\
    \ a small sampling of so-called ccTLDs (country\n   code TLDs, the TLDs that consist\
    \ of two ASCII letters) for which we\n   could find information.\n   Since \"\
    variant\" can mean vastly different things to different people,\n   there is also\
    \ no agreement about when two zones are supposed to\n   \"behave the same\". \
    \ Also, the gTLDs and sTLDs might have different\n   views of what variants are\
    \ and are not required to report to ICANN\n   about their policies.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   We use some terminology that has become generally agreed\
    \ to when\n   discussing variant names, although we openly admit that such\n \
    \  agreement is not complete and the terminology continues to change.\n   Bundle:\
    \  The IDN practices documents (see below) can identify sets of\n      code points\
    \ that are considered variants of each other using\n      Language Variant Tables,\
    \ defined in [RFC3743].  A set of names in\n      which the characters in each\
    \ position are variants is known as a\n      bundle or, more technically, as an\
    \ \"IDL Package\".  The variant\n      rules vary among languages, and for the\
    \ same language can vary\n      among TLDs.  Many languages do not define variant\
    \ characters and\n      hence do not have bundles.\n   Allocated:  A name is allocated\
    \ if sponsorship of that label in some\n      zone has been granted.  This is\
    \ similar to what many people refer\n      to as \"registered\".\n   Active: \
    \ A name is active if it appears as an owner name in a zone.\n      Most allocated\
    \ names are active, but some are not.\n   Blocked:  Some names cannot be registered\
    \ at all.  For example, some\n      registries allow one name in a bundle to be\
    \ registered and block\n      the rest.\n   Withheld:  Some names can only be\
    \ allocated under certain conditions.\n      For example, some registries permit\
    \ only the registrant of one\n      name in a bundle to register or activate other\
    \ names in the same\n      bundle.\n   Parallel NS:  Multiple names in a bundle\
    \ are provisioned in the TLD\n      with identical NS records, so they all are\
    \ handled by the same\n      name servers.\n   DNAME aliasing:  The DNAME [RFC6672]\
    \ DNS record creates a shadow tree\n      of DNS records, roughly as though there\
    \ were a CNAME in the shadow\n      tree pointing to each name in the target tree.\
    \  DNAMEs have been\n      used both to provide resolution for several names in\
    \ a bundle and\n      to provide resolution for every name under a TLD.\n"
- title: 3.  Base Documents
  contents:
  - "3.  Base Documents\n   ICANN has published a variety of documents on variant\
    \ management.\n   The most important are the \"Guidelines for the Implementation\
    \ of\n   Internationalized Domain Names\" issued in Version 1.0 [G1] and\n   Version\
    \ 3.0 [G3].\n   ICANN says that TLDs are supposed to register an IDN practices\n\
    \   document with IANA for each language and/or script in which the TLD\n   accepts\
    \ IDN registrations, to be entered in the IANA Repository of\n   IDN Practices\
    \ [IANAIDN].  The practices document lists the Unicode\n   characters allowed\
    \ in names in the language or script, which\n   characters are considered equivalent,\
    \ and which of an equivalent\n   group is preferred.  Some TLDs have been more\
    \ diligent than others at\n   keeping the registry up to date.  Also, some TLDs\
    \ have tables for a\n   few languages and scripts, while others (notably .COM,\
    \ .NET, and\n   .NAME) have a large set of tables, including some for languages\
    \ and\n   scripts that are no longer spoken or used, such as Runic and Ogham.\n\
    \   The authors also note that many of the tables in the IANA registry\n   are\
    \ clearly out of date, containing URLs of policy pages that no\n   longer exist\
    \ and contact information for people who have left the\n   registry.\n   Some\
    \ of the ICANN agreements with each TLD [ICANNAGREE] describe the\n   TLD's IDN\
    \ practices, but most don't.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.  ASIA\n   The .ASIA domain accepts registrations in many Asian languages.\
    \  They\n   have IANA tables for Japanese, Korean, and Chinese.  The IANA tables\n\
    \   refer to their CJK IDN policies [ASIACJK], which say that applied-for\n  \
    \ and preferred IDN variants are \"active and included in the zone\".  No\n  \
    \ IDN publication mechanism is described in the documentation, but\n   since the\
    \ zone file contains no DNAMEs, they must be using parallel\n   NS for variants.\n"
- title: 4.3.  BIZ
  contents:
  - "4.3.  BIZ\n   ICANN gave the registry (Neustar) non-specific permission to register\n\
    \   IDNs in a letter in 2004 [TWOMEY04A].  The IDN rules were apparently\n   discussed\
    \ with ICANN but not defined; see Appendix 9 of the registry\n   agreement [ICANNBIZ9].\n\
    \   They have about a dozen IANA tables.  No IDN publication mechanism is\n  \
    \ described, but from inspection, it appears that variants are blocked.\n"
- title: 4.4.  CAT
  contents:
  - "4.4.  CAT\n   The IDN rules are described in Appendix S, Part VII.2 [ICANNCATS]\
    \ of\n   the ICANN agreement.  \"Registry will take a very cautious approach in\n\
    \   its IDN offerings.  IDNs will be bundled with the equivalent ASCII\n   domains\"\
    .  The only language is Catalan.  No IDN publication\n   mechanism is described.\n\
    \   Appendix S includes \"The list of non-ASCII-characters for Catalan\n   language\
    \ and their ASCII equivalent for the purposes of the defined\n   service\", which\
    \ implicitly describes bundles.  The bundles consist of\n   names with accented\
    \ and unaccented vowels, U+00E7 (\"c with cedilla\")\n   and a plain c, and the\
    \ Catalan \"ela geminada\" written as two l's\n   separated by a U+00B7 (\"middle\
    \ dot\") and the three characters \"l-l\".\n   When a registrant registers an\
    \ IDN, the registry also includes the\n   ASCII version.  From inspection of the\
    \ zone file, the ASCII version\n   is provisioned with NS, and the IDN is a DNAME\
    \ alias of the ASCII\n   version.\n"

    \ a 2004\n   letter from Paul Twomey [TWOMEY04A] to Neustar, which did not mention\n\
    \   specific TLDs.  Its policy page [TELPOLICY] has links to IDN\n   practices\
    \ for 17 languages, all but one of which are registered with\n   IANA.  None of\
    \ the Latin scripts do bundling or blocking.  The\n   Japanese practices say that\
    \ variants are blocked.  The Chinese\n   practices document says:\n      Therefore,\
    \ in addition to the blocking mechanism, bundling is also\n      implemented for\
    \ the Chinese language IDNs.  When registering a\n      Chinese language IDN (primary\
    \ domain name) up to two additional\n      variant domain names will be automatically\
    \ registered.  The first\n      variant will consist entirely of simplified Chinese\
    \ characters\n      that correspond to those comprising the primary domain name.\
    \  The\n      second variant will consist exclusively of traditional Chinese\n\
    \      characters that correspond to those comprising the primary domain\n   \
    \   name.\n      The primary domain name together with the requested variants\n\
    \      constitutes a bundle on which all operations are atomic.  For\n      example,\
    \ if the registrant adds a name server to the primary\n      domain name, all\
    \ names in the bundle will be associated with that\n      new name server.\n \
    \  The zone has no DNAME records, so the second paragraph strongly\n   suggests\
    \ parallel NS.\n   The .TEL TLD, intended as an online directory, does not allow\n\
    \   registrants to enter arbitrary Resource Records (RRs) in the zone.\n   Nearly\
    \ all names have NS records pointing to Telnic's own name\n   servers.  The A\
    \ records all point to Telnic's own web server that\n   shows directory information.\
    \  NAPTR records provide telephone numbers\n   of registrants if available.  Users\
    \ can only directly provision MX\n   records.  Currently, there are 16 domains,\
    \ none of which are IDNs,\n   that point to random other name servers and mostly\
