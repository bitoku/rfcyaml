Abstract Bufferbloat is a phenomenon in which excess buffers in the network cause high latency and latency variation.
As more and more interactive applications (e.g., voice over IP, real time video streaming, and financial transactions) run in the Internet, high latency and latency variation degrade application performance.
There is a pressing need to design intelligent queue management schemes that can control latency and latency variation, and hence provide desirable quality of service to users.
This document presents a lightweight active queue management design called "PIE" (Proportional Integral controller Enhanced) that can effectively control the average queuing latency to a target value.
Simulation results, theoretical analysis, and Linux testbed results have shown that PIE can ensure low latency and achieve high link utilization under various congestion situations.
The design does not require per packet timestamps, so it incurs very little overhead and is simple enough to implement in both hardware and software.
The explosion of smart phones, tablets, and video traffic in the Internet brings about a unique set of challenges for congestion control.
To avoid packet drops, many service providers or data center operators require vendors to put in as much buffer as possible.
Because of the rapid decrease in memory chip prices, these requests are easily accommodated to keep customers happy.
While this solution succeeds in assuring low packet loss and high TCP throughput, it suffers from a major downside.
TCP continuously increases its sending rate and causes network buffers to fill up.
TCP cuts its rate only when it receives a packet drop or mark that is interpreted as a congestion signal.
However, drops and marks usually occur when network buffers are full or almost full.
As a result, excess buffers, initially designed to avoid packet drops, would lead to highly elevated queuing latency and latency variation.
Designing a queue management scheme is a delicate balancing act: it not only should allow short term bursts to smoothly pass but also should control the average latency in the presence of long running greedy flows.
Active Queue Management (AQM) schemes could potentially solve the aforementioned problem.
AQM schemes, such as Random Early Detection (RED) [RED] as suggested in [RFC2309] (which is now obsoleted by [RFC7567]), have been around for well over a decade.
RED is implemented in a wide variety of network devices, both in hardware and software.
Unfortunately, due to the fact that RED needs careful tuning of its parameters for various network conditions, most network operators don't turn RED on.
In addition, RED is designed to control the queue length, which would affect latency implicitly.
It does not control latency directly.
Hence, the Internet today still lacks an effective design that can control buffer latency to improve the quality of experience to latency sensitive applications.
The more recently published RFC 7567 calls for new methods of controlling network latency.
New algorithms are beginning to emerge to control queuing latency directly to address the bufferbloat problem [CoDel].
Along these lines, Proportional Integral controller Enhanced (PIE) also aims to keep the benefits of RED, including easy implementation and scalability to high speeds.
Similar to RED, PIE randomly drops an incoming packet at the onset of congestion.
Congestion detection, however, is based on the queuing latency instead of the queue length (as with RED).
Furthermore, PIE also uses the derivative (rate of change) of the queuing latency to help determine congestion levels and an appropriate response.
The design parameters of PIE are chosen via control theory stability analysis.
While these parameters can be fixed to work in various traffic conditions, they could be made self tuning to optimize system performance.
Separately, it is assumed that any latency based AQM scheme would be applied over a Fair Queuing (FQ) structure or one of its approximate designs, Flow Queuing or Class Based Queuing (CBQ).
FQ is one of the most studied scheduling algorithms since it was first proposed in 1985 [RFC970].
CBQ has been a standard feature in most network devices today [CBQ].
Any AQM scheme that is built on top of FQ or CBQ could benefit from these advantages.
Furthermore, these advantages, such as per flow or per class fairness, are orthogonal to the AQM design whose primary goal is to control latency for a given queue.
For flows that are classified into the same class and put into the same queue, one needs to ensure that their latency is better controlled and that their fairness is not worse than those under the standard DropTail or RED design.
More details about the relationship between FQ and AQM can be found in [RFC7806].
In October 2013, CableLabs' Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification 3.1 (DOCSIS 3.1) specification [DOCSIS 3.1] mandated that cable modems implement a specific variant of the PIE design as the active queue management algorithm.
In addition to cable specific improvements, the PIE design in DOCSIS 3.1 [RFC8034] has improved the original design in several areas, including derandomization of coin tosses and enhanced burst protection.
This document describes the design of PIE and separates it into basic elements and optional components that may be implemented to enhance the performance of PIE.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
A queue management framework is designed to improve the performance of interactive and latency sensitive applications.
It should follow the general guidelines set by the AQM working group document "IETF Recommendations Regarding Active Queue Management" [RFC7567].
More specifically, the PIE design has the following basic criteria.
First, queuing latency, instead of queue length, is controlled.
Queue sizes change with queue draining rates and various flows' round trip times.
Latency bloat is the real issue that needs to be addressed, as it impairs real time applications.
If latency can be controlled, bufferbloat is not an issue.
In fact, once latency is under control, it frees up buffers for sporadic bursts.
Secondly, PIE aims to attain high link utilization.
The goal of low latency shall be achieved without suffering link underutilization or losing network efficiency.
An early congestion signal could cause TCP to back off and avoid queue buildup.
On the other hand, however, TCP's rate reduction could result in link underutilization.
There is a delicate balance between achieving high link utilization and low latency.
Furthermore, the scheme should be simple to implement and easily scalable in both hardware and software.
PIE strives to maintain design simplicity similar to that of RED, which has been implemented in a wide variety of network devices.
Finally, the scheme should ensure system stability for various network topologies and scale well across an arbitrary number of streams.
Design parameters shall be set automatically.
Users only need to set performance related parameters such as target queue latency, not design parameters.
In the following text, the design of PIE and its operation are described in detail.
As illustrated in Figure 1, PIE is comprised of three simple basic components: a) random dropping at enqueuing, b) periodic drop probability updates, and c) latency calculation.
When a packet arrives, a random decision is made regarding whether to drop the packet.
The drop probability is updated periodically based on how far the current latency is away from the target value and whether the queuing latency is currently trending up or down.
The queuing latency can be obtained using direct measurements or using estimations calculated from the queue length and the dequeue rate.
The detailed definition of parameters can be found in Appendix A of this document ("The Basic PIE Pseudocode").
Any state variables that PIE maintains are noted using "PIE ".
For a full description of the algorithm, one can refer to the full paper [HPSR PIE].
Random Dropping PIE randomly drops a packet upon its arrival to a queue according to a drop probability, PIE drop prob , that is obtained from the drop probability calculation component.
The random drop is triggered by a packet's arrival before enqueuing into a queue.
Upon a packet enqueue: randomly drop the packet with a probability of PIE drop prob .
To ensure that PIE is "work conserving", we bypass the random drop if the latency sample, PIE qdelay old , is smaller than half of the target latency value (QDELAY REF) when the drop probability is not too high (i.e., PIE drop prob  < 0.2), or if the queue has less than a couple of packets.
Upon a packet enqueue, PIE does the following: //Safeguard
PIE to be work conserving
if ( (PIE qdelay old
< QDELAY REF/2 && PIE drop prob  < 0.2)
<  2   MEAN PKTSIZE) )
return ENQUE; else randomly drop the packet with a probability of PIE drop prob .
PIE optionally supports Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN); see Section 5.1.
The PIE algorithm periodically updates the drop probability based on the latency samples   not only the current latency sample but also whether the latency is trending up or down.
This is the classical Proportional Integral (PI) controller method, which is known for eliminating steady state errors.
This type of controller has been studied before for controlling the queue length [PI] [QCN].
PIE adopts the PI controller for controlling latency.
The algorithm also auto adjusts the control parameters based on how heavy the congestion is, which is reflected in the current drop probability.
Note that the current drop probability is a direct measure of the current congestion level
; there is no need to measure the arrival rate and dequeue rate mismatches.
When a congestion period ends, we might be left with a high drop probability with light packet arrivals.
Hence, the PIE algorithm includes a mechanism by which the drop probability decays exponentially (rather than linearly) when the system is not congested.
This would help the drop probability converge to 0 more quickly, while the PI controller ensures that it would eventually reach zero.
The decay parameter of 2% gives us a time constant around 50   T UPDATE.
Specifically, the PIE algorithm periodically adjusts the drop probability
beta   (current qdelay PIE qdelay old ); if (PIE drop prob  < 0.000001) { p /  2048; } else if (PIE drop prob  < 0.00001) { p /  512; } else if (PIE drop prob  < 0.0001) { p /  128; } else if (PIE drop prob  < 0.001) { p /  32; } else if (PIE drop prob  < 0.01) { p /  8
bound the drop probability: if (PIE drop prob  < 0)
if (PIE drop prob  > 1)
PIE drop prob    1.0    store the current latency value:
PIE qdelay old    current qdelay.
The update interval, T UPDATE, is defaulted to be 15 milliseconds.
It MAY be reduced on high speed links in order to provide smoother response.
The target latency value, QDELAY REF, SHOULD be set to 15 milliseconds.
The variables current qdelay and PIE qdelay old  represent the current and previous samples of the queuing latency, which are calculated by the "latency calculation" component (see Section 4.3).
The variable current qdelay is actually a temporary variable, while PIE qdelay old  is a state variable that PIE keeps.
The drop probability is a value between 0 and 1.
However, implementations can certainly use integers.
The controller parameters, alpha and beta (expressed in Hz), are designed using feedback loop analysis, where TCP's behaviors are modeled using the results from well studied prior art [TCP Models].
Note that the above adjustment of 'p' effectively scales the alpha and beta parameters based on the current congestion level indicated by the drop probability.
The theoretical analysis of PIE can be found in [HPSR PIE].
As a rule of thumb, to keep the same feedback loop dynamics, if we cut T UPDATE in half, we should also cut alpha by half and increase beta by alpha/4.
If the target latency is reduced, e.g., for data center use, the values of alpha and beta should be increased by the same order of magnitude by which the target latency is reduced.
For example, if QDELAY REF is reduced and changed from 15 milliseconds to 150 microseconds   a reduction of two orders of magnitude   then alpha and beta values should be increased to alpha   100 and beta
The PIE algorithm uses latency to calculate drop probability in one of two ways:
It estimates the current queuing latency using Little's law (see Section 5.2 for details):
Burst Tolerance PIE does not penalize short term packet bursts as suggested in [RFC7567].
PIE allows bursts of traffic that create finite duration events in which current queuing latency exceeds QDELAY REF without triggering packet drops.
This document introduces a parameter called "MAX BURST"; MAX BURST defines the burst duration that will be protected.
By default, the parameter SHOULD be set to 150 milliseconds.
For simplicity, the PIE algorithm MAY effectively round MAX BURST up to an integer multiple of T UPDATE.
To implement the burst tolerance function, two basic components of PIE are involved: "random dropping" and "drop probability calculation".
The PIE algorithm does the following:
In the "random dropping" block and upon packet arrival, PIE checks the following: Upon a packet enqueue:
> 0 enqueue packet; else randomly drop a packet with a probability of PIE drop prob .
if (PIE drop prob    0 and current qdelay < QDELAY REF/2 and PIE qdelay old  <
PIE burst allowance    MAX BURST;
In the "drop probability calculation" block, PIE additionally calculates:
; The burst allowance, noted by PIE burst allowance , is initialized to MAX BURST.
As long as PIE burst allowance  is above zero, an incoming packet will be enqueued, bypassing the random drop process.
During each update instance, the value of PIE burst allowance  is decremented by the update period, T UPDATE, and is bottomed at 0.
When the congestion goes away   defined here as PIE drop prob  equals 0 and both the current and previous samples of estimated latency are less than half of QDELAY REF   PIE
burst allowance  is reset to MAX BURST.
Optional Design Elements of PIE
There are several enhancements that are added to further augment the performance of the basic algorithm.
For purposes of clarity, they are included in this section.
ECN Support PIE MAY support ECN by marking (rather than dropping)
This document introduces an additional threshold called "mark ecnth", which acts as a safeguard: if the calculated drop probability exceeds mark ecnth, PIE reverts to packet dropping for ECN capable packets.
The variable mark ecnth SHOULD be set to 0.1 (10%).
Dequeue Rate Estimation Using timestamps, a latency sample can only be obtained when a packet reaches the head of a queue.
When a quick response time is desired or a direct latency sample is not available, one may obtain latency through measuring the dequeue rate.
The draining rate of a queue in the network often varies either because other queues are sharing the same link or because the link capacity fluctuates.
Rate fluctuation is particularly common in wireless networks.
One may measure directly at the dequeue operation.
Short, non persistent bursts of packets result in empty queues from time to time; this would make the measurement less accurate.
PIE only measures latency when there is sufficient data in the buffer, i.e., when the queue length is over a certain threshold (DQ THRESHOLD).
PIE measures how long it takes to drain DQ THRESHOLD packets.
More specifically, the rate estimation can be implemented as follows:
The parameter PIE dq count  represents the number of bytes departed since the last measurement.
Once PIE dq count  is over DQ THRESHOLD, a measurement sample is obtained.
It is recommended that the threshold be set to 16 KB, assuming a typical packet size of around 1 KB or 1.5 KB.
This threshold would allow sufficient data to obtain an average draining rate but would also be fast enough (< 64 KB) to reflect sudden changes in the draining rate.
If DQ THRESHOLD is smaller than 64 KB, a small weight is used to smooth out the dequeue time and obtain PIE avg dq time .
The dequeue rate is simply DQ THRESHOLD divided by PIE avg dq time .
This threshold is not crucial for the system's stability.
Please note that the update interval for calculating the drop probability is different from the rate measurement cycle.
The drop probability calculation is done periodically per Section 4.2, and it is done even when the algorithm is not in a measurement cycle; in this case, the previously latched value of PIE avg dq time  is used.
The Enqueue Based PIE Structure
In some platforms, enqueuing and dequeuing functions belong to different modules that are independent of each other.
In such situations, a pure enqueue based design can be developed.
An enqueue based design is depicted in Figure 2.
The dequeue rate is deduced from the number of packets enqueued and the queue length.
The design is based on the following key observation: over a certain time interval, the number of dequeued packets   the number of enqueued packets minus the number of remaining packets in the queue.
In this design, everything can be triggered by packet arrival, including the background update process.
The design complexity here is similar to the original design.
Setting PIE Active and Inactive Traffic naturally fluctuates in a network.
It would be preferable not to unnecessarily drop packets due to a spurious uptick in queuing latency.
PIE has an optional feature of automatically becoming active/inactive.
To implement this feature, PIE may choose to only become active (from inactive) when the buffer occupancy is over a certain threshold, which may be set to 1/3 of the tail drop threshold.
PIE becomes inactive when congestion ends; i.e., when the drop probability reaches 0, current and previous latency samples are all below half of QDELAY REF.
Ideally, PIE should become active/inactive based on latency.
However, calculating latency when PIE is inactive would introduce unnecessary packet processing overhead.
Weighing the trade offs, we decided to compare against the tail drop threshold to keep things simple.
PIE adds the following: Upon packet arrival: if PIE active    FALSE && queue length >
; PIE burst allowance    MAX BURST; if PIE burst allowance  > 0 enqueue packet; else randomly drop a packet with a probability of PIE drop prob .
if (PIE drop prob    0 and current qdelay < QDELAY REF/2 and PIE qdelay old  < QDELAY REF/2) PIE active    FALSE;
: PIE does the following: if PIE active    TRUE
burst allowance  T UPDATE); 5.4.
Although PIE adopts random dropping to achieve latency control, independent coin tosses could introduce outlier situations where packets are dropped too close to each other or too far from each other.
This would cause the real drop percentage to temporarily deviate from the intended value PIE drop prob .
In certain scenarios, such as a small number of simultaneous TCP flows, these deviations can cause significant deviations in link utilization and queuing latency.
PIE may use a derandomization mechanism to avoid such situations.
A parameter called "PIE accu prob " is reset to 0 after a drop.
Upon packet arrival, PIE accu prob  is incremented by the amount of drop probability, PIE drop prob .
If PIE accu prob  is less than a low threshold, e.g., 0.85, the arriving packet is enqueued; on the other hand, if PIE accu prob  is more than a high threshold, e.g., 8.5, and the queue is congested, the arrival packet is forced to be dropped.
A packet is only randomly dropped if PIE accu prob  falls between the two thresholds.
Since PIE accu prob  is reset to 0 after a drop, another drop will not happen until 0.85/PIE drop prob  packets later.
packets being dropped too close to each other.
In the other extreme case where 8.5/PIE drop prob  packets have been enqueued without incurring a drop, PIE would force a drop in order to prevent the drops from being spaced too far apart.
Further analysis can be found in [RFC8034].
In the case of a single TCP flow, during the slow start phase the queue could quickly increase, which could result in a very rapid increase in drop probability.
In order to prevent an excessive ramp up that could negatively impact the throughput in this scenario, PIE can cap the maximum drop probability increase in each step.
PIE adds the following: if (PIE drop prob
0.1 && p > 0.02)
{ p   0.02; } 6.
Implementation Cost PIE can be applied to existing hardware or software solutions.
There are three steps involved in PIE, as discussed in Section 4.
Their complexities are examined below.
Upon packet arrival, the algorithm simply drops a packet randomly, based on the drop probability.
This step is straightforward and requires no packet header examination and manipulation.
If the implementation doesn't rely on packet timestamps for calculating latency, PIE does not require extra memory.
Furthermore, the input side of a queue is typically under software control while the output side of a queue is hardware based.
Hence, a drop at enqueuing can be readily retrofitted into existing or software implementations.
The drop probability calculation is done in the background, and it occurs every T UPDATE interval.
Given modern high speed links, this period translates into once every tens, hundreds, or even thousands of packets.
Hence, the calculation occurs at a much slower time scale than the packet processing time   at least an order of magnitude slower.
The calculation of drop probability involves multiplications using alpha and beta.
Since PIE's control law is robust to minor changes in alpha and beta values, an implementation MAY choose these values to the closest multiples of 2 or 1/2 (e.g., alpha   1/8, beta   1   1/4) such that the multiplications can be done using simple adds and shifts.
As no complicated functions are required, PIE can be easily implemented in both hardware and software.
The state requirement is only three variables per queue: burst allowance , PIE drop prob , and PIE qdelay old .
Hence, the memory overhead is small.
If one chooses to implement the departure rate estimation, PIE uses a counter to keep track of the number of bytes departed for the current interval.
This counter is incremented per packet departure.
Every T UPDATE, PIE calculates latency using the departure rate, which can be implemented using a single multiply operation.
Note that many network devices keep track of an interface's departure rate.
In this case, PIE might be able to reuse this information and simply skip the third step of the algorithm; hence, it would incur no extra cost.
If a platform already leverages packet timestamps for other purposes, PIE can make use of these packet timestamps for latency calculation instead of estimating the departure rate.
Flow queuing can also be combined with PIE to provide isolation between flows.
In this case, it is preferable to have an independent value of drop probability per queue.
This allows each flow to receive the most appropriate level of congestion signal and ensures that sparse flows are protected from experiencing packet drops.
However, running the entire PIE algorithm independently on each queue in order to calculate the drop probability may be overkill.
Furthermore, in the case where departure rate estimation is used to predict queuing latency, it is not possible to calculate an accurate per queue departure rate upon which to implement the PIE drop probability calculation.
Instead, it has been proposed [DOCSIS AQM] that a single implementation of the PIE drop probability calculation based on the overall latency estimate be used, followed by a per queue scaling of drop probability based on the ratio of queue depth between the queue in question and the current largest queue.
This scaling is reasonably simple and has a couple of nice properties:
If a packet is arriving to an empty queue, it is given immunity from packet drops altogether, regardless of the state of the other queues.
In the situation where only a single queue is in use, the algorithm behaves exactly like the single queue PIE algorithm.
In summary, PIE is simple enough to be implemented in both software and hardware.
The design of the PIE algorithm is presented in this document.
The PIE algorithm effectively controls the average queuing latency to a target value.
The following areas can be used for further study and experimentation:
Autotuning of target latency without losing utilization.
Autotuning for the average round trip time of traffic.
The proper threshold to transition smoothly between ECN marking and dropping.
The enhancements described in Section 5, which can be used in experiments to see if they would be of more value in the real world.
If so, they will be incorporated into the basic PIE algorithm.
The PIE design, which is separated into the data path and the control path.
The control path can be implemented in software.
Field tests of other control laws can be performed to experiment with further improvements to PIE's performance.
Although all network nodes cannot be changed altogether to adopt latency based AQM schemes such as PIE, a gradual adoption would eventually lead to end to end low latency service for all applications.
Incremental Deployment From testbed experiments and large scale simulations of PIE
so far, PIE has been shown to be effective across a diverse range of network scenarios.
There is no indication that PIE would be harmful to deploy.
The PIE scheme can be independently deployed and managed without a need for interoperability between different network devices.
In addition, any individual buffer queue can be incrementally upgraded to PIE, as it can coexist with existing AQM schemes such as Weighted RED (WRED).
PIE is intended to be self configuring.
Users should not need to configure any design parameters.
Upon installation, the two user configurable parameters   QDELAY REF and MAX BURST   will be defaulted to 15 milliseconds and 150 milliseconds for non data center network devices and to 15 microseconds and 150 microseconds for data center switches, respectively.
Since the data path of the algorithm needs only a simple coin toss and the control path calculation happens in a much slower time scale, we don't foresee any scaling issues associated with the algorithm as the link speed scales up.
This document describes PIE, an active queue management algorithm based on implementations in different products.
