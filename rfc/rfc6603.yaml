  - "1.  Introduction\n   This specification defines an optional mechanism and the
    related\n   DHCPv6 option to allow exclusion of one specific prefix from a\n   delegated
    prefix set when using DHCPv6-based prefix delegation.\n   The prefix exclusion
    mechanism is targeted at deployments where\n   DHCPv6-based prefix delegation
    is used, but a single aggregated\n   route/prefix has to represent one customer,
    instead of using one\n   prefix for the link between the delegating router and
    the requesting\n   router and another prefix for the customer network.  The mechanism\n
    \  defined in this specification allows a delegating router to use a\n   prefix
    out of the delegated prefix set on the link through which it\n   exchanges DHCPv6
    messages with the requesting router, and is intended\n   for use in networks where
    each requesting router is on its own\n   layer-2 domain.\n"

  title: 2.  Requirements and Terminology
- contents:
  - "3.  Problem Background\n   DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (DHCPv6-PD) [RFC3633] has
    an explicit\n   limitation described in Section 12.1 of [RFC3633] that a prefix\n
    \  delegated to a requesting router cannot be used by the delegating\n   router.
    \ This restriction implies that the delegating router will\n   have two (non-aggregatable)
    routes towards a customer: one for the\n   link between the requesting router
    and the delegating router, and one\n   for the customer site behind the requesting
    router.\n   There are architectures and link models where a host (e.g., a mobile\n
    \  router, also acting as a requesting router) always has a single (/64)\n   prefix
    configured on its uplink interface and the delegating router\n   is also the requesting
    router's first-hop router.  Furthermore, it\n   may be required that the prefix
    configured on the uplink interface\n   has to be aggregatable with the delegated
    prefixes.  This introduces\n   a problem in how to use DHCPv6-PD together with
    stateless [RFC4862]\n   or stateful [RFC3315] address autoconfiguration on a link
    where the\n   /64 advertised is also part of the prefix delegated (e.g., /56)
    to\n   the requesting router.\n"

    '
  - contents:
    - "4.1.  Prefix Delegation with Excluded Prefixes\n   This specification defines
      a new DHCPv6 option, OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE\n   (67), that is used to exclude exactly
      one prefix from a delegated\n   prefix.  The OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE is included in
      the OPTION_IAPREFIX\n   IAprefix-options field.  There can be at most one OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE\n
      \  option in one OPTION_IAPREFIX option.  The OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option\n   allows
      prefix delegation where a requesting router is delegated a\n   prefix (e.g.,
      /56) and the delegating router uses one prefix (e.g.,\n   /64) on the link through
      which it exchanges DHCPv6 messages with the\n   requesting router with a prefix
      out of the same delegated prefix set.\n   A requesting router includes an OPTION_ORO
      option with the\n   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option code in a Solicit, Request, Renew,
      or Rebind\n   message to inform the delegating router about the support for
      the\n   prefix delegation functionality defined in this specification.  A\n
      \  delegating router may include the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option code in an\n   OPTION_ORO
      option in a Reconfigure message to indicate that the\n   requesting router should
      request OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE from the\n   delegating router.\n   The delegating
      router includes the prefix in the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE\n   option that is excluded
      from the delegated prefix set.  The\n   requesting router MUST NOT assign the
      excluded prefix to any of its\n   downstream interfaces.\n"

      = p>>120;\n       p <<= 8;\n     }\n   The OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option MUST only
      be included in the\n   OPTION_IAPREFIX IAprefix-options [RFC3633] field.\n   Any
      prefix excluded from the delegated prefix MUST be contained in\n   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE
      options within the corresponding OPTION_IAPREFIX.\n   The prefix included in
      the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option shares the same\n   preferred-lifetime and valid-lifetime
      as the delegated prefix in the\n   encapsulating OPTION_IAPREFIX option.\n   The
      prefix in the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option MUST be part of the\n   delegated prefix
      in the OPTION_IAPREFIX.  For example, the requesting\n   router has earlier
      been assigned a 2001:db8:dead:beef::/64 prefix by\n   the delegating router,
      and the delegated prefix in the\n   OPTION_IAPREFIX is 2001:db8:dead:bee0::/59.
      \ In this case, 2001:db8:\n   dead:beef::/64 is a valid prefix to be used in
      the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE\n   option.  The OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option would be encoded
      as follows:\n    0                   1                   2                   3\n
