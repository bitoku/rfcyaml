- title: 1.  The SNMP Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The SNMP Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently\
    \ consists of five major\n   components:\n      o  An overall architecture, described\
    \ in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].\n      o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects\
    \ and events for the\n         purpose of management.  The first version of this\
    \ Structure of\n         Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described\
    \ in\n         STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC\n\
    \         1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described\n  \
    \       in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and\n      \
    \   STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].\n      o  Message protocols for transferring management\
    \ information.  The\n         first version of the SNMP message protocol is called\
    \ SNMPv1 and\n         described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version\
    \ of\n         the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards\n\
    \         track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901\n      \
    \   [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the\n         message\
    \ protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906\n         [RFC1906], RFC\
    \ 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].\n      o  Protocol operations for accessing\
    \ management information.  The\n         first set of protocol operations and\
    \ associated PDU formats is\n         described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].\
    \  A second set of\n         protocol operations and associated PDU formats is\
    \ described in\n         RFC 1905 [RFC1905].\n      o  A set of fundamental applications\
    \ described in RFC 2573\n         [RFC2573] and the view-based access control\
    \ mechanism described\n         in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].\n   A more detailed introduction\
    \ to the current SNMP Management Framework\n   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].\n\
    \   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the\
    \ Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n   defined using\
    \ the mechanisms defined in the SMI.\n   This memo specifies a MIB module that\
    \ is compliant to the SMIv2.  A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced\
    \ through the appropriate\n   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must\
    \ be semantically\n   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because\
    \ no\n   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable\n\
    \   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in\n   SMIv1\
    \ during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine\n   readable\
    \ information is not considered to change the semantics of the\n   MIB.\n"
- title: 2.  Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  Overview\n   Systems that support SNMP often need a mechanism for recording\n\
    \   Notification information as a hedge against lost Notifications,\n   whether\
    \ those are Traps or Informs [RFC1905] that exceed\n   retransmission limits.\
    \  This MIB therefore provides common\n   infrastructure for other MIBs in the\
    \ form of a local logging\n   function.  It is intended primarily for senders\
    \ of Notifications but\n   could be used also by receivers.\n   Given the Notification\
    \ Log MIB, individual MIBs bear less\n   responsibility to record the transient\
    \ information associated with an\n   event against the possibility that the Notification\
    \ message is lost,\n   and applications can poll the log to verify that they have\
    \ not missed\n   important Notifications.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Environment
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Environment\n   The overall environmental concerns for the MIB are:\n \
    \     o  SNMP Engines and Contexts\n      o  Security\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  SNMP Engines and Contexts
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  SNMP Engines and Contexts\n   There are two distinct information flows\
    \ from multiple notification\n   originators that one may log.  The first is the\
    \ notifications that\n   are received (from one or more SNMP engines) for logging\
    \ as SNMP\n   informs and traps.  The other comprises notifications delivered\
    \ to an\n   SNMP engine at the interface to the notification originator (using\
    \ a\n   notification mechanism other than SNMP informs or traps).  The latter\n\
    \   information flow (using a notification mechanism other than SNMP\n   informs\
    \ or traps) is modeled here as the SNMP engine (which maintains\n   the log) sending\
    \ a notification to itself.  The remainder of this\n   section discusses the handling\
    \ of the former information flow -\n   notifications (received in the form of\
    \ SNMP informs or traps) from\n   multiple SNMP engines.\n   As described in the\
    \ SNMP architecture [RFC2571], a given system may\n   support multiple SNMP engines\
    \ operating independently of one another,\n   each with its own SNMP engine identification.\
    \  Furthermore, within\n   the purview of a given engine there may be multiple\
    \ named management\n   contexts supporting overlapping or disjoint sets of MIB\
    \ objects and\n   Notifications.  Thus, understanding a particular Notification\n\
    \   requires knowing the SNMP engine and management context from whence\n   it\
    \ came.\n   To provide the necessary source information for a logged\n   Notification,\
    \ the MIB includes objects to record that Notification's\n   source SNMP engine\
    \ ID and management context name.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  Security
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Security\n   Security for Notifications is awkward since access control\
    \ for the\n   objects in the Notification can be checked only where the\n   Notification\
    \ is created.  Thus such checking is possible only for\n   locally-generated Notifications,\
    \ and even then only when security\n   credentials are available.\n   For the\
    \ purpose of this discussion, \"security credentials\" means the\n   input values\
    \ for the abstract service interface function\n   isAccessAllowed [RFC2571] and\
    \ using those credentials means\n   conceptually using that function to see that\
    \ those credentials allow\n   access to the MIB objects in question, operating\
    \ as for a\n   Notification Originator in [RFC2573].\n   The Notification Log\
    \ MIB has the notion of a \"named log.\"  By using\n   log names and view-based\
    \ access control [RFC2575] a network\n   administrator can provide different access\
    \ for different users.  When\n   an application creates a named log the security\
    \ credentials of the\n   creator stay associated with that log.\n   A managed\
    \ system with fewer resources MAY disallow the creation of\n   named logs, providing\
    \ only the default, null-named log.  Such a log\n   has no implicit security credentials\
    \ for Notification object access\n   control and Notifications are put into it\
    \ with no further checking.\n   When putting locally-generated Notifications into\
    \ a named log, the\n   managed system MUST use the security credentials associated\
    \ with that\n   log and MUST apply the same access control rules as described\
    \ for a\n   Notification Originator in [RFC2573].\n   The managed system SHOULD\
    \ NOT apply access control when adding\n   remotely-generated Notifications into\
    \ either a named log or the\n   default, null-named log.  In those cases the security\
    \ of the\n   information in the log SHOULD be left to the normal, overall access\n\
    \   control for the log itself.\n   The Notification Log MIB allows applications\
    \ to set the maximum\n   number of Notifications that can be logged, using\n \
    \  nlmConfigGlobalEntryLimit.  Similarly, an application can set the\n   maximum\
    \ age using nlmConfigGlobalAgeOut, after which older\n   Notifications MAY be\
    \ timed out.  Please be aware that contention\n   between multiple applications\
    \ trying to set these objects to\n   different values MAY affect the reliability\
    \ and completeness of data\n   seen by each application, i.e., it is possible\
    \ that one application\n   may change the value of either of these objects, resulting\
    \ in some\n   Notifications being deleted before the other applications have had\
    \ a\n   chance to see them.  This could be used to orchestrate a denial-of-\n\
    \   service attack.  Methods for countering such an attack are for\n   further\
    \ study.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Structure
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Structure\n   The MIB has the following sections:\n      o  Configuration\
    \ -- control over how much the log can hold and\n         what Notifications are\
    \ to be logged.\n      o  Statistics -- indications of logging activity.\n   \
    \   o  Log -- the Notifications themselves.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.  Configuration
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Configuration\n   The configuration section contains objects to manage\
    \ resource use by\n   the MIB.\n   This section also contains a table to specify\
    \ what logs exist and how\n   they operate.  Deciding which Notifications are\
    \ to be logged depends\n   on filters defined in the the snmpNotifyFilterTable\
    \ in the standard\n   SNMP Notification MIB [RFC2573] identified by the initial\
    \ index\n   (snmpNotifyFilterName) from that table.\n"
- title: 2.2.2.  Statistics
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  Statistics\n   The statistics section contains counters for Notifications\
    \ logged and\n   discarded, supplying a means to understand the results of log\n\
    \   capacity configuration and resource problems.\n"
- title: 2.2.3.  Log
  contents:
  - "2.2.3.  Log\n   The log contains the Notifications and the objects that came\
    \ in their\n   variable binding list, indexed by an integer that reflects when\
    \ the\n   entry was made.  An application that wants to collect all logged\n \
    \  Notifications or to know if it may have missed any can keep track of\n   the\
    \ highest index it has retrieved and start from there on its next\n   poll, checking\
    \ sysUpTime for a discontinuity that would have reset\n   the index and perhaps\
    \ have lost entries.\n   Variables are in a table indexed by Notification index\
    \ and variable\n   index within that Notification.  The values are kept as a\n\
    \   \"discriminated union,\" with one value object per variable.  Exactly\n  \
    \ which value object is instantiated depends on the SNMP data type of\n   the\
    \ variable, with a separate object of appropriate type for each\n   distinct SNMP\
    \ data type.\n   An application can thus reconstruct the information from the\n\
    \   Notification PDU from what is recorded in the log.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.3.  Example\n   Following is an example configuration of a named log for logging\
