  - "1 Abstract\n   IP unicast address allocation and management are essential\n \
    \  operational functions for the Public Internet. The exact policies for\n   IP\
    \ unicast address allocation and management continue to be the\n   subject of\
    \ many discussions. Such discussions cannot be pursued in a\n   vacuum - the participants\
    \ must understand the technical issues and\n   implications associated with various\
    \ address allocation and\n   management policies.\n   The purpose of this document\
    \ is to articulate certain relevant\n   fundamental technical issues that must\
    \ be considered in formulating\n   unicast address allocation and management policies\
    \ for the Public\n   Internet, and to provide recommendations with respect to\
    \ these\n   policies.\n   The major focus of this document is on two possible\
    \ policies,\n   \"address ownership\" and \"address lending,\" and the technical\n\
    \   implications of these policies for the Public Internet.  For the\n   organizations\
    \ that could provide reachability to a sufficiently large\n   fraction of the\
    \ total destinations in the Internet, and could express\n   such reachability\
    \ through a single IP address prefix the document\n   suggests to use the \"address\
    \ ownership\" policy. However, applying the\n   \"address ownership\" policy to\
    \ every individual site or organization\n   that connects to the Internet results\
    \ in a non-scalable routing.\n   Consequently, this document also recomments that\
    \ the \"address\n   lending\" policy should be formally added to the set of address\n\
    \   allocation policies in the Public Internet. The document also\n   recommends\
    \ that organizations that do not provide a sufficient degree\n   of routing information\
    \ aggregation, but wish to obtain access to the\n   Internet routing services\
    \ should be strongly encouraged to use this\n   policy to gain access to the services.\n"
- title: 2 On the intrinsic value of IP addresses
  contents:
  - "2 On the intrinsic value of IP addresses\n   Syntactically, the set of IPv4 unicast\
    \ addresses is the (finite) set\n   of integers in the range 0x00000000 - 0xDFFFFFFF.\
    \ IP addresses are\n   used for Network Layer (IP) routing. An IP address is the\
    \ sole piece\n   of information about the node injected into the routing system.\n\
    \   The notable semantics of an IP unicast address is its ability to\n   interact\
    \ with the Public Internet routing service and thereby\n   exchange data with\
    \ the remainder of the Internet. In other words, for\n   the Public Internet,\
    \ it is the reachability of an IP address that\n   gives it an intrinsic value.\
    \ Observe, however, that IP addresses are\n   used outside of the Public Internet.\
    \ This document does not cover the\n   value of addresses in other than the Public\
    \ Internet context.\n   The above implies that in the Public Internet it is the\
    \ service\n   environment (the Internet) and its continued operation, including\
    \ its\n   routing system, which gives an IP address its intrinsic value, rather\n\
    \   than the inverse. Consequently, if the Public Internet routing system\n  \
    \ ceases to be operational, the service disappears, and the addresses\n   cease\
    \ to have any functional value in the Internet. At this point,\n   for the Public\
    \ Internet, all address allocation and management\n   policies, including existing\
    \ policies, are rendered meaningless.\n"
- title: 3 Hierarchical routing and its implication on address allocation
  contents:
  - "3 Hierarchical routing and its implication on address allocation\n   Hierarchical\
    \ routing [Kleinrock 77] is a mechanism that improves the\n   scaling properties\
    \ of a routing system. It is the only proven\n   mechanism for scaling routing\
    \ to the current size of the Internet.\n   Hierarchical routing requires that\
    \ addresses be assigned to reflect\n   the actual network topology. Hierarchical\
    \ routing works by taking the\n   set of addresses covered by a portion of the\
    \ topology, and generating\n   a single routing advertisement (route) for the\
    \ entire set. Further,\n   hierarchical routing allows this to be done recursively:\
    \ multiple\n   advertisements (routes) can be combined into a single advertisement\n\
    \   (route). By exercising this recursion, the amount of information\n   necessary\
    \ to provide routing can be decreased substantially.\n   A common example of hierarchical\
    \ routing is the phone network, where\n   country codes, area codes, exchanges,\
    \ and finally subscriber lines\n   are different levels in the hierarchy. In the\
    \ phone network, a switch\n   need not keep detailed routing information about\
    \ every possible\n   subscriber in a distant area code. Instead, the switch usually\
    \ knows\n   one routing entry for the entire area code.\n   Notice that the effect\
    \ on scaling is dramatic. If we look at the\n   space complexity of the different\
    \ schemes, the switch that knows\n   about every subscriber in the world needs\
    \ O(n) space for n worldwide\n   subscribers.  Now consider the case of hierarchical\
    \ routing. We can\n   break n down into the number of subscribers in the local\
    \ area (l),\n   the other exchanges in the area code (e), the other area codes\
    \ in the\n   local country code (a) and other country codes (c). Using this\n\
    \   notation, hierarchical routing has space complexity O(l + e + a + c).\n  \
    \ Notice that each of these factors is much, much less than n, and\n   grows very\
    \ slowly, if at all. This implies that a phone switch can be\n   built today that\
    \ has some hope of not running out of space when it is\n   deployed.\n   The fundamental\
    \ property of hierarchical routing that makes this\n   scalability possible is\
    \ the ability to form abstractions: here, the\n   ability to group subscribers\
    \ into exchanges, area codes and country\n   codes. Further, such abstractions\
    \ must provide useful information for\n   the ability to do routing. Some abstractions,\
    \ such as the group of\n   users with green phones, are not useful when it comes\
    \ time to route a\n   call.\n   Since the information that the routing system\
    \ really needs is the\n   location of the address within the topology, for hierarchical\n\
    \   routing, the useful abstraction must capture the topological location\n  \
    \ of an address within the network. In principle this could be\n   accomplished\
    \ in one of two ways.  Either (a) constrain the topology\n   (and allowed topology\
    \ changes) to match address assignment. Or, (b)\n   avoid constraints on the topology\
    \ (and topology changes), but require\n   that as the topology changes, an entity's\
    \ address change as well. The\n   process of changing an entity's address is known\
    \ as \"renumbering.\"\n"
- title: 4 Scaling the Internet routing system
  contents:
  - "4 Scaling the Internet routing system\n   The enormous growth of the Public Internet\
    \ places a heavy load on the\n   Internet routing system. Before the introduction\
    \ of CIDR the growth\n   rate had doubled the size of the routing table roughly\
    \ every nine\n   months. Capacity of computer technology doubles roughly every\
    \ 24\n   months. Even if we could double the capacities of the routers in the\n\
    \   Internet every 24 months, inevitably the size of the routing tables\n   is\
    \ going to exceed the limit of the routers. Therefore, to preserve\n   uninterrupted\
    \ continuous growth of the Public Internet, deploying\n   mechanisms that contain\
    \ the growth rate of the routing information is\n   essential.\n   Lacking mechanisms\
    \ to contain the growth rate of the routing\n   information, the growth of the\
    \ Internet would have to be either\n   limited or frozen, or the Internet routing\
    \ system would become\n   overloaded. The result of overloading routing is that\
    \ the routing\n   subsystem will fail: either equipment (routers) could not maintain\n\
    \   enough routes to insure global connectivity, or providers will simply\n  \
    \ exclude certain routes to insure that other routes provide\n   connectivity\
    \ to particular sites. This document assumes that neither\n   of the outcomes\
    \ mentioned in this paragraph is acceptable.\n   Classless Inter-Domain Routing\
    \ (CIDR) [RFC1518, RFC1519] has been\n   deployed since late 1992 in the Public\
    \ Internet as the primary\n   mechanism to contain the growth rate of the routing\
    \ information -\n   without CIDR the Internet routing system would have already\n\
    \   collapsed. For example, in October 1995, within AlterNet (one of the\n   major\
    \ Internet Service Providers) there were 3194 routes. Thanks to\n   aggregation,\
    \ AlterNet advertised only 799 routes to the rest of the\n   Internet - a saving\
    \ of 2395 routes (75%) [Partan 95]. In October 1995\n   the Internet Routing Registry\
    \ (IRR) contained 61,430 unique prefixes\n   listed, not counting prefixes marked\
    \ as withdrawn (or 65,191 prefixes\n   with prefixes marked as withdrawn). That\
    \ is roughly a lower bound\n   since many prefixes are not registered in the IRR.\
    \ CIDR aggregation\n   resulted in less than 30,000 routes in the default-free\
    \ part of the\n   Internet routing system [Villamizar 95].\n   CIDR is an example\
    \ of the application of hierarchical routing in the\n   Public Internet, where\
    \ subnets, subscribers, and finally providers\n   are some possible levels in\
    \ the hierarchy. For example, a router\n   within a site need not keep detailed\
    \ routing information about every\n   possible host in that site. Instead, the\
    \ router maintains routing\n   information on a per subnet basis. Likewise, a\
    \ router within a\n   provider need not keep detailed routing information about\
    \ individual\n   subnets within its subscribers. Instead, the router could maintain\n\
    \   routing information on a per subscriber basis. Moreover, a router\n   within\
    \ a provider need not keep detailed routing information about\n   stub (single\
    \ home) subscribers of other providers by maintaining\n   routing information\
    \ on a per provider basis.\n   Because of pre-CIDR address allocation, many routes\
    \ in the Internet\n   are not suitable for hierarchical aggregation. Moreover,\
    \ unconnected\n   sites with pre-CIDR address allocations exist. If these sites\
    \ connect\n   to the Internet at some point in the future, the routes to these\n\
    \   sites are unlikely to be suitable for hierarchical aggregation. Also,\n  \
    \ when a site uses addresses obtain from its provider, but then later\n   switches\
    \ to a different provider (while continuing to use the same\n   addresses), the\
    \ route to the site may no longer be suitable for\n   hierarchical aggregation.\n\
    \   Hierarchical routing requires that aggregation boundaries for the\n   addressing\
    \ information be formed along some hierarchy. As a result,\n   many exceptions\
    \ will be injected into the routing system in the\n   future, besides those exceptions\
    \ that currently exist. Each exception\n   added to the routing system deters\
    \ the scalability of the routing\n   system. The exact number of exceptions that\
    \ can be tolerated is\n   dependent on the technology used to support routing.\
    \ Unbridled growth\n   in the number of such exceptions will cause the routing\
    \ system to\n   collapse.\n"

- title: 5.1 The "address ownership" allocation policy and its implications on
  contents:
  - "5.1 The \"address ownership\" allocation policy and its implications on\n   the\
    \ Public Internet\n   \"Address ownership\" is one possible address allocation\
    \ and management\n   policy. The \"address ownership\" policy means that part\
    \ of the address\n   space, once allocated to an organization, remains allocated\
    \ to the\n   organization as long as that organization wants it. Further, that\n\
    \   portion of the address space would not be allocated to any other\n   organization.\
    \  Often, such addresses are called \"portable.\" It was\n   assumed that if an\
    \ organization acquires its addresses via the\n   \"address ownership\" policy,\
    \ the organization would be able to use\n   these addresses to gain access to\
    \ the Internet routing services,\n   regardless of where the organization connects\
    \ to the Internet.\n   While it has never been explicitly stated that various\
    \ Internet\n   Registries use the \"address ownership\" allocation policy, it\
    \ has\n   always been assumed (and practiced).\n   To understand the implications\
    \ of the \"address ownership\" policy\n   (\"portable\" addresses) on the scalability\
    \ of the Internet routing\n   system, one must observe that:\n     (a) By definition,\
    \ address ownership assumes that addresses, once\n     assigned, fall under the\
    \ control of the assignee. It is the\n     assignee that decides when to relinquish\
    \ the ownership (although\n     the decision could be influenced by various factors).\n\
    \     Specifically, the assignee is not required (but may be influenced)\n   \
    \  to relinquish the ownership as the connectivity of the assignee to\n     the\
    \ Internet changes.\n     (b) By definition, hierarchical routing assumes that\
    \ addresses\n     reflect the network topology as much as possible.\n   Therefore,\
    \ the only presently known practical way to satisfy both\n   scalable hierarchical\
    \ routing and address ownership for everyone is\n   to assume that the topology\
    \ (or at least certain pieces of it) will\n   be permanently fixed. Given the\
    \ distributed, decentralized, largely\n   unregulated, and global (international)\
    \ nature of the Internet,\n   constraining the Internet topology (or even certain\
    \ parts of it) may\n   have broad technical, social, economical, and political\
    \ implications.\n   To date, little is known of what these implications are; even\
    \ less is\n   known whether these implications would be acceptable (feasible)\
    \ in\n   practice. Therefore, at least for now, we have to support an Internet\n\
    \   with an unconstrained topology (and unconstrained topological\n   changes).\n\
    \   Since the Internet does not constrain its topology (or allowed\n   topology\
    \ changes), we can either have address ownership for everyone\n   or a routable\
    \ Internet, but not both, or we need to develop and\n   deploy new mechanisms\
    \ (e.g., by decoupling the address owned by the\n   end users from those used\
    \ by the Internet routing, and provide\n   mechanisms to translate between the\
    \ two). In the absence of new\n   mechanisms, if we have address ownership (\"\
    portable\" addresses) for\n   everyone, then the routing overhead will lead to\
    \ a breakdown of the\n   routing system resulting in a fragmented (partitioned)\
    \ Internet.\n   Alternately, we can have a routable Internet, but without address\n\
    \    ownership (\"portable\" addresses) for everyone.\n"
- title: 5.2 The "address lending" allocation policy and its implications for the
  contents:
  - "5.2 The \"address lending\" allocation policy and its implications for the\n\
    \   Public Internet\n   Recently, especially since the arrival of CIDR, some subscribers\
    \ and\n   providers have followed a model in which address space is not owned\n\
    \   (not portable), but is bound to the topology. This model suggests an\n   address\
    \ allocation and management policy that differs from the\n   \"address ownership\"\
    \ policy. The following describes a policy, called\n   \"address lending,\" that\
    \ provides a better match (as compared to the\n   \"address ownership\" policy)\
    \ to the model.\n   An \"address lending\" policy means that an organization gets\
    \ its\n   addresses on a \"loan\" basis. For the length of the loan, the lender\n\
    \   cannot lend the addresses to any other borrower. Assignments and\n   allocations\
    \ based on the \"address lending\" policy should explicitly\n   include the conditions\
    \ of the loan. Such conditions must specify that\n   allocations are returned\
    \ if the borrower is no longer contractually\n   bound to the lender, and the\
    \ lender can no longer provide aggregation\n   for the allocation. If a loan ends,\
    \ the organization can no longer\n   use the borrowed addresses, and therefore\
    \ must get new addresses and\n   renumber to use them. The \"address lending\"\
    \ policy does not constrain\n   how the new addresses could be acquired.\n   This\
    \ document expects that the \"address lending\" policy would be used\n   primarily\
    \ by Internet Registries associated with providers; however,\n   this document\
    \ does not preclude the use of the \"address lending\"\n   policy by an Internet\
    \ Registry that is not associated with a\n   provider.\n   This document expects\
    \ that when the \"address lending\" policy is used\n   by an Internet Registry\
    \ associated with a provider, the provider is\n   responsible for arranging aggregation\
    \ of these addresses to a degree\n   that is sufficient to achieve Internet-wide\
    \ IP connectivity.\n   This document expects that when the \"address lending\"\
    \ policy is used\n   by an Internet Registry associated with a provider, the terms\
    \ and\n   conditions of the loan would be coupled to the service agreement\n \
    \  between the provider and the subscribers. That is, if the subscriber\n   moves\
    \ to another provider, the loan would be canceled.\n   To reduce disruptions when\
    \ a subscriber changes its providers, this\n   document strongly recommends that\
    \ the terms and conditions of the\n   loan should include provision for a grace\
    \ period. This provision\n   would allow a subscriber that disconnects from its\
    \ provider a certain\n   grace period after the disconnection. During this grace\
    \ period, the\n   borrower (the subscriber) may continue to use the addresses\
    \ obtained\n   under the loan. This document recommends a grace period of at least\n\
    \   30 days. Further, to contain the routing information overhead, this\n   document\
    \ suggests that a grace period be no longer than six months.\n   To understand\
    \ the scalability implications of the \"address lending\"\n   policy, observe\
    \ that if a subscriber borrows its addresses from its\n   provider's block, then\
    \ the provider can advertise a single address\n   prefix. This reduces the routing\
    \ information that needs to be carried\n   by the Internet routing system (for\
    \ more information, see Section\n   5.3.1 of RFC1518). As the subscriber changes\
    \ its provider, the loan\n   from the old provider would be returned, and the\
    \ loan from the new\n   provider would be established. As a result, the subscriber\
    \ would\n   renumber to the new addresses. Once the subscriber renumbers into\
    \ the\n   new provider's existing blocks, no new routes need to be introduced\n\
    \   into the routing system.\n   Therefore, the \"address lending\" policy, if\
    \ applied appropriately, is\n   consistent with the constraints on address allocation\
    \ policies\n   imposed by hierarchical routing, and thus promotes a scalable routing\n\
    \   system.  Thus, the \"address lending\" policy, if applied\n   appropriately,\
    \ could play an important role in enabling the\n   continuous uninterrupted growth\
    \ of the Internet.\n   To be able to scale routing in other parts of the hierarchy,\
    \ the\n   \"lending\" policy may also be applied hierarchically, so that\n   addresses\
    \ may in turn be lent to other organizations. The implication\n   here is that\
    \ the end of a single loan may have effects on\n   organizations that have recursively\
    \ borrowed parts of the address\n   space from the main allocation. In this case,\
    \ the exact effects are\n   difficult to determine a priori.\n"
- title: 5.3 In the absence of an explicit "address lending" policy
  contents:
  - "5.3 In the absence of an explicit \"address lending\" policy\n   Organizations\
    \ connecting to the Internet should be aware that even if\n   their current provider,\
    \ and the provider they switch to in the future\n   do not require renumbering,\
    \ renumbering may still be needed to\n   achieve Internet-wide IP connectivity.\
    \ For example, an organization\n   may now receive Internet service from some\
    \ provider and allocate its\n   addresses out of the CIDR block associated with\
    \ the provider. Later\n   the organization may switch to another provider. The\

    \ be willing to accept that organization without\n   renumbering and advertise\

    \   be either to renumber, or for others to acquire connectivity to\n   providers\
    \ that are willing and able to accept the prefix.\n   The above shows that the\
    \ absence of an explicit \"address lending\"\n   policy from a current provider\
    \ in no way ensures that renumbering\n   will not be required in the future when\
    \ changing providers.\n   Organizations should be aware of this fact should they\
    \ encounter a\n   provider making claims to the contrary.\n"
- title: 6 Recommendations
  contents:
  - "6 Recommendations\n   Observe that the goal of hierarchical routing in the Internet\
    \ is not\n   to reduce the total amount of routing information in the Internet\
    \ to\n   the theoretically possible minimum, but just to contain the volume of\n\
    \   routing information within the limits of technology,\n   price/performance,\
    \ and human factors.  Therefore, organizations that\n   could provide reachability\
    \ to a sufficiently large fraction of the\n   total destinations in the Internet\
    \ and could express such\n   reachability through a single IP address prefix could\
    \ expect that a\n   route with this prefix will be maintained throughout the default-free\n\
    \   part of the Internet routing system, regardless of where they connect\n  \
    \ to the Internet.  Therefore, using the \"address ownership\" policy\n   when\
    \ allocating addresses to such organizations is a reasonable\n   choice.  Within\
    \ such organizations this document suggests the use of\n   the \"address lending\"\
    \ policy.\n   For all other organizations that expect Internet-wide IP\n   connectivity,\
    \ the reachability information they inject into the\n   Internet routing system\
    \ should be subject to hierarchical\n   aggregation. For such organizations, allocating\
    \ addresses based on\n   the \"address ownership\" policy makes hierarchical aggregation\n\
    \   difficult, if not impossible. This, in turn, has a very detrimental\n   effect\
    \ on the Internet routing system. To prevent the collapse of the\n   Internet\
    \ routing system, for such organizations, this document\n   recommends using the\
    \ \"address lending\" policy. Consequently, when\n   such an organization first\
    \ connects to the Public Internet or changes\n   its topological attachment to\
    \ the Public Internet, the organization\n   eventually needs to renumber. Renumbering\
    \ allows the organization to\n   withdraw any exceptional prefixes that the organization\
    \ would\n   otherwise inject into the Internet routing system. This applies to\n\
    \   the case where the organization takes its addresses out of its direct\n  \
    \ provider's block and the organization changes its direct provider.\n   This\
    \ may also apply to the case where the organization takes its\n   addresses out\
    \ of its indirect provider's block, and the organization\n   changes its indirect\
    \ provider, or the organization's direct provider\n   changes its provider.\n\
    \   Carrying routing information has a cost associated with it. This\n   cost,\
    \ at some point, may be passed back in full to the organizations\n   that inject\
    \ the routing information. Aggregation of addressing\n   information (via CIDR)\
    \ could reduce the cost, as it allows an\n   increase in the number of destinations\
    \ covered by a single route.\n   Organizations whose addresses are allocated based\
    \ on the \"address\n   ownership\" policy (and thus may not be suitable for aggregation)\n\
    \   should be prepared to absorb the cost completely on their own.\n   Observe\
    \ that neither the \"address ownership,\" nor the \"address\n   lending\" policy,\
    \ by itself, is sufficient to guarantee Internet-wide\n   IP connectivity. Therefore,\
    \ we recommend that sites with addresses\n   allocated based on either policy\
    \ should consult their providers about\n   the reachability scope that could be\
    \ achieved with these addresses,\n   and associated costs that result from using\
    \ these addresses.\n   If an organization doesn't require Internet-wide IP connectivity,\n\
    \   then address allocation for the organization could be done based on\n   the\
    \ \"address ownership\" policy. Here, the organization may still\n   maintain\
    \ limited IP connectivity (e.g., with all the subscribers of\n   its direct provider)\
    \ by limiting the distribution scope of its\n   routing information to its direct\
    \ provider. Connectivity to the rest\n   of the Internet can be handled by mediating\
    \ gateways (e.g.,\n   application layer gateways, Network Address Translators\
    \ (NATs)). Note\n   that use of mediating gateways eliminates the need for renumbering,\n\
    \   and avoids burdening the Internet routing system with non-\n   aggregatable\
    \ addressing information; however they have other\n   drawbacks which may prove\
    \ awkward in certain situations.\n   Both renumbering (due to the \"address lending\"\
    \ policy), and non-\n   aggregated routing information (due to the \"address ownership\"\
    \n   policy), and the use of mediating gateways result in some costs.\n   Therefore,\
    \ an organization needs to analyze its own connectivity\n   requirements carefully\
    \ and compare the tradeoffs associated with\n   addresses acquired via either\
    \ policy vs. having connectivity via\n   mediating gateways (possibly augmented\
    \ by limited IP connectivity)\n   using addresses acquired via \"address ownership.\"\
    \ To reduce the cost\n   of renumbering, organizations should be strongly encouraged\
    \ to deploy\n   tools that simplify renumbering (e.g., Dynamic Host Configuration\n\
    \   Protocol [RFC 1541]). Use of the DNS should be strongly encouraged.\n"

  - "7 Summary\n   Any address allocation and management policy for IP addresses used\n\
    \   for Internet connectivity must take into account its impact on the\n   scalability\
    \ of the Public Internet routing system. Among all of the\n   possible address\
    \ allocation and management policies only the ones\n   that yield a scalable routing\
    \ system are feasible. All other policies\n   are self-destructive in nature,\
    \ as they lead to a collapse of the\n   Internet routing system, and therefore\
    \ to the fragmentation\n   (partitioning) of the Public Internet.\n   Within the\
    \ context of the current Public Internet, address allocation\n   and management\
    \ policies that assume unrestricted address ownership\n   have an extremely negative\
    \ impact on the scalability of the Internet\n   routing system. Such policies\
    \ are almost certain to exhaust the\n   scalability of the Internet routing system\
    \ well before we approach\n   the exhaustion of the IPv4 address space and before\
    \ we can make\n   effective use of the IPv6 address space. Given the Internet's\
    \ growth\n   rate and current technology, the notion that everyone can own address\n\
    \   space and receive Internet-wide routing services, despite where they\n   connect\
    \ to the Internet, is currently technically infeasible.\n   Therefore, this document\
    \ makes two recommendations. First, the\n   \"address lending\" policy should\
    \ be formally added to the set of\n   address allocation policies in the Public\
    \ Internet. Second,\n   organizations that do not provide a sufficient degree\
    \ of routing\n   information aggregation to obtain access to the Internet routing\n\
    \   services should be strongly encouraged to use this policy to gain\n   access\
    \ to the services.\n   Since the current IPv6 address allocation architecture\
    \ is based on\n   CIDR, recommendations presented in this document apply to IPv6\n\
    \   address allocation and management policies as well.\n"

  - "8 Security Considerations\n   Renumbering a site has several possible implications\
    \ on the security\n   policies of both the site itself and sites that regularly\
    \ communicate\n   with the renumbering sites.\n   Many sites currently use \"\
    firewall\" systems to provide coarse-grained\n   access control from external\
    \ networks, such as The Internet, to their\n   internal systems.  Such firewalls\
    \ might include access control\n   decisions based on the claimed source address\
    \ of packets arriving at\n   such firewall systems.  When the firewall policy\
    \ relates to packets\n   arriving on the firewall from inside the site, then that\
    \ firewall\n   will need to be reconfigured at the same time that the site itself\n\
    \   renumbers.  When the firewall policy relates to packets arriving at\n   the\
    \ firewall from outside the site, then such firewalls will need to\n   be reconfigured\
    \ whenever an outside site that is granted any access\n   inside the site through\
    \ the firewall is renumbered.\n   It is highly inadvisable to rely upon unauthenticated\
    \ source or\n   destination IP addresses for security policy decisions. [Bellovin89]\n\
    \   IP address spoofing is not difficult with widely available systems,\n   such\
    \ as personal computers.  A better approach would probably involve\n   the use\
    \ of IP Security techniques, such as the IP Authentication\n   Header [RFC-1826]\
    \ or IP Encapsulating Security Payload [RFC-1827], at\n   the firewall so that\
    \ the firewall can rely on cryptographic\n   techniques for identification when\
    \ making its security policy\n   decisions.\n   It is strongly desirable that\
    \ authentication be present in any\n   mechanism used to renumber IP nodes.  A\
    \ renumbering mechanism that\n   lacks authentication could be used by an adversary\
    \ to renumber\n   systems that should not have been renumbered, for example.\n\
    \   There may be other security considerations that are not covered in\n   this\
    \ document.\n"
