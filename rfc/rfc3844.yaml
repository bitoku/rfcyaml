  - "Abstract\n   This Informational document records the history of discussions in\
    \ the\n   Problem WG during 2003 of how to resolve the problems described in\n\
    \   the IETF Problem Statement. It decomposes each of the problems\n   described\
    \ into a few areas for improvement and categorizes them as\n   either problems\
    \ affecting the routine processes used to create\n   standards or problems affecting\
    \ the fundamental structure and\n   practices of the IETF.  Expeditious and non-disruptive\
    \ solutions are\n   proposed for the problems affecting routine processes.\n \
    \  The document also lists suggested ways to handle the development of\n   solutions\
    \ for the structure and practices problems proposed in IETF\n   discussions. \
    \ Neither the working group nor the wider IETF has\n   reached consensus on a\
    \ recommendation for any of the proposals. This\n   document therefore has no\
    \ alternative but to suggest that the search\n   for structure and practices solutions\
    \ be handed back to the control\n   of the IESG.\n   While there was working group\
    \ consensus on the processes for short-\n   term and medium term improvements,\
    \ there was no working group\n   consensus on the proposals for longer-term improvements.\
    \  This\n   document therefore includes longer-term improvement proposals only\
    \ as\n   a matter of record; they must not be regarded as recommendations from\n\
    \   the working group.\n"

- title: 1. Introduction

  - "1. Introduction\n   This document suggests processes to address several problems\
    \ facing\n   the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) that have been described\n\
    \   in the IETF Problem Statement [1].\n   This document begins with an outline\
    \ of what are currently thought to\n   be the purpose and core values of the IETF,\
    \ and it offers a reminder\n   of the good things about the IETF that we don't\
    \ want to lose in the\n   process of solving our problems.\n   Each of the problems\
    \ described in the problem statement is analyzed\n   and decomposed into a few\
    \ areas for improvement.  The areas for\n   improvement appear to fall into two\
    \ categories:\n   o  Areas that are essentially independent of the other problems\
    \ and,\n      hence, can be addressed immediately, via discrete, minimally\n \
    \     disruptive changes or improvements to the 'routine' processes of\n     \
    \ the IETF.\n   o  Areas that are interdependent and are likely to affect structural\n\
    \      matters that characterize the way in which the IETF operates.\n      Addressing\
    \ these areas will probably need a more integrated\n      approach, as they may\
    \ require actions such as fundamental changes\n      to our organizational structure\
    \ or standards-track processes.\n   It is suggested that the IETF work on these\
    \ two classes of\n   improvements in parallel, so that we can enjoy some near-term\n\
    \   benefits while more structural improvements are being carefully\n   considered\
    \ and executed.\n   Concrete suggestions are included for how we can begin or\
    \ continue\n   work on the independent routine improvements.\n   Due to lack of\
    \ consensus, no firm suggestions are included on how to\n   address the more structural\
    \ changes that may be needed.  The document\n   lists the various proposals which\
    \ have been considered by the working\n   group and the wider IETF at the IETF\
    \ 57 plenary session in Vienna,\n   July 2003.  This document can only suggest,\
    \ as some participants have\n   proposed, that the IESG itself control the development\
    \ of any\n   solutions to the structural problems.\n"
- title: 2. IETF Purpose and Core Values
  contents:
  - "2. IETF Purpose and Core Values\n   As we consider how to address the problems\
    \ with the IETF processes\n   and organizational structure, it is important to\
    \ keep in mind the\n   things about the IETF that we don't want to change -- our\
    \ sense of\n   purpose, and the core values that give the IETF its unique identity.\n\
    \   At two IESG plenary meetings in 2002, the chair of the IETF, gave\n   presentations\
    \ outlining his view of the purpose and core values of\n   the IETF which may\
    \ serve as a useful basis for focusing on our\n   mission and core values.\n \
    \  At the IESG plenary in London in July 2002, it was stated that the\n   purpose\
    \ of the IETF is to \"produce high quality, relevant, and timely\n   technical\
    \ standards for the Internet\".  Our organizational structure\n   and processes\
    \ should be judged by how well they help us to achieve\n   that mission.\n   At\
    \ the following IESG plenary in Atlanta, Georgia in November 2002,\n   five core\
    \ values of the IETF were presented [8]:\n         \"Cares for the Internet\"\n\
    \         \"Technically Competent\"\n         \"Open Process\"\n         \"Volunteer\
    \ Core\"\n         \"Rough Consensus and Running Code\"\n"
- title: 2.1.  Non-Core Values
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Non-Core Values\n   Understanding our core values will also help us to\
    \ understand the\n   long-standing features of the IETF that we can change without\n\
    \   compromising our values or sacrificing our unique identity.\n   During the\
    \ November 2002 IESG Plenary, the IETF chair also presented\n   the following\
    \ \"non-core values\" [8]:\n         - The division into WGs and Areas\n     \
    \    - The three-step standards process\n         - The ASCII format for RFCs\
    \ and I-Ds\n         - The format of IETF meetings\n         - The structure of\
    \ WG mailing lists\n         - The powers of the IESG and IAB\n   These things\
    \ were designed to help us achieve our goals in a way that\n   is consistent with\
    \ our core values.  If they are no longer effective,\n   we can and should change\
    \ them.\n"
- title: 3.  Building on our Success
  contents:
  - "3.  Building on our Success\n   While focusing on our operational problems, we\
    \ shouldn't forget that\n   the IETF is a very successful organization.  We are\
    \ responsible for\n   some of the most widely used communications standards in\
    \ the world,\n   and we have contributed to the creation and growth of the Internet,\n\
    \   one of the greatest technical and social achievements of our time.\n   In\
    \ good times, it is easy to succeed despite operational\n   inefficiencies, so\
    \ organizations tend to ignore operational problems\n   and focus on their success.\
    \  In bad times, organizations can become\n   overly critical of their own structure\
    \ and processes, blaming the\n   organization for problems that are actually caused\
    \ by outside forces.\n   We are currently suffering difficult times in the IETF\
    \ and throughout\n   the communications industry.  The IETF should be careful\
    \ not to\n   unjustly blame our own organizational structure or processes for\
    \ the\n   effects of industry-wide changes such as:\n   o  Economic issues in\
    \ the global communications industry, which are\n      causing increased scrutiny\
    \ regarding expenses and return-on-\n      investment.  These same factors are\
    \ causing job changes and\n      uncertainty for many IETF participants.\n   o\
    \  The commercialization of the Internet, which has drastically\n      increased\
    \ the financial impacts of standardization.\n   o  The convergence of the datacom\
    \ and telecom sectors of the\n      communications industry, which has led to\
    \ an influx of experienced\n      people into the IETF with a different culture\
    \ and industry\n      perspective.\n   Although it is important to recognize and\
    \ correct the serious\n   organizational problems currently facing the IETF, many\
    \ of these\n   problems have existed for years, and the IETF has been successful\
    \ in\n   spite of these issues.  We should not overreact to these issues with\n\
    \   sweeping revolutionary changes to the IETF structure and processes.\n   Instead,\
    \ we should focus on developing a culture of continuous\n   operational improvement\
    \ through which we can evolve our\n   organizational structure and processes to\
    \ make them more scalable and\n   effective.  We should take this opportunity\
    \ to develop the mechanisms\n   and processes that we can use to continually monitor\
    \ and improve our\n   organizational effectiveness, both in good times and bad\
    \ times.\n   The IETF currently has a large amount of valuable work underway,\
    \ and\n   care should be taken not to disrupt or delay that work while we\n  \
    \ address our organizational problems.\n   The IETF is also fortunate to have\
    \ a large number of extremely\n   talented and dedicated individuals that serve\
    \ in formal and informal\n   leadership roles throughout the organization.  We\
    \ should be careful\n   not to alienate or disenfranchise the IETF's key contributors\
    \ and\n   those who provide the driving force for the work while making\n   organizational\
    \ or process changes.\n"
- title: 4.  Problem Decomposition
  contents:
  - "4.  Problem Decomposition\n   The problem statement document lists seven root\
    \ cause problems\n   currently facing the IETF, without making any judgements\
    \ about the\n   relative priority of the problems (apart from the first one):\n\
    \   o  Participants in the IETF do not share a common understanding of\n     \
    \ its mission;\n   o  The IETF does not consistently use effective engineering\n\
    \      practices;\n   o  The IETF has difficulty handling large and/or complex\
    \ problems;\n   o  The three stage standards hierarchy is not properly utilized;\n\
    \   o  The IETF's workload exceeds the number of fully engaged\n      participants;\n\
    \   o  The IETF management structure is not matched to the current size\n    \
    \  and complexity of the IETF;\n   o  Working group practices can make issue closure\
    \ difficult; and\n   o  IETF participants and leaders are inadequately prepared\
    \ for their\n      roles.\n   Analysis of these problems indicates that they can\
    \ be decomposed into\n   several areas for improvement, some of which can be addressed\n\
    \   immediately by independent actions while others require greater\n   consideration\
    \ and a more structured approach to a solution.\n   It is also important to note\
    \ that the problem statement lists\n   problems that have been reported by some\
    \ members of the IETF.\n   Although all of these problems are believed to exist,\
    \ not all of\n   these problems are present in all parts of the IETF, and some\
    \ of\n   these problems may in fact be symptoms of other problems.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Decomposition of Mission Problem
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Decomposition of Mission Problem\n   In order to determine the best organization\
    \ and processes for the\n   IETF to fulfill its mission and achieve its goals,\
    \ the organization\n   needs to articulate a common understanding of its current\
    \ mission and\n   goals.  Although it should be possible to reach an understanding\
    \ of\n   the mission and goals of the IETF as an independent action, with no\n\
    \   disruption to current processes, this effort would be most valuable\n   as\
    \ part of an effort to align the organization and priorities of the\n   IETF with\
    \ its mission.\n   As part of understanding our mission, the IETF will need to\
    \ identify\n   our stakeholders and understand how we serve them.  We will need\
    \ to\n   define the scope of the IETF, so that it is possible to determine\n \
    \  what is in-scope and out-of-scope for the organization.  We will also\n   need\
    \ to define our goals and priorities, and learn how to recognize\n   and measure\
    \ our own progress and success.\n   A continuing review of the mission and goals\
    \ of the IETF needs to be\n   undertaken to ensure that they remain aligned with\
    \ technology\n   developments as well as the needs of the industry in general\
    \ and our\n   stakeholders in particular.\n   Once an understanding of the mission\
    \ and goals of the IETF has been\n   articulated, we should train new participants\
    \ on those principles, so\n   that they can become quickly acclimated to the IETF\
    \ culture.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Decomposition of the Engineering Practices Problem
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Decomposition of the Engineering Practices Problem\n   The IETF lacks effective\
    \ engineering practices in four major areas:\n   1.  Failure to clearly define\
    \ the scope of the work, engineering\n       trade-offs and acceptance criteria\
    \ for each project.\n   2.  Lack of effective mechanisms for issue tracking and/or\
    \ document\n       change control.\n   3.  Lack of effective processes to ensure\
    \ quality throughout the\n       development of IETF work items, such as intermediate\
    \ acceptance\n       criteria or formal review processes.\n   4.  Sufficient focus\
    \ on milestones, and recognition or rewards for\n       individuals or groups\
    \ that achieve timely, high quality\n       execution.\n   Some of these areas\
    \ (issue tracking and revision control) would\n   require that tools are made\
    \ available to WG chairs and editors, and\n   that IETF participants (at various\
    \ levels) are educated in how to use\n   them.\n   The other areas concern the\
    \ formation and process management of IETF\n   WGs, and would require documentation\
    \ and adoption of effective\n   engineering processes within IETF WGs.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Decomposition of the Complex Problems Problem
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Decomposition of the Complex Problems Problem\n   The IETF has effective\
    \ mechanisms for dealing with well-defined\n   problems of limited scope.  These\
    \ problems are well handled in IETF\n   WGs, where experts in a given technology\
    \ can convene and solve the\n   problems specific to one technology area.  However,\
    \ we are much less\n   effective at resolving complex problems that affect more\
    \ than one\n   IETF WG or area.\n   Today most communication between WG chairs,\
    \ especially across area\n   boundaries, goes through the IESG.  Some inter-WG\
    \ or inter-area\n   communication problems could be alleviated by greater communication\n\
    \   and coordination directly between the chairs of related WGs.  There\n   are\
    \ some immediate efforts underway that are intended to increase\n   communication\
    \ between WG chairs.\n   Other complex problems involve higher-level issues, such\
    \ as unified\n   architecture or highly-coordinated multi-area efforts.  As part\
    \ of\n   any IETF reorganization, we should consider management structures\n \
    \  that will allow us to achieve a better focus on architectural and\n   cross-area\
    \ issues.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Decomposition of the Standards Hierarchy Problem
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Decomposition of the Standards Hierarchy Problem\n   There are several\
    \ problems with the IETF's three-track standards\n   process.  These problems\
    \ can be grouped as follows:\n   o  The three standards-track steps are not used\
    \ effectively within\n      the IETF.\n   o  The IETF standards-track is not well\
    \ understood by the users of\n      IETF standards.\n   o  The current standards\
    \ process does not make it easy for users to\n      locate a set of related documents,\
    \ such as an architectural\n      framework and associated protocols.\n   o  The\
    \ IETF does not have an effective way to maintain IETF\n      standards.\n   Major\
    \ changes to the standards-track should only be considered as\n   part of an integrated\
    \ structural review process that includes an\n   understanding of our mission\
    \ and goals.\n   However, there may be immediate changes that we could make to\
    \ better\n   maintain current IETF standards, or to make them more accessible\
    \ to\n   users.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Decomposition of the Engagement Problem
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Decomposition of the Engagement Problem\n   The engagement problem can\
    \ be decomposed into three primary issues:\n   o  Some WGs do not have sufficient\
    \ participation, and WG documents\n      are often produced by very small groups\
    \ of people, perhaps with\n      limited expertise in some relevant areas.\n \
    \  o  WG documents are not adequately reviewed by people outside of the\n    \
    \  originating WG.\n   o  People lose interest in longer-lived WGs, especially\
    \ when\n      protocols take a very long time to develop.\n   When too few people,\
    \ or people representing too few areas of\n   expertise, review WG documents this\
    \ can result in poor quality\n   output.  We need to find ways to increase the\
    \ effectiveness of\n   document review at all levels.\n   Quality processes based\
    \ entirely on a gatekeeper at the end, whether\n   that gatekeeper is the IESG\
    \ or a WG review board, tend to result in a\n   lower focus on quality by other\
    \ participants.  So, it is likely that\n   instituting better quality processes\
    \ throughout document development,\n   including acceptance criteria and review\
    \ at several stages, would\n   increase the focus of WG participants on document\
    \ quality.\n   When the interest of document editors or key contributors starts\
    \ to\n   lag, this can cause serious problems for a WG.  This most often\n   happens\
    \ when WGs are floundering, or when charters are so loose that\n   WGs lose focus.\
    \  It also happens when WG documents get delayed in AD\n   review and/or IESG\
    \ review for long periods with little feedback, or\n   when the WG lacks consensus\
    \ to progress its documents.  Improvements\n   to our processes for chartering,\
    \ tracking or managing WGs could help\n   to alleviate many of these problems.\n\
    \   We also need to better understand what motivates people to become\n   deeply\
    \ engaged in the IETF and to remain engaged.  It is possible\n   that expanding\
    \ the number of formal leadership positions and/or\n   coming up with more effective\
    \ ways to acknowledge our top technical\n   contributors could encourage more\
    \ people to become, and remain,\n   deeply engaged in IETF.\n"
- title: 4.6.  Decomposition of the Management Scaling Problem
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Decomposition of the Management Scaling Problem\n   There are several issues\
    \ grouped into the concept that the management\n   structure of the IETF is not\
    \ well matched to the size and complexity\n   of the organization.  One or two\
    \ of these problems might be addressed\n   by immediate solutions, but resolving\
    \ the primary problem will\n   require some type of IETF reorganization.\n   There\
    \ are five major areas for improvement that are grouped under\n   this problem:\n\
    \   o  The current organization of the IETF does not scale.  IESG members\n  \
    \    are running too many WGs, reviewing too many documents, etc.  Most\n    \
    \  IESG members have dozens of direct reports (WG chairs, directorate\n      members,\
    \ etc.). In its current form, there are very few people who\n      could do a\
    \ good job as an IESG member, and the huge time\n      commitment and responsibilities\
    \ of this role make it very\n      difficult to find qualified people who are\
    \ willing to serve on the\n      IESG.\n   o  Current IESG members and other IETF\
    \ leaders are overloaded.\n   o  The IETF selection processes have tended to select\
    \ leaders (IESG,\n      IAB and WG chairs) from the same small pool of people.\
    \  The IETF\n      needs to identify and develop additional leadership, and to\n\
    \      delegate real authority and influence to a larger group.\n   o  The IETF\
    \ is not effective at identifying and developing new\n      leaders, and we lack\
    \ sufficient recognition for the contributions\n      of IETF participants.\n\
    \   o  One or two IESG members can block WG documents indefinitely (in AD\n  \
    \    review or IESG review).\n   Some level of IETF reorganization is needed to\
    \ improve in the first\n   two areas.  This should be undertaken as part of the\
    \ structural\n   improvement effort.\n   In parallel with any more structural\
    \ IETF reorganization, some relief\n   could be achieved by modifying IESG internal\
    \ processes to remove the\n   potential for one or two IESG members to indefinitely\
    \ delay a WG\n   document, either on purpose or due to work overload.  The I-D\
    \ tracker\n   has already resulted in some improvement in this area, as it has\n\
    \   created visibility regarding how and why a document is being delayed,\n  \
    \ but it may not have resolved all of the issues in this area.\n   The IESG may\
    \ also be able to take near-term steps, with community\n   visibility and agreement,\
    \ to delegate more work to WG chairs, to\n   directorates, to the IAB, or to other\
    \ people in formal or informal\n   leadership positions.  If additional leadership\
    \ positions are needed\n   for this purpose, the IESG should consider creating\
    \ them.\n   The IESG could also help to expand the leadership pool of the IETF\
    \ by\n   actively seeking interested and qualified people for leadership\n   positions,\
    \ and by using more open processes for the selection of WG\n   chairs and other\
    \ influential positions.\n"

    \ of routine that are less likely to be\n   substantially modified by any proposed\
    \ structural changes, thus\n   minimizing the likelihood of double changes.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Improvements to Routine Processes
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Improvements to Routine Processes\n   Many of the problems currently facing\
    \ the IETF can be resolved, or\n   mitigated, through near-term improvements to\
    \ our current IETF\n   organization and routine processes.  Many of these improvements\
    \ are\n   completely separable, and there is no reason to aggregate these\n  \
    \ efforts into a single IETF WG.  It is also unnecessary that all of\n   these\
    \ changes be directed by the (already overworked) IESG.\n   However, in order\
    \ to prevent the chaos and confusion that could be\n   caused by trying to change\
    \ everything at once, it is recommended that\n   we choose a few high priority\
    \ areas for improvement and focus on\n   making improvements in those areas.\n\
    \   In choosing which areas to pursue first, we should consider the\n   following\
    \ criteria:\n   o  We should address our most urgent, important problems.\n  \
    \ o  The areas chosen should be cleanly separable, to allow multiple\n      improvements\
    \ to be carried out in parallel with minimal\n      interference.\n   o  We should\
    \ maximize the benefit vs. the cost of making the\n      improvements (i.e., look\
    \ for low hanging fruit).\n   o  As much as possible, we should focus on improvements\
    \ that are less\n      likely to be completely invalidated by an overhaul of the\
    \ IETF\n      management structure.  This might be accomplished by focusing on\n\
    \      improvements at the WG and participant levels, rather than at the\n   \
    \   IESG/IAB level.\n   In the sections above, we have identified several areas\
    \ of routine\n   that could benefit from near-term improvements, including:\n\
    \   1.  Improve WG quality processes and the effectiveness of document\n     \
    \  reviews at all levels.\n   2.  Increase the availability and use of issue tracking\
    \ and document\n       sharing/revision control software in the IETF.\n   3. \
    \ Improve training and resources for IETF leaders and participants\n       at\
    \ all levels.\n   4.  Improved communication between WG chairs to identify and\
    \ resolve\n       inter-WG and inter-area problems.\n   5.  Consider IETF processes\
    \ or structures to better maintain IETF\n       standards.\n   6.  Modify IESG-internal\
    \ processes to make it impossible for one or\n       two IESG members to indefinitely\
    \ delay a document.\n   7.  Modify IESG processes to delegate more responsibility\
    \ to WG\n       chairs, to directorates, to the IAB or to people in other formal\n\
    \       or informal leadership positions.\n   8.  Modify the WG chair selection\
    \ processes to widen the group of\n       people considered, and consider ways\
    \ to develop more leaders for\n       the IETF.\n   9.  Initiate regular AD review\
    \ of WG milestones and progress.\n   Applying the criteria outlined above, it\
    \ would make the most sense to\n   address areas 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 through immediate\
    \ near-term efforts.\n   These are high-priority issues, they are sufficiently\
    \ separable to be\n   pursued in parallel, they place minimal additional burden\
    \ on the\n   IESG, and they are the least likely to be affected by an\n   IESG/IAB-level\
    \ reorganization of the IETF, or by changes to the\n   standards-track document\
    \ maturity level classification and process.\n   Specific recommendations for\
    \ how to proceed in each of these areas\n   are made in the following sections.\n\
    \   The IESG should consider internal changes to address areas 6, 7, and\n   8.\
    \ Area 9 would require a substantial time commitment from IESG\n   members, so\
    \ it is not suggested that near-term improvements be\n   pursued in this area,\
    \ unless the IESG believes that the near-term\n   benefits would justify the effort.\n"

  - "5.1.1.  Suggestions to Improve WG Quality Processes\n   A working group should\
    \ be formed in the General Area of the IETF to\n   oversee improvements to the\
    \ WG quality processes, including: The WG\n   (re-)chartering process, the quality\
    \ processes used by IETF WGs, and\n   the effectiveness of IETF reviews at all\
    \ levels.  It should be the\n   goal of this WG to improve the quality and timeliness\
    \ of WG work\n   output.  This WG would be chartered to resolve the non-tools-related\n\
    \   portions of the Engineering Practices problem (Section 4.2) the WG-\n   related\
    \ portions of the Engagement Problem (Section 4.5), and the\n   non-training-related\
    \ portions of the WG Practices problem (Section\n   4.7).\n   A great deal of\
    \ efficiency and synergy can be achieved by adopting\n   common processes throughout\
    \ an organization.  However, it is a\n   strength of the IETF that WG chairs are\
    \ given a great deal of\n   latitude to choose their own processes and tools,\
    \ based on the size\n   and nature of their WGs.  So, in general, processes and\
    \ tools should\n   be made available to WGs and WG chairs, not forced upon them.\n"
- title: 5.1.2.  Suggestions to Increase the Use of Tools
  contents:
  - "5.1.2.  Suggestions to Increase the Use of Tools\n   Ideally, the proliferation\
    \ of tools within the IETF would be\n   accomplished via grass-roots efforts,\
    \ organized by participants\n   within the IETF.  One example of this type of\
    \ effort is the recent\n   adoption of Jabber for use during IETF meetings.\n\
    \   However, it is also possible that the IESG could designate functional\n  \
    \ leaders for specific tools-related efforts and support those leaders\n   in\
    \ organizing those efforts.  It also might be helpful for the IETF\n   to set-aside\
    \ some technical and systems resources, to make useful\n   tools available to\
    \ WGs and participants throughout the IETF.\n   These efforts should resolve the\
    \ tools-related portions of the\n   Engineering Practices problem (Section 4.2).\n"

    \ and training\n   sessions for experienced WG chairs.  These efforts should be\n\
    \   continued.\n   The IESG could help to promote chair-to-chair communication\
    \ by\n   encouraging direct communication between WG chairs when multi-WG\n  \
    \ issues arise.\n   However, most of the responsibility for establishing effective\n\
    \   chair-to-chair communications channels lies with the individual WG\n   chairs.\
    \  We should stop relying on the IESG to resolve inter-WG\n   issues, and start\
    \ communicating with each other directly regarding\n   inter-WG issues.\n   These\
    \ efforts may help to alleviate the Complex Problems problem\n   (Section 4.3),\

- title: 5.2.  Changing the Structure and Practices of the IETF
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Changing the Structure and Practices of the IETF\n   A significant number\
    \ of the issues that were identified in the IETF\n   Problem Statement appear\
    \ to require alterations to the structure of\n   the IETF and/or the core practices\
    \ which effectively characterize the\n   IETF.  From the analysis in Section 4\
    \ the problems which might\n   require such alterations include:\n   o  The Mission\
    \ Problem (Section 4.1, [7]),\n   o  the Complex Problems problem (Section 4.3,\
    \ [3], [6]),\n   o  the Standards Hierarchy problem (Section 4.4, [4]),\n   o\
    \  the Management Scaling problem (Section 4.6, [6], [3], [2]), and\n   o  The\
    \ longer-term portions of the Engagement Problem (Section 4.5,\n      [5])\n \
    \  (Additional references on each item indicate associated documents\n   that\
    \ may need to be updated as a result of this process.)\n   Poorly thought through\
    \ changes to these areas could result in\n   irretrievable damage to the nature\
    \ and effectiveness of the IETF, but\n   it seems essential that the necessary\
    \ changes are identified and\n   accepted by the IETF community as quickly as\
    \ possible.  To achieve\n   acceptance by the largest possible number of IETF\
    \ stakeholders, as\n   many of them as possible should be involved in the development\
    \ of the\n   changes; the development and acceptance processes must be as open\
    \ as\n   possible in line with normal IETF principles.\n   Development of the\
    \ required changes under the aegis of a General Area\n   Working Group was extensively\
    \ debated and a proposal was floated in a\n   previous version of this document.\
    \  The proposal included a draft\n   charter for the working group.  This way\
    \ forwards has now been\n   rejected by the Problem working group because of\n\
    \      the perceived slow progress of such groups,\n      the difference in the\
    \ nature of the problem from the usual\n      technical problems solved by IETF\
    \ working groups and\n      the difficulty in achieving acceptance by all segments\
    \ of the\n      community for work driven by a small group.\n   A proposal for\
    \ coordination of the development of the structural\n   changes by a 'Strategy\
    \ and Answers Panel' composed of delegates from\n   IESG, IAB, and ISOC plus a\
    \ number of members from the wider IETF\n   community (forming a small majority\
    \ of the panel) selected using the\n   nomcom selection process can be found in\
    \ [9].  The selection process\n   was intended to create a panel which would represent\
    \ the interests of\n   the whole IETF community and so build solutions that would\
    \ be\n   acceptable to the whole community.  This proposal has not received\n\
    \   extensive support from the Problem working group either.\n   Other proposals\
    \ advanced in discussions are:\n   o  Delegation of the development of solutions\
    \ to a team of 'wise men'\n      appointed by the IESG.\n   o  Development of\
    \ solutions by a design team with final approval by\n      the IESG.\n   o  Development\
    \ and implementation of the solutions by the IESG.\n   Discussions of alternative\
    \ processes on the mailing list, at the\n   Problem WG meeting at IETF 57 and\
    \ in the IETF 57 plenary did not\n   reach a consensus.  Indeed some contributors\
    \ took the view that the\n   problems could be overcome without (major) structural\
    \ changes.\n   Given the lack of consensus and the lack of additional responses\
    \ to a\n   previous appeal for alternative suggestions, this document has to\n\
    \   fall back to asking the IESG to take responsibility for controlling\n   the\
    \ development of solutions to the structural problems identified\n   where it\
    \ believes they are necessary.\n"
- title: 6.  Conclusion
  contents:
  - "6.  Conclusion\n   The IETF has problems, and we need to work to solve those\
    \ problems,\n   both via focused immediate improvements and possibly via an\n\
    \   integrated effort to build an IETF organizational structure and\n   develop\
    \ processes that can better handle our current size and\n   complexity.\n   However,\
    \ the IETF is also an effective organization with a long\n   tradition of excellence,\
    \ and core values that we don't want to\n   compromise in the course of improving\
    \ our organization and processes.\n   So, any major changes undertaken in the\
    \ IETF should include an\n   articulation of the IETF's mission and our core values,\
    \ so that we\n   can ensure that we build an organization that can carry out our\n\
    \   mission working in line with our core values.\n   The Problem WG has not been\
    \ able to come to a consensus on a process\n   that could address the structural\
    \ changes that may or may not be\n   needed.  This is perhaps in line with previous\
    \ experience of the\n   discussion of high level concepts in the IETF - the organization\
    \ is\n   in general much better at discussion of and achieving consensus on\n\
    \   detailed concrete proposals.  This document has little alternative\n   but\
    \ to suggest that the IESG control the development of solutions to\n   any of\
    \ the structural problems where they feel that changes are\n   necessary.\n  \
    \ In the meantime, this should not be seen as gating discussions on\n   actual\
    \ solutions for these problems - for example, the active\n   discussions that\
    \ are in progress on alternatives to the current\n   maturity level system for\
    \ IETF standards.  Authors of solutions\n   should bear in mind the points made\
    \ in Section 3:  Evolutionary\n   rather than revolutionary proposals are more\
    \ likely to be acceptable,\n   and an orderly transition must be possible.\n \
    \  Working together, we can resolve the problems currently facing the\n   IETF\
    \ and make the IETF an even more effective, successful, and fun\n   place to work.\n"
