  - "5. Description of the Option\n   When the echoing option is in effect, the party
    at the end performing\n   the echoing is expected to transmit (echo) data characters
    it\n   receives back to the sender of the data characters.  The option does\n
    \  not require that the characters echoed be exactly the characters\n   received
    (for example, a number of systems echo the ASCII ESC\n   character with something
    other than the ESC character).  When the\n   echoing option is not in effect,
    the receiver of data characters\n   should not echo them back to the sender; this,
    of course, does not\n   prevent the receiver from responding to data characters
    received.\n   The normal TELNET connection is two way.  That is, data flows in
    each\n   direction on the connection independently; and neither, either, or\n
    \  both directions may be operating simultaneously in echo mode.  There\n   are
    five reasonable modes of operation for echoing on a connection\n   pair:\n                <----------------\n
    \     Process 1                   Process 2\n                ---------------->\n
    \                Neither end echoes\n                <----------------\n                   \\\n
    \     Process 1    /              Process 2\n                ---------------->\n
    \            One end echoes for itself\n"

  - "6. A Sample Implementation of the Option\n   The following is a description of
    a possible implementation for a\n   simple user system called \"UHOST\".\n   A
    possible implementation could be that for each user terminal, the\n   UHOST would
    keep three state bits: whether the terminal echoes for\n   itself (UHOST ECHO
    always) or not (ECHO mode possible), whether the\n   (human) user prefers to operate
    in ECHO mode or in non-ECHO mode, and\n   whether the connection from this terminal
    to the server is in ECHO or\n   non-ECHO mode.  We will call these three bits
    P(hysical), D(esired),\n   and A(ctual).\n   When a terminal dials up the UHOST
    the P-bit is set appropriately,\n   the D-bit is set equal to it, and the A-bit
    is set to non-ECHO.  The\n   P-bit and D-bit may be manually reset by direct commands
    if the user\n   so desires.  For example, a user in Hawaii on a \"full-duplex\"\n
    \  terminal, would choose not to operate in ECHO mode, regardless of the\n   preference
    of a mainland server.  He should direct the UHOST to\n   change his D-bit from
    ECHO to non-ECHO.\n   When a connection is opened from the UHOST terminal to a
    server, the\n"
