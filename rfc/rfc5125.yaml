  contents:
  - "2.  Reclassification of RFC 3525 to Historic\n   The protocol defined by RFC\
    \ 3525 [RFC3525] was developed jointly by\n   the IETF Megaco Working Group and\
    \ ITU-T Study Group 16.  The ITU-T\n   published ITU-T Recommendation H.248.1\
    \ (originally H.248) with the\n   same contents as RFC 3525.  Since that initial\
    \ development, the ITU-T\n   has taken ownership of the protocol and has continued\
    \ to work on it.\n   The protocol as originally defined in RFC 3525 underwent\
    \ a series of\n   corrections and clarifications.  H.248.1 version 1 [h248v1]\
    \ was\n   republished in March, 2002, incorporating all changes agreed upon up\n\
    \   to that date.  Since then, further corrections have been agreed upon.\n  \
    \ The accumulated set of corrections to H.248.1 (03/2002) is available\n   in\
    \ the Implementors' Guide for Recommendation H.248.1 Version 1 (03/\n   2002)\
    \ (\"Media Gateway Control Protocol\") [impgdv1], which is\n   available at no\
    \ charge on the ITU-T web site.\n   RFC 3525 has been rendered even more obsolete\
    \ as a specification of\n   the Megaco/H.248 protocol by the publication of further\
    \ versions of\n   ITU-T Recommendation H.248.1.  Version 2 [h248v2] was published\
    \ in\n   May, 2002, and is the version most widely deployed at present.  It is\n\
    \   also the version that other standards bodies such as 3GPP are\n   currently\
    \ using as the basis for their own profile specifications.\n   Version 3 [h248v3]\
    \ was published more recently, in September, 2005.\n   In short, RFC 3525 may\
    \ serve as an introduction to the Megaco/H.248\n   protocol, but it is misleading\
    \ as a description of the protocol as\n   currently standardized or deployed.\
    \  It is appropriate to reclassify\n   RFC 3525 to Historic status, as described\
    \ in RFC 2026 [RFC2026].\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   Reclassifying RFC 3525 has no security implications.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   This document does not require any new actions by\
    \ the IANA.  The IANA\n   registries established by RFC 3525 and extended by successive\n\
    \   versions of ITU-T H.248.1 remain in force, along with the requirement\n  \
    \ for expert review by an IESG-designated expert.\n"
