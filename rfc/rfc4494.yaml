  - "1.  Introduction\n   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\
    \ has\n   recently specified the Cipher-based Message Authentication Code\n  \
    \ (CMAC).  CMAC [NIST-CMAC] is a message authentication code that is\n   based\
    \ on a symmetric key block cipher such as the Advanced Encryption\n   Standard\
    \ [NIST-AES].  CMAC is equivalent to the One-Key CBC MAC1\n   (OMAC1) submitted\
    \ by Iwata and Kurosawa [OMAC1a, OMAC1b].  OMAC1 is\n   an improvement of the\
    \ eXtended Cipher Block Chaining mode (XCBC)\n   submitted by Black and Rogaway\
    \ [XCBCa, XCBCb], which itself is an\n   improvement of the basic CBC-MAC.  XCBC\
    \ efficiently addresses the\n   security deficiencies of CBC-MAC, and OMAC1 efficiently\
    \ reduces the\n   key size of XCBC.\n   This memo specifies the usage of CMAC\
    \ on the authentication mechanism\n   of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload\
    \ [ESP] and Authentication\n   Header [AH] protocols.  This new algorithm is named\
    \ AES-CMAC-96.  For\n   further information on AH and ESP, refer to [AH] and [ROADMAP].\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  AES-CMAC\n   The core of AES-CMAC-96 is the AES-CMAC [AES-CMAC].  The underlying\n\
    \   algorithms for AES-CMAC are the Advanced Encryption Standard cipher\n   block\
    \ [NIST-AES] and the recently defined CMAC mode of operation\n   [NIST-CMAC].\
    \  AES-CMAC provides stronger assurance of data integrity\n   than a checksum\
    \ or an error detecting code.  The verification of a\n   checksum or an error\
    \ detecting code detects only accidental\n   modifications of the data, while\
    \ CMAC is designed to detect\n   intentional, unauthorized modifications of the\
    \ data, as well as\n   accidental modifications.  The output of AES-CMAC can validate\
    \ the\n   input message.  Validating the message provides assurance of the\n \
    \  integrity and authenticity over the message from the source.\n   According\
    \ to [NIST-CMAC], at least 64 bits should be used against\n   guessing attacks.\
    \  AES-CMAC achieves the similar security goal of\n   HMAC [RFC-HMAC].  Since\
    \ AES-CMAC is based on a symmetric key block\n   cipher (AES), while HMAC is based\
    \ on a hash function (such as SHA-1),\n   AES-CMAC is appropriate for information\
    \ systems in which AES is more\n   readily available than a hash function.  Detailed\
    \ information about\n   AES-CMAC is available in [AES-CMAC] and [NIST-CMAC].\n"
