  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The SIP protocol described in [1] defines session control\
    \ messages\n   used during the setup and tear down stages of a SIP controlled\n\
    \   session.\n   In addition, the SIP re-INVITE can be used during a session to\
    \ change\n   the characteristics of the session.  This is generally to change\
    \ the\n   properties of media flows related to the session or to update the SIP\n\
    \   session timer.\n   However, there is no general-purpose mechanism to carry\
    \ session\n   control information along the SIP signaling path during the session.\n\
    \   The purpose of the INFO message is to carry application level\n   information\
    \ along the SIP signaling path.\n   The INFO method is not used to change the\
    \ state of SIP calls, or the\n   parameters of the sessions SIP initiates.  It\
    \ merely sends optional\n   application layer information, generally related to\
    \ the session.\n   It is necessary that the mid-session signaling information\
    \ traverse\n   the post session setup SIP signaling path.  This is the path taken\
    \ by\n   SIP re-INVITEs, BYEs and other SIP requests that are tied to an\n   individual\
    \ session.  This allows SIP proxy servers to receive, and\n   potentially act\
    \ on, the mid-session signaling information.\n   This document proposes an extension\
    \ to SIP by defining the new INFO\n   method.  The INFO method would be used for\
    \ the carrying of mid-call\n   signaling information along the session signaling\
    \ path.\n   1.1 Example Uses\n      The following are a few of the potential uses\
    \ of the INFO message:\n      - Carrying mid-call PSTN signaling messages between\
    \ PSTN\n        gateways.\n      - Carrying DTMF digits generated during a SIP\
    \ session.\n      - Carrying wireless signal strength information in support of\n\
    \        wireless mobility applications.\n      - Carrying account balance information.\n\
    \      - Carrying images or other non streaming information between the\n    \
    \    participants of a session.\n      These are just potential uses; this document\
    \ does not specify such\n      uses nor does it necessarily recommend them.\n\
    \      It can also be envisioned that there will be other telephony and\n    \
    \  non-telephony uses of the INFO method.\n"
- title: 2. INFO Method
  contents:
  - "2. INFO Method\n   The INFO method is used for communicating mid-session signaling\n\
    \   information along the signaling path for the call.\n   The INFO method is\
    \ not used to change the state of SIP calls, nor\n   does it change the state\
    \ of sessions initiated by SIP.  Rather, it\n   provides additional optional information\
    \ which can further enhance\n   the application using SIP.\n   The signaling path\
    \ for the INFO method is the signaling path\n   established as a result of the\
    \ call setup.  This can be either direct\n   signaling between the calling and\
    \ called user agents or a signaling\n   path involving SIP proxy servers that\
    \ were involved in the call setup\n   and added themselves to the Record-Route\
    \ header on the initial INVITE\n   message.\n   The mid-session information can\
    \ be communicated in either an INFO\n   message header or as part of a message\
    \ body.  The definition of the\n   message body and/or message headers used to\
    \ carry the mid-session\n   information is outside the scope of this document.\n\
    \   There are no specific semantics associated with INFO.  The semantics\n   are\
    \ derived from the body or new headers defined for usage in INFO.\n   2.1 Header\
    \ Field Support for INFO Method\n      Tables 1 and 2 add a column to tables 4\
    \ and 5 in the [1].  Refer\n      to Section 6 of [1] for a description of the\
    \ content of the\n      tables.  Note that the rules defined in the enc. and e-e\
    \ columns\n      in tables 4 and 5 in [1] also apply to use of the headers in\
    \ the\n      INFO request and responses to the INFO request.\n   2.2 Responses\
    \ to the INFO Request Method\n      If a server receives an INFO request it MUST\
    \ send a final\n      response.\n      A 200 OK response MUST be sent by a UAS\
    \ for an INFO request with\n      no message body if the INFO request was successfully\
    \ received for\n      an existing call.  Beyond that, no additional operations\
    \ are\n      required.\n          Header                    Where    INFO\n  \

    \  If the INFO request contains a body that the server does not\n      understand\

- title: 3. INFO Message Bodies
  contents:
  - "3. INFO Message Bodies\n   The purpose of the INFO message is to carry mid-session\
    \ information\n   between SIP user agents.  This information will generally be\
    \ carried\n   in message bodies, although it can be carried in headers in the\
    \ INFO\n   message.\n   The definition of the message bodies or any new headers\
    \ created for\n   the INFO method is outside the scope of this document.  It is\n\
    \   expected that separate documents will be created to address\n   definition\
    \ of these entities.\n   In addition, the INFO method does not define additional\
    \ mechanisms\n   for ensuring in-order delivery.  While the CSeq header will be\n\
    \   incremented upon the transmission of new INFO messages, this should\n   not\
    \ be used to determine the sequence of INFO information.  This is\n   due to the\
    \ fact that there could be gaps in the INFO message CSeq\n   count caused by a\
    \ user agent sending re-INVITES or other SIP\n   messages.\n"
- title: 4. Guidelines for extensions making use of INFO
  contents:
  - "4. Guidelines for extensions making use of INFO\n   The following are considerations\
    \ that should be taken into account\n   when defining SIP extensions that make\
    \ use of the INFO method.\n   - Consideration should be taken on the size of message\
    \ bodies to be\n     carried by INFO messages.  The message bodies should be kept\
    \ small\n     due to the potential for the message to be carried over UDP and\
    \ the\n     potential for fragmentation of larger messages.\n   - There is potential\
    \ that INFO messages could be forked by a SIP\n     Proxy Server.  The implications\
    \ of this forking of the information\n     in the INFO message need to be taken\
    \ into account.\n   - The use of multi-part message bodies may be helpful when\
    \ defining\n     the message bodies to be carried by the INFO message.\n   - The\
    \ extensions that use the INFO message MUST NOT rely on the\n     INFO message\
    \ to do anything that effects the SIP call state or the\n     state of related\
    \ sessions.\n   - The INFO extension defined in this document does not depend\
    \ on\n     the use of the Require or Proxy-Require headers.  Extensions using\n\
    \     the INFO message may need the use of these mechanisms.  However,\n     the\
    \ use of Require and Proxy-Require should be avoided, if\n     possible, in order\
    \ to improve interoperability between SIP\n     entities.\n"
- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   If the contents of the message body are private\
    \ then end-to-end\n   encryption of the message body can be used to prevent unauthorized\n\
    \   access to the content.\n   There are no other security issues specific to\
    \ the INFO method.\n   The security requirements specified in the SIP specification\
    \ apply\n   to the INFO method.\n"
