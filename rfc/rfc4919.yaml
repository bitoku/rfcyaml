- title: 2.  Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  Overview\n   A LoWPAN is a simple low cost communication network that allows\n\
    \   wireless connectivity in applications with limited power and relaxed\n   throughput\
    \ requirements.  A LoWPAN typically includes devices that\n   work together to\
    \ connect the physical environment to real-world\n   applications, e.g., wireless\
    \ sensors.  LoWPANs conform to the IEEE\n   802.15.4-2003 standard [IEEE802.15.4].\n\
    \   Some of the characteristics of LoWPANs are as follows:\n   1.   Small packet\
    \ size.  Given that the maximum physical layer packet\n        is 127 bytes, the\
    \ resulting maximum frame size at the media\n        access control layer is 102\
    \ octets.  Link-layer security imposes\n        further overhead, which in the\
    \ maximum case (21 octets of\n        overhead in the AES-CCM-128 case, versus\
    \ 9 and 13 for AES-CCM-32\n        and AES-CCM-64, respectively), leaves 81 octets\
    \ for data\n        packets.\n   2.   Support for both 16-bit short or IEEE 64-bit\
    \ extended media\n        access control addresses.\n   3.   Low bandwidth.  Data\
    \ rates of 250 kbps, 40 kbps, and 20 kbps for\n        each of the currently defined\
    \ physical layers (2.4 GHz, 915 MHz,\n        and 868 MHz, respectively).\n  \
    \ 4.   Topologies include star and mesh operation.\n   5.   Low power.  Typically,\
    \ some or all devices are battery operated.\n   6.   Low cost.  These devices\
    \ are typically associated with sensors,\n        switches, etc.  This drives\
    \ some of the other characteristics\n        such as low processing, low memory,\
    \ etc.  Numerical values for\n        \"low\" elided on purpose since costs tend\
    \ to change over time.\n   7.  Large number of devices expected to be deployed\
    \ during the\n        lifetime of the technology.  This number is expected to\
    \ dwarf\n        the number of deployed personal computers, for example.\n   8.\
    \   Location of the devices is typically not predefined, as they\n        tend\
    \ to be deployed in an ad-hoc fashion.  Furthermore,\n        sometimes the location\
    \ of these devices may not be easily\n        accessible.  Additionally, these\
    \ devices may move to new\n        locations.\n   9.   Devices within LoWPANs\
    \ tend to be unreliable due to variety of\n        reasons: uncertain radio connectivity,\
    \ battery drain, device\n        lockups, physical tampering, etc.\n   10.  In\
    \ many environments, devices connected to a LoWPAN may sleep\n        for long\
    \ periods of time in order to conserve energy, and are\n        unable to communicate\
    \ during these sleep periods.\n   The following sections take into account these\
    \ characteristics in\n   describing the assumptions, problems statement, and goals\
    \ for\n   LoWPANs, and, in particular, for 6LoWPANs (IPv6-based LoWPAN\n   networks).\n"
- title: 3.  Assumptions
  contents:
  - "3.  Assumptions\n   Given the small packet size of LoWPANs, this document presumes\n\
    \   applications typically send small amounts of data.  However, the\n   protocols\
    \ themselves do not restrict bulk data transfers.\n   LoWPANs, as described in\
    \ this document, are based on IEEE\n   802.15.4-2003.  It is possible that the\
    \ specification may undergo\n   changes in the future and may change some of the\
    \ requirements\n   mentioned above.\n   Some of these assumptions are based on\
    \ the limited capabilities of\n   devices within LoWPANs.  As devices become more\
    \ powerful, and consume\n   less power, some of the requirements mentioned above\
    \ may be somewhat\n   relaxed.\n   While some LoWPAN devices are expected to be\
    \ extremely limited (the\n   so-called \"Reduced Function Devices\" or RFDs),\
    \ more capable \"Full\n   Function Devices\" (FFDs) will also be present, albeit\
    \ in much smaller\n   numbers.  FFDs will typically have more resources and may\
    \ be mains\n   powered.  Accordingly, FFDs will aid RFDs by providing functions\
    \ such\n   as network coordination, packet forwarding, interfacing with other\n\
    \   types of networks, etc.\n   The application of IP technology is assumed to\
    \ provide the following\n   benefits:\n   1.  The pervasive nature of IP networks\
    \ allows use of existing\n       infrastructure.\n   2.  IP-based technologies\
    \ already exist, are well-known, and proven\n       to be working.\n   3.  An\
    \ admittedly non-technical but important consideration is that\n       IP networking\
    \ technology is specified in open and freely\n       available specifications,\
    \ which is favorable or at least able to\n       be better understood by a wider\
    \ audience than proprietary\n       solutions.\n   4.  Tools for diagnostics,\
    \ management, and commissioning of IP\n       networks already exist.\n   5. \
    \ IP-based devices can be connected readily to other IP-based\n       networks,\
    \ without the need for intermediate entities like\n       translation gateways\
    \ or proxies.\n"
- title: 4.  Problems
  contents:
  - "4.  Problems\n   Based on the characteristics defined in the overview section,\
    \ the\n   following sections elaborate on the main problems with IP for\n   LoWPANs.\n"
- title: 4.1.  IP Connectivity
  contents:
  - "4.1.  IP Connectivity\n   The requirement for IP connectivity within a LoWPAN\
    \ is driven by the\n   following:\n   1.  The many devices in a LoWPAN make network\
    \ auto configuration and\n       statelessness highly desirable.  And for this,\
    \ IPv6 has ready\n       solutions.\n   2.  The large number of devices poses\
    \ the need for a large address\n       space, well met by IPv6.\n   3.  Given\
    \ the limited packet size of LoWPANs, the IPv6 address format\n       allows subsuming\
    \ of IEEE 802.15.4 addresses if so desired.\n   4.  Simple interconnectivity to\
    \ other IP networks including the\n       Internet.\n   However, given the limited\
    \ packet size, headers for IPv6 and layers\n   above must be compressed whenever\
    \ possible.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Topologies
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Topologies\n   LoWPANs must support various topologies including mesh and\
    \ star.\n   Mesh topologies imply multi-hop routing, to a desired destination.\n\
    \   In this case, intermediate devices act as packet forwarders at the\n   link\
    \ layer (akin to routers at the network layer).  Typically these\n   are \"full\
    \ function devices\" that have more capabilities in terms of\n   power, computation,\
    \ etc.  The requirements on the routing protocol\n   are:\n   1.  Given the minimal\
    \ packet size of LoWPANs, the routing protocol\n       must impose low (or no)\
    \ overhead on data packets, hopefully\n       independently of the number of hops.\n\
    \   2.  The routing protocols should have low routing overhead (low\n       chattiness)\
    \ balanced with topology changes and power\n       conservation.\n   3.  The computation\
    \ and memory requirements in the routing protocol\n       should be minimal to\
    \ satisfy the low cost and low power\n       objectives.  Thus, storage and maintenance\
    \ of large routing\n       tables is detrimental.\n   4.  Support for network\
    \ topologies in which either FFDs or RFDs may\n       be battery or mains-powered.\
    \  This implies the appropriate\n       considerations for routing in the presence\
    \ of sleeping nodes.\n   As with mesh topologies, star topologies include provisioning\
    \ a\n   subset of devices with packet forwarding functionality.  If, in\n   addition\
    \ to IEEE 802.15.4, these devices use other kinds of network\n   interfaces such\
    \ as ethernet or IEEE 802.11, the goal is to seamlessly\n   integrate the networks\
    \ built over those different technologies.\n   This, of course, is a primary motivation\
    \ to use IP to begin with.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Limited Packet Size
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Limited Packet Size\n   Applications within LoWPANs are expected to originate\
    \ small packets.\n   Adding all layers for IP connectivity should still allow\
    \ transmission\n   in one frame, without incurring excessive fragmentation and\n\
    \   reassembly.  Furthermore, protocols must be designed or chosen so\n   that\
    \ the individual \"control/protocol packets\" fit within a single\n   802.15.4\
    \ frame.  Along these lines, IPv6's requirement of sub-IP\n   reassembly (see\
    \ Section 5) may pose challenges for low-end LoWPAN\n   devices that do not have\
    \ enough RAM or storage for a 1280-octet\n   packet.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Limited Configuration and Management
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Limited Configuration and Management\n   As alluded to above, devices within\
    \ LoWPANs are expected to be\n   deployed in exceedingly large numbers.  Additionally,\
    \ they are\n   expected to have limited display and input capabilities.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ the location of some of these devices may be hard to\n   reach.  Accordingly,\
    \ protocols used in LoWPANs should have minimal\n   configuration, preferably\
    \ work \"out of the box\", be easy to\n   bootstrap, and enable the network to\
    \ self heal given the inherent\n   unreliable characteristic of these devices.\
    \  The size constraints of\n   the link layer protocol should also be considered.\
    \  Network\n   management should have little overhead, yet be powerful enough\
    \ to\n   control dense deployment of devices.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Service Discovery
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Service Discovery\n   LoWPANs require simple service discovery network\
    \ protocols to\n   discover, control and maintain services provided by devices.\
    \  In some\n   cases, especially in dense deployments, abstraction of several\
    \ nodes\n   to provide a service may be beneficial.  In order to enable such\n\
    \   features, new protocols may have to be designed.\n"
- title: 4.6.  Security
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Security\n   IEEE 802.15.4 mandates link-layer security based on AES, but\
    \ it omits\n   any details about topics like bootstrapping, key management, and\n\
    \   security at higher layers.  Of course, a complete security solution\n   for\
    \ LoWPAN devices must consider application needs very carefully.\n   Please refer\
    \ to the security consideration section below for a more\n   detailed discussion\
    \ and in-depth security requirements.\n"
- title: 5.  Goals
  contents:
  - "5.  Goals\n   The goals mentioned below are general and not limited to IETF\n\
    \   activities.  As such, they may not only refer to work that can be\n   done\
    \ within the IETF (e.g., specification required to transmit IP,\n   profile of\
    \ best practices for transmitting IP packets, and associated\n   upper level protocols,\
    \ etc).  They also point at work more relevant\n   to other standards bodies (e.g.,\
    \ desirable changes to or profiles\n   relevant to IEEE 802.15.4, W3C, etc). \
    \ When the goals fall under the\n   IETF's purview, they serve to point out what\
    \ those efforts should\n   strive to accomplish, regardless of whether they are\
    \ pursued within\n   one (or more) new (or existing) working groups.  When the\
    \ goals do\n   not fall under the purview of the IETF, documenting them here serves\n\
    \   as input to other organizations [LIAISON].\n   Note that a common underlying\
    \ goal is to reduce packet overhead,\n   bandwidth consumption, processing requirements,\
    \ and power\n   consumption.\n   The following are the goals according to priority\
    \ for LoWPANs:\n   1.  Fragmentation and Reassembly layer: As mentioned in the\
    \ overview,\n       the protocol data units may be as small as 81 bytes.  This\
    \ is\n       obviously far below the minimum IPv6 packet size of 1280 octets,\n\
    \       and in keeping with Section 5 of the IPv6 specification\n       [RFC2460],\
    \ a fragmentation and reassembly adaptation layer must\n       be provided at\
    \ the layer below IP.\n   2.  Header Compression: Given that in the worst case\
    \ the maximum size\n       available for transmitting IP packets over an IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4 frame\n       is 81 octets, and that the IPv6 header is 40 octets long,\n\
    \       (without optional headers), this leaves only 41 octets for\n       upper-layer\
    \ protocols, like UDP and TCP.  UDP uses 8 octets in\n       the header and TCP\
    \ uses 20 octets.  This leaves 33 octets for\n       data over UDP and 21 octets\
    \ for data over TCP.  Additionally, as\n       pointed above, there is also a\
    \ need for a fragmentation and\n       reassembly layer, which will use even more\
    \ octets leaving very\n       few octets for data.  Thus, if one were to use the\
    \ protocols as\n       is, it would lead to excessive fragmentation and reassembly,\
    \ even\n       when data packets are just 10s of octets long.  This points to\n\
    \       the need for header compression.  As there is much published and\n   \
    \    in-progress standardization work on header compression, the\n       6LoWPAN\
    \ community needs to investigate using existing header\n       compression techniques,\
    \ and, if necessary, specify new ones.\n   3.  Address Autoconfiguration: [6LoWPAN]\
    \ specifies methods for\n       creating IPv6 stateless address auto configuration.\
    \  Stateless\n       auto configuration (as compared to stateful) is attractive\
    \ for\n       6LoWPANs, because it reduces the configuration overhead on the\n\
    \       hosts.  There is a need for a method to generate an \"interface\n    \
    \   identifier\" from the EUI-64 [EUI64] assigned to the IEEE 802.15.4\n     \
    \  device.\n   4.  Mesh Routing Protocol: A routing protocol to support a multi-hop\n\
    \       mesh network is necessary.  There is much published work on ad-\n    \
    \   hoc multi hop routing for devices.  Some examples include\n       [RFC3561],\
    \ [RFC3626], [RFC3684], all experimental.  Also, these\n       protocols are designed\
    \ to use IP-based addresses that have large\n       overheads.  For example, the\
    \ Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector\n       (AODV) [RFC3561] routing protocol uses\
    \ 48 octets for a route\n       request based on IPv6 addressing.  Given the packet-size\n\
    \       constraints, transmitting this packet without fragmentation and\n    \
    \   reassembly may be difficult.  Thus, care should be taken when\n       using\
    \ existing routing protocols (or designing new ones) so that\n       the routing\
    \ packets fit within a single IEEE 802.15.4 frame.\n   5.  Network Management:\
    \ One of the points of transmitting IPv6\n       packets is to reuse existing\
    \ protocols as much as possible.\n       Network management functionality is critical\
    \ for LoWPANs.\n       However, management solutions need to meet the resource\n\
    \       constraints as well as the minimal configuration and self-healing\n  \
    \     functionality described in Section 4.4. The Simple Network\n       Management\
    \ Protocol (SNMP) [RFC3410] is widely used for\n       monitoring data sources\
    \ and sensors in conventional networks.\n       SNMP functionality may be translated\
    \ \"as is\" to LoWPANs with the\n       benefit to utilize existing tools.  However,\
    \ due to the memory,\n       processing, and message size constraints, further\
    \ investigation\n       is required to determine if the use of SNMPv3 is suitable,\
    \ or if\n       an appropriate adaptation of SNMPv3 or use of different protocols\n\
    \       is in order.\n   6.  Implementation Considerations: It may be the case\
    \ that\n       transmitting IP over IEEE 802.15.4 would become more beneficial\n\
    \       if implemented in a \"certain\" way.  Accordingly, implementation\n  \
    \     considerations are to be documented.\n   7.  Application and higher layer\
    \ Considerations: As header\n       compression becomes more prevalent, overall\
    \ performance will\n       depend even more on efficiency of application protocols.\n\
    \       Heavyweight protocols based on XML such as SOAP [SOAP], may not\n    \
    \   be suitable for LoWPANs.  As such, more compact encodings (and\n       perhaps\
    \ protocols) may become necessary.  The goal here is to\n       specify or suggest\
    \ modifications to existing protocols so that\n       they are suitable for LoWPANs.\
    \  Furthermore, application level\n       interoperability specifications may\
    \ also become necessary in the\n       future and may thus be specified.\n   8.\
    \  Security Considerations: Security threats at different layers\n       must\
    \ be clearly understood and documented.  Bootstrapping of\n       devices into\
    \ a secure network could also be considered given the\n       location, limited\
    \ display, high density, and ad-hoc deployment of\n       devices.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   IPv6 over LoWPAN (6LoWPAN) applications often\
    \ require confidentiality\n   and integrity protection.  This can be provided\
    \ at the application,\n   transport, network, and/or at the link layer (i.e.,\
    \ within the\n   6LoWPAN set of specifications).  In all these cases, prevailing\n\
    \   constraints will influence the choice of a particular protocol.  Some\n  \
    \ of the more relevant constraints are small code size, low power\n   operation,\
    \ low complexity, and small bandwidth requirements.\n   Given these constraints,\
    \ first, a threat model for 6LoWPAN devices\n   needs to be developed in order\
    \ to weigh any risks against the cost of\n   their mitigations while making meaningful\
    \ assumptions and\n   simplifications.  Some examples for threats that should\
    \ be considered\n   are man-in-the-middle attacks and denial of service attacks.\n\
    \   A separate set of security considerations apply to bootstrapping a\n   6LoWPAN\
    \ device into the network (e.g., for initial key\n   establishment).  This generally\
    \ involves application level exchanges\n   or out-of-band techniques for the initial\
    \ key establishment, and may\n   rely on application-specific trust models; thus,\
    \ it is considered\n   extraneous to 6LoWPAN and is not addressed in these specifications.\n\
    \   In order to be able to select (or design) this next set of protocols,\n  \
    \ there needs to be a common model of the keying material created by\n   the initial\
    \ key establishment.\n   Beyond initial key establishment, protocols for subsequent\
    \ key\n   management as well as to secure the data traffic do fall under the\n\
    \   purview of 6LoWPAN.  Here, the different alternatives (TLS, IKE/\n   IPsec,\
    \ etc.) must be evaluated in light of the 6LoWPAN constraints.\n   One argument\
    \ for using link layer security is that most IEEE 802.15.4\n   devices already\
    \ have support for AES link-layer security.  AES is a\n   block cipher operating\
    \ on blocks of fixed length, i.e., 128 bits.  To\n   encrypt longer messages,\
    \ several modes of operation may be used.  The\n   earliest modes described, such\
    \ as ECB, CBC, OFB and CFB provide only\n   confidentiality, and this does not\
    \ ensure message integrity.  Other\n   modes have been designed which ensure both\
    \ confidentiality and\n   message integrity, such as CCM* mode. 6LoWPAN networks\
    \ can operate in\n   any of the previous modes, but it is desirable to utilize\
    \ the most\n   secure modes available for link-layer security (e.g., CCM*), and\n\
    \   build upon it.\n   For network layer security, two models are applicable:\
    \ end-to-end\n   security, e.g., using IPsec transport mode, or security that\
    \ is\n   limited to the wireless portion of the network, e.g., using a\n   security\
    \ gateway and IPsec tunnel mode.  The disadvantage of the\n   latter is the larger\
    \ header size, which is significant at the 6LoWPAN\n   frame MTUs.  To simplify\
    \ 6LoWPAN implementations, it is beneficial to\n   identify the relevant security\
    \ model, and to identify a preferred set\n   of cipher suites that are appropriate\
    \ given the constraints.\n"
