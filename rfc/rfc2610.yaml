  - "Abstract\n   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol provides a framework for\n\
    \   passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP network.\n   Entities\
    \ using the Service Location Protocol need to find out the\n   address of Directory\
    \ Agents in order to transact messages.  Another\n   option provides an assignment\
    \ of scope for configuration of SLP User\n   and Service Agents.\n"

  - "1. Introduction\n   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [2] provides a framework\
    \ for\n   passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP network.\n  \
    \ Entities using the Service Location Protocol, Version 2 [3] and\n   Service\
    \ Location Protocol, Version 1 [4] need to obtain the address\n   of Directory\
    \ Agents and Scope configuration.  The Service Location\n   Protocol (SLP) provides\
    \ a default configuration for Scopes and\n   Directory Agents may be discovered\
    \ using multicast or broadcast.  It\n   is useful in a larger deployment to be\
    \ able to configure SLP Agents\n   using DHCP, so as to centralize the administration\
    \ and to deploy SLP\n   in networks where multicast routing is not available.\n\
    \   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\"\
    ,\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in\
    \ this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].\n"

    \   The SLP Directory Agent Option specifies a list of IP addresses for\n   Directory\
    \ Agents.  Directory Agents MUST be listed in order of\n   preference, if there\
    \ is an order of preference.\n   The Length value must include one for the 'Mandatory'\
    \ byte and\n   include four for each Directory Agent address which follows.  Thus,\n\
    \   the Length minus one of the option MUST always be divisible by 4 and\n   has\
    \ a minimum value of 5.\n   The address of the Directory Agent is given in network\
    \ byte order.\n   The 'Mandatory' byte in the Directory Agent option may be set\
    \ to\n   either 0 or 1.  If it is set to 1, the SLP User Agent or Service\n  \
    \ Agent so configured MUST NOT employ either active or passive\n   multicast discovery\
    \ of Directory Agents.\n   Note that for backward compatibility with some deployed\
    \ software the\n   Mandatory byte MUST NOT be set to any byte value for which\
    \ the high\n   order bit (0x80) is set.\n   The Directory Agents listed in this\
    \ option MUST be configured with\n   the a non-empty subset of the scope list\
    \ that the Agent receiving the\n   Directory Agent Option is configured with.\
    \  See the notes below.\n   The SLPv2 specification [3] defines how to use this\
    \ option.\n"
- title: 4. SLP Service Scope Option
  contents:
  - "4. SLP Service Scope Option\n   The scope list is a comma delimited list which\
    \ indicates the scopes\n   that a SLP Agent is configured to use.\n    0     \
    \              1                   2                   3\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\

    \   |   Code = 79   |     Length    |   Mandatory   | <Scope List>...\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \   The Length indicates the number of bytes which follow.  Since the\n   Scope-List\
    \ String is encoded using UTF-8 [5] characters, it may be\n   the cast that the\
    \ Length is not the same as the number of characters\n   in the Scope-List String.\
    \  The Length value must include one for the\n   'Mandatory' byte.\n   The 'Mandatory'\
    \ byte determines whether SLP Agents override their\n   static configuration for\
    \ scopes with the <Scope List> string provided\n   by the option.  This allows\
    \ DHCP administrators to implement a policy\n   of assigning a set of scopes to\
    \ Agents for service provision.  If the\n   Mandatory byte is 0, static configuration\
    \ takes precedence over the\n   DHCP provided scope list.  If the Mandatory byte\
    \ is 1, the <Scope\n   List> provided in this option MUST be used by the SLP Agent.\n\
    \   The Scope List String syntax and usage are defined in the SLPv2\n   specification\
    \ [3].\n"
- title: 4.1. Zero Length Scope-List String Configuration
  contents:
  - "4.1. Zero Length Scope-List String Configuration\n   A SLP Service Scope Option\
    \ which indicates a Length of 1 (in other\n   words, omitting the <Scope List>\
    \ string entirely) validly configures\n   the SLP User Agent to use \"User Selectable\
    \ Scopes.\"\n   The SLP Agent will use the aggregated list of scopes of all known\n\
    \   DAs.  If no DAs are known, the UA will use SA discovery to determine\n   the\
    \ list of scopes on the network, as defined in  [3].\n   Note that this configuration\
    \ is tantamount to removing all\n   centralized control of the scope configuration\
    \ of hosts on the\n   network.  This makes it possible for every User Agent to\
    \ see every\n   service.  This may not be desirable as users may not be able to\
    \ or\n   desire to decide which services are appropriate for them.\n"
- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   If a malicious host is able to insert fraudulent\
    \ information in\n   DHCPOFFER packets sent to a prospective SLP Agent then the\
    \ SLP Agent\n   will be unable to obtain service, or may unwittingly be directed\
    \ to\n   use the incorrect services.\n   Many opportunities for denial of service\
    \ exist.  A service agent\n   could find that it might rely on fraudulent or otherwise\
    \ malicious\n   directory agents to advertise its services.  DHCPOFFERs could\
    \ prevent\n   the regular SLP framework from functioning by directing clients\
    \ to\n   not use multicast, to use nonexistent directory agents and so on.\n \
    \  These difficulties are inherited from the much larger and more\n   serious\
    \ problem, viz.  securing or authenticating any information\n   whatsoever from\
    \ a DHCP server (or client!)  is not possible in common\n   DHCP deployments.\n"
