- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The RFC for Pre-Shared Key (PSK) based Transport Layer Security\
    \ (TLS)\n   [TLS-PSK] specifies ciphersuites for supporting TLS using pre-shared\n\
    \   symmetric keys.  However, all the ciphersuites defined in [TLS-PSK]\n   require\
    \ encryption.  However there are cases when only authentication\n   and integrity\
    \ protection is required, and confidentiality is not\n   needed.  There are also\
    \ cases when confidentiality is not permitted -\n   e.g., for implementations\
    \ that must meet import restrictions in some\n   countries.  Even though no encryption\
    \ is used, these ciphersuites\n   support authentication of the client and server\
    \ to each other, and\n   message integrity.  This document augments [TLS-PSK]\
    \ by adding three\n   more ciphersuites (PSK, DHE_PSK, RSA_PSK) with authentication\
    \ and\n   integrity only - no encryption.  The reader is expected to become\n\
    \   familiar with [TLS-PSK] standards prior to studying this document.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Applicability Statement\n   The ciphersuites defined in this document are\
    \ intended for a rather\n   limited set of applications, usually involving only\
    \ a very small\n   number of clients and servers.  Even in such environments,\
    \ other\n   alternatives may be more appropriate.\n   If the main goal is to avoid\
    \ Public-key Infrastructures (PKIs),\n   another possibility worth considering\
    \ is using self-signed\n   certificates with public key fingerprints.  Instead\
    \ of manually\n   configuring a shared secret in, for instance, some configuration\n\
    \   file, a fingerprint (hash) of the other party's public key (or\n   certificate)\
    \ could be placed there instead.\n   It is also possible to use the Secure Remote\
    \ Password (SRP)\n   ciphersuites for shared secret authentication [SRP].  SRP\
    \ was\n   designed to be used with passwords, and it incorporates protection\n\
    \   against dictionary attacks.  However, it is computationally more\n   expensive\
    \ than the PSK ciphersuites in [TLS-PSK].\n"

- title: 3.  Cipher Usage
  contents:
  - "3.  Cipher Usage\n   The three new ciphersuites proposed here match the three\
    \ cipher\n   suites defined in [TLS-PSK], except that we define suites with null\n\
    \   encryption.\n   The ciphersuites defined here use the following options for\
    \ key\n   exchange and hash part of the protocol:\n   CipherSuite            \
    \         Key Exchange   Cipher      Hash\n   TLS_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA          \
    \ PSK            NULL        SHA\n   TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA       DHE_PSK \
    \       NULL        SHA\n   TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA       RSA_PSK        NULL\
    \        SHA\n   For the meaning of the terms PSK, please refer to section 1 in\
    \ [TLS-\n   PSK].  For the meaning of the terms DHE, RSA, and SHA, please refer\n\
    \   to appendixes A.5 and B in [TLS].\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   As with all schemes involving shared keys, special\
    \ care should be\n   taken to protect the shared values and to limit their exposure\
    \ over\n   time.  As this document augments [TLS-PSK], everything stated in its\n\
    \   Security Consideration section applies here.  In addition, as cipher\n   suites\
    \ defined here do not support confidentiality, care should be\n   taken not to\
    \ send sensitive information (such as passwords) over\n   connections protected\
    \ with one of the ciphersuites defined in this\n   document.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   This document defines three new ciphersuites whose\
    \ values are in the\n   TLS Cipher Suite registry defined in [TLS].\n   CipherSuite\
    \   TLS_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA      = { 0x00, 0x2C };\n   CipherSuite   TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA\
    \  = { 0x00, 0x2D };\n   CipherSuite   TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA  = { 0x00, 0x2E\
    \ };\n"
