  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group first\
    \ created a\n   framework for metric development in [RFC2330].  This framework\
    \ has\n   stood the test of time and enabled development of many fundamental\n\
    \   metrics.  It has been updated in the area of metric composition\n   [RFC5835]\
    \ and in several areas related to active stream measurement\n   of modern networks\
    \ with reactive properties [RFC7312].\n   The IPPM framework [RFC2330] recognized\
    \ (in Section 13) that many\n   aspects of an IP packet can influence its processing\
    \ during transfer\n   across the network.\n   In Section 15 of [RFC2330], the\
    \ notion of a \"standard-formed\" packet\n   is defined.  However, the definition\
    \ was never expanded to include\n   IPv6, even though the authors of [RFC2330]\
    \ explicitly identified the\n   need for this update in Section 15: \"the version\
    \ field is 4 (later,\n   we will expand this to include 6)\".\n   In particular,\
    \ IPv6 Extension Headers and protocols that use IPv6\n   header compression are\
    \ growing in use.  This memo seeks to provide\n   the needed updates to the original\
    \ definition in [RFC2330].\n"

- title: 3.  Scope
  contents:
  - "3.  Scope\n   The purpose of this memo is to expand the coverage of IPPM to include\n\
    \   IPv6, highlight additional aspects of test packets, and make them\n   part\
    \ of the IPPM framework.\n   The scope is to update key sections of [RFC2330],\
    \ adding\n   considerations that will aid the development of new measurement\n\
    \   methodologies intended for today's IP networks.  Specifically, this\n   memo\
    \ expands the Type-P examples in Section 13 of [RFC2330] and\n   expands the definition\
    \ (in Section 15 of [RFC2330]) of a standard-\n   formed packet to include IPv6\
    \ header aspects and other features.\n   Other topics in [RFC2330] that might\
    \ be updated or augmented are\n   deferred to future work.  This includes the\
    \ topics of passive and\n   various forms of hybrid active/passive measurements.\n"
- title: 4.  Packets of Type-P
  contents:
  - "4.  Packets of Type-P\n   A fundamental property of many Internet metrics is\
    \ that the measured\n   value of the metric depends on characteristics of the\
    \ IP packet(s)\n   used to make the measurement.  Potential influencing factors\
    \ include\n   IP header fields and their values, as well as higher-layer protocol\n\
    \   headers and their values.  Consider an IP-connectivity metric: one\n   obtains\
    \ different results depending on whether one is interested in,\n   for example,\
    \ connectivity for packets destined for well-known TCP\n   ports or unreserved\
    \ UDP ports, those with invalid IPv4 checksums, or\n   those with TTL or Hop Limit\
    \ of 16.  In some circumstances, these\n   distinctions will result in special\
    \ treatment of packets in\n   intermediate nodes and end systems -- for example,\
    \ if Diffserv\n   [RFC2474], Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC3168],\
    \ Router\n   Alert [RFC6398], Hop-by-Hop extensions [RFC7045], or Flow Labels\n\
    \   [RFC6437] are used, or in the presence of firewalls or RSVP\n   reservations.\n\
    \   Because of this distinction, we introduce the generic notion of a\n   \"packet\
    \ of Type-P\", where in some contexts P will be explicitly\n   defined (i.e.,\
    \ exactly what type of packet we mean), partially\n   defined (e.g., \"with a\
    \ payload of B octets\"), or left generic.  Thus,\n   we may talk about generic\
    \ IP-Type-P-connectivity or more specific\n   IP-port-HTTP-connectivity.  Some\
    \ metrics and methodologies may be\n   fruitfully defined using generic Type-P\
    \ definitions, which are then\n   made specific when performing actual measurements.\n\
    \   Whenever a metric's value depends on the type of the packets\n   involved,\
    \ the metric's name will include either a specific type or a\n   phrase such as\
    \ \"Type-P\".  Thus, we will not define an\n   \"IP-connectivity\" metric but\
    \ instead an \"IP-Type-P-connectivity\"\n   metric and/or perhaps an \"IP-port-HTTP-connectivity\"\
    \ metric.  This\n   naming convention serves as an important reminder that one\
    \ must be\n   conscious of the exact type of traffic being measured.\n   If the\
    \ information constituting Type-P at the Source is found to have\n   changed at\
    \ the Destination (or at a measurement point between the\n   Source and Destination,\
    \ as in [RFC5644]), then the modified values\n   MUST be noted and reported with\
    \ the results.  Some modifications\n   occur according to the conditions encountered\
    \ in transit (such as\n   congestion notification) or due to the requirements\
    \ of segments of\n   the Source-to-Destination path.  For example, the packet\
    \ length will\n   change if IP headers are converted to the alternate version/address\n\
    \   family or optional Extension Headers are added or removed.  Even\n   header\
    \ fields like TTL/Hop Limit that typically change in transit may\n   be relevant\
    \ to specific tests.  For example, Neighbor Discovery\n   Protocol (NDP) [RFC4861]\
    \ packets are transmitted with the Hop Limit\n   value set to 255, and the validity\
    \ test specifies that the Hop Limit\n   MUST have a value of 255 at the receiver,\
    \ too.  So, while other tests\n   may intentionally exclude the TTL/Hop Limit\
    \ value from their Type-P\n   definition, for this particular test, the correct\
    \ Hop Limit value is\n   of high relevance and MUST be part of the Type-P definition.\n\
    \   Local policies in intermediate nodes based on examination of IPv6\n   Extension\
    \ Headers may affect measurement repeatability.  If\n   intermediate nodes follow\
    \ the recommendations of [RFC7045],\n   repeatability may be improved to some\
    \ degree.\n   A closely related note: It would be very useful to know if a given\n\
    \   Internet component (like a host, link, or path) treats equally a\n   class\
    \ C of different types of packets.  If so, then any one of those\n   types of\
    \ packets can be used for subsequent measurement of the\n   component.  This suggests\
    \ we should devise a metric or suite of\n   metrics that attempt to determine\
    \ class C (a designation that has no\n   relationship to address assignments,\
    \ of course).\n   Load-balancing over parallel paths is one particular example\
    \ where\n   such a class C would be more complex to determine in IPPM\n   measurements.\
    \  Load balancers and routers often use flow identifiers,\n   computed as hashes\
    \ (of specific parts) of the packet header, for\n   deciding among the available\
    \ parallel paths a packet will traverse.\n   Packets with identical hashes are\
    \ assigned to the same flow and\n   forwarded to the same resource in the load\
    \ balancer's (or router's)\n   pool.  The presence of a load balancer on the measurement\
    \ path, as\n   well as the specific headers and fields that are used for the\n\
    \   forwarding decision, are not known when measuring the path as a black\n  \
    \ box.  Potential assessment scenarios include the measurement of one\n   of the\
    \ parallel paths, and the measurement of all available parallel\n   paths that\
    \ the load balancer can use.  Therefore, knowledge of a load\n   balancer's flow\
    \ definition (alternatively, its class-C-specific\n   treatment in terms of header\
    \ fields in scope of hash operations) is a\n   prerequisite for repeatable measurements.\
    \  A path may have more than\n   one stage of load-balancing, adding to class\
    \ C definition complexity.\n"
- title: 5.  Standard-Formed Packets
  contents:
  - "5.  Standard-Formed Packets\n   Unless otherwise stated, all metric definitions\
    \ that concern IP\n   packets include an implicit assumption that the packet is\
    \ standard-\n   formed.  A packet is standard-formed if it meets all of the following\n\
    \   REQUIRED criteria:\n   +  It includes a valid IP header.  See below for version-specific\n\
    \      criteria.\n   +  It is not an IP fragment.\n   +  The Source and Destination\
    \ addresses correspond to the intended\n      Source and Destination, including\
    \ Multicast Destination addresses.\n   +  If a transport header is present, it\
    \ contains a valid checksum and\n      other valid fields.\n   For an IPv4 packet\
    \ (as specified in [RFC791] and the RFCs that update\n   it) to be standard-formed,\
    \ the following additional criteria are\n   REQUIRED:\n   o  The version field\
    \ is 4.\n   o  The Internet Header Length (IHL) value is >= 5; the checksum is\n\
    \      correct.\n   o  Its total length as given in the IPv4 header corresponds\
    \ to the\n      size of the IPv4 header plus the size of the payload.\n   o  Either\
    \ the packet possesses sufficient TTL to travel from the\n      Source to the\
    \ Destination if the TTL is decremented by one at each\n      hop or it possesses\
    \ the maximum TTL of 255.\n   o  It does not contain IP options unless explicitly\
    \ noted.\n   For an IPv6 packet (as specified in [RFC8200] and any future updates)\n\
    \   to be standard-formed, the following criteria are REQUIRED:\n   o  The version\
    \ field is 6.\n   o  Its total length corresponds to the size of the IPv6 header\
    \ (40\n      octets) plus the length of the payload as given in the IPv6\n   \
    \   header.\n   o  The payload length value for this packet (including Extension\n\
    \      Headers) conforms to the IPv6 specifications.\n   o  Either the packet\
    \ possesses sufficient Hop Limit to travel from\n      the Source to the Destination\
    \ if the Hop Limit is decremented by\n      one at each hop or it possesses the\
    \ maximum Hop Limit of 255.\n   o  Either the packet does not contain IP Extension\
    \ Headers or it\n      contains the correct number and type of headers as specified\
    \ in\n      the packet and the headers appear in the standard-conforming order\n\
    \      (Next Header).\n   o  All parameters used in the header and Extension Headers\
    \ are found\n      in the \"Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Parameters\" registry\n\
    \      specified in [IANA-6P].\n   Two mechanisms require some discussion in the\
    \ context of standard-\n   formed packets, namely IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless\
    \ Area Networks\n   (6LowPAN) [RFC4944] and Robust Header Compression (ROHC) [RFC3095].\n\
    \   6LowPAN, as defined in [RFC4944] and updated by [RFC6282] with header\n  \
    \ compression and [RFC6775] with neighbor discovery optimizations,\n   proposes\
    \ solutions for using IPv6 in resource-constrained\n   environments.  An adaptation\
    \ layer enables the transfer of IPv6\n   packets over networks having an MTU smaller\
    \ than the minimum IPv6\n   MTU.  Fragmentation and reassembly of IPv6 packets,\
    \ as well as the\n   resulting state that would be stored in intermediate nodes,\
    \ poses\n   substantial challenges to measurements.  Likewise, ROHC operates\n\
    \   statefully in compressing headers on subpaths, storing state in\n   intermediate\
    \ hosts.  The modification of measurement packets' Type-P\n   by ROHC and 6LowPAN\
    \ requires substantial work, as do requirements\n   with respect to the concept\
    \ of standard-formed packets for these two\n   protocols.  For these reasons,\
    \ we consider ROHC and 6LowPAN packets\n   to be out of the scope of the standard-formed\
    \ packet evaluation.\n   The topic of IPv6 Extension Headers brings current controversies\
    \ into\n   focus, as noted by [RFC6564] and [RFC7045].  However, measurement use\n\
    \   cases in the context of the IPPM framework, such as in situ OAM\n   [IOAM-DATA]\
    \ in enterprise environments, can benefit from inspection,\n   modification, addition,\
    \ or deletion of IPv6 extension headers in\n   hosts along the measurement path.\n\
    \   [RFC8250] endorses the use of the IPv6 Destination Option for\n   measurement\
    \ purposes, consistent with other relevant and approved\n   IETF specifications.\n\
    \   The following additional considerations apply when IPv6 Extension\n   Headers\
    \ are present:\n   o  Extension Header inspection: Some intermediate nodes may\
    \ inspect\n      Extension Headers or the entire IPv6 packet while in transit.\
    \  In\n      exceptional cases, they may drop the packet or route via a\n    \
    \  suboptimal path, and measurements may be unreliable or\n      unrepeatable.\
    \  The packet (if it arrives) may be standard-formed,\n      with a corresponding\
    \ Type-P.\n   o  Extension Header modification: In Hop-by-Hop headers, some TLV-\n\
    \      encoded options may be permitted to change at intermediate nodes\n    \
    \  while in transit.  The resulting packet may be standard-formed,\n      with\
    \ a corresponding Type-P.\n   o  Extension Header insertion or deletion: Although\
    \ such behavior is\n      not endorsed by current standards, it is possible that\
    \ Extension\n      Headers could be added to, or removed from, the header chain.\
    \  The\n      resulting packet may be standard-formed, with a corresponding\n\
    \      Type-P.  This point simply encourages measurement system designers\n  \
    \    to be prepared for the unexpected and notify users when such\n      events\
    \ occur.  There are issues with Extension Header insertion\n      and deletion,\
    \ of course, such as exceeding the path MTU due to\n      insertion, etc.\n  \
    \ o  A change in packet length (from the corresponding packet observed\n     \
    \ at the Source) or header modification is a significant factor in\n      Internet\
    \ measurement and REQUIRES a new Type-P to be reported with\n      the test results.\n\
    \   It is further REQUIRED that if a packet is described as having a\n   \"length\
    \ of B octets\", then 0 <= B <= 65535; and if B is the payload\n   length in octets,\
    \ then B <= (65535-IP header size in octets,\n   including any Extension Headers).\
    \  The jumbograms defined in\n   [RFC2675] are not covered by the above length\
    \ analysis, but if the\n   IPv6 Jumbogram Payload Hop-by-Hop Option Header is\
    \ present, then a\n   packet with corresponding length MUST be considered standard-formed.\n\
    \   In practice, the path MTU will restrict the length of standard-formed\n  \
    \ packets that can successfully traverse the path.  Path MTU Discovery\n   for\
    \ IP version 6 (PMTUD, [RFC8201]) or Packetization Layer Path MTU\n   Discovery\
    \ (PLPMTUD, [RFC4821]) is recommended to prevent\n   fragmentation.\n   So, for\
    \ example, one might imagine defining an IP-connectivity metric\n   as \"IP-Type-P-connectivity\
    \ for standard-formed packets with the IP\n   Diffserv field set to 0\", or, more\
    \ succinctly,\n   \"IP-Type-P-connectivity with the IP Diffserv field set to 0\"\
    , since\n   standard-formed is already implied by convention.  Changing the\n\
    \   contents of a field, such as the Diffserv Code Point, ECN bits, or\n   Flow\
    \ Label may have a profound effect on packet handling during\n   transit, but\
    \ does not affect a packet's status as standard-formed.\n   Likewise, the addition,\
    \ modification, or deletion of extension\n   headers may change the handling of\
    \ packets in transit hosts.\n   [RFC2330] defines the \"minimal IP packet from\
    \ A to B\" as a particular\n   type of standard-formed packet often useful to\
    \ consider.  When\n   defining IP metrics, no packet smaller or simpler than this\
    \ can be\n   transmitted over a correctly operating IP network.  However, the\n\
    \   concept of the minimal IP packet has not been employed (since typical\n  \
    \ active measurement systems employ a transport layer and a payload),\n   and\
    \ its practical use is limited.  Therefore, this memo deprecates\n   the concept\
    \ of the \"minimal IP packet from A to B\".\n"
- title: 6.  NAT, IPv4-IPv6 Transition, and Compression Techniques
  contents:
  - "6.  NAT, IPv4-IPv6 Transition, and Compression Techniques\n   This memo adds\
    \ the key considerations for utilizing IPv6 in two\n   critical conventions of\
    \ the IPPM framework, namely packets of Type-P\n   and standard-formed packets.\
    \  The need for coexistence of IPv4 and\n   IPv6 has originated transitioning\
    \ standards like the framework for\n   IPv4/IPv6 translation in [RFC6144] or the\
    \ IP/ICMP translation\n   algorithms in [RFC7915] and [RFC7757].\n   The definition\
    \ and execution of measurements within the context of\n   the IPPM framework is\
    \ challenged whenever such translation mechanisms\n   are present along the measurement\
    \ path.  In use cases like IPv4-IPv6\n   translation, NAT, protocol encapsulation,\
    \ or IPv6 header compression\n   may result in modification of the measurement\
    \ packet's Type-P along\n   the path.  All these changes MUST be reported.  Example\
    \ consequences\n   include, but are not limited to:\n   o  Modification or addition\
    \ of headers or header field values in\n      intermediate nodes.  IPv4-IPv6 transitioning\
    \ or IPv6 header\n      compression mechanisms may result in changes of the measurement\n\
    \      packets' Type-P, too.  Consequently, hosts along the measurement\n    \
    \  path may treat packets differently because of the Type-P\n      modification.\
    \  Measurements at observation points along the path\n      may also need extra\
    \ context to uniquely identify a packet.\n   o  Network Address Translators (NAT)\
    \ on the path can have an\n      unpredictable impact on latency measurement (in\
    \ terms of the\n      amount of additional time added) and possibly other types\
    \ of\n      measurements.  It is not usually possible to control this impact\n\
    \      as testers may not have any control of the underlying network or\n    \
    \  middleboxes.  There is a possibility that stateful NAT will lead\n      to\
    \ unstable performance for a flow with specific Type-P, since\n      state needs\
    \ to be created for the first packet of a flow and state\n      may be lost later\
    \ if the NAT runs out of resources.  However, this\n      scenario does not invalidate\
    \ the Type-P for testing; for example,\n      the purpose of a test might be exactly\
    \ to quantify the NAT's\n      impact on delay variation.  The presence of NAT\
    \ may mean that the\n      measured performance of Type-P will change between\
    \ the source and\n      the destination.  This can cause an issue when attempting\
    \ to\n      correlate measurements conducted on segments of the path that\n  \
    \    include or exclude the NAT.  Thus, it is a factor to be aware of\n      when\
    \ conducting measurements.\n   o  Variable delay due to internal state.  One side\
    \ effect of changes\n      due to IPv4-IPv6 transitioning mechanisms is the variable\
    \ delay\n      that intermediate nodes experience for header modifications.\n\
    \      Similar to NAT, the allocation of internal state and establishment\n  \
    \    of context within intermediate nodes may cause variable delays,\n      depending\
    \ on the measurement stream pattern and position of a\n      packet within the\
    \ stream.  For example, the first packet in a\n      stream will typically trigger\
    \ allocation of internal state in an\n      intermediate IPv4-IPv6 transition\
    \ host.  Subsequent packets can\n      benefit from lower processing delay due\
    \ to the existing internal\n      state.  However, large interpacket delays in\
    \ the measurement\n      stream may result in the intermediate host deleting the\
    \ associated\n      state and needing to re-establish it on arrival of another\
    \ stream\n      packet.  It is worth noting that this variable delay due to\n\
    \      internal state allocation in intermediate nodes can be an explicit\n  \
    \    use case for measurements.\n   o  Variable delay due to packet length.  IPv4-IPv6\
    \ transitioning or\n      header compression mechanisms modify the length of measurement\n\
    \      packets.  The modification of the packet size may or may not\n      change\
    \ how the measurement path treats the packets.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations that apply to any\
    \ active measurement of\n   live paths are relevant here as well.  See [RFC4656]\
    \ and [RFC5357].\n   When considering the privacy of those involved in measurement\
    \ or\n   those whose traffic is measured, the sensitive information available\n\
    \   to potential observers is greatly reduced when using active\n   techniques\
    \ that are within this scope of work.  Passive observations\n   of user traffic\
    \ for measurement purposes raise many privacy issues.\n   We refer the reader\
    \ to the privacy considerations described in the\n   Large Scale Measurement of\
    \ Broadband Performance (LMAP) framework\n   [RFC7594], which covers active and\
    \ passive techniques.\n"
