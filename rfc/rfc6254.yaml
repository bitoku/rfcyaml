- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   RFC 2754 requested that each time IANA made an address assignment,\
    \ it\n   was to create appropriate inetnum and as-block objects and digitally\n\
    \   sign them.  The purpose was to distribute the IANA-held public key in\n  \
    \ software implementations of the Distributed Routing Policy System.\n   In practice,\
    \ this was never done on the public Internet.  This\n   document requests that\
    \ RFC 2754 be moved to Historic status.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) (www.iana.org)\
    \ is\n   charged with allocating parameter values for fields in protocols that\n\
    \   have been designed, created, or are maintained by the Internet\n   Engineering\
    \ Task Force (IETF).  RFC 2754 [RFC2754] requests that the\n   IANA create a repository\
    \ of Routing Policy Specification Language\n   (RPSL) objects and digitally sign\
    \ them.  The RFC identifies the\n   initial objects to be signed and also requests\
    \ that each time IANA\n   makes an address assignment it also create new objects\
    \ as needed and\n   sign them as well.  In practice, this was never done in the\
    \ public\n   Internet.  During a detailed review of IANA's protocol registration\n\
    \   activities in support of the IETF, this request for IANA action was\n   identified\
    \ as one of those that had not been completed after\n   publication of the RFC.\n\
    \   This document obsoletes RFC 2754 [RFC2754], recommends that it be\n   moved\
    \ to Historic status, and directs IANA not to move forward with\n   the IANA actions\
    \ in that RFC.\n"
- title: 2.  Details
  contents:
  - "2.  Details\n   RFC 2754 [RFC2754] requests that the IANA create a repository\
    \ of RPSL\n   objects and digitally sign them.  The RFC identifies the initial\n\
    \   objects to be signed and also requests that each time IANA makes an\n   address\
    \ assignment it also create new objects as needed and sign them\n   as well.\n\
    \   During a review of RFCs in 2009, it became apparent that the IANA\n   actions\
    \ requested in RFC 2754 were never done.  In the intervening\n   time, another\
    \ technology appears to be taking the role once\n   envisioned for Distributed\
    \ RPSL.  Both an architecture and\n   infrastructure now exist for secure routing\
    \ using Resource Public Key\n   Infrastructure (RPKI) technologies.  As an example,\
    \ the semantics of\n   a Route Origin Authorization (ROA) -- an application of\
    \ the RPKI --\n   to validate the origination of routes has been standardized\
    \ by\n   the IETF.\n   Implementation of the IANA actions in RFC 2754 would now\
    \ require\n   significant implementation complexity.  In the face of alternative\n\
    \   technology, and given that the requested actions have not been\n   implemented\
    \ in the public Internet, it is proposed to reclassify\n   RFC 2754 [RFC2754]\
    \ as Historic and to direct the IANA not to pursue\n   or implement the IANA requests\
    \ in that document.\n"
- title: 3.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "3.  Terminology\n   The word \"allocation\" designates a block of addresses managed\
    \ by a\n   registry for the purpose of making assignments and allocations.  The\n\
    \   word \"assignment\" designates a block of addresses, or a single\n   address,\
    \ registered to an end-user for use on a specific network, or\n   set of networks.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA is instructed not to pursue or implement the\
    \ IANA actions\n   requested in RFC 2754 [RFC2754].\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The intended signature of inetnum and as-block\
    \ objects never took\n   place in the public Internet.  Moving RFC 2754 [RFC2754]\
    \ to Historic\n   status would have no known impact on the security of the Internet.\n"
