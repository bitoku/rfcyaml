    \  The \"ldap\" prefix indicates an entry or entries accessible from the\n   LDAP
    server running on the given hostname at the given portnumber.\n   Note that the
    <host> may contain literal IPv6 addresses as specified\n   in Section 3.2.2 of
    [RFC3986].\n   The <dn> is an LDAP Distinguished Name using the string format\n
    \  described in [RFC4514].  It identifies the base object of the LDAP\n   search
    or the target of a non-search operation.\n   The <attributes> construct is used
    to indicate which attributes\n   should be returned from the entry or entries.\n
    \  The <scope> construct is used to specify the scope of the search to\n   perform
    in the given LDAP server.  The allowable scopes are \"base\"\n   for a base object
    search, \"one\" for a one-level search, or \"sub\" for\n   a subtree search.\n
    \  The <filter> is used to specify the search filter to apply to entries\n   within
    the specified scope during the search.  It has the format\n   specified in [RFC4515].\n
    \  The <extensions> construct provides the LDAP URL with an\n   extensibility
    mechanism, allowing the capabilities of the URL to be\n   extended in the future.
    \ Extensions are a simple comma-separated list\n   of type=value pairs, where
    the =value portion MAY be omitted for\n   options not requiring it.  Each type=value
    pair is a separate\n   extension.  These LDAP URL extensions are not necessarily
    related to\n   any of the LDAP extension mechanisms.  Extensions may be supported
    or\n   unsupported by the client resolving the URL.  An extension prefixed\n   with
    a '!' character (ASCII 0x21) is critical.  An extension not\n   prefixed with
    a '!' character is non-critical.\n   If an LDAP URL extension is implemented (that
    is, if the\n   implementation understands it and is able to use it), the\n   implementation
    MUST make use of it.  If an extension is not\n   implemented and is marked critical,
    the implementation MUST NOT\n   process the URL.  If an extension is not implemented
    and is not\n   marked critical, the implementation MUST ignore the extension.\n
    \  The extension type (<extype>) MAY be specified using the numeric OID\n   <numericoid>
    form (e.g., 1.2.3.4) or the descriptor <descr> form\n   (e.g., myLDAPURLExtension).
    \ Use of the <descr> form SHOULD be\n   restricted to registered object identifier
    descriptive names.  See\n   [RFC4520] for registration details and usage guidelines
    for\n   descriptive names.\n   No LDAP URL extensions are defined in this document.
    \ Other documents\n   or a future version of this document MAY define one or more\n
    \  extensions.\n"

    - "2.1.  Percent-Encoding\n   A generated LDAP URL MUST consist only of the restricted
      set of\n   characters included in one of the following three productions defined\n
      \  in [RFC3986]:\n         <reserved>\n         <unreserved>\n         <pct-encoded>\n
      \  Implementations SHOULD accept other valid UTF-8 strings [RFC3629] as\n   input.
      \ An octet MUST be encoded using the percent-encoding mechanism\n   described
      in section 2.1 of [RFC3986] in any of these situations:\n      The octet is
      not in the reserved set defined in section 2.2 of\n      [RFC3986] or in the
      unreserved set defined in section 2.3 of\n      [RFC3986].\n      It is the
      single Reserved character '?' and occurs inside a <dn>,\n      <filter>, or
      other element of an LDAP URL.\n      It is a comma character ',' that occurs
      inside an <exvalue>.\n   Note that before the percent-encoding mechanism is
      applied, the\n   extensions component of the LDAP URL may contain one or more
      null\n   (zero) bytes.  No other component may.\n"

  - "3.  Defaults for Fields of the LDAP URL\n   Some fields of the LDAP URL are optional,
    as described above.  In the\n   absence of any other specification, the following
    general defaults\n   SHOULD be used when a field is absent.  Note that other documents
    MAY\n   specify different defaulting rules; for example, section 4.1.10 of\n   [RFC4511]
    specifies a different rule for determining the correct DN\n   to use when it is
    absent in an LDAP URL that is returned as a\n   referral.\n   <host>\n      If
    no <host> is given, the client must have some a priori\n      knowledge of an
    appropriate LDAP server to contact.\n   <port>\n      The default LDAP port is
    TCP port 389.\n   <dn>\n      If no <dn> is given, the default is the zero-length
    DN, \"\".\n   <attributes>\n      If the <attributes> part is omitted, all user
    attributes of the\n      entry or entries should be requested (e.g., by setting
    the\n      attributes field AttributeDescriptionList in the LDAP search\n      request
    to a NULL list, or by using the special <alluserattrs>\n      selector \"*\").\n
    \  <scope>\n      If <scope> is omitted, a <scope> of \"base\" is assumed.\n   <filter>\n
    \     If <filter> is omitted, a filter of \"(objectClass=*)\" is assumed.\n   <extensions>\n
    \     If <extensions> is omitted, no extensions are assumed.\n"

  - "4.  Examples\n   The following are some example LDAP URLs that use the format
    defined\n   above.  The first example is an LDAP URL referring to the University\n
    \  of Michigan entry, available from an LDAP server of the client's\n   choosing:\n
    \     ldap:///o=University%20of%20Michigan,c=US\n   The next example is an LDAP
    URL referring to the University of\n   Michigan entry in a particular ldap server:\n
    \     ldap://ldap1.example.net/o=University%20of%20Michigan,c=US\n   Both of these
    URLs correspond to a base object search of the\n   \"o=University of Michigan,c=US\"
    entry using a filter of\n   \"(objectclass=*)\", requesting all attributes.\n
    \  The next example is an LDAP URL referring to only the postalAddress\n   attribute
    of the University of Michigan entry:\n      ldap://ldap1.example.net/o=University%20of%20Michigan,\n
    \            c=US?postalAddress\n   The corresponding LDAP search operation is
    the same as in the\n   previous example, except that only the postalAddress attribute
    is\n   requested.\n   The next example is an LDAP URL referring to the set of
    entries found\n   by querying the given LDAP server on port 6666 and doing a subtree\n
    \  search of the University of Michigan for any entry with a common name\n   of
    \"Babs Jensen\", retrieving all attributes:\n      ldap://ldap1.example.net:6666/o=University%20of%20Michigan,\n
    \            c=US??sub?(cn=Babs%20Jensen)\n   The next example is an LDAP URL
    referring to all children of the c=GB\n   entry:\n      LDAP://ldap1.example.com/c=GB?objectClass?ONE\n
    \  The objectClass attribute is requested to be returned along with the\n   entries,
    and the default filter of \"(objectclass=*)\" is used.\n   The next example is
    an LDAP URL to retrieve the mail attribute for\n   the LDAP entry named \"o=Question?,c=US\",
    illustrating the use of the\n   percent-encoding mechanism on the reserved character
    '?'.\n      ldap://ldap2.example.com/o=Question%3f,c=US?mail\n   The next example
    (which is broken into two lines for readability)\n   illustrates the interaction
    between the LDAP string representation of\n   the filters-quoting mechanism and
    the URL-quoting mechanisms.\n      ldap://ldap3.example.com/o=Babsco,c=US\n              ???(four-octet=%5c00%5c00%5c00%5c04)\n
    \  The filter in this example uses the LDAP escaping mechanism of \\ to\n   encode
    three zero or null bytes in the value.  In LDAP, the filter\n   would be written
    as (four-octet=\\00\\00\\00\\04).  Because the \\\n   character must be escaped
    in a URL, the \\s are percent-encoded as %5c\n   (or %5C) in the URL encoding.\n
    \  The next example illustrates the interaction between the LDAP string\n   representation
    of the DNs-quoting mechanism and URL-quoting\n   mechanisms.\n      ldap://ldap.example.com/o=An%20Example%5C2C%20Inc.,c=US\n
    \  The DN encoded in the above URL is:\n      o=An Example\\2C Inc.,c=US\n   That
    is, the left-most RDN value is:\n      An Example, Inc.\n   The following three
    URLs are equivalent, assuming that the defaulting\n   rules specified in Section
    3 of this document are used:\n      ldap://ldap.example.net\n      ldap://ldap.example.net/\n
    \     ldap://ldap.example.net/?\n   These three URLs point to the root DSE on
    the ldap.example.net\n   server.\n   The final two examples show use of a hypothetical,
    experimental bind\n   name extension (the value associated with the extension
    is an LDAP\n   DN).\n      ldap:///??sub??e-bindname=cn=Manager%2cdc=example%2cdc=com\n
    \     ldap:///??sub??!e-bindname=cn=Manager%2cdc=example%2cdc=com\n   The two
    URLs are the same, except that the second one marks the\n   e-bindname extension
    as critical.  Notice the use of the percent-\n   encoding mechanism to encode
    the commas within the distinguished name\n   value in the e-bindname extension.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The general URL security considerations discussed
    in [RFC3986] are\n   relevant for LDAP URLs.\n   The use of security mechanisms
    when processing LDAP URLs requires\n   particular care, since clients may encounter
    many different servers\n   via URLs, and since URLs are likely to be processed
    automatically,\n   without user intervention.  A client SHOULD have a user-configurable\n
    \  policy that controls which servers the client will establish LDAP\n   sessions
    with and with which security mechanisms, and SHOULD NOT\n   establish LDAP sessions
    that are inconsistent with this policy.  If a\n   client chooses to reuse an existing
    LDAP session when resolving one\n   or more LDAP URLs, it MUST ensure that the
    session is compatible with\n   the URL and that no security policies are violated.\n
    \  Sending authentication information, no matter the mechanism, may\n   violate
    a user's privacy requirements.  In the absence of specific\n   policy permitting
    authentication information to be sent to a server,\n   a client should use an
    anonymous LDAP session.  (Note that clients\n   conforming to previous LDAP URL
    specifications, where all LDAP\n   sessions are anonymous and unprotected, are
    consistent with this\n   specification; they simply have the default security
    policy.)  Simply\n   opening a transport connection to another server may violate
    some\n   users' privacy requirements, so clients should provide the user with\n
    \  a way to control URL processing.\n   Some authentication methods, in particular,
    reusable passwords sent\n   to the server, may reveal easily-abused information
    to the remote\n   server or to eavesdroppers in transit and should not be used
    in URL\n   processing unless they are explicitly permitted by policy.\n   Confirmation
    by the human user of the use of authentication\n   information is appropriate
    in many circumstances.  Use of strong\n   authentication methods that do not reveal
    sensitive information is\n   much preferred.  If the URL represents a referral
    for an update\n   operation, strong authentication methods SHOULD be used.  Please\n
    \  refer to the Security Considerations section of [RFC4513] for more\n   information.\n
    \  The LDAP URL format allows the specification of an arbitrary LDAP\n   search
    operation to be performed when evaluating the LDAP URL.\n   Following an LDAP
    URL may cause unexpected results, for example, the\n   retrieval of large amounts
    of data or the initiation of a long-lived\n   search.  The security implications
    of resolving an LDAP URL are the\n   same as those of resolving an LDAP search
    query.\n"

      used inside the <host> portion of\n   the URL, and a note was added to remind
      the reader of this\n   enhancement).  Referencing [RFC3986] required changes
      to the ABNF and\n   text so that productions that are no longer defined by [RFC3986]
      are\n   not used.  For example, <hostport> is not defined by [RFC3986] so it\n
      \  has been replaced with host [COLON port].  Note that [RFC3986]\n   includes
      new definitions for the \"Reserved\" and \"Unreserved\" sets of\n   characters,
      and the net result is that the following two additional\n   characters should
      be percent-encoded when they appear anywhere in the\n   data used to construct
      an LDAP URL: \"[\" and \"]\" (these two characters\n   were first added to the
      Reserved set by RFC 2732).\n   Changed the definition of <attrdesc> to refer
      to <attributeSelector>\n   from [RFC4511].  This allows the use of \"*\" in
      the <attrdesc> part of\n   the URL.  It is believed that existing implementations
      of RFC 2255\n   already support this.\n   Avoided use of <prose-val> (bracketed-string)
      productions in the\n   <dn>, <host>, <attrdesc>, and <exvalue> rules.\n   Changed
      the ABNF for <ldapurl> to group the <dn> component with the\n   preceding <SLASH>.\n
      \  Changed the <extype> rule to be an <oid> from [RFC4512].\n   Changed the
      text about extension types so it references [RFC4520].\n   Reordered rules to
      more closely follow the order in which the\n   elements appear in the URL.\n
      \  \"Bindname Extension\": removed due to lack of known implementations.\n"
    title: A.1.  Technical Changes
  - contents:
    - "A.2.  Editorial Changes\n   Changed document title to include \"LDAP:\" prefix.\n
      \  IESG Note: removed note about lack of satisfactory mandatory\n   authentication
      mechanisms.\n   \"Status of this Memo\" section: updated boilerplate to match
      current\n   I-D guidelines.\n   \"Abstract\" section: separated from introductory
      material.\n   \"Table of Contents\" and \"Intellectual Property\" sections:
      added.\n   \"Introduction\" section: new section; separated from the Abstract.\n
      \  Changed the text indicate that RFC 2255 is replaced by this document\n   (instead
      of RFC 1959).  Added text to indicate that LDAP URLs are\n   used for references
      and referrals.  Fixed typo (replaced the nonsense\n   phrase \"to perform to
      retrieve\" with \"used to retrieve\").  Added a\n   note to let the reader know
      that not all of the parameters of the\n   LDAP search operation described in
      [RFC4511] can be expressed using\n   this format.\n   \"URL Definition\" section:
      removed second copy of <ldapurl> grammar\n   and following two paragraphs (editorial
      error in RFC 2255).  Fixed\n   line break within '!' sequence.  Reformatted
      the ABNF to improve\n   readability by aligning comments and adding some blank
      lines.\n   Replaced \"residing in the LDAP server\" with \"accessible from the
      LDAP\n   server\" in the sentence immediately following the ABNF.  Removed the\n
      \  sentence \"Individual attrdesc names are as defined for\n   AttributeDescription
      in [RFC4511].\"  because [RFC4511]'s\n   <attributeSelector> is now used directly
      in the ABNF.  Reworded last\n   paragraph to clarify which characters must be
      percent-encoded.  Added\n   text to indicate that LDAP URLs are used for references
      and\n   referrals.  Added text that refers to the ABNF from RFC 4234.\n   Clarified
      and strengthened the requirements with respect to\n   processing of URLs that
      contain implemented and not implemented\n   extensions (the approach now closely
      matches that specified in\n   [RFC4511] for LDAP controls).\n   \"Defaults for
      Fields of the LDAP URL\" section: added; formed by\n   moving text about defaults
      out of the \"URL Definition\" section.\n   Replaced direct reference to the
      attribute name \"*\" with a reference\n   to the special <alluserattrs> selector
      \"*\" defined in [RFC4511].\n   \"URL Processing\" section: removed.\n   \"Examples\"
      section: Modified examples to use example.com and\n   example.net hostnames.
      \ Added missing '?' to the LDAP URL example\n   whose filter contains three
      null bytes.  Removed space after one\n   comma within a DN.  Revised the bindname
      example to use e-bindname.\n   Changed the name of an attribute used in one
      example from \"int\" to\n   \"four-octet\" to avoid potential confusion.  Added
      an example that\n   demonstrates the interaction between DN escaping and URL
      percent-\n   encoding.  Added some examples to show URL equivalence with respect\n
      \  to the <dn> portion of the URL.  Used uppercase in some examples to\n   remind
      the reader that some tokens are case-insensitive.\n   \"Security Considerations\"
      section: Added a note about connection\n   reuse.  Added a note about using
      strong authentication methods for\n   updates.  Added a reference to [RFC4513].
      \ Added note that simply\n   opening a connection may violate some users' privacy
      requirements.\n   Adopted the working group's revised LDAP terminology specification
      by\n   replacing the word \"connection\" with \"LDAP session\" or \"LDAP\n   connection\"
      as appropriate.\n   \"Acknowledgements\" section: added statement that this
      document\n   obsoletes RFC 2255.  Added Kurt Zeilenga, Jim Sermersheim, and\n
      \  Hallvard Furuseth.\n   \"Normative References\" section: renamed from \"References\"
      per new RFC\n   guidelines.  Changed from [1] style to [RFC4511] style throughout
      the\n   document.  Added references to RFC 4234 and RFC 3629.  Updated all\n
      \  RFC 1738 references to point to the appropriate sections within\n   [RFC3986].
      \ Updated the LDAP references to refer to LDAPBis WG\n   documents.  Removed
      the reference to the LDAP Attribute Syntaxes\n   document and added references
      to the [RFC4513], [RFC4520], and\n   [RFC4510] documents.\n   \"Informative
      References\" section: added.\n   Header and \"Authors' Addresses\" sections:
      added \"editor\" next to Mark\n   Smith's name.  Updated affiliation and contact
      information.\n   Copyright: updated the year.\n   Throughout the document: surrounded
      the names of all ABNF productions\n   with \"<\" and \">\" where they are used
      in descriptive text.\n"
