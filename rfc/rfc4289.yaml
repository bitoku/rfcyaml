- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Recent Internet protocols have been carefully designed to\
    \ be easily\n   extensible in certain areas.  In particular, MIME [RFC2045] is\
    \ an\n   open-ended framework and can accommodate additional object types,\n \
    \  charsets, and access methods without any changes to the basic\n   protocol.\
    \  A registration process is needed, however, to ensure that\n   the set of such\
    \ values is developed in an orderly, well-specified,\n   and public manner.\n\
    \   This document defines registration procedures that use the Internet\n   Assigned\
    \ Numbers Authority (IANA) as a central registry for these\n   values.\n   Note:\n\
    \      Registration of media types and charsets for use in MIME are\n      specified\
    \ in separate documents [RFC4288] [RFC2978] and are not\n      addressed here.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  External Body Access Types
  contents:
  - "2.  External Body Access Types\n   [RFC2046] defines the message/external-body\
    \ media type, whereby a\n   MIME entity can act as pointer to the actual body\
    \ data in lieu of\n   including the data directly in the entity body.  Each\n\
    \   message/external-body reference specifies an access type, which\n   determines\
    \ the mechanism used to retrieve the actual body data.  RFC\n   2046 defines an\
    \ initial set of access types but allows for the\n   registration of additional\
    \ access types to accommodate new retrieval\n   mechanisms.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Registration Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Registration Requirements\n   New access type specifications MUST conform\
    \ to the requirements\n   described below.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  Naming Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Naming Requirements\n   Each access type MUST have a unique name.  This\
    \ name appears in the\n   access-type parameter in the message/external-body content-type\n\
    \   header field and MUST conform to MIME content type parameter syntax.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  Mechanism Specification Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Mechanism Specification Requirements\n   All of the protocols, transports,\
    \ and procedures used by a given\n   access type MUST be described, either in\
    \ the specification of the\n   access type itself or in some other publicly available\
    \ specification,\n   in sufficient detail for the access type to be implemented\
    \ by any\n   competent implementor.  Use of secret and/or proprietary methods\
    \ in\n   access types is expressly prohibited.  The restrictions imposed by\n\
    \   [RFC2026] on the standardization of patented algorithms must be\n   respected\
    \ as well.\n"
- title: 2.1.3.  Publication Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.1.3.  Publication Requirements\n   All access types MUST be described by an\
    \ RFC.  The RFC may be\n   informational rather than standards-track, although\
    \ standards-track\n   review and approval are encouraged for all access types.\n"
- title: 2.1.4.  Security Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.1.4.  Security Requirements\n   Any known security issues that arise from the\
    \ use of the access type\n   MUST be completely and fully described.  It is not\
    \ required that the\n   access type be secure or that it be free from risks, but\
    \ it is\n   required that the known risks be identified.  Publication of a new\n\
    \   access type does not require an exhaustive security review, and the\n   security\
    \ considerations section is subject to continuing evaluation.\n   Additional security\
    \ considerations SHOULD be addressed by publishing\n   revised versions of the\
    \ access type specification.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Registration Procedure
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Registration Procedure\n   Registration of a new access type starts with\
    \ the publication of the\n   specification as an Internet Draft.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.  Present the Access Type to the Community
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Present the Access Type to the Community\n   A proposed access type specification\
    \ is sent to the\n   \"ietf-types@iana.org\" mailing list for a two-week review\
    \ period.\n   This mailing list has been established for the purpose of reviewing\n\
    \   proposed access and media types.  Proposed access types are not\n   formally\
    \ registered and must not be used.\n   The intent of the public posting is to\
    \ solicit comments and feedback\n   on the access type specification and a review\
    \ of any security\n   considerations.\n"
- title: 2.2.2.  Access Type Reviewer
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  Access Type Reviewer\n   When the two-week period has passed, the access\
    \ type reviewer, who is\n   appointed by the IETF Applications Area Director(s),\
    \ either forwards\n   the request to iana@iana.org or rejects it because of significant\n\
    \   objections raised on the list.\n   Decisions made by the reviewer must be\
    \ posted to the ietf-types\n   mailing list within 14 days.  Decisions made by\
    \ the reviewer may be\n   appealed to the IESG as specified in [RFC2026].\n"
- title: 2.2.3.  IANA Registration
  contents:
  - "2.2.3.  IANA Registration\n   Provided that the access type either has passed\
    \ review or has been\n   successfully appealed to the IESG, the IANA will register\
    \ the access\n   type and make the registration available to the community.  The\n\
    \   specification of the access type must also be published as an RFC.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Location of Registered Access Type List
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Location of Registered Access Type List\n   Access type registrations are\
    \ listed by the IANA on the following web\n   page:\n     http://www.iana.org/assignments/access-types\n"
- title: 2.4.  IANA Procedures for Registering Access Types
  contents:
  - "2.4.  IANA Procedures for Registering Access Types\n   The identity of the access\
    \ type reviewer is communicated to the IANA\n   by the IESG.  The IANA then only\
    \ acts either in response to access\n   type definitions that are approved by\
    \ the access type reviewer and\n   forwarded to the IANA for registration, or\
    \ in response to a\n   communication from the IESG that an access type definition\
    \ appeal has\n   overturned the access type reviewer's ruling.\n"
- title: 3.  Transfer Encodings
  contents:
  - "3.  Transfer Encodings\n   Transfer encodings are transformations applied to\
    \ MIME media types\n   after conversion to the media type's canonical form.  Transfer\n\
    \   encodings are used for several purposes:\n   o  Many transports, especially\
    \ message transports, can only handle\n      data consisting of relatively short\
    \ lines of text.  There can be\n      severe restrictions on what characters can\
    \ be used in these lines\n      of text.  Some transports are restricted to a\
    \ small subset of US-\n      ASCII, and others cannot handle certain character\
    \ sequences.\n      Transfer encodings are used to transform binary data into\
    \ a\n      textual form that can survive such transports.  Examples of this\n\
    \      sort of transfer encoding include the base64 and quoted-printable\n   \
    \   transfer encodings defined in [RFC2045].\n   o  Image, audio, video, and even\
    \ application entities are sometimes\n      quite large.  Compression algorithms\
    \ are often effective in\n      reducing the size of large entities.  Transfer\
    \ encodings can be\n      used to apply general-purpose non-lossy compression\
    \ algorithms to\n      MIME entities.\n   o  Transport encodings can be defined\
    \ as a means of representing\n      existing encoding formats in a MIME context.\n\
    \   IMPORTANT:  The standardization of a large number of different\n   transfer\
    \ encodings is seen as a significant barrier to widespread\n   interoperability\
    \ and is expressly discouraged.  Nevertheless, the\n   following procedure has\
    \ been defined in order to provide a means of\n   defining additional transfer\
    \ encodings, should standardization\n   actually be justified.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Transfer Encoding Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Transfer Encoding Requirements\n   Transfer encoding specifications MUST\
    \ conform to the requirements\n   described below.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Naming Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Naming Requirements\n   Each transfer encoding MUST have a unique name.\
    \  This name appears in\n   the Content-Transfer-Encoding header field and MUST\
    \ conform to the\n   syntax of that field.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  Algorithm Specification Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Algorithm Specification Requirements\n   All of the algorithms used in\
    \ a transfer encoding (e.g., conversion\n   to printable form, compression) MUST\
    \ be described in their entirety\n   in the transfer encoding specification. \
    \ Use of secret and/or\n   proprietary algorithms in standardized transfer encodings\
    \ is\n   expressly prohibited.  The restrictions imposed by [RFC2026] on the\n\
    \   standardization of patented algorithms MUST be respected as well.\n"
- title: 3.1.3.  Input Domain Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.1.3.  Input Domain Requirements\n   All transfer encodings MUST be applicable\
    \ to an arbitrary sequence of\n   octets of any length.  Dependence on particular\
    \ input forms is not\n   allowed.\n   It should be noted that the 7bit and 8bit\
    \ encodings do not conform to\n   this requirement.  Aside from the undesirability\
    \ of having\n   specialized encodings, the intent here is to forbid the addition\
    \ of\n   additional encodings similar to, or redundant with, 7bit and 8bit.\n"
- title: 3.1.4.  Output Range Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.1.4.  Output Range Requirements\n   There is no requirement that a particular\
    \ transfer encoding produce a\n   particular form of encoded output.  However,\
    \ the output format for\n   each transfer encoding MUST be fully and completely\
    \ documented.  In\n   particular, each specification MUST clearly state whether\
    \ the output\n   format always lies within the confines of 7bit or 8bit or is\
    \ simply\n   pure binary data.\n"
- title: 3.1.5.  Data Integrity and Generality Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.1.5.  Data Integrity and Generality Requirements\n   All transfer encodings\
    \ MUST be fully invertible on any platform; it\n   MUST be possible for anyone\
    \ to recover the original data by\n   performing the corresponding decoding operation.\
    \  Note that this\n   requirement effectively excludes all forms of lossy compression\
    \ as\n   well as all forms of encryption from use as a transfer encoding.\n"
- title: 3.1.6.  New Functionality Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.1.6.  New Functionality Requirements\n   All transfer encodings MUST provide\
    \ some sort of new functionality.\n   Some degree of functionality overlap with\
    \ previously defined transfer\n   encodings is acceptable, but any new transfer\
    \ encoding MUST also\n   offer something no other transfer encoding provides.\n"
- title: 3.1.7.  Security Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.1.7.  Security Requirements\n   To the greatest extent possible, transfer encodings\
    \ SHOULD NOT\n   contain known security issues.  Regardless, any known security\
    \ issues\n   that arise from the use of the transfer encoding MUST be completely\n\
    \   and fully described.  If additional security issues come to light\n   after\
    \ initial publication and registration, they SHOULD be addressed\n   by publishing\
    \ revised versions of the transfer encoding\n   specification.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Transfer Encoding Definition Procedure
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Transfer Encoding Definition Procedure\n   Definition of a new transfer\
    \ encoding starts with the publication of\n   the specification as an Internet\
    \ Draft.  The draft MUST define the\n   transfer encoding precisely and completely,\
    \ and it MUST also provide\n   substantial justification for defining and standardizing\
    \ a new\n   transfer encoding.  This specification MUST then be presented to the\n\
    \   IESG for consideration.  The IESG can:\n   o  reject the specification outright\
    \ as being inappropriate for\n      standardization,\n   o  assign the specification\
    \ to an existing IETF working group for\n      further work,\n   o  approve the\
    \ formation of an IETF working group to work on the\n      specification in accordance\
    \ with IETF procedures, or\n   o  accept the specification as-is for processing\
    \ as an individual\n      standards-track submission.\n   Transfer encoding specifications\
    \ on the standards track follow normal\n   IETF rules for standards-track documents.\
    \  A transfer encoding is\n   considered to be defined and available for use once\
    \ it is on the\n   standards track.\n"
- title: 3.3.  IANA Procedures for Transfer Encoding Registration
  contents:
  - "3.3.  IANA Procedures for Transfer Encoding Registration\n   There is no need\
    \ for a special procedure for registering Transfer\n   Encodings with the IANA.\
    \  All legitimate transfer encoding\n   registrations MUST appear as a standards-track\
    \ RFC, so it is the\n   IESG's responsibility to notify the IANA when a new transfer\
    \ encoding\n   has been approved.\n"
