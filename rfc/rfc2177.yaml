- title: 1.   Abstract
  contents:
  - "1.   Abstract\n   The Internet Message Access Protocol [IMAP4] requires a client\
    \ to\n   poll the server for changes to the selected mailbox (new mail,\n   deletions).\
    \  It's often more desirable to have the server transmit\n   updates to the client\
    \ in real time.  This allows a user to see new\n   mail immediately.  It also\
    \ helps some real-time applications based on\n   IMAP, which might otherwise need\
    \ to poll extremely often (such as\n   every few seconds).  (While the spec actually\
    \ does allow a server to\n   push EXISTS responses aysynchronously, a client can't\
    \ expect this\n   behaviour and must poll.)\n   This document specifies the syntax\
    \ of an IDLE command, which will\n   allow a client to tell the server that it's\
    \ ready to accept such\n   real-time updates.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.   Conventions Used in this Document\n   In examples, \"C:\" and \"S:\" indicate\
    \ lines sent by the client and\n   server respectively.\n   The key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", and \"MAY\"\n   in this document are\
    \ to be interpreted as described in RFC 2060\n   [IMAP4].\n"
- title: 3.   Specification
  contents:
  - "3.   Specification\n   IDLE Command\n   Arguments:  none\n   Responses:  continuation\
    \ data will be requested; the client sends\n               the continuation data\
    \ \"DONE\" to end the command\n   Result:     OK - IDLE completed after client\
    \ sent \"DONE\"\n               NO - failure: the server will not allow the IDLE\n\
    \                    command at this time\n              BAD - command unknown\
    \ or arguments invalid\n   The IDLE command may be used with any IMAP4 server\
    \ implementation\n   that returns \"IDLE\" as one of the supported capabilities\
    \ to the\n   CAPABILITY command.  If the server does not advertise the IDLE\n\
    \   capability, the client MUST NOT use the IDLE command and must poll\n   for\
    \ mailbox updates.  In particular, the client MUST continue to be\n   able to\
    \ accept unsolicited untagged responses to ANY command, as\n   specified in the\
    \ base IMAP specification.\n   The IDLE command is sent from the client to the\
    \ server when the\n   client is ready to accept unsolicited mailbox update messages.\
    \  The\n   server requests a response to the IDLE command using the continuation\n\
    \   (\"+\") response.  The IDLE command remains active until the client\n   responds\
    \ to the continuation, and as long as an IDLE command is\n   active, the server\
    \ is now free to send untagged EXISTS, EXPUNGE, and\n   other messages at any\
    \ time.\n   The IDLE command is terminated by the receipt of a \"DONE\"\n   continuation\
    \ from the client; such response satisfies the server's\n   continuation request.\
    \  At that point, the server MAY send any\n   remaining queued untagged responses\
    \ and then MUST immediately send\n   the tagged response to the IDLE command and\
    \ prepare to process other\n   commands. As in the base specification, the processing\
    \ of any new\n   command may cause the sending of unsolicited untagged responses,\n\
    \   subject to the ambiguity limitations.  The client MUST NOT send a\n   command\
    \ while the server is waiting for the DONE, since the server\n   will not be able\
    \ to distinguish a command from a continuation.\n   The server MAY consider a\
    \ client inactive if it has an IDLE command\n   running, and if such a server\
    \ has an inactivity timeout it MAY log\n   the client off implicitly at the end\
    \ of its timeout period.  Because\n   of that, clients using IDLE are advised\
    \ to terminate the IDLE and\n   re-issue it at least every 29 minutes to avoid\
    \ being logged off.\n   This still allows a client to receive immediate mailbox\
    \ updates even\n   though it need only \"poll\" at half hour intervals.\n   Example:\
    \    C: A001 SELECT INBOX\n               S: * FLAGS (Deleted Seen)\n        \
    \       S: * 3 EXISTS\n               S: * 0 RECENT\n               S: * OK [UIDVALIDITY\
    \ 1]\n               S: A001 OK SELECT completed\n               C: A002 IDLE\n\
    \               S: + idling\n               ...time passes; new mail arrives...\n\
    \               S: * 4 EXISTS\n               C: DONE\n               S: A002\
    \ OK IDLE terminated\n               ...another client expunges message 2 now...\n\
    \               C: A003 FETCH 4 ALL\n               S: * 4 FETCH (...)\n     \
    \          S: A003 OK FETCH completed\n               C: A004 IDLE\n         \
    \      S: * 2 EXPUNGE\n               S: * 3 EXISTS\n               S: + idling\n\
    \               ...time passes; another client expunges message 3...\n       \
    \        S: * 3 EXPUNGE\n               S: * 2 EXISTS\n               ...time\
    \ passes; new mail arrives...\n               S: * 3 EXISTS\n               C:\
    \ DONE\n               S: A004 OK IDLE terminated\n               C: A005 FETCH\
    \ 3 ALL\n               S: * 3 FETCH (...)\n               S: A005 OK FETCH completed\n\
    \               C: A006 IDLE\n"
