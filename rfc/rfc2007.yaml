    \   As the range of information and services on the Internet expands, so\n   does\
    \ the potential user population.  Given the significant investment\n   in the\
    \ network and the various networked information and data\n   services, it is essential\
    \ that the broad spectrum of potential users\n   are made aware of these services.\
    \  In particular they require\n   training in using these facilities and in making\
    \ effective use of the\n   tools available for searching for and retrieving information\n\
    \   available on the global network.\n   The rapid expansion of the user base\
    \ has made it difficult for\n   network trainers to keep up with the demand for\
    \ training. Librarians,\n   Computing Service staff and subject-based Network\
    \ Support staff all\n   have a vital role to play in training users. Easy access\
    \ to quality\n   network training materials and the pooling of resources will\
    \ help\n   spread the load.\n   The purpose of this document is to provide a catalogue\
    \ of quality\n   Network Training Materials for use by Internet trainers.  By\n\
    \   providing such a collection of pointers to useful resources, it is\n   hoped\
    \ that trainers will be relieved of much of the load of producing\n   current\
    \ training materials.  The intention is to make this a \"living\n   document\"\
    .  It will be held on-line so that each section may be\n   updated separately\
    \ as appropriate.\n2. How the information was collected\n   The information contained\
    \ in this report was collected over the\n   network by volunteers from the Trainmat\
    \ Working Group from the\n   contacts for each network training resource using\
    \ the Trainmat\n   template (see Appendix A).  The contents of this template had\
    \ been\n   discussed by the Trainmat WG at its meetings and on the mailing list.\n\
    \   The decision on whether or not to include an item was made by the\n   members\
    \ of the working group.\n3. What is covered?\n   This catalogue covers network\
    \ training materials. These are\n   categorised as follows:\n   Presentation Material:\
    \  including OHP masters, speaker's\n                           hand-outs and\
    \ speaker's notes\n   Workshop Exercises:     including workshop hand-outs as\
    \ well\n                           as detailed instructions for\n            \
    \               undertaking hands-on exercises\n   Self-Paced Material:    including\
    \ online tutorials\n   Some material such as selected User Guides, Resource Guides\n\
    \   and Trainer Guides are of particular use to trainers and\n   have been included\
    \ as appropriate. The resource lists included\n   are those assembled for training\
    \ purposes and those frequently\n   used or referred to in training.\n   Special\
    \ Online Collections of training materials are now\n   available and a selection\
    \ of these is included.\n   The full list of Categories used is:\n           User\
    \ Guides\n           Resource Guides\n           Trainer Guides\n           Presentation\
    \ Material\n           Workshop Exercises\n           Self-Paced Material\n  \
    \         Online Collections\n4. Updating information\n   The catalogue is available\
    \ online. As this will be more up to date\n   than the RFC version, the online\
    \ version should be used as the basis\n   for any updates. The WWW version of\
    \ the document provides a\n   mechanism, through an HTML form, to send updates\
    \ (and new material)\n   to the maintainers of this catalogue.\n   To access the\
    \ document online you may use the World Wide Web using:\n     http://www.trainmat.ietf.org/catalogue.html\n\
    \     http://www.trainmat.ietf.org/template.html\n   Updates to the catalogue\
    \ are welcome and can be made by either\n   completing a template and sending\
    \ it to \"catalogue@connect.com.au\" or\n   (preferably) by using the HTML form\
    \ on the World Wide Web\n      http://www.trainmat.ietf.org/form.html\n   The\
    \ new and revised entries are reviewed by a small international\n   editorial\
    \ board made up of TRAINMAT volunteers. The updating of the\n   catalogue is done\
    \ on a best effort basis and is subject to review.\n5. Network Training Materials\n\
    \   This section contains the completed templates of network training\n   material,\
    \ as received by the publication date of this document.  The\n   online versions\
    \ of this document may have more up to date material.\n   The material falls into\
    \ the following broad categories (see also\n   section 3):\n       User Guides\n\
    \       Resource Guides\n       Trainer Guides\n       Presentation material\n\
    \       Workshop exercises\n       Self-paced material\n       On-Line Collections\n\

    \ B: Notes on completing the TrainMat template\n1.      Selecting a new resource\
    \ for inclusion\n   When considering a new resource for inclusion in the Trainmat\n\
    \   Catalogue, you will need to ask a few questions to decide whether or\n   not\
    \ it should be included.\n1.1     Does the item belong in a Training Materials\
    \ Catalogue?\n   This catalogue covers network training materials, including self\n\
    \   teaching materials, and other resources which facilitate and support\n   training.\n\
    \   A generous interpretation of what constitutes 'training materials' is\n  \
    \ appropriate. (See also the note 3.2 on 'Category'.) Training can be\n   thought\
    \ of as 'seeking to change behaviour', and if a document does\n   try to do that,\
    \ then it can be considered for inclusion in this\n   catalogue.  A document that\
    \ leads the reader through sample exercises\n   may come into this category, but\
    \ a reference card listing the\n   commands to use does not. Appropriate  resource\
    \ lists to include are\n   lists assembled for training purposes and lists frequently\
    \ used or\n   referred to in training.\n   As this is an international catalogue\
    \ it is generally not appropriate\n   to include material for specific services\
    \ or networks. That said,\n   some national or regional network training material\
    \ is of sufficient\n   generality to be considered for inclusion.\n1.2      Is\
    \ the content reasonably up-to-date and worth including?\n   It is intended that\
    \ the catalogue contains a selection of quality\n   training materials, not a\
    \ comprehensive list of everything available.\n   Some degree of 'quality control'\
    \ is needed on the entries. You will\n   need to decide whether the item is still\
    \ relevant and reasonably up-\n   to-date.  Anything which is two or more years\
    \ old requires careful\n   scrutiny.\n1.3     Is it easily available?\n   Is there\
    \ an established mechanism for obtaining it? This doesn't mean\n   it has to be\
    \ free.\n2.      Submitting a new or revised template\n   The template for inputting\
    \ new entries to the catalogue is given in\n   Appendix A. The prefered method\
    \ of inputting new or updated\n   information is via an HTML form accessible via\
    \ the following URL:\n           http://www.trainmat.ietf.org/form.html\n   You\
    \ will need to use a Web browser with forms capability. Input\n   should be quite\
    \ straightforward. There are drop-down menus to help\n   with input to some fields.\n\
    \   Alternatively, completed templates may be emailed to:\n           catalogue@connect.com.au\n\
    \   This mailing list is a small closed 'review' group for deciding\n   whether\
    \ or not an item should be included in the catalogue.\n   Please note that when\
    \ you enter a new template you will be listed as\n   the person responsible for\
    \ the entry.\n   The same procedures may be used by the person responsible for\
    \ an\n   entry, to update an existing entry.\n3.      Notes on completing the\
    \ various fields of the template\n   The intention is to keep each entry reasonably\
    \ short (and preferably\n   not more than one page in length). Descriptions and\
    \ other long fields\n   should therefore be kept to a reasonable length. Note\
    \ that fields\n   continued on the next line should be indented by at least one\
    \ white\n   space\n   Each completed template is auto-allocated a \"handle\" to\
    \ uniquely\n   identify it.\n3.1     Handle\n   A unique identifier for the material\
    \ at this source. This field is\n   usually automatically generated and need not\
    \ be entered when creating\n   a new entry from the template.\n3.2     Category\n\
    \   \"Category\"  should be selected from the following set:\n           User\
    \ Guides\n           Resource Guides\n           Trainer Guides\n           Presentation\
    \ material\n           Workshop Exercises\n           Self-Paced material\n  \
    \         On-Line Collections\n   Only user guides that are particularly useful\
    \ in training should be\n   included.\n   Appropriate resource lists to include\
    \ are lists assembled for\n   training purposes and lists frequently used or referred\
    \ to in\n   training.\n   Presentation material would include OHP masters, speaker's\
    \ hand-outs\n   and speaker's notes.\n   Workshop exercises would include workshop\
    \ hand-outs as well as\n   detailed instructions for undertaking hands-on exercises.\n\
    \   Self-Paced material would include online tutorials.\n   Online Collections\
    \ are useful lists of training materials.\n3.3     Country\n   The ISO two letter\
