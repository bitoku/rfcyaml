- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   There are a number of unpleasant edge conditions created\
    \ by the SIP\n   non-INVITE transaction (NIT) model's fixed duration.  The negative\n\
    \   aspects of some of these are exacerbated by the effect that\n   provisional\
    \ responses have on the non-INVITE transaction state\n   machines.  These problems\
    \ are documented in [3].  In summary:\n      A non-INVITE transaction must complete\
    \ immediately or risk losing\n      a race\n      Losing the race will cause the\
    \ requester to stop sending traffic\n      to the responder (the responder will\
    \ be temporarily blacklisted)\n      Provisional responses can delay recovery\
    \ from lost final responses\n      The 408 response is useless for the non-INVITE\
    \ transaction\n      As non-INVITE transactions through N proxies time-out, there\
    \ can\n      be an O(N^2) storm of the useless 408 responses\n   This document\
    \ specifies updates to RFC 3261 [1] to improve the\n   behavior of SIP elements\
    \ when these edge conditions arise.\n"
- title: 2.  Improving the Situation When Responses Are Only Delayed
  contents:
  - "2.  Improving the Situation When Responses Are Only Delayed\n   There are two\
    \ goals to achieve when we constrain the problem to those\n   cases where all\
    \ elements are ultimately responsive and networks\n   ultimately deliver messages:\n\
    \   o  Reduce the probability of losing the race, preferably to the point\n  \
    \    that it is negligible\n   o  Reduce or eliminate useless messaging\n"
- title: '2.1.  Action 1: Make the best use of provisional responses'
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Action 1: Make the best use of provisional responses\n   o  Disallow non-100\
    \ provisionals to non-INVITE requests\n   o  Disallow 100 Trying to non-INVITE\
    \ requests before Timer E reaches\n      T2 (for UDP hops)\n   o  Allow 100 Trying\
    \ after Timer E reaches T2 (for UDP hops)\n   o  Allow 100 Trying for hops over\
    \ reliable transports\n   Since non-INVITE transactions must complete rapidly\
    \ ([3]), any\n   information beyond \"I'm here\" (which can be provided by a 100\
    \ Trying)\n   can be just as usefully delayed to the final response.  Sending\
    \ non-\n   100 provisionals wastes bandwidth.\n   As shown in [3], sending any\
    \ provisional response inside a NIT before\n   Timer E reaches T2 damages recovery\
    \ from failure of an unreliable\n   transport.\n   Without a provisional, a late\
    \ final response is the same as no\n   response at all and will likely result\
    \ in blacklisting the late-\n   responding element ([3]).  If an element is delaying\
    \ its final\n   response at all, sending a 100 Trying after Timer E reaches T2\n\
    \   prevents this blacklisting without damaging recovery from unreliable\n   transport\
    \ failure.\n   Blacklisting on a late response occurs even over reliable transports.\n\
    \   Thus, if an element processing a request received over a reliable\n   transport\
    \ is delaying its final response at all, sending a 100 Trying\n   well in advance\
    \ of the timeout will prevent blacklisting.  Sending a\n   100 Trying immediately\
    \ will not harm the transaction as it would over\n   UDP, but a policy of always\
    \ sending such a message results in\n   unnecessary traffic.  A policy of sending\
    \ a 100 Trying after the\n   period of time in which Timer E reaches T2 had this\
    \ been a UDP hop is\n   one reasonable compromise.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.2.  Action 2: Remove the useless late-response storm\n   o  Disallow 408 to\
    \ non-INVITE requests\n   o  Absorb stray non-INVITE responses at proxies\n  \
    \ A 408 to non-INVITE will always arrive too late to be useful ([3]),\n   The\
    \ client already has full knowledge of the timeout.  The only\n   information\
    \ this message would convey is whether or not the server\n   believed the transaction\
    \ timed out.  However, with the current design\n   of the NIT, a client cannot\
    \ do anything with this knowledge.  Thus,\n   the 408 is simply wasting network\
    \ resources and contributes to the\n   response bombardment illustrated in [3].\n\
    \   Late non-INVITE responses by definition arrive after the client\n   transaction's\
    \ Timer F has fired and the client transaction has\n   entered the Terminated\
    \ state.  Thus, these responses cannot be\n   distinguished from strays.  Changing\
    \ the protocol behavior to\n   prohibit forwarding non-INVITE stray responses\
    \ stops the late-\n   response storm.  It also improves the proxy's defenses against\n\
    \   malicious users counting on the RFC 3261 requirement to forward such\n   strays.\n"
- title: 3.  Improving the Situation When an Element Is Not Going to Respond
  contents:
  - "3.  Improving the Situation When an Element Is Not Going to Respond\n   When\
    \ we expand the scope of the problem to also deal with element or\n   network\
    \ failure, we have more goals to achieve:\n   o  Identifying when an element is\
    \ non-responsive\n   o  Minimizing or eliminating falsely identifying responsive\
    \ elements\n      as non-responsive\n   o  Avoiding non-responsive elements with\
    \ future requests\n   Action 1 helps with the first two goals, dramatically improving\
    \ an\n   element's ability to distinguish between failure and delayed response\n\
    \   from the next downstream element.  Some response, either provisional\n   or\
    \ final, will almost certainly be received before the transaction\n   times out.\
    \  So, an element can more safely assume that no response at\n   all indicates\
    \ that the peer is not available and follow the existing\n   requirements in [1]\
    \ and [2] for that case.\n   Achieving the third goal requires more aggressive\
    \ changes to the\n   protocol.  As noted in [3], future non-INVITE transactions\
    \ are likely\n   to fail again unless the implementation takes steps beyond what\
    \ is\n   defined in [1] and [2] to remember non-responsive destinations\n   between\
    \ transactions.  Standardizing these extra steps is left to\n   future work.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Action 1\n   An SIP element MUST NOT send any provisional response with\
    \ a Status-\n   Code other than 100 to a non-INVITE request.\n   An SIP element\
    \ MUST NOT respond to a non-INVITE request with a\n   Status-Code of 100 over\
    \ any unreliable transport, such as UDP, before\n   the amount of time it takes\

  - "4.2.  Action 2\n   A transaction-stateful SIP element MUST NOT send a response\

    \   element that cannot respond before the transaction expires will not\n   send\

    \ any response to a\n   non-INVITE request unless it has a matching server transaction\
    \ that\n   is not in the Terminated state.  As a consequence, this proxy will\n\
    \   not forward any \"late\" non-INVITE responses.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document makes a number of small changes\
    \ to the core SIP\n   specification [1] to improve the robustness of SIP non-INVITE\n\
    \   transactions.  Many of these actions also prevent flooding and\n   denial-of-service\
    \ attacks.\n   One change prohibits proxies and user agents from sending 408\n\
    \   responses to non-INVITE transactions.  Without this change, proxies\n   automatically\
    \ generate a storm of useless responses as described in\n   [3].  An attacker\
    \ could capitalize on this by enticing user agents to\n   send non-INVITE requests\
    \ to a black hole (through social engineering\n   or DNS poisoning) or by selectively\
    \ dropping responses.\n   Another change prohibits proxies from forwarding late\
    \ responses.\n   Without this change, an attacker could easily forge messages\
    \ that\n   appear to be late responses.  All proxies compliant with RFC 3261 are\n\
    \   required to forward these responses, wasting bandwidth and CPU and\n   potentially\
    \ overwhelming target user agents (especially those with\n   low-speed connections).\n\
    \   The remainder of these changes do not affect the security of the SIP\n   protocol.\n"
