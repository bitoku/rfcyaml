  - "                     \"VERY DISTANT\" HOST INTERFACE\n     The normal method\
    \ of connecting a Host computer to the ARPA\nNetwork is, and will continue to\
    \ be, placing an IMP at the Host\nsite and making a short-distance hard-wire connection.\
    \  However,\nduring the past several months we have become increasingly aware\n\
    of the occasional desire to interface a Host to some IMP via a\nlong-distance\
    \ connection (where long-distance, in this context,\nis any cable run longer than\
    \ 2000 feet but may typically be tens\nof miles) via either a hard-wire or telephone\
    \ circuit.  We believe\nthat any good solution to the general problem of interfacing\
    \ Hosts\nto IMPs must satisfy at least the following criteria:\n     1)  The characteristics\
    \ of the connection should be such\n         that the undetected error rate can\
    \ be expected to be\n         extremely low.\n     2)  The bandwidth of the connection\
    \ should not be\n         intrinsically limited to a low value.\n     3)  The\
    \ nature of the connection should be such that the\n         Host may establish\
    \ multiple network \"conversations\",\n         i.e., it should have all the power\
    \ of a normal Host\n         connection.\nThese criteria were briefly discussed\
    \ in our earlier RFC #241\n(NIC #7671), \"Connecting Computers to MLC Ports.\"\
    \n     After a careful review of the various possibilities for \"very\ndistant\"\
    \ Host connection, we have arrived at a preliminary design\nfor this type of interface\
    \ which we believe should prove\nsatisfactory with regard to the criteria above.\
    \  Although\ndetailed specifications will not be available for some time, the\n\
    basic elements of the design are as follows:\ncommunication.  At the IMP end,\
    \ a hardware interface identical\nin type, but not necessarily in speed, to the\
    \ usual IMP 50 kilobit\nmodem interface will be used.  This interface frames blocks\
    \ of\noutgoing data with special characters and appends a 24 bit cyclic\nredundancy\
    \ check (CRC).  It de-frames and checks incoming blocks\nwhich must be of similar\
    \ format.  The Host must provide mating\nformatting, de-formatting and checking\
    \ facilities at its end.\n     In conjunction with the CRC creation and checking,\
    \ the IMP\nwill be provided with a small amount of \"retransmission\" software\n\
    as a front (i.e., Host side) end for the usual Host/IMP interface\nsoftware. The\
    \ retransmission scheme, although not presently\ncompletely defined, will be based\
    \ on positive acknowledgment/\ntimeout techniques.\n     The Host will be required\
    \ to provide a front (i.e. IMP side)\nend to its NCP which can generate CRCs and\
    \ test for CRC errors,\nprovide simple retransmission logic, etc.  This front\
    \ end may be\nimplemented in Host software, by means of special purpose hardware,\n\
    in a minicomputer, or in any other way which the Host organization\nfinds reasonable.\n\
    \     This new type of interface will be completely documented,\nfrom both a hardware\
    \ and software point of view, as soon as the\ndetailed design is completed.  This\
    \ documentation will probably\ntake the form of an update to BBN report No. 1822.\n\
    \     We will be happy to discuss this type of interface with any\ninterested\
    \ organization, although it should be remembered that\ndetailed design is not\
    \ yet completed.\nAMcK:jm\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form\
