Traditionally, TCP and UDP runs over IP.
STD 17, RFC 1213 defines TCP connection
MIB object and UDP listener object assuming just that.
For TCP and UDP running over IPX, tcpConnTable and udpTable objects from RFC 1213 cannot be used since they define the address to be of type IpAddress.
As such, we need to define new objects that can properly describe TCP and UDP connections over IPX.
New MIB objects, tcpIpxConnTable, udpIpxTable, tcpUnspecConnTable and udpUnspecTable are presented in this paper, to be used in place of tcpConnTable
and udpListenerTable when TCP and UDP are running over IPX.

the connection makes the transition to the CLOSED state.

"The state of this TCP connection.
The only value which may be set by a management station is deleteTCB(12).
Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to set this object to any other value.
If a management station sets this object to the value deleteTCB(12), then this has the effect of deleting the TCB (as defined in RFC 793) of the corresponding connection on the managed node, resulting in immediate termination of the connection.
As an implementation specific option, a RST segment may be sent from the managed node to the other TCP endpoint (note however that RST segments are not sent reliably)."

"The local IPX address for this TCP connection.
In the case of a connection in the listen state which is willing to accept connections for any interface, the value 00000000:000000000000 is used.
See tcpUnspecConnTable for connections in the listen  state which is willing to accept connects for any IP interface associated with the node."
NetworkAddress defined in SMI only include IP currently,
so we can't use it to represent both IP and IPX address.
