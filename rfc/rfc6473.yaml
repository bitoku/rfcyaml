  - "1.  Introduction\n   Version 4 of the vCard specification [RFC6350] defines a\
    \ new KIND\n   property to specify the type of entity that a vCard represents.\n\
    \   During its work on the base vCard4 specification, the VCARDDAV\n   Working\
    \ Group defined values of \"individual\", \"organization\",\n   \"group\", and\
    \ \"location\" for the KIND property.  The working group\n   considered but then\
    \ removed a value of \"thing\" to represent any type\n   of physical entity, machine,\
    \ software application, etc., with the\n   expectation that such a value might\
    \ be defined in a vCard extension.\n   This document does not define a generic\
    \ \"thing\" value but instead\n   defines a more narrow \"application\" value\
    \ so that vCards can be used\n   to represent software applications.\n"
- title: 2.  Meaning
  contents:
  - "2.  Meaning\n   When the KIND property has a value of \"application\", the vCard\n\
    \   represents a software application such as a server, an online service\n  \
    \ (e.g., a chat room), or an automated software bot.  More formally, an\n   \"\
    application\" is functionally equivalent to the 'applicationProcess'\n   object\
    \ class used in the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n   [RFC4519] as derived\
    \ from the Open Systems Interconnection model\n   [X.521] [X.200].  As one example\
    \ of the \"application\" KIND, vCards\n   are currently used in the Extensible\
    \ Messaging and Presence Protocol\n   [RFC6120] to represent instant messaging\
    \ servers that are deployed on\n   the network.\n   The properties included in\
    \ an application's vCard apply to one of the\n   following:\n   o  The application\
    \ itself (e.g., the FN property might represent the\n      friendly name of an\
    \ application service, the URL property might\n      represent a website that\
    \ contains further information about the\n      service, and the ADR, GEO, and\
    \ TZ properties might represent the\n      physical address, geographical location,\
    \ and time zone of the\n      machine where the service is hosted).\n   o  An\
    \ organization or person that makes the application available on\n      the network\
    \ (e.g., the LOGO property might represent the corporate\n      logo of a service\
    \ provider).\n   o  A person or role that maintains the application (e.g., the\
    \ TEL,\n      EMAIL, and IMPP properties might represent ways to contact a\n \
    \     server administrator).\n   When a property represents some aspect of the\
    \ application itself, it\n   makes no sense to include the \"work\" and \"home\"\
    \ values of the TYPE\n   parameter since software applications do not have work\
    \ places and\n   personal lives (see the definition of the TYPE parameter in Section\n\
    \   5.6 of [RFC6350]).  When a property represents information about an\n   individual\
    \ associated with the application (e.g., an individual\n   service administrator\
    \ as opposed to a generic service administrator\n   role or an associated organization),\
    \ inclusion of the \"work\" and\n   \"home\" values can be appropriate.\n   The\
    \ following base properties make sense for vCards that represent\n   software\
    \ applications (this list is not exhaustive, and other\n   properties might be\
    \ applicable as well):\n   o  ADR\n   o  EMAIL\n   o  FN\n   o  GEO\n   o  IMPP\n\
    \   o  KEY\n   o  KIND\n   o  LANG\n   o  LOGO\n   o  NOTE\n   o  ORG\n   o  PHOTO\n\
    \   o  REV\n   o  SOURCE\n   o  TEL\n   o  TZ\n   o  URL\n   Although it might\
    \ be desirable to define a more fine-grained taxonomy\n   of applications (e.g.,\
    \ a KIND of \"application\" with a subtype of\n   \"server\" or \"IM server\"\
    ), such a taxonomy is out of the scope of this\n   document.\n"

- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has added \"application\" to the registry of\
    \ property values for\n   vCard4.  In conformance with Section 10.2.6 of [RFC6350],\
    \ the\n   registration is as follows, where the reference is to RFC 6473.\n  \
    \ Value:  application\n   Purpose:  The entity represented by the vCard is a software\n\
    \      application (e.g., a server, an online service such as a chat\n      room,\
    \ or an automated software bot).\n   Conformance:  This value can be used with\
    \ the KIND property.\n   Example:  See Section 3 of RFC 6473.\n"
