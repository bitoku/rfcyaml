  - "1 Introduction\n   The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is an application level\
    \ protocol\n   that can be used for distributed printing using Internet tools\
    \ and\n   technologies.  IPP version 1.1 ([RFC2911, RFC2910]) focuses on end\n\
    \   user functionality with a few administrative operations included (for\n  \
    \ a description of the base IPP documents, see Appendix A).  This\n   document\
    \ defines the requirements and use cases for additional\n   optional end user,\
    \ operator, and administrator operations used to\n   control Job objects, Printer\
    \ objects (see [RFC2911]) and a new Device\n   object.  The new Device object\
    \ more closely models a single output\n   device and has no notion of a job, while\
    \ the Printer object models a\n   print service which understands jobs and may\
    \ represent one or more\n   output devices.\n   The scope of IPP is characterized\
    \ in RFC 2567 [RFC2567] \"Design Goals\n   for an Internet Printing Protocol\"\
    .  It is not the intent of this\n   document to revise or clarify this scope or\
    \ conjecture as to the\n   degree of industry adoption or trends related to IPP\
    \ within printing\n   systems.  It is the intent of this document to extend the\
    \ original\n   set of operations - in a similar fashion to the Set1 extensions\
    \ which\n   referred to IPP/1.0 and were later incorporated into IPP/1.1.\n"
- title: 2 Terminology
  contents:
  - "2 Terminology\n   This section defines terminology used throughout this document\
    \ and\n   the corresponding documents that define the Administrative operations\n\
    \   on Job, Printer, and Device objects.\n   This document uses terms such as\
    \ \"client\", \"Printer\", \"Job\",\n   \"attributes\", \"keywords\", and \"support\"\
    .  These terms have special\n   meaning and are defined in the model terminology\
    \ [RFC2911] section\n   12.2.\n   In addition, the following capitalized terms\
    \ are defined:\n      IPP Printer object (or Printer for short) - a software abstraction\n\
    \         defined by [RFC2911].\n      Printer Operation - an operation whose\
    \ target is an IPP Printer\n         object and whose effect is on the Printer\
    \ object.\n      Output Device - the physical imaging mechanism that an IPP Printer\n\
    \         controls.  Note: while this term is capitalized in this\n         specification\
    \ (but not in [RFC2911]), there is no formal object\n         called an Output\
    \ Device.\n      Device Operation - an operation whose target is an IPP Printer\n\
    \         object and whose defined effect is on an Output Device.\n      Output\
    \ Device Fan-Out - a configuration in which an IPP Printer\n         controls\
    \ more that one output-device.\n      Printer fan-out - a configuration in which\
    \ an IPP Printer object\n         controls more than one Subordinate IPP Printer\
    \ object.\n      Printer fan-in - a configuration in which an IPP Printer object\
    \ is\n         controlled by more than one IPP Printer object.\n      Subordinate\
    \ Printer - an IPP Printer object that is controlled by\n         another IPP\
    \ Printer object.  Such a Subordinate Printer may\n         have one or more Subordinate\
    \ Printers.\n      Leaf Printer - a Subordinate Printer that has no Subordinate\n\
    \         Printers.\n      Non-Leaf Printer - an IPP Printer object that has one\
    \ or more\n         Subordinate Printers.\n      Chained Printer - a Non-Leaf\
    \ Printer that has exactly one\n         Subordinate Printer.\n      Job Creation\
    \ operations - IPP operations that create a Job object:\n         Print-Job, Print-URI,\
    \ and Create-Job.\n"

  contents:
  - "3 Requirements and Use Cases\n   The Administrative operations for Job and Printer\
    \ objects will be\n   defined in one document [ipp-ops-set2].  The Administrative\n\
    \   operations for Device objects will be defined in a separate document.\n  \
    \ The requirements are presented here together to show the parallelism.\n    \
    \  1.    Have separate operations for affecting the IPP Printer\n            versus\
    \ affecting the Output Device, so its clear what the\n            intent of each\
    \ is, and implementers can implement one or the\n            other or both.\n\
    \      2.    Support fan-out of Printer objects.\n      3.    Support fan-out\
    \ of Output Devices.\n      4.    Support fan-in of Printer objects, as long as\
    \ it doesn't\n            make the semantics more complicated when not supporting\n\
    \            fan-in.\n      5.    Support fan-in of output objects, as long as\
    \ it doesn't make\n            the semantics more complicated when not supporting\
    \ fan-in.\n      6.    Instead of having operation attributes that alter the\n\
    \            behavior of the operation significantly, have separate\n        \
    \    operations, so that it is simple and clear to a client which\n          \
    \  semantics the Printer is supporting (by querying the\n            \"operations-supported\"\
    \ attribute) and it is simple to\n            describe the capabilities of a Printer\
    \ implementation in\n            written documentation (just list the optional\
    \ operations\n            supported).\n      7.    Need a Printer Operation to\
    \ prevent a Printer object from\n            accepting new IPP jobs, but currently\
    \ accepted jobs continue\n            unaffected to be scheduled and processed.\
    \  Need a companion\n            one to restore the Printer object to accept new\
    \ IPP jobs.\n            Usage:  Operator is preparing to take the IPP Printer\
    \ out of\n            service or to change the configuration of the IPP Printer.\n\
    \            Suggested name and operations:  Disable-Printer and Enable-\n   \
    \         Printer\n      8.    Need a Device Operation to prevent an Output Device\
    \ from\n            accepting any new jobs from any job submission protocol and\n\
    \            a companion one to restore the Output Device to accepting\n     \
    \       any jobs.\n            Usage:  Operator is preparing to take the Output\
    \ Device out\n            of service.\n            Suggested name and operations:\
    \  Disable-Device and Enable\n            Device\n      9.    Need a Printer Operation\
    \ to stop the processing after the\n            current IPP job completes and\
    \ not start processing any\n            additional IPP jobs (either by scheduling\
    \ the jobs or\n            sending them to the Output Device), but continue to\
    \ accept\n            new IPP jobs.  Need a companion operation to start\n   \
    \         processing/sending IPP jobs again.\n            Usage:  Operator wants\
    \ to gracefully stop the IPP Printer at\n            the next job boundary.  The\
    \ Pause-Printer-After-Current-Job\n            operation is also invoked implicitly\
    \ by the Deactivate-\n            Printer and the Shutdown-Printer Operations.\n\
    \            Suggested name and operations:  Pause-Printer-After-\n          \
    \  Current-Job, (IPP/1.1) Resume-Printer\n      10.   Need a Device Operation\
    \ to stop the processing the current\n            job \"immediately\", no matter\
    \ what protocol.  Its like the\n            Pause button on the Output Device.\
    \  This operation is for\n            emergencies.  The stop point depends on\
    \ implementation, but\n            can be mid page, end of page, end of sheet,\
    \ or after a few\n            sheets for Output Devices that can't stop that quickly.\
    \  The\n            paper path isn't run out.  Need a companion operation to\n\
    \            start processing the current any-protocol job without losing\n  \
    \          any thing.\n            Usage:  Operator sees something bad about to\
    \ happen, such as\n            the paper is about to jam, or the toner is running\
    \ out, or\n            the device is overheating or wants to add more paper.\n\
    \            Suggested name and operations:  Pause-Device-Now, Resume-\n     \
    \       Device\n      11.   Need a Printer Operation to stop the processing of\
    \ IPP jobs\n            after all of the currently accepted jobs have been\n \
    \           processed, but any newly accepted jobs go into the\n            'processing-held'\
    \ state.\n            Usage:  This allows an operator to reconfigure the Output\n\
    \            Device in order to let jobs that are held waiting for\n         \
    \   resources, such as special media, get a chance.  Then the\n            operator\
    \ uses another operation after reconfiguring.  He\n            repeats the two\
    \ operations to restore the Output Device to\n            its normal media.\n\
    \            Suggested name and operations:  Hold-New-Jobs, Release-\n       \
    \     Held-New-Jobs\n      12.   Need a Device Operation to stop processing the\
    \ current any-\n            protocol job at a convenient point, such as after\
    \ the\n            current copy (or end of job if last or only copy).  Need a\n\
    \            companion operation to start processing the current any-\n      \
    \      protocol job or next job without losing any thing.\n            Usage:\
    \  The operator wants to empty the output bin that is\n            near full.\
    \  The paper path is run out.\n            Suggested name and operations:  Pause-Device-After-Current-\n\
    \            Copy, Resume-Device\n      13.   Need a Device Operation that always\
    \ pauses on a device-\n            defined boundary, no matter how many copies,\
    \ in order to not\n            break up a job.  Need a companion operation to\
    \ start\n            processing the current any-protocol job or next job without\n\
    \            losing any thing.\n            Usage:  The operator wants to empty\
    \ the output bin that is\n            near full, but he doesn't want to break\
    \ up a job in case it\n            has multiple copies.  The paper path is run\
    \ out.\n            Suggested name and operations:  Pause-Device-After-Current-\n\
    \            Job, Resume-Device\n      14.   Need a Printer Operation that combines\
    \ Disable-Printer,\n            Pause-Printer-After-Current-Job, and rejects all\
    \ other Job,\n            Printer, and Device Operations, except Job and Printer\n\
    \            queries, System Administrator Set-Printer-Attributes, and\n     \
    \       the companion operation to resume activity.  In other words,\n       \
    \     this operation makes the Printer a read-only object in a\n            graceful\
    \ manner for end-users and the operator.\n            Usage:  The administrator\
    \ wants to reconfigure the Printer\n            object using the Set-Printer-Attributes\
    \ operation without\n            disturbing the current in process work, but wants\
    \ to make\n            sure that the operator isn't also trying to change the\n\
    \            Printer object as part of running the Printer.\n            Suggested\
    \ name and operation:  Deactivate-Printer,\n            Activate-Printer\n   \
    \   15.   Need a Device Operation that combines Disable-Device,\n            Pause-Device-After-Current-Job,\
    \ and rejects all other Device\n            Operations, except Job and Printer\
    \ queries and the companion\n            operation to resume activity.  In other\
    \ words, this\n            operation makes the Output Device a read-only object\
    \ in a\n            graceful manner.\n            Usage:  The field service person\
    \ wants to open up the device\n            without disturbing the current in process\
    \ work, perhaps to\n            replace staples, or replace the toner cartridge.\n\
    \            Suggested name and operation:  Deactivate-Device, Activate-\n   \
    \         Device\n      16.   Need a Printer Operation to recover from the IPP\
    \ Printer\n            software that has gotten confused (run out of heap memory\
    \ or\n            gotten into a state that it doesn't seem to be able to get\n\
    \            out of).  This is a condition that shouldn't happen, but\n      \
    \      does in real life.  Any volatile information is saved if\n            possible\
    \ before the software is re-initialized.  No\n            companion operation\
    \ is needed to undo this.  We don't want\n            to go back to the \"confused\"\
    \ state :-).\n            Usage:  The IPP Printer software has gotten confused\
    \ or\n            isn't responding properly.\n            Suggested name and operation:\
    \  Restart-Printer\n      17.   Need a Device Operation to recover from the Output\
    \ Device\n            hardware and software that has gotten confused (gotten into\n\
    \            a state that it doesn't seem to be able to get out of, run\n    \
    \        out of heap memory, etc.).  This is a condition that\n            shouldn't\
    \ happen, but does in real life.  This is the same\n            and has the same\
    \ options as the Printer MIB reset.  No\n            companion operation is needed\
    \ to undo this.  We don't want\n            to go back to the \"confused\" state\
    \ :-).\n            Usage:  The Output Device has gotten confused or need\n  \
    \          resetting to some initial conditions.\n            Suggested name and\
    \ operation:  Reset-Device\n      18.   Need a Printer Operation to put the IPP\
    \ Printer object out\n            of business with no way in the protocol to bring\
    \ that\n            instantiation back to life (but see Startup-Printer which\n\
    \            brings up exactly one new instantiation to life with the\n      \
    \      same URL).  Any volatile information is saved if possible.\n          \
    \  Usage:  The Printer is being moved or the building's power\n            is\
    \ being shut off.\n            Suggested name and operation:  Shutdown-Printer\n\
    \      19.   Need a Printer Operation to bring an IPP Printer to life\n      \
    \      when there is an already running host.\n            Usage:  After the host\
    \ is started (by means outside the IPP\n            protocol), the operator is\
    \ able to ask the host to bring up\n            any number of Printer objects\
    \ (that the host has been\n            configured in some way) each with distinct\
    \ URLs.\n            Suggested name and operation:  Startup-Printer\n      20.\
    \   Need a Device Operation to power off the Output Device after\n           \
    \ writing out any software state.  It is assumed that other\n            operations\
    \ have more gracefully prepared the Output Device\n            for this drastic\
    \ and immediate.  There is no companion\n            Device Operation to bring\
    \ the power back on.\n            Usage:  The Output Device is going to be moved,\
    \ the power in\n            the building is going to be shutoff, the repair man\
    \ has\n            arrived and needs to take the Output Device apart.\n      \
    \      Suggested name and operation:  Power-Off-Device\n      21.   Need a Device\
    \ Operation to startup a powered-off device.\n            Usage:  After a Power-Off-Device,\
    \ if the device can be\n            powered back up (possibly by an intervening\
    \ host that\n            supports the Device Operation).\n            Suggest\

    \ includes:\n      Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol [RFC2567]\n\
    \      Rationale for the Structure and Model and Protocol for the\n      Internet\

    \      Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols [RFC2569]\n      Internet Printing\
    \ Protocol (IPP): IPP Event Notifications and\n      Subscriptions [ipp-ntfy]\n\
    \   The \"Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol\" document takes a\n\
    \   broad look at distributed printing functionality, and it enumerates\n   real-life\
    \ scenarios that help to clarify the features that need to be\n   included in\
    \ a printing protocol for the Internet.  It identifies\n   requirements for three\
    \ types of users: end users, operators, and\n   administrators.  It calls out\
    \ a subset of end user requirements that\n   are satisfied in IPP/1.0.  A few\
    \ optional operator operations have\n   been added to IPP/1.1.\n   The \"Rationale\
    \ for the Structure and Model and Protocol for the\n   Internet Printing Protocol\"\
    \ document describes IPP from a high level\n   view, defines a roadmap for the\
    \ various documents that form the suite\n   of IPP specification documents, and\
    \ gives background and rationale\n   for the IETF working group's major decisions.\n\
    \   The \"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics\" document\n   describes\
    \ a simplified model with abstract objects, their attributes,\n   and their operations\
    \ that are independent of encoding and transport.\n   It introduces a Printer\
    \ and a Job object.  The Job object optionally\n   supports multiple documents\
    \ per Job.  It also addresses security,\n   internationalization, and directory\
    \ issues.\n   The \"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport\" document\n\
    \   is a formal mapping of the abstract operations and attributes defined\n  \
    \ in the model document onto HTTP/1.1 [RFC2616].  It defines the\n   encoding\
    \ rules for a new Internet MIME media type called\n   \"application/ipp\".  This\
    \ document also defines the rules for\n   transporting over HTTP a message body\
    \ whose Content-Type is\n   \"application/ipp\".  This document defines the 'ippget'\
    \ scheme for\n   identifying IPP printers and jobs.\n   The \"Internet Printing\
    \ Protocol/1.1: Implementer's Guide\" document\n   gives insight and advice to\
    \ implementers of IPP clients and IPP\n   objects.  It is intended to help them\
    \ understand IPP/1.1 and some of\n   the considerations that may assist them in\
    \ the design of their client\n   and/or IPP object implementations.  For example,\
    \ a typical order of\n   processing requests is given, including error checking.\
    \  Motivation\n   for some of the specification decisions is also included.\n\
    \   The \"Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols\" document gives some\n   advice\
    \ to implementers of gateways between IPP and LPD (Line Printer\n   Daemon) implementations.\n\
    \   The \"IPP Event Notifications and Subscriptions\" document defines an\n  \
    \ extension to IPP/1.0 [RFC2566, RFC2565] and IPP/1.1 [RFC2911,\n   RFC2910].\
    \  This extension allows a client to subscribe to printing\n   related Events\
    \ and defines the semantics for delivering asynchronous\n   Event Notifications\
    \ to the specified Notification Recipient via a\n   specified Delivery Method\
    \ (i.e., protocols) defined in (separate)\n   Delivery Method documents.\n"
