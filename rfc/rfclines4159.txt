Abstract This document advises of the deprecation of the use of "ip6.int" for Standards Conformant IPv6 implementations.
In August 2001 the IETF published [RFC3152], which advised that the use of "ip6.int" as the domain for reverse mapping of IPv6 addresses to DNS names was deprecated.
The document noted that the use of "ip6.int" would be phased out in an orderly fashion.
As of 1 September 2005, the IETF advises the community that the DNS domain "ip6.int" should no longer be used to perform reverse mapping of IPv6 addresses to domain names, and that the domain "ip6.arpa" should be used henceforth, in accordance with the IANA Considerations described in [RFC3596].
The domain "ip6.int" is deprecated, and its use in IPv6 implementations that conform to the IPv6 Internet Standards is discontinued.
The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) are advised that maintenance of delegation of entries in "ip6.int" is no longer required as part of infrastructure services in support of Internet Standards Conformant IPv6 implementations as of 1 September 2005.
The RIRs are requested to work with their communities to adopt a schedule regarding the cessation of support of registration services for the "ip6.int" domain.
IANA Considerations IANA is advised that the "ip6.int" domain for reverse mapping of IPv6 addresses to domain names is no longer part of Internet Standards Conformant support of IPv6 as of 1 September 2005.
Security Considerations While DNS spoofing of address to name mapping has been exploited in IPv4, removal of the "ip6.int" zone from the standard IPv6 specification creates no new threats to the security of the internet.
