Abstract This document specifies the IANA guidelines for allocating new values for the Routing Type field in the IPv6 Routing Header.
This document specifies the IANA guidelines [RFC5226] for allocating new values for the Routing Type field in the IPv6 Routing Header [RFC2460].
Previously, no IANA guidance existed for such allocations.
IANA Considerations New Routing Type values are allocated through IETF Review or IESG Approval [RFC5226].
Note that two experimental values (253 and 254) are already available for use [RFC4727].
This specification does not change the security properties of the Routing Header.
However, past experience shows that it is easy to design routing headers that have significant problems [RFC5095].
Appendix A.  Changes from RFC 2460
This document specifies only the IANA rules associated with the Routing Type field.
