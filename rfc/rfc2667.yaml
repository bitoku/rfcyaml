    \ with\n   network management protocols in the Internet community.  In\n   particular,\
    \ it describes managed objects used for managing tunnels of\n   any type over\
    \ IPv4 networks.  Extension MIBs may be designed for\n   managing protocol-specific\
    \ objects. Likewise, extension MIBs may be\n   designed for managing security-specific\
    \ objects.  This MIB does not\n   support tunnels over non-IPv4 networks (including\
    \ IPv6 networks).\n   Management of such tunnels may be supported by other MIBs.\n"

  - "2.  Introduction\n   Over the past several years, there have been a number of\
    \ \"tunneling\"\n   protocols specified by the IETF (see [28] for an early discussion\
    \ of\n   the model and examples).  This document describes a Management\n   Information\
    \ Base (MIB) used for managing tunnels of any type over\n   IPv4 networks, including\
    \ GRE [16,17], IP-in-IP [18], Minimal\n   Encapsulation [19], L2TP [20], PPTP\
    \ [21], L2F [25], UDP (e.g., [26]),\n   ATMP [22], and IPv6-in-IPv4 [27] tunnels.\n\
    \   Extension MIBs may be designed for managing protocol-specific\n   objects.\
    \  Likewise, extension MIBs may be designed for managing\n   security-specific\
    \ objects (e.g., IPSEC [24]), and traffic conditioner\n   [29] objects.  Finally,\
    \ this MIB does not support tunnels over non-\n   IPv4 networks (including IPv6\
    \ networks).  Management of such tunnels\n   may be supported by other MIBs.\n"
- title: 3.  The SNMP Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "3.  The SNMP Network Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently\
    \ consists of five major\n   components:\n   o    An overall architecture, described\
    \ in RFC 2571 [1].\n   o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events\
    \ for the\n        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure\
    \ of\n        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in\n\
    \        STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The\n  \
    \      second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578\n      \
    \  [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].\n   o    Message protocols\
    \ for transferring management information. The\n        first version of the SNMP\
    \ message protocol is called SNMPv1 and\n        described in STD 15, RFC 1157\
    \ [8]. A second version of the SNMP\n        message protocol, which is not an\
    \ Internet standards track\n        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described\
    \ in RFC 1901 [9] and\n        RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the message\
    \ protocol is\n        called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572\
    \ [11] and\n        RFC 2574 [12].\n   o    Protocol operations for accessing\
    \ management information. The\n        first set of protocol operations and associated\
    \ PDU formats is\n        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol\n\
    \        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905\n    \
    \    [13].\n   o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14]\
    \ and\n        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575\n\
    \        [15].\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,\
    \ termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n\
    \   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.\n   This memo specifies a\
    \ MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1\
    \ can be produced through the appropriate\n   translations. The resulting translated\
    \ MIB must be semantically\n   equivalent, except where objects or events are\
    \ omitted because no\n   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine\
    \ readable\n   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions\
    \ in\n   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine\n\
    \   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the\n  \
    \ MIB.\n"
- title: 4.  Overview
  contents:
  - "4.  Overview\n   This MIB module contains two tables:\n   o    the Tunnel Interface\
    \ Table, containing information on the\n        tunnels known to a router; and\n\
    \   o    the Tunnel Config Table, which can be used for dynamic creation\n   \
    \     of tunnels, and also provides a mapping from endpoint addresses\n      \
    \  to the current interface index value.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Relationship to the Interfaces MIB
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Relationship to the Interfaces MIB\n   This section clarifies the relationship\
    \ of this MIB to the Interfaces\n   MIB [23].  Several areas of correlation are\
    \ addressed in the\n   following subsections.  The implementor is referred to\
    \ the Interfaces\n   MIB document in order to understand the general intent of\
    \ these\n   areas.\n"
- title: 4.1.1.  Layering Model
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  Layering Model\n   Each logical interface (physical or virtual) has an\
    \ ifEntry in the\n   Interfaces MIB [23].  Tunnels are handled by creating a logical\n\
    \   interface (ifEntry) for each tunnel. These are then correlated, using\n  \
    \ the ifStack table of the Interfaces MIB, to those interfaces on which\n   the\
    \ local IPv4 addresses of the tunnels are configured.  The basic\n   model, therefore,\
    \ looks something like this (for example):\n         | |         | |         \
    \ | |\n      +--+ +---+  +--+ +---+      | |\n      |IP-in-IP|  |  GRE   |   \
    \   | |\n      | tunnel |  | tunnel |      | |\n      +--+ +---+  +--+ +---+ \
    \     | |\n         | |         | |          | |    <== attachment to underlying\n\
    \      +--+ +---------+ +----------+ +--+     interfaces, to be provided\n   \
    \   |       Physical interface       |     by ifStack table\n      +--------------------------------+\n"
- title: 4.1.2.  ifRcvAddressTable
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  ifRcvAddressTable\n   The ifRcvAddressTable usage is defined in the MIBs\
    \ defining the\n   encapsulation below the network layer.  For example, if IP-in-IP\n\
    \   encapsulation is being used, the ifRcvAddressTable is defined by IP-\n   in-IP.\n"
- title: 4.1.3.  ifEntry
  contents:
  - "4.1.3.  ifEntry\n   IfEntries are defined in the MIBs defining the encapsulation\
    \ below\n   the network layer.  For example, if IP-in-IP encapsulation [20] is\n\
    \   being used, the ifEntry is defined by IP-in-IP.\n   The ifType of a tunnel\
    \ should be set to \"tunnel\" (131).  An entry in\n   the IP Tunnel MIB will exist\
    \ for every ifEntry with this ifType.  An\n   implementation of the IP Tunnel\
    \ MIB may allow ifEntries to be created\n   via the tunnelConfigTable.  Creating\
    \ a tunnel will also add an entry\n   in the ifTable and in the tunnelIfTable,\
    \ and deleting a tunnel will\n   likewise delete the entry in the ifTable and\
    \ the tunnelIfTable.\n   The use of two different tables in this MIB was an important\
    \ design\n   decision.  Traditionally, ifIndex values are chosen by agents, and\n\
    \   are permitted to change across restarts.  Allowing row creation\n   directly\
    \ in the Tunnel Interface Table, indexed by ifIndex, would\n   complicate row\
    \ creation and/or cause interoperability problems (if\n   each agent had special\
    \ restrictions on ifIndex). Instead, a separate\n   table is used which is indexed\
    \ only by objects over which the manager\n   has control.  Namely, these are the\
    \ addresses of the tunnel endpoints\n   and the encapsulation protocol.  Finally,\
    \ an additional manager-\n   chosen ID is used in the index to support protocols\
    \ such as L2F which\n   allow multiple tunnels between the same endpoints.\n"

    \ this table. The agent\n            need not support setting this object to createAndWait\
    \ or\n            notInService since there are no other writable objects in\n\
    \            this table, and writable objects in rows of corresponding\n     \
    \       tables such as the tunnelIfTable may be modified while this\n        \
    \    row is active.\n            To create a row in this table for an encapsulation\
    \ method\n            which does not support multiple parallel tunnels with the\n\
    \            same endpoints, the management station should simply use a\n    \
    \        tunnelConfigID of 1, and set tunnelConfigStatus to\n            createAndGo.\
    \  For encapsulation methods such as L2F which\n            allow multiple parallel\
    \ tunnels, the management station may\n            select a pseudo-random number\
    \ to use as the tunnelConfigID\n            and set tunnelConfigStatus to createAndGo.\
    \  In the event\n            that this ID is already in use and an inconsistentValue\
    \ is\n            returned in response to the set operation, the management\n\
    \            station should simply select a new pseudo-random number and\n   \
    \         retry the operation.\n            Creating a row in this table will\
    \ cause an interface index\n            to be assigned by the agent in an implementation-dependent\n\
    \            manner, and corresponding rows will be instantiated in the\n    \
    \        ifTable and the tunnelIfTable.  The status of this row will\n       \
    \     become active as soon as the agent assigns the interface\n            index,\
    \ regardless of whether the interface is operationally\n            up.\n    \
    \        Deleting a row in this table will likewise delete the\n            corresponding\

  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This MIB contains readable objects whose values\
    \ provide information\n   related to IP tunnel interfaces.  There are also a number\
    \ of objects\n   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create,\
    \ such\n   as those which allow an administrator to dynamically configure\n  \
    \ tunnels.\n   While unauthorized access to the readable objects is relatively\n\
    \   innocuous, unauthorized access to the write-able objects could cause\n   a\
    \ denial of service, or could cause unauthorized creation and/or\n   manipulation\
    \ of tunnels. Hence, the support for SET operations in a\n   non-secure environment\
    \ without proper protection can have a negative\n   effect on network operations.\n\
    \   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the\n   network\
    \ itself is secure (for example by using IPSec [24]), even\n   then, there is\
    \ no control as to who on the secure network is allowed\n   to access and SET\
    \ (change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.\n   It is recommended that the\
    \ implementers consider the security\n   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.\
    \  Specifically, the use\n   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and\
    \ the View-based\n   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.\n   It\
    \ is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity giving\
    \ access to this MIB, is properly configured to give\n   access to those objects\
    \ only to those principals (users) that have\n   legitimate rights to access them.\n"
