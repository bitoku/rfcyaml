- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document provides a terminology for benchmarking the Session\n\
    \   Initiation Protocol (SIP) performance of devices.  Methodology\n   related\
    \ to benchmarking SIP devices is described in the companion\n   methodology document\
    \ (RFC 7502).  Using these two documents,\n   benchmarks can be obtained and compared\
    \ for different types of\n   devices such as SIP Proxy Servers, Registrars, and\
    \ Session Border\n   Controllers.  The term \"performance\" in this context means\
    \ the\n   capacity of the Device Under Test (DUT) to process SIP messages.\n \
    \  Media streams are used only to study how they impact the signaling\n   behavior.\
    \  The intent of the two documents is to provide a normalized\n   set of tests\
    \ that will enable an objective comparison of the capacity\n   of SIP devices.\
    \  Test setup parameters and a methodology are\n   necessary because SIP allows\
    \ a wide range of configurations and\n   operational conditions that can influence\
    \ performance benchmark\n   measurements.  A standard terminology and methodology\
    \ will ensure\n   that benchmarks have consistent definitions and were obtained\n\
    \   following the same procedures.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Service Providers and IT organizations deliver Voice Over\
    \ IP (VoIP)\n   and multimedia network services based on the IETF Session Initiation\n\
    \   Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261].  SIP is a signaling protocol originally\n   intended\
    \ to be used to dynamically establish, disconnect, and modify\n   streams of media\
    \ between end users.  As it has evolved, it has been\n   adopted for use in a\
    \ growing number of services and applications.\n   Many of these result in the\
    \ creation of a media session, but some do\n   not.  Examples of this latter group\
    \ include text messaging and\n   subscription services.  The set of benchmarking\
    \ terms provided in\n   this document is intended for use with any SIP-enabled\
    \ device\n   performing SIP functions in the interior of the network, whether\
    \ or\n   not these result in the creation of media sessions.  The performance\n\
    \   of end-user devices is outside the scope of this document.\n   A number of\
    \ networking devices have been developed to support SIP-\n   based VoIP services.\
    \  These include SIP servers, Session Border\n   Controllers (SBCs), and Back-to-back\
    \ User Agents (B2BUAs).  These\n   devices contain a mix of voice and IP functions\
    \ whose performance may\n   be reported using metrics defined by the equipment\
    \ manufacturer or\n   vendor.  The Service Provider or IT organization seeking\
    \ to compare\n   the performance of such devices will not be able to do so using\
    \ these\n   vendor-specific metrics, whose conditions of test and algorithms for\n\
    \   collection are often unspecified.\n   SIP functional elements and the devices\
    \ that include them can be\n   configured many different ways and can be organized\
    \ into various\n   topologies.  These configuration and topological choices impact\
    \ the\n   value of any chosen signaling benchmark.  Unless these conditions of\n\
    \   test are defined, a true comparison of performance metrics across\n   multiple\
    \ vendor implementations will not be possible.\n   Some SIP-enabled devices terminate\
    \ or relay media as well as\n   signaling.  The processing of media by the device\
    \ impacts the\n   signaling performance.  As a result, the conditions of test\
    \ must\n   include information as to whether or not the Device Under Test\n  \
    \ processes media.  If the device processes media during the test, a\n   description\
    \ of the media must be provided.  This document and its\n   companion methodology\
    \ document [RFC7502] provide a set of black-box\n   benchmarks for describing\
    \ and comparing the performance of devices\n   that incorporate the SIP User Agent\
    \ Client and Server functions and\n   that operate in the network's core.\n  \
    \ The definition of SIP performance benchmarks necessarily includes\n   definitions\
    \ of Test Setup Parameters and a test methodology.  These\n   enable the Tester\
    \ to perform benchmarking tests on different devices\n   and to achieve comparable\
    \ results.  This document provides a common\n   set of definitions for Test Components,\
    \ Test Setup Parameters, and\n   Benchmarks.  All the benchmarks defined are black-box\
    \ measurements of\n   the SIP signaling plane.  The Test Setup Parameters and\
    \ Benchmarks\n   defined in this document are intended for use with the companion\n\
    \   methodology document.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Scope
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Scope\n   The scope of this document is summarized as follows:\n   o  This\
    \ terminology document describes SIP signaling performance\n      benchmarks for\
    \ black-box measurements of SIP networking devices.\n      Stress conditions and\
    \ debugging scenarios are not addressed in\n      this document.\n   o  The DUT\
    \ must be network equipment that is RFC 3261 capable.  This\n      may be a Registrar,\
    \ Redirect Server, or Stateful Proxy.  This\n      document does not require the\
    \ intermediary to assume the role of a\n      stateless proxy.  A DUT may also\
    \ act as a B2BUA or take the role\n      of an SBC.\n   o  The Tester acts as\
    \ multiple Emulated Agents (EAs) that initiate\n      (or respond to) SIP messages\
    \ as session endpoints and source (or\n      receive) associated media for established\
    \ connections.\n   o  Regarding SIP signaling in presence of media:\n      * \
    \ The media performance is not benchmarked.\n      *  Some tests require media,\
    \ but the use of media is limited to\n         observing the performance of SIP\
    \ signaling.  Tests that require\n         media will annotate the media characteristics\
    \ as a condition of\n         test.\n      *  The type of DUT dictates whether\
    \ the associated media streams\n         traverse the DUT.  Both scenarios are\
    \ within the scope of this\n         document.\n      *  SIP is frequently used\
    \ to create media streams; the signaling\n         plane and media plane are treated\
    \ as orthogonal to each other\n         in this document.  While many devices\
    \ support the creation of\n         media streams, benchmarks that measure the\
    \ performance of these\n         streams are outside the scope of this document\
    \ and its\n         companion methodology document [RFC7502].  Tests may be\n\
    \         performed with or without the creation of media streams.  The\n    \
    \     presence or absence of media streams MUST be noted as a\n         condition\
    \ of the test, as the performance of SIP devices may\n         vary accordingly.\
    \  Even if the media is used during\n         benchmarking, only the SIP performance\
    \ will be benchmarked, not\n         the media performance or quality.\n   o \
    \ Both INVITE and non-INVITE scenarios (registrations) are addressed\n      in\
    \ this document.  However, benchmarking SIP presence or\n      subscribe-notify\
    \ extensions is not a part of this document.\n   o  Different transport -- such\
    \ as UDP, TCP, SCTP, or TLS -- may be\n      used.  The specific transport mechanism\
    \ MUST be noted as a\n      condition of the test, as the performance of SIP devices\
    \ may vary\n      accordingly.\n   o  REGISTER and INVITE requests may be challenged\
    \ or remain\n      unchallenged for authentication purposes.  Whether or not the\n\
    \      REGISTER and INVITE requests are challenged is a condition of test\n  \
    \    that will be recorded along with other such parameters that may\n      impact\
    \ the SIP performance of the device or system under test.\n   o  Re-INVITE requests\
    \ are not considered within the scope of this\n      document since the benchmarks\
    \ for INVITEs are based on the dialog\n      created by the INVITE and not on\
    \ the transactions that take place\n      within that dialog.\n   o  Only session\
    \ establishment is considered for the performance\n      benchmarks.  Session\
    \ disconnect is not considered within the scope\n      of this document.  This\
    \ is because our goal is to determine the\n      maximum capacity of the device\
    \ or system under test, that is, the\n      number of simultaneous SIP sessions\
    \ that the device or system can\n      support.  It is true that there are BYE\
    \ requests being created\n      during the test process.  These transactions do\
    \ contribute to the\n      load on the device or system under test and thus are\
    \ accounted for\n      in the metric we derive.  We do not seek a separate metric\
    \ for the\n      number of BYE transactions a device or system can support.\n\
    \   o  Scenarios that are specific to the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)\n    \
    \  are not considered, but test cases can be applied with 3GPP-\n      specific\
    \ SIP signaling and the Proxy-Call Session Control Function\n      (P-CSCF) as\
    \ a DUT.\n   o  The benchmarks described in this document are intended for a\n\
    \      laboratory environment and are not intended to be used on a\n      production\
    \ network.  Some of the benchmarks send enough traffic\n      that a denial-of-service\
    \ attack is possible if used in production\n      networks.\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP\
    \ 14, RFC2119\n   [RFC2119].  RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help\
    \ make\n   the intent of Standards Track documents as clear as possible.  While\n\
    \   this document uses these keywords, this document is not a Standards\n   Track\
    \ document.\n   For the sake of clarity and continuity, this document adopts the\n\
    \   template for definitions set out in Section 2 of RFC 1242 [RFC1242].\n   The\
    \ term \"Device Under Test (DUT)\" is defined in Section 3.1.1 of RFC\n   2285\
    \ [RFC2285].\n   Many commonly used SIP terms in this document are defined in\
    \ RFC 3261\n   [RFC3261].  For convenience, the most important of these are\n\
    \   reproduced below.  Use of these terms in this document is consistent\n   with\
    \ their corresponding definition in the base SIP specification\n   [RFC3261] as\
    \ amended by [RFC4320], [RFC5393], and [RFC6026].\n   o  Call Stateful: A proxy\
    \ is call stateful if it retains state for a\n      dialog from the initiating\
    \ INVITE to the terminating BYE request.\n      A call stateful proxy is always\
    \ transaction stateful, but the\n      converse is not necessarily true.\n   o\
    \  Stateful Proxy: A logical entity, as defined by [RFC3261], that\n      maintains\
    \ the client and server transaction state machines during\n      the processing\
    \ of a request.  (Also known as a transaction\n      stateful proxy.)  The behavior\
    \ of a stateful proxy is further\n      defined in Section 16 of RFC 3261 [RFC3261]\
    \ .  A transaction\n      stateful proxy is not the same as a call stateful proxy.\n\
    \   o  Back-to-Back User Agent: A back-to-back user agent (B2BUA) is a\n     \
    \ logical entity that receives a request and processes it as a user\n      agent\
    \ server (UAS).  In order to determine how the request should\n      be answered,\
    \ it acts as a user agent client (UAC) and generates\n      requests.  Unlike\
    \ a proxy server, it maintains dialog state and\n      must participate in all\
    \ requests sent on the dialogs it has\n      established.  Since it is a concatenation\
    \ of a UAC and a UAS, no\n      explicit definitions are needed for its behavior.\n"

    \  In black-box\n      testing, the cause of the failure is not explored.  The\
    \ fact that\n      a failure occurred for whatever reason will trigger the tester\
