  - "Abstract\n   While the Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) supports\n\
    \   public key based authentication, the corresponding use of in-band\n   Certificate\
    \ Revocation Lists (CRL) is problematic due to unbounded\n   CRL size.  The size\
    \ of an Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)\n   response is however well-bounded\
    \ and small.  This document defines\n   the \"OCSP Content\" extension to IKEv2.\
    \  A CERTREQ payload with \"OCSP\n   Content\" identifies zero or more trusted\
    \ OCSP responders and is a\n   request for inclusion of an OCSP response in the\
    \ IKEv2 handshake.  A\n   cooperative recipient of such a request responds with\
    \ a CERT payload\n   containing the appropriate OCSP response.  This content is\n\
    \   recognizable via the same \"OCSP Content\" identifier.\n   When certificates\
    \ are used with IKEv2, the communicating peers need a\n   mechanism to determine\
    \ the revocation status of the peer's\n   certificate.  OCSP is one such mechanism.\
    \  This document applies when\n   OCSP is desired and security policy prevents\
    \ one of the IKEv2 peers\n   from accessing the relevant OCSP responder directly.\
    \  Firewalls are\n   often deployed in a manner that prevents such access by IKEv2\
    \ peers\n   outside of an enterprise network.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Version 2 of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol [IKEv2]\n\
    \   supports a range of authentication mechanisms, including the use of\n   public\
    \ key based authentication.  Confirmation of certificate\n   reliability is essential\
    \ in order to achieve the security assurances\n   public key cryptography provides.\
    \  One fundamental element of such\n   confirmation is reference to certificate\
    \ revocation status (see\n   [RFC3280] for additional detail).\n   The traditional\
    \ means of determining certificate revocation status is\n   through the use of\
    \ Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).  IKEv2 allows\n   CRLs to be exchanged\
    \ in-band via the CERT payload.\n   However, CRLs can grow unbounded in size.\
    \  Many real-world examples\n   exist to demonstrate the impracticality of including\
    \ a multi-megabyte\n   file in an IKE exchange.  This constraint is particularly\
    \ acute in\n   bandwidth-limited environments (e.g., mobile communications). \
    \ The\n   net effect is exclusion of in-band CRLs in favor of out-of-band (OOB)\n\
    \   acquisition of these data, should they even be used at all.\n   Reliance on\
    \ OOB methods can be further complicated if access to\n   revocation data requires\
    \ use of IPsec (and therefore IKE) to\n   establish secure and authorized access\
    \ to the CRLs of an IKE\n   participant.  Such network access deadlock further\
    \ contributes to a\n   reduced reliance on the status of certificate revocations\
    \ in favor of\n   blind trust.\n   OCSP [RFC2560] offers a useful alternative.\
    \  The size of an OCSP\n   response is bounded and small and therefore suitable\
    \ for in-band\n   IKEv2 signaling of a certificate's revocation status.\n   This\
    \ document defines an extension to IKEv2 that enables the use of\n   OCSP for\
    \ in-band signaling of certificate revocation status.  A new\n   content encoding\
    \ is defined for use in the CERTREQ and CERT payloads.\n   A CERTREQ payload with\
    \ \"OCSP Content\" identifies zero or more trusted\n   OCSP responders and is\
    \ a request for inclusion of an OCSP response in\n   the IKEv2 handshake.  A cooperative\
    \ recipient of such a request\n   responds with a CERT payload containing the\
    \ appropriate OCSP\n   response.  This content is recognizable via the same \"\
    OCSP Content\"\n   identifier.\n"

    \  Section 2.2 of [RFC2560] defines responses, which belong to\n   one of the\
    \ following three groups:\n   (a) the CA who issued the certificate\n   (b) a\
    \ Trusted Responder whose public key is trusted by the requester\n   (c) a CA\

    \ may issue OCSP responses for that\n       CA\n   In case of (a), the use of\

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Request for OCSP Support\n   Section 3.7 of [IKEv2] allows for the concatenation\
    \ of trust anchor\n   hashes as the Certification Authority value of a single\
    \ CERTREQ\n   message.  There is no means however to indicate which among those\n\
    \   hashes, if present, relates to the certificate of a trusted OCSP\n   responder.\n\
    \   Therefore, an OCSP request, as defined in Section 3.1 above, is\n   transmitted\
    \ separate from any other CERTREQ payloads in an IKEv2\n   exchange.\n   Where\
    \ it is useful to identify more than one trusted OCSP responder,\n   each such\
    \ identification SHALL be concatenated in a manner identical\n   to the method\
    \ documented in Section 3.7 of [IKEv2] regarding the\n   assembly of multiple\
    \ trust anchor hashes.\n   The Certification Authority value in an OCSP request\
    \ CERTREQ SHALL be\n   computed and produced in a manner identical to that of\
    \ trust anchor\n   hashes as documented in Section 3.7 of [IKEv2].\n   Upon receipt\
    \ of an OCSP response CERT payload corresponding to a\n   prior OCSP request CERTREQ,\
    \ the CERTREQ sender SHALL incorporate the\n   OCSP response into path validation\
    \ logic defined by [RFC3280].\n   Note that the lack of an OCSP response CERT\
    \ payload after sending an\n   OCSP request CERT payload might be an indication\
    \ that this OCSP\n   extension is not supported.  As a result, it is recommended\
    \ that\n   nodes be configured to require a response only if it is known that\n\
    \   all peers do in fact support this extension.  Otherwise, it is\n   recommended\
    \ that the nodes be configured to try OCSP and, if there is\n   no response, attempt\
    \ to determine certificate revocation status by\n   some other means.\n"

    \   Initiator sends in (3) both a CERT payload carrying its certificate\n   and\
    \ an OCSP response CERT payload covering that certificate.  In (3),\n   Initiator\
    \ also requests an OCSP response via the OCSP request CERTREQ\n   payload.  In\
    \ (4), the Responder returns its certificate and a\n   separate OCSP response\
    \ CERT payload covering that certificate.\n   It is important to note that in\
    \ this scenario, the Responder in (2)\n   does not yet possess the Initiator's\
    \ certificate and therefore cannot\n   form an OCSP request as defined in [RFC2560].\
    \  To bypass this\n   problem, hashes are used as defined in Section 4.1.  In\
    \ such\n   instances, OCSP Requests are simply index values into these data.\n\
    \   Thus, it is easily inferred that OCSP responses can be produced in\n   the\
    \ absence of a corresponding request (provided that OCSP nonces are\n   not used,\
    \ see Section 6).\n   It is also important in extending IKEv2 toward OCSP in this\
    \ scenario\n   that the Initiator has certain knowledge that the Responder is\n\
    \   capable of and willing to participate in the extension.  Yet the\n   Responder\
    \ will only trust one or more OCSP responder signatures.\n   These factors motivate\
    \ the definition of OCSP responder hash\n   extension.\n"
