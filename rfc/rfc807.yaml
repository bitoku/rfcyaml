  - "Overview:\n   This meeting was called to discuss common interests in multi-media\n\
    \   computer mail experiments, and to agree on some specific initial\n   experiments.\n"

  - "Review of Status:\n   Review current status of multimedia efforts at CMU, ISI,\
    \ MIT, COMSAT,\n   BBN, UCL, SRI.\n   CMU\n      Using PERQ, Quip for fax, LPCM\
    \ vocoder from LL, will get NEC board\n      (3 chips) to replace vocoder.  Will\
    \ have a stand alone voice I/O\n      device that operates at 2400 baud (not packetized).\
    \ Not working on\n      IP/TCP.  Will use the IP and TCP from the BBN project.\
    \ Already\n      using the BBN Jericho developed Pascal IP and CFTP. Interested\
    \ in\n      word recognition of LPC digitized voice data. Planning to package\n\
    \      a synthesiser, an analyzer, and a pitch tracker on one board.\n   ISI\n\
    \      Using TOPS20 (code in BLISS10), and starting to use PERQ (code in\n   \
    \   Pascal), RAPICOM 450 for fax.  Main interest is in the data\n      structuring\
    \ and message transport protocols.\n   MIT\n      Using Apollos, will program\
    \ in MDL.  Use of Apollos still limited\n      due to (1) MDL not completely implemented,\
    \ (2) network interface\n      not yet available (waiting on multibus  to then\
    \ interface to\n      Ethernet). Will get NEC CCITT fax machine. Looking into\
    \ VAX+BBN\n      BitGraph for future.  Main work to date in  design for sharing\n\
    \      message data in a conceptualy centralized filing system.  Emphasis\n"

    \    on efficient storage and manipulation of multirecipient messages,\n     \
    \ enclosures, citations, etc.\n   COMSAT\n      Using small 11s, Rapicom 450 and\
    \ 500 fax machines, also have some\n      LPC vocoders.  Substantial work has\
    \ been done on encoding and\n      decoding both Rapicom 450 and CCITT T.4 fax\
    \ data, and also on\n      manipulation of bitmap data (See RFC 803).\n   BBN\n\
    \      Using Jericho (code in Pascal). Will be building a prototype\n      system\
    \ with the aim of investigating problems of data distribution\n      and privacy.\
    \  Trying to produce portable software currently in\n      Pascal but may switch\
    \ to ADA in the distant future.  Have IP and\n      CFTP running, working on TCP.\
    \ CFTP is a file transfer built\n      directly on IP.\n   UCL\n      Using LSI-11,\
    \ Rapicom 450 fax machine, Grinell bitmap display.\n      May get PERQs (produced\
    \ by ICL) in future.  Have done quite a lot\n      of work on encoding/decoding\
    \ for the Rapicom 450, and in bitmap\n      manipulations (e.g., cleanup of noise,\
    \ scaling, cut and paste).\n      Interests in the relation of other types of\
    \ display protocols to\n      multimedia effort e.g., VIDEOTEXT and TELETEXT.\n\
    \   SRI\n      There are three multimedia mail projects at SRI,sponsored by DCEC,\n\
    \      ARPA, and NAVELEX.  SRI is a subcontractor (with Sytek and DTI) to\n  \
    \    SDC in the DCEC program to produce protocol specifications for the\n    \
    \  DoD.  SRI has written service specifications for a mail system\n      similar\
    \ to RFC759+767 with security features added.  The ARPA\n      project is studying\
    \ the issues involved in a multimedia mail\n      architecture based on RFC759+767,\
    \ including negotiations,\n      envelopes, and multilevel security.  The NAVELEX\
    \ project is\n      investigating user interfaces for command and control\n  \
    \    workstations, including natural language access to a data base.\n      The\
    \ plan is to use RFC759+767 data structures to communicate text\n      and graphics,\
    \ implemented on Foonly F-5s running Tenex with\n      Foo-Vision displays.  The\
    \ current choice for the graphics protocol\n      is Bisbey's GL2.\n"

- title: 'Discussion:'
  contents:
  - "Discussion:\n   Coding/Decoding Algorithm:\n      We agree to use the encoding\
    \ specified in the CCITT T.4\n      recommendation for the exchange of black and\
    \ white bitmap data.\n   New Equipment:\n      It is reported that soon NEC will\
    \ have CCITT T.4 Group 3 Fax\n      machines for about $15K.\n   NBS Mail Standard:\n\
    \      The possibility that the NBS Mail Format Standard is a workable\n     \
    \ alternative to the RFC759+767 protocol is to be studied.  What is\n      the\
    \ relationship between these standards?  Do we have comment on\n      the NBS\
    \ Standard to submit to NBS?\n   Equipment Variations:\n      What happens if\
    \ the receiver does not have equipment capable of\n      protraying some of the\
    \ data (e.g., dosen't have a  LPC vocoder)?\n      There are three subtopics:\
    \  How many \"standard\" forms are\n      allowed?, What do you tell the user\
    \ if you can't do it?, and How\n      does the cost of a medium (in memory or\
    \ cpu cycles or portrayal\n      time) effect its use? The general feeling was\
    \ that if there is\n      some type of data the receiving system can't portray,\
    \ it should\n      simply tell the user \"There is some data here I can't portray\
    \ and\n      it's type is x.\". The other aspects are items for further study.\n\
    \   Negotiation:\n      Does negotiation make sense in a mail system?  What are\
    \ the kinds\n      of things to be negotiated?  One possiblity is to initially\
    \ send\n      only pointers to the sections of a message, and have the recipient\n\
    \      system ask for the parts it can handle.  Does this make sense in a\n  \
    \    message relaying environment?  Or for messsages with a fine scale\n     \
    \ interleaving of media types?  This topic is for further study.\n   Enclosures,\
    \ Pointers, Cross References:\n      This seems too complex to handle at this\
    \ meeting, so for now send\n      the whole thing.  This is an item for further\
    \ study.\n   Editing Multimedia Objects:\n      This is one of the most interesting\
    \ parts of these research\n"

    \    projects, so each group will develop their own techniques, and we\n     \
    \ will compare notes.\n   Manipulation of Bitmaps:\n      The issues involve aspect\
    \ ratios, cut and paste, rotation  and,\n      scaling. We need to compare notes\
    \ and exchange algorithms.  An\n      item for further study.\n   Mailbox IDs\
    \ and Control Information:\n      With different types of source hosts and destination\
    \ host\n      (timsharing systems, personal computers) and different types of\n\
    \      mail delivery schemes (append to file, query database server), do\n   \
    \   we have sufficient control mechanisms and addressing modes?  This\n      is\
    \ an item for further study.\n   Storage and Transmission:\n      How do the requirements\
    \ for memory, disk, cpu, and transmission\n      capacity differ for multimedia\
    \ mail from text mail? This is an\n      item for further study.\n   Multimedia\
    \ Virtual Message Format:\n      It is not clear that this is anything different\
    \ than what is\n      specified by RFC759+767, but since it was not fully discussed\
    \ it\n      is an item for further study.\n   Media Specific Protocols:\n    \
    \  Specific format definitions are needed for each media.  This is an\n      item\
    \ for further study.\n   Interfaces to Other Systems:\n      How do we interface\
    \ this multimeda system to opther systems (e.g.,\n      TELETEXT, VIDEOTEXT),\
    \ and to text only mail systems (e.g.,\n      ARPAMAIL, TELEMAIL, ONTYM).  This\
    \ is an item for further study.\n"
