- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME)\
    \ [RFC8555]\n   only defines challenges for validating control of DNS host name\n\
    \   identifiers, which limits its use to being used for issuing\n   certificates\
    \ for DNS identifiers.  In order to allow validation of\n   IPv4 and IPv6 identifiers\
    \ for inclusion in X.509 certificates, this\n   document specifies how challenges\
    \ defined in the original ACME\n   specification and the TLS-ALPN extension specification\
    \ [RFC8737] can\n   be used to validate IP identifiers.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\n\
    \   capitals, as shown here.\n"
- title: 3.  IP Identifier
  contents:
  - "3.  IP Identifier\n   [RFC8555] only defines the identifier type \"dns\", which\
    \ is used to\n   refer to fully qualified domain names.  If an ACME server wishes\
    \ to\n   request proof that a user controls an IPv4 or IPv6 address, it MUST\n\
    \   create an authorization with the identifier type \"ip\".  The value\n   field\
    \ of the identifier MUST contain the textual form of the address\n   as defined\
    \ in Section 2.1 of [RFC1123] for IPv4 and in Section 4 of\n   [RFC5952] for IPv6.\n\
    \   An identifier for the IPv6 address 2001:db8::1 would be formatted\n   like\
    \ so:\n   {\"type\": \"ip\", \"value\": \"2001:db8::1\"}\n"
- title: 4.  Identifier Validation Challenges
  contents:
  - "4.  Identifier Validation Challenges\n   IP identifiers MAY be used with the\
    \ existing \"http-01\" (see\n   Section 8.3 of [RFC8555]) and \"tls-alpn-01\"\
    \ (see Section 3 of\n   [RFC8737]).  To use IP identifiers with these challenges,\
    \ their\n   initial DNS resolution step MUST be skipped, and the IP address used\n\
    \   for validation MUST be the value of the identifier.\n"
- title: 5.  HTTP Challenge
  contents:
  - "5.  HTTP Challenge\n   For the \"http-01\" challenge, the Host header field MUST\
    \ be set to the\n   IP address being used for validation per [RFC7230].  The textual\
    \ form\n   of this address MUST be as defined in Section 2.1 of [RFC1123] for\n\
    \   IPv4 and in Section 4 of [RFC5952] for IPv6.\n"
- title: 6.  TLS with Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (TLS ALPN) Challenge
  contents:
  - "6.  TLS with Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (TLS ALPN) Challenge\n  \
    \ For the \"tls-alpn-01\" challenge, the subjectAltName extension in the\n   validation\
    \ certificate MUST contain a single iPAddress that matches\n   the address being\
    \ validated.  As [RFC6066] does not permit IP\n   addresses to be used in the\
    \ Server Name Indication (SNI) extension\n   HostName field, the server MUST instead\
    \ use the IN-ADDR.ARPA\n   [RFC1034] or IP6.ARPA [RFC3596] reverse mapping of\
    \ the IP address as\n   the HostName field value instead of the IP address string\n\
    \   representation itself.  For example, if the IP address being\n   validated\
    \ is 2001:db8::1, the SNI HostName field should contain \"1.0.\n   0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa\"\

- title: 9.1.  Certification Authority (CA) Policy Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.1.  Certification Authority (CA) Policy Considerations\n   This document only\
    \ specifies how an ACME server may validate that a\n   certificate applicant controls\
    \ an IP identifier at the time of\n   validation.  The CA may wish to perform\
    \ additional checks not\n   specified in this document.  For example, if the CA\
    \ believes an IP\n   identifier belongs to an ISP or cloud service provider with\
    \ short\n   delegation periods, they may wish to impose additional restrictions\n\
    \   on certificates requested for that identifier.\n"
