  - "2. Command meanings\n   As described in the NAOL and NAOP option specifications,\
    \ this option applies\n   to a simplex connection.\n      IAC DO STATUS \n   \
    \      Sender of DO wishes to be able to send requests for status-of-options \n\
    \         information, or confirms that he is willing to send such requests.\n\
    \      IAC WILL STATUS \n         Sender of WILL wishes or agrees to send status\
    \ information, \n         spontaneously or in response to future requests.\n \
    \     IAC DON'T STATUS \n         Sender refuses to carry on any further discussion\
    \ of the current \n         status of options.\n      IAC WON'T STATUS \n    \
    \     Sender refuses to carry on any further discussion of the current \n    \
    \     status of options.\n      IAC SB STATUS SEND IAC SE\n         Sender requests\
    \ receiver to transmit his (the receiver's) perception \n         of the current\
    \ status of Telnet options. The code for SEND is 1. (See \n         below.)\n\
    \      IAC SB STATUS IS ... IAC SE \n         Sender is stating his perception\
    \ of the current status of Telnet \n         options. The code for IS is 0. (See\
    \ below.)\n"

  contents:
  - "3. Default\n   DON'T STATUS/WON'T STATUS. That is, the current status of options\
    \ will not \n   be discussed.\n"
- title: 4. Motivation for the option
  contents:
  - "4. Motivation for the option\n   This option allows a user/process to verify\
    \ the current status of Telnet \n   options (e.g., echoing) as viewed by the person/process\
    \ on the other end of \n   the Telnet connection. Simply renegotiating options\
    \ could lead to the \n   nonterminating request loop problem discussed in (NIC\
    \ #16237). The changes \n   to the option, described in this paper, allow STATUS\
    \ to fit into the normal \n   structure of Telnet options, by deferring the actual\
    \ transfer of status \n   information to the SB command. Additionally, the numbers\
    \ of bytes that must \n   be sent to describe the state of the options has been\
    \ considerably reduced.\n"
- title: 5. Description of the option
  contents:
  - "5. Description of the option\n   WILL/DO are now used only to obtain and grant\
    \ permission for future \n   discussion. The actual exchange of status information\
    \ occurs within option \n   subcommands (IAC SB STATUS...).\n   Once the two hosts\
    \ have exchanged a WILL and a DO, the sender of the WILL \n   STATUS is free to\
    \ transmit status information, spontaneously or in response \n   to a request\
    \ from the sender of the DO. At worst, this may lead to \n   transmitting the\
    \ information twice. Only the sender of the DO may send \n   requests (IAC SB\
    \ STATUS SEND IAC SE) and only the sender of the WILL may \n   transmit actual\
    \ status information (within an IAC SB STATUS IS ... IAC SE \n   command).\n \
    \  IS has the subcommands WILL, DO and SB. They are used EXACTLY as used during\n\
    \   the actual negotiation of Telnet options, except that SB is terminated with\
    \ \n   SE, rather than IAC SE. Transmission of SE, as a regular data byte, is\
    \ \n   accomplished by doubling the byte (SE SE). Options that are not explicitly\
    \ \n   described are assumed to be in their default states. A single IAC SB STATUS\
    \ \n   IS ... IAC SE describes the condition of ALL options.\n   The following\
    \ is an example of use of the option:\n      Host1: IAC DO STATUS\n      Host2:\
    \ IAC WILL STATUS\n         (Host2 is now free to send status information at any\
    \ time. \n         Solicitations from Host1 are NOT necessary. This should not\
    \ produce \n         any dangerous race conditions. At worst, two IS's will be\
    \ sent.\n      Host1 (perhaps): IAC SB STATUS SEND IAC SE\n      Host2 (the following\
    \ stream is broken into multiple lines only for \n      readability. No carriage\
    \ returns are implied.):\n         IAC SB STATUS IS\n         WILL ECHO\n    \
    \     DO SUPPRESS-GO-AHEAD\n         WILL STATUS\n         DO STATUS\n       \
    \  WILL RCTE\n         SB RCTE <11><1><24> SE\n         DO NAOL\n         SB NAOL\
    \ DS <66> SE\n         IAC SE\n      Explanation of Host2's perceptions: It is\
    \ responsible for echoing back \n      the data characters it receives over the\
    \ Telnet connection; it will not \n"
