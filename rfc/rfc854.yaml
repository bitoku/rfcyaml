  - "INTRODUCTION\n   The purpose of the TELNET Protocol is to provide a fairly general,\n
    \  bi-directional, eight-bit byte oriented communications facility.  Its\n   primary
    goal is to allow a standard method of interfacing terminal\n   devices and terminal-oriented
    processes to each other.  It is\n   envisioned that the protocol may also be used
    for terminal-terminal\n   communication (\"linking\") and process-process communication\n
    \  (distributed computation).\n"

  - "GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\n   A TELNET connection is a Transmission Control Protocol
    (TCP)\n   connection used to transmit data with interspersed TELNET control\n
    \  information.\n   The TELNET Protocol is built upon three main ideas:  first,
    the\n   concept of a \"Network Virtual Terminal\"; second, the principle of\n
    \  negotiated options; and third, a symmetric view of terminals and\n   processes.\n
    \  1.  When a TELNET connection is first established, each end is\n   assumed
    to originate and terminate at a \"Network Virtual Terminal\",\n   or NVT.  An
    NVT is an imaginary device which provides a standard,\n   network-wide, intermediate
    representation of a canonical terminal.\n   This eliminates the need for \"server\"
    and \"user\" hosts to keep\n   information about the characteristics of each other's
    terminals and\n   terminal handling conventions.  All hosts, both user and server,
    map\n   their local device characteristics and conventions so as to appear to\n
    \  be dealing with an NVT over the network, and each can assume a\n   similar
    mapping by the other party.  The NVT is intended to strike a\n   balance between
    being overly restricted (not providing hosts a rich\n   enough vocabulary for
    mapping into their local character sets), and\n   being overly inclusive (penalizing
    users with modest terminals).\n      NOTE:  The \"user\" host is the host to which
    the physical terminal\n      is normally attached, and the \"server\" host is
    the host which is\n      normally providing some service.  As an alternate point
    of view,\n"

  - "THE NETWORK VIRTUAL TERMINAL\n   The Network Virtual Terminal (NVT) is a bi-directional
    character\n   device.  The NVT has a printer and a keyboard.  The printer responds\n
    \  to incoming data and the keyboard produces outgoing data which is\n   sent
    over the TELNET connection and, if \"echoes\" are desired, to the\n   NVT's printer
    as well.  \"Echoes\" will not be expected to traverse the\n   network (although
    options exist to enable a \"remote\" echoing mode of\n   operation, no host is
    required to implement this option).  The code\n   set is seven-bit USASCII in
    an eight-bit field, except as modified\n   herein.  Any code conversion and timing
    considerations are local\n   problems and do not affect the NVT.\n   TRANSMISSION
    OF DATA\n      Although a TELNET connection through the network is intrinsically\n
    \     full duplex, the NVT is to be viewed as a half-duplex device\n      operating
    in a line-buffered mode.  That is, unless and until\n"

  - "TELNET COMMAND STRUCTURE\n   All TELNET commands consist of at least a two byte
    sequence:  the\n   \"Interpret as Command\" (IAC) escape character followed by
    the code\n   for the command.  The commands dealing with option negotiation are\n
    \  three byte sequences, the third byte being the code for the option\n   referenced.
    \ This format was chosen so that as more comprehensive use\n   of the \"data space\"
    is made -- by negotiations from the basic NVT, of\n   course -- collisions of
    data bytes with reserved command values will\n   be minimized, all such collisions
    requiring the inconvenience, and\n"

  - "CONNECTION ESTABLISHMENT\n   The TELNET TCP connection is established between
    the user's port U\n   and the server's port L.  The server listens on its well
    known port L\n   for such connections.  Since a TCP connection is full duplex
    and\n   identified by the pair of ports, the server can engage in many\n   simultaneous
    connections involving its port L and different user\n   ports U.\n   Port Assignment\n
    \     When used for remote user access to service hosts (i.e., remote\n      terminal
    access) this protocol is assigned server port 23\n      (27 octal).  That is L=23.\n"
