  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies the 'tn3270' Uniform Resource Identifier\n\
    \   (URI) scheme, which is used to designate the access to the resources\n   available\
    \ via Telnet 3270 mode (TN3270) and Telnet 3270 Enhanced mode\n   (TN3270E).\n\
    \   Telnet 3270 mode (TN3270) is a name used to denote the special mode\n   of\
    \ Telnet session [RFC0854].  If it is used, the 3270 data stream\n   [GA23-0059]\
    \ is used when transmitting data during the Telnet session,\n   whereas the Telnet\
    \ 3270 Regime option [RFC1041] is used to enable and\n   negotiate its use.  (See\
    \ [RFC1576] for some other background\n   information on TN3270.)  Telnet 3270\
    \ Enhanced mode (TN3270E) has a\n   similar principle; see RFC 2355 [RFC2355]\
    \ for its specification.\n   The 'tn3270' URI scheme was firstly mentioned in\
    \ RFC 1738 [RFC1738]\n   as used in URIs that designate the access to \"Interactive\
    \ 3270\n   emulation sessions\".  Following the creation of the URI schemes\n\
    \   registry per RFC 4395 [RFC4395], this scheme was added to the\n   \"Provisional\
    \ URI Schemes\" sub-registry in the \"Uniform Resource\n   Identifier (URI) Schemes\"\
    \ IANA registry [URIREG].  However, RFC 1738\n   [RFC1738] does not give any definition\
    \ of syntax or semantics of the\n   'tn3270' URIs and does not have any guidelines\
    \ for registration of\n   this scheme.\n   Since there is no acceptable specification\
    \ of the 'tn3270' URI, there\n   is a risk that somebody might try to implement\
    \ it with some new,\n   possibly undocumented, syntax, just by looking at the\
    \ IANA registry.\n   In order to minimize such risk, this document gives a precise\n\
    \   definition of syntax, semantics, use of this URI, and it registers\n   the\
    \ corresponding scheme.  It also updates RFC 2355 [RFC2355], RFC\n   1738 [RFC1738],\
    \ and RFC 1041 [RFC1041].\n   The generic syntax of URIs is described in RFC 3986\
    \ [RFC3986].\n   Registration procedures for new URI schemes are defined in RFC\
    \ 4395\n   [RFC4395].\n"

- title: 2.1.  URI Scheme Syntax
  contents:
  - "2.1.  URI Scheme Syntax\n   The 'tn3270' URI takes the following form (the syntax\
    \ below is non-\n   normative):\n      tn3270://<userinfo>@<host>:<port>/\n  \
    \ where the <userinfo> part with the \"@\" (at) sign character, as well\n   as\
    \ the <port> part with the preceding \":\" (colon) character, is\n   OPTIONAL.\n\
    \   The normative syntax of the 'tn3270' URI is defined in <tn3270-uri>\n   ABNF\
    \ [RFC5234] rule:\n     tn3270-uri       = \"tn3270:\" \"//\" authority [\"/\"\
    ]\n   where the <authority> rule is specified in RFC 3986 [RFC3986].\n   The semantics\
    \ of each part of the 'tn3270' URI are defined below, in\n   Section 2.2.\n"
- title: 2.2. URI Scheme Semantics
  contents:
  - "2.2. URI Scheme Semantics\n   The <host> part of the 'tn3270' URI, which is REQUIRED,\
    \ denotes the\n   host to which the TN3270 or TN3270E connection is to be established.\n\
    \   The <userinfo> part is considered to define the information for use\n   in\
    \ the Telnet Authentication option [RFC2941], which might be used\n   during the\
    \ TN3270 or TN3270E session.  The <port> part, if present,\n   denotes the port\
    \ on which the TCP connection to the <host> is to be\n   established.  If it is\
    \ absent, the default port SHALL be 23, as\n   registered in [PORTREG].\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   Generic security considerations for the usage\
    \ of URIs are discussed\n   in Section 7 of [RFC3986].\n   Since 'tn3270' URIs\
    \ provide access to services that are available via\n   TN3270 and TN3270E, which\
    \ do not add any new security issues to the\n   Telnet session, as they are a\
    \ modified form of it, there are no other\n   security considerations for 'tn3270'\
    \ URIs that are not discussed in\n   RFC 4248 [RFC4248], the 'telnet' URI scheme\
    \ specification.\n   The Telnet protocol, as well as TN3270 and TN3270E, is inherently\n\
    \   insecure.  Those needing remote login access and related services are\n  \
    \ encouraged to use a more secure technology, such as Secure Shell\n   [RFC4251].\n"
