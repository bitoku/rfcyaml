  - "1.  Introduction\n   Voice over IP (VoIP) typically uses the encapsulation\n\
    \   voice/RTP/UDP/IP.  When MPLS labels [MPLS-ARCH] are added, this\n   becomes\
    \ voice/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS-labels.  For an MPLS Virtual Private\n   Network (VPN)\
    \ (e.g., [MPLS-VPN]), the packet header is at least 48\n   bytes, while the voice\
    \ payload is often no more than 30 bytes, for\n   example.  The interest in header\
    \ compression (HC) is to exploit the\n   possibility of significantly reducing\
    \ the overhead through various\n   compression mechanisms, such as with enhanced\
    \ compressed RTP [ECRTP]\n   or robust header compression [ROHC], and also to\
    \ increase scalability\n   of HC.  We consider using MPLS to route compressed\
    \ packets over an\n   MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) without compression/decompression\n\
    \   cycles at each router.  Such an HC over MPLS capability can increase\n   bandwidth\
    \ efficiency as well as the processing scalability of the\n   maximum number of\
    \ simultaneous flows that use HC at each router.\n   To implement HC over MPLS,\
    \ the ingress router/gateway would have to\n   apply the HC algorithm to the IP\
    \ packet, the compressed packet routed\n   on an MPLS LSP using MPLS labels, and\
    \ the compressed header would be\n   decompressed at the egress router/gateway\
    \ where the HC session\n   terminates.  Figure 1 illustrates an HC over MPLS session\
    \ established\n   on an LSP that crosses several routers, from R1/HC --> R2 -->\
    \ R3 -->\n   R4/HD, where R1/HC is the ingress router where HC is performed, and\n\
    \   R4/HD is the egress router where header decompression (HD) is done.\n   HC\
    \ of the RTP/UDP/IP header is performed at R1/HC, and the compressed\n   packets\
    \ are routed using MPLS labels from R1/HC to R2, to R3, and\n   finally to R4/HD,\
    \ without further decompression/recompression cycles.\n   The RTP/UDP/IP header\
    \ is decompressed at R4/HD and can be forwarded\n   to other routers, as needed.\n\

- title: 2.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "2.  Problem Statement\n   As described in the introduction, HC over MPLS can\
    \ significantly\n   reduce the header overhead through HC mechanisms.  The need\
    \ for HC\n   may be important on low-speed links where bandwidth is more scarce,\n\
    \   but it could also be important on backbone facilities, especially\n   where\
    \ costs are high (e.g., some global cross-sections).  VoIP\n   typically will\
    \ use voice compression mechanisms (e.g., G.729) on\n   low-speed and international\
    \ routes, in order to conserve bandwidth.\n   With HC, significantly more bandwidth\
    \ could be saved.  For example,\n   carrying uncompressed headers for the entire\
    \ voice load of a large\n   domestic network with 300 million or more calls per\
    \ day could consume\n   on the order of about 20-40 gigabits per second on the\
    \ backbone\n   network for headers alone.  This overhead could translate into\n\
    \   considerable bandwidth capacity.\n   The claim is often made that once fiber\
    \ is in place, increasing the\n   bandwidth capacity is inexpensive, nearly 'free'.\
    \  This may be true\n   in some cases; however, on some international cross-sections,\n\
    \   especially, facility/transport costs are very high and saving\n   bandwidth\
    \ on such backbone links is very worthwhile.  Decreasing the\n   backbone bandwidth\
    \ is needed in some areas of the world where\n   bandwidth is very expensive.\
    \  It is also important in almost all\n   locations to decrease the bandwidth\
    \ consumption on low-speed links.\n   So although bandwidth is getting cheaper,\
    \ the value of compression\n   does not go away.  It should be further noted that\
    \ IPv6 will increase\n   the size of headers, and therefore increase the importance\
    \ of HC for\n   RTP flows.\n   Although hop-by-hop HC could be applied to decrease\
    \ bandwidth\n   requirements, that implies a processing requirement for compression-\n\
    \   decompression cycles at every router hop, which does not scale well\n   for\
    \ large voice traffic loads.  The maximum number of compressed RTP\n   (cRTP)\
    \ flows is about 30-50 for a typical customer premise router,\n   depending upon\
    \ its uplink speed and processing power, while the need\n   may exceed 300-500\
    \ for a high-end case.  Therefore, HC over MPLS\n   seems to be a viable alternative\
    \ to get the compression benefits\n   without introducing costly processing demands\
    \ on the intermediate\n   nodes.  By using HC over MPLS, routers merely forward\
    \ compressed\n   packets without doing a decompression/recompression cycle, thereby\n\
    \   increasing the maximum number of simultaneous compressed flows that\n   routers\
    \ can handle.\n   Therefore, the proposal is to use existing HC techniques, together\n\
    \   with MPLS labels, to make the transport of the RTP/UDP/IP headers\n   more\
    \ efficient over an MPLS network.  However, at this time, there\n   are no standards\
    \ for HC over MPLS, and vendors have not implemented\n   such techniques.\n"

- title: 3.  Goals and Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  Goals and Requirements\n   The goals of HC over MPLS are as follows:\n  \
    \ a. provide more efficient voice transport over MPLS networks,\n   b. increase\
    \ the scalability of HC to a large number of flows,\n   c. not significantly increase\
    \ packet delay, delay variation, or loss\n      probability, and\n   d. leverage\
    \ existing work through use of standard protocols as much\n      as possible.\n\
    \   Therefore the requirements for HC over MPLS are as follows:\n   a. MUST use\
    \ existing protocols (e.g., [ECRTP], [ROHC]) to compress\n      RTP/UDP/IP headers,\
    \ in order to provide for efficient transport,\n      tolerance to packet loss,\
    \ and resistance to loss of session\n      context.\n   b. MUST allow HC over\
    \ an MPLS LSP, and thereby avoid hop-by-hop\n      compression/decompression cycles\
    \ (e.g., [HC-MPLS-PROTO]).\n   c. MUST minimize incremental performance degradation\
    \ due to increased\n      delay, packet loss, and jitter.\n   d. MUST use standard\
    \ protocols to signal context identification and\n      control information (e.g.,\
    \ [RSVP], [RSVP-TE], [LDP]).\n   e. Packet reordering MUST NOT cause incorrectly\
    \ decompressed packets\n      to be forwarded from the decompressor.\n   It is\
    \ necessary that the HC method be able to handle out-of-sequence\n   packets.\
    \  MPLS [MPLS-ARCH] enables 4-byte labels to be appended to IP\n   packets to\
    \ allow switching from the ingress Label Switching Router\n   (LSR) to the egress\
    \ LSP on an LSP through an MPLS network.  However,\n   MPLS does not guarantee\
    \ that packets will arrive in order at the\n   egress LSR, since a number of things\
    \ could cause packets to be\n   delivered out of sequence.  For example, a link\
    \ failure could cause\n   the LSP routing to change, due perhaps to an MPLS fast\
    \ reroute taking\n   place, or to the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) and Label\n\
    \   Distribution Protocol (LDP) converging to another route, among other\n   possible\
    \ reasons.  Other causes could include IGP reroutes due to\n   'loose hops' in\
    \ the LSP, or BGP route changes reflecting back into\n   IGP reroutes.  HC algorithms\
    \ may be able to handle reordering\n   magnitudes on the order of about 10 packets,\
    \ which may make the time\n   required for IGP reconvergence (typically on the\
    \ order of seconds)\n   untenable for the HC algorithm.  On the other hand, MPLS\
    \ fast reroute\n   may be fast enough (on the order of 50 ms or less) for the\
    \ HC\n   algorithm to handle packet reordering.  The issue of reordering needs\n\
    \   to be further considered in the development of the HC over MPLS\n   solution.\n\
    \   Resynchronization and performance also needs to be considered, since\n   HC\
    \ over MPLS can sometimes have multiple routers in the LSP.\n   Tunneling an HC\
    \ session over an MPLS LSP with multiple routers in the\n   path will increase\
    \ the round-trip delay and the chance of packet\n   loss, and HC contexts may\
    \ be invalidated due to packet loss.  The HC\n   error recovery mechanism can\
    \ compound the problem when long round-\n   trip delays are involved.\n"
- title: 4.  Candidate Solution Methods and Needs
  contents:
  - "4.  Candidate Solution Methods and Needs\n   [cRTP] performs best with very low\
    \ packet error rates on all hops of\n   the path.  When the cRTP decompressor\
    \ context state gets out of synch\n   with the compressor, it will drop packets\
    \ associated with the context\n   until the two states are resynchronized.  To\
    \ resynchronize context\n   state at the two ends, the decompressor transmits\
    \ the CONTEXT_STATE\n   packet to the compressor, and the compressor transmits\
    \ a FULL_HEADER\n   packet to the decompressor.\n   [ECRTP] uses mechanisms that\
    \ make cRTP more tolerant to packet loss,\n   and ECRTP thereby helps to minimize\
    \ the use of feedback-based error\n   recovery (CONTEXT_STATE packets).  ECRTP\
    \ is therefore a candidate\n   method to make HC over MPLS more tolerant of packet\
    \ loss and to guard\n   against frequent resynchronizations.  ECRTP may need some\n\
    \   implementation adaptations to address the reordering requirement in\n   Section\
    \ 3 (requirement e), since a default implementation will\n   probably not meet\
    \ the requirement.  ECRTP protocol extensions may be\n   required to identify\
    \ FULL_HEADER, CONTEXT_STATE, and compressed\n   packet types.  [cRTP-ENCAP] specifies\
    \ a separate link-layer packet\n   type defined for HC.  Using a separate link-layer\
    \ packet type avoids\n   the need to add extra bits to the compression header\
    \ to identify the\n   packet type.  However, this approach does not extend well\
    \ to MPLS\n   encapsulation conventions [MPLS-ENCAP], in which a separate link-\n\
    \   layer packet type translates into a separate LSP for each packet\n   type.\
    \  In order to extend ECRTP to HC over MPLS, each packet type\n   defined in [ECRTP]\
    \ would need to be identified in an appended packet\n   type field in the ECRTP\
    \ header.\n   [ROHC] is also very tolerant of packet loss, and therefore is a\n\
    \   candidate method to guard against frequent resynchronizations.  ROHC\n   also\
    \ achieves a somewhat better level of compression as compared to\n   ECRTP.  ROHC\
    \ may need some implementation adaptations to address the\n   reordering requirement\
    \ in Section 3 (requirement e), since a default\n   implementation will probably\
    \ not meet the requirement (see\n   [ROHC-REORD]).  ROHC already has the capability\
    \ to identify the\n   packet type in the compression header, so no further extension\
    \ is\n   needed to identify packet type.\n   Extensions to MPLS signaling may\
    \ be needed to identify the LSP from\n   HC to HD egress point, negotiate the\
    \ HC algorithm used and protocol\n   parameters, and negotiate the Session Context\
    \ IDs (SCIDs) space\n   between the ingress and egress routers on the MPLS LSP.\
    \  For example,\n   new objects may need to be defined for [RSVP-TE] to signal\
    \ the SCID\n   spaces between the ingress and egress routers, and the HC algorithm\n\
    \   used to determine the context; these HC packets then contain the SCID\n  \
    \ identified by using the RSVP-TE objects.  It is also desirable to\n   signal\
    \ HC over MPLS tunnels with the Label Distribution Protocol\n   [LDP], since many\
    \ RFC 2547 VPN [MPLS-VPN] implementations use LDP as\n   the underlying LSP signaling\
    \ mechanism, and LDP is very scalable.\n   However, extensions to LDP may be needed\
    \ to signal SCIDs between\n   ingress and egress routers on HC over MPLS LSPs.\
    \  For example,\n   'targeted LDP sessions' might be established for signaling\
    \ SCIDs, or\n   perhaps methods described in [LDP-PWE3] to signal pseudo-wires\
    \ and\n   multipoint-to-point LSPs might be extended to support signaling of\n\
    \   SCIDs for HC over MPLS LSPs.  The specific MPLS signaling protocol\n   extensions\
    \ to support these approved requirements need to be\n   developed as a well-coordinated\
    \ separate document in the appropriate\n   IETF working groups.  The IETF needs\
    \ to support a coordinated process\n   for the two solution documents, though\
    \ they are in separate areas.\n"
