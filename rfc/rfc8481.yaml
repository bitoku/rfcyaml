  - "Abstract\n   Deployment of BGP origin validation based on Resource Public Key\n
    \  Infrastructure (RPKI) is hampered by, among other things, vendor\n   misimplementations
    in two critical areas: which routes are validated\n   and whether policy is applied
    when not specified by configuration.\n   This document is meant to clarify possible
    misunderstandings causing\n   those misimplementations; it thus updates RFC 6811
    by clarifying that\n   all prefixes should have their validation state set and
    that policy\n   must not be applied without operator configuration.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Deployment of RPKI-based BGP origin validation is hampered
    by, among\n   other things, vendor misimplementations in two critical areas: which\n
    \  routes are validated and whether policy is applied when not specified\n   by
    configuration.  This document is meant to clarify possible\n   misunderstandings
    causing those misimplementations.\n   When a route is distributed into BGP, the
    origin validation state is\n   set to NotFound, Valid, or Invalid per [RFC6811].
    \ Operational\n   testing has shown that the specifications of that RFC were not\n
    \  sufficient to avoid divergent implementations.  This document\n   attempts
    to clarify two areas which seem to cause confusion.\n   The implementation issues
    seem not to be about how to validate, i.e.,\n   how to decide if a route is NotFound,
    Valid, or Invalid.  The issues\n   seem to be which routes should be evaluated
    and have their evaluation\n   state set, and whether to apply policy without operator\n
    \  configuration.\n"

  - "3.  Suggested Reading\n   It is assumed that the reader understands BGP [RFC4271],
    the RPKI\n   [RFC6480], Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) [RFC6482], and\n   RPKI-based
    Prefix Validation [RFC6811].\n"

  - "4.  Evaluate ALL Prefixes\n   Significant Clarification: A router MUST evaluate
    and set the\n   validation state of all routes in BGP coming from any source (e.g.,\n
    \  eBGP, iBGP, or redistribution from static or connected routes),\n   unless
    specifically configured otherwise by the operator.  Otherwise,\n   the operator
    does not have the ability to drop Invalid routes coming\n   from every potential
    source and is therefore liable to complaints\n   from neighbors about propagation
    of Invalid routes.  For this reason,\n   [RFC6811] says:\n      When a BGP speaker
    receives an UPDATE from a neighbor, it SHOULD\n      perform a lookup as described
    above for each of the Routes in the\n      UPDATE message.  The lookup SHOULD
    also be applied to routes that\n      are redistributed into BGP from another
    source, such as another\n      protocol or a locally defined static route.\n   [RFC6811]
    goes on to say, \"An implementation MAY provide\n   configuration options to control
    which routes the lookup is applied\n   to.\"\n   When redistributing into BGP
    from any source (e.g., IGP, iBGP, or\n   from static or connected routes), there
    is no AS_PATH in the input to\n   allow RPKI validation of the originating Autonomous
    System (AS).  In\n   such cases, the router MUST use the AS of the router's BGP\n
    \  configuration.  If that is ambiguous because of confederation, AS\n   migration,
    or other multi-AS configuration, then the router\n   configuration MUST provide
    a means of specifying the AS to be used on\n   the redistribution, either per
    redistribution or globally.\n"

  - "5.  Set State, Don't Act\n   Significant Clarification: Once routes are evaluated
    and have their\n   state set, the operator should be in complete control of any
    policy\n   applied based on the evaluation state.  Absent specific operator\n
    \  configuration, policy MUST NOT be applied.\n   Automatic origin validation
    policy actions such as those described in\n   \"BGP Prefix Origin Validation State
    Extended Community\" [RFC8097]\n   MUST NOT be carried out or otherwise applied
    unless specifically\n   configured by the operator.\n"
