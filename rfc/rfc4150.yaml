    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"

  - "2.  Overview\n   This document continues the architecture created in the RMON2-MIB\n
    \  [RFC2021] by providing a major feature upgrade, primarily by\n   providing
    new metrics and studies to assist in the analysis of\n   performance for sub-application
    transaction flows in the network, in\n   direct relationship to the transport
    of application layer protocols.\n   Performance-monitoring agents have been widely
    used to analyze the\n   parameters and metrics related to the perceived performance
    of\n   distributed applications and services in networks.  The metrics\n   collected
    by these agents have ranged from basic response time to a\n   combination of metrics
    related to the loss and re-transmission of\n   datagrams and PDUs.  Although the
    metrics are becoming more useful in\n   the implementation of service-level monitoring
    and troubleshooting\n   tools, the lack of a standard method to report these has
    limited the\n   deployment to very specific customer needs and areas.\n   This
    document is intended to create a general framework for the\n   collection and
    reporting of performance-related metrics on sub-\n   application level transaction
    flows in a network.  The MIB in this\n   document is directly linked to the current
    RMON2-MIB [RFC2021], and\n   uses the Protocol Directory as a key component in
    reporting the\n   layering involved in the sub-application level transaction flows.\n
    \  The specific objectives of this document are to:\n      + Provide a drill-down
    capability to complement the user-perceived\n        monitoring defined within
    the Application Performance\n        Measurement MIB (APM-MIB) [RFC3729].  This
    capability is\n        intended to support trouble resolution, further characterization\n
    \       of performance, and a finer granularity of monitoring\n        capabilities.
    \ The APM-MIB provides a method for retrieving\n        aggregated measurement
    data of the end-user's perception of\n        application-level performance.  APM
    additionally provides\n        thresholding and associated alarms if the end-user
    perceived\n        performance degrades below defined thresholds.  The Transport\n
    \       Performance Metrics MIB (TPM-MIB) complements the APM-MIB\n        capabilities
    by monitoring sub-application level transaction\n        aspects not typically
    perceived by the end-user.  As an example,\n        APM-MIB provides response
    time statistics of a typical web-\n        browser application.  This application
    typically consists of DNS\n        transactions, TCP connection establishment
    (or multiple\n        establishments), HTTP download of the base page, and multiple\n
    \       downloads of the various embedded objects.  Ideally, TPM-MIB\n        would
    provide statistics on the performance aspects of these\n        multiple sub-application
    level transactions.\n      + Provide additional performance metrics and related
    statistics.\n        For troubleshooting and a finer granularity of performance\n
    \       monitoring, it is useful to provide measurements of additional\n        metrics
    beyond those supported by the APM-MIB.\n      + Support standards-based metrics
    and associated statistical\n        aggregation by defining methods to reference
    those standards.\n        The TPM-MIB provides a capability to describe metrics
    by\n        reference to appropriate IETF, ITU, or other standards bodies\n        defining
    metrics, including enterprise-specific standards\n        bodies.  This capability
    is provided through the\n        tpmMetricsDefTable.\n        Specifically, this
    MIB itself does not make references to metric\n        specifications of the IETF,
    ITU and other organizations.\n        Instead, it allows for the setup of the
    tpmMetricDefTable that\n        does reference such IETF, ITU, and other metric
    specifications,\n        and it allows pointers to such specifications to be dynamically\n
    \       listed in this table.  The following objects allow for that, and\n        the
    DESCRIPTION clauses (of the objects below) explain how this\n        is done:\n
    \              tpmMetricDefName OBJECT-TYPE\n               tpmMetricDefReference
    OBJECT-TYPE\n               tpmMetricDefGlobalID OBJECT-TYPE\n        The tpmMetricDefGlobalID
    object contains a reference to the\n        Object ID in a metrics registration
    MIB being developed in the\n        IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Working Group
    at the IETF; e.g.,\n        the IPPM-REGISTRY-MIB [RFC4148], which defines the
    metric.  For\n        metrics defined within the IPPM Working Group, which are\n
    \       included in the IPPM-REGISTRY-MIB, this object is used to\n        reference
    those metrics directly.  For metrics not included\n        within the IPPM-REGISTRY-MIB,
    the value of this object is set\n        to 0.0 for none.\n        Examples of
    appropriate references include the ITU-T\n        Recommendation Y.1540 [Y.1540]
    on IP packet transfer performance\n        metrics, and the IETF documents from
    the IPPM WG; e.g., RFC 2681\n        on the round trip delay metric [RFC2681]
    or RFC3393 on the delay\n        variation metric [RFC3393].  Others include RFC
    2679 [RFC2679],\n        RFC2680 [RFC2680], and RFC3432 [RFC3432].  Although no
    specific\n        metric is mandatory, implementations should, at a minimum,\n
    \       support a round-trip delay and a round-trip loss metric.\n      + Provide
    (as an option) a table storing the measurements of the\n        metrics on a transaction
    by transaction basis.  There are times\n        when it is useful to have access
    to the raw measurements.  The\n        tpmCurReportTable optionally provides access
    to this capability.\n   Although this document outlines the basic measurements
    of performance\n   in regard to the transport of application flows, it does not
    attempt\n   to measure or provide a means to measure the actual perceived\n   performance
    of the application transactions or quality.  The detailed\n   measurements of
    end-user-perceived performance are directly related\n   to this document and may
    be found in the APM-MIB [RFC3729].\n   The objects defined in this document are
    intended as an interface\n   between an RMON agent and an RMON management application
    and are not\n   intended for direct manipulation by humans.  Although some users
    may\n   tolerate the direct display of some of these objects, few will\n   tolerate
    the complexity of manually manipulating objects to\n   accomplish row creation.
    \ These functions should be handled by the\n   management application.\n"

  - "3.  Statistics Perspective\n   When dealing with time-based measurements on application
    data\n   packets, ideally all the timestamps and related data could be stored\n
    \  and forwarded for later analysis.  However, when faced with thousands\n   of
    conversations per second on ever-faster networks, storing all the\n   data, even
    if compressed, would take too much processing, memory, and\n   manager download
    time to be practical.\n   It is important to note that in dealing with network
    data we will be\n   dealing with statistical populations and not samples.  Statistics\n
    \  books deal with both because the math is similar.  In collecting\n   agent
    data, a population (i.e., all the data) must be processed.\n   Because of the
    nature of application protocols, just sampling some of\n   the packets will not
    give good results.  Missing just one critical\n   packet, such as one that specified
    an ephemeral port on which data\n   will be transmitted or what application will
    be run, can cause much\n   valid data to be lost.\n   The time-based measurements
    the agent collects will come from\n   examining the entire group of data, i.e.,
    the population.  The\n   population will be finite.  The agent will seek only
    to provide\n   information that will describe the actual data.  Analysis of that\n
    \  data will be left to the management station.\n   The simplest form of representing
    a group of data is by frequency\n   distributions, i.e., buckets.  Statistics
    provides a great many ways\n   of analyzing this type of data, and there are some
    rules in creating\n   the buckets.  First, the range needs to be known.  Second,
    a bucket\n   size needs to be determined.  Fixed bucket sizes are best, although\n
    \  variable may be used if needed.  However, the statistics texts tend\n   only
    to refer to operations of fixed-size buckets.  This method of\n   describing data
    is expensive for an agent to implement.  First, the\n   agent must process a great
    amount of data at a time.  Storing the\n   data, determining the range, locating
    the buckets, and then filling\n   in the data after the fact takes a fair amount
    of storage and time.\n   Fixing the range and bucket sizes in the beginning can
    be\n   problematic, as the agent may have to adjust the values for each of\n   the
    applications it collects data on.  Such numbers can be in the\n   thousands.  Additional
    complexity arises in adding new protocols and\n   even in describing the buckets
    themselves to the management\n   application.  This is the approach taken in the
    APM-MIB.\n   A complimentary approach is to provide frequency distribution\n   statistics.
    \ They describe aggregation such as mean and standard\n   deviation that can be
    obtained by summation functions on the\n   individual data elements in a population.
    \ Analysis of the data\n   described by these functions has been thoroughly studied,
    and\n   interpretation of these values is available to anyone with an\n   introduction
    to statistics.  In fact, frequency distributions are\n   routinely analyzed to
    generate these varied numbers, which are then\n   used for further analysis.  Note
    that frequency distributions, by\n   their very nature, provide an exact characterization
    of the data.\n   Whereas buckets will introduce error factors that are not present\n
    \  with direct analysis by summation-type formulas.  Because the TPM-MIB\n   provides
    a drill-down capability to the APM MIB, it has to measure\n   and store much more
    information than the APM-MIB.  For this reason,\n   and in order to complement
    the APM-MIB, the TPM-MIB relies on\n   statistical descriptions rather than a
    bucket description of the\n   measurement data.\n   The agent will provide data
    that can be used to calculate the most\n   basic and useful statistical aggregates.
    \ The agent will not perform\n   the calculations and will not provide the statistical
    measurement\n   directly.  There are several reasons why this is not desired.
    \ The\n   first is that finding the final measurement can be expensive in terms\n
    \  of computation and representation.  There are divisions and square\n   roots,
    and the measurements are expressed as floating point values.\n   The second is
    that by providing the variables to the statistical\n   functions, those variables
    are scalable.  It is possible to combine\n   smaller intervals into larger ones.\n
    \  An example is the arithmetic mean or average.  This is the sum of the\n   data
    divided by the number of data elements.  The agent will provide\n   the sum of
    the x and the number of elements N.  The management\n   station can perform the
    division to obtain the average.  Given two\n   samples, they can be combined by
    adding the sum of the x's and by\n   adding the number of elements to get a combined
    sum and number of\n   elements.  The average formula then works just the same.
    \ Also, the\n   sum of the x and the number of element variables are used in\n
    \  calculating other statistical measurement values.\n"

    - "3.1.  Statistics Structure\n   The data statistical elements, datum, of the
      metric have been chosen\n   to maximize the amount of data available while minimizing
      the amount\n   of memory needed to store the statistic and minimizing the CPU\n
      \  processing requirement needed to generate the statistic.\n   The statistic
      data structure contains five unsigned integer datum.\n       N        count
      of the number of data points for the metric\n       S(X)     sum of all the

      SUM from i=1 to N { i*X sub i}\n   A performance metric is used to describe
      events over a time interval.\n   The measurement points can be processed immediately
      into the\n   statistic and do not have to be stored for later processing.  For\n
      \  example, to count the number of events in a time interval, it is\n   sufficient
      to increment a counter for each event.  It is not\n   necessary to cache all
      the events and then to count them at the end\n   of the interval.  The statistic
      is also designed to be easily\n   scalable in terms of combining adjacent intervals.
      \ For example, if\n   an agent created a specific statistic every 30 seconds

      \                period.\n   This structure gives a generic framework upon which
      the actual\n   performance statistics will be defined.  Each specific statistical\n
      \  definition must address the specific significance, if any, given to\n   each
      metric datum.  While a specific metric definition should try to\n   conform
      to the generic framework, it is acceptable for a metric datum\n   to not be
      used, and to have no meaning, for a specific metric.  In\n   such cases the

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This MIB relates to a system that provides a
    passive monitoring\n   capability of a broadcast subnet, a switched subnet, or
    point-to-\n   point subnets.  As such, it collects information relating to network\n
    \  layer addresses and traffic statistics relating to conversations and\n   to
    application-level activities.  These statistics could be deemed\n   sensitive
    in certain networking environments.\n   There are a number of management objects
    defined in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
    \ Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n
    \  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment
    without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.
    \ These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n
    \     + The tpmTransMetricDirConfig object describes and configures the\n        probe's
    support for a given performance metric in relation to a\n        specified transaction
    and application.  The agent creates\n        entries in this table for all metric
    and transaction\n        combinations that it can generate, and this object controls
    the\n        on/off switch for this capability.  If certain statistics for a\n
    \       supported transaction are deemed sensitive, then access to SET\n        operations
    on this object should be protected.\n      + The tpmAggrReportCntrlDataSource
    sets the interface on which the\n        network addresses and conversational
    and application-level\n        statistics will be collected.\n      + The tpmAggrReportCntrlAggrType
    object controls the level of data\n        aggregation implemented in the report
    tables.  For example, this\n        object could be set to allow client-level
    information to be\n        exposed.\n   In order to implement this MIB module,
    an agent must make certain\n   management information available about protocols
    and network\n   addresses used within a managed system, which may be considered\n
    \  sensitive in some network environments.  Therefore some of the\n   readable
    objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX-ACCESS\n   other than not-accessible)
    may be considered sensitive or vulnerable\n   in some network environments.  It
    is thus important to control even\n   GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects
    and possibly to even\n   encrypt the values of these objects when sending them
    over the\n   network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n
    \     + The tpmAggrReportTable contains the statistical studies which\n        the
    probe was configured to generate.  These tables contain the\n        historical,
    aggregated data providing information on the network\n        address and traffic
    statistics related to their conversations.\n      + The tpmCurReportTable contains
    information on current\n        transaction flows.  This table provides a view
    of the current\n        activity on a subnet or a client machine.\n   SNMP versions
    prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself
    is secure (for example by using IPSec),\n   even then, there is no control as
    to who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)
    the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider
    the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410],
    section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms
    (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions
    prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy
    SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n
    \  responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance
    of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only
    to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET
    (change/create/delete) them.\n"
