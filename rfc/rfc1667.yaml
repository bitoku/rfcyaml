  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is now in the\
    \ process of\n   designing the Next Generation Internet Protocol (IPng). IPng\
    \ is\n   expected to be a driving force in the future of commercial off-the-\n\
    \   shelf (COTS) networking technology. It will have a major impact on\n   what\
    \ future networking technologies are widely available, cost\n   effective, and\
    \ multi-vendor interoperable.  Applications that have\n   all of their network-layer\
    \ requirements met by the standard features\n   of IPng will be at a great advantage,\
    \ whereas those that don't will\n   have to rely on less-widely available and\
    \ more costly protocols that\n   may have limited interoperability with the ubiquitous\
    \ IPng-based COTS\n   products.\n   This paper is intended to serve as input to\
    \ the IPng design effort by\n   specifying the network-layer requirements of Defense\
    \ Modeling and\n   Simulation (M&S) applications. It is important that the M&S\
    \ community\n   make its unique requirements clear to IPng designers so that\n\
    \   mechanisms for meeting these requirements can be considered as\n   standard\
    \ features for IPng. The intention is to make IPng's benefits\n   of wide COTS\
    \ availability, multi-vendor interoperability, and cost-\n   effectiveness fully\
    \ available to the M&S community.\n"

  - "2.  Background: Overview of Distributed Interactive Simulation\n   The Defense\
    \ Modeling and Simulation community requires an integrated,\n   wide-area, wideband\
    \ internetwork to perform Distributed Interactive\n   Simulation (DIS) exercises\
    \ among remote, dissimilar simulation\n   devices located at worldwide sites.\
    \ The network topology used in\n   current M&S exercises is typically that of\
    \ a high-speed cross-country\n   and trans-oceanic backbone running between wideband\
    \ packet switches,\n   with tail circuits running from these packet switches to\
    \ various\n   nearby sites. At any given site involved in an exercise, there may\
    \ be\n   several internetworked local area networks on which numerous\n   simulation\
    \ entity hosts are running.  Some of these hosts may be\n   executing computer-generated\
    \ semi-automated forces, while others may\n   be manned simulators.  The entire\
    \ system must accommodate delays and\n   delay variance compatible with human\
    \ interaction times in order to\n   preserve an accurate order of events and provide\
    \ a realistic combat\n   simulation. While the sites themselves may be geographically\
    \ distant\n   from one another, the simulation entities running at different sites\n\
    \   may themselves be operating and interacting as though they are in\n   close\
    \ proximity to one another in the battlefield.  Our goal is that\n   all of this\
    \ can take place in a common network that supports all\n   Defense modeling and\
    \ simulation needs, and hopefully is also shared\n   with other Defense applications.\n\
    \   In a typical DIS exercise, distributed simulators exchange\n   information\
    \ over an internetwork in the form of standardized protocol\n   data units (PDUs).\
    \ The DIS protocols and PDU formats are currently\n   under development.  The\
    \ first generation has been standardized as\n   IEEE 1278.1 and used for small\
    \ exercises (around 100 hosts), and\n   development of a second generation is\
    \ underway.  The current\n   Communications Architecture for DIS specifies use\
    \ of Internet\n   protocols.\n   The amount, type, and sensitivity level of information\
    \ that must be\n   exchanged during a typical DIS exercise drives the communications\n\
    \   requirements for that exercise, and depends on the number and type of\n  \
    \ participating entities and the nature and level of interaction among\n   those\
    \ entities.  Future DIS exercises now in planning extend to\n   hundreds of sites\
    \ and tens of thousands of simulation platforms\n   worldwide. For example, an\
    \ exercise may consist of semi-automated and\n   individual manned tank, aircraft,\
    \ and surface ship simulators\n   interacting on pre-defined geographic terrain.\
    \ The actual locations\n   of these simulation entities may be distributed among\
    \ sites located\n   in Virginia, Kansas, Massachusetts, Germany, and Korea. The\
    \ PDUs that\n   are exchanged among simulation entities running at these sites\
    \ must\n   carry all of the information necessary to inform each site regarding\n\
    \   everything relevant that occurs with regard to all other sites that\n   have\
    \ the potential to affect it within the simulation. Such\n   information could\
    \ include the location of each entity, its direction\n   and speed, the orientation\
    \ of its weapons systems, if any, and the\n   frequency on which it is transmitting\
    \ and receiving radio messages.\n   If an entity launches a weapon, such as a\
    \ missile, a new entity\n   representing this missile will be created within the\
    \ simulation and\n   it will begin transmitting PDUs containing relevant information\
    \ about\n   its state, such as its location, and speed.\n   A typical moving entity\
    \ would generate between one and two PDUs per\n   second, with typical PDU sizes\
    \ of 220 bytes and a maximum size of\n   1400 bytes, although rates of 15 PDUs/second\
    \ and higher are possible.\n   Stationary entities must generate some traffic\
    \ to refresh receiving\n   simulators; under the current standard this can be\
    \ as little as 0.2\n   PDUs per second.  Compression techniques reducing PDUs\
    \ size by 50% or\n   more are being investigated but are not included in the current\
    \ DIS\n   standard.\n   With so much information being exchanged among simulation\
    \ entities at\n   numerous locations, multicasting is required to minimize network\n\
    \   bandwidth used and to reduce input to individual simulation entities\n   so\
    \ that each entity receives only those PDUs that are of interest to\n   it. For\
    \ example, a given entity need only receive information\n   regarding the location,\
    \ speed and direction of other entities that\n   are close enough to it within\
    \ the geography of the simulation that it\n   could be affected by those entities.\
    \  Similarly, an entity need not\n   receive PDUs containing the contents of radio\
    \ transmissions that are\n   sent on a frequency other than that on which the\
    \ entity is listening.\n   Resource reservation mechanisms are also essential\
    \ to guarantee\n   performance requirements of DIS exercises: reliability and\
    \ real-time\n   transmission are necessary to accommodate the manned simulators\n\
    \   participating in an exercise.\n   M&S exercises that include humans in the\
    \ loop and are executed in\n   real-time require rapid network response times\
    \ in order to provide\n   realistic combat simulations.  For DIS, latency requirements\
    \ between\n   the output of a PDU at the application level of a simulator and\
    \ input\n   of that PDU at the application level of any other simulator in that\n\
    \   exercise have been defined as:\n      - 100 milliseconds for exercises containing\
    \ simulated units\n        whose interactions are tightly coupled\n      - 300\
    \ milliseconds for exercises whose interactions are not\n        tightly coupled\
    \ [2].\n   The reliability of the best-effort datagram delivery service\n   supporting\
    \ DIS should be such that 98% of all datagrams are delivered\n   to all intended\
    \ destination sites, with missing datagrams randomly\n   distributed [3].\n  \
    \ While these numbers may be refined for some classes of simulation\n   data in\
    \ the future, latency requirements are expected to remain under\n   a few hundred\
    \ milliseconds in all cases.  It is also required that\n   delay variance (jitter)\
    \ be low enough that smoothing by buffering the\n   data stream at the receiving\
    \ simulator does not cause the stated\n   latency specifications to be exceeded.\n\
    \   There are currently several architectures under consideration for the\n  \
    \ M&S network of the future. Under fully distributed models, all\n   simulation\
    \ entities rely directly on the network protocols for\n   multicasting and are\
    \ therefore endowed with much flexibility with\n   regard to their ability to\
    \ join and leave multicast groups\n   dynamically, in large numbers.\n   In some\
    \ cases, the M&S exercises will involve the transmission of\n   classified data\
    \ over the network. For example, messages may contain\n   sensitive data regarding\
    \ warfare tactics and weapons systems\n   characteristics, or an exercise itself\
    \ may be a rehearsal of an\n   imminent military operation. This means the data\
    \ communications used\n   for these exercises must meet security constraints defined\
    \ by the\n   National Security Agency (NSA).  Some such requirements can be met\
    \ in\n   current systems by use of end-to-end packet encryption (E3) systems.\n\
    \   E3 systems provide adequate protection from disclosure and tampering,\n  \
    \ while allowing multiple security partitions to use the same network\n   simultaneously.\n\
    \   Currently the M&S community is using the experimental Internet Stream\n  \
    \ protocol version 2 (ST2) to provide resource reservation and\n   multicast.\
    \  There is much interest in converting to IPv4 multicast as\n   it becomes available\
    \ across the COTS base, but this cannot happen\n   until IPv4 has a resource reservation\
    \ capability.  The RSVP work\n   ongoing in the IETF is being watched in expectation\
    \ that it will\n   provide such a capability.  Also some tests have been made\
    \ of IPv4\n   multicast without resource reservation; results have been positive,\n\
    \   now larger tests are required to confirm the expected scalability of\n   IPv4\
    \ multicast.  But issues remain: for security reasons, some M&S\n   exercises\
    \ will require sender-initiated joining of members to\n   multicast groups. In\
    \ addition, it is not clear that IPv4 multicast\n   will be able to make use of\
    \ link-layer multicast available in ATM\n   systems, which the M&S community expects\
    \ to use to achieve the\n   performance necessary for large exercises.\n"
- title: 3.  M&S Requirements for IPng
  contents:
  - "3.  M&S Requirements for IPng\n   The identified network-layer service requirements\
    \ for M&S\n   applications are set forth below in three major categories: real-time\n\
    \   response, multicast capability, and resource reservation capability.\n   All\
    \ of these capabilities are considered to be absolute requirements\n   for supporting\
    \ DIS as currently understood by the M&S community,\n   except those specifically\
    \ identified as highly desirable.  By\n   desirable we mean that the capabilities\
    \ are not essential, but they\n   will enable more direct or cost-effective networking\
    \ solutions.\n   It is recognized that some of the capabilities described below\
    \ may be\n   provided not from IPng but from companion protocols, e.g. RSVP and\n\
    \   IGMP.  The M&S requirement is for a compatible suite of protocols\n   that\
    \ are available in commercial products.\n   a.  Real-time Response\n      DIS\
    \ will continue to have requirements to communicate real-time\n      data, therefore\
    \ the extent to which IPng lends itself to\n      implementing real-time networks\
    \ will be a measure of its utility\n      for M&S networking.  The system-level\
    \ specifications for the DIS\n      real-time environment are stated in Section\
    \ 2 above.\n   b.  Multicasting\n      M&S requires a multicasting capability\
    \ and a capability for\n      managing multicast group membership.  These multicasting\n\
    \      capabilities must meet the following requirements:\n      - Scalable to\
    \ hundreds of sites and, potentially, to tens of\n        thousands of simulation\
    \ platforms.\n      - It is highly desirable that the network-layer multicasting\n\
    \        protocol be able to use the multicasting capabilities of\n        link-level\
    \ technologies, such as broadcast LANs, Frame Relay,\n        and ATM.\n     \
    \ - The group management mechanics must have the characteristics\n        that\
    \ thousands of multicast groups consisting of tens of\n        thousands of members\
    \ each can be supported on a given network\n        and that a host should be\
    \ able to belong to hundreds of multicast\n        groups simultaneously.\n  \
    \    - Multicast group members must be able to be added to or removed\n      \
    \  from groups dynamically, in less than one second, at rates of\n        hundreds\
    \ of membership changes per second.  It is not possible\n        to predict what\
    \ special cases may develop, thus this requirement\n        is for all members\
    \ of all groups.\n      - The network layer must support options for both sender-\
    \ and\n        receiver-initiated joining of multicast groups.\n   c.  Resource\
    \ Reservation\n      The M&S community requires performance guarantees in supporting\n\
    \      networks. This implies that IPng must be compatible with a\n      capability\
    \ to reserve bandwidth and other necessary allocations in\n      a multicast environment,\
    \ in order to guarantee network capacity\n      from simulator-to-simulator across\
    \ a shared network for the\n      duration of the user's interaction with the\
    \ network. Such a\n      resource reservation capability is essential to optimizing\
    \ the use\n      of limited network resources, increasing reliability, and\n \
    \     decreasing delay and delay variance of priority traffic,\n      especially\
    \ in cases in which network resources are heavily used.\n      The resource reservations\
    \ should be accomplished in such a way\n      that traffic without performance\
    \ guarantees will be re-routed,\n      dropped, or blocked before reserved bandwidth\
    \ traffic is affected.\n      In addition, it would be highly desirable for the\
    \ resource\n      reservation capability to provide mechanisms for:\n      - Invoking\
    \ additional network resources (on-demand capacity)\n        when needed.\n  \
    \    - The network to feed back its loading status to the applications\n     \
    \   to enable graceful degradation of performance.\n"
