  contents:
  - "Charter for the IETF Discussion List\n   The IETF discussion list, ietf@ietf.org,\
    \ serves two purposes.  It\n   furthers the development and specification of Internet\
    \ technology\n   through discussion of technical issues.  It also hosts discussions\
    \ of\n   IETF direction, policy, meetings, and procedures.  As this is the\n \
    \  most general IETF mailing list, considerable latitude is allowed.\n   Advertising,\
    \ whether to solicit business or promote employment\n   opportunities, falls well\
    \ outside the range of acceptable topics, as\n   do discussions of a personal\
    \ nature.\n   This list is meant for initial discussion only.  Discussions that\n\
    \   fall within the area of any working group or well established list\n   should\
    \ be moved to such more specific forum as soon as this is\n   pointed out, unless\
    \ the issue is one for which the working group\n   needs wider input or direction.\n\
    \   In addition to the topics noted above, appropriate postings include:\n   \
    \ - Last Call discussions of proposed protocol actions\n    - Discussion of technical\
    \ issues that are candidates for IETF work,\n      but do not yet have an appropriate\
    \ e-mail venue\n    - Discussion of IETF administrative policies\n    - Questions\
    \ and clarifications concerning IETF meetings\n    - Announcements of conferences,\
    \ events, or activities that are\n      sponsored or endorsed by the Internet\
    \ Society or IETF.\n   Inappropriate postings include:\n    - Unsolicited bulk\
    \ e-mail\n    - Discussion of subjects unrelated to IETF policy, meetings,\n \
    \     activities, or technical concerns\n    - Unprofessional commentary, regardless\
    \ of the general subject\n    - Announcements of conferences, events, or activities\
    \ that are not\n      sponsored or endorsed by the Internet Society or IETF.\n\
    \   The IETF Chair, the IETF Executive Director, or a sergeant-at-arms\n   appointed\
    \ by the Chair is empowered to restrict posting by a person,\n   or of a thread,\
    \ when the content is inappropriate and represents a\n   pattern of abuse.  They\
    \ are encouraged to take into account the\n   overall nature of the postings by\
    \ an individual and whether\n   particular postings are an aberration or typical.\
    \  Complaints\n   regarding their decisions should be referred to the IAB.\n"
