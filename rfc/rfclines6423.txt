Abstract This document describes the requirements for using the Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL) in pseudowires (PWs) in MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS TP) networks, and provides an update to the description of GAL usage in RFC 5586 by removing the restriction that is imposed on using GAL for PWs, especially in MPLS TP environments.
Introduction [RFC5586] generalizes the Associated Channel mechanism of [RFC5085] to be used for Sections, Label Switched Paths (LSPs), and Pseudowires (PWs) in MPLS networks.
the Associated Channel Header (ACH), and [RFC5586] generalizes this for use as the Generic Associated Channel (G ACh).
[RFC5586] defines a generalized label based exception mechanism using the Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL) to work together with the ACH for use with LSPs but prohibits GAL usage with PWs.
This document removes the restriction imposed by [RFC5586].

GAL Usage for MPLS TP PW
According to the MPLS TP requirements document [RFC5654], it is necessary that MPLS TP mechanisms and capabilities be able to interoperate with the existing IETF MPLS [RFC3031] and IETF PWE3 [RFC3985] architectures as appropriate.
[RFC5586] differentiates between the usage of the GAL with PWs in MPLS and MPLS TP environments in Section 4.2 as follows:
In MPLS TP, the GAL MUST be used with packets on a G ACh on LSPs, Concatenated Segments of LSPs, and with Sections, and MUST NOT be used with PWs.
This indicates that the GAL can be used for MPLS TP LSPs and Sections, but not for PWs in an MPLS TP network.
However, there is no restriction imposed on the usage of the GAL in MPLS PWs, which is described immediately afterwards in the same section (Section 4.2) of [RFC5586]:
However, in other MPLS environments, this document places no restrictions on where the GAL may appear within the label stack or its use with PWs.
The inconsistency between the usage of the GAL with MPLS PWs and MPLS TP PWs may cause unnecessary implementation differences and is in disagreement with the MPLS TP requirements.
Therefore, this document specifies that the GAL can be used with packets on a G ACh on LSPs, Concatenated Segments of LSPs, Sections, and PWs in both MPLS and MPLS TP environments without discrimination.
[RFC5586] is updated by removing the restrictions on using GAL for PW as follows:  Section 1 (Introduction) in [RFC5586], the original text: The GAL mechanism is defined to work together with the ACH for LSPs and MPLS Sections.
is replaced by: The GAL mechanism is defined to work together with the ACH for LSPs and MPLS Sections, and for PWs.
(GAL Applicability and Usage) in [RFC5586], the original text: In MPLS TP, the GAL MUST be used with packets on a G ACh on LSPs, Concatenated Segments of LSPs, and with Sections, and MUST NOT be used with PWs.
It MUST always be at the bottom of the label stack (i.e., S bit set to 1).
However, in other MPLS environments, this document places no restrictions on where the GAL may appear within the label stack or its use with PWs.
In MPLS TP, the GAL MUST be used with packets on a G ACh on LSPs, Concatenated Segments of LSPs, and with Sections, and MAY be used with PWs.
The presence of a GAL indicates that an ACH immediately follows the MPLS label stack.
There are no further security considerations than those in [RFC5586].
