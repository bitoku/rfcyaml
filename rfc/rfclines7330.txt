Abstract This document defines two Management Information Base (MIB) modules that contain Textual Conventions to represent commonly used Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) management information.
The intent is that these TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs) will be imported and used in BFD related MIB modules that would otherwise define their own representations.
This document defines two MIB modules that contain Textual Conventions for Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocols.
These Textual Conventions should be imported by MIB modules that manage BFD protocols.
Note that names of Textual Conventions defined in this document are prefixed with either "Bfd" or "IANA" to make it obvious to readers that some are specific to BFD modules, whereas others are IANA maintained.
For an introduction to the concepts of BFD, see [RFC5880], [RFC5881], [RFC5883], [RFC6428], and [RFC7130].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
BFD Textual Conventions MIB Definitions
This MIB module makes references to the following documents: [RFC2578], [RFC2579], [RFC5880], [RFC5881], [RFC5883], [RFC6428], and [RFC7130].

3784 represents single hop BFD session.
4784 represents multi hop BFD session.
6784 represents BFD on Link Aggregation Group (LAG) session.
However, syntax is left open to wider range of values purposely for two reasons: 1.
Implementation uses non compliant port number for valid proprietary reason.
The value of 0 is a special, reserved value used to indicate special conditions and should not be considered a valid port number.

An IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC is always interpreted within the context of an IANAbfdSessAuthenticationTypeTC value.
Every usage of the IANAbfdSessAuthenticationTypeTC textual convention is required to specify the IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC object that provides the context.
It is suggested that the IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC object be logically registered before the object(s) that use the IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC textual convention, if they appear in the same logical row.
The value of an IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC must always be consistent with the value of the associated IANAbfdSessAuthenticationTypeTC object.
Attempts to set an IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC object to a value inconsistent with the associated IANAbfdSessAuthenticationTypeTC must fail with an inconsistentValue error.
The following size constraints for an IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC object are defined for the associated IANAbfdSessAuthenticationTypeTC values show below: noAuthentication( 1): SIZE(0) reserved(0)
When this textual convention is used as the syntax of an index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128 sub identifiers specified in SMIv2, STD 58.
In this case, the object definition MUST include a 'SIZE' clause to limit the number of potential instance sub identifiers; otherwise, the applicable constraints MUST be stated in the appropriate conceptual row DESCRIPTION clauses, or in the surrounding documentation if there is no single DESCRIPTION clause that is appropriate."

This module does not define any management objects.
Instead, it defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other BFD MIB modules to define management objects.
Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB modules that define management objects.
This document has therefore no impact on the security of the Internet.
This document provides the base definition of the IANA BFD TC STD MIB module.
This MIB module is under the direct control of IANA.
See Section 3 for the initial contents.

Assignments of IANA BFD TC STD MIB are via IETF Review [RFC5226].
This MIB makes reference to the following documents: [RFC2578], [RFC2579], [RFC5880], [RFC5881] and [RFC5883], [RFC6428], and [RFC7130].
IANA assigned an OID to the BFD TC STD MIB module specified in this document as { mib 2 223 }.
IANA assigned an OID to the IANA BFD TC STD MIB module specified in this document as { mib 2 224 }.
