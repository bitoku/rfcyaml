- title: 1.2.  Data Model
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Data Model\n   The data model for JSON responses is specified in five sections:\n\
    \   1.  simple data types conveyed in JSON strings\n   2.  data structures specified\
    \ as JSON arrays or objects that are used\n       repeatedly when building up\
    \ larger objects\n   3.  object classes representing structured data corresponding\
    \ to a\n       lookup of a single object\n   4.  arrays of objects representing\
    \ structured data corresponding to a\n       search for multiple objects\n   5.\
    \  the response to an error\n   The object classes represent responses for two\
    \ major categories of\n   data: responses returned by RIRs for registration data\
    \ related to IP\n   addresses, reverse DNS names, and Autonomous System numbers\
    \ and\n   responses returned by DNRs for registration data related to forward\n\
    \   DNS names.  The following object classes are returned by both RIRs\n   and\
    \ DNRs:\n   1.  domains\n   2.  nameservers\n   3.  entities\n   The information\
    \ served by both RIRs and DNRs for these object classes\n   overlap extensively\
    \ and are given in this document as a unified model\n   for both classes of service.\n\
    \   In addition to the object classes listed above, RIRs also serve the\n   following\
    \ object classes:\n   1.  IP networks\n   2.  Autonomous System numbers\n   Object\
    \ classes defined in this document represent a minimal set of\n   what a compliant\
    \ client/server needs to understand to function\n   correctly; however, some deployments\
    \ may want to include additional\n   object classes to suit individual needs.\
    \  Anticipating this need for\n   extension, Section 2.1 of this document defines\
    \ a mechanism for\n   extending the JSON objects that are described in this document.\n\
    \   Positive responses take two forms.  A response to a lookup of a\n   single\
    \ object in the registration system yields a JSON object, which\n   is the subject\
    \ of the lookup.  A response to a search for multiple\n   objects yields a JSON\
    \ object that contains an array of JSON objects\n   that are the subject of the\
    \ search.  In each type of response, other\n   data structures are present within\
    \ the topmost JSON object.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Naming
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Naming\n   Clients of these JSON responses SHOULD ignore unrecognized JSON\n\
    \   members in responses.  Servers can insert members into the JSON\n   responses,\
    \ which are not specified in this document, but that does\n   not constitute an\
    \ error in the response.  Servers that insert such\n   unspecified members into\
    \ JSON responses SHOULD have member names\n   prefixed with a short identifier\
    \ followed by an underscore followed\n   by a meaningful name.  It has been observed\
    \ that these short\n   identifiers aid software implementers with identifying\
    \ the\n   specification of the JSON member, and failure to use one could cause\n\
    \   an implementer to assume the server is erroneously using a name from\n   this\
    \ specification.  This allowance does not apply to jCard [RFC7095]\n   objects.\
    \  The full JSON name (the prefix plus the underscore plus the\n   meaningful\
    \ name) SHOULD adhere to the character and name limitations\n   of the prefix\
    \ registry described in [RFC7480].  Failure to use these\n   limitations could\
    \ result in slower adoption as these limitations have\n   been observed to aid\
    \ some client programming models.\n   Consider the following JSON response with\
    \ JSON members, all of which\n   are specified in this document.\n   {\n     \"\
    handle\" : \"ABC123\",\n     \"remarks\" :\n     [\n       {\n         \"description\"\
    \ :\n         [\n           \"She sells sea shells down by the sea shore.\",\n\
    \           \"Originally written by Terry Sullivan.\"\n         ]\n       }\n\
    \     ]\n   }\n                                 Figure 1\n   If The Registry of\
    \ the Moon desires to express information not found\n   in this specification,\
    \ it might select \"lunarNic\" as its identifying\n   prefix and insert, as an\
    \ example, the member named\n   \"lunarNic_beforeOneSmallStep\" to signify registrations\
    \ occurring\n   before the first moon landing and the member named\n   \"lunarNic_harshMistressNotes\"\
    \ that contains other descriptive text.\n   Consider the following JSON response\
    \ with JSON names, some of which\n   should be ignored by clients without knowledge\
    \ of their meaning.\n   {\n     \"handle\" : \"ABC123\",\n     \"lunarNic_beforeOneSmallStep\"\
    \ : \"TRUE THAT!\",\n     \"remarks\" :\n     [\n       {\n         \"description\"\
    \ :\n         [\n           \"She sells sea shells down by the sea shore.\",\n\
    \           \"Originally written by Terry Sullivan.\"\n         ]\n       }\n\
    \     ],\n     \"lunarNic_harshMistressNotes\" :\n     [\n       \"In space,\"\
    ,\n       \"nobody can hear you scream.\"\n     ]\n   }\n                    \
    \             Figure 2\n   Insertion of unrecognized members ignored by clients\
    \ may also be used\n   for future revisions to this specification.\n   Clients\
    \ processing JSON responses need to be prepared for members\n   representing registration\
    \ data specified in this document to be\n   absent from a response.  In other\
    \ words, servers are free to not\n   include JSON members containing registration\
    \ data based on their own\n   policies.\n   Finally, all JSON names specified\
    \ in this document are case\n   sensitive.  Both servers and clients MUST transmit\
    \ and process them\n   using the specified character case.\n"

    \   whereas the remarks structure denotes information about the object\n   class\
    \ that contains it (see Section 5 regarding object classes).\n   Both are arrays\
    \ of objects.  Each object contains an optional \"title\"\n   string representing\
    \ the title of the object, an optional \"type\"\n   string denoting a registered\

- title: 5.  Object Classes
  contents:
  - "5.  Object Classes\n   Object classes represent structures appropriate for a\
    \ response from\n   the queries specified in [RFC7482].\n   Each object class\
    \ contains a \"links\" array as specified in\n   Section 4.2.  For every object\
    \ class instance in a response, whether\n   the object class instance is directly\
    \ representing the response to a\n   query or is embedded in other object class\
    \ instances or is an item in\n   a search result set, servers SHOULD provide a\
    \ link representing a URI\n   for that object class instance using the \"self\"\
    \ relationship as\n   described in the IANA registry specified by [RFC5988]. \
    \ As explained\n   in Section 5.2, this may be not always be possible for nameserver\n\
    \   data.  Clients MUST be able to process object instances without a\n   self\
    \ link.  When present, clients can use the self link for caching\n   data.  Servers\
    \ MAY provide more than one self link for any given\n   object instance.  Failure\
    \ to provide any self link by a server may\n   result in clients being unable\
    \ to cache object class instances.\n   Clients using self links for caching SHOULD\
    \ not cache any object\n   class instances where the authority of the self link\
    \ is different\n   than the authority of the server returning the data.  Failing\
    \ to do\n   so might result in cache poisoning.\n   Self links MUST contain a\
    \ \"type\" element containing the \"application/\n   rdap+json\" media type when\
    \ referencing RDAP object instances as\n   defined by this document.\n   This\
    \ is an example of the \"links\" array with a self link to an object\n   class:\n\

  contents:
  - "5.1.  The Entity Object Class\n   The entity object class appears throughout\
    \ this document and is an\n   appropriate response for the /entity/XXXX query\
    \ defined in\n   \"Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) Query Format\" [RFC7482].\n\
    \   This object class represents the information of organizations,\n   corporations,\
    \ governments, non-profits, clubs, individual persons,\n   and informal groups\
    \ of people.  All of these representations are so\n   similar that it is best\
    \ to represent them in JSON [RFC7159] with one\n   construct, the entity object\
    \ class, to aid in the reuse of code by\n   implementers.\n   The entity object\
    \ class uses jCard [RFC7095] to represent contact\n   information, such as postal\
    \ addresses, email addresses, phone numbers\n   and names of organizations and\
    \ individuals.  Many of the types of\n   information that can be represented with\
    \ jCard have no use in RDAP,\n   such as birthdays, anniversaries, and gender.\n\
    \   The entity object is served by both RIRs and DNRs.  The following is\n   an\

  - "5.4.  The IP Network Object Class\n   The IP network object class models IP network\

    \   the IP network (e.g., registrant information, contacts, etc.).\n   The following\

    \ -- denotes a type of notice or remark.\n       *  \"status\" -- denotes a value\
    \ for the \"status\" object member as\n          defined by Section 4.6.\n   \
    \    *  \"role\" -- denotes a value for the \"role\" array as defined in\n   \
    \       Section 5.1.\n       *  \"event action\" -- denotes a value for an event\
    \ action as\n          defined in Section 4.5.\n       *  \"domain variant relation\"\
    \ -- denotes a relationship between a\n          domain and a domain variant as\
    \ defined in Section 5.3.\n   3.  Description -- a one- or two-sentence description\
    \ regarding the\n       meaning of the value, how it might be used, and/or how\
    \ it should\n       be interpreted by clients.\n   4.  Registrant Name -- the\
    \ name of the person registering the value.\n   5.  Registrant Contact Information\
    \ -- an email address, postal\n       address, or some other information to be\
    \ used to contact the\n       registrant.\n   This registry is operated under\
    \ the \"Expert Review\" policy defined in\n   [RFC5226].\n   Review of registrations\
    \ into this registry by the designated\n   expert(s) should be narrowly judged\
    \ on the following criteria:\n   1.  Values in need of being placed into multiple\
    \ types must be\n       assigned a separate registration for each type.\n   2.\
    \  Values must be strings.  They should be multiple words separated\n       by\
    \ single space characters.  Every character should be\n       lowercased.  If\
    \ possible, every word should be given in English\n       and each character should\
    \ be US-ASCII.\n   3.  Registrations should not duplicate the meaning of any existing\n\
    \       registration.  That is, if a request for a registration is\n       significantly\
    \ similar in nature to an existing registration, the\n       request should be\
    \ denied.  For example, the terms \"maintainer\"\n       and \"registrant\" are\
    \ significantly similar in nature as they both\n       denote a holder of a domain\
    \ name or Internet number resource.  In\n       cases where it may be reasonably\
    \ argued that machine\n       interpretation of two similar values may alter the\
    \ operation of\n       client software, designated experts should not judge the\
    \ values\n       to be of significant similarity.\n   4.  Registrations should\
    \ be relevant to the common usages of RDAP.\n       Designated experts may rely\
    \ upon the serving of the value by a\n       DNR or RIR to make this determination.\n\
    \   The following sections provide initial registrations into this\n   registry.\n"

- title: Appendix B.  Modeling Events
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.  Modeling Events\n   Events represent actions that have taken place\
    \ against a registered\n   object at a certain date and time.  Events have three\
    \ properties: the\n   action, the actor, and the date and time of the event (which\
    \ is\n   sometimes in the future).  In some cases, the identity of the actor\n\
    \   is not captured.\n   Events can be modeled in three ways:\n   1.  events with\
    \ no designated actor\n   2.  events where the actor is only designated by an\
    \ identifier\n   3.  events where the actor can be modeled as an entity\n   For\
    \ the first use case, the events data structure (Section 4.5) is\n   used without\
    \ the \"eventActor\" object member.\n   This is an example of an \"events\" array\
    \ without the \"eventActor\".\n   \"events\" :\n   [\n     {\n       \"eventAction\"\

    \ the events data structure (Section 4.5) is\n   used with the \"eventActor\"\
    \ object member.\n   This is an example of an \"events\" array with the \"eventActor\"\
    .\n   \"events\" :\n   [\n     {\n       \"eventAction\" : \"registration\",\n\

    \ case, the \"asEventActor\" array is used when an\n   entity (Section 5.1) is\
    \ embedded into another object class.  The\n   \"asEventActor\" array follows\
    \ the same structure as the \"events\" array\n   but does not have \"eventActor\"\

  - "Appendix C.  Structured vs. Unstructured Addresses\n   The entity (Section 5.1)\
    \ object class uses jCard [RFC7095] to\n   represent contact information, including\
    \ postal addresses. jCard has\n   the ability to represent multiple language preferences,\
    \ multiple\n   email address and phone numbers, and multiple postal addresses\
    \ in\n   both a structured and unstructured format.  This section describes\n\
    \   the use of jCard for representing structured and unstructured\n   addresses.\n\
    \   The following is an example of a jCard.\n   {\n     \"vcardArray\":[\n   \

    \ arrays in Figure 40 with the first member of \"adr\" represent\n   postal addresses.\
    \  In the first example, the postal address is given\n   as an array of strings\
    \ and constitutes a structured address.  For\n   components of the structured\
    \ address that are not applicable, an\n   empty string is given.  Each member\
    \ of that array aligns with the\n   positions of a vCard as given in [RFC6350].\
    \  In this example, the\n   following data corresponds to the following positional\
    \ meanings:\n   1.  post office box -- not applicable; empty string\n   2.  extended\
    \ address (e.g., apartment or suite number) -- Suite 1234\n   3.  street address\
    \ -- 4321 Rue Somewhere\n   4.  locality (e.g., city) -- Quebec\n   5.  region\
    \ (e.g., state or province) -- QC\n   6.  postal code -- G1V 2M2\n   7.  country\
    \ name (full name) -- Canada\n   The second example is an unstructured address.\
    \  It uses the label\n   attribute, which is a string containing a newline (\\\
    n) character to\n   separate address components in an unordered, unspecified manner.\n\
    \   Note that in this example, the structured address array is still\n   given\
    \ but that each string is an empty string.\n"
- title: Appendix D.  Secure DNS
  contents:
  - "Appendix D.  Secure DNS\n   Section 5.3 defines the \"secureDNS\" member to represent\
    \ secure DNS\n   information about domain names.\n   DNSSEC provides data integrity\
    \ for DNS through the digital signing of\n   resource records.  To enable DNSSEC,\
    \ the zone is signed by one or\n   more private keys and the signatures are stored\
    \ as RRSIG records.  To\n   complete the chain of trust in the DNS zone hierarchy,\
    \ a digest of\n   each DNSKEY record (which contains the public key) must be loaded\n\
    \   into the parent zone, stored as DS records, and signed by the\n   parent's\
    \ private key (RRSIG DS record), as indicated in \"Resource\n   Records for the\
    \ DNS Security Extensions\" [RFC4034].  Creating the DS\n   records in the parent\
    \ zone can be done by the registration authority\n   \"Domain Name System (DNS)\
    \ Security Extensions Mapping for the\n   Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)\"\
    \ [RFC5910].\n   Only DS-related information is provided by RDAP, since other\n\
    \   information is not generally stored in the registration database.\n   Other\
    \ DNSSEC-related information can be retrieved with other DNS\n   tools such as\
    \ dig.\n   The domain object class (Section 5.3) can represent this information\n\
    \   using either the \"dsData\" or \"keyData\" object arrays.  Client\n   implementers\
    \ should be aware that some registries do not collect or\n   do not publish all\
    \ of the secure DNS meta-information.\n"
- title: Appendix E.  Motivations for Using JSON
  contents:
  - "Appendix E.  Motivations for Using JSON\n   This section addresses a common question\
    \ regarding the use of JSON\n   over other data formats, most notably XML.\n \
    \  It is often pointed out that many DNRs and one RIR support the EPP\n   [RFC5730]\
    \ standard, which is an XML serialized protocol.  The logic\n   is that since\
    \ EPP is a common protocol in the industry, it follows\n   that XML would be a\
    \ more natural choice.  While EPP does influence\n   this specification quite\
    \ a bit, EPP serves a different purpose, which\n   is the provisioning of Internet\
    \ resources between registries and\n   accredited registrars and serving a much\
    \ narrower audience than that\n   envisioned for RDAP.\n   By contrast, RDAP has\
    \ a broader audience and is designed for public\n   consumption of data.  Experience\
    \ from RIRs with first generation\n   RESTful web services for WHOIS indicate\
    \ that a large percentage of\n   clients operate within browsers and other platforms\
    \ where full-blown\n   XML stacks are not readily available and where JSON is\
    \ a better fit.\n   Additionally, while EPP is used in much of the DNR community\
    \ it is\n   not a universal constant in that industry.  And finally, EPP's use\
    \ of\n   XML predates the specification of JSON.  If EPP had been defined\n  \
    \ today, it may very well have used JSON instead of XML.\n   Beyond the specific\
    \ DNR and RIR communities, the trend in the broader\n   Internet industry is also\
    \ switching to JSON over XML, especially in\n   the area of RESTful web services\
    \ (see [JSON_ascendancy]).  Studies\n   have also found that JSON is generally\
    \ less bulky and consequently\n   faster to parse (see [JSON_performance_study]).\n"
