- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IAB, on behalf of the Internet technical community,\
    \ is concerned\n   with ensuring the continuity of the RFC Series, orderly RFC\
    \ Editor\n   succession, RFC quality, and RFC document accessibility.  The IAB\
    \ is\n   also sensitive to the concerns of the IETF Administrative Oversight\n\
    \   Committee (IAOC) about providing the necessary services in a cost-\n   effective\
    \ and efficient manner.\n   The contemporary RFC Editor model [RFC5620] was first\
    \ approved in\n   October 2008, and our understanding of the model has evolved\
    \ with our\n   experience since.  During the implementation of version 1 of the\n\
    \   model [RFC5620], it was quickly realized that the role of the RFC\n   Series\
    \ Editor (RSE) and the oversight responsibilities needed to be\n   structured\
    \ differently.  In order to gain experience with \"running\n   code\", a transitional\
    \ RSE was hired who analyzed the managerial\n   environment and provided recommendations.\
    \  This was followed by the\n   appointment of an acting RSE, who ably managed\
    \ the series while work\n   was undertaken to select and hire a permanent RSE.\
    \  This version of\n   the model is based on the recommendations of both temporary\
    \ RFC\n   Series Editors and the extensive discussion in the IETF community, on\n\
    \   the rfc-interest list, and within the IAB.  As such, this document\n   obsoletes\
    \ [RFC5620].\n   This document, and the resulting structures, will be modified\
    \ as\n   needed through normal procedures.  The RSE, and the IAB, through the\n\
    \   RFC Oversight Committee (see Section 3.1), will continue to monitor\n   discussions\
    \ within the community about potential adjustments to the\n   RFC Editor model\
    \ and recognize that the process described in this\n   document may need to be\
    \ adjusted to align with any changes that\n   result from such discussions; hence,\
    \ the version number in the title.\n   The IAB and IAOC maintain their chartered\
    \ responsibility as defined\n   in [RFC2850] and [RFC4071].\n"
- title: 1.1.  The RFC Editor Function
  contents:
  - "1.1.  The RFC Editor Function\n   The RFC Series is described in [RFC4844]. \
    \ Its Section 3.1 defines\n   \"RFC Editor\":\n      Originally, there was a single\
    \ person acting as editor of the RFC\n      Series (the RFC Editor).  The task\
    \ has grown, and the work now\n      requires the organized activity of several\
    \ experts, so there are\n      RFC Editors, or an RFC Editor organization.  In\
    \ time, there may be\n      multiple organizations working together to undertake\
    \ the work\n      required by the RFC Series.  For simplicity's sake, and without\n\
    \      attempting to predict how the role might be subdivided among them,\n  \
    \    this document refers to this collection of experts and\n      organizations\
    \ as the \"RFC Editor\".\n      The RFC Editor is an expert technical editor and\
    \ series editor,\n      acting to support the mission of the RFC Series.  As such,\
    \ the RFC\n      Editor is the implementer handling the editorial management of\
    \ the\n      RFC Series, in accordance with the defined processes.  In\n     \
    \ addition, the RFC Editor is expected to be the expert and prime\n      mover\
    \ in discussions about policies for editing, publishing, and\n      archiving\
    \ RFCs.\n   RFC 4844 does not explore the internal organization of the RFC\n \
    \  Editor.  However, RFC 4844 envisions changes in the RFC Editor\n   organizational\
    \ structure.  There have been several iterations on\n   efforts to improve and\
    \ clarify this structure.  These have been led\n   by the IAB, in consultation\
    \ with the community and many leadership\n   bodies within the community.  This\
    \ first resulted in the publication\n   of [RFC5620] and then in further discussions\
    \ leading to this\n   document.  Some of the details on this evolution can be\
    \ found below.\n   In undertaking this evolution, the IAB considered changes that\n\
    \   increase flexibility and operational support options, provide for the\n  \
    \ orderly succession of the RFC Editor, and ensure the continuity of\n   the RFC\
    \ Series, while maintaining RFC quality, maintaining timely\n   processing, ensuring\
    \ document accessibility, reducing costs, and\n   increasing cost transparency.\
    \  The model set forth below describes\n   the internal organization of the RFC\
    \ Editor, while remaining\n   consistent with RFC 4844.\n   Note that RFC 4844\
    \ uses the term \"RFC Editor function\" or \"RFC\n   Editor\" as the collective\
    \ set of responsibilities for which this memo\n   provides a model for internal\
    \ organization.  This memo defines the\n   term \"RFC Series Editor\" or \"Series\
    \ Editor\" for one of the\n   organizational components.\n"
- title: 2.  RFC Editor Model
  contents:
  - "2.  RFC Editor Model\n   The RFC Editor model divides the responsibilities for\
    \ the RFC Series\n   into the following components:\n   o  RFC Series Editor (RSE)\n\
    \   o  RFC Production Center\n   o  RFC Publisher\n   The structure and relationship\
    \ of the components of the RFC Series\n   production and process is schematically\
    \ represented by the figure\n   below.  The picture does not depict oversight\
    \ and escalation\n   relations.  It does include the streams and their managers\
    \ (which are\n   not part of the RFC Series Editor, the RFC Production Center,\

    \ the RSE is expected to develop a\n   relationship with the Internet technical\
    \ community.  The Editor is\n   expected to engage with the Internet technical\
    \ community in a process\n   of articulating and refining a vision for the series\
    \ and its\n   continuous evolution.  The RSE is also expected to engage other\
    \ users\n   of the RFC Series, in particular, the consumers of these documents,\n\
    \   such as those people who use them to specify products, write code,\n   test\
    \ behaviors, or other related activities.\n   Concretely:\n      The RSE is responsible\
    \ for the coordination of discussion on\n      series evolution among the series'\
    \ stream participants and the\n      broader Internet technical community.\n \
    \     In time, the RSE is expected to develop and refine a vision for\n      the\
    \ RFC Series, including examining:\n      *  The RFC Series, as it continues to\
    \ evolve.  The RSE is expected\n         to take a broad view and look for the\
    \ best ways to evolve the\n         series for the benefit of the entire Internet\
    \ community.  As\n         such, the RSE may even consider evolution beyond the\
    \ historical\n         'by engineers for engineers' emphasis; and\n      *  Its\
    \ publication-technical environment, by looking at whether it\n         should\
    \ be slowly changing in terms of publishing and archiving\n         techniques\
    \ -- particularly to better serve the communities that\n         produce and depend\
    \ on the RFC Series.  For example, all of\n         those communities have been\
    \ slowly changing to include a\n         significant population of multi-lingual\
    \ individuals or non-\n         native speakers of English.  Another example is\
    \ that some of\n         these constituencies also have shifted to include significant\n\
    \         groups whose primary focus is on the constraints and\n         consequences\
    \ of network engineering, rather than a primary\n         interest in the engineering\
    \ issues themselves.\n   For this type of responsibility, the RSE cooperates closely\

    \ ultimately, under oversight of the IAB.\n"

    \ oversight of the RFC Series and acts\n   as a body for final conflict resolution,\
    \ including the process\n   described in Section 4.3.\n   In order to provide\
    \ continuity over periods longer than the NomCom\n   appointment cycle [RFC3777]\
    \ and assure that oversight includes\n   suitable subject matter expertise, the\
    \ IAB will establish a group\n   that implements oversight for the IAB, the RFC\
    \ Series Oversight\n   Committee (RSOC).\n   The RSOC will act with authority\
    \ delegated from the IAB: in general,\n   it will be the RSOC that will approve\
    \ consensus policy and vision\n   documents as developed by the RSE in collaboration\
    \ with the\n   community.  While it is expected that the IAB will exercise due\n\
    \   diligence in its supervision of the RSOC, the RSOC should be allowed\n   the\
    \ latitude to do its job without undue interference from the IAB.\n   Therefore,\
    \ it is expected that the IAB will accord RSOC reports and\n   recommendations\
    \ the benefit of the doubt.\n   For all decisions that affect the RSE individually\
    \ (e.g., hiring and\n   firing), the RSOC prepares recommendations for the IAB,\
    \ but the final\n   decision is the responsibility of the IAB.  For instance the\
    \ RSOC\n   would do the following:\n   o  perform annual reviews of the RSE and\
    \ report the result of these\n      reviews to the IAB.\n   o  manage RSE candidate\
    \ selection and advise the IAB on candidate\n      appointment (in other words,\
    \ select the RSE subject to IAB\n      approval).\n   RSOC members are expected\
    \ to recognize potential conflicts of\n   interest and behave accordingly.\n \
    \  For the actual recruitment and selection of the RSE, the RSOC will\n   propose\
    \ a budget for the search process.  It will work with IASA to\n   refine that\
    \ budget and develop remuneration criteria and an\n   employment agreement or\

    \ The RSOC shall develop and publish its own rules of order.\n   The initial RSOC\
    \ was charged with designing and executing a\n   solicitation, search, and selection\
    \ process for the first actual (not\n   transitional or \"acting\") RSE appointment.\
    \  That process involved\n   iteration on this and related documents and evaluation\
    \ of various\n   strategies and options.  During the creation of this document,\
    \ it was\n   expected that the RSOC would describe the process it ultimately\n\
    \   selected to the community.  The RSOC did involve the community in\n   interim\
    \ considerations when that was likely to be of value.\n   Following completion\

    \ the final authority of the IAOC.\n   The RSE owns and develops the work definition\
    \ (the SOW) and\n   participates in the IASA vendor selection process.  The work\n\
    \   definition is created within the IASA budget and takes into account\n   the\
    \ stream managers and community input.\n   The process to select and contract\
    \ for an RFC Production Center, RFC\n   Publisher, and other RFC-related services,\
    \ is as follows:\n   o  The IAOC establishes the contract process, including the\
    \ steps\n      necessary to issue an RFP when necessary, the timing, and the\n\
    \      contracting procedures.\n   o  The IAOC establishes the Selection Committee,\
    \ which will consist\n      of the RSE, the IAD, and other members selected by\
    \ the RSOC and\n      the IAOC.  The Committee shall be chaired by the RSE.\n\
    \   o  The Selection Committee selects the vendor, subject to the\n      successful\
    \ negotiation of a contract approved by the IAOC.  In the\n      event that a\
    \ contract cannot be reached, the matter shall be\n      referred to the Selection\
    \ Committee for further action.\n   o  The Selection Committee may select an RFC\
    \ Publisher either through\n      the IASA RFP process or, at the Committee's\
    \ option, the Committee\n      may select the IETF Secretariat to provide RFC\
    \ Publisher services,\n      subject to negotiations in accordance with the IASA\
    \ procedures.\n"

  - "4.2.  Budget\n   The expenses discussed in this document are not new expenses.\
    \  They\n   have been and remain part of the IETF Administrative Support Activity\n\
    \   (IASA, [RFC4071]) budget.\n   The RFC Series portion of the IASA budget shall\
    \ include entries for\n   the RSOC, RSE, RFC Production Center, and the RFC Publisher.\
    \  The\n   IASA budget shall also include entries for the streams, including the\n\
    \   independent stream.\n   The IAOC has the responsibility to approve the total\
    \ RFC Editor\n   budget (and the authority to deny it).  The RSE must work within\
    \ the\n   IAOC budgetary process.\n   The RSE is responsible for managing the\
    \ RFC Editor function to\n   operate within those budgets.  If production needs\
    \ change, the RSE is\n   responsible for working with the Production Center, and\
    \ where\n   appropriate, other RFC Editor component institutions, relevant\n \
    \  streams, and/or the RSOC to determine what the correct response\n   should\
    \ be.  If they agree that a budgetary change is needed, that\n   decision needs\
    \ to be taken to the IAD and the IAOC.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Disagreements among Entities Related to the RFC Editor
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Disagreements among Entities Related to the RFC Editor\n   The RFC Series\
    \ Editor and the RFC Production Center and Publisher\n   facilities work with\
    \ the various streams to produce RFCs.\n   Disagreements may arise between these\
    \ entities during the execution\n   of the RFC Editor operations.  In particular,\
    \ different streams may\n   disagree with each other, or disagree with the RFC\
    \ Editor function.\n   Potentially, even the RSOC or the IAOC could find themselves\
    \ in\n   disagreement with some aspect of the RFC Editor operations.  Note\n \
    \  that disagreements between an author and the RFC Production Center\n   are\
    \ not cross-entity issues, and they are to be resolved by the RSE,\n   in accordance\
    \ with the rest of this document.\n   If such cross-entity disagreements arise,\
    \ the community would\n   generally hope that they can be resolved politely and\
    \ directly.\n   However, this is not always possible.  At that point, any relevant\n\
    \   party would first formally request a review and reconsideration of\n   the\
    \ decision.  If the party still disagrees after the\n   reconsideration, that\
    \ party may ask the RSE to decide or, especially\n   if the RSE is involved, the\
    \ party may ask the IAB Chair (for a\n   technical or procedural matter) to mediate\
    \ or appoint a mediator to\n   aid in the discussions, although he or she not\
    \ is obligated to do so.\n   All parties should work informally and in good faith\
    \ to reach a\n   mutually agreeable conclusion.  As noted below, any such issues\
    \ that\n   involve contractual matters must be brought to the attention of the\n\
    \   IAOC.  If the IAB Chair is asked to assist in resolving the matter,\n   the\
    \ Chair may ask for advice or seek assistance from anyone the Chair\n   deems\
    \ helpful.  The Chair may also alert any appropriate individuals\n   or organizations\
    \ to the existence of the issue.\n   If such a conclusion is not possible through\
    \ the above less formal\n   processes, then the matter must be registered with\
    \ the RFC Series\n   Oversight Committee.  The RSOC may choose to offer advice\
    \ to the RSE\n   or more general advice to the parties involved and may ask the\
    \ RSE to\n   defer a decision until it formulates its advice.  However, if a\n\
    \   timely decision cannot be reached through discussion, mediation, and\n   mutual\
    \ agreement, the RSE is expected to make whatever decisions are\n   needed to\
    \ ensure the smooth operation of the RFC Editor function;\n   those decisions\
    \ are final.\n   The RSE may make final decisions unilaterally only to assure\
    \ the\n   functioning of the process, and only while there is an evaluation of\n\
    \   current policies to determine whether they are appropriately\n   implemented\
    \ in the decision or need adjustment.  In particular, it\n   should be noted that\
    \ final decisions about the technical content of\n   individual documents are\
    \ the exclusive responsibility of the stream\n   approvers from which those documents\
    \ originate, as shown in the\n   illustration in Figure 1.\n   If informal agreements\
    \ cannot be reached, then formal RSOC review and\n   decision making may be required.\
    \  If so, the RSE must present the\n   issues involved to the community so that\
    \ the community is aware of\n   the situation.  The RSE will then report the issue\
    \ to the RSOC for\n   formal resolution by the RSOC with confirmation by the IAB\
    \ in its\n   oversight capacity.\n   IAB and community discussion of any patterns\
    \ of disputes are expected\n   to inform future changes to RFC Series policies,\
    \ including possible\n   updates to this document.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Issues with Contractual Impact
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Issues with Contractual Impact\n   If a disagreement or decision has immediate\
    \ or future contractual\n   consequences, it falls under BCP 101 [RFC4071] and\
    \ IASA; thus, the\n   RSE must identify the issue and provide his or her advice\
    \ to the\n   IAOC; additionally, if the RSOC has provided advice, forward that\n\
    \   advice as well.  The IAOC must notify the RSOC and IAB regarding the\n   action\
    \ it concludes is required to resolve the issue based on its\n   applicable procedures\
    \ and provisions in the relevant contracts.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   This document defines several functions within the\
    \ overall RFC Editor\n   structure, and it places the responsibility for coordination\
    \ of\n   registry value assignments with the RFC Production Center.  The IAOC\n\
    \   will facilitate the establishment of the relationship between the RFC\n  \
    \ Production Center and IANA.\n   This document does not create a new registry\
    \ nor does it register any\n   values in existing registries, and no IANA action\
    \ is required.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The same security considerations as those in\
    \ [RFC4844] apply.  The\n   processes for the publication of documents must prevent\
    \ the\n   introduction of unapproved changes.  Since the RFC Editor maintains\n\
    \   the index of publications, sufficient security must be in place to\n   prevent\
    \ these published documents from being changed by external\n   parties.  The archive\
    \ of RFC documents, any source documents needed\n   to recreate the RFC documents,\
    \ and any associated original documents\n   (such as lists of errata, tools, and,\
    \ for some early items, originals\n   that are not machine readable) need to be\
    \ secured against any kind of\n   data storage failure.\n   The IAOC should take\
    \ these security considerations into account\n   during the implementation and\
    \ enforcement of the RFC Editor component\n   contracts.\n"
