  - "                     The Remote User Telnet Service\nThis RFC is the specification\
    \ of an application protocol.  Any host that\nimplements this application level\
    \ service must follow this protocol.\nThis RFC was suggested by Mike Mulligan\
    \ some months ago when he was at\nBBN.\nIn the ARPANET Host-to-Host Network Control\
    \ Protocol (NCP) and in the\nInternet Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) well\
    \ known sockets or ports\nare used to identify services.  The general notion is\
    \ that there are a\nfew types of services that are distinct and useful enough\
    \ to use the NCP\nor TCP demultiplexing mechanism directly.\nThe most common of\
    \ these is the Server Telnet which generally speaking\ndefines the network terminal\
    \ access procedure for a system executive.\nThat is, making a connection to the\
    \ server Telnet port actually puts the\ncaller in contact with the system executive,\
    \ for example, the TOPS20\nEXEC or the Unix Shell.\nOn some small hosts there\
    \ may be very limited functionality and no\nexecutive.  In such cases it may be\
    \ useful to designate specific well\nknown ports for specific applications.\n\
    This memo specifies that the specific service of User Telnet may be\naccessed\
    \ (on hosts that choose to provide it) by opening a connection to\nport 107 (153\
    \ octal).  The Telnet Protocol is to be used on the\nconnection from the originating\
    \ user to the server.\nEXAMPLE: REMOTE TELNET SERVICE ON THE BBN TC68K\nThe TC68K\
    \ is a Terminal Concentrator based on the Motorola MC68000\nmicroprocessor.  It\
    \ is used at Bolt Beranek & Newman to provide access\nby terminals to the FiberNet,\
    \ a local area network.\nThe custom hardware provides one network connection,\
    \ sixteen RS232\nterminal connections, and a programmable timer.\nThe software\
    \ is based on the Micro-Operating System (MOS) using the IP,\nICMP, TCP, and Telnet\
    \ protocols.  A user TC-Telnet application provides\nan interface to allow the\
    \ user to use the network to connect to a host,\n                            \
    \                  Remote User Telnet Service\nproviding a network virtual terminal.\
    \  A server Telnet also exists on\nthe TC68K to serve as a front end for devices\
    \ that have no awareness of\nthe net.  This is used for remote printer/plotters\
    \ and computers with no\nnetwork software.\nThe TC68Ks at BBN are distributed\
    \ about several buildings.  To provide\nan operational tool to test remote TC68Ks,\
    \ the TC68K software was\nconfigured to put a user Telnet back to back with a\
    \ server Telnet.  An\noperator can open a connection to a remote TC68K and appear\
    \ to be a\nterminal local to that unit.  This verifies that the network path\n\
    between the two units is operational and provides the operator with\naccess to\
    \ statistics that are kept as part of the standard user\nTC-Telnet application.\n\
    \   Operator's         Local                  Remote         Remote\n   Terminal\
    \   <=TTY=> user      <=FiberNet=> server <=PTY=> user\n                     \
    \ TC-Telnet              Telnet         TC-Telnet\nThis solution was attractive\
    \ as the only extra piece of software\nnecessary for this was the \"Pseudo Teletype\"\
    \ (PTY) device driver for\nMOS.  This \"device\" appears as a terminal to its\
    \ application, but what\nit is really doing is providing a character stream between\
    \ two\nprocesses.\n"
