  - "1.  Introduction\n   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [Mannie04]\
    \ aims to\n   extend MPLS to encompass a number of transport architectures,\n\
    \   including optical networks that incorporate a number of all-optical\n   and\
    \ opto-electronic elements, such as optical cross-connects with\n   both optical\
    \ and electrical fabrics, transponders, and optical add-\n   drop multiplexers.\
    \  Optical networking poses a number of challenges\n   for GMPLS.  Fundamentally,\
    \ optical technology is an analog rather\n   than digital technology whereby the\
    \ optical layer is lowest in the\n   transport hierarchy and hence has an intimate\
    \ relationship with the\n   physical geography of the network.\n   GMPLS already\
    \ has incorporated extensions to deal with some of the\n   unique aspects of the\
    \ optical layer.  This contribution surveys some\n   of the aspects of optical\
    \ networks that impact routing and identifies\n   possible GMPLS responses for\
    \ each.  Routing constraints and/or\n   complications arising from the design\
    \ of network elements, the\n   accumulation of signal impairments, and the need\
    \ to guarantee the\n   physical diversity of some circuits are discussed.\n  \
    \ Since the purpose of this document is to further the specification of\n   GMPLS,\
    \ alternative approaches to controlling an optical network are\n   not discussed.\
    \  For discussions of some broader issues, see\n   [Gerstel2000] and [Strand02].\n\
    \   The organization of the contribution is as follows:\n   -  Section 2 is a\
    \ section requested by the sub-IP Area management for\n      all new documents.\
    \  It explains how this document fits into the\n      Area and into the IPO WG,\
    \ and why it is appropriate for these\n      groups.\n   -  Section 3 describes\
    \ constraints arising from the design of new\n      software controllable network\
    \ elements.\n   -  Section 4 addresses the constraints in a single all-optical\
    \ domain\n      without wavelength conversion.\n   -  Section 5 extends the discussion\
    \ to more complex networks and\n      incorporates both all-optical and opaque\
    \ architectures.\n   -  Section 6 discusses the impacts of diversity constraints.\n\
    \   -  Section 7 deals with security requirements.\n   -  Section 8 contains acknowledgments.\n\

  - "3.1.  Technology Background\n   Control plane architectural discussions (e.g.,\
    \ [Awduche99]) usually\n   assume that the only software reconfigurable network\
    \ element is an\n   optical layer cross-connect (OLXC).  There are however other\
    \ software\n   reconfigurable elements on the horizon, specifically tunable lasers\n\
    \   and receivers and reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers\n   (OADM).\
    \  These elements are illustrated in the following simple\n   example, which is\

    \ An OTS With OADMs - Functional Architecture\n   In Fig. 3-1, the part that is\
    \ on the inner side of all boxes labeled\n   \"A\" defines an all-optical subnetwork.\
    \  From a routing perspective\n   two aspects are critical:\n   -  Adaptation:\
    \ These are the functions done at the edges of the\n      subnetwork that transform\
    \ the incoming optical channel into the\n      physical wavelength to be transported\
    \ through the subnetwork.\n   -  Connectivity: This defines which pairs of edge\
    \ Adaptation\n      functions can be interconnected through the subnetwork.\n\
    \   In Fig. 3-1, D and E are DWDMs and X and Y are OADMs.  The boxes\n   labeled\
    \ \"A\" are adaptation functions.  They map one or more input\n   optical channels\
    \ assumed to be standard short reach signals into a\n   long reach (LR) wavelength\
    \ or wavelength group that will pass\n   transparently to a distant adaptation\
    \ function.  Adaptation\n   functionality that affects routing includes:\n   -\
    \  Multiplexing: Either electrical or optical TDM may be used to\n      combine\
    \ the input channels into a single wavelength.  This is done\n      to increase\
    \ effective capacity:  A typical DWDM might be able to\n      handle 100 2.5 Gb/sec\
    \ signals (250 Gb/sec total) or 50 10 Gb/sec\n      (500 Gb/sec total); combining\
    \ the 2.5 Gb/sec signals together thus\n      effectively doubles capacity.  After\
    \ multiplexing the combined\n      signal must be routed as a group to the distant\
    \ adaptation\n      function.\n   -  Adaptation Grouping: In this technique, groups\
    \ of k (e.g., 4)\n      wavelengths are managed as a group within the system and\
    \ must be\n      added/dropped as a group.  We will call such a group an\n   \
    \   \"adaptation grouping\".  Examples include so called \"wave group\"\n    \
    \  and \"waveband\" [Passmore01].  Groupings on the same system may\n      differ\
    \ in basics such as wavelength spacing, which constrain the\n      type of channels\
    \ that can be accommodated.\n   -  Laser Tunability: The lasers producing the\
    \ LR wavelengths may have\n      a fixed frequency, may be tunable over a limited\
    \ range, or may be\n      tunable over the entire range of wavelengths supported\
    \ by the\n      DWDM.  Tunability speeds may also vary.\n   Connectivity between\
    \ adaptation functions may also be limited:\n   -  As pointed out above, TDM multiplexing\
    \ and/or adaptation grouping\n      by the adaptation function forces groups of\
    \ input channels to be\n      delivered together to the same distant adaptation\
    \ function.\n   -  Only adaptation functions whose lasers/receivers are tunable\
    \ to\n      compatible frequencies can be connected.\n   -  The switching capability\
    \ of the OADMs may also be constrained.\n   For example:\n   o  There may be some\
    \ wavelengths that can not be dropped at all.\n   o  There may be a fixed relationship\
    \ between the frequency dropped\n      and the physical port on the OADM to which\
    \ it is dropped.\n   o  OADM physical design may put an upper bound on the number\
    \ of\n      adaptation groupings dropped at any single OADM.\n   For a fixed configuration\
    \ of the OADMs and adaptation functions\n   connectivity will be fixed: Each input\
    \ port will essentially be\n   hard-wired to some specific distant port.  However\
    \ this connectivity\n   can be changed by changing the configurations of the OADMs\
    \ and\n   adaptation functions.  For example, an additional adaptation grouping\n\
    \   might be dropped at an OADM or a tunable laser retuned.  In each case\n  \
    \ the port-to-port connectivity is changed.\n   These capabilities can be expected\
    \ to be under software control.\n   Today the control would rest in the vendor-supplied\
    \ Element\n   Management system (EMS), which in turn would be controlled by the\n\
    \   operator's OSes.  However in principle the EMS could participate in\n   the\
    \ GMPLS routing process.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.  Implications for Routing\n   An OTS of the sort discussed in Sec. 3.1 is\
    \ essentially a\n   geographically distributed but blocking cross-connect system.\
    \  The\n   specific port connectivity is dependent on the vendor design and also\n\
    \   on exactly what line cards have been deployed.\n   One way for GMPLS to deal\
    \ with this architecture would be to view the\n   port connectivity as externally\
    \ determined.  In this case the links\n   known to GMPLS would be groups of identically\
    \ routed wavebands.  If\n   these were reconfigured by the external EMS the resulting\n\
    \   connectivity changes would need to be detected and advertised within\n   GMPLS.\
    \  If the topology shown in Fig. 3-1 became a tree or a mesh\n   instead of the\
    \ linear topology shown, the connectivity changes could\n   result in Shared Risk\
    \ Link Group (SRLG - see Section 6.2) changes.\n   Alternatively, GMPLS could\
    \ attempt to directly control this port\n   connectivity.  The state information\
    \ needed to do this is likely to\n   be voluminous and vendor specific.\n"
- title: 4.  Wavelength Routed All-Optical Networks
  contents:
  - "4.  Wavelength Routed All-Optical Networks\n   The optical networks deployed\
    \ until recently may be called \"opaque\"\n   ([Tkach98]): each link is optically\
    \ isolated by transponders doing\n   O/E/O conversions.  They provide regeneration\
    \ with retiming and\n   reshaping, also called 3R, which eliminates transparency\
    \ to bit rates\n   and frame format.  These transponders are quite expensive and\
    \ their\n   lack of transparency also constrains the rapid introduction of new\n\
    \   services.  Thus there are strong motivators to introduce \"domains of\n  \
    \ transparency\" - all-optical subnetworks - larger than an OTS.\n   The routing\
    \ of lightpaths through an all-optical network has received\n   extensive attention.\
    \  (See [Yates99] or [Ramaswami98]).  When\n   discussing routing in an all-optical\
    \ network it is usually assumed\n   that all routes have adequate signal quality.\
    \  This may be ensured by\n   limiting all-optical networks to subnetworks of\
    \ limited geographic\n   size that are optically isolated from other parts of\
    \ the optical\n   layer by transponders.  This approach is very practical and\
    \ has been\n   applied to date, e.g., when determining the maximum length of an\n\
    \   Optical Transport System (OTS).  Furthermore operational\n   considerations\
    \ like fault isolation also make limiting the size of\n   domains of transparency\
    \ attractive.\n   There are however reasons to consider contained domains of\n\
    \   transparency in which not all routes have adequate signal quality.\n   From\
    \ a demand perspective, maximum bit rates have rapidly increased\n   from DS3\
    \ to OC-192 and soon OC-768 (40 Gb/sec).  As bit rates\n   increase it is necessary\
    \ to increase power.  This makes impairments\n   and nonlinearities more troublesome.\
    \  From a supply perspective,\n   optical technology is advancing very rapidly,\
    \ making ever-larger\n   domains possible.  In this section, we assume that these\n\
    \   considerations will lead to the deployment of a domain of\n   transparency\
    \ that is too large to ensure that all potential routes\n   have adequate signal\
    \ quality for all circuits.  Our goal is to\n   understand the impacts of the\
    \ various types of impairments in this\n   environment.\n   Note that, as we describe\
    \ later in the section, there are many types\n   of physical impairments.  Which\
    \ of these needs to be dealt with\n   explicitly when performing on-line distributed\
    \ routing will vary\n   considerably and will depend on many variables, including:\n\
    \   -  Equipment vendor design choices,\n   -  Fiber characteristics,\n   -  Service\
    \ characteristics (e.g., circuit speeds),\n   -  Network size,\n   -  Network\
    \ operator engineering and deployment strategies.\n   For example, a metropolitan\
    \ network that does not intend to support\n   bit rates above 2.5 Gb/sec may not\
    \ be constrained by any of these\n   impairments, while a continental or international\
    \ network that wished\n   to minimize O/E/O regeneration investment and support\
    \ 40 Gb/sec\n   connections might have to explicitly consider many of them.  Also,\
    \ a\n   network operator may reduce or even eliminate their constraint set by\n\
    \   building a relatively small domain of transparency to ensure that all\n  \
    \ the paths are feasible, or by using some proprietary tools based on\n   rules\
    \ from the OTS vendor to pre-qualify paths between node pairs and\n   put them\
    \ in a table that can be accessed each time a routing decision\n   has to be made\
    \ through that domain.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Problem Formulation
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Problem Formulation\n   We consider a single domain of transparency without\
    \ wavelength\n   translation.  Additionally, due to the proprietary nature of\
    \ DWDM\n   transmission technology, we assume that the domain is either single\n\
    \   vendor or architected using a single coherent design, particularly\n   with\
    \ regard to the management of impairments.\n   We wish to route a unidirectional\
    \ circuit from ingress client node X\n   to egress client node Y.  At both X and\
    \ Y, the circuit goes through\n   an O/E/O conversion that optically isolates\
    \ the portion within our\n   domain.  We assume that we know the bit rate of the\
    \ circuit.  Also,\n   we assume that the adaptation function at X may apply some\
    \ Forward\n   Error Correction (FEC) method to the circuit.  We also assume we\
    \ know\n   the launch power of the laser at X.\n   Impairments can be classified\
    \ into two categories, linear and\n   nonlinear.  (See [Tkach98] or [Kaminow02]\
    \ for more on impairment\n   constraints.)  Linear effects are independent of\
    \ signal power and\n   affect wavelengths individually.  Amplifier spontaneous\
    \ emission\n   (ASE), polarization mode dispersion (PMD), and chromatic dispersion\n\
    \   are examples.  Nonlinearities are significantly more complex: they\n   generate\
    \ not only impairments on each channel, but also crosstalk\n   between channels.\n\
    \   In the remainder of this section we first outline how two key linear\n   impairments\
    \ (PMD and ASE) might be handled by a set of analytical\n   formulae as additional\
    \ constraints on routing.  We next discuss how\n   the remaining constraints might\
    \ be approached.  Finally we take a\n   broader perspective and discuss the implications\
    \ of such constraints\n   on control plane architecture and also on broader constrained\
    \ domain\n   of transparency architecture issues.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD)
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD)\n   For a transparent fiber segment,\
    \ the general PMD requirement is that\n   the time-average differential group\
    \ delay (DGD) between two\n   orthogonal state of polarizations should be less\
    \ than some fraction a\n   of the bit duration, T=1/B, where B is the bit rate.\
    \  The value of\n   the parameter a depends on three major factors: 1) margin\
    \ allocated\n   to PMD, e.g., 1dB; 2) targeted outage probability, e.g., 4x10-5,\
    \ and\n   3) sensitivity of the receiver to DGD.  A typical value for a is 10%\n\
    \   [ITU].  More aggressive designs to compensate for PMD may allow\n   values\
    \ higher than 10%.  (This would be a system parameter dependent\n   on the system\
    \ design.  It would need to be known to the routing\n   process.)\n   The PMD\
    \ parameter (Dpmd) is measured in pico-seconds (ps) per\n   sqrt(km).  The square\
    \ of the PMD in a fiber span, denoted as span-\n   PMD-square is then given by\
    \ the product of Dpmd**2 and the span\n   length.  (A fiber span in a transparent\
    \ network refers to a segment\n   between two optical amplifiers.)  If Dpmd is\
    \ constant, this results\n   in a upper bound on the maximum length of an M-fiber-span\
    \ transparent\n   segment, which is inversely proportional to the square of the\
    \ product\n   of bit rate and Dpmd (the detailed equation is omitted due to the\n\
    \   format constraint - see [Strand01] for details).\n   For older fibers with\
    \ a typical PMD parameter of 0.5 picoseconds per\n   square root of km, based\
    \ on the constraint, the maximum length of the\n   transparent segment should\
    \ not exceed 400km and 25km for bit rates of\n   10Gb/s and 40Gb/s, respectively.\
    \  Due to recent advances in fiber\n   technology, the PMD-limited distance has\
    \ increased dramatically.  For\n   newer fibers with a PMD parameter of 0.1 picosecond\
    \ per square root\n   of km, the maximum length of the transparent segment (without\
    \ PMD\n   compensation) is limited to 10000km and 625km for bit rates of 10Gb/s\n\
    \   and 40Gb/, respectively.  Still lower values of PMD are attainable in\n  \
    \ commercially available fiber today, and the PMD limit can be further\n   extended\
    \ if a larger value of the parameter a (ratio of DGD to the\n   bit period) can\
    \ be tolerated.  In general, the PMD requirement is not\n   an issue for most\
    \ types of fibers at 10Gb/s or lower bit rate.  But\n   it will become an issue\
    \ at bit rates of 40Gb/s and higher.\n   If the PMD parameter varies between spans,\
    \ a slightly more\n   complicated equation results (see [Strand01]), but in any\
    \ event the\n   only link dependent information needed by the routing algorithm\
    \ is\n   the square of the link PMD, denoted as link-PMD-square.  It is the\n\
    \   sum of the span-PMD-square of all spans on the link.\n   Note that when one\
    \ has some viable PMD compensation devices and\n   deploy them ubiquitously on\
    \ all routes with potential PMD issues in\n   the network, then the PMD constraint\
    \ disappears from the routing\n   perspective.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Amplifier Spontaneous Emission
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Amplifier Spontaneous Emission\n   ASE degrades the optical signal to noise\
    \ ratio (OSNR).  An acceptable\n   optical SNR level (SNRmin), which depends on\
    \ the bit rate,\n   transmitter-receiver technology (e.g., FEC), and margins allocated\n\
    \   for the impairments, needs to be maintained at the receiver.  In\n   order\
    \ to satisfy this requirement, vendors often provide some general\n   engineering\
    \ rule in terms of maximum length of the transparent\n   segment and number of\
    \ spans.  For example, current transmission\n   systems are often limited to up\
    \ to 6 spans each 80km long.  For\n   larger transparent domains, more detailed\
    \ OSNR computations will be\n   needed to determine whether the OSNR level through\
    \ a domain of\n   transparency is acceptable.  This would provide flexibility\
    \ in\n   provisioning or restoring a lightpath through a transparent\n   subnetwork.\n\
    \   Assume that the average optical power launched at the transmitter is\n   P.\
    \  The lightpath from the transmitter to the receiver goes through M\n   optical\
    \ amplifiers, with each introducing some noise power.  Unity\n   gain can be used\
    \ at all amplifier sites to maintain constant signal\n   power at the input of\
    \ each span to minimize noise power and\n   nonlinearity.  A constraint on the\
    \ maximum number of spans can be\n   obtained [Kaminow97] which is proportional\
    \ to P and inversely\n   proportional to SNRmin, optical bandwidth B, amplifier\
    \ gain G-1 and\n   spontaneous emission factor n of the optical amplifier, assuming\
    \ all\n   spans have identical gain and noise figure.  (Again, the detailed\n\
    \   equation is omitted due to the format constraint - see [Strand01] for\n  \
    \ details.)  Let's take a typical example.  Assuming P=4dBm,\n   SNRmin=20dB with\
    \ FEC, B=12.5GHz, n=2.5, G=25dB, based on the\n   constraint, the maximum number\
    \ of spans is at most 10.  However, if\n   FEC is not used and the requirement\

  - "4.4.  Approximating the Effects of Some Other Impairment Constraints\n   There\
    \ are a number of other impairment constraints that we believe\n   could be approximated\
    \ with a domain-wide margin on the OSNR, plus in\n   some cases a constraint on\
    \ the total number of networking elements\n   (OXC or OADM) along the path.  Most\
    \ impairments generated at OXCs or\n   OADMs, including polarization dependent\
    \ loss, coherent crosstalk, and\n   effective passband width, could be dealt with\
    \ using this approach.\n   In principle, impairments generated at the nodes can\
    \ be bounded by\n   system engineering rules because the node elements can be\
    \ designed\n   and specified in a uniform manner.  This approach is not feasible\n\
    \   with PMD and noise because neither can be uniformly specified.\n   Instead,\
    \ they depend on node spacing and the characteristics of the\n   installed fiber\
    \ plant, neither of which are likely to be under the\n   system designer's control.\n\
    \   Examples of the constraints we propose to approximate with a domain-\n   wide\
    \ margin are given in the remaining paragraphs in this section.\n   It should\
    \ be kept in mind that as optical transport technology\n   evolves it may become\
    \ necessary to include some of these impairments\n   explicitly in the routing\
    \ process.  Other impairments not mentioned\n   here at all may also become sufficiently\
    \ important to require\n   incorporation either explicitly or via a domain-wide\
    \ margin.\n   Other Polarization Dependent Impairments\n      Other polarization-dependent\
    \ effects besides PMD influence system\n      performance.  For example, many\
    \ components have polarization-\n      dependent loss (PDL) [Ramaswami98], which\
    \ accumulates in a system\n      with many components on the transmission path.\
    \  The state of\n      polarization fluctuates with time and its distribution\
    \ is very\n      important also.  It is generally required that the total PDL\
    \ on\n      the path be maintained within some acceptable limit, potentially\n\
    \      by using some compensation technology for relatively long\n      transmission\
    \ systems, plus a small built-in margin in OSNR.  Since\n      the total PDL increases\
    \ with the number of components in the data\n      path, it must be taken into\
    \ account by the system vendor when\n      determining the maximum allowable number\
    \ of spans.\n   Chromatic Dispersion\n      In general this impairment can be\
    \ adequately (but not optimally)\n      compensated for on a per-link basis, and/or\
    \ at system initial\n      setup time.  Today most deployed compensation devices\
    \ are based on\n      Dispersion Compensation Fiber (DCF).  DCF provides per fiber\n\
    \      compensation by means of a spool of fiber with a CD coefficient\n     \
    \ opposite to the fiber.  Due to the imperfect matching between the\n      CD\
    \ slope of the fiber and the DCF some lambdas can be over\n      compensated while\
    \ others can be under compensated.  Moreover DCF\n      modules may only be available\
    \ in fixed lengths of compensating\n      fiber; this means that sometimes it\
    \ is impossible to find a DCF\n      module that exactly compensates the CD introduced\
    \ by the fiber.\n      These effects introduce what is known as residual CD. \
    \ Residual CD\n      varies with the frequency of the wavelength.  Knowing the\n\
    \      characteristics of both of the fiber and the DCF modules along the\n  \
    \    path, this can be calculated with a sufficient degree of\n      precision.\
    \  However this is a very challenging task.  In fact the\n      per-wavelength\
    \ residual dispersion needs to be combined with other\n      information in the\
    \ system (e.g., types fibers to figure out the\n      amount of nonlinearities)\
    \ to obtain the net effect of CD either by\n      simulation or by some analytical\
    \ approximation.  It appears that\n      the routing/control plane should not\
    \ be burdened by such a large\n      set of information while it can be handled\
    \ at the system design\n      level.  Therefore it will be assumed until proven\
    \ otherwise that\n      residual dispersion should not be reported.  For high\
    \ bit rates,\n      dynamic dispersion compensation may be required at the receiver\
    \ to\n      clean up any residual dispersion.\n   Crosstalk\n      Optical crosstalk\
    \ refers to the effect of other signals on the\n      desired signal.  It includes\
    \ both coherent (i.e., intrachannel)\n      crosstalk and incoherent (i.e., interchannel)\
    \ crosstalk.  Main\n      contributors of crosstalk are the OADM and OXC sites\
    \ that use a\n      DWDM multiplexer/demultiplexer (MUX/DEMUX) pair.  For a relatively\n\
    \      sparse network where the number of OADM/OXC nodes on a path is\n      low,\
    \ crosstalk can be treated with a low margin in OSNR without\n      being a binding\
    \ constraint.  But for some relatively dense\n      networks where crosstalk might\
    \ become a binding constraint, one\n      needs to propagate the per-link crosstalk\
    \ information to make sure\n      that the end-to-end path crosstalk which is\
    \ the sum of the\n      crosstalks on all the corresponding links to be within\
    \ some limit,\n      e.g., -25dB threshold with 1dB penalty ([Goldstein94]). \
    \ Another\n      way to treat it without having to propagate per-link crosstalk\n\
    \      information is to have the system evaluate what the maximum number\n  \
    \    of OADM/OXC nodes that has a MUX/DEMUX pair for the worst route in\n    \
    \  the transparent domain for a low built-in margin.  The latter one\n      should\
    \ work well where all the OXC/OADM nodes have similar level\n      of crosstalk.\n\
    \   Effective Passband\n      As more and more DWDM components are cascaded, the\
    \ effective\n      passband narrows.  The number of filters along the link, their\n\
    \      passband width and their shape will determine the end-to-end\n      effective\
    \ passband.  In general, this is a system design issue,\n      i.e., the system\
    \ is designed with certain maximum bit rate using\n      the proper modulation\
    \ format and filter spacing.  For linear\n      systems, the filter effect can\
    \ be turned into a constraint on the\n      maximum number of narrow filters with\
    \ the condition that filters\n      in the systems are at least as wide as the\
    \ one in the receiver.\n      Because traffic at lower bit rates can tolerate\
    \ a narrower\n      passband, the maximum allowable number of narrow filters will\n\
    \      increase as the bit rate decreases.\n   Nonlinear Impairments\n      It\
    \ seems unlikely that these can be dealt with explicitly in a\n      routing algorithm\
    \ because they lead to constraints that can couple\n      routes together and\
    \ lead to complex dependencies, e.g., on the\n      order in which specific fiber\
    \ types are traversed [Kaminow97].\n      Note that different fiber types (standard\
    \ single mode fiber,\n      dispersion shifted fiber, dispersion compensated fiber,\
    \ etc.) have\n      very different effects from nonlinear impairments.  A full\n\
    \      treatment of the nonlinear constraints would likely require very\n    \
    \  detailed knowledge of the physical infrastructure, including\n      measured\
    \ dispersion values for each span, fiber core area and\n      composition, as\
    \ well as knowledge of subsystem details such as\n      dispersion compensation\
    \ technology.  This information would need\n      to be combined with knowledge\
    \ of the current loading of optical\n      signals on the links of interest to\
    \ determine the level of\n      nonlinear impairment.  Alternatively, one could\
    \ assume that\n      nonlinear impairments are bounded and result in X dB margin\
    \ in the\n      required OSNR level for a given bit rate, where X for performance\n\
    \      reasons would be limited to 1 or 2 dB, consequently setting a\n      limit\
    \ on the maximum number of spans.  For the approach described\n      here to be\
    \ useful, it is desirable for this span length limit to\n      be longer than\
    \ that imposed by the constraints which can be\n      treated explicitly.  When\
    \ designing a DWDM transport system, there\n      are tradeoffs between signal\
    \ power launched at the transmitter,\n      span length, and nonlinear effects\
    \ on BER that need to be\n      considered jointly.  Here, we assume that an X\
    \ dB margin is\n      obtained after the transport system has been designed with\
    \ a fixed\n      signal power and maximum span length for a given bit rate.  Note\n\
    \      that OTSs can be designed in very different ways, in linear,\n      pseudo-linear,\
    \ or nonlinear environments.  The X-dB margin\n      approach may be valid for\
    \ some but not for others.  However, it is\n      likely that there is an advantage\
    \ in designing systems that are\n      less aggressive with respect to nonlinearities,\
    \ and therefore\n      somewhat sub-optimal, in exchange for improved scalability,\n\
    \      simplicity and flexibility in routing and control plane design.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.6.  An Alternative Approach - Using Maximum Distance as the Only\n      Constraint\n\
    \   Today, carriers often use maximum distance to engineer point-to-point\n  \
    \ OTS systems given a fixed per-span length based on the OSNR\n   constraint for\
    \ a given bit rate.  They may desire to keep the same\n   engineering rule when\
    \ they move to all-optical networks.  Here, we\n   discuss the assumptions that\
    \ need to be satisfied to keep this\n   approach viable and how to treat the network\
    \ elements between two\n   adjacent links.\n   In order to use the maximum distance\
    \ for a given bit rate to meet an\n   OSNR constraint as the only binding constraint,\
    \ the operators need to\n   satisfy the following constraints in their all-optical\
    \ networks:\n   -  All the other non-OSNR constraints described in the previous\n\
    \      subsections are not binding factors as long as the maximum\n      distance\
    \ constraint is met.\n   -  Specifically for PMD, this means that the whole all-optical\n\
    \      network is built on top of sufficiently low-PMD fiber such that\n     \
    \ the upper bound on the mean aggregate path DGD is always satisfied\n      for\
    \ any path that does not exceed the maximum distance, or PMD\n      compensation\
    \ devices might be used for routes with high-PMD\n      fibers.\n   -  In terms\
    \ of the ASE/OSNR constraint, in order to convert the ASE\n      constraint into\
    \ a distance constraint directly, the network needs\n      to have a fixed fiber\
    \ distance D for each span (so that ASE can be\n      directly mapped by the gain\
    \ of the amplifier which equals to the\n      loss of the previous fiber span),\
    \ e.g., 80km spacing which is\n      commonly chosen by carriers.  However, when\
    \ spans have variable\n      lengths, certain adjustment and compromise need to\
    \ be made in\n      order to avoid treating ASE explicitly as in section 4.3.\
    \  These\n      include: 1) Unless a certain mechanism is built in the OTS to\
    \ take\n      advantage of shorter spans, spans shorter than a typical span\n\
    \      length D need to be treated as a span of length D instead of with\n   \
    \   its real length.  2) Spans that are longer than D would have a\n      higher\
    \ average span loss.  In general, the maximum system reach\n      decreases when\
    \ the average span loss increases.  Thus, in order to\n      accommodate longer\
    \ spans in the network, the maximum distance\n      upper bound has to be set\
    \ with respect to the average span loss of\n      the worst path in the network.\
    \  This sub-optimality may be\n      acceptable for some networks if the variance\
    \ is not too large, but\n      may be too conservative for others.\n   If these\
    \ assumptions are satisfied, the second issue we need to\n   address is how to\
    \ treat a transparent network element (e.g., MEMS-\n   based switch) between two\
    \ adjacent links in terms of a distance\n   constraint since it also introduces\
    \ an insertion loss.  If the\n   network element cannot somehow compensate for\
    \ this OSNR degradation,\n   one approach is to convert each network element into\
    \ an equivalent\n   length of fiber based on its loss/ASE contribution.  Hence,\
    \ in\n   general, introducing a set of transparent network elements would\n  \
    \ effectively result in reducing the overall actual transmission\n   distance\
    \ between the OEO edges.\n   With this approach, the link-specific state information\
    \ is link-\n   distance, the length of a link.  It equals the distance sum of\
    \ all\n   fiber spans on the link and the equivalent length of fiber for the\n\
    \   network element(s) on the link.  The constraint is that the sum of\n   all\
    \ the link-distance over all links of a path should be less than\n   the maximum-path-distance,\
    \ the upper bound of all paths.\n"
- title: 4.7.  Other Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.7.  Other Considerations\n   Routing in an all-optical network without wavelength\
    \ conversion\n   raises several additional issues:\n   -  Since the route selected\
    \ must have the chosen wavelength available\n      on all links, this information\
    \ needs to be considered in the\n      routing process.  One approach is to propagate\
    \ information\n      throughout the network about the state of every wavelength\
    \ on\n      every link in the network.  However, the state required and the\n\
    \      overhead involved in processing and maintaining this information\n    \
    \  is proportional to the total number of links (thus, number of\n      nodes\
    \ squared), maximum number of wavelengths (which keeps\n      doubling every couple\
    \ of years), and the frequency of wavelength\n      availability changes, which\
    \ can be very high.  Instead\n      [Hjalmtysson00], proposes an alternative method\
    \ which probes along\n      a chosen path to determine which wavelengths (if any)\
    \ are\n      available.  This would require a significant addition to the\n  \
    \    routing logic normally used in OSPF.  Others have proposed\n      simultaneously\

    \ along the path is\n      known to give adequate results in simple topologies\
    \ such as rings\n      and trees ([Yates99]).  This does not appear to be true\
    \ in large\n      mesh networks under realistic provisioning scenarios, however.\n\
    \      Instead significantly better results are achieved if wavelength\n     \
    \ and route are chosen simultaneously ([Strand01b]).  This approach\n      would\
    \ however also have a significant effect on OSPF.\n"
- title: 4.8.  Implications For Routing and Control Plane Design
  contents:
  - "4.8.  Implications For Routing and Control Plane Design\n   If distributed routing\
    \ is desired, additional state information will\n   be required by the routing\
    \ to deal with the impairments described in\n   Sections 4.2 - 4.4:\n   -  As\
    \ mentioned earlier, an operator who wants to avoid having to\n      provide impairment-related\
    \ parameters to the control plane may\n      elect not to deal with them at the\
    \ routing level, instead treating\n      them at the system design and planning\
    \ level if that is a viable\n      approach for their network.  In this approach\
    \ the operator can\n      pre-qualify all or a set of feasible end-to-end optical\
    \ paths\n      through the domain of transparency for each bit rate.  This\n \
    \     approach may work well with relatively small and sparse networks,\n    \
    \  but it may not be scalable for large and dense networks where the\n      number\
    \ of feasible paths can be very large.\n   -  If the optical paths are not pre-qualified,\
    \ additional link-\n      specific state information will be required by the routing\n\
    \      algorithm for each type of impairment that has the potential of\n     \
    \ being limiting for some routes.  Note that for one operator, PMD\n      might\
    \ be the only limiting constraint while for another, ASE might\n      be the only\
    \ one, or it could be both plus some other constraints\n      considered in this\
    \ document.  Some networks might not be limited\n      by any of these constraints.\n\
    \   -  For an operator needing to deal explicitly with these constraints,\n  \
    \    the link-dependent information identified above for PMD is link-\n      PMD-square\
    \ which is the square of the total PMD on a link.  For\n      ASE the link-dependent\
    \ information identified is link-noise which\n      is the total noise on a link.\
    \  Other link-dependent information\n      includes link-span-length which is\
    \ the total number of spans on a\n      link, link-crosstalk or OADM-OXC-number\
    \ which is the total\n      crosstalk or the number of OADM/OXC nodes on a link,\
    \ respectively,\n      and filter-number which is the number of narrow filters\
    \ on a link.\n      When the alternative distance-only approach is chosen, the\
    \ link-\n      specific information is link-distance.\n   -  In addition to the\
    \ link-specific information, bounds on each of\n      the impairments need to\
    \ be quantified.  Since these bounds are\n      determined by the system designer's\
    \ impairment allocations, these\n      will be system dependent.  For PMD, the\
    \ constraint is that the sum\n      of the link-PMD-square of all links on the\
    \ transparent segment is\n      less than the square of (a/B) where B is the bit\
    \ rate.  Hence, the\n      required information is the parameter \"a\".  For ASE,\
    \ the\n      constraint is that the sum of the link-noise of all links is no\n\
    \      larger than P/SNRmin.  Thus, the information needed include the\n     \
    \ launch power P and OSNR requirement SNRmin.  The minimum\n      acceptable OSNR,\
    \ in turn, depends on the strength of the FEC being\n      used and the margins\
    \ reserved for other types of impairments.\n      Other bounds include the maximum\
    \ span length of the transmission\n      system, the maximum path crosstalk or\
    \ the maximum number of\n      OADM/OXC nodes, and the maximum number of narrow\
    \ filters, all are\n      bit rate dependent.  With the alternative distance-only\
    \ approach,\n      the upper bound is the maximum-path-distance.  In single-vendor\n\
    \      \"islands\" some of these parameters may be available in a local or\n \
    \     EMS database and would not need to be advertised\n   -  It is likely that\
    \ the physical layer parameters do not change\n      value rapidly and could be\
    \ stored in some database; however these\n      are physical layer parameters\
    \ that today are frequently not known\n      at the granularity required.  If\
    \ the ingress node of a lightpath\n      does path selection these parameters\
    \ would need to be available at\n      this node.\n   -  The specific constraints\
    \ required in a given situation will depend\n      on the design and engineering\
    \ of the domain of transparency; for\n      example it will be essential to know\
    \ whether chromatic dispersion\n      has been dealt with on a per-link basis,\
    \ and whether the domain is\n      operating in a linear or nonlinear regime.\n\
    \   -  As optical transport technology evolves, the set of constraints\n     \
    \ that will need to be considered either explicitly or via a\n      domain-wide\
    \ margin may change.  The routing and control plane\n      design should therefore\

    \   -  In the absence of wavelength conversion, the necessity of finding\n   \
    \   a single wavelength that is available on all links introduces the\n      need\
    \ to either advertise detailed information on wavelength\n      availability,\
    \ which probably doesn't scale, or have some mechanism\n      for probing potential\
    \ routes with or without crankback to\n      determine wavelength availability.\

    \  It is extremely important to\n   realize that, at least in the short to intermediate\
    \ term, the\n   resources committed by a single routing decision can be very\n\
    \   significant: The equipment tied up by a single coast-to-coast OC-192\n   can\
    \ easily have a first cost of $10**6, and the holding times on a\n   circuit once\
    \ established is likely to be measured in months.\n   Carriers will expect the\
    \ routing algorithms used to be sensitive to\n   these costs.  Simplistic measures\
    \ of cost such as the number of\n   \"hops\" are not likely to be acceptable.\n\
    \   Taking the case of an all-optical island consisting of an \"ultra\n   long-haul\"\
    \ system like that in Fig. 3-1 embedded in an OEO network of\n   electrical fabric\
    \ OLXCs as an example: It is likely that the ULH\n   system will be relatively\
    \ expensive for short hops but relatively\n   economical for longer distances.\
    \  It is therefore likely to be\n   deployed as a sort of \"express backbone\"\
    .  In this scenario a carrier\n   is likely to expect the routing algorithm to\
    \ balance OEO costs\n   against the additional costs associated with ULH technology\
    \ and route\n   circuitously to make maximum use of the backbone where appropriate.\n\
    \   Note that the metrics used to do this must be consistent throughout\n   the\
    \ routing domain if this expectation is to be met.\n   The first-order implications\
    \ for GMPLS seem to be:\n   -  Information about island boundaries needs to be\
    \ advertised.\n   -  The routing algorithm needs to be sensitive to island transitions\n\
    \      and to the connectivity limitations and impairment constraints\n      particular\
    \ to each island.\n   -  The cost function used in routing must allow the balancing\
    \ of\n      transponder costs, OXC and OADM costs, and line haul costs across\n\
    \      the entire routing domain.\n   Several distributed approaches to multi-island\
    \ routing seem worth\n   investigating:\n   -  Advertise the internal topology\
    \ and constraints of each island\n      globally; let the ingress node compute\
    \ an end-to-end strict\n      explicit route sensitive to all constraints and\
    \ wavelength\n      availabilities.  In this approach the routing algorithm used\
    \ by\n      the ingress node must be able to deal with the details of routing\n\
    \      within each island.\n   -  Have the EMS or control plane of each island\
    \ determine and\n      advertise the connectivity between its boundary nodes together\n\
    \      with additional information such as costs and the bit rates and\n     \
    \ formats supported.  As the spare capacity situation changes,\n      updates\
    \ would be advertised.  In this approach impairment\n      constraints are handled\
    \ within each island and impairment-related\n      parameters need not be advertised\
    \ outside of the island.  The\n      ingress node would then do a loose explicit\
    \ route and leave the\n      routing and wavelength selection within each island\
    \ to the island.\n   -  Have the ingress node send out probes or queries to nearby\
    \ gateway\n      nodes or to an NMS to get routing guidance.\n"

  - "6.1.  Background on Diversity\n   \"Diversity\" is a relationship between lightpaths.\
    \  Two lightpaths are\n   said to be diverse if they have no single point of failure.\
    \  In\n   traditional telephony the dominant transport failure mode is a\n   failure\
    \ in the interoffice plant, such as a fiber cut inflicted by a\n   backhoe.\n\
    \   Why is diversity a unique problem that needs to be considered for\n   optical\
    \ networks?  Traditionally, data network operators have relied\n   on their private\
    \ line providers to ensure diversity and so have not\n   had to deal directly\
    \ with the problem.  GMPLS makes the complexities\n   handled by the private line\
    \ provisioning process, including\n   diversity, part of the common control plane\
    \ and so visible to all.\n   To determine whether two lightpath routings are diverse\
    \ it is\n   necessary to identify single points of failure in the interoffice\n\
    \   plant.  To do so we will use the following terms: A fiber cable is a\n   uniform\
    \ group of fibers contained in a sheath.  An Optical Transport\n   System will\
    \ occupy fibers in a sequence of fiber cables.  Each fiber\n   cable will be placed\
    \ in a sequence of conduits - buried honeycomb\n   structures through which fiber\
    \ cables may be pulled - or buried in a\n   right of way (ROW).  A ROW is land\
    \ in which the network operator has\n   the right to install his conduit or fiber\
    \ cable.  It is worth noting\n   that for economic reasons, ROWs are frequently\
    \ obtained from\n   railroads, pipeline companies, or thruways.  It is frequently\
    \ the\n   case that several carriers may lease ROW from the same source; this\n\
    \   makes it common to have a number of carriers' fiber cables in close\n   proximity\
    \ to each other.  Similarly, in a metropolitan network,\n   several carriers might\
    \ be leasing duct space in the same RBOC\n   conduit.  There are also \"carrier's\
    \ carriers\" - optical networks\n   which provide fibers to multiple carriers,\
    \ all of whom could be\n   affected by a single failure in the \"carrier's carrier\"\
    \ network.  In\n   a typical intercity facility network there might be on the\
    \ order of\n   100 offices that are candidates for OLXCs.  To represent the inter-\n\
    \   office fiber network accurately a network with an order of magnitude\n   more\
    \ nodes is required.  In addition to Optical Amplifier (OA) sites,\n   these additional\
    \ nodes include:\n   -  Places where fiber cables enter/leave a conduit or right\
    \ of way;\n   -  Locations where fiber cables cross; Locations where fiber splices\n\
    \      are used to interchange fibers between fiber cables.\n   An example of\
    \ the first might be:\n                                    A                 B\n\
    \      A-------------B                 \\             /\n                    \
    \                    \\         /\n                                          X-----Y\n\

    \                /             \\\n                                    C     \
    \            D\n      (a) Fiber Cable Topology      (b) Right-Of-Way/Conduit Topology\n\
    \             Figure 6-1:  Fiber Cable vs. ROW Topologies\n   Here the A-B fiber\
    \ cable would be physically routed A-X-Y-B and the\n   C-D cable would be physically\
    \ routed C-X-Y-D.  This topology might\n   arise because of some physical bottleneck:\
    \ X-Y might be the Lincoln\n   Tunnel, for example, or the Bay Bridge.\n   Fiber\
    \ route crossing (the second case) is really a special case of\n   this, where\
    \ X and Y coincide.  In this case the crossing point may\n   not even be a manhole;\
    \ the fiber routes might just be buried at\n   different depths.\n   Fiber splicing\
    \ (the third case) often occurs when a major fiber route\n   passes near to a\
    \ small office.  To avoid the expense and additional\n   transmission loss only\
    \ a small number of fibers are spliced out of\n   the major route into a smaller\
    \ route going to the small office.  This\n   might well occur in a manhole or\
    \ hut.  An example is shown in Fig.\n   6-2(a), where A-X-B is the major route,\
    \ X the manhole, and C the\n   smaller office.  The actual fiber topology would\
    \ then look like Fig.\n   6-2(b), where there would typically be many more A-B\
    \ fibers than A-C\n   or C-B fibers, and where A-C and C-B might have different\
    \ numbers of\n   fibers.  (One of the latter might even be missing.)\n       \

    \  Fiber Cable vs Fiber Topologies\n   The imminent deployment of ultra-long (>1000\
    \ km) Optical Transport\n   Systems introduces a further complexity: Two OTSes\
    \ could interact a\n   number of times.  To make up a hypothetical example: A\
    \ New York -\n   Atlanta OTS and a Philadelphia - Orlando OTS might ride on the\
    \ same\n   right of way for x miles in Maryland and then again for y miles in\n\
    \   Georgia.  They might also cross at Raleigh or some other intermediate\n  \
    \ node without sharing right of way.\n   Diversity is often equated to routing\
    \ two lightpaths between a single\n   pair of points, or different pairs of points\
    \ so that no single route\n   failure will disrupt them both.  This is too simplistic,\
    \ for a number\n   of reasons:\n   -  A sophisticated client of an optical network\
    \ will want to derive\n      diversity needs from his/her end customers' availability\n\
    \      requirements.  These often lead to more complex diversity\n      requirements\
    \ than simply providing diversity between two\n      lightpaths.  For example,\
    \ a common requirement is that no single\n      failure should isolate a node\
    \ or nodes.  If a node A has single\n      lightpaths to nodes B and C, this requires\
    \ A-B and A-C to be\n      diverse.  In real applications, a large data network\
    \ with N\n      lightpaths between its routers might describe their needs in an\n\
    \      NxN matrix, where (i,j) defines whether lightpaths i and j must be\n  \
    \    diverse.\n   -  Two circuits that might be considered diverse for one application\n\
    \      might not be considered diverse for in another situation.\n      Diversity\
    \ is usually thought of as a reaction to interoffice route\n      failures.  High\
    \ reliability applications may require other types\n      of failures to be taken\
    \ into account.  Some examples:\n      o  Office Outages: Although less frequent\
    \ than route failures,\n         fires, power outages, and floods do occur.  Many\
    \ network\n         managers require that diverse routes have no (intermediate)\n\
    \         nodes in common.  In other cases an intermediate node might be\n   \
    \      acceptable as long as there is power diversity within the\n         office.\n\
    \      o  Shared Rings: Many applications are willing to allow \"diverse\"\n \
    \        circuits to share a SONET ring-protected link; presumably they\n    \
    \     would allow the same for optical layer rings.\n      o  Disasters: Earthquakes\
    \ and floods can cause failures over an\n         extended area.  Defense Department\
    \ circuits might need to be\n         routed with nuclear damage radii taken into\
    \ account.\n   -  Conversely, some networks may be willing to take somewhat larger\n\
    \      risks.  Taking route failures as an example: Such a network might\n   \
    \   be willing to consider two fiber cables in heavy duty concrete\n      conduit\
    \ as having a low enough chance of simultaneous failure to\n      be considered\
    \ \"diverse\".  They might also be willing to view two\n      fiber cables buried\
    \ on opposite sides of a railroad track as being\n      diverse because there\
    \ is minimal danger of a single backhoe\n      disrupting them both even though\
    \ a bad train wreck might\n      jeopardize them both.  A network seeking N mutually\
    \ diverse paths\n      from an office with less than N diverse ROWs will need\
    \ to live\n      with some level of compromise in the immediate vicinity of the\n\
    \      office.\n   These considerations strongly suggest that the routing algorithm\n\
    \   should be sensitive to the types of threat considered unacceptable by\n  \
    \ the requester.  Note that the impairment constraints described in the\n   previous\
    \ section may eliminate some of the long circuitous routes\n   sometimes needed\
    \ to provide diversity.  This would make it harder to\n   find many diverse paths\
    \ through an all-optical network than an opaque\n   one.\n   [Hjalmtysson00] introduced\
    \ the term \"Shared Risk Link Group\" (SRLG)\n   to describe the relationship\
    \ between two non-diverse links.  The\n   above examples and discussion given\
    \ at the start of this section\n   suggests that an SRLG should be characterized\
    \ by 2 parameters:\n   -  Type of Compromise: Examples would be shared fiber cable,\
    \ shared\n      conduit, shared ROW, shared optical ring, shared office without\n\
    \      power sharing, etc.)\n   -  Extent of Compromise:  For compromised outside\
    \ plant, this would\n      be the length of the sharing.\n   A CSPF algorithm\
    \ could then penalize a diversity compromise by an\n   amount dependent on these\
    \ two parameters.\n   Two links could be related by many SRLGs.  (AT&T's experience\n\
    \   indicates that a link may belong to over 100 SRLGs, each\n   corresponding\
    \ to a separate fiber group.)  Each SRLG might relate a\n   single link to many\
    \ other links.  For the optical layer, similar\n   situations can be expected\
    \ where a link is an ultra-long OTS.\n   The mapping between links and different\
    \ types of SRLGs is in general\n   defined by network operators based on the definition\
    \ of each SRLG\n   type.  Since SRLG information is not yet ready to be discoverable\
    \ by\n   a network element and does not change dynamically, it need not be\n \
    \  advertised with other resource availability information by network\n   elements.\
    \  It could be configured in some central database and be\n   distributed to or\
    \ retrieved by the nodes, or advertised by network\n   elements at the topology\
    \ discovery stage.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Implications For Routing
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Implications For Routing\n   Dealing with diversity is an unavoidable requirement\
    \ for routing in\n   the optical layer.  It requires dealing with constraints\
    \ in the\n   routing process, but most importantly requires additional state\n\
    \   information (e.g., the SRLG relationships).  The routings of any\n   existing\
    \ circuits from which the new circuit must be diverse must\n   also be available\
    \ to the routing process.\n   At present SRLG information cannot be self-discovered.\
    \  Indeed, in a\n   large network it is very difficult to maintain accurate SRLG\n\
    \   information.  The problem becomes particularly daunting whenever\n   multiple\
    \ administrative domains are involved, for instance after the\n   acquisition\
    \ of one network by another, because there normally is a\n   likelihood that there\
    \ are diversity violations between the domains.\n   It is very unlikely that diversity\
    \ relationships between carriers\n   will be known any time in the near future.\n\
    \   Considerable variation in what different customers will mean by\n   acceptable\
    \ diversity should be anticipated.  Consequently we suggest\n   that an SRLG should\
    \ be defined as follows: (i) It is a relationship\n   between two or more links,\
    \ and (ii) it is characterized by two\n   parameters, the type of compromise (shared\
    \ conduit, shared ROW,\n   shared optical ring, etc.) and the extent of the compromise\
    \ (e.g.,\n   the number of miles over which the compromise persisted).  This will\n\
    \   allow the SRLGs appropriate to a particular routing request to be\n   easily\
    \ identified.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   We are assuming OEO interfaces to the domain(s)\
    \ covered by our\n   discussion (see, e.g., Sec. 4.1 above).  If this assumption\
    \ were to\n   be relaxed and externally generated optical signals allowed into\
    \ the\n   domain, network security issues would arise.  Specifically,\n   unauthorized\
    \ usage in the form of signals at improper wavelengths or\n   with power levels\
    \ or impairments inconsistent with those assumed by\n   the domain would be possible.\
    \  With OEO interfaces, these types of\n   layer one threats should be controllable.\n\
    \   A key layer one security issue is resilience in the face of physical\n   attack.\
    \  Diversity, as describe in Sec. 6, is a part of the solution.\n   However, it\
    \ is ineffective if there is not sufficient spare capacity\n   available to make\
    \ the network whole after an attack.  Several major\n   related issues are:\n\
    \   -  Defining the threat: If, for example, an electro-magnetic\n      interference\
    \ (EMI) burst is an in-scope threat, then (in the\n      terminology of Sec. 6)\
    \ all of the links sufficiently close\n      together to be disrupted by such\
    \ a burst must be included in a\n      single SRLG.  Similarly for other threats:\
    \ For each in-scope\n      threat, SRLGs must be defined so that all links vulnerable\
    \ to a\n      single incident of the threat must be grouped together in a single\n\
    \      SRLG.\n   -  Allocating responsibility for responding to a layer one failure\n\
    \      between the various layers (especially the optical and IP layers):\n  \
    \    This must be clearly specified to avoid churning and unnecessary\n      service\
    \ interruptions.\n   The whole proposed process depends on the integrity of the\
    \ impairment\n   characterization information (PMD parameters, etc.) and also\
    \ the SRLG\n   definitions.  Security of this information, both when stored and\
    \ when\n   distributed, is essential.\n   This document does not address control\
    \ plane issues, and so control-\n   plane security is out of scope.  IPO control\
    \ plane security\n   considerations are discussed in [Rajagopalam04].  Security\n\
    \   considerations for GMPLS, a likely control plane candidate, are\n   discussed\
    \ in [Mannie04].\n"
