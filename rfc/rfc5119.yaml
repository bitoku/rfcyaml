  - "1.  Introduction\n   SMPTE (the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers)\
    \ is an\n   internationally-recognized standards-developing organization.\n  \
    \ Headquartered and incorporated in the United States of America, SMPTE\n   has\
    \ members in over 80 countries on six continents.  SMPTE's\n   Engineering Documents,\
    \ including Standards, Recommended Practices,\n   and Engineering Guidelines,\
    \ are prepared by SMPTE's Technology\n   Committees.  Participation in these Committees\
    \ is open to all with a\n   bona fide interest in a committee's work.  SMPTE cooperates\
    \ closely\n   with other standards-developing organizations, including ISO, the\n\
    \   IEC, and the ITU.  Also, the SMPTE Registration Authority maintains a\n  \
    \ registry of Universal Labels (ULs) used in identifying the type and\n   encoding\
    \ of data within data streams associated with audio-visual\n   material.\n   SMPTE\
    \ would like to assign unique, permanent, and location-\n   independent names\
    \ using URNs for resources that SMPTE produces or\n   manages.\n   This namespace\
    \ specification is for a formal namespace.\n"
- title: 2.  URN Namespace Definition Template
  contents:
  - "2.  URN Namespace Definition Template\n   The following template is provided\
    \ in accordance with [RFC3406].\n      Namespace ID:\n         smpte\n      Registration\
    \ Information:\n         Version: 2\n         Date: 2007-07-08\n      Declared\
    \ registrant of the namespace:\n         Registering Organization: Society of\
    \ Motion Picture and\n                                   Television Engineers\n\
    \            Address: 3 Barker Avenue - 5th Floor\n                     White\
    \ Plains, NY 10601 USA\n         Designated Contact Person: Director of Engineering\n\
    \            Phone: +1 (914) 761-1100\n            Email: standards@smpte.org\n\
    \      Declaration of structure:\n         The Namespace Specific String (NSS)\
    \ of all URNs that use the\n         \"smpte\" NID shall be conformant to the\
    \ URN syntax requirements\n         defined in [RFC2141].\n         URNs for the\
    \ \"urn:smpte\" namespace shall follow the structure\n         defined in [SMPTE2029].\n\
    \         SMPTE (or it successor) may add additional subnamespaces\n         in\
    \ the future.  Any system that deals with URNs for the\n         \"urn:smpte\"\
    \ namespace should be written with the awareness\n         that this could occur\
    \ at any time.\n         For informative purposes, the identifier structure described\n\
    \         using ABNF (according to [RFC4234]) is as follows:\n            ;start\
    \ ABNF notation\n            URN = \"urn:\" NID NSS\n            NID = \"smpte:\"\
    \n            NSS = UL-NSS / other-NSS\n            UL-NSS = \"ul:\" UL\n    \
    \        UL = QUADBYTE *(DOT QUADBYTE)\n            DOT = %x2E ; period\n    \
    \        QUADBYTE = 4BYTE\n            BYTE = 2HEXDIG\n            other-NSS =\
    \ 1*(DIGIT / ALPHA / \"-\"/\":\")\n            ; other-NSS that conforms with\
    \ [RFC2141] for future\n            expansion\n            ;end ABNF notation\n\
    \      Relevant ancillary documentation:\n         The structure for URNs in the\
    \ \"urn:smpte\" namespace are defined\n         in [SMPTE2029].\n         The\
    \ values of ULs in the \"urn:smpte:ul\" subnamespace shall be\n         constrained\
    \ as defined in [SMPTE298M].  Details regarding the\n         use of ULs as keys\
    \ in key-length-value (KLV) coding, including\n         how to determine in which\
    \ SMPTE registry a SMPTE-administered\n         UL may be found, are described\
    \ in [SMPTE336M].\n      Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n         [SMPTE2029]\
    \ states that \"All URNs in the SMPTE namespace shall\n         conform to IETF\
    \ RFC 3406.  In particular, URNs in the SMPTE\n         namespace shall not be\
    \ re-assigned, and URNs shall continue to\n         be valid, even if the owners\
    \ or registrants of the SMPTE\n         resources identified by the URNs are no\
    \ longer members or\n         customers of SMPTE.  There need not be resolution\
    \ of such URNs,\n         but they shall not resolve to false or stale information.\"\
    \n         Additionally, the rules for assignment of SMPTE-administered\n    \
    \     ULs requires that each UL be unique to the UL space and that it\n      \
    \   cannot be reassigned or reused.\n         It should be noted that [SMPTE298M]\
    \ states that \"A universal\n         label shall be an 'object identifier' as\
    \ specified by ISO/IEC\n         8824-1,\" ([ISO8824-1]) although the SMPTE Universal\
    \ Label\n         representation is a specialized one that carries additional\n\
    \         semantics over the OID representation of a URN OID ([RFC3061]).\n  \
    \       SMPTE will work to ensure that all current and future\n         \"urn:smpte\"\
    \ subnamespaces contain unique identifiers.\n      Identifier persistence considerations:\n\
    \         SMPTE-administered ULs may occasionally be deleted through\n       \
    \  SMPTE procedures.  Regardless, even after a UL has been\n         deleted,\
    \ it will not be reused.  Revisions to ULs will result\n         in the creation\
    \ of a new UL and the deletion of the old one.\n         The persistence of URNs\
    \ in future \"urn:smpte\" subnamespaces\n         will be defined by SMPTE Standards.\n\
    \      Process of identifier assignment:\n         Assignment of URNs in the SMPTE\
    \ NID is limited to SMPTE and\n         those authorities that are specifically\
    \ designated by SMPTE.\n         SMPTE may designate portions of its namespace\
    \ for assignment by\n         other parties.\n         Due process is followed\
    \ by committees in the development of\n         SMPTE documents.  Some types of\
    \ Universal Label registrations\n         and other registrations may require\
    \ a fee to be paid to SMPTE.\n         All classes of SMPTE-administered ULs require\
    \ for registration\n         the name and address of the applicant.  Some classes\
    \ of labels\n         also require the submission of supporting technical\n  \
    \       documentation for the label and may require a due process\n         evaluation\
    \ through the SMPTE Engineering Committee process.\n      Process for identifier\
    \ resolution:\n         SMPTE-administered ULs are resolved through publications\
    \ of the\n         SMPTE Registration Authority.  Currently, publication of\n\
    \         SMPTE-administered ULs are made through a Metadata Dictionary\n    \
    \     as specified in [RP210] and through the SMPTE Labels Registry\n        \
    \ as specified in [RP224], both of which are currently available\n         online\
    \ at http://www.smpte-ra.org/mdd/.\n         SMPTE expects to develop and maintain\
    \ \"URN catalogs\" that map\n         all future assigned URNs in the \"urn:smpte\"\
    \ namespace to\n         Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to enable Web-based\
    \ resolution\n         of named resources.\n      Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n\
    \         Lexical equivalence of URNs in the \"urn:smpte:ul\" subnamespace\n \
    \        is defined by case-insensitive string match.\n         Lexical equivalence\
    \ of URNs in additional subnamespaces of\n         \"urn:smpte:\" will be specified\
    \ by SMPTE in the defining\n         document; in the absence of such specification,\
    \ lexical\n         equivalence of URNs in the \"urn:smpte:\" namespace outside\
    \ of\n         the \"urn:smpte:ul\" subnamespace is defined by exact string\n\
    \         match, according to [RFC2141].\n      Conformance with URN Syntax:\n\
    \         No special considerations beyond the syntax herein described.\n    \
    \  Validation mechanism:\n         None.\n      Scope:\n         Global.\n"

- title: 5.  Namespace Considerations and Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Namespace Considerations and Community Considerations\n   SMPTE is an internationally-recognized\
    \ standards-developing\n   organization.  As part of this effort, SMPTE also registers\
    \ items\n   such as Universal Labels through the SMPTE Registration Authority.\n\
    \   The SMPTE namespace provides a uniform, unique, and effective way to\n   communicate\
    \ resource names for these items, which can be used by the\n   motion imaging\
    \ industry community.  This namespace is also intended\n   to be a useful mechanism\
    \ to provide both human and automated access\n   to these resources through online\
    \ systems.\n   The individual URNs in the namespace shall be assigned through\
    \ the\n   process of development of documents by SMPTE, through definition by\n\
    \   SMPTE standards, or through the registration of Universal Labels or\n   other\
    \ items by the SMPTE Registration Authority.\n   RFC 3406 states that a URN registration\
    \ RFC must include a 'Namespace\n   Considerations' section, which outlines the\
    \ perceived need for a new\n   namespace.  There are four areas where existing\
    \ URN namespaces fall\n   short of the requirements for a SMPTE URN namespace.\n\
    \      URN assignment procedures: URNs for resources defined by SMPTE\n      standards\
    \ must be assigned exclusively by SMPTE or its delegates\n      to ensure the\
    \ integrity of the standards process.  No other\n      existing URN namespace\
    \ has URNs assigned and managed by SMPTE.\n      URN resolution: URNs assigned\
    \ by SMPTE standards must be resolved\n      by SMPTE mechanisms such as the SMPTE\
    \ Registration Authority to\n      ensure the integrity of the standards process.\
    \  This resolution\n      may require the reference of databases only maintained\
    \ by SMPTE.\n      Types of resources to be identified: Many resources defined\
    \ by\n      SMPTE standards (such as Universal Labels) have no adequate\n    \
    \  existing URN representation.\n      Types of services to be supported: SMPTE\
    \ expects to establish Web\n      services for the automated resolution of resources\
    \ defined by\n      SMPTE standards utilizing the SMPTE URN namespace.\n"
