    \  the Processing Rules for Internationalized Names in Section 7 of RFC\n   5280
    [RFC5280] to provide alignment with the 2008 specification for\n   Internationalized
    Domain Names (IDNs) and add support for\n   internationalized email addresses
    in X.509 certificates.\n   An IDN in Unicode (native character) form contains
    at least one\n   U-label [RFC5890].  With one exception, IDNs are carried in\n
    \  certificates in ACE-encoded form.  That is, all U-labels within an\n   IDN
    are converted to A-labels.  Conversion of a U-label to an A-label\n   is described
    in [RFC5891].\n   The GeneralName structure supports many different name forms,\n
    \  including otherName for extensibility.  RFC 8398 [RFC8398] specifies\n   the
    SmtpUTF8Mailbox for internationalized email addresses, which\n   includes IDNs
    with U-labels.\n   Note that Internationalized Domain Names in Applications\n
    \  specifications published in 2003 (IDNA2003) [RFC3490] and 2008\n   (IDNA2008)

    - "2.2.  Update in Name Constraints (Section 4.2.1.10)\n   This update removes
      the ability to include constraints for a\n   particular mailbox.  This capability
      was not used, and removing it\n   allows name constraints to apply to email
      addresses in rfc822Name and\n   SmtpUTF8Mailbox [RFC8398] within otherName.\n
      \  OLD\n   A name constraint for Internet mail addresses MAY specify a\n   particular
      mailbox, all addresses at a particular host, or all\n   mailboxes in a domain.
      \ To indicate a particular mailbox, the\n   constraint is the complete mail
      address.  For example,\n   \"root@example.com\" indicates the root mailbox on
      the host\n   \"example.com\".  To indicate all Internet mail addresses on a\n
      \  particular host, the constraint is specified as the host name.  For\n   example,
      the constraint \"example.com\" is satisfied by any mail\n   address at the host
      \"example.com\".  To specify any address within a\n   domain, the constraint
      is specified with a leading period (as with\n   URIs).  For example, \".example.com\"
      indicates all the Internet mail\n   addresses in the domain \"example.com\",
      but not Internet mail\n   addresses on the host \"example.com\".\n   NEW\n   A
      name constraint for Internet mail addresses MAY specify all\n   addresses at
      a particular host or all mailboxes in a domain.  To\n   indicate all Internet
      mail addresses on a particular host, the\n   constraint is specified as the
      host name.  For example, the\n   constraint \"example.com\" is satisfied by
      any mail address at the\n   host \"example.com\".  To specify any address within
      a domain, the\n   constraint is specified with a leading period (as with URIs).

    title: 2.2.  Update in Name Constraints (Section 4.2.1.10)
  - contents:
    - "2.3.  Update in IDNs in GeneralName (Section 7.2)\n   This update aligns with
      IDNA2008.  Since all of Section 7.2 is\n   replaced, the OLD text is not provided.\n
      \  NEW\n   Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) may be included in certificates\n
      \  and CRLs in the subjectAltName and issuerAltName extensions, name\n   constraints
      extension, authority information access extension,\n   subject information access
      extension, CRL distribution points\n   extension, and issuing distribution point
      extension.  Each of these\n   extensions uses the GeneralName type; one choice
      in GeneralName is\n   the dNSName field, which is defined as type IA5String.\n
      \  IA5String is limited to the set of ASCII characters.  To accommodate\n   IDNs,
      U-labels are converted to A-labels.  The A-label is the\n   encoding of the
      U-label according to the Punycode algorithm [RFC3492]\n   with the ACE prefix
      \"xn--\" added at the beginning of the string.\n   When comparing DNS names
      for equality, conforming implementations\n   MUST perform a case-insensitive
      exact match on the entire DNS name.\n   When evaluating name constraints, conforming
      implementations MUST\n   perform a case-insensitive exact match on a label-by-label
      basis.  As\n   noted in Section 4.2.1.10, any DNS name that may be constructed
      by\n   adding labels to the left-hand side of the domain name given as the\n
      \  constraint is considered to fall within the indicated subtree.\n   Implementations
      SHOULD convert IDNs to Unicode before display.\n   Specifically, conforming
      implementations convert A-labels to U-labels\n   for display.\n   Implementation
      consideration: There are increased memory requirements\n   for IDNs.  An IDN
      ACE label will begin with the four additional\n   characters \"xn--\", and an
      IDN can require as many as five ASCII\n   characters to specify a single international
      character.\n"

  - contents:
    - "2.4.  Update in IDNs in Distinguished Names (Section 7.3)\n   This update aligns
      with IDNA2008.\n   OLD\n   Domain Names may also be represented as distinguished
      names using\n   domain components in the subject field, the issuer field, the\n
      \  subjectAltName extension, or the issuerAltName extension.  As with\n   the
      dNSName in the GeneralName type, the value of this attribute is\n   defined
      as an IA5String.  Each domainComponent attribute represents a\n   single label.
      \ To represent a label from an IDN in the distinguished\n   name, the implementation
      MUST perform the \"ToASCII\" label conversion\n   specified in Section 4.1 of
      RFC 3490.  The label SHALL be considered\n   a \"stored string\".  That is,
      the AllowUnassigned flag SHALL NOT be\n   set.\n   NEW\n   Domain names may
      also be represented as distinguished names using\n   domain components in the
      subject field, the issuer field, the\n   subjectAltName extension, or the issuerAltName

      attribute is\n   defined as an IA5String.  Each domainComponent attribute represents
      a\n   single label.  To represent a label from an IDN in the distinguished\n
      \  name, the implementation MUST convert all U-labels to A-labels.\n"

    - "2.5.  Update in Internationalized Electronic Mail Addresses\n      (Section
      7.5)\n   This update aligns with IDNA2008 and RFC 8398 [RFC8398].  Since all\n
      \  of Section 7.5 is replaced, the OLD text is not provided.\n   NEW\n   Electronic
      Mail addresses may be included in certificates and CRLs in\n   the subjectAltName
      and issuerAltName extensions, name constraints\n   extension, authority information
      access extension, subject\n   information access extension, issuing distribution
      point extension,\n   or CRL distribution points extension.  Each of these extensions
      uses\n   the GeneralName construct.  If the email address includes an IDN but\n
      \  the local-part of the email address can be represented in ASCII, then\n   the
      email address is placed in the rfc822Name choice of GeneralName,\n   which is
      defined as type IA5String.  If the local-part of the\n   internationalized email
      address cannot be represented in ASCII, then\n   the internationalized email
      address is placed in the otherName choice\n   of GeneralName using the conventions
      in RFC 8398 [RFC8398].\n   7.5.1.  Local-Part Contains Only ASCII Characters\n
      \  Where the host-part contains an IDN, conforming implementations MUST\n   convert
      all U-labels to A-labels.\n   Two email addresses are considered to match if:\n
      \     1) the local-part of each name is an exact match, AND\n      2) the host-part
      of each name matches using a case-insensitive\n         ASCII comparison.\n
      \  Implementations SHOULD convert the host-part of internationalized\n   email
      addresses specified in these extensions to Unicode before\n   display.  Specifically,
      conforming implementations convert A-labels\n   to U-labels for display.\n   7.5.2.
      \ Local-Part Contains Non-ASCII Characters\n   When the local-part contains
      non-ASCII characters, conforming\n   implementations MUST place the internationalized
      email address in the\n   SmtpUTF8Mailbox within the otherName choice of GeneralName
      as\n   specified in Section 3 of RFC 8398 [RFC8398].  Note that the UTF8\n   encoding
      of the internationalized email address MUST NOT contain a\n   Byte-Order-Mark
      (BOM) [RFC3629] to aid comparison.\n   The comparison of two internationalized
      email addresses is specified\n   in Section 5 of RFC 8398 [RFC8398].\n   Implementations
      SHOULD convert the host-part of internationalized\n   email addresses specified
      in these extensions to Unicode before\n   display.  Specifically, conforming
