- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The functions of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) are\n\
    \   rapidly migrating to the Internet.  This is generating new\n   requirements\
    \ for many traditional elements of the PSTN, including\n   Telephone Numbers (TNs).\
    \  TNs no longer serve simply as telephone\n   routing addresses: they are now\
    \ identifiers that may be used by\n   Internet-based services for a variety of\
    \ purposes including session\n   establishment, identity verification, and service\
    \ enablement.  This\n   problem statement examines how the existing tools for\
    \ allocating and\n   managing telephone numbers do not align with the use cases\
    \ of the\n   Internet environment and proposes a framework for Internet-based\n\
    \   services relying on TNs.\n"

- title: 1.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "1.  Problem Statement\n   The challenges of utilizing Telephone Numbers (TNs)\
    \ on the Internet\n   have been known for some time.  Internet telephony provided\
    \ the first\n   use case for routing telephone numbers on the Internet in a manner\n\
    \   similar to how calls are routed in the Public Switched Telephone\n   Network\
    \ (PSTN).  As the Internet had no service for discovering the\n   endpoints associated\
    \ with telephone numbers, ENUM [RFC6116] created a\n   DNS-based mechanism for\
    \ translating TNs into URIs, as used by\n   protocols such as SIP [RFC3261]. \
    \ The resulting database was designed\n   to function in a manner similar to the\
    \ systems that route calls in\n   the PSTN.  Originally, it was envisioned that\
    \ ENUM would be deployed\n   as a global hierarchical service; however, in practice,\
    \ it has only\n   been deployed piecemeal by various parties.  Most notably, ENUM\
    \ is\n   used as an internal network function and is rarely used between\n   service\
    \ provider networks.  The original ENUM concept of a single\n   root, e164.arpa,\
    \ proved to be politically and practically\n   challenging, and less centralized\
    \ models have thus flourished.\n   Subsequently, the Data for Reachability of\
    \ Inter-/Intra-NetworK SIP\n   (DRINKS) framework [RFC6461] showed ways that service\
    \ providers might\n   provision information about TNs at an ENUM service or similar\n\
    \   Internet-based directory.  These technologies have also generally\n   tried\
    \ to preserve the features and architecture familiar to the PSTN\n   numbering\
    \ environment.\n   Over time, Internet telephony has encompassed functions that\
    \ differ\n   substantially from traditional PSTN routing and management,\n   especially\
    \ as non-traditional providers have begun to utilize\n   numbering resources.\
    \  An increasing number of enterprises, over-the-\n   top Voice over IP (VoIP)\
    \ providers, text messaging services, and\n   related non-carrier services have\
    \ become heavy users of telephone\n   numbers.  An enterprise, for example, can\
    \ deploy an IP Private Branch\n   Exchange (PBX) that receives a block of telephone\
    \ numbers from a\n   carrier and then, in turn, distributes those numbers to new\
    \ IP\n   telephones when they associate with the PBX.  Internet services offer\n\
    \   users portals where they can allocate new telephone numbers on the\n   fly,\
    \ assign multiple \"alias\" telephone numbers to a single line\n   service, implement\
    \ various mobility or find-me-follow-me\n   applications, and so on.  Peer-to-peer\
    \ telephone networks have\n   encouraged experiments with distributed databases\
    \ for telephone\n   number routing and even allocation.\n   This dynamic control\
    \ over telephone numbers has few precedents in the\n   traditional PSTN outside\
    \ of number portability.  Number portability\n   allows the capability of a user\
    \ to choose and change their service\n   provider while retaining their TN; it\
    \ has been implemented in many\n   countries either for all telephony services\
    \ or for subsets (e.g.,\n   mobile).  However, TN administration processes rooted\
    \ in PSTN\n   technology and policies made number porting fraught with problems\
    \ and\n   delays.  Originally, processes were built to associate a specific TN\n\
    \   to a specific service provider and never change it.  With number\n   portability,\
    \ the industry had to build new infrastructure and new\n   administrative functions\
    \ and processes to change the association of\n   the TN from one service provider\
    \ to another.  Thanks to the\n   increasing sophistication of consumer mobile\
    \ devices as Internet\n   endpoints as well as telephones, users now associate\
    \ TNs with many\n   Internet applications other than telephony.  This has generated\
    \ new\n   interest in models similar to those in place for administering\n   freephone\
    \ (non-geographic, toll-free numbers) services in the United\n   States, where\
    \ a user purchases a number through a sort of number\n   registrar and controls\
    \ its administration (such as routing) on their\n   own, typically using Internet\
    \ services to directly make changes to\n   the service associated with telephone\
    \ numbers.\n   Most TNs today are assigned to specific geographies, at both an\n\
    \   international level and within national numbering plans.  Numbering\n   practices\
    \ today are tightly coupled with the manner that service\n   providers interconnect\
    \ as well as with how TNs are routed and\n   administered: the PSTN was carefully\
    \ designed to delegate switching\n   intelligence geographically.  In interexchange\
    \ carrier routing in\n   North America, for example, calls to a particular TN\
    \ are often handed\n   off to the terminating service provider close to the geography\
    \ where\n   that TN is assigned.  But the overwhelming success of mobile\n   telephones\
    \ has increasingly eroded the connection between numbers and\n   regions.  Furthermore,\
    \ the topology of IP networks is not anchored to\n   geography in the same way\
    \ that the telephone network is.  In an\n   Internet environment, establishing\
    \ a network architecture for routing\n   TNs could depend little on geography,\
    \ relying instead on network\n   topologies or other architectural features. \
    \ Adapting TNs to the\n   Internet requires more security, richer datasets, and\
    \ more complex\n   query and response capabilities than previous efforts have\
    \ provided.\n   This document attempts to create a common understanding of the\n\
    \   problem statement related to allocating, managing, and resolving TNs\n   in\
    \ an IP environment, which is the focus of the IETF Managing,\n   Ordering, Distributing,\
    \ Exposing, and Registering telephone Numbers\n   (MODERN) Working Group.  It\
    \ outlines a framework and lists motivating\n   use cases for creating IP-based\
    \ mechanisms for TNs.  It is important\n   to acknowledge at the outset that there\
    \ are various evolving\n   international and national policies and processes related\
    \ to TNs, and\n   any solutions need to be flexible enough to account for variations\
    \ in\n   policy and requirements.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Actors
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Actors\n   The following roles of actors are defined in this document.\n\
    \   Numbering Authority:  A regulatory body within a region that manages\n   \
    \   that region's TNs.  The Numbering Authority decides national\n      numbering\
    \ policy for the nation, region, or other domain for which\n      it has authority,\
    \ including what TNs can be allocated, which are\n      reserved, and which entities\
    \ may obtain TNs.\n   Registry:  An entity that administers the allocation of\
    \ TNs based on\n      a Numbering Authority's policies.  Numbering Authorities\
    \ can act\n      as the Registries themselves, or they can outsource the function\n\
    \      to other entities.  Traditional registries are single entities\n      with\
    \ sole authority and responsibility for specific numbering\n      resources, though\
    \ distributed registries (see Section 2.3) are\n      also in the scope of this\
    \ framework.\n   Credential Authority:  An entity that distributes credentials,\
    \ such\n      as certificates that attest the authority of assignees (defined\n\
    \      below) and delegates.  This document assumes that one or more\n      Credential\
    \ Authorities may be trusted by actors in any given\n      regulatory environment;\
    \ policies for establishing such trust\n      anchors are outside the scope of\
    \ this document.\n   Registrar:  An entity that distributes the telephone numbers\n\
    \      administered by a Registry; typically, there are many Registrars\n    \
    \  that can distribute numbers from a single Registry, though\n      Registrars\
    \ may serve multiple Registries as well.  A Registrar has\n      business relationships\
    \ with number assignees and collects\n      administrative information from them.\n\
    \   Communication Service Provider (CSP):  A provider of communication\n     \
    \ service where those services can be identified by TNs.  This\n      includes\
    \ both traditional telephone carriers or enterprises as\n      well as service\
    \ providers with no presence on the PSTN who use\n      TNs.  This framework does\
    \ not assume that any single CSP provides\n      all the communication service\
    \ related to a particular TN.\n   Service Enabler:  An entity that works with\
    \ CSPs to enable\n      communication service to a User: perhaps a vendor, a service\n\
    \      bureau, or a third-party integrator.\n   User:  An individual reachable\
    \ through a communication service:\n      usually a customer of a Communication\
    \ Service Provider.\n   Government Entity:  An entity that, due to legal powers\
    \ deriving from\n      national policy, has privileged access to information about\
    \ number\n      administration under certain conditions.\n   Note that an individual,\
    \ organization, or other entity may act in one\n   or more of the roles above;\
    \ for example, a company may be a CSP and\n   also a Registrar.  Although Numbering\
    \ Authorities are listed as\n   actors, they are unlikely to actually participate\
    \ in the protocol\n   flows themselves; however, in some situations, a Numbering\
    \ Authority\n   and Registry may be the same administrative entity.\n   All actors\
    \ that are recipients of numbering resources, be they a CSP,\n   Service Enabler,\
    \ or User, can also be said to have a relationship to\n   a Registry of either\
    \ an assignee or delegate.\n   Assignee:  An actor that is assigned a TN directly\
    \ by a Registrar; an\n      assignee always has a direct relationship with a Registrar.\n\
    \   Delegate:  An actor that is delegated a TN from an assignee or\n      another\
    \ delegate who does not necessarily have a direct\n      relationship with a Registrar.\
    \  Delegates may delegate one or more\n      of their TN assignment(s) to one\
    \ or more subdelegates from further\n      downstream.\n   As an example, consider\
    \ a case where a Numbering Authority also acts\n   as a Registry, and it issues\
    \ blocks of 10,000 TNs to CSPs that, in\n   this case, also act as Registrars.\
    \  CSP/Registrars would then be\n   responsible for distributing numbering resources\
    \ to Users and other\n   CSPs.  In this case, an enterprise deploying IP PBXs\
    \ also acts as a\n   CSP, and it acquires number blocks for its enterprise seats\
    \ in chunks\n   of 100 from a CSP acting as a Registrar with whom the enterprise\
    \ has\n   a business relationship.  The enterprise is, in this case, the\n   assignee,\
    \ as it receives numbering resources directly from a\n   Registrar.  As it doles\
    \ out individual numbers to its Users, the\n   enterprise delegates its own numbering\
    \ resources to those Users and\n   their communication endpoints.  The overall\
    \ ecosystem might look as\n   follows.\n                 +---------+\n       \

- title: 2.2.  Data Types
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Data Types\n   The following data types are defined in this document.\n\
    \   Administrative Data:  Assignment data related to the TN and the\n      relevant\
    \ actors; it includes TN status (assigned, unassigned,\n      etc.), contact data\
    \ for the assignee or delegate, and typically\n      does not require real-time\
    \ access as this data is not required for\n      ordinary call or session establishment.\n\
    \   Service Data:  Data necessary to enable service for the TN; it\n      includes\
    \ addressing data and service features.  Since this data is\n      necessary to\
    \ complete calls, it must be obtained in real time.\n   Administrative and service\
    \ data can fit into three access categories:\n   Public:  Anyone can access public\
    \ data.  Such data might include a\n      list of which numbering resources (unallocated\
    \ number ranges) are\n      available for acquisition from the Registry.\n   Semi-restricted:\
    \  Only a subset of actors can access semi-restricted\n      data.  For example,\
    \ CSPs may be able to access other CSP's service\n      data in some closed environment.\n\
    \   Restricted:  Only a small subset of actors can access restricted\n      data.\
    \  For example, a Government Entity may be able access contact\n      information\
    \ for a User.\n   While it might appear there are really only two categories,\
    \ public\n   and restricted (based on the requestor), the distinction between\n\
    \   semi-restricted and restricted is helpful for the use cases below.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Data Management Architectures
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Data Management Architectures\n   This framework generally assumes that\
    \ administrative and service data\n   is maintained by CSPs, Registrars, and Registries.\
    \  The terms\n   \"registrar\" and \"registry\" are familiar from DNS operations,\
    \ and\n   indeed the DNS provides an obvious inspiration for the relationships\n\
    \   between those entities described here.  Protocols for transferring\n   names\
    \ between registries and registrars have been standardized in the\n   DNS space\
    \ for some time (see [RFC3375]).  Similarly, the division\n   between service\
    \ data acquired by resolving names with the DNS\n   protocol versus administrative\
    \ data about names acquired through\n   WHOIS [RFC3912] is directly analogous\
    \ to the distinction between\n   service and administrative data described in\
    \ Section 2.2.  The major\n   difference between the data management architecture\
    \ of the DNS and\n   this framework is that the distinction between the CSP and\
    \ User, due\n   to historical policies of the telephone network, will often not\n\
    \   exactly correspond to the distinction between a name service and a\n   registrant\
    \ in the DNS world -- a User in the telephone network is\n   today at least rarely\
    \ in a direct relationship with a Registrar\n   comparable to that of a DNS registrant.\n\
    \   The role of a Registry described here is a \"thin\" one, where the\n   Registry\
    \ manages basic allocation information for the numbering\n   space, such as information\
    \ about whether or not the number is\n   assigned, and if assigned, by which Registrar.\
    \  It is the Registrar\n   that, in turn, manages detailed administrative data\
    \ about those\n   assignments, such as contact or billing information for the\
    \ assignee.\n   In some models, CSPs and Registrars will be combined (the same\n\
    \   administrative entity), and in others the Registry and Registrar may\n   similarly\
    \ be composed.  Typically, service data resides largely at\n   the CSP itself,\
    \ though in some models a \"thicker\" Registry may itself\n   contain a pointer\
    \ to the servicing CSP for a number or number block.\n   In addition to traditional\
    \ centralized Registries, this framework\n   also supports environments where\
    \ the same data is being managed by\n   multiple administrative entities and stored\
    \ in many locations.  A\n   distributed registry system is discussed further in\
    \ [DRIP].  To\n   support those use cases, it is important to distinguish the\n\
    \   following:\n   Data Store:  A data store is a service that stores and enables\
    \ access\n      to administrative and/or service data.\n   Reference Address:\
    \  A reference address is a URL that dereferences to\n      the location of the\
    \ data store.\n   Distributed Data Stores:  In a distributed data store, administrative\n\
    \      or service data can be stored with multiple actors.  For example,\n   \
    \   CSPs could provision their service data to multiple other CSPs.\n   Distributed\
    \ Registries:  Multiple Registries can manage the same\n      numbering resource.\
    \  In these architectures, actors could interact\n      with one or multiple Registries.\
    \  The Registries would update each\n      other when change occurs.  The Registries\
    \ have to ensure that data\n      remains consistent, e.g., that the same TN is\
    \ not assigned to two\n      different actors.\n"
- title: 3.  Framework
  contents:
  - "3.  Framework\n   The framework outlined in this document requires three Internet-based\n\
    \   mechanisms for managing and resolving TNs in an IP environment.\n   These\
    \ mechanisms will likely reuse existing protocols for sharing\n   structured data;\
    \ it is unlikely that new protocol development work\n   will be required, though\
    \ new information models specific to the data\n   itself will be a major focus\
    \ of framework development.  Likely\n   candidates for reuse here include work\
    \ done in DRINKS [RFC6461] and\n   Web Extensible Internet Registration Data Service\
    \ (WEIRDS) [RFC7482],\n   as well as the Telephone-Related Information (TeRI)\
    \ framework\n   [TERI-INFO].\n   These protocol mechanisms are scoped in a way\
    \ that makes them likely\n   to apply to a broad range of future policies for\
    \ number\n   administration.  It is not the purpose of this framework to dictate\n\
    \   number policy but instead to provide tools that will work with\n   policies\
    \ as they evolve going forward.  These mechanisms, therefore,\n   do not assume\
    \ that number administration is centralized nor that\n   number allocations are\
    \ restricted to any category of service\n   providers, though these tools must\
    \ and will work in environments with\n   those properties.\n   The three mechanisms\
    \ are:\n   Acquisition:  A protocol mechanism for acquiring TNs, including an\n\
    \      enrollment process.\n   Management:  A protocol mechanism for associating\
    \ data with TNs.\n   Retrieval:  A protocol mechanism for retrieving data about\
    \ TNs.\n   The acquisition mechanism will enable actors to acquire TNs for use\n\
    \   with a communication service by requesting numbering resources from a\n  \
    \ service operated by a Registrar, CSP, or similar actor.  TNs may be\n   requested\
    \ either on a number-by-number basis or as inventory blocks.\n   Any actor who\
    \ grants numbering resources will retain metadata about\n   the assignment, including\
    \ the responsible organization or individual\n   to whom numbers have been assigned.\n\
    \   The management mechanism will let actors provision data associated\n   with\
    \ TNs.  For example, if a User has been assigned a TN, they may\n   select a CSP\
    \ to provide a particular service associated with the TN,\n   or a CSP may assign\
    \ a TN to a User upon service activation.  In\n   either case, a mechanism is\
    \ needed to provision data associated with\n   the TN at that CSP and to extend\
    \ those data sets as CSPs (and even\n   Users) require.\n   The retrieval mechanism\
    \ will enable actors to learn information about\n   TNs.  For real-time service\
    \ data, this typically involves sending a\n   request to a CSP; for other information,\
    \ an actor may need to send a\n   request to a Registry rather than a CSP.  Different\
    \ parties may be\n   authorized to receive different information about TNs.\n\
    \   As an example, a CSP might use the acquisition interface to acquire a\n  \
    \ chunk of numbers from a Registrar.  Users might then provision\n   administrative\
    \ data associated with those numbers at the CSP through\n   the management interface\
    \ and query for service data relating to those\n   numbers through the retrieval\

    \ to distribute the numbers that the\n   Registries administer.  In these use\
    \ cases, a User may acquire TNs\n   either from a CSP, a Registry, or an intermediate\
    \ delegate.\n"
- title: 4.1.1.  Acquiring TNs from Registrar
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  Acquiring TNs from Registrar\n   The most traditional number acquisition\
    \ use case is one where a CSP,\n   such as a carrier, requests a block of numbers\
    \ from a Registrar to\n   hold as inventory or assign to customers.\n   Through\
    \ some out-of-band business process, a CSP develops a\n   relationship with a\
    \ Registrar.  The Registrar maintains a profile of\n   the CSP and assesses whether\
    \ or not CSPs meet the policy restrictions\n   for acquiring TNs.  The CSP may\
    \ then request TNs from within a\n   specific pool of numbers in the authority\
    \ of the Registry, such as\n   region, mobile, wireline, or freephone.  The Registrar\
    \ must\n   authenticate and authorize the CSP and then either grant or deny a\n\
    \   request.  When an assignment occurs, the Registry creates and stores\n   administrative\
    \ information related to the assignment, such as TN\n   status and Registrar contact\
    \ information, and removes the specific\n   TN(s) from the pool of those that\
    \ are available for assignment.  As a\n   part of the acquisition and assignment\
    \ process, the Registry provides\n   to the Registrar any tokens or other material\
    \ needed by a Credential\n   Authority to issue credentials (for example, Secure\
    \ Telephone\n   Identity Revisited (STIR) certificates [RFC8226]) used to attest\
    \ the\n   assignment for future transactions.  Depending on the policies of the\n\
    \   Numbering Authorities, Registrars may be required to log these\n   operations.\n\
    \   Before it is eligible to receive TN assignments, per the policy of a\n   Numbering\
    \ Authority, the CSP may need to have submitted (again,\n   through some out-of-band\
    \ process) additional qualifying information\n   such as the current utilization\
    \ rate or a demand forecast.\n   There are two scenarios under which a CSP requests\
    \ resources: either\n   they are requesting inventory or they are requesting for\
    \ a specific\n   User or delegate.  For the purpose of status information, TNs\n\
    \   assigned to a User are always considered assigned, not inventory.\n   The\
    \ CSP will associate service information for that TN (e.g., a\n   service address)\
    \ and make it available to other CSPs to enable\n   interconnection.  The CSP\
    \ may need to update the Registrar regarding\n   this service activation; this\
    \ is part of the \"TN status\" maintained\n   by the Registrar.\n   There are\
    \ also use cases in which a User can acquire a TN directly\n   from a Registrar.\
    \  Today, a User wishing to acquire a freephone\n   number may browse the existing\
    \ inventory through one or more\n   Registrars, comparing their prices and services.\
    \  Each such Registrar\n   either is a CSP or has a business relationship with\
    \ one or more CSPs\n   to provide services for that freephone number.  In this\
    \ case, the\n   User must establish some business relationship directly with a\n\
    \   Registrar, similar to how such functions are conducted today when\n   Users\
    \ purchase domain names.  In this use case, after receiving a\n   number assignment\
    \ from the Registrar, a User will obtain\n   communication service from a CSP\
    \ and provide to the CSP the TN to be\n   used for that service.  The CSP will\
    \ associate service information\n   for that TN (e.g., the service address) and\
    \ make it available to\n   other CSPs to enable interconnection.  The User will\
    \ also need to\n   inform the Registrar about this relationship.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.  Acquiring TNs from CSPs
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  Acquiring TNs from CSPs\n   Today, a User typically acquires a TN from\
    \ a CSP when signing up for\n   a communication service or turning on a new device.\
    \  In this use\n   case, the User becomes the delegate of the CSP.  A reseller\
    \ or a\n   service bureau might also acquire a block of numbers from a CSP to\
    \ be\n   issued to Users.\n   Consider a case where a User creates or has a relationship\
    \ with the\n   CSP and subscribes to a communication service that includes the\
    \ use\n   of a TN.  The CSP collects and stores administrative data about the\n\
    \   User.  The CSP then activates the User on their network and creates\n   any\
    \ necessary service data to enable connectivity with other CSPs.\n   The CSP could\
    \ also update public or privileged databases accessible\n   by other actors. \
    \ The CSP provides any tokens or other material\n   needed by a Credential Authority\
    \ to issue credentials to the User\n   (for example, a STIR certificate [RFC8226])\
    \ to prove the assignment\n   for future transactions.  Such credentials could\
    \ be delegated from\n   the one provided by the Credential Authority to the CSP\
    \ to continue\n   the chain of assignment.  CSPs may be required to log such\n\
    \   transactions if required by the policy of the Numbering Authority.\n   Virtually,\
    \ the same flow would work for a reseller: it would form a\n   business relationship\
    \ with the CSP, at which point the CSP would\n   collect and store administrative\
    \ data about the reseller and give the\n   reseller any material needed for the\
    \ reseller to acquire credentials\n   for the numbers.  A User might then, in\
    \ turn, acquire numbers from\n   the reseller: in this case, the delegate redelegating\
    \ the TNs would\n   be performing functions done by the CSP (e.g., providing any\n\
    \   credentials or collecting administrative data or creative service\n   data).\n\
    \   The CSP could assign a TN from its existing inventory or it could\n   acquire\
    \ a new TN from the Registrar as part of the assignment\n   process.  If it assigns\
    \ it from its existing inventory, it would\n   remove the specific TN from the\
    \ pool of those available for\n   assignment.  It may also update the Registrar\
    \ about the assignment so\n   the Registrar has current assignment data.  If a\
    \ reseller or delegate\n   CSP is acquiring the numbers, it may have the same\
    \ obligations to\n   provide utilization data to the Registry as the assignee,\
    \ per\n   Section 4.1.1.\n"

- title: 4.2.1.1.  Managing Data at a Registrar
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.1.  Managing Data at a Registrar\n   After a CSP acquires a TN or block\
    \ of TNs from the Registrar (per\n   Section 4.1.1), it then provides administrative\
    \ data to the Registrar\n   as a step in the acquisition process.  The Registrar\
    \ will\n   authenticate the CSP and determine if the CSP is authorized to\n  \
    \ provision the administrative data for the TNs in question.  The\n   Registry\
    \ will update the status of the TN, i.e., that it is\n   unavailable for assignment.\
    \  The Registrar will also maintain\n   administrative data provided by the CSP.\n\
    \   Changes to this administrative data will not be frequent.  Examples\n   of\
    \ changes would be terminating service (see Section 4.2.3.2),\n   changing the\
    \ name or address of a User or organization, or changing a\n   CSP or delegate.\
    \  Changes should be authenticated by a credential to\n   prove administrative\
    \ responsibility for the TN.\n   In some cases, such as the freephone system in\
    \ North America today,\n   the User has a direct relationship with the Registrar.\
    \  Naturally,\n   these Users could provision administrative data associated with\
    \ their\n   TNs directly to the Registrar just as a freephone provider today\n\
    \   maintains account and billing data.  While delegates may not\n   ordinarily\
    \ have a direct relationship to a Registrar, some\n   environments (as an optimization)\
    \ might want to support a model where\n   the delegate updates the Registrar directly\
    \ on changes, as opposed to\n   sending that data to the CSP or through the CSP\
    \ to the Registrar.  As\n   stated already, the protocol should enable Users to\
    \ acquire TNs\n   directly from a Registrar, which may or may not also act as\
    \ a CSP.\n   In these cases, the updates would be similar to those described in\n\
    \   Section 4.2.1.1.\n   In a distributed Registry model, TN status (e.g., allocated,\n\
    \   assigned, available, or unavailable) would need to be provided to\n   other\
    \ Registries in real time.  Other administrative data could be\n   sent to all\
    \ Registries, or other Registries could get a reference\n   address to the host\

    \   they are willing to share them with other CSPs for troubleshooting\n   purposes,\
    \ but not to make them available to general communication.\n   Alternatively,\
    \ that information could be part of a distributed data\n   store and not stored\
    \ at a monolithic Registry.  In that case, the CSP\n   has the data in a local\
    \ distributed data store, and it initiates the\n   query to the local data store.\
    \  The local data store responds with\n   the CSP and contact data.  No verification\
    \ is necessary because it\n   was done when the CSP was authorized to receive\
    \ the data store.\n"

  - "4.3.3.  Retrieval of Semi-restricted Service Data\n   Consider a case where a\
    \ User on a CSP's network calls a TN.  The CSP\n   initiates a query for service\
    \ data associated with the TN to complete\n   the call and will receive special\
    \ service data because the CSP\n   operates in a closed environment where different\
    \ CSPs receive\n   different responses, and only participating CSPs can initiate\n\
    \   communication.  This service data would be flagged as semi-\n   restricted.\
    \  The query and response have real-time performance\n   requirements in that\
    \ environment.\n   Semi-restricted service data also works in a distributed data\
    \ store\n   model where each CSP distributes its updated service data to all\n\
    \   other CSPs.  The originating CSP has the service data in its local\n   data\
    \ store and queries it.  The local data store responds with the\n   service data.\
    \  The service data in the response can be a reference\n   address to a data store\
    \ maintained by the serving CSP or it can be\n   the service address itself. \
    \ In the case where the response gives a\n   reference address, a subsequent query\
    \ would go to the serving CSP,\n   who would, in turn, authorize the requestor\
    \ for the requested data\n   and respond appropriately.  In the case, where the\
    \ original response\n   contains the service address, the requestor would use\
    \ that service\n   address as the destination for the call.\n   In some environments,\
    \ aspects of the service data may reside at the\n   Registry itself (for example,\
    \ the assigned CSP for a TN); thus, the\n   query may be sent to the Registry.\
    \  The Registry verifies the\n   requestor and the requested data and responds\
    \ with the service data,\n   such as a SIP URI containing the domain of the assigned\
    \ CSP.\n"

  - "4.3.4.  Retrieval of Restricted Data\n   A Government Entity wishes to access\
    \ information about a particular\n   User who subscribes to a communication service.\
    \  The entity that\n   operates the Registry on behalf of the Numbering Authority\
    \ in this\n   case has some predefined relationship with the Government Entity.\n\
    \   When the CSP acquired TNs from the Numbering Authority, it was a\n   condition\

    \ (or itself, if the CSP is composed with\n   a Registrar) with information relevant\

  - "6.  Privacy Considerations\n   This framework defines two categories of information\
    \ about telephone\n   numbers: service data and administrative data.  Service\
    \ data\n   describes how telephone numbers map to particular services and\n  \
    \ devices that provide real-time communication for users.  As such,\n   service\
    \ data could potentially leak resource locations and even\n   lower-layer network\
    \ addresses associated with these services, and in\n   rare cases, with end-user\
    \ devices.  Administrative data more broadly\n   characterizes who the administrative\
    \ entities are behind telephone\n   numbers, which will often identify CSPs but\
    \ some layers of the\n   architecture could include Personally Identifiable Information\
    \ (PII),\n   even WHOIS-style information, about the end users behind identifiers.\n\
    \   This could conceivably encompass the sorts of data that carriers and\n   similar\
    \ CSPs today keep about their customers for billing purposes,\n   like real names\
    \ and postal addresses.  The exact nature of\n   administrative data is not defined\
    \ by this framework, and it is\n   anticipated that the protocols that will perform\
    \ this function will\n   be extensible for different use cases, so at this point,\
    \ it is\n   difficult to characterize exactly how much PII might end up being\n\
    \   housed by these services.\n   As such, if an attacker were to compromise the\
    \ registrar services\n   that maintains administrative data in this architecture,\
    \ and in some\n   cases even service data, this could leak PII about end users.\
    \  These\n   interfaces, and the systems that host them, are a potentially\n \
    \  attractive target for hackers and need to be hardened accordingly.\n   Protocols\
    \ that are selected to fulfill these functions must provide\n   the security features\
    \ described in Section 7.\n   Finally, this framework recognizes that, in many\
    \ jurisdictions,\n   certain government agencies have a legal right to access\
    \ service and\n   administrative data maintained by CSPs.  This access is typically\n\
    \   aimed at identifying the users behind the communication identifier in\n  \
    \ order to enforce regulatory policy.  Those legal entities already\n   have the\
    \ power to access the existing data held by CSPs in many\n   jurisdictions, though,\
    \ potentially, the administrative data\n   associated with this framework could\
    \ be richer information.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The acquisition, management, and retrieval of\
    \ administrative and\n   service data associated with telephone numbers raises\
    \ a number of\n   security issues.\n   Any mechanism that allows an individual\
    \ or organization to acquire\n   telephone numbers will require a means of mutual\
    \ authentication, of\n   integrity protection, and of confidentiality.  A Registry\
    \ as defined\n   in this document will surely want to authenticate the source\
    \ of an\n   acquisition request as a first step in the authorization process to\n\
    \   determine whether or not the resource will be granted.  Integrity of\n   both\
    \ the request and response is essential to ensuring that tampering\n   does not\
    \ allow attackers to block acquisitions, or worse, to\n   commandeer resources.\
    \  Confidentiality is essential to preventing\n   eavesdroppers from learning\
    \ about allocations, including the\n   personally identifying information associated\
    \ with the administrative\n   or technical contracts for allocations.\n   A management\
    \ interface for telephone numbers has similar\n   requirements.  Without proper\
    \ authentication and authorization\n   mechanisms in place, an attack could use\
    \ the management interface to\n   disrupt service data or administrative data,\
    \ which could deny service\n   to users, enable new impersonation attacks, prevent\
    \ billing systems\n   from operating properly, and cause similar system failures.\n\
    \   Finally, a retrieval interface has its own needs for mutual\n   authentication,\
    \ integrity protection, and confidentiality.  Any CSP\n   sending a request to\
    \ retrieve service data associated with a number\n   will want to know that it\
    \ is reaching the proper authority, that the\n   response from that authority\
    \ has not been tampered with in transit,\n   and, in most cases, the CSP will\
    \ not want to reveal to eavesdroppers\n   the number it is requesting or the response\
    \ that it has received.\n   Similarly, any service answering such a query will\
    \ want to have a\n   means of authenticating the source of the query and of protecting\
    \ the\n   integrity and confidentiality of its responses.\n"
