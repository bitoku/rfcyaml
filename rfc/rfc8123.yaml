- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   SIP networks use signaling monitoring tools to debug customer-\n\
    \   reported problems and for regression testing if network or client\n   software\
    \ is upgraded.  As networks grow and become interconnected,\n   including connection\
    \ via transit networks, it becomes impractical to\n   predict the path that SIP\
    \ signaling will take between clients and,\n   therefore, impractical to monitor\
    \ SIP signaling end-to-end.\n   This document describes the requirements for adding\
    \ an indicator to\n   the SIP Protocol Data Unit (PDU) or a SIP message that marks\
    \ the PDU\n   as a candidate for logging.  Such a marking will typically be applied\n\
    \   as part of network testing controlled by the network operator and not\n  \
    \ used in regular client signaling.  However, such a marking can be\n   carried\
    \ end-to-end, including the SIP terminals, even if a session\n   originates and\
    \ terminates in different networks.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Service providers, enterprises, and others who operate networks\
    \ that\n   use SIP (see [RFC3261]) need the ability to debug problems reported\n\
    \   by end users and also to run regression tests if SIP client software/\n  \
    \ hardware is upgraded.  Such debugging and testing might be confined\n   to a\
    \ single service provider or network, or they may occur between\n   the administrative\
    \ domains of different network operators, including\n   domains in different countries\
    \ that are interconnected through\n   networks belonging to one or more third\
    \ parties.\n   A mechanism is needed to mark particular SIP sessions, i.e., those\n\
    \   related to debugging or regression testing, as candidates for\n   logging;\
    \ this marking must be carried within the candidate SIP\n   messages as they are\
    \ routed across networks (and geographies) to\n   enable logging at each SIP entity\
    \ without having to know in advance\n   the list of SIP entities through which\
    \ the SIP signaling messages\n   will traverse.  Such marking must take into account\
    \ that SIP messages\n   might traverse different network operators, different\
    \ countries,\n   regions with different privacy requirements, and different trust\n\
    \   domains.  This document describes the requirements for such a \"log\n   me\"\
    \ marker for SIP signaling.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Network Boundary
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Network Boundary\n   A network boundary is the part of a signaling path\
    \ where messages\n   pass between entities that are under different administrative\n\
    \   control.  Figure 2 in [RFC5853] shows a network boundary between the\n   originating\
    \ gateway GW-A1 in operator A's network and the Session\n   Border Controller\
    \ (SBC) in operator B's network.  A network boundary\n   is significant in this\
    \ document because manipulation of signaling at\n   the boundary could prevent\
    \ end-to-end testing or troubleshooting.\n   Topology hiding and protocol repair\
    \ (see [RFC5853]) are two common\n   functions that manipulate signaling at the\
    \ network boundary.  These\n   functions are performed by SIP device types (see\
    \ [RFC7092]) such as a\n   Session Border Controller and Interconnection Border\
    \ Control Function\n   (IBCF).\n"
- title: 3.2.  Trust Domain
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Trust Domain\n   In this document, a trust domain is the set of entities\
    \ that have\n   been identified by prior agreement as the participating elements\
    \ in\n   logging, typically for the purpose of debugging or regression\n   testing.\
    \  A trust domain contains all SIP entities under\n   configuration control of\
    \ the network operator who is performing\n   regression testing plus all SIP entities\
    \ that are under configuration\n   control of peer network operators who have\
    \ agreed to participate in\n   that regression testing.  The purpose of trust\
    \ domain requirements is\n   to prevent network operators from inadvertently triggering\
    \ logging in\n   networks that are not part of any testing or troubleshooting.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Introduction\n   Signaling for SIP session setup can cross several networks;\
    \ these\n   networks may not have common ownership and may also be in different\n\
    \   countries.  If a single operator wishes to perform regression testing\n  \
    \ or fault debugging end-to-end, the separate ownership of networks\n   that carry\
    \ the signaling and the explosion in the number of possible\n   signaling paths\
    \ through SIP entities from the originating to the\n   terminating user make it\
    \ impractical to preconfigure logging end-to-\n   end SIP signaling of a session\
    \ of interest.\n"

    log me\" marker into SIP requests\n      for session setup.\n   o  All SIP entities\

    \  For some scenarios, such as call\n      transfer, related dialogs may also\
    \ be marked with \"log me\" marker.\n   o  Logging stops, either because the dialog\

- title: 5.3.  Processing the "Log Me" Marker
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Processing the \"Log Me\" Marker\n   REQ6:  A \"log me\" marker is most\
    \ effective if all networks on the\n          signaling path agree to pass it\
    \ end-to-end.  However, source\n          networks should behave responsibly and\
    \ not leave it to a\n          downstream network to detect and remove a marker\
    \ that it is\n          not expecting.\n   REQ7:  The presence of a \"log me\"\
    \ marker indicates that a request or\n          response is part of debugging\
    \ or regression testing.\n   REQ8:  It MUST be possible to insert a \"log me\"\
    \ marker in SIP\n          responses that correspond to SIP requests with a \"\
    log me\"\n          marker in order to ensure that the complete SIP transaction\
    \ is\n          logged.  This requirement applies to endpoints, SIP/Public\n \
    \         Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) gateways, and back-to-back\n     \
    \     user agents (B2BUAs).\n   REQ9:  The \"log me\" marker mechanism SHOULD\
    \ allow a SIP intermediary\n          to request logging SIP requests and responses\
    \ on behalf of the\n          originating endpoint.  The typical use case for\
    \ this\n          requirement is for compatibility with User Agents (UAs) that\n\
    \          have not implemented \"log me\" marking, i.e., when a UA has not\n\
    \          marked a request or when responses received on a dialog of\n      \
    \    interest for logging do not contain an echoed \"log me\" marker.\n      \
    \    Another use case is when the session origination UA that\n          inserted\
    \ the \"log me\" marker is no longer participating in the\n          session (e.g.,\
    \ call transfer scenarios) and the intermediary\n          adds a \"log me\" marker\
    \ in related sessions to enable end-to-\n          end signaling analysis.\n \
    \  REQ10: The mechanism MUST allow stateless processing of SIP requests\n    \
    \      that contain a \"log me\" marker by SIP intermediaries.  This\n       \
    \   requirement enables the SIP intermediaries to base the\n          decision\
    \ to log a SIP request or response solely on the\n          presence of the \"\
    log me\" marker.\n   REQ11: The scope of a SIP message logging request includes\
    \ all\n          requests and responses within a given dialog.  The scope can\n\
    \          be extended to related dialogs that correspond to an end-to-\n    \
    \      end session for scenarios discussed in REQ9.  The \"log me\"\n        \
    \  request MUST be indicated at the beginning of the dialog of\n          interest\
    \ and SHOULD continue to the dialog end without any\n          stop and restart\
    \ during the duration of the dialog.\n   REQ12: The presence of a \"log me\" marker\
    \ might cause some SIP\n          entities to log signaling.  Therefore, this\
    \ marker MUST be\n          removed at the earliest opportunity if it has been\
    \ incorrectly\n          inserted (e.g., mid-dialog or outside the configured\
    \ start and\n          stop of \"log me\" marking).\n   The definition of types\
    \ of events that cause logging to stop and the\n   configuration of SIP entities\
    \ to detect such \"stop events\" is outside\n   the scope of this document.\n"
