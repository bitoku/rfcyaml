  contents:
  - "1.  Labeling Requirements\n   The U.S. Congress and President have enacted the\
    \ Controlling the\n   Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of\
    \ 2003\n   (CAN-SPAM Act of 2003) [US], which requires in Section 11(2) that the\n\
    \   Federal Trade Commission:\n      \"[transmit to the Congress] a report, within\
    \ 18 months after the\n      date of enactment of this Act, that sets forth a\
    \ plan for\n      requiring commercial electronic mail to be identifiable from\
    \ its\n      subject line, by means of compliance with Internet Engineering\n\
    \      Task Force Standards, the use of the characters \"ADV\" in the\n      subject\
    \ line, or other comparable identifier, or an explanation of\n      any concerns\
    \ the Commission has that cause the Commission to\n      recommend against this\
    \ plan.\"\n   The Korean Government has enacted the Act on Promotion of Information\n\
    \   and Communication and Communications Network Utilization and\n   Information\
    \ Protection of 2001 [Korea].  As explained by the Korea\n   Information Security\
    \ Agency, the government body with enforcement\n   authority under the act, Korean\
    \ law makes it mandatory as of June,\n   2003 to:\n      \"include the '@' (at)\

    \ in addition to the words\n      '(Advertisement)' or '(Adult Advertisement)'\
    \ as applicable.  The\n      inclusion of the '@' symbol, as proposed by the Korean\
    \ government,\n      is intended to indicate an e-mail advertisement.  Because\
    \ e-mails\n      easily cross international borders, the '@' symbol may be used\
    \ as\n      a symbol for filtering advertisement mails.\" [KISA]\n   The State\
    \ of Colorado has enacted the Colorado Junk Email Law, which\n   states:\n   \
    \   \"It shall be a violation of this article for any person that sends\n    \
    \  an unsolicited commercial electronic mail message to fail to use\n      the\
    \ exact characters \"ADV:\" (the capital letters \"A\", \"D\", and\n      \"V\"\

- title: 2.  Subject Line Encoding
  contents:
  - "2.  Subject Line Encoding\n   The basic definition of the \"Subject:\" of an\
    \ electronic mail message\n   is contained in [RFC2822].  The normative requirements\
    \ that apply to\n   all headers are:\n   o  The maximum length of the header field\
    \ is 998 characters.\n   o  Each line must be no longer than 78 characters.\n\
    \   A multi-line subject field is indicated by the presence of a carriage\n  \
    \ return and white space, as follows:\n        Subject: This\n         is a test\n\
    \   On the subject of the three unstructured fields ( \"Subject:\",\n   \"Comments:\"\
    , and \"Keywords:\"), the standard indicates that these are\n   \"intended to\
    \ have only human-readable content with information about\n   the message.\" \
    \ In addition, on the specific subject of the \"Subject:\"\n   field, the standard\
    \ states:\n      The \"Subject:\" field is the most common and contains a short\n\
    \      string identifying the topic of the message.  When used in a\n      reply,\
    \ the field body MAY start with the string \"Re: \" (from the\n      Latin \"\
    res\", in the matter of) followed by the contents of the\n      \"Subject:\" field\
    \ body of the original message.  If this is done,\n      only one instance of\
    \ the literal string \"Re: \" ought to be used\n      since use of other strings\
    \ or more than one instance can lead to\n      undesirable consequences.\n   Further\
    \ guidance on the structure of the \"Subject:\" field is\n   contained in [RFC2047],\
    \ which species the mechanisms for character\n   set encoding in mail headers.\
    \  [RFC2978] specifies a mechanism for\n   registering different character sets\
    \ with the [IANA].\n   In addition to choosing a character set, [RFC2047] uses\
    \ two\n   algorithms, known as \"Base64 Encoding\" and \"Quoted Printable\", which\n\
    \   are two different methods for encoding characters that fall outside\n   the\
    \ basic 7-bit ASCII requirements that are specified in the core\n   electronic\
    \ mail standards.\n   Thus, an encoded piece of text consists of the following\
    \ components:\n   o  The string \"=?\", which signifies the beginning of encoded\
    \ text.\n   o  A valid character set indicator.\n   o  The string \"?\", which\
    \ is a delimiter.\n   o  The string \"b\" if \"Base64 Encoding\" is used or the\
    \ string \"q\" if\n      \"Quoted Printable\" encoding is used.\n   o  The string\
    \ \"?\", which is a delimiter.\n   o  The text, which has been properly encoded.\n\
    \   o  The string \"?=\", which signifies the ending of the encoded text.\n  \
    \ A simple example would be to use the popular [8859-1] character set,\n   which\
    \ has accents and other characters not found in the ASCII\n   character set:\n\
    \   o  \"Subject: This is an ADV:\" is an unencoded header.\n   o  \"Subject:\
    \ =?iso-8859-1?b?VGhpcyBpcyBhbiBBRFY6?=\" is encoded using\n      Base64.\n  \
    \ o  \"Subject: =?iso-8859-1?q?This=20is=20an=20ADV:?=\" is encoded using\n  \
    \    Quoted Printable.\n   o  \"Subject: =?iso-8859-1?q?This=20is=20an=20=41=44=56=3A?=\"\
    \ is also\n      encoded using Quoted Printable, but instead the last four\n \
    \     characters are encoded with their hexadecimal representations.\n   Note\
    \ that both character set and encoding indicators are case\n   insensitive.  Additional\
    \ complexity can be introduced by appending a\n   language specification to the\
    \ character set indication, as specified\n   in [RFC2231] and [RFC3066].  This\
    \ language specification consists of\n   the string \"*\", followed by a valid\
    \ language indicator.  For example,\n   \"US-ASCII*EN\" indicates the \"US-ASCII\"\
    \ character set and the English\n   language.\n   When a message is read, the\
    \ \"Subject:\" field is decoded, with\n   appropriate characters from the character\
    \ set displayed to the user.\n   Section 7 (Conformance) of [RFC2047] specifies\
    \ that a conforming mail\n   reading program must perform the following tasks:\n\
    \      \"The program must be able to display the unencoded text if the\n     \
    \ character set is \"US-ASCII\".  For the ISO-8859-* character sets,\n      the\
    \ mail reading program must at least be able to display the\n      characters\
    \ which are also in the ASCII set.\"\n   However, there is no requirement for\
    \ every system to have every\n   character set.  Mail readers that are unable\
    \ to display a particular\n   set of characters resort to a variety of strategies,\
    \ including\n   silently ignoring the unknown text, or generating an error or\
    \ warning\n   message.\n   Two characteristics of many common Message User Agents\
    \ (MUAs) (e.g.,\n   mail readers) are worth noting:\n   o  Although the subject\
    \ line is, in theory, of unlimited length, many\n      mail readers only show\
    \ the reader the first few dozen characters.\n   o  Electronic mail is often transmitted\
    \ through gateways, reaching\n      pagers or cell phones with SMS capability.\
    \  Those systems\n      typically require short subject lines.\n"
- title: 3.  Implementing a Labeling Requirement
  contents:
  - "3.  Implementing a Labeling Requirement\n   In this section, we posit a hypothetical\
    \ situation with two key\n   players:\n   o  John Doe [Doe] is an attorney at\
    \ the firm of Dewey, Cheatem &\n      Howe, LLC [Stooges].\n   o  The Federal\
    \ Trust Commission (FTC) has been entrusted with\n      implementing a recent\
    \ labeling requirement, promulgated by the\n      Sovereign Government of Freedonia\
    \ [Duck].  Specifically, President\n      Firefly directed the FTC to \"make sure\
    \ that anybody spamming folks\n      get the symbol 'spam:' in the subject line\
    \ and or shoot them, if\n      you can find them.\"\n   Based on this directive,\
    \ the FTC promulgated a very simple regulation\n   which read: \"Please obey the\
    \ law.\"  John Doe, being a lawyer, read\n   the law, and promptly proceeded to\
    \ spam everybody using a fairly\n   obvious loophole: he made sure his subject\
    \ line was really long, and\n   he shoved all the stuff like \"spam:\" and the\
    \ \"@\" symbol and other\n   verbiage near the end of the 998 allowed characters.\
    \  He was\n   complying with the law, but of course, nobody saw the labels in\
    \ their\n   reader.\n   Based on a periodic review, the FTC decided to be more\
    \ specific, and\n   re-promulgated their regulation as follows: \"If you send\
    \ spam, put\n   'spam:' at the _beginning_ of the subject line.\"  The Freedonian\
    \ FTC\n   promptly received a visit from the Sylvanian Ambassador, who\n   complained\
    \ that this conflicted with his country's requirements under\n   the Marx Doctrine\
    \ to place the string \"WATCH OUT!  THE CONTENTS OF\n   THIS MESSAGE ARE SUSPECT!\"\
    \ at the beginning of the subject line.\n   The re-promulgation of the regulation\
    \ was rescinded, more experts\n   were called in, and a new regulation was issued:\
    \ \"Put it as close to\n   the beginning of the subject line as you can, modulo\
    \ any requirements\n   by other governments.\"  John Doe looked at this, scratched\
    \ his head,\n   and applied a clever little hack, picking the ISO [8859-8] character\n\
    \   set for Hebrew, and duly spelling out the letters \":\" Mem Alef Pe\n   Samech.\n\
    \        Subject: =?iso-8859-8?q?=f1=f4=e0=ee=3a?=\n   Some receivers of this\
    \ message get an error message because they\n   don't have Hebrew installed on\
    \ their systems.  Others get some\n   cryptic indicator of a missing character\
    \ set, such as\n   \"[?iso-8859-8?]\".\n   The FTC called a summit of leading\
    \ thinkers, and the regulation was\n   amended to read \"but don't use languages\
    \ that go from right to left\n   or up and down instead of plain old left to right.\"\
    \  Needless to say,\n   the reaction from the Freedonian League for the Defense\
    \ of Linguistic\n   Diversity killed that proposed regulation really quickly.\n\
    \   The commission continued the cycle of re-promulgation and refinement,\n  \
    \ but ultimately, the regulations continued to contain either a\n   loophole,\
    \ objectionable requirements, or violations of the relevant\n   RFCs.\n"
- title: 4.  Subjects are For Humans, Not Labels
  contents:
  - "4.  Subjects are For Humans, Not Labels\n   The use of an unknown character set,\
    \ or of a very, very long subject\n   line are just two examples of how people\
    \ can try to get around\n   labeling requirements.  In order to specify a regulation\
    \ without\n   ambiguity, it would need to be extremely complex in order to avoid\n\
    \   loopholes such as these.\n   Drafting of regulations is one issue, but there\
    \ is another.  Subject\n   lines are used to specify, as [RFC2822] says, a \"\
    short string\n   identifying the topic of the message.\"\n   Any regulation has\
    \ to compete with the other words in the subject,\n   and this mixing of purposes\
    \ makes it very difficult for a machine to\n   filter out messages at the direction\
    \ of the user.  For example, if\n   one looks for the \"@\" symbol, per the Korean\
    \ law, checks have to be\n   made that this symbol is not a legitimate part of\
    \ a legitimate\n   message.\n   Not only do multiple labeling requirements compete\
    \ with legitimate\n   subject lines, but also there is no easy way for the sender\
    \ of a\n   legitimate message to effectively insert other labels that indicate\n\
    \   to the recipient that-- although the message may have a required\n   label--\
    \ it is actually a message the user might want to see, based\n   on, for example,\
    \ a prior relationship.\n   Even if one considers only the sender of the message,\
    \ it is very\n   difficult to specify a loophole-free way of putting a specific\
    \ label\n   in a specific place.  And, even if we could control what the sender\n\
    \   does, it is an unfortunate fact of life that other agents may also\n   alter\
    \ the subject line.  For example, mailing list management\n   software and even\
    \ personal email filtering systems will often \"munge\"\n   the subject line to\
    \ add information such as the name of a mailing\n   list, or the fact that a message\
    \ comes from a certain group of\n   people.  Such transformations have long been\
    \ generally accepted as\n   being potentially harmful [RFC0886], and are the subject\
    \ of continued\n   discussions, which are outside the scope of the present document\
    \ (see\n   [Koch] and [RFC3834]).\n   The \"Subject:\" field is currently overloaded;\
    \ it has become a handy\n   place for a variety of agents to attempt to insert\
    \ information.\n   Because of that overloading, it is a poor location for specifying\n\
    \   mandatory use of a label, because it is unlikely that label will\n   \"rise\
    \ to the top\" and become apparent to the reader of a message or\n   even to the\
    \ mail-filtering software that examines the mail before the\n   user.  The difficulty\
    \ of implementing subject line labeling, without\n   taking additional steps,\
    \ has been noted by several other\n   commentators, including [Moore-1], [Lessig],\
    \ and [Levine].  Indeed,\n   the problem is a general one.  Keith Moore has pointed\
    \ out seven good\n   reasons why tags of any sort in the \"Subject:\" field have\
    \ potential\n   problems:\n   1.  The \"Subject:\" field space is not strictly\
    \ limited and long\n       fields can be folded.\n   2.  PDAs, phones, and other\
    \ devices and software have only a limited\n       space to display the \"Subject:\"\
    \ field.\n   3.  A variety of different kinds of labels such as \"ADV:\" and\n\
    \       \"[Mailing List Name]\" compete for scarce display space.\n   4.  There\
    \ are conflicting legal requirements from different\n       jurisdictions.\n \
    \  5.  There is a conflict between human use of the \"Subject:\" field and\n \
    \      use of that field for filtering and filing:\n       *  Machine-readable\
    \ tokens interfere with human readability.\n       *  Representation of human-readable\
    \ text was not designed with\n          machine interpretation in mind and, thus,\
    \ does not have a\n          canonical form.\n   6.  Lack of support in a few\
    \ existing mail readers for displaying\n       information from elsewhere in the\
    \ message header (e.g., from\n       newly-defined fields), along with familiarity,\
    \ motivates\n       additional uses of the \"Subject:\", further compounding the\n\
    \       problem.\n   7.  Any text-based tags added or imposed by outside parties\
    \ (i.e.,\n       those that are not the sender or recipient of the message) will\n\
    \       not be reliably meaningful in the recipient's language.\n   Source: [Moore-2].\n"
- title: 5.  Solicitation Class Keywords
  contents:
  - "5.  Solicitation Class Keywords\n   [RFC3865] defines the \"solicitation class\
    \ keyword\", an arbitrary\n   label that can be associated with an electronic\
    \ mail message and\n   transported by the ESMTP mail service, as defined in [RFC2821]\
    \ and\n   related documents.  Solicitation class keywords are formatted like\n\
    \   domain names, but reversed.  For example, the registrant of\n   \"example.com\"\
    \ might specify a particular solicitation class keyword\n   such as \"com.example.adv\"\
    \ that could be inserted in a \"No-Solicit:\"\n   header or in a trace field.\
    \  Anybody with a domain name can specify a\n   solicitation class keyword, and\
    \ anybody sending a message can use any\n   solicitation class keyword that has\
    \ been defined by themselves or by\n   others.\n   This memo argues that the \"\
    No-Solicit:\" approach is either a superior\n   alternative or a necessary complement\
    \ to \"Subject:\" field labeling\n   requirements because:\n   o  One can specify\
    \ very precisely what a label should be and where it\n      should go using the\
    \ \"No-Solicit:\" header, which is designed\n      specifically for this purpose.\n\
    \   o  The sender of a message can add additional solicitation class\n      keywords\
    \ to help distinguish the message.  For example, if the\n      \"Freedonian Direct\
    \ Marketing Council\" wished to form a voluntary\n      consortium of direct marketers\
    \ who subscribe to certain practices,\n      they could specify a keyword (e.g.,\n\
    \      \"org.example.freedonia.good.spam\") and educate the public to set\n  \
    \    their filters to receive these types of messages.\n   o  Message Transfer\
    \ Agents (MTAs) may insert solicitation class\n      keywords in the \"received:\"\
    \ trace fields, thus providing\n      additional tools for recipients to use for\
    \ filtering messages.\n   o  A recipient can also define a solicitation class\
    \ keyword, a tool\n      that allows them to give friends and correspondents a\
    \ \"pass key\"\n      so the recipient's mail filtering software always passes\
    \ through\n      messages containing that keyword.\n   As can be seen, the solicitation\
    \ class keyword approach is flexible\n   enough to serve as a tool for government-mandated\
    \ labeling and for\n   other purposes as well.\n   Most modern email software\
    \ gives users a variety of filtering tools.\n   For example, the popular Eudora\
    \ program allows a user to specify the\n   name of a message header, the desired\
    \ match (e.g., a wild card or\n   regular expression, or simply a phrase to match),\
    \ and an action to\n   take (e.g., moving the message to a particular folder,\
    \ sounding an\n   alarm, or even automatically deleting messages with harmful\
    \ content\n   such as viruses).  There is one popular email reader that only allows\n\
    \   filtering on selected fields, such as \"To:\", \"From:\", or \"Subject:\"\
    ,\n   but that program is the exception to the rule.\n   In summary, for senders\
    \ and receivers of email, use of the\n   \"No-Solicit:\" mechanism would be simple\
    \ to understand and use.  For\n   policy makers, it would be extremely simple\
    \ to specify the format and\n   placement of the solicitation class keyword. \
    \ Needless to say, the\n   issue of how to define what classes of messages are\
    \ subject to such a\n   requirement, and how to enforce it, are beyond the scope\
    \ of this\n   discussion.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The use of labels in the \"Subject:\" field gives\
    \ users and policy\n   makers an unwarranted illusion that certain classes of\
    \ messages will\n   be \"flagged\" correctly by the MUA of the recipient.  The\
    \ difficulty\n   in specifying requirements for labels in the \"Subject:\" field\
    \ in a\n   precise, unambiguous manner makes it difficult for the MUA to\n   systematically\
    \ identify messages that are labeled; this leads to both\n   false positive and\
    \ false negative indications.\n   In addition, conflicting labeling requirements\
    \ by policy makers, as\n   well as other current practices that use the \"Subject:\"\
    \ for a variety\n   of purposes, make that field \"overloaded.\"  In order to\
    \ meet these\n   conflicting requirements, software designers and bulk mail senders\n\
    \   resort to a variety of tactics, some of which may violate fundamental\n  \
    \ requirements of the mail standards, such as the practice of an\n   intermediate\
    \ MTA inserting various labels into the \"Subject:\" field.\n   Such practices\
    \ increase the likelihood of non-compliant mail messages\n   and, thus, threaten\

- title: 7.  Recommendations
  contents:
  - "7.  Recommendations\n   This document makes three recommendations:\n   1.  There\
    \ is widespread skepticism in the technical community that\n       labels of any\
    \ sort will be effective.  Such labels should\n       probably be avoided as ineffective\
    \ at best.\n   2.  Despite the widespread skepticism expressed in point 1, over\
    \ 36\n       states in the U.S. and 27 countries have passed anti-spam\n     \
    \  measures, many of which require labels [Sorkin].  If such labels\n       are\
    \ to be used, despite the widespread skepticism expressed in\n       point 1,\
    \ there is a fairly broad consensus in the technical\n       community that such\
    \ labels should not be put in the \"Subject:\"\n       field and should go in\
    \ a designated header field.\n   3.  If, despite points 1 and 2, a policy of mandating\
    \ labels in the\n       \"Subject:\" field is adopted, a complementary requirement\
    \ to use\n       the \"No-Solicit:\" should also be added.\n"
