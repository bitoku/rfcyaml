Abstract This memo defines a set of DECnet Phase IV extensions that have been created for the Internet MIB.
When used in conjunction with the structure of management information (RFC 1155), the management information base for network management of TCP/IP based internets (RFC 1213) and the Simple Network Management Protocol (RFC 1157), it will be possible to provide integrated network management of combined TCP/IP and DECnet Phase IV based internets.
This document was produced by the DECnet Phase IV MIB working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
Introduction With the adoption of The Simple Network Management Protocol (RFC 1157), the management information base for network management of TCP/IP based internets (RFC 1213), and the structure of management information (RFC 1155), by the Internet, and a large number of vendor implementations of these standards in commercially available products, it became possible to provide a higher level of effective network management in TCP/IP based internets than previously available.
With the growth in the use of these standards, network managers desired to use this environment as a base for providing integrated network management of multi protocol networks.
DECnet Phase IV is one widely used protocol which often coexists in IP based internets.
This memo provides the mechanisms by which IP  based management stations can effectively manage DECnet Phase IV based systems (especially router products) in an integrated fashion through the use of the standard Internet SMI, MIB and Simple Network Management Protocol.
DECnet Phase IV objects have been defined to be used in conjunction with the Internet MIB to allow access and control of these new objects by the Internet community.
Additional support for other DECnet based protocols such as RBMS (remote bridge management software) or other Digital Equipment Corporation Specific Hardware platforms is not included in this document.
The objects included in this memo have been created from the DIGITAL Network Architecture Network Management Functional Specification Version 4.0.0 Dated July 1983.
An attempt has been made to provide a reasonable ordering of these variables into groups.
These groups are:  System Group  Network Management Group  Session Group
End Group  Routing Group  Circuit Group
DDCMP Group  DDCMP Multipoint Control Group  Ethernet Group
Counters Group  Adjacency Group  Line Group  Non Broadcast Line Group  Area Group
An effort has also been made to preserve the original syntax of the object wherever possible, for example, a DECnet Phase IV object is Executor State.
This was originally coded as a NICE (Network Information and Control Exchange) data type which is a Coded single field object of 1 byte in length.
When converted for inclusion into the Internet MIB using the Internet SMI, it became an enumerated integer.
All objects in this memo are described using the standard Internet SMI and BER of RFC 1155.
A complete description of an object will include the name, syntax and encoding.
Just as with objects supported in the MIB (RFC 1156), an object name is identified with an object identifier which has been administratively assigned.
This identifies an Object Type.
When an object type is combined with a specific instance, the particular object is uniquely identified.
The use of Object Descriptors in this memo is consistent with that of RFC 1156 they are text strings meant to be read by humans.
The descriptors have been taken from the original DIGITAL Network Architecture Network Management Functional Specification Version 4.0.0 Dated July 1983 which defined DECnet Phase IV objects.
These names were then massaged to put them in a form as consistent as possible with object type names listed in the standard Internet MIB.
Object defintion information is also taken directly from the Network Architecture Network Managment Functional Specification cited above wherever possible.
In this document, EXECUTOR is intended to reference only the DECnet software and is not intended to effect any other protocols which may be running on the system.
3.1  Format of Definitions An object in this memo is specified by five fields of information: Object, Syntax, Definition, Access, and Status.
The OBJECT is a textual name (OBJECT DESCRIPTOR) for that object type combined with an administratively obtained OBJECT IDENTIFIER.
For each object type, its abstract syntax is presented using the ASN.1 specified in RFC 1155.
A general description of the object type.
Its original purpose in the DECnet Phase IV environment is given so that all implementers and users will consistently interpret the information contained in each object type.
Changes in format to make the object consistent with RFC 1155 are also noted.
The standard access keywords supported in RFC 1156 are used.
The keywords used in this MIB are: read only, read write, and, not  accessible.
The status field is used to describe with a single keyword whether the object type is mandatory or optional.
Status keywords of obsolete and deprecated are not used in this memo since this is the first version of the DECnet Phase IV MIB.
3.2  Textual Conventions New datatypes have been introduced as a textual conventions in this DECnet Phase IV MIB document.
The purpose of these additions is to facilitate understanding of new objects in this MIB.
No changes to the SMI or the SNMP are necessary to support these conventions which are described in 4.0 (Object Definitions).

mib 2, DisplayString FROM RFC1213 MIB;   DECNet Phase
This data type is intended as a short word representation of   standard DECnet Phase IV addresses.
DECnet addresses are   hierarchically structured numbers assigned to a particular   DECnet node.
The address is structured so that the area   number is contained in the most significant 6 bits of the   first octet.
The next 2 bits of the first octet contain   the first two bits of the host address.
The remainder of   the host address is contained in the second octet.
This data type has been created for DECnet  counters.
These   counters latch at their maximum specified value until either   the system is restared, or they are reset to zero by the user   or management software.

ACCESS read write STATUS mandatory DESCRIPTION
"This value determines the maximum time in seconds allowed between Routing updates on Ethernet circuits.
When this timer expired before a routing update occurs, a routing update is forced.
With a standard calculation, Routing also uses this timer to enforce a minimum delay between routing updates."
It therefore determines the maximum size message that can be forwarded.
This size includes protocol overhead down to and including the End Communication layer, plus a constant value of 6.
(This value of 6 is included to provide compatibility with the parameter definition in Phase III, which included the Routing overhead.)
It does not include Routing or Data link overhead (except for the constant value of 6).
There is one buffer size for all circuits.
The BUFFER SIZE defines the maximum size messages that the Routing layer can forward.
The SEGMENT BUFFER SIZE (defined below) defines the maximum size messages that the End Communication layer can transmit or receive.
The SEGMENT BUFFER SIZE is always less than or equal to the BUFFER SIZE.
Normally the two parameters will be equal.
They may be different to allow the network manager to alter buffer sizes on all nodes without interruption of service.
They both include an extra 6 bytes for compatibility with Phase III."

For correct operation, this parameter must not be less than the maximum path cost of the network."
ACCESS read write STATUS mandatory DESCRIPTION
"This value represents the maximum number of routing hops allowable from the executor to any other reachable node within an area.
(A hop is the logical distance over a circuit between two adjacent nodes.)
This parameter defines the point where the executor node's Routing routing decision algorithm declares another node unreachable because the length of the shortest path between the two nodes is too long.
For correct operation, this parameter must not be less than the network diameter.
(The network diameter is the reachability distance between the two nodes of the network having the greatest reachability distance, where reachability distance is the length the shortest path between a given pair of nodes.)
ACCESS read write STATUS mandatory DESCRIPTION
"This value represents the maximum number of nodes a message coming into the executor node can have visited.
If the message is not for this node and the MAXIMUM VISITS number is exceeded, the message is discarded.
The MAXIMUM VISITS parameter defines the point where the packet lifetime control algorithm discards a packet that has traversed too many nodes.
For correct operation, this parameter must not be less than the maximum path length of the network.
