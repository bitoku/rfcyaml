  - "                     An FTP Command-Naming Problem\nIn using the File Transfer\
    \ Protocol, I've noticed that the choice of\nnames for two crucial commands is\
    \ faulty.  The commands are STOR, which\ntell the Server to take a file in, and\
    \ RETR, which tells the Server to\nsend a file out.  The trouble is that telling\
    \ the Server to \"retrieve\" a\nfile sounds like a desire for the file to be taken\
    \ in by the Server\nrather than be sent out.  For that matter, telling the Server\
    \ to \"store\"\nthe file sounds like it could be either a command to send it out\
    \ or a\ncommand to take it in.  The names of the commands, then, are both\nconnotatively\
    \ ambiguous and not very mnemonic if they are thought of as\ncommands to the Server.\
    \  (If they're thought of as commands to the User\nHost, they make more sense\
    \ -- but they're not commands to the Use\n(Host.)\nOf course, memorizing the denotations\
    \ -- despite the connotations -- is\na solution.  But it would probably be easier\
    \ for users if the names were\nmore suggestive of the functions named.  Therefore,\
    \ I propose that PUSH\nand PULL be added to the FTP as synonyms for RETR and STOR,\
    \ respectively\n(I hope).  Even GIVE and TAKE would be an improvement.  At the\
    \ very\nleast, SEND should be a synonym for RETR. (1)\n---------------------\n\
    (1)  Note that by specifying synonyms rather than replacement, existing\ncorrect\
    \ reflexes -- and \"automata\" -- are not disturbed, while newcomers\nto FTPing\
    \ are given a better chance of choosing right.\n       [ This RFC was put into\
