  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   GMPLS provides control for multiple switching technologies and for\n\
    \   hierarchical switching within a technology.  GMPLS routing and\n   signaling\
    \ use common values to indicate the type of switching\n   technology.  These values\
    \ are carried in routing protocols via the\n   Switching Capability field, and\
    \ in signaling protocols via the\n   Switching Type field.  While the values used\
    \ in these fields are the\n   primary indicators of the technology and hierarchy\
    \ level being\n   controlled, the values are not consistently defined and used\
    \ across\n   the different technologies supported by GMPLS.  This document is\n\
    \   intended to resolve the inconsistent definition and use of the\n   Switching\
    \ Capability and Type fields by narrowly scoping the meaning\n   and use of the\
    \ fields.  This document updates all documents that use\n   the GMPLS Switching\
    \ Capability and Types fields, in particular RFCs\n   3471, 4202, 4203, and 5307.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) provides\
    \ control\n   for multiple switching technologies.  It also supports hierarchical\n\
    \   switching within a technology.  The original GMPLS Architecture, per\n   [RFC3945],\
    \ included support for five types of switching capabilities.\n   An additional\
    \ type was also defined in [RFC6002].  The switching\n   types defined in these\
    \ documents include:\n   1. Packet Switch Capable (PSC)\n   2. Layer-2 Switch\
    \ Capable (L2SC)\n   3. Time-Division Multiplex Capable (TDM)\n   4. Lambda Switch\
    \ Capable (LSC)\n   5. Fiber-Switch Capable (FSC)\n   6. Data Channel Switching\
    \ Capable (DCSC)\n   Support for the original types was defined for routing in\
    \ [RFC4202],\n   [RFC4203], and [RFC5307], where the types were represented in\
    \ the\n   Switching Capability (Switching Cap) field.  In general, hierarchy\n\
    \   within a type is addressed in a type-specific fashion, and a single\n   Switching\
    \ Capability field value is defined per type.  The exception\n   to this is PSC,\
    \ which was assigned four values to indicate four\n   levels of hierarchy: PSC-1,\
    \ PSC-2, PSC-3, and PSC-4.  The same values\n   used in routing are defined for\
    \ signaling in [RFC3471], and are\n   carried in the Switching Type field.  Following\
    \ the IANA registry, we\n   refer to the values used in the routing Switching\
    \ Capability field\n   and signaling Switching Type field as Switching Types.\n\
    \   In general, a Switching Type does not indicate a specific data-plane\n   technology;\
    \ this needs to be inferred from context.  For example,\n   L2SC was defined to\
    \ cover Ethernet and ATM, and TDM was defined to\n   cover both SONET/SDH [RFC4606]\
    \ and G.709 [RFC4328].  The basic\n   assumption was that different technologies\
    \ of the same type would\n   never operate within the same control, i.e., signaling\
    \ and routing\n   domains.\n   The past approach in assignment of Switching Types\
    \ has proven to be\n   problematic from two perspectives.  The first issue is\
    \ that some\n   examples of switching technologies have different levels of switching\n\
    \   that can be performed within the same technology.  For example, there\n  \
    \ are multiple types of Ethernet switching that may occur within a\n   provider\
    \ network.  The second issue is that the Switching Capability\n   field value\
    \ is used in Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) to indicate\n   the format of the\
    \ Switching Capability-specific information (SCSI)\n   field, and that an implicit\
    \ mapping of type to SCSI format is\n   impractical for implementations that support\
    \ multiple switching\n   technologies.  These issues led to the introduction of\
    \ two new types\n   for Ethernet in [RFC6004] and [RFC6060], namely:\n      7.\
    \ Ethernet Virtual Private Line (EVPL)\n      8. 802_1 PBB-TE (Provider Backbone\
    \ Bridge Traffic Engineering)\n   An additional value is also envisioned to be\
    \ assigned in support of\n   G.709v3 by [GMPLS-G709] in order to disambiguate\
    \ the format of the\n   SCSI field.\n   While a common representation of hierarchy\
    \ levels within a switching\n   technology certainly fits the design objectives\
    \ of GMPLS, the\n   definition of multiple PSC Switching Types has also proven\
    \ to be of\n   little value.  Notably, there are no known uses of PSC-2, PSC-3,\
    \ and\n   PSC-4.\n   This document proposes to resolve such inconsistent definitions\
    \ and\n   uses of the Switching Types by reducing the scope of the related\n \
    \  fields and narrowing their use.  In particular, this document\n   deprecates\
    \ the use of the Switching Types as an identifier of\n   hierarchy levels within\
    \ a switching technology and limits its use to\n   the identification of a per-switching\
    \ technology SCSI field format.\n   This document updates all documents that use\
    \ the GMPLS Switching\n   Capability and Switching Type fields, in particular\
    \ RFCs 3471, 4202,\n   4203, and 5307.\n"
