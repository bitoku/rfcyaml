  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 3280 [PKIX1] specifies the validation of certification\
    \ paths.\n   One aspect involves the determination that a certificate has not\
    \ been\n   revoked, and one revocation checking mechanism is the Certificate\n\
    \   Revocation List (CRL).  CRL validation is also specified in RFC 3280,\n  \
    \ which involves the constructions of a valid certification path for\n   the CRL\
    \ issuer.  Building a CRL issuer certification path from the\n   signer of the\
    \ CRL to a trust anchor is straightforward when the\n   certificate of the CRL\
    \ issuer is present in the certification path\n   associated with the target certificate,\
    \ but it can be complex in\n   other situations.\n   There are several legitimate\
    \ scenarios where the certificate of the\n   CRL issuer is not present, or easily\
    \ discovered, from the target\n   certification path.  This can be the case when\
    \ indirect CRLs are\n   used, when the Certification Authority (CA) that issued\
    \ the target\n   certificate changes its certificate signing key, or when the\
    \ CA\n   employs separate keys for certificate signing and CRL signing.\n   Methods\
    \ of finding the certificate of the CRL issuer are currently\n   available, such\
    \ as through an accessible directory location or\n   through use of the Subject\
    \ Information Access extension in\n   intermediary CA certificates.\n   Directory\
    \ lookup requires existence and access to a directory that\n   has been populated\
    \ with all of the necessary certificates.  The\n   Subject Information Access\
    \ extension, which supports building the CRL\n   issuer certification path top-down\
    \ (in the direction from the trust\n   anchor to the CRL issuer), requires that\
    \ some certificates in the CRL\n   issuer certification path includes an appropriate\
    \ Subject Information\n   Access extension.\n   RFC 3280 [PKIX1] provides for\
    \ bottom-up discovery of certification\n   paths through the Authority Information\
    \ Access extension, where the\n   id-ad-caIssuers access method may specify one\
    \ or more accessLocation\n   fields that reference CA certificates associated\
    \ with the certificate\n   containing this extension.\n   This document enables\
    \ the use of the Authority Information Access\n   extension in CRLs, enabling\
    \ a CRL checking application to use the\n   access method (id-ad-caIssuers) to\
    \ locate certificates that may be\n   useful in the construction of a valid CRL\
    \ issuer certification path\n   to an appropriate trust anchor.\n"

- title: 2.  Authority Information Access CRL Extension
  contents:
  - "2.  Authority Information Access CRL Extension\n   This section defines the use\
    \ of the Authority Information Access\n   extension in a CRL.  The syntax and\
    \ semantics defined in RFC 3280\n   [PKIX1] for the certificate extensions are\
    \ also used for the CRL\n   extension.\n   This CRL extension MUST NOT be marked\
    \ critical.\n   This extension MUST be identified by the extension object identifier\n\
    \   (OID) defined in RFC 3280 (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.1.1), and the\n   AuthorityInfoAccessSyntax\
    \ MUST be used to form the extension value.\n   For convenience, the ASN.1 [X.680]\
    \ definition of the Authority\n   Information Access extension is repeated below.\n\
    \      id-pe-authorityInfoAccess OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { id-pe 1 }\n      AuthorityInfoAccessSyntax\
    \  ::=  SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF\n                               AccessDescription\n\
    \      AccessDescription  ::=  SEQUENCE {\n         accessMethod          OBJECT\
    \ IDENTIFIER,\n         accessLocation        GeneralName  }\n      id-ad OBJECT\
    \ IDENTIFIER  ::=  { id-pkix 48 }\n      id-ad-caIssuers OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=\
    \  { id-ad 2 }\n   When present in a CRL, this extension MUST include at least\
    \ one\n   AccessDescription specifying id-ad-caIssuers as the accessMethod.\n\
    \   Access method types other than id-ad-caIssuers MUST NOT be included.\n   At\
    \ least one instance of AccessDescription SHOULD specify an\n   accessLocation\
    \ that is an HTTP [HTTP/1.1] or Lightweight Directory\n   Access Protocol [LDAP]\
    \ Uniform Resource Identifier [URI].\n   Where the information is available via\
    \ HTTP or FTP, accessLocation\n   MUST be a uniformResourceIdentifier and the\
    \ URI MUST point to a\n   certificate containing file.  The certificate file MUST\
    \ contain\n   either a single Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) [X.690] encoded\n\
    \   certificate (indicated by the .cer file extension) or a collection of\n  \
    \ certificates (indicated by the .p7c file extension):\n      .cer   A single\
    \ DER encoded certificate as specified in\n             RFC 2585 [PKIX-CERT].\n\
    \      .p7c   A \"certs-only\" CMS message as specified in RFC 2797 [CMC].\n \
    \    Conforming applications that support HTTP or FTP for accessing\n     certificates\
    \ MUST be able to accept .cer files and SHOULD be able\n     to accept .p7c files.\n\
    \     HTTP server implementations accessed via the URI SHOULD use the\n     appropriate\
    \ MIME content-type for the certificate containing file.\n     Specifically, the\
    \ HTTP server SHOULD use the content-type\n     application/pkix-cert [PKIX-CERT]\
    \ for a single DER encoded\n     certificate and application/pkcs7-mime [CMC]\
    \ for CMS certs-only\n     (PKCS#7).  Consuming clients may use the MIME type\
    \ and file\n     extension as a hint to the file content, but should not depend\n\
    \     solely on the presence of the correct MIME type or file extension\n    \
    \ in the server response.\n     When the accessLocation is a directoryName, the\
    \ information is to\n     be obtained by the application from whatever directory\
    \ server is\n     locally configured.  When one CA public key is used to validate\n\
    \     signatures on certificates and CRLs, the desired CA certificate is\n   \
    \  stored in the crossCertificatePair and/or cACertificate attributes\n     as\
    \ specified in [RFC2587].  When different public keys are used to\n     validate\
    \ signatures on certificates and CRLs, the desired\n     certificate is stored\
    \ in the userCertificate attribute as specified\n     in [RFC2587].  Thus, implementations\
    \ that support the directoryName\n     form of accessLocation MUST be prepared\
    \ to find the needed\n     certificate in any of these three attributes.  The\
    \ protocol that an\n     application uses to access the directory (e.g., DAP or\
    \ LDAP) is a\n     local matter.\n     Where the information is available via\
    \ LDAP, the accessLocation\n     SHOULD be a uniformResourceIdentifier.  The URI\
    \ MUST specify a\n     distingishedName and attribute(s) and MAY specify a host\
    \ name\n     (e.g., ldap://ldap.example.com/cn=example%20CA,dc=example,dc=com?\n\
    \     cACertificate;binary,crossCertificatePair;binary).  Omitting the\n     host\
    \ name (e.g.,\n     ldap:///cn=example%20CA,dc=example,dc=com?cACertificate;binary)\
    \ has\n     the effect of specifying the use of whatever LDAP server is locally\n\
    \     configured.  The URI MUST list appropriate attribute descriptions\n    \
    \ for one or more attributes holding certificates or cross-\n     certificate\
    \ pairs.\n"

  - "3.  Security Considerations\n     Implementers should take into account the possible\
    \ existence of\n     multiple unrelated CAs and CRL issuers with the same name.\n\
    \     Implementers should be aware of risks involved if the Authority\n     Information\
    \ Access extensions of corrupted CRLs contain links to\n     malicious code. \
    \ Implementers should always take the steps of\n     validating the retrieved\
    \ data to ensure that the data is properly\n     formed.\n"
