  - "1.  Overview\n   [ISO10589] defines the format of Type-Length-Values (TLVs) that\
    \ may\n   be sent in IS-IS Protocol Data Units (PDUs).  The first octet of a\n\
    \   TLV encodes the \"type\" or \"codepoint\" that provides a scope for the\n\
    \   information and information format that follows.  The protocol is\n   therefore\
    \ limited to 256 different codepoints that may be assigned.\n   This number has\
    \ proved generous as regards the information required\n   for correct operation\
    \ of the IS-IS protocol.  However, the increasing\n   use of IS-IS Link State\
    \ Protocol Data Units (LSPs) for advertisement\n   of generic information (GENINFO)\
    \ not directly related to the\n   operation of the IS-IS protocol places additional\
    \ demands on the TLV\n   encoding space that have the potential to consume a significant\n\
    \   number of TLV codepoints.  This document therefore defines an\n   encoding\
    \ format for GENINFO that minimizes the consumption of TLV\n   codepoints and\
    \ also maximizes the flexibility of the formats that can\n   be used to represent\
    \ GENINFO.\n   This document also discusses optimal behavior associated with the\n\
    \   advertisement and flooding of LSPs containing GENINFO in order to\n   avoid\
    \ the advertisement of stale information and minimize the\n   presence of duplicate\
    \ or conflicting information when advertisements\n   are updated.\n   The manner\
    \ in which the information contained in GENINFO TLVs is\n   exchanged between\
    \ an instance of the IS-IS protocol and the\n   application that generates or\
    \ consumes the GENINFO is outside the\n   scope of this specification.\n   In\
    \ order to minimize the impact that advertisement of GENINFO may\n   have on the\
    \ operation of routing, such advertisements MUST occur in\n   the context of a\
    \ non-zero instance of the IS-IS protocol as defined\n   in [RFC6822] except where\
    \ the rules for the use of the zero instance\n   set out later in this document\
    \ are followed.\n"

- title: 3.  Encoding Format for GENINFO
  contents:
  - "3.  Encoding Format for GENINFO\n   The encoding format defined below has the\
    \ following goals regarding\n   the advertisement of GENINFO in IS-IS LSPs:\n\
    \   o  Minimize the number of IS-IS top level and sub-TLV codepoints\n      required\n\
    \   o  Minimize the depth of sub-TLV levels required\n   In order to support these\
    \ goals, a new IANA registry has been\n   created.  This registry manages the\
    \ assignment of IS-IS GENINFO\n   Application Identifiers.  These numbers are\
    \ unsigned 16-bit numbers\n   ranging in value from 1 to 65535.  Application-specific\
    \ sub-TLV\n   codepoints are unsigned 8-bit numbers ranging in value from 0 to\
    \ 255.\n   The assignment of the sub-TLV codepoints is scoped by the Application\n\

- title: 3.2.  Use of Sub-TLVs in GENINFO TLV
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Use of Sub-TLVs in GENINFO TLV\n   [RFC5305] introduced the definition\
    \ and use of sub-TLVs.  One of the\n   advantages of using sub-TLVs rather than\
    \ fixed encoding of\n   information inside a TLV is to allow for the addition\
    \ of new\n   information in a backwards compatible manner, i.e., just as with\n\
    \   TLVs, implementations are required to ignore sub-TLVs that they do\n   not\
    \ understand.\n   GENINFO TLVs MAY include sub-TLVs in the application specific\n\
    \   information as deemed necessary and appropriate for each application.\n  \
    \ The scope of the codepoints used in such sub-TLVs is defined by the\n   combination\
    \ of the GENINFO TLV codepoint and the Application ID,\n   i.e., the sub-TLV codepoints\
    \ are private to the application.  Such\n   sub-TLVs are referred to as APPsub-TLVs.\n\
    \   Additional levels of APPsub-TLVs may be required when there is\n   variable\
    \ information that is scoped by a specific APPsub-TLV.  These\n   \"nested\" sub-TLVs\
    \ MUST be encoded in the same manner as sub-TLVs,\n   i.e., with a one-octet Type\
    \ field, a one-octet Length field, and zero\n   or more octets of Value.\n"
- title: 4.  GENINFO Flooding Procedures
  contents:
  - "4.  GENINFO Flooding Procedures\n   This section describes procedures that apply\
    \ to the propagation of\n   LSPs that contain GENINFO TLVs.  These procedures\
    \ have been\n   previously discussed in [RFC4971].  This section is intended to\
    \ serve\n   as a reference specification for future documents that define the\
    \ use\n   of GENINFO TLV(s) for a specific application -- eliminating the need\n\
    \   to repeat the definition of these procedures in the application-\n   specific\
    \ documents.\n   Each GENINFO TLV contains information regarding exactly one\n\
    \   application instance as identified by the Application ID in the\n   GENINFO\
    \ TLV.  When it is necessary to advertise sets of information\n   with the same\
    \ Application ID that have different flooding scopes, a\n   router MUST originate\
    \ a minimum of one GENINFO TLV for each required\n   flooding scope.  GENINFO\
    \ TLVs that contain information having area/\n   level scope will have the S bit\
    \ clear.  These TLVs MUST NOT be leaked\n   into another level.  GENINFO TLVs\
    \ that contain information that has\n   domain scope will have the S bit set.\
    \  These TLVs MUST be leaked into\n   other IS-IS levels.  When a TLV is leaked\
    \ from Level-2 to Level-1,\n   the D bit MUST be set in the Level-1 LSP advertisement.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Leaking Procedures
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Leaking Procedures\n   When leaking GENINFO TLVs downward from Level-2\
    \ into Level-1, if the\n   originator of the TLV is a Level-1 router in another\
    \ area, it is\n   possible that multiple copies of the same TLV may be received\
    \ from\n   multiple L2 routers in the originating area.  A router performing\n\
    \   downward leaking MUST check for such duplication by comparing the\n   contents\
    \ of the TLVs.  The set of LSPs generated by a router for a\n   given level MUST\
    \ NOT contain two or more copies of the same GENINFO\n   TLV.\n   In order to\
    \ prevent the use of stale GENINFO information, a system\n   MUST NOT use a GENINFO\
    \ TLV present in an LSP of a system that is not\n   currently reachable via Level-x\
    \ paths, where \"x\" is the level (1 or\n   2) associated with the LSP in which\
    \ the GENINFO TLV appears.  Note\n   that leaking a GENINFO TLV is one of the\
    \ uses that is prohibited\n   under these conditions.  The following example illustrates\
    \ what might\n   occur in the absence of this restriction.\n   Example: If Level-1\
    \ router A generates a GENINFO TLV and floods it to\n   two L1/L2 routers S and\
    \ T, they will flood it into the Level-2 sub-\n   domain.  Now suppose the Level-1\
    \ area partitions, such that A and S\n   are in one partition and T is in another.\
    \  IP routing will still\n   continue to work, but if A now issues a revised version\
    \ of the\n   GENINFO TLV, or decides to stop advertising it, S will follow suit,\n\
    \   but T will continue to advertise the old version until the LSP times\n   out.\n\
    \   Routers in other areas have to choose whether to trust T's copy of\n   A's\
    \ GENINFO TLV or S's copy of A's information and they have no\n   reliable way\
    \ to choose.  By making sure that T stops leaking A's\n   information, this removes\
    \ the possibility that other routers will use\n   stale information from A.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Minimizing Update Confusion
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Minimizing Update Confusion\n   If an update to a TLV is advertised in\
    \ an LSP with a different number\n   than the LSP associated with the old advertisement,\
    \ the possibility\n   exists that other systems can temporarily have either 0\
    \ copies of a\n   particular advertisement or 2 copies of a particular advertisement,\n\
    \   depending on the order in which new copies of the LSP that had the\n   old\
    \ advertisement and the LSP that has the new advertisement arrive\n   at other\
    \ systems.\n   Whenever possible, an implementation SHOULD advertise the update\
    \ to a\n   GENINFO TLV in the LSP with the same number as the advertisement that\n\
    \   it replaces.  Where this is not possible, the two affected LSPs\n   SHOULD\
    \ be flooded as an atomic action.\n   Systems that receive an update to an existing\
    \ GENINFO TLV can\n   minimize the potential disruption associated with the update\
    \ by\n   employing a hold-down time prior to processing the update so as to\n\
    \   allow for the receipt of multiple LSPs associated with the same\n   update\
    \ prior to beginning processing.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Interpreting Attribute Information
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Interpreting Attribute Information\n   Where a receiving system has two\
    \ copies of a GENINFO TLV with the\n   same Application ID, attribute information\
    \ in the two TLVs that does\n   not conflict MUST be considered additive.  When\
    \ information in the\n   two GENINFO TLVs conflicts, i.e., there are different\
    \ settings for a\n   given attribute, the procedure used to choose which copy\
    \ shall be\n   used is undefined.\n"
- title: 5.  Use of a Separate Protocol Instance
  contents:
  - "5.  Use of a Separate Protocol Instance\n   The use of the IS-IS flooding mechanism\
    \ as a means of reliably and\n   efficiently propagating information is understandably\
    \ attractive.\n   However, it is prudent to remember that the primary purpose\
    \ of that\n   mechanism is to flood information necessary for the correct operation\n\
    \   of the IS-IS protocol.  Flooding of information not directly related\n   to\
    \ the use of the IS-IS protocol in support of routing degrades the\n   operation\
    \ of the protocol.  Degradation occurs because the frequency\n   of LSP updates\
    \ is increased and because the processing of non-routing\n   information in each\
    \ router consumes resources whose primary\n   responsibility is to efficiently\
    \ respond to reachability changes in\n   the network.\n   Advertisement of GENINFO\
    \ therefore MUST occur in the context of a\n   non-zero instance of the IS-IS\
    \ protocol as defined in [RFC6822]\n   except when the use in the zero instance\
    \ is defined in a Standards\n   Track RFC.\n   The use of a separate instance\
    \ of the protocol allows both the\n   flooding and the processing of the non-routing\
    \ information to be\n   decoupled from the information necessary to support correct\
    \ routing\n   of data in the network.  The flooding and processing of non-routing\n\
    \   information can then be prioritized appropriately.\n   Use of a separate protocol\
    \ instance to advertise GENINFO does not\n   eliminate the need to use prudence\
    \ in the frequency with which such\n   information is updated.  One of the most\
    \ egregious oversights is a\n   failure to appropriately dampen changes in the\
    \ information to be\n   advertised; this can lead to flooding storms.  Documents\
    \ that specify\n   the use of the mechanisms defined here MUST define the expected\
    \ rate\n   of change of the information to be advertised.\n   If desirable, independent\
    \ control of the flooding scope for\n   information related to two different applications\
    \ can be achieved by\n   utilizing separate non-zero protocol instances for each\
    \ application\n   [RFC6822].\n"

    \ of application-specific\n   information in IS-IS LSPs that is not directly related\
