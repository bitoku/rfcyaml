  - "1.  Introduction\n   The LoST protocol [RFC5222] maps service and locations to\
    \ destination\n   addresses.  A LoST server does this by provisioning boundary\
    \ maps or\n   areas against service URNs.  The boundary is a polygon made up of\n\
    \   sets of geodetic coordinates specifying an enclosed area.  In some\n   circumstances,\
    \ an area enclosed by a polygon, also known as an\n   exterior polygon, may contain\
    \ exception areas, or holes, that for the\n   same service must yield a different\
    \ destination to that described by\n   the larger area.\n   This document describes\
    \ a profile of Geographic Markup Language (GML)\n   [ISO-19107] polygons that\
    \ constrains their representation when used\n   for describing service boundaries.\
    \  The profile removes a number of\n   permutations that are difficult to process.\
    \  This allows for\n   simplified implementations that are not capable of handling\
    \ all\n   potential variations allowed by GML.  A fully conformant GML\n   implementation\
    \ must produce polygons that fit this profile to ensure\n   interoperability.\n\

    \ Figure 9: Service Boundary Specifications\n   It is considered likely that LoST\
    \ servers will need to provide\n   responses sufficiently quickly to allow real-time\
    \ queries to be\n   performed as part of an emergency call routing flow.  It is\
    \ for this\n   reason that databases supporting native geospatial query techniques\n\
    \   are desirable and that service boundary specifications that are\n   easily\
    \ mapped to internal data structures are preferred.  Using\n   interior boundaries\
    \ makes support for this operation easy, while\n   allowing an arbitrary number\
    \ of holes in a service boundary to be\n   specified.\n   Each polygon is stored\
    \ in the geospatial database and mapped to a\n   service URN and destination URI.\
    \  Many geospatial databases natively\n   support polygons with interior exclusions.\
    \  Without native support,\n   interior boundaries can be stored against the polygon\
    \ and can checked\n   separately.  A location falls within the area described\
    \ by a polygon\n   if it is within the exterior boundary and not within any interior\n\
    \   boundary.\n   In the above example, if a location falls within the interior\n\
    \   boundary, it maps to the \"Inner Area Police\" service; likewise, if a\n \
    \  location falls within the exterior boundary, but not within the\n   interior\
    \ boundary, it maps to the \"Outer Area Police\" service.\n"
