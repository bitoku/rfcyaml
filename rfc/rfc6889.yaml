- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Due to specific problems, Network Address Translation - Protocol\n\
    \   Translation (NAT-PT) was deprecated by the IETF as a mechanism to\n   perform\
    \ IPv6-IPv4 translation.  Since then, new efforts have been\n   undertaken within\
    \ IETF to standardize alternative mechanisms to\n   perform IPv6-IPv4 translation.\
    \  This document analyzes to what extent\n   the new stateful translation mechanisms\
    \ avoid the problems that\n   caused the IETF to deprecate NAT-PT.\n"

- title: 1.2.  Context
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Context\n   Stateful 64 is widely seen as a major interconnection technique\n\
    \   designed to enable communications between IPv6-only and IPv4-only\n   networks.\
    \  One of the building blocks of the stateful 64 is\n   decoupling the DNS functionality\
    \ from the protocol translation\n   itself.\n   This approach is pragmatic in\
    \ the sense that there is no dependency\n   on DNS implementation for the successful\
    \ NAT handling.  As long as\n   there is a function (e.g., DNS64 [RFC6147] or\
    \ other means) that can\n   construct an IPv6-embedded IPv4 address with a pre-configured\
    \ IPv6\n   prefix, an IPv4 address and a suffix (refer to [RFC6052]), NAT64 will\n\
    \   work just fine.\n   The focus of the stateful 64 is on the deployment and\
    \ not the\n   implementation details.  As long as a NAT64 implementation conforms\n\
    \   to the expected behavior, as desired in the deployment scenario, the\n   details\
    \ are not very important as mentioned in this excerpt from\n   [RFC6146]:\n  \
    \    A NAT64 MAY perform the steps in a different order, or MAY perform\n    \
    \  different steps, but the externally visible outcome MUST be the\n      same\
    \ as the one described in this document.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Scope
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Scope\n   This document provides an analysis of how the proposed set of\n\
    \   documents that specify stateful IPv6-only to IPv4-only translation\n   and\
    \ replace Network Address Translation - Protocol Translation\n   (NAT-PT) [RFC2766]\
    \ address the issues raised in [RFC4966].\n   As a reminder, it is worth mentioning\
    \ the analysis is limited in the\n   sense that hosts from IPv6 networks can initiate\
    \ a communication to\n   IPv4 network/Internet, but not vice versa.  This corresponds\
    \ to\n   Scenarios 1 and 5 described in [RFC6144].  Hence, the scenario of\n \
    \  servers moving to IPv6 while clients remaining IPv4 remains\n   unaddressed.\
    \  Of course, IPv6-to-IPv4 communications can also be\n   supported if static\
    \ or explicit bindings (e.g., [RFC6887]) are\n   configured on the stateful NAT64.\n\
    \   Stateful 64, just like any other technique under development, has\n   some\
    \ positives and some drawbacks.  The ups and downs of the proposal\n   must be\
    \ clearly understood while going forward with its future\n   development.\n  \
    \ The scope of this document does not include stateless translation.\n"
- title: 2.  Analysis of 64 Translation against Concerns of RFC 4966
  contents:
  - "2.  Analysis of 64 Translation against Concerns of RFC 4966\n   Of the set of\
    \ problems pointed out in [RFC4966], the stateful 64\n   addresses some of them,\
    \ whereas it leaves others unaddressed.\n   Some issues mentioned in [RFC4966]\
    \ were solved by [RFC4787],\n   [RFC5382], and [RFC5508].  At the time when NAT-PT\
    \ was published,\n   these recommendations were not in place but they are orthogonal\
    \ to\n   the translation algorithm per se; therefore, they could be\n   implemented\
    \ with NAT-PT.  On the other hand, NAT64 [RFC6146]\n   explicitly mentions that\
    \ these recommendations need to be followed\n   and thus should be seen as a complete\
    \ specification.\n   It is also worth pointing out that the scope of the stateful\
    \ 64 is\n   reduced when compared to NAT-PT.  Following is a point-by-point\n\
    \   analysis of the problems.  This document classifies the issues listed\n  \
    \ in [RFC4966] into three categories:\n   1.  Problems impossible to solve.\n\
    \   2.  Problems that can be solved.\n   3.  Problems solved.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Problems Impossible to Solve
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Problems Impossible to Solve\n   Problems discussed in [RFC4966] that are\
    \ impossible to solve:\n   1.  Inability to redirect traffic for protocols that\
    \ lack de-\n       multiplexing capabilities or are not built on top of specific\n\
    \       transport-layer protocols for transport address translations\n       (Section\
    \ 2.2 of [RFC4966]).\n          Analysis: This issue is not specific to 64 but\
    \ to all NAT-\n          based solutions.\n   2.  Loss of information due to incompatible\
    \ semantics between IPv4\n       and IPv6 versions of headers and protocols (Section\
    \ 2.4 of\n       [RFC4966]).\n          Analysis: This issue is not specific to\
    \ 64 but is due to the\n          design of IPv4 and IPv6.\n   3.  Need for the\
    \ NAT64-capable device to act as proxy for\n       correspondent node when IPv6\
    \ node is mobile, with consequent\n       restrictions on mobility (Section 2.7\
    \ of [RFC4966]).\n          Analysis: This is not specific to NAT64 but to all\
    \ NAT\n          flavors.  Refer to [NAT64-HARMFUL] for an early analysis on\n\
    \          mobility complications encountered when NAT64 is involved.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Problems That Can Be Solved
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Problems That Can Be Solved\n   Problems discussed in [RFC4966] that can\
    \ be solved:\n   1.  Disruption of all protocols that embed IP addresses (and/or\n\
    \       ports) in packet payloads or apply integrity mechanisms using IP\n   \
    \    addresses (and ports) (Section 2.1 of [RFC4966]).\n          Analysis: In\
    \ the case of FTP [RFC0959], this problem can be\n          mitigated in several\
    \ ways (e.g., use a FTP64 Application Layer\n          Gateway (ALG) [RFC6384]\
    \ or in the FTP client (e.g., [FTP64])).\n          In the case of SIP [RFC3261],\
    \ no specific issue is induced by\n          64; the same techniques for NAT traversal\
    \ can be used when a\n          NAT64 is involved in the path (e.g., Interactive\
    \ Connectivity\n          Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245], maintain SIP-related\
    \ NAT\n          bindings as per Section 3.4 of [RFC5853], media latching\n  \
    \        [MIDDLEBOXES], embedded SIP ALGs, etc.).  [RFC6157] provides\n      \
    \    more discussion on how to establish SIP sessions between IPv4\n         \
    \ and IPv6 SIP user agents.\n          The functioning of other protocols is left\
    \ for future study.\n          Note that the traversal of NAT64 by application\
    \ embedding IP\n          address literal is not specific to NAT64 but generic\
    \ to all\n          NAT-based solutions.\n   2.  Interaction with Stream Control\
    \ Transmission Protocol (SCTP)\n       [RFC4960] and multihoming (Section 2.6\
    \ of [RFC4966]).\n          Analysis: Only TCP and UDP transport protocols are\
    \ within the\n          scope of NAT64 [RFC6146].  SCTP is out of scope of this\n\
    \          document.\n   3.  Inability to handle multicast traffic (Section 2.8\
    \ of [RFC4966]).\n          Analysis: This problem is not addressed by the current\
    \ 64\n          specifications.\n   4.  Scalability concerns together with introduction\
    \ of a single point\n       of failure and a security attack nexus (Section 3.2\
    \ of\n       [RFC4966]).\n          Analysis: This is not specific to NAT64 but\
    \ to all stateful\n          NAT flavors.  The presence of a single point of failure\
    \ is\n          deployment-specific; some service providers may deploy state\n\
    \          synchronization means while others may only rely on a\n          distributed\
    \ NAT64 model.\n   5.  Restricted validity of translated DNS records: a translated\n\
    \       record may be forwarded to an application that cannot use it\n       (Section\
    \ 4.2 of [RFC4966]).\n          Analysis: If a node on the IPv4 side forwards\
    \ the address of\n          the other endpoint to a node that cannot reach the\
    \ NAT box or\n          is not covered under the endpoint-independent constraint\
    \ of\n          NAT, then the new node will not be able to initiate a\n      \
    \    successful session.\n          Actually, this is not a limitation of 64 (or\
    \ even NAT-PT) but\n          a deployment context where IPv4 addresses managed\
    \ by the NAT64\n          are not globally reachable.  The same limitation can\
    \ be\n          encountered when referrals (even without any NAT in the path)\n\
    \          include reachability information with limited reachability\n      \
    \    scope (see [REFERRAL] for more discussion about issues related\n        \
    \  to reachability scope).\n   6.  IPsec traffic using AH (Authentication Header)\
    \ [RFC4302] in both\n       transport and tunnel modes cannot be carried through\
    \ NAT-PT\n       without terminating the security associations on the NAT-PT,\
    \ due\n       to the inclusion of IP header fields in the scope of AH's\n    \
    \   cryptographic integrity protection [RFC3715] (Section 2.1 of\n       [RFC4966]).\
    \  In addition, IPsec traffic using ESP (Encapsulating\n       Security Payload)\
    \ [RFC4303] in transport mode generally uses UDP\n       encapsulation [RFC3948]\
    \ for NAT traversal (including NAT-PT\n       traversal) in order to avoid the\
    \ problems described in [RFC3715]\n       (Section 2.1 of [RFC4966]).\n      \
    \    Analysis: This is not specific to NAT64 but to all NAT\n          flavors.\n\
    \   7.  Address selection issues when either the internal or external\n      \
    \ hosts implement both IPv4 and IPv6 (Section 4.1 of [RFC4966]).\n          Analysis:\
    \ This is out of scope of 64 since Scenarios 1 and 5\n          of [RFC6144] assume\
    \ IPv6-only hosts.\n          Therefore, this issue is not resolved and mitigation\n\
    \          techniques outside the 64 need to be used (e.g.,\n          [ADDR-SELECT]).\
    \  These techniques may allow one to offload\n          NAT64 resources and prefer\
    \ native communications that do not\n          involve address family translation.\
    \  Avoiding NAT devices in\n          the path is encouraged for mobile nodes\
    \ in order to save power\n          consumption due to keepalive messages that\
    \ are required to\n          maintain NAT states (\"always-on\" services).  An\
    \ in-depth\n          discussion can be found in [DNS64].\n"
- title: 2.3.  Problems Solved
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Problems Solved\n   Problems identified in [RFC4966] that have been solved:\n\
    \   1.  Constraints on network topology (as it relates to DNS-ALG; see\n     \
    \  Section 3.1 of [RFC4966]).\n          Analysis: The severity of this issue\
    \ has been mitigated by the\n          separation of the DNS from the NAT functionality.\n\
    \          Nevertheless, a minimal coordination may be required to ensure\n  \
    \        that the NAT64 to be crossed (the one to which the IPv4-\n          Converted\
    \ IPv6 address returned to a requesting host) must be\n          in the path and\
    \ has also sufficient resources to handle\n          received traffic.\n   2.\
    \  Need for additional state and/or packet reconstruction in dealing\n       with\
    \ packet fragmentation.  Otherwise, implement no support for\n       fragments\
    \ (Section 2.5 of [RFC4966]).\n          Analysis: This issue is not specific\
    \ to 64 but to all NAT-\n          based solutions.  [RFC6146] specifies how to\
    \ handle\n          fragmentation; appropriate recommendations to avoid\n    \
    \      fragmentation-related DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks are\n          proposed\
    \ (e.g., limit resources to be dedicated to out-of-\n          order fragments).\n\
    \   3.  Inappropriate translation of responses to A queries from IPv6\n      \
    \ nodes (Section 4.3 of [RFC4966]).\n          Analysis: DNS64 [RFC6147] does\
    \ not alter A queries.\n   4.  Address selection issues and resource consumption\
    \ in a DNS-ALG\n       with multi-addressed nodes (Section 4.4 of [RFC4966]).\n\
    \          Analysis: Since no DNS-ALG is required to be co-located with\n    \
    \      NAT64, there is no need to maintain temporary states in\n          anticipation\
    \ of connections.  Note that explicit bindings (see\n          Section 3 of [RFC6887])\
    \ are required to allow for\n          communications initiated from an IPv4-only\
    \ client to an IPv6-\n          only server.\n   5.  Limitations on DNS security\
    \ capabilities when using a DNS-ALG\n       (Section 2.5 of [RFC4966]).\n    \
    \      Analysis: A DNSSEC validating stub resolver behind a DNS64 in\n       \
    \   server mode is not supported.  Therefore, if a host wants to\n          do\
    \ its own DNSSEC validation, and it wants to use a NAT64, the\n          host\
    \ has to also perform its own DNS64 synthesis.  Refer to\n          Section 3\
    \ of [RFC6147] for more details.\n   6.  Creation of a DoS threat relating to\
    \ exhaustion of memory and\n       address/port pool resources on the translator\
    \ (Section 3.4 of\n       [RFC4966]).\n          Analysis: This specific DoS concern\
    \ on Page 6 of [RFC4966] is\n          under a DNS-ALG heading in that document,\
    \ and refers to NAT-\n          PT's creation of NAT mapping state when a DNS\
    \ query occurred.\n          With the new IPv6-IPv4 translation mechanisms, DNS\
    \ queries do\n          not create any mapping state in the NAT64.\n         \
    \ To mitigate the exhaustion of port pool issue (Section 3.4 of\n          [RFC4966]),\
    \ 64 must enforce a port limit similar to the one\n          defined in [RFC6888].\n\
    \          Thus, this concern can be fully eliminated in 64.\n   7.  Requirement\
    \ for applications to use keepalive mechanisms to work\n       around connectivity\
    \ issues caused by premature timeout for\n       session table and Binding Information\
    \ Base entries (Section 2.3\n       of [RFC4966]).\n          Analysis: Since\
    \ NAT64 follows some of the [RFC4787],\n          [RFC5382], and [RFC5508] requirements,\
    \ there is a high lower\n          bound for the lifetime of sessions.  In NAT-PT,\
    \ this was\n          unknown and applications needed to assume the worst case.\
    \  For\n          instance, in NAT64, the lifetime for a TCP session is\n    \
    \      approximately two hours, so not much keepalive signaling\n          overhead\
    \ is needed.\n          Application clients (e.g., VPN clients) are not aware\
    \ of the\n          timer configured in the NAT device.  For unmanaged services,\
    \ a\n          conservative approach would be adopted by applications that\n \
    \         issue frequent keepalive messages to be sure that an active\n      \
    \    mapping is still maintained by any involved NAT64 device even\n         \
    \ if the NAT64 complies with [RFC4787], [RFC5382], and\n          [RFC5508].\n\
    \          Note that keepalive messages may be issued by applications to\n   \
    \       ensure that an active entry is maintained by a firewall, with\n      \
    \    or without a NAT in the path, which is located in the\n          boundaries\
    \ of a local domain.\n   8.  Lack of address mapping persistence: Some applications\
    \ require\n       address retention between sessions.  The user traffic will be\n\
    \       disrupted if a different mapping is used.  The use of the DNS-ALG\n  \
    \     to create address mappings with limited lifetimes means that\n       applications\
    \ must start using the address shortly after the\n       mapping is created, as\
    \ well as keep it alive once they start\n       using it (Section 3.3 of [RFC4966]).\n\
    \          Analysis: In the following, address persistence is used to\n      \
    \    refer to the support of \"IP address pooling\" behavior of\n          \"\
    Paired\" [RFC4787].\n          In the context of 64, the external IPv4 address\
    \ (representing\n          the IPv6 host in the IPv4 network) is assigned by the\
    \ NAT64\n          machinery and not the DNS64 function.  Therefore, address\n\
    \          persistence can be easily ensured by the NAT64 function (which\n  \
    \        complies with NAT recommendations [RFC4787] and [RFC5382]).\n       \
    \   Address persistence should be guaranteed for both dynamic and\n          static\
    \ bindings.\n          In the IPv6 side of the NAT64, the same IPv6 address is\
    \ used\n          to represent an IPv4 host; no issue about address persistence\n\
    \          is raised in an IPv6 network.\n"

    \ to\n   the decoupling of NAT and DNS remain unaddressed.  Some of these\n  \
    \ problems are not specific to 64 but are generic to all NAT-based\n   solutions.\n\
    \   This points to several shortcomings of stateful 64 that must be\n   addressed\
    \ if the future network deployments have to move reliably\n   towards 64 as a\
    \ solution to IPv6-IPv4 interconnection.\n   Some of the issues, as pointed out\
    \ in [RFC4966], have possible\n   solutions.  However these solutions will require\
    \ significant updates\n   to the stateful 64, increasing its complexity.\n   The\
    \ following table summarizes the conclusions based on the analysis\n   of stateful\
    \ 64.\n   +---------------+----------+---------+----------+---------+---------+\n\
