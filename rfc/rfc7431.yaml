- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Different solutions have been developed and deployed to\
    \ improve\n   service guarantees, both for multicast video traffic and Video on\n\
    \   Demand traffic.  Most of these solutions are geared towards finding\n   an\
    \ alternate path around one or more failed network elements (link,\n   node, or\
    \ path failures).\n   This document describes a mechanism for minimizing packet\
    \ loss in a\n   network when node or link failures occur.  Multicast-only Fast\n\
    \   Reroute (MoFRR) works by making simple changes to the way selected\n   routers\
    \ use multicast protocols such as PIM and mLDP.  No changes to\n   the protocols\
    \ themselves are required.  With MoFRR, in many cases,\n   multicast routing protocols\
    \ don't necessarily have to depend on or\n   have to wait on unicast routing protocols\
    \ to detect network failures;\n   see Section 5.\n   On a Merge Point, MoFRR logic\
    \ determines a primary Upstream Multicast\n   Hop (UMH) and a secondary UMH and\
    \ joins the tree via both\n   simultaneously.  Data packets are received over\
    \ the primary and\n   secondary paths.  Only the packets from the primary UMH\
    \ are accepted\n   and forwarded down the tree; the packets from the secondary\
    \ UMH are\n   discarded.  The UMH determination is different for PIM and mLDP\
    \ and\n   explained in Section 4.  When a failure is detected on the path to\n\
    \   the primary UMH, the repair occurs by changing the secondary UMH into\n  \
    \ the primary and the primary into the secondary.  Since the repair is\n   local,\
    \ it is fast -- greatly improving convergence times in the event\n   of node or\
    \ link failures on the path to the primary UMH.\n"

- title: 2.  Basic Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  Basic Overview\n   The basic idea of MoFRR is for a Merge Point router to\
    \ join a\n   multicast tree via two divergent upstream paths in order to get\n\
    \   maximum redundancy.  The determination of this alternate upstream is\n   defined\
    \ in Section 3.\n   In order to maximize robustness against any failure, the two\
    \ paths\n   should be as diverse as possible.  Ideally, they should not merge\n\
    \   upstream.  Sometimes the topology guarantees maximal redundancy;\n   other\
    \ times additional configuration or techniques are needed to\n   enforce it. \
    \ See Section 6 for more discussion on the applicability\n   of MoFRR depending\
    \ on the network topology.\n   A Merge Point router should only accept and forward\
    \ on one of the\n   upstream paths at a time in order to avoid duplicate packet\n\
    \   forwarding.  The selection of the primary and secondary UMH is done\n   by\
    \ the MoFRR logic and normally based on unicast routing to find\n   loop-free\
    \ candidates.  This is described in Section 4.\n   Note, the impact of an additional\
    \ amount of data on the network is\n   mitigated when tree membership is densely\
    \ populated.  When a part of\n   the network has redundant data flowing, join\
    \ latency for new joining\n   members is reduced because it's likely a tree Merge\
    \ Point is not far\n   away.\n"
- title: 3.  Determination of the Secondary UMH
  contents:
  - "3.  Determination of the Secondary UMH\n   The secondary UMH is a Loop-Free Alternate\
    \ (LFA) as per [RFC5286].\n"
- title: 3.1.  ECMP-Mode MoFRR
  contents:
  - "3.1.  ECMP-Mode MoFRR\n   If the IGP installs two ECMP paths to the source, then\
    \ as per\n   [RFC5286] the LFA is a primary next-hop.  If the multicast tree is\n\
    \   enabled for ECMP-mode MoFRR, the router installs the paths as primary\n  \
    \ and secondary UMHs.  Before the failure, only packets received from\n   the\
    \ primary UMH path are processed, while packets received from the\n   secondary\
    \ UMH are dropped.\n   The selected primary UMH SHOULD be the same as if the MoFRR\
    \ extension\n   were not enabled.\n   If more than two ECMP paths exist, one is\
    \ selected as primary and\n   another as secondary UMH.  The selection of the\
    \ primary and secondary\n   is a local decision.  Information from the IGP link-state\
    \ topology\n   could be leveraged to optimize this selection such that the primary\n\
    \   and secondary paths are maximal divergent and don't lead to the same\n   upstream\
    \ node.  Note that MoFRR does not restrict the number of UMH\n   paths that are\
    \ joined.  Implementations may use as many paths as are\n   configured.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Non-ECMP-Mode MoFRR
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Non-ECMP-Mode MoFRR\n   A router X configured for non-ECMP-mode MoFRR for\
    \ a multicast tree\n   joins a primary path to its primary UMH and a secondary\
    \ path to its\n   LFA UMH.  In order to prevent control-plane loops, a router\
    \ MUST stop\n   joining the secondary UMH if this UMH is the only member in the\
    \ OIF\n   list.\n   To illustrate the reason for this rule, let's consider the\
    \ example in\n   Figure 3.  If two Provider Edge routers, PE1 and PE2, have received\n\
    \   an IGMP request for a multicast tree, they will both join the primary\n  \
    \ path on their plane and a secondary path to the neighbor PE.  If\n   their receivers\
    \ leave at the same time, it's possible for the\n   multicast tree on PE1 and\
    \ PE2 to never get deleted, as the PEs\n   refresh each other via the secondary\
    \ path joins (remember that a\n   secondary path join is not distinguishable from\
    \ a primary join).\n"
- title: 4.  Upstream Multicast Hop Selection
  contents:
  - "4.  Upstream Multicast Hop Selection\n   An Upstream Multicast Hop (UMH) is a\
    \ candidate next-hop that can be\n   used to reach the root of the tree.  This\
    \ is normally based on\n   unicast routing to find loop-free candidate(s).  With\
    \ MoFRR\n   procedures, we select a primary and a backup UMH.  The procedures\
    \ for\n   determining the UMH are different for PIM and mLDP.\n"
- title: 4.1.  PIM
  contents:
  - "4.1.  PIM\n   The UMH selection in PIM is also known as the Reverse Path Forwarding\n\
    \   (RPF) procedure.  Based on a unicast route lookup on either the\n   source\
    \ address or Rendezvous Point (RP) [RFC4601], an upstream\n   interface is selected\
    \ for sending the PIM Joins/Prunes AND accepting\n   the multicast packets.  The\
    \ interface the packets are received on is\n   used to pass or fail the RPF check.\
    \  If packets are received on an\n   interface that was not selected as the primary\
    \ by the RPF procedure,\n   the packets are discarded.\n"
- title: 4.2.  mLDP
  contents:
  - "4.2.  mLDP\n   The UMH selection in mLDP also depends on unicast routing, but\
    \ the\n   difference from PIM is that the acceptance of multicast packets is\n\
    \   based on MPLS labels and is independent of the interface on which the\n  \
    \ packet is received.  Using the procedures as defined in [RFC6388], an\n   upstream\
    \ Label Switching Router (LSR) is elected.  The upstream LSR\n   that was elected\
    \ for a Label Switched Path (LSP) gets a unique local\n   MPLS label allocated.\
    \  Multicast packets are only forwarded if the\n   MPLS label matches the MPLS\
    \ label that was allocated for that LSP's\n   (primary) upstream LSR.\n"
- title: 5.  Detecting Failures
  contents:
  - "5.  Detecting Failures\n   Once the two paths are established, the next step\
    \ is detecting a\n   failure on the primary path to know when to switch to the\
    \ backup\n   path.  This is a local issue, but this section explores some\n  \
    \ possibilities.\n   The first (and simplest) option is to detect the failure\
    \ of the local\n   interface as it's done for unicast Fast Reroute.  Detection\
    \ can be\n   performed using the loss of signal or the loss of probing packets\n\
    \   (e.g., BFD).  This option can be used in combination with the other\n   options\
    \ as documented below.  Just like for unicast fast reroute,\n   50 msec switchover\
    \ is possible.\n   A second option consists of comparing the packets received\
    \ on the\n   primary and secondary streams but only forwarding one of them --\
    \ the\n   first one received, no matter which interface it is received on.\n \
    \  Zero packet loss is possible for RTP-based streams.\n   A third option assumes\
    \ a minimum known packet rate for a given data\n   stream.  If a packet is not\
    \ received on the primary RPF within this\n   time frame, the router assumes primary\
    \ path failure and switches to\n   the secondary RPF interface. 50 msec switchover\
    \ may be possible for\n   high-rate streams (e.g., IPTV where SD video has a continuous\
    \ inter-\n   packet gap of about 3 msec), but in general the delay is dependent\
    \ on\n   the rate of the multicast stream.\n   A fourth option leverages the significant\
    \ improvements of the IGP\n   convergence speed.  When the primary path to the\
    \ source is withdrawn\n   by the IGP, the MoFRR-enabled router switches over to\
    \ the backup\n   path, and the UMH is changed to the secondary UMH.  Since the\n\
    \   secondary path is already in place, and assuming it is disjoint from\n   the\
    \ primary path, convergence times would not include the time\n   required to build\
    \ a new tree and hence are smaller.  Sub-second to\n   sub-200 msec switchover\
    \ should be possible.\n"

    \           Figure 1: Two-Plane Network Design\n   The topology has two planes,\
    \ a primary plane and a secondary plane\n   that are fully disjoint from each\
    \ other all the way into the POPs.\n   This two-plane design is common in service\
    \ provider networks as it\n   eliminates single point of failures in their core\
    \ network.  The links\n   marked P indicate the normal (primary) path of how the\
    \ PIM Joins flow\n   from the POPs towards the source of the network.  Multicast\
    \ streams,\n   especially for the densely watched channels, typically flow along\n\
    \   both the planes in the network anyway.\n   The only change MoFRR adds to this\
    \ is on the links marked S where the\n   PE routers join a secondary path to their\
    \ secondary ECMP UMH.  As a\n   result of this, each PE router receives two copies\
    \ of the same\n   stream, one from the primary plane and the other from the secondary\n\
    \   plane.  As a result of normal UMH behavior, the multicast stream\n   received\
    \ over the primary path is accepted and forwarded to the\n   downstream receivers.\
    \  The copy of the stream received from the\n   secondary UMH is discarded.\n\
    \   When a router detects a routing failure on the path to its primary\n   UMH,\
    \ it will switch to the secondary UMH and accept packets for that\n   stream.\
    \  If the failure is repaired, the router may switch back.  The\n   primary and\
    \ secondary UMHs have only local context and not end-to-end\n   context.\n   As\
    \ one can see, MoFRR achieves the faster convergence by pre-building\n   the secondary\
    \ multicast tree and receiving the traffic on that\n   secondary path.  The example\
    \ discussed above is a simple case where\n   there are two ECMP paths from each\
    \ PE device towards the source, one\n   along the primary plane and one along\
    \ the secondary.  In cases where\n   the topology is asymmetric or is a ring,\
    \ this ECMP nature does not\n   hold, and additional rules have to be taken into\
    \ account to choose\n   when and where to join the secondary path.\n   MoFRR is\
    \ appealing in such topologies for the following reasons:\n   1.  Ease of deployment\
    \ and simplicity: the functionality is only\n       required on the PE devices,\
    \ although it may be configured on all\n       routers in the topology.  Furthermore,\
    \ each PE device can be\n       enabled separately; there is no need for network-wide\n\
    \       coordination in order to deploy MoFRR.  Interoperability testing\n   \
    \    is not required as there are no PIM or mLDP protocol changes.\n   2.  End-to-end\
    \ failure detection and recovery: any failure along the\n       path from the\
    \ source to the PE can be detected and repaired with\n       the secondary disjoint\
    \ stream.  (See the second, third, and\n       fourth options in Section 5.)\n\
    \   3.  Capacity efficiency: as illustrated in the previous example, the\n   \
    \    multicast trees corresponding to IPTV channels cover the backbone\n     \
    \  and distribution topology in a very dense manner.  As a\n       consequence,\
    \ the secondary path grafts onto the normal multicast\n       trees (i.e., trees\
    \ signaled by PIM or mLDP without the MoFRR\n       extension) at the aggregation\
    \ level and hence does not demand any\n       extra capacity either on the distribution\
    \ links or in the\n       backbone.  The secondary path simply uses the capacity\
    \ that is\n       normally used, without any duplication.  This is different from\n\
    \       conventional FRR mechanisms that often duplicate the capacity\n      \
    \ requirements when the backup path crosses links/nodes that\n       already carry\
    \ the primary/normal tree, and thus twice as much\n       capacity is required.\n\
    \   4.  Loop-free: the secondary path join is sent on an ECMP disjoint\n     \
    \  path.  By definition, the neighbor receiving this request is\n       closer\
    \ to the source and hence will not cause a loop.\n   The topology we just analyzed\
    \ is very frequent and can be modeled as\n   per Figure 2.  The PE has two ECMP\
    \ disjoint paths to the source.\n   Each ECMP path uses a disjoint plane of the\
    \ network.\n                            Source\n                            /\

    \ There is no ECMP like in Figure 2.  However, there is\n   clearly a way to provide\
    \ MoFRR benefits as each PE can offer a\n   disjoint secondary path to the PE\
    \ in the other plane (via the\n   disjoint path).\n   The MoFRR secondary neighbor\
    \ selection process needs to be extended\n   in this case as one cannot simply\
    \ rely on using an ECMP path as\n   secondary neighbor.  This extension is referred\
    \ to as non-ECMP-mode\n   MoFRR and is described in Section 3.2.\n           \

  - "7.  Other Topologies\n   As mentioned in Section 6, MoFRR works best in dual-plane\
    \ topologies.\n   If MoFRR is applied to non-dual-plane networks, it's possible\
    \ that\n   the secondary path is affected by the same failure that affected the\n\
    \   primary path.  In that case, there is no guarantee that the backup\n   path\
    \ will provide an uninterrupted traffic flow of packets without\n   loss or duplication.\n"

  contents:
  - "8.  Capacity Planning for MoFRR\n   The previous section has described two very\
    \ frequent designs (Figures\n   2 and 3) which provide maximum MoFRR benefits.\n\
    \   Designers with topologies different than Figures 2 and 3 can still\n   benefit\
    \ from MoFRR, thanks to the use of capacity planning tools.\n   Such tools are\
    \ able to simulate the ability of each PE to build two\n   disjoint branches of\
    \ the same tree.  This simulation could be for\n   hundreds of PEs and hundreds\
    \ of sources.\n   This allows an assessment of the MoFRR protection coverage of\
    \ a given\n   network, for a set of sources.\n   If the protection coverage is\
    \ deemed insufficient, the designer can\n   use such a tool to optimize the topology\
    \ (add links, change IGP\n   metrics).\n"
- title: 9.  PE Nodes
  contents:
  - "9.  PE Nodes\n   Many Service Providers devise their topology such that PEs have\n\
    \   disjoint paths to the multicast sources.  MoFRR leverages the\n   existence\
    \ of these disjoint paths without any PIM or mLDP protocol\n   modification. \
    \ Interoperability testing is thus not required.  In\n   such topologies, MoFRR\
    \ only needs to be deployed on the PE devices.\n   Each PE device can be enabled\
    \ one by one.\n"
- title: 10.  Other Applications
  contents:
  - "10.  Other Applications\n   While all the examples in this document show the\
    \ MoFRR applicability\n   on PE devices, it is clear that MoFRR could be enabled\
    \ on aggregation\n   or core routers.\n   MoFRR can be popular in data center\
    \ network configurations.  With the\n   advent of lower-cost Ethernet and increasing\
    \ port density in routers,\n   there is more meshed connectivity than ever before.\
    \  When using a\n   three-level access, distribution, and core layers in a data\
    \ center,\n   there is a lot of inexpensive bandwidth connecting the layers. \
    \ This\n   will lend itself to more opportunities for ECMP paths at multiple\n\
    \   layers.  This allows for multiple layers of redundancy protecting\n   link\
    \ and node failure at each layer with minimal redundancy cost.\n   Redundancy\
    \ costs are reduced because only one packet is forwarded at\n   every link along\
    \ the primary and secondary data paths so there is no\n   duplication of data\
    \ on any link thereby providing make-before-break\n   protection at a very small\
    \ cost.\n   A MoFRR router only accepts packets from the primary path and\n  \
    \ discards packets from the secondary path.  For that reason,\n   management applications\
    \ (like ping and mtrace) will not work when\n   verifying the secondary path.\n\
    \   The MoFRR principle may be applied to MVPNs.\n"
