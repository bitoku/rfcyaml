  - "1.  Introduction\n   Access Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF)
    is being\n   defined in 3GPP [3GPPTS23.402] to provide necessary network discovery\n
    \  and selection assistance data to the mobile nodes for multi-access\n   network
    scenarios where 3GPP access-network level solutions are not\n   sufficient for
    the mobile nodes to perform network discovery and\n   selection of non-3GPP networks.\n
    \  The information provided by ANDSF contains inter-system mobility\n   policies
    and access-network-specific data to assist the mobile node\n   with performing
    the inter-system handover.  This set of information\n   can either be provisioned
    in the mobile node by the home operator or\n   provided to the mobile node (MN)
    dynamically by the ANDSF over the\n   S14 reference point as defined in [3GPPTS23.402]
    and [3GPPTS24.302].\n   In 3GPP, the ANDSF is located either in the subscriber's
    home\n   operator or visited network and needs to be known to the MN or\n   discovered
    by the MN.  According to [3GPPTS23.402] and\n   [3GPPTS24.302], the ANDSF is discovered
    through interaction with the\n   Domain Name Service function or the DHCP server
    function.\n   This document defines new DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 options called the ANDSF\n
    \  IP Address Options, which allow the MN to locate an ANDSF server.\n"

    from a DHCP server or\n   insert its own response, an MN could be led to contact
    a rogue ANDSF\n   server.  A modified response could also be used to mount an\n
    \  amplification attack.\n   The DHCP authentication option described in [RFC3118]
    and [RFC3315]\n   MAY be used to mitigate the above attacks.  In deployments where
    DHCP\n   authentication is not available, 3GPP-specific lower-layer security\n
    \  services can be used to protect DHCP messages [3GPPTS33.402].  The\n   3GPP
    ANDSF framework also provides additional mechanisms that can be\n   used to mitigate
    the above attacks and to protect message exchanges\n   between an ANDSF client
    and server at the higher layer\n   [3GPPTS33.402].\n"
