  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The OpenLDAP Project is operating an experimental LDAP (Lightweight\n\
    \   Directory Access Protocol) referral service known as the \"OpenLDAP\n   Root\
    \ Service\".  The automated system generates referrals based upon\n   service\
    \ location information published in DNS SRV RRs (Domain Name\n   System location\
    \ of services resource records).  This document\n   describes this service.\n"
- title: 1. Background
  contents:
  - "1. Background\n   LDAP [RFC2251] directories use a hierarchical naming scheme\
    \ inherited\n   from X.500 [X500].  Traditionally, X.500 deployments have used\
    \ a\n   geo-political naming scheme (e.g., CN=Jane\n   Doe,OU=Engineering,O=Example,ST=CA,C=US).\
    \  However, registration\n   infrastructure and location services in many portions\
    \ of the naming\n   hierarchical are inadequate or nonexistent.\n   The construction\
    \ of a global directory requires a robust registration\n   infrastructure and\
    \ location service.  Use of Internet domain-based\n   naming [RFC2247] (e.g.,\
    \ UID=jdoe,DC=eng,DC=example,DC=net) allows\n   LDAP directory services to leverage\
    \ the existing DNS [RFC1034]\n   registration infrastructure and DNS SRV [RFC2782]\
    \ resource records\n   can be used to locate services [LOCATE].\n"
- title: 1.1.  The Glue
  contents:
  - "1.1.  The Glue\n   Most existing LDAP implementations do not support location\
    \ of\n   directory services using DNS SRV resource records.  However, most\n \
    \  servers support generation of referrals to \"superior\" server(s).\n   This\
    \ service provides a \"root\" LDAP service which servers may use as\n   their\
    \ superior referral service.\n   Client may also use the service directly to locate\
    \ services\n   associated with an arbitrary Distinguished Name [RFC2253] within\
    \ the\n   domain based hierarchy.\n   Notice:\n     The mechanisms used by service\
    \ are experimental.  The descriptions\n     provided by this document are not\
    \ definitive.  Definitive\n     mechanisms shall be published in a Standard Track\
    \ document(s).\n"

  - "2. Generating Referrals based upon DNS SRV RRs\n   This service returns referrals\
    \ generated from DNS SRV resource\n   records [RFC2782].\n"
- title: 2.1. DN to Domain Name Mapping
  contents:
  - "2.1. DN to Domain Name Mapping\n   The service maps a DN [RFC2253] to a fully\
    \ qualified domain name\n   using the following algorithm:\n       domain = null;\n\
    \       foreach RDN left-to-right        // [1]\n       {\n           if not multi-valued\

    \ incarnation will use a Standard Track mechanism.\n   1) A later incarnation\
    \ of this service may use a right-to-left\n      algorithm.\n   2) RFC 2247 does\
    \ not state how one can map the domain representing\n      the root of the domain\
    \ tree to a DN.  We suggest the root of the\n      domain tree be mapped to \"\
    DC=.\" and that this be reversable.\n   3) RFC 2247 states that domain \"example.net\"\
    \ should be mapped to the\n      DN \"DC=example,DC=net\", not to \"DC=example,DC=net,DC=.\"\
    .  As it is\n      not our intent to introduce or support an alternative domain\
    \ to DN\n      mapping, the algorithm ignores domainComponents to the left of\n\
    \      \"DC=.\".\n   4) RFC 2247 states that domain \"example.net\" should be\
    \ mapped to the\n      DN \"DC=example,DC=net\", not to \"DC=example,DC=.,DC=net\"\
    .  As it is\n      not our intent to introduce or support an alternative domain\
    \ to DN\n      mapping, the algorithm ignores domainComponents to the left of\n\
    \      \"DC=.\" and \"DC=.\" itself if further domainComponents are found to\n\
    \      the right.\n   5) RFC 2247 states that value of an DC attribute type is\
    \ a domain\n      component.  It should not contain multiple domain components.\
    \  A\n      later incarnation of this service may map this domain to null or\n\
    \      be coded to return invalid DN error.\n   If the domain is null or \".\"\
    , the service aborts further processing\n   and returns noSuchObject.  Later incarnation\
    \ of this service may\n   abort processing if the resulting domain is a top-level\
    \ domain.\n"
- title: 2.2. Locating LDAP services
  contents:
  - "2.2. Locating LDAP services\n   The root service locates services associated\
    \ with a given fully\n   qualified domain name by querying the Domain Name System\
    \ for LDAP SRV\n   resource records.  For the domain example.net, the service\
    \ would do a\n   issue a SRV query for the domain \"_ldap._tcp.example.net\".\
    \  A\n   successful query will return one or more resource records of the\n  \
    \ form:\n     _ldap._tcp.example.net. IN SRV 0 0 389 ldap.example.net.\n   If\
    \ no LDAP SRV resource records are returned or any DNS error occurs,\n   the service\
    \ aborts further processing and returns noSuchObject.\n   Later incarnations of\
    \ this service will better handle transient\n   errors.\n"
- title: 2.3. Constructing an LDAP Referrals
  contents:
  - "2.3. Constructing an LDAP Referrals\n   For each DNS SRV resource record returned\
    \ for the domain, a LDAP URL\n   [RFC2255] is constructed.  For the above resource\
    \ record, the URL\n   would be:\n     ldap://ldap.example.net:389/\n   These URLs\
    \ are then returned in the referral.  The URLs are currently\n   returned in resolver\
    \ order.  That is, the server itself does not make\n   use of priority or weight\
    \ information in the SRV resource records.  A\n   later incarnation of this service\
    \ may.\n"
- title: 3. Protocol Operations
  contents:
  - "3. Protocol Operations\n   This section describes how the service performs basic\
    \ LDAP\n   operations.  The service supports operations extended through certain\n\
    \   controls as described in a later section.\n"
- title: 3.1. Basic Operations
  contents:
  - "3.1. Basic Operations\n   Basic (add, compare, delete, modify, rename, search)\
    \ operations\n   return a referral result if the target (or base) DN can be mapped\
    \ to\n   a set of LDAP URLs as described above.  Otherwise a noSuchObject\n  \
    \ response or other appropriate response is returned.\n"
- title: 3.2. Bind Operation
  contents:
  - "3.2. Bind Operation\n   The service accepts \"anonymous\" bind specifying version\
    \ 2 or version\n   3 of the protocol.  All other bind requests will return a non-\n\
    \   successful resultCode.  In particular, clients which submit clear\n   text\
    \ credentials will be sent an unwillingToPerform resultCode with a\n   cautionary\
    \ text regarding providing passwords to strangers.\n   As this service is read-only,\
    \ LDAPv3 authentication [RFC2829] is not\n   supported.\n"
- title: 3.3. Unbind Operations
  contents:
  - "3.3. Unbind Operations\n   Upon receipt of an unbind request, the server abandons\
    \ all\n   outstanding requests made by client and disconnects.\n"
- title: 3.4. Extended Operations
  contents:
  - "3.4. Extended Operations\n   The service currently does recognize any extended\
    \ operation.  Later\n   incarnations of the service may support Start TLS [RFC2830]\
    \ and other\n   operations.\n"
- title: 3.5. Update Operations
  contents:
  - "3.5. Update Operations\n   A later incarnation of this service may return unwillingToPerform\
    \ for\n   all update operations as this is an unauthenticated service.\n"
- title: 4. Controls
  contents:
  - "4. Controls\n   The service supports the ManageDSAit control.  Unsupported controls\n\
    \   are serviced per RFC 2251.\n"
- title: 4.1. ManageDSAit Control
  contents:
  - "4.1. ManageDSAit Control\n   The server recognizes and honors the ManageDSAit\
    \ control [NAMEDREF]\n   provided with operations.\n   If DNS location information\
    \ is available for the base DN itself, the\n   service will return unwillingToPerform\
    \ for non-search operations.\n   For search operations, an entry will be returned\
    \ if within scope and\n   matches the provided filter.  For example:\n       c:\
    \ searchRequest {\n           base=\"DC=example,DC=net\"\n           scope=base\n\
    \           filter=(objectClass=*)\n           ManageDSAit\n       }\n       s:\
    \ searchEntry {\n           dn: DC=example,DC=net\n           objectClass: referral\n\
    \           objectClass: extensibleObject\n           dc: example\n          \
    \ ref: ldap://ldap.example.net:389/\n           associatedDomain: example.net\n\
    \       }\n       s: searchResult {\n           success\n       }\n   If DNS location\
    \ information is available for the DC portion of a\n   subordinate entry, the\
    \ service will return noSuchObject with the\n   matchedDN set to the DC portion\
    \ of the base for search and update\n   operations.\n       c: searchRequest {\n\
    \           base=\"CN=subordinate,DC=example,DC=net\"\n           scope=base\n\
    \           filter=(objectClass=*)\n           ManageDSAit\n       }\n       s:\
    \ searchResult {\n           noSuchObject\n           matchedDN=\"DC=example,DC=net\"\
    \n       }\n"
- title: 5. Using the Service
  contents:
  - "5. Using the Service\n   Servers may be configured to refer superior requests\
    \ to\n   <ldap://root.openldap.org:389>.\n   Though clients may use the service\
    \ directly, this is not encouraged.\n   Clients should use a local service and\
    \ only use this service when\n   referred to it.\n   The service supports LDAPv3\
    \ and LDAPv2+ [LDAPv2+] clients over\n   TCP/IPv4.  Future incarnations of this\
    \ service may support TCP/IPv6\n   or other transport/internet protocols.\n"

- title: 6.1. Scaling / Reliability
  contents:
  - "6.1. Scaling / Reliability\n   This service currently runs on a single host.\
    \  This host and\n   associated network resources are not yet exhausted.  If they\
    \ do\n   become exhausted, we believe we can easily scale to meet the demand\n\
    \   through common distributed load balancing technics.  The service can\n   also\
    \ easily be duplicated locally.\n"
- title: 6.2. Protocol interoperability
  contents:
  - "6.2. Protocol interoperability\n   This service has able avoided known interoperability\

- title: 6.2.1. LDAPv3
  contents:
  - "6.2.1. LDAPv3\n   The server implements all features of LDAPv3 [RFC2251] necessary\
    \ to\n   provide the service.\n"
- title: 6.2.2. LDAPv2
  contents:
  - "6.2.2. LDAPv2\n   LDAPv2 [RFC1777] does not support the return of referrals and\
    \ hence\n   may not be referred to this service.  Though a LDAPv2 client could\n\
    \   connect and issue requests to this service, the client would treat\n   any\
    \ referral returned to it as an unknown error.\n"
- title: 6.2.3. LDAPv2+
  contents:
  - "6.2.3. LDAPv2+\n   LDAPv2+ [LDAPv2+] provides a number of extensions to LDAPv2,\n\
    \   including referrals.  LDAPv2+, like LDAPv3, does not require a bind\n   operation\
    \ before issuing of other operations.  As the referral\n   representation differ\
    \ between LDAPv2+ and LDAPv3, the service returns\n   LDAPv3 referrals in this\
    \ case.  However, as commonly deployed LDAPv2+\n   clients issue bind requests\
    \ (for compatibility with LDAPv2 servers),\n   this has not generated any interoperability\
    \ issues (yet).\n   A future incarnation of this service may drop support for\
    \ LDAPv2+\n   (and LDAPv2).\n"

    \ hence is\n   not supported.\n"
- title: 7. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7. Security Considerations\n   This service provides information to \"anonymous\"\
    \ clients.  This\n   information is derived from the public directories, namely\
    \ the Domain\n   Name System.\n   The use of authentication would require clients\
    \ to disclose\n   information to the service.  This would be an unnecessary invasion\
    \ of\n   privacy.\n   The lack of encryption allows eavesdropping upon client\
    \ requests and\n   responses.  A later incarnation of this service may support\n\
    \   encryption (such as via Start TLS [RFC2830]).\n   Information integrity protection\
    \ is not provided by the service.  The\n   service is subject to varies forms\
    \ of DNS spoofing and attacks.  LDAP\n   session or operation integrity would\
    \ provide false sense of security\n   concerning the integrity of DNS information.\
    \  A later incarnation of\n   this service may support DNSSEC and provide integrity\
    \ protection (via\n   SASL, TLS, or IPSEC).\n   The service is subject to a variety\
    \ of denial of service attacks.\n   The service is capable of blocking access\
    \ by a number of factors.\n   This capability have yet to be used and likely would\
    \ be ineffective\n   in preventing sophisticated attacks.  Later incarnations\
    \ of this\n   service will likely need better protection from such attacks.\n"
- title: 8. Conclusions
  contents:
  - "8. Conclusions\n   DNS is good glue.  By leveraging of the Domain Name System,\
    \ global\n   LDAP directories may be built without requiring a protocol specific\n\
    \   registration infrastructures.\n   In addition, use of DNS service location\
    \ allows global directories to\n   be built \"ad hoc\".  That is, anyone with\
    \ a domain name can\n   participate.  There is no requirement that the superior\
    \ domain\n   participate.\n"
