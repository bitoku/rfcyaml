- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Over a decade ago, IANA reserved the last Autonomous System\
    \ Number\n   (ASN) of the 16-bit ASN range, 65535, with the intention that it\
    \ not\n   be used by network operators running BGP [RFC4271].  Since the\n   introduction\
    \ of \"BGP Support for Four-Octet Autonomous System (AS)\n   Number Space\" [RFC6793],\
    \ IANA has also reserved the last ASN of the\n   32-bit autonomous system number\
    \ range, 4294967295.  This reservation\n   has been documented in the IANA \"\
    Autonomous System (AS) Numbers\"\n   registry [IANA.AS].  Although these \"Last\
    \ ASNs\" border on Private Use\n   ASN [RFC6996] ranges, they are not defined\
    \ or reserved as Private Use\n   ASNs by [IANA.AS].  This document describes the\
    \ reasoning for\n   reserving Last ASNs and provides guidance both to operators\
    \ and to\n   implementers on their use.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Reasons for Reservation of the Last ASNs
  contents:
  - "3.  Reasons for Reservation of the Last ASNs\n   A subset of the BGP communities\
    \ of ASN 65535, the last ASN of the\n   16-bit range, are reserved for use by\
    \ Well-known Communities as\n   described in [RFC1997] and [IANA.WK].  Although\
    \ this is not currently\n   true of ASN 4294967295, if there is a future need\
    \ for another Special\n   Use ASN that is not designed to be globally routable,\
    \ or for the\n   associated BGP communities of such an ASN, ASN 4294967295 could\
    \ be a\n   valid candidate for such purpose.  This document does not prescribe\n\
    \   any such Special Use to this ASN at the time of publication.\n"
- title: 4.  Operational Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Operational Considerations\n   Operators SHOULD NOT use these Last ASNs for\
    \ any other purpose or as\n   Private Use ASNs.  Operational use of these Last\
    \ ASNs could have\n   undesirable results.  For example; use of AS 65535 as if\
    \ it were a\n   Private Use ASN, may result in inadvertent use of BGP Well-known\n\
    \   Community values [IANA.WK], causing undesirable routing behavior.\n   Last\
    \ ASNs MUST NOT be advertised to the global Internet within\n   AS_PATH or AS4_PATH\
    \ attributes.  Operators SHOULD filter Last ASNs\n   within the AS_PATH and AS4_PATH\
    \ attributes.\n"
- title: 5.  Implementation Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Implementation Considerations\n   While Last ASNs are reserved, they remain\
    \ valid ASNs from a BGP\n   perspective.  Therefore, implementations of BGP [RFC4271]\
    \ SHOULD NOT\n   treat the use of Last ASNs as any type of protocol error.  However,\n\
    \   if a Last ASN is configured as the local AS, implementations MAY\n   generate\
    \ a warning message indicating improper use of a reserved ASN.\n   Implementations\
    \ that provide tools that filter Private Use ASNs\n   within the AS_PATH and AS4_PATH\
    \ attributes MAY also include Last\n   ASNs.\n"
- title: 6.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has reserved last Autonomous System number 65535\
    \ from the\n   \"16-bit Autonomous System Numbers\" registry for the reasons described\n\
    \   in this document.\n   IANA has also reserved last Autonomous System number\
    \ 4294967295 from\n   the \"32-bit Autonomous System Numbers\" registry for the\
    \ reasons\n   described in this document.\n   These reservations have been documented\
    \ in the IANA \"Autonomous\n   System (AS) Numbers\" registry [IANA.AS] and the\
    \ IANA \"Special-Purpose\n   Autonomous System (AS) Numbers\" registry [IANA.SpecialAS].\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not introduce any additional\
    \ security concerns in\n   regards to usage of Last ASNs.  Although the BGP is\
    \ designed to allow\n   usage of Last ASNs, security issues related to BGP implementation\n\
    \   errors could be triggered by Last ASN usage.\n"
