- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The required and suggested algorithms in the original Internet Key\n\
    \   Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) specification do not reflect the current\n   reality\
    \ of the IPsec market requirements.  The original specification\n   allows weak\
    \ security and suggests algorithms that are thinly\n   implemented.  This document\
    \ updates RFC 2409, the original\n   specification, and is intended for all IKEv1\
    \ implementations deployed\n   today.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The original IKEv1 definition, [RFC2409], has a set of MUST-level\
    \ and\n   SHOULD-level requirements that do not match the needs of IPsec users.\n\
    \   This document updates RFC 2409 by changing the algorithm requirements\n  \
    \ defined there.\n   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT,\
    \ SHOULD,\n   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in\
    \ this\n   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Old Algorithm Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  Old Algorithm Requirements\n   RFC 2409 has the following MUST-level and\
    \ SHOULD-level requirements:\n   o  DES for encryption MUST be supported.\n  \
    \ o  MD5 and SHA-1 for hashing and HMAC functions MUST be supported.\n   o  Pre-shared\
    \ secrets for authentication MUST be supported.\n   o  Diffie-Hellman MODP group\
    \ 1 (discrete log 768 bits) MUST be\n      supported.\n   o  TripleDES for encryption\
    \ SHOULD be supported.\n   o  Tiger for hashing SHOULD be supported.\n   o  DSA\
    \ and RSA for authentication with signatures SHOULD be\n      supported.\n   o\
    \  RSA for authentication with encryption SHOULD be supported.\n   o  Diffie-Hellman\
    \ MODP group 2 (discrete log 1024 bits) SHOULD be\n      supported.\n   RFC 2409\
    \ gives two conflicting requirement levels for Diffie-Hellman\n   MODP groups\
    \ with elliptic curves.  Section 4 of that specification\n   says that \"IKE implementations\
    \ ... MAY support ECP and EC2N groups\",\n   but Sections 6.3 and 6.4 say that\
    \ MODP groups 3 and 4 for EC2N groups\n   SHOULD be supported.\n"
- title: 3.  New Algorithm Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  New Algorithm Requirements\n   The new requirements for IKEv1 are listed\
    \ here.  Note that some of\n   the requirements are the same as those in RFC 2409,\
    \ whereas others\n   are changed.\n   o  TripleDES for encryption MUST be supported.\n\
    \   o  AES-128 in CBC mode [RFC3602] for encryption SHOULD be supported.\n   o\
    \  SHA-1 for hashing and HMAC functions MUST be supported.\n   o  Pre-shared secrets\
    \ for authentication MUST be supported.\n   o  AES-128 in XCBC mode for PRF functions\
    \ ([RFC3566] and [RFC3664])\n      SHOULD be supported.\n   o  Diffie-Hellman\
    \ MODP group 2 (discrete log 1024 bits) MUST be\n      supported.\n   o  Diffie-Hellman\
    \ MODP group 14 (discrete log 2048 bits) [RFC3526]\n      SHOULD be supported.\n\
    \   o  RSA for authentication with signatures SHOULD be supported.\n   If additional\
    \ updates are made to IKEv1 in the future, then it is\n   very likely that implementation\
    \ of AES-128 in CBC mode for encryption\n   will become mandatory.\n   The other\
    \ algorithms that were listed at MUST-level and SHOULD-level\n   in RFC 2409 are\
    \ now MAY-level.  This includes DES for encryption, MD5\n   and Tiger for hashing,\
    \ Diffie-Hellman MODP group 1, Diffie-Hellman\n   MODP groups with elliptic curves,\
    \ DSA for authentication with\n   signatures, and RSA for authentication with\
    \ encryption.\n   DES for encryption, MD5 for hashing, and Diffie-Hellman MODP\
    \ group 1\n   are dropped to MAY due to cryptographic weakness.\n   Tiger for\
    \ hashing, Diffie-Hellman MODP groups with elliptic curves,\n   DSA for authentication\
    \ with signatures, and RSA for authentication\n   with encryption are dropped\
    \ due to lack of any significant deployment\n   and interoperability.\n"
