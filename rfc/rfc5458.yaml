  - "1.  Introduction\n   The MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) has been widely accepted\
    \ not only\n   for providing digital TV services, but also as a subnetwork\n \
    \  technology for building IP networks.  RFC 4326 [RFC4326] describes\n   the\
    \ Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) mechanism for the\n   transport\
    \ of IPv4 and IPv6 Datagrams and other network protocol\n   packets directly over\
    \ the ISO MPEG-2 Transport Stream as TS Private\n   Data.  ULE specifies a base\
    \ encapsulation format and supports an\n   Extension Header format that allows\
    \ it to carry additional header\n   information to assist in network/Receiver\
    \ processing.  The\n   encapsulation satisfies the design and architectural requirement\
    \ for\n   a lightweight encapsulation defined in RFC 4259 [RFC4259].\n   Section\
    \ 3.1 of RFC 4259 presents several topological scenarios for\n   MPEG-2 Transmission\
    \ Networks.  A summary of these scenarios is\n   presented below:\n   A. Broadcast\
    \ TV and Radio Delivery.  This is not within the scope of\n      this document.\n\
    \   B. Broadcast Networks used as an ISP.  This resembles scenario A, but\n  \
    \    includes IP services to access the public Internet.\n   C. Unidirectional\
    \ Star IP Scenario.  This provides a data network\n      delivering a common bit\
    \ stream to typically medium-sized groups of\n      Receivers.\n   D. Datacast\
    \ Overlay.  This employs MPEG-2 physical and link layers to\n      provide additional\
    \ connectivity such as unidirectional multicast\n      to supplement an existing\
    \ IP-based Internet service.\n   E. Point-to-Point Links.  This connectivity may\
    \ be provided using a\n      pair of transmit and receive interfaces.\n   F. Two-Way\
    \ IP Networks.\n   RFC 4259 states that ULE must be robust to errors and security\n\
    \   threats.  Security must also consider both unidirectional (A, B, C,\n   and\
    \ D) as well as bidirectional (E and F) links for the scenarios\n   mentioned\
    \ above.\n   An initial analysis of the security requirements in MPEG-2\n   transmission\
    \ networks is presented in the \"Security Considerations\"\n   section of RFC\
    \ 4259.  For example, when such networks are not using a\n   wireline network,\
    \ the normal security issues relating to the use of\n   wireless links for transport\
    \ of Internet traffic should be considered\n   [RFC3819].\n   The security considerations\
    \ of RFC 4259 recommend that any new\n   encapsulation defined by the IETF should\
    \ allow Transport Stream\n   encryption and should also support optional link-layer\
    \ authentication\n   of the Subnetwork Data Unit (SNDU) payload.  In ULE [RFC4326],\
    \ it is\n   suggested that this may be provided in a flexible way using Extension\n\
    \   Headers.  This requires the definition of a mandatory Extension\n   Header,\
    \ but has the advantage that it decouples specification of the\n   security functions\
    \ from the encapsulation functions.\n   This document extends the above analysis\
    \ and derives in detail the\n   security requirements for ULE in MPEG-2 transmission\
    \ networks.\n   A security framework for deployment of secure ULE networks describing\n\
    \   the different building blocks and the interface definitions is\n   presented\
    \ in Appendix A.\n"

    \     Figure 1: An example configuration for a unidirectional service\n      \
    \    for IP transport over MPEG-2 (adapted from [RFC4259])\n   As shown in Figure\
    \ 1 above (from Section 3.3 of [RFC4259]), there are\n   several entities within\
    \ the MPEG-2 transmission network architecture.\n   These include:\n   o ULE Encapsulation\
    \ Gateways (the ULE Encapsulator)\n   o SI-Table signalling generator (input to\
    \ the multiplexer)\n   o Receivers (the endpoints for ULE Streams)\n   o TS multiplexers\
    \ (including re-multiplexers)\n   o Modulators\n   The TS Packets are carried\
    \ to the Receiver over a physical layer that\n   usually includes Forward Error\
    \ Correction (FEC) coding that\n   interleaves the bytes of several consecutive,\
    \ but unrelated, TS\n   Packets.  FEC-coding and synchronisation processing makes\
    \ injection\n   of single TS Packets very difficult.  Replacement of a sequence\
    \ of\n   packets is also difficult, but possible (see Section 3.2).\n   A Receiver\
    \ in an MPEG-2 TS transmission network needs to identify a\n   TS Logical Channel\
    \ (or MPEG-2 Elementary Stream) to reassemble the\n   fragments of PDUs sent by\
    \ an L2 source [RFC4259].  In an MPEG-2 TS,\n   this association is made via the\
    \ Packet Identifier, PID [ISO-MPEG2].\n   At the sender, each source associates\
    \ a locally unique set of PID\n   values with each stream it originates.  However,\
    \ there is no required\n   relationship between the PID value used at the sender\
    \ and that\n   received at the Receiver.  Network devices may re-number the PID\n\
    \   values associated with one or more TS Logical Channels (e.g., ULE\n   Streams)\
    \ to prevent clashes at a multiplexer between input streams\n   with the same\
    \ PID carried on different input multiplexes (updating\n   entries in the PMT\
    \ [ISO-MPEG2], and other SI tables that reference\n   the PID value).  A device\
    \ may also modify and/or insert new SI data\n   into the control plane (also sent\
    \ as TS Packets identified by their\n   PID value).  However, there is only one\
    \ valid source of data for each\n   MPEG-2 Elementary Stream, bound to a PID value.\
    \  (This observation\n   could simplify the requirement for authentication of\
    \ the source of a\n   ULE Stream.)\n   In an MPEG-2 network, a set of signalling\
    \ messages [RFC4947] may need\n   to be broadcast (e.g., by an Encapsulation Gateway\
    \ or other device)\n   to form the L2 control plane.  Examples of signalling messages\n\
    \   include the Program Association Table (PAT), Program Map Table (PMT),\n  \
    \ and Network Information Table (NIT).  In existing MPEG-2 transmission\n   networks,\
    \ these messages are broadcast in the clear (no encryption or\n   integrity checks).\
    \  The integrity as well as authenticity of these\n   messages is important for\
    \ correct working of the ULE network, i.e.,\n   supporting its security objectives\
    \ in the area of availability, in\n   addition to confidentiality and integrity.\
    \  One method recently\n   proposed [RFC5163] encapsulates these messages using\
    \ ULE.  In such\n   cases all the security requirements of this document apply\
    \ in\n   securing these signalling messages.\n   ULE Stream security only concerns\
    \ the security between the ULE\n   Encapsulation Gateway (ULE Encapsulator) and\
    \ the Receiver.  In many\n   deployment scenarios the user of a ULE Stream has\
    \ to secure\n   communications beyond the link since other network links are utilised\n\
    \   in addition to the ULE link.  Therefore, if authentication of the\n   endpoints,\
    \ i.e., the IP Sources, is required, or users are concerned\n   about loss of\
    \ confidentiality, integrity, or authenticity of their\n   communication data,\
    \ they will have to employ end-to-end network\n   security mechanisms, e.g., IPsec\
    \ or Transport Layer Security (TLS).\n   Governmental users may be forced by regulations\
    \ to employ specific\n   approved implementations of those mechanisms.  Hence,\
    \ for such cases,\n   the requirements for confidentiality and integrity of the\
    \ user data\n   will be met by the end-to-end security mechanism and the ULE security\n\
    \   measures would focus on providing traffic flow confidentiality either\n  \
    \ for user data that has already been encrypted or for users who choose\n   not\
    \ to implement end-to-end security mechanisms.\n   ULE links may also be used\
    \ for communications where the two IP\n   endpoints are not under central control\
    \ (e.g., when browsing a public\n   web site).  In these cases, it may be impossible\
    \ to enforce any end-\n   to-end security mechanisms.  Yet, a common objective\
    \ is that users\n   may make the same security assumptions as for wired links\
    \ [RFC3819].\n   ULE security could achieve this by protecting the vulnerable\
    \ (in\n   terms of passive attacks) ULE Stream.\n   In contrast to the above,\
    \ a ULE Stream can be used to link networks\n   such as branch offices to a central\
    \ office.  ULE link-layer security\n   could be the sole provider of confidentiality\
    \ and integrity.  In this\n   scenario, users requiring high assurance of security\
    \ (e.g.,\n   government use) will need to employ approved cryptographic equipment\n\
    \   (e.g., at the network layer).  An implementation of ULE Link Security\n  \
    \ equipment could also be certified for use by specific user\n   communities.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Threats

  - "3.2.  Threats\n   The simplest type of network threat is a passive threat.  This\n\
    \   includes eavesdropping or monitoring of transmissions, with a goal to\n  \
    \ obtain information that is being transmitted.  In broadcast networks\n   (especially\
    \ those utilising widely available low-cost physical layer\n   interfaces, such\
    \ as DVB), the passive threats are the major threats.\n   One example is an intruder\
    \ monitoring the MPEG-2 transmission\n   broadcast and then extracting the data\
    \ carried within the link.\n   Another example is an intruder trying to determine\
    \ the identity of\n   the communicating parties and the volume of their traffic\
    \ by sniffing\n   (L2) addresses.  This is a well-known issue in the security\
    \ field;\n   however, it is more of a problem in the case of broadcast networks\n\
    \   such as MPEG-2 transmission networks because of the easy availability\n  \
    \ of Receiver hardware and the wide geographical span of the networks.\n   Active\
    \ threats (or attacks) are, in general, more difficult to\n   implement successfully\
    \ than passive threats, and usually require more\n   sophisticated resources and\
    \ may require access to the transmitter.\n   Within the context of MPEG-2 transmission\
    \ networks, examples of\n   active attacks are:\n   o Masquerading: An entity\
    \ pretends to be a different entity.  This\n     includes masquerading other users\
    \ and subnetwork control plane\n     messages.\n   o Modification of messages\
    \ in an unauthorised manner.\n   o Replay attacks: When an intruder sends some\
    \ old (authentic)\n     messages to the Receiver.  In the case of a broadcast\
    \ link, access\n     to previous broadcast data is easy.\n   o Denial-of-Service\
    \ (DoS) attacks: When an entity fails to perform\n     its proper function or\
    \ acts in a way that prevents other entities\n     from performing their proper\
    \ functions.\n   The active threats mentioned above are major security concerns\
    \ for\n   the Internet community [BELLOVIN].  Masquerading and modification of\n\
    \   IP packets are comparatively easy in an Internet environment, whereas\n  \
    \ such attacks are in fact much harder for MPEG-2 broadcast links.\n   This could,\

    \ not for synchronous links.  This is further\n   reflected in the security requirements\
    \ for Case 2 and 3 in Section 4\n   below.\n   As explained in Section 3.1, the\
    \ PID associated with an Elementary\n   Stream can be modified (e.g., in some\
    \ systems by reception of an\n   updated SI table, or in other systems until the\
    \ next\n   announcement/discovery data is received).  An attacker that is able\n\
    \   to modify the content of the received multiplex (e.g., replay data\n   and/or\
    \ control information) could inject data locally into the\n   received stream\
    \ with an arbitrary PID value.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Threat Cases
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Threat Cases\n   Analysing the topological scenarios for MPEG-2 Transmission\
    \ Networks\n   in Section 1, the security threats can be abstracted into three\n\
    \   cases:\n   o Case 1: Monitoring (passive threat).  Here the intruder monitors\n\
    \     the ULE broadcasts to gain information about the ULE data and/or\n     tracking\
    \ the communicating parties identities (by monitoring the\n     destination NPA\
    \ address).  In this scenario, measures must be taken\n     to protect the ULE\
    \ payload data and the identity of ULE Receivers.\n   o Case 2: Locally conducting\
    \ active attacks on the MPEG-TS multiplex.\n     Here an intruder is assumed to\
    \ be sufficiently sophisticated to\n     override the original transmission from\
    \ the ULE Encapsulation\n     Gateway and deliver a modified version of the MPEG-TS\
    \ transmission\n     to a single ULE Receiver or a small group of Receivers (e.g.,\
    \ in a\n     single company site).  The MPEG-2 transmission network operator\n\
    \     might not be aware of such attacks.  Measures must be taken to\n     ensure\
    \ ULE data integrity and authenticity and preventing replay of\n     old messages.\n\
    \   o Case 3: Globally conducting active attacks on the MPEG-TS\n     multiplex.\
    \  This assumes a sophisticated intruder able to override\n     the whole MPEG-2\
    \ transmission multiplex.  The requirements are\n     similar to case 2.  The\
    \ MPEG-2 transmission network operator can\n     usually identify such attacks\
    \ and provide corrective action to\n     restore the original transmission.\n\
    \   For both Cases 2 and 3, there can be two sub-cases:\n   o Insider attacks,\
    \ i.e., active attacks from adversaries within the\n     network with knowledge\
    \ of the secret material.\n   o Outsider attacks, i.e., active attacks from adversaries\
    \ without\n     knowledge of the secret material.\n   In terms of priority, Case\
    \ 1 is considered the major threat in MPEG-2\n   transmission systems.  Case 2\
    \ is considered a lesser threat,\n   appropriate to specific network configurations,\
    \ especially when\n   vulnerable to insider attacks.  Case 3 is less likely to\
    \ be found in\n   an operational network, and is expected to be noticed by the\
    \ MPEG-2\n   transmission operator.  It will require restoration of the original\n\
    \   transmission.  The assumption being that physical access to the\n   network\
    \ components (multiplexers, etc.) and/or connecting physical\n   media is secure.\
    \  Therefore, Case 3 is not considered further in this\n   document.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Requirements for IP over MPEG-2 TS
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Requirements for IP over MPEG-2 TS\n   From the threat analysis\
    \ in Section 3, the following security\n   requirements can be derived:\n   Req\
    \ 1. Data confidentiality MUST be provided by a link that supports\n      ULE\
    \ Stream Security to prevent passive attacks and reduce the risk\n      of active\
    \ threats.\n   Req 2. Protection of L2 NPA address is OPTIONAL.  In broadcast\n\
    \      networks, this protection can be used to prevent an intruder\n      tracking\
    \ the identity of ULE Receivers and the volume of their\n      traffic.\n   Req\
    \ 3. Integrity protection and source authentication of ULE Stream\n      data\
    \ are OPTIONAL.  These can be used to prevent the active\n      attacks described\
    \ in Section 3.2.\n   Req 4. Protection against replay attacks is OPTIONAL.  This\
    \ is used\n      to counter the active attacks described in Section 3.2.\n   Req\
    \ 5. L2 ULE Source and Receiver authentication is OPTIONAL.  This\n      can be\
    \ performed during the initial key exchange and\n      authentication phase, before\
    \ the ULE Receiver can join a secure\n      session with the ULE Encapsulator\
    \ (ULE source).  This could be\n      either unidirectional or bidirectional authentication\
    \ based on the\n      underlying key management protocol.\n   Other general requirements\
    \ for all threat cases for link-layer\n   security are:\n   GReq (a) ULE key management\
    \ functions MUST be decoupled from ULE\n      security services such as encryption\
    \ and source authentication.\n      This allows the independent development of\
    \ both systems.\n   GReq (b) Support SHOULD be provided for automated as well\
    \ as manual\n      insertion of keys and policy into the relevant databases.\n\
    \   GReq (c) Algorithm agility MUST be supported.  It should be possible\n   \
    \   to update the crypto algorithms and hashes when they become\n      obsolete\
    \ without affecting the overall security of the system.\n   GReq (d) The security\
    \ extension header MUST be compatible with other\n      ULE extension headers.\
    \  The method must allow other extension\n      headers (either mandatory or optional)\
    \ to be used in combination\n      with a security extension.  It is RECOMMENDED\
    \ that these are\n      placed after the security extension header.  This permits\
    \ full\n      protection for all headers.  It also avoids situations where the\n\
    \      SNDU has to be discarded on processing the security extension\n      header,\
    \ while preceding headers have already been evaluated.  One\n      exception is\
    \ the Timestamp extension that SHOULD precede the\n      security extension header\
    \ [RFC5163].  In this case, the timestamp\n      will be unaffected by security\
    \ services such as data\n      confidentiality and can be decoded without the\
    \ need for key\n      material.\n   Examining the threat cases in Section 3.3,\
    \ the security requirements\n   for each case can be summarised as:\n   o Case\
    \ 1: Data confidentiality (Req 1) MUST be provided to prevent\n     monitoring\
    \ of the ULE data (such as user information and IP\n     addresses).  Protection\
    \ of NPA addresses (Req 2) MAY be provided to\n     prevent tracking ULE Receivers\
    \ and their communications.\n   o Case 2: In addition to Case 1 requirements,\
    \ new measures MAY be\n     implemented such as authentication schemes using Message\n\
    \     Authentication Codes, digital signatures, or Timed Efficient Stream\n  \
    \   Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA) [RFC4082] in order to provide\n     integrity\
    \ protection and source authentication (Reqs 3 and 5).  In\n     addition, sequence\
    \ numbers (Req 4) MAY be used to protect against\n     replay attacks.  In terms\
    \ of outsider attacks, group authentication\n     using Message Authentication\
    \ Codes can provide the required level\n     of security (Reqs 3 and 5).  This\
    \ will significantly reduce the\n     ability of intruders to successfully inject\
    \ their own data into the\n     MPEG-TS stream.  However, scenario 2 threats apply\
    \ only in specific\n     service cases, and therefore authentication and protection\
    \ against\n     replay attacks are OPTIONAL.  Such measures incur additional\n\
    \     transmission as well as processing overheads.  Moreover, intrusion\n   \
    \  detection systems may also be needed by the MPEG-2 network\n     operator.\
    \  These should best be coupled with perimeter security\n     policy to monitor\
    \ common DoS attacks.\n   o Case 3: As stated in Section 3.3, the requirements\
    \ here are similar\n     to Case 2, but since the MPEG-2 transmission network\
    \ operator can\n     usually identify such attacks, the constraints on intrusion\n\
    \     detections are less than in Case 2.\n   Table 1 below shows the threats\
    \ that are applicable to ULE networks,\n   and the relevant security mechanisms\
    \ to mitigate those threats.\n                                   Security Mechanism\n\

    \   It defines the requirements for ULE security and states the\n   motivation\
    \ for link security as a part of the Encapsulation layer.\n   ULE security must\
    \ provide link-layer encryption and ULE Receiver\n   identity protection.  The\
    \ framework must support the optional ability\n   to provide for link-layer authentication\
    \ and integrity assurance, as\n   well as protection against insertion of old\
    \ (duplicated) data into\n   the ULE Stream (i.e., replay protection).  This set\
    \ of features is\n   optional to reduce encapsulation overhead when not required.\n\
    \   ULE Stream security between a ULE Encapsulation Gateway and the\n   corresponding\
    \ Receiver(s) is considered an additional security\n   mechanism to IPsec, TLS,\
    \ and application layer end-to-end security,\n   and not as a replacement.  It\
    \ allows a network operator to provide\n   similar functions to that of IPsec,\

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   Link-layer (L2) encryption of IP traffic is commonly\
    \ used in\n   broadcast/radio links to supplement end-to-end security (e.g.,\n\
    \   provided by TLS [RFC5246], SSH [RFC4251], IPsec [RFC4301]).\n   A common objective\
    \ is to provide the same level of privacy as wired\n   links.  It is recommended\
    \ that an ISP or user provide end-to-end\n   security services based on well-known\
    \ mechanisms such as IPsec or\n   TLS.\n   This document provides a threat analysis\

    \ security issues that were raised in RFC 4326 [RFC4326]\n   that are not addressed\
    \ in this document (i.e., are out of scope),\n   e.g.:\n   o The security issue\

    \ frames exposes the\n     traffic to potentially undetected corruption while\
    \ being processed\n     by the Encapsulator and/or Receiver.\n   o There is a\
    \ potential security issue when a Receiver receives a PDU\n     with two Length\
    \ fields.  The Receiver would need to validate the\n     actual length and the\
    \ Length field and ensure that inconsistent\n     values are not propagated by\

    \ framework is\n   responsible for user authentication, access control, and Security\n\
    \   Association negotiation (which include the negotiations of the\n   security\
    \ algorithms to be used and the generation of the different\n   session keys as\
    \ well as policy material).  The key management\n   framework can be either automated\
    \ or manual.  Hence, this key\n   management client entity (shown as the Key Management\
    \ Group Member\n   Block in Figure 2) will be present in all ULE Receivers as\
    \ well as at\n   the ULE Encapsulators.  The ULE Encapsulator could also be the\

  contents:
  - "B.1.  Security at the IP Layer (Using IPsec)\n   The security architecture for\
    \ the Internet Protocol [RFC4301]\n   describes security services for traffic\
    \ at the IP layer.  This\n   architecture primarily defines services for the Internet\
    \ Protocol\n   (IP) unicast packets, as well as manually configured IP multicast\n\
    \   packets.\n   It is possible to use IPsec to secure ULE Streams.  The major\n\
    \   advantage of IPsec is its wide implementation in IP routers and\n   hosts.\
    \  IPsec in transport mode can be used for end-to-end security\n   transparently\
    \ over MPEG-2 transmission links with little impact.\n   In the context of MPEG-2\
    \ transmission links, if IPsec is used to\n   secure a ULE Stream, then the ULE\
    \ Encapsulator and Receivers are\n   equivalent to the security gateways in IPsec\
    \ terminology.  A security\n   gateway implementation of IPsec uses tunnel mode.\
    \  Such usage has the\n   following disadvantages:\n   o There is an extra transmission\
    \ overhead associated with using IPsec\n     in tunnel mode, i.e., the extra IP\
    \ header (IPv4 or IPv6).\n   o There is a need to protect the identity (NPA address)\
    \ of ULE\n     Receivers over the ULE broadcast medium; IPsec is not suitable\
    \ for\n     providing this service.  In addition, the interfaces of these\n  \
    \   devices do not necessarily have IP addresses (they can be L2\n     devices).\n\
    \   o Multicast is considered a major service over ULE links.  The\n     current\
    \ IPsec specifications [RFC4301] only define a pairwise\n     tunnel between two\
    \ IPsec devices with manual keying.  Work is in\n     progress in defining the\
    \ extra detail needed for multicast and to\n     use the tunnel mode with address\
    \ preservation to allow efficient\n     multicasting.  For further details refer\
    \ to [RFC5374].\n"
- title: B.2.  Link Security below the Encapsulation Layer
  contents:
  - "B.2.  Link Security below the Encapsulation Layer\n   Link layer security can\
    \ be provided at the MPEG-2 TS layer (below\n   ULE).  MPEG-2 TS encryption encrypts\
    \ all TS Packets sent with a\n   specific PID value.  However, an MPEG-2 TS may\
    \ typically multiplex\n   several IP flows, belonging to different users, using\
    \ a common PID.\n   Therefore, all multiplexed traffic will share the same security\
    \ keys.\n   This has the following advantages:\n   o The bit stream sent on the\
    \ broadcast network does not expose any L2\n     or L3 headers, specifically all\
    \ addresses, type fields, and length\n     fields are encrypted prior to transmission.\n\
    \   o This method does not preclude the use of IPsec, TLS, or any other\n    \
    \ form of higher-layer security.\n   However it has the following disadvantages:\n\
    \   o When a PID is shared between several users, each ULE Receiver needs\n  \
    \   to decrypt all MPEG-2 TS Packets with a matching PID, possibly\n     including\
    \ those that are not required to be forwarded.  Therefore,\n     it does not have\
    \ the flexibility to separately secure individual IP\n     flows.\n   o When a\
    \ PID is shared between several users, the ULE Receivers will\n     have access\
    \ to private traffic destined to other ULE Receivers,\n     since they share a\
    \ common PID and key.\n   o IETF-based key management that is very flexible and\
    \ secure is not\n     used in existing MPEG-2 based systems.  Existing access\
    \ control\n     mechanisms in such systems have limited flexibility in terms of\n\
    \     controlling the use of keying and rekeying.  Therefore, if the key\n   \
    \  is compromised, this will impact several ULE Receivers.\n   Currently, there\
    \ are few deployed L2 security systems for MPEG-2\n   transmission networks. \
    \ Conditional access for digital TV\n   broadcasting is one example.  However,\
    \ this approach is optimised for\n   TV services and is not well-suited to IP\
    \ packet transmission.  Some\n   other systems are specified in standards such\
    \ as MPE [ETSI-DAT], but\n   there are currently no known implementations and\
    \ these methods are\n   not applicable to GSE.\n"

  contents:
  - "B.3.  Link Security as a Part of the Encapsulation Layer\n   Examining the threat\
    \ analysis in Section 3 has shown that protection\n   of ULE Stream from eavesdropping\
    \ and ULE Receiver identity are major\n   requirements.\n   There are several\
    \ advantages in using ULE link-layer security:\n   o The protection of the complete\
    \ ULE Protocol Data Unit (PDU)\n     including IP addresses.  The protection can\
    \ be applied either per\n     IP flow or per Receiver NPA address.\n   o Ability\
    \ to protect the identity of the Receiver within the MPEG-2\n     transmission\
    \ network at the IP layer and also at L2.\n   o Efficient protection of IP multicast\
    \ over ULE links.\n   o Transparency to the use of Network Address Translation\
    \ (NATs)\n     [RFC3715] and TCP Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEP) [RFC3135],\n\
    \     which require the ability to inspect and modify the packets sent\n     over\
    \ the ULE link.\n   This method does not preclude the use of IPsec at L3 (or TLS\n\
    \   [RFC5246] at L4).  IPsec and TLS provide strong authentication of the\n  \
    \ endpoints in the communication.\n   L3 end-to-end security would partially deny\
    \ the advantage listed\n   above (use of PEP, compression, etc.), since those\
    \ techniques could\n   only be applied to TCP packets bearing a TCP-encapsulated\
    \ IPsec\n   packet exchange, but not the TCP packets of the original\n   applications,\
    \ which in particular inhibits compression.\n   End-to-end security (IPsec, TLS,\
    \ etc.) may be used independently to\n   provide strong authentication of the\
    \ endpoints in the communication.\n   This authentication is desirable in many\
    \ scenarios to ensure that the\n   correct information is being exchanged between\
    \ the trusted parties,\n   whereas Layer 2 methods cannot provide this guarantee.\n"
