  - "2. ITU-T Definition\n   Recommendation G.726 [G726] defines the characteristics\
    \ that are\n   recommended for the conversion of a 64 kbit/s A-law or m-law pulse\n\
    \   code modulation (PCM) channel at 8000 samples/second to and from a\n   40,\
    \ 32, 24 or 16 kbit/s channel. The conversion is applied to the PCM\n   bit stream\
    \ using an adaptive differential pulse code modulation\n   (ADPCM) transcoding\
    \ technique.  This Recommendation obsoletes G.721\n   which only defined the 32\
    \ kbit/s characteristics.\n   Recommendation G.726 was prepared by Study Group\
    \ 15 of the\n   Telecommunications Standardization Sector of the International\n\
    \   Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) and was approved under the ITU's\n   Resolution\

  - "3.1 audio/32KADPCM\n   CCITT Recommendation G.726 [G726] describes the algorithm\
    \ recommended\n   for conversion of a 64 kbit/s A-law or u-law PCM channel to\
    \ and from\n   a 32 kbit/s channel (this is the same algorithm as described in\
    \ the\n   deprecated G.721).  The conversion is applied to the PCM stream using\n\
    \   an Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM) transcoding\n   technique.\n\
    \   The MIME sub-type audio/32KADPCM is defined to hold binary audio data\n  \
    \ encoded in 32 kbit/s ADPCM exactly as defined by ITU-T Recommendation\n   G.726.\
    \  No header information shall be included as part of the audio\n   data.  The\
    \ content transfer encoding is typically either binary or\n   base64.\n   An additional\
    \ consideration that this document defines for clarity is\n   the choice of little\
    \ endian ordering of the four bit code words.\n   This default ordering is defined\
    \ in ITU-T Recommendation X.420 [X420]\n   for the equivalent X.400 body part,\
    \ but is also detailed below in the\n   IANA Registration.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2 VPIM Usage\n   The audio/32KADPCM sub-type is a primary component of the\
    \ VPIM\n   specification [VPIM].  In this context, the Content-Description and\n\
    \   Content-Disposition headers are used to succinctly describe the\n   contents\
    \ of the audio body.  As well, only the little endian bit\n   ordering is valid.\

    \ significant bit (LSB) of the code word\n      (A0) in the least significant\
