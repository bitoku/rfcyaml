  - "1.  Introduction\n   Mobile data traffic continues to grow rapidly.  The challenge\n\
    \   wireless operators face is to support more subscribers with an\n   increasing\
    \ bandwidth demand.  To meet these bandwidth requirements,\n   there is a need\
    \ for new technologies that assist the operators in\n   efficiently utilizing\
    \ the available network resources.  Two specific\n   areas where such new technologies\
    \ could be deemed useful are resource\n   allocation and flow management.\n  \
    \ Analysis of data traffic in cellular networks has shown that most\n   flows\
    \ are short lived and low volume, but a comparatively small\n   number of high-volume\
    \ flows constitute a large fraction of the\n   overall traffic volume [lte-sigcomm2013].\
    \  That means that\n   potentially a small fraction of users is responsible for\
    \ the majority\n   of traffic in cellular networks.  In view of such highly skewed\
    \ user\n   behavior and limited and expensive resources (e.g., the wireless\n\
    \   spectrum), resource allocation and usage accountability are two\n   important\
    \ issues for operators to solve in order to achieve both a\n   better network\
    \ resource utilization and fair resource sharing.\n   ConEx, as described in [RFC6789],\
    \ is a technology that can be used to\n   achieve these goals.\n   The ConEx mechanism\
    \ is designed to be a general technology that could\n   be applied as a key element\
    \ of congestion management solutions for a\n   variety of use cases.  In particular,\
    \ use cases that are of interest\n   for initial deployment are those in which\
    \ the end hosts and the\n   network that contains the destination end hosts are\
    \ ConEx-enabled but\n   other networks need not be.\n   A specific example of\
    \ such a use case can be a mobile communication\n   network such as a 3GPP EPS\
    \ networks where UEs (User Equipment) (i.e.,\n   mobile end hosts), servers and\
    \ caches, the access network, and\n   possibly an operator's core network can\
    \ be ConEx-enabled; that is,\n   hosts support the ConEx mechanisms, and the network\
    \ provides\n   policing/auditing functions at its edges.\n   This document provides\
    \ a brief overview of the architecture of such\n   networks (access and core networks)\
    \ and current QoS mechanisms.  It\n   further discusses how such networks can\
    \ benefit from congestion\n   exposure concepts and how they should be applied.\
    \  Using this use\n   case as a basis, a set of requirements for ConEx mechanisms\
    \ are\n   described.\n"

- title: 2.  ConEx Use Cases in Mobile Communication Networks
  contents:
  - "2.  ConEx Use Cases in Mobile Communication Networks\n   In general, quality\
    \ of service and good network resource utilization\n   are important requirements\
    \ for mobile communication network\n   operators.  Radio access and backhaul capacity\
    \ are considered scarce\n   resources, and bandwidth (and radio resource) demand\
    \ is difficult to\n   predict precisely due to user mobility, radio propagation\
    \ effects,\n   etc.  Hence, today's architectures and protocols go to significant\n\
    \   lengths in order to provide network-controlled quality of service.\n   These\
    \ efforts often lead to complexity and cost.  ConEx could be a\n   simpler and\
    \ more capable approach to efficient resource sharing in\n   these networks.\n\
    \   In the following sections, we discuss ways that congestion exposure\n   could\
    \ be beneficial for supporting resource management in such mobile\n   communication\
    \ networks.  [RFC6789] describes fundamental congestion\n   exposure concepts\
    \ and a set of use cases for applying congestion\n   exposure mechanisms to realize\
    \ different traffic management functions\n   such as flow policy-based traffic\
    \ management or traffic offloading.\n   Readers that are not familiar with the\
    \ 3GPP EPS should refer to\n   Appendix A first.\n"
- title: 2.1.  ConEx as a Basis for Traffic Management
  contents:
  - "2.1.  ConEx as a Basis for Traffic Management\n   Traffic management is a very\
    \ important function in mobile\n   communication networks.  Since wireless resources\
    \ are considered\n   scarce and since user mobility and shared bandwidth in the\
    \ wireless\n   access create certain dynamics with respect to available bandwidth,\n\
    \   commercially operated mobile networks provide mechanisms for tight\n   resource\
    \ management (admission control for bearer establishment).\n   However, sometimes\
    \ these mechanisms are not easily applicable to IP-\n   and HTTP-dominated traffic\
    \ mixes; for example, most Internet traffic\n   in today's mobile network is transmitted\
    \ over the (best-effort)\n   default bearer.\n   Given the above, and in the light\
    \ of the significant increase of\n   overall data volume in 3G networks, Deep\
    \ Packet Inspection (DPI) is\n   often considered a desirable function to have\
    \ in the Evolved Packet\n   Core (EPC) -- despite its cost and complexity.  However,\
    \ with the\n   increase of encrypted data traffic, traffic management using DPI\n\
    \   alone will become even more challenging.\n   Congestion exposure can be employed\
    \ to address resource management\n   requirements in different ways:\n   1.  It\
    \ can enable or enhance flow policy-based traffic management.\n       At present,\
    \ DPI-based resource management is often used to\n       prioritize certain application\
    \ classes with respect to others in\n       overload situations, so that more\
    \ users can be served effectively\n       on the network.  In overload situations,\
    \ operators use DPI to\n       identify dispensable flows and make them yield\
    \ to other flows (of\n       different application classes) through policing.\
    \  Such traffic\n       management is thus based on operator decisions, using\
    \ partly\n       static configuration and some estimation about the future per-\n\
    \       flow bandwidth demand.  With congestion exposure, it would be\n      \
    \ possible to assess the contribution to congestion of individual\n       flows.\
    \  This information can then be used as input to a policer\n       that can optimize\
    \ network utilization more accurately and\n       dynamically.  By using ConEx\
    \ congestion contribution as a metric,\n       such policers would not need to\
    \ be aware of specific link loads\n       (e.g., in wireless base stations) or\
    \ flow application types.\n   2.  It can reduce the need for complex DPI by allowing\
    \ for a bulk\n       packet traffic management system that does not have to consider\n\
    \       either the application classes flows belong to or the individual\n   \
    \    sessions.  Instead, traffic management would be based on the\n       current\
    \ cost (contribution to congestion) incurred by different\n       flows and enable\
    \ operators to apply policing/accounting depending\n       on their preference.\
    \  Such traffic management would be simpler\n       and more robust (no real-time\
    \ flow application type\n       identification required, no static configuration\
    \ of application\n       classes); it would also perform better as decisions can\
    \ be made\n       based on real-time actual cost contribution.  With ConEx,\n\
    \       accurate downstream path information would be visible to ingress\n   \
    \    network operators, which can respond to incipient congestion in\n       time.\
    \  This can be equivalent to offering different levels of\n       QoS, e.g., premium\
    \ service with zero congestion response.  For\n       that, ConEx could be used\
    \ in two different ways:\n       A.  as additional information to assist network\
    \ functions to\n           impose different QoS for different application sessions;\
    \ and\n       B.  as a tool to let applications decide on their response to\n\
    \           congestion notification while incentivizing them to react (in\n  \
    \         general) appropriately, e.g., by enforcing overall limits for\n    \
    \       congestion contribution or by accounting and charging for\n          \
    \ such congestion contribution.  Note that this level of\n           responsiveness\
    \ would be on a different level than, say,\n           application-layer responsiveness\
    \ in protocols such as Dynamic\n           Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH)\
    \ [dash]; however, it could\n           interwork with such protocols, for example,\
    \ by triggering\n           earlier responses.\n   3.  It can further be used\
    \ to more effectively trigger the offload of\n       selected traffic to a non-3GPP\
    \ network.  Nowadays, it is common\n       that users are equipped with dual-mode\
    \ mobile phones (e.g.,\n       integrating third/fourth generation cellular and\
    \ Wi-Fi radio\n       devices) capable of attaching to available networks either\n\
    \       sequentially or simultaneously.  With this scenario in mind, 3GPP\n  \
    \     is currently looking at mechanisms to seamlessly and selectively\n     \
    \  switch over a single IP flow (e.g., user application) to a\n       different\
    \ radio access while keeping all other ongoing\n       connections untouched.\
    \  The decision on when and which IP flows\n       move is typically based on\
    \ statically configured rules, whereas\n       the use of ConEx mechanisms could\
    \ also factor real-time\n       congestion information into the decision.\n  \
    \ In summary, it can be said that traffic management in the 3GPP EPS\n   and other\
    \ mobile communication architectures is very important.\n   Currently, more static\
    \ approaches based on admission control and\n   static QoS are in use, but recently,\
    \ there has been a perceived need\n   for more dynamic mechanisms based on DPI.\
    \  Introducing ConEx could\n   make these mechanisms more efficient or even remove\
    \ the need for some\n   of the DPI functions deployed today.\n"
- title: 2.2.  ConEx to Incentivize Scavenger Transports
  contents:
  - "2.2.  ConEx to Incentivize Scavenger Transports\n   3G and LTE networks are turning\
    \ into universal access networks that\n   are shared between mobile (smart) phone\
    \ users, mobile users with\n   laptop PCs, home users with LTE access, and others.\
    \  Capacity sharing\n   among different users and application flows becomes increasingly\n\
    \   important in these mobile communication networks.\n   Most of this traffic\
    \ is likely to be classified as best-effort\n   traffic without differentiating,\
    \ for example, periodic OS updates and\n   application store downloads from web-based\
    \ (i.e., browser-based)\n   communication or other real-time communication.  For\
    \ many of the bulk\n   data transfers, completion times are not important within\
    \ certain\n   bounds; therefore, if scavenger transports (or transports that are\n\
    \   less than best effort) such as Low Extra Delay Background Transport\n   (LEDBAT)\
    \ [RFC6817] were used, it would improve the overall utility of\n   the network.\
    \  The use of these transports by the end user, however,\n   needs to be incentivized.\
    \  ConEx could be used to build an incentive\n   scheme, e.g., by giving a larger\
    \ bandwidth allowance to users that\n   contribute less to congestion or lowering\
    \ the next monthly\n   subscription fee.  In principle, this would be possible\
    \ to implement\n   with current specifications.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Accounting for Congestion Volume
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Accounting for Congestion Volume\n   3G and LTE networks provide extensive\
    \ support for accounting and\n   charging already, for example, see the Policy\
    \ Charging Control (PCC)\n   architecture [TS23203].  In fact, most operators\
    \ today account\n   transmitted data volume on a very fine granular basis and\
    \ either\n   correlate monthly charging to the exact number of packets/bytes\n\
    \   transmitted or employ some form of flat rate (or flexible flat rate),\n  \
    \ often with a so-called fair-use policy.  With such policies, users\n   are typically\
    \ limited to an administratively configured maximum\n   bandwidth limit after\
    \ they have used up their contractual data volume\n   budget for the charging\
    \ period.\n   Changing this data from volume-based accounting to congestion-based\n\
    \   accounting would be possible in principle, especially since there\n   already\
    \ is an elaborate per-user accounting system available.  Also,\n   an operator-provided\
    \ mobile communication network can be seen as a\n   network domain that would\
    \ allow for such congestion volume\n   accounting.  This would not require any\
    \ support from the global\n   Internet, especially since the typical scarce resources\
    \ such as the\n   wireless access and the mobile backhaul are all within this\
    \ domain.\n   Traffic normally leaves/enters the operator's network via well-\n\
    \   defined egress/ingress points that would be ideal candidates for\n   policing\
    \ functions.  Moreover, in most commercially operated\n   networks, accounting\
    \ is performed for both received and sent data,\n   which would facilitate congestion\
    \ volume accounting as well.\n   With respect to the current Path Computation\
    \ Client (PCC) framework,\n   accounting for congestion volume could be added\
    \ as another feature to\n   the \"Usage Monitoring Control\" capability that is\
    \ currently based on\n   data volume.  This would not require a new interface\
    \ (reference\n   points) at all.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Partial vs. Full Deployment
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Partial vs. Full Deployment\n   In general, ConEx lends itself to partial\
    \ deployment as the mechanism\n   does not require all routers and hosts to support\
    \ congestion\n   exposure.  Moreover, assuming a policing infrastructure has been\
    \ put\n   in place, it is not required to modify all hosts.  Since ConEx is\n\
    \   about senders exposing congestion contribution to the network,\n   senders\
    \ need to be made ConEx-aware (assuming a congestion\n   notification mechanism\
    \ such as Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)\n   is in place).\n   When moving\
    \ towards full deployment in a specific operator's network,\n   different ways\
    \ for introducing ConEx support on UEs are feasible.\n   Since mobile communication\
    \ networks are multi-vendor networks,\n   standardizing ConEx support on UEs (e.g.,\
    \ in 3GPP specifications)\n   appears useful.  Still, not all UEs would have to\
    \ support ConEx, and\n   operators would be free to choose their policing approach\
    \ in such\n   deployment scenarios.  Leveraging existing PCC architectures, 3GPP\n\
    \   network operators could, for example, decide policing/accounting\n   approaches\
    \ per UE -- i.e., apply fixed volume caps for non-ConEx UEs\n   and more flexible\
    \ schemes for ConEx-enabled UEs.\n   Moreover, it should be noted that network\
    \ support for ConEx is a\n   feature that some operators may choose to deploy\
    \ if they wish, but it\n   is not required that all operators (or all other networks)\
    \ do so.\n   Depending on the extent of ConEx support, specific aspects such as\n\
    \   roaming have to be taken into account, i.e., what happens when a user\n  \
    \ is roaming in a ConEx-enabled network but their UE is not ConEx-\n   enabled\
    \ and vice versa.  Although these may not be fundamental\n   problems, they need\
    \ to be considered.  For supporting mobility in\n   general, it can be required\
    \ to shift users' policing state during a\n   handover.  There is existing work\
    \ on distributed rate limiting (see\n   [raghavan2007]) and on specific optimizations\
    \ (see [nec.euronf-2011])\n   for congestion exposure and policing in mobility\
    \ scenarios.\n   Another aspect to consider is the addition of Selected IP Traffic\n\
    \   Offload (SIPTO) and Local IP Access (LIPA) [TR23829]), i.e., the idea\n  \
    \ that some traffic such as high-volume Internet traffic is actually\n   not passed\
    \ through the EPC but is offloaded at a \"break-out point\"\n   closer to (or\
    \ in) the access network.  On the other hand, ConEx can\n   also enable more dynamic\
    \ decisions on what traffic to actually\n   offload by considering congestion\
    \ exposure in bulk traffic\n   aggregates, thus making traffic offload more effective.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Summary
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Summary\n   In summary, the 3GPP EPS is a system architecture that can\
    \ benefit\n   from congestion exposure in multiple ways.  Dynamic traffic and\n\
    \   congestion management is an acknowledged and important requirement\n   for\
    \ the EPS; this is also illustrated by the current DPI-related work\n   for EPS.\n\
    \   Moreover, networks such as an EPS mobile communication network would\n   be\
    \ quite amenable for deploying ConEx as a mechanism, since they\n   represent\
    \ clearly defined and well-separated operational domains in\n   which local ConEx\
    \ deployment would be possible.  Aside from roaming\n   (which needs to be considered\
    \ for a specific solution), such a\n   deployment is fully under the control of\
    \ a single operator, which can\n   enable operator-local enhancement without the\
    \ need for major changes\n   to the architecture.\n   In 3GPP EPS, interfaces\
    \ between all elements of the architecture are\n   subject to standardization,\
    \ including UE interfaces and eNB\n   interfaces, so that a more general approach,\
    \ involving more than a\n   single operator's network, can be feasible as well.\n"

  - "3.  ConEx in the EPS\n   In this section, we discuss a few options for how such\
    \ a mechanism\n   (and possibly additional policing functions) could eventually\
    \ be\n   deployed in the 3GPP EPS.  Note that this description of options is\n\
    \   not intended to be a complete set of possible approaches; it merely\n   discusses\
    \ the most promising options.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Possible Deployment Scenarios
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Possible Deployment Scenarios\n   There are different possible ways for\
    \ how ConEx functions on hosts\n   and network elements can be used.  For example,\
    \ ConEx could be used\n   for a limited part of the network only (e.g., for the\
    \ access\n   network), congestion exposure and sender adaptation could involve\
    \ the\n   mobile nodes or not, or, finally, the ConEx feedback loop could\n  \
    \ extend beyond a single operator's domain or not.\n   We present four different\
    \ deployment scenarios for congestion\n   exposure in the figures below:\n   1.\
    \  In Figure 1, ConEx is supported by servers for sending data (web\n       servers\
    \ in the Internet and caches in an operator's network) but\n       not by UEs\
    \ (neither for receiving nor sending).  An operator who\n       chooses to run\
    \ a policing function on the network ingress, e.g.,\n       on the P-GW, can still\
    \ benefit from congestion exposure without\n       requiring any change on UEs.\n\
    \   2.  ConEx is universally employed between operators (as depicted in\n    \
    \   Figure 2) with an end-to-end ConEx feedback loop.  Here,\n       operators\
    \ could still employ local policies, congestion\n       accounting schemes, etc.,\
    \ and they could use information about\n       congestion contribution for determining\
    \ interconnection\n       agreements.  This deployment scenario would imply the\
    \ willingness\n       of operators to expose congestion to each other.\n   3.\
    \  For Isolated ConEx domains as depicted in Figure 3, ConEx is\n       solely\
    \ applied locally in the operator network, and there is no\n       end-to-end\
    \ congestion exposure.  This could be the case when\n       ConEx is only implemented\
    \ in a few networks or when operators\n       decide to not expose ECN and account\
    \ for congestion for inter-\n       domain traffic.  Independent of the actual\
    \ scenario, it is likely\n       that there will be border gateways (as in today's\
    \ deployments)\n       that are associated with policing and accounting functions.\n\
    \   4.  [conex-lite] describes an approach called \"ConEx Lite\" for mobile\n\
    \       networks that is intended for initial deployment of congestion\n     \
    \  exposure concepts in LTE, specifically in the backhaul and core\n       network\
    \ segments.  As depicted in Figure 4, ConEx Lite allows a\n       tunnel receiver\
    \ to monitor the volume of bytes that has been\n       lost, dropped, or ECN-CE\
    \ (Congestion Experienced) marked between\n       the tunnel sender and receiver.\
    \  For that purpose, a new field\n       called the Byte Sequence Marker (BSN)\
    \ is introduced to the tunnel\n       header to identify the byte in the flow\
    \ of data from the tunnel\n       sender to the tunnel receiver.  A policer at\
    \ the tunnel sender is\n       expected to react according to the tunnel congestion\
    \ volume (see\n       [conex-lite] for details).\n                           \

  contents:
  - "3.2.  Implementing ConEx Functions in the EPS\n   We expect a ConEx solution\
    \ to consist of different functions that\n   should be considered when implementing\
    \ congestion exposure in the\n   3GPP EPS.  [RFC7713] describes the following\
    \ congestion exposure\n   components:\n   o  Modified senders that send congestion\
    \ exposure information in\n      response to congestion feedback.\n   o  Receivers\
    \ that generate congestion feedback (leveraging existing\n      behavior or requiring\
    \ new functions).\n   o  Audit functions that audit ConEx signals against actual\n\
    \      congestion, e.g., by monitoring flows or aggregate of flows.\n   o  Policy\
    \ devices that monitor congestion exposure information and\n      act on the flows\
    \ according to the operator's policy.\n   Two aspects are important to consider:\
    \ 1) how the ConEx protocol\n   mechanisms would be implemented and what modifications\
    \ to existing\n   networks would be required, and 2) where ConEx functional entities\n\
    \   would be placed best (to allow for a non-invasive addition).  We\n   discuss\
    \ these two aspects in the following sections.\n"
- title: 3.2.1.  ConEx Protocol Mechanisms
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  ConEx Protocol Mechanisms\n   The most important step in introducing\
    \ ConEx (initially) is adding\n   the congestion exposure functionality to senders.\
    \  For an initial\n   deployment, no further modification to senders and receivers\
    \ would be\n   required.  Specifically, there is no fundamental dependency on\
    \ ECN,\n   i.e., ConEx can be introduced without requiring ECN to be\n   implemented.\n\
    \   Congestion exposure information for IPv6 [CONEX-DESTOPT] is contained\n  \
    \ in a destination option header field, which requires minimal changes\n   at\
    \ senders and nodes that want to assess path congestion.  The\n   destination\
    \ option header field does not affect non-ConEx nodes in a\n   network.\n   In\
    \ 3GPP networks, IP tunneling is used intensively, i.e., using\n   either IP-in-GTP-U\
    \ or Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) (i.e., IP-in-IP)\n   tunnels.  In general, the\
    \ ConEx destination option of encapsulated\n   packets should be made available\
    \ for network nodes on the tunnel\n   path, i.e., a tunnel ingress should copy\
    \ the ConEx destination option\n   field to the outer header.\n   For effective\
    \ and efficient capacity sharing, we envisage the\n   deployment of ECN in conjunction\
    \ with ConEx so that ECN-enabled\n   receivers and senders get more accurate and\
    \ more timely information\n   about the congestion contribution of their flows.\
    \  ECN is already\n   partially introduced into 3GPP networks: Section 11.6 in\
    \ [TS36300]\n   specifies the usage of ECN for congestion notification on the\
    \ radio\n   link (between eNB and UE), and [TS26114] specifies how this can be\n\
    \   leveraged for voice codec adaptation.  A complete, end-to-end support\n  \
    \ of ECN would require specification of tunneling behaviour, which\n   should\
    \ be based on [RFC6040] (for IP-in-IP tunnels).  Specifically, a\n   specification\
    \ for tunneling ECN in GTP-U will be needed.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  ConEx Functions in the Mobile Network
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  ConEx Functions in the Mobile Network\n   In this section, we discuss\
    \ some possible placement strategies for\n   ConEx functional entities (addressing\
    \ both policing and auditing\n   functions) in the EPS and for possible optimizations\
    \ for both the\n   uplink and the downlink.\n   In general, ConEx information\
    \ (exposed congestion) is declared by a\n   sender and remains unchanged on the\
    \ path; hence, reading ConEx\n   information (e.g., by policing functions) is\
    \ placement-agnostic.\n   Auditing ConEx normally requires assessing declared\
    \ congestion\n   contribution and current actual congestion.  If the latter is,\
    \ for\n   example, done using ECN, such a function would best be placed at the\n\
    \   end of the path.\n   In order to provide a comprehensive ConEx-based capacity\
    \ management\n   framework for the EPS, it would be advantageous to consider user\n\
    \   contribution to congestion for both the radio access and the core\n   network.\
    \  For a non-invasive introduction of ConEx, it can be\n   beneficial to combine\
    \ ConEx functions with existing logical EPS\n   entities.  For example, potential\
    \ places for ConEx policing and\n   auditing functions would then be eNBs, S-GWs,\
    \ or the P-GWs.  Operator\n   deployments may, of course, still provide additional\
    \ intermediary\n   ConEx-enabled IP network elements.\n   For a more specific\
    \ discussion, it will be beneficial to distinguish\n   downlink and uplink traffic\
    \ directions (also see [nec.globecom2010]\n   for a more detailed discussion).\
    \  In today's networks and usage\n   models, downlink traffic is dominating (also\
    \ reflected by the\n   asymmetric capacity provided by the LTE radio interface).\
    \  That does\n   not, however, imply that uplink congestion is not an issue, since\
    \ the\n   asymmetric maximum bandwidth configuration can create a smaller\n  \
    \ bottleneck for uplink traffic.  There are, of course, backhaul links,\n   gateways,\
    \ etc., that could be overloaded as well.\n   For managing downlink traffic (e.g.,\
    \ in scenarios such as the one\n   depicted in Figure 1), operators can have different\
    \ requirements for\n   policing traffic.  Although policing is, in principle,\
    \ location-\n   agnostic, it is important to consider requirements related to\
    \ the EPS\n   architecture (Figure 5) such as tunneling between P-GWs and eNBs.\n\
    \   Policing can require access to subscriber information (e.g.,\n   congestion\
    \ contribution quota) or user-specific accounting, which\n   suggests that the\
    \ ConEx function could be co-located with the P-GW\n   that already has an interface\
    \ towards the Policy and Charging Rule\n   Function (PCRF).\n   Still, policing\
    \ can serve different purposes.  For example, if the\n   objective is to police\
    \ bulk traffic induced by peer networks,\n   additional monitoring functions can\
    \ be placed directly at\n   corresponding ingress points to monitor traffic and\
    \ possibly drive\n   out-of-band functions such as triggering border contract\
    \ penalties.\n   The auditing function, which should be placed at the end of the\
    \ path\n   (at least after/at the last bottleneck), would likely be placed best\n\
    \   on the eNB (wireless base station).\n   For the uplink direction, there are\
    \ naturally different options for\n   designing monitoring and policy enforcement\
    \ functions.  A likely\n   approach can be to monitor congestion exposure on central\
    \ gateway\n   nodes (such as P-GWs) that provide the required interfaces to the\n\
    \   PCRF but to perform policing actions in the access network (i.e., in\n   eNBs).\
    \  For example, the traffic is policed at the ingress before it\n   reaches concentration\
    \ points in the core network.\n   Such a setup would enable all the ConEx use\
    \ cases described in\n   Section 2 without requiring significant changes to the\
    \ EPS\n   architecture.  It would also enable operators to re-use existing\n \
    \  infrastructure, specifically wireless base stations, PCRF, and Home\n   Subscriber\
    \ Server (HSS) systems.\n   For ConEx functions on elements such as the S-GWs\
    \ and P-GWs, it is\n   important to consider mobility and tunneling protocol requirements.\n\
    \   LTE provides two alternative approaches: PMIPv6 [TS23402] and the\n   GPRS\
    \ Tunneling Protocol (GTP).  For the propagation of congestion\n   information\
    \ (responses), tunneling considerations are therefore very\n   important.\n  \
    \ In general, policing will be done based on per-user (per-subscriber)\n   information\
    \ such as congestion quota, current quota usage, etc., and\n   network operator\
    \ policies, e.g., specifying how to react to\n   persistent congestion contribution.\
    \  In the EPS, per-user information\n   is normally part of the user profile (stored\
    \ in the HSS) that would\n   be accessed by PCC entities such as the PCRF for\
    \ dynamic updates,\n   enforcement, etc.\n"
- title: 4.  Summary
  contents:
  - "4.  Summary\n   We have shown how congestion exposure can be useful for efficient\n\
    \   resource management in mobile communication networks.  The premise\n   for\
    \ this discussion was the observation that data communication,\n   specifically\
    \ best-effort bulk data transmission, is becoming a\n   commodity service, whereas\
    \ resources are obviously still limited.\n   This calls for efficient, scalable,\
    \ and yet effective capacity\n   sharing in such networks.\n   ConEx can be a\
    \ mechanism that enables such capacity sharing while\n   allowing operators to\
    \ apply these mechanisms in different ways, e.g.,\n   for implementing different\
    \ use cases as described in Section 2.  It\n   is important to note that ConEx\
    \ is fundamentally a mechanism that can\n   be applied in different ways to realize\
    \ the policies of different\n   operators.\n   ConEx may also be used to complement\
    \ 3GPP-based mechanisms for\n   congestion management that are currently under\
    \ development, such as\n   in the User Plane Congestion Management (UPCON) work\
    \ item described\n   in [TR23705].\n   We have described a few possibilities for\
    \ adding ConEx as a mechanism\n   to 3GPP LTE-based networks and have shown how\
    \ this could be done\n   incrementally (starting with partial deployment).  It\
    \ is quite\n   feasible that such partial deployments be done on a per-operator-\n\
    \   domain basis without requiring changes to standard 3GPP interfaces.\n   For\
    \ network-wide deployment, e.g., with congestion exposure between\n   operators,\
    \ more considerations might be needed.\n   We have also identified a few implications/requirements\
    \ that should\n   be taken into consideration when enabling congestion exposure\
    \ in such\n   networks:\n   Performance:  In mobile communication networks with\
    \ more expensive\n      resources and more stringent QoS requirements, the feasibility\
    \ of\n      applying ConEx as well as its performance and deployment scenarios\n\
    \      need to be examined closer.  For instance, a mobile communication\n   \
    \   network may encounter longer delay and higher loss rates, which\n      can\
    \ impose specific requirements on the timeliness and accuracy of\n      congestion\
    \ exposure information.\n   Mobility:  One of the unique characteristics of cellular\
    \ networks\n      when compared to wired networks is the presence of user mobility.\n\
    \      As the user location changes, the same device can be connected to\n   \
    \   the network via different base stations (eNBs) or even go through\n      switching\
    \ gateways.  Thus, the ConEx scheme must to be able to\n      carry the latest\
    \ congestion information per user/flow across\n      multiple network nodes in\
    \ real time.\n   Multi-access:  In cellular networks, multiple access technologies\
    \ can\n      co-exist.  In such cases, a user can use multiple access\n      technologies\
    \ for multiple applications or even a single\n      application simultaneously.\
    \  If the congestion policies are set\n      based on each user, then ConEx should\
    \ have the capability to\n      enable information exchange across multiple access\
    \ domains.\n   Tunneling:  Both 3G and LTE networks make extensive usage of\n\
    \      tunneling.  The ConEx mechanism should be designed in a way to\n      support\
    \ usage with different tunneling protocols such as PMIPv6\n      and GTP.  For\
    \ ECN-based congestion notification, [RFC6040]\n      specifies how the ECN field\
    \ of the IP header should be constructed\n      on entry and exit from IP-in-IP\
    \ tunnels.\n   Roaming:  Independent of the specific architecture, mobile\n  \
    \    communication networks typically differentiate between non-roaming\n    \
    \  and roaming scenarios.  Roaming scenarios are typically more\n      demanding\
    \ regarding implementing operator policies, charging, etc.\n      It can be expected\
    \ that this would also hold for deploying ConEx.\n      A more detailed analysis\
    \ of this problem will be provided in a\n      future revision of this document.\n\
    \   It is important to note that ConEx is intended to be used as a\n   supplement\
    \ and not a replacement to the existing QoS mechanisms in\n   mobile networks.\
    \  For example, ConEx deployed in 3GPP mobile networks\n   can provide useful\
    \ input to the existing 3GPP PCC mechanisms by\n   supplying more dynamic network\
    \ information to supplement the fairly\n   static information used by the PCC.\
    \  This would enable the mobile\n   network to make better policy control decisions\
    \ than is possible with\n   only static information.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   For any ConEx deployment, it is important to\
    \ apply appropriate\n   mechanisms to preclude applications and senders from misstating\
    \ their\n   congestion contribution.  [RFC7713] discusses this problem in detail\n\
    \   and introduces the ConEx auditing concept.  ConEx auditing can be\n   performed\
    \ in different ways -- for example, flows can be constantly\n   audited or only\
    \ audited on demand when network operators decide to do\n   so.  Also, coarse-grained\
    \ auditing may operate on flow aggregates for\n   efficiency reasons, whereas\
    \ fine-grained auditing would inspect\n   individual flows.  In mobile networks,\
    \ there may be deployment\n   strategies that favor efficiency over very exact\
    \ auditing.  It is\n   important to understand the trade-offs and to apply ConEx\
    \ auditing\n   appropriately.\n   The ConEx protocol specifications [CONEX-DESTOPT]\
    \ and [TCP-MOD]\n   discuss additional security considerations that would also\
    \ apply to\n   mobile network deployments.\n"

  - "Appendix A.  Overview of 3GPP's EPS\n   This section provides an overview of\
    \ the 3GPP \"Evolved Packet System\"\n   (EPS [TS36300] [TS23401]) as a specific\
    \ example of a mobile\n   communication architecture.  Of course, other architectures\
    \ exist,\n   but the EPS is used as one example to demonstrate the applicability\n\
    \   of congestion exposure concepts and mechanisms.\n   The EPS architecture and\
    \ some of its standardized interfaces are\n   depicted in Figure 5.  The EPS provides\
    \ IP connectivity to UE (i.e.,\n   mobile nodes) and access to operator services,\
    \ such as global\n   Internet access and voice communications.  The EPS comprises\
    \ the\n   radio access network called Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio\n  \
    \ Access Network (E-UTRAN) and the core network called the Evolved\n   Packet\
    \ Core (EPC).  QoS is supported through an EPS bearer concept,\n   providing bindings\
    \ to resource reservation within the network.\n                              \

    \ Interface\n   The Evolved NodeB (eNB), the LTE base station, is part of the\
    \ access\n   network that provides radio resource management, header compression,\n\
    \   security, and connectivity to the core network through the S1\n   interface.\
    \  In an LTE network, the control-plane signaling traffic\n   and the data traffic\
    \ are handled separately.  The eNBs transmit the\n   control traffic and data\
    \ traffic separately via two logically\n   separate interfaces.\n   The Home Subscriber\
    \ Server (HSS) is a database that contains user\n   subscriptions and QoS profiles.\
    \  The Mobility Management Entity (MME)\n   is responsible for mobility management,\
    \ user authentication, bearer\n   establishment and modification, and maintenance\
    \ of the UE context.\n   The Serving Gateway (S-GW) is the mobility anchor and\
    \ manages the\n   user-plane data tunnels during the inter-eNB handovers.  It\
    \ tunnels\n   all user data packets and buffers downlink IP packets destined for\n\
    \   UEs that happen to be in idle mode.\n   The PDN Gateway (P-GW) is responsible\
    \ for IP address allocation to\n   the UE and is a tunnel endpoint for user-plane\
    \ and control-plane\n   protocols.  It is also responsible for charging, packet\
    \ filtering,\n   and policy-based control of flows.  It interconnects the mobile\n\
    \   network to external IP networks, e.g., the Internet.\n   In this architecture,\
    \ data packets are not sent directly on an IP\n   network between the eNB and\
    \ the gateways.  Instead, every packet is\n   tunneled over a tunneling protocol\
    \ -- the GPRS Tunneling Protocol\n   (GTP) [TS29060] over UDP/IP.  A GTP path\
    \ is identified in each node\n   with the IP address and a UDP port number on\
    \ the eNB/gateways.  The\n   GTP protocol carries both the data traffic (GTP-U\
    \ tunnels) and the\n   control traffic (GTP-C tunnels [TS29274]).  Alternatively,\
    \ PMIPv6 is\n   used on the S5 interface between S-GW and P-GW.\n   The above\
    \ is very different from an end-to-end path on the Internet\n   where the packet\
    \ forwarding is performed at the IP level.\n   Importantly, we observe that these\
    \ tunneling protocols give the\n   operator a large degree of flexibility to control\
    \ the congestion\n   mechanism incorporated with the GTP/PMIPv6 protocols.\n"
