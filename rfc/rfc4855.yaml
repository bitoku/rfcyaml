- title: 2.  Procedure For Registering Media Types for RTP Payload Types
  contents:
  - "2.  Procedure For Registering Media Types for RTP Payload Types\n   Registering\
    \ an RTP payload type as a media type follows the same\n   procedures as described\
    \ in RFC 4288 [1] and uses the registration\n   template shown in Section 10 of\
    \ that RFC.  To specify how the\n   particular payload format is transported over\
    \ RTP, some additional\n   information is required in the following sections of\
    \ that template:\n     Required parameters:\n          If the payload format does\
    \ not have a fixed RTP timestamp\n          clock rate, then a \"rate\" parameter\
    \ is required to specify the\n          RTP timestamp clock rate.  A particular\
    \ payload format may\n          have additional required parameters.\n     Optional\
    \ parameters:\n          Most audio payload formats can have an optional \"channels\"\
    \n          parameter to specify the number of audio channels included in\n  \
    \        the transmission.  The default channel order is as specified\n      \
    \    in RFC 3551 [4].  Any payload format, but most likely audio\n          formats,\
    \ may also include the optional parameters \"ptime\" to\n          specify the\
    \ recommended length of time in milliseconds\n          represented by the media\
    \ in a packet, and/or \"maxptime\" to\n          specify the maximum amount of\
    \ media that can be encapsulated\n          in each packet, expressed as time\
    \ in milliseconds.  The\n          \"ptime\" and \"maxptime\" parameters are defined\
    \ in the Session\n          Description Protocol (SDP) [5].\n          A particular\
    \ payload format may have additional optional\n          parameters.  As allowed\
    \ in Section 4.3 of [1], new parameters\n          MAY be added to RTP media types\
    \ that have been previously\n          defined, but the new parameters MUST NOT\
    \ change existing\n          functionality and it MUST be possible for existing\n\
    \          implementations to ignore the additional parameters without\n     \
    \     impairing operation.\n     Encoding considerations:\n          Most RTP\
    \ payload formats include binary or framed data as\n          described in Section\
    \ 4.8 of [1].  The appropriate encoding\n          considerations MUST be noted.\n\
    \     Published specification:\n          A description of the media encoding\
    \ and a specification of the\n          payload format must be provided, usually\
    \ by reference to an\n          RTP payload format specification RFC.  That RFC\
    \ may be\n          separate, or the media type registration may be incorporated\n\
    \          into the payload format specification RFC.  The payload format\n  \
    \        specification MUST include the RTP timestamp clock rate (or\n       \
    \   multiple rates for audio encodings with multiple sampling\n          rates).\n\
    \          A reference to a further description of the data compression\n    \
    \      format itself should be provided, if available.\n     Restrictions on usage:\n\
    \          The fact that the media type is defined for transfer via RTP\n    \
    \      MUST be noted, in particular, if the transfer depends on RTP\n        \
    \  framing and hence the media type is only defined for transfer\n          via\
    \ RTP.\n   Depending on whether or not the type has already been registered for\n\
    \   transfer with a non-RTP protocol (e.g., MIME mail or http), several\n   different\
    \ cases can occur:\n      a) Not yet registered as a media type\n         A new\
    \ registration should be constructed using the media type\n         registration\
    \ template.  The registration may specify transfer\n         via other means in\
    \ addition to RTP if that is feasible and\n         desired.  The appropriate\
    \ encoding considerations must be\n         specified, and the restrictions on\
    \ usage must specify whether\n         the type is only defined for transfer via\
    \ RTP or via other\n         modes as well.\n         Optional parameters may\
    \ be defined as needed, and it must be\n         clearly stated to which mode(s)\
    \ of transfer the parameters\n         apply.\n      b) Media type exists for\
    \ a non-RTP protocol\n         The restrictions on usage of the existing type\
    \ should be\n         changed, if present, or added, if not, to indicate that\
    \ the\n         type can also be transferred via RTP.\n         RTP-specific parameters\
    \ may be added, and it must be clearly\n         stated that these are only to\
    \ be used when the media type is\n         transmitted via RTP transport.\n  \
    \    c) Update an existing media type for RTP to be used for a non-RTP\n     \
    \    protocol\n         The restrictions on usage of the existing type should\
    \ be\n         changed to indicate that the type can also be transferred via a\n\
    \         non-RTP protocol (e.g., SMTP, HTTP).\n         Non-RTP-specific parameters\
    \ can be added, and it must be\n         clearly stated that these are only to\
    \ be used when the media\n         type is transmitted via a non-RTP transport.\n"

- title: 2.2.  Restrictions on Sharing a Subtype Name
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Restrictions on Sharing a Subtype Name\n   The same media subtype name\
    \ MUST NOT be shared for RTP and non-RTP\n   (file-based) transfer methods unless\
    \ the data format is the same for\n   both methods.  The data format is considered\
    \ to be the same if the\n   file format is equivalent to a concatenated sequence\
    \ of payloads from\n   RTP packets not including the RTP header or any RTP payload-format\n\
    \   header.\n   The file format MAY include a magic number or other header at\
    \ the\n   start of the file that is not included when the data is transferred\n\
    \   via RTP.\n   A second requirement for sharing a media subtype name is that\
    \ the\n   sets of required parameters must be the same for both methods.\n   For\
    \ cases where the data format or required parameters cannot be the\n   same for\
    \ RTP and non-RTP transfer methods, the data formats MUST be\n   registered as\
    \ separate types.  It is RECOMMENDED that the subtype\n   names be related, such\
    \ as by using a common root plus a suffix.  For\n   those cases where a suffix\
    \ is applied in the subtype name for the RTP\n   transfer method, the suffix \"\
    +rtp\" is suggested.\n"
- title: 3.  Mapping to SDP Parameters
  contents:
  - "3.  Mapping to SDP Parameters\n   The representation of a media type is specified\
    \ in the syntax of the\n   Content-Type header field in RFC 2045 [6] as follows:\n\
    \        type \"/\" subtype  *(\";\" parameter)\n   Parameters may be required\
    \ for a particular type or subtype or they\n   may be optional.  For media types\
    \ that represent RTP payload formats,\n   the parameters \"rate\", \"channels\"\
    , \"ptime\", and \"maxptime\" have\n   general definitions (given above) that\
    \ may apply across types and\n   subtypes.  The format for a parameter is specified\
    \ in RFC 2045 as\n        attribute \"=\" value\n   where attribute is the parameter\
    \ name and the permissible values are\n   specified for each parameter.  RFC 2045\
    \ specifies that a value MUST\n   be present and that the value MUST be a quoted\
    \ string if it contains\n   any of the special characters listed in that RFC.\n\
    \   The information carried in the media type string has a specific\n   mapping\
    \ to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [5],\n   which is commonly\
    \ used to describe RTP sessions.  The mapping is as\n   follows:\n      o  The\
    \ media type (e.g., audio) goes in SDP \"m=\" as the media\n         name.\n \
    \     o  The media subtype (payload format) goes in SDP \"a=rtpmap\" as\n    \
    \     the encoding name.\n      o  The general (possibly optional) parameters\
    \ \"rate\" and\n         \"channels\" also go in \"a=rtpmap\" as clock rate and\
    \ encoding\n         parameters, respectively.\n      o  The general (and optional)\
    \ parameters \"ptime\" and \"maxptime\" go\n         in the SDP \"a=ptime\" and\
    \ \"a=maxptime\" attributes, respectively.\n      o  Any payload-format-specific\
    \ parameters go in the SDP \"a=fmtp\"\n         attribute.  The set of allowed\
    \ parameters is defined by the RFC\n         that specifies the payload format\
    \ and MUST NOT be extended by\n         the media type registration without a\
    \ corresponding revision of\n         the payload format specification.  The format\
    \ and syntax of\n         these parameters may also be defined by the payload\
    \ format\n         specification, but it is suggested that the parameters be\n\
    \         copied directly from the media type string as a semicolon\n        \
    \ separated list of parameter=value pairs.  For payload formats\n         that\
    \ specify some other syntax for the fmtp parameters, the\n         registration\
    \ of that payload format as a media type must\n         specify what the parameters\
    \ are in MIME format and how to map\n         them to the \"a=fmtp\" attribute.\n\
    \   An example mapping is as follows:\n         audio/L16; rate=48000; channels=2;\
    \ ptime=5; emphasis=50-15\n         m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 97\n         a=rtpmap:97\
    \ L16/48000/2\n         a=fmtp:97 emphasis=50-15\n         a=ptime:5\n   Note\
    \ that the payload format (encoding) names defined in the RTP\n   Profile [4]\
    \ are commonly shown in upper case.  Media subtype names\n   are commonly shown\
    \ in lower case.  These names are case-insensitive\n   in both places.  Similarly,\
    \ parameter names are case-insensitive both\n   in media type strings and in the\
    \ default mapping to the SDP a=fmtp\n   attribute.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Changes from RFC 3555\n   This document updates RFC 3555 to conform to the\
    \ revised media type\n   registration procedures in RFC 4288 [1].  Whereas RFC\
    \ 3555 required\n   the encoding considerations to specify transfer via RTP, that\
    \ is now\n   specified under restrictions on usage.  This document also specifies\n\
    \   the conditions under which new optional parameters may be added to a\n   previously\
    \ defined RTP media type and adds a new Section 2.2 to\n   clarify the requirements\
    \ for sharing a media type among RTP and non-\n   RTP transfer methods.\n   RFC\
    \ 3555 included media type registrations for the RTP payload\n   formats defined\
    \ in the RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences,\n   RFC 3551 [4].  Those\
    \ media type registrations have been removed from\n   this document.  Some of\
    \ them have been assembled into a separate\n   companion RFC 4856 [8], leaving\
    \ out those that have been, or are\n   intended to be, registered in revisions\
    \ of their own payload format\n   specification RFCs.\n   Philipp Hoschka is a\
    \ co-author of RFC 3555; his contributions to the\n   foundation of this document\
    \ are appreciated.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The media type registration procedure specified\
    \ in this memo does not\n   impose any security considerations on its own.  Also,\
    \ registrations\n   conforming to this procedure do not themselves impose security\
    \ risks.\n   However, use of the media type being registered could very well\n\
    \   impose security risks:\n      o  Any media type that contains \"active content\"\
    \ imposes the risk\n         of malicious side-effects unless execution of that\
    \ content is\n         adequately constrained.\n      o  Several audio and video\
    \ encodings are perfect for hiding data\n         using steganography.\n     \
    \ o  The RTP specification, RFC 3550, provides security\n         considerations\
    \ for the transport of audio and video data over\n         RTP, including the\
    \ use of encryption where confidentiality is\n         required.\n   Therefore,\
    \ each media type registration is required to state any\n   security considerations\
    \ that apply to the use of that type.  The\n   remainder of this section is copied\
    \ from RFC 4288 [1], which\n   specifies media type registration procedures in\
    \ general.\n   An analysis of security issues MUST be done for all types registered\n\
    \   in the standards tree.  A similar analysis for media types registered\n  \
    \ in the vendor or personal trees is encouraged but not required.\n   However,\
    \ regardless of what security analysis has or has not been\n   done, all descriptions\
    \ of security issues MUST be as accurate as\n   possible regardless of registration\
    \ tree.  In particular, a statement\n   that there are \"no security issues associated\
    \ with this type\" MUST\n   NOT be confused with \"the security issues associated\
    \ with this type\n   have not been assessed\".\n   There is absolutely no requirement\
    \ that media types registered in any\n   tree be secure or completely free from\
    \ risks.  Nevertheless, all\n   known security risks MUST be identified in the\
    \ registration of a\n   media type, again regardless of registration tree.\n \
    \  The security considerations section of all registrations is subject\n   to\
    \ continuing evaluation and modification, and in particular MAY be\n   extended\
    \ by use of the \"comments on media types\" mechanism described\n   in RFC 4288,\
    \ Section 6.\n   Some of the issues that should be looked at in a security analysis\
    \ of\n   a media type are:\n      o  Complex media types may include provisions\
    \ for directives that\n         institute actions on a recipient's files or other\
    \ resources.\n         In many cases, provision is made for originators to specify\n\
    \         arbitrary actions in an unrestricted fashion that may then have\n  \
    \       devastating effects.  See the registration of the\n         application/postscript\
    \ media type in RFC 2046 [7] for an\n         example of such directives and how\
    \ they should be described in\n         a media type registration.\n      o  All\
    \ registrations MUST state whether or not they employ such\n         \"active\
    \ content\", and if they do, they MUST state what steps\n         have been taken\
    \ to protect users of the media type from harm.\n      o  Complex media types\
    \ may include provisions for directives that\n         institute actions that,\
    \ while not directly harmful to the\n         recipient, may result in disclosure\
    \ of information that either\n         facilitates a subsequent attack or else\
    \ violates a recipient's\n         privacy in some way.  Again, the registration\
    \ of the\n         application/postscript media type illustrates how such\n  \
    \       directives can be handled.\n      o  A media type that employs compression\
    \ may provide an\n         opportunity for sending a small amount of data that,\
    \ when\n         received and evaluated, expands enormously to consume all of\n\
    \         the recipient's resources.  All media types SHOULD state\n         whether\
    \ or not they employ compression, and if they do they\n         should discuss\
    \ what steps need to be taken to avoid such\n         attacks.\n      o  A media\
    \ type might be targeted for applications that require\n         some sort of\
    \ security assurance but not provide the necessary\n         security mechanisms\
    \ themselves.  For example, a media type\n         could be defined for storage\
    \ of confidential medical\n         information that in turn requires an external\
    \ confidentiality\n         service or is designed for use only within a secure\n\
    \         environment.\n"
