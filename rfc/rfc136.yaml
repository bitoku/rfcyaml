  - "             Host Accounting and Administrative Procedures\n   A plan must be\
    \ formulated and agreed upon for the development of a\n   Host accounting system\
    \ in the ARPA Network.  Such a plan should take\n   into consideration both current\
    \ Host accounting practices and new\n   technical contributions.  This document\
    \ is an early attempt to\n   identify the issues concerning Host accounting. \
    \ It is being\n   distributed as a working document on which further discussions\
    \ may be\n   based and, as such, does not represent, nor is intended to represent,\n\
    \   a position on any of these issues.\n   The method of network operation and\
    \ the potential for its growth are\n   relevant factors to be considered in formulating\
    \ a plan for Host\n   accounting.  For example, the answers to the following questions\n\
    \   provide a useful background for reference:\n      1.  Who or what operates\
    \ the Network?\n      2.  What is the criteria upon which new sites should be\n\
    \          incorporated into the Network?\n      3.  What regulations, if any,\
    \ apply to the connection of non-ARPA\n          sites?\n      4.  What is the\
    \ relation, if any, between the ARPA Network and\n          common carrier services?\n\
    \      5.  What procedures are required to bring new sites on board and\n    \
    \      up to speed?\n      6.  What is the most effective way to characterize\
    \ their\n          resources?\n      7.  What usage of other Network resources\
    \ do they anticipate?\n      8.  What procedures will be required for a typical\
    \ user to obtain\n          access to that Host?\n      9.  What is their charging\
    \ policy and for what items?\n      10.  Are their rates in accordance with government\
    \ standards?\n"
- title: Assumptions Regarding the Network
  contents:
  - "Assumptions Regarding the Network\n   I have made several assumptions in this\
    \ presentation that should\n   simplify and, hopefully, clarify the framework\
    \ in which the\n   accounting issues reside.  Any one of these assumptions may\
    \ be\n   subject to challenge.\n   1. Subnet Considerations\n      1.1 That some\
    \ entity, government or private, will undertake to\n          operate the subnet\
    \ and will act as a cost center for the\n          subnet.\n      1.2 That the\
    \ total cost of operating the subnet (equipment,\n          development, maintenance,\
    \ service and other administrative\n          costs) will be assumed by the cost\
    \ center which will be\n          reimbursed by the Host sites or directly by\
    \ ARPA on both a\n          connect and usage basis.\n      1.3 That the subnet\
    \ will be initially operated as part of a\n          private government-sponsored\
    \ resource-sharing network for the\n          use of its participants in obtaining\
    \ computer services and not\n          as a common carrier for the sale of communication\
    \ services.\n      1.4 That both ARPA and non-ARPA supported contractors will\n\
    \          eventually be allowed to connect.  The use of the subnet may\n    \
    \      be administered to support resource-sharing activities.\n   2. Host Considerations\n\
    \      2.1 That each serving Host will make arrangements for use of its\n    \
    \      facilities and arrange to obtain payment either from its own\n        \
    \  ARPA contract, directly from the using Host, or from the using\n          Host\
    \ via an intermediate mechanism.\n      2.2 That each prospective Host site will\
    \ make available (in some\n          way to be designated) figures on cost of\
    \ usage for relevant\n          facilities such as cpu, storage, connect time,\
    \ peripherals,\n          etc.  It will further indicate, where appropriate, the\
    \ status\n          of equipment (such as government-furnished, leased, or\n \
    \         privately owned) and whether the rates are in accord with\n        \
    \  government standards.\n      2.3 That the implementation of standard automated\
    \ accounting\n          procedures involving the use of the Network will be deferred\n\
    \          until non-automated procedures have been understood and\n         \
    \ stabilized.  Early experimentation in this area is\n          appropriate, however.\n\
    \      2.4 That no major change in current Host accounting procedures\n      \
    \    should be required initially.\n   3. Both Host and Subnet Considerations\n\
    \      3.1 That two kinds of traffic into the Network will be measured by\n  \
    \        the network, namely traffic to Hosts at other sites and\n          traffic\
    \ to Hosts at the same site.\n      3.2 The Network cost center will record traffic\
    \ out of each Host\n          but will not initially keep records of traffic on\
    \ a Host/Host\n          basis or on a link or socket basis.  Each Host will be\n\
    \          responsible for distributing the cost of Network usage among\n    \
    \      the appropriate users.\n      3.3 That some form of duplication, verification,\
    \ or backup of\n          accounting information may become desirable.\n     \
    \ 3.4 Understanding the relationship between service, improvement,\n         \
    \ reliability and cost should be the responsibility of the\n          Network\
    \ operator, but that feedback from the Host sites in\n          this area is absolutely\
    \ essential.\n"
- title: Suggested Topics
  contents:
  - "Suggested Topics\n   The following set of topics are introduced for discussion\
    \ among the\n   network community.\n   1. Current Practices\n      1.1 What constitutes\
    \ current Host accounting procedures? How is it\n          accomplished and what\
    \ is accounted for?\n   2. Administrative Procedures\n      2.1 What access arrangements\
    \ for network users are either planned\n          or envisioned at each site?\n\
    \      2.2 Are security or authenticity provisions required for network\n    \
    \      usage and if so, what is the nature of that requirement?\n      2.3 Should\
    \ Host accounting and network accounting be completely\n          independent\
    \ of each other or not? If not, in what way should\n          they be made independent?\n\
    \      2.4 What long range billing procedures are desirable?\n   3. Charging Policies\n\
    \      3.1 What procedures are required for a Host to determine the most\n   \
    \       cost effective way to run a job on the Network? In this\n          regard,\
    \ is it helpful to try to categorize resources for\n          costing purposes?\n\
    \      3.2 Should some classes of Host activity be exempt from\n          accounting?\n\
    \      3.3 Is it desirable to achieve standardized rates for specific\n      \
    \    classes of activity, and if so how should those rates be\n          determined?\n\
    \   4. Technical Aspects\n      4.1 Should Host accounting information eventually\
    \ flow via the\n          Network? Should it be accessible to a user or a Host\
    \ in real-\n          time? If so, what should flow online?\n      4.2 What accounting\
    \ mechanisms, if any, are needed to deal with\n          events, from which recovery\
    \ or continuation is not possible\n          that result from use of the Network\
    \ and lack of proximity to\n          the computer? To what extent are the procedures\
    \ in current use\n          for remote users from the dial-up network applicable?\n\
    \      4.3 For what classes of Host Network activity, if any, is\n          conventional\
    \ logging-in not a desirable long-range strategy?\n   This list of topics is not\
    \ intended to be complete or even very\n   specific.  Suggestions for additional\
    \ topics are not only welcomed\n   but encouraged.\n         [ This RFC was put\
    \ into machine readable form for entry ]\n             [ into the online RFC archives\
    \ by Sergio Kleiman]\n"
