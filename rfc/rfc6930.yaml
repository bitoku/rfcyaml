  - "1.  Introduction\n   Recently, providers have started to deploy IPv6 and to consider\n\
    \   transition to IPv6.  The IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6rd) [RFC5969]\n   provides\
    \ both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously\n   during the IPv4/IPv6\
    \ coexistence period.  6rd is used to provide IPv6\n   connectivity service through\
    \ legacy IPv4-only infrastructure.  6rd\n   uses the Dynamic Host Configuration\
    \ Protocol (DHCP) [RFC2131], and\n   the 6rd Customer Edge (CE) uses the DHCP\
    \ 6rd option [RFC5969] to\n   discover a 6rd Border Relay and to configure an\
    \ IPv6 prefix and\n   address.\n   In many networks, user-configuration information\
    \ is managed by\n   Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) servers.\
    \  The\n   Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) protocol\n   [RFC2865]\
    \ is usually used by AAA servers to communicate with network\n   elements.  In\
    \ a fixed-line broadband network, the Broadband Network\n   Gateways (BNGs) act\
    \ as the access gateway for users.  The BNGs are\n   assumed to embed a DHCP server\
    \ function that allows them to handle\n   locally any DHCP requests issued by\
    \ hosts.\n   Since the 6rd configuration information is stored in AAA servers,\
    \ and\n   user configuration is mainly through DHCP between BNGs and hosts/CEs,\n\
    \   new RADIUS attributes are needed to propagate the information from\n   AAA\
    \ servers to BNGs.\n"

    \ DHCP and RADIUS\n                 When Combined with RADIUS Authentication\n\
    \   The BNG acts as a client of RADIUS and as a DHCP server.  First, the\n   6rd\
    \ CE MAY initiate a DHCPDISCOVER message that includes a Parameter\n   Request\
    \ option (55) [RFC2132] with the 6rd option [RFC5969].  When\n   the BNG receives\
    \ the DHCPDISCOVER, it SHOULD initiate a RADIUS\n   Access- Request message to\
    \ the RADIUS server. In that message,\n   -  the User-Name attribute (1) SHOULD\
    \ be filled by the 6rd CE MAC\n      address, and\n   -  the User-Password attribute\
    \ (2) SHOULD be filled by the shared 6rd\n      password that has been preconfigured\
    \ on the DHCP server.\n   The BNG requests authentication, as defined in [RFC2865],\
    \ with the\n   IPv6-6rd-Configuration attribute (Section 4.1) in the desired\n\
    \   attribute list.  If the authentication request is approved by the AAA\n  \
    \ server, an Access-Accept message MUST be acknowledged with the\n   IPv6-6rd-Configuration\
    \ attribute.  Then, the BNG SHOULD respond to\n   the 6rd CE with a DHCPOFFER\
    \ message, which contains a DHCP 6rd\n   option.  The recommended format of the\
    \ MAC address is as defined in\n   Calling-Station-Id ([RFC3580], Section 3.20)\
    \ without the SSID\n   (Service Set Identifier) portion.\n   Figure 2 describes\
    \ another scenario -- later re-authorization -- in\n   which the authorization\
    \ operation is not coupled with authentication.\n   Authorization relevant to\
    \ 6rd is done independently after the\n   authentication process.\n      6rd CE\

    \           Figure 2: The Cooperation between DHCP and RADIUS\n              \
    \   When Decoupled from RADIUS Authentication\n   In this scenario, the Access-Request\
    \ packet SHOULD contain a Service-\n   Type attribute (6) with the value Authorize\
    \ Only (17); thus,\n   according to [RFC5080], the Access-Request packet MUST\
    \ contain a\n   State attribute that it obtains from the previous authentication\n\
    \   process.\n   In both above-mentioned scenarios, Message-Authenticator (type\
    \ 80)\n   [RFC2865] SHOULD be used to protect both Access-Request and Access-\n\
    \   Accept messages.\n   After receiving the IPv6-6rd-Configuration attribute\
    \ in the initial\n   Access-Accept, the BNG SHOULD store the received 6rd configuration\n\
    \   parameters locally.  When the 6rd CE sends a DHCP Request message to\n   request\
    \ an extension of the lifetime for the assigned address, the\n   BNG does not\
    \ have to initiate a new Access-Request towards the AAA\n   server to request\
    \ the 6rd configuration parameters.  The BNG could\n   retrieve the previously\
    \ stored 6rd configuration parameters and use\n   them in its reply.\n   If the\
    \ BNG does not receive the IPv6-6rd-Configuration attribute in\n   the Access-Accept,\
    \ it MAY fall back to a preconfigured default 6rd\n   configuration, if any. \
    \ If the BNG does not have any preconfigured\n   default 6rd configuration or\
    \ if the BNG receives an Access-Reject,\n   the tunnel cannot be established.\n\
    \   As specified in [RFC2131], Section 4.4.5 (\"Reacquisition and\n   expiration\"\
    ), if the DHCP server to which the DHCP Request message\n   was sent at time T1\
    \ has not responded by time T2 (typically\n   0.375*duration_of_lease after T1),\
    \ the 6rd CE (the DHCP client)\n   SHOULD enter the REBINDING state and attempt\
    \ to contact any server.\n   In this situation, the secondary BNG receiving the\
    \ new DHCP message\n   MUST initiate a new Access-Request towards the AAA server.\
    \  The\n   secondary BNG MAY include the IPv6-6rd-Configuration attribute in its\n\
    \   Access-Request.\n"

    \ with a\n   default 6rd configuration, these parameters MAY be inserted in the\n\
    \   attribute.  The RADIUS server MAY ignore the hint sent by the BNG,\n   and\
    \ it MAY assign different 6rd parameters.\n   If the BNG includes the IPv6-6rd-Configuration\
    \ attribute, but the AAA\n   server does not recognize it, this attribute MUST\
    \ be ignored by the\n   AAA server.\n   If the BNG does not receive the IPv6-6rd-Configuration\
    \ attribute in\n   the Access-Accept, it MAY fallback to a preconfigured default\
    \ 6rd\n   configuration, if any.  If the BNG does not have any preconfigured\n\
    \   default 6rd configuration, the 6rd tunnel cannot be established.\n   If the\
    \ BNG is pre-provisioned with a default 6rd configuration and\n   the 6rd configuration\
    \ received in Access-Accept is different from the\n   configured default, then\
    \ the 6rd configuration received in the\n   Access-Accept message MUST be used\
    \ for the session.\n   If the BNG cannot support the received 6rd configuration\

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   In 6rd scenarios, both CE and BNG are within\
    \ a provider network,\n   which can be considered as a closed network and a lower-threat\n\
    \   environment.  A similar consideration can be applied to the RADIUS\n   message\
    \ exchange between the BNG and the AAA server.\n   In 6rd scenarios, the RADIUS\
    \ protocol is run over IPv4.  Known\n   security vulnerabilities of the RADIUS\
    \ protocol are discussed in\n   [RFC2607], [RFC2865], and [RFC2869].  Use of IPsec\
    \ [RFC4301] for\n   providing security when RADIUS is carried in IPv6 is discussed\
    \ in\n   [RFC3162].\n   To get unauthorized 6rd configuration information, a malicious\
    \ user\n   may use MAC address spoofing and/or a dictionary attack on the shared\n\
    \   6rd password that has been preconfigured on the DHCP server.  The\n   relevant\
    \ security issues have been considered in Section 12 of\n   [RFC5969].\n   Security\
    \ issues that may arise specifically between the 6rd CE and\n   BNG are discussed\
    \ in [RFC5969].  Furthermore, generic DHCP security\n   mechanisms can be applied\
    \ to DHCP intercommunication between 6rd CE\n   and BNG.\n   Security considerations\
    \ for the Diameter protocol are discussed in\n   [RFC6733].\n"
