- title: 3.   Introduction
  contents:
  - "3.   Introduction\n   The CableLabs Client Configuration Option [1] defines several\n\
    \   sub-options used to configure devices deployed into CableLabs\n   architectures.\
    \  These architectures implement the PacketCable\n   Security Specification [4]\
    \ (based on Kerberos V5 [5]), to support CCD\n   authentication and establishment\
    \ of security associations between\n   CCDs and application servers.\n   CCDs\
    \ are permitted to retain security tickets in local persistent\n   storage.  Thus\
    \ a power-cycled CCD is enabled to avoid expensive\n   ticket acquisition for\
    \ locally persisted, non-expired tickets.  This\n   feature greatly reduces the\
    \ security overhead of a deployment.\n   This sub-option allows the service provider\
    \ to control the lifetime\n   of tickets persisted locally on a CCD.  The service\
    \ provider requires\n   this capability to support operational functions such\
    \ as forcing re-\n   establishment of security associations, remote testing, and\
    \ remote\n   diagnostic of CCDs.\n   It should be noted that, although based on\
    \ the Kerberos V5 RFC [5],\n   the PacketCable Security Specification is not a\
    \ strict implementation\n   of this RFC.  See [4] for details of the PacketCable\
    \ Security\n   Specification.\n"
- title: 4.   Security Ticket Control Sub-option
  contents:
  - "4.   Security Ticket Control Sub-option\n   This sub-option defines a Ticket\
    \ Control Mask (TCM) that instructs\n   the CCD to validate/invalidate specific\
    \ application server tickets.\n   The sub-option is encoded as follows:\n    Code\
    \   Len      TCM\n   +-----+-----+-----+-----+\n   |  9  |  2  | m1  | m2  |\n\
    \   +-----+-----+-----+-----+\n   The length MUST be 2.  The TCM field is encoded\
    \ as an unsigned 16 bit\n   quantity per network byte order.  Each bit of the\
    \ TCM is assigned to\n   a specific server or server group.  A bit value of 0\
    \ means the CCD\n   MUST apply normal invalidation rules (defined in [4]) to the\
    \ locally\n   persisted ticket for the server/server group. A bit value of 1 means\n\
    \   the CCD MUST immediately invalidate the locally persisted ticket for\n   the\
    \ server/server group.\n   Bit #0 is the least significant bit of the field. \
    \ The bit positions\n   are assigned as follows:\n      Bit #0 - the PacketCable\
    \ Provisioning Server used by the CCD.\n      Bit #1 - the group of all PacketCable\
    \ Call Management Servers used\n      by the CCD.\n      Bit #2 - #15.  Reserved\
    \ and MUST be set to 0.\n   If a CCD does not locally store tickets, it MUST ignore\
    \ this\n   sub-option.  Bit values not known to the CCD MUST be ignored.\n"
- title: 5.   IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.   IANA Considerations\n   IANA has assigned a sub-option code to this sub-option\
    \ from the\n   \"CableLabs Client Configuration\" sub-option number space (maintained\n\
    \   within the BOOTP-DHCP Parameters Registry).\n   IANA has also set-up a new\
    \ registry and will maintain a new number\n   space of \"CableLabs Client Configuration\
    \ Option Ticket Control Mask\n   Bit Definitions\", located in the BOOTP-DHCP\
    \ Parameters Registry.  The\n   initial bit definitions are described in section\
    \ 4 of this document.\n   IANA will register future bit mask definitions via an\
    \ \"IETF\n   Consensus\" approval policy as described in RFC 2434 [3].\n"
- title: 6.   Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.   Security Considerations\n   Potential DHCP protocol attack exposure is discussed\
    \ in section 7 of\n   the DHCP protocol specification [6] and in Authentication\
    \ for DHCP\n   Messages [7].  Additional CCC attack exposure is discussed in [1].\n\
    \   The STC sub-option could be used to disrupt a CableLabs architecture\n   deployment.\
    \  In the specific case of PacketCable [8], a deployment\n   could be disrupted\
    \ if a large number of MTAs are reset/power cycled,\n   initiate their provisioning\
    \ flow [9], and are instructed by a\n   malicious DHCP server to invalidate all\
    \ security tickets.  This could\n   lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition\
    \ as this large set of MTAs\n   simultaneously attempt to authenticate and obtain\
    \ tickets from the\n   security infrastructure.\n   However, the scenario described\
    \ above is unlikely to occur. Within\n   the cable delivery architecture required\
    \ by the various CableLabs\n   projects, the DHCP client is connected to a network\
    \ through a cable\n   modem and the CMTS (head-end router).  The CMTS is explicitly\n\
    \   configured with a set of valid DHCP server addresses to which DHCP\n   requests\
    \ are forwarded.  Further, a correctly configured CMTS will\n   only allow DHCP\
    \ downstream traffic from specific DHCP server\n   addresses.\n   It should be\
    \ noted that the downstream filtering of DHCP packets will\n   not prevent spoofed\
    \ DHCP servers behind the CMTS, but the network\n   infrastructure behind the\
    \ CMTS is assumed to be closely controlled by\n   the service provider.\n"
