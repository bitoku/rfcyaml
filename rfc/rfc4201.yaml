- title: 2.  Link Bundling
  contents:
  - "2.  Link Bundling\n   As defined in [GMPLS-ROUTING], a traffic engineering (TE)\
    \ link is a\n   logical construct that represents a way to group/map information\n\
    \   about certain physical resources (and their properties) that\n   interconnect\
    \ LSRs with information that is used by Constrained SPF\n   (for the purpose of\
    \ path computation) and by GMPLS signaling.\n   As stated in [GMPLS-ROUTING],\
    \ depending on the nature of resources\n   that form a particular TE link for\
    \ the purpose of GMPLS signaling, in\n   some cases a combination of <TE link\
    \ identifier, label> is sufficient\n   to unambiguously identify the appropriate\
    \ resource used by an LSP.\n   In other cases, a combination of <TE link identifier,\
    \ label> is not\n   sufficient.  Consider, for example, a TE link between a pair\
    \ of\n   SONET/SDH cross-connects, where this TE link is composed of several\n\
    \   fibers.  In this case the label is a TDM time slot, and moreover,\n   this\
    \ time slot is significant only within a particular fiber.  Thus,\n   when signaling\
    \ an LSP over such a TE link, one needs to specify not\n   just the identity of\
    \ the link, but also the identity of a particular\n   fiber within that TE link,\
    \ as well as a particular label (time slot)\n   within that fiber.  Such cases\
    \ are handled by using the link bundling\n   construct, which is described in\
    \ this document.\n   Consider a TE link such that, for the purpose of GMPLS signaling,\
    \ a\n   combination of <TE link identifier, label> is not sufficient to\n   unambiguously\
    \ identify the appropriate resources used by an LSP.  In\n   this situation, the\
    \ link bundling construct assumes that the set of\n   resources that form the\
    \ TE link could be partitioned into disjoint\n   subsets, such that (a) the partition\
    \ is minimal, and (b) within each\n   subset, a label is sufficient to unambiguously\
    \ identify the\n   appropriate resources used by an LSP.  We refer to such subsets\
    \ as\n   \"component links\", and to the whole TE link as a \"bundled link\".\n\
    \   Furthermore, we restrict the identifiers that can be used to identify\n  \
    \ component links such that they are unique for a given node.  On a\n   bundled\
    \ link, a combination of <component link identifier, label> is\n   sufficient\
    \ to unambiguously identify the appropriate resources used\n   by an LSP.\n  \
    \ The partition of resources that form a bundled link into component\n   links\
    \ has to be done consistently at both ends of the bundled link.\n   Both ends\
    \ of the bundled link also have to understand the other end's\n   component link\
    \ identifiers.\n   The purpose of link bundling is to improve routing scalability\
    \ by\n   reducing the amount of information that has to be handled by OSPF\n \
    \  and/or IS-IS.  This reduction is accomplished by performing\n   information\
    \ aggregation/abstraction.  As with any other information\n   aggregation/abstraction,\
    \ this results in losing some of the\n   information.  To limit the amount of\
    \ losses, one needs to restrict\n   the type of information that can be aggregated/abstracted.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Restrictions on Bundling
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Restrictions on Bundling\n   All component links in a bundle have the same\
    \ Link Type (i.e.,\n   point-to-point or multi-access), the same Traffic Engineering\
    \ metric,\n   the same set of resource classes at each end of the links, and must\n\
    \   begin and end on the same pair of LSRs.\n   A Forwarding Adjacency may be\
    \ a component link; in fact, a bundle can\n   consist of a mix of point-to-point\
    \ links and FAs.\n   If the component links are all multi-access links, the set\
    \ of IS-IS\n   or OSPF routers that are connected to each component link must\
    \ be the\n   same, and the Designated Router for each component link must be the\n\
    \   same.  If these conditions cannot be enforced, multi-access links\n   must\
    \ not be bundled.\n   Component link identifiers MUST be unique across both TE\
    \ and\n   component link identifiers on a particular node.  This means that\n\
    \   unnumbered identifiers have a node-wide scope, and that numbered\n   identifiers\
    \ have the same scope as IP addresses.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Routing Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Routing Considerations\n   A component link may be either numbered or unnumbered.\
    \  A bundled\n   link may itself be numbered or unnumbered, independent of whether\
    \ the\n   component links of that bundled link are numbered.\n   Handling identifiers\
    \ for unnumbered component links, including the\n   case in which a link is formed\
    \ by a Forwarding Adjacency, follows the\n   same rules as those for an unnumbered\
    \ TE link (see Section \"Link\n   Identifiers\" of [RFC3477]/[RFC3480]).  Furthermore,\
    \ link local\n   identifiers for all unnumbered links of a given LSR (whether\n\
    \   component links, Forwarding Adjacencies, or bundled links) MUST be\n   unique\
    \ in the context of that LSR.\n   The \"liveness\" of the bundled link is determined\
    \ by the liveness of\n   each of the component links within the bundled link;\
    \ a bundled link\n   is alive when at least one of its component links is determined\
    \ to be\n   alive.  The liveness of a component link can be determined by any\
    \ of\n   several means: IS-IS or OSPF hellos over the component link, RSVP\n \
    \  Hello, LMP hellos (see [LMP]), or from layer 1 or layer 2\n   indications.\n\
    \   Once a bundled link is determined to be alive, it can be advertised\n   as\
    \ a TE link and the TE information can be flooded.  If IS-IS/OSPF\n   hellos are\
    \ run over the component links, IS-IS/OSPF flooding can be\n   restricted to just\
    \ one of the component links.  Procedures for doing\n   this are outside the scope\
    \ of this document.\n   In the future, as new Traffic Engineering parameters are\
    \ added to\n   IS-IS and OSPF, they should be accompanied by descriptions as to\
    \ how\n   they can be bundled, and possible restrictions on bundling.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Signaling Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Signaling Considerations\n   Because information about the bundled link\
    \ is flooded, but\n   information about the component links is not, typically,\
    \ an LSP's ERO\n   will identify the bundled link to be used for the LSP, but\
    \ not the\n   component link.  While Discovery of component link identities to\
    \ be\n   used in an ERO is outside the scope of the document, it is envisioned\n\
    \   that such information may be provided via configuration or via future\n  \
    \ RRO extensions.  When the bundled link is identified in an ERO or is\n   dynamically\
    \ identified, the choice of the component link for the LSP\n   is a local matter\
    \ between the two LSRs at each end of the bundled\n   link.\n   Signaling must\
    \ identify both the component link and label to use.\n   The choice of the component\
    \ link to use is always made by the sender\n   of the Path/REQUEST message.  If\
    \ an LSP is bidirectional [RFC3471],\n   the sender chooses a component link in\
    \ each direction.  The handling\n   of labels is not modified by this document.\n\
    \   Component link identifiers are carried in RSVP messages, as described\n  \
    \ in section 8 of [RFC3473].  Component link identifiers are carried in\n   CR-LDP\
    \ messages, as described in section 8 of [RFC3473].  Additional\n   processing\
    \ related to unnumbered links is described in the\n   \"Processing the IF_ID RSVP_HOP\
    \ object\"/\"Processing the IF_ID TLV\",\n   and \"Unnumbered Forwarding Adjacencies\"\
    \ sections of\n   [RFC3477]/[RFC3480].\n   [RFC3471] defines the Interface Identification\
    \ type-length-value\n   (TLV) types.  This document specifies that the TLV types\
    \ 1, 2, and 3\n   SHOULD be used to indicate component links in IF_ID RSVP_HOP\
    \ objects\n   and IF_ID TLVs.\n   Type 1 TLVs are used for IPv4 numbered component\
    \ link identifiers.\n   Type 2 TLVs are used for IPv6 numbered component link\
    \ identifiers.\n   Type 3 TLVs are used for unnumbered component link identifiers.\n\
    \   The Component Interface TLVs, TLV types 4 and 5, SHOULD NOT be used.\n   Note,\
    \ in Path and REQUEST messages, link identifiers MUST be\n   specified from the\
    \ sender's perspective.\n   Except in the special case noted below, for a unidirectional\
    \ LSP,\n   only a single TLV SHOULD be used in an IF_ID RSVP_HOP object or IF_ID\n\
    \   TLV.  This TLV indicates the component link identifier of the\n   downstream\
    \ data channel on which label allocation must be done.\n   Except in the special\
    \ case noted below, for a bidirectional LSP, only\n   one or two TLVs SHOULD be\
    \ used in an IF_ID RSVP_HOP object or IF_ID\n   TLV.  The first TLV always indicates\
    \ the component link identifier of\n   the downstream data channel on which label\
    \ allocation must be done.\n   When present, the second TLV always indicates the\
    \ component link\n   identifier of the upstream data channel on which label allocation\n\
    \   must be done.  When only one TLV is present, it indicates the\n   component\
    \ link identifier for both downstream and upstream data\n   channels.\n   In the\
    \ special case where the same label is to be valid across all\n   component links,\
    \ two TLVs SHOULD be used in an IF_ID RSVP_HOP object\n   or IF_ID TLV.  The first\
    \ TLV indicates the TE link identifier of the\n   bundle on which label allocation\
    \ must be done.  The second TLV\n   indicates a bundle scope label.  For TLV types\
    \ 1 and 2, this is done\n   by using the special bit value of all ones (1) (e.g.,\
    \ 0xFFFFFFFF for\n   a type 1 TLV).  Per [RFC3471], for TLV types 3, 4, and 5,\
    \ this is\n   done by setting the Interface ID field to the special value\n  \
    \ 0xFFFFFFFF.  Note that this special case applies to both\n   unidirectional\
    \ and bidirectional LSPs.\n   Although it SHOULD NOT be used, when used, the type\
    \ 5 TLV MUST NOT be\n   the first TLV in an IF_ID RSVP_HOP object or IF_ID TLV.\n"
- title: 2.3.1.  Interface Identification TLV Format
  contents:
  - "2.3.1.  Interface Identification TLV Format\n   This section modifies section\
    \ 9.1.1. of [RFC3471].  The definition of\n   the IP Address field of the TLV\
    \ types 3, 4, and 5 is clarified.\n      For types 3, 4, and 5, the Value field\
    \ has an identical format to\n      the contents of the C-Type 1 LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID\
    \ object\n      defined in [RFC3477].  Note that this results in the renaming\
    \ of\n      the IP Address field defined in [RFC3471].\n"
- title: 2.3.2.  Errored Component Identification
  contents:
  - "2.3.2.  Errored Component Identification\n   When Interface Identification TLVs\
    \ are used, the TLVs are also used\n   to indicate the specific components associated\
    \ with an error.  For\n   RSVP, this means that any received TLVs SHOULD be copied\
    \ into the\n   IF_ID ERROR_SPEC object (see Section 8.2 in [RFC3473]).  The Error\n\
    \   Node Address field of the object SHOULD indicate the TE Link\n   associated\
    \ with the error.  For CR-LDP, this means that any received\n   TLVs SHOULD be\
    \ copied into the IF_ID Status TLV (see Section 8.2 in\n   [RFC3472]).  The HOP\
    \ Address field of the TLV SHOULD indicate the TE\n   Link associated with the\
    \ error.\n"

    \ link.  The definition of these\n   parameters for component links was undertaken\

  contents:
  - "3.2.  OSPF Link ID\n   For point-to-point links, the Link ID of a bundled link\

- title: 4.  Bandwidth Accounting
  contents:
  - "4.  Bandwidth Accounting\n   The RSVP (or CR-LDP) Traffic Control module, or\
    \ its equivalent, on an\n   LSR with bundled links must apply admission control\
    \ on a per-\n   component link basis.  An LSP with a bandwidth requirement b and\n\
    \   setup priority p fits in a bundled link if at least one component\n   link\
    \ has a maximum LSP bandwidth >= b at priority p.  If there are\n   several such\
    \ links, the implementation will choose which link to use\n   for the LSP.\n \
    \  In order to know the maximum LSP bandwidth (per priority) of each\n   component\
    \ link, the Traffic Control module must track the unreserved\n   bandwidth (per\
    \ priority) for each component link.\n   A change in the unreserved bandwidth\
    \ of a component link results in a\n   change in the unreserved bandwidth of the\
    \ bundled link.  It also\n   potentially results in a change in the maximum LSP\
    \ bandwidth of the\n   bundle; thus, the maximum LSP bandwidth should be recomputed.\n\
    \   If one of the component links goes down, the associated bundled link\n   remains\
    \ up and continues to be advertised, provided that at least one\n   component\
    \ link associated with the bundled link is up.  The\n   unreserved bandwidth of\
    \ the component link that is down is set to\n   zero, and the unreserved bandwidth\
    \ and maximum LSP bandwidth of the\n   bundle must be recomputed.  If all the\
    \ component links associated\n   with a given bundled link are down, the bundled\
    \ link MUST not be\n   advertised into OSPF/IS-IS.\n"
