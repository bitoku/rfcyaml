    \   Over the past few years the Internet has undergone significant\n   changes.\
    \  Among them is the emergence of multiple Network Service\n   Providers, where\
    \ resources that provide Internet-wide IP connectivity\n   (routers, links) are\
    \ controlled by different organizations.  This\n   document presents some of the\
    \ issues related to network layer routing\n   in a multi-provider Internet, and\
    \ specifically to the unicast\n   routing.\n"
- title: 1. Network Service Providers vs Network Service Subscribers
  contents:
  - "1. Network Service Providers vs Network Service Subscribers\n   Within the current\
    \ routing paradigm the service offered by a provider\n   at the network layer\
    \ (IP) is the set of destinations (hosts) that can\n   be reached through the\
    \ provider. Once a subscriber establishes direct\n   connectivity to a provider,\
    \ the subscriber can in principle reach all\n   the destinations reachable through\
    \ the provider. Since the value of\n   the Internet-wide connectivity service\
    \ offered by a provider\n   increases with the number of destinations reachable\
    \ through the\n   provider, providers are motivated to interconnect with each\
    \ other.\n   In principle a provider need not offer the same service (in terms\
    \ of\n   the set of destinations) to all of its subscribers -- for some of the\n\
    \   subscribers the provider may restrict the services to a subset of the\n  \
    \ destinations reachable through the provider. In fact, for certain\n   types\
    \ of subscribers constrained connectivity could be seen as part\n   of the service\
    \ offered by a provider.\n   In a multi-provider environment individual providers\
    \ may be driven by\n   diverse and sometimes even conflicting goals and objectives.\
    \ Some of\n   the providers exist to provide connectivity to only a specific group\n\
    \   of Network Service Subscribers. Other providers place no constraints\n   on\
    \ the subscribers that can subscribe to them, as long as the\n   subscribers pay\
    \ the fee charged by the providers. Some of the\n   providers place certain constraints\
    \ on the reselling of the\n   connectivity services by organizations (e.g., other\
    \ providers)\n   attached to the providers. Some of the providers may be operated\
    \ by\n   companies that are subject to specific regulations (e.g.,  regulated\n\
    \   monopoly), while other providers are completely unregulated.  The\n   scope\
    \ of geographical coverage among providers varies from a small\n   region (e.g.,\
    \ county, town) to a country-wide, international, or even\n   intercontinental.\n\
    \   There is no centralized control over all the providers in the\n   Internet.\
    \  The providers do not always coordinate their efforts with\n   each other, and\
    \ quite often are in competition with each other.\n   Despite all the diversity\
    \ among the providers, the Internet-wide IP\n   connectivity is realized via Internet-wide\
    \ distributed routing, which\n   involves multiple providers, and thus implies\
    \ certain degree of\n   cooperation and coordination. Therefore, there is a need\
    \ to balance\n   the providers' goals and objectives against the public interest\
    \ of\n   Internet-wide connectivity and subscribers' choices. Further work is\n\
    \   needed to understand how to reach the balance.\n"
- title: 2. Routing Requirements
  contents:
  - "2. Routing Requirements\n   Conceptually routing requirements can be classified\
    \ into the\n   following three categories: source preferences, destination\n \
    \  preferences, and constraints on transit traffic. Source preferences\n   allow\
    \ an originator of a packet to exert control over the path to a\n   destination.\
    \  Destination preferences allow a destination to exert\n   control over the path\
    \ from a source to the destination. Constraints\n   on transit traffic allow a\
    \ provider to control the traffic that can\n   traverse through the resources\
    \ (routers, links) controlled by the\n   provider.\n   From a conceptual point\
    \ of view the requirements over the degree of\n   control for source and destination\
    \ preferences may vary from being\n   able to just provide connectivity (regardless\
    \ of the path), to being\n   able to select immediate providers, to more complex\
    \ scenarios, where\n   at the other extreme a subscriber may want to have complete\
    \ control\n   over the path selection.\n   From a conceptual point of view the\
    \ requirements over the degree of\n   control for transit traffic may vary from\
    \ control based only on the\n   direct physical connectivity (controlling the\
    \ set of organizations\n   directly connected to the provider), to being able\
    \ to restrict\n   traffic to a particular set of sources or destinations, or a\n\
    \   combination of particular sources and destinations, or even take into\n  \
    \ account the paths to/from these sources and/or destinations.\n   In view of\
    \ a potentially wide variety of routing requirements, we\n   need to get a better\
    \ understanding on the relative practical\n   importance of various routing requirements.\
    \ In practice organizations\n   usually don't formulate their routing requirements\
    \ in a vacuum. For\n   example, since the primary role of a provider is to provide\
    \ services\n   to a set of subscribers, the provider usually formulates its routing\n\
    \   requirements based on the set of the routing requirements of the\n   subscribers\
    \ the provider is expected to serve.\n   Support for various routing requirements\
    \ should take into account the\n   overhead and the scope of the overhead associated\
    \ with those\n   requirements. A situation where an organization can unilaterally\n\
    \   impose routing information overhead on other organization (e.g., by\n   requiring\
    \ the other organization to maintain an additional routing\n   information) should\
    \ be viewed as undesirable. The cost of supporting\n   a particular routing requirement\
    \ should not be borne by organizations\n   that do not benefit from supporting\
    \ that requirement. Ideally the\n   routing system should allow to shift the overhead\
    \ associated with a\n   particular routing requirement towards the entity that\
    \ instigates the\n   requirement (for example, there is a need to carefully balance\
    \ the\n   overhead associated with maintaining a state needed for multi-hop\n\
    \   header compression vs carrying explicit forwarding information on a\n   per\
    \ packet basis).  Organizations with simple routing requirements\n   shouldn't\
    \ bear the same routing information overhead as organizations\n   with complex\
    \ routing requirements.\n   A situation where the overhead associated with supporting\
    \ a\n   particular routing requirement has to be carried by every entity\n   (e.g.,\
    \ router, host) within an organization that would like to impose\n   the requirement\
    \ could be viewed as undesirable. An organization\n   should be able to instantiate\
    \ its routing requirements in a more or\n   less central fashion, for example\
    \ by utilizing just some of the\n   routers.\n   Even if the scope of the routing\
    \ information overhead is purely\n   local, there is a need to perform a careful\
    \ analysis of the tradeoff\n   between the potential benefits and the cost associated\
    \ with\n   supporting various routing requirements.\n"
- title: 3. Encapsulation
  contents:
  - "3. Encapsulation\n   The technique of encapsulation allows for the creation of\
    \ a \"virtual\"\n   IP overlay over an existing IP infrastructure. This has certain\n\
    \   implications for the Internet routing system.\n   In the presence of encapsulation,\
    \ a provider may no longer be able to\n   constrain its transit traffic to a particular\
    \ set of ultimate sources\n   and/or destinations, as a packet may be encapsulated\
    \ by some router\n   along the path, with the original source and/or destination\
    \ addresses\n   being \"hidden\" (via encapsulation) at the Network layer. Likewise,\n\
    \   encapsulation may affect source and destination preferences, as a\n   source\
    \ (or a destination) may either (a) be unaware of the\n   encapsulation, or (b)\
    \ have little or no control over the encapsulated\n   segment of a path.\n   Further\
    \ work is needed to understand the implications of the overlay\n   capabilities\
    \ created via encapsulation on the semantics of routing\n   requirements, as well\
    \ as the interaction among the routing\n   requirements by the entities that form\
    \ the overlay and the entities\n   that form the underlying infrastructure.\n"
- title: 4. Price Structure and its Impact on Routing
  contents:
  - "4. Price Structure and its Impact on Routing\n   Routing among providers, as\
    \ well as between providers and subscribers\n   may be influenced by the price\
    \ structure employed by the providers,\n   as well as the usage pattern of the\
    \ subscribers. A provider can view\n   routing as a mechanism that allows the\
    \ provider to exert control over\n   who can use the provider's services. A subscriber\
    \ can view routing as\n   a mechanism that allows the subscriber to exert control\
    \ over the\n   price it pays for the Internet connectivity.\n   The need to exert\
    \ control has to be carefully balanced against the\n   cost of the routing mechanisms\
    \ needed to provide such control. In a\n   competitive market one could question\
    \ the viability of a mechanism\n   whose incremental cost would be greater than\
    \ the saving recovered by\n   the mechanism -- competitive pressure or alternate\
    \ mechanisms are\n   likely to push providers and subscribers towards choosing\
    \ the\n   cheapest mechanism.\n"
- title: 5. Scalability
  contents:
  - "5. Scalability\n   One of the key requirements imposed on the Internet routing\
    \ is its\n   ability to scale. In addition to conventional metrics for scalability\n\
    \   (e.g., memory, CPU, bandwidth), we need to take into account\n   scalability\
    \ with respect to the human resources required to operate\n   the system. The\
    \ need for deployment of CIDR already showed that a\n   routing scheme that scales\
    \ linearly with respect to the number of\n   connected networks, or even to the\
    \ number of connected organizations\n   is unacceptable today, and is likely to\
    \ be unacceptable in the long\n   term. It is not clear whether routing that scales\
    \ linearly with the\n   number of providers is going to be acceptable in the long\
    \ term.\n   Scaling implies that the Internet routing system needs to have\n \
    \  powerful mechanisms to provide routing information\n   aggregation/abstraction.\n\
    \   In the absence of Internet-wide coordination and in the presence of\n   competition\
    \ among the providers, the aggregation/abstraction\n   mechanisms should minimize\
    \ preconditions as well as limit the amount\n   of required inter-provider coordination.\
    \ Ideally the routing system\n   should allow a provider to control the amount\
    \ of its local resources\n   needed to deal with the routing overhead based on\
    \ considerations that\n   are purely local to the provider.\n   One of the side\
    \ effects of the routing information\n   aggregation/abstraction is that some\
    \ of the routing information is\n   going to be lost. This may impact route optimality\
    \ and even the\n   ability to find an existing route. The need for routing information\n\
    \   aggregation/abstraction also implies certain homogeneity of the\n   information\
    \ to be aggregated/abstracted. This needs to be counter-\n   balanced against\
    \ the potential diversity of routing requirements.\n   As a way to deal with the\
    \ routing information loss due to\n   aggregation/abstraction, we need to explore\
    \ mechanisms that allow\n   routing that is based on the on-demand acquisition\
    \ of subsets of\n   unaggregated information.\n   The overhead associated with\
    \ supporting specific routing requirements\n   has a direct impact on the overall\
    \ scalability of the Internet\n   routing system. We need to get a better understanding\
    \ of how various\n   routing requirements impact scalability. When the impact\
    \ is\n   significant, and the requirements have practical importance we need\n\
    \   to develop mechanisms that allow the impact to be reduced.\n"
- title: 6. Hierarchical Routing
  contents:
  - "6. Hierarchical Routing\n   Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) (RFC1518, RFC1519)\
    \ that is used\n   today for scalable Internet-wide routing is based on the technique\
    \ of\n   hierarchical routing. Essential to this technique is the assumption\n\
    \   that Network layer addresses assigned to individual entities (e.g.,\n   hosts,\
    \ routers) reflect the position of these entities within the\n   network topology\
    \ -- addresses are said to be \"topologically\n   significant\". With CIDR addresses\
    \ assigned to most of the individual\n   sites are expected to reflect providers\
    \ the sites are connected to --\n   CIDR uses \"provider-based\" addresses.\n\
    \   One of the fundamental consequences of using hierarchical routing is\n   that\
    \ in order to preserve topological significance of network\n   addresses, changes\
    \ in the network topology may need to be accompanied\n   by the corresponding\
    \ changes in the addresses. Presence of multiple\n   providers serving the same\
    \ geographical area implies that a\n   subscriber should be able to switch from\
    \ one provider to another.\n   Since such a switch implies changes in the Internet\
    \ topology, it\n   follows that to retain topological significance of the (provider-\n\
    \   based) addresses within the subscriber, the subscriber has to change\n   the\
    \ addresses of all of its entities -- the process known as\n   \"renumbering\"\
    . There are already tools to facilitate this process --\n   Dynamic Host Configuration\
    \ Protocol (DHCP).  However, DHCP is not yet\n   widely deployed. Further work\
    \ is needed to improve these tools, get\n   them widely deployed, and to integrate\
    \ them with Domain Name System\n   (DNS).\n   Multi-level hierarchical routing\
    \ allows for recapturing additional\n   routing information (routing entropy)\
    \ due to the mismatch between\n   addresses and topology at a particular level\
    \ in the routing hierarchy\n   at some higher level in the hierarchy (e.g., at\
    \ an exchange point\n   among providers).  This enables the routing system to\
    \ contain the\n   scope of entities impacted by the mismatch. Containing the scope\
    \ of\n   entities could be an important factor to facilitate graceful\n   renumbering.\
    \  Further work is needed to develop appropriate\n   deployment strategies to\
    \ put these capabilities in place.\n   It is important to emphasize that the requirement\
    \ to maintain\n   topologically significant addresses doesn't need to be applied\n\
    \   indiscriminately to all the organizations connected to the Internet\n   --\
    \ hierarchical routing requires that most, but not all addresses be\n   topologically\
    \ significant.  For a large organization it could be\n   sufficient if the set\
    \ of destinations within the organization can be\n   represented within the Internet\
    \ routing system as a small number of\n   address prefixes, even if these address\
    \ prefixes are independent of\n   the providers that the organization uses to\
    \ connect to the Internet\n   (\"provider-independent\" addresses). The volume\
    \ of routing information\n   that a large organization would inject into the Internet\
    \ routing\n   system would be comparable to the (aggregated) routing information\n\
    \   associated with a large number of small organizations.\n   Existence of multiple\
    \ providers allows a subscriber to be\n   simultaneously connected to more than\
    \ one provider (multi-homed\n   subscribers). CIDR offers several alternatives\
    \ for handling such\n   cases. We need to gain more operational experience as\
    \ well as better\n   understand tradeoffs associated with the proposed alternatives.\n\
    \   An alternative to CIDR address assignment is to assign addresses\n   based\
    \ purely on the geographical location. However, address\n   assignment that reflects\
    \ geographical location of an entity implies\n   that either (a) the Internet\
    \ topology needs to be made sufficiently\n   congruent to the geography, or (b)\
    \ addresses aren't going to be\n   topologically significant. In the former case\
    \ we need to understand\n   the driving forces that would make the topology congruent\
    \ to the\n   geography. In the latter case techniques other than hierarchical\n\
    \   routing need to be developed.\n"
- title: 7. Routing Information Sharing
  contents:
  - "7. Routing Information Sharing\n   While ensuring Internet-wide coordination\
    \ may be more and more\n   difficult, as the Internet continues to grow, stability\
    \ and\n   consistency of the Internet-wide routing could significantly benefit\n\
    \   if the information about routing requirements of various\n   organizations\
    \ could be shared across organizational boundaries. Such\n   information could\
    \ be used in a wide variety of situations ranging\n   from troubleshooting to\
    \ detecting and eliminating conflicting routing\n   requirements. The scale of\
    \ the Internet implies that the information\n   should be distributed. Work is\
    \ currently underway to establish\n   depositories of this information (Routing\
    \ Registries), as well as to\n   develop tools that analyze, as well as utilize\
    \ this information.\n"

    \ in a\n   multi-provider Internet. There are no doubt routing-related areas\n\
    \   that are not covered in this document. For instance, such areas as\n   multicast\
    \ routing, or routing in the presence of mobile hosts, or\n   routing in the presence\
    \ of a large shared media (e.g., ATM) aren't\n   discussed here. Further work\
    \ is needed to understand the implications\n   of a multi-provider Internet on\
    \ these areas.\n   The impact of multi-provider Internet goes well beyond just\
    \ routing,\n   and percolates into such areas as network management,\n   troubleshooting,\
    \ and others. Further work is needed to assess the\n   implications of multi-provider\
