  - "1. INTRODUCTION\n   1.1 The Internet Domain Name System\n   The Domain Name System\
    \ (DNS) provides for the translation between\n   hostnames and addresses.  Within\
    \ the Internet, this means translating\n   from a name such as \"venera.isi.edu\"\
    , to an IP address such as\n   \"128.9.0.32\".  The DNS is a set of protocols\
    \ and databases.  The\n   protocols define the syntax and semantics for a query\
    \ language to ask\n   questions about information located by DNS-style names.\
    \  The\n   databases are distributed and replicated.  There is no dependence on\n\
    \   a single central server, and each part of the database is provided in\n  \
    \ at least two servers.\n   The assignment of the 32-bit IP addresses is a separate\
    \ activity.  IP\n   addresses are delegated by the central Internet Registry to\
    \ regional\n   authorities (such as the RIPE NCC for Europe) and the network\n\
    \   providers.\n   To have a network number assigned please contact your network\
    \ service\n   provider or regional registration authority.  To determine who this\n\
    \   is (or as a last resort), you can contact the central Internet\n   Registry\
    \ at Hostmaster@INTERNIC.NET.\n   In addition to translating names to addresses\
    \ for hosts that are on\n   the Internet, the DNS provides for registering DNS-style\
    \ names for\n   other hosts reachable (via electronic mail) through gateways or\
    \ mail\n   relays.  The records for such name registrations point to an Internet\n\
    \   host (one with an IP address) that acts as a mail forwarder for the\n   registered\
    \ host.  For example, the host \"bah.rochester.ny.us\" is\n   registered in the\
    \ DNS with a pointer to the mail relay\n   \"relay1.uu.net\".  This type of pointer\
    \ is called an MX record.\n   This gives electronic mail users a uniform mail\
    \ addressing syntax and\n   avoids making users aware of the underlying network\
    \ boundaries.\n   The reason for the development of the domain system was growth\
    \ in the\n   Internet.  The hostname to address mappings were maintained by the\n\
    \   InterNIC in a single file, called HOSTS.TXT, which was FTP'd by all\n   the\
    \ hosts on the Internet.  The network population was changing in\n   character.\
    \  The time-share hosts that made up the original ARPANET\n   were being replaced\
    \ with local networks of workstations.  Local\n   organizations were administering\
    \ their own names and addresses, but\n   had to wait for the NIC to make changes\
    \ in HOSTS.TXT to make the\n   changes visible to the Internet at large.  Organizations\
    \ also wanted\n   some local structure on the name space.  The applications on\
    \ the\n   Internet were getting more sophisticated and creating a need for\n \
    \  general purpose name service.  The idea of a hierarchical name space,\n   with\
    \ the hierarchy roughly corresponding to organizational structure,\n   and names\
    \ using \".\" as the character to mark the boundary between\n   hierarchy levels\
    \ was developed.  A design using a distributed\n   database and generalized resources\
    \ was implemented.\n   The DNS provides standard formats for resource data, standard\
    \ methods\n   for querying the database, and standard methods for name servers\
    \ to\n   refresh local data from other name servers.\n   1.2  Top-Level Domains\n\
    \   The top-level domains in the DNS are EDU, COM, GOV, MIL, ORG, INT,\n   and\
    \ NET, and all the 2-letter country codes from the list of\n   countries in ISO-3166.\
    \  The establishment of new top-level domains is\n   managed by the Internet Assigned\
    \ Numbers Authority (IANA).  The IANA\n   may be contacted at IANA@ISI.EDU.\n\
    \   Even though the original intention was that any educational\n   institution\
    \ anywhere in the world could be registered under the EDU\n   domain, in practice,\
    \ it has turned out with few exceptions, only\n   those in the United States have\
    \ registered under EDU, similarly with\n   COM (for commercial). In other countries,\
    \ everything is registered\n   under the 2-letter country code, often with some\
    \ subdivision.  For\n   example, in Korea (KR) the second level names are AC for\
    \ academic\n   community, CO for commercial, GO for government, and RE for research.\n\
    \   However, each country may go its own way about organizing its domain,\n  \
    \ and many have.\n   There are no current plans of putting all of the organizational\n\
    \   domains EDU, GOV, COM, etc., under US.  These name tokens are not\n   used\
    \ in the US Domain to avoid confusion.\n   Currently, only four year colleges\
    \ and universities are being\n   registered in the EDU domain.  All other schools\
    \ are being registered\n   in the US Domain.\n   There are also concerns about\
    \ the size of the other top-level domains\n   (especially COM) and ideas are being\
    \ considered for restructuring.\n   Other names sometimes appear as top-level\
    \ domain names.  Some people\n   have made up names in the DNS-style without coordinating\
    \ or\n   registering  with the DNS management.  Some names that typically\n  \
    \ appear are BITNET, UUCP, and two-letter codes for continents, such as\n   \"\
    NA\" for North America (this conflicts with the official Internet\n   code for\
    \ Namibia).\n   For example, the DNS-style name \"KA7EEJ.CO.USA.NA\" is used in\
    \ the\n   amateur radio network.  These addresses are never supposed to show up\n\
    \   on the Internet but they do occasionally.  The amateur radio network\n   people\
    \ created their own naming scheme, and it interferes sometimes\n   with Internet\
    \ addresses.\n   1.3  The US Domain\n   The US Domain is an official top-level\
    \ domain in the DNS of the\n   Internet community.  The domain administrators\
    \ are Jon Postel and Ann\n   Westine Cooper at the Information Sciences Institute\
    \ of the\n   University of Southern California (USC-ISI).\n   US is the ISO-3166\
    \ 2-letter country code for the United States and\n   thus the US Domain is established\
    \ as a top-level domain and\n   registered with the InterNIC the same way other\
    \ country domains are.\n   Because organizations in the United States have registered\
    \ primarily\n   in the EDU and COM domains, little use was initially made of the\
    \ US\n   domain.  In the past, the computers registered in the US Domain were\n\
    \   primarily owned by small companies or individuals with computers at\n   home.\
    \  However, the US Domain has grown and currently registers hosts\n   in federal\
    \ government agencies, state government agencies, K12\n   schools, community colleges,\
    \ technical/vocational schools, private\n   schools, libraries, city and county\
    \ government agencies, to name a\n   few.\n   Initially, the administration of\
    \ the US Domain was managed solely by\n   the Domain Registrar.  However, due\
    \ to the increase in registrations,\n   administration of subdomains is being\
    \ delegated to others.\n   Any computer in the United States may be registered\
    \ in the US Domain.\n"
- title: 2. NAMING STRUCTURE
  contents:
  - "2. NAMING STRUCTURE\n   The US Domain hierarchy is based on political geography.\
    \  The basic\n   name space under US is the state name space, then the \"locality\"\
    \ name\n   space, (like a city, or county) then organization or computer name\n\
    \   and so on.\n   For example:\n          BERKELEY.CA.US\n          PORTLAND.WA.US\n\
    \   There is of course no problem with running out of names.\n   The things that\
    \ are named are individual computers.\n   If you register now in one city and\
    \ then move, the database can be\n   updated with a new name in your new city,\
    \ and a pointer can be set up\n   from your old name to your new name.  This type\
    \ of pointer is called\n   a CNAME record.\n   The use of unregistered names is\
    \ not effective and causes problems\n   for other users.  Inventing your own name\
    \ and using it without\n   registering is not a good idea.\n   In addition to\
    \ strictly geographically names, some special names are\n   used, such as FED,\
    \ STATE, AGENCY, DISTRICT, K12, LIB, CC, CITY, and\n   COUNTY.  Several new name\
    \ spaces have been created, DNI, GEN, and\n   TEC, and a minor change under the\
    \ \"locality\" name space was made to\n   the existing CITY and COUNTY subdomains\
    \ by abbreviating them to CI\n   and CO.  A detailed description follows.\n  \
    \ Below US, Parallel to States:\n   -----------------------------\n   \"FED\"\
    \ - This branch may be used for agencies of the federal\n   government.  For example:\
    \ <org-name>.<city>.FED.US\n   \"DNI\" - DISTRIBUTED NATIONAL INSTITUTES - The\
    \ \"DNI\" branch was\n   created directly under the top-level US.  This branch\
    \ is to be used\n   for distributed national institutes; organizations that span\
    \ state,\n   regional, and other organizational boundaries; that are national\
    \ in\n   scope, and have distributed facilities.  For example:\n   <org-name>.DNI.US.\n\
    \   Name Space Within States:\n   ------------------------\n   \"locality\" -\
    \ cities, counties, parishes, and townships.  Subdomains\n   under the \"locality\"\
    \ would be like CI.<city>.<state>.US,\n   CO.<county>.<state>.US, or businesses.\
    \ For example:\n   Petville.Marvista.CA.US.\n   \"CI\" - This branch is used for\
    \ city government agencies and is a\n   subdomain under the \"locality\" name\
    \ (like Los Angeles). For example:\n   Fire-Dept.CI.Los-Angeles.CA.US.\n   \"\
    CO\" - This branch is used for county government agencies and is a\n   subdomain\
    \ under the \"locality\" name (like Los Angeles).  For example:\n   Fire-Dept.CO.San-Diego.CA.US.\n\
    \   \"K12\" - This branch may be used for public school districts.  A\n   special\
    \ name \"PVT\" can be used in the place of a school district name\n   for private\
    \ schools.  For example: <school-name>.K12.<state>.US and\n   <school-name>.PVT.K12.<state>.US.\n\
    \   \"CC\" - COMMUNITY COLLEGES - This branch was established for all state\n\
    \   wide community colleges.  For example: <school-name>.CC.<state>.US.\n   \"\
    TEC\" - TECHNICAL AND VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS - The branch \"TEC\" was\n   established\
    \ for technical and vocational schools and colleges. For\n   example: <school-name>.TEC.<state>.US.\n\
    \   \"LIB\" - LIBRARIES (STATE, REGIONAL, CITY, COUNTY) - This branch may\n  \
    \ be used for libraries only.  For example:  <lib-name>.LIB.<state>.US.\n   \"\
    STATE\" - This branch may be used for state government agencies.  For\n   example:\
    \  <org-name>.STATE.<state>.US.\n   \"GEN\" - GENERAL INDEPENDENT ENTITY - This\
    \ branch is for the things\n   that don't fit easily into any other structure\
    \ listed -- things that\n   might fit in to something like ORG at the top-level.\
    \  It is best not\n   to use the same keywords (ORG, EDU, COM, etc.) that are\
    \ used at the\n   top-level to avoid confusion.  GEN would be used for such things\
    \ as,\n   state-wide organizations, clubs, or domain parks.  For example:\n  \
    \ <org-name>.GEN.<state-code>.US.\n   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\

    \   2.1  State Codes\n   The state codes are the two letter US Postal abbreviations.\
    \ For\n   example: \"CA\" California.\n   2.2  Locality Names\n   Within the state\
    \ name space there are \"locality\" names, some may be\n   cities, some may be\
    \ counties, some may be local names, but not\n   incorporated entities.\n   Registered\
    \ names under \"locality\" could be like:\n     <hostname>.CI.<locality>.<state>.US\
    \   ==>  city gov't agency\n     <hostname>.CO.<locality>.<state>.US,  ==>  county\
    \ gov't agency\n     <hostname>.<locality>.<state>.US      ==>  businesses\n \
    \  In the cases where the locality name is a county, there is a branch\n   under\
    \ the locality name, called \"county\" or \"CO\", that is used by the\n   county\
    \ government.  Businesses are registered directly under the\n   locality name.\n\
    \   Under the city locality name space there is a \"city\" or \"CI\" branch\n\
    \   for city government agencies.  As usual, businesses and private\n   schools\
    \ may register directly under the city name.\n   In the case where there is both\
    \ a county and a city with the same\n   locality name there is no problem, since\
    \ the names will be unique\n   with the \"CO\" or \"CI\" keyword.  In our area\
    \ the county has a fire\n   department and the city has its own fire department.\
    \  They could have\n   names like:\n      Fire-Dept.CI.Los-Angeles.CA.US\n   \
    \   Fire-Dept.CO.Los-Angeles.CA.US\n   Cities may be named (designated) by their\
    \ full name (spelled out with\n   hyphens replacing spaces (e.g., Los-Angeles\
    \ or Fort-Collins), or by a\n   city code.  The first choice is the full city\
    \ name.  In some cases it\n   may be appropriate to use the well-known city abbreviation\
    \ known\n   throughout a locality.  However, it is very desirable that all users\n\
    \   in the same city use the same designator for the city.  That is, any\n   particular\
    \ locality should have just one DNS name.\n   Some users would like names associated\
    \ with a greater metropolitan\n   area or region like the \"Bay Area\" or \"Tri-Cities\"\
    .  One problem with\n   this is that these names are not necessarily unique within\
    \ a state.\n   The best thing to do in this case is to use the larger metropolitan\n\
    \   city in your hostname.  Cities and counties are used.\n   Should all the names\
    \ be obvious?  Trying to do this is desirable and\n   also impossible.  There\
    \ will come a point when the obviously right\n   name for an organization is already\
    \ taken.  As the system grows this\n   will happen with increasing frequency.\
    \  While ease of use to the end\n   user is desirable, a higher priority must\
    \ be placed on having a\n   system that operates.  This means that the manageability\
    \ of the\n   system must have high consideration.\n   The reason the DNS was created\
    \ was to subdivide the problem of\n   maintaining a list of hosts in the Internet\
    \ into manageable portions.\n   The happy result is that this subdivision makes\
    \ name uniqueness\n   easier and promotes logical grouping.  What is a \"logical\
    \ grouping\"\n   though, always depends on the viewer.\n   Many levels of delegation\
    \ are needed to keep the zone files\n   manageable.  Many sections of the name\
    \ space are needed to allow\n   unique names to be easily added.\n   Way back\
    \ in the olden days, when the Internet was invented, some\n   thought that an\
    \ 8-bit network number would be more than enough to\n   number all the networks\
    \ that would ever exist.  Today, there are over\n   10,000 networks operating\
    \ in the Internet, and arguments are made\n   about the doubling time being 2\
    \ years versus 4 years.\n   One concern is that things will continue to grow dramatically,\
    \ and\n   this will require more subdivision of the domain name management.\n\
    \   Maybe the plan for the US Domain is overkill on growth planning, but\n   there\
    \ has never been overplanning for growth yet.\n   When things are bigger, names\
    \ have to be longer.  There is an\n   argument that with only 8-character names,\
    \ and in each position allow\n   a-z, 0-9, and -, you get 37**8 = 3,512,479,453,921\
    \ or 3.5 trillion\n   possible names.  It is a great argument, but how many of\
    \ us want\n   names like \"xs4gp-7q\".  It is like license plate numbers, sure\
    \ some\n   people get the name they want on a vanity plate, but a lot more\n \
    \  people who want something specific on a vanity plate can't get it\n   because\
    \ someone else got it first.  Structure and longer names also\n   let more people\
    \ get their \"obviously right\" name.\n   2.3  Schools\n   K12 schools are connecting\
    \ to the Internet and registering in the\n   Internet DNS.  A decision has been\
    \ made by the IANA (after\n   consultation with the new InterNIC Internet Registry\
    \ and the Federal\n   Networking Council (FNC)) to direct these school registrations\
    \ to the\n   US domain using the naming structure described here.\n   There is\
    \ a need for competent, experienced, volunteers to come\n   forward to act as\
    \ third and perhaps fourth level registries and to\n   operate delegated portions\
    \ of the DNS.\n   There are two reasons for registering schools in the US Domain.\
    \  (1)\n   uniqueness of names, and (2) management of the database.\n     1. Name\
    \ Uniqueness:\n        There are many \"Washington\" high schools, only one can\
    \ be\n        \"Washington.EDU\" (actually none can be, since that name is used\n\
    \        by a University.  There will be many name conflicts if all\n        schools\
    \ attempt to register directly under EDU.\n        In addition, in some districts,\
    \ the same school name is used at\n        different levels, for example, Washington\
    \ Elementary School and\n        Washington High School.  We suggest that when\
    \ necessary, the\n        keywords \"Elementary\", \"Middle\", and \"High\" be\
    \ used to\n        distinguish these schools.  These keywords would only be used\n\
    \        when they are needed, if the school's name is unique without\n      \
    \  such keywords, don't use them.\n     2. Database Management:\n        One goal\
    \ of the DNS is to divide up the management of the name\n        database in to\
    \ small pieces.  Each piece (or \"zone\" in DNS\n        terminology) could be\
    \ managed by a distinct administrator.\n        Adding all the high schools to\
    \ the EDU domain will make the\n        already large zone file for EDU even larger,\
    \ possibly to the\n        point of being unmanageable.\n   For both these reasons\
    \ it is necessary to introduce structure into\n   names.  Structure provides a\
    \ basis for making common names unique in\n   context, and for dividing the management\
    \ responsibility.\n      The US Domain has a framework established and has registered\
    \ many\n      schools already in this structured scheme.  The general form is:\n\
    \         <school>.<district>.K12.<state>.US.\n            For example: Hamilton.LA-Unified.K12.CA.US\n\
    \   Public schools are usually organized by districts which can be larger\n  \
    \ or smaller than a city or county.  For example, the Portland school\n   district\
    \ in Oregon, is in three or four counties.  Each of those\n   counties also has\
    \ non-Portland districts.\n   It makes sense to name schools within districts.\
    \  However districts\n   often have the same name as a city or county so there\
    \ has to be a way\n   to distinguish a public school district name from some other\
    \ type of\n   locality name.  The keyword \"K12\" is used for this.\n   For example,\
    \ typical K12 school names currently used are:\n              IVY.PRS.K12.NJ.US\n\
    \              DMHS.JCPS.K12.KY.US\n              OHS.EUNION.K12.CA.US\n     \
    \         BOHS.BREA.K12.CA.US\n   These names are generally longer than the old\
    \ alternative of shorter\n   names in the EDU domain, but that would not have\
    \ lasted long without\n   a significant number of schools finding that their \"\
    obviously\n   correct\" name has already been used by some other school.\n   When\
    \ there are many things to name some of the names will be long.\n   In some cases\
    \ there may be appropriate abbreviations that can be\n   used.  For example Hamilton\
    \ High School in Los Angeles could be:\n              Hami.Hi.LA.K12.CA.US\n \
    \  If a school has a number of PCs, then each PC should have a name.\n   Suppose\
    \ they are named \"alpha\", \"beta\", ... then if they belong to a\n   school\
    \ named \"Lincoln.High.Lakewood.K12.CA.US\" their names would be:\n          \
    \      alpha.Lincoln.High.Lakewood.K12.CA.US.\n                beta.Lincoln.High.Lakewood.K12.CA.US\n\
    \                ...\n   The K12 subdomain provides two points at which to delegate\
    \ a branch\n   of the database to distinct administrators -- the K12 Administrator\n\
    \   for each state, and the district administrator for each district\n   within\
    \ a state.\n   The US Domain Administrator will delegate a branch of the US domain\n\
    \   to an appropriate party.  In some cases, this may be a particular\n   school,\
    \ a school district, or ever all of K12 for a state.\n   The responsibility for\
    \ managing a K12 branch or sub-branch may be\n   delegated to an appropriate volunteer.\
    \  We envision that such\n   delegations of the schools' DNS service may eventually\
    \ migrate to\n   someone else \"more appropriate\" from an administrative organizational\n\
    \   point of view.  The \"obvious\" state agency to manage the schools' DNS\n\
    \   branch may take some time to get up to speed on Internetting.  In the\n  \
    \ meantime, we can have the more advanced schools up and running.\n   Special\
    \ Schools and Service Units\n   In many states, there are special schools that\
    \ are not in districts\n   that are run directly by the state or by consortiums.\
    \  There are also\n   service units that provide \"educational services\" ranging\
    \ from books\n   and computers to janitorial supplies and building maintenance.\
    \  Often\n   these service units do not have a one-to-one relationship with\n\
    \   districts.\n   There is some concern about naming these schools and service\
    \ units\n   within the naming structure for schools established in this memo.\n\
    \   There are several possibilities.  For a state with many service units\n  \
    \ creating a \"pseudo district\" ESU (or whatever, the common terminology\n  \
    \ is in that state) is a possibility.  For example, the Johnson service\n   unit\
    \ could be JOHNSON.ESU.K12.CA.US.  For a state with a few such\n   service units\
    \ (and avoiding conflicts with district names) the\n   service units could be\
    \ directly under K12.  For example,\n   TIES.K12.MN.US.\n   The special public\
    \ funded schools can be handled in a similar\n   fashion.  If there are many special\
    \ schools in a state, a \"pseudo\n   district\" should be established and all\
    \ the special schools listed\n   under it.  For example, suppose there is a \"\
    pseudo district\" in\n   Massachusetts called SPCL, and there is a special school\
    \ called the\n   Progressive Computer Institute, then that school could have the\
    \ name\n   PCI.SPCL.K12.MA.US.  If there are only a few special schools, they\n\
    \   can be listed directly under K12 (avoiding name conflicts with\n   district\
    \ names).  For example, the California Academy of Math and\n   Science is CAMS.K12.CA.US.\
    \  CAMS is sponsored by seven schools, the\n   California Department of Education,\
    \ and a University.\n   \"PVT\" Private Schools\n   Private schools may be thought\
    \ of as businesses.  Public schools are\n   in districts, and districts provide\
    \ a natural organizational\n   structure for naming and delegation.  For private\
    \ schools there are\n   no districts and they really do operate like businesses.\
    \  But, many\n   people are upset to think about their children in a private school\n\
    \   being in a business category and not in K12 with the rest of the\n   children.\
    \  To accommodate both public and private schools, in each\n   state's K12 branch,\
    \ we've added an artificial district called private\n   or \"PVT\".  This gives\
    \ a private school the option of registering like\n   a business under \"locality\"\
    \ or in the PVT.K12.<state-code>.US branch.\n   For example:\n      Crossroads.PVT.K12.CA.US\n\
    \      Crossroads-Santa-Monica.CA.US\n   A public school \"Oak High\" in the \"\
    Woodward\" school district in\n   California would have a name like \"Oak-High.Woodward.K12.CA.US\"\
    .\n   A private school \"Old Trail\" in Pasadena, California could have the\n\
    \   <locality> based name \"Old-Trail.Pasadena.CA.US\" or the private\n   school\
    \ base name \"Old-Trail.PVT.K12.CA.US\".\n   Some suggest that for private schools\
    \ instead of a special pseudo\n   district PVT to use a locality name.  One reason\
    \ to use district\n   names is that, in time, it seems likely that school district\n\
    \   administrators will take over the operation of the DNS for their\n   district.\
    \  One needs to be able to delegate at that branch point.\n   One implication\
    \ of delegation is that the delegatee is now in charge\n   of a chunk of the name\
    \ space and will be registering new names. To\n   keep names unique one can't\
    \ have two different people registering new\n   things below identically named\
    \ branches.\n   For example, if there is a school district named Pasadena and\
    \ a city\n   named Pasadena, the branch of the name space PASADENA.K12.CA.US might\n\
    \   be delegated to the administrator of that public school district.  If\n  \
    \ a private school in Pasadena wanted to be registered in the DNS, it\n   would\
    \ have to get the public school district administrator to do it\n   (perhaps unlikely)\
    \ or not be in the K12 branch at all (unless there\n   is the PVT pseudo district).\n\
    \   So, if private schools are registered by\n   <school>.<locality>.K12.<state-code>.US\
    \ and public schools are\n   registered by <school>.<district>.K12.<state-code>.US,\
    \ there can't be\n   any locality names that are the same as district names or\
    \ the\n   delegation of these will get very tricky later.\n   If it is all done\
    \ by locality names rather than district names, and\n   public and private schools\
    \ are mixed together, then finding an\n   appropriate party to delegate the locality\
    \ to may be difficult.\n   Another suggestion was that private schools be registered\
    \ directly\n   under K12, while public schools must be under a district under\
    \ K12.\n   This would require the operator of the K12 branch to register all\n\
    \   districts and private schools himself (checking for name uniqueness),\n  \
    \ he couldn't easily delegate the registration of the private schools\n   to anyone\
    \ else.\n   Community Colleges and Technical Schools\n   To distinguish Community\
    \ Colleges and Technical/Vocational schools,\n   the keywords \"CC\" and \"TEC\"\
    \ have been created.\n   Some School Examples\n   Hamilton.High.LA-Unified.K12.CA.US\
    \        <== a public school\n   Sherman-Oaks.Elem.LA-Unified.K12.CA.US    <==\
    \ a public school\n   John-Muir.Middle.Santa-Monica.K12.CA.US   <== a public school\n\
    \   Crossroads-School.Santa-Monica.CA.US      <== a private school\n   SMCC.CC.CA.US\
    \                             <== a community college\n   TECMCC.CC.CA.US    \

    \      <== a technical college\n   Northridge.CSU.STATE.CA.US                <==\
    \ a state university\n   2.4  State Agencies\n   Several states are setting up\
    \ networks to interconnect the offices of\n   state government agencies.  The\
    \ hosts in such networks should be\n   registered under the STATE.<state-code>.US\
    \ branch.\n   A US Domain name space has been established for the state government\n\
    \   agencies.  For example, in the State of Minnesota, the subdomain is\n   STATE.MN.US.\n\
    \      State Agencies:\n      ---------------\n      Senate.STATE.MN.US      <==\
    \ State Senate\n      MDH.STATE.MN.US         <== Dept. of Health\n      CALTRANS.STATE.CA.US\
    \    <== Dept. of Transportation\n      DMV.STATE.CA.US         <== Dept. of Motor\
    \ Vehicles\n   2.5  Federal Agencies\n   A federal name space has been established\
    \ for the federal government\n   agencies.  For example, the subdomain for the\
    \ Federal Reserve Bank of\n   Minneapolis is MNPL.FRB.FED.US. Other examples are\
    \ listed below.\n      Federal Government Agencies:\n      ---------------------------\n\
    \      Senate.FED.US   <====  US Senate\n      DOD.FED.US      <====  US Defense\
    \ Dept.\n      USPS.FED.US     <====  US Postal Service\n      VA.FED.US     \
    \  <====  US Veterans Administration\n      IRS.FED.US      <====  US Internal\
    \ Revenue Service\n      Yosemite.NPS.Interior.FED.US    <====  A Federal agency\n\
    \   2.6  Distributed National Institutes\n   The \"DNI\" branch was created directly\
    \ under the top-level US.  This\n   is to be used for organizations that span\
    \ state, regional, and other\n   organizational boundaries; are national in scope,\
    \ and have\n   distributed facilities.  An example would be:\n      Distributed\
    \ National Institutes:\n      --------------------------------\n      MetaCenter.DNI.US\
    \   <====  The MetaCenter Supercomputer Centers\n   The MetaCenter domain encompasses\
    \ the four NSF sponsored\n   supercomputer centers. These are:\n       San Diego\
    \ Supercomputer Center (SDSC)\n       National Center for Supercomputing Applications\
    \ (NCSA)\n       Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC)\n       Cornell Theory\
    \ Center (CTC)\n   The MetaCenter Network will enable applications and services\
    \ like\n   file systems and archival storage to be operated in a distributed\n\
    \   fashion; thus, allowing the resources at the four centers to appear\n   integrated\
    \ and \"seamless\" to users of the centers.\n   2.7  General Independent Entities\n\
    \   This name space was created for organizations that don't really fit\n   anywhere\
    \ else, such as state-wide associations, clubs, and \"domain\n   parks\".  Think\
    \ of this as the miscellaneous category.\n   The examples are state-wide clubs.\
    \  For example, the Garden Club of\n   Arizona, might want to be \"GARDEN.GEN.AZ.US\"\
    .  Such a club has\n   membership from all over the state and is not associated\
    \ with any one\n   city (or locality).  Another example is \"domain parks\" that\
    \ have been\n   established up-to-now as entities in ORG.  For example, there\
    \ is\n   \"LONESTAR.ORG\", which is a kind of computer club in Texas that has\n\
    \   lots of dial-in computers registered.  In the US Domain such an\n   entity\
    \ might have a name like \"LONESTAR.GEN.TX.US\".\n   The organizations registered\
    \ in GEN may typically be non-profit\n   entities.  These organizations don't\
    \ fit in a <locality> and are not\n   a school, library, or state agency.  Ordinary\
    \ businesses are not\n   registered in GEN.\n   Some suggest that these kinds\
    \ of organizations are just like all the\n   other things and ought to be registered\
    \ under some <locality>.  This\n   may be true, but sometimes one just can't find\
    \ any way to convince\n   the applicant that it is the right thing to do.  One\
    \ can argue that\n   any organization has to have a headquarters, or an office,\
    \ or\n   something about it that is in a fixed place, and thus the\n   organization\
    \ could be registered in that place.\n   Some suggest that no token is needed,\
    \ these entities could be\n   directly under the <state-code>.  The problem with\
    \ not having a\n   token, is that you can't delegate the responsibility for registering\n\
    \   these entities to someone separate from whoever is responsible for\n   the\
    \ <state-code>.  You want to be able to delegate for both name-\n   uniqueness\
    \ reasons, and operational management reasons.  Having a\n   token there makes\
    \ both easy.\n      General Independent Entities:\n      -----------------------------\n\

    \  2.8  Examples of Names\n      For small entities like individuals or small\
    \ businesses, there is\n      usually no problem with selecting locality based\
    \ names.\n            For example:  Zuckys.Santa-Monica.CA.US\n      For large\
    \ entities like large corporations with multiple\n      facilities in several\
    \ cities or states this often seems like an\n      unreasonable constraint (especially\
    \ when compared with the\n      alternative of registering directly in the COM\
    \ domain).  However,\n      a company does have a headquarters office in a particular\
    \ locality\n      and so could register with that name. Example: IBM.Armonk.NY.US\n\

- title: 3. REGISTRATION
  contents:
  - "3. REGISTRATION\n   There are two types of registrations (1) Delegation, where\
    \ a branch\n   of the US Domain is delegated to an organization running name servers\n\
    \   to support that branch; or (2) Direct Registration, in which the\n   information\
    \ is put directly into the main database.\n   In Direct Registration there are\
    \ two cases: (a) an IP-host (with an\n   IP address), and (b) non-IP host (for\
    \ example, a UUCP host).  Any\n   particular registration will involve any one\
    \ of these three\n   situations.\n   3.1  Requirements\n   Anyone requesting to\
    \ register a host in the US Domain is sent a copy\n   of the \"Instructions for\
    \ the US Domain Template\", and must fill out a\n   US Domain template.\n   The\
    \ US Domain template, is similar to the InterNIC Domain template,\n   but it is\
    \ not the same.  To request a copy of the US Domain template,\n   send a message\
    \ to the US Domain registrar (us-domain@isi.edu).\n   If you are registering a\
    \ name in a delegated zone, please register\n   with the contact for that zone.\
    \  You can FTP the file \"in-notes/us-\n   domain-delegated.txt\" from venera.isi.edu,\
    \ via anonymous FTP.  This\n   information is also available via email from RFC-INFO@ISI.EDU\n\
    \   (include as the only text in the message\n   \"Help: us_domain_delegated_domains\"\
    ).\n   The key people must have electronic mailboxes (that work).  Please\n  \
    \ provide all the information indicated in the \"Administrator\" and\n   \"Technical\
    \ Contact\" slots.\n   The administrator will be the point of contact for any\
    \ administrative\n   and policy questions about the domain. The administrator\
    \ is usually\n   the person who manages the organization being registered.\n \
    \  The technical contact can also be administrator, or the systems\n   person,\
    \ or someone who is familiar with the technical details of the\n   Internet. \
    \ The technical contact should have a valid working email\n   address.  This is\
    \ necessary in case something goes wrong.\n   It is important that your \"Return-Path\"\
    \ and \"From\" field indicate an\n   Internet-style address.  UUCP-style addresses\
    \ such as \"host1!user\"\n   will not work.  This is fine within the UUCP world,\
    \ but not the\n   Internet.  If you want people on the Internet to be able to\
    \ send mail\n   to you, your return path needs to be an Internet-style address\
    \ such\n   as: host1!user@Internet.gateway.host or user@Internet.gateway.host.\n\
    \   It is also possible to register through one of the Internet service\n   providers\
    \ that have established working relationships with the US\n   Domain Administrator.\n\
    \   If everything checks out, the turn around time for registering a host\n  \
    \ is usually a few days.  The name servers are updated anywhere from 12\n   to\
    \ 24 hours later.\n   There are two ways to be registered in the US Domain, directly,\
    \ or by\n   delegation.\n   3.2  Direct Entries\n   Direct entry in the database\
    \ of the US Domain appeals most to\n   individuals and small companies.  You may\
    \ fill out the application\n   and send it directly to the US Domain Administrator.\
    \  If you are in\n   an area where the zone is delegated to someone else your\
    \ request will\n   be forwarded to the zone administrator for your registration.\
    \  Or,\n   you may send the form directly to the manager of a delegated zone\n\
    \   (see Section 3.1).\n   3.2.1 IP-Hosts\n   These are hosts with IP addresses\
    \ which correspond to \"A\" records in\n   the DNS database.\n   3.2.2 Non-IP\
    \ Hosts\n   Many applicants have hosts in the UUCP world.  Some are one hop away,\n\
    \   some two and three hops away from their \"Internet Forwarder\", this is\n\
    \   acceptable.  What is important is getting an Internet host to be your\n  \
    \ forwarder.  If you do not already have an Internet forwarder, there\n   are\
    \ several businesses that provide this service for a fee, such as\n   UUNET.UU.NET\
    \ (postmaster@uunet.uu.net), PSI (postmaster@UU2.PSI.COM)\n   and CERFNET (help@cerf.net).\
    \  Sometimes local colleges in your area\n   are already on the Internet and may\
    \ be willing to act as an Internet\n   Forwarder.  You would need to work this\
    \ out with the systems\n   administrator as we cannot make these arrangements\
    \ for you.\n   Although we work with UUCP service providers, the Internet US Domain\n\
    \   registration is not affiliated with the registration of UUCP Map\n   entries.\
    \  The UUCP map entry does not provide us with sufficient\n   information.  If\
    \ you do not have a copy of the US Domain\n   questionnaire template, please send\
    \ a message to: us-domain@isi.edu\n   and request one.  See Appendix-II.\n   The\
    \ example below is not an appropriate registration for the US Domain.\n     #N\

    \ registering your host as a central site for a USENET group\n   where other UUCP\
    \ sites will feed from you, that's fine.  These UUCP\n   sites do not need to\
    \ register.  If however, the other sites become a\n   subdomain of your hostname,\
    \ then we will need to register them\n   individually or add a wildcard record.\
    \ (See Section 4.4. Wildcards).\n           For example:          bah.rochester.ny.us\n\
    \                           host1.bah.rochester.ny.us\n                      \
    \     host2.bah.rochester.ny.us\n   To use US Domain names for non-IP hosts, there\
    \ must be a forwarder\n   host that is an IP host.  There must be an administrative\
    \ agreement\n   and a technical procedure for relaying mail between the non-IP\
    \ host\n   and the forwarder host.\n   Case 1:\n   -------\n   Your host is not\
    \ an IP host but does talk directly with a host that\n   is an IP host.\n    \
    \                                              +-----------------+\n   +----------+\
    \            +---------+            |                 |\n   |your-host |---UUCP-----|forwarder|----IP/TCP--|\
    \    INTERNET     |\n   +----------+            +---------+            |     \
    \            |\n                                                  +-----------------+\n\
    \   \"Forwarder\" must be an IP host on the Internet.\n   You must ask \"forwarder\"\
    \ if they are willing to be the Internet\n   forwarder for \"your-host\".\n  \
    \ In the US Domain of the DNS data base there must be an entry like\n   this:\n\
    \          \"your-host\"  MX  10  \"forwarder\"\n   This must be entered by the\
    \ US Domain Administrator.\n   In the \"forwarder\" routing tables there must\
    \ be information about\n   \"your-host\" with a rule like: If I see mail for \"\
    your-host\" I will\n   send it via uucp by calling phone number \"123-4567\".\n\
    \   Case 2:\n   -------\n   In this case your hosts talks to another host that\
    \ ... that talks to\n   an IP host.  In other words, there are multiple hops between\
    \ your host\n   and the Internet.\n                                          \
    \        +-----------------+\n   +----------+            +---------+         \

    \      UUCP\n       |\n   +----------+\n   |your-host |\n   +----------+\n   \"\
    Forwarder\" must be an IP host on the Internet.\n   You must ask \"forwarder\"\
    \ if they are willing to be the Internet\n   Forwarder for \"Your-Host\".  You\
    \ must ask \"path-host\" to relay your\n   mail.\n   In the US Domain of the DNS\
    \ Database there must be an entry like this:\n          \"your-host\"  MX  10\
    \  \"forwarder\"\n   This must be entered by the US Domain Administrator.\n  \
    \ In the \"forwarder\" routing tables there must be information about\n   \"your-host\"\
    \ with a rule like: If I see mail for \"your-host\" I will\n   send it via UUCP\
    \ to \"path-host\" by calling phone number \"123-4567\".\n   and \"path-host\"\
    \ must also know how to relay the mail to \"your-host\".\n   Note: It is assumed\
    \ that \"path-host\" is already MXed to \"forwarder\".\n   It is not appropriate\
    \ to ask to MX \"your-host\" to \"path-host\" (this\n   is sometimes called double\
    \ MXing).  The host on the right hand side\n   of an MX entry must be a host on\
    \ the Internet with an IP address\n   (e.g., 128.9.2.32).\n   3.3  Delegated Subdomains\n\
    \   Many branches of the US Domain are delegated. There must be a\n   knowledgeable\
    \ and competent technical contact, familiar with the\n   Internet DNS.  This requirement\
    \ is easily satisified if the technical\n   contact already runs some other name\
    \ servers.\n   Examples of delegations are K12.TX.US for the Kindergarten through\n\
    \   12th Grade public schools in Texas, the locality \"berkeley.ca.us\", or\n\
    \   the LIB.MN.US branch for the libraries in Minnesota.\n   The administrator\
    \ of the US Domain is responsible for the assignment\n   of all the DNS names\
    \ that end with \".US\".  Of course, one person or\n   even one group can't handle\
    \ all this in the long run so portions of\n   the name space are delegated to\
    \ others.\n   The major concern in selecting a designated manager for a domain\
    \ is\n   that it be able to carry out the necessary responsibilities, and have\n\
    \   the ability to do an equitable, just, honest, and competent job.\n   The key\
    \ requirement is that for each domain there be a designated\n   manager for supervising\
    \ that domain's name space.\n   These designated authorities are trustees for\
    \ the delegated domain,\n   and have a duty to serve the community.\n   The designated\
    \ manager is the trustee of the domain for the domain\n   itself and the global\
    \ Internet community.\n   Concerns about \"rights\" and \"ownership\" of domains\
    \ are inappropriate.\n   It is appropriate to be concerned about \"responsibilities\"\
    \ and\n   \"service\" to the community.\n   The designated manager must be equitable\
    \ to all groups in the domain\n   that request domain names.\n   This means that\
    \ the same rules are applied to all requests.  All\n   requests must be processed\
    \ in a nondiscriminatory fashion, and\n   academic and commercial (and other)\
    \ users are treated on an equal\n   basis.  No bias shall be shown regarding requests\
    \ that may come from\n   customers of some other business related to the manager\
    \ -- e.g., no\n   preferential service for customers of a particular data network\n\
    \   provider.  There can be no requirement that a particular mail system\n   (or\
    \ other application), protocol, or product be used.\n   There are no requirements\
    \ on subdomains beyond the requirements on\n   higher-level domains themselves.\
    \  That is, the requirements are\n   applied recursively.  In particular, all\
    \ subdomains shall be allowed\n   to operate their own domain name servers, providing\
    \ in them whatever\n   information the subdomain manager sees fit (as long as\
    \ it is true and\n   correct).\n   Significantly interested parties in the domain\
    \ should agree that the\n   designated manager is the appropriate party.\n   The\
    \ US Domain Administrator tries to have any contending parties\n   reach agreement\
    \ among themselves, and generally takes no action to\n   change things unless\
    \ all the contending parties agree; only in cases\n   where the designated manager\
    \ has substantially neglected their\n   responsibilities would the US Domain Administrator\
    \ step in.\n   The designated manager must do a satisfactory job of operating\
    \ the\n   DNS service for the domain.\n   That is, the actual management of the\
    \ assigning of domain names,\n   delegating subdomains and operating name servers\
    \ must be done with\n   technical competence.  This includes keeping the US Domain\n\
    \   Administrator or other higher-level domain managers advised of the\n   status\
    \ of the domain, responding to requests in a timely manner, and\n   operating\
    \ the database with accuracy, robustness, and resilience.\n   There must be a\
    \ primary and a secondary name server that have IP\n   connectivity to the Internet\
    \ and can be easily checked for\n   operational status and database accuracy by\
    \ the US Domain\n   Administrator.\n   One of the aspects of having two name servers\
    \ for each domain (or\n   zone), is for robustness.  One concern under this heading\
    \ is that the\n   name service not go out entirely if there is a local power failure\n\
    \   (earthquake, tornado, or other disaster).\n   Name Servers should be in distinctly\
    \ separate physical locations.  It\n   is appropriate to have more than two name\
    \ servers, but there must be\n   at least two.\n   For any transfer of the designated\
    \ manager trusteeship from one\n   organization to another, the higher-level domain\
    \ manager must receive\n   communications from both the old organization and the\
    \ new\n   organization that assures the US Domain Administrator that the\n   transfer\
    \ in mutually agreed, and that the new organization\n   understands its responsibilities.\n\
    \   It is also very helpful for the US Domain Administrator to receive\n   communications\
    \ from other parties that may be concerned or affected\n   by the transfer.\n\
    \   Delegation of cities, companies within cities, schools (K12),\n   community\
    \ colleges (CC), libraries (LIB), state government (STATE),\n   and federal government\
    \ agencies (FED), etc., is acceptable and\n   practical.\n   For a delegated portion\
    \ of the name space, for example a city, no\n   alterations can be made to that\
    \ name, no abbreviations added, etc.\n   unless applied for.\n   Sometimes there\
    \ may be two people running name servers in the same\n   city because different\
    \ portions of the name space has been delegated\n   to them.  For example, someone\
    \ may be delegated the <city>.<state>.US\n   name space, and someone else from\
    \ a state government agency may have\n   the .STATE.<state>.US, portion.  For\
    \ example, Fred may run the name\n   servers for Sacramento.CA.US and Joe may\
    \ run the name servers for\n   STATE.CA.US in Sacramento.\n   If a company would\
    \ like to have wildcard records added, or run their\n   own name servers in a\
    \ city that we have delegated name space to, this\n   is acceptable.\n   Delegation\
    \ of the whole State name space is not yet implemented.  The\n   delegated part\
    \ of the name space is in the form of:\n               .<locality>.<state>.US.\n\
    \            .CI.<locality>.<state>.US.\n            .CO.<locality>.<state>.US.\n\
    \                    .STATE.<state>.US.\n                      .K12.<state>.US.\n\
    \                   PVT.K12.<state>.US.\n                       .CC.<state>.US.\n\
    \                      .TEC.<state>.US.\n                      .LIB.<state>.US.\n\
    \                      .GEN.<state>.US.\n                              .DNI.US.\n\
    \                              .FED.US.\n   3.3.1.  Delegation Requirements\n\
    \   When a subdomain is delegated, the following requirements must be\n   met:\n\
    \      1)  There must be a knowledgeable and competent technical contact,\n  \
    \        familiar with the Internet DNS.  This requirement is easily\n       \
    \   satisified if the technical contact already runs some other\n          name\
    \ servers.\n      2)  Organizations requesting delegations must provide at least\
    \ two\n          independent (robust and reliable) DNS name servers in\n     \
    \     physically separate locations on the Internet.\n      3)  The subdomain\
    \ must accept all applicants on an equal basis.\n      4)  The subdomain must\
    \ provide timely processing of requests.  To\n          do this, it is helpful\
    \ to have several individuals\n          knowledgeable about the procedures so\
    \ that the operations are\n          not delayed due to one persons unavailability\
    \ (for example, by\n          being on vacation).\n      5)  The subdomain manager\
    \ must tell the US Domain Administrator\n          when there are changes in the\
    \ name servers that should be\n          reflected in the US Domain zone files,\
    \ or changes in the\n          contact information.\n   K12 Administrators\n \
    \     In the long term, registering schools will be a big job.  So you\n     \
    \ need to have in mind delegating parts of the work to various\n      school districts.\
    \  If you can delegate every school district in\n      the state then you are\
    \ finished, except for checking that they are\n      all operating correctly.\
    \  However, initially you will have quite a\n      bit to do with educating people,\
    \ helping them choose names and\n      getting name servers arranged.  You are\
    \ responsible for seeing\n      that the naming of schools follow the guidelines\
    \ suggested in this\n      memo.\n      All K12 Administrators will initially\
    \ be responsible for managing\n      the \"pseudo district\" PVT for private schools.\
    \  Private schools\n      have the option of registering as <school-name>.PVT.K12.<state>.US\n\
    \      or as a business under the city based names.\n   Locality Administrators\n\
    \      If you have been delegated a locality subdomain, you will be\n      responsible\
    \ for registering not only businesses directly under the\n      locality, but\
    \ city and county agencies under the \"CI\" and \"CO\"\n      branches.  When\
    \ appropriate these branches should be delegated.\n      If you want, you may\
    \ spell out \"CITY\" instead of \"CI\" or \"COUNTY\"\n      instead of \"CO\"\
    , but you must be consistent and use only one or\n      the other in a given locality.\
    \  The whole city government should\n      be under one branch.\n   WHOIS Database\n\
    \      Only the second and third level delegated name spaces will be\n      entered\
    \ in the WHOIS database.  For example, K12.CA.US would have\n      an entry in\
    \ WHOIS.  Anything under K12.CA.US will not be listed.\n      The US Domain Administrator\
    \ will send the information that you\n      supplied on your US Domain template\
    \ to the InterNIC.  It is the\n      hope that in the future, each delegated subdomain\
    \ will provide\n      their own WHOIS directory database for their branch.\n \
    \  3.3.2  Delegation Procedures\n   The procedure that is followed when a subdomain\
    \ is delegated includes\n   the following steps:\n      1)  Evaluate the technical\
    \ contact's experience with DNS.  Make\n          sure there is a need for the\
    \ proposed delegation.  Make sure\n          the technical contact has the information\
    \ about the US Domain\n          and the suggested naming structure.  Two contacts\
    \ with email\n          addresses are necessary in case something goes wrong.\n\
    \      2)  Add the new technical contact to the \"us-dom-adm\" mailing list\n\
    \          for distributing updates concerning the US Domain policies and\n  \
    \        procedures.\n      3)  Delete any hosts from our zone file that belongs\
    \ in the newly\n          delegated subdomain and make sure they now have the\
    \ hosts in\n          their zone file.\n      4)  Send them a copy of the zone\
    \ file so their initial zone file\n          is identical to ours. For example:\n\

- title: 4. DATABASE INFORMATION
  contents:
  - "4. DATABASE INFORMATION\n   4.1. Name Servers\n   Name servers are the repositories\
    \ of information that make up the\n   domain database.  The database is divided\
    \ up into sections called\n   zones, which are distributed among the name servers.\
    \  While name\n   servers can have several optional functions and sources of data,\
    \ the\n   essential task of a name server is to answer queries using data in\n\
    \   its zones.  The response to a query can always be generated using\n   only\
    \ local data, and either contains the answer to the question or a\n   referral\
    \ to other name servers \"closer\" to the desired information.\n   A given zone\
    \ will be available from several name servers to insure\n   its availability in\
    \ spite of host or communication link failure.\n   Every zone is required to be\
    \ available on at least two servers, and\n   many zones have more redundancy than\
    \ that.\n   The US Domain is currently supported by seven name servers:\n    \
    \       venera.isi.edu\n           ns.isi.edu\n           rs.internic.net\n  \
    \         ns.csl.sri.com\n           ns.uu.net\n           adm.brl.mil\n     \
    \      excalibur.usc.edu\n   4.2 Zone Files\n   A \"zone\" is a registry of domains\
    \ kept by a particular organization.\n   A zone registry is \"authoritative\"\
    , that is, the master copy of the\n   registry is kept by the zone organization,\
    \ and this copy is, by\n   definition, always up-to-date.  Copies of this registry\
    \ may be\n   distributed to other places and kept in caches, but these caches\
    \ are\n   not authoritative, and may be out-of-date.\n   Every zone has at least\
    \ one node, and hence domain name, for which it\n   is authoritative, and all\
    \ of the nodes in a particular zone are\n   connected.  Given the tree structure,\
    \ every zone has a highest node\n   which is closer to the root than any other\
    \ node in the zone.  The\n   name of this node is often used to identify the zone.\
    \  The data that\n   describes a zone has four major parts:\n        1) Authoritative\
    \ data for all nodes within the zone.\n        2) Data that defines the top node\
    \ of the zone\n           (can be thought of as part of the authoritative data).\n\
    \        3) Data that describes delegated subzones, i.e., cuts\n           around\
    \ the bottom of the zone,\n        4) Data that allows access to name servers\
    \ for subzones\n           (sometimes called \"glue\" data).\n   The zone administrator\
    \ has to maintain the zones at all the name\n   servers which are authoritative\
    \ for the zone.  When the changes are\n   made, they must be distributed to all\
    \ of the name servers.\n   Copies of the zone files are not available unless you\
    \ are on the\n   Internet.  To look at the zone files use the \"dig\" program\
    \ of the DNS\n   domain name system.\n        dig   @nshost  host-your-checking\
    \  axfr\n   4.3 Resource Records\n   Records in the zone data files are called\
    \ resource records (RRs).\n   The standard Resource records (RR) are specified\
    \ in STD 13, RFC 1034\n   and STD 13, RFC 1035 (3,4).  An RR has a standard format\
    \ as shown.\n                  <name> [<ttl>] [<class>] <type> <data>\n   The\
    \ first field is always the name of the domain record.  The second\n   field is\
    \ an optional time to live field.  This specifies how long\n   this data will\
    \ be stored in the data base.  The third field is the\n   address class; the class\
    \ field specifies the protocol group most\n   often this is the Internet class\
    \ \"IN\".  The fourth field states the\n   type of the resource record.  The fields\
    \ after that are dependent on\n   the Type of RR.  The fifth field is the data\
    \ field which is defined\n   differently for each type and class of data.  Here\
    \ is a list of the\n   current commonly used types:\n           SOA     Start\
    \ of Authority\n           NS      Name Server\n           A       Internet Address\n\
    \           CNAME   Canonical Name (nickname pointer)\n           HINFO   Host\
    \ Information\n           WKS     Well Known Services\n           MX      Mail\
    \ Exchanger\n           PTR     Pointer\n   What do the fields mean?\n       \
    \    foo.LA.CA.US.    604800    MX   10     Venera.ISI.EDU.\n           (1)  \
    \            (2)       (3)  (4)    (5)\n           1)  domain name\n         \
    \  2)  time to live information\n           3)  mail exchanger record\n      \
    \     4)  preference value to determine (if more than one\n               forwarder)\
    \ which mailer to use first, lower number\n               higher preference\n\
    \           5)  the Internet forwarding host.\n   4.3.1  \"A\" Records\n   Internet\
    \ (IP) Address.  The data for an \"A\" record is an Internet\n   address in a\
    \ dotted decimal form.  A sample \"A\" record might look\n   like:\n         \
    \  venera.isi.edu.          A      128.9.0.32\n              (name)          \
    \     (A)     (address)\n   The name field is the machine name, and the address\
    \ is the network\n   address.  There should be only one \"A\" record for each\
    \ address of a\n   host.\n   4.3.2  CNAME Records\n   Canonical Name resource\
    \ record, CNAME, specifies an alias for a\n   canonical name.  This is essentially\
    \ a pointer to the official name\n   for the requested name.  All other RRs appear\
    \ under this official\n   name.  A machine named FERNWOOD.MPK.CA.US may want to\
    \ have the\n   nickname ANTERIOR.MPK.CA.US.  In that case, the following RR would\
    \ be\n   used:\n           anterior.mpk.ca.us.     CNAME      fernwood.mpk.ca.us.\n\
    \            (alias nickname)                   (canonical name)\n   Nicknames\
    \ (the name associated with the RR is the nickname) may be\n   added for awhile\
    \ when a host changes its name, usually because it\n   moves to another state.\
    \  It helps to have this CNAME pointer so if\n   any mail comes to the old address\
    \ it will get forwarded to the new\n   one.  There cannot be any other RRs associated\
    \ with a nickname of the\n   same class.\n   4.3.3  MX Records\n   Mail Exchanger\
    \ records, MX, are used to specify a machine that knows\n   how to deliver mail\
    \ to a machine that is not directly connected to\n   the Internet.  For example,\
    \ venera.isi.edu is the mail gateway that\n   knows how to deliver mail to foo.la.ca.us,\
    \ but other machines on the\n   network cannot deliver mail directly to foo.la.ca.us.\
    \  These two\n   machines may have a private connection or use a different transport\n\
    \   medium (such as uucp).  The preference value (10) is the order that a\n  \
    \ mailer should follow when there is more than one way to deliver mail\n   to\
    \ a single machine.  The lower the number the higher the preference.\n       \
    \    foo.LA.CA.US.  604800  MX  10  Venera.ISI.EDU.\n           foo.LA.CA.US.\
    \  604800  MX  20  relay1.uu.net.\n   4.3.4   HINFO Records\n   Host information\
    \ resource records, HINFO is for host specific data.\n   This lists the hardware\
    \ and operating system that are running at the\n   listed host.  It should be\
    \ noted that a space separates the hardware\n   information and the operating\
    \ system information.  If you want to\n   include a space in the machine name\
    \ you must quote the name.  Host\n   information is not specific to any class,\
    \ so ANY may be used for the\n   address class.  There should be one HINFO record\
    \ for each host.\n   acb.la.ca.us.       HINFO       VAX-11/780      UNIX\n  \
    \                                 (Hardware)      (Operating System)\n   The official\
    \ HINFO types can be found in the latest Assigned Numbers\n   RFC, the most recent\
    \ edition being STD 2, RFC 1340 [9].  The hardware\n   type is called the Machine\
    \ Name, and the software type is called the\n   System Name.\n   The information\
    \ users supply about this is often inconsistent or\n   incomplete.  Please follow\
    \ the terms in the current \"Assigned\n   Numbers\".\n   4.3.5  PTR Records\n\
    \   A Domain Name Pointer record, PTR, allows special names to point to\n   some\
    \ other location in the domain data base.  These are typically\n   used in setting\
    \ up reverse pointers for the special IN-ADDR.ARPA\n   domain.  PTR names should\
    \ be unique to the zone.\n         0.0.9.128.in-addr.arpa     PTR    isi-net.isi.edu.\n\
    \             (special name)                  (real name)\n   A PTR record is\
    \ to be added to the IN-ADDR.ARPA domain for every \"A\"\n   record registered\
    \ in the US Domain.  These PTR records need to be\n   added by the administrator\
    \ of the network where the host is\n   connected.  The US Domain Administration\
    \ does not administer the\n   network and cannot make these entries in the DNS\
    \ database.\n   4.4  Wildcards\n   The wildcard records are of the form \"*.<anydomain>\"\
    , where\n   <anydomain> is any domain name.  The wildcards potentially apply to\n\
    \   descendents of <anydomain>, but not to <anydomain> itself.\n   For example,\
    \ suppose a large company located in California with a\n   large, non-IP/TCP,\
    \ network wanted to create a mail gateway.  If the\n   company was called DWP.LA.CA.US,\
    \ and the IP/TCP capable gateway\n   machine (Internet forwarder) was called ELROY.JPL.NASA.GOV,\
    \ the\n   following RRs might be entered into the .US zone.\n           dwp.la.ca.us\
    \    MX      10       ELROY.JPL.NASA.GOV\n         *.dwp.la.ca.us    MX      10\
    \       ELROY.JPL.NASA.GOV\n   The wildcard record *.DWP.LA.CA.US would cause\
    \ an MX query for any\n   domain name ending in DWP.LA.CA.US to return an MX RR\
    \ pointing at\n   ELROY.JPL.NASA.GOV. The entry without the \"*\" is needed so\
    \ the host\n   dwp can be found.\n   In the US Domain, wildcard records are allowed\
    \ in our zone files\n   under the organizational subdomain (and where noted otherwise)\
    \ but no\n   wildcard records are allowed under the \"City\" or \"State\" domain.\n\
    \       The authors strongly believe that it is in everyone's\n       interest\
    \ and good for the Internet to have each host\n       explicitly registered (that\
    \ is, we believe that wildcards\n       should not be used), we also realize that\
    \ not everyone\n       agrees with this belief.  Thus, we will allow wildcard\n\
    \       records in the US Domain under groups or organizations.\n       For example,\
    \ *.DWP.LA.CA.US.\n       The reason we feel single entries are the best is by\
    \ the mere\n       fact that if anyone wanted to find one of the hosts in the\n\
    \       domain name system it would be there, and problems can be\n       detected\
    \ more easily.  When using wildcards records all the\n       hosts under a subdomain\
    \ are hidden.\n"
