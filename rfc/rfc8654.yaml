- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The BGP specification (RFC 4271) mandates a maximum BGP message\
    \ size\n   of 4,096 octets.  As BGP is extended to support new Address Family\n\
    \   Identifiers (AFIs), Subsequent AFIs (SAFIs), and other features,\n   there\
    \ is a need to extend the maximum message size beyond 4,096\n   octets.  This\
    \ document updates the BGP specification by extending the\n   maximum message\
    \ size from 4,096 octets to 65,535 octets for all\n   messages except for OPEN\
    \ and KEEPALIVE messages.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The BGP specification [RFC4271] mandates a maximum BGP message\
    \ size\n   of 4,096 octets.  As BGP is extended to support new AFIs, SAFIs, and\n\
    \   other capabilities (e.g., BGPsec [RFC8205] and BGP - Link State (BGP-\n  \
    \ LS) [RFC7752]), there is a need to extend the maximum message size\n   beyond\
    \ 4,096 octets.  This document provides an extension to BGP to\n   extend the\
    \ message size limit from 4,096 octets to 65,535 octets for\n   all messages except\
    \ for OPEN and KEEPALIVE messages.\n"

    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\

- title: 2.  BGP Extended Message
  contents:
  - "2.  BGP Extended Message\n   A BGP message over 4,096 octets in length is a BGP\
    \ Extended Message.\n   BGP Extended Messages have a maximum message size of 65,535\
    \ octets.\n   The smallest message that may be sent is a BGP KEEPALIVE, which\n\
    \   consists of 19 octets.\n"
- title: 3.  BGP Extended Message Capability
  contents:
  - "3.  BGP Extended Message Capability\n   The BGP Extended Message Capability is\
    \ a new BGP capability [RFC5492]\n   defined with Capability Code 6 and Capability\
    \ Length 0.\n   To advertise the BGP Extended Message Capability to a peer, a\
    \ BGP\n   speaker uses BGP Capabilities Advertisement [RFC5492].  By\n   advertising\
    \ the BGP Extended Message Capability to a peer, a BGP\n   speaker conveys that\
    \ it is able to receive and properly handle BGP\n   Extended Messages (see Section\
    \ 4).\n   Peers that wish to use the BGP Extended Message Capability MUST\n  \
    \ support error handling for BGP UPDATE messages per [RFC7606].\n"
- title: 4.  Operation
  contents:
  - "4.  Operation\n   The BGP Extended Message Capability applies to all messages\
    \ except\n   for OPEN and KEEPALIVE messages.  These exceptions reduce the\n \
    \  complexity of providing backward compatibility.\n   A BGP speaker that is capable\
    \ of receiving BGP Extended Messages\n   SHOULD advertise the BGP Extended Message\
    \ Capability to its peers\n   using BGP Capabilities Advertisement [RFC5492].\
    \  A BGP speaker MAY\n   send BGP Extended Messages to a peer only if the BGP\
    \ Extended Message\n   Capability was received from that peer.\n   An implementation\
    \ that advertises the BGP Extended Message Capability\n   MUST be capable of receiving\
    \ a message with a length up to and\n   including 65,535 octets.\n   Applications\
    \ generating information that might be encapsulated within\n   BGP messages MUST\
    \ limit the size of their payload to take the maximum\n   message size into account.\n\
    \   If a BGP message with a length greater than 4,096 octets is received\n   by\
    \ a BGP listener who has not advertised the BGP Extended Message\n   Capability,\
    \ the listener will generate a NOTIFICATION with the Error\n   Subcode set to\
    \ Bad Message Length ([RFC4271], Section 6.1).\n   A BGP UPDATE will (if allowed\
    \ by policy, best path, etc.) typically\n   propagate throughout the BGP-speaking\
    \ Internet and hence to BGP\n   speakers that may not support BGP Extended Messages.\
    \  Therefore, an\n   announcement in a BGP Extended Message where the size of\
    \ the\n   attribute set plus the NLRI is larger than 4,096 octets may cause\n\
    \   lack of reachability.\n   A BGP speaker that has advertised the BGP Extended\
    \ Message Capability\n   to its peers may receive an UPDATE from one of its peers\
    \ that\n   produces an ongoing announcement that is larger than 4,096 octets.\n\
    \   When propagating that UPDATE onward to a neighbor that has not\n   advertised\
    \ the BGP Extended Message Capability, the speaker SHOULD\n   try to reduce the\
    \ outgoing message size by removing attributes\n   eligible under the \"attribute\
    \ discard\" approach of [RFC7606].  If the\n   message is still too big, then\
    \ it must not be sent to the neighbor\n   ([RFC4271], Section 9.2).  Additionally,\
    \ if the NLRI was previously\n   advertised to that peer, it must be withdrawn\
    \ from service\n   ([RFC4271], Section 9.1.3).\n   If an Autonomous System (AS)\
    \ has multiple internal BGP speakers and\n   also has multiple external BGP neighbors,\
    \ care must be taken to\n   ensure a consistent view within the AS in order to\
    \ present a\n   consistent external view.  In the context of BGP Extended Messages,\
    \ a\n   consistent view can only be guaranteed if all the Internal BGP (iBGP)\n\
    \   speakers advertise the BGP Extended Message Capability.  If that is\n   not\
    \ the case, then the operator should consider whether or not the\n   BGP Extended\
    \ Message Capability should be advertised to external\n   peers.\n   During the\
    \ incremental deployment of BGP Extended Messages and use of\n   the \"attribute\
    \ discard\" approach of [RFC7606] in an iBGP mesh or with\n   External BGP (eBGP)\
    \ peers, the operator should monitor any routes\n   dropped and any discarded\
    \ attributes.\n"
- title: 5.  Error Handling
  contents:
  - "5.  Error Handling\n   A BGP speaker that has the ability to use BGP Extended\
    \ Messages but\n   has not advertised the BGP Extended Message Capability, presumably\n\
    \   due to configuration, MUST NOT accept a BGP Extended Message.  A\n   speaker\
    \ MUST NOT implement a more liberal policy accepting BGP\n   Extended Messages.\n\
    \   A BGP speaker that does not advertise the BGP Extended Message\n   Capability\
    \ might also genuinely not support BGP Extended Messages.\n   Such a speaker will\
    \ follow the error-handling procedures of [RFC4271]\n   if it receives a BGP Extended\
    \ Message.  Similarly, any speaker that\n   treats an improper BGP Extended Message\
    \ as a fatal error MUST follow\n   the error-handling procedures of [RFC4271].\n\
    \   Error handling for UPDATE messages, as specified in Section 6.3 of\n   [RFC4271],\
    \ is unchanged.  However, if a NOTIFICATION is to be sent to\n   a BGP speaker\
    \ that has not advertised the BGP Extended Message\n   Capability, the size of\
    \ the message MUST NOT exceed 4,096 octets.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that BGP protocol\
    \ developers and implementers are\n   conservative in their application and use\
    \ of BGP Extended Messages.\n   Future protocol specifications MUST describe how\
    \ to handle peers that\n   can only accommodate 4,096 octet messages.\n"
- title: 6.  Changes to RFC 4271
  contents:
  - "6.  Changes to RFC 4271\n   [RFC4271] states \"The value of the Length field\
    \ MUST always be at\n   least 19 and no greater than 4096.\"  This document changes\
    \ the latter\n   number to 65,535 for all messages except for OPEN and KEEPALIVE\n\
    \   messages.\n   Section 6.1 of [RFC4271] specifies raising an error if the length\
    \ of\n   a message is over 4,096 octets.  For all messages except for OPEN and\n\
    \   KEEPALIVE messages, if the receiver has advertised the BGP Extended\n   Message\
    \ Capability, this document raises that limit to 65,535.\n"

- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   This extension to BGP does not change BGP's underlying\
    \ security\n   issues [RFC4272].\n   Due to increased memory requirements for\
    \ buffering, there may be\n   increased exposure to resource exhaustion, intentional\
    \ or\n   unintentional.\n   If a remote speaker is able to craft a large BGP Extended\
    \ Message to\n   send on a path where one or more peers do not support BGP Extended\n\
    \   Messages, peers that support BGP Extended Messages may:\n   *  act to reduce\
    \ the outgoing message (see Section 4) and, in doing\n      so, cause an attack\
    \ by discarding attributes one or more of its\n      peers may be expecting. \
    \ The attributes eligible under the\n      \"attribute discard\" approach must\
    \ have no effect on route\n      selection or installation [RFC7606].\n   *  act\
    \ to reduce the outgoing message (see Section 4) and, in doing\n      so, allow\
    \ a downgrade attack.  This would only affect the\n      attacker's message, where\
    \ 'downgrade' has questionable meaning.\n   *  incur resource load (processing,\
    \ message resizing, etc.) when\n      reformatting the large messages.\n"
