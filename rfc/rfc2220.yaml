- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This memorandum provides a mechanism for representing objects which\n\
    \   are files of Machine-Readable Cataloging records (MARC).  The MARC\n   formats\
    \ are standards for the representation and communication of\n   bibliographic\
    \ and related information.  A MARC record contains\n   metadata for an information\
    \ resource following MARC format\n   specifications.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The MARC formats are sets of codes and content designators\
    \ defined\n   for encoding metadata for five types of data: bibliographic,\n \
    \  holdings, authority, classification, and community information.  The\n   structure\
    \ of MARC records is an implementation of national and\n   international standards,\
    \ ANSI Z39.2 (Information Interchange Format)\n   and ISO 2709 (Format for Information\
    \ Interchange).  Codes and\n   conventions in the formats identify and characterize\
    \ data elements\n   within a record and support the manipulation of those data.\n\
    \   MARC formats are communication formats, primarily designed to provide\n  \
    \ specification for the exchange of bibliographic and related\n   information\
    \ between systems.  They are widely used in a variety of\n   exchange and processing\
    \ environments.  They do not mandate internal\n   storage or display formats to\
    \ be used by different systems.\n"
- title: 2.  Definition
  contents:
  - "2.  Definition\n   Since there are different flavors of MARC which would be processed\
    \ by\n   different applications, this content-type/subtype refers to the\n   harmonized\
    \ USMARC/CANMARC specification.  Additional content-\n   types/subtypes may be\
    \ defined in the future (e.g.\n   application/unimarc).\n   MARC records involve\
    \ three elements: the record structure, content\n   designation, and data content.\
    \  Only those records that contain all\n   three elements according to the standard\
    \ would use this content-\n   type/subtype, i.e. content extracted from the structure\
    \ would not.\n   Since MARC does not mandate an internal storage format, parameters\n\
    \   have not been assigned to specific implementations (e.g. OCLC-MARC,\n   LC-MARC,\
    \ etc.).  In addition, parameters have not been defined for\n   the specific type\
    \ of MARC format (e.g. bibliographic, authority,\n   holdings), since the information\
    \ is contained in the Leader portion\n   of the record.\n"

  - "3. Registration Information\n   To: ietf-types@iana.org\n   Media type name:\
    \ application\n   Media subtype name: marc\n   Required parameters: None\n   Optional\
    \ parameters: None\n   Encoding considerations:  MARC records may contain long\
    \ lines and/or\n   arbitrary octet values.  The base64 content-transfer-encoding\
    \ is\n   recommended for transmission of MARC over electronic mail.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   There are no known security risks associated\
    \ with the use or viewing\n   of MARC data.  A MARC record may have security classification\n\
    \   associated with the document it describes or metadata in that record.\n  \
    \ Although this does not present any security risk to the user of MARC\n   data,\
    \ it may provide an opportunity for a security breach for the\n   source of classified\
    \ MARC data.\n"
- title: 5.  Interoperability Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Interoperability Considerations\n   MARC is a communication format and is\
    \ designed for interoperability\n   between different systems that may store data\
    \ in local formats\n   internally.\n"
