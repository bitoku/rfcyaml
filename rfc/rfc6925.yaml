    the\n   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Relay Agent Information\n   option.
    \ The sub-option carries a value that uniquely identifies the\n   relay agent
    device within the administrative domain.  The value is\n   normally administratively
    configured in the relay agent.  The sub-\n   option allows a DHCP relay agent
    to include the identifier in the\n   DHCP messages it sends.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4)
    [RFC2131]\n   provides IP addresses and configuration information for IPv4 clients.\n
    \  It includes a relay agent capability, in which network elements\n   receive
    broadcast messages from clients and forward them to DHCP\n   servers as unicast
    messages.  In many network environments, relay\n   agents add information to the
    DHCP messages before forwarding them,\n   using the Relay Agent Information option
    [RFC3046].  Servers that\n   recognize the Relay Agent Information option echo
    it back in their\n   replies.\n   This specification introduces a Relay Agent
    Identifier (Relay-ID)\n   sub-option for the Relay Agent Information option.  The
    Relay-ID sub-\n   option carries a sequence of octets that is intended to uniquely\n
    \  identify the relay agent within the administrative domain.  In this\n   document,
    an administrative domain consists of all DHCP servers and\n   relay agents that
    communicate with each other.\n"

      extending the DHCP\n   Leasequery protocol [RFC4388] to accommodate some additional\n
      \  situations.  [RFC6926] proposes a variety of enhancements to the\n   existing
      Leasequery protocol.  The document describes a use case\n   where a relay agent
      queries DHCP servers using the relay identifier\n   to retrieve all the leases
      allocated through the relay agent.\n"

    - "3.2.  Industrial Ethernet\n   DHCP typically identifies clients based on information
      in their DHCP\n   messages, such as the Client-Identifier option or the value
      of the\n   chaddr field.  In some networks, however, the location of a client
      --\n   its point of attachment to the network -- is a more useful\n   identifier.
      \ In factory-floor networks (commonly called 'industrial'\n   networks), for
      example, the role a device plays is often fixed and\n   based on its location.
      \ Using manual address configuration is\n   possible (and is common), but it
      would be beneficial if DHCP\n   configuration could be applied to these networks.\n
      \  One way to provide connection-based identifiers for industrial\n   networks
      is to have the network elements acting as DHCP relay agents\n   supply information
      that a DHCP server could use as a client\n   identifier.  A straightforward
      way to form identifier information is\n   to combine something that is unique
      within the scope of the network\n   element, such as a port/slot value, with
      something that uniquely\n   identifies that network element, such as a Relay
      Agent Identifier.\n"

  - "5.  Identifier Stability\n   If the relay identifier is to be meaningful, it
    has to be stable.  A\n   relay agent SHOULD use a single identifier value consistently.
    \ The\n   identifier used by a relay device SHOULD be committed to stable\n   storage,
    unless the relay device can regenerate the value upon\n   reboot.\n   If the Relay-ID
    configured in a relay agent is not unique within its\n   administrative domain,
    resource allocation problems may occur as the\n   DHCP server attempts to allocate
    the same resource to devices behind\n   two different relay agents.  Therefore,
    a Relay-ID configured in a\n   relay agent MUST be unique within its administrative
    domain.  To aid\n   in ensuring uniqueness of Relay-IDs, relay agents SHOULD make
    their\n   relay identifiers visible to their administrators via their user\n   interface,
    through a log entry, through a MIB field, or through some\n   other mechanism.\n
    \  Implementors of relay agents should note that the identifier needs to\n   be
    present in all DHCP message types where its value is being used by\n   the DHCP
    server.  The relay agent may not be able to add the Relay\n   Agent Information
    option to all messages, such as RENEW messages sent\n   as IP unicasts.  In some
    deployments, that might mean that the server\n   has to be willing to continue
    to associate the relay identifier it\n   has last seen with a lease that is being
    RENEWed.  Other deployments\n   may prefer to use the Server Identifier Override
    sub-option [RFC5107]\n   to permit the relay device to insert the Relay Agent
    Information\n   option into all relayed messages.\n   Handling situations where
    a relay agent device is replaced is another\n   aspect of stability.  One of the
    use cases for the relay identifier\n   is to permit a server to associate clients'
    lease bindings with the\n   relay device connected to the clients.  If the relay
    device is\n   replaced because it has failed or been upgraded, it may be desirable\n
    \  for the new device to continue to provide the same relay identifier\n   as
    the old device.  Therefore, if a relay agent supports Relay-ID,\n   the Relay-ID
    should be administratively configurable.\n"

    - "5.1.  Identifier Uniqueness\n   It is strongly recommended that administrators
      take special care to\n   ensure that Relay-IDs configured in their relay agents
      are not\n   duplicated.  There are a number of strategies that may be used to\n
      \  achieve this.\n   Administrators may use a strategy to configure unique Relay-IDs.
      \ One\n   such strategy is that a Relay-ID on a relay agent may reuse an\n   existing
      identifier or set of identifiers that are already guaranteed\n   to be unique
      (e.g., Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) [RFC4122]).\n   For administrators
      who are already using a provisioning system to\n   manage their networking infrastructure,
      it may work to enumerate\n   relay agents on the basis of roles and then, as
      a second step, assign\n   those roles to specific relay agents or groups of
      relay agents.  In\n   such a scenario, when a replacement relay agent is first
      seen by the\n   DHCP server, it could trigger a configuration event on the\n
      \  provisioning system, and the new relay agent could be assigned to the\n   role
      of the relay agent it is replacing.\n   It may be that the DHCP server has configurable
      event notification\n   and that a duplicate Relay-ID would trigger this notification.\n
      \  Administrators can take advantage of this feature to work out whether\n   the
      duplication is real and unintended or whether the original relay\n   agent is
      being replaced.\n   A network management/provisioning system may also be able
      to collect\n   a full list of all relay agents on the network.  It may then
      notice\n   that more than one device reports the same Relay-ID.  In such a case,\n
      \  the provisioning system could notify the administrator of the fault,\n   which
      could then be corrected.\n   This is not an exhaustive list of strategies.  We
      suggest an\n   additional strategy in the Security Considerations section.  If
      none\n   of these strategies will work, administrators are also encouraged to\n
      \  consider the specifics of their own network configuration to see if\n   there
      is some way to detect duplicate Relay-IDs other than the ones\n   listed here.\n"

    - "6.1.  Forged Relay ID Attacks\n   Security issues with the Relay Agent Information
      option and its use\n   by servers in address assignment are discussed in [RFC3046]
      and\n   [RFC4030].  The DHCP Relay Agent Information option depends on a\n   trusted
      relationship between the DHCP relay agent and the DHCP\n   server, as described
      in Section 5 of [RFC3046].  While the\n   introduction of fraudulent DHCP Relay
      Agent Information options can\n   be prevented by a perimeter defense that blocks
      these options unless\n   the DHCP relay agent is trusted, a deeper defense using
      the\n   authentication sub-option for the DHCP Relay Agent Information option\n
      \  [RFC4030] SHOULD be deployed as well.  It also helps in avoiding\n   duplication
      of relay identifiers by malicious entities.  However,\n   implementation of
      the authentication sub-option for the DHCP Relay\n   Agent Information option
      [RFC4030] is not a must to support the\n   Relay-ID sub-option.\n"

    - "6.2.  Factory-Floor Scenario\n   One possible use case for the Relay-ID sub-option
      is the automated\n   configuration of machines on a factory floor.  In this
      situation,\n   various sections of the factory floor might be on their own network\n
      \  links with a relay agent interposed between those links and the DHCP\n   server.
      \ The Relay-ID of each relay agent might cause special\n   configurations to
      be downloaded to those devices to control their\n   behavior.\n   If a relay
      agent was deployed on the factory floor in such a\n   situation, with an incorrect
      Relay-ID, there is the potential that\n   devices could be misconfigured in
      a way that could produce incorrect\n   results, cause physical damage, or even
      create hazardous conditions\n   for workers.\n   In deployment scenarios like
      this one, administrators must use some\n   dependable technique to ensure that
      such misconfigurations do not\n   occur.  It is beyond the scope of this document
      to provide a complete\n   list of such techniques.\n   However, as an example,
      a relay agent device intended for use in such\n   a scenario could require the
      use of a hardware token that contains a\n   Relay-ID that is physically attached
      to the installation location of\n   the relay agent device and can be connected
      to and disconnected from\n   the relay agent device without the use of special
      tools.  Such a\n   relay agent device should not be operable when this hardware
      token is\n   not connected to it: either it should fail because it presents
      an\n   unknown identifier to the DHCP server, or it should simply refuse to\n
      \  relay DHCP packets until the token is connected to it.\n   A relay agent
      device that does not provide a clear mitigation\n   strategy for a scenario
      where misconfiguration could have damaging or\n   hazardous consequences should
      not be deployed in such a scenario.\n"
