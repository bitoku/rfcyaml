    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"

  - "3.  Short Overview of Fibre Channel\n   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a
    bidirectional point-to-point\n   serial data channel, structured for high performance.
    \ Fibre Channel\n   provides a general transport vehicle for higher-level protocols
    such\n   as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-\n   Performance
    Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet\n   Protocol), IEEE 802.2,
    and others.\n   Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple\n
    \  communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either by a\n   switching
    network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A\n   Fibre Channel \"node\"
    consists of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may\n   consist of multiple Interconnect
    Elements, some of which are\n   switches.  An N_Port connects to the Fabric via
    a port on a switch\n   called an F_Port.  When multiple FC nodes are connected
    to a single\n   port on a switch via an \"Arbitrated Loop\" topology, the switch
    port\n   is called an FL_Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL_Ports.  The\n
    \  term Nx_Port is used to refer to either an N_Port or an NL_Port.  The\n   term
    Fx_Port is used to refer to either an F_Port or an FL_Port.  A\n   switch port,
    which is interconnected to another switch port via an\n   Inter-Switch Link (ISL),
    is called an E_Port.  A B_Port connects a\n   bridge device with an E_Port on
    a switch; a B_Port provides a subset\n   of E_Port functionality.\n   Many Fibre
    Channel components, including the Fabric, each node, and\n   most ports, have
    globally unique names.  These globally unique names\n   are typically formatted
    as World Wide Names (WWNs).  More information\n   on WWNs can be found in [FC-FS].
    \ WWNs are expected to be persistent\n   across agent and unit resets.\n   Fibre
    Channel frames contain 24-bit address identifiers that identify\n   the frame's
    source and destination ports.  Each FC port has both an\n   address identifier
    and a WWN.  When a Fabric is in use, the FC\n   address identifiers are dynamic
    and are assigned by a switch.  Each\n   octet of a 24-bit address represents a
    level in an address hierarchy,\n   with a Domain_ID being the highest level of
    the hierarchy.\n   The Fibre Channel Fabric Configuration Server provides a way
    for a\n   management application to discover Fibre Channel fabric topology and\n
    \  attributes.  The Fabric Configuration Server is designed so that it\n   can
    be distributed among switches and accessed from any Nx_Port.\n   However, the
    Fabric Configuration Server is not restricted or\n   required to be part of/within
    a Fabric.\n   The information registered with and available from each Fabric\n
    \  Configuration Server is modeled as a Fabric consisting of one or more\n   Interconnect
    Elements that each have some number of physical Ports,\n   and one or more Fibre
    Channel nodes grouped together into Platforms\n   to facilitate discovery and
    management.  The Ports are connected\n   either to other Ports on other Interconnect
    Elements, or to Nx_Ports.\n   Each Interconnect Element may have attributes including
    its name,\n   type, Domain Identifier, Management Identifier, Logical Name,\n
    \  Management Address(es), Information List, Zoning Enforcement Status,\n   etc.
    \ Each Port may have attributes including its name, type, TX\n   type, Module
    type, physical port number, attached port name(s), port\n   state, speed, etc.
    \ Each platform may have attributes including its\n   name, type, description,
    label, location, management address, etc.\n   The Fibre Channel Fabric Configuration
    Server is defined in the FC-GS\n   specification.  The Fabric Configuration Server
    is one of a set of\n   functions that are collectively known as the Management
    Service.  The\n   latest version of the specification is [FC-GS-5].\n   The latest
    standard for an interconnecting Fabric containing multiple\n   Fabric Switch elements
    is [FC-SW-4].  [FC-SW-4] carries forward the\n   earlier specification for the
    operation of a single Fabric in a\n   physical infrastructure, and augments it
    with the definition of\n   Virtual Fabrics and with the specification of how multiple
    Virtual\n   Fabrics can operate within one (or more) physical infrastructures.\n
    \  The use of Virtual Fabrics provides for each frame to be tagged in\n   its
    header to indicate which one of several Virtual Fabrics that\n   frame is being
    transmitted on.  All frames entering a particular\n   \"Core Switch\" [FC-SW-4]
    (i.e., a physical switch) on the same Virtual\n   Fabric are processed by the
    same \"Virtual Switch\" within that Core\n   Switch.\n"

  - "4.  Relationship to Other MIBs\n   The first standardized MIB for Fibre Channel
    [RFC2837] was focused on\n   Fibre Channel switches.  It has been replaced by
    the more generic\n   Fibre Channel Management MIB [RFC4044], which defines basic\n
    \  information for Fibre Channel hosts and switches, including\n   extensions
    to the standard IF-MIB for Fibre Channel interfaces.\n   This MIB extends beyond
    [RFC4044] to cover the functionality, in\n   Fibre Channel switches, of providing
    Fibre Channel's Fabric\n   Configuration Server function.\n   This MIB imports
    some common Textual Conventions from T11-TC-MIB\n   [RFC4439] and from T11-FC-NAME-SERVER-MIB
    [RFC4438].  It also imports\n   URLString from NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB [RFC2788].\n"
  title: 4.  Relationship to Other MIBs
- contents:
  - "5.  MIB Overview\n   This MIB module provides the means for monitoring the operation
    of,\n   and configuring some parameters of, one or more Fabric Configuration\n
    \  Servers (FCS) in a Fibre Channel (FC) network.  The capabilities\n   provided
    include triggering a discovery of the configuration of one\n   or more Fabrics,
    retrieving the results of such a discovery, as well\n   as controlling and monitoring
    the operation of an FCS.  The\n   discovered configuration contains information
    about:\n   - Interconnect Elements (IEs), i.e., switches, hubs, bridges, etc.,\n
    \  - Ports on IEs, and\n   - Platforms that consist of one or more FC nodes.\n"
  - contents:
    - "5.1.  Fibre Channel Management Instance\n   A Fibre Channel management instance
      is defined in [RFC4044] as a\n   separable managed instance of Fibre Channel
      functionality.  Fibre\n   Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel
      management\n   instances in whatever way is most convenient for the\n   implementation(s).
      \ For example, one such grouping accommodates a\n   single SNMP agent having
      multiple AgentX [RFC2741] sub-agents, with\n   each sub-agent implementing a
      different Fibre Channel management\n   instance.\n   The object, fcmInstanceIndex,
      is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB\n   [RFC4044] as the index value to uniquely
      identify each Fibre Channel\n   management instance, for example, within the
      same SNMP context\n   ([RFC3411], section 3.3.1).\n"
    title: 5.1.  Fibre Channel Management Instance
  - contents:
    - "5.2.  Switch Index\n   The FC-MGMT-MIB [RFC4044] defines the fcmSwitchTable
      as a table of\n   information about Fibre Channel switches that are managed
      by Fibre\n   Channel management instances.  Each Fibre Channel management instance\n
      \  can manage one or more Fibre Channel switches.  The Switch Index,\n   fcmSwitchIndex,
      is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB as the index value\n   to uniquely identify
      a Fibre Channel switch amongst those (one or\n   more) managed by the same Fibre
      Channel management instance.\n"
    title: 5.2.  Switch Index
  - contents:
    - "5.3.  Fabric Index\n   With multiple Fabrics, each Fabric has its own instances
      of the\n   Fabric-related management instrumentation.  Thus, this MIB defines\n
      \  all Fabric-related information in tables that are INDEXed by an\n   arbitrary
      integer, named a \"Fabric Index\".  The syntax of a Fabric\n   Index is T11FabricIndex,
      imported from T11-TC-MIB [RFC4439].  When a\n   device is connected to a single
      physical Fabric, without use of any\n   virtual Fabrics, the value of this Fabric
      Index will always be 1.  In\n   an environment of multiple virtual and/or physical
      Fabrics, this\n   index provides a means to distinguish one Fabric from another.\n
      \  It is quite possible, and may even be likely, that a Fibre Channel\n   switch
      will have ports connected to multiple virtual and/or physical\n   Fabrics.  Thus,
      in order to simplify a management protocol query\n   concerning all the Fabrics
      to which a single switch is connected,\n   fcmSwitchIndex will be listed before
      t11FcsFabricIndex when they both\n   appear in the same INDEX clause.\n"

        request;\n   - completes discovery on a range of Fabrics;\n   - learns that
        a management address of an Interconnect Element has\n     changed.\n"
      - contents:
        - "5.4.5.1. Flow Control for Notifications\n   When defining SNMP notifications
          for events that occur in the data-\n   plane, the maximum frequency of their
          generation needs to be\n   considered.  Unless there is some limiting factor,
          such notifications\n   need to be flow-controlled in some way, e.g., defined
          such that after\n   some maximum number within a specified time interval
          have occurred,\n   further notifications are suppressed for some subsequent
          time\n   interval.  However, as and when such a suppression occurs, the\n
          \  Network Management System (NMS) that didn't receive the notifications\n
          \  (because they were suppressed) needs to be able to obtain an\n   indication
          of how many were suppressed.  Therefore, an additional\n   Counter32 object
          needs to be defined, and/or a new type of\n   notification needs to be defined
          for use at the end of the interval.\n   While this is extra complexity,
          it is necessary for notifications\n   that need to be flow-controlled.\n
          \  In contrast, for notifications such as all the ones defined in this\n
          \  MIB module, which are generated due to control-plane events (and are\n
          \  not able to start a chain reaction):\n   - estimating the maximum number
          that could possibly be generated per\n     unit time for each type of notification
          is too simplistic.  For\n     example, it's unreasonable to ask how many
          of the\n     t11FcsDiscoveryCompleteNotify notifications can be generated
          in a\n     time interval, because it depends on several factors: how big
          is\n     the network? how many Virtual Fabrics need to be discovered? how\n
          \    quickly can the operator ask for another discovery after the last\n
          \    one completes?\n   - the extra complexity of flow-controlling these
          types of\n     notifications is not warranted.\n"

    -- the ability to specify parameters\n                                    for,
    and trigger the start of,\n                                    a topology discovery.\n
    \     t11FcsDiscoveryStatus      -- the ability to abort a discovery, or\n                                    invalidate
    discovered information.\n      t11FcsReqRejectNotifyEnable\n      t11FcsDiscoveryCompNotifyEnable\n
    \     t11FcsMgmtAddrChangeNotifyEnable -- the ability to enable/disable\n                                          notifications.\n
    \  Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some\n   network
    environments.  For example, the ability to invalidate\n   discovered topology
    may afford an attacker the ability to hide the\n   presence of unauthorized equipment
    on the network.  The support for\n   SET operations in a non-secure environment
    without proper protection\n   can have a negative effect on network operations.\n
    \  Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS
    other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some
    network environments.  It is thus important to\n   control even GET and/or NOTIFY
    access to these objects and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of these objects
    when sending them over\n   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects
    and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n      t11FcsIeTable\n      t11FcsMgmtAddrListTable\n
    \     t11FcsPortTable\n      t11FcsAttachPortNameListTable\n      t11FcsPlatformTable\n
    \     t11FcsNodeNameListTable -- contains information about the topology\n                                 of
    the Fibre Channel network.\n      t11FcsStatsTable -- contains statistics information
    about the\n                          operation of the Fabric Configuration Server.\n
    \  SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if
    the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n   even then, there
    is no control as to who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET
    (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED
    that implementors consider the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3
    framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3
    cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment
    of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED
    to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n
    \  responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance
    of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only
    to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET
    (change/create/delete) them.\n"
