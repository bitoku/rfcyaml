- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) specification\n\
    \   ([ISO], [RFC1195]) allows for authentication of its Protocol Data\n   Units\
    \ (PDUs) via the authentication TLV 10 that is carried as a part\n   of the PDU.\
    \  The base specification has provision for only cleartext\n   passwords and RFC\
    \ 5304 [RFC5304] augments this to provide the\n   capability to use Hashed Message\
    \ Authentication Code - Message Digest\n   5 (HMAC-MD5) authentication for its\
    \ PDUs.\n   The first octet of the value field of TLV 10 specifies the type of\n\
    \   authentication to be carried out.  Type 0 is reserved, Type 1\n   indicates\
    \ a cleartext password, Type 54 indicates HMAC MD5, and Type\n   255 is used for\
    \ routing domain private authentication methods.  The\n   remainder of the value\
    \ field contains the actual authentication data,\n   determined by the value of\
    \ the authentication type.\n   This document proposes a new authentication type\
    \ to be carried in TLV\n   10, called the generic cryptographic authentication\
    \ (CRYPTO_AUTH).\n   This can be used to specify any authentication algorithm\
    \ for\n   authenticating and verifying IS-IS PDUs.\n   This document also explains\
    \ how HMAC-SHA authentication can be used\n   in IS-IS.\n   By definition, HMAC\
    \ ([RFC2104], [FIPS-198]) requires a cryptographic\n   hash function.  We propose\
    \ to use any one of SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256,\n   SHA-384, or SHA-512 [FIPS-180-3]\
    \ to authenticate the IS-IS PDUs.\n   We propose to do away with the per-interface\
    \ keys and instead have\n   Key IDs that map to unique IS-IS Security Associations\
    \ (SAs).\n   While at the time of this writing there are no openly published\n\
    \   attacks on the HMAC-MD5 mechanism, some reports ([Dobb96a],\n   [Dobb96b])\
    \ create concern about the ultimate strength of the MD5\n   cryptographic hash\
    \ function.\n   The mechanism described in this document does not provide\n  \
    \ confidentiality, since PDUs are sent in the clear.  However, the\n   objective\
    \ of a routing protocol is to advertise the routing topology,\n   and confidentiality\
    \ is not normally required for routing protocols.\n"

- title: 2.  IS-IS Security Association
  contents:
  - "2.  IS-IS Security Association\n   An IS-IS Security Association contains a set\
    \ of parameters shared\n   between any two legitimate IS-IS speakers.\n   Parameters\
    \ associated with an IS-IS SA:\n   o  Key Identifier (Key ID): This is a two-octet\
    \ unsigned integer used\n      to uniquely identify an IS-IS SA, as manually configured\
    \ by the\n      network operator.\n      The receiver determines the active SA\
    \ by looking at the Key ID\n      field in the incoming PDU.\n      The sender,\
    \ based on the active configuration, selects the\n      Security Association to\
    \ use and puts the correct Key ID value\n      associated with the Security Association\
    \ in the IS-IS PDU.  If\n      multiple valid and active IS-IS Security Associations\
    \ exist for a\n      given outbound interface at the time an IS-IS PDU is sent,\
    \ the\n      sender may use any of those Security Associations to protect the\n\
    \      packet.\n      Using Key IDs makes changing keys while maintaining protocol\n\
    \      operation convenient.  Each Key ID specifies two independent\n      parts:\
    \ the authentication protocol and the authentication key,\n      explained below.\
    \  Normally, an implementation would allow the\n      network operator to configure\
    \ a set of keys in a key chain, with\n      each key in the chain having a fixed\
    \ lifetime.  The actual\n      operation of these mechanisms is outside the scope\
    \ of this\n      document.\n      Note that each Key ID can indicate a key with\
    \ a different\n      authentication protocol.  This allows multiple authentication\n\
    \      mechanisms to be used at various times without disrupting an IS-IS\n  \
    \    peering, including the introduction of new authentication\n      mechanisms.\n\
    \   o  Authentication Algorithm: This signifies the authentication\n      algorithm\
    \ to be used with the IS-IS SA.  This information is never\n      sent in cleartext\
    \ over the wire.  Because this information is not\n      sent on the wire, the\
    \ implementer chooses an implementation-\n      specific representation for this\
    \ information.  At present, the\n      following values are possible: HMAC-SHA-1,\
    \ HMAC-SHA-224, HMAC-SHA-\n      256, HMAC-SHA-384, and HMAC-SHA-512.\n   o  Authentication\
    \ Key: This value denotes the cryptographic\n      authentication key associated\
    \ with the IS-IS SA.  The length of\n      this key is variable and depends upon\
    \ the authentication algorithm\n      specified by the IS-IS SA.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.3.  Cryptographic Aspects\n   In the algorithm description below, the following\
    \ nomenclature, which\n   is consistent with [FIPS-198] is used:\n    H    is\
    \ the specific hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256).\n    K    is the password for\
    \ the PDU type as per the International\n         Standard ISO/IEC 10589 [ISO].\n\
    \    Ko   is the cryptographic key used with the hash algorithm.\n    B    is\
    \ the block size of H, measured in octets rather than bits.\n         Note that\
    \ B is the internal block size, not the hash size.\n              For SHA-1 and\
    \ SHA-256:   B == 64\n              For SHA-384 and SHA-512: B == 128\n    L \
    \   is the length of the hash, measured in octets rather than bits.\n    XOR \
    \ is the exclusive-or operation.\n    Opad is the hexadecimal value 0x5c repeated\
    \ B times.\n    Ipad is the hexadecimal value 0x36 repeated B times.\n    Apad\
    \ is the hexadecimal value 0x878FE1F3 repeated (L/4) times.\n   (1)  Preparation\
    \ of the Key\n        In this application, Ko is always L octets long.\n     \
    \   If the Authentication Key (K) is L octets long, then Ko is equal\n       \
    \ to K.  If the Authentication Key (K) is more than L octets long,\n        then\
    \ Ko is set to H(K).  If the Authentication Key (K) is less\n        than L octets\
    \ long, then Ko is set to the Authentication Key (K)\n        with zeros appended\
    \ to the end of the Authentication Key (K)\n        such that Ko is L octets long.\n\
    \   (2)  First Hash\n        First, the IS-IS packet's Authentication Data field\
    \ is filled\n        with the value Apad, and the Authentication Type field is\
    \ set to\n        0x3.\n        Then, a first hash, also known as the inner hash,\

    \ = H(Ko XOR Opad || First-Hash)\n   (4)  Result\n        The resulting second\
    \ hash becomes the authentication data that\n        is sent in the Authentication\
    \ Data field of the IS-IS PDU.  The\n        length of the Authentication Data\
    \ field is always identical to\n        the message digest size of the specific\
    \ hash function H that is\n        being used.\n        This also means that the\
    \ use of hash functions with larger\n        output sizes will also increase the\
    \ size of the IS-IS PDU as\n        transmitted on the wire.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.4.  Procedures at the Sending Side\n   An appropriate IS-IS SA is selected\
    \ for use with an outgoing IS-IS\n   PDU.  This is done based on the active key\
    \ at that instant.  If IS-IS\n   is unable to find an active key, then the PDU\
    \ is discarded.\n   If IS-IS is able to find the active key, then the key provides\
    \ the\n   authentication algorithm (HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-224, HMAC-SHA-256,\n\
    \   HMAC-SHA-384, or HMAC-SHA-512) that needs to be applied on the PDU.\n   An\
    \ implementation MUST fill the authentication type and the length\n   before the\
    \ authentication data is computed.  The authentication data\n   is computed as\
    \ explained in the previous section.  The length of the\n   TLV is set as per\
    \ the authentication algorithm that is being used.\n   The length is set to 23\

  - "3.5.  Procedure at the Receiving Side\n   The appropriate IS-IS SA is identified\
    \ by looking at the Key ID from\n   the Authentication TLV 10 from the incoming\
    \ IS-IS PDU.\n   Authentication-algorithm-dependent processing needs to be performed,\n\
    \   using the algorithm specified by the appropriate IS-IS SA for the\n   received\

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document proposes extensions to IS-IS that\
    \ make it more secure\n   than what it is today.  It does not provide confidentiality\
    \ as a\n   routing protocol contains information that does not need to be kept\n\
    \   secret.  It does, however, provide means to authenticate the sender\n   of\
    \ the PDUs, which is of interest to us.\n   It should be noted that authentication\
    \ method described in this\n   document is not being used to authenticate the\
    \ specific originator of\n   a PDU, but is rather being used to confirm that the\
    \ PDU has indeed\n   been issued by an intermediate system that had access to\
    \ either the\n   area or domain password, depending upon the kind of PDU it is.\n\
    \   The mechanism described here is not perfect and does not need to be\n   perfect.\
    \  Instead, this mechanism represents a significant increase\n   in the work function\
    \ of an adversary attacking the IS-IS protocol,\n   while not causing undue implementation,\
    \ deployment, or operational\n   complexity.\n   The mechanism detailed in this\
    \ document does not protect IS-IS\n   against replay attacks.  An adversary could\
    \ in theory replay old IIHs\n   and bring down the adjacency [CRYPTO] or replay\
    \ old Complete Sequence\n   Number PDUs (CSNPs) and Partial Sequence Number PDUs\
    \ (PSNPs) that\n   would cause a flood of LSPs in the network.  Using some sort\
    \ of\n   crypto sequence numbers in IS-IS IIHs and CSNP/PSNPs is an option to\n\
    \   solve this problem.  Discussing this is beyond the scope of this\n   document.\n\
    \   This document states that the remaining lifetime of the LSP MUST be\n   set\
    \ to zero before computing the authentication, thus this field is\n   not authenticated.\
    \  This field is excluded so that the LSPs may be\n   aged by the ISes in between,\
    \ without requiring re-computation of the\n   authentication data.  This can be\
    \ exploited by an attacker.\n   There is a transition mode suggested where routers\
    \ can ignore the\n   CRYPTO_AUTH information carried in the PDUs.  The operator\
    \ must\n   ensure that this mode is only used when migrating to the new\n   CRYPTO_AUTH-based\
    \ authentication scheme, as this leaves the router\n   vulnerable to an attack.\n\
    \   To ensure greater security, the keys used should be changed\n   periodically,\
    \ and implementations MUST be able to store and use more\n   than one key at the\
    \ same time.  Operators should ensure that the\n   authentication key is never\
    \ sent over the network in cleartext via\n   any protocol.  Care should also be\
    \ taken to ensure that the selected\n   key is unpredictable, avoiding any keys\
    \ known to be weak for the\n   algorithm in use.  [RFC4086] contains helpful information\
    \ on both key\n   generation techniques and cryptographic randomness.\n   It should\
    \ be noted that the cryptographic strength of the HMAC\n   depends upon the cryptographic\
    \ strength of the underlying hash\n   function and on the size and quality of\
    \ the key.\n   If a stronger authentication were believed to be required, then\
    \ the\n   use of a full digital signature [RFC2154] would be an approach that\n\
    \   should be seriously considered.  It was rejected for this purpose at\n   this\
    \ time because the computational burden of full digital signatures\n   is believed\
    \ to be much higher than is reasonable given the current\n   threat environment\
    \ in operational commercial networks.\n"
