PPP [RFC 1661] provides a standard method for transporting multi protocol packets over point to point links.
As currently specified, Mobile IP Foreign Agents which support Mobile Node connections via PPP can do so only by first assigning unique addresses to those Mobile Nodes, defeating one of the primary advantages of Foreign Agents.
This documents corrects this problem by defining the Mobile IPv4 Configuration Option to the Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP)
Using this option, two peers can communicate their support for Mobile IP during the IPCP phase of PPP.
Familiarity with Mobile IP [RFC 2002], IPCP [RFC 1332], and PPP [RFC 1661] is assumed.

Using a Dedicated AS for Sites
Homed to a Single Provider With the increased growth of the Internet, the number of customers using BGP4 has grown significantly.
RFC1930 outlines a set of guidelines for when one needs and should use an AS.
However, the customer and service provider (ISP) are left with a problem as a result of this in that while there is no need for an allocated AS under the guidelines, certain conditions make the use of BGP4 a very pragmatic and perhaps only way to connect a customer homed to a single ISP.
This paper proposes a solution to this problem in line with recommendations set forth in RFC1930.

Use of DNS Aliases for Network Services
It has become a common practice to use symbolic names (usually CNAMEs) in the Domain Name Service (DNS [RFC 1034, RFC 1035]) to refer to network services such as anonymous FTP [RFC 959] servers, Gopher [RFC  1436] servers, and most notably World Wide Web HTTP
This is desirable for a number of reasons.
It provides a way of moving services from one machine to another transparently, and a mechanism by which people or agents may programmatically discover that an organization runs, say, a World Wide Web server.
Although this approach has been almost universally adopted, there is no standards document or similar specification for these commonly used names.
This document seeks to rectify this situation by gathering together the extant 'folklore' on naming conventions, and proposes a mechanism for accommodating new protocols.
