Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes objects used for managing multicast function, independent of the specific multicast protocol(s) in use.
This document obsoletes RFC 2932.
This MIB describes objects used for managing IP multicast function, including IP multicast routing.
These objects are independent of the specific multicast routing protocol in use.
Managed objects specific to particular multicast protocols are defined elsewhere.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
The MIB module defined by this document is a re working of the MIB module from [RFC2932], with changes that include the following:
This MIB module includes support for IPv6 addressing and the IPv6 scoped address architecture.
This MIB module allows several multicast protocols to perform routing on a single interface, where [RFC2932] assumed each interface supported at most one multicast routing protocol.
Multicast routing protocols are now per route, see ipMcastRouteProtocol.
This MIB module includes objects that are not specific to multicast routing.
It allows management of multicast function on systems that do not perform routing, whereas [RFC2932] was restricted to multicast routing.
This MIB module includes a table of Source Specific Multicast (SSM) address ranges to which SSM semantics [RFC3569] should be applied.
This MIB module includes a table of local applications that are receiving multicast data.
This MIB module includes a table of multicast scope zones.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, ([RFC2578], [RFC2579] and [RFC2580]).
This MIB module contains two scalars and eight tables.
The IP Multicast Interface Table, which contains multicast information specific to interfaces.
The IP Multicast SSM Range Table, which contains one row per range of multicast group addresses to which Source Specific Multicast semantics [RFC3569] should be applied.
The IP Multicast Route Table, which contains multicast routing information for IP datagrams sent by particular sources to the IP multicast groups known to a system.
The IP Multicast Routing Next Hop Table, which contains information about next hops for the routing of IP multicast datagrams.
Each entry is one of a list of next hops on outgoing interfaces for particular sources sending to a particular multicast group address.
The IP Multicast Scope Boundary Table, which contains the boundaries configured for multicast scopes [RFC2365].
The IP Multicast Scope Name Table, which contains human readable names for multicast scopes.
The IP Multicast Local Listener Table, which contains identifiers for local applications that are receiving multicast data.
The IP Multicast Zone Table, which contains an entry for each scope zone known to a system, and maps each zone to the multicast address range that is the corresponding scope.
This MIB module uses textual conventions defined in the IF MIB [RFC2863], the INET ADDRESS MIB [RFC4001] and the IANA RTPROTO MIB.
MIB Modules and REFERENCE Clauses
The MIB modules defined in this document IMPORTs definitions normatively from the following MIB modules, beyond [RFC2578], [RFC2579], and [RFC2580]: HCNUM TC [RFC2856], IF MIB [RFC2863], IANA  RTPROTO MIB, SNMP FRAMEWORK MIB [RFC3411], INET ADDRESS MIB [RFC4001], and LANGTAG TC MIB [RFC5131].
This MIB module also includes REFERENCE clauses that make normative references to Administratively Scoped IP Multicast [RFC2365], Unicast Prefix based IPv6
Multicast Addresses [RFC3306], IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture [RFC4007], and IPv6 Addressing Architecture [RFC4291].
Finally, this MIB module makes informative references to several RFCs in the text of DESCRIPTION clauses, including sysApplMIB
[RFC2287], IP MIB [RFC4293], Source Specific Multicast [RFC3569], Protocol Independent Multicast Sparse Mode version 2 (PIM SMv2)
Protocol Specification [RFC4601], Bidirectional Protocol Independent Multicast (BIDIR PIM) [RFC5015], and Tags for Identifying Languages [RFC4646].

For addresses of type ipv4z or ipv6z, the appended zone index is significant even though it lies beyond the prefix length.
The use of these address types indicate that this SSM range entry applies only within the given zone.
Zone index zero is not valid in this table.
If non global scope SSM range entries are present, then consistent ipMcastBoundaryTable entries are required on routers at the zone boundary."

SNMPv3 SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to access (read/change/create/delete) them.
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
This section discusses and lists these elements.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
In this MIB module, possible effects that can be induced by SET operations on writeable objects include:  Modifications to multicast routing behavior that prevent or disrupt services provided by the network, including (but not limited to) multicast data traffic delivery.
Modifications to multicast routing behavior that allow interception or subversion of information that is carried by the network.
For example, attacks can be envisaged that would pass nominated multicast data streams through a nominated location, without the sources or listeners becoming aware of this subversion.
The following are the read write and read create objects defined in this MIB module.
ipMcastScopeNameString ipMcastScopeNameDefault ipMcastScopeNameStatus ipMcastScopeNameStorageType 7.3.
As well as the writeable objects discussed above, there are a number of readable objects (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not  accessible) that may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
In this MIB module, possible effects that can be induced by GET and/or NOTIFY operations include:  Determination of the topology, disposition, and composition of the network.
This information may be commercially sensitive, and may also be used in preparation for attacks, including any of the attacks described above.
Determinion of whether multicast data is flowing in the network, or has flowed recently, as well as the locations of senders and recipients.
An attacker can apply 'traffic analysis' to this data.
In some cases, the information revealed by traffic analyses can be as damaging as full knowledge of the data being transported.
IANA Considerations IPMCAST MIB is rooted under the mib 2 subtree.
IANA has assigned { mib 2 168 } to the IPMCAST MIB module specified in this document.
