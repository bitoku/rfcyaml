    \ Address Hierarchy\n   An O/R Address hierarchy is represented in the X.500 directory\
    \ by\n   associating directory name components with O/R Address components.\n\
    \   An example of this is given in Figure 1.  The object classes and\n   attributes\
    \ required to support this representation are defined in\n   Figure 2.  The schema,\
    \ which defines the hierarchy in which these\n   objects are represented in the\
    \ directory information tree is\n   specified in Table 1.  A given object class\
    \ defined in the table will\n   always be higher in the DIT than an object class\
    \ defined lower down\n   the table.  Valid combinations of O/R Address components\
    \ are defined\n   in X.400.\n                                  /\\\n         \

    \                    Figure 2:  O/R Address Hierarchy\n   The hierarchy is defined\
    \ so that:\n   1.  The representation is defined so that it is straightforward\
    \ to\n       make a mechanical transformation in either direction.  This\n   \
    \    requires that each node is named by an attribute whose type can\n       determine\
    \ the mapping.\n   2.  Where there are multiple domain defined attributes, the\
    \ first\n       in the sequence is the most significant.\n   3.  Physical Delivery\
    \ (postal) addresses are not represented in\n       this hierarchy.  This is primarily\
    \ because physical delivery can\n       be handled by the Access Unit routing\
    \ mechanisms defined in [4],\n       and there is no need for this representation.\n\
    \   4.  Terminal and network forms of address are not handled, except\n      \
    \ for X.121 form, which is useful for addressing faxes.\n   5.  MHSCountry is\
    \ defined as a subclass of Country, and so the\n       same entry will be used\
    \ for MHS Routing as for the rest of the\n       DIT.\n   6.  The numeric country\
    \ code will be an alias.\n   7.  ADMD will always be present in the hierarchy.\
    \  This is true\n       in the case of \" \" and of \"0\".  This facilitates an\
    \ easy\n       mechanical transformation between the two forms of address.\n \
    \  8.  Each node is named by the relevant part of the O/R Address.\n   9.  Aliases\
    \ may be used in other parts of the tree, in order to\n       normalize alternate\
    \ values.  Where an alias is used, the value of\n       the alias should be present\
    \ as an alternate value in the node\n       aliased to.  Aliases may not be used\
    \ for domain defined\n       attributes.\n   10. Domain Defined Attributes are\
    \ named by a multi-valued RDN\n       (Relative Distinguished Name), consisting\
    \ of the type and value.\n       This is done so that standard attribute syntaxes\
    \ can be used.\n   11. Where an O/R Address has a valid Printable String and T.61\
    \ form,\n       both must be present, with one as an alias for the other.  This\n\
    \       is so that direct lookup of the name will work, independent of\n     \
    \  the variant used.  When both are present in an O/R Address being\n       looked\
    \ up, either may be used to construct the distinguished\n       name.\n   12.\
    \ Personal name is handled by use of the mHSPerson object class.\n       Each\
    \ of the components of the personal name will be present in\n       the relative\
    \ distinguished name, which will usually be multi-\n       valued.\n   The relationship\
    \ between X.400 O/R Addresses and the X.400 Entries\n   (Attribute Type and Object\
    \ Class) are given in Table 2.  Where there\n   are multiple Organizational Units\
    \ or Domain Defined Attributes, each\n   component is mapped onto a single X.500\
    \ entry.\n   Note: When an X.121 address is used for addressing fax transmission,\n\
    \       this may only be done relative to the PRMD or ADMD. This is in\n     \
    \  line with the current X.400 standards position.  This means that\n       it\
    \ is not possible to use this form of addressing for an\n       organizational\
    \ or departmental fax gateway service.\nO/R Address  Object Class            \

    \ from O/R Address to Directory Name\n   The primary application of this mapping\
    \ is to take an X.400 encoded\n   O/R Address and to generate an equivalent directory\
    \ name.  This\n   mapping is only used for selected types of O/R Address:\n  \
    \  o  Mnemonic form\n    o  Numeric form\n    o  Terminal form, where country\
    \ is present and X121 addressing\n       is used\n   Other forms of O/R address\
    \ are handled by Access Unit mechanisms.\n   The O/R Address is treated as an\
    \ ordered list, with the order as\n   defined in Table 1.  For each O/R Address\
    \ attribute, generate the\n   equivalent directory naming attribute.  In most\
    \ cases, the mapping is\n   mechanical.  Printable String or Teletex encodings\
    \ are chosen as\n   appropriate.  Where both forms are present in the O/R Address,\
    \ either\n   form may be used to generate the distinguished name.  Both will be\n\
    \   represented in the DIT. There are two special cases:\n   1.  A DDA generates\
    \ a multi-valued RDN\n   2.  The Personal Name is mapped to a multi-valued RDN\n\
    \   In many cases, an O/R Address will be provided, and only the higher\n   components\
    \ of the address will be represented in the DIT. In this\n   case, the \"longest\
