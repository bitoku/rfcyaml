  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO)\n\
    \   [RFC4119] is the recommended way of encoding location information and\n  \
    \ associated privacy policies.  Location information in a PIDF-LO may\n   be described\
    \ in a geospatial manner based on a subset of Geography\n   Markup Language (GML)\
    \ 3.1.1 [OGC-GML3.1.1] or as civic location\n   information [RFC5139].  A GML\
    \ profile for expressing geodetic shapes\n   in a PIDF-LO is described in [GeoShape].\
    \  Uses for the PIDF-LO are\n   envisioned in the context of numerous location-based\
    \ applications.\n   This document makes recommendations for formats and conventions\
    \ to\n   make interoperability less problematic.\n   The PIDF-LO provides a general\
    \ presence format for representing\n   location information, and permits specification\
    \ of location\n   information relating to a whole range of aspects of a Target.\
    \  The\n   general presence data model is described in [RFC4479] and caters to\
    \ a\n   presence document to describe different aspects of the reachability\n\
    \   of a presentity.  Continuing this approach, a presence document may\n   contain\
    \ several GEOPRIV objects that specify different locations and\n   aspects of\
    \ reachability relating to a presentity.  This degree of\n   flexibility is important,\
    \ and recommendations in this document make\n   no attempt to forbid the usage\
    \ of a PIDF-LO in this manner.  This\n   document provides a specific set of guidelines\
    \ for building presence\n   documents when it is important to unambiguously convey\
    \ exactly one\n   location.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n\
    \   The definition for \"Target\" is taken from [RFC3693].\n   In this document\
    \ a \"discrete location\" is defined as a place, point,\n   area, or volume in\
    \ which a Target can be found.\n   The term \"compound location\" is used to describe\
    \ location information\n   represented by a composite of both civic and geodetic\
    \ information.\n   An example of compound location might be a geodetic polygon\n\
    \   describing the perimeter of a building and a civic element\n   representing\
    \ the floor in the building.\n   The term \"method\" in this document refers to\
    \ the mechanism used to\n   determine the location of a Target.  This may be something\
    \ employed\n   by a location information server (LIS), or by the Target itself.\
    \  It\n   specifically does not refer to the location configuration protocol\n\
    \   (LCP) used to deliver location information either to the Target or\n   the\
    \ Recipient.\n   The term \"source\" is used to refer to the LIS, node, or device\
    \ from\n   which a Recipient (Target or Third-Party) obtains location\n   information.\n"
- title: 3.  Using Location Information
  contents:
  - "3.  Using Location Information\n   The PIDF format provides for an unbounded\
    \ number of <tuple>,\n   <device>, and <person> elements.  Each of these elements\
    \ contains a\n   single <status> element that may contain more than one <geopriv>\n\
    \   element as a child.  Each <geopriv> element must contain at least the\n  \
    \ following two child elements: <location-info> element and <usage-\n   rules>\
    \ element.  One or more elements containing location information\n   are contained\
    \ inside a <location-info> element.\n   Hence, a single PIDF document may contain\
    \ an arbitrary number of\n   location objects, some or all of which may be contradictory\
    \ or\n   complementary.  Graphically, the structure of a PIDF-LO document can\n\
    \   be depicted as shown in Figure 1.\n   <presence>\n      <tuple> -- #1\n  \
    \       <status>\n            <geopriv> -- #1\n               <location-info>\n\

    \ 1: Structure of a PIDF-LO Document\n   All of these potential sources and storage\
    \ places for location lead\n   to confusion for the generators, conveyors, and\
    \ consumers of location\n   information.  Practical experience within the United\
    \ States National\n   Emergency Number Association (NENA) in trying to solve these\n\
    \   ambiguities led to a set of conventions being adopted.  These rules\n   do\
    \ not have any particular order, but should be followed by creators\n   and consumers\
    \ of location information contained in a PIDF-LO to\n   ensure that a consistent\
    \ interpretation of the data can be achieved.\n   Rule #1:  A <geopriv> element\
    \ MUST describe a discrete location.\n   Rule #2:  Where a discrete location can\
    \ be uniquely described in more\n      than one way, each location description\
    \ SHOULD reside in a\n      separate <tuple>, <device>, or <person> element; only\
    \ one geopriv\n      element per tuple.\n   Rule #3:  Providing more than one\
    \ <geopriv> element in a single\n      presence document (PIDF) MUST only be done\
    \ if the locations refer\n      to the same place or are put into different element\
    \ types.  For\n      example, one location in a <tuple>, a second location in\
    \ a\n      <device> element, and a third location in a <person> element.\n   \
    \      This may occur if a Target's location is determined using a\n         series\
    \ of different techniques or if the Target wishes to\n         represent her location\
    \ as well as the location of her PC.  In\n         general, avoid putting more\
    \ than one location into a document\n         unless it makes sense to do so.\n\
    \   Rule #4:  Providing more than one location chunk in a single\n      <location-info>\
    \ element SHOULD be avoided where possible.  Rule #5\n      and Rule #6 provide\
    \ further refinement.\n   Rule #5:  When providing more than one location chunk\
    \ in a single\n      <location-info> element, the locations MUST be provided by\
    \ a\n      common source at the same time and by the same location\n      determination\
    \ method.\n   Rule #6:  Providing more than one location chunk in a single\n \
    \     <location-info> element SHOULD only be used for representing\n      compound\
    \ location referring to the same place.\n         For example, a geodetic location\
    \ describing a point, and a\n         civic location indicating the floor in a\
    \ building.\n   Rule #7:  Where the compound location is provided in a single\n\
    \      <location-info> element, the coarse location information MUST be\n    \
    \  provided first.\n         For example, a geodetic location describing an area\
    \ and a civic\n         location indicating the floor should be represented with\
    \ the\n         area first followed by the civic location.\n   Rule #8:  Where\
    \ a PIDF document contains more than one <geopriv>\n      element, the priority\
    \ of interpretation is given to the first\n      <device> element in the document\
    \ containing a location.  If no\n      <device> element containing a location\
    \ is present in the document,\n      then priority is given to the first <tuple>\
    \ element containing a\n      location.  Locations contained in <person> tuples\
    \ SHOULD only be\n      used as a last resort.\n   Rule #9:  Where multiple PIDF\
    \ documents can be sent or received\n      together, say in a multi-part MIME\
    \ body, and current location\n      information is required by the recipient,\
    \ then document selection\n      SHOULD be based on document order, with the first\
    \ document\n      considered first.\n   The following examples illustrate the\
    \ application of these rules.\n"

  - "5.  Geodetic Shape Representation\n   The cellular mobile world today makes extensive\
    \ use of geodetic-based\n   location information for emergency and other location-based\n\
    \   applications.  Generally, these locations are expressed as a point\n   (either\
    \ in two or three dimensions) and an area or volume of\n   uncertainty around\
    \ the point.  In theory, the area or volume\n   represents a coverage in which\
    \ the user has a relatively high\n   probability of being found, and the point\
    \ is a convenient means of\n   defining the centroid for the area or volume. \
    \ In practice, most\n   systems use the point as an absolute value and ignore\
    \ the\n   uncertainty.  It is difficult to determine if systems have been\n  \
    \ implemented in this manner for simplicity, and even more difficult to\n   predict\
    \ if uncertainty will play a more important role in the future.\n   An important\
    \ decision is whether an uncertainty area should be\n   specified.\n   The PIDF-LO\
    \ Geodetic Shapes specification [GeoShape] defines eight\n   shape types, most\
    \ of which are easily translated into shape\n   definitions used in other applications\
    \ and protocols, such as the\n   Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Mobile Location Protocol\
    \ (MLP).  For\n   completeness, the shapes defined in [GeoShape] are listed below:\n\
    \   o  Point (2d and 3d)\n   o  Polygon (2d)\n   o  Circle (2d)\n   o  Ellipse\
    \ (2d)\n   o  Arc band (2d)\n   o  Sphere (3d)\n   o  Ellipsoid (3d)\n   o  Prism\
    \ (3d)\n   The above-listed shapes MUST be implemented.\n   The GeoShape specification\
    \ [GeoShape] also describes a standard set\n   of coordinate reference systems\
    \ (CRS), unit of measure (UoM) and\n   conventions relating to lines and distances.\
    \  The use of the world\n   geodetic system 1984 (WGS84) [WGS84] coordinate reference\
    \ system and\n   the usage of European petroleum survey group (EPSG) code 4326\
    \ (as\n   identified by the URN urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326, [CRS-URN]) for two-\n\
    \   dimensional (2d) shape representations and EPSG 4979 (as identified\n   by\
    \ the URN urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4979) for three-dimensional (3d)\n   volume representations\
    \ is mandated.  Distance and heights are\n   expressed in meters using EPSG 9001\
    \ (as identified by the URN\n   urn:ogc:def:uom:EPSG::9001).  Angular measures\
    \ MUST use either\n   degrees or radians.  Measures in degrees MUST be identified\
    \ by the\n   URN urn:ogc:def:uom:EPSG::9102, measures in radians MUST be\n   identified\
    \ by the URN urn:ogc:def:uom:EPSG::9101.  Angles\n   representing bearings are\
    \ measured in a clockwise direction from\n   Northing, as defined by the WGS84\
    \ CRS, not magnetic north.\n   Implementations MUST specify the CRS using the\
    \ srsName attribute on\n   the outermost geometry element.  The CRS MUST NOT be\
    \ respecified or\n   changed for any sub-elements.  The srsDimension attribute\
    \ SHOULD be\n   omitted, since the number of dimensions in these CRSs is known.\
    \  A\n   CRS MUST be specified using the above URN notation only;\n   implementations\
    \ do not need to support user-defined CRSs.\n   Numerical values for coordinates\
    \ and measures are expressed using the\n   lexical representation for \"double\"\
    \ defined in\n   [W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028].  Leading zeros and trailing zeros\n\
    \   past the decimal point are not significant; for instance \"03.07500\"\n  \
    \ is equivalent to \"3.075\".\n   It is RECOMMENDED that uncertainty is expressed\
    \ at a confidence of\n   95% or higher.  Specifying a convention for confidence\
    \ enables better\n   use of uncertainty values.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Polygon Restrictions
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Polygon Restrictions\n   The polygon shape type defined in [GeoShape] intentionally\
    \ does not\n   place any constraints on the number of vertices that may be included\n\
    \   to define the bounds of a polygon.  This allows arbitrarily complex\n   shapes\
    \ to be defined and conveyed in a PIDF-LO.  However, where\n   location information\
    \ is to be used in real-time processing\n   applications, such as location-dependent\
    \ routing, having arbitrarily\n   complex shapes consisting of tens or even hundreds\
    \ of points could\n   result in significant performance impacts.  To mitigate\
    \ this risk,\n   Polygon shapes SHOULD be restricted to a maximum of 15 points\
    \ (16\n   including the repeated point) when the location information is\n   intended\
    \ for use in real-time applications.  This limit of 15 points\n   is chosen to\
    \ allow moderately complex shape definitions while at the\n   same time enabling\
    \ interoperation with other location transporting\n   protocols such as those\
    \ defined in the 3rd Generation Partnership\n   Project (3GPP) (see [3GPP.23.032])\
    \ and OMA where the 15-point limit\n   is already imposed.\n   The edges of a\
    \ polygon are defined by the shortest path between two\n   points in space (not\
    \ a geodesic curve).  Two-dimensional points MAY\n   be interpreted as having\
    \ a zero value for their altitude component.\n   To avoid significant errors arising\
    \ from potential geodesic\n   interpolation, the length between adjacent vertices\
    \ SHOULD be\n   restricted to a maximum of 130 km.  More information relating\
    \ to this\n   restriction is provided in [GeoShape].\n   A connecting line SHALL\
    \ NOT cross another connecting line of the same\n   Polygon.\n   Polygons MUST\
    \ be defined with the upward normal pointing up.  This is\n   accomplished by\
    \ defining the vertices in a counter-clockwise\n   direction.\n   Points specified\
    \ in a polygon using three-dimensional coordinates\n   MUST all have the same\
    \ altitude.\n"

  - "5.2.  Shape Examples\n   This section provides some examples of where some of\
    \ the more complex\n   shapes are used, how they are determined, and how they\

    \  An angle is used to express the\n   orientation of the ellipsoid.  The orientation\
