    \ an\n   ad-hoc working group was assembled to develop a set of\n   recommendations\
    \ on the research required to achieve a ubiquitous\n   high-bandwidth network\
    \ as discussed in the FCCSET recommendations for\n   Phase III.\n   This report\
    \ outlines a set of research topics aimed at providing the\n   technology base\
    \ for an interconnected set of networks that can\n   provide highbandwidth capabilities.\
    \  The suggested research focus\n   draws upon ongoing research and augments it\
    \ with basic and applied\n   components.  The major activities are the development\
    \ and\n   demonstration of a gigabit backbone network, the development and\n \
    \  demonstration of an interconnected set of networks with gigabit\n   throughput\
    \ and appropriate management techniques, and the development\n   and demonstration\
    \ of the required overall architecture that allows\n   users to gain access to\
    \ such high bandwidth.\n   1.  Introduction and Summary\n   1.1.  Background\n\
    \   The computer communications world is evolving toward both high-\n   bandwidth\
    \ capability and high-bandwidth requirements.  The recent\n   workshop conducted\
    \ under the auspices of the FCCSET Committee on High\n   Performance Computing\
    \ [1] identified a number of areas where\n   extremely high-bandwidth networking\
    \ is required to support the\n   scientific research community.  These areas range\
    \ from remote\n   graphical visualization of supercomputer results through the\
    \ movement\n   of high rate sensor data from space to the ground-based scientific\n\
    \   investigator.  Similar requirements exist for other applications,\n   such\
    \ as military command and control (C2) where there is a need to\n   quickly access\
    \ and act on data obtained from real-time sensors.  The\n   workshop identified\
    \ requirements for switched high-bandwidth service\n   in excess of 300 Mbit/s\
    \ to a single user, and the need to support\n   service in the range of a Mbit/s\
    \ on a low-duty-cycle basis to\n   millions of researchers.  When added to the\
    \ needs of the military and\n   commercial users, the aggregate requirement for\
    \ communications\n   service adds up to many billions of bits per second.  The\
    \ results of\n   this workshop were incorporated into a report by the FCCSET [2].\n\
    \   Fortunately, technology is also moving rapidly.  Even today, the\n   installed\
    \ base of fiber optics communications allows us to consider\n   aggregate bandwidths\
    \ in the range of Gbit/s and beyond to limited\n   geographical regions.  Estimates\
    \ arrived at in the workshop lead one\n   to believe that there will be available\
    \ raw bandwidth approaching\n   terabits per second.\n   The critical question\
    \ to be addressed is how this raw bandwidth can\n   be used to satisfy the requirements\
    \ identified in the workshop: 1)\n   provide bandwidth on the order of several\
    \ Gbit/s to individual users,\n   and 2) provide modest bandwidth on the order\
    \ of several Mbit/s to a\n   large number of users in a cost-effective manner\
    \ through the\n   aggregation of their traffic.\n   Through its research funding,\
    \ the Defense Advanced Research Projects\n   Agency (DARPA) has played a central\
    \ role in the development of\n   packet-oriented communications, which has been\
    \ of tremendous benefit\n   to the U.S. military in terms of survivability and\
    \ interoperability.\n   DARPA-funded research has resulted in the ARPANET, the\
    \ first packet-\n   switched network; the SATNET, MATNET and Wideband Network,\
    \ which\n   demonstrated the efficient utilization of shared-access satellite\n\
    \   channels for communications between geographically diverse sites;\n   packet\
    \ radio networks for mobile tactical environments; the Internet\n   and TCP/IP\
    \ protocols for interconnection and interoperability between\n   heterogeneous\
    \ networks and computer systems; the development of\n   electronic mail; and many\
    \ advances in the areas of network security,\n   privacy, authentication and access\
    \ control for distributed computing\n   environments.  Recognizing DARPA's past\
    \ accomplishments and its\n   desire to continue to take a leading role in addressing\
    \ these issues,\n   this document provides a recommendation for research topics\
    \ in\n   gigabit networking.  It is meant to be an organized compendium of the\n\
    \   critical research issues to be addressed in developing the technology\n  \
    \ base needed for such a high bandwidth ubiquitous network.\n   1.2.  Ongoing\
    \ Activities\n   The OSTP report referred to above recommended a three-phase approach\n\
    \   to achieving the required high-bandwidth networking for the\n   scientific\
    \ and research community.  Some of this work is now well\n   underway.  An ad-hoc\
    \ committee, the Federal Research Internet\n   Coordinating Committee (FRICC)\
    \ is coordinating the interconnection of\n   the current wide area networking\
    \ systems in the government; notably\n   those of DARPA, Department of Energy\
    \ (DoE), National Science\n   Foundation (NSF), National Aeronautics and Space\
    \ Administration\n   (NASA), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\
    \  In\n   accordance with Phases I and II of the OSTP report, this activity\n\
    \   will provide for an interconnected set of networks to support\n   research\
    \ and other scholarly pursuits, and provide a basis for future\n   networking\
    \ for this community.  The networking is being upgraded\n   through shared increased\
    \ bandwidth (current plans are to share a 45\n   Mbit/s backbone) and coordinated\
    \ interconnection with the rest of the\n   world.  In particular, the FRICC is\
    \ working with the European\n   networking community under the auspices of another\
    \ ad-hoc group, the\n   Coordinating Committee for Intercontinental Research Networks\n\
    \   (CCIRN), to establish effective US-Europe networking.\n   However, as the\
    \ OSTP recommendations note, the required bandwidth for\n   the future is well\
    \ beyond currently planned public, private, and\n   government networks.  Achieving\
    \ the required gigabit networking\n   capabilities will require a strong research\
    \ activity.  There is\n   considerable ongoing research in relevant areas that\
    \ can be drawn\n   upon; particularly in the areas of high-bandwidth communication\n\
    \   links, high-speed computer switching, and high-bandwidth local area\n   networks.\
    \  Appendix A provides some pointers to current research\n   efforts.\n   1.3.\
    \  Document Overview\n   This report outlines a set of research topics aimed at\
    \ providing the\n   technology base for an interconnected set of networks that\
    \ can\n   provide the required high-bandwidth capabilities discussed above.\n\
    \   The suggested research focus draws upon ongoing research and augments\n  \
    \ it with basic and applied components.  The major activities are the\n   development\
    \ and demonstration of a Gigabit Backbone network (GB) [3],\n   the development\
    \ and demonstration of an interconnected set of\n   networks with gigabit throughput\
    \ and appropriate management\n   techniques, and the development and demonstration\
    \ of the required\n   overall architecture that allows users to gain access to\
    \ such high\n   bandwidth.  Section 2 discusses functional and performance goals\n\
    \   along with the anticipated benefits to the ultimate users of such a\n   system.\
    \  Section 3 provides the discussion of the critical research\n   issues needed\
    \ to achieve these goals.  It is organized into the major\n   areas of technology\
    \ that need to be addressed: general architectural\n   issues, high-bandwidth\
    \ switching, high-bandwidth host interfaces,\n   network management algorithms,\
    \ and network services.  The discussion\n   in some cases contains examples of\
    \ ongoing relevant research or\n   potential approaches.  These examples are intended\
    \ to clarify the\n   issues and not to propose that particular approach.  A discussion\
    \ of\n   the relationship of the suggested research to other ongoing\n   activities\
    \ and optimal methods for pursuing this research is provided\n   in Section 4.\n\
    \   2.  Functional and Performance Goals\n   In this section, we provide an assessment\
    \ of the types of services a\n   GN (four or five orders of magnitude faster than\
    \ the current\n   networks) should provide to its users.  In instances where we\
    \ felt\n   there would be a significant impact on performance, we have provided\n\
    \   an estimate of the amount of bandwidth needed and delay allowable to\n   provide\
    \ these services.\n   2.1.  Networking Application Support\n   It is envisioned\
    \ that the GN will be capable of supporting all of the\n   following types of\
    \ networking applications.\n   Currently Provided Packet Services\n      It is\
    \ important that the network provide the users with the\n      equivalent of services\
    \ that are already available in packet-\n      switched networks, such as interactive\
    \ data exchange, mail\n      service, file transfer, on-line access to remote\
    \ computing\n      resources, etc., and allow them to expand to other more advanced\n\
    \      services to meet their needs as they become available.\n   Multi-Media\
    \ Mail\n      This capability will allow users to take advantage of different\n\
    \      media types (e.g., graphics, images, voice, and video as well as\n    \
    \  text and computer data) in the transfer of messages, thereby\n      increasing\
    \ the effectiveness of message exchange.\n   Multi-Media Conferencing\n      Such\
    \ conferencing requires the exchange of large amounts of\n      information in\
    \ short periods of time.  Hence the requirement for\n      high bandwidth at low\
    \ delay.  We estimate that the bandwidth would\n      range from 1.5 to 100 Mbit/s,\
    \ with an end-to-end delay of no more\n      than a few hundred msec.\n   Computer-Generated\
    \ Real-time Graphics\n      Visualizing computer results in the modern world of\
    \ supercomputers\n      requires large amounts of real time graphics.  This in\
    \ turn will\n      require about 1.5 Mbit/s of bandwidth and no more than several\n\
    \      hundred msec.  delay.\n   High-Speed Transaction Processing\n      One\
    \ of the most important reasons for having an ultra-high-speed\n      network\
    \ is to take advantage of supercomputing capability.  There\n      are several\
    \ scenarios in which this capability could be utilized.\n      For example, there\
    \ could be instances where a non-supercomputer\n      may require a supercomputer\
    \ to perform some processing and provide\n      some intermediate results that\
    \ will be used to perform still\n      further processing, or the exchange may\
    \ be between several\n      supercomputers operating in tandem and periodically\
    \ exchanging\n      results, such as in a battle management, war gaming, or process\n\
    \      control applications.  In such cases, extremely short response\n      times\
    \ are necessary to accomplish as many as hundreds of\n      interactions in real\
    \ time.  This requires very high bandwidth, on\n      the order of 100 Mbit/s,\
    \ and minimum delay, on the order of\n      hundreds of msec.\n   Wide-Area Distributed\
    \ Data/Knowledge Base Management Systems\n      Computer-stored data, information,\
    \ and knowledge is distributed\n      around the country for a variety of reasons.\
    \  The ability to\n      perform complex queries, updates, and report generation\
    \ as though\n      many large databases are one system would be extremely powerful,\n\
    \      yet requires low-delay, high-bandwidth communication for\n      interactive\
    \ use.  The Corporation for National Research\n      Initiatives (NRI) has promoted\
    \ the notion of a National Knowledge\n      base with these characteristics. \
    \ In particular, an attractive\n      approach is to cache views at the user sites,\
    \ or close by to allow\n      efficient repeated queries and multi-relation processing\
    \ for\n      relations on different nodes.  However, with caching, a processing\n\
    \      activity may incur a miss in the midst of a query or update,\n      causing\
    \ it to be delayed by the time required to retrieve the\n      missing relation\
    \ or portion of relation.  To minimize the overhead\n      for cache directories,\
    \ both at the server and client sites, the\n      unit of caching should be large---say\
    \ a megabyte or more.  In\n      addition, to maintain consistency at the caching\
    \ client sites,\n      server sites need to multicast invalidations and/or updates.\n\
    \      Communication requirements are further increased by replication of\n  \
    \    the data.  The critical parameter is latency for cache misses and\n     \
    \ consistency operations.  Taking the distance between sites to be\n      on average\
    \ 1/4 the diameter of the country, a one Gbit/s data rate\n      is required to\
    \ reduce the transmission time to be roughly the same\n      as the propagation\
    \ delay, namely around 8 milliseconds for this\n      size of unit.  Note that\
    \ this application is supporting far more\n      sophisticated queries and updates\
    \ than normally associated with\n      transaction processing, thus requiring\
    \ larger amount of data to be\n      transferred.\n   2.2.  Types of Traffic and\
    \ Communications Modes\n   Different types of traffic may impose different constraints\
    \ in terms\n   of throughput, delay, delay dispersion, reliability and sequenced\n\
    \   delivery.  Table 1 summarizes some of the main characteristics of\n   several\
    \ different types of traffic.\n                Table 1: Communication Traffic\

    \   The topology among users can be of three types: point-to-point (one-\n   to-one\
    \ connectivity), multicast (one sender and multiple receivers),\n   and conferencing\
    \ (multiple senders and multiple receivers).  There\n   are three types of transfers\
    \ that can take place among users.  They\n   are connection-oriented network service,\
    \ connectionless network\n   service, and stream or synchronous traffic.  Connection\
    \ and\n   connectionless services are asynchronous.  A connection-oriented\n \
    \  service assumes and provides for relationships among the multiple\n   packets\
    \ sent over the connection (e.g., to a common destination)\n   while connectionless\
    \ service assumes each packet is a complete and\n   separate entity unto itself.\
    \  For stream or synchronous service a\n   reservation scheme is used to set up\
    \ and guarantee a constant and\n   steady amount of bandwidth between any two\
    \ subscribers.\n   2.3.  Network Backbone\n   The GB needs to be of high bandwidth\
    \ to support a large population of\n   users, and additionally to provide high-speed\
    \ connectivity among\n   certain subscribers who may need such capability (e.g.,\
    \ between two\n   supercomputers).  These users may access the GN from local area\n\
    \   networks (LANs) directly connected to the backbone or via high-speed\n   intermediate\
    \ regional networks.  The backbone must also minimize\n   end-to-end delay to\
    \ support highly interactive high-speed\n   (supercomputer) activities.\n   It\
    \ is important that the LANs that will be connected to the GN be\n   permitted\
    \ data rates independent of the data rates of the GB.  LAN\n   speeds should be\
    \ allowed to change without affecting the GB, and the\n   GB speeds should be\
    \ allowed to change without affecting the LANs.  In\n   this way, development\
    \ of the technology for LANs and the GB can\n   proceed independently.\n   Access\
    \ rate requirements to the GB and the GN will vary depending on\n   user requirements\
    \ and local environments.  The users may require\n   access rates ranging from\
    \ multi-kbit/s in the case of terminals or\n   personal computers connected by\
    \ modems up to multi-Mbit/s and beyond\n   for powerful workstations up to the\
    \ Gbit/s range for high-speed\n   computing and data resources.\n   2.4.  Directory\
    \ Services\n   Directory services similar to those found in CCITT X.500/ISO DIS\
    \ 9594\n   need to be provided.  These include mapping user names to electronic\n\
    \   mail addresses, distribution lists, support for authorization\n   checking,\
    \ access control, and public key encryption schemes,\n   multimedia mail capabilities,\
    \ and the ability to keep track of mobile\n   users (those who move from place\
    \ to place and host computer to host\n   computer).  The directory services may\
    \ also list facilities available\n   to users via the network.  Some examples\
    \ are databases,\n   supercomputing or other special-purpose applications, and\
    \ on-line\n   help or telephone hotlines.\n   The services provided by X.500 may\
    \ require some extension for GN.\n   For example, there is no provision for multilevel\
    \ security, and the\n   approach taken to authentication must be studied to ensure\
    \ that it\n   meets the requirements of GN and its user community.\n   2.5.  Network\
    \ Management and Routing\n   The objective of network management is to ensure\
    \ that the network\n   functions smoothly and efficiently, and consists of the\
    \ following:\n   accounting, security, performance monitoring, fault isolation\
    \ and\n   configuration control.\n   Accounting ensures that users are properly\
    \ billed for the services\n   that the network provides.  Accounting enforces\
    \ a tariff; a tariff\n   expresses a usage policy.  The network need only keep\
    \ track of those\n   items addressed by the tariff, such as allocated bandwidth,\
    \ number of\n   packets sent, number of ports used, etc.  Another type of accounting\n\
    \   may need to be supported by the network to support resource sharing,\n   namely\
    \ accounting analogous to telephone \"900\" numbers.  This\n   accounting performed\
    \ by the network on behalf of resource providers\n   and consumers is a pragmatic\
    \ solution to the problem of getting the\n   users and consumers into a financial\
    \ relationship with each other\n   which has stymied previous attempts to achieve\
    \ widespread use of\n   specialized resources.\n   Performance monitoring is needed\
    \ so that the managers can tell how\n   the network is performing and take the\
    \ necessary actions to keep its\n   performance at a level that will provide users\
    \ with satisfactory\n   service.  Fault isolation using technical control mechanisms\
    \ is\n   needed for network maintenance.  Configuration management allows the\n\
    \   network to function efficiently.\n   Several new types of routing will be\
    \ required by GN.  In addition to\n   true type-of-service, needed to support\
    \ diverse distributed\n   applications, real-time applications, interactive applications,\
    \ and\n   bulk data transfer, there will be need for traffic controls to\n   enforce\
    \ various routing policies.  For example, policy may dictate\n   that traffic\
    \ from certain users, applications,  or hosts may not be\n   permitted to traverse\
    \ certain segments of the network.\n   Alternatively, traffic controls may be\
    \ used to promote fairness; that\n   is, to make sure that busy link or network\
    \ segment isn't dominated by\n   a particular source or destination.  The ability\
    \ of applications to\n   reserve network bandwidth in advance of its use, and\
    \ the use of\n   strategies such as soft connections, will also require development\
    \ of\n   new routing algorithms.\n   2.6.  Network Security Requirements\n   Security\
    \ is a critical factor within the GN and one of those features\n   that are difficult\
    \ to provide.  It is envisioned that both\n   unclassified and classified traffic\
    \ will utilize the GN, so\n   protection mechanisms must be an integral part of\
    \ the network access\n   strategy.  Features such as authentication, integrity,\n\
    \   confidentiality, access control, and nonrepudiation are essential to\n   provide\
    \ trusted and secure communication services for network users.\n   A subscriber\
    \ must have assurance that the person or system he is\n   exchanging information\
    \ with is indeed who he says he is.\n   Authentication provides this assurance\
    \ by verifying that the claimed\n   source of a query request, control command,\
    \ response, etc., is the\n   actual source.  Integrity assures that the subscriber's\
    \ information\n   (such as requests, commands, data, responses, etc.) is not changed,\n\
    \   intentionally or unintentionally, while in transit or by replays of\n   earlier\
    \ traffic.  Unauthorized users (e.g., intruders or network\n   viruses) would\
    \ be denied use of GN assets through access control\n   mechanisms which verify\
    \ that the authenticated source is authorized\n   to receive the requested information\
    \ or to initiate the specified\n   command.  In addition, nonrepudiation services\
    \ can be offered to\n   assure a third party that the transmitted information\
    \ has not been\n   altered.  And finally, confidentiality will ensure that the\
    \ contents\n   of a message are not divulged to unauthorized individuals.\n  \
    \ Subscribers can decide, based upon their own security needs and\n   particular\
    \ activities, which of these services are necessary at a\n   given time.\n   3.\
    \  Critical Research Issues\n   In the section above, we discussed the goals of\
    \ a research program in\n   gigabit networking; namely to provide the technology\
    \ base for a\n   network that will allow gigabit service to be provided in an\n\
    \   effective way.  In this section, we discuss those issues which we\n   feel\
    \ are critical to address in a research program to achieve such\n   goals.\n \
    \  3.1.  General Architectural Issues\n   In the last generation of networks,\
    \ it was assumed that bandwidth was\n   the scarce resource and the design of\
    \ the switch was dictated by the\n   need to manage and allocate the bandwidth\
    \ effectively.  The most\n   basic change in the next generation network is that\
    \ the speeds of the\n   trunks are rising faster than the speeds of the switching\
    \ elements.\n   This change in the balance of speeds has manifested itself in\
    \ several\n   ways.  In most current designs for local area networks, where\n\
    \   bandwidth is not expensive, the design decision was to trade off\n   effective\
    \ use of the bandwidth for a simplified switching technique.\n   In particular,\
    \ networks such as Ethernet use broadcast as the normal\n   distribution method,\
    \ which essentially eliminates the need for a\n   switching element.\n   As we\
    \ look at still higher speed networks, and in particular networks\n   in which\
    \ the bandwidth is still the expensive component, we must\n   design new options\
    \ for switching which will permit effective use of\n   bandwidth without the switch\
    \ itself becoming the bottleneck.\n   The central thrust of new research must\
    \ thus be to explore new\n   network architectures that are consistent with these\
    \ very different\n   speed assumptions.\n   The development of computer communications\
    \ has been tremendously\n   distorted by the characteristics of wide-area networking:\
    \ normally\n   high cost, low speed, high error rate, large delay.  The time is\
    \ ripe\n   for a revolution in thinking, technology, and approaches, analogous\n\
    \   to the revolution caused by VCR technology over 8 and 16 mm. film\n   technology.\n\
    \   Fiber optics is clearly the enabling technology for high-speed\n   transmission,\
    \ in fact, so much so that there is an expectation that\n   the switching elements\
    \ will now hold down the data rates.  Both\n   conventional circuit switching\
    \ and packet switching have significant\n   problems at higher data rates.  For\
    \ instance, circuit switching\n   requires increasing delays for FTDM synchronization\
    \ to handle skew.\n   In the case of packet switching, traditional approaches\
    \ require too\n   much processing per packet to handle the tremendous data flow.\
    \  The\n   problem for both switching regimes is the \"intelligence\" in the\n\
    \   switches, which in turn requires electronics technology.\n   Besides intelligence,\
    \ another problem for wide-area networks is\n   storage, both because it ties\
    \ us to electronics (for the foreseeable\n   future) and because it produces instabilities\
    \ in a large-scale\n   system.  (See, for instance, the work by Van Jacobson on\
    \ self-\n   organizing phenomena for self-destruction in the Internet.)\n   Techniques\
    \ are required to eliminate dependence on storage, such as\n   cut-through routing.\n\
    \   Overall, high-speed WANs are the greatest agents of change, the\n   greatest\
    \ catalyst both commercially and militarily, and the area ripe\n   for revolution.\
    \  Judging by the attributes of current high-speed\n   network research prototypes,\
    \ WANs of the future will be photonic,\n   multi-gigabit networks with enormous\
    \ throughput, low delay, and low\n   error rate.\n   A zero-based budgeting approach\
    \ is required to develop the new high-\n   speed internetwork architecture.  That\
    \ is, the time is ripe to\n   significantly rethink the Internet, building on\
    \ experience with this\n   system.  Issues of concern are manageability, understanding\n\
    \   evolvability and support for the new communication requirements,\n   including\
    \ remote procedure call, real-time, security and fault-\n   tolerance.\n   The\
    \ GN must be able to deal with two sources of high-bandwidth\n   requirements.\
    \  There will be some end devices (computers) connected\n   more or less directly\
    \ to the GN because of their individual\n   requirements for high bandwidth (e.g.,\
    \ supercomputers needing to\n   drive remote high-bandwidth graphics devices).\
    \  In addition, the\n   aggregate traffic due to large numbers of moderate rate\
    \ users\n   (estimates are roughly up to a million potential users needing up\
    \ to\n   1 Mbit/s at any given time) results in a high-bandwidth requirement\n\
    \   in total on the GN.  The statistics of such traffic are different and\n  \
    \ there are different possible technical approaches for dealing with\n   them.\
    \  Thus, an architectural approach for dealing with both must be\n   developed.\n\
    \   Overall, the next-generation architecture has to be, first and\n   foremost,\
    \ a management architecture.  The directions in link speeds,\n   processor speeds\
    \ and memory solve the performance problems for many\n   communication situations\
    \ so well that manageability becomes the\n   predominant concern.  (In fact, fast\
    \ communication makes large\n   systems more prone to performance, reliability,\
    \ and security\n   problems.)  In many ways, the management system of the internetwork\n\
    \   is the ultimate distributed system.  The solution to this tough\n   problem\
    \ may well require the best talents from the communications,\n   operating systems\
    \ and distributed systems communities, perhaps even\n   drawing on database and\
    \ parallelism research.\n   3.1.1.  High-Speed Internet using High-Speed Networks\n\
    \   The GN will need to take advantage of a multitude of different and\n   heterogeneous\
    \ networks, all of high speed.  In addition to networks\n   based on the technology\
    \ of the GB, there will be high-speed LANs.  A\n   key issue in the development\
    \ of the GN will be the development of a\n   strategy for interconnecting such\
    \ networks to provide gigabit service\n   on an end to end basis.  This will involve\
    \ techniques for switching,\n   interfacing, and management (as discussed in the\
    \ sections below)\n   coupled with an architecture that allows the GN to take\
    \ full\n   advantage of the performance of the various high-speed networks.\n\
    \   3.1.2.  Network Organization\n   The GN will need an architecture that supports\
    \ the need to manage the\n   system as well as obtain high performance.  We note\
    \ that almost all\n   human-engineered systems are hierarchically structured from\
    \ the\n   standpoint of control, monitoring, and information flow.  A\n   hierarchical\
    \ design may be the key to manageability in the next-\n   generation architecture.\n\
    \   One approach is to use a general three-level structure, corresponding\n  \
    \ to interadministrational, intraadministrational, and cluster\n   networks. \
    \ The first level interconnects communication facilities of\n   truly separate\
    \ administrations where there is significant separation\n   of security, accounting,\
    \ and goals.  The second level interconnects\n   subadministrations which exist\
    \ for management convenience in large\n   organizations.  For example, a research\
    \ group within a university may\n   function as a subadministration.  The cluster\
    \ level consists of\n   networks configured to provides maximal performance among\
    \ hosts which\n   are in frequent communication, such as a set of diskless workstations\n\
    \   and their common file server.  These hosts are typically, but not\n   necessarily,\
    \ geographically collocated.  For example, two remote\n   networks may be tightly\
    \ coupled by a fiber optic link that bridges\n   between the two physical networks,\
    \ making them function as one.\n   Research along these lines should study the\
    \ interorganizational\n   characteristics of communications, such as those being\
    \ investigated\n   by the IAB Task Force on Autonomous Networks.  Based on current\n\
    \   results, we expect that such work would clearly demonstrate that\n   considerable\
    \ communication takes place between particular\n   subadministrations in different\
    \ administrations; communication\n   patterns are not strictly hierarchical. \
    \ For example, there might be\n   intense direct communication between the experimental\
    \ physics\n   departments of two independent universities, or between the computer\n\
    \   support group of one company and the operating system development\n   group\
    \ of another.  In addition, (sub)administrations may well also\n   require divisions\
    \ into public information and private information.\n   3.1.3.  Fault-Tolerant\
    \ System\n   Although the GN will be developed as part of an experimental research\n\
    \   program, it will also serve as part of the infrastructure for\n   researchers\
    \ who are experimenting with applications which will use\n   such a network. \
    \ The GN must have reasonably high availability to\n   support these research\
    \ activities.  In addition to facilitate the\n   transfer of this technology to\
    \ future operational military and\n   commercial users, it will need to be designed\
    \ to become highly\n   reliable.  This can be accomplished through diversity of\
    \ transmission\n   paths, the development of fault-tolerant switches, use of a\n\
    \   distributed control structure with self-correcting algorithms, and\n   the\
    \ protection of network control traffic.  The architecture of a GN\n   should\
    \ support and allow for all of these things.\n   3.1.4.  Functional Division of\
    \ Control Between Network Elements\n   Current protocol architectures use the\
    \ layered model of functional\n   decomposition first developed in the early work\
    \ on ARPANET protocols.\n   The concept of layering has been a powerful concept\
    \ which has allowed\n   dramatic variation in network technologies without requiring\
    \ the\n   complete reimplementation of applications.  The concept of layering\n\
    \   has had a first-order impact on the development of international\n   standards\
    \ for data communication---witness the ISO \"Reference Model\n   for Open Systems\
    \ Interconnection.\"\n   Unfortunately, however, the powerful concept of layering\
    \ has been\n   paired, both in the DoD Internet work and the ISO work, with an\n\
    \   extremely weak concept of the interface between layers.  The\n   interface\
    \ designs are all organized around the idea of commands and\n   responses plus\
    \ an error indicator.  For example, the TCP service\n   interface provides the\
    \ user with commands to set up or close a TCP\n   connection and commands to send\
    \ and receive datagrams.  The user may\n   well \"know\" whether they are using\
    \ a file transfer service or a\n   character-at-a- time virtual terminal, but\
    \ can't tell the TCP.  The\n   underlying network may \"know\" that failures have\
    \ reduced the path to\n   the user's destination to a single 9.6 kbit/s link,\
    \ but it also can't\n   tell the TCP implementation.\n   All of the information\
    \ that an analyst would consider crucial in\n   diagnosing system performance\
    \ is carefully hidden from adjacent\n   layers.  One \"solution\" often discussed\
    \ (but rarely implemented) is\n   to condense all of this information into a few\
    \ bits of \"Type of\n   Service\" or \"Quality of Service\" request flowing in\
    \ one direction\n   only---from application to network.  It seems likely that\
    \ this\n   approach cannot succeed, both because it applies too much compression\n\
    \   to the knowledge available and because it does not provide two-way\n   flow.\n\
    \   We believe it to be likely that the next-generation network will\n   require\
    \ a much richer interface between every pair of adjacent layers\n   if adequate\
    \ performance is to be achieved.  Research is needed into\n   the conceptual mechanisms,\
    \ both indicators and controls, that can be\n   implemented at these interfaces\
    \ and that, when used, will result in\n   better performance.  If real differences\
    \ in performance can be\n   observed, then the implementors of every layer will\
    \ have a strong\n   incentive to make use of the mechanisms.\n   We can observe\
    \ the first glimmers of this sort of coordination\n   between layers in current\
    \ work.  For example, in the ISO work there\n   are 5 classes of transport protocol\
    \ which are supposed to provide a\n   range of possible matches between application\
    \ needs and network\n   capabilities.  Unfortunately, it is the case today that\
    \ the class of\n   transport protocol is chosen statically, by the implementer,\
    \ rather\n   than dynamically.  The DARPA Wideband net offers a choice of stream\n\
    \   or datagram service, but typically a given host uses all one or all\n   the\
    \ other---again, a static rather than a dynamic choice.  The\n   research that\
    \ we believe is needed, therefore, is not how to provide\n   alternatives, but\
    \ how to provide them and choose among them on a\n   dynamic, real-time basis.\n\
    \   3.1.5.  Different Switch Technologies\n   One approach to high-performance\
    \ networking is to design a technology\n   that is expected to work as a stand-alone\
    \ demonstration, without\n   addressing the need for interconnection to other\
    \ networks.  Such an\n   experiment may be very valuable for rapid exploration\
    \ of the design\n   space.  However, our experience with the Internet project\
    \ suggests\n   that a primary research goal should be the development of a network\n\
    \   architecture that permits the interconnection of a number of\n   different\
    \ switching technologies.\n   The Internet project was successful to a large extent\
    \ because it\n   could incorporate a number of new and preexisting network\n \
    \  technologies: various local area networks, store and forward\n   switching\
    \ networks, broadcast satellite nets, packet radio networks,\n   and so on.  In\
    \ this way, it decoupled the use of the protocols from a\n   particular technology\
    \ base.  In fact, the technology base evolved\n   rapidly, but the Internet protocols\
    \ themselves provided a stability\n   that led to their success.\n   The next-generation\
    \ architecture must similarly deal with a diverse\n   and evolving technology\
    \ base.  We see \"fast-packet\" switching now\n   being developed (for example\
    \ in B-ISDN); we see photonic switching\n   and wavelength division multiplexing\
    \ as more advanced technologies.\n   We must divorce our architecture from dependence\
    \ on any one of these.\n   At the host interface, we must divorce the multiplexing\
    \ of the medium\n   from the form of data that the host sees.  Today the packet\
    \ is used\n   both as multiplexing and interface element.  In the future, the\
    \ host\n   may see the network as a message-passing system, or as memory.  At\n\
    \   the same time, the network may use classic packets, wavelength\n   division,\
    \ or space division switching.\n   A number of basic functions must be rethought\
    \ to provide an\n   architecture that is not dependent on the underlying switching\
    \ model.\n   For example, our transport protocols assume that data will be lost\
    \ in\n   units of a packet.  If part of a packet is lost, we discard the whole\n\
    \   thing.  And if several packets are systematically lost in sequence,\n   we\
    \ may not recover effectively.  There must be a host-level unit of\n   error recovery\
    \ that is independent of the network.  This sort of\n   abstraction must be applied\
    \ to all the aspects of service\n   specification: error recovery, flow control,\
    \ addressing, and so on.\n   3.1.6.  Network Operations, Monitoring, and Control\n\
    \   There is a hierarchy of progressively more effective and\n   sophisticated\
    \ techniques for network management that applies\n   regardless of network bandwidth\
    \ and application considerations:\n      1.  Reactive problem management\n   \
    \   2.  Reactive resource management\n      3.  Proactive problem management\n\
    \      4.  Proactive resource management.\n   Today's network management strategies\
    \ are primarily reactive rather\n   than proactive:  Problem management is initiated\
    \ in response to user\n   complaints about service outages; resource allocation\
    \ decisions are\n   made when users complain about deterioration of quality of\
    \ service.\n   Today's network management systems are stuck at step 1 or perhaps\n\
    \   step 2 of the hierarchy.\n   Future network management systems will provide\
    \ proactive problem\n   management---problem diagnosis and restoral of service\
    \ before users\n   become aware that there was a problem; and proactive resource\n\
    \   management---dynamic allocation of network bandwidth and switching\n   resources\
    \ to ensure that an acceptable level of service is\n   continuously maintained.\n\
    \   The GN management system should be expected to provide proactive\n   problem\
    \ and resource management capabilities.  It will have to do so\n   while contending\
    \ with three important changes in the managed network\n   environment:\n     \
    \ 1.  More complicated devices under management\n      2.  More diverse types\
    \ of devices\n      3.  More variety of application protocols.\n   Performance\
    \ under these conditions will require that we seriously\n   re-think how a network\
    \ management system handles the expected high\n   volumes of raw management-related\
    \ data.  It will become especially\n   important for the system to provide thresholding,\
    \ filtering, and\n   alerting mechanisms that can save the human operator from\
    \ drowning in\n   data, while still permitting access to details when diagnostic\
    \ or\n   fault isolation modes are invoked.\n   The presence of expert assistant\
    \ capabilities for early fault\n   detection, diagnosis, and problem resolution\
    \ will be mandatory.\n   These capabilities are highly desirable today, but they\
    \ will be\n   essential to contend with the complexity and diversity of devices\
    \ and\n   applications in the Gigabit Network.\n   In addition to its role in\
    \ dealing with complexity, automation\n   provides the only hope of controlling\
    \ and reducing the high costs of\n   daily management and operation of a GN.\n\
    \   Proactive resource management in GNs must be better understood and\n   practiced,\
    \ initially as an effort requiring human intervention and\n   direction.  Once\
    \ this is achieved, it too must become automated to a\n   high degree in the GN.\n\
    \   3.1.7.  Naming and Addressing Strategies\n   Current networks, both voice\
    \ (telephone) and data, use addressing\n   structures which closely tie the address\
    \ to the physical location on\n   the network.  That is, the address identifies\
    \ a physical access\n   point, rather than the higher-level entity (computer,\
    \ process, human)\n   attached to that access point.  In future networks, this\
    \ physical\n   aspect of addressing must be removed.\n   Consider, for example,\
    \ finding the desired party in the telephone\n   network of today.  For a person\
    \ not at his listed number, finding the\n   number of the correct telephone may\
    \ require preliminary calls, in\n   which advice is given to the person placing\
    \ the call.  This works\n   well when a human is placing the call, since humans\
    \ are well equipped\n   to cope with arbitrary conversations.  But if a computer\
    \ is placing\n   the call, the process of obtaining the correct address will have\
    \ to\n   be incorporated in the architecture as a core service of the network.\n\
    \   Since it is reasonable to expect mobile hosts, hosts that are\n   connected\
    \ to multiple networks, and replicated hosts, the issue of\n   mapping to the\
    \ physical address must be properly resolved.\n   To permit the network to maintain\
    \ the dynamic mapping to current\n   physical address, it is necessary that high-level\
    \ entities have a\n   name (or logical address) that identifies them independently\
    \ of\n   location.  The name is maintained by the network, and mapped to the\n\
    \   current physical location as a core network service.  For example,\n   mobile\
    \ hosts, hosts that are connected to multiple networks, and\n   replicated hosts\
    \ would have static names whose mapping to physical\n   addresses (many-to-one,\
    \ in some cases) would change with time.\n   Hosts are not the only entities whose\
    \ physical location varies.\n   Users' electronic mail addresses change.  Within\
    \ distributed systems,\n   processes and files migrate from host to host.  In\
    \ a computing\n   environment where robustness and survivability are important,\
    \ entire\n   applications may move about, or they may be redundant.\n   The needed\
    \ function must be considered in the context of the mobility\n   and address resolution\
    \ rates if all addresses in a global data\n   network were of this sort.  The\
    \ distributed network directory\n   discussed elsewhere in this report should\
    \ be designed to provide the\n   necessary flexibility, and responsiveness.  The\
    \ nature and\n   administration of names must also be considered.\n   Names that\
    \ are arbitrary or unwieldy would be barely better than the\n   addresses used\
    \ now.  The name space should be designed so that it can\n   easily be partitioned\
    \ among the agencies that will assign names.  The\n   structure of names should\
    \ facilitate, rather than hinder, the mapping\n   function.  For example, it would\
    \ be hard to optimize the mapping\n   function if names were flat and unstructured.\n\
    \   3.2.  High-Speed Switching\n   The term \"high-speed switching\" refers to\
    \ changing the switching at a\n   high rate, rather than switching high-speed\
    \ links, because the latter\n   is not difficult at low speeds.  (Consider, for\
    \ example, manual\n   switching of fiber connections).  The switching regime chosen\
    \ for the\n   network determines various aspects of its performance, its charging\n\
    \   policies, and even its effective capabilities.  As an example of the\n   latter,\
    \ it is difficult to expect a circuit-switched network to\n   provide strong multicast\
    \ support.\n   A major area of debate lies in the choice between packet switching\n\
    \   and circuit switching.  This is a key research issue for the GN,\n   considering\
    \ also the possibility of there being combinations of the\n   two approaches that\
    \ are feasible.\n   3.2.1.  Unit of Management vs. Multiplexing\n   With very\
    \ high data rates, either the unit of management and\n   switching must be larger\
    \ or the speed of the processor elements for\n   management and switching must\
    \ be faster.  For example, at a gigabit,\n   a 576 byte packet takes roughly 5\
    \ microseconds to be received so a\n   packet switch must act extremely fast to\
    \ avoid being the dominant\n   delay in packet times.  Moreover, the storage time\
    \ for the packet in\n   a conventional store and forward implementation also becomes\
    \ a\n   significant component of the delay.  Thus, for packet switching to\n \
    \  remain attractive in this environment, it appears necessary to\n   increase\
    \ the size of packets (or switch on packet groups), do so-\n   called virtual\
    \ cut-through and use high-speed routing techniques,\n   such as high-speed route\
    \ caches and source routing.\n   Alternatively, for circuit switching to be attractive,\
    \ it must\n   provide very fast circuit setup and tear-down to support the bursty\n\
    \   nature of most computer communication.  This problem is rendered\n   difficult\
    \ (and perhaps impossible for certain traffic loads) because\n   the delay across\
    \ the country is so large relative to the data rate.\n   That is, even with techniques\
    \ such as so-called fast select,\n   bandwidth is reserved by the circuit along\
    \ the path for almost twice\n   the propagation time before being used.\n   With\
    \ gigabit circuit switching, because it is not feasible to\n   physically switch\
    \ channels, the low-level switching is likely doing\n   FTDM on micro-packets,\
    \ as is currently done in telephony.  Performing\n   FTDM at gigabit data rates\
    \ is a challenging research problem if the\n   skew introduced by wide-area communication\
    \ is to be handled with\n   reasonable overhead for spacing of this micro-packets.\
    \  Given the\n   lead and resources of the telephone companies, this area of\n\
    \   investigation should, if pursued, be pursued cooperatively.\n   3.2.2.  Bandwidth\
    \ Reservation Algorithms\n   Some applications, such as real-time video, require\
    \ sustained high\n   data rate streams over a significant period of time, such\
    \ as minutes\n   if not hours.  Intuitively, it is appealing for such applications\
    \ to\n   pre-allocate the bandwidth they require to minimize the switching\n \
    \  load on the network and guarantee that the required bandwidth is\n   available.\
    \  Research is required to determine the merits of bandwidth\n   reservation,\
    \ particular in conjunction with the different switching\n   technologies.  There\
    \ is some concern to raise that bandwidth\n   reservation may require excessive\
    \ intelligence in the network,\n   reducing the performance and reliability of\
    \ the network.  In\n   addition, bandwidth reservation opens a new option for\
    \ denial of\n   service by an intruder or malicious user.  Thus, investigations\
    \ in\n   this area need to proceed in concert with work on switching\n   technologies\
    \ and capabilities and security and reliability\n   requirements.\n   3.2.3. \
    \ Multicast Capabilities\n   It is now widely accepted that multicast should be\
    \ provided as a\n   user-level service, as described in RFC 1054 for IP, for example.\n\
    \   However, further research is required to determine the best way to\n   support\
    \ this facility at the network layer and lower.  It is fairly\n   clear that the\
    \ GN will be built from point-to-point fiber links that\n   do not provide multicast/broadcast\
    \ for free.  At the most\n   conservative extreme, one could provide no support\
    \ and require that\n   each host or gateway simulate multicast by sending multiple,\n\
    \   individually addressed packets.  However, there are significant\n   advantages\
    \ to providing very low level multicast support (besides the\n   obvious performance\
    \ advantages).  For example, multicast routing in a\n   flooding form provides\
    \ the most fault-tolerant, lowest-delay form of\n   delivery which, if reserved\
    \ for very high priority messages, provides\n   a good emergency facility for\
    \ high-stress network applications.\n   Multicast may also be useful as an approach\
    \ to defeat traffic\n   analysis.\n   Another key issue arises with the distinction\
    \ between so-called open\n   group multicast and closed group multicast.  In the\
    \ former, any host\n   can multicast to the group, whereas in the latter, only\
    \ members of\n   the group can multicast to it.  The latter is easier to support\
    \ and\n   adequate for conferencing, for example.  However, for more client-\n\
    \   server structured applications, such as using file/database server,\n   computation\
    \ servers, etc. as groups, open multicast is required.\n   Research is needed\
    \ to address both forms of multicast.  In addition,\n   security issues arise\
    \ in controlling the membership of multicast\n   groups.  This issue should be\
    \ addressed in concert with work on\n   secure forms of routing in general.\n\
    \   3.2.4.  Gateway Technologies\n   With the wide-area interconnection of local\
    \ networks by the GN,\n   gateways are expected to become a significant performance\
    \ bottleneck\n   unless significant advances are made in gateway performance.\
    \  In\n   addition, many network management concerns suggest putting more\n  \
    \ functionality (such as access control) in the gateways, further\n   increasing\
    \ their load and the need for greater capacity.  This would\n   then raise the\
    \ issue of the trade-off between general-purpose\n   hardware and special-purpose\
    \ hardware.\n   On the general-purpose side, it may be feasible to use a general-\n\
    \   purpose multiprocessor based on high-end microprocessors (perhaps as\n   exotic\
    \ as the GaAs MIPS) in conjunction with a high-speed block\n   transfer bus, as\
    \ proposed as part of the FutureBus standard (which is\n   extendible to higher\
    \ speeds than currently commercially planned) and\n   intelligent high-speed network\
    \ adaptors.  This would also allow the\n   direct use of hardware, operating systems,\
    \ and software tools\n   developed as part of other DARPA programs, such as Strategic\n\
    \   Computing.  It also appears to make this gateway software more\n   portable\
    \ to commercial machines as they become available in this\n   performance range.\n\
    \   The specialized hardware approach is based on the assumption that\n   general-purpose\
    \ hardware, particularly the interconnection bus,\n   cannot be fast enough to\
    \ support the level of performance required.\n   The expected emphasis is on various\
    \ interconnection network\n   techniques.  These approaches appear to require\
    \ greater expense, less\n   commercial availability and more specialized software.\
    \  They need to\n   be critically evaluated with respect to the general-purpose\
    \ gateway\n   hardware approach, especially if the latter is using multiple buses\n\
    \   for fault-tolerance as well as capacity extension (in the absence of\n   failure).\n\
    \   The same general-purpose vs. special-purpose contention is an issue\n   with\
    \ operating system software.  Conventionally, gateways run\n   specialized run-time\
    \ executives that are designed specifically for\n   the gateway and gateway functions.\
    \  However, the growing\n   sophistication of the gateway makes this approach\
    \ less feasible.  It\n   appears important to investigate the feasibility of using\
    \ a standard\n   operating system foundation on the gateways that is known to\
    \ provide\n   the required security and reliability properties (as well as real-\n\
    \   time performance properties).\n   3.2.5.  VLSI and Optronics Implementations\n\
    \   It appears fairly clear that gigabit communication will use fiber\n   optics\
    \ for at least the near future.  Without major advances in\n   optronics to allow\
    \ effectively for optical computers, communication\n   must cross the optical-electronic\
    \ boundary two or more times.  There\n   are significant cost, performance, reliability,\
    \ and security benefits\n   for minimizing the number of such crossings.  (As\
    \ an example of a\n   security benefit, optics is not prone to electronic surveillance\
    \ or\n   jamming while electronics clearly is, so replacing an optic-\n   electronic-optic\
    \ node with a pure optic node eliminates that\n   vulnerability point.)\n   The\
    \ benefits of improved technology in optronics is so great that its\n   application\
    \ here is purely another motivation for an already active\n   research area (that\
    \ deserves strong continued support).  Therefore,\n   we focus here in the issue\
    \ of matching current (and near-term\n   expected) optronics capabilities with\
    \ network requirements.\n   The first and perhaps greatest area of opportunity\
    \ is to achieve\n   totally (or largely) photonic switches in the network switching\n\
    \   nodes.  That is, most packets would be switched without crossing the\n   optics-electronics\
    \ boundary at all.  For this to be feasible, the\n   switch must use very simple\
    \ switching logic, require very little\n   storage and operate on packets of a\
    \ significant size.  The source-\n   routed packet switches with loopback on blockage\
    \ of Blazenet\n   illustrate the type of techniques that appear required to achieve\n\
    \   this goal.\n   Research is required to investigate the feasibility of optronic\n\
    \   implementation of switches.  It appears highly likely that networks\n   will\
    \ at some point in the future be totally photonically switched,\n   having the\
    \ impact on networking comparable to the effect of\n   integrated circuits on\
    \ processors and memories.\n   A next level of focus is to achieve optical switching\
    \ in the common\n   case in gateways.  One model is a multiprocessor with an optical\n\
    \   interconnect.  Packets associated with established paths through the\n   gateway\
    \ are optically switched and processed through the\n   interconnect.  Other packets\
    \ are routed to the multiprocessor,\n   crossing into the electronics domain.\
    \  Research is required to marry\n   the networking requirements and technology\
    \ with optronics technology,\n   pushing the state of the art in both areas in\
    \ the process.\n   Given the long-term presence of the optic-electronic boundary,\n\
    \   improvements in technology in this area are also important.  However,\n  \
    \ it appears that there is already enormous commercial research\n   activity in\
    \ this area, particularly within the telephone companies.\n   This is another\
    \ area in which collaborative investigation appears far\n   better than an new\
    \ independent research effort.\n   VLSI technology is an established technology\
    \ with active research\n   support.  The GN effort does not appear to require\
    \ major new\n   initiatives in the VLSI area, yet one should be open to significant\n\
    \   novel opportunities not identified here.\n   3.2.6.  High-Speed Transfer Protocols\n\
    \   To achieve the desired speeds, it will be necessary to rethink the\n   form\
    \ of protocols.\n      1.  The simple idea of a stateless gateway must be replaced\
    \ by a\n          more complex model in which the gateway understands the\n  \
    \        desired function of the end point and applies suitable\n          optimizations\
    \ to the flow.\n      2.  If multiplexing is done in the time domain, the elements\
    \ of\n          multiplexing are probably so small that no significant\n     \
    \     processing can be performed on each individually.  They must\n         \
    \ be processed as an aggregate.  This implies that the unit of\n          multiplexing\
    \ is not the same as the unit of processing.\n      3.  The interfaces between\
    \ the structural layers of the\n          communication system must change from\
    \ a simple\n          command/response style to a richer system which includes\n\
    \          indications and controls.\n      4.  An approach must be developed\
    \ that couples the memory\n          management in the host and the structure\
    \ of the transmitted\n          data, to allow efficient transfers into host memory.\n\
    \   The result of rethinking these problems will be a new style of\n   communications\
    \ and protocols, in which there is a much higher degree\n   of shared responsibility\
    \ among the components (hosts, switches,\n   gateways).  This may have little\
    \ resemblance to previous work either\n   in the DARPA or commercial communities.\n\
    \   3.3.  High-Speed Host Interfaces\n   As networks get faster, the most significant\
    \ bottleneck will turn out\n   to be the packet processing overhead in the host.\
    \  While this does\n   not restrict the aggregate rates we can achieve over trunks,\
    \ it\n   prevents delivery of high data rate flows to the host-based\n   applications,\
    \ which will prevent the development of new applications\n   needing high bandwidth.\
    \  The host bottleneck is thus a serious\n   impediment to networked use of supercomputers.\n\
    \   To build a GN we need to create new ways for hosts and their high\n   bandwidth\
    \ peripherals to connect to networks.  We believe that\n   pursuing research in\
    \ the ways to most effectively isolate host and\n   LAN development paths from\
    \ the GN is the most productive way to\n   proceed.  By decoupling the development\
    \ paths, neither is restricted\n   by the momentary performance of capability\
    \ bottlenecks of the other.\n   The best context in which to view this separation\
    \ is with the notion\n   of a network front end (NFE).  The NFE can take the electronic\
    \ input\n   data at many data rates and transform it into gigabit light data\n\
    \   appropriately packetized to traverse the GN.  The NFE can accept\n   inputs\
    \ from many types of gateways, hosts, host peripherals, and LANS\n   and provide\
    \ arbitration and path set-up facilities as needed.  Most\n   importantly, the\
    \ NFE can perform protocol arbitration to retain\n   upward compatibility with\
    \ the existing Internet protocols while\n   enabling those sophisticated network\
    \ input sources to execute GN\n   specific high-throughput protocols.  Of course,\
    \ this introduces the\n   need for research into high-speed NFEs to avoid the\
    \ NFE becoming a\n   bottleneck.\n   3.3.1.  VLSI and Optronics Implementations\n\
    \   In a host interface, unless the host is optical (an unlikely prospect\n  \
    \ in the near-term), the opportunities for optronic support are\n   limited. \
    \ In fact, with a serial-to-parallel conversion on reception\n   stepping the\
    \ clock rate down by a factor of 32 (assuming a 32-bit\n   data path on the host\
    \ interface), optronic speeds are not required in\n   the immediate future.\n\
    \   One exception may be for encryption.  Current VLSI implementations of\n  \
    \ standard encryption algorithms run in the 10 Mbit/s range.  Optronic\n   implementation\
    \ of these encryption techniques and encryption\n   techniques specifically oriented\
    \ to, or taking advantage of, optronic\n   capabilities appears to be an area\
    \ of some potential (and enormous\n   benefit if achieved).\n   The potential\
    \ of targeted VLSI research in this area appears limited\n   for similar reasons\
    \ discussed above with its application in high-\n   speed switching.  The major\
    \ benefits will arise from work that is\n   well-motivated by other research (such\
    \ as high-performance\n   parallelism) and by strong commercial interest.  Again,\
    \ we need to be\n   open to imaginative opportunities not foreseen here while\
    \ keeping\n   ourselves from being diverted into low-impact research without\n\
    \   further insights being put forward.\n   3.3.2.  High-Performance Transport\
    \ Protocols\n   Current transport protocols exhibit some severe problems for maximal\n\
    \   performance, especially for using hardware support.  For example, TCP\n  \
    \ places the checksum in the packet header, forcing the packet to be\n   formed\
    \ and read fully before transmission begins.  ISO TP4 is even\n   worse, locating\
    \ the checksum in a variable portion of the header at\n   an indeterminate offset,\
    \ making hardware implementation extremely\n   difficult.\n   The current Internet\
    \ has thrived and grown due to the existence of\n   TCP implementations for a\
    \ wide variety of classes of host computers.\n   These various TCP implementations\
    \ achieve robust interoperability by\n   a \"least common denominator\" approach\
    \ to features and options.  Some\n   applications have arisen in the current Internet,\
    \ and analogs can be\n   envisioned for the GN environment, which need qualities\
    \ of service\n   not generally supported by the ubiquitous generic TCP, and therefore\n\
    \   special purpose transport protocols have been developed.  Examples\n   include\
    \ special purpose transport protocols such as UDP (user\n   datagram protocol),\
    \ RDP (reliable datagram protocol), LDP\n   (loader/debugger protocol), NETBLT\
    \ (high-speed block transfer\n   protocol), NVP (network voice protocol) and PVP\
    \ (packet video\n   protocol).  Efforts are also under way to develop a new generic\n\
    \   transport protocol VMTP (versatile message transaction protocol)\n   which\
    \ will remedy some of deficiencies of TCP, without the need to\n   resort to special\
    \ purpose protocols for some applications.  Research\n   is needed in this area\
    \ to understand how transport level protocols\n   should be constructed for a\
    \ GN which provide adequate qualities of\n   service and ease of implementation.\n\
    \   A new transport protocol of reasonable success can be expected to\n   last\
    \ for ten years more.  Therefore, a new protocol should not be\n   over optimized\
    \ for current networks and must not ignore the\n   functional deficiencies of\
    \ current protocols.  These deficiencies are\n   essential to remedy before it\
    \ is feasible to deploy even current\n   distributed systems technology for military\
    \ and commercial\n   applications.\n   Forward Error Correction (FEC) is a useful\
    \ approach when the\n   bandwidth/delay ratio of the physical medium is high,\
    \ as can be\n   expected in transcontinental photonic links.  A degenerate form\
    \ of\n   FEC is to simply transmit multiple copies of the data; this allows\n\
    \   one to trade bandwidth for delay and reliability, without requiring\n   much\
    \ intelligence.  In fact, it is generally true that reliability,\n   bandwidth,\
    \ and delay are interrelated and an improvement in one\n   generally comes at\
    \ the expense of the others for a given technology.\n   Research is required to\
    \ find appropriate operating points in networks\n   using transmission components\
    \ which offer extremely high bandwidth\n   with very good bit-error-rate performance.\n\
    \   3.3.3.  Network Adaptors\n   With the promised speed of networks, the future\
    \ network adaptor must\n   be viewed as a memory interconnect, tying the memory\
    \ in one host to\n   another, at least if the data rate and the low latency made\
    \ possible\n   by the network is to be realized at the host-to-host or process-to-\n\
    \   process level.  The challenge is too great to be met by just\n   implementing\
    \ protocols in custom VLSI.\n   Research is required to investigate the impact\
    \ of network\n   interconnection on a machine architecture and to define and evaluate\n\
    \   new network adaptor architectures.  Of key importance is integration\n   of\
    \ network adaptor into the operating system so that process-to-\n   process communications\
    \ performance matches that offered by the\n   network.  In particular, we conjecture\
    \ that the transport level will\n   be implemented largely, if not entirely, in\
    \ the network adaptor,\n   providing the host with reliable memory-to-memory transfer\
    \ at memory\n   speeds with a minimum of interrupt processing bus overhead and\
    \ packet\n   processing.\n   Drawing an analogy to RISC technology again, maximal\
    \ performance\n   requires a well-designed and coordinated protocol, software,\
    \ and\n   hardware (network adaptor) design.  Current standard protocols are\n\
    \   significantly flawed for hardware compatibility, suggesting a need\n   for\
    \ considerable further research on high-performance protocol\n   design.\n   3.3.4.\
    \  Host Operating System Software\n   Conventionally, communication has been an\
    \ add-on to an operating\n   system.  With the GN, the network may well become\
    \ the fastest\n   \"peripheral\" connected to most nodes.  High-performance process-to-\n\
    \   process (or application to application) communication will not be\n   achieved\
    \ until the operating system is well designed for fast access\n   to and from\
    \ the network.  For example, incorporating templates of the\n   network packet\
    \ header directly in the process descriptor may allow a\n   process to initiate\
    \ communications with minimal overhead.  Similarly,\n   memory mapping can be\
    \ used to eliminate copies between data arriving\n   from the network and it being\
    \ delivered to the applications.  With a\n   GN, an extra copy forced by the operating\
    \ system may easily double\n   the perceived transfer time for a packet between\
    \ applications.\n   Besides matching data transfer mechanisms, operating systems\
    \ must be\n   well-matched in security design to that supported by the host\n\
    \   interface and network as well.  Otherwise, all but the most trivial\n   additional\
    \ security actions by the operating system in common case\n   communication can\
    \ easily eliminate the performance benefits of the\n   GN.  For example, if the\
    \ host has to do further encryption or\n   decryption, the throughput is likely\
    \ to be at least halved and the\n   latency doubled.\n   Research effort is required\
    \ to further refine operating systems for\n   the level of performance offered\
    \ by the GN.  This effort may well be\n   best realized with coupling existing\
    \ efforts in distributed systems\n   with the GN activities, as opposed to starting\
    \ new separate efforts.\n   3.4.  Advanced Network Management Algorithms\n   An\
    \ important emphasis for research into network management should be\n   on decentralized\
    \ approaches.  The ratio of propagation delay across\n   the country to data rates\
    \ in a GN appear to be too great to deal\n   effectively with resource management\
    \ centrally when traffic load is\n   bursty and unstable (and if it is not, one\
    \ might argue there is no\n   problem).  In addition, important principles of\
    \ fault containment and\n   minimal privilege for reliability and security suggest\
    \ that a\n   centralized management approach is infeasible.  In particular,\n\
    \   compromising the security of one portion of the network should not\n   compromise\
    \ the security of the whole network.  Similarly, a failure\n   or fault should\
    \ affect at most a local region of the network.\n   The challenge is clearly to\
    \ provide decentralized management\n   techniques that lead to good global behavior\
    \ in the normal case and\n   acceptable behavior in expected worst-case failures,\
    \ traffic\n   variations and security intrusions.\n   3.4.1.  Control Flow vs.\
    \ Data Flow\n   Network operational communications can be separated into flow\
    \ of user\n   data and flow of management/control data.  However, the user data\n\
    \   must contain some amount of control data.  One question that needs to\n  \
    \ be explored in light of changes in communications and computing costs\n   and\
    \ performance is the trade-off between these two flows.  An example\n   of a potential\
    \ approach is to use data units which contain predefined\n   path indicators.\
    \  The switch can perform a simple table look-up which\n   maps the path indicator\
    \ onto the preferred outbound link and\n   transmits the packet immediately. \
    \ There is a path set-up packet\n   which fills in the appropriate tables.  Path\
    \ set-up occurs before the\n   first data packet flows and then, while data is\
    \ flowing, to improve\n   the routes during the lifetime of the connection.  This\
    \ concept has\n   been discussed in the Internet engineering group under the name\
    \ of\n   soft connections.\n   We note that separating the data flow from the\
    \ control flow in the GN\n   has security and reliability advantages as well.\
    \  We could encrypt\n   most of the packet header to provide confidentiality within\
    \ the GN\n   and to limit the ability of intruders to perform traffic analysis.\n\
    \   And, by separating the control flow, we can encrypt all the control\n   exchanges\
    \ between switches and the host front ends thereby offering\n   confidentiality\
    \ and integrity.  No unauthorized entity will be able\n   to alter or examine\
    \ the control traffic.  By employing a path set-up\n   procedure, we can assure\
    \ that the GN NFE-to-NFE path is functioning\n   and also include user-specific\
    \ requirements in the route.  For\n   example, we could request a certain bandwidth\
    \ allocation and simplify\n   the job of the switches in handling flow control.\
    \  We could also set\n   up backup paths in case the output link will be busy\
    \ for so many\n   microseconds that the packet cannot be stored until the link\
    \ is\n   freed.\n   3.4.2.  Resource Management Algorithms\n   Most current networks\
    \ deliver one quality of service.  X.25 networks\n   deliver a reliable byte-stream.\
    \  Most LANs deliver a best-effort\n   unreliable service.  There are few networks\
    \ today that can support\n   multiple types of service, and allocate their resources\
    \ among them.\n   Indeed, for many networks, such as best-effort unreliable service,\n\
    \   there is little management of resources at all.  The next generation\n   of\
    \ network will require a much more controlled allocation of\n   resources.\n \
    \  There will be a much wider range of desired types of service, with\n   current\
    \ services such as remote procedure call mixing with new\n   services such as\
    \ video streams.  Unless these are separately\n   recognized and controlled, there\
    \ is little reason to believe that\n   effective service can be delivered unless\
    \ the network is very lightly\n   loaded.\n   In order to support multiple types\
    \ of service, two things must\n   happen, both a change from current practice.\
    \  First, the application\n   must describe to the network what type of service\
    \ is required.\n   Second, the network must use this information to make resource\n\
    \   allocation decisions.  Both of these practices present difficulties.\n   Past\
    \ experience suggests that application code is not prepared to\n   know or specify\
    \ what service it needs.  By custom, operating systems\n   provide a virtual world,\
    \ and the applications in this world are\n   unaware of the relation between this\
    \ and the reality of time and\n   space.  Resource requests must be in real terms.\
    \  Allocation of\n   resources in the network is difficult, because it requires\
    \ that\n   decisions be made in the network, but as network packet throughput\n\
    \   increases, there is less time for decisions.\n   The resolution of this latter\
    \ conflict is to observe that decisions\n   must be made on larger units than\
    \ the unit of multiplexing such as\n   the packet.  This in turn implies that\
    \ packets must be visible to the\n   network as being part of a sequence, as opposed\
    \ to the pure datagram\n   model previously exploited.  As suggested earlier in\
    \ this report,\n   research is required to support this more complex form of switch\n\
    \   without compromising robustness.\n   To permit the application to specify\
    \ the service it needs, it will be\n   necessary to propose some abstraction of\
    \ service class.  By clever\n   design of this abstraction, it should be possible\
    \ to allow the\n   application to describe its needs effectively.  For example,\
    \ an\n   application such as file transfer or mail has two modes of operation;\n\
    \   bulk data transfer and remote procedure call.  The application may\n   not\
    \ be able to predict when it will be in which mode, but if it just\n   describes\
    \ both of them, the system may be able to adapt by observing\n   its current operation.\n\
    \   Experimentation needs to be done to determine a suitable service\n   specification\
    \ interface.  This experimentation could be done in the\n   context of the current\
    \ protocols, and could thus be undertaken at\n   once.\n   3.4.3.  Adaptive Protocols\n\
    \   Network operating conditions can vary quickly and over a wide range.\n   This\
    \ is true of the current Internet, and is likely to affect the GN\n   too.  Protocols\
    \ that can adapt to changing circumstances would\n   provide more even and robust\
    \ service than is currently possible.  For\n   example, when error rates increased,\
    \ a protocol implementation might\n   decide to use smaller packets, thus reducing\
    \ the burden caused by\n   retransmissions.\n   The environment in which a protocol\
    \ operates can be described in\n   terms of the service it is getting from the\
    \ next lower layer.  A\n   protocol implementation can adapt to changes in that\
    \ service by\n   tuning its internal mechanisms (time-outs, retransmission strategies,\n\
    \   etc.).  Therefore, to design adaptive protocols, we must understand\n   the\
    \ interaction between protocol layers and the mechanisms used\n   within them.\
    \  There has been some work done in this area.  For\n   example, the SATNET measurement\
    \ task force has looked at the\n   interactions between the protocol used by the\
    \ SIMP, IP, and TCP.\n   What is needed is a more complete characterization of\
    \ the\n   interactions at various layer boundaries, and the development of\n \
    \  appropriate protocol designs and mechanisms to provide for necessary\n   adaptations\
    \ and renegotiations.\n   3.4.4.  Error Recovery Mechanisms\n   Being large and\
    \ complex, GNs will experience a variety of faults such\n   as link or nodal failure,\
    \ excessive buffer overflow due to faulty\n   flow and congestion control, and\
    \ partial failure of switching fabric.\n   These failures, which also exist in\
    \ today's networks, will have a\n   stronger effect in GNs where a large amount\
    \ of data will be \"stored\"\n   in transit and, to expedite the switching, nodes\
    \ will apply only\n   minimal processing to the packets traversing them.  In source\n\
    \   routing, for example, a link failure may cause the loss of all\n   packets\
    \ sent until the source is notified about the change in\n   topology.  The longer\
    \ is the delay in recovering from failures, the\n   higher is the degradation\
    \ in performance observed by the users.\n   To minimize the effects of failures,\
    \ GNs will need to employ error\n   recovery mechanisms whereby the network detects\
    \ failures and error\n   conditions, reconfigures itself to adapt to the new network\
    \ state,\n   and notifies peripheral devices of the new configuration.  Such\n\
    \   protocols, which have to be developed, will respond quickly, will be\n   decentralized\
    \ or distributed to minimize the possibility of fatal\n   failures, and will complement,\
    \ rather than replicate, the error\n   correction mechanisms of the end-to-end\
    \ protocols, and the two must\n   operate in coordinated manner.  To this end,\
    \ the peripheral devices\n   will have to be knowledgeable about the intranet\
    \ recovery mechanisms\n   and interact continuously with them to minimize the\
    \ effect on the\n   connections they manage.\n   3.4.5.  Flow Control\n   As networks\
    \ become faster, two related problems arise.  First,\n   existing flow control\
    \ mechanisms such as windows do not work well,\n   because the window must be\
    \ opened to such an extent to achieve\n   desired bandwidth that effective flow\
    \ control cannot be achieved.\n   Second, especially for long-haul networks, the\
    \ larger number of bits\n   in transit at one time becomes so large that most\
    \ computer messages\n   will fit into one window.  This means that traditional\
    \ congestion\n   control schemes will cease to work well.\n   What is needed is\
    \ a combination of two approaches, both new.  First,\n   for messages that are\
    \ small (most messages generated by computers\n   today will be small, since they\
    \ will fit into one round-trip time of\n   future networks), open-loop controls\
    \ on flow and congestion are\n   needed.  For longer messages (voice or video\
    \ streams, for example),\n   some explicit resource commitment will be required.\n\
    \   3.4.6.  Latency Control and Real-Time Operations\n   Currently, there are\
    \ several distinct approaches to latency control.\n   First, there are some networks\
    \ which are physically short, more like\n   multiprocessor buses.  Applications\
    \ in these networks are built\n   assuming that delays will be short.\n   Second,\
    \ there are networks where the physical length is not\n   constrained by the design\
    \ and may differ by orders of magnitude,\n   depending on the scope of the network.\
    \  Most general purpose networks\n   fall in this category.  In these networks,\
    \ one of two things happens.\n   Either the application takes special steps to\
    \ deal with variable\n   latency, such as echo suppression in voice networks,\
    \ or these\n   applications are not supported.\n   For most applications today,\
    \ the latency in the network is not an\n   obvious issue so long as the network\
    \ is not overloaded (which leads\n   to losses and long queues), because the protocol\
    \ overhead masks the\n   variation in the network latency.  This balance will\
    \ change.  The\n   latency due to the speed of light will obviously remain the\
    \ same, but\n   the overhead will drop (of necessity if we are to achieve high\n\
    \   performance) which will leave speed of light and queueing as the most\n  \
    \ critical sources of delay.\n   This conclusion implies that if queueing delay\
    \ can be controlled, it\n   will be possible to build networks with stable and\
    \ controlled\n   latency.  If applications exist that require this class of service,\n\
    \   it can be supported.  Either the network must be underloaded, so that\n  \
    \ queues do not develop at all, or a specific class of service must be\n   supported\
    \ in which resources are allocated to stabilize the delay.\n   If this service\
    \ is provided, it will still leave the application with\n   delays that can vary\
    \ by several orders of magnitude, depending on the\n   physical size of the network.\
    \  Research at the application level will\n   be required to see how applications\
    \ can be designed to cope with this\n   variation.\n   3.4.7.  High-Speed Internetworking\
    \ and Administrational Domains\n   Internetworking recognized that the value of\
    \ communication services\n   increases significantly with wider interconnection\
    \ but ignored\n   management and the role of administrations.  As a consequence\
    \ we see\n   that:\n      1.  The Internet is more or less unmanageable, as evidenced\
    \ by\n          performance, reliability, and security problems.\n      2.  The\
    \ Internet is being stressed by administrators that are\n          building networks\
    \ to match their organization rather than the\n          geography.  An example\
    \ is a set of Ethernets at different\n          company locations operating as\
    \ a single Internet network but\n          geographically dispersed and connected\
    \ by satellite or leased\n          lines.\n   The next generation of internetworking\
    \ must focus on administration\n   and management.  Internetworking must support\
    \ cohesion within an\n   administration and a healthy separation between administrations.\
    \  To\n   illustrate by analogy, the American and Soviet embassies in Mexico\n\
    \   City are geographically closer to each other than to their respective\n  \
    \ home countries but further in administrational distance, including\n   security,\
    \ accounting, etc.  The emerging revolution in WANs makes\n   this issue that\
    \ much more critical.  The amount of communication to\n   exchange the state of\
    \ systems is bound to increase enormously.  The\n   potential cost of failures\
    \ and security violations is frightening.\n   A promising approach appears to\
    \ be high-level gateways that guard\n   between administrations and require negotiations\
    \ to set up access\n   paths between administrations.  These paths are set up,\
    \ and labeled\n   with agreements on authorization, security, accounting, and\
    \ possible\n   resource limits.  These administrative virtual circuits provide\n\
    \   transparency to the physical and geographical interconnection, but\n   need\
    \ not support more than datagram packet delivery.  One view is\n   that of communication\
    \ contracts with high-level gateways acting as\n   contract monitors at each end.\
    \  The key is the focus on controlled\n   interadministrational connectivity,\
    \ not the conventional protocol\n   concerns.\n   Focus is required on developing\
    \ an (inter)network management\n   architecture and the specifics of high-level\
    \ gateways.  The\n   structures of such gateways will have to take advantage of\
    \ advances\n   in multi-processor architectures to handle the processing load.\n\
    \   Moreover, a key issue is being able to optimize communication between\n  \
    \ administrations once the contract is in place, but without losing\n   control.\
    \  Related is the issue of allowing high-speed interconnection\n   within a single\
    \ administration, although geographical dispersed.\n   Another issue is fault-tolerance.\
    \  High-level gateways contain state\n   information whose loss typically disrupts\
    \ communication.  How does\n   one minimize this problem?\n   A key goal of these\
    \ administrational gateways has to be failure\n   containment: How to protect\
    \ against external (to administration)\n   problems and how to prevent local problems\
    \ imposing liability on\n   others.  A particular area of concern is the self-organizing\
    \ problems\n   of large-scale systems, observed by Van Jacobson in the Internet.\n\
    \   Gateways must serve to damp out oscillations and control wide load\n   swings.\
    \  Rate control appears to be a key area to investigate as a\n   basis for buffer\
    \ management and for congestion control, as well as to\n   control offered load.\n\
    \   Given the speed of new networks, and the sophistication of the\n   gateways\
    \ suggested above, another key area to investigate is the\n   provision of high-speed\
    \ network interface adaptors.\n   3.4.8.  Policy-Based Algorithms\n   Networks\
    \ of today generally select routes based on minimizing some\n   measure such as\
    \ delay.  However, in the real world, route selection\n   will commonly be constrained\
    \ at the global level by policy issues,\n   such as access rights to resources\
    \ and accounting and billing for\n   usage.\n   It is difficult for connectionless\
    \ protocols such as Internet to deal\n   with policy controls, because a lack\
    \ of state in the gateway implies\n   that a separate policy decision must be\
    \ made for each packet in\n   isolation.  As networks get faster, the cost of\
    \ this processing will\n   be intolerable.  One possible approach, discussed above,\
    \ is to move\n   to a more sophisticated model in which there is knowledge in\
    \ the\n   gateways of the ongoing flows.  Alternatively, it may be possible to\n\
    \   design gateways that simply cache recent policy evaluations and apply\n  \
    \ them to successive packets.\n   Routing based on policy is particularly difficult\
    \ because a route\n   must be globally consistent to be useful; otherwise it may\
    \ loop.\n   This implies that the every policy decision must be propagated\n \
    \  globally.  Since there can be expected to be a large number of\n   policies,\
    \ this global passing of information might easily lead to an\n   information explosion.\n\
    \   There are at least two solutions.  One is to restrict the possible\n   classes\
    \ of policy.  Another is to use some form of source route, so\n   that the route\
    \ consistent with some set of policies is computed at\n   one point only, and\
    \ then attached to the packet.  Both of these\n   approaches have problems.  A\
    \ two-pronged research program is needed,\n   in which mechanisms are proposed,\
    \ and at the same time the needed\n   policies are defined.\n   The same trade-off\
    \ can be seen for accounting and billing.  A single\n   accounting metric, such\
    \ as \"bytes times distance\", could be proposed.\n   This might be somewhat simple\
    \ to implement, but would not permit the\n   definition of individual billing\
    \ policies, as is now done in the\n   parts of the telephone system.  The current\
    \ connectionless transport\n   architectures such as TCP/IP or the connectionless\
    \ ISO configuration\n   using TP4 do not have good tools for accounting for traffic,\
    \ or for\n   restricting traffic from certain resources.  Building these tools\
    \ is\n   difficult in a connectionless environment, because an accounting or\n\
    \   control facility must deal with each packet in isolation, which\n   implies\
    \ a significant processing burden as part of packet forwarding.\n   This burden\
    \ is an increasing problem as switches are expected to\n   operate faster.\n \
    \  The lack of these tools is proving a significant problem for network\n   design.\
    \  Not only are accounting and control needed to support\n   management requirements,\
    \ they are needed as a building block to\n   support enforcement of such things\
    \ as multiple qualities of service,\n   as discussed above.\n   Network accounting\
    \ is generally considered to be simply a step that\n   leads to billing, and thus\
    \ is often evaluated in terms of how simple\n   or difficult it will be to implement.\
    \  Yet an accounting and billing\n   procedure is a mechanism for implementing\
    \ a policy considered to be\n   desirable for reasons beyond the scope of accounting\
    \ per se.  For\n   example, a policy might be established either to encourage\
    \ or\n   discourage network use, while fully recovering operational cost.  A\n\
    \   policy of encouraging use could be implemented by a relatively high\n   monthly\
    \ attachment charge and a relatively low per-packet charge.  A\n   policy of discouraging\
    \ use could be implemented by a low monthly\n   charge and a high per-packet charge.\n\
    \   Network administrators have a relatively small number of variables\n   with\
    \ which to implement policy objectives.  Nevertheless, these\n   variables can\
    \ be combined in a number of innovative ways.  Some of\n   the possibilities include:\n\
    \      1.  Classes of users (e.g., large or small institutions, for-\n       \
    \   profit or non-profit).\n      2.  Classes of service.\n      3.  Time varying\
    \ (e.g., peak and off-peak).\n      4.  Volume (e.g., volume discounts, or volume\
    \ surcharges).\n      5.  Access charges (e.g., per port, or port * [bandwidth\
    \ of\n          port]).\n      6.  Distance (e.g., circuit-miles, airline miles,\
    \ number of hops).\n   Generally, an accounting procedure can be developed to\
    \ support\n   voluntary user cooperation with almost any single policy objective.\n\
    \   Difficulties most often arise when there are multiple competing\n   policy\
    \ objectives, or when there is no clear policy at all.\n   Another aspect of accounting\
    \ and billing procedures which must be\n   carefully considered is the cost of\
    \ accumulating and processing the\n   data on which billing is based.  Of particular\
    \ concern is collection\n   of detailed data on a per-packet basis.  As network\
    \ circuit data\n   rates increase, the number of instructions which must be executed\
    \ on\n   a per-packet basis can become the limiting factor in system\n   throughput.\
    \  Thus, it may be appropriate to prefer accounting and\n   billing policies and\
    \ procedures which minimize the difficulty of\n   collecting data, even if this\
    \ approach requires a compromise of other\n   objectives.  Similarly, node memory\
    \ required for data collection and\n   any network bandwidth required for transmission\
    \ of the data to\n   administrative headquarters are factors which must be traded\
    \ off\n   against the need to process user packets.\n   3.4.9.  Priority and Preemption\n\
    \   The GN should support multiple levels of priority for traffic and the\n  \
    \ preemption of network resources for higher priority use.  Network\n   control\
    \ traffic should be given the highest priority to ensure that\n   it is able to\
    \ pass through the network unimpeded by congestion caused\n   by user-level traffic.\
    \  There may be additional military uses for\n   multiple levels of priority which\
    \ correspond to rank or level of\n   importance of a user or the mission criticality\
    \ of some particular\n   data.\n   The use of and existence of priority levels\
    \ may be different for\n   different types of traffic.  For example, datagram\
    \ traffic may not\n   have multiple priority levels.  Because the network's transmission\n\
    \   speed is so high and traffic bursts may be short, it may not make\n   sense\
    \ to do any processing in the switches to deal with different\n   priority levels.\
    \  Priority will be more important for flow- (or\n   soft-connection-) oriented\
    \ data or hard connections in terms of\n   permitting higher priority connections\
    \ to be set up ahead of lower\n   priority connections.  Preemption will permit\
    \ requests for high\n   priority connections to reclaim network resources currently\
    \ in use by\n   lower priority traffic.\n   Networks such as the Wideband Satellite\
    \ Network, which supports\n   datagram and stream traffic, implement four priority\
    \ levels for\n   traffic with the highest reserved for network control functions\
    \ and\n   the other three for user traffic.  The Wideband Network supports\n \
    \  preemption of lower priority stream allocations by higher priority\n   requests.\
    \  An important component of the use of priority and\n   preemption is the ability\
    \ to notify users when requests for service\n   have been denied, or allocations\
    \ have been modified or disrupted.\n   Such mechanisms have been implemented in\
    \ the Wideband Network for\n   streams and dynamic multicast groups.\n   Priority\
    \ and preemption mechanisms for a GN will have to be\n   implemented in an extremely\
    \ simple way so that they can take effect\n   very quickly.  It is likely that\
    \ they will have to built into the\n   hardware of the switch fabric.\n   3.5.\
    \  User and Network Services\n   As discussed in Section 2 above, there will need\
    \ to be certain\n   services provided as part of the network operation to the\
    \ users\n   (people) themselves and to the machines that connect to the network.\n\
    \   These services, which include such capabilities as white and yellow\n   pages\
    \ (allowing users to determine what the appropriate network\n   identification\
    \ is for other users and for network-available computing\n   resources) and distributed\
    \ fault identification and isolation, are\n   needed in current networks and will\
    \ continue to be required in the\n   networks of the future.  The speed of the\
    \ GN will serve to accentuate\n   this requirement, but at the same time will\
    \ allow for new\n   architectures to be put in place for such services.  For example,\n\
    \   Ethernet speeds in the local environment have allowed for more usable\n  \
    \ services to be provided.\n   3.5.1.  Impact of High Bandwidth\n   One issue\
    \ that will need to be addressed is the impact on the user of\n   such high-bandwidth\
    \ capabilities.  Users are already becoming\n   saturated by information in the\
    \ modern information-rich environment.\n   (Many of us receive more than 50 electronic\
    \ mail messages each day,\n   each requiring some degree of human attention.)\
    \ Methods will be\n   needed to allow users to cope with this ever-expanding access\
    \ to\n   data, or we will run the risk of users turning back to the relative\n\
    \   peace and quiet of the isolated office.\n   3.5.2.  Distributed Network Directory\n\
    \   A distributed network directory can support the user-level directory\n   services\
    \ and the lower-level name-to-address mapping services\n   described elsewhere\
    \ in this report.  It can also support distributed\n   systems and network management\
    \ facilities by storing additional\n   information about named objects.  For example,\
    \ the network directory\n   might store node configurations or security levels.\n\
    \   Distributing the directory eases and decentralizes the administrative\n  \
    \ burdens and provides a more robust and survivable implementation.\n   One approach\
    \ toward implementing a distributed network directory\n   would be to base it\
    \ upon the CCITT X.500/ISO DIS 9594 standard.  This\n   avoids starting from ground\
    \ zero and has the advantage of\n   facilitating interoperability with other communications\
    \ networks.\n   However, research and development will be required even if this\
    \ path\n   is chosen.\n   One area in which research and development are required\
    \ is in the\n   services supplied by the distributed network directory.  The X.500\n\
    \   standard is very general and powerful, but so far specific provisions\n  \
    \ have been made only for storing information about network users and\n   applications.\
    \  As mentioned elsewhere, multilevel security is not\n   addressed by X.500,\
    \ and the approach taken toward authentication must\n   be carefully considered\
    \ in view of DoD requirements.  Also, X.500\n   assumes that administration of\
    \ the directory will be done locally and\n   without the need for standardization;\
    \ this may not be true of GN or\n   the larger national research network.\n  \
    \ The model and algorithms used by a distributed network directory\n   constitute\
    \ a second area of research.  The model specified by X.500\n   must be extended\
    \ into a framework that provides the necessary\n   flexibility in terms of services,\
    \ responsiveness, data management\n   policies, and protocol layer utilization.\
    \  Furthermore, the internal\n   algorithms and mechanisms of X.500 must be extended\
    \ in a number of\n   areas; for example, to support redundancy of the X.500 database,\n\
    \   internal consistency checking, fuller sharing of information about\n   the\
    \ distribution of data, and defined access-control mechanisms.\n   4.  Avenues\
    \ of Approach\n   Ongoing research and commercial activities provide an opportunity\
    \ for\n   more rapidly attacking some of the above research issues.  At the\n\
    \   same time, there needs to be attention paid to the overall technical\n   approach\
    \ used to allow multiple potential solutions to be explored\n   and allow issues\
    \ to be attacked in parallel.\n   4.1.  Small Prototype vs. Nationwide Network\n\
    \   The central question is how far to jump, and how far can the current\n   approaches\
    \ get.  That is, how far will connectionless network service\n   get us, how far\
    \ will packet switching get us, and how far do we want\n   to go.  If our goal\
    \ is a Gbit/s net, then that is what we should\n   build.  Building a 100 Mbit/s\
    \ network to achieve a GN is analogous to\n   climbing a tree to get to the moon.\
    \  It may get you closer, but it\n   will never get you there.\n   There are currently\
    \ some network designs which can serve as the basis\n   for a GN prototype.  The\
    \ next step is some work by experts in\n   photonics and possibly high-speed electronics\
    \ to explore ease of\n   implementation.  Developing a prototype 3-5 node network\
    \ at a Gbit/s\n   data rate is realistic at this point and would demonstrate wide-area\n\
    \   (40 km or more) Gbit/s networking.\n   DARPA should consider installing a\
    \ Gbit/s cross-country set of\n   connected links analogous to the NSF backbone\
    \ in 2 years.  A Gbit/s\n   link between the east and west coasts would open up\
    \ a whole new\n   generation of (C3I), distributed computing, and parallel computing\n\
    \   research possibilities and would reestablish DARPA as the premier\n   network\
    \ research funding agency in the country.  This will require\n   getting \"dark\"\
    \ fiber from one or more of the common carriers and some\n   collaboration with\
    \ these organizations on repeaters, etc.  With this\n   collaboration, the time\
    \ to a commercial network in the Gbit/s range\n   would be substantially reduced,\
    \ and the resulting nationwide GN would\n   give the United States an enormous\
    \ technical and economic advantage\n   over countries without it.\n   Demonstrating\
    \ a high-bandwidth WAN is not enough, however.  As one\n   can see from the many\
    \ research issues identified above, it will be\n   necessary to pursue via study\
    \ and experiment the issues involved in\n   interconnecting high-bandwidth networks\
    \ into a high-bandwidth\n   internet.  These experiments can be done through use\
    \ of a new\n   generation of internet, even if it requires starting at lower speeds\n\
    \   (e.g., T1 through 100 Mbit/s).  Appropriate care must be given,\n   however,\
    \ to assure that the capabilities that are demonstrated are\n   applicable to\
    \ the higher bandwidths (Gbit/s) as they emerge.\n   4.2.  Need for Parallel Efforts/Approaches\n\
    \   Parallel efforts will therefore be required for two major reasons.\n   First\
    \ is the need to pursue alternative approaches (e.g., different\n   strategies\
    \ for high-bandwidth switching, different addressing\n   techniques, etc).  This\
    \ is the case for most research programs, but\n   it is made more difficult here\
    \ by the costs of prototyping.  Thus, it\n   is necessary that appropriate review\
    \ take place in the decisions as\n   to which efforts are supported through prototyping.\n\
    \   In addition, it will be necessary to pursue the different aspects of\n   the\
    \ program in parallel.  It will not be possible to wait until the\n   high-bandwidth\
    \ network is available before starting on prototyping\n   the high-bandwidth internet.\
    \  Thus, a phased and evolutionary\n   approach will be needed.\n   4.3.  Collaboration\
    \ with Common Carriers\n   Computer communication networks in the United States\
    \ today\n   practically ignore the STN (the Switched Telephone Network), except\n\
    \   for buying raw bandwidth through it.  However, advances in network\n   performance\
    \ are based on improvements in the underlying communication\n   media, including\
    \ satellite communication, fiber optics, and photonic\n   switching.\n   In the\
    \ past we used \"their\" transmission under \"our\" switching.  An\n   alternative\
    \ approach is to utilize the common-carrier switching\n   capabilities as an integral\
    \ part of the networking architecture.  We\n   must take an objective scientific\
    \ and economic look and reevaluate\n   this question.\n   Another place for cooperation\
    \ with the common carriers is in the area\n   of network addressing.  Their addressing\
    \ scheme (\"numbering plan\")\n   has a few advantages such as proven service\
    \ to 300 million users [4].\n   On the other hand, the common carriers have far\
    \ fewer administrative\n   domains (area codes) than the current plethora of locally\n\
    \   administered local area networks in the internet system.\n   It is likely\
    \ that future networks will eventually be managed and\n   operated by commercial\
    \ communications providers.  A way to maximize\n   technology transfer from the\
    \ research discussed here to the\n   marketplace is to involve the potential carriers\
    \ from the start.\n   However, it is not clear that the goals of commercial communications\n\
    \   providers, who have typically been most interested in meeting the\n   needs\
    \ of 90+ percent of the user base, will be compatible with the\n   goals of the\
    \ research described here.  Thus, while we recommend that\n   the research program\
    \ involve an appropriate amalgam of academia and\n   industry, paying particular\
    \ attention to involvement of the potential\n   system developers and operators,\
    \ we also caution that the specific\n   and unique goals of the DARPA program\
    \ must be retained.\n   4.4.  Technology Transfer\n   As we said above, it is\
    \ our belief that future networks will\n   ultimately be managed and operated\
    \ by commercial communications\n   providers.  (Note that this may not be the\
    \ common carriers as we know\n   them today, but may be value-added networks using\
    \ common carrier\n   facilities.) The way to assure technology transfer, in our\
    \ belief, is\n   to involve the potential system developers from the start.  We\n\
    \   therefore believe that the research program would benefit from an\n   appropriate\
    \ amalgam of university and industry, with provision for\n   close involvement\
    \ of the potential system developers and operators.\n   4.5.  Standards\n   The\
    \ Internet program was a tremendous success in influencing national\n   and international\
    \ standards.  While there were changes to the\n   protocols, the underlying technology\
    \ and approaches used by CCITT and\n   ISO in the standardization of packet-switched\
    \ networks clearly had\n   its roots in the DARPA internet.  Nevertheless, this\
    \ has had some\n   negative impact on the research program, as the evolution of\
    \ the\n   standards led to pressure to adopt them in the research environment.\n\
    \   Thus, it appears that there is a \"catch-22\" here.  It is desirable\n   for\
    \ the technology base developed in the research program to have\n   maximal impact\
    \ on the standards activities.  This is expedited by\n   doing the research in\
    \ the context of the standards environment.\n   However, standards by their very\
    \ nature will always lag behind the\n   research environment.\n   The only reasonable\
    \ approach, therefore, appears to be an occasional\n   \"checkpointing\" of the\
    \ research environment, where the required\n   conversions take place to allow\
    \ a new plateau of standards to be used\n   for future evolution and research.\
    \  A good example is conducting\n   future research in mail using X.400 and X.500\
    \ where possible.\n   5.  Conclusions\n   We hope that this document has provided\
    \ a useful compendium of those\n   research issues critical to achieving the FCCSET\
    \ phase III\n   recommendations.  These problems interact in a complex way.  If\
    \ the\n   only goal of a new network architecture was high speed, reasonable\n\
    \   solutions would not be difficult to propose.  But if one must achieve\n  \
    \ higher speeds while supporting multiple services, and at the same\n   time support\
    \ the establishment of these services across\n   administrative boundaries, so\
    \ that policy concerns (e.g., access\n   control) must be enforced, the interactions\
    \ become complex.\n                                 APPENDIX\n"

  - "A. Current R and D Activities\n   In this appendix, we provide pointers to some\
    \ ongoing activities in\n   the research and development community of which the\
    \ group was aware\n   relevant to the goal of achieving the GN.  In some cases,\
    \ a short\n   abstract is provided of the research.  Neither the order of the\n\
    \   listing (which is random) nor the amount of detail provided is meant\n   to\
    \ indicate in any way the significance of the activity.  We hope\n   that this\
    \ set of pointers will be useful to anyone who chooses to\n   pursue the research\
    \ issues discussed in this report.\n      1.  Grumman (at Bethpage) is working\
    \ on a three-year DARPA\n          contract, started in January 1988 to develop\
    \ a 1.6 Gbit/s LAN,\n          for use on a plane or ship, or as a \"building\
    \ block\".  It is\n          really raw transport capacity running on two fibers\
    \ in a\n          token-ring like mode.  First milestone (after one year?) is\
    \ to\n          be a 100 Mbit/s demonstration.\n      2.  BBN Laboratories, as\
    \ part of its current three-year DARPA\n          Network-Oriented Systems contract,\
    \ has proposed design\n          concepts for a 10-100 Gbit/s wide area network.\
    \  Work under\n          this effort will include wavelength division multiplexing,\n\
    \          photonic switching, self-routing packets, and protocol design.\n  \
    \    3.  Cheriton (Stanford) research on Blazenet, a high-bandwidth\n        \
    \  network using photonic switching.\n      4.  Acampora (Bell Labs) research\
    \ on the use of wavelength\n          division multiplexing for building a shared\
    \ optical network.\n      5.  Yeh is reserching a VLSI approach to building high-bandwidth\n\
    \          parallel processing packet switch.\n      6.  Bell Labs is working\
    \ on a Metropolitan Area Network called\n          \"Manhattan Street Net.\" \
    \ This work, under Dr. Maxemchuck, is\n          similar to Blazenet.  It is in\
    \ the prototype stage for a small\n          number of street intersections; ultimately\
    \ it is meant to be\n          city-wide.  Like Blazenet, is uses photonic switching\
    \ 2 x 2\n          lithium niobate block switches.\n      7.  Ultra Network Technologies\
    \ is a Silicon Valley company which\n          has a (prototype) Gbit/s fiber\
    \ link which connects backplanes.\n          This is based on the ISO-TP4 transport\
    \ protocol.\n      8.  Jonathan Turner, Washington University, is working on a\n\
    \          Batcher-Banyan Multicast Net, based on the \"SONET\" concept,\n   \
    \       which provides 150 Mbit/s per pipe.\n      9.  David Sincowskie, Bellcore,\
    \ is working with Batcher-Banyan\n          design and has working 32x32 switches.\n\
    \      10. Stratacom has a commercial product which is really a T1 voice\n   \
    \       switch implemented internally by a packet switch, where the\n        \
    \  packet is 192 bits (T1 frame).  This switch can pass 10,000\n          packets\
    \ per second.\n      11. Stanford NAB provides 30-50 Mbit/s throughput on 100\
    \ Mbit/s\n          connection using Versatile Message Transaction Protocol (VMTP)\n\
    \          [see RFC 1045]\n      12. The December issue of IEEE Journal on Selected\
    \ Areas in\n          Communications, provides much detail concerning interconnects.\n\
    \      13. Ultranet Technology has a 480 Mbit/s connection using modified\n  \
    \        ISO TP4.\n      14. At MIT, Dave Clark has an architecture proposal of\
    \ interest.\n      15. At CMU, the work of Eric Cooper is relevant.\n      16.\
    \ At Protocol Engines, Inc., Greg Chesson is working on an XTP-\n          based\
    \ system.\n      17. Larry Landweber at Wisconsin University is doing relevant\n\
    \          work.\n      18. Honeywell is doing relevant work for NASA.\n     \
    \ 19. Kung at CMU is working on a system called \"Nectar\" based on a\n      \
    \    STARLAN on fiber connecting dissimilar processors.\n      20. Burroughs (now\
    \ Unisys) has some relevant work within the IEEE\n          802.6 committee.\n\
    \      21. Bellcore work in \"Switched Multimedia Datanet Service\" (SMDS)\n \
    \         is relevant (see paper supplied by Dave Clark).\n      22. FDDI-2, a\
    \ scheme for making TDMA channel allocations at 200\n          Mbit/s.\n     \
