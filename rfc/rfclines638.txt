This RFC corrects numerous inaccuracies in RFC #633.
Rather than trying to list all the changes, I urge all Liaisons and other interested parties to look carefully at the times now listed for the sites they are interested in.
This note presents the current IMP/TIP Preventive Maintenance schedule.
Preventive Maintenance is scheduled on a monthly basis and a given machine is normally scheduled at the same time each month; wherever possible the time is chosen to coincide with the PM time for the Host(s) at the site.
It is sometimes necessary to reschedule PM's because of network connectivity considerations or for other reasons.
Whenever this is necessary we will follow the usual procedure for scheduling down time with our "primary contact" at the site.
Permanent changes to the schedule
will he announced via the RFC mechanism.
PM's normally do not require the IMP/TIP to be taken down.
However, machines must be taken down in some cases, so no one should rely on the machine remaining available through the PM period.
PLEASE REMEMBER THAT TUESDAY MORNINGS FROM 7am TO 9am
ARE RESERVED FOR NETWORK SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE.
