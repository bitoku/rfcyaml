  - "1.  Introduction\n   The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) IMS (IP Multimedia\n\
    \   Subsystem) uses SIP [RFC3261] as its main signalling protocol.  (For\n   more\
    \ information on the IMS, a detailed description can be found in\n   3GPP TS 23.228\
    \ [3GPP.23.228] and 3GPP TS 24.229 [3GPP.24.229]).  3GPP\n   has identified a\
    \ set of requirements that can be met, according to\n   the procedures in [RFC3427],\
    \ by defining a new SIP P-header.\n   The remainder of this document is organized\
    \ as follows.  Section 3\n   describes the scenario considered by 3GPP and Section\
    \ 4 discusses the\n   requirements derived from this scenario.  Section 5 defines\
    \ the P-\n   Profile-Key header field, which meets those requirements, and Section\n\
    \   6 discusses the applicability and scope of this new header field.\n   Section\
    \ 7 registers the P-Profile-Key header field with the IANA and\n   Section 8 discusses\
    \ the security properties of the environment where\n   this header field is intended\
    \ to be used.\n"

- title: 3.  Scenario
  contents:
  - "3.  Scenario\n   In the 3GPP IMS, there are scenarios where a set of proxies\
    \ handling\n   a request need to consult the same user database, as described\
    \ in\n   [RFC4457].  Those proxies typically use the destination SIP URI of\n\
    \   the request as the key for their database queries.  Nevertheless,\n   when\
    \ a proxy handles a Wildcarded Public Service Identity, the key to\n   be used\
    \ in its database query is not the destination SIP URI of the\n   request, but\
    \ a regular expression instead.\n   Public Service Identities are SIP URIs that\
    \ refer to services instead\n   of users.  That is, they address a specific application\
    \ in an\n   Application Server.  Wildcarded Public Service Identities are a set\n\
    \   of Public Service Identities that match a regular expression and\n   share\
    \ the same profile.  For example, the Public Service Identities\n   'sip:chatroom-12@example.com'\
    \ and 'sip:chatroom-657@example.com'\n   would match the Wildcarded Public Service\
    \ Identity\n   'sip:chatroom-!.*!@example.com'.  For a description of Wildcarded\n\
    \   Public Service Identities, see 3GPP TS 23.003 [3GPP.23.003].\n   When a proxy\
    \ queries the user database for a Public Service Identity\n   for which there\
    \ is no profile in the user database, the user database\n   needs to find its\
    \ matching Wildcarded Public Service Identity.  For\n   example, if the user database\
    \ receives a query for\n   'sip:chatroom-657@example.com', the user database needs\
    \ to go through\n   all the Wildcarded Public Service Identity it has until it\
    \ finds a\n   matching one; in this case, 'sip:chatroom-!.*!@example.com'.  The\n\
    \   process to find a matching Wildcarded Public Service Identity can be\n   computationally\
    \ expensive, time consuming, or both.\n   When two proxies query the user database\
    \ for the same Public Service\n   Identity, which matches a Wildcarded Public\
    \ Service Identity, the\n   user database needs to perform the matching process\
    \ twice.  Having to\n   perform that process twice can be avoided by having the\
    \ first proxy\n   obtain the Wildcarded Public Service Identity from the user\
    \ database\n   and transfer it, piggy-backed in the SIP message, to the second\n\
    \   proxy.  This way, the second proxy can query the user database using\n   the\
    \ Wildcarded Public Service Identity directly.\n   An alternative, but undesirable,\
    \ solution would consist of having the\n   user database store every Public Service\
    \ Identity and its matching\n   Wildcarded Public Service Identity.  The scalability\
    \ and\n   manageability properties of this approach are considerably worse than\n\
    \   those of the approach described earlier.\n"
- title: 4.  Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.  Requirements\n   This section lists the requirements derived from the previous\n\
    \   scenario:\n   1.  It is necessary to optimize the response time for session\n\
    \       establishment in the 3GPP IMS.\n   2.  It is necessary to keep the user\
    \ database's size and maintenance\n       manageable (e.g., storing individual\
    \ Public Service Identities\n       matching a Wildcarded Public Service Identity\
    \ in the user\n       database is not believed to be an acceptable solution).\n"
- title: 5.  P-Profile-Key Header Field Definition
  contents:
  - "5.  P-Profile-Key Header Field Definition\n   This document defines the SIP P-Profile-Key\
    \ P-header.  The P-\n   Profile-Key P-header contains the key to be used by a\
    \ proxy to query\n   the user database for a given profile.\n   The augmented\
    \ Backus-Naur Form (BNF) [RFC4234] syntax of the\n   P-Profile-Key header field\
    \ is the following:\n      P-Profile-Key     = \"P-Profile-Key\" HCOLON (name-addr\
    \ / addr-spec)\n                           *( SEMI generic-param )\n   The format\
    \ of HCOLON, name-addr, addr-spec, and generic-param are\n   defined in [RFC3261].\
    \  The format of Wildcarded Public Service\n   Identities is defined in 3GPP TS\
    \ 23.003 [3GPP.23.003].  They take the\n   form of Extended Regular Expressions\
    \ (ERE) as defined in Chapter 9 of\n   IEEE 1003.1-2004 Part 1 [IEEE.1003.1-2004].\n\
    \   The following is an example of a P-Profile-Key header field that\n   contains\
    \ a Wildcarded Public Service Identity:\n      P-Profile-Key: <sip:chatroom-!.*!@example.com>\n"
- title: 6.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "6.  Applicability\n   According to [RFC3427], P-headers have a limited applicability.\n\
    \   Specifications of P-headers such as this RFC need to clearly document\n  \
    \ the useful scope of the proposal, and explain its limitations and why\n   it\
    \ is not suitable for the general use of SIP on the Internet.\n   The P-Profile-Key\
    \ header field is intended to be used in 3GPP IMS\n   networks.  This header field\
    \ carries the key of a service profile,\n   that is stored in a user database\
    \ referred to as HSS, between two\n   proxies, which are referred to as I-CSCF\
    \ and S-CSCF.  The I-CSCF and\n   the S-CSCF belong to the same administrative\
    \ domain and share a\n   common frame of reference to the user database.  The\
    \ I-CSCF inserts\n   the P-Profile-Key header field into a SIP request and the\
    \ S-CSCF\n   removes it before routing the request further.  (For a description\
    \ of\n   how an I-CSCF and an S-CSCF query the same user database for a single\n\
    \   request, see [RFC4457].)\n   Typically, when SIP is used on the Internet,\
    \ there are not multiple\n   proxies with a trust relationship between them querying\
    \ the same user\n   database.  Consequently, the P-Profile-Key header field does\
    \ not seem\n   useful in a general Internet environment.\n"
- title: 7.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  IANA Considerations\n   This document defines a new SIP header field: P-Profile-Key.\
    \  This\n   header field has been registered by the IANA in the SIP Parameters\n\
    \   registry under the Header Fields subregistry.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   The P-Profile-Key defined in this document is\
    \ to be used in an\n   environment where elements are trusted and where attackers\
    \ are not\n   supposed to have access to the protocol messages between those\n\
    \   elements.  Traffic protection between network elements is sometimes\n   achieved\
    \ by using IPsec and sometimes by physically protecting the\n   network.  In any\
    \ case, the environment where the P-Profile-Key header\n   field will be used\
    \ ensures the integrity and the confidentiality of\n   the contents of this header\
    \ field.  The P-Profile-Key header field\n   MUST NOT be used in environments\
    \ that do not have these\n   characteristics.\n   The P-Profile-Key header field\
    \ needs to be integrity protected to\n   keep attackers from modifying its contents.\
    \  An attacker able to\n   modify the contents of this header field could make\
    \ the network apply\n   a different service than the one corresponding to the\
    \ request\n   carrying the P-Profile-Key header field.\n   The contents of the\
    \ P-Profile-Key field need to be kept confidential.\n   An attacker able to access\
    \ the contents of this header field would\n   obtain certain knowledge about the\
    \ way services are structured in a\n   given domain.\n"
