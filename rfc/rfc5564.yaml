  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) issued in March\
    \ 2003 a set\n   of RFCs for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) ([1], [2], and\
    \ [3]),\n   which were planned to become the de facto standard for all languages.\n\
    \   In 2007 and 2008, the following working drafts were released that\n   propose\
    \ revisions to the IDNA protocol:\n   o  Internationalized Domain Names for Applications\
    \ (IDNA):\n      Background, Explanation, and Rationale [5]\n   o  Internationalized\
    \ Domain Names in Applications (IDNA): Protocol\n      [6]\n   o  An updated IDNA\
    \ criterion for right-to-left scripts [7]\n   o  The Unicode code points and IDNA\
    \ [8]\n   These documents are known collectively as \"IDNA2008\".\n   This document\
    \ constitutes a technical specification for the\n   implementation of the IDN\
    \ standards in the case of the Arabic\n   language.  It will allow the use of\
    \ standard language tables to write\n   domain names in Arabic characters.  Therefore,\
    \ it should be\n   considered as a logical extension to the IDN standards.  It\
    \ thus\n   presents guidelines for the proper use of Arabic characters with the\n\
    \   IDN standards in an Arabic language context.\n   This document reflects the\
    \ recommendations of the Arab Working Group\n   on Arabic Domain Names (AWG-ADN),\
    \ established by the League of Arab\n   States (LAS), based on standardisation\
    \ efforts of the United Nations\n   Economic and Social Commission for Western\
    \ Asia (UN-ESCWA) and on\n   that group's document, \"Guidelines for an Arabic\
    \ Internet Domain\n   Name\" [9].  This document is also in full harmony with\
    \ recent\n   rigorous discussions that took place within the major language\n\
    \   communities that use the Arabic script in their languages.\n   This document\
    \ provides guidelines for the ways Arabic characters may\n   be used for registering\
    \ Internet domain names and how linguistic-\n   specific issues should be handled.\
    \  A few rules are recommended for\n   application at the protocol level.\n  \
    \ The key words \"MUST\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHOULD\", \"RECOMMENDED\", and \"MAY\"\
    \n   in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4].\n  \
    \ Comments on this document are solicited and should be addressed to\n   the working\
    \ group's mailing list at ESCWA-ICTD@un.org and/or the\n   author(s).\n"
- title: 2.  Arabic Language-Specific Issues
  contents:
  - "2.  Arabic Language-Specific Issues\n   The main objective of the creation of\
    \ Arabic domain names is to have\n   a vehicle to increase Internet use amongst\
    \ all strata of the Arabic-\n   speaking communities.\n   Furthermore, a non-user-friendly\
    \ domain name would further add to the\n   ambiguity and the eccentricity of the\
    \ Internet to the Arabic-speaking\n   communities, thus contributing negatively\
    \ to the spread of the\n   Internet and leading to further isolation of these\
    \ communities at the\n   global level.\n   Hence, there have been intensive efforts\
    \ (especially those\n   spearheaded by Dr. Al-Zoman and contributed to by UN-ESCWA\
    \ and its\n   Arabic Domain Names Task Force (ADN-TF)) to reach consensus on a\n\
    \   multitude of linguistic issues with the following goals:\n   o  To define\
    \ the accepted Arabic character set to be used for writing\n      domain names\
    \ in Arabic, which is the subject of this document.\n   o  To define the top-level\
    \ domains of the Arabic domain name tree\n      structure (i.e., Arabic gTLDs\
    \ and ccTLDs).  This goal will be\n      handled in a separate document.\n   The\
    \ first meeting of the AWG-ADN, held in Damascus from January-\n   February 2005,\
    \ gave special attention to the following:\n   o  Simplification of the domain\
    \ names, whenever possible, to\n      facilitate the interaction of the Arabic\
    \ user with the Internet.\n   o  Adoption of solutions that do not lead to confusion\
    \ either in\n      reading or in writing, provided that this does not compromise\
    \ the\n      linguistic correctness of used words.\n   o  Mixing Arabic and non-Arabic\
    \ letters in the domain name label is\n      not acceptable.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Linguistic Issues
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Linguistic Issues\n   There are a number of linguistic issues that have\
    \ been proposed with\n   respect to the use of the Arabic language in domain names.\
    \  This\n   section will highlight some of them.  This section is based on the\n\
    \   papers of Dr. Al-Zoman ([10] and [11]) and on the report of the first\n  \
    \ meeting of AWG-ADN [12].  For details, the reader is encouraged to\n   review\
    \ these references.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  Diacritics (Tashkeel) and Shadda
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Diacritics (Tashkeel) and Shadda\n   Tashkeel and Shadda are accent marks\
    \ placed above or below Arabic\n   letters to produce proper pronunciation.  They\
    \ are thus used to\n   differentiate different meanings for different words with\
    \ the same\n   base characters.\n   Neither Tashkeel nor Shadda are permitted\
    \ in zone files when\n   registering domain names in the Arabic language, although\
    \ they are\n   permitted in the current edition of IDNA2008.  They can be supported\n\
    \   or ignored, if necessary, in the user interface with local mappings\n   and\
    \ can be stripped before IDNA processing.\n   The following are their Unicode\

- title: 2.1.2.  Kasheeda or Tatweel (Horizontal Character Size Extension)
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Kasheeda or Tatweel (Horizontal Character Size Extension)\n   Kasheeda\
    \ (U+0640 ARABIC TATWEEL) must not be used in Arabic domain\n   names and should\
    \ be disallowed for Arabic language domain names.  The\n   Kasheeda is not a letter\
    \ and does not have an effect on\n   pronunciation.  It is used to extend the\
    \ horizontal length or change\n   the shape of the preceding letter for graphical\
    \ representation\n   purposes in Arabic writing.  Accordingly, it has no value\
    \ for the\n   writing of domain names.  The same applies to all languages using\
    \ the\n   Arabic script.  The authors recommend that it should be disallowed at\n\
    \   the protocol level.\n"
- title: 2.1.3.  Character Folding
  contents:
  - "2.1.3.  Character Folding\n   Character folding is the process where multiple\
    \ letters (that may\n   have some similarity with respect to their shapes) are\
    \ folded into\n   one shape.  Examples of such Arabic characters include:\n  \
    \ o  Folding Teh Marbuta (U+0629) and Heh (U+0647) at the end of a word\n   o\
    \  Folding different forms of Hamzah (U+0622, U+0623, U+0625, U+0627)\n   o  Folding\
    \ Alef Maksura (U+0649) and Yeh (U+064A) at the end of a\n      word\n   o  Folding\
    \ Waw with Hamzah Above (U+0624) and Waw (U+0648)\n   With respect to the Arabic\
    \ language, character folding is not\n   acceptable because it changes the meaning\
    \ of words and is against the\n   principle of spelling rules.  Replacing a character\
    \ valid for use in\n   domain names with another character also valid for use\
    \ in domain\n   names, which may have a similar shape, will give a different meaning.\n\
    \   This will lead to only one word representing several words consisting\n  \
    \ of all the combinations of folded characters.  Hence, the other words\n   will\
    \ be masked by a single word [10].\n   Mis-spelling or handwriting errors do occur,\
    \ leading to mixing\n   different characters despite the fact that this is not\
    \ the case in\n   published and printed materials.  One of the motivations of\
    \ this\n   effort is to preserve the language, particularly with the spread of\n\
    \   the globalization movement.  Within this context, character folding\n   is\
    \ working against this motivation since it is going to have a\n   negative effect\
    \ on the principle and ethics of the language.\n   Technology should work to preserve\
    \ the language and not to destroy\n   it.  Thus, character folding should not\
    \ be allowed.  The case of\n   digits is treated in a separate section below.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Supported Character Set
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Supported Character Set\n   A domain name to be written in Arabic must\
    \ be composed of a sequence\n   of the following UNICODE characters and the FULL\

  contents:
  - "2.3.1.  Numerals\n   In the Arab countries, there are two sets of numerical digits\
    \ used:\n   o  Set I: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) mostly used in the western\n\
    \      part of the Arab world.\n   o  Set II: (u+0660, u+0661, u+0662, u+0663,\
    \ u+0664, u+0665, u+0666,\n      u+0667, u+0668, u+0669) mostly used in the eastern\
    \ part of the\n      Arab world.\n   Both sets may be supported in the user interface;\
    \ however, the rule\n   of numeral homogeneity must be observed.  The rule specifies\
    \ that\n   digits from the Arabic-Indic set of numerals (u+0660 to u+0669)\n \
    \  should not be allowed to mix with ASCII digits (u+0030 to u+0039)\n   within\

    \ i.e., u+02D) is\n   proposed as a separator between Arabic words to avoid confusion\
    \ that\n   can take place if the words are typed without a separator.\n   It is\

  - "3.  Summary and Conclusion\n   The proposed guidelines are in full accordance\
    \ with the IETF IDN\n   standards and take into account Arabic-language-specific\
    \ issues\n   within a compromise between grammatical rules of the Arabic language\n\
    \   and ease of use of that language on the Internet.\n   In summary, the guidelines\
    \ specify that, in Arabic domain names:\n   o  Accent marks (Tashkeel and Shadda)\
    \ are not permitted.\n   o  Character folding is not permitted.\n   o  If a numeral\
    \ from the Arabic-Indic or ASCII digit sets appears in\n      a label, numeral\
    \ homogeneity is required.\n   o  The hyphen must be used as a word separator\
    \ instead of space.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   No particular security considerations could be\
    \ identified regarding\n   the use of Arabic characters in writing domain names.\
    \  In particular,\n   any potential visual confusion between different character\
    \ strings is\n   avoided using the guidelines proposed in this document.\n"
