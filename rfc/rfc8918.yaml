  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The key to the extensibility of the Intermediate System to\n   Intermediate\
    \ System (IS-IS) protocol has been the handling of\n   unsupported and/or invalid\
    \ Type-Length-Value (TLV) tuples.  Although\n   there are explicit statements\
    \ in existing specifications, deployment\n   experience has shown that there are\
    \ inconsistencies in the behavior\n   when a TLV that is disallowed in a particular\
    \ Protocol Data Unit\n   (PDU) is received.\n   This document discusses such cases\
    \ and makes the correct behavior\n   explicit in order to ensure that interoperability\
    \ is maximized.\n   This document updates RFCs 5305 and 6232.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol\n\
    \   [ISO10589] utilizes Type-Length-Value (TLV) encoding for all content\n   in\
    \ the body of Protocol Data Units (PDUs).  New extensions to the\n   protocol\
    \ are supported by defining new TLVs.  In order to allow\n   protocol extensions\
    \ to be deployed in a backwards compatible way, an\n   implementation is required\
    \ to ignore TLVs that it does not\n   understand.  This behavior is also applied\
    \ to sub-TLVs [RFC5305],\n   which are contained within TLVs.\n   Also essential\
    \ to the correct operation of the protocol is having the\n   validation of PDUs\
    \ be independent from the validation of the TLVs\n   contained in the PDU.  PDUs\
    \ that are valid must be accepted\n   [ISO10589] even if an individual TLV contained\
    \ within that PDU is not\n   understood or is invalid in some way (e.g., incorrect\
    \ syntax, data\n   value out of range, etc.).\n   The set of TLVs (and sub-TLVs)\
    \ that are allowed in each PDU type is\n   documented in the \"TLV Codepoints\
    \ Registry\" established by [RFC3563]\n   and updated by [RFC6233] and [RFC7356].\n\
    \   This document is intended to clarify some aspects of existing\n   specifications\
    \ and, thereby, reduce the occurrence of non-conformant\n   behavior seen in real-world\
    \ deployments.  Although behaviors\n   specified in existing protocol specifications\
    \ are not changed, the\n   clarifications contained in this document serve as\
    \ updates to\n   [RFC5305] (see Section 3.3) and [RFC6232] (see Section 3.4).\n"

- title: 2.  TLV Codepoints Registry
  contents:
  - "2.  TLV Codepoints Registry\n   [RFC3563] established the IANA-managed \"IS-IS\
    \ TLV Codepoints\n   Registry\" for recording assigned TLV codepoints [TLV_CODEPOINTS].\n\
    \   The initial contents of this registry were based on [RFC3359].\n   The registry\
    \ includes a set of columns indicating in which PDU types\n   a given TLV is allowed:\n\
    \   IIH     TLV is allowed in Intermediate System to Intermediate System\n   \
    \        Hello (IIH) PDUs (Point-to-point and LAN)\n   LSP     TLV is allowed\
    \ in Link State PDUs (LSPs)\n   SNP     TLV is allowed in Sequence Number PDUs\
    \ (SNPs) (Partial\n           Sequence Number PDUs (PSNPs) and Complete Sequence\
    \ Number\n           PDUs (CSNPs))\n   Purge   TLV is allowed in LSP Purges [RFC6233]\n\
    \   If \"Y\" is entered in a column, it means the TLV is allowed in the\n   corresponding\
    \ PDU type.\n   If \"N\" is entered in a column, it means the TLV is not allowed\
    \ in the\n   corresponding PDU type.\n"
- title: 3.  TLV Acceptance in PDUs
  contents:
  - "3.  TLV Acceptance in PDUs\n   This section describes the correct behavior when\
    \ a PDU that contains\n   a TLV that is specified as disallowed in the \"TLV Codepoints\n\
    \   Registry\" is received.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Handling of Disallowed TLVs in Received PDUs Other Than LSP Purges
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Handling of Disallowed TLVs in Received PDUs Other Than LSP Purges\n  \
    \ [ISO10589] defines the behavior required when a PDU is received\n   containing\
    \ a TLV that is \"not recognised\".  It states (see Sections\n   9.5 - 9.13):\n\
    \   |  Any codes in a received PDU that are not recognised shall be\n   |  ignored.\n\
    \   This is the model to be followed when a TLV that is disallowed is\n   received.\
    \  Therefore, TLVs in a PDU (other than LSP purges) that are\n   disallowed MUST\
    \ be ignored and MUST NOT cause the PDU itself to be\n   rejected by the receiving\
    \ IS.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Special Handling of Disallowed TLVs in Received LSP Purges
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Special Handling of Disallowed TLVs in Received LSP Purges\n   When purging\
    \ LSPs, [ISO10589] recommends (but does not require) the\n   body of the LSP (i.e.,\
    \ all TLVs) be removed before generating the\n   purge.  LSP purges that have\
    \ TLVs in the body are accepted, though\n   any TLVs that are present are ignored.\n\
    \   When cryptographic authentication [RFC5304] was introduced, this\n   looseness\
    \ when processing received purges had to be addressed in\n   order to prevent\
    \ attackers from being able to initiate a purge\n   without having access to the\
    \ authentication key.  Therefore,\n   [RFC5304] imposed strict requirements on\
    \ what TLVs were allowed in a\n   purge (authentication only) and specified that:\n\
    \   |  ISes MUST NOT accept purges that contain TLVs other than the\n   |  authentication\
    \ TLV.\n   This behavior was extended by [RFC6232], which introduced the Purge\n\
    \   Originator Identification (POI) TLV, and [RFC6233], which added the\n   \"\
    Purge\" column to the \"TLV Codepoints Registry\" to identify all the\n   TLVs\
    \ that are allowed in purges.\n   The behavior specified in [RFC5304] is not backwards\
    \ compatible with\n   the behavior defined by [ISO10589]; therefore, it can only\
    \ be safely\n   enabled when all nodes support cryptographic authentication.\n\
    \   Similarly, the extensions defined by [RFC6232] are not compatible\n   with\
    \ the behavior defined in [RFC5304]; therefore, they can only be\n   safely enabled\
    \ when all nodes support the extensions.\n   When new protocol behaviors are specified\
    \ that are not backwards\n   compatible, it is RECOMMENDED that implementations\
    \ provide controls\n   for their enablement.  This serves to prevent interoperability\
    \ issues\n   and allow for non-disruptive introduction of the new functionality\n\
    \   into an existing network.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Applicability to Sub-TLVs
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Applicability to Sub-TLVs\n   [RFC5305] introduced sub-TLVs, which are\
    \ TLV tuples advertised within\n   the body of a parent TLV.  Registries associated\
    \ with sub-TLVs are\n   associated with the \"TLV Codepoints Registry\" and specify\
    \ in which\n   TLVs a given sub-TLV is allowed.  Section 2 of [RFC5305] is updated\n\
    \   by the following sentence:\n   |  As with TLVs, it is required that sub-TLVs\
    \ that are disallowed\n   |  MUST be ignored on receipt.\n   The existing sentence\
    \ in Section 2 of [RFC5305]:\n   |  Unknown sub-TLVs are to be ignored and skipped\
    \ upon receipt.\n   is replaced by:\n   |  Unknown sub-TLVs MUST be ignored and\
    \ skipped upon receipt.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Correction to POI "TLV Codepoints Registry" Entry
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Correction to POI \"TLV Codepoints Registry\" Entry\n   An error was introduced\
    \ by [RFC6232] when specifying in which PDUs\n   the POI TLV is allowed.  Section\
    \ 3 of [RFC6232] states:\n   |  The POI TLV SHOULD be found in all purges and\
    \ MUST NOT be found in\n   |  LSPs with a non-zero Remaining Lifetime.\n   However,\
    \ the IANA section of the same document states:\n   |  The additional values for\
    \ this TLV should be IIH:n, LSP:y, SNP:n,\n   |  and Purge:y.\n   The correct\
    \ setting for \"LSP\" is \"n\".  This document updates\n   [RFC6232] by correcting\
    \ that error.\n   This document also updates the previously quoted text from Section\
    \ 3\n   of [RFC6232] to be:\n   |  The POI TLV SHOULD be sent in all purges and\
    \ MUST NOT be sent in\n   |  LSPs with a non-zero Remaining Lifetime.\n"
- title: 4.  TLV Validation and LSP Acceptance
  contents:
  - "4.  TLV Validation and LSP Acceptance\n   The correct format of a TLV and its\
    \ associated sub-TLVs, if\n   applicable, is defined in the document(s) that introduces\
    \ each\n   codepoint.  The definition MUST include what action to take when the\n\
    \   format/content of the TLV does not conform to the specification\n   (e.g.,\
    \ \"MUST be ignored on receipt\").  When making use of the\n   information encoded\
    \ in a given TLV (or sub-TLV), receiving nodes MUST\n   verify that the TLV conforms\
    \ to the standard definition.  This\n   includes cases where the length of a TLV/sub-TLV\
    \ is incorrect and/or\n   cases where the value field does not conform to the\
    \ defined\n   restrictions.\n   However, the unit of flooding for the IS-IS Update\
    \ process is an LSP.\n   The presence of a TLV (or sub-TLV) with content that\
    \ does not conform\n   to the relevant specification MUST NOT cause the LSP itself\
    \ to be\n   rejected.  Failure to follow this requirement will result in\n   inconsistent\
    \ LSP Databases on different nodes in the network that\n   will compromise the\
    \ correct operation of the protocol.\n   LSP Acceptance rules are specified in\
    \ [ISO10589].  Acceptance rules\n   for LSP purges are extended by [RFC5304] and\
    \ [RFC5310] and are\n   further extended by [RFC6233].\n   [ISO10589] also specifies\
    \ the behavior when an LSP is not accepted.\n   This behavior is _not_ altered\
    \ by extensions to the LSP Acceptance\n   rules, i.e., regardless of the reason\
    \ for the rejection of an LSP,\n   the Update process on the receiving router\
    \ takes the same action.\n"
