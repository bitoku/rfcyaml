  - "                Proposed Change in IMP-to-Host Protocol\n        We are currently\
    \ considering a redefinition of the IMP-to-Host\n   error message types (type\
    \ 1 and type 8) and the creation of addi-\n   tional IMP-to-Host error message\
    \ types.  We believe that these\n   changes will assist the Hosts in determining\
    \ appropriate recovery\n   action, without causing any serious reprogramming problems.\
    \  Our\n   current plans are to install these changes within a few months;\n \
    \  therefore we should be informed of any strong negative reactions\n   relatively\
    \ quickly.\n        The proposed changes fall into two general classes as de-\n\
    \   scribed below:\n        A)  General Error Message\n            Under certain\
    \ circumstances, particularly when the Host\n            has been unresponsive\
    \ to queued input for a \"long time\"\n            the IMP drops its ready line\
    \ for a short period, causing\n            the \"error flip-flops\" to be set\
    \ (see RFC #270, NIC 7818).\n            Under these conditions the IMP sends\
    \ a few NOP's to the\n            Host and then resumes normal operation.  We\
    \ propose to\n            send the Host a new message (message type 13) in addition\n\
    \            to the NOPs; this message will tell the Host that the\n         \
    \   IMP's Ready Line was dropped, that the IMP's error flop\n            was set,\
    \ and that the IMP will respond to the next com-\n            pletion of a Host-to-IMP\
    \ message with a type 1 or type 8\n            message (because of the setting\
    \ of the IMP's error flop.\n        B)  Error Messages which are Responses to\
    \ Specific\n            Host-to-IMP Transmissions:\n            1)  IMP-to-Host\
    \ message type 1 will be redefined to mean:\n                \"IMP's Error flip-flop\
    \ was set on a message which\n                the IMP cannot identify.\"\n   \
    \         2)  IMP-to-Host message type 8 will be redefined to mean:\n        \
    \        \"IMP's Error flip-flop was set during receipt of the\n             \
    \   message identified by the 'source' and 'link number'\n                bits\
    \ of this error message.\"\n                identified).\"\n            4)  IMP-to-Host\
    \ message type 11 will be defined to mean:\n                \"A Host-to-IMP message\
    \ was too long; the message is\n                identified by the 'source' and\
    \ 'link number' bits\n                of this error message.\"\n            5)\
    \  IMP-to-Host message type 12 will be defined to mean:\n                \"A Host-to-IMP\
    \ message with an illegal message type\n                code was received; the\
    \ message is identified by the\n                'source' and 'link number' bits\
    \ of this error message.\n                (Note that the erroneous type code is\
    \ not included in\n                the error message.)\"\n   AAM/jm\n       [\
