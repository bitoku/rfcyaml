  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Several Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [EAP] authentication\n
    \  methods employ X.509 public key certificates.  For example, EAP-TLS\n   [EAP-TLS]
    can be used with PPP [PPP] as well as IEEE 802.1X [802.1X].\n   PPP is used for
    dial-up and VPN environments.  IEEE 802.1X defines\n   port-based, network access
    control, and it is used to provide\n   authenticated network access for Ethernet,
    Token Ring, Wireless LANs\n   (WLANs) [802.11], and other IEEE 802 networks.\n
    \  Automated selection of client certificates for use with PPP and IEEE\n   802.1X
    is highly desirable.  By using certificate extensions to\n   identify the intended
    environment for a particular certificate, the\n   need for user input is minimized.
    \ Further, the certificate\n   extensions facilitate the separation of administrative
    functions\n   associated with certificates used for different environments.\n
    \  IEEE 802.1X can be used for authentication with multiple networks.\n   For
    example, the same wireless station might use IEEE 802.1X to\n   authenticate to
    a corporate IEEE 802.11 WLAN and a public IEEE 802.11\n   \"hotspot.\"  Each of
    these IEEE 802.11 WLANs has a different network\n   name, called Service Set Identifier
    (SSID).  If the network operators\n   have a roaming agreement, then cross-realm
    authentication allows the\n   same certificate to be used on both networks.  However,
    if the\n   networks do not have a roaming agreement, then the IEEE 802.1X\n   supplicant
    needs to select a certificate for the current network\n   environment.  Including
    a list of SSIDs in a certificate extension\n   facilitates automated selection
    of an appropriate X.509 public key\n   certificate without human user input.  Alternatively,
    a companion\n   attribute certificate could contain the list of SSIDs.\n   This
    document defines extended key usage values and a WLAN-specific\n   certificate
    extension for use in certificates issued to clients of\n   PPP and WLANs.\n"

      \ Six significant changes\n   are included:\n      * This document now uses
      the same normative reference for ASN.1\n        as RFC 3280 [PROFILE].  The
      intent is to have the same\n        dependencies.\n      * The discussion of
      the critical bit in the certificate extension\n        in section 2 is aligned
      with RFC 3280.  Also, the discussion of\n        the key usage certificate extension
      was expanded.\n      * RFC 3770 contained a typographical error in the object\n
      \       identifier for the Wireless LAN SSID Attribute Certificate\n        Attribute.
      \ Section 4 corrects the typographical error.\n      * Clarified that the SSID
      extension may appear in certificates\n        that do not include the extended
      key usage extension.\n      * Uses the terms \"peer\", \"EAP Server\", and \"supplicant\"
      as they\n        are defined in [EAP] and [802.1X].  RFC 3770 used \"client\"\n
      \       and \"server\".\n      * The object identifier for the extended key
      usage certificate\n        extension is listed in RFC 3280, and it is no longer\n
      \       repeated in this document.\n"

  - "2. EAP Extended Key Usage Values\n   RFC 3280 [PROFILE] specifies the extended
    key usage X.509 certificate\n   extension.  The extension indicates one or more
    purposes for which\n   the certified public key may be used.  The extended key
    usage\n   extension can be used in conjunction with key usage extension, which\n
    \  indicates the intended purpose of the certified public key.\n   The extended
    key usage extension syntax is repeated here for\n   convenience:\n      ExtKeyUsageSyntax
    \ ::=  SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF KeyPurposeId\n      KeyPurposeId  ::=  OBJECT
    IDENTIFIER\n   This specification defines two KeyPurposeId values: one for EAP
    over\n   PPP, and one for EAP over LAN (EAPOL).  Inclusion of the EAP over PPP\n
    \  value indicates that the certified public key is appropriate for use\n   by
    a peer with EAP in the PPP environment.  The inclusion of the\n   EAPOL value
    indicates that the certified public key is appropriate\n   for use by a peer with
    the EAP in the LAN environment.  Inclusion of\n   both values indicates that the
    certified public key is appropriate\n   for use by a peer in either of the environments.\n

    \ OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { id-kp 13 }\n      id-kp-eapOverLAN  OBJECT IDENTIFIER
    \ ::=  { id-kp 14 }\n   The extended key usage extension MAY, at the option of
    the\n   certificate issuer, be either critical or non-critical.\n   Certificate-using
    applications MAY require the extended key usage\n   extension to be present in
    a certificate, and they MAY require a\n   particular KeyPurposeId value to be
    present (such as id-kp-eapOverPPP\n   or id-kp-eapOverLAN) within the extended
    key usage extension.  If\n   multiple KeyPurposeId values are included, the certificate-using\n
    \  application need not recognize all of them, as long as the required\n   KeyPurposeId
    value is present.\n   If a certificate contains a key usage extension, the KeyUsage
    bits\n   that are needed depends on the EAP method that is employed.\n   If a
    certificate contains both a key usage extension and an extended\n   key usage
    extension, then both extensions MUST be processed\n   independently, and the certificate
    MUST only be used for a purpose\n   consistent with both extensions.  If there
    is no purpose consistent\n   with both extensions, then the certificate-using
    application MUST NOT\n   use the certificate for any purpose.\n"

  - "3. WLAN SSID Public Key Certificate Extension\n   The Wireless LAN (WLAN) System
    Service identifiers (SSIDs) public key\n   certificate extension is always non-critical.
    \ It contains a list of\n   SSIDs.  The list of SSIDs MAY be used to select the
    correct\n   certificate for authentication in a particular WLAN.\n   If the extended
    key usage extension appears in the same certificate\n   as the SSID extension,
    then the extended key usage extension MUST\n   indicate that the certified public
    key is appropriate for use with\n   the EAP in the LAN environment by including
    the id-kp-eapOverLAN\n   KeyPurposeId value.\n   Since SSID values are unmanaged,
    the same SSID can appear in\n   different certificates that are intended to be
    used with different\n   WLANs.  When this occurs, automatic selection of the certificate
    will\n   fail, and the implementation SHOULD obtain help from the user to\n   choose
    the correct certificate.  In cases where a human user is\n   unavailable, each
    potential certificate MAY be tried until one\n   succeeds.  However, by maintaining
    a cache of Access Point (AP) MAC\n   addresses or an EAP server identity with
    which the certificate has\n   successfully authenticated, user involvement can
    be minimized.\n   RADIUS [RADIUS1, RADIUS2] is usually used as the authentication\n
    \  service in WLAN deployments.  The cache can be used to avoid future\n   human
    user interaction or certificate selection by trial and error.\n   The WLAN SSID

  - "5. Security Considerations\n   The procedures and practices employed by the certification
    authority\n   (CA) MUST ensure that the correct values for the extended key usage\n
    \  extension and SSID extension are inserted in each certificate that is\n   issued.
    \ Relying parties may accept or reject a particular\n   certificate for an intended
    use based on the information provided in\n   these extensions.  Incorrect representation
    of the information in\n   either extension could cause the relying party to reject
    an otherwise\n   appropriate certificate or accept a certificate that ought to
    be\n   rejected.\n   If multiple SSIDs are included in a certificate, then information
    can\n   be obtained from a certificate about the SSIDs associated with\n   several
    WLANs, not with the WLAN that is currently being accessed.\n   The intended use
    of the SSID extensions is to help a peer determine\n   the correct certificate
    to present when trying to gain access to a\n   WLAN.  In most situations, including
    EAP-TLS, the peer will have the\n   opportunity to validate the certificate provided
    by the EAP server\n   before transmitting one of its own certificates to the EAP
    server.\n   While the peer may not be sure that the EAP server has access to the\n
    \  corresponding private key until later in the protocol exchange, the\n   identity
    information in the EAP server certificate can be used to\n   determine whether
    or not the peer certificate ought to be provided.\n   When the same peer certificate
    is used to authenticate to multiple\n   WLANs, the list of SSIDs is available
    from servers associated with\n   each WLAN.  Of course, the list of SSIDs is also
    made available to\n   any eavesdroppers on the WLAN.  Whenever this SSID disclosure
    is a\n   concern, different peer certificates ought to be used for the each\n
    \  WLAN.\n   SSID values are unmanaged; therefore, SSIDs may not be unique.\n
    \  Hence, it is possible for peer certificates that are intended to be\n   used
    with different WLANs to contain the same SSID.  In this case,\n   automatic selection
    of the certificate will fail, and the\n   implementation SHOULD obtain help from
    the user to choose the correct\n   certificate.  If a human user is unavailable,
    each potential\n   certificate MAY be tried until one succeeds, disclosing the
    list of\n   SSIDs associated with each certificate, which might otherwise not
    be\n   disclosed.  Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that sequentially trying\n   each
    certificate only be employed when user selection is unavailable\n   or impractical.\n
    \  In practice, disclosure of the SSID is of little concern.  Some WLAN\n   security
    experts recommend that the SSID be masked in the beacon sent\n   out by Access
    Points (APs).  The intent is to make it harder for an\n   attacker to find the
    correct AP to target.  However, other WLAN\n   management messages include the
    SSID, so this practice only forces\n   the attacker to eavesdrop on the WLAN management
    messages instead of\n   the beacon.  Therefore, placing the SSID in the certificate
    does not\n   make matters worse.\n"
