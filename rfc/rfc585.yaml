  - "              Arpanet Users Interest Working Group Meeting\n   A new group, the\
    \ Arpanet Users Interest Working Group (USING) is the\n   outgrowth of a meeting\
    \ held in Boston on May 22-23, 1973.  The\n   meeting, cochaired by Dave Crocker,\
    \ UCLA-NMC, and Nancy Neigus, BBN,\n   followed BBN's Resource Sharing Workshop.\n"
- title: PURPOSE
  contents:
  - "PURPOSE\n   The USING meeting was seen by the members as a forum for Network\n\
    \   Users to air complaints, exchange information, voice desires, and\n   present\
    \ concrete proposals for the design and implementation of\n   user-oriented Network\
    \ capabilities.\n   The group will devote itself to lobbying on behalf of user\
    \ interests,\n   to promoting and facilitating resource sharing, to improving\
    \ user\n   interfaces (support), and to studies of standardization.  The\n   ultimate\
    \ goal will be provide users identification of, and\n   facilitated access to,\
    \ whatever resources on the Network they might\n   wish to use.\n   Neigus, Crocker,\
    \ and Iseli of MITRE were selected to define the\n   objectives and goals of USING\
    \ in more detail, and they will present\n   their discussion in a later publication.\n"

- title: CATEGORIES OF CONCERN
  contents:
  - "CATEGORIES OF CONCERN\n   The meeting began by attempting to create a relatively\
    \ complete list\n   of topics directly relevant to users.  The intention was to\
    \ then\n   discuss some of these categories in detail.  The categories of\n  \
    \ concern to users are listed here along with a brief outline of the\n   discussion\
    \ and recommendations associated with each category.  Not\n   all topics were\
    \ discussed fully due to time limitations.  It was\n   acknowledged that some\
    \ of the recommendations were quite extensive,\n   but that they should be mentioned\
    \ even though their implementation\n   would be far off.\n   1. Online and Offline\
    \ Documentation, Information Sharing, and\n      Consulting\n      a. There is\
    \ a general need to upgrade the quality, technical\n         accuracy, timeliness,\
    \ dissemination, and format of both online\n         and offline documentation.\n\
    \      b. Documentation should avoid \"buzz\" words (jargon), and should\n   \
    \      follow easily understood syntax conventions, abbreviation\n         standards,\
    \ reference citation rules, etc.  However, there\n         probably cannot be\
    \ a standard format for writing documentation.\n      c. Offline documentation\
    \ should be well indexed, should contain a\n         good table-of-contents, and\
    \ should be written in an easily\n         browsable format.  Online documentation\
    \ should be presented in\n         a browse mode with well-labeled categories\
    \ of information as\n         well as a keyword search capability.\n      d. Documentation\
    \ should be identified with date/author/version\n         information, particularly\
    \ in large online documents, so that it\n         is easier to keep the most current\
    \ version of a document and to\n         query the author, in the event of problems\
    \ with the\n         documentation.\n      e. Network news needs to be gathered\
    \ and intelligently distributed\n         to users (Network PR).\n      f. Users\
    \ need several levels and styles of access to\n         documentation, whether\
    \ online or offline, based upon their\n         experience, interests, and preferences.\n\
    \      g. Each server site should also provide some degree of information\n  \
    \       variety in online \"help\" mechanisms, tailored to fit the needs\n   \
    \      and experience of different user types.\n         In addition, entering\
    \ \"Help\" from the EXEC level of a system\n         should direct a user to ALL\
    \ procedural-type information.\n      h. New users should be carefully introduced\
    \ to the Network by way\n         of a New Users Packet (NUP).  Since the MITRE-TIP\
    \ group is the\n         official contact for new users, they should design such\
    \ a\n         packet and incorporate suggestions from USING.\n         This packet\
    \ should eventually contain, among other things:\n            a definition of,\
    \ and introduction to the Network\n            a list of sites\n            step-by-step\
    \ scenarios for accessing functional documents an\n            related online\
    \ items\n            a definition of who can get on the Network\n            some\
    \ quick-reference charts showing a list of Network\n            services available\
    \ to new users\n            and an introduction to Network groups, including USING,\
    \ as\n            well as the names of Network consultants, assistants, and\n\
    \            the like.\n      i. Information-accessing mechanisms should be provided\
    \ for users,\n         including interactive tutorials, user scenarios, and other\n\
    \         training mechanisms.\n      j. A Network-wide \"who, what, where and\
    \ when\" information system\n         should be implemented. (This was nicknamed\
    \ the Network Yellow\n         Pages.)  Discussion of support for such a system\
    \ focused on\n         obtaining some form of central funding.\n      k. The concept\
    \ of `Regional Agents' for collecting information for\n         the Resource Notebook\
    \ was discussed.\n         Several felt that what was really needed was a `rebirth'\
    \ of the\n         original concept of Technical Liaison as the person who\n \
    \        provides information to the NIC and technical assistance to\n       \
    \  users.\n         There was concern voiced about the number of people collecting\n\
    \         information and the redundancy of the requests received by\n       \
    \  sites.\n         There was also concern about what incentives there are (or\n\
    \         should be or can be) for Liaisons to perform their tasks\n         adequately\
    \ by providing truly up-to-date and complete\n         information (carrot vs.\
    \ stick).\n      l. Server Sites should provide a variety of consulting services\
    \ to\n         supplement `help' and general information services.\n         Consultants\
    \ could represent the whole Network, a group of\n         sites, a single site,\
    \ general areas such as software, or\n         specific applications processes.\
    \  This could fit into the\n         workings of the Network Servers Group.\n\
    \   2. Standardization for the User\n      a. If they so desire, users should\
    \ only have to learn one\n         Executive (command) language, rather than 20.\
    \  Rather than have\n         every site change its interface to the user, it\
    \ was suggested\n         that there be a Network Common Command Language Protocol\
    \ which\n         is translated to/from the host's own Executive command\n   \
    \      language.\n         As with FTP and RJE, a human user should be able to\
    \ type in CCL\n         Protocol directly, though many sites may want to allow\
    \ a local\n         user to type in their local Executive language, and then they\n\
    \         will translate it into CCLP, for the foreign host.\n         Any Network\
    \ Common Command Language should be compatible with\n         batch systems as\
    \ well as with interactive systems, and should\n         provide an effective\
    \ means for batch job submission and\n         control.\n         Bowles, Hathaway,\
    \ and Stoughton volunteered to outline specs\n         for Network command language\
    \ that would be compatible with\n         ideas suggested by Padlipsky and discussed\
    \ at the meeting.\n      b. One of the functions to included in a Common Command\
    \ Language\n         is a simple editor, which Padlipsky has outlined.  The editor\n\
    \         should be easy for users to learn as well as for servers to\n      \
    \   implement or interface to their own editors.\n   3. Status/Measurement of\
    \ Site Performance\n      a. A variety of performance measures, for the individual\
    \ sites,\n         needs to be derived, acquired, maintained, and made available\n\
    \         to users.\n         This could include some attempt to measure average\
    \ \"response\n         time\", relative costs (relative to type of task, that\
    \ is),\n         availability/reliability, etc.\n      b. Mechanisms are needed\
    \ for software certification and for\n         measuring and verifying the accuracy\
    \ and/or reliability of\n         systems, hardware, protocols, applications software,\
    \ etc.\n   4. User Feedback Mechanisms\n      a. There is a need for a uniform\
    \ Network gripe/suggestion\n         mechanism.  This should cover several types\
    \ of gripes,\n         including program bugs and service complaints.\n      b.\
    \ Each user registering a complaint deserves immediate\n         acknowledgement\
    \ and some indication of what, if any, action\n         will be taken.\n     \
    \ c. The NIC should set up Network ident groups for Principal\n         Investigators,\
    \ Liaisons, Station Agents, Accounts\n         Administrators, Consultants, etc.,\
    \ so that users can easily\n         direct their comments, inquiries and mail\
    \ to these groups.\n      d. A Network Servers Group should be started, to coordinate\
    \ the\n         activities (to the extent possible) of the servers (a Server's\n\
    \         Cartel?).  It would also provide a focus for user complaints\n     \
    \    and suggestions.\n         (The group was originally dubbed the \"Tobacco\
    \ Institute\".  The\n         Tobacco Institute acts as a representative for the\
    \ disparate\n         Tobacco companies, and attempts to convince the public that\n\
    \         smoking is good for them.)\n         The point of the Servers Group\
    \ -- rather than trying to\n         convince the Network public that servers\
    \ are good for them --\n         would be for servers to help each other with\
    \ common tasks (such\n         as documentation) that are too big for each to\
    \ handle alone.\n            This eventually works in the users interest, because\
    \ the\n            servers (in the Network free-market economy) are dependent\n\
    \            upon the users for their livelihood.\n         There should be cooperation\
    \ between the Server Group and USING,\n         but the groups would NOT be comprised\
    \ of the same people.  They\n         are on opposite sides of the product.\n\
    \      e. Station Agents should supply users with information of a\n         clerical\
    \ nature such as names, phone numbers, titles,\n         documentations, etc.\
    \  To be able to do this, the Agents must\n         first HAVE this information.\n\
    \   5. Messages to Users\n      a. Messages to users, such as error messages or\
    \ diagnostics,\n         should be simple, clear, and meaningful to users.\n \
    \     b. The user should have the ability to control notifications given\n   \
    \      to him, by being able to queue messages or refuse them.\n      c. Users\
    \ should be able to suppress diagnostics or to specify\n         abbreviated or\
    \ expanded versions.\n   6. Tailoring of Resources for Users\n      a. Interfaces\
    \ to users should support different levels of user\n         proficiency, without\
    \ being a burden to the more proficient\n         user.\n         That is, a new\
    \ user needs more prompting, etc.  A more\n         experienced user does not\
    \ need and DOES NOT WANT such\n         prompting.  So the capabilities of the\
    \ interface, which are not\n         needed by a specific user, should be transparent.\n\
    \      b. A method for work flow management that permits a user to set up\n  \
    \       a sequence of computer tasks that are contingent upon one\n         another\
    \ is needed.  The user should be able to describe this\n         sequence interactively\
    \ and then be able to detach and continue\n         with other work while the\
    \ sequence of tasks is being carried\n         out.\n   7. Personal Information\
    \ Management System\n      a. Users need a system for managing all types of machine-based\n\
    \         contacts such as mail, links, journal items, etc.\n         Such a system\
    \ should `log' what has been received and allow the\n         user to keep a copy,\
    \ if desired.\n         It should also provide the user with options for organizing\
    \ his\n         personal information.\n      b. A personal `calendar' or reminder\
    \ system would be handy,\n         especially if it allowed one to look ahead\
    \ to coming events as\n         well as to check events for the current day or\
    \ week.\n      c. A `return to sender' feature is needed in the Network-wide mail\n\
    \         address system.\n      d. (Discussion of the current work on the Mail\
    \ Protocol indicated\n         that some of these ideas are already being considered)\n\
    \   8. Uniform Accounting Procedures and Online Status of Accounts\n      a. This\
    \ topic was covered in detail by sections of the Resource\n         Sharing Workshop.\
    \  It is mentioned here only because it is a\n         problem of real concern\
    \ to users.\n   9. Trial Usage and Browsing\n      a. Ideally, users should be\
    \ allowed some `free' sampling of\n         systems and features available at\
    \ each site.  Practically, this\n         presents problems of space allocation,\
    \ accounting, consulting,\n         etc.  Although none of these problems are\
    \ easy to solve\n         equitably, an attempt should still be made to provide\
    \ some free\n         usage to everyone.\n      b. Several types of trial usage\
    \ should be considered, such as for\n         those who will make an immediate\
    \ commitment and those who wish\n         merely to sample, without making any\
    \ commitment.\n   10.  Prelogon Facilities\n      a. Some facilities should be\
    \ available as prelogon facilities, so\n         that any user can access them\
    \ whether or not he has an account,\n         directory, etc., at a given site.\
    \  Some sites will not be able\n         to support many of these functions, so\
    \ a required set must be\n         kept to a minimum.\n   11.  Remote User Facilitation\n\
    \      a. Users not only need help with actual use of systems from a\n       \
    \  remote site, but they also need facilitation of administrative\n         tasks.\
    \  Station Agents should be able to handle most of these\n         problems or\
    \ transfer the user to the proper person.  System\n         access requirements,\
    \ account and billing problems, and document\n         acquisition need particular\
    \ attention.\n      b. There should be a simple mechanism for users to acquire/update\n\
    \         information in functional documents such as the Resource Note-\n   \
    \      book and in files such as identification files.  Publications\n       \
    \  or files of this sort should combine the collective input of\n         all\
    \ the users.\n   12.  Transportability of Resources and Information\n      a.\
    \ Users should be able to easily transfer information, such as\n         files,\
    \ memos, mail, online documentation, (programs?!?) etc.,\n         from one site\
    \ to another.\n   13.  Network Utilities\n      a. Should distributed data banks\
    \ and similar features be\n         considered Network utilities that can be used\
    \ by all?\n         The idea of \"Network Utilities\" was recognized as an\n \
    \        interesting one by the group, but there was little agreement as\n   \
    \      to what constitutes Network utilities or how they should be\n         supported.\n"
