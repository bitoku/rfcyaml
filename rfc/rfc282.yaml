  - "                        GRAPHICS MEETING REPORT\n   The second Network Graphics\
    \ Group Meeting was convened at the\n   Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab at\
    \ 6:00p.m. Sunday, November\n   21st.  (Attendees are listed in the Appendix.)\
    \  Jim Michener served\n   as chairman, and I either volunteered or was volunteered\
    \ to serve as\n   recording secretary, with Karl Kelly's assistance in keeping\
    \ notes.\n   An agenda was agreed upon for the meeting, covering three major\n\
    \   topics: 1) reports on the experiments which had been set up at the\n   July\
    \ meeting,  2) prepared talks by attendees who had general points\n   to raise\
    \ about Network Graphics, and  3) specification of a \"first-\n   pass\" graphics\
    \ protocol.  Before the reports were given, some general\n   discussion was held\
    \ on two important topics: the \"context\" problem\n   (just how, in the Network\
    \ sense, are graphics connections\n   established, and who is supposed to do what\
    \ for whom), and what might\n   be called the \"console types\" problem (should\
    \ there be a separate\n   protocol for inherently static storage tube type devices\
    \ and one for\n   inherently interactive refresh type devices which have their\
    \ own\n   processors, or can we come up with some sort of continuous -- or\n \
    \  layered -- single protocol which covers both).  Both points were\n   noted\
    \ as being necessary to keep in mind for the protocol\n   specification phase\
    \ of the meeting, an apparent consensus emerged\n   that a single protocol would\
    \ be preferable, and the reports on\n   experiments were turned to.\n"

  - "REPORTS ON EXPERIMENTS\n   RAND - UCSB\n   Eric Harslem of RAND and Ron Stoughton\
    \ of UCSB reported on their\n   experiment, which entailed use of the UCSB On-Line\
    \ System (OLS) from\n   RAND Videographics terminals.  As demonstrated by a videotape\
    \ which\n   was shown, the experiment was successful.  An RFC describing the\n\
    \   simple protocol they used is forthcoming.  As noted in their\n   discussion\
    \ and in the RFC, the experimental protocol is not being\n   proposed as a Network\
    \ standard.  In addition to using OLS from RAND,\n   a subsidiary experiment tested\
    \ the sensitivity of the hook-up to\n   variations in the size of the allocations\
    \ (in the Host-to-Host\n   Protocol sense) given at the RAND end.  It seemed clear\
    \ from the\n   videotape of the same pictures being drawn at various allocation\n\
    \   levels that larger allocations allow for noticeably smoother\n   \"drawing\"\
    \ at maximum allocation, the picture essentially appeared all\n   at once, whereas\
    \ at minimum allocation, NCP-NCP overhead was\n   sufficiently large that the\
    \ picture appeared a portion at a time.\n   SDC - DMCG\n   An experiment intended\
    \ to input tablet data collected at MIT Project\n   MAC's Dynamic Modeling/Computer\
    \ Graphics Group's PDP-10 to a\n   character recognizer package at SDC was reported\
    \ on by Jean Saylor of\n   SDC and Jim Michener of DMCG.  Problems ranging from\n\
    \   hardware/software difficulties at both ends (and in the middle) to\n   time\
    \ zone-induced system availability conflicts retarded the\n   experiment's progress,\
    \ although some transmission of data has been\n   achieved.\n   ILLINOIS MULTICS\n\
    \   Also plagued with problems was the attempt to drive a console at U.\n   of\
    \ Ill. from the Multics Graphics System.  This experiment was\n   reported on\
    \ by Jack Bouknight (Illinois) and Ed Meyer (Multics).  An\n   NCP bug at the\
    \ Multics end and a machine switch at the Illinois end\n   combined to prevent\
    \ the carrying out of the experiment.\n   DIGRESSION\n   During his report, Bouknight\
    \ expressed concern as to whether the\n   Network as a whole is as yet sufficiently\
    \ reliable to support\n   graphics work.  As the ensuing discussion focused on\
    \ the frequent\n   unavailability of a host other than Multics, I feel that it\
    \ is within\n   my province to draw the curtain of anonymity over it without\n\
    \   prejudice.  However, I feel that mention of the discussion need not\n   be\
    \ suppressed as well, in view of the fact that most of the attendees\n   shared\
    \ Jack's concern.  The apparent consensus, reached after\n   considerable conversation,\
    \ is that the present reliability level of\n   the Network server hosts is not\
    \ crippling to graphics work, but can\n   be quite hampering.\n   SEX - NIC\n\
    \   Jon Postel (UCLA) and John Melvin (SRI) gave the last experiment\n   report,\
    \ on an attempt to make an IMLAC on the SEX system look like a\n   local NLS console\
    \ at the Network Information Center.  The experiment\n   has not yet been performed,\
    \ but UCLA has ordered the necessary\n   equipment to modify their IMLAC.\n"
- title: PRESENTATIONS
  contents:
  - "PRESENTATIONS\n   Most of the speakers who gave prepared talks responded favorably\
    \ to\n   my plea for abstracts, probably out of kindness, but perhaps out of\n\
    \   fear of (threatened) garbling.  Authors' abstracts are in quotation\n   marks\
    \ in the following section.\n   PLASMA PANEL DISPLAY - Dave Liddle\n   \"The Owens\
    \ - Illinois DS-1 terminal will be available to Network\n   users who request\
    \ them through ARPA.  The display module is the OI\n   512X512 line plasma panel;\
    \ the processor is a 16 bit, 4K machine with\n   modem; ASCII keyboard, and optional\
    \ tape cassette.  Simple software\n   (character and vector generators, etc.)\
    \ will be provided.  If orders\n   can be assembled by 1 January, deliveries will\
    \ begin this summer.\"\n    LANGUAGES FOR GRAPHICS ATTENTION HANDLING - Ira Cotton\n\
    \   \"Available languages for programming the processing of operator\n   inputs\
    \ to a computer graphic system were organized into functional\n   classes and\
    \ briefly surveyed.  Some of the problems associated with\n   providing this facility\
    \ in a multi-computer graphics system (such as\n   the Network) were discussed,\
    \ and a new approach was presented.  This\n   system, implemented by Univac for\
    \ one of its systems, employs an\n   interpretively executed command language\
    \ to direct attention-handling\n   in the remote graphics controller.  The commands\
    \ of the language were\n   outlined, and some program fragments illustrated.\"\
    \n   \"INTERACTIVE\" GRAPHICS ISSUES - Ken Pogran\n   \"The purpose of this talk\
    \ was to raise a number of significant issues\n   we must face in the development\
    \ of a Network protocol for\n   _interactive_ graphics.  While the bulk of the\
    \ work at this second\n   graphics meeting dealt with a protocol for \"static\"\
    \ or \"storage-tube\"\n   graphics, it is appropriate that we begin to think about\
    \ the problems\n   we will encounter in the development of an interactive graphics\n\
    \   protocol.\"\n   \"The issues raised included: 1) the nature of graphical interaction,\n\
    \   2) various possible hardware/software configurations which might be\n   employed,\
    \ 3) computational capabilities required at the serve and\n   user host sites,\
    \ 4) the nature of a graphical data structure suited\n   to a wide range of applications,\
    \ and 5) the nature and treatment of\n   graphic inputs for a generalized interactive\
    \ graphics system.\"\n   PROTOCOL FOR THE OLS EXPERIMENT - Ron Stoughton, Eric\
    \ Harslem\n   \"A short presentation was given describing a graphics protocol\
    \ used\n   to interface the RAND Videographics System to the USCB On-Line\n  \
    \ System.  A video tape of alive demonstration of the experiment [had\n   also\
    \ been] presented.  An RFC describing the experiment and protocol\n   in detail\
    \ will be issued in the near future.\"\n   CONNECTION CONSIDERATIONS - Andy Moorer\
    \ [Abstracted by M.A.P.]\n   The topic was started succinctly as \"how this thing\
    \ should work.\"  It\n   was proposed to use the Telnet Protocol for simple graphics\
    \ (i.e.,\n   when device dependent codes are being transmitted), with the addition\n\
    \   of Telnet control codes for Enter graphics Mode, Leave Graphics Mode,\n  \
    \ and Console Type being necessary.  For complex graphics (i.e., when\n   an intermediate\
    \ form is being transmitted) it was proposed that an\n   additional socket pair\
    \ be employed.\n   CONNECTION TYPES - Jim Michener [Abstracted by M.A.P]\n   There\
    \ are at least three types of graphics devices which may be\n   connected over\
    \ the Network: \"simple\" (ARDS-like), \"smart\" (IMLAC-\n   like), and \"powerful\"\
    \ (E&S-like).  There are three kinds of\n   processing involved: applications\
    \ packages (A), graphics packages\n   (G), and conversion to device-specific codes\
    \ (C), potentially from an\n   intermediate form such as the \"Network Standard\
    \ Graphics Stream\"\n   discussed in earlier RFC's.  There are also three places\
    \ where each\n   kind of processing may be performed: at the graphics device itself,\n\
    \   at the local host (which may not be able to help if it's a TIP), and\n   at\
    \ a remote host (OR HOST).  This should lead neatly to some sort of\n   3X3X3\
    \ matrix which depicts the sorts of connections we want to\n   support, but I\
    \ don't know how to draw it.\n   The talk leaned heavily on blackboard pictures\
    \ of specific\n   connections, but for purposes of this report, I'll try to summarize\n\
    \   the situation in words.  For all simple devices, C must be performed\n   \"\
    elsewhere\"; if the simple device is on the Net via a TIP, C\n   apparently must\
    \ be performed either at the remote host (RH1) where A\n   and G are, or at some\
    \ other remote host (RH2) (which offers, say, the\n   Data Reconfiguration Service).\
    \  Further, negotiations for C may have\n   to be performed by RH1 on the TIP's\
    \ behalf.  Still more complications\n   result from the possible desirability\
    \ of including an additional\n   application (A') and/or an additional graphics\
    \ package (G') on RH2.\n   If the simple device is on the Net via a full-fledged\
    \ local host\n   (LH), then A, G, and C can each potentially be performed at LH\
    \ or RH1\n   -- or RH2 for that matter (\"ship it to an E&S for clipping\").\n\
    \   In the case of smart devices, C can potentially be performed at the\n   device\
    \ itself - - although the TIP may not be able to furnish the\n   extra socket\
    \ pair which one would want in order to handle such cases\n   cleanly.  Finally,\
    \ powerful devices can do G internally but we may\n   well wish to do A and G\
    \ over the Net.  (Again, how the TIP would\n   handle such cases was not clear.)\n\
    \   Jim had presented this discussion for the expressed purpose of\n   getting\
    \ attention focused on the \"ends\" of the protocol pipeline\n   before the meeting\
    \ became totally concerned with the contents of that\n   pipeline.  We responded\
    \ in the only possible manner:\n"
- title: CONNECTION PROTOCOL COMMITTEE
  contents:
  - "CONNECTION PROTOCOL COMMITTEE\n   A committee was designated to formulate a Graphics\
    \ Connection\n   Protocol, the protocol to play an analogous role to that of the\n\
    \   Initial Connection Protocol with respect to the Telnet Protocol.\n   There\
    \ was a clearcut consensus that only device-specific codes should\n   be transmitted\
    \ over Telnet connections unless the committee uncovered\n   overwhelmingly convincing\
    \ arguments to the contrary.  The committee\n   consists of Michener, Bouknight,\
    \ Harslem, and me.  Will Crowther of\n   BBN will be invited to join the committee\
    \ to furnish TIP\n   representation and expertise.\n"
- title: GRAPHICS RESOURCE DOCUMENTATION
  contents:
  - "GRAPHICS RESOURCE DOCUMENTATION\n   Before turning to the protocol specification,\
    \ it should be pointed\n   out that most attendees felt that Resource Notebook-like\n\
    \   documentation on Graphics should be prepared.  Postel volunteered to\n   coordinate\
    \ this effort.  Hosts should have drafts submitted to him,\n   and he will see\
    \ to getting them published as new portion of the\n   Resource Notebook.  Format\
    \ considerations were not discussed, but\n   assumedly the format should imitate\
    \ that of the main Resource\n   Notebook sections.  Call Jon if you have questions\
    \ (213-825-2368).\n"
- title: THE PROTOCOL
  contents:
  - "THE PROTOCOL\n   At the outset of the main protocol discussion, it was agreed\
    \ that a\n   committee would be established to resolve those issues on which a\n\
    \   consensus could not be reached at the meeting, and to prepare a draft\n  \
    \ of the protocol for distribution to the NGG by year's end.  Members\n   of the\
    \ committee are Michener, Meyer, Kelly, Cotton, and Liddle.\n"
- title: ASSUMPTIONS
  contents:
  - "ASSUMPTIONS\n   The following assumptions were agreed upon:\n      1.  There\
    \ shall be a \"virtual screen\" and a Standard Graphics\n      Stream.\n     \
    \ 2.  The origin is in the center.\n      3.  Coordinates are signed, 2's complement\
    \ fractions (-.5 to\n      +.499).\n      4.  The Standrd Graphics Stream will\
    \ consist of 8-bit bytes\n      initially, coordinates are two bytes. ( A \"set\
    \ coordinate size\"\n      operator will be introduced if and when needed.)\n\
    \      5.  Network ASCII will be used for text output, with default to\n     \
    \ upper case where necessary.  Control characters are, for the time\n      being,\
    \ site specific.\n      6.  Where appropriate, operators shall have \"absolute,\"\
    \n      \"relative,\" and \"local\" (to a subpicture) modes.\n      7.  The protocol\
    \ will be organized on a \"levels of complexity\"\n      basis, with level 0 comprising\
    \ operators for simple picture\n      drawing, level 1 comprising operators for\
    \ one level of subpicture\n      definition (\"macros\", or loosely, \"subroutines\"\
    ) and level 2\n      comprising \"viewport\" and \"window\" type operators.\n\
    \   Note that the discussion dealt specifically with graphics OUTPUT.\n   The\
    \ Protocol Committee was also empowered to prepare recommendations\n   for an\
    \ input-side protocol, but first priority is to be attached to\n   the formulation\
    \ of an acceptable output-side protocol.\n   OPERATORS\n   As the Protocol Committee's\
    \ draft is not immediately available, the\n   following list of low-level operators\
    \ (the syntax and semantics of\n   which were discussed at length during the meeting)\
    \ may be of interest\n   here:\n      1. Erase and reset to origin.  This operator\
    \ causes the screen to\n      be erased and the beam to be positioned at the 0,0\
    \ (virtual screen\n      center) point.  A new picture is started.\n      2. Move.\
    \  No line is drawn the beam is positioned to the specified\n      x, y position.\
    \  There are specific operators for \"move relative\",\n      \"move absolute\"\
    \ and \"move local\" modes.\n      3. Draw.  A line (of the current \"linetype\"\
    \ -- see 5, below) is\n      drawn from the present beam position to the specified\
    \ x, y\n      position.  Modes are as with move.  Treatment of the \"off-screen\"\
    \n      condition is at the displaying host's option.\n      4. Point.  Display\
    \ a point at the specified position.  Modes are\n      as with move.\n      5.\
    \ Line type.  Draw lines of the specified type until further\n      notice.  Currently\
    \ defined types are solid (0), dashed (1), dotted\n      (2).  If a requested\
    \ type is not implemented, default to the\n      next-lower-valued type.  After\
    \ an \"erase\", type is solid until\n      changed.\n      6. Line intensity.\
    \  Requests line intensity to be as follows: 0 =\n      off, 128 = normal, 255\
    \ = brightest, intermediate values = map\n      appropriately.  After an \"erase\"\
    , intensity is normal until\n      changed.\n      7. Text.  Cause display of\
    \ a specified number of specified (Net\n      ASCII) characters.  There are specific\
    \ operators for \"return beam\"\n      after last character (to position before\
    \ text display) and \"leave\n      beam\" (wherever it ends up).  Size is to be\
    \ whatever the\n      displaying host considers \"normal\".  Treatment of \"right-hand\n\
    \      margin\" and ASCII controls is host-specified at present.  (A\n      character\
    \ size operator may be specified later.)\n      8. Escape.  If the console is\
    \  of specified type, pass a specified\n      number of bytes directly to it.\n\
    \   Operators for viewports and subpictures were also discussed.\n   Bouknight\
    \ and Kelly prepared an BNF treatment of all points\n   discussed, which will\
    \ appear in the Protocol Committee's draft.\n"
