- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is a revision of [RFC7437] that updates it\
    \ to be\n   consistent with the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) 2.0\n\
    \   changes.  RFC 7437 was based on [RFC3777] that consolidated and\n   updated\
    \ other RFCs that updated that document into a single\n   specification.  The\
    \ result is a complete specification of the process\n   by which members of the\
    \ Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and\n   Internet Engineering Steering Group\
    \ (IESG), some Trustees of the IETF\n   Trust, and some Directors of the IETF\
    \ Administration LLC (IETF LLC),\n   are selected, confirmed, and recalled.\n\
    \   This revision addresses only the changes required for IASA 2.0;\n   should\
    \ the community agree on other changes, they will be addressed\n   in future documents.\n\
    \   Section 2 of [RFC8714] provides further details about the IETF Trust\n   Trustees\
    \ positions that are filled by the IETF Nominating Committee\n   (NomCom).\n \
    \  Section 5 of [RFC8711] provides further details about the IETF LLC\n   Director\
    \ positions that are filled by the NomCom.\n   The following two assumptions continue\
    \ to be true of this\n   specification:\n   1.  The Internet Research Task Force\
    \ (IRTF) and Internet Research\n       Steering Group (IRSG) are not a part of\
    \ the process described\n       here.\n   2.  The organization (and reorganization)\
    \ of the IESG is not a part\n       of the process described here.\n   The time\
    \ frames specified here use IETF meetings as a frame of\n   reference.  The time\
    \ frames assume that the IETF meets three times\n   per calendar year with approximately\
    \ equal amounts of time between\n   them.  The meetings are referred to as the\
    \ First IETF, Second IETF,\n   or Third IETF as needed.\n   The next section lists\
    \ the words and phrases commonly used throughout\n   this document with their\
    \ intended meaning.\n   The majority of this document is divided into four major\
    \ topics as\n   follows:\n   General:  This is a set of rules and constraints\
    \ that apply to the\n      selection and confirmation process as a whole.\n  \
    \ Nominating Committee Selection:  This is the process by which the\n      volunteers\
    \ who will serve on the NomCom are selected.\n   Nominating Committee Operation:\
    \  This is the set of principles,\n      rules, and constraints that guide the\
    \ activities of the NomCom,\n      including the confirmation process.\n   Member,\
    \ Trustee, and Director Recall:  This is the process by which\n      the behavior\
    \ of a sitting member of the IESG, or IAB, or IETF\n      Trust Trustee, or IETF\
    \ LLC Director may be questioned, perhaps\n      resulting in the removal of the\
    \ sitting member.  See Section 2 for\n      a description of what a sitting member\
    \ means for each of these\n      groups.\n   A final section describes how this\
    \ document differs from [RFC3777]\n   and [RFC7437].\n   An appendix of useful\
    \ facts and practices collected from previous\n   NomComs is also included.\n\
    \   This document updates the IAB, IESG, and IAOC Selection,\n   Confirmation,\
    \ and Recall Process to be aligned with IASA 2.0 Model\n   [RFC8711] that creates\
    \ an IETF Administration Limited Liability\n   Company (IETF LLC) managed by a\
    \ Board of Directors (IETF LLC Board).\n   This document obsoletes [RFC7437] and\
    \ [RFC8318].\n"
- title: 2.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.  Definitions\n   The following words and phrases are commonly used throughout\
    \ this\n   document.  They are listed here with their intended meaning for the\n\
    \   convenience of the reader.\n   Candidate:  A nominee who has been selected\
    \ to be considered for\n      confirmation by a confirming body.\n   Confirmed\
    \ Candidate:  A candidate that has been reviewed and approved\n      by a confirming\
    \ body.\n   Nominating Committee Term:  The term begins when its members are\n\
    \      officially announced, which is expected to be prior to the Third\n    \
    \  IETF to ensure it is fully operational at the Third IETF.  The\n      term\
    \ ends at the Third IETF (not three meetings) after the next\n      NomCom's term\
    \ begins.\n   IETF Executive Director:  The person charged with day-to-day\n \
    \     operation of the IETF's administrative functions.  (See\n      Section 4.1\
    \ of [RFC8711]).  Note: This was previously the name of\n      the IETF Secretariat\
    \ position that is now called the \"Managing\n      Director, IETF Secretariat\"\
    .\n   Managing Director, IETF Secretariat:  The person charged with\n      operation\
    \ of the IETF Secretariat function.  (See Section 2 of\n      [RFC3710] and [RFC8717]).\n\
    \   Nominee:  A person who is being or has been considered for one or\n      more\
    \ open positions of the IESG, IAB, IETF Trust Trustee, or IETF\n      LLC.\n \
    \  Sitting Member:  A person who is currently serving as a member of the\n   \
    \   IESG or IAB.\n   Sitting Director:  A person who is currently serving as a\
    \ Director of\n      the IETF LLC.\n   Sitting IETF Trust Trustee:  A person who\
    \ is currently serving as a\n      Trustee of the IETF Trust.\n"

  - "3.  General\n   The following set of rules apply to the process as a whole. \
    \ If\n   necessary, a paragraph discussing the interpretation of each rule is\n\
    \   included.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Completion Due
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Completion Due\n   The completion of the annual process is due within seven\
    \ months.\n   The completion of the annual process is due one month prior to the\n\
    \   Friday of the week before the First IETF.  It is expected to begin at\n  \
    \ least eight months prior to the Friday of the week before the First\n   IETF.\n\
    \   The process officially begins with the announcement of the Chair of\n   the\
    \ committee.  The process officially ends when all confirmed\n   candidates have\
    \ been announced.\n   The annual process is comprised of three major components\
    \ as follows:\n   1.  The selection and organization of the NomCom members.\n\
    \   2.  The selection of candidates by the NomCom.\n   3.  The confirmation of\
    \ the candidates.\n   There is an additional month set aside between when the\
    \ annual\n   process is expected to end and the term of the new candidates is\
    \ to\n   begin.  This time may be used during unusual circumstances to extend\n\
    \   the time allocated for any of the components listed above.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Nominating Committee Principal Functions
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Nominating Committee Principal Functions\n   The principal functions of\
    \ the NomCom are to review each open IESG,\n   IAB, IETF Trust, and IETF LLC Director\
    \ position and to select either\n   its incumbent or a superior candidate.\n \
    \  Although there is no term limit for serving in any IESG, IAB, or IETF\n   Trust\
    \ position, the NomCom may use length of service as one of its\n   criteria for\
    \ evaluating an incumbent.\n   The NomCom does not select the open positions to\
    \ be reviewed; it is\n   instructed as to which positions to review.\n   The NomCom\
    \ will be given the titles of the positions to be reviewed\n   and a brief summary\
    \ of the desired expertise of the candidate that is\n   selected to fill each\
    \ position.\n   Incumbents must notify the NomCom if they wish to be nominated.\n\
    \   The NomCom does not confirm its candidates; it presents its\n   candidates\
    \ to the appropriate confirming body as indicated below.\n   A superior candidate\
    \ is one who the NomCom believes would contribute\n   in such a way as to improve\
    \ or enhance the body to which he or she is\n   nominated.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Positions to Be Reviewed
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Positions to Be Reviewed\n   Approximately one-half of each of the then\
    \ current IESG and IAB\n   positions, one IETF Trust position, and one IETF LLC\
    \ Director\n   position, is selected to be reviewed each year.\n   The intent\
    \ of this rule is to ensure the review of approximately one-\n   half of each\
    \ of the IESG and IAB sitting members, one of the three\n   NomCom-nominated IETF\
    \ LLC Director positions, and one of the three\n   nominated IETF Trust Trustee\
    \ positions, each year.  It is recognized\n   that circumstances may exist that\
    \ will require the NomCom to review\n   more or less than the usual number of\
    \ positions, e.g., if the IESG,\n   IAB, IETF Trust, or IETF LLC Board have reorganized\
    \ prior to this\n   process and created new positions, if there are an odd number\
    \ of\n   current positions, or if a member, a Director, or a Trustee\n   unexpectedly\
    \ resigns.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Term Lengths
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Term Lengths\n   Confirmed IESG and IAB candidates are expected to serve\
    \ at least a\n   two-year term.  The intent of this rule is to ensure that members\
    \ of\n   the IESG and IAB serve the number of years that best facilitates the\n\
    \   review of one-half of the members each year.\n   Confirmed IETF LLC Director\
    \ candidates are expected to serve at least\n   a three-year term, except if a\
    \ nominating or selection body decides\n   to use a shorter term to allow for\
    \ initial staggered appointments.\n   Please refer to Section 6 of [RFC8711] for\
    \ additional guidance on\n   term length and term limits for the IETF LLC Board.\n\
    \   Confirmed IETF Trust Trustee candidates are expected to serve at\n   least\
    \ a three-year term, except if a nominating or selection body\n   decides to use\
    \ a shorter term to allow for initial staggered\n   appointments.  Please refer\
    \ to Section 2 of [RFC8714] for additional\n   guidance on term length and term\
    \ limits for the IETF Trust.\n   The term of a confirmed candidate selected according\
    \ to the mid-term\n   vacancy rules may be less than a full term (two years for\
    \ IESG and\n   IAB, three years for the IETF Trust and IETF LLC), as stated\n\
    \   elsewhere in this document.\n   It is consistent with this rule for the NomCom\
    \ to choose one or more\n   of the currently open positions to which it may assign\
    \ a term of not\n   more than three years in order to ensure the ideal application\
    \ of\n   this rule in the future.\n   It is consistent with this rule for the\
    \ NomCom to choose one or more\n   of the currently open positions that share\
    \ responsibilities with\n   other positions (both those being reviewed and those\
    \ sitting) to\n   which it may assign a term of not more than three years to ensure\n\
    \   that all such members, Directors, or Trustees will not be reviewed at\n  \
    \ the same time.\n   All sitting member terms end during the First IETF meeting\n\
    \   corresponding to the end of the term for which they were confirmed.\n   All\
    \ confirmed candidate terms begin during the First IETF meeting\n   corresponding\
    \ to the beginning of the term for which they were\n   confirmed.\n   For confirmed\
    \ candidates of the IESG, the terms begin no later than\n   when the currently\
    \ sitting members' terms end on the last day of the\n   meeting.  A term may begin\
    \ or end no sooner than the first day of the\n   meeting and no later than the\
    \ last day of the meeting as determined\n   by the mutual agreement of the currently\
    \ sitting member and the\n   confirmed candidate.  A confirmed candidate's term\
    \ may overlap the\n   sitting member's term during the meeting as determined by\
    \ their\n   mutual agreement.\n   For confirmed candidates of the IAB, the terms\
    \ overlap with the terms\n   of the sitting members for the entire week of the\
    \ meeting.\n   For confirmed Trustee candidates of the IETF Trust, the term begins\n\
    \   at the next IETF Trust meeting or as dictated by the policies and\n   procedures\
    \ of the IETF Trust.\n   For confirmed Director candidates of the IETF LLC, the\
    \ term begins at\n   the next appropriate IETF LLC Board meeting or as dictated\
    \ by the\n   policies and procedures of the IETF LLC Board.\n   For candidates\
    \ confirmed under the mid-term vacancy rules, the term\n   begins as soon as possible\
    \ after the confirmation.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Mid-term Vacancies
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Mid-term Vacancies\n   Mid-term vacancies are filled by the same rules\
    \ as documented here\n   with four qualifications, namely:\n   1.  When there\
    \ is only one official NomCom, the body with the mid-\n       term vacancy relegates\
    \ the responsibility to fill the vacancy to\n       it.  If the mid-term vacancy\
    \ occurs during the period of time\n       that the term of the prior year's NomCom\
    \ overlaps with the term\n       of the current year's NomCom, the body with the\
    \ mid-term vacancy\n       must relegate the responsibility to fill the vacancy\
    \ to the prior\n       year's NomCom.\n   2.  If it is the case that the NomCom\
    \ is reconvening to fill the mid-\n       term vacancy, then the completion of\
    \ the candidate selection and\n       confirmation process is due within six weeks,\
    \ with all other time\n       periods otherwise unspecified prorated accordingly.\n\
    \   3.  The confirming body has two weeks from the day it is notified of\n   \
    \    a candidate to reject the candidate, otherwise the candidate is\n       assumed\
    \ to have been confirmed.\n   4.  The term of the confirmed candidate will be\
    \ either:\n       A.  the remainder of the term of the open position if that\n\
    \           remainder is not less than one year or\n       B.  the remainder of\
    \ the term of the open position plus the next\n           two-year term for IESG\
    \ and IAB positions or three-year term\n           for IETF LLC Director and IETF\
    \ Trust positions if that\n           remainder is less than one year.\n   In\
    \ both cases, a year is the period of time from a First IETF meeting\n   to the\
    \ next First IETF meeting.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Confidentiality
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Confidentiality\n   All deliberations and supporting information that relate\

    \ or if the NomCom finds it necessary to call for additional\n   nominees, and\
    \ these nominees indicate a willingness to be considered\n   before the NomCom\
    \ has completed its deliberations.\n   Nominees may choose to ask people to provide\
    \ feedback to the NomCom\n   but should not encourage any public statements of\
    \ support.  NomComs\n   should consider nominee-encouraged lobbying and campaigning\
    \ to be\n   unacceptable behavior.\n   IETF community members are encouraged to\

  - "3.8.  Sitting Members, Directors, and Trustees\n   The following rules apply\
    \ to nominees and candidates who are\n   currently sitting members of the IESG\
    \ or IAB, IETF Trust Trustees, or\n   IETF LLC Directors, and who are not sitting\
    \ in an open position being\n   filled by the NomCom.\n   The confirmation of\
    \ a candidate to an open position does not\n   automatically create a vacancy\
    \ in the IESG, IAB, IETF Trust, or IETF\n   LLC Board position currently occupied\
    \ by the candidate.  The mid-term\n   vacancy cannot exist until, first, the candidate\
    \ formally resigns\n   from the current position and, second, the body with the\
    \ vacancy\n   formally decides for itself that it wants the NomCom to fill the\
    \ mid-\n   term vacancy according to the rules for a mid-term vacancy documented\n\
    \   elsewhere in this document.\n   The resignation should be effective as of\
    \ when the term of the new\n   position begins.  The resignation may remain confidential\
    \ to the\n   IESG, IAB, IETF Trust, IETF LLC Board, and NomCom until the confirmed\n\
    \   candidate is announced for the new position.  The process, according\n   to\
    \ rules set out elsewhere in this document, of filling the seat\n   vacated by\
    \ the confirmed candidate may begin as soon as the vacancy\n   is publicly announced.\n\
    \   Filling a mid-term vacancy is a separate and independent action from\n   the\
    \ customary action of filling open positions.  In particular, a\n   NomCom must\
    \ complete its job with respect to filling the open\n   positions and then separately\
    \ proceed with the task of filling the\n   mid-term vacancy according to the rules\
    \ for a mid-term vacancy\n   documented elsewhere in this document.\n   However,\
    \ the following exception is permitted in the case where the\n   candidate for\
    \ an open position is currently a sitting member of the\n   IAB.  It is consistent\
    \ with these rules for the announcements of a\n   resignation of a sitting member\
    \ of the IAB and of the confirmed\n   candidate for the mid-term vacancy created\
    \ by that sitting member on\n   the IAB to all occur at the same time as long\
    \ as the actual sequence\n   of events that occurred did so in the following order:\n\
    \   1.  The NomCom completes the advice and consent process for the open\n   \
    \    position being filled by the candidate currently sitting on the\n       IAB.\n\
    \   2.  The newly confirmed candidate resigns from their current position\n  \
    \     on the IAB.\n   3.  The IAB Chair (or the Managing Director, IETF Secretariat,\
    \ if no\n       Chair has been named or the vacancy was created via the departure\n\
    \       of the IAB Chair) informs the NomCom of the mid-term vacancy.\n   4. \

- title: 4.2.  Term
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Term\n   The term of a NomCom is expected to be 15 months.\n   It is the\
    \ intent of this rule that the end of a NomCom's term overlap\n   by approximately\
    \ three months the beginning of the term of the next\n   NomCom.\n   The term\
    \ of a NomCom begins when its members are officially\n   announced.  The term\
    \ ends at the Third IETF (not three meetings),\n   i.e., the IETF meeting after\
    \ the next NomCom's term begins.\n   A term is expected to begin at least two\
    \ months prior to the Third\n   IETF to ensure the NomCom has at least one month\
    \ to get organized\n   before preparing for the Third IETF.\n   A NomCom is expected\
    \ to complete any work in progress before it is\n   dissolved at the end of its\
    \ term.\n   During the period of time when the terms of the NomComs overlap, all\n\
    \   mid-term vacancies are to be relegated to the prior year's NomCom.\n   The\
    \ prior year's NomCom has no other responsibilities during the\n   overlap period.\
    \  At all times other than the overlap period, there is\n   exactly one official\
    \ NomCom and it is responsible for all mid-term\n   vacancies.\n   When the prior\
    \ year's NomCom is filling a mid-term vacancy during the\n   period of time that\
    \ the terms overlap, the NomComs operate\n   independently.  However, some coordination\
    \ is needed between them.\n   Since the prior year's Chair is a non-voting advisor\

- title: 5.7.  Voting Member Recall
  contents:
  - "5.7.  Voting Member Recall\n   Any member of the NomCom may propose to the committee\
    \ that any other\n   member except the Chair be recalled.  The process for recalling\
    \ the\n   Chair is defined elsewhere in this document.\n   There are a variety\
    \ of ordinary circumstances that may arise that\n   could result in one or more\
    \ members of the committee being\n   unavailable to complete their assigned duties,\
    \ for example, health\n   concerns, family issues, or a change of priorities at\
    \ work.  A\n   committee member may choose to resign for unspecified personal\n\
    \   reasons.  In addition, the committee may not function well as a group\n  \
    \ because a member may be disruptive or otherwise uncooperative.\n   Regardless\
    \ of the circumstances, if individual committee members\n   cannot work out their\
    \ differences between themselves, the entire\n   committee may be called upon\
    \ to discuss and review the circumstances.\n   If a resolution is not forthcoming,\
    \ a vote may be conducted.  A\n   member may be recalled if at least a quorum\
    \ of all committee members\n   agree, including the vote of the member being recalled.\n\
    \   If a liaison member is recalled, the committee must notify the\n   affected\
    \ organization and must allow a reasonable amount of time for\n   a replacement\
    \ to be identified by the organization before proceeding.\n   If an advisor member\
    \ other than the prior year's Chair is recalled,\n   the committee may choose\
    \ to proceed without the advisor.  In the case\n   of the prior year's Chair,\
    \ the Internet Society President must be\n   notified and the current Chair must\
    \ be allowed a reasonable amount of\n   time to consult with the Internet Society\
    \ President to identify a\n   replacement before proceeding.\n   If a single voting\
    \ volunteer position on the NomCom is vacated,\n   regardless of the circumstances,\
    \ the committee may choose to proceed\n   with only nine voting volunteers at\
    \ its own discretion.  In all other\n   cases, a new voting member must be selected,\
    \ and the Chair must\n   repeat the random selection process including an announcement\
    \ of the\n   iteration prior to the actual selection as stated elsewhere in this\n\
    \   document.\n   A change in the primary affiliation of a voting volunteer during\
    \ the\n   term of the NomCom is not a cause to request the recall of that\n  \
    \ volunteer, even if the change would result in more than two voting\n   volunteers\
    \ with the same affiliation.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.8.  Chair Recall\n   Only the prior year's Chair may request the recall of\

    \   with this document and in the best interests of the IETF community.\n   Any\
    \ member of the committee who has an issue or concern regarding the\n   Chair\
    \ should report it to the prior year's Chair immediately.  The\n   prior year's\
    \ Chair is expected to report it to the Chair immediately.\n   If they cannot\

    \ of the IETF\n   community's consensus of the qualifications required to fill\
    \ the open\n   positions.\n   The intent of this rule is to ensure that the NomCom\
    \ consults with a\n   broad base of the IETF community for input to its deliberations.\
    \  In\n   particular, the NomCom must determine if the desired expertise for\n\
    \   the open positions matches its understanding of the qualifications\n   desired\
    \ by the IETF community.\n   The consultations are permitted to include names\
    \ of nominees, if all\n   parties to the consultation agree to observe the same\
    \ confidentiality\n   rules as the NomCom itself, or the names are public as discussed\
    \ in\n   Section 3.6.  Feedback on individual nominees should always be\n   confidential.\n\
    \   A broad base of the community should include the existing members of\n   the\
    \ IESG and IAB, IETF Trust Trustees, and IETF LLC Directors,\n   especially sitting\
    \ members who share responsibilities with open\n   positions, e.g., co-Area Directors,\

  contents:
  - "5.13.  Consent to Nomination\n   Nominees should be advised that they are being\
    \ considered and must\n   consent to their nomination prior to being chosen as\
    \ candidates.\n   Although the NomCom will make every reasonable effort to contact\
    \ and\n   to remain in contact with nominees, any nominee whose contact\n   information\
    \ changes during the process and who wishes to still be\n   considered should\
    \ inform the NomCom of the changes.\n   A nominee's consent must be written (email\
    \ is acceptable) and must\n   include a commitment to provide the resources necessary\
    \ to fill the\n   open position and an assurance that the nominee will perform\
    \ the\n   duties of the position for which they are being considered in the\n\
    \   best interests of the IETF community.\n   Consenting to a nomination must\
    \ occur prior to a nominee being a\n   candidate and may occur as soon after the\
    \ nomination as needed by the\n   NomCom.\n   Consenting to a nomination must\

- title: 6.  Dispute Resolution Process
  contents:
  - "6.  Dispute Resolution Process\n   The dispute resolution process described here\
    \ is to be used as\n   indicated elsewhere in this document.  Its applicability\
    \ in other\n   circumstances is beyond the scope of this document.\n   The NomCom\
    \ operates under a strict rule of confidentiality.  For this\n   reason, when\
    \ process issues arise, it is best to make every\n   reasonable effort to resolve\
    \ them within the committee.  However,\n   when circumstances do not permit this,\
    \ or no resolution is\n   forthcoming, the process described here is to be used.\n\
    \   The following rules apply to the process:\n   1.  The results of this process\
    \ are final and binding.  There is no\n       appeal.\n   2.  The process begins\
    \ with the submission of a request as described\n       below to the Internet\
    \ Society President.\n   3.  As soon as the process begins, the NomCom may continue\
    \ those\n       activities that are unrelated to the issue to be resolved except\n\
    \       that it must not submit any candidates to a confirming body until\n  \
    \     the issue is resolved.\n   4.  All parties to the process are subject to\
    \ the same\n       confidentiality rules as each member of the NomCom.\n   5.\
    \  The process should be completed within two weeks.\n   The process is as follows:\n\
    \   1.  The party seeking resolution submits a written request (email is\n   \
    \    acceptable) to the Internet Society President detailing the issue\n     \
    \  to be resolved.\n   2.  The Internet Society President appoints an arbiter\
    \ to investigate\n       and resolve the issue.  A self-appointment is permitted.\n\
    \   3.  The arbiter investigates the issue making every reasonable effort\n  \
    \     to understand both sides of the issue.  Since the arbiter is\n       subject\
    \ to the same confidentiality obligations as all NomCom\n       members, all members\
    \ are expected to cooperate fully with the\n       arbiter and to provide all\
    \ relevant information to the arbiter\n       for review.\n   4.  After consultation\
    \ with the two principal parties to the issue,\n       the arbiter decides on\
    \ a resolution.  Whatever actions are\n       necessary to execute the resolution\
    \ are immediately begun and\n       completed as quickly as possible.\n   5. \
    \ The arbiter summarizes the issue, the resolution, and the\n       rationale\
    \ for the resolution for the Internet Society President.\n   6.  In consultation\
    \ with the Internet Society President, the arbiter\n       prepares a report of\
    \ the dispute and its resolution.  The report\n       should include all information\
    \ that in the judgment of the\n       arbiter does not violate the confidentiality\
    \ requirements of the\n       NomCom.\n   7.  The Chair includes the dispute report\

  - "Appendix B.  Changes Since RFC 7437\n   *  Changed all mentions of the Internet\
    \ Administrative Oversight\n      committee (IAOC), and replaced it with the appropriate\
    \ references\n      to the IETF Administration LLC (IETF LLC).  This included\
    \ making\n      changes on an as needed basis to some aspects of the process for\n\
    \      the IETF LLC, in accordance with IASA2.\n   *  Revised definition of IETF\
    \ Executive Director, and added\n      definition of \"Managing Director, IETF\
    \ Secretariat\".  Changed text\n      to \"Managing Director, IETF Secretariat\"\
    \ where appropriate.\n   *  Added references to appropriate IASA2 documents.\n\
    \   *  Modified the Advice and Consent model to enable IESG, IAB, and\n      IETF\
    \ LLC to communicate directly with the NomCom rather than via\n      the Managing\
    \ Director, IETF Secretariat.\n   *  Updated removal text to reflect the new LLC\
    \ rules, which enables\n      removal via the LLC or the IETF recall process,\
    \ except for the\n      ISOC-appointed Director.\n   *  Updated the document to\
    \ clarify that there are members of the IAB\n      and IESG, Trustees of the IETF\
    \ Trust, and Director of the IETF\n      LLC.\n   *  Updated document to also\
    \ specify procedures for the NomCom-\n      appointed IETF Trust Trustees.\n \
    \  *  Revised Abstract and Introduction to provide current context.\n   *  Changed\
    \ \"nominating committee\" to \"NomCom\" throughout the document\n      because\
    \ it is what most use to describe the IETF Nominating\n      Committee.\n   *\
    \  Added that the IETF Trust Trustees and IETF LLC Directors, each\n      may\
    \ appoint a liaison to the NomCom.\n   *  Incorporated the update to RFC 7437\
    \ done by [RFC7776].\n   *  Incorporated the update to RFC 7437 done by [RFC8318]\
    \ and updated\n      it to refer to the IETF Trust and IETF LLC, instead of the\

- title: Appendix C.  Oral Tradition
  contents:
  - "Appendix C.  Oral Tradition\n   Over the years, various NomComs have learned\
    \ through oral tradition\n   passed on by liaisons that there are certain consistencies\
    \ in the\n   process and information considered during deliberations.  Some items\n\
    \   from that oral tradition are collected here to facilitate its\n   consideration\
    \ by future NomComs.\n   1.  It has been found that experience as an IETF Working\
    \ Group Chair\n       or an IRTF Research Group Chair is helpful in giving a nominee\n\
    \       experience of what the job of an Area Director involves.  It also\n  \
    \     helps a NomCom judge the technical, people, and process\n       management\
    \ skills of the nominee.\n   2.  No person should serve both on the IAB and as\
    \ an Area Director,\n       except the IETF Chair whose roles as an IAB member\
    \ and Area\n       Director of the General Area are set out elsewhere.\n   3.\
    \  The strength of the IAB is found in part in the balance of the\n       demographics\
    \ of its members (e.g., national distribution, years\n       of experience, gender,\
    \ etc.), the combined skill set of its\n       members, and the combined sectors\
    \ (e.g., industry, academia,\n       etc.) represented by its members.\n   4.\
    \  There are no term limits for IAB and IESG members explicitly\n       because\
    \ the issue of continuity versus turnover should be\n       evaluated each year\
    \ according to the expectations of the IETF\n       community, as it is understood\
    \ by each NomCom.\n   5.  The number of NomCom members with the same primary affiliation\
    \ is\n       limited in order to avoid the appearance of improper bias in\n  \
    \     choosing the leadership of the IETF.  Rather than defining\n       precise\
    \ rules for how to define \"affiliation\", the IETF community\n       depends\
    \ on the honor and integrity of the participants to make\n       the process work.\n"
- title: Appendix D.  Nominating Committee Timeline
  contents:
  - "Appendix D.  Nominating Committee Timeline\n   This appendix is included for\
    \ the convenience of the reader and is\n   not to be interpreted as the definitive\
    \ timeline.  It is intended to\n   capture the detail described elsewhere in this\
    \ document in one place.\n   Although every effort has been made to ensure the\
    \ description here is\n   consistent with the description elsewhere, if there\
    \ are any conflicts\n   the definitive rule is the one in the main body of this\
    \ document.\n   The only absolute in the timeline rules for the annual process\
    \ is\n   that its completion is due by the First IETF of the year after the\n\
    \   NomCom begins its term.  This is supported by the fact that the\n   confirmed\
    \ candidate terms begin during the week of the First IETF.\n   The overall annual\
    \ process is designed to be completed in seven\n   months.  It is expected to\
    \ start nine months prior to the First IETF.\n   The time is split between three\
    \ major components of the process\n   roughly as follows:\n   1.  First is the\
    \ selection and organization of the committee members.\n       Three months are\
    \ allotted for this process.\n   2.  Second is the selection of the candidates\
    \ by the NomCom.  Four\n       months are allotted for this process.\n   3.  Third\
    \ is the confirmation of the candidates by their respective\n       confirming\
    \ bodies.  Two months are allotted for this process.\n   The following list captures\
    \ the details of the milestones within each\n   component.  For illustrative purposes,\
    \ the list presumes the Friday\n   before the First IETF is March 1.  Numbers\
    \ shown in square brackets\n   indicate the expected number of weeks at each step.\n\
    \   1.   BEGIN Eight Months Prior to First IETF (approx.  June 1);\n        Internet\
    \ Society President appoints the Chair.  The appointment\n        must be done\
    \ no later than the Second IETF or eight months prior\n        to the First IETF,\
    \ whichever comes first.  The Chair must be\n        announced and recognized\
    \ during a plenary session of the Second\n        IETF. [0]\n   2.   The Chair\
    \ establishes and announces milestones to ensure the\n        timely selection\
    \ of the NomCom members. [1]\n   3.   The Chair contacts the IESG, IAB, and Internet\
    \ Society Board of\n        Trustees, IETF Trust, and IETF LLC and requests a\
    \ liaison.  The\n        Chair contacts the prior year's Chair and requests an\
    \ advisor.\n        The Chair obtains the list of IESG, IAB, IETF Trust, and IETF\n\
    \        LLC open positions and descriptions from the chairs of each\n       \
    \ group. [0]\n   4.   The Chair announces the solicitation for voting volunteer\n\
    \        members that must remain open for at least 30 days.  The\n        announcement\
    \ must be done no later than seven months and two\n        weeks prior to the\
    \ First IETF (approx.  June 15). [6]\n   5.   After the solicitation closes, the\
    \ Chair announces the pool of\n        volunteers and the date of the random selection,\
    \ which must be\n        at least one week in the future.  The announcement must\
    \ be done\n        no later than six months and two weeks prior to the First IETF\n\
    \        (approx.  July 15). [1]\n   6.   On the appointed day, the random selection\
    \ occurs and the Chair\n        announces the members of the committee and the\
    \ one week\n        challenge period.  The announcement must be done no later\
    \ than\n        six months and one week prior to the First IETF (approx.  July\n\
    \        22). [1]\n   7.   During the challenge period, the Chair contacts each\
    \ of the\n        committee members and confirms their availability to\n     \
    \   participate.  [0]\n   8.   After the challenge period closes, the Chair announces\
    \ the\n        members of the committee and its term begins.  The announcement\n\
    \        must be done no later than six months prior to the First IETF\n     \
    \   (approx.  August 1). [1]\n   9.   The committee has one month during which\
    \ it is to self-organize\n        in preparation for completing its assigned duties.\
    \  This must be\n        done no later than five months prior to the First IETF\
    \ (approx.\n        September 15). [6]\n   10.  END the Committee Member Selection\
    \ Process; BEGIN the Selection\n        of Candidates; Time is at least five months\
    \ prior to the First\n        IETF (approx.  September 22). [0]\n   11.  The Chair\
    \ establishes and announces the milestones to ensure the\n        timely selection\
    \ of the candidates, including a call for\n        nominations for the open positions.\
    \  The announcement must be\n        done no later than five months prior to the\
    \ First IETF (approx.\n        October 1). [1]\n   12.  Over the next three months,\
    \ the NomCom collects input and\n        deliberates.  It should plan to conduct\
    \ interviews and other\n        consultations during the Third IETF.  The committee\
    \ is due to\n        complete its candidate selection no later than two months\
    \ prior\n        to the First IETF (approx.  January 1). [17]\n   13.  END the\
    \ Selection of Candidates; BEGIN the Confirmation of\n        Candidates; Time\
    \ is at least two months prior to the First IETF\n        (approx.  January 1).\
    \ [0]\n   14.  The committee presents its candidates to their respective\n   \
    \     confirming bodies.  The presentation must be done no later than\n      \
    \  two months prior to the First IETF (approx.  January 1). [0]\n   15.  The confirming\
    \ bodies have one month to deliberate and, in\n        communication with the\
    \ NomCom, accept or reject candidates. [4]\n   16.  The Chair notifies and advises\
    \ unsuccessful nominees that they\n        have not been selected. [1]\n   17.\
    \  The Chair announces the confirmed candidates.  The announcement\n        must\
    \ be done no later than one month prior to the First IETF\n        (approx.  February\
    \ 1). [4]\n"
