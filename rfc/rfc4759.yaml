  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a new parameter \"enumdi\" for the \"tel\"\
    \ Uniform\n   Resource Identifier (URI) to support the handling of ENUM queries\
    \ in\n   Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) network elements.  A VoIP network\n\
    \   element may receive a URI containing an E.164 number, where that URI\n   contains\
    \ an \"enumdi\" parameter.  The presence of the \"enumdi\"\n   parameter indicates\
    \ that an ENUM query has already been performed on\n   the E.164 number by a previous\
    \ VoIP network element.  Equally, if a\n   VoIP network element sends such a URI,\
    \ it asserts that an ENUM query\n   has been carried out on this number.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   VoIP network elements (including User Agent Servers and\
    \ User Agent\n   Clients) may be set up in different ways to handle E.164 [3]\
    \ numbers\n   during call setup, depending on the capabilities provided.  One\n\
    \   common approach is to query ENUM as defined in RFC 3761 [4], and to\n   use\
    \ the set of NAPTR resource records that is returned.\n   If the ENUM query leads\
    \ to a result, the call is set up accordingly.\n   If the ENUM query does not\
    \ lead finally to a result, another database\n   may be queried and/or the call\
    \ may finally be routed to the Public\n   Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). \
    \ In doing so, the call may be\n   routed to another VoIP network element.  To\
    \ indicate in signalling to\n   this next VoIP element that an ENUM query has\
    \ already been made for\n   the \"tel\" URI (specified in RFC 3966 [5]), the \"\
    enumdi\" parameter is\n   used, to prevent the next VoIP network element from\
    \ repeating\n   redundant queries.\n"

    par\" production defined in the ABNF of RFC 3966 [5].\n   par =/ enum-dip-indicator\n\
    \   enum-dip-indicator = \";enumdi\"\n   The enum-dip-indicator is an optional\
    \ parameter for the \"tel\" URI.\n   Note also that enum-dip-indicator can appear\
    \ at most once in any\n   \"tel\" URI.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Options for ENUM Domain Providers\n   A domain provider can, at its choosing,\
    \ populate a NAPTR record with\n   a \"tel\" URI that contains the enum dip indicator.\
    \  This would, as a\n   consequence of the rules stated below, inform the client\
    \ that it\n   should not bother performing a query and pass the request on.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Client Behaviour for VoIP Network Elements
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Client Behaviour for VoIP Network Elements\n   This section discusses how\
    \ a VoIP network element handles a received\n   \"tel\" URI that contains the\
    \ \"enumdi\" parameter or has queried ENUM in\n   e164.arpa. for a given E.164\
    \ number.\n"
- title: 4.2.1.  Handling a URI with the "enumdi" Parameter
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  Handling a URI with the \"enumdi\" Parameter\n   If a VoIP network element\
    \ receives a \"tel\" URI containing the\n   \"enumdi\" parameter, the VoIP network\
    \ element SHOULD NOT retrieve the\n   related information for this number from\
    \ ENUM in e164.arpa. even if\n   it would normally do so.\n   Note that the recipient\
    \ network element may reasonably choose to\n   query ENUM if it does not have\
    \ a trust relationship with the\n   immediate sender of the URI.\n   If the \"\
    tel\" URI (received from a trusted entity) is to be passed to\n   the next network\
    \ element, the VoIP network element MUST pass on the\n   received URI containing\
    \ the \"enumdi\" parameter unchanged.\n   If, however, the URI has been received\
    \ from an untrusted entity, then\n   the recipient entity may either strip it\
    \ before sending the URI\n   onwards or instead carry out its own ENUM query and\
    \ add the parameter\n   accordingly to the URI (see next).\n"

    \ queries ENUM in e164.arpa. for a given\n   E.164 number and the result of the\
    \ query is DNS error code 3\n   (commonly known as \"NXDOMAIN\"), then if that\
    \ network element chooses\n   to pass the call to another network element by using\
    \ a \"tel\" URI, the\n   \"enumdi\" parameter MUST be set.\n"
- title: 4.2.3.  Handling a URI Retrieved from ENUM
  contents:
  - "4.2.3.  Handling a URI Retrieved from ENUM\n   When a VoIP network element queries\
    \ ENUM in e164.arpa. for a given\n   E.164 number and either:\n   o  the result\
    \ of the query includes a NAPTR resource record\n      containing a \"tel\" URI\
    \ that has the same E.164 number, or\n   o  the result of the query includes a\
    \ NAPTR resource record\n      containing a \"tel\" URI with the \"enumdi\" parameter\
    \ set,\n   then if that retrieved \"tel\" URI is chosen to be passed to another\n\
    \   network element, the sending VoIP network element MUST pass on the\n   retrieved\
    \ URI with the \"enumdi\" parameter set.\n   When a VoIP network element queries\
    \ ENUM in e164.arpa. for a given\n   E.164 number and the result is a \"tel\"\
    \ URI with a different E.164\n   number that lacks the enum dip indicator, the\
    \ client can either\n   perform another query against that number or pass the\
    \ request on, as\n   a matter of local policy.\n"

  - "5.  Examples\n   a.  A VoIP network element called server.example.com receives\
    \ a \"tel\"\n       URI tel:+441632960038.  The VoIP network element queries the\
    \ DNS\n       for NAPTR resource records in 8.3.0.0.6.9.2.3.6.1.4.4.e164.arpa.,\n\
    \       and gets an error response with code = 3 (commonly known as\n       \"\
    NXDOMAIN\").  The VoIP network element decides to route the call\n       to the\
    \ PSTN via another VoIP network element called\n       gw.example.com.\n     \
    \     It therefore signals to the next VoIP network element with:\n          \
    \   tel:+441632960038;enumdi\n          or (using the procedures of RFC 3261 [6]\
    \ section 19.1.6):\n             sip:+441632960038;enumdi@gw.example.com;user=phone\n\
    \   b.  A VoIP network element called server.example.com receives a \"tel\"\n\
    \       URI tel:+441632960038.  The VoIP network element queries the DNS\n   \
    \    for NAPTR resource records in 8.3.0.0.6.9.2.3.6.1.4.4.e164.arpa.,\n     \
    \  and receives the same \"tel\" URI in reply (i.e.,\n       tel:+441632960038).\n\
    \       The VoIP network element decides to route the call to the PSTN\n     \
    \  via another VoIP network element called gw.example.com.\n          It therefore\
    \ signals to this next VoIP network element with:\n             tel:+441632960038;enumdi\n\
    \          or (using the procedures of RFC 3261 [6] section 19.1.6):\n       \

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   In addition to those security implications discussed\
    \ in the \"tel\" URI\n   [5] specification, there are new security implications\
    \ associated\n   with the defined parameter.\n   If the \"enumdi\" is illegally\
    \ inserted into the \"tel\" URI when the\n   signalling message carrying the \"\
    tel\" URI is en route to the\n   destination entity, the call may be routed to\
    \ the PSTN network,\n   incurring unexpected charges or causing a downstream VoIP\
    \ network\n   element to reject the call setup.  Many network elements that will\n\
    \   process URIs containing this parameter will maintain trust\n   relationships\
    \ with others.  If such a URI is received from an entity\n   outside the trust\
    \ boundary of the recipient, then that recipient\n   entity may reasonably ignore\
    \ it and make an ENUM query itself.  In so\n   doing, it can avoid this potential\
    \ attack.\n   It is less a problem if the \"enumdi\" is illegally removed.  An\n\
    \   additional ENUM query may be performed to retrieve the routing number\n  \
    \ information and have the \"enumdi\" included again.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that\
    \ protocols carrying the \"tel\" URI ensure\n   message integrity during the message\
    \ transfer between the two\n   communicating network elements so as to detect\
    \ any unauthorised\n   changes to the content of the \"tel\" URI and other information.\n"

    \ Registry [7].\n"
