  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)\n\
    \   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.\n   In\
    \ particular, it defines objects for managing MAC bridges based on\n   the IEEE\
    \ 802.1D-1998 standard between Local Area Network (LAN)\n   segments.  Provisions\
    \ are made for the support of transparent\n   bridging.  Provisions are also made\
    \ so that these objects apply to\n   bridges connected by subnetworks other than\
    \ LAN segments.\n   The MIB module presented in this memo is a translation of\
    \ the\n   BRIDGE-MIB defined in RFC 1493 to the SMIv2 syntax.\n   This memo obsoletes\
    \ RFC 1493.\n"

- title: 3.  Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview\n   A common device present in many networks is the Bridge.  This\
    \ device\n   is used to connect Local Area Network segments below the network\n\
    \   layer.\n   There are two major modes defined for this bridging: transparent\
    \ and\n   source route.  The transparent method of bridging is defined in the\n\
    \   IEEE 802.1D specification [IEEE8021D].  This memo defines those\n   objects\
    \ needed for the management of a bridging entity that operates\n   in the transparent\
    \ mode, as well as some objects that apply to all\n   types of bridges.\n   To\
    \ be consistent with IAB directives and good engineering practices,\n   an explicit\
    \ attempt was made to keep this MIB module as simple as\n   possible.  This was\
    \ accomplished by applying the following criteria\n   to objects proposed for\
    \ inclusion:\n   1. Start with a small set of essential objects and add only as\n\
    \      further objects are needed.\n   2. Require that objects be essential for\
    \ either fault or\n      configuration management.\n   3. Consider evidence of\
    \ current use and/or utility.\n   4. Limit the total number of objects.\n   5.\
    \ Exclude objects that are simply derivable from others in this or\n      other\
    \ MIB modules.\n   6. Avoid causing critical sections to be heavily instrumented.\
    \  The\n      guideline that was followed is one counter per critical section\n\
    \      per layer.\n"

    \ is\n   bridging, or whether bridging is only a subset of the device's\n   functionality.\n\
    \   As explained in Section 3.1, full support for the 802.1D management\n   objects\
    \ requires that the SNMPv2-MIB objects sysDescr and sysUpTime\n   be implemented.\
    \  Note that compliance with the current SNMPv2-MIB\n   module requires additional\
    \ objects and notifications to be\n   implemented, as specified in RFC 3418 [RFC3418].\n"
- title: 3.2.2  Relationship to the IF-MIB
  contents:
  - "3.2.2  Relationship to the IF-MIB\n   The IF-MIB [RFC2863] defines managed objects\
    \ for managing network\n   interfaces.  A network interface is thought of as being\
    \ attached to a\n   `subnetwork'.  Note that this term is not to be confused with\n\
    \   `subnet', which refers to an addressing partitioning scheme used in\n   the\
    \ Internet suite of protocols.  The term 'segment' is used in this\n   memo to\
    \ refer to such a subnetwork, whether it be an Ethernet\n   segment, a 'ring',\
    \ a WAN link, or even an X.25 virtual circuit.\n   As explained in Section 3.1,\
    \ full support for the 802.1D management\n   objects requires that the IF-MIB\
    \ objects ifIndex, ifType, ifDescr,\n   ifPhysAddress, and ifLastChange are implemented.\
    \  Note that\n   compliance to the current IF-MIB module requires additional objects\n\
    \   and notifications to be implemented as specified in RFC 2863\n   [RFC2863].\n\
    \   Implicit in this BRIDGE-MIB is the notion of ports on a bridge.  Each\n  \
    \ of these ports is associated with one interface of the 'interfaces'\n   subtree,\
    \ and in most situations, each port is associated with a\n   different interface.\
    \  However, there are situations in which multiple\n   ports are associated with\
    \ the same interface.  An example of such a\n   situation would be several ports,\
    \ each corresponding, one-to-one,\n   with several X.25 virtual circuits that\
    \ are all on the same\n   interface.\n   Each port is uniquely identified by a\
    \ port number.  A port number has\n   no mandatory relationship to an interface\
    \ number, but in the simple\n   case, a port number will have the same value as\
    \ the corresponding\n   interface's interface number.  Port numbers are in the\
    \ range\n   (1..dot1dBaseNumPorts).\n   Some entities perform other functionalities\
    \ as well as bridging\n   through the sending and receiving of data on their interfaces.\
    \  In\n   such situations, only a subset of the data sent/received on an\n   interface\
    \ is within the domain of the entity's bridging\n   functionality.  This subset\
    \ is considered to be delineated according\n   to a set of protocols, with some\
    \ protocols being bridged, and other\n   protocols not being bridged.  For example,\
    \ in an entity that\n   exclusively performs bridging, all protocols would be\
    \ considered as\n   bridged, whereas in an entity that performs IP routing on\
    \ IP\n   datagrams and only bridges other protocols, only the non-IP data\n  \
    \ would be considered as having been bridged.\n   Thus, this BRIDGE-MIB (and in\
    \ particular, its counters) are\n   applicable only to that subset of the data\
    \ on an entity's interfaces\n   that is sent/received for a protocol being bridged.\
    \  All such data is\n   sent/received via the ports of the bridge.\n"

    \       DESCRIPTION\n           \"A Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) timer in units\
    \ of 1/100\n           seconds.  Several objects in this MIB module represent\n\
    \           values of timers used by the Spanning Tree Protocol.\n           In\
    \ this MIB, these timers have values in units of\n           hundredths of a second\
    \ (i.e., 1/100 secs).\n           These timers, when stored in a Spanning Tree\
    \ Protocol's\n           BPDU, are in units of 1/256 seconds.  Note, however,\
    \ that\n           802.1D-1998 specifies a settable granularity of no more\n \
    \          than one second for these timers.  To avoid ambiguity,\n          \
    \ a conversion algorithm is defined below for converting\n           between the\
    \ different units, which ensures a timer's\n           value is not distorted\
    \ by multiple conversions.\n           To convert a Timeout value into a value\
    \ in units of\n           1/256 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:\n\
    \               b = floor( (n * 256) / 100)\n           where:\n             \
    \  floor   =  quotient [ignore remainder]\n               n is the value in 1/100\
    \ second units\n               b is the value in 1/256 second units\n        \
    \   To convert the value from 1/256 second units back to\n           1/100 seconds,\
    \ the following algorithm should be used:\n               n = ceiling( (b * 100)\
    \ / 256)\n           where:\n               ceiling = quotient [if remainder is\
    \ 0], or\n                         quotient + 1 [if remainder is nonzero]\n  \
    \             n is the value in 1/100 second units\n               b is the value\
    \ in 1/256 second units\n           Note: it is important that the arithmetic\
    \ operations are\n           done in the order specified (i.e., multiply first,\n\
    \           divide second).\"\n       SYNTAX      Integer32\n   -- ----------------------------------------------------------\

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB module\n   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.\
    \  Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n\
    \   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment\
    \ without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.\n\
    \   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n  \
    \ MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable\
    \ in some network environments.  It is thus important to\n   control even GET\
    \ and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values\
    \ of these objects when sending them over\n   the network via SNMP.\n   These\
    \ are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   o  The writable\
    \ objects dot1dStpPriority, dot1dStpBridgeMaxAge,\n      dot1dStpBridgeHelloTime,\
    \ dot1dStpBridgeForwardDelay,\n      dot1dStpPortPriority, dot1dStpPortEnable,\
    \ dot1dStpPortPathCost,\n      and dot1dStpPortPathCost32 influence the spanning\
    \ tree protocol.\n      Unauthorized write access to these objects can cause the\
    \ spanning\n      tree protocol to compute other default topologies or it can\
    \ change\n      the speed in which the spanning tree protocol reacts to failures.\n\
    \   o  The writable object dot1dTpAgingTime controls how fast\n      dynamically-learned\
    \ forwarding information is aged out.  Setting\n      this object to a large value\
    \ may simplify forwarding table\n      overflow attacks.\n   o  The writable dot1dStaticTable\
    \ provides a filtering mechanism\n      controlling to which ports frames originating\
    \ from a specific\n      source may be forwarded.  Write access to this table\
    \ can be used\n      to turn provisioned filtering off or to add filters to prevent\n\
    \      rightful use of the network.\n   o  The readable objects defined in the\
    \ BRIDGE-MIB module provide\n      information about the topology of a bridged\
    \ network and the\n      attached active stations.  The addresses listed in the\n\
    \      dot1dTpFdbTable usually reveal information about the manufacturer\n   \
    \   of the MAC hardware, which can be useful information for mounting\n      other\
    \ specific attacks.\n   o  The two notifications newRoot and topologyChange are\
    \ emitted\n      during spanning tree computation and may trigger management\n\
    \      systems to inspect the status of bridges and to recompute internal\n  \
    \    topology information.  Hence, forged notifications may cause\n      management\
    \ systems to perform unnecessary computations and to\n      generate additional\
    \ SNMP traffic directed to the bridges in a\n      network.  Therefore, forged\
    \ notifications may be part of a denial\n      of service attack.\n   SNMP versions\
    \ prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself\
    \ is secure (for example by using IPSec),\n   even then, there is no control as\
    \ to who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers\
    \ consider the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see\
    \ [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic\
    \ mechanisms (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of\
    \ SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED\
    \ to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n\
    \   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance\
    \ of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects\
    \ only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET\
    \ or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"
