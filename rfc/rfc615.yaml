    \ Pathname Syntax\nThere seems to be an increasing call for a Network Standard\
    \ Data Pathname\n(NSDP); that is, a standardized means of referring to a specific\
    \ location\nfor/of a collection of bits somewhere on the Network.\nThe reasons\
    \ for a standard or virtual anything have been discussed, at\nlength, elsewhere\
    \ and will not be elaborated upon here. Rather than\nattack the entire issue of\
    \ virtual pathnames, I wish only to propose a\nstandardized SYNTAX for specifying\
    \ pathnames. Such a standard will be\nuseful for 1) users who are unfamiliar with\
    \ a site or who use several\ndifferent sites and do not want to have to remember\
    \ each site's\nidiosynchracies, 2) programs accessing data at several other sites,\
    \ and\n3) documentation:\nThe syntax allows the user to specify the necessary\
    \ network, host,\nperipheral device, directory, file, type, and site-specific\
    \ fields.\nAdding other fields, as needed, is expected to be quite simple.\nFirst\
    \ the BNF:\n   <NSDP> ::= % <bulk> <cr><lf>\n   <bulk> ::= <field> / <field> <bulk>\n\
    \   <field> ::= <key> <L-delim> <name> <R-delim>\n   <key> ::= NETWORK / HOST\
    \ / PERIPHERAL/ DIRECTORY /\n             FILE / TYPE / SITEPARM / N / H / P /\
    \ D / F /\n             T / S\n<L-delim> ::= any printable character that is not\
    \ in the\n              succeeding <name> field and that is\n              acceptable\
    \ to the object site: For visual\n              aesthetics and to facilitate human\
    \ parsing,\n              anytime <L-delim> is a left-bracket\n              character\
    \ (<, [, (, _), <R-delim> must be\n              the complementary right-bracket\
    \ character\n              (>, ], ), |).\n<name> ::=    any sequence of characters\
    \ acceptable to the\n              object site. This is the actual data field\n\
    \              with the file, directory, device (or\n              whatever) name.\n\
    <R-delim> ::= Either 1) the same character as <L-delim> or\n              2) if\
    \ the <L-delim> character is a\n              left-bracket character (<, [, (,\
    \ _) then its\n              complementary right-bracket (>, ], ), |).\n<cr> ::=\
    \      carriage-return\n<lf> ::=      line-feed\nAnd some elaboration:\nThe syntax\
    \ allows <name> fields to be an arbitrary number of rs long.\nCase is irrelevant\
    \ to the syntax, though some sites will care about case\nin <name> fields:\n<Key>\
    \ indicates what part of the pathname the next <name> is going to\nrefer to: The\
    \ single-character keys are abbreviations for the respective\nfull-word keys:\n\
    <Fields> ARE order dependent, but defaulted ones may be omitted. The\norder is\
    \ as indicated for <key>s: That is, Network, Host, ..: Siteparm:\nFields may be\
    \ repeated, as appropriate for the object site; that is,\nmultiple Directory fields,\
    \ etc:\nThe validity of any combination of <field>s is entirely site-dependent:\n\
    For example, if a site will accept it, an NSDP with a Host field, and\nnothing\
    \ more, is permissible:\n<delim> is used to delimit the beginning and end of the\
    \ <name> field:\nExplanation of <key>s:\n       NETWORK or N:   Currently, only\
    \ ARPA is defined.\n       HOST or H:      Reference to host, by official name\
    \ or\n                       nickname or number: The default radix is\n      \
    \                 ten; a numeric string ending with \"H\"\n                  \
    \     indicates hexadecimal, \"O\"(oh) indicates\n                       octal,\
    \ and (gratuitously) \"D\" indicates\n                       decimal:\n      PERIPHERAL\
    \ or P: Peripheral device being referred to:\n      DIRECTORY or D:  Name of a\
    \ directory which contains a\n                       pointer to the entity (directory\
    \ or\n                       filename) specified in the following\n          \
    \             <field>:\n      FILE or F:       Basic name of the file or data\
    \ set:\n      TYPE or T:       Optional modifier to filename: (Tenex\n       \
    \                calls it the extension.)\n      SITEPARM or S:   A parameter,\
    \ such as an access\n                       specification or version number, peculiar\n\
    \                       to the object site. The content of the\n             \
    \          <name> field must serve to identify what\n                       Siteparm\
    \ is involved. Each site will be\n                       responsible for defining\
    \ the syntax of\n                       Siteparm <name>s it will accept.\nSome\
    \ reserved PERIPHERAL <name>s:\n      DISK or DSK:     Immediately accessible,\
    \ direct-access\n                       storage.\n      ONLINE or ONL:    Whatever\
    \ immediately-accessible (measured\n                        in fractions of a\
    \ second) storage the\n                        user accesses by default; usually\
    \ disk:\n      TAPE or TAP:      Industry-compatible magnetic tape:\n      TAPE7\
    \ or TP7:     7-Track industry compatible tape:\n      TAPE9 or TP9:     9-Track\
    \ industry compatible tape:\n      DECTAPE or DEC:   DEC Tape.\n      OFFLINE\
    \ or OFF:   Any tertiary storage; usually tape,\n                        though\
    \ \"devices\" like the Datacomputer\n                        are permissible:\
    \ The user should expect\n                        to wait minutes or hours before\
    \ being\n                        able to access OFFLINE files:\n      PRINTER\
    \ or PTR:   Any available line-printer:\n      DOCPRINTER or DOC:Upper-lower case\
    \ line printer, preferably\n                        with 8 1/2\" X 11\" unlined\
    \ paper.\n      PAPER or PAP:     Paper tape.\n      PUNCH or PUN:     Standard\
    \ 8O-column card punch.\n      READER or RDR:    Standard 80-column card reader:\n\
    \      OPERATOR or OPR:  System Operator's console.\n      CONSULTANT or CON:\
    \ On-line consultant.\nDefaults:\nDefaults will generally be context dependent.\
    \ Consequently, the following\ndefaults are offered only as guidelines:\n    \
    \  Network:    ARPA\n      Host:       The host interpreting the NVP\n      Peripheral:\
    \ ONLINE (DISK)\n      Directory:  The user's current \"working\" directory,\n\
    \                  usually set by the logon process:\n      Filename:    None.\n\
    \      Type:        None.\n      Siteparm:     None.\nGeneral Comments\nThe only\
    \ field that must be considered in relation to any host's current\nsyntax is the\
    \ escape-to-NVP field (The per-cent sign as the first\ncharacter of a pathname\
    \ specification): It is not currently known to\nconflict with any host's syntax:\n\
    Exclamation mark (!) is the only other character that seems permissible\n(on the\
    \ assumption that the character should be a graphic): Its use would\ncause minor\
    \ problems at Multics; but more importantly as a graphic, it is\ntoo similar to\
    \ the numeral \"1\":\nThe syntax is intended to be adequate for all hosts, so\
    \ any given portion\nof it may be inappropriate for any given host.\nA site is\
    \ expected to permit specifications in a given field iff that\nsite already has\
    \ a way of accepting the same information:\nI believe that any modifications to\
    \ the syntax will be graceful\nadditions, rather than wholesale redesign, and\
    \ thus can be deferred for a\nwhile. Currently, any undefined attributes must\
    \ be specified in a\nSiteparm field:\nPerhaps Version, Access protection and Accounting,\
    \ as well as other types\nof information, should be made standard <key>s, rather\
    \ than buried as\nSiteparms. I expect that the next version of the NSDP Syntax\n\
    specification will include them as <key>s, but I would like to wait for\nsome\
    \ comments from the community.\nThe syntax does not currently allow addressing\
    \ any collection of bits\nsmaller than a file: This can be remedied by adding\
    \ PAGE, BYTE and other\n<key>s; but, again, I would like to solicit some comments\
    \ first:\nDisclaimer\nA pathname specified in the proposed syntax is fairly easy\
    \ to type but is\nquite ugly to read: So, at the expense of design cleanliness,\
    \ the\n<L-delim>/<R-delim> syntax was modified in an attempt to remedy the\nproblem\
    \ somewhat: As you will see below, it is only partially successful.\nThe first\
    \ draft of this document had a syntax that was a mix of Tenex and\nMultics conventions:\
    \ That is,\n       (Network)[Host]Peripheral:Directory>Filename:Type;Siteparm\n\
    Though visually more attractive and generally quicker to type, it lacks\nextensibility.\
    \ For example, adding Version number or Access protection as\nstandard fields\
    \ would be difficult:\nIt is suggested that human interfaces be built to translate\
    \ to/from NSDP\nsyntax and the user's standard environment.\nSome sample pathnames:\n\
    %H[ISI]D<DCROCKER>F(MESSAGE)T/TXT/S(P77O4O4)<cr><lf> refers to my\nprotected message\
    \ file at ISI (<DCROCKER>MESSAGE:TXT;P77O4O4).\n%H/OFFICE-l/D>JOURNAL>F<l8659>T.NLS.<cr><lf>\
    \ refers to NIC Journal\ndocument #18659 (Tenex file <JOURNAL>l8659:NLS):\n%H/65/D.ARP061.D.LAD:F.DOCUMENT.<cr><lf>\
    \ refers to a file\nARPO6l:LAD.DOCUMENT at UCLA-CCN. Note the use of multiple\
    \ Directory\nfields.\n%H[540]D//D>udd>D>Comp=net>D>Map>F(Mail)<cr><lf> refers\
    \ to file\nCompNet>Map>Mail at Mit-Multics. Note that the initial NSPD Directory\n\
    <name> field is empty. This conforms to Multics' method of starting at\nthe top\
    \ of its directory structure:\nI would like to thank Jon Postel, Vint Cerf, Jim\
    \ White, Charlie Kline,\nKen Pogran, Jerry Burchfiel and Tom Boynton for their\
    \ suggestions.\n"
