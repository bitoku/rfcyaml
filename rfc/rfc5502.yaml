  - "1.  Introduction\n   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) IMS (IP Multimedia\n\
    \   Subsystem) uses SIP (RFC 3261 [2]) as its main signaling protocol.\n   (For\
    \ more information on the IMS, a detailed description can be found\n   in 3GPP\
    \ TS 23.228 [9] and 3GPP TS 24.229 [11].) 3GPP has identified\n   issues with\
    \ the linking in of a SIP application server that are most\n   appropriately resolved\
    \ by defining a new SIP P-header, according to\n   the procedures in RFC 3427\
    \ [5].\n   The remainder of this document is organized as follows.  Section 4\n\
    \   outlines the problem by using particular service scenarios, and\n   Section\
    \ 5 discusses the requirements derived from these scenarios.\n   Section 6 defines\
    \ the P-Served-User header field, which meets those\n   requirements, Section\
    \ 7 specifies the proxy behavior for the new\n   header field, and Section 8 discusses\
    \ the applicability and scope of\n   this new header field.  Section 9 registers\
    \ the P-Served-User header\n   field with the IANA, and Section 10 discusses the\
    \ security properties\n   of the environment where this header field is intended\
    \ to be used.\n"

- title: 4.1.  General
  contents:
  - "4.1.  General\n   In the 3GPP IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem), the S-CSCF (Serving\
    \ CSCF)\n   is a SIP proxy that serves as a registrar and handles originating\
    \ and\n   terminating session states for users allocated to it.  This means\n\
    \   that any call that is originated by a specific user or any call that\n   is\
    \ terminated to that specific user will pass through the S-CSCF that\n   is allocated\
    \ to that user.\n   At the moment that an S-CSCF is allocated for a specific user,\
    \ a user\n   profile is downloaded to the S-CSCF from the HSS (Home Subscriber\n\
    \   Server) over the Cx interface, see 3GPP TS 29.228 [12].  This user\n   profile\
    \ tells the S-CSCF whether the user is allowed to originate or\n   terminate calls\
    \ or whether an AS needs to be linked in over the ISC\n   interface.  The user\
    \ profile information that determines whether a\n   particular initial request\
    \ needs to be sent to a particular AS is\n   called the initial Filter Criteria\
    \ (iFC), see for example 3GPP TS\n   23.218 [8].\n   For an S-CSCF to be able\
    \ to meet its responsibilities, it needs to\n   determine on which user's behalf\
    \ it is performing its tasks and which\n   session case is applicable for the\
    \ particular request.  (For a\n   definition of session case, see 3GPP TS 29.228\
    \ [12]).  The session\n   case distinguishes the originating and terminating call\
    \ cases and\n   determines whether or not the particular user is registered.\n\
    \   When the S-CSCF determines that for an incoming initial request the\n   originating\
    \ call case applies, it determines the served user by\n   looking at the P-Asserted-Identity\
    \ header field (RFC 3325 [4]), which\n   carries the network asserted identity\
    \ of the originating user.  When,\n   after processing the iFC for this initial\
    \ request, the S-CSCF decides\n   to forward the request to an AS, the AS has\
    \ to go through a similar\n   process of determining the session case and the\
    \ served user.  Since\n   it should come to the same conclusion that this is an\
    \ originating\n   session case, it also has to look at the P-Asserted-Identity\
    \ header\n   field to determine the served user.\n   When the S-CSCF determines\
    \ that for an incoming initial request the\n   terminating call case applies,\
    \ it determines the served user by\n   looking at the Request-URI (RFC 3261 [2]),\
    \ which carries the identity\n   of the intended terminating user.  When, after\
    \ processing the iFC for\n   this initial request, the S-CSCF decides to forward\
    \ the request to an\n   AS, the AS has to go through a similar process of determining\
    \ the\n   session case and the served user.  Since it should come to the same\n\
    \   conclusion that this is a terminating session case, it also has to\n   look\
    \ at the Request-URI to determine the served user.\n   In the originating case,\
    \ it can be observed that while the\n   P-Asserted-Identity header field just\
    \ represents the originating user\n   when it enters the S-CSCF, it is overloaded\
    \ with another meaning when\n   it is sent to an AS over the ISC interface.  This\
    \ other meaning is\n   that it serves as a representation of the served user.\n\
    \   In the terminating case, a similar overloading happens to the\n   Request-URI;\
    \ while it first only represented the identity of the\n   intended terminating\
    \ user, it is overloaded with another meaning when\n   it is sent to an AS over\
    \ the ISC interface.  This other meaning is\n   that it serves as a representation\
    \ of the served user.\n   In basic call scenarios, this does not show up as a\
    \ problem, but once\n   more complicated service scenarios (notably forwarding\
    \ services) need\n   to be realized, it poses severe limitations.  Such scenarios\
    \ are\n   brought forward in the following subsections.\n"

  - "4.2.  Diversion: Continue on Terminating Leg, but Finish Subsequent\n      Terminating\
    \ iFC First\n   Imagine a service scenario where a user B has a terminating service\n\
    \   that diverts the call to a different destination but is required to\n   still\
    \ execute subsequent terminating services for the same user.\n   This means that\
    \ this particular user has multiple iFC configured that\n   are applicable for\
    \ an incoming initial request.  When the S-CSCF\n   receives an initial INVITE\
    \ request, it analyzes the request and\n   determines that the session case is\
    \ for a terminating registered\n   user, then it determines the served user to\
    \ be user B by looking at\n   the Request-URI.\n   Now the S-CSCF starts the iFC\
    \ processing.  The first iFC that matches\n   the INVITE request causes the INVITE\
    \ to be forwarded over the ISC\n   interface to an AS that hosts user B's diversion\
    \ service by adding\n   the AS and S-CSCF's own hostnames to the Route header.\
    \  The S-CSCF\n   adds an Original Dialog Identifier (ODI) to the S-CSCF's own\
    \ hostname\n   on the Route header.  This allows the S-CSCF to correlate an INVITE\n\
    \   coming from an AS over the ISC interface to the existing session that\n  \
    \ forwarded the INVITE to the AS in the first place.\n   When the AS receives\
    \ the initial INVITE request, it analyzes the\n   request and determines that\
    \ the session case is for a terminating\n   registered user, then it determines\
    \ the served user to be user B by\n   looking at the Request-URI.  Based on some\
    \ criteria, the diversion\n   service concludes that the request needs to be diverted\
    \ to another\n   user or application C.  It does this by changing the Request-URI\
    \ to\n   C.  Optionally, it records the Request-URI history by using the\n   History-\
    \ Info header field (RFC 4244 [7]).  Then the AS removes\n   itself from the Route\
    \ header and routes the INVITE request back to\n   the S-CSCF by using the topmost\
    \ Route header field.\n   When the S-CSCF receives the INVITE over the ISC interface,\
    \ it can\n   see that the Route header contains its own hostname and an ODI that\n\
    \   correlates to an existing terminating session for user B.  This can\n   be\
    \ used by the S-CSCF to analyze whether there are still unexecuted\n   iFC.  (Note\
    \ that the current behavior of the S-CSCF on receiving an\n   INVITE with a changed\
    \ Request-URI is to terminate the iFC processing\n   and to route the request\
    \ based on the new Request-URI value.)\n   The process repeats itself.  The INVITE\
    \ is forwarded to the AS that\n   is associated with this particular iFC.  When\
    \ the AS receives the\n   initial INVITE request, it analyzes the request and\
    \ determines that\n   the session case is for a terminating registered user, then\
    \ it\n   determines the served user to be user C by looking at the Request-\n\
    \   URI.  This is clearly wrong, as the user being served is still user\n   B.\n\
    \   This scenario clearly shows the problem that occurs when the Request-\n  \
    \ URI is overloaded with the meanings \"intended target identity\" and\n   \"\
    served user\" with the operation as described in Section 4.1.  And it\n   shows\
    \ that this use case can not be realized without introducing a\n   mechanism that\
    \ conveys information about the served user from the\n   S-CSCF to the AS.  Use\
    \ of the History-Info element does not solve\n   this problem as it does not tell\
    \ the AS which user is being served;\n   it just presents a history of diversions\
    \ that might not be even\n   caused by the systems serving this particular user.\
    \  A more detailed\n   analysis on why the History-Info header field can't be\
    \ used is\n   provided in Appendix A.\n"

    \   Processing\n   Imagine a service scenario where a user B has a terminating\
    \ service\n   that diverts the call to a different destination.  It is required\n\
    \   that a forwarded call leg is handled as an originating call leg and\n   that\
    \ originating services for user B are executed.  This means that\n   this particular\
    \ user has one or more iFC configured that are\n   applicable for an outgoing\

    \ (RFC 4244 [7]).  Then the AS removes itself\n   from the Route header.  To make\
    \ sure that the request is handled as a\n   new originating call on behalf of\
    \ user B, the AS adds the \"orig\"\n   parameter to the topmost route header.\
    \  Then it routes the INVITE\n   request back to the S-CSCF by using this topmost\
    \ Route header field.\n   When the S-CSCF receives the INVITE over the ISC interface,\
    \ it can\n   see that the topmost Route header contains its own hostname and an\n\
    \   \"orig\" parameter.  Because the topmost Route header contains the\n   \"\
    orig\" parameter, the S-CSCF concludes that the INVITE should be\n   handled as\
    \ if a call is originated by the served user.  The served\n   user is determined\
    \ from the P-Asserted-Identity header to be user A.\n    This is clearly wrong,\
    \ as the user being served is and should be\n   user B.\n   For the sake of discussion,\
    \ let's assume that the S-CSCF can\n   determine that the served user is user\
    \ B.  Then the procedure would\n   continue as follows: The S-CSCF starts the\
    \ originating iFC\n   processing, the first iFC that matches the INVITE request\
    \ causes the\n   INVITE to be forwarded over the ISC interface to an AS that hosts\
    \ an\n   originating service of user B by adding the AS and S-CSCF's own\n   hostnames\
    \ to the Route header.  The S-CSCF adds an Original Dialog\n   Identifier (ODI)\
    \ to the S-CSCF's own hostname on the Route header.\n   The INVITE is forwarded\
    \ to the AS that is associated with this\n   particular iFC.  When the AS receives\
    \ the initial INVITE request, it\n   analyzes the request and determines that\
    \ the session case is for an\n   originating registered user, then it determines\
    \ the served user to be\n   user A by looking at the P-Asserted-Identity.  This\
    \ is clearly wrong,\n   as the user being served is and should be user B.\n  \
    \ This scenario clearly shows the problem that occurs when the\n   P-Asserted-Identity\
    \ is overloaded with the meanings \"call originator\"\n   and \"served user\"\
    \ with the operation as described in Section 4.1.\n   And it shows that this use\
    \ case can not be realized without\n   introducing a mechanism that conveys information\
    \ about the served\n   user from the S-CSCF to the AS and from the AS to the S-CSCF.\
    \  Use of\n   the History-Info element does not solve this problem as it does\
    \ not\n   tell the AS which user is being served, but just presents a history\n\
    \   of diversions that might not be even caused by the systems serving\n   this\
    \ particular user.  A more detailed analysis on why the History-\n   Info header\
    \ field can't be used is provided in Appendix A.\n"

- title: 8.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "8.  Applicability\n   According to RFC 3427 [5], P-headers have a limited applicability.\n\
    \   Specifications of P-headers, such as this RFC, need to clearly\n   document\
    \ the useful scope of the proposal and explain its limitations\n   and why it\
    \ is not suitable for the general use of SIP on the\n   Internet.\n   The use\
    \ of the P-Served-User header field extensions is only\n   applicable inside a\
    \ Trust Domain for served user.  Nodes in such a\n   Trust Domain explicitly trust\
    \ each other to convey the served user\n   and to be responsible for withholding\
    \ that information outside of the\n   Trust Domain.  The means by which the network\
    \ determines the served\n   user and the policies that are executed for a specific\
    \ served user is\n   outside the scope of this document.\n   The served user information\
    \ lacks an indication of who or what\n   specifically determined the served user,\
    \ and so it must be assumed\n   that the Trust Domain determined the served user.\
    \  Therefore, the\n   information is only meaningful when securely received from\
    \ a node\n   known to be a member of the Trust Domain.\n   Because the served\
    \ user typically only has validity in one\n   administrative domain, it is in\
    \ general not suitable for inter-domain\n   use or use in the Internet at large.\n\
    \   Despite these limitations, there are sufficiently useful specialized\n   deployments\
    \ that meet the assumptions described above, and that can\n   accept the limitations\
    \ that result, to warrant informational\n   publication of this mechanism.  An\
    \ example deployment would be a\n   closed network like 3GPP IMS.\n"

  contents:
  - "9.  IANA Considerations\n   This document defines a new SIP header field: P-Served-User.\
    \  This\n   header field has been registered by the IANA in the SIP Parameters\n\
    \   registry under the Header Fields subregistry.\n"
- title: 10.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   The P-Served-User header field defined in this\
    \ document is to be used\n   in an environment where elements are trusted and\
    \ where attackers are\n   not supposed to have access to the protocol messages\
    \ between those\n   elements.  Traffic protection between network elements is\
    \ sometimes\n   achieved by using IPsec and sometimes by physically protecting\
    \ the\n   network.  In any case, the environment where the P-Served-User header\n\
    \   field will be used ensures the integrity and the confidentiality of\n   the\
    \ contents of this header field.\n   The Spec(T) that defines the Trust Domain\
    \ for P-Served-User MUST\n   require that member nodes understand the P-Served-User\
    \ header\n   extension.\n   There is a security risk if a P-Served-User header\
    \ field is allowed\n   to propagate out of the Trust Domain where it was generated.\
    \  In that\n   case, user-sensitive information would be revealed.  To prevent\
    \ such\n   a breach from happening, proxies MUST NOT insert the header when\n\
    \   forwarding requests to a hop that is located outside the Trust\n   Domain.\
    \  When forwarding the request to a node in the Trust Domain,\n   proxies MUST\
    \ NOT insert the header unless they have sufficient\n   knowledge that the route\
    \ set includes another proxy in the Trust\n   Domain that understands the header,\
    \ such as the home proxy.  There is\n   no automatic mechanism to learn the support\
    \ for this specification.\n   Proxies MUST remove the header when forwarding requests\
    \ to nodes that\n   are not in the Trust Domain or when the proxy does not have\
    \ knowledge\n   of any other proxy included in the route set that will remove\
    \ it\n   before it is routed to any node that is not in the Trust Domain.\n"

    \         Served User Information on the ISC Interface\n"
- title: A.1.  Semantics
  contents:
  - "A.1.  Semantics\n   The History-Info (as specified in RFC 4244 [7]) holds a record\
    \ of\n   subsequent Request-URI values that are put on an initial request\n  \
    \ during its processing in the network.\n   If it would be possible at all to\
    \ use the History-Info header for the\n   purpose of communicating the served\
    \ user, then again the same\n   overloading would occur as the one that we are\
    \ trying to get rid of\n   (Section 4.2).  In this case, we overload the particular\
    \ History-Info\n   header field's hi-entry with the meaning \"historic target\
    \ identity\"\n   and \"served user\".\n   Another reason that the History-Info\
    \ header can not solve the\n   requirements as expressed in this document is that,\
    \ in originating\n   session case scenarios, the served user is currently determined\
    \ from\n   the P-Asserted-Identity, as that header field contains the asserted\n\
    \   originating user's identity.  The History-Info header, being a record\n  \
    \ of Request-URIs, can never be a solution for this case.\n   Looking at the call-out-of-the-blue\
    \ scenario (Section 4.4), it is\n   impossible to construct a History-Info header\
    \ for an INVITE request\n   on behalf of user C that appears to come from user\
    \ B and targets user\n   D that would express the served user C without violating\
    \ the original\n   semantics of the History-Info header according to (RFC 4244\
    \ [7]).\n"
- title: A.2.  Additional Observations
  contents:
  - "A.2.  Additional Observations\n   The purpose of the History-Info header is a\
    \ header that has an end-\n   to-end application.  For the purpose of informing\
    \ an AS on the ISC\n   interface, this is overkill.\n   At the moment that the\
    \ AS receives an initial INVITE over the ISC\n   interface, this INVITE may have\
    \ passed a vast number of proxies that\n   may or may not have added history information.\
    \  On top of that, the\n   request may have traversed several AS instances for\
    \ the same served\n   user.  In case several subsequent iFC are active, all these\
    \ AS\n   instances may perform a forwarding.  This means that it is not\n   possible\
    \ to define an algorithm that points out which hi-entry of a\n   History-Info\
    \ header should represent the served user.  In other\n   words, a History-Info\
    \ header field with n entries expresses a branch\n   of depth n.  Any or none\
    \ of these elements could be the served user\n   identity.\n   The History-Info\
    \ header does not comply with the second requirement\n   as expressed in Section\
    \ 5, as it does not have a means to express the\n   session case in a natural\
    \ way.\n"
- title: A.3.  Conclusion
  contents:
  - "A.3.  Conclusion\n   Each observation in the previous subsections, alone, is\
    \ enough to\n   disregard the History-Info header as an information element that\
    \ is\n   suitable for transporting the served user information over the ISC\n\
    \   interface.\n   Note that this does not prohibit the use of the P-Served-User\
    \ header\n   and the History-Info header in the same request.  In fact that will\n\
    \   be a quite likely scenario for network-based diversion services like,\n  \
    \ for example, the Communication Diversion service as specified in\n   (3GPP TS\
    \ 24.173 [10]).\n"
