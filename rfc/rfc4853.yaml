    of the SignedData protected content type when more than one\n   digital signature
    is present.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document updates the Cryptographic Message Syntax [CMS].
    \ The\n   CMS SignedData protected content type allows multiple digital\n   signatures,
    but the specification is unclear about the appropriate\n   processing by a recipient
    of such a signed content.  This document\n   provides replacement text for a few
    paragraphs, making it clear that\n   the protected content is validly signed by
    a given signer, if any of\n   the digital signatures from that signer are valid.\n
    \  This property is especially important in two cases.  First, when the\n   recipients
    do not all implement the same digital signature algorithm,\n   a signer can sign
    the content with several different digital\n   signature algorithms so that each
    of the recipients can find an\n   acceptable signature.  For example, if some
    recipients support RSA\n   and some recipients support ECDSA, then the signer
    can generate two\n   signatures, one with RSA and one with ECDSA, so that each
    recipient\n   will be able to validate one of the signatures.  Second, when a\n
    \  community is transitioning one-way hash functions or digital\n   signature
    algorithms, a signer can sign the content with the older\n   and the newer signature
    algorithms so that each recipient can find an\n   acceptable signature, regardless
    of their state in the transition.\n   For example, consider a transition from
    RSA with SHA-1 to RSA with\n   SHA-256.  The signer can generate two signatures,
    one with SHA-1 and\n   one with SHA-256, so that each recipient will be able to
    validate at\n   least one of the RSA signatures.\n"

  - '|  application that employs a rule other than one valid signature for

    '
  - '|  each signer must specify those rules.  Also, where simple matching of

    '
  - '|  the signer identifier is not sufficient to determine whether the

    '
  - '|  signatures were generated by the same signer, the application

    '
  - '|  specification must describe how to determine which signatures were

    '
  - '|  generated by the same signer.  Support of different communities of

    '
  - '|  recipients is the primary reason that signers choose to include more

    '
  - '|  than one signature.  For example, the signed-data content type might

    '

    '
  - '|  with the ECDSA signature algorithm.  This allows recipients to

    '
  - '|  verify the signature associated with one algorithm or the other.
