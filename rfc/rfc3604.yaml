  - "1.  Overview\n   This document details the changes to GSMP necessary for the\
    \ support\n   of optical (non-transparent and all optical), SONET/SDH, and spatial\n\
    \   switching of IP packets, Layer 2 (L2) frames and TDM data.  When\n   implemented,\
    \ GSMP controllers will then be able to control: photonic\n   cross-connects (optical-optical),\
    \ transparent optical cross connects\n   (optical-electrical-optical, frame independent),\
    \ opaque cross\n   connects (optical-electrical-optical, SONET/SDH frames), and\n\
    \   traditional TDM switches (all electrical).  The resulting systems\n   could\
    \ form IP based optical routers, optical label switches,\n   wavelength routers,\
    \ and dynamic optical cross connects.\n   Several different generic models exist\
    \ defining how to provide\n   control plane functionality in an optical network\
    \ [2], [3], [4].\n   This document takes no position on which model is most appropriate\n\
    \   (e.g., single or multiple routing plane instances).  The only\n   assumption\
    \ is that the ability to separate the control mechanisms\n   from the data switching\
    \ is as useful for the signaling of optical\n   paths (e.g., GMPLS) as it is for\
    \ the signaling of L2 paths (e.g.,\n   MPLS).  Therefore, the requirements contained\
    \ within are focused only\n   on the separation of control functions from data\
    \ functions in order\n   to provide a more flexible network architecture.\n  \
    \ GSMPv3 [5] is well suited for providing the control interface\n   necessary\
    \ for allowing an IP based controller to direct the\n   activities of an optical\
    \ switch.  In order for GSMP to operate\n   between controllers and optical switches\
    \ and cross connects, support\n   for optical labels and service and resource\
    \ abstractions must be\n   added to GSMP.\n   This document also includes changes\
    \ recommended by implementers that\n   will facilitate easier development of a\
    \ GSMP implementation.  These\n   changes consist of rearranging PDU formats,\
    \ clarification of flags,\n   transaction identifiers, and response codes.\n"

    \ [2], [3] has had very similar requirements for label formats,\n   alignment\
    \ with GMPLS is proposed.  This includes support for:\n        - Digital Carrier\
    \ Hierarchy (e.g., DS-1, E1)\n        - SONET and SDH Hierarchy (e.g., OC-3, STM-1,\

    \ The point where a transport layer signal is inserted into a lower\n   layer\

- title: 2.7.1.  Serial Transactions
  contents:
  - "2.7.1.  Serial Transactions\n   Many existing OXCs use a command interface which\
    \ assumes a serial\n   transaction model.  That is, a new command cannot be issued\
    \ or\n   processed until the existing command is completed.  Under\n   provisioning\
    \ control via a network management application, and with\n   non-dynamic path\
    \ setup, this model has been adequate.\n   Moving to a dynamic path setup capability\
    \ with a distributed control\n   plane, a parallel transaction model is likely\
    \ required for\n   performance.  This is particularly helpful when the performance\
    \ of\n   setting up a TDM style connection is much slower than setting up an\n\
    \   L2 connection table.  If the OXC is not able to support a parallel\n   transaction\
    \ model, a GSMP controller MUST be informed of this and\n   adopt serial transaction\
    \ behavior.\n"
- title: 2.7.2.  Bulk Transactions

    \ setup TDM connections\n   relative to L2 fabrics (e.g., VC-4/STS-1 SPE fabric\
    \ in an HOVC/STS\n   switch), support for sending multiple transactions in the\
    \ same\n   message is a useful optimization.  When an OXC receives a bulk\n  \
    \ message, the individual transactions are acted upon and a single\n   reply is\
    \ sent.  If parallel transactions are not supported, bulk\n   messages can improve\
    \ performance by reducing transaction overhead.\n   Bulk transactions SHOULD be\
    \ supported.\n"
- title: 2.8.  OXC Protection Capabilities
  contents:
  - "2.8.  OXC Protection Capabilities\n   To achieve good link protection performance\
    \ (e.g., 50 ms after\n   failure detection), SONET/SDH and some OXC systems use\
    \ hardware based\n   protection schemes (e.g., ring protection).  Achieving this\
    \ level of\n   performance solely using a data control plane such as GMPLS is\
    \ a\n   serious challenge.  An alternate approach is to utilize protection\n \
    \  capabilities of an OXC with a dynamic control plane.  An implication\n   of\
    \ this hybrid approach is that extensions are needed to GSMP to\n   provision\
    \ the behavior of an OXC in anticipation of a link failure.\n   This differs from\
    \ the strict master-slave relationship in GSMP for\n   Layer 2 switches in that\
    \ here the OXC is capable of taking an action\n   independent of the GSMP controller\
    \ and then informing the controller\n   afterwards.  Consequently, the GSMP port\
    \ configuration command MUST\n   be extended to allow autonomous protection behaviors\
    \ to be\n   provisioned into the Network Element.\n   Furthermore, the controller\
    \ MUST be able to provide the parameters\n   for when reversion from a backup\
    \ link to the original link is\n   allowed.  This may take the form of hold-off\
    \ timers, BER parameters,\n   or the requirement for controller directed reversion.\n"
- title: 2.8.1.  Non-Reserved Protection Links
  contents:
  - "2.8.1.  Non-Reserved Protection Links\n   An example of protection OXC behavior\
    \ is that when a link fails, a\n   backup link may be used to protect traffic\
    \ on.  This backup link\n   could be selected from a set of links, none of which\
    \ are pre-\n   reserved.  A backup link could be shared with one or more \"working\"\
    \n   links which is a form of 1:n shared protection.  Specifying the set\n   of\
    \ possible backup links SHOULD be done as an option to the Add-\n   Branch message.\n\
    \   When a backup link is used or the OXC reverts back to the original\n   link,\
    \ the control plane (i.e., signaling) may need to know about the\n   new path\
    \ state in order to notify the operator, or take some other\n   OAM action (e.g.,\
    \ billing, SLA monitoring).  An additional GSMP\n   message to inform the controller\

- title: 2.8.2.  Dedicated Protection Links
  contents:
  - "2.8.2.  Dedicated Protection Links\n   A more specialized form of restoration\
    \ called \"1+1\" defines a\n   (usually node disjoint) protection path in a transport/optical\n\
    \   network for a given working path.  At the ingress node to the path,\n   the\
    \ traffic signal is sent simultaneously along both working and\n   protection\
    \ paths.  Under non-failure conditions at the egress node,\n   only the last link\
    \ of the working path is connected to the client.\n   When any link in the working\
    \ path fails, traffic on the working path\n   ceases to be received at end of\
    \ the path.  The egress OXC detects\n   this condition and then switches to use\
    \ the last link of the\n   protection path without the controller having to issue\
    \ a Move-Input-\n   Branch message.  At no time is the ingress node aware which\
    \ link the\n   egress node is using.  Selection of the protection path and all\
    \ of\n   its links is outside the scope of GSMP.\n   Specification of the two\
    \ output branches at the ingress node can be\n   done with the usual Add-Branch\

    \ should be\n   done when the Add-Branch message is sent.  This SHOULD be an option\n\
    \   to that message.  The egress node protection link is not shared with\n   any\
    \ other working link.\n   When a protection link is used or the OXC reverts back\
    \ to the working\n   link, the control plane (i.e., signaling) may need to know\
    \ about the\n   new path state in order to notify the operator, or take some other\n\
    \   OAM action (e.g., billing, SLA monitoring).  An additional GSMP\n   message\
    \ to inform the controller SHOULD be added to do this.\n   If an alternate input\
    \ port is not specified with an original Add-\n   Branch message, it MAY be specified\
    \ in a subsequent Add-Branch\n   message.  In this case, it is useful to include\
    \ information about\n   existing users of the output port in that Add-Branch message.\
    \  This\n   helps the OXC immediately learn of the association between the new\n\
    \   input port and an existing one.  The association is used to enable\n   OXC\
    \ protection procedures.  This capability MUST be added to the add-\n   branch\
    \ message.\n   Similar contextual information is needed for a Delete-Branch message\n\
    \   so that the OXC can determine if a path becomes unprotected.  This\n   capability\

    \ request.\n   If multiple controllers are connected to a single switch and the\n\
    \   switch sends an event message with \"ReturnReceipt\" set to all of\n   them,\
    \ there is no way for the switch to identify which controller the\n   receipt\
    \ is coming from.\n   The \"ReturnReceipt\" value should not be permitted for\
    \ Events.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Window Size
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Window Size\n   The Switch Configuration Message defined in chapter 8.1\
    \ in [5]\n   defines a Window size to be used by the controller when sending\n\
    \   messages to the switch.  It is not stated if this window should apply\n  \
    \ to all messages or only to messages that will always generate a\n   reply.\n\
    \   If messages that may not generate a reply should be counted against\n   the\
    \ window a time-out period when they are to be removed from the\n   window should\
    \ be defined.\n   It is not defined if the window should be cleared when the adjacency\n\
    \   is lost and later recovered.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Retransmission
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Retransmission\n   A retransmission policy with a well-designed exponential\
    \ backoff\n   should be used if no reply is received for a message with \"AckAll\"\
    \n   set.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Delete Branches Message
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Delete Branches Message\n   The \"Delete Branch Element\" has a 4 bit Error\
    \ field that should be\n   redefined to match the size of the \"Failure Response\
    \ Codes\".\n"
- title: 3.5.  Adjacency
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Adjacency\n   The chapter about how to handle a new adjacency and re-established\n\
    \   adjacencies should be clarified.\n"
- title: 3.5.1.  Loss of Synchronization
  contents:
  - "3.5.1.  Loss of Synchronization\n   The switch must not reset the connection\
    \ states if another adjacency\n   has already been established since this would\
    \ destroy an already\n   valid state.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The security of GSMP's TCP/IP control channel\
    \ has been addressed in\n   [15].  Any potential remaining security considerations\
    \ are not\n   addressed in this requirements document.\n"
