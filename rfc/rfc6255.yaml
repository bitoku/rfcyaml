  - "1.  Introduction\n   The DTNRG research group has defined many protocols relevant\
    \ to the\n   DTN architecture [RFC4838] such as the Bundle Protocol [RFC5050]\
    \ and\n   Licklider Transmission Protocol [RFC5326].  The specifications of\n\
    \   these protocols contain fields that are subject to a registry.  For\n   the\
    \ purpose of its research work, the group created ad hoc registries\n   (http://www.dtnrg.org/wiki/AssignedNamesAndNumbers).\
    \  As the\n   specifications are stable and have multiple interoperable\n   implementations,\
    \ the group would like to hand off the registries to\n   IANA for official custody.\
    \  This document describes the actions\n   executed by IANA.\n"
- title: 2.  Treatment of Flag Fields Encoded Using SDNVs
  contents:
  - "2.  Treatment of Flag Fields Encoded Using SDNVs\n   The DTN protocols use several\
    \ extensible bit flag fields that are\n   encoded as Self-Delimiting Numeric Values\
    \ (SDNVs) as defined in\n   Section 4.1 of [RFC5050].  For these fields, the registry\
    \ specifies\n   the allocation and usage of bit positions within the unencoded\
    \ field.\n   The SDNV encoding treats the ensemble of bits in the unencoded value\n\
    \   as a numeric value to be encoded on transmission and decoded on\n   reception\
    \ as described in [RFC5050].\n   Processing of SDNV-encoded flags is discussed\
    \ in [RFC6256].\n   Section 4.1 of [RFC5050] specifies that implementations are\
    \ not\n   required to handle SDNVs with more than 64 bits in their unencoded\n\
    \   value.  Accordingly, SDNV-encoded flag fields should be limited to 64\n  \
    \ bit positions.\n   IANA registry policies and wording used in this document\
    \ are\n   described in [RFC5226].\n"
