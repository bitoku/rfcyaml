- title: 1.1.  What is GSM?
  contents:
  - "1.1.  What is GSM?\n   GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) is a digital\
    \ mobile\n   phone standard that is used extensively in many parts of the world.\n\
    \   First named after its frequency band around 900 MHz, GSM-900 has\n   provided\
    \ the basis for several other networks utilizing GSM\n   technology, in particular,\
    \ GSM networks operating in the frequency\n   bands around 1800 MHz and 1900 MHz.\
    \  When referring to \"GSM\" in this\n   document, we mean any of these GSM-based\
    \ networks that operate a\n   short message service.\n"
- title: 1.2.  What is SMS?
  contents:
  - "1.2.  What is SMS?\n   The Short Message Service (SMS) [SMS] is an integral part\
    \ of the GSM\n   network technology.  It has been very successful and currently\
    \ is a\n   major source of revenue for many GSM operators.  SMS as a service is\n\
    \   so successful that other Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN)\n   technologies\
    \ have adopted it as well, in particular, the Integrated\n   Services Digital\
    \ Network (ISDN).  Because of this development, this\n   memo uses the term \"\
    SMS client\" to refer to user agents that are able\n   to send and/or receive\
    \ SMS messages.\n"
- title: 1.2.1.  SMS Content
  contents:
  - "1.2.1.  SMS Content\n   GSM SMS messages are alphanumeric paging messages that\
    \ can be sent to\n   and from SMS clients.  SMS messages have a maximum length\
    \ of 160\n   characters (7-bit characters from the GSM character set [SMS-CHAR]),\n\
    \   or 140 octets.  Other character sets (such as UCS-2 16-bit\n   characters,\
    \ resulting in 70-character messages) MAY also be supported\n   [SMS-CHAR], but\
    \ are defined as being optional by the SMS\n   specification.  Consequently, applications\
    \ handling SMS messages as\n   part of a chain of character-processing applications\
    \ MUST make sure\n   that character sets are correctly mapped to and from the\
    \ character\n   set used for SMS messages.\n   While the 160-character content\
    \ type for SMS messages is by far the\n   one most widely used, there are numerous\
    \ other content types for SMS\n   messages, such as small bitmaps (\"operator\
    \ logos\") and simple formats\n   for musical notes (\"ring tones\").  However,\
    \ these formats are\n   proprietary and are not considered in this memo.\n   SMS\
    \ messages are limited in length (140 octets), and the first\n   versions of the\
    \ SMS specification did not specify any standardized\n   methods for concatenating\
    \ SMS messages.  As a consequence, several\n   proprietary methods were invented,\
    \ but the current SMS specification\n   does specify message concatenation.  In\
    \ order to deal with this\n   situation, SMS clients composing messages SHOULD\
    \ use the standard\n   concatenation method based on the header in the TP-User\
    \ Data field as\n   specified in the SMS specification [SMS].  When sending a\
    \ message to\n   an SMS recipient whose support for concatenated messages is unknown,\n\
    \   the SMS client MAY opt to use the backwards-compatible (text-based)\n   concatenation\
    \ method defined in the SMS specification [SMS].\n   Proprietary concatenation\
    \ methods SHOULD NOT be used except in closed\n   systems, where the capabilities\
    \ of the recipient(s) are always known.\n"
- title: 1.2.2.  SMS Infrastructure
  contents:
  - "1.2.2.  SMS Infrastructure\n   SMS messages can be transmitted over an SMS client's\
    \ network\n   interface using the signaling channels of the underlying GSTN\n\
    \   infrastructure, so there is no delay for call setup.  Alternatively,\n   SMS\
    \ messages may be submitted through other front-ends (for example,\n   Web-based\
    \ services), which makes it possible for SMS clients to run\n   on computers that\
    \ are not directly connected to a GSTN network\n   supporting SMS.\n   SMS messages\
    \ sent with the GSTN SMS service MUST be sent as class 1\n   SMS messages, if\
    \ the client is able to specify the message class.\n"
- title: 1.2.2.1.  SMS Centers
  contents:
  - "1.2.2.1.  SMS Centers\n   For delivery within GSTN networks, SMS messages are\
    \ stored by an\n   entity called SMS Center (SMSC) and sent to the recipient when\
    \ the\n   subscriber connects to the network.  The number of a cooperative SMSC\n\
    \   must be known to the SMS sender (i.e., the entity submitting the SMS\n   message\
    \ to a GSTN infrastructure) when sending the message (usually\n   the SMSC's number\
    \ is configured in the SMS client and specific for\n   the network operator to\
    \ which the sender has subscribed).  In most\n   situations, the SMSC number is\
    \ part of the sending SMS client's\n   configuration.  However, in some special\
    \ cases (such as when the SMS\n   recipient only accepts messages from a certain\
    \ SMSC), it may be\n   necessary to send the SMS message over a specific SMSC.\
    \  The scheme\n   specified in this memo does not support the specification of\
    \ SMSC\n   numbers, so in case of scenarios where messages have to be sent\n \
    \  through a certain SMSC, there must be some other context establishing\n   this\
    \ requirement or message delivery may fail.\n"
- title: 1.2.3.  Uniform Resource Identifiers
  contents:
  - "1.2.3.  Uniform Resource Identifiers\n   One of the core specifications for identifying\
    \ resources on the\n   Internet is [RFC3986], specifying the syntax and semantics\
    \ of a\n   Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).  The most important notion of URIs\n\
    \   are \"schemes\", which define a framework within which resources can be\n\
    \   uniquely identified and addressed.  URIs enable users to access\n   resources\
    \ and are used for very diverse schemes, such as access\n   protocols (HTTP, FTP),\
    \ broadcast media (TV channels [RFC2838]),\n   messaging (email [RFC2368]), and\
    \ even telephone numbers (voice\n   [RFC3966]).\n   URIs often are mentioned together\
    \ with Uniform Resource Names (URNs)\n   and/or Uniform Resource Locators (URLs),\
    \ and it often is unclear how\n   to separate these concepts.  For the purpose\
    \ of this memo, only the\n   term URI will be used, referring to the most fundamental\
    \ concept.\n   The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has issued a note\n   [uri-clarification]\
    \ discussing the topic of URIs, URNs, and URLs in\n   detail.\n"
- title: 1.2.4.  SMS Messages and the Internet
  contents:
  - "1.2.4.  SMS Messages and the Internet\n   One of the important reasons for the\
    \ universal access of the Web is\n   the ability to access all information through\
    \ a unique interface.\n   This kind of integration makes it easy to provide information\
    \ as well\n   as to consume it.  One aspect of this integration is the support\
    \ of\n   user agents (in the case of the Web, commonly referred to as\n   browsers)\
    \ for multiple content formats (such as HTML, GIF, JPEG) and\n   access schemes\
    \ (such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP).\n   The \"mailto\" scheme has proven to be very\
    \ useful and popular because\n   most user agents support it by providing an email\
    \ composition\n   facility when the user selects (e.g., clicks on) the URI.  Similarly,\n\
    \   the \"sms\" scheme can be supported by user agents by providing an SMS\n \
    \  message composition facility when the user selects the URI.  In cases\n   where\
    \ the user agent does not provide a built-in SMS message\n   composition facility,\
    \ the scheme could still be supported by opening\n   a Web page that provides\
    \ such a service.  The specific Web page to be\n   used could be configured by\
    \ the user, so that each user could use the\n   SMS message composition service\
    \ of his choice.\n   The goal of this memo is to specify the \"sms\" URI scheme\
    \ so that user\n   agents (such as Web browsers and email clients) can start to\
    \ support\n   it.  The \"sms\" URI scheme identifies SMS message endpoints as\n\
    \   resources.  When \"sms\" URIs are dereferenced, implementations MAY\n   create\
    \ a message and present it to be edited before being sent, or\n   they MAY invoke\
    \ additional services to provide the functionality\n   necessary for composing\
    \ a message and sending it to the SMS message\n   endpoint.  In either case, simply\
    \ activating a link with an \"sms\" URI\n   SHOULD NOT cause a message to be sent\
    \ without prior user\n   confirmation.\n"
- title: 1.2.4.1.  SMS Messages and the Web
  contents:
  - "1.2.4.1.  SMS Messages and the Web\n   SMS messages can provide an alternative\
    \ to \"mailto\" URIs [RFC2368],\n   or \"tel\" or \"fax\" URIs [RFC3966].  When\
    \ an \"sms\" URI is activated,\n   the user agent MAY start a program for sending\
    \ an SMS message, just\n   as \"mailto\" may open a mail client.  Unfortunately,\
    \ most browsers do\n   not support the external handling of internally unsupported\
    \ URI\n   schemes in the same generalized way as most of them support external\n\
    \   handling of content for media types that they do not support\n   internally.\
    \  Ideally, user agents should implement generic URI\n   parsers and provide a\
    \ way to associate unsupported schemes with\n   external applications (or Web-based\
    \ services).\n   The recipient of an SMS message need not be a mobile phone. \
    \ It can\n   be a server that can process SMS messages, either by gatewaying them\n\
    \   to another messaging system (such as regular electronic mail), or by\n   parsing\
    \ them for supplementary services.\n   SMS messages can be used to transport almost\
    \ any kind of data (even\n   though there is a very tight size limit), but the\
    \ only standardized\n   data formats are character-based messages in different\
    \ character\n   encodings.  SMS messages have a maximum length of 160 characters\n\
    \   (when using 7-bit characters from the SMS character set), or 140\n   octets.\
    \  However, SMS messages can be concatenated to form longer\n   messages.  It\
    \ is up to the user agent to decide whether to limit the\n   length of the message,\
    \ and how to indicate this limit in its user\n   interface if necessary.  There\
    \ is one exception to this; see\n   Section 2.6.\n"
- title: 1.2.4.2.  SMS Messages and Forms
  contents:
  - "1.2.4.2.  SMS Messages and Forms\n   The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) [HTML401]\
    \ provides a way to\n   collect information from a user and pass it to a server\
    \ for\n   processing.  This functionality is known as \"HTML forms\".  A\n   filled-in\
    \ form is usually sent to the destination using the Hypertext\n   Transfer Protocol\
    \ (HTTP) or email.  However, SMS messages can also be\n   used as the transport\
    \ mechanism for these forms.  Depending on the\n   network configuration, the\
    \ sender's telephone number may be included\n   in the SMS message, thus providing\
    \ a weak form of authentication.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Applicability\n   This URI scheme provides information that can be used\
    \ for sending SMS\n   message(s) to specified recipient(s).  The functionality\
    \ is\n   comparable to that of the \"mailto\" URI, which (as per [RFC2368]) can\n\
    \   also be used with a comma-separated list of email addresses.\n   The notation\
    \ for phone numbers is taken from [RFC3966] and its\n   Erratum 203 [Err203].\
    \  Appendix A provides a corrected syntax of the\n   telephone number.  Refer\
    \ to that document for information on why this\n   particular format was chosen.\n\
    \   How SMS messages are sent to the SMSC or other intermediaries is\n   outside\
    \ the scope of this specification.  SMS messages can be sent\n   over the GSM\
    \ air interface by using a modem and a suitable protocol\n   or by accessing services\
    \ over other protocols, such as a Web-based\n   service for sending SMS messages.\
    \  Also, SMS message service options\n   like deferred delivery and delivery notification\
    \ requests are not\n   within the scope of this document.  Such services MAY be\
    \ requested\n   from the network by the user agent if necessary.\n   SMS messages\

    \ is taken from\n   Section 5.1 of [RFC3966].  Please consider Erratum 203 [Err203]\
    \ in\n   that specification.  For the reader's convenience, Appendix A\n   contains\
    \ a fixed syntax of the telephone number URI scheme, including\n   Erratum 203,\
    \ but RFC 3966 (plus all applicable errata) is the\n   normative reference.  The\
    \ description of phone numbers in RFC 3966\n   (Section 5.1) states: \"The 'telephone-subscriber'\
    \ part of the URI\n   indicates the number.  The phone number can be represented\
    \ in either\n   global (E.164) or local notation.  All phone numbers MUST use\
    \ the\n   global form unless they cannot be represented as such.  Numbers from\n\
    \   private numbering plans, emergency (\"911\", \"112\"), and some\n   directory-assistance\
    \ numbers (e.g., \"411\") and other \"service codes\"\n   (numbers of the form\
    \ N11 in the United States) cannot be represented\n   in global (E.164) form and\
    \ need to be represented as a local number\n   with a context.  Local numbers\
    \ MUST be tagged with a 'phone-\n   context'.\"\n   This specification defines\
    \ a single <sms-field>: \"body\".  Extensions\n   to this specification MAY define\
    \ additional fields.  Extensions MUST\n   NOT change the semantics of the specifications\
    \ they are extending.\n   Unknown fields encountered in \"sms\" URIs MUST be ignored\
    \ by\n   implementations.\n   The \"body\" <sms-field> is used to define the body\
    \ of the SMS message\n   to be composed.  It MUST not appear more than once in\
    \ an \"sms\" URI.\n   It consists of percent-encoded UTF-8 characters.  Implementations\n\
    \   MUST make sure that the \"body\" <sms-field> characters are converted\n  \
    \ to a suitable character encoding before sending, the most popular\n   being\
    \ the 7-bit SMS character encoding, another variant (though not\n   as universally\
    \ supported as 7-bit SMS) is the UCS-2 character\n   encoding (both specified\
    \ in [SMS-CHAR]).  Implementations MAY choose\n   to discard (or convert) characters\
    \ in the <sms-body> that are not\n   supported by the SMS character set they are\
    \ using to send the SMS\n   message.  If they do discard or convert characters,\
    \ they MUST notify\n   the user.\n   The syntax definition for <escaped-value>\
    \ refers to the text of an\n   SMS where all <reserved> (as per [RFC3986]) characters\

    \   definitions of <unreserved> and <pct-encoded> and for details about\n   percent-encoding.\n\
    \   User agents SHOULD support multiple recipients and SHOULD make it\n   clear\
    \ to users what the entire list of recipients is before\n   committing the user\
    \ to sending all the messages.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Processing an "sms" URI
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Processing an \"sms\" URI\n   The following list describes the steps for\
    \ processing an \"sms\" URI:\n   1.  The phone number of the first <sms-recipient>\
    \ is extracted.  It\n       is the phone number of the final recipient and it\
    \ MUST be written\n       in international form with country code, unless the\
    \ number only\n       works from inside a certain geographical area or a network.\
    \  Note\n       that some numbers may work from several networks but not from\
    \ the\n       whole world -- these SHOULD be written in international form.\n\
    \       According to [RFC3966], all international numbers MUST begin with\n  \
    \     a \"+\" character.  Hyphens, dots, and parentheses (referred to as\n   \
    \    \"visual separators\" in RFC 3966) are used only to improve\n       readability\
    \ and MUST NOT convey any other meaning.\n   2.  The \"body\" <sms-field> is extracted,\
    \ if present.\n   3.  The user agent SHOULD provide some means for message composition,\n\
    \       either by implementing this itself or by accessing a service that\n  \
    \     provides it.  Message composition SHOULD start with the body\n       extracted\
    \ from the \"body\" <sms-field>, if present.\n   4.  After message composition,\
    \ a user agent SHOULD try to send the\n       message first using the default\
    \ delivery method employed by that\n       user agent.  If that fails, the user\
    \ agent MAY try another\n       delivery method.\n   5.  If the URI contains a\
    \ comma-separated list of recipients (i.e.,\n       it contains multiple <sms-recipient>\
    \ parts), all of them are\n       processed in this manner.  Exactly the same\
    \ message SHOULD be\n       sent to all of the listed recipients, which means\
    \ that the\n       message resulting from the message composition step for the\
    \ first\n       recipient is used unaltered for all other recipients as well.\n"

    \ i.e.,\n      start with a \"+\".\n   o  The <global-number-digits> and the <local-number-digits>\
    \ must be\n      equal, after removing all visual separators.\n   o  For mandatory\
    \ additional parameters and the <phone-context> and\n      <extension> parameters\
    \ defined in [RFC3966], the <phone-context>\n      parameter value is compared\
    \ either as a host name if it is a\n      <domainname> or digit-by-digit if it\
    \ is <global-number-digits>.\n      The latter is compared after removing all\
    \ <visual-separator>\n      characters.\n   o  Parameters are compared according\
    \ to <pname>, regardless of the\n      order they appeared in the URI.  If one\
    \ URI has a parameter name\n      not found in the other, the two URIs are not\
    \ equal.\n   o  URI comparisons are case-insensitive.\n   Since \"sms\" URIs can\
    \ contain multiple <telephone-subscriber>s as well\n   as <sms-fields>, in addition\
    \ to adopting the rules defined for\n   comparing <telephone-subscriber>s as defined\
    \ by [RFC3966], two \"sms\"\n   URIs are only equivalent if their <sms-fields>\
    \ are identical, and if\n   all <telephone-subscriber>s, compared pairwise as\
    \ a set (i.e.,\n   without taking sequence into consideration), are equivalent.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.6.  Using \"sms\" URIs in HTML Forms\n   When using an \"sms\" type URI as\
    \ an action URI for HTML form\n   submission [HTML401], the form contents MUST\
    \ be packaged in the SMS\n   message just as they are packaged when using a \"\
    mailto\" URI\n   [RFC2368], using the \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" media\
    \ type\n   (as defined by HTML [HTML401]), effectively packaging all form data\n\
    \   into URI-compliant syntax [RFC3986].  The SMS message MUST NOT\n   contain\
    \ any HTTP header fields, only the form data.  The media type\n   is implicit.\
    \  It MUST NOT be transferred in the SMS message.  Since\n   the SMS message contains\
    \ the form field values, the body <sms-field>\n   of an \"sms\" type URI used\
    \ for an HTML form will be ignored.\n   The character encoding used for form submissions\
    \ MUST be UTF-8\n   [RFC3629].  It should be noted, however, that user agents\
    \ MUST\n   percent-encode form submissions before sending them (this encoding\
    \ is\n   specified by the URI syntax [RFC3986]).\n   The user agent SHOULD inform\
    \ the user about the possible security\n   hazards involved when submitting the\
    \ form (it is probably being sent\n   as plain text over an air interface).\n\
    \   If the form submission is longer than the maximum SMS message size,\n   the\
    \ user agent MAY either concatenate SMS messages, if it is able to\n   do so,\
    \ or it MAY refuse to send the message.  The user agent MUST NOT\n   send out\
    \ partial form submissions.\n"

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   SMS messages are transported without any provisions\
    \ for privacy or\n   integrity, so SMS users should be aware of these inherent\
    \ security\n   problems of SMS messages.  Unlike electronic mail, where additional\n\
    \   mechanisms exist to layer security features on top of the basic\n   infrastructure,\
    \ there currently is no such framework for SMS\n   messages.\n   SMS messages\
    \ very often are delivered almost instantaneously (if the\n   receiving SMS client\
    \ is online), but there is no guarantee for when\n   SMS messages will be delivered.\
    \  In particular, SMS messages between\n   different network operators sometimes\
    \ take a long time to be\n   delivered (hours or even days) or are not delivered\
    \ at all, so\n   applications SHOULD NOT make any assumptions about the reliability\n\
    \   and performance of SMS message transmission.\n   In most networks, sending\
    \ SMS messages is not a free service.\n   Therefore, SMS clients MUST make sure\
    \ that any action that incurs\n   costs is acknowledged by the end user, unless\
    \ explicitly instructed\n   otherwise by the end user.  If an SMS client has different\
    \ ways of\n   submitting an SMS message (such as a Web service and a phone line),\n\
    \   then the end user MUST have a way to control which way is chosen.\n   SMS\
    \ clients often are limited devices (typically mobile phones), and\n   the sending\
    \ SMS client SHOULD NOT make any assumptions about the\n   receiving SMS client\
    \ supporting any non-standard services, such as\n   proprietary message concatenation\
    \ or proprietary content types.\n   However, if the sending SMS client has prior\
    \ knowledge about the\n   receiving SMS client, then he MAY use this knowledge\
    \ to compose non-\n   standard SMS messages.\n   There are certain special SMS\
    \ messages defined in the SMS\n   specification [SMS] that can be used, for example,\
    \ to turn on\n   indicators on the phone display or to send data to certain\n\
    \   communication ports (comparable to UDP ports) on the device.  Certain\n  \
    \ proprietary systems (for example, the Wireless Application Protocol\n   [WAP])\
    \ define configuration messages that may be used to reconfigure\n   the devices\
    \ remotely.  Any SMS client SHOULD make sure that malicious\n   use of such messages\
    \ is not possible, for example, by filtering out\n   certain SMS User Data header\
    \ fields.  Gateways that accept SMS\n   messages (e.g., in email messages or Web\
    \ forms) and pass them on to\n   an SMSC SHOULD implement this kind of \"firewalling\"\
    \ approach as well.\n   Because of the narrow bandwidth of the SMS communications\
    \ channel,\n   there should also be checks in place for excessively long\n   concatenated\
    \ messages.  As an example, it may take two minutes to\n   transfer thirty concatenated\
    \ text messages.\n   Unchecked input from a user MUST NOT be used to populate\
    \ any other\n   fields in an SMS message other than the User Data field (not\n\
    \   including the User Data header field).  All other parts, including\n   the\
    \ User Data header, of the short message should only be generated\n   by trusted\
    \ means.\n   By including \"sms\" URIs in unsolicited messages (a.k.a. \"spam\"\
    ) or\n   other types of advertising, the originator of the \"sms\" URIs may\n\
    \   attempt to reveal an individual's phone number and/or to link the\n   identity\
    \ (i.e., email address) used for messaging with the identity\n   (i.e., phone\
    \ number) used for the mobile phone.  This attempt to\n   collect information\
    \ may be a privacy issue, and user agents may make\n   users aware of that risk\
    \ before composing or sending SMS messages.\n   Users agents that do not provide\
    \ any feedback about this privacy\n   issue make users more vulnerable to this\
    \ kind of attack.\n   A user agent SHOULD NOT send out SMS messages without the\
    \ knowledge\n   of the user because of associated risks, which include sending\
    \ masses\n   of SMS messages to a subscriber without his consent, and the costs\n\
    \   involved in sending an SMS message.\n   As suggested functionality, the user\
    \ agent MAY offer a possibility\n   for the user to filter out those phone numbers\
    \ that are expressed in\n   local format, as most premium-rate numbers are expressed\
    \ in local\n   format, and because determining the correct local context (and\
    \ hence\n   the validity of the number to this specific user) may be very\n  \
    \ difficult.\n   When using \"sms\" URIs as targets of forms (as described in\n\
    \   Section 2.6), the user agent SHOULD inform the user about the\n   possible\
    \ security hazards involved when submitting the form (it is\n   probably being\
    \ sent as plain text over an air interface).\n"
