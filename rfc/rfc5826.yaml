  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document presents requirements specific to home control\
    \ and\n   automation applications for Routing Over Low power and Lossy (ROLL)\n\
    \   networks.  In the near future, many homes will contain high numbers\n   of\
    \ wireless devices for a wide set of purposes.  Examples include\n   actuators\
    \ (relay, light dimmer, heating valve), sensors (wall switch,\n   water leak,\
    \ blood pressure), and advanced controllers.  Basic home-\n   control modules\
    \ such as wall switches and plug-in modules may be\n   turned into an advanced\
    \ home automation solution via the use of an\n   IP-enabled application responding\
    \ to events generated by wall\n   switches, motion sensors, light sensors, rain\
    \ sensors, and so on.\n   Network nodes may be sensors and actuators at the same\
    \ time.  An\n   example is a wall switch for replacement in existing homes.  The\
    \ push\n   buttons may generate events for a controller node or for activating\n\
    \   other actuator nodes.  At the same time, a built-in relay may act as\n   actuator\
    \ for a controller or other remote sensors.\n   Because ROLL nodes only cover\
    \ a limited radio range, routing is often\n   required.  These devices are usually\
    \ highly constrained in terms of\n   resources such as battery and memory and\
    \ operate in unstable\n   environments.  Persons moving around in a house, opening\
    \ or closing a\n   door, or starting a microwave oven affect the reception of\
    \ weak radio\n   signals.  Reflection and absorption may cause a reliable radio\
    \ link\n   to turn unreliable for a period of time and then become reusable\n\
    \   again, thus the term \"lossy\".  All traffic in a ROLL network is\n   carried\
    \ as IPv6 packets.\n   The connected home area is very much consumer oriented.\
    \  The\n   implication on network nodes is that devices are very cost sensitive,\n\
    \   which leads to resource-constrained environments having slow CPUs and\n  \
    \ small memory footprints.  At the same time, nodes have to be\n   physically\
    \ small, which puts a limit to the physical size of the\n   battery, and thus,\
    \ the battery capacity.  As a result, it is common\n   for battery-operated, sensor-style\
    \ nodes to shut down radio and CPU\n   resources for most of the time.  The radio\
    \ tends to use the same\n   power for listening as for transmitting.\n   Although\
    \ this document focuses its text on radio-based wireless\n   networks, home-automation\
    \ networks may also operate using a variety\n   of links, such as IEEE 802.15.4,\
    \ Bluetooth, Low-Power WiFi, wired or\n   other low-power PLC (Power-Line Communication)\
    \ links.  Many such low-\n   power link technologies share similar characteristics\
    \ with low-power\n   wireless and this document should be regarded as applying\
    \ equally to\n   all such links.\n   Section 2 describes a few typical use cases\
    \ for home automation\n   applications.  Section 3 discusses the routing requirements\
    \ for\n   networks comprising such constrained devices in a home network\n   environment.\
    \  These requirements may be overlapping requirements\n   derived from other application-specific\
    \ routing requirements\n   presented in [BUILDING-REQS], [RFC5673], and [RFC5548].\n\
    \   A full list of requirements documents may be found in Section 7.\n"

- title: 2.  Home Automation Applications
  contents:
  - "2.  Home Automation Applications\n   Home automation applications represent a\
    \ special segment of networked\n   devices with its unique set of requirements.\
    \  Historically, such\n   applications used wired networks or power-line communication\
    \ (PLC)\n   but wireless solutions have emerged, allowing existing homes to be\n\
    \   upgraded more easily.\n   To facilitate the requirements discussion in Section\
    \ 3, this section\n   lists a few typical use cases of home automation applications.\
    \  New\n   applications are being developed at a high pace and this section does\n\
    \   not mean to be exhaustive.  Most home automation applications tend to\n  \
    \ be running some kind of command/response protocol.  The command may\n   come\
    \ from several places.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Lighting Application in Action
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Lighting Application in Action\n   A lamp may be turned on, not only by\
    \ a wall switch but also by a\n   movement sensor.  The wall-switch module may\
    \ itself be a push-button\n   sensor and an actuator at the same time.  This will\
    \ often be the case\n   when upgrading existing homes as existing wiring is not\
    \ prepared for\n   automation.\n   One event may cause many actuators to be activated\
    \ at the same time.\n   Using the direct analogy to an electronic car key, a house\
    \ owner may\n   activate the \"leaving home\" function from an electronic house\
    \ key,\n   mobile phone, etc.  For the sake of visual impression, all lights\n\
    \   should turn off at the same time; at least, it should appear to\n   happen\
    \ at the same time.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Energy Conservation and Optimizing Energy Consumption
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Energy Conservation and Optimizing Energy Consumption\n   In order to save\
    \ energy, air conditioning, central heating, window\n   shades, etc., may be controlled\
    \ by timers, motion sensors, or\n   remotely via Internet or cell.  Central heating\
    \ may also be set to a\n   reduced temperature during nighttime.\n   The power\
    \ grid may experience periods where more wind-generated power\n   is produced\
    \ than is needed.  Typically this may happen during night\n   hours.\n   In periods\
    \ where electricity demands exceed available supply,\n   appliances such as air\
    \ conditioning, climate-control systems, washing\n   machines, etc., can be turned\
    \ off to avoid overloading the power\n   grid.\n   This is known as Demand-Side\
    \ Management (DSM).  Remote control of\n   household appliances is well-suited\
    \ for this application.\n   The start/stop decision for the appliances can also\
    \ be regulated by\n   dynamic power pricing information obtained from the electricity\n\
    \   utility companies.  This method, called Demand-Response (DR), works\n   by\
    \ motivation of users via pricing, bonus points, etc.  For example,\n   the washing\
    \ machine and dish washer may just as well work while power\n   is cheap.  The\
    \ electric car should also charge its batteries on cheap\n   power.\n   In order\
    \ to achieve effective electricity savings, the energy\n   monitoring application\
    \ must guarantee that the power consumption of\n   the ROLL devices is much lower\
    \ than that of the appliance itself.\n   Most of these appliances are mains powered\
    \ and are thus ideal for\n   providing reliable, always-on routing resources.\
    \  Battery-powered\n   nodes, by comparison, are constrained routing resources\
    \ and may only\n   provide reliable routing under some circumstances.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.3.  Moving a Remote Control Around\n   A remote control is a typical example\
    \ of a mobile device in a home\n   automation network.  An advanced remote control\
    \ may be used for\n   dimming the light in the dining room while eating and later\
    \ on,\n   turning up the music while doing the dishes in the kitchen.  Reaction\n\
    \   must appear to be instant (within a few hundred milliseconds) even\n   when\
    \ the remote control has moved to a new location.  The remote\n   control may\
    \ be communicating to either a central home automation\n   controller or directly\
    \ to the lamps and the media center.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Adding a New Module to the System
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Adding a New Module to the System\n   Small-size, low-cost modules may\
    \ have no user interface except for a\n   single button.  Thus, an automated inclusion\
    \ process is needed for\n   controllers to find new modules.  Inclusion covers\
    \ the detection of\n   neighbors and the assignment of a unique node ID.  Inclusion\
    \ should\n   be completed within a few seconds.\n   For ease of use in a consumer\
    \ application space such as home control,\n   nodes may be included without having\
    \ to type in special codes before\n   inclusion.  One way to achieve an acceptable\
    \ balance between security\n   and convenience is to block inclusion during normal\
    \ operation,\n   explicitly enable inclusion support just before adding a new\
    \ module,\n   and disable it again just after adding a new module.\n   For security\
    \ considerations, refer to Section 5.\n   If assignment of unique addresses is\
    \ performed by a central\n   controller, it must be possible to route the inclusion\
    \ request from\n   the joining node to the central controller before the joining\
    \ node\n   has been included in the network.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Controlling Battery-Operated Window Shades
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Controlling Battery-Operated Window Shades\n   In consumer premises, window\
    \ shades are often battery-powered as\n   there is no access to mains power over\
    \ the windows.  For battery\n   conservation purposes, such an actuator node is\
    \ sleeping most of the\n   time.  A controller sending commands to a sleeping\
    \ actuator node via\n   ROLL devices will have no problems delivering the packet\
    \ to the\n   nearest powered router, but that router may experience a delay until\n\
    \   the next wake-up time before the command can be delivered.\n"
- title: 2.6.  Remote Video Surveillance
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Remote Video Surveillance\n   Remote video surveillance is a fairly classic\
    \ application for home\n   networking.  It provides the ability for the end-user\
    \ to get a video\n   stream from a web cam reached via the Internet.  The video\
    \ stream may\n   be triggered by the end-user after receiving an alarm from a\
    \ sensor\n   (movement or smoke detector) or the user simply wants to check the\n\
    \   home status via video.\n   Note that in the former case, more than likely,\
    \ there will be a form\n   of inter-device communication: upon detecting some\
    \ movement in the\n   home, the movement sensor may send a request to the light\
    \ controller\n   to turn on the lights, to the Web Cam to start a video stream\
    \ that\n   would then be directed to the end-user's cell phone or Personal\n \
    \  Digital Assistant (PDA) via the Internet.\n   In contrast to other applications,\
    \ e.g., industrial sensors, where\n   data would mainly be originated by a sensor\
    \ to a sink and vice versa,\n   this scenario implicates a direct inter-device\
    \ communication between\n   ROLL devices.\n"
- title: 2.7.  Healthcare
  contents:
  - "2.7.  Healthcare\n   By adding communication capability to devices, patients\
    \ and elderly\n   citizens may be able to do simple measurements at home.\n  \
    \ Thanks to online devices, a doctor can keep an eye on the patient's\n   health\
    \ and receive warnings if a new trend is discovered by automated\n   filters.\n\
    \   Fine-grained, daily measurements presented in proper ways may allow\n   the\
    \ doctor to establish a more precise diagnosis.\n   Such applications may be realized\
    \ as wearable products that\n   frequently do a measurement and automatically\
    \ deliver the result to a\n   data sink locally or over the Internet.\n   Applications\
    \ falling in this category are referred to as at-home\n   health reporting.  Whether\
    \ measurements are done in a fixed interval\n   or they are manually activated,\
    \ they leave all processing to the\n   receiving data sink.\n   A more active\
    \ category of applications may send an alarm if some\n   alarm condition is triggered.\
    \  This category of applications is\n   referred to as at-home health monitoring.\
    \  Measurements are\n   interpreted in the device and may cause reporting of an\
    \ event if an\n   alarm is triggered.\n   Many implementations may overlap both\
    \ categories.\n   Since wireless and battery operated systems may never reach\
    \ 100%\n   guaranteed operational time, healthcare and security systems will\n\
    \   need a management layer implementing alarm mechanisms for low\n   battery,\
    \ report activity, etc.\n   For instance, if a blood pressure sensor did not report\
    \ a new\n   measurement, say five minutes after the scheduled time, some\n   responsible\
    \ person must be notified.\n   The structure and performance of such a management\
    \ layer is outside\n   the scope of the routing requirements listed in this document.\n"

- title: 2.8.  Alarm Systems
  contents:
  - "2.8.  Alarm Systems\n   A home security alarm system is comprised of various\
    \ sensors\n   (vibration, fire, carbon monoxide, door/window, glass-break,\n \
    \  presence, panic button, etc.).\n   Some smoke alarms are battery powered and\
    \ at the same time mounted in\n   a high place.  Battery-powered safety devices\
    \ should only be used for\n   routing if no other alternatives exist to avoid\
    \ draining the battery.\n   A smoke alarm with a drained battery does not provide\
    \ a lot of\n   safety.  Also, it may be inconvenient to change the batteries in\
    \ a\n   smoke alarm.\n   Alarm system applications may have both a synchronous\
    \ and an\n   asynchronous behavior; i.e., they may be periodically queried by\
    \ a\n   central control application (e.g., for a periodical refreshment of\n \
    \  the network state) or send a message to the control application on\n   their\
    \ own initiative.\n   When a node (or a group of nodes) identifies a risk situation\
    \ (e.g.,\n   intrusion, smoke, fire), it sends an alarm message to a central\n\
    \   controller that could autonomously forward it via the Internet or\n   interact\
    \ with other network nodes (e.g., try to obtain more detailed\n   information\
    \ or ask other nodes close to the alarm event).\n   Finally, routing via battery-powered\
    \ nodes may be very slow if the\n   nodes are sleeping most of the time (they\
    \ could appear unresponsive\n   to the alarm detection).  To ensure fast message\
    \ delivery and avoid\n   battery drain, routing should be avoided via sleeping\
    \ devices.\n"

  - "3.1.  Constraint-Based Routing\n   For convenience and low-operational costs,\
    \ power consumption of\n   consumer products must be kept at a very low level\
    \ to achieve a long\n   battery lifetime.  One implication of this fact is that\
    \ Random Access\n   Memory (RAM) is limited and it may even be powered down, leaving\
    \ only\n   a few 100 bytes of RAM alive during the sleep phase.\n   The use of\
    \ battery-powered devices reduces installation costs and\n   does enable installation\
    \ of devices even where main power lines are\n   not available.  On the other\
    \ hand, in order to be cost effective and\n   efficient, the devices have to maximize\
    \ the sleep phase with a duty\n   cycle lower than 1%.\n   Some devices only wake\
    \ up in response to an event, e.g., a push\n   button.\n   Simple battery-powered\
    \ nodes such as movement sensors on garage doors\n   and rain sensors may not\
    \ be able to assist in routing.  Depending on\n   the node type, the node never\
    \ listens at all, listens rarely, or\n   makes contact on demand to a pre-configured\
    \ target node.  Attempting\n   to communicate with such nodes may at best require\
    \ a long time before\n   getting a response.\n   Other battery-powered nodes may\
    \ have the capability to participate in\n   routing.  The routing protocol SHOULD\
    \ route via mains-powered nodes\n   if possible.\n   The routing protocol MUST\
    \ support constraint-based routing taking\n   into account node properties (CPU,\
    \ memory, level of energy, sleep\n   intervals, safety/convenience of changing\
    \ battery).\n"
- title: 3.2.  Support of Mobility
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Support of Mobility\n   In a home environment, although the majority of\
    \ devices are fixed\n   devices, there is still a variety of mobile devices, for\
    \ example, a\n   remote control is likely to move.  Another example of mobile\
    \ devices\n   is wearable healthcare devices.\n   While healthcare devices delivering\
    \ measurement results can tolerate\n   route discovery times measured in seconds,\
    \ a remote control appears\n   unresponsive if using more than 0.5 seconds to,\
    \ e.g., pause the\n   music.\n   On more rare occasions, receiving nodes may also\
    \ have moved.\n   Examples include a safety-off switch in a clothes iron, a vacuum\n\
    \   cleaner robot, or the wireless chime of doorbell set.\n   Refer to Section\
    \ 3.4 for routing protocol convergence times.\n   A non-responsive node can either\
    \ be caused by 1) a failure in the\n   node, 2) a failed link on the path to the\
    \ node, or 3) a moved node.\n   In the first two cases, the node can be expected\
    \ to reappear at\n   roughly the same location in the network, whereas it can\
    \ return\n   anywhere in the network in the latter case.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Scalability
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Scalability\n   Looking at the number of wall switches, power outlets,\
    \ sensors of\n   various natures, video equipment, and so on in a modern house,\
    \ it\n   seems quite realistic that hundreds of devices may form a home-\n   automation\
    \ network in a fully populated \"smart\" home, and a large\n   proportion of those\
    \ may be low-power devices.  Moving towards\n   professional-building automation,\
    \ the number of such devices may be\n   in the order of several thousands.\n \
    \  The routing protocol needs to be able to support a basic home\n   deployment\
    \ and so MUST be able to support at least 250 devices in the\n   network.  Furthermore,\
    \ the protocol SHOULD be extensible to support\n   more sophisticated and future\
    \ deployments with a larger number of\n   devices.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Convergence Time
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Convergence Time\n   A wireless home automation network is subject to various\n\
    \   instabilities due to signal strength variation, moving persons, and\n   the\
    \ like.\n   Measured from the transmission of a packet, the following convergence\n\
    \   time requirements apply.\n   The routing protocol MUST converge within 0.5\
    \ seconds if no nodes\n   have moved (see Section 3.2 for motivation).\n   The\
    \ routing protocol MUST converge within four seconds if nodes have\n   moved to\
    \ re-establish connectivity within a time that a human\n   operator would find\
    \ tolerable as, for example, when moving a remote\n   control unit.\n   In both\
    \ cases, \"converge\" means \"the originator node has received a\n   response\
    \ from the destination node\".  The above-mentioned convergence\n   time requirements\
    \ apply to a home control network environment of up\n   to 250 nodes with up to\
    \ four repeating nodes between source and\n   destination.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Manageability
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Manageability\n   The ability of the home network to support auto-configuration\
    \ is of\n   the utmost importance.  Indeed, most end-users will not have the\n\
    \   expertise and the skills to perform advanced configuration and\n   troubleshooting.\
    \  Thus, the routing protocol designed for home-\n   automation networks MUST\
    \ provide a set of features including zero-\n   configuration of the routing protocol\
    \ for a new node to be added to\n   the network.  From a routing perspective,\
    \ zero-configuration means\n   that a node can obtain an address and join the\
    \ network on its own,\n   almost without human intervention.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Stability
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Stability\n   If a node is found to fail often compared to the rest of\
    \ the network,\n   this node SHOULD NOT be the first choice for routing of traffic.\n"
- title: 4.  Traffic Pattern
  contents:
  - "4.  Traffic Pattern\n   Depending on the design philosophy of the home network,\
    \ wall switches\n   may be configured to directly control individual lamps or\n\
    \   alternatively, all wall switches send control commands to a central\n   lighting\
    \ control computer, which again sends out control commands to\n   relevant devices.\n\
    \   In a distributed system, the traffic tends to be multipoint-to-\n   multipoint.\
    \  In a centralized system, it is a mix of multipoint-to-\n   point and point-to-multipoint.\n\
    \   Wall switches only generate traffic when activated, which typically\n   happens\
    \ from one to ten times per hour.\n   Remote controls have a similar transmit\
    \ pattern to wall switches but\n   may be activated more frequently in some deployments.\n\
    \   Temperature/air and pressure/rain sensors send frames when queried by\n  \
    \ the user or can be preconfigured to send measurements at fixed\n   intervals\
    \ (typically minutes).  Motion sensors typically send a frame\n   when motion\
    \ is first detected and another frame when an idle period\n   with no movement\
    \ has elapsed.  The highest transmission frequency\n   depends on the idle period\
    \ used in the sensor.  Sometimes, a timer\n   will trigger a frame transmission\
    \ when an extended period without\n   status change has elapsed.\n   All frames\
    \ sent in the above examples are quite short, typically less\n   than five bytes\
    \ of payload.  Lost frames and interference from other\n   transmitters may lead\
    \ to retransmissions.  In all cases,\n   acknowledgment frames with a size of\
    \ a few bytes are used.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   As is the case with every network, LLNs are exposed\
    \ to routing\n   security threats that need to be addressed.  The wireless and\n\
    \   distributed nature of these networks increases the spectrum of\n   potential\
    \ routing security threats.  This is further amplified by the\n   resource constraints\
    \ of the nodes, thereby preventing resource-\n   intensive routing security approaches\
    \ from being deployed.  A viable\n   routing security approach SHOULD be sufficiently\
    \ lightweight that it\n   may be implemented across all nodes in a LLN.  These\
    \ issues require\n   special attention during the design process, so as to facilitate\
    \ a\n   commercially attractive deployment.\n   An attacker can snoop, replay,\
    \ or originate arbitrary messages to a\n   node in an attempt to manipulate or\
    \ disable the routing function.\n   To mitigate this, the LLN MUST be able to\
    \ authenticate a new node\n   prior to allowing it to participate in the routing\
    \ decision process.\n   The routing protocol MUST support message integrity.\n\
    \   A further example of routing security issues that may arise is the\n   abnormal\
    \ behavior of nodes that exhibit an egoistic conduct, such as\n   not obeying\
    \ network rules or forwarding no or false packets.\n   Other important issues\
    \ may arise in the context of denial-of-service\n   (DoS) attacks, malicious address\
    \ space allocations, advertisement of\n   variable addresses, a wrong neighborhood,\
    \ etc.  The routing\n   protocol(s) SHOULD support defense against DoS attacks\
    \ and other\n   attempts to maliciously or inadvertently cause the mechanisms\
    \ of the\n   routing protocol(s) to over-consume the limited resources of LLN\n\
    \   nodes, e.g., by constructing forwarding loops or causing excessive\n   routing\
    \ protocol overhead traffic, etc.\n   The properties of self-configuration and\
    \ self-organization that are\n   desirable in a LLN introduce additional routing\
    \ security\n   considerations.  Mechanisms MUST be in place to deny any node that\n\
    \   attempts to take malicious advantage of self-configuration and self-\n   organization\
    \ procedures.  Such attacks may attempt, for example, to\n   cause DoS, drain\
    \ the energy of power-constrained devices, or to\n   hijack the routing mechanism.\
    \  A node MUST authenticate itself to a\n   trusted node that is already associated\
    \ with the LLN before the\n   former can take part in self-configuration or self-organization.\
    \  A\n   node that has already authenticated and associated with the LLN MUST\n\
    \   deny, to the maximum extent possible, the allocation of resources to\n   any\
    \ unauthenticated peer.  The routing protocol(s) MUST deny service\n   to any\
    \ node that has not clearly established trust with the HC-LLN.\n   In a home-control\
    \ environment, it is considered unlikely that a\n   network is constantly being\
    \ snooped and at the same time, ease of use\n   is important.  As a consequence,\
    \ the network key MAY be exposed for\n   short periods during inclusion of new\
    \ nodes.\n   Electronic door locks and other critical applications SHOULD apply\n\
    \   end-to-end application security on top of the network transport\n   security.\n\
    \   If connected to a backbone network, the LLN SHOULD be capable of\n   limiting\
    \ the resources utilized by nodes in said backbone network so\n   as not to be\
    \ vulnerable to DoS.  This should typically be handled by\n   border routers providing\
    \ access from a backbone network to resources\n   in the LLN.\n   With low-computation\
    \ power and scarce energy resources, LLNs' nodes\n   may not be able to resist\
    \ any attack from high-power malicious nodes\n   (e.g., laptops and strong radios).\
    \  However, the amount of damage\n   generated to the whole network SHOULD be\
    \ commensurate with the number\n   of nodes physically compromised.  For example,\
    \ an intruder taking\n   control over a single node SHOULD NOT be able to completely\
    \ deny\n   service to the whole network.\n   In general, the routing protocol(s)\
    \ SHOULD support the implementation\n   of routing security best practices across\
    \ the LLN.  Such an\n   implementation ought to include defense against, for example,\n\
    \   eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, modification, and man-in-\n   the-middle\
    \ attacks.\n   The choice of the routing security solutions will have an impact\
    \ on\n   the routing protocol(s).  To this end, routing protocol(s) proposed\n\
    \   in the context of LLNs MUST support authentication and integrity\n   measures\
    \ and SHOULD support confidentiality (routing security)\n   measures.\n"
