- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Server-based Certificate Validation Protocol (SCVP) defines\
    \ an\n   extensible means of delegating the development and validation of\n  \
    \ certification paths to a server.  It can be used to support the\n   development\
    \ and validation of certification paths well after the\n   expiration of the certificates\
    \ in the path by specifying a time of\n   interest in the past.  The Evidence\
    \ Record Syntax (ERS) defines\n   structures, called evidence records, to support\
    \ the non-repudiation\n   of the existence of data.  Evidence records can be used\
    \ to preserve\n   materials that comprise a certification path such that trust\
    \ in the\n   certificates can be established after the expiration of the\n   certificates\
    \ in the path and after the cryptographic algorithms used\n   to sign the certificates\
    \ in the path are no longer secure.  This\n   document describes usage of the\
    \ SCVP WantBack feature to convey\n   evidence records, enabling SCVP responders\
    \ to provide preservation\n   evidence for certificates and certificate revocation\
    \ lists (CRLs).\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Digital signatures are frequently verified using public\
    \ key\n   infrastructure (PKI) artifacts, including public key certificates and\n\
    \   certificate revocation information.  Verifiers construct and validate\n  \
    \ certification paths from a public key certificate containing the\n   public\
    \ key used to verify the signature to a trusted public key.\n   Construction of\
    \ a certification path may require the acquisition of\n   different types of information\
    \ generated by multiple PKIs.  To verify\n   digital signatures many years after\
    \ signature generation, additional\n   considerations must be addressed.  For\
    \ example, some necessary PKI\n   artifacts may no longer be available, some may\
    \ have expired, and the\n   cryptographic algorithms or keys used in generating\
    \ digital\n   signatures may no longer provide the desired degree of security.\n\
    \   SCVP [RFC5055] provides a means of delegating certification path\n   construction\
    \ and/or validation to a server, including the ability to\n   request the status\
    \ of a certificate relative to a time in the past.\n   SCVP does not define a\
    \ means of providing or validating long-term\n   non-repudiation information.\
    \  ERS [RFC4998] defines a syntax for\n   preserving materials over long periods\
    \ of time through a regimen that\n   includes periodic re-signing of relevant\
    \ materials using newer keys\n   and stronger cryptographic algorithms.  LTAP\
    \ [LTANS-LTAP] defines a\n   protocol for communicating with a long-term archive\
    \ (LTA) server for\n   the purpose of preserving evidence records and data.  Clients\
    \ store,\n   retrieve, and delete data using LTAP; LTAs maintain evidence records\n\
    \   covering data submitted by clients.\n   This document defines an application\
    \ of SCVP to permit retrieval of\n   an evidence record corresponding to information\
    \ returned by the SCVP\n   server by creating an association between an evidence\
    \ record and\n   information contained in an SCVP response.  The SCVP response\
    \ can\n   then in turn be used to verify archived data objects retrieved using\n\
    \   LTAP.  Separating the preservation of the certification path\n   information\
    \ from the preservation of data enables the LTA to store\n   archived data objects\
    \ more efficiently, i.e., complete verification\n   information need not be stored\
    \ with each archived data object.\n   Verifiers can more efficiently process archived\
    \ data objects by\n   reusing the same certification path information to verify\
    \ multiple\n   archived data objects of similar vintage without retrieving and/or\n\
    \   validating the same PKI artifacts multiple times.\n"

    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Concept of Operations
  contents:
  - "2.  Concept of Operations\n   During certification path processing, active SCVP\
    \ servers may\n   encounter a large portion of the PKI artifacts generated by\
    \ a\n   particular PKI.  By storing and preserving these artifacts, an SCVP\n\
    \   server can respond to queries for certificate status over very long\n   periods\
    \ of time.  Optionally, SCVP servers may actively seek PKI\n   information for\
    \ storage and preservation, even when no query is made,\n   that requires the\
    \ information during its period of validity in order\n   to service future queries\
    \ relative to any point in time.\n   SCVP permits clients to request as much or\
    \ as little information as\n   desired from the SCVP server.  Clients include\
    \ zero or more Object\n   Identifiers (OIDs) indicating the type(s) of information\
    \ the server\n   should include in the response.  By defining additional OID values,\n\
    \   clients can request an evidence record for specific types of\n   information\
    \ returned by the SCVP server.  This document defines OIDs\n   to permit the retrieval\
    \ of evidence records for the following four\n   types of information:\n   o \
    \ end entity certificates.\n   o  certification paths containing an end entity\
    \ certificate up to a\n      trust anchor.\n   o  certification paths containing\
    \ an intermediate certificate up to a\n      trust anchor.\n   o  revocation information.\n\
    \   Additionally, an OID is defined to permit inclusion of a single OID\n   indicating\
    \ an evidence record is desired for all information\n   requested via the WantBack\
    \ mechanism.\n   By associating evidence records with information maintained by\
    \ an\n   SCVP server, clients are able to determine the status of certificates\n\
    \   over very long periods of time using SCVP without consulting\n   additional\
    \ resources.  The nature of SCVP servers is well suited to\n   the preservation\
    \ of infrastructure materials.  Additionally, the SCVP\n   server's signature\
    \ over an SCVP response can secure the transmission\n   of trust anchors included\
    \ in evidence records, allowing clients to\n   refrain from establishing additional\
    \ trust relationships with LTAs.\n   The transactions used to verify an archived\
    \ data object using LTAP\n   and the SCVP WantBacks described in this document\
    \ are as follows:\n   o  Client retrieves a signed archived data object from an\
    \ LTA using\n      LTAP.\n   o  Client prepares an SCVP request to validate the\
    \ signer's\n      certificate at the time of interest and includes WantBacks for\n\
    \      evidence records corresponding to the PKI artifacts required to\n     \
    \ validate the signer's certificate.\n   o  SCVP server returns a response with\
    \ status as of the time of\n      interest and includes requested evidence records.\n\
    \   o  Client processes the SCVP request, determines the status, and\n      verifies\
    \ the evidence records.\n   o  Client verifies signatures in the archived data\
    \ object using the\n      validated signer's certificate.\n"
- title: 3.  Requests
  contents:
  - "3.  Requests\n   Clients request long-term archive evidence records from an SCVP\n\
    \   server by including one of the following OIDs in the wantBack field\n   of\
    \ a CVRequest sent to an SCVP server:\n   o  id-swb-ers-best-cert-path\n   o \
    \ id-swb-ers-partial-cert-path\n   o  id-swb-ers-pkc-cert\n   o  id-swb-ers-revocation-info\n\
    \   o  id-swb-ers-all\n   Additionally, id-swb-partial-cert-path is defined to\
    \ permit clients\n   to request a partial certification path consisting of the\n\
    \   certification authority (CA) that issued the end entity certificate\n   through\
    \ a trust anchor.  This is similar to the id-swb-best-cert-path\n   WantBack defined\
    \ in SCVP except the resulting replyWantBack will\n   contain a CertBundle containing\
    \ the certification path minus the end\n   entity certificate.\n   For each id-swb-ers\
    \ OID except id-swb-ers-all, an EvidenceRecord (as\n   defined in [RFC4998]) covering\
    \ the corresponding information in the\n   response will be returned as a replyWantBack.\
    \  For example, if a\n   client wishes to obtain a certification path and revocation\n\
    \   information plus an evidence record for each, the SCVP request would\n   include\
    \ the following four replyWantBack OIDs: id-swb-best-cert-path,\n   id-swb-pkc-revocation-info,\
    \ id-swb-ers-best-cert-path, and id-swb-\n   ers-revocation-info.\n   Alternatively,\
    \ for id-swb-ers-all, an EvidenceRecordWantBacks\n   structure will be returned\
    \ containing an EvidenceRecord for each\n   information item contained in the\
    \ replyWantBacks field.  For example,\n   if a client wishes to obtain a certification\
    \ path and revocation\n   information plus an evidence record for each, the SCVP\
    \ request could\n   include the following three replyWantBack OIDs: id-swb-best-cert-\n\
    \   path, id-swb-pkc-revocation-info, and id-swb-ers-all.\n"
- title: 4.  Responses
  contents:
  - "4.  Responses\n   When a client request contains a WantBack request for an evidence\n\
    \   record, the response generated MUST include the replyWantBack\n   containing\
    \ the requested information plus a replyWantBack containing\n   the evidence record\
    \ corresponding to that information.  For each id-\n   swb-ers OID except id-swb-ers-pkc-cert\
    \ and id-swb-ers-revocation-\n   info, the evidence record MUST be calculated\
    \ over the value of the\n   value field in the corresponding replyWantBack; the\
    \ tag and length\n   bytes are not covered by the evidence record.  The targets\
    \ for the\n   id-swb-ers-pkc-cert and id-swb-ers-revocation-info replyWantBacks\
    \ are\n   described below.  For example, if a client request contains id-swb-\n\
    \   pkc-best-cert-path and id-swb-ers-best-cert-path, the resulting\n   response\
    \ will contain a replyWantBack of each type where the evidence\n   record covers\
    \ the DER-encoded CertBundle returned in the id-swb-pkc-\n   best-cert-path replyWantBack.\
    \  For id-swb-ers-pkc-cert, the evidence\n   record MUST be calculated over the\
    \ value of the cert field in the\n   CertReply object.  For id-swb-ers-revocation-info,\
    \ a sequence of\n   evidence records is returned.  Each revocation information\
    \ object\n   contained in the id-swb-pkc-revocation-info replyWantBack is covered\n\
    \   by an evidence record in the id-swb-ers-revocation-info\n   replyWantBack.\
    \  A single evidence record may cover multiple\n   revocation information objects.\
    \  The correct evidence record can be\n   identified by locating the hash of the\
    \ revocation information object\n   in the first initial timestamp of the evidence\
    \ record.\n   If the server cannot return an EvidenceRecord for the requested\n\
    \   information item, a replyWantBack of the appropriate type MUST be\n   returned\
    \ with an empty value field.  For example, if a client\n   requests id-swb-ers-pkc-cert\
    \ and the server cannot fulfill the\n   request, the resulting response will contain\
    \ a replyWantBack with the\n   wb field set to id-swb-ers-pkc-cert and the value\
