- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   This memo describes the use of the Border Gateway Protocol\
    \ (BGP) [1]\n   in the Internet environment. BGP is an inter-Autonomous System\n\
    \   routing protocol. The network reachability information exchanged via\n   BGP\
    \ provides sufficient information to detect routing loops and\n   enforce routing\
    \ decisions based on performance preference and policy\n   constraints as outlined\
    \ in RFC 1104 [2]. In particular, BGP exchanges\n   routing information containing\
    \ full AS paths and enforces routing\n   policies based on configuration information.\n\
    \   All of the discussions in this paper are based on the assumption that\n  \
    \ the Internet is a collection of arbitrarily connected Autonomous\n   Systems.\
    \ That is, the Internet will be modeled as a general graph\n   whose nodes are\
    \ AS's and whose edges are connections between pairs of\n   AS's.\n   The classic\
    \ definition of an Autonomous System is a set of routers\n   under a single technical\
    \ administration, using an interior gateway\n   protocol and common metrics to\
    \ route packets within the AS, and using\n   an exterior gateway protocol to route\
    \ packets to other AS's. Since\n   this classic definition was developed, it has\
    \ become common for a\n   single AS to use several interior gateway protocols\
    \ and sometimes\n   several sets of metrics within an AS. The use of the term\
    \ Autonomous\n   System here stresses the fact that, even when multiple IGPs and\n\
    \   metrics are used, the administration of an AS appears to other AS's\n   to\
    \ have a single coherent interior routing plan and presents a\n   consistent picture\
    \ of which networks are reachable through it. From\n   the standpoint of exterior\
    \ routing, an AS can be viewed as\n   monolithic: networks within an AS must maintain\
    \ connectivity via\n   intra-AS paths.\n   AS's are assumed to be administered\
    \ by a single administrative\n   entity, at least for the purposes of representation\
    \ of routing\n   information to systems outside of the AS.\n"
- title: 2. BGP Topological Model
  contents:
  - "2. BGP Topological Model\n   When we say that a connection exists between two\
    \ AS's, we mean two\n   things:\n      Physical connection:  There is a shared\
    \ network between the two\n      AS's, and on this shared network each AS has\
    \ at least one border\n      gateway belonging to that AS. Thus the border gateway\
    \ of each AS\n      can forward packets to the border gateway of the other AS\
    \ without\n      resort to Inter-AS or Intra-AS routing.\n      BGP connection:\
    \  There is a BGP session between BGP speakers on\n      each of the AS's, and\
    \ this session communicates to each connected\n      AS those routes through the\
    \ physically connected border gateways\n      of the other AS that can be used\
    \ for specific networks. Throughout\n      this document we place an additional\
    \ restriction on the BGP\n      speakers that form the BGP connection: they must\
    \ themselves share\n      the same network that their border gateways share. Thus,\
    \ a BGP\n      session between the adjacent AS's requires no support from either\n\
    \      Inter-AS or Intra-AS routing. Cases that do not conform to this\n     \
    \ restriction fall outside the scope of this document.\n   Thus, at each connection,\
    \ each AS has one or more BGP speakers and\n   one or more border gateways, and\
    \ these BGP speakers and border\n   gateways are all located on a shared network.\
    \ Note that BGP speakers\n   do not need to be a border gateway, and vice versa.\
    \ Paths announced\n   by a BGP speaker of one AS on a given connection are taken\
    \ to be\n   feasible for each of the border gateways of the other AS on the same\n\
    \   connection, i.e. indirect neighbors are allowed.\n   Much of the traffic carried\
    \ within an AS either originates or\n   terminates at that AS (i.e., either the\
    \ source IP address or the\n   destination IP address of the IP packet identifies\
    \ a host on a\n   network directly connected to that AS).  Traffic that fits this\n\
    \   description is called \"local traffic\". Traffic that does not fit this\n\
    \   description is called \"transit traffic\". A major goal of BGP usage is\n\
    \   to control the flow of transit traffic.\n   Based on how a particular AS deals\
    \ with transit traffic, the AS may\n   now be placed into one of the following\
    \ categories:\n      stub AS: an AS that has only a single connection to one other\
    \ AS.\n      Naturally, a stub AS only carries local traffic.\n      multihomed\
    \ AS: an AS that has connections to more than one other\n      AS, but refuses\
    \ to carry transit traffic.\n      transit AS: an AS that has connections to more\
    \ than one other AS,\n      and is designed (under certain policy restrictions)\
    \ to carry both\n      transit and local traffic.\n   Since a full AS path provides\
    \ an efficient and straightforward way of\n   suppressing routing loops and eliminates\
    \ the \"count-to-infinity\"\n   problem associated with some distance vector algorithms,\
    \ BGP imposes\n   no topological restrictions on the interconnection of AS's.\n"

  - "3. BGP in the Internet\n   3.1 Topology Considerations\n   The overall Internet\
    \ topology may be viewed as an arbitrary\n   interconnection of transit, multihomed,\
    \ and stub AS's.  In order to\n   minimize the impact on the current Internet\
    \ infrastructure, stub and\n   multihomed AS's need not use BGP.  These AS's may\
    \ run other protocols\n   (e.g., EGP) to exchange reachability information with\
    \ transit AS's.\n   Transit AS's using BGP will tag this information as having\
    \ been\n   learned by some method other than BGP. The fact that BGP need not run\n\
    \   on stub or multihomed AS's has no negative impact on the overall\n   quality\
    \ of inter-AS routing for traffic not local to the stub or\n   multihomed AS's\
    \ in question.\n   However, it is recommended that BGP may be used for stub and\n\
    \   multihomed AS's as well, providing an advantage in bandwidth and\n   performance\
    \ over some of the currently used protocols (such as EGP).\n   In addition, this\
    \ would result in less need for the use of defaults\n   and in better choices\
    \ of Inter-AS routes for multihomed AS's.\n"

- title: 3.3 BGP Neighbor Relationships
  contents:
  - "3.3 BGP Neighbor Relationships\n   The Internet is viewed as a set of arbitrarily\
    \ connected AS's. BGP\n   speakers in each AS communicate with each other to exchange\
    \ network\n   reachability information based on a set of policies established\n\
    \   within each AS. Routers that communicate directly with each other via\n  \
    \ BGP are known as BGP neighbors. BGP neighbors can be located within\n   the\
    \ same AS or in different AS's. For the sake of discussion, BGP\n   communications\
    \ with neighbors in different AS's will be referred to\n   as External BGP, and\
    \ with neighbors in the same AS as Internal BGP.\n   There can be as many BGP\
    \ speakers as deemed necessary within an AS.\n   Usually, if an AS has multiple\
    \ connections to other AS's, multiple\n   BGP speakers are needed. All BGP speakers\
    \ representing the same AS\n   must give a consistent image of the AS to the outside.\
    \ This requires\n   that the BGP speakers have consistent routing information\
    \ among them.\n   These gateways can communicate with each other via BGP or by\
    \ other\n   means. The policy constraints applied to all BGP speakers within an\n\
    \   AS must be consistent. Techniques such as using tagged IGP (see\n   A.2.2)\
    \ may be employed to detect possible inconsistencies.\n   In the case of External\
    \ BGP, the BGP neighbors must belong to\n   different AS's, but share a common\
    \ network. This common network\n   should be used to carry the BGP messages between\
    \ them. The use of BGP\n   across an intervening AS invalidates the AS path information.\
    \ An\n   Autonomous System number must be used with BGP to specify which\n   Autonomous\
    \ System the BGP speaker belongs to.\n"
- title: 4. Policy Making with BGP
  contents:
  - "4. Policy Making with BGP\n   BGP provides the capability for enforcing policies\
    \ based on various\n   routing preferences and constraints. Policies are not directly\n\
    \   encoded in the protocol. Rather, policies are provided to BGP in the\n   form\
    \ of configuration information.\n   BGP enforces policies by affecting the selection\
    \ of paths from\n   multiple alternatives, and by controlling the redistribution\
    \ of\n   routing information.  Policies are determined by the AS\n   administration.\n\
    \   Routing policies are related to political, security, or economic\n   considerations.\
    \ For example, if an AS is unwilling to carry traffic\n   to another AS, it can\
    \ enforce a policy prohibiting this. The\n   following are examples of routing\
    \ policies that can be enforced with\n   the use of BGP:\n      1. A multihomed\
    \ AS can refuse to act as a transit AS for other\n         AS's.  (It does so\
    \ by not advertising routes to networks other\n         than those directly connected\
    \ to it.)\n      2. A multihomed AS can become a transit AS for a restricted set\
    \ of\n         adjacent AS's, i.e., some, but not all, AS's can use multihomed\n\
    \         AS as a transit AS. (It does so by advertising its routing\n       \
    \  information to this set of AS's.)\n      3. An AS can favor or disfavor the\
    \ use of certain AS's for\n         carrying transit traffic from itself.\n  \
    \ A number of performance-related criteria can be controlled with the\n   use\
    \ of BGP:\n      1. An AS can minimize the number of transit AS's. (Shorter AS\n\
    \         paths can be preferred over longer ones.)\n      2. The quality of transit\
    \ AS's. If an AS determines that two or\n         more AS paths can be used to\
    \ reach a given destination, that\n         AS can use a variety of means to decide\
    \ which of the candidate\n         AS paths it will use. The quality of an AS\
    \ can be measured by\n         such things as diameter, link speed, capacity,\
    \ tendency to\n         become congested, and quality of operation. Information\
    \ about\n         these qualities might be determined by means other than BGP.\n\
    \      3. Preference of internal routes over external routes.\n   For consistency\
    \ within an AS, equal cost paths, resulting from\n   combinations of policies\
    \ and/or normal route selection procedures,\n   must be resolved in a consistent\
    \ fashion.\n   Fundamental to BGP is the rule that an AS advertises to its\n \
    \  neighboring AS's only those routes that it uses. This rule reflects\n   the\
    \ \"hop-by-hop\" routing paradigm generally used by the current\n   Internet.\n"
- title: 5. Path Selection with BGP
  contents:
  - "5. Path Selection with BGP\n   One of the major tasks of a BGP speaker is to\
    \ evaluate different\n   paths to a destination network from its border gateways\
    \ at that\n   connection, select the best one, apply applicable policy constraints,\n\
    \   and then advertise it to all of its BGP neighbors at that same\n   connection.\
    \ The key issue is how different paths are evaluated and\n   compared.\n   In\
    \ traditional distance vector protocols (e.g., RIP) there is only\n   one metric\
    \ (e.g., hop count) associated with a path. As such,\n   comparison of different\
    \ paths is reduced to simply comparing two\n   numbers. A complication in Inter-AS\
    \ routing arises from the lack of a\n   universally agreed-upon metric among AS's\
    \ that can be used to\n   evaluate external paths. Rather, each AS may have its\
    \ own set of\n   criteria for path evaluation.\n   A BGP speaker builds a routing\
    \ database consisting of the set of all\n   feasible paths and the list of networks\
    \ reachable through each path.\n   For purposes of precise discussion, it's useful\
    \ to consider the set\n   of feasible paths for a given destination network. In\
    \ most cases, we\n   would expect to find only one feasible path. However, when\
    \ this is\n   not the case, all feasible paths should be maintained, and their\n\
    \   maintenance speeds adaptation to the loss of the primary path. Only\n   the\
    \ primary path at any given time will ever be advertised.\n   The path selection\
    \ process can be formalized by defining a partial\n   order over the set of all\
    \ feasible paths to a given destination\n   network. One way to define this partial\
    \ order is to define a function\n   that maps each full AS path to a non-negative\
    \ integer that denotes\n   the path's degree of preference. Path selection is\
    \ then reduced to\n   applying this function to all feasible paths and choosing\
    \ the one\n   with the highest degree of preference.\n   In actual BGP implementations,\
    \ criteria for assigning degree of\n   preferences to a path are specified in\
    \ configuration information.\n   The process of assigning a degree of preference\
    \ to a path can be\n   based on several sources of information:\n      1. Information\
    \ explicitly present in the full AS path.\n      2. A combination of information\
    \ that can be derived from the full\n         AS path and information outside\
    \ the scope of BGP (e.g., policy\n         routing constraints provided at configuration).\n\
    \   Possible criteria for assigning a degree of preference to a path are:\n  \
    \    - AS count. Paths with a smaller AS count are generally better.\n      -\
    \ Policy consideration. BGP supports policy-based routing based\n        on the\
    \ controlled distribution of routing information.  A BGP\n        speaker may\
    \ be aware of some policy constraints (both within\n        and outside of its\
    \ own AS) and do appropriate path selection.\n        Paths that do not comply\
    \ with policy requirements are not\n        considered further.\n      - Presence\
    \ or absence of a certain AS or AS's in the path. By\n        means of information\
    \ outside the scope of BGP, an AS may know\n        some performance characteristics\
    \ (e.g., bandwidth, MTU, intra-AS\n        diameter) of certain AS's and may try\
    \ to avoid or prefer them.\n      - Path origin. A path learned entirely from\
    \ BGP (i.e., whose\n        endpoint is internal to the last AS on the path is\
    \ generally\n        better than one for which part of the path was learned via\
    \ EGP\n        or some other means.\n      - AS path subsets. An AS path that\
    \ is a subset of a longer AS\n        path to the same destination should be preferred\
    \ over the longer\n        path.  Any problem in the shorter path (such as an\
    \ outage) will\n        also be a problem in the longer path.\n      - Link dynamics.\
    \ Stable paths should be preferred over unstable\n        ones. Note that this\
    \ criterion must be used in a very careful\n        way to avoid causing unnecessary\
    \ route fluctuation. Generally,\n        any criteria that depend on dynamic information\
    \ might cause\n        routing instability and should be treated very carefully.\n"

  - "6. Required set of supported routing policies.\n   Policies are provided to BGP\
    \ in the form of configuration\n   information.  This information is not directly\
    \ encoded in the\n   protocol. Therefore, BGP can provides support for quite complex\n\
    \   routing policies. However, it is not required for all BGP\n   implementations\
    \ to support such policies.\n   We are not attempting to standardize the routing\
    \ policies that must\n   be supported in every BGP implementation, we strongly\
    \ encourage all\n   implementors to support the following set of routing policies:\n\
    \      1. BGP implementations should allow an AS to control announcements\n  \
    \       of BGP-learned routes to adjacent AS's.  Implementations should\n    \
    \     also support such control with at least the granularity of\n         a single\
    \ network.  Implementations should also support such\n         control with the\
    \ granularity of an autonomous system, where\n         the autonomous system may\
    \ be either the autonomous system that\n         originated the route, or the\
    \ autonomous system that advertised\n         the route to the local system (adjacent\
    \ autonomous system).\n      2. BGP implementations should allow an AS to prefer\
    \ a particular\n         path to a destination (when more than one path is available).\n\
    \         This function should be implemented by allowing system\n         administrators\
    \ to assign \"weights\" to AS's, and making route\n         selection process\
    \ to select a route with the lowest \"weight\"\n         (where \"weight\" of\
    \ a route is defined as a sum of \"weights\" of\n         all AS's in the AS_PATH\
    \ path attribute associated with that\n         route).\n      3. BGP implementations\
    \ should allow an AS to ignore routes with\n         certain AS's in the AS_PATH\
    \ path attribute.  Such function can\n         be implemented by using technique\
    \ outlined in (2), and by\n         assigning \"infinity\" as \"weights\" for\
    \ such AS's. The route\n         selection process must ignore routes that have\

- title: Overview
  contents:
  - "Overview\n   By definition, all transit AS's must be able to carry traffic which\n\
    \   originates from and/or is destined to locations outside of that AS.\n   This\
    \ requires a certain degree of interaction and coordination\n   between BGP and\
    \ the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) used by that\n   particular AS. In general,\
    \ traffic originating outside of a given AS\n   is going to pass through both\
    \ interior gateways (gateways that\n   support the IGP only) and border gateways\
    \ (gateways that support both\n   the IGP and BGP). All interior gateways receive\
    \ information about\n   external routes from one or more of the border gateways\
    \ of the AS via\n   the IGP.\n   Depending on the mechanism used to propagate\
    \ BGP information within a\n   given AS, special care must be taken to ensure\
    \ consistency between\n   BGP and the IGP, since changes in state are likely to\
    \ propagate at\n   different rates across the AS. There may be a time window between\
    \ the\n   moment when some border gateway (A) receives new BGP routing\n   information\
    \ which was originated from another border gateway (B)\n   within the same AS,\
    \ and the moment the IGP within this AS is capable\n   of routing transit traffic\
    \ to that border gateway (B). During that\n   time window, either incorrect routing\
    \ or \"black holes\" can occur.\n   In order to minimize such routing problems,\
    \ border gateway (A) should\n   not advertise a route to some exterior network\
    \ X via border gateway\n   (B) to all of its BGP neighbors in other AS's until\
    \ all the interior\n   gateways within the AS are ready to route traffic destined\
    \ to X via\n   the correct exit border gateway (B). In other words, interior routing\n\
    \   should converge on the proper exit gateway before/advertising routes\n   via\

    \ own mechanism for carrying BGP information\n   within an AS, one can also use\
    \ an IGP to transport this information,\n   as long as the IGP supports complete\
    \ flooding of routing information\n   (providing the mechanism to distribute the\
    \ BGP information) and\n   onepass convergence (making the mechanism effectively\
    \ atomic). If an\n   IGP is used to carry BGP information, then the period of\n\
    \   desynchronization described earlier does not occur at all, since BGP\n   information\
    \ propagates within the AS synchronously with the IGP, and\n   the IGP converges\
    \ more or less simultaneously with the arrival of the\n   new routing information.\
    \ Note that the IGP only carries BGP\n   information and should not interpret\
    \ or process this information.\n"

  - "A.2.2  Tagged Interior Gateway Protocol\n   Certain IGPs can tag routes exterior\
    \ to an AS with the identity of\n   their exit points while propagating them within\
    \ the AS. Each border\n   gateway should use identical tags for announcing exterior\
    \ routing\n   information (received via BGP) both into the IGP and into Internal\n\
    \   BGP when propagating this information to other border gateways within\n  \
    \ the same AS. Tags generated by a border gateway must uniquely\n   identify that\
    \ particular border gateway--different border gateways\n   must use different\
    \ tags.\n   All Border Gateways within a single AS must observe the following\
    \ two\n   rules:\n      1. Information received via Internal BGP by a border gateway\
    \ A\n         declaring a network to be unreachable must immediately be\n    \
    \     propagated to all of the External BGP neighbors of A.\n      2. Information\
    \ received via Internal BGP by a border gateway A\n         about a reachable\
    \ network X cannot be propagated to any of\n         the External BGP neighbors\
    \ of A unless/until A has an IGP\n         route to X and both the IGP and the\
    \ BGP routing information\n         have identical tags.\n   These rules guarantee\
    \ that no routing information is announced\n   externally unless the IGP is capable\
    \ of correctly supporting it. It\n   also avoids some causes of \"black holes\"\
    .\n   One possible method for tagging BGP and IGP routes within an AS is to\n\
    \   use the IP address of the exit border gateway announcing the exterior\n  \
    \ route into the AS. In this case the \"gateway\" field in the BGP UPDATE\n  \
    \ message is used as the tag.\n"
- title: A.2.3 Encapsulation
  contents:
  - "A.2.3 Encapsulation\n   Encapsulation provides the simplest (in terms of the\
    \ interaction\n   between the IGP and BGP) mechanism for carrying transit traffic\n\
    \   across the AS. In this approach, transit traffic is encapsulated\n   within\
    \ an IP datagram addressed to the exit gateway. The only\n   requirement imposed\
    \ on the IGP by this approach is that it should be\n   capable of supporting routing\
    \ between border gateways within the same\n   AS.\n   The address of the exit\
    \ gateway A for some exterior network X is\n   specified in the BGP identifier\
    \ field of the BGP OPEN message\n   received from gateway A via Internal BGP by\
    \ all other border gateways\n   within the same AS. In order to route traffic\
    \ to network X, each\n   border gateway within the AS encapsulates it in datagrams\
    \ addressed\n   to gateway A. Gateway A then performs decapsulation and forwards\
    \ the\n   original packet to the proper gateway in another AS\n   Since encapsulation\
    \ does not rely on the IGP to carry exterior\n   routing information, no synchronization\
    \ between BGP and the IGP is\n   required.\n   Some means of identifying datagrams\
    \ containing encapsulated IP, such\n   as an IP protocol type code, must be defined\
    \ if this method is to be\n   used.\n   Note, that if a packet to be encapsulated\
    \ has length that is very\n   close to the MTU, that packet would be fragmented\
    \ at the gateway that\n   performs encapsulation.\n"
- title: A.2.4  Other Cases
  contents:
  - "A.2.4  Other Cases\n   There may be AS's with IGPs which can neither carry BGP\
    \ information\n   nor tag exterior routes (e.g., RIP). In addition, encapsulation\
    \ may\n   be either infeasible or undesirable. In such situations, the\n   following\
    \ two rules must be observed:\n      1. Information received via Internal BGP\
    \ by a border gateway A\n         declaring a network to be unreachable must immediately\
    \ be\n         propagated to all of the External BGP neighbors of A.\n      2.\
    \ Information received via Internal BGP by a border gateway A\n         about\
    \ a reachable network X cannot be propagated to any of\n         the External\
    \ BGP neighbors of A unless A has an IGP route to\n         X and sufficient time\
    \ (holddown) has passed for the IGP routes\n         to have converged.\n   The\
    \ above rules present necessary (but not sufficient) conditions for\n   propagating\
    \ BGP routing information to other AS's. In contrast to\n   tagged IGPs, these\
    \ rules cannot ensure that interior routes to the\n   proper exit gateways are\
    \ in place before propagating the routes other\n   AS's.\n   If the convergence\
    \ time of an IGP is less than some small value X,\n   then the time window during\
    \ which the IGP and BGP are unsynchronized\n   is less than X as well, and the\
    \ whole issue can be ignored at the\n   cost of transient periods (of less than\
    \ length X) of routing\n   instability. A reasonable value for X is a matter for\
    \ further study,\n   but X should probably be less than one second.\n   If the\
    \ convergence time of an IGP cannot be ignored, a different\n   approach is needed.\
    \ Mechanisms and techniques which might be\n   appropriate in this situation are\
    \ subjects for further study.\n"
