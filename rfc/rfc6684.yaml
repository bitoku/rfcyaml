- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In the five years since the specification of IODEF [RFC5070],\
    \ the\n   threat environment has evolved, as has the practice of cooperative\n\
    \   network defense.  These trends, along with experience gained through\n   implementation\
    \ and deployment, have indicated the need to extend\n   IODEF.  This document\
    \ provides guidelines for defining these\n   extensions.  It starts by describing\
    \ the applicability of IODEF\n   extensions, and the IODEF extension mechanisms,\
    \ before providing a\n   section (Appendix A) that contains a template to be the\
    \ starting\n   point for any future Internet-Draft about an IODEF extension.\n\
    \   This document is designed to give guidance on the extension of IODEF,\n  \
    \ especially for those extension authors who may be new to the IETF\n   process.\
    \  Nothing in this document should be construed as defining\n   policies for the\
    \ definition of these extensions.\n   At publication time, the Managed Incident\
    \ Lightweight Exchange (MILE)\n   working group of the IETF provides a home for\
    \ work on IODEF\n   extensions that do not otherwise have a natural home.  IODEF\n\
    \   extensions that require the expertise of other IETF working groups or\n  \
    \ other standards development organizations may be done within those\n   groups\
    \ with consultation of IODEF experts, such as those appointed\n   for review as\
    \ in [RFC6685].\n"
- title: 2.  Applicability of Extensions to IODEF
  contents:
  - "2.  Applicability of Extensions to IODEF\n   Before deciding to extend IODEF,\
    \ the first step is to determine\n   whether an IODEF extension is a good fit\
    \ for a given problem.  There\n   are two sides to this question:\n   1.  Does\
    \ the problem involve the reporting or sharing of\n       observations, indications,\
    \ or other information about an\n       incident, whether in progress or completed,\
    \ hypothetical or real?\n       \"Incident\" is defined in the terminology for\
    \ the original IODEF\n       requirements [RFC3067]: an event that involves a\
    \ security\n       violation, whether a single attack of a group thereof.  If\
    \ the\n       answer to this question is unequivocally \"No\", then IODEF is\n\
    \       probably not a good choice as a base technology for the\n       application\
    \ area.\n   2.  Can IODEF adequately represent information about the incident\n\
    \       without extension?  IODEF has a rich set of incident-relevant\n      \
    \ classes.  If, after detailed examination of the problem area and\n       the\
    \ IODEF specification, and consultation with IODEF experts, the\n       answer\
    \ to this question is \"Yes\", then extension is not\n       necessary.\n   Examples\
    \ of such extensions to IODEF might include the following:\n   o  Leveraging existing\
    \ work in describing aspects of incidents to\n      make IODEF more expressive,\
    \ by standardized reference to external\n      information bases about incidents\
    \ and incident-related information\n   o  Allowing the description of new types\
    \ of entities (e.g., related\n      actors) or new types of characteristics of\
    \ entities (e.g.,\n      information related to financial services) involved in\
    \ an IODEF\n      incident report\n   o  Allowing the representation of new types\
    \ of indicators,\n      observables, or incidents in an IODEF incident report\n\
    \   o  Allowing additional semantic or metadata labeling of IODEF\n      Documents\
    \ (e.g., for handling or disposition instructions, or\n      compliance with data\
    \ protection and data retention regulations)\n"
- title: 3.  Selecting a Mechanism for IODEF Extension
  contents:
  - "3.  Selecting a Mechanism for IODEF Extension\n   IODEF was designed to be extended\
    \ through any combination of the\n   following:\n   1.  extending the enumerated\
    \ values of Attributes, per Section 5.1 of\n       [RFC5070];\n   2.  class extension\
    \ through AdditionalData or RecordItem elements,\n       per Section 5.2 of [RFC5070];\
    \ and/or\n   3.  containment of the IODEF Document element within an external\
    \ XML\n       Document, itself containing extension data, as done by Real-time\n\
    \       Inter-network Defense (RID) [RFC6545].\n   Note that in this final case,\
    \ the extension will not be directly\n   interoperable with IODEF implementations,\
    \ and it must \"unwrap\" the\n   IODEF document from its container; nevertheless,\
    \ this may be\n   appropriate for certain use cases involving integration of IODEF\n\
    \   within external schemas.  Extensions using containment of an IODEF\n   Document\
    \ are not further treated in this document, though the\n   document template in\
    \ Appendix A may be of some use in defining them.\n   Certain attributes containing\
    \ enumerated values within certain IODEF\n   elements may be extended.  For an\
    \ attribute named \"foo\", this is\n   achieved by giving the value of \"foo\"\
    \ as \"ext-value\" and adding a new\n   attribute named \"ext-foo\" containing\
    \ the extended value.  The\n   attributes that can be extended this way are limited\
    \ to the\n   following, denoted in 'Element@attribute' format, referencing the\n\
    \   section in which they are defined in [RFC5070]:\n      Incident@purpose, Section\
    \ 3.2\n      AdditionalData@dtype, Section 3.6\n      Contact@role, Section 3.7\n\
    \      Contact@type, Section 3.7\n      RegistryHandle@registry, Section 3.7.1\n\
    \      Impact@type, Section 3.10.1\n      TimeImpact@metric, Section 3.10.2\n\
    \      TimeImpact@duration, Section 3.10.2\n      HistoryItem@action, Section\
    \ 3.11.1\n      Expectation@action, Section 3.13\n      System@category, Section\
    \ 3.15\n      Counter@type, Section 3.16.1\n      Counter@duration, Section 3.16.1\n\
    \      Address@category, Section 3.16.2\n      NodeRole@category, Section 3.16.3\n\
    \      RecordPattern@type, Section 3.19.2\n      RecordPattern@offsetunit, Section\
    \ 3.19.2\n      RecordItem@dtype, Section 3.19.3\n   Note that this list is current\
    \ as of publication time; the set of\n   IODEF data types may be extended by future\
    \ specifications that update\n   [RFC5070].\n   An example definition of an attribute\
    \ extension is given in\n   Appendix B.\n   IODEF Documents can contain extended\
    \ scalar or XML data using an\n   AdditionalData element or a RecordItem element.\
    \  Scalar data\n   extensions must set the \"dtype\" attribute of the containing\
    \ element\n   to the data type to reference one of the IODEF data types as\n \
    \  enumerated in Section 2 of [RFC5070], and it should use the \"meaning\"\n \
    \  and \"formatid\" attributes to explain the content of the element.\n   XML\
    \ extensions within an AdditionalData or RecordItem element use a\n   dtype of\
    \ \"xml\", and they should define a schema for the topmost\n   containing element\
    \ within the AdditionalData or RecordItem element.\n   An example definition of\
    \ an element definition is given in\n   Appendix C.\n   When adding elements to\
    \ the AdditionalData section of an IODEF\n   document, an extension's namespace\
    \ and schema should be registered\n   with IANA; see Appendix A.6 for details.\n"

    \              Figure 2: The Test Class\n   The Test class has two attributes:\n\
    \   category:   Required.  ENUM.  The type of test data.  The permitted\n    \
    \  values for this attribute are shown below.  The default value is\n      \"\
    unspecified\".\n      1.  unspecified.  The document contains test data, but no\
    \ further\n          information is available.\n      2.  internal.  The test\
    \ data is intended for the internal use of\n          an implementor, and it should\
    \ not be distributed or used\n          outside the context in which it was generated.\n\
    \      3.  unit.  The test data is intended for unit testing of an\n         \
    \ implementation, and it may be included with the implementation\n          to\
    \ support this as part of the build and deployment process.\n      4.  interoperability.\
    \  The test data is intended for\n          interoperability testing of an implementation,\
    \ and it may be\n          freely shared to support this purpose.\n   generator:\
    \   Optional.  STRING.  A free-form string identifying the\n      person, entity,\
    \ or program that generated the test data.\n"
