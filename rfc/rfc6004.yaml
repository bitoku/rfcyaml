  - "1.  Introduction\n   [MEF6] and [G.8011] provide parallel frameworks for defining\
    \ network-\n   oriented characteristics of Ethernet services in transport networks.\n\
    \   The framework discusses general Ethernet connection characteristics,\n   Ethernet\
    \ User-Network Interfaces (UNIs) and Ethernet Network-Network\n   Interfaces (NNIs).\
    \  Within this framework, [G.8011.1] defines the\n   Ethernet Private Line (EPL)\
    \ service and [G.8011.2] defines the\n   Ethernet Virtual Private Line (EVPL)\
    \ service. [MEF6] covers both\n   service types.  [MEF10.1] defines service parameters\
    \ and [MEF11]\n   provides UNI requirements and framework.\n   [MEF6] and [G.8011]\
    \ are focused on service interfaces and not the\n   underlying technology used\
    \ to support the service.  For example,\n   [G.8011] refers to the defined services\
    \ being transported over one of\n   several possible \"server layers\".  This\
    \ document focuses on the types\n   of switching that may directly support these\
    \ services and provides a\n   method for GMPLS-based control of such switching\
    \ technologies.  This\n   document defines the GMPLS extensions needed to support\
    \ such\n   switching, but does not define the UNI or External NNI (E-NNI)\n  \
    \ reference points.  See [RFC6005] for a description of the UNI\n   reference\
    \ point.  This document makes use of the traffic parameters\n   defined in [RFC6003]\
    \ and the generic extensions defined in [RFC6002].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Overview\n   This document uses a common approach to supporting the switching\n\
    \   corresponding to the Ethernet services defined in [MEF6], [G.8011.1],\n  \
    \ and [G.8011.2].  The approach builds on standard GMPLS mechanisms to\n   deliver\
    \ the required control capabilities.  This document reuses the\n   GMPLS mechanisms\
    \ specified in [RFC3473] and [RFC4974].  The document\n   uses the extensions\
    \ defined in [RFC6002].\n   Two types of connectivity between Ethernet endpoints\
    \ are defined in\n   [MEF6] and [G.8011]: point-to-point (P2P) and multipoint-to-\n\
    \   multipoint (MP2MP). [MEF6] uses the term Ethernet Line (E-line) to\n   refer\
    \ to point-to-point virtual connections, and Ethernet LAN (E-LAN)\n   to refer\
    \ to multipoint-to-multipoint virtual connections.  [G.8011]\n   also identifies\
    \ point-to-multipoint (P2MP) as an area for \"further\n   study\".  Within the\
    \ context of GMPLS, support is defined for point-\n   to-point unidirectional\
    \ and bidirectional Traffic Engineering Label\n   Switched Paths (TE LSPs), see\
    \ [RFC3473], and unidirectional point-to-\n   multipoint TE LSPs, see [RFC4875].\n\
    \   Support for P2P and MP2MP services is defined by [G.8011] and\n   required\
    \ by [MEF11].  Note that while [MEF11] and [G.8011] discuss\n   MP2MP, [G.8011.1]\
    \ and [G.8011.2] only define support for P2P.  There\n   is a clear correspondence\
    \ between E-Line/P2P service and GMPLS P2P TE\n   LSPs, and support for such LSPs\
    \ is included in the scope of this\n   document.  There is no such clear correspondence\
    \ between E-LAN/MP2MP\n   service and GMPLS TE LSPs.  Although, it is possible\
    \ to emulate this\n   service using multiple P2P or P2MP TE LSPs, the definition\
    \ of support\n   for MP2MP service is left for future study and is not addressed\
    \ in\n   this document.\n   [MEF11] defines multiple types of control for UNI\
    \ Ethernet services.\n   In MEF UNI Type 1, services are configured manually.\
    \  In MEF UNI Type\n   2, services may be configured manually or via a link management\n\
    \   interface.  In MEF UNI Type 3, services may be established and\n   managed\
    \ via a signaling interface.  From the MEF perspective, this\n   document, along\
    \ with [RFC6005], is aimed at the network control\n   needed to support the MEF\
    \ UNI Type 3 mode of operation.\n   [G.8011.1], [G.8011.2], and [MEF11], together\
    \ with [MEF10.1], define\n   a set of service attributes that are associated with\
    \ each Ethernet\n   connection.  Some of these attributes are based on the provisioning\n\
    \   of the local physical connection and are not modifiable or selectable\n  \
    \ per connection.  Other attributes are specific to a particular\n   connection\
    \ or must be consistent across the connection.  The approach\n   taken in this\
    \ document to communicate these attributes is to exclude\n   the static class\
    \ of attributes from signaling.  This class of\n   attributes will not be explicitly\
    \ discussed in this document.  The\n   other class of attributes is communicated\
    \ via signaling and will be\n   reviewed in the sections below.  The major attributes\
    \ that will be\n   supported in signaling include:\n      - Endpoint identifiers\n\
    \      - Connection identifiers\n      - Traffic parameters (see [RFC6003])\n\
    \      - Bundling / VLAN IDs map (EVPL only)\n      - VLAN ID Preservation (EVPL\
    \ only)\n   Common procedures used to support Ethernet LSPs are described in\n\
    \   Section 2 of this document.  Procedures related to the signaling of\n   switching\
    \ in support of EPL services are described in Section 3.\n   Procedures related\
    \ to the signaling of switching in support of EVPL\n   services are described\
    \ in Section 4.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Ethernet Endpoint Identification
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Ethernet Endpoint Identification\n   Ethernet endpoint identifiers, as\
    \ they are defined in [G.8011] and\n   [MEF10.1], differ significantly from the\
    \ identifiers used by GMPLS.\n   Specifically, the Ethernet endpoint identifiers\
    \ are character based\n   as opposed to the GMPLS norm of being IP address based.\n\
    \   The approach taken by this document to address this disparity\n   leverages\
    \ the solution used for connection identification, see\n   Section 2.2 and [RFC4974],\
    \ and a new CALL_ATTRIBUTES TLV defined in\n   this document.  The solution makes\
    \ use of the [RFC4974] short Call\n   ID, and supports the Ethernet endpoint identifier\
    \ similar to how\n   [RFC4974] supports the long Call ID.  That is, the SENDER_TEMPLATE\n\
    \   and SESSION objects carry IP addresses and a short Call ID, and long\n   identifiers\
    \ are carried in the CALL_ATTRIBUTES object.  As with the\n   long Call ID, the\
    \ Ethernet endpoint identifier is typically only\n   relevant at the ingress and\
    \ egress nodes.\n   As defined below, the Ethernet endpoint identifier is carried\
    \ in the\n   CALL_ATTRIBUTES object in a new TLV.  The new TLV is referred to\
    \ as\n   the Endpoint ID TLV.  The processing of the Endpoint ID TLV parallels\n\
    \   the processing of the long Call ID in [RFC4974].  This processing\n   requires\
    \ the inclusion of the CALL_ATTRIBUTES object in a Notify\n   message.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  Endpoint ID TLV
  contents:

    \   connections, a Call is only established when one or more LSPs\n   (connections\
    \ in [RFC4974] terms) are needed.  An LSP will always be\n   established within\

- title: 4.  EVPL Service
  contents:
  - "4.  EVPL Service\n   EVPL service is defined within the context of both [G.8011.2]\
    \ and\n   [MEF6].  EVPL service allows for multiple Ethernet connections per\n\
    \   port, each of which supports a specific set of VLAN IDs.  The service\n  \
    \ attributes identify different forms of EVPL services, e.g., bundled\n   or unbundled.\
    \  Independent of the different forms, LSPs supporting\n   EVPL Ethernet type\
    \ switching are signaled using the same mechanisms\n   to communicate the one\
    \ or more VLAN IDs associated with a particular\n   LSP (Ethernet connection).\n\
    \   The relevant [RFC3471] parameter values that MUST be used for EVPL\n   connections\
    \ are:\n      Parameter          Name (Value)       Reference\n      --------------\
    \     -----------------  ------------------\n      Switching Type     EVPL (30)\
    \          [RFC6004]\n      LSP Encoding Type  Ethernet (2)       [RFC3471]\n\
    \      G-PID              Ethernet PHY (33)  [RFC3471][RFC4328]\n   As with EPL,\
    \ the procedures defined in Section 2 and the other\n   procedures defined in\
    \ [RFC3473] for the establishment and management\n   of bidirectional LSPs MUST\
    \ be followed when establishing and\n   controlling LSPs that provide EVPL service\
    \ type Ethernet switching.\n   LSPs that provide EVPL service type Ethernet switching\
    \ MUST use the\n   EVPL Generalized Label Format per Section 4.1, and the Generalized\n\
    \   Channel_Set Label Objects per [RFC6002].  A notable implication of\n   bundled\
    \ EVPL services and carrying multiple VLAN IDs is that a Path\n   message may\
    \ grow to be larger than a single (fragmented or non-\n   fragmented) IP packet.\
    \  The basic approach to solving this is to\n   allow for multiple LSPs which\
    \ are associated with a single Call, see\n   Section 2.2.  The specifics of this\
    \ approach are describe below in\n   Section 4.4.\n"
- title: 4.1.  EVPL Generalized Label Format
  contents:
  - "4.1.  EVPL Generalized Label Format\n   Bundled EVPL services require the use\
    \ of a service-specific label,\n   called the EVPL Generalized Label.  For consistency,\
    \ non-bundled EVPL\n   services also use the same label.\n   The format for the\
    \ Generalized Label (Label Type value 2) used with\n   EVPL services is:\n   \
    \   0                   1\n      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\

    \      Reserved: 4 bits\n         This field is reserved.  It MUST be set to zero\
    \ on transmission\n         and MUST be ignored on receipt.  This field SHOULD\
    \ be passed\n         unmodified by transit nodes.\n      VLAN ID: 12 bits\n \
    \        A VLAN identifier.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Egress VLAN ID Control and VLAN ID Preservation
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Egress VLAN ID Control and VLAN ID Preservation\n   When an EVPL service\
    \ is not configured for both bundling and VLAN ID\n   preservation, [MEF6] allows\
    \ VLAN ID mapping.  In particular, the\n   single VLAN ID used at the incoming\
    \ interface of the ingress may be\n   mapped to a different VLAN ID at the outgoing\
    \ interface at the egress\n   UNI.  Such mapping MUST be requested and signaled\
    \ based on the\n   explicit label control mechanism defined in [RFC3473] and clarified\n\
    \   in [RFC4003].\n   When the explicit label control mechanism is not used, VLAN\
    \ IDs MUST\n   be preserved, i.e., not modified, across an LSP.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Single Call - Single LSP
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Single Call - Single LSP\n   For simplicity in management, a single LSP\
    \ SHOULD be used for each\n   EVPL type LSP whose Path and Resv messages fit within\
    \ a single\n   unfragmented IP packet.  This allows the reuse of all standard\
    \ LSP\n   modification procedures.  Of particular note is the modification of\n\
    \   the VLAN IDs associated with the Ethernet connection.  Specifically,\n   [RFC6002],\
    \ make-before-break procedures SHOULD be used to modify the\n   Channel_Set LABEL\
    \ object.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Single Call - Multiple LSPs
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Single Call - Multiple LSPs\n   Multiple LSPs MAY be used to support an\
    \ EVPL service connection.  All\n   such LSPs MUST be established within the same\
    \ Call and follow Call-\n   related procedures, see Section 2.2.  The primary\
    \ purpose of multiple\n   LSPs is to support the case in which the related objects\
    \ result in a\n   Path message being larger than a single unfragmented IP packet.\n\
    \   When using multiple LSPs, all LSPs associated with the same Call/EVPL\n  \
    \ connection MUST be signaled with the same LSP objects with the\n   exception\
    \ of the SENDER_TEMPLATE, SESSION, and label-related objects.\n   All such LSPs\
    \ SHOULD share resources.  When using multiple LSPs, VLAN\n   IDs MAY be added\
    \ to the EVPL connection using either a new LSP or\n   make-before-break procedures,\
    \ see [RFC3209].  Make-before-break\n   procedures on individual LSPs SHOULD be\
    \ used to remove VLAN IDs.\n   To change other service parameters it is necessary\
    \ to re-signal all\n   LSPs associated with the Call via make-before-break procedures.\n"
