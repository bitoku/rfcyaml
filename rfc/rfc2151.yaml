    \ for individual self-learning, a step-\n   by-step laboratory manual for a course,\
    \ or as the basis for a site's\n   users manual. It is intended as a basic guide\
    \ only and will refer to\n   other sources for more detailed information.\n"
- title: 2. Nomenclature
  contents:
  - "2. Nomenclature\n   The following sections provide descriptions and detailed\
    \ examples of\n   several TCP/IP utilities and applications, including the reproduction\n\
    \   of actual sessions using these utilities (with some extraneous\n   information\
    \ removed). Each section describes a single TCP/IP-based\n   tool, it's application,\
    \ and, in some cases, how it works. The text\n   description is usually followed\
    \ by an actual sample session.\n   The sample dialogues shown below were obtained\
    \ from a variety of\n   software and hardware systems, including AIX running on\
    \ an IBM\n   RS/6000, Linux on an Intel 486, Multinet TCP/IP over VMS on a VAX,\n\
    \   and FTP Software's OnNet (formerly PC/TCP) running on a DOS/Windows\n   PC.\
    \ While the examples below can be used as a guide to using and\n   learning about\
    \ the capabilities of TCP/IP tools, the reader should\n   understand that not\
    \ all of these utilities may be found at all TCP/IP\n   hosts nor in all commercial\
    \ software packages. Furthermore, the user\n   interface for different packages\
    \ will be different and the actual\n   command line may appear differently than\
    \ shown here; this will be\n   particularly true for graphical user interfaces\
    \ running over Windows,\n   X-Windows, OS/2, or Macintosh systems. Windows-based\
    \ sessions are not\n   shown in this RFC because of the desire to have a text\
    \ version of\n   this document; in addition, most GUI-based TCP/IP packages obscure\n\
    \   some of the detail that is essential for understanding what is really\n  \
    \ happening when you click on a button or drag a file. The Internet has\n   many\
    \ exciting things to offer but standardized interfaces to the\n   protocols is\
    \ not yet one of them!  This guide will not provide any\n   detail or motivation\
    \ about the Internet Protocol Suite; more\n   information about the TCP/IP protocols\
    \ and related issues may be\n   found in RFC 1180 [29], Comer [6], Feit [7], Kessler\
    \ [14], and\n   Stevens [30].\n   In the descriptions below, commands are shown\
    \ in a Courier font\n   (Postscript and HTML versions); items appearing in square\
    \ brackets\n   ([]) are optional, the vertical-bar (|) means \"or,\" parameters\n\
    \   appearing with no brackets or within curly brackets ({}) are\n   mandatory,\
    \ and parameter names that need to be replaced with a\n   specific value will\
    \ be shown in italics (Postscript and HTML\n   versions) or within angle brackets\
    \ (<>, text version). In the sample\n   dialogues, user input is in bold (Postscript\
    \ and HTML versions) or\n   denoted with asterisks (**) in the margin (text version).\n"
- title: 3. Finding Information About Internet Hosts and Domains
  contents:
  - "3. Finding Information About Internet Hosts and Domains\n   There are several\
    \ tools that let you learn information about Internet\n   hosts and domains. These\
    \ tools provide the ability for an application\n   or a user to perform host name/address\
    \ reconciliation (NSLOOKUP),\n   determine whether another host is up and available\
    \ (PING), learn\n   about another host's users (Finger), and learn the route that\
    \ packets\n   will take to another host (Traceroute).\n"
- title: 3.1. NSLOOKUP
  contents:
  - "3.1. NSLOOKUP\n   NSLOOKUP is the name server lookup program that comes with\
    \ many\n   TCP/IP software packages. A user can use NSLOOKUP to examine entries\n\
    \   in the Domain Name System (DNS) database that pertain to a particular\n  \
    \ host or domain; one common use is to determine a host system's IP\n   address\
    \ from its name or the host's name from its IP address. The\n   general form of\
    \ the command to make a single query is:\n      nslookup [IP_address|host_name]\n\
    \   If the program is started without any parameters, the user will be\n   prompted\
    \ for input; the user can enter either an IP address or host\n   name at that\
    \ time, and the program will respond with the name and\n   address of the default\
    \ name sever, the name server actually used to\n   resolve each request, and the\
    \ IP address and host name that was\n   queried. Exit is used to quit the NSLOOKUP\
    \ application.\n   Three simple queries are shown in the example below:\n    \
    \  1 Requests the address of the host named www.hill.com, the World\n      Wide\
    \ Web server at Hill Associates. As it turns out, this is not\n      the true\
    \ name of the host, but an alias. The full name of the host\n      and the IP\
    \ address are listed by NSLOOKUP.\n      2 Requests the address of host syrup.hill.com,\
    \ which is the same\n      host as in the first query. Note that NSLOOKUP provides\
    \ a \"non-\n      authoritative\" answer. Since NSLOOKUP just queried this same\n\
    \      address, the information is still in its cache memory. Rather than\n  \
    \    send additional messages to the name server, the answer is one\n      that\
    \ it remembers from before; the server didn't look up the\n      information again,\
    \ however, so it is not guaranteed to still be\n      accurate (because the information\
    \ might have changed within the\n      last few milliseconds!).\n      3 Requests\
    \ the name of the host with the given IP address. The\n      result points to\
    \ the Internet gateway to Australia, munnari.oz.au.\n   One additional query is\
    \ shown in the dialogue below. NSLOOKUP\n   examines information that is stored\
    \ by the DNS. The default NSLOOKUP\n   queries examine basic address records (called\
    \ \"A records\") to\n   reconcile the host name and IP address, although other\
    \ information is\n   also available. In the final query below, for example, the\
    \ user wants\n   to know where electronic mail addressed to the hill.com domain\n\
    \   actually gets delivered, since hill.com is not the true name of an\n   actual\
    \ host. This is accomplished by changing the query type to look\n   for mail exchange\
    \ (MX) records by issuing a set type command (which\n   must be in lower case).\
    \ The query shows that mail addressed to\n   hill.com is actually sent to a mail\
    \ server called mail.hill.com. If\n   that system is not available, mail delivery\
    \ will be attempted to\n   first mailme.hill.com and then to netcomsv.netcom.com;\
    \ the order of\n   these attempts is controlled by the \"preference\" value. This\
    \ query\n   also returns the name of the domain's name servers and all associated\n\
    \   IP addresses.\n   The DNS is beyond the scope of this introduction, although\
    \ more\n   information about the concepts and structure of the DNS can be found\n\
    \   in STD 13/RFC 1034 [19], RFC 1591 [21], and Kessler [16]. The help\n   command\
    \ can be issued at the program prompt for information about\n   NSLOOKUP's more\
    \ advanced commands.\n   TECHNICAL NOTE: There are other tools that might be available\
    \ on your\n   system or with your software for examining the DNS. Alternatives\
    \ to\n   NSLOOKUP include HOST and DIG.\n  ====================================================================\n"

- title: 3.2. Ping
  contents:
  - "3.2. Ping\n   Ping, reportedly an acronym for the Packet Internetwork Groper,\
    \ is\n   one of the most widely available tools bundled with TCP/IP software\n\
    \   packages.  Ping uses a series of Internet Control Message Protocol\n   (ICMP)\
    \ [22] Echo messages to determine if a remote host is active or\n   inactive,\
    \ and to determine the round-trip delay in communicating with\n   it.\n   A common\
    \ form of the Ping command, showing some of the more commonly\n   available options\
    \ that are of use to general users, is:\n      ping [-q] [-v] [-R] [-c Count]\
    \ [-i Wait] [-s PacketSize] Host\n   where:\n         -q          Quiet output;\
    \ nothing is displayed except summary\n         lines at startup and completion\n\
    \         -v          Verbose output, which lists ICMP packets that are\n    \
    \     received in addition to Echo Responses\n         -R          Record route\
    \ option; includes the RECORD_ROUTE\n         option in the Echo Request packet\
    \ and displays the route buffer\n         on returned packets\n         -c Count\
    \    Specifies the number of Echo Requests to be sent\n         before concluding\
    \ test (default is to run until interrupted\n         with a control-C)\n    \
    \     -i Wait     Indicates the number of seconds to wait between\n         sending\
    \ each packet (default = 1)\n         -s PacketSize    Specifies the number of\
    \ data bytes to be sent;\n         the total ICMP packet size will be PacketSize+8\
    \ bytes due to\n         the ICMP header (default = 56, or a 64 byte packet)\n\
    \         Host   IP address or host name of target system\n   In the first example\
    \ below, the user pings the host\n   thumper.bellcore.com, requesting that 6 (-c)\
    \ messages be sent, each\n   containing 64 bytes (-s) of user data. The display\
    \ shows the round-\n   trip delay of each Echo message returned to the sending\
    \ host; at the\n   end of the test, summary statistics are displayed.\n   In the\
    \ second example, the user pings the host smcvax.smcvt.edu,\n   requesting that\
    \ 10 messages be sent in quite mode (-q). In this case,\n   a summary is printed\
    \ at the conclusion of the test and individual\n   responses are not listed.\n\
    \   TECHNICAL NOTE: Older versions of the Ping command, which are still\n   available\
    \ on some systems, had the following general format:\n      ping [-s] {IP_address|host_name}\
    \ [PacketSize] [Count]\n   In this form, the optional \"-s\" string tells the\
    \ system to\n   continually send an ICMP Echo message every second; the optional\n\
    \   PacketSize parameter specifies the number of bytes in the Echo\n   message\
    \ (the message will contain PacketSize-8 bytes of data; the\n   default is 56\
    \ bytes of data and a 64 byte message); and the optional\n   Count parameter indicates\
    \ the number of Echo messages to send before\n   concluding the test (the default\
    \ is to run the test continuously\n   until interrupted).\n  ====================================================================\n"

- title: 3.4. Traceroute
  contents:
  - "3.4. Traceroute\n   Traceroute is another common TCP/IP tool, this one allowing\
    \ users to\n   learn about the route that packets take from their local host to\
    \ a\n   remote host. Although used often by network and system managers as a\n\
    \   simple, yet powerful, debugging tool, traceroute can be used by end\n   users\
    \ to learn something about the ever-changing structure of the\n   Internet.\n\
    \   The classic Traceroute command has the following general format\n   (where\
    \ \"#\" represents a positive integer value associated with the\n   qualifier):\n\
    \     traceroute [-m #] [-q #] [-w #] [-p #] {IP_address|host_name}\n        \
    \ where\n            -m   is the maximum allowable TTL value, measured as\n  \
    \          the number of hops allowed before the program terminates\n        \
    \    (default = 30)\n            -q   is the number of UDP packets that will be\
    \ sent with\n            each time-to-live setting (default = 3)\n           \
    \ -w   is the amount of time, in seconds, to wait for\n            an answer from\
    \ a particular router before giving up\n            (default= 5)\n           \
    \ -p   is the invalid port address at the remote host\n            (default =\
    \ 33434)\n   The Traceroute example below shows the route between a host at St.\n\
    \   Michael's College (domain smcvt.edu) and a host at Hill Associates\n   (www.hill.com),\
    \ both located in Colchester, VT but served by\n   different Internet service\
    \ providers (ISP).\n      1 St. Michael's College is connected to the Internet\
    \ via BBN\n      Planet; since the mid-1980s, BBN operated the NSF's regional\
    \ ISP,\n      called the New England Academic and Research Network (NEARNET),\n\
    \      which was renamed in 1994. The first hop, then, goes to St. Mike's\n  \
    \    BBN Planet gateway router (smc.bbnplanet.net). The next hop goes\n      to\
    \ another BBN Planet router (denoted here only by IP address\n      since a name\
    \ was not assigned to the device), until the packet\n      reaches the BBN Planet\
    \ T3 backbone.\n      2 The packet takes two hops through routers at BBN Planet's\n\
    \      Cambridge (MA) facility and is then forwarded to BBN Planet in New\n  \
    \    York City, where the packet takes four more hops. The packet is\n      then\
    \ forwarded to BBN Planet in College Park (MD).\n      3 The packet is sent to\
    \ BBN Planet's router at MAE-East, MFS\n      Datanet's Network Access Point (NAP)\
    \ in Washington, D.C. MAE\n      stands for Metropolitan Area Exchange, and is\
    \ a Fiber Distributed\n      Data Interface (FDDI) ring interconnecting routers\
    \ from\n      subscribing ISPs. The packet is then forwarded to NETCOM, Hill\n\
    \      Associates' ISP.\n      4 The packet now travels through NETCOM's T3 backbone,\
    \ following\n      links from Washington, D.C. to Chicago to Santa Clara (CA),\
    \ to San\n      Jose (CA).\n      5 The packet is now sent to Hill Associates\
    \ router (again, a\n      system designated only by an IP address since the NETCOM\
    \ side of\n      the router was not named) and then passed to the target system.\n\
    \      Note that the host's real name is not www.hill.com, but\n      syrup.hill.com.\n\
    \   TECHNICAL NOTE: The original version of Traceroute works by sending a\n  \
    \ sequence of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) datagrams to an invalid port\n   address\
    \ at the remote host. Using the default settings, three\n   datagrams are sent,\
    \ each with a Time-To-Live (TTL) field value set to\n   one. The TTL value of\
    \ 1 causes the datagram to \"timeout\" as soon as\n   it hits the first router\
    \ in the path; this router will then respond\n   with an ICMP Time Exceeded Message\
    \ (TEM) indicating that the datagram\n   has expired. Another three UDP messages\
    \ are now sent, each with the\n   TTL value set to 2, which causes the second\
    \ router to return ICMP\n   TEMs. This process continues until the packets actually\
    \ reach the\n   other destination. Since these datagrams are trying to access\
    \ an\n   invalid port at the destination host, ICMP Destination Unreachable\n\
    \   Messages are returned indicating an unreachable port; this event\n   signals\
    \ the Traceroute program that it is finished!  The Traceroute\n   program displays\
    \ the round-trip delay associated with each of the\n   attempts. (Note that some\
    \ current implementations of Traceroute use\n   the Record-Route option in IP\
    \ rather than the method described\n   above.)\n   As an aside, Traceroute did\
    \ not begin life as a general-purpose\n   utility, but as a quick-and-dirty debugging\
    \ aid used to find a\n   routing problem.  The code (complete with comments!)\
    \ is available by\n   anonymous FTP in the file traceroute.tar.Z from the host\n\
    \   ftp.ee.lbl.gov. (See Section 4.2 for a discussion of anonymous FTP.)\n  ====================================================================\n"

- title: 4. The Two Fundamental Tools
  contents:
  - "4. The Two Fundamental Tools\n   The two most basic tools for Internet applications\
    \ are TELNET and the\n   File Transfer Protocol (FTP). TELNET allows a user to\
    \ login to a\n   remote host over a TCP/IP network, while FTP, as the name implies,\n\
    \   allows a user to move files between two TCP/IP hosts. These two\n   utilities\
    \ date back to the very early days of the ARPANET.\n"
- title: 4.1. TELNET
  contents:
  - "4.1. TELNET\n   TELNET [27] is TCP/IP's virtual terminal protocol. Using TELNET,\
    \ a\n   user connected to one host can login to another host, appearing like\n\
    \   a directly-attached terminal at the remote system; this is TCP/IP's\n   definition\
    \ of a virtual terminal. The general form of the TELNET\n   command is:\n    \
    \  telnet [IP_address|host_name] [port]\n   As shown, a TELNET connection is initiated\
    \ when the user enters the\n   telnet command and supplies either a host_name\
    \ or IP_address; if\n   neither are given, TELNET will ask for one once the application\n\
    \   begins.\n   In the example below, a user of a PC uses TELNET to attach to\
    \ the\n   remote host smcvax.smcvt.edu. Once logged in via TELNET, the user can\n\
    \   do anything on the remote host that would be possible if connected\n   via\
    \ a directly-attached terminal or via modem. The commands that are\n   subsequently\
    \ used are those available on the remote system to which\n   the user is attached.\
    \ In the sample dialogue below, the user attached\n   to SMCVAX will use basic\
    \ VAX/VMS commands:\n      o The dir command lists the files having a \"COM\"\
    \ file extension.\n      o The mail command enters the VMS MAIL subsystem; the\
    \ dir command\n      here lists waiting mail.\n      o Ping checks the status\
    \ of another host.\n   When finished, the logout command logs the user off the\
    \ remote host;\n   TELNET automatically closes the connection to the remote host\
    \ and\n   returns control to the local system.\n   It is important to note that\
    \ TELNET is a very powerful tool, one that\n   may provide users with access to\
    \ many Internet utilities and services\n   that might not be otherwise available.\
    \ Many of these features are\n   accessed by specifying a port number with the\
    \ TELNET command, in\n   addition to a host's address, and knowledge of port numbers\
    \ provides\n   another mechanism for users to access information with TELNET.\n\
    \   This guide discusses several TCP/IP and Internet utilities that require\n\
    \   local client software, such as Finger, Whois, Archie, and Gopher. But\n  \
    \ what if your software does not include a needed client?  In some cases,\n  \
    \ TELNET may be used to access a remote client and provide the same\n   functionality.\n\
    \   This is done by specifying a port number with the TELNET command. Just\n \
    \  as TCP/IP hosts have a unique IP address, applications on the host are\n  \
    \ associated with an address, called a port. Finger (see Section 3.3\n   above),\
    \ for example, is associated with the well-known port number 79.\n   In the absence\
    \ of a Finger client, TELNETing to port 79 at a remote host\n   may provide the\
    \ same information. You can finger another host with\n   TELNET by using a command\
    \ like:\n                            telnet host_name 79\n   Other well-known\
    \ TCP port numbers include 25 (Simple Mail Transfer\n   Protocol), 43 (whois),\
    \ 80 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), and 119\n   (Network News Transfer Protocol).\n\
    \   Some services are available on the Internet using TELNET and special\n   port\
    \ numbers. A geographical information database, for example, may\n   be accessed\
    \ by TELNETing to port 3000 at host martini.eecs.umich.edu\n   and current weather\
    \ information is available at port 3000 at host\n   downwind.sprl.umich.edu.\n\

- title: 4.2. FTP
  contents:
  - "4.2. FTP\n   FTP [26] is one of the most useful and powerful TCP/IP utilities\
    \ for\n   the general user. FTP allows users to upload and download files\n  \
    \ between local and remote hosts. Anonymous FTP, in particular, is\n   commonly\
    \ available at file archive sites to allow users to access\n   files without having\
    \ to pre-establish an account at the remote host.\n   TELNET might, in fact, be\
    \ used for this purpose but TELNET gives the\n   user complete access to the remote\
    \ system; FTP limits the user to\n   file transfer activities.\n   The general\
    \ form of the FTP command is:\n         ftp [IP_address|host_name]\n   An FTP\
    \ session can be initiated in several ways. In the example shown\n   below, an\
    \ FTP control connection is initiated to a host (the Defense\n   Data Network's\
    \ Network Information Center) by supplying a host name\n   with the FTP command;\
    \ optionally, the host's IP address in dotted\n   decimal (numeric) form could\
    \ be used. If neither host name nor IP\n   address are supplied in the command\
    \ line, a connection to a host can\n   be initiated by typing open host_name or\
    \ open IP_address once the FTP\n   application has been started.\n   The remote\
    \ host will ask for a username and password. If a bona fide\n   registered user\
    \ of this host supplies a valid username and password,\n   then the user will\
    \ have access to any files and directories to which\n   this username has privilege.\
    \ For anonymous FTP access, the username\n   anonymous is used. Historically,\
    \ the password for the anonymous user\n   (not shown in actual use) has been guest,\
    \ although most systems today\n   ask for the user's Internet e-mail address (and\
    \ several sites attempt\n   to verify that packets are coming from that address\
    \ before allowing\n   the user to login).\n   The \"help ?\" command may be used\
    \ to obtain a list of FTP commands and\n   help topics available with your software;\
    \ although not always shown,\n   nearly all TCP/IP applications have a help command.\
    \ An example of the\n   help for FTP's type command is shown in the sample dialogue.\
    \ This\n   command is very important one, by the way; if transferring a binary\n\
    \   or executable file, be sure to set the type to image (or binary on\n   some\
    \ systems).\n   The dir command provides a directory listing of the files in the\n\
    \   current directory at the remote host; the UNIX ls command may also\n   usually\
    \ be used. Note that an FTP data transfer connection is\n   established for the\
    \ transfer of the directory information to the\n   local host. The output from\
    \ the dir command will show a file listing\n   that is consistent with the native\
    \ operating system of the remote\n   host. Although the TCP/IP suite is often\
    \ associated with UNIX, it can\n   (and does) run with nearly all common operating\
    \ systems. The\n   directory information shown in the sample dialogue happens\
    \ to be in\n   UNIX format and includes the following information:\n      o File\
    \ attributes. The first character identifies the type of file\n      entry as\
    \ a directory (d), link or symbolic name (l), or individual\n      file (-). The\
    \ next nine characters are the file access permissions\n      list; the first\
    \ three characters are for the owner, the next three\n      for the owner's group,\
    \ and the last three for all other users.\n      Three access privileges may be\
    \ assigned to each file for each of\n      these roups: read (r), write (w), and\
    \ execute (x).\n      o Number of entries, or hard links, in this structure. This\
    \ value\n      will be a \"1\" if the entry refers to a file or link, or will\
    \ be\n      the number of files in the listed directory.\n      o File owner\n\
    \      o File owner's group.\n      o File size, in bytes.\n      o Date and time\
    \ of last modification. If the date is followed by a\n      timestamp, then the\
    \ date is from the current year.\n      o File name.\n   After the directory information\
    \ has been transferred, FTP closes the\n   data transfer connection.\n   The command\
    \ cd is used to change to another working directory, in\n   this case the rfc\
    \ directory (note that file and directory names may\n   be case-sensitive). As\
    \ in DOS, \"cd ..\" will change to the parent of\n   the current directory. The\
    \ CWD command successful is the only\n   indication that the user's cd command\
    \ was correctly executed; the\n   show-directory (may be truncated to fewer characters,\
    \ as shown)\n   command, if available, may be used to see which working directory\
    \ you\n   are in.\n   Another dir command is used to find all files with the name\n\
    \   rfc173*.txt; note the use of the * wildcard character. We can now\n   copy\
    \ (download) the file of choice (RFC 1739 is the previous version\n   of this\
    \ primer) by using the get (or receive) command, which has the\n   following general\
    \ format:\n      get remote_file_name local_file_name\n   FTP opens another data\
    \ transfer connection for this file transfer\n   purpose; note that the effective\
    \ data transfer rate is 93.664 kbps.\n   FTP's put (or send) command allows uploading\
    \ from the local host to\n   the remote. Put is often not available when using\
    \ anonymous FTP.\n   Finally, we terminate the FTP connection by using the close\
    \ command.\n   The user can initiate another FTP connection using the open command\n\
    \   or can leave FTP by issuing a quit command. Quit can also be used to\n   close\
    \ a connection and terminate a session.\n   TECHNICAL NOTE: It is important to\
    \ note that different FTP packages\n   have different commands available and even\
    \ those with similar names\n   may act differently. In the example shown here\
    \ (using MultiNet for\n   VMS), the show command will display the current working\
    \ directory; in\n   FTP Software's OnNet, show will display a file from the remote\
    \ host\n   at the local host. Some packages have nothing equivalent to either\
    \ of\n   these commands.\n  ====================================================================\n"

    \ not a science.\n   Although there is a distributed database listing all of the\
    \ 16+\n   million hosts on the Internet, no similar database yet exists for the\n\
    \   tens of millions of users. While many commercial ISPs provide\n   directories\

- title: 5.1. WHOIS/NICNAME
  contents:
  - "5.1. WHOIS/NICNAME\n   WHOIS and NICNAME are TCP/IP applications that search\
    \ databases to\n   find the name of network and system administrators, RFC authors,\n\
    \   system and network points-of-contact, and other individuals who are\n   registered\
    \ in appropriate databases. The original NICNAME/WHOIS\n   protocol is described\
    \ in RFC 954 [10].\n   WHOIS may be accessed by TELNETing to an appropriate WHOIS\
    \ server and\n   logging in as whois (no password is required); the most common\n\
    \   Internet name server is located at the Internet Network Information\n   Center\
    \ (InterNIC) at rs.internic.net. This specific database only\n   contains INTERNET\
    \ domains, IP network numbers, and domain points of\n   contact; policies governing\
    \ the InterNIC database are described in\n   RFC 1400 [31].  The MILNET database\
    \ resides at nic.ddn.mil and PSI's\n   White Pages pilot service is located at\
    \ psi.com.\n   Many software packages contain a WHOIS/NICNAME client that\n  \
    \ automatically establishes the TELNET connection to a default name\n   server\
    \ database, although users can usually specify any name server\n   database that\
    \ they want.\n   The accompanying dialogues shows several types of WHOIS/NICNAME\n\
    \   information queries. In the session below, we request information\n   about\
    \ an individual (Denis Stratford) by using WHOIS locally, a\n   specific domain\
    \ (hill.com) by using NICNAME locally, and a network\n   address (199.182.20.0)\
    \ and high-level domain (com) using TELNET to a\n   WHOIS server.\n  ====================================================================\n"

    \ But as\n   the Internet user population shifted from hard-core computer\n  \

- title: 6.1. Archie
  contents:
  - "6.1. Archie\n   Archie, developed in 1992 at the Computer Science Department\
    \ at\n   McGill University in Montreal, allows users to find software, data,\n\
    \   and other information files that reside at anonymous FTP archive\n   sites;\
    \ the name of the program, reportedly, is derived from the word\n   \"archive\"\
    \ and not from the comic book character. Archie tracks the\n   contents of several\
    \ thousand anonymous FTP sites containing millions\n   of files. The archie server\
    \ automatically updates the information\n   from each registered site about once\
    \ a month, providing relatively\n   up-to-date information without unduly stressing\
    \ the network. Archie,\n   however, is not as popular as it once was and many\
    \ sites have not\n   updated their information; as the examples below show, many\
    \ of the\n   catalog listings are several years old.\n   Before using archie,\
    \ you must identify a server address. The sites\n   below all support archie;\
    \ most (but not all) archie sites support the\n   servers command which lists\
    \ all known archie servers. Due to the\n   popularity of archie at some sites\
    \ and its high processing demands,\n   many sites limit access to non-peak hours\
    \ and/or limit the number of\n   simultaneous archie users. Available archie sites\
    \ include:\n     archie.au                       archie.rediris.es\n     archie.edvz.uni-linz.ac.at\
    \      archie.luth.se\n     archie.univie.ac.at             archie.switch.ch\n\
    \     archie.uqam.ca                  archie.ncu.edu.tw\n     archie.funet.fi\
    \                 archie.doc.ic.ac.uk\n     archie.th-darmstadt.de          archie.unl.edu\n\
    \     archie.ac.il                    archie.internic.net\n     archie.unipi.it\
    \                 archie.rutgers.edu\n     archie.wide.ad.jp               archie.ans.net\n\
    \     archie.kr                       archie.sura.net\n     archie.sogang.ac.kr\n\
    \   All archie sites can be accessed using archie client software. Some\n   archie\
    \ servers may be accessed using TELNET; when TELNETing to an\n   archie site,\
    \ login as archie (you must use lower case) and hit\n   <ENTER> if a password\
    \ is requested.\n   Once connected, the help command assists users in obtaining\
    \ more\n   information about using archie. Two more useful archie commands are\n\
    \   prog, used to search for files in the database, and whatis, which\n   searches\
    \ for keywords in the program descriptions.\n   In the accompanying dialogue,\
    \ the set maxhits command is used to\n   limit the number of responses to any\
    \ following prog commands; if this\n   is not done, the user may get an enormous\
    \ amount of information.  In\n   this example, the user issues a request to find\
    \ entries related to\n   \"dilbert\"; armed with this information, a user can\
    \ use anonymous FTP\n   to examine these directories and files.\n   The next request\
    \ is for files with \"tcp/ip\" as a keyword descriptor.\n   These responses can\
    \ be used for subsequent prog commands.\n   Exit archie using the exit command.\
    \ At this point, TELNET closes the\n   connection and control returns to the local\
    \ host.\n   Additional information about archie can be obtained by sending e-mail\n\
    \   to Bunyip Information Systems (archie-info@bunyip.com). Client\n   software\
    \ is not required to use archie, but can make life a little\n   easier; some such\
    \ software can be downloaded using anonymous FTP from\n   the /pub/archie/clients/\
    \ directory at ftp.sura.net (note that the\n   newest program in this directory\
    \ is dated June 1994). Most shareware\n   and commercial archie clients hide the\
    \ complexity described in this\n   section; users usually connect to a pre-configured\
    \ archie server\n   merely by typing an archie command line.\n  ====================================================================\n"

- title: 6.2. Gopher
  contents:
  - "6.2. Gopher\n   The Internet Gopher protocol was developed at the University\
    \ of\n   Minnesota's Microcomputer Center in 1991, as a distributed\n   information\
    \ search and retrieval tool for the Internet. Gopher is\n   described in RFC 1436\
    \ [1]; the name derives from the University's\n   mascot.\n   Gopher provides\
    \ a tool so that publicly available information at a\n   host can be organized\
    \ in a hierarchical fashion using simple text\n   descriptions, allowing files\
    \ to be perused using a simple menu\n   system.  Gopher also allows a user to\
    \ view a file on demand without\n   requiring additional file transfer protocols.\
    \ In addition, Gopher\n   introduced the capability of linking sites on the Internet,\
    \ so that\n   each Gopher site can be used as a stepping stone to access other\n\
    \   sites and reducing the amount of duplicate information and effort on\n   the\
    \ network.\n   Any Gopher site can be accessed using Gopher client software (or\
    \ a\n   WWW browser). In many cases, users can access Gopher by TELNETing to\n\
    \   a valid Gopher location; if the site provides a remote Gopher client,\n  \
    \ the user will see a text-based, menu interface. The number of Gopher\n   sites\
    \ grew rapidly between 1991 and 1994, although growth tapered due\n   to the introduction\
    \ of the Web; in any case, most Gopher sites have a\n   menu item that will allow\
    \ you to identify other Gopher sites. If\n   using TELNET, login with the username\
    \ gopher (this must be in\n   lowercase); no password is required.\n   In the\
    \ sample dialogue below, the user attaches to the Gopher server\n   at the Internet\
    \ Network Information Center (InterNIC) by TELNETing to\n   ds.internic.net. With\
    \ the menu interface shown here, the user merely\n   follows the prompts. Initially,\
    \ the main menu will appear. Selecting\n   item 3 causes Gopher to seize and display\
    \ the \"InterNIC Registration\n   Services (NSI)\" menu; move to the desired menu\
    \ item by typing the\n   item number or by moving the pointer (-->) down to the\
    \ desired entry\n   using the DOWN-ARROW key on the keyboard, and then hitting\
    \ ENTER. To\n   quit the program at any time, press q (quit); ? and u will provide\n\
    \   help or go back up to the previous menu, respectively. Users may also\n  \
    \ search for strings within files using the / command or download the\n   file\
    \ being interrogated using the D command.\n   Menu item 1 within the first submenu\
    \ (selected in the dialogue shown\n   here) is titled \"InterNIC Registration\
    \ Archives.\" As its submenu\n   implies, this is a place to obtain files containing\
    \ the InterNIC's\n   domain registration policies, domain data, registration forms,\
    \ and\n   other information related to registering names and domains on the\n\
    \   Internet.\n  ====================================================================\n"

  contents:
  - "6.3. VERONICA, JUGHEAD, and WAIS\n   The problem with being blessed with so much\
    \ information from FTP,\n   archie, Gopher, and other sources is exactly that\
    \ -- too much\n   information. To make it easier for users to locate the system\
    \ on\n   which their desired information resides, a number of other tools have\n\
    \   been created.\n   VERONICA (Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to Computerized\n\
    \   Archives) was developed at the University of Nevada at Reno as an\n   archie-\
    \ like adjunct to Gopher. As the number of Gopher sites quickly\n   grew after\
    \ its introduction, it became increasingly harder to find\n   information in gopherspace\
    \ since Gopher was designed to search a\n   single database at a time. VERONICA\
    \ maintains an index of titles of\n   Gopher items and performs a keyword search\
    \ on all of the Gopher sites\n   that it has knowledge of and access to, obviating\
    \ the need for the\n   user to perform a menu-by-menu, site-by-site search for\
    \ information.\n   When a user selects an item from the menu of a VERONICA search,\n\
    \   \"sessions\" are automatically established with the appropriate Gopher\n \
    \  servers, and a list of data items is returned to the originating\n   Gopher\
    \ client in the form of a Gopher menu so that the user can\n   access the files.\
    \ VERONICA is available as an option on many Gopher\n   servers.\n   Another Gopher-adjunct\
    \ is JUGHEAD (Jonzy's Universal Gopher Hierarchy\n   Excavation And Display).\
    \ JUGHEAD supports key word searches and the\n   use of logical operators (AND,\
    \ OR, and NOT). The result of a JUGHEAD\n   search is a display of all menu items\
    \ which match the search string\n   which are located in the University of Manchester\
    \ and UMIST\n   Information Server, working from a static database that is re-created\n\
    \   every day. JUGHEAD is available from many Gopher sites, although\n   VERONICA\
    \ may be a better tool for global searches.\n   The Wide Area Information Server\
    \ (WAIS, pronounced \"ways\") was\n   initiated jointly by Apple Computer, Dow\
    \ Jones, KMPG Peat Marwick,\n   and Thinking Machines Corp. It is a set of free-ware,\
    \ share-ware, and\n   commercial software products for a wide variety of hardware/software\n\
    \   platforms, which work together to help users find information on the\n   Internet.\
    \ WAIS provides a single interface through which a user can\n   access many different\
    \ information databases. The user interface\n   allows a query to be formulated\
    \ in English and the WAIS server will\n   automatically choose the appropriate\
    \ databases to search. Further\n   information about WAIS can be obtained by reading\
    \ the WAIS FAQ, from\n   host rtfm.mit.edu in file /pub/usenet/news.answers/wais-faq.\n"
- title: 7. The World Wide Web
  contents:
  - "7. The World Wide Web\n   The World Wide Web (WWW) is thought (erroneously) by\
    \ many to be the\n   same thing as the Internet. But the confusion, in many ways,\
    \ is\n   justified; by early 1996, the WWW accounted for over 40% of all of\n\
    \   the traffic on the Internet. In addition, the number of hosts on the\n   Internet\
    \ named www has grown from several hundred in mid-1994 to\n   17,000 in mid-1995\
    \ to 212,000 in mid-1996 to over 410,000 by early\n   1997. The Web has made information\
    \ on the Internet accessible to\n   users of all ages and computer skill levels.\
    \ It has provided a\n   mechanism so that nearly anyone can become a content provider.\n\
    \   According to some, growth in the number of WWW users is unparalleled\n   by\
    \ any other event in human history.\n   The WWW was developed in the early 1990s\
    \ at the CERN Institute for\n   Particle Physics in Geneva, Switzerland. The Web\
    \ was designed to\n   combine aspects of information retrieval with multimedia\n\
    \   communications, unlike archie and Gopher, which were primarily used\n   for\
    \ the indexing of text-based files. The Web allows users to access\n   information\
    \ in many different types of formats, including text,\n   sound, image, animation,\
    \ and video. WWW treats all searchable\n   Internet files as hypertext documents.\
    \  Hypertext is a term which\n   merely refers to text that contains pointers\
    \ to other text, allowing\n   a user reading one document to jump to another document\
    \ for more\n   information on a given topic, and then return to the same location\
    \ in\n   the original document. WWW hypermedia documents are able to employ\n\
    \   images, sound, graphics, video, and animation in addition to text.\n   To\
    \ access WWW servers, users must run client software called a\n   browser.  The\
    \ browser and server use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol\n   (HTTP) [3].  WWW\
    \ documents are written in the Hypertext Markup\n   Language (HTML) [2, 20], a\
    \ simple text-based formatting language that\n   is hardware and software platform-independent.\
    \ Users point the\n   browser at some location using a shorthand format called\
    \ a Uniform\n   Resource Locator (URL), which allows a WWW servers to obtain files\n\
    \   from any location on the public Internet using a variety of\n   protocols,\
    \ including HTTP, FTP, Gopher, and TELNET.\n   Mosaic, developed in 1994 at the\
    \ National Center for Supercomputer\n   Applications (NCSA) at the University\
    \ of Illinois at Urbana-\n   Champaign, was the first widely-used browser. Because\
    \ it was\n   available at no cost over the Internet via anonymous FTP, and had\
    \ a\n   version for Windows, Mac, and UNIX systems, Mosaic was probably the\n\
    \   single reason that the Web attracted so many users so quickly. The\n   most\
    \ commonly used browsers today include the Netscape Navigator\n   (http://www.netscape.com),\
    \ Microsoft's Internet Explorer\n   (http://www.microsoft.com), and NCSA Mosaic\n\
    \   (http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/).\n   The WWW is ideally suited\
    \ to a windows environment, or other point-\n   and-click graphical user interface.\
    \ Nevertheless, several text-based\n   Web browsers do exist, although their usefulness\
    \ is limited if trying\n   to obtain graphical images, or audio or video clips.\
    \ One text-based\n   Web browser is Lynx, and an example of its use is shown below.\
    \ Items\n   in square brackets in the sample dialogue are Lynx's way of\n   indicating\
    \ an image or other display that cannot be shown on an ASCII\n   terminal.\n \

  - "7.2. User Directories on the Web\n   While finding users on the Internet remains\
    \ somewhat like alchemy if\n   using the tools and utilities mentioned earlier,\
    \ the Web has added a\n   new dimension to finding people. Since 1995, many telephone\
    \ companies\n   have placed national white and yellow page telephone directories\
    \ on-\n   line, accessible via the World Wide Web.\n   For a while, it seemed\
    \ that the easiest and most reliable approach to\n   finding people's e-mail address\
    \ on the Internet was to look up their\n   telephone number on the Web, call them,\
    \ and ask for their e-mail\n   address! More recently, however, many third parties\
    \ are augmenting\n   the standard telephone directory with an e-mail directory.\
    \ These\n   services primarily rely on users voluntarily registering, resulting\n\
    \   in incomplete databases because most users don't know about all of\n   the\
    \ services.  Nevertheless, some of the personal directory services\n   available\
    \ via the Web with which e-mail addresses (and telephone\n   numbers) can be found\
    \ include Four11 Directory Services\n   (http://www.Four11.com/), Excite\n   (http://www.excite.com/Reference/locators.html),\

  - "8. Discussion Lists and Newsgroups\n   Among the most useful features of the\
    \ Internet are the discussion\n   lists that have become available to allow individuals\
    \ to discuss\n   topics of mutual concern. Discussion list topics range from SCUBA\n\
    \   diving and home brewing of beer to AIDS research and foreign policy.\n   Several,\
    \ naturally, deal specifically with the Internet, TCP/IP\n   protocols, and the\
    \ impact of new technologies.\n   Most of the discussion lists accessible from\
    \ the Internet are\n   unmoderated, meaning that anyone can send a message to\
    \ the list's\n   central repository and the message will then be automatically\n\
    \   forwarded to all subscribers of the list. These lists provide very\n   fast\
    \ turn-around between submission of a message and delivery, but\n   often result\
    \ in a lot of messages (including inappropriate junk mail,\n   or \"spam\"). A\
    \ moderated list has an extra step; a human list\n   moderator examines all messages\
    \ before they are forwarded to ensure\n   that the messages are appropriate to\
    \ the list and not needlessly\n   inflammatory!\n   Users should be warned that\
    \ some lists generate a large number of\n   messages each day. Before subscribing\
    \ to too many lists, be sure that\n   you are aware of local policies and/or charges\
    \ governing access to\n   discussion lists and e-mail storage.\n"

    \ types of hosts. Usenet clients, called newsreaders, use\n   the Network News\
    \ Transfer Protocol [13] and are available for\n   virtually any operating system;\
    \ several web browsers, in fact, have\n   this capability built in.\n   While\
    \ Usenet newsgroups are usually accessible at Internet sites, a\n   prospective\
    \ Usenet client host must have appropriate newsreader\n   software to be able\
    \ to read news. Users will have to check with their\n   local host or network\
    \ administrator to find out what Usenet\n   newsgroups are locally available,\
    \ as well as the local policies for\n   using them.\n   Usenet newsgroup names\
    \ are hierarchical in nature. The first part of\n   the name, called the hierarchy,\
    \ provides an indication about the\n   general subject area. There are two types\
    \ of hierarchies, called\n   mainstream and alternative; the total number of newsgroups\
    \ is in the\n   thousands. The news.announce.newusers newsgroup is a good place\
    \ for\n   new Usenet users to find a detailed introduction to the use of\n   Usenet,\
    \ as well as an introduction to its culture.\n   Usenet mainstream hierarchies\
    \ are established by a process that\n   requires the approval of a majority of\

    \ early 1990s,\n   however, so many specifications of various protocols had been\
    \ written\n   that it was not always clear as to which documents represented\n\
    \   standards for the Internet. For that reason, a subset of RFCs have\n   been\
    \ designated as STDs to identify them as Internet standards.\n   Unlike RFC numbers\
    \ that are never reused, STD numbers always refer to\n   the latest version of\
    \ the standard. UDP, for example, would be\n   completely identified as \"STD-6/RFC-768.\"\
    \  Note that STD numbers\n   refer to a standard, which is not necessarily a single\
    \ document; STD\n   19, for example, is the NetBIOS Service Protocols standard\
    \ comprising\n   RFCs 1001 and 1002, and a complete citation for this standard\
    \ would\n   be \"STD-19/RFC-001/RFC-1002.\"\n   The availability of new STDs is\

  contents:
  - "9.3. For Your Information Documents\n   The For Your Information (FYI) series\
    \ of RFCs provides Internet users\n   with information about many topics related\
    \ to the Internet. FYI\n   topics range from historical to explanatory to tutorial,\
    \ and are\n   aimed at the wide spectrum of people that use the Internet. The\
    \ FYI\n   series includes answers to frequently asked questions by both\n   beginning\
    \ and seasoned users of the Internet, an annotated\n   bibliography of Internet\
    \ books, and an explanation of the domain name\n   system.\n   Like the STDs,\
    \ an FYI number always refers to the latest version of\n   an FYI. FYI 4, for\
    \ example, refers to the answers to commonly asked\n   questions by new Internet\
    \ users; its complete citation would be\n   \"FYI-4/RFC-1594.\"  The FYI notes\
    \ are explained in FYI 1 [18].\n   FYIs can be obtained as RFCs via anonymous\
    \ FTP from any RFC\n   repository.  In addition, some RFC sites (such as ds.internic.net)\n\
    \   provide an FYI directory so that FYI documents can be found in the\n   path\
    \ /FYI/xx.TXT, where xx refers to the FYI number.\n   FYI documents may be obtained\
    \ as RFCs using the methods described in\n   Section 9.1. FYIs may also be obtained\

- title: 9.4. Best Current Practices
  contents:
  - "9.4. Best Current Practices\n   Standards track RFCs are formally part of the\
    \ IETF standards process,\n   subject to peer review, and intended to culminate\
    \ in an official\n   Internet Standard. Other RFCs are published on a less formal\
    \ basis\n   and are not part of the IETF process. To provide a mechanism of\n\
    \   publishing relevant technical information which it endorsed, the IETF\n  \
    \ created a new series of RFCs, called the Best Current Practices (BCP)\n   series.\
    \ BCP topics include variances from the Internet standards\n   process and IP\
    \ address allocation in private networks.\n   Like the STDs and FYIs, a BCP number\
    \ always refers to the latest\n   version of a BCP. BCP 5, for example, describes\
    \ an IP address\n   allocation plan for private networks; its complete citation\
    \ would be\n   \"BCP-5/RFC-1918.\"  The BCP process is explained in BCP 1 [25].\n\
    \   BCP documents may be obtained as RFCs using the methods described in\n   Section\
    \ 9.1. BCPs may also be obtained via the RFC-INFO server using\n   the RETRIEVE:\
    \ BCP and Doc-ID: BCPxxxx commands. Also, check out the\n   RFC Editor's Web site\

- title: 10. Perusing the Internet
  contents:
  - "10. Perusing the Internet\n   This guide is intended to provide the reader with\
    \ a rudimentary\n   ability to use the utilities that are provided by TCP/IP and\
    \ the\n   Internet. By now, it is clear that the user's knowledge, ability, and\n\
    \   willingness to experiment are about the only limits to what can be\n   accomplished.\n\
    \   There are several books that will help you get started finding sites\n   on\
    \ the Internet, including The INTERNET Yellow Pages [9]. But much\n   more timely\
    \ and up-to-date information can be found on the Internet\n   itself, using such\
    \ search tools as Yahoo! (http://www.yahoo.com),\n   Excite (http://www.excite.com),\
    \ Lycos (http://www.lycos.com),\n   WebCrawler (http://www.webcrawler.com), and\
    \ AltaAvista\n   (http://altavista.digital.com).\n   There are several other sources\
    \ that cite locations from which to\n   access specific information about a wide\
    \ range of subjects using such\n   tools as FTP, Telnet, Gopher, and WWW. One\
    \ of the best periodic\n   lists, and archives, is through the Scout Report, a\
    \ weekly\n   publication by the InterNIC's Net Scout Services Project at the\n\
    \   University of Wisconsin's Computer Science Department. To receive the\n  \
    \ Scout Report by e-mail each week, join the mailing list by sending\n   email\
    \ to listserv@lists.internic.net; place the line subscribe\n   scout-report your_full_name\
    \ in the body of the message to receive the\n   text version or use subscribe\
    \ scout-report-html your_full_name to\n   receive the report in HTML. The Scout\
    \ Report is also available on the\n   Web at http://www.cs.wisc.edu/scout/report\
    \ and\n   http://rs.internic.net/scout/report, or via anonymous FTP at\n   ftp://rs.internic.net/scout/.\n\
    \   Another list is Yanoff's Internet Services List, which may be found\n   at\
    \ http://www.spectracom.com/islist/ or\n   ftp://ftp.csd.uwm.edu/pub/inet.services.txt.\
    \ Gary Kessler, one of the\n   co-author's of this document, maintains his own\
    \ eclectic\n   Miscellaneous Sites List at\n   http://www.together.net/~kessler/gck_site.html.\n\
    \   If you are looking for Internet-specific information, one good\n   starting\
    \ point is\n   http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Internet/. The InterNIC\n\
    \   is another valuable resource, with their Scout Report and Scout\n   Toolkit\
    \ (http://rs.internic.net/scout/toolkit).\n   There is also a fair amount of rudimentary\
    \ tutorial information\n   available on the Internet. The InterNIC cosponsors\
    \ \"The 15 Minute\n   Series\" (http://rs.internic.net/nic-support/15min/), a\
    \ collection of\n   free, modular, and extensible training materials on specific\
    \ Internet\n   topics. ROADMAP96 (http://www.ua.edu/~crispen/roadmap.html) is\
    \ a\n   free, 27-lesson Internet training workshop over e-mail.\n   More books\
    \ and specialized articles came out about the Internet in\n   1993 and 1994 than\
    \ in all previous years (squared!), and that trend\n   has seemed to continue\
    \ into 1995, 1996, and beyond. Three books are\n   worth notable mention because\
    \ they do not directly relate to finding\n   your way around, or finding things\
    \ on, the Internet. Hafner and Lyon\n   [8] have written Where Wizards Stay Up\
    \ Late: The Origins of the\n   Internet, a history of the development of the Advanced\
    \ Research\n   Projects Agency (ARPA), packet switching, and the ARPANET, focusing\n\
    \   primarily on the 1960s and 1970s. While culminating with the\n   APRANET's\
    \ 25th Anniversary in 1994, its main thrusts are on the\n   groups building the\
    \ ARPANET backbone (largely BBN) and the host-to-\n   host application and communication\
    \ protocols (largely the Network\n   Working Group). Salus' book, Casting The\
    \ Net: From ARPANET to\n   INTERNET and beyond... [28], goes into the development\
    \ of the network\n   from the perspective of the people, protocols, applications,\
    \ and\n   networks. Including a set of \"diversions,\" his book is a bit more\n\
    \   whimsical than Hafner & Lyon's. Finally, Carl Malamud has written a\n   delightful\
    \ book called Exploring the Internet: A Technical Travelogue\n   [17], chronicling\
    \ not the history of the Internet as much as a subset\n   of the people currently\
    \ active in building and defining  it. This\n   book will not teach you how to\
    \ perform an anonymous FTP file transfer\n   nor how to use Gopher, but provides\
    \ insights about our network (and\n   Carl's gastro-pathology) that no mere statistics\
    \ can convey.\n"
