- title: 1) Abstract
  contents:
  - "1) Abstract\n   A new URL scheme, \"vemmi\" is defined. It allows VEMMI client\
    \ software\n   and VEMMI terminals to connect to multimedia interactive services\n\
    \   compliant to the VEMMI standard (Enhanced Man-Machine Interface for\n   Videotex\
    \ and Multimedia/Hypermedia Information Retrieval Services),\n   sometimes abbreviated\
    \ as \"VErsatile MultiMedia Interface\".\n   VEMMI is a new international standard\
    \ for on-line multimedia\n   services, that is both an ITU-T (International Telecommunications\n\
    \   Union, ex.  CCITT)  International Standard (T.107) [2] and an\n   European\
    \ Standard (ETSI European Telecommunications Standard\n   Institute) standard\
    \ (ETS 300 382  [3], obsoleted by ETS 300 709 [1]).\n   VEMMI could be described\
    \ as an on-line multimedia protocol describing\n   both the man-machine interface\
    \ and the client/server exchange\n   protocol.  VEMMI operates usually on a single\
    \ continuous session\n   between a client and a host and supports an object-oriented,\
    \ event-\n   driven, client/server oriented and platform independent multimedia\n\
    \   interface. The well-known tcp port number 575 has been assigned by\n   IANA\
    \ to the VEMMI protocol [13].\n   A description of the VEMMI standard along with\
    \ its last approved\n   version is publicly available on the Web: see the URL\n\
    \   http://www.etsi.fr/ecs/projects/vemmi/vemmi.htm). A presentation of\n   VEMMI\
    \ can be found on http://www.mctel.fr/VEMMI/vemmien_intro.html\n"

  - "2) VEMMI URL scheme utility and operability:\n   - VEMMI service selection: A\
    \ VEMMI multimedia server will listen on\n     its VEMMI well-known port for incoming\
    \ connections. The server\n     could of course be engaged in many simultaneous\
    \ connections, and\n     after a connection is established, the terminal must\
    \ be able to\n     select the desired VEMMI application, as a same system may\
    \ host\n     different VEMMI applications.\n     The best mechanism to fully describe\
    \ the VEMMI service to activate\n     is the URL mechanism.\n     - Reporting\
    \ user action to a remote server: The VEMMI protocol\n     establishes a continuous\
    \ TCP/IP link between the terminal and the\n     server during the whole user\
    \ session. During a session managing\n     VEMMI objects, the user actions are\
    \ usually reported back to the\n     server using the VEMMI user data report mechanism\
    \ that is an\n     integral part of the VEMMI protocol.\n     However, in some\
    \ case, the URL mechanism may be required to send\n     back reports to a remote\
    \ host. VEMMI is for example able to display\n     HTML documents within a multimedia\
    \ display area in a VEMMI dialog\n     box. these HTML documents may be managed\
    \ either by the VEMMI server\n     (acting as a proxy gateway) or directly by\
    \ the client software that\n     will issue itself the HTTP requests on the network\
    \ and browse\n     across documents on the Web as a standard Web browser (the\
    \ link to\n     the VEMMI server is kept and used for interacting with other VEMMI\n\
    \     objects and components but the VEMMI server may not be informed of\n   \
    \  the user navigation on the Web inside the multimedia area).\n     In such a\
    \ case, the URL mechanism could also be used to report the\n     user actions\
    \ and commands within a HTML document to be reported to\n     the VEMMI server\
    \ or even another system.\n   - Extension of Web browsers: The VEMMI protocol\
    \ is quite\n     complementary to HTTP/HTML used by Web browsers, and several\n\
    \     networks operators have decided to support jointly Web and VEMMI\n     (seen\
    \ as complementary protocols). Thanks to the VEMMI URL, Web\n     browsers will\
    \ be able to activate a VEMMI client software module to\n     start a VEMMI session\
    \ to the requested service when the user\n     activate a vemmi URL included in\
    \ the HTML document.\n"
- title: 3) Description of the VEMMI scheme
  contents:
  - "3) Description of the VEMMI scheme\n   The VEMMI URL scheme is used to designate\
    \ multimedia interactive\n   services conforming to the VEMMI standard (ITU/T\
    \ T.107 and ETS 300\n   709).\n   A VEMMI URL takes the form:\n       vemmi://<host>:<port>/<vemmiservice>;\n\
    \       <attribute>=<value>\n   as specified in Section 3.1. of RFC 1738. If :<port>\
    \ is omitted, the\n   port defaults to 575 (client software may choose to ignore\
    \ the\n   optional port number in order to increase security). The\n   <vemmiservice>\
    \ part is optional and may be omitted.\n   This URL does not designate a data\
    \ object, but rather a multimedia\n   interactive service. A VEMMI service starts\
    \ a multimedia session\n   managing multimedia objects and interacting with the\
    \ user during the\n   session. To the difference of other stateless protocols,\
    \ the link\n   between the client and the server is usually maintained during\
    \ the\n   whole session (although in some cases other mechanisms may be used,\n\
    \   see below).\n   The <vemmiservice> is the name of the VEMMI service to activate.\
    \ This\n   field is not mandatory and could be omitted for example if the remote\n\
    \   host manages only one VEMMI service or activates a VEMMI service by\n   default\
    \ when no service is specified. If this field is omitted in the\n   URL and the\
    \ server requests it, it is assumed that the VEMMI client\n   software will prompt\
    \ the user for it.\n   In addition, after the <vemmiservice>, optional attributes\
    \ and values\n   (parameters) associated with the VEMMI service may be specified\
    \ as\n   part of the URL. When present, each parameter (attribute/value pair)\n\
    \   is separated from each other and from the rest of the URL by a \";\"\n   (semicolon).\
    \ The name of the attribute and its value are separated by\n   a \"=\" (equal\
    \ sign). If present, these fields are used to transmit\n   additional data useful\
    \ for service selection or to request to perform\n   a specific processing. For\
    \ example, the $USERDATA field can be\n   specified to transmit additional user-specified\
    \ data to the VEMMI\n   service.\n"
- title: 4) Client/server dialog during service selection
  contents:
  - "4) Client/server dialog during service selection\n   The VEMMI client will interpret\
    \ the VEMMI URL to connect to the\n   remote host and to access the specified\
    \ VEMMI service. After\n   connecting to the remote system, the host may prompt\
    \ the VEMMI client\n   for service name and user identification.\n   Before starting\
    \ the VEMMI session, a VEMMI terminal is in 'standard'\n   mode and may display\
    \ the data received from the network in a videotex\n   or telnet terminal window.\
    \ As the VEMMI session may be started\n   anytime during an interactive videotex\
    \ or telnet session, the VEMMI\n   service selection is performed by a simple\
    \ dialog between the client\n   and the server.\n   The service, username and\
    \ password information are transmitted by the\n   client software to the host\
    \ in answer to the corresponding requests\n   received from the host. The following\
    \ behavior is expected from the\n   client:\n   - wait for the optional request\
    \ strings from the host server\n     ('service:', 'username:' and 'password:')\
    \ and answer them\n     (respectively by <vemmiservice> value defined in the URL\
    \ and the\n     <username> and <password> entered by the user if required).  The\n\
    \     terminal answer may be sent automatically if the answers are known\n   \
    \  (that is if they are specified in the URL or terminal\n     configuration)\
    \ or it may prompt the user for the needed\n     informations.  When parameters\
    \ (attribute and value pairs) are\n     present in the URL, these fields will\
    \ be sent following the\n     <vemmiservice> transmitted to the host in answer\
    \ to the 'service:'\n     request received from the host, separated from the <vemmiservice>\n\
    \     value by a semicolon.\n   - the client answers must always be followed by\
    \ a Carriage Return\n     (CR). If a Line Feed (LF) is transmitted after the CR,\
    \ it will be\n     ignored by the server.\n   - in both cases, the server may\
    \ echo the characters received from the\n     client terminal, the received CR\
    \ being echoed as CR LF. The server\n     may echo the password characters as\
    \ stars or any other scrambled\n     output for safety purpose.\n   - the client\
    \ must also be ready to start the VEMMI session as soon\n     as it receives the\
    \ VEMMI_Open command. Before starting this VEMMI\n     session, the terminal is\
    \ in 'standard' mode and may display the\n     data received from the network\
    \ in a videotex or telnet terminal\n     window (this is the reason why the service,\
    \ username and password\n     data are requested by the server using a telnet\
    \ or videotex\n     compatible dialog).\n   Should an error occur during VEMMI\
    \ service activation, the remote\n   host may inform the user by displaying the\
    \ error cause. It is\n   recommended that, when possible and applicable, the status\
    \ code\n   syntax described in HTTP [8] [9] be used to facilitate automatic\n\
    \   processing by the client of the host answer during error or normal\n   operation.\n\
    \   If a VEMMI client software wants to request a VEMMI object without\n   establishing\
    \ a continuous VEMMI session, such a request may also be\n   performed using a\
    \ HTTP request for the vemmi object encoded using the\n   Internet media type\
    \ application/vemmi (pending registration by IANA\n   [10]). In the same way,\
    \ HTTP could be used in some cases to exchange\n   data pertaining to a VEMMI\
    \ session with or without setting the keep-\n   alive keyword in the Connection\
    \ header to request a persistent\n   connection [9]. Protocol switching using\
    \ the upgrade header field may\n   be used in such case to switch to vemmi protocol\
    \ [9]. This possible\n   use of HTTP for VEMMI is not described in this document.\n"

    \ that does not enforce access control might be:\n        URL: vemmi://zeus.mctel.fr/demo\n\
    \      In this case, the exchange between client and server will be as\n     \
    \ follow (the server requests are presented left, client answers\n      right):\n\
    \   service:        demo\n   200 OK                     {status code returned\

    \ remote server\n      hosts only one VEMMI service), and the URL might then be:\n\
    \        URL: vemmi://zeus.mctel.fr\n      In this case, the VEMMI interactive\
    \ session is started immediately\n      by the host without requesting first the\
    \ service name (should the\n      client receive a service request from the host,\
    \ it will prompt the\n      user for service name).\n   c) The URL could not include\
    \ the username and password. In this case,\n      should they be requested by\
    \ the host, the VEMMI client may use a\n      default value specified for this\
    \ service or prompt the user for\n      them (for example it could propose anonymous\
    \ and user e-mail\n      address as defaults):\n        URL: vemmi://mctel.fr/demo\n\
    \      In this case, the exchange between client and server may be as\n      follows\
    \ (server requests at the left, client answers at the right):\n   service:   \

    \ is done by the host, the dialog might be:\n   service:        demo;$USERDATA=smith;account=1234\n\
    \   200 OK\n    ...starting VEMMI session...\n"
- title: 7)  Procedure to use when a VEMMI URL is encountered in a HTML document
  contents:
  - "7)  Procedure to use when a VEMMI URL is encountered in a HTML document\n   \
    \ without VEMMI support:\n   The VEMMI URL support may be built-in in some Web\
    \ browsers, or\n   offered by an associated software or plug-in interworking with\
    \ the\n   user browser, for example using the WWW_RegisterProtocol API command\n\
    \   to register the new VEMMI protocol.\n   When a Web browser encounters a VEMMI\
    \ URL without having VEMMI support,\n   two cases may occur:\n   - some browsers\
    \ will detect an unrecognized scheme and signal an\n     unrecoverable error directly.\n\
    \   - others will manage it as a relative URL [4] and will build a\n     complete\
    \ URL including the VEMMI URL and will request it from the\n     host having sent\
    \ the current document. In this case the host will\n     usually return the error\
    \ \"not found\".\n   Among the mechanisms that could be used in order to offer\
    \ a friendly\n   interface to both users with and without VEMMI support:\n   -\
    \ when the second case occurs and the relative URL including the\n     vemmi://\
    \ string is transmitted to the server, the HTTPD server may\n     be modified\
    \ in order to recognize such URL and to propose the\n     downloading of a VEMMI\
    \ client software.\n   - the HTML document including the vemmi URL allowing to\
    \ start the\n     VEMMI session may propose both options, for example:\n     \
    \   If your browser supports VEMMI, directly\n        <A HREF=\"vemmi://ares.mctel.fr/TEST\"\
    >start the interactive\n        multimedia service</A>, otherwise\n        <A\
    \ HREF=\"ftp://ftp.mctel.fr/vemmi.exe\">download first a VEMMI\n        client\
    \ software</A>.\n   - the application/vemmi MIME type is defined below (to allow\
    \ for\n     example exchange of vemmi objects). A possible way is for the\n  \
    \   server to look in the HTTP Accept header field and to deduce that if\n   \
    \  application/vemmi is supported, then the VEMMI support exists (in\n     this\
    \ case, application/vemmi is to be defined in the browser and\n     associated\
    \ with the vemmi decoder).\n"
- title: '8) Security Considerations:'
  contents:
  - "8) Security Considerations:\n   The VEMMI URL scheme is subject to the same security\
    \ implications as\n   the general URL scheme [5] [14], so the usual precautions\
    \ outlined in\n   [5] [14] apply (for example, it is not allowed to store the\
    \ username\n   and password in the URLs).\n   Furthermore, among VEMMI objects\
    \ that could be used during the\n   interactive session, metacode objects (representing\
    \ a sequence of\n   VEMMI commands) and operative objects (they are executable\
    \ programs\n   to be run on the client platform) may be downloaded and/or started.\n\
    \   In order to protect the user against the activation of an harmful\n   operative\
    \ object, it is strongly recommended that the users use the\n   configuration\
    \ menu of their VEMMI software to disable the option of\n   running operative\
    \ objects when receiving potentially unsafe VEMMI\n   objects, or at least enable\
    \ the option to request first user approval\n   before starting the execution\
    \ of an operative object.\n   The VEMMI remote interactive services may vary widely\
    \ in their access\n   control policies; in practice, when a prompt for username\
    \ or password\n   is received, the VEMMI terminal should request them from the\
    \ user.\n   The VEMMI terminal implementation could support additional features,\n\
    \   for example proposing by default \"anonymous\" as username and the user\n\
    \   Internet e-mail address as password, or looking in an encrypted local\n  \
    \ database for user identification on this service.\n   Such an identification\
    \ mechanism using the username/password scheme\n   is unsecure and is provided\
    \ for backwards compatibility only. The\n   VEMMI services requiring a safe identification\
    \ procedure must rely on\n   other alternative mechanisms (e.g. S/KEY or other).\
    \ In numerous\n   cases, the user identification procedure will be performed by\
    \ the\n   VEMMI service.\n"
