    \     The Stanford Research Institute's Artificial Intelligence Group (SRAI\n\
    in the four-letter abbreviations) expects connection to the ARPA net as a\nresearch\
    \ center after conversion this summer to a TENEX from our current\nPDP-10. Our\
    \ connection will be through the IMP already at SRI for the\ncontroller of peripherals.\
    \ Our hardware interface to the IMP is currently\nin the bidding process, and\
    \ we intend to use as much as possible of the\nTENEX network software. (Probably\
    \ all we will need to change is the lowest\nlevel, most strongly hardware-oriented\
    \ part of the NCP.)\n     The most optimistic estimate we can give for functional\
    \ connection to\nthe network is mid-July 1971. We are currently devoting the energies\
    \ of\nour system support group to the accomodation of various hardware and design\n\
    changes, and so our contact with the Network Working Group has been only\nminimal\
    \ and passive. It is entirely conceivable that we may find our par-\nticipation\
    \ tending to strength and activeness as we cross our other bridges.\n     We can\
    \ project our participation in the network into the first few\nmonths of our connection.\
    \ We can support several simultaneous outside\nusers on a system nominally up\
    \ during the business day and often up at\nother times. Lapses in continuity of\
    \ system operation are usually due to\nscheduled maintenance or hardware failures\
    \ and tend to occur at intervals\nof either an hour or several days with remarkable\
    \ consistency. The prin-\ncipal service we offer to other network participants\
    \ is the availability\nof various parts of our own research software. The most\
    \ notable examples\nare QA3.6, a first-order resolution theorem prover;  STRIPS,\
    \ an extra-\nlogical problem solver;  and possibly QA4, a language oriented toward\n\
    problem-solving strategies. The services we can anticipate requesting\nof the\
    \ network are of two kinds: We could conceivably use other people's\nartificial\
    \ intelligence programs on a trial basis; and we might use the\nnetwork to make\
    \ occasional contact with other people in the network.\n        [ This RFC was\
    \ put into machine readable form for entry ]\n        [ into the online RFC archives\
