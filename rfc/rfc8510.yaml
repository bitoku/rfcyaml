  - "1.  Introduction\n   Every OSPF interface is assigned an Interface ID that uniquely\n
    \  identifies the interface on the router.  [RFC2328] uses this\n   Interface
    ID in the Router Link State Advertisement (Router-LSA) Link\n   Data for unnumbered
    links and uses the value of the MIB-II ifIndex\n   [RFC2863].  [RFC4203] refers
    to these Interface IDs as the Link\n   Local/Remote Identifiers and defines a
    way to advertise and use them\n   for GMPLS purposes.  [RFC8379] defines a way
    to advertise Local/\n   Remote Interface IDs in the OSPFv2 Extended Link Opaque
    LSA.\n   There is a known OSPFv2 protocol problem in verifying the\n   bidirectional
    connectivity with parallel unnumbered links.  If there\n   are two parallel unnumbered
    links between a pair of routers and each\n   link is only advertised from a single
    direction, such two\n   unidirectional parallel links could be considered as a
    valid single\n   bidirectional link during the OSPF route computation on some
    other\n   router.  If each link is advertised with both its Local and Remote\n
    \  Interface IDs, the advertisement of each link from both sides of\n   adjacency
    can be verified by cross-checking the Local and Remote\n   Interface IDs of both
    advertisements.\n   From the perspective of the advertising router, the Local
    Interface\n   ID is a known value.  However, the Remote Interface ID needs to
    be\n   learned before it can be advertised.  [RFC4203] suggests using the TE\n
    \  Link Local LSA [RFC3630] to communicate the Local Interface ID to\n   neighbors
    on the link.  Though such a mechanism works, it has some\n   drawbacks.\n   This
    document proposes an extension to OSPF link-local signaling\n   (LLS) [RFC5613]
    to advertise the Local Interface ID.\n"
  - contents:
    - "1.1.  Interface ID Exchange Using Link Local TE Opaque LSA\n   Usage of the
      Link Local TE Opaque LSA to propagate the Local\n   Interface ID to the neighbors
      on the link is described in [RFC4203].\n   This mechanism has the following
      problems:\n   o  LSAs can only be flooded over an existing adjacency that is
      in\n      Exchange state or greater.  The adjacency state machine progresses\n
      \     independently on each side of the adjacency and, as such, may\n      reach
      the Full state on one side before the Link Local TE Opaque\n      LSA arrives.
      \ The consequence of this is that the link can be\n      initially advertised
      without the Remote Interface ID.  Later, when\n      the Link Local TE Opaque
      LSA arrives, the link must be advertised\n      again but this time with the
      valid Remote Interface ID.\n      Implementations may choose to wait before
      advertising the link,\n      but there is no guarantee that the neighbor will
      ever advertise\n      the Link Local TE Opaque LSA with the Interface ID.  In
      summary,\n      the existing mechanism does not guarantee that the Remote\n
      \     Interface ID is known at the time the link is advertised.\n   o  The Link
      Local TE Opaque LSA is defined for MPLS Traffic\n      Engineering, but the
      knowledge of the Remote Interface ID is\n      useful also for cases where MPLS
      TE is not used.  One example is\n      the mentioned lack of a valid 2-way connectivity
      check for\n      parallel point-to-point links between OSPF routers.\n"

  - "3.  Backward Compatibility with RFC 4203\n   If the Local Interface ID signaling
    via the Link Local TE Opaque LSA\n   is supported in addition to the new LLS mechanism,
    implementations\n   that support Local Interface ID signaling using LLS MUST prefer
    the\n   Local Interface ID value received through LLS over the value received\n
    \  through the Link Local TE Opaque LSA if both are received from the\n   same
    OSPF router.\n   Implementations that support Local Interface ID signaling via
    the\n   Link Local TE Opaque LSA MAY continue to do so to ensure backward\n   compatibility.
    \ If they also support Local Interface ID signaling\n   using LLS as described
    in the document, they MUST signal the same\n   Local Interface ID via both mechanisms.\n
    \  During the rare conditions in which the Local Interface ID changes, a\n   timing
    interval may exist where the received values of the Local\n   Interface ID advertised
    through LLS and the Link Local TE Opaque LSA\n   may differ.  Such a situation
    is temporary, and received values via\n   both mechanisms should become equal
    as soon as the next Hello and/or\n   Link Local TE Opaque LSA is regenerated by
    the originator.\n"

    Identifiers (TLV)\" registry.\n   18 - Local Interface ID TLV\n"
  title: 4.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations for \"OSPF Link-Local
    Signaling\" [RFC5613]\n   also apply to the Local Interface ID TLV described in
    this document.\n   The current usage of a neighbor's Local Interface ID is to\n
    \  disambiguate parallel links between OSPF routers.  Hence,\n   modification
    of the advertised Local Interface ID TLV may result in\n   the wrong neighbor
    Interface ID being advertised in the OSPFv2\n   Extended Link Opaque LSA [RFC7684]
    and could prevent the link from\n   being used.  If authentication is being used
    in the OSPF routing\n   domain [RFC5709][RFC7474], then the Cryptographic Authentication
    TLV\n   [RFC5613] SHOULD also be used to protect the contents of the LLS\n   block.\n
    \  Receiving a malformed LLS Local Interface ID TLV MUST NOT result in a\n   hard
    router or OSPF process failure.  The reception of malformed LLS\n   TLVs or sub-TLVs
    SHOULD be logged, but such logging MUST be rate-\n   limited to prevent denial-of-service
    (DoS) attacks.\n   The Interface ID is assigned by the advertising OSPF router
    as a\n   locally unique identifier and need not be unique in any broader\n   context;
    it is not expected to contain any information about the\n   device owner or traffic
    transiting the device, so there are no\n   privacy concerns associated with its
    advertisement.\n"
