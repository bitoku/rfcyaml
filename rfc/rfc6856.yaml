  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document forms part of the Email Address Internationalization\n
    \  protocols described in the Email Address Internationalization\n   Framework
    document [RFC6530].  As part of the overall Email Address\n   Internationalization
    work, email messages can be transmitted and\n   delivered containing a Unicode
    string encoded in UTF-8 in the header\n   and/or body, and maildrops that are
    accessed using POP3 [RFC1939]\n   might natively store Unicode characters.\n   This
    specification extends POP3 using the POP3 extension mechanism\n   [RFC2449] to
    permit un-encoded UTF-8 [RFC3629] in headers and bodies\n   (e.g., transferred
    using 8-bit content-transfer-encoding) as\n   described in \"Internationalized
    Email Headers\" [RFC6532].  It also\n   adds a mechanism to support login names
    and passwords containing a\n   UTF-8 string (see Section 1.1 below), a mechanism
    to support UTF-8\n   strings in protocol-level response strings, and the ability
    to\n   negotiate a language for such response strings.\n   This specification
    also adds a new response code to indicate that a\n   message was not delivered
    because it required UTF-8 mode (as\n   discussed in Section 2) and the server
    was unable or unwilling to\n   create and deliver a surrogate form of the message
    as discussed in\n   Section 7 of \"IMAP Support for UTF-8\" [RFC6855].\n   This
    specification replaces an earlier, experimental, approach to the\n   same problem
    [RFC5721].\n"

    - "1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST
      NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\",
      \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted
      as described in \"Key words for use in\n   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels\"
      [RFC2119].\n   The terms \"UTF-8 string\" or \"UTF-8 character\" are used to
      refer to\n   Unicode characters, which may or may not be members of the ASCII\n
      \  repertoire, encoded in UTF-8 [RFC3629], a standard Unicode encoding\n   form.
      \ All other specialized terms used in this specification are\n   defined in
      the Email Address Internationalization framework document.\n   In examples,
      \"C:\" and \"S:\" indicate lines sent by the client and\n   server, respectively.
      \ If a single \"C:\" or \"S:\" label applies to\n   multiple lines, then the
      line breaks between those lines are for\n   editorial clarity only and are not
      part of the actual protocol\n   exchange.\n   Note that examples always use
      ASCII characters due to limitations of\n   the RFC format; otherwise, some examples
      for the \"LANG\" command would\n   have appeared incorrectly.\n"

  - "2.  \"UTF8\" Capability\n   This specification adds a new POP3 Extension [RFC2449]
    capability\n   response tag and command to specify support for header field\n
    \  information outside the ASCII repertoire.  The capability tag and new\n   command
    and functionality are described below.\n   CAPA tag:\n      UTF8\n   Arguments
    with CAPA tag:\n      USER\n   Added Commands:\n      UTF8\n   Standard commands
    affected:\n      USER, PASS, APOP, LIST, TOP, RETR\n   Announced states / possible
    differences:\n      both / no\n   Commands valid in states:\n      AUTHORIZATION\n
    \  Specification reference:\n      this document\n   Discussion:\n   This capability
    adds the \"UTF8\" command to POP3.  The \"UTF8\" command\n   switches the session
    from the ASCII-only mode of POP3 [RFC1939] to\n   UTF-8 mode.  The UTF-8 mode
    means that all messages transmitted\n   between servers and clients are UTF-8
    strings, and both servers and\n   clients can send and accept UTF-8 strings.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  The \"UTF8\" Command\n   The \"UTF8\" command enables UTF-8 mode.  The
      \"UTF8\" command has no\n   parameters.\n   UTF-8 mode has no effect on messages
      in an ASCII-only maildrop.\n   Messages in native Unicode maildrops can be encoded
      in UTF-8 using\n   internationalized headers [RFC6532], in 8bit\n   content-transfer-encoding
      (see Section 2.8 of MIME [RFC2045]), in\n   ASCII, or in any combination of
      these options.  In UTF-8 mode, if the\n   character encoding format of maildrops
      is UTF-8 or ASCII, the\n   messages are sent to the client as is; if the character
      encoding\n   format of maildrops is a format other than UTF-8 or ASCII, the\n
      \  messages' encoding format SHOULD be converted to be UTF-8 before they\n   are
      sent to the client.  When UTF-8 mode has not been enabled,\n   character strings
      outside the ASCII repertoire MUST NOT be sent to\n   the client as is.  If a
      client requests a UTF-8 message when UTF-8\n   mode is not enabled, the server
      MUST either send the client a\n   surrogate message that complies with unextended
      POP and Internet Mail\n   Format without UTF-8 mode support, or fail the request
      with an -ERR\n   response.  See Section 7 of \"IMAP Support for UTF-8\" [RFC6855]
      for\n   information about creating a surrogate message and for a discussion\n
      \  of potential issues.  Section 5 of this document discusses \"UTF8\"\n   response
      codes.  The server MAY respond to the \"UTF8\" command with an\n   -ERR response.\n
      \  Note that even in UTF-8 mode, MIME binary content-transfer-encoding\n   as
      defined in Section 6.2 of MIME [RFC2045] is still not permitted.\n   MIME 8bit
      content-transfer-encoding (8BITMIME) [RFC6152] is obviously\n   allowed.\n   The
      octet count (size) of a message reported in a response to the\n   \"LIST\" command
      SHOULD match the actual number of octets sent in a\n   \"RETR\" response (not
      counting byte-stuffing).  Sizes reported\n   elsewhere, such as in \"STAT\"
      responses and non-standardized,\n   free-form text in positive status indicators
      (following \"+OK\") need\n   not be accurate, but it is preferable if they are.\n
      \  Normal operation for maildrops that natively support non-ASCII\n   characters
      will be for both servers and clients to support the\n   extension discussed
      in this specification.  Upgrading both clients\n   and servers is the only fully
      satisfactory way to support the\n   capabilities offered by the \"UTF8\" extension
      and SMTPUTF8 mail more\n   generally.  Servers must, however, anticipate the
      possibility of a\n   client attempting to access a message that requires this
      extension\n   without having issued the \"UTF8\" command.  There are no completely\n
      \  satisfactory responses for this case other than upgrading the client\n   to
      support this specification.  One solution, unsatisfactory because\n   the user
      may be confused by being able to access the message through\n   some means and
      not others, is that a server MAY choose to reject the\n   command to retrieve
      the message as discussed in Section 5.  Other\n   alternatives, including the
      possibility of creating and delivering a\n   surrogate form of the message,
      are discussed in Section 7 of \"IMAP\n   Support for UTF-8\" [RFC6855].\n   Clients
      MUST NOT issue the \"STLS\" command [RFC2595] after issuing\n   UTF8; servers
      MAY (but are not required to) enforce this by rejecting\n   with an -ERR response
      an \"STLS\" command issued subsequent to a\n   successful \"UTF8\" command.
      \ (Because this is a protocol error as\n   opposed to a failure based on conditions,
      an extended response code\n   [RFC2449] is not specified.)\n"

  - contents:
    - "2.2.  USER Argument to \"UTF8\" Capability\n   If the USER argument is included
      with this capability, it indicates\n   that the server accepts UTF-8 usernames
      and passwords.\n   Servers that include the USER argument in the \"UTF8\" capability\n
      \  response SHOULD apply SASLprep [RFC4013] or one of its Standards\n   Track
      successors to the arguments of the \"USER\" and \"PASS\" commands.\n   A client
      or server that supports APOP and permits UTF-8 in usernames\n   or passwords
      MUST apply SASLprep or one of its Standards Track\n   successors to the username
      and password used to compute the APOP\n   digest.\n   When applying SASLprep,
      servers MUST reject UTF-8 usernames or\n   passwords that contain a UTF-8 character
      listed in Section 2.3 of\n   SASLprep.  When applying SASLprep to the USER argument,
      the PASS\n   argument, or the APOP username argument, a compliant server or
      client\n   MUST treat them as a query string [RFC3454].  When applying SASLprep\n
      \  to the APOP password argument, a compliant server or client MUST\n   treat
      them as a stored string [RFC3454].\n   If the server includes the USER argument
      in the UTF8 capability\n   response, the client MAY use UTF-8 characters with
      a \"USER\", \"PASS\",\n   or \"APOP\" command; the client MAY do so before issuing
      the \"UTF8\"\n   command.  Clients MUST NOT use UTF-8 characters when authenticating\n
      \  if the server did not include the USER argument in the UTF8\n   capability
      response.\n   The server MUST reject UTF-8 usernames or passwords that fail
      to\n   comply with the formal syntax in UTF-8 [RFC3629].\n   Use of UTF-8 strings
      in the \"AUTH\" command is governed by the POP3\n   SASL [RFC5034] mechanism.\n"

    - "3.2.  Discussion\n   POP3 allows most +OK and -ERR server responses to include
      human-\n   readable text that, in some cases, might be presented to the user.\n
      \  But that text is limited to ASCII by the POP3 specification\n   [RFC1939].
      \ The \"LANG\" capability and command permit a POP3 client to\n   negotiate
      which language the server uses when sending human-readable\n   text.\n   The
      \"LANG\" command requests that human-readable text included in all\n   subsequent
      +OK and -ERR responses be localized to a language matching\n   the language
      range argument (the \"basic language range\" as described\n   by the \"Matching
      of Language Tags\" [RFC4647]).  If the command\n   succeeds, the server returns
      a +OK response followed by a single\n   space, the exact language tag selected,
      and another space.  Human-\n   readable text in the appropriate language then
      appears in the rest of\n   the line.  This, and subsequent protocol-level human-readable
      text,\n   is encoded in the UTF-8 charset.\n   If the command fails, the server
      returns an -ERR response and\n   subsequent human-readable response text continues
      to use the language\n   that was previously used.\n   If the client issues a
      \"LANG\" command with the special \"*\" language\n   range argument, it indicates
      a request to use a language designated\n   as preferred by the server administrator.
      \ The preferred language MAY\n   vary based on the currently active user.\n
      \  If no argument is given and the POP3 server issues a positive\n   response,
      that response will usually consist of multiple lines.\n   After the initial
      +OK, for each language tag the server supports, the\n   POP3 server responds
      with a line for that language.  This line is\n   called a \"language listing\".\n
      \  In order to simplify parsing, all POP3 servers are required to use a\n   certain
      format for language listings.  A language listing consists of\n   the language
      tag [RFC5646] of the message, optionally followed by a\n   single space and
      a human-readable description of the language in the\n   language itself, using
      the UTF-8 charset.  There is no specific order\n   to the listing of languages;
      the order may depend on configuration or\n   implementation.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of UTF-8 [RFC3629],
    SASLprep [RFC4013],\n   and the Unicode Format for Network Interchange [RFC5198]
    apply to\n   this specification, particularly with respect to use of UTF-8 strings\n
    \  in usernames and passwords.\n   The \"LANG *\" command might reveal the existence
    and preferred\n   language of a user to an active attacker probing the system
    if the\n   active language changes in response to the \"USER\", \"PASS\", or \"APOP\"\n
    \  commands prior to validating the user's credentials.  Servers are\n   strongly
    advised to implement a configuration to prevent this\n   exposure.\n   It is possible
    for a man-in-the-middle attacker to insert a \"LANG\"\n   command in the command
    stream, thus, making protocol-level diagnostic\n   responses unintelligible to
    the user.  A mechanism to protect the\n   integrity of the session can be used
    to defeat such attacks.  For\n   example, a client can issue the \"STLS\" command
    [RFC2595] before\n   issuing the \"LANG\" command.\n   As with other internationalization
    upgrades, modifications to server\n   authentication code (in this case, to support
    non-ASCII strings) need\n   to be done with care to avoid introducing vulnerabilities
    (for\n   example, in string parsing or matching).  This is particularly\n   important
    if the native databases or mailstore of the operating\n   system use some character
    set or encoding other than Unicode in\n   UTF-8.\n"

  - "Appendix A.  Design Rationale\n   This non-normative section discusses the reasons
    behind some of the\n   design choices in this specification.\n   Due to interoperability
    problems with the MIME Message Header\n   Extensions [RFC2047] and limited deployment
    of the extended MIME\n   parameter encodings [RFC2231], it is hoped these 7-bit
    encoding\n   mechanisms can be deprecated in the future when UTF-8 header support\n
    \  becomes prevalent.\n   The USER capability (Section 2.2) and hence the upgraded
    \"USER\"\n   command and additional support for non-ASCII credentials, are\n   optional
    because the implementation burden of SASLprep [RFC4013] is\n   not well understood,
    and mandating such support in all cases could\n   negatively impact deployment.\n"
