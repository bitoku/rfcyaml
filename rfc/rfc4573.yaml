  - "Abstract\n   In conversational video applications, far-end camera control protocol\n\
    \   is used by participants to control the remote camera.  The protocol\n   that\
    \ is commonly used is ITU H.281 over H.224.  The document\n   registers the H224\
    \ media type.  It defines the syntax and the\n   semantics of the Session Description\
    \ Protocol (SDP) parameters needed\n   to support far-end camera control protocol\
    \ using H.224.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The document registers the H224 media type, which may be\
    \ used by\n   systems that use SDP [RFC4566].\n   This media type is used for\
    \ supporting the simple far-end camera\n   control protocol on SDP-based systems.\
    \  The media type helps\n   signaling gateways between H.323 [ITU.H323] and SDP-based\
    \ systems to\n   use far-end camera control, end to end, without any protocol\n\
    \   translation in the middle.\n   The document defines the H224 media type since\
    \ the RTP packets in\n   H.323 annex Q [ITU.H323] carry H.224 frames [ITU.H224].\
    \  The far-end\n   camera control protocol (FECC) is internal to the H.224 frame\
    \ and is\n   identified by the client ID field of the H.224 packet.\n   The document\
    \ will define the SDP [RFC4566] parameters needed to\n   support the above far-end\
    \ camera control protocol in systems that use\n   SDP.\n"

- title: 5.1.  Usage with the SDP Offer Answer Model
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Usage with the SDP Offer Answer Model\n   When offering FECC using SDP\
    \ in an Offer/Answer model [RFC3264], the\n   following considerations are necessary.\n\
    \   Far-end camera control communication is uni-directional.  H.224 is\n   bi-directional\
    \ and can be used to learn the capabilities of the\n   remote video end point,\
    \ e.g., how many cameras it has.  The offer\n   answer exchange is dependent on\
    \ the functionality of both sides.\n   The offerer offers a sendonly channel if\
    \ its camera cannot be\n   remotely controlled and if the offerer does not intend\
    \ to use H.224\n   to learn the capabilities of the remote video endpoints.\n\
    \   In all other cases, when the offerer's camera can be remotely\n   controlled\
    \ and/or it intends to use H.224 capabilities negotiation,\n   the offerer offers\
    \ a sendrecv channel.\n   The answerer behavior is as follows:\n   If it receives\
    \ an offer with sendonly, it answers with a recvonly if\n   it supports far-end\
    \ camera control; otherwise, it ignores/rejects the\n   offer.\n   If it receives\
    \ an offer with sendrecv and its camera can be remotely\n   controlled, or it\
    \ intends to use H.224 capabilities negotiation, it\n   answers with a sendrecv\
    \ option.  If its camera cannot be remotely\n   controlled, it can answer with\
    \ a sendonly attribute.  The answerer\n   may also reject the offer if he does\
    \ not support FECC or does not\n   intend to use FECC at the moment.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   H.224 payload format, defined in H.323, annex\
    \ Q defines packet\n   structure based on RTP using the RTP header structure from\
    \ RFC 3550.\n   Those packets are subject to the security considerations discussed\
    \ in\n   the RTP specification [RFC3550].  This implies that confidentiality\n\
    \   of the media streams is achieved by encryption.  Secure Realtime\n   Transport\
    \ Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711] may be used to provide both\n   encryption and integrity\
    \ protection of RTP flow.\n   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for\
    \ data that causes\n   application behavior like camera movement.  The attacker\
    \ can inject\n   pathological datagrams into the stream that cause the receiver\
    \ to\n   change the camera position.  Therefore, the usage of data origin\n  \
    \ authentication and data integrity protection of at least the H.323\n   annex\
    \ Q packet is RECOMMENDED; for example, with SRTP.\n   Note that the appropriate\
    \ mechanism to ensure confidentiality and\n   integrity of H.323 annex Q packets\
    \ and their payloads is very\n   dependent on the application and on the transport\
    \ and signaling\n   protocols employed.  Thus, although SRTP is given as an example\n\
    \   above, other possible choices exist.\n"
