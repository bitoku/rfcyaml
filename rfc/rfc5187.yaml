  - "1.  Introduction\n   Graceful OSPF restart [GRACE] describes a mechanism to restart
    the\n   control plane of an OSPFv2 [OSPFv2] router that still has its\n   forwarding
    plane intact with a minimum of disruption to the network.\n   In general, the
    methods described in [GRACE] work for OSPFv3 [OSPFv3]\n   as well.  However, OSPFv3
    will use a grace-LSA with a different\n   format to signal that a router is initiating
    (or is about to\n   initiate) a graceful restart.  This document describes other
    OSPFv3\n   differences as well.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction

  - "2.  Grace Link State Advertisement\n   An OSPFv3 router initiating a graceful
    restart of its OSPFv3 software\n   originates grace-LSAs.  A grace-LSA requests
    that the router's\n   neighbors aid in its graceful restart by continuing to advertise
    the\n   router as fully adjacent during the specified grace period.  The\n   grace-LSA
    contains the restarting router grace-period and the reason\n   code indicating
    the reason for the graceful restart.\n   In OSPFv3 (refer to section 2.11 of [OSPFv3]),
    neighboring routers on\n   any link are always identified by their router IDs.
    \ This contrasts\n   with the OSPFv2 behavior where neighbors on point-to-point
    networks\n   and virtual links are identified by their Router IDs, while neighbors\n
    \  on broadcast, Non-Broadcast Multi-Access (NBMA), and point-to-\n   multipoint
    links are identified by their IPv4 interface addresses.\n   Consequently, there
    is no requirement for the router-address TLV\n   [GRACE] for OSPFv3 graceful restart.\n
    \  The TLV formats of the grace-LSA described in [GRACE] remain\n   unchanged.\n"

    - "3.1.  Preservation of LSA ID to Prefix Correspondence\n   In OSPFv2, there
      is a direct correspondence between summary and\n   external LSA IDs and the
      prefixes being advertised.  However, in\n   OSPFv3, the LSA ID for inter-area
      prefix LSAs and external LSAs is\n   simply an unsigned 32-bit integer.  Hence,
      to avoid network churn\n   during graceful restart, the restarting router MUST
      preserve the LSA\n   ID to prefix correspondence across graceful restarts.\n"

  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Preservation of Interface IDs for Link-LSAs, Network-LSAs, and\n      Router-LSAs\n
      \  In OSPFv3, the LSA ID for Link-LSAs and Network-LSAs and link\n   descriptions
      in Router-LSAs map to their corresponding Interface ID.\n   Changes in the Interface
      ID during graceful restart will result in a\n   mismatch between the restarting
      router's pre-restart LSAs and its\n   neighbor adjacency state.  These disparities
      will cause the graceful\n   restart to terminate prematurely.\n   Synchronizing
      Interface ID changes between neighbors is possible.\n   However, placing the
      burden on the restarting router to preserve\n   Interface IDs across restarts
      provides for a more robust, more\n   deterministic, and simpler mechanism.  Therefore,
      the OSPFv3\n   Interface ID, as described in section 3.1.2 of [OSPFv3], MUST
      be\n   preserved by the restarting router across restarts.\n   Many implementations
      currently use the interface's MIB-II IfIndex\n   [MIB-INTF] for Interface ID.
      \ The persistence of Interface ID across\n   reboots is described in section
      3.1.5 of [MIB-PERS].\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   [OSPFv3-AUTH] relies on manual key distribution
    which precludes the\n   use of replay protection that utilizes sequence numbers.
    \ The replay\n   of an OSPF Link-Update containing a grace-LSA would allow an
    attacker\n   to deceive neighboring routers into believing that a router that
    has\n   been taken out of service (either intentionally or via a malicious\n   action
    by the same attacker) is still active and is in the process of\n   graceful restart.
    \ However, this attack is much more difficult than\n   the obvious replay of standard
    OSPFv3 hello packets to accomplish the\n   same thing by keeping the adjacency
    up.  Since hello packets are sent\n   more predictably and knowledge of the key
    is not required, the risk\n   added by OSPFv3 graceful restart is insignificant.
    \ Hence, this\n   document does not raise any new security concerns other than
    those\n   covered in [OSPFv3], [OSPFv3-AUTH], and [GRACE].\n"
