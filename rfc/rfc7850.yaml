  - "Abstract\n   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) specification establishes\
    \ a\n   registry of profile names for use by higher-level control protocols,\n\
    \   such as the Session Description Protocol (SDP), to refer to the\n   transport\
    \ methods.  This specification describes the following new\n   SDP transport protocol\
    \ identifiers for transporting RTP Media over\n   TCP: 'TCP/RTP/AVPF', 'TCP/RTP/SAVP',\
    \ 'TCP/RTP/SAVPF',\n   'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVPF', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVP',\
    \ and\n   'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVPF'.\n"

  - "1.  Overview\n   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) provides end-to-end network\n\
    \   transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time\n   data\
    \ such as audio or video over multicast or unicast network\n   services.  The\
    \ data transport is augmented by the RTP Control\n   Protocol (RTCP) to allow\
    \ monitoring of the data delivery in a manner\n   scalable to large multicast\
    \ networks and to provide minimal control\n   and identification functionality.\n\
    \   \"SDP: Session Description Protocol\" [RFC4566] provides a general-\n   purpose\
    \ format for describing multimedia sessions in announcements or\n   invitations.\
    \  \"TCP-Based Media Transport in the Session Description\n   Protocol (SDP)\"\
    \ [RFC4145] specifies a general mechanism for\n   describing media transport over\
    \ TCP using SDP with [RFC4571] defining\n   a method for framing RTP and RTCP\
    \ packets [RFC3550] onto a\n   connection-oriented transport (such as TCP).  \"\
    Connection-Oriented\n   Media Transport over the Transport Layer Security (TLS)\
    \ Protocol in\n   the Session Description Protocol (SDP)\" [RFC4572] extends [RFC4145]\n\
    \   for describing TCP-based media streams that are protected using TLS\n   [RFC5246].\n\
    \   This specification describes additional SDP transport protocol\n   identifiers\
    \ for transporting RTP media over TCP as defined in\n   Section 3.\n"
