  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The IETF policies about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), such\
    \ as\n   patent rights, relative to technologies developed in the IETF are\n \
    \  designed to ensure that IETF working groups and participants have as\n   much\
    \ information about any IPR constraints on a technical proposal as\n   possible.\
    \  The policies are also intended to benefit the Internet\n   community and the\
    \ public at large, while respecting the legitimate\n   rights of IPR holders.\
    \  This memo details the IETF policies\n   concerning IPR related to technology\
    \ worked on within the IETF.  It\n   also describes the objectives that the policies\
    \ are designed to meet.\n   This memo updates RFC 2026 and, with RFC 3978, replaces\
    \ Section 10 of\n   RFC 2026.  This memo also updates paragraph 4 of Section 3.2\
    \ of RFC\n   2028, for all purposes, including reference [2] in RFC 2418.\n"

    \ IETF Contributions in the\n      context of this document.\n   d. \"Internet-Draft\"\
    : temporary documents used in the IETF and RFC\n      Editor processes.  Internet-Drafts\
    \ are posted on the IETF web site\n      by the IETF Secretariat and have a nominal\
    \ maximum lifetime in the\n      Secretariat's public directory of 6 months, after\
    \ which they are\n      removed.  Note that Internet-Drafts are archived many\
    \ places on\n      the Internet, and not all of these places remove expired\n\
    \      Internet-Drafts.  Internet-Drafts that are under active\n      consideration\
    \ by the IESG are not removed from the Secretariat's\n      public directory until\
    \ that consideration is complete.  In\n      addition, the author of an Internet-Draft\
    \ can request that the\n      lifetime in the Secretariat's public directory be\
    \ extended before\n      the expiration.\n   e. \"RFC\": the basic publication\
    \ series for the IETF.  RFCs are\n      published by the RFC Editor and once published\
    \ are never modified.\n      (See [RFC2026] Section 2.1)\n   f. \"RFC Editor Contribution\"\
    : An Internet-Draft intended by the\n      Contributor to be submitted to the\
    \ RFC Editor for publication as\n      an Informational or Experimental RFC but\
    \ not intended to be part\n      of the IETF Standards Process.\n   g. \"IETF\
    \ Internet-Drafts\": Internet-Drafts other than RFC Editor\n      Contributions.\
    \  Note that under Section 3.3(a) the grant of rights\n      in regards to IETF\
    \ Internet-Drafts as specified in this document\n      is perpetual and irrevocable\
    \ and thus survives the Secretariat's\n      removal of an Internet-Draft from\
    \ the public directory, except as\n      limited by Section 3.3(a)(C).  (See [RFC2026]\
    \ Sections 2.2 and 8)\n   h. \"IETF Documents\": RFCs and Internet-Drafts except\
    \ for Internet-\n      Drafts that are RFC Editor Contributions and the RFCs that\
    \ are\n      published from them.\n   i. \"RFC Editor Documents\": RFCs and Internet-Drafts\

    \ from them.\n   j. \"Contribution\": IETF Contributions or RFC Editor Contributions\n\
    \   k. \"Contributor\": an individual submitting a Contribution\n   l. \"Reasonably\
    \ and personally known\": means something an individual\n      knows personally\
    \ or, because of the job the individual holds,\n      would reasonably be expected\
    \ to know.  This wording is used to\n      indicate that an organization cannot\
    \ purposely keep an individual\n      in the dark about patents or patent applications\
    \ just to avoid the\n      disclosure requirement.  But this requirement should\
    \ not be\n      interpreted as requiring the IETF Contributor or participant (or\n\
    \      his or her represented organization, if any) to perform a patent\n    \
    \  search to find applicable IPR.\n   m. \"Implementing Technology\": means a\
    \ technology that implements an\n      IETF specification or standard.\n   n.\
    \ \"Covers\" or \"Covered\" mean that a valid claim of a patent or a\n      patent\
    \ application in any jurisdiction or a protected claim, or\n      any other Intellectual\
    \ Property Right, would necessarily be\n      infringed by the exercise of a right\
    \ (e.g., making, using,\n      selling, importing, distribution, copying, etc.)\
    \ with respect to\n      an Implementing Technology.  For purposes of this definition,\n\
    \      \"valid claim\" means a claim of any unexpired patent or patent\n     \
    \ application which shall not have been withdrawn, cancelled or\n      disclaimed,\
    \ nor held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction\n      in an unappealed\
    \ or unappealable decision.\n   o. \"IPR\" or \"Intellectual Property Rights\"\
    : means patent, copyright,\n      utility model, invention registration, database\
    \ and data rights\n      that may Cover an Implementing Technology, whether such\
    \ rights\n      arise from a registration or renewal thereof, or an application\n\
    \      therefore, in each case anywhere in the world.\n"
- title: 2.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "2.  Introduction\n   In the years since RFC 2026 was published there have been\
    \ a number of\n   times when the exact intent of Section 10, the section which\
    \ deals\n   with IPR disclosures has been the subject of vigorous debate within\n\
    \   the IETF community.  This is because it is becoming increasingly\n   common\
    \ for IETF working groups to have to deal with claims of\n   Intellectual Property\
    \ Rights (IPR), such as patent rights, with\n   regards to technology under discussion\
    \ in working groups.  The aim of\n   this document is to clarify various ambiguities\
    \ in Section 10 of\n   [RFC2026] that led to these debates and to amplify the\
    \ policy in\n   order to clarify what the IETF is, or should be, doing.\n   IPR\
    \ disclosures can come at any point in the IETF Standards Process,\n   e.g., before\
    \ the first Internet-Draft has been submitted, prior to\n   RFC publication, or\
    \ after an RFC has been published and the working\n   group has been closed down;\
    \ they can come from people submitting\n   technical proposals as Internet-Drafts,\
    \ on mailing lists or at\n   meetings, from other people participating in the\
    \ working group or\n   from third parties who find out that the work is going\
    \ or has gone\n   on; and they can be based on granted patents or on patent\n\
    \   applications, and in some cases be disingenuous, i.e., made to affect\n  \
    \ the IETF Standards Process rather than to inform.\n   RFC 2026, Section 10 established\
    \ three basic principles regarding the\n   IETF dealing with claims of Intellectual\
    \ Property Rights:\n   (a) the IETF will make no determination about the validity\
    \ of any\n       particular IPR claim\n   (b) the IETF following normal processes\
    \ can decide to use technology\n       for which IPR disclosures have been made\
    \ if it decides that such\n       a use is warranted\n   (c) in order for the\
    \ working group and the rest of the IETF to have\n       the information needed\
    \ to make an informed decision about the use\n       of a particular technology,\
    \ all those contributing to the working\n       group's discussions must disclose\
    \ the existence of any IPR the\n       Contributor or other IETF participant believes\
    \ Covers or may\n       ultimately Cover the technology under discussion.  This\
    \ applies\n       to both Contributors and other participants, and applies whether\n\
    \       they contribute in person, via email or by other means.  The\n       requirement\
    \ applies to all IPR of the participant, the\n       participant's employer, sponsor,\
    \ or others represented by the\n       participants, that is reasonably and personally\
    \ known to the\n       participant.  No patent search is required.\n   Section\
    \ 1 defines the terms used in this document.  Sections 3, 4 and\n   5 of this\
    \ document address the intellectual property issues\n   previously addressed by\
    \ Section 10 of RFC 2026.  Sections 6 thru 12\n   then explain the rationale for\
    \ these provisions, including some of\n   the clarifications that have been made\
    \ since the adoption of RFC\n   2026.  The rules and procedures set out in this\
    \ document are not\n   intended to modify or alter the IETF's current policy toward\
    \ IPR in\n   the context of the IETF Standards Process.  They are intended to\n\
    \   clarify and fill in procedural gaps.\n   A companion document [RFC3978] deals\
    \ with rights (such as copyrights\n   and trademarks) in Contributions, including\
    \ the right of IETF and its\n   participants to publish and create derivative\
    \ works of those\n   Contributions.  This document is not intended to address\
    \ those\n   issues.\n   This document is not intended as legal advice.  Readers\
    \ are advised\n   to consult their own legal advisors if they would like a legal\n\
    \   interpretation of their rights or the rights of the IETF in any\n   Contributions\
    \ they make.\n"

    \ about licensing of the IPR in\n   case Implementing Technologies require a license.\
    \  Specifically, it\n   is helpful to indicate whether, upon approval by the IESG\
    \ for\n   publication as RFCs of the relevant IETF specification(s), all\n   persons\
    \ will be able to obtain the right to implement, use,\n   distribute and exercise\

- title: 8.  Evaluating Alternative Technologies in IETF Working Groups
  contents:
  - "8.  Evaluating Alternative Technologies in IETF Working Groups\n   In general,\
    \ IETF working groups prefer technologies with no known IPR\n   claims or, for\
    \ technologies with claims against them, an offer of\n   royalty-free licensing.\
    \  But IETF working groups have the discretion\n   to adopt technology with a\
    \ commitment of fair and non-discriminatory\n   terms, or even with no licensing\
    \ commitment, if they feel that this\n   technology is superior enough to alternatives\
    \ with fewer IPR claims\n   or free licensing to outweigh the potential cost of\
    \ the licenses.\n   Over the last few years the IETF has adopted stricter requirements\n\
    \   for some security technologies.  It has become common to have a\n   mandatory-to-implement\
    \ security technology in IETF technology\n   specifications.  This is to ensure\
    \ that there will be at least one\n   common security technology present in all\
    \ implementations of such a\n   specification that can be used in all cases. \
    \ This does not limit the\n   specification from including other security technologies,\
    \ the use of\n   which could be negotiated between implementations.  An IETF consensus\n\
    \   has developed that no mandatory-to-implement security technology can\n   be\
    \ specified in an IETF specification unless it has no known IPR\n   claims against\
    \ it or a royalty-free license is available to\n   implementers of the specification\
    \ unless there is a very good reason\n   to do so.  This limitation does not extend\
    \ to other security\n   technologies in the same specification if they are not\
    \ listed as\n   mandatory-to-implement.\n   It should also be noted that the absence\
    \ of IPR disclosures is not\n   the same thing as the knowledge that there will\
    \ be no IPR claims in\n   the future.  People or organizations not currently involved\
    \ in the\n   IETF or people or organizations that discover IPR they feel to be\n\
    \   relevant in their patent portfolios can make IPR disclosures at any\n   time.\n\
    \   It should also be noted that the validity and enforceability of any\n   IPR\
    \ may be challenged for legitimate reasons, and the mere existence\n   of an IPR\
    \ disclosure should not automatically be taken to mean that\n   the disclosed\
    \ IPR is valid or enforceable.  Although the IETF can\n   make no actual determination\
    \ of validity, enforceability or\n   applicability of any particular IPR claim,\
    \ it is reasonable that a\n   working group will take into account on their own\
    \ opinions of the\n   validity, enforceability or applicability of Intellectual\
    \ Property\n   Rights in their evaluation of alternative technologies.\n"

    \ \"change control\").  The implementation of an\n   agreement between the IETF\
