  - "1.  Purpose\n   To help assure healthcare privacy and security in automated systems,\n\
    \   usage data needs to be collected.  This data will be reviewed by\n   administrative\
    \ staff to verify that healthcare data is being used in\n   accordance with the\
    \ healthcare provider's data security requirements\n   and to establish accountability\
    \ for data use.  This data collection\n   and review process is called security\
    \ auditing.\n   This document defines the format of the data to be collected and\n\
    \   minimum set of attributes that need to be captured by healthcare\n   application\
    \ systems for subsequent use by an automation-assisted\n   review application.\
    \  The data includes records of who accessed\n   healthcare data, when, for what\
    \ action, from where, and which\n   patients' records were involved.  The data\
    \ definition is an XML\n   schema to be used as a reference by healthcare standards\
    \ developers\n   and application designers.\n   This document consolidates previously\
    \ disjointed viewpoints of\n   security auditing from Health Level 7 (HL7) [HL7SASIG],\
    \ Digital\n   Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Working Group 14,\n\
    \   Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) [IHETF-3], the ASTM\n   International\
    \ Healthcare Informatics Technical Committee (ASTM E31)\n   [E2147], and the Joint\
    \ NEMA/COCIR/JIRA Security and Privacy Committee\n   [NEMASPC].  It is intended\
    \ as a reference for these groups and other\n   healthcare standards developers.\n\
    \   The purposes the document fulfills are to:\n   1) Define data to be communicated\
    \ for evidence of compliance with, or\n      violations of, a healthcare enterprise's\
    \ security and privacy\n      policies and objectives.\n      This document defines\
    \ the audit message format and content for\n      healthcare application systems.\
    \  The focus of auditing is to\n      retrospectively detect and report security/privacy\
    \ breaches.  This\n      includes capturing data that supports individual accountability\n\
    \      for patient record creation, access, updates, and deletions.\n      This\
    \ document does not define healthcare security and privacy\n      policies or\
    \ objectives.  It also does not include real-time access\n      alarm actions\
    \ since there is a perception in the healthcare\n      community that security\
    \ measures that inhibit access may also\n      inhibit effective patient care,\
    \ under some circumstances.\n   2) Depict the data that would potentially reside\
    \ in a common audit\n      engine or database.\n      Privacy and security audit\
    \ data is to be collected on each\n      hardware system, and there are likely\
    \ to be separate local data\n      stores for system-level and application-level\
    \ audits.  Collating\n      these records and providing a common view - transcending\
    \ hardware\n      system boundaries - is seen as necessary for cost-effective\n\
    \      security and privacy policy administration.\n      The data definitions\
    \ in this document support such a collation,\n      but the technical implementation\
    \ alternatives are not covered in\n      this document.\n   3) Depict data that\
    \ allows useful queries against audited events.\n      Audit data, in its raw\
    \ form, reflects a sequential view of system\n      activity.  Useful inquiries\
    \ for security and privacy\n      administration need workflow, business process,\
    \ organizational,\n      role, and person-oriented views.  Data definitions in\
    \ this\n      document anticipate and support creating those views and queries,\n\
    \      but do not define them.\n   4) Provide a common reference standard for\
    \ healthcare IT standards\n      development organizations.\n      By specifying\
    \ an XML schema, this document anticipates extensions\n      to the base schema\
    \ to meet requirements of healthcare standards\n      bodies and application developers.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Data Collection\n   This document specifies audit data to be collected\
    \ and communicated\n   from automated systems.  It does not include non-automated\
    \ processes.\n   Data for events in the above categories may be selectively collected,\n\
    \   based on healthcare organization policy.  This document does not\n   specify\
    \ any baseline or minimal policies.\n   For each audited event, this document\
    \ specifies the minimal data\n   requirements plus optional data for the following\
    \ event categories:\n   1) Security administrative events - establishing and maintaining\n\
    \      security policy definitions, secured object definitions, role\n      definitions,\
    \ user definitions, and the relationships among them.\n      In general, these\
    \ events are specific to the administrative\n      applications.\n   2) Audit\
    \ access events - reflecting special protections implemented\n      for the audit\
    \ trail itself.\n   3) Security-mediated events - recording entity identification\
    \ and\n      authentication, data access, function access, nonrepudiation,\n \
    \     cryptographic operations, and data import/export for messages and\n    \
    \  reports.  In general, these events are generic to all protected\n      resources,\
    \ without regard to the application data content.\n   4) Patient care data events\
    \ - documenting what was done, by whom,\n      using which resources, from what\
    \ access points, and to whose\n      medical data.  In general, these audits are\
    \ application-specific\n      since they require knowledge of the application\
    \ data content.\n   Security subsystems found in most system infrastructures include\
    \ a\n   capability to capture system-level security relevant events like\n   log-on\
    \ and security object accesses.  This document does not preclude\n   such functions\
    \ being enabled to record and supply the data defined in\n   this document, but\
    \ transformation of the collected data to the common\n   XML schema definition\
    \ may be necessary to support requirements\n   consolidated auditing views.\n\
    \   Application-level events, such as patient record access, are not\n   captured\
    \ by system-level security audits.  The defined data support\n   applications'\
    \ record access auditing for healthcare institutional\n   security and privacy\
    \ assurance plus related policy administration\n   functions.\n   System-local\
    \ data definitions for collection and storage of audit\n   data, prior to transformation\
    \ to a common schema and transmission to\n   a common repository, are not included\
    \ in this document.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Anticipated Data End-uses
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Anticipated Data End-uses\n   This document anticipates, but does not define,\
    \ end-uses for the data\n   collected.\n   The typical healthcare IT environment\
    \ contains many systems from\n   various vendors and developers who have not implemented\
    \ common or\n   interoperable security administrative functions.  This document\n\
    \   anticipates a requirement to transmit data from several unrelated\n   systems\
    \ to a common repository.  It also anticipates the aggregated\n   data which may\
    \ then be queried and viewed in a variety of ways.\n   There are distinctions\
    \ of detail granularity, specificity, and\n   frequency between audit data required\
    \ for surveillance versus\n   forensic purposes.  While some surveillance data\
    \ may be useful for\n   forensics, the scope of this document is limited to surveillance.\n\
    \   This document does not address access real-time policy violation\n   alarm\
    \ actions.  There is a perception in the healthcare community\n   that security\
    \ measures which inhibit access may also inhibit\n   effective patient care, under\
    \ some circumstances.\n   This document does not define any data for patient care\
    \ consents or\n   patients' permissions for data disclosure.  It is conceivable\
    \ that\n   the proposed audit data could be input to such applications, however,\n\
    \   assuming strict access controls for audit data have been established.\n  \
    \ This document does not define system-specific or application-specific\n   data\
    \ that may be collected and reported in addition to the defined\n   elements.\
    \  For example, it is conceivable that audit mechanisms may\n   be useful for\
    \ tracking financial or payroll transactions.  At the\n   same time, this document\
    \ does not preclude extending the XML schema\n   to incorporate additional data.\n\
    \   There is a potential requirement for a set of administrative messages\n  \
    \ to be sent from a central source to each participating system to\n   uniformly\
    \ specify, control, enable, or disable audit data collection.\n   Such messages\
    \ are not included in this document.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Effective Data Gathering
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Effective Data Gathering\n   The process of assuring that security policies\
    \ are implemented\n   correctly is essential to information security administration.\
    \  It is\n   a set of interrelated tasks all aimed at maintaining an acceptable\n\
    \   level of confidence that security protections are, in fact, working\n   as\
    \ intended.  These tasks are assisted by data from automated\n   instrumentation\
    \ of system and application functions.\n   Data gathered from a secured environment\
    \ is used to accumulate\n   evidence that security systems are working as intended\
    \ and to detect\n   incidents and patterns of misuse for further actions.  Once\
    \ messages\n   have been collected, various reports may be created in support\
    \ of\n   security assurance and administration information requirements.\n   When\
    \ a site runs multiple heterogeneous applications, each\n   application system\
    \ may have its own security mechanisms - user log-\n   on, roles, access right\
    \ permissions and restrictions, etc.  Each\n   application system also has its\
    \ own security log file that records\n   security relevant events, e.g., log-in,\
    \ data access, and updates to\n   the security policy databases.  A system administrator\
    \ or security\n   auditor must examine each of these log files to find security\n\
    \   relevant incidents.  Not only is it difficult to examine each of\n   these\
    \ files separately, the format and contents of each file may be\n   confusingly\
    \ different.\n   Resolving these issues requires a framework to:\n   -  Maximize\
    \ interoperability and the meaningfulness of data across\n      applications and\
    \ sites\n   -  Minimize ambiguity among heterogeneous systems\n   -  Simplify\
    \ and limit the costs of administrative audit tasks.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Efficiency
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Efficiency\n   One of the leading concerns about auditing is the potential\
    \ volume of\n   data gathering and its impact on application system performance.\n\
    \   Although this document does not prescribe specific implementations or\n  \
    \ strategies, the following are meant as informative guidance for\n   development.\n\
    \   1) Audits should be created for transactions or record-level data\n      access,\
    \ not for individual attribute-level changes to data.\n   2) This document does\
    \ not discourage locally optimized gathering of\n      audit data on each application\
    \ system.  Instead, it anticipates\n      implementation-defined periodic gathering\
    \ and transmission of data\n      to a common repository.  This common repository\
    \ would be optimized\n      for after-the-fact audit queries and reporting, thus\
    \ unburdening\n      each application system of those responsibilities.  It is\
    \ also\n      important to keep the message size compact so that audit data will\n\
    \      not penalize normal network operation.\n   3) On each application system,\
    \ a variety of policy-based methods\n      could be employed to optimize data\
    \ gathering and storage, e.g.,\n      selective auditing of only events defined\
    \ as important plus\n      workload buffering and balancing.  Data gathering itself\
    \ should be\n      stateless to avoid the overhead of transactional semantics.\
    \  In\n      addition, prior to transmission, some filtering, aggregation, and\n\
    \      summarization of repeated events would reduce the number of\n      messages.\
    \  Audit data storage and integrity on each application\n      system need only\
    \ be scaled for relatively low-volume and short-\n      duration requirements,\
    \ yet be consistent with implementation-\n      defined minimums for holding the\
    \ data for subsequent collection.\n   4) Leveraging existing data collection should\
    \ be considered.  For\n      example, most commercial security subsystems record\
    \ events in a\n      local common log file, so the log file data can be extracted\
    \ for\n      communication to a common repository.  Also, it is common in some\n\
    \      systems' designs to have a transaction log for data reconstruction\n  \
    \    in event of database loss, so collecting data-update audit data\n      within\
    \ this subsystem could reduce impact on application system\n      performance.\n\
    \   5) A security audit repository would gather all audit message data\n     \
    \ from the different applications in one database with one standard\n      structure.\
    \  This would allow easier evaluation and querying.  Once\n      a suspicious\
    \ pattern has been found in the audit log repository,\n      investigation might\
    \ proceed with more detail in the application\n      specific audit log.  The\
    \ presence of a common repository also\n      simplifies and streamlines the implementation\
    \ of policies for\n      audit data storage, integrity, retention, and destruction.\n"

  - "6.2.  XML Schema Localization\n   The schema specified in section 6.1 may be\
    \ extended and restricted to\n   meet local implementation-specific requirements.\
    \  W3C Recommendation\n   for XML Schema structure [W3CXML-1], section 4, is the\
    \ governing\n   standard for accomplishing this.\n   As of the current version\
    \ of this document, a public reference URI\n   for the base schema has not been\
    \ established.\n   Local definitions reference the common audit message base schema.\n\
    \   For example, here is a schema with a local vocabulary restriction for\n  \
    \ \"Audit Enterprise Site ID\" plus an extension adding a new \"Audit\n   Source\
    \ Asset Number\" element.\n   The URI used to identify this schema (http://audit-message-uri)\
    \ is a\n   syntactically valid example that does not represent an actual schema.\n\
    \   Schema validators might report an error when attempting to import a\n   schema\

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Audit data must be secured at least to the same\
    \ extent as the\n   underlying data and activities being audited.  This includes\
    \ access\n   controls as well as data integrity and recovery functions.  This\n\
    \   document acknowledges the need for, but does not specify, the\n   policies\
    \ and technical methods to accomplish this.\n   It is conceivable that audit data\
    \ might have unintended uses, e.g.,\n   tracking the frequency and nature of system\
    \ use for productivity\n   measures.  ASTM standard E2147-01 [E2147] states, in\
    \ paragraph\n   5.3.10, \"Prohibit use for other reasons than to enforce security\
    \ and\n   to detect security breaches in record health information systems, for\n\
    \   example, the audits are not to be used to explore activity profiles\n   or\
    \ movement profiles of employees.\"\n   Some audit data arises from security-relevant\
    \ processes other than\n   data access.  These are the trigger events listed in\
    \ section 4.1 and\n   4.2 of this document.  Audit data, defined in this document,\
    \ can\n   record the accountabilities for the results of these processes, as\n\
    \   part of a complete security implementation.  A discussion of the\n   associated\
    \ authorities, reference standards, and implementation\n   technology choices\
    \ for the processes is outside the scope of this\n   document.\n"
