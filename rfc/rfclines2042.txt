This document describes the process for creating new BGP attribute type codes.
Basic attribute type codes are described in RFC 1771, pages 12 through 15.
These, and new attribute type codes that are used in the Internet are registered with the IANA.
The actual process will involve the documentation of such attribute type codes in an RFC.
There is no intention of segmenting the code space into public/private or IP/OSI or any other sectioning.
As each attribute type code is in the process of being developed, it will use an octet value of 255, which will be reserved for this use.
At the time an attribute type code is assigned a number by the IANA, the documetnation and code base will be updated to reflect the authorized attribute type code value.
IANA maintained values will be published in the periodically updated Assigned Numbers RFC [6].
Requests for assignment of a new attribute type code should be sent to the IANA (IANA@IANA.ORG) with a subject that includes the phrase "BGP Attribute Type".
Currently in use attribute type codes are listed below:
