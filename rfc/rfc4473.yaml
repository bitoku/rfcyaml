- title: 1.1.  Background and Motivation
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Background and Motivation\n   For some ten years, multicast-based (multimedia)\
    \ conferences\n   (including IETF working group sessions) as well as broadcasts\
    \ of\n   lectures/seminars, concerts, and other events have been used in the\n\
    \   Internet, more precisely, on the MBONE.  Schedules and descriptions\n   for\
    \ such multimedia sessions as well as the transport addresses,\n   codecs, and\
    \ their parameters have been described using the Session\n   Description Protocol\
    \ (SDP) [2] as a rudimentary (but as of then\n   largely sufficient) means.  Descriptions\
    \ have been disseminated using\n   the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) [3]\
    \ and Session Directory\n   Tools such as SD [4] or SDR [5]; descriptions have\
    \ also been put up\n   on web pages, sent by electronic mail, etc.\n   Recently,\
    \ interest has grown to expand -- or better: to generalize --\n   the applicability\
    \ of these kinds of session descriptions.\n   Descriptions are becoming more elaborate\
    \ in terms of included\n   metadata, more generic regarding the types of media\
    \ sessions, and\n   possibly also support other transports than just IP (e.g.,\
    \ legacy TV\n   channel addresses).  This peers well with the DVB (Digital Video\n\
    \   Broadcasting) [6] Organization's increased activities towards IP-\n   based\
    \ communications over satellite, cable, and terrestrial radio\n   networks, also\
    \ considering IP as the basis for TV broadcasts and\n   further services.  The\
    \ program/content descriptions are referred to\n   as Internet Media Guides (IMGs)\
    \ and can be viewed as a generalization\n   of Electronic Program Guides (EPGs)\
    \ and multimedia session\n   descriptions.\n   An Internet Media Guide (IMG) has\
    \ a structured collection of\n   multimedia session descriptions expressed using\
    \ SDP, SDPng [7], or\n   some similar session description format.  This is used\
    \ to describe a\n   set of multimedia services (e.g., television program schedules,\n\
    \   content delivery schedules) but may also refer to other networked\n   resources\
    \ including web pages.  IMGs provide the envelope for\n   metadata formats and\
    \ session descriptions defined elsewhere with the\n   aim of facilitating structuring,\
    \ versioning, referencing,\n   distributing, and maintaining (caching, updating)\
    \ such information.\n   The IMG metadata may be delivered to a potentially large\
    \ audience,\n   who uses it to join a subset of the sessions described, and who\
    \ may\n   need to be notified of changes to this information.  Hence, a\n   framework\
    \ for distributing IMG metadata in various different ways is\n   needed to accommodate\
    \ the needs of different audiences: For\n   traditional broadcast-style scenarios,\
    \ multicast-based (push)\n   distribution of IMG metadata needs to be supported.\
    \  Where no\n   multicast is available, unicast-based push is required, too.\n\
    \   Furthermore, IMG metadata may need to be retrieved interactively,\n   similar\
    \ to web pages (e.g., after rebooting a system or when a user\n   is browsing\
    \ after network connectivity has been re-established).\n   Finally, IMG metadata\
    \ may be updated as time elapses because content\n   described in the guide may\
    \ be changed: for example, the airtime of an\n   event such as a concert or sports\
    \ event may change, possibly\n   affecting the airtime of subsequent media.  This\
    \ may be done by\n   polling the IMG sender as well as by asynchronous change\n\
    \   notifications.\n   Furthermore, any Internet host can be a sender of content\
    \ and thus an\n   IMG sender.  Some of the content sources and sinks may only\
    \ be\n   connected to the Internet sporadically.  Also, a single human user\n\
    \   may use many different devices to access metadata.  Thus, we envision\n  \
    \ that IMG metadata can be sent and received by, among others, cellular\n   phones,\
    \ Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), personal computers,\n   streaming video\
    \ servers, set-top boxes, video cameras, and Digital\n   Video Recorders (DVRs),\
    \ and that the data be carried across arbitrary\n   types of link layers, including\
    \ bandwidth-constrained mobile\n   networks.  However, generally we expect IMG\
    \ senders to be well-\n   connected hosts.\n   Finally, with many potential senders\
    \ and receivers, different types\n   of networks, and presumably numerous service\
    \ providers, IMG metadata\n   may need to be combined, split, filtered, augmented,\
    \ modified, etc.,\n   on their way from the sender(s) to the receiver(s) to provide\
    \ the\n   ultimate user with a suitable selection of multimedia services\n   according\
    \ to her preferences, subscriptions, location, and context\n   (e.g., devices,\
    \ access networks).\n"

  - "1.2.  Scope of This Document\n   This document defines requirements that Internet\
    \ Media Guide\n   mechanisms must satisfy in order to deliver IMG metadata to\
    \ a\n   potentially large audience.  Since IMGs can describe many kinds of\n \
    \  multimedia content, IMG methods are generally applicable to several\n   scenarios.\n\
    \   In considering wide applicability, this document provides the problem\n  \
    \ statement and discusses existing mechanisms in this area.  Then\n   several\
    \ use case scenarios for IMGs are explained including\n   descriptions of how\
    \ IMG metadata and IMG delivery mechanisms\n   contribute to these scenarios.\
    \  Following this, this document\n   provides general requirements that are independent\
    \ of any transport\n   layer mechanism and application, such as delivery properties,\n\
    \   reliability, and IMG descriptions.\n   This document reflects investigating\
    \ work on delivery mechanisms for\n   IMGs and generalizing work on session announcement\
    \ and initiation\n   protocols, especially in the field of the MMUSIC working\
    \ group (SAP,\n   SIP [8], SDP).\n"

- title: 2.1.  New Terms
  contents:
  - "2.1.  New Terms\n   Internet Media Guide (IMG): IMG is a generic term used to\
    \ describe\n         the formation, delivery, and use of IMG metadata.  The\n\
    \         definition of the IMG is intentionally left imprecise.\n   IMG Element:\
    \ The smallest atomic element of metadata that can be\n         transmitted separately\
    \ by IMG operations and referenced\n         individually from other IMG elements.\n\
    \   IMG Metadata: A set of metadata consisting of one or more IMG\n         elements.\
    \  IMG metadata describes the features of multimedia\n         content used to\
    \ enable selection of and access to media\n         sessions containing content.\
    \  For example, metadata may consist\n         of the URI, title, airtime, bandwidth\
    \ needed, file size, text\n         summary, genre, and access restrictions.\n\
    \   IMG Delivery: The process of exchanging IMG metadata in terms of both\n  \
    \       large-scale and atomic data transfers.\n   IMG Sender: An IMG sender is\
    \ a logical entity that sends IMG metadata\n         to one or more IMG receivers.\n\
    \   IMG Receiver: An IMG receiver is a logical entity that receives IMG\n    \
    \     metadata from an IMG sender.\n   IMG Transceiver: An IMG transceiver combines\
    \ an IMG receiver and\n         sender.  It may modify received IMG metadata or\
    \ merge IMG\n         metadata received from several different IMG senders.\n\
    \   IMG Operation: An atomic operation of an IMG transport protocol, used\n  \
    \       between IMG sender(s) and IMG receiver(s) for the delivery of\n      \
    \   IMG metadata and for the control of IMG sender(s)/receiver(s).\n   IMG Transport\
    \ Protocol: A protocol that transports IMG metadata from\n         an IMG sender\
    \ to IMG receiver(s).\n   IMG Transport Session: An association between an IMG\
    \ sender and one\n         or more IMG receivers within the scope of an IMG transport\n\
    \         protocol.  An IMG transport session involves a time-bound\n        \
    \ series of IMG transport protocol interactions that provide\n         delivery\
    \ of IMG metadata from the IMG sender to the IMG\n         receiver(s).\n"
- title: 3.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "3.  Problem Statement\n   As we enumerate the requirements for IMGs, it will\
    \ become clear that\n   they are not fully addressed by the existing protocols.\
    \  The\n   \"Framework for the Usage of Internet Media Guides\" [9] discusses\n\
    \   about these issues in more detail.\n   The MMUSIC working group has long been\
    \ investigating content, media\n   and service information delivery mechanisms,\
    \ and protocols, and has\n   itself produced the Session Announcement Protocol\
    \ (SAP), the Session\n   Description Protocol (SDP), and the Session Initiation\
    \ Protocol\n   (SIP).  SDP is capable of describing multimedia sessions (i.e.,\n\
    \   content in a wider sense) by means of limited descriptive information\n  \
    \ intended for human perception plus transport, scheduling information,\n   and\
    \ codecs and addresses for setting up media sessions.  SIP and SAP\n   are protocols\
    \ to distribute these session descriptions.\n   However, we perceive a lack of\
    \ a standard solution for scalable IMG\n   delivery mechanism in the number of\
    \ receivers with consistency of IMG\n   metadata between an IMG sender and IMG\
    \ receiver for both bi-\n   directional and unidirectional transport.  With increased\
    \ service\n   dynamics and complexity, there is an increased requirement for\n\
    \   updates to these content descriptions.\n   HTTP [10] is a well-known information\
    \ retrieval protocol using bi-\n   directional transport and is widely used to\
    \ deliver web-based content\n   descriptions to many hosts.  However, it has well-recognized\n\
    \   limitations of scalability in the number of HTTP clients since it\n   relies\
    \ on the polling mechanism to keep information consistent\n   between the server\
    \ and client.\n   SAP [3] is an announcement protocol that distributes session\n\
    \   descriptions via multicast.  It does not support prioritization or\n   fine-grained\
    \ metadata selection and update notifications, as it\n   places restrictions on\
    \ metadata payload size and always sends the\n   whole metadata.  It requires\
    \ a wide-area multicast infrastructure for\n   it to be deployable beyond a local\
    \ area network.\n   SIP [8] and SIP-specific event notifications [11] can be used\
    \ to\n   notify subscribers of the update of IMG metadata for bi-directional\n\
    \   transport.  However, it is necessary to define an event package for\n   IMGs.\n\
    \   We also perceive a lack of standard solution for flexible content\n   descriptions\
    \ to support a multitude of application-specific metadata\n   and associated data\
    \ models with a different amount of detail and\n   different target audiences.\n\
    \   SDP [2] has a text-encoded syntax to specify multimedia sessions for\n   announcements\
    \ and invitations.  It is primarily intended to describe\n   client capability\
    \ requirements and enable client application\n   selection.  Although SDP is extensible,\
    \ it has limitations such as\n   structured extensibility and capability to reference\
    \ properties of a\n   multimedia session from the description of another session.\n\
    \   These can mostly be overcome by the XML-based SDPng [7] -- which is\n   intended\
    \ for both two-way negotiation and unidirectional delivery --\n   or similar content\
    \ description mechanisms.  Since SDPng addresses\n   multiparty multimedia conferences,\
    \ it would be necessary to extend\n   the XML schema in order to describe general\
    \ multimedia content.\n"

- title: 4.1.1.  IP Datacast to a Wireless Receiver
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  IP Datacast to a Wireless Receiver\n   IP Datacast is the delivery of\
    \ IP-based services over broadcast\n   radio.  Internet content delivery is therefore\
    \ unidirectional in this\n   case.  However, there can be significant benefits\
    \ from being able to\n   provide rich media one-to-many services to such receivers.\n\
    \   There are two main classes of receiver in this use case: fixed\n   mains-powered\
    \ and mobile battery-powered.  Both of these are affected\n   by radio phenomena\
    \ and so robust, or error-resilient, delivery is\n   important.  Carouselled metadata\
    \ transfer (cyclically repeated with a\n   fixed bandwidth) provides a base level\
    \ of robustness for an IP\n   datacast-based announcement system, although the\
    \ design of\n   carouselled transfer should enable battery-powered receivers to\
    \ go\n   through periods of sleep to extend their operational time between\n \
    \  charges.  Insertion of Forward Error Correction (FEC) data into\n   metadata\
    \ announcements improves error resilience, and reordering\n   (interleaving) data\
    \ blocks further increases tolerance to burst\n   errors.\n   To enable receivers\
    \ to more accurately specify the metadata they are\n   interested in, the unidirectional\
    \ delivery may be distributed between\n   several logical channels.  This is so\
    \ that a receiver needs only\n   access the channels of interest and thus can\
    \ reduce the amount of\n   time, storage, and CPU resources needed for processing\
    \ the IP data.\n   Also, hierarchical channels enable receivers to subscribe to\
    \ a\n   (possibly well-known) root multicast channel/group and progressively\n\
    \   access only those additional channels based on metadata in parent\n   channels.\n\
    \   In some cases, the receiver may have multiple access interfaces\n   adding\
    \ bi-directional communications capability.  This enables a\n   multitude of options,\
    \ but most important, it enables NACK-based\n   reliability and the individual\
    \ retrieval of missed or not-multicast\n   sets of metadata.\n   Thus, essential\
    \ IMG features in this case include the following:\n   robust unidirectional delivery\
    \ (with optional levels of reliability\n   including \"plug-in FEC\" supported\
    \ by a transport layer protocol),\n   which implies easily identifiable segmentation\
    \ of delivery data to\n   make FEC, carousel, interleaving, and other schemes\
    \ possible;\n   effective identification of metadata sets (probably uniquely)\
    \ to\n   enable more efficient use of multicast and unicast retrieval over\n \
    \  multiple access systems regardless of the parts of metadata and\n   application-specific\
    \ extensions in use; and prioritization of\n   metadata, which can (for instance)\
    \ be achieved by spreading it\n   between channels and allocating/distributing\
    \ bandwidth accordingly.\n   Furthermore, some cases require IMG metadata authentication\
    \ and some\n   group security/encryption and supporting security message exchanges\n\
    \   (out of band from the IMG multicast sessions).\n"
- title: 4.1.2.  Regular Fixed Dial-up Internet Connection
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  Regular Fixed Dial-up Internet Connection\n   Dial-up connections tend\
    \ to be reasonably slow (<56 kbps in any\n   case), and thus large data transfers\
    \ are less feasible, especially\n   during an active application session (such\
    \ as a file transfer\n   described by IMG metadata).  They can also be intermittent,\n\
    \   especially if a user is paying for the connected time, or connected\n   through\
    \ a less reliable exchange.  Thus, this favors locally stored\n   IMG metadata\
    \ over web-based browsing, especially where parts of the\n   metadata change infrequently.\
    \  There may be no service provider\n   preference over unicast and multicast\
    \ transport for small and medium\n   numbers of users as the last-mile dial-up\
    \ connection limits per-user\n   congestion, and a user may prefer the more reliable\
    \ option (unicast\n   unless reliable multicast is provided).\n"
- title: 4.1.3.  Broadband Always-on Fixed Internet Connection
  contents:
  - "4.1.3.  Broadband Always-on Fixed Internet Connection\n   Typically, bandwidth\
    \ is less of an issue to a broadband user and\n   unicast transport, such as using\
    \ query-response methods, may be\n   typical for a PC user.  If a system were\
    \ only used in this context,\n   with content providers, ISPs, and users having\
    \ no other requirements,\n   then web-based browsing may be equally suitable.\
    \  However, broadband\n   users sharing a local area network, especially wireless,\
    \ may benefit\n   more from local storage features than on-line browsing, especially\
    \ if\n   they have intermittent Internet access.\n   Some services on broadband,\
    \ such as live media broadcasting, benefit\n   from multicast transport for streaming\
    \ media because of scalability.\n   In the cases where multicast transport is\
    \ already available, it is\n   convenient for a sender and receiver to retrieve\
    \ IMG metadata over\n   multicast transport.  Thus, broadband users may be forced\
    \ to retrieve\n   IMG metadata over multicast if backbone operators require this\
    \ to\n   keep system-wide bandwidth usage feasible.\n"

    \ provide an\n   understanding of the scope and type of IMG usage.  Many more\
    \ examples\n   may be relevant, for instance, those detailed in [12].  There are\n\

    \ TV and radio\n   programs and segments within those programs.  IMG metadata\

    \ sent to user terminals.  Different transport modes or even\n   different access\

  contents:
  - "4.2.5.  File Distribution\n   IMGs support the communication of file delivery\
    \ session properties,\n   enabling the scheduled delivery or synchronization of\
    \ files between a\n   number of hosts.  The received IMG metadata could be subsequently\n\
    \   used by any application (also outside the scope of IMGs), for\n   example,\
    \ to download a file with a software update.  IMG metadata can\n   provide a description\
    \ to each file in a file delivery session,\n   assisting users or receiving software\
    \ in selecting individual files\n   for reception.\n   For example, when a content\
    \ provider wants to distribute a large\n   amount of data in file format to thousands\
    \ of clients, the content\n   provider can use IMG metadata to schedule the delivery\
    \ effectively.\n   Since IMG metadata can describe time-related data for each\
    \ receiver,\n   the content provider can schedule delivery time for each receiver.\n\
    \   This can save network bandwidth and delivery capacity of senders.  In\n  \
    \ addition, IMG metadata can be used to consistency check, and thus\n   synchronize,\
    \ a set of files between a sender host and receiver host,\n   when those files\
    \ change as time elapses.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.6.  Coming-release and Pre-released Content\n   IMG metadata can be used\
    \ to describe items of content before the\n   details of their final release are\
    \ known.  A user may be interested\n   in coming content (a new movie or software\
    \ title where some aspects\n   of the content description are known in advance)\
    \ and so subscribe to\n   an information service that notifies the user of changes\
    \ to metadata\n   describing that content.  Thus, as the coming release (or pre-\n\
    \   releases, e.g., as movie trailers or software demos) become\n   available,\
    \ the IMG metadata changes and the user is notified of this\n   change.  For example,\
    \ the user could see an announcement of a movie\n   that will be released sometime\
    \ in the next few months, and configure\n   the user's terminal to receive and\

    \ appropriate age group, etc.) and configuration.\n   The IMG receiver might send\
    \ its preferences in the IMG operations\n   that can specify user-specific IMG\
    \ metadata to be delivered.  These\n   preferences could consist of filtering\

    \ It is\n   typically useful in unicast cases and also beneficial in multicast\n\

    \   Either the IMG sender can simply make updates available\n   (unsynchronized),\

    \ metadata\n   is necessary to control consistency when the IMG sender or receiver\n\
    \   could not communicate for a while.  In this case, the IMG sender or\n   receiver\
    \ may need to confirm its consistency by IMG operations.\n   REQ REL-2: Since\
