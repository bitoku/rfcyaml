- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   In most presentations, significant information is conveyed\
    \ through\n   the use of viewgraphs and a pointer. This makes accurate transmission\n\
    \   of them vital in remote conferencing applications. Using regular\n   video\
    \ of a presenter's display for this purpose is problematic\n   because, while\
    \ the viewgraphs require a high spatial resolution, the\n   pointer movements\
    \ need to be sampled and transmitted at a high\n   temporal resolution so that\
    \ the presenter's pointing actions can be\n   displayed synchronously with the\
    \ corresponding audio and video\n   signals. In many instances, this synchronization\
    \ carries vital\n   information.  As an example, consider a speaker pointing at\
    \ two\n   alternatives on a viewgraph in sequence and saying \"this one is\n \
    \  better than this\".  To satisfy both high spatial and high temporal\n   resolution\
    \ requirements, at least S-VHS quality video may need to be\n   used. Codecs that\
    \ can compress S-VHS video effectively in real-time\n   are expensive for this\
    \ purpose, and transmitting such video\n   uncompressed requires very high bandwidths.\n\
    \   A much simpler and economical system can be designed by capturing and\n  \
    \ transmitting the pointer coordinates separately [2]. The pointer\n   coordinates\
    \ with respect to a displayed viewgraph can easily be\n   obtained in electronic\
    \ presentation systems. For presentations\n   prepared for optical systems, such\
    \ as transparencies for overhead\n   projectors, an arrangement where the viewgraph\
    \ is captured in a frame\n   buffer on a computer can be used to associate the\
    \ pointer coordinates\n   with the displayed viewgraph. For capturing transparencies,\
    \ printed\n   material, or even three dimensional objects, a document camera and\
    \ a\n   personal computer or workstation based video capture card can be\n   used.\
    \  This arrangement can handle electronic viewgraphs by feeding\n   the video\
    \ output of the computer that displays them to the video\n   capture card through\
    \ an appropriate converter also. A side benefit of\n   this is that it allows\
    \ using a presenter's own computer to transmit\n   electronic viewgraphs without\
    \ connecting it to, for example, an\n   intranet. The captured image is then displayed\
    \ along with the\n   capturing computer's mouse pointer on the presenter's display\
    \ using a\n   projector. The presenter moves the pointer on the display using\
    \ a\n   regular or maybe a wireless mouse whose location can easily be\n   captured\
    \ by appropriate software running on the capturing computer.\n   This document\
    \ describes an RTP payload format to transmit the pointer\n   coordinates captured\
    \ in one of the ways described above using RTP.\n   Although, a mouse can be used\
    \ as the pointer, this payload format is\n   not intended and may not have all\
    \ functionalities needed to implement\n   a  general mouse event transmission\
    \ mechanism.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [3].\n"
