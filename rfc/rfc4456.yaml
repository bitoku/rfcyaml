  - "Abstract\n   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an inter-autonomous system\n\
    \   routing protocol designed for TCP/IP internets.  Typically, all BGP\n   speakers\
    \ within a single AS must be fully meshed so that any external\n   routing information\
    \ must be re-distributed to all other routers\n   within that Autonomous System\

    \ with several\n   alternatives proposed.\n   This document describes the use\
    \ and design of a method known as\n   \"route reflection\" to alleviate the need\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Typically, all BGP speakers within a single AS must be fully\
    \ meshed\n   and any external routing information must be re-distributed to all\n\
    \   other routers within that AS.  For n BGP speakers within an AS that\n   requires\
    \ to maintain n*(n-1)/2 unique Internal BGP (IBGP) sessions.\n   This \"full mesh\"\
    \ requirement clearly does not scale when there are a\n   large number of IBGP\
    \ speakers each exchanging a large volume of\n   routing information, as is common\
    \ in many of today's networks.\n   This scaling problem has been well documented,\
    \ and a number of\n   proposals have been made to alleviate this [2,3].  This\
    \ document\n   represents another alternative in alleviating the need for a \"\
    full\n   mesh\" and is known as \"route reflection\".  This approach allows a\
    \ BGP\n   speaker (known as a \"route reflector\") to advertise IBGP learned\n\
    \   routes to certain IBGP peers.  It represents a change in the commonly\n  \

    \ be possible to transition from a full-mesh\n         configuration without the\
    \ need to change either topology or AS.\n         This is an unfortunate management\
    \ overhead of the technique\n         proposed in [3].\n      o  Compatibility\n\
    \         It must be possible for noncompliant IBGP peers to continue to\n   \
    \      be part of the original AS or domain without any loss of BGP\n        \
    \ routing information.\n   These criteria were motivated by operational experiences\
    \ of a very\n   large and topology-rich network with many external connections.\n"

- title: 5.  Terminology and Concepts
  contents:
  - "5.  Terminology and Concepts\n   We use the term \"route reflection\" to describe\
    \ the operation of a BGP\n   speaker advertising an IBGP learned route to another\
    \ IBGP peer.  Such\n   a BGP speaker is said to be a \"route reflector\" (RR),\
    \ and such a\n   route is said to be a reflected route.\n   The internal peers\
    \ of an RR are divided into two groups:\n      1) Client peers\n      2) Non-Client\
    \ peers\n   An RR reflects routes between these groups, and may reflect routes\n\
    \   among client peers.  An RR along with its client peers form a\n   cluster.\

- title: 6.  Operation
  contents:
  - "6.  Operation\n   When an RR receives a route from an IBGP peer, it selects the\
    \ best\n   path based on its path selection rule.  After the best path is\n  \
    \ selected, it must do the following depending on the type of peer it\n   is receiving\
    \ the best path from\n      1) A route from a Non-Client IBGP peer:\n        \
    \ Reflect to all the Clients.\n      2) A route from a Client peer:\n        \
    \ Reflect to all the Non-Client peers and also to the Client\n         peers.\
    \  (Hence the Client peers are not required to be fully\n         meshed.)\n \
    \  An Autonomous System could have many RRs.  An RR treats other RRs\n   just\
    \ like any other internal BGP speakers.  An RR could be configured\n   to have\
    \ other RRs in a Client group or Non-client group.\n   In a simple configuration,\
    \ the backbone could be divided into many\n   clusters.  Each RR would be configured\
    \ with other RRs as Non-Client\n   peers (thus all the RRs will be fully meshed).\
    \  The Clients will be\n   configured to maintain IBGP session only with the RR\
    \ in their\n   cluster.  Due to route reflection, all the IBGP speakers will receive\n\
    \   reflected routing information.\n   It is possible in an Autonomous System\
    \ to have BGP speakers that do\n   not understand the concept of route reflectors\
    \ (let us call them\n   conventional BGP speakers).  The route reflector scheme\
    \ allows such\n   conventional BGP speakers to coexist.  Conventional BGP speakers\n\
    \   could be members of either a Non-Client group or a Client group.\n   This\
    \ allows for an easy and gradual migration from the current IBGP\n   model to\
    \ the route reflection model.  One could start creating\n   clusters by configuring\
    \ a single router as the designated RR and\n   configuring other RRs and their\
    \ clients as normal IBGP peers.\n   Additional clusters can be created gradually.\n"
- title: 7.  Redundant RRs
  contents:
  - "7.  Redundant RRs\n   Usually, a cluster of clients will have a single RR.  In\
    \ that case,\n   the cluster will be identified by the BGP Identifier of the RR.\n\
    \   However, this represents a single point of failure so to make it\n   possible\
    \ to have multiple RRs in the same cluster, all RRs in the\n   same cluster can\
    \ be configured with a 4-byte CLUSTER_ID so that an RR\n   can discard routes\
    \ from other RRs in the same cluster.\n"
- title: 8.  Avoiding Routing Information Loops
  contents:
  - "8.  Avoiding Routing Information Loops\n   When a route is reflected, it is possible\
    \ through misconfiguration to\n   form route re-distribution loops.  The route\
    \ reflection method\n   defines the following attributes to detect and avoid routing\n\
    \   information loops:\n   ORIGINATOR_ID\n   ORIGINATOR_ID is a new optional,\
    \ non-transitive BGP attribute of Type\n   code 9.  This attribute is 4 bytes\
    \ long and it will be created by an\n   RR in reflecting a route.  This attribute\
    \ will carry the BGP\n   Identifier of the originator of the route in the local\
    \ AS.  A BGP\n   speaker SHOULD NOT create an ORIGINATOR_ID attribute if one already\n\
    \   exists.  A router that recognizes the ORIGINATOR_ID attribute SHOULD\n   ignore\
    \ a route received with its BGP Identifier as the ORIGINATOR_ID.\n   CLUSTER_LIST\n\
    \   CLUSTER_LIST is a new, optional, non-transitive BGP attribute of Type\n  \
    \ code 10.  It is a sequence of CLUSTER_ID values representing the\n   reflection\
    \ path that the route has passed.\n   When an RR reflects a route, it MUST prepend\
    \ the local CLUSTER_ID to\n   the CLUSTER_LIST.  If the CLUSTER_LIST is empty,\
    \ it MUST create a new\n   one.  Using this attribute an RR can identify if the\
    \ routing\n   information has looped back to the same cluster due to\n   misconfiguration.\
    \  If the local CLUSTER_ID is found in the\n   CLUSTER_LIST, the advertisement\
    \ received SHOULD be ignored.\n"
- title: 9.  Impact on Route Selection
  contents:
  - "9.  Impact on Route Selection\n   The BGP Decision Process Tie Breaking rules\
    \ (Sect.  9.1.2.2, [1]) are\n   modified as follows:\n      If a route carries\
    \ the ORIGINATOR_ID attribute, then in Step f)\n      the ORIGINATOR_ID SHOULD\
    \ be treated as the BGP Identifier of the\n      BGP speaker that has advertised\
    \ the route.\n      In addition, the following rule SHOULD be inserted between\
    \ Steps\n      f) and g): a BGP Speaker SHOULD prefer a route with the shorter\n\
    \      CLUSTER_LIST length.  The CLUSTER_LIST length is zero if a route\n    \
    \  does not carry the CLUSTER_LIST attribute.\n"
- title: 10.  Implementation Considerations
  contents:
  - "10.  Implementation Considerations\n   Care should be taken to make sure that\
    \ none of the BGP path\n   attributes defined above can be modified through configuration\
    \ when\n   exchanging internal routing information between RRs and Clients and\n\
    \   Non-Clients.  Their modification could potentially result in routing\n   loops.\n\
    \   In addition, when a RR reflects a route, it SHOULD NOT modify the\n   following\
    \ path attributes: NEXT_HOP, AS_PATH, LOCAL_PREF, and MED.\n   Their modification\
    \ could potentially result in routing loops.\n"
- title: 11.  Configuration and Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "11.  Configuration and Deployment Considerations\n   The BGP protocol provides\
    \ no way for a Client to identify itself\n   dynamically as a Client of an RR.\
    \  The simplest way to achieve this\n   is by manual configuration.\n   One of\
    \ the key component of the route reflection approach in\n   addressing the scaling\
    \ issue is that the RR summarizes routing\n   information and only reflects its\
    \ best path.\n   Both Multi-Exit Discriminators (MEDs) and Interior Gateway Protocol\n\
    \   (IGP) metrics may impact the BGP route selection.  Because MEDs are\n   not\
    \ always comparable and the IGP metric may differ for each router,\n   with certain\
    \ route reflection topologies the route reflection\n   approach may not yield\
    \ the same route selection result as that of the\n   full IBGP mesh approach.\
    \  A way to make route selection the same as\n   it would be with the full IBGP\
    \ mesh approach is to make sure that\n   route reflectors are never forced to\
    \ perform the BGP route selection\n   based on IGP metrics that are significantly\
    \ different from the IGP\n   metrics of their clients, or based on incomparable\
    \ MEDs.  The former\n   can be achieved by configuring the intra-cluster IGP metrics\
    \ to be\n   better than the inter-cluster IGP metrics, and maintaining full mesh\n\
    \   within the cluster.  The latter can be achieved by\n      o  setting the local\
    \ preference of a route at the border router to\n         reflect the MED values,\
    \ or\n      o  making sure the AS-path lengths from different ASes are\n     \
    \    different when the AS-path length is used as a route selection\n        \
    \ criteria, or\n      o  configuring community-based policies to influence the\
    \ route\n         selection.\n   One could argue though that the latter requirement\
    \ is overly\n   restrictive, and perhaps impractical in some cases.  One could\n\
    \   further argue that as long as there are no routing loops, there are\n   no\
    \ compelling reasons to force route selection with route reflectors\n   to be\
    \ the same as it would be with the full IBGP mesh approach.\n   To prevent routing\
    \ loops and maintain consistent routing view, it is\n   essential that the network\
    \ topology be carefully considered in\n   designing a route reflection topology.\
    \  In general, the route\n   reflection topology should be congruent with the\
    \ network topology\n   when there exist multiple paths for a prefix.  One commonly\
    \ used\n   approach is the reflection based on Point of Presence (POP), in which\n\
    \   each POP maintains its own route reflectors serving clients in the\n   POP,\
    \ and all route reflectors are fully meshed.  In addition, clients\n   of the\
    \ reflectors in each POP are often fully meshed for the purpose\n   of optimal\
    \ intra-POP routing, and the intra-POP IGP metrics are\n   configured to be better\
    \ than the inter-POP IGP metrics.\n"

  - "Appendix B: Comparison with RFC 1966\n   All the changes listed in Appendix A,\
    \ plus the following.\n   Several terminologies related to route reflection are\
    \ clarified, and\n   the reference to EBGP routes/peers are removed.\n   The handling\
    \ of a routing information loop (due to route reflection)\n   by a receiver is\
    \ clarified and made more consistent.\n   The addition of a CLUSTER_ID to the\
    \ CLUSTER_LIST has been changed\n   from \"append\" to \"prepend\" to reflect\
    \ the deployed code.\n   The section on \"Configuration and Deployment Considerations\"\
    \ has been\n   expanded to address several operational issues.\n"
