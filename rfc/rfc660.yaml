  - "       SOME CHANGES TO THE IMP AND THE IMP/HOST INTERFACE\nIn the next few weeks\
    \ several changes will be made to the IMP\nsoftware including changes to the IMP/Host\
    \ software interface\nas specified in BBN Report No. 1822, Specifications for\
    \ the\nInterconnection of a Host and an IMP. These changes come in\nfour areas:\
    \ a) decoupling of the message number sequences of\nHosts; b) Host/Host access\
    \ control; c) expansion of the\nmessage number window from four to eight; and\
    \ d) provision for\nmessages outside the normal message number mechanism. All\
    \ changes\nare backward compatible with possible minor exceptions in timing.\n\
    a. Decoupling of the Host/Host message number sequences:\n   Since 1972 the IMP\
    \ system has provided for exactly four\n   messages to be outstanding at a time\
    \ between any pair of\n   IMPs, and thus, a total of only four messages between\n\
    \   all the possible pairs of Hosts on the two IMPs. Because\n   all the pairs\
    \ of Hosts on the two IMPs have had to share\n   the four outstanding messages,\
    \ it has been quite possible\n   for the various Hosts to interfere with each\
    \ other. To\n   remove this possibility of interference, the IMP's\n   message\
    \ number logic will soon be changed to allow a\n   separate message number sequence\
    \ between each pair of Hosts.\n   To keep manageable the space required to maintain\
    \ the\n   Host/Host message sequences above that presently are required\n   for\
    \ the IMP/IMP message sequences, the Host/Host sequences\n   will be taken dynamically\
    \ from a limited pool of possible\n   sequences. The pool will be sufficiently\
    \ large to seldom\n   interfere with a pair of Hosts wishing to communicate. In\n\
    \   no case will Hosts be prevented from communicating. In\n   the event that\
    \ the Hosts on an IMP desire to simultaneously\n   communicate with so many other\
    \ Hosts that the pool would\n   be exhausted, the space in the pool is quickly\
    \ multiplexed\n   in time among all the desired Host/Host conversations\n   so\
    \ that none is stopped although all are possibly slowed.\nb. Host/Host access\
    \ control:\n   Upon instructions from ARPA, we will soon add a Host/Host\n   access\
    \ control mechanism to the IMPs. Any pair of Hosts\n   wishing to communicate\
    \ is checked (via bits in the IMP)\n   to verify that they have administrative\
    \ permission to\n   communicate. This check normally is made whenever a pair\n\
    \   of Hosts attempts to communicate after not having\n   communicated for two\
    \ minutes. If the pair of Hosts is\n   not allowed to communicate, a special type\
    \ of Destination\n   Dead Message (sub-code 3) is returned to the source\n   Host.\
    \ The default case initially will be to allow all\n   Hosts to communicate with\
    \ each other.\n   Once the message number sequences are on a Host/Host\n   rather\
    \ than IMP/IMP basis, the number of messages that\n   will be permitted to be\
    \ outstanding at a time between\n   a pair of Hosts will be expanded from four\
    \ to eight,\n   permitting increased Host/Host throughput in some cases.\nd. Message\
    \ outside the normal mechanism:.\n   For certain limited experiments which are\
    \ being carried on\n   using the network, it is thought to be desirable\n   for\
    \ specified Hosts to be able to communicate outside the\n   normal ordered, error\
    \ controlled message sequences.\n   Thus, the following expansion to the IMP/Host\
    \ protocol is being\n   provided.\ni. a single packet message coming from the\
    \ source Host\n   to the source IMP with a (new) special message type,\n   3,\
    \ will be put directly into the IMP store-and-forward\n   logic with a mark saying\
    \ the packet is this special\n   kind of message. A multi-packet message of type\
    \ 3\n   will be discarded.\nii. such messages (packets) are routed normally to\
    \ the\n   destination IMP, possibly arriving out of order.\niii. at the destination\
    \ IMP, messages of the special\n   type will be put directly on the destination\
    \ Host\n   output queue skipping the reassembly logic and marked\n   with a special\
    \ (new) IMP to Host message type, also 3.\niv. there is no source-to-destination\
    \ retransmission\n   logic, no reassembly, no RFNMs, no incomplete\n   transmissions,\
    \ etc.\nv. if at any time there are insufficient resources in the\n   network\
    \ to handle one of these special messages\n   (e.g., the destination Host won't\
    \ take it), the\n   message will be discarded.\nvi. by using the special message\
    \ type between the Host\n   and the IMP, the normal message number mechanism is\n\
    \   preserved for all the Host/Host transmissions which\n   presently depend on\
    \ it.\nBecause the uncontrolled use of this mechanism will degrade the\nperformance\
    \ of the network for all users, the set of Hosts permitted\nto use this mechanism\
    \ will be regulated by the Network Control\nCenter.\nPlease file this note with\
    \ your copy of BBN Report 1822 until\nthat document is updated.\n"
