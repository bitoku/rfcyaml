    Network Service.  This document defines a new network address\n    format, and
    rules for using some existing network address\n    formats.  The scope of this
    document is:\n1.  Any TCP/IP network supporting COTS using RFC 1006.\n2.  Any
    mapping of COTS onto X.25 (usually X.25(80)), where X.25 is\n    not used to provide

    Network Addresses            November 1991\n1  Introduction\nThe OSI Directory
    specifies an encoding of Presentation Address, which\nutilises OSI Network Addresses
    as defined in the OSI Network Layer\nstandards [CCI88] [ISO87a].  The OSI Directory,
    and any OSI\napplication utilising the OSI Directory must be able use these Network\nAddresses
    to identify end systems.\nCurrently, OSI applications are often run over lower
    layers other than\nthe OSI Network Service.  It is neither reasonable nor desirable
    for\ngroups wishing to investigate and use OSI Applications in conjunction\nwith
    the OSI Directory to be dependent on a global OSI Network\nService.  This RFCdefines
    mechanisms to encode addressing information\nwithin Network Addresses, in order
    to support this type of working.\nIn particular, support is defined for RFC 1006
    mapping of COTS onto\nTCP/IP and COTS mapped onto X.25(1980) [RC87, CCI80].\nWhere
    an OSI application is run over CLNS on the internet, the NSAP\nGuidelines of RFC
    1237 should be followed [CGC91].\nThis document must be read in the context of
    ISO 8348 Addendum 2\n[ISO87b].  It will not be meaningful on its own.\n1.1  Historical
    Note\nThis document was originally published as UCL Research Note RN/89/13\nand
    as a project THORN internal document [Kil89].  It was devised in\nresponse to
    two projects which faced this requirement, and was agreed\nas a common approach.
    \ The projects were:\n o  The THORN project, which is an Esprit Project building
    an OSI\n    Directory [SA88].\n o  The ISODE project [Ros90], and in particular
    the QUIPU directory\n    being developed at UCL [Kil88].\nThe proposal has been
    implemented, and the viability of the solution\ndemonstrated.\nRFC 1277           Encoding
    Network Addresses            November 1991\n2  Problem Statement\nWhen utilising
    the OSI Directory, the OSI location of an End System\nwill be determined by a
    Network Address, which is taken from a\nPresentation Address, looked up in the
    OSI Directory.\nOSI applications are currently operated over the following lower\nlayers.\n
    o  An international X.25 network, which routes on the basis of X.121\n    addresses.
    \ By and large this is X.25(80), but some parts are now\n    X.25(84) and will
    carry Network Addresses as user data.  OSI\n    Transport is mapped onto the variant
    of X.25 which is available.\n o  Large private X.25 networks, which do not have
    DNICs, but are\n    otherwise similar to the previous (in particular Janet).\n
    o  Isolated networks running Connection Oriented Network Service\n    (e.g., Pink
    Book Ethernets).\n o  Isolated networks running Connectionless Network Service
    (e.g.,\n    MAP LANs).\n o  The Connectionless Network Service Protocol (CLNP)
    pilot,\n    currently taking place in the NSFNet and NORDUNet communities.\n o
    \ Isolated TCP/IP LANs, utilising RFC 1006 to support the OSI\n    Transport Service[RC87].\n
    o  The DARPA/NSF Internet, using RFC 1006.\nIn general, these systems need to
    be interconnected by the use of\ntransport bridging or application relaying.  Operation
    of transport\nbridges causes a number of problems which it is desirable to avoid.\nOnly
    some applications can support relaying, and this is not always\nsatisfactory.\n2.1
    \ The ``Right Solution''\nIt is worth noting briefly what the intended (OSI) solution
    is.  There\nis a single global network service.  Network Addresses are globally\nallocated,
    and do not imply anything about routing or location.  An\nRFC 1277           Encoding
    Network Addresses            November 1991\nEnd System is attached to one or more
    subnetworks at Subnetwork Points\nof Attachment (SNPAs).  Intermediate Systems
    join subnetworks, again\nbeing attached at SNPAs.  Routing is achieved by repeated
    binding of\nNetwork Address to SNPA (initially at the Originating End System,
    and\nthen at each Intermediate System).  This binding is achieved by\nnetwork
    level routing mechanisms.\nThis can only work in a pure OSI environment with a
    single ubiquitous\nnetwork service (either connectionless or connection-oriented),
    and so\nis not sufficient for the problem being addressed by this note.\n2.2  General
    Approach\nThis section describes the use of network addresses, and gives a\nfunctional
    overview of the problem being takceled.  The means of\nconnecting to a remote
    Application Entity is broadly as follows.\n1.  Look up the Application Entity
    in the OSI Directory to obtain the\n    Presentation Address 1.\n2.  Extract each
    Network Address from the Presentation Address, and\n    determine if it can be
    used (and how).\n3.  Determine an order of preference for the Network Addresses.\n4.
    \ Attempt to connect to one or more of the Network Addresses.\nThis note is concerned
    with the second step, and will probably have\nimplications on the third.  There
    is currently no directory service to\nprovide step 2, and so this (interim) approach
    must be algorithmic.\nAll addressing information required for the network must
    be extracted\nfrom the network address.\nThis note describes the use of Network
    Addresses for networks which do\nnot provide the OSI Network Service (CLNS or
    CONS), and places\nconstraints on the use of X.121 form network addresses when
    used for\nan OSI Network Service.  The following types of Network Address are\ndiscussed
    in this note:\n----------------------------\n    1. Strictly an Application Entity
    should have only one\nPresentation Address.  In practice it may have several,
    and the\nnetwork addresses of each Presentation Address should be considered.\nRFC
    1277           Encoding Network Addresses            November 1991\n o  Use of
    X.121 form Network Addresses.\n o  A special encoding of Telex form Network Addresses.\n3
    \ Network addresses with X.121 AFI\nThis note defines an approach for use of network
    addresses with the\nX.121 AFI.\nThe IDP of network addresses is used to allow
    worldwide administration\nof the NSAP address space.  As such, not all values
    of the IDP will in\npractice have topological significance (which implies that
    in some\ncases the IDP will not be sufficient for network layer routing).\nHowever,
    it is recommended that any End System using the Connection\nOriented Network Service
    and with access to the international X.25\nservice uses the X.121 form of NSAP
    address relative to its access\npoint.  This allows routing across the worldwide
    X.25 based public\ndata networks to be based on the X.121 addresses.  Allocation
    of DSP\n(Domain Specific Part) within this form of address is a private issue.\nThe
    IDP is primarily an allocation mechanism, and the user (end\nsystem) cannot in
    principle assume any implied routing.  However, due\nto the lack of a network
    directory service, it is recommended that any\nEnd System with Connection Oriented
    Network Service and access to the\ninternational X.25 service uses X.121 form
    relative to its access\npoint.  Allocation of DSP (Domain Specific Part) is a
    private issue.\nConversely it is recommended that if an X.121 IDP (Initial Domain\nPart)
    form Network Address is interpreted, then the X.121 address will\nprovide a route
    (by defining an SNPA on the international X.25\nnetwork).  There may be additional
    and perhaps preferable routes which\ncan be determined by private means.\nIf the
    DSP is absent, the form should be interpreted as implying a\nmapping of Transport
    onto X.25(80).\n4  New Network Address Format\nThis section defines a new network
    address format.  The scope of this\nformat is currently:\n1.  Any TCP/IP network
    supporting COTS using RFC 1006.\nRFC 1277           Encoding Network Addresses
    \           November 1991\n2.  Any mapping of COTS onto X.25 (usually X.25(80)),
    where X.25 is\n    not used to provide CONS (i.e., only DTE and not Network address\n
    \   is carried), except where the international X.25 service is used\n    and
    no PID or CUDF is required.\n    These exceptions are the cases which are handled
    by use of X.121\n    AFI (Section 3).  The intention is to use the X.121 AFI wherever\n
    \   possible, and the formats defined in this section are for the\n    remaining
    cases.\nThe approach could also be extended to use with other means of\nproviding
    COTS (or CLTS). It is not appropriate for use where CONS or\nCLNS is used to provide
    COTS (or CLTS).\n4.1  Requirements\nThe requirements for use of OSI over existing
    networks not supporting\nCONS or CLNS, when using the OSI Directory are:\n1.  The
    information for the layers below Transport must be obtained\n    from the Network
    Address.  This is essential, because we wish to\n    use the OSI Directory in
    a standard manner, and the Network\n    Address is the information available.\n2.
    \ The Network Addresses must be globally unique, as they can be\n    looked up
    by anyone with access to the Directory.\n3.  The Network Address should be allocated
    so that confusion with a\n    ``real'' Network Address (i.e., one which defines
    an NSAP using\n    CONS or CLNS as opposed to X.25(80) or RFC 1006) is unlikely.\n4.
    \ Network Addresses must be interpretable on the basis of a well\n    known information,
    or on information which can be obtained from\n    the (application level) OSI
    Directory.  (This RFConly uses well\n    known information).\n5.  The identity
    of the network in question must be deducible from the\n    Network Address\n6.
    \ All network specific addressing information (including the SNPA)\n    must be
    deducible from the Network Address\nRFC 1277           Encoding Network Addresses
    \           November 1991\n4.2  IDP Choice\nThe IDP is used with Telex AFI. The
    Telex AFI is used because:\n o  It gives the largest DSP\n o  It is less likely
    than other forms to be used for ``real'' Network\n    Addresses\nThe following
    AFIs might have been chosen, but are not used for the\nreasons given:\n o  Local
    (the values must be globally unique)\n o  X.121 (because it may be confused with
    other uses of OSI network\n    addresses)\n o  DCC and ICD (because it may be
    confused with other uses of OSI\n    network addresses)\nThe IDI should be assigned
    in a manner appropriate to the use of the\nencoding.  For example, for operation
    on a private network within an\norganisation, the telex number of that organisation
    would be a good\nchoice.  Some well known networks are given assignments in Appendix
    A.\n4.3  The DSP Encoding\nThe network address is used as follows.\n o  A (sub)network
    is identified by the IDP and a small part of the\n    DSP.\n o  The remainder
    of the DSP encodes network specific information\nThe DSP format is now defined.
    \ The top level format is independent of\nthe means used to provde COTS. Two formats
    for the remainder of the\nDSP are then defined, for specific means of providing
    COTS.\nA decimal abstract encoding is defined for the DSP. The ECMA 117\nformat
    might have been used, but it is not suitable.  [TC386].  Use of\nRFC 1277           Encoding
    Network Addresses            November 1991\nvery attractive approach.  However,
    there is insufficient space in the\nNetwork Address for this to be feasible.\nThe
    following structure is defined:\n                 ____________________________________\n
    \                |_Digit___||1-2__|______3-27_______|_\n                 |_Meaning_||PrefixN|etwork_Specific_|\n2
    digits Prefix.  This allows for multiple usage of the same DSP, by\n    not consuming
    it all.  It also allows for the DSP to be used with\n    different encodings.\nNetwork
    Specific The network specific allocation should be less than\n    20 digits if
    this DSP structure is to be used with any IDI format.\n    This is increased to
    27 for the Telex format.\nThe IDP + 2 digit prefix identify a subnetwork in which
    the value of\nthe remainder of the DSP (Network Specific Part) is to be interpreted.\n4.4
    \ X.25(80) Network Specific Format\nThe IDP/Prefix identifies an X.25(80) subnetwork.
    \ There is a need to\nrepresent a DTE Number, and optionally an X.25 Protocol
    ID or CUDF\n(many implementations require these due to shortage of X.121 address\nspace)
    in the DSP. This is structured in one of two possible ways:\n                       ________________________\n
    \                      |_Digit___||1R|emainder_|\n                       |_Meaning_||0_|_DTE____|_\n

    network specific part is structured as follows:\nType This has the following values\n
    \   0 DTE only\nRFC 1277           Encoding Network Addresses            November
    1991\n    2 DTE + CUDF\n    3-9 Reserved\nPID/CUDF Length The length of the PID/CUDF
    in octets\nPID/CUDF The PID/CUDF takes as many digits as indicated by 3 times\n
    \   octet 2.  Each octet of the PID/CUDF is encoded as three decimal\n    digits,
    representing the decimal value of the octet.\nDTE The DTE is terminated by the
    end of the Network Address.\nFor example, the JANET DTE 000005111600 with ASCII
    CUDF ``12'' would\nbe encoded in the following way.  The first lines describe
    the\nabstract notation.  Note that where the IDI is not of maximum length,\nthat
    the translation to concrete decimal is not mechanical\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n|Part___|_|_____IDP_________|_______________________DSP_______________________|_\n|Comp___|_|AFI__|___IDI_____|Prefix_|Dte+Cudf_|Len|________CUDF_+_DTE_________|_\n|Octet__|_|____|____________|_1-2___|___3_____|_4_|___________5-20____________|_\n|Value__|T|elex_|007_28722__|__02___|___2_____|_2_|____049050_000005111600____|__\n|Ct_Dec_|_|54___|007_28722__|__02___|___2_____|_2_|____049050_000005111600____|_\n|Ct_Bin_|_|54___|00_72_87_22_|_02___|_____22______|04_90_50_00_00_51_11_60_0f_|_\nNote
    that concrete binary is representing octets in hexadecimal.  This\nis the syntax
    most likely to be used in practice.  The CUDF is\nrepresented by two octets 049
    and 050 (decimal), which map to six\ndigits.\n4.5  TCP/IP (RFC 1006) Network Specific
    Format\nThe IDP and 2 digit prefix identifies a TCP/IP network where RFC 1006\nis
    applied.  It is necessary to use an IP Address, as there are\ninsufficient bits
    to fit in a domain.  It is structured as follows:\n      __________________________________________________________\n

    1277           Encoding Network Addresses            November 1991\nFor TCP/IP
    there shall be a 20 digit long network-specific part.\nFirst 12 digits are for
    the IP address.  The port number can be up to\n65535, and needs 5 digits (this
    is optional, and is defaulted as\ndefined in RFC 1006).  Finally, there is a third
    part to the address,\nwhich is defined here as ``transport set'' that indicates
    what kind of\nIP-based transport protocols is used.  This is a decimal number
    from\n0-65535 which is really a 16-bit flag word.  1 is TCP, 2 is UDP.\nFurther
    values of this code are assigned by the IANA. If the transport\nset is not there
    or no bits are set, it means ``default'' which is\nTCP. This is encoded in 5 digits.\nFor
    example, the IP Address 10.0.0.6 with port 9 over UDP is encoded\nas:\n____________________________________________________________________________\n|Part______|_|_____IDP_________|____________________DSP____________________|_\n|Component_|_|AFI__|___IDI_____|Prefix_|___IP_Address_____|_Port__|_T_Set__|_\n|Octet_____|_|____|____________|_1-2___|______3-14________|_15-19_|_20-24__|_\n|Value_____|T|elex_|007_28722__|__03___|_010_000_000_006__|_00009_|_00002__|__\n|Cncrt_Dec_|_|54___|007_28722__|__03___|_010_000_000_006__|_00009_|_00002__|_\n|Cncrt_Bin_|_|54___|00_72_87_22_|_03___|01_00_00_00_00_06_|00_00_9|0_00_02_|_\n5
