    6\n   (DHCPv6) option that contains a list of domain names or IPv6\n   addresses
    that can be mapped to one or more Session Initiation\n   Protocol (SIP) outbound
    proxy servers.  This is one of the many\n   methods that a SIP client can use
    to obtain the addresses of such a\n   local SIP server.\n"

    \  A SIP server is defined in RFC 3261 [2].  This server MUST be an\n   outbound
    proxy server, as defined in [3].  In the context of this\n   document, a SIP server
    refers to the host the outbound SIP proxy\n   server is running on.\n   A SIP
    client is defined in RFC 3261 [2].  The client can be a user\n   agent client
    or the client portion of a proxy server.  In the context\n   of this document,
    a SIP client refers to the host the SIP client is\n   running on.\n   In this
    document, the key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",\n   \"SHALL\", \"SHALL
    NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",\n   and \"OPTIONAL\"
    are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119\n   [4].\n"

  - "2.  Introduction\n   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [2] is an application-layer\n
    \  control protocol that can establish, modify and terminate multimedia\n   sessions
    or calls.  A SIP system has a number of logical components:\n   user agents, proxy
    servers, redirect servers and registrars.  User\n   agents MAY contain SIP clients,
    proxy servers always do.\n   This document specifies two DHCPv6 options [1] that
    allow SIP clients\n   to locate a local SIP server that is to be used for all
    outbound SIP\n   requests, a so-called outbound proxy server.  (SIP clients MAY\n
    \  contact the address identified in the SIP URL directly, without\n   involving
    a local SIP server.  However in some circumstances, such as\n   when firewalls
    are present, or local dialing plans, local emergency\n   and other services need
    to be provided, SIP clients need to use a\n   local server for outbound requests.)
    \ This is one of many possible\n   solutions for locating the outbound SIP server;
    manual configuration\n   is an example of another.\n"
  title: 2.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "3.  SIP Server DHCPv6 Option\n   This document defines two DHCPv6 options that
    describe a local\n   outbound SIP proxy: one carries a list of domain names (Section
    3.1),\n   the other a list of 128-bit (binary) IPv6 addresses (Section 3.2).\n
    \     Since DHCPv6 does not suffer from a shortage of option codes, we\n      avoid
    the encoding byte found in the IPv4 DHCP option for SIP\n      servers [6].  This
    makes the option shorter, easier to parse,\n      simplifies appropriate word
    alignment for the numeric addresses\n      and allows the client to request either
    numeric or domain name\n      options using the \"option request option\".\n   An
    implementation implementing this specification MUST support both\n   options.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1  SIP Servers Domain Name List\n   The option length is followed by a sequence
      of labels, encoded\n   according to Section 3.1 of RFC 1035 [5], quoted below:\n
      \     \"Domain names in messages are expressed in terms of a sequence of\n      labels.
      \ Each label is represented as a one octet length field\n      followed by that
      number of octets.  Since every domain name ends\n      with the null label of
      the root, a domain name is terminated by a\n      length byte of zero.  The
      high order two bits of every length\n      octet must be zero, and the remaining
      six bits of the length field\n      limit the label to 63 octets or less.  To
      simplify\n      implementations, the total length of a domain name (i.e., label\n
      \     octets and label length octets) is restricted to 255 octets or\n      less.\"\n
      \     RFC 1035 encoding was chosen to accommodate future\n      internationalized
      domain name mechanisms.\n   The option MAY contain multiple domain names, but
      these SHOULD refer\n   to different NAPTR records, rather than different A records.
      \ The\n   client MUST try the records in the order listed, applying the\n   mechanism
      described in Section 4.1 of RFC 3263 [3] for each.  The\n   client only resolves
      the subsequent domain names if attempts to\n   contact the first one failed
      or yielded no common transport protocols\n   between client and server or denote
      a domain administratively\n   prohibited by client policy.  Domain names MUST
      be listed in order of\n   preference.\n      Use of multiple domain names is
      not meant to replace NAPTR or SRV\n      records, but rather to allow a single
      DHCP server to indicate\n      outbound proxy servers operated by multiple providers.\n

    \  led to contact a rogue SIP server, possibly one that then intercepts\n   call
    requests or denies service.  A modified DHCP answer could also\n   omit host names
    that translated to TLS-based SIP servers, thus\n   facilitating intercept.\n"
