1.  Command name and code.
permission  to  transmit SUPDUP OUTPUT format messages over the TELNET connection.
The sender  of this command
that  he  will  no  longer  send SUPDUP OUTPUT format messages over the TELNET connection.
The sender  of this command
permission to send SUPDUP OUTPUT format messages over the TELNET connection.
The sender  of this  command
not  send SUPDUP OUTPUT format messages over the TELNET connection.
The sender of this command (which must be the TELNET user process) is supplying   information  describing  the  capabilities  of  the  user process' terminal.
TDn SCx SCy IAC SE
The sender  of this command, which must be the TELNET server process, is sending  explicit  screen control information to be carried out by the user TELNET process.
SUPDUP OUTPUT DON'T SUPDUP OUTPUT i.e., the SUPDUP OUTPUT format messages may not be transmitted.
The SUPDUP OUTPUT  protocol  provides  a means to access  the virtual display
support provided by the SUPDUP protocol (see RFC 734) within the context  of a standard  TELNET connection.
This allows occasional display oriented  programs  at non display oriented  servers  to take advantage  of the standardized  display  support  provided by SUPDUP.
This cannot  be done with the standard  SUPDUP protocol or the TELNET SUPDUP option (RFC 736), for they both require that all communication after the negotiation  to  use  SUPDUP
has  been  completed  proceed according  to the protocol  of RFC 734.
This places upon the server
total responsibility  for screen  management  for the duration of the connection,  which, by hypothesis, the non display oriented server is not willing to accept.
programs  at display oriented  user hosts provide  local screen  management  by mapping  the NVT commands of TELNET into local screen   management   commands;   often,   this  involves  scrolling, end of page  processing, line clearing etc.
The SUPDUP OUTPUT option allows  a display oriented  application program at the server side to take over  screen  management  explicitly,  via  the  SUPDUP  display control repertoire.
TELNET remains in effect throughout.
The IAC IP and other TELNET commands are still valid.
By means of the SUPDUP OUTPUT  option,  display oriented programs can run  on  the  server   host,  and  control
The user TELNET process sends a description of the user terminal  (as specified in RFC 734) to the server TELNET process as a subnegiotiation  block when the SUPDUP OUTPUT  negotiation  has  been successfully  completed.
The server  TELNET  process sends explicit screen  control commands via subnegotiation blocks to the user TELNET process.
The SUPDUP OUTPUT protocol may only be initiated by the server TELNET process.
A server  TELNET  process wishing to take advantage of the SUPDUP OUTPUT  protocol will initiate a negotiation for it by sending IAC
The user  TELNET  process  must  accept  or refuse  the offer by  sending  IAC  DO
If the user  TELNET  process  agrees  to  support
must  follow   the  sending  of  IAC  DO
a  description  of  the  user's  terminal.
This information  is described in RFC 734 as the "terminal parameters.
Telnet SUPDUP OUTPUT Option TELNET
These  words may or may not contain the optional line speed and graphics capabilities parameters described by RFC 747
; the first  six bytes  specify  the count of 36 bit words to follow as described by RFC 734.
The terminal  parameter block will be sent as a subnegotiation of the SUPDUP OUTPUT option:
The byte of "1"  is a command  code,  for compatibility  with  future extensions.
Upon receipt  of the terminal  parameter block from the user TELNET process, the server TELNET process may send SUPDUP OUTPUT blocks as described below.
The server  TELNET  process  can specify explicit control of the user host's  screen  by  the  sending  of  subnegotiation  blocks  of  the SUPDUP OUTPUT  option.
The byte of "2"  is a command  code,  for compatibility  with  future extensions.
The TDm bytes are the "%TDCODEs" and printing characters of SUPDUP  output  of RFC 734.
N is a byte containing a count of the number  of TDm's in this transmission.
N may be zero, and may not be greater than 254 (decimal).
SCx and SCy are two bytes specifying the anticipated horizontal and vertical (respectively) coordinates of the cursor of the user host's screen after the latter has interpreted all the %TDCODEs in this transmission.
The motivation  for the SCx SCy screen  position
specification is to allow hosts running the ITS operating system, which will transmit the TDCODEs  directly  into the local output  system, to assert the "main program  level"  screen  position  without  any interpretation of the transmitted TDCODE sequence by the user TELNET program.
The user TELNET  process must manage the position of the local cursor with respect  to standard  TELNET NVT commands and output, and SUPDUP OUTPUT  transmissions.
The user TELNET  process may assume that the server  TELNET  process is managing both NVT and SUPDUP OUTPUT output in an integrated way.
The SUPDUP OUTPUT  option makes no statement about how input is sent; this may be negotiated via other options.
By default, NVT input will be used.
The user to server  screen  management commands of RFC 734 are NOT implicitly handled by IAC
In the absence  of the transmission  of SUPDUP OUTPUT  subnegotiation blocks,  a TELNET  connection operating with the SUPDUP OUTPUT option in effect is indistinguishable from a normal TELNET connection.
is highly  optional,  and if received by the user TELNET  process,  should  only be used to cause  a diagnostic if SUPDUP OUTPUT
If received,  the user TELNET  process  should  respond  with IAC  DON'T SUPDUP OUTPUT.
Because  of the optional  nature of IAC WON'T SUPDUP OUTPUT, the user TELNET  process  should  be prepared  to send the terminal  parameter subnegotiation  block each time
is  received, i.e., even if the user TELNET process believes SUPDUP OUTPUT to be in effect.
code may not be sent in a  SUPDUP OUTPUT transmission.
The user TELNET  program may assume that no byte in a subnegotiation block will be 255 (decimal).
