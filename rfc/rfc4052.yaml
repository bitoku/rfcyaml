  contents:
  - "1.  Liaison Relationships and Personnel\n   The IETF, as an organization, has\
    \ the need to engage in direct\n   communication or joint endeavors with various\
    \ other formal\n   organizations.  For example, the IETF is one of several Standards\n\
    \   Development Organizations, or SDOs, and all SDOs including the IETF\n   find\
    \ it increasingly necessary to communicate and coordinate their\n   activities\
    \ involving Internet-related technologies.  This is useful\n   in order to avoid\
    \ overlap in work efforts and to manage interactions\n   between their groups.\
    \  In cases where the mutual effort to\n   communicate and coordinate activities\
    \ is formalized, these\n   relationships are generically referred to as \"liaison\
    \ relationships\".\n   In such cases, a person from the IETF is designated to\
    \ manage a given\n   liaison relationship; that person is generally called the\
    \ \"IETF\n   liaison manager\" to the other organization.  When the liaison\n\
    \   relationship is expected to encompass a complex or broad range of\n   activities,\
    \ more people may be designated to undertake some portions\n   of the communications,\
    \ coordinated by the liaison manager.  Often,\n   the other organization will\
    \ similarly designate their own liaison\n   manager to the IETF.\n   This document\
    \ is chiefly concerned with:\n   o  the establishment and maintenance of liaison\
    \ relationships, and\n   o  the appointment and responsibilities of IETF liaison\
    \ managers and\n      representatives.\n   The management of other organizations'\
    \ liaison managers to the IETF,\n   whether or not in the context of a liaison\
    \ relationship, is outside\n   the scope of this document.\n   The IETF has chartered\
    \ the Internet Architecture Board to manage\n   liaison relationships.  Consistent\
    \ with its charter [2], the IAB acts\n   as representative of the interests of\
    \ the IETF and the Internet\n   Society in technical liaison relationships with\
    \ other organizations\n   concerned with standards and other technical and organizational\n\
    \   issues relevant to the worldwide Internet.  Liaison relationships are\n  \
    \ kept as informal as possible and must be of demonstrable value to the\n   IETF's\
    \ technical mandate.  Individual participants of the IETF are\n   appointed as\
    \ liaison managers or representatives to other\n   organizations by the IAB.\n\
    \   In general, a liaison relationship is most valuable when there are\n   areas\
    \ of technical development of mutual interest.  For the most\n   part, SDOs would\
    \ rather leverage existing work done by other\n   organizations than recreate\
    \ it themselves (and would like the same\n   done with respect to their own work).\
    \  Establishing a liaison\n   relationship can provide the framework for ongoing\
    \ communications to\n   o  prevent inadvertent duplication of effort, without\
    \ obstructing\n      either organization from pursuing its own mandate;\n   o\
    \  provide authoritative information of one organization's\n      dependencies\
    \ on the other's work.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Liaison Relationships
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Liaison Relationships\n   A liaison relationship is set up when it is mutually\
    \ agreeable and\n   needed for some specific purpose, in the view of the other\n\
    \   organization, the IAB, and the IETF participants conducting the work.\n  \
    \ There is no set process or form for this; the IETF participants and\n   the\
    \ peer organization approach the IAB, and after discussion come to\n   an agreement\
    \ to form the relationship.  In some cases, the intended\n   scope and guidelines\
    \ for the collaboration are documented\n   specifically (e.g., see [3], [4], and\
    \ [5]).\n   In setting up the relationship, the IAB expects that there will be\
    \ a\n   mutual exchange of views and discussion of the best approach for\n   undertaking\
    \ new standardization work items.  Any work items resulting\n   for the IETF will\
    \ be undertaken in the usual IETF procedures, defined\n   in [1].  The peer organization\
    \ often has different organizational\n   structure and procedures than the IETF,\
    \ which will require some\n   flexibility on the part of both organizations to\
    \ accommodate.  The\n   IAB expects that each organization will use the relationship\n\
    \   carefully, allowing time for the processes it requests to occur in\n   the\
    \ other organization, and will not make unreasonable demands.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Liaison Manager
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Liaison Manager\n   As described above, most work on mutually interesting\
    \ topics will be\n   carried out in the usual way within the IETF and the peer\n\
    \   organization.  Therefore, most communications will be informal in\n   nature\
    \ (for example, Working Group (WG) or mailing list discussions).\n   An important\
    \ function of the liaison manager is to ensure that\n   communication is maintained,\
    \ productive, and timely.  He or she may\n   use any applicable businesslike approach,\
    \ from private to public\n   communications, and bring in other parties as needed.\
    \  If a\n   communication from a peer organization is addressed to an\n   inappropriate\
    \ party, such as being sent to the WG but not copying the\n   Area Director (AD)\
    \ or being sent to the wrong WG, the liaison manager\n   will help redirect or\
    \ otherwise augment the communication.\n   IETF liaison managers should also communicate\
    \ and coordinate with\n   other liaison managers where concerned technical activities\
    \ overlap.\n   Since the IAB is ultimately responsible for liaison relationships,\n\
    \   anyone who has a problem with a relationship (whether an IETF\n   participant\
    \ or a person from the peer organization) should first\n   consult the IAB's designated\
    \ liaison manager, and if that does not\n   result in a satisfactory outcome,\
    \ the IAB itself.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Liaison Representatives
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Liaison Representatives\n   The liaison manager is, specifically, a representative\
    \ of the IETF\n   for the purpose of managing the liaison relationship.  There\
    \ may be\n   occasion to identify other representatives for the same relationship.\n\
    \   For example, if the area of mutual work is extensive, it might be\n   appropriate\
    \ to name several people as liaison representatives to\n   different parts of\
    \ the other organization.  Or, it might be\n   appropriate to name a liaison representative\
    \ to attend a particular\n   meeting.\n   These other liaison representatives\
    \ are selected by the IAB and work\n   in conjunction (and close communication)\
    \ with the liaison manager.\n   In some cases, this may also require communication\
    \ and coordination\n   with other liaison managers or representatives where concerned\n\
    \   technical activities overlap.  The specific responsibilities of the\n   liaison\
    \ representative will be identified at the time of appointment.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Liaison Communications
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Liaison Communications\n   Communications between organizations use a variety\
    \ of formal and\n   informal channels.  The stated preference of the IETF, which\
    \ is\n   largely an informal organization, is to use informal channels, as\n \
    \  these have historically worked well to expedite matters.  In some\n   cases,\
    \ however, a more formal communication is appropriate, either as\n   an adjunct\
    \ to the informal channel or in its place.  In the case of\n   formal communications,\
    \ the established procedures of many\n   organizations use a form known as a \"\
    liaison statement\".  Procedures\n   for sending, managing, and responding to\
    \ liaison statements are\n   discussed in [6].\n"
- title: 3.  Summary of IETF Liaison Manager Responsibilities
  contents:
  - "3.  Summary of IETF Liaison Manager Responsibilities\n   While the requirements\
    \ will certainly vary depending on the nature of\n   the peer organization and\
    \ the type of joint work being undertaken,\n   the general expectations of a liaison\
    \ manager appointed by the IAB\n   are as follows:\n   o  Attend relevant meetings\
    \ of the peer organization as needed and\n      report back to the appropriate\
    \ IETF organization any material\n      updates.\n   o  Carry any messages from\
    \ the IETF to the peer organization, when\n      specifically instructed.  Generally,\
    \ these communications\n      \"represent the IETF\", and therefore due care and\
    \ consensus must be\n      applied in their construction.\n   o  Prepare occasional\
    \ updates.  The target of these updates (e.g.,\n      the IAB, an AD, a WG) will\
    \ generally be identified upon\n      appointment.\n   o  Oversee delivery of\
    \ liaison statements addressed to the IETF,\n      ensuring that they reach the\
    \ appropriate destination within the\n      IETF, and ensure that relevant responses\
    \ from the IETF are created\n      and sent in a timely fashion.\n   o  Work with\
    \ the other organization to ensure that the IETF's liaison\n      statements are\
    \ appropriately directed and responded to in a timely\n      fashion.\n   o  Communicate\
    \ and coordinate with other IETF liaison managers and\n      representatives where\
    \ concerned technical activities overlap.\n"
- title: 4.  Approval and Transmission of Liaison Statements
  contents:
  - "4.  Approval and Transmission of Liaison Statements\n   It is important that\
    \ appropriate leadership review be made of\n   proposed IETF liaison statements\
    \ and that those writing such\n   statements, who claim to be speaking on behalf\
    \ of IETF, are truly\n   representing IETF views.\n   All outgoing liaison statements\
    \ will be copied to IETF Secretariat\n   using procedures defined in [6] or its\
    \ successors.\n   For a liaison statement generated on behalf of an IETF WG, the\
    \ WG\n   chair(s) must create a statement based on appropriate discussions\n \
    \  within the WG to ensure working group consensus for the position(s)\n   presented.\
    \  The chair(s) must have generated or must agree with the\n   sending of the\
    \ liaison statement, and must advise the AD(s) that the\n   liaison statement\
    \ has been sent by copying the appropriate ADs on the\n   message.\n   For a liaison\
    \ statement generated on behalf of an IETF Area, the\n   AD(s) must have generated\
    \ or must agree with the sending of the\n   liaison statement.  If the liaison\
    \ statement is not sent by the ADs,\n   then their agreement must be obtained\
    \ in advance and confirmed by\n   copying the ADs on the message.\n   For a liaison\
    \ statement generated on behalf of the IETF as a whole,\n   the IETF Chair must\
    \ have generated or must agree with the sending of\n   the liaison statement.\
    \  If the liaison statement is not sent by the\n   IETF Chair, then his or her\
    \ agreement must be obtained in advance and\n   confirmed by copying the IETF\
    \ Chair on the message.\n   For a liaison statement generated by the IAB, the\
    \ IAB Chair must have\n   generated or must agree with the sending of the liaison\
    \ statement.\n   If the liaison statement is not sent by the IAB Chair, then his\
    \ or\n   her agreement must be obtained in advance and confirmed by copying\n\
    \   the IAB Chair on the message.\n   In cases where prior agreement was not obtained\
    \ as outlined above,\n   and the designated authority (AD, IETF Chair, or IAB\
    \ Chair) in fact\n   does not agree with the message, the designated authority\
    \ will work\n   with the liaison manager to follow up as appropriate, including\n\
    \   emitting a revised liaison statement if necessary.  Clearly, this is\n   a\
    \ situation best avoided by assuring appropriate agreement in advance\n   of sending\
    \ the liaison message.\n"
