- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   E.164 Number Mapping (ENUM) [1] uses the Domain Name System\
    \ (DNS) [6]\n   to refer from E.164 numbers [7] to Uniform Resource Identifiers\n\
    \   (URIs) [3].  Specific services to be used with ENUM must be\n   registered\
    \ with IANA.  Section 3 of RFC 3761 describes the process of\n   such an Enumservice\
    \ registration.\n   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [9]\
    \ provides\n   means for streaming Extensible Markup Language (XML) [8] elements\n\
    \   between endpoints in close to real time.  The XMPP framework is\n   mainly\
    \ used to provide instant messaging, presence, and streaming\n   media services.\n\
    \   RFC 4622 [5] registers a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for\n  \
    \ identifying an XMPP entity as a URI or as an Internationalized\n   Resource\
    \ Identifier (IRI) [4].  The Enumservice specified in this\n   document allows\
    \ the provisioning of such \"xmpp\" URIs (and the URI\n   representations of \"\
    xmpp\" IRIs) in ENUM.\n"

    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [2].\n"
- title: 3.  Enumservice Registration - XMPP
  contents:
  - "3.  Enumservice Registration - XMPP\n   The following template contains information\
    \ required for the IANA\n   registrations of the 'XMPP' Enumservice, according\
    \ to Section 3 of\n   RFC 3761:\n   Enumservice Name: \"XMPP\"\n   Enumservice\
    \ Type: \"xmpp\"\n   Enumservice Subtype: n/a\n   URI Schemes: \"xmpp\"\n   Functional\
    \ Specification:\n      This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified\

    '
- title: 4.1.  Authority Component
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Authority Component\n   XMPP IRIs/URIs optionally contain an \"Authority\
    \ Component\" (see\n   Section 2.3 of RFC 4622).  The presence of such an Authority\n\
    \   Component in an IRI/URI signals the processing application to\n   authenticate\
    \ as the user indicated in the URI/IRI rather than using\n   the preconfigured\
    \ identity.\n   In the context of this Enumservice, arbitrary clients may discover\n\
    \   and use the XMPP URIs/IRIs associated to an E.164 number.  Hence, in\n   most\
    \ cases, those clients will not be able to authenticate as\n   requested in the\
    \ Authority Component.\n   Therefore, URIs/IRIs that result from processing an\
    \ XMPP Enumservice\n   record SHOULD NOT contain an Authority Component.\n"
- title: 4.2.  IRI-to-URI mapping
  contents:
  - "4.2.  IRI-to-URI mapping\n   While XMPP supports IRIs as well as 'plain' URIs,\
    \ ENUM itself\n   supports only the use of URIs for Enumservices.\n   Therefore,\
    \ XMPP IRIs MUST be mapped to URIs for use in an XMPP\n   Enumservice record.\
    \  The mapping MUST follow the procedures outlined\n   in Section 3.1 of RFC 3987.\n"
- title: 5.  Example
  contents:
  - "5.  Example\n   An example ENUM entry referencing to a XMPP URI could look like:\n\
    \             $ORIGIN 6.9.4.0.6.9.4.5.1.1.4.4.e164.arpa.\n             @  IN NAPTR\
    \  ( 100 10 \"u\"\n                            \"E2U+xmpp\"\n                \
    \            \"!^.*$!xmpp:some-user@example.com!\" .\n                       \
    \   )\n"
- title: 6.  Security and Privacy Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security and Privacy Considerations\n   General security considerations of\
    \ the protocols on which this\n   Enumservice registration is based are addressed\
    \ in Sections 3.1.3 and\n   6 of RFC 3761 (ENUM) and Section 14 of RFC 3920 (XMPP).\n\
    \   Since ENUM uses DNS -- a publicly available database -- any\n   information\
    \ contained in records provisioned in ENUM domains must be\n   considered public\
    \ as well.  Even after revoking the DNS entry and\n   removing the referred resource,\
    \ copies of the information could still\n   be available.\n   Information published\
    \ in ENUM records could reveal associations\n   between E.164 numbers and their\
    \ owners -- especially if IRIs/URIs\n   contain personal identifiers or domain\
    \ names for which ownership\n   information can be obtained easily.\n   However,\
    \ it is important to note that the ENUM record itself does not\n   need to contain\
    \ any personal information.  It just points to a\n   location where access to\
    \ personal information could be granted.\n   ENUM records pointing to third-party\
    \ resources can easily be\n   provisioned on purpose by the ENUM domain owner\
    \ -- so any assumption\n   about the association between a number and an entity\
    \ could therefore\n   be completely bogus unless some kind of identity verification\
    \ is in\n   place.  This verification is out of scope for this memo.\n"
- title: 7.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  IANA Considerations\n   This memo requests IANA to add a new \"XMPP\" Enumservice\
    \ to the\n   'Enumservice Registrations' registry, according to the definitions\
    \ in\n   this document and RFC 3761 [1].\n   The required template is contained\
    \ in Section 3.\n"
