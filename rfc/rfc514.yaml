  - "                           NETWORK MAKE-WORK\n   The ARPA Network seems to have\
    \ developed the proclivity of dragging\n   compulsive collectors and organizers\
    \ out of the woodwork and placing\n   them in the forefront to annoy everybody.\n\
    \   Recent occurrences have been:\n   1. A set of charts on characteristics of\
    \ the hosts.  The orientation\n      seems to have been:  If you can come up with\
    \ names for the\n      horizontal and vertical nodes and if it has to do with\
    \ the hosts,\n      make a chart out of it.  This collection of charts goes under\
    \ the\n      euphemism \"ARPA Network handbook\".  Information on a host is\n\
    \      scattered over all the pages which is a questionable organizing\n     \
    \ scheme.  Additionally, since the charts contain much of what is\n      already\
    \ in the Resource Notebook, we now have the delightful task\n      of maintaining\
    \ two documents when changes are necessary.\n   2. A telephone call asking for\
    \ hourly loads on the TX-2 computer for\n      every hour of the months April\
    \ and May.  One can easily imagine\n      all this information being keypunched\
    \ in some computer (on the\n      network, of course) and then lovely bar graphs,\
    \ curves, plots,\n      etc., being generated.  Probably in triplicate.\n   3.\
    \ A mailbox message about a \"central software repository\" and a\n      personnel\
    \ file. (Copy of the message is attached).  This was just\n      too much and\
    \ is the immediate precursor of this RFC.\n   My first reaction to the \"central\
    \ software repository\" was that this\n   has got to be some kind of prank.  But\
    \ when the second message\n   (identical to the first) arrived an hour later and\
    \ when I learned\n   that others had also received it, I reluctantly accepted\
    \ its\n   legitimacy.  Actually, sending the message in duplicate fits in very\n\
    \   nicely with the general bureaucratic syndrome evidenced by the\n   contents\
    \ of the message.\n   This RFC addresses itself merely to the idea of listings\
    \ of every\n   program.  That does not mean that I think that the rest of the\n\
    \   request is better, just that I don't have the time to write a\n   treatise\
    \ on the general subject.  It should be noted (if not obvious)\n   that what follows\
    \ is being written with almost unbearable restraint.\n   Listings of every program\
    \ available to network users?  Has anybody\n   calculated how much paper would\
    \ be generated?  How many trees would\n   have to be cut down for this paper?\
    \  How many filing cabinets are\n   going to be needed?  How is this massive amount\
    \ of information in its\n   totality going to be of use anyone?  Is there going\
    \ to be an\n   answering service which will answer such questions as to what is\
    \ on\n   the third line of page 5 of the listings of the editor at a given\n \
    \  host?  Will one be \"required\" to send a new listing in order to\n   change\
    \ a program?\n         This material has not been reviewed for public release\
    \ and is\n         intended only for use with the ARPA network.  It should not\
    \ be\n         quoted or cited in any publication not related to the ARPA\n  \
    \       network.\n         plf-2256\n   From the point of view of a site such\
    \ as TX-2, the questions become\n   even more intriguing.  Many of our programs\
    \ are written in assembly\n   language.  Should we, therefore, also send along\
    \ a copy of our\n   (incomplete) assembly language manual?  Or should we drop\
    \ everything\n   else and complete the manual?  What about listings of our operating\n\
    \   system since the programs make calls upon the system for input-\n   output,\
    \ file management, etc.?  (I could go on and on, but the\n   readers should get\
    \ the idea by now.)  Much of this applies to any\n   host, but for a host which\
    \ has a one-and-only computer,the problems\n   are more acute.\n   Once again,\
    \ may I repeat my plea from RFC 459.  There are small\n   research sites on the\
    \ network.  TX-2 is one of them.  Please, network\n   community, don't drown us\
    \ in a sea of make-work.  We might get\n   nothing done just keeping up with it.\
    \  Or is that no longer\n   important?\n   In particular, the network community\
    \ ought to be glad that in the mid\n   1960's we at TX-2 weren't bombarded with\
    \ tons of make-work and were\n   able to get something done.  What I have in mind\
    \ is the initial\n   experimentation with a small-scale network prototype with\
    \ SDC which\n   demonstrated the feasibility of networks and led to the ARPA Network.\n\
    \   (Please see reference.)  Who knows what we, or some other site, will\n   come\
    \ up with if given the chance?\n   Some people have suggested that I not write\
    \ this RFC reasoning that\n   if I just ignore it, the problem will go away. \
    \ But the problem is\n   not going away.  If anything, it seems to be getting\
    \ worse.  Silence\n   becomes in effect tacit consent.  I do not intend to sit\
    \ by and\n   sacrifice useful work to satisfy bureaucratic compulsiveness.\n \
    \  It says someplace that one should end on a positive note.  OK, here\n   goes:\
    \ May I respectfully suggest that the next potential perpetrator\n   of network\
    \ (make) work for someone else think very hard about the\n   justification for\
    \ it.  Also, think about how much time it will take,\n   remembering that not\
    \ everybody is as fast or brilliant as you are.\n   If you would like positive\
    \ responses from others, you should consider\n   why someone else should feel\
    \ motivated to do the work you request.\n   Then put all this down on paper as\
    \ the introduction to the \"work\n   order.\"  Then think some more.  Try it on\
    \ some colleagues.  If it has\n   still survived then maybe you have something.\
    \  Just maybe.\n"
