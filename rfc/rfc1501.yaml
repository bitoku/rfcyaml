  - "Introduction\n   This RFC is being distributed to members of the Internet community\
    \ in\n   order to solicit their reactions to the proposals contained in it.\n\
    \   While the issues discussed may not be directly relevant to the\n   research\
    \ problems of the Internet, they may be interesting to a\n   number of researchers\
    \ and implementers.\n   There is a group called The Phoenix Group which is in\
    \ the process of\n   determining the need for a national OS/2 users' group.  This\
    \ group is\n   targeted for the *individual* user of OS/2, and is designed to\n\
    \   provide an effective vehicle through which users can communicate\n   their\
    \ desires for OS/2 to IBM.  If you work in the corporate\n   Information Technology\
    \ world, you are no doubt familiar with\n   organizations such as SHARE, GUIDE,\
    \ COMMON and DECIUS, among many.\n   These organizations serve as a focal point\
    \ for users, and represent a\n   combined voice to IBM (SHARE, GUIDE and COMMON)\
    \ and Digital Equipment\n   Company (DECIUS).  The intent of these organizations\
    \ is to work\n   closely with their respective hardware/software providers to\n\
    \   influence their direction of their products, be they operating\n   systems\
    \ or CPU's.\n   To this end, many of us in other electronic fora believe that\
    \ there\n   is no representative voice for the end-user of OS/2 with IBM.  Thus,\n\
    \   The Phoenix Group, is taking a straw poll of OS/2 users in many\n   different\
    \ electronic fora to determine the need for, and membership\n   potential for\
    \ such an organization.  The founding council of The\n   Phoenix Group consists\
    \ of the following individuals:\n      Mike Andrews, Eric Brunsen, Max Eidswick,\
    \ Robin Frank,\n      Stan Hawkins, Jack Hiatt, Bob Holmes, Wayne Holmes,\n  \
    \    John Schaeffer, and Toby Pennycuff\n   You may recognize some of the names\
    \ in this group, and you may not.\n   However, we are all long-time users of OS/2,\
    \ and all believe that\n   such an organization is an absolute necessity.  We\
    \ would like to get\n   some gauge of how many people would be willing to become\
    \ a part of\n   such an organization.\n   If we receive a strong response, we\
    \ are prepared to approach IBM\n   PSP's senior management regarding our proposal,\
    \ and work with them to\n   formulate an organization which meets both parties'\
    \ best interests.\n   If you would have an interest in joining such a group, please\
    \ send a\n   note to the following address on the Internet with your name and\n\
    \   address:\n      Z2934@AA1PROFS.IBMMAIL.COM\n          or\n      BRUNSENE@EMAIL.ENMU.EDU\n\
    \   We will compile a database of respondees, and will keep everyone\n   notified\
    \ of our progress electronically.  We all look forward to your\n   comments and\
    \ suggestions.\n"
