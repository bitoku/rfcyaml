  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information\
    \ Base (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n\
    \   It defines a textual convention to represent BCP 47 [RFC4646]\n   language\
    \ tags.\n   The LangTag TEXTUAL-CONVENTION defined by this RFC replaces the\n\
    \   similar LanguageTag TEXTUAL-CONVENTION defined by RFC 2932 [RFC2932].\n  \
    \ The old LanguageTag TEXTUAL-CONVENTION is used by some existing MIB\n   modules.\
    \  New MIB modules should use the LangTag TEXTUAL-CONVENTION,\n   which has been\
    \ created (and is to be preferred) for the following\n   reasons:\n   o  Its syntax\
    \ description is current, and is more comprehensive.\n   o  It is short enough\
    \ to use as an index object without subtyping,\n      yet is of adequate length\
    \ to represent any language tag in\n      practice.\n   o  It is provided in a\
    \ dedicated MIB module to simplify module\n      dependencies.\n   It is not possible\
    \ to apply changes in syntax and length to an\n   existing textual convention.\
    \  This is why the creation of a new\n   textual convention with a new name was\
    \ necessary.\n"

    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\
    \ please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are\
    \ accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information\
    \ Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network\
    \ Management Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms\
    \ defined in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies\
    \ a MIB\n   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n\
    \   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"

    \   DESCRIPTION\n            \"A language tag, constructed in accordance with\
    \ BCP 47.\n            Only lowercase characters are allowed.  The purpose of\
    \ this\n            restriction is to provide unique language tags for use as\n\
    \            indexes.  BCP 47 recommends case conventions for user\n         \
    \   interfaces, but objects using this TEXTUAL-CONVENTION MUST\n            use\
    \ only lowercase.\n            Values MUST be well-formed language tags, in conformance\n\
    \            with the definition of well-formed tags in BCP 47.  An\n        \
    \    implementation MAY further limit the values it accepts to\n            those\
    \ permitted by a 'validating' processor, as defined in\n            BCP 47.\n\
    \            In theory, BCP 47 language tags are of unlimited length.\n      \
    \      The language tag described in this TEXTUAL-CONVENTION is of\n         \
    \   limited length.  The analysis of language tag lengths in BCP\n           \
    \ 47 confirms that this limit will not pose a problem in\n            practice.\
    \  In particular, this length is greater than the\n            minimum requirements\
    \ set out in Section 4.3.1.\n            A zero-length language tag is not a valid\
    \ language tag.\n            This can be used to express 'language tag absent'\
    \ where\n            required, for example, when used as an index field.\"\n \
