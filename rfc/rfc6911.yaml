    \   a Layer 2 Access Node (AN), e.g., a Digital Subscriber Line Access\n   Multiplexer\
    \ (DSLAM); an IP Network Access Server (NAS) (incorporating\n   an Authentication,\

    \      Figure 1\n   In the depicted scenario, the NAS may utilize an IP address\n\
    \   configuration protocol (e.g., DHCPv6) to handle address assignment to\n  \
    \ RGs/hosts.  The RADIUS server authenticates each RG/host and returns\n   the\
    \ Attributes used for authorization and accounting.  These\n   Attributes can\
    \ include a host's IPv6 address, a DNS server address,\n   and a set of IPv6 routes\
    \ to be advertised via any suitable protocol,\n   e.g., ICMPv6 (Neighbor Discovery).\
    \  The name of a prefix pool to be\n   used for DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation or the\
    \ name of an address pool to\n   be used for DHCPv6 address assignment can also\
    \ be Attributes provided\n   to the NAS by the RADIUS AAA server.\n   The following\
    \ subsections discuss how these Attributes are used in\n   more detail.\n"
- title: 2.1.  IPv6 Address Assignment
  contents:
  - "2.1.  IPv6 Address Assignment\n   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] provides a mechanism to assign\
    \ one or more non-\n   temporary IPv6 addresses to hosts.  To provide a DHCPv6\
    \ server\n   residing on a NAS with one or more IPv6 addresses to be assigned,\n\
    \   this document specifies the Framed-IPv6-Address Attribute\n   (Section 3.1).\n\
    \   While [RFC3162] permits the specification of an IPv6 address via the\n   combination\
    \ of the Framed-Interface-Id and Framed-IPv6-Prefix\n   Attributes, this separation\
    \ is more natural for use with PPP's IPv6\n   Control Protocol than it is for\
    \ use with DHCPv6, and the use of a\n   single IPv6 address Attribute makes for\
    \ easier processing of\n   accounting records.\n   Because DHCPv6 can be deployed\
    \ on the same network as ICMPv6\n   stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC)\
    \ [RFC4862], it is possible\n   that the NAS will require both stateful and stateless\
    \ configuration\n   information.  Therefore, it is possible for the Framed-IPv6-Address,\n\
    \   Framed-IPv6-Prefix, and Framed-Interface-Id Attributes [RFC3162] to\n   be\
    \ included within the same packet.  To avoid ambiguity in this case,\n   the Framed-IPv6-Address\
    \ Attribute is intended for authorization and\n   accounting of DHCPv6-assigned\
    \ addresses, and the Framed-IPv6-Prefix\n   and Framed-Interface-Id Attributes\
    \ are used for authorization and\n   accounting of addresses assigned via SLAAC.\n"
- title: 2.2.  DNS Servers
  contents:
  - "2.2.  DNS Servers\n   DHCPv6 provides an option for configuring a host with the\
    \ IPv6\n   address of a DNS server.  The IPv6 address of a DNS server can also\n\
    \   be conveyed to the host using ICMPv6 with Router Advertisements, via\n   the\
    \ Recursive DNS Server Option [RFC6106].  To provide the NAS with\n   the IPv6\
    \ address of one or more DNS servers, this document specifies\n   the DNS-Server-IPv6-Address\
    \ Attribute (Section 3.2).\n"
- title: 2.3.  IPv6 Route Information
  contents:
  - "2.3.  IPv6 Route Information\n   The IPv6 Route Information Option [RFC4191],\
    \ is intended to be used\n   to inform a host connected to the NAS that a specific\
    \ route is\n   reachable via any given NAS.\n   This document specifies the Route-IPv6-Information\
    \ Attribute\n   (Section 3.3) that allows the AAA server to provision the\n  \
    \ announcement by the NAS of a specific Route Information Option to an\n   accessing\
    \ host.  The NAS may advertise this route using the method\n   defined in RFC\
    \ 4191 or other equivalent methods.  Any other\n   information, such as preference\
    \ or lifetime values, that is to be\n   present in the actual announcement using\
    \ a given method is assumed to\n   be determined by the NAS using means not specified\
    \ by this document\n   (e.g., local configuration on the NAS).\n   While the Framed-IPv6-Prefix\
    \ Attribute ([RFC3162], Section 2.3)\n   allows the route to be advertised in\
    \ an RA, it cannot be used to\n   configure more specific routes.  While the Framed-IPv6-Route\n\
    \   Attribute ([RFC3162], Section 2.5) causes the route to be configured\n   on\
    \ the NAS and potentially to be announced via an IP routing\n   protocol, depending\
    \ on the value of Framed-Routing, it does not\n   result in the route being announced\
    \ in an RA.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Delegated IPv6 Prefix Pool
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Delegated IPv6 Prefix Pool\n   DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (DHCPv6-PD) [RFC3633]\
    \ involves a delegating\n   router selecting a prefix and delegating it on a temporary\
    \ basis to a\n   requesting router.  The delegating router may implement a number\
    \ of\n   strategies as to how it chooses what prefix is to be delegated to a\n\
    \   requesting router, one of them being the use of a local named prefix\n   pool.\
    \  The Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool Attribute (Section 3.4) allows\n   the RADIUS\
    \ server to convey a prefix pool name to a NAS that is\n   hosting a DHCPv6-PD\
    \ server and that is acting as a delegating router.\n   Because DHCPv6 Prefix\
    \ Delegation can be used with SLAAC on the same\n   network, it is possible for\
    \ the Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool and\n   Framed-IPv6-Pool Attributes to be included\
    \ within the same packet.\n   To avoid ambiguity in this scenario, use of the\
    \ Delegated-IPv6-\n   Prefix-Pool Attribute should be restricted to authorization\
    \ and\n   accounting of prefix pools used in DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation, and the\n\
    \   Framed-IPv6-Pool Attribute should be used for authorization and\n   accounting\
    \ of prefix pools used in SLAAC.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Stateful IPv6 Address Pool
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Stateful IPv6 Address Pool\n   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] provides a mechanism to\
    \ assign one or more non-\n   temporary IPv6 addresses to hosts.  Section 3.1\
    \ introduces the\n   Framed-IPv6-Address Attribute to be used to provide a DHCPv6\
    \ server\n   residing on a NAS with one or more IPv6 addresses to be assigned\
    \ to\n   the clients.  An alternative way to achieve a similar result is for\n\
    \   the NAS to select the IPv6 address to be assigned from an address\n   pool\
    \ configured for this purpose on the NAS.  This document specifies\n   the Stateful-IPv6-Address-Pool\
    \ Attribute (Section 3.5) to allow the\n   RADIUS server to convey a pool name\
    \ to be used for such stateful\n   DHCPv6-based addressing and for any subsequent\
    \ accounting.\n"

    \   to the Attributes defined in this document.  A trust relationship\n   between\
