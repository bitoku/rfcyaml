  - "1.  Introduction\n   As defined in [RFC1195] and extended in [RFC3784], the IS-IS
    protocol\n   [ISO10589] may be used to distribute IPv4 prefix reachability\n   information
    throughout an IS-IS domain.  In addition, thanks to\n   extensions made in [RFC5120]
    and [ISIS-IPv6], IS-IS may be used to\n   distribute IPv6 reachability information.\n
    \  The IPv4 prefix information is encoded as TLV type 128 and 130 in\n   [RFC1195],
    with additional information carried in TLV 135 as\n   specified in [RFC3784] and
    TLV 235 as defined in [RFC5120].  In\n   particular, the extended IP Reachability
    TLV (TLV 135) contains\n   support for a larger metric space, an up/down bit to
    indicate\n   redistribution between different levels in the hierarchy, an IP\n
    \  prefix, and one or more sub-TLVs that can be used to carry specific\n   information
    about the prefix.  TLV 235 is a derivative of TLV 135,\n   with the addition of
    Multi-Topology membership information [RFC5120].\n   The IPv6 prefix information
    is encoded as TLV 236 in [ISIS-IPv6], and\n   TLV 237 in [RFC5120].\n   This document
    defines 2 new sub-TLVs for TLV 135, TLV 235, TLV 236\n   and TLV 237 that may
    be used to carry administrative information\n   about an IP prefix.\n"

    sub-TLVs to be added\n   to TLV 135, TLV 235, TLV 236 and TLV 237.  These TLVs
    specify one or\n   more 32- or 64-bit unsigned integers that may be associated
    with an\n   IP prefix.  Example uses of these tags include carrying BGP standard\n
    \  (or extended) communities and controlling redistribution between\n   levels
    and areas, different routing protocols, or multiple instances\n   of IS-IS running
    on the same router.\n   The methods for which their use is employed is beyond
    the scope of\n   this document and left to the implementer and/or operator.\n
    \  The encoding of the sub-TLV(s) is discussed in the following\n   subsections.\n"

  - "4.  Ordering of Tags\n   The semantics of the tag order are implementation-dependent.
    \ That\n   is, there is no implied meaning to the ordering of the tags that\n
    \  indicates a certain operation or set of operations need be performed\n   based
    on the order of the tags.  Each tag SHOULD be treated as an\n   autonomous identifier
    that MAY be used in policy to perform a policy\n   action.  Whether or not tag
    A precedes or succeeds tag B SHOULD not\n   change the meaning of the tag set.
    \ However, when propagating TLVs\n   that contain multiple tags between levels,
    an implementation SHOULD\n   preserve the ordering such that the first tag remains
    the first tag,\n   so that implementations that only recognize a single tag will
    have a\n   consistent view across levels.\n   Each IS that receives an LSP with
    TLV(s) 135 and/or 235 and/or 236\n   and/or 237, that have associated sub-TLV(s)
    1 and/or 2, MAY operate\n   on the tag values as warranted by the implementation.
    \ If an\n   implementation needs to change tag values, for example, when\n   propagating
    TLVs between levels at an area boundary, then the TLV(s)\n   SHOULD be copied
    to the newly generated Level-1 or Level-2 LSP.  At\n   that point, the contents
    of the sub-TLV(s) MAY change as dictated by\n   the policy action.  In the event
    that no change is required, the sub-\n   TLV(s) SHOULD be copied in order into
    the new LSP, such that ordering\n   is preserved.\n"

  - "5.  Compliance\n   A compliant IS-IS implementation MUST be able to assign one
    tag to\n   any IP prefix in any of the following TLVs: TLV 135, TLV 235, TLV\n
    \  236, TLV 237.  It MUST be able to interpret a single tag present in\n   the
    sub-TLV, or the first tag where there is more than one tag\n   present in the
    sub-TLV.\n   A compliant IS-IS implementation MAY be able to assign more than
    one\n   tag to any IP prefix in any of the following TLVs: TLV 135, TLV 235,\n
    \  TLV 236, TLV 237.  It MAY be able to interpret the second and\n   subsequent
    tags where more than one tag is present in the sub-TLV.\n   When propagating TLVs
    between levels, a compliant IS-IS\n   implementation MAY be able to rewrite or
    remove one or more tags\n   associated with a prefix in any of the following TLVs:
    TLV 135, TLV\n   235, TLV 236, TLV 237.\n"

  - "6.  Operations\n   An administrator associates an Administrative Tag value with
    some\n   interesting property.  When IS-IS advertises reachability for some IP\n
    \  prefix that has that property, it adds the Administrative Tag to the\n   IP
    reachability information TLV for that prefix, and the tag \"sticks\"\n   to the
    prefix as it is flooded throughout the routing domain.\n   Consider the network
    in Figure 1.  We wish to \"leak\" L1 prefixes\n   [RFC2966] with some property,
    A, from L2 to the L1 router R1.\n   Without policy groups, there is no way for
    R2 to know property A\n   prefixes from property B prefixes.\n                        R2--------R3--------R4\n
    \                L2     /                    \\\n                 - - - /- - -
    - - - - - - - - - - -\n                 L1   /                        \\\n                    R1----1.1.1.0/24
    (A)       R5\n                                                |\n                                                |\n
    \                                         1.1.2.0/24 (B)\n                        Figure
    1: Example of usage\n   We associate Administrative Tag 100 with property A, and
    have R5\n   attach that value to the IP extended reachability information TLV
    for\n   prefix 1.1.2.0/24.  R2 has a policy in place to \"match prefixes with\n
    \  Administrative Tag 100, and leak to L1\".\n   The previous example is rather
    simplistic; it seems that it would be\n   just as easy for R2 simply to match
    the prefix 1.1.2.0/24.  However,\n   if there are a large number of routers that
    need to apply some policy\n   according to property A and a large number of \"A\"
    prefixes, this\n   mechanism can be quite helpful.\n   Implementations that support
    only a single tag and those that support\n   multiple tags may coexist in the
    same IS-IS domain.  An\n   implementation supporting multiple tags SHOULD therefore
    assign any\n   tag that is required to be interpreted by all systems as the first\n
    \  tag in any set of multiple tags.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This document raises no new security issues for
    IS-IS, as any\n   annotations to IP prefixes should not pass outside the administrative\n
    \  control of the network operator of the IS-IS domain.  Such an\n   allowance
    would violate the spirit of Interior Gateway Protocols in\n   general and IS-IS
    in particular.\n"

    Tag\n   Sub-TLV.\n"
