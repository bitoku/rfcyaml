- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines how label-switching-controlled Frame-Relay\n\
    \   [RFC3034] and ATM [RFC3035] interfaces can be realized given the\n   interface\
    \ stacking as defined in the MPLS-LSR-STD [RFC3813] and\n   MPLS-TE-STD [RFC3812]\
    \ MIBs.  This document also contains a MIB module\n   that sparsely extends the\
    \ MPLS-LSR-STD MIB's mplsInterfaceConfTable\n   in such a way as to identify which\
    \ MPLS-type interfaces have LC-ATM\n   or LC-FR capabilities.  Comments should\
    \ be made directly to the MPLS\n   mailing list at mpls@uu.net.\n   The key words\
    \ \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\"\
    , \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document\
    \ are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119, reference\n   [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   This document uses terminology from the document describing\
    \ the MPLS\n   architecture [RFC3031], as well as from RFC 3035 and RFC 3034.\n\
    \   Specifically, the following terms will be used in this document.\n   C-FR\
    \  RFC 3034 defines a label-switching-controlled Frame Relay\n         (LC-FR)\
    \ interface.  Packets traversing such an interface carry\n         labels in the\
    \ DLCI field\n   C-ATM RFC 3035 defines a label-switching-controlled ATM (LC-ATM)\n\
    \         interface as an ATM interface controlled by the label switching\n  \
    \       control component.  When a packet traversing such an interface\n     \
    \    is received, it is treated as a labeled packet.  The packet's\n         top\
    \ label is inferred from either the contents of the Virtual\n         Channel\
    \ Identifier (VCI) field or the combined contents of the\n         Virtual Path\
    \ Identifier (VPI) and VCI fields.  Any two LDP\n         peers that are connected\
    \ via an LC-ATM interface will use LDP\n         negotiations to determine which\
    \ of these cases is applicable to\n         that interface.  Static configuration\
    \ of labels is also\n         possible.\n   When LDP is used to distribute labels\
    \ for use on label-controlled\n   interfaces, label configuration information\
    \ may be available in the\n   MPLS-LDP-ATM-STD-MIB [RFC3815] when LC-ATM interfaces\
    \ are used, or\n   the MPLS-LDP-FRAME-RELAY-STD-MIB [RFC3815] when LC-FR interfaces\
    \ are\n   used.\n"
- title: 3.  The SNMP Management Framework
  contents:
  - "3.  The SNMP Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of the documents\
    \ that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please\
    \ refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed\
    \ via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base\
    \ or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management\
    \ Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined\
    \ in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a\
    \ MIB\n   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n\
    \   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"
- title: 4.  Interface Stacking of LC-ATM
  contents:
  - "4.  Interface Stacking of LC-ATM\n   Since LC-ATM interfaces [RFC2863] can carry\
    \ labeled MPLS traffic,\n   they too are considered MPLS subinterfaces with ifType\
    \ = mpls(166).\n   They differ slightly in their capability from a packet-oriented\
    \ MPLS\n   interface in that they may carry ATM- or Frame-Relay-encapsulated\n\
    \   traffic.  It is thus beneficial to identify them as such.  To do\n   this,\
    \ two tables are defined that extend the MPLS-LSR-STD MIB's\n   mplsInterfaceTable\
    \ (see section 5 for LC-ATM or section 6 for LC-FR).\n"
- title: 5.  Structure of the MPLS-LC-ATM-STD-MIB Module
  contents:
  - "5.  Structure of the MPLS-LC-ATM-STD-MIB Module\n   The MPLS-LC-ATM-STD-MIB module\
    \ is structured simply as a table of\n   entries that sparsely extend those found\
    \ in the interfaces table.  In\n   particular, the entries in the mplsLcAtmStdInterfaceConfTable\
    \ extend\n   interfaces capable of supporting MPLS, as is defined in [RFC3813],\
    \ to\n   include entries that also support LC-ATM (and their unique\n   attributes).\
    \  Therefore, the module can be visualized as follows.\n   Note that the ifTable\
    \ comes from [RFC2863], the mplsInterfaceTable\n   from [RFC3813], and the mplsLcAtmStdInterfaceConfTable\
    \ from the\n   MPLS-LC-ATM-STD-MIB module described below.\n   ifTable mplsInterfaceTable\
    \ mplsLcAtmStdInterfaceConfTable\n   .1\n   .2       .2\n   .3\n   .4       .4\
    \                .4\n   .5\n   In the example shown above, five interfaces exist\
    \ on the device in\n   question.  Of those interfaces, those with ifIndex = .2\
    \ and .4 are of\n   ifType = mpls(166) indicating that they are capable of MPLS.\
    \  Of\n   those two, the entry with index .4 is capable of MPLS LC-ATM\n   operations.\n\
    \   Note that the label partition model utilized by the authors of this\n   document\
    \ reflects widespread implementation and is seen by the MPLS\n   working group\
    \ as sufficiently flexible to meet the operational needs,\n   even if it is more\
    \ restrictive than [RFC3035] allows.  To this end,\n   we have limited the control\
    \ and unlabeled VPI and VCI to single\n   values.  Note that mplsLcAtmStdUnlabTrafVci\
    \ and mplsLcAtmStdCtrlVci\n   MUST not be equal; nor should mplsLcAtmStdCtrlVpi\
    \ or\n   mplsLcAtmStdUnlabTrafVpi be equal.\n"

  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   It is clear that these MIB modules are potentially\
    \ useful for\n   monitoring MPLS LSRs supporting LC-ATM and/or LC-FR.  These MIBs\
    \ can\n   also be used for configuration of certain objects, and anything that\n\
    \   can be configured can be incorrectly configured, with potentially\n   disastrous\
    \ results.\n   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module\n\
    \   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such\n   objects\
    \ may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n   environments.\
    \  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment without proper\
    \ protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.  These are\
    \ the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   o    the\
    \ MplsLcAtmStdInterfaceConfTable and\n        mplsLcFrStdInterfaceConfTable collectively\
    \ contain objects that\n        may be used to provision MPLS LC or FR-enabled\
    \ interfaces.\n        Unauthorized access to objects in these tables could result\
    \ in\n        disruption of traffic on the network.  This is especially true\n\
    \        if traffic has been established over these interfaces.  The use\n   \
    \     of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be\n        considered\
    \ where possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM\n        MUST be used with\
    \ any v3 agent that implements this MIB module.\n        Administrators should\
    \ consider whether read access to these\n        objects should be allowed, since\
    \ read access may be undesirable\n        under certain circumstances.\n   Some\
    \ of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS\
    \ other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in\
    \ some network environments.  It is thus important to\n   control even GET and/or\
    \ NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of\
    \ these objects when sending them over\n   the network via SNMP.  These are the\
    \ tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   o    the MplsLcAtmStdInterfaceConfTable\
    \ and\n        mplsLcFrStdInterfaceConfTable collectively show the LC-ATM\n  \
    \      and/or LC-FR interfaces, their associated configurations, and\n       \
    \ their linkages to other MPLS-related configuration and/or\n        performance\
    \ statistics.  Administrators not wishing to reveal\n        this information\
    \ should consider these objects\n        sensitive/vulnerable and take precautions\
    \ so they are not\n        revealed.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not\
    \ include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example\
    \ by using IPSec),\n   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure\
    \ network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the\

    \ the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410],\
    \ section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms\
    \ (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions\

    \   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance\
    \ of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects\
    \ only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET\
