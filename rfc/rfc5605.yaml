  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes a model for managing \"emulated\"\
    \ ATM services\n   over a Packet Switched Network (PSN).\n   The document follows\
    \ the requirements for Pseudowire Emulation Edge-\n   to-Edge [PWREQ]; it is closely\
    \ related to [ATMENCAP] and [ATMTRANS],\n   which describe the encapsulation of\
    \ ATM signals and provide the\n   Emulation Service over a Packet Switched Network.\n\
    \   The ATM management model consists of several MIB modules, following\n   the\
    \ layering model described in the PWE3 Architecture [PWARCH]\n   document.  The\
    \ ATM MIB module described in this document works\n   closely with the MIB modules\
    \ described in [AToMTC], [AToM], [IFMIB],\n   [PWMIB], and the textual conventions\
    \ defined in [PWTC].  The\n   conceptual layering and relationship among all of\
    \ those is described\n   in Figure 1 and in the \"Relation to Other PW-MIB Modules\"\
    \ section\n   listed below.  An ATM connection will be a pseudowire (PW)\n   connection.\
    \  It will not be treated as an interface and will\n   therefore not be represented\
    \ in the ifTable.\n                       Figure 1: Conceptual Layering\n    \

  - "3.  Terminology\n  This document follows the terminology used in PW Architecture\n\
    \  [PWARCH].\n  PSN-bound           References the traffic direction where an\
    \ ATM Cell\n                      is received, adapted to the packet, assigned\
    \ a PW\n                      label, and sent into the PSN.  Within the MIB\n\
    \                      objects, it is called outbound.\n  CE-bound           \
    \ The direction where packets are received\n                      from the PSN,\
    \ cells are reconstructed from the\n                      packet payloads, and\
    \ are sent into the ATM network\n                      as cells.  Within the MIB\

    \ protocol such that it can be\n                      carried by a packet switched\
    \ net (the PSN).  For\n                      example, in an ATM service, the foreign\
    \ protocol\n                      is ATM.  The PSN may be MPLS.\n  PSN       \
    \          Packet Switched Network.\n  PSN Tunnel          A general term indicating\
    \ a virtual connection\n                      between the two PW edge devices.\
    \  In practice,\n                      this connection is not limited to path-oriented\n\
    \                      types of PSNs such as MPLS.  An example of a non-\n   \
    \                   path-oriented PSN is an IP PSN.\n"

- title: 6.  Relation to Other PW-MIB Modules
  contents:
  - "6.  Relation to Other PW-MIB Modules\n   The MIB structure for defining a PW\
    \ service is composed of three\n   layers of MIB modules functioning together.\
    \  This general model is\n   defined in the PWE3 Architecture [PWARCH].  The layering\
    \ model is\n   intended to sufficiently isolate PW services from the underlying\
    \ PSN\n   layer that carries the emulated service.  This is done at the same\n\
    \   time as providing a standard means for connecting any supported\n   services\
    \ to any supported PSNs.\n   The first layer, known as the service layer, contains\
    \ service-\n   specific modules such as the one defined in this document.  These\n\
    \   modules define service-specific management objects that interface or\n   collaborate\
    \ with existing MIB modules for the native version of the\n   service.  The service-specific\
    \ module \"glues\" the standard module to\n   the PWE MIB framework.\n   The next\
    \ layer of the PWE MIB framework is comprised of the PW-MIB\n   module [PWMIB].\
    \  This module is used to configure general parameters\n   of PW connections that\
    \ are common to all types of emulated services\n   and PSNs.  This layer is connected\
    \ to the service-specific layer\n   above, and the PSN layer below.\n   The PSN\
    \ layer provides PSN-specific modules for each type of PSN.\n   These modules\
    \ associate the PW with one or more \"tunnels\" that carry\n   the service over\
    \ the PSN.  These modules are defined in other\n   documents.  This module is\
    \ used to \"glue\" the PW service to the\n   underlying PSN-specific MIB modules.\
    \  In the case of MPLS, for\n   example, the PW-MPLS MIB [PWMPLSMIB] is used to\
    \ connect the PW\n   service to either the MPLS-LDP [LDPMIB] or MPLS-TE [TEMIB]\
    \ MIBs.\n   [PWTC] defines some of the object types used in these modules.\n"
- title: 7.  ATM-PW MIB Usage
  contents:
  - "7.  ATM-PW MIB Usage\n   This section provides an example of using the MIB objects\
    \ described\n   in section 9 to set up an ATM PW.  While this example is not meant\
    \ to\n   illustrate every permutation of the MIB, it is intended as an aid in\n\
    \   the understanding of some key concepts.  It is meant to be read after\n  \
    \ going through the MIB itself.  See [PWMIB] for an example of setting\n   up\
    \ a PSN Tunnel.\n   The following example illustrates how a user will set up an\
    \ ATM\n   Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5) ATM PW on a switch/router with cells\n   entering\
    \ the switch/router through ATM Interface with IfIndex 1000\n   [IFMIB], Virtual\
    \ Path Identifier (VPI) 1 and Virtual Circuit\n   Identifier (VCI) 100 (from an\
    \ ATM network to a PSN -- outbound\n   direction) and on the way back, it goes\
    \ out of the switch/router\n   through ATM Interface 1000 with VPI 1 and VCI 100\
    \ (PSN to ATM network\n   -- inbound direction).\n   First create an entry in\
    \ the PW MIB with pwType atmAal5SduVcc(2),\n   then create entries in the pwAtmCfg\

  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.\
    \  Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n\
    \   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment\
    \ without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.\
    \  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n\
    \   The pwAtmOutboundTable, pwAtmInboundTable, pwAtmCfgTable,\n   pwAtmOutboundNto1Table,\
    \ and pwAtmInboundNto1Table contain objects of\n   ATM PW parameters on a Provider\
    \ Edge (PE) device.  Unauthorized\n   access to objects in these tables could\
    \ result in disruption of\n   traffic on the network.\n   The use of stronger\
    \ mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be\n   considered where possible.\
    \  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be\n   used with any SNMPV3 agent, which\
    \ implements this MIB module.\n   Administrators should consider whether read\
    \ access to these objects\n   should be allowed, since read access may be undesirable\
    \ under certain\n   circumstances.\n   Some of the readable objects in this MIB\
    \ module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be\
    \ considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is\
    \ thus important to\n   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects\
    \ and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them\
    \ over\n   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their\n\
    \   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   The pwATMCfgTable, pwAtmPerfCurrentTable, pwAtmPerfIntervalTable,\
    \ and\n   pwAtmPerf1DayIntervalTable collectively show the ATM pseudowire\n  \
    \ connectivity topology and its performance characteristics.\n   If an Administrator\
    \ does not want to reveal this information, then\n   these tables should be considered\
    \ sensitive/vulnerable.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate\
    \ security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n\
    \   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is\n   allowed\
    \ to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n   in this MIB\
    \ module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features\
    \ as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including\
    \ full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication\
    \ and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n\
    \   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable\
    \ cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to\
    \ ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module\
    \ is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals\
    \ (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)\
    \ them.\n"
