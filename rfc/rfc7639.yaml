- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The HTTP CONNECT method (Section 4.3.6 of [RFC7231]) requests\
    \ that\n   the recipient establish a tunnel to the identified origin server and\n\
    \   thereafter forward packets, in both directions, until the tunnel is\n   closed.\
    \  Such tunnels are commonly used to create end-to-end virtual\n   connections\
    \ through one or more proxies.\n   The ALPN HTTP header field identifies the protocol\
    \ or protocols that\n   the client intends to use within a tunnel that is established\
    \ using\n   CONNECT.  This uses the Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)\n\
    \   identifier [RFC7301].\n   For a tunnel that is then secured using Transport\
    \ Layer Security\n   (TLS) [RFC5246], the header field carries the same application\n\
    \   protocol label as will be carried within the TLS handshake [RFC7301].\n  \
    \ If there are multiple possible application protocols, all of those\n   application\
    \ protocols are indicated.\n   The ALPN header field carries an indication of\
    \ client intent only.\n   An ALPN identifier is used here only to identify the\
    \ application\n   protocol or suite of protocols that the client intends to use\
    \ in the\n   tunnel.  No negotiation takes place using this header field.  In\
    \ TLS,\n   the final choice of application protocol is made by the server from\n\
    \   the set of choices presented by the client.  Other substrates could\n   negotiate\
    \ the application protocol differently.\n   Proxies do not implement the tunneled\
    \ protocol, though they might\n   choose to make policy decisions based on the\
    \ value of the header\n   field.  For example, a proxy could use the application\
    \ protocol to\n   select appropriate traffic prioritization.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  The ALPN HTTP Header Field
  contents:
  - "2.  The ALPN HTTP Header Field\n   Clients include the ALPN header field in an\
    \ HTTP CONNECT request to\n   indicate the application-layer protocol that a client\
    \ intends to use\n   within the tunnel, or a set of protocols that might be used\
    \ within\n   the tunnel.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Header Field Values
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Header Field Values\n   Valid values for the protocol field are taken from\
    \ the \"Application-\n   Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol ID\" registry\
    \ [ALPN-IDS]\n   established by [RFC7301].\n"
- title: 2.2.  Syntax
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Syntax\n   The ABNF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form) syntax for the ALPN header\n\
    \   field value is given below.  It uses the syntax defined in\n   Section 1.2\
    \ of [RFC7230].\n   ALPN            = 1#protocol-id\n   protocol-id     = token\
    \ ; percent-encoded ALPN protocol identifier\n   ALPN protocol names are octet\
    \ sequences with no additional\n   constraints on format.  Octets not allowed\
    \ in tokens ([RFC7230],\n   Section 3.2.6) MUST be percent-encoded as per Section\
    \ 2.1 of\n   [RFC3986].  Consequently, the octet representing the percent\n  \
    \ character \"%\" (hex 25) MUST be percent-encoded as well.\n   In order to have\
    \ precisely one way to represent any ALPN protocol\n   name, the following additional\
    \ constraints apply:\n   o  Octets in the ALPN protocol MUST NOT be percent-encoded\
    \ if they\n      are valid token characters except \"%\".\n   o  When using percent-encoding,\
    \ uppercase hex digits MUST be used.\n   With these constraints, recipients can\
    \ apply simple string comparison\n   to match protocol identifiers.\n   For example:\n\
    \     CONNECT www.example.com HTTP/1.1\n     Host: www.example.com\n     ALPN:\
    \ h2, http%2F1.1\n"
- title: 2.3.  Usage
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Usage\n   When used in the ALPN header field, an ALPN identifier is used\
    \ to\n   identify an entire application protocol stack, not a single protocol\n\
    \   layer or component.\n   For a CONNECT tunnel that conveys a protocol secured\
    \ with TLS, the\n   value of the ALPN header field contains the same list of ALPN\n\
    \   identifiers that will be sent in the TLS ClientHello message\n   [RFC7301].\n\
    \   Where no protocol negotiation is expected to occur, such as in\n   protocols\
    \ that do not use TLS, the ALPN header field contains a\n   single ALPN protocol\
    \ identifier corresponding to the application\n   protocol that is intended to\
    \ be used.  If an alternative form of\n   protocol negotiation is possible, the\
    \ ALPN header field contains the\n   set of protocols that might be negotiated.\n\
    \   A proxy can use the value of the ALPN header field to more cleanly\n   and\
    \ efficiently reject requests for a CONNECT tunnel.  Exposing\n   protocol information\
    \ at the HTTP layer allows a proxy to deny\n   requests earlier, with better error\
    \ reporting (such as a 403 status\n   code).  The ALPN header field can be falsified\
    \ and therefore is not a\n   sufficient basis for authorizing a request.\n   A\
    \ proxy could attempt to inspect packets to determine the protocol in\n   use.\
    \  This requires that the proxy understand each ALPN identifier.\n   Protocols\
    \ like TLS could hide negotiated protocols, or protocol\n   negotiation details\
    \ could change over time.  Proxies SHOULD NOT break\n   a CONNECT tunnel solely\
    \ on the basis of a failure to recognize the\n   protocol.\n   A proxy can use\
    \ the ALPN header field value to change how it manages\n   or prioritizes connections.\n"
- title: 3.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   HTTP header fields are registered within the \"Permanent\
    \ Message\n   Header Field Names\" registry maintained by IANA [MSG-HDRS].  This\n\
    \   document defines and registers the ALPN header field, according to\n   [RFC3864]\
    \ as follows:\n   Header Field Name:  ALPN\n   Protocol:  http\n   Status:  Standard\n\
    \   Reference:  Section 2 of this document (RFC 7639)\n   Change Controller: \
    \ IETF (iesg@ietf.org) - Internet Engineering Task\n      Force\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   In case of using HTTP CONNECT to a TURN (Traversal\
    \ Using Relays\n   around NAT, [RFC5766]) server, the security considerations\
    \ of\n   Section 4.3.6 of [RFC7231] apply.  It states that there \"are\n   significant\
    \ risks in establishing a tunnel to arbitrary servers,\n   particularly when the\
    \ destination is a well-known or reserved TCP\n   port that is not intended for\
    \ Web traffic. ... Proxies that support\n   CONNECT SHOULD restrict its use to\
    \ a limited set of known ports or a\n   configurable whitelist of safe request\
    \ targets.\"\n   The ALPN header field described in this document is OPTIONAL.\n\
    \   Clients and HTTP proxies could choose not to support it and therefore\n  \
    \ either fail to provide it or ignore it when present.  If the header\n   field\
    \ is not available or is ignored, a proxy cannot identify the\n   purpose of the\
    \ tunnel and use this as input to any authorization\n   decision regarding the\
    \ tunnel.  This is indistinguishable from the\n   case where either client or\
    \ proxy does not support the ALPN header\n   field.\n   There is no confidentiality\
    \ protection for the ALPN header field.\n   ALPN identifiers that might expose\
    \ confidential or sensitive\n   information SHOULD NOT be sent, as described in\
    \ Section 5 of\n   [RFC7301].\n   The value of the ALPN header field could be\
    \ falsified by a client.\n   If the data being sent through the tunnel is encrypted\
    \ (for example,\n   with TLS [RFC5246]), then the proxy might not be able to directly\n\
    \   inspect the data to verify that the claimed protocol is the one which\n  \
    \ is actually being used, though a proxy might be able to perform\n   traffic\
    \ analysis [TRAFFIC].  Therefore, a proxy cannot rely on the\n   value of the\
    \ ALPN header field as a policy input in all cases.\n"
