  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes how access networks, Session Initiation\n\
    \   Protocol [RFC3261] user agents, proxy servers, and Public Safety\n   Answering\
    \ Points (PSAPs) support emergency calling, as outlined in\n   [RFC6443], which\
    \ is designed to complement the present document in\n   section headings, numbering,\
    \ and content.  Understanding [RFC6443] is\n   necessary to understand this document.\
    \  This Best Current Practice\n   (BCP) succinctly describes the requirements\
    \ of end devices and\n   applications (requirements prefaced by \"ED-\"), access\
    \ networks\n   (including enterprise access networks) (requirements prefaced by\n\
    \   \"AN-\"), service providers (requirements prefaced by \"SP-\"), and PSAPs\n\
    \   to achieve globally interoperable emergency calling on the Internet.\n   This\
    \ document also defines requirements for \"intermediate\" devices\n   that exist\
    \ between end devices or applications and the access\n   network.  For example,\
    \ a home router is an intermediate device.\n   Reporting location on an emergency\
    \ call (see Section 6) may depend on\n   the ability of such intermediate devices\
    \ to meet the requirements\n   prefaced by \"INT-\".\n   The access network requirements\
    \ apply to those networks that may be\n   used to place emergency calls using\
    \ IETF protocols.  Local\n   regulations may impact the need to support this document's\
    \ access\n   network requirements.\n   Other organizations, such as the National\
    \ Emergency Number\n   Association (NENA), define the PSAP interface.  NENA's\
    \ documents\n   reference this document.\n"

- title: 3.  Overview of How Emergency Calls Are Placed
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview of How Emergency Calls Are Placed\n   An emergency call can be distinguished\
    \ (Section 5) from any other\n   call by a unique service URN [RFC5031] that is\
    \ placed in the call\n   setup signaling when a home or visited emergency dial\
    \ string is\n   detected.  Because emergency services are local to specific\n\
    \   geographic regions, a caller must obtain his location (Section 6)\n   prior\
    \ to making emergency calls.  To get this location, either a form\n   of measuring\
    \ (e.g., GPS) ([RFC6443] Section 6.2.3) device location in\n   the endpoint is\
    \ deployed or the endpoint is configured (Section 6.5)\n   with its location from\
    \ the access network's Location Information\n   Server (LIS).  The location is\
    \ conveyed (Section 6.7) in the SIP\n   signaling with the call.  The call is\
    \ routed (Section 8) based on\n   location using the Location-to-Service Translation\
    \ (LoST) protocol\n   [RFC5222], which maps a location to a set of PSAP URIs.\
    \  Each URI\n   resolves to a PSAP or an Emergency Services Routing Proxy (ESRP)\
    \ that\n   serves a group of PSAPs.  The call arrives at the PSAP with the\n \
    \  location included in the SIP INVITE request.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Which Devices and Services Should Support Emergency Calls?\n   ED-1:  A device\
    \ or application that implements SIP calling SHOULD\n      support emergency calling.\
    \  Some jurisdictions have regulations\n      governing which devices need to\
    \ support emergency calling, and\n      developers are encouraged to ensure that\
    \ devices they develop meet\n      relevant regulatory requirements.  Unfortunately,\
    \ the natural\n      variation in those regulations also makes it impossible to\n\
    \      accurately describe the cases when developers do or do not have to\n  \
    \    support emergency calling.\n   SP-1:  If a device or application expects\
    \ to be able to place a call\n      for help, the service provider that supports\
    \ it MUST facilitate\n      emergency calling.  Some jurisdictions have regulations\
    \ governing\n      this.\n   ED-2:  Devices that create media sessions and exchange\
    \ real-time\n      audio, video, and/or text and that have the capability to\n\
    \      establish sessions to a wide variety of addresses and communicate\n   \

  - "6.  Location and Its Role in an Emergency Call\n   Handling location for emergency\
    \ calling usually involves several\n   steps to process, and multiple entities\
    \ are involved.  In Internet\n   emergency calling, where the endpoint is located\
    \ is determined using\n   a variety of measurement or wire-tracing methods.  Endpoints\
    \ can be\n   configured with their own location by the access network.  In some\n\
    \   circumstances, a proxy server can insert location into the signaling\n   on\
    \ behalf of the endpoint.  The location is mapped to the URI to send\n   the call\
    \ to, and the location is conveyed to the PSAP (and other\n   entities) in the\
    \ signaling.  Likewise, we employ Location\n   Configuration Protocols (LCPs),\
    \ the Location-to-Service Mapping\n   Protocol, and Location Conveyance Protocols\
    \ for these functions.  The\n   Location-to-Service Translation protocol [RFC5222]\

    \       If it finds it, the proxy MUST:\n       *  Insert a Geolocation header\

    \       immediately.  If a location was provided (which should be the\n      \
    \ case), the proxy uses that location to query LoST.  The proxy may\n       have\

    \ is not present and the proxy can query a LIS that has\n       the location of\
    \ the UA, it MUST do so.  If no location is present\n       and the proxy does\
    \ not have access to a LIS that could provide\n       location, the proxy MUST\
    \ supply a default location (see\n       Section 6.11).  The location (in the\

    \ SHOULD NOT be used for routing; the location provided by\n       the UA should\
    \ be used.\n   4.  Either a P-Asserted-Identity [RFC3325] or an Identity header\n\
    \       field [RFC4474], or both, SHOULD be included to identify the\n       sender.\

    \ what happens if either the \"id\"\n       privacy service or a Privacy header\
    \ is present and requests\n       privacy.  In the absence of another spec(T),\

    \ the local regulations governing the PSAP do not specify\n       otherwise.\n\

- title: 13.  Disabling of Features
  contents:
  - "13.  Disabling of Features\n   ED-66/SP-38:  User agents and proxies MUST disable\
    \ features that will\n      interrupt an ongoing emergency call, such as:\n  \
    \ o  Call waiting\n   o  Call transfer\n   o  Three-way call\n   o  Hold\n   o\
    \  Outbound call blocking\n   when an emergency call is established, but see ED-65\
    \ with respect to\n   call waiting.  Also see ED-73 in Section 14.\n   ED-67/SP-39:\
    \  The emergency dial strings SHOULD NOT be permitted in\n      call forward numbers\
    \ or speed dial lists.\n   ED-68/SP-40:  The user agent and proxies MUST disable\
    \ call features\n      that would interfere with the ability of callbacks from\
    \ the PSAP\n      to be completed, such as:\n   o  Do not disturb\n   o  Call\
    \ forward (all kinds)\n   These features SHOULD be disabled for approximately\
    \ 30 minutes\n   following termination of an emergency call.\n   ED-69:  Callbacks\
    \ SHOULD be determined by retaining the domain of the\n      PSAP that answers\
    \ an outgoing emergency call and instantiating a\n      timer that starts when\
    \ the call is terminated.  If a call is\n      received from the same domain and\
    \ within the timer period, and it\n      is sent to the URI in a Contact header\
    \ or the AoR used in the\n      emergency call, then it should be assumed to be\
    \ a callback.  The\n      suggested timer period is 5 minutes.  The mechanism\
    \ described in\n      [RFC4916] can be used by the PSAP to inform the endpoint\
    \ of the\n      PSAP's domain.  Recognizing a callback from the domain of the\
    \ PSAP\n      will not always work, and further standardization will be required\n\
    \      to give the endpoint the ability to recognize a callback.\n"

    \ A-law (and mu-law if they are intended to be used\n      in North America) encoded\
    \ voice as described in [RFC3551] MUST be\n      supported.  If the endpoint cannot\
    \ support G.711, a transcoder\n      MUST be used so that the offer received at\

    \ such as G.722\n      and Adaptive Multi-Rate - WideBand (AMR-WB) in the offer.\
    \  PSAPs\n      SHOULD support narrowband codecs common on endpoints in their\
    \ area\n      to avoid transcoding.\n   ED-73:  Silence suppression (Voice Activity\
    \ Detection methods) MUST\n      NOT be used on emergency calls.  PSAP call takers\

- title: 15.  Testing
  contents:
  - "15.  Testing\n   ED-77:  INVITE requests to a service URN starting with \"test.\"\
    \n      indicate a request for an automated test, for example,\n      \"urn:service:test.sos.fire\"\
    .  As in standard SIP, a 200 (OK)\n      response indicates that the address was\
    \ recognized and a 404 (not\n      found) that it was not.  A 486 (busy here)\
    \ MUST be returned if the\n      test service is busy, and a 404 (not found) MUST\
    \ be returned if\n      the PSAP does not support the test mechanism.\n   ED-78:\
    \  In its response to the test, the PSAP MAY include a text body\n      (text/plain)\
    \ indicating the identity of the PSAP, the requested\n      service, and the location\
    \ reported with the call.  For the latter,\n      the PSAP SHOULD return location-by-value\
    \ even if the original\n      location delivered with the test was location-by-reference.\
    \  If\n      the location-by-reference was supplied and the dereference\n    \
    \  requires credentials, the PSAP SHOULD use credentials supplied by\n      the\
    \ LIS for test purposes.  This alerts the LIS that the\n      dereference is not\
    \ for an actual emergency call, and therefore\n      location-hiding techniques,\
    \ if they are being used, may be\n      employed for this dereference.  Use of\
    \ SIPS for the request would\n      assure that the response containing the location\
    \ is kept private.\n   ED-79:  A PSAP accepting a test call SHOULD accept a media\
    \ loopback\n      [RFC6849] test and SHOULD support the \"rtp-pkt-loopback\" and\n\
    \      \"rtp-media-loopback\" options.  The user agent would specify a\n     \
    \ loopback attribute of \"loopback-source\", the PSAP being the\n      mirror.\
    \  User agents should expect the PSAP to loop back no more\n      than 3 packets\
    \ of each media type accepted (which limits the\n      duration of the test),\
    \ after which the PSAP would normally send\n      BYE.\n   ED-80:  User agents\
    \ SHOULD perform a full call test, including media\n      loopback, after a disconnect\
    \ and subsequent change in IP address\n      not due to a reboot.  After an initial\
    \ test, a full test SHOULD be\n      repeated approximately every 30 days with\
    \ a random interval.\n   ED-81:  User agents MUST NOT place a test call immediately\
    \ after\n      booting.  If the IP address changes after booting, the endpoint\n\
    \      should wait a random amount of time (in perhaps a 30-minute\n      period,\
    \ sufficient for any avalanche-restart event to complete)\n      and then test.\n\
    \   ED-82:  PSAPs MAY refuse repeated requests for test from the same\n      device\
    \ in a short period of time.  Any refusal is signaled with a\n      486 (busy\
    \ here) or 488 (not acceptable here) response.\n"
- title: 16.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "16.  Security Considerations\n   Security considerations for emergency calling\
    \ have been documented in\n   [RFC5069] and [RFC6280].  This document suggests\
    \ that security (TLS\n   or IPsec) be used hop by hop on a SIP call to protect\
    \ location\n   information, identity, etc.  It also suggests that if the attempt\
    \ to\n   create a security association fails the call be retried without the\n\
    \   security.  It's more important to get an emergency call through than\n   to\
    \ protect the data; indeed, in many jurisdictions privacy is\n   explicitly waived\
    \ when making emergency calls.  Placing a call\n   without security may reveal\
    \ user information, including location.\n   The alternative -- failing the call\
    \ if security cannot be established\n   -- is considered unacceptable.\n"
