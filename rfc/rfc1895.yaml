  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This memorandum provides guidelines for using the United States\n\
    \   Department of Defense Military Standard MIL-STD-1840, \"Automated\n   Interchange\
    \ of Technical Information,\" with the Internet electronic\n   mail standards,\
    \ RFC 822 and RFC 1521.  Electronic mail provides a\n   more convenient mechanism\
    \ that delivery via physical media for\n   certain types and quantities of data.\
    \  Software already exists to\n   support data exchanges based on MIL-STD-1840\
    \ and it can continue to\n   be used in conjunction with electronic mail exchanges\
    \ defined in this\n   document.  This document defines a new media type and a\
    \ MIME message\n   structure for exchanging data in conformance with MIL-STD-1840.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The United States Department of Defense (DOD) has defined\
    \ a standard,\n   MIL-STD-1840 [1840], for the exchange of digital data.  Most\n\
    \   applications of that standard use 9-track tape as the transport\n   medium.\
    \  The Application/CALS-1840 media-type is proposed to\n   facilitate such exchanges\
    \ using the Multipurpose Internet Mail\n   Extensions [MIME] and network based\
    \ transport media, i.e. electronic\n   mail [822].\n   This memo has been reviewed\
    \ and authorized by the Continuous\n   Acquistion and Life-cycle Support (CALS)\
    \ Industry Steering Group\n   (ISG).  CALS is a US DOD initiative for the use\
    \ and exchange of\n   digital data.  The Industry Steering Group, which consists\
    \ of members\n   drawn from government and industry, guides the development of\
    \ CALS\n   standards such as [1840].\n"
- title: 2.  Definition
  contents:
  - "2.  Definition\n   An [1840] exchange consists of a set of files with well defined\
    \ file\n   names (see below).  Each set consists of a declaration file and one\n\
    \   or more data files.  The data files, in turn, consist of header\n   records\
    \ immediately followed by the data.  The data itself may be\n   formatted in accordance\
    \ with a published specification or a\n   contractual agreement.\n   MIL-STD-1840\
    \ encodes the file's data type in the file name.\n   It might seem appropriate\
    \ to transform the 1840 headers into MIME\n   headers and use the appropriate\
    \ media type, essentially transforming\n   the 1840 files into MIME body parts.\
    \  There are three reasons for not\n   doing that.  First, not all of the \"types\"\
    \ used in [1840] are\n   registered MIME types.  Second, there exists an installed\
    \ base of\n   software capable of reading the 1840 formatted files and processing\n\
    \   the data appropriately.  Finally the three existing revisions to the\n   standard\
    \ have maintained the same file structure.  Consequently, a\n   processor for\
    \ the data may be able to handle any one of the\n   standard's revisions.  Thus,\
    \ a single Application/CALS-1840 is being\n   proposed and its body part body\
    \ contains headers and data in the\n   [1840] format.\n   A set of related files\
    \ constitutes a \"transfer unit\" in 1840 and each\n   transfer unit shall correspond\
    \ to a Multipart/Mixed MIME entity.\n   Included in each transfer unit is a declaration\
    \ file which shall be\n   the first body part in the Multipart/Mixed entity. \
    \ Several transfer\n   units may be included in a single MIME message.\n"
