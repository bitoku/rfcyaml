  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet has become the primary target for worldwide\n\
    \   communications in terms of recreation, business, and various\n   imaginative\
    \ reasons for information distribution.  A constant fixture\n   in the evolution\
    \ of the Internet has been the support of Best Effort\n   as the default service\
    \ model.  Best Effort, in general terms, implies\n   that the network will attempt\
    \ to forward traffic to the destination\n   as best as it can, with no guarantees\
    \ being made, nor any resources\n   reserved, to support specific measures of\
    \ Quality of Service (QoS).\n   An underlying goal is to be \"fair\" to all the\
    \ traffic in terms of the\n   resources used to forward it to the destination.\n\
    \   In an attempt to go beyond best effort service, [1] presented an\n   overview\
    \ of Integrated Services (int-serv) and its inclusion into the\n   Internet architecture.\
    \  This was followed by [2], which specified the\n   RSVP signaling protocol used\
    \ to convey QoS requirements.  With the\n   addition of [3] and [4], specifying\
    \ controlled load (bandwidth\n   bounds) and guaranteed service (bandwidth & delay\
    \ bounds),\n   respectively, a design existed to achieve specific measures of\
    \ QoS\n   for an end-to-end flow of traffic traversing an IP network.  In this\n\
    \   case, our reference to a flow is one that is granular in definition\n   and\
    \ applies to specific application sessions.\n   From a deployment perspective\
    \ (as of the date of this document),\n   int-serv has been predominantly constrained\
    \ to intra-domain paths, at\n   best resembling isolated \"island\" reservations\
    \ for specific types of\n   traffic (e.g., audio and video) by stub domains. \
    \ [5] and [6] will\n   probably contribute to additional deployment of int-serv\
    \ to Internet\n   Service Providers (ISP) and possibly some inter-domain paths,\
    \ but it\n   seems unlikely that the original vision of end-to-end int-serv\n\
    \   between hosts in source and destination stub domains will become a\n   reality\
    \ in the near future (the mid- to far-term is a subject for\n   others to contemplate).\n\
    \   In 1998, the IETF produced [7], which presented an architecture for\n   Differentiated\
    \ Services (diff-serv).  This effort focused on a more\n   aggregated perspective\
    \ and classification of packets than that of\n   [1].  This is accomplished with\
    \ the recent specification of the\n   diff-serv field in the IP header (in the\
    \ case of IPv4, it replaced\n   the old ToS field).  This new field is used for\
    \ code points\n   established by IANA, or set aside as experimental.  It can be\n\
    \   expected that sets of microflows, a granular identification of a set\n   of\
    \ packets, will correspond to a given code point, thereby achieving\n   an aggregated\
    \ treatment of data.\n   One constant in the introduction of new service models\
    \ has been the\n   designation of Best Effort as the default service model.  If\
    \ traffic\n   is not, or cannot be, associated as diff-serv or int-serv, then\
    \ it is\n   treated as Best Effort and uses what resources are made available\
    \ to\n   it.\n   Beyond the introduction of new services, the continued pace of\n\
    \   additional traffic load experienced by ISPs over the years has\n   continued\
    \ to place a high importance on intra-domain traffic\n   engineering.  The explosion\
    \ of IETF contributions, in the form of\n   drafts and RFCs produced in the area\
    \ of Multi-Protocol Label\n   Switching (MPLS), exemplifies the interest in versatile\
    \ and\n   manageable mechanisms for intra-domain traffic engineering.  One\n \
    \  interesting observation is the work involved in supporting QoS\n   related\
    \ traffic engineering.  Specifically, we refer to MPLS support\n   of differentiated\
    \ services [8], and the ongoing work in the inclusion\n   of fast bandwidth recovery\
    \ of routing failures for MPLS [9].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Emergency Related Data
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Emergency Related Data\n   The evolution of the IP service model architecture\
    \ has traditionally\n   centered on the type of application protocols used over\
    \ a network.\n   By this we mean that the distinction, and possible bounds on\
    \ QoS,\n   usually centers on the type of application (e.g., audio video tools)\n\
    \   that is being referred to.\n   [10] has defined a priority field for SMTP,\
    \ but it is only for\n   mapping with X.400 and is not meant for general usage.\
    \  SIP [11] has\n   an embedded field denoting \"priority\", but it is only targeted\
    \ toward\n   the end-user and is not meant to provide an indication to the\n \
    \  underlying network or end-to-end applications.\n   Given the emergence of IP\
    \ telephony, a natural inclusion of its\n   service is an ability to support existing\
    \ emergency related services.\n   Typically, one associates emergency calls with\
    \ \"911\" telephone\n   service in the U.S., or \"999\" in the U.K. -- both of\
    \ which are\n   attributed to national boundaries and accessible by the general\n\
    \   public.  Outside of this there exist emergency telephone services\n   that\
    \ involve authorized usage, as described in the following\n   subsection.\n"
- title: 1.1.1.  Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS)
  contents:
  - "1.1.1.  Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS)\n   GETS is an\
    \ emergency telecommunications service available in the U.S.\n   and is overseen\
    \ by the National Communications System (NCS) -- an\n   office established by\
    \ the White House under an executive order [27]\n   and now a part of the Department\
    \ of Homeland Security.  Unlike \"911\",\n   it is only accessible by authorized\
    \ individuals.  The majority of\n   these individuals are from various government\
    \ agencies like the\n   Department of Transportation, NASA, the Department of\
    \ Defense, and\n   the Federal Emergency Management Agency (to name a few).  In\n\
    \   addition, a select set of individuals from private industry\n   (telecommunications\
    \ companies, utilities, etc.) that are involved in\n   critical infrastructure\
    \ recovery operations are also provided access\n   to GETS.\n   The purpose of\
    \ GETS is to achieve a high probability that phone\n   service will be available\
    \ to selected authorized personnel in times\n   of emergencies, such as hurricanes,\
    \ earthquakes, and other disasters,\n   that may produce a burden in the form\
    \ of call blocking (i.e.,\n   congestion) on the U.S. Public Switched Telephone\
    \ Network by the\n   general public.\n   GETS is based in part on the ANSI T1.631\
    \ standard, specifying a High\n   Probability of Completion (HPC) for SS7 signaling\
    \ [12][24].\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.2.  International Emergency Preparedness Scheme (IEPS)\n   [25] is a recent\
    \ ITU standard that describes emergency-related\n   communications over the international\
    \ telephone service.  While\n   systems like GETS are national in scope, IEPS\
    \ acts as an extension to\n   local or national authorized emergency call establishment\
    \ and\n   provides a building block for a global service.\n   As in the case of\
    \ GETS, IEPS promotes mechanisms like extended\n   queuing, alternate routing,\
    \ and exemption from restrictive management\n   controls in order to increase\
    \ the probability that international\n   emergency calls will be established.\
    \  The specifics of how this is to\n   be accomplished are to be defined in future\
    \ ITU document(s).\n"
- title: 1.2.  Scope of This Document
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Scope of This Document\n   The scope of this document centers on the near\
    \ and mid-term support\n   of ETS within the context of IP telephony versus Voice\
    \ over IP.  We\n   make a distinction between these two by treating IP telephony\
    \ as a\n   subset of VoIP, where in the former case, we assume that some form\
    \ of\n   application layer signaling is used to explicitly establish and\n   maintain\
    \ voice data traffic.  This explicit signaling capability\n   provides the hooks\
    \ from which VoIP traffic can be bridged to the\n   PSTN.\n   An example of this\
    \ distinction is when the Robust Audio Tool (RAT)\n   [13] begins sending VoIP\
    \ packets to a unicast (or multicast)\n   destination.  RAT does not use explicit\
    \ signaling like SIP to\n   establish an end-to-end call between two users.  It\
    \ simply sends data\n   packets to the target destination.  On the other hand,\
    \ \"SIP phones\"\n   are host devices that use a signaling protocol to establish\
    \ a call\n   before sending data towards the destination.\n   One other aspect\
    \ we should probably assume exists with IP Telephony\n   is an association of\
    \ a target level of QoS per session or flow.  [28]\n   makes an argument that\
    \ there is a maximum packet loss and delay for\n   VoIP traffic, and that both\
    \ are interdependent.  For delays of\n   ~200ms, a corresponding drop rate of\
    \ 5% is deemed acceptable.  When\n   delay is lower, a 15-20% drop rate can be\
    \ experienced and still be\n   considered acceptable.  [29] discusses the same\
    \ topic and makes an\n   argument that packet size plays a significant role in\
    \ what users\n   tolerate as \"intelligible\" VoIP.  The larger the packet, correlating\n\
    \   to a longer sampling rate, the lower the acceptable rate of loss.\n   Note\
    \ that [28, 29] provide only two of several perspectives in\n   examining VoIP.\
    \  A more in-depth discussion on this topic is outside\n   the scope of this document,\
    \ though it should be noted that the choice\n   of codec can significantly alter\
    \ the above results.\n   Regardless of a single and definitive characteristic\
    \ for stressed\n   conditions, it would seem that interactive voice has a lower\n\
    \   threshold of some combinations of loss/delay/jitter than elastic\n   applications\
    \ such as email or web browsers.  This places a higher\n   burden on the problem\
    \ of supporting VoIP over the Internet.  This\n   problem is further compounded\
    \ when toll-quality service is expected\n   because it assumes a default service\
    \ model that is better than best\n   effort.  This, in turn, can increase the\
    \ probability that a form of\n   call-blocking can occur with VoIP or IP telephony\
    \ traffic.\n   Beyond this, part of our motivation in writing this document is\
    \ to\n   provide a framework for ISPs and telephony carriers to understand the\n\
    \   objectives used to support ETS-related IP telephony traffic.  In\n   addition,\
    \ we also wish to provide a reference point for potential\n   customers in order\
    \ to constrain their expectations.  In particular,\n   we wish to avoid any temptation\
    \ of trying to replicate the exact\n   capabilities of existing emergency voice\
    \ service that are currently\n   available in the PSTN to that of IP and the Internet.\
    \  If nothing\n   else, intrinsic differences between the two communications\n\
    \   architectures precludes this from happening.  Note, this does not\n   prevent\
    \ us from borrowing design concepts or objectives from existing\n   systems.\n\
    \   Section 2 presents several primary objectives that articulate what is\n  \
    \ considered important in supporting ETS-related IP telephony traffic.\n   These\
    \ objectives represent a generic set of goals and desired\n   capabilities.  Section\
    \ 3 presents additional value-added objectives,\n   which are viewed as useful,\
    \ but not critical.  Section 4 presents\n   protocols and capabilities that relate\
    \ or can play a role in support\n   of the objectives articulated in Section 2.\
    \  Finally, Section 5\n   presents two scenarios that currently exist or are being\
    \ deployed in\n   the near term over IP networks.  These are not all-inclusive\n\
    \   scenarios, nor are they the only ones that can be articulated ([34]\n   provides\
    \ a more extensive discussion on the topology scenarios\n   related to IP telephony).\
    \  However, these scenarios do show cases\n   where some of the protocols discussed\
    \ in Section 4 apply, and where\n   some do not.\n   Finally, we need to state\
    \ that this document focuses its attention on\n   the IP layer and above.  Specific\
    \ operational procedures pertaining\n   to Network Operation Centers (NOC) or\
    \ Network Information Centers\n   (NIC) are outside the scope of this document.\
    \  This includes the\n   \"bits\" below IP, other specific technologies, and service-level\n\
    \   agreements between ISPs and telephony carriers with regard to\n   dedicated\
    \ links.\n"

  - "2.  Objective\n   The objective of this document is to present a framework that\n\
    \   describes how various protocols and capabilities (or mechanisms) can\n   facilitate\
    \ and support the traffic from ETS users.  In several cases,\n   we provide a\

    \ and a more in-depth understanding.  We also\n   provide some discussion on aspects\
    \ about a given protocol or\n   capability that could be explored and potentially\
    \ advanced to support\n   ETS.  This exploration is not to be confused with specific\
    \ solutions\n   since we do not articulate exactly what must be done (e.g., a\
    \ new\n   header field, or a new code point).\n"
- title: 3.  Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Considerations\n   When producing a solution, or examining existing protocols\
    \ and\n   mechanisms, there are some things that should be considered.  One is\n\
    \   that inter-domain ETS communications should not rely on ubiquitous or\n  \
    \ even widespread support along the path between the end points.\n   Potentially,\
    \ at the network layer there may exist islands of support\n   realized in the\
    \ form of overlay networks.  There may also be cases\n   where solutions may be\
    \ constrained on an end-to-end basis (i.e., at\n   the transport or application\
    \ layer).  It is this diversity and\n   possibly partial support that needs to\
    \ be taken into account by those\n   designing and deploying ETS-related solutions.\n\
    \   Another aspect to consider is that there are existing architectures\n   and\
    \ protocols from other standards bodies that support emergency-\n   related communications.\
    \  The effort in interoperating with these\n   systems, presumably through gateways\
    \ or similar types of nodes with\n   IETF protocols, would foster a need to distinguish\
    \ ETS flows from\n   other flows.  One reason would be the scenario of triggering\
    \ ETS\n   service from an IP network.\n   Finally, we take into consideration\
    \ the requirements of [35, 36] in\n   discussing the protocols and mechanisms\
    \ below in Section 4.  In doing\n   this, we do not make a one-to-one mapping\
    \ of protocol discussion a\n   requirement.  Rather, we make sure the discussion\
    \ of Section 4 does\n   not violate any of the requirements in [35, 36].\n"

- title: 4.1.  Signaling and State Information
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Signaling and State Information\n   Signaling is used to convey various\
    \ information to either\n   intermediate nodes or end nodes.  It can be out-of-band\
    \ of a data\n   flow, and thus in a separate flow of its own, such as SIP messages.\n\
    \   It can be in-band and part of the state information in a datagram\n   containing\
    \ the voice data.  This latter example could be realized in\n   the form of diff-serv\
    \ code points in the IP packet.\n   In the following subsections, we discuss the\
    \ current state of some\n   protocols and their use in providing support for ETS.\
    \  We also\n   discuss potential augmentations to different types of signaling\
    \ and\n   state information to help support the distinction of emergency-\n  \
    \ related communications in general.\n"
- title: 4.1.1.  SIP
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  SIP\n   With respect to application-level signaling for IP telephony,\
    \ we\n   focus our attention on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).\n   Currently,\
    \ SIP has an existing \"priority\" field in the Request-\n   Header-Field that\
    \ distinguishes different types of sessions.  The\n   five values currently defined\
    \ are: \"emergency\", \"urgent\", \"normal\",\n   \"non-urgent\", \"other-priority\"\
    .  These values are meant to convey\n   importance to the end-user and have no\
    \ additional semantics\n   associated with them.\n   [14] is an RFC that defines\
    \ the requirements for a new header field\n   for SIP in reference to resource\
    \ priority.  The requirements are\n   meant to lead to a means of providing an\
    \ additional measure of\n   distinction that can influence the behavior of gateways\
    \ and SIP\n   proxies.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.  Diff-Serv
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  Diff-Serv\n   In accordance with [15], the differentiated services code\
    \ point\n   (DSCP) field is divided into three sets of values.  The first set\
    \ is\n   assigned by IANA.  Within this set, there are currently, three types\n\
    \   of Per Hop Behaviors that have been specified: Default (correlating\n   to\
    \ best effort forwarding), Assured Forwarding, and Expedited\n   Forwarding. \
    \ The second set of DSCP values are set aside for local or\n   experimental use.\
    \  The third set of DSCP values are also set aside\n   for local or experimental\
    \ use, but may later be reassigned to IANA if\n   the first set has been completely\
    \ assigned.\n   One approach discussed on the IEPREP mailing list is the\n   specification\
    \ of a new Per-Hop Behaviour (PHB) for emergency-related\n   flows.  The rationale\
    \ behind this idea is that it would provide a\n   baseline by which specific code\
    \ points may be defined for various\n   emergency-related traffic: authorized\
    \ emergency sessions (e.g., ETS),\n   general public emergency calls (e.g., \"\
    911\"), Multi-Level Precedence\n   and Preemption (MLPP) [19], etc.  However,\
    \ in order to define a new\n   set of code points, a forwarding characteristic\
    \ must also be defined.\n   In other words, one cannot simply identify a set of\
    \ bits without\n   defining their intended meaning (e.g., the drop precedence\
    \ approach\n   of Assured Forwarding).  The one caveat to this statement are the\
    \ set\n   of DSCP bits set aside for experimental purposes.  But as the name\n\
    \   implies, experimental is for internal examination and use and not for\n  \
    \ standardization.\n      Note:\n         It is important to note that at the\
    \ time this document was\n         written, the IETF had been taking a conservative\
    \ approach in\n         specifying new PHBs.  This is because the number of code\
    \ points\n         that can be defined is relatively small and is understandably\n\
    \         considered a scarce resource.  Therefore, the possibility of a\n   \
    \      new PHB being defined for emergency-related traffic is, at\n         best,\
    \ a long term project that may or may not be accepted by\n         the IETF.\n\
    \         In the near term, we would initially suggest using the Assured\n   \
    \      Forwarding (AF) PHB [18] for distinguishing emergency traffic\n       \
    \  from other types of flows.  At a minimum, AF could be used for\n         the\
    \ different SIP call signaling messages.  If the Expedited\n         Forwarding\
    \ (EF) PHB [40] was also supported by the domain, then\n         it would be used\
    \ for IP telephony data packets.  Otherwise,\n         another AF class would\
    \ be used for those data flows.\n"

- title: 4.1.4.  RTP
  contents:
  - "4.1.4.  RTP\n   The Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) provides end-to-end delivery\n\
    \   services for data with real-time characteristics.  The type of data\n   is\
    \ generally in the form of audio or video type applications, and is\n   frequently\
    \ interactive in nature.  RTP is typically run over UDP and\n   has been designed\
    \ with a fixed header that identifies a specific type\n   of payload representing\
    \ a specific form of application media.  The\n   designers of RTP also assumed\
    \ an underlying network providing best\n   effort service.  As such, RTP does\
    \ not provide any mechanism to\n   ensure timely delivery or provide other QoS\
    \ guarantees.  However, the\n   emergence of applications like IP telephony, as\
    \ well as new service\n   models, present new environments where RTP traffic may\
    \ be forwarded\n   over networks that support better than best effort service.\
    \  Hence,\n   the original scope and target environment for RTP has expanded to\n\
    \   include networks providing services other than best effort.\n   In 4.1.2,\
    \ we discussed one means of marking a data packet for\n   emergencies under the\
    \ context of the diff-serv architecture.\n   However, we also pointed out that\
    \ diff-serv markings for specific\n   PHBs are not globally unique, and may be\
    \ arbitrarily removed or even\n   changed by intermediary nodes or domains.  Hence,\
    \ with respect to\n   emergency related data packets, we are still missing an\
    \ in-band\n   marking in a data packet that stays constant on an end-to-end basis.\n\
    \   There are three choices in defining a persistent marking of data\n   packets\
    \ and thus avoiding the transitory marking of diff-serv code\n   points.  One\
    \ can propose a new PHB dedicated for emergency type\n   traffic as discussed\
    \ in 4.1.2.  One can propose a specification of a\n   new shim layer protocol\
    \ at some location above IP.  Or, one can add a\n   new specification to an existing\
    \ application layer protocol.  The\n   first two cases are probably the \"cleanest\"\
    \ architecturally, but they\n   are long term efforts that may not come to pass\
    \ because of a limited\n   number of diff-serv code points and the contention\
    \ that yet another\n   shim layer will make the IP stack too large.  The third\
    \ case, placing\n   a marking in an application layer packet, also has drawbacks;\
    \ the key\n   weakness being the specification of a marking on a per-application\n\
    \   basis.\n   Discussions have been held in the Audio/Visual Transport (AVT)\n\
    \   working group on augmenting RTP so that it can carry a marking that\n   distinguishes\
    \ emergency-related traffic from that which is not.\n   Specifically, these discussions\
    \ centered on defining a new extension\n   that contains a \"classifier\" field\
    \ indicating the condition\n   associated with the packet (e.g., authorized-emergency,\
    \ emergency,\n   normal) [26].  The rationale behind this idea was that focusing\
    \ on\n   RTP would allow one to rely on a point of aggregation that would\n  \
    \ apply to all payloads that it encapsulates.  However, the AVT group\n   has\
    \ expressed a rough consensus that placing an additional classifier\n   state\
    \ in the RTP header to denote the importance of one flow over\n   another is not\
    \ an approach they wish to advance.  Objections ranging\n   from relying on SIP\
    \ to convey the importance of a flow, to the\n   possibility of adversely affecting\
    \ header compression, were\n   expressed.  There was also the general feeling\
    \ that the extension\n   header for RTP that acts as a signal should not be used.\n"

    \   Further, this treatment is to be the default mode of operation or\n   service.\
    \  This is in recognition that existing regulations or laws of\n   certain countries\
    \ governing the establishment of SLAs may not allow\n   preemptive actions (e.g.,\

    \  We recommend a review of [32] by clients and\n   prospective providers of ETS\
    \ service that gives an overview and a set\n   of principles of Internet traffic\
    \ engineering.\n   MPLS is generally the first protocol that comes to mind when\

    \ any\n   configuring of queues for specific customers (neighbors) to support\n\

    \ As a point of reference, existing SLAs established by the NCS\n   for GETS service\
    \ tend to focus on a loosely defined maximum\n   allocation of, for example, 1%\
    \ to 10% of calls allowed to be\n   established through a given LEC using HPC.\

  contents:
  - "4.4.1.  Denial of Service\n   Any network mechanism that enables a higher level\
    \ of priority for a\n   specific set of flows could be abused to enhance the effectiveness\
    \ of\n   denial of service (DoS) attacks.  Priority would magnify the effects\n\
    \   of attack traffic on bandwidth availability in lower-capacity links,\n   and\
    \ increase the likelihood of it reaching its target(s).  An attack\n   could also\
    \ tie up resources such as circuits in a PSTN gateway.\n   Any provider deploying\
    \ a priority mechanism (such as the QoS systems\n   described in Section 4.1)\
    \ must therefore carefully apply the\n   associated access controls and security\
    \ mechanisms.  For example, the\n   priority level for traffic originating from\
    \ an unauthorized part of a\n   network or ingress point should be reset to normal.\
    \  Users must also\n   be authenticated before being allowed to use a priority\
    \ service (see\n   Section 4.4.2).  However, this authentication process should\
    \ be\n   lightweight to minimise opportunities for denial of service attacks\n\
    \   on the authentication service itself, and ideally should include its\n   own\
    \ anti-DoS mechanisms.  Other security mechanisms may impose an\n   overhead that\
    \ should be carefully considered to avoid creating other\n   opportunities for\
    \ DoS attacks.\n   As mentioned in Section 4.3, SLAs for ETS facilities often\
    \ contain\n   maximum limits on the level of ETS traffic that should be prioritised\n\
    \   in a particular network (say 1% of the maximum network capacity).\n   This\
    \ should also be the case in IP networks to again reduce the level\n   of resources\
    \ that a denial of service attack can consume.\n   As of this writing, a typical\
    \ inter-provider IP link uses 1 Gbps\n   Ethernet, OC-48 SONET/SDH, or some similar\
    \ or faster technology.\n   Also, as of this writing, it is not practical to deploy\
    \ per-IP packet\n   cryptographic authentication on such inter-provider links,\
    \ although\n   such authentication might well be needed to provide assurance of\
    \ IP-\n   layer label integrity in the inter-provider scenario.\n   While Moore's\
    \ Law will speed up cryptographic authentication, it is\n   unclear whether that\

  contents:
  - "4.4.2.  User Authorization\n   To prevent theft of service and reduce the opportunities\
    \ for denial\n   of service attacks, it is essential that service providers properly\n\
    \   verify the authorization of a specific traffic flow before providing\n   it\
    \ with ETS facilities.\n   Where an ETS call is carried from PSTN to PSTN via\
    \ one telephony\n   carrier's backbone IP network, very little IP-specific user\n\
    \   authorization support is required.  The user authenticates itself to\n   the\
    \ PSTN as usual -- for example, using a PIN in the US GETS.  The\n   gateway from\
    \ the PSTN connection into the backbone IP network must be\n   able to signal\
    \ that the flow has an ETS label.  Conversely, the\n   gateway back into the PSTN\
    \ must similarly signal the call's label.  A\n   secure link between the gateways\
    \ may be set up using IPSec or SIP\n   security functionality to protect the integrity\
    \ of the signaling\n   information against attackers who have gained access to\
    \ the backbone\n   network, and to prevent such attackers from placing ETS calls\
    \ using\n   the egress PSTN gateway.  If the destination of a call is an IP\n\
    \   device, the signaling should be protected directly between the IP\n   ingress\
    \ gateway and the end device.\n   When ETS priority is being provided to a flow\
    \ within one domain, that\n   network must use the security features of the priority\
    \ mechanism\n   being deployed to ensure that the flow has originated from an\n\
    \   authorized user or process.\n   The access network may authorize ETS traffic\
    \ over a link as part of\n   its user authentication procedures.  These procedures\
    \ may occur at\n   the link, network, or higher layers, but are at the discretion\
    \ of a\n   single domain network.  That network must decide how often it should\n\
    \   update its list of authorized ETS users based on the bounds it is\n   prepared\
    \ to accept on traffic from recently-revoked users.\n   If ETS support moves from\
    \ intra-domain PSTN and IP networks to\n   inter-domain end-to-end IP, verifying\
    \ the authorization of a given\n   flow becomes more complex.  The user's access\
    \ network must verify a\n   user's ETS authorization if network-layer priority\
    \ is to be provided\n   at that point.\n   Administrative domains that agree to\
    \ exchange ETS traffic must have\n   the means to securely signal to each other\
    \ a given flow's ETS status.\n   They may use physical link security combined\
    \ with traffic\n   conditioning measures to limit the amount of ETS traffic that\
    \ may\n   pass between the two domains.  This agreement must require the\n   originating\
    \ network to take responsibility for ensuring that only\n   authorized traffic\
    \ is marked with ETS priority, but the recipient\n   network cannot rely on this\
    \ happening with 100% reliability.  Both\n   domains should perform conditioning\
    \ to prevent the propagation of\n   theft and denial of service attacks.  Note\
    \ that administrative\n   domains that agree to exchange ETS traffic must deploy\
    \ facilities\n   that perform these conditioning and security services at every\
    \ point\n   at which they interconnect with one another.\n   Processes using application-layer\
    \ protocols, such as SIP, should use\n   the security functionality in those protocols\
    \ to verify the\n   authorization of a session before allowing it to use ETS mechanisms.\n"

- title: 4.5.  Alternate Path Routing
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Alternate Path Routing\n   This subject involves the ability to discover\
    \ and use a different\n   path to route IP telephony traffic around congestion\
    \ points, and thus\n   avoid them.  Ideally, the discovery process would be accomplished\
    \ in\n   an expedient manner (possibly even a priori to the need of its\n   existence).\
    \  At this level, we make no assumptions as to how the\n   alternate path is accomplished,\
    \ or even at which layer it is achieved\n   -- e.g., the network versus the application\
    \ layer.  But this kind of\n   capability, at least in a minimal form, would help\
    \ contribute to\n   increasing the probability of ETS call completion by making\
    \ use of\n   noncongested alternate paths.  We use the term \"minimal form\" to\n\
    \   emphasize the fact that care must be taken in how the system provides\n  \
    \ alternate paths so that it does not significantly contribute to the\n   congestion\
    \ that is to be avoided (e.g., via excess control/discovery\n   messages).\n \
    \  Routing protocols at the IP network layer, such as BGP and OSPF,\n   contain\
    \ mechanisms for determining link failure between routing\n   peers.  The discovery\
    \ of this failure automatically causes\n   information to be propagated to other\
    \ routers.  The form of this\n   information, the extent of its propagation, and\
    \ the convergence time\n   in determining new routes is dependent on the routing\
    \ protocol in\n   use.  In the example of OSPF's Equal Cost Multiple Path (ECMP),\
    \ the\n   impact of link failure is minimized because of pre-existing alternate\n\
    \   paths to a destination.\n   At the time this document was written, we can\
    \ identify two additional\n   areas in the IETF that can be helpful in providing\
    \ alternate paths\n   for the specific case of call signaling.  The first is [9],\
    \ which is\n   focused on network layer routing and describes a framework for\n\
    \   enhancements to the LDP specification of MPLS to help achieve fault\n   tolerance.\
    \  This, in itself, does not provide alternate path routing,\n   but rather helps\
    \ minimize loss in intradomain connectivity when MPLS\n   is used within a domain.\n\
    \   The second effort comes from the IP Telephony working group and\n   involves\
    \ Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP).  To date, a framework\n   document [17] has\
    \ been published as an RFC that describes the\n   discovery and exchange of IP\
    \ telephony gateway routing tables between\n   providers.  The TRIP protocol [20]\
    \ specifies application level\n   telephony routing regardless of the signaling\
    \ protocol being used\n   (e.g., SIP or H.323).  TRIP is modeled after BGP-4 and\
    \ advertises\n   reachability and attributes of destinations.  In its current\
    \ form,\n   several attributes have already been defined, such as LocalPreference\n\
    \   and MultiExitDisc.  Additional attributes can be registered with\n   IANA.\n\
    \   Inter-domain routing is not an area that should be considered in\n   terms\
    \ of additional alternate path routing support for ETS.  The\n   Border Gateway\
    \ Protocol is currently strained in meeting its existing\n   requirements, and\
    \ thus adding additional features that would generate\n   an increase in advertised\
    \ routes will not be well received by the\n   IETF.  Refer to [38] for a commentary\
    \ on Inter-Domain routing.\n"
- title: 4.6.  End-to-End Fault Tolerance
  contents:
  - "4.6.  End-to-End Fault Tolerance\n   This topic involves work that has been done\
    \ in trying to compensate\n   for lossy networks providing best effort service.\
    \  In particular, we\n   focus on the use of a) Forward Error Correction (FEC),\
    \ and b)\n   redundant transmissions that can be used to compensate for lost data\n\
    \   packets.  (Note that our aim is fault tolerance, as opposed to an\n   expectation\
    \ of always achieving it.)\n   In the former case, additional FEC data packets\
    \ are constructed from\n   a set of original data packets and inserted into the\
    \ end-to-end\n   stream.  Depending on the algorithm used, these FEC packets can\n\
    \   reconstruct one or more of the original set that were lost by the\n   network.\
    \  An example may be in the form of a 10:3 ratio, in which 10\n   original packets\
    \ are used to generate three additional FEC packets.\n   Thus, if the network\
    \ loses 30% of packets or less, then the FEC\n   scheme will be able to compensate\
    \ for that loss.  The drawback to\n   this approach is that, to compensate for\
    \ the loss, a steady state\n   increase in offered load has been injected into\
    \ the network.  This\n   makes an argument that the act of protection against\
    \ loss has\n   contributed to additional pressures leading to congestion, which\
    \ in\n   turn helps trigger packet loss.  In addition, by using a ratio of\n \
    \  10:3, the source (or some proxy) must \"hold\" all 10 packets in order\n  \
    \ to construct the three FEC packets.  This contributes to the end-to-\n   end\
    \ delay of the packets, as well as minor bursts of load, in\n   addition to changes\
    \ in jitter.\n   The other form of fault tolerance we discuss involves the use\
    \ of\n   redundant transmissions.  By this we mean the case in which an\n   original\
    \ data packet is followed by one or more redundant packets.\n   At first glance,\
    \ this would appear to be even less friendly to the\n   network than that of adding\
    \ FEC packets.  However, the encodings of\n   the redundant packets can be of\
    \ a different type (or even transcoded\n   into a lower quality) that produce\
    \ redundant data packets that are\n   significantly smaller than the original\
    \ packet.\n   Two RFCs [22, 23] have been produced that define RTP payloads for\
    \ FEC\n   and redundant audio data.  An implementation example of a redundant\n\
    \   audio application can be found in [13].  We note that both FEC and\n   redundant\
    \ transmissions can be viewed as rather specific, and to a\n   degree tangential,\
    \ solutions regarding packet loss and emergency\n   communications.  Hence, these\
    \ topics are placed under the category of\n   value-added objectives.\n"

    \ connecting\n   PSTN switches at its edges.  This scenario represents a single\n\
    \   isolated IP administrative domain that has no directly adjacent IP\n   domains\
    \ connected to it.  We show an example of this scenario below\n   in Figure 1.\
    \  In this example, we show two types of telephony\n   carriers.  One is the legacy\
    \ carrier, whose infrastructure retains\n   the classic switching architecture\
    \ attributed to the PSTN.  The other\n   is the next generation carrier, which\
    \ uses a data network (e.g., IP)\n   as its core infrastructure, and Signaling\
    \ Gateways at its edges.\n   These gateways \"speak\" SS7 externally with peering\
    \ carriers, and\n   another protocol (e.g., SIP) internally, which rides on top\
    \ of the IP\n   infrastructure.\n    Legacy            Next Generation       \

    \ is that all the resources f\n   each IP \"island\" falls within a given administrative\
    \ authority.\n   Hence, there is not a problem in retaining PSTN type QoS for\
    \ voice\n   traffic (data and signaling) exiting the IP network.  Thus, the need\n\
    \   for support of mechanisms like diff-serv in the presence of\n   overprovisioning,\
    \ and an expansion of the defined set of Per-Hop\n   Behaviors, is reduced under\
    \ this scenario.\n   Another function that has little or no importance within\
    \ the closed\n   IP environment of Figure 1 is that of IP security.  The fact\
    \ that\n   each administrative domain peers with each other as part of the PSTN,\n\
    \   means that existing security, in the form of Personal Identification\n   Number\
    \ (PIN) authentication (under the context of telephony\n   infrastructure protection),\
    \ is the default scope of security.  We do\n   not claim that the reliance on\
    \ a PIN-based security system is highly\n   secure or even desirable.  But, we\
    \ use this system as a default\n   mechanism in order to avoid placing additional\
    \ requirements on\n   existing authorized emergency telephony systems.\n"

    \   Given multiple IP domains, and the presumption that SLAs relating to\n   ETS\
    \ traffic may exist between them, the need for something like\n   diff-serv grows\
    \ with respect to being able to distinguish the\n   emergency related traffic\
    \ from other types of traffic.  In addition,\n   IP security becomes more important\
    \ between domains in order to ensure\n   that the act of distinguishing ETS-type\
    \ traffic is indeed valid for\n   the given source.\n   We conclude this section\
    \ by mentioning a complementary work in\n   progress in providing ISUP transparency\
    \ across SS7-SIP interworking\n   [33].  The objective of this effort is to access\
    \ services in the SIP\n   network and yet maintain transparency of end-to-end\
    \ PSTN services.\n   Not all services are mapped (as per the design goals of [33]),\
    \ so we\n   anticipate the need for an additional document to specify the mapping\n\
    \   between new SIP labels and existing PSTN code points like NS/EP and\n   MLPP.\n"
