- title: 1.  Background
  contents:
  - "1.  Background\n   The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) as defined in\
    \ [1] is\n   now used as an integral part of the network management framework\
    \ for\n   TCP/IP-based internets.  Together with its companions standards,\n \
    \  which define the Structure of Management Information (SMI) [2,3], and\n   the\
    \ Management Information Base (MIB) [4], the SNMP has received\n   widespread\
    \ deployment in many operational networks running the\n   Internet suite of protocols.\n\
    \   It should not be surprising that many of these sites might acquire\n   OSI\
    \ capabilities and may wish to leverage their investment in SNMP\n   technology\
    \ towards managing those OSI components.  This memo\n   addresses these concerns\
    \ by defining a framework for running the SNMP\n   in an environment which supports\
    \ the OSI connectionless-mode\n   transport service.\n   However, as noted in\
    \ [5], the preferred mapping for SNMP is onto the\n   UDP [6].  This specification\
    \ is intended for use in environments\n   where UDP transport is not available.\
    \  No aspect of this\n   specification should be construed as a suggestion that,\
    \ in a\n   heterogeneous transport environment, a managed agent should support\n\
    \   more than one mapping.\n"
- title: 2.  Mapping onto the CLTS
  contents:
  - "2.  Mapping onto the CLTS\n   Mapping the SNMP onto the CLTS [7,8] is straight-forward.\
    \  The\n   elements of procedure are identical to that of using the UDP.  Note\n\
    \   that the CLTS and the service offered by the UDP both transmit\n   packets\
    \ of information which contain full addressing information.\n   Thus, mapping\
    \ the SNMP onto the CLTS, a \"transport address\" in the\n   context of [1], is\
    \ simply a transport-selector and network address.\n   It should be noted that\
    \ the mapping of SNMP onto a connectionless-\n   mode transport service is wholly\
    \ consistent with SNMP's architectural\n   principles, as described in [1,5].\
    \  However, the CLTS itself can be\n   realized using either a connectionless-mode\
    \ or a connection-oriented\n   network service.  The mapping described in this\
    \ mapping allows for\n   either realization.  (When both network services are\
    \ available, the\n   CLNS should be used as the basis of realization.)\n"
- title: 2.1.  Well-known Addresses
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Well-known Addresses\n   Unlike the Internet suite of protocols, OSI does\
    \ not use well-known\n   ports.  Rather,\n    demultiplexing occurs on the basis\
    \ of \"selectors\", opaque strings of\n   octets which have local significance.\
    \  In order to foster\n   interoperable implementations of the SNMP over the CLTS,\
    \ it is\n   necessary define four selectors for this purpose.\n   When the CLTS\
    \ is used to provide the transport backing for the SNMP,\n   and the CLTS uses\
    \ a connectionless-mode network service, then\n   transport selector used shall\
    \ be \"snmp-l\" which consists of six ASCII\n   characters; and, SNMP traps are,\
    \ by convention, sent to an SNMP\n   manager listening on the transport selector\
    \ \"snmpt-l\" which consists\n   of seven ASCII characters.\n   When the CLTS\
    \ is used to provide the transport backing for the SNMP,\n   and the CLTS uses\
    \ a connection-oriented network service, then\n   transport selector used shall\
    \ be \"snmp-o\" which consists of six ASCII\n   characters; and, SNMP traps are,\
    \ by convention, sent to an SNMP\n   manager listening on the transport selector\
    \ \"snmpt-o\" which consists\n   of seven ASCII characters.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Traps
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Traps\n   When SNMP traps are sent over the CLTS, the agent-addr field\
    \ in the\n   Trap-PDU contains the IP-address \"0.0.0.0\" An SNMP manager may\n\
    \   ascertain the source of the trap based on information provided by the\n  \
    \ transport service (i.e., from the T-UNIT-DATA.INDICATION primitive).\n"
- title: 2.3.  Maximum Message Size
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Maximum Message Size\n   An entity implementing SNMP over OSI must be prepared\
    \ to accept\n   messages whose size is at least 484 octets.  Implementation of\
    \ larger\n   values is encouraged whenever possible.\n"
