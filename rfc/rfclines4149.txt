This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines a method of describing Synthetic Sources for Performance Monitoring (SSPM).
This is useful within the Remote Monitoring (RMON) framework [RFC3577] for performance monitoring in the cases where it is desirable to inject packets into the network for the purpose of monitoring their performance with the other MIBs in that framework.
This memo also includes a MIB module.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
This document defines a MIB module for the purpose of remotely controlling synthetic sources (or 'active' probes) and sinks in order to enhance remote performance monitoring capabilities within IP networks and services.
Much work within the IETF exists related to performance monitoring.
One interesting aspect of this body of work is that it does not explicitly define an 'active' probe capability.
An active probe capability is complimentary to existing capabilities, and this MIB module is developed to fill this void.
The following definitions apply throughout this document: 'Performance monitoring' is the act of monitoring traffic for the purpose of evaluating a statistic of a metric related to the performance of the system.
A performance monitoring system is comprised of a) traffic generators, b) measurement, c) data reduction, and d) reporting.
The traffic generators may be natural sources, synthetic sources, or intrusive sources.
A 'synthetic source' is a device or an embedded software program that generates a data packet (or packets) and injects it (or them) onto the path to a corresponding probe or existing server solely in support of a performance monitoring function.
A synthetic source may talk intrusively to existing application servers.
The design goals for this MIB module are: Complementing the overall performance management architecture being defined within the RMONMIB WG; refer to the RMONMIB framework document [RFC3577].
This MIB module is defined within the context of the APM MIB [RFC3729].
Extensibility: the MIB module should be easily extended to include a greater set of protocols and applications for performance monitoring purposes.
Flexibility: the module should support both round trip and one  way measurements.
the control of the source and sink of traffic is handled by a management application, and communication is recommended via SNMPv3.
This document is organized as follows.
The next section discusses the relationship of this MIB module to others from the RMONMIB and Distributed Management (DISMAN) working groups.
Then the structure of the MIB module is discussed.
Finally, the MIB module definitions are given.
Relationship to Other MIB modules
This MIB module is designed to be used in conjunction with the RMON
MIB Working Group's two other MIB modules for application performance measurement: Application Performance Measurement MIB [RFC3729] and Transport Performance Metrics MIB [RFC4150].
These MIB modules define reporting capabilities for that framework.
The intent of this MIB module is to define a method for injecting packets into the network utilizing probe capabilities defined in the base MIB modules and measured with the reporting MIB modules.
Other reporting MIB modules may be used as well.
Specifically, this MIB module uses the AppLocalIndex as defined in the APM MIB to map measurement configuration information to definition and reporting structures defined in the APM MIB.
Relationship to Other Work Much work has already been done within the IETF that has a direct bearing on the development of active performance probe definitions.
This body of work has been addressed in various working groups over the years.
In this section, we focus on the work of a)
the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group, b)
the DISMAN working group, c)
the RMON working group, d)
the Application MIB (ApplMIB) working group, and e)
the Realtime Traffic Flow Measurement (RTFM) working group.
The IPPM working group has defined in detail a set of performance metrics, sampling techniques, and associated statistics for transport level or connectivity level measurements.
The IPPM framework document [RFC2330] discusses numerous issues concerning sampling techniques, clock accuracy, resolution and skew, wire time versus host time, error analysis, etc.
Many of these are considerations for configuration and implementation issues discussed below.
The IPPM working group has defined several metrics and their associated statistics, including   a connectivity metric [RFC2678],
These (or a subset) could form the basis for a set of active, connectivity level, probe types designed for monitoring the quality of transport services.
A consideration of some of these metrics may form a set of work activities and a set of early deliverables for a group developing an active probe capability.
During the early development of the SSPM MIB, it became apparent that a one way measurement protocol was required in order for the SSPM MIB to control a one way measurement.
This led to the current work with the IPPM WG on the development of the One Way Measurement Protocol (OWDP)
This work includes both the measurement protocol itself, as well as the development of a separate control protocol.
This later control protocol is redundant with the current work on the SSPM MIB.
The SSPM MIB could be used as an alternative to the one  way delay control protocol.
The DISMAN working group has defined a set of 'active' tools for remote management.
The pingMIB and tracerouteMIB define an active probe capability, primarily for the remote determination of path and path connectivity.
There are some performance related metrics collected from the pingMIB, and one could conceivably use these measurements for the evaluation of a limited set of performance statistics.
But there is a fundamental difference between determining connectivity and determining the quality of that connectivity.
However, in the context of performance monitoring, a fault can be viewed as not performing at all.
Therefore, both should be monitored with the same probes to reduce network traffic.
The DNS Lookup MIB also includes some probe like capabilities and performance time measurements for the DNS lookup.
This could be used to suggest details of a related session level, active probe.
The scriptMIB allows a network management application to distribute and manage scripts to remote devices.
Conceivably, these scripts could be designed to run a set of active probe monitors on remote devices.
The RMON working group has developed an extensive, passive monitoring capability defined in RFC 2819 [RFC2819] and RFC 2021
[RFC2021] as well as additional MIB modules.
Initially, the monitors collected statistics at the MAC layer, but the capability has now been extended to higher layer statistics.
Higher layer statistics are identified through the definition of a Protocol Directory [RFC2021].
See the RMONMIB framework document [RFC3577] for an overview of the RMONMIB capabilities.
Within this context, the development of an active traffic source for performance monitoring fits well within the overall performance monitoring architecture being defined within the RMON WG.
The ApplMIB working group defined a series of MIB modules that monitor various aspects of applications, processes, and services.
The System Application MIB [RFC2287] describes a basic set of managed objects for fault, configuration, and performance management of applications from a systems perspective.
More specifically, the managed objects it defines are restricted to information that can be determined from the system itself and that does not require special instrumentation within the applications to make the information available.
The Application MIB [RFC2564] complements the System Application MIB, providing for the management of applications' common attributes, which could not typically be observed without the cooperation of the software being managed.
There are attributes that provide information on application and communication performance.
The WWW MIB [RFC2594] describes a set of objects for managing networked services in the Internet Community, particularly World Wide Web (WWW) services.
Performance attributes are available for the information about each WWW service, each type of request, each type of response, and top accessed documents.
In the development of synthetic application level probes, consideration should be given to the relationship of the application MIB modules to the measurements being performed through a synthetic application level probe.
Similar, cross indexing issues arise within the context of the RMON monitoring and synthetic application level active probes.
The Configuration Management with SNMP (SNMPCONF) working group has created the informational RFC 3512
[RFC3512], which outlines the most effective methods for using the SNMP Framework to accomplish configuration management.
This work includes recommendations for device specific as well as network wide (Policy) configuration.
The group is also chartered to write any MIB modules necessary to facilitate configuration management.
Specifically, they will write a MIB module that describes a network entity's capabilities and capacities, which can be used by management entities making policy decisions at a network level or device specific level.
Currently, the SNMPCONF working group is focused on the SNMP Configuration MIB for policy [RFC4011].
It is conceivable that one would want to monitor the performance of newly configured policies as they are implemented within networks.
This would require correlation of the implemented policy and a related performance monitoring policy that would specify synthetic probe definitions.
For synthetic probes, there would be a need for a configuration of a) a single probe, b)
several probes, c) source and destination probes, and d) intermediate probes.
In addition, it may be necessary to configure any or all of these combinations simultaneously.
It is hoped that the work of SNMPCONF will suffice.
The scripting language defined by the SNMP Configuration
MIB could allow for active monitoring to be activated and configured from a policy management script.
Further, the results of active monitoring could become arguments in further policy decisions.
This notion is reflected in the decision flow outlined in Figure 1 below.
The Realtime Traffic Flow Measurement (RTFM) working group is concerned with issues relating to traffic flow measurements and usage reporting for network traffic and Internet accounting.
Various documents exist that describe requirements [RFC1272], traffic flow measurement architectures [RFC2722], and a traffic flow MIB [RFC2720].
The work in this group is focused on passive measurements of user traffic.
As such, its work is related to the monitoring work within the RMON WG.
Fundamentally, their attention has not been concerned with methods of active traffic generation.
In summary, the development of an active traffic generation capability (primarily for the purpose of performance monitoring) should draw upon various activities, both past and present, within the IETF.
Figure 1 shows the relationship of the various work activities briefly touched upon in this section.
Horizontally, across the top of the figure are overall control functions, which would coordinate the various aspects of the performance monitoring systems.
Vertically at the bottom of the figure are the functions which comprise the minimum performance monitoring capability; i.e., traffic generation, monitoring and measurements, and data reduction.
Traffic generation is addressed in this MIB module.
Monitoring and measurement is addressed in the APM MIB [RFC3729] and TPM MIB [RFC4150] modules.
Data reduction is not yet addressed within the IETF.
But data reduction could include both spatial and temporal aggregations at different levels of reduction.
This is indicated in the figure by the arrow labeled "Various levels and span".
: Coverage for an overall performance monitoring system 6.
This section presents the structure of the MIB module.
The objects are arranged into the following groups: general information source configuration sink configuration 6.1.
This section provides general information about the capabilities of the probe.
Currently, this information is related to the resolution of the probe clock and its source.
The source is configured with a pair of tables.
The first, sspmSourceProfileTable, defines a set of profiles for monitoring.
These profiles are then used by the second table, sspmSourceControlTable, to instantiate a specific measurement.
This MIB module takes an IP centric view of the configuration of the measurement.
Sink Configuration Configures the sink for measurements.
If the test is round trip, then this table is on the same probe as the source configuration.
If the test is one way, then the table is on a different probe.
The sspmSinkInstance is a unique identifier for the entry per probe.
Additional attributes are provided for test type and test source to identify entries in the table uniquely.

current DESCRIPTION "An arbitrary index."
"The AppLocalIndex value that uniquely identifies the measurement per the APM MIB.
In order to create a row in this table, there must be a corresponding row in the sspmCapabilitiesTable.
When attempting to set this object, if no corresponding row exists in the sspmCapabilitiesTable, then the agent should return a 'badValue' error."

"The size of packet to be transmitted in bytes.
The size accounts for all data within the IPv4 or IPv6 payloads, excluding the IP headers, IP header options and link level protocol headers.
"Indicates how the packet is filled. '
random' indicates that the packet contains random data patterns.
This is probe and implementation dependent. '
pattern' indicates that the pattern defined in the sspmSourceProfilePacketFillValue attribute is used to fill the packet. '
url' indicates that the value of sspmSourceProfilePacketFillValue should contain a URL.
The contents of the document at that URL are retrieved when sspmSourceStatus becomes active and utilized in the packet.
If the attempt to access that URL fails, then the row status is set to 'notReady', and the set should fail with 'inconsistentValue'.
"The string value with which to fill the packet.
If sspmSourceProfilePacketFillType is set to 'pattern', then this pattern is repeated until the packet is sspmSourcePacketSize in bytes.
Note that if the length of the octet string specified for this value does not divide evenly into the packet size, then an incomplete last copy of this data may be copied into the packet.
If the value of sspmSourceProfilePacketFillType is set to 'random', then this attribute is unused.
If the value of the sspmSourceProfilePacketFillType is set to 'url', then the URL specified in this attribute is retrieved and used by the probe.

This object is meaningful only when the object sspmSourceDestAddressType is IPv6(2).
The value of this object defaults to zero if not set.
In the event that the test should run over a specific route, the intent is to force the route using the Loose Source Route option in IPv4 [RFC791] and IPv6 [RFC2460].
This object contains a series of IP addresses along the path that would be put into the loose source route option in the IP header.
The IPv4 addresses are to be listed as 32 bit address values, and the IPv6 addresses are to be listed as a string of 128 bit addresses.
The maximum length allowed within the IPv4 source route option is 63 addresses.
To simply account for IPv6 addresses as well, the maximum length of the octet string is 240.
This allows up to 60 IPv4 addresses or up to 15 IPv6 addresses in the string."
In the event that the test should run over a specific route, the intent is to force the route.
This attribute specifies the length of data to be copied from the sspmSourceProfileLooseSrcRteFill into the route data fields of the loose source route options in the IPv4 or IPv6 headers."

This MIB module defines objects that allow packets to be injected into the network for the purpose of measuring some performance characteristics.
As such, the MIB module may contain sensitive network and application data; e.g., user IDs and passwords.
Further, if security is compromised, this MIB module could provide a source for denial of service, and potential other, attacks.
These issues will be addressed within this section.
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
The sspmSourceProfileTable contains objects that configure link  level, IP, and application level data used within test suites.
These objects with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read  create
are: sspmSourcePacketSize configures the overall size of the test packets, sspmSourceProfileTOS sets the TOS field in the IPv4 and IPv6 headers, sspmSourceProfileLooseSrcRteFill and sspmSourceProfileLooseSrcRteLen give a list of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses for the loose source route options in the IP headers, sspmSourceProfileFlowLabel sets the Flow Label in the IPv6 header, sspmSourceProfileTTL sets the TTL field in the packet headers, sspmSourceProfileNoFrag sets the No Fragment bit in the packet headers, sspmSourceProfile8021Tagging sets the Tag field in the 802.1 headers, and sspmSourceProfileUsername and sspmSourceProfilePassword
these hold the ID and passwords specific to an application test profile.
,   The sspmSourceControlTable contains objects that configure IP and application level data used within a given test.
These objects with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read  create are: sspmSourceControlSrc controls the source IP address used on the test packets, sspmSourceControlDestAddr holds the destination address for the specific test packet, sspmSourceControlTimeout, sspmSourceControlSamplingDist, and sspmSourceControlFrequency control the nature and frequency of the test packet injection onto the network, and sspmSourceControlFirstSeqNum and sspmSourceControlLastSeqNum
set the first and last sequence numbers for the specific test.
The sspmSinkTable contains objects that configure the recipient of the test packets.
As such, the objects in this table have no security issues related to them.
Some attributes configure username and password information for some application level protocols as indicated above.
Access to these attributes may provide unauthorized use of resources.
These attributes are: sspmSourceProfileUsername and sspmSourceProfilePassword.
Some attributes configure the size and rate of traffic flows for the purpose of performance measurements.
Access to these attributes may exacerbate the use of this MIB module in denial of service attacks.
It is possible to define a maximum packet rate on the device and to indicate this rate through the sspmSourceFrequency object.
This object reflects the maximum acceptable packet rate that a device supporting this MIB module is willing to generate.
This places a bound on setting the test packet rate through the sspmSourceControlFrequency object.
Other objects that control aspects of the test packets related to packet size and rate are sspmSourceControlTimeOut, sspmSourceControlSamplingDist and sspmSourceControlFrequency.
The objects sspmSourceControlSrc, sspmSourceControlDestAddr, sspmSourceControlLooseSrcRteFill, and sspmSourceControlLooseSrcRteLen control the setting of the source and destination addresses on the packet headers and the routing of the packets.
The device should not allow the setting of source addresses on the test packets other than those that are administratively configured onto the device.
This is controlled by using the syntax InterfaceIndexOrZero for the control of the source address through the sspmSourceControlSrc object.
It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them over the network via SNMP.
Not all versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
