  - "1.  Introduction\n   E.164 Number Mapping (ENUM) [RFC6116] provides an identifier\
    \ mapping\n   mechanism to map E.164 numbers [ITU.E164.2005] to Uniform Resource\n\
    \   Identifiers (URIs) [RFC3986] using the Domain Name System (DNS)\n   [RFC1035].\
    \  One of the primary concepts of ENUM is the definition of\n   \"Enumservices\"\
    , which allows for providing different URIs for\n   different applications of\
    \ said mapping mechanism.\n   This document specifies a revision of the IANA registry\
    \ for\n   Enumservices, which was originally described in [RFC3761].  This\n \
    \  document obsoletes Section 3 of RFC 3761 while RFC 6116 obsoletes RFC\n   3761.\n\
    \   The new registration processes, which are detailed in Section 6, have\n  \
    \ been specifically designed to be decoupled from the existence of the\n   ENUM\
    \ working group.  Compared to RFC 3761, the main changes are as\n   follows:\n\
    \   o  For an Enumservice to be inserted to the IANA registry,\n      \"Specification\
    \ Required\", which implies the use of a Designated\n      Expert, according to\
    \ \"Guidelines for Writing an IANA\n      Considerations Section in RFCs\" [RFC5226],\
    \ are now sufficient.\n   o  The IANA Registration Template has been supplemented\
    \ with elements\n      for \"Enumservice Class\" and \"Enumservice Specification\"\
    .\n   The IETF's ENUM Working Group has encountered an unnecessary amount\n  \
    \ of variation in the format of Enumservice Specifications.  The ENUM\n   Working\
    \ Group's view of what particular information is required\n   and/or recommended\
    \ has also evolved, and capturing these best current\n   practices is helpful\
    \ in both the creation of new Enumservice\n   Specifications, as well as the revision\
    \ or refinement of existing\n   Enumservice Specifications.\n"

    \   For the purpose of this document:\n   o  \"Registration Document\" refers\

- title: 3.  Registration Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  Registration Requirements\n   As specified in the Augmented Backus-Naur Form\
    \ (ABNF, [RFC5234])\n   found in Section 3.4.3 of [RFC6116], an Enumservice is\
    \ made up of\n   Types and Subtypes.  For any given Type, the allowable Subtypes\
    \ (if\n   any) must be defined in the Enumservice Specification.  There is\n \
    \  currently no concept of a registered Subtype outside the scope of a\n   given\
    \ Type.\n   While the combination of each Type and all of its Subtypes\n   constitutes\
    \ the allowed values for the \"Enumservice\" field, it is not\n   sufficient to\
    \ just list their allowed values.  To allow for\n   interoperability, a complete\
    \ Enumservice Specification MUST document\n   the semantics of the Type and Subtype\
    \ values to be registered, and\n   MUST contain all sections listed in Section\
    \ 5 of this document.\n   Furthermore, in order for an Enumservice to be registered,\
    \ the entire\n   Registration Document requires approval by the experts according\
    \ to\n   \"Specification Required\", which implies the use of a Designated\n \
    \  Expert, as set out in \"Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations\n   Section\
    \ in RFCs\" [RFC5226] and Section 7.2 of this document.\n   All Enumservice Specifications\
    \ are expected to conform also to\n   various requirements laid out in the following\
    \ sections.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Functionality Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Functionality Requirements\n   A registered Enumservice must be able to\
    \ function as a selection\n   mechanism for choosing one Naming Authority Pointer\
    \ (NAPTR) [RFC3403]\n   DNS Resource Record (RR) from a set of such RRs.  That\
    \ means the\n   Enumservice Specification MUST define how to use the NAPTR RR\
    \ and the\n   URI(s) the NAPTR RR resolves to.\n   Specifically, a registered\
    \ Enumservice MUST specify the URI Scheme(s)\n   that may be used for the Enumservice,\
    \ and, when needed, other\n   information that will have to be transferred into\
    \ the URI resolution\n   process itself.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Naming Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Naming Requirements\n   The name of an Enumservice MUST be unique in order\
    \ to be useful as a\n   selection criteria:\n   o  The Type MUST be unique.\n\
    \   o  The Subtype (being dependent on the Type) MUST be unique within a\n   \
    \   given Type.\n   Types and Subtypes MUST conform to the ABNF specified in Section\n\
    \   3.4.3 of [RFC6116].\n   The ABNF specified in Section 3.4.3 of [RFC6116] allows\
    \ the \"-\"\n   (dash) character for Types and Subtypes.  To avoid confusion with\n\
    \   possible future prefixes, a \"-\" MUST NOT be used as the first nor as\n \
    \  the second character of a Type nor a Subtype.  Furthermore, a \"-\"\n   MUST\
    \ NOT be used as the last character of a Type nor a Subtype.  In\n   addition,\
    \ Types and Subtypes are case insensitive and SHOULD be\n   specified in lowercase\
    \ letters.\n   Note: The legacy IANA registry of Enumservices contains Type and\n\
    \   Subtype strings with uppercase letters.  Implementors could be\n   tempted\
    \ to refuse handling uppercase Type or Subtype strings, which\n   could negatively\
    \ affect interoperability.\n   To avoid confusion with Enumservice fields using\
    \ a deprecated\n   (obsolete) syntax, Type and Subtype MUST NOT start with the\
    \ string\n   \"e2u\".\n   The Subtype for one Type MAY have the same identifier\
    \ as a Subtype\n   for another Type, but it is not sufficient to simply reference\n\
    \   another Type's Subtype.  The functionality of each Subtype MUST be\n   fully\
    \ specified in the context of the Type being registered.\n   Section 4 contains\
    \ further naming requirements.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Security Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Security Requirements\n   An analysis of security issues is REQUIRED for\
    \ all registered\n   Enumservices.  (This is in accordance with the basic requirements\
    \ for\n   all IETF protocols.)\n   All descriptions of security issues MUST be\
    \ as accurate and extensive\n   as feasible.  In particular, a statement that\
    \ there are \"no security\n   issues associated with this Enumservice\" must not\
    \ be confused with\n   \"the security issues associated with this Enumservice\
    \ have not been\n   assessed\".\n   There is no requirement that an Enumservice\
    \ must be completely free\n   of security risks.  Nevertheless, all known security\
    \ risks MUST be\n   identified in an Enumservice Specification.\n   Some of the\
    \ issues to be looked at in a security analysis of an\n   Enumservice are:\n \
    \  1.  Complex Enumservices may include provisions for directives that\n     \
    \  institute actions on a user's resources.  In many cases provision\n       can\
    \ be made to specify arbitrary actions in an unrestricted\n       fashion which\
    \ may then have devastating results (especially if\n       there is a risk for\
    \ a new ENUM look-up, and because of that an\n       infinite loop in the overall\
    \ resolution process of the E.164\n       number).\n   2.  Complex Enumservices\
    \ may include provisions for directives that\n       institute actions which,\
    \ while not directly harmful, may result\n       in disclosure of information\
    \ that either facilitates a subsequent\n       attack or else violates the users'\
    \ privacy in some way.\n   3.  An Enumservice might be targeted for applications\
    \ that require\n       some sort of security assurance but do not provide the\
    \ necessary\n       security mechanisms themselves.  For example, an Enumservice\n\
    \       could be defined for storage of confidential security services\n     \
    \  information such as alarm systems or message service passcodes,\n       which\
    \ in turn require an external confidentiality service.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Publication Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Publication Requirements\n   Enumservices Specifications MUST be published\
    \ according to the\n   requirements for \"Specification Required\" set out in\
    \ \"Guidelines for\n   Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs\" [RFC5226].\
    \  RFCs\n   fulfill these requirements.  Therefore, it is strongly RECOMMENDED\
    \ to\n   publish Enumservice Specifications as RFCs.\n   In case the Enumservice\
    \ Specification is not published as an RFC,\n   sufficient information that allows\
    \ unique identification of the\n   Enumservice Specification MUST be provided.\n"

- title: 4.1.  General Enumservice Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.1.  General Enumservice Considerations\n   ENUM is an extremely flexible identifier\
    \ mapping mechanism, using\n   E.164 (phone) numbers as input identifiers, and\
    \ returning URIs as\n   output identifiers.  Because of this flexibility, almost\
    \ every use\n   case for ENUM could be implemented in several ways.\n   Section\
    \ 2 of \"Guidelines for Writing an IANA  Considerations Section\n   in RFCs\"\
    \ [RFC5226] provides motivation for why management of a\n   namespace might be\
    \ necessary.  Even though the namespace for\n   Enumservices is rather large (up\
    \ to 32 alphanumeric characters),\n   there are reasons to manage this in accordance\
    \ with Section 2 of\n   [RFC5226].  The following is a list of motivations applying\
    \ to\n   Enumservices:\n   o  Prevent hoarding or wasting of values: Enumservice\
    \ Types are not\n      an opaque identifier to prevent collisions in the namespace,\
    \ but\n      rather identify the use of a certain technology in the context of\n\
    \      ENUM.  Service Types might also be displayed to end users in\n      implementations,\
    \ so meaningful Type strings having a clear\n      relation to the protocols and\
    \ applications used are strongly\n      RECOMMENDED.  Therefore, preventing hoarding,\
    \ wasting, or\n      \"hijacking\" of Enumservice Type strings is important.\n\
    \   o  Sanity check to ensure sensible or necessary requests: This\n      applies\
    \ to Enumservices, since especially various Enumservices for\n      the same purpose\
    \ would reduce the chance of successful\n      interoperability, and unnecessarily\
    \ increase confusion among\n      implementers.\n   o  Delegation of namespace\
    \ portions: Theoretically, the Type and/or\n      Subtype structure of Enumservices\
    \ would allow for delegations of\n      Type values, and self-supporting management\
    \ of Subtype values by a\n      delegate within the Type value.  Such delegates\
    \ could, for\n      example, be other standardization bodies.  However, this would\n\
    \      require clear policies regarding publication and use of such\n      Subtypes.\
    \  Delegation of Enumservice namespace portions is\n      therefore currently\
    \ not supported.\n   o  Interoperability: Since the benefit of an Enumservice\
    \ rises with\n      the number of supporting clients, the registration and use\
    \ of\n      several services for a similar or identical purpose clearly\n    \
    \  reduces interoperability.  Operational circumstances suggest to\n      keep\
    \ the space occupied by all services published in the NAPTR\n      RRSet at any\
    \ owner in the e164.arpa domain bounded.  Registration\n      of nearly identical\
    \ services and subsequent competing or parallel\n      use could easily increase\
    \ the DNS operational complexity.\n   Generally, before commencing work on a new\
    \ Enumservice registration,\n   the following should be considered:\n   o  Is\
    \ there an existing Enumservice that could fulfill the desired\n      functionality\

    \   o  Section 4.2 provides three general categories for Enumservice\n      classification.\
    \  In some cases, there might be several options for\n      designing an Enumservice.\
    \  For example, a mapping service using\n      HTTP could be considered a \"protocol\
    \ Type\" Enumservice (using HTTP\n      as the protocol), while it could also\
    \ be viewed as an \"application\n      Type\" Enumservice, with the application\
    \ providing access to\n      mapping services.  In such a case where several options\
    \ are\n      available, defining use cases before commencing work on the\n   \
    \   Enumservice itself might be useful before making a decision on\n      which\
    \ aspect of the Enumservice is more important.\n"

    \ can be and are used in a\n   lot of different ways.  This section contains a\
    \ classification of\n   Enumservices, and provides guidance for choosing suitable\
    \ Type and\n   Subtype strings for each individual Enumservice Class.\n   The\
    \ Classification of each Enumservice MUST be listed in the\n   Registration Document\
    \ (see Section 5.2).  If the Enumservice cannot\n   be assigned to one of the\
    \ classes outlined below, the Registration\n   Document MUST contain a section\

    \ help the experts in their decision.\n"
- title: 4.2.1.  General Type/Subtype Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  General Type/Subtype Considerations\n   To avoid confusion, the name\
    \ of a URI Scheme MUST NOT be used as a\n   Type string for an Enumservice that\
    \ is not specifically about the\n   respective protocol or URI Scheme.  For example,\
    \ the Type string\n   \"imap\" would be inadequate for use in an Enumservice about\
    \ \"Internet\n   mapping\" services, because it corresponds to an existing URI\
    \ Scheme /\n   protocol for something different.\n   If Subtypes are defined,\
    \ the minimum number SHOULD be two (including\n   the empty Subtype, if defined).\
    \  The choice of just one possible\n   Subtype for a given Type does not add any\
    \ information when selecting\n   an ENUM record, and hence can be left out completely.\
    \  However,\n   potential future expansion of a Type towards several Subtypes\
    \ may\n   justify the use of Subtypes, even in the case that just one is\n   currently\
    \ defined, as noted in Section 9.\n   It is perfectly legal under a certain Type\
    \ to mix the Enumservice\n   without a Subtype (empty Subtype) with Enumservices\
    \ containing a\n   Subtype.  In that case, however, the Enumservice with an empty\n\
    \   Subtype SHOULD be specified to reflect the base service, while the\n   other\
    \ Enumservices SHOULD be specified to reflect variants.\n"

- title: 4.2.3.  Application-Based Enumservice Classes
  contents:
  - "4.2.3.  Application-Based Enumservice Classes\n   Application-based Enumservices\
    \ are used when the kind of service\n   intended is not fully defined by a protocol\
    \ specification.  There are\n   three cases here:\n   o  Common Application Enumservice:\n\
    \      The application reflects a kind of interaction that can be\n      realized\
    \ by different protocols, but where the intent of the\n      publisher is the\
    \ same.  From a user's perspective, there is a\n      common kind of interaction\
    \ -- how that interaction is implemented\n      is not important.  The Enumservice\
    \ Specification MUST describe the\n      interaction and expected behavior in\
    \ enough detail that an\n      implementation can decide if this activity is one\
    \ in which it can\n      engage.  However, it is RECOMMENDED that the Enumservice\
    \ be\n      defined in a way that will allow others to use it at a later date.\n\
    \      An Enumservice that defines a generalized application is preferred\n  \
    \    to one that has narrow use.\n      An example of this flavor of Enumservice\
    \ is email.  Whilst this\n      might appear to be a \"pure\" protocol scheme,\
    \ it is not.  The URI\n      Scheme is 'mailto', and it does not identify the\
    \ protocol used to\n      offer or retrieve emails by the sender or the recipient.\n\
    \      Another example is the Short Messaging Service (SMS), where the\n     \
    \ existence of such an Enumservice indicates that the publishing\n      entity\
    \ is capable of engaging in sending or receiving a message\n      according to\
    \ the SMS specifications.  The underlying protocol used\n      and the URI Scheme\
    \ for the addressable end point can differ, but\n      the \"user visible\" interaction\
    \ of sending and receiving an SMS is\n      similar.\n   o  Subset Enumservice:\n\
    \      The application interaction reflects a subset of the interactions\n   \
    \   possible by use of a protocol.  Use of this Enumservice indicates\n      that\
    \ some options available by use of the protocol will not be\n      accepted or\
    \ are not possible in this case.  Any such Enumservice\n      Specification MUST\
    \ define the options available by use of this\n      NAPTR in enough detail that\
    \ an implementation can decide whether\n      or not it can use this Enumservice.\
    \  Examples of this kind of\n      Enumservice are \"voice:tel\" and \"fax:tel\"\
    .  In both cases, the URI\n      holds a telephone number.  However, the essential\
    \ feature of these\n      Enumservices is that the telephone number is capable\
    \ of receiving\n      a voice call or of receiving a Facsimile transmission,\n\
    \      respectively.  These form subsets of the interactions capable of\n    \
    \  using the telephone number, and so have their own Enumservices.\n      These\
    \ allow an end point to decide if it has the appropriate\n      capability to\
    \ engage in the advertised user service (a voice call\n      or sending a fax)\
    \ rather than just being capable of making a\n      connection to such a destination\
    \ address.  This is especially\n      important where there is no underlying mechanism\
    \ within the\n      protocol to negotiate a different kind of user interaction.\n\
    \   o  Ancillary Application Enumservice\n      Another variant on this is the\
    \ Ancillary Application.  This is one\n      in which further processing (potentially\
    \ using a number of\n      different protocols or methods) is the intended result\
    \ of using\n      this Enumservice.  An example of this kind of application is\
    \ the\n      \"pstn:tel\" Enumservice.  This indicates that the NAPTR holds\n\
    \      number portability data.  It implies that the client should engage\n  \
    \    in number portability processing using the associated URI.  Note\n      that\
    \ this Enumservice usually does not itself define the kind of\n      interaction\
    \ available using the associated URI.  That application\n      is negotiated with\
    \ some other \"out of band\" means (either through\n      prior negotiation, or\
    \ explicitly through the number portability\n      process, or through negotiation\
    \ following the selection of the\n      final destination address).\n"

    \ between [RFC5226] and the guidelines in this\n   section, [RFC5226] remains\
    \ authoritative.\n   The expert evaluates the criteria as set out in [RFC5226],\

    \ with the ENUM specification [RFC6116].\n   o  Verify that the requirements set\

    \ experts should verify whether the\n      proposed Enumservice does actually\
    \ match the use case.  The\n      experts should also determine whether the use\
    \ case could be\n      covered by an existing Enumservice.\n   o  Verify that\
    \ the Enumservice proposed cannot be confused with\n      identical (or similar)\
    \ other Enumservices already registered.\n   o  If the Enumservice is classified\
    \ according to Section 4.2, the\n      experts must verify that the principles\
    \ of the Class in question\n      are followed.\n   o  In case the Enumservice\
    \ is not classified, the experts must verify\n      whether a convincing reason\
    \ for the deviation is provided in the\n      Registration Document.\n   o  Investigate\
    \ whether the proposed Enumservice has any negative side\n      effects on existing\
    \ clients and infrastructure, particularly the\n      DNS.\n   o  If the output\
    \ of processing an Enumservice might be used for input\n      to more ENUM processing\
    \ (especially services returning 'tel'\n      URIs), the experts should verify\

  - "10.1.  Considerations Regarding This Document\n   Since this document does not\
    \ introduce any new technology, protocol,\n   or Enumservice Specification, there\
    \ are no specific security issues\n   to be considered for this document.  However,\
    \ as this is a guide to\n   authors of new Enumservice Specifications, the next\
    \ section should be\n   considered closely by authors and experts.\n"

  contents:
  - "11.1.  Registry Update\n   IANA updated the registry \"Enumservice Registrations\"\
    \ as defined in\n   (this) Section 11, which replaces the old mechanism as defined\
    \ in\n   [RFC3761].\n   It is noted that the process described herein applies\
    \ only to\n   ordinary Enumservice registrations (i.e., the registration process\
    \ of\n   \"X-\" Enumservices is beyond the scope of this document, and as per\n\
    \   [RFC6116] \"P-\" Enumservices will not be registered at all).\n"

- title: 11.3.  Location
  contents:
  - "11.3.  Location\n   Approved Enumservice registrations are published in the IANA\
    \ registry\n   named \"Enumservice Registrations\", which is available at the\n\
    \   following URI:\n   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/enum-services>.\n   This\
    \ registry publishes representations derived from the IANA\n   Registration Template\
    \ as described in Section 11.2 and specified in\n   Section 5.2.\n   Where the\
    \ Enumservice Specification is not an RFC, IANA must hold an\n   escrow copy of\
    \ that Enumservice Specification.  Said escrow copy will\n   act as the master\
    \ reference for that Enumservice registration.\n"
- title: 11.4.  Structure
  contents:
  - "11.4.  Structure\n   IANA maintains the Enumservice Registry sorted in alphabetical\
    \ order.\n   The first sort field is Type, the second is Subtype.\n   [RFC6118]\
    \ updates the existing Enumservices by transforming them into\n   the new XML-chunk-based\
    \ IANA Registration Template (see also\n   Section 8).\n"
- title: 11.5.  Expert Review Procedure
  contents:
  - "11.5.  Expert Review Procedure\n   Whenever a Registration Document is submitted\
    \ via the IANA website,\n   IANA will take care of the \"Expert Review\" process\
    \ according to\n   \"Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in\
    \ RFCs\"\n   [RFC5226].\n   To prevent clashes, IANA will check whether a request\
    \ with identical\n   \"type:subtype\" (or \"type\" without Subtype) was submitted\
    \ for Expert\n   Review earlier and will inform the experts accordingly.  The\
    \ experts\n   are authorized to resolve clashes as they see fit.  The requesters\n\
    \   may need to update their registration request before getting expert\n   approval.\n\
    \   Once the experts have conditionally approved the Enumservice, IANA\n   will\
    \ inform the authors.  This information should also include a\n   reminder that\
    \ (i) the authors are now responsible for publication of\n   the Registration\
    \ Document (see also Section 6.6) and (ii) the\n   Enumservice will be added to\
    \ the IANA registry only after its\n   Enumservice Specification is published\
    \ according to the\n   \"Specification Required\" policy as defined in [RFC5226]\
    \ (see also\n   Section 6.7).\n   Note: After sending the approval note to the\
    \ authors, IANA has no\n   further responsibilities besides keeping internal records\
    \ of approved\n   Registration Documents.  IANA will be involved again at registration\n\
    \   of the Enumservice (see Section 11.6).\n"
- title: 11.6.  Registration Procedure
  contents:
  - "11.6.  Registration Procedure\n   There is a slight difference in process depending\
    \ on whether or not\n   the Enumservice Specification will be published as an\
    \ RFC.  The\n   reason for this difference lies in the current RFC publication\n\
    \   process that includes IANA interaction shortly before publication of\n   an\
    \ RFC.\n"
- title: 11.6.1.  Published as an RFC
  contents:
  - "11.6.1.  Published as an RFC\n   As per the RFC publication process, IANA will\
    \ receive the Enumservice\n   Specification to carry out IANA actions shortly\
    \ before publication of\n   the RFC.  The IANA action will be to register the\
    \ Enumservice, i.e.,\n   add the Enumservice to the IANA \"Enumservice Registrations\"\
    \ registry\n   (see also Section 11.3).\n   IANA must only add Enumservices to\
    \ the Registry, if the experts have\n   (conditionally) approved the corresponding\
    \ Enumservice Specification.\n   IANA should attempt to resolve possible conflicts\
    \ arising from this\n   together with the experts.  In case there are substantial\
    \ changes\n   between the (conditionally) approved and the to be published version,\n\
    \   IANA may reject the request after consulting the experts.\n   IANA must ensure\
    \ that any further substantial changes the Enumservice\n   Specification might\
    \ undergo before final RFC publication are approved\n   by the experts.\n   Note:\
    \ Clearly editorial changes (such as typos) or minor changes in\n   purely editorial\
    \ sections (such as Authors' Addresses,\n   Acknowledgments, References, and alike)\
    \ are not considered\n   substantial.\n"
- title: 11.6.2.  Published as a Non-RFC
  contents:
  - "11.6.2.  Published as a Non-RFC\n   Once the authors have informed IANA about\
    \ the publication, IANA must\n   ensure that the requirements for \"Specification\
    \ Required\" as defined\n   in [RFC5226] are met, the reference to the specification\
    \ is\n   unambiguous, and the content of the Enumservice Specification is\n  \
    \ identical to the Registration Document as approved by the experts.\n   IANA\
    \ will then register the Enumservice, i.e., add the Enumservice to\n   the IANA\
    \ \"Enumservice Registrations\" registry, and make an escrow\n   copy (see also\
    \ Section 11.3).\n   IANA must only add Enumservices to the Registry, if the experts\
    \ have\n   approved the corresponding Enumservice Specification.  IANA should\n\
    \   attempt to resolve possible conflicts arising from this together with\n  \
    \ the experts.  In case there are substantial changes between the\n   approved\
    \ and the published version, IANA may reject the request after\n   consulting\
    \ the experts.\n   Note: Clearly editorial changes (such as typos) or minor changes\
    \ in\n   purely editorial sections (such as Authors' Addresses,\n   Acknowledgments,\
    \ References, and alike) are not considered\n   substantial.\n"
- title: 11.7.  Change Control
  contents:
  - "11.7.  Change Control\n   Change control of any Enumservice registrations is\
    \ done by\n   \"Specification Required\", which implies the use of a Designated\n\
    \   Expert, according to [RFC5226].  Updates of Enumservice\n   Specifications\
    \ MUST comply with the requirements described in this\n   document.  Updates are\
    \ handled the same way as initial Enumservice\n   registrations.\n   Authorized\
    \ Change Controllers are the experts and the IESG.\n   Enumservice registrations\
    \ must not be deleted.  An Enumservice that\n   is believed to be no longer appropriate\
    \ for use can be declared\n   deprecated by publication of a new Enumservice Specification,\n\
    \   changing the Enumservice <usage> element (Intended Usage) to\n   \"DEPRECATED\"\
    ; such Enumservices will be clearly marked in the lists\n   published by IANA.\
    \  As obsoletions are updates, they are also handled\n   the same way as initial\
    \ Enumservice registrations.  Alternatively,\n   Enumservices may be declared\
    \ deprecated by an IESG action.\n"
- title: 11.8.  Restrictions
  contents:
  - "11.8.  Restrictions\n   As stated in Section 3.2, a \"-\" (dash) MUST NOT be\
    \ used as the first\n   nor as the second nor as the last character of a Type\
    \ or a Subtype.\n   Furthermore, Type or Subtype of any Enumservice MUST NOT be\
    \ set to,\n   nor start with, \"E2U\".  Any Enumservice registration requests\
    \ not\n   following these restrictions must be rejected by IANA, and the Expert\n\
    \   Review process should not be initiated.\n   Section 5.2 contains examples\
    \ for Enumservice registrations.\n   Therefore, IANA must not register an Enumservice\
    \ with Type or Subtype\n   set to \"foo\", \"bar\", or \"sbar\", unless the experts\
    \ explicitly confirm\n   an exception.\n"

    \     </people>\n   In the third IANA Registration Template example above, the\
    \ \"voicemsg\"\n   Enumservice is used.  This Enumservice actually has several\
    \ Subtypes,\n   and one of those is shown in the example.  For each Subtype, an\n\
    \   individual Registration Template must be submitted to IANA, so that\n   an\
    \ Enumservice with several Subtypes will have several corresponding\n   IANA Registration\
    \ Templates.  This is to avoid any ambiguity of the\n   relation between <subtype>\
    \ and <urischeme> elements.\n"

  - "Appendix B.  Changes from RFC 3761\n   This section lists the changes applied\
    \ to the Enumservice\n   registration process and the IANA registry definition,\
    \ compared to\n   RFC 3761.\n   o  While RFC 3761 required \"Standards track or\
    \ Experimental\" RFCs for\n      an Enumservice to be registered, this document\
    \ mandates\n      \"Specification Required\", which implies the use of a Designated\n\
    \      Expert.\n   o  This document defines the classification of Enumservices.\
    \  The\n      IANA Registration Template has been complemented to contain a\n\
    \      <class> element (Enumservice Class).\n   o  A new element <registrationdocs>\
    \ (Enumservice Specification) has\n      been added to the IANA Registration Template.\n\
    \   o  The former field \"Any other information that the author deems\n      interesting\"\
    \ of the IANA Registration Template turned into the\n      <additionalinfo> element\
    \ (Further Information).\n   o  The Enumservice \"Name\" field has been removed\
    \ from the IANA\n      Registration Template.\n   o  The Registration Template\
    \ is now a chunk of XML data, reflecting\n      IANA's recent work to convert\
    \ registries to XML.\n"
