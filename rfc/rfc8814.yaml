  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   When Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8402] paths are computed by\
    \ a\n   centralized controller, it is critical that the controller learns the\n\
    \   Maximum SID Depth (MSD) that can be imposed at each node/link on a\n   given\
    \ SR path.  This ensures that the Segment Identifier (SID) stack\n   depth of\
    \ a computed path doesn't exceed the number of SIDs the node\n   is capable of\
    \ imposing.\n   [RFC8664] defines how to signal MSD in the Path Computation Element\n\
    \   Protocol (PCEP).  The OSPF and IS-IS extensions for the signaling of\n   MSD\
    \ are defined in [RFC8476] and [RFC8491], respectively.\n   However, if PCEP is\
    \ not supported/configured on the head-end of an SR\n   tunnel or a Binding-SID\
    \ anchor node, and the controller does not\n   participate in IGP routing, it\
    \ has no way of learning the MSD of\n   nodes and links.  BGP-LS [RFC7752] defines\
    \ a way to expose topology\n   and associated attributes and capabilities of the\
    \ nodes in that\n   topology to a centralized controller.\n   This document defines\
    \ extensions to BGP-LS to advertise one or more\n   types of MSDs at node and/or\
    \ link granularity.  Other types of MSDs\n   are known to be useful.  For example,\
    \ [OSPF-ELC] and [ISIS-ELC]\n   define Entropy Readable Label Depth (ERLD), which\
    \ is used by a head-\n   end to insert an Entropy Label (EL) at a depth that can\
    \ be read by\n   transit nodes.\n   In the future, it is expected that new MSD-Types\
    \ will be defined to\n   signal additional capabilities, e.g., ELs, SIDs that\
    \ can be imposed\n   through recirculation, or SIDs associated with another data\
    \ plane\n   such as IPv6.  MSD advertisements may be useful even if SR itself\
    \ is\n   not enabled.  For example, in a non-SR MPLS network, MSD defines the\n\
    \   maximum label depth.\n"

  - "6.  Manageability Considerations\n   The new protocol extensions introduced in\
    \ this document augment the\n   existing IGP topology information that is distributed\
    \ via [RFC7752].\n   Procedures and protocol extensions defined in this document\
    \ do not\n   affect the BGP protocol operations and management other than as\n\
    \   discussed in Section 6 (Manageability Considerations) of [RFC7752].\n   Specifically,\
    \ the malformed attribute tests for syntactic checks in\n   Section 6.2.2 (Fault\
    \ Management) of [RFC7752] now encompass the new\n   BGP-LS Attribute TLVs defined\
    \ in this document.  The semantic or\n   content checking for the TLVs specified\
    \ in this document and their\n   association with the BGP-LS Network Layer Reachability\
    \ Information\n   (NLRI) types or their BGP-LS Attribute is left to the consumer\
    \ of the\n   BGP-LS information (e.g., an application or a controller) and not\
    \ the\n   BGP protocol.\n   A consumer of the BGP-LS information retrieves this\
    \ information over\n   a BGP-LS session (refer to Sections 1 and 2 of [RFC7752]).\n\
    \   This document only introduces new Attribute TLVs, and any syntactic\n   error\
    \ in them would result in the BGP-LS Attribute being discarded\n   [RFC7752].\
    \  The MSD information introduced in BGP-LS by this\n   specification, may be\
    \ used by BGP-LS consumer applications like an SR\n   PCE to learn the SR SID\
    \ stack handling capabilities of the nodes in\n   the topology.  This can enable\
    \ the SR PCE to perform path\n   computations taking into consideration the size\
    \ of SID stack that the\n   specific head-end node may be able to impose.  Errors\
    \ in the encoding\n   or decoding of the MSD information may result in the unavailability\n\
    \   of such information to the SR PCE, or incorrect information being\n   made\
    \ available to it.  This may result in the head-end node not being\n   able to\
    \ instantiate the desired SR path in its forwarding and provide\n   the SR-based\
    \ optimization functionality.  The handling of such errors\n   by applications\
    \ like SR PCE may be implementation specific and out of\n   scope of this document.\n\
    \   The extensions specified in this document do not specify any new\n   configuration\
    \ or monitoring aspects in BGP or BGP-LS.  The\n   specification of BGP models\
    \ is an ongoing work based on the\n   [BGP-MODEL].\n"

  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The advertisement of an incorrect MSD value may\
    \ have negative\n   consequences.  If the value is smaller than supported, path\n\

    \ than supported, an attempt to instantiate a path that can't be\n   supported\
    \ by the head-end (the node performing the SID imposition)\n   may occur.  The\
    \ presence of this information may also inform an\n   attacker of how to induce\

    \ defined in this document do\n   not affect the BGP security model.  See the\
