  - "Abstract\n   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) allows revocation information\n\
    \   to be conveyed as part of the SignedData, EnvelopedData,\n   AuthenticatedData,\
    \ and AuthEnvelopedData content types.  The\n   preferred format for revocation\
    \ information is the Certificate\n   Revocation List (CRL), but an extension mechanism\
    \ supports other\n   revocation information formats.  This document defines two\
    \ additional\n   revocation information formats for Online Certificate Status\
    \ Protocol\n   (OCSP) responses and Server-Based Certificate Validation Protocol\n\
    \   (SCVP) requests and responses.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The RevocationInfoChoices type defined in [CMS] provides\
    \ a set of\n   revocation status information alternatives, which allows revocation\n\
    \   information to be conveyed as part of the SignedData, EnvelopedData,\n   AuthenticatedData,\
    \ and AuthEnvelopedData content types.  The intent\n   is to provide information\
    \ sufficient to determine whether the\n   certificates and attribute certificates\
    \ carried elsewhere in the CMS-\n   protected content have been revoked.  There\
    \ may be more revocation\n   status information than necessary or there may be\
    \ less revocation\n   status information than necessary.\n   X.509 Certificate\
    \ Revocation Lists (CRLs) [PROFILE] are the primary\n   source of revocation status\
    \ information, but any other revocation\n   information format can be supported.\
    \  This document specifies two\n   other formats: Online Certificate Status Protocol\
    \ (OCSP) responses\n   [OCSP] and Server-Based Certificate Validation Protocol\
    \ (SCVP)\n   requests and responses [SCVP].\n   Section 2 discusses the RevocationInformation\
    \ structure.  Section 3\n   defines a mechanism to carry OCSP responses.  Section\
    \ 4 defines a\n   mechanism to carry SCVP requests and responses.  Appendix A\
    \ provides\n   the normative ASN.1 syntax for the two mechanisms.\n"

- title: 2.  Revocation Information
  contents:
  - "2.  Revocation Information\n   For convenience, the ASN.1 definition of the RevocationInfoChoices\n\
    \   type from [CMS] is repeated here:\n   RevocationInfoChoices ::= SET OF RevocationInfoChoice\n\
    \   RevocationInfoChoice ::= CHOICE {\n     crl        CertificateList,\n    \
    \ other  [1] IMPLICIT OtherRevocationInfoFormat }\n   OtherRevocationInfoFormat\
    \ ::= SEQUENCE {\n     otherRevInfoFormat  OBJECT IDENTIFIER,\n     otherRevInfo\
    \        ANY DEFINED BY otherRevInfoFormat }\n   The other CHOICE MUST be used\
    \ to convey OCSP responses, SCVP\n   requests, and SCVP responses.\n   This document\
    \ defines the id-ri arc under which the revocation\n   information formats are\
    \ defined.  The id-ri object identifier is:\n   id-ri OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {\
    \ iso(1) identified-organization(3)\n     dod(6) internet(1) security(5) mechanisms(5)\
    \ pkix(7) ri(16) }\n   NOTE: Numbers 1 and 3 were assigned to CRL and Delta CRL.\
    \  These two\n   numbers are not used because these formats use the\n   RevocationInfoChoice\
    \ crl CHOICE when included in CMS [CMS].\n"
- title: 3.  OCSP Response
  contents:
  - "3.  OCSP Response\n   To carry an OCSP response, the otherRevInfoFormat is set\
    \ to\n   id-ri-ocsp-response, which has the following ASN.1 definition:\n   id-ri-ocsp-response\
    \ OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ri 2 }\n   In this case, otherRevInfo MUST carry\
    \ the OCSP response using the\n   OCSPResponse type defined in [OCSP].  The responseStatus\
    \ field MUST\n   be successful and the responseBytes field MUST be present.\n"
- title: 4.  SCVP Request and Response
  contents:
  - "4.  SCVP Request and Response\n   Unlike OSCP, SCVP permits unprotected and protected\
    \ responses, where\n   protected responses can be digitally signed or include\
    \ message\n   authentication codes.  While this provides more flexibility, it\n\
    \   complicates implementations when an SCVP response can be validated by\n  \
    \ entities other than the entity that generated the SCVP request.  If a\n   lower\
    \ layer provides authentication and integrity for the client-\n   server interaction\
    \ and the response is not protected, then a third\n   party cannot validate the\
    \ response because there is no way to know\n   that the response was returned\
    \ over a protected connection.  If a\n   message authentication code is used,\
    \ then the third party will be\n   unable to validate the message authentication\
    \ code because it does\n   not possess the necessary private key.  For these reasons,\
    \ SCVP\n   responses sent to a third party MUST be signed by the SCVP server so\n\
    \   that the third party can validate them.\n   SCVP response validation requires\
    \ matching it to the SCVP request.\n   This means that the SCVP request MUST always\
    \ be included with the\n   response.  SCVP permits the client to retain the response,\
    \ and SCVP\n   permits the request to be returned in the response (in the requestReq\n\
    \   field).  The request need not be protected for matching to be\n   performed;\
    \ nonces and certIds can be checked.\n   To carry the SCVP request and response,\
    \ the otherRevInfoFormat is set\n   to id-ri-scvp, which has the following ASN.1\
    \ definition:\n   id-ri-scvp OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ri 4 }\n   In this case,\
    \ the otherRevInfo MUST carry both the SCVP request and\n   response with the\
    \ following structure:\n   SCVPReqRes ::= SEQUENCE {\n     request  [0] EXPLICIT\
    \ ContentInfo OPTIONAL,\n     response     ContentInfo }\n   The SCVPReqRes has\
    \ the following fields:\n   o request contains the SCVP request.  It contains\
    \ the unprotected\n     request, authenticated request, or the signed request.\
    \  The request\n     MUST be present if the response does not include the requestRef\n\
    \     fullRequest field.\n   o response contains the SCVP response.  It MUST contain\
    \ the signed\n     response.  Additionally, the responseStatus MUST be okay.\n\
    \     Unprotected and authenticated responses MUST NOT be included.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of [CMS], [CMS-ASN],\
    \ [OCSP], [SCVP], and\n   [PROFILE-ASN] apply.\n   To locally store unprotected\
    \ or authenticated SCVP responses, a\n   client can encapsulate the unprotected\
    \ or authenticated SCVP response\n   in a SignedData.  It is a matter of local\
    \ policy whether these SCVP\n   responses that are encapsulated and signed by\
    \ the client are\n   considered valid by another entity.\n"
- title: 6.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   This document makes use of object identifiers.  These\
    \ object\n   identifiers are defined in an arc delegated by IANA to the PKIX\n\
    \   Working Group.  When the PKIX Working Group closes, this arc and its\n   registration\
    \ procedures will be transferred to IANA.  No further\n   action by IANA is necessary\
    \ for this document or any anticipated\n   updates.\n"
