  - "Abstract\n   This document describes the application of MPLS multi-segment\n\
    \   pseudowires (MS-PWs) in a dual-technology environment comprising a\n   Passive\
    \ Optical Network (PON) and an MPLS Packet Switched Network\n   (PSN).\n   PON\
    \ technology may be used in mobile backhaul networks to support the\n   end segments\
    \ closest to the aggregation devices.  In these cases,\n   there may be a very\
    \ large number of pseudowire (PW) Terminating\n   Provider Edge (T-PE) nodes.\
    \  The MPLS control plane could be used to\n   provision these end segments, but\
    \ support for the necessary protocols\n   would complicate the management of the\
    \ T-PEs and would significantly\n   increase their expense.  Alternatively, static,\
    \ or management plane,\n   configuration could be used to configure the end segments,\
    \ but the\n   very large number of such segments in a PON places a very heavy\n\
    \   burden on the network manager.\n   This document describes how to set up the\
    \ end segment of an end-to-\n   end MPLS PW over a Gigabit-capable Passive Optical\
    \ Network (G-PON) or\n   10 Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network (XG-PON) using\
    \ the G-PON\n   and XG-PON management protocol, Optical Network Termination\n\
    \   Management and Control Interface (OMCI).  This simplifies and speeds\n   up\
    \ PW provisioning compared with manual configuration.\n   This document also shows\
    \ how an MS-PW may be constructed from an end\n   segment supported over a PON,\
    \ and switched to one or more segments\n   supported over an MPLS PSN.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The use of PWs in Packet Switched Networks (PSNs) is defined\
    \ in\n   [RFC3985].  This architecture is extended in [RFC5659] for multi-\n \
    \  segment pseudowires (MS-PWs) satisfying the requirements in\n   [RFC5254].\
    \  More detail on MS-PWs is provided in [RFC6073].\n   An MS-PW is a useful technology\
    \ for certain applications where there\n   is an aggregation of paths toward a\
    \ common point in the network,\n   e.g., mobile backhaul; the segments can be\
    \ aggregated within tunnels\n   between PW switching points thus improving scalability\
    \ and reducing\n   the number of control plane adjacencies where a control plane\
    \ is\n   used.\n   Segments of an MS-PW in a PSN can be set up using manual provisioning\n\
    \   (static PWs) or using a dynamic control plane such as the Label\n   Distribution\
    \ Protocol (LDP) [RFC5036] [RFC4447].\n   In many scenarios, in access and metro\
    \ networks, a Passive Optical\n   Network (PON) provides longer distance, higher\
    \ bandwidth, and better\n   economy than other technologies such as point-to-point\
    \ Ethernet or\n   Digital Subscriber Line (DSL).  Mobile backhaul with PON is\
    \ already\n   being deployed.\n   Figure A depicts the physical infrastructure\
    \ of an Optical\n   Distribution Network (ODN).\n                        |   \

    \ A: Typical PON System Architecture\n   In a PON, the Optical Network Unit (ONU)\
    \ and Optical Line Termination\n   (OLT) are adjacent nodes connected by an Optical\
    \ Distribution Network\n   (ODN), which consists of optical fibers and optical\
    \ splitters in a\n   tree topology.  The link between each ONU and OLT is simulated\
    \ as a\n   point-to-point link, and there is no path redundancy between them.\n\
    \   The OLT resides in the central office, while ONUs reside in customer\n   premises.\
    \  ONUs are deployed in huge numbers and so they are cost\n   sensitive.  More\
    \ information about ODNs can be found in [G.984.1].\n   In a mobile backhaul network,\
    \ many 2G and 3G base stations still use\n   legacy interfaces such as Time-Division\
    \ Multiplexing (TDM) and ATM.\n   Therefore, these native services must be carried\
    \ across the PON\n   before they can be carried over the PSN using PWs.  This\
    \ document\n   describes how MS-PWs can be constructed with end segments that\n\
    \   operate over the PON and are switched to further segments operated\n   over\
    \ the PSN.  In this case, the base stations are connected by\n   access circuits\
    \ (ACs) to the ONUs, which act as Terminating Provider\n   Edge (T-PE) nodes.\
    \  The OLT is a Switching Provider Edge (S-PE).\n   This model is shown in Figure\
    \ B.\n   Routing protocols and dynamic label distribution protocols such as\n\
    \   LDP would significantly increase the ONUs' cost and complexity as\n   they\
    \ place requirements on both hardware and software.  Besides the\n   coding and\
    \ maintenance of these new protocols, a much more powerful\n   CPU and more memory\
    \ are also necessary for them to run smoothly.\n   As there is no redundant path\
    \ between each ONU and the OLT, routing\n   and path selection are not necessary\
    \ in the PON.  Therefore, static\n   provisioning of PW labels between ONUs and\
    \ the OLT is simple and\n   preferred because it can greatly reduce the cost of\
    \ an ONU that acts\n   as a T-PE.  However, use of a Network Management System\
    \ (NMS) to\n   provision PWs in a PON would require the network manager to configure\n\
    \   each ONU and to configure the OLT once for each PW.  Since there may\n   be\
    \ very many ONUs (and hence very many PWs) in a PON, this requires a\n   large\
    \ amount of operational effort.  Additionally, there is an issue\n   that the\
    \ configuration of each PW at the OLT and ONU might be\n   inconsistent since\
    \ these nodes are configured separately.\n   [G.988] defines the G-PON/XG-PON\
    \ management protocol called the \"ONT\n   Management and Control Interface (OMCI)\"\
    .  OMCI is an implementation\n   requirement for all G-PON/XG-PON systems.  If\
    \ OMCI is used to\n   configure PWs on an ONU, no upgrade to an ONU's hardware\
    \ is required\n   and the extension to the OMCI implementation is negligible.\
    \  This\n   provides a way of reducing the cost and complexity of provisioning\n\
    \   PWs in a G-PON/XG-PON.\n   This document shows how the two technologies (PON\
    \ and PSN) can be\n   combined to provide an end-to-end multi-segment MPLS PW.\
    \  The MPLS\n   PWs are also carried over the PON in MPLS Label Switched Path\
    \ (LSP)\n   tunnels.  There is an MPLS LSP tunnel in each direction between each\n\
    \   ONU and the OLT in a one-to-one relationship with the underlying G-\n   PON/XG-PON\
    \ channel.  The OLT and ONU perform penultimate hop popping\n   (PHP) [RFC3031]\
    \ on this single-hop LSP so no labels are used on the\n   wire for the MPLS LSP\
    \ tunnel.  There is no change to the operation of\n   MPLS PWs, and MPLS packets\
    \ are carried by the G-PON link layer\n   according to ITU-T [G.984.3amd1] or\
    \ XG-PON link layer according to\n   ITU-T [G.987.3].\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology for G-PON/XG-PON
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology for G-PON/XG-PON\n   We defined the following terms derived from\
    \ [G.987]:\n   o  Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network (G-PON).  A variant\
    \ of the\n      Passive Optical Network (PON) access technology supporting\n \
    \     transmission rates in excess of 1 Gbit/s and based on the ITU-T\n      G.984.x\
    \ series of Recommendations [G.984.1], [G.984.4amd2] and\n      [G.984.3amd1].\n\
    \   o  G-PON Encapsulation Method (GEM).  A data frame transport scheme\n    \
    \  used in G-PON systems that is connection oriented and that\n      supports\
    \ fragmentation of the user data frames into variable sized\n      transmission\
    \ fragments.\n   o  GEM port.  An abstraction of the G-PON adaptation layer\n\
    \      representing a logical connection associated with a specific\n      client\
    \ packet flow between the OLT and the ONU.\n   o  10-gigabit-capable Passive Optical\
    \ Network (XG-PON): A PON system\n      supporting nominal transmission rates\
    \ on the order of 10 Gbit/s in\n      at least one direction, and implementing\
    \ the suite of protocols\n      specified in the ITU-T G.987.x series Recommendations.\n\
    \   o  XG-PON encapsulation method (XGEM): A data frame transport scheme\n   \
    \   used in XG PON systems that is connection oriented and that\n      supports\
    \ fragmentation of user data frames into variable-sized\n      transmission fragments.\n\
    \   o  XGEM port: An abstraction in the XG-PON transmission convergence\n    \
    \  (XGTC) service adaptation sublayer representing a logical\n      connection\
    \ associated with a specific client packet flow.\n   o  Optical Distribution Network\
    \ (ODN).  In the PON context, a tree of\n      optical fibers in the access network,\
    \ supplemented with power or\n      wavelength splitters, filters, or other passive\
    \ optical devices.\n   o  Optical Line Termination (OLT).  A device that terminates\
    \ the\n      common (root) endpoint of an ODN; implements a PON protocol, such\n\
    \      as that defined by ITU-T G.984 series; and adapts PON PDUs for\n      uplink\
    \ communications over the provider service interface.  The\n      OLT provides\
    \ management and maintenance functions for the\n      subtended ODN and ONUs.\
    \  In this document, the OLT is a network\n      element with multiple PON ports\
    \ and uplinks that provide switching\n      capability to the PSN.\n   o  Optical\
    \ Network Termination (ONT).  A single subscriber device\n      that terminates\
    \ any one of the distributed (leaf) endpoints of an\n      ODN, implements a PON\
    \ protocol, and adapts PON PDUs to subscriber\n      service interfaces.  An ONT\
    \ is a special case of an ONU.\n   o  Optical Network Unit (ONU).  A generic term\
    \ denoting a device that\n      terminates any one of the distributed (leaf) endpoints\
    \ of an ODN,\n      implements a PON protocol, and adapts PON PDUs to subscriber\n\
    \      service interfaces.  In some contexts, an ONU implies a multiple\n    \
    \  subscriber device.  In this document, an ONU is a Provider Edge\n      (PE)\
    \ node with one or more ACs that map to the service interfaces.\n      The ONU\
    \ acts as a T-PE.\n   o  ONT Management and Control Interface (OMCI).  The management\
    \ and\n      control channel between OLT and ONT in PON.  The OMCI protocol\n\
    \      runs between the OLT Controller and the ONT Controller across a\n     \
    \ GEM connection that is established at ONT initialization.  The\n      OMCI protocol\
    \ is asymmetric: the Controller in the OLT is the\n      master and the one in\
    \ the ONT is the slave.  A single OLT\n      Controller using multiple instances\
    \ of the protocol over separate\n      control channels may control multiple ONTs.\
    \  The OMCI protocol is\n      used to manage the ONT in areas of configuration,\
    \ fault\n      management, performance, and security.\n   o  Passive Optical Network\
    \ (PON).  An OLT connected, using an ODN, to\n      one or more ONUs or ONTs.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Multi-Segment Pseudowire over PON Network Reference Model\n   [RFC5659] provides\
    \ several pseudowire emulation edge-to-edge (PWE3)\n   reference architectures\
    \ for the multi-segment case.  These are\n   general models extended from [RFC3985]\
    \ to enable point-to-point\n   pseudowires through multiple PSN tunnels.\n   A\
    \ G-PON/XG-PON consists of an OLT, an ODN, and multiple ONUs.  The\n   ODN is\
    \ actually a fiber tree that provides physical connections\n   between the OLT\
    \ and the ONUs.  G-PON/XG-PON has its own physical\n   layer and link layer. \
    \ A GEM/XGEM port is a logical point-to-point\n   connection between the OLT and\
    \ each ONU over GPON Transmission\n   Convergence (GTC) layer/XG-PON transmission\
    \ convergence (XGTC) layer.\n   There can be more than one GEM/XGEM port between\
    \ the OLT and an\n   individual ONU.  Each GEM/XGEM port can be assigned different\
    \ Quality\n   of Service (QoS) and bandwidth.\n   Figure B shows how the MS-PW\
    \ architecture is applied to a network\n   comprising a PON and a PSN.  The Terminating\
    \ PE1 (TPE1) is an ONU and\n   the Switching PE1 (SPE1) is an OLT.  One or more\
    \ PWs run between the\n   ONU and the remote end system (TPE2) to provide service\
    \ emulation\n   between Customer Edges (CEs) (CE1 and CE2).\n   In each of the\
    \ PON and PSN, the PW segments are carried in PSN\n   tunnels.  In the PSN, the\
    \ tunnel is established and operated as\n   normal for PWs (see [RFC3985]).  In\
    \ the PON, the tunnel used is a\n   single-hop MPLS LSP tunnel so that the OLT\
    \ and ONU are label edge\n   routers.  The OLT and ONU make use of PHP on the\
    \ MPLS LSP tunnel.\n   Since this is a single-hop LSP (there are no MPLS-capable\
    \ nodes\n   between the OLT and ONU), this means that there is no MPLS\n   encapsulation\
    \ for the MPLS LSP tunnel on the wire (that is, no label\n   or shim header is\
    \ used).  This results in the on-wire encapsulations\n   shown in Figure C.\n\

    \ On-Wire Data Encapsulations for MS-PWs\n   It should be noted that all PW segments\
    \ are of the same technology,\n   which is packet encapsulated.\n   The use of\
    \ the PW label enables multiple PWs to be multiplexed over a\n   single GEM/XGEM\
    \ port within the MPLS LSP tunnel.  This enables the\n   traffic for multiple\
    \ base stations to be kept separate and allows\n   different services and separate\
    \ ACs for a single base station to be\n   supported.  Furthermore, the multiple\
    \ ACs at an ONU can belong to\n   different native services.\n   At the same time,\
    \ each ONU can support more than one GEM/XGEM port\n   (each supporting a single\
    \ MPLS LSP tunnel) connecting it to the OLT.\n   This allows greater bandwidth\
    \ and so more PWs.  It may also be used\n   to provide a simple way to aggregate\
    \ PWs intended to be routed across\n   different PSN tunnels in the core network,\
    \ or even across different\n   core networks.\n   At present, Ethernet over GEM/XGEM\
    \ is the dominant encapsulation in\n   G-PON/XG-PON.  For fast deployment of MPLS\
    \ over G-PON/XG-PON, putting\n   MPLS PWs over Ethernet over GEM/XGEM is an alternative\
    \ way of\n   transporting MPLS PWs over G-PON/XG-PON with existing hardware.\n"

  - "4.  Label Provisioning for Pseudowires over PON\n   For an MS-PW with a segment\
    \ running over a PON, where the OLT acts as\n   an S-PE and the ONU as a T-PE,\
    \ PW provisioning can be performed\n   through static configuration, e.g., from\
    \ an NMS.  However, in this\n   model, each ONU has to be configured as each PW\
    \ is set up.  The huge\n   number of ONUs (and PWs) makes this method quite forbidding.\n\
    \   The labor of provisioning static labels at the ONUs for PWs can be\n   significantly\
    \ reduced by using a management protocol over PON.  This\n   approach keeps the\
    \ ONU simple by not requiring the implementation of\n   a new dynamic control\
    \ protocol.\n   The usual management protocol in a G-PON/XG-PON system used to\
    \ manage\n   and control ONUs is OMCI.  It is used to perform all configuration\
    \ of\n   the G-PON/XG-PON physical layer and data GTC/XGTC layer on ONUs.  Per\n\
    \   [G.984.4amd2] and [G.988], OMCI can also be used to set up PWs and\n   the\
    \ MPLS LSP Tunnels from ONUs to OLT.  When using OMCI to provision\n   PWs in\
    \ a G-PON/XG-PON, the network manager sends configuration\n   information to the\
    \ OLT only.  The OLT will select suitable PW labels\n   and send all PW and MPLS\
    \ LSP tunnel parameters to the ONUs through\n   OMCI.  The AC can be identified\
    \ in the OMCI signaling so that the\n   network manager does not need to configure\
    \ the PWs at each ONU.\n   OMCI supports the configuration of a number of PW types\
    \ including\n   TDM, ATM, and Ethernet.  The protocol can also be used to allow\
    \ the\n   ONU to notify the OLT of the status of the AC.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document describes a variation of a multi-segment\
    \ pseudowire\n   running over an MPLS PSN, in which one (or both) of the MPLS\
    \ PSNs\n   that provides connectivity between a T-PE and its associated S-PE is\n\
    \   replaced by a G-PON/XG-PON PSN.  The security considerations that\n   apply\
    \ to the PW itself [RFC3985] [RFC4385] are unchanged by this\n   change in PSN\
    \ type.  For further considerations of PW security, see\n   the security considerations\
    \ section of the specific PW type being\n   deployed.\n   G-PON/XG-PON [G.987.3]\
    \ [G.984.3amd1] includes security mechanisms\n   that are as good as those provided\
    \ in a well-secured MPLS PSN.  The\n   use of a G-PON/XG-PON PSN in place of an\
    \ MPLS PSN therefore does not\n   increase the security risk of a multi-segment\
    \ pseudowire.\n   Protecting against an attack at the physical or data link layer\
    \ of\n   the PON is out of the scope of this document.\n   The MPLS control plane\
    \ and management plane mechanisms are unchanged\n   by this document.  This document\
    \ introduces OMCI as a provisioning\n   mechanism that runs between the OLT Controller\
    \ and the ONT Controller\n   across a GEM connection that is established at ONT\
    \ initialization.\n   In other words, the protocol runs on an in-fiber control\
    \ channel.\n   That means that injection and modification of OMCI messages would\
    \ be\n   very hard (harder, for example, than injection or modification in an\n\
    \   MPLS Associated Channel Header (ACH) that has been accepted to\n   provide\
    \ adequate security by isolation ([RFC4385] and [RFC5586]).\n"
