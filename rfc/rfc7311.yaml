    link and then choosing, as the installed path between two nodes,\n   the path
    for which the total distance (sum of the metric of each link\n   along the path)
    is minimized.  BGP, designed to provide routing over\n   a large number of independent

  - "1.  Introduction\n   There are many routing protocols that have been designed
    to run\n   within a single administrative domain.  These are known collectively\n
    \  as \"Interior Gateway Protocols\" (IGPs).  Typically, each link is\n   assigned
    a particular \"metric\" value.  The path between two nodes can\n   then be assigned
    a \"distance\", which is the sum of the metrics of all\n   the links that belong
    to that path.  An IGP selects the \"shortest\"\n   (minimal distance) path between
    any two nodes, perhaps subject to the\n   constraint that if the IGP provides
    multiple \"areas\", it may prefer\n   the shortest path within an area to a path
    that traverses more than\n   one area.  Typically, the administration of the network
    has some\n   routing policy that can be approximated by selecting shortest paths\n
    \  in this way.\n   BGP, as distinguished from the IGPs, was designed to run over
    an\n   arbitrarily large number of administrative domains (\"autonomous\n   systems\"
    or \"ASes\") with limited coordination among the various\n   administrations.
    \ BGP does not make its path-selection decisions\n   based on a metric; there
    is no such thing as an \"inter-AS metric\".\n   There are two fundamental reasons
    for this:\n   -  The distance between two nodes in a common administrative domain\n
    \     may change at any time due to events occurring in that domain.\n      These
    changes are not propagated around the Internet unless they\n      actually cause
    the border routers of the domain to select routes\n      with different BGP attributes
    for some set of address prefixes.\n      This accords with a fundamental principle
    of scaling, viz., that\n      changes with only local significance must not have
    global effects.\n      If local changes in distance were always propagated around
    the\n      Internet, this principle would be violated.\n   -  A basic principle
    of inter-domain routing is that the different\n      administrative domains may
    have their own policies, which do not\n      have to be revealed to other domains
    and which certainly do not\n      have to be agreed to by other domains.  Yet,
    the use of an inter-\n      AS metric in the Internet would have exactly these
    effects.\n   There are, however, deployments in which a single administration
    runs\n   a network that has been sub-divided into multiple, contiguous ASes,\n
    \  each running BGP.  There are several reasons why a single\n   administrative
    domain may be broken into several ASes (which, in this\n   case, are not really
    autonomous.)  It may be that the existing IGPs\n   do not scale well in the particular
    environment; it may be that a\n   more generalized topology is desired than could
    be obtained by use of\n   a single IGP domain; it may be that a more finely grained
    routing\n   policy is desired than can be supported by an IGP.  In such\n   deployments,
    it can be useful to allow BGP to make its routing\n   decisions based on the IGP
    metric, so that BGP chooses the shortest\n   path between two nodes, even if the
    nodes are in two different ASes\n   within that same administrative domain.\n
    \  There are, in fact, some implementations that already do something\n   like
    this, using BGP's MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED) attribute to carry a\n   value based on
    IGP metrics.  However, that doesn't really provide\n   IGP-like shortest path
    routing, as the BGP decision process gives\n   priority to other factors, such
    as the AS_PATH length.  Also, the\n   standard procedures for use of the MED do
    not ensure that the IGP\n   metric is properly accumulated so that it covers all
    the links along\n   the path.\n   In this document, we define a new optional,
    non-transitive BGP\n   attribute, called the \"Accumulated IGP Metric Attribute\",
    or \"AIGP\n   attribute\", and specify the procedures for using it.\n   The specified
    procedures prevent the AIGP attribute from \"leaking\n   out\" past an administrative
    domain boundary into the Internet.  We\n   will refer to the set of ASes in a
    common administrative domain as an\n   \"AIGP administrative domain\".\n   The
    specified procedures also ensure that the value in the AIGP\n   attribute has
    been accumulated all along the path from the\n   destination, i.e., that the AIGP
    attribute does not appear when there\n   are \"gaps\" along the path where the
    IGP metric is unknown.\n"

    the TLV Type.  Only type 1, \"AIGP\n      TLV\", is defined in this document.
    \ Use of other TLV types is\n      outside the scope of this document.\n   -  Length:
    Two octets encoding the length in octets of the TLV,\n      including the Type
    and Length fields.  The length is encoded as an\n      unsigned binary integer.
    \ (Note that the minimum length is 3,\n      indicating that no Value field is
    present.)\n   -  Value: A field containing zero or more octets.\n   This document
    defines only a single such TLV, the \"AIGP TLV\".  The\n   AIGP TLV is encoded
    as follows:\n   -  Type: 1\n   -  Length: 11\n   -  Value: Accumulated IGP Metric.\n
    \     The value field of the AIGP TLV is always 8 octets long, and its\n      value
    is interpreted as an unsigned 64-bit integer.  IGP metrics\n      are frequently
    expressed as 4-octet values.  By using an 8-octet\n      field, we ensure that
    the AIGP attribute can be used to hold the\n      sum of an arbitrary number of
    4-octet values.\n   When an AIGP attribute is created, it SHOULD contain no more
    than one\n   AIGP TLV.  However, if it contains more than one AIGP TLV, only the\n
    \  first one is used as described in Sections 3.4 and 4.  In the\n   remainder
    of this document, we will use the term \"value of the AIGP\n   TLV\" to mean the
    value of the first AIGP TLV in the AIGP attribute.\n   Any other AIGP TLVs in
    the AIGP attribute MUST be passed along\n   unchanged if the AIGP attribute is
    passed along.\n"

      the use of the AIGP attribute in\n   networks where each router uses tunneling
      of some sort to deliver a\n   packet to its BGP next hop.  Use of the AIGP attribute
      in other\n   scenarios is outside the scope of this document.\n   If a Route
      Reflector supports the AIGP attribute but some of its\n   clients do not, then

      policy.\n"

    - "3.2.  Handling a Malformed AIGP Attribute\n   When receiving a BGP Update message
      containing a malformed AIGP\n   attribute, the attribute MUST be treated exactly
      as if it were an\n   unrecognized non-transitive attribute.  That is, it \"MUST
      be quietly\n   ignored and not passed along to other BGP peers\" (see [BGP],
      Section\n   5).  This is equivalent to the \"attribute discard\" action specified\n
      \  in [BGP-ERROR].\n   Note that an AIGP attribute MUST NOT be considered to
      be malformed\n   because it contains more than one TLV of a given type or because
      it\n   contains TLVs of unknown types.\n   If a BGP path attribute is received
      that has the AIGP attribute\n   codepoint but also has the transitive bit set,
      the attribute MUST be\n   considered to be a malformed AIGP attribute and MUST
      be discarded as\n   specified in this section.\n   If an AIGP attribute is received
      and its first AIGP TLV contains the\n   maximum value 0xffffffffffffffff, the
      attribute SHOULD be considered\n   to be malformed and SHOULD be discarded as
      specified in this section.\n   (Since the TLV value cannot be increased any
      further, it is not\n   useful for metric-based path selection.)\n"

      session.\n   -  For Internal BGP (IBGP) sessions, and for External BGP (EBGP)\n

      MUST be \"disabled\".\n   The AIGP attribute MUST NOT be sent on any BGP session
      for which\n   AIGP_SESSION is disabled.\n   If an AIGP attribute is received
      on a BGP session for which\n   AIGP_SESSION is disabled, the attribute MUST

      \ That is, it \"MUST\n   be quietly ignored and not passed along to other BGP
      peers\" (see\n   [BGP], Section 5).  However, the fact that the attribute was
      received\n   SHOULD be logged (in a rate-limited manner).\n"

      - "3.4.1.  Originating the AIGP Attribute\n   An implementation that supports
        the AIGP attribute MUST support a\n   configuration item, AIGP_ORIGINATE,
        that enables or disables its\n   creation and attachment to routes.  The default
        value of\n   AIGP_ORIGINATE MUST be \"disabled\".\n   A BGP speaker MUST NOT
        add the AIGP attribute to any route whose path\n   leads outside the AIGP
        administrative domain to which the BGP speaker\n   belongs.  When the AIGP
        attribute is used, changes in IGP routing\n   will directly impact BGP routing.
        \ Attaching the AIGP attribute to\n   customer routes, Internet routes, or
        other routes whose paths lead\n   outside the infrastructure of a particular
        AIGP administrative domain\n   could result in BGP scaling and/or thrashing
        problems.\n   The AIGP attribute may be added only to routes that satisfy
        one of\n   the following conditions:\n   -  The route is a static route, not
        leading outside the AIGP\n      administrative domain, that is being redistributed
        into BGP;\n   -  The route is an IGP route that is being redistributed into
        BGP;\n   -  The route is an IBGP-learned route whose AS_PATH attribute is\n
        \     empty; or\n   -  The route is an EBGP-learned route whose AS_PATH contains
        only\n      ASes that are in the same AIGP administrative domain as the BGP\n
        \     speaker.\n   A BGP speaker R MUST NOT add the AIGP attribute to any
        route for\n   which R does not set itself as the next hop.\n   It SHOULD be
        possible to set AIGP_ORIGINATE to \"enabled for the\n   routes of a particular
        IGP that are redistributed into BGP\" (where \"a\n   particular IGP\" might
        be OSPF or IS-IS).  Other policies determining\n   when and whether to originate
        an AIGP attribute are also possible,\n   depending on the needs of a particular
        deployment scenario.\n   When originating an AIGP attribute for a BGP route
        to address prefix\n   P, the value of the AIGP TLV is set according to policy.
        \ There are a\n   number of useful policies, some of which are in the following
        list:\n   -  When a BGP speaker R is redistributing into BGP an IGP route
        to\n      address prefix P, the IGP will have computed a distance from R to\n
        \     P.  This distance MAY be assigned as the value of the AIGP TLV.\n   -
        \ A BGP speaker R may be redistributing into BGP a static route to\n      address
        prefix P, for which a distance from R to P has been\n      configured.  This
        distance MAY be assigned as the value of the\n      AIGP TLV.\n   -  A BGP
        speaker R may have received and installed a BGP-learned\n      route to prefix
        P, with next hop N.  Or it may be redistributing a\n      static route to
        P, with next hop N.  Then:\n      *  If R has an IGP route to N, the IGP-computed
        distance from R to\n         N MAY be used as the value of the AIGP TLV of
        the route to P.\n      *  If R has a BGP route to N, and an AIGP TLV attribute
        value has\n         been computed for that route (see Section 3.4.3), that
        value\n         MAY be used as the AIGP TLV value of the route to P.\n"

        at some point, R SHOULD issue a\n   new BGP update containing the new value
        of the AIGP TLV of the AIGP\n   attribute.  (Here we use the term \"distance\"
        to refer to whatever\n   value the originator assigns to the AIGP TLV, however
        it is computed;\n   see Section 3.4.1.) However, if the difference between

        a route with an AIGP attribute\n   whose value is A and with a next hop whose
        value is R2.  Suppose also\n   that R1 is about to redistribute that route
        on a BGP session that is\n   enabled for sending/receiving the attribute.\n
        \  If R1 does not change the next hop of the route, then R1 MUST NOT\n   change
        the AIGP attribute value of the route.\n   In all the computations discussed
        in this section, the AIGP value\n   MUST be capped at its maximum unsigned
        value 0xffffffffffffffff.\n   Increasing the AIGP value MUST NOT cause the
        value to wrap around.\n   Suppose R1 changes the next hop of the route from
        R2 to R1.  If R1's\n   route to R2 is either (a) an IGP-learned route or (b)
        a static route\n   that does not require recursive next hop resolution, then
        R1 MUST\n   increase the value of the AIGP TLV by adding to A the distance
        from\n   R1 to R2.  This distance is either the IGP-computed distance from
        R1\n   to R2 or some value determined by policy.  However, A MUST be\n   increased
        by a non-zero amount.\n   It is possible that R1 and R2 above are EBGP neighbors
        and that there\n   is a direct link between them on which no IGP is running.
        \ Then, when\n   R1 changes the next hop of a route from R2 to R1, the AIGP
        TLV value\n   MUST be increased by a non-zero amount.  The amount of the increase\n
        \  SHOULD be such that it is properly comparable to the IGP metrics.\n   For
        example, if the IGP metric is a function of latency, then the\n   amount of
        the increase should be a function of the latency from R1 to\n   R2.\n   Suppose
        R1 changes the next hop of the route from R2 to R1 and R1's\n   route to R2
        is either (a) a BGP-learned route or (b) a static route\n   that requires
        recursive next-hop resolution.  Then, the AIGP TLV\n   value needs to be increased
        in several steps, according to the\n   following procedure.  (Note that this
        procedure is ONLY used when\n   recursive next-hop resolution is needed.)\n
        \  1.  Let Xattr be the new AIGP TLV value.\n   2.  Initialize Xattr to A.\n
        \  3.  Set XNH to R2.\n   4.  Find the route to XNH.\n   5.  If the route
        to XNH does not require recursive next-hop\n       resolution, get the distance
        D from R1 to XNH.  (Note that this\n       condition cannot be satisfied the
        first time through this\n       procedure.)  If D is above a configurable
        threshold, set the AIGP\n       TLV value to Xattr+D.  If D is below a configurable
        threshold,\n       set the AIGP TLV value to Xattr.  In either case, exit
        this\n       procedure.\n   6.  If the route to XNH is a BGP-learned route
        that does NOT have an\n       AIGP attribute, then exit this procedure and
        do not pass on any\n       AIGP attribute.  If the route has an AIGP attribute
        without an\n       AIGP TLV, then the AIGP attribute MAY be passed along unchanged.\n
        \  7.  If the route to XNH is a BGP-learned route that has an AIGP TLV\n       value
        of Y, then set Xattr to Xattr+Y and set XNH to the next hop\n       of this
        route.  (The intention here is that Y is the AIGP TLV\n       value of the
        route as it was received by R1, without having been\n       modified by R1.)\n
        \  8.  Go to step 4.\n   The AIGP TLV value of a given route depends on (a)
        the AIGP TLV\n   values of all the next hops that are recursively resolved
        during this\n   procedure, and (b) the IGP distance to any next hop that is
        not\n   recursively resolved.  Any change due to (a) in any of these values\n
        \  MUST trigger a new AIGP computation for that route.  Whether a change\n
        \  due to (b) triggers a new AIGP computation depends upon whether the\n   change
        in IGP distance exceeds a configurable threshold.\n   If the AIGP attribute
        is carried across several ASes, each with its\n   own IGP domain, it is clear
        that these procedures are unlikely to\n   give a sensible result if the IGPs
        are different (e.g., some OSPF and\n   some IS-IS) or if the meaning of the
        metrics is different in the\n   different IGPs (e.g., if the metric represents
        bandwidth in some IGP\n   domains but represents latency in others).  These
        procedures also are\n   unlikely to give a sensible result if the metric assigned
        to inter-AS\n   BGP links (on which no IGP is running) or to static routes
        is not\n   comparable to the IGP metrics.  All such cases are outside the
        scope\n   of the current document.\n"

  - "4.  Decision Process\n   Support for the AIGP attribute involves several modifications
    to the\n   tie-breaking procedures of the BGP \"phase 2\" decision described in\n
    \  [BGP], Section 9.1.2.2.  These modifications are described in\n   Sections
    4.1 and 4.2.\n   In some cases, the BGP decision process may install a route without\n
    \  executing any tie-breaking procedures.  This may happen, e.g., if\n   only
    one route to a given prefix has the highest degree of preference\n   (as defined
    in [BGP], Section 9.1.1).  In this case, the AIGP\n   attribute is not considered.\n
    \  In other cases, some routes may be eliminated before the tie-breaking\n   procedures
    are invoked, e.g., routes with AS-PATH attributes\n   indicating a loop or routes
    with unresolvable next hops.  In these\n   cases, the AIGP attributes of the eliminated
    routes are not\n   considered.\n"

    - "4.2.  When the Route to the Next Hop Has an AIGP Attribute\n   Suppose that
      a given router R1 is comparing two BGP-learned routes,\n   such that either:\n
      \  -  the two routes have equal AIGP TLV values, or else\n   -  neither of the
      two routes has an AIGP attribute containing an AIGP\n      TLV.\n   The BGP
      decision process as specified in [BGP] makes use, in its tie-\n   breaking procedures,
      of \"interior cost\", defined as follows:\n      interior cost of a route is
      determined by calculating the metric\n      to the NEXT_HOP for the route using
      the Routing Table.\n   This document replaces the \"interior cost\" tie breaker
      of [BGP] with\n   a tie breaker based on the \"AIGP-enhanced interior cost\".
      \ Suppose\n   route T has a next hop of N.  The \"AIGP-enhanced interior cost\"
      from\n   node R1 to node N is defined as follows:\n   -  Let R2 be the BGP next
      hop of the route to N after all recursive\n      resolution of the next hop
      is done.  Let m be the IGP distance (or\n      in the case of a static route,
      the configured distance) from R1 to\n      R2.\n   -  If the installed route
      to N has an AIGP attribute with an AIGP\n      TLV, set A to its AIGP TLV value,
      computed according to the\n      procedure in Section 3.4.3.\n   -  If the installed
      route to N does not have an AIGP attribute with\n      an AIGP TLV, set A to
      0.\n   -  The \"AIGP-enhanced interior cost\" of route T is the quantity A+m.\n
      \  The \"interior cost\" tie breaker of [BGP] is then applied, using the\n   \"AIGP-enhanced
      interior cost\" instead of the \"interior cost\" as\n   defined in [BGP].\n"

  - "5.  Deployment Considerations\n   -  Using the AIGP attribute to achieve a desired
    routing policy will\n      be more effective if each BGP speaker can use it to
    choose from\n      among multiple routes.  Thus, it is highly recommended that
    the\n      procedures of [BESTEXT] and [ADD-PATH] be used in conjunction with\n
    \     the AIGP attribute.\n   -  If a Route Reflector does not pass all paths
    to its clients, then\n      it will tend to pass the paths for which the IGP distance
    from the\n      Route Reflector itself to the next hop is smallest.  This may\n
    \     result in a non-optimal choice by the clients.\n   -  When the procedures
    of this document are deployed, it must be\n      understood that frequent changes
    of the IGP distance towards a\n      certain prefix may result in equally frequent
    transmission of BGP\n      updates about that prefix.\n   -  In an IGP deployment,
    there are certain situations in which a\n      network link may be temporarily
    assigned a metric whose value is\n      the maximum metric value (or close to
    the maximum) for that IGP.\n      This is known as \"costing out\" the link.  A
    link may be \"costed\n      out\" to deflect traffic from the link before the
    link is actually\n      brought down or to discourage traffic from using a link
    until all\n      the necessary state for that link has been set up (e.g.,\n      [LDP-IGP-SYNC]).
    \ This assumes, of course, that a path containing\n      a \"costed out\" link
    will have a total distance that is larger than\n      any alternate path within
    the same IGP area; in that case, the\n      normal IGP decision process will choose
    the path that does not\n      contain the \"costed out\" link.\n      Costing
    out a link will have the same effect on BGP routes that\n      carry the AIGP
    attribute.  The value of the AIGP TLV will be\n      larger for a route (to a
    given prefix) that contains a \"costed\n      out\" link than for a route (to
    the same prefix) that does not.  It\n      must be understood, though, that a
    route that carries an AIGP\n      attribute will be preferred to a route that
    does not, no matter\n      what the value of the AIGP TLV is.  This is similar
    to the\n      behavior in, e.g., an OSPF area, where an intra-area route is\n
    \     preferred to an inter-area or external route, even if the intra-\n      area
    route's distance is large.\n"

  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has assigned the codepoint 26 in the \"BGP Path
    Attributes\"\n   registry to the AIGP attribute.\n   IANA has created a registry
    for \"BGP AIGP Attribute Types\".  The Type\n   field consists of a single octet,
    with possible values from 1 to 255.\n   (The value 0 is \"Reserved\".)  The registration
    procedure for this\n   registry is \"Standards Action\".  Type 1 is defined as

    \  result in an AIGP attribute being passed from one service provider to\n   another.
    \ This would likely result in an unsound selection of paths.\n"
