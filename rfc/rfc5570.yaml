  - "1.  Introduction\n   The original IPv4 specification in RFC 791 includes an option\
    \ for\n   labeling the sensitivity of IP packets.  That option was revised by\n\
    \   RFC 1038 and later by RFC 1108 [RFC791] [RFC1038] [RFC1108].\n   Although\
    \ the IETF later deprecated RFC 1108, that IPv4 option\n   continues to be in\
    \ active use within a number of closed Multi-Level\n   Secure (MLS) IP networks.\n\
    \   One or another IP Sensitivity Label option has been in limited\n   deployment\
    \ for about two decades, most usually in governmental or\n   military internal\
    \ networks.  There are also some commercial sector\n   deployments, where corporate\
    \ security policies require Mandatory\n   Access Controls be applied to sensitive\
    \ data.  Some banks use MLS\n   technology to restrict sensitive information,\
    \ for example information\n   about mergers and acquisitions.  This IPv6 option,\
    \ like its IPv4\n   predecessors, is only intended for deployment within private\n\
    \   internetworks, disconnected from the global Internet.  This document\n   specifies\
    \ the explicit packet labeling extensions for IPv6 packets.\n"
- title: 1.1.  History
  contents:
  - "1.1.  History\n   This document is a direct descendent of RFC 1038 and RFC 1108\
    \ and is\n   a close cousin to the work done in the Commercial IP Security Option\n\
    \   (CIPSO) Working Group of the Trusted Systems Interoperability Group\n   (TSIG)\
    \ [FIPS-188].  The IP Security Option defined by RFC 1038 was\n   designed with\
    \ one specific purpose in mind: to support the fielding\n   of an IPv4 packet-encryption\
    \ device called a BLACKER [RFC1038].\n   Because of this, the definitions and\
    \ assumptions in those documents\n   were necessarily focused on the US Department\
    \ of Defense and the\n   BLACKER device.  Today, IP packet Sensitivity Labeling\
    \ is most\n   commonly deployed within Multi-Level Secure (MLS) environments,\
    \ often\n   composed of Compartmented Mode Workstations (CMWs) connected via a\n\
    \   Local Area Network (LAN).  So the mechanism defined here is\n   accordingly\
    \ more general than either RFC 1038 or RFC 1108 were.\n   Also, the deployment\
    \ of Compartmented Mode Workstations ran into\n   operational constraints caused\
    \ by the limited, and relatively small,\n   space available for IPv4 options.\
    \  This caused one non-IETF\n   specification for IPv4 packet labeling to have\
    \ a large number of\n   sub-options.  A very unfortunate side effect of having\
    \ sub-options\n   within an IPv4 label option was that it became much more challenging\n\
    \   to implement Intermediate System support for Mandatory Access\n   Controls\
    \ (e.g., in a router or MLS guard system) and still be able to\n   forward traffic\
    \ at, or near, wire-speed.\n   In the last decade or so, typical Ethernet link\
    \ speeds have changed\n   from 10 Mbps half-duplex to 1 Gbps full-duplex.  The\
    \ 10 Gbps full-\n   duplex Ethernet standard is widely available today in routers,\n\
    \   Ethernet switches, and even in some servers.  The IEEE is actively\n   developing\
    \ standards for both 40 Gbps Ethernet and 100 Gbps Ethernet\n   as of this writing.\
    \  Forwarding at those speeds typically requires\n   support from Application-Specific\
    \ Integrated Circuits (ASICs);\n   supporting more complex packet formats usually\
    \ requires significantly\n   more gates than supporting simpler packet formats.\
    \  So the pressure\n   to have a single simple option format has only increased\
    \ in the past\n   decade, and is only going to increase in the future.\n   When\
    \ IPv6 was initially being developed, it was anticipated that the\n   availability\
    \ of IP Security, in particular the Encapsulating Security\n   Payload (ESP) and\
    \ the IP Authentication Header (AH), would obviate\n   the need for explicit packet\
    \ Sensitivity Labels with IPv6 [RFC1825]\n   [RFC4301] [RFC4302] [RFC4303].  For\
    \ MLS IPv6 deployments where the\n   use of AH or ESP is practical, the use of\
    \ AH and/or ESP is\n   recommended.\n   However, some applications (e.g., distributed\
    \ file systems), most\n   often those not designed for use with Compartmented\
    \ Mode Workstations\n   or other Multi-Level Secure (MLS) computers, multiplex\
    \ different\n   transactions at different Sensitivity Levels and/or with different\n\
    \   privileges over a single IP communications session (e.g., with the\n   User\
    \ Datagram Protocol).  In order to maintain data Sensitivity\n   Labeling for\
    \ such applications, to be able to implement routing and\n   Mandatory Access\
    \ Control decisions in routers and guards on a per-\n   IP-packet basis, and for\
    \ other reasons, there is a need to have a\n   mechanism for explicitly labeling\
    \ the sensitivity information for\n   each IPv6 packet.\n   Existing Layer 3 Virtual\
    \ Private Network (VPN) technology can't solve\n   the set of issues addressed\
    \ by this specification, for several\n   independent reasons.  First, in a typical\
    \ deployment, many labeled\n   packets will flow from an MLS End System through\
    \ some set of networks\n   to a receiving MLS End System.  The received per-packet\
    \ label is used\n   by the receiving MLS End System to determine which Sensitivity\
    \ Label\n   to associate with the user data carried in the packet.  Existing\n\
    \   Layer 3 VPN specifications do not specify any mechanism to carry a\n   Sensitivity\
    \ Label.  Second, existing Layer 3 VPN technologies are not\n   implemented in\
    \ any MLS End Systems, nor in typical single-level End\n   System operating systems,\
    \ but instead typically are only implemented\n   in routers.  Adding a Layer 3\
    \ VPN implementation to the networking\n   stack of an MLS End System would be\
    \ a great deal more work than\n   adding this IPv6 option to that same MLS End\
    \ System.  Third, existing\n   Layer 3 VPN specifications do not support the use\
    \ of Sensitivity\n   Labels to select a VPN to use in carrying a packet, which\
    \ function is\n   essential if one wanted to obviate this IPv6 option.  Substantial\
    \ new\n   standards development, along with significant new implementation work\n\
    \   in End Systems, would be required before a Layer 3 VPN approach to\n   these\
    \ issues could be used.  Developing such specifications, and then\n   implementing\
    \ them in MLS systems, would need substantially greater\n   effort than simply\
    \ implementing this IPv6 label option in an MLS End\n   System (or in a label-aware\
    \ router).  Further, both the MLS user\n   community and the MLS implementer community\
    \ prefer the approach\n   defined in this specification.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Intent and Applicability
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Intent and Applicability\n   Nothing in this document applies to any system\
    \ that does not claim to\n   implement this document.\n   This document describes\
    \ a generic way of labeling IPv6 datagrams to\n   reflect their particular sensitivity.\
    \  Provision is made for\n   separating data based on domain of interpretation\
    \ (e.g., an agency, a\n   country, an alliance, or a coalition), the relative\
    \ sensitivity\n   (i.e., Sensitivity Levels), and need-to-know or formal access\n\
    \   programs (i.e., compartments or categories).\n   A commonly used method of\
    \ encoding Releasabilities as if they were\n   Compartments is also described.\
    \  This usage does not have precisely\n   the same semantics as some formal Releasability\
    \ policies, but\n   existing Multi-Level Secure operating systems do not contain\n\
    \   operating system support for Releasabilities as a separate concept\n   from\
    \ compartments.  The semantics for this sort of Releasability\n   encoding is\
    \ close to the formal policies and has been deployed by a\n   number of different\
    \ organizations for at least a decade now.\n   In particular, the authors believe\
    \ that this mechanism is suitable\n   for deployment in United Nations (UN) peace-keeping\
    \ operations, in\n   North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) or other coalition\n\
    \   operations, in all current US Government MLS environments, and for\n   deployment\
    \ in other similar commercial or governmental environments.\n   This option would\
    \ not normally ever be visible in an IP packet on the\n   global public Internet.\n\
    \   Because of the unusually severe adverse consequences (e.g., loss of\n   life,\
    \ loss of very large sums of money) likely if a packet labeled\n   with this IPv6\
    \ Option were to escape onto the global public Internet,\n   organizations deploying\
    \ this mechanism have unusually strong\n   incentives to configure security controls\
    \ to prevent labeled packets\n   from ever appearing on the global public Internet.\
    \  Indeed, a primary\n   purpose of this mechanism is to enable deployment of\
    \ Mandatory Access\n   Controls for IPv6 packets.\n   However, to ensure interoperability\
    \ of both End Systems and\n   Intermediate Systems within such a labeled deployment\
    \ of IPv6, it is\n   essential to have an open specification for this option.\n\
    \   This option is NOT designed to be an all-purpose label option and\n   specifically\
    \ does not include support for generic Domain Type\n   Enforcement (DTE) mechanisms.\
    \  If such a DTE label option is desired,\n   it ought to be separately specified\
    \ and have its own (i.e.,\n   different) IPv6 option number.\n   The key words\
    \ \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\"\
    , \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document\
    \ are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 1.3.  Deployment Examples
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Deployment Examples\n   Two deployment scenarios for IP packet Sensitivity\
    \ Labels are most\n   common.  We should first note that in typical deployments,\
    \ all people\n   having access to an unencrypted link are cleared for all unencrypted\n\
    \   information traversing that link.  Also, MLS system administrators\n   normally\
    \ have previously been cleared to see all of the information\n   processed or\
    \ stored by that MLS system.  This specification does not\n   seek to eliminate\
    \ all potential covert channels relating to this IPv6\n   option.\n   In the first\
    \ scenario, all the connected nodes in a given private\n   internetwork are trusted\
    \ systems that have Multi-Level Secure (MLS)\n   operating systems, such as Compartmented\
    \ Mode Workstations (CMWs),\n   that support per-packet Sensitivity Labels [TCSEC]\
    \ [TNI] [CMW]\n   [MLOSPP].  In this type of deployment, all IP packets carried\
    \ within\n   the private internetwork are labeled, the IP routers apply mandatory\n\
    \   access controls (MAC) based on the packet labels and the sensitivity\n   ranges\
    \ configured into the routers, all End Systems include packet\n   Sensitivity\
    \ Labels in each originated packet, and all End Systems\n   apply Mandatory Access\
    \ Controls to each received packet.  Packets\n   received by a router or End System\
    \ that have a Sensitivity Label\n   outside the permitted range for the receiving\
    \ interface (or, in the\n   case of a router, outside the permitted range for\
    \ either the incoming\n   or the outgoing interface) are dropped because they\
    \ violate the MAC\n   policy.\n   The second scenario is a variation of the first,\
    \ where End Systems\n   with non-MLS operating systems are present on certain\
    \ subnetworks of\n   the private internetwork.  By definition, these non-MLS End\
    \ Systems\n   operate in \"system high\" mode.  In \"system high\" mode, all\n\
    \   information on the system is considered to have the sensitivity of\n   the\
    \ most sensitive data on the system.  If a system happens to\n   contain data\
    \ only at one Sensitivity Level, this would also be an\n   example of \"system\
    \ high\" operation.  In this scenario, each\n   subnetwork that contains any single-level\
    \ End Systems has one single\n   \"default\" Sensitivity Label that applies to\
    \ all single-level systems\n   on that IP subnetwork.  Because those non-MLS End\
    \ Systems are unable\n   to create packets containing Sensitivity Labels and are\
    \ also unable\n   to apply MAC enforcement on received packets, security gateways\n\
    \   (which might, for example, be label-aware IP routers) connected to\n   such\
    \ subnetworks need to insert sensitivity labels to packets\n   originated by the\
    \ \"system high\" End Systems that are to be forwarded\n   off subnet.  While\
    \ the CALIPSO IPv6 option is marked as \"ignore if\n   unrecognized\", there are\
    \ some deployed IPv6 End Systems with bugs.\n   Users can't fix these operating\
    \ system bugs; some users need to be\n   able to integrate their existing IPv6\
    \ single-level End Systems to\n   have a useful overall MLS deployment.  So, for\
    \ packets destined for\n   IP subnetworks containing single-level End Systems,\
    \ those last-hop\n   security gateways also apply Mandatory Access Controls (MAC)\
    \ and then\n   either drop (if the packet is not permitted on that destination\n\
    \   subnet) exclusive-or remove Sensitivity Labels and forward packets\n   onto\
    \ those \"system high\" subnetworks (if the packet is permitted on\n   that destination\
    \ subnetwork).\n   The authors are not aware of any existing MLS network deployments\n\
    \   that use a commercial Network Address Translation (NAT), Network\n   Address\
    \ and Port Translation (NAPT), or any other commercial\n   \"middlebox\" device.\
    \  For example, NAT boxes aren't used, unlike\n   practices in some segments of\
    \ the public Internet.\n   Similarly, the authors are not aware of any existing\
    \ MLS network\n   deployments that use a commercial firewall.  MLS networks normally\n\
    \   are both physically and electronically isolated from the global\n   Internet,\
    \ so operators of MLS networks are not concerned about\n   external penetration\
    \ (e.g., by worms, viruses, or the like).\n   Similarly, all users of the MLS\
    \ network have been cleared using some\n   process specific to that organization,\
    \ and hence are believe to be\n   trustworthy.  In a typical deployment, all computers\
    \ connected to the\n   MLS network are in a physically secure room or building\
    \ (e.g.,\n   protected by guards with guns).  Electronic equipment that enters\n\
    \   such a space typically does not leave.  Items such as USB memory\n   sticks\
    \ are generally not permitted; in fact, often the USB ports on\n   MLS computers\
    \ have been removed or otherwise made inoperable to\n   prevent people from adding\
    \ or removing information.\n   Also, for security reasons, content transformation\
    \ in the middle of\n   an MLS network is widely considered undesirable, and so\
    \ is not\n   typically undertaken.  Hypothetically, if such content transformation\n\
    \   were undertaken, it would be performed by a certified MLS system that\n  \
    \ has been suitably accredited for that particular purpose in that\n   particular\
    \ deployment.\n"
- title: 2.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.  Definitions\n   This section defines several terms that are important to\n\
    \   understanding and correctly implementing this specification.  Because\n  \
    \ of historical variations in terminology in different user\n   communities, several\
    \ terms have defined synonyms.\n   The verb \"dominate\" is used in this document\
    \ to describe comparison\n   of two Sensitivity Labels within a given Domain of\
    \ Interpretation.\n   Sensitivity Label A dominates Sensitivity Label B if the\
    \ Sensitivity\n   Level of A is greater than or equal to the Sensitivity Level\
    \ of B AND\n   the Compartment Set of A is a superset (proper or improper) of\
    \ the\n   Compartment Set of B.  This term has been used in Multi-Level Secure\n\
    \   circles with this meaning for at least two decades.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Domain of Interpretation
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Domain of Interpretation\n   A Domain of Interpretation (DOI) is a shorthand\
    \ way of identifying\n   the use of a particular labeling, classification, and\
    \ handling system\n   with respect to data, the computers and people who process\
    \ it, and\n   the networks that carry it.  The DOI policies, combined with a\n\
    \   particular Sensitivity Label (which is defined to have meaning within\n  \
    \ that DOI) applied to a datum or collection of data, dictates which\n   systems,\
    \ and ultimately which persons may receive that data.\n   In other words, a label\
    \ of \"SECRET\" by itself is not meaningful; one\n   also must know that the document\
    \ or data belongs to some specific\n   organization (e.g., US Department of Defense\
    \ (DoD), US Department of\n   Energy (DoE), UK Ministry of Defence (MoD), North\
    \ Atlantic Treaty\n   Organisation (NATO), United Nations (UN), a specific commercial\
    \ firm)\n   before one can decide on who is allowed to receive the data.\n   A\
    \ CALIPSO DOI is an opaque identifier that is used as a pointer to a\n   particular\
    \ set of policies, which define the Sensitivity Levels and\n   Compartments present\
    \ within the DOI, and by inference, to the \"real-\n   world\" (e.g., used on\
    \ paper documents) equivalent labels (See\n   \"Sensitivity Label\" below).  Registering\
    \ or defining a set of real-\n   world security policies as a CALIPSO DOI results\
    \ in a standard way of\n   labeling IP data originating from End Systems \"accredited\"\
    \ or\n   \"approved\" to operate within that DOI and the constraints of those\n\
    \   security policies.  For example, if one did this for the US\n   Department\
    \ of Defense, one would list all the acceptable labels such\n   as \"SECRET\"\
    \ and \"TOP SECRET\", and one would link the CALIPSO DOI to\n   the [DoD5200.28]\
    \ and [DoD5200.1-R] documents, which define how to\n   mark and protect data with\
    \ the US Department of Defense (DoD)\n   [DoD5200.28] [DoD5200.1-R].\n   The scope\
    \ of the DOI is dependent on the organization creating it.\n   In some cases,\
    \ the creator of the DOI might not be identical to a\n   given user of the DOI.\
    \  For example, a multi-national organization\n   (e.g., NATO) might create a\
    \ DOI, while a given member nation or\n   organization (e.g., UK MoD) might be\
    \ using that multi-national DOI\n   (possibly along with other DOIs created by\
    \ others) within its private\n   networks.  To provide a different example, the\
    \ United States might\n   establish a DOI with specific meanings, which correspond\
    \ to the\n   normal way it labels classified documents and which would apply\n\
    \   primarily to the US DoD, but those specific meanings might also apply\n  \
    \ to other associated agencies.  A company or other organization also\n   might\
    \ establish a DOI, which applies only to itself.\n   NOTE WELL: A CALIPSO Domain\
    \ of Interpretation is different from, and\n   is disjoint from, an Internet Security\
    \ Association and Key Management\n   Protocol (ISAKMP) / Internet Key Exchange\
    \ (IKE) Domain of\n   Interpretation.  It is important not to confuse the two\
    \ different\n   concepts, even though the terms might superficially appear to\
    \ be\n   similar.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Sensitivity Level
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Sensitivity Level\n   A Sensitivity Level represents a mandatory separation\
    \ of data based\n   on relative sensitivity.  Sensitivity Levels ALWAYS have a\
    \ specific\n   ordering within a DOI.  Clearance to access a specific level of\
    \ data\n   also implies access to all levels whose sensitivity is less than that\n\
    \   level.  For example, if the A, B, and C are levels, and A is more\n   sensitive\

    \ protect data critical to its success -- only employees with a\n   specific need\
    \ to know (e.g., the accountants and controller for\n   \"FINANCE\", specific\

    \ a person \"Jane Doe\" who is a member of\n   two Releasability communities (A\
    \ and also B), she is permitted to see\n   a paper document that is marked \"\
    Releasable A\", \"Releasable B\", or\n   \"Releasable AB\" -- provided that her\
    \ Clearance and Compartments are\n   in-range for the Sensitivity Level and Compartments\
    \ (respectively) of\n   the paper document.\n   Now, let us consider an equivalent\
    \ electronic example implemented and\n   deployed as outlined above.  In this,\
    \ we consider two Releasability\n   communities (A and B).  Those bits will be\
    \ set to 00 for the\n   electronic user ID used by user \"Jane Doe\".\n   However,\
    \ the electronic Releasability approach above will ONLY permit\n   her to see\
    \ information marked as \"Releasable AB\".  The above\n   electronic approach\
    \ will deny her the ability to read documents\n   marked \"Releasable A\" or \"\
    Releasable B\".  This is because \"Releasable\n   A\" is encoded as \"01\", \"\
    Releasable B\" is encoded as \"10\", while\n   \"Releasable AB\" is encoded as\
    \ \"00\".  If one looks at the compartment\n   dominance computation, \"00\" dominates\
    \ \"00\", but \"00\" does NOT\n   dominate \"01\", and \"00\" also does NOT dominate\
    \ \"10\".\n   Users report that the current situation is tolerable, but not ideal.\n\
    \   Users also report that various operational complexities can arise\n   from\
    \ this approach.\n   Several deployments work around this limitation by assigning\
    \ an\n   electronic user several parallel clearances.  Referring to the\n   (fictitious)\
    \ example above, the user \"Jane Doe\" might have one\n   clearance without any\
    \ Releasability, another separate clearance with\n   Releasability A, and a third\
    \ separate clearance with Releasability B.\n   While this has implications (e.g.,\
    \ a need to be able to associate\n   multiple separate parallel clearances with\
    \ a single user ID) for\n   implementers of MLS systems, this specification cannot\
    \ (and does not)\n   levy any requirements that an implementation be able to associate\n\
    \   multiple clearances with each given user ID because that level of\n   detail\
    \ is beyond the scope of an IP labeling option.\n   Separating the Releasability\
    \ bits into a separate bitmap within the\n   CALIPSO option was seriously considered.\
    \  However, existing MLS\n   implementations lack operating system support for\
    \ Releasability.  So\n   even if CALIPSO had a separate bitmap field, those bits\
    \ would have\n   been mapped to Compartment bits by the sending/receiving nodes,\
    \ so\n   the operational results would not have been different than those\n  \
    \ described here.\n   Several MLS network deployments connect MLS End Systems\
    \ both to a\n   labeled national network and also to a labeled coalition network\n\
    \   simultaneously.  Depending on whether the data is labeled according\n   to\
    \ national rules or according to coalition rules, the set of\n   Releasability\
    \ marks will vary.  Some choices are likely to lead to\n   more (or fewer) incorrect\
    \ Releasability decisions (although the\n   results of the above Releasability\
    \ encodings are believed to be\n   fail-safe).\n"

    \ example is the security classification system in use within the UK\n   Government.\
    \  Some data held by the government is \"classified\", and is\n   therefore restricted\
    \ by law to those people who have the appropriate\n   \"clearances\".\n   Commercial\
    \ examples of information labeling schemes also exist\n   [CW87].  For example,\
    \ one global electrical equipment company has a\n   formal security policy that\
    \ defines six different Sensitivity Levels\n   for its internal data, ranging\
    \ from \"Class 1\" to \"Class 6\"\n   information.  Some financial institutions\
    \ use multiple compartments\n   to restrict access to certain information (e.g.,\

    \ those projects\n   and to deny access to other groups within the company (e.g.,\

    \   Control (MAC) policy for information with differing (\"vertical\")\n   Sensitivity\
    \ Levels.  This document builds upon the formal definitions\n   of Bell-LaPadula\
    \ [BL73].  There are two basic principles: \"no write\n   down\" and \"no read\

    \ Level below X.  The second rule means that an entity\n   having maximum Sensitivity\
    \ Level X must not be able to read\n   information having a Sensitivity Level\
    \ above X.  In a normal\n   deployment, information downgrading (\"write down\"\

    ) the information.  Subsequent to the original work by\n   Bell and LaPadula in\
    \ this area, this formal model was extended to\n   also support (\"horizontal\"\
    ) Compartments of information.\n   This document extends Bell-LaPadula to accommodate\
    \ the notion of\n   separate Domains of Interpretation (DOI) [BL73].  Each DOI\n\
    \   constitutes a single comparable domain of Sensitivity Labels as\n   stated\
    \ by Bell-LaPadula.  Sensitivity Labels from different domains\n   cannot be directly\
    \ compared using Bell-LaPadula semantics.\n   This document is focused on providing\
    \ specifications for (1) encoding\n   Sensitivity Labels in packets, and (2) how\
    \ such Sensitivity Labels\n   are to be interpreted and enforced at the IP layer.\
    \  This document\n   recognizes that there are several kinds of application processing\n\
    \   that occur above the IP layer that significantly impact end-to-end\n   system\
    \ security policy enforcement, but are out of scope for this\n   document.  In\
    \ particular, how the network labeling policy is enforced\n   within processing\
    \ in an End System is critical, but is beyond the\n   scope of a network (IP)\
    \ layer Sensitivity Label encoding standard.\n   Other specifications exist, which\
    \ discuss such details [TCSEC] [TNI]\n   [CMW] [ISO-15408] [CC] [MLOSPP].\n  \
    \ This specification does not preclude an End System capable of\n   providing\
    \ labeled packets across some range of Sensitivity Labels.  A\n   Compartmented\
    \ Mode Workstation (CMW) is an example of such an End\n   System [CMW].  This\
    \ is useful if the End System is capable of, and\n   accredited to, separate processing\
    \ across some range of Sensitivity\n   Labels.  Such a node would have a range\
    \ associated with it within the\n   network interface connecting the node to the\
    \ network.  As an example,\n   an End System has the range \"SECRET: TOP SECRET\"\
    \ associated with it\n   in the Intermediate System to which the node is attached.\
    \  SECRET\n   processing on the node is allowed to traverse the network to other\n\
    \   \"SECRET :  SECRET\" segments of the network, ultimately to a \"SECRET :\n\
    \   SECRET\" node.  Likewise, TOP SECRET processing on the node is allowed\n \
    \  to traverse a network through \"TOP SECRET: TOP SECRET\" segments,\n   ultimately\
    \ to some \"TOP SECRET: TOP SECRET\" node.  The node in this\n   case can allow\
    \ a user on this node to access SECRET and TOP SECRET\n   resources, provided\
    \ the user holds the appropriate clearances and has\n   been correctly configured.\n\
    \   With respect to a given network, each distinct Sensitivity Label\n   represents\
    \ a separate virtual network, which shares the same physical\n   network.  There\
    \ are rules for moving information between the various\n   virtual networks. \
    \ The model we use within this document is based on\n   the Bell-LaPadula model,\
    \ but is extended to cover the concept of\n   differing Domains of Interpretation.\
    \  Nodes that implement this\n   protocol MUST enforce this mandatory separation\
    \ of data.\n   CALIPSO provides for both horizontal (\"Compartment\") and vertical\n\
    \   (\"Sensitivity Level\") separation of information, as well as\n   separation\
    \ based on DOI.  The basic rule is that data MUST NOT be\n   delivered to a user\
    \ or system that is not approved to receive it.\n   NOTE WELL: Wherever we say\
    \ \"not approved\", we also mean \"not\n   cleared\", \"not certified\", and/or\
    \ \"not accredited\" as applicable in\n   one's operational community.\n   This\
    \ specification does not enable AUTOMATIC relabeling of\n   information, within\
    \ a DOI or to a different DOI.  That is, neither\n   automatic \"upgrading\" nor\
    \ automatic \"downgrading\" of information are\n   enabled by this specification.\
    \  Local security policies might allow\n   some limited downgrading, but this\
    \ normally requires the intervention\n   of some human entity and is usually done\
    \ within an End System with\n   respect to the internal Sensitivity Label, rather\
    \ than on a network\n   or in an intermediate-system (e.g., router, guard).  Automatic\n\
    \   downgrading is not suggested operational practice; further discussion\n  \
    \ of downgrading is outside the scope of this protocol specification.\n   Implementers\
    \ of this specification MUST NOT permit automatic\n   upgrading or downgrading\
    \ of information in the default configuration\n   of their implementation.  Implementers\
    \ MAY add a configuration knob\n   that would permit a System Security Officer\
    \ holding appropriate\n   privilege to enable automatic upgrading or downgrading\
    \ of\n   information.  If an implementation supports such a knob, the\n   existence\
    \ of the configuration knob must be clearly documented and\n   the default knob\
    \ setting MUST be that automatic upgrading or\n   downgrading is DISABLED.  Automatic\
    \ information upgrading and\n   downgrading is not recommended operational practice.\n\
    \   Many existing MLS deployments already use (and operationally need to\n   use)\
    \ more than one DOI concurrently.  User feedback from early\n   versions of this\
    \ specification indicates that it is common at present\n   for a single network\
    \ link (i.e., IP subnetwork) to carry traffic for\n   both a particular coalition\
    \ (or joint-venture) activity and also for\n   the government (or other organization)\
    \ that owns and operates that\n   particular network link.  On such a link, one\
    \ CALIPSO DOI would\n   typically be used for the coalition traffic and some different\n\
    \   CALIPSO DOI would typically be used for non-coalition traffic (i.e.,\n   traffic\
    \ that is specific to the government that owns and operates\n   that particular\
    \ network link).  For example, a UK military network\n   that is part of a NATO\
    \ deployment might have and use a UK MoD DOI for\n   information originating/terminating\
    \ on another UK system, while\n   concurrently using a different NATO DOI for\
    \ information\n   originating/terminating on a non-UK NATO system.\n   Additionally,\
    \ operational experience with existing MLS systems has\n   shown that if a system\
    \ only supports a single DOI at a given time,\n   then it is impossible for a\
    \ deployment to migrate from using one DOI\n   value to a different DOI value\
    \ in a smooth, lossless, zero downtime,\n   manner.\n   Therefore, a node that\
    \ implements this specification MUST be able to\n   support at least two CALIPSO\
    \ DOIs concurrently.  Support for more\n   than two concurrent CALIPSO DOIs is\
    \ encouraged.  This requirement to\n   support at least two CALIPSO DOIs concurrently\
    \ is not necessarily an\n   implementation constraint upon MLS operating system\
    \ internals that\n   are unrelated to the network.\n   Indeed, use of multiple\
    \ DOIs is also operationally useful in\n   deployments having a single administration\
    \ that also have very large\n   numbers of compartments.  For example, such a\
    \ deployment might have\n   one set of related compartments in one CALIPSO DOI\
    \ and a different\n   set of compartments in a different CALIPSO DOI.  Some compartments\n\
    \   might be present in both DOIs, possibly at different bit positions of\n  \
    \ the compartment bitmap in different DOIs.  While this might make some\n   implementations\
    \ more complex, it might also be used to reduce the\n   typical size of the IPv6\
    \ CALIPSO option in data packets.\n   Moving information between any two DOIs\
    \ is permitted -- if and only\n   if -- the owners of the DOIs:\n        1) Agree\
    \ to the exchange,\n   AND\n        2) Publish a document with a table of equivalencies\
    \ that\n           maps the CALIPSO values of one DOI into the other\n       \
    \    and make that document available to security\n           administrators of\
    \ MLS systems within the deployment\n           scope of those two DOIs.\n   The\
    \ owners of two DOIs may choose to permit the exchange on or\n   between any of\
    \ their systems, or may restrict exchange to a small\n   subset of the systems\
    \ they own/accredit.  One-way agreements are\n   permissible, as are agreements\
    \ that are a subset of the full table of\n   equivalences.  Actual administration\
    \ of inter-DOI agreements is\n   outside the scope of this document.\n   When\
    \ data leaves an End System it is exported to the network, and\n   marked with\
    \ a particular DOI, Sensitivity Level, and Compartment Set.\n   (This triple is\
    \ collectively termed a Sensitivity Label.)  This\n   Sensitivity Label is derived\
    \ from the internal Sensitivity Label (the\n   end-system-specific implementation\
    \ of a given Sensitivity Label), and\n   the Export DOI.  Selection of the Export\
    \ DOI is described in detail\n   in Section 6.2.1.\n   When data arrives at an\
    \ End System, it is imported from the network\n   to the End System.  The data\
    \ from the datagram takes on an internal\n   Sensitivity Label based on the Sensitivity\
    \ Label contained in the\n   datagram.  This assumes the datagram is marked with\
    \ a recognizable\n   DOI, there is a corresponding internal Sensitivity Label\
    \ equivalent\n   to the CALIPSO Sensitivity Label, and the datagram is \"within\
    \ range\"\n   for the receiving logical interface.\n   A node has one or more\
    \ physical interfaces.  Each physical interface\n   is associated with a physical\
    \ network segment used to connect the\n   node, router, LAN, or WAN.  One or more\
    \ Sensitivity Label ranges are\n   associated with each physical network interface.\
    \  Sensitivity Label\n   ranges from multiple DOIs must be enumerated separately.\
    \  Multiple\n   ranges from the same DOI are permissible.\n   Each node also might\
    \ have one or more logical network interfaces.\n   A given logical network interface\
    \ might be associated with more than\n   one physical interface.  For example,\
    \ a switch/router might have two\n   separate Ethernet ports that are associated\
    \ with the same Virtual\n   Local Area Network (VLAN), where that one VLAN mapped\
    \ to a single\n   IPv6 subnetwork [IEEE802.1Q].\n   A given physical network interface\
    \ might have more than one\n   associated logical interface.  For example, a node\
    \ might have 2\n   logical network interfaces, each for a different IP subnetwork\n\
    \   (\"super-netting\"), on a single physical network interface (e.g., on a\n\
    \   single Network Interface Card of a personal computer).\n   Alternatively,\
    \ also as an example, a single Ethernet port might have\n   multiple Virtual LANs\
    \ (VLANs) associated with it, where each VLAN\n   could be a separate logical\
    \ network interface.\n   One or more Sensitivity Label ranges are associated with\
    \ each logical\n   network interface.  Sensitivity Label ranges from multiple\
    \ DOIs must\n   be enumerated separately.  Multiple ranges from the same DOI are\n\
    \   permissible.  Each range associated with a logical interface must\n   fall\
    \ within a range separately defined for the corresponding physical\n   interface.\n\
    \   There is specific user interest in having IPv6 routers that can apply\n  \
    \ per-logical-interface mandatory access controls based on the contents\n   of\
    \ the CALIPSO Sensitivity Labels in IPv6 packets.  The authors note\n   that since\
    \ the early 1990s, and continuing through today, some\n   commercial IPv4 router\
    \ products provide MAC enforcement for the RFC\n   1108 IP Security Option.\n\
    \   In transit, a datagram is handled based on its CALIPSO Sensitivity\n   Label,\
    \ and is usually neither imported to or exported from the\n   various Intermediate\
    \ Systems it transits.  There also is the concept\n   of \"CALIPSO Gateways\"\
    , which import data from one DOI and export it\n   to another DOI such that the\
    \ effective Sensitivity Label is NOT\n   changed, but is merely represented using\
    \ a different DOI.  In other\n   words, such devices would be trustworthy, trusted,\
    \ and authorized to\n   provide on-the-fly relabeling of packets at the boundaries\
    \ between\n   complete systems of End Systems within a single DOI.  Typically,\
    \ such\n   systems require specific certification(s) and accreditation(s) before\n\
    \   deployment or use.\n"
- title: 4.  Defaults
  contents:
  - "4.  Defaults\n   This Section describes the default behavior of CALIPSO-compliant\
    \ End\n   Systems and Intermediate Systems.  Implementers MAY implement\n   configuration\
    \ knobs to vary from this behavior, provided that the\n   default behavior (i.e.,\
    \ if the system administrator does not\n   explicitly change the configured behavior\
    \ of the device) is as\n   described below.  If implementers choose to implement\
    \ such\n   configuration knobs, the configuration parameters and the behaviors\n\
    \   that they enable and disable SHOULD be documented for the benefit of\n   system\
    \ administrators of those devices.\n   Each Intermediate System or End System\
    \ is responsible for properly\n   interpreting and enforcing the MLS Mandatory\
    \ Access Control policy.\n   Practically, this means that each node must evaluate\
    \ the label on the\n   inbound packet, ensure that this Sensitivity Label is valid\
    \ (i.e.,\n   within range) for the receiving interface, and at a minimum only\n\
    \   forward the packet to an interface and node where the Sensitivity\n   Label\
    \ of the packet falls within the assigned range of that node's\n   receiving interface.\n\
    \   Packets with an invalid (e.g., out-of-range) Sensitivity Label for\n   the\
    \ receiving interface MUST be dropped upon receipt.  A Sensitivity\n   Label is\
    \ valid if and only if the Sensitivity Label falls within the\n   range assigned\
    \ to the transmitting interface on the sending system\n   and within the range\
    \ assigned to the receiving interface on the\n   receiving system.  These rules\
    \ also need to be applied by\n   Intermediate Systems on each hop that a CALIPSO-labeled\
    \ packet\n   traverses, not merely at the end points of a labeled IP session.\
    \  As\n   an example, it is a violation of the default MLS MAC policy for a\n\
    \   packet with a higher Sensitivity Level (e.g., \"MOST SECRET\") to\n   transit\
    \ a link whose maximum Sensitivity Level is less than that\n   first Sensitivity\
    \ Level (e.g., \"SECRET\").\n   If an unlabeled packet is received from a node\
    \ that does not support\n   CALIPSO Sensitivity Labels (i.e., unable to assign\
    \ Sensitivity Labels\n   itself) and the packet is destined for a node that supports\
    \ CALIPSO\n   Sensitivity Labels, then the receiving intermediate system needs\
    \ to\n   insert a Sensitivity Label.  This Sensitivity Label MUST be equal to\n\
    \   the maximum Sensitivity Label assigned to the originating node if and\n  \
    \ only if that is known to the receiving node.  If this receiving\n   Intermediate\
    \ System does not know which Sensitivity Label is assigned\n   to the originating\
    \ node, then the maximum Sensitivity Label of the\n   interface that received\
    \ the unlabeled packet MUST be inserted.\n   NOTE WELL: The procedure in the preceding\
    \ paragraph is NOT a label\n   upgrade -- because it is not changing an existing\
    \ label; instead, it\n   is simply inserting a Sensitivity Label that has the\
    \ only \"safe\"\n   value, given that no other information is known to the receiving\n\
    \   node.  In large-scale deployments, it is very unlikely that a given\n   node\
    \ will have any authoritative a priori information about the\n   security configuration\
    \ of any node that is NOT on a directly attached\n   link.\n   If a packet is\
    \ to be sent to a node that is defined to not be\n   Sensitivity Label aware,\
    \ from a node that is label aware, then the\n   Sensitivity Label MAY be removed\
    \ upon transmission if and only if\n   local security policy explicitly permits\
    \ this.  The originating node\n   is still responsible for ensuring that the Sensitivity\
    \ Label on the\n   packet falls within the Sensitivity Label range associated\
    \ with the\n   receiving node.  If the packet will traverse more than one subnetwork\n\
    \   between origin and destination, and those subnetworks are labeled,\n   then\
    \ the packet SHOULD normally contain a Sensitivity Label so that\n   the packet\
    \ will be able to reach the destination and the Intermediate\n   Systems will\
    \ be able to apply the requisite MAC policy to the packet.\n   NOTE WELL: In some\
    \ IPv4 MLS network deployments that exist as of the\n   publication date, if a\
    \ first-hop router receives an unlabeled IPv4\n   packet, the router inserts an\
    \ appropriate Sensitivity Label into that\n   IPv4 packet, in the manner described\
    \ above.  So sending a packet\n   without a label across a multiple subnetwork\
    \ path to a destination\n   does not guarantee that the packet will arrive containing\
    \ no\n   Sensitivity Label.\n"
- title: 5.  Format
  contents:
  - "5.  Format\n   This section describes the format of the CALIPSO option for use\
    \ with\n   IPv6 datagrams.  CALIPSO is an IPv6 Hop-By-Hop Option, rather than\
    \ an\n   IPv6 Destination Option, to ensure that a security gateway or router\n\
    \   can apply access controls to IPv6 packets based on the CALIPSO label\n   carried\
    \ by the packet.\n   An IPv6 datagram that has not been tunneled contains at most\
    \ one\n   CALIPSO label.  In the special case where (1) a labeled IPv6 datagram\n\
    \   is tunneled inside another labeled IPv6 datagram AND (2) IP Security\n   is\
    \ NOT providing confidentiality protection for the inner packet, the\n   outer\
    \ CALIPSO Sensitivity Label must have the same meaning as the\n   inner CALIPSO\
    \ Sensitivity Label.  For example, it would be invalid to\n   encapsulate an unencrypted\
    \ IPv6 packet with a Sensitivity Label of\n   (SECRET, no compartments) inside\
    \ a packet with an outer Sensitivity\n   Label of (UNCLASSIFIED).\n   If the inner\
    \ IPv6 packet is tunneled inside the Encapsulating\n   Security Payload (ESP)\
    \ and confidentiality is being provided to that\n   inner packet, then the outer\
    \ packet MAY have a different CALIPSO\n   Sensitivity Label -- subject to local\
    \ security policy.\n   As a general principle, the meaning of the Sensitivity\
    \ Labels must be\n   identical when one has a labeled cleartext IP packet that\
    \ has been\n   encapsulated (tunneled) inside another labeled IP packet.  This\
    \ is\n   true whether one has IPv6 tunneled in IPv6, IPv4 tunneled in IPv6, or\n\
    \   IPv6 tunneled in IPv4.  This is essential to maintaining proper\n   Mandatory\
    \ Access Controls.\n   This option's syntax has been designed with intermediate\
    \ systems in\n   mind.  It is now common for an MLS network deployment to contain\
    \ an\n   Intermediate Systems acting as a guard (sometimes several acting as\n\
    \   guards).  Such a guard device needs to be able to very rapidly parse\n   the\
    \ Sensitivity Label in each packet, apply ingress interface MAC\n   policy, forward\
    \ the packet while aware of the packet's Sensitivity\n   Label, and then apply\
    \ egress interface MAC policy.\n   At least one prior IP Sensitivity Label option\
    \ [FIPS-188] used a\n   syntax that was unduly complex to parse in IP routers,\
    \ hence that\n   option never was implemented in an IP router.  So there is a\n\
    \   deliberate effort here to choose a streamlined option syntax that is\n   easy\
    \ to parse, encode, and implement in more general terms.\n"

  - "5.1.  Option Format\n   The CALIPSO option is an IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Option and is\
    \ designed to\n   comply with IPv6 optional header rules.  Following the nomenclature\n\
    \   of Section 4.2 of RFC 2460, the Option Type field of this option must\n  \
    \ have 4n+2 alignment [RFC2460].\n   The CALIPSO Option Data MUST NOT change en\
    \ route, except when (1)\n   \"DOI translation\" is performed by a trusted Intermediate\
    \ System, (2)\n   a CALIPSO Option is inserted by a trusted Intermediate System\
    \ upon\n   receipt of an unlabeled IPv6 packet, or (3) a CALIPSO Option is\n \
    \  removed by a last-hop trusted Intermediate System immediately prior\n   to\
    \ forwarding the packet to a destination node that does not\n   implement support\
    \ for CALIPSO labels.  The details of these three\n   exceptions are described\
    \ elsewhere in this document.\n   If the option type is not recognized by a node\
    \ examining the packet,\n   the option is ignored.  However, all implementations\
    \ of this\n   specification MUST be able to recognize this option and therefore\n\
    \   MUST NOT ignore this option if it is present in an IPv6 packet.\n   This option\
    \ is designed to comply with the IPv6 optional header rules\n   [RFC2460].  The\
    \ CALIPSO option is always carried in a Hop-By-Hop\n   Option Header, never in\
    \ any other part of an IPv6 packet.  This rule\n   exists because IPv6 routers\
    \ need to be able to see the CALIPSO label\n   so that those routers are able\
    \ to apply MLS Mandatory Access Controls\n   to those packets.\n   The diagram\
    \ below shows the CALIPSO option along with the required\n   (first) two fields\
    \ of the Hop-By-Hop Option Header that envelops the\n   CALIPSO option.  The design\

    \ words.  The\n   minimum value is zero, which is used only when the information\
    \ in\n   this packet is not in any compartment.  (In that situation, the\n   CALIPSO\

- title: 5.1.8.  Compartment Bitmap Field
  contents:
  - "5.1.8.  Compartment Bitmap Field\n   This contains a variable number of 64-bit\

    \ bit within an octet in the\n   Compartment Bitmap field represents a separate\
    \ compartment under\n   whose rules the data in this packet must be protected.\
    \  Hence, each\n   \"0\" bit indicates that the compartment corresponding with\
    \ that bit is\n   not applicable to the data in this packet.  The assignment of\n\
    \   identity to individual bits within a Compartment Bitmap for a given\n   DOI\
    \ is left to the owner of that DOI.\n   This specification represents a Releasability\

    export\" it\n   to the network.  Before a datagram can leave an end system and\
    \ be\n   transmitted over a network, the following ordered steps must occur:\n\
    \      1. Selection of the export DOI:\n        a) If the upper-level protocol\
    \ selects a DOI,\n           then that DOI is selected.\n        b) Else, if there\
    \ are tables defining a specific default\n           DOI for the specific destination\
    \ End System address\n           or for the network address, then that DOI is\
    \ selected.\n        c) Else, if there is a specific DOI associated with the\n\
    \           sending logical interface (i.e., IP address), then that\n        \
    \   DOI is selected.\n        d) Else the default DOI for the system is selected.\n\
    \   NOTE WELL: A connection-oriented transport-layer protocol session\n   (e.g.,\
    \ Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) session, Stream Control\n   Transmission\
    \ Protocol (SCTP) session) MUST have the same DOI and same\n   Sensitivity Label\
    \ for the life of that connection.  The DOI is\n   selected at connection initiation\
    \ and MUST NOT change during the\n   session.\n   A trusted multi-level application\
    \ that possesses appropriate\n   privilege MAY use multiple connection-oriented\
    \ transport-layer\n   protocol sessions with differing Sensitivity Labels concurrently.\n\
    \   Some trusted UDP-based applications (e.g., remote procedure call\n   service)\
    \ multiplex different transactions having different\n   Sensitivity Levels in\
    \ different packets for the same IP session\n   (e.g., IP addresses and UDP ports\
    \ are constant for a given UDP\n   session).  In such cases, the Trusted Computing\
    \ Base MUST ensure that\n   each packet is labeled with the correct Sensitivity\
    \ Label for the\n   information carried in that particular packet.\n   In the\
    \ event the End System selects and uses a specific DOI and that\n   DOI is not\
    \ recognized by the originating node's first-hop router, the\n   packet MUST be\
    \ dropped by the first-hop router.  In such a case, the\n   networking API should\
    \ indicate the connection failure (e.g., with\n   some appropriate error, such\
    \ as ENOTREACH).  This fault represents\n   (1) incorrect configuration of either\
    \ the Intermediate System or of\n   the End System or (2) correct operation for\
    \ a node that is not\n   permitted to send IPv6 packets with that DOI through\
    \ that\n   Intermediate System.\n   When an MLS End System is connected to an\
    \ MLS LAN, it is possible\n   that there would be more than one first-hop Intermediate\
    \ System\n   concurrently, with different Intermediate Systems having different\n\
    \   valid Sensitivity Label ranges.  Thoughtful use of the IEEE 802\n   Virtual\
    \ LAN (VLAN) standard (e.g., with different VLAN IDs\n   corresponding to different\
    \ sensitivity ranges) might ease proper\n   system configuration in such deployments.\n\
    \        2.  Export Labeling:\n        Once the DOI is selected, the CALIPSO Sensitivity\n\
    \        Label and values are determined based on the internal\n        Sensitivity\
    \ Label and the DOI.  In the event the internal\n        Sensitivity Level does\
    \ not map to a valid CALIPSO\n        Sensitivity Label, then an error SHOULD\
    \ be returned\n        to the upper-level protocol and that error MAY be\n   \
    \     logged.  No further attempt to send this datagram\n        should be made.\n\
    \        3.  Access Control:\n        Once the datagram is marked and the sending\
    \ logical\n        interface is selected (by the routing code), the\n        datagram's\
    \ Sensitivity Label is compared against the\n        Sensitivity Label range(s)\
    \ associated with that logical\n        interface.  For the datagram to be sent,\
    \ the interface\n        MUST list the DOI of the datagram Sensitivity Label as\n\
    \        one of the permissible DOI's and the datagram Sensitivity\n        Label\
    \ must be within range for the range associated with\n        that DOI.   If the\
    \ datagram fails this access test, then\n        an error SHOULD be returned to\
    \ the upper-level protocol\n        and MAY be logged.  No further attempt to\

    \ a CALIPSO\n   Sensitivity Label, to an internal Sensitivity Label, and then\
    \ back to\n   a new CALIPSO Sensitivity Label, exclusive-or a CALIPSO Sensitivity\n\
    \   Label can be directly remapped into a new CALIPSO Sensitivity Label.\n   The\
    \ first of these methods is the functional equivalent of\n   \"importing\" the\
    \ datagram then \"exporting\" it and is covered in detail\n   in the \"Import\"\
    \ (Section 6.2.2) and \"Export\" (Section 6.2.1) sections\n   above.\n   The remainder\
    \ of this section describes the second method, which is\n   direct relabeling.\
    \  The choice of which method to use for relabeling\n   is an implementation decision\
    \ outside the scope of this document.\n   A system that provides on-the-fly relabeling\
    \ without importing or\n   exporting is basically a special case of the Intermediate\
    \ System\n   rules listed above.  Translation or relabeling takes place AFTER\
    \ all\n   input checks take place, but before any output checks are done.\n  \
    \ Once a datagram has passed the Intermediate System input processing\n   and\
    \ input validation described in Section 6.3.1, and has been\n   accepted as valid,\
    \ the CALIPSO in that datagram may be relabeled.  To\n   determine the new Sensitivity\
    \ Label, first determine the new output\n   DOI.\n   The selection of the output\
    \ DOI may be based on any of Incoming DOI,\n   Incoming Sensitivity Label, Destination\
    \ End System, Destination\n   Network, Destination Subnetwork, Sending Interface,\
    \ or Receiving\n   Interface, or combinations thereof.  Exact details on how the\
    \ output\n   DOI is selected are implementation dependent, with the caveat that\
    \ it\n   should be consistent and reversible.  If a datagram from End System A\n\
    \   to End System B with DOI X maps into DOI Y, then a datagram from B to\n  \
    \ A with DOI Y should map into DOI X.\n   Once the output DOI is selected, the\
    \ output Sensitivity Label is\n   determined based on (1) the input DOI and input\
    \ Sensitivity Label and\n   (2) the output DOI.  In the event the input Sensitivity\
    \ Label does\n   not map to a valid output Sensitivity Label for the output DOI,\
    \ then\n   the datagram MUST be silently dropped and the drop event SHOULD be\n\
    \   logged as a security fault.\n   Once the datagram has been relabeled, the\

    \ is possible for a system that exists in multiple virtual networks to\n   have\
    \ identical SCTP connections, each one existing in a different\n   virtual network.\n\
    \   As with TCP, SCTP is a connection-oriented transport protocol and has\n  \
    \ substantial session state.  Unlike TCP, SCTP can support session-\n   endpoint\
    \ migration among IP addresses at the same end node(s), and\n   SCTP can also\
    \ support both one-to-one and one-to-many communication\n   sessions.\n   In single-level\
    \ End Systems, in the one-to-one mode, the SCTP session\n   state for a single\
    \ local SCTP session includes the set of remote IP\n   addresses for the single\
    \ remote SCTP instance, the set of local IP\n   addresses, the remote SCTP port\
    \ number, and the local SCTP port\n   number.\n   In single-level End Systems,\
    \ in the one-to-many mode, the SCTP\n   session state for a single local SCTP\
    \ instance can have multiple\n   concurrent connections to several different remote\
    \ SCTP peers.  There\n   cannot be more than one connection from a single SCTP\
    \ instance to any\n   given remote SCTP instance.  Thus, in single-level End Systems,\
    \ in\n   the one-to-many mode, the local SCTP session state includes the set\n\
    \   of remote IP addresses, the set of local IP addresses, the remote\n   SCTP\
    \ port number for each remote SCTP instance, and the (single)\n   local SCTP port\
    \ number.\n   In MLS End Systems, for either SCTP mode, the SCTP session state\n\
    \   additionally includes the Sensitivity Label for each SCTP session.  A\n  \
    \ single SCTP session, whether in the one-to-one mode or in the one-\n   to-many\
    \ mode, MUST have a single Sensitivity Label, rather than a\n   Sensitivity Label\
    \ range.\n   Unlike TCP, SCTP has the ability to shift an existing SCTP session\n\
    \   from one endpoint IP address to a different IP address that belongs\n   to\
    \ the same endpoint, when one or more endpoints have multiple IP\n   addresses.\
    \  If such shifting occurs within an MLS deployment, it is\n   important that\
    \ it only move to an IP address with a Sensitivity Label\n   range that includes\
    \ that SCTP session's own Sensitivity Label.\n   Further, although a node might\
    \ be multi-homed, it is entirely\n   possible that only one of those interfaces\
    \ is reachable for a given\n   Sensitivity Label value.  For example, one network\
    \ interface on a\n   node might have a Sensitivity Label range from \"A::\" to\
    \ \"B:XY\" (where\n   B dominates A), while a different network interface on the\
    \ same node\n   might have a Sensitivity Label range from \"U::\" \"U::\" (where\
    \ A\n   dominates U).  In that example, if a packet has a CALIPSO label of\n \
    \  \"A:X\", then that packet will not be able to use the \"U\"-only network\n\
    \   interface.  Hence, an SCTP implementation needs to consider the\n   Sensitivity\
    \ Label of each SCTP instance on the local system when\n   deciding which of its\
    \ own IP addresses to communicate to the remote\n   SCTP instance(s) for that\
    \ SCTP instance.  This issue might lead to\n   novel operational issues with SCTP\
    \ sessions.  Implementers ought to\n   give special attention to this SCTP-specific\
    \ issue.\n"

    \ explicit Sensitivity\n   Labels to IPv6 datagrams.  The primary purpose of these\
    \ labels is to\n   facilitate application of Mandatory Access Controls (MAC) in\
    \ End\n   Systems or Intermediate Systems that implement this specification.\n\
    \   As such, correct implementation of this mechanism is very critical to\n  \
    \ the overall security of the systems and networks where this\n   mechanisms is\
    \ deployed.  Use of high-assurance development techniques\n   is encouraged. \
    \ End users should carefully consider the assurance\n   requirements of their\
    \ particular deployment, in the context of that\n   deployment's prospective threats.\n\
    \   A concern is that since this label is used for Mandatory Access\n   Controls,\
    \ some method of binding the Sensitivity Label option to the\n   rest of the packet\
    \ is needed.  Without such binding, malicious\n   modification of the Sensitivity\
    \ Label in a packet would go\n   undetected.  So, implementations of this Sensitivity\
    \ Label option\n   MUST also implement support for the IP Authentication Header\
    \ (AH).\n   Implementations MUST permit the system administrator to configure\n\
    \   whether or not AH is used.\n   ESP with null encryption mechanism can only\
    \ protect the payload of an\n   IPv6 packet, not any Hop-by-Hop Options.  By contrast,\
    \ AH protects\n   all invariant headers and data of an IPv6 packet, including\
    \ the\n   CALIPSO Hop-by-Hop Option.  The CALIPSO option defined in this\n   document\
    \ is always an IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Option, because the CALIPSO\n   option needs to\
    \ be visible to, and parsable by, IPv6 routers and\n   security gateways so that\
    \ they can apply MAC policy to packets.\n   It is anticipated that if AH is being\
    \ used with a symmetric\n   authentication algorithm, then not only the recipient\
    \ End System, but\n   also one or more security gateways along the path, will\
    \ have\n   knowledge of the symmetric key -- so that AH can be used to\n   authenticate\
    \ the packet, including the CALIPSO label.  In this case,\n   all devices knowing\
    \ that symmetric authentication key would need to\n   be trusted.  Alternatively,\
    \ AH may be used with an asymmetric\n   authentication algorithm, so that the\
    \ recipient and any security\n   gateways with knowledge of the authentication\
    \ key can authenticate\n   the packet, including the CALIPSO label.\n   If AH\
    \ or ESP are employed to provide \"labeled IP Security\" within\n   some CALIPSO\
    \ deployment, then the Sensitivity Label of the IP\n   Security Association used\
    \ for a given packet MUST have the same\n   meaning as the Sensitivity Label carried\
    \ in the CALIPSO option of\n   that packet, in order that MAC policy can and will\
    \ be correctly\n   applied.\n   Because the IP Authentication Header will include\
    \ the CALIPSO option\n   among the protected IPv6 header fields, modification\
    \ of a CALIPSO-\n   labeled packet that also contains an IP Authentication Header\
    \ will\n   cause the resulting packet to fail authentication at the destination\n\
    \   node for the AH security session.  Therefore, CALIPSO labels cannot\n   be\
    \ inserted, deleted, or translated for IPv6 packets that contain an\n   IP Authentication\
    \ Header.\n   NOTE WELL: The \"not modified during transit\" bit for IPv6 option\n\
    \   types was really created to be the \"include in AH calculations\"\n   signal.\
    \  There was no other reason to define that bit in IPv6.\n   In situations where\
    \ a modification by an Intermediate System is\n   required by policy, but is not\
    \ possible due to AH, then the packet\n   MUST be dropped instead.  If the packet\
    \ must be dropped for this\n   reason, then an ICMP \"Destination Unreachable\"\
    \ error message SHOULD\n   be sent back to the originator of the dropped packet\
    \ with a reason\n   code of \"Administratively Prohibited\".  If the packet can\
    \ be\n   forwarded properly without violating the MLS MAC policy of the\n   Intermediate\
    \ System, then (by definition) such a packet modification\n   is not required.\n\
    \   Note that in a number of error situations with labeled networking, an\n  \
    \ ICMP error message MUST NOT be sent in order to avoid creating\n   security\
    \ problems.  In certain other error situations, an ICMP error\n   message might\
    \ be sent.  Such ICMP handling details have been\n   described earlier in this\
    \ document.  Even if an ICMP error message is\n   sent, it might be dropped along\
    \ the way before reaching its intended\n   destination -- due to MAC rules, DOI\
    \ differences, or other configured\n   security policies along the way from the\
    \ node creating the ICMP error\n   message to the intended destination node. \
    \ In turn, this can mean\n   operational faults (e.g., fibre cut, misconfiguration)\
    \ in a labeled\n   network deployment might be more difficult to identify and\
    \ resolve.\n   This mechanism is only intended for deployment in very limited\n\
    \   circumstances where a set of systems and networks are in a well-\n   protected\
    \ operating environment and the threat of external or\n   internal attack on this\
    \ mechanism is considered acceptable to the\n   accreditor of those systems and\
    \ networks.  IP packets containing\n   visible packet labels ought never traverse\
    \ the public Internet.\n   This specification does not seek to eliminate all possible\
    \ covert\n   channels.  The TCP specification clarification in Section 7.3.1\n\
    \   happens to reduce the bandwidth of a particular known covert channel,\n  \
    \ but is present primarily to clarify how networked MLS systems have\n   always\
    \ been implemented [TNI] [MLOSPP].\n   Of course, subject to local security policies,\
    \ encrypted IPv6 packets\n   with CALIPSO labels might well traverse the public\
    \ Internet after\n   receiving suitable cryptographic protection.  For example,\
    \ a\n   CALIPSO-labeled packet might travel either through a Tunnel-mode ESP\n\
    \   (with encryption) VPN tunnel that connects two or more MLS-labeled\n   network\
    \ segments.  Alternatively, a CALIPSO-labeled IPv6 packet might\n   travel over\
    \ some external link that has been protected by the\n   deployment of evaluated,\
    \ certified, and accredited bulk encryptors\n   that would encrypt the labeled\
    \ packet before transmission onto the\n   link and decrypt the labeled packet\
    \ after reception from the link.\n   Accreditors of a given CALIPSO deployment\
    \ should consider not only\n   personnel clearances and physical security issues,\
    \ but also\n   electronic security (e.g., TEMPEST), network security (NETSEC),\n\
    \   communications security (COMSEC), and other issues.  This\n   specification\
    \ is only a small component of an overall MLS network\n   deployment.\n"
