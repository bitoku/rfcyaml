    - "4.1.  Using AAA services with SNMP\n   There are two use cases for AAA support
      of management access via\n   SNMP.  These are (a) service authorization and
      (b) access control\n   authorization.  The former is discussed in detail in
      [RFC5608].  The\n   latter is the subject of this memo.\n   The use case assumption
      here is that roles within an organization\n   (which are represented in VACM
      as groups, which in turn name access\n   control policies) change infrequently,
      while the users assigned to\n   those roles change much more frequently.  This
      memo describes how the\n   user-to-role (group) mapping can be delegated to
      the RADIUS server,\n   avoiding the need to re-provision managed devices as
      users are added,\n   deleted, or assigned new roles in an organization.\n   This
      memo assumes that the detailed access control policies are pre-\n   configured
      in VACM, and does not attempt to address the question of\n   how the policy
      associated with a given role is put in place.\n   The only additional information
      obtained from the AAA service is the\n   mapping of the authenticated user's
      identifier to a specific role (or\n   \"group\" in VACM terminology) in the
      access control policy.  Dynamic\n   user authorization for MIB database access
      control, as defined\n   herein, is limited to mapping the authenticated user
      to a group,\n   which in turn is mapped to whatever access control policies
      are\n   already in place in VACM.\n   The SNMP architecture [RFC3411] maintains
      strong modularity and\n   separation of concerns, separating user identity (authentication)\n
      \  from user database access rights (authorization).  RADIUS, on the\n   other
      hand, allows for no such separation of authorization from\n   authentication.
      \ Consequently, the approach here is to leverage\n   existing RADIUS usage for
      identifying a principal, documented in\n   [RFC5608], along with the RADIUS
      Management-Policy-Id Attribute\n   [RFC5607].\n   A unique identifier is needed
      for each AAA-authorized \"session\",\n   corresponding to a communication channel,
      such as a transport\n   session, for which a principal has been AAA-authenticated
      and which\n   is authorized to offer SNMP service.  How these identifiers are\n
      \  assigned is implementation dependent.  When a RADIUS Management-\n   Policy-Id
      Attribute (or equivalent) is bound to such a session and\n   principal authentication,
      this binding provides sufficient\n   information to compute dynamic updates
      to VACM.  How this information\n   is communicated within an implementation
      is implementation dependent;\n   this memo is only concerned with externally
      observable behavior.\n   The key concept here is that what we will informally
      call a \"AAA\n   binding\" binds:\n   1.  a communications channel\n   2.  an
      authenticated principal\n   3.  service authorization\n   4.  an access control
      policy name\n   Some of the binding is done via other specifications.  A transport\n
      \  model, such as the Secure Shell Transport Model [RFC5592], provides a\n   binding
      between 1 and 2 and 3, providing a securityName.  In turn,\n   [RFC5607] provides
      a binding between (1+2+3) and 4.  This document\n   extends that further, to
      create a binding between (1+2+3+4) and the\n   local (VACM MIB) definition of
      the named policy, called a group in\n   VACM.\n"

      specific\n   Transport Models, such as the Secure Shell Transport Model [RFC5592],\n
      \  it MAY be used with other implementation environments satisfying\n   these
      requirements:\n   o  use an AAA service for sign-on service and data access\n
      \     authorization;\n   o  provide an indication of the start of a session
      for a particular\n      authenticated principal in a particular role, based
      on information\n      provided by the AAA service.  The principal will be identified\n
      \     using an SNMP securityName [RFC3411].  The role will be identified\n      by
      the name of the corresponding VACM group.\n   o  provide an indication of the
      end of the need for being able to\n      make access decisions for a particular
      authenticated principal, as\n      at the end of a session, whether due to disconnection,
      termination\n      due to timeout, or any other reason.\n   Likewise, although
      this memo specifically refers to RADIUS, it MAY be\n   used with other AAA services
      satisfying these requirements:\n   o  the service provides information semantically
      equivalent to the\n      RADIUS Management-Policy-Id Attribute [RFC5607], which
      corresponds\n      to the name of a VACM group;\n   o  the service provides
      an authenticated principal identifier (e.g.,\n      the RADIUS User-Name Attribute
      [RFC2865]) that can be transformed\n      to an equivalent principal identifier

      \  RADIUS Management-Policy-Id [RFC5607] Attribute (or its equivalent)\n   from
      the RADIUS Access-Accept message (or equivalent).  They also\n   assume that
      the User-Name [RFC2865] from the RADIUS Access-Request\n   message (or equivalent)
      corresponds to a securityName [RFC3411].\n   To ensure correct processing of
      SNMP PDUs, the handling of the\n   indication of the establishment of a session
      in accordance with the\n   elements of procedure below MUST be completed before

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   The algorithms in this memo make heuristic use
    of the StorageType of\n   entries in the vacmSecurityToGroupTable to distinguish
    those\n   provisioned by a security administrator (which would presumably not\n
    \  be configured as \"volatile\") from those dynamically generated.  In\n   making
    this distinction, it assumes that those entries explicitly\n   provisioned by
    a security administrator and given a non-\"volatile\"\n   status are not to be
    dynamically overridden.  Furthermore, it assumes\n   that any active entries with
    \"volatile\" status can be treated as\n   dynamic, and deleted or updated as needed.
    \ Users of this memo need\n   to be aware of this operational assumption, which,
    while reasonable,\n   is not necessarily universally valid.  For example, this
    situation\n   could also occur if the SNMP security administrator had mistakenly\n
    \  created these non-volatile entries in error.\n   The design of VACM ensures
    that if an unknown policy (group name) is\n   used in the vacmSecurityToGroupTable,
    no access is granted.  A\n   consequence of this is that no matter what information
    is provided by\n   the AAA server, no user can gain SNMP access rights not already\n
    \  granted to some group through the VACM configuration.\n"
  - contents:
    - "9.1.  Principal Identity Naming\n   In order to ensure that the access control
      policy ultimately applied\n   as a result of the mechanisms described here is
      indeed the intended\n   policy for a given principal using a particular security
      model, care\n   needs to be applied in the mapping of the authenticated user\n
      \  (principal) identity to the securityName used to make the access\n   control
      decision.  Broadly speaking, there are two approaches to\n   ensure consistency
      of identity:\n   o  Entries for the vacmSecurityToGroupTable corresponding to
      a given\n      security model are created only through the operation of the\n
      \     procedures described in this memo.  A consequence of this would be\n      that
      all such entries would have been created using the RADIUS\n      User-Name (or
      other AAA-authenticated identity) and RADIUS\n      Management-Policy-Id Attribute
      (or equivalent).\n   o  Administrative policy allows a matching pre-configured
      entry to\n      exist in the vacmSecurityToGroupTable, i.e., an entry with the\n
      \     corresponding vacmSecurityModel and with a vacmSecurityName\n      matching
      the authenticated principal's RADIUS User-Name.  In this\n      case, administrative
      policy also needs to ensure consistency of\n      identity between each authenticated
      principal's RADIUS User-Name\n      and the administratively configured vacmSecurityName
      in the\n      vacmSecurityToGroupTable row entries for that particular security\n
      \     model.\n   In the latter case, inconsistent re-use of the same name for\n
      \  different entities or individuals (principals) can cause the\n   incorrect
      access control policy to be applied for the authenticated\n   principal, depending
      on whether the policy that is configured using\n   SNMP or the policy that is
      applied using the procedures of this memo\n   is the intended policy.  This
      may result in greater or lesser access\n   rights than the administrative policy
      intended.  Inadvertent\n   misidentification in such cases may be undetectable
      by the SNMP\n   engine or other software elements of the managed entity.\n"

    - "9.2.  Management Information Considerations\n   There are no management objects
      defined in this MIB module that have\n   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or
      read-create.  So, if this\n   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there
      is no risk that an\n   intruder can alter or create any management objects of
      this MIB\n   module via direct SNMP SET operations.\n   Some of the readable
      objects in this MIB module (including some\n   objects with a MAX-ACCESS of
      not-accessible, whose values are exposed\n   as a result of access to indexed
      objects) may be considered sensitive\n   or vulnerable in some network environments.
      \ It is thus important to\n   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these
      objects and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending
      them over\n   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their\n
      \  sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   o  vacmAaaSecurityToGroupTable - the entire
      table is potentially\n      sensitive, since walking the table will reveal user
      names,\n      security models in use, session identifiers, and group names;\n
      \  o  vacmAaaSecurityModel - though not-accessible, this is exposed as\n      an
      index of vacmAaaGroupName;\n   o  vacmAaaSecurityName - though not-accessible,
      this is exposed as an\n      index of vacmAaaGroupName;\n   o  vacmAaaSessionID
      - though not-accessible, this is exposed as an\n      index of vacmAaaGroupName;\n
      \  o  vacmAaaGroupName - since this identifies a security policy and\n      associates
      it with a particular user, this is potentially\n      sensitive.\n   SNMP versions
      prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself
      is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n   even then, there is no control as
      to who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)
      the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers
      consider the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see
      [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic
      mechanisms (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of
      SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED
      to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n
      \  responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance
      of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects
      only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET
      or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"
