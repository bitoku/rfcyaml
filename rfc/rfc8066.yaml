- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Section 5.1 of [RFC4944] defines the dispatch header and\
    \ types.  The\n   ESC type is defined to use additional dispatch octets in the\
    \ 6LoWPAN\n   header.  RFC 6282 modifies the value of the ESC dispatch type and\n\
    \   that value is recorded in IANA registry [IANA-6LoWPAN].  However, the\n  \
    \ octets and usage following the ESC dispatch type are not defined in\n   either\
    \ [RFC4944] or [RFC6282].  In recent years with 6LoWPAN\n   deployments, implementations\
    \ and standards organizations have started\n   using the ESC extension octets.\
    \  This highlights the need for an\n   updated IANA registration policy.\n   This\
    \ document defines the new \"ESC Extension Types\" registry and the\n   ESC extension\
    \ octets for future applications.  In addition, this\n   document records the\
    \ ITU-T specification for ESC dispatch octet code\n   points as an existing known\
    \ usage.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Usage of ESC Dispatch Octets\n   RFC 4944 [RFC4944] first introduces this\
    \ \"ESC\" dispatch header type\n   for extension of dispatch octets.  RFC 6282\
    \ [RFC6282] subsequently\n   modified its value to [01 000000].\n   This document\
    \ specifies that the first octet following the ESC\n   dispatch type be used for\
    \ extension type (extended dispatch values).\n   Subsequent octets are left unstructured\
    \ for the specific use of the\n   extension type:\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\
    \ 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \   |     ESC       | ESC EXT Type  | Extended Dispatch Payload\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \               Figure 1: Frame Format with ESC Dispatch Type\n   ESC: The left-most\
    \ octet is the ESC dispatch type containing\n   '01000000'.\n   ESC Extension\
    \ Type (EET): It is the first octet following the ESC\n   dispatch type.  Extension\
    \ type defines the payload for the additional\n   dispatch octets.  The values\
    \ are from 0 to 255.  Values 0 and 255 are\n   reserved for future use.  The remaining\
    \ values from 1 to 254 are\n   assigned by IANA.  The EET values are similar to\
    \ dispatch values in\n   the 6LoWPAN header except they are preceded by the ESC\
    \ dispatch type.\n   Thus, ESC extension types and dispatch values are using orthogonal\n\
    \   code spaces.  Though not desirable, multiple ESC dispatch types MAY\n   appear\
    \ in a 6LoWPAN header.  Section 3.1 describes how to handle an\n   unknown ESC\
    \ dispatch type.\n   Extended Dispatch Payload (EDP): This part of the frame format\
    \ must\n   be defined by the corresponding extension type.  A specification is\n\
    \   required to define the usage of each extension type and its\n   corresponding\
    \ Extension Payload.  For the sake of interoperability,\n   specifications of\
    \ extension octets MUST NOT redefine the existing ESC\n   Extension Type codes.\n\
    \   Section 5.1 of RFC 4944 indicates that the Extension Type field may\n   contain\
    \ additional dispatch values larger than 63, as corrected by\n   [Err4359].  For\
    \ the sake of interoperability, the new dispatch type\n   (EET) MUST NOT modify\
    \ the behavior of existing dispatch types\n   [RFC4944].\n"
- title: 3.1.  Interaction with Other RFC 4944 Implementations
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Interaction with Other RFC 4944 Implementations\n   It is expected that\
    \ existing implementations of RFC 4944 are not\n   capable of processing ESC extension\
    \ data octets as defined in this\n   document.  However, implementers have to\
    \ assume that an existing\n   implementation that attempts to process an EET that\
    \ is unknown to\n   them will simply drop the packet or ignore the ESC dispatch\
    \ octets.\n   If an implementation following this document, during processing\
    \ of\n   the received packet, reaches an ESC dispatch type for which it does\n\
    \   not understand the ESC Extension Type (EET) octets, it MUST drop that\n  \
    \ packet.  However, it is important to clarify that a router node\n   SHOULD forward\
    \ a 6LoWPAN packet with the EET octets as long as it\n   does not attempt to process\
    \ any unknown ESC extension octets.\n   Multiple ESC extension octets may appear\
    \ in a packet.  The ESC\n   dispatch types can appear as the first, last, or middle\
    \ dispatch\n   octets.  However, a packet will get dropped by any node that does\
    \ not\n   understand the EET at the beginning of the packet.  Placing an EET\n\
    \   toward the front of the packet has a greater probability of causing\n   the\
    \ packet to be dropped than placing the same EET later in the\n   packet.  Placement\
    \ of an EET later in the packet increases the chance\n   that a legacy device\
    \ will recognize and successfully process some\n   dispatch type [RFC4944]  before\
    \ the EET.  In this case, the legacy\n   device will ignore the EET instead of\
    \ dropping the entire packet.\n"

    \ of\n   non-6LoWPAN payloads.  Since ESC dispatch types are part of 6LoWPAN\n\
    \   dispatch types (extended), they are orthogonal to NALP octets.\n   This document\
    \ clarifies that NALP dispatch codes only provide an\n   escape method for non-6LoWPAN\
    \ payloads when they appear as the\n   initial octet of a LoWPAN encapsulation,\
