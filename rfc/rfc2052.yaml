- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a DNS RR which specifies the location of\
    \ the\n   server(s) for a specific protocol and domain (like a more general\n\
    \   form of MX).\n"
- title: Overview and rationale
  contents:
  - "Overview and rationale\n   Currently, one must either know the exact address\
    \ of a server to\n   contact it, or broadcast a question.  This has led to, for\
    \ example,\n   ftp.whatever.com aliases, the SMTP-specific MX RR, and using MAC-\n\
    \   level broadcasts to locate servers.\n   The SRV RR allows administrators to\
    \ use several servers for a single\n   domain, to move services from host to host\
    \ with little fuss, and to\n   designate some hosts as primary servers for a service\
    \ and others as\n   backups.\n   Clients ask for a specific service/protocol for\
    \ a specific domain\n   (the word domain is used here in the strict RFC 1034 sense),\
    \ and get\n   back the names of any available servers.\n"
- title: Introductory example
  contents:
  - "Introductory example\n   When a SRV-cognizant web-browser wants to retrieve\n\
    \      http://www.asdf.com/\n   it does a lookup of\n      http.tcp.www.asdf.com\n\
    \   and retrieves the document from one of the servers in the reply.  The\n  \
    \ example zone file near the end of the memo contains answering RRs for\n   this\
    \ query.\n"
- title: The format of the SRV RR
  contents:
  - "The format of the SRV RR\n   Here is the format of the SRV RR, whose DNS type\
    \ code is 33:\n        Service.Proto.Name TTL Class SRV Priority Weight Port Target\n\
    \        (There is an example near the end of this document.)\n   Service\n  \
    \      The symbolic name of the desired service, as defined in Assigned\n    \
    \    Numbers or locally.\n        Some widely used services, notably POP, don't\
    \ have a single\n        universal name.  If Assigned Numbers names the service\n\
    \        indicated, that name is the only name which is legal for SRV\n      \
    \  lookups.  Only locally defined services may be named locally.\n        The\
    \ Service is case insensitive.\n   Proto\n        TCP and UDP are at present the\
    \ most useful values\n        for this field, though any name defined by Assigned\
    \ Numbers or\n        locally may be used (as for Service).  The Proto is case\n\
    \        insensitive.\n   Name\n        The domain this RR refers to.  The SRV\
    \ RR is unique in that the\n        name one searches for is not this name; the\
    \ example near the end\n        shows this clearly.\n   TTL\n        Standard\
    \ DNS meaning.\n   Class\n        Standard DNS meaning.\n   Priority\n       \
    \ As for MX, the priority of this target host.  A client MUST\n        attempt\
    \ to contact the target host with the lowest-numbered\n        priority it can\
    \ reach; target hosts with the same priority\n        SHOULD be tried in pseudorandom\
    \ order.  The range is 0-65535.\n   Weight\n        Load balancing mechanism.\
    \  When selecting a target host among\n        the those that have the same priority,\
    \ the chance of trying this\n        one first SHOULD be proportional to its weight.\
    \  The range of\n        this number is 1-65535.  Domain administrators are urged\
    \ to use\n        Weight 0 when there isn't any load balancing to do, to make\
    \ the\n        RR easier to read for humans (less noisy).\n   Port\n        The\
    \ port on this target host of this service.  The range is\n        0-65535.  This\
    \ is often as specified in Assigned Numbers but\n        need not be.\n   Target\n\
    \        As for MX, the domain name of the target host.  There MUST be\n     \
    \   one or more A records for this name. Implementors are urged, but\n       \
    \ not required, to return the A record(s) in the Additional Data\n        section.\
    \  Name compression is to be used for this field.\n        A Target of \".\" means\
    \ that the service is decidedly not\n        available at this domain.\n"
- title: Domain administrator advice
  contents:
  - "Domain administrator advice\n   Asking everyone to update their telnet (for example)\
    \ clients when the\n   first internet site adds a SRV RR for Telnet/TCP is futile\
    \ (even if\n   desirable).  Therefore SRV will have to coexist with A record lookups\n\
    \   for a long time, and DNS administrators should try to provide A\n   records\
    \ to support old clients:\n      - Where the services for a single domain are\
    \ spread over several\n        hosts, it seems advisable to have a list of A RRs\
    \ at the same\n        DNS node as the SRV RR, listing reasonable (if perhaps\n\
    \        suboptimal) fallback hosts for Telnet, NNTP and other protocols\n   \
    \     likely to be used with this name.  Note that some programs only\n      \
    \  try the first address they get back from e.g. gethostbyname(),\n        and\
    \ we don't know how widespread this behaviour is.\n      - Where one service is\
    \ provided by several hosts, one can either\n        provide A records for all\
    \ the hosts (in which case the round-\n        robin mechanism, where available,\
    \ will share the load equally)\n        or just for one (presumably the fastest).\n\
    \      - If a host is intended to provide a service only when the main\n     \
    \   server(s) is/are down, it probably shouldn't be listed in A\n        records.\n\
    \      - Hosts that are referenced by backup A records must use the port\n   \
    \     number specified in Assigned Numbers for the service.\n   Currently there's\
    \ a practical limit of 512 bytes for DNS replies.\n   Until all resolvers can\
    \ handle larger responses, domain\n   administrators are strongly advised to keep\
    \ their SRV replies below\n   512 bytes.\n   All round numbers, wrote Dr. Johnson,\
    \ are false, and these numbers\n   are very round: A reply packet has a 30-byte\
    \ overhead plus the name\n   of the service (\"telnet.tcp.asdf.com\" for instance);\
    \ each SRV RR adds\n   20 bytes plus the name of the target host; each NS RR in\
    \ the NS\n   section is 15 bytes plus the name of the name server host; and\n\
    \   finally each A RR in the additional data section is 20 bytes or so,\n   and\
    \ there are A's for each SRV and NS RR mentioned in the answer.\n   This size\
    \ estimate is extremely crude, but shouldn't underestimate\n   the actual answer\
    \ size by much.  If an answer may be close to the\n   limit, using e.g. \"dig\"\
    \ to look at the actual answer is a good idea.\n"
- title: The "Weight" field
  contents:
  - "The \"Weight\" field\n   Weight, the load balancing field, is not quite satisfactory,\
    \ but the\n   actual load on typical servers changes much too quickly to be kept\n\
    \   around in DNS caches.  It seems to the authors that offering\n   administrators\
    \ a way to say \"this machine is three times as fast as\n   that one\" is the\
    \ best that can practically be done.\n   The only way the authors can see of getting\
    \ a \"better\" load figure is\n   asking a separate server when the client selects\
    \ a server and\n   contacts it.  For short-lived services like SMTP an extra step\
    \ in the\n   connection establishment seems too expensive, and for long-lived\n\
    \   services like telnet, the load figure may well be thrown off a minute\n  \
    \ after the connection is established when someone else starts or\n   finishes\
    \ a heavy job.\n"
- title: The Port number
  contents:
  - "The Port number\n   Currently, the translation from service name to port number\
    \ happens\n   at the client, often using a file such as /etc/services.\n   Moving\
    \ this information to the DNS makes it less necessary to update\n   these files\
    \ on every single computer of the net every time a new\n   service is added, and\
    \ makes it possible to move standard services out\n   of the \"root-only\" port\
    \ range on unix.\n"
- title: Usage rules
  contents:
  - "Usage rules\n   A SRV-cognizant client SHOULD use this procedure to locate a\
    \ list of\n   servers and connect to the preferred one:\n        Do a lookup for\
    \ QNAME=service.protocol.target, QCLASS=IN,\n        QTYPE=SRV.\n        If the\
    \ reply is NOERROR, ANCOUNT>0 and there is at least one SRV\n        RR which\
    \ specifies the requested Service and Protocol in the\n        reply:\n      \
    \       If there is precisely one SRV RR, and its Target is \".\"\n          \
    \   (the root domain), abort.\n             Else, for all such RR's, build a list\
    \ of (Priority, Weight,\n             Target) tuples\n             Sort the list\
    \ by priority (lowest number first)\n             Create a new empty list\n  \
    \           For each distinct priority level\n                  While there are\
    \ still elements left at this priority\n                  level\n            \
    \           Select an element randomly, with probability\n                   \
    \    Weight, and move it to the tail of the new list\n             For each element\
    \ in the new list\n                  query the DNS for A RR's for the Target or\
    \ use any\n                  RR's found in the Additional Data secion of the\n\
    \                  earlier SRV query.\n                  for each A RR found,\
    \ try to connect to the (protocol,\n                  address, service).\n   \
    \     else if the service desired is SMTP\n             skip to RFC 974 (MX).\n\
    \        else\n             Do a lookup for QNAME=target, QCLASS=IN, QTYPE=A\n\
    \             for each A RR found, try to connect to the (protocol,\n        \
    \     address, service)\n   Notes:\n      - Port numbers SHOULD NOT be used in\
    \ place of the symbolic service\n        or protocol names (for the same reason\
    \ why variant names cannot\n        be allowed: Applications would have to do\
    \ two or more lookups).\n      - If a truncated response comes back from an SRV\
    \ query, and the\n        Additional Data section has at least one complete RR\
    \ in it, the\n        answer MUST be considered complete and the client resolver\n\
    \        SHOULD NOT retry the query using TCP, but use normal UDP queries\n  \
    \      for A RR's missing from the Additional Data section.\n      - A client\
    \ MAY use means other than Weight to choose among target\n        hosts with equal\
    \ Priority.\n      - A client MUST parse all of the RR's in the reply.\n     \
    \ - If the Additional Data section doesn't contain A RR's for all\n        the\
    \ SRV RR's and the client may want to connect to the target\n        host(s) involved,\
    \ the client MUST look up the A RR(s).  (This\n        happens quite often when\
    \ the A RR has shorter TTL than the SRV\n        or NS RR's.)\n      - A future\
    \ standard could specify that a SRV RR whose Protocol was\n        TCP and whose\
    \ Service was SMTP would override RFC 974's rules\n        with regard to the\
    \ use of an MX RR.  This would allow firewalled\n        organizations with several\
    \ SMTP relays to control the load\n        distribution using the Weight field.\n\
    \      - Future protocols could be designed to use SRV RR lookups as the\n   \
    \     means by which clients locate their servers.\n"

  - "Security Considerations\n   The authors believes this RR to not cause any new\
    \ security problems.\n   Some problems become more visible, though.\n      - The\
    \ ability to specify ports on a fine-grained basis obviously\n        changes\
    \ how a router can filter packets.  It becomes impossible\n        to block internal\
    \ clients from accessing specific external\n        services, slightly harder\
    \ to block internal users from running\n        unautorised services, and more\
    \ important for the router\n        operations and DNS operations personnel to\
    \ cooperate.\n      - There is no way a site can keep its hosts from being referenced\n\
