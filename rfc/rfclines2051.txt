This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines objects for managing the configuration, monitoring and controlling of network devices with APPC (Advanced Program to Program Communications) capabilities.
This memo identifies managed objects for the SNA LU6.2 protocols.
The SNMP Network Management Framework
The SNMP Network Management Framework consists of several components.
For the purpose of this specification, the applicable components of the Framework are the SMI and related documents [2, 3, 4], which define the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
This document identifies the proposed set of objects for managing the configuration, monitoring and controlling devices with APPC capabilities.
APPC is the aspect of SNA which supports peer to peer communication, and provides the interface for applications to communicate.
In this document, we will describe LU6.2 protocol  specific managed objects.
This document describes both dependent and independent LU 6.2 protocols.
A dependent LU requires assistance from an SSCP in order to activate an LU 6.2 session.
An independent LU is able to activate an LU 6.2 session without assistance from the SSCP.
If the agent supports dependent LU 6.2 only, the SNA NAU MIB, RFC 1666
[7] is used instead to represent those objects.
Local LUs and partner LUs connect with each other using sessions.
Multiple different sessions can be established between LUs with characteristics defined by Modes.
Session limits within a defined Mode are negotiated between the local and partner LUs using a protocol called CNOS (Change Number of Sessions).
Transaction Programs (TPs) are applications that use sessions to communicate with each other.
Multiple TPs can use the same session, but not at the same time.
A single usage of a session is called a conversation.
While a session can stay active for a long time, a conversation can come up and down based on usage by the TPs.
Common Programming Interface Communications (CPI C) is a standard API (Application Programming Interface) for APPC and OSI TP that is used by TPs for accessing conversations.
Although, many of the CPI C objects in this MIB are relevant to both APPC and OSI TP, the intention is for managing APPC products only.
SNA names such as LU names, CP names, mode names, and COS names can be padded with space characters in SNA formats.
These space characters are insignificant.
For example, in a BIND RU a mode name of "#INTER" with a length of 6 is identical to a mode name of "#INTER " with a length of 8.
However, in this MIB, insignificant space characters are not included by the agent.
Using the mode name from the previous example, an agent would return a length of 6 and the string "#INTER" with no space characters for appcModeAdminModeName, regardless of how it appears in the BIND RU or in internal storage.
When an SNA name is functioning as a table index, an agent shall treat trailing space characters as significant.
If a Management Station requests the objects from a row with index "
, the agent does not match this to the row with index "#INTER".
Since an agent has no insignificant space characters in any of its table indices, the only reason for a Management Station to include them would be to start GetNext processing at a chosen point in a table.
Issuing CNOS processing verbs/commands for INITIALIZE SESSION LIMIT, CHANGE SESSION LIMIT and RESET SESSION LIMIT.
Monitoring of parameters related to local LU, partner LU, modes, TPs and CPI C side information.
Monitoring of LU6.2 specific session operational parameters and statistics, historical information about abnormally terminated sessions, and information about APPC sessions that are transported by APPN HPR.
Monitoring of conversation operational parameters, and historical information about abnormally terminated sessions.
Creating and deleting partner LUs, modes, TPs, and CPI C side information tables.
Modifying parameters related to local LU, partner LU, modes, TPs, and CPI C side information.
Activating or deactivating local LUs.
Activating or deactivating partner LUs.
Activating or deactivating Transaction Programs.
In addition, CNOS processing objects are also part of this group.
appcLu   objects related to LU6.2 specific local and partner LU, mode definition, monitoring and control.
appcTp  objects related to transaction program definition, monitoring and control.
appcSession  objects related to LU6.2 specific session monitoring.
appcConversation  objects related to conversation monitoring.
appcCPIC  objects related to related CPI C side information.
These groups are described below in more detail.
The objects related to LU6.2 are generally organized into two types of tables: the Admin and Oper tables.
The "Admin" table contains read only objects which contain default or expected configuration values.
This MIB does not create or modify configuration values.
The "Oper" table contains objects which provide current operational values, such as state values or negotiated parameters, for dynamic or configured objects.
Dynamic objects are created by the APPC system using one of the templates provided in the "Admin" table.
Configured objects usually have a one to one relationship between "Admin" and "Oper" entries.
However, some "Admin" values may have changed since the object became operational, such that the "Oper" values may no longer be based on the "Admin" values.
The "Admin" entry could even be deleted.
For example, some implementations may allow a mode definition (appcModeAdminEntry) to be deleted even while an active session was using this mode (appcModeOperEntry still exists).
Where appropriate, the "Oper" table may include initial starting values for objects that can be reconfigured while operational.
How the "Admin" values are changed or deleted is outside the scope of this MIB.
The appcGlobal group consists of the following tables and objects: 1)
appcCntrlAdminGroup This group of objects controls whether certain statistics and counters (e.g., session counters and RSCV collection) should be maintained by the Agent.
In addition, the ability to activate and deactivate tracing is also supported through objects in this group.
These objects are for Agent implementations that wish to provide this level of operational control and are optional.
The objects in this group represent the desired state, with the actual operational values in appcCntlOperGroup.
These objects can be generated initially, after startup of SNA service, by the Agent which uses information from the Node configuration file.
Subsequent modifications of object values is possible by a Management station.
The modifications to these objects can be saved in the Node configuration file for the next startup (i.e., restart or next initialization) of SNA service, but the mechanism for this function is not defined in this document.
This group of objects monitors whether certain statistics and counters (e.g., session counters and RSCV collection ) are maintained by an Agent.
In addition, the ability to monitor tracing activity is also supported through objects in this group.
This table represents the actual operational state.
These states can be modified via objects in the appcCntrlAdminGroup.
appcGlobalObjects These objects describe global information such as APPC system start time, the control point name, and default LU 6.2 configuration values.
The type of default configuration information includes mode name, LU, and maximum logical record size.
These objects allows for issuing of CNOS commands relative to a local and partner LU pair and a Mode.
They support the following CNOS commands:  INITIALIZE SESSION LIMIT, CHANGE SESSION LIMIT and RESET SESSION LIMIT.
The objects in this group can be modified by a Management Station.
This group consists of objects that are relevant to the CNOS commands parameters, which a Management Station needs to set.
After setting the parameters of a CNOS command, the Management Station will set the control object (appcCnosCommand) to request the Agent to issue the appropriate CNOS command.
appcLu group The appcLu group consists of the following tables: 1) appcLluAdminTable
This table contains objects which describe specific LU6.2 local LU configuration information.
The type of information includes the maximum number of sessions supported and compression parameters.
This table contains objects which describe specific LU6.2 local LU operational information.
The type of information includes the maximum number of sessions supported, the number of sessions currently active, and compression parameters.
This table contains objects which describe local LU and partner LU configuration information.
The type of information includes security information and whether parallel sessions are supported.
For those implementations that have partner LU definitions associated with each local LU, multiple entries with the same appcLuPairAdminParLuName could exist with different appcLuPairAdminLocLuName.
For those implementations in which partner LU definitions apply to all local LUs, the appcLuPairAdminLocLuName is set to ' ALL'.
This table contains objects which describe partner/local LU pair run  time operational information.
The type of information includes security information and whether parallel sessions are supported.
Although the Admin (appcLuPairAdminTable) table entries could be global to all local LUs in a Node, an entry in this Oper table is always associated with one local LU.
A row in this table is created as soon as there is an active session between the local and partner LU.
Two entries are present when both LUs in a pair are local.
This table contains objects which describe Mode configuration information.
The type of information includes the mode name and maximum session limit.
For those implementations that have Mode definitions associated with each local and partner LU pair, multiple entries with the same appcModeAdminModeName could exist with different appcModeAdminLocLuName and appcModeAdminParLuName.
For those implementations in which Mode definitions apply to all local and/or all partner LUs, the appcModeAdminLocLuName and/or appcModeAdminParLuName are set to ' ALL'.
This table contains objects which describe Mode run time operational information for each local/partner LU pair.
The type of information includes the mode name and maximum session limit.
Although the Admin table entries could be global to all local and partner LUs in a Node, the Oper table entries are always associated with one local and partner LU pair.
A row in this table is created as soon as there is an active session between local and partner LU for this Mode.
Two entries are present when both LUs in a pair are local.
appcTp group The appcTp group consists of the following table: 1) appcTpAdminTable
This table contains objects which describe transaction program (TP) configuration information.
The type of information includes the TP name and TP operation, indicating how the TP will be started.
For those implementations that have TP definitions associated with each local LU, multiple entries with the same appcTpAdminTpName could exist with different appcTpAdminLocLuName.
For those implementations in which TP definition applies to all local LUs, it will have appcTpAdminLocLuName set to ' ALL'.
Run time information about TP tends to be product specific (e.g., process Id), and much of the information can be derived from the conversation tables.
appcSession group The appcSession group consists of the following tables: 1) appcActSessTable
This table contains objects which describe LU6.2 session information.
The type of information includes the PCID and the pacing counts.
This table contains statistical information about LU 6.2 sessions.
The type of information includes counters of bytes and RUs sent and received.
This table contains historical information about APPC sessions that have terminated abnormally.
The type of information includes the unbind type and sense data.
This table contains information about LU 6.2 sesions that are being transported by High Performance Routing.
The type of information includes the NCEID and TCID.
The appcConversation group consists of the following tables: 1) appcActiveConvTable
This table contains objects which describe active conversation information.
The type of information includes the state and type.
An entry is created by an Agent when the conversation is started, and is removed when the conversation ends.
This table contains objects which describe historical conversation information about abnormally terminated conversations.
The number of entries and how long they are kept depends on the Agent implementation.
The type of information inclues the sense data and log data.
The appcCPIC group consists of the following tables:
This table contains objects which describe CPI C side information.
The type of information includes the symbolic destination name and partner LU name.
For those implementations that have CPI C definition associated with each local LU, multiple entries with the same appcCpicAdminSymbDestName could exist with different appcCpicAdminLocLuName.
For those implementations in which CPI C definition applies to all local LUs, it will have appcCpicAdminLocLuName set to ' ALL'.
This table contains objects which describe CPI C run time operational information.
The type of information includes the symbolic destination name and partner LU name.
