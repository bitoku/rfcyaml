  - "INTRODUCTION\n   There is a growing interest in moving toward more resource sharing\
    \ on\n   the ARPANET.  Some resource sharing has been taking place by having\n\
    \   systems open TELNET connections and generating user command strings.\n   I\
    \ think that this is fine for experimental use, but is not the way we\n   want\
    \ to operate in real usage.  What I believe network system\n   builders should\
    \ do is to develop mechanisms appropriately designed\n   for computer-computer\
    \ communication.\n"
- title: SYSTEM INTERCONNECTION, AN APPROACH
  contents:
  - "SYSTEM INTERCONNECTION, AN APPROACH\n   The goal I would like to see us move\
    \ toward is to view all systems on\n   the network as offering certain service\
    \ modules, any subset of which\n   can be combined in building other systems.\
    \  Each service module would\n   have a well advertised set of primitive service\
    \ capabilities that it\n   could provide.  It would have documented commands at\
    \ the level of\n   present Telnet or FTP commands for gaining access to its services.\n\
    \   It would also have a defined network connection procedure.  Then any\n   system\
    \ builder wanting to avail himself of these services could do so\n   and integrate\
    \ them into his own user interface environment.\n   At the present time when a\
    \ system is built, the system builders tend\n   to see it as a stand alone thing\
    \ or at most something to be used\n   within a specific environment.  What I would\
    \ like to see fostered is\n   the idea that any system built is not only a stand\
    \ alone environment\n   but also a network service or set of services.  The builders\
    \ would\n   define not only a user interface for their environment, but also a\n\
    \   set of primitives and primitive commands that can be accessed by\n   other\
    \ systems around the network to get that service performed.\n      For example,\
    \ we are redesigning the NLS Journal in light of our\n      experience and that\
    \ of Network Mail as a set of protocols and\n      services.  If one looks at\
    \ the processes of the NLS Journal one\n      can see a number of separate services\
    \ that could be provided by\n      different network sites or combined in varying\
    \ combinations by a\n      single site.  These being:\n         Distribution (identification\
    \ of addressees and maintainance of\n         the required data bases being a\
    \ related service), recording\n         (numbering and storing of items), cataloging,\
    \ and retrieval.\n   At the moment these services are fairly tightly interconnected\
    \ in the\n   NLS Journal and what we want to do is to decouple them and define\n\
    \   their intercommunication by protocols that would allow them to be\n   distributed\
    \ in different hosts on the network.  Mechanisms would also\n   be defined for\
    \ the several hosts performing similar services around\n   the network to work\
    \ together cooperatively.\n   As a further example, there are also other services\
    \ that NLS could\n   probably provide such as structured file creation and manipulation;\n\
    \   information portrayal online or in hardcopy; database querying etc.\n   However,\
    \ at the moment the system is not explicitly structured from\n   the point of\
    \ view that outside systems could come into it anywhere\n   but at the human user\
    \ interface even though internally it is quite\n   modular.  It would be straightforward\
    \ for us to identify those NLS\n   services that other system builders might possibly\
    \ be interested in\n   incorporating into their systems with their own user interface\
    \ and\n   then to do the restructuring and primitive command definition\n   necessary.\
    \  Other groups building systems on the network could\n   perform a similar examination.\n\
    \   CCA, on the other hand as I understand it, has taken this point of\n   view\
    \ from the beginning, namely building the Datacomputer on the\n   assumption that\
    \ it is primarily a network resource and is to be used\n   by other systems. \
    \ BBN is also moving in this direction in the design\n   of Distributed TENEX.\n\
    \   There is nothing new in the above ideas; they come from generalizing\n   past\
    \ successes we have all had with network protocol development and\n   with good\
    \ software engineering practices.  It will, however, take a\n   change in the\
    \ thinking of system designers, some concrete examples,\n   and ongoing dialog\
    \ to make such a design philosophy the normal\n   network way of life.\n"

  - "SOME FUNCTIONS READY FOR INTERCONNECTION\n   The area of dialog support may be\
    \ the first area ripe to create such\n   a synthesis with the several systems\
    \ in or coming into existence,\n   each solves part of the problem (with some\
    \ overlap).  The dialog\n   support systems on the network known to me are:\n\
    \      The NLS Journal (supports recorded and cataloged dialog and linked\n  \
    \    networks of documents and messages).\n      NLS Screen linking and splitting\
    \ (supports close collaboration of\n      two or more people working together\
    \ in real time in NLS)\n      The network wide linking of terminals through BBN's\
    \ RSEXEC.\n      Tenex Sndmsg and Readmail and other mail systems support\n  \
    \    nonrecorded dialog and further manipulation of received messages.\n     \
    \ (Some interconnection between NLS and these facilities has been\n      established).\n\
    \      The communication system under design at USC-ISI to support a\n      range\
    \ of message services.\n      The online conferencing system being built by Jim\
    \ Calvin of Case,\n      John Iseli of Mitre and others supports online conferencing\
    \ of\n      several members and has facilities to utilize various Tenex\n    \
    \  subsystems such as TECO and NLS to support conferees.\n      The Hack system\
    \ of CASE offers a bulletin board service.\n      The Forum system of IFF supports\
    \ online and distributed in time\n      conferencing and other features.\n   Other\
    \ areas possibly ripe for synthesis are 1) file and data\n   management, and information\
    \ retrieval services; 2) editing and\n   hardcopy portrayal with systems like\
    \ Tenex RUNOFF, SU-AI's PUB and\n   SRI-ARC's Output Processor.\n   If the salient\
    \ service features, concepts, goals of each could be\n   defined clearly and appropriate\
    \ service primitives, as per other\n   ARPANET protocols, could be defined for\
    \ each, anyone wishing to\n   incorporate that service with a user interface appropriate\
    \ to his\n   environment or philosophy could do so.\n"
- title: SYSTEM INTERCONNECTION ISSUES RELATED TO THE ABOVE PROPOSAL
  contents:
  - "SYSTEM INTERCONNECTION ISSUES RELATED TO THE ABOVE PROPOSAL\n   There are many\
    \ detailed issues related to system interconnection as\n   proposed above.  A\
    \ number seem worth mentioning here.\n   1) Types of Network Connections\n   \
    \   The number and type of network connections to be opened between\n      classes\
    \ of cooperating processes can probably be systematized.\n      One of the important\
    \ elements of the FTP and Graphics protocol\n      efforts was to define the number\
    \ and type of connections necessary\n      for these classes of transaction. \
    \ Similar classification and\n      connection definition will be required for\
    \ other types of\n      processes.\n   2) Data Structure Translation\n      The\
    \ whole area of translation and transfer of data structures more\n      complicated\
    \ than sequential files needs vigorous thought and\n      protocol development.\n\
    \         Systems built around sequential files are presently dominant on\n  \
    \       the ARPANET and provide a base for simple useful economical\n        \
    \ tools.  I, however, do not believe that the longer run tool\n         sharing\
    \ can depend on communication between sequential files,\n         but requires\
    \ structured files.  Experience with NLS tree\n         structured files shows\
    \ that even this level of structuring may\n         be inadequate for many uses\
    \ and more sophistication may be\n         required.  A similar trend exists in\
    \ work with computer\n         graphics and generalized data management systems.\
    \  Developing\n         protocols for handling structured data bases or agreement\
    \ on\n         common structuring characteristics seems an important need.\n \
    \  3) Responsiveness\n      Factors influencing responsiveness to users in an\
    \ environment of\n      heavy geographically separated resource sharing need determination\n\
    \      and discussion.\n   4) Documentation of System Interfaces\n      It is\
    \ probably reasonably straightforward to define service\n      interfaces, but\
    \ they will be useless unless their activating\n      command languages and other\
    \ conventions are well documented and\n      this documentation is kept up to\
    \ date.\n   5) Accounting\n      A very difficult problem once you interconnect\
    \ systems at lower\n      levels is to design an appropriate network accounting\
    \ and banking\n      system that will not cause undue delays in accessing distributed\n\
    \      resources.\n   6) Error Handling\n      We need to develop mechanisms for\
    \ passing error signals around\n      when system environments are crossing machine\
    \ boundaries.\n   7) Standard Parameter Formats\n      Data types such as strings,\
    \ integers, floating point numbers,\n      arrays, pointers, etc. need to have\
    \ standard representations\n      defined for passing parameters back and forth\
    \ between machines.\n   8) HELP at the Procedure Call Level\n      A HELP mechanism\
    \ needs to be defined in the protocols to provide\n      information that each\
    \ designer can translate to his user\n      interface.  Standards for requesting\
    \ HELP information and\n      structuring HELP data bases needs agreement.\n"
