  - "1.  Introduction\n   The mechanism described in [RFC6391] uses an additional
    label (Flow\n   Label) in the MPLS label stack to allow Label Switching Routers\n
    \  (LSRs) to balance flows within Pseudowires (PWs) at a finer\n   granularity
    than the individual PWs across the Equal Cost Multiple\n   Paths (ECMPs) that
    exists within the Packet Switched Network (PSN).\n   Furthermore, [RFC6391] defines
    the LDP protocol extensions required\n   to synchronize the flow label states
    between the ingress and egress\n   PEs when using the signaling procedures defined
    in the [RFC8077].\n   A PW [RFC3985] is transported over one single network path,
    even if\n   ECMPs exist between the ingress and egress PW provider edge (PE)\n
    \  equipment.  This is required to preserve the characteristics of the\n   emulated
    service.\n   This document introduces an optional mode of operation allowing a
    PW\n   to be transported over ECMPs, for example when the use of ECMPs is\n   known
    to be beneficial to the operation of the PW.  This\n   specification uses the
    principles defined in [RFC6391] and augments\n   the BGP-signaling procedures
    of [RFC4761] and [RFC6624].  The use of\n   a single path to preserve the packet
    delivery order remains the\n   default mode of operation of a PW and is described
    in [RFC4385] and\n   [RFC4928].\n   High-bandwidth Ethernet-based services are
    a prime example that use\n   of the optional mode benefits from the ability to
    load-balance flows\n   in a PW over multiple PSN paths.  In general, load-balancing
    is\n   applicable when the PW attachment circuit bandwidth and PSN core link\n
    \  bandwidth are of the same order of magnitude.\n   To achieve the load-balancing
    goal, [RFC6391] introduces the notion\n   of an additional Label Stack Entry (LSE)
    (flow label) located at the\n   bottom of the stack (right after PW LSE).  LSRs
    commonly generate a\n   hash of the label stack in order to discriminate and distribute
    flows\n   over available ECMPs.  The presence of the flow label (closely\n   associated
    to a flow determined by the ingress PE) will normally\n   provide the greatest
    entropy.\n   Furthermore, following the procedures for inter-AS scenarios\n   described
    in Section 3.4 of [RFC4761], the flow label should never be\n   handled by the
    ASBRs; only the terminating PEs on each AS will be\n   responsible for popping
    or pushing this label.  This is equally\n   applicable to Method B as described
    in Section 3.4.2 of [RFC4761],\n   where ASBRs are responsible for swapping the
    PW label as traffic\n   traverses from ASBR to PE and ASBR to ASBR.  Therefore,
    the flow\n   label will remain untouched across AS boundaries.\n"

    Community is used to signal control\n   information about the PWs to be set up.

    this Extended\n   Community is described as:\n            +------------------------------------+\n

  - "3.  Signaling the Presence of the Flow Label\n   As part of the PW signaling
    procedures described in [RFC4761], a\n   Layer2 Info Extended Community is advertised
    in the Virtual Private\n   LAN Service (VPLS) BGP Network Layer Reachability Information
    (NLRI).\n   A PE that wishes to send a flow label in a PW packet MUST include
    in\n   its VPLS BGP NLRI a Layer2 Info Extended Community using Control\n   Flags
    field with T = 1.\n   A PE that is willing to receive a flow label in a PW packet
    MUST\n   include in its VPLS BGP NLRI a Layer2 Info Extended Community using\n
    \  Control Flags field with R = 1.\n   A PE that receives a VPLS BGP NLRI containing
    a Layer2 Info Extended\n   Community with R = 0 MUST NOT include a flow label
    in the PW packet.\n   Therefore, a PE sending a Control Flags field with T = 1
    and\n   receiving a Control Flags field with R = 1 MUST include a flow label\n
    \  in the PW packet.  With any other combination, a PE MUST NOT include\n   a
    flow label in the PW packet.\n   A PE MAY support the configuration of the flow
    label (T and R bits)\n   on a per-service basis (e.g., a VPLS VPN Forwarding Instance
    (VFI)).\n   Furthermore, it is also possible that on a given service, PEs may
    not\n   share the same flow label settings.  The presence of a flow label is\n
    \  therefore determined on a per-peer basis and according to the local\n   and
    remote T and R bit values.  For example, a PE part of a VPLS and\n   with a local
    T = 1 must only transmit traffic with a flow label to\n   those peers that signaled
    R = 1.  If the same PE has local R = 1, it\n   must only expect to receive traffic
    with a flow label from peers with\n   T = 1.  Any other traffic must not have
    a flow label.  A PE expecting\n   to receive traffic from a remote peer with a
    flow label MAY drop\n   traffic that has no flow label.  A PE expecting to receive
    traffic\n   from a remote peer with no flow label MAY drop traffic that has a\n
    \  flow label.\n   Modification of flow label settings may impact traffic over
    a PW, as\n   these could trigger changes in the PEs data-plane programming (i.e.,\n
    \  imposition/disposition of the flow label).  This is an\n   implementation-specific
    behavior and is outside the scope of this\n   document.\n   The signaling procedures
    in [RFC4761] state that the unspecified bits\n   in the Control Flags field (bits
    0-5) MUST be set to zero when\n   sending and MUST be ignored when receiving.
    \ The signaling procedure\n   described here is therefore backwards compatible
    with existing\n   implementations.  A PE not supporting the extensions described
    in\n   this document will always advertise a value of zero in the R bit;\n   therefore,
    a flow label will never be included in a packet sent to it\n   by one of its peers.
    \ Similarly, it will always advertise a value of\n   zero in the T bit; therefore,
    a peer will know that a flow label will\n   never be included in a packet sent
    by it.\n   Note that what is signaled is the desire to include the flow LSE in\n
    \  the label stack.  The value of the flow label is a local matter for\n   the
    ingress PE, and the label value itself is not signaled.\n"
