- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   There is a long-standing tradition in the Internet community,\n\
    \   predating the IETF by many years, of use of the RFC Series to publish\n  \
    \ materials that are not rooted in the IETF standards process and its\n   review\
    \ and approval mechanisms.  These documents, known as\n   \"Independent Submissions\"\
    , serve a number of important functions for\n   the Internet community, both inside\
    \ and outside of the community of\n   active IETF participants.  This document\
    \ discusses the Independent\n   Submission model and some reasons why it is important.\
    \  It then\n   describes editorial and processing norms that can be used for\n\
    \   Independent Submissions as the community goes forward into new\n   relationships\
    \ between the IETF community and its primary technical\n   publisher.\n   To understand\
    \ the perspective of this document, it is important to\n   remember that the RFC\
    \ Editor function predates the creation of the\n   IETF.  As of the time of this\
    \ writing, the RFC Series goes back 38\n   years [RFC2555], while the IETF is\
    \ celebrating its 21st anniversary.\n   All of the documents that were published\
    \ before the IETF was created,\n   and for some years thereafter, would be considered\
    \ Independent\n   Submissions today.  As the IETF evolved, the Internet Architecture\n\
    \   Board (IAB) and then the IETF itself chose to publish IETF documents\n   as\
    \ RFCs while fully understanding that the RFC Editor function was an\n   independent\
    \ publication mechanism.  Other decisions were possible:\n   e.g., the IETF could\
    \ have decided to create its own publication\n   series.  It was felt that there\
    \ was considerable value in continuing\n   to publish the IETF work in the same\
    \ series as the one used to\n   publish the basic protocols for the Internet.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology Note
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology Note\n   This document describes what have historically been\
    \ referred to as\n   \"Independent Submissions\".  That term is distinguished\
    \ from those\n   IETF and IAB community documents that originate from formal groups\
    \ --\n   the IAB, IRTF, and IETF Working Groups -- and from submissions\n   submitted\
    \ to the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) for\n   Standards-Track, Informational,\
    \ or Experimental processing.\n   Documents produced by individuals, rather than\
    \ IETF WGs or others\n   IETF-affiliated groups, but submitted for publication\
    \ via the IESG\n   under Area Director sponsorship, are known as \"individual\n\
    \   submissions\".\n   For convenience and obvious historical reasons, the editor\
    \ and\n   publisher of documents that are not processed through the IETF is\n\
    \   known below as the \"RFC Editor\".  The RFC Editor will typically be an\n\
    \   organization of one or more senior people and associated editorial\n   staff,\
    \ and the term is used collectively below.  That term is not\n   intended to predict\
    \ the future, either in terms of who does the job\n   or what they, or the document\
    \ series, are called.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Context and Philosophical Assumptions
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Context and Philosophical Assumptions\n   This document complements the\
    \ discussion and guidelines in [RFC4714],\n   which focuses on Standards-Track\
    \ documents.  It takes a somewhat\n   stronger view than the discussions that\
    \ led to that document,\n   starting from the belief that Independent Submissions\
    \ are most\n   valuable if they are, in fact, independent of the IETF process.\
    \  From\n   the perspective of the IETF, Independent Submissions are especially\n\
    \   important as checks on the IETF processes even though such checks are\n  \
    \ not the only, or even a common, reason for them.  That role is\n   compromised\
    \ if IETF-related entities are able to block or deprecate\n   such documents to\
    \ a degree beyond that needed to avoid difficulties\n   with the standards process.\n"
- title: 2.  The Role of Independent Submissions
  contents:
  - "2.  The Role of Independent Submissions\n   When the RFC Series was fairly new,\
    \ RFCs were used to publish general\n   papers on networking as well as the types\
    \ of documents we would\n   describe as standards today.  Those roles also developed\
    \ as part of\n   the early design and development of the ARPANET, long before\
    \ anyone\n   dreamt of the IETF and when the distinction between, e.g., Standards\n\
    \   and Informational documents was less precisely drawn.  In more recent\n  \
    \ years, Independent Submissions have become important for multiple\n   reasons,\
    \ some of them relatively new.  They include:\n   o  Discussion of Internet-related\
    \ technologies that are not part of\n      the IETF agenda.\n   o  Introduction\
    \ of important new ideas as a bridge publication venue\n      between academia\
    \ and IETF engineering.\n   o  Informational discussions of technologies, options,\
    \ or experience\n      with protocols.\n   o  Informational publication of vendor-specific\
    \ protocols.\n   o  Critiques and discussions of alternatives to IETF Standards-Track\n\
    \      protocols.  The potential for such critiques provides an important\n  \
    \    check on the IETF's standards processes and should be seen in that\n    \
    \  light.\n   o  Documents considered by IETF Working Groups but not standardized.\n\
    \      While many documents of this type are still published in the IETF\n   \
    \   document stream (see [RFC4844], Section 5.1.1) as Informational or\n     \
    \ Experimental RFCs, the Independent Submission path has\n      traditionally\
    \ been open to them as well.  However, because of\n      their intimate connection\
    \ to the IETF Standards Process and WG\n      activities and the consequent sensitivity\
    \ to exact statements of\n      relationships and to timing, there is reason to\
    \ believe that such\n      documents should normally be published via the IETF\
    \ document\n      stream.  In any event, these documents are published for the\n\
    \      historical record.\n   o  Satirical materials.\n   o  Meeting notes and\
    \ reports (RFC 21 [RFC0021] is the earliest; RFC\n      1109 [RFC1109] is probably\
    \ the most important).\n   o  Editorials (the best example is IEN 137 [IEN137],\
    \ not an RFC).\n   o  Eulogies (RFC 2441 [RFC2441]).\n   o  Technical contributions\
    \ (e.g., RFC 1810 [RFC1810]).\n   o  Historically, RFC Editor and, at least prior\
    \ to the handoff\n      between the Informational Sciences Institute (ISI) and\
    \ the\n      Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and\n\
    \      the June 2000 MOU [RFC2860], Internet Assigned Numbers Authority\n    \
    \  (IANA) Policy Statements (e.g., RFC 2223 [RFC2223] and RFC 1591\n      [RFC1591]).\n\
    \   It should be clear from the list above that, to be effective, the\n   review\
    \ and approval process for Independent Submissions should be\n   largely independent\
    \ of the IETF.  As an important principle that has\n   been applied historically,\
    \ the RFC Editor seeks advice from the IESG\n   about possible relationships and\
    \ conflicts with IETF work.  Any\n   submission that constitutes an alternative\
    \ to, or is in conflict\n   with, an IETF Standard or proposal for Standards-Track\
    \ adoption must\n   clearly indicate that relationship.  The IESG may identify\
    \ such\n   conflicts as part of its review.\n   The specific procedures to be\
    \ followed in review are described in\n   Section 4 and Section 5.\n"
- title: 3.  Document Submission
  contents:
  - "3.  Document Submission\n   Independent Submissions are submitted directly to\
    \ the RFC Editor.\n   They must first be posted as Internet-Drafts (I-Ds), so\
    \ the\n   submission is typically simply a note requesting that the RFC Editor\n\
    \   consider a particular Internet-Draft for publication.  The process is\n  \
    \ described in [RFC2223].  Further information can be found in the\n   working\
    \ draft of an update of that document [RFC2223BIS].\n   Any document that meets\
    \ the requirements of this specification, of\n   [RFC2223] and its successors,\
    \ and of any intellectual property or\n   other conditions that may be established\
    \ from time to time, may be\n   submitted to the RFC Editor for consideration\
    \ as an Independent\n   Submission.  However, the RFC Editor prefers that documents\
    \ created\n   through IETF processes (e.g., working group output) be considered\
    \ by\n   the IESG and submitted using this path only if a working group or the\n\
    \   IESG declines to publish it.  In the latter cases, the review process\n  \
    \ will be more efficient if the authors provide a history of\n   consideration\
    \ and reviews of the document at the time of submission.\n"
- title: 4.  The Review Process
  contents:
  - "4.  The Review Process\n   In general, the steps in the review process are identified\
    \ in the\n   subsections below.  Any of them may be iterated and, at the\n   discretion\
    \ of the RFC Editor, steps after the first may be taken out\n   of order.  In\
    \ addition, the IESG review, as discussed in Section 5,\n   must take place before\
    \ a final decision is made on whether to publish\n   the document.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Posting of Draft
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Posting of Draft\n   The author(s) or editor(s) of a document post it as\
    \ an Internet-\n   Draft.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Request for Publication
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Request for Publication\n   After the normal opportunity for community\
    \ review and feedback\n   provided by the submission of the I-D and the I-D repository\n\
    \   announcement thereof, the author or editor sends a request for\n   consideration\
    \ for publication to the RFC Editor at\n   rfc-editor@rfc-editor.org.  That request\
    \ should note any community\n   discussion or reviews of the document that have\
    \ occurred before\n   submission, as well as the desired document category (Informational\n\
    \   or Experimental, as discussed in RFC 2026 [RFC2026], Section 4.2).\n   If\
    \ the document requires any IANA allocations, authors should take\n   care to\
    \ check the assignment policy for the relevant namespace, since\n   some assignment\
    \ policies (e.g., \"IETF Consensus\") cannot be used by\n   Independent Submissions.\
    \  See RFC 2434 [RFC2434] for more\n   information.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Initial RFC Editor Review
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Initial RFC Editor Review\n   RFC Editor staff performs an initial check\
    \ on the document to\n   determine whether there are obvious issues or problems\
    \ and to decide\n   on the sequencing of other steps.\n   At any time during the\
    \ process, the RFC Editor may make general\n   and/or specific suggestions to\
    \ the author on how to improve the\n   editorial quality of the document and note\
    \ any specific violations of\n   the rules.  The author will be expected to make\
    \ the suggested\n   updates, submit a new version, and inform the RFC Editor.\
    \  This may\n   be repeated as often as necessary to obtain an acceptable editorial\n\
    \   quality.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Review and Evaluation
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Review and Evaluation\n   The RFC Editor arranges for one or more reviews\
    \ of the document.\n   This may include Editorial Board (see Section 6) reviews\
    \ or reviews\n   by others.  Unsolicited reviews from parties independent of the\n\
    \   author are welcome at any time.\n   At minimum, the author of every document\
    \ shall receive a written\n   summary of the review(s).  Reviewer anonymity is\
    \ discussed in\n   Section 7.  The RFC Editor may also share reviews with the\
    \ Editorial\n   Board.\n   An author rebuttal to some aspect of a review, followed\
    \ by a healthy\n   technical dialog among the author and the reviewer(s), is fully\n\
    \   appropriate.  Consensus followed by document revision is the desired\n   outcome.\n\
    \   The RFC Editor is expected to consider all competent reviews\n   carefully,\
    \ and in the absence of some unusual circumstance, a\n   preponderance of favorable\
    \ reviews should lead to publication.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Additional Reviews
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Additional Reviews\n   If the author is dissatisfied with one or more review(s),\
    \ the author\n   may request that the RFC Editor solicit additional reviews. \
    \ In\n   exceptional circumstances, the author may request that the IAB review\n\
    \   the document.  Such requests to the IAB, and any reviews the IAB\n   chooses\
    \ to perform, will occur according to procedures of the IAB's\n   choosing.  The\
    \ IAB is not required to initiate a review or comply\n   with a request for one:\
    \ a request to the IAB for a review is not an\n   appeal process.\n"
- title: 4.6.  Document Rejection
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Document Rejection\n   If any stage of the review process just described\
    \ leads to the\n   conclusion that the document is not publishable, the RFC Editor\
    \ may\n   reject the document.  Such rejection would normally be based on the\n\
    \   conclusion that the submission does not meet the technical or\n   editorial\
    \ standards of the RFC Series or is not relevant to the areas\n   that the series\
    \ covers.\n   If a document is rejected by the RFC Editor, the author may request\n\
    \   an additional review from the IAB, as described below, but the IAB is\n  \
    \ not obligated to perform that review, nor is the RFC Editor obligated\n   to\
    \ publish it, even with a favorable IAB review.\n"
- title: 4.7.  Final Decision and Notification
  contents:
  - "4.7.  Final Decision and Notification\n   In all cases, the ultimate decision\
    \ to publish or not publish, and\n   with what text, rests with the RFC Editor.\n\
    \   The RFC Editor will communicate the final decision to the author and\n   the\
    \ Editorial Board.  For a rejection, there will be a summary of the\n   reason(s)\
    \ for the action.\n   Information about any IESG-requested publication delay or\
    \ request to\n   not publish a document will be posted to the RFC Editor Web site\
    \ to\n   supplement document status information.\n"
- title: 4.8.  Final Editing and Publication
  contents:
  - "4.8.  Final Editing and Publication\n   Once a document is approved for publication,\
    \ it is handled in a\n   fashion similar to other RFCs, with principles about\
    \ priorities\n   worked out with the IAB as appropriate.\n"
- title: 5.  Formal IESG Review
  contents:
  - "5.  Formal IESG Review\n   At an appropriate time in the review process, normally\
    \ after the RFC\n   Editor has made a tentative decision to publish, the document\
    \ is\n   forwarded to the IESG for evaluation with a relatively short timeout.\n\
    \   If the nature of the document persuades the RFC Editor or the IESG\n   that\
    \ the interests of the community or efficiency in the publication\n   process\
    \ would be better served by a different schedule, then that\n   schedule should\
    \ be followed.  For example, if it appears to the RFC\n   Editor that it is likely\
    \ that the IESG will wish to take the document\n   over and assign it to a working\
    \ group, it may be better to ask for\n   the IESG review prior to incurring the\
    \ delays associated with other\n   reviews or significant editorial work.\n  \
    \ The IESG evaluation is not a technical one.  Instead, it covers the\n   issues\
    \ listed in RFC 3932 [RFC3932] or its successors, presumably\n   from the perspective\
    \ outlined above in Section 1.2.  That is, the\n   evaluation should focus exclusively\
    \ on conflicts or confusion with\n   IETF process and attempts to subvert (\"\
    end run\") working group\n   activities.\n   At the time the document is forwarded\
    \ to the IESG, the RFC Editor\n   posts an indication on its Web site that the\
    \ document is under IESG\n   review and that comments on conflicts can be sent\
    \ to the IESG with\n   copies to the RFC Editor.  Additional mechanisms may be\
    \ developed\n   from time to time to inform a community that a document is entering\n\
    \   formal prepublication review.  Comments not directly related to IETF\n   procedures\
    \ or conflicts may be sent directly to the author(s) and RFC\n   Editor.\n   In\
    \ addition to the IESG review for conflict with IETF work,\n   individuals in\
    \ the IESG or in the broader IETF community are free to\n   review a draft and,\
    \ if they have comments of any kind --including the\n   extreme case of believing\
    \ that the proposal is damaging to the\n   Internet as a whole-- these comments\
    \ should be directed to the\n   author(s) and the RFC Editor.\n   If the IESG,\
    \ after completing its review, identifies issues, it may\n   recommend explanatory\
    \ or qualifying text for the RFC Editor to\n   include in the document if it is\
    \ published.\n   If the IESG concludes that publication of the document should\
    \ be\n   delayed for a reasonable period of time because its untimely\n   publication\
    \ could cause confusion or other harm with proposals under\n   consideration for\
    \ standardization, the RFC Editor will grant that\n   request.  The current agreement\
    \ between the RFC Editor and the IESG\n   on requested delays is expected to continue.\
    \  That agreement permits\n   the IESG to ask for a delay of up to six months\
    \ and, if necessary, to\n   renew that request twice, for a total possible delay\
    \ of 18 months.\n   If the IESG concludes that the document should not be published\
    \ as an\n   RFC, it will request that the RFC Editor not publish and provide\n\
    \   appropriate justification for that request.  The RFC Editor will\n   consider\
    \ the request to not publish the document.\n   The RFC Editor or the author may\
    \ request that the IAB review the\n   IESG's request to delay or not publish the\
    \ document and request that\n   the IAB provide an additional opinion.  Such a\
    \ request will be made\n   public via the RFC Editor Web site.  As with the IESG\
    \ review itself,\n   the IAB's opinion, if any, will be advisory.  And, as with\
    \ author\n   requests for an IAB technical review (see Section 4.5), the IAB is\n\
    \   not obligated to perform this type of review and may decline the\n   request.\n"
- title: 6.  The Editorial Review Board
  contents:
  - "6.  The Editorial Review Board\n   The RFC Editor appoints and maintains the\
    \ Editorial Review Board,\n   which, much like the editorial boards of professional\
    \ journals and\n   publishers, provides the RFC Editor with both advice and reviews\
    \ of\n   particular proposed publications and general and strategic policy\n \
    \  advice.  The membership list of the Editorial Review Board is public\n   and\
    \ can be found at http://www.rfc-editor.org/edboard.html.\n   Editorial Board\
    \ members serve at the pleasure of the RFC Editor.\n   From time to time, the\
    \ RFC Editor will solicit suggestions for new\n   appointees from the IAB and\
    \ other sources and will seek IAB comments\n   on those to be appointed.  The\
    \ RFC Editor will also solicit IAB\n   comments on the effectiveness of the review\
    \ process and the quality\n   of documents being published and criteria applied.\
    \  However, to\n   ensure the independence of the Independent Submission process,\
    \ the\n   final decision to appoint (or not appoint) Editorial Board members\n\
    \   rests with the RFC Editor.\n"
- title: 7.  Status and Availability of Reviews
  contents:
  - "7.  Status and Availability of Reviews\n   The RFC Editor will conduct the reviews\
    \ discussed above with the\n   intent of balancing fairness to authors, transparency\
    \ of the review\n   process to the general community, protection of reviewers\
    \ from\n   possible retaliation or undue pressure, and the interest of the\n \
    \  community in having any significant dissents from published documents\n   available\
    \ to the community with the same degree of scrutiny that the\n   original documents\
    \ received.  To this end, reviews and information\n   about reviewers will be\
    \ made public under the following\n   circumstances.  In special cases in which\
    \ other considerations apply,\n   the RFC Editor may adopt special provisions\
    \ after reviewing the\n   circumstances and proposed action with the IAB.\n  \
    \ Any reviewer participating in the process outlined in this document\n   does\
    \ so on the condition of giving consent to handling of the reviews\n   as outlined\
    \ in this section.  In special cases, individual\n   arrangements may be worked\
    \ out in advance with the RFC Editor.\n   As described in Section 4.4, all reviews\
    \ will be shared with the\n   document authors (with possible editing to remove\
    \ any extreme\n   language).  The names of the reviewers will normally accompany\
    \ these\n   reviews, but reviewers will be granted anonymity upon request to the\n\
    \   RFC Editor.  The RFC Editor will in any case forward any author\n   rebuttal\
    \ messages to the reviewer.\n   Nothing in this section or the subsections below\
    \ precludes private\n   communications between reviewers, the Editorial Board,\
    \ and the RFC\n   Editor; such communications will remain confidential.\n"
- title: 7.1.  Posted Reviews
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Posted Reviews\n   Once a final accept or reject decision has been made\
    \ on a document,\n   the RFC Editor may choose to post the full set of reviews\
    \ (and author\n   rebuttals, if any) associated with a document, if doing so would\
    \ be\n   in the best interest of the community.  The author may request\n   earlier\
    \ posting of reviews and rebuttals, to inspire additional\n   unsolicited reviews,\
    \ for example.  The names of the reviewers will\n   accompany their reviews, except\
    \ for a reviewer who requested\n   anonymity.\n   The author will be notified\
    \ in advance of the intent to post the\n   final reviews.  The author may then\
    \ request that the document be\n   withdrawn and the reviews kept private.  However,\
    \ such an author\n   request must be timely, generally within 14 days of the notification\n\
    \   of intent to post.\n"
- title: 7.2.  Rejected Documents
  contents:
  - "7.2.  Rejected Documents\n   If the RFC Editor rejects a document, the author\
    \ has the following\n   options for recourse.\n   o  Request one or more additional\
    \ reviews (Section 4.5) followed by a\n      reconsideration.\n   o  Request an\
    \ IAB review (Section 4.5, Section 4.6) followed by a\n      reconsideration.\n\
    \   o  Request that the reviews be published on the RFC Editor Web site.\n"
- title: 7.3.  Documents Approved for Publication
  contents:
  - "7.3.  Documents Approved for Publication\n   In considering whether to make review\
    \ materials public for documents\n   accepted for publication, the RFC Editor\
    \ is expected to note that the\n   best way to comment on or dissent from an RFC\
    \ is generally another\n   RFC; that reviews critical of a document are not themselves\
    \ reviewed;\n   that the review and refutation process is necessarily fragmentary;\n\
    \   and that a reviewer who feels strongly about a subject about which a\n   review\
    \ has already been written often would not need to do\n   significant additional\
    \ work to produce an RFC-format document from\n   that review.\n"

    \ to\n   initialize the process of separating discussions of Independent\n   Submissions\
    \ from those about Standards-Track or other IETF documents.\n   Note that the\
    \ text that follows uses the term \"RFC Editor\n   Contribution\" to describe\
    \ the same type of document referred to as an\n   \"Independent Submission\" elsewhere\
    \ in this document.  The RFC Editor\n   may change these provisions from time\
