  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has defined\
    \ a Mission\n   Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) over LTE service [TS.3GPP.22.179].\
    \  The\n   MCPTT service supports an enhanced Push To Talk (PTT) service that\
    \ is\n   suitable for mission critical scenarios and is based upon 3GPP\n   Evolved\
    \ Packet System (EPS) services.  The requirements for the MCPTT\n   service defined\
    \ within 3GPP can also form the basis for other PTT\n   services.\n   The MCPTT\
    \ service is intended to support communication between\n   several users (a group\
    \ call), where each user can gain permission to\n   talk in an arbitrated manner.\
    \  However, the MCPTT service also\n   supports private calls between pairs of\
    \ users.\n   MCPTT is primarily targeted to provide a professional PTT service\
    \ to,\n   e.g., public safety, transport companies, utilities, and industrial\n\
    \   and nuclear plants.  In addition to this, a commercial PTT service\n   for\
    \ non-professional use (e.g., groups of people on holiday) may be\n   delivered\
    \ through an MCPTT system.  Based on their operational model,\n   the performance\
    \ and MCPTT features in use vary per user organization,\n   where functionality\
    \ that is more mission-critical-specific (e.g.,\n   Imminent Peril Call) might\
    \ not be available to commercial customers.\n   The MCPTT service provides its\
    \ users with different priorities for\n   the access to network resources in order\
    \ to provide means to\n   prioritize between calls when resources are scarce.\
    \  Among other\n   things, these priorities take into account the priority and\
    \ role of\n   the caller, the priority and type of the group, and the situation\
    \ in\n   which the call is made.\n   The SIP-level call control procedures using\
    \ these namespaces are\n   specified in [TS.3GPP.24.379].  The namespaces defined\
    \ here will\n   support a wide range of queuing options.  The namespaces correspond\n\
    \   to what can be supported over the 3GPP Rx interface, defined in\n   [TS.3GPP.29.214].\
    \  The usage of the namespaces can be tailored to the\n   needs of the operator.\
    \  The mechanism to do this is to configure\n   which values a specific user is\
    \ allowed to use.  This configuration\n   is specified in [TS.3GPP.24.384].\n\
    \   High-priority calls (when the life of either a public safety worker\n   or\
    \ anyone else is in danger) need to be set up immediately; thus,\n   they require\
    \ preemption.  Other calls may be less sensitive in call\n   setup time but have\
    \ a high priority once established.  For these\n   calls, a queueing mechanism\
    \ is more appropriate.  The MCPTT data\n   transfer service currently under development\
    \ can benefit from a\n   queueing mechanism.  Another example is video-only calls\
    \ that are not\n   critical in call setup time but where keeping the call is important.\n\
    \   This document creates additional SIP Resource-Priority namespaces to\n   meet\
    \ the requirements of the 3GPP-defined MCPTT and places these\n   namespaces in\
    \ the IANA registry.\n"
- title: 2.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "2.  Applicability\n   This document defines namespaces applicable for MCPTT services\n\
    \   defined by 3GPP that use the network services of a 3GPP-defined LTE\n   network.\
    \  The use of this namespace outside such networks is\n   undefined.\n"
