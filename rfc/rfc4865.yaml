  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines an extension to the SMTP submission protocol for\
    \ a\n   client to indicate a future time for the message to be released for\n\
    \   delivery.  This extension permits a client to use server-based\n   storage\
    \ for a message that should be held in queue until an appointed\n   time in the\
    \ future.  This is useful for clients which do not have\n   local storage or are\
    \ otherwise unable to release a message for\n   delivery at an appointed time.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   There is a widely used feature within the voice messaging\
    \ community\n   to compose and send a message for delivery in the future.  This\
    \ is\n   useful for sending announcements to be heard at the beginning of a\n\
    \   work day, to send birthday greetings a day or so ahead, or to use as\n   a\
    \ lightweight facility to build a personal reminder service.\n   This extension\
    \ uses the SMTP submission protocol [n3] to allow a\n   client, when submitting\
    \ a message, to indicate a future time for the\n   message to be released for\
    \ delivery.\n"

- title: 3.  Framework
  contents:
  - "3.  Framework\n   The Future Message Release service extension for SMTP submission\
    \ uses\n   the SMTP service extension mechanism [n4] to extend the SMTP\n   submission\
    \ protocol [n3].  The following SMTP submission service\n   extension is hereby\
    \ defined:\n   The name of the SMTP submission service extension is \"Future Message\n\
    \   Release\".\n   1) The Extended Hello (EHLO) keyword associated with this service\n\
    \   extension is \"FUTURERELEASE\".\n   2) Two required parameters, the max-future-release-interval\
    \ and the\n   max-future-release-date-time, are combined with the EHLO keyword\
    \ in\n   the manner specified in [n4].\n   The max-future-release-interval is\
    \ a positive integer indicating the\n   maximum amount of time for which the message\
    \ submission server (MSA)\n   will hold messages for future release.\n   Using\
    \ ABNF [n2], the syntax of this parameter is as follows:\n         future-release-integer\
    \ = %x31-39 *8DIGIT\n                                  ; integer in the range\
    \ 1-999999999\n                                  ; measured in seconds\n     \
    \    max-future-release-interval = future-release-integer\n      The max-future-release-date-time\
    \ is a timestamp, normalized to\n      Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), indicating\
    \ the most remote date\n      and time in the future until which the MSA will\
    \ hold messages for\n      future release.\n      Using ABNF [n2], the syntax\
    \ of this parameter is as follows:\n         max-future-release-date-time = date-time\n\
    \      where the format of date-time is defined in [n10].\n   3) When forming\
    \ the portion of the EHLO reply containing the\n      FUTURERELEASE keyword, the\
    \ keyword is followed by the max-future-\n      release-interval, and then the\
    \ max-future-release-date-time.  The\n      keyword and two values are delimited\
    \ by spaces.\n      For example, the ABNF for a continuation line in the EHLO\
    \ response\n      that contains the FUTURERELEASE keyword is:\n         line =\
    \ \"250-FUTURERELEASE\" SP max-future-release-interval\n                     \
    \               SP max-future-release-date-time\n   4) One required parameter,\
    \ the hold-param, is added to the MAIL\n      command using either the keyword\
    \ \"HOLDFOR\" or the keyword\n      \"HOLDUNTIL\".\n      The HOLDFOR parameter\
    \ value is a future-release-interval, which is\n      a positive integer indicating\
    \ the amount of time the message is to\n      be held by the MSA before release.\n\
    \      The HOLDUNTIL parameter value is a future-release-date-time, which\n  \
    \    is a timestamp, normalized to UTC, indicating the future date and\n     \
    \ time until which the message is to be held by the MSA before\n      release.\n\
    \      Using ABNF [n2], the syntax of this parameter is as follows:\n        \
    \ future-release-interval = future-release-integer\n         future-release-date-time\
    \ = Internet-style-date-time-UTC\n         hold-for-param = \"HOLDFOR=\" future-release-interval\n\
    \         hold-until-param = \"HOLDUNTIL=\" future-release-date-time\n       \
    \  hold-param = hold-for-param / hold-until-param\n      The absence of this parameter\
    \ on the MAIL command does not imply a\n      default value for this parameter.\n\
    \   5) The maximum length of a MAIL command is increased by 34 characters\n  \
    \    by the possible addition of the hold-param.\n   6) No additional SMTP verbs\
    \ are defined by this extension.\n   7) This service extension is appropriate\
    \ only for the SMTP submission\n      protocol [n3].  This service extension is\
    \ not appropriate for\n      standard SMTP [n4].\n"
- title: 4.  Behavior
  contents:
  - "4.  Behavior\n   It is unfortunate to define two seemingly identical ways to\
    \ indicate\n   a future message release time.  When the client has both accurate\n\
    \   time and accurate time zone information, either interval or date-time\n  \
    \ can be trivially calculated from the other.  However, in the current\n   world\
    \ of clients, there are clients with accurate local time but no\n   indication\
    \ of their time zone, and clients without a suitably\n   accurate clock.  Based\
    \ on the limited facilities available to these\n   time-challenged clients, it\
    \ is likely that only one or the other of\n   these mechanisms will be useful.\n\
    \   It is believed that servers will have accurate time, and can\n   trivially\
    \ convert between these mechanisms.  It is also accepted that\n   the protocol\
    \ and implementation overhead of offering these two\n   mechanisms is low, and\
    \ that few interoperability challenges are\n   anticipated.\n"

    \ MUST first\n      verify that the MSA supports this extension.\n   2) An SMTP\
    \ client using Future Message Release MUST include one, and\n      only one, hold-param\
    \ with the MAIL command.\n   3) An SMTP client using Future Message Release with\
    \ the \"for\" option\n      of the hold-param MUST ensure that the future-release-interval\
    \ is\n      less than or equal to the max-future-release-interval advertised\n\
    \      by the MSA.\n   4) An SMTP client using Future Message Release with the\
    \ \"until\"\n      option of the hold-param MUST ensure that the future-release-\n\
    \      date-time is earlier than or equal to the max-future-release-\n      date-time\

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The Future Message Release service extension\
    \ presents a number of\n   security considerations:\n   1) Unauthorized future-release\
    \ messages provide a means to overwhelm\n      the storage of an MSA.  The authorization\
    \ mechanisms required for\n      the base mail submission protocol [n3] are expected\
    \ to provide\n      appropriate defense against such attacks.\n   2) Authorized\
    \ future message release without a per-user quota may\n      also provide a way\
    \ to overwhelm an MSA's storage.  An MSA's future\n      release message storage\
    \ SHOULD be subject to a per-user quota.\n   3) If an MSA is imposing a per-user\
    \ quota on future-release message\n      storage, and detects that an incoming\
    \ future-release message will\n      exceed the user's future-release message\
    \ storage quota, the MSA\n      MUST reject the MAIL command.\n   4) When an MSA\
    \ is rejecting a MAIL command per 5.3, it SHOULD supply\n      the reply code\
    \ 552 (requested mail action aborted: exceeded\n      storage allocation [n4])\
    \ in the reply.\n   5) When an MSA is rejecting a MAIL command per 5.3, it SHOULD\
    \ supply\n      the new Enhanced Mail System Status Code defined for this purpose.\n\
    \      This new status code updates [i1].\n      X.7.16   Future release per-user\
    \ message quota exceeded\n         There is insufficient per-user quota to queue\
    \ the message for\n         future release.  This code suggests the client can\
    \ submit again\n         only after the per-user queue has drained.\n      X.7.17\
    \   Future release system message quota exceeded\n         There is insufficient\
    \ system quota to queue the message for\n         future release.  This code suggests\
    \ the client can submit again\n         after the system queue has drained.\n\
    \   6) Inaccurate time on the MSA may result in premature or delayed\n      release\
    \ of messages.  Both HOLDUNTIL and HOLDFOR request\n      mechanisms are sensitive\
    \ to inaccurate or changing clocks on the\n      MSA.\n   7) Some element of deception\
    \ is inherent in the future message\n      release concept.  The message release\
    \ time is intentionally\n      delayed past the time it would otherwise be released;\
    \ hence, the\n      message delivery time is delayed past the time it would otherwise\n\
    \      be delivered.  This extension provides no mechanism for hiding\n      this\
    \ from the message recipient.  The RFC 2822 [n5] message\n      header, and specifically\
    \ the Date field, remain unchanged after\n      submission.  While a sending client\
    \ MAY elect to place the\n      future-message-release-time as the date in the\
    \ Date field, there\n      is no requirement or expectation that the Received\
    \ fields and\n      other trace information be modified by the transport system\
    \ to\n      further this deception.\n"
