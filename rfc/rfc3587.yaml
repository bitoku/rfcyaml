  contents:
  - "2.  TLA/NLA Made Historic\n   The TLA/NLA scheme has been replaced by a coordinated\
    \ allocation\n   policy defined by the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) [IPV6RIR].\n\
    \   Part of the motivation for obsoleting the TLA/NLA structure is\n   technical;\
    \ for instance, there is concern that TLA/NLA is not the\n   technically best\
    \ approach at this stage of the deployment of IPv6.\n   Moreover, the allocation\
    \ of IPv6 addresses is related to policy and\n   to the stewardship of the IP\
    \ address space and routing table size,\n   which the RIRs have been managing\
    \ for IPv4.  It is likely that the\n   RIRs' policy will evolve as IPv6 deployment\
    \ proceeds.\n   The IETF has provided technical input to the RIRs (for example,\n\
    \   [RFC3177]), which the RIRs have taken into account when defining\n   their\
    \ address allocation policy.\n   RFC 2374 was the definition of addresses for\
    \ Format Prefix 001\n   (2000::/3) which is formally made historic by this document.\
    \  Even\n   though currently only 2000::/3 is being delegated by the IANA,\n \
    \  implementations should not make any assumptions about 2000::/3 being\n   special.\
    \  In the future, the IANA might be directed to delegate\n   currently unassigned\
    \ portions of the IPv6 address space for the\n   purpose of Global Unicast as\
    \ well.\n   The Subnet Local Aggregator (SLA) field in RFC 2374 remains in\n \
    \  function but with a different name in [ARCH].  Its new name is\n   \"subnet\
    \ ID\".\n"
- title: 3.  Address Format
  contents:
  - "3.  Address Format\n   The general format for IPv6 global unicast addresses as\
    \ defined in\n   \"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture\" [ARCH] is as follows:\n\
    \    |         n bits          |   m bits  |       128-n-m bits         |\n  \
    \  +-------------------------+-----------+----------------------------+\n    |\
    \ global routing prefix   | subnet ID |       interface ID         |\n    +-------------------------+-----------+----------------------------+\n\
    \   where the global routing prefix is a (typically\n   hierarchically-structured)\
    \ value assigned to a site (a cluster of\n   subnets/links), the subnet ID is\
    \ an identifier of a subnet within the\n   site, and the interface ID is as defined\
    \ in section 2.5.1 of [ARCH].\n   The global routing prefix is designed to be\
    \ structured hierarchically\n   by the RIRs and ISPs.  The subnet field is designed\
    \ to be structured\n   hierarchically by site administrators.\n   [ARCH] also\
    \ requires that all unicast addresses, except those that\n   start with binary\
    \ value 000, have Interface IDs that are 64 bits long\n   and to be constructed\
    \ in Modified EUI-64 format.  The format of\n   global unicast address in this\
    \ case is:\n    |         n bits          | 64-n bits |       64 bits        \
    \      |\n    +-------------------------+-----------+----------------------------+\n\
    \    | global routing prefix   | subnet ID |       interface ID         |\n  \
    \  +-------------------------+-----------+----------------------------+\n   where\
    \ the routing prefix is a value assigned to identify a site (a\n   cluster of\
    \ subnets/links), the subnet ID is an identifier of a subnet\n   within the site,\
    \ and the interface ID is a modified EUI-64 format as\n   defined in [ARCH].\n\
    \   An example of the resulting format of global unicast address under\n   the\
    \ 2000::/3 prefix that is currently being delegated by the IANA and\n   consistent\
    \ with the recommendations in RFC 3177 is:\n    | 3 |     45 bits         |  16\
    \ bits  |       64 bits              |\n    +---+---------------------+-----------+----------------------------+\n\
    \    |001|global routing prefix| subnet ID |       interface ID         |\n  \
    \  +---+---------------------+-----------+----------------------------+\n"
