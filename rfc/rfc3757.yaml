  - "1.  Introduction\n   \"All keys are equal but some keys are more equal than others\"\
    \ [6].\n   With the definition of the Delegation Signer Resource Record (DS RR)\n\
    \   [5], it has become important to differentiate between the keys in the\n  \
    \ DNSKEY RR set that are (to be) pointed to by parental DS RRs and the\n   other\
    \ keys in the DNSKEY RR set.  We refer to these public keys as\n   Secure Entry\
    \ Point (SEP) keys.  A SEP key either used to generate a\n   DS RR or is distributed\
    \ to resolvers that use the key as the root of\n   a trusted subtree [3].\n  \
    \ In early deployment tests, the use of two (kinds of) key pairs for\n   each\
    \ zone has been prevalent.  For one kind of key pair the private\n   key is used\
    \ to sign just the zone's DNSKEY resource record (RR) set.\n   Its public key\
    \ is intended to be referenced by a DS RR at the parent\n   or configured statically\
    \ in a resolver.  The private key of the other\n   kind of key pair is used to\
    \ sign the rest of the zone's data sets.\n   The former key pair is called a key-signing\
    \ key (KSK) and the latter\n   is called a zone-signing key (ZSK).  In practice\
    \ there have been\n   usually one of each kind of key pair, but there will be\
    \ multiples of\n   each at times.\n   It should be noted that division of keys\
    \ pairs into KSK's and ZSK's\n   is not mandatory in any definition of DNSSEC,\
    \ not even with the\n   introduction of the DS RR.  But, in testing, this distinction\
    \ has\n   been helpful when designing key roll over (key super-cession)\n   schemes.\
    \  Given that the distinction has proven helpful, the labels\n   KSK and ZSK have\
    \ begun to stick.\n   There is a need to differentiate the public keys for the\
    \ key pairs\n   that are used for key signing from keys that are not used key\
    \ signing\n   (KSKs vs ZSKs).  This need is driven by knowing which DNSKEYs are\
    \ to\n   be sent for generating DS RRs, which DNSKEYs are to be distributed to\n\
    \   resolvers, and which keys are fed to the signer application at the\n   appropriate\
    \ time.\n   In other words, the SEP bit provides an in-band method to communicate\n\
    \   a DNSKEY RR's intended use to third parties.  As an example we\n   present\
    \ 3 use cases in which the bit is useful:\n      The parent is a registry, the\
    \ parent and the child use secured DNS\n      queries and responses, with a preexisting\
    \ trust-relation, or plain\n      DNS over a secured channel to exchange the child's\
    \ DNSKEY RR sets.\n      Since a DNSKEY RR set will contain a complete DNSKEY\
    \ RRset the SEP\n      bit can be used to isolate the DNSKEYs for which a DS RR\
    \ needs to\n      be created.\n      An administrator has configured a DNSKEY\
    \ as root for a trusted\n      subtree into security aware resolver.  Using a\
    \ special purpose\n      tool that queries for the KEY RRs from that domain's\
    \ apex, the\n      administrator will be able to notice the roll over of the trusted\n\
    \      anchor by a change of the subset of KEY RRs with the DS flag set.\n   \
    \   A signer might use the SEP bit on the public key to determine\n      which\
    \ private key to use to exclusively sign the DNSKEY RRset and\n      which private\
    \ key to use to sign the other RRsets in the zone.\n   As demonstrated in the\
    \ above examples it is important to be able to\n   differentiate the SEP keys\
    \ from the other keys in a DNSKEY RR set in\n   the flow between signer and (parental)\
    \ key-collector and in the flow\n   between the signer and the resolver configuration.\
    \  The SEP flag is\n   to be of no interest to the flow between the verifier and\
    \ the\n   authoritative data store.\n   The reason for the term \"SEP\" is a result\
    \ of the observation that the\n   distinction between KSK and ZSK key pairs is\
    \ made by the signer, a\n   key pair could be used as both a KSK and a ZSK at\
    \ the same time.  To\n   be clear, the term SEP was coined to lessen the confusion\
    \ caused by\n   the overlap.  (Once this label was applied, it had the side effect\
    \ of\n   removing the temptation to have both a KSK flag bit and a ZSK flag\n\
    \   bit.)\n   The key words \"MAY\",\"MAY NOT\", \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    ,\n   \"RECOMMENDED\", \"SHOULD\", and \"SHOULD NOT\" in this document are to\
    \ be\n   interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].\n"

- title: 3.  DNSSEC Protocol Changes
  contents:
  - "3.  DNSSEC Protocol Changes\n   The bit MUST NOT be used during the resolving\
    \ and verification\n   process.  The SEP flag is only used to provide a hint about\
    \ the\n   different administrative properties of the key and therefore the use\n\
    \   of the SEP flag does not change the DNS resolution protocol or the\n   resolution\
    \ process.\n"
- title: 4.  Operational Guidelines
  contents:
  - "4.  Operational Guidelines\n   The SEP bit is set by the key-pair-generator and\
    \ MAY be used by the\n   zone signer to decide whether the public part of the\
    \ key pair is to\n   be prepared for input to a DS RR generation function.  The\
    \ SEP bit is\n   recommended to be set (to 1) whenever the public key of the key\
    \ pair\n   will be distributed to the parent zone to build the authentication\n\
    \   chain or if the public key is to be distributed for static\n   configuration\
    \ in verifiers.\n   When a key pair is created, the operator needs to indicate\
    \ whether\n   the SEP bit is to be set in the DNSKEY RR.  As the SEP bit is within\n\
    \   the data that is used to compute the 'key tag field' in the SIG RR,\n   changing\
    \ the SEP bit will change the identity of the key within DNS.\n   In other words,\
    \ once a key is used to generate signatures, the\n   setting of the SEP bit is\
    \ to remain constant.  If not, a verifier\n   will not be able to find the relevant\
    \ KEY RR.\n   When signing a zone, it is intended that the key(s) with the SEP\
    \ bit\n   set (if such keys exist) are used to sign the KEY RR set of the zone.\n\
    \   The same key can be used to sign the rest of the zone data too.  It\n   is\
    \ conceivable that not all keys with a SEP bit set will sign the\n   DNSKEY RR\
    \ set, such keys might be pending retirement or not yet in\n   use.\n   When verifying\
    \ a RR set, the SEP bit is not intended to play a role.\n   How the key is used\
    \ by the verifier is not intended to be a\n   consideration at key creation time.\n\
    \   Although the SEP flag provides a hint on which public key is to be\n   used\
    \ as trusted root, administrators can choose to ignore the fact\n   that a DNSKEY\
    \ has its SEP bit set or not when configuring a trusted\n   root for their resolvers.\n\
    \   Using the SEP flag a key roll over can be automated.  The parent can\n   use\
    \ an existing trust relation to verify DNSKEY RR sets in which a\n   new DNSKEY\
    \ RR with the SEP flag appears.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   As stated in Section 3 the flag is not to be\
    \ used in the resolution\n   protocol or to determine the security status of a\
    \ key.  The flag is\n   to be used for administrative purposes only.\n   No trust\
    \ in a key should be inferred from this flag - trust MUST be\n   inferred from\
    \ an existing chain of trust or an out-of-band exchange.\n   Since this flag might\
    \ be used for automating public key exchanges, we\n   think the following consideration\
    \ is in place.\n   Automated mechanisms for roll over of the DS RR might be vulnerable\n\
    \   to a class of replay attacks.  This might happen after a public key\n   exchange\
    \ where a DNSKEY RR set, containing two DNSKEY RRs with the\n   SEP flag set,\
    \ is sent to the parent.  The parent verifies the DNSKEY\n   RR set with the existing\
    \ trust relation and creates the new DS RR\n   from the DNSKEY RR that the current\
    \ DS RR is not pointing to.  This\n   key exchange might be replayed.  Parents\
    \ are encouraged to implement\n   a replay defense.  A simple defense can be based\
    \ on a registry of\n   keys that have been used to generate DS RRs during the\
    \ most recent\n   roll over.  These same considerations apply to entities that\n\
    \   configure keys in resolvers.\n"
