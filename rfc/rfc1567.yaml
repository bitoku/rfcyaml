- title: 1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework\n   The major components of the SNMPv2\
    \ Network Management framework  are\n   described in the documents listed below.\n\
    \      o RFC 1442 [1] defines the Structure of Management Information\n      \
    \  (SMI), the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects\n        for the\
    \ purpose of management.\n      o STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] defines MIB-II, the core\
    \ set of managed\n        objects (MO) for the Internet suite of protocols.\n\
    \      o RFC 1445 [3] defines the administrative and other\n        architectural\
    \ aspects of the management framework.\n      o RFC 1448 [4] defines the protocol\
    \ used for network access to\n        managed objects.\n   The framework is adaptable/extensible\
    \ by defining new MIBs to suit\n   the requirements of specific applications/protocols/situations.\n\
    \   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, the\n   MIB.\
    \  Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract\n   Syntax Notation\
    \ One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI. In particular, each\n   object type is named\
    \ by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, which is an\n   administratively assigned name. The\
    \ object type together with an\n   object instance serves to uniquely identify\
    \ a specific instantiation\n   of the object. For human convenience, often a textual\
    \ string, termed\n   the descriptor, is used to refer to the object type.\n"
- title: 2.  MIB Model for DSA Management
  contents:
  - "2.  MIB Model for DSA Management\n   A DSA-manager may wish to monitor several\
    \ aspects of the operational\n   DSA.  He/she may want to know the process related\
    \ aspects-the\n   resource utilization of the operational DSA; the network service\n\
    \   related aspects e.g., inbound-associations, outbound-associations,\n   operational\
    \ status, and finally the information specific to the DSA\n   application - its\
    \ operations and performance.\n   The MIB defined in this document covers the\
    \ portion which is specific\n   to the DSA-application. The network service related\
    \ part of the MIB,\n   and the host-resources related part of the MIB, as well\
    \ other parts\n   of interest to a Manager monitoring the DSA-application, are\
    \ covered\n   in separate documents [6] [7].\n"
- title: 3.  The DSA functions and operations
  contents:
  - "3.  The DSA functions and operations\n   The Directory System Agent [DSA], a\
    \ component of the OSI-Directory\n   [5] [9], is an application process. It provides\
    \ access to the\n   Directory Information Base [DIB] to Directory User Agents\
    \ [DUA]\n   and/or other DSAs.  Functionally , a User [DUA] and the Directory\
    \ are\n   bound together for a period of time at an access point to the\n   Directory\
    \ [DSA].  A DSA may use information stored in its local\n   database or interact\
    \ with (chain the request to) other DSAs to\n   service requirements.  Alternatively,\
    \ a DSA may return a reference to\n   another DSA.\n   The local database of a\
    \ DSA consists of the part of the DIT that is\n   mastered by the DSA, the part\
    \ of the DIT for which it keeps slave\n   copies and cached information that is\
    \ gathered during the operation\n   of the DSA.\n   The specific operations carried\
    \ out by the DSA are: Read, Compare,\n   AddEntry, ModifyEntry, ModifyRDN, RemoveEntry,\
    \ List, Search. There is\n   also the special operation Abandon.  In response\
    \ to requests results\n   and/or errors are returned by the DSA.\n"
- title: 4.  MIB design
  contents:
  - "4.  MIB design\n   The basic principle has been to keep the MIB as simple as\
    \ possible.\n   The Managed objects included in the MIB are divided into three\
    \ tables\n   - dsaOpsTable, dsaEntryTable and dsaIntTable.\n      - The dsaOpsTable\
    \ provides summary statistics on the accesses,\n        operations and errors.\n\
    \      - The dsaEntriesTable provides summary statistics on the entries\n    \
    \    held by the DSA and on cache performance.\n      - The dsaIntTable provides\
    \ some useful information on the\n        interaction of the monitored DSA with\
    \ peer DSAs.\n   There are references to the Directory itself for static information\n\
    \   pertaining to the DSA. These references are in the form of \"Directory\n \
    \  Distinguished Name\" [8] of the corresponding object.  It is intended\n   that\
    \ DSA management applications will use these references to obtain\n   further\
    \ related information on the objects of interest.\n"
