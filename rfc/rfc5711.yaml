  - "1.  Introduction\n   The aim of this document is to describe a common practice\
    \ with regard\n   to the behavior of a node sending a Resource Reservation Protocol\n\
    \   (RSVP) Traffic Engineering (TE) Path Error message and to the\n   behavior\
    \ of a node receiving an RSVP Path Error message for a\n   preempted Multiprotocol\
    \ Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS\n   (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering\
    \ Label Switched Path (TE LSP).  (For\n   reference to the notion of TE LSP preemption,\
    \ see [RFC3209]).\n   [RFC2205] defines two RSVP error message types: PathErr\
    \ and ResvErr\n   that are generated when an error occurs.  Path Error messages\n\
    \   (PathErr) are used to report errors and travel upstream toward the\n   head-end\
    \ of the flow.  Resv Error messages (ResvErr) travel\n   downstream toward the\
    \ tail-end of the flow.\n   This document describes only PathErr message processing\
    \ for the\n   specific case of a preempted TE LSP, where the term preemption is\n\
    \   defined in [RFC3209].\n"

    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Protocol Behavior
  contents:
  - "2.  Protocol Behavior\n   PathErr messages are routed hop-by-hop using the path\
    \ state\n   established when a Path message is routed through the network from\n\
    \   the head-end to its tail-end.\n   As stated in [RFC2205], PathErr messages\
    \ do not modify the state of\n   any node through which they pass; they are only\
    \ reported to the head-\n   end of the TE LSP (Traffic Engineering Label Switched\
    \ Path).\n   The format of the PathErr message is defined in Section 3. of\n \
    \  [RFC2205].\n   The ERROR_SPEC object includes the IP address of the node that\n\
    \   detected the error (Error Node Address), and specifies the error\n   through\
    \ two fields.  The Error Code field encodes the category of the\n   error, for\
    \ example, Policy Control Failure or Unknown object class.\n   The Error Value\
    \ field qualifies the error code to indicate the error\n   with more precision.\
    \  [RFC3209] extends RSVP as defined in [RFC2205]\n   for the management of MPLS-TE\
    \ LSPs.  [RFC3209] specifies several\n   additional conditions that trigger the\
    \ sending of a RSVP PathErr\n   message for which new error codes and error values\
    \ have been defined\n   that extend the list defined in [RFC2205].  The exact\
    \ circumstances\n   under which a TE LSP is preempted and such PathErr messages\
    \ are sent\n   are defined in [RFC3209] and will not be repeated here.\n   Values\
    \ for the Error Code and Error Value fields defined in\n   [RFC2205], [RFC3209],\
    \ and other documents are maintained in a\n   registry by the IANA.\n   The error\
    \ conditions fall into two categories:\n   o  Fatal errors represent disruptive\
    \ conditions for a TE LSP.\n   o  Non-fatal errors are non-disruptive conditions\
    \ that have occurred\n      for this TE LSP.\n   PathErr messages may be used\
    \ in two circumstances:\n   o  during TE LSP establishment, and\n   o  after a\
    \ TE LSP has been successfully established.\n   Nodal behavior is dependent on\
    \ which combination of the four cases\n   listed above applies.  The following\
    \ sections describe the expected\n   behavior at nodes that perform a preemption\
    \ action for a TE LSP (and\n   therefore report using error PathErr messages),\
    \ and at nodes that\n   receive PathErr messages.  This text is a clarification\
    \ and\n   restatement of the procedures set out in [RFC3209] and does not\n  \
    \ define any new behavior.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Behavior at Detecting Nodes
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Behavior at Detecting Nodes\n   In the case of fatal errors (\"Hard Preemption\"\
    ; see Section 4.7.3 of\n   [RFC3209] ), the detecting node MUST send a PathErr\
    \ message reporting\n   the error condition, and MUST clear the corresponding\
    \ Path and Resv\n   (control plane) states.  A direct implication is that the\
    \ data-plane\n   resources of such a TE LSP are also released, thus resulting\
    \ in\n   traffic disruption.  It should be noted, however, that in fatal error\n\
    \   cases, the LSP has usually already failed in the data plane, and\n   traffic\
    \ has already been disrupted.  When the error arises during LSP\n   establishment,\
    \ the implications are different to when it arises on an\n   active LSP since\
    \ no traffic flows until the LSP has been fully\n   established.  In the case\
    \ of non-fatal errors, the detecting node\n   should send a PathErr message, and\
    \ must not clear control plane or\n   data plane state.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Behavior at Receiving Nodes
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Behavior at Receiving Nodes\n   Nodes that receive PathErr messages are\
    \ all of the nodes along the\n   path of the TE LSP upstream of the node that\
    \ detected the error.\n   This includes the head-end node.  In accordance with\
    \ Section 3.7.1 of\n   [RFC2205], a node receiving a PathErr message takes no\
    \ action upon\n   it, and consequently the node must not clear Path or Resv control-\n\
    \   plane or data-plane state.  This is true regardless of whether the\n   error\
    \ condition reported by the PathErr is fatal or non-fatal.  RSVP\n   states should\
    \ only be affected upon receiving a PathTear or ResvTear\n   message, or in the\
    \ event of a Path or Resv state timeout.  Further\n   discussion of the processing\
    \ of these events is outside the scope of\n   this document.\n   Note that [RFC3473]\
    \ defines a Path_State_Removed flag in the\n   ERROR_SPEC object carried on a\
    \ PathErr message.  This field may be\n   set to change the behavior of upstream\
    \ nodes that receive the PathErr\n   message.  When set, the flag indicates that\
    \ the message sender has\n   removed Path state (and any associated Resv and data-plane\
    \ state) for\n   the TE LSP.  The message receiver should do likewise before\n\
    \   forwarding the message, but may retain state and clear the flag\n   before\
    \ forwarding the message.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Data-Plane Behavior
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Data-Plane Behavior\n   Any node clearing either or both the Path or the\
    \ Resv state of a TE\n   LSP MUST also free up the data-plane resources allocated\
    \ to the\n   corresponding TE LSP.\n"
- title: 3.  RSVP PathErr Messages for a Preempted TE LSP
  contents:
  - "3.  RSVP PathErr Messages for a Preempted TE LSP\n   Two Error Codes have been\
    \ defined to report a preempted TE LSP:\n   o  As defined in [RFC2750]: Error\
    \ Code=2: \"Policy Control Failure\",\n      Error Value=5: \"Flow was preempted\"\
    \n   o  As defined in [RFC2205], Error Code=12: \"Service preempted\"\n   They\
    \ are both fatal errors.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not define any new procedures,\
    \ but clarifies those\n   defined in other documents where security considerations\
    \ are already\n   specified in [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].  This document does not\
    \ raise\n   specific security issues beyond those of existing MPLS-TE.  By\n \
    \  clarifying the procedures, this document reduces the security risk\n   introduced\
    \ by non-conformant implementations.  See [SEC_FMWK] for\n   further discussion\
    \ of MPLS security issues.\n"
