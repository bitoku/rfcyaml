  - "1.  Introduction\n   A security label, sometimes referred to as a confidentiality\
    \ label,\n   is a structured representation of the sensitivity of a piece of\n\
    \   information.  A security label can be used in conjunction with a\n   clearance,\
    \ a structured representation of what sensitive information\n   a person (or other\
    \ entity) is authorized to access, and a security\n   policy to control access\
    \ to each piece of information.  For instance,\n   an email message could have\
    \ an \"EXAMPLE CONFIDENTIAL\" label that\n   requires the sender and the receiver\
    \ to have a clearance granting\n   access to information labeled \"EXAMPLE CONFIDENTIAL\"\
    .  X.841 [X.841]\n   provides a discussion of security labels, clearances, and\
    \ security\n   policy.\n   A display marking is a textual representation of the\
    \ sensitivity of a\n   piece of information.  For instance, \"EXAMPLE CONFIDENTIAL\"\
    \ is a\n   textual representation of the sensitivity.  A security policy can be\n\
    \   used to generate display markings from security labels.  Display\n   markings\
    \ are generally expected to be prominently displayed whenever\n   the content\
    \ is displayed.\n   Sensitivity-based authorization is used in networks that operate\n\
    \   under a set of information classification rules, such as in\n   government\
    \ and military agency networks.  The standardized formats\n   for security labels,\
    \ clearances, security policy, and associated\n   authorization models are generalized\
    \ and can be used in non-\n   government deployments where appropriate.\n   Security\
    \ labels may also be used for purposes other than\n   authorization.  In particular,\
    \ they may be used simply to convey the\n   sensitivity of a piece information.\
    \  The security label could be\n   used, for instance, to organize content in\
    \ a content store.\n   This document describes a protocol for conveying the sensitivity\
    \ of a\n   electronic mail message [RFC5322] as a whole.  In particular, this\n\
    \   document describes a header field, SIO-Label, that carries a security\n  \
    \ label, a display marking, and display colors.  This document also\n   describes\
    \ a header field, SIO-Label-History, that records changes in\n   the message's\
    \ security label.\n   This protocol is based in part upon \"XEP-0258: Security\
    \ Labels in\n   XMPP\" [XEP258].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Relationship to Inline Sensitivity Markings
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Relationship to Inline Sensitivity Markings\n   In environments requiring\
    \ messages to be marked with an indication of\n   their sensitivity, it is common\
    \ to place a textual representation of\n   the sensitivity, a display marking,\
    \ within the body to the message\n   and/or in the Subject header field.  For\
    \ instance, the authors often\n   receives messages of the form:\n   To: author\
    \ <author@example.com>;\n   From: Some One <someone@example.net>;\n   Subject:\
    \ the subject (UNCLASSIFIED)\n   UNCLASSIFIED\n   Text of the message.\n   UNCLASSIFIED\n\
    \   Typically, when placed in the body of the message, the marking is\n   inserted\
    \ into the content such that it appears as the first line(s)\n   of text in the\
    \ body of the message.  This is known as a FLOT (First\n   Line(s) of Text) marking.\
    \  The marking may or may not be surrounded\n   by other text indicating that\
    \ the marking denotes the sensitivity of\n   the message.  A FLOT may also be\
    \ accompanied by a LLOT (Last Line(s)\n   of Text) marking.  The message above\
    \ contains a two-line FLOT and a\n   two-line LLOT (in both cases, a line providing\
    \ the marking and an\n   empty line between the marking and the original content\
    \ appear).\n   Typically, when placed in the Subject of the message, the marking\
    \ is\n   inserted before or after the contents of the original Subject field;\n\
    \   it is surrounded by parentheses or the like and/or separated from the\n  \
    \ content by white space.\n   The particular syntax and semantics of inline sensitivity\
    \ markings\n   are generally a local matter.  This hinders interoperability within\n\
    \   an organization wanting to take actions based upon these markings and\n  \
    \ hinders interoperability between cooperating organizations wanting to\n   usefully\
    \ share sensitivity information\n   The authors expect that such markings will\
    \ continue to be widely\n   used, especially in the absence of ubiquitous support\
    \ for a\n   standardized header field indicating the sensitivity of the message.\n\
    \   The authors hope that through the use of a formally specified header\n   field,\
    \ interoperability within organizations and between\n   organizations can be improved.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Relationship to Preexisting Security Label Header Fields
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Relationship to Preexisting Security Label Header Fields\n   A number of\
    \ non-standard header fields, such as the X-X411 field, are\n   used to carry\
    \ a representation of the sensitivity of the message,\n   whether a structured\
    \ representation or textual representation.\n   The authors hope that the use\
    \ of preexisting (non-standard) header\n   fields will be replaced, over time,\
    \ with the use of the header field\n   described in this document.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Relationship to Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Relationship to Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME\n   Enhanced Security\
    \ Services for S/MIME (ESS) [RFC2634] provides,\n   amongst other services, signature\
    \ services \"for content integrity,\n   non-repudiation with the proof of origin,\
    \ and [securely] binding\n   attributes (such as a security label) to the original\
    \ content\".\n   While it may be possible to utilize the protocol described in\
    \ this\n   document concurrently with ESS, this protocol should generally be\n\
    \   viewed as an alternative to ESS.\n   It is noted that in ESS, the security\
    \ label applies to MIME [RFC2045]\n   content, where in this protocol, the label\
    \ applies to the message as\n   a whole.\n   It is also noted that in ESS, security\
    \ labels are securely bound to\n   the MIME content through the use of digital\
    \ signatures.  This\n   protocol does not provide message-signing services and\
    \ hence does not\n   provide secure binding the label to the message, content\
    \ integrity,\n   or non-repudiation of the proof of origin.\n   This protocol\
    \ is designed for situations/environments where message\n   signing is not necessary\
    \ to provide sufficient security.\n"

- title: 3.  Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview\n   A Mail User Agent (MUA) originating a message can, if so configured,\n\
    \   offer the user a menu of sensitivities to choose from and, upon\n   selection,\
    \ insert the display marking, foreground and background\n   colors, and security\
    \ label parameters associated with that selection\n   into the SIO-Label header\
    \ field of the message.\n   Mail Submission Agents (MSAs), Mail Transfer Agents\
    \ (MTAs), and Mail\n   Delivery Agents (MDAs) can then, if so configured, use\
    \ the provided\n   sensitivity information (or lack thereof) in determining whether\
    \ to\n   accept, forward, or otherwise act on the message as submitted.  These\n\
    \   agents, hereafter referred to as Service Agents (SAs), can, if so\n   configured,\
    \ modify the sensitivity information of the message, such\n   as replacing the\
    \ security label and/or display marking with\n   equivalent representations of\
    \ the sensitivity of the message.  SAs\n   that add, modify, or delete the SIO-Label\
    \ header field SHOULD add an\n   SIO-Label-History header.\n   Receiving MUAs\
    \ that implement this extension SHALL, when displaying\n   the message, also prominently\
    \ display the marking, if any, conveyed\n   in the SIO-Label header field or,\
    \ if policy-aware and configured to\n   display locally generated markings, a\
    \ marking generated by the\n   conveyed label and the governing policy.  It is\
    \ also desirable to\n   display this marking in listings of messages.  In the\
    \ case the\n   conveyed marking is displayed, the marking SHOULD be displayed\
    \ using\n   the foreground and background colors conveyed in the header field.\n\
    \   In the case the marking was generated from a conveyed label and the\n   governing\
    \ policy, the marking SHOULD be displayed using the\n   foreground and background\
    \ colors conveyed by the governing policy.\n   While MUAs are not expected to\
    \ make authorization decisions based\n   upon values of the SIO-Label header field,\
    \ MUAs can otherwise use the\n   provided sensitivity information (or lack thereof)\
    \ in determining how\n   to act on the message.  For instance, the MUA may organize\
    \ messages\n   in its store of messages based upon the content of this header\
    \ field.\n"
- title: 4.  The SIO-Label Header Field
  contents:
  - "4.  The SIO-Label Header Field\n   The header field name is \"SIO-Label\", and\
    \ its content is a set of\n   key/value pairs, each referred to as a parameter.\n\
    \   Formal header field syntax:\n   sio-label = \"SIO-Label:\" [FWS] sio-label-parm-seq\
    \ [FWS] CRLF\n   sio-label-parm-seq = sio-label-parm\n       [ [FWS] \";\" [FWS]\
    \ sio-label-parm-seq ]\n   sio-label-parm = parameter\n   where the parameter\
    \ production is defined in [RFC2231], the FWS\n   production is defined in [RFC5322],\
    \ and the CRLF production is\n   defined in [RFC5234].  It is noted that the productions\
    \ defined in\n   [RFC2231] rely on the ABNF in [RFC0822], which implicitly allows\
    \ for\n   white space in certain cases.  In particular, white space is\n   implicitly\
    \ allowed in the parameter production immediately before and\n   after the \"\
    =\".  It is also noted that [RFC2231] allows for quoted-\n   string values (for\
    \ parameter production) of substantial length, for\n   string characters outside\
    \ of US-ASCII, or for other such cases.\n   Implementors should consult the referenced\
    \ specifications for\n   details.\n   The \"marking\" parameter is a display string\
    \ for use by\n   implementations that are unable or unwilling to utilize the governing\n\
    \   security policy to generate display markings.  The \"marking\"\n   parameter\
    \ SHOULD generally be provided in SIO-Label header fields.\n   It ought only be\
    \ absent where an SA relies on other SAs to generate\n   the marking.\n   The\
    \ \"fgcolor\" and \"bgcolor\" parameters are tokens restricted to color\n   production\
    \ representing the foreground and background colors,\n   respectively, for use\
    \ in colorizing the display marking string.\n   Their values are RGB colors in\
    \ hexadecimal format (e.g., \"#ff0000\"),\n   or one of the Cascading Style Sheets\
    \ (CSS) color names (e.g., \"red\")\n   given in named-color type below (the 16\
    \ HTML4 colors + \"orange\")\n   [CSS3-Color].  The default foreground color is\
    \ black.  The default\n   background is white.  The \"fgcolor\" and \"bgcolor\"\
    \ parameters SHALL be\n   absent if the \"marking\" parameter is absent.  The\
    \ HEXDIG production\n   below is defined in [RFC5234].\n   Formal color syntax:\n\
    \   color = hex-color / named-color\n   hex-color = \"#\" 6HEXDIG    ; Hex-encoded\
    \ RGB\n   named-color =\n              \"aqua\" /\n              \"black\" /\n\
    \              \"blue\" /\n              \"fuschia\" /\n              \"gray\"\

    \ /\n              \"white\" /\n              \"yellow\" /\n              \"orange\"\
    \ ; named colors\n   The \"type\" parameter is a quoted string containing the\
    \ string \":ess\",\n   the string \":x411\", the string \":xml\", or a URI [RFC3986]\
    \ denoting\n   the type and encoding of the \"label\" parameter.  The \"label\"\
    \n   parameter value is a quoted string.  The \"type\" parameter SHALL be\n  \
    \ present if the \"label\" parameter is present.  The \"label\" parameter\n  \
    \ SHALL be present if the \"type\" parameter is present.  When\n   sensitivity-based\
    \ authorization is performed, the absence of the\n   \"type\" and \"label\" parameters\
    \ indicates that the message is handled\n   under default handling rules (e.g.,\
    \ as if no SIO-Label was present).\n   The string \":ess\" indicates that the\
    \ \"label\" parameter value is the\n   base64 encoding of the BER encoding of\
    \ an ESS security label\n   [RFC2634].\n   ESS Label Example:\n   SIO-Label: marking=\"\

    \ [XML].  The XML\n   prolog SHOULD be absent unless specifically required (such\
    \ as when\n   the character encoding is not UTF-8).  The particular flavor of\n\

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Sensitive information should be appropriately\
    \ protected (whether\n   labeled or not).  For email messages, it is generally\
    \ appropriate for\n   the sending entity to authenticate the receiving entity\
    \ and to\n   establish transport-level security, including protective services\
    \ for\n   both data integrity and data confidentiality.  When a receiving\n  \
    \ entity makes authorization decisions based upon assertions of the\n   sending\
    \ entity, including assertions of identity, it is generally\n   appropriate for\
    \ the receiving entity to authenticate the sending\n   entity.\n   This document\
    \ provides a facility for expressing the sensitivity of\n   an email message.\
    \  The mere expression of actual sensitivity\n   generally does not elevate the\
    \ sensitivity of the message; however,\n   expressions of sensitivities can themselves\
    \ be regarded as sensitive\n   information.  For instance, a marking of \"BLACK\
    \ PROJECT RESTRICTED\"\n   could disclose the existence of a sensitivity project.\n\
    \   The SIO-Label header field expresses the sensitivity of the whole\n   message,\
    \ including the header and body.  This document does not\n   provide a means to\
    \ express the sensitivity of portions of an email\n   message, such as the possibly\
    \ different sensitivities of various MIME\n   parts that the message may be composed\
    \ of.  The approach used in this\n   document favors simplicity and ease of use\
    \ (i.e., a single expression\n   of sensitivity) over the complexity and difficulty\
    \ of marking and\n   labeling portions of a message.\n   The expressed sensitivity\
    \ can be used in determining how to handle a\n   message.  For instance, the value\
    \ of the SIO-Label header field (or\n   lack thereof) can be used to determine\
    \ if it is appropriate to be\n   forwarded to a particular entity and, if so,\
    \ what minimum security\n   services ought to be used in the forwarding exchange.\
    \  The mechanism\n   for determining how to handle a message-based expressed sensitivity\n\
    \   is beyond the scope of this document.\n   The actual content may have more\
    \ or less sensitivity than indicated\n   by the security label.  Agents should\
    \ avoid lowering security\n   requirements for message exchange with a particular\
    \ entity based upon\n   conveyed sensitivity.\n   This protocol does not itself\
    \ provide message-signing services, such\n   as used in providing message integrity\
    \ protection, non-repudiation,\n   and binding of attributes (such as the security\
    \ label to the\n   message).  While it possible that this protocol could be used\
    \ with a\n   general message-signing service, this document does not detail such\n\
    \   use.\n   While security label and display marking parameters are expected\
    \ to\n   express the same sensitivity, nothing in this specification ensures\n\
    \   that the security label and display marking values express the same\n   sensitivity.\
    \  For instance, an MUA could submit a message that\n   contains a security label\
    \ that expresses one sensitivity and a\n   display marking with a different sensitivity,\
    \ and by doing so,\n   possibly cause an SA to inappropriately handle the message.\
    \  It is\n   generally appropriate for each SA using the SIO-Label values to\n\
    \   determine if the security label and display marking values express\n   the\
    \ same sensitivity and, if not, take appropriate action (such as\n   rejecting\
    \ the message).\n   This document also provides a facility for expressing changes\
    \ to the\n   label of a message.  This is intended to be used for trace purposes\n\
    \   only.  It is noted that the SIO-Label-History header field can\n   include\
    \ sensitive information and, as such, can be removed from the\n   message when\
    \ its inclusion would result in disclosure of\n   inappropriate information.\n"
