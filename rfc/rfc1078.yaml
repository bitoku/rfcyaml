- title: Status of this Memo
  contents:
  - "Status of this Memo\n   This RFC proposes an Internet standard which can be used\
    \ by future\n   TCP services instead of using 'well-known ports'.  Distribution\
    \ of\n   this memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: Overview
  contents:
  - "Overview\n   Ports are used in the TCP to name the ends of logical connections\n\
    \   which carry long term conversations.  For the purpose of providing\n   services\
    \ to unknown callers, a service contact port is defined.  The\n   contact port\
    \ is sometimes called the \"well-known port\".  Standard TCP\n   services are\
    \ assigned unique well-known port numbers in the range of\n   0-255.  These ports\
    \ are of limited number and are typically only\n   assigned to official Internet\
    \ protocols.\n   This RFC defines a protocol to contact multiple services on a\
    \ single\n   well-known TCP port using a service name instead of a well-known\n\
    \   number.  In addition, private protocols can make use of the service\n   without\
    \ needing an official TCP port assignment.\n"
- title: The Protocol
  contents:
  - "The Protocol\n   A TCP client connects to a foreign host on TCP port 1.  It sends\
    \ the\n   service name followed by a carriage-return line-feed <CRLF>.  The\n\
    \   service name is never case sensitive.  The server replies with a\n   single\
    \ character indicating positive (\"+\") or negative (\"-\")\n   acknowledgment,\
    \ immediately followed by an optional message of\n   explanation, terminated with\
    \ a <CRLF>.  If the reply was positive,\n   the selected protocol begins; otherwise\
    \ the connection is closed.\n"
- title: Service Names
  contents:
  - "Service Names\n   The name \"HELP\" is reserved.  If received, the server will\
    \ output a\n   multi-line message and then close the connection.  The reply to\
    \ the\n   name \"HELP\" must be a list of the service names of the supported\n\
    \   services, one name per line.\n   The names listed in the \"Protocol and Service\
    \ Names\" section of the\n   current edition of \"Assigned Numbers\" (RFC-1010\
    \ at this time) are\n   reserved to have exactly the definitions specified there.\
    \  Services\n   with distinct assigned ports must be available on those ports\
    \ and may\n   optionally be available via this port service multiplexer on port\
    \ 1.\n   Private protocols should use a service name that has a high chance of\n\
    \   being unique.  A good practice is to prefix the protocol name with\n   the\
    \ name of your organization.\n   Multiple versions of a protocol can suffix the\
    \ service name with a\n   protocol version number.\n"
- title: Implementation Notes
  contents:
  - "Implementation Notes\n   A negative reply will typically be returned by the port-multiplexing\n\
    \   process when it can't find the requested service.  A positive reply\n   will\
    \ typically be returned by the process invoked by the port\n   multiplexer for\
    \ the requested service.\n"
