- title: 1a. Background and Purpose
  contents:
  - "1a. Background and Purpose\n   On 1 June 1989, several members of the IETF User\
    \ Services Working\n   Group convened an interim working group session at the\
    \ JVNC\n   Supercomputer Center in Princeton, NJ.  The purpose of the meeting\n\
    \   was to form a distinct working group that would assemble a\n   bibliography\
    \ of useful information about the Internet for end users\n   and for those who\
    \ help end users.  The first official meeting of the\n   User Documents Working\
    \ Group was held at the Stanford IETF in July\n   1989.  The goal of the working\
    \ group was to prepare a bibliography of\n   on-line and hard copy documents,\
    \ reference materials, and multimedia\n   training tools that address general\
    \ networking information and \"how\n   to use the Internet\".  The target audience\
    \ was beginner level and\n   intermediate level end users.\n"
- title: 1b. Scope
  contents:
  - "1b. Scope\n   This bibliography is the result of volunteer work provided by members\n\
    \   of the User Documents Working Group.  The intent of this effort is to\n  \
    \ present a representative collection of materials that will help the\n   reader\
    \ become familiar with the concepts of internetworking and will\n   form the basis\
    \ for future study.  This is, quite simply, a good place\n   to start.  References\
    \ to other sources of information within this\n   collection of materials will\
    \ be useful to readers who wish to pursue,\n   in greater depth, the issues and\
    \ complexities of the current\n   networking environment.  Please send comments\
    \ to us-wg@nnsc.nsf.net.\n"
- title: 1c. Organization of Document
  contents:
  - "1c. Organization of Document\n   This version of the bibliography is divided\
    \ into 10 distinct\n   categories of material, and each category is presented\
    \ in a separate\n   section:\n           2  ARTICLES\n           3  BIBLIOGRAPHIES\n\
    \           4  BOOKS\n           5  CONFERENCES AND WORKSHOPS\n           6  GLOSSARIES\n\
    \           7  GUIDES\n           8  MULTIMEDIA\n           9  NEWSLETTERS\n \
    \          10 REPORTS AND PAPERS\n           11 REQUESTS FOR COMMENTS (RFCs)\n\
    \   Within each section, material is arranged in alphabetical order by\n   author\
    \ or authoring organization with the exception of Section 11:\n   REQUESTS FOR\
    \ COMMENTS (RFCs).  The RFCs are ordered numerically.  All\n   entries contain\
    \ fairly standard bibliographic information and provide\n   a short abstract with\
    \ information on how to obtain the particular\n   material addressed.\n   For\
    \ brand new network users, unsure of what to read first, we suggest\n   reading\
    \ Ed Krol's, \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Internet\" (listed\n   in the Guide\
    \ section).  For general information on an introduction to\n   Internet protocols,\
    \ two documents are quite useful: Charles\n   Hedrick's, \"Introduction to the\
    \ Internet Protocols\", and Doug Comer's\n   textbook, \"Internetworking with\
    \ TCP/IP: Principles, Protocols, and\n   Architecture\".  Two excellent guides\
    \ to existing networks are Tracy\n   L.  LaQuey's, \"Users' Directory of Computer\
    \ Networks\" and John S.\n   Quarterman's \"The Matrix: Computer Networks and\
    \ Conferencing Systems\n   Worldwide\".  We strongly encourage the reader to scan\
    \ the\n   bibliography in its entirety as some items may be more applicable to\n\
    \   personal needs or site requirements.  (Please note that in many\n   instances\
    \ the abstracts are excerpts, provided verbatim, from the\n   material described.)\n"
- title: 1d. Obtaining Files By Anonymous FTP
  contents:
  - "1d. Obtaining Files By Anonymous FTP\n   Much of the material referenced in this\
    \ bibliography is available\n   on-line and can be obtained by using the File\
    \ Transfer Protocol\n   (FTP).  Directions on how to obtain on-line files by anonymous\
    \ FTP\n   action follow.  In this example, the host used is nic.ddn.mil.\n   Files\
    \ may be obtained with the FTP program in conjunction with an\n   ANONYMOUS login.\
    \  Versions of the FTP program may vary from system to\n   system, so the commands\
    \ shown in this example may need to be modified\n   to work on your system.\n\
    \       % ftp nic.ddn.mil  <== Use the FTP program to\n                      \
    \                 connect to nic.ddn.mil\n       Connected to nic.ddn.mil\n  \
    \     220 NIC.DDN.MIL FTP Server 5Z(47)-6 at Fri 23-Jun-89 09:38-PDT\n   The system\
    \ should respond with a message to indicate that a\n   connection has been made.\
    \  Users on a Unix system will probably be\n   prompted for a login name.  Type\
    \ in \"anonymous\" as in the example\n   below:\n       Name (nic.ddn.mil:kbowers):\
    \ anonymous\n       331 ANONYMOUS user ok, send real ident as password.\n    \
    \   Password:      <== Type in <guest> at the password prompt\n   Other systems\
    \ may require the use of a \"login\" or \"user\" command to\n   send the username\
    \ to the server computer.  Users unsure of the\n   command should contact a local\
    \ site representative for the specific\n   commands.\n   After the username and\
    \ password are sent to the system, a message to\n   indicate that the login has\
    \ been made successfully should appear:\n       230 User ANONYMOUS logged in at\
    \ Fri 23-Jun-89 09:39-PDT, job 17.\n   The user then connects to the directory\
    \ in which the document to be\n   retrieved resides. This is done with the cd\
    \ command:\n       ftp> cd RFC:\n       331 Default name accepted. Send password\
    \ to connect to it.\n   The user should now be connected to the RFC: directory.\
    \  The \"dir\" or\n   \"ls\" command will list the files available in this directory.\n\
    \       ftp> dir\n       200 Port 4.124 at host 192.33.33.51 accepted.\n     \

    \           should appear **\n       226 Transfer completed.\n   The \"get\" command\
    \ will get any file in the directory.\n       ftp> get RFC821.TXT\n       200\
    \ Port 4.125 at host 192.33.33.51 accepted.\n       150 ASCII retrieve of TS<RFC>RFC.821.TXT.1\

  contents:
  - "11.a The Request for Comments Document Series\n   The RFCs are working notes\
    \ of the Internet research and development\n   community.  A document in this\
    \ series may be on essentially any topic\n   related to computer communication,\
    \ and may be anything from a meeting\n   report to the specification of a standard.\n\
    \   Most RFCs are the descriptions of network protocols or services,\n   often\
    \ giving detailed procedures and formats providing the\n   information necessary\
    \ for creating implementations.  Other RFCs\n   report on the results of policy\
    \ studies or summarize the work of\n   technical committees or workshops.\n  \
    \ Note: Currently, all standards are published as RFCs, but not all\n   RFCs specify\
    \ standards.\n   Anyone can submit a document for publication as an RFC.  Submissions\n\
    \   must be made via electronic mail to the RFC Editor.  The RFC Editor\n   is\
    \ Jon Postel (Postel@ISI.EDU).\n   While RFCs are not refereed publications, they\
    \ do receive technical\n   review from either the task forces, individual technical\
    \ experts, or\n   the RFC Editor, as appropriate.\n   RFCs are distributed on-line\
    \ by being stored as public access files,\n   and a short message is sent to the\
    \ RFC distribution list (RFC-\n   REQUEST@NIC.DDN.MIL) indicating the availability\
    \ of the memo.\n   The on-line files are copied by the interested people and printed\
    \ or\n   displayed at their site on their equipment.  An RFC may also be\n   returned\
    \ via email in response to an email query. RFCs can be\n   obtained via FTP from\
    \ NIC.DDN.MIL, with the pathname RFC:RFCnnnn.TXT\n   (where \"nnnn\" refers to\
    \ the number of the RFC).  Login with FTP,\n   username \"anonymous\", password\
    \ \"guest\".\n   The DDN Network Information Center (NIC) also provides an automatic\n\
    \   mail service for those sites which cannot use FTP.  Address the\n   request\
    \ to SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL and in the subject field of the\n   message indicate\
    \ the RFC number, as in \"Subject: RFC nnnn\".\n   RFCs can also be contained\
    \ via FTP from NIS.NSF.NET.  Using FTP,\n   login with username \"anonymous\"\
    , and password \"guest\"; then connect\n   to the RFC directory (cd RFC).  The\
    \ file name is of the form\n   RFCnnnn.TXT-1 (where \"nnnn\" refers to the number\
    \ of the RFC).\n   The NSFNet Network Information Service (NIS) also provides\
    \ an\n   automatic mail service for those sites which cannot use FTP.  Address\n\
    \   the request to NIS-INFO@NIS.NSF.NET and leave the subject field of\n   the\
    \ message blank.  The first line of the text of the message must be\n   \"SEND\
    \ RFCnnnn.TXT-1\", where \"nnnn\" is replaced by the RFC number.\n   This means\
    \ that the format of the online files must meet the\n   constraints of a wide\
    \ variety of printing and display equipment.\n   Once a document is assigned an\
    \ RFC number and published, that RFC is\n   never revised or re-issued with the\
    \ same number.  There is never a\n   question of having the most recent version\
    \ of a particular RFC.\n   However, a protocol (such as File Transfer Protocol\
    \ (FTP)) may be\n   improved and re-documented many times in several different\
    \ RFCs.  It\n   is important to verify that you have the most recent RFC on a\n\
    \   particular protocol.\n   The Internet Activities Board (IAB) published the\
    \ \"IAB Official\n   Protocol Standards\" (currently RFC-1140), which describes\
    \ the state\n   of standardization of protocols used in the Internet.  This document\n\
    \   is issued quarterly.  Current copies may be obtained from the DDN\n   Network\
    \ Information Center or from the Internet Assigned Numbers\n   Authority.  Please\
    \ refer to the latest edition of the \"IAB Protocol\n   Standards\" RFC for current\
    \ information on the state and status of\n   standard Internet protocols.\n  \
    \ The complete set of all RFCs issued is maintained at, and available\n   from,\
    \ the DDN Network Information Center at SRI International.  For\n   further information,\
    \ phone: 1-800-235-3155 (E-mail: NIC@NIC.DDN.MIL).\n   Subsets of this master\
    \ set (shadow copies) are maintained at MERIT\n   and CSNET.  Use of the RFC repositories\
    \ at these sites may be more\n   suitable to your network connectivity requirements.\
    \  Please note,\n   however, that the NIC.DDN.MIL is the central repository and\
    \ will\n   contain the most up-to-date set of RFCs.\n"

    \ of TCP/IP-based Internets\n      A Recommended Standard.  This RFC provides\
    \ the initial version of\n      the Management Information Base (MIB) for use\
    \ with network\n      management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets in the short-term.\n\
    \      In particular, together with its companion memos which describe\n     \
    \ the structure of management information along with the initial\n      network\
    \ management protocol, these documents provide a simple,\n      workable architecture\
    \ and system for managing TCP/IP-based\n      internets, and in particular, the\
    \ Internet.  TCP/IP\n      implementations in the Internet which are network manageable\
    \ are\n      expected to adopt and implement this specification.\n"
