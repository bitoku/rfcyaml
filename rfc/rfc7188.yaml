  - "1.  Introduction\n   The MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) [RFC6130]\
    \ and the\n   Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) [RFC7181]\n\
    \   are protocols for use in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) [RFC2501],\n   based\
    \ on the Generalized MANET Packet/Message Format [RFC5444].\n   This document\
    \ updates [RFC6130] and [RFC7181], specifically their use\n   of TLV (Type-Length-Value)\
    \ elements, to increase the extensibility of\n   these protocols and to enable\
    \ some improvements in their\n   implementation.\n   This specification reduces\
    \ the latitude of implementations of\n   [RFC6130] and [RFC7181] to consider some\
    \ messages, which will not be\n   created by implementations simply following\
    \ those specifications, as\n   a reason to consider the message as \"badly formed\"\
    , and thus as a\n   reason to reject the message.  This gives greater latitude\
    \ to the\n   creation of extensions of these protocols, in particular extensions\n\
    \   that will interoperate with unextended implementations of those\n   protocols.\
    \  As part of that, it indicates how TLVs with unexpected\n   value fields must\
    \ be handled, and adds some additional options to\n   those TLVs.\n   Note that\
    \ TLVs with unknown type or type extension are already\n   specified as to be\
    \ ignored by [RFC6130] and [RFC7181] and also are\n   not a reason to reject a\
    \ message.\n"

- title: 3.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "3.  Applicability Statement\n   This document updates the specification of the\
    \ protocols described in\n   [RFC6130] and [RFC7181].\n   Specifically, this specification\
    \ updates [RFC6130] and [RFC7181] in\n   the following ways:\n   o  Removes the\
    \ latitude of rejecting a message with a TLV with a\n      known type, but with\
    \ an unexpected TLV Value field, for the TLV\n      Types defined in [RFC6130]\
    \ and [RFC7181].\n   o  Specifies the handling of a TLV Value field with unexpected\n\
    \      length.\n   o  Sets up IANA registries for TLV Values for the Address Block\
    \ TLVs:\n      *  LOCAL_IF, defined in [RFC6130].\n      *  LINK_STATUS, defined\
    \ in [RFC6130].\n      *  OTHER_NEIGHB, defined in [RFC6130].\n      *  MPR, defined\
    \ in [RFC7181], now considered as a bit field.\n      *  NBR_ADDR_TYPE, defined\
    \ in [RFC7181], now considered as a bit\n         field.\n   o  Defines a well-known\
    \ TLV Value for \"UNSPECIFIED\" for the Address\n      Block TLV Types LOCAL_IF,\
    \ LINK_STATUS, and OTHER_NEIGHB, all\n      defined in [RFC6130].\n"
- title: 4.  TLV Values
  contents:
  - "4.  TLV Values\n   NHDP [RFC6130] and OLSRv2 [RFC7181] define a number of TLVs\
    \ within\n   the framework of [RFC5444].  These TLVs define the meaning of only\n\
    \   some of the contents that can be found in a TLV Value field.  This\n   limitation\
    \ may be either defining only certain TLV Values or\n   considering only some\
    \ lengths of the TLV Value fields (or a single-\n   value field in a multivalue\
    \ Address-Block TLV).  This specification\n   describes how NHDP [RFC6130] and\
    \ OLSRv2 [RFC7181] are to handle TLVs\n   with other TLV Value fields.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Unrecognized TLV Values
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Unrecognized TLV Values\n   NHDP and OLSRv2 specify that, in addition to\
    \ well-defined reasons (in\n   the respective protocol specifications), an implementation\
    \ of these\n   protocols MAY recognize a message as \"badly formed\" and therefore\n\
    \   \"invalid for processing\" for other reasons (Section 12.1 of [RFC6130]\n\
    \   and Section 16.3.1 of [RFC7181]).  These sections could be\n   interpreted\
    \ as allowing rejection of a message because a TLV Value\n   field is unrecognized.\
    \  This specification removes that latitude:\n   o  An implementation MUST NOT\
    \ reject a message because it contains an\n      unrecognized TLV value.  Instead,\
    \ any unrecognized TLV Value field\n      MUST be processed or ignored by an unextended\
    \ implementation of\n      NHDP or OLSRv2, as described in the following sections.\n\
    \   o  Hence, this specification removes the 7th, 10th, and 11th bullets\n   \
    \   in Section 12.1 of [RFC6130].\n   It should be stressed that this is not a\
    \ change to [RFC6130] or\n   [RFC7181], except with regard to not allowing this\
    \ to be a reason for\n   rejection of a message.  [RFC6130] or [RFC7181] are specified\
    \ in\n   terms such as \"if an address is associated with a value of LOST by a\n\
    \   LINK_STATUS TLV\".  Association with an unrecognized value has no\n   effect\
    \ on any implementation strictly following such a specification.\n"
- title: 4.2.  TLV Value Lengths
  contents:
  - "4.2.  TLV Value Lengths\n   The TLVs specified in [RFC6130] and [RFC7181] may\
    \ be either single-\n   value or multivalue TLVs.  In either case, the length\
    \ of each item of\n   information encoded in the TLV Value field is the \"single-length\"\
    ,\n   defined and calculated as in Section 5.4.1 of [RFC5444].  All TLVs\n   specified\
    \ in [RFC6130] and [RFC7181] have a one- or two-octet single-\n   length.  These\
    \ are considered the expected single-lengths of such a\n   received TLV.\n   Other\
    \ single-length TLV Value fields may be introduced by extensions\n   to [RFC6130]\
    \ and [RFC7181].  This document specifies how\n   implementations of [RFC6130]\
    \ and [RFC7181], or extensions thereof,\n   MUST behave on receiving TLVs of the\
    \ TLV types defined in [RFC6130]\n   and [RFC7181], but with TLV Value fields\
    \ with other single-length\n   values.\n   The following principles apply:\n \
    \  o  If the received single-length is greater than the expected single-\n   \
    \   length, then the excess octets MUST be ignored.\n   o  If the received single-length\
    \ is less than the expected single-\n      length, then the absent octets MUST\
    \ be considered to have all bits\n      cleared (0).\n   Exception:\n   o  A received\
    \ CONT_SEQ_NUM with a single-length < 2 SHOULD be\n      considered an error.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Undefined TLV Values
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Undefined TLV Values\n   [RFC6130] and [RFC7181] define a number of TLVs,\
    \ but for some of\n   these TLVs they specify meanings for only some TLV Values.\
    \  This\n   document establishes IANA registries for these TLV Values, with\n\
    \   initial registrations reflecting those used by [RFC6130] and\n   [RFC7181],\
    \ and as specified in Section 4.3.3.\n   There are different cases of TLV Values\
    \ with different\n   characteristics.  These cases are considered in this section.\n"
- title: '4.3.1.  NHDP TLVs: LOCAL_IF, LINK_STATUS, and OTHER_NEIGHB'
  contents:
  - "4.3.1.  NHDP TLVs: LOCAL_IF, LINK_STATUS, and OTHER_NEIGHB\n   For the Address-Block\
    \ TLVs LOCAL_IF, LINK_STATUS, and OTHER_NEIGHB\n   TLVs, defined in [RFC6130],\
    \ only a limited number of values are\n   specified for each.  These are converted,\
    \ by this specification, into\n   extensible registries with initial registrations\
    \ for values defined\n   and used by [RFC6130] -- see Section 5.\n   An implementation\
    \ of [RFC6130] that receives a LOCAL_IF, LINK_STATUS,\n   or OTHER_NEIGHB TLV\
    \ with any TLV Value other than the values that are\n   defined in [RFC6130] MUST\
    \ ignore that TLV Value, as well as any\n   corresponding attribute association\
    \ to the address.\n"
- title: '4.3.2.  OLSRv2 TLVs: MPR and NBR_ADDR_TYPE'
  contents:
  - "4.3.2.  OLSRv2 TLVs: MPR and NBR_ADDR_TYPE\n   The Address-Block TLVs MPR and\
    \ NBR_ADDR_TYPE, defined in [RFC7181],\n   are similar to those defined in [RFC6130]\
    \ in having only limited\n   values specified (1, 2, and 3): 1 and 2 represent\
    \ the presence of two\n   different attributes associated to an address, and 3\
    \ represents \"both\n   1 and 2\".\n   These TLV Value fields are, by this specification,\
    \ converted to bit\n   fields and MUST be interpreted as such.  As the existing\
    \ definitions\n   of values 1, 2, and 3 behave in that manner, it is likely that\
    \ this\n   will involve no change to an implementation, but any test of (for\n\
    \   example) Value = 1 or Value = 3 MUST be converted to a test of (for\n   example)\
    \ Value bitand 1 = 1, where \"bitand\" denotes a bitwise AND\n   operation.\n\
    \   This specification creates registries for recording reservations of\n   the\
    \ individual bits in these bit fields, with initial registrations\n   for values\
    \ defined and used by [RFC7181] -- see Section 5.\n   Other TLVs defined by [RFC7181]\
    \ are not affected by this\n   specification.\n"
- title: 4.3.3.  Unspecified TLV Values
  contents:
  - "4.3.3.  Unspecified TLV Values\n   The registries defined in Section 5 for the\
    \ LOCAL_IF, LINK_STATUS,\n   and OTHER_NEIGHB TLVs each include an additional\
    \ TLV Value\n   UNSPECIFIED.  This TLV Value represents a defined value that,\
    \ like\n   currently undefined TLV Values, indicates that no information is\n\
    \   associated with this address; the defined value will always have this\n  \
    \ meaning.  Such a TLV Value may be used to enable the creation of more\n   efficient\
    \ multivalue Address Block TLVs or to simplify an\n   implementation.\n   The\
    \ similar requirement for the MPR and NBR_ADDR_TYPES TLVs is\n   already satisfied\
    \ by the TLV Value zero, provided that each bit in\n   the TLV Value is defined\
    \ as set ('1') when indicating the presence of\n   an attribute, or clear ('0')\
    \ when indicating the absence of an\n   attribute.  Therefore, this is required\
    \ for registrations from the\n   relevant registries; see Section 5.\n   For the\
    \ LINK_METRIC TLV, this is already possible by clearing the\n   most significant\
    \ bits (0 to 3) of the first octet of the TLV Value.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that\
    \ in this case the remaining bits of the TLV\n   Value are either all clear ('0')\
    \ or all set ('1').\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The updates made to [RFC6130] and [RFC7181] have\
    \ the following\n   implications on the security considerations:\n   o  Created\
    \ IANA registries for retaining TLV values for TLVs, already\n      defined in\
    \ the already published specifications of the two\n      protocols, and with initial\
    \ registrations for the TLV values\n      defined by these specifications.  This\
    \ does not give rise to any\n      additional security considerations.\n   o \
    \ Enabled protocol extensions for registering TLV values in the\n      created\
    \ IANA registries.  Such extensions MUST specify appropriate\n      security considerations.\n\
    \   o  Created, in some registries, a registration for \"UNSPECIFIED\"\n     \
    \ values for more efficient use of multivalue Address Block TLVs.\n      The interpretation\
    \ of an address being associated with a TLV of a\n      given type and with the\
    \ value \"UNSPECIFIED\" is identical to that\n      address not being associated\
    \ with a TLV of that type.  Thus, this\n      update does not give rise to any\
    \ additional security\n      considerations.\n   o  Reduced the latitude of implementations\
    \ of the two protocols to\n      reject a message as \"badly formed\" due to the\
    \ value field of a TLV\n      being unexpected.  These protocols are specified\
    \ in terms such as\n      \"if an address is associated with a value of LOST by\
    \ a LINK_STATUS\n      TLV\".  Association with an unknown value (or a value newly\
    \ defined\n      to mean no link status information) has no effect on such a\n\
    \      specification.  Thus, this update does not give rise to any\n      additional\
    \ security considerations.\n   o  Did not introduce any opportunities for attacks\
    \ on the protocols\n      through signal modification that are not already present\
    \ in the\n      two protocols.\n"
