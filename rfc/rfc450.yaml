    \ and in view of the fact that we've found\nan extra bit of budget, the timeout\
    \ on sampling (\"anonymous\") use of\nMultics via the Net has been increased to\
    \ 5 cpu minutes (from 1 cpu\nminute); coupled with various internal speedups,\
    \ this change should\nallow the performance of substantive experiments in a single\
    \ session.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n\
