- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The disclosure process for intellectual property rights\
    \ (IPR) in\n   documents produced within the IETF stream [RFC5741] is essential\
    \ to\n   the efficient and accurate development of community consensus.  In\n\
    \   particular, ensuring that IETF working groups and participants have\n   as\
    \ much information as possible regarding IPR constraints, as early\n   as possible\
    \ in the process, increases the likelihood that the\n   community can develop\
    \ an informed consensus regarding technical\n   proposals.  Statements to that\
    \ effect appear in both the second and\n   third revisions of the Internet Standards\
    \ Process ([RFC1602],\n   Section 5.5, Clause (B) and [RFC2026], Section 10.4,\
    \ Clause (B)).\n   However, sometimes IPR disclosures do not occur at the earliest\n\
    \   possible stage in the IETF process.  There are many reasons why an\n   individual\
    \ might not disclose IPR early in the process: for example,\n   through a simple\
    \ oversight, to introduce delay, or to subvert the\n   emergence of consensus.\n\
    \   Regardless of the cause or motivation, noncompliance with IPR\n   disclosure\
    \ rules can delay or even derail completion of IETF\n   specifications.  Disclosure\
    \ of IPR after significant decisions, such\n   as Working Group Last Call (WGLC),\
    \ might lead to reconsideration of\n   those actions.  As one example, a working\
    \ group (WG) might change\n   course and use a previously rejected technical proposal\
    \ with less\n   onerous licensing requirements.  Such \"course corrections\" produce\n\
    \   unnecessary delays in the standardization process.\n   This document suggests\
    \ some strategies for promoting compliance with\n   the IETF's IPR disclosure\
    \ rules and thereby avoiding such delays.\n   These strategies are primarily intended\
    \ for use by area directors\n   (ADs), WG chairs, and WG secretaries.\n   These\
    \ strategies are focused on promoting early disclosure by\n   document authors,\
    \ since late disclosure involving authors has\n   historically caused significant\
    \ delays in the standardization\n   process.  Many of these strategies also promote\
    \ early disclosure by\n   other IETF contributors.\n   Naturally, even if ADs,\
    \ WG chairs, and WG secretaries do not apply\n   the strategies described in this\
    \ document, IETF contributors are\n   still bound by the rules defined in BCP\
    \ 79 (see [RFC3979] and\n   [RFC4879]) and BCP 78 (see [RFC5378]).  This document\
    \ does not modify\n   those rules, nor does it normatively extend those rules;\
    \ it merely\n   provides suggestions intended to aid ADs, WG chairs, and WG\n\
    \   secretaries.\n   By intent, this document does not claim to define best current\n\
    \   practices; instead, it suggests strategies that ADs, WG chairs, and\n   WG\
    \ secretaries might find useful.  With sufficient use and\n   appropriate modification\
    \ to incorporate the lessons of experience,\n   these strategies might someday\
    \ form the basis for documentation of\n   best current practices.\n   This document\
    \ does not consider the parallel, but important, issue of\n   potential actions\
    \ that can be taken by the IETF itself for lack of\n   conformance with the IETF's\
    \ IPR policy.  That topic is discussed in\n   [RFC6701].\n   At the time of this\
    \ writing, the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF)\n   follows the same IPR disclosure\
    \ rules as the IETF (see\n   <http://irtf.org/ipr>); therefore, the strategies\
    \ described here\n   might also be appropriate for use by IRTF research group\
    \ chairs.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   This document relies on the definitions provided in Section\
    \ 1 of\n   [RFC3979].\n   The term \"formal disclosure\" refers to an IPR disclosure\
    \ statement\n   that has been officially submitted by using the IPR disclosure\
    \ tools\n   currently available at <http://www.ietf.org/ipr/file-disclosure> or\n\
    \   by sending a message to ietf-ipr@ietf.org.  The term \"informal\n   disclosure\"\
    \ refers to a statement that is provided in a less official\n   manner, such as\
    \ orally during a presentation, in writing within\n   presentation materials,\
    \ or posted via email to the relevant\n   discussion list before a presentation.\n\
    \   Since this document is purely informational, by intent it does not\n   use\
    \ the conformance language described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Background
  contents:
  - "2.  Background\n   The responsibilities of IETF contributors regarding IPR disclosure\n\
    \   are documented in [RFC3979] and [RFC4879].  These documents do not\n   assign\
    \ any further responsibilities to ADs, WG chairs, and WG\n   secretaries, other\
    \ than those imposed by their roles as contributors\n   or participants.  However,\
    \ late disclosure of IPR has a direct impact\n   on the effectiveness of working\
    \ groups, WG chairs, and ADs.\n   According to [RFC2418], WG chairs are responsible\
    \ for \"making forward\n   progress through a fair and open process\" and ADs\
    \ are responsible for\n   \"ensuring that working groups in their area produce\
    \ ... timely\n   output\"; in addition, because WG chairs can appoint one or more\
    \ WG\n   secretaries to help them with the day-to-day business of running the\n\
    \   working group (see [RFC2418]), some of the actions suggested in this\n   document\
    \ might fall to WG secretaries.\n   IPR disclosure at the earliest possible time\
    \ is an essential feature\n   of a \"fair and open process\", and late disclosure\
    \ can impede timely\n   output since it can cause the WG to revisit previous decisions,\n\
    \   needlessly revise technical specifications, and face the prospect of\n   appeals.\
    \  To better fulfill their responsibilities in the IETF\n   Standards Process,\
    \ ADs, WG chairs, and WG secretaries might wish to\n   adopt strategies to encourage\
    \ early disclosure consistent with the\n   responsibilities established in [RFC3979]\
    \ and [RFC4879], such as the\n   strategies described in this document.\n"
- title: 3.  Strategies for Working Group Documents
  contents:
  - "3.  Strategies for Working Group Documents\n   Building upon the framework provided\
    \ in [RFC3669], this section\n   identifies opportunities to promote IPR disclosure\
    \ within the\n   document lifecycle for IETF working group documents.  These\n\
    \   opportunities are typically encountered during initial public\n   discussion,\
    \ working group adoption, WGLC, and IETF Last Call.  WG\n   chairs might also\
    \ want to make WG participants aware of the\n   importance of IPR disclosure more\
    \ generally, as exemplified by the\n   sample message provided under Appendix\
    \ A.1.\n   The strategies described in this section are primarily implemented\
    \ by\n   WG chairs.  (The exceptions are strategies for IETF Last Call, which\n\
    \   would be implemented by ADs.)  In cases where the WG secretary\n   creates\
    \ meeting agendas or initiates consensus calls, the secretary\n   might also implement\
    \ these strategies.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Presenting an Internet-Draft at an IETF Meeting
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Presenting an Internet-Draft at an IETF Meeting\n   The first opportunity\
    \ to encourage early IPR disclosure might occur\n   even before a technical proposal\
    \ becomes a working group document.\n   When IETF participants wish to promote\
    \ public discussion of a\n   personal draft in hopes of future adoption by a working\
    \ group, one\n   common strategy is to request a slot on the agenda at an upcoming\n\
    \   face-to-face meeting.  Before the community commits resources to\n   reviewing\
    \ and considering the draft, it is very reasonable for the WG\n   chairs to confirm\
    \ (often via email) that all IPR disclosures have\n   been submitted.  The chairs\
    \ ought to request confirmation from each\n   of the authors and listed contributors,\
    \ especially if those\n   individuals are associated with multiple organizations.\n\
    \   If the necessary disclosures have not been submitted, the chairs have\n  \
    \ a choice: deny the agenda slot unless formal IPR disclosure\n   statements are\
    \ submitted, or insist on informal disclosure.  One\n   factor in this decision\
    \ could be the number of revisions that have\n   occurred: the chairs might wish\
    \ to permit presentation of a -00 draft\n   with informal disclosure, but not\
    \ after a draft has gone through\n   multiple revision cycles.  If informal disclosure\
    \ is allowed, the\n   chairs ought to make sure that the disclosure is documented\
    \ in the\n   minutes, and ought to encourage submission of formal disclosure\n\
    \   statements after the meeting.\n   In some cases, an IETF participant has not\
    \ yet submitted an Internet-\n   Draft but might still request a slot on the agenda\
    \ to discuss a\n   proposal for a new draft, or a new feature for an existing\
    \ working\n   group document.  Here again, it is very reasonable for the WG chairs\n\
    \   to confirm, before approving the agenda slot, that all IPR claims\n   have\
    \ been disclosed (likely in an informal manner as described above,\n   since the\
    \ participant has not yet made a Contribution as defined by\n   the Internet Standards\
    \ Process [RFC3979]).\n   A sample message of the kind that might be sent at this\
    \ stage is\n   provided under Appendix A.2.\n"

    \ it would be based on incomplete assumptions.\n   Even if procedures such as\
    \ those described above have been\n   implemented to promote IPR disclosure during\
    \ initial public\n   discussion and adoption, features might have evolved in a\
    \ way that\n   introduces new IPR concerns.  In addition, new participants with\n\
    \   knowledge of IPR claims might have become active in the working\n   group.\
    \  Therefore, the WG chairs might wish to reconfirm with each of\n   the authors\

    \ been filed, even if they all work for the same\n   organization.  The chairs\
    \ might also wish to include a reminder about\n   the importance of IPR disclosures\
    \ in any WGLC message communicated to\n   the working group.  (Note: If IPR disclosure\
    \ statements have been\n   filed, the chairs might wish to include a link in the\
    \ WGLC message to\n   ensure that the consensus call reflects this information.)\n\

    \  To help prevent early IPR disclosures from becoming stale\n   or incomplete,\

    \ kind that ADs, WG\n   chairs, and WG secretaries can send to meeting presenters,\
    \ document\n   authors, document editors, listed contributors, and working groups\n\
    \   during various stages of the Internet Standards Process.  The\n   messages\
    \ use a hypothetical working group called the \"FOO WG\",\n   hypothetical WG\
    \ chairs named \"Alice\" and \"Bob\", a hypothetical author\n   named \"Nigel\
    \ Throckmorton\", a hypothetical AD named \"Christopher\",\n   and hypothetical\
    \ documents about a hypothetical technology called\n   \"wiffle\"; any resemblance\
    \ to actual working groups, WG chairs, ADs,\n   or documents is strictly coincidental.\
    \  The last two messages might\n   be appropriate for sending to individuals who\

  - "A.1.  General WG Reminder\n   Subject: Reminder about IETF IPR Policy\n   Dear\
    \ FOO WG:\n   As FOO WG chairs, we would like to minimize or hopefully even\n\
    \   eliminate late disclosures relating to documents under consideration\n   within\
    \ the FOO WG.  Therefore, you might see us send \"reminder\"\n   messages in the\
    \ future to authors or to the FOO WG email list as a\n   whole, asking people\
    \ whether they know of Intellectual Property\n   Rights (IPR) relating to specific\
    \ documents.  In order to comply with\n   IETF processes and avoid unnecessary\
    \ delays, document authors and\n   contributors to our discussions in the FOO\
    \ WG are asked to pay\n   careful attention to these messages and to reply in\
    \ a timely fashion.\n   Please note that these messages are only reminders of\
    \ existing IETF\n   policy, and we are all bound by that policy even in the absence\
    \ of\n   such reminder messages.  Everyone who participates in the Internet\n\
    \   Standards Process (whether by posting to IETF mailing lists,\n   authoring\
    \ documents, attending IETF meetings, or in other ways) needs\n   to be aware\
    \ of the IETF rules with regard to IPR.  These rules are\n   described in BCP\
    \ 79 and can be referenced through\n   <http://www.ietf.org/ipr/policy.html>.\
    \  In addition, online tools for\n   filing IPR disclosures can be found at\n\
    \   <http://www.ietf.org/ipr/file-disclosure>.  Finally, existing\n   disclosures\
    \ can be searched online at\n   <https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/search/>.\n\
    \   Also note that these are personal requirements applying to all IETF\n   participants\

    \ in the FOO WG.\n   Thanks,\n   Alice and Bob\n   (as FOO WG co-chairs)\n"
