  - "1.  Introduction\n   Managing dispersed serial line and modem pools for large\
    \ numbers of\n   users can create the need for significant administrative support.\n\
    \   Since modem pools are by definition a link to the outside world, they\n  \
    \ require careful attention to security, authorization and accounting.\n   This\
    \ can be best achieved by managing a single \"database\" of users,\n   which allows\
    \ for authentication (verifying user name and password) as\n   well as configuration\
    \ information detailing the type of service to\n   deliver to the user (for example,\
    \ SLIP, PPP, telnet, rlogin).\n   The RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User\
    \ Service) document [2]\n   specifies the RADIUS protocol used for Authentication\
    \ and\n   Authorization.  This memo extends the use of the RADIUS protocol to\n\
    \   cover delivery of accounting information from the Network Access\n   Server\
    \ (NAS) to a RADIUS accounting server.\n   This document obsoletes RFC 2139 [1].\
    \  A summary of the changes\n   between this document and RFC 2139 is available\
    \ in the \"Change Log\"\n   appendix.\n   Key features of RADIUS Accounting are:\n\
    \      Client/Server Model\n          A Network Access Server (NAS) operates as\
    \ a client of the\n          RADIUS accounting server.  The client is responsible\
    \ for\n          passing user accounting information to a designated RADIUS\n\
    \          accounting server.\n          The RADIUS accounting server is responsible\
    \ for receiving the\n          accounting request and returning a response to\
    \ the client\n          indicating that it has successfully received the request.\n\
    \          The RADIUS accounting server can act as a proxy client to\n       \
    \   other kinds of accounting servers.\n      Network Security\n          Transactions\
    \ between the client and RADIUS accounting server\n          are authenticated\
    \ through the use of a shared secret, which is\n          never sent over the\
    \ network.\n      Extensible Protocol\n          All transactions are comprised\
    \ of variable length Attribute-\n          Length-Value 3-tuples.  New attribute\
    \ values can be added\n          without disturbing existing implementations of\
    \ the protocol.\n"

- title: 1.2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Terminology\n   This document uses the following terms:\n   service   The\
    \ NAS provides a service to the dial-in user, such as PPP\n             or Telnet.\n\
    \   session   Each service provided by the NAS to a dial-in user\n           \
    \  constitutes a session, with the beginning of the session\n             defined\
    \ as the point where service is first provided and\n             the end of the\
    \ session defined as the point where service\n             is ended.  A user may\
    \ have multiple sessions in parallel or\n             series if the NAS supports\
    \ that, with each session\n             generating a separate start and stop accounting\
    \ record with\n             its own Acct-Session-Id.\n   silently discard\n  \
    \           This means the implementation discards the packet without\n      \
    \       further processing.  The implementation SHOULD provide the\n         \
    \    capability of logging the error, including the contents of\n            \
    \ the silently discarded packet, and SHOULD record the event\n             in\
    \ a statistics counter.\n"
- title: 2.  Operation
  contents:
  - "2.  Operation\n   When a client is configured to use RADIUS Accounting, at the\
    \ start of\n   service delivery it will generate an Accounting Start packet\n\
    \   describing the type of service being delivered and the user it is\n   being\
    \ delivered to, and will send that to the RADIUS Accounting\n   server, which\
    \ will send back an acknowledgement that the packet has\n   been received.  At\
    \ the end of service delivery the client will\n   generate an Accounting Stop\
    \ packet describing the type of service\n   that was delivered and optionally\
    \ statistics such as elapsed time,\n   input and output octets, or input and output\
    \ packets.  It will send\n   that to the RADIUS Accounting server, which will\
    \ send back an\n   acknowledgement that the packet has been received.\n   The\
    \ Accounting-Request (whether for Start or Stop) is submitted to\n   the RADIUS\
    \ accounting server via the network. It is recommended that\n   the client continue\
    \ attempting to send the Accounting-Request packet\n   until it receives an acknowledgement,\
    \ using some form of backoff.  If\n   no response is returned within a length\
    \ of time, the request is re-\n   sent a number of times.  The client can also\
    \ forward requests to an\n   alternate server or servers in the event that the\
    \ primary server is\n   down or unreachable.  An alternate server can be used\
    \ either after a\n   number of tries to the primary server fail, or in a round-robin\n\
    \   fashion.  Retry and fallback algorithms are the topic of current\n   research\
    \ and are not specified in detail in this document.\n   The RADIUS accounting\
    \ server MAY make requests of other servers in\n   order to satisfy the request,\
    \ in which case it acts as a client.\n   If the RADIUS accounting server is unable\
    \ to successfully record the\n   accounting packet it MUST NOT send an Accounting-Response\n\
    \   acknowledgment to the client.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Proxy
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Proxy\n   See the \"RADIUS\" RFC [2] for information on Proxy RADIUS. \
    \ Proxy\n   Accounting RADIUS works the same way, as illustrated by the following\n\
    \   example.\n   1.    The NAS sends an accounting-request to the forwarding server.\n\
    \   2.    The forwarding server logs the accounting-request (if desired),\n  \
    \       adds its Proxy-State (if desired) after any other Proxy-State\n      \
    \   attributes, updates the Request Authenticator, and forwards the\n        \
    \ request to the remote server.\n   3.    The remote server logs the accounting-request\
    \ (if desired),\n         copies all Proxy-State attributes in order and unmodified\
    \ from\n         the request to the response packet, and sends the accounting-\n\
    \         response to the forwarding server.\n   4.    The forwarding server strips\
    \ the last Proxy-State (if it added\n         one in step 2), updates the Response\
    \ Authenticator and sends\n         the accounting-response to the NAS.\n   A\
    \ forwarding server MUST not modify existing Proxy-State or Class\n   attributes\
    \ present in the packet.\n   A forwarding server may either perform its forwarding\
    \ function in a\n   pass through manner, where it sends retransmissions on as\
    \ soon as it\n   gets them, or it may take responsibility for retransmissions,\
    \ for\n   example in cases where the network link between forwarding and remote\n\
    \   server has very different characteristics than the link between NAS\n   and\
    \ forwarding server.\n   Extreme care should be used when implementing a proxy\
    \ server that\n   takes responsibility for retransmissions so that its retransmission\n\
    \   policy is robust and scalable.\n"
- title: 3.  Packet Format
  contents:
  - "3.  Packet Format\n   Exactly one RADIUS Accounting packet is encapsulated in\
    \ the UDP Data\n   field [4], where the UDP Destination Port field indicates 1813\n\
    \   (decimal).\n   When a reply is generated, the source and destination ports\
    \ are\n   reversed.\n   This memo documents the RADIUS Accounting protocol.  The\
    \ early\n   deployment of RADIUS Accounting was done using UDP port number 1646,\n\
    \   which conflicts with the \"sa-msg-port\" service.  The officially\n   assigned\
    \ port number for RADIUS Accounting is 1813.\n   A summary of the RADIUS data\

    \ field is one octet, and identifies the type of RADIUS\n      packet.  When a\
    \ packet is received with an invalid Code field, it\n      is silently discarded.\n\
    \      RADIUS Accounting Codes (decimal) are assigned as follows:\n          \
    \ 4       Accounting-Request\n           5       Accounting-Response\n   Identifier\n\
    \      The Identifier field is one octet, and aids in matching requests\n    \
    \  and replies.  The RADIUS server can detect a duplicate request if\n      it\
    \ has the same client source IP address and source UDP port and\n      Identifier\
    \ within a short span of time.\n   Length\n      The Length field is two octets.\
    \  It indicates the length of the\n      packet including the Code, Identifier,\
    \ Length, Authenticator and\n      Attribute fields.  Octets outside the range\
    \ of the Length field\n      MUST be treated as padding and ignored on reception.\
    \  If the\n      packet is shorter than the Length field indicates, it MUST be\n\
    \      silently discarded.  The minimum length is 20 and maximum length\n    \
    \  is 4095.\n   Authenticator\n      The Authenticator field is sixteen (16) octets.\
    \  The most\n      significant octet is transmitted first.  This value is used\
    \ to\n      authenticate the messages between the client and RADIUS accounting\n\
    \      server.\n   Request Authenticator\n      In Accounting-Request Packets,\
    \ the Authenticator value is a 16\n      octet MD5 [5] checksum, called the Request\
    \ Authenticator.\n      The NAS and RADIUS accounting server share a secret. \
    \ The Request\n      Authenticator field in Accounting-Request packets contains\
    \ a one-\n      way MD5 hash calculated over a stream of octets consisting of\
    \ the\n      Code + Identifier + Length + 16 zero octets + request attributes\
    \ +\n      shared secret (where + indicates concatenation).  The 16 octet MD5\n\
    \      hash value is stored in the Authenticator field of the\n      Accounting-Request\
    \ packet.\n      Note that the Request Authenticator of an Accounting-Request\
    \ can\n      not be done the same way as the Request Authenticator of a RADIUS\n\
    \      Access-Request, because there is no User-Password attribute in an\n   \
    \   Accounting-Request.\n   Response Authenticator\n      The Authenticator field\
    \ in an Accounting-Response packet is called\n      the Response Authenticator,\
    \ and contains a one-way MD5 hash\n      calculated over a stream of octets consisting\
    \ of the Accounting-\n      Response Code, Identifier, Length, the Request Authenticator\
    \ field\n      from the Accounting-Request packet being replied to, and the\n\
    \      response attributes if any, followed by the shared secret.  The\n     \
    \ resulting 16 octet MD5 hash value is stored in the Authenticator\n      field\
    \ of the Accounting-Response packet.\n   Attributes\n      Attributes may have\
    \ multiple instances, in such a case the order\n      of attributes of the same\

    \ a RADIUS accounting server,\n      and convey information used to provide accounting\
    \ for a service\n      provided to a user.  The client transmits a RADIUS packet\
    \ with the\n      Code field set to 4 (Accounting-Request).\n      Upon receipt\
    \ of an Accounting-Request, the server MUST transmit an\n      Accounting-Response\
    \ reply if it successfully records the\n      accounting packet, and MUST NOT\
    \ transmit any reply if it fails to\n      record the accounting packet.\n   \

    \ NUL (hex\n      00).  In particular, types \"text\" and \"string\" in RADIUS\
    \ do not\n      terminate with a NUL (hex 00).  The Attribute has a length field\n\
    \      and does not use a terminator.  Text contains UTF-8 encoded 10646\n   \
