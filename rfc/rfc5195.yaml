  - "1.  Introduction\n   The purpose of this document is to define a BGP-based auto-discovery\n
    \  mechanism for Layer-1 VPNs (L1VPNs) [L1VPN-FRMK].  The auto-discovery\n   mechanism
    for L1VPNs allows the provider network devices to\n   dynamically discover the
    set of PEs having ports attached to CE\n   members of the same VPN.  That information
    is necessary for\n   completing the signaling phase of L1VPN connections.  One
    main\n   objective of a L1VPN auto-discovery mechanism is to support the\n   \"single-end
    provisioning\" model, where addition of a new port to a\n   given L1VPN would
    involve configuration changes only on the PE that\n   has this port and on the
    CE that is connected to the PE via this\n   port.\n   The auto-discovery mechanism
    proceeds by having a PE advertise to\n   other PEs the following information,
    at a minimum: its own IP address\n   and the list of <private address, provider
    address> tuples local to\n   that PE.  Once that information is received, the
    remote PEs will\n   identify the list of VPN members they have in common with
    the\n   advertising PE, and use the information carried within the discovery\n
    \  mechanism to perform address resolution during the signaling phase of\n   Layer-1
    VPN connections.\n   Figure 1 highlights the network reference for using a BGP-based\n
    \  auto-discovery mechanism for Layer-1 VPNs.  For the purpose of the\n   auto-discovery
    mechanism, BGP is running only on the provider\n   network.  The PEs maintain
    per-VPN information tables called Port\n   Information Tables (PITs) related to
    <private address, provider\n   address> information.  More information on the
    PITs is in Section 2.\n                   PE1                        PE2\n               +---------+

  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Procedures\n   In the context of L1VPNs, a CE is connected to a PE via one
    or more\n   ports, where each port may consist of one or more channels or sub-\n
    \  channels.  Each port on a CE that connects the CE to a PE has an\n   identifier
    that is unique within that L1VPN (but need not be unique\n   across several L1VPNs).
    \ We refer to this identifier as the customer\n   port identifier (CPI).  Each
    port on a PE also has an identifier that\n   is unique within the provider network.
    \ We refer to this identifier\n   as the provider port identifier (PPI).  Note
    that IP addresses used\n   for CPIs or PPIs could be either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.\n
    \  For each L1VPN that has at least one port configured on a PE, the PE\n   maintains
    a Port Information Table (PIT).  A PIT contains a list of\n   <CPI, PPI> tuples
    for all the ports within its L1VPN.  Note that a\n   PIT may also hold routing
    information (for example, when CPIs are\n   learnt using a routing protocol).\n
    \  A PIT on a given PE is populated with two types of information.\n   - Information
    related to the CEs' ports attached to the ports on the\n     PE.  This information
    could be locally configured at the PE or\n     could be received from the CEs.\n
    \  - Information received from other PEs through the auto-discovery\n     mechanism.\n
    \  We refer to the former as local information, and to the latter as\n   remote
    information.  Propagation of local information to other PEs is\n   accomplished
    by using BGP multiprotocol extensions [RFC4760].  To\n   restrict the flow of
    this information to only the PITs within a given\n   L1VPN, we use BGP route filtering
    based on the Route Target Extended\n   Community [BGP-COMM], as follows.\n   Each
    PIT on a PE is configured with one or more Route Target\n   Communities, called
    \"export Route Targets\", that are used for tagging\n   the local information
    when it is exported into the provider's BGP.\n   The granularity of such tagging
    could be as fine as a single <CPI,\n   PPI> pair.  In addition, each PIT on a
    PE is configured (at\n   provisioning time) with one or more Route Target Communities,
    called\n   \"import Route Targets\", that restrict the set of routes that could
    be\n   imported from provider's BGP into the PIT to only the routes that\n   have
    at least one of these Communities.\n   Each of the following occurs at provisioning
    time: if a service\n   provider adds a new L1VPN port to a particular PE, this
    port is\n   associated with a PIT on that PE, and this PIT is associated with\n
    \  that L1VPN.\n   Note that since the protocol used to populate a PIT with remote\n
    \  information is BGP, and since BGP works across multiple autonomous\n   systems
    (ASs), it follows that the mechanism described in this\n   document could support
    L1VPNs that span multiple autonomous systems.\n   Although multi-AS L1VPNs are
    currently out of scope for the Basic\n   Mode, the mechanisms defined in this
    document appear to be easily\n   applicable to a multi-AS scenario, should such
    a need arise in the\n   future.  At that time, additional work may be required
    to examine\n   various aspects including security.\n"

  - "3.  Carrying L1VPN Information in BGP\n   The <CPI, PPI> mapping is carried using
    the Multiprotocol Extensions\n   to BGP [RFC4760].  [RFC4760] defines the format
    of two BGP\n   attributes, MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI, that can be used
    to\n   announce and withdraw the announcement of reachability information.\n   We
    introduce a new subsequent address family identifier, called\n   Layer-1 VPN auto-discovery
    information (value 69), and also a new\n   Network Layer Reachability Information
    (NLRI) format for carrying the\n   CPI and PPI information.\n   One or more <PPI,
    CPI> tuples could be carried in the above mentioned\n   BGP attributes.\n   The
    format of the NLRI is described in Figure 2.\n                   +---------------------------------------+\n
    \                  |     Length (1 octet)                  |\n                   +---------------------------------------+\n
    \                  |     Auto-discovery info (variable)    |\n                   +---------------------------------------+\n
    \                        Figure 2: Encoding of the NLRI\n   Note that the encoding
    of the auto-discovery information is described\n   in [L1VPN-BM], and note also
    that if the value of the Length of the\n   Next Hop field (of the MP_REACH_NLRI
    attribute) is 4, then the Next\n   Hop contains an IPv4 address.  If this value
    is 16, then the Next Hop\n   contains an IPv6 address.\n"

  - "4.  Carrying L1VPN Traffic Engineering Information in BGP\n   In addition to
    reachability information, the auto-discovery mechanism\n   MAY carry Traffic Engineering
    information used for the purpose of\n   egress path selection.  For example, a
    PE may learn the switching\n   capability and the maximum LSP bandwidth of remote
    L1VPN interfaces\n   from the remote PEs.  This document uses the BGP Traffic
    Engineering\n   Attribute [BGP-TE-ATTRIBUTE] to carry such information.\n"

  - "5.  Scalability\n   Recall that the Service Provider network consists of (a)
    PEs, (b) BGP\n   Route Reflectors, (c) P nodes (which are neither PEs nor Route\n
    \  Reflectors), and, in the case of multi-provider VPNs, (d) Autonomous\n   System
    Border Routers (ASBRs).\n   A PE router, unless it is a Route Reflector, does
    not retain L1VPN-\n   related information unless it has at least one VPN with
    an import\n   Route Target identical to one of the VPN-related information Route\n
    \  Target attributes.  If a PE does not have a VPN with a matching\n   import
    Route Target, it MUST then discard received l1VPN information.\n   Inbound filtering
    MUST be used to cause such information to be\n   discarded.  If a new import Route
    Target is later added to one of the\n   PE's VPNs (a \"VPN Join\" operation),
    it MUST then acquire the VPN-\n   related information it previously has discarded.\n
    \  In this case, the refresh mechanism described in [BGP-RFSH] MUST be\n   used.
    \ The outbound route filtering mechanisms of [BGP-ORF] and\n   [BGP-CONS] can
    also be used to advantage to make the filtering more\n   dynamic.\n   Similarly,
    if a particular import Route Target is no longer present\n   in any of a PE's
    VPN (as a result of one or more \"VPN Prune\"\n   operations), the PE MAY discard
    all the L1VPN BGP routes that, as a\n   result, no longer have any of the PE's
    PIT's import Route Targets as\n   one of their Route Target attributes.\n   Note
    that \"VPN Join\" and \"VPN Prune\" operations are non-disruptive,\n   and do
    not require any BGP connections to be brought down, as long as\n   the refresh
    mechanism of [BGP-RFSH] is used.\n   As a result of these distribution rules,
    no one PE ever needs to\n   maintain all routes for all L1VPNs; this is an important
    scalability\n   consideration.\n   Route reflectors can be partitioned among VPNs
    so that each partition\n   carries routes for only a subset of the L1VPNs supported
    by the\n   Service Provider.  Thus, no single route reflector is required to\n
    \  maintain VPN-related information for all VPNs.\n   For inter-provider VPNs,
    if multi-hop External BGP (EBGP) is used,\n   then the ASBRs need not maintain
    and distribute VPN-related\n   information at all.  P routers do not maintain
    any VPN-related\n   information.\n   As a result, no single component within the
    Service Provider network\n   has to maintain all the VPN-related information for
    all the VPNs.  So\n   the total capacity of the network to support increasing
    numbers of\n   VPNs is not limited by the capacity of any individual component.\n
    \  An important consideration to remember is that one may have any\n   number
    of INDEPENDENT BGP systems carrying VPN-related information.\n   This is unlike
    the case of the Internet, where the Internet BGP\n   system MUST carry all the
    Internet routes.  Thus, one significant\n   (but perhaps subtle) distinction between
    the use of BGP for the\n   Internet routing and the use of BGP for distributing
    VPN-related\n   information, as described in this document, is that the former
    is not\n   amenable to partition, while the latter is.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This document describes a BGP-based auto-discovery
    mechanism that\n   enables a PE that attaches to a particular L1VPN to discover
    the set\n   of other PE routers that attach to the same VPN.  Each PE router that\n
    \  is attached to a given VPN uses BGP to advertise that fact.  Other PE\n   routers
    that attach to the same VPN receive these BGP advertisements.\n   This allows
    that set of PEs to discover each other.  Note that a PE\n   will not always receive
    these advertisements directly from the remote\n   PEs; the advertisements can
    be received from \"intermediate\" BGP\n   speakers.\n   It is of critical importance
    that a particular PE MUST NOT be\n   \"discovered\" to be attached to a particular
    VPN unless that PE really\n   is attached to that VPN, and indeed is properly
    authorized to be\n   attached to that VPN.  If any arbitrary node on the Internet
    could\n   start sending these BGP advertisements, and if those advertisements\n
    \  were able to reach the PE nodes, and if the PE nodes accepted those\n   advertisements,
    then anyone could add any site to any L1VPN.  Thus,\n   the auto-discovery procedures
    described here presuppose that a\n   particular PE trusts its BGP peers to be
    who they appear to be, and\n   further, that it can trust those peers to be properly
    securing their\n   local attachments.  (That is, a PE MUST trust that its peers
    are\n   attached to, and are authorized to be attached to, the L1VPNs to\n   which
    they claim to be attached.)\n   If a particular remote PE is a BGP peer of the
    local PE, then the BGP\n   authentication procedures of [RFC2385] SHOULD be used
    to ensure that\n   the remote PE is who it claims to be, i.e., that it is a PE
    that is\n   trusted.\n   If a particular remote PE is not a BGP peer of the local
    PE, then the\n   information it is advertising is being distributed to the local
    PE\n   through a chain of BGP speakers.  The local PE MUST trust that its\n   peers
    only accept information from peers that they trust in turn, and\n   this trust
    relation MUST be transitive.  BGP does not provide a way\n   to determine that
    any particular piece of received information\n   originated from a BGP speaker
    that was authorized to advertise that\n   particular piece of information.  Hence,
    the procedures of this\n   document MUST be used only in environments where adequate
    trust\n   relationships exist among the BGP speakers (such as the case of using\n
    \  the auto-discovery mechanism within a single provider network).\n"
