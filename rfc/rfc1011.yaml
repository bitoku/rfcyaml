  - "INTRODUCTION\n   This RFC identifies the documents specifying the official protocols\n\
    \   used in the Internet.  Comments indicate any revisions or changes\n   planned.\n\
    \   To first order, the official protocols are those specified in the\n   \"DDN\
    \ Protocol Handbook\" (DPH), dated December 1985 (this is a three\n   volume set\
    \ with a total thickness of about 5 inches).\n   Older collections that include\
    \ many of these  specifications are the\n   \"Internet Protocol Transition Workbook\"\
    \ (IPTW), dated March 1982; the\n   \"Internet Mail Protocols\", dated November\
    \ 1982; and the \"Internet\n   Telnet Protocols and Options\", dated June 1983.\
    \  There is also a\n   volume of protocol related information called the \"Internet\
    \ Protocol\n   Implementers Guide\" (IPIG) dated August 1982.  An even older\n\
    \   collection is the \"ARPANET Protocol Handbook\" (APH) dated\n   January 1978.\
    \  Nearly all the relevant material from these\n   collections has been reproduced\
    \ in the current DPH.\n   The following material is organized as a sketchy outline.\
    \  The\n   entries are protocols (e.g., Transmission Control Protocol).  In each\n\
    \   entry there are notes on status, specification, comments, other\n   references,\
    \ dependencies, and contact.\n      The STATUS is one of: required, recommended,\
    \ elective,\n      experimental, or none.\n      The SPECIFICATION identifies\
    \ the protocol defining documents.\n      The COMMENTS describe any differences\
    \ from the specification or\n      problems with the protocol.\n      The OTHER\
    \ REFERENCES identify documents that comment on or expand\n      on the protocol.\n"

    \  COMMENTS:\n         This is the universal protocol of the Internet.  This datagram\n\
    \         protocol provides the universal addressing of hosts in the\n       \
    \  Internet.\n         A few minor problems have been noted in this document.\n\
    \         The most serious is a bit of confusion in the route options.\n     \
    \    The route options have a pointer that indicates which octet of\n        \
    \ the route is the next to be used.  The confusion is between the\n         phrases\
    \ \"the pointer is relative to this option\" and \"the\n         smallest legal\
    \ value for the pointer is 4\".  If you are\n         confused, forget about the\
    \ relative part, the pointer begins\n         at 4.  The MIL-STD description of\
    \ source routing is wrong in\n         some of the details.\n         Another\
    \ important point is the alternate reassembly procedure\n         suggested in\
    \ RFC 815.\n         Some changes are in the works for the security option.\n\
    \         Note that ICMP is defined to be an integral part of IP.  You\n     \
    \    have not completed an implementation of IP if it does not\n         include\
    \ ICMP.\n         The subnet procedures defined in RFC 950 are now considered\
    \ an\n         essential part of the IP architecture and must be implemented\n\
    \         by all hosts and gateways.\n      OTHER REFERENCES:\n         RFC 815\

    \         Listening Servers:  Several comments have been received on\n       \
    \  difficulties with contacting listening servers.  There should\n         be\

    \ on alternative models of system and process\n         organization for servers.\n\
    \         Maximum Segment Size:  The maximum segment size option should\n    \
    \     be generalized and clarified.  It can be used to either\n         increase\
    \ or decrease the maximum segment size from the default.\n         The TCP Maximum\
    \ Segment Size is the IP Maximum Datagram Size\n         minus forty.  The default\
    \ IP Maximum Datagram Size is 576.  The\n         default TCP Maximum Segment\
    \ Size is 536.  For further\n         discussion, see RFC 879.\n         Idle\
    \ Connections:  There have been questions about\n         automatically closing\
    \ idle connections.  Idle connections are\n         ok, and should not be closed.\
    \  There are several cases where\n         idle connections arise, for example,\
    \ in Telnet when a user is\n         thinking for a long time following a message\
    \ from the server\n         computer before his next input.  There is no TCP \"\
    probe\"\n         mechanism, and none is needed.\n         Queued Receive Data\
    \ on Closing:  There are several points where\n         it is not clear from the\
    \ description what to do about data\n         received by the TCP but not yet\
    \ passed to the user,\n         particularly when the connection is being closed.\
    \  In general,\n         the data is to be kept to give to the user if he does\
    \ a RECV\n         call.\n         Out of Order Segments:  The description says\
    \ that segments that\n         arrive out of order, that is, are not exactly the\
    \ next segment\n         to be processed, may be kept on hand.  It should also\
    \ point out\n         that there is a very large performance penalty for not doing\n\
    \         so.\n         User Time Out:  This is the time out started on an open\
    \ or send\n         call.  If this user time out occurs the user should be\n \
    \        notified, but the connection should not be closed or the TCB\n      \
    \   deleted.  The user should explicitly ABORT the connection if he\n        \
    \ wants to give up.\n"

    \ datagrams and other IP\n         related protocols on 802 networks was developed.\n\
    \         Due to some evolution of the IEEE 802.2 standards and the need\n   \
    \      to provide for a standard way to do additional DOD-IP related\n       \
    \  protocols (such as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)) on IEEE\n         802\

    \ the current policy (see RFC-990 section on IEEE\n         802 Numbers of Interest,\
    \ and RFC-948).\n         The policy is for DDN and Internet community to use\
    \ IEEE 802.2\n         encapsulation on 802.3, 802.4, and 802.5 networks by using\
    \ the\n         SNAP with an organization code indicating that the following 16\n\

    \  STATUS:\n      SPECIFICATION:  RFC 1006\n      COMMENTS:\n         This memo\
    \ describes a proposed protocol standard for the\n         Internet community.\
    \  The CCITT and the ISO have defined various\n         session, presentation,\
    \ and application recommendations which\n         have been adopted by the international\
    \ community and numerous\n         vendors.  To the largest extent possible, it\
    \ is desirable to\n         offer these higher level services directly to the\
    \ Internet,\n         without disrupting existing facilities.  This permits users\
    \ to\n         develop expertise with ISO and CCITT applications which\n     \
    \    previously were not available in the Internet.  The intention\n         is\
    \ that hosts within the Internet that choose to implement ISO\n         TSAP services\
    \ on top of the TCP be expected to adopt and\n         implement this standard.\
    \  Suggestions for improvement are\n         encouraged.\n         Please discuss\
    \ any plans for implementation or use of this\n         protocol with the contact.\n\

    \   Mapping Between X.400 and RFC 822  -------------------------- (X.400)\n  \
    \    STATUS:\n      SPECIFICATION:  RFC 987\n      COMMENTS:\n         The X.400\
    \ series of protocols have been defined by CCITT to\n         provide an Interpersonal\
    \ Messaging Service (IPMS), making use\n         of a store and forward Message\
    \ Transfer Service.  It is\n         expected that this standard will be implemented\
    \ very widely.\n         This document describes a set of mappings which will\
    \ enable\n         interworking between systems operating the X.400 protocols\
    \ and\n         systems using RFC 822 mail protocol or protocols derived from\n\
    \         RFC 822.\n"
