  - "Abstract\n   The IS-IS routing protocol (ISO 10589) requires reliable protocols\
    \ at\n   the link layer for point-to-point links.  As a result, it does not\n\
    \   use a three-way handshake when establishing adjacencies on point-to-\n   point\
    \ media.  This paper defines a backward-compatible extension to\n   the protocol\
    \ that provides for a three-way handshake.  It is fully\n   interoperable with\
    \ systems that do not support the extension.\n   Additionally, the extension allows\
    \ the robust operation of more than\n   256 point-to-point links on a single router.\n\
    \   This extension has been implemented by multiple router vendors; this\n   paper\
    \ is provided as information to the Internet community in order\n   to allow interoperable\
    \ implementations to be built by other vendors.\n"

  - "2.  Introduction\n   The IS-IS protocol [1] assumes certain requirements stated\
    \ in ISO\n   10589 (section 6.7.2) for the operation of IS-IS over point-to-point\n\
    \   links and hence provides only a two-way handshake when establishing\n   adjacencies\
    \ on point-to-point links.  The protocol does not operate\n   correctly if these\
    \ subnetwork requirements for point-to-point links\n   are not met.  The basic\
    \ mechanism defined in the standard is that\n   each side declares the other side\
    \ to be reachable if a Hello packet\n   is heard from it.  Once this occurs, each\
    \ side then sends a Complete\n   Sequence Number PDU (CSNP) to trigger database\
    \ synchronization.\n   Three failure modes are known.  First, if the link goes\
    \ down and then\n   comes back up, or one of the systems restarts, and the CSNP\
    \ packet is\n   lost, and the network has a cut set of one through the link, the\
    \ link\n   state databases on either side of the link will not synchronize for\
    \ a\n   full LSP refresh period (up to eighteen hours).\n   A second, more serious\
    \ failure, is that if the link fails in only one\n   direction, the failure will\
    \ only be detected by one of the systems.\n   Normally only one of the two systems\
    \ will announce the adjacency in\n   its link state packets, and the SPF algorithm\
    \ will thus ignore the\n   link.  However, if there are two parallel links between\
    \ systems and\n   one of them fails in one direction, SPF will still calculate\
    \ paths\n   between the two systems, and the system that does not notice the\n\
    \   failure will attempt to pass traffic down the failed link (in the\n   direction\
    \ that does not work).\n   The third issue is that on some physical layers, the\n\
    \   interconnectivity between endpoints can change without causing a\n   link-layer-down\
    \ condition.  In this case, a system may receive\n   packets that are actually\
    \ destined for a different system (or a\n   different link on the same system).\
    \  The receiving system may end up\n   thinking that it has an adjacency with\
    \ the remote system when in fact\n   the remote system is adjacent with a third\
    \ system.\n   The solution proposed here ensures correct operation of the protocol\n\
    \   over unreliable point-to-point links.  As part of the solution to the\n  \
    \ three-way handshaking issue,  a method is defined to remove the\n   limitation\
    \ of 255 point-to-point interfaces imposed by IS-IS [1].\n   This method is more\
    \ robust than the ad hoc methods currently in use.\n"

- title: 3.1  Handshaking
  contents:
  - "3.1  Handshaking\n   The intent is to provide a three-way handshake for point-to-point\n\
    \   adjacency establishment in a backward compatible fashion.  This is\n   done\
    \ by providing an optional mechanism that allows each system to\n   report its\
    \ adjacency three-way state; this allows a system to only\n   declare an adjacency\
    \ to be up if it knows that the other system is\n   receiving its IS-IS Hello\
    \ (IIH) packets.\n   The adjacency three-way state can be one of the following\
    \ types:\n   Down\n      This is the initial point-to-point adjacency three-way\
    \ state.  The\n      system has not received any IIH packet containing the three-way\n\
    \      handshake option on this point-to-point circuit.\n   Initializing\n   \
    \   The system has received IIH packet containing the three-way\n      handshake\
    \ option from a neighbor but does not know whether the\n      neighbor is receiving\
    \ its IIH packet.\n   Up\n      The system knows that the neighbor is receiving\
    \ its IIH packets.\n   The adjacency three-way state that is reported by this\
    \ mechanism is\n   not equal or equivalent to the adjacency state that is described\
    \ in\n   ISO 10589 [1].  If this mechanism is supported then an adjacency may\n\
    \   have two states, its state as defined in ISO 10589 [1], and its\n   three-way\
    \ state.  For example according to ISO 10589 [1] receipt of\n   an ISH will cause\
    \ an adjacency to go to Initializing state; however\n   receipt of an ISH will\
    \ have no effect on the three-way state of an\n   adjacency, which remains firmly\
    \ Down until it receives an IIH from a\n   neighbor that contains the three-way\
    \ handshaking option.\n   In addition, the neighbor's system ID and (newly-defined)\
    \ extended\n   circuit ID are reported in order to detect the case where the same\n\
    \   stream is being received by multiple systems (only one of which can\n   talk\
    \ back).\n   The mechanism is quite similar to the one defined in the Netware\
    \ Link\n   Services Protocol (NLSP) [2], a variant of IS-IS used for routing IPX\n\
    \   traffic.  The difference between this mechanism and the one used in\n   NLSP\
    \ is the location where the information is carried (NLSP uses two\n   of the reserved\
    \ bits in the IIH header, whereas this solution adds a\n   separate option to\
    \ the IIH), and the presence of the neighbor's\n   system ID and circuit ID. \
    \ In theory, using the reserved header bits\n   should be backward compatible,\
    \ since systems are supposed to ignore\n   them.  However, it was felt that this\
    \ was risky, as the use of\n   untested mechanisms such as this have led to problems\
    \ in the past in\n   other protocols.  New option codes, on the other hand, have\
    \ been\n   demonstrated to work properly, as the deployment of Integrated IS-IS\n\
    \   for IP [3] has done exactly this.\n   The new mechanism only comes into play\
    \ when the remote system\n   includes the new option in its IIH packet; if the\
    \ option is not\n   present, it is assumed that the system does not support the\
    \ new\n   mechanism, and so the old procedures are used.\n"
- title: 3.2  More Than 256 Interfaces
  contents:
  - "3.2  More Than 256 Interfaces\n   The IS-IS specification has an implicit limit\
    \ of 256 interfaces, as\n   constrained by the eight bit Circuit ID field carried\
    \ in various\n   packets.  Moderately clever implementors have realized that the\
    \ only\n   true constraint is that of 256 LAN interfaces, and for that matter\n\
    \   only 256 LAN interfaces for which a system is the Designated IS.\n   This\
    \ is because the only place that the circuit ID is advertised in\n   LSPs is in\
    \ the pseudonode LSP ID.\n   Implementors have treated the point-to-point Circuit\
    \ ID number space\n   as being independent from that of the LAN interfaces, since\
    \ these\n   Circuit IDs appear only in IIH PDUs and are only used for detection\n\
    \   of a change in identity at the other end of a link.  More than 256\n   point-to-point\
    \ interfaces have been supported by sending the same\n   circuit ID on multiple\
    \ interfaces.  This reduces the robustness of\n   the ID change detection algorithm,\
    \ since it would then be possible to\n   switch links between interfaces on a\
    \ system without detecting the\n   change.\n   Since the Circuit ID is an integral\
    \ part of the new handshaking\n   mechanism, a backward compatible mechanism for\
    \ expanding the circuit\n   ID number space is included in this specification.\n"

  - "4.2 Elements of Procedure\n   The new handshake procedure is added to the IS-IS\
    \ point-to-point IIH\n   state machine after the PDU acceptance tests have been\
    \ performed.\n   Although the extended circuit ID is only used in the context\
    \ of the\n   three-way handshake, it is worth noting that it effectively protects\n\
    \   against the unlikely event where a link is moved to another interface\n  \
    \ on a system that has the same local circuit ID, as the received PDUs\n   will\
    \ be ignored (via the checks defined below) and the existing\n   adjacency will\
    \ fail.\n   Add a clause e) to the end of section \"Receiving ISH PDUs by an\n\
    \   intermediate system\" (section 8.2.2 of [1]):\n      Set the state to be reported\
    \ in the Adjacency Three-Way State\n      field of the Point-to-Point Three-Way\
    \ Adjacency option to Down.\n   Add a clause e) to the end of section \"Sending\
    \ point-to-point IIH\n   PDUs\" (section 8.2.3 of [1]):\n      The IS SHALL include\
    \ the Point-to-Point Three-Way Adjacency option\n      in the transmitted Point-to-Point\
    \ IIH PDU.  The current three-way\n      state of the adjacency with its neighbor\
    \ on the link (as defined\n      in new section 8.2.4.1.1 introduced later in\
    \ the document) SHALL\n      be reported in the Adjacency Three-Way State field.\
    \  If no\n      adjacency exists, the state SHALL be reported as Down.\n     \
    \ The Extended Local Circuit ID field SHALL contain a value assigned\n      by\
    \ this IS when the circuit is created.  This value SHALL be\n      unique among\
    \ all the circuits of this Intermediate System.  The\n      value is not necessarily\
    \ related to that carried in the Local\n      Circuit ID field of the IIH PDU.\n\
    \      If the system ID and Extended Local Circuit ID of the neighboring\n   \
    \   system are known (in adjacency three-way state Initializing or\n      Up),\

    \ not, the\n      link is assumed to be functional in both directions, and the\n\
    \      procedures described in section 8.2.4.2 are followed.\n      If the option\
    \ is present and contains invalid Adjacency Three-Way\n      State, the PDU SHALL\
    \ be discarded and no further action is taken.\n      If the option with a valid\
    \ Adjacency Three-Way State is present,\n      the Neighbor System ID and Neighbor\
    \ Extended Local Circuit ID\n      fields, if present, SHALL be examined.  If\
    \ they are present, and\n      the Neighbor System ID contained therein does not\
    \ match the local\n      system's ID, or the Neighbor Extended Local Circuit ID\
    \ does not\n      match the local system's extended circuit ID, the PDU SHALL\
    \ be\n      discarded and no further action is taken.\n      If the Neighbor System\
    \ ID and Neighbor Extended Local Circuit ID\n      fields match those of the local\
    \ system, or are not present, the\n      procedures described in section 8.2.4.2\

    \ b, the action \"Up\" from state tables\n         5, 6, 7 and 8 may create a\
    \ new adjacency but the three-way\n         state of the adjacency SHALL be Down.\n\
    \      b) If the action taken from section 8.2.4.2 a or b  is \"Up\" or\n    \
