- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   There are a wide range of networked applications for which\
    \ it is\n   appropriate to provide SNMP Monitoring.  This includes both TCP/IP\n\
    \   and OSI applications.  This document defines a MIB which contains the\n  \
    \ elements common to the monitoring of any network service application.\n   This\
    \ information includes a table of all monitorable network service\n   applications,\
    \ a count of the associations (connections) to each\n   application, and basic\
    \ information about the parameters and status of\n   each application-related\
    \ association.\n   This MIB may be used on its own for any application, and for\
    \ most\n   simple applications this will suffice.  This MIB is also designed to\n\
    \   serve as a building block which can be used in conjunction with\n   application-specific\
    \ monitoring and management.  Two examples of this\n   are MIBs defining additional\
    \ variables for monitoring a Message\n   Transfer Agent (MTA) service or a Directory\
    \ Service Agent (DSA)\n   service. It is expected that further MIBs of this nature\
    \ will be\n   specified.\n   This MIB does not attempt to provide facilities for\
    \ management of the\n   host or hosts the network service application runs on,\
    \ nor does it\n   provide facilities for monitoring applications that provide\
    \ something\n   other than a network service.  Host resource and general application\n\
    \   monitoring is handled by the Host Resources MIB.\n"
- title: 2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework\n   The SNMPv2 Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of four major\n   components.  They are:\n      o  RFC 1442\
    \ [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for\n         describing and\
    \ naming objects for the purpose of management.\n      o  STD 17, RFC 1213 [2]\
    \ defines MIB-II, the core set of managed\n         objects for the Internet suite\
    \ of protocols.\n      o  RFC 1445 [3] which defines the administrative and other\n\
    \         architectural aspects of the framework.\n      o  RFC 1448 [4] which\
    \ defines the protocol used for network\n         access to managed objects.\n\
    \   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of\n   experimentation\
    \ and evaluation.\n"
- title: 2.1  Object Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.1  Object Definitions\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information\
    \ store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB\
    \ are\n   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)\n \
    \  defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an\n   OBJECT\
    \ IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object\n   type together\
    \ with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a\n   specific instantiation\
    \ of the object.  For human convenience, we\n   often use a textual string, termed\
    \ the descriptor, to refer to the\n   object type.\n"
- title: 3.  Rationale for having a Network Services Monitoring MIB
  contents:
  - "3.  Rationale for having a Network Services Monitoring MIB\n   Much effort has\
    \ been expended in developing tools to manage lower\n   layer network facilities.\
    \  However, relatively little work has been\n   done on managing application layer\
    \ entities.  It is neither efficient\n   nor reasonable to manage all aspects\
    \ of application layer entities\n   using only lower layer information.  Moreover,\
    \ the difficulty of\n   managing application entities in this way increases dramatically\
    \ as\n   application entities become more complex.\n   This leads to a substantial\
    \ need to monitor applications which\n   provide network services, particularly\
    \ distributed components such as\n   MTAs and DSAs, by monitoring specific aspects\
    \ of the application\n   itself.  Reasons to monitor such components include but\
    \ are not\n   limited to measuring load, detecting broken connectivity, isolating\n\
    \   system failures, and locating congestion.\n   In order to manage network service\
    \ applications effectively two\n   requirements must be met:\n      (1)  It must\
    \ be possible to monitor a large number of components\n           (typical for\
    \ a large organization).\n      (2)  Application monitoring must be integrated\
    \ into general\n           network management.\n   This specification defines\
    \ simple read-only access; this is\n   sufficient to determine up/down status\
    \ and provide an indication of a\n   broad class of operational problems.\n"
- title: 3.1  General Relationship to Other MIBs
  contents:
  - "3.1  General Relationship to Other MIBs\n   This MIB is intended to only provide\
    \ facilities common to the\n   monitoring of any network service application.\
    \  It does not provide\n   all the facilities necessary to monitor any specific\
    \ application.\n   Each specific type of network service application is expected\
    \ to have\n   a MIB of its own that makes use of these common facilities.\n"
- title: 3.2  Restriction of Scope
  contents:
  - "3.2  Restriction of Scope\n   The framework provided here is very minimal; there\
    \ is a lot more that\n   could be done. For example:\n   (1)  General network\
    \ service application configuration monitoring and\n        control.\n   (2) \
    \ Detailed examination and modification of individual entries in\n        service-specific\
    \ request queues.\n   (3)  Probing to determine the status of a specific request\
    \ (e.g. the\n        location of a mail message with a specific message-id).\n\
    \   (4)  Requesting that certain actions be performed (e.g. forcing an\n     \
    \   immediate connection and transfer of pending messages to some\n        specific\
    \ system).\n   All these capabilities are both impressive and useful.  However,\n\
    \   these capabilities would require provisions for strict security\n   checking.\
    \  These capabilities would also mandate a much more complex\n   design, with\
    \ many characteristics likely to be fairly\n   implementation-specific.  As a\
    \ result such facilities are likely to\n   be both contentious and difficult to\
    \ implement.\n   This document religiously keeps things simple and focuses on\
    \ the\n   basic monitoring aspect of managing applications providing network\n\
    \   services.  The goal here is to provide a framework which is simple,\n   useful,\
    \ and widely implementable.\n"
- title: 3.3  Relationship to Directory Services
  contents:
  - "3.3  Relationship to Directory Services\n   Use of and management of directory\
    \ services already is tied up with\n   network service application management.\
    \  There are clearly many\n   things which could be dealt with by directory services\
    \ and protocols.\n   We take the line here that static configuration information\
    \ is both\n   provided by and dealt with by directory services and protocols.\
    \  The\n   emphasis here is on transient application status.\n   By placing static\
    \ information in the directory, the richness and\n   linkage of the directory\
    \ information framework does not need to be\n   repeated in the MIB.  Static information\
    \ is information which has a\n   mean time to change of the order of days or longer.\n\
    \   When information about network service applications is stored in the\n   directory\
    \ (regardless of whether or not the network service\n   application makes direct\
    \ use of the directory), it is recommended\n   that a linkage be established,\
    \ so that:\n   (1)  The managed object contains its own directory name.  This\
    \ allows\n        all directory information to be obtained by reference.  This\
    \ will\n        let a SNMP monitor capable of performing directory queries\n \
    \       present this information to the manager in an appropriate format.\n  \
    \      It is intended that this will be the normal case.\n   (2)  The directory\
    \ will reference the location of the SNMP agent, so\n        that an SNMP capable\
    \ directory query agent could probe dynamic\n        characteristics of the object.\n\
    \   (3)  This approach could be extended further, so that the SNMP\n        attributes\
    \ are modelled as directory attributes.  This would\n        dramatically simplify\
    \ the design of directory service agents that\n        use SNMP to obtain the\
    \ information they need.\n"
- title: 4.  Application Objects
  contents:
  - "4.  Application Objects\n   This MIB defines a set of general purpose attributes\
    \ which would be\n   appropriate for a range of applications that provide network\n\
    \   services.  Both OSI and non-OSI services can be accomodated.\n   Additional\
    \ tables defined in extensions to this MIB provide\n   attributes specific to\
    \ specific network services.\n   A table is defined which will have one row for\
    \ each network service\n   application running on the system.  The only static\
    \ information held\n   on the application is its name.  All other static information\
    \ should\n   be obtained from various directory services.  The applDirectoryName\n\
    \   is an external key, which allows an SNMP MIB entry to be cleanly\n   related\
    \ to the X.500 Directory.  In SNMP terms, the applications are\n   grouped in\
    \ a table called applTable, which is indexed by an integer\n   key applIndex.\n\
    \   The type of the application will be determined by one or both of:\n   (1)\
    \  Additional MIB variables specific to the applications.\n   (2)  An association\
    \ to the application of a specific protocol.\n"
