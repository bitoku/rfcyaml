  - "1.  Introduction\n   Many applications of tunneling protocols such as PPTP [5]\
    \ and L2TP\n   [4] involve dial-up network access.  Some, such as the provision\
    \ of\n   secure access to corporate intranets via the Internet, are\n   characterized\
    \ by voluntary tunneling: the tunnel is created at the\n   request of the user\
    \ for a specific purpose.  Other applications\n   involve compulsory tunneling:\
    \ the tunnel is created without any\n   action from the user and without allowing\
    \ the user any choice in the\n   matter, as a service of the Internet service\
    \ provider (ISP).\n   Typically, ISPs providing a service want to collect data\
    \ regarding\n   that service for billing, network planning, etc.  One way to collect\n\
    \   usage data in dial-up networks is by means of RADIUS  Accounting [1].\n  \
    \ The use of RADIUS Accounting allows dial-up usage data to be\n   collected at\
    \ a central location, rather than stored on each NAS.\n   In order to collect\
    \ usage data regarding tunneling, new RADIUS\n   attributes are needed; this document\
    \ defines these attributes.  In\n   addition, several new values for the Acct-Status-Type\
    \ attribute are\n   proposed.  Specific recommendations for, and examples of,\
    \ the\n   application of this attribute for the L2TP protocol can be found in\n\
    \   RFC 2809.\n"
- title: 2.  Implementation Notes
  contents:
  - "2.  Implementation Notes\n   Compulsory tunneling may be part of a package of\
    \ services provided by\n   one entity to another.  For example, a corporation\
    \ might contract\n   with an ISP to provide remote intranet access to its employees\
    \ via\n   compulsory tunneling.  In this case, the integration of RADIUS and\n\
    \   tunnel protocols allows the ISP and the corporation to synchronize\n   their\
    \ accounting activities so that each side receives a record of\n   the user's\
    \ resource consumption.  This provides the corporation with\n   the means to audit\
    \ ISP bills.\n   In auditing, the User-Name, Acct-Tunnel-Connection, Tunnel-Client-\n\
    \   Endpoint and Tunnel-Server-Endpoint attributes are typically used to\n   uniquely\
    \ identify the call, allowing the Accounting-Request sent by\n   the NAS to be\
    \ reconciled with the corresponding Accounting-Request\n   sent by the tunnel\
    \ server.\n   When implementing RADIUS accounting for L2TP/PPTP tunneling, the\n\
    \   Call-Serial-Number SHOULD be used in the Acct-Tunnel-Connection\n   attribute.\
    \  In L2TP, the Call-Serial-Number is a 32-bit field and in\n   PPTP it is a 16-bit\
    \ field.  In PPTP the combination of IP Address and\n   Call-Serial-Number SHOULD\
    \ be unique, but this is not required.  In\n   addition, no method for determining\
    \ the Call-Serial-Number is\n   specified, which leaves open the possibility of\
    \ wrapping after a\n   reboot.\n   Note that a 16-bit Call-Serial-Number is not\
    \ sufficient to\n   distinguish a given call from all other calls over an extended\
    \ time\n   period.  For example, if the Call-Serial-Number is assigned\n   monotonically,\
    \ the NAS in question has 96 ports which are continually\n   busy and the average\
    \ call is of 20 minutes duration, then a 16-bit\n   Call-Serial-Number will wrap\
    \ within 65536/(96 * 3 calls/hour * 24\n   hours/day) = 9.48 days.\n"
