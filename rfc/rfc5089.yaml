  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC4655] describes the motivations and architecture for\
    \ a Path\n   Computation Element (PCE)-based path computation model for\n   Multi-Protocol\
    \ Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)\n   Traffic Engineered Label\
    \ Switched Paths (TE LSPs).  The model allows\n   for the separation of the PCE\
    \ from a Path Computation Client (PCC)\n   (also referred to as a non co-located\
    \ PCE) and allows for cooperation\n   between PCEs (where one PCE acts as a PCC\
    \ to make requests of the\n   other PCE).  This relies on a communication protocol\
    \ between a PCC\n   and PCE, and also between PCEs.  The requirements for such\
    \ a\n   communication protocol can be found in [RFC4657], and the\n   communication\
    \ protocol is defined in [PCEP].\n   The PCE architecture requires that a PCC\
    \ be aware of the location of\n   one or more PCEs in its domain, and, potentially,\
    \ of PCEs in other\n   domains, e.g., in the case of inter-domain TE LSP computation.\n\
    \   A network may contain a large number of PCEs, each with potentially\n   distinct\
    \ capabilities.  In such a context, it is highly desirable to\n   have a mechanism\
    \ for automatic and dynamic PCE discovery that allows\n   PCCs to automatically\
    \ discover a set of PCEs, along with additional\n   information about each PCE\
    \ that may be used by a PCC to perform PCE\n   selection.  Additionally, it is\
    \ valuable for a PCC to dynamically\n   detect new PCEs, failed PCEs, or any modification\
    \ to the PCE\n   information.  Detailed requirements for such a PCE discovery\n\
    \   mechanism are provided in [RFC4674].\n   Note that the PCE selection algorithm\
    \ applied by a PCC is out of the\n   scope of this document.\n   When PCCs are\
    \ LSRs participating in the IGP (OSPF or IS-IS), and PCEs\n   are either LSRs\
    \ or servers also participating in the IGP, an\n   effective mechanism for PCE\
    \ discovery within an IGP routing domain\n   consists of utilizing IGP advertisements.\n\
    \   This document defines extensions to IS-IS [ISO] to allow a PCE in an\n   IS-IS\
    \ routing domain to advertise its location, along with some\n   information useful\
    \ to a PCC for PCE selection, so as to satisfy\n   dynamic PCE discovery requirements\
    \ set forth in [RFC4674].\n   Generic capability advertisement mechanisms for\
    \ IS-IS are defined in\n   [RFC4971].  These allow a router to advertise its capabilities\
    \ within\n   an IS-IS area or an entire IS-IS routing domain.  This document\n\
    \   leverages this generic capability advertisement mechanism to fully\n   satisfy\
    \ the dynamic PCE discovery requirements.\n   This document defines a new sub-TLV\
    \ (named the PCE Discovery (PCED))\n   to be carried within the IS-IS Router Capability\
    \ TLV ([RFC4971]).\n   The PCE information advertised is detailed in Section 3.\
    \  Protocol\n   extensions and procedures are defined in Sections 4 and 5.\n \
    \  The IS-IS extensions defined in this document allow for PCE discovery\n   within\
    \ an IS-IS routing domain.  Solutions for PCE discovery across\n   AS boundaries\
    \ are beyond the scope of this document, and are for\n   further study.\n   This\
    \ document defines a set of sub-TLVs that are nested within each\n   other.  When\
    \ the degree of nesting TLVs is 2 (a TLV is carried within\n   another TLV) the\
    \ TLV carried within a TLV is called a sub-TLV.\n   Strictly speaking, when the\
    \ degree of nesting is 3, a sub-sub-TLV is\n   carried within a sub-TLV that is\
    \ itself carried within a TLV.  For\n   the sake of terminology simplicity, a\
    \ TLV carried within another TLV\n   is called a sub-TLV regardless of the degree\
    \ of nesting.\n"

  - "4.5.  PCE-CAP-FLAGS Sub-TLV\n   The PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV is an optional sub-TLV\
    \ used to indicate PCE\n   capabilities.  It MAY be present within the PCED sub-TLV.\
    \  It MUST\n   NOT be present more than once.  If it appears more than once, only\n\
    \   the first occurrence is processed and any others MUST be ignored.\n   The\
    \ value field of the PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV is made up of an array\n   of units\
    \ of 32-bit flags numbered from the most significant bit as\n   bit zero, where\
    \ each bit represents one PCE capability.\n   The PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV has the\
    \ following format:\n      TYPE:   5\n      LENGTH: Multiple of 4\n      VALUE:\
    \  This contains an array of units of 32-bit flags numbered\n              from\
    \ the most significant as bit zero, where each bit\n              represents one\
    \ PCE capability.\n   The PCE capability registry is managed by IANA; it is common\
    \ with\n   OSPF and defined in [RFC5088].\n   Reserved bits SHOULD be set to zero\
    \ on transmission and MUST be\n   ignored on receipt.\n"
- title: 5.  Elements of Procedure
  contents:
  - "5.  Elements of Procedure\n   The PCED sub-TLV is advertised within an IS-IS\
    \ Router Capability TLV\n   defined in [RFC4971].  As such, elements of procedures\
    \ are inherited\n   from those defined in [RFC4971].\n   The flooding scope is\
    \ controlled by the S flag in the IS-IS Router\n   Capability TLV (see [RFC4971]).\
    \  When the scope of the PCED sub-TLV\n   is area local, it MUST be carried within\
    \ an IS-IS Router Capability\n   TLV having the S bit cleared.  When the scope\
    \ of the PCED sub-TLV is\n   the entire IS-IS routing domain, it MUST be carried\
    \ within an IS-IS\n   Router Capability TLV having the S bit set.  Note that when\
    \ only the\n   L bit of the PATH-SCOPE sub-TLV is set, the flooding scope MUST\
    \ be\n   area local.\n   Note that an L1L2 node may include a PCED TLV in a Router\
    \ Capability\n   TLV with the S bit cleared in both in its L1 and L2 LSPs.  This\n\
    \   allows the flooding scope to be restricted to the L1 area and the L2\n   sub-domain.\n\
    \   When the PCE function is deactivated, the IS-IS speaker advertising\n   this\
    \ PCE MUST originate a new IS-IS LSP that no longer includes the\n   corresponding\
    \ PCED TLV.\n   The PCE address (i.e., the address indicated within the PCE-ADDRESS\n\
    \   sub-TLV) SHOULD be reachable via some prefixes advertised by IS-IS.\n   The\
    \ PCED sub-TLV information regarding a specific PCE is only\n   considered current\
    \ and useable when the router advertising this\n   information is itself reachable\
    \ via IS-IS calculated paths at the\n   level of the LSP in which the PCED sub-TLV\
    \ appears.\n   A change in the state of a PCE (activate, deactivate, parameter\n\
    \   change) MUST result in a corresponding change in the PCED sub-TLV\n   information\
    \ advertised by an IS-IS router (inserted, removed,\n   updated) in its LSP. \
    \ The way PCEs determine the information they\n   advertise, and how that information\
    \ is made available to IS-IS, is\n   out of the scope of this document.  Some\
    \ information may be\n   configured (e.g., address, preferences, scope) and other\
    \ information\n   may be automatically determined by the PCE (e.g., areas of\n\
    \   visibility).\n   A change in information in the PCED sub-TLV MUST NOT trigger\
    \ any SPF\n   computation at a receiving router.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  Backward Compatibility\n   The PCED sub-TLV defined in this document does\
    \ not introduce any\n   interoperability issues.\n   An IS-IS router not supporting\

    \ discovery\n   relies on the security of IS-IS.\n   Mechanisms defined to ensure\
    \ authenticity and integrity of IS-IS LSPs\n   [RFC3567] and their TLVs, can be\
    \ used to secure the PCED sub-TLV as\n   well.\n   IS-IS provides no encryption\
    \ mechanism for protecting the privacy of\n   LSPs and, in particular, the privacy\
    \ of the PCE discovery\n   information.\n"

    \   parameters to be configured on the PCE:\n      -The PCE IPv4/IPv6 address(es)\
    \ (see Section 4.1).\n      -The PCE Scope, including the inter-domain functions\
    \ (inter-area,\n       inter-AS, inter-layer), the preferences, and whether the\

- title: 9.4.  Verify Correct Operations
  contents:
  - "9.4.  Verify Correct Operations\n   The correlation of information advertised\

    \ the\n   PCED MIB [PCED-MIB].  The number of dropped, corrupt, and rejected\n\
