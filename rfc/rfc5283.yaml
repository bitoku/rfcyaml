  - "1.  Introduction\n   Link state Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) such as OSPF
    [OSPFv2]\n   and IS-IS [IS-IS] allow the partition of an autonomous system into\n
    \  areas or levels so as to increase routing scalability within a\n   routing
    domain.\n   However, [LDP] recommends that the IP address of the FEC Element\n
    \  should *exactly* match an entry in the IP Routing Information Base\n   (RIB).
    \ According to [LDP], section 3.5.7.1 (\"Label Mapping Messages\n   Procedures\"):\n
    \     An LSR [Label Switching Router] receiving a Label Mapping message\n      from
    a downstream LSR for a Prefix SHOULD NOT use the label for\n      forwarding unless
    its routing table contains an entry that exactly\n      matches the FEC Element.\n
    \  Therefore, MPLS LSPs between Label Edge Routers (LERs) in different\n   areas/levels
    are not set up unless the specific (e.g., /32 for IPv4)\n   loopback addresses
    of all the LERs are redistributed across all\n   areas.\n   The problem statement
    is discussed in section 4.  Then, in section 5\n   we extend the Label Mapping
    Procedure defined in [LDP] so as to\n   support the setup of contiguous inter-area
    LSPs while maintaining IP\n   prefix aggregation on the ABRs.  This consists of
    allowing for\n   longest-match-based Label Mapping.\n"

  - "4.  Problem Statement\n   Provider-based MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)
    networks are\n   expanding with the success of Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks\n
    \  [L3-VPN] and the new deployments of Layer 2 VPNs ([VPLS-BGP],\n   [VPLS-LDP]).
    \ Service providers' MPLS backbones are significantly\n   growing both in terms
    of density with the addition of Provider Edge\n   (PE) routers to connect new
    customers and in terms of footprint as\n   traditional Layer 2 aggregation networks
    may be replaced by IP/MPLS\n   networks.  As a consequence many providers need
    to introduce IGP\n   areas.  Inter-area LSPs (that is, LSPs that traverse at least
    two IGP\n   areas) are required to ensure MPLS connectivity between PEs located\n
    \  in distinct IGP areas.\n   To set up the required MPLS LSPs between PEs in
    different IGP areas,\n   service providers currently have three solutions: 1)
    LDP with IGP\n   route leaking, 2) BGP [MPLS-BGP] over LDP with MPLS hierarchy,
    and 3)\n   inter-area RSVP-TE (Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering\n
    \  [RSVP-TE]).\n   IGP route leaking consists of redistributing all specific PE
    loopback\n   addresses across area boundaries.  As a result, LDP finds in the
    RIB\n   an exact match for its FEC and sets up the LSP.  As a consequence,\n   the
    potential benefits that a multi-area domain may yield are\n   significantly diminished
    since a lot of addresses have to be\n   redistributed by ABRs, and the number
    of IP entries in the IGP Link\n   State Database (LSDB), RIB, and Forwarding Information
    Base (FIB)\n   maintained by every LSR of the domain (whatever the area/level
    it\n   belongs to) cannot be minimized.\n   Service providers may also set up
    these inter-area LSPs by using MPLS\n   hierarchy with BGP [MPLS-BGP] as a label
    distribution protocol\n   between areas.  The BGP next hop would typically be
    the ABRs, and the\n   BGP-created LSPs would be nested within intra-area LSPs
    set up by LDP\n   between PEs and ABRs and between ABRs.\n   This solution is
    not adequate for service providers which don't want\n   to run BGP on their provider
    routers as it requires BGP on all ABRs.\n   In addition, MPLS hierarchy does not
    allow locally protecting the LSP\n   against ABR failures (IP/LDP Fast Reroute),
    and hence ensuring sub-\n   50ms recovery upon ABR failure.  The resulting convergence
    time may\n   not be acceptable for stringent Service Level Agreements (SLAs)\n
    \  required for voice or mission-critical applications.  Finally, this\n   solution
    requires a significant migration effort for service\n   providers that started
    with LDP and IGP route leaking to quickly set\n   up the first inter-area LSPs.\n
    \  Service providers may also set up these inter-area LSPs by using\n   inter-area
    RSVP-TE [RSVP-TE].  This is a relevant solution when RSVP-\n   TE is already used
    for setting up intra-area LSPs, and inter-area\n   traffic engineering features
    are required.  In return, this is not a\n   desired solution when LDP is already
    used for setting up intra-area\n   LSPs, and inter-area traffic engineering features
    are not required.\n   To avoid the above drawbacks, there is a need for an LDP-based\n
    \  solution that allows setting up contiguous inter-area LSPs while\n   avoiding
    leaking of specific PE loopback addresses across area\n   boundaries, thereby
    keeping all the benefits of IGP hierarchy.\n   In that context, this document
    defines a new LDP Label Mapping\n   Procedure so as to support the setup of contiguous
    inter-area LSPs\n   while maintaining IP prefix aggregation on the ABRs.  This
    procedure\n   is similar to the one defined in [LDP] but performs an IP longest\n
    \  match when searching the FEC element in the RIB.\n"
  title: 4.  Problem Statement
- contents:
  - "5.  Longest-Match Label Mapping Message Procedure\n   This document defines a
    new Label Mapping Procedure for [LDP].  It is\n   applicable to IPv4 and IPv6
    prefix FEC elements (address families 1\n   and 2 as per the \"Address Family
    Numbers\" registry on the IANA site).\n   It SHOULD be possible to activate/deactivate
    this procedure by\n   configuration, and it SHOULD be deactivated by default.
    \ It MAY be\n   possible to activate it on a per-prefix basis.\n   With this new
    Longest-Match Label Mapping Procedure, an LSR receiving\n   a Label Mapping message
    from a neighbor LSR for a Prefix Address FEC\n   Element FEC1 SHOULD use the label
    for MPLS forwarding if its routing\n   table contains an entry that matches the
    FEC Element FEC1 and the\n   advertising LSR is a next hop to reach FEC1.  If
    so, it SHOULD\n   advertise the received FEC Element FEC1 and a label to its LDP
    peers.\n   By \"matching FEC Element\", one should understand an IP longest match.\n
    \  That is, either the LDP FEC element exactly matches an entry in the\n   IP
    RIB or the FEC element is a subset of an IP RIB entry.  There is\n   no match
    for other cases (i.e., if the FEC element is a superset of a\n   RIB entry, it
    is not considered a match).\n   Note that LDP re-advertises to its peers the specific
    FEC element\n   FEC1, and not the aggregated prefix found in the IP RIB during
    the\n   longest-match search.\n   Note that with this Longest-Match Label Mapping
    Procedure, each LSP\n   established by LDP still strictly follows the shortest
    path(s)\n   defined by the IGP.\n   FECs selected by this Longest-Match Label
    Mapping Procedure are\n   distributed in an ordered way.  In case of LER failure,
    the removal\n   of reachability to the FEC occurs using LDP ordered label\n   distribution
    mode procedures.  As defined in [LDP] in section A.1.5,\n   the FEC will be removed
    in an ordered way through the propagation of\n   Label Withdraw messages.  The
    use of this (un)reachability\n   information by application layers using this
    MPLS LSP (e.g.,\n   [MP-BGP]) is outside the scope of this document.\n   As per
    [LDP], LDP already has some interactions with the RIB.  In\n   particular, it
    needs to be aware of the following events:\n      - prefix up when a new IP prefix
    appears in the RIB,\n      - prefix down when an existing IP prefix disappears,\n
    \     - next-hop change when an existing IP prefix has a new next hop\n        following
    a routing change.\n   With this Longest-Match Label Mapping Message Procedure,
    multiple\n   FECs may be concerned by a single RIB prefix change.  The LSR MUST\n
    \  check all the FECs that are a subset of this RIB prefix.  So, some\n   LDP
    reactions following a RIB event are changed:\n      - When a new prefix appears
    in the RIB, the LSR MUST check if this\n        prefix is a better match for some
    existing FECs.  For example,\n        the FEC elements 192.0.2.1/32 and 192.0.2.2/32
    used the IP RIB\n        entry 192.0.2.0/24, and a new more specific IP RIB entry\n
    \       192.0.2.0/26 appears.  This may result in changing the LSR used\n        as
    next hop and hence the Next Hop Label Forwarding Entry\n        (NHLFE) for this
    FEC.\n      - When a prefix disappears in the RIB, the LSR MUST check all FEC\n
    \       elements that are using this RIB prefix as best match.  For each\n        FEC,
    if another RIB prefix is found as best match, LDP MUST use\n        it.  This
    may result in changing the LSR used as next hop and\n        hence the NHLFE for
    this FEC.  Otherwise, the LSR MUST remove\n        the FEC binding and send a
    Label Withdraw message.\n      - When the next hop of a RIB prefix changes, the
    LSR MUST change\n        the NHLFE of all the FEC elements using this prefix.\n
    \  Future work may define new management objects to the MPLS LDP MIB\n   modules
    [LDP-MIB] to activate/deactivate this Longest-Match Label\n   Mapping Message
    Procedure, possibly on a per-prefix basis.\n"

    - "7.1.  Deployment Considerations\n   LSRs compliant with this document are backward
      compatible with LSRs\n   that comply with [LDP].\n   For the successful establishment
      of end-to-end MPLS LSPs whose FECs\n   are aggregated in the RIB, this specification
      must be implemented on\n   all LSRs in all areas where IP aggregation is used.
      \ If an LSR on the\n   path does not support this procedure, then the LSP initiated
      on the\n   egress LSR stops at this non-compliant LSR.  There are no other\n
      \  adverse effects.\n   This extension can be deployed incrementally:\n      -
      It can be deployed on a per-area or per-routing-domain basis and\n        does
      not necessarily require an AS-wide deployment.  For\n        example, if all
      specific IP prefixes are leaked in the IGP\n        backbone area and only stub
      areas use IP aggregation, LSRs in\n        the backbone area don't need to be

    - "7.2.  Routing Convergence Time Considerations\n   IP and MPLS traffic restoration
      time is based on two factors: the\n   Shortest Path First (SPF) calculation
      in the control plane and\n   Forwarding Information Base (FIB) / Label FIB (LFIB)
      update time in\n   the forwarding plane.  The SPF calculation scales O(N*Log(N))
      where N\n   is the number of Nodes.  The FIB/LFIB update scales O(P) where P
      is\n   the number of modified prefixes.  Currently, with most routers\n   implementations,
      the FIB/LFIB update is the dominant component\n   [IGP-CONV], and therefore
      the bottleneck that should be addressed in\n   priority.  The solution documented
      in this document reduces the link\n   state database size in the control plane
      and the number of FIB\n   entries in the forwarding plane.  As such, it solves
      the scaling of\n   pure IP routers sharing the IGP with MPLS routers.  However,
      it does\n   not decrease the number of LFIB entries so is not sufficient to
      solve\n   the scaling of MPLS routers.  For this, an additional mechanism is\n
      \  required (e.g., introducing some MPLS hierarchy in LDP).  This is out\n   of
      scope for this document.\n   Compared to [LDP], for all failures except LER
      failure (i.e., links,\n   provider routers, and ABRs), the failure notification
      and the\n   convergence is unchanged.  For LER failure, given that the IGP\n
      \  aggregates IP routes on ABRs and no longer advertises specific\n   prefixes,
      the control plane and more specifically the routing\n   convergence behavior
      of protocols (e.g., [MP-BGP]) or applications\n   (e.g., [L3-VPN]) may be changed
      in case of failure of the egress LER\n   node.  For protocols and applications
      which need to track egress LER\n   availability, several solutions can be used,
      for example:\n   - Rely on the LDP ordered label distribution control mode --
      as\n     defined in [LDP] -- to know the availability of the LSP toward the\n
      \    egress LER.  The egress to ingress propagation time of that\n     unreachability
      information is expected to be comparable to the IGP\n     (but this may be implementation
      dependent).\n   - Advertise LER reachability in the IGP for the purpose of the\n
