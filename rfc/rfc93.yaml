  - "                      Initial Connection Protocol\n        A review of the Initial\
    \ Connection Protocol (ICP) first\ndescribed in RFC #66 and restated in RFC #80\
    \ has revealed an area of\nambiguity, which in turn reflects an ambiguity in the\
    \ Host-Host\nProtocol Document No. 1.  This is the definition of the message sent\n\
    over the connection from \"Server socket #1\".  In both referenced\nis not clear,\
    \ however, whether this 32 bit number is meant to follow\nan eight-bit \"message\
    \ data type\" code or not, stemming from the fact\nthat the Host-Host Protocol\
    \ makes provision for such codes but does\nnot seem to absolutely demand them.\n\
    \        Only one implementation of an ICP has been documented in the\nNWG literature\
    \ - that at UCSB (RFC #74).  The implementers of this ICP\nhave apparently interpreted\
    \ the Host-Host Protocol as demanding a\nmessage data type code, and therefore\
    \ do transmit a code of zero.\n        Steve Crocker indicates (private communication)\
    \ that the Host-\nHost Protocol was intended to require a message data type code.\
    \  We\ntherefore recommend that RFC numbers 66 and 80 be amended to show that\n\
    the \"even 32 bit number\" is preceded by a message data type code of\nzero (zero\
    \ is the only code currently defined).\n       [ This RFC was put into machine\
    \ readable form for entry ]\n        [ into the online RFC archives by James Thompson\
    \ 4/97 ]\n"
