This memo describes the relationship between the Internet Protocol (IP) [1] Type of Service and the service parameters of specific networks.
The IP Type of Service has the following fields: Bits 0 2:  Precedence.
Normal Throughput, 1   High Throughput.
Normal Relibility, 1   High Relibility.
Bit  6 7:  Reserved for Future Use. 0
Network Control 110 Internetwork Control
The individual networks listed here have very different and specific service choices.
The service choices are in two parts: Traffic Acceptance Catagories, and Application Type.
The Traffic Acceptance Catagories can be mapped into and out of the IP TOS precedence reasonably directly.
The  Application types can be mapped into the remaining IP TOS fields as follows.
Q/R 010    B1 011    B2 100
The service choices are in quite limited.
There is one priority bit that can be mapped to the high order bit of the IP TOS precedence.
The other choices are to use the regular ("Type 0") messages vs. the uncontrolled ("Type 3") messages, or to use single packet vs. multipacket messages.
The mapping of ARPANET parameters into IP TOS parameters can be as follows.
There is no priority indication.
The two choices are to use the station routing vs. point to point routing, or to require acknowledgments vs. having no acknowledgments.
The mapping of PRNET parameters into IP TOS parameters can be as follows.
There is no priority indication.
The four choices are to use the block vs. stream type, to select one of four delay catagories, to select one of two holding time strategies, or to request one of three reliability levels.
The mapping of SATNET parameters into IP TOS parameters can thus quite complex there being 2 4 2 3 48 distinct possibilities.
