Operations & Management Area Standards Track and Experimental Documents Abstract
This document seeks to record all usage of IPv4 addresses in currently deployed IETF Operations & Management Area accepted standards.
In order to successfully transition from an all IPv4 Internet to an all IPv6 Internet, many interim steps will be taken.
One of these steps is the evolution of current protocols that have IPv4 dependencies.
It is hoped that these protocols (and their implementations) will be redesigned to be network address independent, but failing that will at least dually support IPv4 and IPv6.
To this end, all Standards (Full, Draft, and Proposed), as well as Experimental RFCs, will be surveyed and any dependencies will be documented.
This document is part of a set aiming to record all usage of IPv4 addresses in IETF standards.
In an effort to have the information in a manageable form, it has been broken into 7 documents conforming to the current IETF areas (Application, Internet, Operations & Management, Routing, Security, Sub IP and Transport).
For a full introduction, please see the introduction [1].
The document is organized as described below:
Sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 each describe the raw analysis of Full, Draft, and Proposed Standards, and Experimental RFCs.
Each RFC is discussed in its turn starting with RFC 1 and ending with (around) RFC 3100.
The comments for each RFC are "raw" in nature.
That is, each RFC is discussed in a vacuum and problems or issues discussed do not "look ahead" to see if the problems have already been fixed.
Section 7 is an analysis of the data presented in Sections 3, 4, 5, and 6.
It is here that all of the results are considered as a whole and the problems that have been resolved in later RFCs are correlated.
Full Internet Standards (most commonly simply referred to as "Standards") are fully mature protocol specification that are widely implemented and used throughout the Internet.
RFC 1155 Structure of Management Information Section 3.2.3.2.
IpAddress defines the following: This application wide type represents a 32 bit internet address.
It is represented as an OCTET STRING of length 4, in network byte order.
There are several instances of the use of this definition in the rest of the document.
RFC 1212 Concise MIB definitions
In section 4.1.6 IpAddress is defined as: (6)  IpAddress valued: 4 sub identifiers, in the familiar a.b.c.d notation.
RFC 1213 Management Information Base
far too many instances of IPv4 addresses is this document to enumerate here.
The particular object groups that are affected are the IP group, the ICMP group, the TCP group, the UDP group, and the EGP group.
RFC 2578 Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)
Section 7.1.5 defines the IpAddress data type: The IpAddress type represents a 32 bit internet address.
It is represented as an OCTET STRING of length 4, in network byte order.
Note that the IpAddress type is a tagged type for historical reasons.
Network addresses should be represented using an invocation of the TEXTUAL CONVENTION macro.
Note the deprecated status of this type;  see RFC 3291 for details on the replacement TEXTUAL CONVENTION definitions.
RFC 2579 Textual Conventions for SMIv2
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
RFC 2580 Conformance Statements for SMIv2
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
RFC 3416 Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Section 4.2.2.1., Example of Table Traversal, and Section 4.2.3.1.
, Another Example of Table Traversal, both use objects from MIB2 whose data contains IPv4 addresses.
Other than their use in these example sections, there are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
RFC 3417 Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Section 2 Definitions contains the following definition:
OCTET STRING (SIZE (6)) Section 8.1, Usage Example, also contains examples which uses IPv4 address, but it has no significance in the operation of the specification.
RFC 3418 Management Information Base for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
Draft Standards Draft Standards represent the penultimate standard level in the IETF.
A protocol can only achieve draft standard when there are multiple, independent, interoperable implementations.
Draft Standards are usually quite mature and widely used.
RFC 1493 Definitions of Managed Objects for Bridges
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
RFC 1657 Definitions of Managed Objects for the Fourth Version of the Border Gateway Protocol
The MIB defined in this RFC deals with objects in a BGP4 based routing system and therefore contain many objects that are limited by the IpAddress 32 bit value defined in MIB2.
Clearly the values of this MIB are limited to IPv4 addresses.
No update is needed, although a new MIB should be defined for BGP4  to allow management of IPv6 addresses and routes.
RFC 1658 Definitions of Managed Objects for Character Stream Devices using
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
RFC 1659 Definitions of Managed Objects for RS 232 like Hardware Devices using
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
RFC 1660 Definitions of Managed Objects for Parallel printer like Hardware Devices using
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
RFC 1694 Definitions of Managed Objects for SMDS Interfaces using SMIv2
This MIB module definition defines the following subtree:
Although the objects in this group are read only, at the   agent's discretion they may be made read write so that the   management station, when appropriately authorized, may   change the addressing information related to the   configuration of a logical IP subnetwork implemented on   top of SMDS.
This table is necessary to support RFC1209 (IP over SMDS)   and gives information on the Group Addresses and ARP
Addresses used in the Logical IP subnetwork.
One SMDS address may be associated with multiple IP   addresses.
One SNI may be associated with multiple LISs.
SEQUENCE OF IpOverSMDSEntry MAX ACCESS
"The table of addressing information relevant to this entity's IP addresses."
The addressing information for one of this entity's IP addresses.
"The value of this object identifies the interface for which this entry contains management information. "
The IP address to which this entry's addressing information pertains."
"The SMDS Individual address of the IP station."
"The SMDS Group Address that has been configured to identify the SMDS Subscriber Network Interfaces (SNIs) of all members of the Logical IP Subnetwork (LIS) connected to the network supporting SMDS."
"The SMDS address (individual or group) to which ARP Requests are to be sent."
RFC 1724 RIP Version 2 MIB Extension
As expected, this RFC is filled with IPv4 dependencies since it defines a MIB module for an IPv4 only routing protocol.
A new MIB for RIPng is required.
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
RFC 1850 OSPF Version 2 Management Information Base
This MIB defines managed objects for OSPFv2 which is a protocol used to exchange IPv4 routing information.
Since OSPFv2 is limited to IPv4 addresses, a new MIB is required to support a new version of OSPF that is IPv6 aware.
RFC 2115 Management Information Base for Frame Relay DTEs
This specification has several examples of how IPv4 addresses might be mapped to Frame Relay DLCIs.
Other than those examples there are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
There is some discussion in one object definition about an interface performing a self test, but the object itself is IP version independent.
RFC 3592 Definitions of Managed Objects for the Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH)
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
RFC 3593 Textual Conventions for MIB Modules Using Performance History Based on 15 Minute Intervals
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
Proposed Standards Proposed Standards are introductory level documents.
There are no requirements for even a single implementation.
In many cases, Proposed are never implemented or advanced in the IETF standards process.
They therefore are often just proposed ideas that are presented to the Internet community.
Sometimes flaws are exposed or they are one of many competing solutions to problems.
In these later cases, no discussion is presented as it would not serve the purpose of this discussion.

The following objects are defined in Section 4, Definitions: mioxPleLastFailedEnAddr
ACCESS  read only STATUS  mandatory DESCRIPTION
"The last Encapsulated address that failed to find a corresponding X.121 address and caused mioxPleEnAddrToX121LkupFlrs to be incremented.
The first octet of this object contains the encapsulation type, the remaining octets contain the address of that type that failed.
Thus for an IP address, the length will be five octets
, the first octet will contain 204 (hex CC), and the last four octets will contain the IP address.
For a snap encapsulation, the first byte would be 128 (hex 80) and the rest of the octet string would have the snap header."
"The Encapsulation address of the remote host mapped by this table entry.
A length of zero indicates the remote IP address is unknown or unspecified for use as a PLE default.
The first octet of this object contains the encapsulation type, the remaining octets contain an address of that type.
Thus for an IP address, the length will be five octets
, the first octet will contain 204 (hex CC), and the last four octets will contain the IP address.
For a snap encapsulation, the first byte would be 128 (hex 80) and the rest of the octet string would have the snap header.
"The value of the encapsulation type.
For IP encapsulation this will have a value of 204 (hex CC).
For SNAP encapsulated packets, this will have a value of 128 (hex 80).
For CLNP, ISO 8473, this will have a value of 129 (hex 81).
For ES ES, ISO 9542, this will have a value of 130 (hex 82).
A value of 197 (hex C5) identifies the Blacker X.25 encapsulation.
A value of 0, identifies the Null encapsulation.
This value can only be written when the mioxPeerStatus object with the same mioxPeerIndex has a value of underCreation.
Setting this object to a value of 256 deletes the entry.
When deleting an entry, all other entries in the mioxPeerEncTable with the same mioxPeerIndex and with an mioxPeerEncIndex higher then the deleted entry, will all have their mioxPeerEncIndex values decremented by one."

Without enumeration, let it be stated that a new MIB for IPv6 Mobility is required.
Management Information Base for the Internet Protocol using SMIv2
Approximately 1/3 of the objects defined in this document are IPv4  dependent.
New objects need to be defined to support IPv6. 5.28.
Management Information Base for the Transmission Control Protocol using
A number of object definitions in this MIB assumes IPv4 addresses, as is noted in the note reproduced below: IESG Note:
The IP, UDP, and TCP MIB modules currently support only IPv4.
These three modules use the IpAddress type defined as an OCTET STRING of length 4 to represent the IPv4 32 bit internet addresses.
(See RFC 1902, SMI for SNMPv2.)
They do not support the new 128 bit IPv6 internet addresses.

This object may not be modified if the associated trapDestStatus object is equal to active(1).
However, since they use a SYNTAX of OCTET STRING, they should work fine for IPv6 addresses.
A new legitimate value of trapDestProtocol
(i.e., SYNTAX addition of ipv6(3) should make this specification functional for IPv6. 5.32.
RFC 2024 Definitions of Managed Objects for Data Link Switching using SMIv2
The following textual conventions are defined:
TEXTUAL CONVENTION STATUS  current DESCRIPTION
"Denotes a transport service address.
For dlswTCPDomain, a TAddress is 4 octets long, containing the IP address in network byte order."
"Represents the IP address of a DLSw which uses TCP as a transport protocol."
Additionally there are many object definitions that use a SYNTAX of TAddress within the document.
Interestingly the SYNTAX for TAddress is an OCTET string of up to 256 characters.
It could easily accommodate a similar hybrid format for IPv6 addresses.
A new OID to enhance functionality for DlswTCPAddress could be added to support IPv6 addresses.
RFC 2051 Definitions of Managed Objects for APPC using
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
The MIB module's main conceptual table ipCidrRouteTable uses IPv4 addresses as index objects and is therefore incapable of representing an IPv6 forwarding information base.

Consult 'Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)' for further information on snmpUDPDomain.
A new TC should be defined to handle IPv6 addresses.
RFC 2584 Definitions of Managed Objects for APPN/HPR in IP Networks
Many of the object definitions described in this document assume the use of the IPv4 only TOS header bits.

This MIB defines the followings objects:
The NAS IP Address of the RADIUS authentication client referred to in this table entry."
RFC 2622 Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL)
The only objects in the version of RPSL that deal with IP addresses are defined as: <ipv4 address>
For example, 128.9.128.5 represents a valid IPv4 address.
In the rest of this document, we may refer to IPv4 addresses as IP addresses.
The following are valid address prefixes: 128.9.128.5/32, 128.9.0.0/16, 0.0.0.0/0; and the following address prefixes are invalid:  0/0, 128.9/16
since 0 or 128.9 are not strings containing four integers.
There seems to be an awareness of IPv6 because of the terminology
but it is not specifically defined.
Therefore additional objects for IPv6 addresses and prefixes need to be defined.
RFC 2662 Definitions of Managed Objects for the ADSL Lines
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
The Abstract of this document says: This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing tunnels of any type over IPv4 networks.
Extension MIBs may be designed for managing protocol specific objects.
Likewise, extension MIBs may be designed for managing security specific objects.
This MIB does not support tunnels over non IPv4 networks (including IPv6 networks).
Management of such tunnels may be supported by other MIBs.
A similar MIB for tunneling over IPv6 should be defined.
RFC 2669 DOCSIS Cable Device MIB Cable Device Management Information Base for DOCSIS compliant Cable Modems and Cable Modem Termination Systems
Please note that the DOCSIS 1.0 standard only requires Cable Modems to implement SNMPv1 and to process IPv4 customer traffic.
Design choices in this MIB reflect those requirements.
Future versions of the DOCSIS standard are expected to require support for SNMPv3 and IPv6 as well.
RFC 2670 Radio Frequency (RF) Interface Management Information Base for MCNS/DOCSIS compliant RF interfaces
This MIB defines the following objects
If the Cable Modem has no IP address assigned, or the IP address is unknown, this object returns a value of 0.0.0.0.

RFC 2925 Definitions of Managed Objects for Remote Ping, Traceroute, and Lookup Operations
This MIB mostly is IPv4 and IPv6 aware.
There are a few assumptions that are problems, though.
"Specifies the size of the data portion to be transmitted in a ping operation in octets.
A ping request is usually an ICMP message encoded into an IP packet.
An IP packet has a maximum size of 65535 octets.
Subtracting the size of the ICMP or UDP header (both 8 octets) and the size of the IP header (20 octets) yields a maximum size of 65507 octets.
"Specifies the size of the data portion of a traceroute request in octets.
A traceroute request is essentially transmitted by encoding a UDP datagram into a IP packet.
So subtracting the size of a UDP header (8 octets) and the size of a IP header (20 octets) yields a maximum of 65507 octets.
The DESCRIPTION clauses need to be updated to remove the IPv4 dependencies.

Experimental RFCs Experimental RFCs typically define protocols that do not have widescale implementation or usage on the Internet.
They are often propriety in nature or used in limited arenas.
They are documented to the Internet community in order to allow potential interoperability or some other potential useful scenario.
In a few cases, they are presented as alternatives to the mainstream solution to an acknowledged problem.

In the initial survey of RFCs, 36 positives were identified out of a total of 153, broken down as follows:
Additionally there are many instances of standards that should be updated but do not cause any operational impact if they are not updated.
The remaining instances are documented below.
STD 16, Structure of Management Information (RFCs 1155 and 1212)
RFC 1155 and RFC 1212 (along with the informational document RFC 1215) define
These documents have been superseded by RFCs 2578, 2579, and
Since SMIv1 is no longer being used as the basis for new IETF MIB modules, the limitations identified in this Internet Standard do not require any action.
STD 17 Simple Network Management Protocol (RFC 1213)
The limitations identified have been addressed, because RFC 1213 has been split into multiple modules which are all IPv6 capable.
This problem is currently being addressed by the Inter Domain Routing (IDR) WG [2].
SMDS MIB (RFC 1694) See Internet Area standards.
Once a specification for IPv6 over SMDS is created a new MIB must be defined.
There is no updated MIB module to cover the problems outlined.
A new MIB module should be defined.
This problem is currently being addressed by the OSPF WG [3].
RFC 1906 has been obsoleted by RFC 3417, Transport Mappings for SNMP, and the limitations of this specification have been addressed by that RFC, which defines TCs that can be used to specify transport domains in an IP version independent way.
RFC 3419 recommends that those TCs be used in place of SnmpUDPAddress when IPv6 support is required and for all new applications that are not SNMP specific.
MIB for Multiprotocol Interconnect over X.25 (RFC 1461)
This problem has not been addressed.
If a user requirement for IPv6 over X.25 develops (which is thought to be unlikely) then this MIB module will need to be updated in order to accommodate it.
PPP IPCP MIB (RFC 1473)
There is no updated MIB to cover the problems outlined.
A new MIB should be defined.
This problem has not been addressed.
If a user requirement for IPv6 over Appletalk develops (which is thought to be unlikely) then this MIB module will need to be updated (or a new MIB module will need to be created) in order to accommodate it.
The Definitions of Managed Objects for IP Mobility Support using SMIv2 (RFC 2006)
The problems are being resolved by the MIP6 WG [4].
SMIv2 IP MIB (RFC 2011)
This issue is being resolved by the IPv6 WG [5].
This issue is being resolved by the IPv6 WG [6].
This issue is being resolved by the IPv6 WG [7].
RMON II MIB (RFC 2021)
This issue has been brought to the attention of the RMONMIB WG.
Currently, there is a work in progress [8] to update RFC 2021, but it does not address the problems that have been identified; it is expected that there will be a resolution in a future version of that document.
DataLink Switching using SMIv2 MIB (RFC 2024)
The problems have not been addressed and an updated MIB should be defined.
IP Forwarding Table MIB (RFC 2096)
This issue is being worked on by the IPv6 WG [9].
Classical IP & ARP over ATM MIB (RFC 2320)
The current version of Classical IP and ARP over ATM (RFC 2225) does not support IPv6.
If and when that protocol specification is updated to add IPv6 support, then new MIB objects to represent IPv6 addresses will need to be added to this MIB module.
Multicast over UNI 3.0/3.1 ATM MIB (RFC 2417)
The current version of Multicast over UNI 3.0/3.1 ATM (RFC 2022) does not support IPv6.
If and when that protocol specification is updated to add IPv6 support, then new MIB objects to represent IPv6 addresses will need to be added to this MIB module.
The AToM MIB WG is currently collecting implementation reports for RFC 2515 and is considering whether to advance, revise, or retire this specification.
The problems identified have been brought to the attention of the WG.
The problems identified are not being addressed and a new MIB module may need to be defined.
The problems identified are not being addressed and a new MIB module may need to be defined.
One possible solution might be to use the RFC 3419 TCs.
Definitions of Managed Objects for APPN/HPR in IP Networks (RFC 2584)
The problems identified are not addressed and a new MIB may be defined.
The problems have not been addressed and a new MIB should be defined.
RADIUS Authentication Server MIB (RFC 2619)
The problems have not been addressed and a new MIB should be defined.
Additional objects must be defined for IPv6 addresses and prefixes.
[10] defines extensions to solve this issue, and it is being considered for publication.
IPv4 Tunnel MIB (RFC 2667)
The issue is being resolved.
This problem is currently being addressed by the IPCDN WG.
RF MIB For DOCSIS (RFC 2670)
This problem is currently being addressed by the IPCDN WG [11].
The problems have not been addressed and a new MIB may need to be defined.
MIB For Traceroute, Pings and Lookups
The problems have not been addressed and a new MIB may need to be defined.
IPv4 Multicast Routing MIB (RFC 2932)
The problems have not been addressed a new MIB must be defined.
This problem is currently being addressed by the MAGMA WG [12].
Protocol Independent Multicast MIB for IPv4 (RFC 2934)
The problems have not been addressed and a new MIB may need to be defined.
This memo examines the IPv6 readiness of specifications; this does not have security considerations in itself.
