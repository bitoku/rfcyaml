- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The age of quantum networking is upon us, and with it comes\n  \
    \ \"entanglement\": a procedure in which a state (i.e., a bit) can be\n   transferred\
    \ instantly, with no measurable delay between peers.  This\n   will lead to a\
    \ perceived round-trip time of zero seconds on some\n   Internet paths, a capability\
    \ which was not predicted and so not\n   included as a possibility in many protocol\
    \ specifications.  Worse\n   than the millennium bug, this unexpected value is\
    \ bound to cause\n   serious Internet failures unless the specifications are fixed\
    \ in\n   time.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC6921] discusses faster-than-light communication, where\
    \ packets\n   arrive before they are sent.  While it is amusing to entertain the\n\
    \   possibility of time travel, we have to accept the cold facts: time\n   travel\
    \ will never work (or it would already have been used).  Quantum\n   networking,\
    \ however, is an entirely different matter -- commercial\n   products are already\
    \ available, and quantum networks will without a\n   doubt become the prevalent\
    \ Internet link-layer technology across the\n   globe within the next five to\
    \ ten years.\n   With the help of entanglement, implemented in quantum repeaters,\n\
    \   quantum networks can transfer information faster than ever before: a\n   state\
    \ can be transmitted over a long distance instantly, with no\n   delay.  This\
    \ is so cool that it is also called (and, by some,\n   mistaken for) teleportation.\
    \  If a path between a sender and a\n   receiver is fully quantum-ized, the measured\
    \ one-way delay (OWD) will\n   be zero.  What's more, assuming that there are\
    \ blazing fast quantum\n   computers involved on both ends, the processing time\
    \ will be well\n   below anything measurable; hence, even the round-trip time\
    \ (RTT) will\n   be zero in these scenarios.\n   In today's Internet, only very\
    \ few protocols are prepared for such\n   \"0-RTT\" situations (e.g., TCP with\
    \ \"TCP Fast Open\" (TFO) [RFC7413],\n   TLS 1.3 [RFC8446], and QUIC [QUIC-TRANS]).\
    \  Many others will fail in\n   interesting ways; we coin the term \"Quantum Bug\"\
    \ for such failures.\n   In the following section, we will discuss some examples\
    \ of Quantum\n   Bugs.\n"
- title: 2.  Protocols and Protocol Mechanisms That Will Fail
  contents:
  - "2.  Protocols and Protocol Mechanisms That Will Fail\n   The number of protocols\
    \ and protocol mechanisms that will fail in the\n   face of a zero RTT is too\
    \ large to report here; we are truly heading\n   towards something close to an\
    \ Internet meltdown.  We can only provide\n   some guidance to those who hunt\
    \ for the Quantum Bug, by discussing\n   examples of specification mistakes that\
    \ will need to be fixed.\n"
- title: 2.1.  LEDBAT
  contents:
  - "2.1.  LEDBAT\n   The Low Extra Delay Background Transfer (LEDBAT) congestion\
    \ control\n   mechanism [RFC6817] is a very interesting failure case: designed\
    \ to\n   \"get out of the way\" of other traffic; it will end up sending as fast\n\
    \   as possible.  Specifically, when the algorithm described in\n   Section 2.4.2\
    \ of [RFC6817] obtains a delay sample, it updates a list\n   of base delays that\
    \ will all become 0 and current delays that will\n   also all become 0.  It calculates\
    \ a queuing delay as the difference\n   between the current delay and the base\
    \ delay (resulting in 0) and\n   keeps increasing the Congestion Window (cwnd)\
    \ until the queuing delay\n   reaches a predefined parameter value TARGET (100\
    \ milliseconds or\n   less).\n   A TARGET value of 100 milliseconds will never\
    \ be reached, because the\n   queuing delay does not grow when the sender increases\
    \ its cwnd; this\n   means that LEDBAT would endlessly increase its cwnd, limited\
    \ only by\n   the number of bits that are used to represent cwnd.  However, given\n\
    \   that TARGET=0 is also allowed, this parameter choice may seem to be a\n  \
    \ way out.  Always staying at the target means that the sender would\n   maintain\
    \ its initial cwnd, which should be set to 2.  This may seem\n   like a small\
    \ number, but remember that cwnd is the number of bytes\n   that can be transmitted\
    \ per RTT (which is 0).  Thus, irrespective of\n   the TARGET value, the sender\
    \ will send data as fast as it can.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Multipath TCP (MPTCP)
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Multipath TCP (MPTCP)\n   The coupled congestion control mechanism proposed\
    \ for MPTCP in\n   [RFC6356] requires calculating a value called \"alpha\".  Equation\
    \ 2 in\n   [RFC6356] contains a term where a value called \"cwnd_i\" is divided\
    \ by\n   the square of the RTT, and another term where this value is divided\n\
    \   by the RTT.  Enough said.\n"
- title: 2.3.  RTP Circuit Breakers
  contents:
  - "2.3.  RTP Circuit Breakers\n   The RTP Circuit Breakers [RFC8083] require calculation\
    \ of a well-\n   known equation which yields the throughput of a TCP connection:\n\
    \                             s\n   X = -------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \     Tr*sqrt(2*b*p/3)+(t_RTO * (3*sqrt(3*b*p/8) * p * (1+32*p*p)))\n   where\
    \ Tr is the RTT and t_RTO is the retransmission timeout of TCP\n   (we don't need\
    \ to care about the other variables).  As we will\n   discuss in Section 3, t_RTO\
    \ is lower-bounded with 1 second;\n   therefore, it saves us from a division by\
    \ zero.  However, there is\n   also a simplified version of this equation:\n \
    \            s\n   X = ----------------\n       Tr*sqrt(2*b*p/3)\n   Unfortunately,\
    \ [RFC8083] states: \"It is RECOMMENDED that this\n   simplified throughput equation\
    \ be used since the reduction in\n   accuracy is small, and it is much simpler\
    \ to calculate than the full\n   equation.\"  Due to this simplification, many\
    \ multimedia applications\n   will crash.\n"
- title: 3.  What can be done?
  contents:
  - "3.  What can be done?\n   Fear not: when everything else fails, TCP will still\
    \ work.  Its\n   retransmission timeout is lower-bounded by 1 second [RFC6298].\n\
    \   Moreover, while its cwnd may grow up to the maximum storable number,\n   data\
    \ transmission is limited by the Receiver Window (rwnd).  This\n   means that\
    \ flow control will save TCP from failing.\n   From this, we can learn two simple\
    \ rules: lower-bound any values\n   calculated from the RTT (and, obviously, do\
    \ not divide by the RTT),\n   and use flow control.  Specifications will need\
    \ to be updated by\n   fixing all RTT-based calculations and introducing flow\
    \ control\n   everywhere.  For example, UDP will have to be extended with a\n\
    \   receiver window, e.g., as a UDP option [UDP-OPT].\n"
- title: 4.  Conclusion
  contents:
  - "4.  Conclusion\n   We are in trouble, and there is only one way out: develop\
    \ a\n   comprehensive list of all RFCs containing \"0-RTT\" mistakes (taking\n\
    \   [RFC2626] as a guideline), and update all code.  This needs to happen\n  \
    \ fast, the clock is ticking.  Luckily, if we are too slow, we will\n   still\
    \ be able to use TCP to access the specifications.  With DNS over\n   TCP [RFC7766],\
    \ name resolution to find the server containing the\n   specifications should\
    \ also work.\n"

  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   This document has no IANA actions.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Flow control must be used on 0-RTT paths, or\
    \ else an attacker can\n   completely overwhelm a sender with data in a denial-of-service\
    \ (DoS)\n   attack within an instant.  Flow control will need to be added to\n\
    \   protocols that do not currently have it, such as UDP or ICMP.  IPv6\n   will\
    \ not save us.\n"
