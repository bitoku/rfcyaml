- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   This document describes a mechanism to allow senders of an\
    \ Internet\n   mail message to convey the message's contextual information.  Taking\n\
    \   account of this information, the receiving user agent (UA) can make\n   decisions\
    \ that improve message presentation for the user in the\n   context the sender\
    \ and receiver expects.\n   In this document, the \"message context\" conveys\
    \ information about the\n   way the user expects to interact with the message.\
    \  For example, a\n   message may be e-mail, voice mail, fax mail, etc.  A smart\
    \ UA may\n   have specialized behavior based on the context of the message.\n\
    \   This document specifies a RFC 2822 header called \"Message-Context\".\n  \
    \ The mechanism is in some ways similar to the use of the Content-\n   Disposition\
    \ MIME entity described in [6].  Content-Disposition gives\n   clues to the receiving\
    \ User Agent (UA) for how to display a given\n   body part.  Message-Context can\
    \ give clues to the receiving UA for\n   the presentation of the message.  This\
    \ allows the receiving UA to\n   present the message to the recipient, in a meaningful\
    \ and helpful\n   way.\n   Typical uses for this mechanism include:\n   o  Selecting\
    \ a special viewer for a given message.\n   o  Selecting an icon indicating the\
    \ kind of message in a displayed\n      list of messages.\n   o  Arranging messages\
    \ in an inbox display.\n   o  Filtering messages the UA presents when the user\
    \ has limited\n      access.\n"

- title: 3. Motivation
  contents:
  - "3. Motivation\n   Multimedia messaging systems receive messages that a UA may\
    \ present\n   in variety of ways.  For example, traditional e-mail uses simple\
    \ text\n   messages that the recipient displays and edits.  One UA may\n   automatically\
    \ print Fax images.  Another UA may play voice messages\n   through a telephone\
    \ handset.  Likewise, a receiving desktop computer\n   may process or present\
    \ documents transferred over e-mail using a\n   local application.  Emerging and\
    \ future developments may deliver\n   other forms of information that have their\
    \ own characteristics for\n   user presentation, such as video messages and pager\
    \ messages.\n   An often-requested characteristic for multimedia messaging systems\
    \ is\n   to collect received messages in a \"universal inbox\", and to offer\n\
    \   them to the user as a combined list.\n   In the context of \"unified messaging\"\
    , different message contexts may\n   have different implied semantics.  For example,\
    \ some users may\n   perceive voicemail to have an implicit assumption of urgency.\
    \  Thus\n   they may wish to gather them together and process them before other\n\
    \   messages.  This results in the end-user receiving agent needing to be\n  \
    \ able to identify voicemail and distinguish it from other messages.\n   The uses\
    \ of this kind of presentation characteristic for each message\n   are multi-fold:\n\
    \   o  Display an indication to the user (e.g., by a suitably evocative\n    \
    \  icon along with other summary fields),\n   o  Auto-forward a given message\
    \ type into another messaging\n      environment (e.g., a page to a mobile short\
    \ message service),\n   o  Prioritize and group messages in an inbox display list,\n\
    \   o  Suggest appropriate default handling for presentation,\n   o  Suggest appropriate\
    \ default handling for reply, forward, etc.\n   A problem faced by multimedia\
    \ messaging systems is that it is not\n   always easy to decide the context of\
    \ a received message.  For\n   example, consider the following scenarios.\n  \
    \ o  A message that contains audio and image data:  Is this a fax\n      message\
    \ that happens to have some voice commentary?  Is it a voice\n      message that\
    \ is accompanied by some supplementary diagrams?  Is it\n      a fully multimedia\
    \ message, in which all parts are expected to\n      carry equal significance?\n\
    \   o  A message containing text and audio data:  Is this e-mail with an\n   \
    \   MP3 music attachment?  Is it a voice message that happens to have\n      been\
    \ generated with an initial text header for the benefit of\n      non-voice-enabled\
    \ e-mail receivers?\n   The message context does relate to the message media content.\n\
    \   However, it is not the same thing.  As shown above, the media type\n   used\
    \ in a message is not sufficient to indicate the message context.\n   One cannot\
    \ determine a priori which media types to use in alternative\n   (gateway) messages.\
    \  Also, what if the user cares about\n   distinguishing traditional e-mail text\
    \ from SMS messages?  They are\n   both the same media type, text, but they have\
    \ different user\n   contexts.\n"
- title: 4. Functional Requirements
  contents:
  - "4. Functional Requirements\n   The goals stated above lead to the following functional\
    \ requirements.\n   For receivers:\n   o  Identify a message as belonging to a\
    \ message class.\n   o  Incorrect or invalid message classification must not result\
    \ in\n      failure to transfer or inability to present a message.\n   For senders:\n\
    \   o  Specify message classes by the originating user's choice of\n      authoring\
    \ tool or simple user interaction.\n   For both:\n   o  Specify a well-defined\
    \ set of message classes to make\n      interoperability between mail user agents\
    \ (UAs) possible.\n   o  Message classification information has to be interpretable\
    \ in\n      reasonable fashion by many different user agent systems.\n   o  The\
    \ mechanism should be extensible to allow for the introduction\n      of new kinds\
    \ of messages.\n   NOTE: We specifically do not specify user agent behavior when\
    \ the\n   user agent forwards a message.  Clearly, the user agent, being\n   message-context-aware,\
    \ should provide a meaningful message-context.\n   It is obvious what to do for\
    \ the easy cases.  Messages that the user\n   simply forwards will most likely\
    \ keep the context unchanged.\n   However, it is beyond the scope of this document\
    \ to specify the user\n   agent behavior for any other scenario.\n"
- title: 5. Determining the Message Context
  contents:
  - "5. Determining the Message Context\n   One method of indicating the interpretation\
    \ context of a message is\n   to examine the media types in the message.  However,\
    \ this requires\n   the UA to scan the entire message before it can make this\n\
    \   determination.  This approach is particularly burdensome for the\n   multi-media\
    \ mail situation, as voice and especially video mail\n   objects are quite large.\n\
    \   We considered indicating the message context by registering a\n   multipart/*\
    \ MIME subtype (Content-Type).  For example, the VPIM Work\n   Group has registered\
    \ multipart/voice-message to indicate that a\n   message is primarily voice mail\
    \ [7].  However, multipart/voice-\n   message is identical in syntax to multipart/mixed.\
    \  The only\n   difference is that VPIM mail transfer agents and user agents\n\
    \   recognize that they can perform special handling of the message based\n  \
    \ on it being a voice mail message.  Moreover, Content-Type refers to a\n   given\
    \ MIME body part, not to the message as a whole.\n   We wish to avoid scanning\
    \ the entire message.  In addition, we wish\n   to avoid having to create multiple\
    \ aliases for multipart/mixed every\n   time someone identifies a new primary\
    \ content type.  Multiple aliases\n   for multipart/mixed are not desirable as\
    \ they remove the possibility\n   for specifying a message as multipart/alternate,\
    \ multipart/parallel,\n   or multipart/encrypted, for example.\n   Since the message\
    \ context is an attribute of the entire message, it\n   is logical to define a\
    \ new top-level (RFC 2822 [3]) message\n   attribute.  To this end, this document\
    \ introduces the message\n   attribute \"Message-Context\".\n   Message-Context\
    \ only serves to identify the message context.  It does\n   not provide any indication\
    \ of content that the UA must be capable of\n   delivering.  It does not imply\
    \ any message disposition or delivery\n   notification.  There is a related effort\
    \ to define Critical Content\n   of Internet Mail [8] that one might use to perform\
    \ these tasks.\n   Message-Context is only an indicator.  We do not intend for\
    \ it to\n   convey information that is critical for presentation of the message.\n\
    \   One can conceive of goofy situations, such as a message marked\n   \"voice-message\"\
    \ but without an audio body part.  In this case, the\n   fact that the contents\
    \ of a message don't match its context does not\n   mean the receiving system\
    \ should generate an error report or fail to\n   deliver or process the message.\n"
- title: 6. Message-Context Reference Field
  contents:
  - "6. Message-Context Reference Field\n   The Message-Context reference field is\
    \ a top-level header inserted by\n   the sending UA to indicate the context of\
    \ the message.\n   A receiving user agent MUST NOT depend on the indicated message-\n\
    \   context value in a way that prevents proper presentation of the\n   message.\
    \  If the value is incorrect or does not match the message\n   content, the receiving\
    \ user agent MUST still be capable of displaying\n   the message content at least\
    \ as meaningfully as it would if no\n   Message-Context value were present.\n\
    \   One can envision situations where a well-formed message ends up not\n   including\
    \ a media type one would expect from the message-context.\n   For example, consider\
    \ a voice messaging system that records a voice\n   message and also performs\
    \ speech-to-text processing on the message.\n   The message then passes through\
    \ a content gateway, such as a\n   firewall, that removes non-critical body parts\
    \ over a certain length.\n   The receiving user agent will receive a message in\
    \ the voice-message\n   context that has only a text part and no audio.  Even\
    \ though the\n   message does not have audio, it is still in the voice message\n\
    \   context.\n   Said differently, the receiving UA can use the message-context\
    \ to\n   determine whether, when, and possibly where to display a message.\n \
    \  However, the message-context should not affect the actual rendering\n   or\
    \ presentation.  For example, if the message is in the voice-message\n   context,\
    \ then don't try to send it to a fax terminal.  Conversely,\n   consider the case\
    \ of a message in the voice-message context that gets\n   delivered to a multimedia\
    \ voice terminal with a printer.  However,\n   this message only has fax content.\
    \  In this situation, the \"voice-\n   message\" context should not stop the terminal\
    \ from properly rendering\n   the message.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.1. Message-Context Syntax\n   The syntax of the Message-Context field, described\
    \ using the ABNF [4]\n   is as follows.  Note that the Message-Context header\

    \ nor fixed.  For example,\n   e-mails being typically text-based do not mean\
    \ that they cannot\n   convey a voice-message.  This very mutability serves to\
    \ underline the\n   desirability of providing some explicit message context hint.\n"
- title: 9.1. Internet e-mail
  contents:
  - "9.1. Internet e-mail\n   Internet e-mail carries textual information.  Sometimes\
    \ it conveys\n   computer application data of arbitrary size.\n   Typically, one\
    \ uses e-mail for non-urgent messages, which the\n   recipient will retrieve and\
    \ process at a time convenient to her.\n   The normal device for receiving and\
    \ processing e-mail messages is\n   some kind of personal computer.  Modern personal\
    \ computers usually\n   come with a reasonably large display and an alphanumeric\
    \ keyboard.\n   Audio, video, and printing capabilities are not necessarily\n\
    \   available.\n   One can use E-mail for communication between two parties (one-to-\n\
    \   one), a small number of known parties (one-to-few) or, via an e-mail\n   distribution\
    \ list, between larger numbers of unknown parties (one-\n   to-many).\n   One\
    \ of the endearing characteristics of e-mail is the way that it\n   allows the\
    \ recipient to forward all or part of the message to another\n   party, with or\
    \ without additional comments.  It is quite common for\n   an e-mail to contain\
    \ snippets of content from several previous\n   messages.  Similar features apply\
    \ when replying to e-mail.\n"
- title: 9.2. Pager service
  contents:
  - "9.2. Pager service\n   One uses a pager message to convey notifications and alerts.\
    \  For the\n   most part, these notifications are textual information of limited\n\
    \   size.  The typical limit is 160 characters.  People use pages for\n   relatively\
    \ urgent messages, which the sender wishes the receiver to\n   see and possibly\
    \ respond to within a short time period.  Pager\n   messages are often used as\
    \ a way of alerting users to something\n   needing their attention.  For example,\
    \ a system can use a page to\n   notify a subscriber there is a voicemail message\
    \ requiring her\n   attention.\n   Example devices for sending and receiving a\
    \ pager message are a\n   mobile telephone with a small character display or a\
    \ text pager.\n   Personal computers and personal digital assistants (PDAs) can\
    \ also\n   participate in pager messaging.\n   Currently, the most common use\
    \ of pager messages are between just two\n   parties (one-to-one).\n   One delivery\
    \ method for pager messages is the short text messaging\n   service (SMS).  SMS\
    \ is a facility that has evolved for use with\n   mobile telephones, and has an\
    \ associated per-message transmission\n   charge.  Note that the focus here is\
    \ on the notification aspect of\n   SMS.  From the beginning, SMS was envisioned\
    \ to be more than a simple\n   pager service.  Operators can use SMS to provision\
    \ the phone, for\n   example.  From the subscriber point of view, SMS has evolved\n\
    \   considerably from its origins as a pure pager replacement service.\n   For\
    \ example, with mobile originate service, people can have two-way\n   text chat\
    \ sessions using SMS and a mobile phone.  In addition, there\n   are SMS-enabled\
    \ handsets that can display pictures.  However, for the\n   purposes of this document,\
    \ there is still a need to capture the\n   essence of a \"highly urgent, short-text,\
    \ notification or alert\"\n   service.\n   Users often send pager messages in\
    \ isolation, rather than as part of\n   a longer exchange.  One use for them is\
    \ as a prompt or invitation to\n   communicate by some more convenient and content-rich\
    \ method, such as\n   a telephone call.\n"
- title: 9.3. Facsimile
  contents:
  - "9.3. Facsimile\n   People use facsimile to convey image information of moderate\
    \ size,\n   typically a small number of pages.  Sometimes people use facsimile\n\
    \   for larger documents.\n   Facsimile is a facility that usually uses circuit-switched\
    \ telephone\n   circuits, with connection-time charges.  Message transfer takes\
    \ place\n   in real-time.  Thus, people often use facsimile for urgent\n   communication.\n\
    \   The normal device for sending and receiving a facsimile is a self-\n   contained\
    \ scanning and printing device connected to a telephone line\n   or a desktop\
    \ computer.\n   Most facsimiles are between just two parties (one-to-one).  However,\n\
    \   a significant portion of facsimile service is broadcast between\n   multiple\
    \ parties (one-to-many).\n   Most facsimile exchanges are in isolation, rather\
    \ than as part of a\n   longer exchange.  Facsimile data is typically not suitable\
    \ for\n   further processing by computer.\n"
- title: 9.4. Voice mail
  contents:
  - "9.4. Voice mail\n   People use voice mail to convey audio information, almost\
    \ exclusively\n   human speech.\n   Voice mail is a facility that usually uses\
    \ circuit-switched telephone\n   circuits, with modest connection-time charges,\
    \ often used for\n   moderately urgent messages.  A common use for them is as\
    \ a prompt or\n   invitation to communicate by some more convenient method, such\
    \ as a\n   telephone call.  In most, but not all cases, the sender of a voice\n\
    \   message does not want to send a message at all.  Rather, they wished\n   to\
    \ engage in a real-time conversation.\n   The normal device for sending and receiving\
    \ a voice mail is a\n   telephone handset.\n   Voice messages are usually sent\
    \ between just two parties (one-to-\n   one).\n   Voice mail data is not generally\
    \ suitable for further processing by\n   computer.\n"
- title: 9.5. Multimedia message
  contents:
  - "9.5. Multimedia message\n   We define a multimedia message as a message containing\
    \ more than one\n   basic media type (text, image, audio, video, model, application).\n\
    \   The following are some characteristics of a multimedia message.\n   In some\
    \ cases, a multimedia message is just e-mail with an attachment\n   that a multimedia\
    \ display application presents.  For example, I can\n   send you an MP3 of something\
    \ I recorded in my garage today.\n   In other cases, a multimedia message represents\
    \ a convergence between\n   two or more of the scenarios described above.  For\
    \ example, a voice\n   message with an accompanying diagram or a talking head\
    \ video message\n   is a multimedia message.\n   The characteristics will vary\
    \ somewhat with the intent of the sender.\n   This in turn may affect the user\
    \ agent or application used to render\n   the message.\n"
