- title: Status of this Memo
  contents:
  - "Status of this Memo\n   This memo describes an experimental method for the encapsulation\
    \ of\n   IP datagrams in avian carriers.  This specification is primarily\n  \
    \ useful in Metropolitan Area Networks.  This is an experimental, not\n   recommended\
    \ standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: Overview and Rational
  contents:
  - "Overview and Rational\n   Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput,\
    \ and low\n   altitude service.  The connection topology is limited to a single\n\
    \   point-to-point path for each carrier, used with standard carriers,\n   but\
    \ many carriers can be used without significant interference with\n   each other,\
    \ outside of early spring.  This is because of the 3D ether\n   space available\
    \ to the carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used by\n   IEEE802.3.  The carriers\
    \ have an intrinsic collision avoidance\n   system, which increases availability.\
    \  Unlike some network\n   technologies, such as packet radio, communication is\
    \ not limited to\n   line-of-sight distance.  Connection oriented service is available\
    \ in\n   some cities, usually based upon a central hub topology.\n"
- title: Frame Format
  contents:
  - "Frame Format\n   The IP datagram is printed, on a small scroll of paper, in\n\
    \   hexadecimal, with each octet separated by whitestuff and blackstuff.\n   The\
    \ scroll of paper is wrapped around one leg of the avian carrier.\n   A band of\
    \ duct tape is used to secure the datagram's edges.  The\n   bandwidth is limited\
    \ to the leg length.  The MTU is variable, and\n   paradoxically, generally increases\
    \ with increased carrier age.  A\n   typical MTU is 256 milligrams.  Some datagram\
    \ padding may be needed.\n   Upon receipt, the duct tape is removed and the paper\
    \ copy of the\n   datagram is optically scanned into a electronically transmittable\n\
    \   form.\n"
- title: Discussion
  contents:
  - "Discussion\n   Multiple types of service can be provided with a prioritized pecking\n\
    \   order.  An additional property is built-in worm detection and\n   eradication.\
    \  Because IP only guarantees best effort delivery, loss\n   of a carrier can\
    \ be tolerated.  With time, the carriers are self-\n   regenerating.  While broadcasting\
    \ is not specified, storms can cause\n   data loss.  There is persistent delivery\
    \ retry, until the carrier\n   drops.  Audit trails are automatically generated,\
    \ and can often be\n   found on logs and cable trays.\n"
- title: Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "Security Considerations\n   Security is not generally a problem in normal operation,\
    \ but special\n   measures must be taken (such as data encryption) when avian\
    \ carriers\n   are used in a tactical environment.\n"
