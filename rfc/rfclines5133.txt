Abstract The Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)
Q.921 User Adaptation Layer (IUA) Protocol, described in RFC 4233, defines the message type of Terminal Endpoint Identifier (TEI) Query Request messages as 5.
However, this number is already being used by the Digital Private Network Signaling System (DPNSS)/Digital Access Signaling System 2 (DASS 2)
Extensions (DUA) to the IUA Protocol described in RFC 4129.
This document updates RFC 4233
such that the message type of TEI Query Request messages is 8.
The Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) Q.921 User Adaptation Layer (IUA) protocol, described in [RFC3057], does not define a Terminal Endpoint Identifier (TEI) Query Request message.
The Digital Private Network Signaling System (DPNSS)/Digital Access Signaling System 2 (DASS 2)
Extensions (DUA) to the IUA Protocol, described in [RFC4129], introduces
Data Link Connection (DLC) Status messages of type 5, 6, and 7.
Then, [RFC4233] was published, which updates [RFC3057].
[RFC4233] also introduces the TEI Query Request message and uses the message type of 5 for it.
This makes it impossible to differentiate the DLC Status request from a TEI Query Request.

New Message Type of the TEI Query Message
This document updates [RFC4233] by introducing the following change: Terminal Endpoint Identifier (TEI)
Query messages MUST be encoded with a message type of 8 instead of 5 as described in [RFC4233].
In the "Message Types" section of the "Signaling User Adaptation Layer Assignments" registry, IANA has reserved the message type 8 of Management Messages for Terminal Endpoint Identifier (TEI) Query Request messages.
This document does not require any security considerations in addition to the ones given in [RFC4233].
