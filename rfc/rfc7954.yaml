- title: 2.  Definition of Terms
  contents:
  - "2.  Definition of Terms\n   The present document does not introduce any new terms\
    \ with respect to\n   the set of LISP Specifications ([RFC6830], [RFC6831], [RFC6832],\n\
    \   [RFC6833], [RFC6834], [RFC6835], [RFC6836], [RFC6837]), but it\n   assumes\
    \ that the reader is familiar with the LISP terminology.\n   [LISP-INTRO] provides\
    \ an introduction to the LISP technology,\n   including its terminology.\n"
- title: 3.  Rationale and Intent
  contents:
  - "3.  Rationale and Intent\n   Discussion within the LISP working group led to\
    \ the identification of\n   several scenarios in which the existence of a LISP-specific\
    \ address\n   block brings technical benefits.  The most relevant scenarios are\n\
    \   described below:\n   Early LISP destination detection:  With the current specifications,\n\
    \         there is no direct way to detect whether or not a certain\n        \
    \ destination is in a LISP domain without performing a LISP\n         mapping\
    \ lookup.  For instance, if an Ingress Tunnel Router\n         (ITR) is sending\
    \ packets to all types of destinations (i.e.,\n         non-LISP destinations,\
    \ LISP destinations not in the IPv6 EID\n         block, and LISP destinations\
    \ in the IPv6 EID block), the only\n         way to understand whether or not\
    \ to encapsulate the traffic is\n         to perform a cache lookup and, in case\
    \ of a LISP cache miss,\n         send a Map-Request to the mapping system.  In\
    \ the meanwhile\n         (while waiting for the Map-Reply), packets may be dropped\
    \ to\n         avoid excessive buffering.\n   Avoid penalizing non-LISP traffic:\
    \  In certain circumstances, it\n         might be desirable to configure a router\
    \ using LISP features to\n         natively forward all packets that do not have\
    \ a destination\n         address in the block and, hence, no lookup whatsoever\
    \ is\n         performed and packets destined to non-LISP sites are not\n    \
    \     penalized in any manner.\n   Traffic Engineering:  In some deployment scenarios,\
    \ it might be\n         desirable to apply different traffic-engineering policies\
    \ for\n         LISP and non-LISP traffic.  A LISP-specific EID block would\n\
    \         allow improved traffic-engineering capabilities with respect to\n  \
    \       LISP vs. non-LISP traffic.  In particular, LISP traffic might\n      \
    \   be identified without having to use Deep Packet Inspection\n         (DPI)\
    \ techniques in order to parse the encapsulated packet.\n         Instead, performing\
    \ a simple inspection of the outer header is\n         sufficient.\n   Transition\
    \ Mechanism:  The existence of a LISP-specific EID block may\n         prove useful\
    \ in transition scenarios.  A non-LISP domain would\n         ask for an allocation\
    \ in the LISP EID block and use it to\n         deploy LISP in its network.  Such\
    \ allocation would not be\n         announced in the BGP routing infrastructure\
    \ (cf. Section 4).\n         This approach will allow non-LISP domains to avoid\
    \ fragmenting\n         their already allocated non-LISP addressing space, which\
    \ may\n         lead to BGP routing table inflation since it may (rightfully)\n\
    \         be announced in the BGP routing infrastructure.\n   Limit the impact\
    \ on the BGP routing infrastructure:  As described in\n         the previous scenario,\
    \ LISP adopters will avoid fragmenting\n         their addressing space, since\
    \ fragmentation would negatively\n         impact the BGP routing infrastructure.\
    \  Adopters will use\n         addressing space from the EID block, which might\
    \ be announced\n         in large aggregates and in a tightly controlled manner\
    \ only by\n         Proxy Tunnel Routers (PxTRs).\n   It is worth mentioning that\
    \ new use cases may arise in the future,\n   due to new and unforeseen scenarios.\n\
    \   Furthermore, the use of a dedicated address block allows for tighter\n   control\
    \ over the traffic in the initial experimental phase\n   (especially filtering),\
    \ while facilitating its large-scale\n   deployment.\n   [RFC3692] considers assigning\
    \ experimental and testing numbers\n   useful; having a reserved IPv6 prefix enables\
    \ this practice.  The\n   present document follows the guidelines provided in\
    \ [RFC3692], with\n   one exception.  [RFC3692] suggests the use of values similar\
    \ to those\n   called \"Private Use\" in [RFC5226], which by definition are not\n\
    \   unique.  One purpose of the present request to IANA is to guarantee\n   uniqueness\
    \ to the EID block.  The lack thereof would result in a lack\n   of real utility\
    \ of a reserved IPv6 prefix.\n"
- title: 4.  Expected Use
  contents:
  - "4.  Expected Use\n   Sites planning to deploy LISP may request a prefix in the\
    \ IPv6 EID\n   block.  Such prefixes will be used for routing and endpoint\n \
    \  identification inside the site requesting it.  Mappings related to\n   such\
    \ a prefix, or part of it, will be made available through the\n   mapping system\
    \ in use and registered to one or more Map-Server(s).\n   The EID block must be\
    \ used for LISP experimentation and must not be\n   advertised in the form of\
    \ more specific route advertisements in the\n   non-LISP inter-domain routing\
    \ environment.  Interworking between the\n   EID block sub-prefixes and the non-LISP\
    \ Internet is done according to\n   the techniques described in [RFC6832] and\
    \ [RFC7215].\n   As the LISP adoption progresses, the EID block may potentially\
    \ have a\n   reduced impact on the BGP routing infrastructure, compared to the\n\
    \   case of having the same number of adopters using global unicast space\n  \
    \ allocated by Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) ([MobiArch2007]).\n   From\
    \ a short-term perspective, the EID block offers potentially large\n   aggregation\
    \ capabilities since it is announced by Proxy Tunnel\n   Routers (PxTRs), possibly\
    \ concentrating several contiguous prefixes.\n   This trend should continue with\
    \ even lower impact from a long-term\n   perspective, because more aggressive\
    \ aggregation can be used,\n   potentially leading to using fewer PxTRs announcing\
    \ the whole EID\n   block ([FIABook2010]).\n   The EID block will be used only\
    \ at the configuration level, so it is\n   recommended not to hard-code the IPv6\
    \ EID block in the router\n   hardware in any way.  This prevents locking out\
    \ sites that may want\n   to switch to LISP while keeping their own IPv6 prefix,\
    \ which is not\n   in the IPv6 EID block.  Furthermore, in the case of a future\n\
    \   permanent allocation, the allocated prefix may differ from the\n   experimental\
    \ temporary prefix allocated during the experimentation\n   phase.\n   With the\
    \ exception of the Proxy Ingress Tunnel Router (PITR) case\n   (described in Section\
    \ 8), prefixes out of the EID block must not be\n   announced in the BGP routing\
    \ infrastructure.\n"
- title: 5.  Block Dimension
  contents:
  - "5.  Block Dimension\n   The working group reached consensus on an initial allocation\
    \ of a /32\n   prefix.  The reason of such consensus is manifold:\n   o  The working\
    \ group agreed that the /32 prefix is sufficiently large\n      to cover initial\
    \ allocation and requests for prefixes in the EID\n      space in the next few\
    \ years for very large-scale experimentation\n      and deployment.\n   o  As\
    \ a comparison, it is worth mentioning that the current LISP Beta\n      Network\
    \ ([BETA]) is using a /32 prefix, with more than 250 sites\n      using a /48\
    \ sub-prefix.  Hence, a /32 prefix appears sufficiently\n      large to allow\
    \ the current deployment to scale up and be open for\n      interoperation with\
    \ independent deployments using the EIDs in the\n      new /32 prefix.\n   o \
    \ A /32 prefix is sufficiently large to allow deployment of\n      independent\
    \ (commercial) LISP-enabled networks by third parties,\n      but may as well\
    \ boost LISP experimentation and deployment.\n   o  The use of a /32 prefix is\
    \ in line with previous similar prefix\n      allocation for tunneling protocols\
    \ ([RFC3056]).\n"
- title: 6.  3+3 Allocation Plan
  contents:
  - "6.  3+3 Allocation Plan\n   Per this document, IANA has initially assigned a\
    \ /32 prefix out of\n   the IPv6 addressing space for use as EID in LISP.\n  \
    \ IANA allocated the requested address space in September 2016 for a\n   duration\
    \ of 3 (three) years (through September 2019), with an option\n   to extend this\
    \ period by 3 (three) more years (until September 2022).\n   By the end of the\
    \ first period, the IETF will provide a decision on\n   whether to transform the\
    \ prefix into a permanent assignment or to put\n   it back in the free pool (see\
    \ Section 7 for more information).\n   In the first case, i.e., if the IETF decides\
    \ to transform the block\n   into a permanent allocation, the EID block allocation\
    \ period will be\n   extended for three years (until September 2022) to give the\
    \ IETF time\n   to define the final size of the EID block and create a transition\n\
    \   plan.  The transition of the EID block into a permanent allocation\n   might\
    \ pose policy issues (as recognized in [RFC2860], Section 4.3);\n   therefore,\
    \ discussion with the IANA, the RIR communities, and the\n   IETF community will\
    \ be necessary to determine the appropriate policy\n   for permanent EID-block\
    \ allocation and management.  Note as well that\n   the final permanent allocation\
    \ may differ from the initial\n   experimental assignment; hence, it is recommended\
    \ not to hard-code\n   the experimental EID block on LISP-capable devices in any\
    \ way.\n   In the latter case, i.e., if the IETF decides to terminate the\n  \
    \ experimental-use EID block, all temporary prefix allocations in this\n   address\
    \ range must expire and be released by September 2019, so that\n   the entire\
    \ /32 is returned to the free pool.\n   The allocation and management of the EID\
    \ block for the initial 3-year\n   period (and the optional 3 more years) is detailed\
    \ in [RFC7955].\n"
- title: 7.  Allocation Lifetime
  contents:
  - "7.  Allocation Lifetime\n   If no explicit action is carried out by the end of\
    \ the experiment (by\n   September 2019), it is automatically considered that\
    \ there was not\n   sufficient interest in having a permanent allocation; therefore,\
    \ the\n   address block will be returned to the free pool.\n   Otherwise, if the\
    \ LISP working group recognizes that there is value\n   in having a permanent\
    \ allocation, then explicit action is needed.\n   In order to trigger the process\
    \ for a permanent allocation, a\n   document is required.  Such a document has\
    \ to articulate the\n   rationale for why a permanent allocation would be beneficial.\
    \  More\n   specifically, the document has to detail the experience gained during\n\
    \   experimentation and all of the technical benefits provided by the use\n  \
    \ of a LISP-specific prefix.  Such technical benefits are expected to\n   lay\
    \ in the scenarios described in Section 3.  However, new and\n   unforeseen benefits\
    \ may appear during experimentation.  The\n   description should be sufficiently\
    \ articulate that the needed size of\n   the permanent allocation can be estimated.\
    \  However, note that, as\n   explained in Section 6, it is up to IANA to decide\
    \ which address\n   block will be used as a permanent allocation and that such\
    \ a block\n   may be different from the temporary experimental allocation.\n"
- title: 8.  Routing Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Routing Considerations\n   In order to provide connectivity between the Legacy\
    \ Internet and LISP\n   sites, PITRs announcing large aggregates (ideally one\
    \ single, large\n   aggregate) of the IPv6 EID block could be deployed.  By doing\
    \ so,\n   PITRs will attract traffic destined for LISP sites in order to\n   encapsulate\
    \ and forward it toward the specific destination LISP site.\n   Routers in the\
    \ Legacy Internet must treat announcements of prefixes\n   from the IPv6 EID block\
    \ as normal announcements, applying best\n   current practices for traffic engineering\
    \ and security.\n   Even in a LISP site, not all routers need to run LISP elements.\
    \  In\n   particular, routers that are not at the border of the local domain,\n\
    \   used only for intra-domain routing, do not need to provide any\n   specific\
    \ LISP functionality but must be able to route traffic using\n   addresses in\
    \ the IPv6 EID block.\n   For the above-mentioned reasons, routers that do not\
    \ run any LISP\n   element must not include any special handling code or hardware\
    \ for\n   addresses in the IPv6 EID block.  In particular, it is recommended\n\
    \   that the default router configuration not handle such addresses in\n   any\
    \ special way.  Doing differently could prevent communication\n   between the\
    \ Legacy Internet and LISP sites or even break local intra-\n   domain connectivity.\n"
