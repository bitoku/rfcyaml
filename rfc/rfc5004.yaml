- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   In this document, we propose an extension to the BGP route selection\n\
    \   rules that would avoid unnecessary best path transitions between\n   external\
    \ paths under certain conditions.  The proposed extension\n   would help the overall\
    \ network stability, and more importantly, would\n   eliminate certain BGP route\
    \ oscillations in which more than one\n   external path from one BGP speaker contributes\
    \ to the churn.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The last two steps of the BGP route selection (Section 9.1.2.2,\n\
    \   [BGP]) involve comparing the BGP identifiers and the peering\n   addresses.\
    \  The BGP identifier (treated either as an IP address or\n   just an integer\
    \ [BGP-ID]) for a BGP speaker is allocated by the\n   Autonomous System (AS) to\
    \ which the speaker belongs.  As a result,\n   for a local BGP speaker, the BGP\
    \ identifier of a route received from\n   an external peer is just a random number.\
    \  When routes under\n   consideration are from external peers, the result from\
    \ the last two\n   steps of the route selection is therefore \"random\" as far\
    \ as the\n   local BGP speaker is concerned.\n   It is based on this observation\
    \ that we propose an extension to the\n   BGP route selection rules that would\
    \ avoid unnecessary best-path\n   transitions between external paths under certain\
    \ conditions.  The\n   proposed extension would help the overall network stability,\
    \ and more\n   importantly, would eliminate certain BGP route oscillations in\
    \ which\n   more than one external path from one BGP speaker contributes to the\n\
    \   churn.\n"

- title: 3.  The Algorithm
  contents:
  - "3.  The Algorithm\n   Consider the case in which the existing best path A is\
    \ from an\n   external peer, and another external path B is then selected as the\n\
    \   new best path by the route selection algorithm described in [BGP].\n   When\
    \ comparing all the paths in route selection, if neither Path A\n   nor Path B\
    \ is eliminated by the route selection algorithm prior to\n   Step f) -- BGP identifier\
    \ comparison (Section 9.1.2.2, [BGP]) -- we\n   propose that the existing best\
    \ path (Path A) be kept as the best path\n   (thus avoiding switching the best\
    \ path to Path B).\n   This algorithm SHOULD NOT be applied when either path is\
    \ from a BGP\n   Confederation peer.\n   In addition, the algorithm SHOULD NOT\
    \ be applied when both paths are\n   from peers with an identical BGP identifier\
    \ (i.e., there exist\n   parallel BGP sessions between two BGP speakers).  As\
    \ the peering\n   addresses for the parallel sessions are typically allocated\
    \ by one AS\n   (possibly with route selection considerations), the algorithm\
    \ (if\n   applied) could impact the existing routing setup.  Furthermore, by\n\
    \   not applying the algorithm, the allocation of peering addresses would\n  \
    \ remain as a simple and effective tool in influencing route selection\n   when\
    \ parallel BGP sessions exist.\n"
- title: 4.  The Benefits
  contents:
  - "4.  The Benefits\n   The proposed extension to the BGP route selection rules\
    \ avoids\n   unnecessary best-path transitions between external paths under\n\
    \   certain conditions.  Clearly, the extension would help reduce routing\n  \
    \ and forwarding changes in a network, thus helping the overall network\n   stability.\n\
    \   More importantly, as shown in the following example, the proposed\n   extension\
    \ can be used to eliminate certain BGP route oscillations in\n   which more than\
    \ one external path from one BGP speaker contributes to\n   the churn.  Note however,\
    \ that there are permanent BGP route\n   oscillation scenarios [RFC3345] that\
    \ the mechanism described in this\n   document does not eliminate.\n   Consider\
    \ the example in Figure 1 where\n      o R1, R2, R3, and R4 belong to one AS.\n\
    \      o R1 is a route reflector with R3 as its client.\n      o R2 is a route\
    \ reflector with R4 as its client.\n      o The IGP metrics are as listed.\n \
    \     o External paths (a), (b), and (c) are as described in Figure 2.\n     \

    \ reflection [BGP-RR] and the\n   MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED) attribute, the best path\
    \ on R1 keeps churning\n   between (a) and (c), and the best path on R3 keeps\
    \ churning between\n   (a) and (b).\n   With the proposed algorithm, R3 would\
    \ not switch the best path from\n   (a) to (b) even after R1 withdraws (c) toward\
    \ its clients, and that\n   is enough to stop the route oscillation.\n   Although\
    \ this type of route oscillation can also be eliminated by\n   other route reflection\
    \ enhancements being developed, the proposed\n   algorithm is extremely simple\
    \ and can be implemented and deployed\n   immediately without introducing any\
    \ backward compatibility issues.\n"
- title: 5.  Remarks
  contents:
  - "5.  Remarks\n   The proposed algorithm is backward-compatible, and can be deployed\
    \ on\n   a per-BGP-speaker basis.  The deployment of the algorithm is highly\n\
    \   recommended on a BGP speaker with multiple external BGP peers\n   (especially\
    \ the ones connecting to an inter-exchange point).\n   Compared to the existing\
    \ behavior, the proposed algorithm may\n   introduce some \"non-determinism\"\
    \ in the BGP route selection --\n   although one can argue that the BGP Identifier\
    \ comparison in the\n   existing route selection has already introduced some \"\
    randomness\" as\n   described in the introduction section.  Such \"non-determinism\"\
    \ has\n   not been shown to be detrimental in practice and can be completely\n\
    \   eliminated by using the existing mechanisms (such as setting\n   LOCAL_PREF\
    \ or MED) if so desired.\n"
