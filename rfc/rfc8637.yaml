    \ refers to the\n   set of virtual network (VN) operations needed to orchestrate,\n\
    \   control, and manage large-scale multidomain TE networks so as to\n   facilitate\
    \ network programmability, automation, efficient resource\n   sharing, and end-to-end\
    \ virtual service-aware connectivity and\n   network function virtualization services.\n\
    \   The Path Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655] is a component,\n   application,\
    \ or network node that is capable of computing a network\n   path or route based\
    \ on a network graph and applying computational\n   constraints.  The PCE serves\
    \ requests from Path Computation Clients\n   (PCCs) that communicate with it over\
    \ a local API or using the Path\n   Computation Element Communication Protocol\
    \ (PCEP).\n   This document examines the PCE and ACTN architecture and describes\n\
    \   how PCE architecture is applicable to ACTN.  It also lists the PCEP\n   extensions\
    \ that are needed to use PCEP as an ACTN interface.  This\n   document also identifies\
    \ any gaps in PCEP that exist at the time of\n   publication of this document.\n\
    \   Further, ACTN, stateful Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE) [PCE-HPCE], and PCE\n   as\
    \ a central controller (PCECC) [RFC8283] are based on the same basic\n   hierarchy\
    \ framework and are thus compatible with each other.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Path Computation Element (PCE)\n   The Path Computation Element Communication\
    \ Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440]\n   provides mechanisms for Path Computation Clients\
    \ (PCCs) to request a\n   Path Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655] to perform\
    \ path\n   computations.\n   The ability to compute shortest constrained TE LSPs\
    \ in Multiprotocol\n   Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks\
    \ across\n   multiple domains has been identified as a key motivation for PCE\n\
    \   development.\n   A stateful PCE [RFC8231] is capable of considering, for the\
    \ purposes\n   of path computation, not only the network state in terms of links\
    \ and\n   nodes (referred to as the Traffic Engineering Database or TED), but\n\
    \   also the status of active services (previously computed paths), and\n   currently\
    \ reserved resources, stored in the Label Switched Paths\n   Database (LSP-DB).\n\
    \   [RFC8051] describes general considerations for a stateful PCE\n   deployment\
    \ and examines its applicability and benefits as well as its\n   challenges and\
    \ limitations through a number of use cases.\n   [RFC8231] describes a set of\
    \ extensions to PCEP to provide stateful\n   control.  A stateful PCE has access\
    \ to not only the information\n   carried by the network's Interior Gateway Protocol\
    \ (IGP), but also\n   the set of active paths and their reserved resources for\
    \ its\n   computations.  The additional state allows the PCE to compute\n   constrained\
    \ paths while considering individual LSPs and their\n   interactions.  [RFC8281]\
    \ describes the setup, maintenance, and\n   teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under\
    \ the stateful PCE model.\n   [RFC8231] also describes the active stateful PCE.\
    \  The active PCE\n   functionality allows a PCE to reroute an existing LSP or\
    \ make changes\n   to the attributes of an existing LSP, or a PCC to delegate\
    \ control of\n   specific LSPs to a new PCE.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  Role of PCE in SDN
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Role of PCE in SDN\n   Software-Defined Networking (SDN) [RFC7149] refers\
    \ to a separation\n   between the control elements and the forwarding components\
    \ so that\n   software running in a centralized system, called a controller, can\n\
    \   act to program the devices in the network to behave in specific ways.\n  \
    \ A required element in an SDN architecture is a component that plans\n   how\
    \ the network resources will be used and how the devices will be\n   programmed.\
    \  It is possible to view this component as performing\n   specific computations\
    \ to place flows within the network given\n   knowledge of the availability of\
    \ network resources, how other\n   forwarding devices are programmed, and the\
    \ way that other flows are\n   routed.  It is concluded in [RFC7399] that this\
    \ is the same function\n   that a PCE might offer in a network operated using\
    \ a dynamic control\n   plane.  This is the function and purpose of a PCE, and\
    \ the way that a\n   PCE integrates into a wider network control system including\

  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  PCE in Multidomain and Multilayer Deployments\n   Computing paths across\
    \ large multidomain environments requires\n   special computational components\
    \ and cooperation between entities in\n   different domains capable of complex\
    \ path computation.  The PCE\n   provides an architecture and a set of functional\
    \ components to\n   address this problem space.  A PCE may be used to compute\
    \ end-to-end\n   paths across multidomain environments using a per-domain path\n\
    \   computation technique [RFC5152].  The Backward-Recursive PCE-based\n   path\
    \ computation (BRPC) mechanism [RFC5441] defines a PCE-based path\n   computation\
    \ procedure to compute interdomain-constrained MPLS and\n   GMPLS TE networks.\
    \  However, per-domain technique assumes that the\n   sequence of domains to be\
    \ crossed from source to destination is\n   known, either fixed by the network\
    \ operator or obtained by other\n   means.  BRPC can work best with a known domain\
    \ sequence, and it will\n   also work nicely with a small set of interconnected\
    \ domains.\n   However, it doesn't work well for a large set of interconnected\n\
    \   domains.\n   [RFC6805] describes a Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE) architecture that\
    \ can\n   be used for computing end-to-end paths for interdomain MPLS Traffic\n\
    \   Engineering (TE) and GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) when the\n   domain\
    \ sequence is not known.  Within the Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE)\n   architecture,\
    \ the Parent PCE (P-PCE) is used to compute a multidomain\n   path based on the\
    \ domain connectivity information.  A Child PCE\n   (C-PCE) may be responsible\
    \ for a single domain or multiple domains;\n   it is used to compute the intradomain\
    \ path based on its domain\n   topology information.\n   [PCE-HPCE] states the\
    \ considerations for stateful PCEs in\n   Hierarchical PCE architecture.  In particular,\
    \ the behavior changes\n   and adds to the existing stateful PCE mechanisms (including\
    \ PCE-\n   initiated LSP setup and active PCE usage) in the context of networks\n\
    \   using the H-PCE architecture.\n   [RFC5623] describes a framework for applying\
    \ the PCE-based\n   architecture to interlayer (G)MPLS TE.  It provides suggestions\
    \ for\n   the deployment of PCE in support of multilayer networks.  It also\n\
    \   describes the relationship between PCE and a functional component in\n   charge\
    \ of the control and management of the Virtual Network Topology\n   (VNT) [RFC5212]\
    \ called the VNT Manager (VNTM).\n"

- title: 3.  Architectural Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Architectural Considerations\n   The ACTN architecture [RFC8453] is based\
    \ on the hierarchy and\n   recursiveness of controllers.  It defines three types\
    \ of controllers\n   (depending on the functionalities they implement).  The main\n\
    \   functionalities are:\n   o  Multidomain coordination\n   o  Abstraction\n\
    \   o  Customer mapping/translation\n   o  Virtual service coordination\n   Section\
    \ 3 of [RFC8453] describes these functions.\n   It should be noted that this document\
    \ lists all possible ways in\n   which PCE could be used for each of the above\
    \ functions, but all\n   functions are not required to be implemented via PCE.\
    \  Similarly,\n   this document presents the ways in which PCEP could be used\
    \ as the\n   communications medium between functional components.  Operators may\n\
    \   choose to use the PCEP for multidomain coordination via stateful\n   H-PCE\
    \ but alternatively use Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)\n   [RFC6241],\
    \ RESTCONF [RFC8040], or BGP - Link State (BGP-LS) [RFC7752]\n   to get access\
    \ to the topology and support abstraction function.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Multidomain Coordination via Hierarchy
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Multidomain Coordination via Hierarchy\n   With the definition of domain\
    \ being everything that is under the\n   control of the single logical controller,\
    \ as per [RFC8453], it is\n   needed both to have a control entity that oversees\
    \ the specific\n   aspects of the different domains and to build a single abstracted\n\
    \   end-to-end network topology in order to coordinate end-to-end path\n   computation\
    \ and path/service provisioning.\n   The MDSC in ACTN framework realizes this\
    \ function by coordinating the\n   per-domain PNCs in a hierarchy of controllers.\
    \  It also needs to\n   detach from the underlying network technology and express\
    \ customer\n   concerns by business needs.\n   [RFC6805] and [PCE-HPCE] describe\
    \ a hierarchy of PCEs with the Parent\n   PCE coordinating multidomain path computation\
    \ function between Child\n   PCEs.  It is easy to see how these principles align,\
    \ and thus how the\n   stateful H-PCE architecture can be used to realize ACTN.\n\
    \   The per-domain stitched LSP in the Hierarchical stateful PCE\n   architecture,\
    \ described in Section 3.3.1 of [PCE-HPCE], is well\n   suited for multidomain\
    \ coordination function.  This includes domain\n   sequence selection, End-to-End\
    \ (E2E) path computation, and\n   controller-initiated (PCE-initiated) path setup\
    \ and reporting.  This\n   is also applicable to multilayer coordination in case\
    \ of IP+optical\n   networks.\n   [PCE-STATE-SYNC] describes the procedures to\
    \ allow a stateful\n   communication between PCEs for various use cases.  The\
    \ procedures and\n   extensions are also applicable to Child and Parent PCE communication\n\
    \   and are thus useful for ACTN as well.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Abstraction
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Abstraction\n   To realize ACTN, an abstracted view of the underlying network\n\
    \   resources needs to be built.  This includes global network-wide\n   abstracted\
    \ topology based on the underlying network resources of each\n   domain.  This\
    \ also includes abstract topology created as per the\n   customer service connectivity\
    \ requests and represented as a VN slice\n   allocated to each customer.\n   In\
    \ order to compute and provide optimal paths, PCEs require an\n   accurate and\
    \ timely Traffic Engineering Database (TED).\n   Traditionally, this TED has been\
    \ obtained from a link-state (LS)\n   routing protocol supporting traffic engineering\
    \ extensions.  PCE may\n   construct its TED by participating in the IGP ([RFC3630]\
    \ and\n   [RFC5305] for MPLS-TE; [RFC4203] and [RFC5307] for GMPLS).  An\n   alternative\
    \ is offered by BGP-LS [RFC7752].\n   In case of H-PCE [RFC6805], the Parent PCE\
    \ needs to build the domain\n   topology map of the child domains and their interconnectivity.\n\
    \   [RFC6805] and [PCE-INTER-AREA] suggest that BGP-LS could be used as a\n  \
    \ \"northbound\" TE advertisement from the Child PCE to the Parent PCE.\n   [PCEP-LS]\
    \ proposes another approach for learning and maintaining the\n   Link-State and\
    \ TE information as an alternative to IGPs and BGP\n   flooding, using PCEP itself.\
    \  The Child PCE can use this mechanism to\n   transport Link-State and TE information\
    \ from Child PCE to a Parent\n   PCE using PCEP.\n   In ACTN, there is a need\
    \ to control the level of abstraction based on\n   the deployment scenario and\
    \ business relationship between the\n   controllers.  The mechanism used to disseminate\
    \ information from the\n   PNC (Child PCE) to the MDSC (Parent PCE) should support\
    \ abstraction.\n   [RFC8453] describes a few alternative approaches of abstraction.\
    \  The\n   resulting abstracted topology can be encoded using the PCEP-LS\n  \
    \ mechanisms [PCEP-LS] and its optical network extension\n   [PCEP-OPTICAL]. \
    \ PCEP-LS is an attractive option when the operator\n   would wish to have a single\
    \ control-plane protocol (PCEP) to achieve\n   ACTN functions.\n   [RFC8453] discusses\
    \ two ways to build abstract topology from an MDSC\n   standpoint with interaction\
    \ with PNCs.  The primary method is called\n   automatic generation of abstract\
    \ topology by configuration.  With\n   this method, automatic generation is based\
    \ on the abstraction/\n   summarization of the whole domain by the PNC and its\
    \ advertisement on\n   the MPI.  The secondary method is called on-demand generation\
    \ of\n   supplementary topology via Path Compute Request/Reply.  This method\n\
    \   may be needed to obtain further complementary information such as\n   potential\
    \ connectivity from Child PCEs in order to facilitate an end-\n   to-end path\
    \ provisioning.  PCEP is well suited to support both\n   methods.\n"

  - "3.3.  Customer Mapping\n   In ACTN, there is a need to map customer virtual network\
    \ (VN)\n   requirements into a network provisioning request to the PNC.  That\n\
    \   is, the customer requests/commands are mapped by the MDSC into\n   network\
    \ provisioning requests that can be sent to the PNC.\n   Specifically, the MDSC\
    \ provides mapping and translation of a\n   customer's service request into a\
    \ set of parameters that are specific\n   to a network type and technology such\
    \ that the network configuration\n   process is made possible.\n   [RFC8281] describes\
    \ the setup, maintenance, and teardown of PCE-\n   initiated LSPs under the stateful\
    \ PCE model, without the need for\n   local configuration on the PCC, thus allowing\
    \ for a dynamic network\n   that is centrally controlled and deployed.  To instantiate\
    \ or delete\n   an LSP, the PCE sends the Path Computation LSP Initiate Request\n\
    \   (PCInitiate) message to the PCC.  As described in [PCE-HPCE], for\n   interdomain\
    \ LSP in Hierarchical PCE architecture, the initiation\n   operations can be carried\
    \ out at the Parent PCE.  In this case, after\n   Parent PCE finishes the E2E\
    \ path computation, it can send the\n   PCInitiate message to the Child PCE; the\
    \ Child PCE further propagates\n   the initiate request to the Label Switching\
    \ Router (LSR).  The\n   customer request is received by the MDSC (Parent PCE),\
    \ and, based on\n   the business logic, global abstracted topology, network conditions,\n\
    \   and local policy, the MDSC (Parent PCE) translates this into a per-\n   domain\
    \ LSP initiation request that a PNC (Child PCE) can understand\n   and act on.\
    \  This can be done via the PCInitiate message.\n   PCEP extensions for associating\
    \ opaque policy between PCEP peer\n   [ASSOC-POLICY] can be used.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Virtual Service Coordination
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Virtual Service Coordination\n   Virtual service coordination function\
    \ in ACTN incorporates customer\n   service-related information into the virtual\
    \ network service\n   operations in order to seamlessly operate virtual networks\
    \ while\n   meeting customers' service requirements.\n   [PCEP-VN] describes the\
    \ need for associating a set of LSPs with a VN\n   \"construct\" to facilitate\
    \ VN operations in PCE architecture.  This\n   association allows the PCEs to\
    \ identify which LSPs belong to a\n   certain VN.\n   This association based on\
    \ VN is useful for various optimizations at\n   the VN level, which can be applied\
    \ to all the LSPs that are part of\n   the VN slice.  During path computation,\
    \ the impact of a path for an\n   LSP is compared against the paths of other LSPs\
    \ in the VN.  This is\n   to ensure optimization and SLA attainment for the VN\
    \ rather than for\n   a single LSP.  Similarly, during reoptimization, advanced\
    \ path\n   computation algorithms and optimization techniques can be considered\n\
    \   for all the LSPs belonging to a VN/customer and optimize them all\n   together.\n"
- title: 4.  Interface Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Interface Considerations\n   As per [RFC8453], to allow virtualization and\
    \ multidomain\n   coordination, the network has to provide open, programmable\n\
    \   interfaces in which customer applications can create, replace, and\n   modify\
    \ virtual network resources and services in an interactive,\n   flexible, and\
    \ dynamic fashion while having no impact on other\n   customers.  The two ACTN\
    \ interfaces are as follows:\n   o  The CNC-MDSC Interface (CMI) is an interface\
    \ between a Customer\n      Network Controller and a Multidomain Service Coordinator.\
    \  It\n      requests the creation of the network resources, topology, or\n  \
    \    services for the applications.  The MDSC may also report potential\n    \
    \  network topology availability if queried for current capability\n      from\
    \ the Customer Network Controller.\n   o  The MDSC-PNC Interface (MPI) is an interface\
    \ between a Multidomain\n      Service Coordinator and a Provisioning Network\
    \ Controller.  It\n      communicates the creation request, if required, of new\n\
    \      connectivity of bandwidth changes in the physical network via the\n   \
    \   PNC.  In multidomain environments, the MDSC needs to establish\n      multiple\
    \ MPIs, one for each PNC, as there are multiple PNCs\n      responsible for its\
    \ domain control.\n   In the case of a hierarchy of MDSCs, the MPI is applied\
    \ recursively.\n   From an abstraction point of view, the top-level MDSC, which\n\
    \   interfaces the CNC, operates on a higher level of abstraction (i.e.,\n   less\
    \ granular level) than the lower-level MDSCs.\n   PCEP is especially suitable\
    \ on the MPI as it meets the requirement\n   and the functions as set out in the\
    \ ACTN framework [RFC8453].  Its\n   recursive nature is well suited via the multilevel\
    \ hierarchy of PCE.\n   PCEP can also be applied to the CMI as the CNC can be\
    \ a path\n   computation client while the MDSC can be a path computation server.\n\
    \   Section 5 describes how PCE and PCEP could help realize ACTN on the\n   MPI.\n"

    \ PCEP\n                          Figure 2: ACTN with PCE\n   o  Building Domain\
    \ Topology at MDSC: PNC (or Child PCE) needs to have\n      the TED to compute\
    \ the path in its domain.  As described in\n      Section 3.2, it can learn the\
    \ topology via IGP or BGP-LS.  PCEP-LS\n      is also a proposed mechanism to\
    \ carry link state and traffic\n      engineering information within PCEP.  A\
    \ mechanism to carry\n      abstracted topology while hiding technology-specific\
    \ information\n      between PNC and MDSC is described in [PCEP-LS].  At the end\
    \ of\n      this step, the MDSC (or Parent PCE) has the abstracted topology\n\
    \      from each of its PNCs (or Child PCE).  This could be as simple as\n   \
    \   a domain topology map as described in [RFC6805], or it can have\n      full\
    \ topology information of all domains.  The latter is not\n      scalable, and\
    \ thus, an abstracted topology of each domain\n      interconnected by interdomain\
    \ links is the most common case.\n      *  Topology Change: When the PNC learns\
    \ of any topology change,\n         the PNC needs to decide if the change needs\
    \ to be notified to\n         the MDSC.  This is dependent on the level of abstraction\n\
    \         between the MDSC and the PNC.\n   o  VN Instantiate: When an MDSC is\
    \ requested to instantiate a VN, the\n      minimal information that is required\
    \ would be a VN identifier and\n      a set of end points.  Various path computation,\
    \ setup constraints,\n      and objective functions may also be provided.  In\
    \ PCE terms, a VN\n      Instantiate can be considered as a set of paths belonging\
    \ to the\n      same VN.  As described in Section 3.4 and [PCEP-VN], the VN\n\
    \      association can help in identifying the set of paths that belong\n    \
    \  to a VN.  The rest of the information, like the endpoints,\n      constraints,\
    \ and objective function (OF), is already defined in\n      PCEP in terms of a\
    \ single path.\n      *  Path Computation: As per the example in Figure 2, the\
    \ VN\n         instantiate requires two end-to-end paths between (A in Domain\n\
    \         1 to B in Domain 3) and (A in Domain 1 to C in Domain 4).  The\n   \
    \      MDSC (or Parent PCE) triggers the end-to-end path computation\n       \
    \  for these two paths.  MDSC can do path computation based on the\n         abstracted\
    \ domain topology that it already has, or it may use\n         the H-PCE procedures\
    \ (Section 3.1) using the PCReq and PCRep\n         messages to get the end-to-end\
    \ path with the help of the Child\n         PCEs (PNC).  Either way, the resultant\
    \ E2E paths may be broken\n         into per-domain paths.\n      *  A-B: (A-B13,B13-B31,B31-B)\n\
    \      *  A-C: (A-B13,B13-B31,B31-B34,B34-B43,B43-C)\n      *  Per-Domain Path\
    \ Instantiation: Based on the above path\n         computation, MDSC can issue\
    \ the path instantiation request to\n         each PNC via PCInitiate message\
    \ (see [PCE-HPCE] and [PCEP-VN]).\n         A suitable stitching mechanism would\
    \ be used to stitch these\n         per-domain LSPs.  One such mechanism is described\
    \ in\n         [PCE-INTERDOMAIN], where PCEP is extended to support stitching\n\
    \         in stateful H-PCE context.\n      *  Per-Domain Path Report: Each PNC\
    \ should report the status of\n         the per-domain LSP to the MDSC via PCRpt\
    \ message, as per the\n         hierarchy of stateful PCEs ([PCE-HPCE]).  The\
    \ status of the\n         end-to-end LSP (A-B and A-C) is made up when all the\
    \ per-domain\n         LSPs are reported up by the PNCs.\n      *  Delegation:\
    \ It is suggested that the per-domain LSPs are\n         delegated to respective\
    \ PNCs so that they can control the path\n         and attributes based on the\
    \ conditions of each domain network.\n      *  State Synchronization: The state\
    \ needs to be synchronized\n         between the Parent PCE and Child PCE.  The\
    \ mechanism described\n         in [PCE-STATE-SYNC] can be used.\n   o  VN Modify:\
    \ MDSC is requested to modify a VN, for example, the\n      bandwidth for VN is\
    \ increased.  This may trigger path computation\n      at MDSC as described in\
    \ the previous step and can trigger an\n      update to an existing per-intradomain\
    \ path (via PCUpd message) or\n      the creation (or deletion) of a per-domain\
    \ path (via PCInitiate\n      message).  As described in [PCE-HPCE], this should\
    \ be done in\n      make-before-break fashion.\n   o  VN Delete: MDSC is requested\
    \ to delete a VN, in this case, based\n      on the E2E paths, and the resulting\
    \ per-domain paths need to be\n      removed (via PCInitiate message).\n   o \
    \ VN Update (based on network changes): Any change in the per-domain\n      LSP\
    \ is reported to the MDSC (via PCRpt message) as per [PCE-HPCE].\n      This may\
    \ result in changes in the E2E path or VN status.  This may\n      also trigger\
    \ a reoptimization leading to a new per-domain path, an\n      update to an existing\
    \ path, or the deletion of the path.\n   o  VN Protection: The VN protection/restoration\
    \ requirements need to\n      be applied to each E2E path as well as each per-domain\
    \ path.  The\n      MDSC needs to play a crucial role in coordinating the right\n\
    \      protection/restoration policy across each PNC.  The existing\n      protection/restoration\
    \ mechanism of PCEP can be applied on each\n      path.\n   o  In case a PNC generates\
    \ an abstract topology towards the MDSC, the\n      PCInitiate/PCUpd messages\
    \ from the MDSC to a PNC will contain a\n      path with abstract nodes and links.\
    \  A PNC would need to take that\n      as an input for path computation to get\
    \ a path with physical nodes\n      and links.  Similarly, a PNC would convert\
    \ the path received from\n      the device (with physical nodes and links) into\
    \ an abstract path\n      (based on the abstract topology generated before with\
    \ abstract\n      nodes and links) and report it to the MDSC.\n"

    \ key components and\n   interfaces for managed traffic-engineered networks. \
    \ It also lists\n   various security considerations such as request and control\
    \ of\n   resources, confidentially of the information, and availability of\n \
    \  function, which should be taken into consideration.\n   As per [RFC8453], securing\
    \ the request and control of resources,\n   confidentiality of the information,\
    \ and availability of function\n   should all be critical security considerations\
    \ when deploying and\n   operating ACTN platforms.  From a security and reliability\n\
    \   perspective, ACTN may encounter many risks such as malicious attack\n   and\
    \ rogue elements attempting to connect to various ACTN components\n   (with PCE\
    \ being one of them).  Furthermore, some ACTN components\n   represent a single\

    \ and eavesdropping of communication between\n   different ACTN components.  [RFC8453]\
    \ further states that all\n   protocols used to realize the ACTN framework should\
    \ have rich\n   security features, and customer, application, and network data\
    \ should\n   be stored in encrypted data stores.  When PCEP is used as an ACTN\n\

    \ a TLS or HTTPS connection between the\n   MDSC and PNCs, to ensure trust between\
    \ the physical network layer\n   control components and the MDSC.  Which MDSC\
    \ the PNC exports topology\n   information to, and the level of detail (full or\

  - "Appendix A.  Additional Information\n   In the paper [EXP], the application of\
    \ the ACTN architecture is\n   presented to demonstrate the control of a multidomain\
    \ flexi-grid\n   optical network by proposing, adopting, and extending:\n   o\
    \  the Hierarchical active stateful PCE architectures and protocols\n   o  the\
    \ PCEP protocol to support efficient and incremental link-state\n      topological\
    \ reporting, known as PCEP-LS\n   o  the per-link partitioning of the optical\
    \ spectrum based on\n      variable-sized allocated frequency slots enabling network\
    \ sharing\n      and virtualization\n   o  the use of a model-based interface\
    \ to dynamically request the\n      instantiation of virtual networks for specific\
    \ clients/tenants.\n   The design and implementation of the test bed are reported\
    \ in order\n   to validate the approach.\n"
