- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, [RFC6116]) is a system that\
    \ uses DNS\n   (Domain Name Service, [RFC1034]) to translate telephone numbers,\
    \ such\n   as '+44 1632 960123', into URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,\n  \
    \ [RFC3986]), such as 'acct:user@example.com'.  ENUM exists primarily\n   to facilitate\
    \ the interconnection of systems that rely on telephone\n   numbers with those\
    \ that use URIs to identify resources.\n   [RFC7565] defines the 'acct' URI scheme\
    \ as a way to identify a user's\n   account at a service provider.\n   This document\
    \ registers an Enumservice for advertising 'acct' URI\n   information associated\
    \ with an E.164 number.\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\

  contents:
  - '3.  Use Cases

    '
- title: 3.1.  Reverse Phone Lookup
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Reverse Phone Lookup\n   In this example, an address book application could\
    \ issue ENUM queries\n   looking for 'acct' URIs corresponding to phone numbers.\
    \  This could\n   be used to display the account identifier as well as an icon\
    \ based on\n   the host (domain) portion of that URI.\n   Similarly, an endpoint\
    \ could trigger this resolution process during\n   inbound and/or outbound calls\
    \ to discover an account associated with\n   the remote party.\n   In general,\
    \ the provision of an ENUM record to map a phone number\n   into an account may\
    \ be useful for businesses or professional workers\n   to identify themselves\
    \ publicly (in a way similar to vCard ENUM\n   records).\n"
- title: 3.2.  Routing of Mobile Social Communications
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Routing of Mobile Social Communications\n   The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA)\
    \ develops mobile service enabler\n   specifications, which support the creation\
    \ of interoperable\n   end-to-end mobile services independent of the underlying\
    \ wireless\n   platforms, such as GSM (Global System for Mobile communications),\n\
    \   UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System), and LTE (Long Term\n  \
    \ Evolution) mobile networks.  The OMA Social Network Web (SNeW)\n   Enabler Release\
    \ [OMA-SNeW] has introduced a number of social\n   networking functionalities\
    \ for mobile subscribers identified by their\n   MSISDN (Mobile Subscriber Integrated\
    \ Services Digital Network number,\n   a number uniquely identifying a subscription\
    \ in a mobile network),\n   amongst which is the ability to follow each other's\
    \ social activities\n   across service providers.\n   Such functionality requires\
    \ the global resolution of the MSISDN to\n   the corresponding account and provider,\
    \ in a way analogous to\n   Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) routing, to identify\
    \ the target\n   endpoint for the related messages.  Although alternative solutions\n\
    \   exist (e.g., based on mobile network operations and/or proprietary\n   lookup\
    \ techniques), ENUM provides a globally accessible mechanism for\n   enabling\
    \ resolution from network entities on behalf of an endpoint,\n   or from an endpoint\
    \ itself.\n   For example, a user of a service provider could request to follow\
    \ the\n   social activities of user '+44 1632 960123'.  The home SNeW Server of\n\
    \   the former user could perform an ENUM query to identify the 'acct'\n   URI\
    \ corresponding to that phone number.  Based on the resulting URI,\n   the server\
    \ could then identify the SNeW Server of the target user and\n   route the original\
    \ user's request to the appropriate endpoint.\n   A similar mechanism can apply\
    \ to other types of social networking-\n   related messages or other communications\
    \ targeted to a mobile\n   subscriber.\n"

- title: 5.  Examples
  contents:
  - "5.  Examples\n   The following is an example of the use of the Enumservice registered\n\
    \   by this document in a Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) resource\n   record\
    \ for phone number +44 1632 960123.\n   $ORIGIN 3.2.1.0.6.9.2.3.6.1.4.4.e164.arpa.\n\
    \   IN NAPTR 10 100 \"u\" \"E2U+acct\" \"!^.*$!acct:441632960123@foo.com!\" .\n\
    \   IN NAPTR 10 101 \"u\" \"E2U+acct\" \"!^.*$!acct:john.doe@example.com!\" .\n\
    \   Note that in the first record, the revealed information is limited to\n  \
    \ the domain of the service provider serving that user, as the userpart\n   of\
    \ the 'acct' URI simply replicates the phone number.\n"
- title: 6.  DNS Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  DNS Considerations\n   There may not be any \"E2U+acct\" NAPTRs returned\
    \ in response to the\n   original ENUM query on the requested telephone number,\
    \ but other\n   terminal ENUM NAPTRs that include tel: URLs [RFC3966] (e.g.,\n\
    \   \"voice:tel\", \"pstn:tel\", \"sms:tel\", or \"mms:tel\" -- see [RFC6118])\n\
    \   may be present.\n   The application that made that ENUM query may choose to\
    \ resubmit ENUM\n   queries for any E.164 numbers included in those returned terminal\n\
    \   NAPTRs.  Doing so may cause a query loop (e.g., the ENUM records\n   returned\
    \ from subsequent queries may refer to the telephone number\n   already considered).\
    \  If applications choose to perform subsequent\n   ENUM queries using telephone\
    \ numbers retrieved from earlier queries,\n   these applications MUST be aware\
    \ of the potential for query loops and\n   MUST be prepared to abort the set of\
    \ queries if such a loop is\n   detected.\n   This issue is similar to the referential\
    \ loop issue caused by\n   processing non-terminal NAPTR queries, as mentioned\
    \ in Section 5.2.1\n   of [RFC6116], and a similar technique to mitigate this\
    \ issue can be\n   used; an application searching for records with \"acct\" Enumservice\n\
    \   may consider that submitting a chain of more than 5 ENUM queries\n   without\
    \ finding such a record indicates that a referential loop has\n   been entered,\
    \ and the chain of queries SHOULD be abandoned.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   DNS, as used by ENUM, is a global, distributed\
    \ database.  Should\n   implementers of this specification use e164.arpa or any\
    \ other\n   publicly available domain as the tree for maintaining Public Switched\n\
    \   Telephone Network (PSTN) Enumservice data, this information would be\n   visible\
    \ to anyone anonymously.\n   Carriers, service providers, and other users may\
    \ choose not to\n   publish such information in the public e164.arpa tree.  They\
    \ may\n   instead simply publish this in an internal ENUM infrastructure that\n\
    \   is only able to be queried by trusted elements of their network, thus\n  \
    \ limiting threats.\n   For security considerations that apply to all Enumservices,\
    \ please\n   refer to [RFC6116], Section 7.\n   It is important to note that the\
    \ ENUM record itself does not need to\n   contain any personal information but\
    \ only contains a pointer to an\n   account identifier.  This identifier may be\
    \ queried to discover\n   pointers to personal information (e.g., social-network\
    \ information)\n   endpoints, and an authorization mechanism may be in place in\
    \ that\n   context with any level of granularity; these topics are out of scope\n\
    \   for this document.\n   Technically, ENUM records themselves could contain\
    \ pointers to the\n   same endpoints.  However, the visibility of ENUM records\
    \ cannot be\n   controlled based on the requesting entity.  In that context, the\n\
    \   simple mapping of the phone number to the account identifier,\n   notwithstanding\
    \ the disclosure of the association itself, still\n   enables the reuse of more\
    \ advanced access policies.\n   Revealing an 'acct' URI by itself is unlikely\
    \ to introduce many\n   privacy concerns, although, depending on the structure\
    \ of the URI, it\n   might reveal the full name or employer of the target.  The\
    \ use of\n   anonymous URIs mitigates this risk.\n   Unlike a traditional telephone\
    \ number, the endpoint identified by an\n   'acct' URI may require that requesting\
    \ entities provide cryptographic\n   credentials for authentication and authorization\
    \ before messages are\n   exchanged.  ENUM can actually provide far greater protection\
    \ from\n   unwanted requesting entities than does the existing PSTN, despite the\n\
    \   public availability of ENUM records.\n   More serious security concerns are\
    \ associated with potential attacks\n   against an underlying system (for example,\
    \ a social-network system)\n   using the 'acct' URI.  For this reason, the underlying\
    \ system should\n   have a number of security requirements that call for authentication,\n\
    \   integrity, and confidentiality properties, and similar measures to\n   prevent\
    \ such attacks.  This is out of scope for this document.\n"
