  - "1.  Introduction\n   An extension to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) [RFC5036]\n\
    \   defines the general notion of a \"Typed Wildcard Forwarding\n   Equivalence\
    \ Class (FEC) Element\" [RFC5918].  This can be used when\n   requesting, releasing,\
    \ or withdrawing all label bindings for a given\n   type of FEC Element is desired.\
    \  However, a Typed Wildcard FEC\n   Element must be individually defined for\
    \ each type of FEC Element.\n   [RFC4447] defines the \"PWid FEC Element\" and\
    \ \"Generalized PWid FEC\n   Element\", but does not specify the Typed Wildcard\
    \ format for these\n   elements.  This document specifies the format of the Typed\
    \ Wildcard\n   FEC Element for the \"PWid FEC Element\" and \"Generalized PWid\
    \ FEC\n   Element\".  The procedures for Typed Wildcard processing for PWid and\n\
    \   Generalized PWid FEC Elements are the same as described in [RFC5918]\n   for\
    \ any Typed Wildcard FEC Element type.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"

    \ can be used for\n   wildcard withdrawal or status messages related to Generalized\
    \ PWid\n   FECs.  When the Typed Wildcard FEC for Generalized PWid FEC element\n\
    \   is in use, the \"PW Grouping ID TLV\" MUST NOT be present in the same\n  \
    \ message.  If present, the receiving Label Switching Router (LSR) MUST\n   ignore\
    \ this TLV silently and process the rest of the message.\n"
- title: 3.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "3.  Applicability Statement\n   The Typed Wildcard FEC Elements defined in this\
    \ document for the PWid\n   and Generalized PWid FEC Elements provide a finer\
    \ degree of\n   granularity when compared to the wildcard FEC mechanics defined\
    \ in\n   [RFC5036].\n   The PWid FEC Element as defined in [RFC4447] contains\
    \ a Group ID\n   field.  This field is defined as an arbitrary 32-bit value that\n\
    \   represents a group of PWs and is used to create groups in the PW\n   space,\
    \ including potentially a single group of all PWs for a given\n   FEC Element\
    \ type.  This grouping enables an LSR to send \"wildcard\"\n   label withdrawals\
    \ and/or status notification messages corresponding\n   to a PW group upon physical\
    \ port failures.  Similarly, [RFC4447]\n   defines the \"PW Grouping ID TLV\"\
    \ used in the same fashion for the\n   Generalized PWid FEC Element.\n   The PWid\
    \ Typed Wildcard FEC Elements defined in this document help us\n   achieve similar\
    \ functionality as the \"Group ID\" field or \"PW Grouping\n   ID TLV\" for label\
    \ withdrawal and status notification messages.\n   Additionally, the Typed Wildcard\
    \ procedures [RFC5918] provide a more\n   generalized and comprehensive solution\
    \ by allowing:\n   1. Typed Wildcard Label Request messages\n   2. Label TLVs\
    \ in label messages to further constrain the wildcard to\n      all FECs of the\
    \ specified FEC type [and its specific filter] that\n      are also bound to the\
    \ specified label.\n   This document allows use of the Typed Wildcard PW FEC Element\
    \ in any\n   LDP message that specifies a FEC TLV as a mandatory or optional\n\
    \   parameter of the message.  In addition to LDP label messages, this\n   also\
    \ applies to notification messages (containing PW Status) and\n   Address Withdraw\
    \ (for MAC address withdrawal [RFC4762]) messages in\n   the context of LDP PW\
    \ signaling.  When a Typed Wildcard PW FEC\n   Element is used in an Address Withdraw\
    \ message for Virtual Private\n   LAN Service (VPLS) Media Access Control (MAC)\
    \ address withdrawal, the\n   MAC List TLV MUST contain an empty list.\n"
- title: 4.  Operation
  contents:
  - "4.  Operation\n   The use of Typed Wildcard FEC Elements for PW can be useful\
    \ under\n   several scenarios.  This section describes some use cases to\n   illustrate\
    \ their application.  The following use cases consider two\n   LSR nodes, A and\
    \ B, with an LDP session between them to exchange\n   Layer 2 Virtual Private\
    \ Network (L2VPN) PW bindings.\n"
- title: 4.1.  PW Consistency Check
  contents:
  - "4.1.  PW Consistency Check\n   A user may request a control-plane consistency\
    \ check at LSR A for the\n   Generalized PWid FEC bindings that it learned from\
    \ LSR B over the LDP\n   session.  To perform this consistency check, LSR A marks\
    \ all its\n   learned Generalized PWid FEC bindings from LSR B as stale, and then\n\
    \   sends a Label Request message towards LSR B for the Typed Wildcard\n   FEC\
    \ Element for Generalized PWid FEC Element type with the PW type\n   set to \"\
    Wildcard\" (0x7FFF).  Upon receipt of such a request, LSR B\n   replays its database\
    \ related to the Generalized PWid FEC Element\n   using one or more Label Mapping\
    \ messages.  As a PW binding is\n   received at LSR A, the associated binding\
    \ state is marked as\n   refreshed (not stale).  When replay completes for the\
    \ Generalized\n   PWid FEC type, LSR B marks the end of its replay by sending\
    \ an\n   End-of-LIB notification [RFC5919] corresponding to the Generalized\n\
    \   PWid FEC Element type.  Upon receipt of this notification at LSR A,\n   any\
    \ remaining stale PW binding of the Generalized PWid FEC type\n   learned from\
    \ the peer LSR B is cleaned up and removed from the\n   database.  This completes\
    \ the consistency check with LSR B at LSR A\n   for Generalized PWid FEC type.\n"
- title: 4.2.  PW Graceful Shutdown
  contents:
  - "4.2.  PW Graceful Shutdown\n   It may be desirable to perform shutdown/removal\
    \ of existing PW\n   bindings advertised towards a peer in a graceful manner --\
    \ i.e., all\n   advertised PW bindings are to be removed from a peer without session\n\
    \   flap.  For example, to request a graceful delete of the PWid FEC and\n   Generalized\
    \ PWid FEC bindings at LSR A learned from LSR B, LSR A\n   would send a Label\
    \ Withdraw message towards LSR B with Typed Wildcard\n   FEC Elements pertaining\
    \ to the PWid FEC Element (with PW type set to\n   0x7FFF) and Generalized PWid\
    \ FEC Element (with PW type set to\n   0x7FFF).  Upon receipt of such a message,\
    \ LSR B would delete all PWid\n   and Generalized PWid bindings learned from LSR\
    \ A.  Afterwards, LSR B\n   would send Label Release messages corresponding to\
    \ received Label\n   Withdraw messages with the Typed FEC Element.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Wildcard PW Status
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Wildcard PW Status\n   The Typed Wildcard FEC Elements for PW FECs can\
    \ be very useful to\n   convey PW status amongst LSRs.  The Provider Edge (PE)\
    \ devices can\n   send the \"PW Status TLV\" in an LDP Notification message to\
    \ indicate\n   PW status (i.e., a Pseudowire Status Code denoting, for example,\
    \ a\n   particular fault) to their remote peers [RFC4447].  In case of a\n   global\
    \ failure affecting all PWs, an LSR typically sends one PW\n   Status LDP Notification\
    \ message per PW.  This per-PW-Status message\n   has scalability implications\
    \ in a large-scale network with a large\n   number of PWs.\n   Using Typed Wildcard\
    \ FEC Element for a given type of PW FEC Element,\n   the LSR will need to send\
    \ only one PW Status Notification message\n   with the Typed Wildcard PW FEC specified\
    \ to notify about the common\n   status applicable to all PWs as scoped by the\
    \ PW Typed Wildcard FEC.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Typed Wildcard MAC Withdrawal in VPLS
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Typed Wildcard MAC Withdrawal in VPLS\n   [RFC4762] defines a pseudowire-based\
    \ solution to implement Virtual\n   Private LAN Service (VPLS).  Section 6.2 of\
    \ RFC 4762 describes MAC\n   Withdrawal procedures and extensions in a VPLS environment.\
    \  These\n   procedures use the LDP Address Withdraw message containing the FEC\n\
    \   TLV (with the PW FEC element corresponding to the VPLS instance) and\n   MAC\
    \ List TLV (to specify addresses to be withdrawn).  The procedures\n   described\
    \ in RFC 4762 also allow MAC address withdrawal wildcarding\n   for a given VPLS\
    \ instance.\n   Using RFC 4762 procedures, a PE LSR can withdraw all MAC addresses\n\
    \   for a given VPLS instance by sending an Address Withdraw message with\n  \
    \ a VPLS instance corresponding to the PW FEC element in a FEC TLV, and\n   a\
    \ MAC List TLV with an empty list of addresses.  If there is more\n   than one\
    \ VPLS instance on a given PE LSR node, separate Address\n   Withdraw messages\
    \ need to be sent by the PE LSR if it wishes to\n   withdraw MAC addresses for\
    \ all or a subset of VPLS instances upon\n   some global failure or configuration.\
    \  Per-PW (VPLS instance) MAC\n   Withdraw message may have some scalability implications\
    \ in a large-\n   scale network.\n   As stated in Section 3, this document allows\
    \ use of the Typed\n   Wildcard PW FEC in Address Withdraw messages corresponding\
    \ to VPLS\n   MAC Withdrawal.  The use of PW Typed Wildcard FEC enhances the scope\n\
    \   of MAC withdrawal beyond just a single VPLS instance and allows a PE\n   node\
    \ to wildcard withdraw all MAC addresses for:\n      o  all VPLS instances; or\n\
    \      o  all VPLS instances corresponding to a given PW type.\n"
