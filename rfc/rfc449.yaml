  - "              The Current Flow-control Scheme for IMPSYS.\n    While Vint's notes\
    \ on IMPSYS flow-control from the March 16, 1972,\nmeeting (RFC 442) seem reasonably\
    \ accurate and while he does cite our\nQuarterly Technical Report #13, he might\
    \ have done better to cite BBN's\ntwo formal publications relevant to the IMPSYS\
    \ flow-control scheme:\n    1.  McQuillan et al, Improvements in the Design and\
    \ Performance of\n        the ARPA Network, Proceedings AFIPS 1972 FJCC, pp. 741-754.\n\
    \    2.  BBN Report 1822, Specifications for the Interconnection of a\n      \
    \  Host and an IMP, December 1972 Revision, section 3, pp. 17-35.\nthings have\
    \ recently changed somewhat.\n    The inter-IMP acknowledgement mechanism, described\
    \ in the last\nsection of Vint's RFC 442, is also described in reference 1 and\
    \ an\nalmost identical mechanism is described in Appendix F of reference 2.\n\
    The acknowledgement is of only intellectual interest to most Hosts as it\nis transparent\
    \ to network users.  However, the description in reference\n2 is of vital interest\
    \ to so-called Very Distant Hosts.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable\
    \ form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by Alex McKenzie with\
