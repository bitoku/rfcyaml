- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC5328] registered the Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace\
    \ \"dvb\"\n   for the Digital Video Broadcasting Project.  Since the publication\
    \ of\n   that RFC, the registrant contact information has changed; this\n   document\
    \ updates the registrant information to make it current.  It\n   uses a role-based\
    \ email address to reduce the need for updates in the\n   future.\n"

    \ in Section 2\n   of RFC 5328.  The new information for those fields is as follows:\n\
    \   Registration Information:\n         Version: 2\n         Date: 2014-08-11\n\
