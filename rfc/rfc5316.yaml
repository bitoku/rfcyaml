  - "1.  Introduction\n   [ISIS-TE] defines extensions to the ISIS protocol [ISIS]\
    \ to support\n   intra-area Traffic Engineering (TE).  The extensions provide\
    \ a way of\n   encoding the TE information for TE-enabled links within the network\n\
    \   (TE links) and flooding this information within an area.  The\n   extended\
    \ IS reachability TLV and traffic engineering router ID TLV,\n   which are defined\
    \ in [ISIS-TE], are used to carry such TE\n   information.  The extended IS reachability\
    \ TLV has several nested\n   sub-TLVs that describe the TE attributes for a TE\
    \ link.\n   [ISIS-TE-V3] and [GMPLS-TE] define similar extensions to ISIS [ISIS]\n\
    \   in support of IPv6 and GMPLS traffic engineering, respectively.\n   Requirements\
    \ for establishing Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) TE\n   Label Switched\
    \ Paths (LSPs) that cross multiple Autonomous Systems\n   (ASes) are described\
    \ in [INTER-AS-TE-REQ].  As described in [INTER-\n   AS-TE-REQ], a method SHOULD\
    \ provide the ability to compute a path\n   spanning multiple ASes.  So a path\
    \ computation entity that may be the\n   head-end Label Switching Router (LSR),\
    \ an AS Border Router (ASBR), or\n   a Path Computation Element (PCE [PCE]) needs\
    \ to know the TE\n   information not only of the links within an AS, but also\
    \ of the links\n   that connect to other ASes.\n   In this document, a new TLV,\
    \ which is referred to as the inter-AS\n   reachability TLV, is defined to advertise\
    \ inter-AS TE information,\n   and three new sub-TLVs are defined for inclusion\
    \ in the inter-AS\n   reachability TLV to carry the information about the remote\
    \ AS number\n   and remote ASBR ID.  The sub-TLVs defined in [ISIS-TE], [ISIS-TE-V3],\n\
    \   and other documents for inclusion in the extended IS reachability TLV\n  \
    \ for describing the TE properties of a TE link are applicable to be\n   included\
    \ in the inter-AS reachability TLV for describing the TE\n   properties of an\
    \ inter-AS TE link as well.  Also, two more new sub-\n   TLVs are defined for\
    \ inclusion in the IS-IS router capability TLV to\n   carry the TE Router ID when\
    \ the TE Router ID needs to reach all\n   routers within an entire ISIS routing\
    \ domain.  The extensions are\n   equally applicable to IPv4 and IPv6 as identical\
    \ extensions to\n   [ISIS-TE] and [ISIS-TE-V3].  Detailed definitions and procedures\
    \ are\n   discussed in the following sections.\n   This document does not propose\
    \ or define any mechanisms to advertise\n   any other extra-AS TE information\
    \ within ISIS.  See Section 2.1 for a\n   full list of non-objectives for this\
    \ work.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Problem Statement\n   As described in [INTER-AS-TE-REQ], in the case of establishing\
    \ an\n   inter-AS TE LSP that traverses multiple ASes, the Path message\n   [RFC3209]\
    \ may include the following elements in the Explicit Route\n   Object (ERO) in\
    \ order to describe the path of the LSP:\n   -  a set of AS numbers as loose hops,\
    \ and/or\n   -  a set of LSRs including ASBRs as loose hops.\n   Two methods for\
    \ determining inter-AS paths are currently being\n   discussed.  The per-domain\
    \ method [PD-PATH] determines the path one\n   domain at a time.  The backward\
    \ recursive method [BRPC] uses\n   cooperation between PCEs to determine an optimum\
    \ inter-domain path.\n   The sections that follow examine how inter-AS TE link\
    \ information\n   could be useful in both cases.\n"
- title: 2.1.  A Note on Non-Objectives
  contents:
  - "2.1.  A Note on Non-Objectives\n   It is important to note that this document\
    \ does not make any change\n   to the confidentiality and scaling assumptions\
    \ surrounding the use of\n   ASes in the Internet.  In particular, this document\
    \ is conformant to\n   the requirements set out in [INTER-AS-TE-REQ].\n   The\
    \ following features are explicitly excluded:\n   o  There is no attempt to distribute\
    \ TE information from within one\n      AS to another AS.\n   o  There is no mechanism\
    \ proposed to distribute any form of TE\n      reachability information for destinations\
    \ outside the AS.\n   o  There is no proposed change to the PCE architecture or\
    \ usage.\n   o  TE aggregation is not supported or recommended.\n   o  There is\
    \ no exchange of private information between ASes.\n   o  No ISIS adjacencies\
    \ are formed on the inter-AS link.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Per-Domain Path Determination
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Per-Domain Path Determination\n   In the per-domain method of determining\
    \ an inter-AS path for an\n   MPLS-TE LSP, when an LSR that is an entry-point\
    \ to an AS receives a\n   Path message from an upstream AS with an ERO containing\
    \ a next hop\n   that is an AS number, it needs to find which LSRs (ASBRs) within\
    \ the\n   local AS are connected to the downstream AS.  That way, it can\n   compute\
    \ a TE LSP segment across the local AS to one of those LSRs and\n   forward the\
    \ Path message to that LSR and hence into the next AS.  See\n   Figure 1 for an\
    \ example.\n                R1------R3----R5-----R7------R9-----R11\n        \

    \                 Figure 1: Inter-AS Reference Model\n   The figure shows three\
    \ ASes (AS1, AS2, and AS3) and twelve LSRs (R1\n   through R12).  R3 and R4 are\
    \ ASBRs in AS1.  R5, R6, R7, and R8 are\n   ASBRs in AS2.  R9 and R10 are ASBRs\
    \ in AS3.\n   If an inter-AS TE LSP is planned to be established from R1 to R12,\n\
    \   the AS sequence will be: AS1, AS2, AS3.\n   Suppose that the Path message\
    \ enters AS2 from R3.  The next hop in\n   the ERO shows AS3, and R5 must determine\
    \ a path segment across AS2 to\n   reach AS3.  It has a choice of three exit points\
    \ from AS2 (R6, R7,\n   and R8), and it needs to know which of these provide TE\
    \ connectivity\n   to AS3, and whether the TE connectivity (for example, available\n\
    \   bandwidth) is adequate for the requested LSP.\n   Alternatively, if the next\
    \ hop in the ERO is the entry ASBR for AS3\n   (say R9), R5 needs to know which\
    \ of its exit ASBRs has a TE link that\n   connects to R9.  Since there may be\
    \ multiple ASBRs that are connected\n   to R9 (both R7 and R8 in this example),\
    \ R5 also needs to know the TE\n   properties of the inter-AS TE links so that\
    \ it can select the correct\n   exit ASBR.\n   Once the Path message reaches the\
    \ exit ASBR, any choice of inter-AS\n   TE link can be made by the ASBR if not\
    \ already made by the entry ASBR\n   that computed the segment.\n   More details\
    \ can be found in Section 4 of [PD-PATH], which clearly\n   points out why advertising\
    \ of inter-AS links is desired.\n   To enable R5 to make the correct choice of\
    \ exit ASBR, the following\n   information is needed:\n   o  List of all inter-AS\
    \ TE links for the local AS.\n   o  TE properties of each inter-AS TE link.\n\
    \   o  AS number of the neighboring AS connected to by each inter-AS TE\n    \
    \  link.\n   o  Identity (TE Router ID) of the neighboring ASBR connected to by\n\
    \      each inter-AS TE link.\n   In GMPLS networks, further information may also\
    \ be required to select\n   the correct TE links as defined in [GMPLS-TE].\n \
    \  The example above shows how this information is needed at the entry-\n   point\
    \ ASBRs for each AS (or the PCEs that provide computation\n   services for the\
    \ ASBRs).  However, this information is also needed\n   throughout the local AS\
    \ if path computation functionality is fully\n   distributed among LSRs in the\
    \ local AS, for example to support LSPs\n   that have start points (ingress nodes)\
    \ within the AS.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Backward Recursive Path Computation
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Backward Recursive Path Computation\n   Another scenario using PCE techniques\
    \ has the same problem.  [BRPC]\n   defines a PCE-based TE LSP computation method\
    \ (called Backward\n   Recursive Path Computation) to compute optimal inter-domain\n\
    \   constrained MPLS-TE or GMPLS LSPs.  In this path computation method,\n   a\
    \ specific set of traversed domains (ASes) are assumed to be selected\n   before\
    \ computation starts.  Each downstream PCE in domain(i) returns\n   to its upstream\
    \ neighbor PCE in domain(i-1) a multipoint-to-point\n   tree of potential paths.\
    \  Each tree consists of the set of paths from\n   all boundary nodes located\
    \ in domain(i) to the destination where each\n   path satisfies the set of required\
    \ constraints for the TE LSP\n   (bandwidth, affinities, etc.).\n   So a PCE needs\
    \ to select boundary nodes (that is, ASBRs) that provide\n   connectivity from\
    \ the upstream AS.  In order for the tree of paths\n   provided by one PCE to\
    \ its neighbor to be correlated, the identities\n   of the ASBRs for each path\
    \ need to be referenced.  Thus, the PCE must\n   know the identities of the ASBRs\
    \ in the remote AS that are reached by\n   any inter-AS TE link, and, in order\
    \ to provide only suitable paths in\n   the tree, the PCE must know the TE properties\
    \ of the inter-AS TE\n   links.  See the following figure as an example.\n   \
    \                PCE1<------>PCE2<-------->PCE3\n                   /       :\

    \               Figure 2: BRPC for Inter-AS Reference Model\n   The figure shows\
    \ three ASes (AS1, AS2, and AS3), three PCEs (PCE1,\n   PCE2, and PCE3), and twelve\
    \ LSRs (R1 through R12).  R3 and R4 are\n   ASBRs in AS1.  R5, R6, R7, and R8\
    \ are ASBRs in AS2.  R9 and R10 are\n   ASBRs in AS3.  PCE1, PCE2, and PCE3 cooperate\
    \ to perform inter-AS\n   path computation and are responsible for path segment\
    \ computation\n   within their own domain(s).\n   If an inter-AS TE LSP is planned\
    \ to be established from R1 to R12,\n   the traversed domains are assumed to be\
    \ selected: AS1->AS2->AS3, and\n   the PCE chain is: PCE1->PCE2->PCE3.  First,\
    \ the path computation\n   request originated from the PCC (R1) is relayed by\
    \ PCE1 and PCE2\n   along the PCE chain to PCE3.  Then, PCE3 begins to compute\
    \ the path\n   segments from the entry boundary nodes that provide connection\
    \ from\n   AS2 to the destination (R12).  But, to provide suitable path\n   segments,\
    \ PCE3 must determine which entry boundary nodes provide\n   connectivity to its\
    \ upstream neighbor AS (identified by its AS\n   number), and must know the TE\
    \ properties of the inter-AS TE links.\n   In the same way, PCE2 also needs to\
    \ determine the entry boundary\n   nodes according to its upstream neighbor AS\
    \ and the inter-AS TE link\n   capabilities.\n   Thus, to support Backward Recursive\
    \ Path Computation, the same\n   information listed in Section 2.2 is required.\
    \  The AS number of the\n   neighboring AS connected to by each inter-AS TE link\
    \ is particularly\n   important.\n"

- title: 4.  Procedure for Inter-AS TE Links
  contents:
  - "4.  Procedure for Inter-AS TE Links\n   When TE is enabled on an inter-AS link\
    \ and the link is up, the ASBR\n   SHOULD advertise this link using the normal\
    \ procedures for ISIS-TE\n   [ISIS-TE].  When either the link is down or TE is\
    \ disabled on the\n   link, the ASBR SHOULD withdraw the advertisement.  When\
    \ there are\n   changes to the TE parameters for the link (for example, when the\n\
    \   available bandwidth changes), the ASBR SHOULD re-advertise the link\n   but\
    \ MUST take precautions against excessive re-advertisements.\n   Hellos MUST NOT\
    \ be exchanged over the inter-AS link, and\n   consequently, an ISIS adjacency\
    \ MUST NOT be formed.\n   The information advertised comes from the ASBR's knowledge\
    \ of the TE\n   capabilities of the link, the ASBR's knowledge of the current\
    \ status\n   and usage of the link, and configuration at the ASBR of the remote\
    \ AS\n   number and remote ASBR TE Router ID.\n   Legacy routers receiving an\
    \ advertisement for an inter-AS TE link are\n   able to ignore it because they\
    \ do not know the new TLV and sub-TLVs\n   that are defined in Section 3 of this\
    \ document.  They will continue\n   to flood the LSP, but will not attempt to\
    \ use the information\n   received.\n   In the current operation of ISIS TE, the\
    \ LSRs at each end of a TE\n   link emit LSAs describing the link.  The databases\
    \ in the LSRs then\n   have two entries (one locally generated, the other from\
    \ the peer)\n   that describe the different 'directions' of the link.  This enables\n\
    \   Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) to do a two-way check on the\n   link\
    \ when performing path computation and eliminate it from\n   consideration unless\
    \ both directions of the link satisfy the required\n   constraints.\n   In the\
    \ case we are considering here (i.e., of a TE link to another\n   AS), there is,\
    \ by definition, no IGP peering and hence no\n   bidirectional TE link information.\
    \  In order for the CSPF route\n   computation entity to include the link as a\
    \ candidate path, we have\n   to find a way to get LSAs describing its (bidirectional)\
    \ TE\n   properties into the TE database.\n   This is achieved by the ASBR advertising,\
    \ internally to its AS,\n   information about both directions of the TE link to\
    \ the next AS.  The\n   ASBR will normally generate an LSA describing its own\
    \ side of a link;\n   here we have it 'proxy' for the ASBR at the edge of the\
    \ other AS and\n   generate an additional LSA that describes that device's 'view'\
    \ of the\n   link.\n   Only some essential TE information for the link needs to\
    \ be\n   advertised; i.e., the Interface Address, the remote AS number, and\n\
    \   the remote ASBR ID of an inter-AS TE link.\n   Routers or PCEs that are capable\
    \ of processing advertisements of\n   inter-AS TE links SHOULD NOT use such links\
    \ to compute paths that\n   exit an AS to a remote ASBR and then immediately re-enter\
    \ the AS\n   through another TE link.  Such paths would constitute extremely rare\n\
    \   occurrences and SHOULD NOT be allowed except as the result of\n   specific\
    \ policy configurations at the router or PCE computing the\n   path.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Origin of Proxied TE Information
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Origin of Proxied TE Information\n   Section 4 describes how an ASBR advertises\
    \ TE link information as a\n   proxy for its neighbor ASBR, but does not describe\
    \ where this\n   information comes from.\n   Although the source of this information\
    \ is outside the scope of this\n   document, it is possible that it will be a\
    \ configuration requirement\n   at the ASBR, as are other local properties of\
    \ the TE link.  Further,\n   where BGP is used to exchange IP routing information\
    \ between the\n   ASBRs, a certain amount of additional local configuration about\
    \ the\n   link and the remote ASBR is likely to be available.\n   We note further\
    \ that it is possible, and may be operationally\n   advantageous, to obtain some\
    \ of the required configuration\n   information from BGP.  Whether and how to\
    \ utilize these possibilities\n   is an implementation matter.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The protocol extensions defined in this document\
    \ are relatively minor\n   and can be secured within the AS in which they are\
    \ used by the\n   existing ISIS security mechanisms (e.g., using the cleartext\n\
    \   passwords or Hashed Message Authentication Codes - Message Digest 5\n   (HMAC-MD5)\
    \ algorithm, which are defined in [ISIS] and [RFC5304],\n   respectively).\n \
    \  There is no exchange of information between ASes, and no change to\n   the\
    \ ISIS security relationship between the ASes.  In particular,\n   since no ISIS\
    \ adjacency is formed on the inter-AS links, there is no\n   requirement for ISIS\
    \ security between the ASes.\n   Some of the information included in these new\
    \ advertisements (e.g.,\n   the remote AS number and the remote ASBR ID) is obtained\
    \ manually\n   from a neighboring administration as part of a commercial\n   relationship.\
    \  The source and content of this information should be\n   carefully checked\
    \ before it is entered as configuration information\n   at the ASBR responsible\
    \ for advertising the inter-AS TE links.\n   It is worth noting that in the scenario\
    \ we are considering, a Border\n   Gateway Protocol (BGP) peering may exist between\
    \ the two ASBRs and\n   that this could be used to detect inconsistencies in configuration\n\
    \   (e.g., the administration that originally supplied the information\n   may\
    \ be lying, or some manual mis-configurations or mistakes may be\n   made by the\
    \ operators).  For example, if a different remote AS number\n   is received in\
    \ a BGP OPEN [BGP] from that locally configured to\n   ISIS-TE, as we describe\
    \ here, then local policy SHOULD be applied to\n   determine whether to alert\
    \ the operator to a potential mis-\n   configuration or to suppress the ISIS advertisement\
    \ of the inter-AS\n   TE link.  Note further that if BGP is used to exchange TE\
    \ information\n   as described in Section 4.1, the inter-AS BGP session SHOULD\
    \ be\n   secured using mechanisms as described in [BGP] to provide\n   authentication\
    \ and integrity checks.\n   For a discussion of general security considerations\
    \ for IS-IS, see\n   [RFC5304].\n"
