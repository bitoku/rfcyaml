- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document discusses a flaw in some of the currently distributed\n\
    \   name resolver clients.  The flaw exposes a security weakness related\n   to\
    \ the search heuristic invoked by these same resolvers when users\n   provide\
    \ a partial domain name, and which is easy to exploit (although\n   not by the\
    \ masses).  This document points out the flaw, a case in\n   point, and a solution.\n"
- title: Background
  contents:
  - "Background\n   Current Domain Name Server clients are designed to ease the burden\
    \ of\n   remembering IP dotted quad addresses.  As such they translate human-\n\
    \   readable names into addresses and other resource records.  Part of\n   the\
    \ translation process includes understanding and dealing with\n   hostnames that\
    \ are not fully qualified domain names (FQDNs).\n   An absolute \"rooted\" FQDN\
    \ is of the format {name}{.} A non \"rooted\"\n   domain name is of the format\
    \ {name}\n   A domain name may have many parts and typically these include the\n\
    \   host, domain, and type.  Example:  foobar.company.com or\n   fooschool.university.edu.\n"
- title: Flaw
  contents:
  - "Flaw\n   The problem with most widely distributed resolvers based on the BSD\n\
    \   BIND resolver is that they attempt to resolve a partial name by\n   processing\
    \ a search list of partial domains to be added to portions\n   of the specified\
    \ host name until a DNS record is found.  This\n   \"feature\" is disabled by\
    \ default in the official BIND 4.9.2 release.\n   Example: A TELNET attempt by\
    \    User@Machine.Tech.ACES.COM\n                             to    UnivHost.University.EDU\n\
    \   The resolver client will realize that since \"UnivHost.University.EDU\"\n\
    \   does not end with a \".\", it is not an absolute \"rooted\" FQDN.  It\n  \
    \ will then try the following combinations until a resource record is\n   found:\n\
    \                UnivHost.University.EDU.Tech.ACES.COM.\n                UnivHost.University.EDU.ACES.COM.\n\
    \                UnivHost.University.EDU.COM.\n                UnivHost.University.EDU.\n"
- title: Security Issue
  contents:
  - "Security Issue\n   After registering the EDU.COM domain, it was discovered that\
    \ an\n   unliberal application of one wildcard CNAME record would cause *all*\n\
    \   connects from any .COM site to any .EDU site to terminate at one\n   target\
    \ machine in the private edu.com sub-domain.\n   Further, discussion reveals that\
    \ specific hostnames registered in\n   this private subdomain, or any similarly\
    \ named subdomain may be used\n   to spoof a host.\n        Example:        harvard.edu.com.\
    \        CNAME   targethost\n   Thus all connects to Harvard.edu from all .com\
    \ sites would end up at\n   targthost, a machine which could provide a Harvard.edu\
    \ login banner.\n   This is clearly unacceptable.  Further, it could only be made\
    \ worse\n   with domains like COM.EDU, MIL.GOV, GOV.COM, etc.\n"
- title: Public vs. Local Name Space Administration
  contents:
  - "Public vs. Local Name Space Administration\n   The specification of the Domain\
    \ Name System and the software that\n   implements it provides an undifferentiated\
    \ hierarchy which permits\n   delegation of administration for subordinate portions\
    \ of the name\n   space.  Actual administration of the name space is divided between\n\
    \   \"public\" and \"local\" portions.  Public administration pertains to all\n\
    \   top-level domains, such as .COM and .EDU.  For some domains, it also\n   pertains\
    \ to some number of sub-domain levels.  The multi-level nature\n   of the public\
    \ administration is most evident for top-level domains\n   for countries.  For\
    \ example in the Fully Qualified Domain Name,\n   dbc.mtview.ca.us., the portion\
    \ \"mtview.ca.us\" represents three levels\n   of public administration.  Only\
    \ the left-most portion is subject to\n   local administration.\n   The danger\
    \ of the heuristic search common in current practise is that\n   it it is possible\
    \ to \"intercept\" the search by matching against an\n   unintended value while\
    \ walking up the search list.  While this is\n   potentially dangerous at any\
    \ level, it is entirely unacceptable when\n   the error impacts users outside\
    \ of a local administration.\n   When attempting to resolve a partial domain name,\
    \ DNS resolvers use\n   the Domain Name of the searching host for deriving the\
    \ search list.\n   Existing DNS resolvers do not distinguish the portion of that\
    \ name\n   which is in the locally administered scope from the part that is\n\
    \   publically administered.\n"
- title: Solution(s)
  contents:
  - "Solution(s)\n   At a minimum, DNS resolvers must honor the BOUNDARY between local\
    \ and\n   public administration, by limiting any search lists to locally-\n  \
    \ administered portions of the Domain Name space.  This requires a\n   parameter\
    \ which shows the scope of the name space controlled by the\n   local administrator.\n\
    \   This would permit progressive searches from the most qualified to\n   less\
    \ qualified up through the locally controlled domain, but not\n   beyond.\n  \
    \ For example, if the local user were trying to reach:\n        User@chief.admin.DESERTU.EDU\
    \ from\n        starburst,astro.DESERTU.EDU,\n   it is reasonable to permit the\
    \ user to enter just chief.admin, and\n   for the search to cover:\n        chief.admin.astro.DESERTU.EDU\n\
    \        chief.admin.DESERTU.EDU\n   but not\n        chief.admin.EDU\n   In this\
    \ case, the value of \"search\" should be set to \"DESERTU.EDU\"\n   because that's\
    \ the scope of the name space controlled by the local\n   DNS administrator.\n\
    \   This is more than a mere optimization hack.  The local administrator\n   has\
    \ control over the assignment of names within the locally\n   administered domain,\
    \ so the administrator can make sure that\n   abbreviations result in the right\
    \ thing.  Outside of the local\n   control, users are necessarily at risk.\n \
    \  A more stringent mechanism is implemented in BIND 4.9.2, to respond\n   to\
    \ this problem:\n   The DNS Name resolver clients narrows its IMPLICIT search\
    \ list IF ANY\n   to only try the first and the last of the examples shown.\n\
    \   Any additional search alternatives must be configured into the\n   resolver\
    \ EXPLICITLY.\n   DNS Name resolver software SHOULD NOT use implicit search lists\
    \ in\n   attempts to resolve partial names into absolute FQDNs other than the\n\
    \   hosts's immediate parent domain.\n   Resolvers which continue to use implicit\
    \ search lists MUST limit\n   their scope to locally administered sub-domains.\n\
    \   DNS Name resolver software SHOULD NOT come pre-configured with\n   explicit\
    \ search lists that perpetuate this problem.\n   Further, in any event where a\
    \ \".\" exists in a specified name it\n   should be assumed to be a fully qualified\
    \ domain name (FQDN) and\n   SHOULD be tried as a rooted name first.\n   Example:\
    \  Given  user@a.b.c.d connecting to e.f.g.h  only two tries\n             should\
    \ be attempted as a result of using an implicit\n             search list:\n \
    \               e.f.g.h.  and e.f.g.h.b.c.d.\n             Given user@a.b.c.d.\
    \ connecting to host those same two\n             tries would appear as:\n   \
    \             x.b.c.d.  and x.\n   Some organizations make regular use of multi-part,\
    \ partially\n   qualified Domain Names.  For example, host foo.loc1.org.city.state.us\n\
    \   might be used to making references to bar.loc2, or mumble.loc3, all\n   of\
    \ which refer to whatever.locN.org.city.state.us\n   The stringent implicit search\
    \ rules for BIND 4.9.2 will now cause\n   these searches to fail.  To return the\
    \ ability for them to succeed,\n   configuration of the client resolvers must\
    \ be changed to include an\n   explicit search rule for org.city.state.us.  That\
    \ is, it must contain\n   an explicit rule for any -- and each -- portion of the\
    \ locally-\n   administered sub-domain that it wishes to have as part of the search\n\
    \   list.\n"
