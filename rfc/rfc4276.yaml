    \ specified in RFC 4271.  After a brief summary of the results, each\n   response\
    \ is listed.  This document contains responses from the four\n   implementers\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document reports results from a survey of implementations\
    \ of\n   BGP-4 as specified in [RFC4271].  RFC 4271 is in alignment with\n   current\
    \ deployments of BGP-4 and obsoletes the BGP standard\n   [RFC1771].  BGP is a\
    \ widely deployed cornerstone of Internet\n   technology that continues to add\
    \ additional functionality as the\n   needs of the Internet evolve.  As deployed\
    \ in the Internet, BGP-4\n   encompasses both this base specification and additional\n\
    \   specifications such as TCP MD5 [RFC2385], BGP Route Reflectors\n   [RFC2796],\
    \ BGP Confederations [RFC3065], and BGP Route Refresh\n   [RFC2918].\n   The BGP-4\
    \ implementation survey had 259 detailed questions about\n   compliance with [RFC4271].\
    \  Four implementers (Alcatel, Cisco,\n   Laurel, and NextHop) completed the survey.\
    \  Section 3 provides a\n   compilation of those results.\n   Section 2.1 highlights\
    \ significant differences and Section 2.2\n   provides an overview of the differences\
    \ between the four\n   implementations.  Section 2.3 provides interoperability\
    \ information.\n   Due to the large number of BGP implementations and the small\
    \ number\n   of respondents, the editors took an informal survey to determine\
    \ if\n   the length of the original survey caused implementers not to submit\n\
    \   it.  Three implementers responded, and all indicated the length of\n   the\
    \ survey was the issue.  Section 4 gives the results of this\n   informal survey.\n\
    \   In this document, the editors have compiled the results of the\n   implementation\
    \ survey results and the informal survey.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Results of Survey\n   The respondents replied \"Y\" (yes) or \"N\" (no) to\
    \ the survey's 259\n   questions to indicate whether their implementation supports\
    \ the\n   Functionality/Description of the [RFC2119] language in [RFC4271].\n\
    \   The respondents replied \"O\" (other) to indicate that the support is\n  \
    \ neither \"Y\" nor \"N\" (for example, an alternate behavior).\n"
- title: 2.1.  Significant Differences
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Significant Differences\n   Each question received affirmative responses\
    \ from at least two\n   implementers (i.e., two \"Y\" responses, or one \"Y\"\
    \ and one \"O\"),\n   except the following questions:\n   a) MUST - Linked Questions\
    \ 212/213, regarding Section 9.1.4\n      Due to the format of the linked questions,\
    \ three vendors (Cisco,\n      Laurel, and NextHop) replied \"N\" to Question\
    \ 213.  (See Section\n      2.2 for details.)\n   b) SHALL NOT - Question 228,\
    \ regarding Section 9.2.2.2\n      Three vendors (Alcatel, Cisco, and Laurel)\
    \ answered \"N\" to SHALL\n      NOT (meaning they did).  One vendor (NextHop)\
    \ indicated \"O\"\n      matching the specification.\n      Text:  Routes that\
    \ have different MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute SHALL\n             NOT be aggregated.\
    \  (Section 9.2.2.2, [RFC4271])\n   c) SHOULD - Questions 257 and 258, regarding\
    \ Appendix F\n      Three vendors answered \"N\" and one vendor answered \"Y\"\
    \ to Question\n      257.  All four vendors answered \"N\" to Question 258.  (Please\
    \ note\n      that support of Appendix F, \"Implementation Recommendations\",\
    \ is\n      optional.)\n      Text:  A BGP speaker which needs to withdraw a destination\
    \ and\n             send an update about a more specific or less specific route\n\
    \             SHOULD combine them into the same UPDATE message.\n            \
    \ (Appendix F.2, [RFC4271])\n      Text:  The last instance (rightmost occurrence)\
    \ of that AS number\n             is kept.  (Appendix F.6, [RFC4271])\n   d) MAY\
    \ - Questions 180 and 254, regarding Sections 8.1.2.4 and 10\n      Three vendors\
    \ answered \"N\", and 1 replied \"Y\" to Question 180.\n      Text:  The Event\
    \ numbers (1-28) utilized in this state machine\n             description aid\
    \ in specifying the behavior of the BGP state\n             machine.  Implementations\
    \ MAY use these numbers to provide\n             network management information.\
    \  The exact form of a FSM or\n             the FSM events are specific to each\
    \ implementation.\n             (Section 8.1.2.4, [RFC4271])\n      Editors' note:\
    \  Section 8.1.2.4 was written to allow existing\n                      implementations\
    \ to transition to the new event\n                      numbering.  It was expected\
    \ over time (3 years)\n                      that the FSM event numbering would\
    \ be updated to\n                      the new numbering.\n      Three vendors\
    \ answered \"N\" and one answered \"Y\" to Question 254\n      about configurable\
    \ jitter time values.\n      Text:  A given BGP speaker MAY apply the same jitter\
    \ to each of\n             these quantities regardless of the destinations to\
    \ which\n             the updates are being sent; that is, jitter need not be\n\
    \             configured on a \"per peer\" basis.  (Section 10, [RFC4271])\n \
    \     Question:  Is the jitter range configurable?\n"

    N\" and one answered \"Y\" to Question 213\n      about the aggregation of routes.\
    \  Questions 212 and 213 are\n      grouped together.\n      Question 212 states:\
    \ \"The decision process MUST either install\n         both routes or...\"\n \
    \     Question 213 states:  \"Aggregate the two routes and install the\n     \
    \    aggregated route, provided that both routes have the same value\n       \
    \  of the NEXT_HOP attribute\"\n      Of the four respondents that said \"Y\"\
    \ to Question 212, three said\n      \"N\" to Question 213.  Given the context\
