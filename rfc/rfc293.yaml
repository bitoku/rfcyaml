  - "                          NETWORK HOST STATUS\n     This RFC reports on the status\
    \ of most Network Hosts from January\n3 to January 15.\n     Several Hosts are\
    \ currently excluded from the daily testing.\nThese Hosts fall into two categories:\n\
    1) Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network as\nservers (available\
    \ for use from other sites) on a regular basis for at\nleast two weeks.  Included\
    \ here are:\n       Network\n       Address                Site            Computer\n\
    \         133                  BBN             PDP-10 (B)\n           8*     \
    \            SDC             IBM-370/155\n          13                  Case \

    2) Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.  Included here\nare the\
    \ Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network (AMES,\nMITRE, NBS and BBN**).\
    \  This category also includes the Network\nControl Center Computer (Network Address\
    \ 5) which is used solely for\ngathering statistics from the Network.  Finally,\
    \ included among these\nHosts are the following:\n       Network\n       Address\
    \                Site            Computer\n          7                  Rand \

    \     NBS             PDP-11\n     The tables on the next two pages summarize\
    \ the Host status for\nthis period.\n______________\nHost on the network, and\
    \ for this reason was not included in the daily\ntesting for the preceding two\
    \ weeks.\n**The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as\n\
    such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used to\nrefine and\
    \ debug the Terminal IMP programs.\n< In the original, the tables on this and\
    \ the following page were typed >\n< in \"landscape\" format.  For this online\
