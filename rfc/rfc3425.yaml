- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The IQUERY method of performing inverse DNS lookups, specified in\
    \ RFC\n   1035, has not been generally implemented and has usually been\n   operationally\
    \ disabled where it has been implemented.  Both reflect a\n   general view in\
    \ the community that the concept was unwise and that\n   the widely-used alternate\
    \ approach of using pointer (PTR) queries and\n   reverse-mapping records is preferable.\
    \  Consequently, this document\n   deprecates the IQUERY operation, declaring\
    \ it entirely obsolete.\n   This document updates RFC 1035.\n"
- title: 1 - Introduction
  contents:
  - "1 - Introduction\n   As specified in RFC 1035 (section 6.4), the IQUERY operation\
    \ for DNS\n   queries is used to look up the name(s) which are associated with\
    \ the\n   given value.  The value being sought is provided in the query's\n  \
    \ answer section and the response fills in the question section with\n   one or\
    \ more 3-tuples of type, name and class.\n   As noted in [RFC1035], section 6.4.3,\
    \ inverse query processing can\n   put quite an arduous burden on a server.  A\
    \ server would need to\n   perform either an exhaustive search of its database\
    \ or maintain a\n   separate database that is keyed by the values of the primary\n\
    \   database.  Both of these approaches could strain system resource use,\n  \
    \ particularly for servers that are authoritative for millions of\n   names.\n\
    \   Response packets from these megaservers could be exceptionally large,\n  \
    \ and easily run into megabyte sizes.  For example, using IQUERY to\n   find every\
    \ domain that is delegated to one of the nameservers of a\n   large ISP could\
    \ return tens of thousands of 3-tuples in the question\n   section.  This could\
    \ easily be used to launch denial of service\n   attacks.\n   Operators of servers\
    \ that do support IQUERY in some form (such as\n   very old BIND 4 servers) generally\
    \ opt to disable it.  This is\n   largely due to bugs in insufficiently-exercised\
    \ code, or concerns\n   about exposure of large blocks of names in their zones\
    \ by probes such\n   as inverse MX queries.\n   IQUERY is also somewhat inherently\
    \ crippled by being unable to tell a\n   requester where it needs to go to get\
    \ the information that was\n   requested.  The answer is very specific to the\
    \ single server that was\n   queried.  This is sometimes a handy diagnostic tool,\
    \ but apparently\n   not enough so that server operators like to enable it, or\
    \ request\n   implementation where it is lacking.\n   No known clients use IQUERY\
    \ to provide any meaningful service.  The\n   only common reverse mapping support\
    \ on the Internet, mapping address\n   records to names, is provided through the\
    \ use of pointer (PTR)\n   records in the in-addr.arpa tree and has served the\
    \ community well\n   for many years.\n   Based on all of these factors, this document\
    \ recommends that the\n   IQUERY operation for DNS servers be officially obsoleted.\n"
- title: 2 - Requirements
  contents:
  - "2 - Requirements\n   The key word \"SHOULD\" in this document is to be interpreted\
    \ as\n   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119, namely that there may exist valid\n  \
    \ reasons to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must\n   be understood\
    \ and carefully weighed before choosing a different\n   course.\n"
- title: 3 - Effect on RFC 1035
  contents:
  - "3 - Effect on RFC 1035\n   The effect of this document is to change the definition\
    \ of opcode 1\n   from that originally defined in section 4.1.1 of RFC 1035, and\
    \ to\n   entirely supersede section 6.4 (including subsections) of RFC 1035.\n\
    \   The definition of opcode 1 is hereby changed to:\n      \"1              \
    \ an inverse query (IQUERY) (obsolete)\"\n   The text in section 6.4 of RFC 1035\
    \ is now considered obsolete.  The\n   following is an applicability statement\
    \ regarding the IQUERY opcode:\n   Inverse queries using the IQUERY opcode were\
    \ originally described as\n   the ability to look up the names that are associated\
    \ with a\n   particular Resource Record (RR).  Their implementation was optional\n\
    \   and never achieved widespread use.  Therefore IQUERY is now obsolete,\n  \
    \ and name servers SHOULD return a \"Not Implemented\" error when an\n   IQUERY\
    \ request is received.\n"
- title: 4 - Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4 - Security Considerations\n   Since this document obsoletes an operation that\
    \ was once available,\n   it is conceivable that someone was using it as the basis\
    \ of a\n   security policy.  However, since the most logical course for such a\n\
    \   policy to take in the face of a lack of positive response from a\n   server\
    \ is to deny authentication/authorization, it is highly unlikely\n   that removing\
    \ support for IQUERY will open any new security holes.\n   Note that if IQUERY\
    \ is not obsoleted, securing the responses with DNS\n   Security (DNSSEC) is extremely\
    \ difficult without out-on-the-fly\n   digital signing.\n"
- title: 5 - IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5 - IANA Considerations\n   The IQUERY opcode of 1 should be permanently retired,\
    \ not to be\n   assigned to any future opcode.\n"
