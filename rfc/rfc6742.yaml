  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is part of the ILNP document set, which has\
    \ had\n   extensive review within the IRTF Routing RG.  ILNP is one of the\n \
    \  recommendations made by the RG Chairs.  Separately, various refereed\n   research\
    \ papers on ILNP have also been published during this decade.\n   So, the ideas\
    \ contained herein have had much broader review than the\n   IRTF Routing RG.\
    \  The views in this document were considered\n   controversial by the Routing\
    \ RG, but the RG reached a consensus that\n   the document still should be published.\
    \  The Routing RG has had\n   remarkably little consensus on anything, so virtually\
    \ all Routing RG\n   outputs are considered controversial.\n   At present, the\
    \ Internet research and development community is\n   exploring various approaches\
    \ to evolving the Internet Architecture to\n   solve a variety of issues including,\
    \ but not limited to, scalability\n   of inter-domain routing [RFC4984].  A wide\
    \ range of other issues\n   (e.g., site multihoming, node multihoming, site/subnet\
    \ mobility, node\n   mobility) are also active concerns at present.  Several different\n\
    \   classes of evolution are being considered by the Internet research\n   and\
    \ development community.  One class is often called \"Map and\n   Encapsulate\"\
    , where traffic would be mapped and then tunnelled\n   through the inter-domain\
    \ core of the Internet.  Another class being\n   considered is sometimes known\
    \ as \"Identifier/Locator Split\".  This\n   document relates to a proposal that\
    \ is in the latter class of\n   evolutionary approaches.\n   The Identifier-Locator\
    \ Network Protocol (ILNP) was developed to\n   explore a possible evolutionary\
    \ direction for the Internet\n   Architecture.  A description of the ILNP architecture\
    \ is available in\n   a separate document [RFC6740].  Implementation and engineering\n\
    \   details are largely isolated into a second document [RFC6741].\n   The Domain\
    \ Name System (DNS) is the standard way that Internet nodes\n   locate information\
    \ about addresses, mail exchangers, and other data\n   relating to remote Internet\
    \ nodes [RFC1034] [RFC1035].\n   More recently, the IETF has defined standards-track\
    \ security\n   extensions to the DNS [RFC4033].  These security extensions can\
    \ be\n   used to authenticate signed DNS data records and can be used to store\n\
    \   signed public keys in the DNS.  Further, the IETF has defined a\n   standards-track\
    \ approach to enable secure dynamic update of DNS\n   records over the network\
    \ [RFC3007].\n   This document defines several new optional data resource records.\n\
    \   This note specifies the syntax and other items required for\n   independent\
    \ implementations of these DNS resource records.  The\n   reader is assumed to\
    \ be familiar with the basics of DNS, including\n   familiarity with [RFC1034]\
    \ [RFC1035].\n   The concept of using DNS for rendezvous with mobile nodes or\
    \ mobile\n   networks has been proposed earlier, more than once, independently,\
    \ by\n   several other researchers; for example, please see [SB00], [SBK01],\n\
    \   and [PHG02].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Document Roadmap
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Document Roadmap\n   This document describes defines additional DNS resource\
    \ records that\n   support ILNP.\n   The ILNP architecture can have more than\
    \ one engineering\n   instantiation.  For example, one can imagine a \"clean-slate\"\
    \n   engineering design based on the ILNP architecture.  In separate\n   documents,\
    \ we describe two specific engineering instances of ILNP.\n   The term \"ILNPv6\"\
    \ refers precisely to an instance of ILNP that is\n   based upon, and backwards\
    \ compatible with, IPv6.  The term \"ILNPv4\"\n   refers precisely to an instance\
    \ of ILNP that is based upon, and\n   backwards compatible with, IPv4.\n   Many\
    \ engineering aspects common to both ILNPv4 and ILNPv6 are\n   described in [RFC6741].\
    \  A full engineering specification for either\n   ILNPv6 or ILNPv4 is beyond\
    \ the scope of this document.\n   Readers are referred to other related ILNP documents\
    \ for details not\n   described here:\n   a) [RFC6740] is the main architectural\
    \ description of ILNP, including\n      the concept of operations.\n   b) [RFC6741]\
    \ describes engineering and implementation considerations\n      that are common\
    \ to both ILNPv4 and ILNPv6.\n   c) [RFC6743] defines a new ICMPv6 Locator Update\
    \ message used by an\n      ILNP node to inform its correspondent nodes of any\
    \ changes to its\n      set of valid Locators.\n   d) [RFC6744] defines a new\
    \ IPv6 Nonce Destination Option used by\n      ILNPv6 nodes (1) to indicate to\
    \ ILNP correspondent nodes (by\n      inclusion within the initial packets of\
    \ an ILNP session) that the\n      node is operating in the ILNP mode and (2)\
    \ to prevent off-path\n      attacks against ILNP ICMP messages.  This Nonce is\
    \ used, for\n      example, with all ILNP ICMPv6 Locator Update messages that\
    \ are\n      exchanged among ILNP correspondent nodes.\n   e) [RFC6745] defines\
    \ a new ICMPv4 Locator Update message used by an\n      ILNP node to inform its\
    \ correspondent nodes of any changes to its\n      set of valid Locators.\n  \
    \ f) [RFC6746] defines a new IPv4 Nonce Option used by ILNPv4 nodes to\n     \
    \ carry a security nonce to prevent off-path attacks against ILNP\n      ICMP\
    \ messages and also defines a new IPv4 Identifier Option used\n      by ILNPv4\
    \ nodes.\n   g) [RFC6747] describes extensions to Address Resolution Protocol\n\
    \      (ARP) for use with ILNPv4.\n   h) [RFC6748] describes optional engineering\
    \ and deployment functions\n      for ILNP.  These are not required for the operation\
    \ or use of ILNP\n      and are provided as additional options.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Terminology\n   In this document, the term \"ILNP-aware\" applied to a\
    \ DNS component\n   (either authoritative server or cache) is used to indicate\
    \ that the\n   component attempts to include other ILNP RRTypes to the Additional\n\
    \   section of a DNS response to increase performance and reduce the\n   number\
    \ of follow-up queries for other ILNP RRTypes.  These other\n   RRsets MAY be\
    \ added to the Additional section if space permits and\n   only when the QTYPE\
    \ equals NID, L64, L32, or LP.  There is no method\n   for a server to signal\
    \ that it is ILNP-aware.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  New Resource Records
  contents:
  - "2.  New Resource Records\n   This document specifies several new and closely\
    \ related DNS data\n   resource records (RRs).  These new RR types have the mnemonics\
    \ \"NID\",\n   \"L32\", \"L64\", and \"LP\".  These RR types are associated with\
    \ a Fully\n   Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) that is hereafter called the \"owner\n\
    \   name\".  These are part of work on the Identifier-Locator Network\n   Protocol\
    \ (ILNP) [RFC6740].\n   For clarity, throughout this section of this document,\
    \ the \"RDATA\"\n   subsections specify the on-the-wire format for these records,\
    \ while\n   the \"Presentation Format\" subsections specify the human-readable\n\
    \   format used in a DNS configuration file (i.e., \"master file\" as\n   defined\
    \ by RFC 1035, Section 5.1).\n"

    \ (RR) is used hold\n   values for Node Identifiers that will be used for ILNP-capable\
    \ nodes.\n   NID records are present only for ILNP-capable nodes.  This\n   restriction\
    \ is important; ILNP-capable nodes use the presence of NID\n   records in the\
    \ DNS to learn that a correspondent node is also ILNP-\n   capable.  While erroneous\
    \ NID records in the DNS for a node that is\n   not ILNP-capable would not prevent\
    \ communication, such erroneous DNS\n   records could increase the delay at the\
    \ start of an IP session.\n   A given owner name may have zero or more NID records\
    \ at a given time.\n   In normal operation, nodes that support the Identifier-Locator\n\
    \   Network Protocol (ILNP) will have at least one valid NID record.\n   The type\
    \ value for the NID RR type is 104.\n   The NID RR is class independent.\n   The\

    \   Unlike IPv6 interface identifiers, which are bound to a specific\n   *interface*\

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Use of ILNP Records\n   As these DNS records are only used with the Identifier-Locator\n\
    \   Network Protocol (ILNP), these records MUST NOT be present for a node\n  \
    \ that does not support ILNP.  This lookup process is considered to be\n   in\
    \ the \"forward\" direction.\n   The Preference fields associated with the NID,\
    \ L32, L64, and LP\n   records are used to indicate the owner name's preference\
    \ for others\n   to use one particular NID, L32, L64, or LP record, rather than\
    \ use\n   another NID, L32, L64, or LP record also associated with that owner\n\
    \   name.  Lower Preference field values are preferred over higher\n   Preference\
    \ field values.\n   It is possible that a DNS stub resolver querying for one of\
    \ these\n   record types will not receive all NID, L32, L64, and LP RR's in a\n\
    \   single response.  Credible anecdotal reports indicate at least one\n   DNS\
    \ recursive cache implementation actively drops all Additional Data\n   records\
    \ that were not expected by that DNS recursive cache.  So even\n   if the authoritative\
    \ DNS server includes all the relevant records in\n   the Additional Data section\
    \ of the DNS response, the querying DNS\n   stub resolver might not receive all\
    \ of those Additional Data records.\n   DNS resolvers also might purge some ILNP\
    \ RRsets before others, for\n   example, if NID RRsets have a longer DNS TTL value\
    \ than Locator-\n   related (e.g., LP, L32, L64) RRsets.  So a DNS stub resolver\
    \ sending\n   queries to a DNS resolver cannot be certain if they have obtained\
    \ all\n   available RRtypes for a given owner name.  Therefore, the DNS stub\n\
    \   resolver SHOULD send follow-up DNS queries for RRTYPE values that\n   were\
    \ missing and are desired, to ensure that the DNS stub resolver\n   receives all\
    \ the necessary information.\n   Note nodes likely either to be mobile or to be\
    \ multihomed normally\n   will have very low DNS TTL values for L32 and L64 records,\
    \ as those\n   values might change frequently.  However, the DNS TTL values for\
    \ NID\n   and LP records normally will be higher, as those values are not\n  \
    \ normally impacted by node location changes.  Previous trace-driven\n   DNS simulations\
    \ from MIT [JSBM02] and more recent experimental\n   validation of operational\
    \ DNS from U. of St Andrews [BA11] both\n   indicate deployment and use of very\
    \ short DNS TTL values within\n   'stub' or 'leaf' DNS domains is not problematic.\n\
    \   An ILNP node MAY use any NID value associated with its DNS owner name\n  \
    \ with any or all Locator (L32 or L64) values also associated with its\n   DNS\
    \ owner name.\n   Existing DNS servers that do not explicitly support the new\

    \ DNS query for an NID\n   owner name, such as host1.example.com, would benefit\
    \ from receiving\n   all ILNP DNS records related to that owner name being returned,\

    \ initiate an ILNP session.\n   However, this is not always the case: a DNS query\
    \ for L64 for a\n   particular owner name might be made because the DNS TTL for\
