Abstract The Session Description Protocol (SDP) has an attribute that allows RTP applications to specify an address and a port associated with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) traffic.
In RTP based source specific multicast (SSM) sessions, the same attribute is used to designate the address and the RTCP port of the Feedback Target in the SDP description.
However, the RTCP port associated with the SSM session itself cannot be specified by the same attribute to avoid ambiguity, and thus, is required to be derived from the "m " line of the media description.
Deriving the RTCP port from the "m " line imposes an unnecessary restriction.
This document removes this restriction by introducing a new SDP attribute.
The Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] has an attribute that allows RTP applications [RFC3550] to specify an address and a port associated with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) traffic [RFC3605].
This attribute is called 'rtcp'.
Now consider a network where one or more media senders send RTP packets to a distribution source, which then multicasts these RTP packets to multicast receivers using a source specific multicast (SSM) arrangement [RFC5760].
The distribution source also multicasts the forward RTCP traffic (i.e., RTCP sender reports and receiver reports or their summaries) to the receivers in the same SSM session.
In RTP based SSM sessions, the 'rtcp' attribute is used to designate the address and the RTCP port of the Feedback Target in the SDP description [RFC5760].
However, the RTCP port associated with the SSM session itself cannot be specified by the same attribute since it could potentially cause ambiguity.
Thus, the multicast RTCP port is required to be derived from the "m " line of the media description (see Section 10.2 of [RFC5760]) by following the  1 rule (see Section 11 of [RFC3550]).
However, [RFC3550] lifted the requirement for the  1 rule since it imposed an unnecessary restriction on RTCP port selection.
In this specification, we introduce a new SDP attribute to remove this restriction.
The new attribute allows the multicast sender to use its desired port in the RTCP session.
The 'multicast rtcp' Attribute In RTP based SSM sessions, the distribution source can use different multicast RTP and RTCP ports to send the RTP and RTCP packets, respectively.
Alternatively, the distribution source can use RTP/ RTCP port muxing [RFC5761], in which case the RTP and RTCP packets are sent to the same destination port in the SSM session.
For the cases when the distribution source does not want to use the one higher port for the RTCP traffic, this document defines a new SDP attribute, called 'multicast rtcp'.
By using this attribute, the distribution source uses a desired port for the SSM RTCP session.
In the absence of the 'multicast rtcp' attribute, the  1 rule applies following [RFC5760].
The following ABNF [RFC5234] syntax formally describes the 'multicast rtcp' attribute: rtcp attribute
"a multicast rtcp:" port CRLF Figure 1:
ABNF syntax for the 'multicast rtcp' attribute Here, the 'port' token is defined as specified in Section 9 of [RFC4566].
The 'multicast rtcp' attribute is defined as both a media level and session level attribute.
Except where stated otherwise in this document, the rules of [RFC3550] apply.
In the session description shown in Figure 2, a source stream is multicast from a distribution source (with a source IP address of 198.51.100.1) to the multicast destination address of 233.252.0.2 and port 41000.
The forward RTCP traffic is multicast in the same multicast group but to port 42000 as specified by the "a multicast  rtcp:42000" line.
A feedback target with an address of 192.0.2.1 and port of 43000 is specified by the 'rtcp' attribute.

Example SDP showing the use of the 'multicast rtcp' attribute 4.
The 'multicast rtcp' attribute is not believed to introduce any significant security risk to multimedia applications.
A malevolent third party could use this attribute to redirect the RTCP traffic, but this requires intercepting and rewriting the packets carrying the SDP description; and if an interceptor can do that, many more attacks are possible, including a wholesale change of the addresses and port numbers at which the media will be sent.
In order to avoid attacks of this sort, the SDP description needs to be integrity protected and provided with source authentication.
This can, for example, be achieved on an end to end basis using S/MIME [RFC5652]
[RFC5751] when SDP is used in a signaling packet using MIME types (application/sdp).
Alternatively, HTTPS [RFC2818] or the authentication method in the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP)
[RFC2974] could be used as well.
