- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   People often refer to things in the real world by a common\
    \ name or\n   phrase, e.g., a trade name, company name, or a book title.  These\n\
    \   names are sometimes easier for people to remember and enter than\n   URLs;\
    \ many people consider URLs hard to remember or type.\n   Furthermore, because\
    \ of the limited syntax of URLs, companies and\n   individuals are finding that\
    \ the ones that might be most reasonable\n   for their resources are already being\
    \ used elsewhere and therefore\n   unavailable.  Common names are not URIs (Uniform\
    \ Resource\n   Identifiers) in that they lack the syntactic structure imposed\
    \ by\n   URIs; furthermore, unlike URNs, there is no requirement of uniqueness\n\
    \   or persistence of the association between a common name and a\n   resource.\
    \  These common names are expected to be used primarily by\n   humans (as opposed\
    \ to machine agents).\n   Common name \"resolution\" is a process of mapping from\
    \ common names to\n   Internet resources; a Common Name Resolution Protocol (CNRP)\
    \ is a\n   network protocol used in such a process.\n   A useful analogy for understanding\
    \ the purpose and scope of common\n   names, and CNRP, are everyday (human language)\
    \ dictionaries.  These\n   cover a given language (namespace) -- perhaps a spoken\
    \ language, or\n   some specific subset (e.g., technical terms, etc).  Some dictionaries\n\
    \   give definitions, others give translations (e.g., to other\n   languages).\
    \  Different entities publish dictionaries that cover the\n   same language --\
    \ e.g., Larousse and Collins can both publish French-\n   language dictionaries.\
    \  Thus, the dictionary publisher is the analog\n   to the resolution service\
    \ provider -- the service can provide a\n   value-add and build up name recognition\
    \ for itself, but does not\n   impede other entities from providing definitions\
    \ for precisely the\n   same strings in the language.\n   Services are arising\
    \ that offer a mapping from common names to\n   Internet resources (e.g., as identified\
    \ by a URI).  These services\n   often resolve common name categories such as\
    \ company names, trade\n   names, or common keywords.  Thus, such a resolution\
    \ service may\n   operate in one or a small number of categories or domains, or\
    \ may\n   expect the client to limit the resolution scope to a limited number\n\
    \   of categories or domains.  For example, the phrase \"Internet\n   Engineering\
    \ Task Force\" is a common name in the \"organization\"\n   category, as is \"\
    Moby Dick\" in the book category.  A single common\n   name may be associated\
    \ with different data records, and more than one\n   resolution service is expected\
    \ to exist.  Any common name may be used\n   in any resolution service.\n   Two\
    \ classes of clients of such services are being built: browser\n   improvements\
    \ and web accessible front-end services. Browser\n   enhancements modify the \"\
    open\" or \"address\" field of a browser so\n   that a common name can be entered\
    \ instead of a URL.  Internet search\n   sites integrate common name resolution\
    \ services as a complement to\n   search. In both cases, these may be clients\
    \ of back-end resolution\n   services.  In the browser case, the browser must\
    \ talk to a service\n   that will resolve the common name. The search sites are\
    \ accessed via\n   a browser.  In some cases, the search site may also be the\
    \ back-end\n   resolution service, but in others, the search site is a front-end\
    \ to\n   a collection of back-end services.\n   This effort is about the creation\
    \ of a protocol for client\n   applications to communicate with common name resolution\
    \ services, as\n   exemplified in both the browser enhancement and search site\n\
    \   paradigms.  Although the protocol's primary function is resolution,\n   it\
    \ is intended to address the issues of internationalization,\n   authentication\
    \ and privacy as well.  Name resolution services are not\n   generic search services\
    \ and thus do not need to provide complex\n   Boolean query, relevance ranking\
    \ or similar capabilities.  The\n   protocol is expected to be a simple, minimal\
    \ interoperable core.\n   Mechanisms for extension will be provided, so that additional\n\
    \   capabilities can be added later.\n   Several other issues, while of importance\
    \ to the deployment of common\n   name resolution services, are outside of the\
    \ resolution protocol\n   itself and are not in the initial scope of the proposed\
    \ effort.\n   These include discovery and selection of resolution service\n  \
    \ providers, administration of resolution services, name registration,\n   name\
    \ ownership, and methods for creating, identifying or insuring\n   unique common\
    \ names.\n"
- title: 2. Key Goals for a Common Name Resolution Protocol
  contents:
  - "2. Key Goals for a Common Name Resolution Protocol\n   The key deliverable is\
    \ a protocol for parameterized resolution.\n   \"Resolution\" is defined as the\
    \ retrieval of data associated (a\n   priori) with descriptors that match the\
    \ input request.\n   \"Parameterized\" means the ability to have a multi-component\n\
    \   descriptor both as part of the query and the response.  These\n   descriptors\
    \ are attribute-value pairs.  They are not required to\n   provide unique identification,\
    \ therefore 0 or more records may be\n   returned to meet a specific input query.\
    \  The protocol will define:\n      - client requests/server responses to identify\
    \ the specific\n        parameters accepted and/or required on input requests\n\
    \      - client request/server responses to identify properties to be\n      \
    \  returned in the result set\n      - expression of parameterized input query\n\
    \      - expression of result sets\n      - standard expression of error conditions\n\
    \   To avoid creating a general search protocol with unbounded\n   complexity,\
    \ and to keep the protocol simple enough so that different\n   implementations\
    \ will have similar behavior, the resolution protocol\n   should be limited to\
    \ sub-string matches against parameter values.  To\n   support full internationalization,\
    \ UTF-8 encoding of strings and\n   sub-strings is preferred.\n   In addition,\
    \ the working group should define one sample service based\n   on this protocol\
    \ -- the resolution of so-called \"common names\", or\n   resolution of non-unique,\
    \ registered strings to resource\n   descriptions.\n"
- title: 3. CNRP goals
  contents:
  - "3. CNRP goals\n   The goal of CNRP is to create a lightweight search protocol\
    \ with a\n   simple query interface, with a focus on making the common case of\n\
    \   substring search with a single result most efficient.  In addition,\n   efficient\
    \ support for keyed value search is important.  Each key is a\n   named meta property\
    \ of the resource (e.g. category, language,\n   geographical region.).  Some of\
    \ these properties could be\n   standardized (e.g. the common name property).\
    \  The goal is to support\n   partial specification of query parameters and even\
    \ partial and fuzzy\n   matches on names.  CNRP is intended to be simpler than\
    \ LDAP for\n   simple applications.\n   Besides simplicity, the CNRP protocol\
    \ should be consistent with\n   efficient implementation of a simple and intuitive\
    \ user interface.\n   The emphasis on the common name as the common denominator\
    \ to find a\n   wide range of resources reduces the UI to its minimal expression\
    \ (the\n   user types a few words in a text box and presses enter).\n   CNRP should\
    \ provide interoperability with multiple common name\n   databases (section 4\
    \ presents many examples of such databases).  The\n   query interface should be\
    \ extensible and customizable to the specific\n   needs of a specific type of\
    \ resolution service.  However, the need\n   for interoperability across databases\
    \ and resolution services\n   combined with the need to ensure the scalability\
    \ of search (across\n   millions of names from multiple providers) have lead this\
    \ group to\n   consider the explicit requirement of supporting categories in CNRP.\n\
    \   This requirement is discussed further in section 5.\n"
- title: 4. Example of common name namespaces
  contents:
  - "4. Example of common name namespaces\n   Commercial companies have already developed\
    \ and deployed common name\n   resolution services such as RealNames (http://www.realnames.com)\
    \ and\n   NetWords (http://www.netword.com).  These commercial implementations\n\
    \   are mainly focused on trade names, such as company names, brands and\n   trademarks.\
    \  These services constitute a concrete example of common\n   name namespaces\
    \ implementation and are useful to understand the scope\n   of the CNRP effort.\n\
    \   CNRP is also directly targeted at directory service providers. CNRP\n   is\
    \ relevant to these services to increase their reach through\n   integration into\
    \ larger Web sites such as the search portals.  For\n   example, IAtlas has developed\
    \ a directory service for businesses that\n   it distributes through its Web site\
    \ and Inktomi.  IAtlas could\n   immediately leverage CNRP to distribute their\
    \ service through their\n   external distribution partners.\n   Directory services\
    \ must not be confused with search engines.\n   Directory services use highly\
    \ structured information to identify a\n   resource.  This information is external\
    \ to the actual resource and is\n   called metadata.  In contrast, search engines\
    \ mainly rely on the\n   content of the resource (e.g. the text of a Web page).\n\
    \   CNRP plays well with directory services that present a critical piece\n  \
    \ of information about the resource in the form of a textual\n   identifier, a\
    \ title or a terse description (the common name).\n   Numerous examples come instantly\
    \ to mind: company names, book titles,\n   people names, songs, ISBNs, and social\
    \ security numbers.  In all\n   cases, the common name is the natural property\
    \ for users to lookup\n   the resource.  The common name is always simple and\
    \ intuitive: it has\n   no syntax, it is multilingual, memorable and can often\
    \ be guessed.\n   The following list is intended to put in prospective the wide\
    \ range\n   of applications for CNRP:\n   - Business directories (SEC, NASDAQ,\
    \ E*Trade, .).  The resource is\n     company information (address, products,\
    \ SEC filings, stock quotes,\n     etc.).  The common name is the company name.\n\
    \   - White pages (BigFoot, WhoWhere, Switchboard, ...): The resource a\n    \
    \ person (current address, telephone numbers, email addresses,\n     employer,\
    \ ...).  The common name is a last name, a telephone number\n     or an email\
    \ address.\n   - E-commerce directories: The resource is a product for sale (car,\n\
    \     house, furniture, actually almost any type of consumption item).\n     The\
    \ common name is a brand name or a description.\n   - Publishing directories:\
    \ The resource is one of many things: a book,\n     a poem, a CD, an MP3 download.\
    \  The common name is an ISBN, a song\n     title, an artist's name. The common\
    \ name is typically the title of\n     a publication.\n   - Entertainment directories:\
    \ The resource is an event (a movie, a\n     concert, a TV show).  The common\
    \ name is the name or a description\n     for the event, the movie title, a rock\
    \ band name, a show.\n   - Yellow pages services: Here again, the resource can\
    \ be very\n     diverse: a house for sale, a restaurant, a car dealership or other\n\
    \     type of establishment or service that can be found in the\n     traditional\
    \ yellow pages.  The common name can be a street address,\n     the name of a\
    \ business, or a description.\n   - News feeds: The resource is a press article.\
    \ The common name is the\n     headline.\n   - Vertical directories: the DNS TLD\
    \ categories, the ISO country\n     codes.\n"
- title: 5. Private and public namespaces
  contents:
  - "5. Private and public namespaces\n   A set of common names within a category\
    \ (books, news, businesses,\n   etc.)  is called a common name \"namespace\".\
    \ The term \"namespace\" only\n   refers to the set of names.  It does not encompass\
    \ the bindings or\n   associations between a name and data about the name (such\
    \ as a\n   resource, identified by a URI).  Such bindings might be created and\n\
    \   maintained by a common name resolution services. Resolution services\n   may\
    \ create binding that are relevant for the type of service that\n   they offer.\n\
    \   It is useful to distinguish between \"private\" and \"public\"\n   namespaces.\
    \  A namespace is private if owned by an authority that\n   controls the right\
    \ to assign the names.  A namespace is private even\n   if the right to assign\
    \ those names is held by a neutral party.\n   A namespace is public when not controlled\
    \ by any single authority or\n   resolution provider.  Assignment of the names\
    \ is distributed.\n   However, it is reasonable to expect that people who assign\
    \ names will\n   tend to pick names that have a minimum of collisions.  For some\
    \ of\n   these namespaces, there will even be mechanisms to discourage\n   duplicate\
    \ assignment, but all of them are inherently ambiguous.\n   Public namespaces\
    \ are not controlled. Examples of public namespaces\n   are:\n   - Titles of books,\
    \ movies, songs, poems, short stories, plays, or\n     compilations\n   - Place\
    \ names\n   - Street names\n   - People's names\n   Because these namespaces are\
    \ unbounded and open to any types of name\n   assignment, they will have scalability\
    \ problems.  To support these\n   namespaces, CNRP must provide at least one standard\
    \ mechanism to\n   filter a large list of related results.  A filtering mechanism\
    \ must\n   allow the user to narrow the search further down to a smaller result\n\
    \   set, because the common name alone may not be enough.\n   One possible search\
    \ filter is related to the notion of categories.\n   Because categories create\
    \ a structure to organize named resources,\n   large resolution services are likely\
    \ to support some sort of\n   categorization system (whether flat or hierarchical).\
    \  Although\n   categories constitute an efficient search filter, defining standard\n\
    \   vocabularies for common name categories is beyond the scope of the\n   protocol\
    \ design.  The protocol design for CNRP should not require a\n   standardized\
    \ taxonomy for categories in order to be effective.  For\n   example, CNRP resolution\
    \ could use free-form keywords; the end-user\n   would use these keywords as part\
    \ of the query.  Each service would\n   then be responsible for mapping the keywords\
    \ to zero, one or many\n   categories in their own classification.  The keywords\
    \ would remain\n   classification independent and different services could use\
    \ different\n   categorization schemes without compromising interoperability.\
    \  It\n   would then be up to the service to provide its own mapping.  For\n \
    \  example, let us assume that one namespace is resolving names under\n   the\
    \ category: \"Hobby & Interests > collecting > antique > books\".\n   Assume that\
    \ a second namespace has decided to organize the names of\n   similar resources\
    \ under the classification: \"Arts > Humanities >\n   Literature > History of\
    \ Books and Printing > antiques\".  Although the\n   two taxonomies are different,\
    \ a CNRP query specifying\n   category_keywords = \"antique books\" would allow\
    \ each service to\n   identify the appropriate category.  This mechanism may ensure\
    \ that\n   the two result lists are small and coherent enough to be merged into\n\
    \   one unique result set.  It is important to note that this approach\n   would\
    \ work whether the classification is hierarchical or not.\n   Although this suggestion\
    \ has merit, it is fair to say that it remains\n   unproven.  In particular, it\
    \ is unclear that the category_keywords\n   property would guarantee full interoperability\
    \ across resolution\n   services.  In any case, free form keywords for specifying\
    \ categories\n   is just one of several possible ways of limiting the scope of\
    \ a\n   query.  Although the specific mechanisms are not agreed upon a this\n\
    \   time, CNRP will provide at least one standard mechanism for limiting\n   scope.\n"
- title: 6. Distributors/integrators of common name resolution services
  contents:
  - "6. Distributors/integrators of common name resolution services\n   We anticipate\
    \ two main categories of distributors for common\n   namespaces.  The first category\
    \ is made of the Web portals such as\n   search engines (Yahoo, MSN, Lycos, Infoseek,\
    \ AltaVista, ...).  A\n   common name resolution service will typically address\
    \ only one very\n   specialized aspect of search (company names or book titles\
    \ or people\n   names, ..).  This type of focused lookup service is a useful\n\
    \   complement to generic search.  Hence, portals are likely to integrate\n  \
    \ several types of common name services.  CNRP solves the difficult\n   problem\
    \ of integrating multiple external independent services within\n   one Web site.\
    \  Today, the lack of standardization in performance\n   requirements and query\
    \ interface leads to loose integration (co-\n   branded pages hosted on virtual\
    \ domains) or maintenance problems\n   (periodical data dumps).  CNRP is aimed\
    \ at solving some of these\n   issues. CNRP facilitates the deployment of embedded\
    \ services by\n   creating a common interface to all common name services.\n \
    \  The second category of distributors is made of the Web browser\n   companies.\
    \ Netscape's smart browsing\n   (http://home.netscape.com/communicator/v4.5/index.html#smart)\
    \ and\n   Microsoft's IE5 auto-search features\n   (http://www.microsoft.com/windows/Ie/Features/AutoSearch/default.asp)\n\
    \   demonstrate that the two dominant Web browser companies understand\n   the\
    \ value of navigation and search from the command line of the\n   browser.  It\
    \ is very clear how this command line could be used as the\n   main user interface\
    \ to common name resolution services through CNRP.\n   In many ways, it is actually\
    \ the most natural user interface to\n   resolve a common name.  For this strategic\
    \ component of the browser's\n   user interface to remain truly open to all common\
    \ name resolution\n   services, it is key that there exists a standard resolution\
    \ protocol\n   (and a service discovery mechanism).  CNRP will give users access\
    \ to\n   the largest selection of services and providers and the ability to\n\
    \   select a specific resolution service over another.  To preserve the\n   user\
    \ from proprietary implementations, the existence of CNRP is a\n   prerequisite.\n"
- title: 7. Example of cost recovery models for maintenance of namespaces
  contents:
  - "7. Example of cost recovery models for maintenance of namespaces\n   The following\
    \ discussion of possible business models for common name\n   namespaces is intended\
    \ to prove that they are commercially viable,\n   hence that CNRP will be used\
    \ in the market place.  This section\n   presents 5 different cost recovery models.\n\
    \   a. Licensing the lookup service\n      In such model, the owner of the database\
    \ owner licenses the data\n      and the resolution service to a portal.  This\
    \ is a proven model.\n      For example, Looksmart (a directory service) recently\
    \ licensed all\n      their data to MSN.  Another possibility is to sell access\
    \ to the\n      service directly to the user.  For some vertical type of common\n\
    \      names service (e.g. patent search), it is also conceivable that a\n   \
    \   specific type of users (e.g., lawyers) would be willing to pay for\n     \
    \ accessing a precise resolution service.\n   b. Sharing revenue generated by\
    \ banner advertising\n      In this model, the database owner licenses his infrastructure\n\
    \      (data and resolution service) to a portal.  Prepaid banner ads are\n  \
    \    placed on the result pages.  The revenue is shared between the\n      resolution\
    \ service provider and the portal that hosts the pages.\n   c. Selling the names\
    \ (charge the customer a fee for subscribing a\n      name)\n      This is a proven\
    \ business model as well (NSI, GOTO, RealNames,\n      Netword, for of the name\
    \ has a large user reach (search engines\n      sell keywords for instance).\n\
    \   d. Value added service\n      Another model is to build a common name as a\
    \ free added value\n      service in order to make a core service more compelling\
    \ to users.\n      For example, Amazon.com could create a common name namespace\
    \ of\n      book titles and make it freely available to its users.  Amazon.com\n\
    \      would not make any money from the resolution service per se.\n      However,\
    \ it would indirectly since the service would help the\n      users find hence\
    \ buy more books from Amazon.com.\n   e. \"Some-strings-attached\" free names\n\
    \      A namespace may give users a name for free in exchange for\n      something\
    \ else (capturing the user's profile that can be sold to\n      merchants, capturing\
    \ the user's email address in order to send\n      advertising emails, etc.).\n"
