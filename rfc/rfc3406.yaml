- title: 1.0 Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.0 Introduction\n   Uniform Resource Names (URNs) are resource identifiers with\
    \ the\n   specific requirements for enabling location independent\n   identification\
    \ of a resource, as well as longevity of reference.\n   URNs are part of the larger\
    \ Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) family\n   [RFC3305] with the specific goal\
    \ of providing persistent naming of\n   resources.\n   There are 2 assumptions\
    \ that are key to this document:\n   Assumption #1:\n      Assignment of a URN\
    \ is a managed process.\n      I.e., not all strings that conform to URN syntax\
    \ are necessarily\n      valid URNs.  A URN is assigned according to the rules\
    \ of a\n      particular namespace (in terms of syntax, semantics, and process).\n\
    \   Assumption #2:\n      The space of URN namespaces is managed.\n      I.e.,\
    \ not all syntactically correct URN namespaces (per the URN\n      syntax definition)\
    \ are valid URN namespaces.  A URN namespace must\n      have a recognized definition\
    \ in order to be valid.\n   The purpose of this document is to outline a mechanism\
    \ and provide a\n   template for explicit namespace definition, as well as provide\
    \ the\n   mechanism for associating an identifier (called a \"Namespace ID\",\
    \ or\n   NID) which is registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority\n\
    \   (IANA).\n   Note that this document restricts itself to the description of\n\
    \   processes for the creation of URN namespaces.  If \"resolution\" of any\n\
    \   so-created URN identifiers is desired, a separate process of\n   registration\
    \ in a global NID directory, such as that provided by the\n   DDDS system [RFC3401],\
    \ is necessary.  See [RFC3405] for information\n   on obtaining registration in\
    \ the DDDS global NID directory.\n"
- title: 2.0 What is a URN Namespace?
  contents:
  - "2.0 What is a URN Namespace?\n   For the purposes of URNs, a \"namespace\" is\
    \ a collection of uniquely-\n   assigned identifiers.  That is, the identifiers\
    \ are not ever assigned\n   to more than 1 resource, nor are they ever re-assigned\
    \ to a different\n   resource.  A single resource, however, may have more than\
    \ one URN\n   assigned to it for different purposes.  A URN namespace itself has\
    \ an\n   identifier in order to:\n      -  ensure global uniqueness of URNs\n\
    \      -  (where desired) provide a cue for the structure of the\n         identifier\n\
    \   For example, many identifier systems may use strings of numbers as\n   identifiers\
    \ (e.g., ISBN, ISSN, phone numbers).  It is conceivable\n   that there might be\
    \ some numbers that are valid identifiers in two\n   different established identifier\
    \ systems.  Using different\n   designators for the two collections ensures that\
    \ no two URNs will be\n   the same for different resources (since each collection\
    \ is required\n   to uniquely assign each identifier).\n   The development of\
    \ an identifier structure, and thereby a collection\n   of identifiers, is a process\
    \ that is inherently dependent on the\n   requirements of the community defining\
    \ the identifier, how they will\n   be assigned, and the uses to which they will\
    \ be put.  All of these\n   issues are specific to the individual community seeking\
    \ to define a\n   namespace (e.g., publishing community, association of booksellers,\n\
    \   protocol developers, etc); they are beyond the scope of the IETF URN\n   work.\n\
    \   This document outlines the processes by which a collection of\n   identifiers\
    \ satisfying certain constraints (uniqueness of assignment,\n   etc) can become\
    \ a bona fide URN namespace by obtaining a NID.  In a\n   nutshell, a template\
    \ for the definition of the namespace is completed\n   for deposit with IANA,\
    \ and a NID is assigned.  The details of the\n   process and possibilities for\
    \ NID strings are outlined below.\n"
- title: 3.0 URN Namespace (Registration) Types
  contents:
  - "3.0 URN Namespace (Registration) Types\n   There are three categories of URN\
    \ namespaces defined here,\n   distinguished by expected level of service and\
    \ required procedures\n   for registration.  Registration processes for each of\
    \ these namespace\n   types are given in Section 4.0.\n"
- title: 3.1  Experimental Namespaces
  contents:
  - "3.1  Experimental Namespaces\n   These are not explicitly registered with IANA.\
    \  They take the form:\n      X-<NID>\n   No provision is made for avoiding collision\
    \ of experimental NIDs;\n   they are intended for use within internal or limited\
    \ experimental\n   contexts.\n"
- title: 3.2 Informal Namespaces
  contents:
  - "3.2 Informal Namespaces\n   These are fully fledged URN namespaces, with all\
    \ the rights and\n   requirements associated thereto.  Informal namespaces can\
    \ be\n   registered in global registration services.  They are required to\n \
    \  uphold the general principles of a well-managed URN namespace --\n   providing\
    \ persistent identification of resources, and unique\n   assignment of identifier\
    \ strings.  Informal and formal namespaces\n   (described below) differ in the\
    \ NID assignment.  IANA will assign an\n   alphanumeric NID to registered informal\
    \ namespaces, per the process\n   outlined in Section 4.0.\n"
- title: 3.3 Formal Namespaces
  contents:
  - "3.3 Formal Namespaces\n   A formal namespace may be requested, and IETF review\
    \ sought, in cases\n   where the publication of the NID proposal and the underlying\n\
    \   namespace will provide benefit to some subset of users on the\n   Internet.\
    \  That is, a formal NID proposal, if accepted, must be\n   functional on and\
    \ with the global Internet, not limited to users in\n   communities or networks\
    \ not connected to the Internet.  For example,\n   a NID that is meant for naming\
    \ of physics research is requested.  If\n   that NID request required that the\
    \ user use a proprietary network or\n   service that was not at all open to the\
    \ general Internet user, then\n   it would make a poor request for a formal NID.\
    \  The intent is that,\n   while the community of those who may actively use the\
    \ names assigned\n   within that NID may be small (but no less important), the\
    \ potential\n   use of names within that NID is open to any user on the Internet.\n\
    \   It is expected that Formal NIDs may be applied to namespaces where\n   some\
    \ aspects are not fully open.  For example, a namespace may make\n   use of a\
    \ fee-based, privately managed, or proprietary registry for\n   assignment of\
    \ URNs in the namespace, but it may still provide benefit\n   to some Internet\
    \ users if the services associated have openly-\n   published access protocols.\n\
    \   In addition to the basic registration information defined in the\n   registration\
    \ template (in Appendix A), a formal namespace request\n   must be accompanied\
    \ by documented considerations of the need for a\n   new namespace and of the\
    \ community benefit from formally establishing\n   the proposed URN namespace.\n\
    \   Additionally, since the goal of URNs is to provide persistent\n   identification,\
    \ some consideration as to the longevity and\n   maintainability of the namespace\
    \ must be given.  The URN WG discussed\n   at length the issue of finding objective\
    \ measures for predicting (a\n   priori) the continued success of a namespace.\
    \  No conclusion was\n   reached -- much depends on factors that are completely\
    \ beyond the\n   technical scope of the namespace.  However, the collective experience\n\
    \   of the IETF community does contain a wealth of information on\n   technical\
    \ factors that will prevent longevity of identification.  The\n   IESG may elect\
    \ not to publish a proposed namespace RFC if the IETF\n   community consensus\
    \ is that it contains technical flaws that will\n   prevent (or seriously impair\
    \ the possibility of) persistent\n   identification.\n   The kinds of things the\
    \ URN WG discussed included:\n      -  the organization maintaining the URN namespace\
    \ should\n         demonstrate stability and the ability to maintain the URN\n\
    \         namespace for a long time, and/or it should be clear how the\n     \
    \    namespace can continue to be usable/useful if the organization\n        \
    \ ceases to be able to foster it;\n      - it should demonstrate ability and competency\
    \ in name assignment.\n         This should improve the likelihood of persistence\
    \ (e.g. to\n         minimize the likelihood of conflicts);\n      -  it should\
    \ commit to not re-assigning existing names and\n         allowing old names to\
    \ continue to be valid, even if the owners\n         or assignees of those names\
    \ are no longer members or customers\n         of that organization.  This does\
    \ not mean that there must be\n         resolution of such names, but that they\
    \ must not resolve the\n         name to false or stale information, and that\
    \ they must not be\n         reassigned.\n   These aspects, though hard to quantify\
    \ objectively, should be\n   considered by organizations/people considering the\
    \ development of a\n   Formal URN namespace, and they will be kept in mind when\
    \ evaluating\n   the technical merits of any proposed Formal namespace.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.0 URN Namespace Registration, Update, and NID Assignment Process\n   Different\
    \ levels of disclosure are expected/defined for namespaces.\n   According to the\
    \ level of open-forum discussion surrounding the\n   disclosure, a URN namespace\
    \ may be assigned or may request a\n   particular identifier.  The  \"IANA Considerations\"\
    \ document [RFC2434]\n   suggests the need to specify update mechanisms for registrations\
    \ --\n   who is given the authority to do so, from time to time, and what are\n\
    \   the processes.  Since URNs are meant to be persistently useful, few\n   (if\
    \ any) changes should be made to the structural interpretation of\n   URN strings\
    \ (e.g., adding or removing rules for lexical equivalence\n   that might affect\
    \ the interpretation of URN IDs already assigned).\n   However, it may be important\
    \ to introduce clarifications, expand the\n   list of authorized URN assigners,\
    \ etc, over the natural course of a\n   namespace's lifetime.  Specific processes\
    \ are outlined below.\n   The official list of registered URN namespaces is maintained\
    \ by IANA.\n   URN namespace registrations are currently being posted in the\n\
    \   anonymous FTP directory:\n      http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces\n\
    \   See [RFC3232] for the current location of IANA registry.\n   The registration\

    \ in Section 3.0) to another.\n"

    \n   Thus, the Formal NID application is made via publication of an RFC\n   through\

    \      (Note that the definition of \"resource\" is fairly broad; for\n      example,\
    \ information on \"Today's Weather\" might be considered a\n      single resource,\
    \ although the content is dynamic.)\n      Possible answers include, but are not\
    \ limited to:\n      -  exposition of the structure of the identifiers, and\n\
    \         partitioning of the space of identifiers amongst assignment\n      \
    \   authorities which are individually responsible for respecting\n         uniqueness\
    \ rules\n      -  identifiers are assigned sequentially\n      -  information\
    \ is withheld; the namespace is opaque\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n\
    \      Although non-reassignment of URN identifiers ensures that a URN\n     \
    \ will persist in identifying a particular resource even after the\n      \"lifetime\
    \ of the resource\", some consideration should be given to\n      the persistence\
    \ of the usability of the URN.  This is particularly\n      important in the case\
    \ of URN namespaces providing global\n      resolution.\n      Possible answers\
    \ include, but are not limited to:\n      -  quality of service considerations\n\
    \   Process of identifier assignment:\n      This section should detail the mechanisms\
    \ and/or authorities for\n      assigning URNs to resources.  It should make clear\
    \ whether\n      assignment is completely open, or if limited, how to become an\n\
    \      assigner of identifiers, and/or get one assigned by existing\n      assignment\
    \ authorities.\n      Answers could include, but are not limited to:\n      -\
    \  assignment is completely open, following a particular algorithm\n      -  assignment\
    \ is delegated to authorities recognized by a\n         particular organization\
    \ (e.g., the Digital Object Identifier\n         Foundation controls the DOI assignment\
    \ space and its\n         delegation)\n      -  assignment is completely closed\
    \ (e.g., for a private\n         organization)\n   Process for identifier resolution:\n\
    \      If a namespace is intended to be accessible for global resolution,\n  \
    \    it must be registered in an RDS (Resolution Discovery System, see\n     \
    \ [RFC2276]) such as DDDS.  Resolution then proceeds according to\n      standard\
    \ URI resolution processes, and the mechanisms of the RDS.\n      What this section\
    \ should outline is the requirements for becoming\n      a recognized resolver\
    \ of URNs in this namespace (and being so-\n      listed in the RDS registry).\n\
    \      Answers may include, but are not limited to:\n      -  the namespace is\
    \ not listed with an RDS; this is not relevant\n      -  resolution mirroring\
    \ is completely open, with a mechanism for\n         updating an appropriate RDS\n\
    \      -  resolution is controlled by entities to which assignment has\n     \
    \    been delegated\n   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n      If there are particular\
    \ algorithms for determining equivalence\n      between two identifiers in the\
    \ underlying namespace (hence, in the\n      URN string itself), rules can be\
    \ provided here.\n      Some examples include:\n      -  equivalence between hyphenated\
    \ and non-hyphenated groupings in\n         the identifier string\n      -  equivalence\
    \ between single-quotes and double-quotes\n      -  Namespace-defined equivalences\
    \ between specific characters,\n         such as \"character X with or without\
    \ diacritic marks\".\n      Note that these are not normative statements for any\
    \ kind of best\n      practice for handling equivalences between characters; they\
    \ are\n      statements limited to reflecting the namespace's own rules.\n   Conformance\
    \ with URN Syntax:\n      This section should outline any special considerations\
    \ required\n      for conforming with the URN syntax.  This is particularly\n\
    \      applicable in the case of legacy naming systems that are used in\n    \
    \  the context of URNs.\n      For example, if a namespace is used in contexts\
    \ other than URNs,\n      it may make use of characters that are reserved in the\
    \ URN syntax.\n      This section should flag any such characters, and outline\n\
    \      necessary mappings to conform to URN syntax.  Normally, this will\n   \
    \   be handled by hex encoding the symbol.\n      For example, see the section\
    \ on SICIs in [RFC2288].\n   Validation mechanism:\n      Apart from attempting\
    \ resolution of a URN, a URN namespace may\n      provide mechanisms for \"validating\"\
    \ a URN -- i.e., determining\n      whether a given string is currently a validly-assigned\
    \ URN.  There\n      are 2 issues here: 1) users should not \"guess\" URNs in\
    \ a\n      namespace; 2) when the URN namespace is based on an existing\n    \
    \  identifier system, it may not be the case that all the existing\n      identifiers\
    \ are assigned on Day 0.  The reasonable expectation is\n      that the resource\
    \ associated with each resulting URN is somehow\n      related to the thing identified\
    \ by the original identifier system,\n      but those resources may not exist\
    \ for each original identifier.\n      For example, even if a telephone number-based\
    \ URN namespace was\n      created, it is not clear that all telephone numbers\
    \ would\n      immediately become \"valid\" URNs, that could be resolved using\n\
    \      whatever mechanisms are described as part of the namespace\n      registration.\n\
    \      Validation mechanisms might be:\n      -  a syntax grammar\n      -  an\
    \ on-line service\n      -  an off-line service\n   Scope:\n      This section\
    \ should outline the scope of the use of the\n      identifiers in this namespace.\
    \  Apart from considerations of\n      private vs. public namespaces, this section\
    \ is critical in\n      evaluating the applicability of a requested NID.  For\
    \ example, a\n      namespace claiming to deal in \"social security numbers\"\
    \ should\n      have a global scope and address all social security number\n \
    \     structures (unlikely).  On the other hand, at a national level, it\n   \
    \   is reasonable to propose a URN namespace for \"this nation's social\n    \
    \  security numbers\".\n"
