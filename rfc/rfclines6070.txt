Abstract This document contains test vectors for the Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)
#5 Password Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) with the Hash based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)
Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA 1) pseudorandom function.
The Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)
Based Key Derivation Function 2
(PBKDF2) is used by several protocols to derive encryption keys from a password.
For example, Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM)
[RFC5802] uses PBKDF2 with Hash based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)
[RFC2104] and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA 1)
Test vectors for the algorithm were not included in the original specification, but are often useful for implementers.
This document addresses the shortcoming.
PBKDF2 HMAC SHA1 Test Vectors
The input strings below are encoded using ASCII [ANSI.X3 4.1986].
The sequence "\0" (without quotation marks) means a literal ASCII NUL value (1 octet).
"DK" refers to the Derived Key.

The security considerations in [RFC2898] apply.
This document does not introduce any new security considerations.
