  - "1.  Introduction\n   This specification defines the media types of the Voice\
    \ Extensible\n   Markup Language (VoiceXML), the Speech Synthesis Markup Language\n\
    \   (SSML), the Speech Recognition Grammar Specification (SRGS), the Call\n  \
    \ Control XML (CCXML), and the Pronunciation Lexicon Specification\n   (PLS),\
    \ the specifications of the W3C Speech Interface Framework.\n   VoiceXML ([VoiceXML2.0])\
    \ is an Extensible Markup Language (XML)\n   designed for creating audio dialogs\
    \ that feature synthesized speech,\n   digitized audio, recognition of spoken\
    \ and DTMF key input, recording\n   of spoken input, telephony, and mixed initiative\
    \ conversations.  The\n   associated media type defined in this document is\n\
    \   \"application/voicexml+xml\".\n   The Speech Synthesis Markup Language specification\
    \ (SSML) defines an\n   XML-based markup language for assisting the generation\
    \ of synthetic\n   speech in Web and other applications.  The essential role of\
    \ SSML is\n   to provide authors of synthesizable content a standard way to control\n\
    \   aspects of speech such as pronunciation, volume, pitch, and rate,\n   across\
    \ different synthesis-capable platforms.  The associated media\n   type defined\
    \ in this document is \"application/ssml+xml\".\n   The Speech Recognition Grammar\
    \ Specification (SRGS) defines syntax\n   for representing grammars for use in\
    \ speech recognition so that\n   developers can specify the words and patterns\
    \ of words to be listened\n   for by a speech recognizer.  The syntax of the grammar\
    \ format exists\n   in two forms, an Augmented BNF (ABNF) Form and an XML Form.\
    \  The\n   respective media types defined in this document are\n   \"application/srgs\"\
    \ and \"application/srgs+xml\".\n   The Call Control EXtensible Markup Language\
    \ (CCXML) is an XML\n   designed to provide telephony call control support for\
    \ dialog\n   systems, such as VoiceXML.  The associated media type defined in\
    \ this\n   document is \"application/ccxml+xml\".\n   The Pronunciation Lexicon\
    \ Specification (PLS) defines an XML syntax\n   for specifying pronunciation lexicons\
    \ to be used by speech\n   recognition and speech synthesis engines in voice browser\n\
    \   applications.  The associated media type defined in this document is\n   \"\
    application/pls+xml\".\n"

    \   specifications, it is possible that the registered media types may\n   describe\
    \ content that has security implications beyond those\n   described here.  However,\
    \ if the processor follows only the normative\n   semantics of the specifications,\
    \ this content will be ignored.  Only\n   in the case where the processor recognizes\
    \ and processes the\n   additional content, or where further processing of that\
    \ content is\n   dispatched to other processors, would security issues potentially\n\

  contents:
  - "3.6.1.  Magic Numbers\n   The ABNF self-identifying header must be present in\
    \ any legal stand-\n   alone ABNF Form grammar document.  The first character\
    \ of an ABNF\n   document must be the \"#\" symbol (x23) unless preceded by an\
    \ optional\n   XML 1.0 byte order mark.  The ABNF byte order mark follows the\
    \ XML\n   definition and requirements.  For example, documents encoded in UTF-\n\
    \   16 must begin with the byte order mark.  The optional byte order mark\n  \
    \ and required \"#\" symbol must be followed immediately by the exact\n   string\
    \ \"ABNF\" (x41 x42 x4d x46) or the appropriate equivalent for the\n   document's\
    \ encoding (e.g., for UTF-16 little-endian: x23 x00 x41 x00\n   x42 x00 x4d x00\
    \ x46 x00).  If the byte order mark is absent on a\n   grammar encoded in UTF-16,\
    \ then the grammar processor should perform\n   auto-detection of character encoding\
    \ in a manner analogous to auto-\n   detection of character encoding in XML. \
    \ Next follows a single-space\n   character (x20) and the required version number,\
    \ which is \"1.0\" for\n   this specification (x31 x2e x30).\n"
