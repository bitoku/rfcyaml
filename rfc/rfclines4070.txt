Abstract This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes objects used for managing the Line Code Specific parameters of Very High Speed Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL)
interfaces using Multiple Carrier Modulation (MCM) Line Coding.
It is an optional extension to the VDSL LINE MIB, RFC 3728, which handles line code independent objects.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
This document describes an SNMP MIB module for managing the Line Code Dependent, Physical Medium Dependent (PMD), Layer of MCM VDSL Lines.
These definitions are based upon the specifications for VDSL as defined in T1E1, European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), and International Telecommunication Union (ITU) documentation [T1E1311, T1E1011, T1E1013, ETSI2701, ETSI2702, ITU9931, ITU9971].
Additionally the protocol dependent (and line code dependent) management framework for VDSL lines specified by the Digital Subscriber Line Forum (DSLF) has been taken into consideration [DSLFTR57].
The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2 transmission.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "RECOMMENDED", and "SHOULD" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
Relationship of this MIB Module to other MIB Modules
The relationship of the VDSL Line MIB module to other MIB modules and in particular to the IF MIB, as presented in RFC 2863 [RFC2863], is discussed in the VDSL LINE MIB, RFC 3728 [RFC3728].
This section outlines the relationship of this VDSL Line Extension MIB to the VDSL LINE MIB, RFC 3728 [RFC3728].

The MCM VDSL Line Extension MIB contains the following MIB group:
This group supports MIB objects for defining configuration profiles and for monitoring individual bands of Multiple Carrier Modulation (MCM)
It contains the following tables:
If the MCM VDSL Line Extension MIB is implemented then all of the objects in this group MUST be implemented.
Figure 1, below, displays the relationship of the tables in the vdslMCMGroup to the vdslGroup and to the ifEntry:
1) vdslLineTableEntry (vdslLineCoding MCM) vdslLineConfProfileEntry(vdslLineConfProfileName)
When the object vdslLineCoding is set to MCM, vdslLineConfProfileName is used as the index to each of the six vdslLineMCMConfProfile Tables.
The existence of an entry in any of the tables of the vdslMCMGroup is optional.
Persistence All read create objects defined in this MIB module SHOULD be stored persistently.
Following is an exhaustive list of these persistent objects:
vdslMCMConfProfileMaxRxPSDRowStatus Note also that the interface indices in this MIB are maintained persistently.
Access Control Model (VACM) data relating to these SHOULD be stored persistently as well [RFC3415].
An MCM based VDSL agent does not have to implement this MIB to be compliant with RFC 3728
If the MCM VDSL Line Extension MIB is implemented then the following group is mandatory:  vdslMCMGroup 4.

The VDSL LINE MIB found in RFC 3728 defines objects for the management of a pair of VDSL transceivers at each end of the VDSL line.
The VDSL LINE MIB configures and monitors the line code independent parameters (TC layer) of the VDSL line.
This MIB module is an optional extension of the VDSL LINE MIB and defines objects for configuration and monitoring of the line code specific (LCS) elements (PMD layer) for VDSL lines using MCM coding.
The objects in this extension MIB MUST NOT be used for VDSL lines using Single Carrier Modulation (SCM) line coding.
If an object in this extension MIB is referenced by a line which does not use MCM, it has no effect on the operation of that line.

vdslLineExtMCMMibCompliance MODULE COMPLIANCE STATUS  current DESCRIPTION
"The compliance statement for SNMP entities which manage VDSL interfaces."
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
vdslLineMCMConfProfileTable, vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxWindowLength, vdslLineMCMConfProfileRowStatus, vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxBandTable, vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxBandStart, vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxBandStop, vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxBandRowStatus, vdslLineMCMConfProfileRxBandTable, vdslLineMCMConfProfileRxBandStart, vdslLineMCMConfProfileRxBandStop, vdslLineMCMConfProfileRxBandRowStatus, vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxPSDTable, vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxPSDTone, vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxPSDPSD, vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxPSDRowStatus, vdslLineMCMConfProfileMaxTxPSDTable vdslLineMCMConfProfileMaxTxPSDTone, vdslLineMCMConfProfileMaxTxPSDPSD, vdslLineMCMConfProfileMaxTxPSDRowStatus, vdslLineMCMConfProfileMaxRxPSDTable
vdslLineMCMConfProfileMaxRxPSDTone, vdslLineMCMConfProfileMaxRxPSDPSD, vdslLineMCMConfProfileMaxRxPSDRowStatus VDSL layer connectivity from the Vtur will permit the subscriber to manipulate both the VDSL link directly and the VDSL embedded operations channel (EOC) for their own loop.
For example, unchecked or unfiltered fluctuations initiated by the subscriber could generate sufficient notifications to potentially overwhelm either the management interface to the network or the element manager.
Additionally, allowing write access to configuration data may allow an end user to increase their service levels or affect other end  users in either a positive or negative manner.
For this reason, the tables and objects listed above should be considered to contain sensitive information.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
vdslLineMCMConfProfileTable, vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxWindowLength, vdslLineMCMConfProfileRowStatus, vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxBandTable, vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxBandStart, vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxBandStop, vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxBandRowStatus, vdslLineMCMConfProfileRxBandTable, vdslLineMCMConfProfileRxBandStart, vdslLineMCMConfProfileRxBandStop, vdslLineMCMConfProfileRxBandRowStatus, vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxPSDTable, vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxPSDTone, vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxPSDPSD, vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxPSDRowStatus, vdslLineMCMConfProfileMaxTxPSDTable vdslLineMCMConfProfileMaxTxPSDTone, vdslLineMCMConfProfileMaxTxPSDPSD, vdslLineMCMConfProfileMaxTxPSDRowStatus, vdslLineMCMConfProfileMaxRxPSDTable
access of the physical band parameters may provide knowledge to an end user that would allow malicious behavior, for example the application of an intentional interference on one or all of the physical bands in use.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of a MIB module which utilizes the textual conventions defined in this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
The IANA has assigned the transmission value 229 to VDSL LINE EXT  MCM MIB.
