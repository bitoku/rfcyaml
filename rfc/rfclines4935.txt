This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects for information related to a Fibre Channel network's Fabric Configuration Server function, which provides a means by which a management application can discover Fibre Channel fabric topology and attributes.
Discovered topology includes Interconnect Elements (i.e., switches, hubs, bridges, etc.)
and their ports, as well as "platforms" that consist of one or more Fibre Channel nodes.

The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
Short Overview of Fibre Channel
The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point to point serial data channel, structured for high performance.
Fibre Channel provides a general transport vehicle for higher level protocols such as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)
command sets, the High  Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and others.
Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple communication points, called N Ports, interconnected either by a switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point to point link.
A Fibre Channel "node" consists of one or more N Ports.
A Fabric may consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are switches.
An N Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch called an F Port.
When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single port on a switch via an "Arbitrated Loop" topology, the switch port is called an FL Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL Ports.
Nx Port is used to refer to either an N Port or an NL Port.
Fx Port is used to refer to either an F Port or an FL Port.
A switch port, which is interconnected to another switch port via an Inter Switch Link (ISL), is called an E Port.
A B Port connects a bridge device with an E Port on a switch; a B Port provides a subset of E Port functionality.
Many Fibre Channel components, including the Fabric, each node, and most ports, have globally unique names.
These globally unique names are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).
More information on WWNs can be found in [FC FS].
WWNs are expected to be persistent across agent and unit resets.
Fibre Channel frames contain 24 bit address identifiers that identify the frame's source and destination ports.
Each FC port has both an address identifier and a WWN.
When a Fabric is in use, the FC address identifiers are dynamic and are assigned by a switch.
Each octet of a 24 bit address represents a level in an address hierarchy, with a Domain ID being the highest level of the hierarchy.
The Fibre Channel Fabric Configuration Server provides a way for a management application to discover Fibre Channel fabric topology and attributes.
The Fabric Configuration Server is designed so that it can be distributed among switches and accessed from any Nx Port.
However, the Fabric Configuration Server is not restricted or required to be part of/within a Fabric.
The information registered with and available from each Fabric Configuration Server is modeled as a Fabric consisting of one or more Interconnect Elements that each have some number of physical Ports, and one or more Fibre Channel nodes grouped together into Platforms to facilitate discovery and management.
The Ports are connected either to other Ports on other Interconnect Elements, or to Nx Ports.
Each Interconnect Element may have attributes including its name, type, Domain Identifier, Management Identifier, Logical Name, Management Address(es), Information List, Zoning Enforcement Status, etc.
Each Port may have attributes including its name, type, TX type, Module type, physical port number, attached port name(s), port state, speed, etc.
Each platform may have attributes including its name, type, description, label, location, management address, etc.
The Fibre Channel Fabric Configuration Server is defined in the FC GS specification.
The Fabric Configuration Server is one of a set of functions that are collectively known as the Management Service.
The latest version of the specification is [FC GS 5].
The latest standard for an interconnecting Fabric containing multiple Fabric Switch elements is [FC SW 4].
[FC SW 4] carries forward the earlier specification for the operation of a single Fabric in a physical infrastructure, and augments it with the definition of Virtual Fabrics and with the specification of how multiple Virtual Fabrics can operate within one (or more) physical infrastructures.
The use of Virtual Fabrics provides for each frame to be tagged in its header to indicate which one of several Virtual Fabrics that frame is being transmitted on.
All frames entering a particular "Core Switch" [FC SW 4]
(i.e., a physical switch) on the same Virtual Fabric are processed by the same "Virtual Switch" within that Core Switch.
The first standardized MIB for Fibre Channel [RFC2837] was focused on Fibre Channel switches.
It has been replaced by the more generic Fibre Channel Management MIB [RFC4044], which defines basic information for Fibre Channel hosts and switches, including extensions to the standard IF MIB for Fibre Channel interfaces.
This MIB extends beyond [RFC4044] to cover the functionality, in Fibre Channel switches, of providing Fibre Channel's Fabric Configuration Server function.
This MIB imports some common Textual Conventions from T11 TC MIB [RFC4439] and from T11 FC NAME SERVER MIB [RFC4438].
It also imports URLString from NETWORK SERVICES
This MIB module provides the means for monitoring the operation of, and configuring some parameters of, one or more Fabric Configuration Servers (FCS) in a Fibre Channel (FC) network.
The capabilities provided include triggering a discovery of the configuration of one or more Fabrics, retrieving the results of such a discovery, as well as controlling and monitoring the operation of an FCS.
The discovered configuration contains information about: Interconnect Elements (IEs), i.e., switches, hubs, bridges, etc., Ports on IEs, and Platforms that consist of one or more FC nodes.
Fibre Channel Management Instance A Fibre Channel management instance is defined in [RFC4044] as a separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality.
Fibre Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel management instances in whatever way is most convenient for the implementation(s).
For example, one such grouping accommodates a single SNMP agent having multiple AgentX
[RFC2741] sub agents, with each sub agent implementing a different Fibre Channel management instance.
The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC MGMT MIB [RFC4044] as the index value to uniquely identify each Fibre Channel management instance, for example, within the same SNMP context ([RFC3411], section 3.3.1).
MIB [RFC4044] defines the fcmSwitchTable as a table of information about Fibre Channel switches that are managed by Fibre Channel management instances.
Each Fibre Channel management instance can manage one or more Fibre Channel switches.
The Switch Index, fcmSwitchIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC MGMT MIB as the index value to uniquely identify a Fibre Channel switch amongst those (one or more) managed by the same Fibre Channel management instance.
Fabric Index With multiple Fabrics, each Fabric has its own instances of the Fabric related management instrumentation.
Thus, this MIB defines all Fabric related information in tables that are INDEXed by an arbitrary integer, named a "Fabric Index".
The syntax of a Fabric Index is T11FabricIndex, imported from T11 TC MIB [RFC4439].
When a device is connected to a single physical Fabric, without use of any virtual Fabrics, the value of this Fabric Index will always be 1.
In an environment of multiple virtual and/or physical Fabrics, this index provides a means to distinguish one Fabric from another.
It is quite possible, and may even be likely, that a Fibre Channel switch will have ports connected to multiple virtual and/or physical Fabrics.
Thus, in order to simplify a management protocol query concerning all the Fabrics to which a single switch is connected, fcmSwitchIndex will be listed before t11FcsFabricIndex when they both appear in the same INDEX clause.
This section describes the six MIB groups contained in the MIB module.
t11FcsDiscoveredConfigGroup Group This group contains the Fabric configuration information discovered by Fabric Configuration Servers.
This group contains objects by which to monitor the status of discovery of Fabric configurations by Fabric Configuration Servers.
This group contains objects for requesting a Fabric Configuration Server to discover the configuration of one or more Fabrics.
The t11FcsStatisticsGroup Group This group contains objects for Fabric Configuration Server statistics information.
This group contains three notifications, generated when an FCS: rejects a registration, deregistration, or query request; completes discovery on a range of Fabrics; learns that a management address of an Interconnect Element has changed.
When defining SNMP notifications for events that occur in the data  plane, the maximum frequency of their generation needs to be considered.
Unless there is some limiting factor, such notifications need to be flow controlled in some way, e.g., defined such that after some maximum number within a specified time interval have occurred, further notifications are suppressed for some subsequent time interval.
However, as and when such a suppression occurs, the Network Management System (NMS) that didn't receive the notifications (because they were suppressed) needs to be able to obtain an indication of how many were suppressed.
Therefore, an additional Counter32 object needs to be defined, and/or a new type of notification needs to be defined for use at the end of the interval.
While this is extra complexity, it is necessary for notifications that need to be flow controlled.
In contrast, for notifications such as all the ones defined in this MIB module, which are generated due to control plane events (and are not able to start a chain reaction): estimating the maximum number that could possibly be generated per unit time for each type of notification is too simplistic.
For example, it's unreasonable to ask how many of the t11FcsDiscoveryCompleteNotify notifications can be generated in a time interval, because it depends on several factors: how big is the network?
how many Virtual Fabrics need to be discovered?
how quickly can the operator ask for another discovery after the last one completes?
the extra complexity of flow controlling these types of notifications is not warranted.
This group contains notification control and notification information objects for monitoring Fabric Configuration Server request rejection and discovery of topology information.
OS Logical Unit Number (LUN)
A "Platform" is defined in FC GS 5 to be not only a set of zero or more FC nodes, but also a set of zero or more "OS LUN Map Entries" (see Figure 8 in [FC GS 5]).
Information on "OS LUN Map Entries" is not included in this T11 FC FABRIC CONFIG SERVER MIB.
Instead, information on LUN Maps can be obtained via the scsiLunMapGroup object group defined in the SCSI MIB [RFC4455].

"This object provides the capability to trigger the start of a discovery by a Fabric Configuration Server.
If this object is set to 'start', then the discovery is started on those Fabrics that have their Fabric Index value in the range specified by t11FcsFabricDiscoveryRangeLow and t11FcsFabricDiscoveryRangeHigh.
It is recommended that whenever an instance of this object is set to 'start', that the desired range be specified at the same time by setting the corresponding instances of t11FcsFabricDiscoveryRangeLow and t11FcsFabricDiscoveryRangeHigh.
Setting this object to 'start' will be rejected if a discovery is already/still in progress on any Fabrics in the specified range.

This table contains the status of discovery of locally known Fabrics."
In a Fabric conformant to FC SW 4, multiple Virtual Fabrics can operate within one (or more) physical infrastructures, and this index value is used to uniquely identify a particular (physical or virtual) Fabric within a physical infrastructure.
Initially when the switch comes up, all instances of this object have the value: 'localOnly', and the database contains only local information, i.e., no information discovered via the Fabric Configuration Server protocol specified in FC GS 5.
If t11FcsFabricDiscoveryStart is set to 'start' for a range of Fabrics that includes this Fabric, then the value of this object transitions to 'inProgress'.
When the discovery completes, this object transitions to 'completed', and the data is cached for the minimum interval of time specified by t11FcsFabricDiscoveryTimeOut.
After this interval has been exceeded, the data may be lost, in which case, the value of this object changes to 'localOnly'.
This object cannot be set via SNMP to any value other than 'localOnly'.
If this object is set (via SNMP) to 'localOnly', the cached data for the Fabric is discarded immediately, and if a discovery initiated from this switch was in progress for this Fabric, then that discovery is aborted."
"This object contains the value of sysUpTime at which discovery was most recently completed or aborted on this Fabric.

A table of Interconnect Elements.
Interconnect Elements (IEs) are switches, hubs, bridges etc.
By default, the Fabric Configuration Server will maintain detailed information pertaining only to local resources.
As far as discovered topology is concerned, only the IE name, type, and Domain ID information will be maintained.
If a discovery cycle is triggered on a set of Fabrics, this table along with the Port and Platform tables will be populated with the discovered information.
The discovered data will be retained in this table for at least t11FcsFabricDiscoveryTimeOut seconds after the completion of its discovery or until the discovered data is invalidated."

IANA Considerations IANA has assigned a MIB OID (162) under the mib 2 subtree.
There are several management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability is: t11FcsFabricDiscoveryRangeLow t11FcsFabricDiscoveryRangeHigh
the ability to specify parameters for, and trigger the start of, a topology discovery.
the ability to enable/disable notifications.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
For example, the ability to invalidate discovered topology may afford an attacker the ability to hide the presence of unauthorized equipment on the network.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: t11FcsIeTable t11FcsMgmtAddrListTable
t11FcsPlatformTable t11FcsNodeNameListTable   contains information about the topology of the Fibre Channel network.
t11FcsStatsTable   contains statistics information about the operation of the Fabric Configuration Server.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
