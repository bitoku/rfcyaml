    way, thus leaving the\n   treatment of this facility incomplete.\n   This document

    of it that are specified in the C-bindings\n   document but that should have been
    generic from the start.\n"

  - "4.  Generic Structure for GSS-API Channel Bindings\n   The base GSS-API version
    2, update 1 specification [RFC2743] provides\n   a facility for channel binding.
    \ It models channel bindings as an\n   OCTET STRING and leaves it to the GSS-API
    version 2, update 1\n   C-bindings specification to specify the structure of the
    contents of\n   the channel bindings OCTET STRINGs.  The C-bindings specification\n
    \  [RFC2744] then defines, in terms of C, what should have been a\n   generic
    structure for channel bindings.  The Kerberos V GSS mechanism\n   [RFC4121] also
    defines a method for encoding GSS channel bindings in\n   a way that is independent
    of the C-bindings -- otherwise, the\n   mechanism's channel binding facility would
    not be useable with other\n   language bindings.\n   In other words, the structure
    of GSS channel bindings given in\n   [RFC2744] is actually generic in spite of
    being specified in terms of\n   C concepts and syntax.\n   We generalize it as
    shown below, using the same pseudo-ASN.1 as is\n   used in RFC 2743.  Although
    the figure below is, indeed, a valid\n   ASN.1 [CCITT.X680] type, we do not provide
    a full ASN.1 module as\n   none is needed because no standard encoding of this
    structure is\n   needed -- the definition below is part of an abstract API, not
    part\n   of a protocol defining bits on the wire.  GSS-API mechanisms do need\n
    \  to encode the contents of this structure, but that encoding will be\n   mechanism
    specific (see below).\n      GSS-CHANNEL-BINDINGS ::= SEQUENCE {\n              initiator-address-type
    \ INTEGER,      -- See RFC2744\n              initiator-address       OCTET STRING,
    -- See RFC2744\n              acceptor-address-type   INTEGER,      -- See RFC2744\n
    \             acceptor-address        OCTET STRING, -- See RFC2744\n              application-data
    \       OCTET STRING  -- See RFC5056\n      }\n                Abstract GSS-API
    Channel Bindings Structure\n   The values for the address fields are described
    in [RFC2744].\n   New language-specific bindings of the GSS-API SHOULD specify
    a\n   language-specific formulation of this structure.\n   Where a language binding
    of the GSS-API models channel bindings as\n   OCTET STRINGs (or the language's
    equivalent), then the implementation\n   MUST assume that the given bindings correspond
    only to the\n   application-data field of GSS-CHANNEL-BINDINGS as shown above,
    rather\n   than some encoding of GSS-CHANNEL-BINDINGS.\n   As mentioned above,
    [RFC4121] describes an encoding of the above GSS-\n   CHANNEL-BINDINGS structure
    and then hashes that encoding.  Other GSS-\n   API mechanisms are free to use
    that encoding.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   For general security considerations relating
    to channel bindings, see\n   [RFC5056].\n   Language bindings that use OCTET STRING
    (or equivalent) for channel\n   bindings will not support the use of network addresses
    as channel\n   bindings.  This should not cause any security problems, as the
    use of\n   network addresses as channel bindings is not generally secure.\n   However,
    it is important that \"end-point channel bindings\" not be\n   modeled as network
    addresses; otherwise, such channel bindings may\n   not be useable with all language
    bindings of the GSS-API.\n"
