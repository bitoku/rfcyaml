  - "1.  Overview\n   In ATM or frame relay networks Intermediate Systems are inter-\n\
    \   connected using virtual circuits (VCs) which are logical point-to-\n   point\
    \ links.  Some organizations attach multiple Intermediate Systems\n   to form\
    \ a full \"mesh\" topology, where every pair of Intermediate\n   Systems are connected\
    \ by a point-to-point link.  In such topologies,\n   IS-IS protocol operation\
    \ leads to redundant transmission of certain\n   PDUs due to the flooding operation\
    \ which is illustrated below.\n   When an Intermediate System gets a new Link\
    \ State Protocol Data Unit\n   (LSP), it stores it, and prepares to flood it out\
    \ every circuit\n   except the source circuit.  This is done by setting SRM (Send\
    \ Routing\n   Message) bits held in the local copy of the LSP: there is an SRM\
    \ for\n   each circuit.\n    +----------+                             +----------+\n\

    \  It sets the SRM bits on circuits\n   I23 and I24, to flood the LSP to System3\
    \ and System4.  However, these\n   Intermediate Systems will get the LSP directly\
    \ from System1.  In a\n   full mesh of N Intermediate Systems, the standard protocol\
    \ mechanism\n   results in N-2 extra transmissions of each LSP, a waste of bandwidth\n\
    \   and processing effort, with little gain in reliability.\n   Mesh groups provide\
    \ a mechanism to reduce the flooding of LSPs.\n"
- title: 2.  Definitions of Mesh Groups
  contents:
  - "2.  Definitions of Mesh Groups\n   A mesh group is defined as a set of point-to-point\
    \ circuits which\n   provide full connectivity to a set of Intermediate Systems.\
    \  Each\n   circuit has two new attributes:  meshGroupEnabled, which is in state\n\
    \   {meshInactive, meshBlocked, or meshSet} and an integer variable\n   meshGroup,\
    \ which is valid only if the value of meshGroupEnabled\n   attribute is 'meshSet'.\
    \  Circuits that are in state 'meshSet' and\n   that have the same value of meshGroup\
    \ are said to be in the same mesh\n   group.\n   LSPs are not flooded over circuits\
    \ in 'meshBlocked' state, and an LSP\n   received on a circuit C is not flooded\
    \ out circuits that belong to\n   C's mesh group.\n   Section 7.3.15.1 clause\
    \ e.1.ii) of ISO 10589 [1] is modified as\n   follows:\n   e.1.ii)\n      if the\
    \ meshGroupEnabled attribute is 'meshSet' for the\n      circuit C, set the SRMflag\
    \ for that LSP for all circuits\n      other than C whose meshGroupEnabled attribute\
    \ is\n      'meshInactive'.  Also set the SRMflag for all circuits in\n      state\
    \ 'meshSet' whose meshGroup attribute is not the same\n      as C's.\n      if\
    \ the meshGroupEnabled attribute is 'meshInactive' for\n      circuit C, set the\
    \ SRMflag for that LSP for all circuits\n      other than C whose meshGroupEnabled\
    \ attribute is not\n      'meshBlocked'.\n   For robust database synchronization\
    \ when using mesh groups, the\n   Complete Sequence Number PDUs (CSNPs) are sent\
    \ periodically on\n   point-to-point links with a mesh group meshEnabled or meshBlocked.\n\
    \   Section 7.3.15.3 clause b) of ISO 10589 [1] is modified as follows:\n   b)\
    \   If C is a point-to-point circuit (including non-DA DED\n        circuits and\
    \ virtual links), then\n   1)   If the circuit's attribute is 'meshSet' or 'meshBlocked',\n\
    \        then for each valid level, the IS will send a complete\n        set of\
    \ CSNPs as described for a  Designated IS in section\n        7.3.15.3 clause\
    \ a).\n   2)   CSNPs are transmitted only at initialization on point-\n      \
    \  to-point links whose state is 'meshInactive'.\n   Use of mesh groups at an\
    \ Intermediate System also modifies the\n   behavior in transmission of generated\
    \ LSPs.  These LSPs are not\n   required to be transmitted over circuits in state\
    \ 'meshBlocked' at\n   system startup or when the LSP is regenerated.  The second\
    \ sentence\n   of Section 7.3.12  is modified to read:\n      \"For all the circuits\
    \ whose meshGroupEnabled attribute is\n      not 'meshBlocked', the IS shall set\
    \ the SRMflags for that\n      Link State PDU to propagate it on all these circuits.\
    \  The\n      IS shall clear the SRMflags for circuits whose\n      meshGroupEnabled\
    \ attribute is 'meshBlocked'.\"\n   Some of the transient transmission overhead\
    \ can be reduced by having\n   an Intermediate System not transmit its copies\
    \ of the LSPs in\n   database on a circuit start-up/restart if the circuit is\
    \ '\n   meshBlocked'.  The clause a) in the last part of Section 7.3.17 of\n \
    \  ISO 10589, which refers to the point-to-point circuits, is modified\n   as\
    \ follows:\n   a)   set SRMflag for that circuit on all LSPs if the\n        meshGroupEnabled\
    \ attribute of the circuit is not\n        'meshBlocked', and\n   Numbering of\
    \ mesh groups provides the ability to divide a large full\n   mesh topology into\
    \ a smaller group of full mesh sub-topologies (mesh\n   groups).  These mesh groups\
    \ are connected by \"transit\" circuits which\n   are 'meshInactive', while the\
    \ remaining circuits between the mesh\n   groups are configured as 'meshBlocked'\
    \ to reduce flooding redundancy.\n   Use of numbering makes mesh groups more scalable.\n"
- title: 3.  Drawbacks of Mesh Groups
  contents:
  - "3.  Drawbacks of Mesh Groups\n   The mesh group feature described in this document\
    \ is a simple\n   mechanism to reduce flooding of LSPs in some IS-IS topologies.\
    \  It\n   relies on a correct user configuration.  If a combination of user\n\
    \   configuration and link failures result in a partitioned flooding\n   topology,\
    \ LSPs will not be sent in a timely fashion, which may lead\n   to routing loops\
    \ or black holes.\n   The concept of using numbered mesh groups also suffers from\
    \ the\n   complexity and reliance on static configuration, making the\n   topologies\
    \ brittle.  Loosing a transit link can partition LSP\n   flooding in unpredictable\
    \ ways, requiring the periodic flooding of\n   CSNPs to synchronize databases.\
    \  In large networks, CSNPs become\n   large and also consume bandwidth.\n   The\
    \ authors are not aware of any networks that have deployed numbered\n   mesh groups:\
    \ instead, administrators set links to state 'meshBlocked'\n   to prune the flooding\
    \ topology (also known as \"poor man's mesh\n   groups\").\n   Some improvements\
    \ to mesh groups which have been suggested include:\n   a) To negotiate or check\
    \ the mesh group attributes during\n      initialization of an adjacency to verify\
    \ that the two ends of\n      every circuit hold identical values of the mesh\
    \ state and mesh\n      number.\n   b) Dynamic election of active transit links\
    \ so that a topology could\n      recover from failure of transit circuits.\n\
    \   c) Reduce the flooding of CSNPs by sending them periodically on some\n   \
    \   meshGroup circuits rather than all circuits.\n   d) Reduce the size of PDUs\
    \ required by flooding of CSNPs by sending\n      CSNP summaries: checksums or\
    \ sequence numbers.\n   e) A related problem is the unneeded multiple transmissions\
    \ of LSPs\n      to neighbors that are connected via multiple links.  The protocol\n\
    \      could use the remote system ID of each adjacency and attempt to\n     \
    \ send a single copy of each LSP to a neighbor.\n   Any such improvements are\
    \ outside the scope of this document, and may\n   be the basis for future work.\n"
- title: 4.  Interoperation with Mesh Groups
  contents:
  - "4.  Interoperation with Mesh Groups\n   Since mesh groups do not alter the content\
    \ of packets, an\n   Intermediate System that does not implement mesh groups will\
    \ not see\n   any different packets or new TLVs.  The only impact will be that\n\
    \   additional CSNPs will be seen on some point-to-point links.  A\n   conformant\
    \ implementation can be expected to respond correctly to\n   extra CSNPs.\n"
