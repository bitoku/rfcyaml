- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Session Description Protocol [SDP] provides a general\
    \ purpose\n   format for describing multimedia sessions in announcements or\n\
    \   invitations.  SDP uses an entirely textual data format (the US-ASCII\n   subset\
    \ of [UTF-8]) to maximize portability among transports.  SDP\n   does not define\
    \ a protocol, but only the syntax to describe a\n   multimedia session with sufficient\
    \ information to discover and\n   participate in that session.  Session descriptions\
    \ may be sent using\n   any number of existing application protocols for transport\
    \ (e.g.,\n   Session Announcement Protocol (SAP), SIP, Real Time Streaming\n \
    \  Protocol (RTSP), email, and HTTP).\n   Typically, session descriptions reference\
    \ an IP multicast address for\n   the \"connection-address\" (destination), though\
    \ unicast addresses or\n   fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) MAY also be used.\
    \  The \"source-\n   filter\" attribute defined in this document qualifies the\
    \ session\n   traffic by identifying the address (or FQDN) of legitimate sources\n\
    \   (senders).  The intent is for receivers to use the source and\n   destination\
    \ address pair(s) to filter traffic, so that applications\n   receive only legitimate\
    \ session traffic.\n   Receiver applications are expected to use the SDP source-filter\n\
    \   information to identify traffic from legitimate senders, and discard\n   traffic\
    \ from illegitimate senders.  Applications and hosts may also\n   share the source-filter\
    \ information with network elements (e.g., with\n   routers using [IGMPv3]) so\
    \ they can potentially perform the traffic\n   filtering operation further \"\
    upstream,\" closer to the source(s).\n   The \"source-filter\" attribute can appear\
    \ at the session level and/or\n   the media level.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Motivation\n   The purpose of a source-filter is to help protect receivers\
    \ from\n   traffic sent from illegitimate source addresses.  Filtering traffic\n\
    \   can help to preserve content integrity and protect against Denial of\n   Service\
    \ (DoS) attacks.\n   For multicast destination addresses, receiver applications\
    \ MAY apply\n   source-filters using the Multicast Source Filter APIs [MSF-API].\n\
    \   Hosts are likely to implement these APIs using protocol mechanisms to\n  \
    \ convey the source filters to local multicast routers.  Other\n   \"upstream\"\
    \ multicast routers MAY apply the filters and thereby\n   provide more explicit\
    \ multicast group management and efficient\n   utilization of network resources.\
    \  The protocol mechanisms to enable\n   these operations are beyond the scope\
    \ of this document, but their\n   potential provided motivation for SDP source-filters.\n"

- title: 3.  The "source-filter" Attribute
  contents:
  - "3.  The \"source-filter\" Attribute\n   The SDP source-filter attribute does\
    \ not change any existing SDP\n   syntax or semantics, but defines a format for\
    \ additional session\n   description information.  Specifically, source-filter\
    \ syntax can\n   prescribe one or more unicast addresses as either legitimate\
    \ or\n   illegitimate sources for any (or all) SDP session description\n   \"\
    connection-address\" field values.\n   Note that the unicast source addresses\
    \ specified by this attribute\n   are those that are seen by a receiver.  Therefore,\
    \ if source\n   addresses undergo translation en route from the original sender\
    \ to\n   the receiver - e.g., due to Network Address Translation (NAT) or some\n\
    \   tunneling mechanism - then the SDP \"source-filter\" attribute, as\n   presented\
    \ to the receiver, will not be accurate unless the source\n   addresses therein\
    \ are also translated accordingly.\n   The source-filter attribute has the following\
    \ syntax:\n       a=source-filter: <filter-mode> <filter-spec>\n   The <filter-mode>\
    \ is either \"incl\" or \"excl\" (for inclusion or\n   exclusion, respectively).\
    \  The <filter-spec> has four sub-components:\n       <nettype> <address-types>\
    \ <dest-address> <src-list>\n   A <filter-mode> of \"incl\" means that an incoming\
    \ packet is accepted\n   only if its source address is in the set specified by\
    \ <src-list>.  A\n   <filter-mode> of \"excl\" means that an incoming packet is\
    \ rejected if\n   its source address is in the set specified by <src-list>.\n\
    \   The first sub-field, <nettype>, indicates the network type, since SDP\n  \
    \ is protocol independent.  This document is most relevant to the value\n   \"\
    IN\", which designates the Internet Protocol.\n   The second sub-field, <address-types>,\
    \ identifies the address family,\n   and for the purpose of this document may\
    \ be either <addrtype> value\n   \"IP4\" or \"IP6\".  Alternately, when <dest-address>\
    \ is an FQDN, the\n   value MAY be \"*\" to apply to both address types, since\
    \ either address\n   type can be returned from a DNS lookup.\n   The third sub-field,\
    \ <dest-address>, is the destination address,\n   which MUST correspond to one\
    \ or more of the session's \"connection-\n   address\" field values.  It may be\
    \ either a unicast or multicast\n   address, an FQDN, or the \"*\" wildcard to\
    \ match any/all of the\n   session's \"connection-address\" values.\n   The fourth\
    \ sub-field, <src-list>, is the list of source\n   hosts/interfaces in the source-filter,\
    \ and consists of one or more\n   unicast addresses or FQDNs, separated by space\
    \ characters.\n   The format and content of these semantic elements are derived\
    \ from\n   and compatible with those defined in [SDP].  For more detail, see\n\
    \   Appendix A of this document.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Processing Rules
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Processing Rules\n   There are a number of details to consider when parsing\
    \ the SDP\n   source-filter syntax.\n   The <dest-address> value in a \"source-filter\"\
    \ attribute MUST\n   correspond to an existing <connection-field> value in the\
    \ session\n   description.  The only exception to this is when a \"*\" wildcard\
    \ is\n   used to indicate that the source-filter applies to all\n   <connection-field>\
    \ values.\n   When the <dest-address> value is a multicast address, the field\
    \ value\n   MUST NOT include the sub-fields <ttl> and <number of addresses> from\n\
    \   the <connection-address> value.  If the <connection-address>\n   specifies\
    \ more than one multicast address (in the <number of\n   addresses> field), then\
    \ a source filter, if any, for each such\n   address must be stated explicitly,\
    \ using a separate \"a=source-filter\"\n   line for each address (unless a \"\
    *\" wildcard is used for\n   <dest-address>).  See section 3.2.4 for an example.\n\
    \   When the <addrtype> value is the \"*\" wildcard, the <dest-address>\n   MUST\
    \ be either an FQDN or \"*\" (i.e., it MUST NOT be an IPv4 or IPv6\n   address).\
    \  See section 3.2.6 for an example.\n   As has always been the case, the default\
    \ behavior when a source-\n   filter attribute is not provided in a session description\
    \ is that all\n   traffic sent to the specified <connection-address> value should\
    \ be\n   accepted (i.e., from any source address).  The source-filter grammar\n\
    \   does not include syntax to express either \"exclude none\" or \"include\n\
    \   all.\"\n   Like the standard <connection-field> described in [SDP], the location\n\
    \   of the \"source-filter\" attribute determines whether it applies to the\n\
    \   entire session or only to a specific medium (i.e., \"session-level\" or\n\
    \   \"media-level\").  A media-level source-filter will always completely\n  \
    \ override a session-level source-filter.\n   A \"source-filter\" need not be\
    \ located at the same hierarchy level as\n   its corresponding <connection-field>.\
    \  So, a media-level\n   <source-filter> can reference a session-level <connection-field>\n\
    \   value, and a session-level \"source-filter\" can be applied to all\n   matching\
    \ media-level <connection-field> values.  See section 3.2.3\n   for an example.\n\
    \   An SDP description MUST NOT contain more than one session-level\n   \"source-filter\"\
    \ attribute that covers the same destination address,\n   or more than one media-level\
    \ \"source-filter\" attribute that covers\n   the same destination address.\n\
    \   There is no specified limit to the number of entries allowed in the\n   <src-list>;\
    \ however, there are practical limits that should be\n   considered.  For example,\
    \ depending on the transport to be used for\n   the session description, there\
    \ may be a limit to the total size of\n   the session description (e.g., as determined\
    \ by the maximum payload\n   in a single datagram).  Also, when the source-filter\
    \ is applied to\n   control protocols, there may be a limit to the number of source\n\
    \   addresses that can be sent.  These limits are outside the scope of\n   this\
    \ document, but should be considered when defining source-filter\n   values for\
    \ SDP.\n"

- title: 3.2.1.  Source-Specific Multicast Example
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Source-Specific Multicast Example\n   Multicast addresses in the Source-Specific\
    \ Multicast [SSM] range\n   require a single unicast sender address for each multicast\n\
    \   destination, so the source-filter specification provides a natural\n   fit.\
    \  In this example, a session member should receive only traffic\n   sent from\
    \ 192.0.2.10 to the multicast session address 232.3.4.5.\n      <session-description>\n\
    \      c=IN IP4 232.3.4.5/127\n      a=source-filter: incl IN IP4 232.3.4.5 192.0.2.10\n\
    \      <media-description 1>\n   This source-filter example uses an inclusion\
    \ list with a single\n   multicast \"connection-address\" as the destination and\
    \ single unicast\n   address as the source.  Note that the value of the connection-address\n\
    \   matches the value specified in the connection-field.\n   Also note that since\
    \ the connection-field is located in the session-\n   description section, the\
    \ source-filter applies to all media.\n   Furthermore, if the SDP description\
    \ specifies an RTP session (e.g.,\n   its \"m=\" line(s) specify \"RTP/AVP\" as\
    \ the transport protocol), then\n   the \"incl\" specification will apply not\
    \ only to RTP packets, but also\n   to any RTCP packets that are sent to the specified\
    \ multicast address.\n   This means that, as a side effect of the \"incl\" specification,\
    \ the\n   only possible multicast RTCP packets will be \"Sender Report\" (SR)\n\
    \   packets sent from the specified source address.\n   Because of this, an SDP\
    \ description for a Source-Specific Multicast\n   (SSM) RTP session SHOULD also\
    \ include an\n      a=rtcp-unicast ...\n   attribute, as described in [RTCP-SSM]\
    \ (section 10.1).  This specifies\n   that RTCP \"Reception Report\" (RR) packets\

- title: 4.  Interoperability Issues

  - "4.  Interoperability Issues\n   Defining a list of legitimate sources for a multicast\

    \ (ASM)\n   model, as originally described in [IGMPv1].  The ASM model supports\n\
    \   anonymous senders and all types of multicast applications (e.g.,\n   many-to-many).\

- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   See [SDP] for security considerations specific\
    \ to the Session\n   Description Protocol in general.  The central issue relevant\
    \ to using\n   source address filters is the question of address authenticity.\n\
    \   Using the source IP address for authentication is weak, since\n   addresses\
    \ are often dynamically assigned and it is possible for a\n   sender to \"spoof\"\
    \ its source address (i.e., use one other than its\n   own) in datagrams that\
    \ it sends.  Proper router configuration,\n   however, can reduce the likelihood\
    \ of \"spoofed\" source addresses\n   being sent to or from a network.  Specifically,\
    \ border routers are\n   encouraged to filter traffic so that datagrams with invalid\
    \ source\n   addresses are not forwarded (e.g., routers drop datagrams if the\n\
    \   source address is non-local) [FILTERING].  This, however, does not\n   prevent\
    \ IP source addresses from being spoofed on a Local Area\n   Network (LAN).\n\
    \   Also, as noted in section 3 above, tunneling or NAT mechanisms may\n   require\
    \ corresponding translation of the addresses specified in the\n   SDP \"source-filter\"\
    \ attribute, and furthermore, may cause a set of\n   original source addresses\
    \ to be translated to a smaller set of source\n   addresses as seen by the receiver.\n\
    \   Use of FQDNs for either <dest-address> or <src-list> values provides\n   a\
    \ layer of indirection that provides great flexibility.  However, it\n   also\
    \ exposes the source-filter to any security inadequacies that the\n   DNS system\
    \ may have.  If unsecured, it is conceivable that the DNS\n   server could return\
    \ illegitimate addresses.\n   In addition, if source-filtering is implemented\
    \ by sharing the\n   source-filter information with network elements, then the\
    \ security of\n   the protocol(s) that are used for this (e.g., [IGMPv3]) becomes\n\
    \   important, to ensure that legitimate traffic (and only legitimate\n   traffic)\
    \ is received.\n   For these reasons, receivers SHOULD NOT treat the SDP \"source-filter\"\
    \n   attribute as being its sole mechanism for protecting the integrity of\n \
    \  received content.\n"

    \ field,\n   which MAY be either a session-level or media-level attribute.\n \
