  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) suite\
    \ of\n   protocols provides, among other capabilities, support for controlling\n\
    \   different switching technologies.  These include support for\n   requesting\
    \ TDM connections utilizing SONET/SDH (see [T1.105] and\n   [G.707], respectively)\
    \ as well as Optical Transport Networks (OTNs,\n   see [G.709]).  However, there\
    \ are certain capabilities that are\n   needed to support the ITU-T G.8080 control\
    \ plane architecture for an\n   Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON).\
    \  Therefore, it is\n   desirable to understand the corresponding requirements\
    \ for the GMPLS\n   protocol suite.  The ASON control plane architecture is defined\
    \ in\n   [G.8080]; ASON routing requirements are identified in [G.7715] and in\n\
    \   [G.7715.1] for ASON link state protocols.  These Recommendations\n   apply\
    \ to all [G.805] layer networks (e.g., SDH and OTN), and provide\n   protocol-neutral\
    \ functional requirements and architecture.\n   This document focuses on the routing\
    \ requirements for the GMPLS suite\n   of protocols to support the capabilities\
    \ and functionality of ASON\n   control planes.  This document summarizes the\
    \ ASON requirements using\n   ASON terminology.  This document does not address\
    \ GMPLS applicability\n   or GMPLS capabilities.  Any protocol (in particular,\
    \ routing)\n   applicability, design, or suggested extensions are strictly outside\n\
    \   the scope of this document.  ASON (Routing) terminology sections are\n   provided\
    \ in Appendixes 1 and 2.\n   The ASON routing architecture is based on the following\
    \ assumptions:\n   -  A network is subdivided based on operator decision and criteria\n\
    \      (e.g., geography, administration, and/or technology); the network\n   \
    \   subdivisions are defined in ASON as Routing Areas (RAs).\n   -  The routing\
    \ architecture and protocols applied after the network\n      is subdivided are\
    \ an operator's choice.  A multi-level hierarchy\n      of RAs, as defined in\
    \ ITU-T [G.7715] and [G.7715.1], provides for\n      a hierarchical relationship\
    \ of RAs based on containment; i.e.,\n      child RAs are always contained within\
    \ a parent RA.  The\n      hierarchical containment relationship of RAs provides\
    \ for routing\n      information abstraction, thereby enabling scalable routing\n\
    \      information representation.  The maximum number of hierarchical RA\n  \
    \    levels to be supported is not specified (outside the scope of this\n    \
    \  document).\n   -  Within an ASON RA and for each level of the routing hierarchy,\n\
    \      multiple routing paradigms (hierarchical, step-by-step, source-\n     \
    \ based), centralized or distributed path computation, and multiple\n      different\
    \ routing protocols MAY be supported.  The architecture\n      does not assume\
    \ a one-to-one correspondence between a routing\n      protocol and an RA level,\
    \ and allows the routing protocol(s) used\n      within different RAs (including\
    \ child and parent RAs) to be\n      different.  The realization of the routing\
    \ paradigm(s) to support\n      the hierarchical levels of RAs is not specified.\n\
    \   -  The routing adjacency topology (i.e., the associated Protocol\n      Controller\
    \ (PC) connectivity) and transport topology are NOT\n      assumed to be congruent.\n\
    \   -  The requirements support architectural evolution, e.g., a change\n    \
    \  in the number of RA levels, as well as aggregation and\n      segmentation\
    \ of RAs.\n   The description of the ASON routing architecture provides for a\n\
    \   conceptual reference architecture, with definition of functional\n   components\
    \ and common information elements to enable end-to-end\n   routing in the case\
    \ of protocol heterogeneity and facilitate\n   management of ASON networks.  This\
    \ description is only conceptual: no\n   physical partitioning of these functions\
    \ is implied.\n"

- title: 3.  ASON Routing Architecture and Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  ASON Routing Architecture and Requirements\n   The fundamental architectural\
    \ concept is the RA and its related\n   functional components (see Appendix 2\
    \ on terminology).  The routing\n   services offered by an RA are provided by\
    \ a Routing Performer (RP).\n   An RP is responsible for a single RA, and it MAY\
    \ be functionally\n   realized using distributed Routing Controllers (RCs).  The\
    \ RC,\n   itself, MAY be implemented as a cluster of distributed entities (ASON\n\
    \   refers to the cluster as a Routing Control Domain (RCD)).  The RC\n   components\
    \ for an RA receive routing topology information from their\n   associated Link\
    \ Resource Manager(s) (LRMs) and store this information\n   in the Routing Information\
    \ Database (RDB).  The RDB is replicated at\n   each RC bounded to the same RA,\
    \ and MAY contain information about\n   multiple transport plane network layers.\
    \  Whenever the routing\n   topology changes, the LRM informs the corresponding\
    \ RC, which in turn\n   updates its associated RDB.  In order to ensure RDB synchronization,\n\
    \   the RCs cooperate and exchange routing information.  Path computation\n  \
    \ functions MAY exist in each RC, MAY exist on selected RCs within the\n   same\
    \ RA, or MAY be centralized for the RA.\n   In this context, communication between\
    \ RCs within the same RA is\n   realized using a particular routing protocol (or\
    \ multiple protocols).\n   In ASON, the communication component is represented\
    \ by the protocol\n   controller (PC) component(s) and the protocol messages are\
    \ conveyed\n   over the ASON control plane's Signaling Control Network (SCN).\
    \  The\n   PC MAY convey information for one or more transport network layers\n\
    \   (refer to the note in Section 3.2).  The RC is protocol independent,\n   and\
    \ RC communications MAY be realized by multiple, different PCs\n   within an RA.\n\
    \   The ASON routing architecture defines a multi-level routing hierarchy\n  \
    \ of RAs based on a containment model to support routing information\n   abstraction.\
    \  [G.7715.1] defines the ASON hierarchical link state\n   routing protocol requirements\
    \ for communication of routing\n   information within an RA (one level) to support\
    \ hierarchical routing\n   information dissemination (including summarized routing\
    \ information\n   for other levels).  The communication between any of the other\n\
    \   functional component(s) (e.g., SCN, LRM, and between RCDs (RC-RC\n   communication\
    \ between RAs)) is outside the scope of [G.7715.1]\n   protocol requirements and,\
    \ thus, is also outside the scope of this\n   document.\n   ASON routing components\
    \ are identified by identifiers that are drawn\n   from different name spaces\
    \ (see [G.7715.1]).  These are control plane\n   identifiers for transport resources,\
    \ components, and SCN addresses.\n   The formats of those identifiers in a routing\
    \ protocol realization\n   SHALL be implementation specific and outside the scope\
    \ of this\n   document.\n   The failure of an RC, or the failure of communications\
    \ between RCs,\n   and the subsequent recovery from the failure condition MUST\
    \ NOT\n   disrupt calls in progress (i.e., already established) and their\n  \
    \ associated connections.  Calls being set up MAY fail to complete, and\n   the\
    \ call setup service MAY be unavailable during recovery actions.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Multiple Hierarchical Levels of ASON Routing Areas (RAs)
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Multiple Hierarchical Levels of ASON Routing Areas (RAs)\n   [G.8080] introduces\
    \ the concept of a Routing Area (RA) in reference\n   to a network subdivision.\
    \  RAs provide for routing information\n   abstraction.  Except for the single\
    \ RA case, RAs are hierarchically\n   contained: a higher-level (parent) RA contains\
    \ lower-level (child)\n   RAs that in turn MAY also contain RAs, etc.  Thus, RAs\
    \ contain RAs\n   that recursively define successive hierarchical RA levels.\n\
    \   However, the RA containment relationship describes only an\n   architectural\
    \ hierarchical organization of RAs.  It does not restrict\n   a specific routing\
    \ protocol's realization (e.g., OSPF multi-areas,\n   path computation, etc.).\
    \  Moreover, the realization of the routing\n   paradigm to support a hierarchical\
    \ organization of RAs and the number\n   of hierarchical RA levels to be supported\
    \ is routing protocol\n   specific and outside the scope of this document.\n \
    \  In a multi-level hierarchy of RAs, it is necessary to distinguish\n   among\
    \ RCs for the different levels of the RA hierarchy.  Before any\n   pair of RCs\
    \ establishes communication, they MUST verify that they are\n   bound to the same\
    \ parent RA (see Section 3.2).  An RA identifier (RA\n   ID) is required to provide\
    \ the scope within which the RCs can\n   communicate.  To distinguish between\
    \ RCs bound to the same RA, an RC\n   identifier (RC ID) is required; the RC ID\
    \ MUST be unique within its\n   containing RA.\n   An RA represents a partition\
    \ of the data plane, and its identifier\n   (i.e., RA ID) is used within the control\
    \ plane as a reference to the\n   data plane partition.  Each RA within a carrier's\
    \ network SHALL be\n   uniquely identifiable.  RA IDs MAY be associated with a\
    \ transport\n   plane name space, whereas RC IDs are associated with a control\
    \ plane\n   name space.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Hierarchical Routing Information Dissemination
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Hierarchical Routing Information Dissemination\n   Routing information\
    \ can be exchanged between RCs bound to adjacent\n   levels of the RA hierarchy,\
    \ i.e., Level N+1 and N, where Level N\n   represents the RAs contained by Level\
    \ N+1.  The links connecting RAs\n   may be viewed as external links (inter-RA\
    \ links), and the links\n   representing connectivity within an RA may be viewed\
    \ as internal\n   links (intra-RA links).  The external links to an RA at one\
    \ level of\n   the hierarchy may be internal links in the parent RA.  Intra-RA\
    \ links\n   of a child RA MAY be hidden from the parent RA's view.\n   The physical\
    \ location of RCs for adjacent RA levels, their\n   relationship, and their communication\
    \ protocol(s) are outside the\n   scope of this document.  No assumption is made\
    \ regarding how RCs\n   communicate between adjacent RA levels.  If routing information\
    \ is\n   exchanged between an RC, its parent, and its child RCs, it SHOULD\n \
    \  include reachability (see Section 3.5.3) and MAY include, upon policy\n   decision,\
    \ node and link topology.  Communication between RAs only\n   takes place between\
    \ RCs with a parent/child relationship.  RCs of one\n   RA never communicate with\
    \ RCs of another RA at the same level.  There\n   SHOULD not be any dependencies\
    \ on the different routing protocols\n   used within an RA or in different RAs.\n\
    \   Multiple RCs bound to the same RA MAY transform (filter, summarize,\n   etc.)\
    \ and then forward information to RCs at different levels.\n   However, in this\
    \ case, the resulting information at the receiving\n   level must be self-consistent\
    \ (i.e., ensure consistency between\n   transform operations performed on routing\
    \ information at different\n   levels to ensure proper information processing).\
    \  This MAY be\n   achieved using a number of mechanisms.\n   Note: There is no\
    \ implied relationship between multi-layer transport\n   networks and multi-level\
    \ routing.  Implementations MAY support a\n   hierarchical routing topology (multi-level)\
    \ with a single routing\n   protocol instance for multiple transport switching\
    \ layers or a\n   hierarchical routing topology for one transport switching layer.\n\
    \   1. Type of Information Exchanged\n      The type of information flowing upward\
    \ (i.e., Level N to Level\n      N+1) and the information flowing downward (i.e.,\
    \ Level N+1 to\n      Level N) are used for similar purposes, namely, the exchange\
    \ of\n      reachability information and summarized topology information to\n\
    \      allow routing across multiple RAs.  The summarization of topology\n   \
    \   information may impact the accuracy of routing and may require\n      additional\
    \ path calculation.\n      The following information exchanges are expected:\n\
    \      -  Level N+1 visibility to Level N reachability and topology (or\n    \
    \     upward information communication) allowing RC(s) at Level N+1\n        \
    \ to determine the reachable endpoints from Level N.\n      -  Level N visibility\
    \ to Level N+1 reachability and topology (or\n         downward information communication)\
    \ allowing RC(s) bounded to\n         an RA at Level N to develop paths to reachable\
    \ endpoints\n         outside of the RA.\n   2. Interactions between Upward and\
    \ Downward Communication\n      When both upward and downward information exchanges\
    \ contain\n      endpoint reachability information, a feedback loop could\n  \
    \    potentially be created.  Consequently, the routing protocol MUST\n      include\
    \ a method to:\n      -  prevent information propagated from a Level N+1 RA's\
    \ RC into\n         the Level N RA's RC from being re-introduced into the Level\
    \ N+1\n         RA's RC, and\n      -  prevent information propagated from a Level\
    \ N-1 RA's RC into\n         the Level N RA's RC from being re-introduced into\
    \ the Level N-1\n         RA's RC.\n      The routing protocol SHALL differentiate\
    \ the routing information\n      originated at a given-level RA from derived routing\
    \ information\n      (received from external RAs), even when this information\
    \ is\n      forwarded by another RC at the same level.  This is a necessary\n\
    \      condition to be fulfilled by routing protocols to be loop free.\n   3.\
    \ Method of Communication\n      Two approaches exist for communication between\
    \ Level N and N+1:\n      -  The first approach places an instance of a Level\
    \ N routing\n         function and an instance of a Level N+1 routing function\
    \ in the\n         same system.  The communications interface is within a single\n\
    \         system and is thus not an open interface subject to\n         standardization.\
    \  However, information re-advertisement or\n         leaking MUST be performed\
    \ in a consistent manner to ensure\n         interoperability and basic routing\
    \ protocol correctness (e.g.,\n         cost/metric value).\n      -  The second\
    \ approach places the Level N routing function on a\n         separate system\
    \ from the Level N+1 routing function.  In this\n         case, a communication\
    \ interface must be used between the\n         systems containing the routing\
    \ functions for different levels.\n         This communication interface and mechanisms\
    \ are outside the\n         scope of this document.\n"

    \   in ITU-T Recommendation [M.3016]) of confidentiality, integrity, and\n   accountability\
    \ may take on varying levels of importance.  These\n   objectives do not necessarily\
    \ imply requirements on the routing\n   protocol itself, and MAY be met by other\
    \ established means.\n   Note: A threat analysis of a proposed routing protocol\
    \ SHOULD address\n   masquerade, eavesdropping, unauthorized access, loss or corruption\
    \ of\n   information (including replay attacks), repudiation, forgery, and\n \
    \  denial of service attacks.\n"
- title: 5.  Conclusions
  contents:
  - "5.  Conclusions\n   The description of the ASON routing architecture and components\
    \ is\n   provided in terms of routing functionality.  This description is only\n\
    \   conceptual: no physical partitioning of these functions is implied.\n   In\
    \ summary, the ASON routing architecture assumes:\n   -  A network is subdivided\
    \ into ASON RAs, which MAY support multiple\n      routing protocols; no one-to-one\
    \ relationship SHALL be assumed.\n   -  Routing Controllers (RCs) provide for\
    \ the exchange of routing\n      information (primitives) for the RA.  The RC\
    \ is protocol\n      independent and MAY be realized by multiple, different protocol\n\
    \      controllers within an RA.  The routing information exchanged\n      between\
    \ RCs SHALL be subject to policy constraints imposed at\n      reference points\
    \ (External- and Internal-NNI).\n   -  In a multi-level RA hierarchy based on\
    \ containment, communication\n      between RCs of different RAs happens only\
    \ when there is a\n      parent/child relationship between the RAs.  RCs of child\
    \ RAs never\n      communicate with the RCs of other child RAs.  There SHOULD\
    \ not be\n      any dependencies on the different routing protocols used within\
    \ a\n      child RA and that of its parent.  The routing information\n      exchanged\
    \ within the parent RA SHALL be independent of both the\n      routing protocol\
    \ operating within a child RA and any control\n      distribution choice(s), e.g.,\
    \ centralized, fully distributed.\n   -  For an RA, the set of RCs is referred\
    \ to as an ASON routing\n      (control) domain.  The routing information exchanged\
    \ between\n      routing domains (inter-RA, i.e., inter-domain) SHALL be\n   \
    \   independent of both the intra-domain routing protocol(s) and the\n      intra-domain\
    \ control distribution choice(s), e.g., centralized,\n      fully distributed.\
    \  RCs bounded to different RA levels MAY be\n      collocated within the same\
    \ physical element or physically\n      distributed.\n   -  The routing adjacency\
    \ topology (i.e., the associated PC\n      connectivity topology) and the transport\
    \ network topology SHALL\n      NOT be assumed to be congruent.\n   -  The routing\
    \ topology SHALL support multiple links between nodes\n      and RAs.\n   In summary,\
    \ the following functionality is expected from GMPLS\n   routing to instantiate\
    \ the ASON hierarchical routing architecture\n   realization (see [G.7715] and\
    \ [G.7715.1]):\n   -  RAs SHALL be uniquely identifiable within a carrier's network,\n\
    \      each having a unique RA ID within the carrier's network.\n   -  Within\
    \ an RA (one level), the routing protocol SHALL support\n      dissemination of\
    \ hierarchical routing information (including\n      summarized routing information\
    \ for other levels) in support of an\n      architecture of multiple hierarchical\
    \ levels of RAs; the number of\n      hierarchical RA levels to be supported by\
    \ a routing protocol is\n      implementation specific.\n   -  The routing protocol\
    \ SHALL support routing information based on a\n      common set of information\
    \ elements as defined in [G.7715] and\n      [G.7715.1], divided between attributes\
    \ pertaining to links and\n      abstract nodes (each representing either a subnetwork\
    \ or simply a\n      node).  [G.7715] recognizes that the manner in which the\
    \ routing\n      information is represented and exchanged will vary with the\n\
    \      routing protocol used.\n   -  The routing protocol SHALL converge such\
    \ that the distributed RDBs\n      become synchronized after a period of time.\n\
    \   To support hierarchical routing information dissemination within an\n   RA,\
    \ the routing protocol MUST deliver:\n   -  Processing of routing information\
    \ exchanged between adjacent\n      levels of the hierarchy (i.e., Level N+1 and\
    \ N) including\n      reachability and, upon policy, decision summarized topology\n\
    \      information.\n   -  Self-consistent information at the receiving level\
    \ resulting from\n      any transformation (filter, summarize, etc.) and forwarding\
    \ of\n      information from one RC to RC(s) at different levels when multiple\n\
    \      RCs are bound to a single RA.\n   -  A mechanism to prevent the re-introduction\
    \ of information\n      propagated into the Level N RA's RC back to the adjacent\
    \ level\n      RA's RC from which this information has been initially received.\n\
    \   In order to support operator-assisted changes in the containment\n   relationships\
    \ of RAs, the routing protocol SHALL support evolution in\n   terms of the number\
    \ of hierarchical levels of RAs.  For example:\n   support of non-disruptive operations\
    \ such as adding and removing RAs\n   at the top/bottom of the hierarchy, adding\
    \ or removing a hierarchical\n   level of RAs in or from the middle of the hierarchy,\
    \ as well as\n   aggregation and segmentation of RAs.  The number of hierarchical\n\
    \   levels to be supported is routing protocol specific and reflects a\n   containment\
    \ relationship; e.g., an RA insertion involves supporting a\n   different routing\
    \ protocol domain in a portion of the network.\n   Reachability information (see\
    \ Section 3.5.3) of the set of endpoints\n   reachable by a node may be advertised\
    \ either as a set of UNI\n   Transport Resource addresses/address prefixes or\
    \ a set of associated\n   SNPP link IDs/SNPP link ID prefixes, assigned and selected\n\
    \   consistently in their applicability scope.  The formats of the\n   control\
    \ plane identifiers in a protocol realization are\n   implementation specific.\
    \  Use of a routing protocol within an RA\n   should not restrict the choice of\
    \ routing protocols for use in other\n   RAs (child or parent).\n   As ASON does\
    \ not restrict the control plane architecture choice used,\n   either a collocated\
    \ architecture or a physically separated\n   architecture may be used.  A collection\
    \ of links and nodes such as a\n   subnetwork or RA MUST be able to represent\
    \ itself to the wider\n   network as a single logical entity with only its external\
    \ links\n   visible to the topology database.\n"

  - "Appendix 1: ASON Terminology\n   This document makes use of the following terms:\n\
    \   Administrative domain (see Recommendation [G.805]): For the purposes\n   of\
    \ [G.7715.1], an administrative domain represents the extent of\n   resources\
    \ that belong to a single player such as a network operator,\n   a service provider,\
    \ or an end-user.  Administrative domains of\n   different players do not overlap\
    \ amongst themselves.\n   Adaptation function (see Recommendation [G.805]): A\
    \ \"transport\n   processing function\" that processes the client layer information\
    \ for\n   transfer over a server layer trail.\n   Client/Server relationship:\
    \ The association between layer networks\n   that is performed by an \"adaptation\"\
    \ function to allow the link\n   connection in the client layer network to be\
    \ supported by a trail in\n   the server layer network.\n   Control plane: Performs\
    \ the call control and connection control\n   functions.  Through signaling, the\
    \ control plane sets up and releases\n   connections and may restore a connection\
    \ in case of a failure.\n   (Control) Domain: Represents a collection of (control)\
    \ entities that\n   are grouped for a particular purpose.  The control plane is\n\
    \   subdivided into domains matching administrative domains.  Within an\n   administrative\
    \ domain, further subdivisions of the control plane are\n   recursively applied.\
    \  A routing control domain is an abstract entity\n   that hides the details of\
    \ the RC distribution.\n   External NNI (E-NNI): Interfaces are located between\
    \ protocol\n   controllers between control domains.\n   Internal NNI (I-NNI):\
    \ Interfaces are located between protocol\n   controllers within control domains.\n\
    \   Link (see Recommendation [G.805]): A \"topological component\" that\n   describes\
    \ a fixed relationship between a \"subnetwork\" or \"access\n   group\" and another\
    \ \"subnetwork\" or \"access group\".  Links are not\n   limited to being provided\
    \ by a single server trail.\n   Management plane: Performs management functions\
    \ for the transport\n   plane, the control plane, and the system as a whole. \
    \ It also\n   provides coordination between all the planes.  The following\n \
    \  management functional areas are performed in the management plane:\n   performance,\
    \ fault, configuration, accounting, and security\n   management.\n   Management\
    \ domain (see Recommendation [G.805]): A management domain\n   defines a collection\
    \ of managed objects that are grouped to meet\n   organizational requirements\
    \ according to geography, technology,\n   policy, or other structure, and for\
    \ a number of functional areas such\n   as configuration, security, (FCAPS), for\
    \ the purpose of providing\n   control in a consistent manner.  Management domains\
    \ can be disjoint,\n   contained, or overlapping.  As such, the resources within\
    \ an\n   administrative domain can be distributed into several possible\n   overlapping\
    \ management domains.  The same resource can therefore\n   belong to several management\
    \ domains simultaneously, but a management\n   domain shall not cross the border\
    \ of an administrative domain.\n   Multiplexing (see Recommendation [G.805]):\
    \ Multiplexing techniques\n   are used to combine client layer signals.  The many-to-one\n\
    \   relationship represents the case of several link connections of\n   client\
    \ layer networks supported by one server layer trail at the same\n   time.\n \
    \  Subnetwork Point (SNP): The SNP is a control plane abstraction that\n   represents\
    \ an actual or potential transport plane resource.  SNPs (in\n   different subnetwork\
    \ partitions) may represent the same transport\n   resource.  A one-to-one correspondence\
    \ should not be assumed.\n   Subnetwork Point Pool (SNPP): A set of SNPs that\
    \ are grouped together\n   for the purposes of routing.\n   Termination Connection\
    \ Point (TCP): A TCP represents the output of a\n   Trail Termination function\
    \ or the input to a Trail Termination Sink\n   function.\n   Trail (see Recommendation\
    \ [G.805]): A \"transport entity\" that\n   consists of an associated pair of\
    \ \"unidirectional trails\" capable of\n   simultaneously transferring information\
    \ in opposite directions\n   between their respective inputs and outputs.\n  \
    \ Transport plane: Provides bi-directional or unidirectional transfer\n   of user\
    \ information, from one location to another.  It can also\n   provide transfer\
    \ of some control and network management information.\n   The transport plane\
    \ is layered; it is equivalent to the Transport\n   Network defined in the [G.805]\
    \ Recommendation.\n   User Network Interface (UNI): Interfaces are located between\
    \ protocol\n   controllers between a user and a control domain.  Note: there is\
    \ no\n   routing function associated with a UNI reference point.\n   Variable\
    \ adaptation function: A single server layer trail may\n   dynamically support\
    \ different multiplexing structures, i.e., link\n   connections for multiple client\
    \ layer networks.\n"
- title: 'Appendix 2: ASON Routing Terminology'
  contents:
  - "Appendix 2: ASON Routing Terminology\n   This document makes use of the following\
    \ terms:\n   Routing Area (RA): An RA represents a partition of the data plane,\n\
    \   and its identifier is used within the control plane as the\n   representation\
    \ of this partition.  Per [G.8080], an RA is defined by\n   a set of subnetworks,\
    \ the links that interconnect them, and the\n   interfaces representing the ends\
    \ of the links exiting that RA.  An RA\n   may contain smaller RAs inter-connected\
    \ by links.  The limit of\n   subdivision results in an RA that contains two subnetworks\n\
    \   interconnected by a single link.\n   Routing Database (RDB): Repository for\
    \ the local topology, network\n   topology, reachability, and other routing information\
    \ that is updated\n   as part of the routing information exchange and may additionally\n\
    \   contain information that is configured.  The RDB may contain routing\n   information\
    \ for more than one Routing Area (RA).\n   Routing Components: ASON routing architecture\
    \ functions.  These\n   functions can be classified as protocol independent (Link\
    \ Resource\n   Manager or LRM, Routing Controller or RC) and protocol specific\n\
    \   (Protocol Controller or PC).\n   Routing Controller (RC): Handles (abstract)\
    \ information needed for\n   routing and the routing information exchange with\
    \ peering RCs by\n   operating on the RDB.  The RC has access to a view of the\
    \ RDB.  The\n   RC is protocol independent.\n   Note: Since the RDB may contain\
    \ routing information pertaining to\n   multiple RAs (and possibly to multiple\
    \ layer networks), the RCs\n   accessing the RDB may share the routing information.\n\
    \   Link Resource Manager (LRM): Supplies all the relevant component and\n   Traffic\
    \ Engineering (TE) link information to the RC.  It informs the\n   RC about any\
    \ state changes of the link resources it controls.\n   Protocol Controller (PC):\
    \ Handles protocol-specific message exchanges\n   according to the reference point\
    \ over which the information is\n   exchanged (e.g., E-NNI, I-NNI), and internal\
    \ exchanges with the RC.\n   The PC function is protocol dependent.\n"
