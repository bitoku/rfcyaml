  - "INTRODUCTION\n    The ARPANET Official Network Host Table, as outlined in RFC\
    \ 608, no\n   longer suits the needs of the DoD community, nor does it follow\
    \ a\n   format suitable for internetting.  This paper specifies a new host\n \
    \  table format applicable to both ARPANET and Internet needs.\n   In addition\
    \ to host name to host address translation and selected\n   protocol information,\
    \ we have also included network and gateway name\n   to address correspondence,\
    \ and host operating system information.\n   This Host Table is utilized by the\
    \ DoD Host Name Server maintained by\n   the ARPANET Network Information Center\
    \ (NIC) on behalf of the Defense\n   Communications Agency (DCA) (RFC 811).  It\
    \ obsoletes the host table\n   described in RFC 608.\n"
- title: LOCATION OF THE STANDARD DoD ONLINE HOST TABLE
  contents:
  - "LOCATION OF THE STANDARD DoD ONLINE HOST TABLE\n   A machine-translatable ASCII\
    \ text version of the new DoD Host Table\n   is online in the file <NETINFO>HOSTS.TXT\
    \ on the SRI-NIC host.  It can\n   be obtained by connecting to host SRI-NIC (10.0.0.73)\
    \ from your local\n   FTP server, logging in as user=ANONYMOUS, password=GUEST,\
    \ and doing a\n   'get' on <NETINFO>HOSTS.TXT.  The same table may also be obtained\
    \ via\n   the NIC Host Name Server.\n   NOTE:  See Appendix A. for timeframe for\
    \ cutover.\n"
- title: ASSUMPTIONS
  contents:
  - "ASSUMPTIONS\n   1. A \"name\" (Net, Host, Gateway, or Domain name) is a text\
    \ string up\n   to 24 characters drawn from the alphabet (A-Z), digits (0-9),\
    \ and the\n   minus sign (-) and period (.).  No blank or space characters are\n\
    \   permitted as part of a name.  No distinction is made between upper\n   and\
    \ lower case.  The first character must be a letter.  The last\n   character must\
    \ not be a minus sign or period.  A host which serves as\n   a GATEWAY should\
    \ have \"-GATEWAY\" or \"-GW\" as part of its name.  A\n   host which is a TIP\
    \ or a TAC should have  \"-TIP\" or \"-TAC\" as part of\n   its host name, if\
    \ it is an ARPANET or DoD host.\n   2. Internet Addresses are 32-bit addresses\
    \ (RFC 796).  In the host\n   table described herein each address is represented\
    \ by four decimal\n   numbers separated by a period.  Each decimal number represents\
    \ 1\n                                                Host Table Specification\n\
    \   3. If the first bit of the first octet of the address is 0 (zero),\n   then\
    \ the next 7 bits of the first octet indicate the network number\n   (Class A\
    \ Address).  If the first two bits are 1,0 (one,zero), then\n   the next 14 bits\
    \ define the net number (Class B Address).  If the\n   first 3 bits are 1,1,0\
    \ (one,one,zero), then the next 21 bits define\n   the net number (Class C Address)\
    \ (RFC 796).\n   This is depicted in the following diagram:\n   +--------------+-----------------------------------------------+\n\
    \   |0|  NET <-7-> |      LOCAL ADDRESS  <-24->                    |\n   +--------------+-----------------------------------------------+\n\
    \   +---+--------------------------+-------------------------------+\n   |1 0|\
    \       NET  <-14->        |  LOCAL ADDRESS  <-16->        |\n   +---+--------------------------+-------------------------------+\n\
    \   +-----+----------------------------------------+---------------+\n   |1 1\
    \ 0|           NET  <-21->                  | LOCAL ADDRESS |\n   +-----+----------------------------------------+---------------+\n\
    \   4. The LOCAL ADDRESS portion of the internet address identifies a\n   host\
    \ within the network specified by the NET portion of the address.\n   5. For the\
    \ ARPANET (a Class A network), the NET address is 10\n   (decimal) and the LOCAL\
    \ ADDRESS maps as follows: the second octet\n   defines the physical host, the\
    \ third octet defines the logical host,\n   and the fourth defines the IMP.\n\
    \   +-+-------------+---------------+--------------+---------------+\n   |0| \
    \    10      |    HOST       | LOGICAL HOST |      IMP      |\n   +-+-------------+---------------+--------------+---------------+\n\
    \   (NOTE:  RFC 796 describes the local address mappings for several\n   other\
    \ networks.)\n   6.  It is the responsibility of the user using this host table\
    \ to\n   translate it into whatever format is needed for his or her purposes.\n\
    \   7. Names and Addresses for DoD networks, gateways, and hosts will be\n   negotiated\
    \ and registered with the Network Information Center\n   (NIC@SRI-NIC or (415)\
    \ 859-4775) before being used and before traffic\n   is passed by a DoD host.\
    \  For an interim period the NIC will attempt\n   to keep similar information\
    \ for non-DoD networks and hosts if this\n   information is provided, and as long\
    \ as it is needed, i.e., until\n   intercommunicating network name servers are\
    \ in place.\n"
