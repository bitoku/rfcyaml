- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The EPCglobal Architecture Framework [6] is a set of specifications\n\
    \   for reading, managing, and acting on object codes and other sensor\n   data\
    \ as physical objects pass through a supply chain.  Events and\n   metadata about\
    \ physical objects are exchanged via EPCglobal\n   Electronic Product Code Information\
    \ Services (EPCIS) that are\n   essentially web services that implement agreed\
    \ upon schema and\n   interfaces.\n   Each object that is tracked by the EPCglobal\
    \ Architecture Framework\n   is identified by one or more managed identifiers.\
    \  In many cases,\n   these identification systems existed prior to the Internet\
    \ becoming\n   widely used.  One such namespace is the Global Trade Item Number,\
    \ or\n   GTIN [7].  GTINs are widely used in global commerce and are managed\n\
    \   by GS1.  In order for the EPCglobal Architecture Framework to\n   leverage\
    \ the Internet to the fullest extent possible, the GTIN\n   namespace (and others,\
    \ such as Global Location Numbers (GLNs),\n   Serialized Shipping Container Code\
    \ (SSCC), etc. [7]) need to be\n   directly compatible with the URI family of\
    \ identifiers.\n   The use of GTINs, GLNs, and SSCCs are all managed by GS1. \
    \ Their use\n   within the EPCglobal Architecture Framework is managed by the\
    \ GS1\n   subsidiary known as EPCglobal, Inc.  For these, and possibly future\n\
    \   identification systems, a single Uniform Resource Name (URN)\n   Namespace\
    \ ID (NID) is being requested: 'epc'.  Each of the identifier\n   namespaces mentioned\
    \ will have a separate sub-space beneath the top\n   level 'epc' NID.\n   In addition\
    \ to physical object identifiers, the EPCglobal\n   Architecture Framework requires\
    \ new namespaces for naming system\n   components.  In many cases, an interface\
    \ within the EPCglobal\n   Architecture Framework is XML [11] based and as such\
    \ will require\n   naming schemes for its XML schema [9] and various namespaces\
    \ [10].\n   For these uses, another Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace ID\n\
    \   (NID) is being requested: 'epcglobal'.  Each specification or system\n   component\
    \ within the EPCglobal Architecture Framework will have a\n   separate sub-space\
    \ beneath the top level 'epcglobal' NID.\n   Since the EPCglobal Architecture\
    \ Framework is engineered for\n   widespread and general use, this namespace specification\
    \ is a formal\n   one, and the namespace IDs that are being requested are 'epc'\
    \ and\n   'epcglobal'.  It is important to note that it is the explicit intent\n\
    \   that various sub-namespaces of the 'epc' NID actually name real,\n   physical\
    \ objects and/or corporeal entities.  In contrast, sub-\n   namespaces of the\
    \ 'epcglobal' NID name logical or software\n   constructs, such as schema namespaces.\n"

    \ of structure:\n         The normative specification of the structure of the\
    \ 'epc'\n         namespace is \"EPC Tag Data Standards\" [5].  The examples given\n\
    \         below are not normative.\n         The 'epc' namespace is a set of sub-namespaces\
    \ that can be\n         extended in the future.  The following ABNF [2] defines\
    \ how the\n         sub-namespaces are identified and any restrictions on their\n\
    \         syntax (definitions not specified below can be found in RFC\n      \
    \   2141 [1]):\n   EPC-URN     = \"urn:epc:\" sub-ns-name \":\" sub-ns\n   sub-ns-name\
    \ = let-num [ 1*let-num-hyp ]\n   sub-ns      = 1*<URN chars>\n   let-num    \
    \ = upper / lower / number\n   let-num-hyp = upper / lower / number / \"-\"\n\
    \   upper       = %x41-5A ; \"A\" - \"Z\"\n   lower       = %x61-7A ; \"a\" -\
    \ \"z\"\n   number      = \"0\" / \"1\" / \"2\" / \"3\" / \"4\" / \"5\" / \"6\"\
    \ / \"7\" /\n                 \"8\" / \"9\"\n         For example, the sub-namespace\
    \ 'sgtin' has the following\n         definition (this ABNF is non-normative):\n\
    \   SGTIN-URI        = \"urn:epc:id:sgtin:\" SGTINURIBody\n   SGTINURIBody   \
    \  = 2*(PaddedNumericComponent \".\") NumericComponent\n   NumericComponent =\
    \ ZeroComponent / NonZeroComponent\n   ZeroComponent    = \"0\"\n   NonZeroComponent\
    \ = NonZeroDigit *Digit\n   PaddedNumericComponent = *Digit\n   Digit = \"0\"\
    \ / NonZeroDigit\n   NonZeroDigit = \"1\" / \"2\" / \"3\" / \"4\" / \"5\" / \"\
    6\" / \"7\" / \"8\" / \"9\"\n   This equates to a namespace that has three period\
    \ separated series of\n   digits:\n                        urn:epc:id:sgtin:900100.0003456.1234567\n\
    \   The first series is a company prefix, the second denotes a product\n   reference\
    \ assigned by that company, and the third is a serial number\n   for a specific\
    \ instance of their product.  Note that leading zeros\n   are significant.\n \
    \  Relevant ancillary documentation:\n         The standards that define the EPCglobal\
    \ Architecture Framework\n         and the processes for creating new sub-namespaces\
    \ are managed\n         by EPCglobal, Inc. and can be found on its website.  Several\n\
    \         sub-namespaces are defined in the \"EPC Tag Data Standards\" [5].\n\
    \   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n         The namespaces that make up\
    \ the 'epc' namespace are all managed\n         by an organization with almost\
    \ 50 years of namespace management\n         experience.  In all cases (existing\
    \ or new), the uniqueness of\n         each namespace is an inherent part of the\
    \ EPCglobal\n         Architecture Framework.\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n\
    \         The assignment process guarantees that names are not reassigned\n  \
    \       and that the binding between the name and its resource is\n         permanent,\
    \ regardless of any standards or organizational\n         changes.\n   Process\
    \ of identifier assignment:\n         Names are assigned by the EPCglobal standards\
    \ publication\n         process and by any entities that are sub-delegated by\n\
    \         EPCglobal.  It is important to note that in many cases the\n       \
    \  names assigned will explicitly denote physical objects and not\n         an\
    \ electronic representation of that object.\n   Process of identifier resolution:\n\
    \         Certain sub-namespaces are resolved via the Object Naming\n        \
    \ Service, defined in \"Object Naming Service (ONS) Version 1.0\"\n         [4],\
    \ which is a valid implementation of the Dynamic Delegation\n         Discovery\
    \ System that is defined in RFC 3401 [3].\n   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n\
    \         The entire URN is case-sensitive.\n   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n\
    \         There are no additional characters reserved except as noted in\n   \
    \      the ABNF above.\n   Validation mechanism:\n         In the case of each\
    \ sub-namespace, there will be namespace-\n         specific rules for determining\
    \ validity.  In each case, the\n         reader is referred to the appropriate\

    \ and\n   threats.  The primary threats will come from the fact that these\n \
    \  names will identify physical things that can be of high value, thus\n   the\
    \ temptation to spoof metadata about that identifier (its cost,\n   size, etc)\
    \ will be much greater.  Therefore, the role of digital\n   signatures, secure\
