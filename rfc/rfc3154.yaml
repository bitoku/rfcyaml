- title: 1.   Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.   Introduction\n   In [1], a problem statement was developed to explain why\
    \ an IP\n   protocol was desirable for alerting hosts in dormant mode, commonly\n\
    \   called paging.  In this document, a set of requirements is developed\n   for\
    \ guiding the development of an IP paging protocol.  Based on the\n   requirements,\
    \ an architecture is developed to represent the\n   functional relationships between\
    \ logical functional entities\n   involved.\n"
- title: 2.   Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.   Terminology\n   Please see [1] for definition of terms used in describing\
    \ paging.  In\n   addition, this document defines the following terms:\n     \
    \ Wide Casting - Either broadcasting or multicasting.\n         Inactive Mode\
    \ - The host is no longer listening for any\n         packets, not even periodically,\
    \ and not sending packets.  The\n         host may be in a powered off state,\
    \ it may have shut down all\n         interfaces to drastically conserve power,\
    \ or it may be out of\n         range of a radio access point.\n"
- title: 3.   Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.   Security Considerations\n   An IP paging protocol introduces new security\
    \ issues.  In this\n   section, security issues with relevance to formulating\
    \ requirements\n   for an IP paging protocol are discussed.\n"
- title: 3.1. DoS Amplification
  contents:
  - "3.1. DoS Amplification\n   A DoS (Denial-of-Service) or DDoS (Distributed DoS)\
    \ attack generally\n   consists of flooding a target network with bogus IP packets\
    \ in order\n   to cause degraded network performance at victim nodes and/or routers.\n\
    \   Performance can be degraded to the point that the network cannot be\n   used.\
    \  Currently, there is no preventive solution against these\n   attacks, and the\
    \ impacts can be very important.\n   In general a DoS attacker profits from a\
    \ so-called \"amplifier\" in\n   order to increase the damage caused by his attack.\
    \  Paging can serve\n   for an attacker as a DoS amplifier.\n   An attacker (a\
    \ malicious correspondent node) can send large numbers\n   of packets pretending\
    \ to be sent from different (bogus) correspondent\n   nodes and destined for large\
    \ numbers of hosts in inactive and dormant\n   modes.  This attack, in turn, will\
    \ be amplified by the paging agent\n   which wide casts paging messages over a\
    \ paging area, resulting in\n   more than one networks being flooded.  Clearly,\
    \ the damage can be\n   more important in wireless networks that already suffer\
    \ from scarce\n   radio bandwidth.\n   Alternatively, an attacker can sort out\
    \ a host which:\n      1. sends periodic messages declaring that it is in dormant\
    \ mode,\n      2. never replies to paging requests.\n   Such a node may be the\
    \ attacker's node itself, or a second node\n   participating in the attack.\n\
    \   That node is never in inactive mode because of behavior 1 above.  In\n   this\
    \ case, the attacker can send large numbers of packets destined\n   for that host\
    \ which periodically declares that it is in dormant mode\n   but never replies\
    \ to paging messages.  The impact will be the same as\n   above however in this\
    \ case the attack will be amplified indefinitely.\n"
- title: 3.2. Queue Overflow
  contents:
  - "3.2. Queue Overflow\n   For reliability reasons, the paging protocol may need\
    \ to make\n   provisions for a paging queue where a paging request is buffered\n\
    \   until the requested host replies by sending a location registration\n   message.\n\
    \   An attacker can exploit that by sending large numbers of packets\n   having\
    \ different (bogus) correspondent node addresses and destined\n   for one or more\
    \ inactive hosts.  These packets will be buffered in\n   the paging queue.  However,\
    \ since the hosts are inactive, the paging\n   queue may quickly overflow, blocking\
    \ the incoming traffic from\n   legitimate correspondent nodes.  As a result,\
    \ all registered dormant\n   hosts may be inaccessible for a while.  The attacker\
    \ can re-launch\n   the attack in a continuous fashion.\n   An attacker together\
    \ with a bogus host that fails to respond to pages\n   can overflow the buffering\
    \ provided to hold packets for dormant mode\n   hosts.  If the attacker keeps\
    \ sending packets while the dormant mode\n   host fails to reply, the buffer can\
    \ overflow.\n"
- title: 3.3. Selective DoS against Hosts
  contents:
  - "3.3. Selective DoS against Hosts\n   The following vulnerabilities already exist\
    \ in the absence of IP\n   paging.  However, they are included here since they\
    \ can affect the\n   correct operation of the IP paging protocol.\n   These vulnerabilities\
    \ can be exploited by an attacker in order to\n   eliminate a particular host.\
    \  This, in turn, can be used by an\n   attacker as a stepping stone to launch\
    \ other attacks.\n   Forced Battery Consumption\n   An attacker can frequently\
    \ send packets to a host in order to prevent\n   that host from switching to dormant\
    \ mode.  As a result the host may\n   quickly run out of battery.\n   Bogus Paging\
    \ Areas\n   An attacker can periodically emit malicious packets in order to\n\
    \   confuse one or more hosts about their actual locations.  Currently,\n   there\
    \ is no efficient way to authenticate such packets.\n   In the case of IP paging,\
    \ these packets may also contain bogus paging\n   area information.  Upon receipt\
    \ of such a packet, a host may move and\n   send a location registration message\
    \ pointing to a non-existing or\n   wrong paging area.  The functional entities\
    \ of the IP paging protocol\n   may loose contact with the host.\n   More importantly,\
    \ this attack can serve for sorting out a host which\n   shows the behaviors 1\
    \ and 2 described in Section 3.1.\n   Bogus Paging Agents\n   An attacker can\
    \ wide cast fake paging messages pretending to be sent\n   by a paging agent.\
    \  The impacts will be similar to the ones described\n   in Sections 4.1 and 4.3.1.\
    \  However, depending on how the IP paging\n   protocol is designed, additional\
    \ harm may be caused.\n"
- title: 4.   Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.   Requirements\n   The following requirements are identified for the IP paging\
    \ protocol.\n"
- title: 4.1. Impact on Power Consumption
  contents:
  - "4.1. Impact on Power Consumption\n   The IP paging protocol MUST minimize impact\
    \ on the Host's dormant\n   mode operation, in order to minimize excessive power\
    \ drain.\n"
- title: 4.2. Scalability
  contents:
  - "4.2. Scalability\n   The IP paging protocol MUST be scalable to millions of Hosts.\n"
- title: 4.3. Control of Broadcast/Multicast/Anycast
  contents:
  - "4.3. Control of Broadcast/Multicast/Anycast\n   The protocol SHOULD provide a\
    \ filter mechanism to allow a Host prior\n   to entering dormant mode to filter\
    \ which broadcast/multicast/anycast\n   packets active a page.  This prevents\
    \ the Host from awakening out of\n   dormant mode for all broadcast/multicast/anycast\
    \ traffic.\n"
- title: 4.4. Efficient Signaling for Inactive Mode
  contents:
  - "4.4. Efficient Signaling for Inactive Mode\n   The IP paging protocol SHOULD\
    \ provide a mechanism for the Tracking\n   Agent to determine whether the Host\
    \ is in inactive mode, to avoid\n   paging when a host is completely unreachable.\n"
- title: 4.5. No Routers
  contents:
  - "4.5. No Routers\n   Since the basic issues involved in handling mobile routers\
    \ are not\n   well understood and since mobile routers have not exhibited a\n\
    \   requirement for paging, the IP paging protocol MAY NOT support\n   routers.\
    \  However, the IP paging protocol MAY support a router acting\n   as a Host.\n"
- title: 4.6. Multiple Dormant Modes
  contents:
  - "4.6. Multiple Dormant Modes\n   Recognizing that there are multiple possible\
    \ dormant modes on the\n   Host, the IP paging protocol MUST work with different\
    \ implementations\n   of dormant mode on the Host.\n"
- title: 4.7. Independence of Mobility Protocol
  contents:
  - "4.7. Independence of Mobility Protocol\n   Recognizing that IETF may support\
    \ multiple mobility protocols in the\n   future and that paging may be of value\
    \ to hosts that do not support a\n   mobility protocol, the IP paging protocol\
    \ MUST be designed so there\n   is no dependence on the underlying mobility protocol\
    \ or on any\n   mobility protocol at all.  The protocol SHOULD specify and provide\n\
    \   support for a mobility protocol, if the Host supports one.\n"
- title: 4.8. Support for Existing Mobility Protocols
  contents:
  - "4.8. Support for Existing Mobility Protocols\n   The IP paging protocol MUST\
    \ specify the binding to the existing IP\n   mobility protocols, namely mobile\
    \ IPv4 [2] and mobile IPv6 [3].  The\n   IP paging protocol SHOULD make use of\
    \ existing registration support.\n"
- title: 4.9. Dormant Mode Termination
  contents:
  - "4.9. Dormant Mode Termination\n   Upon receipt of a page (either with or without\
    \ an accompanying L3\n   packet), the Host MUST execute the steps in its mobility\
    \ protocol to\n   re-establish a routable L3 link with the Internet.\n"
- title: 4.10.   Network Updates
  contents:
  - "4.10.   Network Updates\n   Recognizing that locating a dormant mode mobile requires\
    \ the network\n   to have a rough idea of where the Host is located, the IP paging\n\
    \   protocol SHOULD provide the network a way for the Paging Agent to\n   inform\
    \ a dormant mode Host what paging area it is in and the IP\n   paging protocol\
    \ SHOULD provide a means whereby the Host can inform\n   the Target Agent when\
    \ it changes paging area.  The IP paging protocol\n   MAY additionally provide\
    \ a way for the Host to inform the Tracking\n   Agent what paging area it is in\
    \ at some indeterminate point prior to\n   entering dormant mode.\n"
- title: 4.11.   Efficient Utilization of L2
  contents:
  - "4.11.   Efficient Utilization of L2\n   Recognizing that many existing wireless\
    \ link protocols support paging\n   at L2 and that these protocols are often intimately\
    \ tied into the\n   Host's dormant mode support, the IP paging protocol SHOULD\
    \ provide\n   support to efficiently utilize an L2 paging protocol if available.\n"
- title: 4.12.   Orthogonality of Paging Area and Subnets
  contents:
  - "4.12.   Orthogonality of Paging Area and Subnets\n   The IP paging protocol MUST\
    \ allow an arbitrary mapping between\n   subnets and paging areas.\n"
- title: 4.13.   Future L3 Paging Support
  contents:
  - "4.13.   Future L3 Paging Support\n   Recognizing that future dormant mode and\
    \ wireless link protocols may\n   be designed that more efficiently utilize IP,\
    \ the IP paging protocol\n   SHOULD NOT require L2 support for paging.\n"
- title: 4.14.   Robustness Against Failure of Network Elements
  contents:
  - "4.14.   Robustness Against Failure of Network Elements\n   The IP paging protocol\
    \ MUST be designed to be robust with respect to\n   failure of network elements\
    \ involved in the protocol.  The self-\n   healing characteristics SHOULD NOT\
    \ be any worse than existing routing\n   protocols.\n"
- title: 4.15.   Reliability of Packet Delivery
  contents:
  - "4.15.   Reliability of Packet Delivery\n   The IP paging protocol MUST be designed\
    \ so that packet delivery is\n   reliable to a high degree of probability.  This\
    \ does not necessarily\n   mean that a reliable transport protocol is required.\n"
- title: 4.16.   Robustness Against Message Loss
  contents:
  - "4.16.   Robustness Against Message Loss\n   The IP paging protocol MUST be designed\
    \ to be robust with respect to\n   loss of messages.\n"
- title: 4.17.   Flexibility of Administration
  contents:
  - "4.17.   Flexibility of Administration\n   The IP paging protocol SHOULD provide\
    \ a way to flexibly auto-\n   configure Paging Agents to reduce the amount of\
    \ administration\n   necessary in maintaining a wireless network with paging.\n"
- title: 4.18.   Flexibility of Paging Area Design
  contents:
  - "4.18.   Flexibility of Paging Area Design\n   The IP paging protocol MUST be\
    \ flexible in the support of different\n   types of paging areas.  Examples are\
    \ fixed paging areas, where a\n   fixed set of bases stations belong to the paging\
    \ area for all Hosts,\n   and customized paging areas, where the set of base stations\
    \ is\n   customized for each Host.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.   Functional Architecture\n   In this section, a functional architecture is\
    \ developed that\n   describes the logical functional entities involved in IP\
    \ paging and\n   the interfaces between them.  Please note that the logical\n\
    \   architecture makes absolutely no commitment to any physical\n   implementation\
    \ of these functional entities whatsoever.  A physical\n   implementation may\
    \ merge particular functional entities.  For\n   example, the Paging Agent, Tracking\
    \ Agent, and Dormant Monitoring\n   Agent may all be merged into one in a particular\
    \ physical\n   implementation.  The purpose of the functional architecture is\
    \ to\n   identify the relevant system interfaces upon which protocol\n   development\
    \ may be required, but not to mandate that protocol\n   development will be required\
    \ on all.\n"
- title: 5.1. Functional Entities
  contents:
  - "5.1. Functional Entities\n   The functional architecture contains the following\
    \ elements:\n      Host - The Host (H) is a standard IP host in the sense of [4].\
    \ The\n      Host may be connected to a wired IP backbone through a wireless\n\
    \      link over which IP datagrams are exchanged (mobile usage pattern),\n  \
    \    or it may  be connected directly to a wired IP network, either\n      intermittently\
    \ (nomadic usage pattern) or constantly (wired usage\n      pattern).  The Host\
    \ may support some type of IP mobility protocol\n      (for example, mobile IP\
    \ [2] [3]).  The Host is capable of entering\n      dormant mode in order to save\
    \ power (see [1] for a detailed\n      discussion of dormant mode).  The Host\
    \ also supports a protocol\n      allowing the network to awaken it from dormant\
    \ mode if a packet\n      arrives.  This protocol may be a specialized L2 paging\
    \ channel or\n      it may be a time-slotted dormant mode in which the Host\n\
    \      periodically wakes up and listens to L2 for IP traffic, the\n      details\
    \ of the L2 implementation are not important.  A dormant\n      Host is also responsible\
    \ for determining when its paging area has\n      changed and for responding to\
    \ changes in paging area by directly\n      or indirectly informing the Tracking\
    \ Agent about its location.\n      Since routers are presumed not to require dormant\
    \ mode support, a\n      Host is never a router.\n      Paging Agent - The Paging\
    \ Agent is responsible for alerting the\n      Host when a packet arrives and\
    \ the Host is in dormant mode.\n      Alerting of the Host proceeds through a\
    \ protocol that is peculiar\n      to the L2 link and to the Host's dormant mode\
    \ implementation,\n      though it may involve IP if supported by the L2.  Additionally,\n\
    \      the Paging Agent maintains paging areas by periodically wide\n      casting\
    \ information over the Host's link to identify the paging\n      area.  The paging\
    \ area information may be wide cast at L2 or it\n      may also involve IP.  Each\
    \ paging area is served by a unique\n      Paging Agent.\n      Tracking Agent\
    \ - The Tracking Agent is responsible for tracking a\n      Host's location while\
    \ it is in dormant mode or active mode, and\n      for determining when Host enters\
    \ inactive mode.  It receives\n      updates from a dormant Host when the Host\
    \ changes paging area.\n      When a packet arrives for the Host at the Dormant\
    \ Monitoring\n      Agent, the Tracking Agent is responsible for notifying the\
    \ Dormant\n      Monitoring Agent, upon request, what Paging Agent is in the Host's\n\
    \      last reported paging area.  There is a one to one mapping between\n   \
    \   a Host and a Tracking Agent.\n      Dormant Monitoring Agent - The Dormant\
    \ Monitoring Agent detects\n      the delivery of packets to a Host that is in\
    \ Dormant Mode (and\n      thus does not have an active L2 connection to the Internet).\
    \  It\n      is the responsibility of the Dormant Monitoring Agent to query the\n\
    \      Tracking Agent for the last known Paging Agent for the Host, and\n    \
    \  inform the Paging Agent to page the Host.  Once the Paging Agent\n      has\
    \ reported that a routable connection to the Internet exists to\n      the Host,\
    \ the Dormant Monitoring Agent arranges for delivery of\n      the packet to the\
    \ Host.  In addition, the Host or its Tracking\n      Agent may select a Dormant\
    \ Monitoring Agent for a Host when the\n      Host enters dormant mode, and periodically\
    \ as the Host changes\n      paging area.\n"
- title: 5.2. Interfaces
  contents:
  - "5.2. Interfaces\n   The functional architecture generates the following list\
    \ of\n   interfaces.  Note that the interfaces between functional entities\n \
    \  that are combined into a single network element will require no\n   protocol\
    \ development.\n      Host - Paging Agent (H-PA) - The H-PA interface supports\

    \ information from the Paging\n            Agent.\n         -  The Paging Agent\

    \ the Tracking Agent when it has changed\n            paging area, and, optionally,\
    \ prior to entering dormant\n            mode, in what paging area it is located.\n\
    \         -  Optionally, the Host informs the Tracking Agent at a planned\n  \
    \          transition to inactive mode.\n      Dormant Monitoring Agent - Tracking\
    \ Agent (DMA-TA) - The DMA-TA\n      interface supports the following types of\
    \ traffic:\n         -  A report from the Dormant Monitoring Agent to the Tracking\n\
    \            Agent that a packet has arrived for a dormant Host for which\n  \
    \          no route is available.\n         -  A report from the Tracking Agent\
    \ to the Dormant Monitoring\n            Agent giving the Paging Agent to contact\
    \ in order to page\n            the Host.\n         -  A report from the Tracking\
    \ Agent to the Dormant Monitoring\n            Agent that a Host has entered inactive\
    \ mode, if not provided\n            directly by the Host\n         -  A report\
    \ from the Tracking Agent to the Dormant Monitoring\n            Agent that a\
    \ Host has entered dormant mode, if not provided\n            directly by the\
    \ Host.\n      Dormant Monitoring Agent - Paging Agent (DMA-PA) - The DMA-PA\n\
    \      interface supports the following types of traffic:\n         -  A request\
    \ from the Dormant Monitoring Agent to the Paging\n            Agent to page a\
    \ particular Host in dormant mode because a\n            packet has arrived for\
    \ the Host.\n         -  Negative response indication from the Paging Agent if\
    \ the\n            Host does not respond to a page.\n         -  Positive response\
    \ from the Paging Agent indication if the\n            Host does respond to a\
    \ page.\n         -  Delivery of the packet to the Host.\n      Host - Dormant\
    \ Monitoring Agent (H-DMA) - The H-DMA interface\n      supports the following\
    \ types of traffic:\n         -  The Host registers to the Dormant Monitoring\
    \ Agent prior to\n            entering dormant mode, (if needed) with filtering\n\
    \            information on which broadcast/multicast/anycast packets\n      \
    \      trigger a page.\n         -  The Host informs the Dormant Monitoring Agent,\
    \ when it\n            directly deregisters from the Dormant Monitoring Agent\
    \ due\n            to a change from dormant mode to active or inactive mode.\n"
